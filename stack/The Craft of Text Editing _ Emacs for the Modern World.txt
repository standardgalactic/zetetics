Preface 
Just over eleven years ago I was faced with selecting a topic for my thesis. At 
the time, I was a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 
was working on my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 
One of the degree requirements was a thesis, and you can't have a thesis 
without a topic. 
During my four years at M.lT., a new type of text editor had come into 
being and widespread use. This type of text editor was called "Emacs," and it 
was a major step forward in many ways. Implementations of this type of 
editor were appearing on many computer systems. Some people even used an 
implementation as the basis for their thesis. I took a different tack. The idea 
that I settled on for my thesis was a description of the technology that 
underlies all text editors, but with a special emphasis on Emacs-type editors. 
The thesis was written and published as a technical memo (Fin seth 1980). 
Ten years later, I was reading the USENET News news group Compo 
editors, one of the many facets of that worldwide electronic bulletin board. A 
discussion thread had started up in which both sides of the discussion were 
citing my thesis as the authority in the field. Further inquiries (not by me: I 
was just reading along) showed that no one in that group was aware of any 
other document that described general text-editing technology. 
My thesis was ten years old: it predated most personal computers and 
workstations. There had even been a chapter in an early draft that attempted 
to prove that it was not possible to implement an Emacs-type text editor on 
a small computer. (I invented a way, threw out the chapter, and with some 
friends started a software company to market such an editor. Oh well.) It was 
clearly time for a complete rewrite, and that rewrite is what you are reading 
now. 
If you don't have a copy of my thesis (or the Technical Memo: the two 
have identical content), you won't miss anything. This book has all of the 
information from the earlier document, and is now updated. It also has a 
whole lot more. Every part has been completely rewritten and expanded, and 
major sections have been added. 
As with my thesis, this book is written in an informal, almost chatty style.

Preface 
It is addressed directly to "you," who are assumed to care about how text 
editors are implemented. Be warned, however, that it also contains opinions 
about the "right" and "wrong" way of doing things and that these opinions 
hold that many of the current directions and trends are-shall we say?-not 
the "right" way. You should keep in mind that you should not accept every-
thing said in here as the gospel truth, but understand why I say what I say 
and make your own informed judgment. 
This book is addressed to anyone who implements large software systems 
or who wants to know the considerations that go into such systems. It focuses 
around text editors. Although not required, an understanding of program-
ming will be helpful. 
Questions to Probe Your Understanding 
Each chapter ends with a set of questions and problems designed to probe 
your understanding of the material that was just presented. And, true to the 
Socratic method, some of these questions also introduce new material. The 
level of difficulty of the questions ranges from very easy to quite difficult, and 
each question is labelled to help you gauge how much effort is required. Just 
as with most programming issues, most questions have no single correct 
answer.

Introduction: What Is 
Text Editing All About? 
'Twas brillig. and the slithy toves 
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves. 
And the mome raths outgrabe. 
In its most general form, text editing is the process of taking some input, 
changing it, and producing some output. Ideally, the desired changes would 
be made immediately and with no effort required beyond the mere thought 
of the change. Unfortunately, the ideal case is not yet achievable. We are thus 
consigned to using tools such as computers to effect our desired changes. 
Computers have physical limitations. These limitations include the nature 
of user-interface devices; CPU performance; memory constraints, both 
physical and virtual; and disk capacity and transfer speed. Computer pro-
grams that perform text editing must operate within these limitations. This 
book examines those limitations, explores tradeoffs among them and the 
algorithms that implement specific tradeoffs, and provides general guidance 
to anyone who wants to understand how to implement a text editor or how 
to perform editing in general. 
I do not present the complete source code to an editor, nor is the source 
code available on disk (however, see Appendix B). For that matter, you won't 
even see a completely worked out algorithm. Rather, this book teaches the 
craft of text editing so that you can understand how to construct your own 
editor. 
The first chapters discuss external constraints: human mental processes, file 
formats, and interface devices. Later chapters describe memory management, 
redisplay algorithms, and command set structure in detail. The last chapter 
explores the Emacs type of editor. The Emacs type of editor will also be used 
whenever a reference to a specific editor is required. 
This range of topics is quite broad, and it is easy to lose sight of the forest 
with all of those trees. The remainder of this introduction will sketch the 
outlines of the forest by examining an editor-in-miniature: a get-line-of-input 
routine. We will start with a basic version of the routine, then make it more 

2 
Introduction: What Is Text Editing All About? 
elaborate in a series of steps. By the end, you will see where the complexity of 
a text editor arises from. 
The program examples are written in the ANSI version of the C language. 
Appendix A provides a brief introduction to the C language and explains all 
of the features used in examples. 
The Basic Get_Line 
The Get-Line routine accepts these inputs: 
• A prompt string 
• A buffer to accept the input; this buffer must be at least two characters long 
• An indication of the buffer length 
and produces these outputs: 
• A success/fail status 
• If the status is "success," the input is stored in the supplied buffer; the end 
of the input is marked with the NUL character 
• If the status is "fail," the buffer may have been modified but will not 
contain valid input 
The editing performed by this routine is on the input buffer. This first 
version assumes that you are creating a new item from scratch each time. 
Version One 
FLAG GeLLine(char *prompt, char *buffer, int len) 
{ 
char *cptr = buffer; 
int key; 
if (len < 2) return (FALSE); 
/* safety check * / 
printf("%s:", prompt); 
for (;;) { 
} 
key = KeyGet(); 
if (isprint (key» { 
if (cptr - buffer> = len - 1) Beep (); 
else { 
} 
*cptr++ = key; 
pri ntf ("%c", key); 
} 
else if (key == KEYENTER) { 
*cptr = NUL; 
printf("\n"); 
return (TRUE); 
} 
else Beep (); 
} 

The Basic Get-Line 
3 
Version One accepts input until the user presses the Enter key. If a user's 
input will overflow the input buffer, the input is discarded and the program 
will sound an error beep. Once the Enter key has been pressed, the program 
appends a NUL character to terminate the string and returns True. Non-
printing characters other than Enter also cause the program to sound an 
error beep. Simple, straightforward, and useless, as there is no way for the user 
to correct any typing mistakes. 
Version Two 
Here is Version Two. It adds editing: 
FLAG GeLLine(char "prompt, char "buffer, int len) 
{ 
char "cptr = buffer; 
int key; 
if (len < 2) return (FALSE); 
/* safety check" / 
printf("%s:", prompt); 
for (;;) { 
Key = KeyGet (); 
if (isprint (key» { 
. 
if (cptr - buffer> = len - 1) Beep(); 
else { 
, 
"cptr++ = key; 
printf("%c", key); 
} 
} 
else { 
} 
switch (key) { 
case KEY BACK: 
if (cptr > buffer) { 
cptr--; 
printf(,,\b \b"); 
} 
break; 
case KEYENTER: 
"cptr = NUL; 
printf("\n"); 
return (TRUE); 
/* break; * / 
defqult: 
} 
Beep(); 
break; 
} 
Version Two starts developing problems that can no longer be swept under 
the rug. 

4 
Introduction: What Is Text Editing All About? 
Version One glossed over exactly what is meant by the Enter key. That's 
sort of okay. Most keyboards have only one key labelled "Enter" or "Return" 
or something similar. It almost always sends a Carriage Return character. 
The program can compare against just that character and almost always 
operate "correctly," i.e., as the user expects. However, most keyboards have 
at least two keys for erasing: Back Space and Delete. Some people and 
computer systems use one of these. Other people and computer systems use 
the other. (We will ignore any extra "erase" or "delete character" keys that 
you might find. For now.) The program can handle this problem in several 
ways: 
• Accept only one or the other 
• Accept both 
• If the operating system supports some sort of "terminal parameter con-
figuration," ask the operating system what character to use 
• Provide a configuration option in your program to let the user set his or 
her preferred character; the option will most likely default to the operating 
system configuration setting if one is available 
If you picked the first option, just over half of your users will be upset with 
you. The second option is much better: almost all users will like you, and this 
part of your program need not be operating system specific at all. (I often 
select this option when writing small programs that should have a minimum 
of operating system-dependant code.) The third option is a fine solution. 
Most users will like you, and you are building on other work (i.e., the operat-
ing system) instead of reinventing the wheel. 
If you picked the fourth option, you have already learned what an Emacs-
type editor is about. Implicit in this option is recognizing that users should 
be able to control their environment as much as possible. Yes, it is more work 
to write such programs and, yes, it sometimes overlaps the existing operating 
system, but it can be well worth the effort. Another problem appears in the 
statement: 
printf("\ b\ b"); 
This statement is a crude attempt at erasing a character. As it turns out, 
there are pretty powerful conventions regarding how printing characters and 
newlines are handled by operating systems and output devices. These char-
acters all move the cursor to the right or to the start of the next line. However, 
when you want the cursor to back up in any way or you wish to control it in 
any other way, you are on your own: there are no industry-wide conventions 
for specifying these operations. And, with no conventions to rely upon, your 
program has to implement a method of coping with the range of output 
devices. 
Version Three 
Version Three assumes that the input buffer contains some text. This text is 
used for the response if the user just presses Enter (i.e., the text is the default 

value): 
FLAG Get-Line (char 'prompt, char 'buffer, int len) 
{ 
char 'cptr = buffer; 
FLAG waskey = FALSE; 
int key; 
The Basic Get-Line 
5 
if (len < 2) return (FALSE); 
1* safety check' f 
for (;;) { 
ToStartOfLine (); 
ClearLine( ); 
printf("%s: %s", prompt, buffer); 
key = KeyGet(); 
if (isprint (key» { 
if (!waskey) { 
'buffer = NUL; 
waskey = TRUE; 
} 
if (cptr - buffer > = len - 1) Beep (); 
else { 
} 
'cptr++ = key; 
'cptr = NUL; 
} 
else { 
} 
switch (key) { 
case KEYBACK: 
if (!waskey) { 
'buffer = NUL; 
waskey = TRUE; 
} 
if (cptr > buffer) { 
--cptr; 
'cptr = NUL; 
printf("\b\ b"); 
} 
break; 
case KEYENTER: 
printf("\n"); 
return (TRUE); 
1* break; 'f 
default: 
Beep(); 
break; 
} 
Version Three returns the supplied response if the user just presses the 
Enter key. Otherwise, the supplied response is erased completely the first time 
a printing key or Back Space is pressed. The only other changes worth noting 

6 
Introduction: What Is Text Editing All About? 
are that the prompt has been moved to the inside of the loop and a few 
terminal interface routines have been added. The first one moves the "cursor" 
to the beginning of the line. The next clears the line. 
Version Four 
This version adds a number of features: 
• Commands to move the cursor left and right 
• Insert/replace editing 
• A command to delete the character to the right of the cursor 
• Commands to move to the beginning and end of the response 
• A command to clear the response 
• A command to clear the changes and restore the default 
• A way to insert arbitrary characters, including command characters, into 
the response 
• A cancel key 
• A redisplay key 
This version of the routine also has a slight change to the interface: the 
addition of a separate default value parameter. 
FLAG GeLLine(char *prompt, char *buffer, int len, char 'default) 
{ 
char 'cptr = buffer; 
FLAG isinsert = TRUE; 
FLAG waskey = TRUE;

/* set replace mode * / 
Version Four does all that was claimed for it, but not as well as one would 
like. In particular: 
• It did not check to ensure that the default response fits within the buffer. 
• There was no way for the user to determine whether the program is in 
insert or replace mode except by typing a character and finding out what 
happens. 
• It assumed that all characters are the same width when displayed. 
• It did not address the question of what the commands are nor how the user 
supposed to remember them all. 
The Forest 
The examples presented in this chapter bumped into these problems: 
• What characteristics of the display and keyboard affect text editing? 
• How should the program cope with presenting output on different dis-

Users 
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
The saying goes: "Business would be great if it weren't for customers." Well, 
programming would be easy if it weren't for users. In the simple case, there 
would be exactly one user for your program-yourself-and you would use 
it only once. Most programs, however, are used many times by many people. 
You must take those users into account when designing your program. 
This chapter will only review those aspects of users that are most relevant 
to text editing: full discussions of users and design can and do fill many books 
in themselves, some of which are listed in the Bibliography. This chapter (and 
this book) does not address the question of non-people users. 
User Categories 
Each user can be placed in a category. Each category is described in terms of 
the amount and the type of experience. It is important to understand users: 
each user creates a model of how a new program works based on his or 
her experience with other programs combined with the "hints" that your 
program's user interface gives to him or her. It is up to you to either match 
your program's behavior to your users' model(s) or to give them enough 
information so that they generate a model that is well-matched to your 
program. 
Amount of Experience 
The amount of experience that a user has is a point on a continuous scale. All 
users start with no experience and accumulate experience as they learn. 
Although the scale is continuous, I have divided it into five regions in order to 
simplify discussion. Also, this list is not intended as a self-rating scale: most 
of you who are reading this book will be programmers.

1. Users 
Neophyte users barely know what a computer is. They lack understanding 
of such "basic" terms as "file" and "file name" (the concepts behind these 
terms are actually quite sophisticated). This lack of understanding does not 
mean that they are unintelligent people, only that they have never had a 
reason to learn these concepts. If you are designing a program for this type 
of user, you may feel both blessed and cursed. Cursed because it can be so 
difficult, and blessed because this area of program design has such a pressing 
need for good designs. 
Experience from the field of artificial intelligence can shed more light on 
this issue. AI researchers found it (comparatively) easy to write programs that 
can handle advanced mathematics such as freshman calculus. However, as the 
researchers pushed on to handle such easy (to most people) areas as filling in 
coloring books, the programming problems got harder and harder. Some of 
this difficulty is due to the fact that the task of teaching college-level courses 
is well understood-especially by college professors-but teaching coloring 
is not. For example, how many textbooks have you seen on "how to color"? 
More to the point, computers have been designed to process information in 
a certain way, one that is mathematically elegant, but not necessarily related 
to how people's minds work. As people write programs for more and more 
"basic" tasks, this difference becomes increasingly apparent. 
Many programs have been (mis-)designed for neophyte users. They often 
offer a few simple commands, yet leave intact such difficult concepts such as 
that of a "file." They solve the wrong problem, sort oflike travelling to a place 
where a foreign language is spoken, and trying to communicate by speaking 
your native language slowly and distinctly. As a program designer, you must 
understand the thought structure of your users, and design programs that 
match that structure. The blessing comes from designing programs that are 
very different from "conventional" programs and which are well-matched to 
their users. 
Novice users have used a computer before, perhaps for text editing, word 
processing, spread sheet, or database applications. In any event, novice users 
have some familiarity with the idea of typing things into a box and seeing a 
response that somehow reflects their typing. They understand how a shift key 
works, that a lowercase letter '1? is not the same as a digit '1', and so forth. 
They even have some understanding of the idea of "context:" that keys do 
different things at different times. Users with this amount of experience are 
able to operate almost any program that has a good design and a decent 
manual. 
Basic users are like novice users, only more so. They understand such 
programming concepts as thread of control, variables, and statements like 
"A = A + 1" (in fact, many people call such users "programmers"). These 
users can operate any program, even one with a poor design. Given source 
code to the program they are able to customize and extend it, albeit in what 
might be an awkward fashion. 
Power users know one or more application programs thoroughly. They 

"Religion" 
13 
understand not only how to use those programs fully, but can often go 
beyond the bounds of what the original designers intended. They may write 
large programs in the form of application macros, but do not design these 
programs. These users understand the fine points of the programs that they 
use. 
Programmer-level users understand the theory of programming. When 
writing a large program, they design the program before implementing 
it. They generalize, applying their experience and their knowledge of one 
program to guess how another program will operate. 
Type of Experience 
The amount-of-experience scale is one-dimensional: people start at the 
beginning and proceed along the scale as they gain experience. The type of 
experience scale is more like a collection of baseball cards. A user can collect 
the experience types (cards) in any order, and two people with the same 
number of experience types (cards) may have no experience types (cards) in 
common. 
The experience types do not necessarily carryover: experience gained on 
one type of system mayor may not prove useful on another. Actually, 
experience gained on one system may make it more difficult to learn another. 
And, if users grow to like one type of system, they may then dislike another 
one, thus making any experience transfer problematic. 
These experience types can have a major effect on the design of your 
programs, as it is usually important for new programs to appear and operate 
in a manner similar to existing programs. Thus, the (possibly bad) designs of 
those existing programs may have to be carried into the design of your 
program. 
"Religion" 
This section might also be titled "religious preference." In the computer field, 
"religion" is a technical term that refers to the usually irrational and extreme 
preference of one program, style, or method to another. Although you cannot 
really do anything about this phenomenon, you can keep it in mind when 
analyzing comments on your design. 
It has been observed that people often "get religion" over the first applica-
tion (for example, a word processor) that they use. I can't recall the number 
of people who have tried to convince me that the program that they just 
discovered (i.e., the first one they used) is the best one in the world. This form 
of "religion" is normal and derives from the facts that (1) the move from 
manual to automated methods (e.g., from typewriters to word processors) 
involves a major increase in capabilities: even the simplest word processor 
provides vastly more capabilities than does a typewriter, and (2) new users do 

14 
1. Users 
not have the experience to realize that all programs (e.g., word processors) are 
not equal. This form of religion usually fades away over time as new users 
gain experience. 
In a hauntingly close parallel to the "second system effect" (Brooks 1982), 
the "second program users" are the ones to watch out for. These people 
started using one program, then gave that program up in favor of a second 
one. The problem is that they think that since the second program is better 
than the first one (which it usually is), it must therefore be better than all the 
rest. 
There is nothing in particular that you can do about users that feel religious 
about a program: rational arguments are in general ignored. You can, how-
ever, be aware that such users exist, and recognize when you are dealing with 
one. 
User Goals 
Knowing your user's experience is essential, but a program design must 
incorporate knowledge of what task or tasks the user is trying to accomplish. 
For text editors, he or she might want to create: 
• Some jottings, format not important; 
• Some jottings, format important; 
• Some jottings within a structure (e.g., outlines); 
• Something with a specialized format (e.g., a business letter or a poem); 
• A short narrative document (e.g., a school paper or short story); 
• A longer document (e.g., a long paper or book); 
• A long document with complex formatting (e.g., a mathematics textbook); 
• A computer program; 
• Data for a program; or 
• Something else. 
The frequency of doing these tasks can range from occasionally to con-
tinuously. Different tasks can be performed by the same user with different 
frequencies. 
The style of doing these tasks can also vary. One person may do all of one 
task, then start on the next. Another person may be frequently switching 
among two or more tasks. 
Physiological Constraints 
Users are people. There are limits to what people can do. These limits must 
be considered when designing a program. 
Hands have a limited reach. The very act of reaching for one key draws a 
hand away from other keys. Thus, commands that you expect to follow one 

Physiological Constraints 
15 
another should be assigned with that constraint in mind. Function keys are 
often difficult to find and awkward to press. While there are almost always 
two shift keys, most keyboards only have one control (or equivalent) key and 
may only have one of other types of shift keys. Thus, it is difficult to press 
some shifted keys (such as control-P) with just one hand. 
Non-keyboard devices such as mice draw a hand far away from the 
keyboard-and you don't in general know whether it is the left or right hand 
that is drawn away. A sequence such as control-mouse button may be very 
difficult for some (i.e., left-handed) users to type. 
Eyes can focus on a limited area of high resolution surrounded by a large 
area of lower resolution. However, areas of strong contrast such as reverse 
video are still visible in low-resolution areas. Blinking items are not only 
visible, but will draw the eye to them. "Status" displays should therefore 
change as quietly as possible so as not to draw the eye away from the text 
under edit. For example, it may make sense to place such status areas on the 
top part of the display if insert/delete line operations cause visible motion of 
the bottom part. 
The mind (or brain), however, places the greatest constraints on editor 
design. It is only capable of processing a few thoughts ("instructions") per 
second. In order for users to be productive, it is important that these thoughts 
be directed as much as possible to useful editing operations. There are several 
things to consider regarding these thoughts. 
First, mental effort (thought) is required to translate between the display 
representation of the text being edited and the user's internal representation. 
The WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") principle reduces this effort 
by reducing the amount of thought required. Note that in general WYSIWYG 
does not mean "fancy output on a graphics display." Rather, it means "it is 
what it appears to be, no more and no less." 
Second, the mind has expectations: it sees (and in general senses) what it 
expects to see. In extreme cases, if something totally unexpected happens, it 
can take many seconds for the mind to even recognize that there is an 
unexpected image, in addition to the time required to process the image and 
make a decision. Thus, it is important for the program to anticipate what the 
mind will expect to see and to arrange the display accordingly. 
Third, it takes mental effort to handle special cases. For example, if the 
delete operation deletes everything except for newlines, it takes effort to 
remember that difference and to monitor each command that is being given 
to ensure that it conforms to the restriction. 
Fourth, it takes mental effort to plan ahead. The design of the editor should 
make it easy for the user to change his or her mind. 
Last, it takes mental effort to track modes. (Chapter 9 goes into modes in 
detail.) Each time a new mode is introduced, it takes mental effort to track the 
state of the mode and adds effort to the process of switching modes. 
The mind's short-memory can hold from five to seven "chunks" of inform a-
tion (Norman 1990). These chunks are organized in a cache-like form. When 

16 
1. Users 
the chunk cache fills up, chunks must be stored in "main memory," a process 
that takes time. Considering that some of these chunks are used to remember 
what is being edited, why the editing is being done, and other such context, it 
becomes clear that the editor should be designed to use as few of these 
"chunks" as possible. 
The mind is poor at thinking numerically. It is much easier to think in 
terms of "put that there" than "put object 12856 at location 83456." These last 
two points mean that the computer should do as much remembering as 
possible for the user. 
Applying These Physiological Constraints 
Let us examine how these principles apply to a particular user: me. I select 
myself as the example for the simple reason that I understand how my mind 
works better than I understand anyone else's. 
First, I almost always work with plain ASCII files. Hence, I can take 
advantage of WYSIWYG on even a simple ASCII terminal. 
Second, the program/computer combination that I use can (mostly) keep 
up with my typing in real time. 
Third, the Emacs command set that I use is very regular, so my mind need 
only keep track of a few special cases. 
Fourth, the basic paradigm behind the Emacs command set is "move to 
desired position, make desired change." This paradigm applies even in the case 
where I made a mistake, as I simply add the mistake to the list of changes to 
be made and continue to apply the paradigm. I never have to change mental 
gears. The penalty for making a mistake is thus minimized. 
Fifth, the program minimizes what I need to remember: the text being 
edited is there to be seen, exactly as is, and there are very few state variables 
to track. In addition, the Emacs command set is defined mainly in terms of 
objects (character, word, sentence, etc.) and has a convenient way of saying 
"some," "a lot," "a whole lot," and "a huge amount." (Various aspects of 
Emacs command set are discussed in later chapters.) 
Going beyond these principles, I have used the Emacs command set so long 
(thirteen years) that I quip that most of my editing is performed by my spinal 
cord and not my brain. Although this quip is not true since the spinal cord 
can only handle purely reflex actions, we wi11look closely at how my mind 
functions when editing text. The mind of any other experienced user should 
operate in a similar fashion. 
As I write this text, part of my mind is articulating the point that I am trying 
to make, while another part is expanding those words into their component 
characters. Call these parts the "source process." Another part of my mind is 
translating those characters into finger motions. Call this part the "keystroke 
process." Other parts of my mind are reading the text as it appears on the 

Applying These Physiological Constraints 
17 
screen, turning it back into words, and matching these words against the 
original word stream. Call this the "feedback process." 
These three processes work in any sort of writing: using a computer, 
typewriter, or pen. All people who write use them. However, if the resulting 
text is to have few errors, one of two things must have happened: either the 
user made very few mistakes (thus minimizing the number of errors to be 
corrected) or the user must have written slowly, giving the feedback loop 
enough time to recognize an error before too much time has elapsed and 
the error becomes difficult to correct (such as an omitted character on the 
previous line or page). 
With the advent of computers, and their ability to make seamless correc-
tions, a third option appeared: a new, fast feedback loop. This loop operates 
by giving the keystroke process the ability to recognize that it made a mistake. 
This extra ability is not useful without seamless editing, as it takes a long time 
to use the eraser or correction tape. However, with (a lot of) practice, a fourth 
process can be "running:" the "editing process." 
The editing process takes the feedback from the keystroke process and 
inserts editing commands into the character stream created by the source 
process. Here is an example of how this editing might operate to correct an 
error when writing the text "the quick red fox." 
• The source process generates the appropriate character string. 
• An error occurs. What is actually typed on the keyboard is the string "teh". 
• The keystroke process recognizes the error just after the "h" was typed. 
• The editing process takes time to run. In this time, let us suppose that the 
characters" quick" (that is a space, followed by "quick") were placed in the 
"output queue." It is reasonable to suppose that all of the characters for 
each word will be placed on the queue in one operation. 
• The editing process then places its own string of characters on the output 
queue. This string will correct the error. For the Emacs command set, the 
sequence might be ""[b"B"T"E". This sequence means "move back a 
word (" " [b"), move back one more character (" " B"), interchange the two 
switched characters (" "T": swaps "eh" to "he"), return to the end of the 
line (" " E"). 
• The rest of the line is then processed as usual, with the characters "red 
fox" placed on the queue in two chunks and eventually typed correctly. At 
some later time, the feedback process confirms that the phrase was typed 
correctly. 
(Other users may have variations on this process. For example, they may 
always delete all of any word with an error and retype the word.) 
With the extra fast feedback loop, the fingers were kept typing at full speed 
all the time. Granted, an extra five characters were typed, but consider what 
would happen without the extra loop. It could well be that the entire phrase 
would have been typed before the error was noticed. The source process 
would have already started on the next phrase. When the feedback process 

18 
1. Users 
notices the error, the smooth typing of characters would stop as the user's 
mind determines exactly which corrections are required and how to perform 
them. It must then start the pipeline going again. The stopping, correcting, 
and starting again takes several seconds. A fifty word-per-minute typist is 
typing about five characters per second. The Emacs correction string would 
take one second to type. There is thus a direct saving of some seconds and an 
indirect saving due to not having interrupted the smooth flow of thinking. 
Note that the design of the command set played an important part in 
making this loop usable. For example, if no "go backward word" opera-
tion were available, the editing process would have to compute how many 
characters were in the "output buffer," an operation that is quite time-
consuming (quick: how many letters in "brown"?) as well as not well matched 
to how the mind works. 
Some recent industry trends illustrate how some "user friendly" designs 
clash with this editing process. Consider a typical, modern window system. In 
some ways, it acts to frustrate an experienced user. For example, when a user 
closes a modified file, the computer may put up a dialog box that says 
"Discard changes? Yes, No, Cancel" (or words to the same effect). This 
prompt will be displayed in a beautiful dialog box, neatly centered on the 
screen. Each response will have its own button. Unfortunately, even if the user 
is expecting the dialog box, he or she may have to wait for the system to catch 
up for these reasons: 
• The operating system does not know about the dialog box until the 
program has informed it of the box. Hence, if the mouse button is pressed 
too early, the button-press event will be sent to the main window and not 
the dialog box. 
• While the user knows that the dialog box will appear in the center of the 
screen, it is in general too difficult to predict precisely where the (dialog 
box) button will show up to be able to "mouse ahead." Hence, the mouse 
button cannot be pressed until the box is drawn. 
For these reasons, an experienced user's editing process may be inter-
rupted. These interrupts no doubt contribute to the feeling of sluggishness 
that many experienced users still feel when using such systems. The challenge 
is to design your program so that experienced users can productively use your 
program. The steps that you can take to facilitate this use include: 
• Keep dialog box choices consistent 
• Provide keyboard responses for all choices 
• Provide for typeahead 
• Be prepared to handle mis-directed events 
In general, the goal is for an experienced user to be able to accurately 
predict which responses will be required, and to reliably supply those 
responses in advance of the prompts. In this way, experienced users can 
continue to do their work, without being slowed down by the system.

Users Who Have Handicaps 
When someone has a significantly reduced ability to do something, that 
person is considered to be handicapped in that area. The reduced ability 
might be physical, such as reduced hand motion or poor eyesight, or it might 
be mental, such as a reduced ability to remember things. 
While the number of people who have severe handicaps in many areas is 
small, a large number of users have at least limited handicaps in a few areas. 
As it is important for programs to accommodate as wide a range of users as 
possible, programs must accommodate users with handicaps. 
It is also important to keep in mind that those users that have severe and/or 
multiple handicaps can benefit greatly from the use of computers. 
Sometimes, even users without a handicap benefit from designs intended to 
aid users with handicaps. For example, adding a wheelchair ramp to an old 
building also allows other people to roll heavy objects up the ramp instead of 
having to use stairs. 
The main design principles to follow to take into account users with 
handicaps are: 
• Reduce mental complexity: have the user deal with only one object or 
concept at a time. 
• Reduce visual complexity: keep displays clean and to the point and avoid 
clutter. 
• Reduce manual complexity: allow the user to do everything with just one 
finger (this does not mean to force the user to do everything with one 
finger). Keep commands simple. Allow shortcuts and shorthand where 
applicable. 
• Provide for customization. If you are lucky, the operating system will do 
this for you. 
It is not surprising that these are also good design rules for users without 
handicaps.

User Interface Hardware 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
The frumious Bandersnatch!" 
User interface hardware is the collection of devices you use when interacting 
with the computer. The currently available user interface hardware usually 
consists of a display screen for output and a keyboard and perhaps a mouse 
or other graphical input device for input. This chapter will first discuss 
the output side: the screen. It will then discuss the input side: the key-
board. Finally, it will discuss the communications paths that tie the two parts 
together. 
Displa y Types 
In the old days (i.e., the early 1980s), almost all displays were part of character-
based terminals. Differences in capabilities among the terminals were often 
crucial. These differences play an important part in the types of redisplay 
schemes that are workable (redisplay is discussed in Chapter 7). Thus, it is 
worth reviewing the old display types. 
TTY and Glass TTY 
A TTY is the canonical printing terminal. Printing terminals have the 
property that what is once written can never be unwritten. A glass TTY is the 
same as a TTY except that it uses a screen instead of paper. It has no random 
cursor positioning, no way of backing up, and no way of changing what was 
displayed. They are quieter than printing terminals, though. 
When a text editor is used on one of these displays, it usually maintains a 
very small window (e.g., one line) and either echos only newly typed text or 
else constantly redisplays (i.e., reprints) that small window. Once a user is 
familiar with a display editor, however, it is possible-in a crunch-to edit 
from a terminal of this type, but this is not generally a pleasant way to work. 

22 
2. User Interface Hardware 
Although one would hope that this type of display was gone for good, 
it does crop up from time to time in poorly implemented window schemes. 
Some window schemes offer window interfaces that resemble printing 
terminals-all too well. 
You may encounter one other type of "write only" scheme: a Unix-style 
output stream. As an editor writer, you may want to check for this and either: 
• Alter your output accordingly, or 
• Don't alter your output 
You may want to alter your output if you feel that the user wants to create 
some sort of "audit trail" type file. On the other hand; you would not want 
to alter your output if the user is attempting to diagnose problems by record-
ing the data that is sent to the display. 
Basic Displays 
A basic display has, as a bare minimum, some sort of cursor positioning. It 
will generally also have "clear to end of line" operation (put blanks on the 
screen from the current cursor position to the end of the line that the cursor 
is on) and "clear to end of screen" (ditto, but to the end of the screen) 
functions. These functions can be simulated, if necessary, by sending spaces 
and newlines. A typical basic terminal is (was) the DEC VTS2. 
Such displays are quite usable at higher speeds (for example, over a 9600 
bps connection) but usability deteriorates rapidly as the speed decreases. 
Speaking from experience, it requires patience to use basic displays over a 
1200 bps connection, and a dedication bordering on insanity to use them at 
300 bps. 
Advanced Displays 
Advanced displays have all of the features of the basic displays, along with 
editing features such as "insert" and "delete line and/or character" These 
features can significantly reduce the amount of data sent to the display for 
common operations. A typical advanced (circa 1980) terminal is the DEC 
VT100. Most terminals currently manufactured are at least as powerful as this 
one. 
There is a subtle difference among some of the advanced terminals. An 
"insert line" operation adds one or more blank lines at the cursor: the lines 
that "drop off' the bottom of the screen are lost. A "delete line" operation 
deletes one or more lines at the cursor: blank lines are inserted at the bottom. 
A "scroll window" operation (move lines x through y up/down n lines) affects 
only the specified lines: the other ones remain stationary. 
The "scroll window" operation is more pleasing than the others to see when 
there is some stationary text being displayed at the bottom of the screen. With 
"insert/delete line" the appropriate number of lines must be deleted and then 
inserted; the text at the bottom thus moves within the display's memory. Such 

Keyboards 
23 
jumps are often visible to the user. With "scroll window," the whole thing is 
performed as one operation and the lines at the bottom do not jump. 
"Memory Mapped" Displays 
This designation covers a wide range of displays. Their common character-
istic is that display memory can be read or written at near-bus speeds. The 
display is usually built into the computer that is running the text editor. Many 
personal computers and workstations follow this design. But be warned: some 
computers have very fast display hardware, but the software that is used to 
interact with the display is very slow. It is probably better for a redisplay 
scheme to consider such displays to be "advanced" or even "basic." Examples 
of such displays are the ROM BIOS calls on the IBM PC and Sun work-
stations. In both cases, third-party drivers operate many times faster than the 
manufacturer-supplied ones. 
The use of such fast displays has several implications for the redisplay 
process. First, many of the advanced features are typically not available. 
However, it may be possible to emulate the missing features quickly enough 
that the lack of advanced features is almost always not significant. Second, it 
may be possible to use the display memory as the only copy of the data on 
the screen. (This optimization is discussed in Chapter 7.) Third, if reading 
from the screen does not cause flicker but writing does, the screen can be read 
and the incremental redisplay process will run and compare the buffer against 
it, changing it only when necessary. Finally, if you can write to the screen 
without flicker, the redisplay process merely boils down to copying the buffer 
onto the screen, as copying is generally faster than comparing. 
Graphics Displays 
Most personal computer and workstation displays are actually bitmap-
oriented graphics displays. Software is used to make them appear to display 
characters. With a graphics display-and the appropriate software-a pro-
gram can not only display text, but display text using proportional spacing 
(where different letters take up different amounts of space), take advantage 
of different sizes, styles, and display fonts, and even incorporate graphical 
elements. 
Keyboards 
This section presents a review of salient keyboard features. Although most of 
us won't ever get the chance to design a keyboard, we all purchase keyboards, 
and more importantly we design programs with existing keyboards in mind. 
The keyboard is the main way of telling the computer what to do. In some 
cases, it is the only way of doing so. Many thousands of characters will be 

24 
2. User Interface Hardware 
entered in the course of a normal working session. Someone who types for a 
living (such as a typist, writer, or computer programmer) can easily type ten 
million characters each year. 
The keyboard should thus be tailored for the ease of typing characters. 
While this statement might seem trite, there are a large number of keyboards 
on the market (i.e., most) which are pretty poor for entering characters. Below 
is a discussion of the various keyboard features and why they are or are not 
desirable. 
N-KEY ROLL-OVER is a highly desirable feature. Having it means that 
you don't have to let go of one key before striking the next. The codes for the 
keys that you did strike will be sent out only once and in the proper order. 
(The n means that this roll-over operation will occur even though every key 
on the keyboard has been pressed before the first one is released.) The basic 
premise behind n-key roll-over is that you will not hit the same key twice in 
a row. Instead, you will hit a different key first and the reach for that key will 
naturally pull your finger off the initial one. N -key roll-over loosens the 
timing requirements regarding exactly when your finger has to come off the 
first key. Thus, typing errors are reduced. Note that n-key roll-over is of no 
help in typing double letters. Note also that shift keys are handled specially 
and are not subject to roll-over. 
Some keyboards implement "2-key roll-over/n-key lockout." This means 
that only the first two keys of a continuous sequence will be sent and the rest 
ignored (until all keys are released). This "feature" is actually a way of turning 
the statement "we don't offer n-key roll-over" into a positive-sounding state-
ment "we offer 2-key ... " 
AUTO-REPEAT means that if a key is pressed and held down, the code 
for that key is sent repeatedly. It is a very desirable feature. It can cause 
problems (say, if you put something down on the keyboard), but such prob-
lems are worth living with. Older terminals sometimes followed typewriter 
design in that only certain keys would repeat (such as space, 'x', and dash). 
Repeating just these few keys is not useful. Other terminals repeat the printing 
characters but not the control characters. This is also not useful. As we will 
see later, it is the control characters that we are most likely to want to repeat. 
There are three parameters associated with auto-repeat: the initial delay to 
the first repeat, the rate at which a key will repeat, and the acceleration of 
the repeat. Ideally, the user should be able to set these parameters. If they 
cannot be set, the values selected by the manufacturer become an additional 
consideration. 
"TYPEABILITY" (I trust that the English language has not sunk to the 
point where this is considered to be a valid word) is the single most critical 
feature. It is simply the ability to type the useful characters without moving 
your fingers from the standard touch-typing position (the "asdf" and "jkl;" 
keys). As more and more people who use (computer) keyboards are touch 
typists and can thus type reasonably fast, they should not be slowed down by 
having to move their hands out of the basic position. It can take one or two 

Keyboards 
25 
secm,ds to locate and type an out-of-the-way key. The row above the digits is 
out of the way, as are numeric key pads and cursor control keys. One second 
is from three to ten characters of time (at 30-100 words per minute). Thus, it 
takes less time in general to type a four- or five-character command from the 
basic keyboard than to type one "special" key. 
Because of the desire for typeability, it is worth at least considering doing 
away with such keys as Shift Lock or Caps Lock. They are rarely, if ever, used, 
and the keyboard space that they occupy is in high demand. (Yes, I realize 
that my anti-uppercase bias is showing here.) 
Keyboard manufacturers have done other things that reduce typeability. 
Two examples are illustrative. First, the timing on the shift keys can be blown. 
The result of doing so is that when "Foo" is desired, "FOo," "fOo," and "foo" 
are as likely to result. The other example is having a small "sweet spot" on 
each key. Missing this "sweet spot" will cause both the desired and the 
adjoining key to fire or not. Thus, striking "i" could cause either "io" or 
nothing to be sent. 
PACKAGING or physical keyboard design is also very important. Sharp 
edges near the keyboard or too tightly packed keys can cause errors and 
fatigue. Can the keyboard be positioned so as to be comfortable? Is there 
a palm ledge (this may be either good or bad)? Does the keyboard meet 
"ergonometric" standards? (In my experience, "ergonomic" standards equate 
to "hard to use.") 
Special Function Keys 
Keyboard manufacturers seem to have decided that a plethora of special keys 
is more useful than adding shift keys. Thus, you can get keyboards with Insert 
Line or "cursor up" or-gasp-PF1 (if not LF1, F1, and RF1). These keys, 
when pressed, will either do the function that they name, do something totally 
random, or send a (usually pre-defined and unchangeable) sequence of 
characters to the program. 
With the advent of windowing systems, manufacturers have realized that 
the keyboard/display combination simply does not have the information 
required to properly perform the function locally. They have also decided that 
random operations don't sell devices well. This is actually a change from the 
terminals made a few years ago. 
That leaves us with character sequences. Ideally, the sequences would be 
programmable. Thus, the editor could save the current set of programmed 
sequences (if any), load a set that would not interfere with any editing 
commands, then restore the user's settings upon exit. However, this is the real 
world and it is often the case that the sequences are not programmable. 
Given this, the keys mayor may not be useful. For example, the "cursor 
up" key might send Escape 'E'. You may wish this particular sequence to 
perform a "move to end of sentence" operation (I do). Thus, pressing the 
"cursor up" key will move you to the end of the sentence! 

26 
2. User Interface Hardware 
Okay, you say, I won't use Escape 'E' to move to the end of the sentence. 
You then look up all of the sequences that may be sent by function keys and 
design your command set around them. All is well and good until you try to 
use a different keyboard. Your new keyboard will in general use different 
sequences than the old one. The sequences may even conflict: for example, the 
"cursor down" key on the new terminal might send Escape 'E'. 
We got into this situation for two reasons: a major one and a minor one. 
The minor one is easy to deal with. All that we have to do is tell the editor 
which keyboard we are using and have the editor perform any required 
adjustments. On UNIX systems, for example, the required information can 
be found in the /etc/termcap or terminfo facilities. 
The major reason why we are in this situation is that the program cannot 
tell when we are pressing a function key and when we are typing the same 
sequence of characters explicitly. After all, there are only 128 or 256 possible 
characters, and they must be shared by regular keys and function keys. 
Some systems that support directly attached terminals use timing informa-
tion to make this determination. If a string of characters comes in with 
no delays between them, they assume (usually correctly) that it is a single 
function-key press. This timing approach does not work if the terminal (or 
other computer) is coming in via a network. 
The problem could best be solved by standardizing the character sequences 
sent by function keys so as to (1) have a single, obscure prefix (say, Escape, 
control-_) and (2) have a consistent syntax so that all devices can easily 
determine when the sequence is over. Command set designers would just have 
to live with the hole in the command set, but that would be a small price to 
pay. 
Aside from the problems of compatibility with whatever software is being 
run, the placement of the function keys is also a problem. As was mentioned 
before, keys that are off to one side take a long time to hit. Thus, typing is 
slowed down considerably. The keys are best used for infrequently used 
functions or functions where the extra time is not a significant factor (e.g., 
Help). 
There is yet one more problem. Additional keys are not free and so the 
number of them that you'll want to pay for is limited. However, it is desirable 
to have the ability to specify a large number of functions (i.e., have a large 
number of codes that can be specified by the user). The number of function 
keys required grows linearly with the number of codes. 
Extra Shift Keys 
The other way to increase the number of codes available to the user is to 
provide extra shift keys. Shift keys are keys that modify the actions of the 
other keys. Shift and Control are the two most common examples of such 
keys. The IBM PC has an Alt key, the Apple Macintosh has its "cloverleaf" 
key, and some terminals have a Meta key option. 

Keyboards 
27 
As an example, a Meta key would set the top (value 128 decimal) bit of the 
character that is typed. Thus, while typing shift-A would send the code for 
uppercase A (65 decimal), meta-shift-A (often abbreviated as simply meta-A 
or '" A) would send the code 128 + 65 or 193 decimal. A user can thus specify 
256 codes instead of the usual 128 from a full ASCII keyboard. 
The number of possible codes grows exponentially with the number of 
extra shift keys. Thus, 512, 1024, and even 2048 code keyboards (with 2,3, or 
4 extra shift keys) are conceivable. You will have to use system-dependent 
techniques to take advantage of this extra information. 
Finding room on the basic keyboard for these extra shift keys is not easy. 
That is one reason why the removal of the Shift Lock key was suggested 
earlier. These keys must be on the basic keyboard in order to preserve 
touch-typeability. 
Key Placement 
A computer is not a typewriter. There are things that you do with a computer 
that simply do not apply to typewriters. Hence, a computer keyboard should 
have more keys than a typewriter, and yet these keys must be conveniently 
placed. 
Several computer manufacturers have achieved good keyboard designs. 
Unfortunately, most of them have retired their good designs in favor of poor 
ones. (See the next section for examples.) Here are some of my criteria for 
good key placement: 
• Basic QWERTY keyboard (Dvorak keyboards are discussed later) 
• Top row has: Escape, 1/!, 2/@, 3/#, 4/$, 5/%, 6r, 7/&, 8/*, 9/(,0/), 
-/-, =/+ 
• Second row has: Tab, QWERTYUIOP, [I{,]/} 
• Third row has: Control, ASDFGHJKL, ;j:, r 
• Fourth row has: Shift, ZXCVBNM, ,/<,./), //?, Shift 
• Extra shift keys (Alt, Meta, etc.) should be immediately below the shift keys 
• The Back Space and/or Delete keys should be on the upper right, as close 
in as possible 
• The keys '/ '" and \/1 should fit into the right somewhere 
• The Return (Enter, etc.) key should be on the right, as close in as possible, 
in the third or second and third rows 
• The Break key should be on the far upper right 
These are the positions that have come to be accepted as standard for 
computer keyboards. However, some manufacturers have gotten scared that 
their computers might actually resemble computers. Thus, necessary keys 
such as Escape and Control get moved out to the far reaches of the keyboard, 
and "(" and ")" characters get moved from their convenient, traditional 
positions above "," and "." to who knows where. 
Dvorak keyboards are an underground fad. Their proponents swear by 

28 
2. User Interface Hardware 
them and claim significant performance improvements (i.e., you can type 
faster on them). As the story goes, the standard QWERTY layout was 
designed to slow typing on the early typewriters in order to keep the 
mechanism from jamming. And, since jamming is no longer a consideration, 
one can (and Dvorak did) design a layout that is "better." Regardless of 
the truth of the story (and I believe it to be true), all keyboard layouts can 
take advantage of the improvements in technology. For example, modern 
keyboards are actually a grid of switches. These switches are scanned elec-
tronically. Their travel, feel, and other characteristics can be adjusted as 
desired. They have been adjusted so that both key travel and effort are much 
reduced from old, manual typewriters. Hence, hand and finger motions are 
reduced overall and the benefits to be gained from switching layouts are 
thereby reduced. 
Considering that there are hundreds of millions of existing keyboards that 
use the QWERTY layout, and that there are billions of people trained to use 
it, it becomes clear that only an enormous gain in productivity (e.g., greater 
than 100%) would be able to justify a switch to another layout. And while 
there are a number of isolated success stories, not even the proponents of 
Dvorak layouts offer any controlled studies that show the requisite gains 
(Norman 1990). Hence, these keyboards are not being adopted on a large 
scale. 
Example Keyboards 
This section will briefly review a number of widely available keyboards. The 
keyboards reviewed are the ones actually named: the review does not transfer 
to "clones." The comments are, of course, my personal opinions. 
DEC VT100 terminal: The keyboard layout is excellent. The feel is klunky. 
The control keys don't repeat. 
DEC VT200 terminal: The keyboard layout is poor (badly placed Escape 
key and "(" and ")" keys). The feel is pretty good. 
IBM PC 83-key keyboard: This is the one sold with the original IBM Pc. 
Its layout is almost excellent (the "\"/"1" key placement is a little weird). It 
makes a clacking sound which I happen to like although many people do not. 
The feel is excellent. If only they didn't try to "improve" it with ... 
IBM PC lOl-key keyboard: This is the only one that you can get from IBM 
now, and it is enough in itself to keep me from buying a new IBM Pc. The 
Escape and control keys are very poorly placed. The feel is excellent. 
Apple Macintosh original "slab" keyboard: The layout isn't too bad you 
consider that Apple intended this machine to be its own universe, and not try 
to incorporate outside software. On the whole, however, it suffers from not 
having quite enough keys (especially Escape), so that terminal emulator 
programs are awkward to use. The feel is fair. 
Apple Macintosh "Standard" keyboard: Perfect layout, enough keys, great 
feel. 

Graphical Input 
29 
Apple Macintosh "Enhanced" keyboard: This keyboard is for people who 
like the IBM PC lOl-key keyboard. Enough said. 
SUD Microsystems SPARCstation keyboard: Excellent layout, poor feel, too 
many function keys. 
Graphical Input 
Another way of interacting with a computer is by means of a graphical input 
device. The advantage of a graphical input device is that it can reduce the 
number of commands needed. Such a device is used for pointing at sections 
of the screen. It is possible to specify items (i.e., "operate on that") without 
having to specify the numerical address of the location or a command string 
to move there. 
When a graphical input device is used, the screen is treated as one menu 
with the device pointing to one entry. A cursor is used to provide feedback to 
the user about which menu "item" is currently selected. There are usually one 
or more flags that can be specified conveniently from the device. These flags 
provide control information and are analogous to shift keys. 
The basic way to use these devices is to track the position implied by the 
graphical input device with the cursor. When a signal is given, the action 
implied by the current position is performed. The screen is logically broken 
up into two or more sections. One section has the text that is being edited. 
Moving the cursor here provides a convenient way to move the point around; 
typing a character could cause it to be inserted wherever the cursor is. Other 
portions of the screen can specify menus of possible actions to select from. 
Graphical input is thus a very sophisticated way of specifying a position as 
an argument to a function. 
The following sections discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a 
variety of graphical input devices. Bear in mind that the comments are 
generalizations: there are exceptions to each of the advantages and dis-
advantages mentioned. 
Touch Sensitive Display 
A Touch Sensitive Display (TSD) is just what it sounds like. The screen is 
covered with a special transparent material (or a grid of LEDs and receptors 
or other devices) that you touch with your finger: the absolute (x, y) coordi-
nates of where you touched are then reported. The only available flag is 
the "touch/no touch" flag. (Actually, experimental pressure-sensitive displays 
exist that report all three positions and three pressure axes.) The well-
engineered touch-sensitive displays are quite pleasant to use for low-usage 
applications. For high-usage purposes such as text editing, it is tiresome to 
keep raising your hand to the screen, and your finger tends to cover the most 
interesting part of the display (i.e., the part that you are about to edit). 

30 
2. User Interface Hardware 
Tablet 
A tablet is a special surface that reports the position of the input device as an 
(x, y) coordinate. The input device can be a "puck" (a small box) or a special 
pen. At least one flag ("touch/no touch") is always available: some pucks have 
four, sixteen or even more extra flags. Tablets are very handy for converting 
paper documents such as maps into computer form. They are less useful for 
text editing, as they tend to be large and therefore require a long reach and a 
lot of uncluttered desk space. 
Mouse 
A mouse is a small box on wheels (or, in some cases, on felt pads over a special 
pad). As you move it around on the floor, desk, books, a leg, or most anything 
else, it reports the relative movement of the mouse (e.g., "I was just moved n 
units up and m units left"). It can have several flags (buttons), although the 
correct number is one, as having extra buttons means that program designers 
will try to put extra functions on them. And, while the functions themselves 
are not a problem (I do advocate extra shift keys, after all), the presence of 
these functions usually implies a poor program design. Fortunately, if the 
mouse has extra buttons, the software can easily correct this "defect" just by 
making them all do the same thing. 
Trackball 
A trackball is an upside-down ("dead") mouse. Instead of moving the wheels 
by moving the box, you spin the slightly larger wheel directly. 
Joystick 
A joystick is a small stick mounted on a couple of potentiometers. They 
typically can report either absolute position, first derivative (relative move-
ment) or second derivative (acceleration). As the stick is moved only over a 
small distance, it is difficult to construct one with good resolution and that 
avoids "stickiness" and 'jumpiness." It is generally not as nice to use as a 
mouse or trackball. Flags are simulated by regular keyboard keys. 
A Different Mouse 
Finally, an imaginary but useful device should be considered. That device is 
a foot-operated mouse (perhaps called a "rat?"). Using your feet rather than 
your hand to operate the mouse solves one of the most nagging problems of 
any of these devices, which is that your hands must leave the keyboard with 
the usual, aforementioned results. Of course, this device makes it harder to 
edit with your feet up on your desk ... 

Communications Path Issues 
31 
Other Devices 
New types of input devices appear all the time. Thus, no listing of such devices 
can ever remain complete. An example of a recent such device is "pen" input. 
The points to remember are that each device should be judged on its own 
strengths and weaknesses and that the devices should be judged on how they 
help your users: not whether the devices are "neat" or "new." 
Conclusion 
These devices all assume a reasonably high bandwidth connection to the 
computer (say, 2400 bps or faster). If you have a slow-speed connection, the 
cursor tracking must be performed in the local display device, which must 
somehow be programmed with the knowledge of when to report events and 
what to do with the cursor (sometimes the cursor changes shape as it crosses 
from one part of the screen to another). In this way, it is possible to supply 
the necessary immediate feedback. A slow-speed connection would be quite 
satisfactory for communicating the significant events, but probably not satis-
factory for the screen refresh that would follow, say, the selection of a menu. 
Communications Path Issues 
This section covers a number of miscellaneous issues concerning the com-
munications path between the computer and the display/keyboard device. 
Speed and Character Format 
It almost goes without saying that the faster the communications path, the 
better. Consider it said. 
It also almost goes without saying that a full-duplex communications path 
is necessary. Fortunately, we are long past the days when users were forced to 
wait until the computer let them type. Except on automated teller machines. 
If the communications are over an asynchronous serial path, character 
format is an issue. The considerations are: 
• Seven or eight data bits? Pick eight if possible. In this way, you at least 
have the potential to use extra key codes. The choice of eight data bits also 
lets you use international character sets. 
• Even, odd, or no parity? Pick one to go with the data bits, as this field has 
no effect on the data that the editor sees. The combinations that you will 
tend to find all over the place are seven data bits and even parity (older 
systems) and eight data bits and no parity (newer systems). 
• Number of stop bits? One, unless your system wants a different number. 
Operating system designers make the quite valid and reasonable assump-
tion that they should be doing some processing of the input characters. 

32 
2. User Interface Hardware 
Fortunately, they usually also offer the ability to turn such processing off. A 
text editor should follow these steps: 
On entry to the editor: 
• Record the current processing parameters. 
• Turn off all character processing. 
On exit: 
• Restore the saved processing parameters. 
In this way, the text editor has complete control over what happens with 
the input characters. This places an extra burden on you as the writer of the 
editor, as you must replace the operating system handlers with versions of 
your own that mimic the existing functions. On the other hand, your versions 
will probably differ from the operating system versions in a number of crucial 
ways. For example, if the operating system lets you suspend your process (for 
example, under a Unix that supports job control), you need to restore the 
terminal and input processing parameters before you turn control back to the 
operating system. When resumed, you need to return the settings back to 
those used by the editor (noting any changes such as a new window size) and 
probably refresh the display. If you hadn't replaced the normal handlers, the 
user would find yours to be a very unfriendly program to use. 
Flow Control 
The faster the communications path, the less time the display has to process 
each character. As the speed of the communications path is increased, a point 
will be reached when the display can no longer keep up in real time. This is 
the point at which flow control is required. There are three methods currently 
in use to implement flow control. 
The first is in-band control. Two characters are reserved for flow control 
purposes, typically the control-S and the control-Q characters. The first is 
used to mean "hold on, I can't keep up and my buffer is almost full." The 
second means "okay, I've caught up and you can proceed." This method 
works for the most part, but has the annoying property of using up two 
valuable control characters. Using any control characters causes problems 
for some programs. For example, there exist some communications protocols 
that use all 256 characters and allow no characters to be reserved. 
The second method is out-of-band control. This method uses a variety of 
mechanisms, none of which interfere with sending data. Examples of such 
methods are hardware "handshake" lines and network protocol mechanisms. 
This method is clearly superior to in-band. 
The final method is flow control avoidance. This method takes advantage 
of the facts that displays take different amounts of time to process different 
characters and that some characters (called padding characters) take very 
little time to process. The program sends the data as a mix of useful characters 

Communications Path Issues 
33 
and padding characters. The specific mix is computed so that the average time 
required to process each character is less than the time taken to send a 
character over the communications path and that the terminal's input buffer 
does not overflow. 
For example, let's say that we have these (fairly typical) figures: 
• Communications path speed is one character per msec 
• Time to process a printing character is .6 msec 
• Time to process a line feed character is 17 msec 
• Time to process a pad character is .1 msec 
If we were just sending full lines of text to the display, we would send 
81 characters in 81 msec. These 81 characters would take 80 *.6 msec + 
17 msec = 65 msec to process. Hence, no padding would be required. 
On the other hand, if we were just sending single-character lines of text 
to the display, we would send 2 characters in 2 msec. These 2 characters 
would take 1 *.6 msec + 17 msec = 17.6 msec to process. Padding would 
be required as the 17.6 msec processing time is greater than the 2 msec 
transmission time. As it turns out, 18 padding characters will be sufficient 
(1 *.6 msec + 17 msec + 18 *.1 msec = 19.4 msec, which is less than the 20 
msec of transmission time). It is not difficult to calculate the correct number 
of padding characters required, given the character mix and the communi-
cations path speed. 
This third method is the preferred method for text editors, as it works on 
any communications path (i.e., even those with no out-of-band flow control) 
and it allows full use of all input characters. If used over a network, it has the 
disadvantage of creating a modest additional amount of network traffic. 
The ideal method would be for the editor to determine whether out-of-
band flow control is used along the entire communications path. If such 
control is in use, no padding characters need to be sent. Unfortunately, it is 
usually not possible to reliably determine the type of flow control in use. 
Echo Negotiation 
Echo negotiation was devised for the Multics computer system. It is a protocol 
for use by computer networks which can cut down on response time by 
reducing communications overhead. It is potentially useful in an environment 
where the user's terminal is at one node and the computer which is running 
the text editor is at another. In such an environment, it can take a long time 
to send a character back and forth, and yet it takes little more time to send 
many characters. 
Echo negotiation requires that it be easy to describe exactly what is to be 
done with each character to a communications processor/terminal com-
bination and that the combination be capable of doing enough of the editing 
to make it worthwhile. 
Typically, echo negotiation can only be used when the editing point 

34 
2. User Interface Hardware 
("cursor") is at the end of a line. The text editor sends a list of approved 
characters to the terminal or other nearby processor. As long as the user types 
only those characters and does not reach the end of a screen line (thus 
necessitating a wrap), the terminal can safely echo the input characters to the 
display and hold onto the input text. When any non-approved character is 
typed (or the line fills up), the terminal reports all of the held input characters 
and the reason why the input was sent on (i.e., non-approved character or line 
wrap) to the text editor. The editor then processes the input data and the cycle 
repeats. 
The Xylogics Annex terminal server incorporates an advanced version of 
echo negotiation called the LEAP Protocol. It incorporates all of the above 
design. 
Both standard echo negotiation and the LEAP protocol suffer from the 
same problem. This problem is severe enough to call into question the desir-
ability of using them at all. Echo negotiation is only potentially useful when 
the terminal is separate from the computer that is running the text editor and 
when the computer is overloaded. The principle behind echo negotiation is 
that waking up the text editor process for each character is inefficient. In 
extreme cases, the wake-up may take so long that input echoing is signifi-
cantly delayed. The fix that echo negotiation offers is to perform the updates 
in batches, thus waking up the text editor process fewer times and thereby 
reducing overhead. 
The problem with the fix is inherent in its own success. With no echo 
negotiation, input is echoed slowly but evenly (user typing is in general 
much slower than process-switching times) and the text-editing process tends 
to stay in memory. With echo negotiation, input is echoed quickly until 
the non-approved character is typed, then a (comparatively) long pause is 
encountered while the text-editing process must be woken up and possibly 
even swapped in (we are talking about a situation where resources are tight, 
after all). Even though the average per-character processing time might be 
lower, the variance in per-character times is much larger with echo negotia-
tion. It is usually the case that the variance is so high that the system as a 
whole becomes unpleasant if not impossible to use. In one extreme test that 
I performed, I found the variance of times to be so great that editing was all 
but impossible: until you stopped typing for many seconds, you could never 
tell whether the computer had processed all of your input and hence couldn't 
safely continue typing (editing commands-not new text to be inserted). In 
conclusion, echo negotiation is not a good feature to include. 
F ancy Modems 
High-speed modems (9600 bps and higher) are starting to become quite 
common. The main problem with them is that the advertising for them is 
focused around file-transfer protocols and dumping large quantities of text

through them. The manufacturers add a variety of compression techniques to 
improve their modems' throughput in these areas. 
However, text editing is interactive. Low response time is more important 
than high throughput. This is where the compression schemes implemented 
by the modems can cause problems. The simple solution is to turn off all such 
compression. Do not forget to turn off control-S / control-Q flow control 
while you're at it.

character. Why has this scheme dropped from favor? How does it interact

Implementation Languages 
He took his vorpal sword in hand: 
Long time the manxome foe he sought-
The choice of implementation language has a major effect on the design of a 
text editor. In some environments, only one language is available. In such 
environments, you do the best that you can and your editor may end up 
different from what it would be if the ideal language was available. However, 
most environments offer at least two languages. You thus have a choice, and 
this chapter offers guidance in making that choice. Of course, this may be a 
choice between Scylla and Charybdis ... 
General Considerations 
The general considerations in selecting a language to use for implementing a 
text editor are: 
• A vailability and implementation quality 
• Text handling power 
• Support for extensibility 
• Support for large projects 
• Efficiency 
Each of these considerations will be explored in detail. 
Availability and Implementation Quality 
You can only use those languages that are supported on the system that your 
text editor is first implemented upon. Nonetheless, you should be thinking 
about the second, third, and later systems that your text editor will be ported 
to, and which languages all of those systems support in common. 
In addition to the mere presence of a language processor on a system, you 
should take into consideration the quality of implementation of such systems. 
An implementation's speed of operation, quality of diagnostics, quality of 

General Considerations 
37 
code produced, and other such factors can make a large difference in the 
usability of the language on a particular system. 
Text Handling Power 
It may appear redundant to say that a text editor must handle text, but 
consider a spread sheet program: most of its work is in handling control flow, 
figuring redisplay, and setting up to execute commands. Only a small fraction 
of its time is spent in the floating point instructions that most users think is 
the program's "real work." 
At any given moment, a text editor-or most any other similar interactive 
program-is mainly doing all of the following: 
• Waiting for user input 
• Parsing that input 
• Setting up to execute the commands 
• Executing the commands 
• Determining the effect of those commands on the screen 
• Updating the screen 
Most of these operations involve processing text in some way or other. 
Text editors differ from other applications only in that the "executing the 
commands" item also involves manipulating text. 
It is important to note that "text handling" does not necessarily mean 
"string handling." In many cases, the language's native string operations are 
not sufficient, and you must write your own string primitives. For example: 
• Fortran does not support strings with dynamically varying lengths. 
• C does not support strings that contain the NUL (0 decimal) character. 
• Many implementations of Pascal do not support arbitrarily long strings 
(the leading byte count is often only 8 or 16 bits wide). 
Support for Extensibility 
If they do nothing else, text editors change. The language should make it easy 
to make and maintain changes. In some cases, the source code must be 
changed and the editor recompiled. However, it is very desirable to allow 
users to change some of the editor to suit their tastes. The language should 
offer such support. 
This support can take many forms: 
• Late binding of names to procedures through indirect calls, dynamic 
linking, or other techniques 
• Retaining and using the symbol table information at run time so that the 
user can think of changes in terms of names, not addresses 
• Internal error and consistency checking under program control so that 
users can be protected from their mistakes 

38 
3. Implementation Languages 
• The ability to add code to the executing editor 
Not all languages offer these features. You will have to simulate the missing 
features when using those languages that lack them. 
Large Project Support 
Text editors are apt to grow quite large. All of the techniques useful for any 
large project are useful here. Examples of these techniques are: 
• Division of the program into separate modules 
• Division of the program into separate files 
• Separate compilation 
• A way to organize the global name space 
• A way to keep objects out of the global name space 
• Automatic verification of procedure call/declaration compatibility 
• Conditional compilation 
• Compilation constants 
• A way of constructing "data abstractions" that package procedures and 
private state information 
• A way of dynamically allocating memory 
Add your own favorites to the list. 
Efficiency 
Programs spend most of their time doing simple operations such as: 
A=B 
A=B+/-1 
A=B+/-C 
No other expressions occur often enough to matter (Knuth 1971). Thus, the 
language should support these common operations well. Control structure 
implementations-in particular, a procedure call-should be kept efficient. 
Most languages do all right in this respect: the main thing is to ensure that 
they keep simple things simple. 
Specific Language Notes 
This section briefly examines a number of popular and/or interesting lan-
guage choices. It is important to keep in mind that at some level, all languages 
are equivalent: anything that you can do in one, you can do in any other, 
given sufficient CPU time, memory, and programmer elbow grease. However, 
each language is intended to make solving one type of problem easy, and in 
most cases that type of problem is not text editing. 

Specific Language Notes 
39 
TEeD 
TECO (Tape Editor and COrrector) was developed at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. It was one of the first text editors ever written. It grew 
over the years, gaining both popularity and features. During one of its more 
stable periods, Digital Equipment Corporation took a "snapshot" of its 
commands and produced (subset) versions for all of DEC's computers. 
But TECO kept growing. Along the way, it turned into a Turing-complete 
programming language. Several sets of editor macros were developed and 
used. Sometime around 1975, Richard Stallman organized these Editor 
MACroS into the first Emacs-type text editor. 
TECO is dearly a language capable of supporting text editing. However, 
unless you have a DEC SYSTEM 20 computer to run it on, you're out ofluck: 
M.I.T.'s version of TECO is written in assembly language and only runs on 
such systems. 
The TECO command set is described in Appendix D. There are two 
reasons why it is not a good choice as an implementation language: 
• As has been mentioned, its only implementation is on the PDP-lOjDEC 
20 series of computers. Implementations on other machines involve 
answering the question of what you write the TECO in-the very question 
that this chapter discusses. 
• It is the only language less readable than APL. A listing of a TECO 
program has a more than passing resemblance to transmission line noise. 
Writing and maintaining TECO programs is a definite problem. 
Lisp 
Lisp-especially Common Lisp-is an excellent choice. It is readily exten-
sible, as even compiled Lisp code usually has provisions for evaluating new 
expressions. It thus provides an interpretive language that can be readily used 
to write even complex editing macros. Modern implementations usually have 
excellent string support. The language has features such as macros and pack-
ages that support large projects well, and Lisp programs are fairly readable 
(if you don't mind lots of parentheses (like these (and these))). Compiled Lisp 
code is usually as efficient as that of any other language. 
Its view of memory management makes it well suited to the linked line form 
of buffer management (described in Chapter 7). 
c 
C was designed by people who wrote operating systems and utilities. Since 
text editors are among those utilities, it is not surprising that C would be a 
good choice. 
C supports extensibility as well as any other compiled language, and better 

40 
3. Implementation Languages 
than most. For example, it provides the ability to call procedures through a 
pointer. 
C lacks a built-in string type, but this lack is not a hindrance, as you would 
probably need to re-implement strings anyway. There is a strong tradition in 
C of creating new data types, so the requirement is well supported. 
C supports many of the features needed for large projects. In addition, as 
the language was designed by its users, and only came into widespread use 
after it was stable, there is a large existing base of compatible implementa-
tions. Due to this heritage, you don't need "improvements" in the language 
in order to get useful work done. 
C's basic data types are focused around characters, integers, and pointers. 
These are exactly the core data types needed by text editors. C allows the 
ready manipulation of complicated data structures and yet remains generally 
readable. 
C++ is a variant of C that provides much improved support for object-
oriented programming. It, too, is a good choice. 
PL/l 
PL/1 is another example of a "systems language." Thus, most of the com-
ments regarding C also apply to PL/l. However, its main failing is a lack of 
multiple implementations: the only vendor that seriously supports it is IBM 
Corp. 
Other Systems Languages 
There are a number of other systems languages (e.g., Modula). However, like 
PL/l, they have only a limited availability. Many were designed as research 
projects. None of them even distantly approach C in the number of imple-
mentations or trained programmers. 
Fortran 
Well, some people think that it's a great language for writing astronomy 
programs. I have even written a text editor in it. Not by choice. 
Pascal 
Many people consider this language to be a good alternative (read "better") 
to C. It is worth reviewing Pascal's history: it was originally intended as a 
language to present (relatively small) algorithms in an academic setting. It 
was also targeted to introductory programming courses. For those purposes 
it is an excellent choice. 
However, the standard language is not targeted towards developing large 
projects and does not provide the features that make developing a large 
project practical. On the other hand, each Pascal vendor has supplied those 

Specific Language Notes 
41 
features. Unfortunately, they have in general chosen different ways to provide 
the features, thus leading to incompatible implementations that make port-
ing code difficult. 
Basic 
Basic has Pascal's problems, only more so: the core version is not even 
standardized (by the industry: there is an ANSI standard which is honored in 
the breach). Implementations range from "Tiny Basic," which can be run in 
only a few Kilobytes of memory to "True Basic," as defined by Kemeny 
& Kurtz (Kemeny 1985), which offers all the advanced features that you 
could want and all but omits line numbers. But "True Basic" bears little 
resemblance to what most programmers think of as the Basic language. 
Ada 
Ada was designed as a language to support embedded, real-time systems. It 
has many features which allow compilers to validate code and use external 
information to produce small, reliable object modules. However, these fea-
tures do not mesh well with the need for extensiblity (for example, there is 
rarely a need to reprogram an altimeter while in flight). Further, the general 
computing environment that is the home for most text editors is simply 
outside the scope of what Ada is intended for. However, it should be seriously 
examined as a choice if the text editor is to execute in an embedded, real-time 
system. 
Sine 
Sine (Anderson 1979) was a Lisp-like language tailored for text applications. 
Its only implementation to date is on Interdata 7/32 (or Perkin-Elmer 3200) 
minicomputers running the MagicSix operating system developed at M.I.T.'s 
Architecture Machine Group. It is interesting because it is a language tailored 
for implementing editors. It is an example of an "ideal" implementation 
language. 
Sine is composed of two parts. Sine source code is assembled into a com-
pact format. This object code is then interpreted. It allows function rebinding 
and other such niceties. In addition, the interpreter implements such things 
as memory management and screen redisplay. Thus, the resulting editor is 
nicely structured, with "irrelevant" details hidden away. This mention of Sine 
leads nicely into ... 
Custom Editor Languages 
No traditional language (except perhaps for Common Lisp) offers complete 
support for text editing. The solution, used by virtually every implementation 

42 
3. Implementation Languages 
of Emacs-type text editors, as well as many implementations of other editors, 
is the creation of a custom editor language. 
An existing language-very often C-is selected. This language is used to 
write an interpreter for the custom editor language. The interpreter manages 
memory, handles display refresh, and in general provides all of the necessary 
utility functions. The editor language is then used to write the logic of all the 
user-visible commands. 
As the editor language is implemented using an interpreter, the command 
set is readily extensible. Also, because the editor language is designed around 
text editing, it can offer excellent text-handling power. 
The division of the programming tasks into two components provides an 
excellent base for supporting large projects. And, since the interpreter is 
usually implemented in a language such as C, the interpreter can be quite 
efficient. 
For these reasons, custom editor languages are the preferred method for 
implementing text editors.

Editing Models 
So rested he by the Tumtum tree, 
And stood a while in thought. 
An editing model is the view of the file that the editor presents to the user. 
This chapter describes several editing models. You can build other models by 
varying and combining these models. 
The following discussions review the models themselves, not the commands 
available to the user. You should assume that essentially the same commands 
are available in all models. 
One-Dimensional Array of Bytes 
The most general form of a data file is a one-dimensional array of bytes. The 
one-dimensional editing model presents this form of a data file directly to the 
user. In it, the bytes of the file are displayed uninterpreted for the user to see. 
The basic editing operations are "insert" and "delete bytes." 
This model is very pure, but it is a little difficult for most users to deal with. 
Text editors that appear to use this model actually use a slightly modified 
form ofthe model where some characters-in particular, the tab and newline 
characters-are interpreted during the display process. Thus, text files appear 
as a series of lines. 
In this model, line breaks mayor may not require special handling. Whether 
they do depends on how they are represented. Various representations are 
described in detail in the next chapter. 
This model supports both insertion and replacement editing equally well. 
Replacement editing is probably best implemented as a hybrid scheme where 
it automatically switches to insert mode to prevent replacing a line break. 
Two-Dimensional Array of Bytes 
This model is the basic two-dimensional form. Instead of editing a line, 
the user is editing in a quarter-plane, with the origin usually in the upper-
left corner. Conceptually, the user can move freely in the two-dimensional 

44 
4. Editing Models 
quadrant. In practice, the editor usually only stores the non-blank portions, 
as storing an infinite-quadrant's worth of data can be prohibitively expensive. 
Some systems may impose fixed upper bounds on the width or length of the 
quadrant. 
Line breaks are implicit in the editing model itself. Hence, implementations 
usually provide explicit commands to split and join lines. 
Both insertion and replacement editing are possible, although the model 
lends itself to replacement editing in a natural manner. Editors that use this 
model often have explicit commands to insert (and delete) both rows and 
characters within a row. 
While the pure form of this model arranges the text into a rectangle, most 
implementations actually impart a left-to-right, then top-to-bottom (or one 
of the other seven combinations) bias. This bias affects all of the editing 
operations. For example, it is often the case that implementations offer many 
commands for editing within a line, but only a few commands for editing 
entire lines. 
List of Lines 
This model is halfway between the first two. It consists of a one-dimensional 
array of lines. Each line is then a one-dimensional array of bytes. From the 
user's viewpoint, this model differs from the two-dimensional model in that 
text exists only where it has been entered. If the user wants to extend a line to 
the right, he or she must go into insert mode and type space characters. 
In the two-dimensional model, on the other hand, the quadrant is assumed 
to be filled with blanks. Hence, there is no concept of extending the line to the 
right, as the line is assumed to extend infinitely far. To add text to the right, 
the user simply moves to the desired position. 
Implementations that use this model usually make a very sharp distinction 
between editing within a line and editing lines. For example, lines may have 
a maximum length or cut and paste operations may only operate on line 
boundaries. 
Paged Models 
It once was popular to divide the text into a series of pages. Editing was 
performed within a page, and explicit commands were required to move to 
another page or to re-paginate the text. Any of the models could be used for 
editing within a page. This division was thought to be natural: not coin-
cidentally, it just "happened" to make it easier to write editors on systems that 
had very limited amounts of memory. 
Most modern editors show page breaks as a "framework" that "floats" over 
the underlying text. This framework can be placed over any of the other 
underlying editing models. 

Dealing with Real Text 
45 
Objects 
Editing is a very general concept: there is no reason to limit the basic objects 
being edited to characters (or bytes) and lines. It may make sense in some 
cases to provide ways of editing such objects as words, sentences, paragraphs, 
sections, chapters, and other "natural" objects as explicit objects. Most 
editors provide commands to manipulate these objects without having them 
affect the fundamental editing model. 
Other objects cannot be readily simulated. Examples of these objects are 
links to other documents, "opaque" objects included from other objects (e.g., 
bitmaps), and graphical objects (lines, boxes, circles, etc.). 
In addition, text can be viewed in more than two dimensions. For example, 
multiple files can be "stacked" into a third dimension, multiple versions of a 
single file can be combined into a time-like dimension, or portions of a file 
can be viewed and manipulated as a tree or list structure. The possibilities are 
endless. 
Dealing with Real Text 
The models just listed are more or less pure forms. Each model has its 
advantages and disadvantages because text has a more complex structure 
than is represented by any of the models. 
On the one hand, text is composed of a hierarchy of lexical units: 
• Characters 
• Words 
• Phrases 
• Sentences 
• Paragraphs 
• Subsections 
• Sections 
• Chapters 
• Documents 
These units reflect the meaning of the text. When the user is thinking 
in terms of meaning, the editor should provide an editing model-and 
commands-that reflect these units. Since text is read sequentially, the one-
dimensional model is well-matched to this mode. 
On the other hand, the printed page is composed of: 
• Characters, which are arranged into 
• Words, which are arranged into 
• Lines, which are arranged into 
• Pages, which are arranged into 
• Documents 

46 
4. Editing Models 
These units reflect the layout of the text. When the user is thinking in terms 
of appearance, the editor should provide an editing model-and commands 
-that reflect these units. As a page is a two-dimensional object, the two-di-
mensional model fits this mode well. 
Many "simple" editors and word processors support this mode of thinking. 
This mode is attractive for new users. After all, isn't the whole purpose of a 
word processor to put characters on a page? So doesn't it follow that users 
should be thinking in terms of placing each character on the page, one after 
the other? If taken to extreme, the user is forced to make every placement 
decision, a situation that doesn't leave the user with much time or energy left 
to decide what to write. 
While layout is important, it does not directly relate to the meaning of the 
text. And while meaning is important, the user sees the text in a particular 
layout, so layout-oriented editing is also important. The challenge, then, is to 
design an editing model-and an editor-that allows the user to select the 
most appropriate features of each model with minimal effort. Thus, it can take 
advantage of the best of both models while avoiding the disadvantages.

File Formats 
And, as in uffish thought he stood, 
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
This chapter surveys the range of file formats that a text editor might 
encounter. 
Text Files 
Each operating system has a standard way of storing text files. Text editors 
must be able to edit these standard system text files. From the user's point of 
view, such files consist of a series of reasonable-length lines of "reasonable" 
characters. 
Line Boundaries 
From the program's point of view, system text files consist of a sequence of 
characters, divided into lines in a variety of ways. Each of the most popular 
methods will be described. 
Card and Print Images: These files are a series of lines, all exactly the same 
length (typically 80, 132, or 133 characters long). They may also include 
another form of line divisor (e.g., 80 characters, then a CR/LF sequence). 
These files will mostly be found on older systems. 
Newline Character: Marker bytes are used to signal the end of one line and 
the start of another. Popular choices are: 
• Line Feed: Used by UNIX systems. 
• Carriage Return: Used by Apple computers and some DEC computers. 
• Carriage Return/Line Feed combination: Used by CP/M and MS/DOS 
computers. The two-character sequence can be awkward to use when 
editing. You can usually get away with dropping the CR (but only when 
it appears as part of a CR/LF sequence), use the LF as a newline character, 
and put the CR back when the file is written out. When editing an existing 

48 
5. File Formats 
file, record whether you found CRs to remove, so that you don't put extra 
CRs in when writing out binary files. 
Character Count: Some systems use an initial count of characters (typically 
the count is one or two bytes long), followed by that many characters. There 
mayor may not be padding between lines in order to align their start on a 
word boundary. 
Record Markers: Some operating systems store one line per record, and 
store the record markers "out of band." In this case, you must read and write 
one line at a time, and record the line break information somehow. (If the 
operating system lets you read multiple lines at once, it must have some 
method of indicating what the line boundaries are, which leads us to one of 
the earlier methods.) 
Line Contents 
Some systems place restrictions on the contents of each line. The most fre-
quently encountered restrictions are: 
Long Lines: Some systems have no limit on the length of a line. Others place 
a fixed limit. Typical limits are 80, 127 or 128, 255/6, 511/2, 32,767/8, and 
65,535 characters. If a program attempts to write lines that exceed the system 
limit, some systems return an error, others split the line, and still others will 
silently truncate the line. 
Short Lines: Most systems support zero-length (empty) lines quite well. 
However, some systems do not allow such lines while others allow them in 
theory but not in practice. For example, the system-supplied text editor may 
not allow the entry of empty lines. Because of this limitation, no files will be 
created that have such lines. Hence, the code to handle such lines may not be 
tested well, and some programs may not behave properly when such lines are 
encountered. 
Partial Last Line: This problem can only occur in systems that use a 
newline character. As with short lines, the system-supplied text editor may 
not allow the entry of partial last lines (i.e., a missing newline character) and 
some programs may not behave properly when such lines are encountered. 
Non-Printing Characters: All systems generally allow all printing char-
acters and the Space character to appear in text files. These characters have 
codes that range from 32 to 126 decimal in ASCII or the equivalent characters 
in EBCDIC. Difficulties arise in how programs handle other characters. For 
example, are Tab characters treated as one character or the appropriate 
number of spaces, and if the latter, what is the appropriate width? Limitations 
on non-printing characters usually fall into the following groups: 
• Tab 
• Form Feed 
• Back Space 
• Carriage Return (this is a "bare CR") 

Binary Files 
49 
• Other control characters (in the range 0 to 31 decimal and 127 decimal) 
• Meta characters (128 to 255 decimal) 
Typically, systems that allow a given group allow all preceding groups. 
Given that the characters are allowed, the next question is how should the 
character be displayed. Typical methods are: 
• Just send the character as is without translation. 
• Expand into caret notation (see Appendix E). 
• Expand into octal or hexadecimal notation. 
End of File 
Most systems record the exact file length and make this information available 
to the program. However, there are two special cases to be considered: 
CP/M systems only record the file length to the next multiple of 128 bytes. 
By convention, a control-Z (1\ Z) character is used to mark the end of the file. 
Data after the first Z character is ignored. Note that if the file ends exactly on 
a 128-byte boundary, some programs do not add the trailing 1\ Z character. 
Some programs filled the entire remainder of the block with the 1\ Z character: 
other programs relied on this convention and only removed trailing 
1\ Z 
characters. 
MS/DOS systems started off following the CP/M convention but later 
changed to omit the 
1\ Z character. The safest algorithm to use on these 
systems is: 
• If you are editing an existing file, record whether the file originally ended 
with I\Z. 
• When the new version is written, add a 1\ Z if the file had one. 
• Otherwise, do not add a 1\ Z. 
As always, the user should have a way of selecting both methods. 
Binary Files 
From a text editor's point of view, a binary file is any file that is not a text file. 
These files have none of the following restrictions found in text files: 
• Files may not be divided into lines at all. 
• Lines may be any length. 
• Lines may contain any character. 
As a general rule, it is a nice feature to be able to edit a binary file. The rules 
to be followed are these: 
• You should be able to read a file in and write the identical file back out. 
• It should be possible to move to and usefully view any portion of the file. 

50 
5. File Formats 
• It should be possible to insert any character. 
• It should be possible to precisely control any deletions (e.g., "delete the 
following three characters"). 
Structured Files 
If your editor will only encounter standard system-text files and binary files, 
you can skip the rest of this chapter which describes considerations for 
designing file formats for holding information in addition to pure ASCII text. 
Basic text files use 94 printing characters and a Space character. They also 
need some way to indicate line breaks. Often, users will want to include the 
Bell, Back Space, Tab, and Form Feed characters in their text files. Thus, a 
total of 99 characters are reserved for representing themselves. This leaves 29 
codes (with 7 bit characters) or 157 codes (with 8 bit characters) available for 
other uses. 
If all computer manufacturers used only the ASCII character set, the 
analysis could stop here. However, IBM Corp., Apple Computer Corp., 
Hewlett-Packard, and other vendors all support "extended" character sets 
that make use of many ofthese other codes. (Not to worry, though, the world 
is still safe: all ofthe manufacturers support different extended character sets.) 
What were previously unused codes are now in use to the extent that your 
users wish to be able to make use of the extended characters. 
(Actually, as this book is being written, many vendors are jointly develop-
ing a 16-bit character set called "UNICODE" that is intended to encompass 
most characters and glyphs in use. 
Where to Store the "Extra" Information 
Whether or not "extended" character sets are supported, it is likely that you 
will want to store more information than can fit into the unused character 
codes. This leads us to the basic choice that will affect many other aspects of 
the implementation: is the extra information stored in-band or out-of-band? 
In-Band 
Storing information in-band means that some of the character codes are used 
to signal the presence of this additional information. Once the presence of 
this information is indicated, all character codes can potentially be used to 
represent the information. 
The use of these character codes for non-character purposes has two rami-
fications. First, those codes are not available for representing characters. 
Second, if those characters are present, redisplay must know how to display 
them (and their associated information) and the user commands must know 
how to process them. 

The Additional Information 
51 
Depending upon the purpose of the extra information and your users' 
expectations, it may be appropriate to allow this in-band information to be 
visible to the user, at least in some display modes. Further, it may be approp-
riate to allow the user to edit the information directly. On the other hand, the 
best choice might be to hide this information from the user and allow only 
indirect manipulation. 
Note that programs should be able to parse in-band information in either 
direction (i.e., both when working forwards through the buffer and when 
working backwards). It is also important in this representation that it be 
reasonably easy to determine how to display a file when starting from an 
arbitrary point in the middle of the file. In particular, the program shouldn't 
have to examine the entire previous contents of the file in order to figure out 
how to display something. 
Out-of-Band 
Storing information out-oj-band means that none of the character codes are 
used for any special purpose. Rather, the additional information is stored 
somewhere else and is tied back to the text by means of pointers and offsets. 
The disadvantage of choosing the out-of-band method is that you must 
find some place to put the information. While a file is being edited, the 
information can (and probably should) be stored in special purpose structures 
within the editor. However, when the file is stored, th~ additional information 
must be put somewhere. This place can be a separate file or a separate part 
ofthe same file (either a different file "fork," or at the file's beginning or end). 
Conclusion 
There may be enough additional information that manipulating it can itself 
require significant overhead. The techniques described in the next chapter 
apply to the additional information as to the text itself. 
There is no preferred choice: both in-band and out-of-band have their good 
points and their bad. The choice must be made on a case-by-case basis. 
Actually, they are almost two ends of a continuous scale. The difference 
between them could also be considered like this: 
• In-band data is parsed at each use 
• Out-oj-band data is parsed at file load 
The Additional Information 
This section describes some of the categories of additional information that 
you may wish to store in files. These categories are illustrative examples only: 
you will probably want to store other types of information or the same types 
in different ways. 

52 
5. File Formats 
Fonts, Sizes, Attributes 
A font describes the shapes of the characters. Size information describes how 
large a character should be. Attributes are variations on a font such as 
boldface, italics, or underscoring. Together, these are used in word processors 
to provide character formatting. 
These three share common qualities such as the ability to change at a 
character boundary, and the ability to change one without changing the 
others. The representation that you select needs to take these qualities into 
account. 
Line, Paragraph, Page, and Other Formats 
This information determines such things as line margins, justification types, 
tab stops, page headings and footings, page length, and so forth. This infor-
mation has a major effect on the redisplay code described in Chapter 7. 
N on-Text Objects 
These can be arbitrary non-text objects such as graphical bitmaps or object, 
spread sheets, database excerpts, or other information used by non-editor 
applications. The editor needs to know such things as: 
• How to display them 
• How much space they occupy 
• How to invoke the application that define!> them 
• How to obtain current or updated versions of them 
Internationalization 
This section lists some of the U.s. and English language biases that might be 
encountered in text files. Techniques for removing these biases from the 
program are outside the scope of this book. By their nature, these biases are 
hard to sort out: my apologies if I have missed some. 
Except for this section, this book contains U.S. and English language 
biases. However, the programming and design techniques described in the 
rest of this book are applied in pretty much the same way in non-U.S. and 
non-English language editors. 
The first bias is the character set used to represent information. There are 
many different international character sets and, while they tend to incor-
porate the U.S. ASCII character set (presented in Appendix E) in them, they 
all differ in the other characters. 
The second bias is the character size (i.e., the number of bits required 
to represent the number of distinct characters that can be stored in the 
document). If you are limiting your users to ASCII, 7-bit characters are 

Questions to Probe Your Understanding 
53 
sufficient. However, international character sets may require 8, 16, or even 32 
bits per character. In the case of the larger character sizes, it may make sense 
to store most characters as 8-bit codes and to have multiple-byte characters 
for the others. So long as your implementation handles them consistently and 
can interchange data with the other programs on your system, the exact 
representation does not matter. 
The third bias is the language direction. English uses left-to-right, then 
top-to-bottom. Other languages use different patterns. You must also prop-
erly handle cases where you mix languages (say, English and Arabic). 
The fourth bias is the general conventions for handling such things as 
character case (some languages do not have English's upperjlowercase 
distinction), characters changing representation depending upon their posi-
tion within a word (contextual forms), and so forth. 
The fifth bias is in handling numbers. For example, in the U.S., numbers 
are written as "1,000.5". In Europe, they are written as "1.000,5". In addition, 
languages differ in the order that digits are entered (left to right vs. right to 
left) and the placement of the most significant digit. 
The sixth bias is in handling dates: day-month-year, month-day-
year, and year-month-day are all popular, as are differing punctuation 
characters between them. 
The seventh bias is in handling calendars. Gregorian and Julian are both 
in use and quite similar, but there are lunar and other calendars also in use. 
The eighth bias is how punctuation characters are handled. For example, 
in Spanish, questions are introduced with an inverted "?" character and 
terminated with "?". 
The last bias is how hyphenation is handled. In English, it is often difficult 
or impossible to determine how a word should be hyphenated. In Portuguese, 
on the other hand, it is very easy to determine how to hyphenate a word and 
is considered mandatory to handle hyphenation properly.

The Internal Sub-Editor 
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, 
And burbled as it came! 
There are many ways to decompose the implementation of a text editor into 
smaller pieces. This book analyzes one particular decomposition: that into a 
sub-editor to manage the text being edited, redisplay, and the user-oriented 
commands. (There are no other pieces: when these have been assembled, 
the editor is complete.) This particular decomposition was chosen for two 
reasons. First, it is a natural one with relatively simple interfaces between the 
parts. Second, it has been chosen for many different implementations: it is 
thus known to be a decomposition that works well. This chapter covers the 
internal sub-editor. The following chapters describe the other parts. 
The purpose of the internal sub-editor is to hide all of the details of how 
the text is stored from the redisplay and the user-oriented commands. This 
chapter will begin by presenting some basic concepts and definitions. It will 
then list internal data needs and describe a procedural interface. Finally, it 
will present a number of ways to implement the actual sub-editor and discuss 
the trade-offs between them. 
Basic Concepts and Definitions 
A buffer is the basic unit of text being edited. It can be any size, from zero 
characters to the largest item that can be manipulated on the computer 
system. This limit on size is usually set by such factors as address space, 
amount of real and/or virtual memory, and mass storage capacity. A buffer 
can exist by itself, or it can be associated with at most one file. When 
associated with a file, the buffer is a copy of the contents of the file at a specific 
time. A file, on the other hand, can be associated with any number of buffers, 
each one being a copy of that file's contents at the same or at different times. 
A write operation replaces the contents of a file with the contents of a buffer. 
Thus, the two have identical contents for at least one moment. A read opera-

Basic Concepts and Definitions 
55 
tion replaces the buffer with the contents of a file. Again, the two have 
identical contents for at least one moment. An insert operation adds the 
contents of the file to the buffer: the two will not have identical contents unless 
the buffer was empty just before the insertion. 
The buffer interface presented here follows the "one-dimensional array of 
characters" model as described in Chapter 5. As will be seen, however, the 
implementation need not follow that model. When stored as text in the buffer, 
line breaks will be represented by a single character, called newline. 
At anyone time there is one and only one special position within the buffer. 
This position is called the point. All operations that change the contents of 
the buffer occur at this position. There are also operations whose sole purpose 
is to move the point. The point can exist only between two characters: it is 
never on a character. On those displays that can only position a cursor on a 
character, the convention is to place the point at the left edge of the cursor. 
The start of the buffer (which corresponds to the first location in the file) 
is considered before or backward from the point. The end of the buffer is 
considered to be after or forward from the point. 
From time to time, it is useful to be able to remember positions within a 
buffer. A mark is an object that can remember a position. There can be any 
number of marks within a buffer, and more than one mark can remember the 
same position. As with the point, a mark is always located between two 
characters. 
When there is exactly one mark, the range of characters between the point 
and the mark is called the region. It does not matter which order the point 
and mark are in. 
Here are two examples of how marks are used: 
• A mark may remember a specific location for future reference. For 
example, a command might paginate a file. In this case, a mark would 
remember where the point was when the command was invoked. Thus, the 
point could be moved during the re-pagination and returned to its initial 
starting place. 
• A mark can serve as bounds for iteration. For example, the "fill para-
graph" command might place a mark at its starting place, move to the end 
of the paragraph and place a mark there, then move to the beginning of the 
paragraph. It then performs a "fill region" operation, filling from the point 
to the location of the second mark. 
There are two types of marks. They differ only in how they behave in the 
case that an insertion is made at the location of the mark. Normal marks move 
with the insertion. Thus, the newly inserted character will be just before the 
mark. Fixed marks remain in place: the newly inserted character will be just 
after the mark. An example of the difference is in the case where a command 
is to identify the characters that are inserted. The command merely needs to 
create both a fixed and a normal mark at the same place. After the insertion, 
the two marks will bracket the new characters. 

56 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
A mode is a set of alterations to the user-oriented command set. For 
example, "C mode" might alter the definitions of the word-, sentence-, and 
paragraph-oriented commands to apply to tokens, language statements, and 
block structure. Modes are described in more detail in Chapter 8. 
Finally, the term character denotes the basic unit of change within a buffer. 
While characters can be any size, they are most oft~n eight bits long. In such 
a case, the term byte may be used interchangeably with character. 
Internal Data Structures 
This section discusses the sub-editor's data structures. All of the sub-editor's 
state information is defined in this section. Thus, if your implementation 
retains this information across invocations, you can offer the user the ability 
to resume editing where he or she left off, thus reducing the amount of work 
required to edit a file. 
The other place where state information is kept is in the screen manager 
which is described in the following chapter. The screen manager is that part 
of the software which knows what was displayed on the user's screen. If that 
knowledge is not retained across invocations, the information displayed on 
the user's screen may change when the user exits and re-enters the editor. If 
that knowledge is retained, the information can be recreated exactly. 
All of the specifics of the data structures listed here are examples only. You 
will undoubtedly wish to change some or all of them. 
The world contains all of the buffers in use by the editor. It is a circular list 
of buffer descriptors and a variable that indicates which is the current buffer. 
In C syntax: 
struct { 
struct buffer *buffer _chain; 
struct buffer *currenLbuffer; 
} world; 
Each buffer descriptor has this internal information: 
struct buffer { 
struct buffer *nexLchain_entry; 
char buffer_name[8UFFERNAMEMAX]; 
location point; 
int cur_line; 
int num_chars; 
int num_lines; 
struct mark *mark_list; 
struct storage *contents; 
char file_name[FILENAMEMAX]; 
time file_time; 
FLAG is_modified; 
struct mode *mode_list; 
}; 

Internal Data Structures 
57 
Next-chain_entry is the mechanism used for implementing the circular list 
of buffers. The list is circular because there is no preferred (or "origin") buffer 
and it should be possible to get to any buffer with equal ease. 
Buffer_name is a character string that allows the user to be able to refer to 
the buffer. 
Point is the current location where editing operations are taking place. It 
is defined in terms of a private data type, since different implementations will 
usc; different representations. As it turns out, there is never a need for any code 
outside of the sub-editor to ever be aware of the representation of this data 
type. 
Cur _line is optional. If implemented, it provides a high-speed way to track 
the current line number. 
Num_chars is optional. If implemented, it provides a high-speed way to 
track the total number of characters in the buffer (its length). 
Num_lines is optional. If implemented, it provides a high-speed way to 
track the total number of lines in the buffer. 
Mark_list is the list of marks defined for this buffer. The mark structure is 
defined later. 
Contents indicates the actual buffer contents. As with the location data 
type, its specifics will vary with the implementation. 
File-name is the name of the file associated with the buffer, or the empty 
string if there is no associated file. 
File_time is the last time at which the contents of the file and buffer were 
identical (i.e., the time of the last read or write). On multi-process systems, this 
value can be used to determine whether the contents of the file have been 
changed by another process, and thus whether the copy being edited is in 
synchronization with the actual file. 
Is_modified indicates whether the buffer has been modified since it was last 
written out or read in. 
Mode_list is the list of modes in effect for the buffer. The mode structure is 
defined next. 
struet mark { 
struet mark 'next-mark; 
mark_name name; 
location where_it-is; 
FLAG is_fixed; 
}; 
This structure is a linked list and is repeated for every mark. The chain is 
not circular. It probably is a good idea to keep the list sorted in the order that 
the marks appear in the buffer. 
Next-mark is a pointer to the next mark in the chain. A NULL pointer 
indicates the end of the chain. 
Name is the name of the mark. This name is returned by the mark creation 
routine and provides a way for the user to refer to specific marks. If your 
implementation permits, you can just return a pointer to the mark structure 
instead of making up names. 

58 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
Where_it-is is the mark's location. 
Is_fixed indicates whether the mark is a fixed mark. 
struct mode { 
struct mode *nexLmode; 
char *mode_name; 
status (*add_proc) (); 
}; 
This structure is a linked list and is repeated for every mode that is in effect 
for the current buffer. The chain is not circular. While modes should be 
defined in such a way that it does not matter what order they are invoked in, 
it is probably not possible to meet this requirement in actual practice. Thus, 
this list must be kept sorted in invocation order. Modes are discussed in more 
detail in Chapter 8. 
Next-mode is a pointer to the next mode in the chain. A NULL pointer 
indicates the end of the chain. 
Mode_name, if non-NULL, is the name added to the list of names of modes 
in effect. This list is ordinarily displayed somewhere on the screen. Note that 
there should be a mechanism for defining modes that do not have displayed 
names. 
Add_proc is a pointer to a procedure to execute whenever the command 
set for this buffer needs to be created or re-created. The procedure should 
make all required modifications to the global command tables and return a 
success/fail status. 
Procedure Interface Definitions 
This section defines the interface provided by the sub-editor. The procedures 
will be described in terms of their logical function only, leaving out specific 
implementation details. An example of such a detail is a method of determin-
ing whether the operation succeeded. (The undefined type "status" will be 
used to indicate places where status information is especially desirable.) All 
data types mentioned (e.g., string) are intended to be generic, and no specific 
implementations are assumed. 
One question that is important to your implementation but not addressed 
in this definition is whether the caller or callee allocates the data structures. 
This chapter will assume that the callee allocates all data. 
The names are selected for their mnemonic value. Actual implementations 
may be forced to change them to conform to local limits. In addition, you may 
wish to add a unique prefix (such as "Buf" or "SE") to them all to prevent 
name conflicts. 
status World_lnit(void); 
status World_Fini(void); 
status World_Save(char *file_name); 
status World_Load(char *file_name); 

Procedure Interface Definitions 
59 
World_Init is the basic set-up-housekeeping call. It is called once, upon 
editor invocation. It should perform all required one-time initialization 
operations. No other sub-editor procedure except for World_Fini can be 
legally called unless World_Init returns a successful status. After this call, one 
empty buffer exists (perhaps called "scratch" or something similar). 
World_Fini terminates all sub-editor state information. Once called, 
World_Init must be called again before other sub-editor calls can be legally 
made. 
World_Save saves all editor state information in the specified file. 
World_Load loads all editor state information from the specified file. These 
two routines implement state-saving across editor invocations. The possi-
bility of retaining multiple saved environments is interesting but, while it has 
been implemented, is not a feature that receives much use. It is perhaps too 
difficult for users to keep track of multiple editing environments or users may 
prefer to be able to switch among tasks without having to perform a save and 
load. 
If you are creating a "stripped down" editor, the World_Save and World_ 
Load routines would not do anything. They can be put in as stubs if there is 
a reasonable possibility that the editor will be embellished later. 
status Buffer_Create(char *buffer_name); 
status Buffer _Clear( char *buffer-name); 
status Buffer _Delete(char *buffer _name); 
status Buffer _Set_Current( char *buffer _name) 
char *Buffer_SeLNext(void); 
status Buffer_SeLName(char *buffer_name); 
char *Buffer_GeLName(void); 
These routines all manipulate buffer objects. Their definitions assume that 
character string names are used to specify buffer objects. As with marks, 
pointers to buffer structures can also be used if your implementation permits. 
As with many other questions, it is an implementation choice as to whether 
the sub-editor retains a "current buffer" or whether a buffer is explicitly 
provided to all remaining sub-editor calls. This definition chooses the former; 
as buffer changes are performed only (comparatively) rarely, and hence it is 
probably helpful to the sub-editor to be able to cache the information relating 
to the current buffer. 
Note that most of these calls are not useful for single buffer implementa-
tions as might be found in very resource-limited environments (e.g., a toaster). 
Such implementations should only include the calls if there is a reasonable 
chance of expanding to a multiple buffer editor in the future. 
BuffeLCreate takes a name and creates an empty buffer with that name. 
Note that no two buffers may have the same name. 
BuffeLClear removes all characters and marks from the specified buffer. 
Buffer _Delete deletes the specified buffer. If the specified buffer is the 
current one, the next buffer in the chain becomes the current one. If no buffers 
are left, the initial "scratch" buffer is automatically re-created. 

60 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
Buffer-Set-Current sets the current buffer to the one specified. 
Buffer-Set-Next sets the current buffer to the next one in the chain, and it 
returns the name of the new buffer. This mechanism allows for iterating 
through all buffers looking for one which meets an arbitrary test. 
Buffer-Set-Name changes the name of the current buffer to that specified. 
Buffer-Get-Name returns the name of the current buffer. 
status Point-Set(location loc); 
status Point-Move(int count); 
location Point-Get(void); 
int Point-Get-Line(void); 
location Buffer _Start(void); 
location Buffer_End(void); 
Point-Set sets the point to the specified location. 
Point-Move moves the point forward (if count is positive) or backward (if 
negative) by abs( count) characters. 
Point-Get returns the current location. 
Point-Get-Line returns the number of the line that the point is on. Note 
that while characters are numbered starting from zero, lines are numbered 
starting from one. 
Buffer-Start returns the location of the start of the buffer. 
Buffer _End returns the location of the end of the buffer. 
int Compare_Locations(location loc1, location loc2); 
int Location_ To_Count(location loc); 
location Count-To_Location(int count); 
These are miscellaneous utility routines. 
Compare_Location returns 1 if location loel is after loc2, 0 if they are the 
same location, or -1 if loel is before loe2. 
Location_ To_Count accepts a location and returns the number of char-
acters between the location and the beginning of the buffer. The point's 
percentage position can be computed by: 
«float) Location_ To_Count(Point-Get()) • 1 00.) / «float) Get-Num_Chars()) 
Count-To_Location accepts a non-negative count and converts it to the 
corresponding location. You can set the point to a position specified by an 
absolute character count by: 
Point-Set(Count-To_Location (count) ); 
status Mark_Create(marLname 'name, FLAG is_fixed); 
void MarLDelete(mark_name name); 
status Mark_ To_Point(mark_name name); 
status Point-To_Mark(mark_name name); 
location Mark_Get(mark_name name); 
status Mark_Set(mark_name name, location loc); 
FLAG Is_Point-At-Mark(mark_name name); 
FLAG Is_Point-Before_Mark(mark_name name); 
FLAG Is_Point-Aher_Mark(mark_name name); 
status Swap_Point-And_Mark(mark_name name); 

Procedure Interface Definitions 
61 
These routines manage marks. They allow for creating both normal and 
fixed marks, deleting marks, and otherwise manipulating them. Except when 
creating them, there is no difference in usage with these routines between 
normal marks and fixed marks (although their behavior will differ). 
Mark_Create creates a new mark of the specified type and returns its name. 
The new mark is positioned at the point. 
Mark_Delete deletes the specified mark. 
Mark_ To_Point sets the location of the specified mark to the point. 
PoinL To_Mark sets the point to the location of the specified mark. 
Mark_Get returns the location for the mark. This is not actually used all 
that much, as the location value can change whenever any sub-editor call is 
made. 
Mark_Set moves the specified mark to the specified location. 
Is_PoinLALMark returns True if the point is at the specified mark. 
Is_PoinLBefore_Mark returns True if the point is before the specified 
mark. 
Is_PoinLAfter _Mark returns True if the point is after the specified mark. 
Swap_PoinLAnd_Mark swaps the locations of the point and the specified 
mark. 
With these definitions, the basic way of doing something over a region 
would be like this: 
status Do_Something_Over _Region (mark_name name) 
{ 
FLAG was_before = Is_PoinLBefore_Mark(name); 
mark_name saved; 
status stat = OK; 
/* ensure that the point is before the mark· / 
if (!was_before) Swap_PoinLAnd_Mark(name); 
/* remember where we started· / 
if (Mark_Create(&saved) ! = OK) { 
if (!was-before) Swap_PoinLAnd_Mark(name); 
return(NOT _OK); 
} 
/* loop until you get to the mark' / 
for (;!ls_PoinLALMark(name); PoinLMove(1» { 
if «do something)! = OK) { 
stat = NOT_OK; 
break; 
} 
/* all done, put the point back' / 
PoinL To_Mark(saved); 
Mark_Delete(saved); 
/* put the point and mark back where they started· / 
if (!was_before) Swap_PoinLAnd_Mark(name); 
retu rn (stat) ; 
} 

62 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
The way that this procedure records the initial positions of the point and 
mark (a flag and a saved mark) is a little confusing. Unfortunately, it is less 
confusing than the alternative of creating two saved marks. 
char GeLChar(void); 
void GeLString(char *string, int count); 
int GeLNum_Chars(void); 
int GeLNum_Lines(void); 
These routines return buffer-related information. 
Get-Char returns the character after the point. Its results are undefined if 
the point is at the end of the buffer. 
Get-String returns up to count characters starting from the point. It will 
return fewer than count characters if the end of the buffer is encountered. 
Get-Num_Chars returns the number of characters in the buffer (i.e., the 
length of the buffer). 
Get-Num_Lines returns the number of lines in the buffer. It is undefined 
whether or not one counts an incomplete last line. 
void GeLFile_Name(char 'file_name, int size); 
status SeLFile_Name(char *file_name); 
status Buffer_Write (void); 
status Buffer_Read (void); 
status Buffer_lnsert(char 'file_name); 
FLAG Is_File_Changed (void); 
void Set_Modified (FLAG is_modified); 
FLAG GeLModified(void); 
These routines provide file-related operations. 
Get-File_Name returns the file name that is currently associated with the 
current buffer. Size is the size of the buffer allocated for the returned file name. 
Set-FilLName sets the file name for the current buffer. 
BuffeL Write writes the buffer to the currently named file, making any 
required conversions between the internal and external representations. The 
modified flag is cleared and the file time is updated to the current time. 
Buffer _Read clears the buffer and reads the currently named file into the 
buffer, making any required conversions between the external and internal 
representations. The modified flag is cleared and the file time is updated to 
the current time. 
Buffer _Insert inserts the contents of the specified file into the buffer at the 
point, making any required conversions between the external and internal 
representations. The modified flag is set if the file was not empty. 
Is_File_Changed returns True if the file has been changed since it was last 
read or written. 
Set-Modified sets the state of the modified flag to the supplied value. It is 
most often used manually to clear the modification flag in the case where the 
user is sure that any changes should be discarded. This flag is set by any 
insertion, deletion, or other change to the buffer. 
Get-Modified returns the modification flag. 

Procedure Interface Definitions 
63 
status Mode_Append (char *mode_name. status (*add_proc) (). FLAG is_front); 
status Mode_Delete (char *mode_name); 
status Mode_lnvoke(void); 
These routines manage the multiple mode capability. 
Mode_Append appends a mode with the supplied name and add procedure 
to the mode list. If is-front is True, the new mode is added to the front of the 
mode list. Otherwise, it is added at the end. 
Mode_Delete removes the named mode from the mode list. 
Mode_Invoke invokes the "add" procedures on the mode list to create a 
command set. 
void InserLChar(char c); 
void InserLString (char *string); 
void Replace_Char(char c); 
void Replace_String (char *string); 
status Delete (int count); 
status Delete_Region (mark_name name); 
status Copy_Region (char *buffer_name. mark_name name); 
These routines manipulate the buffer. All of them set the modification flag. 
Insert-Char inserts one character at the point. The point is placed after the 
inserted character. 
Insert-String inserts a string of characters at the point. The point is placed 
after the string. 
Replace_Char replaces one character with another. This routine is logically 
equivalent to: 
InserLChar(c); 
Delete(1 ); 
but is potentially more efficient. If the point is at the end of the buffer, the 
routine simply does an insert. 
Replace_String replaces a string as if Replace_Char is called on each of its 
characters. 
Delete removes the specified number of characters from the buffer. The 
specified number of characters are removed after the point if count is positive 
or before the point if count negative. If the specified count extends beyond the 
start or end of the buffer, the excess is ignored. 
Delete_Region removes all characters between the point and the mark. 
Copy _Region copies all characters between the point and the mark to the 
specified buffer, inserting them at the point. The basic Emacs Wipe Region 
command is actually implemented as: 
Copy_Region (kill-buffer. mark); 
Delete_Region (mark); 
This example also shows that even though an implementation presents only 
a single buffer to the user, a multiple buffer implementation may actually be 
required.

status Fi nd_ FirsL I n_ Forward (char 'string); 
status Find_FirsLln_Backward(char 'string); 
status Find_FirsLNoLln_Forward (char 'string); 
status Find_FirsLNoLln_Backward (char 'string); 
These routines handle searching and matching strings. While it is possible 
to implement these routines in terms of routines that have already been 
defined, because of their repetitive nature, it helps performance if they are 
built into the sub-editor. (Actually, the same can be said of several of the other 
routines that have been defined such as InserLString.) 
Search_Forward searches forward for the first occurence of string after the 
point and, if found, leaves the point at the end of the found string. Successive 
searches will thus locate successive instances of the string. If not found, the 
point is not moved. Types of searches are discussed in Chapter 9. 
Search_Backward works like Search_Forward, except that the search pro-
ceeds backward and the point is placed at the start of the found string (i.e., 
the end closest to the start of the buffer). 
Is_A_Match returns True if the string matches the contents of the buffer 
starting at the point. In other words, it returns True if Search_Forward would 
move the point strlen(string) characters forward. 
Find_FirsLIn_Forward searches the buffer starting from the point for the 
first occurence of any character in the supplied string. Thus, Find_FirsLln_ 
Forward("0123456789") would leave the point before the first digit found after 
the point. Unlike the Search_ * routines, this routine leaves the point at the 
end of the buffer if no characters in the string are found. A typical use of the 
Find_ * routines is this sequence, which skips over the first number after the 
point: 
Find_FirsLln_Forward ("0123456789"); 
Find_FirsLNoLln_Forward ("0123456789"); 
Find_FirsLIn_Backward works in the obvious way. 
Find_FirsLNoLIn_Forward searches for the first occurence of any 
character not in the supplied string. Thus, Find_FirsLNoLln_Forward 
("0123456789") would leave the point before the first non-digit found after the 
point. Unlike the Search_ * routines, this routine leaves the point at the end 
of the buffer if no characters in the string are found. 
FinLFirsLNoLILBackward works in the obvious way. 
Here are some examples of using the Find_ * routines: 
To move to the start of the next line: 
Find_FirsLln_Forward (NEWLIN E);

To move to the start of the next word: 
Find_First-1 n_Forward (word_chars); 
Find_First-Not-ln_Forward (word_chars); 
int Get-Column (void); 
void Set-Column (int column, FLAG round); 
Get-Column returns the zero-origin column that the point is in, after 
taking into account tab stops, variable-width characters, and other special 
cases, but not taking into account the screen width. (After all, the width of the 
display that the user happens to be using should not affect the actions of an 
editing command.) 
Set-Column moves the point to the desired column, stopping at the end of 
a line if the line is not long enough. If the specified column cannot be reached 
exactly (due to tab stops or other special cases), it uses the round flag. If the 
flag is set, the point is "rounded" to the nearest available column position. If 
the flag is clear, the point is moved to the next highest available column 
position. 
Characteristics of Implementation Methods 
This section describes how implementation methods may be characterized, 
and then describes three of those methods in detail. All of those methods are 
assumed to store the buffers in the equivalent of main memory. Depending 
upon the physical characteristics of the computer, "main memory" can be 
actual memory, virtual memory, or readily mappable into virtual memory. 
A later section describes methods for dealing with files that do not fit into 
main memory. 
The implementation methods discussed here use two-level "divide and 
conquer" strategies. The first level divides the buffer into pieces. The size 
ranges for each piece are: 
• One character 
• A small number of characters (e.g., 16 to 64) 
• A line 
• A large number of characters (e.g., 512 to 4,096) 
• The entire buffer 
The pieces can be kept in an array, a linked list, or some other structure. 
The second level describes how the pieces are managed: 
• No management 
• Extra space at the end 
• Buffer gap 
Each of these second-level techniques will be described in detail.

6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
NoM anagement 
In this technique, the piece is allocated exactly enough memory to hold it. The 
length of the piece is the only "overhead" information. A deletion is done by 
allocating a new piece of the desired (smaller) size, then copying the non-
deleted portions from the old piece to the new one. An insertion is done by 
allocating a new piece of the desired (larger) size, then copying the old piece 
to the new one, inserting the new characters on the way. In code: 
struct piece { 
int length; 
char data [1 ]; 
/* length characters * / 
} 
/* delete LEN characters starting from START * / 
struct piece * Delete_From_Piece(struct piece *pptr, int start, 
int len) 
{ 
struct piece *newptr; 
int newlen = pptr-> length -len;

&pptr-> data [start + len],

newptr - > length = newlen; 
free (pptr); 
return (newptr); 
}

int newlen = pptr-> length + len; 
/* allocate new piece * / 
newptr = (struct piece *)malloc(sizeof(struct piece) + 
newlen -1); 
if (newptr == NULL) return (NULL); 
/* copy existing parts * / 
memmove (&newptr - > data [0], &pptr - > data [0], start); 
memmove(&newptr->data [start + len], &pptr->data [start], 
pptr- > length - start); 
newptr - > length = newlen; 
/* copy new part * / 
memmove (&newptr-> data [start], chrs, len); 

free (pptr); 
return (newptr); 
} 
Extra Space at the End 
Characteristics of Implementation Methods 
67 
In this technique, the piece is allocated enough memory to contain it, and 
possibly additional memory as well. The length of the piece and the amount 
of the piece currently in use are kept as overhead information. A deletion 
never requires a re-allocation. An insertion will require a re-allocation only 
when the free space is used up. As the bulk of insertions are one character at 
a time (i.e., as the user types), insertions will only require a re-allocation at 
relatively infrequent intervals. In code: 
struct piece { 
int length; 
int used; 
char data [1 ]; 
} 
/* length characters * / 
/* delete LEN characters starting from START * / 
struct piece * Delete_From_Piece (struct piece *pptr, int start, 
int len) 
{ 
memmove(&pptr- >data [start], &pptr-> data [start + len],

pptr - > used - = len; 
return (pptr); 
} 
/* insert LEN characters starting at START * / 
struct piece *lnsert_lnto_Piece(struct piece *pptr, int start, 
int len, char *chrs) 
{ 
struct piece *newptr; 
int newlen; 
int amt = min (pptr-> length - pptr-> used, len); 
/* do as much as will fit· / 
memmove (&pptr-> data [start + amt], &pptr->data[start], 
pptr->used -

memmove(&pptr->data[start], chrs, amt); 
pptr - > used + = amt; 
len -= amt; 
if (len <= 0) return (pptr); 
/* done */ 
start += amt 
chrs += amt; 
newlen = Round_Up_To_BlocLSize(pptr-> length + len); 
/* allocate new piece· / 
newptr = (struct piece *)malloc(sizeof(struct piece) + 
newlen - 1); 
if (newptr == NULL) return (NULL);

newptr - > length = newlen;

return (newptr); 
} 
When this version of the delete routine is compared to the "no manage-
ment" version, it is simpler and will run faster. The insert routine is more 
complex, but most of the complexity will be executed only rarely. The path 
most often followed is again simpler and faster than before. This technique 
has an additional benefit. In the "no management" version, memory is allo-
cated in character-size units ranging from one character to the entire piece. 
In the "extra space" technique, memory is allocated in (typically) sixteen byte 
chunks. Typical allocation units will range from eight bytes to the piece-size 
limit (if any), in steps of sixteen bytes. (Actually, you probably never want to 
allocate a piece that is not a multiple of sixteen bytes). In any event, the 
dynamic range of the size of allocated units will be much smaller than in the 
"no management" technique. Thus, memory management will consume less 
overhead, and less memory will be lost to allocation fragmentation. 
Buffer Gap 
The buffer gap technique system stores the text as two contiguous sequences 
of characters with a (possibly null) gap between them. Changes are made to 
the buffer by first moving the gap to the location to be changed and then 
inserting or deleting characters by changing pointers. It thus uses memory 
efficiently, as the gap can be kept small and so a very high percentage of 
memory can be devoted to actually storing text. The overhead information 
includes the length of the piece, the location of the start of the gap, and the 
location of the end of the gap. 
Here is an example buffer which contains the word "Minneapolis".

In this example, the buffer is 11 characters long and it contains no spaces. 
The blanks between the "0" and the "I" show where the gap is and do not 
indicate that the memory has spaces stored in it. The point is between the "n" 

Characteristics of Implementation Methods 
69 
and the "e" at location 4 and is labeled with a "P" in the bottom line (legal 
values for the point are the numbers from zero to the length of the buffer, 
11 in this case). There are also three different sets of numbers (coordinate 
systems) for referring to the contents of the buffer. 
First is the user coordinate system. It is displayed above the buffer. The 
values for it run from 0 to the length of the buffer (11). As you will note, the 
gap is "invisible" in this system. The coordinates label the positions between 
the characters and not the characters themselves. Thought of in this way, the 
arithmetic is easy. Thought of as labeling the characters, the arithmetic be-
comes fraught with special cases and ripe for fencepost errors. 
Second is the gap coordinate system. It is displayed immediately under the 
line. The values for it run from 0 to the amount of storage that is available 
and it, too, labels the positions between the characters. The internal arith-
metic of the buffer manager is done in this coordinate system. The start of the 
gap (labeled "GS" in the bottom line) is at position 8 and the end of the gap 
(labeled "GE") is at position 13. 
Conversion from the user coordinate system to the gap coordinate system 
is quite easy. If a location (in the user coordinate system) is before the start of 
the gap, the values are the same. If a location is after the start of the gap (not 
the end of the gap!), its corresponding location in the gap coordinate system 
is (Gap End - GapStart) + the location in the user coordinate system. It is 
a good idea to isolate this calculation either in a macro or a subroutine in 
order to enhance readability. Most routines (e.g., the search routines) will 
then use the user coordinate system even though those routines are essentially 
internal. 
The third coordinate system is the storage coordinate system. It is the 
bottom row of numbers in the diagram. It is the means whereby the under-
lying memory locations are referenced. It is labeled from X to X + the amount 
of memory that is available. The origin (the value of X) was chosen here to be 
30 to help distinguish between the various coordinate systems. Its absolute 
value makes no difference. Note that it labels the memory locations them-
selves and so caution must be taken to avoid fencepost errors. 
This technique has a very low overhead for examining the buffer. The user 
coordinate location is first converted to the gap coordinate system. The 
memory location is then looked up and its contents returned. Essentially, one 
comparison and a few additions are required. The purpose of the conversion 
is to make the gap invisible. Note that the contents of the buffer are not 
moved. However, there is further overhead associated with inserting or delet-
ing, since the gap may have to be moved so that it is at the point. There are 
three cases: 
• The gap is at the point already. No motion is necessary. 
• The gap is before the point. The gap must be moved to the point. The char-
acters after the gap but before the point must be moved before the insertion 
or deletion can take place. The quantity ConvertUserToGap(point)-

70 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
GapEnd characters must be moved. This quantity is numerically point -
GapStart. 
• The gap is after the point. The gap must be moved to the point. The 
characters after the point but before the gap must be moved before 
the insertion or deletion can take place. The quantity GapStart-
ConvertUserToGap(point) characters must be moved. This quantity is 
numerically GapStart - point. 
After the gap has been moved to the point, insertions or deletions are per-
formed by moving the GapStart pointer (or the Gap End pointer-it makes 
no difference). A deletion is a decrementing of the GapStart pointer. An 
insertion is an incrementing of the GapStart pointer followed by placing the 
inserted character in the memory location that was just incremented over. 
Note that after the first insertion or deletion the gap is already in the 
correct place. Thus, the insertions or deletions that follow can take place 
without moving the gap. Further, the point can be moved away and back 
again with no motion of the gap taking place. Thus, the gap is only moved 
when an insertion or deletion is about to take place and the last modification 
was at a different location. 
This scheme has a penalty associated with it. The gap does not move very 
often, but potentially very large amounts of text may have to be shuffied. If a 
modification is made at the end of a buffer and then one is made at the 
beginning, the entire contents of the buffer must be moved. (Note, on the 
other hand, that if a modification is made at the end of a buffer, the beginning 
is examined, and another modification is made at the end, then no motion 
takes place.) The key question that must be asked when considering this 
scheme is, when a modification is about to be made, how far has the point 
moved since the last modification? 
How far can the point be moved before the shuffiing delay becomes notice-
able? Assume that an interval of 1/10 second is noticeable and that the editor 
is running on a dedicated system. 
Assume 250 nanosecond, 16-bit wide memory. Assume also that ten 
memory cycles are required for every two bytes moved (load, store, and eight 
overhead cycles for instructions). Then, 80,000 bytes can be moved with ajust 
noticeable delay. 
Because of the locality principle and because most files that are edited are 
less than 80,000 bytes in size, it seems reasonable to conclude that the average 
distance moved will be less than 80,000 bytes and so the shuffiing delay will 
not be noticeable. Note that the size of the gap does not affect how long the 
shuffiing will take and so the gap should be as large as possible. 
Multiple Gaps and Why They Don't Work 
Assume that we were still uncomfortable with the shuffiing delay and a 
possible fix was put forth. This fix would have, say, ten different gaps spread 
throughout the buffer. What would the effects be? The idea behind this 

Implementation Method Overview 
71 
discussion is to help one understand the buffer gap system by seeing how 
changes to the scheme fail. 
First, the conversion from the user to the gap coordinate system would be 
more complex and take longer. Thus, some ground would be lost. However, 
this is a small loss on every memory reference in order to smooth out some 
large bumps, so it might still be a reasonable thing to do. 
Second, the average amount of shuffiing will go down, but not by anywhere 
near a factor of ten. Because of the locality principle, most shuffiing occurs 
over short distances and so cutting out the "long shots" will not have a large 
effect. 
Third, unless the writer is very careful, the gaps will tend to lump together 
into a smaller number of "larger" gaps. In other words, two or more gaps will 
meet with the GapEnd pointer for one gap the same as the GapStart pointer 
for the next gap. There is just as much overhead in referencing them, but 
the average amount of shuffling will increase (or, more precisely, not be 
decreased). 
On the whole, the extra complexity does not seem to return proportional 
benefits and so this scheme is not used. 
The Hidden Second Gap 
On some computers, for example the two-dimensional memory system used 
by Multics, a second gap at the end of the buffer is provided with almost no 
extra overhead. The key to this gain is that the buffer is not stored in a 
fixed-size place. Rather, the size of the memory (or address space, to be more 
precise) that is holding the buffer can also increase. 
The extra overhead is a check to see whether a modification is taking place 
at the end of the buffer. If so, the modification can be made directly with no 
motion of the gap. 
The second gap has a greater effect than one might think because a dis-
proportionately high percentage of modifications take place at the end of the 
buffer. This distortion is due to the fact that most documents, programs, etc., 
are written from beginning to end and so the new text is inserted (or changed) 
at the end of the buffer. 
The increased overhead due to the second gap method is low because the 
check for the end of the buffer is already there (in the system hardware). There 
is no problem of the gaps coalescing because one of them is pegged into place. 
The gains are not all that great, but neither are the costs and so it should be 
used where supported by the operating system. 
Implementation Method Overview 
We started by not internally managing the pieces at all. We then added some 
slack space at the end of each piece. We moved to the buffer gap technique, 
which allowed that slack space (now called a gap) to move within the piece. 

72 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
Finally, we reviewed an optimization of the butTer gap technique that in some 
cases added the slack space at the end again. 
This table presents a summary of the implementation methods. A "-" 
means that the combination makes no sense. An "=" means that the com-

Combination [1J is the standard butTer gap management method. Com-
bination [2J is the "linked line" management method. Combination [3J is the 
"paged butTer gap" management method. The following sections will describe 
each of these methods. Later sections will compare and contrast them. 
Buffer Gap 
This method was first used by TECO. This method treats the entire butTer as 
a single object. The butTer gap technique is used to handle insertions and 
deletions. It is simple and straightforward, easy to implement and easy to 
debug. As the text is contiguous, the butTer can be transferred to or from a file 
with just one or two system calls. It also translates easily to the modern world 
of workstations with large virtual address spaces. 
Linked Line 
This method came into common use for Emacs-type editors when they began 
to be implemented on top of Lisp environments. In this method, the butTer is 
stored as a doubly linked list of lines. The following information might be 
stored for each line: 
struct line { 
struct line 'next; 
struct line 'previous; 
struct piece 'theline; 
int version; 
struct marks 'mark_lists; 
}; 
/* optional' / 
/* optional' / 

Paged ButTer Gap 
73 
The next and previous fields implement the doubly-linked list. They point 
to the following and preceding lines, respectively. 
The line field is managed using one of the management techniques de-
scribed in the earlier characteristics of implementations section. Typically, the 
"leave space at the end" technique is used. 
The version field is optional. If implemented, it is for use by the redisplay 
code and will be discussed in Chapter 7. 
The mark_lists field is optional. If implemented, it records which marks are 
located on this line. 
A buffer location in this method is typically represented as a (line pointer, 
offset) pair. It follows from this representation that marks are always asso-
ciated with a line (think about it). Marks can thus be efficiently implemented 
by a per-line mark list. By doing so, less time is required to update the marks 
after insertions or deletions because only those that are on the affected line 
can possibly be changed. 
The operation of this method is straightforward. New lines, when created, 
are simply spliced into the list at the appropriate place. Note that no char-
acters are stored to indicate line breaks. If the new line is inserted into the 
middle of an existing line, some movement of the text on the end of the old 
line to the newly allocated line is all that is required. 
The line itself is typically stored by the "extra space at end" technique. 
However the buffer gap technique could also be used. Regardless of the 
technique used, it is important to ensure that no limits are placed on the 
length of a line. 
If your implementation includes automatic word wrap, do not split lines on 
"soft" new lines, because the overhead of shuffiing the line allocations while 
the user types will be large. Instead, use a buffer gap technique within a line 
and only split lines on hard newlines (i.e., paragraphs). 
Paged Buffer Gap 
In this method, the buffer is divided into "pages" of one to two Kilobytes each 
while the file is read in. Each page is then managed with the buffer gap 
technique. The pages are organized into an array or linked list. This method 
has two points in its favor: 
o 
Since each page is small, the gap need never be moved very far. 
o 
Since all pages are the same size, memory management is kept simple. 
These points are very important in resource-limited environments. For 
example, this method was used in the Mince text editor that initially ran on 
CP/M systems with 48 Kilobytes of memory and small floppy disks. That 
editor implemented a complete paged, virtual memory environment for its 
buffers. (The implementation included all of the then-current optimizations 

74 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
found in virtual memory operating systems.} The size of the buffer was limited 
only to the amount of available disk space. 
Since main memory was so limited (in some systems, only three or four 
pages could be kept in memory at once), the excess pages were swapped to 
disk. A descendant of the Mince editor called The FinalWord used the disk 
storage to even greater advantage: the control information was written to 
disk as well, thus allowing the complete editing state to be saved between 
invocations as well as being recoverable in the event of a system crash. 
Other Methods 
The other methods involve tracking small chunks of characters or even 
individual characters. While they are in principle do-able, their small object 
size serves to increase the amount of memory and CPU overhead, unfor-
tunately without offering any compensating advantages. Thus, they remain 
largely unused. 
Method Comparisons 
This section compares the three main methods in a variety of ways. 
Storage 
These comparisons are on a per-buffer basis. They also assume eight-bit 
characters. Our sample buffer will consist of 150, 60-character lines. 
A buffer gap implementation requires a fixed-size header (say, eight bytes) 
plus one byte per character of text. Total size is 9,008 bytes. 
A linked line implementation requires a fixed-size header (say, eight bytes), 
plus a fixed-size header per line (say, twelve bytes) plus one byte per char-
acter of text, plus on the average eight bytes of fragmentation per line. Total 
size is 8 + 150 * 12 + 9,000 - 150 (don't store newline characters) + 8 * 150 
= 11,858 bytes. 
A paged buffer gap implementation requires a fixed-size header (say, eight 
bytes), plus a fixed-size header per page (say, twelve bytes), plus the pages (say, 
two Kilobytes each). Total size is 8 + 12 * 5 + 2,048 * 5 = 10,308 bytes. 
The linked line method pays a large storage price because of its relatively 
high per-line overhead. In this example, the per-line overhead was about 33 
percent. 
The paged buffer gap method pays a large price in this example because of 
the mismatch between the page size and the buffer. If memory is tight, a 
smaller page size can be selected. However, the extra overhead is paid only 
once per buffer, since it occurs only at the end. 

Method Comparisons 
75 
Crash Recovery 
These comparisons assume that a recovery program is examining the core 
image of an edit session that was interrupted. In the buffer gap method, crash 
recovery is relatively easy and fail safe. In general, the start and end of the 
buffer can be found if a marker is left around the buffer (say, a string of sixteen 
strange (value 255) bytes) and the buffer is everything between them. The gap 
can be recovered and manually deleted by the user or, if it too is filled with a 
special marker, can be automatically deleted. In the linked line method, crash 
recovery is harder. Recovery is greatly aided by erasing freed memory. Basic-
ally, you perform the recovery by picking a block at random and examining 
it. If it can be parsed into a line header (i.e., the pointer values, etc., are 
reasonable), continue (a careful selection of header formats will help). Other-
wise, pick a different block. You can then follow the next and previous 
pointers and parse them. If this works three or four times in a row, you can 
be confident that you have a handle On the contents. If a header doesn't parse, 
it is because it is either a part of a line (either pick again at random or go back 
one chunk and try again) or a header that was being modified (in which case 
you are blocked from continuing down that end of the chain). In the latter 
case, go in the other direction as far as possible. You now have one half of the 
buffer. Repeat the random guess, but don't pick from memory that you have 
already identified as part of the buffer. You should get the other half of the 
buffer. Leave it to the user to put the two halves together again. If the freed 
blocks are not erased, the chance of finding a valid-looking header that points 
to erroneous data is very high. 
In the paged buffer gap method, crash recovery is easier than with linked 
line, but harder than with buffer gap. As with buffer gap, marker bytes can 
help you locate the buffer pages, and the gap can be recovered either manually 
or automatically. The pages are strung together just like lines were: it is just 
that there are fewer pages to work with.

6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
As might be expected, the buffer gap scheme is the most efficient, although 
you will occasionally encounter a comparatively long pause. The linked 
line scheme adds lots of overhead to the simple operations and cuts out 
the occasional comparatively long pauses. But you will often be hit badly if, 
for example, you insert in the middle of a 4,OOO-character line. The paged 
buffer gap method removes the pauses at the price of a moderate increase in 
complexity. 
Efficiency of Buffer/File I/O 
This section compares the way that the methods handle buffer/file I/O. 
The buffer gap method is extremely efficient. Reading a file into a buffer 
consists of these operations: 
• Determine the file's length. 
• Allocate enough memory to hold the file, plus some extra for growth. 
• Read the file in. 
On some systems, even this can actually be improved. For example, on 
many systems you can just map the file into the address space of your process. 
No actual data motion takes place until you modify one of the pages. At that 
time, the page is copied and the modifications are written to the new copy 
(this is sometimes called "copy-on-write"). Writing the file out can take two 
calls (one to cover the text in front of the gap and the other to cover the text 
after the gap). 
The linked line method has a very obvious but poor algorithm to read the 
file in. This code fragment illustrates the algorithm: 
if (fd = fopen(FILE. "r"» == NULL) { 
... error ... 
} 
while (fgets(buf. sizeof(buf). fd) != NULL) { 
if (!Allocate_Line(strlen(buf» { 
... error ... 
} 
Build_Line(buf); 
} 
fclose (fd); 
This algorithm has a system call (in the fgets) and allocation for every line 
in the buffer. An improved algorithm would read the whole file into memory 
(or at least read in large chunks), then allocate lines out of that memory. This 
improvement at least reduces switching between the system and program 
contexts. (A sufficiently good fgets implementation would effectively do this. 
Unfortunately, the libraries that come with many C compilers are not suffi-
ciently good ... ) 
The paged buffer gap method could be just as efficient at reading as the 
buffer gap method. It would operate by reading the entire file in as a block, 
then dividing that block up without moving any data. The first insert on each

page will cause a page split, though. Writing would have a worst case number 
of system calls equal to twice the number of pages in use. 
Efficiency of Searching 
This section compares the way that the three methods handle searching. 
If your implementation is such that the search time dominates the setup 
time, all three methods are equivalent. In the case where the setup time 
dominates the search time, the methods do perform differently, and that is the 
case that will be examined. 
This comparison assumes that the search routines are "built in" to the 
buffer management code for performance reasons. While they could call 
Get-Char for every character, doing so would probably not be very efficient. 
Given equivalent implementations of the actual search code, the main differ-
ence among the methods is the number of times that the inner search loop 
is called. In other words, it is the number of distinct pieces that must be 
searched. 
The buffer gap method calls the inner loop twice: once for the text in front 
of the gap and once for the text after the gap. While an implementation could 
move the gap so that the search routine only needs to be called once, doing 
so goes against the reason for having the gap in the first place. Keep in mind 
that searching happens a lot. For example, two searches are done whenever 
the "forward word" command is given. The whole point of the buffer gap 
method is to avoid moving the gap until it is necessary. An even worse way 
to go astray is to move the gap as you search. This replaces one large, efficient 
gap move with many smaller ones. We have already observed that even fairly 
large gap moves are not very noticeable, so "optimizing" them out is not a 
wise move. In conclusion, invoking the search loop twice is quite efficient. 
The linked line method invokes the inner search loop once for every line in 
the buffer. In our earlier example, this means that it would be invoked 150 
times. Wqat's worse, the linked line method does not store newline characters. 
Rather, they are implied by the line structure. Hence, whenever a newline 
character is in the search string, that character must be handled in a special 
manner. While some optimizations can (and should) be made (for example, 
searching for "x<newline)" means that you only have to look at the last 
character of each line), the code complexity required to make these optimiza-
tions adds its own performance penalty. 
The paged buffer gap method lies somewhere between the other two. In the 
earlier example, the search routine would have to be invoked ten times. This 
is not enough to incur a significant performance penalty, but it is one more 
reason not to use this method if buffer gap will work. 
Multiple Buffers 
This section compares the way that the methods handle multiple buffers. 
The buffer gap method offers no choice: the buffers must follow one another 

78 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
in memory (where else could they be?). This arrangement becomes bad when 
the total size of all buffers becomes large enough that an objectionable pause 
occurs when switching buffers. The arrangement can be improved by leaving 
extra "gaps" between buffers. 
The linked line method has two choices. First, all lines can be allocated out 
of a common pool. Thus, over time, the buffers tend to "intertwine" (i.e., the 
lines of one buffer are mixed in with the lines from other buffers in physical 
memory). This choice tends to maximize the density of text and thus makes 
the most efficient use of memory. (See also the discussion in the next section 
about paged environments.) The other choice is to allocate memory among 
buffers, then allocate all lines for a buffer from within each buffer's allocation. 
There must, of course, be some way to change the buffer allocations. 
The paged buffer gap method has the same two choices as linked line. 
Paged Virtual Memory 
This section compares the way that the methods perform in paged, virtual 
memory environments. It concentrates on the effects that occur when main 
memory is full and paging is going on ("tight memory"). 
Some operations, such as searching the entire buffer, require that the buffer 
be accessed sequentially. In situations where the entire buffer does not fit into 
memory, no management method can avoid some page swapping. That type 
of situation is not analyzed here. 
The buffer gap method generally works well in this environment. Its highly 
compact format allows for accessing large portions of the buffer with only a 
few pages in memory. Its sequential organization also implies that it has a 
very good locality of reference and so the nearby pages are heavily referenced 
and likely to be around. 
Its major problem is, as usual, the worst case situation of a large gap 
movement. In tight memory situations, moving the whole buffer implies that 
all of the buffer's pages must be swapped in and-most likely-swapped out 
again. Overall, the buffer gap method does as well as can be expected. The 
nearby portions of the buffer will tend to be in memory because of locality of 
reference, but distant portions may in general have to be paged in. 
The linked line method has many disadvantages and no real advantages in 
tight memory situations. First, if an intertwining multiple buffer scheme is 
used, over time the effective page size is reduced by a factor that tends to 
increase over time to equal the number of buffers. This reduction is due to the 
random nature of the buffer memory allocations, the fact that many lines tend 
to fit into one virtual memory page, and the consequence that over time a 
virtual memory page tends to hold lines from as many buffers as possible. 
However, when a given buffer is in use, the storage used by the other buffers 
is consuming memory. 
Even separating the buffer memory does not resolve this problem. When 
buffers get large, different parts ofthe same buffer may act in the same fashion 

Editing Extremely Large Files 
79 
as the separate buffers to decrease the effective page size. In extreme cases, a 
desired "target" line may be in memory, but in the process of following the 
linked list, the target line may be swapped out! 
Notwithstanding the above, this method does not pack data as tightly as 
the others. An earlier example showed that the overhead for the linked line 
method is about 33 percent. Thus, the page size is effectively reduced by 
25 percent. 
When all factors are combined, a typical linked line system is probably 
reducing its effective page size by about 50 percent. The result is that, for 
example, if a computer has one Megabyte of memory in 512, two Kilobyte 
pages, the linked line method would effectively treat this as 512 Kilobytes of 
memory (512, one Kilobyte pages). 
The paged buffer gap method is essentially the buffer gap method, modified 
to improve performance in tight memory situations. It removes the lengthy 
gap moves and consequently lowers the probability of thrashing. When de-
signing such a system, the buffer page size should be set to be the same 
as or a multiple of the virtual memory page size. Thus, in even the tightest 
memory situations an insert or delete of one character will only affect at 
most two pages of buffer memory. 
Conclusions 
Use the buffer gap method if at all possible. 
Only use the linked line method if you are implementing in an environment 
that likes to manipulate lists of small objects; for example, Lisp environments. 
Only use the paged buffer gap method if resources are tight. 
Editing Extremely Large Files 
This section examines techniques for editing extremely large files. 
The first type of extremely large file is those files that are so large that 
reasonable assumptions based on current workstation and mainframe archi-
tectures are no longer valid. Given the current generation of computing 
hardware, this starts happening around 512 Megabytes (ten years ago, I had 
set this number at 64 Megabytes). At that size, even simple operations such 
as a string search can take several minutes to run on a fast processor with the 
whole file in memory. 
Although there are one or two interesting hacks you can do to stay alive, 
life is simply not bearable when trying to edit such a large unstructured file. 
The alternative which large data base implementors have known about for 
years, is to structure the file. This alternative is palatable because an unstruc-
tured editor can still be used to edit the pieces of a structured file. The other 
reason why this limitation is not bothersome is that there aren't all that many 
such files to edit. (For example, the largest file on a computer system that I 

80 
6. The Internal Sub-Editor 
often use is only about 33 Megabytes.) The vast majority of files are much 
smaller. Gigantic files call for special tools. 
The other type of "extremely large" file is encountered on resource-limited 
systems. In these cases, files that would otherwise be handled easily can now 
cause the system to bog down. For example, in the first generation of micro-
processor systems, an extremely large file might have been 100 Kilobytes. 
There are several ways of dealing with such files. 
One way is to divide the file into chunks, each of which fits into memory. 
You read in the first chunk, edit it, write it out, read in the second chunk, and 
continue until you are done. While arbitrary editing can be done within a 
chunk, in general you cannot back up to a previous chunk without finishing 
the file and starting over. This method was used by the original TECO editor. 
Another way is to use a three-file system. As the user moves down in the 
file, the "from" file is read and a "to" file is written. When the user wants to 
back up, the "to" file is read and a "holding" file is written (the chunks will 
appear in reverse order in this file). When the user moves forward again, the 
"hold" file is read (backwards) until exhausted, then the "from" file is read 
from again. 
The best method to use if main memory is tight is paged buffer gap. If disk 
storage is also tight, serial chunking is best. 
Difference Files 
There is another type of buffer management that has been used to good 
advantage in several cases. It is called the difference file method. It works best 
when recording relatively few changes, and those changes are small when 
compared to the size of the buffer. In this method, the buffer is not kept in 
memory at all. Instead, only a list of differences between the buffer and the 
"original" file is kept. When information is being retrieved from the buffer, it 
is read from the file as needed and the differences applied. 
This method has much promise. For example, in many cases, a file will be 
read into a buffer, looked at by the user, and the buffer deleted. In this exam-
ple, the difference file method essentially acts as a file viewer. This is partic-
ularly encouraging when you realize that the larger a file is, the less likely it 
is to be dramatically changed. 
On the other hand, this method does not scale well. For example, I have 
been editing this chapter continuously for several hours. As it turns out, the 
current version bears little resemblance to the original. The best description 
of the changes is "throw out everything and insert X," where "X" is the entire 
chapter. I would expect most "reasonable" descriptions of this chapter to 
wind up being several times as large as the chapter itself. Hence, you now have 
to address the question of how to edit the description of the differences. Let's 
see, we can use buffer gap, linked line, or paged buffer gap ... 
In addition, this method does not work well in tight memory situations. As

I write this chapter, it occupies about 60 Kilobytes of the roughly 100 Kilo-
bytes of free RAM disk space on my lap-top computer. I simply don't have 
the room to store what amounts to both the "old" and "new" versions at once. 
But, one might argue, you don't have to store the "old" version as it appears 
on disk. Well, that's true, but the disk is sitting on the table by my side, not 
in the floppy drive. So how can it be read? 
In conclusion, this method works well when one is essentially viewing files. 
However, it breaks down badly as changes to the file accumulate. It can easily 
end up taking several times as much memory to track all the changes as to 
simply store the modified version. Finally, the changes can easily become so 
large that either a "real" buffer management method must be implemented to 
simply track the changes or "snapshot" files must be created so that changes 
can be tracked from a new base. Hence, why bother with the extra overhead?

Redisplay 
One, two! One, two! And through and through 
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! 
The previous chapter described a way of dividing the implementation into 
parts and covered one of those parts, the internal sub-editor. This chapter 
describes the redisplay part. 
This chapter will start by discussing the general constraints that affect 
redisplay. It will then describe the external interface and some of the internal 
interfaces used by redisplay (the "procedure interface" definitions). It goes on 
to discuss many of the considerations that affect implementations of the 
algorithms. Finally, it describes the redisplay algorithms. 
Constraints 
Redisplay, or incremental redisplay, to give it its full name, is that part of the 
implementation that is responsible for ensuring that all changes to the buffer 
are promptly reflected on the user's display. As is evident from the definition, 
there are two parts to redisplay's job. 
The first part is to ensure that all changes are indeed tracked. In the absence 
of the second part, this part would be quite easy. 
The second part of the job is to ensure that the changes are made 
"promptly." In this context, "promptly" means that the amount of clock time 
required to make the updates visible is minimized. Clock time is the combina-
tion of transmission time, CPU time, and disk access time that is perceived 
by the user as the delay from when a command has been entered to when the 
display has been updated. 
In general, the buffer's contents will change only a small amount during 
anyone command. The screen will thus only have to be changed by a small 
amount in order to reflect the changed buffer contents. Hence, the algorithms 
concentrate on incrementally redisplaying the buffer; the entire process is thus 
referred to as incremental redisplay. Fortunately, it turns out that in cases 

Constraints 
83 
where the buffer is changed drastically, the increment-oriented approach to 
redisplay works quite well and so there is no need for multiple algorithms. 
This discussion of incremental redisplay assumes a model of the system 
where the editing is done on a main processor which communicates with a 
display. If the main processor is the same as the display, the bandwidth of the 
CPU to display communications channel can be very high. However, the 
considerations remain unchanged: only the relative weights change. Incre-
mental redisplay is an optimization between CPU time, display-processing 
time, and communications-channel time, with a few memory considerations 
thrown in. 
The first major constraint is the speed of the communications channel. 
Typical speeds that are available are 300, 1200, 2400, and 9600 bps. Memory-
mapped and other built-in displays run at bus speeds: communications speed 
is essentially infinite. 
A typical video display has a 24 x 80 character screen. At 300 bps, it takes 
three seconds to reprint a line and over a minute to refresh the whole screen. 
At 1200 bps, less than one second is required to reprint a line and about 
sixteen seconds to refresh the screen. At 9600 bps, it will take one to two 
seconds to refresh the screen. The speed of the communication thus greatly 
affects the amount of optimization that is desired. At 300 bps, the user may 
notice even one extra transmitted character, while at 9600 bps, reprinting 
entire lines does not take an appreciable amount of time. One dimension of 
the optimization is thus clear: the importance of optimizing the number of 
characters sent increases in proportion to the slowness of the communication 
line. 
The second major constraint is the speed of the display device. It takes 
time for the display to handle each command, and this time can affect the 
choice of commands sent to the display. For example, if a line ending in: 
whale 
was changed to: 
narwhale 
the redisplay code could elect to position the cursor just before the "w", insert 
three characters, then send "nar". Alternatively, it could position to the same 
place and just send "narwhale". The latter would be more efficient unless the 
display could accept and perform the "insert three characters" command in 
less than five character times (possible). As has been mentioned before, some 
memory-mapped displays actually process commands very slowly. As the 
effective display speed is so low, it is important to use good redisplay algo-
rithms on those displays. 
User interface considerations also affect which command sequences should 
be sent. For example, while it might be acceptable from a pure clock-time 
point of view to reprint an entire line, users do not like to see text which has 
not changed in the buffer "change" by being reprinted. The flickering that is 

84 
7. Redisplay 
generated by the reprinting process attracts the user's attention to that text, 
which is undesirable as the text has not, after all, changed. Thus, avoiding 
extraneous flickering and movement of text is good. The amount of perceived 
flicker will vary from display to display, being highly dependent upon such 
factors as display command set, display speed, internal display data-structures, 
timing, and phosphor. 
The third major constraint is the CPU speed. On some computers, comput-
ing an optimal redisplay sequence takes longer than is saved by the optimiza-
tions ("optimal" considering only the communications channel and display). 
On those machines, the correct optimization is to send the "less-than-
optimal" sequence. 
CPU time must be spent in order to perform any optimizations. If the CPU 
time spent exceeds some small amount of clock time, the user will perceive 
response to be sluggish. It is therefore desirable to minimize the CPU time 
spent on optimizing the redisplay. However, the communications channel 
speed also makes a difference. If the line is slow, extra CPU time can and 
should be spent (at 300 bps, it is worthwhile to spend up to 30 msec. of CPU 
time to eliminate one character from being transmitted (which takes about 30 
msec.». However, at higher speeds it is generally not practical to heavily 
optimize the number of characters sent, as it can easily take longer to com-
pute the optimizations than to transmit the extra data. This relaxation of the 
optimization is subject to the user interface constraint outlined above. 
The fourth constraint is the memory size. For example, one technique 
stores a copy of the entire screen, character by character. This technique 
works quite well in general. However, where memory is tight this technique 
may not be feasible. 
Procedure Interface Definitions 
This section describes two interfaces. The first one is the (external) interface 
that redisplay presents to the rest of the editor implementation (i.e., the 
sub-editor and the user-oriented commands). The second interface is the 
internal interface used by the redisplay to isolate the display-specific portions 
of its internal code. 
In this section, the term display refers to the hardware operated by the user. 
A display has a keyboard, screen, and perhaps a graphical input device. The 
screen is the part of the display that shows output. A window is a logical 
screen. One window can occupy the entire screen, or more than one window 
can share the screen, perhaps even overlapping. A window can never be larger 
than the screen. 
Editor Procedures 
status Window_lnit(char "display); 
status Window_Fini (void); 

status Window_Save(FILE *fptr); 
status Window_Load(FILE *fptr); 
Procedure Interface Definitions 
85 
Window_Init is the basic set-up-housekeeping call. It is called once, upon 
editor invocation. It should perform all required one-time initialization, in-
cluding keyboard and screen initialization. No other editor interface call 
except for Window_Fini can be legally called unless Window_Init returns a 
successful status. The parameter indicates the display type. Presumably, if the 
parameter is null, the routine will determine a default display. 
Window_Fini terminates all state information. Once called, Window_Init 
must be called again before other editor interface calls can be legally made. 
Window_Save saves the current redisplay state information in the file 
opened on the specified file descriptor. Presumably, World_Save opened the 
file, then called this routine. 
Window_Load loads all redisplay state information from the file opened on 
the specified file descriptor. 
If you are creating a "stripped down" editor, then these routines would not 
do anything. They can be put in as stubs if there is a reasonable possibility 
that the editor will be embellished later. 
void Redisplay(void); 
void Recenter(void); 
void Refresh_Screen (void); 
Redisplay performs one incremental redisplay. If it runs to completion, the 
screen will accurately reflect the buffer. However, this routine also checks for 
type ahead. If the user does type (or use the graphical input device) before the 
redisplay has finished, this routine will notice that event and abort the re-
display in a safe manner. Presumably, the user will quit typing ahead at some 
point and redisplay can then complete. 
Recenter operates as does Redisplay, except that it moves the point to the 
center of the window (technically, the preferred percentage). This procedure 
is needed because there is typically a user-level command to perform this 
operation. 
Refresh_Screen operates as does Recenter, except that it assumes that the 
screen has been corrupted. Thus, this routine ensures that the screen is correct 
no matter what else may have happened. 
void SeLPreLPct(int percent); 
int GeLPoinLRow(void); 
int GeLPoinLCol(void); 
SeLPreLPct sets the preferred percentage. After a Recenter or other simi-
lar operation, the point will be on a line approximately this percentage of the 
way through the window. A good default value is about forty percent. With 
this default on a 22-line window, the point will be on line 9. 
GeLPoinLRow returns the number of the row within the window that the 
point is at. 

86 
7. Redisplay 
GeLPoinLCol returns the number of the column within the window that 
the point is at. This may not be the same as the column returned by GeL 
Column, as that routine does not take into account line wrap. 
window_data Window_Create (window_data wind); 
status Window_Destroy (window_data wind); 
status Window_Grow (window_data wind, int amt); 
int GeLWindow_ Top_Line (window_data wind); 
int GeLWindow_BoLLine(window_data wind); 
location GeLWindow_ Top (window_data wind); 
location GeLWindow_Bot(window_data wind); 
These routines are used to manipulate multiple windows, if you choose to 
offer that feature. The definitions provided here only allow for horizontal 
windows (i.e., all windows occupy the full width of the display). Vertical 
windows and overlapping windows are not covered, although they are often 
implemented. 
Window_Create creates a new window. It operates by splitting the supplied 
window in two. Both windows initially show the same data. It returns a 
window descriptor for the second window. 
Window_Destroy destroys the supplied window. The window above this 
one expands to occupy the vacant screen space. Note that Window_ 
Destroy(Window_Create(wind» results in no change. 
Window_Grow grows the specified window by the specified number of 
lines. The window is grown by moving the top line up. 
GeL Window_ Top_Line returns the screen line that contains the top line 
of the specified window. 
GeL Window_BoLLine returns the screen line one after the bottom of the 
specified window. This is the same value as GeLWindow_Top_Line of the 
next lower window. 
GeL Window_Top returns the location in the buffer just before the char-
acter that is at the top left part in the window. Several of the user commands 
use this information. 
GeL Window_Bot returns the location in the buffer just after the character 
that is at the bottom right part ofthe window (or as close as you can get to 
it). This is the same location that would be returned by GeL Window_Top if 
the window were exactly one window below its current position. Several of 
the user commands use this information. 
Display Independent Procedures 
This section describes the display functions used by redisplay. The routines 
that implement these functions are not part of redisplay itself. A full discus-
sion of this topic is beyond the scope of this book (but is covered in Linhart 
1980). In essence, the problem is that every display manufacturer has decided 
on a different set of features and offers different ways of accessing those 
features. To solve the problem, a set of routines is needed which can isolate 

Procedure Interface Definitions 
87 
these differences, as well as a way of selecting among different sets of such 
routines as the display changes. 
Although not recommended, it is possible to cover a lot of displays by 
assuming that the display accepts the ANSI escape sequences (i.e., the display 
is a DEC VT100). Most modem displays accept these sequences. However, 
many older displays do not. In addition, not all displays take the same 
amount of time to process a given command. Thus, there is still per-display 
information to consider. 
There is one piece of existing technology to mention, and that is exemplified 
by the curses package available on many UNIX systems (similar packages are 
available under other names for other systems). It not only provides display 
independent functions, albeit with a somewhat different interface, it also 
performs the redisplay for you! However, as the purpose of this chapter is to 
explain how redisplay works, that package will receive no further mention. 
The following set of procedures will allow display-independent operations 
for most displays. The procedure interfaces isolate the operations that are 
used by redisplay. 
status Key_lnit(char 'display); 
status Key_Fini (void); 
char Key_Get(void); 
FLAG Key_ls_lnput(void); 
private Key _ Fu nction_ Keys (void); 
Key_Init and Key_Fini operate in the by now familiar fashion. They will be 
called by the Window_Init and Window_Fini routines. In particular, though, 
these routines make sure that all processing of input characters is turned off 
(i.e., set it for "raw" input) and all configuration information is loaded. 
Key_Get waits for a key to be pressed and returns it. Keys that send 
multiple characters (e.g., function keys) are returned one character at a time. 
Key_Is_Input returns True if input is available or False ifit is not. It is used, 
for example, by Redisplay to determine whether to abort. 
Key_Function_Keys returns information about the function keys available 
on this keyboard. This information includes key placement, key labelling, 
and the codes returned by the keys. The information is returned in an imple-

status Screen_lnit(char 'screen); 
status Screen_Fini (void); 
int Screen_Rows (void);

private Screen_Atrributes (void); 
Screen_Init and Screen_Fini operate in the by now familiar fashion. They, 
too will be called by the Window_Init and Window_Fini routines. In partic-
ular, though, these routines make sure that all processing of output characters 
is turned off (i.e., set it for "raw" output) and all configuration information is 
loaded.

Screen_Rows returns the number of rows in the screen. In this case, a row 
is the granularity of screen output. On a graphics screen, a row would be one 
pixel. 
Screen_Columns returns the number of columns in the screen. In this case, 
a column is the granularity of screen output. On a graphics screen, a column 
would be one pixel. 
Screen_Attributes returns information about the attributes (e.g., boldface, 
reverse video, blinking, etc.) that the screen supports. The information is 
returned in an implementation-defined manner (i.e., you get to invent your 
own representation again).

Set-Cursor sets the cursor to the specified row and column. It is assumed 
that the optimal (i.e., least cost) command sequence will be selected. 
Set-Row sets the cursor to the specified row, without affecting the column. 
Instead of a separate routine, this could be multiplexed onto Set-Cursor, say 
by one of the following: 
Set-Cursor(row, -1); 
Set-Cursor(row, Get_Column (»; 
Set-Column sets the cursor to the specified column without affecting the 
row. The functionality provided by this routine could also be multiplexed 
onto Set-Cursor. 
Set-Attr sets the current attributes to those specified. 
Get-Row returns the row that the cursor is on. 
Get-Column returns the column that the cursor is on. 
Get-Attr returns the current attributes. 
Put-Char outputs the supplied character to the screen, updating the cursor 
position. The character is always displayed: it is never part or all of a com-
mand sequence. 
Put-String outputs the supplied string and leaves the cursor after the 
string. It otherwise works as per Put-Char. These strings are always dis-
played, even if they appear to contain screen commands. Commands may be 
sent to the screen only by means of the supplied procedures. 
Beep rings the screen's bell or flashes the screen.

Procedure Interface Definitions

CLEOL sends the command sequence that optimally clears from the cur-
rent cursor position to the end of the current line. The cursor does not move. 
Clear _Line sends the command sequence that optimally clears the entire 
current line, and leaves the cursor in column 0 (you are assuming a zero-
origin on all of these numbers, aren't you?). 
CLEOS sends the command sequence that optimally clears from the cur-
rent cursor position to the end of the screen. Lines after the current one are 
completely cleared. The cursor does not move. 
Clear_Screen sends the command sequence that optimally clears the entire 
screen, and leaves the cursor at the upper-left corner (row 0, column 0). 
void I nserLString (char 'str); 
void Delete_Chars (int count); 
void InserLLines(int count); 
void Delete_Lines (int count); 
void ScrolLLines(int from, int to, int count); 
These commands are available on advanced displays only (by the definition 
of an advanced display from Chapter 2), and each is assumed to send the 
optimal command sequences to effect its purpose. 
Insert-String takes a string, determines the optimal command sequence 
required to insert it, and inserts it starting at the current cursor location. Line 
wrap is not performed: excess characters are dropped off the right edge of the 
screen. This routine could have been defined to accept a count instead of 
a string and to insert blanks. However, it is easier to optimize command 
sequences by having the string to be inserted available. 
Delete_Chars accepts a count and deletes that many columns. Line wrap 
is not performed. Blank columns are inserted from the right edge of the 
screen. 
Insert-Lines accepts a count and inserts that number of blank lines, start-
ing with the line that the cursor is on (thus, you can insert lines at the very 
top of the screen). 
Delete_Lines accepts a count and deletes that number oflines, starting with 
the line that the cursor is on (thus, the line at the very top of the screen can 
be deleted). Blank lines are scrolled in from the bottom. 
ScrolLLines accepts a from line, a to line, and a count. The lines starting 
with the from line, and up to but not including the to line, are scrolled by count 
lines (positive scrolls the lines up and negative scrolls the lines down). 
private Screen_ Timings (private goal); 
Screen_Timings accepts a description of a goal, and returns timing infor-
mation on the various choices of screen routines that could be used to achieve 
that result. The description takes into account the current screen status. The 
information is to help the redisplay code select the best screen routine, not to 
help the screen routines optimize their own performance (such optimizations 
are assumed to be done anyway). As with the other private data types, the 
information is returned in an implementation-defined manner (i.e., you get to

invent your own representation). Note that the two private data types in this 
procedure's definition (that for goal and the procedure itself) refer to different 
data types with different representations. 
Considerations 
This section describes various considerations that go into the redisplay algo-
rithm. In other words, these are the ways in which the algorithm gets compli-
cated. While none of these ways are particularly difficult to implement in 
themselves, collectively they would clutter the redisplay algorithms pre-
sented later. Hence, you should keep these topics in mind when reviewing the 
algorithms. 
The topics in this section are only vaguely related to each other and are in 
no particular order. 
Status Line 
In general, each buffer will have some lines of status information. In addition, 
there may be general editor status information. Finally, there may be lines of 
separators between windows. (One hopes that on "small" screens (i.e., those 
with less than, say, fifty lines), the numbers for these are "one," "none," and 
"none: use the buffer status line as a window separator" in order to devote as 
many lines as possible to showing the text being edited.) 
In any event, this "framework" information must be retained and dis-
played. The user-oriented command routines and redisplay must work to-
gether to provide this infrastructure. 
Here are some sample types of per-buffer status information: 
• the file name 
• the buffer name (may be the same as the file name) 
• the buffer status: unmodified, modified, read-only 
• the current modes 
• the point position in characters and/or buffer length 
• the point position as a percentage 
• the location of the top of the window as a percentage (or "top", "bot", or 
"all" as appropriate) 
• the point column 
• the current attribute 
• the current line and number of lines 
Of course, anyone editor implementation will only show some of this 
information at a time. This list is not definitive. 
Here are some sample types of editor status information: 
• the name and version number of the editor 
• copyright information 

Considerations 
91 
• the current date and time 
• the current system "load average," or other system information 
Again, anyone implementation may only show some of this information, and 
this list is not definitive. 
End of the Buffer 
There are two cases that must be handled. 
First, if the entire buffer fits in the window, you will run out of buffer before 
you run out of window. The caveat here is to ensure that this case is properly 
detected and that the entire buffer is shown, with the start of the buffer at the 
upper-left corner. 
Second, if the entire buffer does not fit in the window but the end of the 
buffer appears, the end should be close to but not at the bottom of the 
window. 
Those portions of the window that follow the end of the buffer can be left 
blank or marked in some fashion. As a rule, Emacs-type editors leave that 
part of the window blank. 
Horizontal Scrolling 
A window has a finite width. Some lines will not fit within that width. There 
are two popular ways of handling such a situation: horizontal scrolling and 
line wrap. Ideally, your editor should offer the user a choice between them. 
This section will describe the first. 
When performing horizontal scrolling, a line longer than the window width 
will spill off the edge: the part of the line that does not fit thus will not be 
visible to the user. As the user types, the text being displayed will adjust so 
that the text around the point is always visible. In addition, the user should 
be provided with commands to move the window left or right (with a few 
characters of overlap). In addition, the status line should contain indicators 
that show whether text is currently lost off of either the left or the right sides 
(use separate indicators). 
Line Wrap 
When performing line wrap, the window never moves left or right at all. 
Instead, the text that would have been clipped off of the right edge of the 
window is wrapped to the next line. If the line is sufficiently long, it may wrap 
two or more times. 
In this type of display, no window motion commands are required. In 
addition, the status indicators are also not required, although you may wish 
to mark the wrapped lines. 
Line wrap introduces a new problem that must be handled properly: that 

92 
7. Redisplay 
of single lines that, when wrapped, occupy the entire window. Although rare, 
such lines do show up from time to time in non-text files. 
When horizontal scrolling and line wrap are compared, neither comes out 
a clear winner and both offer valuable features, hence the assertion that your 
implementation should support both line wrap and horizontal scrolling. 
The advantages to horizontal scrolling are that it is easy to implement, and 
can be processed quickly. 
One of the disadvantages is that it requires a fast display. Consider the case 
when the user has a 160-column line displayed in an 80-column window. On 
the average, the window will have to be shifted twice per line of typing. 
Another disadvantage is that clipped text appears to have been deleted. It can 
be rather disconcerting to the user to have this text vanish and reappear. 
One of the advantages of line wrap is that all of the text is always visible. 
In addition, when editing a very long line, the entire window shows the 
immediate context. In contrast, when editing the end of a long line when using 
horizontal scrolling, most or all of the remainder of the window will be blank, 
having been scrolled off the left edge. 
The main disadvantages to line wrap are the additional complexity in the 
redisplay required to handle the line wrap, the very poor presentation when 
lines are only slightly wider than the window, and the disconcerting multi-line 
"shifting" that occurs when a user is inserting or deleting near the start of a 
wrapped line. 
Word Wrap 
Once you have line wrap, the next logical step is to break the line on a word 
boundary instead of a character boundary. You then offer "word wrap," a 
feature found in almost every word processor available today. Typically, a 
word processor will store each paragraph of text as a single line and simply 
perform word wrap upon it. Ruler lines are used to adjust the margins and 
change the type of justification. 
This is a very nice feature to offer. It does have some pitfalls for the unwary 
implementor, however: 
• Your redisplay now has to handle look-ahead. 
• You are going to have to decide where to break the lines (white space only, 
include dashes, include other punctuation?). 
• Your users are going to want ruler lines, and so you must provide all of 
that infrastructure. 
• You will have to track where the word wrap actually occurs because the 
user thinks (and hence the line-manipulating commands operate) in terms 
of the lines as displayed. 
If you do implement word wrap, you may as well go the whole way and 
support flushing right, centering, and justification of text during display. You 
can also implement word wrap in the user-oriented commands. 

Considerations 
93 
Tabs 
Tab characters can be handled in two ways. The first way is to not handle 
them at all. Instead, convert them to spaces upon entry. In this case, the 
redisplay code never sees those characters and hence doesn't need to deal with 
them. 
The second-and by far the most common method-is to treat the tab as 
a "cursor control command" that in effect says "think of me as n blanks, where 
n is the number of units to the next tab stop." Thus, when the redisplay code 
encounters a tab, it computes n, then pretends that it is displaying n consecu-
tive blanks (or a single blank of width n). N can be computed in one of three 
ways. 
First, tab stops can be set every c columns (or characters). In a zero-origin 
numbering system, tabs set every c columns are set at columns 0, C, 2*C, 3*C, 
... For example, when c is 8, tabs are in columns 0, 8, 16, 24, ... The C 
language expression to compute n is: 
n=c-x%c; 
where x is the current column. 
The second way to set tab stops is to allow them to be set at arbitrary 
column positions. This way is often used in ruler lines in simple word proces-
sors. In this case, you must decide on a representation such as a bit array or 
an array of the columns where tabs are set. 
The third way to set tab stops is to allow them to be set at arbitrary 
positions, where the positions are measured in units such as inches, milli-
meters, etc. This way is most useful on graphics screens. 
So far, only "traditional" tabs have been described. These might be termed 
"left" tabs because the left edge of the text is placed at the tab stop. Other types 
of tabs have become popular (again) with the advent of word processors: 
• Right tabs adjust the position of the text to the left of the tab stop so that 
its right edge is at the tab stop. Typically, all text back to the previous tab 
stop or the start of line is adjusted. 
• Decimal tabs search for a decimal point (comma in Europe) and place that 
character at the tab stop. Again, typically, all text back to the previous tab 
stop or the start of line is adjusted. These tabs act as right tabs if the text 
does not contain a decimal point. 
• Centering tabs center the preceding text between the current and previous 
tab stop. 
Again, other variations are possible. Note that only the (traditional) left 
tabs can be implemented without some sort of look ahead. 
Control Characters 
Control characters are those that are not printing characters, a space, a 
newline, or a tab. ("Printing characters" means just that: if your system 

94 
7. Redisplay 
supported "extended" or "enhanced" character sets, then those characters 
may not count as control characters.) In addition, a word processor may store 
some information "in band." That information would be either interpreted or 
skipped on redisplay. 
However, even in a word processor or on a system with an extended 
character set, there should be a way to view (and edit) a "pure" binary file. In 
order to view such a file, there must be a standard representation for non-
printing characters. 
One representation is to show such characters in octal ("\x###") or 
hexadecimal ("\x # # "). 
However, the most common representation-and possibly the most useful 
one-is to show such characters in caret notation (for a complete list of the 
caret notation, see Appendix E). The easiest way to define this notation is with 
a code excerpt: 
void Caret (char c) 
{ 
if (c == NL) { 
... handle newlines ... 
return; 
} 
if (c == TAB) { 
... handle tabs ... 
return; 
} 
if (c & Ox80){ 
PuLChar(' ~ '); 
c &= Ox7f; 
} 
if (c < SP II c > '~') { 
PULChar(,A '); 
c A ='@' 
} 
PuLChar(c); 
} 
When handling these multiple-character characters, your implementation 
must be consistent. For example, be sure that your cursor-positioning code 
takes the extra characters into account. Your implementation must also 
properly handle the case where such a character spans a line boundary. It 
doesn't matter which choice is made here (i.e., the choice is between splitting 
the character at the boundary and moving the whole character to the next 
line), only that your implementation handle it consistently and correctly. 
Proportionally Spaced Text 
Once you have tabs and control characters down, displaying text in a propor-
tionally spaced font is not too difficult. The main variation is that you no 
longer assume that all printing characters are the same width. Instead, you 

Considerations 
95 
look up the width of each one as you display it. Actually, you can even 
support kerning by looking up each consecutive pair of characters to decide 
how to handle them. 
The main "gotcha" in supporting proportionally spaced text is that one 
character no longer always exactly overwrites another on the screen. Thus, if 
you change an "m" to an "i", you have to figure out what to do with the extra 
width. Fortunately most displays that handle proportionally spaced text 
(mainly graphics displays) offer a high-performance primitive to scroll a 
region of the screen. 
Attributes, F ants, and Scripts 
The next level of generality is the support of attributes, fonts, and scripts. 
Attributes include such modifiers as boldface, italics, underscoring, and super-
scripting. Fonts include the different typefaces such as Times Roman and 
Helvetica. Scripts include language families such as European and Japanese. 
With these, your support can be as complex as you wish. Especially when 
it comes to scripts, your time and energy are going to give out long before 
you can provide support for all languages. 
However, each one is fairly simple to handle. The first step is to store the 
attribute, font, and script information somewhere (see Chapter 5). The second 
step is to interpret that information. 
Breaking Out Between Lines 
As was mentioned in the procedure interface definitions, the redisplay process 
does not have to run to completion before editing resumes. Instead, it can get 
to a convenient spot and check for any user input. If input has arrived, the 
redisplay can be aborted ("broken out of") and the input processed. It is 
important to keep in mind that the purpose of redisplay is to provide feed-
back to the user. If the user has already typed something, there is no imme-
diate need for the feedback. Hence, redisplay can be broken out of and then 
restarted after the user's input has been processed. 
In order to keep the amount of state information to a minimum, it may 
make sense to not abort instantly, but instead to finish a current chunk of 
redisplay (say, a line) before checking for input. At the minimum, you must 
keep track of how far along you had proceeded, so that you don't wind up 
redisplaying your redisplayed text. 
The presence of between-line breakout can affect how your redisplay is 
done. For example, if resources are tight, it may make sense to start by 
redisplaying the line that the point is on, then to go on to the other lines as 
you have time. In that way, the information that is most important to the user 
is the first to get updated. 
Lest there be any doubt: between-line breakout is a very important feature 
and should only be left out of the very simplest implementations or those 

96 
7. Redisplay 
implementations that can complete even the most complex redisplay in under 
100 msec. 
Multiple Windows 
Supporting multiple windows implies that the screen is divided into sections, 
with each section showing a possibly different buffer or part of the buffer. 
There are several ways that multiple windows can be supported: 
• Don't support them. Instead, rely on the (presumed) operating system 
ability to run multiple instances of the editor. This is not desirable because 
the different instances may not be able to communicate quickly with each 
other. For example, you may not be able to "cut" from one window and 
"paste" into another. 
• Support horizontal windows only. Horizontal windows occupy the entire 
width of the screen. This is a good and popular choice. It is not too difficult 
to implement, yet it provides a large chunk of the required functionality. 
• Support both vertical and horizontal windows (tiled). (Better) 
• Support arbitrary overlapped windows. (Best, and supported by many 
windowing packages) 
The main thing to keep in mind when implementing multiple windows is 
that, when two or more windows contain the same text, changes made to one 
should be immediately reflected in the other. 
If you do support multiple windows, you can implement status and prompt 
lines as buffers in themselves and simply fit them in as additional windows to 
be displayed. In this way, you no longer have to consider them as special 
cases. 
Redisplay Itself 
The basic role of redisplay is to ensure that all changes to the sub-editor 
are promptly reflected on the screen. Two major approaches are used by 
implementors to performing redisplay. 
user-commands 
First Approach 
The first approach is for the routines which are invoked by the user to tell 
the redisplay code exactly what they did (e.g., "I deleted 5 characters from 

Redisplay Itself 
97 
here"). This approach is not a very clean one and it is prone to error, as the 
same information must be given twice (once to the sub-editor and once to 
redisplay), and hence an implementation must handle the situation where the 
two sets of instructions are not consistent (e.g. the application tells the sub-
editor to delete a line but tells redisplay to insert a line). This is an especially 
important consideration because we would like to encourage novice users to 
write their own commands. The extra effort of getting the redisplay correct 
might discourage such efforts. 
user-commands 
redisplay 
Second Approach 
The second-and preferred-approach is to have the redisplay code com-
municate with the sub-editor to track the changes. This approach also has 
two methods of operation. 
The first method (which might be called "sub-editor-driven") is to have 
the sub-editor calls communicate directly with the redisplay. For example, 
Insert-Char would make a call to display saying, "I inserted this character at 
this place." The second method (which might be called "redisplay-driven") is to 
have the redisplay operate on its own and ask the sub-editor for information. 
The sub-editor-driven method appears to be simple to implement, but 
upon closer examination turns out to be quite complex. This complexity 
arises for several reasons. 
First, the desirable operations for a sub-editor to offer (as shown in the 
sub-editor procedure interface definitions) do not match well to the available 
operations on displays. Hence, the redisplay code will have to perform this 
conversion. An example would be deleting a line. The code to perform the 
delete might be: 
void Delete_Line (void) 
{ 
mark_name beg; 
Find_FirsUn_Backward (N EWLlNE); 
if (MarLCreate(&beg) != OK) return; 
Find_FirsUn-Forward(NEWLlNE); 
PoinLMove(1 ); 
Copy_Region (kills, beg); 
Delete_Region (beg); 
Mark_Delete(beg); 
} 
/* to start of line' / 
/* to end of line' / 
/* skip over newline' / 
/* save in kill buffer' / 
/* gone' / 

98 
7. Redisplay 
The sub-editor operation is "delete a region" and the region just happens 
to contain a line. Somebody has to examine the region to determine that it 
contains a line and that a "delete line" call to the display might be the correct 
one to use. 
Second, the redisplay code will have to filter the sub-editor operations (and 
subsequent directives) that happen outside the window. 
Third, every change made in the buffer does not necessarily imply a change 
in the display. For example, if the buffer contains the text: 
Here is a line. 
Here is a line. 
Here is a line. 
Here is a line. 
and the first line is deleted, the following lines do not in fact change. That 
particular case may be rare, but the following happens fairly often: 
Here is line 1. 
Here is line 2. 
Here is line 3. 
Here is line 4. 
In this case, the "Here is line" strings should not be redisplayed. 
Fourth, the change might be no change at all. For example, the "lower case 
region" command applied to the text: 
Most people believe the Unicorn to be a mythical animal. 
might have in its inner loop: 
Replace_Char (tolower (GeLChar( ))); 
PoinLMove(1 ); 
This would have the effect of telling redisplay 56 times that a character had 
changed, when in fact only two of those characters were changed. One might 
argue that the Replace_Char routine could check to see whether the new 
character was in fact different before informing redisplay, however: 
• You haven't gained any thing, just changed who is doing the checking. 
• The inner loop could have been written: 
c = GeLChar(); 
Delete (1); 
InserLChar(tolower(c) ); 
The most telling reason for not using the sub-editor-driven method, how-
ever, is more fundamental. The sub-editor's responsibility is to handle the 
buffer, not redisplay. It is the redisplay's responsibility to handle the redisplay 
function. 
The algorithms presented in the remainder of this chapter illustrate the 
basic algorithms. They do not handle all possible error cases, nor do they 

Redisplay Itself 
99 
handle many of the options listed above, such as variable width characters, 
line wrap, between-line breakout, and others. 
The Framer 
The framer is that part of the redisplay code that decides what part of the 
buffer will appear in the window. The redisplay code maintains two marks, 
one at the top of the window and the other at the bottom. 
The algorithm is fairly simple. Here it is: 
int num_lines_window; 
int point-pet; 
/* the number of lines in the window' / 
/* the preferred percentage' / 
void Framer(void) 
{ 
mark_name saved; 
location new_start_loc; 
int cnt; 
/* remember where we started' / 
if (Mark_Create(&saved) ! = OK) { 
Fatal ("can't create mark for redisplay"); 
} 
Find_FirsUn_Backward (N EWLlNE); 
/* count at most one window's worth of lines' / 
for (cnt = 0; cnt < num_lines_window; cnt++) { 
/* stop at the start of the window' / 
if (Is-Point-At-Mark(top_oLwindow» break; 
/* stop at the start of the buffer' / 
if (Compare_Locations (Buffer_Start, Point-Get) >= 0) 
break; 
/* record where a fresh screen would start, 
just ill case we need it' / 
if (cnt == point-pct' num_lines_window) 
new_start_loc = Point-Get(); 
Point-Move ( -1); 
Find_First-ln_Backward(NEWLlNE); 
} 
/* has the window moved? • / 
if (cnt >= num_lines_window) 
Mark_Set(top_oLscreen, new_start_loc); 
Point-To_Mark(saved); 
Mark_ Delete (saved); 
} 
In essence, the algorithm followed by this routine is: "so long as the point 
would still wind up in the window, leave the start of window unchanged. 
If the point would not wind up in the window, place it at the preferred 
percentage."

This version of the algorithm assumes that a buffer line will always occupy 
exactly one window line and that all buffer lines are the same height.

Mark_Delete (saved); 
} 
The preceeding code shows your basic, garden variety redisplay algorithm. 
It will work on any screen that supports cursor positioning (the CLEOL call 
can be simulated by sending Space characters). It will work quite well on 
communications channels running at 4800 bps or over. Its only memory 
requirements are an array large enough to hold the window (typically 1920 
characters). There are no special redisplay "hooks" in the sub-editor manage-
ment code. 
This algorithm is sufficient (and nearly optimal) in those cases where CPU 
and memory are plentiful and the screen does not perform insert/delete line 
or character operations. If memory is tight, the algorithm can be modified to 
only retain a complete copy of the current line. If you must be prepared to 
emulate the CLEOL operation, it may be worthwhile to record the last 
non-blank column in each screen line. Doing so minimizes the number of 
Space characters that must be sent. 
Sub-Editor Interaction 
The basic algorithm can be sped up tremendously if some redisplay-specific 
hooks are placed into the sub-editor. There are a number of different ways 
that the hooks can be introduced. All of these methods track the changes 
made to the buffer in one way or another. 
The first way is to keep a separate modification flag that tells whether any 
changes were made to the buffer since the last redisplay. If no changes were 
made, then redisplay will consist of either a simple cursor motion or a 
complete screen regeneration. 
The seond way, and much more useful, is to keep the modification flag on 
a per-window-line basis. A general interface to accomplish this that works 
with all sub-editor implementation schemes is to define a third type of mark, 
called a window mark. This mark has a flag associated with it. There is one 

102 
7. Redisplay 
window mark for each line in the window. Just after a redisplay has been 
completed, all the flags for all window marks are clear. Each time the sub-
editor changes any of the buffers' contents, it sets the flag on the window mark 
that is located before and closest to the change. The redisplay code can 
examine the flags. Only window lines that have their corresponding window 
marks set need to be examined closely during redisplay. 
Note that window marks need not be located at the start of a buffer line. If 
lines are being wrapped, one will be at each wrap point. If horizontal scrolling 
is being performed, one may be at the start of the buffer line and another at 
the right edge of the window. In this way, changes made to the right of the 
window won't cause the redisplay code to examine unchanged text. 
This interaction is easy to define and implement in the sub-editor. It is 
inexpensive to implement as the marks have to be examined for updating 
anyway. It is also highly effective at reducing CPU overhead, as most 
commands change only a single line. And, although redisplay has to examine 
the flags for every line, most of the time only one or two will show changes. 
A third way is to associate a unique identifier with each window mark 
instead of a flag. This identifier would be changed by the sub-editor whenever 
the associated text changes (i.e., instead of setting a flag it changes the unique 
identifier). Typically, the identifier will be a 32-bit integer. Whenever an 
identifier is required, the current value of the integer is used and the integer 
is incremented. 
The only problem that can arise with using unique identifiers is if a unique 
identifier is not in fact unique. This problem can arise if all 2 A 32 unique 
identifiers are consumed before all lines in the window have changed. 
Some sub-editors that use the linked-line scheme use the addresses of line 
structures as the unique identifiers. While doing so is space efficient, the 
sub-editor must ensure that if a line is freed, the address is not re-used until 
all windows have been completely redisplayed. 
Finally, there is one more flag that can help redisplay a great deal. This flag 
is only useful if the point is located at the end of a buffer line. The flag would 
say whether any buffer modification other than "insert one or more char-
aclers" has been performed. If the flag says not, all that redisplay needs to do 
is to output those characters. As this situation is very common, it can save a 
significant amount of computation. 
The Advanced Algorithm 
The advanced-redisplay algorithm has two improvements over the basic 
algorithm. First, it provides a way of efficiently taking advantage of the 
insert/delete line and character functions which are supplied with many 
screens. Second, it provides a low CPU overhead way of performing a re-
display on basic displays. 
The basic idea used by this algorithm is to assign a unique identifier to each 
window line. (See the preceding section.) When the redisplay encounters a 

Redisplay Itself 
103 
modified line (the unique identifiers don't match), it performs a pattern match 
on the unique identifiers for the remainder of the window. It then uses the 
information derived from that match to determine the best sequence ofinsertj 
delete line commands to issue to the screen. 
In more detail, this algorithm loops over the window lines, checking each 
saved unique identifier against the current identifier returned by the sub-
editor. If they match, no work needs to be done and the algorithm proceeds 
to the next line. If they don't match, it can be for one of three reasons. 
The first reason could be that an additional line or lines were inserted 
between the two window lines. This condition is detected by comparing 
the window-line unique identifier against the rest of the unique identifiers 
returned by the sub-editor and finding a match. (Remember that the window-
line unique identifiers are the unique identifiers returned by the sub-editor 
one redisplay iteration ago.) The insertion case is where we once had lines: 
AB 
and now have: 
ACB 
We determine how many lines are in "C" (because we know how far down we 
had to go to find a match) and tell the screen to insert that many lines. (If 
there is information after this window on the screen, you will first have to 
delete that many lines from the end of the window.) 
The second reason could be that a line (or lines) was deleted. This condition 
is detected by comparing the unique identifier returned by the sub-editor for 
the next line against the unique identifiers of the rest of the window lines and 
finding a match. The deletion case is where we once had lines: 
ABC 
and now have: 
AC 
We determine how many lines are in "B" (because we know how far down we 
had to go to find a match) and tell the screen to delete that many lines. (If 
there is information after this window on the screen, you will eventually have 
to insert that many lines at the end of the window.) 
The third reason could be that the line was changed. This condition is 
detected by comparing the unique identifiers of the following window lines 
against the unique identifiers returned by the sub-editor. This case is either 
where we once had lines: 
ABC 
and now have: 
ADC 

104 
7. Redisplay 
or: 
ADE 
In other words, neither the insertion condition nor deletion condition was 
met. Knowing now that a line has been changed, the next step is to determine 
exactly how the line has changed. 
The algorithm starts by comparing the buffer line against the window line 
and determining how many leading characters are in common. (If the whole 
line is common, no changes need to be made to the screen and the algorithm 
stops.) For example, if the window line is: 
abcdef 
and the buffer line is: 
abcxef 
the two have three characters in common from the start. 
The next step is to repeat the comparison, but work backwards starting 
from the end. The example strings have two characters in common from the 
end. 
The third step is to compare the line lengths. If the two lines are the same 
length, only the changed part in the middle needs to be updated on the screen. 
In the example strings, the lengths are the same (six). This optimization can 
be done even on a basic display. 
If the two lines are not the same length (for example, the buffer line is 
"abcxyzef"), the characters in the window line that are replaced by characters 
in the buffer line can be rewritten (in the example, the "x" replaces the "d"), 
then the requisite number of characters can either be inserted or deleted and 
the remainder of the changes written (insert two characters, "yz"). If there is 
no common text at the end of the line and the buffer line is shorter than the 
window line, a CLEOL call can be used instead of deleting characters. 
Line wrap can pose a problem. The window and buffer lines may have no 
end text in common, and yet an insert or delete character operation might be 
the appropriate one. For example, consider the case where the window width 
is six characters, the window line is "abcdef", and the buffer line is "abcxdef". 
Here, the buffer line will ultimately become two window lines, "abcxde" and 
"f". This case is detected by having no common portion at the end and 
noticing that the line wraps. A more complicated matching process can detect 
the situation and appropriate action can be taken. 
This entire section considered only the (admittedly very common) case 
where line and character insertions and deletions were only made in one 
place. It is very reasonable and appropriate to use more general pattern-
matching techniques to properly optimize multiple insertions and deletions 
(Miller 1987).

Redisplay for Memory-Mapped Displays 
Redisplay for memory-mapped displays boils down to one of three cases. 
Each case is relatively simple. 
First is the case where both reading from and writing to the screen causes 
flicker. The solution is to use the basic redisplay algorithm. 
Second is the case where reading does not cause flicker but writing does. 
The solution is to use the basic redisplay scheme, but change it to use the 
actual window memory for storing the window array. 
In the third case, neither reading nor writing causes flicker. On each re-
display cycle, merely copy the buffer text into window memory, not forgetting 
to process new lines, etc., as needed.

User-Oriented Commands: 
The Command Loop 
He left it dead. and with its head 
He went galumphing back. 
The previous two chapters described a way of dividing an implementation 
into parts and covered the internal sub-editor and redisplay. This chapter 
describes the last part: the user-oriented commands. This last part is what 
gives the editor its "feel." It determines the overall command structure (the 
syntax) and what each of the commands does (the semantics). 
Command structure is a large enough topic to be divided into two chapters. 
This chapter describes how to implement the command structure. The next 
chapter covers command set design issues. It thus describes what commands 
should be implemented. 
The Core Loop: Read, Evaluate, Print 
The command loop is built around a basic core. This core reads in commands, 
evaluates (or executes) them, and prints the results. 
Reading commands is the process of accepting user input and determining 
what operations the user wishes to perform. 
Evaluating commands is the process of carrying out the user's wishes. In 
general, this is done by executing a series of sub-editor calls. 
Printing the results is the redisplay. 
The core loop looks like this: 
char c; 
while (1) { 
c = Key_Get(); 
if (Evaluate (c» break; 
Redisplay( ); 
} 
This loop accepts user input (a single character), evaluates it, exits (if the 

The Core Loop: Read, Evaluate, Print 
107 
user has requested to quit the editor, causing Evaluate to return True), and 
invokes Redisplay. This, like all program examples in this chapter, is a simpli-
fied version of just one of the many ways you can implement these functions. 
They are meant as examples, not as limits. 
The Evaluate Procedure 
FLAG Evaluate (char c) 
{ 
FLAG is_exit = FALSE; 
FLAG is_arg = FALSE; 
int arg = 1; 
while (! (*commands [c]) (&is_arg, &arg, &is-exit, c» { 
c = Key_Get(); 
Redisplay( ); 
} 
return (is_exit); 
} 
This is the core of the Evaluate routine. The is_exit flag records whether 
the command is one to exit the editor. The is_arg flag records whether the 
user has specified a repeat-count argument. The arg variable records the 
repeat-count argument. 
This routine-and the editor implementation-is built around a set of 
command dispatch tables. Each table is an array of pointers to procedures, 
indexed by command characters. Thus, the element: 
commands [' a'] 
would specify the procedure to handle the command designated by the "a" 
character. These procedures all have the same interface. This interface is: 
FLAG Command_Procedure (FLAG *is_argptr, int *argptr, 
FLAG *is_exitptr, char c); 
The first three arguments are pointers to the three state variables. They are 
pointers instead of the values so that the command procedures can alter their 
values. The fourth argument is the character that is used to invoke the 
procedure. The procedure returns True if the command has completed, or 
False ifthe command is incomplete. 
The reasons for selecting this interface will be made clear through four 
sample command procedures: "move by character," "insert character," 
"second-level dispatch," and "accept an argument." 
Move by a Character 
This procedure moves forward by arg characters if arg is positive or back-
ward by arg characters if arg is negative. It looks like this: 

108 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
FLAG Move_By_Character(FLAG *is_argptr, int *argptr, 
FLAG *is_exitptr, char c) 
{ 
Point-Move (*argptr); 
return (TRUE); 
} 
Insert a Character 
This procedure inserts arg copies of the character used to invoke it. If arg is 
negative, its absolute value is used. It looks like this: 
FLAG Insert-A_Character(FLAG *is_argptr, int *argptr, 
FLAG *is_exitptr, char c) 
{ 
int arg = *argptr; 
if (arg < 0) arg = -arg; 
while (arg --> 0) Insert-Char(c); 
return (TRUE); 
} 
Second-Level Dispatch 
This procedure doesn't implement a command itself. Rather, it accepts a 
second character and uses that to select a command from a second dispatch 
table. In this case, the"" X" character will be used as the dispatch. 
FLAG Ctrl_X_Dispatch (FLAG *is_argptr, int *argptr, 
FLAG *is_exitptr, char c) 
{ 
char c; 
c = Delayed_Display(CTRLX_DELAY, ""X"); 
return (* ctrLx_comma nds [ c]) (is_argptr, a rgptr, 
is_exitptr, c»; 
The Delayed_Display routine waits for a character and returns it. If more 
than a specified amount of time passes with no input, the prompt string is 
displayed. 
Note that this routine passes the arguments and exit status to and from the 
second-level command routine. 
Accept an Argument 
Again, this procedure doesn't implement a command itself. Rather, it per-
forms one step of accepting a numeric argument. For the purposes of this 
example, we will assume that all digit characters specify an argument and do 
not insert themselves. 

The Core Loop: Read, Evaluate, Print 
109 
FLAG Argument(FLAG *is_argptr, int *argptr, 
FLAG *is_exitptr, char c) 
{ 
if (!*is_argptr) { 
/* no arg yet * / 
*is_argptr = TRUE; 
*argptr = 0; 
} 
*argptr = *argptr * 10 + c - '0'; 
return (FALSE); 
} 
This routine is the first one that does not completely execute the command. 
Rather, it modifies the state information that is passed to the command 
procedure itself. 
(Note: this routine does not implement the Emacs "universal argument" 
command, but is a simplified version for the purposes of this example only. It 
actually performes vi-style argument handling.) 
Philosophy 
The loop as described puts few (theoretical) restrictions on the command 
syntax. Each character, in its raw form, is mapped to a procedure which 
is in turn evaluated. State information is passed to and from this procedure, 
which can either update the state information, perform an operation, or both. 
Arbitrary syntax and semantics can be implemented with this base. 
In theory, a syntax of commands being words (e.g., "delete," "move," etc.) 
could be implemented in this structure by having either a large number of 
dispatch tables (and thus implementing a symbol-state table architecture) 
or a procedure which parses the syntax of the command via conditional 
statements. If you really want to do one of these, you will want to invent your 
own-different-internal structure. 
A Minimalist Command Set Design 
Consider the thought that every character that is typed at the keyboard 
causes a procedure to be executed. The first conclusion that results is that it 
is silly to type "insert x" or anything like that when you want "x" to be 
inserted. As this is a very common operation, it makes more sense to bind the 
key "x" to an "InsertX" function (or, more probably, the InserLA_Character 
procedure just defined). 
This architecture binds all of the straight, printing ASCII characters to 
commands that insert the character. The remaining things that can be entered 
from most keyboards are the control characters, the delete key, and the break 
key. These could be bound to functions that implement a complex syntax, but 
why bother? It is not too difficult for users to learn even a large number of 
key bindings, so let us bind the control keys directly to useful functions. For 

110 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
example, 1\ F could be "move forward a character," 1\ D could be "delete the 
following character," and so forth. Note that the "break" key does not have 
an ASCII value and is therefore difficult to use without writing operating 
system-specific code. 
Thirty-three functions (the 32 control characters plus the Delete character) 
are not enough for even the commonly used functions. Thus, some of the keys 
should be bound to functions which temporarily rebind the dispatch table. 
For each of these rebinding functions, 128 new functions are made available 
(there is no reason for the printing characters in those second-level tables to 
be bound to "self insert"). 
Thus, even though we began with a structure for the command loop that 
did not impose any constraints on the syntax of commands (and thus was as 
general as possible), we arrived at a specific syntax for commands. This syntax 
is to bind the printing characters to "self insert," bind the control characters 
to a mixture of useful functions and second-level dispatch tables, and to have 
three or four alternate dispatch tables (enough to supply many hundreds of 
commands). Thus, commands are rarely more than two keystrokes long. The 
price that is paid for this brevity is a possibly longer time learning to use the 
editor effectively. 
Note that most of the increased time spent learning the editor is not from 
the brevity of the commands, but because there are more commands to 
learn. Given a "conventional" editor of some other command set design (e.g., 
insert/replace modes or command lines) and an equivalent subset of this 
"minimalist" editor, learning times will probably be comparable when the 
same number of commands from each are covered (assuming sensible com-
mand assignments in both cases). 
Errors 
There are two main types of errors: internal and external. Internal errors are 
those that occur in the editor itself. Examples are a subscript being out of 
range and division by zero. External errors are those that are caused by the 
user. Examples of these are an attempt to delete off the end of the buffer. There 
are also "non-error" errors, such as a normal exit condition. Errors can be 
detected both from within the editor and from outside the editor (for example, 
by the operating system). 
Internal Errors 
Internal errors will be considered first. These errors cause an immediate exit 
to the operating system with no questions asked and no delays tolerated. 
They will be internally generated by such things as arithmetic overflows and 
bad subscripts. (While the editor might catch and process some of these, it 
will not in general process them all. This section only discusses the non-

Errors 
111 
processed ones.) These errors are unpredictable and the state of the editor 
should remain intact. 
The user should also be able to signal such an error to abort out of the 
editor. He or she might want to do this signaling because of a problem with 
the editor itself (e.g., infinite loop) or because he or she wants to do something 
else (e.g., suspend this process and do another task). This signaling is usually 
done with the help of the operating system. In any case, the precise state of 
the editor should be retained so that it can be resumed exactly where it left 
off. Most operating systems have some facility for doing this; they differ 
principally in the freedom of action that they allow before losing the state. 
This freedom ranges from nothing to doing arbitrarily many other things. 
At the user's discretion, the editor should be restartable either from exactly 
where it left off or at a safe restart point. This point is ordinarily a portion of 
the editor which recovers the buffers and other current state information and 
then resumes the command loop. Note that in many implementations, the 
editor must perform actions both on the process suspension and when it 
resumes. These actions must handle saving and restoring the state, restoring 
and saving the display modes, and taking note of any changes in the environ-
ment, such as a window resizing. 
External Errors 
External errors are principally user errors. The action ordinarily taken is the 
display of an error message and a return to command level. The implemen-
tation of this level of recovery is built into the procedures which implement 
the commands. 
There is a variation of external errors which are generated manually by the 
user. Typically, these involve backing out of an undesired state (e.g., the 
unwanted invoking of a dispatch table rebinding or aborting an undesired 
argument). The "G character has often been used for this purpose. In this 
case, the procedures will know that this character has been typed and will 
implement the back-out protocol. 
Exiting 
Finally, provisions to exit the editor must be made. These provisions often 
take the form of a flag variable such as the is-exit variable described earlier. 
Note that various other uses might be multiplexed onto this flag, signifying 
varying levels of "exiting." For example, one level could be used by buffer 
switching in order to rebind the dispatch tables (see the section on modes later 
in this chapter). Alternatively, the different functions could use multiple flag 
variables. 
Ordinary exiting involves several types of processing. The editor might ask 
the user what to do with buffers that have been modified but not written 
out. If, as is ordinarily assumed, the state of the editor is preserved across 

112 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
invocations, the state must be saved. If not, it must be sure that all memory 
is deallocated. Finally, the user's environment should be restored as it was 
found. This implies such varied things as cleaning up the stack, closing files, 
deallocating unneeded storage, and resetting terminal parameters. 
Arguments 
Arguments are specified by the user to modify the behavior of a function. The 
Emacs argument mechanism will be described as an example of three diverse 
ways in which arguments are obtained. 
There are three standard argument types. First are numeric (prefix) argu-
ments. These are invoked by a string of functions (which are in turn invoked 
by characters typed before the "actual" command character) and are an 
example of using the key/function binding to implement a more complicated 
syntax. Next are string (suffix) arguments. When obtaining a string argument, 
the editor is invoked recursively on an argument buffer, and upon return from 
the recursive invocation the contents of that buffer are given to the requesting 
procedure. Last are positional arguments. These are the internal variables of 
the editor. 
Numeric (Prefix) Arguments 
Prefix arguments are entered before the command whose behavior the argu-
ments are modifying, thus, their syntax does not depend upon the command. 
The interpretation of prefix arguments can vary from command to command. 
Emac type editors limit these arguments to numeric values. 
Ordinarily, commands will have an internal variable available to them 
named something like arg, and it will have a value of one. Prefix arguments 
allow the user to change that value to any other positive or negative integer. 
It is useful to provide a mechanism for command procedures to determine 
whether an argument has been given at all. This mechanism allows the proce-
dures to handle the default case where no arguments are supplied differently 
than the case where an argument is supplied. 
Each command uses arguments for different, but related, purposes. 
The first purpose is to specify a repeat count for a command. Thus, speci-
fying an argument of "12" to the "forward character" command would cause 
the command to move forward 12 characters. 
The second purpose is to tell a command to use a specific value. For 
example, it doesn't make sense to say "move to the end of the buffer" 12 times. 
Instead, that command might interpret its argument as a line number and 
move to the specified line of the buffer. In this case, the "default" value would 
be the (end of the) last line. 
An Emacs-type text editor uses the /\ U character as the "universal argu-
ment" function. It can be used in either of two ways. /\ U command means to 

Arguments 
113 
supply an argument of "4" to command. Adding another /\ U means to 
multiply the current argument by four. Thus, /\ U /\ U /\ U command means to 
supply an argument of 64 to the command. The factor of 4 was selected 
because 5 is too large (1, 5, 25, 125 goes up too fast) and, while 3 might have 
better spacing (1, 3,9, 27, 81,243), the powers of 4 are known by all people 
who are likely to be around computers. In addition, on a 24 x 80 display, 64 
is about the number of characters per line and 16 is 2/3 of the screen height. 
The other use is to specify a value exactly. /\ U number command means to 
supply an argument of number to the command. For example, /\ U - 1 4 7 
command means to supply an argument of -147 to the command. The /\ U 
in this case serves as an "escape" to logically rebind the digit and "-" keys. If 
you want to supply an argument to the commands normally invoked by the 
digit and '-' characters, you use the quote command, located on /\Q. 
On some terminals, there are two sets of numeric keys. One set is across the 
top row and always sends the ASCII code for the corresponding digit charac-
ter. Another set may form a numeric pad and its keys can be configured to 
send either the ASCII codes for the digit characters or different codes. In this 
case, these "other numbers" can be bound directly to functions that set up the 
implied arguments and the initial /\ U is not needed. 
String (Suffix) Arguments 
Numeric arguments are made available in the same way to all commands. 
Suffix arguments, however, must be explicitly requested by the commands 
that use them. A command may also request multiple suffix arguments. Most 
suffix arguments are for strings, not numbers. 
The program notifies the user of the string argument by displaying a 
prompt. This prompt indicates the type of argument that is requested. The 
user responds by entering the value up through and including a terminating 
character. The command then proceeds to execute, using the value in whatev-
er way is appropriate. 
The following points should be taken into consideration regarding string 
arguments. 
First, the prompt should clearly state what is being asked for-for example, 
"Name of the file to be read." 
Second, the key or key sequence used to terminate the end of the string 
should be able to vary and should be indicated in the prompt-for example, 
"Name of the file to be read (Return):" or "String to search for (ESC):" There 
should be a way to cleanly abort out of the prompt and its requesting 
command. This should be the same command used for the "abort" command 
(e.g., /\G). 
Third, in order to facilitate the abort process, the command should first ask 
for all user input, and only then perform any actions. This organization means 
that any abort will result in no effect rather than leave inconsistent state 
information. 

114 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
Each command that requests a string prompt should provide a default 
value for the prompt. This value should be used if the user enters a null 
response. The value should be the program's best guess about what value the 
user would most likely want to enter. If no other guess is available, the last 
value entered should be used. 
Here are some examples of string arguments: 
• Search string: Ask for a string and search for the next occurrence of it in 
the buffer. If the user enters a null string, use the same string that was last 
entered. 
• Write file: Ask for a string and, using it as a file name, write the contents 
of the buffer to the specified file. If the user enters a null string, use the 
current file name associated with the buffer. 
• Change buffer: Ask for a string and switch to the buffer whose name is the 
user's response. If the user enters a null string, use the buffer that was last 
the current one (i.e., the one that the user was in before the one that the 
user is in now). Note that this default may not be the one whose name was 
last entered. 
Here are some example prompts: 
• Name of the file to write to (Return, default /home/fin/test): 
• String to search forward for (ESC): 
• Name of the buffer to switch to (1\ M, default chapterS): 
While these examples were requesting a character string, this need not 
always be the case. For example, to enter numeric values, the requesting 
procedure merely has to convert the read-in character string to a numeric 
value. An example of such a command would be a "go to line" command. 
One way to implement the routine that accepts string arguments is to use 
a variation of the Get-Line routine defined in the Introduction. However, a 
better way to implement this routine is to create an argument buffer in a new 
window, display a prompt, and call the editor recursively with that as the 
current buffer. By following this scheme, the full power of the editor is avail-
able to correct typing mistakes or otherwise make the entry process easier. It 
has the additional advantage of not creating a new "mode": the user is free to 
continue editing while responding to the prompt. 
Further, the full power of the editor can be brought to bear on a problem. 
For example, suppose that someone sends you a mail message that says "the 
answer is in file x." While reading the mail message, you give the "find file" 
command. This command prompts you to enter a file name. You switch 
buffers (from the prompt buffer to the mail message buffer), copy the file name, 
switch back, and paste it into the prompt, then type the prompter terminator. 
Voilci A fully integrated, modeless environment. 
Finally, the prompts need not be "lifeless" and "passive." A passive prompt 
just accumulates the input until complete, then passes it back as a block. It 
has no interaction. A "lively" and "active" prompt offers interaction with the 

Rebinding

user. For example: 
• Searching: The search can be incremental, with the search proceeding as 
the user types. 
• File names: The program can offer file name completion, where the user can 
enter a prefix, press a key, and the program fills in as much of the file name 
as possible. A different key might display a list of all file names that match 
what has already been typed. 
Positional Arguments 
Positional arguments are not directly specifiable by the user. They are the 
editor's internal state variables. Such variables include both those required by 
the editor (e.g., the length of the buffer, the locations of the point and the 
mark, etc.) and those which have a specialized purpose (e.g., the current value 
of the right-hand margin, the tab spacing, etc.). 
Often these values are used in unusual ways. For example, the horizontal 
position (column) of the point can often be a more pleasant way of specifying 
a value than entering a number. The user can indicate that "this is where I 
want the right margin to be" instead of having to count characters to get a 
number. 
A specialized positional argument is the region. This is the range of text 
delimited by the point and the mark. By convention, it does not matter 
whether the point or the mark is placed earlier in the buffer. 
Selection Arguments 
The use of graphical input devices opens up new ways of issuing commands 
and specifying arguments. For example, the cursor can be moved by a graph-
ical input device as well as the more traditional point-motion commands. In 
addition, a region can be specified by a "click and drag" operation (or whatev-
er sequence is used by the operating system). 
Rebinding 
Binding is the act of connecting a name and a meaning, rebinding the act of 
changing the binding. In the case of editors, there are two different levels that 
binding (and rebinding) can occur on. 
The first is at the key level. Binding in this case means attaching an opera-
tion to a key. These bindings are often implemented by means of a dispatch 
table. 
The second is at the function level. Binding in this case means attaching 
a procedure to an operation. Again, these bindings are often implemented by 
means of a dispatch table. 

116 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
For example, the alphabetic keys may be bound to the "insert" operation. 
This operation, in turn, can be bound to a variety of procedures: 
• The basic "insert a character" procedure. 
• The basic procedure, but one that saves a copy of the buffer every so often. 
• The basic procedure, but one that performs word wrap (by inserting hard 
newlines, not in redisplay). This is often called something like "fill mode." 
• A different basic procedure, say one that performs replacement (overwrite) 
instead of insertion. 
Implementations can perform at one of two levels of rebinding: static and 
dynamic. Static rebinding is when the new procedure is known about at the 
time that the editor is invoked. All implementations can perform this level of 
rebinding. Dynamic rebinding is possible when the new procedure can be 
defined after the editor is invoked. Unless otherwise stated, this discussion 
assumes dynamic rebinding. 
To a first approximation, editors that are written in compiled languages 
(e.g., C and Pascal) can only perform static rebinding, and editors that are 
written in interpreted languages (e.g., Lisp) can also perform dynamic re-
binding. Dynamic linking, however, allows compiled editors to include new 
procedures at run time, and so this distinction is not always a proper one to 
make. Dynamic bindings are also possible when a compiled language is used 
to implement an interpreted language, which in turn implements at least the 
user command portion of the editor. 
Rebinding Keys 
The process of key rebinding is relatively simple and is done essentially the 
same way in all implementations. A set of dispatch tables is used to map keys 
(represented by their ASCII values) to their respective functions. 
In languages such as C and Lisp, the table can contain the pointer to 
the procedures themselves. In less powerful languages such as Fortran and 
Pascal, the dispatch table branches to a different part of the same routine that 
contains the table. There, the procedure call is made. In languages that supply 
it, a case statement can be used instead of the n-way branch. 
All of these command procedures have the same formal parameters, and so 
they can all be invoked with the same calling sequence. Thus, the C and Lisp 
direct invocations can work properly. Note also that simple commands do 
not have to have a separate procedure assigned to them, but the code to 
execute them can be placed in-line in place of a call (where the case-statement 
equivalent is used). Making this substitution loses some potential flexibility. 
Rebinding Functions 
Dynamic rebinding is ordinarily a language-supplied feature and so it will not 
be discussed in depth. Two comments will, however, be made on how to 
simulate it. 

Modes 
117 
If the underlying operating system has dynamic linking (e.g., Multics, OS/2, 
and some new UNIX systems), a procedure may be rebound at run time. 
Dynamic linking is a way of linking procedures together in which the actual 
link is not made until the procedure is about to be executed. At that time, the 
procedure is located in the file system and brought into memory. The link 
may either be left alone, in which case the next call will have the procedure 
re-Iocated (a relatively expensive process) or it may be snapped. Snapping a 
link is the process of converting the general call instruction (which is kept in 
a special, writeable part of the program) into a call instruction to the appro-
priate address. If a link is snapped, it must be explicitly unsnapped before any 
rebinding is done. 
If the operating system does not support dynamic linking, you might 
choose to simulate it manually. Such a process is complex, and some thought 
will have to be given to the desirability of rebinding functions. The process is 
tantamount to explicit overlaying. 
This all has a straightforward bearing on rebinding functions. Rebinding a 
function involves changing the definition of the procedure that is invoked by 
referencing it. What has been discussed are ways of changing such a proce-
dure definition. Note that if the code to execute a function is inserted in-line 
in the basic editor, it cannot be rebound by any of these methods. 
If dynamic linking is not available and is not feasible to simulate, there is 
still one way out. This way will only provide static rebinding. Instead of just 
using one dispatch table which indicates a procedure to be called directly, use 
two. Use the first table to map from keys to the operation to be performed 
(e.g., A F is mapped to "moving forward one character") and the second table 
to map from the operation to be performed to a procedure that will perform 
it (e.g., "moving forward one character" is mapped to the Forward_Char 
procedure). 
Modes 
A mode is a collection of command rebindings. Modes can be invoked implic-
itly, explicitly, or automatically. 
An implicitly invoked mode is one that is not visible to the user. Implicit 
modes are used to support large, infrequently used commands. For example, 
suppose that you had an editor command that played the game Adventure. 
You probably wouldn't want the code for that command to be occupying 
resources whenever you were using your editor for editing. However, you 
might still want to make your "adventure" command available at all times. 
In this case, you would use an implicit mode. The "adventure" command 
would then take these steps: 
o 
Load the modules that implement the command. 
o 
Rebind the key that invoked the "adventure" command to run the new 
code. 
o 
Run the code the first time. 

118 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
From now on, whenever the user gives the "adventure" command, the 
editor will directly execute that code. 
An explicitly invoked mode is one that the user asks to use. Examples of 
such modes are "auto fill" mode, "auto save" mode, and alternate command 
sets. The common element is that the user gives a command, knowing that 
that command itself has no function other than to persistently alter the key 
bindings. 
An automatically invoked mode is one which the implementation deter-
mines is appropriate to invoke, based on a command given by the user that 
"appeared" to do something else. 
One example of an automatically invoked mode is a language mode (for 
example, a "C" mode). This mode will automatically be invoked whenever the 
user edits a C source file (by convention, one whose name ends in ".c" or ".h"). 
Such a mode might do the following: 
• Rebind the internal variable that identifies which characters are legal in 
tokens (i.e., variable names) to also include the "_" character, which can 
occur within C names. This change would make the Forward_Word func-
tion treat a C variable name as a word. 
• Similarly rebind the sentence and paragraph operations to operate on 
statements and language blocks. 
• Rebind the";" key to be an "electric" semicolon so that typing a ";" to 
finish one statement would cause the editor to determine and insert the 
appropriate indentation. 
• Similarly rebind the Tab, Return, and Line Feed keys. 
• Replace the "fill" or "reformat" paragraph command with one that "pret-
typrints" the current language block. 
And so forth. Another example of an automatically invoked mode is 
the specialized mode that the editor places you in when executing such 
commands as "help," "read mail," and "view a directory." In these commands, 
the user is effectively placed in a specialized application that shares as much 
as possible with the regular editor commands, but does have its own extra 
commands. For example, in the "view a directory" application, the "d" key 
might delete a file, the "r" key might rename a file, and so forth. However, the 
"buffer" or "window" switch command should still be available so that the 
user can perform other editing while the special application is active. 
Modes and Dynamic Rebinding 
The function rebindings that are commonly done by an editor are known in 
advance and so they can be done by any implementation (see the preceding 
section for a discussion of the difficulties involved in function rebinding). 
Fully dynamic rebinding (the new definition of the procedure is not known 
until run time) is desirable for several reasons: 

Changing Your Mind 
119 
o 
Debugging is greatly eased if the trial-and-error cycle time is reduced by 
not having to compile and link the whole editor each time. Instead, only 
one function has to be recompiled and linked. 
o 
Space savings are achieved if unneeded modes and autoloaded single 
functions are not brought into memory until called. 
o If the editor is implemented in an interpreted language, users can develop 
their own functions relatively easily. Such "sideline" development is ad-
vantageous because it allows many people to develop useful programs. 
Thus, the editor can be specialized in many more ways than any reason-
able support group could ever implement on its own. Implementation in 
an interpreted language also encourages tailoring the editor to a user's 
own taste, enhancing his or her productivity. 
Implementing Modes 
Modes are defined on a per-buffer basis and so an implementation must 
provide for changing these bindings as the current buffer is switched. The 
general technique for doing this is to have a set of default bindings for the 
editor, a set of current bindings for each buffer, and a set of procedures that 
can be invoked to change the former into the latter. When a buffer switch is 
made, the current bindings are used to dispatch all commands. 
Whenever a change to the mode list is made-especially one that removes 
a mode-the editor must initialize the current bindings to the default bind-
ings, then invoke each mode procedure in turn to make its changes. 
Changing Your Mind 
This section discusses the methods used to help users who want to change 
their minds about an editing command. 
Command Set Design 
By far the most effective step that you can take is to design the command set 
to minimize both state variables and changes of perspective. Such proper 
design is far more effective than any other tool. However, as these topics are 
covered in the next chapter and in Chapter 1, they won't be discussed here. 
Kill Ring 
The most basic way in which a user can change his or her mind is to delete 
something, then say "oops, I didn't want to delete that." After all, if the user 
inserted extra text, deleting it is easy and straightforward. However, retyping 
accidentally deleted text is in general neither easy nor straightforward. Hence, 
an important feature to provide is the ability to save that text for the user. 

120 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
This feature can be added as a single-level save (referred to as the kill buffer) 
or a multiple-level save (the kill ring). 
As an extra benefit, once the deleted text is saved, that feature can be used 
for "cut and paste" operations. In addition, the saved text can be tied into the 
system "clipboard" or similar facility. 
An Emacs-type editor records multiple text-deletions in a "kill ring" (for 
historical reasons, commands that save the deleted text were called "kill" 
commands). Some small but fixed number of the successive deletions are 
stored together. The "yank" or "paste" command retrieves the last such 
deletion (inserting it at the point). Alternate "yank" commands are available 
that cycle through the kill ring, re-deleting the last-yanked text and replacing 
it with the next item. (A ring is better than a single kill buffer because it can 
store multiple deletions. It is superior to a stack of separate buffers because 
of the ease with which various "undeletions" can be tried out.) 
It is easy to implement such a kill ring. A buffer is designated as the one to 
hold the deleted text and the commands that perform the deletion simply 
copy the text that they are about to delete to that buffer before performing 
the actual deletion. There are two fine points to the implementation. 
First, successive deletion commands should add to the current deletion, not 
create a new one. Thus, the Emacs commands: 
AU A[ d 
which deletes the next four words, should have exactly the same effect as: 
A[d A[d A[d A[d 
i.e., four successive "delete word" commands. In both cases, all four words 
should be part of the same deletion. 
Second, your implementation must take care to delete properly. Deleting 
following items (characters, words, sentences, etc.) should add to the end of 
the deleted text. Deleting previous items should add to the beginning of the 
deleted text. Not coincidentally, all deletion commands in the command 
set of Emacs-type editors are of the form "delete following ... " or "delete 
previous ... " with the exception of the "delete current line" command. This 
command must take the text from the point to the end of the line and add it 
to the end ofthe deleted text, and take the text from the point to the beginning 
of the line and add it to the start. 
Undo 
The "kill ring" approach requires explicit support from the user commands 
and provides considerable power, yet there are many ways in which it does 
not make it easy for a user to change his or her mind. An "undo" facility is 
the most general way that you help a user when he or she changes his or her 
mind. 
In principle, an undo facility provides a mechanism for reversing changes 
made by the user. These effects can be as simple as moving the point or 

Changing Your Mind 
121 
inserting or deleting a character, or as complex as a file write or global 
replace. 
Note, however, that you may still want to provide the kill ring, as it offers 
both one intuitive (if limited) type of undo, as well as operations that undo 
cannot perform. For example, you cannot implement "cut and paste" with 
undo, except for the limited case where you only want to paste the text exactly 
where you cut it from! 
Unlike the kill ring, which requires explicit support in the user commands, 
the best place to provide support for undo is in the sub-editor interface. Note 
that this is in the interface, not the sub-editor itself, although in general the 
undo facility will work closely with the sub-editor. 
The support works like this: each sub-editor procedure that makes any 
change to a state variable or the buffer first makes a note of what is to be 
changed, then records the pre-change value, then finally makes the change. 
For example, the Point-Set routine would record "the point is about to 
change," and the old (current) location of the point. It would then change the 
point's location. Note that some procedures (such as the ones to delete a 
block of text) must record arbitrarily large amounts of state information. 
This type of recording allows you to back up as far as you like. Since, in 
essence, each change to the state information is recorded, all earlier states are 
recoverable by reversing each state change (in reverse order, of course). 
There is more to implementing undo than just recording state changes, but 
the additional items are more icing than cake. 
First, most undo commands operate on a user-command, not sub-editor 
call, basis. Thus you must also record when a new user command is given. 
Thus, each undo then undoes consecutive changes until it reaches such a 
command marker. In this way, even a complex global replace can be undone. 
Note that in general you will wish to have repeated undo commands undo 
successively-earlier other commands. 
Second, it probably makes sense to undo an entire consecutive set of newly-
typed characters as a single command. 
Third, the resources available to retain the undo information may be 
limited. This design minimizes that problem, as the "excess" undo state can 
simply drop off the end. The part that is retained will still be consistent. 
Fourth, the operating system may not support the undoing of file-level 
operations or other commands. In some cases, you can simulate such undoing 
(say, by making a backup file), but in general you will have to live with some 
limits to undo. (Undoing a print operation after the printing is complete is 
quite difficult.) 
Fifth, state information is kept in places other than in the sub-editor. These 
other places must also be incorporated into the undo facility. 
An Undo Heresy 
Is undo a nice feature to offer? Yes. Is it vital to an editor? Probably not. Will 
adding it make a poorly designed editor into a good one? No. Will it make 

122 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
such an editor acceptable? Maybe. As was said earlier, the best way to help 
the user is with a good command set design: it will minimize the need or desire 
for an undo. 
While undo is a general-purpose facility that has good applications, it is 
not clear that a text editor is one of them. The "good design" approach (using 
the Emacs command set as an example) and the undo approach will now be 
compared in their approach to moving around in text and deleting text. 
Moving around in text is simply solving the problem "I am at X and 1 want 
to be at Y." The good design solution involves translating this difference into 
a sequence of commands to move the point from X to Y. If a mistake is made 
in the process of implementing the solution, the problem is merely restated to 
"I am at X' and 1 want to be at Y" and it is re-solved. The undo solution differs 
by detecting the error (i.e., deviation from the intended solution), saying 
"undo" to put you back on the original path, and proceeding. Ordinarily this 
difference between the two solutions is not very great. 
If the user has accidentally moved a large distance (say, to the start of the 
buffer), it becomes a little more difficult for the user to recover his or her 
earlier position. Emacs-type editors resolve this issue by having the large-
movement commands set the mark to where you were. Thus, an interchange 
point and mark sequence will recover from the error. Keep in mind that 
almost all of the time, the user does not care where the mark happens to be. 
The two approaches are all but identical in the text deletion case. On the 
one hand, accidentally-deleted text is recovered with a "yank" command, and 
on the other hand, with an "undo" command. 
In conclusion, undo is a nice extra feature, but is no substitute for a good 
design. 
Redo 
Redo is the mechanism for undoing an undo. Conceptually, the record of 
undos is: 
# 1 most-recent command changes 
#2 next-most-recent command changes 
# 3 next-next-most-recent command changes 
The first invocation of the "undo" command undoes # 1. The next invoca-
tion undoes # 2, and so forth. Redo redoes the most recent undo, with 
repeated "redo" commands moving back up the undo stack. Let's look at an 
implementation: 
FLAG Undo(FLAG *is_argptr, int *argptr, FLAG *is_exitptr, char c) 
{ 
if (undo_ptr == NULL) undo_ptr = last-command_undo; 
Undo_Command (undo_ptr); 
undo_ptr = Previous(undo_ptr); 

Macros 
123 
return (TRUE); 
} 
FLAG Redo(FLAG *is_argptr, int *argptr, FLAG *is_exitptr, char c) 
{ 
if (undo_ptr == NULL) 
Error("No undo to redo"); 
else { 
Redo_Command (undo_ptr); 
undo_ptr = Next(undo_ptr); 
} 
return (TRUE); 
} 
and, in the main command loop: 
if (lasLcmd != Undo && lasLcmd != Redo) undo_ptr = NULL; 
The Undo procedure checks and, if it hasn't been called "recently," starts at 
the latest command. It undoes the command, then sets a pointer to point to 
the undo information for the previous command. 
The Redo procedure checks and, if Undo hasn't been called "recently," can't 
run, as there is no undo to redo. Otherwise, it redoes the command and sets 
a pointer to point to the undo information for the next command. 
The main command loop determines whether the Undo or Redo procedures 
have been called "recently." Basically, if the last command wasn't undo or 
redo, it resets the undo pointer to null. 
This implementation allows arbitrary undoing and redoing in any combi-
nation, so long as the commands are given sequentially. Bear in mind that 
with the "change in state" recording of undo information, it is only legal to 
apply those changes in the correct order. 
This implementation ignored the arguments to the undo and redo 
commands. Feel free to assign reasonable interpretations to the arguments in 
your implementations. 
Macros 
In a sense, macros allow a user to give commands by specifying them implic-
itly instead of explicitly. Macros fall into three general levels. 
Again 
The "again" facility allows a user to say "do what I just did again." For it to 
be most useful (i.e., easier to type than retyping the command), it should be 
assigned to a short key sequence (i.e., one shifted key). 
The "repeat count" argument to the "again" command should be used 
instead of the previous "repeat count" argument to the command being 
repeated. 

124 
8. User-Oriented Commands: The Command Loop 
Keystroke Recording 
This facility allows the user to say "start recording," then give a series 
of commands (observing their effects as they are typed), then say "stop 
recording." Later, the entire sequence of keystrokes can be replayed with 
a "play recording" command. A "repeat count" argument to the "play 
recording" command will cause the recording to be replayed the specified 
number of times. Note that commands within the recording can have repeat 
count arguments of their own. 
Macro Languages 
Finally, the editor should provide the user full access to the editor's macro 
language (if any). This language will in general provide a full programming 
language, thus allowing the user to specify an arbitrary set of editing opera-
tions as well as a way of naming these procedures for later invocation and key 
rebinding. 
Redisplay Interaction 
The introduction of keystroke recording and macro languages only serves to 
underscore the separation between the redisplay code and the rest of the 
editor described in the previous chapter. The playback of recorded keystrokes 
will almost certainly complete with no intervening redisplay. Thus, if any of 
the code based its actions on the current window contents, it would almost 
certainly execute incorrectly.

Command Set Design 
"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? 
Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
Previous chapters have discussed the external constraints on implementa-
tions and the division of the editor into more manageable pieces. You now 
understand how to build an editor. But which editor should you build? This 
chapter discusses various issues involved with designing the editor's com-
mand set. 
Your editor implementation will (you hope) be used by many people. 
Regardless of the expertise of these people, there are some design principles 
that should be followed. A good design incorporates these qualities: 
• Responsiveness 
• Consistency 
• Permissiveness 
• Progress 
• Simplicity 
• Uniformity 
• Extensibility 
Each of these qualities will be discussed in turn. 
Responsiveness 
Responsiveness means that each action taken by the user is handled and 
confirmed immediately. In other words, the application responds well to the 
user. This good response allows skilled users to work fast. 
A different name for responsiveness is visible effect, which is to say that 
every action taken by the user has a visible effect on the display. This effect 
might be simple cursor motion, a change in the text being shown, or a 
message. Even if only an internal state variable is changed, that state variable 
should have an indicator on the display. (Ringing the display's bell is consid-

126 
9. Command Set Design 
ered to be a "visible" effect for the purposes of this section.) By following this 
principle, the user is never in doubt whether the application is keeping up 
with his or her typing or has received a command: there is consequently never 
a need to issue a command because of doubt or uncertainty. 
On some displays, the desire for a visible effect can conflict with other 
design goals such as minimizing display flicker. One solution to this problem 
is to delay the display of visible effect until the user stops typing for a few 
seconds. In this way, as long as a user is typing, he or she is presumed to know 
what he or she is doing and so the feedback is less important. However, if the 
user should stop typing, the application would quickly show the current state. 
An important ramification of responsiveness is good error-checking. User 
input should be checked as soon as logically possible after it has been entered. 
If the input passes the check, some sort of confirmation is given (e.g., a 
message or beep). If the input fails the check, an error indicator is displayed. 
As a general rule, no incorrect input should be accepted, unless it is infeasible 
to perform the check. Different checks will naturally be performed at different 
times. For example, if the user is being asked to enter a number in a specified 
range, the individual characters can be checked as they are typed to ensure 
that they are digits. The number as a whole cannot be range-checked until the 
user has indicated that it is complete (say by pressing the Return key). 
Consistency 
Consistency means that all parts of the application work the same way. This 
topic is covered in more detail in the section on "modes." 
Permissiveness 
Permissiveness means that the user is in control of the application and not 
vice versa. While this might sound tautological at first, it is a principle that is 
often honored only in the breach. Think of the applications that you have 
used that lead you through a step-by-step process, with only limited choices 
at each step. Often, these applications do not allow you to review or change 
earlier decisions short of aborting the whole application and starting over 
from scratch. 
Writing a permissive application is both easier and harder than writing a 
non-permissive version of the same one. It is harder because the implementa-
tion has to be able to handle any request at any time. (An "event-message-
object" design model makes it easy to handle such unpredictable requests.) If 
some process is multi-step, the application must have interlocks to prohibit 
processing the steps out of order (and of course these interlocks should have 
their state variables displayed). It is easier because you as a designer do not 

Simplicity 
127 
have to anticipate all possible paths through the application and decide in 
advance which ones are reasonable. 
Progress 
Progress means that each command should meet some part of the user's 
goals. An example of a command that does not make progess would be a 
command to "show the current line." This command does not contribute to 
making any of the changes that the user (presumably) desires: it just wastes 
the user's time and effort. It is the elimination of such commands that makes 
screen-oriented text editors such an improvement over the older ones. 
In general, there should be no commands for the user to give that merely 
tell the application to do something that it has enough information to figure 
out on its own. For example, if the user moves to the end of the buffer, the 
application should display that part of the buffer. (Actually, as stated this 
principle is a bit harsh. From time to time, the application will not be able to 
guess correctly and it is acceptable to have a way for the user to take control. 
For example, sometimes the user wants to position the window to include two 
areas of particular interest. The application in general cannot detect this case. 
But if that happens often, there is a design problem.) 
Simplicity 
Simplicity goes under the sobriquet of "keep simple things simple." Compli-
cated things can be complicated (or simple if that works out), but simple 
things should never be complicated. 
This principle means that the basic editing operations (insert, delete, move) 
should be as conceptually simple as possible. For example, inserting a charac-
ter is a conceptually simple operation. The simplest way of expressing that 
operation is to just type that character. Having input/edit (or "input/ 
overtype" or "insert/replace") modes is an example of making a simple thing 
complicated. With the input/edit mode, inserting a character becomes "am I 
in insert mode? No. Then type the 'go into insert mode' command, type the 
character, and maybe type the 'leave insert mode' command." Hardly simple. 
This principle is closely related to efficiency. It is natural to think that the 
command set that requires the fewest user operations is the best one to use. 
Unfortunately, that natural thought does not remain valid when taken to 
extremes. On an extreme basis, the set of editing operations could be Huffman 
encoded into a command set. While the resulting command set would be 
optimally efficient, it would probably not be usable. For example, the com-
mand to insert the string "the" might be 
1\ X 7. On the other hand, simple 
things tend to be efficient if for no other reason than that they don't have the 

128 
9. Command Set Design 
baggage of being complicated. Ideally, the most-often used commands should 
be the shortest. 
Uniformity 
Uniformity also goes under the names "regularity," "predictability," and 
"orthogonality." Basically, a command set is uniform if, when a user knows 
some part of it, he or she can predict the unknown parts. Another way of 
looking at it is that the command set fits into a pattern. 
This principle is important in that the user is freed from learning each 
command separately. Instead, the user learns some of the commands and a 
set of rules for generating the rest. For example, here are the basic Emacs 
character commands: 
A F 
move forward character 
A B 
move backward character 
A D 
delete the following character 
A H 
delete the preceding character 
(Keep in mind that 
A H is also the Back Space key.) Here are the word 
commands: 
move forward word 
move backward word 
delete the following word 
delete the preceding word 
A user learns these commands by learning this basic command set: 
F 
move forward .. . 
B 
move backward .. . 
D 
delete the following .. . 
A H 
delete the preceding .. . 
and these rules: 
control-shifted means "character" 
A [-prefixed means "word" 
It is rare that a command set will ever be completely uniform. However, it 
is important to take advantage of uniformity where possible. 
Extensi hili ty 
Extensibility means the ability to accommodate changes. This principle has 
a number of aspects. First, changes can be accommodated by designing in 
"holes" or "gaps" where users can install commands of their own. Second, the 
command set can be made rich ("large") as the larger number of commands 
provides more places for commands to be placed. Third, a uniform command 

Modes 
129 
set helps extensibility. For example, if the command set has a set of "sentence" 
operations (move by, delete by), these can be converted as a set into "state-
ment" operations for use in programming languages. 
Modes 
This chapter uses the word "mode" in a different way from the command-set-
oriented use of "mode" from earlier chapters. It is unfortunate that the same 
word is used by the industry in different ways. 
What are "modes," and why should you care about them? Simply put, a 
design has a mode when an end user has to do an "unnecessary" action in 
order to do the desired action. You should care about modes because having 
modes can make a program harder to use. As a programmer, you are used to 
modes and deal with them constantly without conscious thought. Your end 
users, however, may be confused by the presence of modes. Their thinking 
might go something like "I pressed the 'f' key (at command level) and it 
showed me an 'f', so why does pressing the 'f' key here move me forward by a 
screen?" 
The definition just presented is a little abstract, so an example is in order. 
A piano is a device that has (almost) no modes. If you want a piano to 
make a sound, you just press a key. Each key is independent: it produces the 
same note regardless of which other keys were pressed before. 
A piano really does have modes. You select the modes with the foot pedals. 
It is easy to learn to overlap the key presses with the foot pedal ups and 
downs, so the modes, although present, do not interfere with playing the 
piano. Moreover, the modes have a great deal of overlap with the basic keys. 
In a manner of speaking, the piano's "command set" is quite orthogonal. 
A typical scientific calculator has many modes. An example of such a mode 
is the degrees/radians selection. If you are in degrees mode and want to 
compute the sine of an angle in radians, you must first switch to radians mode 
and then compute the sine. Switching to radians is not part of your calcula-
tion. Rather, it is something that you have to do in order to perform your 
calculation. Hence, the calculator has a mode. A similar-but less useful-
mode in a text editor would be an insert/overwrite (or replace) mode. 
These examples are at the extremes of the range. The piano is an almost 
modeless device, while a calculator has many modes. 
What does all this have to do with designing an editor's command set? 
These things: 
• You should have as few modes as possible; 
• Modes should be aligned with the activity; 
• If you must have a mode, make it visible. 
Adding keys (or a mouse) can reduce the number of modes. For example, 
having both "sine in degrees" and "sine in radians" keys would eliminate the 

130 
9. Command Set Design 
degrees/radians mode. However, there is an upper limit to the number of keys 
that you can put on a user input device, be it a calculator or a keyboard. 
Rearranging the modes so that they coincide with natural breaks in the 
activity also reduces confusion. For example, it is not too unreasonable to 
have a "text editor mode" and a "spread sheet" mode, where the two modes 
correspond to completely different applications. Switching modes is less con-
fusing because the end user is mentally changing gears at the same time. On 
the other hand, with modern computers' ability to rapidly switch between 
different application programs, it can be very valuable to have the different 
applications present the same interface to the end user: doing anything else is 
often not in the end-users' best interests. Of course, if you did provide addi-
tional functions within the text editor, the differences in the modes would be 
minimized. 
Returning to the example of an insert/edit mode for an editor, we can see 
how that mode is not aligned with a change in activity. To the user, "editing" 
is a single activity that comprises both deletion and insertion. Changing 
between insert and edit modes is thus a mode change with no accompanying 
activity change. 
Some text editors offer an insert/replace mode which affects how newly 
typed text affects the existing text. In insert mode, newly typed text is inserted. 
In replace mode, each newly typed character usually replaces an existing 
character. However, in many cases users do not want to replace characters: 
they want to replace words, sentences, or other higher-level objects. In these 
cases, simple replacement is not sufficient since it is unlikely that the new text 
is exactly the same length as the old. The correct effect can be readily achieved 
when insert mode is combined with an operation that defines a region or 
selection that identifies the old text. 
Modes should be made visible. For example, in older calculators, the 
degrees/radians mode was hidden. New calculators have an indicator on the 
display that shows the current mode. Although the mode is still there, the 
indicator reminds the operator that the mode exists and can even guide the 
operator's next input. 
The best way to make the modes visible is to show all state information on 
the display. In this way, it is possible for a knowledgeable end user to predict 
accurately the effect of the next command by examining the current display. 
Of course, not all end users are "knowledgeable," but how could a non-
knowledgeable user ever succeed if a knowledgeable one cannot? 
Note how the reasons for making modes visible dovetail with the reasons 
mentioned earlier for commands having visible effects. 
Use of Language 
DO NOT PRODUCE OUTPUT IN ALL UPPER CASE. UPPER CASE 
IS MORE DIFFICULT TO READ THAN lower case. Proper capitalization 
and punctuation are also important. Would you rather read: 

Guideline Summary 
131 
ENTER CITY STATE AND ZIP CODE: 
or: 
Enter city, state, and zip code: 
Use full words and phrases: do not abbreviate. Displays are large enough 
and output fast enough so that abbreviations are no longer required. 
Prompts should have the form verb object (at least in English). A prompt of: 
Username: 
doesn't tell the user what to do. However, a prompt of: 
Enter your username: 
or even: 
Please enter your username: 
is reasonably unambiguous. In the first case, a user is apt to feel confused and 
unsure of what to do next. (What about a username? Should he or she go get 
one? Whose username?) In the second case, that confusion vanishes. 
Error messages should state whether the operation was performed, why 
something went wrong, and what to do instead. Instead of: 
File write error. 
or (gasp!): 
SIO-FI-ERR-12 
this: 
The file was not written because the disk was full. Clear space 
on the existing disk and try again or write the file to a 
different disk. 
Longer, but much better. 
The application should do what computers do best: arithmetic, checking, 
recording. Users should do what they do best: direct the application to solve 
a problem. Don't make the user count things or keep track of what was done 
in the past. 
Be generous in what you accept. If both Delete and Back Space are used 
for erasing a character, accept both. Unless there is a good reason otherwise, 
don't distinguish between upper and lower-case input. In general, if there is a 
possible way to unambiguously determine what the user wants, accept it. 
Guideline Summary 
This section presents a brief summary of the guidelines already presented. 

132 
9. Command Set Design 
Overall 
• Responsiveness: reflect all input immediately to the display. 
• Consistency: the same input should always have the same result. 
• Permissiveness: the user controls the application. 
• Progress: the user input should achieve the user's goal, not be for the 
application's benefit. 
• Simplicity: keep simple things simple. 
• Uniformity: make the commands easy to learn and to predict. 
• Extensibility: plan for growth and change. 
Modes 
• A void modes where possible. 
• Where modes cannot be avoided, align mode changes with activity 
changes. 
• Remind the user what mode(s) are in effect. 
Use of Language 
• Use mixed case, proper capitalization, and punctuation. 
• Use full words and phrases: do not abbreviate. 
• Prompts should tell the user what to do. 
• Use full error messages. 
• Have the program do what computers do best. 
• Be generous in what you accept. 
Structure Editors 
One idea that keeps recurring is that of a "structure editor." In general, a 
structure editor limits editing to valid transformations on the object being 
edited. They are often used as programming language editors. In those cases, 
there may be a command to "insert an 'if' statement." The user then sees 
something like this: 
if < # > then < > 
else < > 
(This example does not use the C language. In general, people don't do 
structure editors for the C language.) The point is positioned at the "#" 
character and the user is then allowed to make syntactically valid transforma-
tions to continue programming. These editors are often found as the subject 
of research papers. For reasons that will be described, it is fortunate that they 
are not often found anywhere else. 

Programming Assistance 
133 
Of course, the user is in trouble if, for example, he or she decides to negate 
the condition and make the "else" clause into the "then" clause. If the user is 
lucky, there will be an editor command to do this operation. If not, the user 
may have to "cut" the else part and "paste" it into the then. Or worse, the user 
may be forced to delete the else part and retype it at the then. 
It may well be possible to create a structure editor that is also a good editor 
design. However, in all my research I have never seen one. There are two 
reasons why creating such an editor is difficult: 
First, while the structure-oriented operations may be well suited to the 
process of writing a program, they are not well suited to the process of editing 
one. The distinction is a subtle but important one. The examples (usually 
shown in the papers) all show how easy it is to write programs this way. After 
all, it is a nice typing aid to be able to insert many characters of language 
statement with a short command. However, most of the work involved in 
programming is in editing programs that are already written. Editing opera-
tions are often ugly and involve intermediate states that are not valid lan-
guage syntax. It is just in those areas that the structure-oriented operations 
start getting in the way. 
Second, there is no carryover from one part of the editing task to another. 
Sure, it may be easier to write the program, but the task of editing text strings 
and comments to the program has not been addressed by the programming-
language editing commands. The user still needs a full-feature editor to handle 
the string constants, the comments, and other documentation that are an 
integral part of any programming project. By adding the structure editor, 
either a completely separate editor or a complicated new mode has been 
introduced and consistency has been lost. (I will completely skip over the 
question of how to handle the programmer that is editing more than one 
programming language. I will point out that I have worked on projects where 
I have been editing programs written in more than five languages at the same 
time.) 
Note that the arguments just presented address the concept of a structure 
editor, not anyone editor in particular. 
Programing Assistance 
Even if the structure editor approach is not the best, there are still techniques 
that can be used to help write and edit programs. If you like, it could be said 
that these techniques are adapted from structure editors. However, the origins 
of these techniques are lost in the mists of history and no one knows which 
was developed first: structure editors or the adaptations to general editors. 
Typing aids: The first technique is to have commands that serve as typing 
aids. These aids would insert statements or statement parts by typing just a 

134 
9. Command Set Design 
few characters (presumably fewer than the statements or parts themselves!). 
In this way, users gain the "express typing" benefits of structure editors. 
Language modes: Further, a language mode can tailor the effects of com-
mands to suit the characteristics of the language. For example, the commands 
that move by or manipulate words would be adjusted to use language tokens; 
those that use sentences would be adjusted to use language statements; and 
those that use paragraphs would be adjusted to use a statement block or 
procedure. In addition, commands that perform indentation can also be 
modified to handle statement nesting. 
However, these alterations change how commands work and so some 
predictability is lost. In addition, while the alterations would presumably only 
be made for buffers that hold programs, these programs include comments. 
Hence, the commands need to "know" whether they are operating in a 
comment and thus whether to use the altered behavior. Even so, not all users 
are happy with such changes. Hence, there should be a way for users to turn 
them off. (I, for example, prefer to disable all language modes when editing.) 
Syntax checking: Structure editors offer good syntax checking. Most even 
prevent you from creating a syntactically incorrect program. While possible 
to implement, syntax checking is not clearly appropriate for an editor, given 
that a better alternative may be available. This better alternative is for users 
to be able to invoke the compiler from within the editor, and to have the 
editor be able to parse the compiler's error and warning messages. 
Simple syntax checking is a feature that looks useful on the surface, but 
turns out not to be very useful in practice, as good programmers tend to make 
relatively few syntax errors. Syntax checking can catch errors like: 
ovid Foo() 
{ 
return (a -+ b; 
} 
This example has a misspelled keyword, a missing close parenthesis, and 
an illegal operator combination. Syntax checking can catch the last two of 
these, but not the first: at the syntax level, there is no way to tell whether 
"ovid" is a misspelled keyword or a programmer-defined type. 
Semantic checking can catch the "ovid" problem, as well as missing decla-
rations, mis-matched types, and other such problems. With programs spread 
across multiple files, there is simply no way that an editor would be able to 
assemble the information required to perform the correct analysis. It is up to 
the language compiler to perform that function. 
Compiler invocation: And so we bring up the best way for an editor to help 
in program development. That is for the user to quickly and easily be able to 
invoke the compiler and work with the results. The commands might be 
"compile this file," "move to the place indicated by the next error message," 
and so forth. The lesser features such as syntax checking would only be used 
on systems where invoking the compiler is expensive (in user time, not com-
puter power) to do from within the editor. 

Command Behavior 
135 
Command Behavior 
This section describes some of the considerations involved with designing 
some of the commands. As with other parts of the book, the purpose of this 
section is not to say merely "do it this way," but to review why different 
approaches should be considered. 
Does Down Move the Point or the Text? 
Let's say that the point is somewhere in the middle of a large buffer, large 
enough that neither the top or bottom is on the display. The user gives the 
"move down a line" command (say, by pressing the down-arrow key). What 
happens? 
First, the point (and cursor) could both move down one line. The user is 
thinking "I want to move down" and 10, the point moves down. 
A variant on this choice is to move the point down one line, but to move 
the text of the buffer up in the window. This variant has the unfortunate 
property that the cursor is always kept in the center of the window. 
There is another choice. The cursor could stay in the same place, and the 
text of the buffer move down. In effect, this moves the point up one line. 
A moment's thought shows that both choices are indeed valid interpreta-
tions of "down." In fact, both have been implemented many times. All modern 
editors now use the first interpretation. In fact, you might be wondering why 
anyone would select the second interpretation. 
The descriptions just given do not reveal why the two interpretations arose. 
For that information, we have to step from the world of text editing into the 
world of computer graphics. 
Consider the following picture: 
~ ~ 
The quick 
red fox 
jumps over 
the lazy 
user 
display 
buffer 
In this view, the user sees the text on a display. Now let us redraw this 
picture more abstractly: 
~ 
The quick 
~ 
red fox 
u m p s 
jumps over 
the lazy 
user 
window 
buffer 
In this view, the user is "looking through" a window onto the text. The user 

136 
9. Command Set Design 
sees only that part of the text that can be seen through the window. Now the 
question "when the user gives the 'move down one line' command, does the 
command move the window or the text?" makes sense. 
Scrolling vs. Paging 
Closely related to the previous point is whether to scroll or page the screen. 
Again, there are two choices, and again, we are considering the case where the 
user is giving "move down one line" commands. In all cases, the point is 
moving down one line at a time. The question relates to how the cursor moves 
on the screen. 
First, the cursor can move down one line at a time until it reaches the 
bottom of the screen (possibly with a line or so of "guard zone"). Once there, 
the whole screen moves up one "page" and the cursor is re-centered. 
Second, the cursor could stay in the same place on the screen and the text 
could move up by one line. 
The second method offers the advantage that the maximum amount of 
surrounding text is always visible. However, it offers the much more severe 
disadvantage that "just moving around" appears to be constantly changing 
the text. That is quite distracting to users. It also ties what the user sees with 
where the user is making changes. Thus, if the display has a 24-line screen and 
the preferred row is line 10, the user is out of luck if he or she wants to make 
changes while looking at text that is more than 10 lines before the point or 14 
lines after it. 
A third method would be to have the cursor move down to a guard zone, 
then scroll the screen instead of paging it. This method offers better continuity 
than does just paging. It is especially nice if you repeatedly give the "move 
down line" command. Personally, I find it exasperating because your context 
gradually reduces to the size of the guard zone, then stays there. With paging, 
the context is automatically restored to about one-half of the window. When 
using editors that select this method, I have to give the "recenter window" 
command much more often than I like to. 
Page Breaks 
This is more of an issue with word processors than text editors, but it is worth 
mentioning anyway. The problem arises when the program is displaying the 
buffer in its "printed form," including page breaks. It is very tempting for the 
implementor to always position the page break at the top of the display. 
However, it is important that users be able to see the text just before and after 
the page break at the same time. 
How Many Ways Can You Move by a Word? 
When writing commands that operate on words, the first question that arises 
is "what is a word?" We need a definition that is both possible and easy to 
implement. We will approach a definition in a series of refinements. 

Command Behavior 
137 
The first step is to consider all of the characters between white space to be 
one word. With this definition, the sequence: 
This is a very-strange test sentence, isn't it? 
would be considered to be eight words. While a good start, it is not sufficient, 
as the following sequence would be considered only two words: 
here-a phrase 
But this sequence would be considered four words: 
here -
a phrase 
Thus, the next step is to define a word as a string of letters and digits. With 
this definition, the three examples would be considered to have ten, three, and 
three words, respectively. This definition has the advantage that for some-
thing to be considered a word, there should be something "word-like" about 
it (i.e., the characters "-" are not considered to be a word. In addition, the 
presence or absence of extra spaces around the "-" does not change the 
number of words: a good sign that we are on the right track. 
Our refinement can stop right here and be considered acceptable. There are 
some changes that we can make, but these changes are not uniformly consid-
ered improvements. 
The first change is to add some characters to the "word" characters in 
language modes. For example, when writing C programs, the underscore 
character ("_") is legal within a token. By adding this character to the letters 
and digits, a "move by word" command will now properly move by tokens. 
The second change is to add other characters, such as dash ("-") and quote 
('" "). But these are added in a special way: they must be surrounded by letters 
or digits in order to be considered as part of a word. This change allows the 
"very-strange" and "isn't" parts of the sequence to be considered as single 
words. 
However, suppose that you had a very-Iong-hyphenated-phrase. It proba-
bly makes sense to consider this phrase as four separate words. In particular, 
it is better to err on the side of dividing one "word" into two rather than 
combining two "words" into one. For example, in our very-Iong-hyphenated-
phrase, it would be difficult to change the "hyphenate" to "dashed" if word 
motion commands considered the whole thing as one word. 
Moving By Words 
As with many of the other topics here, there are two popular ways of moving 
forward by words. Oddly, though, there is only one popular way of moving 
backwards. 
One way to move forward is to move to the end of the word. For example, 
if we had the text: 
one two three four 
1\ 

138 
9. Command Set Design 
and the cursor was at the "w" (which means that the point is between the "t" 
and the "w"), and a "move forward word" command were given, this move 
would leave the point here: 
one two three four 
A 
i.e.,just before the white space after the word. The other method would move 
the point to the start of the next word: 
one two three four 
A 
When moving backwards, both methods leave the point at the start of the 
word: 
one two three four 
A 
The difference may become slightly more clear if we look at the code that 
might be used to implement these commands. Assuming that the constant 
WORDSTRING contains the characters that comprise a word, the code to 
move backward a word is this: 
Find_FirsLln_Backward(WORDSTRING); 
Find_FirsLNot_ln_Backward(WORDSTRING); 
The code to move forward to the end of the word is the same code, with 
"Backward" changed to "Forward": 
Find_FirsLln_Forward(WORDSTRING); 
Find_FirsLNoLln_Forward(WORDSTRING); 
Finally, the code to move forward to the start of the next word is this: 
Find_FirsLln_Forward(WORDSTRING); 
Find_FirsLNoLln_Forward(WORDSTRING); 
Find_FirsLln_Forward(WORDSTRING); 
The first method, to leave the point at the end of the current word, has the 
property that it is symmetric with respect to backward motion. 
The second method, to leave the point at the start of the following word, 
lacks that symmetry. On the other hand, it makes it easier to move to the 
beginning of the following word. 
The choice is up to you. I strongly prefer the first method. 
Deleting By Words 
This question is "okay, so I have decided what happens when I move by 
words. What should happen when I delete by words?" 
The first answer, which works very well, is simply that you should delete 
whatever the corresponding move command would move over. Thus, if the 

Command Behavior 
139 
motion command were to move to the start of the next word, the deletion 
command should delete that same text. However, consider this case: 
This is some text. 
A 
And, three lines later, more text. 
The "move forward word" command would move to just before the "A". 
However, is it really desirable that the "delete forward word" command delete 
the lines in between, including the row of dashes? Well, yes, if you want to be 
consistent (and predictable). This is one of the reasons why this style of word 
motion is not the best one to use. 
The second answer would be to be "intelligent." This view is used by Apple 
Computer (see Apple 1987). In it, you would change exactly what was deleted 
based on circumstances. For example, with the text: 
Here is some text. 
A 
a "delete forward word" command would delete the word "some" and the 
following space, thus leaving this: 
Here is text. 
A 
instead of this: 
Here is text. 
A 
This definition has the advantage that deleting a word deletes the "support-
ing structure" for the word as well and thus makes the text as if the word was 
never there. It also means that "sloppy" users don't leave stray extra spaces 
around. It has the disadvantage that if you wanted to replace one word with 
a new one-a very common operation-you now have to re-type the space. 
This definition also loses predictability in that only white space is so treated: 
commas, periods, and other punctuation marks are not. So, to replace "old" 
with new in the following text: 
This is an old word. 
A 
you give the "delete forward word" command then type "new", but to do the 
same replacement with the text: 
This is an old, word. 
A 
you give the "delete forward word" command, then simply type "new". Now 
explain that to a user quickly and painlessly. (Note that Apple Human 
Interface Guidelines do not provide for word-level operations other than 
selection.) 

140 
9. Command Set Design 
In all fairness to Apple-and I believe that their guidelines are excellent-
their guidelines are built around a keyboard/mouse combination for user 
input. This book assumes that only a keyboard is available. Changing such a 
basic assumption will result in changing s()me of its conclusions: that is why 
you should make your choices based on a full understanding of the options 
and assumptions that apply in your situation. 
These examples have all operated on full words. The Apple guidelines do 
not have guidelines for how to handle deleting parts of words because the 
guidelines only support whole words as objects. However, you are free to 
invent your own semantics for handling partial words in an "intelligent" 
manner. 
Where Do Sentences and Paragraphs End? 
I will start with the cheery statement that there is no way to correctly 
determine the ends of all possible valid English sentences by analyzing syntax 
alone. Why not? 
Consider these text sequences: 
This is a sentence. 
The value 3.14159 is close to the value of pi. 
The value 3. is close to the value of pi. 
Dr. Martin is a medical doctor. 
I hate typing long words and prefer to abbrev. them. 
We all know that a period is used to end a sentence. The second example 
shows that periods can occur within a sentence. The third shows that periods 
can end a token and yet not end a sentence. The fourth shows that the token 
can be a word. The last shows that you can't just work off a list of known 
abbreviations. When considering these examples, remember that we are ap-
plying semantic knowledge to the statements, something that is beyond the 
ability of most computer programs. From the program's point of view, the 
sequences might as well be: 
Xxxx xx x xxxxxxxx. 
Xxx xxxxx 0.00000 xx xxxxx xx xxx xxxxx xx xx. 
Xxx xxxxx O. xx xxxxx xx xxx xxxxx xx xx. 
Xx. Xxxxxx xx x xxxxxxx xxxxxx. 
X xxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxx xxxxxx xx xxxxxx. xxxx. 
All that said, what is a way out? The definition that I have found that works 
best was worked out by trial-and-error and refined over a period of years is 
this: 
Find_FirsLln_Forward C. 7!:"); 
PoinLMove(1 ); 
Find_FirsLNoLln_ForwardC\" ')] }"); 
if (xiswhite(GeLChar(») (you are at a sentence end); 

Command Behavior 
141 
This definition looks for any of the sentence-ending characters (colons are 
considered to end sentences here). It then skips over any of the characters that 
tend to follow sentence ends. Finally, it checks for white space. 
This definition has the unfortunate property that the last three examples 
are considered to be two sentences each. On the other hand, it has the 
advantage that it works fairly well on non-contrived examples. And, as with 
words, it is better to count one sentence as two than to treat two sentences as 
one. 
Note that only one white-space character (any character of Space, Tab, 
newline, or whatever else you wish to include) is required to end a sentence. 
Depending upon which style manual you follow, either one or two spaces 
should be included after the end of a sentence. However, even if your style 
manual requires two spaces, your users may not use that manual or may 
simply forget to type the extra space. Hence, you should not penalize them 
for the omission. 
I know of one implementation that makes life difficult for its users. Its 
end-of-sentence definition requires two spaces. Yet, when you refill a para-
graph, it removes the second space. Thus, you can move by sentences until 
you first refill the paragraph, after which the entire paragraph is treated as 
one sentence ... 
Paragraph ends are much easier than sentence ends. If you are using word 
wrap, each paragraph will be one line long. Thus, a newline character will end 
a paragraph. Otherwise, a newline followed by any white-space character 
(Space, Tab, newline, etc.) will mark the end of the paragraph. 
If you are fortunate (or unfortunate, it depends on your outlook) enough 
to use a text formatter, you will want to include your formatter-command 
characters as paragraph-break characters. For example, if you are using the 
nroff formatter, you will want a paragraph break here: 
This is some text. 
.LP 
This is some more text. 
So just look for a newline followed by either white space or a dot. 
Moving and deleting by sentences and paragraphs involves all of the same 
problems as moving and deleting by words. See the earlier discussion. 
How to Search 
This topic supplies lots of choices, all of them good. The question is more one 
of how much work you want to put into your implementation than which is 
the correct approach. 
The first choice is between buffered searching and incremental searching. 
Buffered searching means that your implementation prompts for a search 
string, waits for the user to enter the complete string, then performs the 

142 
9. Command Set Design 
search. It works and is easy to implement, but not as good as incremental 
search. 
Incremental search means that the implementation searches as the user 
types. Here is an example: 
user types 
AS 
a 
b 
c 
AH 
what is done 
start incremental search 
find the first "a" 
(1) find the first "ab" 
find the first "abc" 
erase the "c" from the string; go back to where you were after 
(1) 
find the first "abd" 
(2) search again for "abd": you are now at the second one 
search again, you are now at the third one 
get rid of the last A S; go back to where you were after (2) 
You get the idea. The commands available can be as powerful as you like. 
This is clearly a much nicer way to search than buffered searching. Just as 
clearly, it is more work to implement. 
The next question is what the search string should be. The most simple case 
is that the editor should search for the string exactly as typed. Thus, this 
string: 
Some text. 
would match only the string "Some text." in the buffer. While simple, it is not 
necessarily useful. 
The first alternate way to search would be to simply ignore upper and lower 
case. Thus, the string would also match "some text." and "SOME TEXT." 
and "SoMe TeXt." 
Another way to search would be to have lower-case characters in the search 
string match either upper or lower case in the buffer, but an upper-case 
character in the search string match only upper-case characters in the buffer. 
The search string would then match "SOME TEXT." and "SoMe TeXt." but 
not "some text." This way is more useful than one might think, because you 
can enter "ROM" in order to find "ROM" but not the "rom" in "from", yet 
you can still find both "the" and "The" with one search string. 
Another search variation is whole-word match. Thus, one could search for 
"the" without finding "then". In addition, it would be handy to be able to 
allow varying amounts of white space to match. Thus, our "Some text." string 
would match 
Some 
text. 
and 
Some text. 

Command Behavior 
143 
You can get as complex as you like with all of this, up to wild cards and 
UNIX-style regular expressions. Just don't forget to include a way to quote 
any special characters so that the user can search for them exactly. 
Commands to Handle Typos 
There are two very common forms of typographic errors for which special 
commands can be helpful. 
Capitalization Commands 
One typographic error is the incorrect upperj10wer case of a character, part 
of word, or word. Two different forms of commands can be defined to handle 
this task. 
The first form operates as a "move forward word" command, but forcing 
all characters moved over to UPPER, lower, or Capitalized case (the latter is 
first character in upper case, and all others in lower case). Note that three 
separate commands are required. 
The second form is a "rotate case" command. The definition that I use acts 
differently depending upon whether you are within a word or between words. 
In the former case, it affects all characters between the point and the end of 
the word. In the latter case, it affects the entire previous word. In either case, 
it examines the current state of the word and rotates it among word - > 
Word -> WORD -> word, etc. The point is not moved. This definition 
turns out to be very handy. 
Twiddling 
Another typographic error is interchanging two characters. For example, 
"teh" instead of "the". There are three forms of the command to fix this. 
The first form interchanges the two preceding characters. Thus: 
abcd 
A 
becomes 
bacd 
A 
The second form interchanges the two surrounding characters. Thus our 
original becomes: 
acbd 
A 
Neither of the first two forms moves the point. The third form moves the point 
and our original becomes 

144 
9. Command Set Design 
acbd 
1\ 
The advantage to this form is that repeated executions of the command serve 
to "drag" a character along.

Emacs-Type Editors 
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!" 
He chortled in his joy. 
With a thesis subtitle of "A Cookbook for an Emacs" and this book's subtitle 
of "Emacs for Modern Times," it is a safe bet that I would get around to 
discussing Emacs-type editors at some point. And so I have. 
First, I will admit to being biased. I have used Emacs-type editors exclu-
sively for going on fifteen years now (except for a brief stint in durance vile on 
a Macintosh). In addition, I have implemented or worked on implementa-
tions of a half-dozen Emacs-type editors. This chapter will describe what it is 
about an Emacs-type editor that makes it special. 
"What Do You Mean, 'Emacs-type?''' 
This chapter discusses "Emacs-type" editors and not a particular "Emacs" 
editor because, due to its very nature, there isn't one definitive "Emacs" 
editor. The closest that you can come to such a thing is either the original 
Emacs-on-TECO or Gnu-Emacs. 
The Command Set 
The specifics of the Emacs command set will always be shifting and changing. 
Even details on how the basic commands operate will change. However, the 
broad outlines ofthe basic commands are pretty constant, which is to say that 
an editor that does not implement them is not considered to be an Emacs-
type editor. Appendix C lists one Emacs command set and a set of changes 
to it. 
By and large, the Emacs command set follows the design guidelines pre-
sented in the previous chapter. Those places where it falls short are usually 
either physical constraints (there are only a limited number of keys available), 
design compromises (to achieve A one must trade off B), or the ever-present 

146 
10. Emacs-Type Editors 
"historical reasons" (it was a good idea at the time and, while we know better 
now, it is too ingrained to change). All things considered, the Emacs com-
mand set meets the design guidelines better than any other editor that I am 
aware of. 
Some editors never get beyond providing the command set. These editors 
are neither extensible nor provide an extended environment. These limita-
tions may be due to the implementation environment or merely the amount 
of effort that is available to devote to the project. There is a place for such 
editors (they are listed in Appendix B as "command set"). After all, an imple-
mentor should be able to decide to create a small editor without feeling 
obligated to spend years on the project. Given that this decision has been 
made, it is better to use the Emacs command set than any other (at least in 
my opinion). 
The Extended Environment 
Emacs-type editors have been and continue to be used for many things 
besides editing text. Here are some examples. 
Emulation: If you or another user likes a different editor's command set for 
some reason, you can just emulate it in an Emacs-type editor. Thus, you can 
still have all of the power of an Emacs and your favorite command set as well. 
Electronic mail: A text editor can be the primary interface to a mail system. 
Messages can be composed by editing a buffer and can be sent with a 
command. Mail can be read and managed by reading it into a buffer and 
having commands to perform such operations as "move to the next message" 
and "summarize all messages." Having the full power of an editor available 
makes it easy to un-delete an accidentally deleted message or to copy part of 
the text of a message into one's reply. In addition, you have only minimal 
additional learning in order to use the system very effectively. 
Command shell: A text editor can be the primary interface to the operating 
system. Command lines can be edited with the full power of the editor before 
being evaluated. The past record of interaction can be kept and parts of it 
examined or re-used in new command lines. If the operating system does not 
have support for advanced terminals, a display editor can offer its interface 
for use by other programs. Other programs would then take advantage of the 
terminal independence of the editor. Alternatively, other programs would 
insert their output into a buffer and the editor would become an entire 
terminal-management system. This function has been somewhat superseded 
by a window system. But again, why learn two systems when you only need 
to learn one? 
Compilation: A text editor can work closely with a compiler to speed 
turnaround when developing software. 
Debugging: A text editor can be used by a debugger. Multiple buffers and 
mUltiple windows can be used to examine (perhaps multiple) source files, 

Extensibility 
147 
interact with the debugger, and see the output/input of the program as it runs. 
In addition, a debugger might use a window or two to do such things as 
constantly show the values of selected variables. 
File interface: A text editor can be an interface to a complicated file. 
For example, an indexed sequential file can be updated by providing editor 
commands to read and write entries (adding or deleting them can be managed 
as well). The full power of the editor is available for editing the contents ofthe 
entry. 
File system interface: A text editor can provide a smooth interface to the 
file system. A directory can be read by the editor and "edited" by the user. 
Files can be deleted or otherwise changed in a smooth manner by merely 
moving to the file name and giving a command (e.g., "delete"). 
Binary files: A text editor can be used to examine and-when absolutely 
necessary-modify binary files. It can thus replace various patching pro-
grams. 
Again, all of these functions are currently performed by one or more 
Emacs-type editors. The main advantage to building them off of the editor is 
that, even in the absence of such features, most users spend the bulk of their 
time using the text editor (or word processor, etc.). By extending that environ-
ment, only minimal learning is required to use those features. Users are thus 
free to get work done instead of having to spend their time reading manuals. 
This extended environment is one of the hallmarks of an Emacs-type editor. 
Extensibility 
The final hallmark of an Emacs-type editor is extensibility. Emacs was born 
because of the extensibility of its predecessor, TECD. TECD was extensible 
and many of its users took advantage of that extensibility to write their own 
command or change the existing ones. Eventually, one person (Richard Stall-
man) took a large number of those extension packages and created a "stan-
dard" package of Editor MACroS: EMACS. With extensibility in its heritage 
and even in its name, an Emacs-type editor is expected to be extensible. 
Extensibility means, quite simply, that end users can change any of the 
features of the editor. There should be no feature that a sufficiently dedicated 
end user cannot change. This implies that the full source code of the imple-
mentation is available to all end users (and that is why GNU-Emacs is 
distributed under its "Copy Left" policy). 
Now, not every end user will want to recode redisplay. However, the 
principle remains. Most end users will only want to tweak a few parameters 
and maybe "fix" a command or two. That's great and you should encourage 
such changes by making it easy to make them. 
Now that the importance of extensibility has been explained, it is easy to 
see why the Emacs command set cannot be standardized: each user will want 
to change it. In a way, the Emacs command set can be compared to a ball of 

148 
10. Emacs-Type Editors 
mud. You can add more to it, or take some away, and you will still have a 
ball of mud. (Actually, this property is true of most extensible systems.) That 
is also why any comparison between an implementation of an Emacs-type 
editor and any other editor is pointless: the Emacs-type editor can be changed 
(and may already have been) to overcome any shortcoming.

design guidelines listed in the previous chapter. (Easy to Medium)

ments. (Easy)

Epilogue 
'Twas brillig. and the slithy toves 
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves. 
And the morne raths outgrabe. 
And so concludes the verse "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll. A piece of 
nonsense verse embedded in a nonsense work, it resembles the "real world" 
about as much as a computer program does. Which is perhaps why Lewis 
Carroll is so popular among computer programmers. 
And, before you ask, the chapter structure of this book was worked out well 
before the fit of the verse was noticed. Right. 
Questions to Probe Your Understanding 
What parts of "Jabberwocky" fit particularly well with the chapters that they 
lead off? Particularly poorly? (Easy-or is it?) 

Appendix A: 
A Five-Minute Introduction to C 
This Appendix provides a brief introduction to that part of the C program-
ming language as used in the examples presented in this book. This appendix 
is not a reference manual, nor does it describe all of C. Rather, it assumes that 
you are familiar with other programming languages in general and just need 
a nudge or two to follow the examples presented in this book. If you want to 
learn more about the C language, consult ANSI (1990) or Kernighan (1978). 
If you are interested in C, you should also look into the C++ language. 
The best way to think of the C programming language is to consider it as 
providing the programmer with a mechanism for allocating and naming 
memory, control structure, and an extension mechanism. Many people con-
sider it barely a high-level language. Perhaps for that very reason, it is ideally 
suited for systems and utilities such as text editors. 
The declaration mechanism provides the programmer a way to allocate and 
name memory. Data types are oriented around what is best suited to the 
hardware. 
The language statements provide a control structure mechanism. All of the 
usual control structures are available. In addition, a full suite of arithmetic 
and bit operators is available, again focusing around what is best suited to 
the hardware. 
The procedure definition and call mechanism provide the extension mecha-
nism. Many "standard" C operations such as string copy and input/output 
are implemented in terms of this mechanism. 
Comments are enclosed in "/* .. . *f'. 
Case Conventions 
The names in this book follow the convention that UPPERCASE names 
are pre-defined constants, MixedCase names are procedures, and lowercase 
names are variables. Again, these are conventions, not requirements. 

Data Types and Declarations 
151 
Data Types and Declarations 
All variables and procedures used are declared. Declarations are of the fol-
lowing form: 
type variable; 
The language supports the following data types: 
char 
The variable holds one character. Characters are typically 8 bits wide. 
They may either be signed (range -128 to + 127) or unsigned (range 0 to 
255) at the implementation's discretion. 
int 
The variable holds an integer of a size convenient for the hardware. 
This size is typically 16 or 32 bits. 
float 
The variable holds a floating point number. 
FILE * 
The variable holds a file descriptor. 
struct name {list of declarations)}; 
The declarations are combined into a single, 
larger data type named name. 
type (*name)0; 
The name is the address of a procedure that returns a value of type 
type. 
void 
No value. Used to indicate that a procedure does not return anything or 
accepts no arguments. 
A declaration of the form 
type * 
means that the variable holds the address of an object of the specified type. 
The variable is called a pointer to the specified type. A declaration of the form 
type name[constant] 
means that the variable holds an array of objects of the specified data type. 
The array is constant objects object long. The form 
type name [constantl] [constant2] 
is used for a two-dimensional array. 
The following data types are not part of the language, but represent types 
used in examples. An implementation would define these in terms of existing-
language data types. 
FLAG 
status 
location 
time 
private 
The variable holds a True or False value. (In C a 0 value is considered to 
be False and any non-zero value is considered to be True.) 
The variable holds a success or failure status value. This value may 
include warning or error information. 
The variable holds a value that represents a point or mark location within 
a buffer. 
The variable holds a value that represents the time date and time. 
You get to define this. 

152 
Appendix A: A Five-Minute Introduction to C 
Constants 
Integers are written as themselves (e.g., "56" means the value fifty-six). 
Hexadecimal constants are written in the form "Ox # #", where the # # s 
are hexadecimal digits. 
Character strings are enclosed in double quotes (" "). A NUL-terminator 
(a byte of decimal value O) is automatically appended to the string by the 
compiler. Character strings are considered to have the type "array of char." 
Character constants are enclosed in single quotes (' '). They are auto-
matically converted to integers whose value is that of the character. For 
example: 
"a" 
is an array of two characters, consisting of the characters 'a' and NUL 
(values 97 and 0 decimal, assuming ASCII). 
'a' 
is an integer whose value is 97, assuming ASCII. 
while: 
"abc" 
'abc' 
is an array of four characters, consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', and 
NUL (values 97, 98, 99, and 0 decimal, assuming ASCII). 
is officialy undefined (some compilers might consider this as an integer 
whose value is 97 * 65536 + 98 * 256 + 99, but don't count on it). 
The character '\ b' refers to the ASCII Back Space character (8 decimal). 
Note: the ''''/" syntax is used in all code excerpts. However, the normal 
English typographical conventions of using" " are followed in the body of 
the text. 
Pre-defined Constants 
NEWLINE 
NL 
SP 
TAB 
NUL 
The character string that represents a system-specific newline, written 
"\n". 
The character that represents a newline, 10 decimal. 
The space character, 32 decimal. 
The horizontal tab character, 9 decimal. 
The nul character, 0 decimal. Character strings are terminated by this 
character. 
NULL 
The null pointer: no data object can be at this address. 
BUFFERNAMEMAX 
The size ofthe longest possible, buffer name plus 1 for the 
trailing NUL Possibly 33. 
FILENAMEMAX 
The size of the longest possible file name plus 1 for the trailing 
NUL Typically 1,025. 

Statements 
153 
Procedure Structure 
Procedures have the following structure: 
type Name«arguments») 
{ 
<local variables) 
<statements) 
} 
The procedure is named Name and returns data of type type (type can be a 
structure or pointer as well as a basic type). The argument list contains a list 
of declarations or the keyword void if the procedure takes no arguments. The 
local variables are then declared (and may be initialized at each procedure 
invocation). Last are the procedure statements. 
Statements 
The statements are the usual ones. A semi-colon (";") terminates a statement. 
Comments start with "/*" and end with "* /". Statements can be grouped with 
"{" and "}" characters, so the sequence 
{ 
<statement 1) 
<statement 1) 
<statement n) 
} 
is equivalent to one statement. White space and columns are not significant. 
if (condition) then-statement

break; 
continue; 
execute the initializer, then the end-test, then 
repeat the statements, the increment, and end-test 
until the end test becomes True 
exit a loop immediately 
skip the rest of the loop body, but don't exit the 
loop 
while (end-test) statements 
repeat the end-test and statements until the end-
test becomes True

Operators 
repeat the statements forever: a break, continue, 
or return statement is used to exit the loop 
execute the statements after the label whose value 
matches the expression, or the statements after 
"default" if present and no label matches 
return a value from a procedure 
The (possibly unusual) language operators are these: 
assignment; not test for equality 
test for equality; not assignment 
! = 
test for not equal 
logical negation: !FALSE becomes TRUE 
a + b 
returns the sum of a and b 
a - b 
returns the difference of a and b 
a*b 
returns the product of a and b 
ajb 
returns a divided by b 
a%b 
returns a modulo b 
a&b 
returns the bitwise and of a and b 
alb 
returns the bitwise or of a and b 
a 1\ b 
returns the bitwise exclusive or of a and b 
The construct "a @ = b" where "@" is any of the operators" +" through 
""" does the same as "a = a@ b", except that "a" is only evaluated once. 
Operators that return True/False results return 1 for True and 0 for False. 
However, when a True/False value is required (say, in an if-condition), any 
non-zero value means True and zero means False.

fclose«fileptr») closes a file opened earlier with fopen. 
fgets( < buffer), <length), <fileptr») reads one line from a file opened earlier 
with fopen. 
fopen«name), <mode») opens a file for reading. A <mode) of "r" means 
"read-only." 
free«ptr») frees memory previously allocated by malloc. 
isprint«key») returns True if <key) is a printing character or False if not. 
malloc«size») allocates a block of memory at least <size) characters long. 
memmove«to), <from), <length») moves <length) characters from <from) 
to <to), working properly if the areas overlap. 
memset( < start), <char), < length») sets <length) characters starting from 
<start) to the character <char). 
printf( <format») or printf( <format), < arg») copies the characters from the 
format string to the screen "as is" until a '%' character is encountered. The 
sequence "%s" means to take the next argument and send it as a string to the 
screen. The sequence "%c" means to take the next argument and send it as a 
single character to the screen. (The routine does a lot more, but the examples 
in this book don't use the extra functionality.) 
strcpy«to), <from») copy the from string to the to string. 
strlen( <string») returns the number of characters in the string, not counting 
the terminating NUL. 
Non-Standard Library Functions Used in This Book 
Fatal«message») handles a fatal error. 
xiswhite( < c») returns True if the supplies character is a white-space char-
acter (space or tab) or False if not. 
xstrcpy«to), <from») works like the C strcpy routine to copy one string to 
another, but is defined to work properly if the strings overlap. 

Appendix B: 
Emacs Implementations 
This appendix provides a partial-and not comprehensive-list of imple-
mentations of Emacs-type editors. The following information is included for 
each implementation: 
The name line contains the name of the implementation. Implementations 
are listed alphabetically by name. 
The implementation language is the language that the bulk of the implemen-
tation is written in. A compiler or interpreter for this language would be 
needed to use the editor. 
The extension language is the (often custom or modified) language that is 
used when altering or writing extensions to the implementation. It is none if 
there is no extension language. 
The scope is either command set or extensible. In the first case, the imple-
mentation offers a basic Emacs command set; however the user cannot readi-
ly change what the commands do. In the second case, the user can fully 
control what all of the commands do. 
The requirements is a brief characterization of what hardware or software 
is required. The purpose of this item is to offer a broad selection key; not be 
a comprehensive list. You should consult the implementation (for free soft-
ware) or the vendor to find out whether a specific implementation works in 
your environment for example, "IBM PC" is used to cover MS/DOS, OS/2, 
and windows implementations, and "UNIX" refers to any version of UNIX 
from any vendor. 
The organization is the name of and contact information for the imple-
mentor. 
The status is one of 
• no longer available: Self-explanatory. 
• free: The implementation is available to most people at no charge. Even 
such "free" implementations may have restrictions: consult information

Many of the names of the implementations in this list are trademarked. 
Specific trademarks are not called out. 
This list is almost certainly incomplete and will undoubtedly be out-of-date 
by the time that this book is in print. Unfortunately, that is the nature of such 
lists. 
Full source code is available for all of the free implementations. Source 
availability varies among the not-free implementations: check with the ven-
dor before you buy. But first ...

tion. The permission is granted to anyone to make or distribute verbatim 
copies of these sections as received, in any medium, provided that the copy-
right notice and permission notices are preserved, and that the distributor 
grants the recipient permission for further redistribution as permitted by this

What Is the Free Software Foundation? 
The Free Software Foundation is dedicated to eliminating restrictions on 
copying, redistribution, understanding, and modification of computer pro-
grams. We do this by promoting the development and use of free software in 
all areas of computer use. Specifically, we are putting together a complete 
integrated software system named "GNU" (GNU's Not Unix) that will be 
upwardly compatible with Unix. Some large parts of this system are already 
working, and we are distributing them now. 
The word "free" in our name refers to two specific freedoms: first, the 
freedom to copy a program and give it away to your friends and co-workers; 
second, the freedom to change a program as you wish, by having full access 
to source code. Furthermore, you can study the source and learn how such 
programs are written. You may then be able to port it, improve it, and share 
your changes with others. 
Other organizations distribute whatever free software happens to be avail-

160 
Appendix B: Emacs Implementations 
able. By contrast, FSF concentrates on development of new free software, 
working towards a GNU system complete enough to eliminate the need to 
purchase a proprietary system. 
Besides developing GNU, the Foundation has secondary functions: pro-
ducing tapes and printed manuals of GNU software, carrying out distribu-
tion, and accepting gifts to support GNU development. We are tax exempt; 
you can deduct donations to us on your tax returns. Our development effort 
is funded partly from donations and partly from distribution fees. Note that 
the distribution fees purchase just the service of distribution: you never have 
to pay anyone license fees to use GNU software, and you always have the 
freedom to make your copy from a friend's computer at no charge (provided 
your friend is willing). 
The Foundation also maintains a Service Directory: a list of people who 
offer service for pay to users of GNU programs and systems. The Service 
Directory is located in file 'etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution. 
Service can mean answering questions for new users, customizing programs, 
porting to new systems, or anything else. Contact us if you want to be listed 
or wish a copy. 
After we create our programs, we continually update and improve them. 
We release between 2 and 20 updates a year for each program. Doing this 
while developing new programs takes a lot of work, so any donations of 
pertinent source code and documentation, machines, labor, or money are 
always appreciated. 
The board of the Foundation is: Richard Stallman, President; Robert J. 
Chassell, Treasurer; Gerald J. Sussman, Harold Abelson and Leonard H. 
Tower Jr., Directors. 
What Is Copyleft? 
In the previous section entitled "What Is the Free Software Foundation?" we 
state that "you never have to pay anyone license fees to use GNU software, 
and you always have the freedom to make your copy from a friend's computer 
at no charge." What exactly do we mean by this, and how do we make sure 
that it stays true? 
The simplest way to make a program free is to put it in the public domain. 
Then people who get it from sharers can share it with others. But this also 
allows bad citizens to do what they like to do: sell binary-only versions under 
typical don't-share-with-your-neighbor licenses. They would thus enjoy the 
benefits of the freeness of the original program while withholding these bene-
fits from the users. It could easily come about that most users get the program 
this way, and our goal of making the program free for *all* users would have 
been undermined. 
To prevent this from happening, we don't normally place GNU programs 
in the public domain. Instead, we protect them by what we call "copylefts". A 
copyleft is a legal instrument that makes everybody free to copy a program 

Newer Implementations Available for No Charge 
161 
as long as the person getting the copy gets with it the freedom to distribute 
further copies, and the freedom to modify their copy (which means that they 
must get access to the source code). Typical software companies use copy-
rights to take away these freedoms; now software sharers use copylefts to 
preserve these freedoms. 
The copyleft used by the GNU Project is made from a combination of a 
copyright notice and the "GNU General Public License". The copyright 
notice is the usual kind. The General Public License is a copying license which 
basically says that you have the freedoms we want you to have and that you 
can't take these freedoms away from anyone else. (The actual document 
consists of several pages of rather complicated legalbol that our lawyer said 
we needed.) The complete license is included in all GNU source code distribu-
tions and many manuals. We will send you a copy on request. 
We encourage others to copyleft their programs using the General Public 
License; basically programs only need to include a few sentences stating that 
the license applies to them. Specifics on using the License accompany it, so 
refer there for details. 
Obtaining the Software 
If you cannot get the software from a friend or over the network, or if you 
would like to contribute some funds to the Free Software Foundation's efforts 
and receive the latest versions, the Free Software Foundation distributes 
tapes for a copying and distribution fee. Contact them at the above address 
for an order form.

Appendix C: 
The Emacs Command Set 
First, there is no such thing as an "official" Emacs command set. One of the 
main reasons why Emacs-type text editors exist is that each user is free to 
change the commands to suit his or her own tastes. Another reason is that 
there are many different implementations of Emacs editors and each will have 
a slightly different command set. You should consult the documentation that 
comes with your implementation (or the documentation that you write for 
your own implementation) for specifics. 
That said, this appendix will list most of the default command set that 
comes with GNU-Emacs. It will also list my own alterations to these defaults. 
Emacs-type text editors implement the "one-dimensional array of bytes" 
editing model. Line breaks are represented as single Newline characters, 
regardless of the representation used by the operating system. 
Notation 
The first Emacs took advantage of a particular keyboard's features. This 
keyboard allowed you to type all of the normal characters. In addition, both 
Control and Meta keys were available. These keys acted as full Shift keys, 
allowing the user to specify Control- and/or Meta-shifts to any key. For 
example, one could type: 
notation 
key combinations 
5 
5 
% 
Shift-5 
C-5 
Control-5 
C-% 
Control-Shift-5 
M-5 
Meta-5 
M-% 
Meta-Shift-5 
M-C-5 
Meta-Control-5 
M-C-% 
Meta-Control-Shift-5 
The last two could also be written C-M-5 and C-M-%. Most current 
keyboards can only send the usual ASCII characters. That limitation removes 

Default GNU-Emacs Command Set 
173 
the possibility of typing the multiply shifted characters and hence the need for 
the unusual notation. The command sets presented here will thus use the 
familiar caret notation, a copy of which is listed in Appendix E. There are still 
some systems that use extended keyboards like these. The documentation for 
those systems will use the original notation. 
The Escape key (usually labelled "Esc") which sends the escape character 
is used as a prefix to make up for the missing Meta shift key. By convention, 
those keyboards that have an extra shift key (perhaps labelled Meta or Alt) 
can specify meta commands by setting bit 2 A 7 in characters sent from the 
keyboard. 
Emacs commands are, by convention, always upper/lower case-indepen-
dent. Thus, A X B and A X b both refer to the same command. The only 
exception is the "self-insert" command, where B inserts a "B" and b inserts a 
"b". Only the uppercase versions will be listed. 
The terms "S-exp" and "defun," while familiar to Lisp programmers, are 
probably not familiar to others. "S-exp" refers to a parenthesized list and 
"defun" refers to a function definition. Most Emacs language modes remap 
these Lisp-specific commands to comparable commands for other program-
ming languages.

Appendix D: 
The TECO Command Set 
This appendix presents a summary of the MIT TECO editor's command set. 
Should you actually find an ITS or TOPS-20 system and wish to run TECO 
on it, this appendix will be useful but not completely replace the full manual. 
TECO implements the "one-dimensional array of bytes" editing model. 
Line breaks are stored as single newline characters. Large files are divided 
into pages. Pages within a file must be edited in order (i.e., all editing on the 
first page is done, then the second page is read in and edited, etc.). The only 
way to go backwards is to finish editing the file and to start over. On the other 
hand, on most systems, only very large files (over 64 Kilobytes) are split into 
pages. 
Commands are single or double characters. UpperjIower case is ignored. 
The basic forms of commands are "C", "nC" and "n,mC". The first form 
executes command "c" with the default arguments, the second supplies one 
argument of "n", and the third supplies two arguments of "n" and "m". 
Some commands take string arguments. The string consists of all char-
acters after the command up to the terminator character. This character, 
called altmode, is the Escape character, and is written as "$" (for historical 
reasons, of course). 
Commands are accumulated into a command string, until a double altmode 
terminator is entered, at which time the commands are executed. One of the 
altmodes may serve to delimit a string. For example: 
5C$$ 
moves forward five characters, and the command string: 
Ithen$$ 
inserts the string "then", and the string: 
5CIthen$8R$$ 
moves forward five characters, then inserts the string "then", then moves 
backward eight characters. 
TECO also supports the concept of Q-registers. These are variables that 

General Notation 
181 
can either hold numbers or arbitrarily large strings of text. Each Q-register 
can either hold a string or a number and may change back and forth as 
desired. However, it may only hold one or the other at any given time. 
Q-registers are named by single characters. When holding strings, Q-registers 
act just like buffers: you can switch to, insert into, delete from, move around 
in, display, and search in them. Q-register names are either 
• one alphanumeric character preceded by zero, one, or two periods (names 
with two periods are reserved for system variables), 
• a "variable name" of the form $name$ (these are dollar signs, not alt-
modes), 
• a subscripting expression such as :Q(index), 
• a * (for certain commands, it causes them to return their data instead of 
storing it), 
• an expression in parentheses (for certain commands), or 
• up to 3 periods followed by a "R or "" and any ASCII character. 
TECO was first written for PDP-lOs running ITS (the Incompatible Time-
sharing System) and its command set incorporates some knowledge of that 
system's file name syntax. Briefly, an ITS file name has these four parts: 
DEV;DIR:PRTONE PRTTWO 
Each part can be up to 6 characters long and is stored in one 36-bit word. 
Within that word, each character is squeezed into a 6-bit character set, 
so lower-case characters are folded into their upper-case equivalents. The 
operating system and applications programs maintain a default value for 
each of the four parts. For example, if a user specifies a name of "foo", the 
default device, directory, and second part of the file name are automatically 
filled in. Multiple versions of a file are kept by setting the second part of the 
file name to a number. Successive versions are maintained by incrementing 
the number. A second part of "<" refers to the earliest version around. A 
second part of" > " refers to the latest version around (for reading) or one past 
the latest version around (for writing).

characters, if any. If FS CASE$ is non-zero, all characters are 
converted to uppercase (if> 0) or lower case (if < 0) on input. The 
case-shift character causes the next character to be read in the 
other case. The case-lock character temporarily complements the 
preferred case. On output, if FS CASE$ is odd, characters in the 
non-standard case will be preceded by case-shifts. If even, no trans-
lation is done.

Holds the output radix for = and \ . 
Holds the A R secretary macro. Can be used for auto save .

Safety backup copy of .. 0 . 
Names can be up to six characters long. Spaces in names are ignored. Only 
as much of a name as is required to make it unique is required, although 
programs should include the entire name. Saying FSname$ returns the value 
of the flag. Saying nFSname$ or m,nFSname$ sets the value. If a flag can be 
set and you want to use the flag as the second operand of an arithmetic 
operator (e.g., . + FSname$C), enclose the FS in parentheses (. + (FSname$)C). 
These names can never include control characters. The" /\" in some of the 
names is a leading caret. However, the combination usually relates to the 
implied control character.

sponding number. If it is "> " or "<", this value is 0 or - 2, 
respectively. If it is not numeric, this returns -1. if FD D 
FN2$ is numeric, setting this value sets the file name. Other-
wise, the setting is ignored. 
When set to non-zero, causes the display to pause slightly 
between lines of output. 
When set to non-zero, indicates that output has been written 
to the echo area, so the echo area needs to be cleaned up.

for command echoing. 
(Write only) Used for outputs to the echo area. If it has a 
numeric argument, the argument is the ASCII code of a 
character to echo. With a string argument, the string is 
echoed.

(Write only) Return to the innermost error catcher. 
(Write only) Does a .break 16. 
With a numeric argument, converts it from an ITS file date 
to a string of the form "dd/mm/yy hh:mm:ss" and inserts the 
string into the buffer. The form n:FS FDCONVERT$ re-
turns the string. With no argument, reads the string from the 
buffer and converts it to numeric form. 
Is the character used to pad the last word of files. Usually 3 
(AC). 
Is set to non-zero if a - MORE- has been flushed, and thus 
output is being discarded. 
Controls what happens when only one file name is present. 
If this is 0, the file name is used as part two. If > 0, the file 
name is used as part one. If < 0, the file name is used as part 
one and" >" is used for part two. 
(Read only) The length of the gap. 
(Read only) The buffer position of the gap. 
(Read only) The number oflines on the screen.

though a journal file is being replayed. This is how FS JRN 
MACRO$ can work. 
Specifies how often a journal file being recorded is updated 
on disk. The interval is in units of commands. 
This macro is called when a journal file is being replayed 
and TECO encounters a colon or A G in the file. The char-
acter is passed as an argument. In the case of a A G, the 
macro should execute a A R and then quit by doing - 1 FS 
QUIT$. In the case of a colon, this macro should read more 
characters from the file by doing FS JRN READ$ and acting 
upon them. 
(Write only) Opens a journal file for writing (recording). The 
default file names are used. The form :FS JRN OPEN$

Thesis 
This bibliography includes many different types of documents. Some of the documents 
are user manuals for various editors. Others of them describe the implementation of 
specific editors. Still others discuss language tradeoffs or input/output system inter-
faces.

Bibliography 
They are grouped by the type of editor that they refer to. Each entry is annotated 
to help place it in perspective. 
Emacs-Type Editors 
There are four principal implementations of Emacs-type editors, and there are enough 
documents to justify their separate listing.

Other Emacs-Type Text Editors 
This section covers editors which have the same general user interface as an Emacs 
(e.g., screen-oriented, similar key bindings) but are not extensible or otherwise fall 
noticeably short of the Emacs philosophy.
