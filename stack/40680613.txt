 ABSTRACT. The Milky Way Galaxy offers a unique opportunity for testing theories of galaxy formatio
 and evolution. I discuss how large surveys, both photometric and spectroscopic, of Galactic stars are the
 keystones of investigations into such fundamental problems as the merging history - and future - of t
 Galaxy.
 1. INTRODUCTION
 The study of the spatial distribution, kinematics and
 chemical abundances of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy con-
 strains models of disk galaxy formation and evolution. One
 can address specific questions such as
 (i) When was the Galaxy assembled? Is this an ongoing
 process? What was the merging history of the Milky Way?
 (ii) When did star formation occur in what is now "The
 Milky Way Galaxy"? Where did the star formation occur
 then? What was the stellar Initial Mass Function?
 (iii) How much dissipation of energy was there before and
 during the formation of the different stellar components of
 the Galaxy?
 (iv) What are the relationships among the different stellar
 components of the Galaxy?
 (v) Was angular momentum conserved during formation
 of the disk(s) of the Galaxy?
 (vi) What is the shape of the dark halo?
 (vii) Is there dissipative (disk) dark matter?
 These questions are part of larger questions such as
 (a) What was the star-formation rate at high redshift? - in
 this context remember that the oldest stars in the Galaxy
 formed at a lookback time of 10-15 Gyr, or redshifts signifi-
 cantly greater than unity.
 (b) Does light trace mass?
 (c) What determines the Hubble Sequence of galaxies?
 (d) What was the power spectrum of primordial density
 fluctuations?
 (e) What are the values of the cosmological parameters
 Ho and fl0? For example, the length-scale of the Galactic
 disk compared with those of external galaxies constrains Ho ,
 on the presumption that the Milky Way is a typical spiral
 (van der Kruit 1986).
 In this paper I will focus on two (related) questions for
 which large surveys of stars in the Galaxy are crucial,
 namely "what is the shape of the stellar halo?" and "what is
 the merging history of the Milky Way Galaxy?" The shape of
 the stellar halo constrains the shape of the dark halo, espe-
 cially when the spatial data are combined with stellar kine-
 matic data, in addition to containing information about the
 important physical processes during the formation of the
 stellar halo - was there large-scale dissipation of energy dur-
 'Permanent address.
 ing a collapse phase? Are there subcomponents to the halo
 that may indicate accretion and merging? The thick disk of
 the Galaxy may have been formed by a merger event with a
 satellite of perhaps the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud;
 the stars of such accreted satellites may still be identifiable in
 "moving groups." When will the next merger event occur?
 Large multicolor databases such as those soon to be available
 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the APS facility in
 Minnesota will provide necessary input to these problems.
 2. GALAXY FORMATION
 I shall briefly summarize current ideas of galaxy for
 tion and evolution to place Galactic work in context
 e.g., Silk and Wyse 1993 for a more complete review). T
 nature of Dark Matter determines the way in which stru
 forms in the Universe. The popular theory of Cold 
 Matter (CDM; e.g., Blumenthal et al. 1984) predicts that
 first objects to collapse under self-gravity are a small fr
 of the mass of a typical galaxy, so that galaxies for
 clustering and merging of these smaller objects. All de
 fluctuations are initially just gas and dark stuff, and th
 at which stars form is very model-dependent, but feed
 from stars plays a major role in the energy balance. The
 of merging and growth of mass of a protogalaxy c
 estimated by studying the dark matter, which is assume
 be dissipationless and hence to have simpler physics than
 baryonic component, but most probably underestimate
 longevity of individual baryonic structures which wou
 observed as distinct galaxies (e.g., Lacey and Cole 1
 Kauffmann and White 1993; Navarro et al. 1994). Lacey
 Cole (1993) have a particularly vivid schematic represen
 tion of the merging process (their Fig. 6) as a tree, wh
 time increases from top to bottom, and the width o
 branches indicates the mass of a particular halo asso
 with galactic substructure. The final product, the galax
 represented by the single trunk at the ground, and the rel
 thicknesses of branches meeting reflect the mass ratio
 merger. The merging history of a galaxy is then describ
 the shape of the tree. The extremes of morphological t
 may perhaps be the result of merging histories that ar
 scribed by the two types of trees that I, at least, was taugh
 draw as a child - either one main trunk from top to bot
 with many small branches joining the trunk at all heigh
 a fir tree, or a main trunk that splits into two repeatedly,

 like an English oak tree. The latter, dominated by "major
 mergers" or equal mass mergers, may lead to an elliptical
 galaxy. The former, where the merging history is dominated
 by "minor mergers," or very unequal mass mergers with a
 well-defined central core at all times, may lead to a disk
 galaxy. This picture of disk galaxy formation - building up
 by accretion of substructure onto a central core - provides a
 synthesis of elements of the much-discussed and previously
 apparently mutually exclusive "monolithic collapse" para-
 digm of Eggen et al. (1962) and the "chaotic" halo forma-
 tion envisaged by Searle and Zinn (1978). One of the reasons
 for the popularity of CDM is its analytic tractability; Gunn
 (1987) presents an elegant exposition of the formation of the
 Milky Way.
 Constraining the merging history of the Milky Way is of
 obvious importance, as is determination of the star-formation
 history. Aspects of these problems are briefly discussed here.
 3. IS THE STELLAR HALO ROUND, FLAT, BOTH,
 OR MORE COMPLEX?
 Dissipationless Af-body simulations of hierarchical clus-
 tering tend to form flattened, triaxial halos, with mean axial
 ratios of (¿?/fl)~0.64 and (c/a)~0.45 at 50 kpc for a stan-
 dard CDM power spectrum (Dubinski and Carlberg 1991).
 Isopotential surfaces are in general rounder than isodensity
 surfaces - for reasonable axisymmetric potentials at a few
 core radii the ellipticity of the potential contours is only
 about one-third that of the density contours (Binney and
 Tremaine 1987) - and, depending on kinematics, one may
 expect a system of test particles to have an axial ratio that is
 closer to that of the potential rather than that of the gravitat-
 ing density (for example, Binney and May 1986). Thus one
 might expect luminous galaxies to be rounder than their dark
 haloes. Further, the effect of the baryonic component, once it
 dissipates and settles to the center of the potential well, on
 the dark halo will be to decrease its flattening and make it
 more oblate (Katz and Gunn 1991; Dubinski 1994). How-
 ever, one would not expect any component to be spherical.
 Counts of stars in different lines of sight can be used
 fairly directly to obtain an estimate of the shape of the stellar
 halo, although a dependency on models enters through the
 need to isolate halo stars; this is generally attempted by con-
 centrating on blue stars, B- V^0.6. Analyses of Schmidt
 plates to V-20, or distances of une vol ved halo stars from
 the Sun of -5-6 kpc, favor a flattened stellar halo, c/a~0.6
 (Wyse and Gilmore 1989; Larsen and Humphreys 1994).
 Deeper star counts, to V~21, have favored rounder isopho-
 tes, c/a~0.8 (Bahcall and Soneira 1980; Reid and Majewski
 1993). Accurate star-galaxy QSO separation is obviously
 crucial especially for the analysis of faint blue stars. How-
 ever, it may be that there are indeed two components to the
 stellar halo, with the more distant stars being in a rounder
 component. Kinman et al. (1966) found a general increase in
 the flattening of the field RR Lyrae populations with increas-
 ing Galactocentric distance. Hartwick (1987) found that the
 metal-poor, [Fe/H]^ - 1 dex, halo globular clusters and the
 metal-poor RR Lyrae stars both had a spatial distribution that
 was better fit by two components; his inner component,
 which dominates in the solar neighborhood, is flattened
 an axial ratio of ~0.6, while the outer component, dom
 at R^'5 kpc is spherical. Kinman et al. (1994) also f
 evidence for two components, one significantly fla
 which dominates locally and one more spherical, in
 sample of halo blue horizontal branch stars. However, 
 analyses of horizontal branch stars are hampered b
 small number of stars available; studies of unevolved t
 are not in principle.
 The kinematics of the stellar halo provide only a
 constraint on the shape at present, but it is difficult to f
 the local and the distant data simultaneously (Arnold 
 van der Marel 1991). Answering the question of wheth
 not the flattened component to the halo horizontal-br
 stars is rotationally supported requires more data.
 The existence of two components may be evidence t
 the stellar halo formed by a hybrid chaotic/monolith
 lapse process as described in Sec. 2 above (cf. van den B
 1993; Zinn 1993; Norris 1994), or that the stellar h
 locally flattened in response to the disk potential (cf. B
 and May 1986), or perhaps reflects the different orbi
 rameters and internal structure of disrupted satellite g
 that were accreted by the Galaxy to form the stellar 
 (Freeman 1987). Satellite galaxies are slowed in their
 by dynamical friction against the background halo (assu
 their orbit penetrates the mass distribution of the Ga
 depositing orbital energy and angular momentum. The 
 lite galaxy will be tidally shredded as it sinks towards
 Galactic center, essentially losing material with densit
 than the average density of the background Galaxy inte
 the satellite's current position. Thus the internal struct
 the satellite plus its initial orbit determine how much 
 satellite's vertical motion is damped prior to significa
 ruption of the satellite. This is discussed further below
 Thus improved distant samples are required for halo
 nematics and also for chemical abundances to constrain the
 interpretation of the star count analyses, by better isolation of
 "halo" stars. Probably only spectroscopy will allow quanti-
 fication of quasar contamination of representative blue star
 samples (as will be carried out by the Sloan Digital Sky
 Survey), but multicolor photometry combined with measur-
 ing machines such as the APS will suffice for the bulk of the
 stars.
 4. THE THICK DISK AND THE MERGING
 HISTORY OF THE MILKY WAY
 4.1 The Thick Disk
 As discussed briefly above, mergers between galaxies
 and/or galactic substructure are inherent in hierarchical-
 clustering scenarios for the growth of structure in the Uni-
 verse. Since the pioneering work of Toomre (e.g., 1977)
 much effort has gone into study of the effects of both stellar
 and gaseous mergers upon galaxy morphology. The thick
 disk of the Milky Way Galaxy at least morphologically could
 be a minor-merger remnant; provided all the orbital energy
 of an accreted satellite, mass Msat, is available to increase

 the random energies of the stars in a thin disk of mass Mdisk ,
 then after a merger the thin disk will be heated by an amount
 (Ostriker 1990)
 At>random= ^ orbit^ sat ^ disk-
 Of course the internal degrees of freedom of the satellite
 could also be excited and any gas present could, after being
 heated, cool by radiation, so this is a definite upper limit to
 the heating of the disk. This estimate is suggestive, however,
 that the thick disk, which has a vertical velocity dispersion of
 -45 km s~' could be formed from a thin disk with vertical
 dispersion of ~20 km s"1 by accretion of a satellite of about
 10% of the mass of the disk. Note that although there is
 indeed an age-velocity dispersion relationship for stars in
 the thin disk, the value of the vertical velocity dispersion is
 observed to saturate at -20 km s"1 for stars older than a few
 Gyr (e.g., Freeman 1991), which may be understood if the
 heating mechanism responsible is confined to the thin disk
 itself, such as scattering by encounters with giant molecular
 clouds (e.g., reviewed by Lacey 1991).
 Mergers between disks and satellites have been studied by
 Quinn, Hernquist, and collaborators. The most detailed
 Af-body simulation they have published to date (Quinn et al.
 1993) follows the evolution of a satellite galaxy, initially in a
 prograde, circular orbit about a disk of mass ten times that of
 the satellite, with the orbit inclined 30° to the plane of the
 disk, and at a Galactocentric radial distance of six disk scale-
 lengths. Further parameters that need to be specified define
 the internal density profile and kinematics of the satellite,
 and of the disk. The generic evolution is that the satellite's
 vertical motion is damped rather quickly, with a slower radial
 decay to the central regions (displayed very clearly in their
 Fig. 11). The orbital energy is indeed deposited both in the
 disk particles and in the internal degrees of freedom of the
 satellite; the final galaxy has a thick disk which consists of
 both heated thin-disk stars and shredded-satellite stars. The
 mix of these obviously depends on the (many) model param-
 eters, both orbital and internal to the galaxies. Both the radial
 and vertical structures of the disk are altered. The radial heat-
 ing and rearrangement of material by angular-momentum
 transport results in an asymmetric drift (lag behind local cir-
 cular velocity) that is only ~10 km s"1 higher than the initial
 disk. The vertical heating increases the disk scale height by
 about a factor of two.
 How does this compare to the observed thick disk in the
 Milky Way? The scale height is in reasonable agreement
 with star-count analyses. Determination of thick-disk kine-
 matics is complicated by the fact that there is strong overlap
 with the other stellar populations of the Galaxy, and in par-
 ticular the thin disk. The most recent determinations have
 used robust decompositions of the observational data and
 find that the thick disk asymmetric drift is constant with
 height above the plane, at least over 500 pc-2 kpc, and has a
 value of Vlag~50-60 kms"1 (Soubiran 1993; Ojha et al.
 1994), which is not in wonderful agreement with this par-
 ticular simulation. Of course the "standard" merger of Quinn
 et al. is only illustrative.
 The chemical-abundance distribution of the thick disk is
 an obvious discriminant of models of thick-disk formation.
 TIC STRUCTURE AND STELLAR POPULATIONS 787
 For example, in the dissipationless stellar accretion sc
 the thick disk should be a mix of the pre-existing thi
 and the accreted satellite. An alternative picture that c
 duce sufficient heating to explain the thick disk appe
 rare close encounters of thin-disk stars with massive black
 holes in the halo, and predicts that the thick disk should
 contain the same range of chemical abundances as the
 present thin disk (Lacey and Ostriker 1985). The available
 estimates of age for the bulk of the thick disk imply that its
 stars formed early in the evolution of the Galaxy, perhaps at
 the same time as the metal-rich globular clusters (Gilmore et
 al. 1989; Edvardsson et al. 1993), which argues against an
 on-going process of disk thickening.2 This also implies that
 in the merger scenario the chemical-abundance distribution
 of the thick disk should reflect that of the thin disk and
 satellite perhaps 14 Gyr ago. While this is rather model de-
 pendent, studies of the older stars in the present satellites of
 the Milky Way might lead one to expect a metal-poor com-
 ponent to the thick disk, with metallicities ^-1 dex, in ad-
 dition to the contribution from direct heating of the thin disk,
 with [Fe/H]^: - 1 dex. A metal-poor component of the thick
 disk may also be expected if the thick disk/thin disk formed
 with no pre-enrichment (the ejecta from stellar evolution in
 the stellar halo is, due to its low angular momentum per unit
 mass, destined to flow to the central regions of the Galaxy).
 The thick disk is observed to have a well-defined peak
 chemical abundance of ~- 0.6 dex (Gilmore and Wyse
 1985; Carney, et al. 1989; Gilmore et al. 1995) and a fairly
 broad spread, O[Fe/H]~0.3 dex. Metal-poor stars with thick-
 disk kinematics have been reported by Norris et al. (1987)
 and by Morrison et al. (1990) on the basis of DDO photom-
 etry; however as these stars were discovered as part of a
 survey of metal-poor stars, their normalization relative to the
 main thick disk is very uncertain, and may be consistent with
 determinations of the metallicity distribution from unbiased
 surveys with spectroscopic metallicities. Further, the calibra-
 tion of the DDO photometric metallicity estimator has re-
 cently been called into question for just the metallicity,

 and Anthony-Twarog 1994). However,

 stars, which may indicate a physical entity. The hierarchical
 clustering and merging picture of galaxy formation predicts
 that there should be many shredded satellite galaxies for ev-
 ery parent galaxy. Lynden-Bell (1982) noted that the major
 axes of the stellar isophotes of many of the dwarf spheroidal
 companion galaxies to the Milky Way align with their orbits,
 as predicted for galaxies that are being tidally distorted. This
 effect has been nicely illustrated by McGlynn (1990) in his
 Fig. 2c. Since particles which become unbound have low
 positive energies, they thus only slowly drift away from their
 distressed parent galaxy. As discussed in a slightly different
 context by Tremarne (1993), a tidally disrupted object will
 spread out into a tidal stream of length determined by the
 spread in orbital frequency over the size of the object. After

 satellite at which tidal stripping began, /^ternte» *s

 orbit at the galactocentric radius where the satellite was dis-
 rupted. For disruption at 50 kpc, after 1 Gyr the satellite is
 spread out to only four times its original size.
 Satellite galaxies at high Galactic latitude may often be
 found by simply plotting stellar surface density contours pro-
 jected on the sky. For example, the dwarf galaxy discovered
 in the Sextans constellation, latitude ¿7=42.3, by Irwin et al.
 (1990) is clearly seen in their Fig. l(b), which plots all stellar
 objects down to the plate limit (5y~22.5); note the paucity
 of objects classified as stars - the contours plotted start at 1.5
 images/arcmin2 and increase in steps of 0.5 images/arcmin2.
 The dwarf has an angular extent of a degree or so.
 Dwarf galaxies could be hiding at lower latitudes, where
 there is sufficient foreground disk that the over-density of the
 satellite is too small a perturbation to be detected by a simple
 sum of all stellar images. An example of this is the Sagit-
 tarius dwarf, recently discovered (Ibata et al. 1994), as part
 of a survey of the kinematics of the bulge (Ibata and Gilmore
 1995). The dwarf initially manifested itself as a moving
 group, with very distinct kinematics from the bulge, and
 rather localized in angular position. The color-magnitude
 diagram of the field where the moving group is seen kine-
 matically contains a fairly obvious core-helium-burning red
 "clump" (indicative of an intermediate-age population) and
 giant branch, which are not detected in those fields where the
 stars have normal bulge kinematics. Isolating stellar images
 which have the color and apparent magnitude of the clump,
 and plotting isodensity contours of the difference between
 the "moving group" field and an offset field, revealed the
 spatially extended dwarf galaxy (Ibata et al. 1994). The dis-
 tance to the dwarf may be estimated from the clump/HB
 magnitude, resulting in a position ~12 kpc from the Galactic
 center on the other side of the Galaxy, ~5 kpc below the disk
 plane. The dwarf is inferred to be rather massive, similar to
 the Fornax dwarf galaxy, from application of the observed
 luminosity-metallicity relation of the extant satellite galax-
 ies (Caldwell et al. 1992), and from the red clump/giant
 population. At least three globular clusters have kinematics
 and distances that are suggestive of their being physically
 associated with the dwarf galaxy.
 How many of these are there out there? Digital databases
 provide the ideal searching ground to apply optim
 to detect moving groups/satellites.
