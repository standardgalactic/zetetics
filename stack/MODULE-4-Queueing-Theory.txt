UNIT - 5:  Queuing Theory 
(By Dr.NVR Naidu, Prof & HOD (IEM), MSRIT, Bangalore) 
 
The Basic structure of queuing model 
Introduction  
Queues are a part of everyday life. We all wait in queues to buy a movie ticket, to make bank 
deposit, pay for groceries, mail a package, obtain a food in a cafeteria, to have ride in an 
amusement park and have become adjustment to wait but still get annoyed by unusually long 
waits. 
The Queuing models are very helpful for determining how to operate a queuing system in the 
most effective way if too much service capacity to operate the system involves excessive costs. 
The models enable finding an appropriate balance between the cost of service and the amount 
of waiting.

Therefore, the equivalent assumption is that they generate according to exponential 
distribution between     consecutive arrivals. To solve the problems use & assume customer 
population  as  ∞ 
(b) Queue Discipline 
 
A queue is characterized by maximum permissible number of units that it contains. 
Queues are called finite or infinite, according to whether number is finite or infinite. The service 
discipline refers to the order in which number of queues are selected for service. 
  
Ex: It may be FIFO, random or priority; FIFO is usually assumed unless stated otherwise.  
(c) Service mechanism  
 
This consists of one or more service facilities each of which contains one or more 
parallel service channel. If there is more than one service facility, the arrival unit may receive 
the service from a sequence of service channels.  
 
At a given facility, the arrival enters at the service facility and is completely served by that 
server. The time elapsed from the commencement of the service to its completion for an unit at 
the service facility is known as service time usually, service time follows as exponential 
distribution. 
Classification of queuing models using kendal & Lee notations 
Generally, any queuing models may be completely specified in the following symbolic form 
 
 
 
a / b/ c  :  d / e 
a      
Type of distribution of inter – arrival time  
b      
Type of distribution of inter – service time  
c      
Number of servers  
d      
Capacity of the system  
e      
Queue discipline  
M     
Arrival time follows Poisson distribution and  
         service time follows an exponential distribution.

(a) Expected fraction of the day that the phone will be in use. 
(b) Expected number of units in the queue Expected waiting time in the queue. 
(c)  Expected number of units in the system.  
(e) Expected waiting time in the system 
(f) Expected number of units in queue that from time to time. 
(g) What is the probability that an arrival will have to wait in queue for service? 
(h) What is the probability that exactly 3 units are in system 
(i) What is the probability that an arrival will not have to wait in queue for service? 
(j)  What is the probability that there are 3 or more units in the system? 
(k)  What is the probability that an arrival will have to wait more than 6 min in queue for 
service? 
(l)  What is the probability that more than 5 units in system 
(m) What is the probability that an arrival will have to wait more than 8 min in system?  
(n) Telephone company will install a second booth when convinced that an arrival would have 
to wait for attest 6 min in queue for phone. By how much the flow of arrival is increased in 
order to justify a second booth.  
Solution: 
The mean arrival rate = λ = 1/8 x 60 = 7.5 / hour. 
The mean service = µ =     x 60 = 15 / hour.

6) A departmental Secretary receive an average of 8 job / hr. many are short jobs, while other 
are quiet long. Assume however, that the time to perform a job has an ED  mean of 6mins 
determine  
a) The average elapsed time from the time the secretary receives a job, until it is completed.       
 
                                                                                                              (0.5) 
b) Average number of jobs in a system                                                           (4) 
c) The probability that the time in the system is greater than ½hr.  (0.3621)                                 
d) Probability of more than 5 jobs in the system.                                 (0.2628)     
 
   Solution 
Mean arrival rate = λ =  8 jobs / hrs 
Mean service rate = µ =          x 60 
                                    = 10 jobs / hrs.

13) Arrivals of machinist at a tool crib are considered to be P.D at an average rate of 6/hr. the 
length of time the machinist must remain at the tool crib is ED with an average time being 0,05

14) Jobs arrive at an inspection station according  to Poisson process at a mean rate of 2/hr and 
are inspect one at a time on a FIFO basis. The quality control engineer both inspects and makes 
minor adjustments. The total service time for the job appears to be ED with a mean of 25mins. 
Jobs that arrive but cannot be inspected immediately by the engineer must be stored until the 
engineer is free to take them. Each job requires 1 sq mts space determine

15) The arrival of aircraft at an international tends to follow a Poisson fashion, in spite of 
schedule flight time, due to high operating variability in the schedule time. It can be assumed 
that the aircraft arrives at an average rate of 6/hr. The landing service is provided through a 
single runway by a control tower according to ED with an average service time of 6mins/flight:

4) A bank has 2 tellers working on saving accounts. The 1st tellers handles withdrawal's only and 
the 2nd teller handles deposits only, it has been found that service time distribution for 
depositors and withdrawal's.  Both are E.D with a mean service time of 3min /customer. 
Depositor are found to arrive in a Poisson fashion with a arrival rate of 16/hr and withdrawal's 
also drive in a Poisson with a mean rate of 14/hr. 
 What would be the effect on the average waiting time for the depositors and withdrawal's if 
each teller would handle both withdrawal's and deposits. What would be the effect if the time 
would only be accomplished by increasing the service time to 3.5mins.

By increasing the service time from 3 to 3.5 min the waiting time in the queue for the 
depositors is decreased from 0.2 to 0.19hrs. 
But in the case of withdrawal's the waiting time in the queue increased from 0.116hrs to 
0.19hrs

(e) How many hours each week a tax advisor spends performing his job.  
(f) Probability that a customer has to wait before he gets service.  
(g) Expected number of idle tax advisors at any specified time
