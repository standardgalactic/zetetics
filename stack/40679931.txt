 ABSTRACT. We investigate the available kinematic constraints on the ellipticity of the Galactic disk.
 In the solar neighborhood the only suggestion for nonaxisymmetry is an anomalous value for the ratio
 of tangential to radial-velocity dispersions. This can be explained by postulating that the Galactic disk
 is slightly elliptical, and that the Sun lies near a symmetry axis of the disk. The observed asymmetries
 of the large-scale gas distribution in the Galaxy are also briefly discussed.
 1. INTRODUCTION
 It is now generally believed that disk galaxies are sur-
 rounded by massive unseen halos. If the halo is the domi-
 nant source for the gravitational potential (as is probably
 true at large radii, and maybe also closer in), the shapes of
 the orbits are related to that of the halo potential: gener-
 ally, if the potential in the plane of the disk is not axisym-
 metric, the orbits, and hence the disk, will not be circular.
 In particular, a weak elliptical distortion of the potential
 will cause the disk to become slightly elliptical too.
 If halos form through dissipationless collapse of random
 density fluctuations in the early universe, few of them
 should be round; rather, a typical galactic halo is expected
 to be a quite prolate, triaxial object (Dubinski and Carl-
 berg 1991). While this result leaves out the effects of the
 dissipational (gaseous) portion of the collapsing galaxy,
 which may well have a major influence on the shape of the
 final product (Katz and Gunn 1991), nonetheless it is in-
 teresting to investigate the effect of nonspherical halo po-
 tentials on the shapes of disk galaxies embedded in them.
 In this paper, we will examine the Milky Way for non-
 axisymmetry. After establishing some notation in Sec. 2,
 we will concentrate on the two basic kinds of kinematic
 observations with which we can test whether the Galaxy is
 axisymmetric:
 (i) The kinematics in the solar neighborhood may not
 have the symmetries expected for an axisymmetric galaxy.
 We will discuss the possibilities that the Oort constants C
 and K may be nonzero (Sec. 3), that the local standard of
 rest may have a component of velocity along the Sun-
 Galactic Center line (Sec. 4), and that the velocity ellip-
 soid may show a vertex deviation (Sec. 5) or an anomalous
 axis ratio (Sec. 6).
 (ii) The large-scale motions in the Galaxy may not be
 symmetric about zero galactic longitude. This possibility
 will be discussed briefly in Sec. 7.

 the data that went into the compilations, the reader is re-
 ferred to Kuijken and Tremaine ( 1991 ) (hereafter referred

 representative either of the Galaxy as a whole, or of its
 central regions. We gathered a variety of such measure-
 ments from the literature, for objects quite close to the
 center of the Galaxy as well as the globular clusters. (We
 do not include CO observations in this list, since the CO
 distribution in the central few 100 pc is highly nonuniform,
 making it a doubtful refence frame. At face value, CO data
 suggest that the LSR recedes from the Galactic center at
 ~14 kms"1.) The combined result of these measure-
 ments,
 Sä,lsr=-1±9 kms"1, (4)
 shows no evidence for nonaxisymmetry, as in Eq. (3).
 Note, though, that absence of evidence is not evidence of
 absence, since on an axis of symmetry of the potential
 y/?,LSR is always zero.
 5. VERTEX DEVIATION
 The random motions about the mean streaming velocity
 also contain information about the potential. To describe
 these, we define the velocity dispersion tensor cr.
 = (vi-vi)(Vj-Vj). This tensor has orthogonal principal
 axes: we define the vertex deviation lv as the longitude to
 which the longest axis points, so that
 tan(2U = -2 °R+ . (5)
 Provided that the velocity dispersions and nonaxisymme-
 tries are small (so that third moments of the velocity dis-
 tribution may be neglected), it is possible to derive a rela-
 tion between the velocity dispersion components and the
 streaming motions in the disk. In Cartesian coordinates,
 we have (e.g., Borderies et al. 1983)
 <rij,t+<rik Vj,k+ajk Vi,k+<rij,k vk=0. (6)
 We convert this expression into polar coordinates and lin-
 earize about the axisymmetric state:
 Vr=09 !;,=i;dre(J?), aR+=09 --=-
 URR zycirc
 (7)
 This last expression is a consequence of the epicycle ap-
 proximation (see e.g., Binney and Tremarne 1987), and
 will be discussed further below. After some algebra, we end
 up with expressions for the perturbed velocity dispersion
 components as functions of the velocity field. The full ex-
 pressions are presented in KT, Eqs. (19) and (27). With
 these, we study the vertex deviation (discussed in Sec. 6)
 and the ratio cf^/(^rr to be discussed in Sec. 6. As an
 example, in the case of a potential ^M = v20'n Ix1 + (y/q)1,
 with 6^=1- <7<1, we have
 l^-ley sin 2<f>. (8)
 This illustrates the general result that /y, like C, K, and
 v~RLSR, is only nonzero away from a symmetry axis of the
 potential.
 Interpreting measured vertex deviations is complicated
 by the fact that young, low-velocity-dispersion populations
 of stars can easily show a vertex deviation as a result of
 spiral structure, or of incomplete mixing around their or-
 bits since their formation; in order to study the large-scale
 shape of the potential, it is therefore necessary to restrict
 one's attention to kinematically hotter stars. Available data
 for populations with 0RR> 30 km s"1 give
 /y=5.5±4.2°. (9)
 Here, too, little or no evidence for n

 vations tend to find a ratio of 0.4, smaller than 
 tion for a flat rotation curve. This puzzling d
 may be the result of nonaxisymmetry: e.g., th
 tential that led to the vertex deviation in Eq. 
 ^=i(l + 3€l|, cos 2<f>).

 7. LARGE-SCALE ASYMMETRY
 Apart from the kinematics of the solar neighborh
 stars, we can also check data on distant objects for 
 dence of nonaxisymmetry. For instance, axisymmetry 
 plies that the kinematics of objects observed at the 
 distance in the Galactic plane towards directions / and 
 should be equivalent: the only difference should be the
 of the velocity down the line of sight (hereafter referr

 GALACTIC DISK 811
 H I gas in the same direction shows an extended wing of
 emission approaching us! Further study of this region
 would be desirable.
 The only other disk tracer available that can be ob-
 served at large distances is gas. Here we have the funda-
 mental problem that distances cannot, in general, be deter-
 mined independently, but rather need to be derived from a
 model of the velocity field. This makes it rather hard to
 measure the velocity field! However, we can make some
 progress by looking for systematic differences between pos-
 itive and negative galactic longitudes. In particular, the
 velocities at the "tangent points" (edges to the H I velocity
 profiles corresponding to gas inside the solar orbit moving
 directly along the line of sight) and the outer "edge" of the
 Galaxy (the furthest gas that can be seen to some flux
 limit) may be compared. For an extensive discussion of
 such investigations, see Blitz and Spergel (1991) and Ku-
 ijken (1991); we summarize the main results here.
 If the velocity field is written as a circular flow with a
 single Fourier mode perturbation,
 7R = €a(R)sin[m(l)-Ç(t)],
 (11)
 v+=varc(R)+€ß(R)co&[mt-C{t)]
 (as would arise from a cos[m$ - £(£)] perturbation to a
 circular potential if Ç(t)=œt, for constant frequency co),
 then the asymmetry in the tangent point velocities is
 At;tgt = 2esin £[/?(*tgt)sin m(90°- |/| )-a(Ä0)cos /],
 (12)
 and that in the edge velocities is
 Auedge=2e sin Ç[a(Redge) ( - 1 )m+1 cos ml-a(R0)cos /] .
 (13)
 Note that both these asymmetries disappear on a symmetry
 axis of the perturbation (where sin£=0), and that they
 may be a reflection of either a radial motion of the LSR
 (which gives a cos/ term), or of a perturbation in the
 distant gas observed (which results in an wth-order har-
 monic Au).
 The observed tangent point velocities show some small
 asymmetries, which cannot be understood as resulting
 from a large-scale nonaxisymmetry, but may be consistent
 with spiral structure or other small-scale perturbations in
 the gas. The outer edge of the Galaxy appears to lie at
 systematically different velocities at positive and negative
 longitudes, with, approximately
 Ai;edgei-30cos/. (14)
 Unfortunately, this is the one case where Eq. (13) does not
 unambiguously distinguish radial motion of the LSR from
 perturbations in the distant gas! There are at least three
 possible explanations for this observation, none of them
 totally satisfactory:
 (1) The model put forward by Blitz and Spergel
 (1991), in which the LSR moves outwards at 14 km s"1,
 and the outer gas moves more or less on circular orbits.
 This model is marginally consistent with the stellar kine-
 matic data reviewed in Sees. 3-5 (predictions are C=2
 km s"1 kpc"1, *=0.4 km s"1 kpc"1, lv= -9.3°- it makes
 no prediction for the axis ratio of the velocity
 but an axisymmetric model fits these data better
 (2) An alternative is to maintain zero radial m
 the LSR, as indicated by the stellar observation
 Then the outer gas must be suffering an m = 
 distortion, as is quite commonly seen in othe
 (Baldwin et al. 1980). However, the asymmetr
 spatial densities seem to suggest an m - 2 rathe
 m = 1 distortion, though this measurement may b
 by spiral structure near the Sun.
 (3) It is possible that the outer regions of the g

 8. CONCLUSIONS
 We have examined the kinematics of the solar neig
 hood for signs of large-scale nonaxisymmetry of 
 lactic disk. We find little or no evidence for nonaxis
 try: only the ratio of tangential to radial-vel
 dispersions is lower than expected for a circular expo
 tial disk with a flat rotation curve. If the Galactic p
 is slightly elliptical, with the sun near the short axi
 result can be explained. It would be very difficult to
 this ellipticity on large scales, because from our p
 near the symmetry axis the Galaxy would still loo
 metric about the Galactic center.
 We briefly discussed large-scale asymmetries observed
 in the H I gas, and concluded that no single model is able
 to account for them satisfactorily. As is hinted at by the
 irregular shape of the Galactic warp at large radii, the
 outer gas may not be in equilibrium, which would preclude
 its use as a probe of the halo potential.
