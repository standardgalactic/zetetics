Balmer Series
The Balmer series is a sequence of emission lines in the spectrum of
atomic hydrogen that terminate in the level with nf ¼ 2 and start in the
levels with ni ¼ 3, 4,. . .. Many of the lines lie in the visible region.
Their wavenumbers are proportional to 1/4 – 1/ni
2. See hydrogenic
atom.
Band Theory
When each of N atoms of an element contributes one atomic
orbital to the formation of a molecular orbital, the resulting N
molecular orbitals form an almost continuous band of levels when
N is large. The lowest energy molecular orbital of the band is
fully bonding between all neighbours; the highest energy mole-
cular orbital of the band is antibonding between all neighbours
(Figure B.1). If the atomic orbitals are s orbitals, then they form
an s-band. If the atomic orbitals are in p orbitals then they form a
p-band. In a typical case there is so large an energy diﬀerence be-
tween the s and p atomic orbitals that the resulting s- and p-bands
are separated by a band gap of width Eg. In certain cases, the
symmetry of the crystal results in the formation of a band gap even
though the s and p orbitals are so close in energy that the resulting
bands are expected to overlap. In this case, the bands mix to form
hybrid bands.

Electrons occupy orbitals in the band in accord with the Pauli
principle. If insuﬃcient electrons are available to fill a band, the
result is a conduction band; the electrons at and close to the highest
occupied level of the band are mobile and the solid is classified as a
metallic conductor. The highest occupied orbital at T ¼ 0 is called
the Fermi level. Only the electrons close to the highest occupied
level of the band contribute to the conduction; also, only they
contribute to the heat capacity. If the band is full, then the elec-
trons cannot transport the current and the solid is formally a
semiconductor, its electrical conduction arising from electrons that
have been thermally excited across the band gap. If the band gap is
so large that few electrons populate an upper almost empty band,
then conduction is negligible and the solid is regarded as an
electrical insulator. The details of the temperature dependence of
the population of the bands is expressed by the Fermi–Dirac
distribution.
bar (the unit)
The unit of pressure 1 bar is defined as 105 Pa exactly. Note that
1 atm ¼ 1.101 325 bar exactly, so 1 bar is about 1 per cent smaller than
1 atm. The bar is used in the current definition of standard state.
Barometric Formula
The barometric formula is an expression for the variation of the
pressure of the atmosphere with altitude, h, on the assumption that

p(h) ¼ p(0)egMh=RT
where p(0) is the pressure at sea level, g is the acceleration of free fall,

ance is made for the weak variation of g with altitude, the formula

Base
An Arrhenius base is a compound that, when dissolved in water,
generates OH ions. A Brønsted base is a proton acceptor. The conju-
gate base of an acid HA is the base A formed by proton loss from HA.
A strong base is a Brønsted base that is eﬀectively fully protonated in
solution. A weak base is a Brønsted base that is only partly protonated
at normal concentrations in solution. The stronger the base, the
weaker is its conjugate acid. A base is weak if Kbo1 and usually
Kb{1. A Lewis base is an electron-pair donor. A hard base is a Lewis
base that tends to bond strongly to a hard acid and a soft base is a
Lewis base that tends to bond strongly to a soft acid. Hard acid–hard
base combinations are largely ionic and soft acid–soft base combin-
ations are largely covalent.
Basicity Constant
The basicity constant (also called the base ionization constant and less
appropriately the base dissociation constant), Kb, of a Brønsted base is
a measure of its ability to accept a proton from water. It is defined as
B(aq) þ H2O(l) " HBþ(aq) þ OH(aq);
Kb ¼ aHBþaOH
aB
;
pKb ¼  log Kb
where aJ is the activity of J. A small value of Kb indicates a weak
base. In elementary applications, the activities that occur in Kb are
replaced by [ J]/c- where [ J] is the molar concentration of J and
c- ¼ 1 mol dm3:

Note that the larger the value of pKb, the weaker is the base. Modern
tabulations of data typically report the pKa of the conjugate acid of B.
The two quantities are related by
pKa þ pKb ¼ pKw
where Kw is the autoprotolysis constant of water, with pKw ¼ 14.01 at
25 8C. It follows that the higher the pKa of the conjugate acid, the
lower is the value of pKb and therefore the stronger is the base.
Basis Set
In molecular orbital theory a basis set is the set of atomic orbitals from
which the molecular orbitals are constructed as a linear combination.
In general, the larger the basis set, the more accurate is the molecular
orbital. In group theory, a basis is the set of entities to which a
symmetry transformation is applied when forming a representation of
a group. In this context, the number of entities used is called the
dimension of the representation.
Beer–Lambert Law
The Beer–Lambert law (commonly simply ‘Beer’s law’) is an empirical
expression for the variation of the intensity of electromagnetic radi-
ation passing through an absorbing medium:
log I
I0
¼  e[J]L
where I0 is the incident intensity, I is the intensity after passing
through a sample of length L, and [J] is the molar concentration of an
absorbing species J (note the common, base 10, logarithm). The
quantity e is the molar absorption coeﬃcient (formerly: extinction
coeﬃcient) of J at the frequency of the incident radiation. The
dimensionless quantity A ¼ e[J]L is called the absorbance (formerly:
optical density) of the sample. The ratio T ¼ I/I0 is the transmittance of
the sample. The integrated absorption coeﬃcient, A, is the area under
a graph of the molar absorption coeﬃcient plotted against the
wavenumber:
A ¼

Band
e(~n)d~n
It is a measure of the total absorption intensity of the band.

sorption isotherm that takes into account the possibility that ad-
sorption can proceed beyond a monolayer:
V

In this expression p* is the vapour pressure above an adsorbed layer
that is more than one layer deep, Vmon is the volume of adsorbate
corresponding to monolayer coverage (measured, like the adsorbed
volume V, under stated conditions, such as STP), and c is an empirical
constant which is large if the enthalpy of desorption from a mono-
layer is large compared with the enthalpy of vaporization from a bulk
liquid (Figure B.2).
Bijvoet Method
The Bijvoet method is a technique in X-ray crystallography for
the determination of the absolute configuration of a compound
by making use of the phase shift in the scattered radiation as
the X-rays approach an absorption frequency of the compound.

Birefringence
A sample is birefringent if it has diﬀerent refractive indices for light
of diﬀerent polarizations. It is linearly birefringent if it has diﬀerent
refractive indices for linearly (plane) polarized light; it is circularly
birefringent if it has diﬀerent refractive indices for left- and right-
circularly polarized light (nr,L and nr,R, respectively). A circularly
birefringent material is optically active and rotates the plane of lin-
early polarized light by the angle
Dy ¼ (nr;R  nr;L) 2pL
l
where L is the path length through the sample, and l is the wave-
length of the radiation in the medium.
Black-body Radiation
Black-body radiation is electromagnetic radiation that is in thermal
equilibrium with matter at a temperature T. A black body is a material that
can absorb or emit without favouring any wavelength. The characteristics
of black-body radiation are summarized by the following two laws:
Wien displacement law: The temperature and wavelength of the ra-
diation of maximum intensity satisfy the relation lT ¼ constant,
with the empirical value of the constant equal to 28 mm K.
Stefan–Boltzmann law concerns the temperature dependence of the
excitance, M, the power emitted divided by the area, and states that
M ¼ sT4, where s is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, with the
empirical value 57 nW m2 K4.
The properties of black-body radiation are fully accounted for by the
theory proposed by Max Planck in 1900 in which he supposed that
electromagnetic oscillators of frequency v can possess only energies of
integral multiples of hv, where h is Planck’s constant. Its current defined
value is h¼ 6.626 070 15 1034 J s exactly. The Planck distribution for
the spectral density is
r(l) ¼ 8phc
l5
ehc=lkT
1  ehc=lkT ;
dE(l) ¼ r(l)dl
where dEðlÞ is the energy density of radiation with wavelengths be-
tween l and l þ dl (Figure B.3).

The equivalent expression for the spectral density in terms of
frequency is
r(n) ¼ 8phn3
c3
ehn=kT
1  ehn=kT ;
dE(n) ¼ r(n)dn
It follows from the Planck distribution that the constant in Wien’s law

c2 ¼ hc
k ¼ 1:439 cm K
and that the Stefan–Boltzmann constant is
s ¼ 2p5k4
15h3c2 ¼ 56:704 nW m2 K4
Bohr Frequency Condition
The Bohr frequency condition states the frequency, n, of radiation emitted
or absorbed when an atom makes a transition between two states that
diﬀer in energy by DE is hn ¼ DE (more precisely, hn ¼ |DE|). The basis
of this expression is the conservation of energy when a photon of energy
hv is generated or absorbed.

The energy of an electron with magnetic quantum number ml in a
magnetic field of flux density B in the z-direction is Eml ¼ mlmBB. See
magnetogyric ratio.
Bohr Radius
The Bohr radius, a0, is defined as
a0 ¼ 4pe0ˉh2
e2me
;
a0E52:917 pm
This length originally occurred in Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom
as the radius of the lowest energy orbit (more precisely, that radius is
a ¼ (me/m)a0, where m is the reduced mass of the nucleus/electron
system). In the quantum mechanical description, a0/Z (more pre-
cisely, a/Z) is the most probable distance from the nucleus at which
the electron will be found when a hydrogenic atom of atomic number
Z is in its ground state.
Boiling Temperature
The boiling temperature of a substance is the temperature at which its
vapour pressure is equal to the ambient pressure. The normal boiling
point is the temperature at which the vapour pressure is 1 atm. The
standard boiling point is the temperature at which the vapour pressure
is 1 bar. Boiling is characterized by by the formation of bubbles of
vapour throughout the liquid.
Boltzmann Distribution
The Boltzmann distribution expresses the population of a state of en-
ergy ei at a temperature T as
Ni ¼ N eei=kT
q
;
q ¼
X
i
eei=kT
where N is the total number of molecules, k is Boltzmann’s constant,
and q is the partition function. This expression is often used in a
simpler form, as the ratio of the populations of two states of energy ei
and ej:
Ni
Nj
¼ e(ei  ej)=kT

When using this expression it is important to take into account the
possibility that a level is degenerate, and that each of the g states of
that level is occupied equally. Then the relative populations of the
levels, as distinct from individual states, is
NI
NJ
¼ gI
gJ
e(eI  eJ)=kT
where I and J now label the levels rather than the individual states.
Note that the Boltzmann distribution implies that the entire popu-
lation is in the lowest level at T ¼ 0 and that the population of all
states is the same as T -N. The origin of the distribution is the
random scattering of populations over the available states subject to
the requirement that the total energy has a certain value. See
ensemble.
Boltzmann’s Constant
Boltzmann’s constant, k, is the fundamental constant that relates the
population of a state to the temperature by way of the Boltzmann
distribution. It has the defined value k ¼ 1.380 649  1023 J K1.
The constant occurs wherever the Boltzmann distribution is im-
plicitly present, which includes the statistical definition of en-
tropy, the equipartition of energy, and the properties of a perfect
gas. It often appears in disguise as the gas constant R ¼ NAk, so R is
eﬀectively the molar Boltzmann’s constant. This relation accounts
for the appearance of R in a number of expressions that have
nothing to do with gases, such as the Nernst equation for the cell
potential.
Bond Dissociation Energy
The bond dissociation energy, hc ~D0 (with ~D0 a wavenumber), is the
minimum energy required to dissociate a bond from the vibrational
ground state of a molecule. It diﬀers from the energy minimum of
the molecular potential energy curve by the zero-point energy
(Figure B.4). It can be identified with the change in internal
energy at T ¼ 0. The closely related thermodynamic property is
the bond dissociation enthalpy, DH(AB), which is the molar
enthalpy change accompanying the process AB(g) - A(g) þ B(g).
This quantity diﬀers from the dissociation energy itself in part

because the process refers to a distribution over the available states
at the stated temperature (DUm(T)oDUm(0) ¼ hc ~D0) and on account
of the diﬀerence between enthalpy and internal energy. Thus,

thalpy. The equilibrium bond length, Re, is the distance between the
nuclei of neighbouring atoms in a bond for the vibrational ground
state.
Bond Order
The bond order, b, of a diatomic molecule or a diatomic fragment of a
polyatomic molecule is defined as b ¼ 1
2 (n  n ), where n is the num-
ber of electrons in bonding orbitals and n* the number in anti-
bonding orbitals. The bond order correlates with a number of
molecular properties. Thus, for a given pair of atoms, the bond length
decreases, the bond dissociation energy increases, the force constant
increases as the bond order between them increases.
Bonding Orbital
A bonding orbital is a molecular orbital which, if occupied, lowers the
energy of a molecule. It is often convenient to focus on pairs of
neighbouring atoms in a molecule and to regard the orbital as
bonding if there is no internuclear nodal plane and antibonding if
there is an internuclear nodal plane (Figure B.5). The bonding char-
acter is commonly ascribed to the accumulation of electron density
between two atoms as a result of the constructive overlap of atomic
orbitals.

vacuum into a solvent of relative permeability er:

where r is the ionic radius and z its charge number. The expression

and for solvents of high relative permeability.

thalpy changes.
Born Interpretation
The Born interpretation of a wavefunction c(r) is that c*(r)c(r) is
proportional to the probability density for finding a particle at the
location r, and therefore that c*(r)c(r)dt is proportional to the
probability of finding the particle in the infinitesimal region dt at r. In
each case, the proportionality becomes an equality if the wavefunction is
normalized to 1. The implication is that c(r) itself is a probability
amplitude. The curve and the shading of the band in Figure B.7 depict
the probability density in this instance.
Born–Oppenheimer Approximation
According to the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, the distribution of
electrons in molecule can be calculated by supposing that the nuclei
are in fixed locations.
Boson
A boson is a particle with integral spin quantum number (including 0).
Examples include the photon (spin 1), a helium-4 nucleus (spin 0),
and a deuterium nucleus (spin 1). The Pauli principle requires their
wavefunction to be unchanged under the exchange of identical pairs.
As a result, the Pauli exclusion principle does not apply, and any
number of bosons can occupy the same state. Bosons are the

conveyors of forces between fermions, so matter can be regarded as
fermions bound together by the exchange of bosons.
Boundary Conditions
The general solution of a first-order diﬀerential equation has one
undetermined constant; that of a second-order diﬀerential equation
has two. These constants are determined by ensuring that the solu-
tions have certain values at the boundaries of the system, such as at
an impenetrable wall or at a great distance (Figure B.8). These values
are the boundary conditions, and ensure that only some of the general
solutions are acceptable. If one of the variables of a diﬀerential
equation is time, the related constraint is called an initial condition,
and sets the value of the solution at t ¼ 0.
In chemistry, boundary conditions are imposed on solutions of
the Schrödinger equation and the diﬀusion equation; initial conditions
typically apply to the diﬀerential equations known as rate laws in
chemical kinetics. The boundary conditions of the Schrödinger equa-
tion are typically related to the values of the wavefunction at the
physical boundaries of the system (including the behaviour of wave-
functions at infinity), or, in certain systems, cyclic boundary conditions,
the requirement that wavefunctions replicate themselves after a
rotation of 2p (Figure B.9). Examples of the former are the requirement
that c ¼ 0 at the walls of a particle in a box, and examples of the latter

at the requirement that c(f þ 2p) ¼ c(f) for a particle ion a ring. That
boundary conditions lead to the selection of only a discrete set of so-
lutions of the Schrödinger equation accounts for the quantization of its
dynamical properties, specifically its energy and, for systems with cir-
cular symmetry, its angular momentum.
Boundary Surface
A boundary surface is a notional surface that captures a specified prob-
ability of finding an electron in an atom or molecule. An isodensity
surface is a surface of constant probability density (Figure B.10). Each
type of atomic orbital has a characteristic boundary surface (commonly
represented as either an isodensity surface or more notionally by a
shape that approximates to an isodensity surface), and those shapes,
particularly their symmetry, is the basis of qualitative discussions of
atomic and molecular structure.
Bragg’s Law
Bragg’s law is the relation between the glancing angle, 2y, and the
separation, d, of the planes of a crystal responsible for the diﬀraction
of X-rays (Figure B.11):

It is common to regard the nth order {hkl} diﬀraction as arising from
the {nh nk nl} planes of the crystal. In the Bragg method, a single crystal
is rotated in a beam of monochromatic X-rays, and the glancing
angles corresponding to diﬀraction spots recorded.
Branch
A branch of the vibrational spectrum of a gas-phase molecule consists
of lines arising from the simultaneous excitation of rotational tran-
sitions when a vibrational transition is excited. In general, an infrared
spectrum consists of three branches (Figure B.12). The P-branch
consists of all lines with D J ¼ 1, the Q-branch with D J ¼ 0, and the
R-branch with D J ¼ þ1. The energies (neglecting centrifugal distortion
and the variation of the rotational constant with rotational state), are
vP(J) ¼ v  2BJ; vQ(J) ¼ v; vR( J) ¼ v þ 2B( J þ 1)
In vibrational Raman spectra there is an O-branch, arising from
D J ¼ 2, a Q-branch, and an S-branch, arising from D J ¼ þ2. Their
frequencies are
vO( J) ¼ v  2B(2J  1); vQ( J) ¼ v; vR( J) ¼ v þ 2B(2J þ 3)

The lattices are classified according to the crystal system to which
they correspond together with a specification of the location of the
lattice points. A primitive lattice (P) has lattice points only at the vertices
of the cell, a body-centred lattice (I) also has a lattice point at the centre,
and a face-centred lattice (F) has lattice points at the vertices and at the
centre of each face. In two cases (orthorhombic C and monoclinic C),
there are points at the vertices and on only two opposite faces.

is generated by fast electrons decelerating as they plunge into a
metal.
Buﬀer Solution
A buﬀer solution is an aqueous solution that is resistant to changes in
pH on the addition of a strong acid or strong base. It consists of a
solution of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its
conjugate acid. The former is an acid buﬀer, and stabilizes solutions
at pHo7. The latter is a base buﬀer, and stabilizes at pH47. A buﬀer
is typically most eﬀective in the range pH ¼ pKa  1.
Building-up Principle
The building-up principle (or Aufbau principle) aims to generate the
ground-state electron configuration of an atom. For an atom of atomic
number Z, the Z electrons are allowed to occupy the available orbitals in
order of increasing energy subject to the requirement of the Pauli
exclusion principle that no more than two electrons can occupy any
given orbital. When more that one orbital of the same energy is avail-
able, electrons enter each one separately and do so with parallel spins.
Broadly speaking, the order of occupation of orbitals is the order of their
energies after taking into account penetration and shielding. However,
in some cases small adjustments are necessary in order to ensure that
the final configuration is the one of lowest total energy. Thus, in
the d-block, the lowest energy is obtained in certain cases by trans-
ferring an s-electron into a d orbital, especially if that results in a full or
half-full d-subshell. Analogous adjustments occur in the f-block.
The electron configuration of a cation is obtained by removing an
electron from the last-filled orbital of the parent atom: p-electrons are
removed first, then s-electrons, and finally the requisite number
of d-electrons. The configurations of chemically significant anions are
obtained by completing the p-subshell.

where a is the transfer coeﬃcient and j0 is the exchange current density.
The transfer coeﬃcient indicates the formal location of the transition
state on the reaction coordinate: a ¼ 0 indicated that the transition
state is reactant-like, lying close to the outer plane of the electric
double layer, and a ¼ 1 indicating that the transition state is product-
like and lying close to the inner plane. The exchange current density
is the current density in either direction when Z ¼ 0. Electrodes with
low exchange current densities are classified as polarizable; those with
high exchange current densities are classified as non-polarizable.
A current of electrons towards the electrode is termed anodic; in the
opposite direction it is termed cathodic.
The Butler–Volmer equation is often expressed in one of two limits.
In the low overpotential limit, with Zf{1, jEj0fZ. In this limit the
current density is proportional to the overpotential, and the electrode
is termed ohmic (as it behaves according to Ohm’s law). In the high
overpotential limit, with Zfc1, ln jEafZ. A Tafel plot is a plot of ln j
against overpotential (Figure B.14). The slope of the plot is a and the
extrapolated intercept at Z ¼ 0 gives ln j0.
