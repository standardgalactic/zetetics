 
 Transcribing the Sound of English
 
 Do you have a fear of transcription? Are you daunted by the prospect of learning 
and handling unfamiliar symbols? Th is workbook is for students who are new to 
linguistics and phonetics, and off ers a didactic approach to the study and transcription 
of the words, rhythm and intonation of English. It can be used independently or 
in class and covers all the pronunciation details of words, phrases, rhythm and 
intonation. Progress is deliberately gentle with plenty of explanations, examples 
and ‘can’t go wrong’ exercises. In addition, there is an associated website with audio 
recordings of authentic speech, which provide back-up throughout. Th e audio clips 
also introduce students to variations in accents, with eleven diff erent speakers. Going 
beyond the transcription of words, the book also ventures into real discourse with the 
simplifi cation systems of colloquial English speech, rhythm and intonation.

 Introduction
 
 Transcribing the Sound of English is not so much a coursebook in phonetics 
nor a textbook on English phonology, but a training course in developing stu-
dents’ powers of observation on features of English pronunciation and their 
skills in recording them in writing. It begins in a very elementary way but it 
is thorough, and eventually leads to the most comprehensive coverage of the 
sounds of English from words to full discourse that is available anywhere. It is 
designed for both native and non-native speakers of English, and for that latter 
reason all of the material is available in audio form. Every single word and all 
the discourses that are presented in Transcribing the Sound of English have 
been recorded and are available at www.cambridge.org/tench. Every single 
example with a reference number in the left -hand margin of this book is found 
with that same reference on that website.
If you are new to the subject, start at the beginning of Part I and do Chapters 
1, 2 and 3 about transcribing words. You are introduced to broad transcription 
in a very gentle way, with plenty of practice material – so much, in fact, that a 
skilful, confi dent student could actually skip some of it, but there is enough to 
provide a less confi dent student with plenty of practice to build up their confi -
dence. Th ere is no key to this practice material, because you cannot go wrong! 
Th ere are, however, quick tests (kwűk tsts) at strategic points, and for them 
a key is provided on the same website. By the end of Chapter 3, you should be 
able to transcribe a word like homogeneous without any diffi  culty.
You could then choose to ignore Chapter 4 if you do not need to get into 
narrow transcription. You could also ignore Chapter 5 on accents if desired. 
Th ese two chapters are more advanced and are written in a more academic 
style. But you could return to them later.
It would be good to do Chapter 6 on phrases, which returns to a more gentle 
approach in broad transcription. It introduces you to features of pronuncia-
tion that may not be immediately obvious when words come together and 
aff ect each other. But it only takes a little refl ection to see what quite naturally 
happens in your own ordinary, informal speech.
Part II takes you on from words and phrases to full discourse with its 
rhythm and intonation systems. Chapter 7 shows the eff ect of rhythm in utter-
ances, especially in terms of the so-called weak forms of words in context. It 
is closed with three whole discourses, monologues, which are carefully graded 
with guidance to help you to listen out for things, but that guidance becomes 
progressively less explicit until you no longer need it.

Introduction
Th e fi nal Chapters 8 to 12 on intonation are a thorough and comprehensive 
introduction to transcribing the important features of intonation.
Th ere is a convention that when spoken discourse is transcribed it is done 
so in ordinary orthography; and this convention is accepted here. It should be 
noted that much of the spoken data in sociolinguistics literature has very poor 
systems for recording intonation and its eff ect in the development of discourse, 
and these fi nal chapters will gradually introduce you to the intonation systems 
themselves in real, genuine instances of talk that were recorded for other pur-
poses than intonation transcription. Intonation is there whenever we talk, and 
it is oft en the most crucial element in the communication process. So you get 
to handle intonation in actual talk, not in simulated exercises.
Th ese chapters could be taken as a separate task from the rest of this book. 
Th ey present a full description of intonation, but they do so in such a way that 
you build up both your knowledge and your skill in transcription. Th ere are 
occasional references to new trends which are not always dealt with in text-
books on English intonation. Again, there is an emphasis on intonation in real 
discourse; you will listen to real people talking in real situations, not in simu-
lated exercises.
You will see that the exercises in Chapters 8 to 12 do not have a key. Th is 
is because you are introduced to real dialogues where you have to decide on 
matters of tonality fi rst and then on matters of tonicity and then of tone and 
paratones. As you move from one chapter to another, the ‘key’ is given you 
in every following chapter. So, for example, you are asked to decide on the 
tonality of dialogues in Chapter 8 before you move on to tonicity in Chapter 9; 
and when you come to work on tonicity, you will fi nd that the tonality of the 
dialogue is presented to you, because you cannot really decide on matters of 
tonicity until the tonality has been recognized. And so it goes on, step by step 
through to Chapter 12, until you have reached a full and complete analysis and 
transcription.
So you get the chance to learn and practise and then produce whole tran-
scriptions with confi dence, from simple words to whole discourses, all in one 
workbook!

I Words . . .
 
 Why transcribe?
 
 It is an unfortunate feature of the English language, that the way its words 
are spelt does not always match the way its words are pronounced, in the 
simple and systematic way of other languages. For instance, in most accents of 
English, the letter <a> is not pronounced the same in the two words tall and 
tally; and although the two words tally and ally are spelt alike, they are not 
pronounced alike – they do not rhyme. Th ere are, in fact, two sides to this mis-
matching of spelling and pronunciation: a single vowel letter of the alphabet 
can represent at least two vowel sounds; and a single vowel sound can be rep-
resented by at least two diff erent spellings. Another example is the double <o> 
in brood and brook – two diff erent vowel sounds, but the same spelling; and 
brood (what birds do) and brewed (past tense of the verb brew) – two diff er-
ent spellings, but the same vowel sound. In fact, it is not too diffi  cult to think 
of ten ways of pronouncing the use of the letter <a> in spelling, and ten ways 
of pronouncing each of the other vowel letters. Equally, it is not too diffi  cult 
to think of ten ways of spelling most of the vowel sounds. Th is represents an 
enormous task for a child learning to read and write in English as their mother 
tongue, and similarly, a tricky task for those who learn English as an additional 
language.
Th is mismatching is found amongst consonants too. Th e letter <t> in rat 
and ration represent very diff erent consonant sounds; double <s> occurs in 
both pass and passion, but whereas passion and ration rhyme, their identical 
‘sh’ sound is spelt diff erently. Have you noticed that the fi rst double <s> in 
the word possess is pronounced diff erently from its second double <s>, and 
that the second double <s> of the word possession is diff erent again? Th e vari-
ation amongst consonant letters and consonant sounds is not as great and as 
mystifying as it is amongst vowel letters and sounds, but it certainly adds to 
the impression of an unhelpful, perhaps even an unnecessary, complication in 
the matching up of spelling and pronunciation of words in English. You know, 
too, that oft en consonant letters represent nothing in pronunciation, like the 
<b> in debt, the <c> in muscle, the <d> in handkerchief, etc. But there is also the 
case of a consonant sound not being spelt at all: if you compare the pronuncia-
tion of the beginning of the two words youthful and useful, you will notice that 
the ‘y’ sound is spelt with the letter <y> in the fi rst word, but is not spelt at all 

4
PART ONE
Words
in the second; compare view and few too, where the ‘y’ sound is spelt with the 
letter <i> in view, but not in few.
Th us it is no wonder that learners have problems with English spelling and 
with deducing the pronunciation of words from their written form. Th ese 
problems persist into later life and even well-educated professional people 
make many mistakes. So it is also no wonder that professionals in education 
have sought to remedy the situation by various means, including propos-
als for spelling reform on the one hand, and special reading schemes like 
phonics and the phonographic method on the other. But what is needed is 
an understanding of the very pronunciation system of English itself which 
the spelling system obscures. Th is need is met in the application of linguis-
tics, or, more precisely, in those parts of linguistics known as phonology and 
phonetics. Phonology refers to pronunciation as a system in itself – how 
many vowels there are in the spoken form of the language (not the fi ve vowel 
letters), and how many consonants there are, where the sounds can occur 
in words, what combination of sounds are allowed, etc. Phonetics refers to 
the pronunciation of the sounds themselves – how they are made, how they 
diff er, how they sound in diff erent positions of a word and how they sound in 
diff erent combinations, etc. And for the study of the pronunciation of words 
in English, an extra set of symbols is needed to extend the use of the letters 
of the alphabet.
Th e use of such phonetic symbols, as they are usually called, facilitates the 
representation of the pronunciation of any language, not just those which have 
a ‘diffi  cult’ relationship with spelling like English, French, Irish, etc. Even if 
there is a good correspondence between pronunciation and spelling as in lan-
guages like Spanish, Welsh, Finnish, etc., an international set of symbols is 
helpful in comparing languages and learning them. As you make your way 
through this workbook, you will also see that detailed diff erences can be repre-
sented when transcribing diff erent accents and colloquial styles.
Th e ‘angle’ brackets, <t>, enclose letters of the alphabet. Whole words in 
ordinary spelling which are used as examples are in italics. ‘Slant’ brackets, 
/t/, enclose phonetic symbols in broad transcription, i.e. phonemes; whole 
words in broad transcription are also enclosed in ‘slant’ brackets, e.g. /rt/ rat. 
‘Square’ brackets, [t], enclose phonetic symbols in narrow transcription, i.e. 
allophones (see Chapter 4).
Chapters 1 to 3 are based on a type of accent that used to be known as 
Received Pronunciation. But this term is no longer transparent in meaning, and 
so the more explicit label Southern England Standard Pronunciation (SESP) is 
used. It also used to be known as BBC English, but the BBC now has a much 
more open policy on accents even for their main newsreaders, and of course 
other channels may well use newsreaders who speak with the SESP. Th is accent 
is ‘standard’ simply in the observation that it is recognized as a form of pro-
nunciation that is typically used by those who professionally engage in public 
speech, people like newsreaders. But a newsreader in Scotland is not likely to 
use SESP, but a Scottish standard of pronunciation; similarly newsreaders in 

5
Why transcribe?
  
Wales, Ireland, USA, Canada, etc. are most likely to use standard pronuncia-
tions that are appropriate in their settings.
Th ere is no intrinsic ‘value’ in SESP or, for that matter, in General American 
(GA). However, SESP is the standard form of pronunciation that is presented 
in most descriptions of English pronunciation published in UK, while GA is 
the standard form presented in USA. Th erefore, for simple practical reasons, 
SESP has been chosen as a starting point, but with occasional comments on 
well-known variations in other accents.

1 Vowels
 
 Th e vowels off er the greatest problem, so we will start there. Th e vowel system 
of English is relatively large. Latin had fi ve vowels, hence the fi ve vowel letters 
in our Roman alphabet; a modern form of Latin, Spanish, has also only fi ve, 
Italian has seven, but English has at least twenty. Listen to the following English 
names and note that each has a diff erent vowel sound:
 
1.1 Steve, Jim, Jen, Pat, Mark, John, George, Brook, Sue, Chuck, Bert, Jane, Joe, Di, 
Joy, Ian, Claire, Noor
 
 Th at’s eighteen diff erent vowel sounds already; then add to those, the two 
vowel sounds in
Howard,
 
 and the vowels at the beginning of
Fiona and Louise.
 
 And so the relatively large size of the vowel system of English can begin to 
be appreciated. All these diff erent vowel sounds can be used to distinguish 
 ordinary words too of course, such as
 
1.2 peat, pit, pet, pat, part, pot, port, put, putt, pert, pout . . .
 
 and thus they have a contrastive function. By virtue of this contrastive function, 
we can be sure that all these vowel sounds are distinct items, or units, in the pho-
nology of English – that is, in English pronunciation as a system. And because 
they are distinct, linguists need to have a separate symbol for each of them.
Th e phonetic description of the vowel sounds – that is, the way they are pro-
nounced – helps us to classify them all into groups. Th ere are three important 
groupings: the short vowels, the long vowels, and the weak vowels. Each will be 
dealt with in turn, beginning with the six short vowels.
 
The short vowels
 
 Th e 6 short vowels can be found in the following words:
 
1.3 lick, leg, lack, lock, look, luck
 
 Th ey have two main features: one is that they are, phonetically, shorter than 
the other vowels, as we shall see when we introduce the long vowels; the other 

7
CHAPTER 1
Vowels
is that they are, phonologically, never able to appear at the end of a word in 
English – they must always be followed by a consonant. So, by introducing the 
short vowels fi rst, we shall also have to practise the use of some of the consonant 
symbols. Some of the letters of the alphabet function also as phonetic symbols, 
such as b, d, f, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, z – all with their common English 
values. (Note that // represents the initial sound in get, not that of gem.)
Th e symbols we will use are all authorized by the IPA, the International 
Phonetic Association, and can be used to represent the sounds of any language 
in the world. But please note that you must write them as printed, e.g. as /f/, 
not  ; as /z/, not  , etc.
Now, the fi rst short vowel that we listed was in the word
 
1.4 lick
 
 that vowel is represented by a symbol that looks like a small capital < I >; lick is 
transcribed as
l i k
 
 Notice that the <ck> at the end of the word represents a single sound, and so 
only a single phonetic symbol, /k/, is required. Transcribe all these words too 
that rhyme with lick making sure that you write a /k/ all by itself at the end:
 
1.5 pick, tick, kick, nick, wick, trick, slick, stick
 
 Write them on the line below
 _______________________________________________
 
 One of these words could have been a name –
 
1.6 Nick
 
 Th e name Nick, and the common noun, nick, are pronounced in exactly the 
same way despite the use of the capital <N>; because they are pronounced 
the same, they must be transcribed the same: /n i k/. It would be phonetically 
incorrect to use a capital letter in a name as a phonetic symbol in a case like 
this. Notice also that the name, Nick, could also be spelt Nic or Nik, but because 
this makes no diff erence to the pronunciation, it makes no diff erence to the 
transcription either. So, nick, Nick, Nic and Nik are all transcribed as /n i k/. 
(Because they are pronounced the same, despite their diff erent spellings, the 
words are called homophones.)
 
 Now, transcribe these other names, making sure you do not use any capital 
letters as phonetic symbols
 
1.7 Mick, Dick, Rick, Vic, Tim, Phil
 _______________________________________________
 
 Here are some more words with the same vowel sound, to give you practice 
with the symbol /i/.

PART ONE
Words
 
1.8 pip, bib, did, kid, gig, fi t, trip, slit, fi lm, trim
 _______________________________________________
 
 And now try these
 
1.9 licks, sticks, kicks, tricks, wicks, slicks
 _______________________________________________
 
 Notice that they rhyme with the following names with apostrophe <’s >:
 
1.10 Nick’s, Dick’s, Rick’s, Vic’s, Mick’s
 _______________________________________________
 
 Th e apostrophe must not be included in the transcription, because it is not 
pronounced. And notice, too, that
 
1.11 Mick’s and mix
 
 are homophones – they are pronounced the same, and so should be transcribed 
the same: /miks/. Transcribe
 
1.12 six, fi x, mix  ________________________________
 
 You could also now transcribe the word
 
1.13 quick
 
 using only the symbols introduced so far: /kwik/. Try:
 
1.14 quip, quit, quid, quiz, quill, quilt, squint, liquid, quick fi x
 _______________________________________________
 
 You could also transcribe the word
 
1.15 knit
 
 noting that the initial <k> is not pronounced and so is not transcribed: /nit/ 
(knit and nit are homophones). Transcribe the following words in which, in 
each case, a letter is silent
 
1.16 wrist, biscuit, snippet, ticket, wicket
 _______________________________________________
 
 Remember that /k/ is used whatever the spelling for the /k/ sound; so, click is 
/klik/. Th en transcribe
 
1.17 crick, cricket, crib, crypt, script, clips, victim
 _______________________________________________
 
1.18 Vic prints Nik’s scripts  _______________________
 
1.19 Kim nicks Philip’s biscuits  ____________________

CHAPTER 1
Vowels
 
1.20 Six miss Rick’s fi lm  __________________________
 
 In this practice with the fi rst short vowel, we have also actually illustrated a 
number of rules of good transcriptional practice:
 
 
1  A unit of sound in the phonological system of a language (known techni-
cally as a phoneme) must be represented by a single symbol, whatever 
variations may occur in spelling; e.g. <k, c, ck, q(u)> and an element of 
<x> all represent the one English consonant phoneme /k/.
 
 
2  Capital letters are not used for English phonemes; since <n> and <N> 
(etc.) are pronounced identically, they must be represented by a single 
symbol, e.g. /n/.
 
 
3  Homophones – pairs (or sets) of words with the same pronunciation 
despite diff erent spellings – must be transcribed with the same symbols, 
e.g. Mick’s, mix.
 
 
4  Th e apostrophe must not be transcribed, since it is not pronounced: 
Mick’s = /m i k s/ ; Philip’s = /f i l i p s/.
 
 
5  A single letter may represent two phonemes in transcription; each of 
those phonemes requires its own symbol; e.g. <x> (in six) = /ks/.
 
 
6  A double letter may represent a single phoneme; in transcription that 
single phoneme must be represented by a single symbol; e.g. <ss> in miss 
= /m i s/ ; <pp> in snippet = /s n i p i t/.
 
 
7  A letter may be redundant as far as pronunciation is concerned: if a letter 
represents ‘silence’, it must not have a corresponding symbol in the tran-
scription of a word, e.g. <w> in wrist = /r i s t/.
 
 
8  Word spaces are retained as in orthography, even when there is no 
‘space’, or silence, in pronunciation. Note that the phrase snip it is pro-
nounced identically to the single word snippet. However, word spaces are 
preserved to aid reading: /snip it/.
 
 A few more rules will need to be added in due course.
 
 
*
 
 Th e second short vowel that we listed occurred in the word
 
1.21 leg
 
 Th at vowel is represented by an IPA symbol that looks like the Greek letter 
<ε>, (epsilon). So leg is transcribed as
l ε g
 
 Some dictionaries use the ordinary Roman letter <e>, because it has a 
more familiar look; however, in IPA, <e> represents the sound in the German 
word

10
PART ONE
Words
 
1.22 Tee
 
 and the French word thé, Italian té, Welsh tê; or in many an English accent a 
word like lake. Th at vowel sound is distinctly diff erent from the vowel in leg. 
Compare another pair of words: the word late in many English accents is pro-
nounced:
 
1.23 ‘late’
 
 compared to let. So, for comparative purposes, when, for instance, compar-
ing the vowels of English and another language, or the vowels of two diff erent 
accents of English, we need to keep the ordinary Roman letter <e> as the IPA 
symbol for the /e/ sound, and rely on the Greek letter epsilon, <ε>, as the IPA 
symbol for the /ε/ sound. Th us, egg is /ε/.
 
 Using the symbol /ε/, now transcribe
 
1.24 peg, beg, keg  _______________________________
 
 and
 
1.25 pet, net, debt, well, tent, send, kept, crept, twelve
 _______________________________________________
 
 and the names
 
1.26 Ben, Greg, Kent, Meg, Rex, Brett  _______________
 
 Th e vowel sound /ε/ is spelt in various ways including <ea>. Transcribe
 
1.27 head, dead, dealt, meant  ______________________
 
 and the homophones
 
1.28 bread and bred, and wrecks and Rex  _____________
 
 Ate, the past tense of eat, in a British accent is usually
 
1.29 /εt/
 
 Now transcribe
 
1.30 friend and said  _____________________________
 
1.31 Fred kept twelve tents  _______________________
 
1.32 Ted said ten; Ed meant twelve  _________________
 
1.33 Did Meg wed Denis  _________________________
 
1.34 Meg kept Denis in debt  ______________________
 
1.35 Did Tim edit Phil’s fi lm script  _________________
 
1.36 Ed will edit it  ______________________________

CHAPTER 1
Vowels
 
 Now try the word extent, remembering not to use the <x> letter. Th e fi rst <e> 
is either /ε/ or /i/
 
1.37 /ε k s t ε n t/, or /i k s t ε n t/
 
 Now transcribe
 
1.38 expend, excel, excess, except, expect, extensive, expensive, excessive, expressive
 _______________________________________________
 
 How do you pronounce the word exit:
 
1.39 /εksit/, or /εzit/?
 
 British people seem to be equally divided, but note the <x> can represent either 
pronunciation. Which pronunciation occurs in the word

 How would you transcribe it? Transcribe the following words, carefully noting 
how the <x> is pronounced.
 
1.41 excess, exempt, exhibit  _______________________
 
 Did you notice the diff erent rhythm in the two words exit and exist? In the 
fi rst, the fi rst syllable is stronger: EXit (however the <x> is pronounced). In the 
second the second syllable is stronger: exIST. In transcriptions, there is a mark 
 placed at the beginning of a syllable to indicate the stronger stress. Th us

 We have already used words with two syllables, disyllabic words, to illustrate 
the two short vowels /i/ and /ε/. We should now add the stress mark to each of 
them, e.g. biscuit =

 Before we turn to the third short vowel, we can add four more rules to good 
transcription practice.
 
 
 9  A letter may represent two (or more) quite distinct phonemes, each of 
which must be transcribed distinctively; e.g. <c> may represent /k/ as in 
crib (= /k r i b/) or /s/ as in cent (= /s e n t/); <x> may represent /ks/ as 
in except ( = /ε k s ε p t/) or /gz/ as in exempt (= /ε  z ε m p t/).
 
 
10  Two words spelt identically but pronounced diff erently – these are 
called homographs – need to be transcribed diff erently; Celtic, incense.
 
 
11  Degrees of syllable strength need to be marked, especially in words of 
more than one syllable, polysyllabic words; incense (an aromatic sub-
stance) = /i n s ε n s/ and incense (to enrage) = /i ns ε n s/.
 
 
12  Alternative pronunciations in a single accent must be respected and cor-
responding alternative transcriptions acknowledged: exit may be either 
/ε k s i t/ or /ε  z i t/; exist may be either /i z i s t/ or /ε z i s t/.
 
 
Th ese 12 rules need to be remembered and applied in the rest of this course, 
but having established them, we can now move more quickly through the 
remaining list of short vowels.

 Th e third short vowel listed was in the word
 
1.48 lack
 
 It is traditionally represented by an IPA symbol that looks like the Old English 
‘ash’ letter // as if a letter <e> was joined to <a>. You draw it by starting 
with a reverse <c>; then loop back through the middle of it, and fi nish with 
an <e>.
Alternatively, you can use the printed form of the letter <a>, but be careful 
to distinguish it from the handwritten shape that looks like this: ɑ. Th is is 

13
CHAPTER 1
Vowels
important, because we are going to need the handwritten shape for the symbol 
of a diff erent vowel. To draw the ‘printed <a>’, you start with the top and front 
of the letter, drawing a curved top and a straight line down; then from the 
bottom point you draw a circle in front.
Lack is transcribed either as
l æ k  or  l a k
 
 You choose! Th e fi rst one is traditional and is also handy to represent American 
accents; the second one represents most modern British accents, especially of 
the younger generation. By having both symbols available, you can begin to see 
how we can exploit them for transcribing diff erent accents. Get used to using

CHAPTER 1
Vowels
 
The long vowels
 
 Th e long vowels are – literally – longer than the short vowels. You might be 
able to hear the diff erence in the length of the vowels in the two words grin and 
green. If I am asked to say the vowel that occurs in grin, I am likely to say it as 
/i/; and if asked to say the vowel in green, I am likely to say it as ‘ee’. Now, if you 
can, compare the two together:
 
1.86 /i/ ∼ ‘ee’
 
 If you consult phoneticians’ books on the description of English pronuncia-
tion, you will fi nd details of this diff erence in length (see for instance Gimson 
2008, Roach 2009, etc.). Th e long vowels are roughly twice the length of the short 
vowels; this is such a signifi cant phonetic diff erence that it is the basis of one 
important grouping of vowels in English: long vowels distinct from short vowels.
Th ere is also a phonological diff erence between the two: whereas short 
vowels have to be followed by a consonant in English, this is not the case for 
the long vowels – they can occur at the end of a word ‘unchecked’, as it were. 
Th e vowel in green appears at the end of the word agree, without the necessity 
of a consonant following. (A consonant may follow, of course, as in agreed, but 
it is not required as in the case of short vowels.)
Long vowels are themselves divided into two groups according to how 
steady the tongue is while they are being pronounced. If the tongue is relatively 
steady, they are called monophthongs (or ‘pure’ vowels); if there is a degree of 
movement by the tongue, they are called diphthongs. In my pronunciation of 
the ‘ee’ vowel, the tongue remains relatively stable, but when I pronounce the 
vowel I (or eye, or aye), the tongue rises to a higher position in the mouth and 
thus it qualifi es as a diphthong. Said slowly, the movement of the tongue can 
be heard more easily:
 
1.87 “aayyee”
 
 Th e length of the monophthongal long vowels is symbolised in the IPA by 
two points rather like a colon aft er the vowel symbol; for instance, the vowel 
in green is /i/. Th e length of the diphthongal long vowels is symbolized by a 
double vowel symbol in which the starting and ending points of the tongue’s 
movement are represented; for instance, the vowel in I (eye, aye) is transcribed 
as /ai/, where the /a/ represents the position of the tongue before it begins to 
move, and the /i/ its position when it fi nishes.
It is important to think of the diphthongs as an essential part of a single 
vowel system in English, and not as a separate system. When languages and 
accents are compared, it may be tempting to treat the monophthongs and 
diphthongs separately, for convenience; but to do so would be highly mislead-
ing, as the short vowels and the long vowels – both monophthongs and diph-
thongs – form a single system. In fact, what is a diphthong in one accent may 
correspond to a monophthong in another, and vice versa, as we shall see in 
Chapter 5. And what is a monophthong in one language may have a diphthong 
as its nearest equivalent in another – and vice versa.

18
PART ONE
Words
We will present the fi ve monophthongal long vowels fi rst because they can 
each be compared with a short vowel.
Monophthongs (‘pure’ vowels)
 
 Th e vowel in
 
1.88 green
 
 is a monophthongal long vowel. In most educated, standard, accents of English 
– not only in UK, but also around the world – this vowel requires a relatively 
steady tongue position. Th at position is close to the position the tongue has 
for the /i/ vowel; hence, the sense of comparison between the two vowels. 
However, you can feel that the tongue position is slightly diff erent; in the green 
vowel, the tongue is slightly higher, closer to the roof of the mouth, and slightly 
further forward, than it is for the grin vowel. (Th e grin vowel is then said to 
be lower, or opener, than the green vowel.) Because the tongue positions are 
diff erent for the two vowels, the sound quality of the two is diff erent; the dif-
ference in the sound quality is indicated in the IPA by a diff erent shape to the 
symbol: /i/ represents the higher, closer, quality, whereas the /i/ represents a 
slightly lower, opener, quality. Adding the length symbol gives us the symbol 
/i/ for the green vowel; the whole word is thus transcribed as
g r i: n

 Th e second monophthongal long vowel is found in the word
 
1.95 palm
 
 and is oft en compared to the short vowel of Pam. Th e palm vowel is not only 
longer but also – at least, in the case of most standard accents of UK and North 
America – it has a diff erent sound quality. Th e tongue positions of the Pam and 
palm vowels are diff erent; the tongue is positioned further back in the mouth 
for palm. Th is means that since the quality as well as the quantity is diff erent, a 
diff erent shape for the vowel symbol is required. Th e IPA uses the handwritten 
shape of <ɑ>, and, then, of course, the length symbol: /ɑ/. Palm is transcribed as
p Ā m
 
 Th e <l> in palm is, of course, not pronounced.

rhotic accents). Th e typical educated, standard, pronunciation in England for

 Finally, there is another issue with the pronunciation of this vowel. How do 
you pronounce the word class? You will know of the rough division between 
SESP and others in this respect; Northerners use the // (/a/) vowel, whereas 
Southerners use the /ɑ/:
 
1.104 /kls ~ klɑs/
 
 Th is choice of vowel is typically found before /-s, st, sp, f, ft , nt, ns/. Transcribe 
the following words in both types of pronunciation:

Diphthongs
 
 Th e diphthongs are long vowels – as has already been explained – in which 
there is a noticeable movement of the tongue. In English the movement of 
the tongue has three possible directions: either higher towards the front of the 
roof of the mouth, that is, in the general direction towards the /i/ or /i/ vowel; 
or higher towards the back, that is, in the general direction towards the /υ/ or 
/u/ vowel; or towards a central area, that is, in the general direction of the /
/ 
or // vowel. Th ese three directions are called front closing, back closing and 
centring, respectively.
Th ere are three ‘front closing’ diphthongs in Southern English Standard 
Pronunciation; they occur in the following words and name:
 
1.167 lake, like, Lloyd
 
 In the fi rst one, lake, the tongue does not move a great deal, but you can never-
theless feel the movement as you imitate the vowel sound by itself ‘a. . . .e’. Its 
symbol is a double one, indicating the positions of the tongue at the beginning 
and at the end of the movement: /ei/. Th e [e] indicates a tongue position a little 
closer than the English /ε/ and more like the vowel in the German word Tee 
(French thé, etc.). And the second part [i] indicates the position of the tongue 
at the end of the diphthongal movement.
Say the vowel slowly, to give yourself time to feel the movement of the 
tongue:

 In the North of England, Scotland and Wales, an alternative standard pronun-
ciation is heard, in which there is no diphthongal movement at all, but a long 
monophthong – just like the vowel in the German word Tee, French thé, etc. 
(Look back at pp. 9–10.) Th is vowel would be transcribed as /e/. Listen to it in

 Th e fi rst one, as in
 
1.193 load
 
 has a number of variations, but the main one in Southern English Standard 
Pronunciation has the tongue beginning in a central position and fi nishing 
like /υ/ or /u/. Th e IPA symbol for the initial position of the tongue is like an 
upturned, inverted <e>: [ə]; this symbol is called schwa. To draw it, you start from

 North American accents generally render this diphthong as /oυ/ since the 
tongue moves from a back position. But there is also an important variation to 
the /əυ/ vowel in Southern English Standard Pronunciation, before the conso-
nant /l/. In this case, the tongue begins in the position for the /ɒ/ vowel, and 
moves to /υ/. Listen to the two pronunciations of the word old: the  standard
 
1.198 /əυld/ and the alternative /ɒυld/.
 
 Th is variation in the pronunciation of the vowel occurs only before the con-
sonant /l/ in the same syllable. Transcribe the two versions of the following

 In addition to this variation in SESP, a quite diff erent sound to this vowel is 
heard in Northern English, Scottish and Welsh standard pronunciations and 
sounds like the long monophthong in the French word chaud (‘hot’), German 
so, Welsh lôn. It is transcribed in IPA as the letter <o> with length marks: /o/. 
Listen to the following few examples
 
1.201 load go

 You can now transcribe
 
1.227 poor, tour, boor, dour  _____________________
 
 However, here too there is a very strong tendency among the younger gen-
eration of SESP speakers to replace this diphthong entirely – mainly by 
 substituting it with the long monophthong
 
1.228 /ɔ/
 
 Th us moor becomes homophonous with more, poor with paw/pour/pore, 
tour with tore, and boor with bore. Similarly the word sure is now much more

 commonly pronounced as homophonous with shore, rather than with the 
diphthong /υə/.
 
1.229 /mυə, mɔ/ /pυə, pɔ/ /tυə, tɔ/ /bυə, bɔ/ /ʃυə, ʃɔ/
 
 However, the alternative pronunciation of dour does not follow this pattern; it 
is not /dɔ/ (‘door’), but /daυə/ and produces a homophone with dower.
 
1.230 /dυə, daυə/
 
 In rhotic accents, the centring diphthongs do not exist as such, since the fi nal 
letter <r> is pronounced. In these accents the words leer, lair and moor are

The weak vowels
 
 And, fi nally, the weak vowels. Th e weak vowels are confi ned to weak, unstressed, 
syllables. All the short and long vowels introduced already are all strong vowels 
and all occur in strong, stressed, syllables. Th e short vowels /i/ and /υ/ can also 
occur in weak syllables, but there are three weak vowels in SESP which can 
occur in weak syllables only.
Th ese three weak vowels resemble the three fi nishing points of the three 
kinds of English diphthongs; they are pronounced with the tongue in either a 
‘front close’ position, a ‘back close’ position, or a ‘central’ position.
 
 Th e fi rst one occurs at the end of a word like
 
1.238 coff ee
 
 Th e fi nal vowel is in an unstressed syllable, it does not usually have the length 
of the /i/ vowel as in the word fee, and the tongue can vary between a position 
for the /i/ vowel and the /i/ vowel without any consequences for the meaning 
of the word. Th ere is a certain variability about the actual pronunciation of 
these weak vowels, and this is refl ected in a kind of compromise symbol – the 
letter <i>, but without the length marks: /i/. Th us coff ee is transcribed as

1.242 video /vidiəυ/
 
1.243 mediate /midieit/
 
 Th irdly, it occurs in the weak forms of words like he, we, me, be, that is, when 
these words are unstressed, e.g. he likes me; we live in Wales; be quick
 
1.244 /hi laiks mi/
 
1.245 /wi liv in weilz/
 
1.246 /bi kwik/

 Th e second weak vowel occurs likewise in the middle of words before a vowel, 
as in
 
1.247 (to) graduate /rdjueit/, Louise /luiz/
 
 It also occurs in the weak form of a word like to before a vowel, and at the end 
of a clause; the vowel is not usually as long as the vowel /u/ and the tongue 
position varies between the /u/ and /υ/ vowels; hence, its symbol is also a kind 
of compromise: the letter <u>, but without the length marks: /u/. Examples 
with unstressed to are to act; to own; to everyone.
 
1.248 /tu kt/
 
1.249 /tu əυn/

 Last, but not least, the third weak vowel, which is in fact the commonest vowel 
in English pronunciation. It is produced with the tongue in a central position 
and sounds rather like a hesitation:
 
1.254 uh
 
 It is oft en called the ‘neutral vowel’ because the tongue requires no muscular 
eff ort as it does to produce front and back vowels and close and open vowels; it 
is like ‘neutral gear’. Its symbol is the schwa: /ə/, which was fi rst introduced as 
the beginning of the back closing diphthong /əυ/ and then as the end of all the 
centring diphthongs. Like the other weak vowels, it is confi ned (in Southern 
English Standard Pronunciation) to unstressed syllables, as in the fi nal sylla-
bles of
 
1.255 farmer, drama
 
 It is important to notice that in non-rhotic accents, the <r> at the end of farmer 
is not pronounced, and the two words farmer and drama rhyme. Th ey are tran-

2 Consonants
 
 In most standard accents of English, there are twenty-four consonants, and 
they are grouped into fi ve types: plosives, nasals, fricatives, aff ricates and 
approximants.
 
Plosives
 
 Plosives are usually introduced fi rst because the kind of constriction in the 
mouth by which they are produced is total. Th ere are six of them: /p, b, t, d, k, 
/
 
 /p/ and /b/ are produced with the constriction at the lips (bilabial). In the case 
of /p/, the vocal folds (cords) produce no voicing, and so /p/ is consequently 
known as a voiceless plosive.
 
 /t/ and /d/ are produced with the constriction of the blade of the tongue against 
the ridge behind the upper teeth (alveolar); /t/ is voiceless.
 
 /k/ and // are produced with the constriction of the back of the tongue against 
the back of the roof of the mouth, the soft  palate (velar); /k/ is voiceless.

2.2 croquet, league, grotesque, chemist, school, stomach, ache
 _______________________________________________
 
 Note that <p> is silent in receipt and many words like psychology, pneumatic.
 
 <b> is silent in debt, doubt, subtle and in lamb, tomb, climb, plumb.
 
 <t> is silent in listen, whistle, soft en, Christmas and at the end of many words of 
French origin like ballet.
 
 <d> is silent in handsome, handkerchief, sandwich and for most people also in 
Wednesday.
 
 <k> is silent at the beginning of words before <n>: knee, knife, knock.
 
 <g> is silent likewise: gnat, gnome; and at the end of words also: sign,
foreign.

CHAPTER 2
Consonants
 
Nasals
 
 Nasals have the same constriction as plosives except that air is allowed to pass 
through the nose, but not through the mouth. Th ere are three nasals in English: 
/m/ (bilabial), /n/ (alveolar) and /ŋ/ (velar); none of them are voiceless. Th e 
IPA symbol for the velar nasal is the letter <n> supplemented with the tail of 
<> as in the words
 
2.3 bank /bŋk/, anger /ŋə/
 
 and is also found as the <ng> spelling at the end of a word like bang /bŋ/. Th e 
letter <g> is not pronounced separately in such words in SESP.

2.8 inkling, weakling, fatling  _____________________
 
 
*
 
Fricatives
 
 Fricatives have a looser constriction in the mouth, which allows friction to be 
produced at the point of contact. Th ere are nine fricatives: four pairs and /h/. 
/f/ and /v/ are produced with the constriction between the lower lip and the 
upper teeth (labiodental); /f/ is voiceless. Compare and transcribe
 
2.9 grief, grieve

Th e ninth fricative is /h/, which is voiceless at the beginning of a word, but 
is usually voiced in the middle of a word; because the two voicing possibilities 
never contrast meanings of words in English, /h/ constitutes a single phoneme 
and so a single symbol is suffi  cient.

Affricates
 
 An aff ricate consonant is a close knit sequence of plosive and fricative pro-
duced by a single organ of speech (articulator). In English, there are just two. 
One is commonly spelt <ch> and occurs, for instance, at the beginning of the 
word chip;
 
2.67 chip
 
 Its IPA symbol is a combination of /t/ and /ʃ/ representing the sequence of 
plosive and fricative made by the body of the tongue in the post-alveolar area: 
/tʃ/. Th e symbol also indicates its voicelessness. Th e other aff ricate occurs at 
the beginning of the word gem and is commonly spelt with <g> (before <i> 
and <e>), <j>, and <dge>.
 
2.68 gem
 
 Its IPA symbol is a ‘voiced’ equivalent of /tʃ/: a combination of /d/ for the 
plosive element and // for the fricative element: /d/.

CHAPTER 2
Consonants
 
Approximants
 
 Th ere now remain just four approximants. An approximant is a consonant in 
which the constriction made by an organ of speech (articulator) is not great 
enough to produce any friction at all. Th e four approximants occur at the 
beginning of the words
 
2.107 lot, rot, yacht and what
 
 Th e fi rst is known as a lateral approximant, since the sides of the tongue are 
lowered while the blade presses against the upper teeth ridge (alveolar); this 
allows air to fl ow either side of the constriction without friction. It is typically 
spelt <l> or <ll> in English; its IPA symbol is /l/. Lot is transcribed as
l Ġ t
 
 Linguists usually distinguish between two main varieties of /l/ in English: the 
clear /l/ that occurs before vowels and /j/ and the dark /l/, with the back of the 
tongue raised, that occurs before consonants (except /j/) or at the end of words. 
Since the two varieties never contrast meanings in English, together they con-
stitute a single phoneme, and so only a single symbol is required. Transcribe
 
2.108 well, full, fulfi l/fulfi ll, dollar  ___________________
 
 and the names:
 
2.109 Gill/Jill, Leo, Lionel, Billy, Sally  ________________
 
 Th e dark /l/ seems to lead to an additional syllable when it occurs aft er the 
long monophthongs /i/ and /u/ and the diphthongs /ei, ai, ɔi, əυ, aυ/, that is 
when the tongue concludes the vowel articulation in a close, or high, position. 
Th e tongue needs time to adjust to the raising of the back of the tongue for the 
dark /l/, and this adjustment sounds like /ə/ and is known as breaking. As this 
adjustment is normal, and because no contrast in meaning is possible, there is 
no need to transcribe this breaking:
 
2.110 feel fool 
fail 
fi le/phial foil 
foal 
foul/fowl
 
 /fil/ /ful/ /feil/ /fail/ 
/fɔil/ /fəυl/ /faυl/
 
 We take up the issue of breaking again in Chapter 4.
 
 
*
Th e second approximant is found at the beginning of rot.
 
2.111 rot
 
 Th e blade (or, for some people, the front) of the tongue approaches (the back 
of) the teeth ridge (alveolar); its IPA symbol is an upturned <r>: [ɹ]; but for 
convenience, the ordinary letter <r> is used, except when English is being 
compared to another language. An <r> before a consonant or at the end of 
a word has been lost in pronunciation in the standard accents of England 
since the eighteenth century; these non-rhotic accents are now found also 

48
PART ONE

in Wales, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Th e rhotic accents of 
the West Country of England, Scotland, Ireland and North America retain a 
fi nal /r/ in pronunciation, as we have already noted from time to time. Rot is

 and these names in both a rhotic and a non-rhotic accent
 
2.115 Charles, George, Marjorie, Bart, Richard
 _______________________________________________
 _______________________________________________
 
 
*
Th e remaining two approximants are traditionally called semi-vowels 
because they are formed like close vowels, but they do not function as vowels. 
Th e approximant at the beginning of yacht is formed in a similar way to the 
/i/ vowel; the body of the tongue is raised towards the roof of the mouth, the 
hard palate (palatal).
 
2.116 yacht
 
 Th e IPA symbol is the letter <j>. Th us yacht is transcribed as
j Ġ t
 
 Now you can transcribe
 
2.117 you, youth, young, yet, yeast, yellow, yearn

 Th e /j/ consonant also occurs in the spelling <ew, eu>. Notice that you, ewe and 
yew are homophones

 Note that in American accents no /j/ appears in such words aft er /t, d, n/; 
e.g. dew, deuce, Tewkesbury, Tuesday, new, neuter, whereas it does in British 
accents. And notice too that the following words with <ew> are no longer com-
monly pronounced with /j/
 
2.121 lewd /lud/
 
2.122 chew /tʃu/
 
2.123 Jew /du/
 
 Th e /j/ consonant is not spelt directly in a word like cute.
 
2.124 cute
 
 However, the /j/ consonant between the consonant /k/ and the vowel /u/ must 
be transcribed, for the transcription /kut/ represents the word coot.
 
2.125 coot
 
 Th e transcription of cute must include the /j/ symbol: /kjut/. Now transcribe
 
2.126 mute, music, unit, unite, union, consume, presume, beauty, futile
 _______________________________________________
 
 and notice the two pronunciations of the homograph: use, and its derivatives 
abuse, misuse. In each case, the verb takes /-z/.
 
2.127 use, abuse, misuse
 
 Th e diff erence between British and American accents with /d, t, n/ appears in 
these cases too: due, tutor, nucleus. Notice also that words with other alveolar 
consonants are no longer commonly pronounced with /j/, even in Britain:
 
2.128 rue, lute, fl ute, sue/Sue, suit
 
 
*
And fi nally, the approximant in the word what.
 
2.129 what
 
 It is formed in a way similar to the vowel /u/; the back of the tongue is raised 
towards the back of the roof of the mouth, the soft  palate, while at the same 
time the lips are rounded and narrowed (labial-velar). Th e IPA symbol is the 
letter <w>; what, as you know already, is transcribed as

them without the /w/ symbol

 However, there are still two features of English pronunciation involving 
 consonants that need explanation and practice: the occurrence of syllabic 
 consonants and the form of consonants in infl ections.
 
 
*
 
Syllabic Consonants
 
 In certain circumstances in English, a consonant can constitute the centre (or 
peak) of a syllable instead of a vowel. It is clear that whereas a word like sad 
/sd/ has one syllable, a word like sadder /sdə/ has two. Th ere is clearly a 
vowel articulated in the second, albeit unstressed, syllable aft er the consonant 
/d/. However, in words like
 
2.131 sadden, saddle
 
 the matter is not so clear, because the consonant /d/ can be followed by either 
the consonants /n/ and /l/ without a vowel intervening. Listen to the two words 
in slow motion:

51
CHAPTER 2
Consonants
 
2.132 sadden, saddle
 
 If you imitate these pronunciations, you should notice that the blade 
of the tongue maintains some kind of constriction as you proceed from the 
/d/ to the /n/ or /l/; there cannot possibly, therefore, have been a vowel in 
between!
In cases like these, the /n/ of sadden and the /l/ of saddle constitute the centre 
of the second, unstressed, syllable; this syllabic function of theirs is marked by a 
small mark [] below the consonant symbol. Sadden and saddle are transcribed 
thus:
s æ d n   ٥
s æ d l٥
 
 Syllabic /n/ and /l/ typically occur in unstressed syllables immediately follow-
ing the alveolar consonants, /t, s, z/ as well as /d/. Listen to, and transcribe, the 
following words
 
2.133 cotton ____ 
2.134 cattle 
____
 
 listen 
____ 
 
whistle ____
 
 risen 
____ 
 
drizzle ____
 
 Syllabic /l/ can also follow /st/ or plain /n/ or /nt/
 
2.135 pistol, tunnel, mantle
 _______________________________________________
 
 Transcribe these words
 
2.136 muddle, widen, smitten, hospital, loosen, hassle, cousin, weasel, gentle
 _______________________________________________
 
2.137 Bristol Channel
 _______________________________________________
 
 and the names
 
2.138 Gordon, Jordan, Tarzan, Norton
 _______________________________________________
 
 When the -ing suffi  x is added to a verb with a syllabic consonant, the syllabic 
consonant may either be retained as such or it simply becomes the initial con-
sonant of the extra syllable. So, for instance, if -ing is added to the verb listen, 
the word becomes either a trisyllabic word with a syllabic consonant in the 
middle: listening /lisniŋ/, or a disyllabic word: /lisniŋ/. Listen to them again 
and compare them
 
2.139 /lisniŋ/; /lisniŋ/
 
 Transcribe these words in the same two ways

52
PART ONE
Words
 
2.140 whistling, drizzling, muddling, widening, loosening
 _______________________________________________
 _______________________________________________
 
 But note that an intervening /ə/ occurs in
 
2.141 wanton, London, Hampton
 _______________________________________________
 
 Notice that a syllabic /m/ oft en occurs in the word happen in colloquial speech 
as in
 
2.142 If you want to make things happen /hpm /.
 
 And occasionally in the word open, as in
 
2.143 None of them are open /əυpm /.
 
 With -ing added to these verbs, the /n/ is retained:
 
2.144 happening /hpniŋ/
 
2.145 opening /əυpniŋ/
 
 In all these cases, the syllabic consonant follows immediately on a consonant 
made at the same point of articulation (homorganic articulation). Otherwise, 
the neutral vowel /ə/ intervenes as in, for example
 
2.146 autumn /ɔtəm/
 
2.147 bacon /beikən/
 
2.148 apple /pəl/
 
 Listen to, and transcribe, the following words with an intervening neutral 
vowel /ə/
 
2.149 table, soft en, seven, southern, struggle, camel, cannon/canon, million, fashion, 
dungeon
 _______________________________________________
 
 When the -ing suffi  x is added to a verb with the neutral vowel preceding the 
fi nal consonant, the neutral vowel will oft en disappear. So, for instance, if -ing 
is added to the verb soft en, the word becomes either /sɒfəniŋ/ with three 
 syllables, or /sɒfniŋ/ with two.
 
2.150 soft ening
 
 Transcribe these words in these two ways
 
2.151 struggling, tackling, fashioning, beckoning, strengthening
 _______________________________________________
 _______________________________________________

53
CHAPTER 2
Consonants
 
 Th e ending -ism is also pronounced with a neutral vowel between the /z/ and 
/m/; for instance
 
2.152 prism /prizəm/
 
2.153 racism /reisizəm/
 
2.154 feminism /fεminizəm/
 
 Also the word
 
2.155 chasm /kzəm/
 
 
*
 
Inﬂ ections
 
 Infl ections are endings that change the form of a word for a grammatical cat-
egory without changing its grammatical class. Th us sadder and saddest contain 
infl ections for the grammatical categories of comparative and superlative but 
the words remain adjectives, whereas the word sadness contains a derivational 
form that changes the word to the class noun.
Th e regular comparative infl ection <-er> is pronounced /-ə/, or /-ər/ in 
rhotic accents; transcribe
 
2.156 deeper, fatter, higher, lower, quieter
 _______________________________________________
 
 Th e regular superlative infl ection <-est> is pronounced with either /-əst/ or 
/-ist/. Transcribe these words in both ways
 
2.157 deepest, fattest, highest, lowest, quietest
 _______________________________________________
 _______________________________________________
 
 Th e regular past tense or past participle infl ection <-ed> is pronounced in 
three diff erent ways according to the fi nal sound of the stem.

 infl ection is pronounced in a reduced form /-d /, e.g.
 
2.159 freed /frid/, cried /kraid/, warned /wɔnd/, raised /reizd/

 Th e regular present tense third person infl ection <-es> also has three possible 
pronunciations, again depending on the fi nal sound of the stem. Th e regular 
plural infl ection and the genitive possessive infl ection of nouns follow exactly 
the same pattern.
 
 (1) If the stem ends in /s, z, ʃ, , tʃ, d/ (the so-called sibilant consonants) the 
infl ection is pronounced ‘in full’, either as /-əz/ or /-iz/, e.g.
 
2.166 crosses /krɒsəz, krɒsiz/
 
2.167 watches /wɒtʃəz, wɒtʃiz/

 (Can you detect which one you use? It will probably match your choice with 
<-ed>. Are taxes and taxis the same for you; or possibly offi  ces and offi  cers?)
 
 (2) If the stem ends in a vowel or a voiced consonant (other than the sibilants), 
the infl ection is pronounced in a reduced form /-z/, e.g.
 
2.169 frees /friz/, cries /kraiz/, warns /wɔnz/, John’s /dɒnz/
 
 (3) If the stem ends in a voiceless consonant (other than the sibilants), the 
reduced form is changed to /-s/, e.g.
 
2.170 stops /stɒps/, coughs /kɒfs/, waits/weights /weits/, Mike’s /maiks/
 
 Th ere are two cases where an irregular infl ection is not refl ected in the spelling. 
Note that the fi nal /s/ of house changes to /z/ when the plural suffi  x is added.

 Well done! You have now covered all the vowels and consonants of English!

3 Word Stress
 
 Th e pronunciation of a word consists of at least one syllable; if a word in 
English consists of more than one syllable, one syllable will sound more promi-
nent than any other. Th at greater prominence is what is called stress, and we 
have already introduced the IPA symbol for it [  ]. Th e earliest examples we 
introduced included snippet
 
3.1 /snipit/
 
 with the stress on the fi rst syllable, and exist
 
3.2 /εzist, izist/
 
 with the stress on the second syllable.
 
 Stressed syllables contain any of the strong vowels; unstressed syllables contain 
a weak vowel, and also /i/ or /υ/ if at most one consonant follows as in deceive 
and educate
 
3.3 /disiv/, /εdjυkeit/
 
 However, there is an intermediate degree of stress that occurs in many English 
words. Take the word pronunciation itself; it has fi ve syllables:
 
3.4 /prə.n
n.si.ei.ʃən/
 
 Th e fourth syllable /.ei./ has the greatest degree of prominence and so will be 
marked as stressed: /prən
nsieiʃən/. Th e fi rst, third and fi ft h syllables all 
contain weak vowels, but the remaining one, the second, has the strong vowel 
/
/, and sounds too strong to be unstressed, but not strong enough to be the 
stressed syllable. Hence we make a distinction between the primary stress /.ei./ 
and a secondary stress /.n
n./, which is nevertheless heard to be more promi-
nent than non-stress, i.e. unstressed syllables. Th e IPA symbol for secondary 
stress is a stress mark at the foot of the following syllable: /prən
nsieiʃən/.
 
 Th e identifi cation of secondary stress is important in three types of word: long 
words which have any number of syllables before the primary stress, a number 
of homographs, and compound words.
First of all, listen to the four syllables of the word economic:
 
3.5 /i.kə.nɒm.ik/, /ε.kə.nɒm.ik/
 
 In either pronunciation, which is the syllable with the primary stress? Th e third 
one /.nɒm./. Th e second and fourth syllables both contain weak vowels, but 

57
CHAPTER 3
Word Stress
the fi rst contains either the long vowel /i/ or the short vowel /ε/. Both are 
strong vowels; that fi rst syllable is more prominent than the weak syllables, 
but not as prominent as the primary stress. Th erefore, it has secondary stress: 
/ikənɒmik/ or /εkənɒmik/.
Now identify the secondary stress in the following words and try to tran-
scribe the whole word
 
3.6 fundamental, educational, university, scientifi c, communication
  ___________________________________________________
 
 Th ese cases of secondary stress are subject to change in phrases like
 
3.7 pronunciation principles, fundamental ideas
 
 Th at is one reason why it is important to fi rst identify their secondary stresses 
as single words. (Briefl y, what happens is that the sequence of secondary then 
primary stress in a word like pronunciation /prən
nsieiʃən/ is reversed in 
a phrase like pronunciation principles: /prən
nsieiʃən prinsipəlz/; simi-
larly fundamental ideas: /f
ndəmεntl aidiəz/; but all this will be clarifi ed 
in Chapter 7.)
Secondly, there are a number of homographs in which the ending -ate 
changes pronunciation according to whether they are verbs or not. Take, for 
instance:
 
3.8 separate
 
 as an adjective, the -ate is pronounced with a neutral vowel: /sεprət/, but as a 
verb, the -ate is pronounced with a strong vowel: /sεpəreit/. Th at long vowel 
is, in fact, another case of secondary stress: /sεpəreit/. Now transcribe these 
homographs in the same two ways
 
3.9 moderate, advocate, associate, delegate, duplicate, graduate
 _______________________________________________
 _______________________________________________
 
Compound words
 
 Finally, compounds are single words that consist, usually, of two otherwise 
independent words. To take a simple example, compare the phrase black bird 
with the compound blackbird in a statement like:
 
3.10 A crow is a black bird, but is bigger than a blackbird.
 
 Th e phrase black bird has a primary stress on each word: /blk bd/; but 
the compound blackbird has only one primary stress, on the fi rst part. Th e 
second part contains a strong vowel and is treated as a secondary stress: 
/blkbd/.
It is important to note that compounds are sometimes spelt as a single 

58
PART ONE
Words
word, or as hyphenated, or with a word space; you could think of three ways of 
writing this compound
 
3.11 teatime, tea-time, tea time
 
 However it is spelt, there is only one primary stress. Identify the primary 
and secondary stresses in the following compounds and transcribe the whole 
 compound word.
 
 Compound check (1)
 
3.12 teaspoon, coff ee cup, dinner plates, lunch box, supper time,
 _______________________________________________
 
 overdone, underneath, hard boiled, half-baked, short-changed
 _________________________________________________ 
     (See Key)
 
 Notice too that a compound itself can become one part of another compound: 
thus, two secondary stresses are required
 
3.13 railway, railway lines, railway station _______________________________
 
 It is oft en the case that the second part of a compound will be reduced to an 
unstressed syllable with a weak vowel
 
3.14 Englishman, Scotland, Portsmouth, strawberry, boatswain
 _______________________________________________
 
 Finally, a compound may contain one, or two, bound stems of Greek or Latin 
origin. Th e stress pattern depends on the form of the second part; compare 
homophone and homograph with primary stress on the fi rst part, and homor-
ganic with secondary stress on the fi rst part: /hɒməfəυn/, /hɒmərɑf/ and 
/hɒmɔnik/.

Chapter 7.
You have now completed a pretty comprehensive introduction to the tran-
scription of all the words in English not only in the Southern England Standard 
Pronunciation but also, in a number of cases, in other standards too.
But we haven’t fi nished yet!

59
CHAPTER 3
Word Stress
We can be a bit more systematic about the diff erences in accents; we can 
also be a bit more detailed in variations in individual sounds; we can also take 
note of what happens when words come together – for instance, the <n>s in 
ten green bottles usually change, in the fi rst case, to /ŋ/, and in the second, to 
/m/; then we can also take note of the eff ect of the rhythm of English speech 
in messages; and fi nally, we can include intonation which powerfully aff ects 
messages.
First of all, we will look at some of the important details of individual sounds 
– in the way they are made.

60
 
4 Allophones
 
 When we introduced the symbol /l/, we noted that linguists usually distinguish 
between two varieties, known as clear and dark (p. 47). Th e two varieties never 
contrast with each other in English and so are never responsible for creating 
diff erences in meaning. Th is is because the two varieties are distributed diff er-
ently in English words; the distribution of the clear /l/ is confi ned to a position 
before vowels (and before /j/), and the distribution of the dark /l/ to a position 
before consonants (except /j/) and at the end of words. Th e distribution of the 
one variety complements the distribution of the other – they can never occur 
in exactly the same position as the other. Th at is why they cannot clash, and 
that is why they are considered as varieties of one phoneme (in English). A 
phoneme is the basic unit in the phonological system of a language.
Phoneme is a technical word in linguistics and is preferred to the general 
word sound. You might now begin to see why this technical term is necessary. 
If someone should ask ‘How many l sounds are there in English?’, the answer 
most (non-linguistics) people would give is “One”; but now you know that 
there are at least these two varieties. Th e answer thus depends on what per-
spective a person takes. Th ere is only one l sound in the pronunciation (pho-
nological) system, i.e. only one /l/ phoneme; but there are two diff erent sounds 
from the point of view of actual articulation, i.e. from a purely phonetic per-
spective. Th e technical term for varieties of a single phoneme, that show such 
 complementary distribution, is allophone. Th is kind of variation is thus known 
as allophonic variation.
Th e form of transcription that we have established so far has focused on 
phonemes; it has oft en been referred to as ‘broad transcription’. If we wanted 
to include the details of allophonic variations, we would be turning to ‘narrow 
transcription’. But why would anyone want to do that?
First of all, simply because these variations exist! Because they are there 
and we can talk about them, we need also a method of referring to them in 
print. Secondly, if people want to write about phonetic diff erences in a range 
of accents of a language, then some kind of ‘narrow’ transcription is useful. 
Th irdly, if people want to write about phonetic diff erences in the pronuncia-
tion (phonological systems) of languages, we need a transcription system that 
captures such details; for example, although both English and French have a 
phoneme /p/, they are articulated diff erently, and that phonetic diff erence can 
be captured in a ‘narrow’ transcription. And fourthly, if it is necessary to record 
diff erences in individual people’s pronunciation, then a ‘narrow’  transcription 

61
CHAPTER 4
Allophones
is best – for example, for clinical purposes, or for identifying people in a foren-
sic context, or comparing children in acquisition studies, or recording students 
learning a foreign language, etc.
To indicate a ‘broad’ (phonemic) transcription, the convention is to use 
slant brackets, / /, as we have done so far. To indicate a ‘narrow’ (allophonic) 
transcription, the convention is to use square brackets, [ ]. (In fact, you saw 
square brackets on page 25 when told how to try and feel the tongue movement 
in diphthongs; the use of the square brackets was to indicate that the symbols 
were not to be taken as phonemes.) To illustrate the use of the square brackets, 
we shall return to the case of the two allophones of the English phoneme /l/. 
Th e clear allophone is transcribed as [l], but the dark variety traditionally as 
[], or nowadays as [lγ]. Th e principle is the same as for phonemes: just as each 
diff erent phoneme has to be represented by a distinctly diff erent symbol, so 
each allophone has also to be represented by a distinctly diff erent symbol. Th e 
addition of ‘~’/‘γ’ to the [l] marks the diff erence between the two forms. Now, 
you will notice that the same symbol (letter) is used for the phoneme /l/ and 
the clear allophone [l]; that is precisely why you need to keep the use of the 
diff erent brackets clear in your mind. Angle brackets, < >, are used to refer to 
ordinary orthography. Read this sentence as an illustration:
 
 In most English accents, the phoneme /l/, which is usually spelled as <l> or 
<ll>, is articulated as two distinct allophones: the clear [l] occurs before vowels 
and the consonant /j/, whereas the dark []/[lγ] occurs before consonants, 
except /j/, and at the end of words.
 
Consonants
 
 Th ere are some other important cases of allophonic variation among the con-
sonants of English. We will take them in roughly the order in which you learnt 
to transcribe the consonants.
Aspiration
 
 First of all, the plosives. Th ree plosives were described (p. 38) as voiceless, /p, 
t, k/. On most occasions there is a brief delay in the onset of voicing when 
a vowel or a voiced consonant follows; this brief delay is known as aspira-
tion. However, if they are preceded immediately by /s/ at the beginning of a 
word, this aspiration does not occur. Th us there are two distinct allophones 
of English /p/: an aspirated variety and an unaspirated variety. (Incidentally, it 
is the presence of this aspiration that constitutes the main diff erence between 
English and French /p/, and /t, k/.) Th e aspiration is recorded in narrow tran-
scription as [h]. Th us aspirated /p/ is transcribed narrowly as [ph]; similarly [th] 
and [kh].
Now, the pronunciation of a word like pin can be transcribed broadly as 
/pin/, and narrowly as [phin]. It is exactly the same word, with exactly the 
same pronunciation, but transcribed in both broad and narrow transcriptions. 

62

4.1 tin 
/___ / and [ ____ ]
 
 kin 
/___ / and [ ____ ]
 
 What about the unaspirated allophone? Simply [ph] without the [h]: just [p]! 
Notice again the importance of the brackets: the same symbol (letter) is used 
for the phoneme /p/ and the unaspirated allophone [p] – it is the brackets that 
determines how the symbol is to be interpreted. It is the same with /t/ and [t], 
and /k/ and [k]. Th us the pronunciation of the word spin can be transcribed 
broadly as /spin/ and narrowly as [spin]; the latter case shows that the /p/ is 
the unaspirated allophone. Similarly
 
4.2 stint /____ / and [ _____ ]
 
 skin  /____ / and [ _____ ]
 
 Th is allophonic variation appears in other parts of words too. Take the word
 
4.3 appear
 
 you can transcribe it both broadly / _____ / and narrowly showing the 
 aspiration of the /p/ [_______]. Now
 
4.4 aspire
 
 broadly / _____ /, and narrowly, without the aspiration symbol [_____]. Try
 
4.5 return, disturb
 
 both broadly / ______ /, / ______ /, and narrowly [_____], [_____]. And
 
4.6 account, askance
 
 broadly / _____ /, /_____ /, and narrowly [_____], [_____]
 
 When /p, t, k/ are followed by silence at the end of an utterance, they are usually 
aspirated regardless of whether they are preceded by /s/:
 
4.7 ramp: [rmph]; grasp: [rsph, rɑsph]
 
 Transcribe the following narrowly
 
4.8 rent: [____]; rest: [____]
 
 rink: [____]; risk: [____]
 
 Alternatively, they may be simply ‘unreleased’, i.e. the closure is retained for 
longer, without the sound of aspiration; in that case the [h] would be inappro-
priate. If it became necessary to indicate non-release, the symbol [] is used. So 
help /hεlp/ might, in narrow transcription, be either [hεph] or [hεp].
 
 halt /hɒlt/ would either be [_____] or [_____].
 
 think /θiŋk/ would either be [_____] or [_____].
 
 (Th e degree of aspiration depends on whether /p, t, k/ occur at the beginning of 
a strong or a weak syllable; if it was ever necessary to distinguish between two 

63
CHAPTER 4
Allophones
degrees of aspiration, then [h] might be used to indicate the stronger form and 
[h] the weaker: depend: [diphεnd]; deepen: [diphən].)
 
 
*
Glottal reinforcement
 
 When /p, t, k/ occur at the end of a syllable before another consonant or before 
silence, they are typically ‘reinforced’ by closure at the glottis, as if a glottal stop 
preceded them. So map /mp/ is pronounced as [mʔph]; maps as [mʔps]; 
map shop as [mʔpʃɒʔph]. Listen:
 
4.9 map, maps, map shop
 
 Try
 
4.10 book /bυk/: [____]; book shelf: [___ ____]
 
4.11 foot /fυt/: [____]; footpath: [___ ___]
 
 You might notice that in the latter case, the [t] might seem to have disappeared 
completely, as [fυʔpɑθ]; the only trace of /t/ is the [ʔ]. Th is is now very 
common all over Britain, and helps to explain how in some accents the /t/ 
is regularly realized as [ʔ] not only in fi nal position but also in the middle of 
words, e.g. what as [wɒʔ], and water as [wɔʔə]. Listen
 
4.12 what, water
 
 
*
Voiced ﬂ apping
 
 Th e /t/ is subject to another kind of variation, where between voiced sounds, 
especially vowels, it acquires voicing and is articulated quickly with a quick 
‘fl ap’ of the blade of the tongue against the teeth ridge. Th is is the typical 
American pronunciation of /t/ in water; the symbol for this allophonic varia-
tion of /t/ is: [t], e.g. [wɔtə]. Th is ‘fl apped’ [t] is increasingly heard in SESP 
and many other accents. Th ink of the way many people say
 
4.13 you’d better, what’s the matter with you, but I . . .
 
 It is typically with [t]: [bεtə], [matə], [b
t ai].
Devoicing
 
 Th e voiced plosives /b, d, / lose their voicing ‘early’ when followed immedi-
ately by a voiceless consonant and before silence. A good example is the word 
absolutely; the voicing of /b/ fades in anticipation of the voicelessness of the 
following /s/; such fading is known as ‘devoicing’ and can be recorded in a 
narrow transcription as []: [bsəluʔli]. Nab in a narrow transcription is 
[nb]. (Th e subscript [] is replaced by a superscript [˚] where necessary, e.g. 
[˚].) Listen

 Devoicing also aff ects the voiced fricatives /

/d/. Love /l

4.21 [___]; hedge fund: [__ ___]
 
 Notice too how oft en such devoicing occurs in verb groups:
 
4.22 . . . is to . . . [iz tu]
 
 . . . has to . . . [___ __]
 
 . . . have to . . . [___ __]
 
 Another common environment for devoicing is when /l, r, j, w/ follow an 
aspirated plosive; the aspiration is conveyed by the delay on the onset of their 
voicing, as in
 
4.23 play /plei/ [plei]
 
 pray /prei/ [___] (but see below for more on /r/)
 
 pew /pju/ [___]
 
 queue /kju/ [___]
 
 quake /kweik/ [_____]
 
 A special case happens when /j/ follows /h/ as in hew/hue/Hugh; the /j/ typi-
cally takes on the voicelessness of the /h/ totally and becomes itself totally 
devoiced, with the two phonemes merging into one articulation. Th ere is a 
special phonetic symbol for the totally voiceless /j/: [ç]. Hew/hue/Hugh /hju/ 
is transcribed narrowly as [çu]. In narrow transcription huge is [çud˚].

 A similar case happens in some accents with many words beginning <wh-> with 
a pronunciation /hw/, e.g. whales, which /hweilz/, /hwitʃ/ (see pp. 43–44). 
Th e /w/ takes on the voicelessness of the /h/ totally, and the two phonemes 
merge in the same way. Th e special symbol for the totally voiceless /w/: []. So 
the narrow transcription of these two words is: [eilz], [itʃ]. Try
 
4.26 why /hwai/ [___]
 
 where /hwεə/ [___]
 
 whine /hwain/ [___]
 
 
*
/r/
 
 English /r/ is described as an approximant; the international symbol is actually 
[ɹ], as was mentioned on p. 47, and this is the symbol to be used in narrow 
transcription. So red /rεd/ is transcribed narrowly as [ɹεd]. However, there 
is allophonic variation in the phoneme /r/. Notice what typically happens to 
/r/ in the word thread /θrεd/; it might not be an approximant if there is a very 
brief contact between /θ/and /ε/, a sound that is known technically as a ‘tap’. 
Th e symbol for it is [ɾ]; so thread in narrow transcription is [θɾεd].
Furthermore, /r/ is fricative immediately aft er /t, d/; the IPA symbol for this 
[ɹ] – the diacritic [] indicates that the [ɹ] is raised (high enough for friction to be 
created). So dread /drεd/ is transcribed narrowly as [dɹεd]. Strictly speaking the 
‘devoiced’ /r/ following aspirated plosives is transcribed as [ɹ˚], because it is not 
only fricative but also devoiced; so tread /trεd/ in narrow transcription should 
be [tɹ˚εd]. However, [ɹ] is usually used, as a simpler version. (Th e transcription 
you entered provisionally for pray /prei/ [prei] above becomes [pɹei].)
Now transcribe the following narrowly
 
4.27 rust /r
st/ [_____]
 
 thrust /θr
st/ [_____]
 
 drudge /dr
d/ [_____]
 
 trust /tr
st/ [_____]
 
 
*
Fronting, backing and rounding
 
 Th e exact place of articulation of a consonant can be aff ected by adjacent 
vowels or other consonants. For instance, /m/ is bilabial, but an adjustment 
typically takes place in informal conversation if /f, v/ follow immediately; the 
/m/ becomes as labiodental as the /f, v/: test it out on comfort, some verses. Th e 
lower lip ‘backs’ towards the upper teeth and so in a technical, phonetic, sense, 
it has become labiodental; there is a special IPA symbol for a labiodental nasal: 

66
PART ONE
Words
[]. So comfort /k
mfət/ in narrow transcription is [kh
fəʔth,kh
fəʔ]; 
some verses /səm vsəz/ is [sə vsəz]. Similarly /n/ before /f, v/ also 
becomes labiodental; the articulation is ‘fronted’; inform, in verse /infɔm/, 
/in vs/ in narrow transcription are [ifɔm], [i vs]. In these cases, 
the fronting and backing are transcribed by a special phonetic symbol.
In other cases, the fronting and backing are indicated by diacritics. /n/ 
in like manner becomes dental before /θ, ð/; fronting (in this case, towards 
dental articulation) is transcribed by the diacritic [!]. Tenth, in there /tεnθ/, /
in ðεə/ in narrow transcription are [thεn!θ], [in! ðεə]. Th e consonants /k, / 
are fronted from a true velar position in the direction of the palatal position 
when followed immediately by front vowels, e.g. key, geese /ki/, /is/ are thus 
transcribed narrowly as [k"hi], ["is]. On the other hand, they are backed from 
a true velar position when followed immediately by back open vowels, e.g. car, 
guard /kɑ/, /ɑd/; in narrow transcription they become [khɑ], [ɑd].
Rounding, or labialization, of consonants occurs immediately before 
rounded vowels and /w/. Th e diacritic to show this is [w]. For example, soon, 
twin /ʃun/, /twin/ are, in narrow transcription, [swun], [twwin].
Fronting, backing and rounding are more or less automatic in English, 
and so it is usually not felt necessary to indicate them. Th ey are included here 
simply to alert you to their existence in case it should ever be necessary to 
include them in a narrow transcription.

Vowels
 
 Th ere are three processes that aff ect the articulation of all the vowels of English: 
nasalization, clipping and breaking; and two other processes that aff ect the 
articulation of just the long vowels: smoothing and diphthongization.

70
PART ONE
Words
Nasalization
 
 Vowels adjacent to nasal consonants ‘catch’ something of their nasal quality. 
Th is nasalization of the vowels is more or less automatic and would not nec-
essarily be transcribed. But if needed, the symbol is [˜]. So man /mn/ in 
narrow transcription is [m˜n]; sunk /s
#k/ is [s
˜#kh]; neat /nit/ is [n(˜)ʔth]. 
Nasalization in English is not phonemic as it is in French for instance; when 
French loan words are pronounced in English, some speakers choose to include 
the nasalization as in French, e.g. liaison /lieizɒ˜/ instead of the more usual /
lieizən/. Listen
 
4.28 /lieizɒ˜/
 
 
*
Clipping
 
 Clipping refers to the shortening of vowels in syllables that are closed with 
voiceless consonants. Th e length of a vowel – whether it is a short vowel, 
a long monophthong or a diphthong, or even a weak vowel – is roughly 
only half the length that it is in open syllables or syllables closed by voiced 
consonants. Th is clipping can, obviously, be recognized more easily in long 
vowels than in vowels that are by nature already relatively short. Clipping 
does not alter the quality of the vowel, so no change to the symbol is neces-
sary. If it is necessary to mark clipping, this can be done by replacing [] 
with [)] with long vowels, and by adding [˘] over short and diphthongal 
vowels.
Listen to the diff erence in the length of the vowel in sea, seat. Both are tran-
scribed with the vowel /i/ in a broad transcription, but it is possible to show 
the allophonic diff erence in a narrow transcription: [si], [si)ʔth]. Also side, 
sight (site/cite), and Sid, sit: [said], [sai˘ʔth]; [sid], [si˘ʔth].
 
 
*
Breaking
 
 Breaking refers to the transitional sound between a vowel and a dark /l/ []. 
It was referred to on p. 47 with an explanation that the transitional sound is 
similar to /ə/. In a narrow transcription, breaking is indicated by that symbol, 
but raised: [ə] to show that it does not constitute a separate syllable. So the 
examples given there are transcribed narrowly as
 
 feel /fil/ [fiə]
 
 fool /ful/ [fuə]
 
 fail /feil/ [feiə]
 
 Now transcribe the others:
 
 fi le/phial /fail/ [  ]
 
 foil /fɔil/ [  ]

71
CHAPTER 4
Allophones
 
 foal /fəυl/ [  ]
 
 foul/fowl /faυl/ [  ]
 
 Historically, something similar happened before /r/. Modern SESP has serious, 
furious, various as
 
4.29 /siəriəs/, /fjυəriəs/, /vεəriəs/
 
 but other accents still retain a long monophthong before /r/:
 
4.30 /siriəs/, /fjuriəs/, /vεriəs/
 
 Again historically, when /r/ was lost in SESP, the ‘breaking’ to [ə] remained, pro-
ducing the centring diphthongs: /iə, υə, εə/(and also /ɔə/ in some accents still).
 
 
*
Smoothing
 
 Th e tongue movement for long vowels, whether monophthong or diphthong, 
may be reduced when followed by a weak vowel. For example, the word hour 
has a closing diphthong /aυ/ before the weak vowel /ə/; some speakers choose 
to reduce the amount of tongue movement by ‘smoothing’ out the closing 
movement of the diphthong, reducing the articulation to [aə]. (Many speakers 
reduce the tongue movement even further with the possessive determiner our 
/ɑ/!). liable /laiəbəl/ becomes [laəbə]. Listen:
 
4.31 liable
 
 Th us some speakers make no distinction between tower /taυə/ and tire /taiə/: 
[thaə]; others do maintain a diff erence with distinct starting positions:
 
4.32 [thɑə], [thaə].
 
 ruin likewise may be either /ruin/ or /rυin/; listen for the diff erence:
 
4.33 ruin
 
 Th e latter shows how the tongue movement from a long monophthong to 
a weak vowel can be ‘smoothed’. foreseeable may be either /fɔsiəbəl/ or 
/fɔsiəbəl/:
 
4.34 foreseeable
 
 
*
Diphthongization
 
 Th e two close long monophthongs /i, u/ are liable to diphthongization. 
Instead of a steady tongue position, there is a tendency to start from a rela-
tively open position and move to the close position: [ii, υu]. Listen to a fairly 
common pronunciation of the words tea, too:

72
PART ONE
Words
 
4.35 [thii], [thυu]
 
 Th e descriptions of smoothing and diphthongization touch upon alternative 
pronunciations that speakers may adopt, and so we begin to enter the area of 
accents, which is the next big topic that we need to deal with.

73
 
5 Accents
 
 Everybody speaks diff erently – even identical twins! People with the same 
English accent have the same phonological system and a high degree of con-
sistency in articulation, but their voices are still distinctly diff erent. It might 
be possible to transcribe all these individual diff erences – voice quality, pitch 
level, tone, speed, etc., but our interest is the transcription of more general 
properties of pronunciation.
An accent indicates a person’s identifi cation with a community of people. 
English accents vary according to geography – national and regional types, e.g. 
British, American, Indian, Scottish, English Midlands, North Walian English, 
Ulster and so on. We could add here foreign accents too; non-native speakers 
of English share particular features with others from the same linguistic back-
ground. Accents also vary in a historical perspective; the pronunciation of the 
younger generation of today sounds quite diff erent in some respects from that 
of their grandparents, for instance. Th is is how historical change comes about 
over the centuries, with slight changes of pronunciation in successive genera-
tions. Accents also vary socially; typically, dockers and doctors from the same 
city are expected to sound very diff erent. Th ere are also gender diff erences; 
think of the way many young women say ‘Th ank you’, with a vowel that seems 
half way to saying ‘Th ank ye’; most British men do not pronounce that phrase 
with that kind of vowel change. Finally, there are stylistic variations, where 
pronunciation changes according to the formality of the setting; ‘Do you want 
a cup of tea?’ can sound more like ‘Joanna Cupper’ in an informal setting!
Whatever type of accent – geographical, foreign, historical, social or stylistic 
– diff erences between them can be categorized in four ways. One accent may 
diff er from another in their phonological inventories. For instance, SESP has 
the vowel phoneme /
/ in a word like strut, but many people with a Northern 
English accent use the vowel /υ/ instead and simply never the use the /
/ vowel; 
there is no /
/ in their system at all. Look back at p. 16. Th ey have therefore a 
diff erent phonological system. It is also well known that the so-called General 
American accent does not include the vowel phoneme /ɒ/ – another instance 
of a phonological inventory diff erence.
One accent may also diff er from another in phonetic features. Younger 
speakers of SESP pronounce trap with an opener vowel [a] than older speakers 
of SESP [] – think of the Queen! Look back at p. 13. Th is is a phonetic varia-
tion of the same phoneme, so this is not a diff erence in inventories. Also, many 
working-class Londoners regularly pronounce /t/ as [ʔ] in the middle and at 

74
PART ONE
Words
the end of words as in hot water (see p. 63). Th e [ʔ] is a phonetic variation in this 
context to [th]; it is not an extra phoneme in the inventory. Th at fi nal vowel in
 
5.1 thank you
 
 as pronounced by many young women is a more central close vowel: [u+] or 
[υ]; again, this is not an extra phoneme, but a phonetic variation of /u/ in the 
context of the /j/ consonant.
An accent may also diff er in the way a phoneme may be distributed, i.e. in 
the places in a word where it can occur. Th is distributional variation may be 
phonological or lexical. A well-known example of phonological distribution 
diff erences is the distinction between rhotic and non-rhotic accents. Southern 
England Standard Pronunciation, as we have seen, is non-rhotic in that the 
phoneme /r/ cannot occur before a consonant or before silence. Th e General 
American (GA) accent, which is rhotic, has the same phoneme /r/ but it does 
allow it to occur before a consonant and before silence; the diff erence is simply 
distributional. Farm in GA is /fɑrm/; in SESP it is /fɑm/. Th ere is no diff er-
ence in the inventories of phonemes in the two accents, nor necessarily a diff er-
ence in phonetic form; merely a diff erence in the distribution of that particular 
phoneme. Another example was touched on on p. 71: the vowel phoneme /i/ 
can appear before /r/ in some accents as in serious, but in SESP it cannot; the 
vowel before /r/ must be /iə/ in SESP. Th is again is a distributional diff erence; 
the phoneme inventory is no diff erent, nor the phonetic realization of either 
vowel.
Lexical distribution refers to instances where a phoneme can appear in the 
same phonological context as a rule, but not in a particular word or group of 
words. Southern England Standard Pronunciation and most other accents in 
Britain allow both /θ, ð/ in word-fi nal position, but whereas most accents in 
England and Wales have /ð/ at the end of with, most Scottish accents have /θ/. 
In this case, the ‘choice’ of phoneme depends on the particular word. Another 
well-known lexical distribution diff erence distinguishes SESP from many other 
accents in Britain; there is a group of words that take /ɑ/ typically in words 
that have a voiceless consonant following, e.g. class, whereas other accents take 
//. But we cannot establish a rule for all such cases because even SESP has 
/ms/ for mass; and nasty /nɑsti/ and pasty /psti/ do not rhyme in SESP. 
Look back at p. 20. So there is no general rule that establishes a diff erence in the 
phonological distribution of the two vowels; rather, it depends on the selection 
of the word(s) – it is a case of a diff erent lexical distribution.
Th ese four kinds of diff erence aff ect both consonants and vowels, and also 
word stress. Th ere are a number of instances of word stress diff erences between 
British and American accents. Consider these few words:
 
5.2 frustrate, cremate, vacate
 
 In two-syllable verbs of this kind ending in /-eit/, British speakers place the 
primary stress on that fi nal syllable: /fr
streit/; /krəmeit/; /vəkeit/; 
whereas American speakers tend to place the primary stress on the fi rst syllable:

75
CHAPTER 5
Accents
 
5.3 /fr
streit/; /krimeit/; /veikeit/
 
 Th is is a case of phonological distribution. So is the diff erence between British 
secondary /sεkəndri/ and American /sεkəndεri/; and all those words 
that have fi nal <-ary>, <-ery>, <-ory> and <-ury> without primary stress. A 
lexical diff erence is found in the noun address: British /ədrεs/ and American 
/drεs/. Compare also
 
 aristocrat: British /ristəkrt/; American /əristəkrt/
 
 harass: British /hrəs/; American /hərs/
 
 magazine : British /məzin/; American /məzin/.
  
5.4 address, aristocrat, harass, magazine
 
Lexical sets
 
 To illustrate all these variations and give you some practice in observing them 
and transcribing them, ten English speakers were recorded reading a set of 
words in their diff erent accents, and then an eleventh person who speaks 
English as a foreign language was added. Th eir accents diff er in geography, 
social class, generation, gender and in linguistic background. Th eir voices are 
not meant to necessarily represent a stereotypical accent, so not every well-
known feature of a particular accent may be present in their pronunciation. 
Th e recordings were made in natural settings, not in a studio; the spoken data 
that you may have to transcribe one day will almost certainly be recorded in 
natural settings, and you will have to contend with a certain amount of back-
ground noise, like the hum of a kitchen fridge, a mobile phone ringing, a door 
opening, etc.
Th e eleven accents are, fi rst, from the USA, then four regions of England 
(London, the West Country, the Midlands and the North) and three other 
countries within the UK – Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – followed 
by two speakers of English as a second language, from Africa and India, and 
fi nally, a Chinese visitor to UK, representing a foreign accent.
Th ey all use the same words, more or less, so that you can compare their 
pronunciation, particularly of the vowels, in a methodical way. Th ese lexical 
sets have been chosen to represent typical variations in the way vowels are 
pronounced across a wide spectrum of English accents. Th e idea of lexical sets 
derives from the work of John Wells (see especially Wells 1982); each word 
contains one particular vowel, which varies across a number of accents. Th e 
lexical set in this workbook follows in the main the words chosen in Chapter 
1. Th e thirty words represent diff erent aspects of vowel articulation and so it is 
necessary to listen carefully for any variations from the qualities that have been 
practised and transcribed so far. Th e thirty words are:
 
5.5  1. lick
 
  2. leg
 
  3. lack
 
  4. lock

 Th e fi rst six words contain the short vowels. Listen for vowel quality: note that 
some accents do not distinguish all six (i.e. diff erences in phonological inven-
tories). Listen also for vowel quantity; are some vowels sometimes pronounced 
long?
Th e next words from 7 to 25 contain the long vowels: monophthongs and 
diphthongs (front closing, back closing and centring). Listen particularly to 
variations in quality: some diphthongs are pronounced as monophthongs, and 
some monophthongs as diphthongs with a bit of a glide. Some accents dis-
tinguish blew from blue; listen for distinctions in other such pairs of words 
too (i.e., again, diff erences in phonological inventories). Listen also for varia-
tions in quantity, especially as some pronunciations are rhotic (i.e. diff erences 
in phonological distribution). You might notice variations in the pronun-
ciation of /r/ as well (i.e. phonetic realization). What about the /l/ in Paul? 
Is it pronounced, and if so, how? Listen out for other phonetic variations of 
 consonants,  especially among the non-native speakers of English.
Th e fi nal fi ve contain the weak vowels: /i/ in fi nal position and before 
another vowel; /u/, and fi nal /ə/. Do the very last two words rhyme in your 
accent? Do they rhyme for all of the speakers?

Th ese are the main things to listen for. Try and transcribe each word in full, 
or at least identify the phonetic quality of the vowels using a narrow transcrip-
tion where necessary. You will fi nd a key and some general remarks in the 
appendix, but DO NOT look at them before you have listened to some of the 
voices and attempted a transcription. Try and transcribe a few of them, if not 
all of them!

West Country
 
 Lisa is a housewife and gardener, in her 40s, from Fishponds, Bristol. Listen 
to whether her accent is rhotic or not. A well-known feature of the Bristolian 
accent is the tendency to add /l/ to words ending in a vowel; for that reason, 
item 23 was changed to idea, to see whether she does. Does she? Does she add 
it to drama? What happens to the fi nal /l/ in Paul? How are Paul and poor 
 distinguished, compared to the Londoner’s voice?

Wales
 
 Gordon is a retired sub-postmaster, in his 60s, from Aberdare, South Wales. He 
is bilingual. Welsh is ‘rhotic’ phonologically; listen to see whether his English 
therefore is also rhotic. For him, blew is pronounced diff erently from blue; so 
blue replaces Luke as item 12, so that you can observe the diff erence. Know and 
no are also diff erent for him; so no replaces load, so that you can observe that 
diff erence too. Similarly, waste is diff erent from waist; however, there is only 
the merest hint of the diff erence in this recording; waste replaces lake. Also, 
listen carefully to his rendering of the SESP centring diphthongs; which words 
seem to be pronounced as two syllables?

 Jennifer is a trainee food technologist, in her 20s, from Armagh. Her pronun-
ciation is in some ways the most diffi  cult to transcribe! Can you hear a dif-
ference from SESP in vowel quality in the very fi rst word, and a diff erence in 
vowel quantity in the second? What vowel quality do you hear in item 6? Is her 
accent rhotic? Check for /r/ before consonants (items 8, 10, 14), and then in 
fi nal position (23–25, 29). For her, the vowels in Luke and blew are diff erent, 
but not in quite the same way as for the Welsh speaker. Listen for diff erences 
in waist and lake too. You might then expect the vowels in know and load also 
to be diff erent; but are they? How many syllables do you hear in items 23–25? 
Finally, in what ways do the fi nal two words diff er?

 Judy is an administrator in UK higher education, in her 40s, from the Luhya 
speaking region of Kenya; she also speaks Swahili. Luhya and Swahili have 
much simpler vowel systems than English; what evidence of that fact appears 
in her pronunciation of English? One clue is that the distinction between short 
and long vowels is hardly noticeable in her pronunciation of English. Listen 
also for any diff erence there might be between the vowels of Luke and blew; 
waist and lake; and know and no.

 Bhaskarrao is a postman, in his 60s, from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. 
He has been in UK for about 15 years. His fi rst language is Telegu; he also 
speaks Hindi and Urdu, which all have simpler vowel systems than English, 
and evidence of that will appear in his pronunciation. You might notice that 
initial plosives are not aspirated, whereas fi nal plosives are; check on how to 
transcribe the diff erence in narrow transcription. Is his accent rhotic? In some 
cases it is diffi  cult to tell, but in items 23–25, it is quite clear; but is the /r/ a 
tap [ɾ] or an approximant [ɹ]? His pronunciation of pier follows spelling and 
maybe idiosyncratic; he confi rmed he knew what the word referred to. Finally, 
note how the fi nal two words diff er.

the very fi rst two words. Notice how varied the vowel length is in his pronun-
ciation of SESP long vowels. Th e open transition between /b/ and /l/ in blew is

Where is the word stress in his pronunciation of Louise? Finally, the fi nal two

CHAPTER 5
Accents
Chapters 4 and 5 contain a lot of technical detail and are pitched at a more 
advanced academic level than the preceding three chapters. We now return to 
a more gentle style for novices in transcription as we move on beyond indi-
vidual words to combinations of words in phrases, focusing mainly on a broad 
transcription again.

88
 
6 Phrases
 
 Words do not usually come by themselves, but are accompanied by many 
others! As words come together, they aff ect each other, usually to make the 
transition between one word and the next smoother.
Take a simple example like Ten green bottles. Most people would recognize 
this phrase as the title of an old song and would probably say it quickly and 
without any hesitation. As they did so, they probably would not notice that the 
pronunciation of ten and green changes because of the contact each has with 
adjacent words. In this case, ten would probably be pronounced with its /n/ 
changing to /ŋ/ in anticipation of its contact with the // of green; and green 
would probably be pronounced with its /n/ changing to /m/ in anticipation of 
its contact with the /b/ of bottles. Th ese kinds of change refl ect a process known 
as simplifi cation, which is the equivalent in pronunciation to processes like 
economy of eff ort, or ‘cutting corners’, in other spheres of life. In these cases, 
the two /n/s have changed to suit their contexts by becoming a little bit more 
similar to the consonants that follow in the next word.
Other ways of ‘cutting corners’ in pronunciation include leaving sounds 
out or putting extra ‘transitional’ sounds in to facilitate smooth contacts. 
Th ese simplifi cation processes are typical of most informal conversational 
speech, which is what we engage in most of the time when we are talking. 
Th ey can, however, be countered if the need is felt for a precise articulation 
in informal conversation and, in any case, in more formal speech. We will 
be assuming an informal conversational style of speech for the most part in 
this Chapter.
 
 
*
 
Assimilation
 
 Th e adjustment of the articulation of words as a consequence of their immedi-
ate spoken environment can happen in various ways. When an adjustment is 
made to accommodate an actual phonetic feature in the immediate environ-
ment, that process of simplifi cation is known as assimilation. Th e adjustment 
makes the phoneme more similar to its environment. Th e adjustment of the 
/n/ in ten to the velar articulation of the // in green is a case of assimilation: the 
/n/ becomes velar /ŋ/ which shares an identical feature with the velar articula-
tion of //. Similarly, the /n/ of green becomes bilabial /m/ in anticipation of 
the bilabial articulation of /b/ in bottles.

89
CHAPTER 6
Phrases
Word-fi nal /n/ regularly adjusts itself in English to the anticipated point 
of articulation of the consonant at the beginning of the next word. Th ink of 
common phrases with the prepositions on and in which are followed by words 
beginning with bilabial /p, b, m/ and you will notice that the /n/ easily adjusts 
itself to /m/ in anticipation.
 
6.1 on purpose   /ɒm ppəs/   in person   /im psn/

 on balance 
_______ 
in Bristol 
_______
 
 on Monday 
_______ 
in March 
_______
 
 on my behalf _______ 
in medicine _______
 
 Notice that in cases like on Monday and in March, there is a ‘double’ /mm/, a 
single articulation of double length to account for the fi nal /m/ of on and in and 
the initial /m/ of the following word. Otherwise it would sound like
 
6.3 om unday 
im arch
 
 which does not sound typical of native English speech.
In a parallel way, word-fi nal /n/ easily adjusts to a velar /ŋ/ in anticipation 
of following velar consonants /k, /.
 
6.4 on call 
/ɒŋ kɔl/ 
in case

7 cases 
_______
 
 All these cases of /n/ assimilation involve adjustments from one phoneme, /n/, 
to another, /m, ŋ/. Th ese are instances of phonemic assimilation. But the same 
kind of assimilation occurs in
 
6.8 in fun 
ten things 
sunrise 
in waves
 
 in fact 
one thought 
on show 
on Wednesday
 
 on vacation 
in there 
John Jones 
runway
 
 in verse 
in theory 
in use

 But the resulting articulation from the assimilation process is not identical to 
an existing phoneme: there is the labiodental nasal [] before the labiodental 
/f, v/, the dental nasal [n!] before the dental /θ, ð/, and either a post- alveolar 
or palatal nasal [#] before /r, ʃ, tʃ, d, j/. Look back at pp. 65–66. Th ese are 
instances of allophonic assimilation, since the adjustments do not coincide 
with other identifi able phonemes, and so are not recorded in a  phonemic 
 transcription.
Assimilation of fi nal /n/ is common in many other languages, including 
Latin, where the bilabial assimilation was actually expressed in the orthogra-
phy: in + possibilis > impossibilis. As a result we have spellings like impossible,

 Assimilation of fi nal /d/ in English is almost parallel to that of /n/, but this is 
not matched in many other languages. Th e /d/ becomes bilabial /b/ – retain-
ing its voicing – before bilabial /p, b, m/, and becomes velar // before velar 
/k, /. (Th is is true of most English accents, though West Walian English is an 
 exception.) Notice the process in
 
6.9 bad penny 
/bb pεni/ 
red kite 
/rε kait/
 
 good boy 
_________ 
bad girl 
_________
 
 red meat 
_________ 
good gracious _________
 
 Notice it too in the greetings:
 
6.10 good morning /υb mɔniŋ/ goodbye /υb bai/
 
 Notice that in cases like good boy, goodbye, there is a ‘double’ /bb/ – a single 
articulation of double length to account for the fi nal /b/ in /υb/ and the initial 
/b/ of the following word; likewise, a ‘double’ // in bad girl.
But fi nal /d/ may also for some speakers become post-alveolar /d/ before 
palatal /j/. Notice the process in
 
6.11 a bad year /ə bd j/ 
good use 
/υd jus/
 
 Note the subtle diff erence in articulation between good use and

91
CHAPTER 6
Phrases
 
6.12 good juice /υd dus/
 
 Historically, this post-alveolar assimilation of /d/ before /j/ accounts for the 
/d/ in words like
 
6.13 grandeur, verdure, soldier
 
 and, more recently, in
 
 educate, gradual
 
 (Standard South Walian English keeps the /dj/ sequence in soldier: /səυldjə/.) 
Many transfer this process also to the beginnings of words as in
 
6.14 due, duty /du/, /duti/
 
 Note that this historical instance of assimilation does not apply in US English.
Th e same kind of allophonic assimilation occurs in phrases like
 
6.15 good fun   a bad thing   a red shirt
 
 which we noted with /n/ above.
 
 
*
 
 Assimilation of fi nal /t/ in English used to be exactly parallel to assimilation of 
fi nal /d/, producing /p/ and /k/ – retaining voicelessness – before bilabial /b, 
d, m/ and velar /k, /. Th us hot potato would be /hɒp pəteitəυ/ and white 
cross /waik krɒs/. But a new tendency has developed and that is to articulate 
fi nal /t/ as a glottal stop [ʔ]. Look back at p. 63. Th is produces hot as [hɒʔ] and 
white as [waiʔ], which eliminates any possibility of assimilation. Listen to the 
two possibilities in the following phrases:
 
6.16 hot [ʔ] potato 
hot /p/ potato 
white [ʔ] cross 
white /k/ cross
 
 not [ʔ] bad 
not /p/ bad 
eight [ʔ] goals 
eight /k/ goals
 
 right [ʔ] mess 
right /p/ mess
 
 Similarly, two possibilities before /j/, where the /t/ could assimilate to post-
alveolar /tĂ/ or not
 
6.17 right [ʔ] use  right /tĂ/ use
 
 Historically, this post-alveolar assimilation to /tĂ/ before /j/ accounts for the 
/tĂ/ in words like
 
6.18 venture, picture, question
 
 and, more recently, in
 
 situation, actual.
 
 Many transfer this process – as for /d/ + /j/ – to the beginnings of words like
 
6.19 tune, Tuesday
 
 (One chocolate fi rm recently ran a series of adverts relying on the popular 
 perception of this tendency:

 Listen also for the distinction between words like light (with glottal stop) and 
lie, right (with glottal stop) and rye, etc., in these phrases

 right bread 
rye bread 
hurt feelings

 and the subtle diff erence in articulation between
 
6.22 white shoes 
waiʔ ʃuz why choose 
wai tʃuz
 
 Historically, the older tendency to assimilate may well account for the frequent 
mis-spelling of utmost as *upmost. No doubt, the sense of the word and the 
analogy with uppermost also contributed. (West Walian English is again an 
exception, where a fully articulated /t/ is usual in all these contexts.)

 Notice that in cases like this shop, bus shelter, there is a ‘double’ /ĂĂ/ to account 
for the /Ă/ assimilation at the end of the fi rst word and the /Ă/ at the beginning

Historically, this post-alveolar assimilation of /s, z/ before /j/ accounts for 
the /Ă, / in words like
 
6.24 pressure, mission and pleasure, vision
 
 and, more recently, in
 
 issue, usual.
 
 It also accounts for the /Ă/ at the beginning of words like sure, sugar. Notice 
also how /s/ readily assimilates to /Ă/ before the /tĂ/ in words like
 
6.25 mischief /miʃtʃif/, question /kwεʃtʃən/, Christian /kriʃtʃən/
 
 You will have noticed how /t, d, s, z/ all yield to the post-alveolar assimilation 
process before /j/. Th is is particularly noticeable when the following word is 
you or your, and is easily demonstrated in the following phrases

 If the word you or your is unstressed (see pp. 34–35) not only does the assimi-

but the /d/ and /j/ actually coalesce: /did u/, /ju hd ɔ tʃɑns/. However 
if the word you or your is stressed, as, for example, in emphasis or contrast, the 
/j/ is retained:
 
6.27 /did ju/, /ju hd jɔ tʃɑns/
 
 Notice, then, these cases where you/your is unstressed

 All the cases of assimilation we have considered so far involve an adjustment in 
the place of articulation in anticipation of (or in coalescence with) an immedi-
ately following consonant. Th e words have to belong to a phrase or a close knit 
syntactic structure within a clause. Assimilation oft en operates when a pause 
of hesitation interrupts the pronunciation of a phrase, like he’s gone . by bus 
/...ɒm . bai... / . But it does not operate when the pause realizes the boundary 
between two clauses: how has he gone? By bus? /...ɒn . bai.../.
 
 
*
 
 A quite diff erent case of assimilation involves an adjustment in voicing. A 
voiced fricative in word-fi nal position oft en loses its voicing, either partially 
or fully, if the next word begins with a voiceless consonant. For instance, fi nal 
/v/ in have may weaken to a partially devoiced [v] before a voiceless conso-
nant in a phrase like have to, or it may weaken with full devoicing and become 
 identical to /f/. Listen to the two possibilities:

94
PART ONE
Words
 
6.30 [hv tu] 
[hf tu]
 
 Similarly, fi nal /z/, e.g. has to
 
 [hz tu] 
[hs tu]
 
 Th e partial devoicing process is a case of allophonic assimilation, but the full 
devoicing process amounts to phonemic assimilation. Notice that the /v/ of of, 
the / /ࠐof with, the /z/ of is, was can all be aff ected.
 
 of course [v, f] 
with care [ð, θ] 
he’s too bad [z, s]
 
  
with support [ð, θ] 
she was fi ne [z, s]
 
 In the following cases, note once again the tendency for a single articulation of 
‘double’ length to account for the assimilated consonant at the end of one word 
and an identical consonant at the beginning of the following word.
 
 
full of fun    with thanks    that was so nice
 
 Th e devoicing tendency oft en occurs within a word, at the juncture of two 
morphemes, in parallel situations. Th us withstand /wiðstnd/ becomes 
[wiðstnd] or /wiθstnd/, and absent /bsnt/ becomes either [bsnt] or 
/psnt/. Likewise subsist, absolutely, obscene, newspaper. In the word absurd, 
two alternative assimilation processes may be heard: either the /b/ becoming 
[b] or /p/; or the /s/ becoming /z/: /psd/ or / bzd /.
 
 
*
 
 Th at second alternative – the voicing option – is frequently heard in other cases 
where a voiceless fricative, particularly /s, Ă/, between voiced sounds becomes 
voiced itself. A well-known example is the change that has happened to the 
name Asia, where /ʃ/ has begun to give way to //:
 
6.31 /eiʃə/, /eiə/; version /vʃən/, /vən/; resource /risɔs/, /rizɔs/; 
transit /trnsit/, /trnzit/; Muslim /mυslim/ to /mυzlim/
 
 
*
 
 Th ese are the main cases of assimilation in English. Assimilation – phonemic 
or allophonic – is usually anticipatory: it anticipates either the adjustment in 
the place of articulation of fi nal /n, d, t, s, z/ before certain consonants, or the 
devoicing of fricatives (and occasionally, plosives) before voiceless consonants. 
Assimilation is also occasionally coalescent: when two successive consonants 
aff ect each other as in cases like /d/ followed by /j/ as in did you? /did u/.
But there is one other instance of assimilation in English where an adjust-
ment is made that retains the place of articulation of a preceding consonant. 
Th is happens regularly in the word happen! If no vowel follows, the fi nal 
/n/ becomes syllabic and adjusts to the bilabial articulation of /p/: /hpm /; 
also: happens /hpm z/, happened /hpm d/, but not in happening, where the 
/n/ is not syllabic: /hpniŋ/. Look back at p. 52. Th is kind of assimilation is 
called retentive or perseverative, and is relatively rare in English – although it 

95
CHAPTER 6
Phrases
is common in other languages. Other occasional instances in English include 
the possibility of open /əυpən/ becoming /əυpm /; opens /əυpənz/ becoming 
/əυpm z/ and opened /əυpənd/ becoming /əυpm d/; but opening /əυpniŋ/ 
keeps the non-syllabic /n/.
 
Elision
 
 A second type of simplifi cation involves not an adjustment to a sound, but its 
complete removal. Th is is known as elision; the missing sound is said to have 
been elided. Take the name Christmas as an example; it used to be a compound 
consisting of Christ and mass, but in the course of time, the /t/ of the fi rst word 
has been elided, and nowadays nobody would normally pronounce the name 
with a /t/. Similarly, the word handkerchief used to be a compound consisting 
of hand and kerchief, but again in the course of time the /d/ of the fi rst word has 
been elided.
As it happens, elision mainly aff ects fi nal /t, d/ if they are preceded by a con-
sonant – as in the cases above – and also followed by a word beginning with a 
consonant – again, as in the cases above.
First of all, we will consider the elision of fi nal /d/. Notice what has  happened 
to the /d/ in these other (formerly compound) words:
 
6.32 handsome, sandwich, grandfather, grandchildren
 
 Notice too that as /d/ is elided in grandparents, the preceding /n/ is adjacent to 
a bilabial consonant and assimilates to /p/ by becoming /m/:
 
6.33 /rmpεərənts/
 
 Try and transcribe:

 Th e fact that the elision of /d/ makes some of these words identical to others 
(while, goal, foal) does not seem to trouble native English speakers, as the 
context usually makes it quite clear which word is intended. Occasionally, 
there is potential ambiguity as in cold shed/coal shed, but again, usually the 
context is clear. Elision is sometimes expressed in ‘popular’ spelling, e.g. Ol’ 
King Cole, Ole Man River.
 
 Elision, however, does not take place if the following consonant is /h/, such as 
in

 Th us, /d/ elision takes place if it is word-fi nal, preceded by a consonant and fol-

exceptions). It also takes place if a suffi  x follows which begins with the right 
kind of consonant. Th us /d/ is elided in friends, and may optionally be elided 
in friendly. What about these words?

 Th e past-tense suffi  x <-ed> is pronounced /d/ aft er voiced consonants other 
than /d/ itself (see p. 53). If the immediately following word begins with a con-
sonant that causes elision, then the past tense suffi  x itself is elided. Th is means 
that the verb actually loses its tense marker; again, native English  speakers do 

97
CHAPTER 6
Phrases
not appear to be particularly bothered by this, since there will probably be 
enough in the context to indicate which tense is intended. So, for example, 
in I warned them, the conditions are right for elision to take place, leaving the 
spoken equivalent of I warn them. Naturally, a person may decide to make the 
suffi  x noticeable by articulating the /d/ in an exaggerated way, but this is not 
normal in most ordinary, typical, informal colloquial speech. Transcribe the

 Elision, in English, mainly involves fi nal /t, d/ when preceded by a consonant 
(a voiceless one in the case of /t/) and followed immediately by a word begin-
ning with certain consonants. It also happens regularly to the /k/ of ask when 
followed immediately by any elision-inducing consonants. All the features of 
/t/ elision apply:
 
6.52 Ask me a question

 but /k/ is not elided if it would bring two /s/s together:
 
6.53 She always asks many questions
 
 and may happen in
 
6.54 She’ll ask loads of questions
 
 /k/ elision is restricted to the verb ask, no doubt because it is used so frequently. 
It does not normally happen in words like risk, e.g. risked, or task, e.g. task 
force.
Th ere are certain other cases of elision as a consequence of rhythm, but they 
will be dealt with in Chapter 7.
 
Epenthesis
 
 Having considered elision – the loss of a sound – as a process of simplifi cation, 
it might seem strange to consider the addition of a sound as another way of 
simplifying pronunciation. But there are some such cases in English.
Consider the word young. Its fi nal consonant is a voiced velar nasal /ŋ/. Now 
consider the derived form youngster. You will notice that the ending begins 
with /s/, a voiceless alveolar fricative. Th e /s/ articulation is diff erent in every 
respect from the /ŋ/ articulation; /s/ is voiceless, /ŋ/ is voiced; /s/ is oral, in the 
sense that the soft  palate is raised, /ŋ/ is nasal, with the soft  palate lowered; /s/ 
is fricative, with a partial closure in the mouth, /ŋ/ requires complete closure; 
and /s/ is alveolar, with the blade of the tongue against the teeth ridge, /ŋ/ is 
velar, with the back of the tongue against the soft  palate. Th us, the transition to 
/s/ from /ŋ/ involves four changes: at the vocal folds, with the soft  palate, with a 
diff erent degree of closure with a diff erent part of the tongue. In careful speech, 
it is quite possible to synchronize all these movements, but many people in 
ordinary, typical, informal colloquial speech do not. What happens in their 
case is that the changes at the vocal folds and with the soft  palate are engaged 
fi rst, and then the tongue ‘catches up’ aft erwards. In other words, the transition 
from /ŋ/ to /s/ is staggered, with the result that an extra – transitional – sound 
is produced. Th at ‘transitional’ sound has the voicelessness and ‘orality’ of /s/ 
but the tongue position of the /ŋ/, and is thus identical to the articulation of 
the English consonant /k/.

A third parallel case of epenthesis happens in monster. Although /n/ and /s/ 
share an alveolar point of articulation, the tongue changes from a fl at ‘broad’ 
contact to a grooved shape. As in the other transitions, the tongue movement 
may lag behind, leaving the fl at ‘broad’ contact fractionally longer; this helps to 
produce a transitional /t/.

patients! Try triumph, triumphal, triumphant without, and with, epenthetic 
/p/. What about circumference?
Finally, consider the sequence of nasal + voiceless fricatives in names. 
Th e son of Sam is either Samson, or Sampson – with epenthetic /p/; similarly 
Simson and Simpson, Th omson and Th ompson. (Not, you note, the sons of 
Samp, Simp and Th omp!) Epenthetic /p/ has been realized historically in the 
place names Hampstead, Hampton, Hampshire, Kempton. Epenthetic /t/ or /k/ 
is oft en pronounced (but not spelt) in names like Benson, Hanson, Johnson, 
Langton, Langford.
 
Liaison
 
 Liaison is another process which involves the addition of a sound. In this case, 
a speaker inserts a sound in order to ease the link between vowels at the end of 
one word and at the beginning of an immediately following word.
Th e most well-known case involves a historical <r> at the end of a word. 
In most British (‘non-rhotic’) accents, the <r> in a word like here is not pro-
nounced if there is either a consonant following in the next word, or silence. 
But if the immediately following word begins with a vowel, the <r> does get 
pronounced: here in Britain /hiər im britn/. Such an /r/ is traditionally 
known as a linking /r/, as speakers use it to link up the end of one word with 
the beginning of the next. Here are some more examples:

 Notice the kind of vowel that occurs in the fi rst column: /ɑ, iə, εə, ɔə, , ə/, 
all relatively open or mid, and back or central/centring. It is now very common 
for native English speakers to add /r/ to any word ending in these vowels when 
the immediately following word begins with a vowel – even if there is no ‘his-
torical’ /r/ in the spelling. Th ere was, in the 1960s and 70s, a fi erce contro-
versy as to whether this ‘non-historical’ /r/ liaison was acceptable in standard 
pronunciation, but it is now widely heard and accepted as a current form, 
based on the analogy of the ‘linking’ /r/. But because of that controversy, this 
‘non-historical’ case is usually referred to as the intrusive /r/. Here are some 
 examples:
 
6.62 spa 
/spɑ/ 
the spa is open 
/ðə spɑr iz əυpən/

 Although the ‘intrusive’ /r/ is added on the analogy of the ‘linking’ /r/, it is basi-
cally an identical process of liaison, easing the link between two vowels across 
a word boundary. For some speakers, the ‘intrusive’ /r/ eases the boundary 
between morphemes even within a word, e.g. drawing may become
 
6.63 /drɔriŋ/
 
 
*
 
 If a word ends in the vowels /i, i, ei, ai, ɔi/, some speakers use /j/ to link them 
to a vowel at the beginning of an immediately following word. And if a word 
ends in the vowels /u, u, aυ, əυ/, a /w/ is oft en used to produce a similar link.

Phrases
 
 Liaison with /r, j, w/ – the three approximants – eases the link between any 
fi nal vowel and any vowel at the beginning of an immediately following word. 
It is thus another type of simplifi cation process.
 
 
*
 
 We have now covered all four of the processes of simplifi cation that native 
speakers of English employ in ordinary, typical, informal colloquial speech. 
And we have transcribed plenty of examples of each type. But it must also 
be emphasized that this survey of simplifi cation processes applies to English, 
and not necessarily to other languages. Other languages may have processes 
that are parallel to the English ones, but they may very likely employ fewer, or 
 diff erent, or more processes than English does.
Remember too, native speakers have the option of not employing these 
simplifi cation processes, especially in a slow, deliberate style. Imagine, for 
instance, the opening announcement at a seminar.
 
6.66 Today our subject is Anne Boleyn   /...n bυlin/
 
 and compare it with a less formal style in a following statement of explanation

II . . . and Discourse
 
7 Rhythm
 
 Talk does not normally consist of single words. Sometimes it does, but much 
more oft en, talk consists of a vast number of words connected together in 
phrases, clauses, sentences, phonological paragraphs – in whole texts of dis-
course. An utterance that consists of a single word is usually a response like 
Yes, No, Well, Maybe, OK, Certainly, Absolutely, or Tench, Paul, Cardiff , 
British, Male . . . But in most talk, words pile upon each other and they aff ect 
the pronunciation of each other. We have seen some of the eff ects of words 
coming together in phrases in Chapter 6. But there is another kind of eff ect 
when words come together in phrases and clauses. Just as words have a stress 
pattern, phrases and clauses do too as they become part of real discourse.
Th ink again of the old song:
Ten green bottles
Hanging on the wall
And if one green bottle
Should accidentally fall
Th ere’d be nine green bottles
Hanging on the wall
 
 Each line has three beats, or stresses (printed in bold) which means that certain 
words and syllables are pronounced without stress (printed plain). In order to 
say these unstressed words quickly enough not to spoil the rhythm, they are 
usually pronounced with a weak vowel. And this means that certain words 
have at least two possible pronunciations – a strong form with a strong vowel, 
and a weak form with a weak vowel. Take the word and for example. Taken by 
itself, it is pronounced as /ænd/; this is its strong form. And it is sometimes 
pronounced like that in talk, for emphasis or contrast. But much more oft en, it 
is pronounced in a diff erent way, as in this song, as /ən/; this is its weak form. 
Th e choice between its strong or weak form depends upon its role in an utter-
ance; if it is just connecting words or clauses, it is usually pronounced in its 
weak form, but if someone wants to draw attention to the connection itself, 
it would be pronounced in its strong form. Th is is a choice at the level of dis-
course which is then refl ected in the degree of prominence that a person gives 
a word within a phrase or clause. As a general rule, lexical (or ‘content’) words 

106
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are made prominent because of their 
importance in a message, whereas grammatical (or ‘structure’) words like con-
junctions, prepositions, pronouns, determiners and auxiliary and modal verbs 
are usually pronounced without any prominence because their role is basically 
to provide structure to phrases and clauses in utterances. English rhythm, then, 
relates to the way in which unstressed syllables are integrated with the strong 
syllables of prominent words in discourse, to produce the pronunciation of 
phrases and clauses.
Most talk is conducted in an informal, rather rapid, colloquial style. 
Occasionally, talk is slow and formal, in which case the processes of simplifi ca-
tion would not necessarily operate. Sometimes, the pace of talk is reduced to 
dictation speed when even rhythm choices do not operate. If you had to dictate 
the Ten Green Bottles song, you would probably articulate all the words in their 
full forms. (Th e dots (.) indicate pausing.)
 
7.1 tεn . rin . bɒtlz
 
 hŋiŋ . ɒn . ðə . wɔl
 
 nd . if . w
n . rin . bɒtl
 
 ʃυd . ksi . dεntəli . fɔl
 
 ðεə . wυd . bi . nain . rin . bɒtl z
 
 hŋiŋ . ɒn . ðə . wɔl
 
 Contrast this pronunciation with the way you would probably sing it!
 
7.2 tεŋ rim bɒtl z
 
 hŋiŋ ɒn ðə wɔl
 
 ən if w
ŋ rim bɒtl

 ðə b bi naiŋ rim bɒtl z
 
 hŋiŋ ɒn ðə wɔl
 
 Obviously, normal, ordinary, informal, colloquial talk is not like singing with 
its carefully measured beat, but it is nevertheless marked by rhythm choices 
and simplifi cation processes as illustrated in the song.
So, just as words have stress patterns, so do phrases and clauses. Indeed, 
some words and phrases have identical patterns, for instance inaction and in 
action /inkʃən/, even indeed and in deed /indid/. Listen:
 
7.3 /inkʃən/, /indid/
 
 In our practice of the eff ects of rhythm in the pronunciation of discourse in 
English, we will concentrate on the grammatical items and begin with the 
prepositions.
 
Prepositions
 
 Prepositions have full forms and weak forms. Strong forms are used for 
 emphasis or contrast and when they occur at the ends of clauses:

107
CHAPTER 7
Rhythm
 
7.4 where are you fl ying to /tu/
 
 and travelling from /frɒm/
 
 which hotel are you staying at /t/
 
 how long are you going for /fɔ/
 
 But in ordinary prepositional phrases, they are usually unstressed.
 
7.5  I’m fl ying to /tə/ Glasgow
 
  
on /ɒm/ Monday
 
  
from /frəm/ Gatwick
 
  
with /wið/ a budget airline
 
  
staying at /ət/ the ‘Old Barn’
 
  
in /in/ in the city centre
 
  
for /fə/ the weekend
 
 Notice that the vowel in some prepositions changes to a weak vowel, like from 
/frəm/ and at /ət/, but in others like on, with, in it does not. In the case of to, 
the vowel changes to the neutral vowel if a consonant follows immediately, or 
to the weak vowel /tu/ before a vowel. Look back at p. 34. In the case of for, the 
vowel changes to the neutral vowel, but a linking /r/ is added as liaison before 
a following vowel. Now try these examples
 
7.6  fl ying to _______ San Francisco
 
  
from _______ Birmingham
 
  staying at _______ the ‘Old Castle’
 
  
for _______ two weeks
 
7.7  fl ying to _______ LA (/εl ei/)
 
  
from _______ Manchester
 
  staying at _______ the ‘Old Lodge’
 
  
for _______ a few days
 
 Th e preposition of has a strong form: /ɒ
/ for emphasis, contrast and the end 
position of a clause, e.g.
 
7.8 what’s he thinking of /ɒ
/
 
 and a weak form when unstressed /əv/
 
7.9 thinking of /əv/ his holidays
 
 Transcribe
 
7.10 what does his plan consist of ______
 
 a week of _____ sun in the south of ______ Spain, then climb to the top of 
____ the Rock of _____ Gibraltar, then a month of _____ hiking along the 
coast of ____ North Africa.
 
 Th e weak form is also oft en pronounced with /v/ elided, reducing it to /ə/. 
Historically, this is what has happened in telling the time, e.g. 2 o’clock /tu 
əklɒk/ for the older 2 of (the) clock. It is also what has happened in phrases 

108
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
like a cup of tea becoming a cuppa /k
pə /. An old advert to encourage the 
 drinking of milk was
 
 Drinka
 
 Pinta (= a pint of)

 Popular spellings of kind of and sort of as kinda, sorta display the same 
 observation.
 
7.11 you sort of /sɔt ə/ try
 
 it’s kind of /kaind ə/ nice
 
 Transcribe the following according to whether /ə

7.12 a cup of ________ coff ee at 11 o’_____ clock
 
 a cup of ________ tea at 4 o’_____ clock
 
 a pint of ________ beer at 8 o’ _____ clock
 
 a packet of ________ crisps at the end of _____ the day
 
 None of the other prepositions have special weak forms with a change of 
vowel; they are transcribed with a stress mark if stressed, and without it if 
unstressed.
 
7.13 we’re going through /θru/ France
 
 he said We’re going through /θru/ France, not to /tu/ France
 
 and we’re going for /fə/ two weeks, not in /in/ two weeks.
 
 and you need to check your passport before /bifɔ/, not aft er /ɑftə/.
 
 Transcribe
 
7.14 single to ___ Liverpool please
 
 the 8.25 for ____ Manchester will be leaving from _____Platform 1
 
 change at ___ Crewe for ____ all stations to __ Liverpool Lime Street
 
 we apologize that there’ll be a delay of __ ten minutes.
 
 
*
 
Conjunctions
 
 Th e most common conjunction is and. As we have already noted, its full form 
is /nd/ and its most frequent weak form is /ən/. Th e /n/ of its weak form is 
vulnerable to the process of assimilation, as in bed and breakfast
 
7.15 /bεb m brεkfəst/
 
 Transcribe and in these orders for breakfast
 
7.16 fruit and _____ breakfast cereals
 
 muesli and _____ cornfl akes
 
 eggs and _____ bacon

109
CHAPTER 7
Rhythm
 
 toast and _____ marmalade
 
 tea and _____ coff ee
 
 If you order ham and egg, note that you might possibly retain the /d/: either 
/ən/ or /ənd/. What about
 
7.17 grapefruit and ____ (or ____ ) orange?
 
 If the conditions are right, the /n/ may give way to a syllabic /n / (or /m /, as in 
bed and breakfast, or /ŋ /). Transcribe and in these suggestions for lunch
 
7.18 bread and cheese 
_____ 
soup and bread 
_____
 
 omelette and chips 
_____ 
roast pork and gravy 
_____
 
 cake and cream 
_____
 
 
*
 
 Th e conjunction or usually remains unchanged when unstressed, except in 
a few set phrases. When a genuine choice or alternative is being off ered, the 
 conjunction remains as /ɔ/ with the possibility of /r/ liaison as in
 
7.19 eat in or /ɔr/ out
 
 Notice the full form in
 
7.20 brown bread or ___ white
 
 tea or ___ coff ee
 
 with or ___ without
 
 but in set phrases like one or two, the conjunction may be reduced to /ə/. 
Compare
 
 (How long are you staying?)
 
7.21 two or /ə/ three days
 
 well, is it two or /ɔ/ three days
 
 well, when we’ve more or /ə/ less fi nished
 
 Similarly, with nor.
 
7.22 he’s not staying, and nor /nɔr/ are you
 
 a day or /ə/ two is neither here nor /nə/ there
 
 
*
 
 Th e conjunction but /b
t/ is weakened to /bət/ when unstressed. In these it is 
unstressed:
 
7.23 the weather will be dry but /bət/ cold
 
  
wet but ____ mild
 
  
warm at fi rst, but ____ cold later
 
  you should be all right, but ____ take an umbrella just in case
 
 But is stressed when a speaker wants to emphasize a contrast:

110
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
7.24 you should be all right, but ____ take an umbrella just in case
 
 
*
 
 Th e conjunction as /z/ is weakened to /əz/ when unstressed:
 
7.25 they were as /əz/ snug as ____ a bug in a rug
 
 
as ____ warm as ____ toast
 
 
as ____ dry as ____ possible
 
 Th e /z/ is susceptible to the process of assimilation:
 
 take as ____ much as ____ you like
 
 If you in this context is unstressed, the /j/ will be elided: /ə u/: but if you is 
stressed, the /j/ is retained: . . . as you think best.
 
7.26 /... ə ju/
 
 As at the beginning of an utterance is usually strong:
 
7.27 as /z/ I came to work today
 
 
*
 
 Th e conjunction because has a strong form /bikɒz/ and a weak form when 
unstressed: /bikəz/. At the beginning of an utterance, it is usually strong:
 
7.28 because /bikɒz/ it’s raining, we’ll stay inside
 
7.29 we can go out now, because /bikəz/ it’s stopped
 
 Th e weak form can be further weakened to a single syllable: /kəz/, popularly 
spelt as cos:
 
7.30 let’s go out, cos /kəz/ it’s stopped raining
 
 Th e fi nal /z/ is susceptible to the process of assimilation:
 
7.31 we’re going out, cos /kə/ you said we could
 
 (Th e /j/ of you would be elided if unstressed.)
 
 Th e weak forms of because are valid too in the phrasal preposition because
of.
 
7.32 we stayed in because /bikəz/ of /əv/ the rain
 
 we stayed in cos /kəz/ of /əv/ the rain
 
 
*
 
 Th e word that is usually pronounced in a weak form /ðət/ when it operates as 
a relative pronoun or conjunction, as in
 
7.33 the weather that /ðət/ was forecast
 
 they said that _____ it would be wet
 
 now that _____ it’s stopped . . .

111
CHAPTER 7
Rhythm
 
 Th e word that is usually pronounced in its strong form /ðt/ as a  demonstrative 
adjective or pronoun:
 
7.34 it rained throughout that /ðt/ day
 
 so that /ðt / was that /ðt/
 
 it was that /ðt/ wet
 
 Transcribe
 
7.35 that ______ man said that _____ all that _____ rain that _____ fell yesterday
 
 was enough to fi ll that _____ reservoir that _____ we saw.

 Finally, the conjunction than has a strong form /ðn/, but is usually 
 pronounced in its weak form /ðən/:
 
7.36 wetter than /ðən/ yesterday
 
 more rain than _____ ever
 
 rather go abroad than _____ stay here
 
 
*
 
 None of the other conjunctions have special weak forms with a change of 
vowel; they are transcribed with a stress mark if they are stressed, and without 
it if unstressed:
 
7.37 I said if /if/
 
 if /if/ you like
 
7.38 while /wail/ it’s raining let’s play Monopoly
 
 let’s play Monopoly while /wail/ it’s raining
 
 
*
 
Determiners
 
 Th e determiners that have special weak forms are the defi nite and indefi nite 
articles and the possessive adjectives.
 
 Th e defi nite article the has a special strong form: /ði/, as in
 
7.39 Spain is the /ði/ place for the sun
 
 It also has an ordinary strong form: /ðə/ as in
 
7.40 the defi nite article is the /ðə/
 
 (Th is is one of only two occasions in SESP when the neutral vowel is stressed.)
 
 Th e also has two weak forms in most accents, though the second is less common 
in General American: /ðə/ before consonants, /ði/ before vowels, as in
 
 Th e /ðə/ defi nite article
 
 Th e /ði/ articles

 Th e word some is used for indefi niteness with mass nouns like milk. Its strong 
form is /s
m/ and its weak form is /səm/.
 
7.45 at least you’ve got some /s

 I need some /səm/ more milk
 
 Transcribe these phrases with both the strong and the weak forms:
 
7.46 some sugar 
_____ , _____ ________
 
 some money 
_____ , _____ ________
 
 some change 
_____ , _____ ________

 Any and many have the same form in both stressed and unstressed situations:
 
7.47 I haven’t had any /εni/ sugar
 
 I haven’t had any /εni/ sugar
 
7.48 they’ve been many /mεni / times
 
 I do not have many /mεni / ideas
 
 But there is the possibility of weak forms in common phrases: /əni/ and /məni/ 
as in

113
CHAPTER 7

7.49 I haven’t any /əni/ left 
 
 how many /məni/ do you need

 Th e demonstrative adjectives are this /ðis/, that /ðt/, these /ðiz/ and those 
/ðəυz/. Th ey do not change in unstressed positions: it is in this respect that 
it is important to distinguish between that as a conjunction which regularly 
weakens to /ðət/ and that as a determiner that retains its strong form.
Notice how the fi nal /s/ of this, and the fi nal /z/ of these and those are sus-
ceptible to the process of assimilation:
 
7.50 what are you going to do with all those /ðəυ/ euros? and this ____ cheque?
 
 
*
 
 Th e possessive adjectives are my /mai/, your /jɔ/, his /hiz/, her /h/, its /its/, 
our /aυə/, their /ðεə/ and whose /huz/. Strong forms are used for emphasis or 
contrast.
My and their do not normally have a weak form:
 
7.51 hey, that’s my /mai/ sun cream, my _____ towel, my _____ place
 
7.52 now, let me think. I’ve got my /mai/ wallet, my _____ passport, my _____ 
ticket  _________________ and my _____ insurance.
 
 Our is oft en weakened to /ɑ/ (look back at p. 71), and with /r/ liaison:
 
7.53 we’re off  on our /ɑ/ holidays on our /ɑr/ old bikes
 
 Your is oft en weakened to /jə/, with /r/ liaison – hence its popular spelling as 
yer:
 
7.54 off  on your /jə/ holidays?
 
 on your /jə/ bike? on your /jər/ own?
 
 His, her and whose have weak forms with /h/ elision if immediately preceded 
by a word:
 
7.55 what’s his /iz/ name? I don’t know his /iz/ name
 
 what’s her // name? I don’t know her // name
 
 the couple whose /uz/ names I’ve forgotten
 
 If they begin a new utterance, the /h/ is usually pronounced.

7.58 St /sənt/ Andrew
 
 Sir /sə/ Winston 
Sir /sər/ Anthony

Pronouns
 
 Th e subject pronouns are I /ai/, you /ju /, he /hi/, she /ʃi/, it /it/, we /wi/ and 
they /ðei/; the object pronouns, where diff erent, are me /mi/, him /him/, her 
/h/, us /
s/ and them /ðεm/. Th e relative pronouns are who /hu/, and, possi-
bly, whom /hum/; and the possessive pronouns are mine /main/, yours /jɔz/, 
his /hiz/, hers /hz/, ours /aυəz/ (or /ɑz/), theirs /ðεəz/ and whose /huz/. 
Th ese strong forms are used for emphasis or contrast; there are weak forms for 
many of them in unstressed positions. However, the possessive  pronouns are 
not normally used in unstressed positions.
 
 Th e weak forms of he, she, we, me all take a weak vowel:
 
7.59 he /hi/ told me /mi/, so we /wi/ know she /ʃi/ is going to Spain
 
 Th e weak forms of us and them take the neutral vowel
 
7.60 they told us /əs/ that you saw them /ðəm/ on their way
 
 A special case arises with let’s /lεts/ as distinct from let us /lεt əs/. Compare
 
7.61 let’s go, let us go
 
 Th e weak forms of he, him, her and who tend to allow /h/ elision unless they 
begin a new utterance, like his, her, whose (see p. 113).
 
7.62 he /hi/ has heard, but does he /i/ understand?

 Th e /j/ is susceptible to coalescence immediately aft er /t, d/:

 we’ll need you /nid ə/ there
 
 did you /did ə/ go
 
 must you /m

 Finally, there is the pronoun one
 
7.65 /w
n, wɒn/
 
 In an unstressed position, it generally keeps its strong form:
 
 One /w
n, wɒn/ must not lose one’s /w
nz, wɒnz/ head, must one /w
n, 
wɒn/
 
 I’d like one /w
n, wɒn/ of the red ones /w
nz, wɒnz/
 
 Th ere is a weak form that is occasionally used: /ən/, popularly spelled as ’un
 
7.66 the little uns /ənz/

Auxiliary verbs
 
 Th e auxiliary verbs be, have and do and their various forms are used in verb 
phrases to indicate aspect, emphasis and contrast, and to operate negative 
and interrogative functions. Th ere are strong forms and weak forms for each 
verb. Each of these verbs also acts as a full, lexical verb, in which case, they will 
 normally be pronounced in their strong forms, e.g.
 
7.67 To be /bi/ or not to be /bi/
 
 To have /hv/ and to hold
 
 To do /du/ or die
 
 As auxiliary verbs, they are stressed for emphasis or contrast, but are unstressed 
otherwise:
 
7.68 To see and be /bi/ seen 
You won’t be /bi/ seen
 
7.69 To fi ght and to have /hv/ fought 
You must have /əv/ fought
 
7.70 Do /du/ take a seat 
Where do /du/ I sit?

 Be
 
7.71 I am /m/ going
 
 Am is weakened to /əm/ aft er a consonant, e.g.
 
7.72 where am /əm/ I staying?
 
 and to /m/ aft er a vowel, e.g.
 
7.73 I’m /m/ staying here
 
7.74 you are /ɑ/ going
 
 with /r/ liaison:
 
 you are /ɑr/ invited
 
 Are is weakened to /ə/, e.g.
 
7.75 all the boys are /ə/ going
 
 with /r/ liaison, e.g.
 
 all the boys are /ər/ invited
 
 Are may be weakened to /r/ following a vowel:
 
7.76 you’re invited /jɔ r, jə r/
 
 they’re invited /ðei r, ðεə r/
 
7.77 he is /iz/ going
 
 Is is weakened in a way parallel to the morphological variations of the <-es> 
infl ection (look back at pp. 53–54)
 
7.78 James is /iz/ going, and Janice is /iz/ too  (/iz, əz/ aft er sibilants)
 
 John’s /z/ going, and Claire’s /z/ thinking about it  (/z/ aft er other voiced 
sounds)
 
 Jack’s /s/ going, but Elizabeth’s /s/ not  (/s/ aft er voiceless sounds)
 
7.79 he was /wɒz/ going
 
 Was is weakened to /wəz/:
 
7.80 Sarah was /wəz/ going too, and so was /wə/ Judith
 
7.81 they were /w/ going
 
 Were is weakened to /wə/, with possible /r/ liaison:
 
7.82 none of them were /wə/ going, even though they were /wər/ all invited
 
7.83 I’ve been /bin/ invited already
 
 Been is weakened to /bin/:

 Have
 
7.85 I have /hv/ seen it
 
 she has /hz/ seen it
 
 they had /hd/ seen it
 
 Have, has, had ‘suff er’ /h/ elision in their weak forms unless they begin new 
utterances:
 
7.86 have /həv/ you seen it
 
 has /həz / he seen it
 
 had /həd/ they seen it
 
 Otherwise the weak forms retain the neutral vowel aft er a consonant, but lose 
it aft er a vowel:
 
7.87 yes, I ve /v/ seen it, and the boys ve /əv/ seen it too
 
 yes, he s /z/ seen it, and Janice s /əz/ seen it too
 
 yes, they d /d/ seen it, and the girls d /əd/ seen it too
 
 Has also follows the morphological variations of the <-es> infl ection, like is:

 John s gone /z/
 
 Jack s gone /s/

 Do
 
7.89 I do /du/ believe in God
 
 Do is weakened to /du/ or /də/:
 
7.90 do /du, də/ they believe in God
 
 do /du, də/ you believe too
 
7.91 she does /d
z/ believe in God
 
 Does is weakened to /dəz/:
 
7.92 does /dəz/ he believe too
 
 Note that in do you /də ju/, the neutral vowel is oft en elided, allowing a process 
of coalescent assimilation to take place: /dju/ becomes /du/ (or /də/).
 
7.93 how do you do? /haυ də du/
 
 what do you think? /wɒt də θiŋk/

Modal verbs
 
 Modal verbs add degrees of a sense of likelihood, necessity and possibility to 
the verb phrase. Th ey include

 can /kn/ and could /kυd/
 
 may /mei/ and might /mait/
 
 shall /ʃl/ and should /ʃυd/
 
 will /wil/ and would /wυd/
 
 must /m
st/ and ought /ɔt/
 
 Th ey are pronounced in these full forms when stressed, especially for emphasis 
or contrast:
 
7.94 can /kn/ you speak Spanish? I can /kn/ and I will /wil/
 
 but what about Catalan? I would /wυd/ if I could /kυd/
 
 May, might and ought do not have special weak forms when unstressed, but the 
other modal verbs do.
 
7.95 she can /kən/ speak Spanish quite well
 
 she could /kəd/ have said that in Spanish for you
 
 we shall /ʃəl/ see if she can /kn/
 
 they should /ʃəd/ tell her to come
 
 how will /wəl/ they know you’re going
 
 we would /wəd/ have to tell them
 
 she must /məst/ at least be given a chance
 
 yes, she must /məs/ be given the chance at least
 
 Will and shall are both regularly reduced to /l/ or /əl/; and would and should to 
/d/ or /əd/; thus the semantic diff erences between them are lost.
 
7.96 we’ll /l/ see you tonight
 
 if she’d /d/ talk in Spanish, that’d /əd/ help us a lot
 
 otherwise Paul’ll /əl/ try
 
 Final /d/ of could, should, would and had, like did, is susceptible to the  processes 
of assimilation.
 
7.97 they could /kυ/ go, if they could /kəb/ manage without her
 
 they should /ʃυb/ be able to manage
 
 they would /wυb/ be able to manage if she went with them
 
 she’d // go with them, but would you /wυd u/ let her

 how would you /wəd ə/ feel about that
 
 
*
 
Just, not, so, there
 
 Th e fi rst three of these words fi gure regularly in all kinds of phrases and idioms, 
and no doubt it is because of their frequency that they have acquired weak 
forms, in addition to their strong forms
 
7.98 they’ve just /d

 not /nɒt/ bad, but they’ll be so /səυ/ tired

 Th ere has a special weak form in existential clauses, in contrast to locative 
senses:
 
7.100 it was nice being there /ðεə/, but there’s /ðə z/ no place like home
 
 Th ere is a further complication in the pronunciation of n’t. We have 
already  noted that fi nal /t/ is now oft en articulated as a glottal stop [ʔ] 
before any immediately following consonant (except /h/). Th is would account 
for
 
7.101 I don’t know /ai dəυnt[ʔ] nəυ/
 
 Th e [ʔ] would, however, not prevent the processes of assimilation operating in 
informal colloquial speech, so these alternatives exist:
 
7.102 I don’t believe it 
/ai dəυnt[ʔ] bəliv it/ or /ai dəυmp bəliv it/
 
 I don’t get it 
/ai dəυnt[ʔ] εt it/ or /ai dəυŋk εt it/
 
 why don’t you 
/wai dəυnt[ʔ] ju/ or /wai dəυntʃ u/

120
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 If this wasn’t complicated enough, it is also observable how people are simpli-
fying some of these phrases even further. If the n’t follows a vowel, the /n/ can 
change to a nasalization of that vowel and the /t/ to a glottal stop.
 
7.103 I don’t [də˜υ˜ʔ] know
 
 I can’t [kɑ˜ʔ] believe it
 
 they aren’t [ɑ˜ʔ] going
 
 we weren’t [w˜ʔ] coming
 
 we shan’t [ʃɑ˜ʔ] go
 
 you won’t [wə˜υ˜ʔ] make it
 
 she daren’t [dε˜ə˜ʔ] move
 
 Finally, to add yet further to these complications, people very oft en simplify 
in another way by eliding the /t/ of n’t, even though it is preceded by a voiced 
sound /n/:
 
7.104 I don’t know 
/ai dəυn nəυ/ or even /ai də nəυ/ (= I ‘dunno’)
 
 I don’t care 
/ai dəυŋ kεə/
 
 we won’t bother /wi wəυm bɒðə/
 
 you didn’t say 
/ju didn sei/
 
 etc.
 
 A similar process of elision explains how want to and going to get pronounced:
 
7.105 I want to go (I ‘wanna’ go) 
/ai wɒnə əυ/
 
 I’m going to go (I’m gonna go) 
/aim ɒnə əυ/
 
 To summarize this complex range of possibilities, cases of n’t immediately 
aft er a vowel (as in aren’t, weren’t, don’t, can’t, won’t, shan’t, daren’t) can be 
 pronounced as follows:
 
 Don’t talk:  
/dəυnt[th]/, /dəυnt[ʔ]/, [də˜υ˜ʔ], /dəυn/
 
 Don’t push 
/dəυnt[th]/, /dəυmp/, [də˜υ˜ʔ], /dəυm/
 
 Don’t go  
/dəυnt[th]/, /dəυŋk/, [də˜υ˜ʔ], /dəυŋ/
 
 Most of these possibilities are also valid for other words ending in /-nt/: 
however, the /t/ element is usually retained whether it is realized as [t] or [ʔ] 
or assimilated:
 
 pleasantness 
/plεzənt[ʔ]nəs/
 
 resentment 
/rizεnt[ʔ]mənt, rizεmpmənt/
 
 pleasant places 
/plεznt[ʔ], plεzəmp pleiʃəz/
 
 recent case  
/risnt[ʔ], risəŋk keisəz/
 
 front page 
/fr
nt[ʔ], fr
mp/ ~ [fr
˜ʔ] /peid/
 
 front cover 
/fr
nt[ʔ], fr
ŋk/ ~ [fr
˜ʔ] /k
və/
 
 In all these cases of n’t and fi nal -nt, you have to listen carefully to what is actually 
said; and being aware of the various possibilities will help to discern that. In such 
cases, it seems worth while transcribing a glottal stop as such, [ʔ], even though, 
strictly speaking, it does not belong to broad (phonemic) transcriptions.

CHAPTER 7
Rhythm
 
Syllable elision in lexical items and phrases
 
 Th e pressure from rhythm accounts not only for the proliferation of special 
weak forms of many grammatical items but also for the elimination of whole 
syllables, especially in verb phrases with auxiliary and modal verbs. Th us in
 
 I don’t know if he’s coming
 
 the two syllables of do not are reduced to one, don’t, and also the two syllables 
of he is to one, he’s.
Th ere has been a similar strong tendency to eliminate syllables in lexical 
items too, specially where there is a succession of unstressed syllables separated 
by /r, l, n /. Typically, the unstressed vowel is elided before such a consonant; in 
this way the syllable sequence is reduced. Th us historically, history has changed 
from /histəri/ to /histri/ in most – but not all – British accents, and secretary 
from /sεkrətəri/, or /sεkrətεəri/, to /sεkrətri/. Here is a sample list of ordi-
nary words with unstressed <-ar->, <-er->, <-or->, <-our-> and <-ur-> which 
gets eliminated before another unstressed syllable.

 Notice how the four syllables of February /fεbruəri/ get reduced to three:

7.110 February
 
 Similarly, library, literary, temporary are sometimes reduced with the loss of 
one /r/:
 
7.111 /laibri/, /litri/, /tεmpri/.
 
 Th ere is, however, usually no reduction in those words where otherwise /l/ and 
/r/ would come together:

7.112 salary /sləri/; celery /sεləri/; calorie /kləri/; colouring /k

 not */slri/, etc.
 
 American practice is to give a secondary stress to the <a> in words like primary, 
secondary; and primary stress in derived adverbs; many British follow this 
pattern in the adverbs: thus primarily is either
 
7.113 /praimrəli/ or /praimεrəli/ or /praimεərəli/ or /praimrəli/.
 
 Listen and transcribe theses words
 
7.114 secondarily, temporarily

rated by /l/. Th us, older historically /histɒrikəli/ loses the syllable before /l/:

 Th e words chocolate and family are both regularly reduced to two syllables: 
/tʃɒklət/; /fmli/, and verbs with an unstressed syllable with /l/ in fi nal posi-
tion, followed by the –ing suffi  x: travelling /trvəliŋ/ becomes /tr
liŋ/. 
(Look back at p. 39 for similar cases with syllabic /l/.)
Notice also how the three syllables of national and company /nʃənəl/, 
/k
mpəni/ become two /nʃnəl/, /k
mpni/ and how the four syllables of 
reasonable /rizənəbəl/ become three /riznəbəl/, through the loss of the 
unstressed syllable before /n/. (In a similar way the four syllables of comfort-
able /k
mfətəbəl/ become three /k
mftəbəl/.)

123
CHAPTER 7
Rhythm
Th e elimination of a weak syllable in a sequence of weak syllables also takes 
place across word boundaries, i.e. in phrases. Consider the phrase matter of fact 
/mtər ə
 fkt/; there is a sequence of two unstressed syllables separated by 
/r/ in a way that is exactly parallel in the case of lexical items like mystery and 
interest. What regularly happens is that the unstressed syllable before /r/ will 
disappear: /mtr ə
 fkt/. Consider these phrases and transcribe them in 
the same colloquial style

 Finally, it is worth noting that some speakers eliminate an unstressed vowel at 
the beginning of certain words before /r, l/, as in correct /kərεkt/ becoming 
/krεkt/ and collect /kəlεkt/ becoming /klεkt/. Consider these words and 
transcribe them in this colloquial style

 Notice how perhaps /pəhps/ alternates with /pərps/ and then also, 
more colloquially, with /prps/. And the verb suppose /səpəυz/ is reduced 
to /spəυz/, especially in the phrase suppose so; a popular spelling, s’pose so, 
refl ects this.
Similarly, in phrases with unstressed for and /r/ liaison, the neutral vowel 
before /r/ may disappear; for example, for instance may reduce to two syllables 
/fr instənts/ from the three of /fər instənts/. Transcribe in this same col-

8 Intonation: tonality
 
Introduction
 
 Spoken discourse not only uses rhythm as a resource, but intonation too. What 
is intonation? Intonation is the linguistic use of pitch in discourse. It is linguis-
tic, in the sense that it carries meaning; changing the intonation of an utterance 
can easily change the meaning of that utterance. For instance, the clause
• you understand, don’t you
 
 has one meaning if the tag is accompanied by a falling tone, but a diff erent 
meaning if it is accompanied by a rising tone. (Say it to yourself, to make sure!) 
Th e notion of linguistic can be extended to include the paralinguistic use of into-
nation, in which something of the mood or attitude of the speaker is conveyed, 
for instance whether the speaker is angry, bored, insistent, etc. Linguistic might 
also be extended to include sociolinguistic variation of the kind that shows where 
a person comes from; for instance, the intonation of working-class Bristolians 
is quite diff erent from, say, that of middle-class Glaswegians. For practical 
 purposes, in this workbook, we will have to focus on just the one variety, SESP.
Note also that we need to make the distinction between intonation and 
lexical tone in tone languages. In tone languages, a change of tone (i.e. pitch) 
may change the meaning of a word/lexical item, as in Cantonese:
 
8.1 si - 
‘silk’ 
(high level)
 
 si 0 
‘to try’ 
(mid level)
 
 si 1 
‘matter’ 
(low mid level)
 
 si 2 
‘time’ 
(low level)
 
 si  3 
‘history’ 
(mid to high rising)
 
 si  3 
‘city’ 
(low to mid rising)
 
 but in a non-tone language like English, a word like see will keep its lexical 
meaning even when accompanied by diff erent tones/pitches, but its meaning 
in discourse might change:
 
8.2 see - said insistently
 
 see 0 said in a bored manner, as if to mean I knew it would happen
 
 see 1 said in a cold manner
 
 see 2 said in a cold manner
 
 see  3 said in a challenging manner, as if to mean Do you understand now?
 
 see  3 said in an appealing manner, as if to mean I did tell you.

131
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
 
 Intonation in English is thus the linguistic use of pitch in discourse, but it com-
prises more than tone. When we talk, we usually have more to say than just one 
piece of information; sometimes it might only be one piece of information, like 
Th ank you, but usually it is much more. Each piece of information is conveyed 
by a unit of intonation; these units of intonation – called, by others, tone units, 
tone groups, intonation contours or intonation phrases – constitute the tonality 
of spoken discourse. As we will soon see, changes in tonality also eff ect changes 
in meaning.
Th irdly, each intonation unit has a word which is more prominent than the 
others; they are made more prominent by a distinctive pitch movement or level 
and loudness. Th ese words constitute the nucleus, or tonic, of the intonation 
unit and indicate the specifi c point of information, i.e. what the unit of intona-
tion focuses on. Th ese prominent, nuclear (tonic) words constitute the tonicity 
of spoken discourse; again, changes in tonicity eff ect changes in meaning.
Tonality, tonicity and tone are the basic systems that operate in English 
intonation; choices in all three systems are made every time we say something. 
We always use all three systems together, although we can vary them in order 
to create diff erent meanings. Take the example of You understand, don’t you. 
Listen to these three diff erent renderings
 
8.3 you under\stand | \don t you
 
 you under\stand | /don t you
 
 
\you understand | /don t you
 
 Th e tonality of all three renderings consists of two units of intonation; the 
upright bar ( | ) marks unit boundaries.
Th e tonicity of the fi rst two is the same, with the words understand and don’t 
the most prominent in each of their units; underlining marks out the tonic syl-
lable of each word. Th e tonicity is diff erent in the fi rst unit of intonation in the 
third rendering, where you was chosen as the prominent; this will only make 
sense if a contrast is being made with somebody else who presumably does not 
understand.
Th e tones in each unit vary between falling (\) and rising (/). In the fi rst ren-
dering, the tag don’t you is accompanied by a falling tone, which suggests that 
the speaker thinks that they know they are right; but in the other two render-
ings, the tag is accompanied by a rising tone, which suggests that the speaker is 
not sure whether they are right or not.
You will be given guidance and practice in all three systems. We begin with 
the case of tonality, because most of our spoken discourse is longer than a 
single piece of information. We need to know the tonality of the discourse 
before we can investigate the tonicity of each unit of intonation; and we need 
to know the tonicity of the unit before we can safely identify the tone that 
has been chosen. Th is ‘hierarchy’ of systems is the basis of the way these fi nal 
Chapters of the workbook are organized.
However, before we get into the programme, we need to identify the parts 
of an intonation unit, in order to show where the potential for intonational 

132
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
contrasts lies. Let us take the sentence I wish I understood it; a native speaker of 
English is most likely to say it as
 
8.4 I wish I under\stood it
 
 as one single piece of information (i.e. as one intonation unit), with focus on 
understood and a falling tone to indicate a statement. Th e structure of the unit 
consists, at one level, of two parts:
1. the part that includes the tonic syllable with its distinctive tone, and any 
syllables that follow (in this case -\stood it); this is called the tonic 
segment;
2. all the rest of the intonation unit that precedes the tonic segment (in this 
case I wish I under-); this is called the pretonic segment.
 
 Th e tonic segment is usually divided into two: the tonic syllable itself, and the 
remaining syllables, oft en called the tail. Th e pretonic segment is also usually 
divided into two: the segment that contains the fi rst stressed syllable and all 
the remaining syllables up to the tonic syllable – this segment is oft en called 
the head; any unstressed syllables preceding the head are oft en called the 
 pre-head. All four segments are illustrated in the example:
 
     pretonic segment 
| tonic segment
 
     I wish I under\stood it
 
 
pre-head | head 
| tonic | tail
 
 Th ere is the potential for contrasts not only in the tonic syllable but in the head 
and pre-head segments too; that is why we need to identify them. Th e tail does 
not usually carry contrasts, but it does carry pitch changes for the compound 
tones (see later).
Th e tonic syllable is obligatory; if a unit of intonation is begun, but no syl-
lable is made tonic, then we conclude that that intonation unit has been aban-
doned. Th is sometimes happens in informal discourse, as a speaker changes 
their mind and starts an intonation unit afresh. Th e tail, head and pre-head 
are all optional, in the sense that they may perhaps not be required in the 
 construction of an intonation unit. Consider these examples:
 
8.5 I wish I under\stood 
(no tail)
 
 
\think about it 
(no head, no pre-head)
 
 I’ll \think about it 
 (pre-head, but no head, since the fi rst stressed syllable 
happens to be the tonic syllable)
 
 
\think 
(tonic syllable only; no head, no pre-head, no tail)
 
Symbols
 
 Th e symbols used in this workbook are, in general, consistent with Crystal 
(1969, 1975), Tench (1996) and Wells (2006); see the panel below for the minor 
diff erences with Wells. Th ese symbols are simple and economic to use; their 
design is relatively iconic, and are as follows:

133
CHAPTER 8

PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 Other authors use diff erent symbols. Pike (1945), for instance and those in his 
Tagmemic tradition used a set of numbers to indicate pitch heights. Halliday 
(1967, 1970; see also Halliday & Greaves 2008) use a set of numbers to indi-
cate whole ‘tunes’; Brazil (1975; 1997) and those in his Birmingham Discourse 
Intonation tradition use letters to indicate ‘tunes’, but both are relatively easily 
converted to the above; see the panel below. Pierrehumbert (1987), Ladd 
(1996), Beckman & Elam (1997), Gussenhoven (2004) and others use the Tone 
and Break Index, ‘ToBI’, and a set of letters and symbols to indicate pitch height 
and movement. It is diffi  cult to ‘translate’ these ToBI formulae, because there 
does not seem to be an equivalent theory of information structure or a clear 
designation of tonicity; furthermore, there are diff erences between these four 
authors, but an attempt is made in the panel below to compare Gussenhoven’s 
system with that introduced here. Th e ToBI approach is used widely in North 
America. (Gaps in the panel indicate that a particular feature is not recognized 
in that particular system.)
 
Tonality
 
 Tonality is the division of spoken discourse into discrete units of intonation, 
each of which carries one piece of information. Th is function can easily be 
demonstrated by listening to one sentence spoken with diff erent tonality:
 
8.6 
i they’re coming on \Monday
 
 ii they’re \coming | on \Monday
 
 Th e fi rst rendering presents just one piece of information, whereas in the 
second, the speaker fi rst tells one thing (‘they’re coming’) and then adds a 
second piece of information (i.e. when they are coming). Th ere is thus a con-
trast in tonality, and that contrast signals a diff erent distribution of informa-
tion. Tonality thus represents the way the speaker perceives all the information 
and then organizes it into units of intonation.
As oft en as not, tonality boundaries coincide with clause boundaries; and 
there is good reason for this. A clause is designed to convey reference to a 
situation or happening, with a verb indicating the activity or state of aff airs, 
and nouns (and nominal groups) representing the participants; adverbs and 
prepositional phrases represent reference to any circumstances; conjunctions 
represent links between the situations or happenings. A clause, in essence, is 
the grammatical means of representing pieces of information – an activity or 
state of aff airs, participants, circumstances and linkage. And an intonation 
unit, in essence, is the phonological means of representing pieces of informa-
tion in spoken discourse. In this way, there is a neat congruence of phonology, 
grammar and semantics (the ‘pieces of information’); when this congruence 
is actually realized in spoken language, we speak of neutral tonality: a single 
unit of intonation representing a single piece of information worded as a single 
clause. Th is was the case, for instance, in i above.
Neutral tonality accounts for at least half of the instances of intonation units 

135
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
in informal conversation. Listen to the following account of a dangerous child-
hood prank: listen for the intonation units and mark them with the upright 
bar ( | ), and then notice how oft en – but not always! – the tonality boundaries 
coincide with clause boundaries. Listen as oft en as you need; concentrate on 
lines 5 to 17, since the speaker is still sorting out the story in his mind in the 
earlier lines, 1 to 4.

You will, perhaps fi rst of all, notice that the pauses do not always coincide 
with either clause boundaries or intonation unit boundaries; the reason is 
clear: pauses oft en indicate hesitation by the speaker in the process of compos-
ing their discourse. In line 5, for instance, the brief pause before ammunition 
seems to indicate the speaker’s hesitation as he sought the right word, and not 
the division between one piece of information knew his dad had some and a 
second piece ammunition. But the pause aft er ammunition does seem to indi-
cate the end of one piece of information and the beginning of a second piece 
(i.e. the source of the ammunition). Th e pause aft er war seems to conclude the 
whole clause knew his dad had some ammunition from the war and to prepare 
for the next piece of information and he found it. But there does not seem to 
be a pause between that piece of information and the next, and they were thirty 
eight. So although pauses may oft en indicate the boundary of intonation units, 
they are not absolutely necessary, and in any case, oft en indicate something 
quite diff erent, hesitation.
Secondly, you will notice the movements of pitch throughout the discourse; 
for instance, there is a falling movement from a relatively high pitch on -ition 
and then on war, found it and -eight. Th ese will turn out to be tonic syllables 
because they each appear in what seem to be separate intonation units. But the 

136
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
point here is that aft er each fall there is an eventual return to a higher pitch; the 
low end of the fall signals the end of one unit, and the beginning of a change of 
pitch is one of the signals for the next unit. Similarly, aft er a rising tone, there 
will be a return to a lower pitch.
Th irdly, there is a tendency for unstressed syllables at the beginning of an 
intonation unit to be articulated more quickly than those at the end; this may, 
however, be diffi  cult to perceive or measure without instrumentation. Yet this 
change of pace also contributes to the impression that a boundary is being 
marked.
Th e clearest boundaries are marked by all three features: pausing, a change 
of pitch and a change of pace. Oft en, only two, or even only one feature is 
present. What also helps is the grammar; for example, some ammunition con-
stitutes one single nominal group, and so it would be most likely that a piece of 
information will include the whole of it. Furthermore, as we have seen, clause 
boundaries are very likely places for intonation unit boundaries because they 
will also constitute pieces of information. Help also comes from a perception 
of the pieces of information as such – that is how we, the listeners, process the 
information. We processed the information of 8.6i as one piece, but we seem 
to hear two pieces of information in 8.6ii. Altogether, there is a whole set of 
phonetic, grammatical and semantic clues.
Now let us present that same discourse (from line 5) clause by clause, to see 
to what extent that there is a matching up of clauses and intonation units:
 
  1. knew his dad had some ammunition | from the war 
5
 
  2. and he found it 
5–6
 
  3. and they were thirty eight 
6
 
  4. so we um took them over the marshes 
6–7
 
  5. and shot a couple of rounds off  
7
 
  6. and that was great 
7
 
  7.  and then one one day | we were up in Prospect Road | near the
scout hut | in a shed | in a um Rick Holmans’s shed| 
7–9
 
  8. so there was four of us | in this sort of eight by six shed 
9–10
 
  9. and we were playing about with the thing 
10–11
 
 10. and we messed about with it 
11
 
 11. and did the usu you know 
11–12
 
 12. and and sort of said ‘Oh we’ll put a cross in it 
12
 
 13. and make a dum-dum of it’ 
13
 
 14. and fi red it | in the shed | at at at the bit of wood 
13–14
 
 15. and this bullet went round the shed | about three times 
14–15
 
 16. and we all just froze 
15
 
 17. and this bullet went round | and round | and round 
15–16
 
 18. was absolutely outrageous 
16
 
 19. and we had no concept | of what we what could have happened 
17
 
 Th e matching up of clause and intonation unit – neutral tonality – is demon-
strated in clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18 – in at least twelve of the 

137
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
nineteen clauses. (In clause 11, there is only one main verb, did, because you 
know would be treated as a comment adjunct/adverbial (or discourse item); in 
clause 12, there is a reporting clause said with its complement “Oh we’ll put a 
cross in it. . ., and thus only one main clause.)
But what about the others? When a clause and an intonation unit do not 
have common boundaries, the tonality is marked. Marked tonality was dem-
onstrated in 8.6ii; usually, marked tonality is chosen when the speaker decides 
to present more than one piece of information within a single clause, as in that 
case. Occasionally, the reverse can happen when a speaker words a single unit 
of information/intonation as two clauses, for example:
 
8.8 he did I \saw him
 
 Now let us examine the cases of marked tonality in the discourse.
 
  1. knew his dad had some ammunition | from the war 
5
 
 Th e fi rst unit contains the mental process knew and its complement, an embed-
ded clause. It is potentially a ‘candidate’ for neutral tonality, but the clause has 
not yet been fi nished. Th e second unit has only a prepositional phrase – less 
than a clause; it provides additional information, like 8.6ii. Th us there is one 
main clause, but two units of information/intonation – marked tonality.
 
  7.  and then one one day | we were up in Prospect Road | near the scout 
hut | in a shed |  in a um Rick Holmans’s shed| 
7–9
 
 One clause, but fi ve units of information/intonation – marked tonality. Th e 
fi rst one is a case of marked theme; see below (p. 141). Th e other units present 
ever more detailed information about the location.
 
  8. so there was four of us | in this sort of eight by six shed 
9–10
 
 One clause, but two units of information/intonation – marked tonality. Th e 
fi rst presents existential information, the second the location.
 
 14. and fi red it | in the shed | at at at the bit of wood 
13–14
 
 One clause, but three units of information/intonation – marked tonality. Th e 
fi rst tells us what happened, the second where it happened, and the third what 
the target was. Th e fi rst unit is a potential ‘candidate’ for neutral tonality, but 
the speaker has decided to add further, separate, pieces of information in the 
form of prepositional phrases.
 
 15. and this bullet went round the shed | about three times 
14–15
 
 One clause, but two units of information/intonation – marked tonality. Th e 
fi rst tells us what happened, and the second its frequency. Again, the fi rst unit is 
a potential ‘candidate’ for neutral tonality, since there is full complementation 
of the verb, but the speaker adds extra information in the form of an adjunct.
 
 17. and this bullet went round | and round | and round 
15–16
 
 One clause, but three units of information/intonation – marked tonality. Th e 
fi rst again tells us what happened, and the second and third the direction of the 
bullet, rather like a list.

138
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 19. and we had no concept | of what we what could have happened 
17
 
 One main clause, but two units of information/intonation – marked tonality. 
Th e fi rst is a mental process, derived from conceive; the second is the com-
plement of the process. Th e speaker appears to want to emphasize both the 
lack of conception and the possibility of a catastrophe – thus two pieces of 
 information.

 Now try a similar task, but this time with a discourse that was written to be 
spoken, as the script of a play. Th ere is no ‘original’ audio recording as such, 
but simply the imagination of the playwright of how they expected it to be per-
formed. But you too will be able to imagine how the dialogue could be spoken; 
but there might well be points where there is a legitimate choice – and you 
have the right to choose as if you were directing the play! Furthermore, in this 
extract from George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion the three characters have very 
diff erent accents, but the principles of tonality will apply to all of them.
Pygmalion, Act 2
 
HIGGINS Why, this is the girl I jotted down last night. She’s no use: Ive got all the 
1
records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo; and I’m not going to waste 
2
another cylinder on it. [To the girl] Be off  with you: I don’t want you. 
3
 THE FLOWER GIRL Don’t you be so saucy. You aint heard what I come for yet. [To Mrs 
4
Pearce, who is waiting at the door for further instructions] Did you tell 
5
him I come in a taxi? 
6
 
MRS PEARCE Nonsense, girl! What do you think a gentleman like Mr Higgins cares 
7
what you came in? 
8
 THE FLOWER GIRL Oh, we are proud! He aint above giving lessons, not him: I heard him 
9
say so. Well, I aint come here to ask for any compliment; and if my 
10 
money’s not good enough I can go elsewhere. 
11
 
HIGGINS Good enough for what? 
12
 THE FLOWER GIRL Good enough for yə-oo. Now you know, dont you? I’m coming to 
13
have lessons, I am. And to pay for em tə-oo: make no mistake. 
14
 
HIGGINS (stupent) Well!!! [Recovering his breath with a gasp] What do you 
15
expect me to say to you? 
16
 THE FLOWER GIRL Well, if you was a gentleman, you might ask me to sit down, I think. 
17
Dont I tell you I’m bringing you business? 
18
 
HIGGINS Pickering: shall we ask this baggage to sit down, or shall we throw her 
19
out of the window? 
20
 THE FLOWER GIRL [running away in terror to the piano, where she turns at bay]
Ah-ah-oh-ow-ow-ow-oo! [Wounded and whimpering] I wont be called a 
21
baggage when Ive off ered to pay like a lady. 
22
 
 Th e punctuation helps signifi cantly as a guide to the tonality of this dis-
course, by indicating the boundaries of the clauses, which are usually short 

139
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
enough to contain single pieces of information and single intonation units. 
Th ere may, however, be disagreements between two ‘directors’ of the play: one 
might imagine a slower pace of delivery than the other, in which case they 
might expect a greater number of units of information/intonation. Secondly, 
one might interpret the management, or distribution, of some information 
 diff erently from the other – the ‘legitimate choices’ mentioned above.
 
 Th e discourse also illustrates a number of other features of tonality.
• Exclamations are treated as pieces of information – little chunks of 
interpersonal information; for example, Why (line 1), Nonsense (7), Oh (9), 
Well (10, 15, 17) and Ah-ah-oh-ow-ow-ow-oo! (21).
• Restrictive (or defi ning) relative clauses are qualifi ers within nominal 
groups and, as such, do not count as main clauses; they are part of the 
information of the nominal group to which they belong. Examples: I jotted 
down last night (line 1), I want (2).
• Mental and verbal processes oft en have a clause as their complement, with 
the whole structure comprising a single main clause. Examples: You aint 
heard what I come for yet (4), Did you tell him I come in a taxi? (5–6), 
What do you think a gentleman like Mr Higgins . . . (7–8), you might ask me 
to sit down (17), Don’t I tell you I’m bringing you business? (18), shall we 
ask this baggage to sit down (19). All these cases would probably be spoken 
as single units of intonation.
• Long clauses of fi ve stressed syllables or more (or even sometimes of only 
four or three) have to be broken up into manageable pieces: Ive got all the 
records I want of the Lisson Grove lingo (1–2) will probably get a break 
between want and of the Lisson Grove lingo, which is an interrupted 
qualifi cation of all the records. Such breaks will come typically at syntactic 
boundaries.
• Clauses containing both a fi nite main verb and a non-fi nite verb constitute 
single clauses and single pieces of information. Th e non-fi nite verb may be 
part of a complement, for example: I heard him say so (9–10); Ive off ered to 
pay (22).
• I’m coming to have lessons (13–14) seems to be a case of two clauses in one 
piece of information, since the fi rst clause, I’m coming, contains no new 
information, rather like the fi rst clause in 8.8 above. More on this in the 
next chapter on tonicity.
• Vocatives that occur at the beginning, or in the middle, of a clause usually 
have their own intonation unit, as a piece of interpersonal information; an 
example occurs in line 19. But vocatives that occur at the end of a clause 
may well be included within an intonation unit; an example occurs in 
line 7.
• Subject disjuncts at ends of clauses usually have their own intonation units, 
because of the signifi cance of their interpersonal information. Examples: 
He aint above giving lessons | not him (9); I’m coming to have lessons | I am 
(13–14).

140
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
• Tags usually have their own intonation units, as separate pieces of 
interpersonal information. Example: Now you know | don’t you? (13).
• Comment adjuncts at the end of clauses do not normally have their own 
intonation unit even if they superfi cially constitute a clause. Example: I 
think (17).
 
 
*
 
 Each intonation unit carries one piece of information. When an intonation-
information unit matches a single clause, tonality is said to be neutral. Th is 
typically happens when the clause is
• ‘simple’ – it has full complementation but nothing extra like adjuncts, tags, 
apposition, etc.
• ‘straightforward’ – it has its usual (‘unmarked’) structure
• ‘short’ – it has no more than fi ve stressed syllables.
 
 And in most informal conversation, each single clause is, in fact, simple, 
straight forward and short, as the above real and scripted examples of discourse 
illustrate.
Th ere are, however, some regular cases of marked tonality.
 
 ‘Marked’ distribution of information. Th e most obvious regular case 
of marked tonality is where the speaker adds to the main message some 
 information about the circumstances of a situation; for example
• his dad had some ammunition | from the war;
• we were up Prospect Road | near the scout hut | in a shed.
 
 Listen to this exchange:
 
8.9 A: 
I haven’t heard anything from Jake for a bit
 
8.10 B: 
But I saw him yesterday in the library
 
 B’s one-clause reply could be a single piece of information, spoken as a single 
intonation unit (= neutral tonality):
 
 Bi 
but I saw him yesterday in the library |
 
 but he might have said it as two pieces of information:
 
 Bii 
but I saw him yesterday | in the library |
 
 or even three:
 
 Biii but I saw him | yesterday | in the library |
 
 or even four, since a conjunction like but can have its ‘meaning’ of contrast 
highlighted:
 
 Biv but | I saw him | yesterday | in the library |

141
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
 
 Th e renderings Bii to Biv are all examples of marked tonality, since the intona-
tion unit boundaries do not coincide with the one clause. Th e speaker’s marked 
distribution of information is the most obvious type of marked tonality.
Apposition is another regular case of marked tonality. Apposition refers 
to a second reference to an item within a clause as in, for example, we were in 
a shed, in Rick Holmans’s shed, where there is a second reference to the same 
item shed. Th e phrase in Rick Holmans’s shed is said to ‘stand in apposition’ to 
in a shed. It adds an extra piece of information and as such requires its own, 
additional, unit of intonation. Consider the following examples:
 
8.11 i 
this is John | my neighbour
 
 (my neighbour in apposition to John, adding an extra piece of information)
 
 ii this is my neighbour | John
 
 (John in apposition to my neighbour, adding an extra piece of information)
 
 iii this is my neighbour | from across the road
 
 (from across the road in apposition to my neighbour – extra information)
 
 iv this is my neighbour | John | from across the road
 
 (John and from across the road both stand in apposition to my neighbour)
 
 An example occurred in Dangerous childhood pranks 1:
 
 And Benny | . Brian Beddingfi elds 
4
 
 (Brian Beddingfi elds in apposition to Benny, presumably as his real name).
Listing is a further example of regular marked tonality. Each item in a list 
constitutes an extra piece of information within a clause:
 
8.12 i 
I’d like you to meet John | Joe | and Jack
 
 ii all three are tall | dark | and handsome
 
 iii they’re all wearing smart suits | white shirts | and dark sunglasses
 
 iv they are either neighbours | or friends |
 
 Note, however, that coordinated items are not always treated as single items in 
a list: e.g. black and white could either be a list or a single item, as in black and 
white shirts; shirt and tie is oft en treated as a single item, as in matching shirt 
and tie.
 
 v they never wear black and white shirts | nor matching shirt and tie |
 
 Marked theme. When a clause element precedes the subject of a clause, the 
clause structure is ‘marked’. Th e item that precedes the subject is referred to as 
the ‘marked theme’ and is placed there for informational prominence, usually 
to orientate the information of the clause to its context. Cases of marked theme 
are regularly given their own intonation unit in recognition of their informa-
tional prominence as, for example, in then one day | we were up Prospect Road. 
Th e marked theme may be an adjunct as in this case; then one day orientates 
the coming new information to what has just been said. Marked theme may 
also be the complement of a verb:
 
8.13 i 
Joe | you wouldn’t want to meet in a dark alley

142
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 Or a connective:
 
 ii however | Jack is very friendly
 
 iii whatever your problem | Jack’ll help you
 
 iv if necessary | Jack’ll lend you a bit of money
 
 Th e marked theme may itself be a full clause like these examples from the 
Pygmalion extract:
• and if my money’s not good enough | I can go elsewhere
• if you were a gentleman | you might ask me to sit down I think
 
 or the main verb itself:
 
8.14 and go elsewhere | she did
 
 Long clauses of fi ve stressed syllables or more are regularly split into two or 
more intonation units at recognized syntactic boundaries – as we have seen in 
the two discourses examined above. Here is another example:
 
8.15 the train now arriving at platform three | is the eleven twenty fi ve | from 
Swansea to London Paddington
 
 
*
 
 Now try another piece of real discourse. Mark the intonation units with | .

16
 
 You might have noticed in Dangerous childhood pranks 2 at least a couple of 
cases where the speaker seems to start a piece of information but then decides 
to restart in a diff erent way. In line 2, he hesitates aft er a little kid and starts 
the next piece of information with before, but abandons that beginning and 
starts again with the sea front. Th ese hesitations, false starts and abandoned 

143
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
 intonation units are all typical of real, unprepared, spoken discourse; but we 
still need to mark the beginning and end of each unit. An abandoned intona-
tion unit will be identifi ed as one without a tonic syllable, and this will become 
apparent in the next chapter, on tonicity. Another example of a re-start occurs 
in line 12: he’s you know; the speaker then decides to proceed as before. You 
will also fi nd a couple of similar cases at the beginning of Dangerous childhood 
pranks 1, but you are not likely to fi nd such cases in the Pygmalion extract 
where the discourse is carefully worked out and then rehearsed by actors.
Th e speaker appears to ‘stumble’ intonationally in a couple of cases, which 
is, of course, typical also of real, unprepared, spoken discourse – in the same 
way as people hesitate over the selection of words, etc. In line 10, he seems to 
add in as a separate intonation unit aft er it’s about an eight or ten foot dive. 
(With rehearsal, he would no doubt have done so.) He also seems to run but of 
course, which is in marked theme position, in line 15, into the rest of the clause, 
possibly because of the fast pace of delivery. If it was the script of a play, you 
might have directed him to slow down and treat this case of marked theme in 
the normal way, i.e. with its own intonation unit.
 
Tonality and grammatical contrasts
 
 Th ere are a number of cases where a change in tonality will signal a diff erence 
in grammar. Here is a simple example:
 
8.17 
i this is my neighbour | John
 
 ii this is my neighbour John
 
 As we have seen, i above will most likely be interpreted as a case of apposition, 
where John will be interpreted as a second reference to my neighbour. In ii 
John will probably be interpreted as a vocative; John is the person the speaker 
is actually addressing. In the written language, the two possibilities may well 
appear in identical form:
• Th is is my neighbour, John.
 
 In this case, tonality has disambiguated an identical written form with the 
potential of two distinct clause structures.
 
 Restrictive (defi ning) and non-restrictive (non-defi ning) relative clauses. A 
restrictive relative clause ‘restricts’ or ‘defi nes’ the reference to the particular 
case, as in this is the girl I jotted down last night; the relative clause, I jotted 
down last night, restricts the reference of the girl, in other words, defi nes which 
girl the speaker is referring to. But a non-restrictive or non-defi ning relative 
cause simply adds extra information which the speaker deems to be relevant 
to the discourse – hence also the term that is sometimes used, ‘adding clause’. 
Here is an example of the two possibilities:
 
8.18 
i the girl he jotted down last night | has come back
 
 ii the girl | who comes from Lisson Grove | has come back

144
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 Th e fi rst, i, has a relative clause which defi nes which girl is being referred to 
(restrictive, defi ning); the second, ii, has a relative clause that is not meant to 
defi ne, but to add relevant information (non-restrictive, non-defi ning), and 
because it is a clause that adds extra information, it is spoken as a separate 
unit of intonation. Now, of course, it would be perfectly possible to have two 
identically worded sentences with relative clauses that are either restrictive or 
non-restrictive, but it would be the tonality that, again, disambiguates the two 
grammatical categories:
 
 iii the girl who comes from Lisson Grove | has come back
 
 Which girl? Th e one from Lisson Grove, not the one from somewhere else! 
Now, compare these two instances:
 
8.19 
i my brother who lives in Africa | is an economist
 
 ii my sister | who lives in Weston | is a care worker
 
 How many brothers, and how many sisters does the speaker have? Th e tonal-
ity of the fi rst, i, suggests a restrictive relative clause; so this suggests that the 
speaker has more than one brother and needs to defi ne which one is being 
referred to. Th e tonality of ii suggests a non-restrictive relative clause; so this 
suggests only one sister, who is described further by where she lives. Again, 
compare these two possibilities:
 
8.20 
i the girl who came in a taxi | wants some lessons
 
 (‘Which girl?’ ‘Th e one who came in a taxi – not any other girl!’)
 
 ii the girl | who came in a taxi | wants some lessons
 
 (We know already which girl. Th e extra information that she came in a taxi 
tells us something relevant – that she can probably aff ord the lessons!)
 
 Th is diff erence can also be maintained in instances with less than a full relative 
clause. Compare:
 
8.21 
i the girl wearing a hat with three ostrich feathers | came in
 
 ii the girl | wearing a hat with three ostrich feathers | came in
 
 and
 
8.22 
i the man with sunglasses | is Joe
 
 ii the man | with sunglasses | is Joe
 
 A similar distinction can also be made in cases of apposition. Below, i defi nes 
which Tom Jones is being referred to, whereas ii does not:
 
8.23 
i Tom Jones the singer | comes from the Valleys
 
 ii Tom Jones | the singer | comes from the Valleys
In Dangerous childhood pranks 1, speaker A refers to his cousin Mervyn, 
identifying which of his cousins he means. With a tonality boundary between 
cousin and Mervyn, it would be understood that he only had one cousin, who 
he then decided to name.

145
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
Compare:
 
8.24 
i my cousin Mervyn | got me a gun |
 
 ii my cousin | Mervyn | got me a gun |
 
 Notice he has only one cousin Mervyn, but he decides to add some relevant 
information through a non-restrictive (non-defi ning) relative clause, that was 
in the REME, which is spoken as a separate intonation unit.
In Dangerous childhood pranks 2, speaker A begins with a restrictive rela-
tive clause, that we used to do, which is contained within the intonation unit 
that begins the other thing; and then he proceeds with a non-restrictive rela-
tive clause, that Bernard mentioned, which adds further, relevant, information 
which is accorded its own intonation unit. Also: that always got taken (line13), 
a restrictive relative clause that is contained within an intonation unit and 
defi nes which kind of lad that the boy was.
 
 Apposition and complements. Some verbs can require more than one com-
plement. Th is sets up the possibility of a sequence of nominal groups that can 
be interpreted as either a sequence of complements or a single complement 
and a case of apposition. Listen to these identically worded clauses:
 
8.25 
i she considered Mr Higgins a gentleman | (‘assessed as a gentleman’; a 
 gentleman is a second complement)
 
 ii she considered Mr Higgins | a gentleman | (‘gave due thought to him, 
 especially in view of his status’; a gentleman is in apposition to Mr Higgins)
 
 and
 
8.26  i the girl called Mr Higgins a teacher (a teacher is a second complement; that 
is what she said of him)

him, presumably because he was a teacher)
 
 Complements, and intransitive verbs. Some verbs, like wash, can function 
either transitively (i.e. with complements) or intransitively (i.e. without a com-
plement): she washed her hair; she washed (i.e. herself). Now compare these 
pairs:
 
8.27 
i she washed and brushed her hair | (i.e. she washed her hair and brushed it – 
one event; wash is transitive; her hair is complement to both verbs)
 
 ii she washed | and brushed her hair | (i.e. she washed herself and then brushed 
her hair – two events; wash is intransitive; her hair is complement only to 
brush)
 
 and
 
8.28 
i she dressed and fed the baby | (dressed is transitive; the baby is complement 
to both verbs)
 
 ii she dressed | and fed the baby | (dressed is intransitive; the baby is  complement 
only to fed)

 also
 
8.29 
i she looked and felt uncertain | (uncertain is complement to both verbs)
 
 ii she looked | and felt uncertain | (look = ‘glanced around’ – intransitive; 
uncertain is complement only to felt)
 
 and
 
8.30 
i he forgot the visitor | (forgot is transitive; the visitor is complement)
 
 ii he forgot | the visitor | (forgot is intransitive; the visitor a gloss on the subject, 
‘subject disjunct’)
 
 and
 
8.31 
i he’s trying to help the professor | (e.g. Pickering is helping Higgins)
 
 ii he’s trying to help | the professor | (e.g. Higgins is trying to help)
 
 Manner and sentence adverbs. Some adverbs, e.g. honestly, may function some-
times as an adverb of manner and sometimes as a comment on the message:
 
8.32 
i he spoke to her honestly | (honestly = manner)
 
 ii he spoke to her | honestly | (honestly = ‘I’m being honest when I tell you that 
he did speak to her, even though you may doubt it!’)
 
 and
 
8.33 
i he doesn’t talk to fl ower girls normally | (normally = ‘in a normal manner’)
 
 ii he doesn’t talk to fl ower girls | normally | (normally = ‘it is not normal for 
him to talk to fl ower girls’)
 
 also
 
8.34 
i she sings happily to herself | (happily = manner)
 
 ii she sings | happily | to herself | (happily = ‘I am happy to say’)
 
 Th e comment is treated as a separate piece of interpersonal information.
 
 Negative domain. Tonality plays a dramatic eff ect in cases where the domain 
of negation may be ambiguous. Th e following written form may have two quite 
opposite meanings:
• He didn’t agree because of the money.
 
 Either the person refused because the money was not right; or he did agree, but 
it was not on account of the money. Listen to the two possibilities in spoken 
form:
 
8.35 
i he didn’t agree | because of the money |
 
 ii he didn’t agree because of the money |
 
 In the fi rst case, n’t negates agree; in the second, n’t negates because of the 
money (i.e. ‘it was not because of the money that he agreed, but it was because 
of the challenge’). Th e domain of the negative is tied to the information within 

147
CHAPTER 8
Intonation: tonality
the intonation unit. Notice that in i above, the person did not agree, but in ii he 
did agree! (Examples like 8.35ii are very likely to have a falling-rising tone to 
indicate a point of contrast.)
 
8.36 
i I didn’t go | so that I could get promotion | (i.e. ‘I got promotion by staying’)
 
 ii I didn’t go so that I could get promotion | (i.e. ‘I did go, but not with the 
intention of getting promotion’; with a falling-rising tone)
 
 also
 
8.37 
i he won’t take notes | like last night | (i.e. ‘he didn’t take notes last night, and 
he won’t now!’)
 
 ii he won’t take notes like last night | (i.e. ‘he took notes last night, but he won’t 
do it in the same way now’; with a falling-rising tone)
 
 Complex verbal groups and clauses of purpose. Sometimes a complex verbal 
group contains a second verb in the infi nitive form, e.g. come to hear means 
‘happen, by chance, to hear’; and clauses of purpose oft en begin with the infi ni-
tive form of the verb, meaning ‘in order to’. Consider the following pair: the 
fi rst, i below, contains the complex verbal group and is therefore, basically, 
a single main clause, whereas ii below contains a clause of purpose as expla-
nation of why she came. Th e written form might be identical, but intonation 
 disambiguates conforming, in fact, to neutral tonality.
 
8.38 
i she came to hear about the lessons |
 
 ii she came | to hear about the lessons |
 
 Similarly, leave someone to do something has the same potential ambiguity. 
Consider this next pair:
 
8.39 
i she left  him to think about it |
 
 ii she left  him | to think about it |
 
 Th e fi rst, i, has leave someone to do something as a complex group, meaning 
‘Higgins had to think about it’; the second, ii, has a clause of purpose, as an 
explanation why she left  him, so that she could think about it!
A similar contrast can occur with reporting verbs with a complement that 
takes the form of an infi nitive verb. Consider:
 
8.40 
i tell him to settle the issue |
 
 ii tell him | to settle the issue |
 
 Th e fi rst, i, has a report structure, with to settle the issue as the ‘reported’ com-
plement: ‘You must tell him that he must settle the issue.’ Th e second, ii, has 
a clause of purpose: ‘If you tell him rather than keep silent, that will settle the 
issue.’ Also:
 
8.41 
i shall we ask this baggage to save us the trouble | (‘Please save us the trouble’)
 
 ii shall we ask this baggage | to save us the trouble | (‘Shall we ask? She might 
go, and that would save us the trouble of throwing her out.’)

 Further information on tonality will be found in Halliday (1967, 1970), Tench 
(1996a, 1996b), Brazil (1997) and Wells (2006). Further exercises on tonality 
will be found in Beer (2005), Bradford (1988), Brazil (1994), Gilbert (1993: 
‘thought groups’), Hancock (2003) and Hewings (2004).

9 Intonation: tonicity
 
 Tonicity is the location of the most prominent syllable in an intonation unit. 
Tonality represents the speaker’s division of the total message into separate 
pieces of information; tonicity, on the other hand, identifi es the focus of each 
piece of information. Th is function can easily be demonstrated by listening to 
one sentence spoken with diff erent tonicity:
 
9.1 
i they’re coming on \Monday |
 
 ii they’re \coming on Monday |
 
 Th e fi rst rendering focuses on Monday, whereas the second focuses on them 
coming. Th e second one can only make sense if some mention of the people’s 
movements on Monday has already been mentioned or is already known, 
and now some contrast or correction is intended, e.g. they are not leaving 
on Monday! Tonicity tells you what the focus of the information is, whereas 
 tonality tells you what the pieces of information are.
Each piece of information – each intonation unit – will have one focus, one 
tonic syllable. Occasionally, a speaker will begin an intonation unit but decide 
to abandon it before starting their information afresh; in such cases, there 
might be no tonic syllable and so we call such interrupted units ‘abandoned’ 
units: the full information was not given and the choices of focus and tone were 
not made either. Some examples were noticed in Dangerous childhood pranks 
2. Normally, however, each intonation unit will contain one tonic syllable; and 
the presence of the tonic syllable is obligatory for the delivery of a complete 
intonation unit.
What makes a syllable a tonic syllable? Usually, in each intonation unit 
there will be one syllable more prominent than the others; it is made more 
prominent by a degree of loudness greater than the other syllables, and it is 
accompanied by a distinctive pitch movement or level. Th ere is sometimes a 
noticeable reduction in the pace of the syllables aft er the tonic syllable, com-
pared to the quicker pace beforehand. All these clues help, but they may not 
always be present together. Try and identify the tonic syllables in these four 
sentences:
 
9.2 i 
I think I’ll go and have a cup of tea
 
 ii 
where are you going on your holidays
 
 iii did you have a nice time
 
 iv look at that man up there

150
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 It should not be too diffi  cult to identify them; they were the last words in the 
fi rst three and the last one but two in the fourth sentence. Notice that they were 
all lexical items – content words, not grammatical items (‘structural’ words). 
In iv above, the last two words up there both belong to closed sets of locative 
adverbs and are thus treated as grammatical items. So, although man is not 
the last word, it is still the last lexical item. Note also that each sentence was a 
diff erent clause type: a declarative, a wh-interrogative (i.e. non-polar), a yes/no 
interrogative (i.e. polar) and an imperative; the type of clause seems to have no 
bearing on either tonality or tonicity.
 
Neutral and marked tonicity
 
 It is a general rule in English that the tonic syllable will be heard within the last 
lexical item of an intonation unit. Th is rule is pretty powerful, as in approxi-
mately 80 per cent of instances it will be found to be the case. Th is high propor-
tion of tonic locations is known as neutral tonicity. Neutral tonicity refers to 
the phenomenon that the tonic syllable will occur within the fi nal lexical item 
in its intonation unit. Th is is true for all examples above, apart from
 
 they’re \coming on Monday |
 
 In the approximately 20 per cent of intonation units where this is not the case, 
tonicity is said to be ‘marked’. Marked tonicity refers to those cases where the 
tonic occurs within a lexical item that is not fi nal, like the example immediately 
above, or it occurs with a grammatical item, as in
 
9.3 they \are coming on Monday
 
 Marked tonicity will always need a very particular context, as in these two 
cases. Th e second one, | they \are coming on Monday |, can only make sense in 
a context where the expectation of their arrival on Monday has been disputed 
or denied, i.e. the context is very particular.
Now listen again to Dangerous childhood pranks 1. Th e tonality has already 
been investigated; we could transcribe it as below. But this time, listen for the 
tonic syllable in each intonation unit. Again, start from line 5, as the speaker 
was still sorting out the story in his mind in the earlier lines. Underline the 
speaker’s choice of tonic syllable in each unit.

17
 
 You might now notice how many of the tonic syllables occur with the fi nal 
lexical item in each unit; these are cases of neutral tonicity.
Now try and identify the tonic syllables in the (scripted) monologue Come 
on, Gus. Again, the tonality of the monologue has been set out for you; all you 
have to do is underline the tonic syllable in each intonation unit. In line 1, there 
is one intonation unit that consists of only one word, Gus, and that word con-
sists of only one syllable; in this case, there is no choice! Where there is more 
than one word in an intonation unit, there is a potential for choice; underline 
the choice that the speaker has made. Also, try and identify which syllable is the 
tonic syllable in a polysyllabic word, e.g. holidays. (We can distinguish, theo-
retically, between tonic syllables as a phonological feature, tonic words from 
a semantic perspective, and the grammatical distinction between lexical and 
grammatical words – note the interplay of all three ‘levels of analysis’.)
Now underline what you think are the tonic syllables. Th ere is no need to be 
concerned yet about the pitch movements you hear.
 
8.42 Come on, Gus
 
 now then | Gus | don t be a fool | like you were last time |

 Here are some hints:
 
 Line 1: Which of the words now then is the more prominent? Is time more 
prominent than last, or vice versa?
 
 Line 2: Which of the words next time is the more prominent? Which syllable is 
tonic in seriously?

152
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 Line 3: Which of the words try again is the more prominent?
 
 Line 4: Can you think why thing is not prominent?
 
 Line 7: Note that up is part of the lexical item stand up.
 
 Line 10: Which of the words other lad is the more prominent?
 
 Line 13: Th e tonicity of the fi rst unit is tricky, so don’t worry if you think there 
is more than one tonic syllable! Which of the words good bloke is the more 
prominent?
 
Broad and narrow focus
 
 You will probably notice how oft en the tonic syllable occurs within the fi nal 
lexical item of each intonation unit, but not always. It sometimes occurs on 
a non-fi nal lexical item or on a grammatical item; we need now to investigate 
these cases of marked tonicity. Listen to these exchanges as extensions to the 
examples we introduced on p. 149; the tonicity of each fi rst turn is marked by 
underlining, as discussed above.
 
9.4 A: I think I’ll go and have a cup of tea |
 
 B: why don’t you come and have a meal |
 
 What A says could be the fi rst turn of a new conversational exchange, and 
everything that A says would be new information to the addressee, B. But what 
B says contains a lot of information that A has given already: you coming and 
having refers exactly to what A said about me going and having. Th e only thing 
new in B’s turn is meal; that is the focus of information in that unit. Because 
the focus is confi ned to just one element of the information, the focus is said 
to be narrow focus. Th is contrasts with the information of A’s turn in which 
all the information was new; in a case like this, the focus is said to be broad 
focus. Broad focus refers to all the information in an intonation unit being 
new, whereas narrow focus refers to only part of the information being new.
 
9.5 A: where are you going on your holidays |
 
 . . .
 
 B: where are you going on your holidays |
 
 What A says above could be the beginning of a new topic in a conversation, 
which A and B proceeded with. Th en later B might ask a similar question of A, 
but much of B’s question is repetition of what A had said, except that you and 
your refer to A, not B! Th at is why your is the focus of B’s question, a narrow 
focus, in contrast to the broad focus of A’s original question. (Perhaps you might 
be tonic also, in which case B’s turn becomes two intonation units with narrow 
focus in each: where are you going | on your holidays | .) Th e next example was:
 
9.6 A: did you have a nice time |
 
 B: we had an awful time |
 
 What A says above, here, has broad focus, but what B says has narrow focus 
because the information we having (some kind of ) time has already been given 
by A, i.e. A’s you is the same as B’s we. Th e last of those examples:

153
CHAPTER 9
Intonation: tonicity
 
9.7 A: look at that man up there
 
 B: and look at that man | up there
 
 What A says above, here, has broad focus; what B says has narrow focus. Even 
though B uses the same words as A, that and there contrast with A’s message.
In all these cases, note that broad focus takes neutral tonicity – the tonic syl-
lable within the fi nal lexical item of an intonation unit. Narrow focus usually 
takes marked tonicity – the tonic syllable either within a non-fi nal lexical item 
like B’s response, awful, or within a grammatical item like B’s responses, your 
(perhaps also you), that and there.
Occasionally, narrow focus has neutral tonicity like B’s response with the 
tonic on meal. So, how do people distinguish neutral tonicity with broad focus 
from neutral tonicity with narrow focus? Th e answer is that information that 
has already been given is pitched low, whereas new information usually is not. 
Compare A’s pitch on I think I’ll go and have a cup of (the pretonic segment) with 
B’s low pitch on why don’t you come and have a (the pretonic segment). Th us we 
make a distinction between new information and given (or old) information.
Now you can see why, for instance, the speaker in Dangerous childhood 
pranks 1 line 9 has narrow focus on Rick Holman’s and not upon shed, because 
shed is given information from the preceding intonation unit. Th e speaker in 
Come on, Gus lines 1 and 2 obviously regards time as given, referring to Gus’s 
previous experience. In line 4, thing refers back to the previous experience also; 
hence, the narrow focus lies elsewhere (dreadful is the new information). In 
line 10, lad is given, showing that the speaker regards Bernard in a previous 
intonation unit as a lad also; so other is new, as narrow focus. Similarly, in line 
13, bloke is treated as given information; the other people already mentioned 
are perceived as blokes too. Th e speaker also treats he in line 13 as new (narrow 
focus), although he, Jack has already been mentioned; he treats he as the focus 
as a way of contrast with the other ‘blokes’.
Marked tonicity happens with numbers too. Perhaps most well known is 
the traditional tonicity of football scores read out on the radio. Compare these 
two scores:
 
9.8 i 
Arsenal nil | Cardiff  City one |
 
 ii Arsenal one | Cardiff  City one |
 
 Th e fi rst, i, has broad focus in both its intonation units as all the informa-
tion they contain is new; tonicity is, therefore, neutral. (Th at was the score in 
1927 for the only occasion when the English FA Cup went outside England!) 
Th e second, ii, represents a drawn game, with one common to the two units; 
one thus drops out of focus with the tonic syllable shift ing to Ci-, which is 
marked tonicity. (NB In this instance, one is a lexical item as a number, and not 
a pronoun as in he wasn’t much of one.)
Something similar happens in telephone numbers and the like
 
9.9 i 
208 7 | 424 3 |
 
 ii 208 7 | 423 2 |

154
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 Th e fi rst, i, has neutral tonicity, but in the second unit of the second, ii, the 
very fi nal lexical item, two, is a repeat, and so the tonic syllable shift s to thirt-, 
 creating marked tonicity.
Marked tonicity can also feature in parts of words like elements of com-
pound words and affi  xes. Compare the word stress of these two instances of 
the compound book case:
 
9.10 i 
we need a book case |
 
 ii he’s got a book shelf | but we need a book case
 
 And then the word stress of these two instances of disinterested:
 
9.11 i 
Jack acted in a disinterested way |
 
 ii disinterested | or uninterested |
 
 A kind of marked tonicity takes place when the fi nal lexical item is a 
common verb of movement or happening which does not seem to add any-
thing to the message; these are oft en called ‘event clauses/sentences’. Listen to 
these:
 
9.12 i 
the phone rang |
 
 ii an accident has happened |
 
 iii your sister’s gone |
 
 iv the doctor’s coming |
 
 v an ambulance has been called |
 
 Th e verbs are fi nal lexical items, but they are semantically ‘empty’. Th e ‘move-
ment’ verbs do not add any information; it is the person who is moving that is 
signifi cant. Th e ‘happening’ verbs are semantically redundant, because ring is 
what phones do, happen is what takes place with accidents, and in emergen-
cies being called is what happens to ambulances. Th e verbs are required to fi ll 
syntactic places although they have little or no semantic eff ect. Technically, 
these verbs are lexical items in fi nal position, but since they do not ‘take’ the 
tonic syllable, the tonicity is marked. (Because there is a kind of mismatch 
between semantics and syntax in these cases, linguists do diff er in their inter-
pretation of the phonology of the tonicity of these cases; I have presented a 
simple  interpretation based on syntax.)
 
Final adjuncts
 
 A regular case of marked tonicity happens when adjuncts which contain lexical 
items appear in fi nal position in the clause, e.g.
 
9.13 i 
where did you go last week |
 
 ii what did you do all day |
 
 iii there was nothing to do in town |
 
 Adjuncts with no lexical content would not be expected to take the tonic 
 syllable when they appear in fi nal position, e.g.

155
CHAPTER 9
Intonation: tonicity
 
9.14 i 
what did you do today |
 
 ii there’s nothing to do here |
 
 and it seems that adjuncts with lexical content follow suit. If they took the tonic 
syllable, they would sound very much as if the information had narrow focus. 
Listen for the sense of contrast:
 
9.15 i 
where did you go last week | (‘as opposed to just yesterday’)
 
 ii what did you do all day | (‘not at night time’)
 
 iii there was nothing to do in town | (‘as opposed to somewhere else’)
 
 iv what did you do today | (‘not yesterday’)
 
 v there’s nothing to do here | (‘as opposed to there’)
 
 Here are some more contrasting examples with fi nal adjuncts:
 
9.16 i 
he didn’t want to jot it down again | (jot down = last lexical item; neutral 
tonicity)
 
 ii he didn’t want to jot it down again | (again = grammatical item; marked 
tonicity)
 
 also
 
9.17 i 
they needed to think it over together | (think over = last lexical item; neutral 
tonicity)
 
 ii they needed to think it over together | (together = grammatical item; marked 
tonicity)
 
 and
 
9.18 i 
she might not come back then | (come back = last lexical item; neutral tonic-
ity)
 
 ii she might not come back then | (then = grammatical item; marked  
tonicity)
 
 Final adjuncts which function for comment, viewpoint, reporting and glosses 
on the subject are usually ‘out of focus’, i.e. non-tonic, whether they contain 
lexical items or not. Here are some examples:
 
9.19 i 
she wanted to speak like a lady though |
 
 ii she wanted to speak like a lady of course |
 
 iii she wanted to speak like a lady however |
 
 iv she wanted to speak like a lady you see |
 
 v she wanted to speak like a lady at least |
 
 also
 
9.20 she was in a poor state economically | (viewpoint)
 
 and
 
9.21 she wanted to have lessons she said | (reporting)
 
 and

156
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
9.22 they re all the same these professors | (a gloss)
 
 Certain adjuncts usually take the tonic because of the force of their meaning; 
thus they create utterances with marked tonality:
 
9.23 she wanted to dress like a lady | too | ( also also, as well)
 
9.24 she wasn t sure about Pickering | either |
 
9.25 should she leave | or stay | instead |
 
 Finally, as we have already seen, vocatives in fi nal position in the clause oft en 
are ‘non-tonic’ (look back at the second example in 8.17 on p. 143). Th is gives 
the potential for possible ambiguity with some verbs that can operate in either 
transitive or intransitive mode:
 
9.26 i 
don t shoot Joe (Joe = vocative)
 
 ii don t shoot Joe (shoot = transitive; Joe = direct object!)
 
 A similar ambiguity presents itself with refl exive pronouns acting as direct 
object and emphatic pronouns in fi nal position:
 
9.27 i 
she asked herself (herself = refl exive; ‘she wondered’)
 
 ii she asked herself (herself = emphatic: ‘she was the one who did the 
asking’)

CHAPTER 9
Intonation: tonicity
 
 Hints:
 
 Line 1: the very fi rst unit is tricky, and you may hear two tonics, but which is 
the more prominent? More on this in the next chapter on Tone. Which is more 
prominent: Bernard or mentioned?
 
 Line 2: treat | um . before um | as an abandoned unit.
 
 Line 3: treat | we used to . cycle down | as an abandoned unit; the information 
seems to be abandoned before it is taken up again in Line 4.
 
 Line 5: treat | because we um | as an abandoned unit.
 
 Line 10: as we noted on p. 143, the speaker seems to stumble over the tonality 
of the fi rst unit on this line; the tonicity must follow his tonality choice, which 
means that in will be the tonic syllable in its own intonation unit.
 
 Line 13–14: water is the only lexical item in this unit, but does it take the tonic?
And fi nally, try and act the director again for this passage of Pygmalion, and 
underline the tonic syllables as you imagine them to be.

10 Intonation: tone
 
 Tone is the level and movement of pitch within an intonation unit. Primary 
tone refers to the system of contrasting movements of pitch within the tonic 
segment (i.e. tonic syllable and tail); the basic system is a choice between fall (\), 
rise (/) and fall-rise (V). Secondary tone refers to variations to the basic primary 
system and also to levels and movements in the pretonic segment (i.e. pre-head 
and head).
Th e primary tone system functions in two dimensions: the speaker’s organi-
zation of their information, and the speaker’s role in interpersonal communica-
tion (whether the speaker is, for example, stating something, asking a question, 
telling someone to do something, greeting, wishing a happy birthday, etc.). Th e 
informational aspect of tone will be dealt with fi rst, then the communicative 
aspect, in this chapter; secondary tones will be dealt with in the next chapter.
 
Tones
 
 Listen to this statement:
 
10.1 we used to dive straight into the sea
 
 You should hear it as one intonation unit with the fi nal lexical item as the 
tonic. Th is means that the speaker intended this as a single piece of informa-
tion (tonality) with broad focus (tonicity). Th e tone indicates the status of the 
information; in this case, it was a fall. Th e intonation of this example will now 
look like this:
 
10.2 we used to dive straight into the \sea |
 
 with tonality, tonicity and tone all marked. Note that all three systems of tonal-
ity, tonicity and tone will always operate in every intonation unit – unless, of 
course, a unit is begun and then abandoned.
Now listen to the same wording with a diff erent tone:
 
10.3 we used to dive straight into the sea |
 
 Th e tonality and tonicity remain the same, but the tone changes to a rise, with 
the eff ect that the statement now sounds incomplete, as if the speaker is about 
to add something else (e.g. but we got rid of our bikes in mid air). Th e  intonation 
of this second rendering will now look like this:
• we used to dive straight into the /sea |

159
CHAPTER 10
Intonation: tone
 
 Th e speaker thus has a choice between a fall and a rise (in linguistic terms, 
the speaker operates a system of tone). Th e rise in these cases ‘means’ incom-
plete information and depends on further information for it to make sense, 
whereas the fall ‘means’ that the information can be understood independently 
of any other information and can be considered as major information. It is 
the speaker who decides. Th e speaker knows what information they wish to 
provide and the status of each piece of information is indicated by their choice 
of tone. Listen to this statement:
 
 we used to dive straight into the /sea | but we got rid of our bikes in mid \air |
 
 Th e speaker uses the rise in the fi rst unit of intonation to indicate that they 
have not completed the message, and uses the fall in the second to indicate 
that that was the main point of the message, the major piece of information. 
Th is sequence of rise + fall is inevitably a frequent feature of spoken discourse. 
Sequences of fall + fall are also very frequent:
 
10.4 we used to dive straight into the \sea | and get rid of our bikes in mid \air |
 
 In this case, the speaker manages the message as two pieces of major informa-
tion; that is how they viewed it on that particular occasion. Listen once again 
to Dangerous childhood pranks 1 and notice how many pieces of information 
are accompanied by falls. Mark each fall with \ directly before the tonic syllable 
itself. Th e tonality and tonicity have already been transcribed.

17
 
 In the telling of this narrative, the speaker handles practically all the new pieces 
of information as major; you can tell that he is ‘composing’ as he goes along, 
and the rapid sequence of falls probably adds to the sense of excitement he 
feels. Th ere was at least one instance of rise + fall of some kind in lines 10–11:

160
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
• – and we were playing about with the /thing | . and we messed a\bout with 
it |
 
 indicating incomplete information and then major.
Th e falls and rises are contrasting pitch movements on the tonic syllable; if 
there is a tail, it will end low with a fall, but high with a rise. Th at is an impor-
tant clue if you feel unsure about the pitch movement itself. Listen to the pitch 
movement of these tones in tonic segments that contain tails:
 
10.5 i 
we used to dive straight into the \reservoir |
 
 ii we used to dive straight into the /reservoir | . . .
 
 In order to eff ect a fall, the pitch of the voice must start relatively high and 
then fall to a lower pitch, which is heard easily when there is a tail. But the 
relatively high starting pitch for the fall might be higher than the pitch in the 
pretonic segment, and it might sound to you as if the pitch has gone up before 
it goes down. Th is is one reason for identifying the tonic syllable clearly, in 
order to distinguish the pitch movement on the tonic syllable from the pre-
ceding pitch movement or level in the pretonic. It is the pitch movement in 
the tonic segment that counts, not any ‘jump up’ in pitch from the pretonic 
to the tonic; that ‘jump up’ is merely an adjustment to the pitch to reach 
the required level for the fall and is automatic (and, therefore, can never be 
 contrastive).
Similarly, in order to eff ect a rise, the pitch of the voice must start relatively 
low and then rise to a higher pitch, which, again, is heard easily when there 
is a tail. But the relatively low starting pitch for the rise might be lower than 
the pitch in the pretonic segment, and it might sound to you as if the pitch 
has gone down before it goes up. Th is ‘jump down’ is the same kind of auto-
matic adjustment that has just been mentioned for the fall. Again, it is the pitch 
movement in the tonic segment that counts. It is necessary to distinguish this 
automatic adjustment from the actual tone itself in the tonic segment. Here 
are those two examples again in ‘slow motion’; notice the pitch adjustment 
between the (at the end of the pretonic) and res- (at the beginning of the tonic 
segment):
 
10.6 i 
we used to dive straight into the \reservoir |
 
 ii we used to dive straight into the /reservoir | . . .
 
 Another frequent sequence – beside fall + fall, and rise + fall – is fall + rise. 
Listen to this statement:
 
10.7 we used to dive straight into the sea | at high tide |
 
 Th e tonality has been transcribed for you: two intonation units, two pieces 
of information. Th e tonicity has also been transcribed, as broad focus. Th e 
fall in the fi rst unit indicates that the speaker is treating that information as 
major, but what does the rise in the second mean? It cannot mean incomplete 
information because of its position at the end of the sequence. In cases like 
these, a distinction is made between major and minor information; the fi nal 

161
CHAPTER 10
Intonation: tone
rise ‘means’ that this information is added as relevant, but it is treated as of 
only secondary importance compared to the major information. It has a lower 
status of information. Rises in this informational aspect of intonation indicate 
that the information has to be understood in relation to some other informa-
tion; it has a status of being ‘dependent’ on something that the speaker treats as 
major (‘independent’).
Here are two other examples of fall + rise, i.e. of major + minor information, 
from Come on, Gus, lines 5 and 13:
 
10.8 I wouldn t trust them | to be honest |
 
10.9 he s too good a bloke | frankly |
 
 To be honest and frankly are added by the speaker as pieces of extra 
(interpersonal) information, rather like a comment, and are obviously going 
to  be treated as minor. Th ese last three examples would be transcribed as 
follows:
• we used to dive straight into the \sea | at high /tide |
• I wouldn t \trust them | to be /honest
• he s too \good a bloke | /frankly |
 
 Minor information very oft en consists of fi nal adjuncts. We saw in the previous 
chapter that they usually do not take the tonic unless they indicate a contrast, 
but they can appear in their ‘own’ intonation unit if the speaker wishes to give 
them some degree of prominence without making them the major information 
(like contrast). Listen to these statements:
 
10.10 I took a day off  | last week
 
 but there was nothing to do | in town
 
 so I slept | the rest of the day
 
 Other examples were also presented in the previous chapter; here are examples 
from p. 155 with fi nal adjuncts given some (minor) prominence:
 
10.11 i 
she wanted to speak like a \lady | /though |
 
 ii she wanted to speak like a \lady | of /course |
 
 iii she wanted to speak like a \lady | how/ever |
 
 iv she wanted to speak like a \lady | you /see |
 
 v she wanted to \speak like a lady | at /least |
 
10.12 she was in a poor \state | eco/nomically |
 
10.13 she wanted to have \lessons | she /said |
 
10.14 they re all the \same | these pro/fessors |
 
 Final adjuncts may therefore be treated as either major information (with \), 
or as minor information (with /) or as given information (non-tonic). It is the 
speaker who decides. Th ey choose the information status that is required as 
appropriate to their purposes.

162
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
Th e system for information status so far is:
 
 major 
\
 
 incomplete 
/ (non-fi nal)
 
 minor  
/ (fi nal)
 
 Th e complete system for information status also includes the fall-rise tone 
(V). Th e fall-rise indicates major information that is somehow not complete 
in itself; it implies an extra, unspoken, message that the speaker expects the 
addressee to understand. Th e dimension of major information is indicated by 
the fall element; the incompleteness of the spoken message is indicated by the 
rise element. Listen to these examples.
Imagine Jack and Jill going out together for the fi rst time, and then Jack’s 
friends quizzing him about Jill, and Jill’s friends quizzing her about Jack. Th ey 
might ask him ‘What is she like?’ and he might reply:
 
10.15 
\yes | she s o \k |
 
 with positive major information, but if he replies:
 
10.16 she s o Vk |
 
 there is still major information, but it does not sound so positive because he 
implies another unspoken message which has a but about it. He does not deny 
that she’s OK, but it is clear that there is another message which he expects his 
addressee(s) to be able to interpret too. Th is is implied information.
Similarly, Jill’s friends might ask ‘What is he like?’ and she might reply:
 
10.17 he s very \nice |
 
 with positive major information, but if she replies:
 
10.18 he s very Vnice |
 
 it does not sound as if she will plan to go out with him again! Her fall-rise also 
implies an unspoken ‘but message’. Th e major information is given; it is not 
denied, but its signifi cance is compromised by an implied extra message. Th e 
extra message might not always be a ‘but message’; it might signal simply ‘think 
about what this means’ or ‘this is my opinion on the matter’; for instance
• they re coming on VMonday |
 
 might mean ‘So we’d better get things ready for them right now’. Th e extra, 
unspoken, message that is implied is meant to be understood by the addressee 
from the connection between the spoken message and the situational factors.
Both the fall and rise elements are pronounced within the tonic syllable. If 
there is a tail, the two elements are spread though the tonic segment, e.g.
 
10.19 he s very conVsiderate
 
 with the fall occurring on the tonic syllable and the rise delayed till the end of 
the segment, -rate. Th e V symbol is placed just before the tonic syllable, since 

163
CHAPTER 10
Intonation: tone
the placement of the rise element is automatic. (If you separate the two parts of 
the symbol as
• con\side/rate
 
 it is possible that it might be interpreted as fall + rise, especially if there are a 
number of words in the tail.)
Th e fall-rise also occurs in a non-fi nal position, and typically with the theme 
at the beginning of a clause. Its function then is to highlight the theme. An 
example occurs in Come on, Gus line 2:
 
10.20 
Vnext time | check the \tide |
 
 In this case, there is marked theme as something other than the subject appears 
at the beginning of the clause. Marked theme, as such, does not require to be 
highlighted with V, but the speaker chose to do so on that occasion. He could 
also have said:
 
10.21 
/next time | check the \tide |
 
 with a simple rise to indicate incomplete information; that would have been 
quite acceptable. But the speaker actually chose the fall-rise with the intention 
of drawing attention to the theme. A neutral theme could also be highlighted:
 
10.22 
VBernard | was not much of a \friend |
 
 Th eme is a notion about the information structure of the clause. We can now 
add the functions of the fall-rise in fi nal and non-fi nal positions to the system 
network for information status:
 
 major information 
\
 
 minor information 
/ (fi nal)
 
 incomplete information 
/ (non-fi nal)
 
 implied information 
V(fi nal)
 
 highlighted theme 
V(non-fi nal)
 
 Th e system can be illustrated as follows:
 
10.23 Gus never checked the \tide |
 
 Gus never checked the \tide | be/forehand
 
 Gus never checked the /tide | . . .
 
 Gus never checked the Vtide |
 
 
VGus | never checked the \tide |
 
 It should also be noted that the fall-rise can occur with questions and 
 commands:
 
 did Gus ever check the Vtide |
 
 
\Gus | check the Vtide |
 
 Th e implication in the question is that the speaker is identifying the actual 
focus of the question: ‘I think he might have checked other things, but I don’t 

164
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
know about the tide’ – a narrow focus with neutral tonicity. Th e implication in 
the command is similar: ‘I think you should at least do that.’
It should also be noted that a change in the tone system is taking place in 
UK at present, by which the fall-rise is oft en used simply to mark incomplete 
information in non-fi nal position in casual, informal discourse like Dangerous 
childhood pranks 1. this is probably how best to interpret the fall-rise in line 
11:
• . and we messed aVbout with it |
 
 Th ere does not seem to be a sense of an extra implied message here, and in any 
case, it is not fi nal.
A fi nal note on long tails! Th e longer the tail, the easier it is to decide whether 
the tone was a fall, a rise or a fall-rise. Take, for instance, line 1 of Dangerous 
childhood pranks 2:
 
 the \other thing that we used to do |
 
 Th e tail –er thing we used to do is kept on a low pitch throughout, which pro-
vides the evidence that the speaker had used a fall on the tonic syllable oth-. We 
could render that same statement as incomplete information:
 
10.24 the /other thing that we used to do |
 
 with the tail rising slightly to a mid pitch; or even as highlighted them:
 
10.25 the Vother thing that we used to do |
 
 with the fall on the tonic syllable oth-, a low pitch through the tail until the 
rise element on the last stressed syllable do. If there is no stressed syllable in 
the tail, the rise element will automatically accompany the fi nal unstressed 
syllable, as in 10.20 above. One fi nal example must suffi  ce: line 13 of Come on, 
Gus:
• ˅he won t leave you to look aft er yourself |
 
 with the fall on the tonic syllable he, a low pitch through the tail until the 
rise element starting on the last stressed syllable aft - and continuing with the 
remaining unstressed syllables. Th e fall-rise spreads, or is ‘split’, throughout 
the tail, with the rise element automatically accompanying the fi nal stressed 
syllable, or otherwise the fi nal unstressed syllable.
We have now not only completed the study of primary tones in information 
structure, but also the study of all the intonation systems – tonality, tonicity 
and tone – in information structure. Choices in all three systems must be made 
for each intonation unit (unless it gets abandoned). Th e speaker decides how to 
divide their whole message into separate pieces of information, what the focus 
of each piece of information should be and what status each piece should have. 
But language does more than convey messages (the experiential metafunc-
tion); it also expresses speakers’ communicative functions (the interpersonal 
metafunction), and it is to this that we now turn our attention.

165
CHAPTER 10
Intonation: tone
 
Statements and questions
 
 We have illustrated so far the use of tones in statements, whether those state-
ments contained major, minor, incomplete or implied information or a high-
lighted theme. But people ask questions too, and tell other people what to do, 
and greet one another, and wish someone a happy birthday, and engage in 
many, many other types of communication.
A statement with major information takes a fall. Notice that we have com-
bined reference to two metafunctions in that preceding sentence: experiential 
(major information) and interpersonal (statement). A statement means that the 
speaker knows some information and tells it to someone else. A question, on the 
other hand, means that the speaker does not know something and asks for that 
information from someone else who they assume does know the information. 
When the fl ower girl spoke to Mrs Pearce, she did not know whether Mrs Pearce 
had told Professor Higgins that she had come in a taxi; so she asks a question:
• Did you tell him I come in a taxi |
 
 As the director of the play, you would expect her to use a rising tone as a signal 
that this was a question.
So rises indicate questions as well as incomplete and minor information. 
How can a person tell what function a rise carries in any given unit of into-
nation? Th e answer is not too diffi  cult (at least, in theory!): if the rise is con-
tained in an intonation unit that is attached to (or, ‘dependent’ on) another 
intonation unit that contains a fall (major information) or a fall-rise (implied 
information), then it indicates either incomplete information (if non-fi nal) or 
minor information (if fi nal). But if the rise is contained in an intonation unit 
that is independent, then it indicates a question. Compare:
 
10.26 i 
this is the girl I jotted down last \night (he knows, and tells)
 
 ii is this the girl I jotted down last /night (he does not know, and asks)
 
 Th e tone contrast is parallel to the contrasting tones in tags, as we saw on p. 131
• you under\stand | \don t you
• you under\stand | /don t you
 
 Th e fi rst sounds more like a statement: a checking tag with a sense of being 
sure. Th e second sounds more like a question: a checking tag with a sense of 
not being sure and having to ask.
Questions like is this the girl I jotted down last night? are known as polar 
interrogatives, because the required answer is either Yes or No – hence the 
more familiar designation yes/no questions. Th ey are usually accompanied by 
a rise:
 
10.27 is the tide /in
 
 is it deep e/nough
 
 shall I dive /in
 
 is it o /k

166
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
 Th ere is another type of question, the non-polar interrogatives which cannot 
be answered with either Yes or No. Th ese questions usually begin with a wh 
item: who, whose, what, which, when, where, why and how – hence the more 
familiar designation wh- questions. Th ey require the supply of some informa-
tion. Wh- questions are usually accompanied by a fall. You might wonder why 
this is so, if the speaker is actually asking a question. Th e reason is that the 
speaker does, in fact, know the basic proposition of the message, but there is a 
gap that aff ects full knowledge. For instance:
 
10.28 who is in the water (they know that someone is in the water, but not who)
 
 how deep is it (they know that it has some degree of depth, but not how 
much)
 
 when is the tide right in (they know that the tide will be right in, but not when)
 
 why are you kneeling down (they know that the others are kneeling down, but 
not why)
 
 where have you put my bike (they know that their bike has been put  somewhere, 
but not exactly where)
 
 Th e proposition of the message might seem very simple as in
 
10.29 who are you (you must be someone, but I don’t know who)
 
 what is your name (you must have a name, but I don’t know it)
 
 how are you (you must be in some condition, but I don’t know what)
 
 why are you here (you are here, but I don’t know why)
 
 or
 
 where are you (you must be somewhere, but I don’t know exactly where)
 
 Because the main proposition is known, even these short wh- questions will 
typically take a fall.
Commands also take falls. So, for instance when Professor Higgins tells the 
fl ower girl to go, he would almost certainly use a fall:
 
10.30 be \off  with you
 
 And when she replies with her protest, in an imperative clause structure, she 
too will use a fall:
 
10.31 don t you be so \saucy
 
 Exclamations are also usually accompanied by a fall. Th ese examples all come 
from the Pygmalion passage:
 
10.32 why (line 1)
 
 nonsense girl
 
 oh | we are proud
 
 well (lines 10, 15, 17)
 
 Th e use of primary tones for communicative functions described so far can be 
summarized as follows:

167
CHAPTER 10
Intonation: tone
Statements: declarative clauses: \
Questions: polar interrogative clauses (‘yes/no’): /
non-polar interrogative clauses (‘wh’): \
Commands: imperative clauses: \
Exclamations: minor clauses: \
 
 And this is as far as most traditional descriptions of English go. But our talk 
– and life itself! – embraces much more than these fi ve types of communica-
tion. Th e above summary is based on clause types alone, not upon the kind of 
discourses that we engage in. We will now proceed with a fuller range of com-
municative functions in discourse, and for convenience will divide the range 
into three general categories:
• knowledge, i.e. ways of sharing information
• infl uence, i.e. ways of infl uencing other people’s actions
• social interaction, i.e. ways of relating to other people
 
 
*
 
 Communicative functions which involve knowledge include statements and 
the two kinds of question, but they also involve responses, agreement and disa-
greement, denials, affi  rmations, hypotheses, contradictions, conditions, etc., 
etc. In general terms, if the speaker knows something and imparts that infor-
mation, they use a fall; if the speaker does not know something and seeks that 
information, they use a rise. Put diff erently, the fall indicates dominance in the 
communicative act (a person knows and tells), and the rise deference (a person 
does not know; i.e. the person defers to the person who, they assume, does have 
the knowledge).
Statements take a fall and are usually worded as declarative clauses. But it is 
possible to use a declarative clause for a diff erent purpose with a rise:
 
10.33 he got you a /gun |
 
 Th is is a challenge, with the intention of seeking confi rmation that he got 
him a gun is actually true. Contradictions also take a declarative clause with a 
rise:
 
10.34 it wasn t /so dangerous
 
 Wh- questions usually take a fall, but can also be accompanied by a rise for a 
diff erent communicative eff ect:
 
10.35 
/what did he get you
 
 Th is is an ‘echo question’; it ‘echoes’ the wording of the previous speaker as a 
way of seeking confi rmation that they have heard correctly.
Yes/no questions usually take a rise and are worded as polar interroga-
tives. But it is possible to use a polar interrogative with a fall, with a diff erent 
 communicative eff ect:

168
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
10.36 aren t you going to dive \in
 
 Th is is not so much a real question, but a statement that in the speaker’s opinion 
the addressee should comply. Th is so-called statement question has also oft en 
been called a ‘conducive’ question, because the speaker is seeking to ‘conduce’ 
the addressee’s response. Compare these two renderings:
 
10.37 i 
were you /always taking the mickey out of him | (‘I don’t know; tell me’)
 
 ii were you \always taking the mickey out of him | (‘I think you were’)
 
 Exclamations in interrogative form take a fall. Compare:
 
10.38 i 
wasn t it /stupid | (‘I don’t know; tell me’)
 
 ii wasn t it \stupid | (exclamation like ‘How stupid!’)
 
 We sometimes use polar interrogatives to get people to say something 
(‘prompts’) or as a preliminary to something we wish to tell (‘lead-ins’):
 
10.39 have you considered the \consequences | (‘Tell me what you think’)
 
10.40 did you hear what happened to Gus \Hughes | (‘Well, I’m going to tell you!’)
 
 Repeat Yes/no questions take a fall, as if the message is ‘What I said was. . .’:
 
10.41 A: did you get rid of your bike in mid /air | (genuine question)
 
 B: /pardon
 
 A: did you get rid of your bike in mid \air | (repeat question: ‘What I said was 
. . .’)
 
 Similarly, second attempt questions take a fall:
 
10.42 A: was it ten foot /deep | (fi rst question)
 
 B: \no |
 
 A: was it \eight foot then | (‘second attempt’ question)
 
 Notice the diff erence between closed list questions and open list questions:
 
10.43 i 
was it /you | or /Bernard | or /Joe | (open list question, not completed)
 
 ii was it /you | or /Bernard | or \Joe | (closed list question; ‘It was one of you’)
 
 and
 
10.44 i 
did you take the /mickey out of him | or \not | (closed list question)
 
 ii did you take the /mickey out of him | or was he just a \fool | (closed list ques-
tion)
 
 Responses usually take a fall, as do expressions of agreement and  disagreement, 
etc.
 
10.45 
\yes |
 
 
\no |
 
 I don t \know |
 
 I \don t | \no |

 Now try and identify the tones of Dangerous childhood pranks 2. Listen out for 
a few more rises than in Dangerous childhood pranks 1; they indicate incom-
plete or minor information or a question – but not all interrogative clauses are

Directives
 
 Communicative functions that involve infl uencing someone’s action are 
sometimes called ‘directives’ or instances of ‘suasion’. If the speaker feels that 
they have authority to get another person to do something, like parent with 
child, boss with employee, policeman in a crowd, or a professor with a fl ower 
girl, etc. – i.e. feel dominance – they use a fall. If the speaker does not feel 
they have authority but leaves the other person to decide, they use a rise – in 
deference. In this way, for instance, a command carries a falling tone, but a 
request a rise; for a request to be truly regarded as a request, the speaker has 
to allow the other person to decide to act or not. Compare these commands 
and requests:
 
10.46 i 
I want you back at \nine (a command)
 
 ii can you be back at /nine (a request)
 
 and

170
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
10.47 i 
be back at \nine (a command)
 
 ii be back at /nine (a request)
 
 Also compare these other contrasts in dominance (\) and deference (/):
 
10.48 i 
don’t argue with your \mother (a prohibition)
 
 ii don’t argue with your /mother (a plea)
 
 also
 
10.49 i 
come \on (a demand)
 
 ii come /on (coaxing)
 
 and
 
10.50 i 
check your \watch (advice)
 
 ii check your /watch (suggestion)
 
 and
 
10.51 i 
you should check your \watch (advice)
 
 ii you could check your /watch (suggestion)
 
 and
 
10.52 i 
you could go with your \sister (recommendation)
 
 ii would you like to go with your /sister (invitation)
 
 and
 
10.53 i 
I’ll be back at \nine (a promise)
 
 ii I could be back before /then (an off er)
 
 also
 
10.54 i 
don’t you \dare be late (a threat)
 
 ii you shouldn’t talk like /that (an appeal)
 
 and fi nally
 
10.55 i 
\watch it (a threat)
 
 ii 
/watch it (a warning)
 
 Notice that, like requests, pleas, coaxing, suggestions, invitations, off ers, 
appeals and warnings – if they are to be genuine – allow the addressee to 
decide; they could refuse a request, but not a command; they could go along 
with a plea, but they would have no choice with a prohibition; they could resist 
any coaxing, but not a demand; advice, recommendations and threats come 
with authority, but suggestions, invitations, appeals and warnings allow the 
addressee to make the fi nal decision to act or not. Promises come with moral 
commitment; off ers give the addressee options. Authority, or dominance, is 
signalled with the fall; deference to the addressee’s right to decide is signalled 
with a rise.

171
CHAPTER 10
Intonation: tone
However, if a more formal lexicalized expression of the communicative 
function is used, a fall is used.

 I plead with you for \help |
 
 I suggest ten \pounds |
 
 we would like to invite you for a \meal |
 
 our off er is on the \table |

Social interaction
 
 Communicative functions for social interaction also diff erentiate between 
dominance and deference. Dominance in social interaction is the expression of 
the speaker’s own feelings and is signalled by a fall; deference is a consideration 
of the addressee’s feelings and is signalled by a rise. Consider the diff erence in 
greetings:
 
10.57 i 
good \morning (formal, i.e. speaker’s feelings dominate)
 
 ii good /morning (friendly, i.e. speaker considers the addressee’s feelings)
 
 and also
 
10.58 nice to /see you (friendly, thinking of the addressee)
 
 Farewells:
 
10.59 i

 also
 
10.61 good \riddance (fi rm, command-like; it does not seem possible with the more 
friendly rise!)

 Th ey can be contrasted with expressions of concession, acquiescence and

addressee’s feelings:

11 Intonation: secondary tone
 
Secondary tones
 
 Secondary tone refers to variations to the basic primary system of \, / and V, 
and also to levels and movements in the pretonic segment (i.e. pre-head and 
head). Variations to the primary system involve degrees of fall, rise and fall-rise 
and these variations indicate something of the speaker’s attitude or strength of 
feeling in expressing their message. Such variations can easily be demonstrated 
by listening to three variations of the following statement:
 
11.1 i 
they re coming on \Monday |
 
 ii they re coming on \Monday |
 
 iii they re coming on \Monday |
 
 Th e fi rst is a plain statement; the second is that very same statement but 
expressed more strongly as if to correct the addressee’s expectation; and the 
third is expressed more mildly as if to confi rm the addressee’s expectation.
Th e fall in ii above starts from a higher pitch, higher than the automatic 
adjustment explained on p. 160; in other words, the speaker has chosen to 
manipulate the adjustment to express strength of feeling. In iii above, the 
speaker manipulates the adjustment to a lower starting point for the fall to 
express mildness.
Listen yet again to the narratives that we have been examining, but this time 
listen for falls that are higher or lower than normal. Overwrite any fall with a 
higher starting point with / and any fall with a lower than normal starting point 
with \.

17
 
 You might possibly have heard gun with a high fall, as speaker B tries to 
help speaker A out and does so with a touch of surprise. Line 6 eight seems 
higher than normal and sounds as if it conveys the speaker’s surprise that the 
ammunition fi tted the gun, perhaps unexpectedly. Line 9 Holmans’s sounds 
low as if the name was well known to his addressees. Line 13 has fi red high 
as if to express the speaker’s feeling that this action would be opposite to 
the addressees’ expectations, and shed likewise. Line 15 has froze high as the 
speaker emphasizes the participants’ shock at what happened. Outrageous 
(line 16) is typical of those words with a powerful meaning and will oft en take 
a high tone. Th e high tone on concept (line 17) expresses the speaker’s sense of 
 incredulity.
Th e ‘meaning’ of the high fall has been glossed by other authors variously 
as ‘intense’, ‘personal concern’, ‘involvement’, ‘liveliness’, ‘more emotional’, 
‘surprise’, ‘strong surprise’, ‘vigorous agreement or contradiction’. Th is kind 
of variety of ‘meanings’ depends very much on other contributory factors like 
the speaker’s choice of lexis, their gestures and situational factors. For instance, 
this statement
 
11.2 it s the po\lice
 
 might express ‘surprise’, or in another situation ‘great relief’, or in yet another 
‘shock’! Facial gestures like wide opened eyes, eyes closed, frowns, smiles, 
pouts and a wrinkled up nose, and vocal gestures like loudness, whisper, 
speed, breathy or creaky voice all contribute also to ‘meaning’. However, the 
 contribution of the high fall is simply strength of feeling.
Similarly, the low fall has been glossed as ‘cool’, ‘calm’, ‘phlegmatic’, 
‘detached’, ‘reserved’, ‘dispassionate’, ‘dull’, ‘possibly grim’, ‘surly’, ‘unexcited’, 
but once again, the exact description would depend on the accompanying 
lexis, gestures and situational factors. In general terms, the contribution of the 
low fall simply indicates mildness of feeling. Th us there is a threefold system of 
attitudinal expression:
 
 
\so strong
 
 
\so neutral
 
 
\so mild
 
 A further addition to this system is the rise-fall. Th e rise-fall consists of both a 
rise and then a fall on the tonic syllable. Remember that with an ordinary fall, 
there is usually a ‘jump up’ from the pitch of the end of the pretonic to a higher 

178
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
starting pitch of the fall; see p. 160. In the case of the rise-fall, the speaker 
manipulates this ‘jump up’ by ‘vocalizing’ it as a rise. Th us
 
11.3 i 
it s the po˄lice
 
 expresses a greater level of surprise, etc. If the rise-fall is pitched low, this 
intense expression is increased with a greater sense of awe or shock. It is usually 
accompanied by breathy voice quality:
 
 ii it s the po˄lice
 
 Th us the whole system with falls is:
 
 ˄so intense, with emotion
 
 ˄so intense
 
 
\so strong
 
 
\so neutral
 
 
\so mild
 
 Th e attitudinal system with rises is simpler. What is most noticeable is the 
extent of the rise, either to a higher pitch than normal, or to a lower pitch:
 
11.4 i 
they re coming on /Monday | . . .
 
 ii they re coming on /Monday |
 
 iii they re coming on /Monday |
 
 Th e fi rst rendering, i above, is a plain statement with incomplete information. 
Th e second, ii, is a challenge (look back at p. 167), with the purpose of seeking 
confi rmation of what the addressee has just said. Th e third, iii, with a low rise, 
sounds either non-committal or even grudging, with quite a negative ‘ring’ to 
it. Th ese three renderings can be matched with yes/no questions:
 
11.5 i 
are they coming on /Monday |
 
 ii are they coming on /Monday |
 
 iii are they coming on /Monday |
 
 Th e fi rst rendering, i, is a plain yes/no question. Th e second, ii, is the very same 
question with strong feeling, e.g. surprise (‘I didn’t know that’). Th e third, iii, 
has the same negative ‘ring’ as 11.4iii. So the system so far can be set out as 
follows:
 
 
/so strong
 
 
/so neutral
 
 
/so non-committal
 
 Th e categories are similar but with the reverse direction of the pitch move-
ment, and so it might be tempting to extend the system to include the reverse 
of the rise-fall with questions, i.e. the fall-rise. But the fall-rise with yes/no ques-
tions has already briefl y been mentioned (pp. 163–4) as indicating a focus of 
information, rather than the expression of an attitude. But there is an extension 
to the above system, with the inclusion of a mid level tone.

179
CHAPTER 11
Intonation: secondary tone
Mid level tones are usually non-fi nal, and so fi t neatly alongside the rise for 
incomplete information. Th e ‘meaning’ of the mid level tone has been glossed 
as ‘marking non-fi nality without conveying any expression of expectancy’, 
‘routine’, ‘bored’, ‘pre-coded’, ‘oblique’. It occurs in inventories and routine 
announcements; it oft en accompanies marked theme without attempting to 
make it prominent, simply ‘syntactic dependence’. Here are some examples:
 
11.6 –Monday | –Tuesday | –Wednesday | –Th ursday | \Friday
 
 –Newport | Bristol –Parkway | –Swindon | –Reading | and London \Paddington
 
 on –Monday | she goes to \Bristol | on –Tuesday | she goes to \Swansea | . . .
 
 When preceded by a low head/pretonic, the mid level tone gives the  impression 
of a kind of routine listing. Compare these two renderings of a list:
 
11.7 i 
they re coming on /Monday | staying on /Tuesday | and /Wednesday | and
\Th ursday |
 
 ii they re coming on –Monday | staying on –Tuesday | and –Wednesday | 
and –Th ursday | as they \always do |
 
 Th us the mid level tone ‘means’ something like ‘as is well known’, hence the 
glosses ‘pre-coded’ and ‘routine’. Th e system then is:
  
 
/so strong
 
 
/so neutral
 
 –so routine
 
 
/so non-committal
 
 Th e fall-rise has a low variety, matching the low rise-fall described above, with 
a matching eff ect: implied information with strong emotion. Like the low 
 rise-fall, it is oft en accompanied by breathy voice. Compare:
 
11.8 i 
they re coming on VMonday |
 
 ii they re coming on ˅Monday |
 
 also
 
 I suppose we ll have to call the po˅lice |
 
 Th ere is just a two item system:
 
 
Vso neutral
 
 ˅so intense, with emotion
 
 Th ese are all the variations to the basic, primary, tones – the secondary tones in 
the tonic segment.
 
Heads and pre-heads
 
 We now turn to the variations in the head and pre-head – the secondary tones 
in the pretonic segment. Th e simplest kind of variation is to change the general 
pitch level of the head to either higher than normal, or to lower:

180
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
 
11.9 i 
they re coming on \Monday |
 
 ii 
–they re coming on \Monday |
 
 iii 
–they re coming on \Monday |
 
 Th e second rendering, ii above, has a high level head and sounds more ‘insist-
ent’. Th e third, iii, with a low level head, means given information, i.e. infor-
mation treated as already known by the addressee, before a narrow focus (see 
p. 152). Th e system is then:
 
 unmarked 
neutral
 
      –so . . . 
intense
 
      –so . . . 
given
 
 Instead of remaining level, the pitch may descend gradually through the head, 
a so-called ‘falling head’, or it may ascend, a ‘rising head’. Such a movement 
adds an element of ‘warmth’; that ‘warmth’ is combined with a sense of author-
ity if the movement is downwards, and with a sense of appeal if it is upwards. 
Compare:
 
11.10 i 
they ll ↘ all be coming on \Monday | (i.e. ‘I can assure you’)
 
 ii they ll ↗ all be coming on \Monday | (i.e. ‘I appeal to you; believe me’)
 
 (Note that the arrow accents appear in the head; they do not accompany the 
tonic.)
 
 Instead of a relatively smooth descent or ascent, the movement can ‘step’ grad-
ually downwards or upwards; this so-called ‘stepping head’ adds a sense of 
emphasis combined with either authority or appeal:
 
 iii they ll ↘ all be ↓coming on \Monday | (i.e. ‘I emphatically assure you’)
 
 iv they ll ↗ all be ↑coming on \Monday | (i.e. ‘I strongly appeal to you; believe 
me’)
 
 Instead of a general movement downwards or upwards in the head, there may 
be a series of movements; this so-called ‘glissando head’ adds forcefulness:
 
 v they ll ↘ all be ↘ coming on \Monday | (i.e. ‘I have told you many times’)
 
 vi they ll ↗ all be ↗ coming on \Monday | (i.e. ‘I have told you many times; I beg 
you to believe me’)
 
 If there is no head, but just a pre-head, a limited system can operate:
 
11.11 i the po\lice | (neutral, as if announcing a heading or sub-heading in a talk)
 
 ii –the po\lice | (intense)
 
 Th e full secondary tone system for the pretonic segment is as follows:
 
 so 
neutral 
(unmarked)
  
 
–so . . . 
high level 
‘intense’
 
 
–so . . . 
low level 
given
  
 ↘ so . . . 
falling 
warm, with authority
 
 ↗ so . . . 
rising 
warm, with appeal

CHAPTER 11
Intonation: secondary tone
 
 ↘ so ↓so . . .

 ↗ so ↑so . . . 
stepping up 
emphatic, with appeal
 
 ↘ so ↘ so . . . 
glissando down 
forceful, with authority
 
 ↗ so ↗ so . . . 
glissando up 
forceful, with appeal
 
 It must, of course, be understood that there may be more than two stressed 
syllables in the head, thus, for instance: ↘ ↓ ↓, or ↗ ↗ ↗ ↗ , etc.
It must also be understood that neutral and secondary pretonics can combine 
with any primary or secondary tones in the tonic segment, allowing, theoreti-
cally, for a vast number of combinations; but there are certain  combinations 
that are more frequent than others. Listen to these:
 
11.12 if they re ↘ all going to come on /Monday  
(warm, incomplete)
 
 ↗ how are we going to \sleep them 
(warm, with appeal)
 
 they ll ↘ have to ↓bring at ↓least a Vcamping bed  (emphatic, with implication)
 
 I just ↗ hope they ve ↑still \got it 
 (emphatic, with appeal, i.e. 
need to fi nd out)
 
 well I ↘ hope they ↘ have nt got Vrid of it 
(forceful, with implication)
 
 do you ↗ think we can ↗ ask them to /bring it 
 (forceful, with appeal, i.e. to 
agree to the question)
 
 Now try your directing expertise on the Pygmalion passage, and edit the 
 transcription you did on pp. 173–4.
 
 
*
 
 Very little practice material seems to exist for secondary tones, apart from 
Brazil (1994) and Cauldwell (2003) on the mid level tone.

12 Intonation: paratones
 
Paratones
 
 Spoken discourse exhibits the kinds of structure that written discourse is seen 
to have: sentences, paragraphs, sections and sub-sections, chapters and the 
sense of a whole ‘document’ or book. A paragraph is something written; the 
equivalent in speech has been termed a ‘paratone’ – a phonological paragraph. 
Paratones tend to be shorter than paragraphs and may oft en be more equiva-
lent to extended sentences. Paratones also extend over sequences of speaker 
turns in conversations.
Just as paragraphs are used for new topics, shift s in temporal sequence or 
episodic events, we use paratones for similar purposes. A very clear example is 
the reading of the news: each new topic is distinguished from a previous one 
by intonation – the newsreader normally indicates that they are introducing a 
new news item simply by a change in intonation. Narratives, whether scripted 
or spontaneous, are structured intonationally in similar ways. It may be rather 
more diffi  cult to perceive such structure in casual, informal conversation 
because of the way it is composed, but structures are there nevertheless. Th e 
key to these phonological paragraphs – paratones – have been listed as follows:
1. a high pitch on the onset syllable of the initial intonation unit in the 
paratone;
2. a relatively high ‘baseline’ for that initial unit; this means that the low 
pitches are relatively high, compared to the low pitches in the fi nal unit of 
the paratone;
3. there is a gradual lowering – or ‘declination’ – of the baseline as the 
paratone progresses until the fi nal unit is reached;
4. the depth of the fall in the fi nal unit is the lowest in the whole paratone;
5. there is usually a slowing down process in the fi nal unit, so-called ‘pre-
boundary lengthening’; and
6. there is usually a longer pause than is normally allowed between 
intonation units within a paratone.
 
 Listen now again to Dangerous childhood pranks 1 and see if you can hear 
paratone boundaries; mark them with a double upright: ||. As we have noted 
before, not all features need to be present for signalling an item in intonation, 
but listen especially for a low ‘baseline’ pitch, a pause and a relatively high pitch 
in the following unit in lines 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 16 and 17.

*
 
 Declination, the gradual descent of the baseline from the initial intonation 
unit in a paratone to the fi nal unit, is an eff ective way of indicating that the 
units do in fact belong to each other, and could be regarded as the neutral 
form. But the declination could be interrupted; and this is a decision by the 
speaker. Th e speaker might decide to halt the declination by raising the pitch 
of the onset of the following unit, or by dropping it to a lower than expected 
level.
If the speaker raises the baseline in the course of a paratone, instead of 
allowing it to descend gradually, it usually means that they are introducing 
a piece of information that is contrary to what might have been otherwise 
expected; in some way, the information is deemed to be contrastive. Examples 
occur in Dangerous childhood pranks 1 line 13. Th e speaker initiates a para-
tone at line 10 and does not seem to fi nish it until line 15 with a ‘deep’ fall 
on times. But in the course of this paratone, he raises the baseline twice, on . 
and fi red it and . in the shed. He realizes that people would not expect them 
to fi re the gun, and especially not in such a small shed; hence the ‘contrastive’ 
nature of the information. We could transcribe this raising of the baseline as 
follows: -
• - . and ˋfi red - . in the ˋshed |
 
 If the speaker maintains the pitch level of the baseline, instead of allowing 
it to descend gradually, it usually means that they are introducing a piece of 
 information that is equivalent to the information that they have just supplied. 

184
PART TWO
. . . and Discourse
Listen, for example, to lines 5 and 6; the baseline of and he found it is main-
tained in and they were thirty eight, indicating that the speaker regards the 
second piece of information as equivalent to the previous piece. We could 
transcribe this maintaining of the baseline as 0:
• | . and he found it 0 and they were thirty \eight ||
 
 Finally, if the speaker dropped the pitch level of the onset syllable and the base-
line to a lower level than expected, it usually means that the speaker either 
wishes to indicate that the next piece of information is fully expected, or that 
the next piece of information should be regarded as a parenthesis. Listen, for 
example, fi rstly to line 3, where the speaker corrects himself with no it wasn’t, 
as a parenthesis, on a lower than otherwise expected pitch level and then pro-
vides the corrected information about Rick Holmans’s shed; and then listen, 
secondly, to line 9 where mention is made again of Rick Holmans’s shed, and 
because that information is fully known, it is pitched on a lower than expected 
level. We can transcribe this dropping of the baseline as 2:
• || . \Benny’s 2 no it \wasn t |
• | . in a \shed 2 in a . um Rick \Holmans’s shed ||
 
 You will be able to fi nd similar examples in Dangerous childhood pranks 2, 
but there are two particularly interesting examples in lines 14 and 15. Th ere 
the speaker reports direct speech, and does so with a raised baseline. His 
words and said and we said are pitched low as pre-heads – although said is a 
lexical item, it is certainly not stressed – and then the direct speech is pitched 
on a higher than expected baseline within the intonation unit. One possi-
ble way of transcribing this is to enclose the ‘raised baseline’ symbol within 
brackets, (-):
• | and said . (-) is it o k to /dive | we said (-) \yes ||
 
 Th at leads to a consideration of another change in intonation patterns taking 
place in UK at present (one change was mentioned on p. 164). Th ere is a 
relatively new pattern that has been oft en referred to as the ‘high rising termi-
nal’ (‘HRT’); a better term is a ‘raised rise’. A person can be telling a story, a 
joke or some kind of narrative, and check whether the addressee has under-
stood the signifi cance of a particular piece of information. Th ey provide the 
addressee with new information, in a declarative clause, but at the same time, 
ask whether they realize the signifi cance of it; in other words, they are, at that 
moment, doing two things at the same: telling and asking. Th is is accom-
plished by retaining the declarative mood, choosing a rising tone, but choos-
ing also a higher baseline – as in the above case of introducing direct speech. 
Listen to this description of a speaker’s visit to a craft  fair in Cambridge, espe-
cially for the instance of a raised rise where the speaker seems to be telling her 
addresses something new, but checking at the same time if they know what 
she means:

185
CHAPTER 12
Intonation: paratones
 
12.1 Cambridge craft  fair
 
 oh what did I see what did I see . stained glass – there was I went  
1
 
 to a craft  fair – – um in Cambridge . and um . I know – I went  
2
 
 to a craft  fair in Cambridge and they had . um this stained glass stall  
3
 
 . and it was all mobiles . made out of stained glass – and they were  
4
 
 superb they were . and mirrors . with all diff erent colours . like going  
5
 
 round in . the colour . colour wheel – but all diff erent sized bits of  
6
 
 coloured glass on it  
7
 
 In lines 5 and 6, she talks about coloured mirrors that go round in a colour 
wheel; going round in the colour wheel is new information, but she seems to 
want to check with her addressees at the same time that they know what a 
colour wheel is. (A colour wheel, apparently, is a circular chart used by artists, 
which shows the relationship between the diff erent colours in the spectrum; it 
is a compound noun.)
Th is is a very clever innovation. It provides new information in a declara-
tive clause; it asks a question with a rising tone; it interrupts the course of the 
pitch movement in the intonation unit by introducing a raised baseline, like 
the direct speech above. It is diff erent from the declarative with a rising tone 
described on p. 167 as a challenge. Challenges refer back immediately as a 
response to what has just been said; and there is no raising of the baseline. But 
statement-verifi cations of this kind do not refer back to previous information; 
they contribute new information in the development of the discourse. We can 
transcribe lines 5 and 6 as follows:
• 
\mirrors | . with all diff erent \colours | . like going round in . the colour . 
(-)/colour wheel |
 
 You can attempt the transcription of the tonality, tonicity and tone of the rest 
of this little monologue.
 
Calling
 
 Th ere is just one other pattern of intonation that needs to be mentioned. 
Sometimes we need to call out a short message over a distance, like Dinner’s 
ready! Th ere is a special kind of pattern for this kind of calling. Th ey are very 
short paratones, consisting of a single intonation unit with a two-level tone: 
high level and then mid level, which is maintained through the tail. If there is 
no tail, the two-level tone may even distort the tonic syllable by prolonging it, 
to make time for the change in pitch. Listen to these callings:
 
12.2 
–dinner s –ready || come and –get –it || it s on the –tab–le || come –o–on ||
 
 Th e usual features of paratone boundaries do not seem to apply in the case of 
calling. Callings do, of course, come singly as well as in sequences as above! 
Listen to this one!
