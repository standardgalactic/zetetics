Foreword
Machine learning is the latest in a long line of attempts to distill human
knowledge and reasoning into a form that is suitable for constructing ma-
chines and engineering automated systems. As machine learning becomes
more ubiquitous and its software packages become easier to use, it is nat-
ural and desirable that the low-level technical details are abstracted away
and hidden from the practitioner. However, this brings with it the danger
that a practitioner becomes unaware of the design decisions and, hence,
the limits of machine learning algorithms.
The enthusiastic practitioner who is interested to learn more about the
magic behind successful machine learning algorithms currently faces a
daunting set of pre-requisite knowledge:
Programming languages and data analysis tools
Large-scale computation and the associated frameworks
Mathematics and statistics and how machine learning builds on it
At universities, introductory courses on machine learning tend to spend
early parts of the course covering some of these pre-requisites. For histori-
cal reasons, courses in machine learning tend to be taught in the computer
science department, where students are often trained in the ﬁrst two areas
of knowledge, but not so much in mathematics and statistics.
Current machine learning textbooks primarily focus on machine learn-
ing algorithms and methodologies and assume that the reader is com-
petent in mathematics and statistics. Therefore, these books only spend
one or two chapters on background mathematics, either at the beginning
of the book or as appendices. We have found many people who want to
delve into the foundations of basic machine learning methods who strug-
gle with the mathematical knowledge required to read a machine learning
textbook. Having taught undergraduate and graduate courses at universi-
ties, we ﬁnd that the gap between high school mathematics and the math-
ematics level required to read a standard machine learning textbook is too
big for many people.
This book brings the mathematical foundations of basic machine learn-
ing concepts to the fore and collects the information in a single place so
that this skills gap is narrowed or even closed.

Foreword
Why Another Book on Machine Learning?
Machine learning builds upon the language of mathematics to express
concepts that seem intuitively obvious but that are surprisingly difﬁcult
to formalize. Once formalized properly, we can gain insights into the task
we want to solve. One common complaint of students of mathematics
around the globe is that the topics covered seem to have little relevance
to practical problems. We believe that machine learning is an obvious and
direct motivation for people to learn mathematics.
This book is intended to be a guidebook to the vast mathematical lit-
erature that forms the foundations of modern machine learning. We mo-
“Math is linked in
the popular mind
with phobia and
anxiety. You’d think
we’re discussing
spiders.” (Strogatz,
2014, page 281)
tivate the need for mathematical concepts by directly pointing out their
usefulness in the context of fundamental machine learning problems. In
the interest of keeping the book short, many details and more advanced
concepts have been left out. Equipped with the basic concepts presented
here, and how they ﬁt into the larger context of machine learning, the
reader can ﬁnd numerous resources for further study, which we provide at
the end of the respective chapters. For readers with a mathematical back-
ground, this book provides a brief but precisely stated glimpse of machine
learning. In contrast to other books that focus on methods and models
of machine learning (MacKay, 2003; Bishop, 2006; Alpaydin, 2010; Bar-
ber, 2012; Murphy, 2012; Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014; Rogers
and Girolami, 2016) or programmatic aspects of machine learning (M¨uller
and Guido, 2016; Raschka and Mirjalili, 2017; Chollet and Allaire, 2018),
we provide only four representative examples of machine learning algo-
rithms. Instead, we focus on the mathematical concepts behind the models
themselves. We hope that readers will be able to gain a deeper understand-
ing of the basic questions in machine learning and connect practical ques-
tions arising from the use of machine learning with fundamental choices
in the mathematical model.
We do not aim to write a classical machine learning book. Instead, our
intention is to provide the mathematical background, applied to four cen-
tral machine learning problems, to make it easier to read other machine
learning textbooks.
Who Is the Target Audience?
As applications of machine learning become widespread in society, we
believe that everybody should have some understanding of its underlying
principles. This book is written in an academic mathematical style, which
enables us to be precise about the concepts behind machine learning. We
encourage readers unfamiliar with this seemingly terse style to persevere
and to keep the goals of each topic in mind. We sprinkle comments and
remarks throughout the text, in the hope that it provides useful guidance
with respect to the big picture.
The book assumes the reader to have mathematical knowledge commonly

covered in high school mathematics and physics. For example, the reader
should have seen derivatives and integrals before, and geometric vectors
in two or three dimensions. Starting from there, we generalize these con-
cepts. Therefore, the target audience of the book includes undergraduate
university students, evening learners and learners participating in online
machine learning courses.
In analogy to music, there are three types of interaction that people
have with machine learning:
Astute Listener
The democratization of machine learning by the pro-
vision of open-source software, online tutorials and cloud-based tools al-
lows users to not worry about the speciﬁcs of pipelines. Users can focus on
extracting insights from data using off-the-shelf tools. This enables non-
tech-savvy domain experts to beneﬁt from machine learning. This is sim-
ilar to listening to music; the user is able to choose and discern between
different types of machine learning, and beneﬁts from it. More experi-
enced users are like music critics, asking important questions about the
application of machine learning in society such as ethics, fairness, and pri-
vacy of the individual. We hope that this book provides a foundation for
thinking about the certiﬁcation and risk management of machine learning
systems, and allows them to use their domain expertise to build better
machine learning systems.
Experienced Artist
Skilled practitioners of machine learning can plug
and play different tools and libraries into an analysis pipeline. The stereo-
typical practitioner would be a data scientist or engineer who understands
machine learning interfaces and their use cases, and is able to perform
wonderful feats of prediction from data. This is similar to a virtuoso play-
ing music, where highly skilled practitioners can bring existing instru-
ments to life and bring enjoyment to their audience. Using the mathe-
matics presented here as a primer, practitioners would be able to under-
stand the beneﬁts and limits of their favorite method, and to extend and
generalize existing machine learning algorithms. We hope that this book
provides the impetus for more rigorous and principled development of
machine learning methods.
Fledgling Composer
As machine learning is applied to new domains,
developers of machine learning need to develop new methods and extend
existing algorithms. They are often researchers who need to understand
the mathematical basis of machine learning and uncover relationships be-
tween different tasks. This is similar to composers of music who, within
the rules and structure of musical theory, create new and amazing pieces.
We hope this book provides a high-level overview of other technical books
for people who want to become composers of machine learning. There is
a great need in society for new researchers who are able to propose and
explore novel approaches for attacking the many challenges of learning
from data.

Introduction and Motivation
Machine learning is about designing algorithms that automatically extract
valuable information from data. The emphasis here is on “automatic”, i.e.,
machine learning is concerned about general-purpose methodologies that
can be applied to many datasets, while producing something that is mean-
ingful. There are three concepts that are at the core of machine learning:
data, a model, and learning.
Since machine learning is inherently data driven, data is at the core
data
of machine learning. The goal of machine learning is to design general-
purpose methodologies to extract valuable patterns from data, ideally
without much domain-speciﬁc expertise. For example, given a large corpus
of documents (e.g., books in many libraries), machine learning methods
can be used to automatically ﬁnd relevant topics that are shared across
documents (Hoffman et al., 2010). To achieve this goal, we design mod-
els that are typically related to the process that generates data, similar to
model
the dataset we are given. For example, in a regression setting, the model
would describe a function that maps inputs to real-valued outputs. To
paraphrase Mitchell (1997): A model is said to learn from data if its per-
formance on a given task improves after the data is taken into account.
The goal is to ﬁnd good models that generalize well to yet unseen data,
which we may care about in the future. Learning can be understood as a
learning
way to automatically ﬁnd patterns and structure in data by optimizing the
parameters of the model.
While machine learning has seen many success stories, and software is
readily available to design and train rich and ﬂexible machine learning
systems, we believe that the mathematical foundations of machine learn-
ing are important in order to understand fundamental principles upon
which more complicated machine learning systems are built. Understand-
ing these principles can facilitate creating new machine learning solutions,
understanding and debugging existing approaches, and learning about the
inherent assumptions and limitations of the methodologies we are work-
ing with.

Introduction and Motivation
1.1 Finding Words for Intuitions
A challenge we face regularly in machine learning is that concepts and
words are slippery, and a particular component of the machine learning
system can be abstracted to different mathematical concepts. For example,
the word “algorithm” is used in at least two different senses in the con-
text of machine learning. In the ﬁrst sense, we use the phrase “machine
learning algorithm” to mean a system that makes predictions based on in-
put data. We refer to these algorithms as predictors. In the second sense,
predictor
we use the exact same phrase “machine learning algorithm” to mean a
system that adapts some internal parameters of the predictor so that it
performs well on future unseen input data. Here we refer to this adapta-
tion as training a system.
training
This book will not resolve the issue of ambiguity, but we want to high-
light upfront that, depending on the context, the same expressions can
mean different things. However, we attempt to make the context sufﬁ-
ciently clear to reduce the level of ambiguity.
The ﬁrst part of this book introduces the mathematical concepts and
foundations needed to talk about the three main components of a machine
learning system: data, models, and learning. We will brieﬂy outline these
components here, and we will revisit them again in Chapter 8 once we
have discussed the necessary mathematical concepts.
While not all data is numerical, it is often useful to consider data in
a number format. In this book, we assume that data has already been
appropriately converted into a numerical representation suitable for read-
ing into a computer program. Therefore, we think of data as vectors. As
data as vectors
another illustration of how subtle words are, there are (at least) three
different ways to think about vectors: a vector as an array of numbers (a
computer science view), a vector as an arrow with a direction and magni-
tude (a physics view), and a vector as an object that obeys addition and
scaling (a mathematical view).
A model is typically used to describe a process for generating data, sim-
model
ilar to the dataset at hand. Therefore, good models can also be thought
of as simpliﬁed versions of the real (unknown) data-generating process,
capturing aspects that are relevant for modeling the data and extracting
hidden patterns from it. A good model can then be used to predict what
would happen in the real world without performing real-world experi-
ments.
We now come to the crux of the matter, the learning component of
learning
machine learning. Assume we are given a dataset and a suitable model.
Training the model means to use the data available to optimize some pa-
rameters of the model with respect to a utility function that evaluates how
well the model predicts the training data. Most training methods can be
thought of as an approach analogous to climbing a hill to reach its peak.
In this analogy, the peak of the hill corresponds to a maximum of some

1.2 Two Ways to Read This Book

desired performance measure. However, in practice, we are interested in
the model to perform well on unseen data. Performing well on data that
we have already seen (training data) may only mean that we found a
good way to memorize the data. However, this may not generalize well to
unseen data, and, in practical applications, we often need to expose our
machine learning system to situations that it has not encountered before.
Let us summarize the main concepts of machine learning that we cover
in this book:
We represent data as vectors.
We choose an appropriate model, either using the probabilistic or opti-
mization view.
We learn from available data by using numerical optimization methods
with the aim that the model performs well on data not used for training.
1.2 Two Ways to Read This Book
We can consider two strategies for understanding the mathematics for
machine learning:
Bottom-up: Building up the concepts from foundational to more ad-
vanced. This is often the preferred approach in more technical ﬁelds,
such as mathematics. This strategy has the advantage that the reader
at all times is able to rely on their previously learned concepts. Unfor-
tunately, for a practitioner many of the foundational concepts are not
particularly interesting by themselves, and the lack of motivation means
that most foundational deﬁnitions are quickly forgotten.
Top-down: Drilling down from practical needs to more basic require-
ments. This goal-driven approach has the advantage that the readers
know at all times why they need to work on a particular concept, and
there is a clear path of required knowledge. The downside of this strat-
egy is that the knowledge is built on potentially shaky foundations, and
the readers have to remember a set of words that they do not have any
way of understanding.
We decided to write this book in a modular way to separate foundational
(mathematical) concepts from applications so that this book can be read
in both ways. The book is split into two parts, where Part I lays the math-
ematical foundations and Part II applies the concepts from Part I to a set
of fundamental machine learning problems, which form four pillars of
machine learning as illustrated in Figure 1.1: regression, dimensionality
reduction, density estimation, and classiﬁcation. Chapters in Part I mostly
build upon the previous ones, but it is possible to skip a chapter and work
backward if necessary. Chapters in Part II are only loosely coupled and
can be read in any order. There are many pointers forward and backward

between the two parts of the book to link mathematical concepts with
machine learning algorithms.
Of course there are more than two ways to read this book. Most readers
learn using a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, some-
times building up basic mathematical skills before attempting more com-
plex concepts, but also choosing topics based on applications of machine
learning.
Part I Is about Mathematics
The four pillars of machine learning we cover in this book (see Figure 1.1)
require a solid mathematical foundation, which is laid out in Part I.
We represent numerical data as vectors and represent a table of such
data as a matrix. The study of vectors and matrices is called linear algebra,
which we introduce in Chapter 2. The collection of vectors as a matrix is
linear algebra
also described there.
Given two vectors representing two objects in the real world, we want
to make statements about their similarity. The idea is that vectors that
are similar should be predicted to have similar outputs by our machine
learning algorithm (our predictor). To formalize the idea of similarity be-
tween vectors, we need to introduce operations that take two vectors as
input and return a numerical value representing their similarity. The con-
struction of similarity and distances is central to analytic geometry and is
analytic geometry
discussed in Chapter 3.
In Chapter 4, we introduce some fundamental concepts about matri-
ces and matrix decomposition. Some operations on matrices are extremely

useful in machine learning, and they allow for an intuitive interpretation
of the data and more efﬁcient learning.
We often consider data to be noisy observations of some true underly-
ing signal. We hope that by applying machine learning we can identify the
signal from the noise. This requires us to have a language for quantify-
ing what “noise” means. We often would also like to have predictors that

allow us to express some sort of uncertainty, e.g., to quantify the conﬁ-
dence we have about the value of the prediction at a particular test data
point. Quantiﬁcation of uncertainty is the realm of probability theory and
probability theory
is covered in Chapter 6.
To train machine learning models, we typically ﬁnd parameters that
maximize some performance measure. Many optimization techniques re-
quire the concept of a gradient, which tells us the direction in which to
search for a solution. Chapter 5 is about vector calculus and details the
vector calculus
concept of gradients, which we subsequently use in Chapter 7, where we
talk about optimization to ﬁnd maxima/minima of functions.
optimization
Part II Is about Machine Learning
The second part of the book introduces four pillars of machine learning
as shown in Figure 1.1. We illustrate how the mathematical concepts in-
troduced in the ﬁrst part of the book are the foundation for each pillar.
Broadly speaking, chapters are ordered by difﬁculty (in ascending order).
In Chapter 8, we restate the three components of machine learning
(data, models, and parameter estimation) in a mathematical fashion. In
addition, we provide some guidelines for building experimental set-ups
that guard against overly optimistic evaluations of machine learning sys-
tems. Recall that the goal is to build a predictor that performs well on
unseen data.
In Chapter 9, we will have a close look at linear regression, where our
linear regression
objective is to ﬁnd functions that map inputs x ∈RD to corresponding ob-
served function values y ∈R, which we can interpret as the labels of their
respective inputs. We will discuss classical model ﬁtting (parameter esti-
mation) via maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimation,
as well as Bayesian linear regression, where we integrate the parameters
out instead of optimizing them.
Chapter 10 focuses on dimensionality reduction, the second pillar in Fig-
dimensionality
reduction
ure 1.1, using principal component analysis. The key objective of dimen-
sionality reduction is to ﬁnd a compact, lower-dimensional representation
of high-dimensional data x ∈RD, which is often easier to analyze than
the original data. Unlike regression, dimensionality reduction is only con-
cerned about modeling the data – there are no labels associated with a
data point x.
In Chapter 11, we will move to our third pillar: density estimation. The
density estimation
objective of density estimation is to ﬁnd a probability distribution that de-
scribes a given dataset. We will focus on Gaussian mixture models for this
purpose, and we will discuss an iterative scheme to ﬁnd the parameters of
this model. As in dimensionality reduction, there are no labels associated
with the data points x ∈RD. However, we do not seek a low-dimensional
representation of the data. Instead, we are interested in a density model
that describes the data.
Chapter 12 concludes the book with an in-depth discussion of the fourth

pillar: classiﬁcation. We will discuss classiﬁcation in the context of support
classiﬁcation
vector machines. Similar to regression (Chapter 9), we have inputs x and
corresponding labels y. However, unlike regression, where the labels were
real-valued, the labels in classiﬁcation are integers, which requires special
care.

paper. For Part II, we provide programming tutorials (jupyter notebooks)

Linear Algebra
When formalizing intuitive concepts, a common approach is to construct a
set of objects (symbols) and a set of rules to manipulate these objects. This
is known as an algebra. Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain
algebra
rules to manipulate vectors. The vectors many of us know from school are
called “geometric vectors”, which are usually denoted by a small arrow
above the letter, e.g., −→x and −→y . In this book, we discuss more general
concepts of vectors and use a bold letter to represent them, e.g., x and y.
In general, vectors are special objects that can be added together and
multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind. From
an abstract mathematical viewpoint, any object that satisﬁes these two
properties can be considered a vector. Here are some examples of such
vector objects:
1. Geometric vectors. This example of a vector may be familiar from high
school mathematics and physics. Geometric vectors – see Figure 2.1(a)
– are directed segments, which can be drawn (at least in two dimen-
sions). Two geometric vectors
→x,
→y can be added, such that
→x+
→y =
→z
is another geometric vector. Furthermore, multiplication by a scalar
λ
→x, λ ∈R, is also a geometric vector. In fact, it is the original vector
scaled by λ. Therefore, geometric vectors are instances of the vector
concepts introduced previously. Interpreting vectors as geometric vec-
tors enables us to use our intuitions about direction and magnitude to
reason about mathematical operations.
2. Polynomials are also vectors; see Figure 2.1(b): Two polynomials can

be added together, which results in another polynomial; and they can
be multiplied by a scalar λ ∈R, and the result is a polynomial as
well. Therefore, polynomials are (rather unusual) instances of vectors.
Note that polynomials are very different from geometric vectors. While
geometric vectors are concrete “drawings”, polynomials are abstract
concepts. However, they are both vectors in the sense previously de-
scribed.
3. Audio signals are vectors. Audio signals are represented as a series of
numbers. We can add audio signals together, and their sum is a new
audio signal. If we scale an audio signal, we also obtain an audio signal.
Therefore, audio signals are a type of vector, too.
4. Elements of Rn (tuples of n real numbers) are vectors. Rn is more
abstract than polynomials, and it is the concept we focus on in this
book. For instance,
a =



is an example of a triplet of numbers. Adding two vectors a, b ∈Rn
component-wise results in another vector: a + b = c ∈Rn. Moreover,
multiplying a ∈Rn by λ ∈R results in a scaled vector λa ∈Rn.
Considering vectors as elements of Rn has an additional beneﬁt that

it loosely corresponds to arrays of real numbers on a computer. Many
programming languages support array operations, which allow for con-
venient implementation of algorithms that involve vector operations.
Linear algebra focuses on the similarities between these vector concepts.
We can add them together and multiply them by scalars. We will largely

focus on vectors in Rn since most algorithms in linear algebra are for-
mulated in Rn. We will see in Chapter 8 that we often consider data to
be represented as vectors in Rn. In this book, we will focus on ﬁnite-
dimensional vector spaces, in which case there is a 1:1 correspondence
between any kind of vector and Rn. When it is convenient, we will use
intuitions about geometric vectors and consider array-based algorithms.
One major idea in mathematics is the idea of “closure”. This is the ques-
tion: What is the set of all things that can result from my proposed oper-
ations? In the case of vectors: What is the set of vectors that can result by
starting with a small set of vectors, and adding them to each other and
scaling them? This results in a vector space (Section 2.4). The concept of
a vector space and its properties underlie much of machine learning. The
concepts introduced in this chapter are summarized in Figure 2.2.
This chapter is mostly based on the lecture notes and books by Drumm
and Weil (2001), Strang (2003), Hogben (2013), Liesen and Mehrmann

Linear algebra plays an important role in machine learning and gen-
eral mathematics. The concepts introduced in this chapter are further ex-
panded to include the idea of geometry in Chapter 3. In Chapter 5, we
will discuss vector calculus, where a principled knowledge of matrix op-
erations is essential. In Chapter 10, we will use projections (to be intro-
duced in Section 3.8) for dimensionality reduction with principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA). In Chapter 9, we will discuss linear regression, where
linear algebra plays a central role for solving least-squares problems.
2.1 Systems of Linear Equations
Systems of linear equations play a central part of linear algebra. Many
problems can be formulated as systems of linear equations, and linear
algebra gives us the tools for solving them.

R1, . . . , Rm are required. To produce a unit of product Nj, aij units of
resource Ri are needed, where i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , n.
The objective is to ﬁnd an optimal production plan, i.e., a plan of how
many units xj of product Nj should be produced if a total of bi units of
resource Ri are available and (ideally) no resources are left over.
If we produce x1, . . . , xn units of the corresponding products, we need

many units of resource Ri. An optimal production plan (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn,
therefore, has to satisfy the following system of equations:
a11x1 + · · · + a1nxn = b1
...
am1x1 + · · · + amnxn = bm

where aij ∈R and bi ∈R.

From the ﬁrst and third equation, it follows that x1 = 1. From (1)+(2),
we get 2x1 + 3x3 = 5, i.e., x3 = 1. From (3), we then get that x2 = 1.
Therefore, (1, 1, 1) is the only possible and unique solution (verify that
(1, 1, 1) is a solution by plugging in).

is a solution of the system of linear equations, i.e., we obtain a solution
set that contains inﬁnitely many solutions.
In general, for a real-valued system of linear equations we obtain either
no, exactly one, or inﬁnitely many solutions. Linear regression (Chapter 9)
solves a version of Example 2.1 when we cannot solve the system of linear
equations.
Remark (Geometric Interpretation of Systems of Linear Equations). In a
system of linear equations with two variables x1, x2, each linear equation
deﬁnes a line on the x1x2-plane. Since a solution to a system of linear
equations must satisfy all equations simultaneously, the solution set is the
intersection of these lines. This intersection set can be a line (if the linear
equations describe the same line), a point, or empty (when the lines are
parallel). An illustration is given in Figure 2.3 for the system
4x1 + 4x2 = 5
2x1 −4x2 = 1
(2.8)
where the solution space is the point (x1, x2) = (1, 1
4). Similarly, for three
variables, each linear equation determines a plane in three-dimensional
space. When we intersect these planes, i.e., satisfy all linear equations at
the same time, we can obtain a solution set that is a plane, a line, a point
or empty (when the planes have no common intersection).
♦
For a systematic approach to solving systems of linear equations, we
will introduce a useful compact notation. We collect the coefﬁcients aij
into vectors and collect the vectors into matrices. In other words, we write
the system from (2.3) in the following form:

In the following, we will have a close look at these matrices and de-
ﬁne computation rules. We will return to solving linear equations in Sec-
tion 2.3.
2.2 Matrices
Matrices play a central role in linear algebra. They can be used to com-
pactly represent systems of linear equations, but they also represent linear
functions (linear mappings) as we will see later in Section 2.7. Before we
discuss some of these interesting topics, let us ﬁrst deﬁne what a matrix
is and what kind of operations we can do with matrices. We will see more
properties of matrices in Chapter 4.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Matrix). With m, n ∈N a real-valued (m, n) matrix A is
matrix
an m·n-tuple of elements aij, i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n, which is ordered
according to a rectangular scheme consisting of m rows and n columns:

row
columns. These special matrices are also called row/column vectors.

Rm×n is the set of all real-valued (m, n)-matrices. A ∈Rm×n can be
equivalently represented as a ∈Rmn by stacking all n columns of the
matrix into a long vector; see Figure 2.4.
2.2.1 Matrix Addition and Multiplication
The sum of two matrices A ∈Rm×n, B ∈Rm×n is deﬁned as the element-

row of A with the jth column of B and sum them up. Later in Section 3.2,
we will call this the dot product of the corresponding row and column. In
cases, where we need to be explicit that we are performing multiplication,
we use the notation A · B to denote multiplication (explicitly showing
“·”).
Remark. Matrices can only be multiplied if their “neighboring” dimensions
match. For instance, an n × k-matrix A can be multiplied with a k × m-
matrix B, but only from the left side:
A

The product BA is not deﬁned if m ̸= n since the neighboring dimensions
do not match.

Remark. Matrix multiplication is not deﬁned as an element-wise operation
on matrix elements, i.e., cij ̸= aijbij (even if the size of A, B was cho-
sen appropriately). This kind of element-wise multiplication often appears
in programming languages when we multiply (multi-dimensional) arrays
with each other, and is called a Hadamard product.

bij = aji is called the transpose of A. We write B = A⊤.

The main diagonal
(sometimes called
“principal diagonal”,
“primary diagonal”,
“leading diagonal”,
or “major diagonal”)
of a matrix A is the
collection of entries
Aij where i = j.
In general, A⊤can be obtained by writing the columns of A as the rows
of A⊤. The following are important properties of inverses and transposes:

Deﬁnition 2.5 (Symmetric Matrix). A matrix A ∈Rn×n is symmetric if

A = A⊤.
Note that only (n, n)-matrices can be symmetric. Generally, we call
(n, n)-matrices also square matrices because they possess the same num-
square matrix
ber of rows and columns. Moreover, if A is invertible, then so is A⊤, and
(A−1)⊤= (A⊤)−1 =: A−⊤.
Remark (Sum and Product of Symmetric Matrices). The sum of symmet-
ric matrices A, B ∈Rn×n is always symmetric. However, although their
product is always deﬁned, it is generally not symmetric:

2.2.3 Multiplication by a Scalar
Let us look at what happens to matrices when they are multiplied by a
scalar λ ∈R. Let A ∈Rm×n and λ ∈R. Then λA = K, Kij = λ aij.
Practically, λ scales each element of A. For λ, ψ ∈R, the following holds:

Associativity:

λ(BC) = (λB)C = B(λC) = (BC)λ,

Note that this allows us to move scalar values around.
(λC)⊤= C⊤λ⊤= C⊤λ = λC⊤since λ = λ⊤for all λ ∈R.

2.2.4 Compact Representations of Systems of Linear Equations
If we consider the system of linear equations
2x1 + 3x2 + 5x3 = 1
4x1 −2x2 −7x3 = 8
9x1 + 5x2 −3x3 = 2
(2.35)
and use the rules for matrix multiplication, we can write this equation
system in a more compact form as

Note that x1 scales the ﬁrst column, x2 the second one, and x3 the third
one.
Generally, a system of linear equations can be compactly represented in
their matrix form as Ax = b; see (2.3), and the product Ax is a (linear)
combination of the columns of A. We will discuss linear combinations in
more detail in Section 2.5.

2.3 Solving Systems of Linear Equations

2.3 Solving Systems of Linear Equations
In (2.3), we introduced the general form of an equation system, i.e.,
a11x1 + · · · + a1nxn = b1
...
am1x1 + · · · + amnxn = bm ,
(2.37)
where aij ∈R and bi ∈R are known constants and xj are unknowns,
i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n. Thus far, we saw that matrices can be used as
a compact way of formulating systems of linear equations so that we can
write Ax = b, see (2.10). Moreover, we deﬁned basic matrix operations,
such as addition and multiplication of matrices. In the following, we will
focus on solving systems of linear equations and provide an algorithm for
ﬁnding the inverse of a matrix.
2.3.1 Particular and General Solution
Before discussing how to generally solve systems of linear equations, let
us have a look at an example. Consider the system of equations

(2.38)
The system has two equations and four unknowns. Therefore, in general
we would expect inﬁnitely many solutions. This system of equations is
in a particularly easy form, where the ﬁrst two columns consist of a 1
and a 0. Remember that we want to ﬁnd scalars x1, . . . , x4, such that
P4
i=1 xici = b, where we deﬁne ci to be the ith column of the matrix and
b the right-hand-side of (2.38). A solution to the problem in (2.38) can
be found immediately by taking 42 times the ﬁrst column and 8 times the
second column so that
b =

(2.39)
Therefore, a solution is [42, 8, 0, 0]⊤. This solution is called a particular
particular solution
solution or special solution. However, this is not the only solution of this
special solution
system of linear equations. To capture all the other solutions, we need
to be creative in generating 0 in a non-trivial way using the columns of
the matrix: Adding 0 to our special solution does not change the special
solution. To do so, we express the third column using the ﬁrst two columns
(which are of this very simple form)

so that 0 = 8c1 + 2c2 −1c3 + 0c4 and (x1, x2, x3, x4) = (8, 2, −1, 0). In
fact, any scaling of this solution by λ1 ∈R produces the 0 vector, i.e.,

matrix in (2.38) using the ﬁrst two columns and generate another set of
non-trivial versions of 0 as

Remark. The general approach we followed consisted of the following
three steps:
1. Find a particular solution to Ax = b.
2. Find all solutions to Ax = 0.
3. Combine the solutions from steps 1. and 2. to the general solution.
Neither the general nor the particular solution is unique.
♦
The system of linear equations in the preceding example was easy to
solve because the matrix in (2.38) has this particularly convenient form,
which allowed us to ﬁnd the particular and the general solution by in-
spection. However, general equation systems are not of this simple form.
Fortunately, there exists a constructive algorithmic way of transforming
any system of linear equations into this particularly simple form: Gaussian
elimination. Key to Gaussian elimination are elementary transformations
of systems of linear equations, which transform the equation system into
a simple form. Then, we can apply the three steps to the simple form that
we just discussed in the context of the example in (2.38).

In the following, we will detail a constructive way to obtain a particular
and general solution of a system of linear equations.
Remark (Pivots and Staircase Structure). The leading coefﬁcient of a row
(ﬁrst nonzero number from the left) is called the pivot and is always
pivot
strictly to the right of the pivot of the row above it. Therefore, any equa-
tion system in row-echelon form always has a “staircase” structure.
♦
Deﬁnition 2.6 (Row-Echelon Form). A matrix is in row-echelon form if
row-echelon form
All rows that contain only zeros are at the bottom of the matrix; corre-
spondingly, all rows that contain at least one nonzero element are on
top of rows that contain only zeros.
Looking at nonzero rows only, the ﬁrst nonzero number from the left
(also called the pivot or the leading coefﬁcient) is always strictly to the
pivot
leading coefﬁcient
right of the pivot of the row above it.
In other texts, it is
sometimes required
that the pivot is 1.
Remark (Basic and Free Variables). The variables corresponding to the
pivots in the row-echelon form are called basic variables and the other
basic variable
variables are free variables. For example, in (2.45), x1, x3, x4 are basic
free variable
variables, whereas x2, x5 are free variables.

our lives easier when we need to determine a particular solution. To do
this, we express the right-hand side of the equation system using the pivot
columns, such that b = PP
i=1 λipi, where pi, i = 1, . . . , P, are the pivot
columns. The λi are determined easiest if we start with the rightmost pivot
column and work our way to the left.
In the previous example, we would try to ﬁnd λ1, λ2, λ3 so that

(2.48)
From here, we ﬁnd relatively directly that λ3 = 1, λ2 = −1, λ1 = 2. When
we put everything together, we must not forget the non-pivot columns
for which we set the coefﬁcients implicitly to 0. Therefore, we get the
particular solution x = [2, 0, −1, 1, 0]⊤.

The key idea for ﬁnding the solutions of Ax = 0 is to look at the non-
pivot columns, which we will need to express as a (linear) combination of
the pivot columns. The reduced row echelon form makes this relatively
straightforward, and we express the non-pivot columns in terms of sums
and multiples of the pivot columns that are on their left: The second col-
umn is 3 times the ﬁrst column (we can ignore the pivot columns on the
right of the second column). Therefore, to obtain 0, we need to subtract

the second column from three times the ﬁrst column. Now, we look at the
ﬁfth column, which is our second non-pivot column. The ﬁfth column can
be expressed as 3 times the ﬁrst pivot column, 9 times the second pivot
column, and −4 times the third pivot column. We need to keep track of
the indices of the pivot columns and translate this into 3 times the ﬁrst col-
umn, 0 times the second column (which is a non-pivot column), 9 times
the third column (which is our second pivot column), and −4 times the
fourth column (which is the third pivot column). Then we need to subtract
the ﬁfth column to obtain 0. In the end, we are still solving a homogeneous
equation system.

columns form a basis (Section 2.6.1) of the solution space of Ax = 0,

Calculating the Inverse
To compute the inverse A−1 of A ∈Rn×n, we need to ﬁnd a matrix X
that satisﬁes AX = In. Then, X = A−1. We can write this down as
a set of simultaneous linear equations AX = In, where we solve for
X = [x1| · · · |xn]. We use the augmented matrix notation for a compact
representation of this set of systems of linear equations and obtain
A|In

⇝· · · ⇝
In|A−1 .
(2.56)
This means that if we bring the augmented equation system into reduced
row-echelon form, we can read out the inverse on the right-hand side of
the equation system. Hence, determining the inverse of a matrix is equiv-
alent to solving systems of linear equations.

2.3.4 Algorithms for Solving a System of Linear Equations
In the following, we brieﬂy discuss approaches to solving a system of lin-
ear equations of the form Ax = b. We make the assumption that a solu-
tion exists. Should there be no solution, we need to resort to approximate
solutions, which we do not cover in this chapter. One way to solve the ap-
proximate problem is using the approach of linear regression, which we
discuss in detail in Chapter 9.
In special cases, we may be able to determine the inverse A−1, such
that the solution of Ax = b is given as x = A−1b. However, this is
only possible if A is a square matrix and invertible, which is often not the
case. Otherwise, under mild assumptions (i.e., A needs to have linearly
independent columns) we can use the transformation
Ax = b ⇐⇒A⊤Ax = A⊤b ⇐⇒x = (A⊤A)−1A⊤b

and use the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse (A⊤A)−1A⊤to determine the
Moore-Penrose
pseudo-inverse
solution (2.59) that solves Ax = b, which also corresponds to the mini-
mum norm least-squares solution. A disadvantage of this approach is that
it requires many computations for the matrix-matrix product and comput-
ing the inverse of A⊤A. Moreover, for reasons of numerical precision it
is generally not recommended to compute the inverse or pseudo-inverse.
In the following, we therefore brieﬂy discuss alternative approaches to
solving systems of linear equations.
Gaussian elimination plays an important role when computing deter-
minants (Section 4.1), checking whether a set of vectors is linearly inde-
pendent (Section 2.5), computing the inverse of a matrix (Section 2.2.2),
computing the rank of a matrix (Section 2.6.2), and determining a basis
of a vector space (Section 2.6.1). Gaussian elimination is an intuitive and
constructive way to solve a system of linear equations with thousands of
variables. However, for systems with millions of variables, it is impracti-
cal as the required number of arithmetic operations scales cubically in the
number of simultaneous equations.
In practice, systems of many linear equations are solved indirectly, by ei-
ther stationary iterative methods, such as the Richardson method, the Ja-
cobi method, the Gauß-Seidel method, and the successive over-relaxation
method, or Krylov subspace methods, such as conjugate gradients, gener-
alized minimal residual, or biconjugate gradients. We refer to the books
by Stoer and Burlirsch (2002), Strang (2003), and Liesen and Mehrmann
(2015) for further details.
Let x∗be a solution of Ax = b. The key idea of these iterative methods
is to set up an iteration of the form
x(k+1) = Cx(k) + d
(2.60)
for suitable C and d that reduces the residual error ∥x(k+1) −x∗∥in every
iteration and converges to x∗. We will introduce norms ∥· ∥, which allow
us to compute similarities between vectors, in Section 3.1.
2.4 Vector Spaces
Thus far, we have looked at systems of linear equations and how to solve
them (Section 2.3). We saw that systems of linear equations can be com-
pactly represented using matrix-vector notation (2.10). In the following,
we will have a closer look at vector spaces, i.e., a structured space in which
vectors live.
In the beginning of this chapter, we informally characterized vectors as
objects that can be added together and multiplied by a scalar, and they
remain objects of the same type. Now, we are ready to formalize this,
and we will start by introducing the concept of a group, which is a set
of elements and an operation deﬁned on these elements that keeps some
structure of the set intact.

2.4.1 Groups
Groups play an important role in computer science. Besides providing a
fundamental framework for operations on sets, they are heavily used in
cryptography, coding theory, and graphics.
Deﬁnition 2.7 (Group). Consider a set G and an operation ⊗: G×G →G
deﬁned on G. Then G := (G, ⊗) is called a group if the following hold:
group
closure
1. Closure of G under ⊗: ∀x, y ∈G : x ⊗y ∈G
associativity
2. Associativity: ∀x, y, z ∈G : (x ⊗y) ⊗z = x ⊗(y ⊗z)
neutral element
3. Neutral element: ∃e ∈G ∀x ∈G : x ⊗e = x and e ⊗x = x
inverse element
4. Inverse element: ∀x ∈G ∃y ∈G : x ⊗y = e and y ⊗x = e, where e is
the neutral element. We often write x−1 to denote the inverse element
of x.
Remark. The inverse element is deﬁned with respect to the operation ⊗
and does not necessarily mean 1
x.
♦
If additionally ∀x, y ∈G : x ⊗y = y ⊗x, then G = (G, ⊗) is an Abelian
Abelian group
group (commutative).
Example 2.10 (Groups)
Let us have a look at some examples of sets with associated operations
and see whether they are groups:
(Z, +) is an Abelian group.
(N0, +) is not a group: Although (N0, +) possesses a neutral element
N0 := N ∪{0}
(0), the inverse elements are missing.
(Z, ·) is not a group: Although (Z, ·) contains a neutral element (1), the
inverse elements for any z ∈Z, z ̸= ±1, are missing.
(R, ·) is not a group since 0 does not possess an inverse element.
(R\{0}, ·) is Abelian.
(Rn, +), (Zn, +), n ∈N are Abelian if + is deﬁned componentwise, i.e.,
(x1, · · · , xn) + (y1, · · · , yn) = (x1 + y1, · · · , xn + yn).
(2.61)
Then, (x1, · · · , xn)−1 := (−x1, · · · , −xn) is the inverse element and
e = (0, · · · , 0) is the neutral element.
(Rm×n, +), the set of m × n-matrices is Abelian (with componentwise
addition as deﬁned in (2.61)).
Let us have a closer look at (Rn×n, ·), i.e., the set of n×n-matrices with
matrix multiplication as deﬁned in (2.13).
– Closure and associativity follow directly from the deﬁnition of matrix
multiplication.
– Neutral element: The identity matrix In is the neutral element with
respect to matrix multiplication “·” in (Rn×n, ·).
Draft (2021-01-14) of “Mathematics for Machine Learning”. Feedback: https://mml-book.com.

2.4 Vector Spaces
37
– Inverse element: If the inverse exists (A is regular), then A−1 is the
inverse element of A ∈Rn×n, and in exactly this case (Rn×n, ·) is a
group, called the general linear group.
Deﬁnition 2.8 (General Linear Group). The set of regular (invertible)
matrices A ∈Rn×n is a group with respect to matrix multiplication as
deﬁned in (2.13) and is called general linear group GL(n, R). However,
general linear group
since matrix multiplication is not commutative, the group is not Abelian.
2.4.2 Vector Spaces
When we discussed groups, we looked at sets G and inner operations on
G, i.e., mappings G × G →G that only operate on elements in G. In the
following, we will consider sets that in addition to an inner operation +
also contain an outer operation ·, the multiplication of a vector x ∈G by
a scalar λ ∈R. We can think of the inner operation as a form of addition,
and the outer operation as a form of scaling. Note that the inner/outer
operations have nothing to do with inner/outer products.
Deﬁnition 2.9 (Vector Space). A real-valued vector space V = (V, +, ·) is
vector space
a set V with two operations
+ : V × V →V
(2.62)
· : R × V →V
(2.63)
where
1. (V, +) is an Abelian group
2. Distributivity:
1. ∀λ ∈R, x, y ∈V : λ · (x + y) = λ · x + λ · y
2. ∀λ, ψ ∈R, x ∈V : (λ + ψ) · x = λ · x + ψ · x
3. Associativity (outer operation): ∀λ, ψ ∈R, x ∈V : λ·(ψ·x) = (λψ)·x
4. Neutral element with respect to the outer operation: ∀x ∈V : 1·x = x
The elements x ∈V are called vectors. The neutral element of (V, +) is
vector
the zero vector 0 = [0, . . . , 0]⊤, and the inner operation + is called vector
vector addition
addition. The elements λ ∈R are called scalars and the outer operation
scalar
· is a multiplication by scalars. Note that a scalar product is something
multiplication by
scalars
different, and we will get to this in Section 3.2.
Remark. A “vector multiplication” ab, a, b ∈Rn, is not deﬁned. Theoret-
ically, we could deﬁne an element-wise multiplication, such that c = ab
with cj = ajbj. This “array multiplication” is common to many program-
ming languages but makes mathematically limited sense using the stan-
dard rules for matrix multiplication: By treating vectors as n × 1 matrices

Linear Algebra
(which we usually do), we can use the matrix multiplication as deﬁned
in (2.13). However, then the dimensions of the vectors do not match. Only
the following multiplications for vectors are deﬁned: ab⊤∈Rn×n (outer
outer product
product), a⊤b ∈R (inner/scalar/dot product).
♦
Example 2.11 (Vector Spaces)
Let us have a look at some important examples:
V = Rn, n ∈N is a vector space with operations deﬁned as follows:
– Addition: x+y = (x1, . . . , xn)+(y1, . . . , yn) = (x1+y1, . . . , xn+yn)
for all x, y ∈Rn
– Multiplication by scalars: λx = λ(x1, . . . , xn) = (λx1, . . . , λxn) for
all λ ∈R, x ∈Rn
V = Rm×n, m, n ∈N is a vector space with
– Addition: A + B =

Section 2.2. Remember that Rm×n is equivalent to Rmn.
V = C, with the standard deﬁnition of addition of complex numbers.
Remark. In the following, we will denote a vector space (V, +, ·) by V
when + and · are the standard vector addition and scalar multiplication.
Moreover, we will use the notation x ∈V for vectors in V to simplify
notation.
♦
Remark. The vector spaces Rn, Rn×1, R1×n are only different in the way
we write vectors. In the following, we will not make a distinction between
Rn and Rn×1, which allows us to write n-tuples as column vectors
column vector
x =


x1
...
xn

.
(2.64)
This simpliﬁes the notation regarding vector space operations. However,
we do distinguish between Rn×1 and R1×n (the row vectors) to avoid con-
row vector
fusion with matrix multiplication. By default, we write x to denote a col-
umn vector, and a row vector is denoted by x⊤, the transpose of x.

2.4 Vector Spaces

2.4.3 Vector Subspaces
In the following, we will introduce vector subspaces. Intuitively, they are
sets contained in the original vector space with the property that when
we perform vector space operations on elements within this subspace, we
will never leave it. In this sense, they are “closed”. Vector subspaces are a
key idea in machine learning. For example, Chapter 10 demonstrates how
to use vector subspaces for dimensionality reduction.
Deﬁnition 2.10 (Vector Subspace). Let V = (V, +, ·) be a vector space
and U ⊆V, U ̸= ∅. Then U = (U, +, ·) is called vector subspace of V (or
vector subspace
linear subspace) if U is a vector space with the vector space operations +
linear subspace
and · restricted to U ×U and R×U. We write U ⊆V to denote a subspace
U of V .
If U ⊆V and V is a vector space, then U naturally inherits many prop-
erties directly from V because they hold for all x ∈V, and in particular for
all x ∈U ⊆V. This includes the Abelian group properties, the distribu-
tivity, the associativity and the neutral element. To determine whether
(U, +, ·) is a subspace of V we still do need to show
1. U ̸= ∅, in particular: 0 ∈U
2. Closure of U:
a. With respect to the outer operation: ∀λ ∈R ∀x ∈U : λx ∈U.
b. With respect to the inner operation: ∀x, y ∈U : x + y ∈U.
Example 2.12 (Vector Subspaces)
Let us have a look at some examples:
For every vector space V , the trivial subspaces are V itself and {0}.
Only example D in Figure 2.6 is a subspace of R2 (with the usual inner/
outer operations). In A and C, the closure property is violated; B does
not contain 0.
The solution set of a homogeneous system of linear equations Ax = 0
with n unknowns x = [x1, . . . , xn]⊤is a subspace of Rn.
The solution of an inhomogeneous system of linear equations Ax =
b, b ̸= 0 is not a subspace of Rn.
The intersection of arbitrarily many subspaces is a subspace itself.
Figure 2.6 Not all
subsets of R2 are
subspaces. In A and
C, the closure
property is violated;
B does not contain
0. Only D is a
subspace.

geneous system of linear equations Ax = 0 for x ∈Rn.

2.5 Linear Independence
In the following, we will have a close look at what we can do with vectors
(elements of the vector space). In particular, we can add vectors together
and multiply them with scalars. The closure property guarantees that we
end up with another vector in the same vector space. It is possible to ﬁnd
a set of vectors with which we can represent every vector in the vector
space by adding them together and scaling them. This set of vectors is
a basis, and we will discuss them in Section 2.6.1. Before we get there,
we will need to introduce the concepts of linear combinations and linear
independence.
Deﬁnition 2.11 (Linear Combination). Consider a vector space V and a
ﬁnite number of vectors x1, . . . , xk ∈V . Then, every v ∈V of the form
v = λ1x1 + · · · + λkxk =
k
X
i=1
λixi ∈V
(2.65)
with λ1, . . . , λk ∈R is a linear combination of the vectors x1, . . . , xk.
linear combination
The 0-vector can always be written as the linear combination of k vec-
tors x1, . . . , xk because 0 = Pk
i=1 0xi is always true. In the following,
we are interested in non-trivial linear combinations of a set of vectors to
represent 0, i.e., linear combinations of vectors x1, . . . , xk, where not all
coefﬁcients λi in (2.65) are 0.
Deﬁnition 2.12 (Linear (In)dependence). Let us consider a vector space
V with k ∈N and x1, . . . , xk ∈V . If there is a non-trivial linear com-
bination, such that 0 = Pk
i=1 λixi with at least one λi ̸= 0, the vectors
x1, . . . , xk are linearly dependent. If only the trivial solution exists, i.e.,
linearly dependent
λ1 = . . . = λk = 0 the vectors x1, . . . , xk are linearly independent.
linearly
independent
Linear independence is one of the most important concepts in linear
algebra. Intuitively, a set of linearly independent vectors consists of vectors
that have no redundancy, i.e., if we remove any of those vectors from
the set, we will lose something. Throughout the next sections, we will
formalize this intuition more.
Example 2.13 (Linearly Dependent Vectors)
A geographic example may help to clarify the concept of linear indepen-
dence. A person in Nairobi (Kenya) describing where Kigali (Rwanda) is
might say ,“You can get to Kigali by ﬁrst going 506 km Northwest to Kam-
pala (Uganda) and then 374 km Southwest.”. This is sufﬁcient information
Draft (2021-01-14) of “Mathematics for Machine Learning”. Feedback: https://mml-book.com.

2.5 Linear Independence
41
to describe the location of Kigali because the geographic coordinate sys-
tem may be considered a two-dimensional vector space (ignoring altitude
and the Earth’s curved surface). The person may add, “It is about 751 km
West of here.” Although this last statement is true, it is not necessary to
ﬁnd Kigali given the previous information (see Figure 2.7 for an illus-
tration). In this example, the “506 km Northwest” vector (blue) and the
“374 km Southwest” vector (purple) are linearly independent. This means
the Southwest vector cannot be described in terms of the Northwest vec-
tor, and vice versa. However, the third “751 km West” vector (black) is a
linear combination of the other two vectors, and it makes the set of vec-
tors linearly dependent. Equivalently, given “751 km West” and “374 km
Southwest” can be linearly combined to obtain “506 km Northwest”.

Remark. The following properties are useful to ﬁnd out whether vectors
are linearly independent:
k vectors are either linearly dependent or linearly independent. There
is no third option.
If at least one of the vectors x1, . . . , xk is 0 then they are linearly de-
pendent. The same holds if two vectors are identical.
The vectors {x1, . . . , xk : xi ̸= 0, i = 1, . . . , k}, k ⩾2, are linearly
dependent if and only if (at least) one of them is a linear combination
of the others. In particular, if one vector is a multiple of another vector,
i.e., xi = λxj, λ ∈R then the set {x1, . . . , xk : xi ̸= 0, i = 1, . . . , k}
is linearly dependent.
A practical way of checking whether vectors x1, . . . , xk ∈V are linearly
independent is to use Gaussian elimination: Write all vectors as columns
of a matrix A and perform Gaussian elimination until the matrix is in
row echelon form (the reduced row-echelon form is unnecessary here):

Linear Algebra
– The pivot columns indicate the vectors, which are linearly indepen-
dent of the vectors on the left. Note that there is an ordering of vec-
tors when the matrix is built.
– The non-pivot columns can be expressed as linear combinations of
the pivot columns on their left. For instance, the row-echelon form
1

(2.66)
tells us that the ﬁrst and third columns are pivot columns. The sec-
ond column is a non-pivot column because it is three times the ﬁrst
column.
All column vectors are linearly independent if and only if all columns
are pivot columns. If there is at least one non-pivot column, the columns
(and, therefore, the corresponding vectors) are linearly dependent.

We see that the corresponding linear equation system is non-trivially solv-
able: The last column is not a pivot column, and x4 = −7x1−15x2−18x3.
Therefore, x1, . . . , x4 are linearly dependent as x4 can be expressed as a
linear combination of x1, . . . , x3.
2.6 Basis and Rank
In a vector space V , we are particularly interested in sets of vectors A that
possess the property that any vector v ∈V can be obtained by a linear
combination of vectors in A. These vectors are special vectors, and in the
following, we will characterize them.
2.6.1 Generating Set and Basis
Deﬁnition 2.13 (Generating Set and Span). Consider a vector space V =
(V, +, ·) and set of vectors A = {x1, . . . , xk} ⊆V. If every vector v ∈
V can be expressed as a linear combination of x1, . . . , xk, A is called a
generating set of V . The set of all linear combinations of vectors in A is
generating set
called the span of A. If A spans the vector space V , we write V = span[A]
span
or V = span[x1, . . . , xk].
Generating sets are sets of vectors that span vector (sub)spaces, i.e.,
every vector can be represented as a linear combination of the vectors
in the generating set. Now, we will be more speciﬁc and characterize the
smallest generating set that spans a vector (sub)space.
Deﬁnition 2.14 (Basis). Consider a vector space V = (V, +, ·) and A ⊆
V. A generating set A of V is called minimal if there exists no smaller set
minimal
˜
A ⊊A ⊆V that spans V . Every linearly independent generating set of V
is minimal and is called a basis of V .

2.6 Basis and Rank

Let V = (V, +, ·) be a vector space and B ⊆V, B ̸= ∅. Then, the
following statements are equivalent:
A basis is a minimal
generating set and a
maximal linearly
independent set of
vectors.
B is a basis of V .
B is a minimal generating set.
B is a maximal linearly independent set of vectors in V , i.e., adding any
other vector to this set will make it linearly dependent.
Every vector x ∈V is a linear combination of vectors from B, and every
linear combination is unique, i.e., with
x =

For instance, the vector [1, 0, 0, 0]⊤cannot be obtained by a linear com-
bination of elements in A.
Remark. Every vector space V possesses a basis B. The preceding exam-
ples show that there can be many bases of a vector space V , i.e., there is
no unique basis. However, all bases possess the same number of elements,
the basis vectors.

We only consider ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces V . In this case, the
dimension of V is the number of basis vectors of V , and we write dim(V ).

can be thought of as the number of independent directions in this vector
space.
The dimension of a

corresponds to the
number of its basis

Remark. The dimension of a vector space is not necessarily the number

Remark. A basis of a subspace U = span[x1, . . . , xm] ⊆Rn can be found
by executing the following steps:
1. Write the spanning vectors as columns of a matrix A
2. Determine the row-echelon form of A.
3. The spanning vectors associated with the pivot columns are a basis of
U.

2.6 Basis and Rank

Since the pivot columns indicate which set of vectors is linearly indepen-
dent, we see from the row-echelon form that x1, x2, x4 are linearly inde-
pendent (because the system of linear equations λ1x1 + λ2x2 + λ4x4 = 0
can only be solved with λ1 = λ2 = λ4 = 0). Therefore, {x1, x2, x4} is a
basis of U.
2.6.2 Rank
The number of linearly independent columns of a matrix A ∈Rm×n
equals the number of linearly independent rows and is called the rank
rank
of A and is denoted by rk(A).
Remark. The rank of a matrix has some important properties:
rk(A) = rk(A⊤), i.e., the column rank equals the row rank.
The columns of A ∈Rm×n span a subspace U ⊆Rm with dim(U) =
rk(A). Later we will call this subspace the image or range. A basis of
U can be found by applying Gaussian elimination to A to identify the
pivot columns.
The rows of A ∈Rm×n span a subspace W ⊆Rn with dim(W) =
rk(A). A basis of W can be found by applying Gaussian elimination to
A⊤.
For all A ∈Rn×n it holds that A is regular (invertible) if and only if
rk(A) = n.
For all A ∈Rm×n and all b ∈Rm it holds that the linear equation
system Ax = b can be solved if and only if rk(A) = rk(A|b), where
A|b denotes the augmented system.
For A ∈Rm×n the subspace of solutions for Ax = 0 possesses dimen-
sion n −rk(A). Later, we will call this subspace the kernel or the null
kernel
null space
space.
A matrix A ∈Rm×n has full rank if its rank equals the largest possible
full rank
rank for a matrix of the same dimensions. This means that the rank of
a full-rank matrix is the lesser of the number of rows and columns, i.e.,
rk(A) = min(m, n). A matrix is said to be rank deﬁcient if it does not
rank deﬁcient
have full rank.

Here, we see that the number of linearly independent rows and columns
is 2, such that rk(A) = 2.
2.7 Linear Mappings
In the following, we will study mappings on vector spaces that preserve
their structure, which will allow us to deﬁne the concept of a coordinate.
In the beginning of the chapter, we said that vectors are objects that can be
added together and multiplied by a scalar, and the resulting object is still
a vector. We wish to preserve this property when applying the mapping:
Consider two real vector spaces V, W. A mapping Φ : V →W preserves
the structure of the vector space if
Φ(x + y) = Φ(x) + Φ(y)
(2.85)
Φ(λx) = λΦ(x)
(2.86)
for all x, y ∈V and λ ∈R. We can summarize this in the following
deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 2.15 (Linear Mapping). For vector spaces V, W, a mapping
Φ : V →W is called a linear mapping (or vector space homomorphism/
linear mapping
vector space
homomorphism
linear transformation) if
linear
transformation
∀x, y ∈V ∀λ, ψ ∈R : Φ(λx + ψy) = λΦ(x) + ψΦ(y) .
(2.87)
It turns out that we can represent linear mappings as matrices (Sec-
tion 2.7.1). Recall that we can also collect a set of vectors as columns of a
matrix. When working with matrices, we have to keep in mind what the
matrix represents: a linear mapping or a collection of vectors. We will see
more about linear mappings in Chapter 4. Before we continue, we will
brieﬂy introduce special mappings.
Deﬁnition 2.16 (Injective, Surjective, Bijective). Consider a mapping Φ :
V →W, where V, W can be arbitrary sets. Then Φ is called
injective
Injective if ∀x, y ∈V : Φ(x) = Φ(y) =⇒x = y.
surjective
Surjective if Φ(V) = W.
bijective
Bijective if it is injective and surjective.

2.7 Linear Mappings

If Φ is surjective, then every element in W can be “reached” from V
using Φ. A bijective Φ can be “undone”, i.e., there exists a mapping Ψ :
W →V so that Ψ ◦Φ(x) = x. This mapping Ψ is then called the inverse
of Φ and normally denoted by Φ−1.
With these deﬁnitions, we introduce the following special cases of linear
mappings between vector spaces V and W:
isomorphism
Isomorphism: Φ : V →W linear and bijective
endomorphism
Endomorphism: Φ : V →V linear
automorphism
Automorphism: Φ : V →V linear and bijective
We deﬁne idV : V →V , x 7→x as the identity mapping or identity
identity mapping

automorphism
automorphism in V .

(2.88)
This also justiﬁes why complex numbers can be represented as tuples in
R2: There is a bijective linear mapping that converts the elementwise addi-
tion of tuples in R2 into the set of complex numbers with the correspond-
ing addition. Note that we only showed linearity, but not the bijection.
Theorem 2.17 (Theorem 3.59 in Axler (2015)). Finite-dimensional vector
spaces V and W are isomorphic if and only if dim(V ) = dim(W).
Theorem 2.17 states that there exists a linear, bijective mapping be-
tween two vector spaces of the same dimension. Intuitively, this means
that vector spaces of the same dimension are kind of the same thing, as
they can be transformed into each other without incurring any loss.
Theorem 2.17 also gives us the justiﬁcation to treat Rm×n (the vector
space of m × n-matrices) and Rmn (the vector space of vectors of length
mn) the same, as their dimensions are mn, and there exists a linear, bi-
jective mapping that transforms one into the other.
Remark. Consider vector spaces V, W, X. Then:
For linear mappings Φ : V →W and Ψ : W →X, the mapping
Ψ ◦Φ : V →X is also linear.
If Φ : V →W is an isomorphism, then Φ−1 : W →V is an isomor-
phism, too.

2.7.1 Matrix Representation of Linear Mappings
Any n-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to Rn (Theorem 2.17). We
consider a basis {b1, . . . , bn} of an n-dimensional vector space V . In the
following, the order of the basis vectors will be important. Therefore, we
write
B = (b1, . . . , bn)
(2.89)
and call this n-tuple an ordered basis of V .

Remark (Notation). We are at the point where notation gets a bit tricky.
Therefore, we summarize some parts here. B = (b1, . . . , bn) is an ordered
basis, B = {b1, . . . , bn} is an (unordered) basis, and B = [b1, . . . , bn] is a
matrix whose columns are the vectors b1, . . . , bn.

A basis effectively deﬁnes a coordinate system. We are familiar with the
Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions, which is spanned by the
canonical basis vectors e1, e2. In this coordinate system, a vector x ∈R2
has a representation that tells us how to linearly combine e1 and e2 to
obtain x. However, any basis of R2 deﬁnes a valid coordinate system,
and the same vector x from before may have a different coordinate rep-
resentation in the (b1, b2) basis. In Figure 2.8, the coordinates of x with
respect to the standard basis (e1, e2) is [2, 2]⊤. However, with respect to
the basis (b1, b2) the same vector x is represented as [1.09, 0.72]⊤, i.e.,
x = 1.09b1 + 0.72b2. In the following sections, we will discover how to
obtain this representation.
Example 2.20
Let us have a look at a geometric vector x ∈R2 with coordinates [2, 3]⊤

x = 2e1 + 3e2
with respect to the standard basis (e1, e2) of R2. This means, we can write
x = 2e1 + 3e2. However, we do not have to choose the standard basis to
represent this vector. If we use the basis vectors b1 = [1, −1]⊤, b2 = [1, 1]⊤
we will obtain the coordinates 1
2[−1, 5]⊤to represent the same vector with
respect to (b1, b2) (see Figure 2.9).
Remark. For an n-dimensional vector space V and an ordered basis B
of V , the mapping Φ : Rn →V , Φ(ei) = bi, i = 1, . . . , n, is linear
(and because of Theorem 2.17 an isomorphism), where (e1, . . . , en) is
the standard basis of Rn.
♦
Now we are ready to make an explicit connection between matrices and
linear mappings between ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.19 (Transformation Matrix). Consider vector spaces V, W
with corresponding (ordered) bases B = (b1, . . . , bn) and C = (c1, . . . , cm).
Moreover, we consider a linear mapping Φ : V →W. For j ∈{1, . . . , n},
Φ(bj) = α1jc1 + · · · + αmjcm =

X
i=1

AΦ(i, j) = αij ,
(2.93)
the transformation matrix of Φ (with respect to the ordered bases B of V
transformation
matrix
and C of W).
The coordinates of Φ(bj) with respect to the ordered basis C of W
are the j-th column of AΦ. Consider (ﬁnite-dimensional) vector spaces
V, W with ordered bases B, C and a linear mapping Φ : V →W with

transformation matrix AΦ. If ˆx is the coordinate vector of x ∈V with
respect to B and ˆy the coordinate vector of y = Φ(x) ∈W with respect
to C, then
ˆy = AΦˆx .
(2.94)
This means that the transformation matrix can be used to map coordinates
with respect to an ordered basis in V to coordinates with respect to an
ordered basis in W.
Example 2.21 (Transformation Matrix)
Consider a homomorphism Φ : V

Figure 2.10 gives three examples of linear transformations of a set of vec-
tors. Figure 2.10(a) shows 400 vectors in R2, each of which is represented
by a dot at the corresponding (x1, x2)-coordinates. The vectors are ar-
ranged in a square. When we use matrix A1 in (2.97) to linearly transform
each of these vectors, we obtain the rotated square in Figure 2.10(b). If we
apply the linear mapping represented by A2, we obtain the rectangle in
Figure 2.10(c) where each x1-coordinate is stretched by 2. Figure 2.10(d)
shows the original square from Figure 2.10(a) when linearly transformed
using A3, which is a combination of a reﬂection, a rotation, and a stretch.
2.7.2 Basis Change
In the following, we will have a closer look at how transformation matrices
of a linear mapping Φ : V →W change if we change the bases in V and
W. Consider two ordered bases
B = (b1, . . . , bn),
˜B = (˜b1, . . . , ˜bn)
(2.98)
of V and two ordered bases
C = (c1, . . . , cm),
˜C = (˜c1, . . . , ˜cm)
(2.99)
of W. Moreover, AΦ ∈Rm×n is the transformation matrix of the linear
mapping Φ : V →W with respect to the bases B and C, and ˜AΦ ∈Rm×n
is the corresponding transformation mapping with respect to ˜B and ˜C.
In the following, we will investigate how A and ˜A are related, i.e., how/
whether we can transform AΦ into ˜AΦ if we choose to perform a basis
change from B, C to ˜B, ˜C.
Remark. We effectively get different coordinate representations of the
identity mapping idV . In the context of Figure 2.9, this would mean to
map coordinates with respect to (e1, e2) onto coordinates with respect to
(b1, b2) without changing the vector x. By changing the basis and corre-
spondingly the representation of vectors, the transformation matrix with
respect to this new basis can have a particularly simple form that allows
for straightforward computation.

explanation.
Theorem 2.20 (Basis Change). For a linear mapping Φ : V →W, ordered
bases
B = (b1, . . . , bn),
˜B = (˜b1, . . . , ˜bn)
(2.103)
of V and
C = (c1, . . . , cm),
˜C = (˜c1, . . . , ˜cm)
(2.104)
of W, and a transformation matrix AΦ of Φ with respect to B and C, the
corresponding transformation matrix ˜AΦ with respect to the bases ˜B and ˜C
is given as
˜AΦ = T −1AΦS .
(2.105)
Here, S ∈Rn×n is the transformation matrix of idV that maps coordinates
with respect to ˜B onto coordinates with respect to B, and T ∈Rm×m is the
transformation matrix of idW that maps coordinates with respect to ˜C onto
coordinates with respect to C.
Proof
Following Drumm and Weil (2001), we can write the vectors of
the new basis ˜B of V as a linear combination of the basis vectors of B,
such that
˜bj = s1jb1 + · · · + snjbn =
n
X
i=1
sijbi ,
j = 1, . . . , n .
(2.106)
Similarly, we write the new basis vectors ˜C of W as a linear combination
of the basis vectors of C, which yields
˜ck = t1kc1 + · · · + tmkcm =
m
X
l=1
tlkcl ,
k = 1, . . . , m .
(2.107)
We deﬁne S = ((sij)) ∈Rn×n as the transformation matrix that maps
coordinates with respect to ˜B onto coordinates with respect to B and
T = ((tlk)) ∈Rm×m as the transformation matrix that maps coordinates
with respect to ˜C onto coordinates with respect to C. In particular, the jth
column of S is the coordinate representation of ˜bj with respect to B and

the kth column of T is the coordinate representation of ˜ck with respect to
C. Note that both S and T are regular.
We are going to look at Φ(˜bj) from two perspectives. First, applying the
mapping Φ, we get that for all j = 1, . . . , n

which proves Theorem 2.20.
Theorem 2.20 tells us that with a basis change in V (B is replaced with
˜B) and W (C is replaced with ˜C), the transformation matrix AΦ of a
linear mapping Φ : V →W is replaced by an equivalent matrix ˜AΦ with
˜AΦ = T −1AΦS.

instantiation of Φ and maps basis vectors of B onto linear combinations
of basis vectors of C. Assume that we know the transformation matrix AΦ

respect to the “old” basis B (in V ). Then, we use the transformation ma-
trix AΦ of ΦCB : V →W to map these coordinates onto the coordinates
with respect to C in W. Finally, we use a linear mapping Ξ ˜
CC : W →W
to map the coordinates with respect to C onto coordinates with respect to
˜C. Therefore, we can express the linear mapping Φ ˜

Deﬁnition 2.22 (Similarity). Two matrices A, ˜A ∈Rn×n are similar if

there exists a regular matrix S ∈Rn×n with ˜A = S−1AS
Remark. Similar matrices are always equivalent. However, equivalent ma-
trices are not necessarily similar.

Remark. Consider vector spaces V, W, X. From the remark that follows
Theorem 2.17, we already know that for linear mappings Φ : V →W
and Ψ : W →X the mapping Ψ ◦Φ : V →X is also linear. With
transformation matrices AΦ and AΨ of the corresponding mappings, the
overall transformation matrix is AΨ◦Φ = AΨAΦ.
♦
In light of this remark, we can look at basis changes from the perspec-
tive of composing linear mappings:
AΦ is the transformation matrix of a linear mapping ΦCB : V →W
with respect to the bases B, C.
˜AΦ is the transformation matrix of the linear mapping Φ ˜
C ˜
B : V →W
with respect to the bases ˜B, ˜C.
S is the transformation matrix of a linear mapping ΨB ˜
B : V →V
(automorphism) that represents ˜B in terms of B. Normally, Ψ = idV is
the identity mapping in V .

T is the transformation matrix of a linear mapping ΞC ˜

In Chapter 4, we will be able to exploit the concept of a basis change

will look at a data compression problem and ﬁnd a convenient basis onto
which we can project the data while minimizing the compression loss.
2.7.3 Image and Kernel
The image and kernel of a linear mapping are vector subspaces with cer-
tain important properties. In the following, we will characterize them
more carefully.
Deﬁnition 2.23 (Image and Kernel).
For Φ : V →W, we deﬁne the kernel/null space
kernel

ker(Φ) := Φ−1(0W) = {v ∈V : Φ(v) = 0W}
(2.122)
and the image/range
image
range
Im(Φ) := Φ(V ) = {w ∈W|∃v ∈V : Φ(v) = w} .
(2.123)
We also call V and W also the domain and codomain of Φ, respectively.
domain
codomain
Intuitively, the kernel is the set of vectors v ∈V that Φ maps onto the
neutral element 0W ∈W. The image is the set of vectors w ∈W that
can be “reached” by Φ from any vector in V . An illustration is given in
Figure 2.12.
Remark. Consider a linear mapping Φ : V →W, where V, W are vector
spaces.
It always holds that Φ(0V ) = 0W and, therefore, 0V ∈ker(Φ). In
particular, the null space is never empty.
Im(Φ) ⊆W is a subspace of W, and ker(Φ) ⊆V is a subspace of V .

Remark (Null Space and Column Space). Let us consider A ∈Rm×n and
a linear mapping Φ : Rn →Rm, x 7→Ax.
For A = [a1, . . . , an], where ai are the columns of A, we obtain
Im(Φ) = {Ax : x ∈Rn} =

i.e., the image is the span of the columns of A, also called the column
column space
space. Therefore, the column space (image) is a subspace of Rm, where
m is the “height” of the matrix.
rk(A) = dim(Im(Φ)).
The kernel/null space ker(Φ) is the general solution to the homoge-
neous system of linear equations Ax = 0 and captures all possible
linear combinations of the elements in Rn that produce 0 ∈Rm.
The kernel is a subspace of Rn, where n is the “width” of the matrix.
The kernel focuses on the relationship among the columns, and we can
use it to determine whether/how we can express a column as a linear
combination of other columns.

To compute the kernel (null space) of Φ, we need to solve Ax = 0, i.e.,
we need to solve a homogeneous equation system. To do this, we use

This matrix is in reduced row-echelon form, and we can use the Minus-
1 Trick to compute a basis of the kernel (see Section 2.3.3). Alternatively,
we can express the non-pivot columns (columns 3 and 4) as linear com-
binations of the pivot columns (columns 1 and 2). The third column a3 is
equivalent to −1
2 times the second column a2. Therefore, 0 = a3+ 1
2a2. In
the same way, we see that a4 = a1−1
2a2 and, therefore, 0 = a1−1
2a2−a4.
Overall, this gives us the kernel (null space) as

rank-nullity
theorem
Theorem 2.24 (Rank-Nullity Theorem). For vector spaces V, W and a lin-
ear mapping Φ : V →W it holds that
dim(ker(Φ)) + dim(Im(Φ)) = dim(V ) .
(2.129)
The rank-nullity theorem is also referred to as the fundamental theorem
fundamental
theorem of linear
mappings
of linear mappings (Axler, 2015, theorem 3.22). The following are direct
consequences of Theorem 2.24:
If dim(Im(Φ)) < dim(V ), then ker(Φ) is non-trivial, i.e., the kernel
contains more than 0V and dim(ker(Φ)) ⩾1.
If AΦ is the transformation matrix of Φ with respect to an ordered basis
and dim(Im(Φ)) < dim(V ), then the system of linear equations AΦx =
0 has inﬁnitely many solutions.
If dim(V ) = dim(W), then the following three-way equivalence holds:
– Φ is injective
– Φ is surjective
– Φ is bijective
since Im(Φ) ⊆W.

2.8 Afﬁne Spaces
In the following, we will have a closer look at spaces that are offset from
the origin, i.e., spaces that are no longer vector subspaces. Moreover, we
will brieﬂy discuss properties of mappings between these afﬁne spaces,
which resemble linear mappings.
Remark. In the machine learning literature, the distinction between linear
and afﬁne is sometimes not clear so that we can ﬁnd references to afﬁne
spaces/mappings as linear spaces/mappings.

2.8.1 Afﬁne Subspaces
Deﬁnition 2.25 (Afﬁne Subspace). Let V be a vector space, x0 ∈V and
U ⊆V a subspace. Then the subset
L = x0 + U := {x0 + u : u ∈U}
(2.130a)
= {v ∈V |∃u ∈U : v = x0 + u} ⊆V
(2.130b)
is called afﬁne subspace or linear manifold of V . U is called direction or
afﬁne subspace
linear manifold
direction
direction space, and x0 is called support point. In Chapter 12, we refer to
direction space
support point
such a subspace as a hyperplane.
hyperplane
Note that the deﬁnition of an afﬁne subspace excludes 0 if x0 /∈U.
Therefore, an afﬁne subspace is not a (linear) subspace (vector subspace)
of V for x0 /∈U.
Examples of afﬁne subspaces are points, lines, and planes in R3, which
do not (necessarily) go through the origin.
Remark. Consider two afﬁne subspaces L = x0 + U and ˜L = ˜x0 + ˜U of a
vector space V . Then, L ⊆˜L if and only if U ⊆˜U and x0 −˜x0 ∈˜U.
Afﬁne subspaces are often described by parameters: Consider a k-dimen-
sional afﬁne space L = x0 + U of V . If (b1, . . . , bk) is an ordered basis of
U, then every element x ∈L can be uniquely described as
x = x0 + λ1b1 + . . . + λkbk ,

where λ1, . . . , λk ∈R. This representation is called parametric equation

Example 2.26 (Afﬁne Subspaces)
One-dimensional afﬁne subspaces are called lines and can be written
line
as y = x0 + λb1, where λ ∈R and U = span[b1] ⊆Rn is a one-
dimensional subspace of Rn. This means that a line is deﬁned by a sup-
port point x0 and a vector b1 that deﬁnes the direction. See Figure 2.13
for an illustration.

Linear Algebra
Two-dimensional afﬁne subspaces of Rn are called planes. The para-
plane
metric equation for planes is y = x0 + λ1b1 + λ2b2, where λ1, λ2 ∈R
and U = span[b1, b2] ⊆Rn. This means that a plane is deﬁned by a
support point x0 and two linearly independent vectors b1, b2 that span
the direction space.
In Rn, the (n −1)-dimensional afﬁne subspaces are called hyperplanes,
hyperplane
and the corresponding parametric equation is y = x0 + Pn−1
i=1 λibi,
where b1, . . . , bn−1 form a basis of an (n −1)-dimensional subspace
U of Rn. This means that a hyperplane is deﬁned by a support point
x0 and (n −1) linearly independent vectors b1, . . . , bn−1 that span the
direction space. In R2, a line is also a hyperplane. In R3, a plane is also
a hyperplane.

Remark (Inhomogeneous systems of linear equations and afﬁne subspaces).
For A ∈Rm×n and x ∈Rm, the solution of the system of linear equa-
tions Aλ = x is either the empty set or an afﬁne subspace of Rn of
dimension n −rk(A). In particular, the solution of the linear equation
λ1b1 + . . . + λnbn = x, where (λ1, . . . , λn) ̸= (0, . . . , 0), is a hyperplane
in Rn.
In Rn, every k-dimensional afﬁne subspace is the solution of an inho-
mogeneous system of linear equations Ax = b, where A ∈Rm×n, b ∈
Rm and rk(A) = n −k. Recall that for homogeneous equation systems
Ax = 0 the solution was a vector subspace, which we can also think of
as a special afﬁne space with support point x0 = 0.

2.8.2 Afﬁne Mappings
Similar to linear mappings between vector spaces, which we discussed
in Section 2.7, we can deﬁne afﬁne mappings between two afﬁne spaces.
Linear and afﬁne mappings are closely related. Therefore, many properties
that we already know from linear mappings, e.g., that the composition of
linear mappings is a linear mapping, also hold for afﬁne mappings.

x 7→a + Φ(x)
(2.133)
is an afﬁne mapping from V to W. The vector a is called the translation
afﬁne mapping

vector of φ.
Every afﬁne mapping φ : V →W is also the composition of a linear
mapping Φ : V →W and a translation τ : W →W in W, such that
φ = τ ◦Φ. The mappings Φ and τ are uniquely determined.
The composition φ′ ◦φ of afﬁne mappings φ : V →W, φ′ : W →X is
afﬁne.
Afﬁne mappings keep the geometric structure invariant. They also pre-
serve the dimension and parallelism.
2.9 Further Reading
There are many resources for learning linear algebra, including the text-
books by Strang (2003), Golan (2007), Axler (2015), and Liesen and
Mehrmann (2015). There are also several online resources that we men-
tioned in the introduction to this chapter. We only covered Gaussian elim-
ination here, but there are many other approaches for solving systems of
linear equations, and we refer to numerical linear algebra textbooks by
Stoer and Burlirsch (2002), Golub and Van Loan (2012), and Horn and
Johnson (2013) for an in-depth discussion.
In this book, we distinguish between the topics of linear algebra (e.g.,
vectors, matrices, linear independence, basis) and topics related to the
geometry of a vector space. In Chapter 3, we will introduce the inner
product, which induces a norm. These concepts allow us to deﬁne angles,

We consider (R\{−1}, ⋆), where
a ⋆b := ab + a + b,
a, b ∈R\{−1}
(2.134)
a. Show that (R\{−1}, ⋆) is an Abelian group.
b. Solve

Let n be in N\{0}. Let k, x be in Z. We deﬁne the congruence class ¯k of the
integer k as the set
k = {x ∈Z | x −k = 0 (modn)}
= {x ∈Z | ∃a ∈Z: (x −k = n · a)} .
We now deﬁne Z/nZ (sometimes written Zn) as the set of all congruence
classes modulo n. Euclidean division implies that this set is a ﬁnite set con-
taining n elements:
Zn = {0, 1, . . . , n −1}
For all a, b ∈Zn, we deﬁne
a ⊕b := a + b
a. Show that (Zn, ⊕) is a group. Is it Abelian?
b. We now deﬁne another operation ⊗for all a and b in Zn as
a ⊗b = a × b ,
(2.135)
where a × b represents the usual multiplication in Z.
Let n = 5. Draw the times table of the elements of Z5\{0} under ⊗, i.e.,
calculate the products a ⊗b for all a and b in Z5\{0}.
Hence, show that Z5\{0} is closed under ⊗and possesses a neutral
element for ⊗. Display the inverse of all elements in Z5\{0} under ⊗.
Conclude that (Z5\{0}, ⊗) is an Abelian group.
c. Show that (Z8\{0}, ⊗) is not a group.
d. We recall that the B´ezout theorem states that two integers a and b are
relatively prime (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1) if and only if there exist two integers
u and v such that au + bv = 1. Show that (Zn\{0}, ⊗) is a group if and
only if n ∈N\{0} is prime.

Analytic Geometry
In Chapter 2, we studied vectors, vector spaces, and linear mappings at
a general but abstract level. In this chapter, we will add some geomet-
ric interpretation and intuition to all of these concepts. In particular, we
will look at geometric vectors and compute their lengths and distances
or angles between two vectors. To be able to do this, we equip the vec-
tor space with an inner product that induces the geometry of the vector
space. Inner products and their corresponding norms and metrics capture
the intuitive notions of similarity and distances, which we use to develop
the support vector machine in Chapter 12. We will then use the concepts
of lengths and angles between vectors to discuss orthogonal projections,
which will play a central role when we discuss principal component anal-
ysis in Chapter 10 and regression via maximum likelihood estimation in
Chapter 9. Figure 3.1 gives an overview of how concepts in this chapter
are related and how they are connected to other chapters of the book.

3.1 Norms
When we think of geometric vectors, i.e., directed line segments that start
at the origin, then intuitively the length of a vector is the distance of the
“end” of this directed line segment from the origin. In the following, we
will discuss the notion of the length of vectors using the concept of a norm.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Norm). A norm on a vector space V is a function
norm
∥· ∥: V →R ,
(3.1)
x 7→∥x∥,
(3.2)
which assigns each vector x its length ∥x∥∈R, such that for all λ ∈R
length
and x, y ∈V the following hold:
absolutely
homogeneous
Absolutely homogeneous: ∥λx∥= |λ|∥x∥
triangle inequality
Triangle inequality: ∥x + y∥⩽∥x∥+ ∥y∥
positive deﬁnite
Positive deﬁnite: ∥x∥⩾0 and ∥x∥= 0 ⇐⇒x = 0
Figure 3.2 Triangle
inequality.
a
b
c ≤a + b
In geometric terms, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle,
the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal
to the length of the remaining side; see Figure 3.2 for an illustration.
Deﬁnition 3.1 is in terms of a general vector space V (Section 2.4), but
in this book we will only consider a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space Rn.
Recall that for a vector x ∈Rn we denote the elements of the vector using
a subscript, that is, xi is the ith element of the vector x.
Example 3.1 (Manhattan Norm)
The Manhattan norm on Rn is deﬁned for x ∈Rn as
Manhattan norm
∥x∥1 :=
n
X
i=1
|xi| ,
(3.3)
where | · | is the absolute value. The left panel of Figure 3.3 shows all
vectors x ∈R2 with ∥x∥1 = 1. The Manhattan norm is also called ℓ1
ℓ1 norm

and computes the Euclidean distance of x from the origin. The right panel

norm is also called ℓ2 norm.

Remark. Throughout this book, we will use the Euclidean norm (3.4) by
default if not stated otherwise.

3.2 Inner Products
Inner products allow for the introduction of intuitive geometrical con-
cepts, such as the length of a vector and the angle or distance between
two vectors. A major purpose of inner products is to determine whether
vectors are orthogonal to each other.
3.2.1 Dot Product
We may already be familiar with a particular type of inner product, the
scalar product/dot product in Rn, which is given by
scalar product
dot product
x⊤y =
n
X
i=1
xiyi .
(3.5)
We will refer to this particular inner product as the dot product in this
book. However, inner products are more general concepts with speciﬁc
properties, which we will now introduce.
3.2.2 General Inner Products
Recall the linear mapping from Section 2.7, where we can rearrange the
mapping with respect to addition and multiplication with a scalar. A bi-
bilinear mapping
linear mapping Ωis a mapping with two arguments, and it is linear in
each argument, i.e., when we look at a vector space V then it holds that
for all x, y, z ∈V, λ, ψ ∈R that
Ω(λx + ψy, z) = λΩ(x, z) + ψΩ(y, z)
(3.6)
Ω(x, λy + ψz) = λΩ(x, y) + ψΩ(x, z) .
(3.7)
Here, (3.6) asserts that Ωis linear in the ﬁrst argument, and (3.7) asserts
that Ωis linear in the second argument (see also (2.87)).

3.2 Inner Products
73
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let V be a vector space and Ω: V × V →R be a bilinear
mapping that takes two vectors and maps them onto a real number. Then
Ωis called symmetric if Ω(x, y) = Ω(y, x) for all x, y ∈V , i.e., the
symmetric
order of the arguments does not matter.
Ωis called positive deﬁnite if
positive deﬁnite
∀x ∈V \{0} : Ω(x, x) > 0 ,
Ω(0, 0) = 0 .
(3.8)
Deﬁnition 3.3. Let V be a vector space and Ω: V × V →R be a bilinear
mapping that takes two vectors and maps them onto a real number. Then
A positive deﬁnite, symmetric bilinear mapping Ω: V ×V →R is called
an inner product on V . We typically write ⟨x, y⟩instead of Ω(x, y).
inner product
The pair (V, ⟨·, ·⟩) is called an inner product space or (real) vector space

vector space with
inner product
with inner product. If we use the dot product deﬁned in (3.5), we call
(V, ⟨·, ·⟩) a Euclidean vector space.
Euclidean vector
space
We will refer to these spaces as inner product spaces in this book.
Example 3.3 (Inner Product That Is Not the Dot Product)
Consider V = R2. If we deﬁne
⟨x, y⟩:= x1y1 −(x1y2 + x2y1) + 2x2y2
(3.9)
then ⟨·, ·⟩is an inner product but different from the dot product. The proof
will be an exercise.
3.2.3 Symmetric, Positive Deﬁnite Matrices
Symmetric, positive deﬁnite matrices play an important role in machine
learning, and they are deﬁned via the inner product. In Section 4.3, we
will return to symmetric, positive deﬁnite matrices in the context of matrix
decompositions. The idea of symmetric positive semideﬁnite matrices is
key in the deﬁnition of kernels (Section 12.4).
Consider an n-dimensional vector space V with an inner product ⟨·, ·⟩:
V × V →R (see Deﬁnition 3.3) and an ordered basis B = (b1, . . . , bn) of
V . Recall from Section 2.6.1 that any vectors x, y ∈V can be written as
linear combinations of the basis vectors so that x = Pn
i=1 ψibi ∈V and
y = Pn
j=1 λjbj ∈V for suitable ψi, λj ∈R. Due to the bilinearity of the
inner product, it holds for all x, y ∈V that
⟨x, y⟩=

ψi ⟨bi, bj⟩λj = ˆx⊤Aˆy , (3.10)
where Aij := ⟨bi, bj⟩and ˆx, ˆy are the coordinates of x and y with respect
to the basis B. This implies that the inner product ⟨·, ·⟩is uniquely deter-
mined through A. The symmetry of the inner product also means that A

is symmetric. Furthermore, the positive deﬁniteness of the inner product
implies that

3.3 Lengths and Distances
In Section 3.1, we already discussed norms that we can use to compute
the length of a vector. Inner products and norms are closely related in the
sense that any inner product induces a norm

∥x∥:=

in a natural way, such that we can compute lengths of vectors using the in-
ner product. However, not every norm is induced by an inner product. The
Manhattan norm (3.3) is an example of a norm without a corresponding
inner product. In the following, we will focus on norms that are induced
by inner products and introduce geometric concepts, such as lengths, dis-
tances, and angles.
Remark (Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality). For an inner product vector space
(V, ⟨·, ·⟩) the induced norm ∥· ∥satisﬁes the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality

Example 3.5 (Lengths of Vectors Using Inner Products)
In geometry, we are often interested in lengths of vectors. We can now use
an inner product to compute them using (3.16). Let us take x = [1, 1]⊤∈
R2. If we use the dot product as the inner product, with (3.16) we obtain
∥x∥=
√
x⊤x =


y = x1y1 −1
2(x1y2 + x2y1) + x2y2 .
(3.19)
If we compute the norm of a vector, then this inner product returns smaller
values than the dot product if x1 and x2 have the same sign (and x1x2 >
0); otherwise, it returns greater values than the dot product. With this
inner product, we obtain
⟨x, x⟩= x2
1 −x1x2 + x2
2 = 1 −1 + 1 = 1 =⇒∥x∥=

1 = 1 , (3.20)
such that x is “shorter” with this inner product than with the dot product.

(V, ⟨·, ·⟩). Then
d(x, y) := ∥x −y∥=

Remark. Similar to the length of a vector, the distance between vectors
does not require an inner product: a norm is sufﬁcient. If we have a norm
induced by an inner product, the distance may vary depending on the
choice of the inner product.

A metric d satisﬁes the following:
1. d is positive deﬁnite, i.e., d(x, y) ⩾0 for all x, y ∈V and d(x, y) =
positive deﬁnite
0 ⇐⇒x = y .
2. d is symmetric, i.e., d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈V .

3. Triangle inequality: d(x, z) ⩽d(x, y) + d(y, z) for all x, y, z ∈V .
Remark. At ﬁrst glance, the lists of properties of inner products and met-
rics look very similar. However, by comparing Deﬁnition 3.3 with Deﬁni-
tion 3.6 we observe that ⟨x, y⟩and d(x, y) behave in opposite directions.
Very similar x and y will result in a large value for the inner product and
a small value for the metric.

In addition to enabling the deﬁnition of lengths of vectors, as well as the
distance between two vectors, inner products also capture the geometry
of a vector space by deﬁning the angle ω between two vectors. We use
the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (3.17) to deﬁne angles ω in inner prod-
uct spaces between two vectors x, y, and this notion coincides with our
intuition in R2 and R3. Assume that x ̸= 0, y ̸= 0. Then

Therefore, there exists a unique ω ∈[0, π], illustrated in Figure 3.4, with
cos ω =
⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥.
(3.25)
The number ω is the angle between the vectors x and y. Intuitively, the
angle
angle between two vectors tells us how similar their orientations are. For
example, using the dot product, the angle between x and y = 4x, i.e., y
is a scaled version of x, is 0: Their orientation is the same.

corresponds to about 18◦.
A key feature of the inner product is that it also allows us to characterize
vectors that are orthogonal.
Deﬁnition 3.7 (Orthogonality). Two vectors x and y are orthogonal if and
orthogonal
only if ⟨x, y⟩= 0, and we write x ⊥y. If additionally ∥x∥= 1 = ∥y∥,
i.e., the vectors are unit vectors, then x and y are orthonormal.
orthonormal
An implication of this deﬁnition is that the 0-vector is orthogonal to
every vector in the vector space.
Remark. Orthogonality is the generalization of the concept of perpendic-
ularity to bilinear forms that do not have to be the dot product. In our
context, geometrically, we can think of orthogonal vectors as having a
right angle with respect to a speciﬁc inner product.

an angle ω between x and y of 90◦, such that x ⊥y. However, if we

cos ω = ⟨x, y⟩
∥x∥∥y∥= −1
3 =⇒ω ≈1.91 rad ≈109.5◦,
(3.28)
and x and y are not orthogonal. Therefore, vectors that are orthogonal
with respect to one inner product do not have to be orthogonal with re-
spect to a different inner product.
Deﬁnition 3.8 (Orthogonal Matrix). A square matrix A ∈Rn×n is an
orthogonal matrix if and only if its columns are orthonormal so that
orthogonal matrix
AA⊤= I = A⊤A ,
(3.29)
which implies that
A−1 = A⊤,
(3.30)
i.e., the inverse is obtained by simply transposing the matrix.
It is convention to
call these matrices
“orthogonal” but a
more precise
description would
be “orthonormal”.
Transformations by orthogonal matrices are special because the length
of a vector x is not changed when transforming it using an orthogonal
matrix A. For the dot product, we obtain

2 .
(3.31)
Moreover, the angle between any two vectors x, y, as measured by their
inner product, is also unchanged when transforming both of them using
an orthogonal matrix A. Assuming the dot product as the inner product,
the angle of the images Ax and Ay is given as
cos ω = (Ax)⊤(Ay)
∥Ax∥∥Ay∥=
x⊤A⊤Ay

∥x∥∥y∥,
(3.32)
which gives exactly the angle between x and y. This means that orthog-
onal matrices A with A⊤= A−1 preserve both angles and distances. It
turns out that orthogonal matrices deﬁne transformations that are rota-
tions (with the possibility of ﬂips). In Section 3.9, we will discuss more
details about rotations.
3.5 Orthonormal Basis
In Section 2.6.1, we characterized properties of basis vectors and found
that in an n-dimensional vector space, we need n basis vectors, i.e., n
vectors that are linearly independent. In Sections 3.3 and 3.4, we used
inner products to compute the length of vectors and the angle between
vectors. In the following, we will discuss the special case where the basis
vectors are orthogonal to each other and where the length of each basis
vector is 1. We will call this basis then an orthonormal basis.

3.6 Orthogonal Complement

Let us introduce this more formally.
Deﬁnition 3.9 (Orthonormal Basis). Consider an n-dimensional vector
space V and a basis {b1, . . . , bn} of V . If
⟨bi, bj⟩= 0
for i ̸= j
(3.33)
⟨bi, bi⟩= 1
(3.34)
for all i, j = 1, . . . , n then the basis is called an orthonormal basis (ONB).
orthonormal basis
ONB
If only (3.33) is satisﬁed, then the basis is called an orthogonal basis. Note
orthogonal basis
that (3.34) implies that every basis vector has length/norm 1.
Recall from Section 2.6.1 that we can use Gaussian elimination to ﬁnd a
basis for a vector space spanned by a set of vectors. Assume we are given
a set {˜b1, . . . , ˜bn} of non-orthogonal and unnormalized basis vectors. We
concatenate them into a matrix ˜B = [˜b1, . . . , ˜bn] and apply Gaussian elim-
ination to the augmented matrix (Section 2.3.2) [ ˜B ˜B
⊤| ˜B] to obtain an
orthonormal basis. This constructive way to iteratively build an orthonor-
mal basis {b1, . . . , bn} is called the Gram-Schmidt process (Strang, 2003).
Example 3.8 (Orthonormal Basis)
The canonical/standard basis for a Euclidean vector space Rn is an or-
thonormal basis, where the inner product is the dot product of vectors.

1 b2 = 0 and ∥b1∥= 1 = ∥b2∥.
We will exploit the concept of an orthonormal basis in Chapter 12 and
Chapter 10 when we discuss support vector machines and principal com-
ponent analysis.
3.6 Orthogonal Complement
Having deﬁned orthogonality, we will now look at vector spaces that are
orthogonal to each other. This will play an important role in Chapter 10,

spective.

space U ⊆V . Then its orthogonal complement U ⊥is a (D−M)-dimensional

Therefore, the orthogonal complement can also be used to describe a

More speciﬁcally, the vector w with ∥w∥= 1, which is orthogonal to the
plane U, is the basis vector of U ⊥. Figure 3.7 illustrates this setting. All
vectors that are orthogonal to w must (by construction) lie in the plane
U. The vector w is called the normal vector of U.

Generally, orthogonal complements can be used to describe hyperplanes
in n-dimensional vector and afﬁne spaces.
3.7 Inner Product of Functions
Thus far, we looked at properties of inner products to compute lengths,
angles and distances. We focused on inner products of ﬁnite-dimensional
vectors. In the following, we will look at an example of inner products of
a different type of vectors: inner products of functions.
The inner products we discussed so far were deﬁned for vectors with a
ﬁnite number of entries. We can think of a vector x ∈Rn as a function
with n function values. The concept of an inner product can be generalized
to vectors with an inﬁnite number of entries (countably inﬁnite) and also
continuous-valued functions (uncountably inﬁnite). Then the sum over
individual components of vectors (see Equation (3.5) for example) turns
into an integral.
An inner product of two functions u : R →R and v : R →R can be
deﬁned as the deﬁnite integral
⟨u, v⟩:=

for lower and upper limits a, b < ∞, respectively. As with our usual inner
product, we can deﬁne norms and orthogonality by looking at the inner
product. If (3.37) evaluates to 0, the functions u and v are orthogonal. To
make the preceding inner product mathematically precise, we need to take
care of measures and the deﬁnition of integrals, leading to the deﬁnition of
a Hilbert space. Furthermore, unlike inner products on ﬁnite-dimensional
vectors, inner products on functions may diverge (have inﬁnite value). All
this requires diving into some more intricate details of real and functional
analysis, which we do not cover in this book.
Example 3.9 (Inner Product of Functions)

of (3.37), is shown in Figure 3.8. We see that this function is odd, i.e.,
f(−x) = −f(x). Therefore, the integral with limits a = −π, b = π of this
product evaluates to 0. Therefore, sin and cos are orthogonal functions.
Remark. It also holds that the collection of functions
{1, cos(x), cos(2x), cos(3x), . . . }
(3.38)
is orthogonal if we integrate from −π to π, i.e., any pair of functions are
orthogonal to each other. The collection of functions in (3.38) spans a
large subspace of the functions that are even and periodic on [−π, π), and
projecting functions onto this subspace is the fundamental idea behind
Fourier series.
♦
In Section 6.4.6, we will have a look at a second type of unconventional
inner products: the inner product of random variables.
3.8 Orthogonal Projections
Projections are an important class of linear transformations (besides rota-
tions and reﬂections) and play an important role in graphics, coding the-
ory, statistics and machine learning. In machine learning, we often deal
with data that is high-dimensional. High-dimensional data is often hard
to analyze or visualize. However, high-dimensional data quite often pos-
sesses the property that only a few dimensions contain most information,
and most other dimensions are not essential to describe key properties
of the data. When we compress or visualize high-dimensional data, we
will lose information. To minimize this compression loss, we ideally ﬁnd
the most informative dimensions in the data. As discussed in Chapter 1,
“Feature” is a
common expression

representation.
data can be represented as vectors, and in this chapter, we will discuss
some of the fundamental tools for data compression. More speciﬁcally, we
can project the original high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional
feature space and work in this lower-dimensional space to learn more
about the dataset and extract relevant patterns. For example, machine

learning algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA) by Pear-
son (1901) and Hotelling (1933) and deep neural networks (e.g., deep
auto-encoders (Deng et al., 2010)), heavily exploit the idea of dimension-
ality reduction. In the following, we will focus on orthogonal projections,
which we will use in Chapter 10 for linear dimensionality reduction and
in Chapter 12 for classiﬁcation. Even linear regression, which we discuss
in Chapter 9, can be interpreted using orthogonal projections. For a given
lower-dimensional subspace, orthogonal projections of high-dimensional
data retain as much information as possible and minimize the difference/
error between the original data and the corresponding projection. An il-
lustration of such an orthogonal projection is given in Figure 3.9. Before
we detail how to obtain these projections, let us deﬁne what a projection
actually is.
Deﬁnition 3.10 (Projection). Let V be a vector space and U ⊆V a
subspace of V . A linear mapping π : V →U is called a projection if
projection
π2 = π ◦π = π.
Since linear mappings can be expressed by transformation matrices (see
Section 2.7), the preceding deﬁnition applies equally to a special kind
of transformation matrices, the projection matrices P π, which exhibit the
projection matrix
property that P 2
π = P π.
In the following, we will derive orthogonal projections of vectors in the
inner product space (Rn, ⟨·, ·⟩) onto subspaces. We will start with one-
dimensional subspaces, which are also called lines. If not mentioned oth-
line
erwise, we assume the dot product ⟨x, y⟩= x⊤y as the inner product.
3.8.1 Projection onto One-Dimensional Subspaces (Lines)
Assume we are given a line (one-dimensional subspace) through the ori-
gin with basis vector b ∈Rn. The line is a one-dimensional subspace
U ⊆Rn spanned by b. When we project x ∈Rn onto U, we seek the
vector πU(x) ∈U that is closest to x. Using geometric arguments, let

us characterize some properties of the projection πU(x) (Figure 3.10(a)
serves as an illustration):
The projection πU(x) is closest to x, where “closest” implies that the
distance ∥x−πU(x)∥is minimal. It follows that the segment πU(x)−x
from πU(x) to x is orthogonal to U, and therefore the basis vector b of
U. The orthogonality condition yields ⟨πU(x) −x, b⟩= 0 since angles
between vectors are deﬁned via the inner product.
λ is then the
coordinate of πU(x)
with respect to b.
The projection πU(x) of x onto U must be an element of U and, there-
fore, a multiple of the basis vector b that spans U. Hence, πU(x) = λb,
for some λ ∈R.
In the following three steps, we determine the coordinate λ, the projection
πU(x) ∈U, and the projection matrix P π that maps any x ∈Rn onto U:
1. Finding the coordinate λ. The orthogonality condition yields
⟨x −πU(x), b⟩= 0
πU(x)=λb
⇐⇒
⟨x −λb, b⟩= 0 .
(3.39)
We can now exploit the bilinearity of the inner product and arrive at
With a general inner
product, we get
λ = ⟨x, b⟩if
∥b∥= 1.
⟨x, b⟩−λ ⟨b, b⟩= 0 ⇐⇒λ = ⟨x, b⟩
⟨b, b⟩= ⟨b, x⟩
∥b∥2 .
(3.40)
In the last step, we exploited the fact that inner products are symmet-
ric. If we choose ⟨·, ·⟩to be the dot product, we obtain
λ = b⊤x
b⊤b = b⊤x
∥b∥2 .
(3.41)
If ∥b∥= 1, then the coordinate λ of the projection is given by b⊤x.

2. Finding the projection point πU(x) ∈U. Since πU(x) = λb, we imme-
diately obtain with (3.40) that
πU(x) = λb = ⟨x, b⟩
∥b∥2 b = b⊤x
∥b∥2 b ,
(3.42)
where the last equality holds for the dot product only. We can also
compute the length of πU(x) by means of Deﬁnition 3.1 as
∥πU(x)∥= ∥λb∥= |λ| ∥b∥.
(3.43)
Hence, our projection is of length |λ| times the length of b. This also
adds the intuition that λ is the coordinate of πU(x) with respect to the
basis vector b that spans our one-dimensional subspace U.
If we use the dot product as an inner product, we get

∥b∥2 = | cos ω| ∥x∥.
(3.44)
Here, ω is the angle between x and b. This equation should be familiar
from trigonometry: If ∥x∥= 1, then x lies on the unit circle. It follows
that the projection onto the horizontal axis spanned by b is exactly

cos ω, and the length of the corresponding vector πU(x) = |cos ω|. An
illustration is given in Figure 3.10(b).
3. Finding the projection matrix P π. We know that a projection is a lin-
ear mapping (see Deﬁnition 3.10). Therefore, there exists a projection
matrix P π, such that πU(x) = P πx. With the dot product as inner
product and
πU(x) = λb = bλ = b b⊤x
∥b∥2 = bb⊤
∥b∥2 x ,
(3.45)
we immediately see that
P π = bb⊤
∥b∥2 .

Note that bb⊤(and, consequently, P π) is a symmetric matrix (of rank

1), and ∥b∥2 = ⟨b, b⟩is a scalar.
The projection matrix P π projects any vector x ∈Rn onto the line through
the origin with direction b (equivalently, the subspace U spanned by b).
Remark. The projection πU(x) ∈Rn is still an n-dimensional vector and
not a scalar. However, we no longer require n coordinates to represent the
projection, but only a single one if we want to express it with respect to

Note that the application of P π to πU(x) does not change anything, i.e.,
P ππU(x) = πU(x). This is expected because according to Deﬁnition 3.10,
we know that a projection matrix P π satisﬁes P 2
πx = P πx for all x.
Remark. With the results from Chapter 4, we can show that πU(x) is an
eigenvector of P π, and the corresponding eigenvalue is 1.

3.8.2 Projection onto General Subspaces
If U is given by a set
of spanning vectors,
which are not a
basis, make sure
you determine a
basis b1, . . . , bm
before proceeding.
In the following, we look at orthogonal projections of vectors x ∈Rn
onto lower-dimensional subspaces U ⊆Rn with dim(U) = m ⩾1. An
illustration is given in Figure 3.11.
Assume that (b1, . . . , bm) is an ordered basis of U. Any projection πU(x)
onto U is necessarily an element of U. Therefore, they can be represented

as linear combinations of the basis vectors b1, . . . , bm of U, such that
πU(x) = Pm
i=1 λibi.
The basis vectors
form the columns of
B ∈Rn×m, where
B = [b1, . . . , bm].
As in the 1D case, we follow a three-step procedure to ﬁnd the projec-
tion πU(x) and the projection matrix P π:
1. Find the coordinates λ1, . . . , λm of the projection (with respect to the
basis of U), such that the linear combination
πU(x) =

λibi = Bλ ,
(3.49)
B = [b1, . . . , bm] ∈Rn×m,
λ = [λ1, . . . , λm]⊤∈Rm ,
(3.50)
is closest to x ∈Rn. As in the 1D case, “closest” means “minimum
distance”, which implies that the vector connecting πU(x) ∈U and
x ∈Rn must be orthogonal to all basis vectors of U. Therefore, we
obtain m simultaneous conditions (assuming the dot product as the
inner product)
⟨b1, x −πU(x)⟩= b⊤
1 (x −πU(x)) = 0
(3.51)
...
⟨bm, x −πU(x)⟩= b⊤
m(x −πU(x)) = 0
(3.52)
which, with πU(x) = Bλ, can be written as
b⊤
1 (x −Bλ) = 0
(3.53)

m(x −Bλ) = 0

⇐⇒B⊤Bλ = B⊤x .
(3.56)
The last expression is called normal equation. Since b1, . . . , bm are a
normal equation
basis of U and, therefore, linearly independent, B⊤B ∈Rm×m is reg-
ular and can be inverted. This allows us to solve for the coefﬁcients/
coordinates
λ = (B⊤B)−1B⊤x .
(3.57)
The matrix (B⊤B)−1B⊤is also called the pseudo-inverse of B, which
pseudo-inverse
can be computed for non-square matrices B. It only requires that B⊤B
is positive deﬁnite, which is the case if B is full rank. In practical ap-
plications (e.g., linear regression), we often add a “jitter term” ϵI to

ness. This “ridge” can be rigorously derived using Bayesian inference.
See Chapter 9 for details.
2. Find the projection πU(x) ∈U. We already established that πU(x) =
Bλ. Therefore, with (3.57)
πU(x) = B(B⊤B)−1B⊤x .
(3.58)
3. Find the projection matrix P π. From (3.58), we can immediately see
that the projection matrix that solves P πx = πU(x) must be
P π = B(B⊤B)−1B⊤.
(3.59)
Remark. The solution for projecting onto general subspaces includes the
1D case as a special case: If dim(U) = 1, then B⊤B ∈R is a scalar and
we can rewrite the projection matrix in (3.59) P π = B(B⊤B)−1B⊤as
P π = BB⊤
B⊤B, which is exactly the projection matrix in (3.46).

To verify the results, we can (a) check whether the displacement vector

Remark. The projections πU(x) are still vectors in Rn although they lie in
an m-dimensional subspace U ⊆Rn. However, to represent a projected
vector we only need the m coordinates λ1, . . . , λm with respect to the
basis vectors b1, . . . , bm of U.
♦
Remark. In vector spaces with general inner products, we have to pay
attention when computing angles and distances, which are deﬁned by
means of the inner product.
♦
We can ﬁnd
approximate
solutions to
unsolvable linear
equation systems
using projections.
Projections allow us to look at situations where we have a linear system
Ax = b without a solution. Recall that this means that b does not lie in
the span of A, i.e., the vector b does not lie in the subspace spanned by
the columns of A. Given that the linear equation cannot be solved exactly,
we can ﬁnd an approximate solution. The idea is to ﬁnd the vector in the
subspace spanned by the columns of A that is closest to b, i.e., we compute
the orthogonal projection of b onto the subspace spanned by the columns
of A. This problem arises often in practice, and the solution is called the
least-squares solution (assuming the dot product as the inner product) of
least-squares
solution
an overdetermined system. This is discussed further in Section 9.4. Using
reconstruction errors (3.63) is one possible approach to derive principal
component analysis (Section 10.3).
Remark. We just looked at projections of vectors x onto a subspace U with
basis vectors {b1, . . . , bk}. If this basis is an ONB, i.e., (3.33) and (3.34)
are satisﬁed, the projection equation (3.58) simpliﬁes greatly to
πU(x) = BB⊤x
(3.65)
since B⊤B = I with coordinates
λ = B⊤x .
(3.66)
This means that we no longer have to compute the inverse from (3.58),
which saves computation time.

3.8 Orthogonal Projections

3.8.3 Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization
Projections are at the core of the Gram-Schmidt method that allows us to
constructively transform any basis (b1, . . . , bn) of an n-dimensional vector
space V into an orthogonal/orthonormal basis (u1, . . . , un) of V . This
basis always exists (Liesen and Mehrmann, 2015) and span[b1, . . . , bn] =
span[u1, . . . , un]. The Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization method iteratively
Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization
constructs an orthogonal basis (u1, . . . , un) from any basis (b1, . . . , bn) of
V as follows:
u1 := b1
(3.67)
uk := bk −πspan[u1,...,uk−1](bk) ,
k = 2, . . . , n .
(3.68)
In (3.68), the kth basis vector bk is projected onto the subspace spanned
by the ﬁrst k −1 constructed orthogonal vectors u1, . . . , uk−1; see Sec-
tion 3.8.2. This projection is then subtracted from bk and yields a vector
uk that is orthogonal to the (k −1)-dimensional subspace spanned by
u1, . . . , uk−1. Repeating this procedure for all n basis vectors b1, . . . , bn
yields an orthogonal basis (u1, . . . , un) of V . If we normalize the uk, we
obtain an ONB where ∥uk∥= 1 for k = 1, . . . , n.

3.8.4 Projection onto Afﬁne Subspaces
Thus far, we discussed how to project a vector onto a lower-dimensional
subspace U. In the following, we provide a solution to projecting a vector
onto an afﬁne subspace.
Consider the setting in Figure 3.13(a). We are given an afﬁne space L =
x0 + U, where b1, b2 are basis vectors of U. To determine the orthogonal
projection πL(x) of x onto L, we transform the problem into a problem
that we know how to solve: the projection onto a vector subspace. In
order to get there, we subtract the support point x0 from x and from L,
so that L −x0 = U is exactly the vector subspace U. We can now use the
orthogonal projections onto a subspace we discussed in Section 3.8.2 and
obtain the projection πU(x −x0), which is illustrated in Figure 3.13(b).
This projection can now be translated back into L by adding x0, such that
we obtain the orthogonal projection onto an afﬁne space L as
πL(x) = x0 + πU(x −x0) ,
(3.72)
where πU(·) is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace U, i.e., the
direction space of L; see Figure 3.13(c).
From Figure 3.13, it is also evident that the distance of x from the afﬁne
space L is identical to the distance of x −x0 from U, i.e.,
d(x, L) = ∥x −πL(x)∥= ∥x −(x0 + πU(x −x0))∥
(3.73a)
= d(x −x0, πU(x −x0)) = d(x −x0, U) .
(3.73b)
We will use projections onto an afﬁne subspace to derive the concept of
a separating hyperplane in Section 12.1.

3.9 Rotations
Length and angle preservation, as discussed in Section 3.4, are the two
characteristics of linear mappings with orthogonal transformation matri-
ces. In the following, we will have a closer look at speciﬁc orthogonal
transformation matrices, which describe rotations.
A rotation is a linear mapping (more speciﬁcally, an automorphism of
rotation
a Euclidean vector space) that rotates a plane by an angle θ about the
origin, i.e., the origin is a ﬁxed point. For a positive angle θ > 0, by com-
mon convention, we rotate in a counterclockwise direction. An example is
shown in Figure 3.14, where the transformation matrix is
R =

(3.74)
Important application areas of rotations include computer graphics and
robotics. For example, in robotics, it is often important to know how to
rotate the joints of a robotic arm in order to pick up or place an object,
see Figure 3.15.

of R2, which deﬁnes
the standard coordinate system in R2. We aim to rotate this coordinate
system by an angle θ as illustrated in Figure 3.16. Note that the rotated
vectors are still linearly independent and, therefore, are a basis of R2. This
means that the rotation performs a basis change.
Rotations Φ are linear mappings so that we can express them by a
rotation matrix R(θ). Trigonometry (see Figure 3.16) allows us to de-
rotation matrix
termine the coordinates of the rotated axes (the image of Φ) with respect
to the standard basis in R2. We obtain

3.9.2 Rotations in R3
In contrast to the R2 case, in R3 we can rotate any two-dimensional plane
about a one-dimensional axis. The easiest way to specify the general rota-
tion matrix is to specify how the images of the standard basis e1, e2, e3 are
supposed to be rotated, and making sure these images Re1, Re2, Re3 are
orthonormal to each other. We can then obtain a general rotation matrix
R by combining the images of the standard basis.
To have a meaningful rotation angle, we have to deﬁne what “coun-
terclockwise” means when we operate in more than two dimensions. We
use the convention that a “counterclockwise” (planar) rotation about an
axis refers to a rotation about an axis when we look at the axis “head on,
from the end toward the origin”. In R3, there are therefore three (planar)
rotations about the three standard basis vectors (see Figure 3.17):

3.9.3 Rotations in n Dimensions
The generalization of rotations from 2D and 3D to n-dimensional Eu-
clidean vector spaces can be intuitively described as ﬁxing n −2 dimen-
sions and restrict the rotation to a two-dimensional plane in the n-dimen-
sional space. As in the three-dimensional case, we can rotate any plane
(two-dimensional subspace of Rn).

rji = sin θ ,
rjj = cos θ .
(3.81)
In two dimensions (i.e., n = 2), we obtain (3.76) as a special case.
3.9.4 Properties of Rotations
Rotations exhibit a number of useful properties, which can be derived by
considering them as orthogonal matrices (Deﬁnition 3.8):
Rotations preserve distances, i.e., ∥x−y∥= ∥Rθ(x)−Rθ(y)∥. In other
words, rotations leave the distance between any two points unchanged
after the transformation.
Rotations preserve angles, i.e., the angle between Rθx and Rθy equals
the angle between x and y.
Rotations in three (or more) dimensions are generally not commuta-
tive. Therefore, the order in which rotations are applied is important,
even if they rotate about the same point. Only in two dimensions vector
rotations are commutative, such that R(φ)R(θ) = R(θ)R(φ) for all
φ, θ ∈[0, 2π). They form an Abelian group (with multiplication) only if
they rotate about the same point (e.g., the origin).
3.10 Further Reading
In this chapter, we gave a brief overview of some of the important concepts
of analytic geometry, which we will use in later chapters of the book.
For a broader and more in-depth overview of some of the concepts we
presented, we refer to the following excellent books: Axler (2015) and
Boyd and Vandenberghe (2018).
Inner products allow us to determine speciﬁc bases of vector (sub)spaces,
where each vector is orthogonal to all others (orthogonal bases) using the
Gram-Schmidt method. These bases are important in optimization and
numerical algorithms for solving linear equation systems. For instance,
Krylov subspace methods, such as conjugate gradients or the generalized
minimal residual method (GMRES), minimize residual errors that are or-
thogonal to each other (Stoer and Burlirsch, 2002).
In machine learning, inner products are important in the context of
Draft (2021-01-14) of “Mathematics for Machine Learning”. Feedback: https://mml-book.com.

3.10 Further Reading
95
kernel methods (Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2002). Kernel methods exploit the
fact that many linear algorithms can be expressed purely by inner prod-
uct computations. Then, the “kernel trick” allows us to compute these
inner products implicitly in a (potentially inﬁnite-dimensional) feature
space, without even knowing this feature space explicitly. This allowed the
“non-linearization” of many algorithms used in machine learning, such as
kernel-PCA (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1997) for dimensionality reduction. Gaus-
sian processes (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) also fall into the category
of kernel methods and are the current state of the art in probabilistic re-
gression (ﬁtting curves to data points). The idea of kernels is explored
further in Chapter 12.
Projections are often used in computer graphics, e.g., to generate shad-
ows. In optimization, orthogonal projections are often used to (iteratively)
minimize residual errors. This also has applications in machine learning,
e.g., in linear regression where we want to ﬁnd a (linear) function that
minimizes the residual errors, i.e., the lengths of the orthogonal projec-
tions of the data onto the linear function (Bishop, 2006). We will investi-
gate this further in Chapter 9. PCA (Pearson, 1901; Hotelling, 1933) also
uses projections to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data.
We will discuss this in more detail in Chapter 10.

Matrix Decompositions
In Chapters 2 and 3, we studied ways to manipulate and measure vectors,
projections of vectors, and linear mappings. Mappings and transforma-
tions of vectors can be conveniently described as operations performed by
matrices. Moreover, data is often represented in matrix form as well, e.g.,
where the rows of the matrix represent different people and the columns
describe different features of the people, such as weight, height, and socio-
economic status. In this chapter, we present three aspects of matrices: how
to summarize matrices, how matrices can be decomposed, and how these
decompositions can be used for matrix approximations.
We ﬁrst consider methods that allow us to describe matrices with just
a few numbers that characterize the overall properties of matrices. We
will do this in the sections on determinants (Section 4.1) and eigenval-
ues (Section 4.2) for the important special case of square matrices. These
characteristic numbers have important mathematical consequences and
allow us to quickly grasp what useful properties a matrix has. From here
we will proceed to matrix decomposition methods: An analogy for ma-
trix decomposition is the factoring of numbers, such as the factoring of
21 into prime numbers 7 · 3. For this reason matrix decomposition is also
often referred to as matrix factorization. Matrix decompositions are used
matrix factorization
to describe a matrix by means of a different representation using factors
of interpretable matrices.
We will ﬁrst cover a square-root-like operation for symmetric, positive
deﬁnite matrices, the Cholesky decomposition (Section 4.3). From here
we will look at two related methods for factorizing matrices into canoni-
cal forms. The ﬁrst one is known as matrix diagonalization (Section 4.4),
which allows us to represent the linear mapping using a diagonal trans-
formation matrix if we choose an appropriate basis. The second method,
singular value decomposition (Section 4.5), extends this factorization to
non-square matrices, and it is considered one of the fundamental concepts
in linear algebra. These decompositions are helpful, as matrices represent-
ing numerical data are often very large and hard to analyze. We conclude
the chapter with a systematic overview of the types of matrices and the
characteristic properties that distinguish them in the form of a matrix tax-
onomy (Section 4.7).
The methods that we cover in this chapter will become important in

Determinants are important concepts in linear algebra. A determinant is
a mathematical object in the analysis and solution of systems of linear
equations. Determinants are only deﬁned for square matrices A ∈Rn×n,
i.e., matrices with the same number of rows and columns. In this book,

Matrix Decompositions
onto a real number. Before providing a deﬁnition of the determinant for
general n × n matrices, let us have a look at some motivating examples,
and deﬁne determinants for some special matrices.
Example 4.1 (Testing for Matrix Invertibility)
Let us begin with exploring if a square matrix A is invertible (see Sec-
tion 2.2.2). For the smallest cases, we already know when a matrix
is invertible. If A is a 1 × 1 matrix, i.e., it is a scalar number, then
A = a =⇒A−1 = 1
a. Thus a 1
a = 1 holds, if and only if a ̸= 0.
For 2 × 2 matrices, by the deﬁnition of the inverse (Deﬁnition 2.3), we
know that AA−1 = I. Then, with (2.24), the inverse of A is
A−1 =
1
a11a22 −a12a21
 a22
−a12
−a21
a11

.
(4.2)
Hence, A is invertible if and only if
a11a22 −a12a21 ̸= 0 .
(4.3)
This quantity is the determinant of A ∈R2×2, i.e.,
det(A) =

a11
a12
a21
a22
 = a11a22 −a12a21 .
(4.4)
Example 4.1 points already at the relationship between determinants
and the existence of inverse matrices. The next theorem states the same
result for n × n matrices.
Theorem 4.1. For any square matrix A ∈Rn×n it holds that A is invertible
if and only if det(A) ̸= 0.
We have explicit (closed-form) expressions for determinants of small
matrices in terms of the elements of the matrix. For n = 1,
det(A) = det(a11) = a11 .

For n = 2,
det(A) =

For a memory aid of the product terms in Sarrus’ rule, try tracing the
elements of the triple products in the matrix.
We call a square matrix T an upper-triangular matrix if Tij = 0 for

matrix
i > j, i.e., the matrix is zero below its diagonal. Analogously, we deﬁne a
lower-triangular matrix as a matrix with zeros above its diagonal. For a tri-

Example 4.2 (Determinants as Measures of Volume)
The notion of a determinant is natural when we consider it as a mapping
from a set of n vectors spanning an object in Rn. It turns out that the de-
terminant det(A) is the signed volume of an n-dimensional parallelepiped
formed by columns of the matrix A.
For n = 2, the columns of the matrix form a parallelogram; see Fig-
ure 4.2. As the angle between vectors gets smaller, the area of a parallel-
ogram shrinks, too. Consider two vectors b, g that form the columns of a
matrix A = [b, g]. Then, the absolute value of the determinant of A is the
area of the parallelogram with vertices 0, b, g, b + g. In particular, if b, g
are linearly dependent so that b = λg for some λ ∈R, they no longer
form a two-dimensional parallelogram. Therefore, the corresponding area
is 0. On the contrary, if b, g are linearly independent and are multiples of
the canonical basis vectors e1, e2 then they can be written as b =


and
g =

, and the determinant is

b

g
 = bg −0 = bg.
The sign of the determinant indicates the orientation of the spanning
vectors b, g with respect to the standard basis (e1, e2). In our ﬁgure, ﬂip-
ping the order to g, b swaps the columns of A and reverses the orientation
of the shaded area. This becomes the familiar formula: area = height ×
length. This intuition extends to higher dimensions. In R3, we consider
three vectors r, b, g ∈R3 spanning the edges of a parallelepiped, i.e., a
solid with faces that are parallel parallelograms (see Figure 4.3). The ab-

solute value of the determinant of the 3 × 3 matrix [r, b, g] is the volume
of the solid. Thus, the determinant acts as a function that measures the
signed volume formed by column vectors composed in a matrix.

Computing the determinant of an n × n matrix requires a general algo-
rithm to solve the cases for n > 3, which we are going to explore in the fol-
lowing. Theorem 4.2 below reduces the problem of computing the deter-
minant of an n×n matrix to computing the determinant of (n−1)×(n−1)
matrices. By recursively applying the Laplace expansion (Theorem 4.2),
we can therefore compute determinants of n × n matrices by ultimately
computing determinants of 2 × 2 matrices.
Laplace expansion
Theorem 4.2 (Laplace Expansion). Consider a matrix A ∈Rn×n. Then,
for all j = 1, . . . , n:

4.1 Determinant and Trace
103
We use (4.6) to compute the determinants of all 2×2 matrices and obtain
det(A) = 1(1 −0) −2(3 −0) + 3(0 −0) = −5 .
(4.16)
For completeness we can compare this result to computing the determi-
nant using Sarrus’ rule (4.7):
det(A) = 1·1·1+3·0·3+0·2·2−0·1·3−1·0·2−3·2·1 = 1−6 = −5 . (4.17)
For A ∈Rn×n the determinant exhibits the following properties:
The determinant of a matrix product is the product of the corresponding
determinants, det(AB) = det(A)det(B).
Determinants are invariant to transposition, i.e., det(A) = det(A⊤).
If A is regular (invertible), then det(A−1) =
1
det(A).
Similar matrices (Deﬁnition 2.22) possess the same determinant. There-
fore, for a linear mapping Φ : V →V all transformation matrices AΦ
of Φ have the same determinant. Thus, the determinant is invariant to
the choice of basis of a linear mapping.
Adding a multiple of a column/row to another one does not change
det(A).
Multiplication of a column/row with λ ∈R scales det(A) by λ. In
particular, det(λA) = λn det(A).
Swapping two rows/columns changes the sign of det(A).
Because of the last three properties, we can use Gaussian elimination (see
Section 2.1) to compute det(A) by bringing A into row-echelon form.
We can stop Gaussian elimination when we have A in a triangular form
where the elements below the diagonal are all 0. Recall from (4.8) that the
determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the diagonal elements.
Theorem 4.3. A square matrix A ∈Rn×n has det(A) ̸= 0 if and only if
rk(A) = n. In other words, A is invertible if and only if it is full rank.
When mathematics was mainly performed by hand, the determinant
calculation was considered an essential way to analyze matrix invertibil-
ity. However, contemporary approaches in machine learning use direct
numerical methods that superseded the explicit calculation of the deter-
minant. For example, in Chapter 2, we learned that inverse matrices can
be computed by Gaussian elimination. Gaussian elimination can thus be
used to compute the determinant of a matrix.
Determinants will play an important theoretical role for the following
sections, especially when we learn about eigenvalues and eigenvectors
(Section 4.2) through the characteristic polynomial.
Deﬁnition 4.4. The trace of a square matrix A ∈Rn×n is deﬁned as
trace

Matrix Decompositions
tr(A) :=

X
i=1
aii ,
(4.18)
i.e. , the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements of A.
The trace satisﬁes the following properties:
tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B) for A, B ∈Rn×n
tr(αA) = αtr(A) , α ∈R for A ∈Rn×n
tr(In) = n
tr(AB) = tr(BA) for A ∈Rn×k, B ∈Rk×n
It can be shown that only one function satisﬁes these four properties to-
gether – the trace (Gohberg et al., 2012).
The properties of the trace of matrix products are more general. Specif-
ically, the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, i.e.,
The trace is
invariant under
cyclic permutations.
tr(AKL) = tr(KLA)
(4.19)
for matrices A ∈Ra×k, K ∈Rk×l, L ∈Rl×a. This property generalizes to
products of an arbitrary number of matrices. As a special case of (4.19), it
follows that for two vectors x, y ∈Rn
tr(xy⊤) = tr(y⊤x) = y⊤x ∈R .
(4.20)
Given a linear mapping Φ : V →V , where V is a vector space, we
deﬁne the trace of this map by using the trace of matrix representation
of Φ. For a given basis of V , we can describe Φ by means of the transfor-
mation matrix A. Then the trace of Φ is the trace of A. For a different
basis of V , it holds that the corresponding transformation matrix B of Φ
can be obtained by a basis change of the form S−1AS for suitable S (see
Section 2.7.2). For the corresponding trace of Φ, this means
tr(B) = tr(S−1AS)
(4.19)
=
tr(ASS−1) = tr(A) .
(4.21)
Hence, while matrix representations of linear mappings are basis depen-
dent the trace of a linear mapping Φ is independent of the basis.
In this section, we covered determinants and traces as functions char-
acterizing a square matrix. Taking together our understanding of determi-
nants and traces we can now deﬁne an important equation describing a
matrix A in terms of a polynomial, which we will use extensively in the
following sections.

The characteristic polynomial (4.22a) will allow us to compute eigen-
values and eigenvectors, covered in the next section.
4.2 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
We will now get to know a new way to characterize a matrix and its associ-
ated linear mapping. Recall from Section 2.7.1 that every linear mapping
has a unique transformation matrix given an ordered basis. We can in-
terpret linear mappings and their associated transformation matrices by
performing an “eigen” analysis. As we will see, the eigenvalues of a lin-

ear mapping will tell us how a special set of vectors, the eigenvectors, is
transformed by the linear mapping.
Deﬁnition 4.6. Let A ∈Rn×n be a square matrix. Then λ ∈R is an
eigenvalue of A and x ∈Rn\{0} is the corresponding eigenvector of A if

We call (4.25) the eigenvalue equation.

Remark. In the linear algebra literature and software, it is often a conven-
tion that eigenvalues are sorted in descending order, so that the largest
eigenvalue and associated eigenvector are called the ﬁrst eigenvalue and
its associated eigenvector, and the second largest called the second eigen-
value and its associated eigenvector, and so on. However, textbooks and
publications may have different or no notion of orderings. We do not want
to presume an ordering in this book if not stated explicitly.
♦
The following statements are equivalent:
λ is an eigenvalue of A ∈Rn×n.
There exists an x ∈Rn\{0} with Ax = λx, or equivalently, (A −
λIn)x = 0 can be solved non-trivially, i.e., x ̸= 0.
rk(A −λIn) < n.
det(A −λIn) = 0.
Deﬁnition 4.7 (Collinearity and Codirection). Two vectors that point in
the same direction are called codirected. Two vectors are collinear if they

point in the same or the opposite direction.
Remark (Non-uniqueness of eigenvectors). If x is an eigenvector of A
associated with eigenvalue λ, then for any c ∈R\{0} it holds that cx is
an eigenvector of A with the same eigenvalue since
A(cx) = cAx = cλx = λ(cx) .
(4.26)
Thus, all vectors that are collinear to x are also eigenvectors of A.

of Rn, which is called the eigenspace of A with respect to λ and is denoted

by Eλ. The set of all eigenvalues of A is called the eigenspectrum, or just

spectrum, of A.

If λ is an eigenvalue of A ∈Rn×n, then the corresponding eigenspace
Eλ is the solution space of the homogeneous system of linear equations
(A−λI)x = 0. Geometrically, the eigenvector corresponding to a nonzero
eigenvalue points in a direction that is stretched by the linear mapping.
The eigenvalue is the factor by which it is stretched. If the eigenvalue is
negative, the direction of the stretching is ﬂipped.
Example 4.4 (The Case of the Identity Matrix)
The identity matrix I ∈Rn×n has characteristic polynomial pI(λ) =
det(I −λI) = (1−λ)n = 0, which has only one eigenvalue λ = 1 that oc-
curs n times. Moreover, Ix = λx = 1x holds for all vectors x ∈Rn\{0}.
Because of this, the sole eigenspace E1 of the identity matrix spans n di-
mensions, and all n standard basis vectors of Rn are eigenvectors of I.
Useful properties regarding eigenvalues and eigenvectors include the
following:
A matrix A and its transpose A⊤possess the same eigenvalues, but not
necessarily the same eigenvectors.
The eigenspace Eλ is the null space of A −λI since
Ax = λx ⇐⇒Ax −λx = 0
(4.27a)
⇐⇒(A −λI)x = 0 ⇐⇒x ∈ker(A −λI).
(4.27b)
Similar matrices (see Deﬁnition 2.22) possess the same eigenvalues.
Therefore, a linear mapping Φ has eigenvalues that are independent of
the choice of basis of its transformation matrix. This makes eigenvalues,
together with the determinant and the trace, key characteristic param-
eters of a linear mapping as they are all invariant under basis change.
Symmetric, positive deﬁnite matrices always have positive, real eigen-
values.

Let us ﬁnd the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 2 × 2 matrix

(4.28)
Step 1: Characteristic Polynomial. From our deﬁnition of the eigen-
vector x ̸= 0 and eigenvalue λ of A, there will be a vector such that
Ax = λx, i.e., (A −λI)x = 0. Since x ̸= 0, this requires that the kernel
(null space) of A −λI contains more elements than just 0. This means
that A −λI is not invertible and therefore det(A −λI) = 0. Hence, we
need to compute the roots of the characteristic polynomial (4.22a) to ﬁnd
the eigenvalues.
Step 2: Eigenvalues. The characteristic polynomial is

giving the roots λ1 = 2 and λ2 = 5.
Step 3: Eigenvectors and Eigenspaces. We ﬁnd the eigenvectors that
correspond to these eigenvalues by looking at vectors x such that

The two eigenspaces E5 and E2 in Example 4.5 are one-dimensional
as they are each spanned by a single vector. However, in other cases
we may have multiple identical eigenvalues (see Deﬁnition 4.9) and the
eigenspace may have more than one dimension.
Deﬁnition 4.11. Let λi be an eigenvalue of a square matrix A. Then the
geometric multiplicity of λi is the number of linearly independent eigen-
geometric

vectors associated with λi. In other words, it is the dimensionality of the
eigenspace spanned by the eigenvectors associated with λi.
Remark. A speciﬁc eigenvalue’s geometric multiplicity must be at least
one because every eigenvalue has at least one associated eigenvector. An
eigenvalue’s geometric multiplicity cannot exceed its algebraic multiplic-
ity, but it may be lower.

Methods to analyze and learn from network data are an essential com-
ponent of machine learning methods. The key to understanding networks
is the connectivity between network nodes, especially if two nodes are
connected to each other or not. In data science applications, it is often
useful to study the matrix that captures this connectivity data.
We build a connectivity/adjacency matrix A ∈R277×277 of the complete
neural network of the worm C.Elegans. Each row/column represents one
of the 277 neurons of this worm’s brain. The connectivity matrix A has
a value of aij = 1 if neuron i talks to neuron j through a synapse, and
aij = 0 otherwise. The connectivity matrix is not symmetric, which im-
plies that eigenvalues may not be real valued. Therefore, we compute a
symmetrized version of the connectivity matrix as Asym := A + A⊤. This
new matrix Asym is shown in Figure 4.5(a) and has a nonzero value aij if
and only if two neurons are connected (white pixels), irrespective of the
direction of the connection. In Figure 4.5(b), we show the correspond-
ing eigenspectrum of Asym. The horizontal axis shows the index of the
eigenvalues, sorted in descending order. The vertical axis shows the corre-
sponding eigenvalue. The S-like shape of this eigenspectrum is typical for
many biological neural networks. The underlying mechanism responsible
for this is an area of active neuroscience research.

4.2 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
111
Theorem 4.12. The eigenvectors x1, . . . , xn of a matrix A ∈Rn×n with n
distinct eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λn are linearly independent.
This theorem states that eigenvectors of a matrix with n distinct eigen-
values form a basis of Rn.
Deﬁnition 4.13. A square matrix A ∈Rn×n is defective if it possesses
defective
fewer than n linearly independent eigenvectors.
A non-defective matrix A ∈Rn×n does not necessarily require n dis-
tinct eigenvalues, but it does require that the eigenvectors form a basis of
Rn. Looking at the eigenspaces of a defective matrix, it follows that the
sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is less than n. Speciﬁcally, a de-
fective matrix has at least one eigenvalue λi with an algebraic multiplicity
m > 1 and a geometric multiplicity of less than m.
Remark. A defective matrix cannot have n distinct eigenvalues, as distinct
eigenvalues have linearly independent eigenvectors (Theorem 4.12).
♦
Theorem 4.14. Given a matrix A ∈Rm×n, we can always obtain a sym-
metric, positive semideﬁnite matrix S ∈Rn×n by deﬁning
S := A⊤A .
(4.36)
Remark. If rk(A) = n, then S := A⊤A is symmetric, positive deﬁnite.
♦
Understanding why Theorem 4.14 holds is insightful for how we can
use symmetrized matrices: Symmetry requires S = S⊤, and by insert-
ing (4.36) we obtain S = A⊤A = A⊤(A⊤)⊤= (A⊤A)⊤= S⊤. More-
over, positive semideﬁniteness (Section 3.2.3) requires that x⊤Sx ⩾0
and inserting (4.36) we obtain x⊤Sx = x⊤A⊤Ax = (x⊤A⊤)(Ax) =
(Ax)⊤(Ax) ⩾0, because the dot product computes a sum of squares
(which are themselves non-negative).
spectral theorem
Theorem 4.15 (Spectral Theorem). If A ∈Rn×n is symmetric, there ex-
ists an orthonormal basis of the corresponding vector space V consisting of
eigenvectors of A, and each eigenvalue is real.
A direct implication of the spectral theorem is that the eigendecompo-
sition of a symmetric matrix A exists (with real eigenvalues), and that
we can ﬁnd an ONB of eigenvectors so that A = P DP ⊤, where D is
diagonal and the columns of P contain the eigenvectors.

Matrix Decompositions
The characteristic polynomial of A is
pA(λ) = −(λ −1)2(λ −7) ,
(4.38)
so that we obtain the eigenvalues λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 7, where λ1 is a
repeated eigenvalue. Following our standard procedure for computing
eigenvectors, we obtain the eigenspaces

(4.39)
We see that x3 is orthogonal to both x1 and x2. However, since x⊤
1 x2 =
1 ̸= 0, they are not orthogonal. The spectral theorem (Theorem 4.15)
states that there exists an orthogonal basis, but the one we have is not
orthogonal. However, we can construct one.
To construct such a basis, we exploit the fact that x1, x2 are eigenvec-
tors associated with the same eigenvalue λ. Therefore, for any α, β ∈R it
holds that
A(αx1 + βx2) = Ax1α + Ax2β = λ(αx1 + βx2) ,
(4.40)
i.e., any linear combination of x1 and x2 is also an eigenvector of A as-
sociated with λ. The Gram-Schmidt algorithm (Section 3.8.3) is a method
for iteratively constructing an orthogonal/orthonormal basis from a set of
basis vectors using such linear combinations. Therefore, even if x1 and x2
are not orthogonal, we can apply the Gram-Schmidt algorithm and ﬁnd
eigenvectors associated with λ1 = 1 that are orthogonal to each other
(and to x3). In our example, we will obtain

which are orthogonal to each other, orthogonal to x3, and eigenvectors of
A associated with λ1 = 1.
Before we conclude our considerations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors
it is useful to tie these matrix characteristics together with the concepts of
the determinant and the trace.

its eigenvalues, i.e.,

(4.43)
where λi ∈C are (possibly repeated) eigenvalues of A.
Let us provide a geometric intuition of these two theorems. Consider
a matrix A ∈R2×2 that possesses two linearly independent eigenvectors
x1, x2. For this example, we assume (x1, x2) are an ONB of R2 so that they
are orthogonal and the area of the square they span is 1; see Figure 4.6.
From Section 4.1, we know that the determinant computes the change of
area of unit square under the transformation A. In this example, we can
compute the change of area explicitly: Mapping the eigenvectors using
A gives us vectors v1 = Ax1 = λ1x1 and v2 = Ax2 = λ2x2, i.e., the
new vectors vi are scaled versions of the eigenvectors xi, and the scaling
factors are the corresponding eigenvalues λi. v1, v2 are still orthogonal,
and the area of the rectangle they span is |λ1λ2|.
Given that x1, x2 (in our example) are orthonormal, we can directly
compute the perimeter of the unit square as 2(1 + 1). Mapping the eigen-
vectors using A creates a rectangle whose perimeter is 2(|λ1| + |λ2|).
Therefore, the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues tells us how
the perimeter of the unit square changes under the transformation matrix
A.
Example 4.9 (Google’s PageRank – Webpages as Eigenvectors)
Google uses the eigenvector corresponding to the maximal eigenvalue of
a matrix A to determine the rank of a page for search. The idea for the
PageRank algorithm, developed at Stanford University by Larry Page and
Sergey Brin in 1996, was that the importance of any web page can be ap-
proximated by the importance of pages that link to it. For this, they write
down all web sites as a huge directed graph that shows which page links
to which. PageRank computes the weight (importance) xi ⩾0 of a web
site ai by counting the number of pages pointing to ai. Moreover, PageR-
ank takes into account the importance of the web sites that link to ai. The
navigation behavior of a user is then modeled by a transition matrix A of
this graph that tells us with what (click) probability somebody will end up

tial rank/importance vector x of a web site the sequence x, Ax, A2x, . . .
converges to a vector x∗. This vector is called the PageRank and satisﬁes
PageRank
Ax∗= x∗, i.e., it is an eigenvector (with corresponding eigenvalue 1) of
A. After normalizing x∗, such that ∥x∗∥= 1, we can interpret the entries
as probabilities. More details and different perspectives on PageRank can
be found in the original technical report (Page et al., 1999).
4.3 Cholesky Decomposition
There are many ways to factorize special types of matrices that we en-
counter often in machine learning. In the positive real numbers, we have
the square-root operation that gives us a decomposition of the number
into identical components, e.g., 9 = 3 · 3. For matrices, we need to be
careful that we compute a square-root-like operation on positive quanti-
ties. For symmetric, positive deﬁnite matrices (see Section 3.2.3), we can
choose from a number of square-root equivalent operations. The Cholesky

eration on symmetric, positive deﬁnite matrices that is useful in practice.

matrix A can be factorized into a product A = LL⊤, where L is a lower-

l31 = 1
l11
a31 ,
l32 = 1
l22

(4.48)
Thus, we constructed the Cholesky decomposition for any symmetric, pos-
itive deﬁnite 3 × 3 matrix. The key realization is that we can backward
calculate what the components lij for the L should be, given the values
aij for A and previously computed values of lij.
The Cholesky decomposition is an important tool for the numerical
computations underlying machine learning. Here, symmetric positive def-
inite matrices require frequent manipulation, e.g., the covariance matrix
of a multivariate Gaussian variable (see Section 6.5) is symmetric, positive
deﬁnite. The Cholesky factorization of this covariance matrix allows us to
generate samples from a Gaussian distribution. It also allows us to perform
a linear transformation of random variables, which is heavily exploited
when computing gradients in deep stochastic models, such as the varia-
tional auto-encoder (Jimenez Rezende et al., 2014; Kingma and Welling,
2014). The Cholesky decomposition also allows us to compute determi-
nants very efﬁciently. Given the Cholesky decomposition A = LL⊤, we
know that det(A) = det(L) det(L⊤) = det(L)2. Since L is a triangular
matrix, the determinant is simply the product of its diagonal entries so
that det(A) = Q
i l2
ii. Thus, many numerical software packages use the
Cholesky decomposition to make computations more efﬁcient.

They allow fast computation of determinants, powers, and inverses. The
determinant is the product of its diagonal entries, a matrix power Dk is
given by each diagonal element raised to the power k, and the inverse

Section 2.7.2 and eigenvalues from Section 4.2.
Recall that two matrices A, D are similar (Deﬁnition 2.22) if there ex-
ists an invertible matrix P , such that D = P −1AP . More speciﬁcally, we
will look at matrices A that are similar to diagonal matrices D that con-
tain the eigenvalues of A on the diagonal.
Deﬁnition 4.19 (Diagonalizable). A matrix A ∈Rn×n is diagonalizable
diagonalizable
if it is similar to a diagonal matrix, i.e., if there exists an invertible matrix
P ∈Rn×n such that D = P −1AP .
In the following, we will see that diagonalizing a matrix A ∈Rn×n is
a way of expressing the same linear mapping but in another basis (see
Section 2.6.1), which will turn out to be a basis that consists of the eigen-
vectors of A.
Let A ∈Rn×n, let λ1, . . . , λn be a set of scalars, and let p1, . . . , pn be a
set of vectors in Rn. We deﬁne P := [p1, . . . , pn] and let D ∈Rn×n be a
diagonal matrix with diagonal entries λ1, . . . , λn. Then we can show that
AP = P D
(4.50)
if and only if λ1, . . . , λn are the eigenvalues of A and p1, . . . , pn are cor-
responding eigenvectors of A.
We can see that this statement holds because
AP = A[p1, . . . , pn] = [Ap1, . . . , Apn] ,

(4.53)
...
Apn = λnpn .
(4.54)
Therefore, the columns of P must be eigenvectors of A.
Our deﬁnition of diagonalization requires that P ∈Rn×n is invertible,
i.e., P has full rank (Theorem 4.3). This requires us to have n linearly
independent eigenvectors p1, . . . , pn, i.e., the pi form a basis of Rn.
Theorem 4.20 (Eigendecomposition). A square matrix A ∈Rn×n can be
factored into
A = P DP −1 ,
(4.55)
where P ∈Rn×n and D is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are
the eigenvalues of A, if and only if the eigenvectors of A form a basis of Rn.

Theorem 4.20 implies that only non-defective matrices can be diagonal-
ized and that the columns of P are the n eigenvectors of A. For symmetric
matrices we can obtain even stronger outcomes for the eigenvalue decom-
position.
Theorem 4.21. A symmetric matrix S ∈Rn×n can always be diagonalized.
Theorem 4.21 follows directly from the spectral theorem 4.15. More-
over, the spectral theorem states that we can ﬁnd an ONB of eigenvectors
of Rn. This makes P an orthogonal matrix so that D = P ⊤AP .
Remark. The Jordan normal form of a matrix offers a decomposition that
works for defective matrices (Lang, 1987) but is beyond the scope of this
book.
♦
Geometric Intuition for the Eigendecomposition
We can interpret the eigendecomposition of a matrix as follows (see also
Figure 4.7): Let A be the transformation matrix of a linear mapping with
respect to the standard basis. P −1 performs a basis change from the stan-
dard basis into the eigenbasis. This identiﬁes the eigenvectors pi (blue and
orange arrows in Figure 4.7) onto the standard basis vectors ei. Then, the
diagonal D scales the vectors along these axes by the eigenvalues λi. Fi-
nally, P transforms these scaled vectors back into the standard/canonical
coordinates yielding λipi.

Diagonal matrices D can efﬁciently be raised to a power. Therefore,
we can ﬁnd a matrix power for a matrix A ∈Rn×n via the eigenvalue
decomposition (if it exists) so that

The eigenvalue decomposition requires square matrices. It would be
useful to perform a decomposition on general matrices. In the next sec-
tion, we introduce a more general matrix decomposition technique, the
singular value decomposition.
4.5 Singular Value Decomposition
The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix is a central matrix
decomposition method in linear algebra. It has been referred to as the
“fundamental theorem of linear algebra” (Strang, 1993) because it can be
applied to all matrices, not only to square matrices, and it always exists.
Moreover, as we will explore in the following, the SVD of a matrix A,
which represents a linear mapping Φ : V →W, quantiﬁes the change
between the underlying geometry of these two vector spaces. We recom-
mend the work by Kalman (1996) and Roy and Banerjee (2014) for a
deeper overview of the mathematics of the SVD.
SVD theorem
Theorem 4.22 (SVD Theorem). Let A ∈Rm×n be a rectangular matrix of
rank r ∈[0, min(m, n)]. The SVD of A is a decomposition of the form

and an orthogonal matrix V ∈Rn×n with column vectors vj, j = 1, . . . , n.
Moreover, Σ is an m × n matrix with Σii = σi ⩾0 and Σij = 0, i ̸= j.
The diagonal entries σi, i = 1, . . . , r, of Σ are called the singular values,

Observe that the Σ ∈Rm×n is rectangular. In particular, Σ is of the same
size as A. This means that Σ has a diagonal submatrix that contains the

then the matrix Σ has diagonal structure up to row n and then consists of

4.5.1 Geometric Intuitions for the SVD
The SVD offers geometric intuitions to describe a transformation matrix
A. In the following, we will discuss the SVD as sequential linear trans-
formations performed on the bases. In Example 4.12, we will then apply
transformation matrices of the SVD to a set of vectors in R2, which allows
us to visualize the effect of each transformation more clearly.
The SVD of a matrix can be interpreted as a decomposition of a corre-
sponding linear mapping (recall Section 2.7.1) Φ : Rn →Rm into three
operations; see Figure 4.8. The SVD intuition follows superﬁcially a simi-
lar structure to our eigendecomposition intuition, see Figure 4.7: Broadly
speaking, the SVD performs a basis change via V ⊤followed by a scal-
ing and augmentation (or reduction) in dimensionality via the singular

value matrix Σ. Finally, it performs a second basis change via U. The SVD
entails a number of important details and caveats, which is why we will
review our intuition in more detail.
It is useful to revise
basis changes
(Section 2.7.2),
orthogonal matrices
(Deﬁnition 3.8) and
orthonormal bases
(Section 3.5).
Assume we are given a transformation matrix of a linear mapping Φ :
Rn →Rm with respect to the standard bases B and C of Rn and Rm,
respectively. Moreover, assume a second basis ˜B of Rn and ˜C of Rm. Then
1. The matrix V performs a basis change in the domain Rn from ˜B (rep-
resented by the red and orange vectors v1 and v2 in the top-left of Fig-
ure 4.8) to the standard basis B. V ⊤= V −1 performs a basis change
from B to ˜B. The red and orange vectors are now aligned with the
canonical basis in the bottom-left of Figure 4.8.
2. Having changed the coordinate system to ˜B, Σ scales the new coordi-
nates by the singular values σi (and adds or deletes dimensions), i.e.,
Σ is the transformation matrix of Φ with respect to ˜B and ˜C, rep-
resented by the red and orange vectors being stretched and lying in
the e1-e2 plane, which is now embedded in a third dimension in the
bottom-right of Figure 4.8.
3. U performs a basis change in the codomain Rm from ˜C into the canoni-
cal basis of Rm, represented by a rotation of the red and orange vectors
out of the e1-e2 plane. This is shown in the top-right of Figure 4.8.
The SVD expresses a change of basis in both the domain and codomain.
This is in contrast with the eigendecomposition that operates within the
same vector space, where the same basis change is applied and then un-
done. What makes the SVD special is that these two different bases are
simultaneously linked by the singular value matrix Σ.
Example 4.12 (Vectors and the SVD)
Consider a mapping of a square grid of vectors X ∈R2 that ﬁt in a box of
size 2 × 2 centered at the origin. Using the standard basis, we map these
vectors using

The rotated vectors are shown in the bottom-left panel of Figure 4.9. We
now map these vectors using the singular value matrix Σ to the codomain
R3 (see the bottom-right panel in Figure 4.9). Note that all vectors lie in

plane have been stretched by the singular values.
The direct mapping of the vectors X by A to the codomain R3 equals
the transformation of X by UΣV ⊤, where U performs a rotation within
the codomain R3 so that the mapped vectors are no longer restricted to
the x1-x2 plane; they still are on a plane as shown in the top-right panel
of Figure 4.9.

4.5.2 Construction of the SVD
We will next discuss why the SVD exists and show how to compute it
in detail. The SVD of a general matrix shares some similarities with the
eigendecomposition of a square matrix.

with the corresponding SVD
S = UΣV ⊤.
(4.69)
If we set
U = P = V ,
D = Σ ,
(4.70)
we see that the SVD of SPD matrices is their eigendecomposition.
♦
In the following, we will explore why Theorem 4.22 holds and how
the SVD is constructed. Computing the SVD of A ∈Rm×n is equivalent
to ﬁnding two sets of orthonormal bases U = (u1, . . . , um) and V =
(v1, . . . , vn) of the codomain Rm and the domain Rn, respectively. From
these ordered bases, we will construct the matrices U and V .
Our plan is to start with constructing the orthonormal set of right-
singular vectors v1, . . . , vn ∈Rn. We then construct the orthonormal set
of left-singular vectors u1, . . . , um ∈Rm. Thereafter, we will link the two
and require that the orthogonality of the vi is preserved under the trans-
formation of A. This is important because we know that the images Avi
form a set of orthogonal vectors. We will then normalize these images by
scalar factors, which will turn out to be the singular values.
Let us begin with constructing the right-singular vectors. The spectral
theorem (Theorem 4.15) tells us that the eigenvectors of a symmetric
matrix form an ONB, which also means it can be diagonalized. More-
over, from Theorem 4.14 we can always construct a symmetric, positive
semideﬁnite matrix A⊤A ∈Rn×n from any rectangular matrix A ∈
Rm×n. Thus, we can always diagonalize A⊤A and obtain
A⊤A = P DP ⊤= P

where P is an orthogonal matrix, which is composed of the orthonormal

SVD of A exists and inject (4.64) into (4.71). This yields
A⊤A = (UΣV ⊤)⊤(UΣV ⊤) = V Σ⊤U ⊤UΣV ⊤,
(4.72)
where U, V are orthogonal matrices. Therefore, with U ⊤U = I we ob-

Matrix Decompositions
Therefore, the eigenvectors of A⊤A that compose P are the right-singular
vectors V of A (see (4.74)). The eigenvalues of A⊤A are the squared
singular values of Σ (see (4.75)).
To obtain the left-singular vectors U, we follow a similar procedure.
We start by computing the SVD of the symmetric matrix AA⊤∈Rm×m
(instead of the previous A⊤A ∈Rn×n). The SVD of A yields
AA⊤= (UΣV ⊤)(UΣV ⊤)⊤= UΣV ⊤V Σ⊤U ⊤

(4.76b)
The spectral theorem tells us that AA⊤= SDS⊤can be diagonalized
and we can ﬁnd an ONB of eigenvectors of AA⊤, which are collected in
S. The orthonormal eigenvectors of AA⊤are the left-singular vectors U
and form an orthonormal basis in the codomain of the SVD.
This leaves the question of the structure of the matrix Σ. Since AA⊤
and A⊤A have the same nonzero eigenvalues (see page 106), the nonzero
entries of the Σ matrices in the SVD for both cases have to be the same.
The last step is to link up all the parts we touched upon so far. We have
an orthonormal set of right-singular vectors in V . To ﬁnish the construc-
tion of the SVD, we connect them with the orthonormal vectors U. To
reach this goal, we use the fact the images of the vi under A have to be
orthogonal, too. We can show this by using the results from Section 3.4.
We require that the inner product between Avi and Avj must be 0 for
i ̸= j. For any two orthogonal eigenvectors vi, vj, i ̸= j, it holds that
(Avi)⊤(Avj) = v⊤
i (A⊤A)vj = v⊤
i (λjvj) = λjv⊤
i vj = 0 .
(4.77)
For the case m ⩾r, it holds that {Av1, . . . , Avr} is a basis of an r-
dimensional subspace of Rm.
To complete the SVD construction, we need left-singular vectors that
are orthonormal: We normalize the images of the right-singular vectors
Avi and obtain
ui :=

∥Avi∥=

Avi = 1

Avi ,
(4.78)
where the last equality was obtained from (4.75) and (4.76b), showing
us that the eigenvalues of AA⊤are such that σ2
i = λi.
Therefore, the eigenvectors of A⊤A, which we know are the right-
singular vectors vi, and their normalized images under A, the left-singular
vectors ui, form two self-consistent ONBs that are connected through the
singular value matrix Σ.
Let us rearrange (4.78) to obtain the singular value equation

4.5 Singular Value Decomposition
125
This equation closely resembles the eigenvalue equation (4.25), but the
vectors on the left- and the right-hand sides are not the same.
For n < m, (4.79) holds only for i ⩽n, but (4.79) says nothing about
the ui for i > n. However, we know by construction that they are or-
thonormal. Conversely, for m < n, (4.79) holds only for i ⩽m. For i > m,
we have Avi = 0 and we still know that the vi form an orthonormal set.
This means that the SVD also supplies an orthonormal basis of the kernel
(null space) of A, the set of vectors x with Ax = 0 (see Section 2.7.3).
Concatenating the vi as the columns of V and the ui as the columns of
U yields
AV = UΣ ,
(4.80)
where Σ has the same dimensions as A and a diagonal structure for rows
1, . . . , r. Hence, right-multiplying with V ⊤yields A = UΣV ⊤, which is
the SVD of A.

Note that on a computer the approach illustrated here has poor numerical
behavior, and the SVD of A is normally computed without resorting to the
eigenvalue decomposition of A⊤A.
4.5.3 Eigenvalue Decomposition vs. Singular Value Decomposition
Let us consider the eigendecomposition A = P DP −1 and the SVD A =
UΣV ⊤and review the core elements of the past sections.
The SVD always exists for any matrix Rm×n. The eigendecomposition is
only deﬁned for square matrices Rn×n and only exists if we can ﬁnd a
basis of eigenvectors of Rn.
The vectors in the eigendecomposition matrix P are not necessarily
orthogonal, i.e., the change of basis is not a simple rotation and scaling.
On the other hand, the vectors in the matrices U and V in the SVD are
orthonormal, so they do represent rotations.
Both the eigendecomposition and the SVD are compositions of three
linear mappings:
1. Change of basis in the domain
2. Independent scaling of each new basis vector and mapping from do-
main to codomain
3. Change of basis in the codomain

A key difference between the eigendecomposition and the SVD is that
in the SVD, domain and codomain can be vector spaces of different
dimensions.
In the SVD, the left- and right-singular vector matrices U and V are
generally not inverse of each other (they perform basis changes in dif-
ferent vector spaces). In the eigendecomposition, the basis change ma-
trices P and P −1 are inverses of each other.
In the SVD, the entries in the diagonal matrix Σ are all real and non-
negative, which is not generally true for the diagonal matrix in the
eigendecomposition.
The SVD and the eigendecomposition are closely related through their
projections
– The left-singular vectors of A are eigenvectors of AA⊤
– The right-singular vectors of A are eigenvectors of A⊤A.
– The nonzero singular values of A are the square roots of the nonzero
eigenvalues of both AA⊤and A⊤A.
For symmetric matrices A ∈Rn×n, the eigenvalue decomposition and
the SVD are one and the same, which follows from the spectral theo-
rem 4.15.
Example 4.14 (Finding Structure in Movie Ratings and Consumers)
Let us add a practical interpretation of the SVD by analyzing data on
people and their preferred movies. Consider three viewers (Ali, Beatrix,
Chandra) rating four different movies (Star Wars, Blade Runner, Amelie,
Delicatessen). Their ratings are values between 0 (worst) and 5 (best) and
encoded in a data matrix A ∈R4×3 as shown in Figure 4.10. Each row
represents a movie and each column a user. Thus, the column vectors of
movie ratings, one for each viewer, are xAli, xBeatrix, xChandra.

Matrix Decompositions
Factoring A using the SVD offers us a way to capture the relationships
of how people rate movies, and especially if there is a structure linking
which people like which movies. Applying the SVD to our data matrix A
makes a number of assumptions:
1. All viewers rate movies consistently using the same linear mapping.
2. There are no errors or noise in the ratings.
3. We interpret the left-singular vectors ui as stereotypical movies and
the right-singular vectors vj as stereotypical viewers.
We then make the assumption that any viewer’s speciﬁc movie preferences
can be expressed as a linear combination of the vj. Similarly, any movie’s
like-ability can be expressed as a linear combination of the ui. Therefore,
a vector in the domain of the SVD can be interpreted as a viewer in the
“space” of stereotypical viewers, and a vector in the codomain of the SVD
correspondingly as a movie in the “space” of stereotypical movies. Let us

inspect the SVD of our movie-user matrix. The ﬁrst left-singular vector u1
has large absolute values for the two science ﬁction movies and a large
ﬁrst singular value (red shading in Figure 4.10). Thus, this groups a type
of users with a speciﬁc set of movies (science ﬁction theme). Similarly, the
ﬁrst right-singular v1 shows large absolute values for Ali and Beatrix, who
give high ratings to science ﬁction movies (green shading in Figure 4.10).
This suggests that v1 reﬂects the notion of a science ﬁction lover.
Similarly, u2, seems to capture a French art house ﬁlm theme, and v2
indicates that Chandra is close to an idealized lover of such movies. An
idealized science ﬁction lover is a purist and only loves science ﬁction
movies, so a science ﬁction lover v1 gives a rating of zero to everything
but science ﬁction themed – this logic is implied the diagonal substructure
for the singular value matrix Σ. A speciﬁc movie is therefore represented
by how it decomposes (linearly) into its stereotypical movies. Likewise, a
person would be represented by how they decompose (via linear combi-
nation) into movie themes.
It is worth, to brieﬂy discuss SVD terminology and conventions, as there
are different versions used in the literature. The mathematics remains in-
variant to these differences, but these differences can be confusing.
For convenience in notation and abstraction, we use an SVD notation
where the SVD is described as having two square left- and right-singular
vector matrices, but a non-square singular value matrix. Our deﬁni-
tion (4.64) for the SVD is sometimes called the full SVD.

gular matrices. Then, for A ∈Rm×n and m ⩾n,

4.6 Matrix Approximation
129
Sometimes this formulation is called the reduced SVD (e.g., Datta (2010))
reduced SVD
or the SVD (e.g., Press et al. (2007)). This alternative format changes
merely how the matrices are constructed but leaves the mathematical
structure of the SVD unchanged. The convenience of this alternative
formulation is that Σ is diagonal, as in the eigenvalue decomposition.
In Section 4.6, we will learn about matrix approximation techniques
using the SVD, which is also called the truncated SVD.
truncated SVD
It is possible to deﬁne the SVD of a rank-r matrix A so that U is an
m × r matrix, Σ a diagonal matrix r × r, and V an r × n matrix.
This construction is very similar to our deﬁnition, and ensures that the
diagonal matrix Σ has only nonzero entries along the diagonal. The
main convenience of this alternative notation is that Σ is diagonal, as
in the eigenvalue decomposition.
A restriction that the SVD for A only applies to m × n matrices with
m > n is practically unnecessary. When m < n, the SVD decomposition
will yield Σ with more zero columns than rows and, consequently, the
singular values σm+1, . . . , σn are 0.
The SVD is used in a variety of applications in machine learning from
least-squares problems in curve ﬁtting to solving systems of linear equa-
tions. These applications harness various important properties of the SVD,
its relation to the rank of a matrix, and its ability to approximate matrices
of a given rank with lower-rank matrices. Substituting a matrix with its
SVD has often the advantage of making calculation more robust to nu-
merical rounding errors. As we will explore in the next section, the SVD’s
ability to approximate matrices with “simpler” matrices in a principled
manner opens up machine learning applications ranging from dimension-
ality reduction and topic modeling to data compression and clustering.
4.6 Matrix Approximation
We considered the SVD as a way to factorize A = UΣV ⊤∈Rm×n into
the product of three matrices, where U ∈Rm×m and V ∈Rn×n are or-
thogonal and Σ contains the singular values on its main diagonal. Instead
of doing the full SVD factorization, we will now investigate how the SVD
allows us to represent a matrix A as a sum of simpler (low-rank) matrices
Ai, which lends itself to a matrix approximation scheme that is cheaper
to compute than the full SVD.
We construct a rank-1 matrix Ai ∈Rm×n as
Ai := uiv⊤
i ,
(4.90)
which is formed by the outer product of the ith orthogonal column vector
of U and V . Figure 4.11 shows an image of Stonehenge, which can be
represented by a matrix A ∈R1432×1910, and some outer products Ai, as
deﬁned in (4.90).

where the outer-product matrices Ai are weighted by the ith singular

vectors uiv⊤
i and scales them by the corresponding singular value σi. All
terms Σijuiv⊤
j vanish for i ̸= j because Σ is a diagonal matrix. Any terms

In (4.90), we introduced rank-1 matrices Ai. We summed up the r in-
dividual rank-1 matrices to obtain a rank-r matrix A; see (4.91). If the
sum does not run over all matrices Ai, i = 1, . . . , r, but only up to an
intermediate value k < r, we obtain a rank-k approximation

imation. While the original image requires 1, 432 · 1, 910 = 2, 735, 120
numbers, the rank-5 approximation requires us only to store the ﬁve sin-
gular values and the ﬁve left- and right-singular vectors (1, 432 and 1, 910-
dimensional each) for a total of 5·(1, 432+1, 910+1) = 16, 715 numbers
– just above 0.6% of the original.
To measure the difference (error) between A and its rank-k approxima-
tion bA(k), we need the notion of a norm. In Section 3.1, we already used

also deﬁne norms on matrices.

norm of a matrix A ∈Rm×n is deﬁned as
∥A∥2 := max

.
(4.93)
We introduce the notation of a subscript in the matrix norm (left-hand
side), similar to the Euclidean norm for vectors (right-hand side), which
has subscript 2. The spectral norm (4.93) determines how long any vector
x can at most become when multiplied by A.
Theorem 4.24. The spectral norm of A is its largest singular value σ1.
We leave the proof of this theorem as an exercise.

The Eckart-Young theorem states explicitly how much error we intro-
duce by approximating A using a rank-k approximation. We can inter-
pret the rank-k approximation obtained with the SVD as a projection of
the full-rank matrix A onto a lower-dimensional space of rank-at-most-k
matrices. Of all possible projections, the SVD minimizes the error (with
respect to the spectral norm) between A and any rank-k approximation.
We can retrace some of the steps to understand why (4.95) should hold.

the sum of the remaining rank-1 matrices
A −bA(k) =

i .
(4.96)
By Theorem 4.24, we immediately obtain σk+1 as the spectral norm of the
difference matrix. Let us have a closer look at (4.94). If we assume that
there is another matrix B with rk(B) ⩽k, such that
∥A −B∥2 <
A −bA(k)

2 ,
(4.97)
then there exists an at least (n −k)-dimensional null space Z ⊆Rn, such
that x ∈Z implies that Bx = 0. Then it follows that
∥Ax∥2 = ∥(A −B)x∥2 ,
(4.98)
and by using a version of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality (3.17) that en-
compasses norms of matrices, we obtain
∥Ax∥2 ⩽∥A −B∥2 ∥x∥2 < σk+1 ∥x∥2 .
(4.99)
However, there exists a (k + 1)-dimensional subspace where ∥Ax∥2 ⩾
σk+1 ∥x∥2, which is spanned by the right-singular vectors vj, j ⩽k + 1 of
A. Adding up dimensions of these two spaces yields a number greater than
n, as there must be a nonzero vector in both spaces. This is a contradiction
of the rank-nullity theorem (Theorem 2.24) in Section 2.7.3.
The Eckart-Young theorem implies that we can use SVD to reduce a
rank-r matrix A to a rank-k matrix bA in a principled, optimal (in the
spectral norm sense) manner. We can interpret the approximation of A by
a rank-k matrix as a form of lossy compression. Therefore, the low-rank
approximation of a matrix appears in many machine learning applications,
e.g., image processing, noise ﬁltering, and regularization of ill-posed prob-
lems. Furthermore, it plays a key role in dimensionality reduction and
principal component analysis, as we will see in Chapter 10.
Example 4.15 (Finding Structure in Movie Ratings and Consumers
(continued))
Coming back to our movie-rating example, we can now apply the con-
cept of low-rank approximations to approximate the original data matrix.
Recall that our ﬁrst singular value captures the notion of science ﬁction
theme in movies and science ﬁction lovers. Thus, by using only the ﬁrst
singular value term in a rank-1 decomposition of the movie-rating matrix,
we obtain the predicted ratings

This ﬁrst rank-1 approximation A1 is insightful: it tells us that Ali and
Beatrix like science ﬁction movies, such as Star Wars and Bladerunner
(entries have values > 0.4), but fails to capture the ratings of the other
movies by Chandra. This is not surprising, as Chandra’s type of movies is
not captured by the ﬁrst singular value. The second singular value gives
us a better rank-1 approximation for those movie-theme lovers:

4.7 Matrix Phylogeny
The word
“phylogenetic”
describes how we
capture the
relationships among
individuals or
groups and derived
from the Greek
words for “tribe”
and “source”.
In Chapters 2 and 3, we covered the basics of linear algebra and analytic
geometry. In this chapter, we looked at fundamental characteristics of ma-
trices and linear mappings. Figure 4.13 depicts the phylogenetic tree of
relationships between different types of matrices (black arrows indicating
“is a subset of”) and the covered operations we can perform on them (in
blue). We consider all real matrices A ∈Rn×m. For non-square matrices
(where n ̸= m), the SVD always exists, as we saw in this chapter. Focus-
ing on square matrices A ∈Rn×n, the determinant informs us whether a
square matrix possesses an inverse matrix, i.e., whether it belongs to the
class of regular, invertible matrices. If the square n × n matrix possesses n
linearly independent eigenvectors, then the matrix is non-defective and an
eigendecomposition exists (Theorem 4.12). We know that repeated eigen-
values may result in defective matrices, which cannot be diagonalized.
Non-singular and non-defective matrices are not the same. For exam-
ple, a rotation matrix will be invertible (determinant is nonzero) but not
diagonalizable in the real numbers (eigenvalues are not guaranteed to be
real numbers).

4.8 Further Reading
135
We dive further into the branch of non-defective square n × n matrices.
A is normal if the condition A⊤A = AA⊤holds. Moreover, if the more
restrictive condition holds that A⊤A = AA⊤= I, then A is called or-
thogonal (see Deﬁnition 3.8). The set of orthogonal matrices is a subset of
the regular (invertible) matrices and satisﬁes A⊤= A−1.
Normal matrices have a frequently encountered subset, the symmetric
matrices S ∈Rn×n, which satisfy S = S⊤. Symmetric matrices have only
real eigenvalues. A subset of the symmetric matrices consists of the pos-
itive deﬁnite matrices P that satisfy the condition of x⊤P x > 0 for all
x ∈Rn\{0}. In this case, a unique Cholesky decomposition exists (Theo-
rem 4.18). Positive deﬁnite matrices have only positive eigenvalues and
are always invertible (i.e., have a nonzero determinant).
Another subset of symmetric matrices consists of the diagonal matrices
D. Diagonal matrices are closed under multiplication and addition, but do
not necessarily form a group (this is only the case if all diagonal entries
are nonzero so that the matrix is invertible). A special diagonal matrix is
the identity matrix I.
4.8 Further Reading
Most of the content in this chapter establishes underlying mathematics
and connects them to methods for studying mappings, many of which are
at the heart of machine learning at the level of underpinning software so-
lutions and building blocks for almost all machine learning theory. Matrix
characterization using determinants, eigenspectra, and eigenspaces pro-
vides fundamental features and conditions for categorizing and analyzing
matrices. This extends to all forms of representations of data and map-
pings involving data, as well as judging the numerical stability of compu-
tational operations on such matrices (Press et al., 2007).
Determinants are fundamental tools in order to invert matrices and
compute eigenvalues “by hand”. However, for almost all but the smallest
instances, numerical computation by Gaussian elimination outperforms
determinants (Press et al., 2007). Determinants remain nevertheless a
powerful theoretical concept, e.g., to gain intuition about the orientation
of a basis based on the sign of the determinant. Eigenvectors can be used
to perform basis changes to transform data into the coordinates of mean-
ingful orthogonal, feature vectors. Similarly, matrix decomposition meth-
ods, such as the Cholesky decomposition, reappear often when we com-
pute or simulate random events (Rubinstein and Kroese, 2016). Therefore,
the Cholesky decomposition enables us to compute the reparametrization
trick where we want to perform continuous differentiation over random
variables, e.g., in variational autoencoders (Jimenez Rezende et al., 2014;
Kingma and Welling, 2014).
Eigendecomposition is fundamental in enabling us to extract mean-
ingful and interpretable information that characterizes linear mappings.

136
Matrix Decompositions
Therefore, the eigendecomposition underlies a general class of machine
learning algorithms called spectral methods that perform eigendecomposi-
tion of a positive-deﬁnite kernel. These spectral decomposition methods
encompass classical approaches to statistical data analysis, such as the
following:
principal component
analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA (Pearson, 1901), see also Chapter 10),
in which a low-dimensional subspace, which explains most of the vari-
ability in the data, is sought.
Fisher discriminant
analysis
Fisher discriminant analysis, which aims to determine a separating hy-
perplane for data classiﬁcation (Mika et al., 1999).
multidimensional
scaling
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) (Carroll and Chang, 1970).
The computational efﬁciency of these methods typically comes from ﬁnd-
ing the best rank-k approximation to a symmetric, positive semideﬁnite
matrix. More contemporary examples of spectral methods have different
origins, but each of them requires the computation of the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of a positive-deﬁnite kernel, such as Isomap (Tenenbaum
Isomap
et al., 2000), Laplacian eigenmaps (Belkin and Niyogi, 2003), Hessian
Laplacian
eigenmaps
Hessian eigenmaps
eigenmaps (Donoho and Grimes, 2003), and spectral clustering (Shi and
spectral clustering
Malik, 2000). The core computations of these are generally underpinned
by low-rank matrix approximation techniques (Belabbas and Wolfe, 2009)
as we encountered here via the SVD.
The SVD allows us to discover some of the same kind of information as
the eigendecomposition. However, the SVD is more generally applicable
to non-square matrices and data tables. These matrix factorization meth-
ods become relevant whenever we want to identify heterogeneity in data
when we want to perform data compression by approximation, e.g., in-
stead of storing n×m values just storing (n+m)k values, or when we want
to perform data pre-processing, e.g., to decorrelate predictor variables of
a design matrix (Ormoneit et al., 2001). The SVD operates on matrices,
which we can interpret as rectangular arrays with two indices (rows and
columns). The extension of matrix-like structure to higher-dimensional
arrays are called tensors. It turns out that the SVD is the special case of
a more general family of decompositions that operate on such tensors
(Kolda and Bader, 2009). SVD-like operations and low-rank approxima-
tions on tensors are, for example, the Tucker decomposition (Tucker, 1966)
Tucker
decomposition
or the CP decomposition (Carroll and Chang, 1970).
CP decomposition
The SVD low-rank approximation is frequently used in machine learn-
ing for computational efﬁciency reasons. This is because it reduces the
amount of memory and operations with nonzero multiplications we need
to perform on potentially very large matrices of data (Trefethen and Bau III,
1997). Moreover, low-rank approximations are used to operate on ma-
trices that may contain missing values as well as for purposes of lossy
compression and dimensionality reduction (Moonen and De Moor, 1995;
Markovsky, 2011).

Vector Calculus
Many algorithms in machine learning optimize an objective function with
respect to a set of desired model parameters that control how well a model
explains the data: Finding good parameters can be phrased as an opti-
mization problem (see Sections 8.2 and 8.3). Examples include: (i) lin-
ear regression (see Chapter 9), where we look at curve-ﬁtting problems
and optimize linear weight parameters to maximize the likelihood; (ii)
neural-network auto-encoders for dimensionality reduction and data com-
pression, where the parameters are the weights and biases of each layer,
and where we minimize a reconstruction error by repeated application of
the chain rule; and (iii) Gaussian mixture models (see Chapter 11) for
modeling data distributions, where we optimize the location and shape
parameters of each mixture component to maximize the likelihood of the
model. Figure 5.1 illustrates some of these problems, which we typically
solve by using optimization algorithms that exploit gradient information
(Section 7.1). Figure 5.2 gives an overview of how concepts in this chap-
ter are related and how they are connected to other chapters of the book.
Central to this chapter is the concept of a function. A function f is
a quantity that relates two quantities to each other. In this book, these
quantities are typically inputs x ∈RD and targets (function values) f(x),
which we assume are real-valued if not stated otherwise. Here RD is the
domain of f, and the function values f(x) are the image/codomain of f.

vector calculus is one of the fundamental mathematical tools we need in
machine learning. Throughout this book, we assume that functions are
differentiable. With some additional technical deﬁnitions, which we do
not cover here, many of the approaches presented can be extended to
sub-differentials (functions that are continuous but not differentiable at
certain points). We will look at an extension to the case of functions with
constraints in Chapter 7.
5.1 Differentiation of Univariate Functions
In the following, we brieﬂy revisit differentiation of a univariate function,
which may be familiar from high school mathematics. We start with the
difference quotient of a univariate function y = f(x), x, y ∈R, which we
will subsequently use to deﬁne derivatives.
Deﬁnition 5.1 (Difference Quotient). The difference quotient
difference quotient
δy
δx := f(x + δx) −f(x)
δx
(5.3)
computes the slope of the secant line through two points on the graph of
f. In Figure 5.3, these are the points with x-coordinates x0 and x0 + δx.
The difference quotient can also be considered the average slope of f
between x and x + δx if we assume f to be a linear function. In the limit
for δx →0, we obtain the tangent of f at x, if f is differentiable. The
tangent is then the derivative of f at x.
Deﬁnition 5.2 (Derivative). More formally, for h > 0 the derivative of f

at x is deﬁned as the limit

dx := lim
h→0

and the secant in Figure 5.3 becomes a tangent.
The derivative of f points in the direction of steepest ascent of f.

5.1.1 Taylor Series
The Taylor series is a representation of a function f as an inﬁnite sum of
terms. These terms are determined using derivatives of f evaluated at x0.

Remark. In general, a Taylor polynomial of degree n is an approximation
of a function, which does not need to be a polynomial. The Taylor poly-
nomial is similar to f in a neighborhood around x0. However, a Taylor
polynomial of degree n is an exact representation of a polynomial f of
degree k ⩽n since all derivatives f (i), i > k vanish.

Example 5.3 (Taylor Polynomial)
We consider the polynomial
f(x) = x4
(5.9)
and seek the Taylor polynomial T6, evaluated at x0 = 1. We start by com-
puting the coefﬁcients f (k)(1) for k = 0, . . . , 6:
f(1) = 1
(5.10)
f ′(1) = 4
(5.11)
f ′′(1) = 12
(5.12)
f (3)(1) = 24

f (4)(1) = 24
(5.14)
f (5)(1) = 0

Example 5.4 (Taylor Series)
Consider the function in Figure 5.4 given by
f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x) ∈C∞.
(5.19)
We seek a Taylor series expansion of f at x0 = 0, which is the Maclaurin
series expansion of f. We obtain the following derivatives:
f(0) = sin(0) + cos(0) = 1
(5.20)
f ′(0) = cos(0) −sin(0) = 1
(5.21)
f ′′(0) = −sin(0) −cos(0) = −1
(5.22)
f (3)(0) = −cos(0) + sin(0) = −1
(5.23)
f (4)(0) = sin(0) + cos(0) = f(0) = 1
(5.24)
...
We can see a pattern here: The coefﬁcients in our Taylor series are only
±1 (since sin(0) = 0), each of which occurs twice before switching to the
other one. Furthermore, f (k+4)(0) = f (k)(0).

5.1.2 Differentiation Rules
In the following, we brieﬂy state basic differentiation rules, where we
denote the derivative of f by f ′.
Product rule:
(f(x)g(x))′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x)
(5.29)
Quotient rule:
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
(g(x))2
(5.30)
Sum rule:
(f(x) + g(x))′ = f ′(x) + g′(x)
(5.31)
Chain rule:
 g(f(x))
′ = (g ◦f)′(x) = g′(f(x))f ′(x)
(5.32)
Here, g ◦f denotes function composition x 7→f(x) 7→g(f(x)).
Example 5.5 (Chain Rule)
Let us compute the derivative of the function h(x) = (2x + 1)4 using the
chain rule. With
h(x) = (2x + 1)4 = g(f(x)) ,
(5.33)
f(x) = 2x + 1 ,
(5.34)
g(f) = f 4 ,
(5.35)
we obtain the derivatives of f and g as
f ′(x) = 2 ,
(5.36)
g′(f) = 4f 3 ,

such that the derivative of h is given as

(5.34)

where we used the chain rule (5.32) and substituted the deﬁnition of f
in (5.34) in g′(f).
5.2 Partial Differentiation and Gradients
Differentiation as discussed in Section 5.1 applies to functions f of a
scalar variable x ∈R. In the following, we consider the general case
where the function f depends on one or more variables x ∈Rn, e.g.,
f(x) = f(x1, x2). The generalization of the derivative to functions of sev-
eral variables is the gradient.
We ﬁnd the gradient of the function f with respect to x by varying one
variable at a time and keeping the others constant. The gradient is then
the collection of these partial derivatives.
Deﬁnition 5.5 (Partial Derivative). For a function f : Rn →R, x 7→
f(x), x ∈Rn of n variables x1, . . . , xn we deﬁne the partial derivatives as

where n is the number of variables and 1 is the dimension of the image/
range/codomain of f. Here, we deﬁned the column vector x = [x1, . . . , xn]⊤
∈Rn. The row vector in (5.40) is called the gradient of f or the Jacobian

and is the generalization of the derivative from Section 5.1.
Remark. This deﬁnition of the Jacobian is a special case of the general
deﬁnition of the Jacobian for vector-valued functions as the collection of
partial derivatives. We will get back to this in Section 5.3.

= 2(x + 2y3) ∂

(5.42)
where we used the chain rule (5.32) to compute the partial derivatives.
Remark (Gradient as a Row Vector). It is not uncommon in the literature
to deﬁne the gradient vector as a column vector, following the conven-
tion that vectors are generally column vectors. The reason why we deﬁne
the gradient vector as a row vector is twofold: First, we can consistently
generalize the gradient to vector-valued functions f : Rn →Rm (then
the gradient becomes a matrix). Second, we can immediately apply the
multi-variate chain rule without paying attention to the dimension of the
gradient. We will discuss both points in Section 5.3.

5.2.1 Basic Rules of Partial Differentiation
Product rule:
(fg)′ = f′g + fg′,
Sum rule:
(f + g)′ = f′ + g′,
Chain rule:
(g(f))′ = g′(f)f′
In the multivariate case, where x ∈Rn, the basic differentiation rules that
we know from school (e.g., sum rule, product rule, chain rule; see also
Section 5.1.2) still apply. However, when we compute derivatives with re-
spect to vectors x ∈Rn we need to pay attention: Our gradients now
involve vectors and matrices, and matrix multiplication is not commuta-
tive (Section 2.2.1), i.e., the order matters.
Here are the general product rule, sum rule, and chain rule:

bles to some degree the rules for matrix multiplication where we said that
neighboring dimensions have to match for matrix multiplication to be de-
ﬁned; see Section 2.2.1. If we go from left to right, the chain rule exhibits
similar properties: ∂f shows up in the “denominator” of the ﬁrst factor
and in the “numerator” of the second factor. If we multiply the factors to-
gether, multiplication is deﬁned, i.e., the dimensions of ∂f match, and ∂f
“cancels”, such that ∂g/∂x remains.
5.2.2 Chain Rule
Consider a function f : R2 →R of two variables x1, x2. Furthermore,
x1(t) and x2(t) are themselves functions of t. To compute the gradient of
f with respect to t, we need to apply the chain rule (5.48) for multivariate
functions as

themselves functions of two variables s and t, the chain rule yields the

need to start transposing gradients for the matrix dimensions to match.
This may still be straightforward as long as the gradient is a vector or a
matrix; however, when the gradient becomes a tensor (we will discuss this
in the following), the transpose is no longer a triviality.
Remark (Verifying the Correctness of a Gradient Implementation). The
deﬁnition of the partial derivatives as the limit of the corresponding dif-
ference quotient (see (5.39)) can be exploited when numerically checking
the correctness of gradients in computer programs: When we compute

5.3 Gradients of Vector-Valued Functions
Thus far, we discussed partial derivatives and gradients of functions f :
Rn →R mapping to the real numbers. In the following, we will generalize
the concept of the gradient to vector-valued functions (vector ﬁelds) f :
Rn →Rm, where n ⩾1 and m > 1.
For a function f : Rn →Rm and a vector x = [x1, . . . , xn]⊤∈Rn, the
corresponding vector of function values is given as
f(x) =


f1(x)
...
fm(x)

∈Rm .
(5.54)
Writing the vector-valued function in this way allows us to view a vector-
valued function f : Rn →Rm as a vector of functions [f1, . . . , fm]⊤,
fi : Rn →R that map onto R. The differentiation rules for every fi are
exactly the ones we discussed in Section 5.2.

the row vector of the partial derivatives. In (5.55), every partial derivative

We will see how the Jacobian is used in the change-of-variable method
for probability distributions in Section 6.7. The amount of scaling due to
the transformation of a variable is provided by the determinant.
In Section 4.1, we saw that the determinant can be used to compute
the area of a parallelogram. If we are given two vectors b1 = [1, 0]⊤,
b2 = [0, 1]⊤as the sides of the unit square (blue; see Figure 5.5), the area
of this square is
det

If we take a parallelogram with the sides c1 = [−2, 1]⊤, c2 = [1, 1]⊤
(orange in Figure 5.5), its area is given as the absolute value of the deter-
minant (see Section 4.1)

i.e., the area of this is exactly three times the area of the unit square.
We can ﬁnd this scaling factor by ﬁnding a mapping that transforms the
unit square into the other square. In linear algebra terms, we effectively
perform a variable transformation from (b1, b2) to (c1, c2). In our case,
the mapping is linear and the absolute value of the determinant of this
mapping gives us exactly the scaling factor we are looking for.
We will describe two approaches to identify this mapping. First, we ex-
ploit that the mapping is linear so that we can use the tools from Chapter 2
to identify this mapping. Second, we will ﬁnd the mapping using partial
derivatives using the tools we have been discussing in this chapter.
Approach 1
To get started with the linear algebra approach, we
identify both {b1, b2} and {c1, c2} as bases of R2 (see Section 2.6.1 for a
recap). What we effectively perform is a change of basis from (b1, b2) to
(c1, c2), and we are looking for the transformation matrix that implements
the basis change. Using results from Section 2.7.2, we identify the desired
basis change matrix as

nant of J, which yields the scaling factor we are looking for, is given as
|det(J)| = 3, i.e., the area of the square spanned by (c1, c2) is three times
greater than the area spanned by (b1, b2).
Approach 2
The linear algebra approach works for linear trans-
formations; for nonlinear transformations (which become relevant in Sec-
tion 6.7), we follow a more general approach using partial derivatives.
For this approach, we consider a function f : R2 →R2 that performs a
variable transformation. In our example, f maps the coordinate represen-
tation of any vector x ∈R2 with respect to (b1, b2) onto the coordinate
representation y ∈R2 with respect to (c1, c2). We want to identify the
mapping so that we can compute how an area (or volume) changes when
it is being transformed by f. For this, we need to ﬁnd out how f(x)
changes if we modify x a bit. This question is exactly answered by the
Jacobian matrix df
dx ∈R2×2. Since we can write
y1 = −2x1 + x2
(5.63)
y2 = x1 + x2
(5.64)
we obtain the functional relationship between x and y, which allows us

and (5.66) recovers exactly the basis change matrix in (5.62). If the co-
ordinate transformation is nonlinear, the Jacobian approximates this non-
linear transformation locally with a linear one. The absolute value of the
Jacobian determinant |det(J)| is the factor by which areas or volumes are

would be (m×n)×(p×q), i.e., a four-dimensional tensor J, whose entries
are given as Jijkl = ∂Aij/∂Bkl.
Since matrices represent linear mappings, we can exploit the fact that
there is a vector-space isomorphism (linear, invertible mapping) between
the space Rm×n of m × n matrices and the space Rmn of mn vectors.
Therefore, we can re-shape our matrices into vectors of lengths mn and
pq, respectively. The gradient using these mn vectors results in a Jacobian
of size mn × pq. Figure 5.7 visualizes both approaches. In practical ap-

plications, it is often desirable to re-shape the matrix into a vector and
continue working with this Jacobian matrix: The chain rule (5.48) boils
down to simple matrix multiplication, whereas in the case of a Jacobian
tensor, we will need to pay more attention to what dimensions we need
to sum out.

Let us consider the following example, where
f = Ax ,
f ∈RM,
A ∈RM×N,

and where we seek the gradient df/dA. Let us start again by determining
the dimension of the gradient as

i = 1, . . . , M ,
(5.88)

in a machine learning context (Petersen and Pedersen, 2012). Here, we
use tr(·) as the trace (see Deﬁnition 4.4), det(·) as the determinant (see

Remark. In this book, we only cover traces and transposes of matrices.
However, we have seen that derivatives can be higher-dimensional ten-

cases, the trace of a D×D×E×F tensor would be an E×F-dimensional
matrix. This is a special case of a tensor contraction. Similarly, when we

ically, in (5.99) through (5.102), we require tensor-related computations
when we work with multivariate functions f(·) and compute derivatives
with respect to matrices (and choose not to vectorize them as discussed in

In many machine learning applications, we ﬁnd good model parameters
by performing gradient descent (Section 7.1), which relies on the fact
that we can compute the gradient of a learning objective with respect
to the parameters of the model. For a given objective function, we can
obtain the gradient with respect to the model parameters using calculus
and applying the chain rule; see Section 5.2.2. We already had a taste in
Section 5.3 when we looked at the gradient of a squared loss with respect
to the parameters of a linear regression model.

Writing out the gradient in this explicit way is often impractical since it
often results in a very lengthy expression for a derivative. In practice,
it means that, if we are not careful, the implementation of the gradient
could be signiﬁcantly more expensive than computing the function, which
imposes unnecessary overhead. For training deep neural network mod-
els, the backpropagation algorithm (Kelley, 1960; Bryson, 1961; Dreyfus,
backpropagation
1962; Rumelhart et al., 1986) is an efﬁcient way to compute the gradient
of an error function with respect to the parameters of the model.

5.6.2 Automatic Differentiation
It turns out that backpropagation is a special case of a general technique
in numerical analysis called automatic differentiation. We can think of au-

symbolically) evaluate the exact (up to machine precision) gradient of a

operations, e.g., addition and multiplication and elementary functions,
e.g., sin, cos, exp, log. By applying the chain rule to these operations, the
gradient of quite complicated functions can be computed automatically.
Automatic differentiation applies to general computer programs and has
forward and reverse modes. Baydin et al. (2018) give a great overview of
automatic differentiation in machine learning.
Figure 5.10 shows a simple graph representing the data ﬂow from in-
puts x to outputs y via some intermediate variables a, b. If we were to
compute the derivative dy/dx, we would apply the chain rule and obtain

In the following, we will focus on reverse mode automatic differentia-
tion, which is backpropagation. In the context of neural networks, where
the input dimensionality is often much higher than the dimensionality of
the labels, the reverse mode is computationally signiﬁcantly cheaper than
the forward mode. Let us start with an instructive example.

from (5.109). If we were to implement a function f on a computer, we
would be able to save some computation by using intermediate variables:

a = x2 ,

(5.124)
c = a + b ,

e = cos(c) ,
(5.127)
f = d + e .

This is the same kind of thinking process that occurs when applying
the chain rule. Note that the preceding set of equations requires fewer
operations than a direct implementation of the function f(x) as deﬁned
in (5.109). The corresponding computation graph in Figure 5.11 shows
the ﬂow of data and computations required to obtain the function value
f.
The set of equations that include intermediate variables can be thought
of as a computation graph, a representation that is widely used in imple-
mentations of neural network software libraries. We can directly compute
the derivatives of the intermediate variables with respect to their corre-
sponding inputs by recalling the deﬁnition of the derivative of elementary
functions. We obtain the following:

(5.142)
By thinking of each of the derivatives above as a variable, we observe
that the computation required for calculating the derivative is of similar
complexity as the computation of the function itself. This is quite counter-
intuitive since the mathematical expression for the derivative ∂f
∂x (5.110)
is signiﬁcantly more complicated than the mathematical expression of the
function f(x) in (5.109).
Automatic differentiation is a formalization of Example 5.14. Let x1, . . . , xd
be the input variables to the function, xd+1, . . . , xD−1 be the intermediate
variables, and xD the output variable. Then the computation graph can be
expressed as follows:

where the gi(·) are elementary functions and xPa(xi) are the parent nodes
of the variable xi in the graph. Given a function deﬁned in this way, we
can use the chain rule to compute the derivative of the function in a step-
by-step fashion. Recall that by deﬁnition f = xD and hence

is the backpropagation of the gradient through the computation graph.
For neural network training, we backpropagate the error of the prediction
with respect to the label.
The automatic differentiation approach above works whenever we have
a function that can be expressed as a computation graph, where the ele-
mentary functions are differentiable. In fact, the function may not even be
a mathematical function but a computer program. However, not all com-
puter programs can be automatically differentiated, e.g., if we cannot ﬁnd
differential elementary functions. Programming structures, such as for
loops and if statements, require more care as well.
5.7 Higher-Order Derivatives
So far, we have discussed gradients, i.e., ﬁrst-order derivatives. Some-
times, we are interested in derivatives of higher order, e.g., when we want
to use Newton’s Method for optimization, which requires second-order
derivatives (Nocedal and Wright, 2006). In Section 5.1.1, we discussed
the Taylor series to approximate functions using polynomials. In the mul-
tivariate case, we can do exactly the same. In the following, we will do
exactly this. But let us start with some notation.
Consider a function f : R2 →R of two variables x, y. We use the
following notation for higher-order partial derivatives (and for gradients):
∂2f
∂x2 is the second partial derivative of f with respect to x.
∂nf
∂xn is the nth partial derivative of f with respect to x.
∂2f
∂y∂x =
∂
∂y
  ∂f


is the partial derivative obtained by ﬁrst partial differ-
entiating with respect to x and then with respect to y.
∂2f
∂x∂y is the partial derivative obtained by ﬁrst partial differentiating by
y and then x.
The Hessian is the collection of all second-order partial derivatives.

5.8 Linearization and Multivariate Taylor Series
The gradient ∇f of a function f is often used for a locally linear approxi-
mation of f around x0:
f(x) ≈f(x0) + (∇xf)(x0)(x −x0) .
(5.148)
Here (∇xf)(x0) is the gradient of f with respect to x, evaluated at x0.
Figure 5.12 illustrates the linear approximation of a function f at an input
x0. The original function is approximated by a straight line. This approx-
imation is locally accurate, but the farther we move away from x0 the
worse the approximation gets. Equation (5.148) is a special case of a mul-
tivariate Taylor series expansion of f at x0, where we consider only the
ﬁrst two terms. We discuss the more general case in the following, which
will allow for better approximations.

a polynomial of degree 3. We are looking for a Taylor series expansion,
which itself is a linear combination of polynomials. Therefore, we do not

Probability and Distributions
Probability, loosely speaking, concerns the study of uncertainty. Probabil-
ity can be thought of as the fraction of times an event occurs, or as a degree
of belief about an event. We then would like to use this probability to mea-
sure the chance of something occurring in an experiment. As mentioned
in Chapter 1, we often quantify uncertainty in the data, uncertainty in the
machine learning model, and uncertainty in the predictions produced by
the model. Quantifying uncertainty requires the idea of a random variable,
random variable
which is a function that maps outcomes of random experiments to a set of
properties that we are interested in. Associated with the random variable
is a function that measures the probability that a particular outcome (or
set of outcomes) will occur; this is called the probability distribution.
probability
distribution
Probability distributions are used as a building block for other con-
cepts, such as probabilistic modeling (Section 8.4), graphical models (Sec-
tion 8.5), and model selection (Section 8.6). In the next section, we present
the three concepts that deﬁne a probability space (the sample space, the
events, and the probability of an event) and how they are related to a
fourth concept called the random variable. The presentation is deliber-
ately slightly hand wavy since a rigorous presentation may occlude the
intuition behind the concepts. An outline of the concepts presented in this
chapter are shown in Figure 6.1.
6.1 Construction of a Probability Space
The theory of probability aims at deﬁning a mathematical structure to
describe random outcomes of experiments. For example, when tossing a
single coin, we cannot determine the outcome, but by doing a large num-
ber of coin tosses, we can observe a regularity in the average outcome.
Using this mathematical structure of probability, the goal is to perform
automated reasoning, and in this sense, probability generalizes logical
reasoning (Jaynes, 2003).
6.1.1 Philosophical Issues
When constructing automated reasoning systems, classical Boolean logic
does not allow us to express certain forms of plausible reasoning. Consider

the following scenario: We observe that A is false. We ﬁnd B becomes
less plausible, although no conclusion can be drawn from classical logic.
We observe that B is true. It seems A becomes more plausible. We use
this form of reasoning daily. We are waiting for a friend, and consider
three possibilities: H1, she is on time; H2, she has been delayed by trafﬁc;
and H3, she has been abducted by aliens. When we observe our friend
is late, we must logically rule out H1. We also tend to consider H2 to be
more likely, though we are not logically required to do so. Finally, we may
consider H3 to be possible, but we continue to consider it quite unlikely.
How do we conclude H2 is the most plausible answer? Seen in this way,
“For plausible
reasoning it is
necessary to extend
the discrete true and
false values of truth
to continuous
plausibilities”
(Jaynes, 2003).
probability theory can be considered a generalization of Boolean logic. In
the context of machine learning, it is often applied in this way to formalize
the design of automated reasoning systems. Further arguments about how
probability theory is the foundation of reasoning systems can be found
in Pearl (1988).
The philosophical basis of probability and how it should be somehow
related to what we think should be true (in the logical sense) was studied
by Cox (Jaynes, 2003). Another way to think about it is that if we are
precise about our common sense we end up constructing probabilities.
E. T. Jaynes (1922–1998) identiﬁed three mathematical criteria, which
must apply to all plausibilities:
1. The degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.
2. These numbers must be based on the rules of common sense.

Probability and Distributions
3. The resulting reasoning must be consistent, with the three following
meanings of the word “consistent”:
(a) Consistency or non-contradiction: When the same result can be
reached through different means, the same plausibility value must
be found in all cases.
(b) Honesty: All available data must be taken into account.
(c) Reproducibility: If our state of knowledge about two problems are
the same, then we must assign the same degree of plausibility to
both of them.
The Cox–Jaynes theorem proves these plausibilities to be sufﬁcient to
deﬁne the universal mathematical rules that apply to plausibility p, up to
transformation by an arbitrary monotonic function. Crucially, these rules
are the rules of probability.
Remark. In machine learning and statistics, there are two major interpre-
tations of probability: the Bayesian and frequentist interpretations (Bishop,
2006; Efron and Hastie, 2016). The Bayesian interpretation uses probabil-
ity to specify the degree of uncertainty that the user has about an event. It
is sometimes referred to as “subjective probability” or “degree of belief”.
The frequentist interpretation considers the relative frequencies of events
of interest to the total number of events that occurred. The probability of
an event is deﬁned as the relative frequency of the event in the limit when
one has inﬁnite data.
♦
Some machine learning texts on probabilistic models use lazy notation
and jargon, which is confusing. This text is no exception. Multiple distinct
concepts are all referred to as “probability distribution”, and the reader
has to often disentangle the meaning from the context. One trick to help
make sense of probability distributions is to check whether we are trying
to model something categorical (a discrete random variable) or some-
thing continuous (a continuous random variable). The kinds of questions
we tackle in machine learning are closely related to whether we are con-
sidering categorical or continuous models.
6.1.2 Probability and Random Variables
There are three distinct ideas that are often confused when discussing
probabilities. First is the idea of a probability space, which allows us to
quantify the idea of a probability. However, we mostly do not work directly
with this basic probability space. Instead, we work with random variables
(the second idea), which transfers the probability to a more convenient
(often numerical) space. The third idea is the idea of a distribution or law
associated with a random variable. We will introduce the ﬁrst two ideas
in this section and expand on the third idea in Section 6.2.
Modern probability is based on a set of axioms proposed by Kolmogorov

(Grinstead and Snell, 1997; Jaynes, 2003) that introduce the three con-
cepts of sample space, event space, and probability measure. The prob-
ability space models a real-world process (referred to as an experiment)
with random outcomes.
The sample space Ω
The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment,
sample space
usually denoted by Ω. For example, two successive coin tosses have
a sample space of {hh, tt, ht, th}, where “h” denotes “heads” and “t”
denotes “tails”.
The event space A
The event space is the space of potential results of the experiment. A
event space
subset A of the sample space Ωis in the event space A if at the end
of the experiment we can observe whether a particular outcome ω ∈Ω
is in A. The event space A is obtained by considering the collection of
subsets of Ω, and for discrete probability distributions (Section 6.2.1)
A is often the power set of Ω.
The probability P
With each event A ∈A, we associate a number P(A) that measures the
probability or degree of belief that the event will occur. P(A) is called
the probability of A.
probability
The probability of a single event must lie in the interval [0, 1], and the
total probability over all outcomes in the sample space Ωmust be 1, i.e.,
P(Ω) = 1. Given a probability space (Ω, A, P), we want to use it to model
some real-world phenomenon. In machine learning, we often avoid explic-
itly referring to the probability space, but instead refer to probabilities on
quantities of interest, which we denote by T . In this book, we refer to T
as the target space and refer to elements of T as states. We introduce a
target space
function X : Ω→T that takes an element of Ω(an outcome) and returns
a particular quantity of interest x, a value in T . This association/mapping
from Ωto T is called a random variable. For example, in the case of tossing
random variable
two coins and counting the number of heads, a random variable X maps
to the three possible outcomes: X(hh) = 2, X(ht) = 1, X(th) = 1, and
X(tt) = 0. In this particular case, T = {0, 1, 2}, and it is the probabilities
on elements of T that we are interested in. For a ﬁnite sample space Ωand

random nor is it a

ﬁnite T , the function corresponding to a random variable is essentially a
lookup table. For any subset S ⊆T , we associate PX(S) ∈[0, 1] (the
probability) to a particular event occurring corresponding to the random
variable X. Example 6.1 provides a concrete illustration of the terminol-
ogy.
Remark. The aforementioned sample space Ωunfortunately is referred
to by different names in different books. Another common name for Ω
is “state space” (Jacod and Protter, 2004), but state space is sometimes
reserved for referring to states in a dynamical system (Hasselblatt and

ities of intersections and unions of sets of events. A gentler introduction
to probability with many examples can be found in chapter 2 of Walpole
et al. (2011).
Consider a statistical experiment where we model a funfair game con-
sisting of drawing two coins from a bag (with replacement). There are
coins from USA (denoted as $) and UK (denoted as £) in the bag, and
since we draw two coins from the bag, there are four outcomes in total.
The state space or sample space Ωof this experiment is then ($, $), ($,
£), (£, $), (£, £). Let us assume that the composition of the bag of coins is
such that a draw returns at random a $ with probability 0.3.
The event we are interested in is the total number of times the repeated
draw returns $. Let us deﬁne a random variable X that maps the sample
space Ωto T , which denotes the number of times we draw $ out of the
bag. We can see from the preceding sample space we can get zero $, one $,
or two $s, and therefore T = {0, 1, 2}. The random variable X (a function
or lookup table) can be represented as a table like the following:
X(($, $)) = 2
(6.1)
X(($, £)) = 1
(6.2)
X((£, $)) = 1
(6.3)
X((£, £)) = 0 .
(6.4)
Since we return the ﬁrst coin we draw before drawing the second, this
implies that the two draws are independent of each other, which we will
discuss in Section 6.4.5. Note that there are two experimental outcomes,
which map to the same event, where only one of the draws returns $.
Therefore, the probability mass function (Section 6.2.1) of X is given by
P(X = 2) = P(($, $))
= P($) · P($)
= 0.3 · 0.3 = 0.09
(6.5)
P(X = 1) = P(($, £) ∪(£, $))
= P(($, £)) + P((£, $))
= 0.3 · (1 −0.3) + (1 −0.3) · 0.3 = 0.42
(6.6)
P(X = 0) = P((£, £))
= P(£) · P(£)
= (1 −0.3) · (1 −0.3) = 0.49 .

6.1 Construction of a Probability Space
177
In the calculation, we equated two different concepts, the probability
of the output of X and the probability of the samples in Ω. For example,
in (6.7) we say P(X = 0) = P((£, £)). Consider the random variable
X : Ω→T and a subset S ⊆T (for example, a single element of T ,
such as the outcome that one head is obtained when tossing two coins).
Let X−1(S) be the pre-image of S by X, i.e., the set of elements of Ωthat
map to S under X; {ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ∈S}. One way to understand the
transformation of probability from events in Ωvia the random variable
X is to associate it with the probability of the pre-image of S (Jacod and
Protter, 2004). For S ⊆T , we have the notation
PX(S) = P(X ∈S) = P(X−1(S)) = P({ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ∈S}) .
(6.8)
The left-hand side of (6.8) is the probability of the set of possible outcomes
(e.g., number of $ = 1) that we are interested in. Via the random variable
X, which maps states to outcomes, we see in the right-hand side of (6.8)
that this is the probability of the set of states (in Ω) that have the property
(e.g., $£, £$). We say that a random variable X is distributed according
to a particular probability distribution PX, which deﬁnes the probability
mapping between the event and the probability of the outcome of the
random variable. In other words, the function PX or equivalently P ◦X−1
is the law or distribution of random variable X.
law
distribution
Remark. The target space, that is, the range T of the random variable X,
is used to indicate the kind of probability space, i.e., a T random variable.
When T is ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite, this is called a discrete random
variable (Section 6.2.1). For continuous random variables (Section 6.2.2),
we only consider T = R or T = RD.
♦
6.1.3 Statistics
Probability theory and statistics are often presented together, but they con-
cern different aspects of uncertainty. One way of contrasting them is by the
kinds of problems that are considered. Using probability, we can consider
a model of some process, where the underlying uncertainty is captured
by random variables, and we use the rules of probability to derive what
happens. In statistics, we observe that something has happened and try
to ﬁgure out the underlying process that explains the observations. In this
sense, machine learning is close to statistics in its goals to construct a
model that adequately represents the process that generated the data. We
can use the rules of probability to obtain a “best-ﬁtting” model for some
data.
Another aspect of machine learning systems is that we are interested
in generalization error (see Chapter 8). This means that we are actually
interested in the performance of our system on instances that we will
observe in future, which are not identical to the instances that we have

seen so far. This analysis of future performance relies on probability and
statistics, most of which is beyond what will be presented in this chapter.
The interested reader is encouraged to look at the books by Boucheron
et al. (2013) and Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David (2014). We will see more
about statistics in Chapter 8.
6.2 Discrete and Continuous Probabilities
Let us focus our attention on ways to describe the probability of an event
as introduced in Section 6.1. Depending on whether the target space is dis-
crete or continuous, the natural way to refer to distributions is different.
When the target space T is discrete, we can specify the probability that a
random variable X takes a particular value x ∈T , denoted as P(X = x).
The expression P(X = x) for a discrete random variable X is known as
the probability mass function. When the target space T is continuous, e.g.,
probability mass
function
the real line R, it is more natural to specify the probability that a random
variable X is in an interval, denoted by P(a ⩽X ⩽b) for a < b. By con-
vention, we specify the probability that a random variable X is less than
a particular value x, denoted by P(X ⩽x). The expression P(X ⩽x) for
a continuous random variable X is known as the cumulative distribution

Remark. We will use the phrase univariate distribution to refer to distribu-

multivariate distributions, and will usually consider a vector of random
multivariate

6.2.1 Discrete Probabilities
When the target space is discrete, we can imagine the probability distri-
bution of multiple random variables as ﬁlling out a (multidimensional)
array of numbers. Figure 6.2 shows an example. The target space of the
joint probability is the Cartesian product of the target spaces of each of
the random variables. We deﬁne the joint probability as the entry of both
joint probability
values jointly
P(X = xi, Y = yj) = nij
N ,
(6.9)
where nij is the number of events with state xi and yj and N the total
number of events. The joint probability is the probability of the intersec-
tion of both events, that is, P(X = xi, Y = yj) = P(X = xi ∩Y = yj).

that X = x and Y = y is (lazily) written as p(x, y) and is called the joint
probability. One can think of a probability as a function that takes state
x and y and returns a real number, which is the reason we write p(x, y).
The marginal probability that X takes the value x irrespective of the value

of random variable Y is (lazily) written as p(x). We write X ∼p(x) to
denote that the random variable X is distributed according to p(x). If we
consider only the instances where X = x, then the fraction of instances
(the conditional probability) for which Y = y is written (lazily) as p(y | x).

Example 6.2
Consider two random variables X and Y , where X has ﬁve possible states
and Y has three possible states, as shown in Figure 6.2. We denote by nij
the number of events with state X = xi and Y = yj, and denote by
N the total number of events. The value ci is the sum of the individual
frequencies for the ith column, that is, ci = P3
j=1 nij. Similarly, the value
rj is the row sum, that is, rj = P5
i=1 nij. Using these deﬁnitions, we can
compactly express the distribution of X and Y .
The probability distribution of each random variable, the marginal
probability, can be seen as the sum over a row or column

In machine learning, we use discrete probability distributions to model
categorical variables, i.e., variables that take a ﬁnite set of unordered val-
categorical variable
ues. They could be categorical features, such as the degree taken at uni-
versity when used for predicting the salary of a person, or categorical la-
bels, such as letters of the alphabet when doing handwriting recognition.
Discrete distributions are also often used to construct probabilistic models
that combine a ﬁnite number of continuous distributions (Chapter 11).
6.2.2 Continuous Probabilities
We consider real-valued random variables in this section, i.e., we consider
target spaces that are intervals of the real line R. In this book, we pretend
that we can perform operations on real random variables as if we have dis-
crete probability spaces with ﬁnite states. However, this simpliﬁcation is
not precise for two situations: when we repeat something inﬁnitely often,
and when we want to draw a point from an interval. The ﬁrst situation
arises when we discuss generalization errors in machine learning (Chap-
ter 8). The second situation arises when we want to discuss continuous
distributions, such as the Gaussian (Section 6.5). For our purposes, the
lack of precision allows for a briefer introduction to probability.
Remark. In continuous spaces, there are two additional technicalities,
which are counterintuitive. First, the set of all subsets (used to deﬁne
the event space A in Section 6.1) is not well behaved enough. A needs
to be restricted to behave well under set complements, set intersections,
and set unions. Second, the size of a set (which in discrete spaces can be
obtained by counting the elements) turns out to be tricky. The size of a
set is called its measure. For example, the cardinality of discrete sets, the
measure
length of an interval in R, and the volume of a region in Rd are all mea-
sures. Sets that behave well under set operations and additionally have
a topology are called a Borel σ-algebra. Betancourt details a careful con-
Borel σ-algebra
struction of probability spaces from set theory without being bogged down
in technicalities; see https://tinyurl.com/yb3t6mfd. For a more pre-
cise construction, we refer to Billingsley (1995) and Jacod and Protter
(2004).

RD to be a vector of real-valued random variables.

For probability mass functions (pmf) of discrete random variables, the
integral in (6.15) is replaced with a sum (6.12).
Observe that the probability density function is any function f that is
non-negative and integrates to one. We associate a random variable X
with this function f by
P(a ⩽X ⩽b) =
Z b
a
f(x)dx ,
(6.16)
where a, b ∈R and x ∈R are outcomes of the continuous random vari-
able X. States x ∈RD are deﬁned analogously by considering a vector
of x ∈R. This association (6.16) is called the law or distribution of the
law
random variable X.
P(X = x) is a set of
measure zero.
Remark. In contrast to discrete random variables, the probability of a con-
tinuous random variable X taking a particular value P(X = x) is zero.
This is like trying to specify an interval in (6.16) where a = b.

Deﬁnition 6.2 (Cumulative Distribution Function). A cumulative distribu-

tion function (cdf) of a multivariate real-valued random variable X with
states x ∈RD is given by
FX(x) = P(X1 ⩽x1, . . . , XD ⩽xD) ,

where X = [X1, . . . , XD]⊤, x = [x1, . . . , xD]⊤, and the right-hand side
represents the probability that random variable Xi takes the value smaller
than or equal to xi.
There are cdfs,
which do not have
corresponding pdfs.
The cdf can be expressed also as the integral of the probability density

Remark. We reiterate that there are in fact two distinct concepts when
talking about distributions. First is the idea of a pdf (denoted by f(x)),
which is a nonnegative function that sums to one. Second is the law of a
random variable X, that is, the association of a random variable X with
the pdf f(x).

6.2.3 Contrasting Discrete and Continuous Distributions
Recall from Section 6.1.2 that probabilities are positive and the total prob-
ability sums up to one. For discrete random variables (see (6.12)), this
implies that the probability of each state must lie in the interval [0, 1].
However, for continuous random variables the normalization (see (6.15))
does not imply that the value of the density is less than or equal to 1 for
all values. We illustrate this in Figure 6.3 using the uniform distribution
uniform distribution
for both discrete and continuous random variables.
Example 6.3
We consider two examples of the uniform distribution, where each state is
equally likely to occur. This example illustrates some differences between
discrete and continuous probability distributions.
Let Z be a discrete uniform random variable with three states {z =
−1.1, z = 0.3, z = 1.5}. The probability mass function can be represented

Alternatively, we can think of this as a graph (Figure 6.3(a)), where we
use the fact that the states can be located on the x-axis, and the y-axis
represents the probability of a particular state. The y-axis in Figure 6.3(a)
is deliberately extended so that is it the same as in Figure 6.3(b).

X ⩽1.6, as represented by Figure 6.3(b). Observe that the height of the

Remark. There is an additional subtlety with regards to discrete prob-
ability distributions. The states z1, . . . , zd do not in principle have any
structure, i.e., there is usually no way to compare them, for example
z1 = red, z2 = green, z3 = blue. However, in many machine learning
applications discrete states take numerical values, e.g., z1 = −1.1, z2 =
0.3, z3 = 1.5, where we could say z1 < z2 < z3. Discrete states that as-
sume numerical values are particularly useful because we often consider
expected values (Section 6.4.1) of random variables.
♦
Unfortunately, machine learning literature uses notation and nomen-
clature that hides the distinction between the sample space Ω, the target
space T , and the random variable X. For a value x of the set of possible
outcomes of the random variable X, i.e., x ∈T , p(x) denotes the prob-

ability that random variable X has the outcome x. For discrete random
variables, this is written as P(X = x), which is known as the probabil-
ity mass function. The pmf is often referred to as the “distribution”. For
continuous variables, p(x) is called the probability density function (often
referred to as a density). To muddy things even further, the cumulative
distribution function P(X ⩽x) is often also referred to as the “distribu-
tion”. In this chapter, we will use the notation X to refer to both univariate
and multivariate random variables, and denote the states by x and x re-
spectively. We summarize the nomenclature in Table 6.1.
Remark. We will be using the expression “probability distribution” not
only for discrete probability mass functions but also for continuous proba-
bility density functions, although this is technically incorrect. In line with
most machine learning literature, we also rely on context to distinguish
the different uses of the phrase probability distribution.

6.3 Sum Rule, Product Rule, and Bayes’ Theorem
We think of probability theory as an extension to logical reasoning. As we
discussed in Section 6.1.1, the rules of probability presented here follow

naturally from fulﬁlling the desiderata (Jaynes, 2003, chapter 2). Prob-
abilistic modeling (Section 8.4) provides a principled foundation for de-
signing machine learning methods. Once we have deﬁned probability dis-
tributions (Section 6.2) corresponding to the uncertainties of the data and
our problem, it turns out that there are only two fundamental rules, the
sum rule and the product rule.
Recall from (6.9) that p(x, y) is the joint distribution of the two ran-
dom variables x, y. The distributions p(x) and p(y) are the correspond-
ing marginal distributions, and p(y | x) is the conditional distribution of y
given x. Given the deﬁnitions of the marginal and conditional probability
for discrete and continuous random variables in Section 6.2, we can now
present the two fundamental rules in probability theory.
These two rules

2003) from the

where Y are the states of the target space of random variable Y . This
means that we sum out (or integrate out) the set of states y of the random
variable Y . The sum rule is also known as the marginalization property.
marginalization
property
The sum rule relates the joint distribution to a marginal distribution. In
general, when the joint distribution contains more than two random vari-
ables, the sum rule can be applied to any subset of the random variables,
resulting in a marginal distribution of potentially more than one random
variable. More concretely, if x = [x1, . . . , xD]⊤, we obtain the marginal

(6.21)
by repeated application of the sum rule where we integrate/sum out all
random variables except xi, which is indicated by \i, which reads “all
except i.”
Remark. Many of the computational challenges of probabilistic modeling
are due to the application of the sum rule. When there are many variables
or discrete variables with many states, the sum rule boils down to per-
forming a high-dimensional sum or integral. Performing high-dimensional
sums or integrals is generally computationally hard, in the sense that there
is no known polynomial-time algorithm to calculate them exactly.
♦
The second rule, known as the product rule, relates the joint distribution
product rule
to the conditional distribution via
p(x, y) = p(y | x)p(x) .
(6.22)
The product rule can be interpreted as the fact that every joint distribu-
tion of two random variables can be factorized (written as a product)

of two other distributions. The two factors are the marginal distribu-
tion of the ﬁrst random variable p(x), and the conditional distribution
of the second random variable given the ﬁrst p(y | x). Since the ordering
of random variables is arbitrary in p(x, y), the product rule also implies
p(x, y) = p(x | y)p(y). To be precise, (6.22) is expressed in terms of the
probability mass functions for discrete random variables. For continuous
random variables, the product rule is expressed in terms of the probability
density functions (Section 6.2.3).
In machine learning and Bayesian statistics, we are often interested in
making inferences of unobserved (latent) random variables given that we
have observed other random variables. Let us assume we have some prior
knowledge p(x) about an unobserved random variable x and some rela-
tionship p(y | x) between x and a second random variable y, which we
can observe. If we observe y, we can use Bayes’ theorem to draw some
conclusions about x given the observed values of y. Bayes’ theorem (also

is a direct consequence of the product rule in (6.22) since
p(x, y) = p(x | y)p(y)

and
p(x, y) = p(y | x)p(x)

In (6.23), p(x) is the prior, which encapsulates our subjective prior

knowledge of the unobserved (latent) variable x before observing any
data. We can choose any prior that makes sense to us, but it is critical to
ensure that the prior has a nonzero pdf (or pmf) on all plausible x, even
if they are very rare.

case of discrete probability distributions, it is the probability of the data y
if we were to know the latent variable x. Note that the likelihood is not a
distribution in x, but only in y. We call p(y | x) either the “likelihood of
x (given y)” or the “probability of y given x” but never the likelihood of
y (MacKay, 2003).
The posterior p(x | y) is the quantity of interest in Bayesian statistics

The quantity

is the marginal likelihood/evidence. The right-hand side of (6.27) uses the

expectation operator which we deﬁne in Section 6.4.1. By deﬁnition, the
marginal likelihood integrates the numerator of (6.23) with respect to the
latent variable x. Therefore, the marginal likelihood is independent of
x, and it ensures that the posterior p(x | y) is normalized. The marginal
likelihood can also be interpreted as the expected likelihood where we
take the expectation with respect to the prior p(x). Beyond normalization
of the posterior, the marginal likelihood also plays an important role in
Bayesian model selection, as we will discuss in Section 8.6. Due to the
integration in (8.44), the evidence is often hard to compute.
Bayes’ theorem is
also called the
“probabilistic
inverse.”
Bayes’ theorem (6.23) allows us to invert the relationship between x
and y given by the likelihood. Therefore, Bayes’ theorem is sometimes
called the probabilistic inverse. We will discuss Bayes’ theorem further in
probabilistic inverse
Section 8.4.
Remark. In Bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution is the quantity
of interest as it encapsulates all available information from the prior and
the data. Instead of carrying the posterior around, it is possible to focus
on some statistic of the posterior, such as the maximum of the posterior,
which we will discuss in Section 8.3. However, focusing on some statistic
of the posterior leads to loss of information. If we think in a bigger con-
text, then the posterior can be used within a decision-making system, and
having the full posterior can be extremely useful and lead to decisions that
are robust to disturbances. For example, in the context of model-based re-
inforcement learning, Deisenroth et al. (2015) show that using the full
posterior distribution of plausible transition functions leads to very fast
(data/sample efﬁcient) learning, whereas focusing on the maximum of
the posterior leads to consistent failures. Therefore, having the full pos-
terior can be very useful for a downstream task. In Chapter 9, we will
continue this discussion in the context of linear regression.

6.4 Summary Statistics and Independence
We are often interested in summarizing sets of random variables and com-
paring pairs of random variables. A statistic of a random variable is a de-
terministic function of that random variable. The summary statistics of a
distribution provide one useful view of how a random variable behaves,
and as the name suggests, provide numbers that summarize and charac-
terize the distribution. We describe the mean and the variance, two well-
known summary statistics. Then we discuss two ways to compare a pair
of random variables: ﬁrst, how to say that two random variables are inde-
pendent; and second, how to compute an inner product between them.

6.4.1 Means and Covariances
Mean and (co)variance are often useful to describe properties of probabil-
ity distributions (expected values and spread). We will see in Section 6.6
that there is a useful family of distributions (called the exponential fam-
ily), where the statistics of the random variable capture all possible infor-
mation.
The concept of the expected value is central to machine learning, and
the foundational concepts of probability itself can be derived from the
expected value (Whittle, 2000).
Deﬁnition 6.3 (Expected Value). The expected value of a function g : R →
expected value
R of a univariate continuous random variable X ∼p(x) is given by
EX[g(x)] =
Z
X
g(x)p(x)dx .
(6.28)
Correspondingly, the expected value of a function g of a discrete random
variable X ∼p(x) is given by
EX[g(x)] =
X
x∈X
g(x)p(x) ,
(6.29)
where X is the set of possible outcomes (the target space) of the random
variable X.
In this section, we consider discrete random variables to have numerical
outcomes. This can be seen by observing that the function g takes real
numbers as inputs.
The expected value
of a function of a
random variable is
sometimes referred
to as the law of the
unconscious
statistician (Casella
and Berger, 2002,
Section 2.2).
Remark. We consider multivariate random variables X as a ﬁnite vector
of univariate random variables [X1, . . . , XD]⊤. For multivariate random
variables, we deﬁne the expected value element wise
EX[g(x)] =



where the subscript EXd indicates that we are taking the expected value
with respect to the dth element of the vector x.
♦
Deﬁnition 6.3 deﬁnes the meaning of the notation EX as the operator
indicating that we should take the integral with respect to the probabil-
ity density (for continuous distributions) or the sum over all states (for
discrete distributions). The deﬁnition of the mean (Deﬁnition 6.4), is a
special case of the expected value, obtained by choosing g to be the iden-
tity function.

In one dimension, there are two other intuitive notions of “average”,
which are the median and the mode. The median is the “middle” value if
median
we sort the values, i.e., 50% of the values are greater than the median and
50% are smaller than the median. This idea can be generalized to contin-
uous values by considering the value where the cdf (Deﬁnition 6.2) is 0.5.
For distributions, which are asymmetric or have long tails, the median
provides an estimate of a typical value that is closer to human intuition
than the mean value. Furthermore, the median is more robust to outliers
than the mean. The generalization of the median to higher dimensions is
non-trivial as there is no obvious way to “sort” in more than one dimen-
sion (Hallin et al., 2010; Kong and Mizera, 2012). The mode is the most
mode
frequently occurring value. For a discrete random variable, the mode is
deﬁned as the value of x having the highest frequency of occurrence. For
a continuous random variable, the mode is deﬁned as a peak in the density
p(x). A particular density p(x) may have more than one mode, and fur-
thermore there may be a very large number of modes in high-dimensional
distributions. Therefore, ﬁnding all the modes of a distribution can be
computationally challenging.

marginal distributions is unimodal (has one mode). The horizontal bi-

points makes it difﬁcult. When we say “cannot deﬁne an ordering”, we

how dependent random variables are to one another.
Deﬁnition 6.5 (Covariance (Univariate)). The covariance between two
covariance
univariate random variables X, Y ∈R is given by the expected product
of their deviations from their respective means, i.e.,
CovX,Y [x, y] := EX,Y
(x −EX[x])(y −EY [y])

(6.35)
Terminology: The
covariance of
multivariate random
variables Cov[x, y]
is sometimes
referred to as
cross-covariance,
with covariance
referring to
Cov[x, x].
Remark. When the random variable associated with the expectation or
covariance is clear by its arguments, the subscript is often suppressed (for
example, EX[x] is often written as E[x]).
♦
By using the linearity of expectations, the expression in Deﬁnition 6.5
can be rewritten as the expected value of the product minus the product
of the expected values, i.e.,
Cov[x, y] = E[xy] −E[x]E[y] .
(6.36)
The covariance of a variable with itself Cov[x, x] is called the variance and
variance
is denoted by VX[x]. The square root of the variance is called the standard
standard deviation
deviation and is often denoted by σ(x). The notion of covariance can be
generalized to multivariate random variables.
Deﬁnition 6.6 (Covariance (Multivariate)). If we consider two multivari-
ate random variables X and Y with states x ∈RD and y ∈RE respec-
tively, the covariance between X and Y is deﬁned as
covariance
Cov[x, y] = E[xy⊤] −E[x]E[y]⊤= Cov[y, x]⊤∈RD×E .
(6.37)
Deﬁnition 6.6 can be applied with the same multivariate random vari-
able in both arguments, which results in a useful concept that intuitively
captures the “spread” of a random variable. For a multivariate random
variable, the variance describes the relation between individual dimen-
sions of the random variable.
Deﬁnition 6.7 (Variance). The variance of a random variable X with

Remark. In this book, we generally assume that covariance matrices are
positive deﬁnite to enable better intuition. We therefore do not discuss
corner cases that result in positive semideﬁnite (low-rank) covariance ma-
trices.
♦
When we want to compare the covariances between different pairs of
random variables, it turns out that the variance of each random variable
affects the value of the covariance. The normalized version of covariance
is called the correlation.
Deﬁnition 6.8 (Correlation). The correlation between two random vari-

ables X, Y is given by
corr[x, y] =
Cov[x, y]
p
V[x]V[y] ∈[−1, 1] .
(6.40)
The correlation matrix is the covariance matrix of standardized random
variables, x/σ(x). In other words, each random variable is divided by its
standard deviation (the square root of the variance) in the correlation
matrix.
The covariance (and correlation) indicate how two random variables
are related; see Figure 6.5. Positive correlation corr[x, y] means that when
x grows, then y is also expected to grow. Negative correlation means that
as x increases, then y decreases.
6.4.2 Empirical Means and Covariances
The deﬁnitions in Section 6.4.1 are often also called the population mean

and covariance

population statistics to the realization of empirical statistics. First, we use
the fact that we have a ﬁnite dataset (of size N) to construct an empirical
statistic that is a function of a ﬁnite number of identical random variables,
X1, . . . , XN. Second, we observe the data, that is, we look at the realiza-
tion x1, . . . , xN of each of the random variables and apply the empirical
statistic.
Speciﬁcally, for the mean (Deﬁnition 6.4), given a particular dataset we
can obtain an estimate of the mean, which is called the empirical mean or

sample mean. The same holds for the empirical covariance.

To compute the statistics for a particular dataset, we would use the
realizations (observations) x1, . . . , xN and use (6.41) and (6.42). Em-
pirical covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semideﬁnite (see Sec-
tion 3.2.3).
6.4.3 Three Expressions for the Variance
We now focus on a single random variable X and use the preceding em-
pirical formulas to derive three possible expressions for the variance. The

following derivation is the same for the population variance, except that
we need to take care of integrals. The standard deﬁnition of variance, cor-
responding to the deﬁnition of covariance (Deﬁnition 6.5), is the expec-
tation of the squared deviation of a random variable X from its expected
value µ, i.e.,
VX[x] := EX[(x −µ)2] .
(6.43)
The expectation in (6.43) and the mean µ = EX(x) are computed us-
ing (6.32), depending on whether X is a discrete or continuous random
variable. The variance as expressed in (6.43) is the mean of a new random
variable Z := (X −µ)2.
When estimating the variance in (6.43) empirically, we need to resort
to a two-pass algorithm: one pass through the data to calculate the mean
µ using (6.41), and then a second pass using this estimate ˆµ calculate the

variance. It turns out that we can avoid two passes by rearranging the
terms. The formula in (6.43) can be converted to the so-called raw-score

formula for variance:
VX[x] = EX[x2] −(EX[x])
2 .
(6.44)
The expression in (6.44) can be remembered as “the mean of the square
minus the square of the mean”. It can be calculated empirically in one pass
through data since we can accumulate xi (to calculate the mean) and x2
i
simultaneously, where xi is the ith observation. Unfortunately, if imple-

mented in this way, it can be numerically unstable. The raw-score version
of the variance can be useful in machine learning, e.g., when deriving the
bias–variance decomposition (Bishop, 2006).
A third way to understand the variance is that it is a sum of pairwise dif-
ferences between all pairs of observations. Consider a sample x1, . . . , xN
of realizations of random variable X, and we compute the squared differ-
ence between pairs of xi and xj. By expanding the square, we can show
that the sum of N 2 pairwise differences is the empirical variance of the
observations:

(6.45)
We see that (6.45) is twice the raw-score expression (6.44). This means
that we can express the sum of pairwise distances (of which there are N 2
of them) as a sum of deviations from the mean (of which there are N). Ge-
ometrically, this means that there is an equivalence between the pairwise
distances and the distances from the center of the set of points. From a
computational perspective, this means that by computing the mean (N
terms in the summation), and then computing the variance (again N
terms in the summation), we can obtain an expression (left-hand side
of (6.45)) that has N 2 terms.
6.4.4 Sums and Transformations of Random Variables
We may want to model a phenomenon that cannot be well explained by
textbook distributions (we introduce some in Sections 6.5 and 6.6), and
hence may perform simple manipulations of random variables (such as
adding two random variables).
Consider two random variables X, Y with states x, y ∈RD. Then:
E[x + y] = E[x] + E[y]
(6.46)
E[x −y] = E[x] −E[y]
(6.47)
V[x + y] = V[x] + V[y] + Cov[x, y] + Cov[y, x]
(6.48)
V[x −y] = V[x] + V[y] −Cov[x, y] −Cov[y, x] .

Mean and (co)variance exhibit some useful properties when it comes
to afﬁne transformation of random variables. Consider a random variable
X with mean µ and covariance matrix Σ and a (deterministic) afﬁne
transformation y = Ax + b of x. Then y is itself a random variable
whose mean vector and covariance matrix are given by
EY [y] = EX[Ax + b] = AEX[x] + b = Aµ + b ,
(6.50)
VY [y] = VX[Ax + b] = VX[Ax] = AVX[x]A⊤= AΣA⊤,

respectively. Furthermore,
This can be shown

6.4.5 Statistical Independence
Deﬁnition 6.10 (Independence). Two random variables X, Y are statis-

tically independent if and only if
p(x, y) = p(x)p(y) .
(6.53)
Intuitively, two random variables X and Y are independent if the value
of y (once known) does not add any additional information about x (and
vice versa). If X, Y are (statistically) independent, then
p(y | x) = p(y)
p(x | y) = p(x)
VX,Y [x + y] = VX[x] + VY [y]
CovX,Y [x, y] = 0
The last point may not hold in converse, i.e., two random variables can
have covariance zero but are not statistically independent. To understand
why, recall that covariance measures only linear dependence. Therefore,
random variables that are nonlinearly dependent could have covariance
zero.
Example 6.5
Consider a random variable X with zero mean (EX[x] = 0) and also
EX[x3] = 0. Let y = x2 (hence, Y is dependent on X) and consider the
covariance (6.36) between X and Y . But this gives
Cov[x, y] = E[xy] −E[x]E[y] = E[x3] = 0 .

6.4 Summary Statistics and Independence

In machine learning, we often consider problems that can be mod-
eled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables,
independent and
identically
distributed
i.i.d.
X1, . . . , XN. For more than two random variables, the word “indepen-
dent” (Deﬁnition 6.10) usually refers to mutually independent random
variables, where all subsets are independent (see Pollard (2002, chap-
ter 4) and Jacod and Protter (2004, chapter 3)). The phrase “identically
distributed” means that all the random variables are from the same distri-
bution.
Another concept that is important in machine learning is conditional
independence.
Deﬁnition 6.11 (Conditional Independence). Two random variables X
and Y are conditionally independent given Z if and only if
conditionally
independent
p(x, y | z) = p(x | z)p(y | z)
for all
z ∈Z ,
(6.55)
where Z is the set of states of random variable Z. We write X ⊥⊥Y | Z to
denote that X is conditionally independent of Y given Z.
Deﬁnition 6.11 requires that the relation in (6.55) must hold true for
every value of z. The interpretation of (6.55) can be understood as “given
knowledge about z, the distribution of x and y factorizes”. Independence
can be cast as a special case of conditional independence if we write X ⊥⊥
Y | ∅. By using the product rule of probability (6.22), we can expand the
left-hand side of (6.55) to obtain
p(x, y | z) = p(x | y, z)p(y | z) .
(6.56)
By comparing the right-hand side of (6.55) with (6.56), we see that p(y | z)
appears in both of them so that
p(x | y, z) = p(x | z) .
(6.57)
Equation (6.57) provides an alternative deﬁnition of conditional indepen-
dence, i.e., X ⊥⊥Y | Z. This alternative presentation provides the inter-
pretation “given that we know z, knowledge about y does not change our
knowledge of x”.
6.4.6 Inner Products of Random Variables
Recall the deﬁnition of inner products from Section 3.2. We can deﬁne an

inner product between random variables, which we brieﬂy describe in this
section. If we have two uncorrelated random variables X, Y , then
V[x + y] = V[x] + V[y] .
(6.58)
Since variances are measured in squared units, this looks very much like
the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles c2 = a2 + b2.
In the following, we see whether we can ﬁnd a geometric interpreta-
tion of the variance relation of uncorrelated random variables in (6.58).

Random variables can be considered vectors in a vector space, and we
can deﬁne inner products to obtain geometric properties of random vari-
ables (Eaton, 2007). If we deﬁne
⟨X, Y ⟩:= Cov[x, y]
(6.59)
for zero mean random variables X and Y , we obtain an inner product. We
see that the covariance is symmetric, positive deﬁnite, and linear in either

i.e., its standard deviation. The “longer” the random variable, the more
uncertain it is; and a random variable with length 0 is deterministic.

which is the correlation (Deﬁnition 6.8) between the two random vari-

angle between two random variables when we consider them geometri-
cally. We know from Deﬁnition 3.7 that X ⊥Y
⇐⇒⟨X, Y ⟩= 0. In our
case, this means that X and Y are orthogonal if and only if Cov[x, y] = 0,
i.e., they are uncorrelated. Figure 6.6 illustrates this relationship.

from the preceding deﬁnition of inner products) to compare probability
distributions, it is unfortunately not the best way to obtain distances be-
tween distributions. Recall that the probability mass (or density) is posi-
tive and needs to add up to 1. These constraints mean that distributions
live on something called a statistical manifold. The study of this space of
probability distributions is called information geometry. Computing dis-
tances between distributions are often done using Kullback-Leibler diver-
gence, which is a generalization of distances that account for properties of
the statistical manifold. Just like the Euclidean distance is a special case of
a metric (Section 3.3), the Kullback-Leibler divergence is a special case of
two more general classes of divergences called Bregman divergences and
f-divergences. The study of divergences is beyond the scope of this book,
and we refer for more details to the recent book by Amari (2016), one of
the founders of the ﬁeld of information geometry.

lowing. In particular, we will use it to deﬁne the likelihood and prior for
linear regression (Chapter 9), and consider a mixture of Gaussians for
density estimation (Chapter 11).
There are many other areas of machine learning that also beneﬁt from
using a Gaussian distribution, for example Gaussian processes, variational
inference, and reinforcement learning. It is also widely used in other ap-
plication areas such as signal processing (e.g., Kalman ﬁlter), control (e.g.,
linear quadratic regulator), and statistics (e.g., hypothesis testing).

distribution
Gaussians are widely used in statistical estimation and machine learn-
ing as they have closed-form expressions for marginal and conditional dis-
tributions. In Chapter 9, we use these closed-form expressions extensively
for linear regression. A major advantage of modeling with Gaussian ran-
dom variables is that variable transformations (Section 6.7) are often not
needed. Since the Gaussian distribution is fully speciﬁed by its mean and
covariance, we often can obtain the transformed distribution by applying
the transformation to the mean and covariance of the random variable.
6.5.1 Marginals and Conditionals of Gaussians are Gaussians
In the following, we present marginalization and conditioning in the gen-
eral case of multivariate random variables. If this is confusing at ﬁrst read-
ing, the reader is advised to consider two univariate random variables in-
stead. Let X and Y be two multivariate random variables, that may have

where Σxx = Cov[x, x] and Σyy = Cov[y, y] are the marginal covari-
ance matrices of x and y, respectively, and Σxy = Cov[x, y] is the cross-
covariance matrix between x and y.
The conditional distribution p(x | y) is also Gaussian (illustrated in Fig-
ure 6.9(c)) and given by (derived in Section 2.3 of Bishop, 2006)

Note that in the computation of the mean in (6.66), the y-value is an

Remark. The conditional Gaussian distribution shows up in many places,
where we are interested in posterior distributions:
The Kalman ﬁlter (Kalman, 1960), one of the most central algorithms
for state estimation in signal processing, does nothing but computing
Gaussian conditionals of joint distributions (Deisenroth and Ohlsson,
2011; S¨arkk¨a, 2013).
Gaussian processes (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006), which are a prac-
tical implementation of a distribution over functions. In a Gaussian pro-
cess, we make assumptions of joint Gaussianity of random variables. By
(Gaussian) conditioning on observed data, we can determine a poste-
rior distribution over functions.
Latent linear Gaussian models (Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999; Mur-
phy, 2012), which include probabilistic principal component analysis
(PPCA) (Tipping and Bishop, 1999). We will look at PPCA in more de-
tail in Section 10.7.

(see (6.64)) is itself Gaussian and computed by applying the sum rule
(6.20) and given by
p(x) =

p(x, y)dy = N

(6.68)
The corresponding result holds for p(y), which is obtained by marginaliz-
ing with respect to x. Intuitively, looking at the joint distribution in (6.64),
we ignore (i.e., integrate out) everything we are not interested in. This is
illustrated in Figure 6.9(b).

6.5.2 Product of Gaussian Densities
For linear regression (Chapter 9), we need to compute a Gaussian likeli-
hood. Furthermore, we may wish to assume a Gaussian prior (Section 9.3).
We apply Bayes’ Theorem to compute the posterior, which results in a mul-
tiplication of the likelihood and the prior, that is, the multiplication of two
Gaussian densities. The product of two Gaussians N

The scaling constant c itself can be written in the form of a Gaussian
density either in a or in b with an “inﬂated” covariance matrix A + B,
i.e., c = N

Remark. For notation convenience, we will sometimes use N

to describe the functional form of a Gaussian density even if x is not a
random variable. We have just done this in the preceding demonstration
when we wrote
c = N
 a | b, A + B
 = N

(6.77)
Here, neither a nor b are random variables. However, writing c in this way
is more compact than (6.76).

6.5.3 Sums and Linear Transformations
If X, Y are independent Gaussian random variables (i.e., the joint distri-
bution is given as p(x, y) = p(x)p(y)) with p(x) = N
 x | µx, Σx

and
p(y) = N
 y | µy, Σy

, then x + y is also Gaussian distributed and given
by
p(x + y) = N
 µx + µy, Σx + Σy
 .
(6.78)
Knowing that p(x + y) is Gaussian, the mean and covariance matrix can
be determined immediately using the results from (6.46) through (6.49).
This property will be important when we consider i.i.d. Gaussian noise
acting on random variables, as is the case for linear regression (Chap-
ter 9).
Example 6.7
Since expectations are linear operations, we can obtain the weighted sum
of independent Gaussian random variables

Probability and Distributions
Remark. A case that will be useful in Chapter 11 is the weighted sum of
Gaussian densities. This is different from the weighted sum of Gaussian
random variables.
♦
In Theorem 6.12, the random variable x is from a density that is a
mixture of two densities p1(x) and p2(x), weighted by α. The theorem can
be generalized to the multivariate random variable case, since linearity of
expectations holds also for multivariate random variables. However, the
idea of a squared random variable needs to be replaced by xx⊤.
Theorem 6.12. Consider a mixture of two univariate Gaussian densities
p(x) = αp1(x) + (1 −α)p2(x) ,
(6.80)
where the scalar 0 < α < 1 is the mixture weight, and p1(x) and p2(x) are
univariate Gaussian densities (Equation (6.62)) with different parameters,
i.e., (µ1, σ2
1) ̸= (µ2, σ2
2).
Then the mean of the mixture density p(x) is given by the weighted sum
of the means of each random variable:
E[x] = αµ1 + (1 −α)µ2 .
(6.81)
The variance of the mixture density p(x) is given by
V[x] =

(6.82)
Proof
The mean of the mixture density p(x) is given by the weighted
sum of the means of each random variable. We apply the deﬁnition of the
mean (Deﬁnition 6.4), and plug in our mixture (6.80), which yields
E[x] =

To compute the variance, we can use the raw-score version of the vari-
ance from (6.44), which requires an expression of the expectation of the
squared random variable. Here we use the deﬁnition of an expectation of
a function (the square) of a random variable (Deﬁnition 6.3),

variance (6.44) giving σ2 = E[x2] −µ2. This is rearranged such that the
expectation of a squared random variable is the sum of the squared mean
and the variance.
Therefore, the variance is given by subtracting (6.83d) from (6.84d),

Remark. The preceding derivation holds for any density, but since the
Gaussian is fully determined by the mean and variance, the mixture den-
sity can be determined in closed form.
♦
For a mixture density, the individual components can be considered
to be conditional distributions (conditioned on the component identity).
Equation (6.85c) is an example of the conditional variance formula, also
known as the law of total variance, which generally states that for two ran-
law of total variance
dom variables X and Y it holds that VX[x] = EY [VX[x|y]]+VY [EX[x|y]],
i.e., the (total) variance of X is the expected conditional variance plus the
variance of a conditional mean.
We consider in Example 6.17 a bivariate standard Gaussian random
variable X and performed a linear transformation Ax on it. The outcome
is a Gaussian random variable with mean zero and covariance AA⊤. Ob-
serve that adding a constant vector will change the mean of the distribu-
tion, without affecting its variance, that is, the random variable x + µ is
Gaussian with mean µ and identity covariance. Hence, any linear/afﬁne
transformation of a Gaussian random variable is Gaussian distributed.
Any linear/afﬁne
transformation of a

Consider a Gaussian distributed random variable X ∼N

a given matrix A of appropriate shape, let Y be a random variable such
that y = Ax is a transformed version of x. We can compute the mean of
y by exploiting that the expectation is a linear operator (6.50) as follows:
E[y] = E[Ax] = AE[x] = Aµ .
(6.86)
Similarly the variance of y can be found by using (6.51):
V[y] = V[Ax] = AV[x]A⊤= AΣA⊤.
(6.87)
This means that the random variable y is distributed according to

Let us now consider the reverse transformation: when we know that a
random variable has a mean that is a linear transformation of another
random variable. For a given full rank matrix A ∈RM×N, where M ⩾N,
let y ∈RM be a Gaussian random variable with mean Ax, i.e.,
p(y) = N

(6.89)
What is the corresponding probability distribution p(x)? If A is invert-
ible, then we can write x = A−1y and apply the transformation in the
previous paragraph. However, in general A is not invertible, and we use
an approach similar to that of the pseudo-inverse (3.57). That is, we pre-
multiply both sides with A⊤and then invert A⊤A, which is symmetric
and positive deﬁnite, giving us the relation
y = Ax ⇐⇒(A⊤A)−1A⊤y = x .
(6.90)
Hence, x is a linear transformation of y, and we obtain
p(x) = N

6.5.4 Sampling from Multivariate Gaussian Distributions
We will not explain the subtleties of random sampling on a computer, and
the interested reader is referred to Gentle (2004). In the case of a mul-
tivariate Gaussian, this process consists of three stages: ﬁrst, we need a
source of pseudo-random numbers that provide a uniform sample in the
interval [0,1]; second, we use a non-linear transformation such as the
Box-M¨uller transform (Devroye, 1986) to obtain a sample from a univari-
ate Gaussian; and third, we collate a vector of these samples to obtain a
sample from a multivariate standard normal N
 0, I

.
For a general multivariate Gaussian, that is, where the mean is non
zero and the covariance is not the identity matrix, we use the proper-
ties of linear transformations of a Gaussian random variable. Assume we
are interested in generating samples xi, i = 1, . . . , n, from a multivariate
Gaussian distribution with mean µ and covariance matrix Σ. We would

A is to use the Cholesky decomposition (Section 4.3) of the covariance
matrix Σ = AA⊤. The Cholesky decomposition has the beneﬁt that A is
triangular, leading to efﬁcient computation.

6.6 Conjugacy and the Exponential Family
Many of the probability distributions “with names” that we ﬁnd in statis-
tics textbooks were discovered to model particular types of phenomena.
For example, we have seen the Gaussian distribution in Section 6.5. The
distributions are also related to each other in complex ways (Leemis and
McQueston, 2008). For a beginner in the ﬁeld, it can be overwhelming to
ﬁgure out which distribution to use. In addition, many of these distribu-
tions were discovered at a time that statistics and computation were done

by pencil and paper. It is natural to ask what are meaningful concepts
in the computing age (Efron and Hastie, 2016). In the previous section,
we saw that many of the operations required for inference can be conve-
niently calculated when the distribution is Gaussian. It is worth recalling
at this point the desiderata for manipulating probability distributions in
the machine learning context:
1. There is some “closure property” when applying the rules of probability,
e.g., Bayes’ theorem. By closure, we mean that applying a particular
operation returns an object of the same type.
2. As we collect more data, we do not need more parameters to describe
the distribution.
3. Since we are interested in learning from data, we want parameter es-
timation to behave nicely.
It turns out that the class of distributions called the exponential family
exponential family
provides the right balance of generality while retaining favorable compu-
tation and inference properties. Before we introduce the exponential fam-
ily, let us see three more members of “named” probability distributions,
the Bernoulli (Example 6.8), Binomial (Example 6.9), and Beta (Exam-
ple 6.10) distributions.
Example 6.8
The

variable X with state x ∈{0, 1}. It is governed by a single continuous pa-
rameter µ ∈[0, 1] that represents the probability of X = 1. The Bernoulli
distribution Ber(µ) is deﬁned as
p(x | µ) = µx(1 −µ)1−x ,
x ∈{0, 1} ,
(6.92)
E[x] = µ ,
(6.93)
V[x] = µ(1 −µ) ,
(6.94)
where E[x] and V[x] are the mean and variance of the binary random
variable X.
An example where the Bernoulli distribution can be used is when we
are interested in modeling the probability of “heads” when ﬂipping a coin.

curence of this is when expressing the Multinomial distribution.
♦
Example 6.9 (Binomial Distribution)
The Binomial distribution is a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution
Binomial
distribution
to a distribution over integers (illustrated in Figure 6.10). In particular,
the Binomial can be used to describe the probability of observing m oc-
currences of X = 1 in a set of N samples from a Bernoulli distribution
where p(X = 1) = µ ∈[0, 1]. The Binomial distribution Bin(N, µ) is

E[m] = Nµ ,
(6.96)
V[m] = Nµ(1 −µ) ,
(6.97)
where E[m] and V[m] are the mean and variance of m, respectively.
An example where the Binomial could be used is if we want to describe
the probability of observing m “heads” in N coin-ﬂip experiments if the
probability for observing head in a single experiment is µ.

Intuitively, α moves probability mass toward 1, whereas β moves prob-
ability mass toward 0. There are some special cases (Murphy, 2012):
For α = 1 = β, we obtain the uniform distribution U[0, 1].
For α, β < 1, we get a bimodal distribution with spikes at 0 and 1.
For α, β > 1, the distribution is unimodal.
For α, β > 1 and α = β, the distribution is unimodal, symmetric, and
centered in the interval [0, 1], i.e., the mode/mean is at 1

Remark. There is a whole zoo of distributions with names, and they are
related in different ways to each other (Leemis and McQueston, 2008).

particular reason, but may have other applications. Knowing the reason
behind the creation of a particular distribution often allows insight into
how to best use it. We introduced preceding three distributions to be able

6.6.1 Conjugacy
According to Bayes’ theorem (6.23), the posterior is proportional to the
product of the prior and the likelihood. The speciﬁcation of the prior can
be tricky for two reasons: First, the prior should encapsulate our knowl-
edge about the problem before we see any data. This is often difﬁcult to
describe. Second, it is often not possible to compute the posterior distribu-
tion analytically. However, there are some priors that are computationally
convenient: conjugate priors.
conjugate prior
Deﬁnition 6.13 (Conjugate Prior). A prior is conjugate for the likelihood
conjugate
function if the posterior is of the same form/type as the prior.
Conjugacy is particularly convenient because we can algebraically cal-
culate our posterior distribution by updating the parameters of the prior
distribution.
Remark. When considering the geometry of probability distributions, con-
jugate priors retain the same distance structure as the likelihood (Agarwal
and Daum´e III, 2010).
♦
To introduce a concrete example of conjugate priors, we describe in Ex-
ample 6.11 the Binomial distribution (deﬁned on discrete random vari-
ables) and the Beta distribution (deﬁned on continuous random vari-
ables).
Example 6.11 (Beta-Binomial Conjugacy)
Consider a Binomial random variable x ∼Bin(N, µ) where
p(x | N, µ) =
 
N
x
!
µx(1 −µ)N−x ,
x = 0, 1, . . . , N ,

is the probability of ﬁnding x times the outcome “heads” in N coin ﬂips,
where µ is the probability of a “head”. We place a Beta prior on the pa-
rameter µ, that is, µ ∼Beta(α, β), where
p(µ | α, β) = Γ(α + β)
Γ(α)Γ(β)µα−1(1 −µ)β−1 .

If we now observe some outcome x = h, that is, we see h heads in N coin
ﬂips, we compute the posterior distribution on µ as

i.e., the posterior distribution is a Beta distribution as the prior, i.e., the
Beta prior is conjugate for the parameter µ in the Binomial likelihood
function.
In the following example, we will derive a result that is similar to the
Beta-Binomial conjugacy result. Here we will show that the Beta distribu-
tion is a conjugate prior for the Bernoulli distribution.
Example 6.12 (Beta-Bernoulli Conjugacy)
Let x ∈{0, 1} be distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with
parameter θ ∈[0, 1], that is, p(x = 1 | θ) = θ. This can also be expressed
as p(x | θ) = θx(1 −θ)1−x. Let θ be distributed according to a Beta distri-
bution with parameters α, β, that is, p(θ | α, β) ∝θα−1(1 −θ)β−1.
Multiplying the Beta and the Bernoulli distributions, we get
p(θ | x, α, β) = p(x | θ)p(θ | α, β)
(6.105a)
∝θx(1 −θ)1−xθα−1(1 −θ)β−1

The Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the parameter µ in both
the Binomial and the Bernoulli likelihood. For a Gaussian likelihood func-
tion, we can place a conjugate Gaussian prior on the mean. The reason
why the Gaussian likelihood appears twice in the table is that we need
to distinguish the univariate from the multivariate case. In the univariate
(scalar) case, the inverse Gamma is the conjugate prior for the variance.
In the multivariate case, we use a conjugate inverse Wishart distribution
as a prior on the covariance matrix. The Dirichlet distribution is the conju-

that random variable. For example, if x = [x1, . . . , xN]⊤is a vector of
univariate Gaussian random variables, that is, xn ∼N
 µ, σ2
, then the
sample mean ˆµ =
1
N (x1 + · · · + xN) is a statistic. Sir Ronald Fisher dis-
covered the notion of sufﬁcient statistics: the idea that there are statistics
sufﬁcient statistics
that will contain all available information that can be inferred from data
corresponding to the distribution under consideration. In other words, suf-
ﬁcient statistics carry all the information needed to make inference about
the population, that is, they are the statistics that are sufﬁcient to repre-
sent the distribution.
For a set of distributions parametrized by θ, let X be a random variable
with distribution p(x | θ0) given an unknown θ0. A vector φ(x) of statistics
is called sufﬁcient statistics for θ0 if they contain all possible informa-
tion about θ0. To be more formal about “contain all possible information”,
this means that the probability of x given θ can be factored into a part
that does not depend on θ, and a part that depends on θ only via φ(x).
The Fisher-Neyman factorization theorem formalizes this notion, which
we state in Theorem 6.14 without proof.
Theorem 6.14 (Fisher-Neyman). [Theorem 6.5 in Lehmann and Casella
(1998)] Let X have probability density function p(x | θ). Then the statistics
Fisher-Neyman
theorem
φ(x) are sufﬁcient for θ if and only if p(x | θ) can be written in the form
p(x | θ) = h(x)gθ(φ(x)) ,
(6.106)
where h(x) is a distribution independent of θ and gθ captures all the depen-
dence on θ via sufﬁcient statistics φ(x).
If p(x | θ) does not depend on θ, then φ(x) is trivially a sufﬁcient statistic
for any function φ. The more interesting case is that p(x | θ) is dependent
only on φ(x) and not x itself. In this case, φ(x) is a sufﬁcient statistic for
θ.
In machine learning, we consider a ﬁnite number of samples from a
distribution. One could imagine that for simple distributions (such as the
Bernoulli in Example 6.8) we only need a small number of samples to
estimate the parameters of the distributions. We could also consider the
opposite problem: If we have a set of data (a sample from an unknown
distribution), which distribution gives the best ﬁt? A natural question to
ask is, as we observe more data, do we need more parameters θ to de-
scribe the distribution? It turns out that the answer is yes in general, and
this is studied in non-parametric statistics (Wasserman, 2007). A converse
question is to consider which class of distributions have ﬁnite-dimensional

sufﬁcient statistics, that is the number of parameters needed to describe
them does not increase arbitrarily. The answer is exponential family dis-
tributions, described in the following section.
6.6.3 Exponential Family
There are three possible levels of abstraction we can have when con-
sidering distributions (of discrete or continuous random variables). At
level one (the most concrete end of the spectrum), we have a particu-
lar named distribution with ﬁxed parameters, for example a univariate
Gaussian N
 0, 1

with zero mean and unit variance. In machine learning,
we often use the second level of abstraction, that is, we ﬁx the paramet-
ric form (the univariate Gaussian) and infer the parameters from data. For
example, we assume a univariate Gaussian N
 µ, σ2
with unknown mean
µ and unknown variance σ2, and use a maximum likelihood ﬁt to deter-
mine the best parameters (µ, σ2). We will see an example of this when
considering linear regression in Chapter 9. A third level of abstraction is
to consider families of distributions, and in this book, we consider the ex-
ponential family. The univariate Gaussian is an example of a member of
the exponential family. Many of the widely used statistical models, includ-
ing all the “named” models in Table 6.2, are members of the exponential
family. They can all be uniﬁed into one concept (Brown, 1986).
Remark. A brief historical anecdote: Like many concepts in mathemat-
ics and science, exponential families were independently discovered at
the same time by different researchers. In the years 1935–1936, Edwin
Pitman in Tasmania, Georges Darmois in Paris, and Bernard Koopman in
New York independently showed that the exponential families are the only
families that enjoy ﬁnite-dimensional sufﬁcient statistics under repeated
independent sampling (Lehmann and Casella, 1998).
♦
An exponential family is a family of probability distributions, parame-
exponential family
terized by θ ∈RD, of the form
p(x | θ) = h(x) exp (⟨θ, φ(x)⟩−A(θ)) ,
(6.107)
where φ(x) is the vector of sufﬁcient statistics. In general, any inner prod-
uct (Section 3.2) can be used in (6.107), and for concreteness we will use
the standard dot product here (⟨θ, φ(x)⟩= θ⊤φ(x)). Note that the form
of the exponential family is essentially a particular expression of gθ(φ(x))
in the Fisher-Neyman theorem (Theorem 6.14).
The factor h(x) can be absorbed into the dot product term by adding
another entry (log h(x)) to the vector of sufﬁcient statistics φ(x), and
constraining the corresponding parameter θ0 = 1. The term A(θ) is the
normalization constant that ensures that the distribution sums up or inte-
grates to one and is called the log-partition function. A good intuitive no-
log-partition
function
tion of exponential families can be obtained by ignoring these two terms

p(x | θ) ∝exp

 .
(6.108)
For this form of parametrization, the parameters θ are called the natural
natural parameters
parameters. At ﬁrst glance, it seems that exponential families are a mun-
dane transformation by adding the exponential function to the result of a
dot product. However, there are many implications that allow for conve-
nient modeling and efﬁcient computation based on the fact that we can
capture information about data in φ(x).

Consider the univariate Gaussian distribution N

Then by using the deﬁnition of the exponential family,
p(x | θ) ∝exp(θ1x + θ2x2) .

ters given by θ in (6.110).

The relationship between θ and µ is invertible so that

(6.118)
The relation (6.118) is used to obtain the right equality of (6.117).
Remark. The relationship between the original Bernoulli parameter µ and
the natural parameter θ is known as the sigmoid or logistic function. Ob-
sigmoid
serve that µ ∈(0, 1) but θ ∈R, and therefore the sigmoid function
squeezes a real value into the range (0, 1). This property is useful in ma-
chine learning, for example it is used in logistic regression (Bishop, 2006,
section 4.3.2), as well as as a nonlinear activation functions in neural net-
works (Goodfellow et al., 2016, chapter 6).
♦
It is often not obvious how to ﬁnd the parametric form of the conjugate
distribution of a particular distribution (for example, those in Table 6.2).
Exponential families provide a convenient way to ﬁnd conjugate pairs of
distributions. Consider the random variable X is a member of the expo-
nential family (6.107):
p(x | θ) = h(x) exp (⟨θ, φ(x)⟩−A(θ)) .
(6.119)
Every member of the exponential family has a conjugate prior (Brown,
1986)

has dimension dim(θ) + 1. The sufﬁcient statistics of
the conjugate prior are

. By using the knowledge of the general
form of conjugate priors for exponential families, we can derive functional
forms of conjugate priors corresponding to particular distributions.

(6.122)
where we deﬁned γ := [α, β + α]⊤and hc(µ) := µ/(1 −µ). Equa-
tion (6.122) then simpliﬁes to
p(µ | α, β) = exp [(α −1) log µ + (β −1) log(1 −µ) −Ac(α, β)] .
(6.123)
Putting this in non-exponential family form yields
p(µ | α, β) ∝µα−1(1 −µ)β−1 ,
(6.124)
which we identify as the Beta distribution (6.98). In example 6.12, we
assumed that the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli
distribution and showed that it was indeed the conjugate prior. In this
example, we derived the form of the Beta distribution by looking at the
canonical conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution in exponential fam-
ily form.
As mentioned in the previous section, the main motivation for expo-
nential families is that they have ﬁnite-dimensional sufﬁcient statistics.
Additionally, conjugate distributions are easy to write down, and the con-
jugate distributions also come from an exponential family. From an infer-
ence perspective, maximum likelihood estimation behaves nicely because
empirical estimates of sufﬁcient statistics are optimal estimates of the pop-
ulation values of sufﬁcient statistics (recall the mean and covariance of a
Gaussian). From an optimization perspective, the log-likelihood function
is concave, allowing for efﬁcient optimization approaches to be applied
(Chapter 7).
6.7 Change of Variables/Inverse Transform
It may seem that there are very many known distributions, but in reality
the set of distributions for which we have names is quite limited. There-
fore, it is often useful to understand how transformed random variables
are distributed. For example, assuming that X is a random variable dis-
tributed according to the univariate normal distribution N
 0, 1

, what is
the distribution of X2? Another example, which is quite common in ma-
chine learning, is, given that X1 and X2 are univariate standard normal,
what is the distribution of 1
2(X1 + X2)?
One option to work out the distribution of 1
2(X1 + X2) is to calculate
the mean and variance of X1 and X2 and then combine them. As we saw
in Section 6.4.4, we can calculate the mean and variance of resulting ran-
dom variables when we consider afﬁne transformations of random vari-

ables. However, we may not be able to obtain the functional form of the
distribution under transformations. Furthermore, we may be interested
in nonlinear transformations of random variables for which closed-form
expressions are not readily available.
Remark (Notation). In this section, we will be explicit about random vari-
ables and the values they take. Hence, recall that we use capital letters
X, Y to denote random variables and small letters x, y to denote the val-
ues in the target space T that the random variables take. We will explicitly
write pmfs of discrete random variables X as P(X = x). For continuous
random variables X (Section 6.2.2), the pdf is written as f(x) and the cdf
is written as FX(x).
♦
We will look at two approaches for obtaining distributions of transfor-
mations of random variables: a direct approach using the deﬁnition of a
cumulative distribution function and a change-of-variable approach that
uses the chain rule of calculus (Section 5.2.2). The change-of-variable ap-
Moment generating
functions can also
be used to study
transformations of
random
variables (Casella
and Berger, 2002,
chapter 2).
proach is widely used because it provides a “recipe” for attempting to
compute the resulting distribution due to a transformation. We will ex-
plain the techniques for univariate random variables, and will only brieﬂy
provide the results for the general case of multivariate random variables.
Transformations of discrete random variables can be understood di-
rectly. Suppose that there is a discrete random variable X with pmf P(X =
x) (Section 6.2.1), and an invertible function U(x). Consider the trans-
formed random variable Y := U(X), with pmf P(Y = y). Then
P(Y = y) = P(U(X) = y)
transformation of interest
(6.125a)
= P(X = U −1(y))
inverse
(6.125b)
where we can observe that x = U −1(y). Therefore, for discrete random
variables, transformations directly change the individual events (with the
probabilities appropriately transformed).
6.7.1 Distribution Function Technique
The distribution function technique goes back to ﬁrst principles, and uses
the deﬁnition of a cdf FX(x) = P(X ⩽x) and the fact that its differential
is the pdf f(x) (Wasserman, 2004, chapter 2). For a random variable X
and a function U, we ﬁnd the pdf of the random variable Y := U(X) by
1. Finding the cdf:
FY (y) = P(Y ⩽y)
(6.126)
2. Differentiating the cdf FY (y) to get the pdf f(y).
f(y) = d

Probability and Distributions
We also need to keep in mind that the domain of the random variable may
have changed due to the transformation by U.
Example 6.16
Let X be a continuous random variable with probability density function
on 0 ⩽x ⩽1
f(x) = 3x2 .
(6.128)
We are interested in ﬁnding the pdf of Y = X2.
The function f is an increasing function of x, and therefore the resulting
value of y lies in the interval [0, 1]. We obtain

Therefore, the cdf of Y is

(6.131)
for 0 ⩽y ⩽1.
In Example 6.16, we considered a strictly monotonically increasing func-
tion f(x) = 3x2. This means that we could compute an inverse function.
Functions that have
inverses are called
bijective functions
(Section 2.7).
In general, we require that the function of interest y = U(x) has an in-
verse x = U −1(y). A useful result can be obtained by considering the cu-
mulative distribution function FX(x) of a random variable X, and using
it as the transformation U(x). This leads to the following theorem.
Theorem 6.15. [Theorem 2.1.10 in Casella and Berger (2002)] Let X be a
continuous random variable with a strictly monotonic cumulative distribu-
tion function FX(x). Then the random variable Y deﬁned as
Y := FX(X)
(6.132)
has a uniform distribution.

6.7 Change of Variables/Inverse Transform
217
Theorem 6.15 is known as the probability integral transform, and it is
probability integral
transform
used to derive algorithms for sampling from distributions by transforming
the result of sampling from a uniform random variable (Bishop, 2006).
The algorithm works by ﬁrst generating a sample from a uniform distribu-
tion, then transforming it by the inverse cdf (assuming this is available)
to obtain a sample from the desired distribution. The probability integral
transform is also used for hypothesis testing whether a sample comes from
a particular distribution (Lehmann and Romano, 2005). The idea that the
output of a cdf gives a uniform distribution also forms the basis of copu-
las (Nelsen, 2006).
6.7.2 Change of Variables
The distribution function technique in Section 6.7.1 is derived from ﬁrst
principles, based on the deﬁnitions of cdfs and using properties of in-
verses, differentiation, and integration. This argument from ﬁrst principles
relies on two facts:
1. We can transform the cdf of Y into an expression that is a cdf of X.
2. We can differentiate the cdf to obtain the pdf.
Let us break down the reasoning step by step, with the goal of understand-
ing the more general change-of-variables approach in Theorem 6.16.
Change of variables
in probability relies
on the
change-of-variables
method in
calculus (Tandra,
2014).
Remark. The name “change of variables” comes from the idea of chang-
ing the variable of integration when faced with a difﬁcult integral. For
univariate functions, we use the substitution rule of integration,
Z
f(g(x))g′(x)dx =
Z
f(u)du ,
where
u = g(x) .
(6.133)
The derivation of this rule is based on the chain rule of calculus (5.32) and
by applying twice the fundamental theorem of calculus. The fundamental
theorem of calculus formalizes the fact that integration and differentiation
are somehow “inverses” of each other. An intuitive understanding of the
rule can be obtained by thinking (loosely) about small changes (differen-
tials) to the equation u = g(x), that is by considering ∆u = g′(x)∆x as a
differential of u = g(x). By subsituting u = g(x), the argument inside the
integral on the right-hand side of (6.133) becomes f(g(x)). By pretending
that the term du can be approximated by du ≈∆u = g′(x)∆x, and that
dx ≈∆x, we obtain (6.133).
♦
Consider a univariate random variable X, and an invertible function
U, which gives us another random variable Y = U(X). We assume that
random variable X has states x ∈[a, b]. By the deﬁnition of the cdf, we
have

Probability and Distributions
We are interested in a function U of the random variable
P(Y ⩽y) = P(U(X) ⩽y) ,
(6.135)
where we assume that the function U is invertible. An invertible function
on an interval is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. In the case
that U is strictly increasing, then its inverse U −1 is also strictly increasing.
By applying the inverse U −1 to the arguments of P(U(X) ⩽y), we obtain
P(U(X) ⩽y) = P(U −1(U(X)) ⩽U −1(y)) = P(X ⩽U −1(y)) .
(6.136)
The right-most term in (6.136) is an expression of the cdf of X. Recall the
deﬁnition of the cdf in terms of the pdf
P(X ⩽U −1(y)) =
Z U −1(y)
a
f(x)dx .
(6.137)
Now we have an expression of the cdf of Y in terms of x:
FY (y) =
Z U −1(y)
a
f(x)dx .
(6.138)
To obtain the pdf, we differentiate (6.138) with respect to y:
f(y) = d
dyFy(y) = d
dy
Z U −1(y)
a
f(x)dx .
(6.139)
Note that the integral on the right-hand side is with respect to x, but we
need an integral with respect to y because we are differentiating with
respect to y. In particular, we use (6.133) to get the substitution
Z
f(U −1(y))U −1′(y)dy =
Z
f(x)dx
where
x = U −1(y) .
(6.140)
Using (6.140) on the right-hand side of (6.139) gives us
f(y) = d
dy
Z U −1(y)
a
fx(U −1(y))U −1′(y)dy .
(6.141)
We then recall that differentiation is a linear operator and we use the
subscript x to remind ourselves that fx(U −1(y)) is a function of x and not
y. Invoking the fundamental theorem of calculus again gives us
f(y) = fx(U −1(y)) ·
 d
dyU −1(y)

.
(6.142)
Recall that we assumed that U is a strictly increasing function. For decreas-
ing functions, it turns out that we have a negative sign when we follow
the same derivation. We introduce the absolute value of the differential to
have the same expression for both increasing and decreasing U:
f(y) = fx(U −1(y)) ·

This is called the change-of-variable technique. The term

(6.143) measures how much a unit volume changes when applying U

Remark. In comparison to the discrete case in (6.125b), we have an addi-
tional factor
 d

. The continuous case requires more care because
P(Y = y) = 0 for all y. The probability density function f(y) does not
have a description as a probability of an event involving y.
♦
So far in this section, we have been studying univariate change of vari-
ables. The case for multivariate random variables is analogous, but com-
plicated by fact that the absolute value cannot be used for multivariate
functions. Instead, we use the determinant of the Jacobian matrix. Recall
from (5.58) that the Jacobian is a matrix of partial derivatives, and that
the existence of a nonzero determinant shows that we can invert the Ja-
cobian. Recall the discussion in Section 4.1 that the determinant arises
because our differentials (cubes of volume) are transformed into paral-
lelepipeds by the Jacobian. Let us summarize preceding the discussion in
the following theorem, which gives us a recipe for multivariate change of
variables.
Theorem 6.16. [Theorem 17.2 in Billingsley (1995)] Let f(x) be the value
of the probability density of the multivariate continuous random variable X.
If the vector-valued function y = U(x) is differentiable and invertible for
all values within the domain of x, then for corresponding values of y, the
probability density of Y = U(X) is given by
f(y) = fx(U −1(y)) ·

(6.144)
The theorem looks intimidating at ﬁrst glance, but the key point is that
a change of variable of a multivariate random variable follows the pro-
cedure of the univariate change of variable. First we need to work out
the inverse transform, and substitute that into the density of x. Then we
calculate the determinant of the Jacobian and multiply the result. The
following example illustrates the case of a bivariate random variable.

will see direct machine learning applications of these ideas in Chapters 9
and 11.
6.8 Further Reading
This chapter is rather terse at times. Grinstead and Snell (1997) and
Walpole et al. (2011) provide more relaxed presentations that are suit-
able for self-study. Readers interested in more philosophical aspects of
probability should consider Hacking (2001), whereas an approach that
is more related to software engineering is presented by Downey (2014).
An overview of exponential families can be found in Barndorff-Nielsen
(2014). We will see more about how to use probability distributions to
model machine learning tasks in Chapter 8. Ironically, the recent surge
in interest in neural networks has resulted in a broader appreciation of
probabilistic models. For example, the idea of normalizing ﬂows (Jimenez
Rezende and Mohamed, 2015) relies on change of variables for transform-
ing random variables. An overview of methods for variational inference as
applied to neural networks is described in chapters 16 to 20 of the book
by Goodfellow et al. (2016).
We side stepped a large part of the difﬁculty in continuous random vari-
ables by avoiding measure theoretic questions (Billingsley, 1995; Pollard,
2002), and by assuming without construction that we have real numbers,
and ways of deﬁning sets on real numbers as well as their appropriate fre-
quency of occurrence. These details do matter, for example, in the speciﬁ-
cation of conditional probability p(y | x) for continuous random variables
x, y (Proschan and Presnell, 1998). The lazy notation hides the fact that
we want to specify that X = x (which is a set of measure zero). Fur-
thermore, we are interested in the probability density function of y. A
more precise notation would have to say Ey[f(y) | σ(x)], where we take
the expectation over y of a test function f conditioned on the σ-algebra of
x. A more technical audience interested in the details of probability the-
ory have many options (Jaynes, 2003; MacKay, 2003; Jacod and Protter,
2004; Grimmett and Welsh, 2014), including some very technical discus-
sions (Shiryayev, 1984; Lehmann and Casella, 1998; Dudley, 2002; Bickel
and Doksum, 2006; C¸inlar, 2011). An alternative way to approach proba-
bility is to start with the concept of expectation, and “work backward” to
derive the necessary properties of a probability space (Whittle, 2000). As
machine learning allows us to model more intricate distributions on ever
more complex types of data, a developer of probabilistic machine learn-
ing models would have to understand these more technical aspects. Ma-
chine learning texts with a probabilistic modeling focus include the books
by MacKay (2003); Bishop (2006); Rasmussen and Williams (2006); Bar-
ber (2012); Murphy (2012).

Continuous Optimization
Since machine learning algorithms are implemented on a computer, the
mathematical formulations are expressed as numerical optimization meth-
ods. This chapter describes the basic numerical methods for training ma-
chine learning models. Training a machine learning model often boils
down to ﬁnding a good set of parameters. The notion of “good” is de-
termined by the objective function or the probabilistic model, which we
will see examples of in the second part of this book. Given an objective
function, ﬁnding the best value is done using optimization algorithms.
Since we consider

This chapter covers two main branches of continuous optimization (Fig-
ure 7.1): unconstrained and constrained optimization. We will assume in
this chapter that our objective function is differentiable (see Chapter 5),
hence we have access to a gradient at each location in the space to help us
ﬁnd the optimum value. By convention, most objective functions in ma-
chine learning are intended to be minimized, that is, the best value is the
minimum value. Intuitively ﬁnding the best value is like ﬁnding the val-
leys of the objective function, and the gradients point us uphill. The idea is
to move downhill (opposite to the gradient) and hope to ﬁnd the deepest
point. For unconstrained optimization, this is the only concept we need,
but there are several design choices, which we discuss in Section 7.1. For
constrained optimization, we need to introduce other concepts to man-
age the constraints (Section 7.2). We will also introduce a special class
of problems (convex optimization problems in Section 7.3) where we can
make statements about reaching the global optimum.
Consider the function in Figure 7.2. The function has a global minimum

around x = −4.5, with a function value of approximately −47. Since
the function is “smooth,” the gradients can be used to help ﬁnd the min-

Since this is a cubic equation, it has in general three solutions when set to
zero. In the example, two of them are minimums and one is a maximum
(around x = −1.4). To check whether a stationary point is a minimum
or maximum, we need to take the derivative a second time and check
whether the second derivative is positive or negative at the stationary
point. In our case, the second derivative is

and the other two stationary points are minimums.
Note that we have avoided analytically solving for values of x in the
previous discussion, although for low-order polynomials such as the pre-
ceding we could do so. In general, we are unable to ﬁnd analytic solu-
tions, and hence we need to start at some value, say x0 = −6, and follow
the negative gradient. The negative gradient indicates that we should go

The discussion in this chapter so far was about a one-dimensional func-
tion, where we are able to visualize the ideas of gradients, descent direc-
tions, and optimal values. In the rest of this chapter we develop the same
ideas in high dimensions. Unfortunately, we can only visualize the con-
cepts in one dimension, but some concepts do not generalize directly to
higher dimensions, therefore some care needs to be taken when reading.

where f : Rd →R is an objective function that captures the machine
learning problem at hand. We assume that our function f is differentiable,
and we are unable to analytically ﬁnd a solution in closed form.
Gradient descent is a ﬁrst-order optimization algorithm. To ﬁnd a local
minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps propor-
tional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point.
Recall from Section 5.1 that the gradient points in the direction of the

steepest ascent. Another useful intuition is to consider the set of lines
where the function is at a certain value (f(x) = c for some value c ∈R),
which are known as the contour lines. The gradient points in a direction
that is orthogonal to the contour lines of the function we wish to optimize.
Let us consider multivariate functions. Imagine a surface (described by
the function f(x)) with a ball starting at a particular location x0. When
the ball is released, it will move downhill in the direction of steepest de-
scent. Gradient descent exploits the fact that f(x0) decreases fastest if one
moves from x0 in the direction of the negative gradient −((∇f)(x0))⊤of
f at x0. We assume in this book that the functions are differentiable, and
refer the reader to more general settings in Section 7.4. Then, if
x1 = x0 −γ((∇f)(x0))⊤
(7.5)
for a small step-size γ ⩾0, then f(x1) ⩽f(x0). Note that we use the
transpose for the gradient since otherwise the dimensions will not work
out.
This observation allows us to deﬁne a simple gradient descent algo-
rithm: If we want to ﬁnd a local optimum f(x∗) of a function f : Rn →
R, x 7→f(x), we start with an initial guess x0 of the parameters we wish
to optimize and then iterate according to

Remark. Gradient descent can be relatively slow close to the minimum:
Its asymptotic rate of convergence is inferior to many other methods. Us-
ing the ball rolling down the hill analogy, when the surface is a long, thin
valley, the problem is poorly conditioned (Trefethen and Bau III, 1997).
For poorly conditioned convex problems, gradient descent increasingly
“zigzags” as the gradients point nearly orthogonally to the shortest di-
rection to a minimum point; see Figure 7.3.

As mentioned earlier, choosing a good step-size is important in gradient
descent. If the step-size is too small, gradient descent can be slow. If the

step-size is chosen too large, gradient descent can overshoot, fail to con-
verge, or even diverge. We will discuss the use of momentum in the next
section. It is a method that smoothes out erratic behavior of gradient up-
dates and dampens oscillations.
Adaptive gradient methods rescale the step-size at each iteration, de-
pending on local properties of the function. There are two simple heuris-
tics (Toussaint, 2012):
When the function value increases after a gradient step, the step-size
was too large. Undo the step and decrease the step-size.
When the function value decreases the step could have been larger. Try
to increase the step-size.

Continuous Optimization
Although the “undo” step seems to be a waste of resources, using this
heuristic guarantees monotonic convergence.
Example 7.2 (Solving a Linear Equation System)
When we solve linear equations of the form Ax = b, in practice we solve
Ax−b = 0 approximately by ﬁnding x∗that minimizes the squared error
∥Ax −b∥2 = (Ax −b)⊤(Ax −b)
(7.9)
if we use the Euclidean norm. The gradient of (7.9) with respect to x is
∇x = 2(Ax −b)⊤A .
(7.10)
We can use this gradient directly in a gradient descent algorithm. How-
ever, for this particular special case, it turns out that there is an analytic
solution, which can be found by setting the gradient to zero. We will see
more on solving squared error problems in Chapter 9.
Remark. When applied to the solution of linear systems of equations Ax =
b, gradient descent may converge slowly. The speed of convergence of gra-
dient descent is dependent on the condition number κ = σ(A)max
σ(A)min , which
condition number
is the ratio of the maximum to the minimum singular value (Section 4.5)
of A. The condition number essentially measures the ratio of the most
curved direction versus the least curved direction, which corresponds to
our imagery that poorly conditioned problems are long, thin valleys: They
are very curved in one direction, but very ﬂat in the other. Instead of di-
rectly solving Ax = b, one could instead solve P −1(Ax −b) = 0, where
P is called the preconditioner. The goal is to design P −1 such that P −1A
preconditioner
has a better condition number, but at the same time P −1 is easy to com-
pute. For further information on gradient descent, preconditioning, and
convergence we refer to Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004, chapter 9).
♦
7.1.2 Gradient Descent With Momentum
As illustrated in Figure 7.3, the convergence of gradient descent may be
very slow if the curvature of the optimization surface is such that there
are regions that are poorly scaled. The curvature is such that the gradient
descent steps hops between the walls of the valley and approaches the
optimum in small steps. The proposed tweak to improve convergence is
to give gradient descent some memory.
Goh (2017) wrote
an intuitive blog
post on gradient
descent with
momentum.
Gradient descent with momentum (Rumelhart et al., 1986) is a method
that introduces an additional term to remember what happened in the
previous iteration. This memory dampens oscillations and smoothes out
the gradient updates. Continuing the ball analogy, the momentum term
emulates the phenomenon of a heavy ball that is reluctant to change di-
rections. The idea is to have a gradient update with memory to implement

a moving average. The momentum-based method remembers the update
∆xi at each iteration i and determines the next update as a linear combi-
nation of the current and previous gradients
xi+1 = xi −γi((∇f)(xi))⊤+ α∆xi
(7.11)
∆xi = xi −xi−1 = α∆xi−1 −γi−1((∇f)(xi−1))⊤,
(7.12)
where α ∈[0, 1]. Sometimes we will only know the gradient approxi-
mately. In such cases, the momentum term is useful since it averages out
different noisy estimates of the gradient. One particularly useful way to
obtain an approximate gradient is by using a stochastic approximation,
which we discuss next.
7.1.3 Stochastic Gradient Descent
Computing the gradient can be very time consuming. However, often it is
possible to ﬁnd a “cheap” approximation of the gradient. Approximating
the gradient is still useful as long as it points in roughly the same direction
as the true gradient.
stochastic gradient
descent
Stochastic gradient descent (often shortened as SGD) is a stochastic ap-
proximation of the gradient descent method for minimizing an objective
function that is written as a sum of differentiable functions. The word
stochastic here refers to the fact that we acknowledge that we do not
know the gradient precisely, but instead only know a noisy approxima-
tion to it. By constraining the probability distribution of the approximate
gradients, we can still theoretically guarantee that SGD will converge.
In machine learning, given n = 1, . . . , N data points, we often consider
objective functions that are the sum of the losses Ln incurred by each
example n. In mathematical notation, we have the form
L(θ) =
N
X
n=1
Ln(θ) ,
(7.13)
where θ is the vector of parameters of interest, i.e., we want to ﬁnd θ that
minimizes L. An example from regression (Chapter 9) is the negative log-
likelihood, which is expressed as a sum over log-likelihoods of individual
examples so that

(7.15)
for a suitable step-size parameter γi. Evaluating the sum gradient may re-
quire expensive evaluations of the gradients from all individual functions
Ln. When the training set is enormous and/or no simple formulas exist,
evaluating the sums of gradients becomes very expensive.
Consider the term PN
n=1(∇Ln(θi)) in (7.15), we can reduce the amount
of computation by taking a sum over a smaller set of Ln. In contrast to
batch gradient descent, which uses all Ln for n = 1, . . . , N, we randomly
choose a subset of Ln for mini-batch gradient descent. In the extreme
case, we randomly select only a single Ln to estimate the gradient. The
key insight about why taking a subset of data is sensible is to realize that
for gradient descent to converge, we only require that the gradient is an
unbiased estimate of the true gradient. In fact the term PN
n=1(∇Ln(θi))
in (7.15) is an empirical estimate of the expected value (Section 6.4.1) of
the gradient. Therefore, any other unbiased empirical estimate of the ex-
pected value, for example using any subsample of the data, would sufﬁce
for convergence of gradient descent.
Remark. When the learning rate decreases at an appropriate rate, and sub-
ject to relatively mild assumptions, stochastic gradient descent converges
almost surely to local minimum (Bottou, 1998).
♦
Why should one consider using an approximate gradient? A major rea-
son is practical implementation constraints, such as the size of central
processing unit (CPU)/graphics processing unit (GPU) memory or limits
on computational time. We can think of the size of the subset used to esti-
mate the gradient in the same way that we thought of the size of a sample
when estimating empirical means (Section 6.4.1). Large mini-batch sizes
will provide accurate estimates of the gradient, reducing the variance in
the parameter update. Furthermore, large mini-batches take advantage of
highly optimized matrix operations in vectorized implementations of the
cost and gradient. The reduction in variance leads to more stable conver-
gence, but each gradient calculation will be more expensive.
In contrast, small mini-batches are quick to estimate. If we keep the
mini-batch size small, the noise in our gradient estimate will allow us to
get out of some bad local optima, which we may otherwise get stuck in.
In machine learning, optimization methods are used for training by min-
imizing an objective function on the training data, but the overall goal
is to improve generalization performance (Chapter 8). Since the goal in
machine learning does not necessarily need a precise estimate of the min-
imum of the objective function, approximate gradients using mini-batch
approaches have been widely used. Stochastic gradient descent is very
effective in large-scale machine learning problems (Bottou et al., 2018),

7.2 Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multipliers
In the previous section, we considered the problem of solving for the min-
imum of a function
min
x f(x) ,
(7.16)
where f : RD →R.
In this section, we have additional constraints. That is, for real-valued
functions gi : RD →R for i = 1, . . . , m, we consider the constrained
optimization problem (see Figure 7.4 for an illustration)
min

(7.17)
subject to
gi(x) ⩽0
for all
i = 1, . . . , m .
It is worth pointing out that the functions f and gi could be non-convex
in general, and we will consider the convex case in the next section.
One obvious, but not very practical, way of converting the constrained
problem (7.17) into an unconstrained one is to use an indicator function

(7.19)
This gives inﬁnite penalty if the constraint is not satisﬁed, and hence
would provide the same solution. However, this inﬁnite step function is
equally difﬁcult to optimize. We can overcome this difﬁculty by introduc-
ing Lagrange multipliers. The idea of Lagrange multipliers is to replace the
Lagrange multiplier
step function with a linear function.
We associate to problem (7.17) the Lagrangian by introducing the La-
Lagrangian
grange multipliers λi ⩾0 corresponding to each inequality constraint re-
spectively (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004, chapter 4) so that

where in the last line we have concatenated all constraints gi(x) into a
vector g(x), and all the Lagrange multipliers into a vector λ ∈Rm.
We now introduce the idea of Lagrangian duality. In general, duality
in optimization is the idea of converting an optimization problem in one
set of variables x (called the primal variables), into another optimization
problem in a different set of variables λ (called the dual variables). We
introduce two different approaches to duality: In this section, we discuss
Lagrangian duality; in Section 7.3.3, we discuss Legendre-Fenchel duality.
Deﬁnition 7.1. The problem in (7.17)

The associated Lagrangian dual problem is given by

(7.22)
where λ are the dual variables and D(λ) = minx∈Rd L(x, λ).
Remark. In the discussion of Deﬁnition 7.1, we use two concepts that are
also of independent interest (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004).
First is the minimax inequality, which says that for any function with

7.2 Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multipliers
235
This inequality can be proved by considering the inequality
For all x, y
min
x ϕ(x, y) ⩽max
y
ϕ(x, y) .
(7.24)
Note that taking the maximum over y of the left-hand side of (7.24) main-
tains the inequality since the inequality is true for all y. Similarly, we can
take the minimum over x of the right-hand side of (7.24) to obtain (7.23).
The second concept is weak duality, which uses (7.23) to show that
weak duality
primal values are always greater than or equal to dual values. This is de-
scribed in more detail in (7.27).
♦
Recall that the difference between J(x) in (7.18) and the Lagrangian
in (7.20b) is that we have relaxed the indicator function to a linear func-
tion. Therefore, when λ ⩾0, the Lagrangian L(x, λ) is a lower bound of
J(x). Hence, the maximum of L(x, λ) with respect to λ is
J(x) = max
λ⩾0 L(x, λ) .
(7.25)
Recall that the original problem was minimizing J(x),
min
x∈Rd max
λ⩾0 L(x, λ) .
(7.26)
By the minimax inequality (7.23), it follows that swapping the order of
the minimum and maximum results in a smaller value, i.e.,
min
x∈Rd max
λ⩾0 L(x, λ) ⩾max
λ⩾0 min
x∈Rd L(x, λ) .
(7.27)
This is also known as weak duality. Note that the inner part of the right-
weak duality
hand side is the dual objective function D(λ) and the deﬁnition follows.
In contrast to the original optimization problem, which has constraints,
minx∈Rd L(x, λ) is an unconstrained optimization problem for a given
value of λ. If solving minx∈Rd L(x, λ) is easy, then the overall problem is
easy to solve. We can see this by observing from (7.20b) that L(x, λ) is
afﬁne with respect to λ. Therefore minx∈Rd L(x, λ) is a pointwise min-
imum of afﬁne functions of λ, and hence D(λ) is concave even though
f(·) and gi(·) may be nonconvex. The outer problem, maximization over
λ, is the maximum of a concave function and can be efﬁciently computed.
Assuming f(·) and gi(·) are differentiable, we ﬁnd the Lagrange dual
problem by differentiating the Lagrangian with respect to x, setting the
differential to zero, and solving for the optimal value. We will discuss two
concrete examples in Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2, where f(·) and gi(·) are
convex.

Continuous Optimization
We can model equality constraints by replacing them with two inequality
constraints. That is for each equality constraint hj(x) = 0 we equivalently
replace it by two constraints hj(x) ⩽0 and hj(x) ⩾0. It turns out that
the resulting Lagrange multipliers are then unconstrained.
Therefore, we constrain the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the
inequality constraints in (7.28) to be non-negative, and leave the La-
grange multipliers corresponding to the equality constraints unconstrained.

7.3 Convex Optimization
We focus our attention of a particularly useful class of optimization prob-
lems, where we can guarantee global optimality. When f(·) is a convex
function, and when the constraints involving g(·) and h(·) are convex sets,
this is called a convex optimization problem. In this setting, we have strong

duality: The optimal solution of the dual problem is the same as the opti-
mal solution of the primal problem. The distinction between convex func-
tions and convex sets are often not strictly presented in machine learning
literature, but one can often infer the implied meaning from context.

θ with 0 ⩽θ ⩽1, we have

(7.29)

Convex sets are sets such that a straight line connecting any two ele-
ments of the set lie inside the set. Figures 7.5 and 7.6 illustrate convex
and nonconvex sets, respectively.
Figure 7.6 Example
of a nonconvex set.
Convex functions are functions such that a straight line between any
two points of the function lie above the function. Figure 7.2 shows a non-
convex function, and Figure 7.3 shows a convex function. Another convex
function is shown in Figure 7.7.
Deﬁnition 7.3. Let function f : RD →R be a function whose domain is a
convex set. The function f is a convex function if for all x, y in the domain
convex function
of f, and for any scalar θ with 0 ⩽θ ⩽1, we have
f(θx + (1 −θ)y) ⩽θf(x) + (1 −θ)f(y) .
(7.30)
Remark. A concave function is the negative of a convex function.
♦
concave function
The constraints involving g(·) and h(·) in (7.28) truncate functions at a
scalar value, resulting in sets. Another relation between convex functions
and convex sets is to consider the set obtained by “ﬁlling in” a convex
function. A convex function is a bowl-like object, and we imagine pouring
water into it to ﬁll it up. This resulting ﬁlled-in set, called the epigraph of
epigraph
the convex function, is a convex set.
If a function f : Rn →R is differentiable, we can specify convexity in

terms of its gradient ∇xf(x) (Section 5.2). A function f(x) is convex if
and only if for any two points x, y it holds that
f(y) ⩾f(x) + ∇xf(x)⊤(y −x) .
(7.31)
If we further know that a function f(x) is twice differentiable, that is, the
Hessian (5.147) exists for all values in the domain of x, then the function
f(x) is convex if and only if ∇2
xf(x) is positive semideﬁnite (Boyd and
Vandenberghe, 2004).
Example 7.3
The negative entropy f(x) = x log2 x is convex for x > 0. A visualization
of the function is shown in Figure 7.8, and we can see that the function is
convex. To illustrate the previous deﬁnitions of convexity, let us check the
calculations for two points x = 2 and x = 4. Note that to prove convexity
of f(x) we would need to check for all points x ∈R.
Recall Deﬁnition 7.3. Consider a point midway between the two points
(that is θ = 0.5); then the left-hand side is f(0.5 · 2 + 0.5 · 4) = 3 log2 3 ≈
4.75. The right-hand side is 0.5(2 log2 2) + 0.5(4 log2 4) = 1 + 4 = 5. And
therefore the deﬁnition is satisﬁed.
Since f(x) is differentiable, we can alternatively use (7.31). Calculating
the derivative of f(x), we obtain
∇x(x log2 x) = 1 · log2 x + x ·

x loge 2 = log2 x +

loge 2 .
(7.32)
Using the same two test points x = 2 and x = 4, the left-hand side of
(7.31) is given by f(4) = 8. The right-hand side is
f(x) + ∇⊤
x(y −x) = f(2) + ∇f(2) · (4 −2)

We can check that a function or set is convex from ﬁrst principles by
recalling the deﬁnitions. In practice, we often rely on operations that pre-
serve convexity to check that a particular function or set is convex. Al-
though the details are vastly different, this is again the idea of closure
that we introduced in Chapter 2 for vector spaces.
Example 7.4
A nonnegative weighted sum of convex functions is convex. Observe that
if f is a convex function, and α ⩾0 is a nonnegative scalar, then the
function αf is convex. We can see this by multiplying α to both sides of the
equation in Deﬁnition 7.3, and recalling that multiplying a nonnegative
number does not change the inequality.
If f1 and f2 are convex functions, then we have by the deﬁnition
f1(θx + (1 −θ)y) ⩽θf1(x) + (1 −θ)f1(y)
(7.34)
f2(θx + (1 −θ)y) ⩽θf2(x) + (1 −θ)f2(y) .
(7.35)
Summing up both sides gives us
f1(θx + (1 −θ)y) + f2(θx + (1 −θ)y)
⩽θf1(x) + (1 −θ)f1(y) + θf2(x) + (1 −θ)f2(y) ,
(7.36)
where the right-hand side can be rearranged to
θ(f1(x) + f2(x)) + (1 −θ)(f1(y) + f2(y)) ,
(7.37)
completing the proof that the sum of convex functions is convex.
Combining the preceding two facts, we see that αf1(x) + βf2(x) is
convex for α, β ⩾0. This closure property can be extended using a sim-
ilar argument for nonnegative weighted sums of more than two convex
functions.

where λ ∈Rm is the vector of non-negative Lagrange multipliers. Rear-
ranging the terms corresponding to x yields
L(x, λ) = (c + A⊤λ)⊤x −λ⊤b .
(7.41)
Taking the derivative of L(x, λ) with respect to x and setting it to zero
gives us
c + A⊤λ = 0 .

Therefore, the dual Lagrangian is D(λ) = −λ⊤b. Recall we would like
to maximize D(λ). In addition to the constraint due to the derivative of
L(x, λ) being zero, we also have the fact that λ ⩾0, resulting in the

7.3.3 Legendre-Fenchel Transform and Convex Conjugate
Let us revisit the idea of duality from Section 7.2, without considering
constraints. One useful fact about a convex set is that it can be equiva-
lently described by its supporting hyperplanes. A hyperplane is called a
supporting hyperplane of a convex set if it intersects the convex set, and
supporting
hyperplane
the convex set is contained on just one side of it. Recall that we can ﬁll up
a convex function to obtain the epigraph, which is a convex set. Therefore,
we can also describe convex functions in terms of their supporting hyper-
planes. Furthermore, observe that the supporting hyperplane just touches
the convex function, and is in fact the tangent to the function at that
point. And recall that the tangent of a function f(x) at a given point x0
is the evaluation of the gradient of that function at that point df(x)
dx

x=x0.
In summary, because convex sets can be equivalently described by its sup-
porting hyperplanes, convex functions can be equivalently described by a
function of their gradient. The Legendre transform formalizes this concept.
Legendre transform
Physics students are
often introduced to
the Legendre
transform as
relating the
Lagrangian and the
Hamiltonian in
classical mechanics.
We begin with the most general deﬁnition, which unfortunately has a
counter-intuitive form, and look at special cases to relate the deﬁnition to
the intuition described in the preceding paragraph. The Legendre-Fenchel
Legendre-Fenchel
transform
transform is a transformation (in the sense of a Fourier transform) from
a convex differentiable function f(x) to a function that depends on the
tangents s(x) = ∇xf(x). It is worth stressing that this is a transformation
of the function f(·) and not the variable x or the function evaluated at x.
The Legendre-Fenchel transform is also known as the convex conjugate (for
convex conjugate
reasons we will see soon) and is closely related to duality (Hiriart-Urruty
and Lemar´echal, 2001, chapter 5).

hyperplanes reduce to a line. Consider a line y = sx+c. Recall that we are
able to describe convex functions by their supporting hyperplanes, so let
us try to describe this function f(x) by its supporting lines. Fix the gradi-
ent of the line s ∈R and for each point (x0, f(x0)) on the graph of f, ﬁnd
the minimum value of c such that the line still intersects (x0, f(x0)). Note
that the minimum value of c is the place where a line with slope s “just
touches” the function f(x) = x2. The line passing through (x0, f(x0))
with gradient s is given by
y −f(x0) = s(x −x0) .
(7.54)
The y-intercept of this line is −sx0 + f(x0). The minimum of c for which
y = sx + c intersects with the graph of f is therefore
inf
x0 −sx0 + f(x0) .
(7.55)
The preceding convex conjugate is by convention deﬁned to be the nega-
tive of this. The reasoning in this paragraph did not rely on the fact that
we chose a one-dimensional convex and differentiable function, and holds
for f : RD →R, which are nonconvex and non-differentiable.
The classical
Legendre transform
is deﬁned on convex
differentiable
functions in RD.
Remark. Convex differentiable functions such as the example f(x) = x2 is
a nice special case, where there is no need for the supremum, and there is
a one-to-one correspondence between a function and its Legendre trans-
form. Let us derive this from ﬁrst principles. For a convex differentiable
function, we know that at x0 the tangent touches f(x0) so that
f(x0) = sx0 + c .
(7.56)
Recall that we want to describe the convex function f(x) in terms of its
gradient ∇xf(x), and that s = ∇xf(x0). We rearrange to get an expres-
sion for −c to obtain
−c = sx0 −f(x0) .
(7.57)
Note that −c changes with x0 and therefore with s, which is why we can
think of it as a function of s, which we call
f ∗(s) := sx0 −f(x0) .
(7.58)
Comparing (7.58) with Deﬁnition 7.4, we see that (7.58) is a special case
(without the supremum).
♦
The conjugate function has nice properties; for example, for convex
functions, applying the Legendre transform again gets us back to the orig-
inal function. In the same way that the slope of f(x) is s, the slope of f ∗(s)

in machine learning.
Example 7.7 (Convex Conjugates)
To illustrate the application of convex conjugates, consider the quadratic
function
f(y) = λ
2 y⊤K−1y
(7.59)
based on a positive deﬁnite matrix K ∈Rn×n. We denote the primal
variable to be y ∈Rn and the dual variable to be α ∈Rn.
Applying Deﬁnition 7.4, we obtain the function
f ∗(α) = sup
y∈Rn ⟨y, α⟩−λ
2 y⊤K−1y .
(7.60)
Since the function is differentiable, we can ﬁnd the maximum by taking
the derivative and with respect to y setting it to zero.

Example 7.8
In machine learning, we often use sums of functions; for example, the ob-
jective function of the training set includes a sum of the losses for each ex-
ample in the training set. In the following, we derive the convex conjugate
of a sum of losses ℓ(t), where ℓ: R →R. This also illustrates the appli-
cation of the convex conjugate to the vector case. Let L(t) = Pn

deﬁnition of conjugate
(7.63d)
Recall that in Section 7.2 we derived a dual optimization problem using
Lagrange multipliers. Furthermore, for convex optimization problems we
have strong duality, that is the solutions of the primal and dual problem
match. The Legendre-Fenchel transform described here also can be used
to derive a dual optimization problem. Furthermore, when the function
is convex and differentiable, the supremum is unique. To further investi-
gate the relation between these two approaches, let us consider a linear
equality constrained convex optimization problem.
Example 7.9
Let f(y) and g(x) be convex functions, and A a real matrix of appropriate
dimensions such that Ax = y. Then
min
x f(Ax) + g(x) = min
Ax=y f(y) + g(x).

By introducing the Lagrange multiplier u for the constraints Ax = y,
min

Continuous Optimization
The Legendre-Fenchel conjugate turns out to be quite useful for ma-
chine learning problems that can be expressed as convex optimization
problems. In particular, for convex loss functions that apply independently
to each example, the conjugate loss is a convenient way to derive a dual
problem.
7.4 Further Reading
Continuous optimization is an active area of research, and we do not try
to provide a comprehensive account of recent advances.
From a gradient descent perspective, there are two major weaknesses
which each have their own set of literature. The ﬁrst challenge is the fact
that gradient descent is a ﬁrst-order algorithm, and does not use infor-
mation about the curvature of the surface. When there are long valleys,
the gradient points perpendicularly to the direction of interest. The idea
of momentum can be generalized to a general class of acceleration meth-
ods (Nesterov, 2018). Conjugate gradient methods avoid the issues faced
by gradient descent by taking previous directions into account (Shewchuk,
1994). Second-order methods such as Newton methods use the Hessian to
provide information about the curvature. Many of the choices for choos-
ing step-sizes and ideas like momentum arise by considering the curvature
of the objective function (Goh, 2017; Bottou et al., 2018). Quasi-Newton
methods such as L-BFGS try to use cheaper computational methods to ap-
proximate the Hessian (Nocedal and Wright, 2006). Recently there has
been interest in other metrics for computing descent directions, result-
ing in approaches such as mirror descent (Beck and Teboulle, 2003) and
natural gradient (Toussaint, 2012).
The second challenge is to handle non-differentiable functions. Gradi-
ent methods are not well deﬁned when there are kinks in the function.
In these cases, subgradient methods can be used (Shor, 1985). For fur-
ther information and algorithms for optimizing non-differentiable func-
tions, we refer to the book by Bertsekas (1999). There is a vast amount
of literature on different approaches for numerically solving continuous
optimization problems, including algorithms for constrained optimization
problems. Good starting points to appreciate this literature are the books
by Luenberger (1969) and Bonnans et al. (2006). A recent survey of con-
tinuous optimization is provided by Bubeck (2015).

Modern applications of machine learning often mean that the size of
datasets prohibit the use of batch gradient descent, and hence stochastic
gradient descent is the current workhorse of large-scale machine learning
methods. Recent surveys of the literature include Hazan (2015) and Bot-
tou et al. (2018).
For duality and convex optimization, the book by Boyd and Vanden-
berghe (2004) includes lectures and slides online. A more mathematical

in more foundational results about convex functions is referred to Rock-
afellar (1970), Hiriart-Urruty and Lemar´echal (2001), and Borwein and
Lewis (2006). Legendre–Fenchel transforms are also covered in the afore-
mentioned books on convex analysis, but a more beginner-friendly pre-
sentation is available at Zia et al. (2009). The role of Legendre–Fenchel
transforms in the analysis of convex optimization algorithms is surveyed
in Polyak (2016).

When Models Meet Data
In the ﬁrst part of the book, we introduced the mathematics that form
the foundations of many machine learning methods. The hope is that a
reader would be able to learn the rudimentary forms of the language of
mathematics from the ﬁrst part, which we will now use to describe and
discuss machine learning. The second part of the book introduces four
pillars of machine learning:
Regression (Chapter 9)
Dimensionality reduction (Chapter 10)
Density estimation (Chapter 11)
Classiﬁcation (Chapter 12)
The main aim of this part of the book is to illustrate how the mathematical
concepts introduced in the ﬁrst part of the book can be used to design
machine learning algorithms that can be used to solve tasks within the
remit of the four pillars. We do not intend to introduce advanced machine
learning concepts, but instead to provide a set of practical methods that
allow the reader to apply the knowledge they gained from the ﬁrst part
of the book. It also provides a gateway to the wider machine learning
literature for readers already familiar with the mathematics.
8.1 Data, Models, and Learning
It is worth at this point, to pause and consider the problem that a ma-
chine learning algorithm is designed to solve. As discussed in Chapter 1,
there are three major components of a machine learning system: data,
models, and learning. The main question of machine learning is “What do
we mean by good models?”. The word model has many subtleties, and we

will revisit it multiple times in this chapter. It is also not entirely obvious
how to objectively deﬁne the word “good”. One of the guiding principles
of machine learning is that good models should perform well on unseen
data. This requires us to deﬁne some performance metrics, such as accu-
racy or distance from ground truth, as well as ﬁguring out ways to do well
under these performance metrics. This chapter covers a few necessary bits
and pieces of mathematical and statistical language that are commonly

used to talk about machine learning models. By doing so, we brieﬂy out-
line the current best practices for training a model such that the resulting
predictor does well on data that we have not yet seen.
As mentioned in Chapter 1, there are two different senses in which we
use the phrase “machine learning algorithm”: training and prediction. We
will describe these ideas in this chapter, as well as the idea of selecting
among different models. We will introduce the framework of empirical
risk minimization in Section 8.2, the principle of maximum likelihood in
Section 8.3, and the idea of probabilistic models in Section 8.4. We brieﬂy
outline a graphical language for specifying probabilistic models in Sec-
tion 8.5 and ﬁnally discuss model selection in Section 8.6. The rest of this
section expands upon the three main components of machine learning:
data, models and learning.
8.1.1 Data as Vectors
We assume that our data can be read by a computer, and represented ade-
quately in a numerical format. Data is assumed to be tabular (Figure 8.1),
where we think of each row of the table as representing a particular in-
stance or example, and each column to be a particular feature. In recent
Data is assumed to

format (Wickham,
2014; Codd, 1990).
years, machine learning has been applied to many types of data that do not
obviously come in the tabular numerical format, for example genomic se-
quences, text and image contents of a webpage, and social media graphs.
We do not discuss the important and challenging aspects of identifying
good features. Many of these aspects depend on domain expertise and re-
quire careful engineering, and, in recent years, they have been put under
the umbrella of data science (Stray, 2016; Adhikari and DeNero, 2018).
Even when we have data in tabular format, there are still choices to be
made to obtain a numerical representation. For example, in Table 8.1, the
gender column (a categorical variable) may be converted into numbers 0
representing “Male” and 1 representing “Female”. Alternatively, the gen-
der could be represented by numbers −1, +1, respectively (as shown in
Table 8.2). Furthermore, it is often important to use domain knowledge
when constructing the representation, such as knowing that university
degrees progress from bachelor’s to master’s to PhD or realizing that the
postcode provided is not just a string of characters but actually encodes
an area in London. In Table 8.2, we converted the data from Table 8.1
to a numerical format, and each postcode is represented as two numbers,

a latitude and longitude. Even numerical data that could potentially be
directly read into a machine learning algorithm should be carefully con-
sidered for units, scaling, and constraints. Without additional information,
one should shift and scale all columns of the dataset such that they have
an empirical mean of 0 and an empirical variance of 1. For the purposes
of this book, we assume that a domain expert already converted data ap-
propriately, i.e., each input xn is a D-dimensional vector of real numbers,
which are called features, attributes, or covariates. We consider a dataset to
feature
attribute
covariate
be of the form as illustrated by Table 8.2. Observe that we have dropped
the Name column of Table 8.1 in the new numerical representation. There
are two main reasons why this is desirable: (1) we do not expect the iden-
tiﬁer (the Name) to be informative for a machine learning task; and (2)
we may wish to anonymize the data to help protect the privacy of the
employees.
In this part of the book, we will use N to denote the number of exam-
ples in a dataset and index the examples with lowercase n = 1, . . . , N.
We assume that we are given a set of numerical data, represented as an
array of vectors (Table 8.2). Each row is a particular individual xn, often
referred to as an example or data point in machine learning. The subscript
example
data point
n refers to the fact that this is the nth example out of a total of N exam-
ples in the dataset. Each column represents a particular feature of interest
about the example, and we index the features as d = 1, . . . , D. Recall that
data is represented as vectors, which means that each example (each data
point) is a D-dimensional vector. The orientation of the table originates
from the database community, but for some machine learning algorithms
(e.g., in Chapter 10) it is more convenient to represent examples as col-
umn vectors.
Let us consider the problem of predicting annual salary from age, based
on the data in Table 8.2. This is called a supervised learning problem
where we have a label yn (the salary) associated with each example xn
label
(the age). The label yn has various other names, including target, re-
sponse variable, and annotation. A dataset is written as a set of example-
label pairs {(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn), . . . , (xN, yN)}. The table of examples
{x1, . . . , xN} is often concatenated, and written as X ∈RN×D. Fig-
ure 8.1 illustrates the dataset consisting of the two rightmost columns
of Table 8.2, where x = age and y = salary.
We use the concepts introduced in the ﬁrst part of the book to formalize

the machine learning problems such as that in the previous paragraph.
Representing data as vectors xn allows us to use concepts from linear al-
gebra (introduced in Chapter 2). In many machine learning algorithms,
we need to additionally be able to compare two vectors. As we will see in
Chapters 9 and 12, computing the similarity or distance between two ex-
amples allows us to formalize the intuition that examples with similar fea-
tures should have similar labels. The comparison of two vectors requires
that we construct a geometry (explained in Chapter 3) and allows us to
optimize the resulting learning problem using techniques from Chapter 7.
Since we have vector representations of data, we can manipulate data to
ﬁnd potentially better representations of it. We will discuss ﬁnding good
representations in two ways: ﬁnding lower-dimensional approximations
of the original feature vector, and using nonlinear higher-dimensional
combinations of the original feature vector. In Chapter 10, we will see an
example of ﬁnding a low-dimensional approximation of the original data
space by ﬁnding the principal components. Finding principal components
is closely related to concepts of eigenvalue and singular value decomposi-
tion as introduced in Chapter 4. For the high-dimensional representation,
we will see an explicit feature map φ(·) that allows us to represent in-
feature map
puts xn using a higher-dimensional representation φ(xn). The main mo-
tivation for higher-dimensional representations is that we can construct
new features as non-linear combinations of the original features, which in
turn may make the learning problem easier. We will discuss the feature
map in Section 9.2 and show how this feature map leads to a kernel in
kernel
Section 12.4. In recent years, deep learning methods (Goodfellow et al.,
2016) have shown promise in using the data itself to learn new good fea-
tures and have been very successful in areas, such as computer vision,
speech recognition, and natural language processing. We will not cover
neural networks in this part of the book, but the reader is referred to

8.1.2 Models as Functions
Once we have data in an appropriate vector representation, we can get to
the business of constructing a predictive function (known as a predictor).
predictor
In Chapter 1, we did not yet have the language to be precise about models.
Using the concepts from the ﬁrst part of the book, we can now introduce
what “model” means. We present two major approaches in this book: a
predictor as a function, and a predictor as a probabilistic model. We de-
scribe the former here and the latter in the next subsection.
A predictor is a function that, when given a particular input example
(in our case, a vector of features), produces an output. For now, consider
the output to be a single number, i.e., a real-valued scalar output. This can
be written as
f : RD →R ,
(8.1)
where the input vector x is D-dimensional (has D features), and the func-
tion f then applied to it (written as f(x)) returns a real number. Fig-
ure 8.2 illustrates a possible function that can be used to compute the
value of the prediction for input values x.
In this book, we do not consider the general case of all functions, which
would involve the need for functional analysis. Instead, we consider the
special case of linear functions
f(x) = θ⊤x + θ0
(8.2)
for unknown θ and θ0. This restriction means that the contents of Chap-
ters 2 and 3 sufﬁce for precisely stating the notion of a predictor for
the non-probabilistic (in contrast to the probabilistic view described next)

view of machine learning. Linear functions strike a good balance between
the generality of the problems that can be solved and the amount of back-
ground mathematics that is needed.
8.1.3 Models as Probability Distributions
We often consider data to be noisy observations of some true underlying
effect, and hope that by applying machine learning we can identify the
signal from the noise. This requires us to have a language for quantify-
ing the effect of noise. We often would also like to have predictors that
express some sort of uncertainty, e.g., to quantify the conﬁdence we have
about the value of the prediction for a particular test data point. As we
have seen in Chapter 6, probability theory provides a language for quan-
tifying uncertainty. Figure 8.3 illustrates the predictive uncertainty of the
function as a Gaussian distribution.
Instead of considering a predictor as a single function, we could con-
sider predictors to be probabilistic models, i.e., models describing the dis-
tribution of possible functions. We limit ourselves in this book to the spe-
cial case of distributions with ﬁnite-dimensional parameters, which allows
us to describe probabilistic models without needing stochastic processes
and random measures. For this special case, we can think about prob-
abilistic models as multivariate probability distributions, which already
allow for a rich class of models.
We will introduce how to use concepts from probability (Chapter 6) to
deﬁne machine learning models in Section 8.4, and introduce a graphical
language for describing probabilistic models in a compact way in Sec-
tion 8.5.

8.1 Data, Models, and Learning
257
8.1.4 Learning is Finding Parameters
The goal of learning is to ﬁnd a model and its corresponding parame-
ters such that the resulting predictor will perform well on unseen data.
There are conceptually three distinct algorithmic phases when discussing
machine learning algorithms:
1. Prediction or inference
2. Training or parameter estimation
3. Hyperparameter tuning or model selection
The prediction phase is when we use a trained predictor on previously un-
seen test data. In other words, the parameters and model choice is already
ﬁxed and the predictor is applied to new vectors representing new input
data points. As outlined in Chapter 1 and the previous subsection, we will
consider two schools of machine learning in this book, corresponding to
whether the predictor is a function or a probabilistic model. When we
have a probabilistic model (discussed further in Section 8.4) the predic-
tion phase is called inference.
Remark. Unfortunately, there is no agreed upon naming for the different
algorithmic phases. The word “inference” is sometimes also used to mean
parameter estimation of a probabilistic model, and less often may be also
used to mean prediction for non-probabilistic models.
♦
The training or parameter estimation phase is when we adjust our pre-
dictive model based on training data. We would like to ﬁnd good predic-
tors given training data, and there are two main strategies for doing so:
ﬁnding the best predictor based on some measure of quality (sometimes
called ﬁnding a point estimate), or using Bayesian inference. Finding a
point estimate can be applied to both types of predictors, but Bayesian
inference requires probabilistic models.
For the non-probabilistic model, we follow the principle of empirical risk

minimization, which we describe in Section 8.2. Empirical risk minimiza-
tion directly provides an optimization problem for ﬁnding good parame-
ters. With a statistical model, the principle of maximum likelihood is used
maximum likelihood
to ﬁnd a good set of parameters (Section 8.3). We can additionally model
the uncertainty of parameters using a probabilistic model, which we will
look at in more detail in Section 8.4.
We use numerical methods to ﬁnd good parameters that “ﬁt” the data,
and most training methods can be thought of as hill-climbing approaches
to ﬁnd the maximum of an objective, for example the maximum of a likeli-
hood. To apply hill-climbing approaches we use the gradients described in

on data such that it performs well on future data. It is not enough for

the model to only ﬁt the training data well, the predictor needs to per-
form well on unseen data. We simulate the behavior of our predictor on
future unseen data using cross-validation (Section 8.2.4). As we will see
cross-validation
in this chapter, to achieve the goal of performing well on unseen data,
we will need to balance between ﬁtting well on training data and ﬁnding
“simple” explanations of the phenomenon. This trade-off is achieved us-
ing regularization (Section 8.2.3) or by adding a prior (Section 8.3.2). In
philosophy, this is considered to be neither induction nor deduction, but
is called abduction. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy,
abduction
abduction is the process of inference to the best explanation (Douven,
2017).
A good movie title is
“AI abduction”.
We often need to make high-level modeling decisions about the struc-
ture of the predictor, such as the number of components to use or the
class of probability distributions to consider. The choice of the number of
components is an example of a hyperparameter, and this choice can af-

among different models is called model selection, which we describe in

Section 8.6. For non-probabilistic models, model selection is often done
using nested cross-validation, which is described in Section 8.6.1. We also

use model selection to choose hyperparameters of our model.
Remark. The distinction between parameters and hyperparameters is some-
what arbitrary, and is mostly driven by the distinction between what can
be numerically optimized versus what needs to use search techniques.
Another way to consider the distinction is to consider parameters as the
explicit parameters of a probabilistic model, and to consider hyperparam-
eters (higher-level parameters) as parameters that control the distribution
of these explicit parameters.
♦
In the following sections, we will look at three ﬂavors of machine learn-
ing: empirical risk minimization (Section 8.2), the principle of maximum
likelihood (Section 8.3), and probabilistic modeling (Section 8.4).
8.2 Empirical Risk Minimization
After having all the mathematics under our belt, we are now in a posi-
tion to introduce what it means to learn. The “learning” part of machine
learning boils down to estimating parameters based on training data.
In this section, we consider the case of a predictor that is a function,
and consider the case of probabilistic models in Section 8.3. We describe
the idea of empirical risk minimization, which was originally popularized
by the proposal of the support vector machine (described in Chapter 12).
However, its general principles are widely applicable and allow us to ask
the question of what is learning without explicitly constructing probabilis-
tic models. There are four main design choices, which we will cover in
detail in the following subsections:

Section 8.2.2 How do we measure how well the predictor performs on
the training data?
Section 8.2.3 How do we construct predictors from only training data
that performs well on unseen test data?
Section 8.2.4 What is the procedure for searching over the space of mod-
els?
8.2.1 Hypothesis Class of Functions
Assume we are given N examples xn ∈RD and corresponding scalar la-
bels yn ∈R. We consider the supervised learning setting, where we obtain
pairs (x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN). Given this data, we would like to estimate a
predictor f(·, θ) : RD →R, parametrized by θ. We hope to be able to ﬁnd
a good parameter θ∗such that we ﬁt the data well, that is,
f(xn, θ∗) ≈yn
for all
n = 1, . . . , N .
(8.3)
In this section, we use the notation ˆyn = f(xn, θ∗) to represent the output
of the predictor.
Remark. For ease of presentation, we will describe empirical risk mini-
mization in terms of supervised learning (where we have labels). This
simpliﬁes the deﬁnition of the hypothesis class and the loss function. It
is also common in machine learning to choose a parametrized class of
functions, for example afﬁne functions.
♦
Example 8.1
We introduce the problem of ordinary least-squares regression to illustrate
empirical risk minimization. A more comprehensive account of regression
is given in Chapter 9. When the label yn is real-valued, a popular choice
of function class for predictors is the set of afﬁne functions. We choose a

previous ﬁgures in this chapter had a straight line as a predictor, which
means that we have assumed an afﬁne function.
Instead of a linear function, we may wish to consider non-linear func-
tions as predictors. Recent advances in neural networks allow for efﬁcient
computation of more complex non-linear function classes.
Given the class of functions, we want to search for a good predictor.
We now move on to the second ingredient of empirical risk minimization:
how to measure how well the predictor ﬁts the training data.
8.2.2 Loss Function for Training
Consider the label yn for a particular example; and the corresponding pre-
diction ˆyn that we make based on xn. To deﬁne what it means to ﬁt the
data well, we need to specify a loss function ℓ(yn, ˆyn) that takes the ground

ber (referred to as the loss) representing how much error we have made
on this particular prediction. Our goal for ﬁnding a good parameter vector

points (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) do not statistically depend on each other, mean-

loss on the training data. For a given training set {(x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN)},

We are not interested in a predictor that only performs well on the

our desire to minimize expected risk, which we address in the following
two subsections:
How should we change our training procedure to generalize well?
How do we estimate expected risk from (ﬁnite) data?
Remark. Many machine learning tasks are speciﬁed with an associated
performance measure, e.g., accuracy of prediction or root mean squared
error. The performance measure could be more complex, be cost sensitive,
and capture details about the particular application. In principle, the de-
sign of the loss function for empirical risk minimization should correspond
directly to the performance measure speciﬁed by the machine learning
task. In practice, there is often a mismatch between the design of the loss
function and the performance measure. This could be due to issues such
as ease of implementation or efﬁciency of optimization.

8.2.3 Regularization to Reduce Overﬁtting
This section describes an addition to empirical risk minimization that al-
lows it to generalize well (approximately minimizing expected risk). Re-
call that the aim of training a machine learning predictor is so that we can
perform well on unseen data, i.e., the predictor generalizes well. We sim-
ulate this unseen data by holding out a proportion of the whole dataset.
This hold out set is referred to as the test set. Given a sufﬁciently rich class

and Hardt, 2015).
of functions for the predictor f, we can essentially memorize the training
data to obtain zero empirical risk. While this is great to minimize the loss
(and therefore the risk) on the training data, we would not expect the
predictor to generalize well to unseen data. In practice, we have only a
ﬁnite set of data, and hence we split our data into a training and a test
set. The training set is used to ﬁt the model, and the test set (not seen
by the machine learning algorithm during training) is used to evaluate
generalization performance. It is important for the user to not cycle back
to a new round of training after having observed the test set. We use the
subscripts train and test to denote the training and test sets, respectively.
We will revisit this idea of using a ﬁnite dataset to evaluate expected risk
in Section 8.2.4.
It turns out that empirical risk minimization can lead to overﬁtting, i.e.,
overﬁtting
the predictor ﬁts too closely to the training data and does not general-
ize well to new data (Mitchell, 1997). This general phenomenon of hav-
ing very small average loss on the training set but large average loss on
the test set tends to occur when we have little data and a complex hy-
pothesis class. For a particular predictor f (with parameters ﬁxed), the
phenomenon of overﬁtting occurs when the risk estimate from the train-
ing data Remp(f, Xtrain, ytrain) underestimates the expected risk Rtrue(f).
Since we estimate the expected risk Rtrue(f) by using the empirical risk
on the test set Remp(f, Xtest, ytest) if the test risk is much larger than
the training risk, this is an indication of overﬁtting. We revisit the idea of
overﬁtting in Section 8.3.3.
Therefore, we need to somehow bias the search for the minimizer of
empirical risk by introducing a penalty term, which makes it harder for
the optimizer to return an overly ﬂexible predictor. In machine learning,
the penalty term is referred to as regularization. Regularization is a way
regularization
to compromise between accurate solution of empirical risk minimization
and the size or complexity of the solution.
Example 8.3 (Regularized Least Squares)
Regularization is an approach that discourages complex or extreme solu-
tions to an optimization problem. The simplest regularization strategy is

off minimizing the loss on the training set and the magnitude of the pa-
rameters θ. It often happens that the magnitude of the parameter values
becomes relatively large if we run into overﬁtting (Bishop, 2006).
The regularization term is sometimes called the penalty term, which bi-
penalty term
ases the vector θ to be closer to the origin. The idea of regularization also
appears in probabilistic models as the prior probability of the parameters.
Recall from Section 6.6 that for the posterior distribution to be of the same
form as the prior distribution, the prior and the likelihood need to be con-
jugate. We will revisit this idea in Section 8.3.2. We will see in Chapter 12
that the idea of the regularizer is equivalent to the idea of a large margin.
8.2.4 Cross-Validation to Assess the Generalization Performance
We mentioned in the previous section that we measure the generalization
error by estimating it by applying the predictor on test data. This data is
also sometimes referred to as the validation set. The validation set is a sub-
validation set
set of the available training data that we keep aside. A practical issue with
this approach is that the amount of data is limited, and ideally we would
use as much of the data available to train the model. This would require
us to keep our validation set V small, which then would lead to a noisy
estimate (with high variance) of the predictive performance. One solu-
tion to these contradictory objectives (large training set, large validation
set) is to use cross-validation. K-fold cross-validation effectively partitions
cross-validation
the data into K chunks, K −1 of which form the training set R, and
the last chunk serves as the validation set V (similar to the idea outlined
previously). Cross-validation iterates through (ideally) all combinations
of assignments of chunks to R and V; see Figure 8.4. This procedure is
repeated for all K choices for the validation set, and the performance of
the model from the K runs is averaged.
We partition our dataset into two sets D = R∪V, such that they do not
overlap (R ∩V = ∅), where V is the validation set, and train our model
on R. After training, we assess the performance of the predictor f on the

to validation set V(k) to compute the empirical risk R(f (k), V(k)). We cycle
through all possible partitionings of validation and training sets and com-
pute the average generalization error of the predictor. Cross-validation

training set, which results in not the best possible f (k); and second, due to
the ﬁnite validation set, which results in an inaccurate estimation of the
risk R(f (k), V(k)). A potential disadvantage of K-fold cross-validation is
the computational cost of training the model K times, which can be bur-
densome if the training cost is computationally expensive. In practice, it
is often not sufﬁcient to look at the direct parameters alone. For example,
we need to explore multiple complexity parameters (e.g., multiple regu-
larization parameters), which may not be direct parameters of the model.
Evaluating the quality of the model, depending on these hyperparameters,
may result in a number of training runs that is exponential in the number
of model parameters. One can use nested cross-validation (Section 8.6.1)
to search for good hyperparameters.
However, cross-validation is an embarrassingly parallel problem, i.e., lit-
embarrassingly

tle effort is needed to separate the problem into a number of parallel
tasks. Given sufﬁcient computing resources (e.g., cloud computing, server
farms), cross-validation does not require longer than a single performance
assessment.
In this section, we saw that empirical risk minimization is based on the
following concepts: the hypothesis class of functions, the loss function and
regularization. In Section 8.3, we will see the effect of using a probability
distribution to replace the idea of loss functions and regularization.

8.2.5 Further Reading
Due to the fact that the original development of empirical risk minimiza-
tion (Vapnik, 1998) was couched in heavily theoretical language, many
of the subsequent developments have been theoretical. The area of study
is called statistical learning theory (Vapnik, 1999; Evgeniou et al., 2000;
statistical learning
theory
Hastie et al., 2001; von Luxburg and Sch¨olkopf, 2011). A recent machine
learning textbook that builds on the theoretical foundations and develops
efﬁcient learning algorithms is Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David (2014).
The concept of regularization has its roots in the solution of ill-posed in-
verse problems (Neumaier, 1998). The approach presented here is called
Tikhonov regularization, and there is a closely related constrained version
Tikhonov
regularization
called Ivanov regularization. Tikhonov regularization has deep relation-
ships to the bias-variance trade-off and feature selection (B¨uhlmann and
Van De Geer, 2011). An alternative to cross-validation is bootstrap and
jackknife (Efron and Tibshirani, 1993; Davidson and Hinkley, 1997; Hall,
1992).
Thinking about empirical risk minimization (Section 8.2) as “probabil-
ity free” is incorrect. There is an underlying unknown probability distri-
bution p(x, y) that governs the data generation. However, the approach
of empirical risk minimization is agnostic to that choice of distribution.
This is in contrast to standard statistical approaches that explicitly re-
quire the knowledge of p(x, y). Furthermore, since the distribution is a
joint distribution on both examples x and labels y, the labels can be non-
deterministic. In contrast to standard statistics we do not need to specify
the noise distribution for the labels y.
8.3 Parameter Estimation
In Section 8.2, we did not explicitly model our problem using probability
distributions. In this section, we will see how to use probability distribu-
tions to model our uncertainty due to the observation process and our
uncertainty in the parameters of our predictors. In Section 8.3.1, we in-
troduce the likelihood, which is analogous to the concept of loss functions
(Section 8.2.2) in empirical risk minimization. The concept of priors (Sec-
tion 8.3.2) is analogous to the concept of regularization (Section 8.2.3).
8.3.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation
The idea behind maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is to deﬁne a func-

tion of the parameters that enables us to ﬁnd a model that ﬁts the data
well. The estimation problem is focused on the likelihood function, or

more precisely its negative logarithm. For data represented by a random
variable x and for a family of probability densities p(x | θ) parametrized
by θ, the negative log-likelihood is given by

When Models Meet Data
Lx(θ) = −log p(x | θ) .
(8.14)
The notation Lx(θ) emphasizes the fact that the parameter θ is varying
and the data x is ﬁxed. We very often drop the reference to x when writing
the negative log-likelihood, as it is really a function of θ, and write it as
L(θ) when the random variable representing the uncertainty in the data
is clear from the context.
Let us interpret what the probability density p(x | θ) is modeling for a
ﬁxed value of θ. It is a distribution that models the uncertainty of the data.
In other words, once we have chosen the type of function we want as a
predictor, the likelihood provides the probability of observing data x.
In a complementary view, if we consider the data to be ﬁxed (because
it has been observed), and we vary the parameters θ, what does L(θ) tell
us? It tells us how likely a particular setting of θ is for the observations x.
Based on this second view, the maximum likelihood estimator gives us the
most likely parameter θ for the set of data.
We consider the supervised learning setting, where we obtain pairs
(x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN) with xn ∈RD and labels yn ∈R. We are inter-
ested in constructing a predictor that takes a feature vector xn as input
and produces a prediction yn (or something close to it), i.e., given a vec-
tor xn we want the probability distribution of the label yn. In other words,
we specify the conditional probability distribution of the labels given the
examples for the particular parameter setting θ.
Example 8.4
The ﬁrst example that is often used is to specify that the conditional
probability of the labels given the examples is a Gaussian distribution. In
other words, we assume that we can explain our observation uncertainty
by independent Gaussian noise (refer to Section 6.5) with zero mean,
εn ∼N

. We further assume that the linear model x⊤
n θ is used for
prediction. This means we specify a Gaussian likelihood for each example

An illustration of a Gaussian likelihood for a given parameter θ is shown
in Figure 8.3. We will see in Section 9.2 how to explicitly expand the
preceding expression out in terms of the Gaussian distribution.

where p(yn | xn, θ) is a particular distribution (which was Gaussian in Ex-
ample 8.4). The expression “identically distributed” means that each term
in the product (8.16) is of the same distribution, and all of them share
the same parameters. It is often easier from an optimization viewpoint to
compute functions that can be decomposed into sums of simpler functions.
Hence, in machine learning we often consider the negative log-likelihood

While it is temping to interpret the fact that θ is on the right of the condi-
tioning in p(yn|xn, θ) (8.15), and hence should be interpreted as observed
and ﬁxed, this interpretation is incorrect. The negative log-likelihood L(θ)
is a function of θ. Therefore, to ﬁnd a good parameter vector θ that
explains the data (x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN) well, minimize the negative log-
likelihood L(θ) with respect to θ.
Remark. The negative sign in (8.17) is a historical artifact that is due
to the convention that we want to maximize likelihood, but numerical
optimization literature tends to study minimization of functions.

problem corresponding to maximum likelihood estimation has a closed-
form solution. We will see more details on this in Chapter 9. Figure 8.5
shows a regression dataset and the function that is induced by the maxi-
mum-likelihood parameters. Maximum likelihood estimation may suffer
from overﬁtting (Section 8.3.3), analogous to unregularized empirical risk
minimization (Section 8.2.3). For other likelihood functions, i.e., if we
model our noise with non-Gaussian distributions, maximum likelihood es-
timation may not have a closed-form analytic solution. In this case, we
resort to numerical optimization methods discussed in Chapter 7.
8.3.2 Maximum A Posteriori Estimation
If we have prior knowledge about the distribution of the parameters θ, we
can multiply an additional term to the likelihood. This additional term is
a prior probability distribution on parameters p(θ). For a given prior, after

other words, how should we represent the fact that we have more speciﬁc
knowledge of θ after observing data x? Bayes’ theorem, as discussed in
Section 6.3, gives us a principled tool to update our probability distribu-
tions of random variables. It allows us to compute a posterior distribution

(8.19)
Recall that we are interested in ﬁnding the parameter θ that maximizes
the posterior. Since the distribution p(x) does not depend on θ, we can
ignore the value of the denominator for the optimization and obtain
p(θ | x) ∝p(x | θ)p(θ) .
(8.20)
The preceding proportion relation hides the density of the data p(x),
which may be difﬁcult to estimate. Instead of estimating the minimum
of the negative log-likelihood, we now estimate the minimum of the neg-
ative log-posterior, which is referred to as maximum a posteriori estima-

Gaussian with zero mean, i.e., p(θ) = N

, where Σ is the covari-
ance matrix (Section 6.5). Note that the conjugate prior of a Gaussian
is also a Gaussian (Section 6.6.1), and therefore we expect the posterior
distribution to also be a Gaussian. We will see the details of maximum a
posteriori estimation in Chapter 9.
The idea of including prior knowledge about where good parameters
lie is widespread in machine learning. An alternative view, which we saw
in Section 8.2.3, is the idea of regularization, which introduces an addi-
tional term that biases the resulting parameters to be close to the origin.
Maximum a posteriori estimation can be considered to bridge the non-
probabilistic and probabilistic worlds as it explicitly acknowledges the
need for a prior distribution but it still only produces a point estimate
of the parameters.

The size of the samples necessary to achieve these properties can be
quite large.
The error’s variance decays in 1/N, where N is the number of data

Especially, in the “small” data regime, maximum likelihood estimation
can lead to overﬁtting.
♦
The principle of maximum likelihood estimation (and maximum a pos-
teriori estimation) uses probabilistic modeling to reason about the uncer-
tainty in the data and model parameters. However, we have not yet taken
probabilistic modeling to its full extent. In this section, the resulting train-
ing procedure still produces a point estimate of the predictor, i.e., training
returns one single set of parameter values that represent the best predic-
tor. In Section 8.4, we will take the view that the parameter values should
also be treated as random variables, and instead of estimating “best” val-
ues of that distribution, we will use the full parameter distribution when
making predictions.
8.3.3 Model Fitting
Consider the setting where we are given a dataset, and we are interested
in ﬁtting a parametrized model to the data. When we talk about “ﬁt-
ting”, we typically mean optimizing/learning model parameters so that
they minimize some loss function, e.g., the negative log-likelihood. With
maximum likelihood (Section 8.3.1) and maximum a posteriori estima-
tion (Section 8.3.2), we already discussed two commonly used algorithms
for model ﬁtting.
The parametrization of the model deﬁnes a model class Mθ with which
we can operate. For example, in a linear regression setting, we may deﬁne
the relationship between inputs x and (noise-free) observations y to be
y = ax + b, where θ := {a, b} are the model parameters. In this case, the
model parameters θ describe the family of afﬁne functions, i.e., straight
lines with slope a, which are offset from 0 by b. Assume the data comes

from a model M ∗, which is unknown to us. For a given training dataset,
we optimize θ so that Mθ is as close as possible to M ∗, where the “close-
ness” is deﬁned by the objective function we optimize (e.g., squared loss
on the training data). Figure 8.7 illustrates a setting where we have a small
model class (indicated by the circle Mθ), and the data generation model
M ∗lies outside the set of considered models. We begin our parameter
search at Mθ0. After the optimization, i.e., when we obtain the best pos-
sible parameters θ∗, we distinguish three different cases: (i) overﬁtting,
(ii) underﬁtting, and (iii) ﬁtting well. We will give a high-level intuition
of what these three concepts mean.
Roughly speaking, overﬁtting refers to the situation where the para-
overﬁtting
metrized model class is too rich to model the dataset generated by M ∗,
i.e., Mθ could model much more complicated datasets. For instance, if the
dataset was generated by a linear function, and we deﬁne Mθ to be the
class of seventh-order polynomials, we could model not only linear func-
tions, but also polynomials of degree two, three, etc. Models that over-
ﬁt typically have a large number of parameters. An observation we often

make is that the overly ﬂexible model class Mθ uses all its modeling power
to reduce the training error. If the training data is noisy, it will therefore
ﬁnd some useful signal in the noise itself. This will cause enormous prob-
lems when we predict away from the training data. Figure 8.8(a) gives an
example of overﬁtting in the context of regression where the model pa-
rameters are learned by means of maximum likelihood (see Section 8.3.1).
We will discuss overﬁtting in regression more in Section 9.2.2.
When we run into underﬁtting, we encounter the opposite problem
underﬁtting
where the model class Mθ is not rich enough. For example, if our dataset
was generated by a sinusoidal function, but θ only parametrizes straight
lines, the best optimization procedure will not get us close to the true
model. However, we still optimize the parameters and ﬁnd the best straight
line that models the dataset. Figure 8.8(b) shows an example of a model
that underﬁts because it is insufﬁciently ﬂexible. Models that underﬁt typ-
ically have few parameters.
The third case is when the parametrized model class is about right.
Then, our model ﬁts well, i.e., it neither overﬁts nor underﬁts. This means
our model class is just rich enough to describe the dataset we are given.
Figure 8.8(c) shows a model that ﬁts the given dataset fairly well. Ideally,

When Models Meet Data
this is the model class we would want to work with since it has good
generalization properties.
In practice, we often deﬁne very rich model classes Mθ with many pa-
rameters, such as deep neural networks. To mitigate the problem of over-
ﬁtting, we can use regularization (Section 8.2.3) or priors (Section 8.3.2).
We will discuss how to choose the model class in Section 8.6.
8.3.4 Further Reading
When considering probabilistic models, the principle of maximum likeli-
hood estimation generalizes the idea of least-squares regression for linear
models, which we will discuss in detail in Chapter 9. When restricting
the predictor to have linear form with an additional nonlinear function ϕ
applied to the output, i.e.,
p(yn|xn, θ) = ϕ(θ⊤xn) ,
(8.21)
we can consider other models for other prediction tasks, such as binary
classiﬁcation or modeling count data (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). An
alternative view of this is to consider likelihoods that are from the ex-
ponential family (Section 6.6). The class of models, which have linear
dependence between parameters and data, and have potentially nonlin-
ear transformation ϕ (called a link function), is referred to as generalized
link function
generalized linear
model
linear models (Agresti, 2002, chapter 4).
Maximum likelihood estimation has a rich history, and was originally
proposed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1930s. We will expand upon the idea
of a probabilistic model in Section 8.4. One debate among researchers
who use probabilistic models, is the discussion between Bayesian and fre-
quentist statistics. As mentioned in Section 6.1.1, it boils down to the
deﬁnition of probability. Recall from Section 6.1 that one can consider
probability to be a generalization (by allowing uncertainty) of logical rea-
soning (Cheeseman, 1985; Jaynes, 2003). The method of maximum like-
lihood estimation is frequentist in nature, and the interested reader is
pointed to Efron and Hastie (2016) for a balanced view of both Bayesian
and frequentist statistics.
There are some probabilistic models where maximum likelihood esti-
mation may not be possible. The reader is referred to more advanced sta-
tistical textbooks, e.g., Casella and Berger (2002), for approaches, such as
method of moments, M-estimation, and estimating equations.
8.4 Probabilistic Modeling and Inference
In machine learning, we are frequently concerned with the interpretation
and analysis of data, e.g., for prediction of future events and decision
making. To make this task more tractable, we often build models that
describe the generative process that generates the observed data.

8.4 Probabilistic Modeling and Inference
273
For example, we can describe the outcome of a coin-ﬂip experiment
(“heads” or “tails”) in two steps. First, we deﬁne a parameter µ, which
describes the probability of “heads” as the parameter of a Bernoulli distri-
bution (Chapter 6); second, we can sample an outcome x ∈{head, tail}
from the Bernoulli distribution p(x | µ) = Ber(µ). The parameter µ gives
rise to a speciﬁc dataset X and depends on the coin used. Since µ is un-
known in advance and can never be observed directly, we need mecha-
nisms to learn something about µ given observed outcomes of coin-ﬂip
experiments. In the following, we will discuss how probabilistic modeling
can be used for this purpose.
8.4.1 Probabilistic Models
A probabilistic
model is speciﬁed
by the joint
distribution of all
random variables.
Probabilistic models represent the uncertain aspects of an experiment as
probability distributions. The beneﬁt of using probabilistic models is that
they offer a uniﬁed and consistent set of tools from probability theory
(Chapter 6) for modeling, inference, prediction, and model selection.
In probabilistic modeling, the joint distribution p(x, θ) of the observed
variables x and the hidden parameters θ is of central importance: It en-
capsulates information from the following:
The prior and the likelihood (product rule, Section 6.3).
The marginal likelihood p(x), which will play an important role in
model selection (Section 8.6), can be computed by taking the joint dis-
tribution and integrating out the parameters (sum rule, Section 6.3).
The posterior, which can be obtained by dividing the joint by the marginal
likelihood.
Only the joint distribution has this property. Therefore, a probabilistic
model is speciﬁed by the joint distribution of all its random variables.
8.4.2 Bayesian Inference
Parameter
estimation can be
phrased as an
optimization
problem.
A key task in machine learning is to take a model and the data to uncover
the values of the model’s hidden variables θ given the observed variables
x. In Section 8.3.1, we already discussed two ways for estimating model
parameters θ using maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori esti-
mation. In both cases, we obtain a single-best value for θ so that the key
algorithmic problem of parameter estimation is solving an optimization
problem. Once these point estimates θ∗are known, we use them to make
predictions. More speciﬁcally, the predictive distribution will be p(x | θ∗),
where we use θ∗in the likelihood function.
As discussed in Section 6.3, focusing solely on some statistic of the pos-
terior distribution (such as the parameter θ∗that maximizes the poste-
rior) leads to loss of information, which can be critical in a system that

X (given by the likelihood) to obtain the posterior distribution p(θ | X).
The implication of having a posterior distribution on the parameters is
that it can be used to propagate uncertainty from the parameters to the
data. More speciﬁcally, with a distribution p(θ) on the parameters our
predictions will be
p(x) =
Z
p(x | θ)p(θ)dθ = Eθ[p(x | θ)] ,
(8.23)
and they no longer depend on the model parameters θ, which have been
marginalized/integrated out. Equation (8.23) reveals that the prediction
is an average over all plausible parameter values θ, where the plausibility
is encapsulated by the parameter distribution p(θ).
Having discussed parameter estimation in Section 8.3 and Bayesian in-
ference here, let us compare these two approaches to learning. Parameter
estimation via maximum likelihood or MAP estimation yields a consistent
point estimate θ∗of the parameters, and the key computational problem
to be solved is optimization. In contrast, Bayesian inference yields a (pos-
terior) distribution, and the key computational problem to be solved is
integration. Predictions with point estimates are straightforward, whereas
predictions in the Bayesian framework require solving another integration
problem; see (8.23). However, Bayesian inference gives us a principled
way to incorporate prior knowledge, account for side information, and
incorporate structural knowledge, all of which is not easily done in the
context of parameter estimation. Moreover, the propagation of parameter
uncertainty to the prediction can be valuable in decision-making systems
for risk assessment and exploration in the context of data-efﬁcient learn-
ing (Deisenroth et al., 2015; Kamthe and Deisenroth, 2018).
While Bayesian inference is a mathematically principled framework for
learning about parameters and making predictions, there are some prac-
tical challenges that come with it because of the integration problems we
need to solve; see (8.22) and (8.23). More speciﬁcally, if we do not choose
a conjugate prior on the parameters (Section 6.6.1), the integrals in (8.22)
and (8.23) are not analytically tractable, and we cannot compute the pos-

terior, the predictions, or the marginal likelihood in closed form. In these
cases, we need to resort to approximations. Here, we can use stochas-
tic approximations, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Gilks
et al., 1996), or deterministic approximations, such as the Laplace ap-
proximation (Bishop, 2006; Barber, 2012; Murphy, 2012), variational in-
ference (Jordan et al., 1999; Blei et al., 2017), or expectation propaga-
tion (Minka, 2001a).
Despite these challenges, Bayesian inference has been successfully ap-
plied to a variety of problems, including large-scale topic modeling (Hoff-
man et al., 2013), click-through-rate prediction (Graepel et al., 2010),
data-efﬁcient reinforcement learning in control systems (Deisenroth et al.,
2015), online ranking systems (Herbrich et al., 2007), and large-scale rec-
ommender systems. There are generic tools, such as Bayesian optimiza-
tion (Brochu et al., 2009; Snoek et al., 2012; Shahriari et al., 2016), that
are very useful ingredients for an efﬁcient search of meta parameters of
models or algorithms.
Remark. In the machine learning literature, there can be a somewhat ar-
bitrary separation between (random) “variables” and “parameters”. While
parameters are estimated (e.g., via maximum likelihood), variables are
usually marginalized out. In this book, we are not so strict with this sep-
aration because, in principle, we can place a prior on any parameter and
integrate it out, which would then turn the parameter into a random vari-
able according to the aforementioned separation.

8.4.3 Latent-Variable Models
In practice, it is sometimes useful to have additional latent variables z
latent variable
(besides the model parameters θ) as part of the model (Moustaki et al.,
2015). These latent variables are different from the model parameters
θ as they do not parametrize the model explicitly. Latent variables may
describe the data-generating process, thereby contributing to the inter-
pretability of the model. They also often simplify the structure of the
model and allow us to deﬁne simpler and richer model structures. Sim-
pliﬁcation of the model structure often goes hand in hand with a smaller
number of model parameters (Paquet, 2008; Murphy, 2012). Learning in
latent-variable models (at least via maximum likelihood) can be done in a
principled way using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm (Demp-
ster et al., 1977; Bishop, 2006). Examples, where such latent variables
are helpful, are principal component analysis for dimensionality reduc-
tion (Chapter 10), Gaussian mixture models for density estimation (Chap-
ter 11), hidden Markov models (Maybeck, 1979) or dynamical systems
(Ghahramani and Roweis, 1999; Ljung, 1999) for time-series modeling,
and meta learning and task generalization (Hausman et al., 2018; Sæ-
mundsson et al., 2018). Although the introduction of these latent variables

When Models Meet Data
may make the model structure and the generative process easier, learning
in latent-variable models is generally hard, as we will see in Chapter 11.
Since latent-variable models also allow us to deﬁne the process that
generates data from parameters, let us have a look at this generative pro-
cess. Denoting data by x, the model parameters by θ and the latent vari-
ables by z, we obtain the conditional distribution
p(x | z, θ)
(8.24)
that allows us to generate data for any model parameters and latent vari-
ables. Given that z are latent variables, we place a prior p(z) on them.
As the models we discussed previously, models with latent variables
can be used for parameter learning and inference within the frameworks
we discussed in Sections 8.3 and 8.4.2. To facilitate learning (e.g., by
means of maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian inference), we fol-
low a two-step procedure. First, we compute the likelihood p(x | θ) of the
model, which does not depend on the latent variables. Second, we use this
likelihood for parameter estimation or Bayesian inference, where we use
exactly the same expressions as in Sections 8.3 and 8.4.2, respectively.
Since the likelihood function p(x | θ) is the predictive distribution of the
data given the model parameters, we need to marginalize out the latent
variables so that
p(x | θ) =
Z
p(x | z, θ)p(z)dz ,
(8.25)
where p(x | z, θ) is given in (8.24) and p(z) is the prior on the latent
variables. Note that the likelihood must not depend on the latent variables

z, but it is only a function of the data x and the model parameters θ.
The likelihood in (8.25) directly allows for parameter estimation via
maximum likelihood. MAP estimation is also straightforward with an ad-
ditional prior on the model parameters θ as discussed in Section 8.3.2.
Moreover, with the likelihood (8.25) Bayesian inference (Section 8.4.2)
in a latent-variable model works in the usual way: We place a prior p(θ)
on the model parameters and use Bayes’ theorem to obtain a posterior
distribution
p(θ | X) = p(X | θ)p(θ)
p(X)
(8.26)
over the model parameters given a dataset X . The posterior in (8.26) can
be used for predictions within a Bayesian inference framework; see (8.23).
One challenge we have in this latent-variable model is that the like-
lihood p(X | θ) requires the marginalization of the latent variables ac-
cording to (8.25). Except when we choose a conjugate prior p(z) for
p(x | z, θ), the marginalization in (8.25) is not analytically tractable, and
we need to resort to approximations (Bishop, 2006; Paquet, 2008; Mur-
phy, 2012; Moustaki et al., 2015).

same time is not possible in general (Bishop, 2006; Murphy, 2012). A
quantity that is easier to compute is the posterior distribution on the latent
variables, but conditioned on the model parameters, i.e.,
p(z | X, θ) = p(X | z, θ)p(z)
p(X | θ)
,
(8.28)
where p(z) is the prior on the latent variables and p(X | z, θ) is given
in (8.24).
In Chapters 10 and 11, we derive the likelihood functions for PCA and
Gaussian mixture models, respectively. Moreover, we compute the poste-
rior distributions (8.28) on the latent variables for both PCA and Gaussian
mixture models.
Remark. In the following chapters, we may not be drawing such a clear
distinction between latent variables z and uncertain model parameters θ
and call the model parameters “latent” or “hidden” as well because they
are unobserved. In Chapters 10 and 11, where we use the latent variables
z, we will pay attention to the difference as we will have two different
types of hidden variables: model parameters θ and latent variables z.

We can exploit the fact that all the elements of a probabilistic model are
random variables to deﬁne a uniﬁed language for representing them. In
Section 8.5, we will see a concise graphical language for representing the
structure of probabilistic models. We will use this graphical language to
describe the probabilistic models in the subsequent chapters.
8.4.4 Further Reading
Probabilistic models in machine learning (Bishop, 2006; Barber, 2012;
Murphy, 2012) provide a way for users to capture uncertainty about data
and predictive models in a principled fashion. Ghahramani (2015) presents
a short review of probabilistic models in machine learning. Given a proba-
bilistic model, we may be lucky enough to be able to compute parameters
of interest analytically. However, in general, analytic solutions are rare,
and computational methods such as sampling (Gilks et al., 1996; Brooks
et al., 2011) and variational inference (Jordan et al., 1999; Blei et al.,

overview of Bayesian inference in latent-variable models.
In recent years, several programming languages have been proposed
that aim to treat the variables deﬁned in software as random variables
corresponding to probability distributions. The objective is to be able to
write complex functions of probability distributions, while under the hood
the compiler automatically takes care of the rules of Bayesian inference.
This rapidly changing ﬁeld is called probabilistic programming.

8.5 Directed Graphical Models
In this section, we introduce a graphical language for specifying a prob-
abilistic model, called the directed graphical model. It provides a compact
directed graphical
model
and succinct way to specify probabilistic models, and allows the reader to
visually parse dependencies between random variables. A graphical model
visually captures the way in which the joint distribution over all random
variables can be decomposed into a product of factors depending only on
a subset of these variables. In Section 8.4, we identiﬁed the joint distri-
bution of a probabilistic model as the key quantity of interest because it
comprises information about the prior, the likelihood, and the posterior.
However, the joint distribution by itself can be quite complicated, and
Directed graphical
models are also
known as Bayesian
networks.
it does not tell us anything about structural properties of the probabilis-
tic model. For example, the joint distribution p(a, b, c) does not tell us
anything about independence relations. This is the point where graphical
models come into play. This section relies on the concepts of independence
and conditional independence, as described in Section 6.4.5.
In a graphical model, nodes are random variables. In Figure 8.9(a), the
graphical model
nodes represent the random variables a, b, c. Edges represent probabilistic
relations between variables, e.g., conditional probabilities.
Remark. Not every distribution can be represented in a particular choice of
graphical model. A discussion of this can be found in Bishop (2006).
♦
Probabilistic graphical models have some convenient properties:
They are a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model.
They can be used to design or motivate new kinds of statistical models.
Inspection of the graph alone gives us insight into properties, e.g., con-
ditional independence.
Complex computations for inference and learning in statistical models
can be expressed in terms of graphical manipulations.

also entails computational simpliﬁcation. Directed links (arrows) between
two nodes (random variables) indicate conditional probabilities. For ex-
ample, the arrow between a and b in Figure 8.9(a) gives the conditional
probability p(b | a) of b given a.

Directed graphical models can be derived from joint distributions if we
know something about their factorization.
Example 8.7
Consider the joint distribution
p(a, b, c) = p(c | a, b)p(b | a)p(a)
(8.29)
of three random variables a, b, c. The factorization of the joint distribution
in (8.29) tells us something about the relationship between the random
variables:
c depends directly on a and b.
b depends directly on a.
a depends neither on b nor on c.
For the factorization in (8.29), we obtain the directed graphical model in
Figure 8.9(a).
In general, we can construct the corresponding directed graphical model
from a factorized joint distribution as follows:
1. Create a node for all random variables.
2. For each conditional distribution, we add a directed link (arrow) to
the graph from the nodes corresponding to the variables on which the
distribution is conditioned.
The graph layout
depends on the
factorization of the
joint distribution.
The graph layout depends on the choice of factorization of the joint dis-
tribution.
We discussed how to get from a known factorization of the joint dis-
tribution to the corresponding directed graphical model. Now, we will do

exactly the opposite and describe how to extract the joint distribution of
a set of random variables from a given graphical model.
Example 8.8
Looking at the graphical model in Figure 8.9(b), we exploit two proper-
ties:
The joint distribution p(x1, . . . , x5) we seek is the product of a set of
conditionals, one for each node in the graph. In this particular example,
we will need ﬁve conditionals.
Each conditional depends only on the parents of the corresponding
node in the graph. For example, x4 will be conditioned on x2.
These two properties yield the desired factorization of the joint distribu-
tion
p(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) = p(x1)p(x5)p(x2 | x5)p(x3 | x1, x2)p(x4 | x2) . (8.30)
In general, the joint distribution p(x) = p(x1, . . . , xK) is given as
p(x) =
K
Y
k=1
p(xk | Pak) ,
(8.31)
where Pak means “the parent nodes of xk”. Parent nodes of xk are nodes
that have arrows pointing to xk.
We conclude this subsection with a concrete example of the coin-ﬂip
experiment. Consider a Bernoulli experiment (Example 6.8) where the
probability that the outcome x of this experiment is “heads” is
p(x | µ) = Ber(µ) .
(8.32)
We now repeat this experiment N times and observe outcomes x1, . . . , xN
so that we obtain the joint distribution
p(x1, . . . , xN | µ) =
N
Y
n=1
p(xn | µ) .
(8.33)
The expression on the right-hand side is a product of Bernoulli distribu-
tions on each individual outcome because the experiments are indepen-
dent. Recall from Section 6.4.5 that statistical independence means that
the distribution factorizes. To write the graphical model down for this set-
ting, we make the distinction between unobserved/latent variables and
observed variables. Graphically, observed variables are denoted by shaded
nodes so that we obtain the graphical model in Figure 8.10(a). We see
that the single parameter µ is the same for all xn, n = 1, . . . , N as the
outcomes xn are identically distributed. A more compact, but equivalent,
graphical model for this setting is given in Figure 8.10(b), where we use

alent, but the plate notation is more compact. Graphical models immedi-
ately allow us to place a hyperprior on µ. A hyperprior is a second layer

of prior distributions on the parameters of the ﬁrst layer of priors. Fig-
ure 8.10(c) places a Beta(α, β) prior on the latent variable µ. If we treat
α and β as deterministic parameters, i.e., not random variables, we omit
the circle around it.
8.5.2 Conditional Independence and d-Separation
Directed graphical models allow us to ﬁnd conditional independence (Sec-
tion 6.4.5) relationship properties of the joint distribution only by looking
at the graph. A concept called d-separation (Pearl, 1988) is key to this.
d-separation
Consider a general directed graph in which A, B, C are arbitrary nonin-
tersecting sets of nodes (whose union may be smaller than the complete
set of nodes in the graph). We wish to ascertain whether a particular con-
ditional independence statement, “A is conditionally independent of B
given C”, denoted by
A ⊥⊥B | C ,
(8.34)
is implied by a given directed acyclic graph. To do so, we consider all
possible trails (paths that ignore the direction of the arrows) from any
node in A to any nodes in B. Any such path is said to be blocked if it
includes any node such that either of the following are true:
The arrows on the path meet either head to tail or tail to tail at the
node, and the node is in the set C.
The arrows meet head to head at the node, and neither the node nor
any of its descendants is in the set C.
If all paths are blocked, then A is said to be d-separated from B by C,
and the joint distribution over all of the variables in the graph will satisfy
A ⊥⊥B | C.

Directed graphical models allow a compact representation of proba-
bilistic models, and we will see examples of directed graphical models in
Chapters 9, 10, and 11. The representation, along with the concept of con-
ditional independence, allows us to factorize the respective probabilistic
models into expressions that are easier to optimize.
The graphical representation of the probabilistic model allows us to
visually see the impact of design choices we have made on the structure
of the model. We often need to make high-level assumptions about the
structure of the model. These modeling assumptions (hyperparameters)
affect the prediction performance, but cannot be selected directly using
the approaches we have seen so far. We will discuss different ways to
choose the structure in Section 8.6.

8.5.3 Further Reading
An introduction to probabilistic graphical models can be found in Bishop
(2006, chapter 8), and an extensive description of the different applica-
tions and corresponding algorithmic implications can be found in the book
by Koller and Friedman (2009). There are three main types of probabilistic
graphical models:

Graphical models allow for graph-based algorithms for inference and
learning, e.g., via local message passing. Applications range from rank-
ing in online games (Herbrich et al., 2007) and computer vision (e.g.,
image segmentation, semantic labeling, image denoising, image restora-
tion (Kittler and F¨oglein, 1984; Sucar and Gillies, 1994; Shotton et al.,
2006; Szeliski et al., 2008)) to coding theory (McEliece et al., 1998), solv-
ing linear equation systems (Shental et al., 2008), and iterative Bayesian
state estimation in signal processing (Bickson et al., 2007; Deisenroth and
Mohamed, 2012).
One topic that is particularly important in real applications that we do
not discuss in this book is the idea of structured prediction (Bakir et al.,
2007; Nowozin et al., 2014), which allows machine learning models to
tackle predictions that are structured, for example sequences, trees, and
graphs. The popularity of neural network models has allowed more ﬂex-
ible probabilistic models to be used, resulting in many useful applica-
tions of structured models (Goodfellow et al., 2016, chapter 16). In recent
years, there has been a renewed interest in graphical models due to their
applications to causal inference (Pearl, 2009; Imbens and Rubin, 2015;
Peters et al., 2017; Rosenbaum, 2017).
8.6 Model Selection
In machine learning, we often need to make high-level modeling decisions
that critically inﬂuence the performance of the model. The choices we
make (e.g., the functional form of the likelihood) inﬂuence the number
and type of free parameters in the model and thereby also the ﬂexibility
and expressivity of the model. More complex models are more ﬂexible in

the sense that they can be used to describe more datasets. For instance, a
polynomial of degree 1 (a line y = a0 + a1x) can only be used to describe
linear relations between inputs x and observations y. A polynomial of
degree 2 can additionally describe quadratic relationships between inputs
and observations.
One would now think that very ﬂexible models are generally preferable
to simple models because they are more expressive. A general problem

is that at training time we can only use the training set to evaluate the
performance of the model and learn its parameters. However, the per-
formance on the training set is not really what we are interested in. In
Section 8.3, we have seen that maximum likelihood estimation can lead
to overﬁtting, especially when the training dataset is small. Ideally, our
model (also) works well on the test set (which is not available at training
time). Therefore, we need some mechanisms for assessing how a model
generalizes to unseen test data. Model selection is concerned with exactly
this problem.
8.6.1 Nested Cross-Validation
We have already seen an approach (cross-validation in Section 8.2.4) that
can be used for model selection. Recall that cross-validation provides an
estimate of the generalization error by repeatedly splitting the dataset into
training and validation sets. We can apply this idea one more time, i.e.,
for each split, we can perform another round of cross-validation. This is
sometimes referred to as nested cross-validation; see Figure 8.13. The inner
nested
cross-validation
level is used to estimate the performance of a particular choice of model
or hyperparameter on a internal validation set. The outer level is used to
estimate generalization performance for the best choice of model chosen
by the inner loop. We can test different model and hyperparameter choices
in the inner loop. To distinguish the two levels, the set used to estimate
the generalization performance is often called the test set and the set used
test set
for choosing the best model is called the validation set. The inner loop
validation set
estimates the expected value of the generalization error for a given model
(8.39), by approximating it using the empirical error on the validation set,
i.e.,

where R(V | M) is the empirical risk (e.g., root mean square error) on the

choose the model that performs best. Note that cross-validation not only
gives us the expected generalization error, but we can also obtain high-
order statistics, e.g., the standard error, an estimate of how uncertain the

8.6.2 Bayesian Model Selection
There are many approaches to model selection, some of which are covered
in this section. Generally, they all attempt to trade off model complexity
and data ﬁt. We assume that simpler models are less prone to overﬁtting
than complex models, and hence the objective of model selection is to ﬁnd
the simplest model that explains the data reasonably well. This concept is
also known as Occam’s razor.
Occam’s razor
Remark. If we treat model selection as a hypothesis testing problem, we
are looking for the simplest hypothesis that is consistent with the data (Mur-
phy, 2012).
♦
One may consider placing a prior on models that favors simpler models.
However, it is not necessary to do this: An “automatic Occam’s Razor” is
quantitatively embodied in the application of Bayesian probability (Smith
and Spiegelhalter, 1980; Jefferys and Berger, 1992; MacKay, 1992). Fig-
ure 8.14, adapted from MacKay (2003), gives us the basic intuition why
complex and very expressive models may turn out to be a less probable
choice for modeling a given dataset D. Let us think of the horizontal axis

representing the space of all possible datasets D. If we are interested in
the posterior probability p(Mi | D) of model Mi given the data D, we can
employ Bayes’ theorem. Assuming a uniform prior p(M) over all mod-
els, Bayes’ theorem rewards models in proportion to how much they pre-
dicted the data that occurred. This prediction of the data given model
Mi, p(D | Mi), is called the evidence for Mi. A simple model M1 can only

When Models Meet Data
to predict a greater variety of datasets. This means, however, that M2
does not predict the datasets in region C as well as M1. Suppose that
equal prior probabilities have been assigned to the two models. Then, if
the dataset falls into region C, the less powerful model M1 is the more
probable model.
Earlier in this chapter, we argued that models need to be able to explain
the data, i.e., there should be a way to generate data from a given model.
Furthermore, if the model has been appropriately learned from the data,
then we expect that the generated data should be similar to the empirical
data. For this, it is helpful to phrase model selection as a hierarchical
inference problem, which allows us to compute the posterior distribution
over models.
Let us consider a ﬁnite number of models M = {M1, . . . , MK}, where
each model Mk possesses parameters θk. In Bayesian model selection, we

place a prior p(M) on the set of models. The corresponding generative

theorem and compute the posterior distribution over models as
p(Mk | D) ∝p(Mk)p(D | Mk) .
(8.43)
Note that this posterior no longer depends on the model parameters θk
because they have been integrated out in the Bayesian setting since
p(D | Mk) =
Z
p(D | θk)p(θk | Mk)dθk ,
(8.44)
where p(θk | Mk) is the prior distribution of the model parameters θk of
model Mk. The term (8.44) is referred to as the model evidence or marginal

(8.45)
With a uniform prior p(Mk) =

K , which gives every model equal (prior)
probability, determining the MAP estimate over models amounts to pick-
ing the model that maximizes the model evidence (8.44).
Remark (Likelihood and Marginal Likelihood). There are some important
differences between a likelihood and a marginal likelihood (evidence):
While the likelihood is prone to overﬁtting, the marginal likelihood is typ-
ically not as the model parameters have been marginalized out (i.e., we
no longer have to ﬁt the parameters). Furthermore, the marginal likeli-
hood automatically embodies a trade-off between model complexity and
data ﬁt (Occam’s razor).

8.6.3 Bayes Factors for Model Comparison
Consider the problem of comparing two probabilistic models M1, M2,
given a dataset D. If we compute the posteriors p(M1 | D) and p(M2 | D),
we can compute the ratio of the posteriors
p(M1 | D)

.
(8.46)
The ratio of the posteriors is also called the posterior odds. The ﬁrst frac-
posterior odds
tion on the right-hand side of (8.46), the prior odds, measures how much
prior odds
our prior (initial) beliefs favor M1 over M2. The ratio of the marginal like-
lihoods (second fraction on the right-hand-side) is called the Bayes factor
Bayes factor
and measures how well the data D is predicted by M1 compared to M2.
Remark. The Jeffreys-Lindley paradox states that the “Bayes factor always
Jeffreys-Lindley
paradox
favors the simpler model since the probability of the data under a complex
model with a diffuse prior will be very small” (Murphy, 2012). Here, a
diffuse prior refers to a prior that does not favor speciﬁc models, i.e.,
many models are a priori plausible under this prior.
♦
If we choose a uniform prior over models, the prior odds term in (8.46)
is 1, i.e., the posterior odds is the ratio of the marginal likelihoods (Bayes
factor)
p(D | M1)
p(D | M2) .
(8.47)
If the Bayes factor is greater than 1, we choose model M1, otherwise
model M2. In a similar way to frequentist statistics, there are guidelines
on the size of the ratio that one should consider before ”signiﬁcance” of
the result (Jeffreys, 1961).
Remark (Computing the Marginal Likelihood). The marginal likelihood
plays an important role in model selection: We need to compute Bayes
factors (8.46) and posterior distributions over models (8.43).
Unfortunately, computing the marginal likelihood requires us to solve
an integral (8.44). This integration is generally analytically intractable,
and we will have to resort to approximation techniques, e.g., numerical
integration (Stoer and Burlirsch, 2002), stochastic approximations using
Monte Carlo (Murphy, 2012), or Bayesian Monte Carlo techniques (O’Hagan,
1991; Rasmussen and Ghahramani, 2003).
However, there are special cases in which we can solve it. In Section 6.6.1,
we discussed conjugate models. If we choose a conjugate parameter prior
p(θ), we can compute the marginal likelihood in closed form. In Chap-
ter 9, we will do exactly this in the context of linear regression.

how the three different ﬂavors of learning in Sections 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4 are
applied to the four pillars of machine learning (regression, dimensionality
reduction, density estimation, and classiﬁcation).
8.6.4 Further Reading
We mentioned at the start of the section that there are high-level modeling
choices that inﬂuence the performance of the model. Examples include the
following:
The degree of a polynomial in a regression setting
The number of components in a mixture model
The network architecture of a (deep) neural network
The type of kernel in a support vector machine
The dimensionality of the latent space in PCA
The learning rate (schedule) in an optimization algorithm
In parametric
models, the number
of parameters is
often related to the
complexity of the
model class.
Rasmussen and Ghahramani (2001) showed that the automatic Occam’s
razor does not necessarily penalize the number of parameters in a model,
but it is active in terms of the complexity of functions. They also showed
that the automatic Occam’s razor also holds for Bayesian nonparametric
models with many parameters, e.g., Gaussian processes.
If we focus on the maximum likelihood estimate, there exist a number of
heuristics for model selection that discourage overﬁtting. They are called
information criteria, and we choose the model with the largest value. The
Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974)

Linear Regression
In the following, we will apply the mathematical concepts from Chap-
ters 2, 5, 6, and 7 to solve linear regression (curve ﬁtting) problems. In
regression, we aim to ﬁnd a function f that maps inputs x ∈RD to corre-
regression
sponding function values f(x) ∈R. We assume we are given a set of train-
ing inputs xn and corresponding noisy observations yn = f(xn)+ϵ, where
ϵ is an i.i.d. random variable that describes measurement/observation
noise and potentially unmodeled processes (which we will not consider
further in this chapter). Throughout this chapter, we assume zero-mean
Gaussian noise. Our task is to ﬁnd a function that not only models the
training data, but generalizes well to predicting function values at input
locations that are not part of the training data (see Chapter 8). An il-
lustration of such a regression problem is given in Figure 9.1. A typical
regression setting is given in Figure 9.1(a): For some input values xn, we
observe (noisy) function values yn = f(xn) + ϵ. The task is to infer the
function f that generated the data and generalizes well to function values
at new input locations. A possible solution is given in Figure 9.1(b), where
we also show three distributions centered at the function values f(x) that
represent the noise in the data.
Regression is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and regres-
sion problems appear in a diverse range of research areas and applica-

and robotics (e.g., reinforcement learning, forward/inverse model learn-
ing), optimization (e.g., line searches, global optimization), and deep-
learning applications (e.g., computer games, speech-to-text translation,
image recognition, automatic video annotation). Regression is also a key
ingredient of classiﬁcation algorithms. Finding a regression function re-
quires solving a variety of problems, including the following:
Choice of the model (type) and the parametrization of the regres-
sion function. Given a dataset, what function classes (e.g., polynomi-

als) are good candidates for modeling the data, and what particular
parametrization (e.g., degree of the polynomial) should we choose?
Model selection, as discussed in Section 8.6, allows us to compare var-
ious models to ﬁnd the simplest model that explains the training data
reasonably well.
Finding good parameters. Having chosen a model of the regression
function, how do we ﬁnd good model parameters? Here, we will need to
look at different loss/objective functions (they determine what a “good”
ﬁt is) and optimization algorithms that allow us to minimize this loss.
Overﬁtting and model selection. Overﬁtting is a problem when the
regression function ﬁts the training data “too well” but does not gen-
eralize to unseen test data. Overﬁtting typically occurs if the underly-
ing model (or its parametrization) is overly ﬂexible and expressive; see
Section 8.6. We will look at the underlying reasons and discuss ways to
mitigate the effect of overﬁtting in the context of linear regression.
Relationship between loss functions and parameter priors. Loss func-
tions (optimization objectives) are often motivated and induced by prob-
abilistic models. We will look at the connection between loss functions
and the underlying prior assumptions that induce these losses.
Uncertainty modeling. In any practical setting, we have access to only
a ﬁnite, potentially large, amount of (training) data for selecting the
model class and the corresponding parameters. Given that this ﬁnite
amount of training data does not cover all possible scenarios, we may
want to describe the remaining parameter uncertainty to obtain a mea-
sure of conﬁdence of the model’s prediction at test time; the smaller the
training set, the more important uncertainty modeling. Consistent mod-
eling of uncertainty equips model predictions with conﬁdence bounds.
In the following, we will be using the mathematical tools from Chap-
ters 3, 5, 6 and 7 to solve linear regression problems. We will discuss
maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to ﬁnd
optimal model parameters. Using these parameter estimates, we will have
a brief look at generalization errors and overﬁtting. Toward the end of
this chapter, we will discuss Bayesian linear regression, which allows us to
reason about model parameters at a higher level, thereby removing some
of the problems encountered in maximum likelihood and MAP estimation.

9.1 Problem Formulation
291
9.1 Problem Formulation
Because of the presence of observation noise, we will adopt a probabilis-
tic approach and explicitly model the noise using a likelihood function.
More speciﬁcally, throughout this chapter, we consider a regression prob-
lem with the likelihood function
p(y | x) = N
 y | f(x), σ2 .
(9.1)
Here, x ∈RD are inputs and y ∈R are noisy function values (targets).
With (9.1), the functional relationship between x and y is given as
y = f(x) + ϵ ,
(9.2)
where ϵ ∼N
 0, σ2
is independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaus-
sian measurement noise with mean 0 and variance σ2. Our objective is
to ﬁnd a function that is close (similar) to the unknown function f that
generated the data and that generalizes well.
In this chapter, we focus on parametric models, i.e., we choose a para-
metrized function and ﬁnd parameters θ that “work well” for modeling the
data. For the time being, we assume that the noise variance σ2 is known
and focus on learning the model parameters θ. In linear regression, we
consider the special case that the parameters θ appear linearly in our
model. An example of linear regression is given by
p(y | x, θ) = N
 y | x⊤θ, σ2
(9.3)
⇐⇒y = x⊤θ + ϵ ,
ϵ ∼N
 0, σ2 ,
(9.4)
where θ ∈RD are the parameters we seek. The class of functions de-
scribed by (9.4) are straight lines that pass through the origin. In (9.4),
we chose a parametrization f(x) = x⊤θ.
A Dirac delta (delta
function) is zero
everywhere except
at a single point,
and its integral is 1.
It can be considered
a Gaussian in the
limit of σ2 →0.
The likelihood in (9.3) is the probability density function of y evalu-
likelihood
ated at x⊤θ. Note that the only source of uncertainty originates from the
observation noise (as x and θ are assumed known in (9.3)). Without ob-
servation noise, the relationship between x and y would be deterministic
and (9.3) would be a Dirac delta.
Example 9.1
For x, θ ∈R the linear regression model in (9.4) describes straight lines
(linear functions), and the parameter θ is the slope of the line. Fig-
ure 9.2(a) shows some example functions for different values of θ.
Linear regression
refers to models that
are linear in the
parameters.
The linear regression model in (9.3)–(9.4) is not only linear in the pa-
rameters, but also linear in the inputs x. Figure 9.2(a) shows examples
of such functions. We will see later that y = φ⊤(x)θ for nonlinear trans-
formations φ is also a linear regression model because “linear regression”

refers to models that are “linear in the parameters”, i.e., models that de-

ture” is a representation φ(x) of the inputs x.
In the following, we will discuss in more detail how to ﬁnd good pa-
rameters θ and how to evaluate whether a parameter set “works well”.
For the time being, we assume that the noise variance σ2 is known.

see (9.3).
In the following, we will discuss how to ﬁnd optimal parameters θ∗∈
RD for the linear regression model (9.4). Once the parameters θ∗are

Remark. The likelihood p(y | x, θ) is not a probability distribution in θ: It
is simply a function of the parameters θ but does not integrate to 1 (i.e.,
it is unnormalized), and may not even be integrable with respect to θ.
However, the likelihood in (9.7) is a normalized probability distribution
in y.
♦
To ﬁnd the desired parameters θML that maximize the likelihood, we
typically perform gradient ascent (or gradient descent on the negative
likelihood). In the case of linear regression we consider here, however,

increasing function,

optimum of log f.
a closed-form solution exists, which makes iterative gradient descent un-
necessary. In practice, instead of maximizing the likelihood directly, we
apply the log-transformation to the likelihood function and minimize the
negative log-likelihood.
Remark (Log-Transformation). Since the likelihood (9.5b) is a product of
N Gaussian distributions, the log-transformation is useful since (a) it does
not suffer from numerical underﬂow, and (b) the differentiation rules will
turn out simpler. More speciﬁcally, numerical underﬂow will be a prob-
lem when we multiply N probabilities, where N is the number of data
points, since we cannot represent very small numbers, such as 10−256.
Furthermore, the log-transform will turn the product into a sum of log-
probabilities such that the corresponding gradient is a sum of individual
gradients, instead of a repeated application of the product rule (5.46) to
compute the gradient of a product of N terms.

the Gaussian additive noise term), such that we arrive at

With (9.10b), we have now a concrete form of the negative log-likelihood

in θ. This means that we can ﬁnd a unique global solution θML for mini-
mizing the negative log-likelihood L. We can ﬁnd the global optimum by
computing the gradient of L, setting it to 0 and solving for θ.
Using the results from Chapter 5, we compute the gradient of L with

Example 9.2 (Fitting Lines)
Let us have a look at Figure 9.2, where we aim to ﬁt a straight line f(x) =
θx, where θ is an unknown slope, to a dataset using maximum likelihood
estimation. Examples of functions in this model class (straight lines) are
shown in Figure 9.2(a). For the dataset shown in Figure 9.2(b), we ﬁnd
the maximum likelihood estimate of the slope parameter θ using (9.12c)
and obtain the maximum likelihood linear function in Figure 9.2(c).
Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Features

comes to ﬁtting more interesting data. Fortunately, linear regression offers
us a way to ﬁt nonlinear functions within the linear regression framework:
Since “linear regression” only refers to “linear in the parameters”, we can
perform an arbitrary nonlinear transformation φ(x) of the inputs x and
then linearly combine the components of this transformation. The corre-
sponding linear regression model is

φk : RD →R is the kth component of the feature vector φ. Note that the

model parameters θ still appear only linearly.
Example 9.3 (Polynomial Regression)
We are concerned with a regression problem y = φ⊤(x)θ+ϵ, where x ∈R
and θ ∈RK. A transformation that is often used in this context is

Comparing (9.18) with the negative log-likelihood in (9.10b) for the “fea-

Estimating the Noise Variance
Thus far, we assumed that the noise variance σ2 is known. However, we
can also use the principle of maximum likelihood estimation to obtain the
maximum likelihood estimator σ2
ML for the noise variance. To do this, we
follow the standard procedure: We write down the log-likelihood, com-
pute its derivative with respect to σ2 > 0, set it to 0, and solve. The
log-likelihood is given by

cations xn.
9.2.2 Overﬁtting in Linear Regression
We just discussed how to use maximum likelihood estimation to ﬁt lin-
ear models (e.g., polynomials) to data. We can evaluate the quality of
the model by computing the error/loss incurred. One way of doing this
is to compute the negative log-likelihood (9.10b), which we minimized
to determine the maximum likelihood estimator. Alternatively, given that
the noise parameter σ2 is not a free model parameter, we can ignore the
scaling by 1/σ2, so that we end up with a squared-error-loss function

For model selection (see Section 8.6), we can use the RMSE (or the
negative log-likelihood) to determine the best degree of the polynomial by
ﬁnding the polynomial degree M that minimizes the objective. Given that
the polynomial degree is a natural number, we can perform a brute-force
search and enumerate all (reasonable) values of M. For a training set of
size N it is sufﬁcient to test 0 ⩽M ⩽N −1. For M < N, the maximum

linear equations (Φ⊤Φ in (9.19) would also no longer be invertible) so
that there are inﬁnitely many possible maximum likelihood estimators.
Figure 9.5 shows a number of polynomial ﬁts determined by maximum
likelihood for the dataset from Figure 9.4(a) with N = 10 observations.
We notice that polynomials of low degree (e.g., constants (M = 0) or
linear (M = 1)) ﬁt the data poorly and, hence, are poor representations
of the true underlying function. For degrees M = 3, . . . , 6, the ﬁts look
plausible and smoothly interpolate the data. When we go to higher-degree

are a poor representation of the underlying function that generated the
data, such that we suffer from overﬁtting.

Remember that the goal is to achieve good generalization by making
accurate predictions for new (unseen) data. We obtain some quantita-
tive insight into the dependence of the generalization performance on the
polynomial of degree M by considering a separate test set comprising 200
data points generated using exactly the same procedure used to generate
the training set. As test inputs, we chose a linear grid of 200 points in the
interval of [−5, 5]. For each choice of M, we evaluate the RMSE (9.23) for
both the training data and the test data.
Looking now at the test error, which is a qualitive measure of the gen-
eralization properties of the corresponding polynomial, we notice that ini-
tially the test error decreases; see Figure 9.6 (orange). For fourth-order
polynomials, the test error is relatively low and stays relatively constant up
to degree 5. However, from degree 6 onward the test error increases signif-
icantly, and high-order polynomials have very bad generalization proper-
ties. In this particular example, this also is evident from the corresponding

9.2.3 Maximum A Posteriori Estimation
We just saw that maximum likelihood estimation is prone to overﬁtting.
We often observe that the magnitude of the parameter values becomes
relatively large if we run into overﬁtting (Bishop, 2006).
To mitigate the effect of huge parameter values, we can place a prior
distribution p(θ) on the parameters. The prior distribution explicitly en-
codes what parameter values are plausible (before having seen any data).
For example, a Gaussian prior p(θ) = N
 0, 1

on a single parameter
θ encodes that parameter values are expected lie in the interval [−2, 2]
(two standard deviations around the mean value). Once a dataset X, Y
is available, instead of maximizing the likelihood we seek parameters that
maximize the posterior distribution p(θ | X, Y). This procedure is called
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation.
maximum a
posteriori
MAP
The posterior over the parameters θ, given the training data X, Y, is
obtained by applying Bayes’ theorem (Section 6.3) as
p(θ | X, Y) = p(Y | X, θ)p(θ)
p(Y | X)
.
(9.24)
Since the posterior explicitly depends on the parameter prior p(θ), the
prior will have an effect on the parameter vector we ﬁnd as the maximizer
of the posterior. We will see this more explicitly in the following. The
parameter vector θMAP that maximizes the posterior (9.24) is the MAP
estimate.
To ﬁnd the MAP estimate, we follow steps that are similar in ﬂavor
to maximum likelihood estimation. We start with the log-transform and
compute the log-posterior as
log p(θ | X, Y) = log p(Y | X, θ) + log p(θ) + const ,
(9.25)

9.2 Parameter Estimation

where the constant comprises the terms that are independent of θ. We see
that the log-posterior in (9.25) is the sum of the log-likelihood p(Y | X, θ)
and the log-prior log p(θ) so that the MAP estimate will be a “compromise”
between the prior (our suggestion for plausible parameter values before
observing data) and the data-dependent likelihood.
To ﬁnd the MAP estimate θMAP, we minimize the negative log-posterior
distribution with respect to θ, i.e., we solve
θMAP ∈arg min
θ {−log p(Y | X, θ) −log p(θ)} .
(9.26)

estimates according to (9.31). In Figure 9.7, we show both the maximum
likelihood and the MAP estimates for polynomials of degree 6 (left) and
degree 8 (right). The prior (regularizer) does not play a signiﬁcant role
for the low-degree polynomial, but keeps the function relatively smooth
for higher-degree polynomials. Although the MAP estimate can push the
boundaries of overﬁtting, it is not a general solution to this problem, so
we need a more principled approach to tackle overﬁtting.

9.2.4 MAP Estimation as Regularization
Instead of placing a prior distribution on the parameters θ, it is also pos-
sible to mitigate the effect of overﬁtting by penalizing the amplitude of
the parameter by means of regularization. In regularized least squares, we

Given that the regularized least-squares loss function in (9.32) consists
of terms that are closely related to the negative log-likelihood plus a neg-
ative log-prior, it is not surprising that, when we minimize this loss, we
obtain a solution that closely resembles the MAP estimate in (9.31). More
speciﬁcally, minimizing the regularized least-squares loss function yields
θRLS = (Φ⊤Φ + λI)−1Φ⊤y ,
(9.34)

So far, we have covered parameter estimation using maximum likeli-
hood and MAP estimation where we found point estimates θ∗that op-
timize an objective function (likelihood or posterior). We saw that both
maximum likelihood and MAP estimation can lead to overﬁtting. In the
next section, we will discuss Bayesian linear regression, where we use
Bayesian inference (Section 8.4) to ﬁnd a posterior distribution over the
unknown parameters, which we subsequently use to make predictions.
More speciﬁcally, for predictions we will average over all plausible sets of
parameters instead of focusing on a point estimate.
9.3 Bayesian Linear Regression
Previously, we looked at linear regression models where we estimated the
model parameters θ, e.g., by means of maximum likelihood or MAP esti-
mation. We discovered that MLE can lead to severe overﬁtting, in particu-
lar, in the small-data regime. MAP addresses this issue by placing a prior
on the parameters that plays the role of a regularizer.
Bayesian linear
regression
Bayesian linear regression pushes the idea of the parameter prior a step
further and does not even attempt to compute a point estimate of the
parameters, but instead the full posterior distribution over the parameters
is taken into account when making predictions. This means we do not ﬁt
any parameters, but we compute a mean over all plausible parameters
settings (according to the posterior).

bilistic model, i.e., the joint distribution of observed and unobserved ran-
dom variables, y and θ, respectively, is
p(y, θ | x) = p(y | x, θ)p(θ) .
(9.36)
9.3.2 Prior Predictions
In practice, we are usually not so much interested in the parameter values
θ themselves. Instead, our focus often lies in the predictions we make
with those parameter values. In a Bayesian setting, we take the parameter
distribution and average over all plausible parameter settings when we
make predictions. More speciﬁcally, to make predictions at an input x∗,
we integrate out θ and obtain
p(y∗| x∗) =
Z
p(y∗| x∗, θ)p(θ)dθ = Eθ[p(y∗| x∗, θ)] ,
(9.37)
which we can interpret as the average prediction of y∗| x∗, θ for all plau-
sible parameters θ according to the prior distribution p(θ). Note that pre-
dictions using the prior distribution only require us to specify the input
x∗, but no training data.
In our model (9.35), we chose a conjugate (Gaussian) prior on θ so
that the predictive distribution is Gaussian as well (and can be computed
in closed form): With the prior distribution p(θ) = N
 m0, S0

, we obtain
the predictive distribution as
p(y∗| x∗) = N
 φ⊤(x∗)m0, φ⊤(x∗)S0φ(x∗) + σ2 ,
(9.38)
where we exploited that (i) the prediction is Gaussian due to conjugacy
(see Section 6.6) and the marginalization property of Gaussians (see Sec-
tion 6.5), (ii) the Gaussian noise is independent so that
V[y∗] = Vθ[φ⊤(x∗)θ] + Vϵ[ϵ] ,
(9.39)
and (iii) y∗is a linear transformation of θ so that we can apply the rules
for computing the mean and covariance of the prediction analytically by
using (6.50) and (6.51), respectively. In (9.38), the term φ⊤(x∗)S0φ(x∗)
in the predictive variance explicitly accounts for the uncertainty associated

the measurement noise.

ing data X, Y), the same principles for prediction and inference hold
as in (9.37) – we just need to replace the prior p(θ) with the posterior

using Bayes’ theorem as
p(θ | X, Y) = p(Y | X, θ)p(θ)
p(Y | X)
,
(9.41)
where X is the set of training inputs and Y the collection of correspond-
ing training targets. Furthermore, p(Y | X, θ) is the likelihood, p(θ) the
parameter prior, and

can think of the marginal likelihood as the likelihood averaged over all
possible parameter settings (with respect to the prior distribution p(θ)).

tional to the product of the likelihood p(Y | X, θ) and the prior p(θ):

Since A, a can be difﬁcult to identify in equations like (9.46a), it is of-
ten helpful to bring these equations into the form (9.51) that decouples
quadratic term, linear terms, and constants, which simpliﬁes ﬁnding the
desired solution.
9.3.4 Posterior Predictions
In (9.37), we computed the predictive distribution of y∗at a test input
x∗using the parameter prior p(θ). In principle, predicting with the pa-
rameter posterior p(θ | X, Y) is not fundamentally different given that
in our conjugate model the prior and posterior are both Gaussian (with
different parameters). Therefore, by following the same reasoning as in
Section 9.3.2, we obtain the (posterior) predictive distribution

the predictions made with the MAP estimate θMAP.

Remark (Marginal Likelihood and Posterior Predictive Distribution). By
replacing the integral in (9.57a), the predictive distribution can be equiv-
alently written as the expectation Eθ | X,Y[p(y∗| x∗, θ)], where the expec-
tation is taken with respect to the parameter posterior p(θ | X, Y).
Writing the posterior predictive distribution in this way highlights a
close resemblance to the marginal likelihood (9.42). The key difference
between the marginal likelihood and the posterior predictive distribution
are (i) the marginal likelihood can be thought of predicting the training
targets y and not the test targets y∗, and (ii) the marginal likelihood av-
erages with respect to the parameter prior and not the parameter poste-
rior.
♦
Remark (Mean and Variance of Noise-Free Function Values). In many
cases, we are not interested in the predictive distribution p(y∗| X, Y, x∗)
of a (noisy) observation y∗. Instead, we would like to obtain the distribu-
tion of the (noise-free) function values f(x∗) = φ⊤(x∗)θ. We determine
the corresponding moments by exploiting the properties of means and
variances, which yields
E[f(x∗) | X, Y] = Eθ[φ⊤(x∗)θ | X, Y] = φ⊤(x∗)Eθ[θ | X, Y]
= φ⊤(x∗)mN = m⊤
Nφ(x∗) ,
(9.58)
Vθ[f(x∗) | X, Y] = Vθ[φ⊤(x∗)θ | X, Y]
= φ⊤(x∗)Vθ[θ | X, Y]φ(x∗)
= φ⊤(x∗)SNφ(x∗) .
(9.59)
We see that the predictive mean is the same as the predictive mean for
noisy observations as the noise has mean 0, and the predictive variance
only differs by σ2, which is the variance of the measurement noise: When
we predict noisy function values, we need to include σ2 as a source of
uncertainty, but this term is not needed for noise-free predictions. Here,
the only remaining uncertainty stems from the parameter posterior.

Integrating out

Remark (Distribution over Functions). The fact that we integrate out the
parameters θ induces a distribution over functions: If we sample θi ∼
p(θ | X, Y) from the parameter posterior, we obtain a single function re-
alization θ⊤
i φ(·). The mean function, i.e., the set of all expected function

values Eθ[f(·) | θ, X, Y], of this distribution over functions is m⊤

The (marginal) variance, i.e., the variance of the function f(·), is given by

we sampled parameters θi from the parameter posterior and computed
the function φ⊤(x∗)θi, which is a single realization of a function under
the posterior distribution over functions. For low-order polynomials, the
parameter posterior does not allow the parameters to vary much: The
sampled functions are nearly identical. When we make the model more
ﬂexible by adding more parameters (i.e., we end up with a higher-order
polynomial), these parameters are not sufﬁciently constrained by the pos-
terior, and the sampled functions can be easily visually separated. We also
see in the corresponding panels on the left how the uncertainty increases,
especially at the boundaries.
Although for a seventh-order polynomial the MAP estimate yields a rea-
sonable ﬁt, the Bayesian linear regression model additionally tells us that

Linear Regression
9.3.5 Computing the Marginal Likelihood
In Section 8.6.2, we highlighted the importance of the marginal likelihood
for Bayesian model selection. In the following, we compute the marginal
likelihood for Bayesian linear regression with a conjugate Gaussian prior
on the parameters, i.e., exactly the setting we have been discussing in this
chapter.
Just to recap, we consider the following generative process:
θ ∼N
 m0, S0

(9.60a)
yn | xn, θ ∼N
 x⊤
n θ, σ2 ,
(9.60b)
n = 1, . . . , N. The marginal likelihood is given by
The marginal
likelihood can be
interpreted as the
expected likelihood
under the prior, i.e.,
Eθ[p(Y | X, θ)].

(9.61a)
=
Z
N
 y | Xθ, σ2I
N
 θ | m0, S0
dθ ,
(9.61b)
where we integrate out the model parameters θ. We compute the marginal
likelihood in two steps: First, we show that the marginal likelihood is
Gaussian (as a distribution in y); second, we compute the mean and co-
variance of this Gaussian.
1. The marginal likelihood is Gaussian: From Section 6.5.2, we know that
(i) the product of two Gaussian random variables is an (unnormalized)
Gaussian distribution, and (ii) a linear transformation of a Gaussian
random variable is Gaussian distributed. In (9.61b), we require a linear
transformation to bring N
 y | Xθ, σ2I

into the form N
 θ | µ, Σ

for
some µ, Σ. Once this is done, the integral can be solved in closed form.
The result is the normalizing constant of the product of the two Gaus-
sians. The normalizing constant itself has Gaussian shape; see (6.76).
2. Mean and covariance. We compute the mean and covariance matrix
of the marginal likelihood by exploiting the standard results for means
and covariances of afﬁne transformations of random variables; see Sec-
tion 6.4.4. The mean of the marginal likelihood is computed as
E[Y | X] = Eθ,ϵ[Xθ + ϵ] = XEθ[θ] = Xm0 .
(9.62)
Note that ϵ ∼N
 0, σ2I

is a vector of i.i.d. random variables. The
covariance matrix is given as
Cov[Y|X] = Covθ,ϵ[Xθ + ϵ] = Covθ[Xθ] + σ2I
(9.63a)
= X Covθ[θ]X⊤+ σ2I = XS0X⊤+ σ2I .
(9.63b)
Hence, the marginal likelihood is

(9.64b)
Given the close connection with the posterior predictive distribution (see
Remark on Marginal Likelihood and Posterior Predictive Distribution ear-
lier in this section), the functional form of the marginal likelihood should
not be too surprising.
9.4 Maximum Likelihood as Orthogonal Projection
Having crunched through much algebra to derive maximum likelihood
and MAP estimates, we will now provide a geometric interpretation of
maximum likelihood estimation. Let us consider a simple linear regression
setting
y = xθ + ϵ,
ϵ ∼N
 0, σ2 ,
(9.65)
in which we consider linear functions f : R →R that go through the
origin (we omit features here for clarity). The parameter θ determines the
slope of the line. Figure 9.12(a) shows a one-dimensional dataset.
With a training data set {(x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN)} we recall the results
from Section 9.2.1 and obtain the maximum likelihood estimator for the
slope parameter as
θML = (X⊤X)−1X⊤y = X⊤y
X⊤X ∈R ,
(9.66)
where X = [x1, . . . , xN]⊤∈RN, y = [y1, . . . , yN]⊤∈RN.
This means for the training inputs X we obtain the optimal (maximum
likelihood) reconstruction of the training targets as
XθML = X X⊤y
X⊤X = XX⊤
X⊤X y ,

i.e., we obtain the approximation with the minimum least-squares error

fore, we can relate to concepts from linear algebra and analytic geometry
that we discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. In particular, looking carefully
at (9.67) we see that the maximum likelihood estimator θML in our ex-
ample from (9.65) effectively does an orthogonal projection of y onto
the one-dimensional subspace spanned by X. Recalling the results on or-

thogonal projections from Section 3.8, we identify XX⊤
X⊤X as the projection
matrix, θML as the coordinates of the projection onto the one-dimensional
subspace of RN spanned by X and XθML as the orthogonal projection of
y onto this subspace.
Therefore, the maximum likelihood solution provides also a geometri-
cally optimal solution by ﬁnding the vectors in the subspace spanned by
X that are “closest” to the corresponding observations y, where “clos-
est” means the smallest (squared) distance of the function values yn to
xnθ. This is achieved by orthogonal projections. Figure 9.12(b) shows the
projection of the noisy observations onto the subspace that minimizes the
squared distance between the original dataset and its projection (note that
the x-coordinate is ﬁxed), which corresponds to the maximum likelihood
solution.
In the general linear regression case where
y = φ⊤(x)θ + ϵ,
ϵ ∼N
 0, σ2
(9.68)
with vector-valued features φ(x) ∈RK, we again can interpret the maxi-
mum likelihood result
y ≈ΦθML ,
(9.69)
θML = (Φ⊤Φ)−1Φ⊤y
(9.70)
as a projection onto a K-dimensional subspace of RN, which is spanned
by the columns of the feature matrix Φ; see Section 3.8.2.
If the feature functions φk that we use to construct the feature ma-
trix Φ are orthonormal (see Section 3.7), we obtain a special case where
the columns of Φ form an orthonormal basis (see Section 3.5), such that
Φ⊤Φ = I. This will then lead to the projection
Φ(Φ⊤Φ)−1Φ⊤y = ΦΦ⊤y =

y
(9.71)
so that the maximum likelihood projection is simply the sum of projections
of y onto the individual basis vectors φk, i.e., the columns of Φ. Further-
more, the coupling between different features has disappeared due to the
orthogonality of the basis. Many popular basis functions in signal process-
ing, such as wavelets and Fourier bases, are orthogonal basis functions.

9.5 Further Reading
315
When the basis is not orthogonal, one can convert a set of linearly inde-
pendent basis functions to an orthogonal basis by using the Gram-Schmidt
process; see Section 3.8.3 and (Strang, 2003).
9.5 Further Reading
In this chapter, we discussed linear regression for Gaussian likelihoods
and conjugate Gaussian priors on the parameters of the model. This al-
lowed for closed-form Bayesian inference. However, in some applications
we may want to choose a different likelihood function. For example, in
a binary classiﬁcation setting, we observe only two possible (categorical)
classiﬁcation
outcomes, and a Gaussian likelihood is inappropriate in this setting. In-
stead, we can choose a Bernoulli likelihood that will return a probability of
the predicted label to be 1 (or 0). We refer to the books by Barber (2012),
Bishop (2006), and Murphy (2012) for an in-depth introduction to classiﬁ-
cation problems. A different example where non-Gaussian likelihoods are
important is count data. Counts are non-negative integers, and in this case
a Binomial or Poisson likelihood would be a better choice than a Gaussian.
All these examples fall into the category of generalized linear models, a ﬂex-
generalized linear
model

that have error distributions other than a Gaussian distribution. The GLM

generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related
to the observed values via a smooth and invertible function σ(·) that may
be nonlinear so that y = σ(f(x)), where f(x) = θ⊤φ(x) is the linear
regression model from (9.13). We can therefore think of a generalized
linear model in terms of function composition y = σ ◦f, where f is a
linear regression model and σ the activation function. Note that although
we are talking about “generalized linear models”, the outputs y are no
longer linear in the parameters θ. In logistic regression, we choose the
logistic regression
logistic sigmoid σ(f) =
1
1+exp(−f) ∈[0, 1], which can be interpreted as the
logistic sigmoid
probability of observing y = 1 of a Bernoulli random variable y ∈{0, 1}.
The function σ(·) is called transfer function or activation function, and its
transfer function

inverse is called the canonical link function. From this perspective, it is

also clear that generalized linear models are the building blocks of (deep)
feedforward neural networks: If we consider a generalized linear model
y = σ(Ax + b), where A is a weight matrix and b a bias vector, we iden-
tify this generalized linear model as a single-layer neural network with
activation function σ(·). We can now recursively compose these functions

Linear Regression
the generalized linear models deﬁned in (9.72). Neural networks (Bishop,
1995; Goodfellow et al., 2016) are signiﬁcantly more expressive and ﬂexi-
ble than linear regression models. However, maximum likelihood parame-
ter estimation is a non-convex optimization problem, and marginalization
of the parameters in a fully Bayesian setting is analytically intractable.
We brieﬂy hinted at the fact that a distribution over parameters in-
duces a distribution over regression functions. Gaussian processes (Ras-
Gaussian process
mussen and Williams, 2006) are regression models where the concept of
a distribution over function is central. Instead of placing a distribution
over parameters, a Gaussian process places a distribution directly on the
space of functions without the “detour” via the parameters. To do so, the
Gaussian process exploits the kernel trick (Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2002),
kernel trick
which allows us to compute inner products between two function values
f(xi), f(xj) only by looking at the corresponding input xi, xj. A Gaus-
sian process is closely related to both Bayesian linear regression and sup-
port vector regression but can also be interpreted as a Bayesian neural
network with a single hidden layer where the number of units tends to
inﬁnity (Neal, 1996; Williams, 1997). Excellent introductions to Gaussian
processes can be found in MacKay (1998) and Rasmussen and Williams
(2006).
We focused on Gaussian parameter priors in the discussions in this chap-
ter, because they allow for closed-form inference in linear regression mod-
els. However, even in a regression setting with Gaussian likelihoods, we
may choose a non-Gaussian prior. Consider a setting, where the inputs are
x ∈RD and our training set is small and of size N ≪D. This means that
the regression problem is underdetermined. In this case, we can choose
a parameter prior that enforces sparsity, i.e., a prior that tries to set as
many parameters to 0 as possible (variable selection). This prior provides
variable selection
a stronger regularizer than the Gaussian prior, which often leads to an in-
creased prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model. The Laplace
prior is one example that is frequently used for this purpose. A linear re-
gression model with the Laplace prior on the parameters is equivalent to
linear regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996). The
LASSO
Laplace distribution is sharply peaked at zero (its ﬁrst derivative is discon-
tinuous) and it concentrates its probability mass closer to zero than the
Gaussian distribution, which encourages parameters to be 0. Therefore,
the nonzero parameters are relevant for the regression problem, which is
the reason why we also speak of “variable selection”.

some difﬁculties: It is hard to analyze, interpretation is difﬁcult, visualiza-
tion is nearly impossible, and (from a practical point of view) storage of
the data vectors can be expensive. However, high-dimensional data often
has properties that we can exploit. For example, high-dimensional data is
often overcomplete, i.e., many dimensions are redundant and can be ex-
plained by a combination of other dimensions. Furthermore, dimensions
in high-dimensional data are often correlated so that the data possesses an
intrinsic lower-dimensional structure. Dimensionality reduction exploits
structure and correlation and allows us to work with a more compact rep-
resentation of the data, ideally without losing information. We can think
of dimensionality reduction as a compression technique, similar to jpeg or
mp3, which are compression algorithms for images and music.

our understanding of basis and basis change (Sections 2.6.1 and 2.7.2),

Dimensionality reduction generally exploits a property of high-dimen-
sional data (e.g., images) that it often lies on a low-dimensional subspace.
Figure 10.1 gives an illustrative example in two dimensions. Although
the data in Figure 10.1(a) does not quite lie on a line, the data does not
vary much in the x2-direction, so that we can express it as if it were on
a line – with nearly no loss; see Figure 10.1(b). To describe the data in
Figure 10.1(b), only the x1-coordinate is required, and the data lies in a

In PCA, we are interested in ﬁnding projections ˜xn of data points xn that
are as similar to the original data points as possible, but which have a sig-
niﬁcantly lower intrinsic dimensionality. Figure 10.1 gives an illustration
of what this could look like.
More concretely, we consider an i.i.d. dataset X = {x1, . . . , xN}, xn ∈
RD, with mean 0 that possesses the data covariance matrix (6.42)

denote the projected data by ˜xn ∈U, and their coordinates (with respect
to the basis vectors b1, . . . , bM of U) by zn. Our aim is to ﬁnd projections
˜xn ∈RD (or equivalently the codes zn and the basis vectors b1, . . . , bM)
so that they are as similar to the original data xn and minimize the loss
due to compression.

However, when we consider vectors of the form

z ∈R ,
(10.5)
they can always be written as 0e1 + ze2. To represent these vectors it is
sufﬁcient to remember/store the coordinate/code z of ˜x with respect to
the e2 vector.
The dimension of a
vector space
corresponds to the
number of its basis
vectors (see
Section 2.6.1).
More precisely, the set of ˜x vectors (with the standard vector addition
and scalar multiplication) forms a vector subspace U (see Section 2.4)
with dim(U) = 1 because U = span[e2].
In Section 10.2, we will ﬁnd low-dimensional representations that re-
tain as much information as possible and minimize the compression loss.
An alternative derivation of PCA is given in Section 10.3, where we will
be looking at minimizing the squared reconstruction error ∥xn −˜xn∥
2 be-
tween the original data xn and its projection ˜xn.
Figure 10.2 illustrates the setting we consider in PCA, where z repre-
sents the lower-dimensional representation of the compressed data ˜x and
plays the role of a bottleneck, which controls how much information can
ﬂow between x and ˜x. In PCA, we consider a linear relationship between
the original data x and its low-dimensional code z so that z = B⊤x and
˜x = Bz for a suitable matrix B. Based on the motivation of thinking
of PCA as a data compression technique, we can interpret the arrows in
Figure 10.2 as a pair of operations representing encoders and decoders.
The linear mapping represented by B can be thought of as a decoder,
which maps the low-dimensional code z ∈RM back into the original data
space RD. Similarly, B⊤can be thought of an encoder, which encodes the
original data x as a low-dimensional (compressed) code z.

occurring example, which contains 60,000 examples of handwritten digits
0 through 9. Each digit is a grayscale image of size 28×28, i.e., it contains
784 pixels so that we can interpret every image in this dataset as a vector
x ∈R784. Examples of these digits are shown in Figure 10.3.
10.2 Maximum Variance Perspective
Figure 10.1 gave an example of how a two-dimensional dataset can be
represented using a single coordinate. In Figure 10.1(b), we chose to ig-
nore the x2-coordinate of the data because it did not add too much in-
formation so that the compressed data is similar to the original data in
Figure 10.1(a). We could have chosen to ignore the x1-coordinate, but
then the compressed data had been very dissimilar from the original data,
and much information in the data would have been lost.
If we interpret information content in the data as how “space ﬁlling”
the dataset is, then we can describe the information contained in the data
by looking at the spread of the data. From Section 6.4.1, we know that the
variance is an indicator of the spread of the data, and we can derive PCA as
a dimensionality reduction algorithm that maximizes the variance in the
low-dimensional representation of the data to retain as much information
as possible. Figure 10.4 illustrates this.
Considering the setting discussed in Section 10.1, our aim is to ﬁnd
a matrix B (see (10.3)) that retains as much information as possible
when compressing data by projecting it onto the subspace spanned by
the columns b1, . . . , bM of B. Retaining most information after data com-
pression is equivalent to capturing the largest amount of variance in the
low-dimensional code (Hotelling, 1933).
Remark. (Centered Data) For the data covariance matrix in (10.1), we
assumed centered data. We can make this assumption without loss of gen-
erality: Let us assume that µ is the mean of the data. Using the properties
of the variance, which we discussed in Section 6.4.4, we obtain
Vz[z] = Vx[B⊤(x −µ)] = Vx[B⊤x −B⊤µ] = Vx[B⊤x] ,
(10.6)
i.e., the variance of the low-dimensional code does not depend on the
mean of the data. Therefore, we assume without loss of generality that the
data has mean 0 for the remainder of this section. With this assumption
the mean of the low-dimensional code is also 0 since Ez[z] = Ex[B⊤x] =
B⊤Ex[x] = 0.

By comparing this with the deﬁnition of an eigenvalue decomposition

ing eigenvalue. This eigenvector property (10.13) allows us to rewrite our

i.e., the variance of the data projected onto a one-dimensional subspace
equals the eigenvalue that is associated with the basis vector b1 that spans
this subspace. Therefore, to maximize the variance of the low-dimensional
code, we choose the basis vector associated with the largest eigenvalue
of the data covariance matrix. This eigenvector is called the ﬁrst principal

ponent b1 in the original data space by mapping the coordinate z1n back
into data space, which gives us the projected data point

Remark. Although ˜xn is a D-dimensional vector, it only requires a single

(m −1)-dimensional subspace of RD. Generally, the mth principal com-
ponent can be found by subtracting the effect of the ﬁrst m −1 principal
components b1, . . . , bm−1 from the data, thereby trying to ﬁnd principal
components that compress the remaining information. We then arrive at
the new data matrix

Remark (Notation). Throughout this chapter, we do not follow the con-
vention of collecting data x1, . . . , xN as the rows of the data matrix, but
we deﬁne them to be the columns of X. This means that our data ma-
trix X is a D × N matrix instead of the conventional N × D matrix. The
reason for our choice is that the algebra operations work out smoothly
without the need to either transpose the matrix or to redeﬁne vectors as
row vectors that are left-multiplied onto matrices.

X := {ˆx1, . . . , ˆxN}. As previously, when we looked at the ﬁrst principal
component alone, we solve a constrained optimization problem and dis-
cover that the optimal solution bm is the eigenvector of ˆS that is associated
with the largest eigenvalue of ˆS.
It turns out that bm is also an eigenvector of S. More generally, the sets
of eigenvectors of S and ˆS are identical. Since both S and ˆS are sym-
metric, we can ﬁnd an ONB of eigenvectors (spectral theorem 4.15), i.e.,
there exist D distinct eigenvectors for both S and ˆS. Next, we show that
every eigenvector of S is an eigenvector of ˆS. Assume we have already
found eigenvectors b1, . . . , bm−1 of ˆS. Consider an eigenvector bi of S,

nal to the ﬁrst m−1 principal components and Bm−1bi = 0. If i < m, i.e.,
bi is among the ﬁrst m −1 principal components, then bi is a basis vector

of the principal subspace onto which Bm−1 projects. Since b1, . . . , bm−1
are an ONB of this principal subspace, we obtain Bm−1bi = bi. The two
cases can be summarized as follows:
Bm−1bi = bi
if i < m ,
Bm−1bi = 0
if i ⩾m .
(10.20)
In the case i ⩾m, by using (10.20) in (10.19b), we obtain ˆSbi = (S −
Bm−1S)bi = Sbi = λibi , i.e., bi is also an eigenvector of ˆS with eigen-
value λi. Speciﬁcally,
ˆSbm = Sbm = λmbm .
(10.21)
Equation (10.21) reveals that bm is not only an eigenvector of S but also
of ˆS. Speciﬁcally, λm is the largest eigenvalue of ˆS and λm is the mth
largest eigenvalue of S, and both have the associated eigenvector bm.
In the case i < m, by using (10.20) in (10.19b), we obtain
ˆSbi = (S −SBm−1 −Bm−1S + Bm−1SBm−1)bi = 0 = 0bi
(10.22)
This means that b1, . . . , bm−1 are also eigenvectors of ˆS, but they are as-
sociated with eigenvalue 0 so that b1, . . . , bm−1 span the null space of ˆS.
Overall, every eigenvector of S is also an eigenvector of ˆS. However,
if the eigenvectors of S are part of the (m −1) dimensional principal
subspace, then the associated eigenvalue of ˆS is 0.
This derivation
shows that there is
an intimate
connection between
the M-dimensional
subspace with
maximal variance
and the eigenvalue
decomposition. We
will revisit this
connection in
Section 10.4.
With the relation (10.21) and b⊤

jected onto the mth principal component is
Vm = b⊤
mSbm
(10.21)

mbm = λm .
(10.23)
This means that the variance of the data, when projected onto an M-
dimensional subspace, equals the sum of the eigenvalues that are associ-
ated with the corresponding eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix.

Taking all digits “8” in the MNIST training data, we compute the eigen-
values of the data covariance matrix. Figure 10.5(a) shows the 200 largest
eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix. We see that only a few of
them have a value that differs signiﬁcantly from 0. Therefore, most of
the variance, when projecting data onto the subspace spanned by the cor-
responding eigenvectors, is captured by only a few principal components,
as shown in Figure 10.5(b).
Overall, to ﬁnd an M-dimensional subspace of RD that retains as much
information as possible, PCA tells us to choose the columns of the matrix
B in (10.3) as the M eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S that
are associated with the M largest eigenvalues. The maximum amount of
variance PCA can capture with the ﬁrst M principal components is
VM =

Assume an (ordered) orthonormal basis (ONB) B = (b1, . . . , bD) of RD,
i.e., b⊤
i bj = 1 if and only if i = j and 0 otherwise.
From Section 2.5 we know that for a basis (b1, . . . , bD) of RD any x ∈
RD can be written as a linear combination of the basis vectors of RD, i.e.,
Vectors ˜x ∈U could

is as similar to x as possible. Note that at this point we need to assume
that the coordinates zm of ˜x and ζm of x are not identical.
In the following, we use exactly this kind of representation of ˜x to ﬁnd
optimal coordinates z and basis vectors b1, . . . , bM such that ˜x is as sim-
ilar to the original data point x as possible, i.e., we aim to minimize the
(Euclidean) distance ∥x −˜x∥. Figure 10.7 illustrates this setting.
Without loss of generality, we assume that the dataset X = {x1, . . . , xN},
xn ∈RD, is centered at 0, i.e., E[X] = 0. Without the zero-mean assump-

be substantially more cluttered.

having the ˜xn as similar to xn as possible.
The similarity measure we use in the following is the squared distance

where we make it explicit that the dimension of the subspace onto which
we project the data is M. In order to ﬁnd this optimal linear projection,
we need to ﬁnd the orthonormal basis of the principal subspace and the
coordinates zn ∈RM of the projections with respect to this basis.
To ﬁnd the coordinates zn and the ONB of the principal subspace, we
follow a two-step approach. First, we optimize the coordinates zn for a
given ONB (b1, . . . , bM); second, we ﬁnd the optimal ONB.
10.3.2 Finding Optimal Coordinates
Let us start by ﬁnding the optimal coordinates z1n, . . . , zMn of the projec-
tions ˜xn for n = 1, . . . , N. Consider Figure 10.7(b), where the principal
subspace is spanned by a single vector b. Geometrically speaking, ﬁnding
the optimal coordinates z corresponds to ﬁnding the representation of the
linear projection ˜x with respect to b that minimizes the distance between
˜x −x. From Figure 10.7(b), it is clear that this will be the orthogonal
projection, and in the following we will show exactly this.
We assume an ONB (b1, . . . , bM) of U ⊆RD. To ﬁnd the optimal co-
ordinates zm with respect to this basis, we require the partial derivatives

must be identical for m = 1, . . . , M since U ⊥= span[bM+1, . . . , bD] is
the orthogonal complement (see Section 3.6) of U = span[b1, . . . , bM].
Remark (Orthogonal Projections with Orthonormal Basis Vectors). Let us
brieﬂy recap orthogonal projections from Section 3.8. If (b1, . . . , bD) is an
orthonormal basis of RD then
b⊤
j x is the
coordinate of the
orthogonal
projection of x onto
the subspace
spanned by bj.
˜x = bj(b⊤
j bj)−1b⊤
j x = bjb⊤
j x ∈RD
(10.33)
is the orthogonal projection of x onto the subspace spanned by the jth ba-
sis vector, and zj = b⊤
j x is the coordinate of this projection with respect to
the basis vector bj that spans that subspace since zjbj = ˜x. Figure 10.8(b)
illustrates this setting.
More generally, if we aim to project onto an M-dimensional subspace
of RD, we obtain the orthogonal projection of x onto the M-dimensional
subspace with orthonormal basis vectors b1, . . . , bM as
˜x = B(B⊤B
| {z }
=I
)−1B⊤x = BB⊤x ,
(10.34)
where we deﬁned B := [b1, . . . , bM] ∈RD×M. The coordinates of this
projection with respect to the ordered basis (b1, . . . , bM) are z := B⊤x
as discussed in Section 3.8.
We can think of the coordinates as a representation of the projected
vector in a new coordinate system deﬁned by (b1, . . . , bM). Note that al-
though ˜x ∈RD, we only need M coordinates z1, . . . , zM to represent
this vector; the other D −M coordinates with respect to the basis vectors
(bM+1, . . . , bD) are always 0.
♦
So far we have shown that for a given ONB we can ﬁnd the optimal
coordinates of ˜x by an orthogonal projection onto the principal subspace.
In the following, we will determine what the best basis is.
10.3.3 Finding the Basis of the Principal Subspace
To determine the basis vectors b1, . . . , bM of the principal subspace, we
rephrase the loss function (10.29) using the results we have so far. This

to minimize (10.44) we need to select the smallest D −M eigenvalues,

the orthogonal complement of the principal subspace. Consequently, this
means that the basis of the principal subspace comprises the eigenvectors
b1, . . . , bM that are associated with the largest M eigenvalues of the data
covariance matrix.

Note that X is a D × N matrix, i.e., it is the transpose of the “typical”
data matrix (Bishop, 2006; Murphy, 2012). To get the eigenvalues (and
the corresponding eigenvectors) of S, we can follow two approaches:
Use
eigendecomposition
or SVD to compute
eigenvectors.
We perform an eigendecomposition (see Section 4.2) and compute the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of S directly.
We use a singular value decomposition (see Section 4.5). Since S is
symmetric and factorizes into XX⊤(ignoring the factor 1
N ), the eigen-
values of S are the squared singular values of X.
More speciﬁcally, the SVD of X is given by

10.4.1 PCA Using Low-Rank Matrix Approximations
To maximize the variance of the projected data (or minimize the average
squared reconstruction error), PCA chooses the columns of U in (10.48)
to be the eigenvectors that are associated with the M largest eigenvalues
of the data covariance matrix S so that we identify U as the projection ma-
trix B in (10.3), which projects the original data onto a lower-dimensional
subspace of dimension M. The Eckart-Young theorem (Theorem 4.25 in
Eckart-Young
theorem
Section 4.6) offers a direct way to estimate the low-dimensional represen-
tation. Consider the best rank-M approximation
˜XM := argminrk(A)⩽M ∥X −A∥2 ∈RD×N
(10.50)
of X, where ∥·∥2 is the spectral norm deﬁned in (4.93). The Eckart-Young
theorem states that ˜XM is given by truncating the SVD at the top-M
singular value. In other words, we obtain
˜XM = U M

[v1, . . . , vM] ∈RN×M and a diagonal matrix ΣM ∈RM×M whose diago-
nal entries are the M largest singular values of X.
10.4.2 Practical Aspects
Finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors is also important in other funda-
mental machine learning methods that require matrix decompositions. In
theory, as we discussed in Section 4.2, we can solve for the eigenvalues as
roots of the characteristic polynomial. However, for matrices larger than
4×4 this is not possible because we would need to ﬁnd the roots of a poly-
nomial of degree 5 or higher. However, the Abel-Rufﬁni theorem (Rufﬁni,
Abel-Rufﬁni
theorem
1799; Abel, 1826) states that there exists no algebraic solution to this
problem for polynomials of degree 5 or more. Therefore, in practice, we
np.linalg.eigh
or
np.linalg.svd
solve for eigenvalues or singular values using iterative methods, which are
implemented in all modern packages for linear algebra.
In many applications (such as PCA presented in this chapter), we only
require a few eigenvectors. It would be wasteful to compute the full de-
composition, and then discard all eigenvectors with eigenvalues that are
beyond the ﬁrst few. It turns out that if we are interested in only the ﬁrst
few eigenvectors (with the largest eigenvalues), then iterative processes,
which directly optimize these eigenvectors, are computationally more efﬁ-
cient than a full eigendecomposition (or SVD). In the extreme case of only
needing the ﬁrst eigenvector, a simple method called the power iteration
power iteration
is very efﬁcient. Power iteration chooses a random vector x0 that is not in

normalized, i.e., we always have ∥xk∥= 1. This sequence of vectors con-
verges to the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of S. The
original Google PageRank algorithm (Page et al., 1999) uses such an al-
gorithm for ranking web pages based on their hyperlinks.
10.5 PCA in High Dimensions
In order to do PCA, we need to compute the data covariance matrix. In D
dimensions, the data covariance matrix is a D ×D matrix. Computing the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix is computationally expensive
as it scales cubically in D. Therefore, PCA, as we discussed earlier, will be
infeasible in very high dimensions. For example, if our xn are images with
10,000 pixels (e.g., 100 × 100 pixel images), we would need to compute
the eigendecomposition of a 10,000 × 10,000 covariance matrix. In the
following, we provide a solution to this problem for the case that we have
substantially fewer data points than dimensions, i.e., N ≪D.
Assume we have a centered dataset x1, . . . , xN, xn ∈RD. Then the
data covariance matrix is given as
S = 1
N XX⊤∈RD×D ,
(10.53)
where X = [x1, . . . , xN] is a D × N matrix whose columns are the data
points.
We now assume that N ≪D, i.e., the number of data points is smaller
than the dimensionality of the data. If there are no duplicate data points,
the rank of the covariance matrix S is N, so it has D −N +1 many eigen-
values that are 0. Intuitively, this means that there are some redundancies.
In the following, we will exploit this and turn the D×D covariance matrix
into an N × N covariance matrix whose eigenvalues are all positive.
In PCA, we ended up with the eigenvector equation
Sbm = λmbm ,
m = 1, . . . , M ,
(10.54)
where bm is a basis vector of the principal subspace. Let us rewrite this
equation a bit: With S deﬁned in (10.53), we obtain
Sbm = 1
N XX⊤bm = λmbm .
(10.55)
We now multiply X⊤∈RN×D from the left-hand side, which yields

c⃝2021 M. P. Deisenroth, A. A. Faisal, C. S. Ong. Published by Cambridge University Press (2020).

336
Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis
and we get a new eigenvector/eigenvalue equation: λm remains eigen-
value, which conﬁrms our results from Section 4.5.3 that the nonzero
eigenvalues of XX⊤equal the nonzero eigenvalues of X⊤X. We obtain
the eigenvector of the matrix
1
N X⊤X ∈RN×N associated with λm as
cm := X⊤bm. Assuming we have no duplicate data points, this matrix
has rank N and is invertible. This also implies that
1
N X⊤X has the same
(nonzero) eigenvalues as the data covariance matrix S. But this is now an
N × N matrix, so that we can compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
much more efﬁciently than for the original D ×D data covariance matrix.
Now that we have the eigenvectors of
1
N X⊤X, we are going to re-
cover the original eigenvectors, which we still need for PCA. Currently,
we know the eigenvectors of
1
N X⊤X. If we left-multiply our eigenvalue/
eigenvector equation with X, we get
1
N XX⊤

{z

S
Xcm = λmXcm
(10.57)
and we recover the data covariance matrix again. This now also means
that we recover Xcm as an eigenvector of S.
Remark. If we want to apply the PCA algorithm that we discussed in Sec-
tion 10.6, we need to normalize the eigenvectors Xcm of S so that they
have norm 1.

10.6 Key Steps of PCA in Practice
In the following, we will go through the individual steps of PCA using a
running example, which is summarized in Figure 10.11. We are given a
two-dimensional dataset (Figure 10.11(a)), and we want to use PCA to
project it onto a one-dimensional subspace.
1. Mean subtraction
We start by centering the data by computing the
mean µ of the dataset and subtracting it from every single data point.
This ensures that the dataset has mean 0 (Figure 10.11(b)). Mean sub-
traction is not strictly necessary but reduces the risk of numerical prob-
lems.
2. Standardization
Divide the data points by the standard deviation σd
of the dataset for every dimension d = 1, . . . , D. Now the data is unit
free, and it has variance 1 along each axis, which is indicated by the
two arrows in Figure 10.11(c). This step completes the standardization

3. Eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix

covariance matrix and its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors.
Since the covariance matrix is symmetric, the spectral theorem (The-
orem 4.15) states that we can ﬁnd an ONB of eigenvectors. In Fig-
ure 10.11(d), the eigenvectors are scaled by the magnitude of the cor-

4. Projection
We can project any data point x∗∈RD onto the principal
subspace: To get this right, we need to standardize x∗using the mean

respectively, so that

with respect to the basis of the principal subspace. Here, B is the ma-

the context of the standardized dataset. To obtain our projection in the

an image of size 28×28, i.e., it contains 784 pixels so that we can interpret
every image in this dataset as a vector x ∈R784. Examples of these digits
are shown in Figure 10.3.

For illustration purposes, we apply PCA to a subset of the MNIST digits,
and we focus on the digit “8”. We used 5,389 training images of the digit
“8” and determined the principal subspace as detailed in this chapter. We
then used the learned projection matrix to reconstruct a set of test im-
ages, which is illustrated in Figure 10.12. The ﬁrst row of Figure 10.12
shows a set of four original digits from the test set. The following rows
show reconstructions of exactly these digits when using a principal sub-
space of dimensions 1, 10, 100, and 500, respectively. We see that even
with a single-dimensional principal subspace we get a halfway decent re-
construction of the original digits, which, however, is blurry and generic.
With an increasing number of principal components (PCs), the reconstruc-
tions become sharper and more details are accounted for. With 500 prin-

we were to choose 784 PCs, we would recover the exact digit without any
compression loss.

the importance of the principal components drops off rapidly, and only
marginal gains can be achieved by adding more PCs. This matches exactly
our observation in Figure 10.5, where we discovered that the most of the
variance of the projected data is captured by only a few principal compo-
nents. With about 550 PCs, we can essentially fully reconstruct the training
data that contains the digit “8” (some pixels around the boundaries show
no variation across the dataset as they are always black).

10.7 Latent Variable Perspective
In the previous sections, we derived PCA without any notion of a prob-
abilistic model using the maximum-variance and the projection perspec-
tives. On the one hand, this approach may be appealing as it allows us to
sidestep all the mathematical difﬁculties that come with probability the-
ory, but on the other hand, a probabilistic model would offer us more ﬂex-
ibility and useful insights. More speciﬁcally, a probabilistic model would

By introducing a continuous-valued latent variable z ∈RM it is possible
to phrase PCA as a probabilistic latent-variable model. Tipping and Bishop
(1999) proposed this latent-variable model as probabilistic PCA (PPCA).

PPCA
PPCA addresses most of the aforementioned issues, and the PCA solution
that we obtained by maximizing the variance in the projected space or
by minimizing the reconstruction error is obtained as the special case of
maximum likelihood estimation in a noise-free setting.
10.7.1 Generative Process and Probabilistic Model
In PPCA, we explicitly write down the probabilistic model for linear di-
mensionality reduction. For this we assume a continuous latent variable
z ∈RM with a standard-normal prior p(z) = N
 0, I

and a linear rela-
tionship between the latent variables and the observed x data where
x = Bz + µ + ϵ ∈RD ,
(10.63)
where ϵ ∼N
 0, σ2I

is Gaussian observation noise and B ∈RD×M
and µ ∈RD describe the linear/afﬁne mapping from latent to observed
variables. Therefore, PPCA links latent and observed variables via
p(x|z, B, µ, σ2) = N
 x | Bz + µ, σ2I
 .
(10.64)
Overall, PPCA induces the following generative process:
zn ∼N
 z | 0, I

(10.65)
xn | zn ∼N
 x | Bzn + µ, σ2I

(10.66)
To generate a data point that is typical given the model parameters, we
follow an ancestral sampling scheme: We ﬁrst sample a latent variable zn
ancestral sampling
from p(z). Then we use zn in (10.64) to sample a data point conditioned
on the sampled zn, i.e., xn ∼p(x | zn, B, µ, σ2).
This generative process allows us to write down the probabilistic model
(i.e., the joint distribution of all random variables; see Section 8.4) as
p(x, z|B, µ, σ2) = p(x|z, B, µ, σ2)p(z) ,
(10.67)
which immediately gives rise to the graphical model in Figure 10.14 using
the results from Section 8.5.

Remark. Note the direction of the arrow that connects the latent variables
z and the observed data x: The arrow points from z to x, which means
that the PPCA model assumes a lower-dimensional latent cause z for high-
dimensional observations x. In the end, we are obviously interested in
ﬁnding something out about z given some observations. To get there we
will apply Bayesian inference to “invert” the arrow implicitly and go from
observations to latent variables.

(shape, rotation, size, etc.). If we query away from the training data, we
see more an more artifacts, e.g., the top-left and top-right digits. Note that
the intrinsic dimensionality of these generated images is only two.

10.7.2 Likelihood and Joint Distribution
The likelihood does
not depend on the
latent variables z.
Using the results from Chapter 6, we obtain the likelihood of this proba-
bilistic model by integrating out the latent variable z (see Section 8.4.3)
so that
p(x | B, µ, σ2) =
Z
p(x | z, B, µ, σ2)p(z)dz

 x | Bz + µ, σ2I

(10.68b)
From Section 6.5, we know that the solution to this integral is a Gaussian
distribution with mean
Ex[x] = Ez[Bz + µ] + Eϵ[ϵ] = µ
(10.69)
and with covariance matrix
V[x] = Vz[Bz + µ] + Vϵ[ϵ] = Vz[Bz] + σ2I
(10.70a)
= BVz[z]B⊤+ σ2I = BB⊤+ σ2I .
(10.70b)
The likelihood in (10.68b) can be used for maximum likelihood or MAP
estimation of the model parameters.
Remark. We cannot use the conditional distribution in (10.64) for maxi-
mum likelihood estimation as it still depends on the latent variables. The
likelihood function we require for maximum likelihood (or MAP) estima-
tion should only be a function of the data x and the model parameters,
but must not depend on the latent variables.
♦
From Section 6.5, we know that a Gaussian random variable z and
a linear/afﬁne transformation x = Bz of it are jointly Gaussian dis-
tributed. We already know the marginals p(z) = N

. The missing cross-covariance is given as
Cov[x, z] = Covz[Bz + µ] = B Covz[z, z] = B .
(10.71)
Therefore, the probabilistic model of PPCA, i.e., the joint distribution of
latent and observed random variables is explicitly given by

10.7.3 Posterior Distribution
The joint Gaussian distribution p(x, z | B, µ, σ2) in (10.72) allows us to
determine the posterior distribution p(z | x) immediately by applying the

rules of Gaussian conditioning from Section 6.5.1. The posterior distribu-
tion of the latent variable given an observation x is then
p(z | x) = N
 z | m, C

(10.73)
m = B⊤(BB⊤+ σ2I)−1(x −µ) ,
(10.74)
C = I −B⊤(BB⊤+ σ2I)−1B .
(10.75)
Note that the posterior covariance does not depend on the observed data
x. For a new observation x∗in data space, we use (10.73) to determine
the posterior distribution of the corresponding latent variable z∗. The co-
variance matrix C allows us to assess how conﬁdent the embedding is. A
covariance matrix C with a small determinant (which measures volumes)
tells us that the latent embedding z∗is fairly certain. If we obtain a pos-
terior distribution p(z∗| x∗) with much variance, we may be faced with
an outlier. However, we can explore this posterior distribution to under-
stand what other data points x are plausible under this posterior. To do
this, we exploit the generative process underlying PPCA, which allows us
to explore the posterior distribution on the latent variables by generating
new data that is plausible under this posterior:
1. Sample a latent variable z∗∼p(z | x∗) from the posterior distribution
over the latent variables (10.73).
2. Sample a reconstructed vector ˜x∗∼p(x | z∗, B, µ, σ2) from (10.64).
If we repeat this process many times, we can explore the posterior dis-
tribution (10.73) on the latent variables z∗and its implications on the
observed data. The sampling process effectively hypothesizes data, which
is plausible under the posterior distribution.
10.8 Further Reading
We derived PCA from two perspectives: (a) maximizing the variance in the
projected space; (b) minimizing the average reconstruction error. How-
ever, PCA can also be interpreted from different perspectives. Let us recap
what we have done: We took high-dimensional data x ∈RD and used
a matrix B⊤to ﬁnd a lower-dimensional representation z ∈RM. The
columns of B are the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix S that are
associated with the largest eigenvalues. Once we have a low-dimensional
representation z, we can get a high-dimensional version of it (in the orig-
inal data space) as x ≈˜x = Bz = BB⊤x ∈RD, where BB⊤is a
projection matrix.
We can also think of PCA as a linear auto-encoder as illustrated in Fig-

and decodes it to a ˜xn similar to xn. The mapping from the data to the

This means we end up with the same objective function as in (10.29) that
we discussed in Section 10.3 so that we obtain the PCA solution when we
minimize the squared auto-encoding loss. If we replace the linear map-
ping of PCA with a nonlinear mapping, we get a nonlinear auto-encoder.
A prominent example of this is a deep auto-encoder where the linear func-
tions are replaced with deep neural networks. In this context, the encoder
is also known as a recognition network or inference network, whereas the
recognition network

decoder is also called a generator.

Another interpretation of PCA is related to information theory. We can
think of the code as a smaller or compressed version of the original data
point. When we reconstruct our original data using the code, we do not
get the exact data point back, but a slightly distorted or noisy version
of it. This means that our compression is “lossy”. Intuitively, we want

of the original data.
to maximize the correlation between the original data and the lower-
dimensional code. More formally, this is related to the mutual information.
We would then get the same solution to PCA we discussed in Section 10.3
by maximizing the mutual information, a core concept in information the-
ory (MacKay, 2003).
In our discussion on PPCA, we assumed that the parameters of the
model, i.e., B, µ, and the likelihood parameter σ2, are known. Tipping
and Bishop (1999) describe how to derive maximum likelihood estimates
for these parameters in the PPCA setting (note that we use a different
notation in this chapter). The maximum likelihood parameters, when pro-

Λ = diag(λ1, . . . , λM) ∈RM×M is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues
associated with the principal axes on its diagonal, and R ∈RM×M is
an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. The maximum likelihood solution BML is
unique up to an arbitrary orthogonal transformation, e.g., we can right-
multiply BML with any rotation matrix R so that (10.78) essentially is a
singular value decomposition (see Section 4.5). An outline of the proof is
given by Tipping and Bishop (1999).
The maximum likelihood estimate for µ given in (10.77) is the sample
mean of the data. The maximum likelihood estimator for the observation
noise variance σ2 given in (10.79) is the average variance in the orthog-
onal complement of the principal subspace, i.e., the average leftover vari-
ance that we cannot capture with the ﬁrst M principal components is
treated as observation noise.
In the noise-free limit where σ →0, PPCA and PCA provide identical
solutions: Since the data covariance matrix S is symmetric, it can be di-
agonalized (see Section 4.4), i.e., there exists a matrix T of eigenvectors
of S so that
S = T ΛT −1 .
(10.80)
In the PPCA model, the data covariance matrix is the covariance matrix of
the Gaussian likelihood p(x | B, µ, σ2), which is BB⊤+σ2I, see (10.70b).
For σ →0, we obtain BB⊤so that this data covariance must equal the
PCA data covariance (and its factorization given in (10.80)) so that

i.e., we obtain the maximum likelihood estimate in (10.78) for σ = 0.
From (10.78) and (10.80), it becomes clear that (P)PCA performs a de-
composition of the data covariance matrix.
In a streaming setting, where data arrives sequentially, it is recom-
mended to use the iterative expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for
maximum likelihood estimation (Roweis, 1998).
To determine the dimensionality of the latent variables (the length of
the code, the dimensionality of the lower-dimensional subspace onto which
we project the data), Gavish and Donoho (2014) suggest the heuristic
that, if we can estimate the noise variance σ2 of the data, we should

3 . Alternatively, we can use
(nested) cross-validation (Section 8.6.1) or Bayesian model selection cri-
teria (discussed in Section 8.6.2) to determine a good estimate of the
intrinsic dimensionality of the data (Minka, 2001b).
Similar to our discussion on linear regression in Chapter 9, we can place
a prior distribution on the parameters of the model and integrate them
out. By doing so, we (a) avoid point estimates of the parameters and the
issues that come with these point estimates (see Section 8.6) and (b) al-
low for an automatic selection of the appropriate dimensionality M of the
latent space. In this Bayesian PCA, which was proposed by Bishop (1999),
Bayesian PCA
a prior p(µ, B, σ2) is placed on the model parameters. The generative
process allows us to integrate the model parameters out instead of condi-
tioning on them, which addresses overﬁtting issues. Since this integration
is analytically intractable, Bishop (1999) proposes to use approximate in-
ference methods, such as MCMC or variational inference. We refer to the
work by Gilks et al. (1996) and Blei et al. (2017) for more details on these
approximate inference techniques.

need to use an iterative scheme, such as the expectation maximization

ary points are global optima, this no longer holds for FA. Compared to
PPCA, FA does not change if we scale the data, but it does return different
solutions if we rotate the data.

many people talking. Your ears play the role of microphones, and they
linearly mix different speech signals in the train station. The goal of blind-

As discussed previously in the context of maximum likelihood estimation
for PPCA, the original PCA solution is invariant to any rotation. Therefore,
PCA can identify the best lower-dimensional subspace in which the sig-
nals live, but not the signals themselves (Murphy, 2012). ICA addresses
this issue by modifying the prior distribution p(z) on the latent sources

to require non-Gaussian priors p(z). We refer to the books by Hyvarinen
et al. (2001) and Murphy (2012) for more details on ICA.
PCA, factor analysis, and ICA are three examples for dimensionality re-
duction with linear models. Cunningham and Ghahramani (2015) provide
a broader survey of linear dimensionality reduction.
The (P)PCA model we discussed here allows for several important ex-
tensions. In Section 10.5, we explained how to do PCA when the in-
put dimensionality D is signiﬁcantly greater than the number N of data
points. By exploiting the insight that PCA can be performed by computing
(many) inner products, this idea can be pushed to the extreme by consid-
ering inﬁnite-dimensional features. The kernel trick is the basis of kernel

PCA and allows us to implicitly compute inner products between inﬁnite-
dimensional features (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1998; Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2002).
There are nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques that are de-
rived from PCA (Burges (2010) provides a good overview). The auto-
encoder perspective of PCA that we discussed previously in this section
can be used to render PCA as a special case of a deep auto-encoder. In the

deep auto-encoder, both the encoder and the decoder are represented by
multilayer feedforward neural networks, which themselves are nonlinear
mappings. If we set the activation functions in these neural networks to be

parameters and makes point estimates of the latent variables z. Similar
to Bayesian PCA, the Bayesian GP-LVM proposed by Titsias and Lawrence

Density Estimation with Gaussian Mixture
Models
In earlier chapters, we covered already two fundamental problems in
machine learning: regression (Chapter 9) and dimensionality reduction
(Chapter 10). In this chapter, we will have a look at a third pillar of ma-
chine learning: density estimation. On our journey, we introduce impor-
tant concepts, such as the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and
a latent variable perspective of density estimation with mixture models.
When we apply machine learning to data we often aim to represent
data in some way. A straightforward way is to take the data points them-
selves as the representation of the data; see Figure 11.1 for an example.
However, this approach may be unhelpful if the dataset is huge or if we
are interested in representing characteristics of the data. In density esti-
mation, we represent the data compactly using a density from a paramet-
ric family, e.g., a Gaussian or Beta distribution. For example, we may be
looking for the mean and variance of a dataset in order to represent the
data compactly using a Gaussian distribution. The mean and variance can
be found using tools we discussed in Section 8.3: maximum likelihood or
maximum a posteriori estimation. We can then use the mean and variance
of this Gaussian to represent the distribution underlying the data, i.e., we
think of the dataset to be a typical realization from this distribution if we
were to sample from it.

11.1 Gaussian Mixture Model
349
In practice, the Gaussian (or similarly all other distributions we encoun-
tered so far) have limited modeling capabilities. For example, a Gaussian
approximation of the density that generated the data in Figure 11.1 would
be a poor approximation. In the following, we will look at a more ex-
pressive family of distributions, which we can use for density estimation:
mixture models.

Mixture models are more expressive than the corresponding base distri-
butions because they allow for multimodal data representations, i.e., they
can describe datasets with multiple “clusters”, such as the example in Fig-
ure 11.1.
We will focus on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), where the basic
distributions are Gaussians. For a given dataset, we aim to maximize the
likelihood of the model parameters to train the GMM. For this purpose,
we will use results from Chapter 5, Chapter 6, and Section 7.2. However,
unlike other applications we discussed earlier (linear regression or PCA),
we will not ﬁnd a closed-form maximum likelihood solution. Instead, we
will arrive at a set of dependent simultaneous equations, which we can
only solve iteratively.

11.2 Parameter Learning via Maximum Likelihood
Assume we are given a dataset X = {x1, . . . , xN}, where xn, n =
1, . . . , N, are drawn i.i.d. from an unknown distribution p(x). Our ob-
jective is to ﬁnd a good approximation/representation of this unknown
distribution p(x) by means of a GMM with K mixture components. The
parameters of the GMM are the K means µk, the covariances Σk, and
mixture weights πk. We summarize all these free parameters in θ :=
{πk, µk, Σk : k = 1, . . . , K}.

11.2 Parameter Learning via Maximum Likelihood

We consider a one-dimensional dataset X = {−3, −2.5, −1, 0, 2, 4, 5}
consisting of seven data points and wish to ﬁnd a GMM with K = 3
components that models the density of the data. We initialize the mixture
components as

model (and the data points) are shown in Figure 11.3.
In the following, we detail how to obtain a maximum likelihood esti-
mate θML of the model parameters θ. We start by writing down the like-
lihood, i.e., the predictive distribution of the training data given the pa-
rameters. We exploit our i.i.d. assumption, which leads to the factorized
likelihood

We aim to ﬁnd parameters θ∗
ML that maximize the log-likelihood L deﬁned
in (11.10). Our “normal” procedure would be to compute the gradient
dL/dθ of the log-likelihood with respect to the model parameters θ, set
it to 0, and solve for θ. However, unlike our previous examples for max-
imum likelihood estimation (e.g., when we discussed linear regression in
Section 9.2), we cannot obtain a closed-form solution. However, we can
exploit an iterative scheme to ﬁnd good model parameters θML, which will
turn out to be the EM algorithm for GMMs. The key idea is to update one
model parameter at a time while keeping the others ﬁxed.
Remark. If we were to consider a single Gaussian as the desired density,
the sum over k in (11.10) vanishes, and the log can be applied directly to
the Gaussian component, such that we get

mates of µ and Σ, as discussed in Chapter 8. In (11.10), we cannot move

maximum likelihood solution.
♦
Any local optimum of a function exhibits the property that its gradi-
ent with respect to the parameters must vanish (necessary condition); see
Chapter 7. In our case, we obtain the following necessary conditions when
we optimize the log-likelihood in (11.10) with respect to the GMM param-
eters µk, Σk, πk:

In the following, we will compute the partial derivatives (11.12) through
(11.14). But before we do this, we introduce a quantity that will play a
central role in the remainder of this chapter: responsibilities.

Here the nth row tells us the responsibilities of all mixture components
for xn. The sum of all K responsibilities for a data point (sum of every
row) is 1. The kth column gives us an overview of the responsibility of
the kth mixture component. We can see that the third mixture component
(third column) is not responsible for any of the ﬁrst four data points, but
takes much responsibility of the remaining data points. The sum of all
entries of a column gives us the values Nk, i.e., the total responsibility of
the kth mixture component. In our example, we get N1 = 2.058, N2 =
2.008, N3 = 2.934.
In the following, we determine the updates of the model parameters
µk, Σk, πk for given responsibilities. We will see that the update equa-
tions all depend on the responsibilities, which makes a closed-form solu-
tion to the maximum likelihood estimation problem impossible. However,
for given responsibilities we will be updating one model parameter at a
time, while keeping the others ﬁxed. After this, we will recompute the
responsibilities. Iterating these two steps will eventually converge to a lo-
cal optimum and is a speciﬁc instantiation of the EM algorithm. We will
discuss this in some more detail in Section 11.3.

Density Estimation with Gaussian Mixture Models
Remark. The update of the means µk of the individual mixture compo-
nents in (11.20) depends on all means, covariance matrices Σk, and mix-
ture weights πk via rnk given in (11.17). Therefore, we cannot obtain a
closed-form solution for all µk at once.

Proof
From (11.15), we see that the gradient of the log-likelihood with

Carlo estimate of the mean, where the importance weights of data point
xn are the responsibilities rnk of the kth cluster for xn, k = 1, . . . , K.

move toward the regime of the data, whereas the mean of the second
component does not change so dramatically. Figure 11.5 illustrates this
change, where Figure 11.5(a) shows the GMM density prior to updating
the means and Figure 11.5(b) shows the GMM density after updating the
mean values µk.
The update of the mean parameters in (11.20) look fairly straight-
forward. However, note that the responsibilities rnk are a function of
πj, µj, Σj for all j = 1, . . . , K, such that the updates in (11.20) depend
on all parameters of the GMM, and a closed-form solution, which we ob-
tained for linear regression in Section 9.2 or PCA in Chapter 10, cannot
be obtained.

Similar to the update of the mean parameters, we can interpret (11.30)

responsibilities rnk. As with the updates of the mean parameters, this up-
date depends on all πj, µj, Σj, j = 1, . . . , K, through the responsibilities
rnk, which prohibits a closed-form solution.

of the GMM are updated as

rem 11.3.
We can identify the mixture weight in (11.42) as the ratio of the to-
tal responsibility of the kth cluster and the number of data points. Since
N = P
k Nk, the number of data points can also be interpreted as the
total responsibility of all mixture components together, such that πk is the
relative importance of the kth mixture component for the dataset.
Remark. Since Nk = PN
i=1 rnk, the update equation (11.42) for the mix-
ture weights πk also depends on all πj, µj, Σj, j = 1, . . . , K via the re-
sponsibilities rnk.

Here we see that the third component gets more weight/importance,
while the other components become slightly less important. Figure 11.7
illustrates the effect of updating the mixture weights. Figure 11.7(a) is
identical to Figure 11.6(b) and shows the GMM density and its individual
components prior to updating the mixture weights. Figure 11.7(b) shows
the GMM density after updating the mixture weights.
Overall, having updated the means, the variances, and the weights
once, we obtain the GMM shown in Figure 11.7(b). Compared with the
initialization shown in Figure 11.3, we can see that the parameter updates
caused the GMM density to shift some of its mass toward the data points.
After updating the means, variances, and weights once, the GMM ﬁt
in Figure 11.7(b) is already remarkably better than its initialization from
Figure 11.3. This is also evidenced by the log-likelihood values, which in-
creased from 28.3 (initialization) to 14.4 after one complete update cycle.
11.3 EM Algorithm
Unfortunately, the updates in (11.20), (11.30), and (11.42) do not consti-
tute a closed-form solution for the updates of the parameters µk, Σk, πk
of the mixture model because the responsibilities rnk depend on those pa-
rameters in a complex way. However, the results suggest a simple iterative
scheme for ﬁnding a solution to the parameters estimation problem via
maximum likelihood. The expectation maximization algorithm (EM algo-

rithm) was proposed by Dempster et al. (1977) and is a general iterative
scheme for learning parameters (maximum likelihood or MAP) in mixture
models and, more generally, latent-variable models.
In our example of the Gaussian mixture model, we choose initial values
for µk, Σk, πk and alternate until convergence between
E-step: Evaluate the responsibilities rnk (posterior probability of data
point n belonging to mixture component k).
M-step: Use the updated responsibilities to reestimate the parameters
µk, Σk, πk.
Every step in the EM algorithm increases the log-likelihood function (Neal
and Hinton, 1999). For convergence, we can check the log-likelihood or
the parameters directly. A concrete instantiation of the EM algorithm for
estimating the parameters of a GMM is as follows:
1. Initialize µk, Σk, πk.
2. E-step: Evaluate responsibilities rnk for every data point xn using cur-
rent parameters πk, µk, Σk:

sponsibilities of the mixture components for the data points. The dataset is
colored according to the responsibilities of the mixture components when
EM converges. While a single mixture component is clearly responsible
for the data on the left, the overlap of the two data clusters on the right
could have been generated by two mixture components. It becomes clear
that there are data points that cannot be uniquely assigned to a single
component (either blue or yellow), such that the responsibilities of these
two clusters for those points are around 0.5.
11.4 Latent-Variable Perspective
We can look at the GMM from the perspective of a discrete latent-variable
model, i.e., where the latent variable z can attain only a ﬁnite set of val-
ues. This is in contrast to PCA, where the latent variables were continuous-
valued numbers in RM.
The advantages of the probabilistic perspective are that (i) it will jus-
tify some ad hoc decisions we made in the previous sections, (ii) it allows
for a concrete interpretation of the responsibilities as posterior probabil-
ities, and (iii) the iterative algorithm for updating the model parameters
can be derived in a principled manner as the EM algorithm for maximum
likelihood parameter estimation in latent-variable models.
11.4.1 Generative Process and Probabilistic Model
To derive the probabilistic model for GMMs, it is useful to think about the
generative process, i.e., the process that allows us to generate data, using
a probabilistic model.
We assume a mixture model with K components and that a data point
x can be generated by exactly one mixture component. We introduce a
binary indicator variable zk ∈{0, 1} with two states (see Section 6.2) that
indicates whether the kth mixture component generated that data point

(11.58)
We deﬁne z := [z1, . . . , zK]⊤∈RK as a probability vector consisting of
K −1 many 0s and exactly one 1. For example, for K = 3, a valid z would
be z = [z1, z2, z3]⊤= [0, 1, 0]⊤, which would select the second mixture
component since z2 = 1.
Remark. Sometimes this kind of probability distribution is called “multi-
noulli”, a generalization of the Bernoulli distribution to more than two
values (Murphy, 2012).
♦
The properties of z imply that PK
k=1 zk = 1. Therefore, z is a one-hot

Thus far, we assumed that the indicator variables zk are known. How-
ever, in practice, this is not the case, and we place a prior distribution

on the latent variable z. Then the kth entry

component generated data point x.

Remark (Sampling from a GMM). The construction of this latent-variable
model (see the corresponding graphical model in Figure 11.11) lends it-
self to a very simple sampling procedure (generative process) to generate
data:
1. Sample z(i) ∼p(z).
2. Sample x(i) ∼p(x | z(i) = 1).
In the ﬁrst step, we select a mixture component i (via the one-hot encod-
ing z) at random according to p(z) = π; in the second step we draw a
sample from the corresponding mixture component. When we discard the
samples of the latent variable so that we are left with the x(i), we have
valid samples from the GMM. This kind of sampling, where samples of
random variables depend on samples from the variable’s parents in the
graphical model, is called ancestral sampling.
♦
ancestral sampling
Generally, a probabilistic model is deﬁned by the joint distribution of
the data and the latent variables (see Section 8.4). With the prior p(z)
deﬁned in (11.59) and (11.60) and the conditional p(x | z) from (11.58),
we obtain all K components of this joint distribution via
p(x, zk = 1) = p(x | zk = 1)p(zk = 1) = πkN

11.4.2 Likelihood
To obtain the likelihood p(x | θ) in a latent-variable model, we need to
marginalize out the latent variables (see Section 8.4.3). In our case, this
can be done by summing out all latent variables from the joint p(x, z)
in (11.62) so that
p(x | θ) =
X
z
p(x | θ, z)p(z | θ) ,
θ := {µk, Σk, πk : k = 1, . . . , K} .
(11.63)
We now explicitly condition on the parameters θ of the probabilistic model,
which we previously omitted. In (11.63), we sum over all K possible one-
hot encodings of z, which is denoted by P
z. Since there is only a single
nonzero single entry in each z there are only K possible conﬁgurations/
settings of z. For example, if K = 3, then z can have the conﬁgurations

Summing over all possible conﬁgurations of z in (11.63) is equivalent to

which is exactly the GMM likelihood from (11.9). Therefore, the latent-

about a Gaussian mixture model.
11.4.3 Posterior Distribution
Let us have a brief look at the posterior distribution on the latent variable
z. According to Bayes’ theorem, the posterior of the kth component having
generated data point x
p(zk = 1 | x) = p(zk = 1)p(x | zk = 1)
p(x)
,
(11.68)
where the marginal p(x) is given in (11.66b). This yields the posterior
distribution for the kth indicator variable zk

(11.69)
which we identify as the responsibility of the kth mixture component for
data point x. Note that we omitted the explicit conditioning on the GMM
parameters πk, µk, Σk where k = 1, . . . , K.
11.4.4 Extension to a Full Dataset
Thus far, we have only discussed the case where the dataset consists only
of a single data point x. However, the concepts of the prior and posterior
can be directly extended to the case of N data points X := {x1, . . . , xN}.
In the probabilistic interpretation of the GMM, every data point xn pos-
sesses its own latent variable
zn = [zn1, . . . , znK]⊤∈RK .
(11.70)
Previously (when we only considered a single data point x), we omitted
the index n, but now this becomes important.

11.4 Latent-Variable Perspective
367
We share the same prior distribution π across all latent variables zn.
The corresponding graphical model is shown in Figure 11.12, where we
use the plate notation.
The conditional distribution p(x1, . . . , xN | z1, . . . , zN) factorizes over
the data points and is given as
p(x1, . . . , xN | z1, . . . , zN) =
N
Y
n=1
p(xn | zn) .
(11.71)
To obtain the posterior distribution p(znk = 1 | xn), we follow the same
reasoning as in Section 11.4.3 and apply Bayes’ theorem to obtain
p(znk = 1 | xn) =
p(xn | znk = 1)p(znk = 1)
PK
j=1 p(xn | znj = 1)p(znj = 1)
(11.72a)
=
πkN
 xn | µk, Σk

PK
j=1 πjN
 xn | µj, Σj
 = rnk .
(11.72b)
This means that p(zk = 1 | xn) is the (posterior) probability that the kth
mixture component generated data point xn and corresponds to the re-
sponsibility rnk we introduced in (11.17). Now the responsibilities also
have not only an intuitive but also a mathematically justiﬁed interpreta-
tion as posterior probabilities.
11.4.5 EM Algorithm Revisited
The EM algorithm that we introduced as an iterative scheme for maximum
likelihood estimation can be derived in a principled way from the latent-
variable perspective. Given a current setting θ(t) of model parameters, the
E-step calculates the expected log-likelihood
Q(θ | θ(t)) = Ez | x,θ(t)[log p(x, z | θ)]
(11.73a)
=
Z
log p(x, z | θ)p(z | x, θ(t))dz ,
(11.73b)
where the expectation of log p(x, z | θ) is taken with respect to the poste-
rior p(z | x, θ(t)) of the latent variables. The M-step selects an updated set
of model parameters θ(t+1) by maximizing (11.73b).
Although an EM iteration does increase the log-likelihood, there are
no guarantees that EM converges to the maximum likelihood solution.
It is possible that the EM algorithm converges to a local maximum of
the log-likelihood. Different initializations of the parameters θ could be
used in multiple EM runs to reduce the risk of ending up in a bad local
optimum. We do not go into further details here, but refer to the excellent
expositions by Rogers and Girolami (2016) and Bishop (2006).

Density Estimation with Gaussian Mixture Models
11.5 Further Reading
The GMM can be considered a generative model in the sense that it is
straightforward to generate new data using ancestral sampling (Bishop,
2006). For given GMM parameters πk, µk, Σk, k = 1, . . . , K, we sample
an index k from the probability vector [π1, . . . , πK]⊤and then sample a
data point x ∼N
 µk, Σk

. If we repeat this N times, we obtain a dataset
that has been generated by a GMM. Figure 11.1 was generated using this
procedure.
Throughout this chapter, we assumed that the number of components
K is known. In practice, this is often not the case. However, we could use
nested cross-validation, as discussed in Section 8.6.1, to ﬁnd good models.
Gaussian mixture models are closely related to the K-means clustering
algorithm. K-means also uses the EM algorithm to assign data points to
clusters. If we treat the means in the GMM as cluster centers and ignore
the covariances (or set them to I), we arrive at K-means. As also nicely
described by MacKay (2003), K-means makes a “hard” assignment of data
points to cluster centers µk, whereas a GMM makes a “soft” assignment
via the responsibilities.
We only touched upon the latent-variable perspective of GMMs and the
EM algorithm. Note that EM can be used for parameter learning in general
latent-variable models, e.g., nonlinear state-space models (Ghahramani
and Roweis, 1999; Roweis and Ghahramani, 1999) and for reinforcement
learning as discussed by Barber (2012). Therefore, the latent-variable per-
spective of a GMM is useful to derive the corresponding EM algorithm in
a principled way (Bishop, 2006; Barber, 2012; Murphy, 2012).
We only discussed maximum likelihood estimation (via the EM algo-
rithm) for ﬁnding GMM parameters. The standard criticisms of maximum
likelihood also apply here:
As in linear regression, maximum likelihood can suffer from severe
overﬁtting. In the GMM case, this happens when the mean of a mix-
ture component is identical to a data point and the covariance tends to
0. Then, the likelihood approaches inﬁnity. Bishop (2006) and Barber
(2012) discuss this issue in detail.
We only obtain a point estimate of the parameters πk, µk, Σk for k =
1, . . . , K, which does not give any indication of uncertainty in the pa-
rameter values. A Bayesian approach would place a prior on the param-
eters, which can be used to obtain a posterior distribution on the param-
eters. This posterior allows us to compute the model evidence (marginal
likelihood), which can be used for model comparison, which gives us a
principled way to determine the number of mixture components. Un-
fortunately, closed-form inference is not possible in this setting because
there is no conjugate prior for this model. However, approximations,
such as variational inference, can be used to obtain an approximate
posterior (Bishop, 2006).

Histogram
In this chapter, we discussed mixture models for density estimation.
There is a plethora of density estimation techniques available. In practice,
we often use histograms and kernel density estimation.
histogram
Histograms provide a nonparametric way to represent continuous den-
sities and have been proposed by Pearson (1895). A histogram is con-
structed by “binning” the data space and count, how many data points fall
into each bin. Then a bar is drawn at the center of each bin, and the height
of the bar is proportional to the number of data points within that bin. The
bin size is a critical hyperparameter, and a bad choice can lead to overﬁt-
ting and underﬁtting. Cross-validation, as discussed in Section 8.2.4, can
be used to determine a good bin size.
kernel density
estimation
Kernel density estimation, independently proposed by Rosenblatt (1956)
and Parzen (1962), is a nonparametric way for density estimation. Given
N i.i.d. samples, the kernel density estimator represents the underlying
distribution as

where k is a kernel function, i.e., a nonnegative function that integrates to
1 and h > 0 is a smoothing/bandwidth parameter, which plays a similar
role as the bin size in histograms. Note that we place a kernel on every
single data point xn in the dataset. Commonly used kernel functions are
the uniform distribution and the Gaussian distribution. Kernel density esti-
mates are closely related to histograms, but by choosing a suitable kernel,
we can guarantee smoothness of the density estimate. Figure 11.13 illus-
trates the difference between a histogram and a kernel density estimator
(with a Gaussian-shaped kernel) for a given dataset of 250 data points.

Classiﬁcation with Support Vector Machines
In many situations, we want our machine learning algorithm to predict
one of a number of (discrete) outcomes. For example, an email client sorts
mail into personal mail and junk mail, which has two outcomes. Another
example is a telescope that identiﬁes whether an object in the night sky
is a galaxy, star, or planet. There are usually a small number of outcomes,
and more importantly there is usually no additional structure on these
outcomes. In this chapter, we consider predictors that output binary val-

is called binary classiﬁcation. This is in contrast to Chapter 9, where we

we defer a survey of other approaches to Section 12.6.
We present an approach known as the support vector machine (SVM),
which solves the binary classiﬁcation task. As in regression, we have a su-
pervised learning task, where we have a set of examples xn ∈RD along
with their corresponding (binary) labels yn ∈{+1, −1}. Given a train-
ing data set consisting of example–label pairs {(x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN)}, we
would like to estimate parameters of the model that will give the smallest
classiﬁcation error. Similar to Chapter 9, we consider a linear model, and
hide away the nonlinearity in a transformation φ of the examples (9.13).
We will revisit φ in Section 12.4.
The SVM provides state-of-the-art results in many applications, with
sound theoretical guarantees (Steinwart and Christmann, 2008). There
are two main reasons why we chose to illustrate binary classiﬁcation using

SVMs. First, the SVM allows for a geometric way to think about supervised
machine learning. While in Chapter 9 we considered the machine learning
problem in terms of probabilistic models and attacked it using maximum
likelihood estimation and Bayesian inference, here we will consider an
alternative approach where we reason geometrically about the machine
learning task. It relies heavily on concepts, such as inner products and
projections, which we discussed in Chapter 3. The second reason why we
ﬁnd SVMs instructive is that in contrast to Chapter 9, the optimization
problem for SVM does not admit an analytic solution so that we need to
resort to a variety of optimization tools introduced in Chapter 7.
The SVM view of machine learning is subtly different from the max-
imum likelihood view of Chapter 9. The maximum likelihood view pro-
poses a model based on a probabilistic view of the data distribution, from
which an optimization problem is derived. In contrast, the SVM view starts
by designing a particular function that is to be optimized during training,
based on geometric intuitions. We have seen something similar already
in Chapter 10, where we derived PCA from geometric principles. In the
SVM case, we start by designing a loss function that is to be minimized
on training data, following the principles of empirical risk minimization
(Section 8.2).
Let us derive the optimization problem corresponding to training an
SVM on example–label pairs. Intuitively, we imagine binary classiﬁcation
data, which can be separated by a hyperplane as illustrated in Figure 12.1.
Here, every example xn (a vector of dimension 2) is a two-dimensional
location (x(1)
n
and x(2)
n ), and the corresponding binary label yn is one of
two different symbols (orange cross or blue disc). “Hyperplane” is a word
that is commonly used in machine learning, and we encountered hyper-
planes already in Section 2.8. A hyperplane is an afﬁne subspace of di-
mension D −1 (if the corresponding vector space is of dimension D).
The examples consist of two classes (there are two possible labels) that
have features (the components of the vector representing the example)
arranged in such a way as to allow us to separate/classify them by draw-
ing a straight line.

Classiﬁcation with Support Vector Machines
In the following, we formalize the idea of ﬁnding a linear separator
of the two classes. We introduce the idea of the margin and then extend
linear separators to allow for examples to fall on the “wrong” side, incur-
ring a classiﬁcation error. We present two equivalent ways of formalizing
the SVM: the geometric view (Section 12.2.4) and the loss function view
(Section 12.2.5). We derive the dual version of the SVM using Lagrange
multipliers (Section 7.2). The dual SVM allows us to observe a third way
of formalizing the SVM: in terms of the convex hulls of the examples of
each class (Section 12.3.2). We conclude by brieﬂy describing kernels and
how to numerically solve the nonlinear kernel-SVM optimization problem.
12.1 Separating Hyperplanes
Given two examples represented as vectors xi and xj, one way to compute
the similarity between them is using an inner product ⟨xi, xj⟩. Recall from
Section 3.2 that inner products are closely related to the angle between
two vectors. The value of the inner product between two vectors depends
on the length (norm) of each vector. Furthermore, inner products allow
us to rigorously deﬁne geometric concepts such as orthogonality and pro-
jections.
The main idea behind many classiﬁcation algorithms is to represent
data in RD and then partition this space, ideally in a way that examples
with the same label (and no other examples) are in the same partition.
In the case of binary classiﬁcation, the space would be divided into two
parts corresponding to the positive and negative classes, respectively. We
consider a particularly convenient partition, which is to (linearly) split
the space into two halves using a hyperplane. Let example x ∈RD be an
element of the data space. Consider a function
f : RD →R
(12.2a)
x 7→f(x) := ⟨w, x⟩+ b ,
(12.2b)
parametrized by w ∈RD and b ∈R. Recall from Section 2.8 that hy-
perplanes are afﬁne subspaces. Therefore, we deﬁne the hyperplane that
separates the two classes in our binary classiﬁcation problem as
x ∈RD : f(x) = 0
	 .
(12.3)
An illustration of the hyperplane is shown in Figure 12.2, where the
vector w is a vector normal to the hyperplane and b the intercept. We can
derive that w is a normal vector to the hyperplane in (12.3) by choosing
any two examples xa and xb on the hyperplane and showing that the
vector between them is orthogonal to w. In the form of an equation,
f(xa) −f(xb) = ⟨w, xa⟩+ b −(⟨w, xb⟩+ b)

where the second line is obtained by the linearity of the inner product

this implies that f(xa) = 0 and f(xb) = 0 and hence ⟨w, xa −xb⟩= 0.
Recall that two vectors are orthogonal when their inner product is zero.
w is orthogonal to
any vector on the
hyperplane.
Therefore, we obtain that w is orthogonal to any vector on the hyperplane.
Remark. Recall from Chapter 2 that we can think of vectors in different
ways. In this chapter, we think of the parameter vector w as an arrow
indicating a direction, i.e., we consider w to be a geometric vector. In
contrast, we think of the example vector x as a data point (as indicated
by its coordinates), i.e., we consider x to be the coordinates of a vector
with respect to the standard basis.
♦
When presented with a test example, we classify the example as pos-
itive or negative depending on the side of the hyperplane on which it
occurs. Note that (12.3) not only deﬁnes a hyperplane; it additionally de-
ﬁnes a direction. In other words, it deﬁnes the positive and negative side
of the hyperplane. Therefore, to classify a test example xtest, we calcu-
late the value of the function f(xtest) and classify the example as +1 if
f(xtest) ⩾0 and −1 otherwise. Thinking geometrically, the positive ex-
amples lie “above” the hyperplane and the negative examples “below” the
hyperplane.
When training the classiﬁer, we want to ensure that the examples with
positive labels are on the positive side of the hyperplane, i.e.,
⟨w, xn⟩+ b ⩾0
when
yn = +1
(12.5)
and the examples with negative labels are on the negative side, i.e.,

examples. These two conditions are often presented in a single equation

Equation (12.7) is equivalent to (12.5) and (12.6) when we multiply both
sides of (12.5) and (12.6) with yn = 1 and yn = −1, respectively.

12.2 Primal Support Vector Machine
Based on the concept of distances from points to a hyperplane, we now
are in a position to discuss the support vector machine. For a dataset
{(x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN)} that is linearly separable, we have inﬁnitely many
candidate hyperplanes (refer to Figure 12.3), and therefore classiﬁers,
that solve our classiﬁcation problem without any (training) errors. To ﬁnd
a unique solution, one idea is to choose the separating hyperplane that
maximizes the margin between the positive and negative examples. In
other words, we want the positive and negative examples to be separated
by a large margin (Section 12.2.1). In the following, we compute the dis-

tance between an example and a hyperplane to derive the margin. Recall
that the closest point on the hyperplane to a given point (example xn) is
obtained by the orthogonal projection (Section 3.8).
12.2.1 Concept of the Margin
The concept of the margin is intuitively simple: It is the distance of the

that the dataset is linearly separable. However, when trying to formalize
this distance, there is a technical wrinkle that may be confusing. The tech-
nical wrinkle is that we need to deﬁne a scale at which to measure the
distance. A potential scale is to consider the scale of the data, i.e., the raw
values of xn. There are problems with this, as we could change the units
of measurement of xn and change the values in xn, and, hence, change
the distance to the hyperplane. As we will see shortly, we deﬁne the scale
based on the equation of the hyperplane (12.3) itself.
Consider a hyperplane ⟨w, x⟩+ b, and an example xa as illustrated in
Figure 12.4. Without loss of generality, we can consider the example xa
to be on the positive side of the hyperplane, i.e., ⟨w, xa⟩+ b > 0. We
would like to compute the distance r > 0 of xa from the hyperplane. We
do so by considering the orthogonal projection (Section 3.8) of xa onto
the hyperplane, which we denote by x′
a. Since w is orthogonal to the

hyperplane, we know that the distance r is just a scaling of this vector w.
If the length of w is known, then we can use this scaling factor r factor
to work out the absolute distance between xa and x′
a. For convenience,
we choose to use a vector of unit length (its norm is 1) and obtain this
by dividing w by its norm,
w
∥w∥. Using vector addition (Section 2.4), we
obtain
xa = x′
a + r w
∥w∥.
(12.8)
Another way of thinking about r is that it is the coordinate of xa in the
subspace spanned by w/ ∥w∥. We have now expressed the distance of xa
from the hyperplane as r, and if we choose xa to be the point closest to
the hyperplane, this distance r is the margin.
Recall that we would like the positive examples to be further than r
from the hyperplane, and the negative examples to be further than dis-
tance r (in the negative direction) from the hyperplane. Analogously to
the combination of (12.5) and (12.6) into (12.7), we formulate this ob-
jective as
yn(⟨w, xn⟩+ b) ⩾r .
(12.9)
In other words, we combine the requirements that examples are at least
r away from the hyperplane (in the positive and negative direction) into
one single inequality.
Since we are interested only in the direction, we add an assumption to
our model that the parameter vector w is of unit length, i.e., ∥w∥= 1,
where we use the Euclidean norm ∥w∥=

w⊤w (Section 3.1). This

products

Section 12.4.
assumption also allows a more intuitive interpretation of the distance r
(12.8) since it is the scaling factor of a vector of length 1.
Remark. A reader familiar with other presentations of the margin would
notice that our deﬁnition of ∥w∥= 1 is different from the standard
presentation if the SVM was the one provided by Sch¨olkopf and Smola
(2002), for example. In Section 12.2.3, we will show the equivalence of
both approaches.

which says that we want to maximize the margin r while ensuring that

Remark. The concept of the margin turns out to be highly pervasive in ma-
chine learning. It was used by Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis
to show that when the margin is large, the “complexity” of the function
class is low, and hence learning is possible (Vapnik, 2000). It turns out
that the concept is useful for various different approaches for theoret-
ically analyzing generalization error (Steinwart and Christmann, 2008;
Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014).
♦
12.2.2 Traditional Derivation of the Margin
In the previous section, we derived (12.10) by making the observation that
we are only interested in the direction of w and not its length, leading to
the assumption that ∥w∥= 1. In this section, we derive the margin max-
imization problem by making a different assumption. Instead of choosing
that the parameter vector is normalized, we choose a scale for the data.
We choose this scale such that the value of the predictor ⟨w, x⟩+ b is 1 at
the closest example. Let us also denote the example in the dataset that is

Figure 12.5 is identical to Figure 12.4, except that now we rescaled the
axes, such that the example xa lies exactly on the margin, i.e., ⟨w, xa⟩+
b = 1. Since x′
a is the orthogonal projection of xa onto the hyperplane, it
must by deﬁnition lie on the hyperplane, i.e.,
⟨w, x′
a⟩+ b = 0 .

seem to have derived the distance from the hyperplane in terms of the
length of the vector w, but we do not yet know this vector. One way to
think about it is to consider the distance r to be a temporary variable
that we only use for this derivation. Therefore, for the rest of this section
we will denote the distance to the hyperplane by

∥w∥. In Section 12.2.3,
we will see that the choice that the margin equals 1 is equivalent to our
previous assumption of ∥w∥= 1 in Section 12.2.1.

negative examples to be at least 1 away from the hyperplane, which yields
the condition

not linearly separable.
12.2.3 Why We Can Set the Margin to 1
In Section 12.2.1, we argued that we would like to maximize some value
r, which represents the distance of the closest example to the hyperplane.
In Section 12.2.2, we scaled the data such that the closest example is of
distance 1 to the hyperplane. In this section, we relate the two derivations,
and show that they are equivalent.

Proof
Consider (12.20). Since the square is a strictly monotonic trans-
formation for non-negative arguments, the maximum stays the same if we
consider r2 in the objective. Since ∥w∥= 1 we can reparametrize the

12.2.4 Soft Margin SVM: Geometric View
In the case where data is not linearly separable, we may wish to allow
some examples to fall within the margin region, or even to be on the
wrong side of the hyperplane as illustrated in Figure 12.6.
The model that allows for some classiﬁcation errors is called the soft
soft margin SVM
margin SVM. In this section, we derive the resulting optimization problem
using geometric arguments. In Section 12.2.5, we will derive an equiv-
alent optimization problem using the idea of a loss function. Using La-
grange multipliers (Section 7.2), we will derive the dual optimization
problem of the SVM in Section 12.3. This dual optimization problem al-
lows us to observe a third interpretation of the SVM: as a hyperplane that
bisects the line between convex hulls corresponding to the positive and
negative data examples (Section 12.3.2).
The key geometric idea is to introduce a slack variable ξn corresponding
slack variable
to each example–label pair (xn, yn) that allows a particular example to be
within the margin or even on the wrong side of the hyperplane (refer to

C > 0 trades off the size of the margin and the total amount of slack that
we have. This parameter is called the regularization parameter since, as

parameter
we will see in the following section, the margin term in the objective func-
tion (12.26a) is a regularization term. The margin term ∥w∥2 is called
the regularizer, and in many books on numerical optimization, the reg-
regularizer
ularization parameter is multiplied with this term (Section 8.2.3). This
is in contrast to our formulation in this section. Here a large value of C
implies low regularization, as we give the slack variables larger weight,
hence giving more priority to examples that do not lie on the correct side
of the margin.
There are
alternative
parametrizations of
this regularization,
which is
why (12.26a) is also
often referred to as
the C-SVM.
Remark. In the formulation of the soft margin SVM (12.26a) w is reg-
ularized, but b is not regularized. We can see this by observing that the
regularization term does not contain b. The unregularized term b com-
plicates theoretical analysis (Steinwart and Christmann, 2008, chapter 1)
and decreases computational efﬁciency (Fan et al., 2008).

12.2.5 Soft Margin SVM: Loss Function View
Let us consider a different approach for deriving the SVM, following the
principle of empirical risk minimization (Section 8.2). For the SVM, we

choose hyperplanes as the hypothesis class, that is
f(x) = ⟨w, x⟩+ b.
(12.27)
We will see in this section that the margin corresponds to the regulariza-
tion term. The remaining question is, what is the loss function? In con-
loss function
trast to Chapter 9, where we consider regression problems (the output
of the predictor is a real number), in this chapter, we consider binary
classiﬁcation problems (the output of the predictor is one of two labels
{+1, −1}). Therefore, the error/loss function for each single example–
label pair needs to be appropriate for binary classiﬁcation. For example,
the squared loss that is used for regression (9.10b) is not suitable for bi-
nary classiﬁcation.
Remark. The ideal loss function between binary labels is to count the num-
ber of mismatches between the prediction and the label. This means that
for a predictor f applied to an example xn, we compare the output f(xn)
with the label yn. We deﬁne the loss to be zero if they match, and one if
they do not match. This is denoted by 1(f(xn) ̸= yn) and is called the
zero-one loss. Unfortunately, the zero-one loss results in a combinatorial
zero-one loss
optimization problem for ﬁnding the best parameters w, b. Combinatorial
optimization problems (in contrast to continuous optimization problems
discussed in Chapter 7) are in general more challenging to solve.
♦
What is the loss function corresponding to the SVM? Consider the error
between the output of a predictor f(xn) and the label yn. The loss de-
scribes the error that is made on the training data. An equivalent way to
derive (12.26a) is to use the hinge loss
hinge loss
ℓ(t) = max{0, 1 −t}
where
t = yf(x) = y(⟨w, x⟩+ b) .
(12.28)
If f(x) is on the correct side (based on the corresponding label y) of the
hyperplane, and further than distance 1, this means that t ⩾1 and the
hinge loss returns a value of zero. If f(x) is on the correct side but too
close to the hyperplane (0 < t < 1), the example x is within the margin,
and the hinge loss returns a positive value. When the example is on the
wrong side of the hyperplane (t < 0), the hinge loss returns an even larger
value, which increases linearly. In other words, we pay a penalty once we
are closer than the margin to the hyperplane, even if the prediction is
correct, and the penalty increases linearly. An alternative way to express
the hinge loss is by considering it as two linear pieces
ℓ(t) =

In principle, the unconstrained optimization problem in (12.31) can
be directly solved with (sub-)gradient descent methods as described in
Section 7.1. To see that (12.31) and (12.26a) are equivalent, observe that
the hinge loss (12.28) essentially consists of two linear parts, as expressed
in (12.29). Consider the hinge loss for a single example-label pair (12.28).
We can equivalently replace minimization of the hinge loss over t with a
minimization of a slack variable ξ with two constraints. In equation form,

By substituting this expression into (12.31) and rearranging one of the

Remark. Let us contrast our choice of the loss function in this section to the
loss function for linear regression in Chapter 9. Recall from Section 9.2.1
that for ﬁnding maximum likelihood estimators, we usually minimize the

regression with Gaussian noise is Gaussian, the negative log-likelihood for
each example is a squared error function. The squared error function is the
loss function that is minimized when looking for the maximum likelihood
solution.
♦
12.3 Dual Support Vector Machine
The description of the SVM in the previous sections, in terms of the vari-
ables w and b, is known as the primal SVM. Recall that we consider inputs
x ∈RD with D features. Since w is of the same dimension as x, this
means that the number of parameters (the dimension of w) of the opti-
mization problem grows linearly with the number of features.
In the following, we consider an equivalent optimization problem (the
so-called dual view), which is independent of the number of features. In-
stead, the number of parameters increases with the number of examples
in the training set. We saw a similar idea appear in Chapter 10, where we
expressed the learning problem in a way that does not scale with the num-
ber of features. This is useful for problems where we have more features
than the number of examples in the training dataset. The dual SVM also
has the additional advantage that it easily allows kernels to be applied,
as we shall see at the end of this chapter. The word “dual” appears often
in mathematical literature, and in this particular case it refers to convex
duality. The following subsections are essentially an application of convex
duality, which we discussed in Section 7.2.
12.3.1 Convex Duality via Lagrange Multipliers
Recall the primal soft margin SVM (12.26a). We call the variables w, b,
and ξ corresponding to the primal SVM the primal variables. We use αn ⩾

the examples are classiﬁed correctly and γn ⩾0 as the Lagrange multi-
plier corresponding to the non-negativity constraint of the slack variable;

the primal is a linear combination of the examples xn. Recall from Sec-
tion 2.6.1 that this means that the solution of the optimization problem
lies in the span of training data. Additionally, the constraint obtained by
setting (12.36) to zero implies that the optimal weight vector is an afﬁne
combination of the examples. The representer theorem turns out to hold
for very general settings of regularized empirical risk minimization (Hof-
mann et al., 2008; Argyriou and Dinuzzo, 2014). The theorem has more
general versions (Sch¨olkopf et al., 2001), and necessary and sufﬁcient
conditions on its existence can be found in Yu et al. (2013).
Remark. The representer theorem (12.38) also provides an explanation
of the name “support vector machine.” The examples xn, for which the
corresponding parameters αn = 0, do not contribute to the solution w at
all. The other examples, where αn > 0, are called support vectors since

The last term in this equation is a collection of all terms that contain slack

is also zero. Furthermore, by using the same equation and recalling that
the Lagrange multiplers γi are non-negative, we conclude that αi ⩽C.
We now obtain the dual optimization problem of the SVM, which is ex-
pressed exclusively in terms of the Lagrange multipliers αi. Recall from
Lagrangian duality (Deﬁnition 7.1) that we maximize the dual problem.
This is equivalent to minimizing the negative dual problem, such that we

The equality constraint in (12.41) is obtained from setting (12.36) to
zero. The inequality constraint αi ⩾0 is the condition imposed on La-
grange multipliers of inequality constraints (Section 7.2). The inequality
constraint αi ⩽C is discussed in the previous paragraph.
The set of inequality constraints in the SVM are called “box constraints”
because they limit the vector α = [α1, · · · , αN]⊤∈RN of Lagrange mul-
tipliers to be inside the box deﬁned by 0 and C on each axis. These
axis-aligned boxes are particularly efﬁcient to implement in numerical
solvers (Dost´al, 2009, chapter 5).
It turns out that
examples that lie

examples whose
dual parameters lie
strictly inside the
box constraints,
0 < αi < C. This is
derived using the

Once we obtain the dual parameters α, we can recover the primal pa-
rameters w by using the representer theorem (12.38). Let us call the op-
timal primal parameter w∗. However, there remains the question on how
to obtain the parameter b∗. Consider an example xn that lies exactly on
the margin’s boundary, i.e., ⟨w∗, xn⟩+ b = yn. Recall that yn is either +1
or −1. Therefore, the only unknown is b, which can be computed by
b∗= yn −⟨w∗, xn⟩.

Remark. In principle, there may be no examples that lie exactly on the
margin. In this case, we should compute |yn −⟨w∗, xn⟩| for all support
vectors and take the median value of this absolute value difference to be

12.3.2 Dual SVM: Convex Hull View
Another approach to obtain the dual SVM is to consider an alternative
geometric argument. Consider the set of examples xn with the same label.
We would like to build a convex set that contains all the examples such
that it is the smallest possible set. This is called the convex hull and is
illustrated in Figure 12.9.
Let us ﬁrst build some intuition about a convex combination of points.
Consider two points x1 and x2 and corresponding non-negative weights
α1, α2 ⩾0 such that α1+α2 = 1. The equation α1x1+α2x2 describes each
point on a line between x1 and x2. Consider what happens when we add
a third point x3 along with a weight α3 ⩾0 such that P3
n=1 αn = 1.
The convex combination of these three points x1, x2, x3 spans a two-
dimensional area. The convex hull of this area is the triangle formed by
convex hull
the edges corresponding to each pair of of points. As we add more points,
and the number of points becomes greater than the number of dimen-
sions, some of the points will be inside the convex hull, as we can see in
Figure 12.9(a).
In general, building a convex convex hull can be done by introducing
non-negative weights αn ⩾0 corresponding to each example xn. Then
the convex hull can be described as the set

for all n = 1, . . . , N. If the two clouds of points corresponding to the
positive and negative classes are separated, then the convex hulls do not
overlap. Given the training data (x1, y1), . . . , (xN, yN), we form two con-
vex hulls, corresponding to the positive and negative classes respectively.
We pick a point c, which is in the convex hull of the set of positive exam-
ples, and is closest to the negative class distribution. Similarly, we pick a
point d in the convex hull of the set of negative examples and is closest to
the positive class distribution; see Figure 12.9(b). We deﬁne a difference
vector between d and c as
w := c −d .
(12.44)
Picking the points c and d as in the preceding cases, and requiring them
to be closest to each other is equivalent to minimizing the length/norm of
w, so that we end up with the corresponding optimization problem

The objective function (12.48) and the constraint (12.50), along with the
assumption that α ⩾0, give us a constrained (convex) optimization prob-
lem. This optimization problem can be shown to be the same as that of
the dual hard margin SVM (Bennett and Bredensteiner, 2000a).
Remark. To obtain the soft margin dual, we consider the reduced hull. The
reduced hull is similar to the convex hull but has an upper bound to the
reduced hull
size of the coefﬁcients α. The maximum possible value of the elements
of α restricts the size that the convex hull can take. In other words, the
bound on α shrinks the convex hull to a smaller volume (Bennett and
Bredensteiner, 2000b).
♦
12.4 Kernels
Consider the formulation of the dual SVM (12.41). Notice that the in-
ner product in the objective occurs only between examples xi and xj.
There are no inner products between the examples and the parameters.
Therefore, if we consider a set of features φ(xi) to represent xi, the only
change in the dual SVM will be to replace the inner product. This mod-
ularity, where the choice of the classiﬁcation method (the SVM) and the
choice of the feature representation φ(x) can be considered separately,
provides ﬂexibility for us to explore the two problems independently. In
this section, we discuss the representation φ(x) and brieﬂy introduce the
idea of kernels, but do not go into the technical details.
Since φ(x) could be a non-linear function, we can use the SVM (which
assumes a linear classiﬁer) to construct classiﬁers that are nonlinear in
the examples xn. This provides a second avenue, in addition to the soft
margin, for users to deal with a dataset that is not linearly separable. It
turns out that there are many algorithms and statistical methods that have
this property that we observed in the dual SVM: the only inner products
are those that occur between examples. Instead of explicitly deﬁning a
non-linear feature map φ(·) and computing the resulting inner product
between examples xi and xj, we deﬁne a similarity function k(xi, xj) be-
tween xi and xj. For a certain class of similarity functions, called kernels,
kernel
the similarity function implicitly deﬁnes a non-linear feature map φ(·).

and Williams, 2006). Figure 12.10 illustrates the effect of different kernels
on separating hyperplanes on an example dataset. Note that we are still
solving for hyperplanes, that is, the hypothesis class of functions are still
linear. The non-linear surfaces are due to the kernel function.
Remark. Unfortunately for the ﬂedgling machine learner, there are mul-
tiple meanings of the word “kernel.” In this chapter, the word “kernel”
comes from the idea of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) (Aron-
szajn, 1950; Saitoh, 1988). We have discussed the idea of the kernel in lin-
ear algebra (Section 2.7.3), where the kernel is another word for the null
space. The third common use of the word “kernel” in machine learning is
the smoothing kernel in kernel density estimation (Section 11.5).
♦
Since the explicit representation φ(x) is mathematically equivalent to
the kernel representation k(xi, xj), a practitioner will often design the
kernel function such that it can be computed more efﬁciently than the
inner product between explicit feature maps. For example, consider the
polynomial kernel (Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2002), where the number of
terms in the explicit expansion grows very quickly (even for polynomials
of low degree) when the input dimension is large. The kernel function
only requires one multiplication per input dimension, which can provide
signiﬁcant computational savings. Another example is the Gaussian ra-
dial basis function kernel (Sch¨olkopf and Smola, 2002; Rasmussen and
Williams, 2006), where the corresponding feature space is inﬁnite dimen-
sional. In this case, we cannot explicitly represent the feature space but
can still compute similarities between a pair of examples using the kernel.
The choice of
kernel, as well as
the parameters of
the kernel, is often
chosen using nested
cross-validation
(Section 8.6.1).
Another useful aspect of the kernel trick is that there is no need for
the original data to be already represented as multivariate real-valued
data. Note that the inner product is deﬁned on the output of the function
φ(·), but does not restrict the input to real numbers. Hence, the function
φ(·) and the kernel function k(·, ·) can be deﬁned on any object, e.g.,
sets, sequences, strings, graphs, and distributions (Ben-Hur et al., 2008;
G¨artner, 2008; Shi et al., 2009; Sriperumbudur et al., 2010; Vishwanathan
et al., 2010).
12.5 Numerical Solution
We conclude our discussion of SVMs by looking at how to express the
problems derived in this chapter in terms of the concepts presented in
Chapter 7. We consider two different approaches for ﬁnding the optimal
solution for the SVM. First we consider the loss view of SVM 8.2.2 and ex-
press this as an unconstrained optimization problem. Then we express the
constrained versions of the primal and dual SVMs as quadratic programs
in standard form 7.3.2.
Consider the loss function view of the SVM (12.31). This is a convex
unconstrained optimization problem, but the hinge loss (12.28) is not dif-

ferentiable. Therefore, we apply a subgradient approach for solving it.
However, the hinge loss is differentiable almost everywhere, except for
one single point at the hinge t = 1. At this point, the gradient is a set of
possible values that lie between 0 and −1. Therefore, the subgradient g of
the hinge loss is given by
g(t) =





−1
t < 1
[−1, 0]
t = 1
0
t > 1
.
(12.54)
Using this subgradient, we can apply the optimization methods presented
in Section 7.1.
Both the primal and the dual SVM result in a convex quadratic pro-
gramming problem (constrained optimization). Note that the primal SVM
in (12.26a) has optimization variables that have the size of the dimen-
sion D of the input examples. The dual SVM in (12.41) has optimization
variables that have the size of the number N of examples.
To express the primal SVM in the standard form (7.45) for quadratic
programming, let us assume that we use the dot product (3.5) as the
inner product. We rearrange the equation for the primal SVM (12.26a),

Section 3.2 that we

such that the optimization variables are all on the right and the inequality
of the constraint matches the standard form. This yields the optimization

In the preceding optimization problem, the minimization is over the pa-
rameters [w⊤, b, ξ⊤]⊤∈RD+1+N, and we use the notation: Im to rep-
resent the identity matrix of size m × m, 0m,n to represent the matrix
of zeros of size m × n, and 1m,n to represent the matrix of ones of size
m × n. In addition, y is the vector of labels [y1, · · · , yN]⊤, Y = diag(y)

is an N by N matrix where the elements of the diagonal are from y, and
X ∈RN×D is the matrix obtained by concatenating all the examples.
We can similarly perform a collection of terms for the dual version of the
SVM (12.41). To express the dual SVM in standard form, we ﬁrst have to
express the kernel matrix K such that each entry is Kij = k(xi, xj). If we
have an explicit feature representation xi then we deﬁne Kij = ⟨xi, xj⟩.
For convenience of notation we introduce a matrix with zeros everywhere
except on the diagonal, where we store the labels, that is, Y = diag(y).

(12.57)
Remark. In Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.2, we introduced the standard forms
of the constraints to be inequality constraints. We will express the dual
SVM’s equality constraint as two inequality constraints, i.e.,
Ax = b
is replaced by
Ax ⩽b
and
Ax ⩾b .
(12.58)
Particular software implementations of convex optimization methods may
provide the ability to express equality constraints.
♦
Since there are many different possible views of the SVM, there are
many approaches for solving the resulting optimization problem. The ap-
proach presented here, expressing the SVM problem in standard convex
optimization form, is not often used in practice. The two main implemen-
tations of SVM solvers are Chang and Lin (2011) (which is open source)
and Joachims (1999). Since SVMs have a clear and well-deﬁned optimiza-
tion problem, many approaches based on numerical optimization tech-
niques (Nocedal and Wright, 2006) can be applied (Shawe-Taylor and
Sun, 2011).
12.6 Further Reading
The SVM is one of many approaches for studying binary classiﬁcation.
Other approaches include the perceptron, logistic regression, Fisher dis-
criminant, nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and random forest (Bishop, 2006;
Murphy, 2012). A short tutorial on SVMs and kernels on discrete se-
quences can be found in Ben-Hur et al. (2008). The development of SVMs
is closely linked to empirical risk minimization, discussed in Section 8.2.
Hence, the SVM has strong theoretical properties (Vapnik, 2000; Stein-
wart and Christmann, 2008). The book about kernel methods (Sch¨olkopf
and Smola, 2002) includes many details of support vector machines and

how to optimize them. A broader book about kernel methods (Shawe-
Taylor and Cristianini, 2004) also includes many linear algebra approaches
for different machine learning problems.
An alternative derivation of the dual SVM can be obtained using the
idea of the Legendre–Fenchel transform (Section 7.3.3). The derivation
considers each term of the unconstrained formulation of the SVM (12.31)
separately and calculates their convex conjugates (Rifkin and Lippert,
2007). Readers interested in the functional analysis view (also the reg-
ularization methods view) of SVMs are referred to the work by Wahba
(1990). Theoretical exposition of kernels (Aronszajn, 1950; Schwartz,
1964; Saitoh, 1988; Manton and Amblard, 2015) requires a basic ground-
ing in linear operators (Akhiezer and Glazman, 1993). The idea of kernels
have been generalized to Banach spaces (Zhang et al., 2009) and Kre˘ın
spaces (Ong et al., 2004; Loosli et al., 2016).
Observe that the hinge loss has three equivalent representations, as
shown in (12.28) and (12.29), as well as the constrained optimization
problem in (12.33). The formulation (12.28) is often used when compar-
ing the SVM loss function with other loss functions (Steinwart, 2007).
The two-piece formulation (12.29) is convenient for computing subgra-
dients, as each piece is linear. The third formulation (12.33), as seen
in Section 12.5, enables the use of convex quadratic programming (Sec-
tion 7.3.2) tools.
Since binary classiﬁcation is a well-studied task in machine learning,
other words are also sometimes used, such as discrimination, separation,
and decision. Furthermore, there are three quantities that can be the out-
put of a binary classiﬁer. First is the output of the linear function itself
(often called the score), which can take any real value. This output can be
used for ranking the examples, and binary classiﬁcation can be thought
of as picking a threshold on the ranked examples (Shawe-Taylor and Cris-
tianini, 2004). The second quantity that is often considered the output
of a binary classiﬁer is the output determined after it is passed through
a non-linear function to constrain its value to a bounded range, for ex-
ample in the interval [0, 1]. A common non-linear function is the sigmoid
function (Bishop, 2006). When the non-linearity results in well-calibrated
probabilities (Gneiting and Raftery, 2007; Reid and Williamson, 2011),
this is called class probability estimation. The third output of a binary
classiﬁer is the ﬁnal binary decision {+1, −1}, which is the one most com-
monly assumed to be the output of the classiﬁer.
The SVM is a binary classiﬁer that does not naturally lend itself to a
probabilistic interpretation. There are several approaches for converting
the raw output of the linear function (the score) into a calibrated class
probability estimate (P(Y = 1|X = x)) that involve an additional cal-
ibration step (Platt, 2000; Zadrozny and Elkan, 2001; Lin et al., 2007).
From the training perspective, there are many related probabilistic ap-
proaches. We mentioned at the end of Section 12.2.5 that there is a re-
c⃝2021 M. P. Deisenroth, A. A. Faisal, C. S. Ong. Published by Cambridge University Press (2020).

Classiﬁcation with Support Vector Machines
lationship between loss function and the likelihood (also compare Sec-
tions 8.2 and 8.3). The maximum likelihood approach corresponding to
a well-calibrated transformation during training is called logistic regres-
sion, which comes from a class of methods called generalized linear mod-
els. Details of logistic regression from this point of view can be found in
Agresti (2002, chapter 5) and McCullagh and Nelder (1989, chapter 4).
Naturally, one could take a more Bayesian view of the classiﬁer output by
estimating a posterior distribution using Bayesian logistic regression. The
Bayesian view also includes the speciﬁcation of the prior, which includes
design choices such as conjugacy (Section 6.6.1) with the likelihood. Ad-
ditionally, one could consider latent functions as priors, which results in
Gaussian process classiﬁcation (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006, chapter
3).
