Diﬀerentiating Polynomials
How to make sense of x2 −a2
x −a
for x = a?
Of course, we just factor the numerator
and cancel x −a, so we get
(x2)′ = x2 −a2
x −a |x=a = (x + a)(x −a)
x −a
|x=a = 2x,
and now we can diﬀerentiate x2.
With a bit more work we get
(x3)′ = 3x2, (x4)′ = 4x3,
 , (xn)′ = nxn−1
This trick will work for any polynomial f(x)
because x −a divides f(x) −f(a), so
f ′(x) = f(x) −f(a)
x −a
|x=a
We don’t have to divide polynomials because of...

Diﬀerentiation Rules
•
(f + g)′ = f ′ + g′
•
(kf)′ = kf ′ for any constant k
•
(fg)′ = f ′g + fg′
•
(f(g(x))′ = f ′(g(x))g′(x)
Demonstrating these rules for polynomials
is a matter of simple algebra of course.

It’s the same problem that we started with,
turned upside down, so we know what to do.

Implicit Diﬀerentiation, Quotients
Another way to derive the formula for (
x
n√)′ is
to rewrite y =
x
n√
as yn = x, to diﬀerentiate this
equation to get nyn−1y′ = 1 and to solve for y′.
This trick, called implicit diﬀerentiation, makes
it easy to get (xm/n)′, (u/v)′ and even y′
if y7 + y + x = 0, when we are at a loss
to derive a formula for y itself.
We are stretching it a bit here, of course, by
assuming that y′ is deﬁned, but it turnes out
O.K. if we don’t have to divide
by zero, as the implicit function theorem says.

and we meet our old friend again.
But geometrically speaking, the area under 1/x
makes sense, we just have to ﬁgure out what
it is. To do it, we just look at the picture...

A(1,2)
A(3,6)=A(1,2)
A(1,2*3)=A(1,6)=A(1,3)+A(3,6)=A(1,2)+A(1,3)
...and see that it is some sort of a logarithm.
It is called the natural logarithm, so
Z

b
dx/x = ln(b) −ln(a),
Z
dx/x = ln(x) + C,
and (ex)′ = ex (by implicit diﬀerentiation).

we arrive at the estimate
f(x) −f(a) −f ′(a)(x −a)| ⩽K(x −a)2
and call f ULD (uniformly Lipschitz diﬀerentiable).
It follows that

f(x) −f(a)
x −a
−f ′(a)
 ⩽K|x −a|,
and we conclude that |f ′(x) −f ′(a)| ⩽2K|x −a|,
i.e. f ′ is Lipschitz.

Increasing function theorem
f ′ ⩾0 and A ⩽B ⇒f(A) ⩽f(B)
We ﬁrst assume that f ′ ⩾c > 0 and look at
the estimate deﬁning ULD. We see that
0 ⩽x −a ⩽c/K ⇒f(a) ⩽f(x),
and therefore f(A) ⩽f(B)because we can get
from A to B by taking steps shorter than c/K
(according to Archimedes).
Now for f ′ ⩾0 we can conclude that
f(B) −f(A) ⩾−c(B −A) for any c > 0,
and therefore f(A) ⩽f(B). Q.E.D.
