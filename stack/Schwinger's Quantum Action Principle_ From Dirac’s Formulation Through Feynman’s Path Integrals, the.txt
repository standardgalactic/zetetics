Abstract
Starting from the earlier notions of stationary action principles, we show how Julian
Schwinger’s Quantum Action Principle descended from Dirac’s formulation, which
independently led Feynman to his path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics.
The connection between the two is brought out, and applications are discussed. The
Keldysh-Schwinger time-cycle method of extracting matrix elements in nonequi-
librium situations is described. The variational formulation of quantum ﬁeld theory
and the development of source theory constitute the latter part of this work. In this
document, derived from Schwinger’s lectures over four decades, the continuity of
concepts, such as that of Green’s functions, becomes apparent.

Historical Introduction
Variationalprinciplesfordynamicalsystemshavealonghistory.Althoughprecursors
go back at least to Leibnitz (see for example (Euler 1752)) and Euler (1744) the
“principle of least action” was given modern form by de Maupertuis (1744, 1746).
We will not attempt to trace the history here; a brief useful account is given in
Sommerfeld’s lectures (Sommerfeld 1964). The most important names in the history
of the development of dynamical systems, or at least those that will bear most directly
onthefollowingdiscussion,arethoseofLagrange(1788)andHamilton(1834,1835).
Here we are concentrating on the work of Julian Schwinger (1918–1994), who
had profound and pervasive inﬂuence on 20th century physics, and whose many
students have become leaders in diverse ﬁelds.1 For biographical information about
his life and work see (Mehra 2000; Milton 2007). Therefore, we will take up the
story in the modern era. Shortly after Dirac’s work with Fock and Podolsky (Dirac
1932), in which the demonstration of the equivalence between his theory of quantum
electrodynamics, and that of Heisenberg and Pauli (Heisenberg 1929), P. A. M.
Dirac wrote a paper on “The Lagrangian in Quantum Mechanics” (Dirac 1933).
This paper had a profound inﬂuence on Richard Feynman’s doctoral dissertation at
Princeton on “The Principles of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics” (Feynman
1942), and on his later work on the formulations of the “Space-Time Approach to
Quantum Electrodynamics” (Feynman 1949). Dirac’s paper further formed the basis
for Schwinger’s development of the quantum action principle, which ﬁrst appeared
in his ﬁnal operator ﬁeld formulation of quantum ﬁeld theory (Schwinger 1951b),
which we will describe in Chap.6.
The response of Feynman and Schwinger to Dirac’s inspiring paper was
completely different. Feynman was to give a global “solution” to the problem of
1For complex reasons, Schwinger’s inﬂuence on modern physics is not widely appreciated. His
contributions to our current understanding of nature are underrepresented in textbooks, with some
notable exceptions (Toms 2007).

Historical Introduction
determining the transformation function, the probability amplitude connecting the
state of the system at one time to that at a later time, in terms of a sum over classical
trajectories, the famous path integral. Schwinger, instead, derived (initially postu-
lated) a differential equation for that transformation function in terms of a quantum
action functional. This differential equation possessed Feynman’s path integral as a
formal solution, which remained poorly deﬁned; but Schwinger believed throughout
his life that his approach was “more general, more elegant, more useful, and more
tied to the historical line of development as the quantum transcription of Hamilton’s
action principle” (Schwinger 1973).
Later, in a tribute to Feynman, Schwinger commented further. Dirac, of course,
was the father of transformation theory (Dirac 1927). The transformation function
from a description of the system at time t2 to a description at time t1 is “the product of
all the transformations functions associated with the successive inﬁnitesimal incre-
ments in time.” Dirac said the latter, that is, the transformation function from time t
to time t + dt corresponds to exp[(i/ℏ)dt L], where L is the Lagrangian expressed
in terms of the coordinates at the two times. For the transformation function between
t2 and t1 “the integrand is exp[(i/ℏ)W]. where W =
 t1
t2 dt L.” “Now we know, and
Dirac surely knew, that to within a constant factor the ‘correspondence,’ for inﬁn-
itesimal dt, is an equality when we deal with a system of nonrelativistic particles
possessing a coordinate-dependent potential energy V …. Why then, did Dirac not
make a more precise, if less general statement? Because he was interested in a gen-
eral question: What, in quantum mechanics, corresponds to the classical principle of
stationary action?”
“Why, in the decade that followed, didn’t someone pick up the computational
possibilities offered by this integral approach to the time transformation function?
To answer this question bluntly, perhaps no one needed it—until Feynman came
along.” (Schwinger 1989a).
But Schwinger followed the differential route, and starting in early 1950 began
a new, his third, formulation of quantum electrodynamics, based on a variational
approach. This was ﬁrst published in 1951 (Schwinger 1951b). A bit later he started
developing a new formulation of quantum kinematics, which he called Measurement
Algebra, which got its ﬁrst public presentation at École de Physique des Houches
in the summer of 1955. There were several short notes in the Proceedings of the
US National Academy published in 1960, explaining both the quantum kinematical
approach and the dynamical action principle (Schwinger 1960a–d), but although
he often promised to write a book on the subject (as he also promised a book on
quantum ﬁeld theory) nothing came of it. Les Houches lectures, based on notes
taken by Robert Kohler, eventually appeared in 1970 (Schwinger 1970a). Lectures
based on a UCLA course on quantum mechanics by Schwinger were eventually
published under Englert’s editorship (Schwinger 2001). The incompleteness of the
written record may be partly alleviated by the present essay.
We start on a classical footing.

Chapter 2
Review of Classical Action Principles
This section grew out of lectures given by Schwinger at UCLA around 1974,
which were substantially transformed into Chap.8 of Classical Electrodynamics
(Schwinger 1998). (Remarkably, considering his work on waveguide theory during
World War II, now partially recorded in Ref. (Milton 2006), he never gave lectures
on this subject at Harvard after 1947.)
We start by reviewing and generalizing the Lagrange-Hamilton principle for a
single particle. The action, W12, is deﬁned as the time integral of the Lagrangian,
L, where the integration extends from an initial conﬁguration or state at time t2 to a
ﬁnal state at time t1:
W12 =
 t1
t2
dt L.
(2.1)
The integral refers to any path, any line of time development, from the initial to
the ﬁnal state, as shown in Fig. 2.1. The actual time evolution of the system is
selected by the principle of stationary action: In response to inﬁnitesimal variations
of the integration path, the action W12 is stationary—does not have a corresponding
inﬁnitesimal change—for variations about the correct path, provided the initial and
ﬁnal conﬁgurations are held ﬁxed,
δW12 = 0.
(2.2)
This means that, if we allow inﬁnitesimal changes at the initial and ﬁnal times,
including alterations of those times, the only contribution to δW12 then comes from
the endpoint variations, or
δW12 = G1 −G2,
(2.3)
where Ga, a = 1 or 2, is a function, called the generator, depending on dynamical
variables only at time ta. In the following, we will consider three different realizations

particle.
2.1 Lagrangian Viewpoint
The nonrelativistic motion of a particle of mass m moving in a potential V (r, t) is
described by the Lagrangian
L = 1
2m
dr

−V (r, t).
(2.4)
Here, the independent variables are r and t, so that two kinds of variations can be
considered. First, a particular motion is altered inﬁnitesimally, that is, the path is
changed by an amount δr:
r(t) →r(t) + δr(t).
(2.5)
Second, the ﬁnal and initial times can be altered inﬁnitesimally, by δt1 and δt2,
respectively. It is more convenient, however, to think of these time displacements as
produced by a continuous variation of the time parameter, δt(t),
t →t + δt(t),
(2.6)
so chosen that, at the endpoints,
δt(t1) = δt1,
δt(t2) = δt2.
(2.7)
The corresponding change in the time differential is
dt →d(t + δt) =

energy, (2.12b). The signiﬁcance of (2.12c) will be discussed later in Sect.2.4.

2.2 Hamiltonian Viewpoint
Using the above deﬁnition of the momentum, we can rewrite the Lagrangian as
L = p·
dr
dt −H(r, p, t),
(2.13)
where we have introduced the Hamiltonian
H = p2
2m + V (r, t).
(2.14)
We are here to regard r, p, and t as independent variables in
W12 =
 1

[p·dr −dt H].
(2.15)
The change in the action, when r, p, and t are all varied, is

The action principle then implies

(2.17b)

(2.17c)
G = p·δr −Hδt.
(2.17d)
In contrast with the Lagrangian differential equations of motion, which involve sec-
ond derivatives, these Hamiltonian equations contain only ﬁrst derivatives; they are
called ﬁrst-order equations. They describe the same physical system, because when
(2.17a) is substituted into (2.17b), we recover the Lagrangian-Newtonian equation
(2.12a). Furthermore, if we insert (2.17a) into the Hamiltonian (2.14), we identify
H with E. The third equation (2.17c) is then identical with (2.12b). We also note the
equivalence of the two versions of G.

2.2 Hamiltonian Viewpoint

But probably the most direct way of seeing that the same physical system is
involved comes by writing the Lagrangian in the Hamiltonian viewpoint as
L = m

dr

−V −1
2m

p −m dr

2
.
(2.18)
The result of varying p in the stationary action principle is to produce
p = m dr
dt .
(2.19)
But, if we accept this as the deﬁnition of p, the corresponding term in L disappears
and we explicitly regain the Lagrangian description. We are justiﬁed in completely
omitting the last term on the right side of (2.18), despite its dependence on the
variables r and t, because of its quadratic structure. Its explicit contribution to δL is

(2.20)
and the equation supplied by the stationary action principle for p variations, (2.19),
also guarantees that there is no contribution here to the results of r and t variations.
2.3 A Third, Schwingerian, Viewpoint
Here we take r, p, and the velocity, v, as independent variables, so that the Lagrangian
is written in the form

(2.24d)
G = p·δr −Hδt.
(2.24e)
Notice that there is no equation of motion for v since dv/dt does not occur in the
Lagrangian, nor is it multiplied by a time derivative. Consequently, (2.24c) refers to
a single time and is an equation of constraint.
From this third approach, we have the option of returning to either of the other
two viewpoints by imposing an appropriate restriction. Thus, if we write (2.22) as
H(r, p, v, t) = p2
2m + V (r, t) −1
2m (p −mv)2,
(2.25)
and we adopt
v = 1
m p
(2.26)
as the deﬁnition of v, we recover the Hamiltonian description, (2.13) and (2.14).
Alternatively, we can present the Lagrangian (2.21) as
L = m

−V + (p −mv)·
dr

(2.27)
Then, if we adopt the following as deﬁnitions,
v = dr
dt ,
p = mv,
(2.28)
the resultant form of L is that of the Lagrangian viewpoint, (2.4). It might seem that
only the deﬁnition v = dr/dt, inserted in (2.27), sufﬁces to regain the Lagrangian
description.Butthenthenexttolasttermin(2.27)wouldgivethefollowingadditional

(p −mv)·

(2.29)
In the next Chapter, where the action formulation of electrodynamics is consid-
ered, we will see the advantage of adopting this third approach, which is characterized
by the introduction of additional variables, similar to v, for which there are no equa-
tions of motion.
2.4 Invariance and Conservation Laws
There is more content to the principle of stationary action than equations of motion.
Suppose one considers a variation such that
δW12 = 0,
(2.30)
independently of the choice of initial and ﬁnal times. We say that the action, which is
left unchanged, is invariant under this alteration of path. Then the stationary action
principle (2.3) asserts that
δW12 = G1 −G2 = 0,
(2.31)
or, there is a quantity G(t) that has the same value for any choice of time t; it is
conserved in time. A differential statement of that is
d
dt G(t) = 0.
(2.32)
The G functions, which are usually referred to as generators, express the interrelation
between conservation laws and invariances of the system.
Invariance implies conservation, and vice versa. A more precise statement is the
following:
If there is a conservation law, the action is stationary under an inﬁnitesimal transformation
in an appropriate variable.
The converse of this statement is also true.
If the action W is invariant under an inﬁnitesimal transformation (that is, δW = 0), then
there is a corresponding conservation law.
This is the celebrated theorem of Amalie Emmy Noether (Noether 1918).
Here are some examples. Suppose the Hamiltonian of (2.13) does not depend
explicitly on time, or

Fig. 2.2 δω × r is
perpendicular to δω and r,
and represents an
inﬁnitesimal rotation of r
about the δω axis

δω × r
Then the variation (which as a rigid displacement in time, amounts to a shift in the
time origin)
δt = constant
(2.34)
will give δW12 = 0 [see the ﬁrst line of (2.16), with δr = 0, δp = 0, dδt/dt = 0,
∂H/∂t = 0]. The conclusion is that G in (2.17d), which here is just
Gt = −Hδt,
(2.35)
is a conserved quantity, or that
d H
dt = 0.
(2.36)
This inference, that the Hamiltonian—the energy—is conserved, if there is no explicit
time dependence in H, is already present in (2.17c). But now a more general principle
is at work.
Next, consider an inﬁnitesimal, rigid rotation, one that maintains the lengths and
scalar products of all vectors. Written explicitly for the position vector r, it is
δr = δω × r,
(2.37)
where the constant vector δω gives the direction and magnitude of the rotation (see
Fig. 2.2). Now specialize (2.14) to
H = p2
2m + V (r),
(2.38)
where r = |r|, a rotationally invariant structure. Then
W12 =
 1
2
[p·dr −H dt]
(2.39)
is also invariant under the rigid rotation, implying the conservation of

2.4 Invariance and Conservation Laws
11
Gδω = p·δr = δω·r × p.
(2.40)
This is the conservation of angular momentum,
L = r × p,
d
dt L = 0.
(2.41)
Of course, this is also contained within the equation of motion,
d
dt L = −r × ∇V = −r×ˆr∂V
∂r = 0,
(2.42)
since V depends only on |r|.
Conservation of linear momentum appears analogously when there is invariance
under a rigid translation. For a single particle, (2.17b) tells us immediately that p is
conserved if V is a constant, say zero. Then, indeed, the action
W12 =
 1
2

p·dr −p2


(2.43)
is invariant under the displacement
δr = δϵ = constant,
(2.44)
and
Gδ = p·δϵ
(2.45)
is conserved. But the general principle acts just as easily for, say, a system of two
particles, a and b, with Hamiltonian
H =
p2

2ma

(2.46)
This Hamiltonian and the associated action

(2.47)
are invariant under the rigid translation
δra = δrb = δϵ,
(2.48)
with the implication that
Gδϵ = pa·δra + pb·δrb = (pa + pb)·δϵ
(2.49)

Review of Classical Action Principles
is conserved. This is the conservation of the total linear momentum,
P = pa + pb,
d
dt P = 0.
(2.50)
Something a bit more general appears when we consider a rigid translation that
grows linearly in time:
δra = δrb = δv t,
(2.51)
using the example of two particles. This gives each particle the common additional
velocity δv, and therefore must also change their momenta,
δpa = maδv,
δpb = mbδv.
(2.52)
The response of the action (2.47) to this variation is
δW12 =
 1
2
[(pa + pb)·δv dt + δv·(madra + mbdrb) −(pa + pb)·δv dt]
=
 1
2
d[(mara + mbrb)·δv].
(2.53)
The action is not invariant; its variation has end-point contributions. But there is still
a conservation law, not of G = P·δvt, but of N·δv, where
N = Pt −(mara + mbrb).
(2.54)
Written in terms of the center-of-mass position vector
R = mara + mbrb
M

M = ma + mb,
(2.55)
the statement of conservation of
N = Pt −MR,
(2.56)
namely
0 = dN
dt = P −M dR
dt ,
(2.57)
is the familiar fact that the center of mass of an isolated system moves at the constant
velocity given by the ratio of the total momentum to the total mass of that system.

Theactionprinciplealsosuppliesusefulnonconservationlaws.Consider,forconstant
δλ,
δr = δλr,
δp = −δλp,
(2.58)
which leaves p·dr invariant,
δ(p·dr) = (−δλp)·dr + p·(δλdr) = 0.
(2.59)
But the response of the Hamiltonian
H = T (p) + V (r),
T (p) = p2
2m ,
(2.60)
is given by the noninvariant form
δH = δλ(−2T + r·∇V ).
(2.61)
Therefore we have, for an arbitrary time interval, for the variation of the action (2.15),
δW12 =

(2.63)
For the particular situation of the Coulomb potential between charges, V =
constant/r, where
r·∇V = r d
dr V = −V,
(2.64)
the virial theorem asserts that
d
dt (r·p) = 2T + V.
(2.65)
We apply this to a bound system produced by a force of attraction. On taking the
time average of (2.65) the time derivative term disappears. That is because, over an
arbitrarily long time interval τ = t1 −t2, the value of r·p(t1) can differ by only a
ﬁnite amount from r·p(t2), and

This chapter again grew out of Schwinger’s UCLA lectures. These evolved, tortur-
ously, into Chap.9 of Classical Electrodynamics (Schwinger 1998). Here we use
Gaussian units.
3.1 Action of Particle in Field
It was stated in our review of mechanical action principles in the previous chapter that
the third viewpoint, which employs the variables r, p, and v, was particularly conve-
nient for describing electromagnetic forces on charged particles. With the explicit,
and linear, appearance of v in what plays the role of the potential function when
magnetic ﬁelds are present, we begin to see the basis for that remark. Indeed, we
have only to consult (2.21) to ﬁnd the appropriate Lagrangian:

3.2 Electrodynamic Action
The electromagnetic ﬁeld is a mechanical system. It contributes its variables to the
action, to the Lagrangian of the whole system of charges and ﬁelds. In contrast with
the point charges, the ﬁeld is distributed in space. Its Lagrangian should therefore
be, not a summation over discrete points, but an integration over all spatial volume
elements,
Lﬁeld =

(dr) Lﬁeld;
(3.6)
this introduces the Lagrange function, or Lagrangian density, L. The total Lagrangian
must be the sum of the particle part, (3.1), and the ﬁeld part, (3.6), where the latter
must be chosen so as to give the Maxwell equations, in Gaussian units:
∇× B = 1

∂
∂t E + 4π
c j,
∇·E = 4πρ,
(3.7a)
−∇× E = 1

∇·B = 0.
(3.7b)
The homogeneous equations here are equivalent to the construction of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld in term of potentials, or,

∂t A = −E −∇φ,
(3.8a)
B = ∇× A.
(3.8b)

3.2 Electrodynamic Action
17
Thus, we recognize that A(r, t), E(r, t), in analogy with r(t), p(t), obey equations
of motion while φ(r, t), B(r, t), as analogues of v(t), do not. There are enough
clues here to give the structure of Lﬁeld, apart from an overall factor. The anticipated
complete Lagrangian for microscopic electrodynamics is

The terms that are summed in (3.9) describe the behavior of charged particles
under the inﬂuence of the ﬁelds, while the terms that are integrated describe the ﬁeld
behavior. The independent variables are
ra(t),
va(t),
pa(t),
φ(r, t),
A(r, t),
E(r, t),
B(r, t),

(3.10)
We now look at the response of the Lagrangian to variations in each of these variables
separately, starting with the particle part:

which are the known results, (3.2a)–(3.2c).
The real work now lies in deriving the equations of motion for the ﬁelds. In order
to cast all the ﬁeld-dependent terms into integral form, we introduce charge and
current densities,

The volume integrals extend over sufﬁciently large regions to contain all the ﬁelds of
interest. Consequently, we can integrate by parts and ignore the surface terms. The
responses of the Lagrangian (3.9) to ﬁeld variations, and the corresponding equations
of motion deduced from the action principle are

We therefore recover Maxwell’s equations, two of which are implicit in the con-
struction of E and B in terms of potentials. By making a time variation of the action

action principle—that is, they are already subsumed in Eqs. (3.15)],

is reached by eliminating all variables that do not obey equations of motion, and,
correspondingly, do not appear in G. Those “superﬂuous” variables are the va and
the ﬁelds φ and B, which are eliminated by using (3.12b), (3.15b), and (3.15h), the
equations without time derivatives, resulting, ﬁrst, in the intermediate form

The ﬁrst term here is the energy of the particles moving in the ﬁeld [particle energy—
see (3.5b)], so we might call the second term the ﬁeld energy. The ambiguity of these
terms (whether the potential energy of particles is attributed to them or to the ﬁelds,
or to both) is evident from the existence of a simpler form of the Hamiltonian

from the dynamical description. But, in fact, it has not. If we vary the Lagrangian
(3.19), where H is given by (3.21), with respect to E we ﬁnd

by charge conservation. Observe that (3.28) and (3.30) are equal in magnitude and
opposite in sign, so that their sum is zero. This proves the statement of energy
conservation (3.26).
3.4 Momentum and Angular Momentum Conservation
The action principle not only provides us with the ﬁeld equations, particle equations
of motion, and expressions for the energy, but also with the generators (3.18b).
The generators provide a connection between conservation laws and invariances
of the action (recall Sect.2.4). Here we will further illustrate this connection by
deriving momentum and angular momentum conservation from the invariance of the
action under rigid coordinate translations and rotations, respectively. [In a similar
way we could derive energy conservation, (3.26), from the invariance under time
displacements—see also Sect.3.6].
Under an inﬁnitesimal rigid coordinate displacement, δϵ, a given point which is
described by r in the old coordinate system is described by r + δϵ in the new one.
(See Fig. 3.1.) The response of the particle term in (3.18b) is simple: δϵ·

a pa; for
the ﬁeld part, we require the change, δA, of the vector potential induced by the rigid
Fig. 3.1 Rigid coordinate
displacement, where the new
coordinate system is
displaced by a rigid
translation −δϵ relative to
the old coordinate system

22
3

coordinate displacement. The value of a ﬁeld F at a physical point P is unchanged
under such a displacement, so that if r and r +δϵ are the coordinates of P in the two
frames, there are corresponding functions F and F such that
F(P) = F(r) = F(r + δϵ),
(3.32)
that is, the new function F of the new coordinate equals the old function F of the
old coordinate. The change in the function F at the same coordinate is given by
F(r) = F(r) + δF(r),
(3.33)
so that
δF(r) = F(r −δϵ) −F(r) = −δϵ·∇F(r),
(3.34)
for a rigid translation (not a rotation).
As an example, consider the charge density
ρ(r) =
	
a
eaδ(r −ra).
(3.35)
If the positions of all the particles, the ra, are displaced by δϵ, the charge density
changes to
ρ(r) + δρ(r) =
	
a
eaδ(r −ra −δϵ),
(3.36)
where
δ(r −ra −δϵ) = δ(r −ra) −δϵ·∇rδ(r −ra),
(3.37)
and therefore
δρ(r) = −δϵ·∇ρ(r),
(3.38)
in agreement with (3.34).
So the ﬁeld part of G in (3.18b) is

where the last rearrangement makes use of (3.15b) and (3.15h), and the vector identity
δϵ × (∇× A) = ∇(δϵ·A) −(δϵ·∇)A.
(3.40)
Including the particle part from (3.18b) we ﬁnd the generator corresponding to a
rigid coordinate displacement can be written as

with G the momentum density. Since the action is invariant under a rigid displace-
ment,
0 = δW = G1 −G2 = (P1 −P2)·δr,
(3.43)
we see that
P1 = P2,
(3.44)
that is, the total momentum, P, is conserved. This, of course, can also be veriﬁed by
explicit calculation:

(3.45)
from which the constancy of P follows.
Similar arguments can be carried out for a rigid rotation for which the change in
the coordinate vector is
δr = δω × r,
(3.46)
with δω constant. The corresponding change in a vector function is
A(r + δr) = A(r) + δω × A(r)
(3.47)
since a vector transforms in the same way as r, so the new function at the initial
numerical values of the coordinates is
A(r) = A(r) −(δr·∇)A(r) + δω × A(r).
(3.48)
The change in the vector potential is
δA = −(δr·∇)A + δω × A.

3.5 Gauge Invariance and the Conservation of Charge
An electromagnetic system possesses a conservation law, that of electric charge,
which has no place in the usual mechanical framework. It is connected to a further
invariance of the electromagnetic ﬁelds—the potentials are not uniquely deﬁned in
that if we let
A →A + ∇λ,
φ →φ −1
c
∂
∂t λ,
(3.52)
theelectricandmagneticﬁeldsdeﬁnedby(3.15f)and(3.15h)remainunaltered,foran
arbitrary function λ. This is called gauge invariance; the corresponding substitution
(3.52) is a gauge transformation. [The term has its origin in a now obsolete theory
of Hermann Weyl (1885–1955) (Weyl 1919).]
This invariance of the action must imply a corresponding conservation law. To
determine what is conserved, we compute the change in the Lagrangian, (3.9), explic-
itly. Trivially, the ﬁeld part of L remains unchanged. In considering the change of the
particle part, we recognize that (3.52) is incomplete; since v is a physical quantity,
p −(e/c)A must be invariant under a gauge transformation, which will only be true
if (3.52) is supplemented by
p →p + e
c∇λ.
(3.53)
Under the transformation (3.52) and (3.53), the Lagrangian becomes

3.5 Gauge Invariance and the Conservation of Charge
25
What is the physical consequence of adding a total time derivative to a Lagrangian?
It does not change the equations of motion, so the system is unaltered. Since the
entire change is in the end point behavior,
W 12 = W12 + (w1 −w2),
(3.56)
the whole effect is a redeﬁnition of the generators, G,
G = G + δw.
(3.57)
This alteration reﬂects the fact that the Lagrangian itself is ambiguous up to a total
time derivative term. [This term may also be seen as arising from the ﬁeld term in
the generator (3.18b).]
To ascertain the implication of gauge invariance, we rewrite the change in the
Lagrangian given in the ﬁrst line of (3.54) by use of (3.12c),
L −L = 1
c

(dr)


Inviewof thearbitrarynatureofδλ(r, t), thestationaryactionprinciplenowdemands
that, at every point,
∂
∂t ρ + ∇·j = 0,
(3.61)
that is, gauge invariance implies local charge conservation. (Of course, this same
result follows from Maxwell’s equations.) Then, the special situation δλ = constant,
where δA = δφ = 0, and W12 is certainly invariant, implies a conservation law, that
of

3.6 Gauge Invariance and Local Conservation Laws
We have just derived the local conservation law of electric charge. Electric charge is
a property carried only by the particles, not by the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In contrast,
the mechanical properties of energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum are
attributes of both particles and ﬁelds. For these we have conservation laws of total
quantities. What about local conservation laws? The usual development of electro-
dynamics refers to local non-conservation laws; they concentrated on the ﬁelds and
characterized the charged particles as sources (or sinks) of ﬁeld mechanical proper-
ties. It is natural to ask for a more even-handed treatment of both charges and ﬁelds.
We shall supply it, in the framework of a particular example. The property of gauge
invariance will be both a valuable guide, and an aid to simplifying the calculations.
The time displacement of a complete physical system identiﬁes its total energy.
This suggests that time displacement of a part of the system provides energetic
information about that portion. The ultimate limit of this spatial subdivision, a local
description, should appear in response to an (inﬁnitesimal) time displacement that
varies arbitrarily in space as well as in time, δt(r, t).
Now we need a clue. How do ﬁelds, and potentials, respond to such coordinate-
dependentdisplacements?Thisiswherethefreedomofgaugetransformationsenters:
The change of the vector and scalar potentials, by ∇λ(r, t), −(1/c)(∂/∂t)λ(r, t),
respectively, serves as a model for the potentials themselves. The advantage here is
that the response of the scalar λ(r, t) to the time displacement can be reasonably
taken to be
(λ + δλ)(r, t + δt) = λ(r, t),
(3.64a)
or
δλ(r, t) = −δt(r, t) ∂
∂t λ(r, t).
(3.64b)
Then we derive

δφ = −δt ∂

δA = cδtE + ∇(φcδt),
(3.67a)
δφ = −1
c
∂
∂t (φcδt).
(3.67b)
In the latter form we recognize a gauge transformation, produced by the scalar φcδt,
which will not contribute to the changes of ﬁeld strengths. Accordingly, for that
calculation we have, effectively, δA = cδtE, δφ = 0, leading to
δE = −1

∂t B −E × ∇cδt;
(3.68b)
the last line employs the ﬁeld equation ∇× E = −(1/c)(∂B/∂t).
In the following we adopt a viewpoint in which such homogeneous ﬁeld equations
are accepted as consequences of the deﬁnition of the ﬁelds in terms of potentials.
That permits the ﬁeld Lagrange function (3.9) to be simpliﬁed:
Lﬁeld = 1
8π (E2 −B2).
(3.69)
Then we can apply the ﬁeld variation (3.68b) directly, and get
δLﬁeld = −δt ∂
∂t Lﬁeld −1
4π E2 ∂
∂t δt −c
4π E × B·∇δt
= −∂
∂t (δtLﬁeld) −1

4π E × B·∇δt.
(3.70)
Before commenting on these last, not unfamiliar, ﬁeld structures, we turn to the
chargedparticlesandputthemonasomewhatsimilarfootingintermsofacontinuous,
rather than a discrete, description.
We therefore present the Lagrangian of the charges in (3.9) in terms of a corre-
sponding Lagrange function,
Lcharges =

Then, the effect of the time displacement on the variables ra(t), taken as
(ra + δra)(t + δt) = ra(t),
(3.72a)
δra(t) = −δt(ra, t)va(t),

(3.73)
the last step exhibits both the explicit and the implicit dependences of δt(ra, t) on
t. In computing the variation of φ(ra, t), for example, we combine the potential
variation given in (3.66b) with the effect of δra:
δφ(ra(t), t) = −δt ∂
∂t φ −φ ∂
∂t δt −δtva·∇aφ = −δt d
dt φ −φ ∂
∂t δt,

and, similarly,
δA(ra(t), t) = −δt ∂
∂t A + φc∇δt −δtva·∇aA = −δt d
dt A + φc∇δt.
(3.74b)

We have retained the particle symbol d/dt to the last, but now, being ﬁrmly back
in the ﬁeld, space-time viewpoint, it should be written as ∂/∂t, referring to all t
dependence, with r being held ﬁxed. The union of these various contributions to the
variation of the total Lagrange function is
δLtot = −∂

at t1 and t2. Then, through partial integration, we conclude that

Chapter 4
Quantum Action Principle
This Chapter, and the following one, are based on lectures given by the author in
quantum ﬁeld theory courses at the University of Oklahoma over several years, based
in turn largely on lectures given by Schwinger at Harvard in the late 1960s.
After the above reminder of classical variational principles, we now turn to the
dynamics of quantum mechanics. We begin by considering the transformation func-
tion ⟨a′, t + dt|b′, t⟩. Here |b′, t⟩is a state speciﬁed by the values b′ = {b′} of a
complete set of dynamical variables B(t), while |a′, t + dt⟩is a state speciﬁed by
values a′ = {a′} of a (different) complete set of dynamical variables A(t + dt),
deﬁned at a slightly later time.1 We suppose that A and B do not possess any explicit
time dependence—that is, their deﬁnition does not depend upon t. Here
⟨a′, t + dt| = ⟨a′, t|U,
(4.1)
where the inﬁnitesimal time translation operator is related to the generator of time
translations as follows,
U = 1 + iG = 1 −i dt H.
(4.2)
The Hamiltonian H is a function of dynamical variables, which we write generically
as χ(t), and of t explicitly. Thus
⟨a′, t + dt|b′, t⟩= ⟨a′, t|1 −i dt H(χ(t), t)|b′, t⟩.
(4.3)
1Here Schwinger is using his standard notation, designating eigenvalues by primes.

Quantum Action Principle
We next translate states and operators to time zero:
⟨a′, t| = ⟨a′|U(t),
|b′, t⟩= U −1(t)|b′⟩,
(4.4a)
χ(t) = U −1(t)χU(t),
(4.4b)
where χ = χ(0), etc. Then,
⟨a′, t + dt|b′, t⟩= ⟨a′|1 −i dt H(χ, t)|b′⟩,
(4.5)
or, as a differential equation
δdyn⟨a′, t + dt|b′, t⟩= i⟨a′|δdyn[−dt H]|b′⟩
= i⟨a′, t + dt|δdyn[−dt H(χ(t), t)]|b′, t⟩,
(4.6)
where δdyn corresponds to changes in initial and ﬁnal times, δt2 and δt1, and in the
structure of H, δH. [By reintroducing dt in the state on the left in the second line,
we make a negligible error of O(dt2).]
However,wecanalsoconsiderkinematical changes.Tounderstandthese,consider
a system deﬁned by coordinates and momenta, {qa(t)}, {pa(t)}, a = 1, . . . , n, which
satisfy the canonical commutation relations,
[qa(t), pb(t)] = iδab,
(ℏ= 1)
(4.7a)
[qa(t), qb(t)] = [pa(t), pb(t)] = 0.
(4.7b)
A spatial displacement δqa is induced by
U = 1 + iGq,
Gq =


a=1
paδqa.
(4.8)
In fact (δqa is a number, not an operator),
U −1qaU = qa −1
i [qa, Gq]
= qa −δqa,
(4.9)
while
U −1 paU = pa −1
i [pa, Gq] = pa.
(4.10)
The (dual) symmetry between position and momentum,
q →p,
p →−q,

gives us the form for the generator of a displacement in p:
G p = −


(4.12)
A kinematic variation in the states is given by the generators
δkin⟨| = ⟨| −⟨| = ⟨|iG,
(4.13a)
δkin| ⟩= | ⟩−| ⟩= −iG| ⟩,
(4.13b)
so, for example, under a δq variation, the transformation function changes by
δq⟨a′, t +dt|b′, t⟩= i⟨a′, t +dt|

a
[pa(t + dt)δqa(t + dt) −pa(t)δqa(t)] |b′, t⟩.
(4.14)
Now the dynamical variables at different times are related by Hamilton’s equations,
dpa(t)
dt
= 1
i [pa(t), H(q(t), p(t), t)]
= −∂H
∂qa
(t),
(4.15)
so
pa(t + dt) −pa(t) = dt dpa(t)
dt
= −dt ∂H
∂qa
(t).
(4.16)
Similarly, the other Hamilton’s equation
dqa
dt = ∂H
∂pa
(4.17)
implies that
qa(t + dt) −qa(t) = dt ∂H
∂pa
(t).
(4.18)
From this we deduce ﬁrst the q variation of the transformation function,

(4.23)
We now can unite the kinematic transformations considered here with the dynamic
ones considered earlier, in Eq. (4.6):
δ = δdyn + δkin :
δ⟨a′, t + dt|b′, dt⟩= i⟨a′, t + dt|δ[dt L]|b′, t⟩.
(4.24)
Suppose, for concreteness, that our states are deﬁned by values of q, so that
δp⟨a′, t + dt|b′t⟩= 0.
(4.25)

This is consistent, as a result of Hamilton’s equations,
δpLq =

(4.26)
In the following we will use Lq.
It is immediately clear that we can iterate the inﬁnitesimal version (4.24) of the
quantum action principle by inserting at each time step a complete set of intermediate
states (to simplify the notation, we ignore their quantum numbers):
⟨t1|t2⟩= ⟨t1|t1 −dt⟩⟨t1 −dt|t1 −2dt⟩· · · ⟨t2 + 2dt|t2 + dt⟩⟨t2 + dt|t2⟩, (4.27)
So in this way we deduce the general form of Schwinger’s quantum action principle:
δ⟨t1|t2⟩= i⟨t1|δ
	 t1
t2
dt L|t2⟩.
(4.28)
This summarizes all the properties of the system.
Suppose the dynamical system is given, that is, the structure of H does not change.
Then
δ⟨t1|t2⟩= i⟨t1|G1 −G2|t2⟩,
(4.29)
where the generator Ga depends on p and q at time ta. Comparing with the action
principle (4.28) we see
δ
	 t1
t2
dt L = G1 −G2,
(4.30)
which has exactly the form of the classical action principle (2.3), except that the
Lagrangian L and the generators G are now operators. If no changes occur at the
endpoints, we have the principle of stationary action,

(4.31)
As in the classical case, let us introduce a time parameter τ, t = t(τ), such that τ2
and τ1 are ﬁxed. Calling the new time parameter by the original name, the above
variation reads

We will again assume δpa, δqa are not operators (that is, they are proportional to the

(4.34c)
(Schwinger also explored the possibility of operator variations, see, for example, his
les Houches lectures (Schwinger 1970a).) We learn from the generators,
Gt = −H δt,
Gq =

a
paδqa,
(4.35)
that the change in some function F of the dynamical variable is
δF = dF

Note that from this the canonical commutation relations follow,

as well as Newton’s law,
˙pa = −1
i [H, pa] = −∂H

If we had used L p instead of Lq, we would have obtained the same equations of
motion, but in place of Gq, we would have obtained
G p = −

(4.40)
which implies
∂F
∂pa

(4.41)
From this can be deduced the remaining canonical commutator,
[qa, qb] = 0,
(4.42)
as well as the remaining Hamilton equation,
˙qa = 1
i [qa, H] = ∂H

.
(4.43)
It is easy to show that the effect of changing the Lagrangian by a total time derivative
(which is what is done in passing from Lq to L p) is to change the generators.
We now turn to examples.
4.1 Harmonic Oscillator
The harmonic oscillator is deﬁned in terms of creation and annihilation operators,2
y† and y, and the corresponding Hamiltonian H,
[y, y†] = 1,
(4.44a)
H = ω

y†y + 1

(4.44b)
The equations of motion are

i [y, H] = 1
i ωy,
(4.45a)
dy†
dt =1
i [y†, H] = −1
i ωy†.
(4.45b)
Eigenstates of y and y† exist, as right and left vectors, respectively,
2We follow Schwinger’s usage of y for the annihilation operator, instead of the more usual a.

Quantum Action Principle
y|y′⟩= y′|y′⟩,
(4.46a)
⟨y†′|y† = y†′⟨y†′|,
(4.46b)
while ⟨y′| and |y†′⟩do not exist.3 These are the famous “coherent states,” to whom the
name Roy Glauber (1963) is invariably attached, although they were discovered by
Erwin Schrödinger (1926), and Glauber’s approach, as he acknowledged, followed
that of his mentor, Schwinger (1953).
The transformation function we seek is therefore
⟨y†′, t1|y′′, t2⟩.
(4.48)
If we regard y as a “coordinate,” the corresponding “momentum” is iy†:
˙y = 1
i ωy = ∂H
∂iy† ,
i ˙y† = −ωy† = −∂H
∂y .
(4.49)
The corresponding Lagrangian is therefore4
L = iy†. ˙y −H.
(4.51)
Because we use y as our state variable at the initial time, and y† at the ﬁnal time, we
must exploit our freedom to redeﬁne our generators to write
W12 =
	 1
2
dt L −iy†(t1).y(t1).
(4.52)
Then the variation of the action is
δW12 = −iδ(y†
1.y1) + G1 −G2
= −iδy†
1.y1 −iy†
1.δy1 + iy†
1.δy1 −iy†
2.δy2 −H δt1 + H δt2
= −iδy†
1.y1 −iy†
2.δy2 −H(δt1 −δt2).

3If ⟨y′|y = y′⟨y′| then we would have an evident contradiction:
1 = ⟨y′|[y, y†]|y′⟩= y′⟨y′|y†|y′⟩−⟨y′|y†|y′⟩y′ = 0.
(4.47)
4We might note that in terms of (dimensionless) position and momentum operators

Then the quantum action principle says

1 y1 −iy†
2δy′′
2 −ωy†′
1 y1(δt1 −δt2)|y′′, t2⟩, (4.54)
since by assumption the variations in the dynamical variables are numerical:
[δy†
1, y1] = [y†
2, δy2],
(4.55)
and we have dropped the zero-point energy. Now use the equations of motion (4.45a)
and (4.45b) to deduce that
y1 = e−iω(t1−t2)y2,
y†
2 = e−iω(t1−t2)y†
1
(4.56)
and hence
δ⟨y†′, t1|y′′, t2⟩= ⟨y†′, t1|δy†′e−iω(t1−t2)y′′ + y†′e−iω(t1−t2)δy′′
−iωy†′e−iω(t1−t2)(δt1 −δt2)y′′|y′′, t2⟩
= ⟨y†′, t1|y′′, t2⟩δ

y†′e−iω(t1−t2)y′′
.
(4.57)
From this we can deduce that the transformation function has the exponential form
⟨y†′, t1|y′′, t2⟩= exp

y†′e−iω(t1−t2)y′′
,
(4.58)
which has the correct boundary condition at t1 = t2; and in particular, ⟨0|0⟩= 1.
On the other hand,
⟨y†′, t1|y′′, t2⟩= ⟨y†′|e−i H(t1−t2)|y′′⟩,
(4.59)
where both states are expressed at the common time t2, so, upon inserting a complete
set of energy eigenstates, we obtain (t = t1 −t2)

4.2 Forced Harmonic Oscillator
Now we add a driving term to the Hamiltonian,
H = ωy†y + yK ∗(t) + y†K(t),
(4.64)
where K(t) is an external force (Kraft is force in German). The equation of motion is
i dy
dt = ∂H
∂y† = [y, H] = ωy + K(t),
(4.65)
while y† satisﬁes the adjoint equation. In the presence of K(t), we wish to compute
the transformation function ⟨y†′, t1|y′′, t2⟩K .
Consider a variation of K. According to the action principle
δK ⟨y†′, t1|y′′, t2⟩K = ⟨y†′, t1|iδK W12|y′′, t2⟩K
= −i⟨y†′, t1|
	 t1
t2
dt[δKy† + δK ∗y]|y′′, t2⟩K .
(4.66)
We can solve this differential equation by noting that the equation of motion (4.65)
can be rewritten as
i d
dt

eiωty(t)

= eiωt K(t),
(4.67)
which is integrated to read
eiωty(t) −eiωt2y(t2) = −i

(4.72)
Thus our differential equation (4.66) reads

(4.74)
where the step function is

0, t < 0.
(4.75)
Since we already know the K = 0 value from Eq. (4.58), we may now immediately
integrate our differential equation:

The probability requirement

is thus satisﬁed. We see here a resonance effect: If the oscillator is driven close to
its natural frequency, so K(ω) is large, there is a large probability of ﬁnding the
system in an excited state, and therefore of not remaining in the ground state. Let us
calculate this transition amplitude to an excited state. By setting y′′ = 0 in Eq. (4.76)
we obtain

4.3 Feynman Path Integral Formulation
Although much more familiar, the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics
(Feynman 1942, 1949, 1965) is rather vaguely deﬁned. We will here provide a formal
“derivation” based on the Schwinger principle, in the harmonic oscillator context.
Consider a forced oscillator, deﬁned by the Lagrangian (note in this section, H does
not include the source terms)
L = iy†. ˙y −H(y, y†) −Ky† −K ∗y.
(4.94)

	 t1

motion
i ˙y −∂H
∂y† −K = 0,
−i ˙y† −∂H
∂y −K ∗= 0,
(4.97)

(4.99)

Since [[K, W], W] = 0, we can write the functional equation (4.98) as
0 = eiW[iδ/δK ∗,iδ/δK]Ke−iW[iδ/δK ∗,iδ/δK]⟨0, t1|0, t2⟩K .
(4.103)
The above equation has a solution (up to a constant), because both equations (4.97)
must hold,
⟨0, t1|0, t2⟩K = eiW[iδ/δK ∗,iδ/δK]δ[K]δ[K ∗],

classical limit, where ℏ→0.
4.3.1 Example
Consider the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, H = ωy†y. Suppose we wish to

which is evaluated by closing the ν contour in the upper half plane if t −t′ < 0, and

In a general sense, the exponent in Eq. (4.124) is an integrated form of the action. In
solving the equation of motion, we found in Eq. (4.89)
y(t) = e−iω(t−t2)y(t2) +
	
dt′G(t −t′)K(t′),
(4.126)
where the ﬁrst term is effectively zero here. The net effect is to replace an operator
by a number:
y′(t) =
	
dt′G(t −t′)K(t′).
(4.127)
Then Eq. (4.124) can be written as
⟨0t1|0t2⟩K = e−i

dt K ∗(t)y′(t).
(4.128)
Recall that the action was was the integral of the Lagrangian (4.94), or
W =
	
dt

y†i ∂
∂t y −ωy†y −y†K(t) −yK ∗(t)

,
(4.129)
so we see one term in Eq. (4.128) here, and the equation of motion (4.65) cancels
out the rest! So let’s add something which gives the equation for y′:
⟨0t1|0t2⟩K = e
i

dt

y†′i d
dt y′−ωy†′y′−y†′K−y′K ∗
= eiW.
(4.130)
Now insist that W is stationary with respect to variations of y′, y†′, and we recover
the equation of motion,

i d
dt −ω

y′(t) = K(t).
(4.131)
This is the starting point for the development of source theory, which will be treated
in Chap.7.

Chapter 5
Time-Cycle or Schwinger-Keldysh
Formulation
A further utility of the action principle is the time-cycle or Schwinger-Keldysh
formalism, which allows one to calculate matrix elements and consider nonequilib-
rium systems. Schwinger’s original work on this was his famous paper (Schwinger
1961); Keldysh’s paper appeared three years later (Keldysh 1964), and, rather mys-
teriously, cites the Martin-Schwinger equilibrium paper (Martin 1959), but not the
nonequilibrium one (Schwinger 1961). The following was extracted from notes from
Schwinger’s lectures given in 1968 at Harvard, as taken by the author.
Consider the expectation value of some physical property F(t) at a particular time
t1 in a state |b, t2⟩:
⟨F(t1)⟩b′t2 =

a′a′′
⟨b′t2|a′t1⟩⟨a′|F|a′′⟩⟨a′′t1|b′t2⟩,
(5.1)
which expresses the expectation value in terms of the matrix elements of the operator
F in a complete set of states deﬁned at time t1, {|a′t1⟩}. Suppose the operator F has
no explicit time dependence. Then we can use the action principle to write
δ⟨a′t1|b′t2⟩= i⟨a′t1|δ
 t1

|b′t2⟩,
(5.2a)
and so
δ⟨b′t2|a′t1⟩= −i⟨b′t2|δ
 t1

|a′t1⟩,
(5.2b)
which can be obtained from the ﬁrst equation by merely exchanging labels,

If we consider

a′
⟨b′t2|a′t1⟩⟨a′t1|b′t2⟩,
(5.4)
the above variational equations indeed asserts that
δ⟨b′t2|b′t2⟩= 0.
(5.5)
We can interpret the above as a cycle in time, going from time t2 to t1 and then
back again, as shown in Fig. 5.1. But, now imagine that the dynamics is different on
the forward and return trips, described by different Lagrangians L+ and L−. Then

In particular, consider a perturbation of the form,
H = H0 + λ(t)F,
(5.7)
where λ(t) is some time-varying parameter. If we have an inﬁnitesimal change, and,
for example, δλ+ ̸= 0, δλ−= 0, then
δλ+⟨b′t2|b′t2⟩λ+λ−= −i⟨b′t2|
 t1

(5.8)
If we choose δλ+ to be an impulse,
δλ+ = δλδ(t −t′),
(5.9)
in this way we obtain the expectation value of F(t′).

Let’s illustrate this with a driven harmonic oscillator, as described by Eq. (4.64),
so now
H+ = ωy†y + K ∗
+(t)y + K+(t)y†,
(5.10a)
H−= ωy†y + K ∗
−(t)y + K−(t)y†,
(5.10b)
which describes the oscillator evolving forward in time from t2 to t1 under the inﬂu-
ence of the force K+, and backward in time from t1 to t2 under the inﬂuence of K−,
as shown in Fig.5.2. From the variational principle we can learn all about y and y†.
We have already solved this problem by a more laborious method above, in Sect.4.2.
It sufﬁces to solve this problem with initial and ﬁnal ground states. If we consider
only a K ∗variation,

Now we must solve the equations of motion, so since effectively y(t2) →0, we have
from Eq. (4.69),
y+(t) = −i
 t
t2
dt′ e−iω(t−t′)K+(t′),
(5.12a)

which satisfy the same differential equation (4.87), we effectively have

dt dt′K ∗
−(t)Ga(t−t′)K−(t′)e

dt dt′K ∗
−(t)e−iω(t−t′)K+(t′).
(5.16)
This should reduce to 1 when K+ = K−= K, so
−iGr(t −t′) + iGa(t −t′) + e−iω(t−t′) = 0,
(5.17)
which is, indeed, true.
As an example, consider K−(t) = K(t), K+(t) = K(t + T ), that is, the second
source is displaced forward by a time T . This is sketched in Fig.5.3. What does this
mean? From a causal analysis, in terms of energy eigenstates, reading from right to
left,
⟨0t2|0t2⟩K−,K+ =

n
⟨0t2|nt1⟩K−=K(t)⟨nt1|0t2⟩K+=K(t+T ).
(5.18)
The effect on the second transformation function is the same as moving the n, t1 state
to a later time,
⟨nt1|0t2⟩K(t+T ) = ⟨nt1 + T |0t2⟩K(t) = e−inωT ⟨nt1|0t2⟩K(t),
(5.19)

which K−(t) = K(t),

so this says that
⟨0t2|0t2⟩K−K+ =

n
e−inωT p(n, 0)K ,
(5.20)
which gives us the probabilities directly. From the formula (5.16) we have, using
Eq. (5.17),
⟨0t2|0t2⟩K−K+ = e

dt dt′ K ∗(t)e−iω(t−t′)[K(t′+T )−K(t′)]

dt dt′ K ∗(t)e−iω(t−t′)[e−iωT −1]K(t′)]
= e|γ|2
e−iωT −1

,
(5.21)
where
γ =

dt eiωt K(t).
(5.22)
Thus we immediately obtain Eq. (4.84), or
p(n, 0)K = e−|γ|2 (|γ|2)n
n!
.
(5.23)
The above Eq. (5.21) can be directly used to ﬁnd certain average values. For
example,
⟨e−inωT ⟩K
0 = e|γ|2
e−iωT −1

.
(5.24)
Expand this for small ωT and we ﬁnd
⟨n⟩K
0 = |γ|2.
(5.25)
In a bit more systematic way we obtain the dispersion:
⟨e−i(n−⟨n⟩)ωT ⟩= e|γ|2(e−iωT −1+iωT ).
(5.26)
Expanding this to second order in ωT we get
⟨(n −⟨n⟩)2⟩= ⟨n2⟩−⟨n⟩2 ≡(n)2 = |γ|2 = ⟨n⟩,
(5.27)
or
n
⟨n⟩=
1
√⟨n⟩.
(5.28)
For large quantum numbers, which corresponds to the classical limit, the ﬂuctuations
become relatively small.

Now consider a more general variational statement than in Eq. (5.11),

we see that since we can change the source functions at will, and make very localized
changes, it makes sense to deﬁne the variational derivatives

in particular, correlation functions. Repeating this operation we get

(5.31)
The operators are multiplied in the order of the time development. The only place
where K−appears is in the latter part of the time development. See Fig.5.4.
The distinction between ± disappears if we now set K+ = K−:

Fig. 5.5 Time cycle with different forces, K+ and K−. on the forward and backward moving
segments. Now the initial time of the time cycle, t2, is different from the ﬁnal time of the time cycle,
t′
2, with τ = t′
2 −t2. It is assumed that the time t1 is later than both t2 and t′
2, and that the forces are
localized as shown
as before, Eq. (5.25).
We would like to use more general starting and ending states than the ground
state. We can obtain these by use of impulsive forces. It is convenient to deal with
all states at once, as in the generating function for p(n, 0)K considered above. Think
of a time cycle starting at time t2, advancing forward to time t1, during which time
the force K+ acts, then moving back in time to a time t′
2, under the inﬂuence of the
force K−—See Fig.5.5.
Let t′
2 = t2 + τ. This displacement injects energy information. Consider

which uses (no force acts between times t′
2 and t2)
⟨nt′

(5.35)
Analysis of this formula will yield individual transformation functions.
Now we must solve the dynamical equations subject to boundary conditions. Let
us compare tr⟨t′

2|y−(t′

Here, by introducing a complete set of states at the time of the operator, we have
expressed the formula in terms of the matrix elements of stationary operators.

Remarkably, we see that the two expressions are equal; in effect, there is a peri-
odicity present here:

as far as traces are concerned. Now, the equations of motion (4.65) for the operators
read

Exactly as before, we get an equation for the logarithm—looking at the previous
calculation leading to Eq. (5.16), we see an additional term, referring to the y+(t2)
boundary term in Eq. (5.40). The periodic boundary condition then gives

This holds identically in τ; in particular, in the limit where τ →−i∞, which
corresponds to absolute zero temperature, we recover ⟨0t2|0t2⟩K±.

Time-Cycle or Schwinger-Keldysh Formulation
Now consider a time cycle with displacement T : the system evolves from time t2
to time t1 under the inﬂuence of the force K+(t), and backwards in time from t1 to
t′
2 under the force K−(t):
K−(t) = K(t),
K+(t) = K(t + T ).
(5.53)
This is again as illustrated in Fig.5.5, with these replacements. What is the physical
meaning of this? Insert in Eq. (5.49) a complete set of states at time t1:
⟨nt2|nt2⟩K± =

n′
⟨nt2|n′t1⟩K−⟨n′t1|nt2⟩K+.
(5.54)
We did this before for the ground state. The effect is the same as moving the starting

Therefore,

We can rewrite the above generating function more conveniently, by multiplying

Chapter 6
Relativistic Theory of Fields
This section is an adaptation of Chap. 5 of lectures given at Stanford by Schwinger
in 1956 (Schwinger 1956).
A state of a physical system is deﬁned in terms of the maximum number of
compatible measurements which can be made upon the system. If the state were
deﬁned on a space-like surface (one in which all points are in space-like relation:
(x)2 −(t)2 > 0) then a measurement at any point is compatible with one made
at any other point, since the disturbances introduced by the measurements cannot
propagate faster than c, and hence cannot interfere. Thus, a state can be speciﬁed as an
eigenvector of a complete set of commuting, Hermitian operators a, associated with
a deﬁnite space-like surface σ : |a′, σ⟩. There always exists a coordinate system in
which the space-like surface σ is all of three-dimensional space at a given time; in
this particular Lorentz frame the state vector is just: |a′, t⟩. The problem of relativistic
dynamics is to ﬁnd the transformation function

where the χa(x) = χa(x, y, z, t) are the dynamical variables of the system, neces-
sarily Hermitian operators; the relativistic requirements automatically introduce the
concept of ﬁelds. The relativistic notation used has the form
x0 = t = −x0,

(6.6)
The action principle again states that for a given dynamical system, the variations
arise only from the end-point, that is,
δW12 = G1(σ1) −G2(σ2).
(6.7)
As before, from this requirement follow the equations of motion and the generators
of inﬁnitesimal transformations which yield the commutation relations of the ﬁeld
operators. The Lagrangian density L which will yield ﬁrst order ﬁeld equations is
L = 1

χ Aμ∂μχ −∂μχ Aμχ

−H (χ) ,
(6.8)
where the Aμ are a set of four numerical matrices, and space and time derivatives
appear on a symmetric basis. The symmetrization of the kinematical term relates
to the possibility of adding to L the relativistic analogue of our previous total time
derivative, a four dimensional divergence. If
L = L −∂μ f μ,

(6.11)
As before, the equation of motion is unchanged. Since L is to be Hermitian, we
require
Aμ† = −Aμ,
so H† = H
(6.12)
The rank of Aμ is that of the number of independent ﬁelds. Note that the variation
δ⟨a′
1σ1|a′′
2σ2⟩is independent of any coordinate system, since L is a Lorentz scalar.
We can now infer some fundamental properties from the requirement of invariance
of L. Consider the coordinate transformation (Poincaré transformation)
xμ = ℓμνxν −ℓμ
(6.13)
where
gμνℓμλℓνκ = gλκ,
ℓμλℓμκ = δλκ.
(6.14)
We can divide the transformations into two subsets by considering the effect of (6.13)
on g00,

(6.15)
Since ℓ00 = ∂x0
∂x0 it follows that we can never make a continuous change from a
positive to a negative sense of time, i.e., generate an improper transformation con-
tinuously. We shall consider only the group of continuous proper Lorentz transfor-
mations.
Under such a coordinate change, the ﬁelds χa(x) change to new ones χa(x)
connected by a real linear transformation:
χ (x) = Lχ(x).
(6.16)

Thus
LTAμL = ℓμν Aν,
H (Lχ) = H (χ) .
(6.18)
If we choose for H the special form
H = χ Bχ = χ LTBLχ,
(6.19)
where B is Hermitian and non-singular, then LT = BL−1B−1. From the ﬁrst of
Eq.(6.18), we then obtain
L−1 
B−1Aμ
L = ℓμν

B−1 Aν
,
(6.20)
showing that the combination B−1Aμ transforms like a vector; this is implied by the
required invariance of the kinematical term of L.
Consider now a general inhomogeneous inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation, of
the form
xμ = xμ −ϵμ + ϵμνxν,
(6.21)
where the ϵμ and ϵμν are inﬁnitesimals, and the rotational nature of the ϵμν is
expressed by the relations ϵμν = −ϵνμ. Then L can be written as L = 1+ i
2ϵμνSμν,
where only the rotational ϵμν terms appear, since the translations ϵμ do not effect the
gradient operators ∂ν, and no corresponding changes in the χα are required to keep
L invariant. The Sμν are (imaginary) operators, acting on the ﬁeld variable, which
will express the spin character of the ﬁelds.
The variation δWα allows us to change the ﬁeld components at each space-time
point (call these changes δαχα), and to change the region of integration by displacing
the boundary surfaces σ1 and σ2. In the previous non-relativistic treatment, instead of
varying the end-point times t1 and t2 ,we used t(τ). Proceeding similarly here, we can
express the variation of a space-like surface by varying the space-time coordinates
under an inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation (δxμ = ϵμ −ϵμνxν) so chosen that
on σ1 and σ2 the required displacement is obtained. The change in the action is

(6.23)
To re-write (6.23) we recognize that the total change in the ﬁelds is due to both the
δ0 variation of the ﬁelds at a given space-time point on σ, and also to the variation
induced by the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation of coordinates as σ is displaced
to σ + dσ; the latter is obtained from
χ (x) = Lχ(x) = χ(x) + i
2ϵμνSμνχ(x),
(6.24)
But
χ (x) = χ(x) −δxμ∂μχ(x),
(6.25)
and therefore
χ(x) −χ(x) = δxμ∂μχ(x) + i
2ϵμνSμνχ(x).
(6.26)

The right hand side of (6.26) is then the variation induced in the χα by the coordinate
transformation; the total variation of the ﬁelds is then
δχ(x) = δ0χ(x) + δxμ∂μχ(x) + i
2ϵμνSμνχ(x).

by the coordinate variation, and the other giving the variation induced by a change
in the ﬁeld variables,

Pν and J μν are the generators for translations and rotations, respectively, and their
commutation relations are determined by the group of transformations they represent.
Speciﬁcally, Pν isrecognizedasthe4-momentumoperator,and J μν astherelativistic
generalization of the angular momentum operator.
The ﬁeld equations are obtained by the vanishing of δ0L in (6.22),
2Aμ∂μχ = ∂ℓH

writing Gχ:
Gχ =

dσμχ Aμδχ,
or
Gχ = −

dσμδχ Aμχ.
(6.36)
If we continued with these two pairs of expressions,we would obtain two forms for
the commutation rules of χ; their equivalence then leads to the requirement that the
Aμ and χ must decompose:
χ = φ + ψ,
Aμ = aμ + sμ,
(6.37)
where the aμ are anti-symmetric and real, the sμ are symmetric and imaginary, and
the φ and ψ represent the kinematically independent ﬁelds of the Bose-Einstein and
Fermi-Dirac types, respectively. The ﬁeld equations are then
2aμ∂μφ = ∂ℓH

(6.40)
The ﬁrst of Eq.(6.40) combined with Eq.(6.38b) implies that H must be an even
function of ψ.
The ﬁeld equations may be written as equations of motion by singling out the
time differentiation,
2A0∂0χ = ∂ℓH
∂χ −2Ak∂kχ.
(6.41)
If we took A0 to be non-singular, we would be able to solve (6.41) for ∂0χ. More
generally, we now recognize the existence of the following possible situations:
1. A0 is non-singular. In this case, all of the variables are kinematically independent.
An example of this situation is the Dirac-Majorana spin- 1
2 ﬁeld.
2. A0 is singular, but there are enough relations among the variables to determine
all of them. Here, only those variables which possess equations of motion are
kinematically independent, but the non-independent ﬁelds are determined from
the independent ﬁelds. Examples of this are the spin zero and spin one ﬁelds.
3. A0 is singular, and there are not enough relations among the variables to deter-
mine all the ﬁelds, as in case 2. The classic example of this is the spin 1, zero
mass, electromagnetic ﬁeld, where the lack of determination corresponds to the
possibility of introducing a gauge transformation.
6.1 Inference of Particle Properties
We now consider the generators of inﬁnitesimal coordinate (Lorentz) transformations
Gk and the commutation relations they imply. From (6.33b) we have
Gx = ϵν Pν + 1
2ϵμν J μν,
(6.42)
which, when applied to the space-time coordinates xμ, generates the new xμ,
x′ = xμ −ϵμ + ϵμνxν,
(6.43)
which is Eq. (6.21). Accompanying this transformation, we have the apparent change
in the ﬁelds given by (6.26),
−δχ(x) = χ(x) −χ(x) = δxμ∂μχ(x) + i
2ϵμνSμνχ(x),

(6.45b)
From (6.45b) the identiﬁcation of Sμν with the intrinsic spin characteristics of the
particle is evident. Considering the time component (6.45a) we obtain the standard
commutator equation of motion

χ, P0
= −i∂0χ = i∂0χ = i ∂χ
∂t .
(6.46)
To determine the manner in which the particle interpretation enters, we now represent
the ﬁelds by Fourier integrals,
χ(x) =

(dp)eixμ pμχ(p),
(6.47)
where the χ(p) are operator functions of the numbers pμ. Substituting into (6.45a)
and equating coefﬁcients, we obtain

χ(p), Pν
= pνχ(p),
(6.48a)
or
Pνχ(p) = χ(p)

Pν −pν
.
(6.48b)
Since the 4 operators Pν all commute, we can have simultaneous eigenstates |P′⟩,
where Pν|p′⟩= Pν′|p′⟩. Applying (6.48a) to these states
Pνχ|p′⟩= χ

Pν′ −pν
|P′⟩=

Pν′ −pν
χ|P′⟩,
(6.49)
or writing χ|P′⟩as some new eigenvector |P′ −p⟩,
Pν|P′ −p⟩=

Pν′ −pν
|P′ −p⟩,
(6.50)
which shows that the effect of χ on |P′⟩is to produce a state whose momentum
eigenvalue has been changed by −pν, indicating the capacity of the ﬁeld to absorb
or emit pν. Speciﬁcally, considering the time component ν = 0, we have two possible
situations, depending on whether p0 is greater than or less than zero. If p0 > 0 ,
application of χ on |P′⟩yields a state with lower energy (P0′ −p0′), and conversely

72
6
Relativistic Theory of Fields
if p0 < 0. Since χ is Hermitian, χ can be split, in a Lorentz covariant way, into two
parts, χ = χ(+) + χ(−), where the superscripts indicate the positive and negative
nature of the p0 terms which enter in the respective Fourier transforms, and where
(χ(+))† = χ(−). Then χ(+) applied to a state of deﬁnite energy acts as an energy
annihilation operator, and χ(−) as an energy creation operator.
The χ(+) and χ(−) can then be used to create any physical state from the vacuum
state, where we take the latter as the unique lowest-energy state. This vacuum state
must necessarily correspond to the eigenvalue Pk′ = 0, (k = 1, 2, 3), since if
one of the Pk′ were not zero, a rotation of the coordinate system could yield three
non-zero momentum components, requiring (a super-position of) the corresponding
eigenvectors for its description. But this precludes a description of the vacuum by a
single non-degenerate state; we must therefore require that each Pk′ = 0. Since the
vacuum is to have the lowest energy possible, and we may arbitrarily take this to be
zero, we then characterize the vacuum state as that unique state for which Pμ′ = 0,
where χ(+)|0⟩= 0.
So far we have considered χ as representing general ﬁelds; to introduce particle
properties consider the Fourier transform of χ, and imagine the numbers pμ related
by the relation:
−pμ pμ = m2,
p0 = ±

m2 + p2.
(6.51)
Then χ(+), for example, remains an operator which annihilates energy, but now is
correlated with a momentum decrease. This is just the usual particle interpretation;
if χ(+) has this character it may be spoken of as a particle annihilation operator, and
conversely for χ(−).
6.2 The Connection Between Spin and Statistics
We consider the simplest system, corresponding to linear ﬁeld equations. Taking
H = χ Bχ, this becomes for our two types of ﬁelds H = φB(1)φ + ψ B(2)ψ, where
φ, ψ represent ﬁelds of the 1st and 2nd kinds, respectively, meaning bosonic and
fermionic ﬁelds. (Note that H must be even in ψ, and therefore, as noted below
Eq. (6.40), no term of the form φψ can occur.) The matrix B (and therefore B(1) and
B(2)) is Hermitian. Writing
δφH = δφB(1)φ + φB(1)δφ = δφ

B(1)φ + B(1)Tφ

,
(6.52)
and since
∂ℓH
∂φ = ∂rH
∂φ ,
(6.53)
for these variations of ﬁelds of the ﬁrst kind, both terms in the above bracket must
be equivalent, implying that B(1) = B(1)T. Since B(1) is also Hermitian, it is real.

6.2 The Connection Between Spin and Statistics
73
For δψ variations, the identical argument shows that B(2) = −B(2)T, i.e., B(2) is
imaginary. It is precisely here that the connection between spin and statistics arises:
We can construct matrices for B−1aμ only for particles of integral spin, and for
B−1sμ only when the particle spin is an integer plus one-half. [See Eq. (6.37).]
Writing the equations of motion (6.35) for either ﬁeld
2Aμ∂μχ = ∂ℓH
∂χ = 2Bχ,
(6.54)
and assuming—as the simplest case—that B is non-singular, we obtain
B−1Aμ∂μχ(x) = χ(x).
(6.55)
Going to the momentum representation χ(p) as before, this becomes
i B−1 Aμ pμχ(p) = χ(p).
(6.56)
Now consider the matrix (of ﬁnite order) i B−1 Aμ pμ ≡M, which must satisfy its
algebraic minimal characteristic equation Mn + a1Mn−1 + · · · + an = 0, where the
an are numbers. From Eq. (6.20) we know that L−1 
B−1Aμ
L = ℓμν

B−1Aν
. If
we insert the proper combinations L−1L in each term, and use the relation
L−1 
B−1Aμ pμ

L = B−1Aνℓμν pμ = B−1Aμ pν,
(6.57)
then the result of a Lorentz transformation, giving us back the identical minimal equa-
tion (as it must), shows that the a j are Lorentz invariants, or functions of invariants.
Since the only 4-vectors available are the pμ, we take a j = a j(−pμ pμ). Further-
more, the minimal equation must be valid independently of the value of the numbers
pμ, i.e., it must be an algebraic identity in pμ ; the coefﬁcients a j(−pμ pμ) must
then be of the form (−pμ pμ) j times a numerical factor c j, which is independent of
the pμ. We can identify the two possible cases, corresponding to the degree of the
minimal equation being either even (n = 2k) or odd (n = 2k + 1); in either case the
power to which (B−1 Aμ pμ) is raised must decrease in steps of two,
n = 2k :

Note also that the numbers c j must be real, since

and

B−1.
(6.59b)
Taking the adjoint of the minimal equation then corresponds to making a similarity
transformation on the matrices and complex conjugating every c j term. Since each
B can be combined with a B−1 term, and since we must still have the same unique
minimal equation, it follows that each c j = c∗
j. All of the above is a direct inference
from the requirement of Lorentz invariance.
If we now apply (6.58a) and (6.58b) to the ﬁeld χ(p), and use (6.56) we obtain

ing (6.65), each of a deﬁnite symmetry (to represent the γ μ and γ 5 = γ 0γ 1γ 2γ 3),

can be achieved in only one way: Three of the matrices must be symmetric, and the
remaining two antisymmetric. This statement, which is easily veriﬁed, together with
(6.62) shows that we can construct matrices satisfying (6.65) only for Fermi-DIrac
ﬁelds, as follows: Since αμ is real, and β imaginary, αμ = βγ μ = −βγ μ∗, i.e., all
the γ μ are imaginary. From (6.65) we note that

γ 02
= −g00 = +1

γ k2
= −gkk = −1.
(6.66)
Deﬁning γ μ = iμ where the μare then real, it follows that

We are looking for matrices of deﬁnite symmetry; equating j and ℓ, (6.67) can be
satisﬁed only if 0

nj = +k
jn; i.e., γ 0 is antisymmetric (and imag-
inary, and therefore Hermitian), and the three γ k. are symmetric (and imaginary,
and therefore skew-Hermitian). γ 5 is then antisymmetric and real. It then follows
that

β, γ k


β, γ 0
= 0, and since β and γ 0 have the same properties, we may
identify them: β = γ 0.
If we now attempt to repeat this for Bose-Einstein ﬁelds, then the αμ are anti-
symmetric and imaginary, β is symmetric and real, all the γ μ are the same as for the
Fermi-Dirac case, and again

β, γ k
= 0. But this is a direct violation of the require-
ments that there be but three independent symmetric matrices, satisfying (6.66).
Equation (6.65), from which the spin 1

to Fermi-Dirac ﬁelds.

More precisely, this is the Lagrangian for the uncharged Dirac-Majorana ﬁeld—in
order to represent charge we shall later have to double the number of components
of ψ. For notation, we introduce the use of the dot · to symbolize the proper sym-
metrization brackets to be used for Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein ﬁelds. Then
L = ψ·iαμ∂μψ −mψ·βψ.

6.4 Spin Zero and One
Let us return to the characteristic Eq.(6.58b) of the matrix

i B−1 Aμ pμ

. We will
choose k = 1, and examine the odd polynomial in

i B−1 Aμ pμ

, which gives the
possibility of describing a particle of zero mass. This is necessary to describe the
electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Deﬁne the four vector βμ ≡imB−1 Aμ. Then we have

3 + pν pν

βμ pμ

= 0,
or

βμβσβν + gμνβσ
pμ pσ pν = 0.
(6.76)
From this equation, which is an identity in pμ, we can make statements only about
the symmetric part of the matrix products. If we completely symmetrize the matrix
factor with respect to μ, σ, and ν, it must vanish. This is the sum of three terms of
the form
βμβσβν + βνβσβμ = −gμσβν −gνσβμ,
(6.77)

6.4 Spin Zero and One
77
which are the familiar Kemmer-Dufﬁn commutation relations (Petiau 1936; Dufﬁn
1938; Kemmer 1939) which are used to describe a particle of spin zero and one. All
the β matrices are singular. These matrices have 126 independent elements and hence
are reducible to three sub-matrices of dimensionality 10, 5, and l; the sub-matrix of
dimensionality 1 is trivially the null matrix; the one of dimensionality 5 and rank 2
describes a particle of spin 0; the matrix of dimensionality 10 and rank 6 describes
a particle of spin 1.
The Lagrangian can be written, by choosing B = m, as
L = φ·iβμ∂μφ −mφ·φ,

It eliminates the dependent components of φ from the commutation relations.

which is independent of time, and is the equation expressing the dependent compo-
nents of φ in terms of the independent components.
Let us re-examine the spin zero and spin one ﬁelds. Integral spin ﬁelds may be
described in terms of ordinary tensors. They do not require the special spinor proper-
ties of the half-integral spin ﬁelds. We have seen that the spin zero representation of
the Kenner-Dufﬁn algebra has a dimensionality of ﬁve. If the only tensor in addition
to the ﬁeld components which is introduced to form bilinear products in a scalar
Lagrangian is the four-divergence, we must describe the ﬁeld with tensors differing
in rank by one. We shall construct the spin zero ﬁeld with a scalar and four-vector
as the necessary 5 components, and the spin one ﬁeld with a four-vector and an
anti-symmetrical second rank tensor as representing the 10 components.

(6.85)
The ﬁeld equations are determined by varying φ and φμ,
∂μφμ = mφ,
∂μφ = mφμ,
(6.86)
which imply
∂μ∂μφ = m∂μφμ = m2φ,
∂μ∂μφν = 1
m ∂ν∂μ∂μφ = m2φν,
(6.87)
again yielding the Klein-Gordon equation.
The generator is

(6.88)
Thus only φ and φ0 are independent variables. This is reﬂected in the fact that the
Klein-Gordon equation is second order, and hence we must specify both the wave
function and its time derivative.
The equations of motion have to be examined to see if the other components of
the ﬁeld are determined. We have from the ﬁeld equations, as equations of motion,
∂0φ = mφ0
∂0φ0 = mφ −∂kφk,
(6.89)

6.5 Spin Zero
79
and the following which is not an equation of motion, but does show that the φk are
determined in terms of the two independent components,
∂kφ = mφk.
(6.90)
From the generator we see that we have one set of canonically conjugate variables,
φ and φ0. This means that the ﬁeld has only one internal degree of freedom, and
must be a spin zero ﬁeld. This pair of conjugate variables must obey the canonical
commutation relations (at equal times), as is easily veriﬁed by using the generators
for their respective change

6.6 Spin One
The description of a spin one ﬁeld requires the use of a ten-component wave function.
As we shall see, not all of these components are independent. We shall use a four-
vector and an anti-symmetrical tensor of rank two. The Lagrangian is chosen to
be

The factor of 1/2 in the last term is inserted because the unrestricted sum over μ and

∂μGμν = mφν.

(6.96)
Thus only six of the ten components can be varied independently, φk and G0k. Let
us see if they have equations of motion and if the other 4 components are determined
in terms of the independent ones. The equations of motion are
∂0φk = ∂kφ0 + mG0k,
∂0G0k = mφk −∂lGlk,
(6.97)
for the independent ﬁeld components. Also
∂kφℓ−∂ℓφk = mGkℓ,
mφ0 = ∂kGk0 = −∂kG0k,
(6.98)
which determine the four dependent ﬁeld components. Thus all ten components of
the ﬁeld are determined.
From the generator we see that we have 3 sets of canonically conjugate ﬁeld
variables; thus the ﬁeld has 3 internal degrees of freedom. This corresponds to the
three sub-states of a spin one ﬁeld.
The commutation relations obeyed by the ﬁeld components are obviously the

6.7 Electromagnetic Field
The electromagnetic ﬁeld is a spin one, massless ﬁeld. A re-deﬁnition of the ﬁeld
variables in the limit as the mass approaches zero will be made in the spin-one
Lagrangian. Set
√mGμν ≡Fμν,

√m φν ≡Aν.

Then the Lagrangian (6.94) becomes

(6.103)
The ﬁeld equations are

and the generator becomes, in the local coordinate system,
G =

dσ 1

AkδF0k −F0kδAk

.
(6.105)
Thus, as in the case of a spin one non-zero mass ﬁeld, only six of the ﬁeld components
can be varied independently. Their equations of motion are
∂0 Ak = ∂k A0 + F0k,
∂0F0k = −∂ℓFℓk.
(6.106)
We must now examine the rest of the ﬁeld equations to see if the dependent
components are determined,
∂k Aℓ−∂ℓAk = Fkℓ,
∂k F0k = 0.
(6.107)
Thus Fkl is determined, but because of the vanishing of the photon mass, A0 is not
determined and a further restriction is placed on the electric ﬁeld, F0k. This is exactly
the freedom of making a gauge transformation, which is allowed by the vanishing
of the photon mass. That is,
Aμ →Aμ + ∂μ.
(6.108)
It is convenient to split the vector part of Aμ into a longitudinal part, which is the
gradient of a scalar, and a transverse part, which is the curl of a vector. Thus we see
that the gauge transformation affects only the longitudinal part of Ak. F0k is purely
transverse because it has no divergence.

6.8 Introduction of Charge
83
6.8 Introduction of Charge
It was previously mentioned that the description of charge requires a doubling of the
number of component ﬁelds χ.
The simplest case to consider is the case of one internal degree of freedom. Calling
the two basic ﬁelds χ(1) and χ(2), L [Eq. (6.8)] becomes
L = χ(1)·Aμ∂μχ(1) + χ(2)·Aμ∂μχ(2) −H(χ(1), χ(2)).
(6.118)
Since both χ(1) and χ(2) have identical space-time properties, the kinematical portion
of L is invariant under rotations and reﬂections in a new two-dimensional space
composed of the components χ(1) and χ(2) in accordance with the sum-of-squares
notation of (6.118). The rotations in this space, given by
χ(1) = cos λχ(1) + sin λχ(2),
χ(2) = −sin λχ(1) + cos λχ(2),
(6.119)
may be concisely expressed as
χ = eiλqχ,
(6.120)
where
χ =
χ(1)
χ(2)

q =
0 −i
i 0

.
(6.121)
The basic improper transformation (reﬂections) can be taken either as
χ(1) = χ(2),
χ(2) = χ(1)
(6.122)
or
χ(1) = χ(2),
χ(2) = −χ(1).
(6.123)
Re-deﬁning Aμ as
Aμ 0

Aμ

,
(6.124)
allows us to write (6.118) in matrix notation
L = χ·Aμ∂μχ −H(χ),
(6.125)
where we have assumed that H has the required invariance under reﬂections and
rotations in this space. Use of (6.120) and qT = −q is then sufﬁcient to guarantee
the invariance of L under rotations. The reﬂection transformations in (6.122) can be
compactly written as
χ = Cei π
2 qχ
χ = Cχ,
(6.126)

84
6
Relativistic Theory of Fields
where
C =
0 1
1 0

(6.127)
Then the relations CT = C−1 = C show that L is invariant under reﬂections.
The proper transformation (6.120) can be evolved from a sequence of inﬁnitesimal
transformations of the form
χ = (1 + iδλq) χ = χ −δχ
δχ = −iδλqχ,
(6.128)
and incorporating this inﬁnitesimal variation into the action principle will yield a
quantity which is conserved. The notation will suggest the interpretation of this
quantity as electrical charge, but until the manner in which it appears in interactions
between the various ﬁelds is speciﬁed, the nature of this charge is irrelevant.
If we now imagine that δλ of (6.128) is a continuous function of space time, the
ﬁnite change in λ which builds up between an initial t(σ2) and ﬁnal t(σ1) times
corresponds to different successive choices of χ. The stipulated invariance of L then
implies that δλL = 0. If δλ were constant, δλL would vanish trivially, in accordance
with (6.120) and (6.126); we obtain something new since the dependence of δλ on
xμ introduces terms depending on ∂μδλ:
δλL = −iχ· Aμqχ∂μδλ ≡jμ∂μδλ = ∂μ

jμδλ

−δλ∂μ jμ,
(6.129)
where
jμ ≡−iχ· Aμqχ = −iχ Aμqχ = χ(2)Aμχ(1) −χ(1)Aμχ(2),
(6.130)
The action principle now requires that the coefﬁcient of δλ vanish, yielding the
differential conservation law
∂μ jμ = 0.
(6.131)
The term ∂μ [ jμδλ] gives the generator for changes on the boundary space-like
surfaces σ1. σ2. Taking δλ as constant over each surface, which corresponds to
different, but deﬁnite, choices of the χ on σ1,2, we have
Gλ = δλ

dσμ jμ ≡Qδλ.
(6.132)
Further, if δλ(σ1) = δλ(σ2) then it is obvious that we get the same description as we
would have obtained with δλ = 0 in both surfaces, i.e.,
[Q(σ2) −Q(σ1)] δλ = 0,
and therefore
Q(σ1) = Q(σ2).
(6.133)
This result also follows from (6.131); the quantity Q, called the “charge", is therefore
conserved.

6.8 Introduction of Charge
85
Obtaining the commutation relations, from (6.128) and (6.132) we have
δχ = 1
i [χ, G] = 1
i [χ, Qδλ] = −iqχδλ,
(6.134)
or
[χ, Q] = qχ,
(6.135a)
or

χ(1), Q

= −iχ(2),

χ(2), Q

= iχ(1).
(6.135b)
The generalization of (6.134) for a ﬁnite rotation is
e−iλQχeiλQ = eiλqχ,
(6.136)
which is analogous to translation induced by the momentum operator Pν,
[χ, Pν] = 1
i ∂νχ
e−iα·Pχ(x)eiα·P = eαν∂νχ(x) = χ(x + a).
(6.137)
There must also exist a unitary operator, in analogy with (6.136), which accom-
plishes the improper transformations of Eq.(6.123):
C−1χC = cχ,
or

C−1χ(1)C = χ(1)
C−1χ(2)C = −χ(2)
.
(6.138)
From (6.132) and (6.130) we then have
C−1QC = −Q.
(6.139)
Thus, C has the interpretation of a charge reﬂection operator. Since C2 = +1, its
eigenvalues are C = ±1. From (6.139) we see that [Q, C] ̸= 0 and the two opera-
tors cannot be simultaneously diagonalized, (in the representation of χ(1), χ(2), C is
diagonal) except for states of zero charge. If we arbitrarily assign the vacuum state
the eigenvalue C′ = +1 , then this state of zero charge, Q′ = 0, has both a deﬁnite
charge and charge symmetry.
To obtain a state (other than Q′ = 0 ) of deﬁnite charge, where the operator Q is
diagonalized, we must utilize non-Hermitian operators. Deﬁne
χ+ ≡χ(1) −iχ(2),
χ−= χ(1) + iχ(2),
(6.140)
and then a simple calculation shows that

χ+, Q

= χ+,

χ−, Q

= −χ−,
(6.141)

86
6
Relativistic Theory of Fields
indicating that in this representation Q is diagonal. However, C is no longer diagonal:
C−1χ±C = χ∓.
(6.142)
From (6.141) we see that if we have a state |Q′⟩representing a deﬁnite charge,
then
Q

χ+|Q′⟩

(6.143)
showing that χ+ creates a state for which the eigenvalue of Q is Q′−1, and conversely
for χ−These, then, represent charge annihilation and creation operators respectively.
If we imagine that every physical state can be created by the action of these operators
on the vacuum |Q′ = 0⟩then the only possible values of Q′ are 0, ±1, ±2, …etc.
(Note that charge annihilation represents the destruction of positive charge or the
creation of negative charge, and vice versa.) To connect this with our previous particle
description in Sect. 6.1, where we had χ(+) and χ(−), we now obviously have the
four possibilities:
• χ(+)

destroys a particle and decreases charge by 1,

creates a particle and increases charge by 1.

6.9 Quantum Electrodynamics
As an illustration of the use of non-Hermitian ﬁelds, we now consider the ordinary
charged Dirac ﬁeld. We start with ψ(1) and ψ(2) as the two 4-component Hermitian
ﬁelds which form the simplest charged ﬁeld. Let
ψ(1) −iψ(2) = ψ+ ≡ψ,
(6.148a)
ψ(1) + iψ(2) = ψ−≡ψ†.
(6.148b)
There is an artiﬁcial asymmetry here depending on what is deﬁned as ψ and ψ†. The
commutation rules are now

The current is then

the Lagrangian is

(6.153)
If we wish to interpret jμ as the electric current, we can write down the Lagrangian
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld plus the charged Dirac ﬁeld and specify the coupling
so that the usual ﬁeld equations arise, in which jμ acts as the source for the vector
potential. The form of the coupling term is of course limited by Lorentz invariance
and the spin 1
2 and spin 1 algebra. Thus the most general Lagrangian which can be
formed in this case is

The symmetrization between Aμ and jμ is necessary because in general, the sources
for the Aμ are partly the jμ and hence these need not commute. The last term, a
Pauli moment, even though it appears covariant, may, in fact, not be covariant due to
its operator properties. These show up only in higher order terms in the perturbation
expansion.
The Lagrangian given by Eq.(6.154) is invariant under the rotation and reﬂection
of χ(1) and χ(2), which correspond to the replacements
ψ →eiλ(x)ψ,
ψ →e−iλ(x)ψ,
Aμ →Aμ + 1
e ∂μλ(x),
(6.155)
and to the interchange of ψ and ψ, respectively. Note that in the second case—that
of reﬂection—we must also replace Aμ →−Aμ, Fμν →−Fμν, in order to have L
unaltered.
We obtain the equations of motion and generators by variations

in a local coordinate system. In this form, the independent variables appear to be
only ψ and the Ak. ψ is deﬁnitely an independent variable; its equation of motion
is Eq. (6.156a). To re-examine the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we write Eqs. (6.156c) and
(6.156d) as

6.9 Quantum Electrodynamics
89
∂0 Ak = ∂k A0 + F0k,
Fkℓ= ∂k Aℓ−∂ℓAk,
∂0Fk0 = jk −∂ℓFk0,
∂k F0k = j0.
(6.159)
Since we have the freedom of making a gauge transformation, wherein the longitu-
dinal components of Aμ are then arbitrary, it is advantageous to re-write equations
(6.159) in terms of transverse (T) and longitudinal (L) components:
(1) ∂0 AT
k = FT

(2) ∂0Fk0T = jkT −∂ℓFkℓ,

k = ∂k A0 + FL
0k,
(5) ∂0Fk0L = jkL,
(6) ∂k F0kL = j0.
(6.160)
Here, FL
0k ̸= 0 since the electric ﬁeld is no longer divergence-free. The solution of
item (6) is immediately
F0kL = −∂k

dσ (0)D(0)(x −x′) j0(x′),
(6.161)
demonstrating that the longitudinal part of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not a kine-
matically independent quantity, but depends on the j0 of all the charged particles
present. Note that item (5) is not an independent statement, since it is the result of
the conservation law for jμ(x). Since AL
k = ∂k(x), using item (5) shows that
A0 = ∂0(x) +

dσ ′D(0)(x −x′) j0(x′),
(6.162)
i.e., A0 is completely arbitrary, corresponding to the freedom of choice of (x).
The generator in Eq.(6.158) can now be written as

By the addition of a surface term, the last term in the integrand in (6.163) becomes
equal to = j0δ, which does not refer to the kinematically independent part of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, and gives the generator for the change in the Dirac ﬁeld when
aninﬁnitesimalgaugetransformationismade—SeeEq.(6.132).Theelectromagnetic
ﬁeld commutation rules are again as given in equations (6.113a) and (6.113b); the
anti-commutation relation for the Dirac ﬁelds works out to be

ψ(x), ψ(x′)

= γ 0δ(0)(x −x′) = −γ0δ(0)(x −x′) →−γμδ(μ)(x −x′). (6.164)
Using the non-Hermitian ψ, ψ, the effect of the charge reﬂection operator C is to
interchange the ﬁelds:
C−1ψC = ψ†,
C−1ψ†C = ψ.
(6.165)

Relativistic Theory of Fields
In order to maintain the invariance of L, we must now also require that this unitary
operator reverse the sign of the Aμ.
C−1AμC = −Aμ.
(6.166)
Again, C2 = +1, and therefore its eigenvalues are C = ±1. From the arguments of
the preceding section, use of the transformation:
C−1QC = −Q
(6.167)
permits a classiﬁcation, in terms of the quantum number c′, for systems of zero net
charge. For example, consider the production of photons by repeated application of
the operator A (actually A(−), a photon creation operator) to the vacuum state |0⟩,
characterized by c′ = +1, and assume that no coupling terms are present in L (i.e.,
e = 0). If A is applied n times to |0⟩then by (6.166)
C (A · · · A) |0⟩= (−1)n (A · · · A) |0⟩,
(6.168)
and we have a state |(A′ ··· A′)⟩whose eigenvalue of C depends on the (even or odd)
number of photons present: C′ = (−1)n = ±1. Whichever +1 or -1 eigenvalue of c′
we begin with persists as the coupling is turned on, even though what is now called
the state of n photons is a superposition of many different states.
As an example of this, let us consider the decay of positronium. In the absence of
the coupling term between Aμ and ψ (i.e., e = 0), the system of (e+ + e−) is stable,
and has a deﬁnite eigenvalue c′. When the coupling is introduced, the only permitted
ﬁnal states will be those of the same eigenvalue. From our previous interpretation,
ψ is the operator which creates a particle e−and annihilates e+, and conversely for
ψ†. To obtain a state with e−at x and e+ at x′, we form

ψ†(x)·ψ(x′)

|0⟩, and
recognize that the actual state is a superposition of these with the amplitude wave
function ψ(x, x′). Using (6.165) we then have
C|e+e−⟩= C
 
(dx)(dx′)ψ(x, x′)

ψ†(x)·ψ(x′)

|0⟩

|0⟩
= −
 
(dx)(dx′)ψ(x′, x)

ψ†(x)·ψ(x′)

|0⟩.
(6.169)
If the wave function ψ(x, x′) is symmetric, then c′ = −1; if ψ(x, x′) is anti-
symmetric, c′ = +1. As the coupling is now turned on, this no longer remains
the exact state, but the c′ value remains the same. Thus we have the selection rule
for positronium: from a 1S state it can decay only into an even number of photons
(c′ = +1, ψ(x, x′) is antisymmetric), from a 3S state it can decay only in to an odd
number of photons (c′ = −1, ψ(x, x′) is symmetric).

Chapter 7
Nonrelativistic Source Theory
The following is based on lectures given at Schwinger by Harvard in Spring 1969, as
transcribed by the author. The goal was to construct a general theory of particles, in
a nonrelativistic context. As such, this provides a transition between nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics and source theory, the general development of which was given
later in Schwinger’s three-volume treatise (Schwinger 1970b, 1973, 1989a).
The measurement symbol, or projection operator, which forms the basis for
Schwinger’s approach to quantum mechanics (Schwinger 2001),
|a′, b′| = |a′⟩⟨b′|
(7.1)
represents a idealized process in which the state b′ is annihilated and a new state a′
is produced. Wouldn’t it be useful to separate these processes? Recall how oscillator
states, as discussed in Chap.4, were created by forces. We generalize to sources which
can create and destroy particles. A scattering process, which occurs in a more or less
localized scattering region, can be abstracted into a two-stage process, in which ﬁrst
an incoming particle is absorbed, and then a new particle is created, as sketched
in Fig.7.1. In the individual processes the source K acts to create or annihilate the
particle.
What does this mean quantum mechanically? We must describe the processes
by probability amplitudes; we want to construct everything from the one particle
production mechanism,
⟨1p+|0−⟩K ,
⟨0+|1p−⟩K ,
(7.2)
where the ﬁrst amplitude represents the process in which a single particle state of
momentum p is created, where before the source acts only the vacuum state is present,
while the second represents the process in which a single particle of momentum p is
absorbed after which the vacuum state is present.
Because the processes occur in space and time, the source must be a function
K(r, t), which exhibits a certain degree of localizability. How does the effectiveness

of the source vary with different degrees of freedom? The complementary measure is
the corresponding function in momentum space K(p, E), where, nonrelativistically,
E = p2/(2m). We expect the relationship between the production amplitude and
the source function to be, at least for a weak source,
⟨1p+|0−⟩K =

(dp)
(2π)3 (−i)K(p).
(7.3)
Here (dp) = dp1dp2dp3. The −i factor is purely conventional for later convenience.
The square root of the momentum-space element is present to properly account for
the density of states in the continuum picture. To compute the annihilation amplitude
⟨0+|1p−⟩, we can use orthogonality, ⟨1p−|0−⟩= 0. This must be maintained by the
dynamics. The completeness relation

where we shall consider a weak source, so we will drop the higher terms. To lowest
order (in powers of the source)
⟨0+|0−⟩0 = 1,
⟨1p−|1p′+⟩0 = δpp′,

so

(7.9)
These equations, in fact, deﬁne what we mean by a source.
Now we need to seek the relation to the space-time description. What happens
when a source is displaced,
¯K(r, t) = K(r + R, t + T ).
(7.10)
Relativity (here Galilean) means that the same effect occurs by displacing the space-
time coordinate system to which the initial and ﬁnal states are referred, the generator
of such an inﬁnitesimal displacement being
G = P · δϵ −Hδt,
(7.11)
which implies that the displacement operator is
U = eiP·R−iHT .
(7.12)
Thus the 1 particle states change according to
⟨1p| →⟨1p|eiP·R−iHT = eip·R−iET ⟨1p|,
(7.13)
while the vacuum state is unchanged,
⟨0+| →⟨0+|.
(7.14)
Thus if the one particle amplitude is proportional to K(p),
⟨1p+|0−⟩K ∼K(p),
(7.15)
that of the displaced source is
⟨1p+|0−⟩¯K ∼eip·R−iET K(p) ∼¯K(p).
(7.16)
This implies that K(p) is obtained by Fourier transforming K(r, t),
K(p) = K(p, E) =

(dr)dte−ip·r+iEt K(r, t).

In general, one wants to remove the connection between E and p.
What about strong sources? Remember for the oscillator, the most basic object
was the ground-state persistence amplitude ⟨0+|0−⟩K . The latter contains the process
of the exchange of particles between temporally separated sources, as illustrated in
Fig.7.2. Here a single particle is emitted by source K2 and absorbed later by the
source K1. Before and after either source acts, the system is in the vacuum, no-
particle, state. We imagine the total source to be the sum of the two components,
K(x) = K1(x) + K2(x).
(7.18)
The decomposition shown is called a causal arrangement. Because we are so far
considering weak sources, when we insert a complete set of states at an intermediate
time between the action of the two sources, the vacuum persistence amplitude is
⟨0+|0−⟩K = ⟨0+|0−⟩K1⟨0+|0−⟩K2 +

But the source is a unitary whole—results can depend only on the total source K
and not its parts. This is a statement of the uniformity of space and time. This will
introduce terms that will refer to each component source separately; what we don’t
want is a term that involves K ∗
2 and K1; therefore, we deﬁne the retarded Green’s
function

Now we want to remove the restriction to weak sources. Suppose we have a beam
of noninteracting particles, detected for example by spatially separated sources, as
illustrated in Fig.7.3. Each particle is produced and detected by a single pair of weak
sources K (α), α = 1, 2, 3, . . . . There is no interaction between different pairs of
sources. Thus the vacuum persistence amplitude for this arrangement is

The description so far of the exchange of particles between sources is a sort of
action at a distance picture. We are often concerned with excitations produced by a
source—a more local description. A test source is used to measure effects. So let us
add an additional inﬁnitesimal source,

where T = −∇2/(2m) is the kinetic energy differential operator. Therefore, the ﬁeld
ψ satisﬁes

ψ(r, t) = K(r, t).
(7.44)
This is analogous to the equation satisﬁed by the harmonic oscillator variable (4.65),

Now because

which is the complex conjugate equation. The boundary conditions are different in
the two cases: ψ is a retarded solution, while ψ∗is an advanced solution.
What does W have to do with action? Let us write the alternative forms

That is, the stationary action principle, that W is unchanged under inﬁnitesimal ﬁeld
variations, supplies the equations of motion (7.44) and (7.47).
Fundamental to physics is the notion of the uniformity of space and time, that the
laws of physics are independent of the locale. This is reﬂected in the indistinguisha-
bility of identical particles, which, in turn, is reﬂected in the probability amplitude
of a source producing a multi-particle distribution, Eq. (7.33a), which says all that
is possible. Experimentally, we know of two kinds of statistics. Here np is unlim-
ited, so this cannot refer to Fermi-Dirac statistics. In the Bose-Einstein case we have
stimulated emission. Let us see this.
Figure7.5 shows the interchange of noninteracting particles between sources K2
and K1, but now with a weak source K0 in between. The total source is composed
of three causally separated pieces,
K = K1 + K0 + K2.
(7.52)

Therefore, for a weak source,

The corresponding probability of creating 1 more particle with momentum p is

which exhibits another characteristic of Bose-Einstein statistics. The ﬁeld ψ, the
generalization of the wavefunction, must be totally symmetric under interchange of
the particles.
7.1 Interactions
Real particles interact with each other. Thus we should have processes such as
sketched in Fig.7.7. The particles emitted by the sources are scattered by inter-
actions represented by the black box labeled T. Let us begin with a simpler situation,
scattering from a ﬁxed center, for example, a heavy nucleus. This process can be
represented with only two sources, as shown in Fig.7.8. This diagram schematically
represents the tracks of particles as seen in a detector. In the absence of interactions

(7.64)
where now we have used the superscript 0 to designate the free particle propagator
or Green’s function previously denoted simply by G. This process in represented
by the dotted line in Fig.7.8. Now we want to add something to this, the scattering
process, represented generically by T. From a source point of view, both processes
contribute to the vacuum amplitude

(7.66)
The vacuum persistence amplitude is expressed as
⟨0+|0−⟩= eiW
(7.67)
for the same reason as before. Because we have a well-deﬁned causal situation,
ψ0(1) =

G0(1 −1′)K(1′),
t1 > t1′,
(7.68)
we can write
ψ0(r, t) =

So, picking out the coefﬁcients of −iKp′, −iK ∗
p, we infer
⟨1p|1p′⟩= −i

ψp(1)T(1, 1′)ψp′(1′).
(7.73)
so if we knew T we could compute the scattering amplitude by taking matrix elements
in this way.
Let us analyze the scattering process in more detail, by going into processes which
occur in a deﬁnite time. That is, we break up the extended process, represented by the
black box in Fig.7.8 by viewing it as a repetition of elementary processes represented
by a potential V , as sketched in Fig.7.9. To describe this, we extend the idea of the
ﬁeld. The vacuum amplitude is given in terms of
W = −

K ∗[G0K + G0TG0K],
(7.74)

7.1 Interactions

where the quantity in square brackets is regarded as the ﬁeld,
ψ = ψ0 +

G0Tψ0,
(7.75)
where ψ0 =

G0K and Tψ0 may be thought of as an effective source. In this way
we get a superposition of effects. Alternatively, we may emphasize the last scattering
act,
ψ = ψ0 +

G0V ψ,
(7.76)
where, as above, ψ is due to an inﬁnite number of elementary scattering acts. This
decomposition is self-consistent, because we may write
ψ = ψ0 +

G0V ψ
= ψ0 +

G0V ψ0 +

G0V G0V ψ0 +

G0V G0V G0V ψ + . . . .
(7.77)
So if the expansion makes sense
T = V + V G0V + V G0V G0V + . . . .
(7.78)
The differential equation corresponding to Eq. (7.76) is

i ∂
∂t −T

ψ = K + V ψ,
(7.79)
or

i ∂
∂t −T −V

ψ = K.
(7.80)
So we see, indeed, that V is the potential energy. Thus, we indeed have a multiple
scattering process.
This also generalizes the concept of the Green’s function. If we write
ψ =

GK,
(7.81)
where the Green’s function satisﬁes

i ∂
∂t −T −V

G(1, 1′) = δ(1, 1′),
(7.82)
and the action can be written as

which in value is equal to

(7.84)
The Green’s functions include the possibility of bound states.
More generally, think of 2-particle scattering, represented in Fig.7.7. Single-
particle exchange is represented by
W2 = −

K ∗G0K.
(7.85)
But here, the particles do their thing, and the scattering is represented by
W4 = −1

(K ∗G0)1(K ∗G0)2T(12, 1′2′)(G0K)1′(G0K)2′.
(7.86)
Again, the scattering amplitude ⟨1p11p1|1p1′1p2′ ⟩is given simply in terms of T.
Moreover, we want to analyze the scattering in terms of elementary processes, as
sketched in Fig.7.10. The terms in the vacuum amplitude of interest are contained
in ei(W2+W4) which when expanded contains the following terms with four sources:

This says that the source detects what comes directly, and what comes from the

Now make explicit the time localization of the potential:
V (1, 2; 1′, 2′) = δ(t1 −t2)δ(t1′ −t2′)δ(t1 −t1′)V12(r1 −r2, r1′ −r2′).
(7.92)
It might also be that the potential is localized in space:
V12(r1 −r2, r1′ −r2′) = δ((r1 −r2) −(r1′ −r2′))V (r1 −r2),
(7.93)
but we won’t assume this in the following. Then the Green’s function deﬁned by
ψ(1, 2) =

(iG0G0) = δ(t −t′)δ(r1 −r′

iG = δ(t −t′)δ(r1 −r′

which is what we would expect.
Now we write the vacuum amplitude as

where in the last three-particle and higher interactions have been omitted. Here we
include in the second term only the effects of interaction, through
χ(1, 2) = ψ(1, 2) −ψ(1)ψ(2).
(7.102)
The integral equation (7.96) written in terms of the last interaction can also be
written in term of the ﬁrst interaction,
G = G0G0 + GiV G0G0.
(7.103)
Symbolically we can solve for G,

1 −iV G0G0 ,
(7.104)

7.1 Interactions

which are formally identical. This assumes the instantaneous interaction given by
Eq. (7.92). Let us write
G0G0 = −iG0
1+2,
iG = G1+2;
(7.105)
then our integral equation reads
G1+2 = G0
1+2 + G0
1+2V12G1+2.
(7.106)
which satisﬁes the differential equation (7.100), or

i ∂


G1+2 = δ(t −t′)δ(r1 −r1′)δ(r2 −r2′).
(7.107)
We might be interested in non-instantaneous initial and ﬁnal states, even though
we are assuming an instantaneous interaction. Then we could write
G = iG0(t> −t<)G12(t< −t′
>)G0(t′
> −t′
<),
(7.108)
where
G0(t −t′) →−iδ(r −r′) as t →t′ + 0,
(7.109)
hence the factor of i is supplied by comparison with the instantaneous limit, t1 = t2,
t′
1 = t′
2.
7.2 Bound States
Sources must be able to create composite structures. We could have started with
composite particles, after all, so this is a aspect of self-consistency. Write the integral
equation for G symmetrically,
G = G0G0 + G0G0iV [G0G0 + GiV G0G0] = G0G0 + G0G0iV G0G0
+ G0G0iV GiV G0G0.
(7.110)
We are still working with the instantaneous interaction approximation. So G has the
property of depending on two times. Write again
G = −iG1+2,
V →V12.
(7.111)
The description of the bound states is contained in G1+2. The part of the vacuum
amplitude involving G1+2 is

This involves all interactions.
Now introduce the coordinates for the two-particle system, where we assume that
the two particles have the same mass,
R = 1
2(r1 + r2),
r = r1 −r2.
(7.113)
The Green’s function equation (7.107) becomes

i ∂
∂t −P2
2M −p2
2μ −V (r)

G(r, R, t; r′, R′, t′) = δ(t −t)δ(r −r′)δ(R −R′),
(7.114)
where we see the appearance of the total mass M, the reduced mass μ, the total
momentum P and the relative momentum p. We are interested in the motion of the
center of mass. Let the internal motion be described by an eigenfunction φk governed
by a Schrödinger equation,

Ek −p2
2μ −V

φk(r) = 0,
(7.115)
so multiplying Eq. (7.114) by φ∗
n(r) and integrating over r we obtain

2M −En
 
(dr)φ∗(r)G(r, R, t; r′, R′, t′)
= δ(t −t′)δ(R −R′)φ∗(r′).
(7.116)
The Green’s function can be expanded, therefore, in terms of a single-particle Green’s
functions depending on the state n:
G(r, R, t; r′, R′, t′) =

n
φn(r)Gn(R −R′, t −t′)φ∗
n(r′).
(7.117)
Now from Eq. (7.112) we identify the effective source for an atomic state
Kn(R, t) =

(7.118)
We must be very explicit that En < 0, meaning that the sources are extended: They
must put out less energy than two free particles would have. So G0 does not refer to
the propagation of a free particle, but rather it propagates an excitation which does

not get very far. As a result, the Green’s functions become real in effect, by virtue of
the integration, and

Perhaps this remark is clariﬁed by looking at the Fourier transform of the free
Green’s function,

E −T + iϵ .

When E < 0 there is no singularity and the Green’s function is real.
The formalism is ﬂexible: it can deal with bound states whether analyzed or not,
which is especially useful in high energy physics.

thus
χ = GiV ψψ.
(7.126)
If we use these equations to evaluate W we recover the previous result (7.112).
We have here two independent ﬁeld ψ and χ, coupled by interaction. This is the
essence of the many-particle situation in high energy physics. Essentially, we may
regard the −1
2χ∗V ψψ as a phenomenological coupling between particles.
This nonrelativistic development of source theory was written down after the rela-
tivistic formulation was developed, which is explicated in great detail in Schwinger’s
three volume treatise (Schwinger 1989a).

Concluding Remarks
We have traced Schwinger’s development of action formulations from classical sys-
tems of particles and ﬁelds, to the description of quantum dynamics through the
Quantum Action Principle. In the latter, we have described quantum mechanical sys-
tems, especially the driven harmonic oscillator. This is ahistorical, since Schwinger
ﬁrst developed his quantum dynamical principle in the context of quantum electro-
dynamics in the early 1950s, and only nearly a decade later applied it to quantum
mechanics, which is ﬁeld theory in one dimension—time. At roughly the same time
he was thinking about quantum statistical systems (Martin 1959), and it was natural
to turn to a description of nonequilibrium systems, which was the motivation of the
time-cycle method, although Schwinger put it in a general, although simpliﬁed, con-
text. The time cycle method was immediately applied to quantum ﬁeld theory by his
students, K. T. Mahanthappa and P. M. Bakshi (Mahanthappa 1962; Bakshi 1963).
Then we give a sketch of the application of these methods to quantum ﬁeld theory,
based on Schwinger’s 1956 Stanford lectures, and to what Schwinger perceived as the
successor to ﬁeld theory, Source Theory. The latter appeared shortly after he received
his Nobel prize in 1963. In fact the present document, which includes components
of Julian Schwinger’s thinking over nearly four decades, shows that these develop-
ments proceeding organically, and that the action principle and Green’s functions1
played central roles throughout his remarkable career in physics. In fact, it has been
argued (Mehra 2000) that the ﬁrst “source theory” paper was in fact his most cited
one, written in 1951 (Schwinger 1951a).
1One of Schwinger’s last publications (Schwinger 1993) described the centrality of Green’s func-
tions to his life work.
