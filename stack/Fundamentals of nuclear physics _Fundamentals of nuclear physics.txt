Preface
This book provides an introduction to nuclear physics. Research in nuclear physics
covers a wide variety of subjects, and one can list many key words: nuclear
structure and reactions of stable and unstable nuclei, ﬁssion and decay of a nucleus,
extreme states such as the limits of existence and high-spin states, properties at high
temperature and high density, hypernuclei, neutron stars, and nucleosynthesis,
among others. All of these are the subjects of nuclear physics. In addition to these
rather static properties, nuclear reactions such as heavy-ion collisions introduce new
aspects of research, i.e., dynamical properties of nuclei or reaction mechanisms,
such as heavy-ion fusion reactions, dissipation phenomena and liquid–gas phase
transition. Many of these phenomena can be understood from the point of view that
a nucleus is a quantum many-body system of nucleons stabilized by nuclear force.
On the other hand, phenomena at higher energies, driven by, e.g., high-energy
heavy-ion collisions, require a different approach: the approach based on the
quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The study of quark–gluon plasma and of the
QCD phase diagram is representative and forms a large stream of current nuclear
physics.
In this book, we largely restrict our subjects and describe basic features of
nuclear structure and of nuclear decays. b-decay and most excitation motions are
left to other books. Also, nuclear reactions and current subjects such as physics of
unstable nuclei, hypernuclei, and nuclear physics based on QCD are untouched
except for occasional very brief references. Even with these limitations, we could
only brieﬂy mention recent developments. However, we have tried to convey part
of them through columns on the QCD phase diagram of nuclear matter, superheavy
elements, superdeformed states, and overview of the synthesis of elements. We
hope that together with the main text they help readers to grasp our current
knowledge of the nucleus and some recent research trends in nuclear physics. By
restricting the subjects, our aim was to contain many experimental data of basic
nuclear properties or suitable illustrations and explain the main structural features of
nuclei in some detail. This will be useful because most of the phenomena listed in
the ﬁrst paragraph, but omitted from the book, are intimately related to those
basic properties. We also have attempted to explain how the nuclear model has
vii

developed from the original phenomenological level of a shell model to the modern
understanding based on a many-body theory such as the Hartree–Fock calculations.
We also have described nuclear force, the basis of nuclear physics, in some detail.
We sometimes introduce semi-classical approximation to the original quantum
mechanical formalism. We hope that it helps the readers to intuitively grasp the
underlying physics of complicated nuclear phenomena.
In writing the book our intention was to create not only a good introduction to
nuclear physics, but also a good reference book for physicists to learn the appli-
cation of quantum mechanics and mathematics. Toward that aim, in addition to
describing the basic phenomena of a nucleus, we attempted to convey how the basic
subjects of modern physics such as quantum mechanics, statistical physics, math-
ematics for physics, e.g., complex integrals, are used to describe or interpret various
phenomena of nucleus. We also considered the standard level of knowledge of
junior and senior students, and gave a detailed description to enable them to derive
each equation. Finally, we added the appendix to prove a number of important
formulae in the main text and to show some fundamental formulae.
The contents of the book are based on the lectures that one of the authors, N.T.,
has delivered at Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, for a long time to junior and
senior students in the undergraduate physics course and also to beginning graduate
students. We have included as sidebars some additional material that was presented
in the class in order to keep the atmosphere of the lecture. Many textbooks and
original papers and ﬁgures therein have helped in preparing the lectures and this
book. Several of the ﬁgures are taken from them. Using this opportunity, we wish to
thank the authors. The papers cited at various places are not at all complete.
Moreover, it does not mean that they are necessarily the representative papers on
each citation. Nevertheless, we hope that they can help readers to do further study.
This book is an English translation of the Japanese edition, which one of the
authors, N.T., published in 2013. The appendix contains the errata to the original
Japanese edition.

Introduction
Abstract It would be useful to have an overview of some fundamental aspects of
nuclei before discussing each subject in detail. In this connection, we brieﬂy describe
in this chapter the constituents and basic structure of atomic nuclei, properties of
particles which are closely related to nuclear physics, the role of the four fundamental
forces in nature in nuclear physics, nuclear species, the abundance of elements and
the phase diagram of nuclear matter.
1.1
The Constituents and Basic Structure of Atomic Nuclei
The atomic nuclei are self-bound many-body systems of protons (p) and neutrons (n)
by strong interaction. Although other baryons such as Δ(1232) are also contained,
their amounts are small. For example, the percentage of Δ(1232)Δ(1232) contained
in the lightest nucleus deuteron (d) is about 1%. π-mesons in virtual states mediate the
interaction between the constituent particles and affect the electromagnetic properties
of protons and neutrons. Furthermore, each proton and neutron is also a composite
particle consisting of three quarks. The other hadrons also consist of quarks. One can
therefore take also the view that atomic nuclei are many-body systems of quarks.
The picture of nuclei and of nuclear phenomena, hence the appropriate way to
describe them, depend on the object and method of observation and the related
energy scale, and lead to various models for nuclei. This book restricts to low-
energy phenomena and discusses the nuclear structure and properties primarily from
the point of view that nuclei are many-body systems of protons and neutrons. The
governing law is quantum mechanics. This contrasts to quantum chromodynamics
for high-energy phenomena. Among various quantum many-body systems, nuclei
have characteristics that the number of constituents is small and also that the leading
forces are strong interactions.
Each nucleus is represented, for example, as 16
8O. O is the symbol of the chemical
element. It represents oxygen in this example, hence the number of protons is 8.
This number is called the atomic number, and is given at the left lower side. It is
often omitted, because it has a one to one correspondence to the symbol of element.
The number at the left upper side is called mass number and is given by the sum

The enclosing circle has been drawn to indicate the ﬁniteness of the nuclear size. In
reality, it is absent, because nuclei are not given by any external boundary conditions,
but are self-bound systems. The arrows indicate that protons p and neutrons n inside a
nucleus are not ﬁxed at lattice points like atoms in solids, but are moving around with
ﬁnite velocities. We learn later that nuclei behave like either liquid or gas depending
on the observables or phenomena we are interested in.
1.2
Properties of Particles Relevant to Nuclear Physics
Table1.1 gives the properties of particles which are closely related to this book. As
the table shows, proton and neutron resemble each other in many properties such as
the mass and the spin except for electric properties, and are jointly called nucleons.
In order to distinguish them, one introduces the concept of isospin space related to
charge, and considers proton and neutron to be two different states in the isospin
space. The operators and states in the isospin space obey the same law as that of
angular momentum, and are called isospin operators and isospin states, respectively.
Nucleon has two states in the isospin space. Similarly to the spin operators for
electron ˆs, one therefore introduces the isospin operators ˆt by

As Table1.1 shows, theisospinis oneof theimportant quantum numbers tospecify
the property of each particle. Its magnitude is assigned to be I when there exist 2I + 1
particles which have common properties for all aspects such as the mass and spin
but the electric charge. For example, the isospin of π-mesons is 1, since there exist
three particles which differ only in the electric charge. In nuclei, the isospin quantum
number of each state and the symmetry concerning the isospin play important roles
reﬂecting the symmetry properties of nuclear force in the isospin space.
If a particle is a structureless fermion, one can deduce from the Dirac equation
that its magnetic dipole moment, which is often simply called magnetic moment,
is given by μ = eℏ/2mc, where m is the mass of the particle. In fact, the magnetic
moment of an electron is 1in units of the Bohr magneton μB = eℏ/2mec.2 However,
Table1.1 shows that the magnetic moment of a proton signiﬁcantly deviates from the
nuclear magneton μN = eℏ/2mpc. Also, the magnetic moment of a neutron is not
zero, but is nearly comparable in magnitude and opposite in sign to that of a proton.
They are called anomalous magnetic moments and imply that both the proton and
the neutron are composite particles with intrinsic structure.3
Exercise 1.1 Derive the approximate equation for two large components ϕ in the
four-component spinor ψ starting from the Dirac equation in the presence of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds and assuming that the velocity v of the particle is much smaller
than the speed of light in vacuum c, i.e., v ≪c, and show that the term which
describes the interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld in the effective Hamiltonian is given
by H = −eℏ
2mcσ · B, where B is the magnetic ﬁeld. One can thus prove that the
magnetic moment of a Dirac particle is given by eℏ/2mc.
The fact that both proton and neutron are not point particles, but have intrinsic
structure, can be seen also directly from the data of charge distribution. The radius
of the charge distribution of a proton is about 1fm.4
1There exists an alternative deﬁnition, where proton and neutron are inverted such that |p⟩= | 1
2
1
2⟩,
|n⟩= | 1
2 −1
2⟩. Since N ≥Z for most stable nuclei, we adopt the Deﬁnition (1.3) in this book.
2Precisely speaking, the experimental value of the magnetic moment of an electron is larger than the
prediction of the Dirac theory by about 0.1%, and can be explained by quantum electrodynamics.
3It is Otto Stern who experimentally determined the magnetic moment of a proton for the ﬁrst
time. There remains an episode that Pauli visited Stern while he was conducting the experiment
and denied the signiﬁcance of the experiment based on the Dirac theory. Despite the criticism,
Stern continued his experiment, and discovered the anomalous magnetic moment of a proton, and
consequently was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943.
4Recent experiments of the scattering of high-energy electrons, and also of polarized electrons, are
shedding new lights on the intrinsic structure of nucleons. For example, it is getting uncovered that
the electric and magnetic charge distributions are different.

1.2 Properties of Particles Relevant to Nuclear Physics

The anomalous magnetic moments of nucleons can be understood by either the
meson theory or the quark model. The latter will be explained in Sect.5.4.3. Here,
we learn the former.
Let us assume that the proton observed in experiments is a superposition of a
bare proton as a structureless Dirac particle and a bare neutron as a Dirac particle
surrounded by a virtual π+-meson (the left part of Fig.1.2),
|p ↑) =

1 −Cp|p ↑⟩+

Cp|(n × π+) ↑⟩.
(1.4)
Since the π-meson is a pseudoscalar particle, the orbit of the π-meson around the
neutron is p-orbit. Corresponding to Eq. (1.4), the magnetic moment of a proton will
be given by
μp = (1 −Cp)μN + Cp
eℏ
2mπc .
(1.5)
The ﬁrst and the second terms on the right-hand side represent the contribution of
the interaction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with a bare proton and with π-meson,
respectively. Because of the difference between the masses of a nucleon and a π-
meson, one can explain the anomalous magnetic moment of a proton by assuming
the admixture of the (neutron×π+-meson)-component in a proton to be about 30%.
Similarly, if one assumes that a neutron is not a genuine Dirac particle, but contains
the component, where π−-meson is moving around a proton as a Dirac particle, by
Cn in proportion (the right part of Fig.1.2), one obtains
μn = Cn

μN −
eℏ
2mπc

(1.6)
for the magnetic moment of a neutron. Assuming Cp = Cn, one obtains
μp + μn = μN .
(1.7)
This agrees well with the experimental data (μp + μn)exp ∼0.88μN.

Introduction
1.3
The Role of Various Forces
It is known that four types of forces exist in nature. In this section, we brieﬂy survey
the role of four forces in nuclear physics.
The strong interaction is principally responsible for the stability and the struc-
ture of nuclei. The electromagnetic interaction provides a powerful probe of nuclear
structure through the electron scattering from nuclei as well as electromagnetic tran-
sitions and moments thanks to its well understood nature and the weakness of the
force. Furthermore, it governs the lifetime of excited states of nuclei through the
electromagnetic transition by γ -ray emission. The weak interaction governs the sta-
bility of nuclei through β±-decay. The representative example is the beta decay of
neutron (Fig.1.3), which is given by
n →p + e−+ ¯νe .
(1.8)
As shown in Table1.1, the mean life of the neutron in free space is τ ∼14.8 min,
and the corresponding half-life is T1/2 ∼10.2 min. The weak interaction plays an
important role also in the synthesis of elements beyond Fe.
Exercise 1.2 Explain the reason why the third particle besides the proton and the
electron is needed in the ﬁnal state of the β-decay of the neutron. Also, discuss the
properties of that particle.
All of the strong, the electromagnetic and the weak interactions are relevant to
the decay of nuclei. Though there are a large variety of decays, the time scale of the
lifetime associated with them is of the order of 10−21 s, 1 ps = 10−12 s, and 1min,
respectively, reﬂecting the difference among their strengths.
The gravitational force plays almost no role in the structure of nuclei. However,
it plays a crucial role in the synthesis of elements. Also, as we learn later, although
there exists no stable nucleus of dineutrons, there exist neutron stars because of the
gravitational force.

Useful Physical Quantities
It is sometimes worth making order-of-magnitude estimates of various physical quan-
tities. In that connection. it is useful to remember the following approximate values
related to the fundamental physical constants c (the speed of light in vacuum), ℏ(the
Planck constant divided by 2π), e (electron charge magnitude), kB (the Boltzmann
constant) as
c = 2.99792458 × 108 m/s ≈3.00 × 108 m/s,

(ﬁne structure constant),
(1.11)
kBT = 0.02482 eV ≈1
40 eV at T = 288 K.
(1.12)
The quantity e2/ℏc is called the ﬁne structure constant. Equation (1.11) holds when
the proportional coefﬁcient in the static electric force between two particles with
electric charge q1, q2 is determined such that the force is given by F(r) = q1q2/r2
when the two particles are apart from each other by the distance r. Equation (1.12)
represents the kinetic energy of thermal neutrons. It is useful to convert the temper-
ature given in units of Kelvin to the corresponding energy in units of MeV.
Exercise 1.3 The range of force is given by the Compton wave length ℏ/mc of the
corresponding gauge particle. Estimate the range of the strong interaction and of the
weak interaction.
Exercise 1.4 As Fig.1.4 shows, the force between two protons is dominated by a
repulsive Coulomb interaction at large distances, and turns attractive in the region
inside their touching radius due to the nuclear force, i.e., due to the strong interac-
tion. Estimate the height of the Coulomb barrier VCB = V (rB) by assuming that the
touching radius is given by r = rB ∼2 × Rp ∼2 fm, where Rp is the radius of the
proton.
Exercise 1.5 The temperature of the Sun at the core is about 16 million K. Estimate
the collision energy E at the core of the Sun.

Introduction
Nuclear reactions in the Sun occur very slowly, because they take place by quan-
tum tunneling as indicated by Exercises1.4 and 1.5. In reality, there exists another
important hindrance factor. As we learn later, there exists no stable bound state in the
diproton system. The only stable dinucleon system is deuteron consisting of one pro-
ton and one neutron. In order for the fusion of two protons to take place, the inverse
reaction of Eq. (1.8), where a proton is converted into a neutron by weak interaction,
must therefore be involved. Because of the superposition of the quantum tunneling
and weak interaction, the nuclear reaction between two protons is doubly hindered.
Consequently, the Sun burns very slowly. It has burnt already for 4.6 billion years
and is expected to continue to shine for another almost same period.
1.5
Species of Nuclei
The display of nuclei on the two-dimensional plane, where one axis, say the abscissa,
represents the neutron number and the other, say the ordinate, the proton number, is
called Nuclear chart or Segré chart. There are 256 stable nuclei if one includes those
nuclei which have long lifetimes of the order comparable to the lifetime of the Sun
such as U. They lie in the vicinity of the diagonal line of the nuclear chart for the
reason we learn later. The reason why there exist more stable nuclei than the number
of stable elements about 92in nature is because there exist about three stable nuclei
for each element on average. For example, there exist two stable nuclei, called proton
p and deuteron d, for the element hydrogen.
Incidentally, the nuclei which have the same number of protons (i.e., the same
atomic number), but differ in the neutron number, hence in the mass number as well,
are called isotopes to each other, and those whose neutron numbers are the same,
but the proton numbers are different, the isotones, and those which have same mass
numbers the isobars, respectively.
The study of unstable nuclei with short lifetimes is currently one of the hot subjects
of nuclear physics. If one includes unstable nuclei whose lifetime is longer than 1µs,
about 7000 nuclei are theoretically predicted to exist, among which about 3000 nuclei
have already been discovered experimentally. Also, a group of nuclei stabilized by
shell effects (see Chap.5) are predicted to exist in the region far beyond U. They
are called superheavy nuclei or superheavy elements, on which extensive studies are
going on both experimentally and theoretically.

This book deals with nuclei made from the ﬁrst-generation quarks, i.e., u and d
quarks, from the point of view of the quark model. In recent years, however, nuclei
containing Λ or Σ or Ξ particles, which include one or two second-generation s
quark (s) as constituents, are also under extensive studies. These novel nuclei are
called hypernuclei. A big progress of their study is expected to be stimulated by
the operation of, e.g., J-PARC. Figure1.5 shows the ordinary nuclear chart, while

number. The numbers appearing in Fig.1.5 are the magic numbers, which we learn
in Chap.5.
To end this chapter, we mention the abundance of elements. Figure1.7 shows the
relative abundance of elements5 in the conventional unit, i.e., by taking the abundance

of Si to be 106, i.e., H(Si) = 106. The hydrogen dominates by far, and the general
trend is that the abundance sharply decreases with increasing mass number up to
A ∼100, then decreases much more slowly. In addition, it is noticeable that there
appears a sharp peak of Fe group and that the abundances of nuclei with particular
neutron numbers are large. Also, one notices that each of the latter abundances
has twin peaks. These features originate from the stability of nuclei, and the magic
numbers, and the way of nucleosynthesis. We will gradually learn them in this book.

Water changes its state from ice (solid phase) to water (liquid phase), then to vapour (gas
phase) when the temperature and the pressure vary. Similarly, nuclear matter changes its state
or phase with temperature and density.
Figure1.8 conceptually represents the phase diagram of nuclear matter from the point of
view of QCD by taking the temperature and the chemical potential, which corresponds to the
baryon density, for the ordinate and the abscissa, respectively. The region marked as nuclear
matter is the state of nucleus treated in detail in this book.
As the ﬁgure shows, it is conjectured that a phase of quark–gluon plasma is achieved
irrespective of the density if the temperature becomes high. Related experimental as well as
theoretical studies are extensively performed including the high-energy heavy-ion collisions
(Au+Au) using the RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) at the Brookhaven National Lab-
oratory (BNL) in USA, and the Pb+Pb Collision experiments by the Large Hadron Collider
(LHC) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The stars and the arrows
in the diagram indicate the regions expected to be achieved by collision experiments and the
expected paths of time evolution, respectively. There still remain, however, many uncertainties,
including the phase diagram itself, and studies from various aspects are under way.

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
Abstract Theirsizesandmassesarethemostfundamentalpropertiesofnuclei.They
have simple mass number dependences which suggest that the nucleus behaves like a
liquid and lead to the liquid-drop model for the nucleus. In this chapter we learn these
bulk properties of nuclei and their applications to discussing nuclear stability, muon-
catalysed fusion and the structure of heavy stars. As an example of the applications
we discuss somewhat in detail the basic features of ﬁssion and nuclear reactors. We
also mention deviations from what are expected from the liquid-drop model which
suggest the pairing correlation and shell effects. We also discuss the velocity and the
density distributions of nucleons inside a nucleus.

Rutherford Scattering
At the beginning of the twentieth century when quantum mechanics was born, various
models were proposed for the structure of atoms such as the plum pudding or raisin
bread model of J.J. Thompson, which assumes that the plus charge distributes over
whole atom together with electrons, and the Saturn model by Hantaro Nagaoka.
Rutherford led these debates to conclusion through the study of scattering of alpha
particles on atom. He proposed the existence of a central part of the atom, i.e., the
core part, which bears all the positive charge that cancels out the total negative charge
of electrons and also carries the dominant part of the mass of the atom. Rutherford
named this core part nucleus, and gave the limiting value to its size.1 At that time,
Rutherfordhadbeenengagedinthedetailedstudiesofthepropertiesofalphaparticles
emitted from radioactive materials, and knew that the alpha particle is the ionized
He. What Rutherford remarked in the experimental results of Marsden is that alpha
1It was 1911 when Rutherford submitted his article on the atomic model to a science journal.
The idea and the formula of Rutherford were derived by stimulation of experimental results of his
coworker Marsden who had been engaged in the study of scattering of alpha particles emitted from

of the Rutherford scattering
and differential cross section
particles passing through matter sometimes make a large angle scattering, although
most of them go nearly straight. This experimental feature cannot be explained by
the Thompson model which assumes that positive charges distribute over the whole
atom.2
It is established today that alpha particle is the nucleus of He. Here, we learn how
the Rutherford model for atom was born, and how the information on the nuclear
size is obtained through the scattering experiments of alpha particles.
Let us now consider the scattering of two structureless charged particles by
Coulomb interaction, which is called Coulomb scattering or Rutherford scattering.
Here, the two charged particles represent the alpha particle and the nucleus of the tar-
get atom. Since the mass of electrons is extremely small, one can ignore the scattering
by electrons. The correct expression of the differential cross section for the Coulomb
scattering can be obtained by classical mechanics, although, correctly speaking, one
should use quantum mechanics. One important thing in this connection is that one to
one correspondence holds between the impact parameter b and the scattering angle θ
as illustrated in Fig.2.1. The alpha particles which pass the area 2πbdb of the impact
parameter between b and b + db in Fig.2.1 are scattered to the region of solid angle
dΩ = 2π sin θdθ around the scattering angle θ. On the other hand, the differential
cross section is deﬁned as the number of particles scattered to the region of solid
angle dΩ when there exists one incident particle per unit time and unit area. Hence

where the index R in σR means the Rutherford scattering. In Eq. (2.3), μ is the reduced
mass, and v is the speed of the relative motion in the asymptotic region, i.e., at the
beginning of scattering. Note that Eq. (2.4) exactly agrees with the formula of the
differential cross section dσR/dΩ obtained quantum mechanically for the Rutherford
scattering. The characteristics of the Coulomb scattering given by Eq. (2.4) are that
the forward scattering is strong, but also that backward scattering takes place with a
certain probability as well. These match the experimental results of Marsden.
The ground state of the natural radioactive nucleus 210
84 Po decays with the half-life
of 138.4 days by emitting an alpha particle (210
84 Po →206
82 Pb + α). The kinetic energy
of the alpha particle is about 5.3MeV corresponding to the Q-value of the decay
5.4MeV. The differential cross section for the scattering, where this α particle is used
to bombard the Au target of atomic number 79, agrees with that for the Rutherford
scattering right up to the backward angle θ = π. This suggests that the sum of the
radii of Au and α (R(Au) + R(α)) is smaller than the distance of closest approach
d(θ = π) for the scattering with the impact parameter b = 0 leading to the backward
scattering θ = 180◦in the case of Rutherford scattering. Since the distance of closest
approach d and the scattering angle θ or the impact parameter b is related by

boundary of the radius as R(Au) + R(α) < 4.3 × 10−12 cm. This upper boundary is
much smaller than the radii of atoms, which are of the order of 10−8 cm. Rutherford
was thus guided to his atomic model.
Figure2.2 shows the ratio of the experimental differential cross section for the
scatteringofα particlesof48.2MeVbyPbtargettothatforthecorrespondingRuther-
ford scattering dσR/dΩ as a function of the scattering angle. The experimental cross
section gets rapidly smaller than that of the Rutherford scattering beyond θ = 30◦.
This can be understood as the consequence of that the distance of closest approach
is small for the scattering corresponding to large angle scattering as Eq. (2.5) shows,
and hence the overlap between α particle and Pb becomes large, and consequently,
those phenomena such as inelastic scattering which are excluded in the Rutherford
scattering take place. Figure2.3 shows classical trajectories obtained by ﬁxing Pb
at the origin and by making the incident energy of α particles to 48.2MeV so as
to match with Fig.2.2. The circle shows the region corresponding to the sum of the
radii of Pb and α particle, i.e., about 9.1 fm. The ﬁgure conﬁrms that the distance of
closest approach for the trajectories corresponding to large angle scattering becomes
indeed smaller than the sum of the radii of Pb and α particle.

Exercise 2.1 Estimate the sum of the radii of α and Pb from the result of Fig.2.2
based on the idea mentioned above.
The ratio of the differential cross section shown in Fig.2.2 resembles the Fresnel
diffraction of classical optics. The Fresnel diffraction occurs in the case where the
source of light is located in the vicinity of the object that causes diffraction, e.g., an
absorber. The scattering of α particles by a nucleus with large atomic number behaves
like a Fresnel scattering, because the large Coulomb repulsion strongly bends the
trajectory and works to make the source of light effectively locate in the vicinity
of the scatterer. It is also because the partial waves corresponding to small impact
parameters whose distance of closest approach is small are removed from the elastic
scattering due to, e.g., inelastic scattering. Concerning the elastic scattering, this
plays effectively the same role as that of an absorber.
This picture holds when the Coulomb interaction dominates the scattering process.
The strength of the Coulomb interaction increases in proportion to the product of
the charges of the projectile and target nuclei. On the other hand, roughly speaking,

2.1 Nuclear Sizes
17
the strength of the nuclear interaction increases in proportion to the reduced mass
A1A2/(A1 + A2). Hence the refraction effect due to the nuclear interaction becomes
non-negligible for the scattering by a target nucleus with small atomic number. In
fact, a similar differential cross section appears not by diffraction effect, but by
refraction effect. The interpretation and analysis then get complicated. Accordingly,
one can safely estimate the nuclear size based on the consideration of the Coulomb
trajectory together with the strong absorption due to inelastic scattering as described
in the present section when the atomic number of the target nucleus is large.
2.1.2
Electron Scattering
The scattering of α particles by a nucleus had led to the Rutherford atomic model,
and provided a way to estimate the nuclear size. It thus played an important historical
role. However, as stated at the end of the last section, it has a limitation regarding
applicability. In contrast, the scattering of electrons by a nucleus, which we learn in
this section, is a powerful method to study the nuclear size, more exactly, the dis-
tribution of protons inside a nucleus, because only well understood electromagnetic
force is involved.3,4
2.1.2.1
The de Broglie Wavelength of Electron
In the experiments of electron scattering, electrons are injected on the target nucleus
after they are accelerated by, e.g., a linear accelerator. In order to deduce the infor-
mation on the nuclear size from electron scattering, the de Broglie wavelength of the
electron must be of the same order of magnitude as that of the nuclear size or smaller.
In this connection, let us ﬁrst study the relation between the de Broglie wavelength
of electron and the kinetic energy of electron supplied by the accelerator.
The de Broglie wavelength of electron λe is given by
λe = h
pe
(2.6)
in terms of the momentum of the electron pe and the Planck constant h. On the other
hand, it holds that
Etotal =

m2ec4 + p2ec2 = mec2 + Ekin = mec2 + Ee
(2.7)
3R. Hofstadter was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1961 for the study of high energy electron
scattering with linear accelerator and the discovery of the structure of nucleon. He performed also
systematic studies of nuclei by electron scattering.
4The electron scattering is a powerful method to learn the structure of nucleons mentioned in
Chap.1, and also to study nuclear excitations such as giant resonances and hypernuclei as well.

the wavelength itself, but the quantity which is obtained by dividing the wavelength
by 2π to facilitate the estimate of the order of magnitude.
Table2.1 gives the de Broglie wavelength of electron estimated by Eq. (2.9) for
some representative acceleration energies.
2.1.2.2
Form Factor
As Table2.1 shows, one has to inject electrons on a nucleus after having accelerated
them to much higher energy than the rest energy of electron mec2 ≈0.51MeV in
order to learn the nuclear size, which is of the order of fm. Hence one needs to use the
Dirac equation, to which a relativistic Fermi particle obeys, in order to theoretically
derive the proper expression of the differential cross section [3].
Exercise 2.2 Evaluate the ratio v/c of the velocity of the electron v to the speed of
light in the vacuum c when the acceleration energy of the electron Ee is 100 MeV.
However, here let us simplify the problem in the following way, and learn how the
information on nuclei can be obtained from the analyses of the electron scattering:
1. Treat the scattering of electrons by the electromagnetic ﬁeld made by a nucleus,
instead of considering the scattering of electrons by the nucleons inside the
nucleus.
2. Consider only the Coulomb force (electric force) and ignore the magnetic force.
3. Use non-relativistic Schrödinger equation.
We express the Coulomb potential as V (r). The scattering amplitude to the angle θ
is then given by


e−iq·rV (r)dr
(2.10)
following the ﬁrst order Born approximation, which is valid because of the high
energy scattering, and also because the involved electric force is weak compared to
the kinetic energy. The μ is the reduced mass. It can be identiﬁed with the mass of
electron me to a high degree of accuracy. The q is the momentum transfer divided
by ℏand is given by
q = kf −ki ,
(2.11)
q = |q| = 2k sin(θ/2) .
(2.12)
where ki is the wave-vector of the incident electron, kf is the wave-vector of the
electron scattered to the direction of angle θ and k is the wave number of the electron
corresponding to the incident energy.
Exercise 2.3 Derive Eqs. (2.10)–(2.12).
We remark that the potential V (r) obeys the following Poisson equation,
ΔV = 4π Ze2ρC(r) ,
(2.13)
in order to relate the scattering amplitude to the distribution of protons inside a
nucleus. The Z is the atomic number of the nucleus to be studied, and ρC(r) is
the charge density at the position r measured from the center of the nucleus.5 It is
normalized as

ρC(r)dr = 1 .
(2.14)
By repeating the integration by parts twice in Eq. (2.10), and by using Eq. (2.13), we
obtain,
f (1)(θ) = Ze2

(2.15)
where F(q) is deﬁned as
F(q) ≡

(2.16)
The differential cross section is therefore given by
dσ (1)
dΩ

(2.17)
5The distribution of protons ρp can be derived from ρC by taking into account the intrinsic structure

by replacing the differential cross section of the Rutherford scattering dσR/dΩ by
that for the Mott scattering dσM/dΩ which takes into account relativistic effects
for electrons. The dσM/dΩ gives the differential cross section of the scattering of
electrons by the Coulomb force made by a point charge. Equation (2.18) shows that
the information on the density distribution of protons inside a nucleus can be obtained
through the ratio of the experimental differential cross section to that for the Mott
scattering. The F(q) deﬁned by Eq. (2.16) is the factor which represents the effects
of the ﬁniteness of the nuclear size and is called the form factor.
Especially, if the nucleus is spherical, i.e., if the charge distribution is spherical,
the form factor is given by

1. Perform directly the integration over the angular part of r (dΩr) in Eq. (2.16).
2. Expand at ﬁrst the e−iq·r in terms of Legendre functions, and then use the ortho-
normal property of the spherical harmonics.
2.1.2.3
Density Distribution
(1) Estimate of the Nuclear Radius from Diffraction Pattern As Table2.1 implies,
the experiments of electron scattering are performed with high energy in order to
study nuclear size and the density distribution of protons inside a nucleus. The cor-
responding differential cross section is expected to show a diffraction pattern similar
to that of the Fraunhofer diffraction in optics. Figure2.4 shows the differential cross
section for the elastic scattering of electrons from Au target at 153 and 183MeV. The
monotonically decreasing solid line is the Mott scattering cross section for 183MeV.
The ﬁgure shows that the observed cross section is smaller than that for the Mott scat-
tering, and that it has indeed the diffraction pattern, i.e., oscillation, of the Fraunhofer
type.

2.1 Nuclear Sizes
21

and 183MeV. Taken from [4]
Let us assume that the charge distributes uniformly inside a nucleus with a spher-
ical shape of radius R in order to see how the nuclear size is estimated from the
diffraction pattern. The resulting form factor reads
F(q) =
3
q R j1(q R) =
3
q R (q R)−2[sin(q R) −(q R) cos(q R)] .
(2.21)
We then ﬁnd that the zeros of j1(x)/x correspond to the angles where the differen-
tial cross section shows local minima. We denote the magnitude of the transferred
momenta corresponding to those scattering angles θ1, θ2, . . . by q1, q2, . . .. The ﬁrst
zero of j1(x)/x is x1 ≈4.49, and the interval between the successive zeros Δx is
about π afterwards. One can therefore estimate the radius either by R ∼x1/q1 or by
R ∼π/(q2 −q1) using the q1, q2, . . . evaluated from θ1, θ2, . . ., which are extracted
from the experimental data.
Exercise 2.5 Estimate the radius of the nucleus of Au from the experimental data
shown in Fig.2.4.6
6The dips in diffraction pattern are buried by the distortion effects due to Coulomb force in the case
of target nuclei with a large mass number such as Au. The diffraction pattern appears more clearly
for the target nuclei with small mass number.

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
(2) The Woods–Saxon Representation of the Density Distribution Accurate infor-
mation on the density distribution7 of nucleons inside a nucleus can be obtained
by making the Fourier transformation of the form factor given by the experiments
of electron scattering. However, one usually takes the method to ﬁrst postulate a
plausible functional form, then determine the parameters therein to reproduce the
experimental data. In that case, a widely adopted choice is to assume the following
functional form called the Woods–Saxon type,8
ρ(r) =
ρ0
1 + e(r−R)/a ,
(2.22)
where R is the parameter to represent the radius. a is the parameter to represent the
thickness of the surface area and is called the surface diffuseness parameter. The
density falls from 90 to 10% of the central density over the region of thickness of
4.4 times a around R. The ρ0 is the central density, and is given as a function of R
and a through the normalization condition,

ρdr ∼ρ0

(2.23)
The two solid curves in Fig.2.4 which reproduce fairly well the experimental
differential cross section have been calculated with the best ﬁt parameters for the data
at 183MeV by assuming the Woods–Saxon representation for the charge distribution.
The following values are obtained from the analyses of experimental data for a
large number of stable target nuclei,
R ∼(1.1–1.2)A1/3 fm ,
a ∼0.6 fm ,
ρ0 ∼(0.14–0.17) fm−3 ,
(2.24)
as parameters in the Woods–Saxon parametrization.9 The fact that the radius is
proportional to the 1/3 power of the mass number, i.e., the number of nucleons
composing the nucleus, and that the density is independent of the mass number
7In stable nuclei, the protons and neutrons distribute inside the nucleus almost in the same way.
Here, we therefore treat the density distribution of protons and of nucleons as the same except for the
absolute value. In these days, extensive studies are performed on the nuclei far from the β-stability
line, which are called unstable nuclei. It is then getting known that some of them have very different
distributions for protons and for neutrons. For example, the region where there exists only neutrons
largely extends over the surface region in some nuclei such as 11Li in the vicinity of the neutron
drip line. Such layer is called the neutron halo. Recently, it is reported from the inelastic scattering
of polarized protons (see [5]) and also from the elastic scattering of polarized electrons that even
a typical stable nucleus 208Pb has a larger radius of the neutron distribution than that of the proton
distribution by 0.15–0.33fm. Relatedly, the study of the existence of the region consisting of only
neutrons, which is called neutron skin, is an active area of research.
8There exist deviations from the Woods–Saxon type for individual nucleus. They are explained by
shell model.
9The value ρ0 ∼0.17 fm−3 is widely accepted as the density of nuclear matter (see [6] for the
argument about the detailed mass number dependence of the central density of nuclei with large
mass number).

2.1 Nuclear Sizes
23
suggest that the nucleus has a property as a liquid.10 The fact that the density is
independent of the mass number is called the saturation property of nuclear density.
Incidentally, the surface area dominates in light nuclei. The Gaussian type is
therefore often used, instead of the Woods–Saxon type, as a more realistic functional
form.
2.1.2.4
The Root-Mean-Square Radius
The radius of a nucleus is the average of the radii of the region of spatial occupation of
the nucleons composing the nucleus. Hence the concept of root-mean-square radius
is often used in discussing nuclear size. We ﬁrst deﬁne the mean-square radius by

r2
≡
 ∞
0
r2ρ(r)4πr2dr
 ∞
0
ρ(r)4πr2dr .
(2.25)
The root-mean-square radius Rr.m.s. is then deﬁned by taking the square root as
Rr.m.s. ≡

⟨r2⟩.
We assumed a sharp density distribution without a surface diffuseness, i.e., a step
function, in a simple analysis of the diffraction pattern of the electron scattering,
e.g., as shown in Eq. (2.21). We name the resulting radius the equivalent radius or
the effective sharp radius and designate it as Req. By deﬁnition, Rr.m.s. and Req are
related to each other as
Req =

5
3⟨r2⟩=

5
3 Rr.m.s. .
(2.26)
Since Req is proportional to the 1/3 power of the mass number A, let us represent it
as
Req = r0 A1/3 .
(2.27)
The proportional coefﬁcient r0, called radius parameter, is then independent of
individual nucleus, and takes experimentally the value11 of
r0 ∼1.1–1.2 fm .
(2.28)
10Although the nucleus appears like a drop of liquid, it is not a classical liquid, but a drop of quantum
liquid, since commutation relations govern the nucleus. In the classical liquid, the momentum space
is not deformed even if it is spatially deformed. On the other hand, in the case of nuclei, a spatial
deformation leads to the deformation in the momentum space through the uncertainty relation (see
the footnote concerning quantum liquid in Sect.8.3.4).
11Equations (2.24), (2.27) and (2.28) hold for stable nuclei. It has been found that the radii of
unstable nuclei, especially of nuclei in the vicinity of neutron drip line, signiﬁcantly deviate from
these equations. For example, in the case of Li isotopes, the radius of 11Li which has a neutron halo
as mentioned before and thus called a halo nucleus or a neutron halo nucleus is much larger than
what we expect from Eq. (2.27), although the radii of stable isotopes 6,7Li and of the isotopes 8,9Li
which lie close to the stability line vary with A almost following Eq. (2.27).

(2.30)
for small values of the momentum transfer. These formulae show that the nuclear
size can be estimated by studying the form factor for the forward scattering or the
behaviour of the form factor in the region of small momentum transfer. Figure2.5
shows a similar analysis for the radius of proton. It is derived from the analy-
sis of this experimental data that the root-mean-square radius of proton Rr.m.s. is
0.7–0.8fm.12,13
12The measurement with high accuracy in the extreme forward region, where q2 is extremely small,
is a difﬁcult task and is a challenging subject in these days. In practice, one estimates the radius by
analysing the data in the region where the measurement with high accuracy is doable, by assuming,
e.g., the exponential or the Gaussian density distribution as shown in Fig.2.5. Also, it is known that
it is necessary to take into account the magnetic effects for the case of nucleons.
13As Fig.2.5 shows, the experimental data for the region of small momentum transfer can be
reproduced equally well by assuming the charge distribution in a proton to be either exponential or
Gaussian type. Historically, the charge distribution of exponential type has been considered to be a
good approximation, and correspondingly, the form factor of dipole type has been used. However, it
is getting known from recent studies that the experimental data signiﬁcantly deviate from the form
factor of the dipole type, and it is argued that the charge distribution inside a proton is closer to a
Gaussian type.

2.1.3
Mass Distribution
All the methods mentioned above are the method to study the distribution of protons,
in other words, the charge distribution in nuclei, and give no information on the
distributionofneutrons.Onehastouseothermethodsinordertostudythedistribution
of nucleons including neutrons, which is often called the mass distribution, inside
a nucleus. The scattering of protons or neutrons by a nucleus, where the strong
interaction is involved, and nucleus-nucleus collisions are the examples. Similarly
to the case of electron scattering, high incident energies are appropriate. Here we
consider two methods.
2.1.3.1
High-Energy Neutron Scattering: Fraunhofer Scattering
Let us ﬁrst consider the high-energy neutron scattering. Since the interaction between
theneutronandthetargetnucleusisstrong,neutronsareabsorbedorthetargetnucleus
is excited when the neutrons reach the area of the target nucleus. The associated cross
section, i.e., the sum of the cross sections of inelastic scattering and of absorption, is
intuitively expected to be given by σ (inel) ∼π R2 by using the nuclear radius R. On
the other hand, in the scattering of relatively high energy by a short range interaction,
the elastic scattering corresponds to the shadow scattering in quantum mechanics and
the magnitude of its cross section is also expected to be the same, i.e., σ (el) ∼π R2.
In consequence, the total cross section is given by σ (total) ∼2π R2. One can therefore
obtain the information on nuclear size by measuring the cross section of high-energy
neutron scattering.
In order to make the arguments more precise, let us consider the partial wave
analysis of neutron scattering by a nucleus, and postulate that the S-matrix of the
elastic scattering of each partial wave ℓis given by
S(el) =

0 for ℓ≤kR
1 for ℓ> kR ,
(2.31)
14The pair nuclei such as 15
7 N8 and 15
8 O7 which have interchanged numbers of protons and neutrons
are called mirror nuclei to each other. Their energy levels are nearly equal, but shifted.

26

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
by emphasizing the above mentioned absorption effects and the characteristic of
high-energy scattering that the phase shift is small. By inserting the extreme postulate
Eq. (2.31) called the sharp-cut-off-model into the partial wave expansion formulae,
Eqs. (A.6), (A.8) and (A.10), for the total cross sections of elastic scattering σ (el) and
of inelastic scattering σ (inel) and for the total cross section σ (total) = σ (el) + σ (inel), or
into their integral representations transformed to the form of Poisson sum formula
(see Eq. (A.23)), we can conﬁrm that σ (el) ∼π R2, σ (inel) ∼π R2, σ (total) ∼2π R2.
Experimentally, the total scattering cross section σ (total) can be determined rel-
atively easily by the attenuation method. In this method, the information on the
cross section is obtained by comparing the counts, which are observed with detec-
tors placed in the forward direction, in the measurements with and without scatterer.
If we represent the former and the latter as I and I0, respectively, then it holds that
I
I0
= exp (−σ (total)nt) ,
(2.32)
where n is the number density of the target nucleus inside the scatterer, and t the
thickness of the scatterer.
Incidentally, the scattering where the S-matrix is given by Eq. (2.31) corresponds
to the Fraunhofer diffraction in classical optics. A semi-classical scattering theory
leads to the following concise analytic expression for the associated differential cross
section of the elastic scattering,
dσ
dΩ = R2
1
θ sin θ |J1(kRθ)|2 .
(2.33)
The property of the Bessel function J1(x) suggests that the elastic scattering has large
intensities at forward angles. This is nothing but the shadow scattering mentioned at
the beginning of this section.
Another important thing is that an oscillatory diffraction pattern is observed. The
interval between two successive angles, where the cross section takes local maxima,
is given by ΔθD ∼π/kR from the property of the Bessel function. Hence one can
deduce a value for the nuclear size from the angular spacing of the diffraction pattern.
The validity of the Fraunhofer diffraction method described in this section can be
assessed by comparing thus obtained nuclear radius with the nuclear radius obtained
from the measurement of the total cross section.
One can also use a high-energy proton–nucleus scattering to study the mass distri-
bution. However, the simple model given by Eq. (2.31) cannot be applied in that case
because of the long range Coulomb interaction. In fact, the cross section diverges in
the Coulomb scattering. A special consideration is therefore required to handle the
scattering by Coulomb interaction.

Analysis of High-Energy Nucleon–Nucleus
and Nucleus–Nucleus Reaction Cross Sections
by Glauber Theory
The high-energy potential scattering can be well described by the eikonal approxi-
mation, where the scattering phase shift is determined based on the assumption that
the reaction takes place along a straight line trajectory. If one applies this idea to
the nucleon–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus scatterings, and takes the folding model,
where the potential in the eikonal approximation is approximated by folding interac-
tions between either incident nucleon or incident nucleus and constituent nucleons
in the target nucleus, then one obtains the following expressions
σR = 2π

which give the total reaction cross section σR in terms of the total reaction cross
section of the nucleon–nucleon scattering (see Appendix A.4.2). The ¯σN N in the
transparency function T (b) is the average of the total cross section in the proton–
neutron and proton–proton scatterings. If one denotes the collision energy in the
nucleon–nucleonscatteringby E(N N)

and the mass number of the projectile nucleus by AP, then one should use the energy
given by the relationship
E(N N)

lab /AP ,
(2.37)
(the reasoning is given in Appendix A.4.2). The Ov(b) is called the overlap function.
It is given by integrating the overlap of the densities of the incident nucleus (or
incident nucleon) and of the target nucleus for the impact parameter b over the
collision direction (named z-direction) which is perpendicular to b. The R = (b, z)
is the relative coordinate between the projectile and target nuclei. Since the overlap
integral clearly depends on the nuclear size and the distribution of nucleons inside
nuclei, one can extract information on those quantities from the analysis of the
reaction cross section based on Eq. (2.34).
Equations (2.34)–(2.37) are called the optical limit formulae of the Glauber theory,
whose derivation is given in Appendix A.4.2. It is necessary to extend them either by
taking into account higher order terms in the so-called cumulant expansion method
or by using the diffractive eikonal approximation which goes beyond the optical limit
approximation in order to correctly estimate the size and the reaction cross section
of the nuclei in the vicinity of the drip line, whose studies are recently extensively
going on, by analyzing their scattering data in terms of the Glauber theory (see, e.g.,
[8–10]).

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
2.2
Number Density and Fermi Momentum of Nucleons
2.2.1
Number Density of Nucleons
Let us denote the number density of nucleons inside a nucleus by ρ. Since ρ is deﬁned
as the mass number A divided by the volume V , we have
ρ ≡A
V =
3
4πr3
0
(2.38)
from Eq. (2.27) for spherical nuclei. As Eq. (2.28) shows, the radius parameter r0 is
almost constant independently of the mass number. Equation (2.38) therefore shows
that the number density of nucleons inside a nucleus is almost constant independently
of individual nucleus. This property is called the density saturation, and is one of the
experimental evidences of the liquid-like behaviour of nuclei leading to the liquid-
drop model of nucleus.
2.2.2
Fermi Momentum: Fermi-Gas Model, Thomas–Fermi
Approximation
One of the simple pictures for the nucleus as a many-body system of nucleons, which
are fermions, is the so-called Fermi-gas model or Thomas–Fermi approximation. In
that method, each nucleon is considered to be moving independently from each other
in a mean ﬁeld of volume V . However, the Pauli exclusion principle that each quan-
tum state can be occupied by at most only one fermion is respected. Consequently,
the nucleons become to distribute from the state of minimum momentum to that of
the highest momentum called the Fermi momentum. Since there exists one quantum
state for each volume (2πℏ)3 in the phase space, it holds
A =

if we represent the Fermi momentum as pF = ℏkF. The last factor 2 × 2 is the sta-

kF =

(2.40)
by using Eq. (2.27). Similarly to the density, the Fermi momentum also does not
depend on the mass number. The Fermi wave number is proportional to the 1/3
power of the density as one can expect from the consideration of their dimensions.

values of r0. The table shows that the speed of nucleons in the nucleus is at most 30%
of the speed of light in vacuum. It is the reason why we adopt the non-relativistic
theory to describe nuclei in most part of this book.15

Sidebar 1: Why don’t stars collapse? It looks puzzling that stars do not collapse
despite the fact that the attractive gravitational forces are acting between the con-
stituent particles. This is because the collapse is prevented by the degeneracy pressure
of electrons and of other constituent particles in the star. As stated in the main text, all
the fermions cannot occupy the smallest momentum state due to the Pauli exclusion
principle. Instead, they distribute up to the Fermi surface with high momentum. The
resulting pressure of the quantum mechanical origin, i.e., due to the Pauli exclusion
principle, is the degeneracy pressure. The Fermi momentum increases and hence the
degeneracy pressure increases if the volume of a star decreases by starting collapse. It
is why stars do not collapse so easily. On the contrary, if the density of fermions such
as electrons inside a star decreases for some reason, then the star starts to collapse
because of the break-down of the balance between the attraction by the gravitational
force and the degeneracy pressure. For example, a supernova explosion is initiated
by the electron capture as we will describe in Sect.2.3.

fying the energy E with the total kinetic energy of electrons. Note that particles with

of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions are also actively going on based on that point of view.
The relativistic treatment has the advantage that the spin of nucleons is naturally introduced. In this
book, we only touch the general framework of the relativistic mean-ﬁeld theory in Sect.6.3.

smaller mass work more effectively, i.e., give larger contribution, to the degeneracy
pressure if the number densities of different particles are the same as Eq. (2.41)
shows.
Sidebar 2: Why don’t atoms collapse? A similar question arises for the size of
atoms. Let us consider the neutral hydrogen atom as the example. The attractive
Coulomb force acts between the proton and the electron in the hydrogen atom. The
corresponding potential energy is given by V (r) = VC(r) = −e2/r when they are
separated by the distance r. It therefore looks energetically most stable at r = 0, i.e.,
when the proton and the electron stick to each other. Nonetheless, the size of the
Hydrogen atom is known to be the Bohr radius given by aB = 0.5 × 10−8 cm, which
is larger than the radius of proton Rp ∼0.8 × 10−13 cm by 5 orders of magnitude.
This is also a consequence of quantum mechanics. The world of quantum mechanics,
i.e., the microscopic world, is governed by the uncertainty principle ΔxαΔpα ≳ℏ.
On the other hand, the Hamiltonian describing the motion of the electron around
the proton is given by H = p2
2μ + VC(r). Therefore, the uncertainty relation leads to
approximately E ≳ℏ2
2μ( 1
r )2 −e2
r for the corresponding energy. The kinetic energy
increases when r decreases and cancels the gain of the Coulomb energy, and even
leads to a positive total energy. The radius of the Hydrogen atom, i.e., the Bohr radius
aB, is obtained as the value of r which minimizes the energy E.
Sidebar 3: Atoms should have collapsed if the uncertainty principle or the com-
mutation relation were absent Since the uncertainty principle is derived from the
commutation relation [ˆxα, ˆpβ] = iℏδαβ, where ˆO is the operator corresponding to an
observable O, atoms would become point particles if the commutation relation did
not govern the nature.
Sidebar 4: Application to Screening Effect As we learnt in Sect.1.4 concerning
the nuclear reactions in the Sun, many nuclear reactions in stars occur by quantum
tunneling through the potential barrier called the Coulomb barrier made by the long-
range Coulomb interaction. An interesting phenomenon in this connection is the
screening effect caused by the surrounding charged particles which are in the plasma
state in hot stars. It leads to an enhancement of the tunneling effect. Recently, the
screening effect is argued also in connection with laboratory experiments, where
low-energy nuclear reactions are caused in matter, e.g., in host metals [11]. It is
reported that the reaction rate is enhanced and the screening effect is considered to
be one of the origins of the enhancement. The interest is whether the enhancement
of the reaction rate by the screening effect due to the presence of the host material is
large and can explain the observed enhancement [12].
Let us denote the effective Coulomb potential, i.e., the screened Coulomb poten-
tial, around a nucleus with electric charge Ze by ϕ(r). If we represent the change of
the density of a charged particle ζ with the electric charge Zζe in the surrounding
induced by this nucleus as δρζ(r), then ϕ(r) obeys the Poisson equation

(2.42)
The nuclear reactions in matter at laboratories are performed at the room tem-
perature. Hence, we can use the Thomas–Fermi approximation for the density of
electrons of the host material, and obtain
ϕ(r) = Ze
r exp(−qTFr)
(2.43)

On the other hand, for nuclear reactions in hot stars, the densities of the charged
particles composing the plasma are well represented by the Boltzmann distribution.

Nuclear Masses
We denote the mass of the nucleus with the mass number A and the atomic number
Z by M(A, Z). The nuclear mass is one of the basic quantities of each nucleus. At
the same time, it is a fundamental quantity which governs various nuclear reactions.

the mass number A [13]
2.3.1
The Binding Energies: Experimental Data
and Characteristics
One usually uses the binding energy B(A, Z) for the mass M(A, Z) in various
discussions. The B(A, Z) is deﬁned as the energy gain obtained by forming a nucleus
instead of being completely apart as individual nucleons. It is therefore given by16,17
B(A, Z) = Z Mpc2 + (A −Z)Mnc2 −M(A, Z)c2 .
(2.48)
The ﬁlled circles in Fig.2.6 show the experimental value of the binding energy
per nucleon B/A for the most stable even–even nucleus for each mass number, and
the open circles that for the most stable nucleus in the case of odd mass number.18
The inset shows the details for nuclei with small mass number, i.e., for light nuclei.
The binding energy has the following characteristics including those shown in these
ﬁgures.
(1) The binding energy rapidly increases with the mass number in the region of
small mass number (see Table2.3).19
16The separation energy is also an important related physical quantity. It is the energy needed to
remove a particle such as a nucleon or an alpha particle from the nucleus. For example, the separation
energy of neutron is given by Sn(N, Z) ≡B(A, Z) −B(A −1, Z) in terms of the binding energies
of the relevant nuclei.
17The binding energy of a nucleus is usually calculated from the mass of the corresponding neutral
atom Matom(A, Z) as
B(A, Z) = Z MHc2 + (A −Z)Mnc2 −Matom(A, Z)c2 ,
(2.47)
where MH is the mass of the Hydrogen atom.
18Exactly speaking, they have been obtained by using Eq. (2.47).
19We name deuteron and triton and denote by d and t in the case of nuclei, while name deuterium
and tritium and denote by D and T in the case of neutral atoms.

(2) The B/A shows a sharp maximum at each light α-nucleus.20,21
(3) The binding energy per nucleon B/A is always about 8MeV except for light
nuclei (saturation property of the binding energy).
(4) Roughly speaking, the B/A steadily increases with the mass number until the
region of Fe whose atomic number is 26,22 then gradually decreases with A.
(5) The B/A shows local maxima when the number of either protons or neutrons
takes special numbers, e.g., Z = 50, in the region of large mass number.
(6) There exist systematic dependences on the even–odd property of the number of
protons and that of neutrons as shown in Table2.4.23,24
Let us introduce here a few topics associated with the characteristics of the binding
energy mentioned from (1) through (6).
Topic 1: The Energy Generation in the Main Sequence Stars The characteristic
(1) mentioned above is the reason why the energy is generated by nuclear fusion in
stars in the main sequence. The binding energies of light nuclei including the values

multiples of those of α particle are called α-nuclei.
21The binding energy of 8
4Be is less than twice that of α by 0.1MeV, so that 8
4Be is unstable and
exists only transiently.
22The nucleus which has the largest value of B/A is 62
28Ni (see [14]).
23Only 5 nuclei, i.e., d, 6
3Li, 10
5 B, 14
7 N, 180
73 Ta (isomer), are stable among the so-called odd–odd
nuclei, which have odd numbers for both the proton and the neutron numbers. Incidentally, it is
209
83 Bi which has the largest atomic number among stable nuclei, although exactly speaking it decays
with the half-life of 1.9 × 1019 years. There exist no stable isotopes for Tc and Pm, whose atomic
numbers are 43 and 61, respectively.
24It is related to the pairing correlation between nucleons, which will be discussed later in detail.

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
listed in Table2.3 are the important quantities to determine the energies released
by those nuclear reactions and also the energies of the emitted particles such as
neutrinos.
The nuclear reactions which power the main sequence stars can be classiﬁed into
(a) pp-chain (proton–proton chain) reactions, which consist of ppI-chain, ppII-chain
and ppIII-chain reactions, and (b) CNO cycle. Their reactions and the associated
energy releases are as follows:
• ppI chain
1 p+p →2H+e+ +νe +0.42MeV
(νpp)
2 e+ +e−→2γ +1.02MeV
3
2H+p →3He+γ +5.49MeV
4
3He+ 3He →4He+2p+12.86MeV
• ppII chain
5
3He+ 4He →7Be+γ
6
7Be+e−→7Li+νe
(νBe)
7
7Li+p →2 4He
• ppIII chain
8
7Be+p →8B+γ
9
8B →8Be+e+ +νe
(νB)
10
8Be →2 4He
• CNO cycle
11
12C+p →13N+γ +1.94MeV
12
13N →13C+e+ +νe +1.20MeV
13
13C+p →14N+γ +7.55MeV
14
14N+p→15O+γ +7.29MeV
15
15O →15N+e+ +νe +1.74MeV
16
15N+p →12C+ 4He+4.97MeV
17 e+ +e−→2γ +1.02MeV
We introduced the notations νpp, νBe, νB to distinguish neutrinos of different origins.
By adding the nuclear reactions in 1 – 4 with appropriate weights, one can see
that the energy of 26.72MeV in total is released by converting four protons into one
4He nucleus in the ppI chain,
4p + 2e−→4He + 2νe + 26.72 MeV.
(2.49)
Also for the CNO cycle, we obtain the same net reaction formula as Eq. (2.49) by
adding 11– 16 and subtracting twice of 17 on each side. The central temperature
of the Sun is about 16millionK, and the standard solar model predicts that about
98.5% of the solar energy is produced by nuclear reactions in the pp chain, while the
remaining about 1.5% by the CNO cycle.

The solar neutrino problem25 was a serious problem, which lasted from mid-
1960s to the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. It is now attributed to the neutrino
oscillation.
Topic 2: The Energy Problem: Muon-Catalysed Fusion (μCF) The binding ener-
gies of light nuclei listed in Table2.3 are important quantities in connection with the
so-called energy problem as well. For example, if the nuclear reactions p+d →3He,
d+t →4He+n take place, the energy of 5.4 and 17.5MeV is released per reaction for
the two cases, respectively. However, like the p+p→d+e+ +νe reaction in the Sun
mentioned in Sect.1.4, the high Coulomb barrier between the projectile and target
nuclei has to be overcome in order for these reactions to occur. The so-called high-
temperature fusion reactions attempt to overcome the Coulomb barrier by heating
the nuclei to high temperature. In this case, the nuclei of high temperature need to be
conﬁned in a small space. To that end, various methods such as the magnetic conﬁne-
ment, where the hot fusion fuel is conﬁned by magnetic ﬁelds in a small space in the
form of plasma, and the inertial conﬁnement have been developed. However, none
of the methods have yet reached the practical usage for the power production. The
muon-catalysed fusion is an alternative method, where one tries to induce fusion
reactions at low temperature by lowering the Coulomb barrier with the screening
effect by μ−particle.
Figure2.9 shows the muon-catalysed pd fusion which has been conﬁrmed exper-
imentally for the ﬁrst time as the evidence of the μCF.26 Figure2.10 conceptually
shows the muon-catalysed dt fusion which is currently thought to be most promis-
25It is the problem that the observed number of solar neutrinos is only about 1/2–1/3 of the
theoretical prediction.
26In 1956, Alvarez et al. discovered a trajectory of muon which stops in the liquid hydrogen
contaminated with deuterium. The ﬂight length in matter is determined by the stopping power. The
length 1.7cm of the trajectory observed by Alvarez et al. exactly matched the ﬂight length of muon
with energy of 5.4MeV which is released in the p+d→3He reaction.

ing from the point of view of the practical usage for the power production. In the
latter, the liquid target of the mixture of about 50% each of deuterium and tritium
is injected by μ−particle produced by nuclear reactions. Thus produced dμ and tμ
atoms collide to form a dtμ molecule. Eventually the nuclear reaction
d + t →α + n
(2.51)
takes place. The μ−particle which stimulated tunneling effect through screening
the Coulomb barrier ﬁnishes the role of a catalyst by forming a muonic atom by
sticking to the α particle produced in the nuclear reaction with a certain probability.
However, with a much higher probability it leaves the nucleus by using a part of
the energy released in the reaction, and repeats the cycle as a catalyst. Whether the
muon-catalysed fusion is useful for the practical usage for the energy generation or
not depends on the number of cycle per muon, whose mean life is 2.2µs, and the
reactivation probability by collision of the muon lost by forming a muonic atom
such as αμ. The dtμ reaction is more promising than the pdμ reaction, because the
dtμ molecule is produced resonantly by the so-called Vesman mechanism, and also
because the sticking probability is smaller (see [18] for details).

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
Finally, we wish to refer to the nuclear reaction in matter [11] as a closely related
research. It is the study, for example, to see whether the rates of the d+d→t+p,
3He+n reactions are signiﬁcantly enhanced over those in the free space if a metal
target such as Pd and PdO is continuously bombarded with deuterons.
Topic 3: The Alpha Particle Model and Cluster Structures Symmetry plays impor-
tant roles in physics. The characteristic (2) of the binding energy mentioned in
Sect.2.3.1 originates from the property of nuclear force that favours states with good
spatial symmetry. Historically, based on this property, the model called the α-particle
model has been proposed which views the light α-nuclei as aggregates of α parti-
cles and describes their ground states and low-lying excited states by special spatial
conﬁgurations or relative motions of the constituent α particles or by the rotations
of the whole nucleus. In this model, for example, the ground state of 12C is thought
to be an equilateral triangle conﬁguration of three α particles, while the ground state
of 16O a regular tetrahedron of four α particles. In these days, the standard model
for nuclear structure is the shell model which views the nucleus as an ensemble of
nucleons which are moving independently from each other in a common mean ﬁeld
of a single center in the zeroth order approximation (see Chap.5). On the contrary,
the α-particle model is a molecular point of view or a molecular structure model
which assumes the existence of multi-centers or of density localization. This idea
has been extended to variational calculations and currently to the cluster model (the
study of cluster structure) by using the mean-ﬁeld theory or the molecular dynam-
ics calculations, and intensive studies are going on from that points of view. The
molecular structures are expected to appear at the energies near the threshold energy
for each molecular structure, and are characterized by having a large decay width to
each corresponding decay channel as an indicator. Figure2.11 shows27 the excitation
energy of various molecular structures in light nuclei expected from this idea. It is
called the Ikeda diagram (see [20, 21] for details of the study of cluster structure).
Figure2.12 shows the energy-level diagram of 12C in the region of low excitation
energies [22] in order to help a deeper understanding. The second 0+ state denoted
by 0+
2 at the excitation energy 7.65MeV, which is close to the threshold energy for
the α-decay 7.37MeV, is a state for which the 3α-particle model works well.28 The
ground state locates somewhat far from the threshold energy for the α-decay. Conse-
quently, the density localization becomes less signiﬁcant. Nevertheless, the picture
that the state consists of 3α-clusters which form an equilateral triangle conﬁgura-
tion is still valid to some extent. One can think that it is an experimental evidence
that there appears a 3−state at a low excitation energy, i.e., at 9.64MeV, which is
expected from the D3h symmetry of the point group associated with the equilateral
triangle conﬁguration. The existence of a rotational band, 0g.s., 2+
1 (4.44MeV), 4+
1
(14.08 MeV ≈4.44 MeV × 3.33) also supports this point of view. However, if there

28The synthesis of 12C in stars proceeds as 8Be+α →12C(0+
2 ), 12C(0+
2 ) →12C(0+
g.s.) In that sense,
the 0+
2 state of 12C plays a crucial role in the synthesis of heavy elements, and is named Hoyle-state
after F. Hoyle who predicted the existence of this state.

appear states only up to 4+ member, the rotational property of the spectrum can
be explained also by a usual shell model without assuming the density localization
(Elliott’s SU(3) model). A more accurate description of the ground state and the
ground-state rotational band is provided by a hybrid model, which hybridizes the
α-cluster model and the shell model in order to take into account the broken spatial
symmetry due to the spin–orbit interaction [23].29 Incidentally, the cluster structure
29In the case of 12C, the spin–orbit interaction reduces the extent of deformation and increases
the excitation energy of the 2+
1 state. From the point of view of shell model, a force with smaller
spin–orbit splitting leads to a high degeneracy and to a larger deformation due to the Jahn–Teller
effect, while a force with a strong spin–orbit force leads to a large splitting between the p3/2 and

and the deformation of nuclei, which is described in detail in Chap.7 can be thought
to be a kind of Jahn–Teller effect.30
Exercise 2.10 Let us assume that three α particles form an equilateral triangle, i.e.,
the D3h state of the point group. Show that in this case the component of the angular
momentum along the axis perpendicular to the plane made by the three α particles,
which is called the K quantum number, takes only multiples of 3.
Topic 4: The Onion Layer Structure of a Massive Star and the Iron Core In
massive stars whose mass M exceeds 12 times the solar mass, i.e., M > 12M⊙,
there exists a core consisting of Fe and Ni at the center and successive layers of grad-
ually smaller atomic number distribute towards the surface (onion layer structure).
Figure2.13 shows the inner structure of a presupernova star. The core part consists
of Fe and Ni, because the binding energy per particle becomes the largest in the Fe
region as remarked in Sect.2.3.1 as the characteristic (4) of the binding energy per
nucleon B/A.31,32 For the same reason, nuclei with small atomic number and mass
(Footnote 29 continued)
p1/2 states. Consequently, the degeneracy disappears and the spherical shape is predicted to appear.
Inversely, if one considers from the point of view of the cluster model, too large deformation or
clusterization is predicted and consequently the excitation energy of the 2+
1 state becomes too low
compared with the experimental data if one assumes the cluster state which extends the pure state
of the maximum spatial symmetry of the shell model denoted by (0s)4(0p)8[444]11L conﬁguration
by introducing a ﬁnite distance between three alpha clusters, but ignores the spin–orbit interaction,
and the experimental data can be well reproduced by admixing states with lower spatial symmetry
by the spin–orbit interaction.
30In the case when the electronic states degenerate in energy in a polyatomic molecule where the
atoms have a highly symmetric geometrical conﬁguration such as a regular polyhedron, it becomes
energetically more stable if the degeneracy is removed by assuming a conﬁguration of atoms with
lower symmetry. This is known as the Jahn–Teller effect. Similar situations occur in many physical
systems including metal microclusters.
31A statement often appears in the literature that the central part of massive stars consists of 56
26Fe
due to the fact that the nucleus which has the largest binding energy per nucleon is 56
26Fe. However,
in reality, the nucleus which has the maximum binding energy per nucleon is 62
28Ni. It is understood
that the reason why the major component of the core is 56
26Fe despite this fact is because 62
28Ni is
hard to be synthesized by nuclear reactions in stars, while 56
26Fe can be easily synthesized as the last
nucleus in the Si-burning reaction.
32The temperature of the central part has to be sufﬁciently high in order for the core of Fe and Ni
to be formed in the central part of stars. In the stars whose mass is not so large, the central part

number proceed towards Fe and Ni by fusion reactions. On the contrary, nuclei with
large atomic number and mass number proceed to Fe and Ni by ﬁssion.
Topic 5: The Supernova Explosion It is known that there exist two types of super-
nova explosion, i.e., that initiated by carbon detonation and by gravitational col-
lapse.33 In the latter case, and in massive stars whose core part is made of Fe and
Ni, the gravitational collapse is triggered when Fe in the core captures surrounding
electrons by electron capture reaction,
56
26Fe + e−→56
25Mn + νe ,
(2.52)
and consequently when the degeneracy pressure of electrons decreases. Also, if the
central temperature exceeds 5 × 109 K, an endothermic photo-disintegration reaction
of Fe,
56
26Fe + γ →134He + 4n −125 MeV,
(2.53)
takes place in addition, and at higher temperatures, the photo-disintegration reaction
of 4He,
4He + γ →2n + 2p −28.3 MeV,
(2.54)
occurs as well. The internal energy which should have increased by contraction does
not lead to the increase of the pressure by being used in these endothermic reactions.
Thus, the contraction of the star cannot be prevented. Consequently, the gravitational
collapse of the star proceeds and eventually is bounced back by the hard core in the
nuclear force (see Sect.3.7) when the density increases so high as nucleons start
to overlap. The collapse thus changes into explosion and neutrinos and many other
particles are emitted into space. This is a scenario of the supernova explosion. The
supernova explosion is an interesting subject to be studied also in connection with
the synthesis of elements, e.g., as a site to synthesize heavy elements such as U by
rapid neutron capture reactions called r-process.
Exercise 2.11 Show that the thermal pressure in high temperature ideal gas is given
by
PT = ρT

in terms of the temperature T and the density ρ. (Hint: Assume that the momentum
distribution of the gas is given by the Boltzmann distribution. See Sect.6.2.5.)
(Footnote 32 continued)
therefore consists of nuclei with smaller mass number than that of Fe, though they have an onion
layer structure. For example, the central part of stars whose mass lies between 8M⊙< M < 12M⊙
consists of O, Ne and Mg.
33There is an alternative way to classify the supernova explosion into the type II and I, respectively,
depending on whether the spectrum contains the hydrogen line or not.

(2.56)
which takes into account major physical effects. Equation (2.56) is called the
Weizsäcker–Bethe mass formula.34 The ﬁrst and the second terms on the right-hand
side are called the volume and the surface35 terms, respectively, because the nuclear
radius is proportional to A1/3. The property that the bulk binding energy is the vol-
ume term which is proportional to the number of constituent particles comes from
the fact that the nuclear force which stabilizes a nucleus as an isolated bound sys-
tem is of short range as we learn in the next chapter. The existence of the surface
term will be easily understood from the point of view of the liquid-drop model for
nuclei. The third term is called the symmetry energy term and tends to locate sta-
ble nuclei along the diagonal line in the nuclear chart. We will learn its origin later
somewhat in detail. The fourth term represents the effect of Coulomb energy. As we
have already remarked in Sect.2.3.1 the last term originates from the pairing correla-
tion between nucleons and represents the fact that the binding energy systematically
changes according to the even–odd property of the atomic number and of the neutron
number. It will be described in detail in Sect.5.8.
The values of the parameters in the mass formula somewhat vary depending
on the experimental data to be reproduced. The solid line in Fig.2.6 represents the
theoretical values given by the mass formula when the parameters bvol, bsurf, bsym, bC
are determined by the least-square ﬁt to the binding energies of even–even nuclei
for which N, Z > 7 and the experimental error of the binding energy B is smaller
than 200keV [25]. We ﬁxed the δ for the pairing correlation to be δ = 12/
√
AMeV.
The dotted line represents the similar ﬁt to odd nuclei. In both cases, the ﬁtting was
performed to the most stable isobar for each mass number A, i.e., the experimental
data shown in the ﬁgure. We observe that the mass formula well reproduces the bulk
behaviour of the binding energy. Thus obtained values of the parameters are listed
in Table2.5.
Comment: The Reason Why Stable Nuclei Locate along the Diagonal Line of
the Nuclear Chart: The Symmetry Energy and Its Origin As stated above, the
symmetry energy locates stable nuclei nearly along the diagonal line in the nuclear
chart. Let us consider the contribution of the kinetic energy to the binding energy in
34At present, there exist several reﬁned mass formulae [24] reﬂecting various studies such as those
of unstable nuclei, superheavy elements and nucleosynthesis of elements through r-process. In those
reﬁned mass formulae, for example, the effects of surface diffuseness and of the symmetry energy
correction to the volume as well as the surface terms are considered.
35If we deﬁne the nuclear surface tension σ by σ ≡bsurf A2/3/4π(r0 A1/3)2, then σ ∼1 MeV/fm2.

(2.58)
The comparison of this value with the value of the parameter of the symmetry energy
bsym given in Table2.5 shows that about half of the symmetry energy arises from
the kinetic energy due to the Pauli exclusion principle (Pauli effect). The other half
originates from the fact that the nuclear force in the isospin singlet term, i.e., that
between n and p in the isospin singlet conﬁguration, is stronger than that in the
isospin triplet terms, i.e., that in the isospin triplet conﬁgurations of the pp, np and
nn systems as we learn in the next chapter.
2.3.3
Applications of the Mass Formula (1): The Stability
Line, the Heisenberg Valley
The mass formula is useful, for example, to predict the masses of unknown nuclei
and also to discuss the bulk aspects concerning the stability of nuclei such as the
stability with respect to ﬁssion. Here and in the next subsection, let us study some
of the applications of the mass formula.
2.3.3.1
The Formula for the Stability Line
In the region of small atomic number, the stable nuclei locate along the diagonal
line or in the vicinity in the nuclear chart. This is due to the symmetry energy term

44
2
Bulk Properties of Nuclei
in the mass formula. However, the contribution of the Coulomb energy becomes
non-negligible as the atomic number gets large. Consequently, the location of stable
nuclei gradually deviates from the diagonal line and the neutron number of stable
nuclei becomes about 1.6 times the proton number (N ∼1.6Z) in the region of large
atomic number such as U. This trend can be derived from the mass formula. If we
denote the atomic number of the most stable nucleus for a given mass number A0 by
Zβs(A0), then
∂
∂Z B(A, Z)|A=A0 = 0 at Z = Zβs(A0). Hence we obtain
Zβs(A) =
A/2
1 +
bC
2bsym A2/3 ≈

1 + 0.00803A2/3
(2.59)
from the mass formula. We used the values listed in Table2.5 in obtaining the third
term. If we denote the value of Z in the case when we let N = 1.6Z by ˜Z, for example,
Zβs = 61, ˜Z = 58 for A = 150, and Zβs = 81, ˜Z = 80 for A = 208, indicating that
the values of Zβs and ˜Z are very close to each other. In fact, 150
62 Sm and 208
82 Pb are
stable nuclei.36 In this way, the ratio between the proton number and the neutron
number for heavy nuclei is determined by the balance between the Coulomb energy
and the symmetry energy.
2.3.3.2
The Heisenberg Valley
Figure2.14 is a schematic three-dimensional representation of the nuclear mass
M as a function of the neutron number N and the proton number Z. There exist
three planes corresponding to the even–even, even–odd or odd–even, and odd–odd
nuclei due to the pairing term δ in the mass formula. The line along a cross section
represents the variation of the masses for a given isobars. It behaves like a quadratic
function because of the symmetry energy. This property is shown in Fig.2.15 for the
nuclei with odd-mass number, and in Fig.2.16 for even-A nuclei. As these ﬁgures

58 Ce and 208
80 Hg are unstable nuclei. The relationship N ∼1.6Z should be taken only as a rough
relationship that holds in the region of large mass number. To be accurate, it is safer to use Eq. (2.59).

show, there exist one stable nucleus in the case of odd A and 1–3 stable nuclei in the
case of even A which are stable with respect to β-decay or electron capture.
These stable nuclei form a kind of valley in Fig.2.14 as the mass number is varied.
This valley is called the Heisenberg valley. Its projection on the N Z-plane follows
almost along Eq. (2.59). The synthesis of light elements up to Fe by nuclear fusion
and the synthesis of heavy elements up to Bi by the slow neutron capture reaction,
called s-process, proceed along the Heisenberg valley.
Incidentally, the conditions for the β−-decay, β+-decay and electron capture to
occur are given by the following equations using the mass M(A, Z) of the neutral
atom of atomic number Z and mass number A, the mass of electron me and the
binding energy Δe of the electron to be captured in the electron capture in the atom
before it is captured,
M(A, Z) > M(A, Z + 1)
for β−decay,
(2.60)
M(A, Z) > M(A, Z −1) + 2me
for β+decay,
(2.61)
M(A, Z) > M(A, Z −1) + Δe/c2
for electron capture.
(2.62)
Here, we ignored the change of the binding energy of electron associated with the
change of atom.

Applications of the Mass Formula (2): Stability
with Respect to Fission
Fission or nuclear ﬁssion is a process where a nucleus with a large atomic number
such as U, Th and Pu disintegrates into two fragments, called ﬁssion fragments, with
nearly equal mass numbers. As an example, Fig.2.17 shows the mass distribution
of the ﬁssion fragments in the thermal-neutron-induced ﬁssion of 235U.37 The ﬁs-
sion was discovered by Hahn and Strassmann in 1938 [28].38 Bohr and Wheeler
gave a theoretical interpretation soon after the discovery of ﬁssion. The following
discussions follow their paper [29].39
Figure2.18schematicallyrepresentsaprocess,whereanucleusviewedasaliquid-
drop disintegrates into two ﬁssion fragments of equal mass, i.e., of a symmetric
ﬁssion.40 The conﬁguration d in the ﬁgure is called scission point.
37In the spontaneous ﬁssion or in the induced ﬁssion by a small energy, hence with low excita-
tion energy, ﬁssion with a striking mass-asymmetry occurs as shown in Fig.2.17 because of the
shell effect which we study in Chap.5. Also, a few neutrons are emitted simultaneously in each
spontaneous ﬁssion and in each thermal neutron-induced ﬁssion. For example, the average num-
bers of neutrons emitted in thermal neutron-induced ﬁssion of 235U and 239
94 Pu are 2.4 and 2.9,
respectively [27].
38Hahn and Strassmann, who were studying the decay of U by irradiation with neutrons, discovered
ﬁssion by identifying the ﬁssion fragments, which had been believed to be 88Ra, 89Ac, 90Th, as
56Ba, 57La, 58Ce. Lise Meitner made also a signiﬁcant contribution to the series of studies as a
collaborator of Hahn.
39The basic data and theoretical descriptions of ﬁssion are given in detail in [27].
40As we learn in Chap.7 many nuclei which undergo spontaneous ﬁssion such as actinides to which
U belongs are deformed even in their ground states due to the shell effect, i.e., a quantum effect,
and the long axis is about 30% longer than the short axis. Also, as shown in Fig.2.17, most of the
ﬁssion is an asymmetric ﬁssion, where the masses of the two ﬁssion fragments are signiﬁcantly
different. Following the original picture of Bohr–Wheeler which is based on the liquid-drop model,

2.3.4.1
The Q-Value of a Spontaneous Fission
Let us ﬁrst evaluate the Q-value of a spontaneous ﬁssion by assuming that a nucleus
with a large mass number disintegrates into two ﬁssion fragments with equal mass.41
We have

(2.65)
from the mass formula. Hence, if Z2/A > 17.7, i.e., if Z > 35 when we assume A ∼
2Z, the nucleus eventually undergoes ﬁssion even if we leave it alone. This is called
spontaneous ﬁssion.42 For example, if one assumes the ﬁssion 236
92 U→2 × 118
46Pd,
then the Q-value is about 182MeV.43
Fig. 2.19 An illustration of
the ﬁssion barrier by the
liquid-drop model
(Footnote 40 continued)
we develop in this book our discussions by assuming that the ground state of nuclei prior to ﬁssion,
which is a metastable state, is spherical. Incidentally, the shell effect was discovered and the shell
model has been established much later.
41The heat associated with a nuclear reaction or with an atomic or a molecular reaction is called the
Q-value of the reaction. It becomes positive or negative for exothermic or endothermic reactions,
respectively. It corresponds to the energy released by ﬁssion in the case of a nuclear ﬁssion.
42Fission is stimulated if the nucleus is irradiated by a photon, or neutron or by other particles. Such
reaction is called induced ﬁssion and is distinguished from the spontaneous ﬁssion. It is represented
as, for example, (γ ,f) and (n,f) for photoﬁssion and neutron-induced ﬁssion, respectively.
43About 200MeV is a measure of the Q-value for the ﬁssion of actinides such as U.

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
Fig. 2.20 Illustration of the
ﬁssion barrier by the
liquid-drop model with shell
effect [27]
The fact that the Q-value is positive does not necessarily mean that ﬁssion takes
place instantaneously. Figure2.19 schematically shows the potential barrier govern-
ing ﬁssion. How to take ﬁssion coordinates is itself an important question. Here, we
take the nuclear deformation as the ﬁssion coordinate corresponding to the concep-
tual picture for ﬁssion shown in Fig.2.18. This potential barrier has to be overcome
by a quantum tunneling in order for ﬁssion to occur.44 Consequently, the lifetime
for ﬁssion is extremely long. For example, the half-life is T sf
1/2 ∼1017 years in the
case of 238U. On the other hand, heavy nuclei decay also by emitting α particle. As
we learn in Sect.8.1, the α-decay also occurs by a quantum tunneling. In that case,
the abscissa of the potential barrier which corresponds to Fig.2.19 is the relative
coordinate between the α particle and the remaining nucleus in the α-decay, called
the daughter nucleus.45 In the case of 238U, the half-life of α-decay is T α
1/2 ∼109
years. As is clear in the WKB formula for a quantum tunneling Eqs. (8.6), (8.7) or a
revised formula in the uniform approximation Eq. (2.77), the tunneling probability
dramatically decreases following the exponential law as the mass parameter μ of the
decaying particle or of the decaying degree of freedom gets large. The μ is nearly
equal to the mass of the α particle in the case of α-decay, while the reduced mass of
the ﬁssion fragments gives a rough measure of μ in the case of ﬁssion if the relative
coordinate between ﬁssion fragments is used as the ﬁssion coordinate. Obviously, the
44In reality, ﬁssion is a quantum tunneling in a multidimensional space with many degrees of
freedom.
45In the case of α-decay, the potential barrier to be transmitted by a quantum tunneling is located
outside the sum of the radii of the α particle and the daughter nucleus. In other words, if we consider
the α-decay as a kind of ﬁssion process, then the potential barrier appears outside the scission point.
That is the reason why the coordinate for the α-decay can be taken to be the coordinate of the
relative motion.

2.3 Nuclear Masses
49
latter is much larger. In addition, roughly speaking, the barrier height is proportional
to the product of the charges of the ﬁssion fragments. One can therefore expect that
the barrier height to be transmitted is much higher for ﬁssion. It is why the half-life
for ﬁssion is much longer than that for α-decay. Consequently, the decay of heavy
elements occurs mainly by α-decay.
Figure2.20 shows schematic potential surfaces for ﬁssion by Nix. The solid and
the dotted lines are the potential surfaces with and without shell correction, which
will be discussed later, respectively. It should be remarked that the shell correction
introduces a dip in the potential surface at the barrier region.
2.3.4.2
Potential Barrier with Respect to Symmetric Spontaneous
Fission and the Fissility Parameter
(1) Fission Coordinate: Deformation Parameter Let us next study how the poten-
tial surface with respect to ﬁssion shown conceptually in Fig.2.19 depends on the
atomic number and the mass number. Since the isotopes of 235,238U exist in nature
with ﬁnite but long lifetimes, one can expect that the potential surface for ﬁssion
has a potential barrier as depicted in Fig.2.19 up to at least Z = 92. On the other
hand, there exist no stable nuclei with an extremely large atomic number. One can
therefore also expect that the potential barrier ultimately disappears for large enough
atomic number. How large is the atomic number at the border?
As stated before, it is not clear at all how to choose the coordinates or parameters
for ﬁssion. It will be natural to use the distance between two ﬁssion fragments as the
ﬁssion coordinate once they are more apart than the scission point in the late stage
of ﬁssion. However, the deformation parameters introduced in the following will be
more natural to describe the initial stage of ﬁssion.
Let us consider ﬁssion as a process, where the deformation of a nucleus grows
with axial symmetry. The radius R(θ) of an axial-symmetrically deformed nucleus
can be expanded as
R(θ) = R0


λ=2,4,...

(2.66)
by using the Legendre functions Pλ(cos θ), which form a complete set. Here, αλ
are called the deformation parameters. Among them, α2, α4 are named quadrupole
and hexadecapole deformation parameters, respectively.46 α0 is given as a func-
tion of αλ̸=0 from the condition of volume conservation by considering nucleus
as an incompressible liquid. Let us truncate the expansion in Eq. (2.66) by the
λ = 2 term in order to understand the physical meaning of the deformation para-
meter. If we let the radius for θ = 0 and θ = π/2 to be a and b, respectively,
46We do not consider λ = 1, because it describes the translational motion of the nucleus as a
whole. There holds the relationship αλ = √(2λ + 1)/4πα20 between the αλ in this section and the
deformation parameters αλμ, which will be introduced in Chap.7.

we obtain a ≡R(0) = R0(1 + α2), b ≡R(π/2) = R0(1 −α2/2) ∼R0/√1 + α2
by using P2(cos θ) = (3 cos2 θ −1)/2. One can see that one obtains a nuclear shape
which is elongated (shrunk) along the symmetry axis for positive (negative) α2. Also,
as the expressions for a and b show, the volume is conserved for small deformation
in accord with the property of a nucleus as an incompressible liquid. In Eq. (2.66),
we assumed the symmetric ﬁssion, i.e., the reﬂection symmetry with respect to the
plane which equally divides the symmetry axis. Correspondingly, the deformation
parameters of odd order such as the octupole deformation λ = 3 have been omitted.
In Fig.2.21, we show the nuclear shape corresponding to λ = 2, 3 and 4.
Exercise 2.13 Conﬁrm that the relation shown in Fig.2.21 between the nuclear
shape and the sign of α4 = √9/4πα40 in the presence of hexadecapole deforma-
tion holds by using the explicit functional form of the Legendre polynomial P4(z),
P4(z) = (35z4 −30z2 + 3)/8.
(2) Stability with Respect to Fission: Fissility Parameter Both the surface energy
Esurf and the Coulomb energy EC change when a nucleus changes its shape. Hence
it is necessary to study how they depend on the deformation parameters in order to
evaluate the potential barrier with respect to ﬁssion. The following formulae can be
obtained from the mass formula:

We see that there appears a potential barrier for the nuclei with χ < 1 and they
become metastable with respect to ﬁssion. On the contrary, nuclei with a large atomic
number for which χ > 1 have no potential barrier and immediately disintegrate by
ﬁssion.47 The χ is called the ﬁssility parameter.
(3) The Height of the Fission Barrier In reality, the spontaneous ﬁssion is a quantum
tunneling in a multidimensional space speciﬁed either by various deformation para-
meters or by appropriately chosen coordinates. Figure2.22, which has been quoted
from a paper by Bohr and Wheeler, schematically illustrates ﬁssion. The lines in the
ﬁgure on the left side represent equipotential surfaces. In a simpliﬁed picture, one
considers that a spherical metastable state decays along a path going through the
saddle point. Let us deﬁne the height of the ﬁssion barrier as the height of the saddle
point measured from the potential minimum corresponding to the metastable state
for ﬁssion, and denote it by E f . The value of E f can be approximately written down
as a function of χ if the ﬁssility parameter χ is small or close to 1. An important
point in doing so is that the position of the saddle point moves from a conﬁguration
47The critical nucleus is (Acr, Zcr) ∼(340, 131) if we use N ∼1.6Z. However, in more reﬁned
estimates which go beyond the quadrupole deformation we used here the potential barrier by the
liquid-drop model almost disappears when the atomic number exceeds the critical value Zcr ∼100
[30].

with small deformation near a in Fig.2.18 to a conﬁguration near the scission point d
as the ﬁssility parameter gets smaller starting from 1. If we take a simpliﬁcation that
the scission point coincides with the saddle point when χ = 0, E f can be estimated

On the contrary, the saddle point appears in the region of small deformation when χ
is close to 1. Hence it makes sense to express the energy surface in the expansion with
respect to deformation parameters. It is, of course, needed to include terms beyond
the second order in order to determine the position and the height of the saddle point.

to the surface energy. After [29]
Figure2.23 shows the behaviour of f (χ) after the paper by Bohr and Wheeler
[29]. A line which interpolates Eqs. (2.73) and (2.76) is shown as f (χ). The f ∗(χ)
represents f (χ) given by Eq. (2.73). The value of E f which is expected when the
surface energy for the shaded region around χ ∼0.75 is set to 530MeV is shown
in the inset on the right corner, since the surface energy does not so change in that
region.48
The experimental value of E f can be deduced, for example, from the excitation
function of (n,f), (t,pf), (t,df), (d,pf), (γ ,f) reactions which are induced by bombard-
ing a target nucleus with either light nuclei or photons.49 As an example, Fig.2.24
shows the excitation functions of the ﬁssion probabilities for the 239U(n,f) and for
the 239U(d,pf) reactions. They are denoted by the solid line and the dots, respectively.
Both ﬁssion excitation functions exhibit a characteristic threshold rise followed by a
ﬂat plateau. A reasonable estimate of the barrier height can be obtained by identifying
it to the energy at which the ﬁssion probability becomes 1/2 of its plateau value. It
is because the tunneling probability or the barrier transmission probability becomes
1/2 when the decay energy E coincides with the height of the ﬁssion barrier, as can
be seen from the following formula for the barrier transmission probability in the
uniform approximation:
PUA =
1
1 + exp(2
 r>
r< dr√2μ(V (r) −E)/ℏ) ,
(2.77)
which is valid from below to above the barrier as long as the ﬁssion barrier is a
quadratic function or can be well approximated by a quadratic function. In Eq. (2.77),
48Bohr and Wheeler estimated the value of E f for the other nuclei by assuming (Z2/A)cr to be
47.8 from the experimental data that E f is about 6MeV for 239U.
49The scattering cross section plotted as a function of the collision energy is called the excitation
function.

r< and r> are the classical turning points on both sides of the potential barrier:
V (r<) = V (r>) = E, and μ is the reduced mass.50 The two turning points coincide
when the decay energy E matches the height of the ﬁssion barrier, so that the resulting
barrier transmission probability becomes 1/2.

energy, which has been assumed to be given by Esurf = 17A2/3 MeV. The solid line

What is important in connection with the reactor, which we learn in Sect.2.3.5, is

amount of energy has to be supplied in order to induce ﬁssion with a large probability.
As we learn later, it is the reason why ﬁssion can be induced for 235U by a thermal
neutron with an extremely small energy, while it is necessary to inject a neutron with
the energy of the order of MeV in order to induce ﬁssion of 238U. The difference
between the two arises from the difference between neutron binding energies in the
corresponding compound nuclei, 236U and 239U. Because of the pairing correlation
appearing in the mass formula, the Bn for the former is larger by Δ than the value
estimated in the simple liquid-drop model without the correction term δ. On the
other hand, it gets smaller by Δ in the latter. In fact, the difference between the two

(4) Spontaneous Fission Half-Lives Figure2.26 shows the spontaneous ﬁssion half-
lives t1/2 for several actinides (U, Pu, Cm, Cf, Fm) as a function of the ﬁssility
parameter χ (ﬁlled circles are for even–even nuclei, open circles are for even–odd
nuclei. Exactly speaking, the abscissa is slightly different from the χ deﬁned in this
book, because a symmetry energy correction is added to the surface energy term in
the mass formula). Note that the experimental data lie by and large along a straight
line in the semi-logarithmic graph. The detailed structures come from the deviation of
the ground state masses from the prediction of the liquid-drop model because of the
shell effect. Indeed, if we denote the deviation of the ground state mass from that of
the smooth liquid-drop model by δm (MeV), then the values of log10 t1/2 (yr) + 5δm
beautifully align as a function of χ [32] as shown in Fig.2.27.
The feature shown in Figs.2.26 and 2.27 can be understood as follows from the
point of view of quantum tunneling. Let us denote the curvature of the potential
surface for ﬁssion in the vicinity of the potential pocket which yields the metastable
state by ω0 ≡( ∂2V
∂r2 /μ f )1/2, where r is an appropriately chosen ﬁssion coordinate
and μ f is the corresponding mass parameter. Let us then approximate the potential
surface in the vicinity of the potential barrier by a quadratic function with curvature
Ωfb. Furthermore, assuming that ﬁssion occurs with energy much lower than the

correlation between nucleons.

Application to Nuclear Power Generation
The nuclear power generation in operation today exploits the energy release, called
nuclear energy, due to ﬁssion. In this subsection, we learn the principles of reactor
and several key words.
2.3.5.1
Nuclear Reactions in Reactor, Principles of Reactor, Chain
Reaction, Neutron Moderator, Neutron Absorber
Figure2.28 illustrates the nuclear reactions induced by injecting a neutron into a
mass of uranium which is a mixture of 235U and 238U. 235U disintegrates into two
large nuclei with about half the atomic and mass numbers of 235U (see Fig.2.17),
and two to three neutrons on average.
The phenomenon shown in Fig.2.28 can be understood as follows. As already
stated concerning the Q-value for ﬁssion, the nuclear energy of around 200MeV is
Fig. 2.28 Illustration of
nuclear reactions in reactor
(chain reaction)
52The information on both the potential surface and the effective mass is needed in order to theo-
retically evaluate the ﬁssion width. Nowadays, the potential surface can be obtained with relatively
high accuracy using, for example, the macroscopic–microscopic method, which reﬁnes the liquid-
drop model by adding the shell correction and will be described in Sect.7.6.1. On the contrary, it
is difﬁcult to estimate the mass parameter with high reliability. One can hope to obtain important
phenomenological information on the effective mass for ﬁssion by using the results of this exercise.

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
released per ﬁssion. Though most of the released energy is used as the kinetic energy
of the ﬁssion fragments, a part of it becomes their excitation energies. Roughly
speaking, the ﬁssion fragment loses its excitation energy by emitting one neutron
if the excitation energy amounts to 8MeV, which is an average binding energy of
nucleon. The resulting nucleus is usually a neutron-rich unstable nucleus, so that it
continues to lose its energy by repeating β-decay. Since the β-decay proceeds in
obedience to selection rules [33], the resulting daughter nucleus is not necessarily in
the ground state, but sometimes is above the threshold energy for neutron emission.
In that case, the state decays by emitting a neutron. Since the β-decay usually takes
place in the time scale of the order of seconds to minutes, those neutrons emitted
after the β-decay are emitted with a time delay compared with the neutrons emitted
immediately after ﬁssion. Those neutrons are therefore called delayed neutrons.
In comparison, the neutrons emitted immediately after ﬁssion are called prompt
neutrons. In consequence, two large fragments and two to three neutrons are emitted
by the decay of U.53 The average number of neutrons emitted in the thermal-neutron-
induced ﬁssion of 235U is 2.47 as stated before, although it ﬂuctuates due to the
existence of various decay processes as shown in Fig.2.17.
The emitted neutrons are absorbed by the surrounding 235U, and successively
induce ﬁssion leading to a chain reaction.54 It is the principle of reactor to utilize
the nuclear energy by appropriately removing the emitted neutrons with an absorber
called control rod in order to keep the number of thermal neutrons in the space
constant, and thus by safely sustaining the chain reaction. A minimum condition is
needed for the amount of U fuel in order to sustain the chain reaction, which is called
the critical mass.
2.3.5.2
The Neutron Absorption Cross Section, Enriched Uranium,
and Neutron Moderator
The cross section of the neutron-induced ﬁssion of U strongly depends on the isotopes
and the energy of the incident neutron. Figure2.29 shows the neutron-induced ﬁssion
cross section of 235U and 238U (cited from [33], see also [34]). The ﬁgure shows that
238U does not cause ﬁssion unless the energy of neutron becomes as high as 1MeV.
This is the reason why no ﬁssion of 238U is seen in Fig.2.28. On the other hand,
the energy of thermal neutron 1/40eV is sufﬁcient to induce ﬁssion of 235U. The
difference between the threshold energies for the induced ﬁssion of 235U and 238U
originates from the pairing correlation between nucleons as stated before.
53Most of the neutrons are the prompt neutrons which are emitted at times shorter than 4 × 10−14 s.
Though the ratio of the delayed neutron is small, it plays an important role in controlling nuclear
reactors [6, 33, 34].
54It is Fermi and his collaborators who succeeded in the chain reaction of the induced ﬁssion of U
by a slow neutron for the ﬁrst time, and the experiment was performed at the University of Chicago
on December 2, 1942.

2.3 Nuclear Masses

ﬁssion cross section [33]
Because of this difference, the enriched uranium, which has the composition of
235U with a larger percentage than that of the naturally occurring uranium 0.720%,
is used as the fuel for reactors.55
Figure2.29 shows that the induced ﬁssion cross section of 235U decreases nearly
proportionally to the inverse of the velocity of the incident neutron v as the energy
of neutron increases (1/v-law). We learn the reason in Sect.9.3. On the other hand,
the energy spectrum of the neutrons emitted in the thermal neutron induced ﬁssion
of 235U can be well represented as
N(E) ∝
√
E exp(−E/E0) ∼
√
E exp(−E/1.29 MeV)
(2.81)
using the laboratory energy E, and distributes with its maximum at near E = E0/2 ∼
0.65MeV. Figure2.30 shows the laboratory neutron kinetic energy spectrum for
thermal neutron-induced ﬁssion of 235U. The average energy of the emitted neutrons
is ¯E = 1.5E0 ∼2MeV.56 Although these fast neutrons can induce ﬁssion of 238U,
the cross section is much smaller than that of the thermal neutron-induced ﬁssion
of 235U as Fig.2.29 shows. Moreover, the induced ﬁssion cross section of 235U by
high-energy neutrons is small, so that the cross section becomes effectively small.
The neutron moderator is therefore introduced in reactors so as to reduce the kinetic
energy of neutrons to that of the thermal neutrons.57
Exercise 2.15 Summarize why enriched uranium is used for nuclear reactors.
Sidebar: Natural Nuclear Fission Reactor A number of uranium ores, whose
isotope ratio of 235U is signiﬁcantly smaller than the standard value 0.720% in the
55In commercial reactors, the enrichment of 235U is typically about 3–4%.
56The center of mass energy spectrum of neutrons emitted from a nucleus in the excited state with
temperature T is expected to be given by εn exp(−εn/T ), and is well described by the theory called
the evaporation theory. The dashed line in Fig.2.30 represents the energy spectrum expected from
the evaporation theory transformed to that in the laboratory frame by taking into account the ﬁnite
velocity of the ﬁssion fragment.
57The reactor which uses high energy neutrons, instead of neutrons which have been cooled down
to thermal neutrons due to the elastic scattering in the neutron moderator, is called fast reactor or
fast neutron reactor.

2.3.5.3
Nuclear Waste Problem: Transmutation
Many of the ﬁssion products are radioactive nuclei with ﬁnite lifetimes as written
in Fig.2.28. In particular, the relatively long half-lives of 137
55 Cs and 90
38Sr are 30.14
and 28.78 years, respectively, which are of the same order as the human life span. In
addition, transuranium elements such as 237
93 Np, whose half-life exceeds 200 million
years, are produced. In the nuclear power industry this is a serious nuisance. These
radioactivities cause a biological hazard in discarded nuclear waste for a long time.
It is of critical importance to handle these long-lived nuclear wastes, and the studies
of nuclear transmutation are going on.
2.3.6
Fission Isomers
At the end of this section, let us learn about ﬁssion isomers. Figure2.31 shows the
excitation function of the neutron-induced ﬁssion of 230Th, i.e., 230
90 Th(n,f). Unlike
Fig.2.24, there appears a clear resonance structure with the width of 40keV at the
incident energy of neutron of about 720keV. Figure2.32 compares the excitation
functions of the 230
90 Th(n,f) and 230
90 Th(d,pf) reactions, which have been obtained by

The excitation function of ﬁssion will be a monotonic function if the potential
surface for ﬁssion has only a single barrier as predicted by the simple liquid-drop
modelandashasbeenshowninFig.2.19.Inreality,thepotentialsurfacehasmultiple-
barriers depending on the nucleus due to the shell correction energy representing the
shell effect. The situation is shown in Fig.2.33. It shows how the understanding for
the structure of ﬁssion barrier has evolved with time.58
The structure seen in Fig.2.31 was originally interpreted as the meta-stable β-
vibrational level produced in the second potential minimum. However, using the ﬁne
58One of the powerful methods to obtain the potential surface with multiple-potential barriers is the
macroscopic–microscopic method which modiﬁes the liquid-drop model by adding shell correction
(see Sect.7.6.1). In the ﬁssion of 231Th, the ﬁrst ﬁssion barrier is lowered by axial asymmetry. The
axial symmetry is recovered in the second ﬁssion barrier. However, the barrier height gets lower by
considering mass asymmetry, and furthermore there appears the third potential minimum.

Bulk Properties of Nuclei
Fig. 2.33 Time evolution of the theory for ﬁssion barrier, taken from [37]
structures seen in Fig.2.32 as the experimental evidence, these structures are now
understood to be associated with the rotational motion involving parity doublet, i.e.,
the positive and negative parity rotational bands, which have almost the same moment
of inertia, yielded in the third potential minimum associated with the mass asymmet-
ric ﬁssion [36, 38] (see the right-bottom curves in Fig.2.33). The position, width and
spin–parity of each resonance state shown in the ﬁgure have been determined by the
high-resolution measurement of the excitation function using, for example, the time
of ﬂight (TOF), the measurement of the angular distribution of ﬁssion fragments, the
simultaneous measurements of (n,f) and (d,pf) reactions, and the theoretical analyses
by the parity-doublet rotational model. The ratio of the length of the long axis to that
of the short axis obtained from the level splitting is 3:1, and matches the deformation
at the third potential minimum.59
Figure2.34 shows a few energy levels near the ground state of 238U and metastable
states in the second potential well together with their spin and parity. The latter states
are called ﬁssion isomers.
The ﬁssion isomers are a kind of either superdeformed states, which we learn
in Sect.7.6.2 and whose ratio of the length of the long axis to that of short axis is
about 1.6–1.8, or hyperdeformed states which have even larger ratio of the lengths
of two axes.60 As we learn in Chap.7, a characteristic of deformed states is that there
59The ratio of the length of the long axis to that of the short axis is 2:1 for the second potential
minimum.
60The ratio of the length of the long axis to that of the short axis is about 1.3 for usual deformed
nuclei such as the ground state of U. In comparison, the moment of inertia of ﬁssion isomers is 2.2

Chapter 3
The Nuclear Force and Two-Body Systems
Abstract The strong interaction between nucleons which is called the nuclear force
plays the central role in nuclear physics. Compared with the Coulomb interaction
between two charged particles, which plays the exclusive role in condensed matter
physics, the nuclear force is fairly complicated reﬂecting the fact that nucleons are
composite particles and have spin and isospin degrees of freedom. There are several
different approaches to uncover nuclear force. The one is to consider the most general
possibility under the constraints from the consideration of symmetry or transforma-
tion invariance. The other is a phenomenological approach. The meson theory is also
an attractive historical approach, which is often combined with phenomenological
approaches. Recently, approaches based on QCD are also introduced. A difﬁculty
of nuclear force is that the effective force inside nucleus is fairly different from the
bare interaction between two nucleons in free space. In this chapter we overview the
basic properties and the current understanding of the nuclear force.
3.1
The Fundamentals of Nuclear Force
3.1.1
The Range of Forces—A Simple Estimate
by the Uncertainty Principle
The four forces in nature, i.e., the gravitational force, the electromagnetic force, the
weak interaction and the strong interaction, can be thought to originate from exchang-
ing gauge particles, i.e., graviton, photon, weak bosons (W± and Z0 particles) and
mesons (or gluons at the more fundamental level of the quantum chromodynamics
(QCD)), which mediate each force, between two particles. Following this idea, one
can relate the range of each force to the mass of the corresponding gauge particles
using the uncertainty principle.
If we denote the mass of a gauge particle by m, then the uncertainty of the energy
associated with the propagation of the gauge particle is ΔE ∼mc2. Hence, the
correspondinguncertaintyoftimeisΔt ∼ℏ/ΔE ∼ℏ/mc2.Assumingthatthegauge
particle moves with the light velocity during that time interval, the range of the force
d can be estimated to be

and coincides with the Compton wavelength of the gauge particle. As is well known,
the electromagnetic force reaches inﬁnite distance, because the mass of photon is
zero. On the other hand, the range of the weak interaction is very short, since the
masses of W± and Z0 particles are large. If we assume that the strong interaction is
mediated by exchanging mesons as we learn later in the meson theory, the range of
the force which originates from the exchange of the lightest meson, i.e., π-mesons,
can be estimated to be about 1.4fm by using that the rest energy of the π-mesons is
about 140MeV. Incidentally, although the graviton has not yet been discovered, its
mass is expected to be zero, because the gravitational force has an inﬁnite range like
the electromagnetic force.
3.1.2
The Radial Dependence
Though we made a rough estimate of the range of forces using the uncertainty
principle in the previous section, the strength of the nuclear force acting between
two particles varies as a function of the distance between them similarly to that the
strength of the Coulomb interaction gets weaker in inverse proportion to the square
of the distance r between the two charged particles as their distance increases.
Corresponding to the fact that the strength of the Coulomb force is proportional
to 1/r2, the Coulomb potential is given by VC(r) = Q1Q2e2/r, where Q1e and Q2e
are the electric charges of the two charged particles. This formula can be derived by
thinkingthatoneofthechargedparticlesproducesanelectricﬁeldthroughinteraction
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and then exerts a force on the other charged particle
via the electric ﬁeld. The equation which determines the electric ﬁeld in this case is
known as the D’Alembert equation.
The same idea can be applied to the strong interaction. If we denote the ﬁeld of
the strong interaction by φ(r, t), then the equation called Klein–Gordon equation,
which is a generalization of the D’Alembert equation for the electric force, is given
by

φ(r, t) = −4πρ(r, t) ,
(3.2)
where m is the mass of the gauge particle. It is the mass of a meson in the meson theory
for the nuclear force. There appears on the left-hand side the Compton wavelength
of the gauge particle because of the ﬁniteness of the mass of the gauge particle. The
ρ(r, t) appearing on the right-hand side represents the density at the spatial position
r at time t of the charged particles which create the electric force in the D’Alembert
equation for the Coulomb potential. It is the density of hadrons such as nucleons,
which are the sources of mesons or gluons, in the case of the strong interaction.
In the static limit to ignore the time variation, the solution of Eq. (3.2) is given by

(3.6)

The nuclear potential φN(r) can be obtained by letting ρ(r′) = ρ0δ(r′) in the
integral on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.3) in the limit of ignoring the size of the
particle such as a nucleon which is the source of the force. Here, we took the position
ofthehadronwhichisthesourceoftheforceastheoriginofthespatialcoordinate.We
can see that the distance dependence changes from the 1/r law for the electric force
to e−μr/r with μ = mc/ℏ. This functional form including the exponential damping
factor is called the Yukawa type, and the strength of the nuclear force becomes
e−1 ≈1/2.7 in the distance of 1/μ. This distance corresponds to the range of the
force which we obtained in the previous section and coincides with the Compton
wavelength of the gauge particle.
3.1.3
The State Dependence of Nuclear Force
In the following, we discuss the interaction between two nucleons, called nuclear
force, among the strong interactions. Since each nucleon has the spin degree of

68

The Nuclear Force and Two-Body Systems
freedom, and also the degree of freedom in the isospin space, which has been touched
in Sect.1.2, in addition to that in the usual space, the nuclear force is much more
complex than the Coulomb force, and causes a great variety of phenomena. In this
section, we learn the classiﬁcation of the states of two-nucleon systems, the exchange
operators and the projection operators in preparation for studying more details about
the nuclear force.
3.1.3.1
The Classiﬁcation of the States of Two-Nucleon Systems
The wave function of two-nucleon systems ψ can be expressed as the product of the
wave functions in the usual space, the spin space and the isospin space as
ψ(x1, x2) = ϕ(r)ζ(s1, s2)η(t1, t2)
(3.8)
if there is no interaction between the coordinates in the usual and spin spaces such
as the spin–orbit interaction which we will learn in Sect.3.2.2. The s and t are the
z-components of the coordinates in the spin and isospin spaces, the lower indices
1 and 2 refer to the ﬁrst and the second nucleons, r ≡r1 −r2 is the coordinate for the
relative motion, r1 and r2 the spatial coordinates of the ﬁrst and the second nucleons,
respectively. Also, x is used to represent the coordinates in the usual, spin and isospin
spaces altogether simultaneously, i.e., x = (r, s, t).
If one uses the simultaneous eigenstates of the square ˆS2 of the total spin
ˆS ≡ˆs1 + ˆs2 and its z-component ˆSz, |S, Sz⟩, then the wave function in the spin space
ζ is one of the following states,
|1, 1⟩S = α1α2 ,
(3.9)
|1, 0⟩S =
1
√
2
[α1β2 + β1α2] ,
(3.10)
|1, −1⟩S = β1β2 ,
(3.11)
|0, 0⟩S =
1
√
2
[α1β2 −β1α2] .
(3.12)
We ignored the coordinates on the left-hand side, but used the index S to explicitly
indicate that it is the wave function in the spin space. On the right-hand side, we
expressed the coordinates s1 and s2 simply with the lower index 1 and 2. The α
and β represent the spin-up and spin-down states, | 1
2
1
2⟩and | 1
2 −1
2⟩, respectively.
The states with S = 1 and S = 0 are symmetric and antisymmetric concerning the
two nucleons, respectively, and does not change and changes the sign when the two
nucleons are interchanged. The former and the latter are called the spin-triplet and
the spin-singlet states, respectively.
Similarly, the wave function in the isospin space η can be expressed using the fol-
lowing simultaneous eigenstates of the square of the total isospin and the magnitude
of its z-component,

3.1 The Fundamentals of Nuclear Force
69
|1, 1⟩I = n1n2 ,
(3.13)
|1, 0⟩I =
1
√
2
[n1p2 + p1n2] ,
(3.14)
|1, −1⟩I = p1p2 ,
(3.15)
|0, 0⟩I =
1
√
2
[n1p2 −p1n2] ,
(3.16)
and each state can be classiﬁed into either isospin-triplet or isospin-singlet states.
The lower index I means isospin space. As deﬁned in Eq. (1.3), n and p represent
neutron (isospin-up) and proton (isospin-down) states, respectively.
On the other hand, the wave function for the relative motion can also be classiﬁed
into either symmetric or antisymmetric states with respect to the exchange of two
nucleons. Since the exchange of two particles corresponds to the parity transforma-
tion (or the parity inversion) of the coordinate of the relative motion r, the former
state is called E-state in the sense of even, while the latter O-state in the sense of
odd state. For example, if the wave function ϕ(r) is given by ϕ(r) = Rℓ(r)Yℓm(θ, φ)
by using the spherical harmonics Yℓm, then the states with an even number for the
orbital angular momentum ℓsuch as the s-wave are E-states, while those with odd-ℓ
values such as the p-wave are O-states.
Let us now represent the state for two-nucleon systems as 2T +1 2S+1E or 2T +1 2S+1O
when the total spin and the total isospin are S and T . The symbols E and O represent
the symmetry property, i.e., the even–odd property, of the wave function of the
relative motion. Since nucleons are fermions, the wave function of two-nucleon
systems has to change sign for the simultaneous coordinate interchange in the whole
space. Namely, ψ(x2, x1) = −ψ(x1, x2). Hence only the following four states, 13E,
31E, 11O, 33O, are allowed for two-nucleon systems. For example, 13E is called singlet
triplet even state. A characteristic of the nuclear force is that it signiﬁcantly differs
in these four states.
3.1.3.2
The Exchange Operators
(1) The Spin-Exchange Operator Various exchanges take place when two nucleons
interact. For example, when a proton in the spin-up state collides with another proton
in the spin-down state, the orientation of the spin is interchanged between them with a
certain probability (spin exchange). This happens because the nuclear force contains
terms which are proportional to the inner product ˆσ 1 · ˆσ 2 of the spins of the two
nucleons. We can rewrite the inner product as
ˆσ 1 · ˆσ 2 = 1
2(ˆσ1+ ˆσ2−+ ˆσ1−ˆσ2+) + ˆσ1z ˆσ2z
(3.17)
by using the raising and lowering operators of the spin. The spin exchange processes
are caused by the ﬁrst and the second terms on the right-hand side.

70
3
The Nuclear Force and Two-Body Systems
It is convenient to introduce the following operator in order to describe the spin
exchange effect,
Pσ = 1
2(1 + ˆσ 1 · ˆσ 2) .
(3.18)
One can easily show that Pσ|1M⟩S = |1M⟩S (M = 1, 0, −1) and Pσ|00⟩S =
−|00⟩S by operating Pσ on the spin-triplet and spin-singlet states. Since the
spin-triplet and spin-singlet states are symmetric and antisymmetric regarding the
exchange of the spins of two nucleons, this means that Pσ has the same function
as the exchange of the spins of the two nucleons. For this reason, Pσ is called the
spin-exchange operator, alternatively the Bartlett operator.
(2) The Charge-Exchange Operator The exchange of isospin can also occur in two-
nucleon systems. For example, a proton and a neutron are interchanged when they
collide (charge exchange). In order to describe this phenomenon, it is convenient to
introduce the following charge-exchange operator, which is also called the isospin-
exchange operator or the Heisenberg operator, by using the isospin operator τ of
each nucleon,
Pτ = 1
2(1 + ˆτ 1 · ˆτ 2) .
(3.19)
(3) The space-Exchange Operator (Majorana Operator) One can also consider
the operator which interchanges the coordinates of two nucleons in the usual space.
It is denoted by PM,
PMϕ(r) = ϕ(−r) .
(3.20)
Since the wave function for two-nucleon systems has to be antisymmetric in whole
space,
PMPτ Pσψ = −ψ .
(3.21)
Hence,
PMPτ Pσ = −1 .
(3.22)
One can therefore write
PM = −Pτ Pσ .
(3.23)
3.1.3.3
The Projection Operators
As we see later, the nuclear force strongly depends on the states of two nucleons
through the ˆσ 1 · ˆσ 2 and ˆτ 1 · ˆτ 2 terms in the nuclear force.
One often uses the projection operators deﬁned by
Πst ≡1
4(3 + ˆσ 1 · ˆσ 2) ,
Πss ≡1
4(1 −ˆσ 1 · ˆσ 2) ,
(3.24)
Πit ≡1
4(3 + ˆτ 1 · ˆτ 2) ,
Πis ≡1
4(1 −ˆτ 1 · ˆτ 2) ,
(3.25)

in order to explicitly show the state dependence of the nuclear force. The indices

isospin-triplet states and isospin-singlet state, respectively.

for the projection operator on the spin-triplet states.

(3.26)
3.2
The General Structure of Nuclear Force
One of the methods to construct nuclear force or nuclear potential is to take into
account various conservation laws suggested by fundamental experiments and to
consider the most general structure of the nuclear potential under those constraints.
Each conservation law is related to the invariance or symmetry under an associated
transformation. For nuclear force, one can ﬁrst list up that
• the potential is a scalar quantity,
• it is invariant under space reﬂection, i.e., Parity invariant,
• it is time reversal invariant
as the basic properties. Furthermore, the proton–proton and proton–neutron scatter-
ings at low energies suggest that the nuclear force is the same for the three states of
isospin triplets to a high accuracy. This is called the charge independence and implies
that the nuclear force is a function of the inner product of the isospins of two nucleons
ˆτ 1 · ˆτ 2. On the other hand, the way of thinking that the force between two neutrons
and that between two protons are the same is called the charge symmetry. The charge
symmetry and the charge independence are suggested also from the facts that the
energy levels of mirror nuclei, e.g., 15
7N8 and 15
8O7, very much resemble except for
the energy shift due to the Coulomb energy, and that there appear corresponding
energy levels among isobars such as 14
8 O6, 14
7 N7 and 14
6 C8.1
In this section, we give the general form of the nuclear potential based on the
considerations of the invariance or the symmetry.
3.2.1
Static Potentials (Velocity-Independent Potentials)
Let us ﬁrst consider the potentials, called static potentials, which do not depend on
the velocity of the relative motion between the nucleons.
1A group of energy levels which have the same J π but differ in the z-component of the isospin form

8 O6, 14
7 N7, and 14
6 C8.

72

The Nuclear Force and Two-Body Systems
3.2.1.1
Central Potentials
The static potentials can be classiﬁed into the central potentials, which depend only
on the distance r between the nucleons, and the noncentral potentials, which depend
on the angle of the relative coordinate r. The most general central static potential
can be written as
VC = V0(r) + (σ 1 · σ 2)Vσ(r) + (τ 1 · τ 2)Vτ(r) + (σ 1 · σ 2)(τ 1 · τ 2)Vστ(r)
(3.27)
by considering the symmetry and invariance conditions mentioned at the beginning of
this section. The strength and the functional form of V0(r), Vσ(r), Vτ(r) and Vστ(r)
cannot be determined by the consideration of symmetry alone. Equation (3.27) can
be rewritten as
VC = VW(r) + VM(r)PM + VB(r)Pσ + VH(r)Pτ ,
(3.28)
where the indices W, M, B and H stand for Wigner, Majorana, Bartlett, and
Heisenberg, respectively, or
VC = Vst(r) ˜Πst + Vts(r) ˜Πts + Vtt(r) ˜Πtt + Vss(r) ˜Πss
(3.29)
by using the exchange and projection operators. Here, ˜Πst is the projection oper-
ator on the isospin-singlet, spin-triplet states and is given by
˜Πst ≡Πis × Πst.
˜Πts, ˜Πtt, ˜Πss are deﬁned in a similar way. The radial functions in the different rep-
resentations are transformed as
VW = V0 −Vσ −Vτ + Vστ ,
VM = −4Vστ ,
VB = 2Vσ −2Vστ ,
VH = 2Vτ −2Vστ ,
(3.30)
and
Vts = VW + VM −VB + VH = V0 −3Vσ + Vτ −3Vστ ,
Vst = VW + VM + VB −VH = V0 + Vσ −3Vτ −3Vστ ,
Vss = VW −VM −VB −VH = V0 −3Vσ −3Vτ + 9Vστ ,
Vtt = VW −VM + VB + VH = V0 + Vσ + Vτ + Vστ .
(3.31)
Exercise 3.4 Show the relationships (3.30) and (3.31).

3.2 The General Structure of Nuclear Force
73
3.2.1.2
Noncentral Potentials
One can make an operator which satisﬁes the invariant conditions for nuclear force
in the following way,
S12 = 3(r · σ 1)(r · σ 2)
r2
−σ 1 · σ 2 ,
(3.32)
by using the relative coordinate r between the nucleons and the spin of each nucleon.
Equation (3.32) can be represented in the form,
S12 = (24π)1/2[[σ (1)
1
× σ (1)
2 ](λ=2) × Y2(ˆr)](0)
0
,
(3.33)
by using the notation of the tensor product. The S12 is therefore called the tensor
operator. Using the total spin of two-nucleon system,
S = 1
2 (s1 + s2) ,
(3.34)
S12 can be rewritten also as
S12 = 2

3(ˆS · r)2
r2
−ˆS
2

.
(3.35)
Equation (3.35) shows that S12 has a ﬁnite value only when it is operated on the
spin-triplet states. Hence one can represent the noncentral potential as
VT =
	
V even
T
(r)Π(T = 0, Leven) + V odd
T
(r)Π(T = 1, Lodd)

S12 ,
(3.36)
where Π(T = 0, Leven) and Π(T = 1, Lodd) are the projection operators on the
isospin 0, even parity states and on the isospin 1, odd parity states, respectively.
This force is called the tensor force. As the form of Eq. (3.32) shows, the tensor
force resembles the force acting between two magnetic dipoles. We learn later that
the tensor force is responsible for binding the deuteron among various two-nucleon
systems, and plays a vital role in the existence of nuclei, e.g., in locating the stable
nuclei along the diagonal line in the nuclear chart.
Exercise 3.5 Show Eqs. (3.33) and (3.35).
3.2.2
Velocity-Dependent Potentials
A representative of the velocity-dependent potentials is the spin–orbit interaction,
whose corresponding potential is given by

 ˆL · ˆS .
(3.37)
Here, ˆL is the angular momentum operator of the relative motion, and is given by
L = r × p = r × (p1 −p2) .
(3.38)
As we learn later, the spin–orbit interaction plays an important role in nuclear physics,
e.g., in governing the magic numbers.
3.3
The Properties of Deuteron and the Nuclear Force
3.3.1
The Effect of Tensor Force: The Wave Function
in the Spin–Isospin Space
Of two-nucleon systems, only deuteron is stable. Neither proton–proton nor neutron–
neutron bound state exists. In that sense, the deuteron is the simplest stable nucleus in
nature. The detailed analyses of the experiments concerning deuteron are therefore
important in obtaining various information on the nuclear force together with the
analyses of the nucleon–nucleon scatterings, which we learn in the next section.
We show in Table3.1 the properties of the deuteron in comparison with those of
the proton and the neutron.
As we learn in detail in Sect.3.6 (for example, see Fig.3.5), the central force is
attractive in distant regions for all two-nucleon systems. Moreover, it is stronger in
the spin-singlet state, to which proton–proton and neutron–neutron systems belong,
than in the spin-triplet states of deuteron. Nevertheless, only deuteron exists as a
stable state in nature. This is because even an attractive force cannot yield a stable

state unless it is strong enough in the three dimensional world governed by quantum
mechanics, and also because an extra attractive force leading to a stronger attraction
as a whole is added to deuteron due to the tensor force, since the spin of the deuteron
is 1. In order to demonstrate the mechanism why only deuteron is stable among two-
nucleon systems, Fig.3.1 shows an assembly of toys of magnetic dipoles ﬂoating on
the surface of oil. The directions of the magnetic dipoles shown by the arrows align
due to the interaction between the magnetic dipoles when two toys approach close
enough. Deuteron becomes stable for a similar reason. Since the nuclear force is of
short range, the relative motion between the two nucleons is desirable to be in the
s-wave which has a ﬁnite probability at zero distance in order to be stabilized by
the nuclear force. On the other hand, the wave function of two-nucleon systems has
to be antisymmetric in the usual, spin and isospin spaces as a whole with respect to
the exchange of two nucleons. Consequently, only deuteron which is in the isospin-
singlet state (spin-triplet states) and can supplement the insufﬁciency of the central
force by the tensor force becomes to exist in nature as a stable system.
Here, let us examine what information on the effects and magnitude of the ten-
sor force can be obtained from the magnetic and electric quadrupole moments of
deuteron, although the binding energy is an important quantity in determining the
nuclear force [4].
The operator of the magnetic moment of deuteron is given by (see Sect.4.1.1),
ˆμd = μp ˆσ p + μn ˆσ n + ˆLp ,
(3.39)
where Lp is the orbital angular momentum of proton and is given by Lp = L/2 by
using the angular momentum of the relative motion between proton and neutron L.
All the magnetic moments are given in units of the nuclear magnetic moment μN.
The ˆμd can be rewritten as
ˆμd =

by using the total angular momentum of deuteron J ≡L + 1
2(σ p + σ n) and L.2 As
we learn in Sect.4.3.2, the magnetic moment is deﬁned as the expectation value of
the z-component of ˆμ in the case when the z-component of the angular momentum
M takes its maximum value M = J,
μ = ⟨J M = J| ˆμz|J M = J⟩.
(3.41)
Since the operator of the magnetic moment is a tensor of rank 1, the value of the
magnetic moment becomes 0 and disagrees with the experimental data if one assumes
thatthespinofdeuteronis0.Forﬁnite J,theprojectiontheorem(seeAppendixA.6.4)
gives,
μ =
1
J + 1⟨J M = J| ˆμ · ˆJ|J M = J⟩,
(3.42)
The spin of deuteron is 1 as shown in Table3.1. This is due to the existence of the
tensor force, which mixes the L = 2 state (D-state) to the L = 0 state (S-state) for
the relative motion as Eq. (3.33) implies. If we denote the amplitude of the mixing
by αD, then the wave function of deuteron can be formally expressed as
|ψD⟩= |13S1⟩+ αD|13D1⟩,
(3.43)
where the lower index 1 shows that the magnitude of the total angular momentum J
is 1. Inserting Eq. (3.43) into the state |J M = J⟩in Eq. (3.42), we obtain
μ = μn + μp −3

(3.44)
where PD = |αD|2 represents the probability of D-state in deuteron.
The fact that the magnetic moment of deuteron is nearly equal to the sum of the
magnetic moment of the proton and that of the neutron in Table3.1 supports that the
spin of deuteron is 1, that is, the spins of the proton and the neutron in the deuteron are
aligned. Moreover, the difference between them suggests that the deuteron contains
the D-state by about 4%.
The admixture of the D-state means that the deuteron is deformed by that amount.
We learn in Chap.7 that the quadrupole moment of each nucleus gives a measure
of the deformation of the nucleus. The admixture of the D-state suggested by the
magnetic moment is consistent with the fact that the quadrupole moment is ﬁnite in
Table3.1.

The Radial Wave Function: Estimate of the Magnitude
of the Force Between Proton and Neutron
Let us next examine the radial wave function between proton and neutron. For sim-
plicity, we assume that the orbital angular momentum is zero. If we ignore the differ-
ence between the neutron and proton masses and represent the radial wave function
as R0(r) = u(r)/r, then the Schrödinger equation for u(r) is given by

where MN is the nucleon mass. If we further assume that the potential is a square
well potential of depth V0 and range a, then the equation can be analytically solved
and its solution is given by

Nucleon–Nucleon Scattering
Theneutron–protonandproton–protonscatteringdataprovideimportantinformation
on the nuclear force. The experimental data are given as the differential cross sections
and scattering cross sections. More detailed information on the spin dependence can
be obtained if one uses polarized projectile or polarized target [6]. Here, we discuss
the properties of nuclear force obtained from the scattering data of unpolarized beam
and target nucleus.
3.4.1
Low-Energy Scattering: Effective Range Theory
Let us consider the scattering of a neutron by a proton in order to avoid special
considerations needed to handle the long range Coulomb interaction. When both
neutron and proton are not polarized and their spins randomly orient all the directions
with equal probability, the state of two nucleons takes the spin-singlet state and the
spin-triplet states with the statistical weight 1:3. The experimentally obtained cross
section is therefore given by
σ = 1
4

σ (0) + 3σ (1)
(3.53)
if we denote the cross sections in the spin-singlet state and in the spin-triplet states
by σ (0) and σ (1), respectively.
Exercise 3.8 Show Eq. (3.53).
Exercise 3.9 Explain experimental methods to determine the cross section such as
the direct measurement and the measurement of the absorption cross section.
Let us study how the information on the nuclear force can be obtained from the
analysis of the scattering cross section. In general, the differential cross section is
given by
dσ
dΩ = | f (θ)|2
(3.54)
by using the scattering amplitude f (θ), where θ is the scattering angle. As we explain
in Appendix A.1, one of the standard methods to analyze the experimental data of
scattering is to make the partial wave expansion of the wave function and perform
the phase shift analysis. In this method, the scattering amplitude f (θ) is given by

k is the incident wave number.
In the case of scattering by a short range force, only the s-wave contributes to
the scattering if the incident energy of the scattering is sufﬁciently low. Namely, the
phase shift can be set equal to zero to a good approximation for the partial waves
ℓ≥1. This can be understood by noting that the angular momentum is given as the
product of the incident momentum and the impact parameter. If the incident energy is
low, the impact parameter becomes large for the partial waves ℓ≥1, hence becomes
outside of the range of the nuclear force. More important thing is that the s-wave
phase shift can be represented as
k cot δ = −1
a + 1
2k2re
(3.56)
by using two parameters irrespective of the details of the force (effective range theory
[7]). In other words, one can determine, at best, only two parameters from the data
of low-energy scattering. The parameters a and re are called the scattering length
and the effective range, respectively.
Exercise 3.10 Discuss the range of the incident energy for which only the s-wave
contributes to the scattering by assuming that the range of nuclear force is about 2fm.
We obtain
σ =
4πa2
(1 −reak2/2)2 + (ak)2
(3.57)
by inserting the result of Eq. (3.56) into the relationship between the cross section
and the phase shift. We can obtain the information on the scattering length and the
effective range by experimentally studying in detail the change of the cross section
at low energies as a function of the incident energy. An alternative way to determine
the scattering length with high precision is to use the cross sections of the scattering
of a thermal neutron by a proton, and by a parahydrogen molecule. Since the energy
of the thermal neutron3 is as low as 1/40eV, the cross section is given by
σthermal-neutron = π
	
3(a(1))2 + (a(0))2
(3.58)
by taking the limit of k →0. On the other hand, the cross section of the scattering
of the thermal neutron by a parahydrogen molecule4 is given by [8, 9]
σparahydrogen = π(3a(1) + a(0))2 .

One can determine a(1) and a(0) by using the observed values of these cross sections.

The following relation between the binding energy of deuteron, scattering length
and the effective range,
1
a(1) ≈α −1

e α2 ,
(3.60)
can be used in order to further determine the effective range for the spin-triplet states.
Here, α = [(MN/ℏ2)εD]1/2, εD being the binding energy of deuteron.
Table3.2 shows the scattering length and the effective range obtained from the
analyses of the low-energy scattering and deuteron [10–14]. It can be shown on the
way of derivation of the effective range theory, i.e., of Eq. (3.56) that there exist
bound states if the sign of the scattering length a is positive, while there exists no
bound state if it is negative. Hence the results shown in Table3.2 show that only
the isospin 0, spin-triplet states, i.e., deuteron, is stable, i.e., a bound state, of two-
nucleon systems. In this way, the nuclear force has a strong state dependence. Also, it
should be remarked that the scattering length is nearly equal in all the proton–proton,
neutron–neutron and neutron–proton scatterings which belong to the isospin-triplet
states (T = 1) (charge independence of the nuclear force).
The effective range theory tells that only two parameters on the nuclear force can
be determined from low-energy scattering data. However, it is convenient to have an
explicit expression of the functional form and the strength of the potential in order
to perform various calculations. Here we mention that there exist also such attempts.
Exercise 3.12 Assume that the nucleon–nucleon potential is given by the sum of
the central (VC) and the tensor (VT ) forces of the Yukawa-type, which have equal
weight of Wigner and Majorana terms,

in order to reproduce the experimental values of the effective range and the scattering
length in the spin-singlet and spin-triplet states.
3.4.2
High-Energy Scattering: Exchange Force
Equation (3.30) shows that the spin and isospin dependence of the nuclear force leads
to exchange forces. The existence of those exchange forces manifests itself in the
differential cross section of nucleon–nucleon scattering at high energies. Figure3.2
shows the angular distribution of neutrons scattered by protons in the neutron energy
range 85–105MeV. It is remarkable that a large amount of scattering takes place to
backward angles as well as to forward angles.

The Nuclear Force and Two-Body Systems
Let us now assume that the nuclear force contains only the Wigner force. Since one
can use the Born approximation for high-energy scattering, the scattering amplitude
is given by

to the momentum transfer. If we assume the Gauss-type for the form factor of the

(3.69)
Equation (3.69) shows that the cross section should monotonically decrease towards
backward angles if the nuclear force consists of the Wigner force alone. This con-
tradicts the experimental data shown in Fig.3.2.
In order to resolve this contradiction, let us assume that the nuclear force contains
a Majorana term
VM(r)PM ,
(3.70)
and examine its effect in the ﬁrst-order Born approximation. Since the scattering
amplitude is linearly proportional to the nuclear force in the ﬁrst-order Born approx-
imation, it gets an additional term,
fM(θ) = −MN

VM(r)r sin q′rdr
(3.71)
with
q′ = ki + k f ,
(3.72)
q′ = 2ki sin[(π −θ)/2] ,
(3.73)
due to the Majorana force. If we assume the Gaussian-type for VM(r) in the same
way as that for the Wigner force, the differential cross section increases with the
scattering angle. One can thus explain the large cross section at backward angles
appearing in the experimental data.5
5The Serber force, which is also called the Serber exchange force, is one of such forces. It consists
of the Wigner and the Majorana terms of the same sign with equal weight and is assumed to be
proportional to 1 + PM (see Table3.4).

3.4 Nucleon–Nucleon Scattering
83
3.4.3
High-Energy Scattering: Repulsive Core
Another characteristic of the nuclear force is that it becomes strong repulsion in
the close distance where two nucleons strongly overlap. This repulsive force in the
short distance is often called the repulsive core. As can be seen from the phase shift
analysis, the sign of the potential and the sign of the phase shift δ have a one to one
correspondence if the sign of V (r) is ﬁxed independently of the distance r, i.e., δ is
positive for attractive potentials and negative for repulsive potentials.
Figure3.3 shows the behaviour of the phase shift for several partial waves as a
function of the incident energy. Now, let us focus on the 31S0 channel (T = 1, S = 0,
L = 0 channel). The ﬁgure indicates that the potential for this channel behaves effec-
tively as an attractive potential in the scattering at low energies, while as a repulsive
potential in the scattering at high energies. If we consider the uncertainty relation
between the distance and the momentum, this implies that the nuclear potential
behaves as a repulsive potential at short distances, while as an attractive potential at
long distances. Figure3.4 represents this property in a simple way by combining a
square potential barrier and a square well potential.
In the following, we show that this simple model can well explain the energy
dependence of the phase shift, and that it gives an estimate of the extension of the
repulsive core. We ﬁrst note that the phase shift for the partial wave of the angular
momentum ℓis given by

scattering at low energies, where the conditions 2kc ≪1, 2ka ≫1 hold, we obtain
δ0(k) ≈MaV0
2ℏ2k > 0 ,
(3.80)
by ignoring the last term of Eq. (3.77) and approximating as sin(2kc)/2kc ≈1.
Equation (3.80) shows that the phase shift is positive. On the other hand, in the
scattering at high energies, where the conditions 2kc ≫1, 2ka ≫1 hold, we obtain
δ0(k) ≈−M
2ℏ2k (cV1 −bV0) < 0 ,
(3.81)
by ignoring the second and third terms in Eq. (3.77). Thus the phase shift becomes
negative. The radius of the repulsive core c is given by 2¯kc ≈1 if we denote the wave
number which corresponds to the critical energy Ecr

3.4.4
Spin Polarization Experiments
Since 1990s, experiments with polarized incident nucleons and/or target nucleus
became popular. Those experiments are very useful to obtain information on the
spin-dependent forces.
Suppose that the force between two nucleons is given by
V = f (r) (V0 + Vσσ 1 · σ 2) .
(3.82)
If we deﬁne the spin raising and lowering operators by
σ± ≡σx ± iσy
(3.83)
as is often done in the calculations concerning angular momentum, then the inner
product of the spins can be rewritten as
σ 1 · σ 2 = 1
2 (σ1+σ2−+ σ1−σ2+) + σ10σ20 .
(3.84)
The spin-ﬂip, i.e., the exchange of direction of spins between the incident and target
nucleons, takes place through the ﬁrst and the second terms on the right-hand side
of Eq. (3.84). Hence one can expect that detailed information on the spin-dependent
terms in the nuclear force can be obtained from the experiments related to the spin
polarization.
Exercise 3.13 Study methods to polarize the incident particle or the target nucleus.
Exercise 3.14 Consider the proton–neutron scattering by the following potential,
V = (1 + κ ˆσ 1 · ˆσ 2) f (r) ,
(3.85)
and assume that the proton and the neutron are in the spin-up and spin-down states,
respectively, at the beginning of the scattering. Obtain the probability of exchanging
the direction of spins between the proton and neutron at the end of the scattering
as a function of the strength of the spin-dependent term κ in the ﬁrst-order Born
approximation.

Microscopic Considerations: Meson Theory, QCD
In the meson theory, the force between two nucleons is assumed to work through
the exchange of various mesons such as π-mesons, ω-mesons and ρ-mesons. In this
section, we discuss the properties of the nuclear force from this point of view.
Let us ﬁrst derive the force which arises from the exchange of π-mesons. The ﬁrst
step is to properly postulate a Lagrangian density. Since the π-meson ﬁeld obeys the
Klein–Gordon equation, the corresponding Lagrangian is given by

Here, we used the natural unit (ℏ= c = 1). Π is the π-meson ﬁeld and the upper

components, respectively, and Π1, Π2, Π3 are related to the ﬁelds of three charge

π+ = (Π1 + iΠ2)/

π−= (π+)∗= (Π1 −iΠ2)/

On the other hand, the Lagrangian density for the interaction between nucleons and
pion ﬁelds are given by
L NR
int = gπϕ†σατ aϕ∇αΠa ,
(3.88)
in the non-relativistic approximation by considering that it is a scalar in the combined
spaces of the spin and usual space coordinates, it is scalar in the total isospin space
including both nucleons and pions, and that π-mesons are pseudoscalar particles.
ϕ is a two-dimensional spinor representing the nucleon ﬁeld, σ and τ are the spin
and isospin operators of nucleons, respectively. Corresponding to Eq. (3.88), the
interaction Hamiltonian is given by
H = −

gπϕ†σατ aϕ∇αΠadr .
(3.89)
It is necessary to determine the meson ﬁelds which mediate the force in order to
determine the interaction between two nucleons. They are determined by the Euler–

this equation has the same form as Eq. (3.2). The solution can be found as

Show that Eq. (3.88) can be obtained from Eq. (3.96) by introducing non-relativistic
approximations.
Equation (3.95) shows that the range of the nuclear force due to the exchange
of one pion is given by the Compton wavelength of π-meson and that the radial
dependence, i.e., the form factor, is given by the Yukawa function e−μr/μr. These
results agree with the conclusions obtained in Sects.3.1.1 and 3.1.2 based on the
uncertaintyprincipleandbymakingreferencetotheelectromagneticﬁeld.Ingeneral,
the range of the force due to the exchange of a meson of mass m is of the order
of the corresponding Compton wavelength ℏ/mc. Hence the contribution of the
exchange of heavier mesons such as ρ-meson, whose mass (more precisely the rest

energy) is 775.5MeV, ω-meson, whose mass is 782.7MeV, and σ-particles, whose
exchange corresponds to the exchange of two π-mesons, becomes non-negligible as
the distance between two nucleons decreases.
The meson theory has difﬁculty in discussing the nuclear force in the short range
region where the repulsive core appears. Another approach, called the quark clus-
ter model, has been developed instead. In this approach, the nucleon is thought to
consist of three quarks and the properties of nuclear force are studied microscopi-
cally by taking into account the effects of antisymmetrization among quarks [17].
We wish to mention that the study of nuclear force based on the chiral perturbation
theory (χPT) as an approximate theory (effective ﬁeld theory) for QCD [18], and
more recently, the study of nuclear force using the Monte Carlo calculation of QCD
deﬁned on the lattice (Lattice QCD calculation) [19] are also going on as alternative
approaches.

Phenomenological Potential with High Accuracy:
Realistic Potential
In parallel with the theoretical derivation of the nuclear force from microscopic
points of view, attempts to determine semi-phenomenological nuclear forces which
carry quantitative accuracy as well as high applicability have also been developed
by combining the phenomenology and meson theory. Historically, the Hamada–
Johnston potential [20] and the Reid hard-core and soft-core potentials [21],6 and
later, as reﬁned potentials, the Bonn potential [12], the Argonne potential [11], the
Paris potential [13], and the Nijmegen potential [14] are known as the representatives
of such semi-phenomenological potentials.
These potentials have common features that they have a repulsive core and are
described by OPEP in the distant region and contain many parameters. The parame-
ters are determined so as to reproduce the experimental data of the nucleon–nucleon
scattering at laboratory energies below 350MeV, and the properties of deuteron. In
that sense, they are often called realistic potentials. Each potential differs, e.g., in the
strength of the tensor force, the treatment of the medium and short distances, non-
locality, and off-shell effects. Table3.3 summarizes the key issues of determination
as well as the properties of these realistic phenomenological potentials. As Table3.3
shows, the reﬁned realistic potentials, i.e., Paris, Argonne v18, Bonn and Nijmegen
potentials, take into account the charge independence breaking (CIB)7 or the charge
6We name the potentials whose height of the repulsive core is inﬁnite and ﬁnite the hard- and the
soft-core potentials, respectively.
7One of the main reasons of the CIB is the difference of the masses of three π-mesons.

Here, we explain the Hamada–Johnston and Reid potentials which have relatively
concise expressions and are convenient to see the bulk properties of the nuclear force.
3.6.1
Hamada–Johnston Potential
Figure3.5 shows the Hamada–Johnston potential. The Reid hard core potential
resembles the Hamada–Johnston potential qualitatively.
The Hamada–Johnston potential postulates a repulsive core of inﬁnite height for
the short distance inside of r = rC = 0.49fm, and assumes that the potential is given
by
V = VC(μr) + VT (μr)S12 + VLS(μr)L · S + VLL(μr)L12
(3.97)
in the region outside of the core. Here, the operator of the spin-orbit interaction of
the second order L12 is deﬁned as
8The details of the treatment and the accuracy depend on the potential. For example, the Nijmegen
potential takes into account only a part of the charge symmetry breaking (CSB), while the Argonne
potential v18 handles the CSB phenomenologically.

The position of the hard core rC depends on the total isospin of two nucleons, and
is taken as rC = 0.42fm for the 1S state and 0.43fm for the other states in the case
when T = 1, and rC = 0.55fm for the T = 0 state. The Reid soft-core potential
represents the effect of repulsive core by using a Yukawa function of short-range
repulsive type.
The parameters aC, . . . , bLL in the Hamada–Johnston potential and an, bn, cn in
the Reid potential are determined phenomenologically through the analyses of the
experimental data.

Summary of the Nuclear Force in the Free Space
Let us here summarize the nuclear force in the free space, i.e., the nuclear force
obtained from the analyses of the nucleon–nucleon scattering and of deuteron.
Figure3.6 shows how various nuclear forces such as the central and tensor forces
vary with the distance r between two nucleons. They are shown separately for each
state of the two-nucleon systems such as 31E and 11O.10 The ﬁgure shows also the
mesons which contribute to the nuclear force in each spatial region.
The main characteristics of the nuclear force appearing in the ﬁgure can be sum-
marized as follows.
1. The nuclear force is of short range in contrast with the gravitational force and the
electromagnetic force. Note that the unit of the abscissa is 10−15m.
10The even–odd property of the spatial motion and the spin multiplicity are shown in the ﬁgure.
The triplet and singlet in 3E and 1E represent the multiplicity in the spin space.

2. The long distance region is governed by the one-pion exchange potential (OPEP),
and is attractive.
3. It turns to a strong repulsion in the short distance, where two nucleons overlap.
4. It strongly depends on the state of two-nucleon systems through, e.g., the tensor
force. For example, of the two-nucleon systems, it is only deuteron, whose total
isospin is 0 and total spin is 1, for which the attraction is strong enough to yield
a bound state.

Effective Interaction Inside Nucleus
3.8.1
G-Matrix
Further considerations are necessary in order to use for the studies of nuclear structure
and nuclear reactions even if the bare nuclear force, i.e., the nuclear force acting
between two nucleons in isolation, i.e., in the free space, is known. Although there
existsomevariationsdependingoneachpotential,aswelearntintheprevioussection,
the short range part of the nuclear force is represented either by a repulsive core of
inﬁnite strength or a strong repulsive core even if it is not inﬁnite. If we use the

3.8 Effective Interaction Inside Nucleus
93
Fig. 3.7 Conceptual representation of the G-matrix. The wavy line and the dotted line represent G
and the bare potential V , respectively
bare nuclear force with a hard core as it is, e.g., in the mean-ﬁeld theory, which is a
standard theory for studying nuclear structure, we get into trouble of the divergence
of the matrix elements of the interaction.
One of the methods to circumvent the difﬁculty associated with the fact that the
nuclear force is strong, e.g., the problem of hard core, is the G-matrix theory, in other
words the Brueckner theory [25]. In this method, one uses not the bare nuclear force,
but the effective nuclear force called G-matrix, which takes into account the effects
of multiple scattering and Pauli principle, as the interaction between nucleons in
performing the theoretical calculations of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions.11
Figure3.7 conceptually represents the G-matrix. In the case of the free space, the
effective interaction which takes into account the multiple scattering is called the
T -matrix, and is given by
T = V + V
1
E −K1 −K2 + iε T ,
(3.109)
in the operator representation when the total energy of the two-nucleon system is E.
By repeating the insertion of the whole right-hand side to the T on the right-hand
side of Eq. (3.109), one will be able to understand that T is the effective interaction
which takes into account multiple scattering. K1, K2 are the kinetic energy operators
of the nucleons 1 and 2 in the intermediate states.
The G-matrix can be thought to be the extension of the T -matrix to the nuclear
force inside nucleus. The important changes from the case of free space are to take
into account the Pauli exclusion principle so as to exclude the states which are
already occupied by the other nucleons from the intermediate states of nucleons
in the multiple scattering, and to use the energy in the medium in calculating the
propagator. Consequently, the G-matrix is given by the following equation,
G = V + V
Q
E −H (0)
1
−H (0)
2
G ,
(3.110)
where Q is the operator to restrict the intermediate states by following the Pauli
exclusion principle. H (0)
1
and H (0)
2
are the unperturbed Hamiltonian, and correspond,
e.g., to the Hamiltonian of the mean ﬁeld in the shell model. Equation (3.110) is called
the Bethe–Goldstone equation.
11The G-matrix theory is not the standard Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory, but a pertur-
bation theory which takes into account special higher-order terms, i.e., the ladder scattering.

Leaving the details of the G-matrix theory to other books [25], here we remark
that the effective interaction inside nucleus becomes density dependent through the
Fermi energy εF which appears on the right-hand side of Eq. (3.112) in order to
restrict the intermediate states (see Sect.2.2 as for the relation between the Fermi
energy and the density).
3.8.2
Phenomenological Effective Interaction
As we have hitherto studied, it is not easy to determine the nuclear force exactly,
and to perform the study of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions from the point
of view of many-body problems based on the nuclear force determined from more
fundamental points of view such as the meson theory and QCD. The studies using
handy phenomenological interactions have therefore also been developed in parallel
with the studies based on the practical phenomenological nuclear force with high
accuracy described in Sect.3.6 and those based on the G-matrix theory. Those phe-
nomenological potentials consist of several effective terms such as a strong exchange
term (Majorana term) to guarantee the saturation property of density, and/or the term
which takes the density dependence into account referring to the G-matrix theory.
Here,wementionsomeexamplesofthosephenomenologicaleffectiveinteractions.12
12As is clear from the projection operator method [26] by Feshbach. The effective interaction used
in a theoretical calculation depends on the size of the model space which is explicitly taken into
account in that calculation. The unitary model operator approach (UMOA) is one of such theoretical
approaches [27].

Examples of the Radial Form Factor and Exchange Property
The radial form factor of the nuclear force is often assumed to be either the Yukawa-
type or the Gauss-type as described below, or a sum of those terms with different
range parameters,

(Yukawa potential),

As for the exchange property, we show the cases of Serber and Rosenfeld forces in
Table3.4 as representative examples.
3.8.2.2
Effective Interactions Used for Variational Calculations
of Light Nuclei
Here, we mention the Volkov interaction [28], which is often used for the study of
cluster structure of light nuclei by variational methods, as an example of the effective
interaction,13
V (r) =

−V1e−(r/r1)2 + V2e−(r/r2)2
(1 −m + mPM) ,
(3.115)
where V1 = V2 = 60MeV,r1 = 1.80fm,r2 = 1.01fm. The Majorana exchange term
is used to guarantee the saturation of nuclei in the Volkov force. Regarding the cluster
structure of light nuclei, larger values of m predict more distinct cluster structure.
13The Brink–Boeker force [29], the Hasegawa–Nagata force [30], and the Minnesota force [31]
have also been often used. These forces are common in assuming the radial factor of Gaussian type
so that the calculations of the matrix elements using the wave functions of the harmonic oscillator
model can be easily performed. The Hasegawa–Nagata force has a characteristic that it contains the
spin–orbit force and the tensor force. Except for the Minnesota force, they determine the parameters
so as to reproduce the radii and the relative binding energies of some light nuclei. The Minnesota
force determines the parameters so as to reproduce the scattering data. The characteristics of various
effective interactions and the way to calculate the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian when the
wave function is given by a Slater determinant are described in detail in [32].

Chapter 4
Interaction with Electromagnetic Field:
Electromagnetic Moments
Abstract As mentioned in Chap.1, by measuring the magnetic moment of proton,
Stern showed that the proton is not an ideal point particle which can be described
by the Dirac equation. Also, we learnt in Chap.3 that the magnetic moment of
deuteron tells that deuteron is in the spin-triplet and isospin-singlet states, and that
one can get information on the magnitude of the tensor force through the admixture
of the D-state in deuteron. In this way, the electromagnetic properties of nuclei
provide valuable information on the structure of nucleons and nuclei. Also, the
interaction of nuclei with the radiation ﬁeld leads to the emission and absorption
of a γ -ray, governs the lifetime of each energy level, and provides information on
the nuclear structure as well as nuclear collective motions through the strength of
the electromagnetic transitions between nuclear levels. Furthermore, the measure-
ment of the angular correlation between the cascade γ -rays enables us to determine
the spin of each energy level. The electromagnetic transitions play an important
role also in the synthesis of elements through, e.g., the radiative neutron capture
(see Cottingham and Greenwood, An Introduction to Nuclear Physics, 2nd edn.
(Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2001); Thompson and Nunes, Nuclear
Reactions for Astrophysics: Principles, Calculation and Applications of Low-Energy
Reactions (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2009) [1, 2]). In this chapter
we learn the electromagnetic moments such as the magnetic dipole moment and the
quadrupole moment which provides important information on the nuclear shape. The
electromagnetic transitions by emitting γ -rays will be discussed in Sect.8.3 after we
learn about nuclear structure in Chaps.5 and 7.

4.1.1
Operators for the Dipole and Quadrupole Moments
The electric charge density ρC and the electric current density j in Eqs.(4.4)–(4.6)
must be considered as the operators ˆρC and ˆj in order to compare the experimental
values of these multipole moments and the related transition probabilities with their
theoretical values. As we describe in Chaps.5 and 7 and in Sect.8.3, there exist
various ways such as the microscopic methods, e.g., the shell model, which uses
the nucleonic degrees of freedom, and the collective model which uses the surface
deformation parameters as coordinates to describe nuclear structure and nuclear
reactions. Since ˆρC and ˆj are needed to be expressed in terms of relevant coordinates,
their explicit expressions change depending on the model or the method we take
to describe nuclear structure or reactions. Here, we explicitly write down ˆρC and ˆj
by assuming that we adopt a microscopic model which uses the nucleonic degrees
of freedom. If we treat each nucleon as a point particle, and represent the spin and
isospin of the k-th nucleon as ˆsk and ˆtk, then they are given by

gs is called the spin g-factor. We use the values of the anomalous magnetic moments
gn = 2μn/μN = −3.826 and gp = 2μp/μN = 5.586 discussed in Chap.1 for gn
and gp. The ﬁrst and second terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(4.10) are called
the convection current and the magnetization current, respectively. The former is
the usual electric current due to the orbital motion of protons, while the latter the
electric current associated with the magnetic moments of protons and neutrons.
Equation (4.10) can be derived from the Dirac equation, which the Fermi particle
should obey, by making non-relativistic approximation.

these properties, derive Eq.(4.10).

Various Corrections
To make discussions with high accuracy, one must take into account various cor-
rections such as (1) the effect of the ﬁnite size of proton, (2) that the velocity
ˆvk ≡i
ℏ[ ˆH, ˆrk] deviates from ˆpk/MN in the presence of velocity dependent forces
such as the spin–orbit interaction, (3) the effect of meson exchange current, i.e.,
that the electromagnetic ﬁeld operates on the mesons exchanged between the nucle-
ons, (4) the quenching effect, i.e., that the anomalies of the magnetic moment of
nucleons get reduced inside nucleus because of the Pauli exclusion principle, and (5)
relativistic effects.
4.1.3
Measurement of the Magnetic Moment: Hyperﬁne
Structure
The detailed study of the energy levels of atoms shows that the level structure is more
complex than what is expected from the motion of the electron alone. An additional
structure called the hyperﬁne structure appears. Consider a nucleus with an odd mass
number. The spin of the nucleus is a half integer. We represent the corresponding
nuclear spin operator as ˆI. The magnetic moment operator of the nucleus ˆμnucleus
is then given by ˆμnucleus = gμN ˆI by using the g-factor. The energy levels of the
whole atom including both electrons and the nucleus split into close-lying energy
levels due to the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld made by the electron on this nuclear
magnetic moment. This is why the hyperﬁne structure arises in the level structure.
As an example, Fig.4.1 shows the low-lying energy levels of a neutral hydrogen
atom [3].
As one can expect from the above arguments, the study of hyperﬁne structure is a
powerfulmethodtodeterminethemagnitudeofthemagneticmomentofthenucleus.1
In the following, let us study somewhat in detail the principle of the method.
If we denote the magnetic ﬁeld made by electrons by ˆHe, then the interaction
Hamiltonian between the electrons and the nucleus is given by
ˆHhyperﬁne = −ˆμnucleus · ˆHe .
(4.19)
1Stern developed a tenuous molecular beam method in order to realize the interaction-less situation
which is often postulated in idealized theoretical arguments. He discovered the anomalous magnetic
moment of proton by the experiment which sends the tenuous stream of molecules through an inho-
mogeneous magnetic ﬁeld similarly to the Stern–Gerlach experiment which showed experimentally
the quantization of spatial orientation of angular momentum.

4.1 Hamiltonian of the Electromagnetic Interaction …
101
Fig. 4.1 Low-lying energy levels of atomic hydrogen. Taken from [3]
To be speciﬁc, let us consider either the hydrogen atom or an alkali atom, where
the orbital angular momentum of the outer electron is 0 in the ground state. In that
case, ˆHe is given by [4]
ˆHe = −16π
3 μB|ψ(0)|2ˆs ,
(4.20)
if we denote the Bohr magneton by μB, the value of the wave function of the outer
electron at the origin by ψ(0), and the spin operator of the outer electron by ˆs. Hence,
we have
ˆHhyperﬁne = ˆHspin–spin = 16π
3 gμNμB|ψ(0)|2(ˆs · ˆI) .
(4.21)
Equation (4.21) shows that each energy level splits into two energy levels by the
presence of the inner product (ˆs · ˆI). In order to emphasize this feature, the index spin–
spin has been attached to the Hamiltonian operator in the second term of Eq.(4.21)
in the sense of spin–spin interaction.
Equation (4.21) can be used to deduce the g-factor from the measurement of
the hyperﬁne splitting. Thus the magnetic moment can be determined. Note that the
probability for electrons to exist at the origin is ﬁnite for s-orbits. In general, the
operator of the magnetic interaction of the electrons with the nucleus is of the form
of ˆHJ I = a(ˆJ · ˆI) if the total spin of the electrons is denoted by ˆJ. Hence each energy
level with given J splits into either 2I + 1 levels if I ≤J or 2J + 1 levels if I ≥J.
One can therefore obtain information on J and I by counting the number of energy
levels appearing in the hyperﬁne structure.2
2The energy spacing between successive energy levels labeled with the value of the total spin
ˆF = ˆJ + ˆI in the hyperﬁne structure deviates from the rule expected from the (ˆJ · ˆI) factor for the
magnetic hyperﬁne splitting considered in this section due to the quadrupole hyperﬁne splitting
if the quadrupole moment of the nucleus is ﬁnite. In other words, deviations of the level interval
from the interval rule for the magnetic hyperﬁne structure provide important information on the
quadrupole moment or the shape of the nucleus.

Exercise 4.3 Show that the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld made by the electron at the
position of nucleus is 105–106 Gauss depending on the species of atom by obtaining
the magnitude of |ψ(0)|2 as a function of the atomic number Z and the principal
quantum number n by using the wave function of the hydrogen atom.
Exercise 4.4 Besides the study of hyperﬁne structure, there exist various methods
to measure the magnetic moment such as the method of nuclear magnetic resonance,
molecular beam method, Rabi’s molecular beam resonance method (Rabi’s refocus
method) and the perturbed angular correlation method (PAC). Study the principle
and features of each method.
4.2
Electromagnetic Multipole Operators
It is convenient to begin with the generalized deﬁnition in order to discuss in a
uniﬁed way not only the low-order moments introduced in Sect.4.1.1, but also all
the electromagnetic properties of nuclei including higher-order multipole moments
as well as the emission and absorption of photons.
Let us ﬁrst consider the static electric potential φ(r) made by a nucleus in the far
distance from the nucleus. We denote the proton density inside the nucleus by ρp(r).
Using the formula of the multipole expansion of 1/|r −r′| for the case of r > r′, we
have

We used A · (B × C) = B · (C × A) = C · (A × B) and the relationship j(r) =
c∇× μ(r) in order to transform from Eq.(4.25) to (4.26).
By inserting the results of Eqs.(4.9) and (4.10) into Eqs.(4.23) and (4.26), we
obtain the expressions for the electromagnetic multipole operators in terms of nucle-
onic coordinates as

Properties of the Electromagnetic Multipole Operators
4.3.1
Parity, Tensor Property and Selection Rule
4.3.1.1
Parity
If we denote the operator of the Parity transformation, which inverts all spatial coor-
dinates, by
ˆ
P, and represent the coordinate using the polar coordinates (r, θ, ϕ), the
deﬁnition of
ˆ
P,
ˆ
P(r, θ, ϕ) ˆ
P−1 ≡(r, π −θ, ϕ + π) ,
(4.29)
leads to
ˆ
PYλμ(r, θ, ϕ) ˆ
P−1 = Yλμ(r, π −θ, ϕ + π) = (−1)λYλμ(r, θ, ϕ) .
(4.30)
Equations (4.27) and (4.28) therefore give the following properties of the electric
and magnetic multipole operators concerning the parity transformation,
ˆ
P ˆQλμ ˆ
P−1 = (−1)λ ˆQλμ ,
(4.31)
ˆ
P ˆMλμ ˆ
P−1 = (−1)λ+1 ˆMλμ .
(4.32)
Note that both the spin and the angular momentum operators are invariant under the
parity transformation.
4.3.1.2
Tensor Property
Furthermore, it can be derived from Eqs.(4.27) and (4.28) that both ˆQλμ and ˆMλμ
are the μ component of a rank-λ tensor. The former can be easily proved by noting
that it is directly proportional to the spherical harmonics Yλμ and that Yλμ is the μ

Interaction with Electromagnetic Field: …
component of a rank-λ tensor. The latter looks complicated at ﬁrst glance because
of the existence of the inner product of vector operators in front of Yλμ. However,
the tensor property does not change and is identical with that of Yλμ, since the inner
product of two vectors is a scalar, i.e., a rank-0 tensor. Details of tensor algebra are
given in Appendix A.6.
4.3.1.3
Selection Rule
It is necessary to calculate the expectation values of multipole operators in order to
compare the experimental values of the multipole moments with theoretical values.
If we represent the nuclear state as |ψI M⟩, where I and M are the magnitude of the
angular momentum and its z-component in the space-ﬁxed coordinate system, then
the expectation values of multipole operators are deﬁned by
Qλμ = ⟨ψI M| ˆQλμ|ψI M⟩,
(4.33)
Mλμ = ⟨ψI M| ˆMλμ|ψI M⟩.
(4.34)
The following selection rules can be obtained from the parity and tensor properties
of the multipole operators mentioned above,
Qλμ = 0 (for odd λ),
(4.35)
Mλμ = 0 (for even λ),
(4.36)
Qλμ, Mλμ ̸= 0 (only when μ = 0 and 0 ≤λ ≤2I).
(4.37)
Equations (4.35) and (4.36) hold when one constructs the wave function |ψI M⟩by
considering only the strong interaction, because |ψI M⟩then has a deﬁnite parity.
4.3.2
Deﬁnition of the Electromagnetic Moments
4.3.2.1
Wigner–Eckart Theorem
If we represent the μ component of a rank-λ tensor as ˆTλμ, the following theorem
called the Wigner–Eckart theorem holds,3
⟨βI2M2| ˆTλμ|αI1M1⟩= (2I2 + 1)−1/2⟨I1λM1μ|I2M2⟩⟨βI2∥ˆTλ∥αI1⟩.
(4.38)
Equation (4.38) implies that it is sufﬁcient to know the matrix element for a particular
z-component in order to fully determine the matrix elements of a tensor operator. The
3There exists an alternative deﬁnition which omits the factor (2I2 + 1)−1/2 on the right-hand side.

4.3 Properties of the Electromagnetic Multipole Operators
105
matrix elements for the other z-components are automatically determined according
to the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients.
4.3.2.2
Magnetic Dipole Moment
Since the operator of the magnetic dipole moment is a tensor of rank-1, we deﬁne
the magnetic dipole moment which should be compared with the experimental
data by
μ ≡⟨I I| ˆμz|I I⟩
(4.39)
=

4π
3 ⟨I I| ˆM10|I I⟩,
(4.40)
following the Wigner–Eckart theorem.4
4.3.2.3
The Electric Quadrupole Moment
Similarly we deﬁne the electric quadrupole moment by
Q ≡

16π
5 ⟨I I| ˆQ20|I I⟩.
(4.41)
The tensor component indices of both the wave functions and the operator in
Eq.(4.41) refer to the space-ﬁxed coordinate system, i.e., the laboratory system.
On the contrary, in the case of a statically deformed nucleus, one deﬁnes the intrinsic
electric quadrupole moment by
Q0 ≡

(4.42)


ρp(r′)(3z′2 −r′2)dr′ ,
(4.43)
by taking the axes of the coordinate system along the directions of the principal axes,
i.e., by taking the body-ﬁxed coordinate frame (or the intrinsic coordinate system).
For example, if the nucleus is a spheroid, Q0 is given by
Q0 = 2

(4.46)
by using the length of the semi-axis in the direction of the symmetry axis a and that
in the perpendicular direction b, and the deformation α2 and the radius parameters
R0 introduced in Eq.(2.66). These equations show that one can learn the shape of the
nucleus, more precisely the shape of the distribution of protons inside the nucleus,
if information on the intrinsic electric quadrupole moment can be obtained. Q0 > 0
and Q0 < 0 mean the shapes prolonged and shrunk in the direction of the symmetry
axis and are called prolate and oblate shapes, respectively. In Eq.(4.46), we used
the deformation parameter α20, which we will introduce in Chap.7, and ignored the
second order term with respect to α20.
What one measures experimentally is not the value of Q0, but that of Q. If a
nucleus is axial-symmetrically deformed, the component of the angular momentum
projected on the symmetry axis, K, becomes a good quantum number in addition to
the magnitude of the angular momentum I and its component along the space-ﬁxed
z-axis M. In this case, for even–even nuclei or for odd nuclei, where all nucleons
rotate simultaneously5 and I = K = 1/2 or K ≥3/2, one can prove that Q and Q0
are related as
Q = Q0
3K 2 −I (I + 1)
(2I + 3)(I + 1) .
(4.47)
Especially, if I = K as in the case of the ground state,
Q =
I
I + 1
2I −1
2I + 3 Q0 .
(4.48)
Equation (4.48) shows that Q = 0 irrespective of Q0 if I = 0 or 1/2. This result
can be expected from the coupling rule of angular momenta or of tensors and the
orthogonality of states with different values of angular momentum. The derivation
of Eq.(4.47) is given in Appendix A.7.

5There exist two possibilities for odd nuclei. In one case, the core part made from even–even
nucleus makes a collective rotation, while the last odd nucleon moves almost independently from
this motion. In the other case, both the core and the last nucleon rotate together as a whole. The
former and the latter are called weak coupling and strong coupling states, respectively.

Shell Structure
Abstract Although the bulk properties of nuclei such as the mass and size, and
also ﬁssion and the compound nucleus reactions suggest that the nucleus behaves
like a liquid, there exist characteristic properties which cannot be understood from
such a point of view. The existence of magic numbers in various phenomena is the
most evident example, suggesting the shell structure. The magic numbers appear
in various systems in nature. The existence of the noble gases in the periodic table
of the elements is the most popular example. Contrary to those magic numbers for
atoms, which are associated with the long range Coulomb interaction, the magic
numbers for nuclei which originate from the short range force differ in numbers.
Also, the spin–orbit interaction plays a crucial role in the magic numbers for nuclei.
In this chapter we discuss how the magic numbers arise, and discuss the spin and
parity properties of the nuclei in the vicinity of magic numbers. Although the shell
model which is based on the mean-ﬁeld theory succeeds, it is suggested that it is
important to take into account the effects of the residual interaction, i.e., the pairing
correlation in order to explain the details of the nuclear phenomena. As an example
of the current topics, we also discuss the present status of the research of superheavy
elements which are stabilized by shell effects.

Magic Numbers
The saturation properties of density and binding energy per nucleon suggest the
validity of the liquid-drop model for nuclei. The mass formula is also based on the
picture of a nucleus as a liquid drop, and various basic properties of ﬁssion can be
explained based on the liquid-drop model. Also, the compound nucleus reaction, one
of the representative nuclear reactions, strongly supports the validity of the liquid-
drop model for nuclei.
The liquid-drop model is the picture that physical quantities vary continuously
or monotonically as functions of the mass and atomic numbers and that there exist

neither special mass number nor special proton and neutron numbers. However, there
exist many experimental data which contradict this picture. We mention here some
of the examples.
Figure1.7 shows that the nuclei whose neutron number N is 50, 82, or 126 exist
signiﬁcantly more than the surrounding nuclei. Figure2.6 and more detailed analysis
of the binding energy show that the nuclei whose proton number and/or neutron
number are one of 20, 28, 50, 82, 126 have larger binding energy per nucleon than
the other nuclei whose binding energy can be well represented by the mass formula
and are more stable than them. Also, as stated concerning Fig.2.17, most of the
spontaneous ﬁssion and the induced ﬁssion at low energies are asymmetric ﬁssion,
where the mass number and the atomic number of the ﬁssion products which have
largeyieldarerelatedtothespecialnumbersmentionedabove.AswelearninChap.7,
the shape of nucleus is also intimately related to the mass and atomic numbers, and
the shape of the nucleus whose proton number and neutron number are one of the
special numbers mentioned above is spherical, i.e., the absolute value of their intrinsic

and neutron numbers are both 2 or 8, respectively, are much more stable than the
surrounding nuclei.
In this way, 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126 are special numbers for nuclei and are called
magic numbers.1
Sidebar: The Connection Between the Magic Numbers and Life The atomic
numbers 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 86 of the noble gases in the periodic table of the elements
can also be thought to be the magic numbers of atoms. The respiration of organism
is guaranteed by the rich abundance of oxygen thanks to the fact that the magic
number for nuclei is not 10, but 8. As we learn in the next section, the change of
the magic number from 10 to 8 is caused because of the short range character of
the nuclear force. If the nuclear force were not of short range, organism could not
sustain respiration, i.e., could not obtain energy by reacting oxygen with glucose,
and should have got into serious trouble or had to rely upon some different processes
to obtain energy.
1The magic numbers can be thought to be the proton and/or neutron numbers for which the nucleus
becomes spherical, or those at which the binding energy per nucleon, i.e., the separation energy of
a nucleon, becomes particularly large compared with that in the surrounding nuclei, or the proton
and neutron numbers at which the nuclear radius suddenly changes as a function of the proton and
neutron numbers. If we consider in this way, the magic number is determined by the combination of
the proton and neutron numbers, and the magic numbers for nuclei which are unstable with respect
to β-decay such as neutron-rich unstable nuclei or neutron-deﬁcient nuclei, so-called proton-rich
nuclei, can be different from the known magic numbers for stable nuclei. The change of magic
numbers or the appearance of new magic numbers in the region of unstable nuclei is one of the
central research subjects in current nuclear physics.

Theory
5.2.1
The Mean Field
The magic numbers for atoms can be explained based on the picture that electrons are
moving independently in the Coulomb ﬁeld VC made by the nucleus. In this picture,
the central roles are played by the facts that the Coulomb ﬁeld is of long ranged and
the functional form is given by the inverse of the distance from the center r and the
Pauli exclusion principle.
Let us derive the magic numbers for nuclei by similarly assuming that nucleons
are moving independently from each other inside the nucleus, but obeying the Pauli
exclusion principle. However, there exists no central particle which governs the force
like the nucleus for electrons inside an atom. Instead, we assume that each nucleon
is moving in the mean ﬁeld made by the nucleons themselves. In this case, the ﬁeld
of force at the position r will be given as
V (r) =
A

i=1
vN N(r −ri) =

vN N(r −r′)ρ(r′)dr′ ,
(5.1)
by adding the forces exerted on the nucleon at r from the other nucleons. vN N(r−r′)
is the nuclear potential working between two nucleons at r and r′, and ρ(r) is the
number density of nucleons at the position r. We used that ρ(r) is given by
ρ(r) =
A

i=1
δ(r −ri) ,

in transforming to the last term of Eq.(5.1).
If we assume
vN N(r) = −V0δ(r) (V0 > 0),
(5.3)
by emphasizing the short-range character of the nuclear force, we obtain
VN(r) = −V0ρ(r)
(5.4)
for the nuclear potential. Equation(5.4) suggests that the nuclear part of the mean
potential which nucleons feel inside the nucleus has the radial dependence similar
to that of the number density of nucleons inside the nucleus.
For this reason, the nuclear potential for nucleons inside a nucleus is often assumed
to be
VN(r) = −

1 + exp[(r −R)/a] ,

after Eq.(2.22), and is called the Woods–Saxon potential. Here, we assumed a spher-
ical nucleus.
The value of V0 can be estimated to be 40–50MeV from the facts that the Fermi
energy is 33–40MeV and the binding energy per nucleon is about 8MeV.
5.2.2
Energy Levels for the Inﬁnite Square-Well Potential
In the following, let us argue by ignoring the Coulomb force, although one has to add
the contribution of the Coulomb force for protons. One needs to perform numerical
calculations in order to determine the energy levels in the Woods–Saxon potential.
Let us therefore replace the potential by a square-well potential with an inﬁnitely
high wall at r = R in order to gain a qualitative understanding,
V (r) =

for n. nr is the number of nodes of the radial wave function at positions other than
the origin of the coordinate system, i.e., within the potential well.
The energy levels and the wave functions in the case of Cartesian coordinates can
be easily obtained by the series expansion method or by the method using the cre-
ation and annihilation operators as is explained in the standard textbook of quantum

One can easily guess which kinds of angular momentum states are included in
each energy level when the polar coordinates are used by considering the parity
and the degeneracy of each energy level, which can be easily determined in the
Cartesian coordinates, and the fact that the representations in terms of the Cartesian
coordinates and the polar coordinates can be transformed to each other using a unitary

The Magic Numbers in the Static Potential
Due to Short Range Force
The ﬁrst and second columns from the left in Fig.5.1 give the single-particle energy
levels together with the quantum numbers based on Eqs.(5.15) and (5.10), respec-
tively. The magic numbers appear when one energy level is fully occupied and the
energy gap to the next energy level is large. If we denote the number of states in the
2The parameter b which is deﬁned by b ≡1/α = √ℏ/MNω is also often used and is called the
oscillator parameter. It gives a measure of the strength of the potential which conﬁnes nucleons and
has the dimension of length. It gives the extension of the 0s-state and the measure of the size of
clusters such as the α-cluster.

Table5.2 shows that the magic numbers 2, 8 and 20 can be explained by the
harmonic oscillator model. Figure5.1 shows that the inﬁnite square-well potential
also explains the small magic numbers 2, 8 and 20. In addition, in the square-well
potential, the degeneracy concerning the angular momentum is resolved and the state
with larger angular momentum becomes energetically lower. This is because the
state with larger orbital angular momentum among the states with the same principal
quantum number has larger probability in the surface region, and hence more strongly
feels the difference, i.e., a negative perturbation, between the square-well potential
and the harmonic oscillator potential.
The third column in Fig.5.1 shows the energy levels for the Woods–Saxon poten-
tial. The structure of the energy levels in this case resembles that for the square-well
potential.
Exercise 5.2 Prove Eq.(5.26) by using that N (N) is given by N
ℓ=0,2,...(2ℓ+1)×2
when N is an even number and by N
ℓ=1,3,...(2ℓ+ 1) × 2 when N is an odd number
because of the degeneracies concerning the magnetic quantum number and the spin.
5.2.5
Spin–Orbit Interaction
Suppose that the spin–orbit interaction is acting on each nucleon in addition to
the static central force in order to explain the magic numbers larger than 20. The
Schrödinger equation to determine the energy levels of nucleons is then given by

−ℏ2
2MN
Δ + V (r) + vLS(ˆℓ· ˆs)

ψ(r) = E ψ(r) .
(5.27)
We assume here that vLS = ξLS (constant) for simplicity.
The modiﬁed energy levels for each N can be obtained by diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian with the degenerate states according to the perturbation theory for
degenerate case. Here, however, we use a more convenient method. Since the opera-
tor ˆℓ·ˆs does not commute with any components of the orbital angular momentum and
spin operator, their magnetic quantum numbers cannot be good quantum numbers
separately. On the other hand, since

ﬁrst excited state are the excitation energies in MeV. Also shown are the threshold energies for the
neutron and proton emissions. As seen in the ﬁgure, all the levels are above the threshold energy for
nucleon emission and are resonance states with large widths. The threshold energies for the neutron
and proton decays are after [2]

spin, the magnitude of the total angular momentum ˆj ≡ˆℓ+ ˆs and its z-component,

to derive Eq.(5.29).
We show in Fig.5.2 the ground and ﬁrst excited states of 5He and 5Li in order
to learn the strength and the sign of the spin–orbit interaction. The ﬁgure suggests
that the sign of ξLS is negative,3 hence the energy of the j = ℓ+ 1/2 state shifts
downward, while that of j = ℓ−1/2 state upward.4
3For electrons in atoms, the spin–orbit interaction is repulsive. Hence the energy of the j = ℓ−1/2
state gets lowered as shown in Fig.4.1.
4It is difﬁcult to determine the resonance parameters such as the level position for a resonance state
with a large width. In fact, [3] gives values which are very different from those in Fig.5.2 for the
energy splitting between the p1/2 and p3/2 states. For example, the excitation energy of the p1/2
state of 5He is 4.6MeV. Reference [1] also gives two different parameter sets depending on the
method of analysis. The resonance position and the width given in Fig.5.2 and mentioned also in
the following exercise have been obtained from the pole position of the S-matrix on the complex
energy plane (extended R-matrix method; after [4]). On the other hand, the conventional method,
i.e., standard R-matrix method, determines the parameters from the poles of the cross section by
restricting the energy to be real as experiments are performed. The former has the advantage that
the results do not depend on the choices of the boundary condition and the channel radius which
appear in the R-matrix theory. See [5, 6] for details of the R-matrix theory.

Exercise 5.3 Estimate the magnitude of ξLS for protons and neutrons from Fig.5.2.5
The width of the level is Γ = 648keV for the p3/2 state and Γ = 5.57MeV for the
p1/2 state for 5He, while Γ = 1.23MeV for p3/2 state and Γ = 6.60MeV for p1/2
state for 5Li [1]. Estimate the half-life and the mean life of the ground and excited
states of 5He and 5Li from these values.
The last column of Fig.5.1 gives the nucleon energy levels when the effect of the
spin–orbit interaction is added based on these considerations. Each energy level is
designated by the set of the radial quantum number n, the orbital angular momentum
ℓand the total angular momentum j. The ﬁgure shows that the magic numbers 28, 50,
82, 126 arise due to the spin–orbit interaction.6 Note that there are 2 j +1 degenerate
states with different magnetic quantum numbers in a single energy level with the
angular momentum j.
Note that the magic numbers 50, 82 and 126 are caused by the penetration of the
j = ℓ+ 1/2 levels with a large orbital angular momentum into the energy region
of the energy levels with the principal quantum number N smaller by one due to the
spin–orbit interaction and the surface effect, i.e., the effect that the realistic potential
is deeper in the surface region than that in the harmonic oscillator model. These states
are called intruder states. The 1g9/2, 1h11/2 and 1i13/2 levels play the principal role
as the intruder states for the magic numbers 50, 82 and 126, respectively.

expression of the Unitary transformation which represents the |ℓsj = ℓ+1/2 m j⟩
and |ℓsj = ℓ−1/2 m j⟩states in the |ℓsmℓms⟩basis. Also, write explicitly the
| f7/2 m = 7/2⟩and | f5/2 m = 5/2⟩in terms of Y3m, α, β.
Sidebar: Japanese Contribution to the Development of Shell model—Pioneers
of History: Tadayoshi Hikosaka and Takahiko Yamanouchi The independent
particle model, i.e., the shell model, thus succeeds in explaining the existence and
the actual numbers of magic numbers through the shell layer structure of the energy
levels of nucleons, and the Pauli exclusion principle. Historically, pioneering studies
of the independent particle model (shell model) had been developed in Japan too by
Tadayoshi Hikosaka, Tohoku University, and Takahiko Yamanouchi, University of
Tokyo. However, their pioneering works had been forgotten before their theory is
accepted as the correct effective model for many nuclear properties.
5It is necessary to handle both the ground and excited states as resonance states in order to achieve
a quantitatively accurate estimate. Here, however, use the harmonic oscillator model and ignore the
radial dependence of the spin–orbit force in order to obtain a rough estimate of ξLS.
6The tensor force also strongly affects the magic numbers and the shape of nucleus, and is one of
the active research subjects in recent years in connection with, e.g., the structure of unstable nuclei
such as the change of the magic number. For example, 40Ca is spherical, but 32Mg is deformed
among the N = 20 isotones (see [7]).

5.2 Explanation of the Magic Numbers by Mean-Field Theory

There remain historical episodes that both Hikosaka and Yamanouchi received
strong objections when they discussed with Niels Bohr based on the success of
the liquid-drop model to explain ﬁssion and the compound nucleus reactions. On
the contrary, the existence of magic numbers was a strong experimental evidence in
the cases of Mayer and Jensen who established the shell model later. There remains
also an episode that Jensen got the inspiration of the spin–orbit interaction while he
was attending a dance party. Incidentally, Hikosaka is the same person as who has
proposed the heterogeneous reactor.

The Spin and Parity of the Ground and Low-Lying
States of Doubly-Magic ±1 Nuclei
The nucleus in which both proton and neutron numbers are magic numbers such as
16
8 O8 and 208
82 Pb126 is called doubly-magic nucleus or doubly-closed shell nucleus.
One can predict the spin and parity of the ground state of the nuclei whose proton
or neutron number is smaller or larger than those of a doubly-magic nucleus by one
by using the shell model. The spin and parity of low-lying states of those nuclei can
also be predicted to some extent.
Consider 209
82 Pb for example. For the ground state, the single-particle energy levels
are successively ﬁlled with nucleons from the lowest energy level according to the
Pauli exclusion principle. Figure5.1 suggests that all the 82 protons are just ﬁlled in
the states from the nℓj = 1s1/2 level to the 3s1/2 level. The 126 neutrons occupy all
the states from the 1s1/2 to the 2 f5/2 levels. Let us call this part, which corresponds
to doubly-magic numbers, the core part. One then ﬁlls the last 127th neutron, called
the valence neutron, in the next energy level 2g9/2. Since there is only one way to ﬁll
all the 2 j + 1 degenerate states for a given nℓj with the same number of particles,
Jtot =0 because of 2Jtot + 1 = 1 if we denote the total spin of these 2 j + 1 nucleons
by Jtot. Also, the total parity of these nucleons is plus irrespective of the even–odd
property of the orbital angular momentum ℓ, since 2 j + 1 is always an even number.
Consequently, the total spin and parity of the nucleons forming the core are 0+. As

118

Shell Structure
Fig. 5.3 The ground and
low-lying excited states of
209Pb and 209Bi (the energies
are in MeV) [3]
the result, the spin and parity of the whole nucleus is determined by those of the
valence neutron. Hence the spin and parity of the ground state of 209
82 Pb are expected
to be 9/2+.
The left side of Fig.5.3 shows the experimental energy-level diagram for 209
82 Pb
(Data from [3]). The spin and parity of the ground state agree with the prediction of
the shell model described above. One can keep the core part as it is and change the
level to ﬁll the valence neutron from the 2g9/2 state to another state successively from
the low energy level in order to predict the spin and parity of the other states. As an
alternative, one can consider the state, where the core is polarized and the nucleon
in the energy level nhℓhjh in the core, where the index h stands for hole, is promoted
to the n pℓpjp level outside the core, where the index p stands for particle. If the
original valence nucleon is in the nℓj state, the corresponding wave function can be
written, for example, as

(nhℓhjh)−1 ⊗[(n pℓpjp) ⊗(nℓj)][J ′][ j′]; j′m′⟩.7 The state
of this kind of conﬁguration is called two-particle one-hole (2p1h) state. Although
there are many possibilities depending on the way to make a hole, the choice of the
particle state to promote the original core nucleon, and the way to couple the angular
momenta, the state, where the core neutron is promoted to the same level as that of
the valence neutron and where the total angular momentum of two valence neutrons
7We used the convention to omit the core part in writing the conﬁguration, and to make the core
part as the reference conﬁguration.

5.3 The Spin and Parity of the Ground and Low-Lying States …
119
J ′ couples to zero, appears at low energy because of the pairing interaction between
the valence nucleons. In this case, the spin and parity of the whole nucleus become
identical with those of the hole state, i.e., jh and (−1)ℓh.
An interesting another possibility is that a series of characteristic states appear in
low energy region by the process that the core part makes a low energy collective
excitation and weakly couples with the valence nucleon. An example can be seen in
209Bi shown on the right side of Fig.5.3 [3]. The ground state and the ﬁrst through
third excited states can be understood as the single-particle states or 2p1h state in the
shell model. The septet states above them, 3/2+, 5/2+, 7/2+, 9/2+, 11/2+, 13/2+,
and 15/2+, are the states, where the core of 209Bi makes a vibrational excitation of
the octupole type (see Chap.7) and weakly couples with the valence proton in the
h9/2 orbit, and can be expressed as |[3−⊗h9/2]J; J +⟩[9] (see also [10]).
Exercise 5.6
1. Predict the conﬁgurations for the low-lying excited states of 209
82 Pb.
2. Predict the conﬁgurations as well as the spin and parity of the ground state and
low-lying excited states of 17O, 15O and 209
83 Bi, and compare the predicted spin
and parity with those in the experimental data in [3].
Incidentally, in the case of odd–odd nuclei in which both proton and neutron
numbers are odd numbers, the parity and the spin of the ground state and low-lying
excited states are expected to be given by (−1)ℓp+ℓn and one of the values between
| jp −jn| and jp + jn, where ℓp, jp, ℓn. jn are the orbital and total angular momenta of
the orbits of the last proton and neutron. For example, in the case of 14
7 N, ℓp = ℓn = 1,
jp = jn = 1/2 and the experimental data for the spin and parity of the ground state
are 1+.
5.4
The Magnetic Dipole Moment in the Ground State
of Odd Nuclei: Single Particle Model
The idea which attributes the properties of not only the doubly-magic ±1 nuclei,
but all nuclei with an odd mass number, i.e., the even–odd or odd–even nuclei, or
simply the odd nuclei, in general entirely to the last proton or neutron whose total
number is an odd number is called the single particle model. The single particle
model often well predicts the spin and parity of the ground state and some states in
the vicinity of the ground state of odd nuclei. This happens because nucleons move
around pairwise by forming a pair of total angular momentum and parity 0+ due
to the pairing interaction (see Sect.5.8), and consequently the total spin and parity
of the nucleus is determined by the last unpaired nucleon or hole regardless of the
actual number of valence nucleons outside the core or the number of holes inside the
core.
Exercise 5.7 Predict the conﬁgurations and the spin and parity of the ground and
some low-lying excited states of 45
21Sc and compare the predicted spin and parity with
the experimental data [3].

120

Shell Structure
Here, let us learn that the single particle model provides a rough estimate of
the magnetic dipole moment of odd nuclei, and further study how the discrepancy
between the experimental data and the prediction of the single particle model is
explained by the concept of core polarization or the conﬁguration mixing.
5.4.1
The Schmidt Lines
The magnetic moment is deﬁned by μ ≡⟨j j| ˆμz| j j⟩in the single particle model
following Eq.(4.39), where the operator of the magnetic moment ˆμ is given by
ˆμ = μN(gsˆs + gℓˆℓ) ,
(5.31)
according to Eqs.(4.15)–(4.17).
Here let us derive the explicit expression of μ by using the projection theorem for
the expectation value of vector operator (see Appendix A.6.4). From Eq. (A.106),
μ =
1
j( j + 1)⟨j j| ˆjZ| j j⟩⟨j j|( ˆμ · ˆj)| j j⟩
(5.32)
=
1
j + 1⟨j j|( ˆμ · ˆj)| j j⟩.
(5.33)
The expectation values of the operators ˆs · ˆj and ˆℓ· ˆj, which are needed to evaluate
⟨j j|( ˆμ · ˆj)| j j⟩, can be easily obtained in the same way as that was used to obtain the
expectation value of the operator ˆℓ· ˆs in Sect.5.2.5. Finally, μ is given by
μ =

Thus one can expect that the magnetic moments are given by the solid lines in
Fig.5.4dependingonwhether j = ℓ−1/2 or j = ℓ+1/2 byremarkingthat gℓ= 1.0,
gs = gp ≈5.58 in the case of odd-Z nuclei and gℓ= 0.0, gs = gn ≈−3.82 in
the case of odd-N nuclei. These lines are referred to as the Schmidt lines. The
experimental values lie between the two Schmidt lines except for a small number of
nuclei such as 3H, 3He, 13C and 189

Conﬁguration Mixing and Core Polarization
Figure5.4 shows the success of the shell model in the sense that it well explains the
gross behaviour of the magnetic moment, while it also shows the limitation of the
single particle model in reproducing the magnitude. A large part of the deviation of
the experimental values from the corresponding Schmidt values can be explained
by considering the conﬁguration mixing due to the residual interaction which is not
incorporated in the mean ﬁeld [12]. Let us denote the residual interaction by V , and
write the wave function which takes into account the effect of the residual interaction
as

state given by Eq.(5.36). In Eq.(5.37), we used an abbreviated notation |Ci⟩for the
additional terms due to the conﬁguration mixing.
The effect of conﬁguration mixing is often called the effect of core polarization. In
fact, for the nuclei in the vicinity of doubly-magic nuclei, the correction terms mixed
by the conﬁguration mixing or a part of them are caused by a process where the core
part is excited, i.e., polarized. However, it will be more appropriate to understand
that the effect of conﬁguration mixing is a wider concept than that of simple-minded
core polarization. In Eq.(5.36), we used the indices p and h suggesting the particle
or hole states as indices of quantum numbers in order to facilitate imagining the
physical process.
The magnetic moment is given by

when there exists conﬁguration mixing, or core polarization. If we assume, n =
20, αi = 0.1(i = 1 −20) and α2
0 = 0.80, i.e., α0 = 0.89, then α0
20
i=1 αi = 1.78.
Hence a large correction can arise if there are many different ways to polarize the
core and if they contribute cooperatively even if the mixing amplitude of each core
polarization is small. In fact, Arima and Horie have succeeded in reproducing the
experimental values of the magnetic moment by taking into account the effect of
core polarization [12].
Various types of conﬁguration mixing can be considered depending on the residual
interaction. For example, if V = (σ 1 · σ 2)Vσ(r) or V = (σ 1 · σ 2)(τ 1 · τ 2)Vστ(r),
then J in Eq.(5.36) becomes 1, and one can expect that the effect of core polarization
becomes large for the nuclei in which the j = ℓ+ 1/2 level among the group of
levels split by the spin–orbit interaction from a degenerate energy level in the static
mean ﬁeld is occupied and the counter j = ℓ−1/2 level is empty.
So far, we used the values of free nucleons for the g-factor of nucleons. As
mentioned in Sect.4.1.2, those values can change inside nuclei e.g., by a quenching
effect. More generally, the effects of meson and the excited state of nucleon Δ33
also contribute to the deviation from the Schmidt values. Especially, the magnetic
moments of 3H and 3He, which lie outside the Schmidt lines, are explained by the
meson effect. It is suggested from the detailed studies on the interaction between
pions and nucleons and from the electromagnetic form factors of these particles that
the anomalous magnetic moment of nucleons is weakened inside the nucleus by
about 10%. In this connection, we wish to mention that the study of the I π = 11−
isomer state of 210Po shows that the gℓ-factor of proton is larger by about 10% as an
example of the meson effect [13].

[Addendum] The Anomalous Magnetic Moments
of Nucleons in the Quark Model
In Chap.1, we attributed the anomalous magnetic moments of nucleons to the effects
of meson cloud. Alternatively, here we show that the anomalous magnetic moments
of nucleons can be naturally derived from the point of view of the quark model.
In the quark model, proton is made up of two u quarks and one d quark. It is
considered that all the baryons existing in nature are in the color-singlet state, which
is antisymmetric concerning the color degree of freedom, and are spatially symmetric
in low-energy states. Hence the wave function for proton in the combined spaces of
the spin and ﬂavor degrees of freedom must be symmetric in total, and is given by
[14]
|p ↑⟩=

(5.39)
Similarly, the wave function for |n ↑⟩state is given by interchanging u and d quarks.
On the other hand, the operator of the magnetic moment of the ith quark is given
by

(5.42)
Similarly, we obtain
μn = 1

Mass Number Dependence of the Level Spacing ℏω
The spacing between two successive energy levels, i.e., ℏω in the harmonic oscillator
model, plays the central role in the shell model. Here, we estimate the value of ℏω.

The Magnitude and Origin of Spin–Orbit Interaction
It will be worth commenting on the magnitude and origin of the spin–orbit interaction
[15]. For nuclei with large mass numbers, the spin–orbit interaction is suggested to
be
VLS ∼−20ˆℓ· ˆsA−2/3 MeV
(5.53)
from the experimental data for the energy difference between the j = ℓ+ 1/2
and j = ℓ−1/2 states split by the spin–orbit interaction. Since ℓ∼kF R =
(9π/8)1/3 A1/3 for nucleons in the vicinity of the Fermi surface, VLS becomes non-
negligible compared with ℏω given by Eq.(5.52), and plays an important role in
determining magic numbers.
Thespin–orbitinteractionusedinEq.(5.27)istheone-bodyspin–orbitinteraction.
It originates partly from the two-body spin–orbit interaction, which we studied in
Sect.3.2.2, by averaging over the coordinates of one of the nucleons. The tensor
force is another source of the one-body spin–orbit interaction. In the relativistic
mean-ﬁeld theory which we learn in Sect.6.3, the spin–orbit interaction originates
from the coupling of nucleons to the σ-, ρ-, ω-mesons, and depends on the isospin
of nucleons due to the contribution of the ρ-meson.
5.7
Difference Between the Potentials for Protons
and for Neutrons: Lane Potential
The potential given by Eq.(5.1) corresponds to the Hartree potential which we learn
in Sect.6.1. More precisely, the strength of the potential V0 depends on the isospin
of nucleons reﬂecting, e.g., the exchange effects, and is replaced by
V = V0 −1

V1 ,
(5.54)
if we take the deﬁnition that ˆtz|n⟩= 1
2|n⟩, and ˆtz|p⟩= −1
2|p⟩. Hence the potential for
nucleons depends on the isospin of nucleons. The isospin dependent term is called
the Lane potential. One can estimate the strength of V1 as

The Lane potential can be derived in the following way. Suppose that the interac-
tion between two nucleons is given by

potential. Let us consider two cases in order to estimate the magnitude. One of
the cases is the Serber exchange potential, where m = w = 1/2. In this case,
w −m/4 = 3/8, m/(w −m/4) = 4/3. The other case is the Volkov force, which
is often used for the study of cluster structure of light nuclei. In this case, m = 0.6,
w = 1 −m = 0.4. Hence w −m/4 = 0.25, m/(w −m/4) = 2.4. Since V0 and V1
in Eq.(5.54) are about 40 and 100MeV, respectively, the Volkov force well agrees
with the phenomenological strength of the Lane potential.
Physically, the Lane potential can be considered to reﬂect the fact that the force
between proton and neutron is stronger than the forces between protons and between
neutrons. Since the difference is intimately related to the effect of the tensor force,
one can suppose that the Volkov interaction is a force which effectively incorporates
the effect of the tensor force.

5.8.1
The Spin and Parity of the Ground and Low Excited
States of 210
82 Pb
The spin and parity of the ground and low excited states of magic number ±2 nuclei
provide a good example of showing the important role of the pairing correlation in
nuclei.
Consider 210
82 Pb as an example. Figure5.1 suggests that the conﬁguration for low-
lying states including the ground state is (2g9/2)2
n . The power 2 means to ﬁll two
nucleons.8 Hence, from the law of addition of angular momentum, we expect that
there appear 0+, 1+, . . . , 7+, and 8+ states in low-energy region.
Figure5.6 shows the energy-level diagrams for 210
82 Pb128 and 210
84 Po126 in low-
energy region [3]. There appear indeed the 0+, 2+, 4+, 6+, 8+ states in low-energy
region in the ﬁgure for 210
82 Pb as expected.
One can prove that the odd-spin states do not appear because of the Pauli exclusion
principle as follows. Let us use the total spin j to represent the quantum number of
the single-particle level. The state in which two neutrons or two protons ﬁll the jα
and jβ states is then given by
|( jα jβ)J M⟩a = N

|( jα jβ)J M⟩−P12|( jα jβ)J M⟩

(5.60)
by making antisymmetrization in order to satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. N is
the normalization constant. The lower index a denotes antisymmetrization and P12
is the operator to interchange the particles 1 and 2. We used that the wave function
in the isospin space is symmetric concerning the exchange of two nucleons, since
we are considering the case where the two nucleons are the same kind of nucleons.
One can rewrite the second term of Eq.(5.60) as
P12|( jα jβ)J M⟩= P12

(5.61)
We used the following property of the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcient,
8We used the lower index n in order to indicate that it is the energy level for neutrons.

Equation(5.63) shows that only even numbers are allowed for the total spin J when
one ﬁlls two identical nucleons in the same jα = jβ = j orbit, because 2 j is an odd
number.

The Effect of δ-Type Residual Interaction: Pairing
Correlation
The shell model which assumes that nucleons move independently from each other
in a mean ﬁeld under the constraint of Pauli exclusion principle well explains the
basic features of nuclei such as the magic numbers. However, it has to be reﬁned by
taking into account the effects of residual interaction in order to explain the details
appearing in the experimental data.

by introducing a mean ﬁeld U(x). V is the residual interaction if we consider the
ˆh(0) ≡−ℏ2∇2/2MN +U as the unperturbed single-particle Hamiltonian of the shell
model which uses, e.g., the harmonic oscillator potential for U.
We learnt in Sect.5.4.2 that the residual interaction plays an important role in the
magnetic moment. The degenerate 0+, 2+, . . . , 8+ levels in 210
82 Pb are also resolved
by the residual interaction.
Let us assume that the residual interaction between two nucleons is given by
V (r1 −r2) = −V0δ(r1 −r2) .
(5.66)
Using the perturbation theory, one can then show (see Appendix A.11) that the
energy of two-nucleon system, where each of the single-particle levels (nαℓα jα) and
(nβℓβ jβ) is occupied by one nucleon and their angular momenta couple to the total
angular momentum J, changes by the amount of

where unℓ(r) is the radial wave function deﬁned according to Eq.(5.22). Equa-
tions(5.67)–(5.69) show that the energy shift by the residual interaction depends
on the total spin J only through the factor A via the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcient and
2J + 1. Table5.3 shows the factor A as a function of J for the case when we ﬁll
two identical nucleons in the same jα = jβ = 9/2 orbit. The table suggests that
the energy split among the 0+, 2+, . . . , 8+ states shown in Fig.5.6 has been induced
by the short-range residual interaction of δ-function type. The J = 0 state appears
as the lowest energy level, because in that state two nucleons move in the same
orbit with opposite directions, so that the spatial overlap is large. Consequently, the
correlation energy of attractive δ-function type is maximized. The spatial overlap of
two nucleons gets smaller with increasing J. Accordingly the energy shift from the
energy in the independent particle model becomes smaller. Note that the energy shift

In this way, in the ground state of nuclei, two identical nucleons occupy two orbits,
which are time-reversed orbits to each other, as a pair of the total angular momentum
J = 0. This is called the pairing correlation in nuclei and corresponds to the Cooper
pair and superﬂuidity in condensed matter physics.9
5.9
Column: Superheavy Elements (SHE)
As stated in Sect.2.3.4 concerning the stability with respect to ﬁssion, the liquid-drop model
suggeststhattheﬁssionbarrierdisappearswhentheatomicnumberexceedsabout100,because
the Coulomb force which prefers to ﬁssion then overcomes the surface tension which resists
ﬁssion.Henceitpredictsthatthereexistnoheavynucleibeyond Z ∼100.However,theoretical
calculations predict that there appear ﬁssion barriers due to shell effect and that the atomic
number Z = 114 and the neutron number N = 18410 are the magic numbers next to the
known magic numbers Z = 82 and N = 126 and that there exists a region of relatively stable
nuclei around the set of these numbers in the nuclear chart. They are called superheavy nuclei
and the corresponding elements are called superheavy elements (SHE). Extensive activities
to examine such theoretical prediction and to explore the limit of existence of nuclei in the
region of large mass number are continued.
Figures5.7 and 5.8 show reports of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in
Dubna, Russia and the RIKEN at Wako, Japan, which are currently the world centers of
experimental activities in this subject. In Fig.5.7, the superheavy nuclei synthesized by the
so-called hot fusion which uses actinides such as Cf and Cm as the target and 48Ca as the
projectile are shown by circles and the superheavy nuclei synthesized by the cold fusion which
9One can rigorously discuss the level structure in the presence of the pairing correlation in an
algebraic way by using the quasi-spin formalism if one simpliﬁes that only the pair whose total
angular momentum J is zero is affected by the attractive residual interaction [17].
10These numbers vary somewhat depending on the theoretical models.

Fig. 5.7 Superheavy elements and the shell correction energy (in MeV), taken from [18]
bombards Pb or Bi target with, e.g., Ni by crosses.11 The numbers attached to the contour
lines are the magnitudes of the shell correction energy.
As the names cold fusion and hot fusion suggest, superheavy elements are synthesized by
making two heavy nuclei with atomic numbers Z1 and Z2 collide to fuse to form a nucleus with
a larger atomic number Z1 + Z2. A feature of heavy-ion fusion reactions used to synthesize
superheavy elements with large atomic number is that the ﬁssion barrier locates inside the
fusion barrier for the entrance channel. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that a compound nucleus
with a certain lifetime is formed even if the colliding nuclei succeed to approach inside
the fusion barrier for the entrance channel. Thus the formation cross section of superheavy
elements gets very small.
Together with the experimental studies, many theoretical studies have been undertaken to
elucidate the reaction mechanism and to suggest suitable combinations of the projectile and
target nuclei as well as experimental conditions for the synthesis of superheavy nuclei using
transport theories such as the stochastic differential equations and various other methods [19].
Superheavy elements have short lifetimes, and the cross section to synthesize them is
so small as a few events in the experiments of a few months. Hence it is a hard task to
experimentally conﬁrm that the superheavy nuclei have been synthesized. The elements whose
atomic numbers are 107–112 have been synthesized at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy
Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, by the cold fusion reactions using Bi and Pb as the
target nuclei. The electromagnetic separator called SHIP (Separator for Heavy Ion reaction
Products)was usedina series ofexperiments, andthe identiﬁcationofthe nuclearspecies ofthe
synthesized superheavy nuclei has been done by conﬁrming that the synthesized superheavy
nuclei reach to a known nucleus after repeating α decays. As Fig.5.8 shows, the experiments
at RIKEN in 2004 and 2005 also used the fact that the α-decay chains from the superheavy
nucleus have been observed and that the lifetime of the daughter nucleus 262
105Db which caused
ﬁssion at the last stage does not contradict the known lifetime of the spontaneous ﬁssion
as the evidence of the synthesis of element 113. The synthesis of the isotope 278113 of the
element 113 was conﬁrmed by the experiment in August, 2012, where six successive α-chains
11The reactions which have a large reaction Q-value and hence synthesize a superheavy nucleus
as the evaporation residue after emitting about three neutrons by the evaporation process are called
hot fusion, while the reactions which have a small Q-value and emit one neutron in synthesizing
a superheavy nucleus is called cold fusion. Since the average binding energy of nucleon is about
8MeV, one neutron is emitted for each 8MeV of the excitation energy.

209Bi+ 70Zn→278113+n reactions [20]
leading to 254
101Md were observed [20]. Of the observed six α-decays the last two, i.e., the
α-decays of Db and Lr, agreed with the known α-decays. Thus, the synthesis of the element
113 became unquestionable. The right to name the element Z = 113 was then given to
Morita et al. at RIKEN by IUPAP/IUPAC in December, 2015. The name was announced
as Nh (Nihonium) on June 8, 2016. By comparison, for the experiments at JINR using the
hot fusion it has been an obstacle to conﬁrmation of the synthesis of superheavy nuclei that
the decay chains from the synthesized nuclei do not connect to the known region. However,
those elements have been ﬁnally recognized by IUPAP/IUPAC, since the synthesis of the
112th element (283Cn) by hot fusion has been reproduced at GSI, and in addition the number
of events of the synthesis of 114th and 116th elements has been increased by the double-
check experiments by the collaboration between JINR and Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, USA and it was accepted that their decay can be reasonably interpreted as the
decay through 283Cn. The Z = 114 and Z = 116 elements have been named Fl (Flerovium)
and Lv (Livermorium), respectively, in May, 2012. Furthermore, the Z = 115, 117 and 118
elements, which were synthesized by hot fusion, were announced as Mc (Moscovium), Ts
(Tennessine), Og (Oganesson), respectively, on June 8, 2016.

Chapter 6
Microscopic Mean-Field Theory
(Hartree–Fock Theory)
Abstract In the last chapter we discussed the shell structure of nuclei by assuming
a simpliﬁed mean ﬁeld such as the Wood–Saxon potential or the harmonic oscillator
potential, which appears realistic. However, properly speaking, it is necessary to self-
consistently determine the mean ﬁeld and the whole nucleus as well as the individual
states of nucleons inside the nucleus, because the mean ﬁeld itself is determined
based on the interaction between constituent nucleons. In this chapter we describe
the basic ingredients of the Hartree–Fock theory, which is a representative of such
self-consistent approaches, and of some related microscopic theories. It will not
be an overstatement to say that the self-consistent calculations from microscopic
points of view are at the center of current theoretical studies of nuclear structure.
An important aspect in performing microscopic calculations such as the Hartree–
Fock calculations is that the force between the constituent particles, i.e., the nuclear
force, is not necessarily well established or involves some features which make the
theoretical treatment difﬁcult in contract to the systems which are objects of, e.g.,
condensed matter physics, where the interaction between the constituent particles
is the well-known Coulomb interaction. The studies based on microscopic theories
utilizes interdependence of theory and experiments. One analyzes experimental data
with theories using the new nuclear force which looks more realistic. One then
improves the nuclear force so as to incorporate the results of the analysis, then
reconﬁrms thus obtained new theoretical predictions with experimental data.

We assumed a central potential of the Wigner-type for the nucleon–nucleon interac-
tion v. Equation (6.3) is called the Hartree–Fock equation, and ΓH and ΓEX are the
Hartree and Fock or exchange potentials, respectively. Note that the Hartree potential
matches the potential assumed in Eq. (5.1) and that the Fock potential is non-local
if the range of the nuclear force is ﬁnite.
Equation (6.3) which determines single-particle wave functions and the corre-
sponding single-particle energies has to be solved self-consistently, since the Hartree
and Fock potentials depend on the density of the nucleus at each position. The his-
torically standard method for that aim is to expand the single-particle wave functions
{ψ} in terms of the wave functions of the harmonic oscillator model which we learnt
in the previous section and determine the expansion coefﬁcients by the iteration
method. Recently, however, it is getting popular also to use an alternative method
which directly solves the Hartree–Fock equation by numerical integration without
introducing the expansion basis by dividing the whole space into small meshes. Since
the accuracy of the expansion method depends on the size of the expansion basis, the
direct integration method is useful, especially for the currently active area of study
of unstable nuclei where the binding energy of valence nucleons is small.
6.1.1
Equivalent Local Potential, Effective Mass
As we learnt in the previous chapter, the shell model usually assumes a local mean
ﬁeld. One can convert the integro-differential equation due to non-local potential
into an equivalent local equation if certain conditions are fulﬁlled. One can then

6.1 Hartree–Fock Equation

understand the characteristic effects caused by the non-local potential in different
physical terms.
We show in Appendix A.5 that the effect of non-locality can be represented by
the energy or momentum dependence of the effective local potential if the change
of the potential within a wave length is small and hence if the wave function can
be well approximated in the WKB approximation, i.e., by an extension of the plane
wave using the local wave number. Furthermore, if the non-locality is moderate, the
non-local effect can be represented in terms of a position-dependent effective mass.
6.1.2
Nuclear Matter and Local Density Approximation
6.1.2.1
Local Density Approximation
As Eq. (6.5) shows, the Fock potential depends on the non-diagonal matrix elements
of the density operator. Its primary effect can be understood by considering the
nucleus locally as a nuclear matter1 and by approximating the wave functions of
nucleonswiththeplanewavesdistributeduptotheFermisurfacecorrespondingtothe
density ρ((r + r′)/2) at each position. This is called the local density approximation.
Following this idea, ρ(r, r′) is given by

when the density is uniform. The last factor 1/2 in the second term is the factor
which takes into account the orthogonality in the spin space when two protons are

called nuclear matter.

6.1.2.2
Effective Mass in the Local Density Approximation
Let us study how the effective mass depends on the parameters of the nuclear force
and the nuclear density by using the local density approximation.2
We begin by noting that the potential energy U in the Hartree–Fock approximation
is given in general by
U = 1
2

α,β=occupied
⟨αβ|v|αβ⟩a ,
(6.11)
where α and β denote the total quantum numbers in the usual, the spin and the isospin
spaces, and the ket state |αβ⟩a represents the antisymmetrized state (|αβ⟩−|βα⟩).
The sum is carried over all states below the Fermi surface. We assume that the nuclear
force is the central force of the Yukawa type given by Eq. (3.62),
v(r) = V0
e−μr
μr (w + mPM) = v0(r)(1 −m + mPM) .
(6.12)
Ifweexpress v as Eq. (3.29)byintroducingtheprojectionoperators,thenthepotential
in each projected state is given by
Vtt(r) = Vss(r) = V0(1 −2m)e−μr
μr
,
Vst(r) = Vts(r) = V0
e−μr
μr
.
(6.13)
Let us consider especially the inﬁnite nuclear matter consisting of equal numbers
of protons and neutrons, where both spin-up and down states are occupied. In that
case, the total potential energy can be expressed as

The following expressions can be obtained for the local and non-local terms in
Eq. (6.3) by performing the functional differentiation of U with respect to ψ∗
k (r).
ΓH(r) = (4 −5m)

v0(|r −r′|)ρ′(r′)dr′ ,

We divided each term by 4 by specifying spin and isospin in taking the functional
differentiation.
Let us now calculate the Fock term in the Hartree–Fock equation by using the
explicit form of the nuclear force v0(r −r′) = V0e−μ|r−r′|/μ|r −r′| and the result
of Eq. (6.8). In that procedure, we use the plane wave for the wave function accord-
ing to the nuclear matter approximation. The Fock term can then be expressed as

Equation (6.21) shows that the contribution of the Fock term to the effective mass
is zero, i.e., M∗= MN, in the limit when the range of the nuclear force is zero, i.e.,
when μ →∞, and gets larger with increasing range. The same equation as Eq. (6.21)

can be obtained also from the evaluation of the energy of nucleons with momentum
ℏk. If we take kF = 1.27 fm−1, ρ = 0.138 fm−3 (Table2.2), m = 0.5 (Serber force),
V0 = −48.1MeV, a = 1/μ = 1.17fm (see Eq. (3.64)), then M∗
N = 0.76MN. This
well agrees with the results of the standard Hartree–Fock calculations such as the
Skyrme Hartree–Fock calculations, which we learn in the next section.

6.1.3
Saturation Property in the Well-Behaved Potential,
Constraint to the Exchange Property
A characteristic of the potential given by Eq. (6.12) in comparison with potentials
with repulsive core which have been introduced in Chap.3 is that one can perform
Hartree–Fock calculations as it is, since the matrix elements of the nuclear force
do not diverge.3 We comment here on how the saturation property, i.e., the fact
that nuclei do not collapse or that nuclei exist with a ﬁnite density, is guaranteed
within the framework of the Hartree–Fock theory for such a well-behaved potential.
Similarly to Sect.6.1.2.2 we consider the inﬁnite nuclear matter consisting of the
same numbers of neutrons and protons, where both spin-up and down states are
occupied, and assume that the radial dependence of the nuclear force is given by
v0(r) = V0e−μr/μr similarly to Eq. (6.12). Then, the condition
16 −20m < 0,
i.e., m > 4
5 ,
(6.23)
has to be satisﬁed in order for nuclei to exist with a ﬁnite density as we can see from
Eq. (6.22).
The condition given by Eq. (6.23) contradicts the requirement of two-nucleon
scattering, which suggests m ∼1/2 (for example, Serber force). In this way, it is dif-
ﬁcult to satisfy the requirement of the saturation property with well-behaved poten-
tials such as that given by Eq. (6.12) solely by the exchange property of the nuclear
force. Hence it is necessary to attribute the saturation property to some effective
3Such potentials are often called well-behaved potentials.

many-body interaction, which takes into account the medium effects. The Skyrme
interaction, which we describe in the following, is one example of such interactions.4
6.2
Skyrme Hartree–Fock Calculations for Finite Nuclei
6.2.1
Skyrme Force
It is not so easy to systematically study nuclear structure from the point of view
of a quantum many-body problem based on the Brueckner theory (see Sect.3.8).
On the other hand, the Hartree–Fock calculations using a phenomenological nuclear
force began in early 1970s and have been very popular up to now. Especially, the
Hartree–Fock calculations using the simple force invented by Skyrme are known
under the name of the Skyrme Hartree–Fock calculations [3] and have become a
standard calculation for nuclear structure.
Skyrme invented the extreme nuclear force of δ-function type to emphasize the
short-range property of the nuclear force. In addition, he introduced a three-body
force to guarantee the saturation property,
V =

i< j
V (i, j) +

i< j<k
V (i, j, k) .
(6.24)
(A) Two-Body Force The force currently used as the Skyrme force, which is an
extension of the force introduced originally by Skyrme himself, reads
V (1, 2) = t0(1 + x0Pσ)δ(r1 −r2)

2t1(1 + x1Pσ)

+ iW0(σ 1 + σ 2) · kL × δ(r1 −r2)kR ,
(6.25)
where Pσ is the spin exchange operator deﬁned by Eq. (3.18), and kR and kL are
deﬁned by
kR ≡1
2i(∇1 −∇2) ,
(6.26)
kL ≡−1
2i(∇1 −∇2) ,
(6.27)
and operate on the right and the left, respectively.
4The study of equation of state using the simple perfect rigid sphere model shows that the saturation
property is guaranteed by the repulsive core in the high density region higher than about six times
the standard density ρ0 ∼0.14 fm−3 if one assumes the radius of the repulsive core to be 0.4fm.

142

Microscopic Mean-Field Theory (Hartree–Fock Theory)
(B) Three-body force The three-body force5 which was originally introduced by
Skyrme reads
V (1, 2, 3) = t3δ(r1 −r2)δ(r2 −r3) .
(6.28)
However, currently, it is more popular to introduce an additional two-body term

instead of the term of the three-body force 
i< j<k V (i, j, k). This model is designed
toguaranteethesaturationandcontrolthenuclearincompressibilitythroughthevalue
of α, which is often assumed to be either 1/3 or 1/6. The latter gives, of course, a
smaller incompressibility.
The W0 term in Eq. (6.25) represents the two-body spin–orbit interaction. The t0
term corresponds to the limit of zero-range nuclear force, and is the attractive term
which is indispensable for the nucleus to exist as a self-bound system. The t1 and
t2 terms have been introduced to take into account the effects of the ﬁnite range
property of the nuclear force. In order to understand this, let us consider a two-body
central force with a ﬁnite range,6,7
v(r) = V0e−(r/a)2 .
(6.30)
In this case, the matrix elements using the eigenstates of the momentum operator are
given by

Equation (6.31) can be derived by inserting the completeness relation

on both sides of the operator ˆv and using ⟨r|k⟩=
1
√
Ω eik·r and also that the matrix
element of a local potential ˆv in the Dirac notation is given by
5This term is an effective interaction, which represents the many-body effects and the effect of
repulsive core appearing in the G-matrix theory and has been introduced to avoid the collapse of
nuclei, and should be distinguished from the genuine three-body force appearing in the discussion
of nuclear force based on the meson theory as the force involving three nucleons [1]. The magnitude
of the latter has been discussed through detailed calculations of the binding energy and the form
factor of light nuclei such as the triton and 3He using, e.g., the Faddeev equation.
6Instead of the Yukawa type, we assumed the Gauss type as a two-body central force to facilitate
calculations.
7Here, we eliminate the center-of-mass motion and formulate only for the relative motion, and treat
it as a one-body problem.

second order with respect to a in Eq. (6.32), and transform back to the coordinate

By comparing Eq. (6.25) with Eq. (6.36), one can expect that t0 < 0, t1 > 0, and

one of the representations of the δ-function, δ(x) = lima→0 e−(x/a)2/√πa .

Skyrme Hartree–Fock Equation
In the Skyrme Hartree–Fock calculations, thanks to the feature of the interaction that
it is of the δ-function type one can explicitly write down the Hartree–Fock equation
in terms of the parameters of the nuclear force and the nucleon density ρ [3]. We give

the result of Eq. (6.21), the effective mass stays the same as the bare nucleon mass
in the limit of zero-range force, i.e., in the limit of t1 = 0, t2 = 0, and gets smaller
with increasing range of the nuclear force.

the Skyrme force are determined so as to satisfy these conditions and to reproduce
the radii and the binding energies of some of the representative nuclei such as 16O

experimental data, which have been taken into account. Table6.1 lists some exam-

while SIII gives too hard EOS.10
6.2.4
Comparison with the Experimental Data
The Hartree–Fock calculations assuming the Skyrme force well reproduce the exper-
imental data of fundamental observables such as the nuclear radii and the charge
distributions. As an example of the comparison with the experimental data, Fig.6.1
compares the energy levels for nucleons obtained by the Hartree–Fock calculations
using SkM∗and SLy4 forces with the experimental data. The ﬁgure shows that the
Hartree–Fock calculations with the Skyrme force well reproduce the features of the
experimental data for the single-particle levels.
However, if one examines closely, it is noticed that the Hartree–Fock calculations
give too large level spacing, i.e., smaller level density, compared with the experimen-
tal data. That trend is more signiﬁcant for the SLy4 force than for the SkM∗force,
especially, for neutrons. The two forces give similar results for protons. In order to
see the origin of this problem and its feature, we compare in Fig.6.2 the effective
mass and potentials of nucleons obtained for each calculation. The ﬁgure shows that
Fig. 6.1 Nucleon energy levels near the Fermi surface. Comparison of the experimental data with
the Hartree–Fock calculations using the SkM∗and SLy4 forces

the effective mass in the Hartree–Fock calculations is signiﬁcantly smaller than the
bare mass. Moreover, it shows that the effective mass for neutrons is considerably
smaller for SLy4 force than that for SkM∗force. On the other hand, the effective mass
for protons is nearly the same for two forces. Since the level spacing in the square
well potential increases with decreasing mass (see Eq. (5.10)), the above mentioned
problem of the Hartree–Fock calculations concerning the nucleon level density could
be sought one of its origins in the incorrect treatment of the effective mass, i.e., in
that they ignore the e-mass, which we discuss later.

6.2.5.1
The Equation of State and Saturation
The equation of state is one of the fundamental properties of a physical system and
is often expressed by representing the pressure as a function of density. One can
analytically write down the equation of state if one assumes the Skyrme force. The
equation of state plays an important role in various problems such as the nuclear
saturation, compressional vibrational excitation, nuclear fragmentation reactions11
and astrophysical phenomena such as neutron stars and supernova explosions. Here,
we discuss the equation of state for the nuclear matter with N = Z based on the
Skyrme force. We ignore the Coulomb force.

MeV per nucleon, where the colliding nuclei dissociate into nucleons and fragments with various
small mass numbers.

(6.49)
Since the internal energy E is given by the sum of the interaction energy Eint and
the kinetic energy Ekin, we divide the pressure into the part originating from the
interaction energy and that from the kinetic energy
P = PV + PT .

that the interaction energy per nucleon is given by

(6.51)
We have changed the power in the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.51) by
considering the general case when the nuclear force is given by Eq. (6.29) instead of
Eq. (6.28), although Eq. (6.46) corresponds to the case when α = 1.12 The pressure
due to the interaction is then given by
PV = −C1ρ2 + (1 + α)C2ρ2+α .

by using Eq. (6.54).
Let us guess the behaviour of the equation of state based on these results. We ﬁrst
consider the case when the temperature is 0. Equations (6.52) and (6.55) suggest that
the effect of kinetic energy, i.e., the degeneracy pressure, dominates in the region
of low density and the pressure is positive and increases with density. Eventually,
the pressure due to attractive two-body interaction becomes to overcome and the

pressure decreases with density and turns to be negative. For even higher density,
the pressure turns to increase with density because of the three-body force or the
density-dependent force, i.e., the second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.52),
which have been introduced to guarantee the saturation, and becomes 0 at the normal
density ρ0 ∼0.17 fm−3, for which the nucleus exists as a stable isolated system, and
then continues to increase. However, it is necessary to reﬁne the theory by taking
into account the effect of repulsive core and various effects, which are ignored in
Eq. (6.55), in order to discuss the region of very high density.13 As Eq. (6.61) shows,
the pressure increases with increasing temperature and eventually converges to the
equation of state for the classical ideal gas given by Eq. (6.59).
Figure6.3 shows the equation of state drawn based on these considerations.
Roughly speaking, the pressure behaves like a cubic function of the density at low
temperatures, and becomes a monotonically increasing function of density at tem-
peratures higher than the critical temperature TC.
Finally, we express the equation of state in the form of the energy density H (ρ).
To that end, we remark that the incompressibility deﬁned by Eq. (6.47) can be
expressed also as

13The equation of state at high density is one of the crucial issues in the problems of the neutron stars
and the supernova explosions. However, it is not precisely known yet. Concerning neutron stars, it
has been reported that the pressure gets lower if one takes into account baryons other than protons
and neutrons, that is, hyperons. This is natural, because for a given baryon density the degeneracy
pressure must decrease if more different kinds of baryon exist. A problem is that the softening
of the equation of state by the presence of hyperons contradicts the experimental observation of
massive neutron stars with the mass as large as about two times the solar mass. This problem
is often referred to as the hyperon puzzle or the hyperon crisis. Various possibilities such as the
recovery of the stiffness of the equation of state at the high density side due to the repulsive effect
of a three-body force working universally among all baryons [11] are now under investigation to
resolve this puzzle and to establish a theory which is compatible with the data of both neutron stars
and hypernuclei [12]. In this connection, we note that the density at deep inside of neutron stars is
thought to be signiﬁcantly higher than the normal nuclear density, although the actual value is not
known and varies over a wide range between 4 and 8 times the normal nuclear density depending
on the theoretical models.

where ρ0 is the density of nucleus in the ground state. Equation (6.62) shows that

Eq. (6.64) is the term representing the Weizsäcker correction.
6.2.5.2
Liquid–Gas Phase Transition, Spinodal Line
The behaviour shown in Fig.6.3 resembles the van der Waals equation of state.
Like van der Waals, the problem of liquid–gas phase transition in nuclei, which
are self-bound systems with ﬁnite number of constituents interacting through strong
interactions, has been discussed based on this equation of state in connection with
the fragmentation reactions in medium energy nucleus–nucleus collisions [14].
The nucleus once becomes a state of high temperature and high density after the
collision at high energy, then cools down nearly isentropically with expansion, and
eventually is observed as fragments of various masses including nuclei with relatively
large mass number. In this procedure, the region of negative nuclear incompressibility
plays an important role as the region of mechanical instability. This can be understood
in the following way.
Let us consider the Helmholtz free energy density F ≡F
Aρ corresponding to
the Hamiltonian density H ≡E
Aρ introduced by Eq. (6.44). By taking the second

The condition ∂2F

Figure6.4 shows the mechanically unstable region, whose boundary is called the

and is expected to be required in order to reach instability region after cooling in the

6.2.5.3
Surface Diffuseness
The surface property of nuclei is one of the intriguing physical quantities concern-
ing nuclear structure as well as nuclear reactions. Equation (6.63) suggests that the
parameter B given by Eq. (6.64) is related to the surface thickness. In fact, using
Eq. (6.63) one can show [15] that the density distribution of nuclei is given by
ρ = ρ0 tanh2

(6.73)
b2 = 9 B

(6.74)
If we approximate the functional form of Eq. (6.73) by the standard Woods–Saxon
type, then the surface diffuseness parameter a is given by a ≈2b/3. Equations (6.74)
and (6.64) suggest that the surface thickness of nuclei is governed by the nuclear
incompressibility and the Weizsäcker term in the asymptotic surface region, where
the density is extremely small, or by the range of nuclear force through the parameter
9t1 −(5 + 4x2)t2 in more inside region.
6.2.6
Beyond the Hartree–Fock Calculations:
Nucleon–Vibration Coupling; ω-Mass
We remarked in Sect.6.2.4 that the single-particle level density obtained by the
Hartree–Fock calculations is too small compared with the experimental data, and
suggested the possibility that one of the reasons of this failure is related to the
effective mass.
The effective mass hitherto discussed within the framework of the Hartree–Fock
theory arises from the antisymmetrization of nucleons. In revised theories which go
beyond the Hartree–Fock approximation, the single-particle potential has an energy
dependent correction term in addition to the potential UHF in the Hartree–Fock theory
due to, e.g., the coupling of nucleons to the surface vibration, which is one of the
nuclear collective excitations. In consequence, the energy of the single-particle state
is given by
e = p2
2m + UHF(r, p(r)) + UPVC(r, e) .
(6.75)

The lower index PVC in the third term on the right-hand side means particle–
vibration coupling. We denoted the bare nucleon mass MN by m. Also, we rep-
resented the Hartree–Fock potential by an equivalent momentum dependent local
potential in the spirit of the WKB approximation, although it is in general a non-
local potential.
By taking the derivative of both sides of Eq. (6.75) with respect to p, and using
the deﬁnition of the effective mass

(6.78)
where mk stands for k-mass and mω for ω-mass or e-mass.
The ω-mass mω is larger than the bare mass m, and is concentrated in the surface
region reﬂecting the coupling between nucleons and the surface vibrational motion
[16]. Thanks to the ω-mass, the ﬁnal effective mass becomes larger than the k-
mass introduced in the Hartree–Fock approximation. Hence the agreement between
the theoretical value and the experimental data concerning the single-particle level
density is improved by taking into account the effect of particle–vibration coupling.
Incidentally, this is related to the fact that the parameter a,14 which is called the
level density parameter, takes the value A/8MeV−1 in the region of low excitation
energy in contradiction to the expectation. The ω-mass approaches 1 with increas-
ing excitation energy. Consequently, the level density parameter a is expected to
approach the expected value A/15MeV−1 as the excitation energy increases. It has
been conﬁrmed that it is the case indeed from the study of, e.g., the excitation energy
dependence of the evaporation spectrum of α particles from excited nuclei [18].

Relativistic Mean-Field Theory (σωρ Model)
Theoretical studies which use the relativistic theory and introduce mesons to mediate
the nuclear force have also been extensively developed to determine nuclear proper-
ties such as the binding energy and the shape of nuclei within the framework of the
mean-ﬁeld theory in parallel with the non-relativistic Hartree–Fock theory with the
Skyrme force. The relativistic approach has the advantage that the spin–orbit force is
14If one considers the nucleus as a Fermi gas, then the level density ρL exponentially increases with
the excitation energy E and can be roughly given by ρL(E) ∼exp(aE)1/2 (see [17] for details).

naturally introduced.15,16 In this section, we learn the σωρ model, which is a widely
used relativistic mean-ﬁeld theory17 [20, 21].

in terms of the ﬁeld operators of nucleons ψ and mesons σ, ω, ρ.19 U(σ) is the
potential energy term of the σ meson. We assume that it is given by
U(σ) = 1
2m2
σσ 2 + 1
3g2σ 3 + 1
4g3σ 4 .
(6.80)
The second and third terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.80), which are often
called non-linear terms, are the self-interaction terms of the σ mesons and have been
introduced in order to reproduce the experimental data of the binding energy per
particle and Fermi momentum of the nuclear matter as well as the surface energy
and surface thickness of nuclei.20
15Another attractive point of the relativistic treatment is that one can reproduce the saturation
property of nuclei within the framework of the mean-ﬁeld theory. Although it is different from the
relativisticmean-ﬁeldtheorywhichwedescribeinthissection,inthecaseoftheBrueckner–Hartree–
Fock calculations using the nuclear force obtained from the experimental data of the nucleon–
nucleon scattering, the relativistic treatment can simultaneously reproduce the Fermi momentum
and the binding energy per nucleon of the nuclear matter. On the other hand, if one uses non-
relativistic theories, there exists a correlation between the Fermi momentum and the binding energy
per nucleon, called the Coester line, and one cannot simultaneously reproduce both of them in the
way to match with the mass formula irrespective of the nuclear force.
16The relativistic approach reproduces the experimental data of the polarization phenomena in the
proton–nucleus scattering much better than the non-relativistic approach.
17The π mesons are not introduced, because one tries to establish the theory under the mean-ﬁeld
approximation as will be described later. Recently, the theory which explicitly includes the π mesons
is also being developed (see, e.g., [19]).
18In this section, we use the natural units, where one sets ℏ= 1, c = 1.
19μ and ν denote the four-dimensional time–space components (see Appendix A.10), while a the
component in the isospin space.
20As Eq. (6.74) shows, the surface thickness of nuclei is intimately related to the nuclear incompress-
ibility. The incompressibility K takes a large value of about 500MeV if the non-linear terms are not
introduced, and the surface properties of nuclei are not well reproduced. The value K ∼500MeV
is too large also in comparison with about 210MeV, which is suggested from the experimental value
of the excitation energy of the breathing mode.

The Mean-Field Theory
Equations (6.85)–(6.89) are the equations for the ﬁeld operators, so that it is not easy
to solve them as they are. One therefore usually introduces the approximation that
replaces the operators by their expectation values, which are c-numbers,
σ →⟨σ⟩= σ(r)
(6.94)
ωμ →⟨ωμ⟩= ωμ(r).
(6.95)
The resulting theory is called the mean-ﬁeld theory.
Consequently, we obtain

ﬁelds. See Appendix A.10 for the notations and the variables that appear in the above
equations.
Equations (6.96)–(6.99) show that a scalar and a vector ﬁelds act on nucleons due
to the interaction with the meson and the electromagnetic ﬁelds, and that the effect
of the σ meson appears as a space dependent effective mass.
The relativistic mean-ﬁeld theory usually assumes the time-reversal symmetry
and is applied to even–even nuclei. In this case, the total current density becomes
zero, so that the spatial components of the vector potential becomes zero (V(r) = 0)
as seen from Eqs. (6.101)–(6.103).

Prologue to How to Solve the Mean-Field Equations
Here, we brieﬂy explain the practical method to solve the equations of the relativistic
mean-ﬁeld theory. For spherical nuclei [22, 23], we express the wave function of a

by noting that the good quantum number is not (ℓ, s = 1
2, mℓ, ms), but (ℓ, s, j, m j =

The mΦ is taken to be the mass of the corresponding meson if Φ is either σ or
ω or ρ mesons, and zero if Φ is photon. One then solves these coupled equations
self-consistently by an iteration method with either the expansion method using
the harmonic oscillator wave functions as the expansion basis or with the direct
integration method by discretizing the space into small lattices.
We describe actual applications in Sect.7.6.2 by taking the study of nuclear shape
as an example after we learn pairing correlations.
6.3.5
Non-relativistic Approximation and the Spin–Orbit
Coupling
We learnt in Sect.5.2.5 that the spin–orbit coupling plays a crucial role in determining
the magic numbers and the stability of nuclei. Here, we introduce the non-relativistic
approximation by using the Tani–Foldy–Wouthuysen transformation (TFW transfor-
mation), and obtain the information on the one-body spin–orbit coupling from the
relativistic mean-ﬁeld theory.
The TFW transformation gradually removes the odd power terms of α which
admix the small and large components from the equation by repeating the unitary
transformation which makes the small components, i.e., the third and fourth com-
ponents, contained in the relativistic wave function small, and thus increases the
accuracy of the approximation in the power series of the inverse of the mass [22, 24].
By performing the TFW transformation on Eq. (6.96), we obtain the following
Hamiltonian for the spin–orbit coupling,

Equation (6.113) is the equation for the large components, i.e., the ﬁrst and second
components, of the Dirac spinor.21, 22
21Note that the central force is governed by V + S in contrast to the ℓ· s force (see Eq. (6.106)).
22The case of electrons in atoms corresponds to the case when there exists only the V term. Thanks
to the S term, the sign of the spin–orbit potential for nucleons inside a nucleus becomes opposite
to that for the electrons in atoms [25].

If we express the V (r) −S(r) in terms of the meson ﬁelds by using Eqs. (6.97)
and (6.98), and determine each meson ﬁeld by approximating the left-hand side of
Eq. (6.109) with the mass term, then we have

where ρB is the baryon density (nucleon density), ρE and ρN E are the densities of
nucleons which have the equal or non-equal isospin to that of the nucleon under con-
sideration, respectively. In transforming from Eqs. (6.114) to (6.115), we remarked
Eq. (6.111) and assumed that the main components of the Dirac spinor are much
larger than the small components (|G| ≫|F|).
Since the nucleon density decreases with r, the results shown in Eqs. (6.113)
and (6.115) match the attractive nature of the spin–orbit coupling, i.e., that vLS is
negative as we learnt phenomenologically in Chap.5. Also, they show that the spin–
orbit coupling is strong in the surface region where the density variation is large.
Furthermore, Eq. (6.115) suggests that the spin–orbit coupling depends on the isospin
due to the spin–orbit coupling stemming from the coupling to ρ mesons, hence that
it is necessary to revise the isospin-independent spin-dependent term (W0 term)
assumed in the original Skyrme force. This effect is important, e.g., in understanding
the isotope shift of nuclear radius over a wide range across a magic number.23
The spin–orbit coupling is expected to have different effects in stable nuclei and
in unstable nuclei in the vicinity of the limit of existence through the difference of
the surface properties and the isospin dependence. The exploration of such effects
will be an interesting subject.

Parameter Sets
Table6.2 shows several parameter sets which have been used for actual calculations.
The common notation NL stands for non-linear.
23Sharma [26] succeeded in explaining the kink phenomenon which the radii of Pb isotopes show
when they cross the neutron magic number N = 126 by replacing the W0 term in Eq. (6.25) with
iW0(1 + xw Pτ)(σ 1 + σ 2) · kL × δ(r1 −r2)kR.

Pairing Correlation
6.4.1
Overview
We learnt in Sect.2.3.1 that the binding energy per nucleon for even–even nuclei is
systematically larger than that for odd nuclei and that for odd–odd nuclei. Also, by
using 210
82 Pb as an example, we have shown in Sect.5.8 that the level structure, i.e.,
the spin, parity and the level spacing, of the ground state and low-lying excited states
of doubly-magic ±2 nuclei can be explained by taking into account the short-range
residual interaction, which is ignored in the mean ﬁeld, i.e., in the zeroth order shell
model.
In general, detailed examination of the role of residual interactions which are not
included in the mean ﬁeld is necessary to understand the nuclear properties in detail.
Of the residual interactions the especially important is the pairing correlation. The
ground state and low-lying excited states of nuclei become superﬂuid due to the
pairing interaction. As stated in the beginning of this section, the pairing correlation
strongly affects the binding energy of nuclei as well as the low-lying level structure,
i.e., the spin, parity and the distribution of the excitation energies of low-lying states.
Furthermore, as we will learn later, it plays an important role in determining the
shapes of nuclei. Also, the pairing correlation has a strong inﬂuence on various
phenomena and quantities such as the moment of inertia of the rotational motion of
deformed nuclei and the cross section of two-nucleon transfer reactions.

6.4 Pairing Correlation
163
The pairing interaction among electrons, which makes metals superﬂuid, is
induced through the electron–phonon coupling [27]. In contrast, the pairing correla-
tion in nuclei originates partly from the direct attractive interaction between nucleons
and partly from the mechanism that the pair of nucleons, which occupy time-reversal
states to each other in the vicinity of Fermi surface, form a Cooper pair via surface
vibrations (see Ref. [28] for details).
In solid state physics, the origin of superﬂuidity depends on the system. For
example, it is known that many metals and alloys become superﬂuid by the 1S pair,
while heavy electron systems and liquid 3He become superﬂuid by 3P pair [27]. The
mechanism to become superﬂuid depends on the system for the nucleus as well. In
this section, by having the ground and low-lying excited states of stable nuclei in
mind, we discuss the role and the theoretical treatment of the main pairing correlation
due to the pair of nucleons in the isospin-triplet and spin-singlet state, i.e., in the 1S
state.24
6.4.2
Multipole Expansion of the Pairing Correlation,
Monopole Pairing Correlation Model and Quasi-Spin
Formalism
Let us ﬁrst consider the behaviour of the residual interaction and its effect in the case
when a single-particle level with total angular momentum j is occupied by nucleons.
Here, we use the second quantization representation. The residual interaction V is
in general represented by two creation and two annihilation operators, because it is
a two-body operator. Since Hamiltonian is a tensor of rank-0, we can represent V as
V =

J=even
E J

M
C+(J M)C−(J M) ,
(6.116)
C+(J M) ≡

jma†
j M−m[1 + (−1)J] ,
(6.117)
C−(J M) = C†
+(J M) ,
(6.118)
by separately coupling two creation and two annihilation operators into a reduced
tensor.
The J = 0 term in Eq. (6.116) is called the monopole pairing, and the other terms
multipole pairing, i.e., the quadrupole pairing etc. As Table5.3 shows, the monopole
pairing is much stronger than multipole pairing when the residual interaction is given
by the δ function. Hence one often approximates V by keeping only the monopole
24In neutron stars, it is considered that neutrons in the outer region with low density called crust
are in the 1S0 superﬂuid state, the neutrons in more inner region with high density are in the 3P2
superﬂuid state, and protons are in the 1S0 superﬂuid state. Also, these superﬂuidities are considered
to play important roles in the cooling and the phenomena called glitches of pulsars. See [29].

term. This is called the monopole pairing model. In that case, the residual interaction
is given by25

(6.122)
Using the so-called quasi-spin formalism [1], one can analytically show that the
degeneracy of the energy levels of the N-body system | j N⟩is then resolved and the
resulting levels can be classiﬁed according to the quantum number named seniority
s, which represents the number of unpaired nucleons, i.e., the number of nucleons
whose pairwise angular momentum is not coupled to zero.
Especially, in the case when N = 2, i.e., when the number of valence nucleons is
2, the seniority s is either s = 0 or s = 2, and all the energies for the J = 2, 4, 6, . . .
states corresponding to s = 2 are degenerate and only the energy of the J = 0 state
for s = 0 gets lower. This result well represents the main feature of the level structure
of 210
82 Pb which we learnt in Sect.5.8 (Table5.3) as an example of the doubly-magic
±2 nuclei by emphasizing the characteristic property of the pairing correlation with
the assumption that there exists only the monopole pairing correlation.
6.4.3
BCS Theory
The quasi-spin formalism can be applied not only to the case when the pairing
interaction is weak, so that the single level approximation is applicable like the
case which we described in the previous section, but to other cases as well. For
example, if there exist many close lying levels, then one will be able to apply the
quasi-spin formalism by considering those levels as approximately degenerate levels,
and by considering them as a single energy level with a large effective angular
momentum. Recently, there are attempts of the quasi-spin formalism which does
not introduce the degeneracy approximation. However, more general and standard
treatments which handle the energy distribution of plural single-particle energy levels
as it is are the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) or the Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov
(HFB) theories. In this section, we learn the BCS theory.
25Since ⟨j jm −m|00⟩= (−) j−m/√2 j + 1, S+ and S−are the creation and annihilation operators,
respectively, of the pair of nucleons whose total angular momentum couples to 0.

6.4.3.1
The Time-Reversed State Representation of the Monopole
Pairing Correlation Model
Before we describe the BCS theory, let us reconsider the meaning of the monopole
pairing correlation model given by Eqs. (6.119)–(6.122) from the point of view of
the correlation between the time-reversed states.
We ﬁx the phase such that the time-reversed state is given by
|αJ M⟩=
ˆ
T |αJ M⟩= (−1)J−M|αJ −M⟩,
(6.123)
when we represent the single-particle state as |αJ M⟩by using the magnitude of
the angular momentum J, the magnitude of its z-component M and the additional
quantum number α. The
ˆ
T is the time-reversal operator, and is given by
ˆ
T = −iσy ˆK
(6.124)
with the operator ˆK, which implies to take complex conjugate of all c-numbers.26
Exercise 6.3 Following the time-reversal operator deﬁned by Eq. (6.124), show that
the time-reversed state is given by Eq. (6.123) if we deﬁne the single-particle state
as
|nℓjm⟩= Rnℓ(r)

Hint: Use the following property of the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients:
⟨j1 j2m1m2|J M⟩= (−1) j1+ j2−J⟨j1 j2 −m1 −m2|J −M⟩.
Note that the phase iℓin Eq. (6.125) has been introduced to guarantee the phase in
Eq. (6.123).
Using Eqs. (6.123), (6.119) can be rewritten as
V = −G

m>0,m′>0

jma†
jma jm′a jm′ .
(6.126)
Equation (6.126) shows that the monopole pairing model is the model which assumes
that the residual interaction works only between the states which are time reversal to
each other. This corresponds to that the Cooper pair of electrons in metals is formed
for the pair of electrons which are in the time-reversed states (k ↑, −k ↓) to each
other. Remark that the phase which appears in the quasi-spin to deﬁne the monopole
pair and the phase which appears as the result of time-reversal operation are both
(−1) j−m and identical with each other.
26For Eq. (6.123) and correspondingly also for Eq. (6.124), we determined the phase in the same way
as that in Ref. [30]. In Ref. [17], the phase of Eq. (6.123) is taken to be (−1)J+M. Correspondingly,
the time-reversal operator is taken to be ˆ
T = iσy ˆK.

Microscopic Mean-Field Theory (Hartree–Fock Theory)
6.4.3.2
HF+BCS Theory
One of the standard methods to theoretically explore the structure of nuclei is ﬁrst
to determine single-particle levels in the mean ﬁeld by using, for example, either
the non-relativistic mean-ﬁeld calculations such as the Skyrme Hartree–Fock calcu-
lations or the relativistic mean-ﬁeld theory, then to take into account the effects of
the residual interaction by the BCS theory. This method is often called the Hartree–
Fock+BCS theory.
Here, we proceed by having a non-relativistic theory in mind. We denote the
single-particle state determined by the Hartree–Fock equation by |k⟩. As we discuss
in Chap.7, most nuclei except for those whose proton or neutron numbers are either
one of the magic numbers or in their vicinity are deformed. The nℓjm which we
used to write Eq. (6.126) are therefore not in general good quantum numbers for
the eigenstates of the Hartree–Fock equation. Instead, as we learn in Sect.7.4, |k⟩is
given by a superposition of the states which have nℓjm as quantum numbers,
|k⟩=

α={nℓjm}
Dαk|α⟩.
(6.127)
However, one can deﬁne the time-reversed state by |¯k⟩≡
ˆ
T |k⟩in the deformed case
as well. In many cases, the study is performed by assuming an axially-symmetric
deformation. In that case, the magnitude of the projection of the total angular momen-
tum along the symmetry axis m = Ω is a good quantum number, and the magnitude
of the projection of the total angular momentum of the time-reversed state along the
symmetry axis is −m = −Ω.
In the BCS theory, one assumes that the total Hamiltonian is given by
ˆH =

k>0
εk(a†
kak + a†
¯ka¯k) −G

k,k′>0
a†
ka†
¯ka¯k′ak′ ,
(6.128)
by extending Eq. (6.126). The summation is taken over the states whose component
of the angular momentum along the symmetry axis is positive.
Equation (6.128) implies that nucleons pairwise occupy the time-reversed states
to each other. Hence we assume that the total wave function is given by
|BCS⟩=

(6.129)

k = 1 .
(6.130)
The v2
k represents the probability that the pair of nucleons occupy the k, ¯k levels,
and Eq. (6.130) is the normalization condition. The |0⟩is the vacuum state. The
wave function assumed by Eq. (6.129) is in general a mixture of different number
of nucleons N. Therefore, introducing the Lagrange multiplier λ in order to ﬁx

(6.133)
Since the nucleus is a many-body system with a small number of constituents, the
ﬂuctuation of the particle number is a serious problem. Various methods such as the
projection operator method which projects on the state with ﬁxed number of particles
or the double constraint method which gives constraint on both the mean value and
the ﬂuctuation of the particle number have been invented27 [31–33].
Equations (6.131) and (6.132) lead to
Δ = G

(εk −λ)2 + Δ2 .
(6.134)
Equation (6.134) is called the gap equation, and determines the gap parameter Δ.
If the pairing correlation is sufﬁciently strong, or if there are plenty of levels in the
vicinity of the Fermi surface, there exists a solution of ﬁnite value of Δ besides
the trivial solution Δ = 0. The former is the superﬂuid state. Figure6.5 shows the
occupation probability of each single-particle level v2
k as a function of the single-
particle energy εk for the case when Δ is ﬁnite. The ﬁgure shows that the occupation
probability of each level deviates from 1 or 0, and hence the distribution near the
Fermi surface becomes blurred due to the pairing correlation.28
27The quasi-spin method is advantageous in the sense that it has no ﬂuctuation of the particle number,
although it is difﬁcult to be applied to general cases because of the restriction on the degeneracy of
the energy levels.
28Equation (6.128) corresponds to the monopole pairing correlation approximation described in the
previous section. In more advanced treatments the strength of the pairing correlation G depends on
the states and is generalized to Gkk′. As the result, the gap parameter becomes state dependent Δk,
and the gap equation is generalized to [34]

6.4.4
The Magnitude of the Gap Parameter
One of the standard ways to determine the magnitude of the gap parameter Δ is to
estimate it phenomenologically from the binding energies of nuclei by remarking that
the binding energies systematically differ for odd, odd–odd and even–even nuclei
due to the pairing correlation (see Sect.2.3.1). Practically, we use, for example,
Δn = 1
4 [B(A −2, Z) −3B(A −1, Z) + 3B(A, Z) −B(A + 1, Z)] ,
(6.136)
Δp = 1
4 [B(A −2, Z −2)−3B(A −1, Z −1)+3B(A, Z)−B(A + 1, Z + 1)] ,
(6.137)
for even–even nuclei. Figure6.6 shows thus obtained gap parameter for neutrons Δn
as a function of the mass number.29 The Δp behaves in a similar way. As is written
in the ﬁgure, the average behaviour of Δ can be well represented by
Δ ∼12
√
A
MeV
(6.138)
for both neutrons and protons.30
For nuclei in the vicinity of doubly-magic ±2 nuclei, the magnitude of the gap
parameter Δ can be estimated also from the level spacing of low-lying states.
For example, in the case of 210
82 Pb, the level structure shown in Fig.5.6 gives
2Δ ∼1.3MeV, yielding Δ ∼0.7MeV. This value well matches the empirical for-
mula (6.138).
One can also theoretically determine Δ so as to be consistent with Hartree–
Fock calculations by solving the gap equation (6.134) once the strength of the pair-
ing correlation G is known. According to Nilsson and Prior [38], Gp ≈17/AMeV
for protons and Gn ≈25/A MeV for neutrons. Also, Nilsson and Ragnarsson [39]
29The masses of nuclei have been taken from [35].
30There exist also empirical formulae which take into account the isospin dependence [36].

suggest that Gp ≈26/A MeV, Gn ≈20.5/A MeV for the nuclei in the rare-earth
region. One can ﬁnd some estimates also in [28].31
We discuss in Sect.7.6.2 the correlation between the shape of nuclei and the
nuclear superﬂuidity by ﬁrst estimating G globally, and then by determining Δ as a
function of nuclear deformation by solving the gap equation.
6.4.5
The Coherence Length
Here, we remark the spatial extension of the Cooper pair.
The coherence length or the correlation length ξ, which gives the measure of the
spatial extension of the pairing correlation, is given by [27, 28]
ξ = ℏvF
2Δ .
(6.139)
Exercise 6.4 Derive Eq. (6.139) based on the idea of the uncertainty relation.
Since vF is about 30% of the speed of light, Eq. (6.138) shows that the coherence
length of the pairing correlation in stable nuclei is longer than the nuclear size, i.e.,
the diameter 2R ∼2 × 1.2A1/3 fm. For example, for 210Pb, 2R ∼14.3fm, while
ξ ∼35.7fm.
As Eq. (2.40) shows, the Fermi momentum gets smaller when the nuclear density
becomes smaller. From Eq. (6.139) one can therefore expect that the coherence length
becomes small in the region where the nuclear density is small. As a related topic, it
is being argued recently in connection with unstable nuclei that the spatial property
of the Cooper pair changes from that in the case of normal density when the nuclear
density gets smaller than the nuclear saturation density ρ0, and that there appears a
spatially localized two-body correlation [41].
31One needs to determine the magnitude of G and the range of states k over which the sum is taken
on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.134) in a consistent way [40].

Chapter 7
The Shapes of Nuclei
Abstract The nucleus behaves like a liquid drop as the mass formula and the
saturation of density imply. However, a signiﬁcant difference from the classical liquid
drop, which is always spherical in order to make the energy by surface tension min-
imum, is that many nuclei are deformed except for those near the closed shells. The
shape of nuclei is one of the central research subjects of nuclear structure together
with the size of nuclei. The shape of nuclei is intimately related to the collective
excitations of nuclei, and also strongly affects nuclear reactions including heavy-
ion fusion reactions (see Balantekin and Takigawa, Rev. Mod. Phys. 70, 77 (1998);
Dasgupta et al., Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sci. 48, 401 (1998); Hagino et al., Comput.
Phys. Commun. 123, 143 (1999); Esbensen, Nucl. Phys. A 352, 147 (1981); Hagino
and Takigawa, Butsuri 57, 588 (2002); Hagino and Takigawa, Prog. Theor. Phys. 128,
1001 (2012) [1–6]). In this chapter we describe several basic concepts concerning
the shape of nuclei.
7.1
The Observables Relevant to the Nuclear Shape:
Multipole Moments and the Excitation Spectrum
As pointed out in Chap.4, the magnitude of the electric quadrupole moment provides
direct information on the nuclear shape, more precisely, on whether the distribution
of protons inside the nucleus is spherical or deformed. We learn in Sect.8.3 that
the electromagnetic transitions give related valuable information on the shape of
the nucleus. Figures7.1a and 7.1b show the energy levels of 166
68 Er and 167
68 Er in the
vicinity of the ground state taken from [7] (the excitation energies are in keV).
The level structure of 166
68 Er resembles that for 210Pb and 210Po shown in Fig.5.6
in the sense that the I π = 0+, 2+, 4+, 6+, 8+ levels appear in low energy region in
this order. However, it signiﬁcantly differs in that the level spacing increases with
increasing angular momentum I. The level spacing well agrees with the spectrum
EI = ℏ2I (I + 1)/2I , I being the moment of inertia, of the rotational motion,
which is a characteristic collective motion of statically deformed nuclei. The level
structure of 167
68 Er is similar. Figures7.1a and 7.1b therefore suggest that these nuclei
are deformed nuclei.

In this way, the level structure of nuclei also provides important information on
the shape of nuclei.

that the Sm isotopes change their shape from the spherical shape to the deformed
shape as the neutron number increases from the magic number N = 82 (the phase
transition of the nuclear shape, i.e., the shape transition).
Figure7.3 shows the region in the nuclear chart where nuclei are deformed in their
ground state. Those nuclei have been selected as the nuclei, which have either the
ground-state rotational band or whose E4/E2 ratio is large, where E2 is the excitation
energy of the ﬁrst 2+ state and E4 that of the ﬁrst 4+ state except for some shape
coexisting nuclei.2 They are sorted according to the value of E4/E2.
Typical deformed nuclei are located in the regions of rare earth such as Er isotopes
and actinides such as U isotopes. In addition, 8Be, 12C, 20Ne, and 24Mg are also
deformed in their ground state. Even if the ground state is spherical, some nuclei have
deformed states in the region of relatively low excitation energy. Also, there exist
nuclei which have states with different deformations in the same energy region. They
are called the shape coexistence. 16O and some of the Ge isotopes are representative
examples of these nuclei.3 Ge isotopes are also known to make shape transition in
the ground state from the spherical shape to a deformed shape as the neutron number
increases.
2The excitation energy of each level has been taken either from the Table of Isotopes [7] or from
http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/.
3Light Hg isotopes are known to be the nuclei with shape coexistence [8]. They have a rotational
bandofprolateshapeintheregionofalowexcitationenergyinadditiontotheground-staterotational
band of oblate shape. The excitation energy of the 4+ member of the prolate band becomes lower
than that of the 4+ member of the oblate ground-state band for the isotopes whose mass number
is 186 or smaller. Hence we used the excitation energy of the second 4+ state for E4 for the
182,184,186Hg isotopes in making Fig.7.3. We have omitted 180Hg from the ﬁgure, since the level
structure is presently unclear.

Deformation Parameters
Various deformation parameters are conventionally used to represent nuclear defor-
mation. Here, we list some of them and discuss their properties and connections
among them. We introduced the deformation parameters αλ by Eq. (2.66) in order to
describe ﬁssion. The parameter δ which is deﬁned by
δ ≡3

(7.1)
is also often used when the deformation is axially symmetric by assigning the sym-
metry axis to the third axis, which we sometimes call the z-axis in the following. The
R3 and R⊥represent the equivalent radii in the direction of the symmetry axis, and
in the perpendicular direction, respectively.
For general deformations, one expands the radius as

The indices ncs and ocs in Eq. (7.6) represent the components after and before
the rotational transformation, respectively. Equation (7.6) shows that {αλμ} forms a
tensor of rank-λ and that αλμ is its μ component (see Sect. A.6).
Exercise 7.1 Show Eqs. (7.4)–(7.6).
We have shown in Fig.2.21 the shape of deformation for λ = 2, 3 and 4in con-
nection with ﬁssion.4 The surface vibrations of spherical nuclei can be described by
using αλμ as dynamical variables (geometrical collective model).5 Those vibrations
correspond to the oscillations of the deviation of the shape from the spherical shape
shown in Fig.2.21 as functions of time. The vibrations for λ = 2 and 3 are called the
quadrupole and octupole vibrations, respectively. Figure.7.4 conceptually shows the
quadrupole vibration as an example.
For statically deformed nuclei, it is more convenient to use the Euler angles, which
show the direction of principal axes, instead of the αλμ as a part of the variables in
order to describe collective motions. As an example, let us consider the case of
the quadrupole deformation. There are originally 2(2λ + 1) variables, since αλμ are
complex numbers. Among them 2λ + 1 variables are independent, since there exist

2λ + 1 conditions because of Eq. (7.4). Hence if λ = 2, there are two independent
variables besides three Euler angles. On the other hand, since {αλμ} is a tensor of
rank λ, the variables α2μ in the space-ﬁxed coordinate system are transformed to new
variables a2ν in the nucleus ﬁxed coordinate system, i.e., the body-ﬁxed coordinate
system, where the coordinate axes are taken along the principal axes of the nucleus,
by a rotation of the coordinate system:

By taking the Euler angles in the direction of the principal axes, we have
a21 = a2−1 = 0,

(7.10)
The Euler angles φ, θ, ψ and the real variables a22, a20 become new variables.

γ is the parameter for discussing the axial symmetry. Equation (7.12) shows that

where the 3, 1 and 2 axes are the symmetry axes, respectively.
2. γ = 180◦, 300◦, 60◦represent the oblate type of axially symmetric deformation
where the 3, 1 and 2 axes are the symmetry axes, respectively.
3. The γ which is not a multiple of 60◦represents a triaxial deformation.
4. One can represent all the shapes by using only the region β ≥0, 0◦≤γ ≤60◦
in the case of quadrupole deformation. The other regions of β, γ can be reached
by suitable transformations.

The Deformed Shell Model
Let us study the distribution of energy levels for nucleons inside a deformed nucleus.
One can then understand the origin of nuclear deformation.
AsEq.(5.4)shows,intheapproximationtosettherangeofthenuclearforcetozero
the single-particle potential for nucleons is proportional to the density of nucleons.
This implies that the mean ﬁeld is also deformed if the nucleus is deformed. This is
called the self-consistency condition.
Suppose an axially symmetric deformation and assume that the single-particle
ﬁeld is given by the deformed harmonic oscillator ﬁeld as

Both oscillator parameters ω⊥and ωz must be functions of the magnitude of deforma-
tion δ because of the self-consistency condition. In order to determine their functional
forms, we remark that the shape of the equipotential surfaces of the potential rep-
resented by Eq. (7.15) is given by the ratio of the distances in the directions of the

Hence some literatures, e.g., [13], distinguish it by denoting with a different notation
such as δosc.
Figure7.6 shows how the three levels (six levels if we include the spin), which are
degenerateinthesphericalshape,splitwiththedeformationbytakingthecaseof N =
1 levels as the example. Among them the nz = 0 level is two-fold degenerate (four-
fold degenerate if one includes the spin). For positive δ, i.e., for prolate deformation
which is stretched in the direction of the symmetry axis, the state which has the
ﬁnite quantum number in that direction, i.e., the N = 1, nz = 1 state, in other words,
the state with a smaller |kℓ| (the kℓ= 0 state in the present case), has lower energy,
while for negative δ, i.e., for oblate deformation which is shrunk in the direction of
the symmetry axis, the state which has the ﬁnite quantum number in the direction
perpendicular to the symmetry axis, i.e., the N = 1, nz = 0 state, in other words, the
state with a large |kℓ| value (the kℓ= ±1 state in the present case) has lower energy.
This can be easily expected from the uncertainty principle, which suggests that the
kinetic energy can be smaller if the movable space gets larger.
Note also that the change of the energy due to deformation is larger on the prolate
side if we compare the lower level on the prolate and oblate sides. This can be
understood from Eq. (7.23) which shows that the variation of the energy is given by
2δ/3 for the lower nz = 1 level on the prolate side, while it is given by δ/3 for the
n⊥= 1(nz = 0) level which is the lower level on the oblate side.
Figure7.6suggeststhatthedeformationofnucleusoccursincloseconnectionwith
the shell structure and the Pauli exclusion principle. As an example, let us consider
8
4Be from the point of view of the shell model. The ﬁrst two protons (and neutrons)
occupy the lowest 1s state (N = 0 state). Figure7.6 shows that it is energetically more
favorable to deform the nucleus to the prolate shape and to ﬁll the remaining two
protons (and neutrons) in the nz = 1 level. For this reason, 8Be becomes a deformed
nucleus of prolate type.8 As the number of nucleons increases, it becomes necessary
to ﬁll higher levels with nucleons, and the sign of deformation changes. Roughly

The Shapes of Nuclei
speaking, it can be expected that the nuclei which belong to the beginning of a major
shell have prolate deformation, while those towards the end of the shell oblate. For
example, in the case of N = 1 shell, i.e., the 1p shell, 8Be, which belongs to the
ﬁrst half, has a prolate deformation, while 12C, which belongs to the last half, has an
oblate shape. However, in reality most of the deformed nuclei are prolate, and those
which are oblate in their ground state are limited to 12C and small number of nuclei
such as some of the Hg isotopes, which we mentioned in connection with Fig.7.3
and will discuss again in Sect.7.6.2.
7.4
Nucleon Energy Levels in a Deformed One-Body Field:
Nilsson Levels
The spin–orbit coupling is indispensable in order to discuss real nuclei. Also, the
radial dependence of the harmonic oscillator type is unrealistic. Hence we assume
that the Hamiltonian for nucleons is given by
ˆh = −ℏ2

Δ + MN
2 ω2
⊥(x2 + y2) + MN
2 ω2
z z2 + Cℓ· s + Dℓ2
(7.26)
by extending the deformed harmonic oscillator model introduced in the previous
section. The ℓ2 term has been introduced in order to effectively improve the harmonic
oscillator model so as to yield the level structure for the realistic radial dependence
of the Woods–Saxon type, and is designed in such a way that the states with larger
orbital angular momentum feel stronger attraction (see Fig.5.1). The single-particle
levels obtained by Eq. (7.26) are called Nilsson levels or Nilsson diagram or Nilsson
scheme, since this model was proposed by Nilsson [14] for the ﬁrst time.
The Nilsson levels and the associated wave functions can be obtained by diago-
nalizing the Hamiltonian given by Eq. (7.26) by using a suitable complete set as the
expansion basis. For example, using the wave functions of the deformed shell model
considered in the previous section |α⟩= |NnzkℓΩ⟩as the basis, we expand the wave
function as
|φi=NnzkℓΩ⟩=


and determine the expansion coefﬁcients Ciα and the corresponding single-particle
energy εi by diagonalizing ˆh. Ω = kℓ+ ms is the magnitude of the projection com-
ponent of the total angular momentum along the symmetry axis, where ms is the
magnitude of the projection component of the spin along the symmetry axis.
Figure7.7 shows an example of the Nilsson levels. The followings are some
remarks concerning the Nilsson levels.
particles. However, the overlap between the wave functions of the shell model and of the cluster
model is fairly large.

1. The 2 j + 1 levels, which are degenerate for the spherical shape, split into (2 j +
1)/2 levels by deformation.
2. Each split energy level is twofold degenerate together with the time reversed
state.
3. As the right-hand side of Eq. (7.27) shows, different N, nz, kℓvalues are mixed in
a single energy level. Nevertheless, the set of quantum numbers {N, nz, kℓ, Ω},
which is suitable in the region of large deformation and hence is sometimes called
the asymptotic quantum numbers, is conventionally used as the label for each
Nilsson level. However, the parity, which is determined by N is a good quantum
number, and Ω is also a good quantum number as long as the deformation is
axially symmetric. Note that Ω is not the component of the angular momentum
along a space-ﬁxed axis, but the projection of the angular momentum along an
intrinsic, i.e., body-ﬁxed, axis.

182

The Shapes of Nuclei
4. Roughly speaking, for prolate deformation (δ > 0), the states with small Ω gain
negative energy by deformation and the amount of the gain is larger for smaller
Ω. The shift of energy by deformation gradually changes with Ω, and turns to be
positive for states with large values of Ω. The trend of the effect of deformation
is opposite for oblate deformation. However, the effect of deformation is more
complex for oblate deformation.
7.5
The Spin and Parity of the Ground State of Deformed
Odd Nuclei
One can speculate the spin and parity of the ground state of deformed odd nuclei by
referring to the Nilsson diagram.
Consider 167
68 Er as an example. From the analysis of the inelastic scattering of α
particles, i.e., (α, α′) scattering, it is known that the quadrupole deformation of 166
68 Er
is β2 = 0.276 [16]. If the quadrupole moment of 167
68 Er is assumed to be nearly equal,
then the spin of the ground state of 167
68 Er is predicted to be 7/2 from the Ω value of
the 99th energy level for neutrons in Fig.7.7. Also, the parity is expected to be plus,
since this level results from the split of the i13/2 level. These predictions agree with
the experimental results shown in Fig.7.1b.
7.6
Theoretical Prediction of Nuclear Shape
There are various theoretical methods to conﬁrm nuclear shapes determined or pre-
dicted by experimental data or to predict unknown nuclear shapes. Here, we explain
two standard methods which determine the nuclear shape based on the calculation
of binding energies.
7.6.1
The Strutinsky Method: Macroscopic–Microscopic
Method
One of the methods is the method which reconciles the liquid-drop model and the
shell model. It is called either the macroscopic–microscopic method or the Strutinsky
shell correction method after the name of the inventor [17]. This method gives also the
binding energy of nuclei and the potential surface for ﬁssion with high accuracy [18].
Leaving the detailed explanation of the method to other books [19], here we
mention the basic concept of this method.
As we see in Fig.2.6, the binding energy consists of the part ELDM which smoothly
depends on the mass number and can be well explained by the liquid-drop model,

7.6 Theoretical Prediction of Nuclear Shape
183
and the part which deviates from it and oscillates, i.e., detailed structure;
Etot = ELDM + Eosc .
(7.28)
The oscillating part arises because the distribution of single-particle energy lev-
els deviates from the average level density and is non-uniform reﬂecting the shell
structure.
In the Strutinsky method, the part which depends smoothly on the mass number is
estimated macroscopically based on the liquid-drop model, while the oscillating part
Eosc as the difference between the energy microscopically calculated by the shell
model and the mean energy ˜Esh calculated by introducing the average level density
Eosc = Esh −˜Esh .
(7.29)
If we denote the accurate or shell model level density by g(ε), the average level
density by ˜g(ε), the Fermi energy by λ, and the Fermi energy when the average level
density is used by ˜λ, then
g(ε) =

where f is a Gaussian, whose width γ is of the order of ℏω0, is a candidate of the
method to introduce the average level density. However, one must be sure that the
result does not change when the averaging procedure is repeated [19].
Incidentally, Eq. (7.29) is revised as
Eosc = Esh −˜Esh + Epair −˜Epair
(7.35)
if the pairing energy is taken into account in the BCS method.

184
7
The Shapes of Nuclei
A feature of this method is that the parameter dependence is smaller than the
microscopic method, which we will discuss in the next section, because the parame-
ters are phenomenologically determined based on, e.g., the mass formula. Hence, it
has a high predictive power. As stated at the beginning of this section, it therefore
provides a powerful way to calculate the binding energy and the shape of the ground
state as well as the energy surface for ﬁssion. The same idea has been applied also
to the theoretical study of the structure of metal clusters.
7.6.2
Constrained Hartree–Fock Calculations
The other method is the constrained mean-ﬁeld calculations with the linear or the
quadratic constraints. If one is interested in the quadrupole deformation, the method
of linear constraint performs variational calculations for the effective Hamiltonian
given by
ˆH ′ = ˆH −λQ ˆQ ,
(7.36)
where
ˆQ is the operator of the quadrupole moment
ˆQ =

Lagrange multiplier and is determined such that the expectation value of the quadru-
pole moment becomes equal to the given value Q:
⟨ˆQ⟩= Q ∼AR2
0

9
5π β .
(7.37)
It is therefore a function of the magnitude of the quadrupole moment Q or the
deformationparameterβ,thatis,λQ = λQ(β).9 Inthemethodofquadraticconstraint,
one performs variational calculations to make
E′′ ≡⟨ˆH⟩+ 1
2C(⟨ˆQ⟩−μ)2
(7.38)
minimum. This method corresponds to taking λQ = C(μ −⟨ˆQ⟩) in the linear con-
straint method. If one takes a large enough value for C, E′′ gives the minimum energy
for the state with the deformation μ when μ = ⟨ˆQ⟩.
The single-particle states and the corresponding energies εi(β) are determined
by performing mean-ﬁeld calculations under these constraints. In the Hartree–
Fock+BCS theory, one needs to further determine the u and v factors. There are
practically two ways to that end. The one is a simpliﬁed method, which treats Δ as
a deformation independent parameter. The other is to determine Δ as a function of
9In recent years, the study of unstable nuclei which are far from the β-stability line such as those
in the vicinity of drip lines is extensively going on. One of the main concerns there is to elucidate
the difference of the deformations of the proton and neutron distributions inside a nucleus. In such
studies, one performs calculations by imposing separate constraints on protons and neutrons.

7.6 Theoretical Prediction of Nuclear Shape

β by solving the gap equation (6.134) for each value of the deformation parameter
β, and further to determine the corresponding u and v factors. As the Nilsson levels
show, the distribution of single-particle energy levels strongly depends on β, so that
the latter is, of course, much superior. As we discuss later, it is sometimes crucially
important to follow the latter procedure in order to determine the shape of nuclei. In
that case, one determines the strength of the pairing correlation G in advance by some
way, and assumes that it does not depend on the nuclear deformation. This method
is often called the constant G method. By comparison, the simpliﬁed method which
treats Δ as a deformation independent constant is called the constant Δ method.
Figure7.8 shows the energy surface for 184Hg obtained by the relativistic mean-
ﬁeld (RMF) calculations using the method of quadratic constraint as a function of
the deformation parameter β [20]. The ﬁgure shows that the ground state of 184Hg
is oblate and suggests that there appears prolate states at low excitation energies.
Actually, these results well agree with the experimental data, i.e., that for light Hg
isotopes there appears a rotational band with prolate shape at low excitation ener-
gies above the ground-state rotational band with oblate shape as we mentioned in
connection with Fig.7.3. The RMF calculations were performed by assuming the
NL1 force [21], and the BCS calculations in the constant G method. In the latter, the
magnitude of G has been determined in such a way that the average value of the gap
parameter
¯Δn = 4.8/N 1/3 ,
(7.39)
which has been obtained from the systematic data analyses for many nuclei [22], can
be reproduced for spherical nuclei, instead of using the average value mentioned in
Sect.6.4.4 as it is for the magnitude of G. Using thus obtained Gn and the energies

has been solved for each value of β and the value of the gap parameter Δn(β)
has been determined. The Gp and Δp(β) for protons have also been determined by
using ¯Δp = 4.8/Z1/3 and by the same procedure. Figure7.9 shows thus obtained gap
parameters as functions of the deformation parameter [20]. The ﬁgure clearly shows
that the value of the gap parameter, hence the superﬂuidity of a nucleus, changes
drastically with the deformation of the nucleus. This can be easily expected from
the facts that the value of the gap parameter strongly depends on the level density
in the vicinity of the Fermi surface as Eq. (7.40) shows, and that the distribution of
the nucleon energy levels strongly reﬂects the degree of deformation as the Nilsson
diagram studied in Sect.7.4 shows. As mentioned in Sect.7.3, 184Hg is one of the
exceptional nuclei which are oblate in the ground state. If we use the constant Δ
method, 184Hg is predicted to be prolate. This suggests that the pairing correlation
plays a decisive role in determining the shape of nuclei, and that it is crucially
important to correctly take into account the deformation dependence of the pairing
correlation in order to discuss the shape of nuclei. It will be worth mentioning that
this calculation well reproduces the experimental data of the isotope variation of the
charge radii of Hg isotopes over a wide range of the mass number.

7.7 Column: Superdeformed States

7.7
Column: Superdeformed States
The amount of deformation of rare-earth nuclei and actinides in their ground
states is about δ ∼0.3. By comparison, the deformation of light deformed nuclei
such as 8Be is large.
Today, many states with large deformation have been found in the excitation
energy region in the medium-mass and heavy nuclei as well. They are called
superdeformed states and superdeformed rotational bands built on them, and
have been extensively studied together with high spin states [23].
The ﬁssion isomers mentioned in Sect.2.3.3 are typical examples of superde-
formed states. Figure7.10 shows the distribution of superdeformed bands and
ﬁssion isomers on the nuclear chart.
We learnt in Sect.7.3 that the deformation of nucleus is intimately related to
the shell structure of single-particle levels. In this connection, Fig.7.11 shows
the distribution of single-particle energy levels in the deformed shell model. The
ﬁgure shows that there appears a distinct shell structure, i.e., the degeneracy of
levels, similar to that for δ = 0, when the ratio between the long and short axes
Rz : R⊥becomes, e.g., 2:1. This happens because in that case the ratio of the
magnitudes of the energy quanta in the direction parallel to the symmetry axis
and in the perpendicular direction ℏωz : ℏω⊥becomes 1:2 due to the consistency
condition between the potential for nucleons and the nucleon density. In this
case, the deformation δ(SD) of the superdeformed state becomes δ(SD)

Chapter 8
Nuclear Decay and Radioactivity
Abstract Many nuclei with ﬁnite lifetimes are produced by nuclear reactions and/or
nuclear decays, though the number of stable nuclei is limited to less than 300 if we call
those nuclei whose lifetime is longer than or nearly equal to the age of the universe,
i.e., about 13.8 × 109 years, as stable nuclei. Also, all the excited states of nuclei
eventually decay into other nuclei via α or β decay or ﬁssion, or make transitions
to lower energy levels of the same nucleus by emitting γ rays. The decay called
cluster decay or heavy particle decay or cluster radioactivity, where a nucleus decays
by emitting a nucleus heavier than α particle such as 14C, has also been actively
studied since 1980s (see Rose and Jones, Nature, 307: 245 (1984), [1]). In 2000s,
the study of one-proton and two-proton radioactivities of proton-rich nuclei has also
become active (see Blank and Borge, Prog Part Nucl Phys, 60: 403 (2008); Blank
and Płoszajczak Rep Prog Phys, 71: 046301 (2008), [2]). In this chapter we learn the
α-decay and electromagnetic transitions among the decay of nuclei and radioactivity.
We also brieﬂy discuss recent developments concerning ﬁssion.

in the decay. The nucleus before and after the decay is called the parent and the
daughter nucleus, respectively. 210Po and 206Pb are the parent and daughter nuclei,
respectively, in the decay of 210Po. Both of the states of the parent nucleus prior to
the decay and of the daughter nucleus after the decay are not necessarily the ground
states, and are also not necessarily unique. The decay of 210Po mentioned above
represents the decay of the ground state of 210Po. The half-life of this state is 138.38

days, and the decay occurs to the ground state of 206Pb (0+
g.s.) with probability of
more than 99% and the remaining part decays to the ﬁrst excited state (2+
1 state) of
206Pb. In the case of the α-decay of the ground state of 237Np, the branching ratios
to many different states of the daughter nucleus are nearly equal and the ﬁnal states
diverge.
The amount of energy given by
Qα = B(A −4, Z −2) + B(4, 2) −B(A, Z)
(8.3)
is released in the decay from the ground state of the parent nucleus to the ground
state of the daughter nucleus. Qα is called the Q-value of the α-decay between the
ground states.
The α-decay takes place only when Qα is positive. Using Eq.(8.3), the condition
can be approximately represented as B
A < B(4,2)
4
−A d
dA( B
A). Figure2.6 suggests that
d
dA( B
A) is about −7.5×10−3 MeV. On the other hand, the binding energy of α particle
is 28.3MeV. Hence the condition for the α-decay to occur becomes
B
A < 7.08 + 7.5 × 10−3A MeV .
(8.4)
By adding the right-hand side of Eq.(8.4) to Fig.2.6, we ﬁnd that the Q-value of
the α-decay gets positive, and hence the nucleus becomes in principle unstable with
respect to α-decay, when the mass number exceeds about 150.
8.1.1
Decay Width
There exist various theoretical methods to estimate the α-decay width. Here, we
introduce some of them.1
8.1.1.1
The Method to Obtain the Resonance Formula from the Pole of
the S-Matrix
One of the simple methods is the potential model. In this method, one considers the
α-decay to be the process that a metastable state in a potential ﬁeld VDα, which we
write simply as V in the following, of the daughter nucleus for the α particle decays
with time by a quantum tunneling. The metastable state corresponds to the state of the
parent nucleus. V consists of the nuclear and Coulomb potentials2 and will behave as
shown in Fig.8.1. Figure8.2 is its simpliﬁcation. The abscissa r denotes the distance
1As a related topic, the study of resonance states by using the so-called complex scaling method is
actively going on [3]. It is related also to the study of unstable nuclei.
2Here, we consider the decay of the s-wave.

between the centers of the α particle and the daughter nucleus. For simplicity, we
assumed that the daughter nucleus is spherical and correspondingly that V is a central
potential.
The information on the metastable state can be obtained by studying the pole of the
S-matrix for the scattering if one takes the view that the α-decay is the inverse process
of the resonance scattering between the α particle and the daughter nucleus by the
potential V . Although numerical calculations are needed in general to that end, one
can derive formulae to determine the energy E, the width Γ of the metastable state
and hence the lifetime of the α-decay τ = ℏ/Γ with intuitive physical understanding
if one uses a semi-classical theory. In that connection, Fig.8.1 shows the position of
the metastable state, the Q-value of the α-decay (E = Qα) and the three classical
turning points r1, r2, r3 where the potential energy coincides with the Q-value of
the α-decay: V (ri) = E(i = 1, 2, 3). Leaving the details of the derivation of the
formulae to [4–6], here we quote the results:

Nuclear Decay and Radioactivity
μ is the reduced mass for the relative motion between the α particle and the daughter
nucleus. Equation(8.5) is the quantization condition to determine the position E
of the metastable state and E has to agree with the Q value of the α-decay. The
N is a factor related to the quantum tunneling. The resonance position reﬂects the
properties of the potential barrier through the argument of the factor N. However,
one can set argN to be 0 provided the α-decay takes place at an energy well below
the potential barrier. The exponential factor of the second term of Eq.(8.6) is nothing
but the tunneling probability t(WKB) estimated in the WKB approximation. On the
other hand, as the deﬁnition of T, Eq.(8.8), suggests, the factor 1/T in front of the
exponential function is the attempt frequency per unit time with which the α particle
tries to decay.

The potential V (r) is often assumed to be given by

(8.9)
as shown in Fig.8.2 for the discussion of α-decay. ZD and Zα are the atomic numbers
of the daughter nucleus and the α particle, respectively. In the following, we call
the model which assumes Eq.(8.9) the Gamow model. Since the condition for the
applicability of the WKB approximation is not satisﬁed in this case, one cannot
use Eq.(8.6) for the estimate of the decay width as we learn later (see Eqs.(8.13)–
(8.17)). However, it is useful for various discussions to evaluate the exponential factor
t(WKB) = exp(−2
	 r1
r2 κ(r)dr) for this case by denoting r2 and r1 as R and re, where
re is the external classical turning point of the tunneling region. With the substitution

where k is the wave number in the asymptotic region. The FG is called the Gamow
factor, and plays the principal role in governing the probability of quantum tunneling
when the decay energy is small. The contribution of the second factor e4√2ηkR is much
smaller than that of the Gamow factor. However, it cannot be ignored or set equal to
1 for the α-decay of heavy nuclei in order to keep the quantitative accuracy. In fact,
it is larger than the pre-exponential factor which will be deﬁned later.
8.1.1.3
Direct Method Based on the Gamow Model
In the case of the Gamow model, the wave functions are given by the spherical
Bessel functions of the ﬁrst kind in the potential region and by the Coulomb wave
functions in the external region. Hence one can derive the formulae for the decay
width by using them and the asymptotic form of the Coulomb wave function G0 [7].
Leaving the derivation to AppendixA.8, here we quote the result for the case when
E ≪VCB. Letting T = 2R/v′, where v′ = ℏK/μ is the speed of the α particle inside
the potential well, i.e., at r < rB, we have

8.1.1.4
Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory Based on the Gamow
Model: Two-Potential Approach
The two-potential approach [8] is also often used for the calculation of the α-decay
width. In this method, one introduces the potential V1(r), which has an inﬁnitely thick
potential barrier, i.e., V1(r) = −V0 for r < R and V1(r) = VCB for r ≥R, and the
potential V2(r), which has only the Coulomb potential, i.e., V2(r) = VC(r) = ZDZαe2
r
.
The Gamow potential can be decomposed as

V (r) =

V1(r) for r < R
V2(r) for r ≥R ,
(8.18)
by using these potentials. The α-decay width can be obtained by calculating the
transition probability from a bound state φn(r) with energy En in the potential V1(r)
to a continuum state φE(r) with energy E close to En in the potential V2(r). Since the
perturbation Hamiltonian is V (r) −V1(r), the transition probability per unit time is
given by

8.1.1.5
Comparison of Three Methods
The formulae for the decay width in the three methods discussed in Sects.8.1.1.1,
8.1.1.3 and 8.1.1.4 contain the Gamow factor in common. However, the pre-
exponential factor depends on the way of derivation of the formulae in each method.
The formulae introduced in Sect.8.1.1.1 are superior in the sense that they can
be applied to smooth realistic potentials, since they have been derived based on the
WKB approximation. However, one has to be careful when they are applied to the
Gamow model as they are, and when the tunneling probability t(WKB) in Eq.(8.6) is
replaced by the Gamow factor e−2πη or by the formula multiplied with the correction
factor Eq.(8.11). Since the discussions in both Sect.8.1.1.3 and 8.1.1.4 are based on
the Gamow model, their formulae must yield the correct result within the Gamow
model, and should in principle give the same decay width.
As an example, let us consider the α-decay of 210Po. As we discuss in Sect.A.8,
there exists an ambiguity for the potential describing the α-decay, and there are
3See [8] for the details of the derivation and physical interpretation. See also [9].

8.1 Alpha Decay

various potentials ranging from a shallow to a deep potentials.4 Here, we assume
that the wave function of the relative motion between the daughter nucleus and the
α particle has 11 nodes by considering the Pauli exclusion principle. In this case, the
potential becomes a deep potential, and V0 = 108MeV, R = 7.92fm as we show in
Sect.A.8. VCB is about 30MeV, while Q-value is 5.4MeV. Hence it holds that
V0 ≫VCB ≫Eα .
(8.24)
In this case, the pre-exponential factor ℏk1
μ D2 in Eq.(8.20) approximately becomes
1
T 4 kα
K ( re
R )1/2. The result of Sect.8.1.1.3 given by Eqs.(8.13), (8.15), and (8.20) in
Sect.8.1.1.4 thus become practically equivalent for the model which assumes a deep
potential for the potential between the daughter nucleus and the α particle.5
4Let us take a view of cluster model that a nucleus consists of two constituent clusters A and B. In
the case of α-decay, the nucleus corresponds to the parent nucleus, and the clusters A and B to the
daughter nucleus and the emitted α particle, respectively. Accordingly, we ﬁrst represent the total
wave function as the product of the intrinsic wave functions of the clusters A and B and the wave
function for their relative motion. We then antisymmetrize with respect to the whole nucleons. This
is called the resonating group method (RGM). If we represent the intrinsic wave functions of two
clusters in the harmonic oscillator model with the same oscillator parameter, then there exist in
general special states called either the Pauli forbidden states or the redundant states for the wave
function of the relative motion because of the constraint that the total wave function has to be
antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two nucleons. They are the states, for which
the total wave function vanishes as the result of antisymmetrization. Consequently, there appears
ambiguityinthewavefunctionoftherelativemotionconcerningtheadmixtureofthePauliforbidden
states, and it turns out that there exist several equivalent wave functions with different number of
nodes, which we denote by nr = 0, 1, . . . by excluding the node at the origin. Correspondingly,
there appears an ambiguity for the potential describing the relative motion ranging from shallow to
deep potentials. For example, if we represent 8Be as the product of two α particles and their relative
motion, then the 0s and 1s states are the Pauli forbidden states for the relative motion with angular
momentum 0. By counting the quantum number in the harmonic oscillator shell model, one can
write the condition for the Pauli forbidden states as
2nr + ℓ< N(SM)
C
−N(SM)
A
−N(SM)
B
,
(8.23)
when the angular momentum of the relative motion is ℓ. Here, N(SM)
C
, N(SM)
A
and N(SM)
B
are the total
quantum number of the whole nucleus (C) and of the constituent clusters (A) and (B) when they
are represented by the harmonic oscillator shell model. For example, in the case of α–α scattering
or in the case of the α-decay of 8Be, N(SM)
A
= N(SM)
B
= 0, N(SM)
C
= 4. Equation(8.23) is called
the Wildermuth condition. In the case of the α-decay of 210Po, the right-hand side of Eq.(8.23) is
(5 + 6) × 2, so that the states with nr = 11 and/or larger nr are the allowed states. Incidentally,
the existence of the Pauli forbidden states is also the origin of the repulsive core in the potential
between complex nuclei. In the α–α scattering, the 0s and 1s states are the redundant states for
ℓ= 0 and the 0d state is the redundant state for ℓ= 2. Hence there exists repulsive core in the
potential for these partial waves. On the other hand, there exists no redundant state for ℓ= 4 and
higher partial waves, so that there is no repulsive core in the potential for those high partial waves.
5Various methods to calculate the decay width have been numerically compared for the proton
decay [10].

8.1.1.6
Preformation Factor—R-Matrix Theory
All the three methods so far discussed presume that the α particle with the same
structure as that of the α particle in nature exists inside the parent nucleus in advance
of the α-decay. Let us call such a point of view the potential model. On the other
hand, one can make a detailed description of the state of the parent nucleus using the
wave functions of nucleons based on, e.g., the shell model or the cluster model. In
such calculations the α particle is not presumed to exist in advance inside the nucleus
with the same structure as that in nature. For example, a simple shell model is based
on the thought that each nucleon inside a nucleus moves independently from each
other in the mean ﬁeld except for the constraint due to the Pauli exclusion principle.
In order to evaluate the α-decay width based on the study of nuclear structure by a
many-body theory such as the shell model, it is necessary to estimate the formation
probability of α particle inside the nucleus prior to the decay. The formalism based
on the R-matrix theory6 is one of the representatives of such approaches which takes
into account the preformation probability, where the decay width is given by the
following formulae:
Γ = 2krcγ 2
L (rc)vL(rc) = 2PL(rc)γ 2

The FL and GL are the Coulomb wave functions. rc is chosen such that the effect
of short-range force between the daughter nucleus and the emitted particle, i.e., the
α particle in the case of alpha decay, is absent in the region r > rc, and is called
the channel radius. vL(rc) is called the penetration factor, where the index L shows
that the decay takes place for the partial wave L.7,8 The ψP is the wave function
of the parent nucleus, and φD, φα are the intrinsic wave functions of the daughter
nucleus and the α particle, respectively. They are determined based on appropriate
6The R-matrix theory is a theory to describe resonances in nuclear reactions. It describes the reaction
by dividing the space into the internal region and the external region, i.e., the asymptotic region
where the nuclear force between the emitted nucleus and the remaining nucleus can be ignored. See
[11–15].
7As the asymptotic formula GL + iFL ∼exp[i(ρ −η ln(2ρ) −Lπ/2 + σL)], where ρ = kr and σL
being the Coulomb phase shift, indicates, the wave function which becomes the outgoing wave of
unit magnitude is given by ψL(r) = FL(r) + iGL(r) in the region r ≥rc for the Gamow model.
Hence the vL(rc) ≡

L(rc) gives the magnitude of the penetration probability from rc to the
outside of the potential barrier.

model are related as t(D)

many-body theories such as the shell model, cluster model or mean-ﬁeld theory. The
lower index int, ˆr of Eq.(8.28) means to integrate over the intrinsic coordinates and
the angular coordinates of the relative motion. The YL(r)/r is therefore the radial
wave function of the relative motion between the daughter nucleus and the α particle.
γ 2
L (r) has the dimension of energy and called the reduced width. It gives a measure of
formation probability of the α particle at the surface (r = rc) of the parent nucleus.

parent nucleus has such a structure that an α particle is clusterized and the radial
wave function of the relative motion YL(r) = YL(r)/r distributes uniformly in the
region 0 ≤r ≤rc. It is called the Wigner limit [16].9 θ2 is the reduced width in units
of the Wigner limit.

by writing the penetration probability as t, which is tentatively identiﬁed with PL(rc).
fP ∝θ2 represents the probability that the α particle exists inside the parent nucleus
in advance of the decay. Let us therefore refer to it as the preformation factor.
The value of θ2 provides important information on the extent of clusterization in
light nuclei [18]. A large value of the reduced width for the α-decay corresponds to a
large preformation factor of the α particle, and suggests that the picture of the alpha
cluster structure holds. The preformation factor is ignored in some analyses of the
α-decay. In that case, the effect of the preformation factor is effectively incorporated
in the parameters such as the depth V0 and the range parameter R of the potential.10
Reference [20] is an example of the calculation of θ2 based on the shell model.
9See [17] for the connection to the Teichmann–Wigner sum rule.
10Here, we quote [19] as references for the analysis of α-decay.

Nuclear Decay and Radioactivity
Incidentally, for heavy particle decay such as the 14C emission, the possibility that
the species of the emitted particle and its structure change on the way of decay due
to the channel coupling effects has also been discussed.
8.1.2
The Geiger–Nuttal Rule
The α-decay width strongly depends on the Q-value of the decay and the atomic
number of the parent or daughter nuclei through the tunneling probability. Their
principal effects are expressed by the Gamow factor. Let us therefore express the
decay width, more precisely, the decay rate per unit time as
Γ
ℏ= Ae−2πη
(8.32)
by separating out the Gamow factor. Taking the logarithm of both sides and using
η ≡ZDZαe2/ℏv, we obtain

(8.34)
The factor A does not depend so much on the decaying system as long as we
consider nuclei in a region of similar mass number. Hence Eq.(8.33) suggests that
the experimental data distribute almost along a straight line if we plot them by taking
log10 Γ/ℏas the ordinate and ZDE−1/2
α
as the abscissa [12, 21]. This property is
called the Geiger–Nuttal rule.
Incidentally, detailed information can be obtained from the analysis of the factor
A, since it contains the information on the system such as the potential and the
preformation factor.
8.2
Fission
In Chap.2 we studied ﬁssion somewhat in detail with respect to nuclear instability.
Here, we brieﬂy discuss recent developments of the study of ﬁssion. As shown
in Fig.2.19 in a simpliﬁed fashion, ﬁssion is, in a general term, one of the decay
processes of a metastable state, and occurs by quantum tunneling if the temperature
of the system is 0 or low, while occurs thermally, i.e., by thermal hopping, if the
temperature becomes sufﬁciently high. Figure8.3 schematically shows this situation.
The critical temperature TC which divides the quantum decay and the thermal decay
is given by

width of a metastable state
TC ∼ℏΩ
2π ,
(8.35)
if we denote the curvature of the potential barrier by ℏΩ (Here, we consider in terms
of the corresponding energy) [22, 23]. If we take a simple view of a one-dimensional
process and express the curvature of the potential, in which the metastable state is
made, around the potential minimum by ℏΩ0, then the decay width, more precisely,
the number of decay per unit time is given by

1+exp( 2π
ℏΩ Vf)
for T < TC; Quantum decay
Ω0
2π e−Vf /T
for T ≥TC; Thermal decay.
(8.36)
In each equation, the ﬁrst factor Ω0
2π represents the frequency of the metastable state to
attempt decay and the second factor the success probability. Vf , which corresponds
to Ef in Sect.2.3.4, is the height of the ﬁssion barrier. We used the formula of the
uniform approximation for the tunneling probability and approximated the potential
barrier by a quadratic function. e−Vf /T is a characteristic factor for thermal decay,
and is called the Arrhenius factor.
The spontaneous ﬁssion is an example of the decay by quantum tunneling. A
characteristic is that it is a quantum tunneling in a multi-dimensional space. Many
experimental data such as those of the mass and energy distributions of the ﬁssion
fragments have been accumulated. On the other hand, detailed theoretical calcula-
tions of the potential energy in the multi-dimensional space, where the mass ratio
and the deformation parameters of the ﬁssion fragments are variables, have been per-
formed by using, e.g., the macroscopic–microscopic method, and the search for the
decay path and the calculation of the ﬁssion lifetime with, e.g., the multi-dimensional
escape path method [24] have been developed [25, 26].11
11Not necessarily limited to the spontaneous ﬁssion, it has been experimentally reported that there
are cases where there exist multiple decay paths with different barrier heights for the ﬁssion of the
same nucleus. They are called bimodal ﬁssion. The bimodal ﬁssion appears as the coexistence of the
symmetric and asymmetric ﬁssion for, e.g., 226Ra(3He,df). On the other hand, both are symmetric
ﬁssion, but differ in the width of the mass distribution and the distribution of the kinetic energy of
ﬁssion fragments in the case of the spontaneous ﬁssion of some of the actinides with large mass
number such as 258Fm.

Nuclear Decay and Radioactivity
The induced ﬁssion corresponds to the thermal decay if the excitation energy is
high as it is the case for the ﬁssion induced by heavy-ion collisions. The formula
for the thermal decay given by the lower line of Eq.(8.36) is known as the formula
of the transition state theory by Bohr and Wheeler [27]. The Kramers formula [28]

is also often used as the basic formula for the decay width of the thermal ﬁssion
in calculating the competition between ﬁssion and the emission of particles such as
neutrons by viewing the ﬁssion as a kind of Brownian motion [29, 30] in the external
ﬁeld and hence by formulating it in terms of the Fokker–Planck equation in the phase
space. γ is the friction or viscosity coefﬁcient in the Fokker–Planck equation. K is
the factor which takes into account the effect of friction on the decay rate and is
called the Kramers factor.12
The studies of the reaction mechanism of heavy-ion reactions and of various
physical quantities governing the collision have signiﬁcantly advanced since 1970s.
In this procedure, various concepts have been introduced. They are, e.g., the complete
fusion reaction, where the colliding nuclei completely fuse and decay after a long
time, and the quasi-ﬁssion, which resembles the complete fusion concerning the
mass distribution of the reaction products, but differs in the angular distribution and
the deep inelastic collision (DIC), which is supposed to have a short reaction time
because of the feature that the masses of the reaction products stay near the masses of
the projectile and the target nuclei even though a large energy loss from the relative
motion is involved. Many experimental data have been accumulated in these studies
concerning the mass and kinetic energy distributions of the reaction products such
as the ﬁssion fragments, and the number of emitted neutrons associated with ﬁssion.
The theoretical approach which follows the time evolution of the system based on
the Langevin equation by simulating the reaction as a random walk (or stochastic
process, or drunker’s walk or Wiener process) in a multi-dimensional space has been
developed as a powerful method to analyze these data by paying attention to the
dissipation and associated ﬂuctuation properties [35] (see also [36]).
12There appears in addition a multiplicative correction factor which takes into account the quantum
ﬂuctuation around the classical path if we relate the decay width to the imaginary part of the
Helmholtz free energy [31] and evaluate the partition function by using the path integral method
[32–34].

8.3 Electromagnetic Transitions

8.3
Electromagnetic Transitions
A nucleus in the ground state makes transitions to excited states by absorbing photon,
while a nucleus in an excited state makes transition to the ground state or to lower
excited states by emitting photon. One can extract much information on the structure
of the nucleus such as the excitation energy, the spin and parity of each energy
level, the nuclear shape and the collectivity of each excitation motion through these
transitions.
8.3.1
Multipole Transition, Reduced Transition Probability
The probability of the electromagnetic transition can be given to a good accuracy by
the Fermi golden rule in the ﬁrst order perturbation theory,
Tﬁ= 2π
ℏ|⟨f | ˆHint|i⟩|2g(Ef ) .
(8.39)
ˆHint is the interaction between the nucleus and the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and is given
by Eq.(A.173) as will be described in AppendixA.9. If we denote the initial and the
ﬁnal states of the nucleus by |ψi⟩and |ψf ⟩, respectively, and express the state of the
radiation ﬁeld in the occupation number representation (see AppendixA.9.3), then
the change of the state can be schematically written as
|i⟩= |ψi⟩| · · · nλ · · · ⟩→

|f ⟩= |ψf ⟩| · · · nλ −1 · · · ⟩for absorption,
|f ⟩= |ψf ⟩| · · · nλ + 1 · · · ⟩for emission.
(8.40)
Also, it holds that ℏkc = |Ef −Ei| because of the energy conservation if we denote
the wave length of the photon by λ = 2π/k, and the energy of the initial and ﬁnal
states of the nucleus by Ei and Ef , respectively.
g(Ef ) is the number of ﬁnal states of the radiation ﬁeld per unit energy. If we
consider the magnetic radiation as an example, we have
0 = jI(knR) ∼
1
knR sin

knR −π


(8.41)
from the boundary condition given by Eq.(A.167). Here, we considered R →∞.
Hence it follows that
knR = π
2 I + nπ,
n = 0, ±1, ±2, · · · .
(8.42)

Using the explicit expressions of the vector ﬁelds, Eqs.(A.164) and (A.165), the
expression of the normalization constant Eq.(A.169), and the formula for the level
density Eq.(8.43), we can write the transition probability per unit time by emitting
one photon of the (λ, k, I, M) type as

One usually does not distinguish the difference of the orientation of the angular

General Consideration of the Selection Rule and the
Magnitude
If one denotes the angular momentum and parity of the initial and ﬁnal states by
Ii, Πi and If , Πf , then the selection rules,
|Ii −If | ≤I ≤Ii + If ,
ΠiΠλIΠf = 1 ,
(8.56)
hold due to the structure of the transition matrices ⟨If Mf | ˆQIM|IiMi⟩, ⟨If Mf | ˆMIM|IiMi⟩.
ΠλI is the parity of the multipole radiation, and is given by
ΠEI = (−1)I,
ΠMI = (−1)I+1 ,
(8.57)
because the interaction with the radiation ﬁeld is given by ˆHint ∝A · j.

Single-Particle Model Estimate: Weisskopf Units and
Experimental Values
The electromagnetic transitions give information on the lifetime of the excited states
and the strength of the photo-absorption as the inverse process. They provide infor-
mation also on the nuclear structure such as the nuclear shape, and also on the motion
of nucleons inside a nucleus, especially on collective motions. In this connection, it
is convenient to have an estimate of the value for the case when the single-particle
model holds as a standard value to be compared.
As an example, let us consider the electric transition probability of an odd nucleus.

Table8.2 compares the experimental values of the quadrupole transition proba-
bility from the ﬁrst excited state to the ground state for several doubly magic ±1
nuclei with the single particle estimate given by Eq.(8.61). In the latter, we supposed
the conﬁgurations for the valence nucleon in the initial and ﬁnal states to be those
given in the second and third columns, respectively, from the experimentally known
spin and parity and the shell model. The last column is the effective charge which
is required to reproduce the experimental value with the single-particle model. The
table shows that the single-particle model well reproduces the experimental value.
However, a large effective charge is needed for Bi.
On the other hand, Fig.8.4 shows the experimental values of the deformation
parameter β, which have been deduced from the experimental values of the quadru-
pole transition probability B(E2) from the ground state to the ﬁrst excited 2+ state
based on the collective model (Eq.(8.76), which will be discussed later), in the ratio
to the estimate of the single-particle model βsp for many even–even nuclei in the
wide range of the atomic number [38]. The equivalent radius has been assumed to be
R0 = 1.2A1/3 fm in estimating β. Also, the formula βsp = 1.59/Z, which is obtained
by replacing B(E2) in Eq.(8.76) with the single-particle estimate Eq.(8.67), was used
for βsp. In contrast to the case for doubly magic±1 nuclei shown in Table8.2, the
experimental values for the nuclei far from the magic numbers signiﬁcantly deviate
from the estimate of the single-particle model. The experimental values are much
more enhanced than the estimates of the single-particle model especially for the
nuclei in the region of mass number between 150 and 200 such as rare-earth nuclei,
and for the nuclei whose atomic number exceeds 86 such as Rn, U and Th.

Connection Between Electromagnetic Transitions and
the Shapes and Collective Motions of Nuclei
The nuclei with large deformation, i.e., with large quadrupole transition probability,
which have been pointed out regarding Fig.8.4, well coincide with those nuclei
which are expected to be statically deformed in their ground state and to be easily
excited to the rotational excited states from the energy level structure in the vicinity
of the ground state. In addition, the experimental values of the quadrupole transition
probability systematically show signiﬁcantly larger values than the prediction of the
single-particle model for the nuclei whose mass number is around 120 such as Cd
isotopes with the atomic number 48 as well. The structure of the energy spectrum
suggests that they are the nuclei which are expected to be easily excited to the
vibrational excited states of the quadrupole type, although they are spherical in the
ground state. These nuclei can be more naturally described in the collective model
than in the single-particle model.
Here, we mention some basic results concerning the collective model, i.e., the
geometrical collective model, which is often called the Bohr–Mottelson model.
The geometrical collective model uses the deformation parameters αλμ introduced
by Eq.(7.2) as dynamical variables. Correspondingly, the density distribution of
protons is assumed to be given by

16The values of ℏΩ2 and B2 can be theoretically estimated in the liquid-drop model which views
the nucleus as an irrotational incompressible ﬂuid. However, the resulting values are quantitatively
in signiﬁcant disagreement with the experimental data. Instead, more reliable estimates can be
obtained phenomenologically from the experimental values of the excitation energy of the ﬁrst

Equation(8.76) shows that the magnitude of B(E2) increases proportionally to the

17One can estimate the deformation parameter β, more precisely βR2
0, from the experimental data of
B(E2) by using Eq.(8.76). However, B(E2) gives only the magnitude of the deformation parameter.
One of the standard methods to determine the sign is to use the so-called reorientation effect
in the Coulomb excitation. Recently, it has been attempted to precisely determine the deformation
including the sign through the analyses of heavy-ion fusion reactions at energies below the Coulomb
barrier [40–45].
18The transition from high excited states to lower states within a nucleus can take place not only
by the electromagnetic transition which emits a photon, but by ejecting an electron with the energy
released in the decay. The latter process is called the internal conversion (see [46] for details).
Hence the total transition probability is given by
w = wγ + we = (1 + α)wγ ,
(8.77)
α ≡we/wγ ,
(8.78)
if we denote the transition probability by emitting photon by wγ , and the transition probability
by the internal conversion process by we. α is called the internal conversion coefﬁcient. If the
transition energy is large to some extent, then α is small, so that one can ignore the contribution of
the internal conversion. On the other hand, the internal conversion becomes the main decay process
if the excitation energy of the ﬁrst excited 2+
1 state is small as in the case of 238
92 U, where it is about
45keV. Equation(8.76) holds in this case as well. However, care should be taken when one tries to
estimate the magnitude of β from the lifetime of the 2+
1 state.

ties between different states within a rotational band are related to each other through
the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcients as is given by Eq.(8.75) in the case of ideal rota-
tional motion, where the deformation does not change with the angular momentum,
namely, where the intrinsic state does not change in the ground and excited states.19

The prediction of the liquid-drop model Eq.(8.80) has a different mass number dependence from
that of the experimental data given by Eq.(8.79). One reason of the discrepancy is the quantum
mechanical effect, which plays important roles in nuclear physics. It is necessary to treat nucleus as
a quantum liquid in order to handle nucleus in the liquid-drop model in a quantitatively proper way.
For example, the classical liquid-drop model evaluates the potential energy by taking into account
the effect of deformation only in the ordinary space in deriving the Hamiltonian for collective
motions. Accurately, however, one needs to consider the effects of deformation in the momentum
space as well as suggested by the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. This effect shows
up, for example, in the vibrational excited states such as the giant quadrupole resonance (GQR)
[39]. The discrepancy between the experimental data and the prediction of the liquid-drop model
appears also regarding the moment of inertia of deformed nuclei.

Chapter 9
Synthesis of Elements
Abstract It is a long-standing intriguing problem to explore the synthesis of
elements, and extensive studies are going on (See Clayton (Principles of Stellar
Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1968,
[1]), Rolfs and Rodney (Cauldrons in the Cosmos, The University of Chicago Press,
Chicago, 1988, [2]), Thompson and Nunes (Nuclear Reactions for Astrophysics:
Principles, Calculation and Applications of Low-Energy Reactions, Cambridge Uni-
versity Press, Cambridge, 2009, [3]), VHS Element Genesis—Solving the Mystery,
2001, [4]). Roughly speaking, the synthesis of elements can be divided into the pri-
mordial nucleosynthesis, which is also called the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and the
stellar nucleosynthesis. The light elements such as deuterons, He and Li have been
synthesized by nuclear reactions within 3–15min after the Big Bang. This is the Big
Bang nucleosynthesis. It terminates at the elements of mass number 7, since there
is no stable nucleus of mass number 8. Stars started to be formed about one billion
years later. Then, thermal nuclear reactions took place inside stars, and nuclei up to
Fe, which has the largest binding energy per nucleon, have been successively syn-
thesized depending on the mass of each star. (Precisely speaking, the nucleus which
has the largest binding energy per nucleon is 62
28Ni as remarked in Chap.2.) Nuclei
beyond Fe are synthesized either slowly by the neutron capture reactions called slow
process (s-process) inside red giant stars, or synthesized by the explosive astrophys-
ical phenomenon called rapid process (r-process). Nuclei with extremely large mass
number such as U are thought to be synthesized at the supernovae explosion, which
is one of the last stages of stars. In this chapter we learn some basics concerning the
nuclear reactions related to nucleosynthesis (See Clayton (Principles of Stellar Evo-
lution and Nucleosynthesis, 1968, [1]), Rolfs and Rodney (Cauldrons in the Cosmos,
1988, [2]), Thompson and Nunes (Nuclear Reactions for Astrophysics: Principles,
Calculation and Applications of Low-Energy Reactions, Cambridge University
Press, Cambridge, 2009, [3]) for details).

by taking out the trivial exponential factor (Gamow factor) exp(−2πη), where η is
the Sommerfeld parameter. S(E) is called the astrophysical S-factor.
Since the Gamow factor has been taken out, S(E) is expected to vary gently as
a function of energy unless resonance phenomena are involved. The energy of the
Gamow peak (see the next section), which plays a central role in nuclear reactions
in stars, is much lower than the lowest energy where experiments can be performed
in many cases. The cross section at the Gamow peak is therefore often estimated
by extrapolating the experimental data at high energies, where experiments can be
performed. The gentle energy dependence of S(E) is convenient in this connection,
too.
Figure9.1 shows the experimental data of S(E) factor for the 3He(3He,2p)4He
reaction. It is remarkable that the experiments have been done down to energies
as low as the Gamow peak in the Sun for this reaction. The ﬁgure shows that the
experimental value of S(E) is systematically larger than the value obtained by the
extrapolation of high energy data. This situation is not special to this reaction, but
is common to many other systems so far studied, and the enhancement of the cross

The exponential factor in the integrand of Eq. (9.5) is sharply peaked at an energy

Neutron Capture Cross Section
We show in this section that the capture cross section of s-wave neutrons, i.e., the
cross section of low-energy reactions such as the reactions by thermal neutrons, is
proportional to 1/v (1/v-law), where v is the velocity of the neutron relative to the
target nucleus, and that the v dependence changes as the energy increases.
To make the argument simple, we approximate the cross section of the capture
reaction by the absorption cross section by a strongly absorbing square well poten-
tial. Furthermore, we represent the strong absorption effect by the incoming wave
boundary condition at the potential surface at r = a. If we express the wave function
of the relative motion as R(r) = u(r)/r, and name the region of r ≤a the region I,
and that of r > a the region II, then
uI(r) = Ae−iKr + BeiKr ,

V0 is the depth of the potential, which is assumed to be a real number.

ary condition. In this case, the continuity conditions of the wave function and of its
derivative at r = a lead to

Synthesis of Heavy Elements: S-Process and R-Process
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, nuclei with large mass number beyond
Fe are believed to be synthesized by either the so-called s-process (slow process) or
by the r-process (rapid process).
In the abundance curve shown in Fig.1.7, the right peak (indicated by “s”) in
each double peaks at A ∼80, 130, and 200 is produced by the s-process. This peak
corresponds to nuclei with a neutron magic number (N = 50, 82, or 126). The left
peak (indicated by “r”) is produced by the r-process.
Figure9.2 conceptually shows the paths of the synthesis of elements by the s- and
r-processes. It shows how heavy nuclei are built up by successive neutron captures,
interspersed with β-decays. While the s-process nucleosynthesis proceeds almost
along the stability line, the r-process nucleosynthesis rapidly proceeds via the region
of neutron-rich unstable nuclei.2 The study of r-process is therefore extensively going
on in these days in connection with the study of unstable nuclei. For the r-process, it
is suggested that the neutron number stays unchanged for a while when it coincides
with one of the magic numbers, and nuclei with various atomic numbers with the
ﬁxed neutron number are synthesized.3
2Large neutron ﬂuxes are expected in supernovae explosions. Consequently, neutron-rich nuclei
are successively synthesized by (n,γ ) reaction. The binding energy of neutron becomes small if
the number of excess neutrons gets too large. The (n,γ ) reaction then becomes balanced with the
inverse (γ ,n) reaction, and the synthesis does not proceed further. Eventually, the unstable neutron-
rich nucleus either proceeds towards stability line via β-decays, or repeats (n,γ ) reactions after
increasing the atomic number via β-decays to synthesize nuclei with still larger proton and neutron
numbers. The r-process path is thus determined.
3The regions where the neutron number does not change for a while in the r-process nucleosynthesis
are called waiting points and the corresponding nuclei are called waiting point nuclei. It is considered
that the peaks on the left side in Fig.1.7 appear reﬂecting the waiting points.

Column: Overview of the Synthesis of Elements
Figure9.3 summarizes the various paths of the synthesis of elements hitherto
described. The rp-process, which has been added in the ﬁgure, is the process,
where proton-rich nuclei with the mass number up to ∼100 are synthesized
by (p,γ ) and (α,p) reactions.4 In addition, there exists the p-process, called
sometimes γ process, where neutron-deﬁcient nuclei with the mass number
larger than that for the nuclei made by the rp-process are synthesized by photo-
disintegration such as (γ ,n), (γ ,p), and (γ, α) reactions [3]. Nucleosynthesis
by neutrinos associated with supernovae explosions is also one of the current
topics [7].
In parallel with the research to uncover the synthesis of elements, various
studies of astrophysical phenomena such as the physics of neutron stars from
the points of view of nuclear physics are very actively ongoing. It forms an
important branch of current nuclear physics.
4Recent research on neutron stars suggests that the rp-process ends at 105
52 Te.

Sommerfeld–Watson Transformation
For high energy scattering, it is more convenient to use the integral representation
of the scattering amplitude instead of the partial wave expansion. The integral repre-
sentation sometimes becomes useful for scattering at low energies as well. Starting
from the integral representation of the scattering amplitude and deriving character-
istic closed form expression through some suitable approximation scheme such as
the stationary phase approximation or the method of steepest descent, one can often

obtain intuitive understanding for complicated patterns appearing in the differential
cross section in terms of, e.g., the interference of various scattering waves or the
caustics such as the rainbow scattering and the glory scattering [2–7].
The transformation from the partial wave sum to the integral representation can
be achieved by using the knowledge of the contour integral in the complex plane.

that the integrand has a pole of order one at each integer value of ℓand that the

of times which the incident particle circulates the target particle. The m = 0 term
governs the scattering at high energies or if the attractive force between the projectile

the scattering at low energies if a strong attractive force is involved [6].

Basics of Semi-classical Theory I: WKB
Approximation
Here, let us ﬁrst study the WKB approximation3 among various semi-classical meth-
ods. The WKB approximation is the method to approximately obtain the solution
of the Schrödinger equation in the limit of taking the Planck constant ℏto be zero.
Physically, it is valid when the change of the potential energy within a wave length
can be ignored compared with the magnitude of the local kinetic energy. Hence, it
can be said to be a short wave length approximation. In this approximation, the wave
function and the phase shift as well as the scattering matrix for scattering problems
are given in terms of the action integrals in classical mechanics.
A.2.1
Wave Function
As an example, let us consider a problem where the potential is given by Vn(r) +
VC(r), the former and the latter being the nuclear and the Coulomb potentials, re-
spectively, and approximately obtain ψℓ(r) when the radial wave function Rℓ(r) of
an eigenstate of energy or the scattering problem with the orbital angular momentum
ℓis expressed as Rℓ(r) ≡ψℓ(r)/r. The ψℓ(r) obeys the following equation:

(A.26)
We introduced the Langer replacement ℓ(ℓ+ 1) →(ℓ+ 1/2)2 ≡λ2 in Eq.(A.26).
In the WKB approximation, we express the wave function in the form of the
product of the amplitude and the phase factor, and write
ψ(r) = A(r)eiS(r)/ℏ.
(A.27)
We leave out the index ℓin Eq.(A.27) and throughout this section. Making the
substitution Eq.(A.27) in Eq.(A.24) and treating A(r), S(r) and V (r) as quantities
independent of ℏand collecting the terms with the same powers of ℏ, we obtain
3Wenzel–Kramers–Brillion approximation. It is also called the JWKB approximation by including
the name of Jefferey.

Equation(A.30) denotes the conservation of the current density. Together with

A ∝

where A+ and A−are constants. In this way, the wave function in the WKB approx-
imation is given by replacing the wave number times displacement in the arguments
of the exponential functions for a free particle with the action integral using the local
wave number. This is a natural consequence, since the WKB approximation is based
on the assumption that the spatial change of momentum is small.
The ℏ2 term in Eq.(A.28) has to be sufﬁciently small compared with the other
terms in order for the WKB approximation to be applicable. Equations(A.31) and
(A.32) lead to

Thus, the condition for the WKB approximation to be valid is that the amount of

energy at that position.

Basics of Semi-Classical Theory II: Method
of Comparison Equation
In this section, we formulate the semi-classical theory, i.e., the WKB method, using
the method of comparison equation, which is different from the standard method
described in Sect.A.2.
A.3.1
Principle of the Method of Comparison Equation
Turning points play important roles in describing the reﬂection of a particle in clas-
sical mechanics. Since the turning points are deﬁned as the points where the energy
of the particle matches the value of the potential energy, namely, as the points where
E = V (r), they become in general complex numbers if the potential is a complex
potential as in the case of scattering by an optical potential. There exist many turning
points in the complex r plane even if V (r) is a real potential. For example, when
the potential between the scattering nuclei has the form shown in Fig.8.1, and when
the scattering energy is slightly above the potential barrier, there appears a turning
point, whose real part is the barrier position, at each side of, i.e., above and below,
the real axis in the complex plane.
Exercise A.1 Let us express the potential near the barrier position rB as V (r) =
VCB −μΩ2(r −rB)2/2 when the potential looks like Fig.8.1. Discuss the change
of the positions of the classical turning points in the complex r plane as the scattering
energy E varies from below to above the barrier height VCB.
We therefore make an analytic continuation of the Schrödinger equation to com-
plex plane and seek the solution of the second order differential equation of a complex
variable r:
 d2
dr2 + χ(r)

ψ(r) = 0 ,
(A.35)
χ(r) = 2μ
ℏ2 (E −V (r)) .
(A.36)
V (r) can have in general both the real and the imaginary parts; V (r) = VR(r) +
iVI(r), where both VR(r) and VI(r) are analytic functions and are real functions
when r is real.
In the method of comparison equation, we introduce another space of a com-
plex number, which we denote by σ, besides the complex r space, and introduce a
subsidiary second order differential equation in that space:
 d2
dσ 2 + Γ (σ)

φ(σ) = 0 ,
(A.37)
which is called the comparison equation.

230
Appendix A: Important Formulae and Their Derivation
The function Γ (σ) is chosen to have the same topological structure as that of
χ(r). In simpler words, it is chosen to have the same number of important zero
points, that is, the same number of turning points. Moreover, it is so chosen that
the exact solutions of Eq.(A.37) are functions whose properties are well known. The
basic idea of the method of comparison equation is to obtain an approximate solution
ψ(r) of the original Eq.(A.35) in terms of the solutions φ(σ) of Eq.(A.37), whose
properties are well known, by introducing suitable comparison equation.
The mapping between the two spaces is made in the following way. We ﬁrst map
the important zeros in ther space onto the zeros in the σ space by one to one mapping,
then deﬁne the mapping between the two spaces so that
dσ
dr =
 χ(r)

(A.38)
Since the integral form of Eq.(A.38) reads
 r
r0
[χ(r)]1/2 dr =
 σ
σ0
[Γ (σ)]1/2 dσ ,
(A.39)
Equation(A.38) means that the mapping is made to conserve the action integral in
two spaces.
One can show that in this case it holds
ψ(r) ≈

in the limit of ℏ→0.
In fact, by changing Eq.(A.40) into an identity equation, and inserting it into
Eq.(A.35), one obtains

Equation(A.41) shows that Eq.(A.37) is obtained in the limit of ℏ→0 if one deﬁnes
the mapping by Eq.(A.38). The error is given by ( dσ
dr )−3/2 f (σ)φ(σ)/ d2φ(σ)
dσ 2 .

A.3.2
Derivation of the WKB Wave Function
As a simple example, let us obtain the wave function at a place far from any classical
turning points. In this case, the Γ can be chosen as
Γ (σ) = 1 .
(A.43)
The solution of the corresponding comparison Eq.(A.37) is given by
φ(σ) = Aeiσ + Be−iσ .
(A.44)
On the other hand, Eq.(A.39) leads to
σ =

χ1/2dr =

k(r)dr .
(A.45)
Since χ(r) = k2(r), we ﬁnally obtain

The right-hand side agrees with Eq.(A.33) obtained in Sect.A.2, and is nothing but
the wave function in the WKB approximation.
Incidentally, the WKB formula for the tunneling probability can be derived by
separately treating the two turning points on both sides of the potential barrier as an
isolated turning point, and using σ as Γ for each region, and connecting the wave
functions on both sides by using the asymptotic form of the Airy function, which
is the corresponding φ. On the other hand, the formula of the barrier transmission
probability in the uniform approximation (2.77) can be obtained by considering the
potential barrier basically as a parabolic barrier and hence by taking Γ = σ 2/4 −ε
and by studying the asymptotic behaviours of the corresponding eigenfunctions φ,
which are the Whittaker functions [9, 10]. The ε is determined so as to conserve the
action integral between the two turning points at the potential barrier in the r and
σ spaces. Also, the S matrix, which is the basis of Eqs.(8.5)–(8.8) can be derived
by mapping the inner region including r3 (see Fig.8.1) by a linear function and the
barrier region by a quadratic function, determining approximate wave function for
each region and by connecting them using their asymptotic forms. In the connection,
it is crucial to use the correct asymptotic forms of the Whittaker and Airy functions
depending on the phase of the arguments.

Glauber Theory
Here, we derive the formulae of the Glauber theory in the optical limit given by
Eqs.(2.34)–(2.37).
The starting point is Eqs.(A.47)–(A.49) of the eikonal approximation. In order to
apply these equations to the nucleon–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus scattering, let us
microscopically represent the scattering potential in terms of the sum of the nuclear
force between individual nucleons vN N(riP −r jT ),
V (R) =

iP, jT
vN N(riP −r jT )
(A.51)
=

drPdrT vN N(rP −rT + R)ρP(rP)ρT (rT ) .
(A.52)
In these equations, R is the coordinate of the relative motion, R ≡RP −RT , between
the centers of mass of the projectile and target nuclei, RP, RT . riP (r jT ) is the
coordinate of the i-th nucleon in the projectile ( j-th nucleon in the target) measured
from the origin of the space ﬁxed coordinate system. rP and rT are the intrinsic
coordinates of the nucleons in the projectile and target nuclei measured from RP and
RT , respectively. ρP(rP) and ρT (rT ) are the nucleon densities of the projectile and
target nuclei at rP and rT , respectively. In transforming from Eqs.(A.51) to (A.52),
we used that the nucleon densities are given by ρP(rP) = 
iP δ(riP −RP −rP),
and ρT (rT ) = 
jT δ(r jT −RT −rT ), like Eq.(5.2). vN N(r) is the nuclear potential

Appendix A: Important Formulae and Their Derivation
233
between two nucleons, which are separated by r. The potential given by Eq.(A.52)
is called the double folding potential, and is often used for the interaction between
two nuclei.
Since the nuclear force is of short range, we approximate it as
vN N(r) = (vRe + ivIm)δ(r).
(A.53)
The imaginary part (ivIm) has been introduced to take into account the other processes
than the elastic scattering. The potential is then given by
V (R) = (vRe + ivIm)

drρP(r −R)ρT (r) .

mass and the wave number in the nucleus–nucleus scattering, respectively.
We next use the Born approximation and the optical theorem in order to relate
the strength of the nuclear force to the total cross section in the nucleon–nucleon
scattering. By applying the formula in the Born approximation,
f (1)(θ) = −1

In order for Eq.(A.58) to agree with Eq.(2.34), it is required that

(A.59)
This is equivalent to the condition (2.37). Equations(2.34)–(2.37) are derived in this
way. Since the proof used the same reaction cross section irrespective of the nucleon
species, it will be adequate to use the average cross section ¯σN N.
A.5
Non-local Potential
A characteristic of nuclear physics is that a non-local potential is often involved.
The Fock potential in the Hartree–Fock approximation for nuclear structure, and the
exchange potentials which appear when one microscopically describes the scattering
between complex nuclei such as the scattering between α particle and nucleus and
betweentwoheavynucleibytakingintoaccountantisymmetrizationamongnucleons
based on, e.g., the resonating group method are typical examples.
On the other hand, one usually assumes a local potential for phenomenological
analyses of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions. In this section, we review some
standardmethodstoconverttheSchrödingerequationinvolvinganon-localpotential,
hence an integro-differential equation, into an equivalent local differential equation,
andinterpretthecharacteristiceffectsduetonon-localityinotherphysicalterms,such
as the effective mass, which are relevant to the description by using local potential,
hence by a local differential equation [1].
A.5.1
Integro-Differential Equation
We consider a one-dimensional problem and represent the local and the non-local
potentials by U and V , respectively. In this case, the wave function obeys the integro-
differential equation:

Equivalent Effective Local Potential: WKB
Approximation
One useful method to study the characteristic physical effects of a non-local potential
is the method based on the WKB approximation. To that end, we ﬁrst rewrite the

term of the non-local potential into

V (x, x′)ψ(x′)dx′ =

V (x, x′)e
i
ℏ(x′−x) ˆpψdx′ ψ(x) .
(A.61)
The subscript ψ of the momentum operator ˆp has been attached in order to indicate
that it operates on the wave function ψ. The essence of the WKB approximation
is to represent the wave function in the form of a plane wave by using the local
momentum. Also, it is based on the assumption that the spatial variation of the wave
number is small. Hence,
ˆpψψ(x) ∼p(x)ψ(x) ,
(A.62)
where p(x) is the local momentum at the position x.
A.5.2.1
WKB Approximation I: Local Momentum Approximation,
Energy Dependent Potential
By applying the approximation (A.62) to Eq.(A.61), one obtains the following equiv-
alent effective local potential:
Ueff(E; x) = U(x) +

(A.65)
Equation(A.65) is an approximate equation which is valid when the contribution
from the non-local potential is small compared with U(x). As these formulae show,
the equivalent effective local potential depends on the energy.
The energy dependence discussed here originates from non-locality. The potential
has in addition another energy dependence due to the polarization or the channel-
coupling effects such as the phonon excitation on the way of collision. The latter is
often called the intrinsic energy dependence in order to distinguish from the energy
dependence due to non-locality [1].

modiﬁed by the non-local potential.

WKB Approximation III: Wigner Transformation
Here we derive an alternative expression of the equivalent local potential based on
the Wigner transformation. Let us ﬁrst rewrite the non-local potential term by using
the Wigner transformation of the non-local potential as

Tensor Algebra
A.6.1
Deﬁnition of Tensor Operators
The tensor property of a physical quantity or an operator represents their transfor-
mation property under a rotation of either the coordinate system or the object and is
a uniﬁed generalization of scalar, vector and tensor by introducing the index named
rank. The tensor property is one of the fundamental properties of each physical quan-
tity like the spatial and/or temporal dimension related to units, and plays an important
role, e.g., in evaluating transition matrices and in deriving selection rules.
4Thanks to the large effective mass and hence the short wave length property, the classical theory
which uses the concept of classical trajectory is useful for heavy-ion collisions, and has been
successfully applied to analysing fusion reactions and deep inelastic collisions involving a huge
amount of energy dissipation from the relative motion to intrinsic motions and the associated
ﬂuctuations [14, 15]. In that connection, it is an interesting question how to incorporate the exchange
effects of nucleons in the classical theory. The semi-classical treatment of a non-local potential has
been discussed also in [16].

Appendix A: Important Formulae and Their Derivation
Let us consider a translation before we discuss a rotation. In that case, there are two
alternative ways. In the one, one keeps the object as it is, and performs a translation
of the coordinate system from the old one K (x, y, z) to a new one K ′(x′, y′, z′).
In the other, one translates the object by keeping the coordinate system as it is. Here,
we take the latter. Let us consider the translation of an object by a. If we express the
wave function before and after the translation as ψ(x) and ψ′(x), respectively, then
ψ′(x) = ψ(x −a)

(A.82)
Equation(A.82) shows that ˆp is the generator of the inﬁnitesimal translation in space.
Equation(A.82) is expressed as
|ψ′⟩= ˆT (a)|ψ⟩,
(A.83)
ˆT (a) ≡e−ia ˆp/ℏ,
(A.84)
in the Dirac notation. ˆT (a) given by Eq.(A.84) is the unitary operator which causes
the translation by a.5 Also, if we deﬁne the operator ˆO′ for an operator ˆO repre-
senting some observable in such a way that the expectation value is conserved under
transformation, namely, by
⟨ψ| ˆO|ψ⟩≡⟨ψ′| ˆO′|ψ′⟩,
(A.85)
then by rewriting the right-hand side of Eq.(A.85) as ⟨ψ′| ˆO′|ψ′⟩= ⟨ψ| ˆT † ˆO′ ˆT |ψ⟩,
we ﬁnd that ˆO′ is given by
ˆO′ = ˆT (a) ˆO ˆT †(a) = ˆT (a) ˆO ˆT −1(a) .
(A.86)
Equation(A.86) shows that the operator is transformed by the same unitary operator
as that for the state vector ψ.
Exercise A.2 Show
ˆx′ ≡ˆT (a)ˆx ˆT †(a) = ˆx −a ,
(A.87)
⟨ψ′|ˆx|ψ′⟩= ⟨ψ|ˆx|ψ⟩+ a ,
(A.88)
by using Eq.(A.84). Equation(A.88) agrees with that |ψ′⟩is the state, where the
object is translated by a.
5It is the operator to cause the translation by −a if one takes the point of view of ﬁxing the object
and transforming the coordinate system.

Analogously, by considering inﬁnitesimal rotations, one can show that the gen-
erators of the inﬁnitesimal rotations are the angular momentum operators ˆJα (α =
x, y, z). For example, the rotation of an object through an angle α about the z-axis
is given by the unitary operator ˆRz = e−iα ˆJz. By extending this result, the unitary
operator for a rotation in the three-dimensional space is in general given either as
ˆR(w) = e−iw·ˆJ
(A.89)
by using the vector w, which speciﬁes the direction and the magnitude of rotation,
or as
ˆR(φ, θ, ψ) = e−iφ ˆJze−iθ ˆJye−iψ ˆJz
(A.90)
by using the Euler angles [17].
(i) First Deﬁnition of a Tensor Operator: When 2k + 1 operators ˆT (k)

under a rotation, ˆT (k) is called an irreducible tensor of rank k, and ˆT (k)
q
the q-
component. The rotation matrix R(k)
q′q(φ, θ, ψ) is deﬁned by
R(k)
q′q(φ, θ, ψ) ≡⟨kq′| ˆR(φ, θ, ψ)|kq⟩.
(A.92)
[N.B.] Equation(A.92) obeys [17]. It is the same as D function in Ref. [18]:
R(k)
q′q(φ, θ, ψ) = (D(k)
q′q(φ, θ, ψ))BS. It is related to the D function in Ref. [19] as
R(k)
q′q(φ, θ, ψ) = (D(k) ∗
q′q (φ, θ, ψ))BM. Since Ref. [20] transforms coordinate system
rather than the object, the sign of the arguments of the D function is inverted:
R(k)
q′q(φ, θ, ψ) = (D(k)
q′q(−φ, −θ, −ψ))RS. In this book, the deﬁnition of D(k)
qq′ follows
Ref. [19].
(ii) Second Deﬁnition of a Tensor Operator: Since the generators of the inﬁni-
tesimal rotations are the angular momentum operators, one can alternatively deﬁne
the irreducible tensor of rank k as the set of operators which satisfy the following
commutation relations:

ˆJz, ˆT (k)

(A.94)
In order to show the equivalence between the two deﬁnitions, we show here that
Eqs.(A.93) and (A.94) can be derived from Eq.(A.91). Let us now assume that ˆR
is the inﬁnitesimal rotation operator (1 −iα ˆJλ). In this case, from the deﬁnition

240
Appendix A: Important Formulae and Their Derivation
Eq.(A.92), we have
R(k)
q′q = ⟨kq′|(1 −iα ˆJλ)|kq⟩= δq′q −iα⟨kq′| ˆJλ|kq⟩.
(A.95)
On the other hand,
ˆR ˆT (k)
q
ˆR−1 = (1 −iα ˆJλ) ˆT (k)
q (1 + iα ˆJλ) .
(A.96)
Hence from Eq.(A.91)

q (1 + iα ˆJλ) =

δq′q −iα⟨kq′| ˆJλ|kq⟩

(A.98)
By putting here ˆJλ = ˆJz and ˆJλ = ˆJ± and noting
⟨kq′| ˆJz|kq⟩= qδq′q ,
⟨k q ± 1| ˆJ±|kq⟩=

(k ∓q)(k ± q + 1) ,
(A.99)
we obtain Eqs.(A.93) and (A.94).

for the q component of a tensor of rank k, T (k)
q . The α and α′ are the quantum numbers
other than the angular momentum to specify states.
Equation(A.102) is called the Wigner–Eckart theorem, and shows that the matrix
element of a tensor operator can factor out the dependence on the z-component of the
angular momentum in terms of the geometrical factor given by the Clebsch–Gordan
coefﬁcient. The factor ⟨αJ∥T (k)∥α′J ′⟩is called the reduced matrix element. The
Wigner–Eckart theorem allows to automatically determine all the matrix elements
based on the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcient if the reduced matrix element is once deter-
mined by calculating the matrix element for one combination of M′, q, M for which
the Clebsch–Gordan coefﬁcient is ﬁnite.
Especially when T is 1 or the angular momentum operators or the spherical
harmonics, the reduced matrix elements are given by

the right-hand side, but includes it in the factor ⟨αJ∥T ∥α′ J ′⟩.

Equation(A.106) is called the projection theorem or the Landé formula, and is use-
ful, e.g., in deriving the Schmidt values for the magnetic dipole moment given in
Sect.5.4.1.
A.6.5
Relation Between the Scalar Product and the Tensor
Product of Rank 0
One can deﬁne a combined tensor operator of two tensor operators by taking an
appropriate sum of the product of their components using the Clebsch–Gordan
coefﬁcients as follows

by
S ≡(T (k) · U (k)) ≡

q

S = (V(1) · W(1)) = VxWx + VyWy + VzWz .

that the multipole moment operator ˆQintr.

corresponding operator ˆQlab.

In the following, we consider the quadrupole moment. Since the quadrupole mo-
ment is deﬁned by ⟨ΨI M=I K| ˆQlab.
λ=2,μ=0|ΨI M=I K⟩, one can easily show that the second
and third terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(A.112) are zero for axial-symmetrically
deformed even–even nuclei7 and for odd nuclei in the strong coupling state with
I = K = 1/2 or K ≥3/2 by noting the properties of the D function, |ν| ≤2, the
addition rule of two angular momenta and the fact that K = 0, 2, 4 · · · for collective
motions of axial-symmetrically deformed even–even nuclei. In addition, the fourth
and ﬁrst terms become equal. It therefore follows

One can determine the energy E, i.e., the Q-value for the α-decay, and the decay
width Γ by using Eqs.(A.117) and (A.120) if the depth of the potential V0 and the
range of the nuclear force R are known in advance. Conversely, one can determine
the depth of the potential V0 and the range of the nuclear force R for the α-decay from
the Q-value and the decay width using Eqs.(A.117) and (A.120) if they are known
experimentally. However, as discussed in Sect.8.1.1, there remains an ambiguity of
potential because of the presence of Pauli forbidden states, in other words, redundant
states. In order to remove the ambiguity, one needs to specify the number of nodes in
the wave function for the relative motion. As one example of such analyses, TableA.1

shows the results of the analysis to determine the potential for the α-decay from the
ground state of 210Po to the ground state of 206Pb given by Eq.(8.1) by using the
experimental data for the Q-value and the decay width. As the Table shows, there
exist a wide range of potentials from shallow to deep ones depending on the number
of nodes in the radial wave function of the relative motion. The number of nodes is
11 for the α-decay from the ground state of 210Po to the ground state of 206Pb if we
count the quantum number in the harmonic oscillator shell model.

Basics of Electromagnetic Transitions
A.9.1
Hamiltonian of the Total System
To discuss the electromagnetic transitions of a nucleus, it is necessary to treat the
combined system consisting of the nucleus, i.e., a many-body system of nucleons,
and the electromagnetic ﬁelds. The Hamiltonian of the total system is given by
ˆHtot = ˆHnucl + ˆHﬁeld + ˆHint .
(A.128)
ˆHnucl is the Hamiltonian of an isolated nucleus, and consists of the kinetic energy of
nucleons and the strong interaction among nucleons. Alternatively, it is expressed
in an appropriate model such as the shell model or the collective model. We assume
that the eigenstates and the corresponding eigenvalues are known and express as

Coulomb Gauge
It is convenient to adopt the Coulomb gauge, known also as the transverse gauge or
the radiation gauge [23]:

the radiation ﬁeld is given by

(A.139)
If we put the time dependence as e−ickt, then we obtain the Helmholtz equation
(Δ + k2)A = 0 .
(A.140)
Note that Eq.(A.137) indicates that the vector potential A is perpendicular to the di-
rection of the propagation of the wave (k ⊥A), i.e., that the wave is a transverse wave.
A.9.2.2
Rotational Transformation of Vector Wave Function
and the Spin and Intrinsic Wave Function of Photon
When one uses the spherical polar coordinates and makes the partial wave expansion,
the solution of the Helmholtz equation(A.140) for the partial wave ℓis nothing but
jℓ(kr) provided the ﬁeld is a scalar ﬁeld. In reality, photons are described by a vector
ﬁeld, so that they have spin 1 as we show later. It is therefore necessary to extend the
wave function so as to be a simultaneous eigenfunction of ˆL
2, ˆS
2, ˆJ
2 and ˆJz.
(i) The Transformation Property of a Vector Function: Let us ﬁrst study how a
vector function V(r, θ, ϕ) is transformed under rotation. One needs to consider both
the transformation of vector components and that of coordinates under rotation. For
example, when one rotates the coordinate system through α about the z-axis, the
vector components in the new coordinate system are given by
⎛
⎝
V ′
x(r, θ, ϕ)
V ′
y(r, θ, ϕ)

⎠.
(A.141)

Appendix A: Important Formulae and Their Derivation
249
For small α, Eq.(A.141) can be represented as
V′ = (1 + iα ˆJz)V + O(α2) ,
(A.142)
where ˆJz is given by

x ∂

(A.145)
ez × means to take the outer product between the unit vector in the z-axis ez and the
vector V which appears on the right side in Eq.(A.142).
Exercise A.4 Prove Eq.(A.143) by noting that Eq.(A.141) leads to
V ′
x(r, θ, ϕ) = Vx(r, θ, ϕ) + α ∂
∂ϕ Vx + αVy ,
(A.146)
V ′
z(r, θ, ϕ) = Vz(r, θ, ϕ) + α ∂

(A.147)
and that
ez × V = eyVx −exVy .
(A.148)
(ii) Spin of a Photon: Equation(A.145) shows that the intrinsic spin operator of a
photon is given by
ˆSx = iex × ,
ˆSy = iey × ,
ˆSz = iez × .
(A.149)
Also, the total angular momentum is given by
ˆJ = ˆL + ˆS .
(A.150)
Exercise A.5 Show that ˆS deﬁned by Eq.(A.149) satisﬁes the commutation relations
of the angular momentum operator.
(iii) The Eigenvectors of the Intrinsic Spin of Photon: If we deﬁne
e+1 = −1

e0 = ez ,
e−1 =

in terms of the unit vectors in the x, y, z direction by following the general rule that
relates the 1, 0, −1 components of a tensor of rank 1 to the x, y, z components of a
vector, we can show that
ˆS
2eq = 2eq,
ˆSzeq = qeq
(q = ±1, 0) .
(A.152)
Equation(A.152) shows that the magnitude of the intrinsic spin of photon is 1 and
that the eigenvector corresponding to Sz = q is eq.
A.9.2.3
Vector Spherical Harmonics
(i) Deﬁnition: From the above arguments, it follows that the wave function of photon,
which is the simultaneous eigenfunction of ˆL
2, ˆS
2, ˆJ
2 and ˆJz, is given by
YJℓM(θ, ϕ) =

mq
⟨ℓ1 mq|J M⟩Yℓm(θ, ϕ)eq
(A.153)
by using the addition rule of two angular momenta. YJℓM(θ, ϕ) are called vector
spherical harmonics.
One can easily show that the vector spherical harmonics have the following prop-
erties,
ˆJ
2YJℓM(θ, ϕ) = J(J + 1)YJℓM(θ, ϕ) ,
(A.154)
ˆJzYJℓM(θ, ϕ) = MYJℓM(θ, ϕ) ,
(A.155)
ˆL
2YJℓM(θ, ϕ) = ℓ(ℓ+ 1)YJℓM(θ, ϕ) ,
(A.156)
ˆS
2YJℓM(θ, ϕ) = 2YJℓM(θ, ϕ) ,

and the orthogonality,

dΩY∗
JℓM(θ, ϕ) · YJℓM(θ, ϕ) = δJ J ′δℓℓ′δM M′ .
(A.158)
Note that there exist three kinds of vector spherical harmonics YJ J M(θ, ϕ) and
YJ J±1M(θ, ϕ), which have different values of the orbital angular momentum for each
set of J, M. They can be classiﬁed into the following two groups depending on the
difference of parity:
• YJ J M(θ, ϕ): Parity (−1)J
This corresponds to the magnetic ﬁeld for the electric multipole radiation and to
the electric ﬁeld for the magnetic multipole radiation.

Eigenfunctions of Photon
(i) General form: As described in Sect.A.9.2.3, there exist three independent solu-
tions of the Helmholtz equation which differ in the orbital angular momentum when
the total angular momentum of photon is given, which we denote by I. They have to
satisfy in addition the transversality condition ∇· A = 0 in order to be the wave func-
tion of photon. Equation(A.159) shows that jI(kr)YI I M(θ, ϕ) satisﬁes this condi-
tion. The other wave functions, which are orthogonal to this wave function, are given
by taking linear combinations of jI+1(kr)YI I+1M(θ, ϕ) and jI−1(kr)YI I−1M(θ, ϕ).
Among them, the unique wave function which fulﬁlls the transversality condition is

by using the indices M and E, respectively. N is the normalization constant.
(ii) Quantization of the Wave Number: The wave number is quantized by con-
sidering a perfectly conducting sphere of radius R,8 and by imposing the following
boundary conditions on the surface [23],
E∥= 0 ,
B⊥= 0 .
(A.166)
Since E = −1

Derivation of the Pairing Energy
In this section, we outline the derivation of Eqs.(5.67)–(5.69) for the pairing energy
due to the residual interaction of the δ-function type given by Eq.(5.66).
We ﬁrst remark that the antisymmetrized wave function of two-nucleon system is
given by Eq.(5.63). We assume that each wave function |( jα jβ)J M⟩is normalized.
The normalization constant N is then given by
N =

Since the residual interaction is independent of spin, it is convenient to transform
the wave function from the j j-coupling scheme to the LS-coupling scheme. It can
be achieved by means of a recoupling coefﬁcient as

The factor [1 + (−1)S] shows that only S = 0 state contributes. This is a consequence
of the δ-force for the two-body system of identical nucleons. The isospin wave
function for the system of identical nucleons is symmetric. On the other hand, the
δ-force has a ﬁnite effect only in the positive parity states, i.e., spatially symmetric
states. Consequently, the δ-force affects only the spin singlet state. Equation(A.208)
now becomes
