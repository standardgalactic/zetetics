Abstract
The public release of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked tremendous
interest in how humans will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to accomplish a variety of
tasks. In our study conducted with Boston Consulting Group, a global management
consulting firm, we examine the performance implications of AI on realistic,
complex, and knowledge-intensive tasks. The pre-registered experiment involved
758 consultants comprising about 7% of the individual contributor-level consultants
at the company. After establishing a performance baseline on a similar task, subjects
were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no AI access, GPT-4 AI access,
or GPT-4 AI access with a prompt engineering overview.
We suggest that the
capabilities of AI create a “jagged technological frontier” where some tasks are
easily done by AI, while others, though seemingly similar in difficulty level, are
outside the current capability of AI. For each one of a set of 18 realistic consulting
tasks within the frontier of AI capabilities, consultants using AI were significantly
more productive (they completed 12.2% more tasks on average, and completed tasks
25.1% more quickly), and produced significantly higher quality results (more than
40% higher quality compared to a control group).
Consultants across the skills
distribution benefited significantly from having AI augmentation, with those below
the average performance threshold increasing by 43% and those above increasing by
17% compared to their own scores. For a task selected to be outside the frontier,
however, consultants using AI were 19 percentage points less likely to produce correct
solutions compared to those without AI. Further, our analysis shows the emergence of
two distinctive patterns of successful AI use by humans along a spectrum of human-
AI integration. One set of consultants acted as “Centaurs,” like the mythical half-
horse/half-human creature, dividing and delegating their solution-creation activities
to the AI or to themselves. Another set of consultants acted more like “Cyborgs,”
completely integrating their task flow with the AI and continually interacting with
the technology.

Introduction
The capabilities of Artificial Intelligence to produce human-like work have improved
rapidly, especially since the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, one of several Large Language
Models (LLMs) that are widely available for public use. As AI capabilities overlap more
with those of humans, the integration of human work with AI poses new fundamental
challenges and opportunities, in particular in knowledge-intensive domains.
In this
paper, we examine this issue using randomized controlled field experiments with highly
skilled professional workers.
Our results demonstrate that AI capabilities cover an
expanding, but uneven, set of knowledge work we call a "jagged technological frontier.”
Within this growing frontier, AI can complement or even displace human work; outside
of the frontier, AI output is inaccurate, less useful, and degrades human performance.
However, because the capabilities of AI are rapidly evolving and poorly understood,
it can be hard for professionals to grasp exactly what the boundary of this frontier
might be at a given. We find that professionals who skillfully navigate this frontier gain
large productivity benefits when working with the AI, while AI can actually decrease
performance when used for work outside of the frontier.
Though LLMs are new, the impact of other, earlier forms of AI have been the subject
of considerable scholarly discussion (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al. (2018); Furman and Seamans
(2019); Puranam (2021)). Because of the limitations of these earlier forms of AI, nonroutine
tasks that were difficult to codify seemed protected from automation (Autor et al., 2003;
Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019), especially as previous waves of technology had mostly
automated lower-skilled occupations (Goldin and Katz, 1998). The release of ChatGPT in
November, 2022 changed both the nature and urgency of the discussion. LLMs proved
unexpectedly capable at creative, analytical, and writing tasks, including scoring at top
levels at graduate and professional examinations (Girotra et al., 2023; Geerling et al., 2023;
Kung et al., 2023; Boussioux et al., 2023). This represented an entirely new category of
automation, one whose abilities overlapped with the most creative, most educated, and
most highly paid workers (Eloundou et al., 2023).
Studies of previous generations of AI (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023) and controlled
1

experiments on the impact of recently released LLMs (e.g., Noy and Zhang (2023); Choi
and Schwarcz (2023)) suggest that these systems can have a large impact on worker
performance. In our study, we focus on complex tasks, selected by industry experts to
replicate real-world workflows as experienced by knowledge workers. Most knowledge
work includes this sort of flow, a set of interdependent tasks, some of which may be
good fit for current AI, while some are not. We examine both kinds of tasks, and build
on recent studies to suggest ways of understanding the rapidly evolving impact of AI on
knowledge workers, under which circumstances organizations may benefit, and how this
might change as the technology advances.
This is important because understanding the implications of LLMs for the work
of organizations and individuals has taken on urgency among scholars, workers,
companies, and even governments (Agrawal et al., 2018; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2020; Berg
et al., 2023). Previous forms of AI led to considerable debate in the literature around how
and whether professionals should adopt AI for knowledge work (Anthony et al., 2023)
and the potential impact this might have on organizations (Raisch and Krakowski, 2021;
Glaeser et al., 2021; Brynjolfsson et al., 2021). Some scholars focused on the potential
for AI to help professionals improve their effectiveness and efficiency (DeStefano et al.,
2022; Balakrishnan et al., 2022; Valentine and Hinds, 2023). Others demonstrated that, for
critical tasks, it can be risky for professionals to use AI (Lebovitz et al., 2021), especially
black-boxed (e.g., Lebovitz et al. (2022); Waardenburg et al. (2022)), and showed how
professionals are struggling to use it effectively (Pachidi et al., 2021; Van den Broek et al.,
2021). Finally, another group of researchers argued that the “algorithmic management”
afforded by AI can create negative personal impacts for professionals (Kellogg et al., 2020;
Möhlmann et al., 2021; Tong et al., 2021) and raise accountability and ethical questions
(Choudhury et al., 2020; Cowgill et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2024). Yet, most of the studies
predate ChatGPT, and investigate forms of AI designed to produce discrete predictions
based on past data. These systems are quite different from LLMs.
Specifically, outside of their technical differences from previous forms of machine
learning, there are three aspects of LLMs that suggest they will have a much more
rapid, and widespread, impact on work.
The first is that LLMs have surprising
2

capabilities that they were not specifically created to have, and ones that are growing
rapidly over time as model size and quality improve.
Trained as general models,
LLMs nonetheless demonstrate specialist knowledge and abilities as part of their training
process and during normal use (Singhal et al., 2022; Boiko et al., 2023). While considerable
debate remains on the concept of emergent capabilities from a technological perspective
(Schaeffer et al., 2023), the effective capabilities of AIs are novel and unexpected, widely
applicable, and are increasing greatly in short time spans.
Recent work has shown
that AI performs at a high level in professional contexts ranging from medicine to law
(Ali et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023), and beats humans on many measures of innovation
(Boussioux et al., 2023; Girotra et al., 2023). And, while score performance on various
standardized academic tests is an imperfect measure of LLM capabilities, it has been
increasing substantially with each generation of AI models (OpenAI, 2023).
The general ability of LLMs to solve domain-specific problems leads to the second
differentiating factor of LLMs compared to previous approaches to AI: their ability to
directly increase the performance of workers who use these systems, without the need
for substantial organizational or technological investment.
Early studies of the new
generation of LLMs suggest direct performance increases from using AI, especially for
writing tasks (Noy and Zhang, 2023) and programming (Peng et al., 2023), as well as
for ideation and creative work (Boussioux et al., 2023; Girotra et al., 2023). As a result,
the effects of AI are expected to be higher on the most creative, highly paid, and highly
educated workers (Eloundou et al., 2023; Felten et al., 2023)
The final relevant characteristic of LLMs is their relative opacity. This extends to the
failure points of AI models, which include a tendency to produce incorrect, but plausible,
results (hallucinations or confabulations), and to make other types of errors, including in
math and when providing citations. The advantages of AI, while substantial, are similarly
unclear to users. It performs well at some jobs, and fails in other circumstances in ways
that are difficult to predict in advance. Contributing further to the opacity is that the best
ways to use these AI systems are not provided by their developers and appear to be best
learned via ongoing user trial-and-error and the sharing of experiences and heuristics via
various online forums like user groups, hackathons, Twitter feeds and YouTube channels.

Taken together, these three factors – the surprising abilities of LLMs, their ability to
do real work with virtually no technical skill required of the user, and their opacity and
unclear failure points – suggest that the value and downsides of AI may be difficult for
workers and organizations to grasp. Some unexpected tasks (like idea generation) are
easy for AIs, while other tasks that seem to be easy for machines to do (like basic math)
are challenges for some LLMs. This creates a “jagged Frontier,” where tasks that appear
to be of similar difficulty may either be performed better or worse by humans using
AI. Due to the “jagged” nature of the frontier, the same knowledge workflow of tasks
can have tasks on both sides of the frontier, see Figure 1. The future of understanding
how AI impacts work involves understanding how human interaction with AI changes
depending on where tasks are placed on this frontier, and how the frontier will change
over time. Investigating how humans navigate this jagged frontier, and the subsequent
performance implications, is the focus of our work.
We collaborated with a global management consulting firm (Boston Consulting Group
- BCG) and advised them on designing, developing, and executing two pre-registered
randomized experiments to assess the impact of AI on high human capital professionals.
Subsequently, the author team received the data that the company collected for the
purpose of this experiment and conducted the analysis presented in this paper.
The
study was structured in three phases: an initial demographic and psychological profiling,
a main experimental phase involving multiple task completions, and a concluding
interview segment. We tested two distinct tasks: one situated outside the frontier of
AI capabilities and the other within its bounds. The experiment aimed to understand
how AI integration might reshape the traditional workflows of these high human capital
professionals.
Our results show that this generation of LLMs are highly capable of causing significant
increases in quality and productivity, or even completely automating some tasks, but the
actual tasks that AI can do are surprising and not immediately obvious to individuals or
even to producers of LLMs themselves. Because this frontier is expanding and changing,
the overall results suggest that AI will have a large impact on work, one which will
increase with LLM capabilities, but where the impacts occur will be uneven.

Methods
We collected data from two randomized experiments to assess the causal impact of AI,
specifically GPT-4 – the most capable of the AI models at the time of the experiments
(Spring 2023) – on high human capital professionals working traditionally without AI.1
We pre-registered our study, detailing the design structure, the experimental conditions,
the dependent variables, and our main analytical approaches.2 Our aim was to determine
how introducing this AI into the tasks of highly-skilled knowledge workers might
augment, disrupt, or influence their traditional workflows.
BCG individual contributor consultants around the world were offered the
opportunity to spend 5 hours working on this experiment to evaluate the impact of AI
on their activities. Approximately 7% of BCG’s global individual contributor consultants’
cohort engaged in and completed the experiment.
The experiment was structured into three distinct phases. Initially, consultants entered
the study by completing a survey that captured their demographic and psychological
profiles, as well as details about their role within the company.
A few weeks after
enrolling, participants received a link to complete the main experimental phase. This
phase commenced with a pre-task survey, followed by the tasks detailed subsequently,
and concluded with a post-task survey. In the final phase, participants were interviewed
to share their experiences and perspectives on the role of AI in their profession.
In the first phase, we administered an enrollment survey to gather information about
potential participants.3
This survey captured details such as office location, internal
affiliation, and tenure at BCG. Participants also completed psychological assessments,
specifically providing insights into their Big 5 personality traits (Soto and John, 2017),
innovativeness (Agarwal and Prasad, 1998), self-perceived creativity (Miron-Spektor
et al., 2004), and paradox mindset (Miron-Spektor et al., 2018).
Furthermore, the
survey included a short section on their reading habits (including their familiarity with

AI characters in fiction), and demographic details like gender, native language, and
educational background. We utilized these data for stratified random assignment and
as controls in our regression models, as described below.
The study encompassed 758 strategy consultants, each of whom completed the initial
survey and experimental tasks. Each participant was assigned to one of two distinct
experiments. Stratification of participants was based on multiple criteria, both between
experiments and across experimental treatments. These criteria included gender, location,
tenure at BCG, individual openness to innovation, and native English-speaking status.
This information was collected with the survey administered during phase one, a few
weeks before the main experiment.
In order to ensure genuine engagement and effort from participants, we incentivized
their performance in the experiment.
Participants who diligently participated in all
aspects of the experiment were honored with an "office contribution" recognition,
carrying financial implications related to their annual bonuses. Furthermore, to recognize
and reward excellence, the top 20% of participants received additional recognition, and
the top 5% was also awarded with a small gift. Executives at BCG reported that the
recognition received by top participants was important because it was shared with the
committee that oversees their career development and performance assessments.
Subjects were allocated to one of two distinct experiments, each involving a
unique type of task, with no overlap between the groups. Both tasks were designed
in collaboration with multiple people at BCG to represent some of the typical job
activities encountered by individual contributor consultants. Approximately half of the
participants (385 consultants) tackled a series of tasks where they were prompted to
conceptualize and develop new product ideas, focusing on aspects such as creativity,
analytical skills, persuasiveness and writing skills.
The other half (373 consultants)
engaged in business problem-solving tasks using quantitative data, customer and
company interviews, and including a persuasive writing component. Both sets of tasks
were developed to be realistic, and were designed with the input of professionals in
the respective sectors. A senior level executive at the company commented on these
tasks being “very much in line with part of the daily activities” of the subjects involved.

Notably, some forms of these tasks are also used by the company to screen job applicants,
typically from elite academic backgrounds (including Ph.D.s), for their highly-coveted
positions.
Both experiments followed a consistent structure. Initially, participants undertook a
task without the aid of AI, establishing a baseline for performance and enabling within-
subject analyses. Following this, participants were randomly assigned to one of three
conditions to assess the influence of AI on their tasks, with these conditions being
consistent across both experiments.
The first group (a control condition) proceeded
without AI support; the second (“GPT Only”) had the assistance of an AI tool based
on GPT-4; and the third (“GPT + Overview”) not only utilized the same AI tool but
also benefited from supplementary prompt engineering overview, which increased their
familiarity with AI. These materials included instructional videos and documents that
outlined and illustrated effective usage strategies.
Rather than relying on self-reported metrics or indirect indicators, we directly assessed
participants’ skills through a task that closely mirrored the main experiment. In both
experiments, we employ an assessment task that, while different from the experimental
task, is highly comparable, ensuring a precise evaluation of skills for this specific task
type.4 Our findings indicate that performance in the assessment task is a predictor of
performance in the experimental task, allowing us to study the differential effects of
introducing AI to participants of different skill levels.
Each task assigned to participants came with a specific time allocation.
In the
experiment using a task inside the frontier, the assessment task duration was set for 30
minutes, while the subsequent one was allotted 90 minutes. Conversely, in the outside-
the-frontier experiment, both the first and second tasks were designated 60 minutes each,
though participants could complete them earlier if they finished ahead of time. It is
important to note that for the task inside the frontier, participants were required to remain
on the task’s page for the entire duration of the task, and could not complete the exercise
earlier. This approach ensured that our analysis for the inside-the-frontier tasks focused
4Dell’Acqua et al. (2023) adopts a comparable experimental framework to evaluate subjects’
competencies.
7

chiefly on the qualitative differences, rather than any timing improvements brought
about by using AI. These timeframes were automatically enforced, with the experimental
system advancing to the next question once the stipulated time for a task elapsed.
In every experimental task, subjects assigned to the AI conditions had access to
a company platform. This platform, developed using the OpenAI API, facilitated an
interactive experience with OpenAI’s GPT-4, mirroring the dynamics of ChatGPT. It
enabled the collection of all participants’ prompts and AI’s corresponding responses,
providing a comprehensive view into the collaborative behaviors between subjects and
AI. All subjects used the same version of the tool, accessing GPT-4 as available at the end
of April, 2023, and using default system prompts and temperature.
Aside from the thematic differences, the tasks differed in another key way. While both
were designed to be comparably complex and realistic, the first task was selected to be
within the potential technological frontier of GPT-4. The second experiment was designed
so that GPT-4 would make an error when conducting the analysis, ensuring the work fell
just outside the frontier.

Quality and Productivity Booster - Inside the Frontier
The inside-the-frontier experiment focused on creative product innovation and
development. The initial assessment task asked participants to brainstorm innovative
beverage concepts. From their set of ideas, they identified the most viable option and
devised a comprehensive plan for its market debut. After this task, subjects moved to the
main experimental phase and the context transitioned to the main experimental task.
In this experimental task, participants were tasked with conceptualizing a footwear
idea for niche markets and delineating every step involved, from prototype description
to market segmentation to entering the market.
An executive from a leading global
footwear company verified that the task design covered the entire process their company

typically goes through, from ideation to product launch.5
Participants responded to
a total of 18 tasks (or as many as they could within the given time frame).
These
tasks spanned various domains. Specifically, they can be categorized into four types:
creativity (e.g., “Propose at least 10 ideas for a new shoe targeting an underserved
market or sport.”), analytical thinking (e.g., “Segment the footwear industry market
based on users.”), writing proficiency (e.g., “Draft a press release marketing copy for
your product.”), and persuasiveness (e.g., “Pen an inspirational memo to employees
detailing why your product would outshine competitors.”). This allowed us to collect
comprehensive assessments of quality. All tasks and details are reported in Appendix A.
In the experiment, the primary outcome variable is the quality of the subjects’
responses. To quantify this quality, we employed a set of human graders to evaluate
each question that participants didn’t leave unanswered.6 Each response was evaluated
by two human graders. We then calculated the mean grade assigned by humans to each
question. This gave us 18 dependent variables (one per each question). We subsequently
averaged these scores across all questions to derive a composite “Quality” score, which
we use in our main analyses. As an additional assessment, we also utilized GPT-4, to
independently score the subjects’ responses. Similarly to the human grades, we produced
a score for each one of the 18 questions, and then a composite “Quality (GPT)” score.
Figure 2 uses the composite human grader score and visually represents the
performance distribution across the three experimental groups, with the average score
plotted on the y-axis. A comparison of the dashed lines and the overall distributions of
the experimental conditions clearly illustrates the significant performance enhancements
associated with the use of GPT-4. Both AI conditions show clear superior performance to
the control group not using GPT-4.
Table 1 presents the results of the analyses using response quality as the dependent
variable and highlights the performance implications of using AI. Columns 1, 2, and
3 utilize human-generated grades as the dependent variable, while Column 4 uses the

composite grades generated by GPT-4. Across all specifications, both treatments — GPT
+ Overview and GPT Only — demonstrate positive effects. In Column 1, GPT + Overview
leads to a 1.75 increase in scores over the control mean of 4.1, which is a 42.5% increase;
GPT Only led to a 1.56, or 38% increase.
Notably, Columns 2, 3, and 4 incorporate
performance metrics from the assessment task and the treatment coefficients they report
remain very consistent. Column 4 uses GPT scores as the dependent variable, and shows
coefficients of 1.34 for the GPT + Overview treatment and 1.21 for the GPT Only treatment
over the control group, which are equal respectively to 18.6% and 16.8% increases in
performance.7
The beneficial impacts of using AI remain consistent across all our specifications. We
merged our AI treatments and used all our pre-registered quality variables as dependent
variables. This included individual grades for each question as evaluated by humans, as
well as grades evaluated by GPT-4, based on the three specifications outlined in Columns
1-3 of Table 1. This resulted in a comprehensive set of 108 regressions. All of these
regressions showed a significant effect of introducing AI on consultants’ performance.
Figures 3 and 4 show 54 of these regressions each. Additionally, three dashed lines report
the average effects of each regression. The mean effect size when comparing subjects
using AI with a control with no GPT-4 access is 1.69 (a 46.6% increase over the control
mean) when using human evaluations and 1.36 (20.2%) when using GPT-4 evaluations.
Another key observation from the table is the differential impact of the two AI
treatments.
Specifically, the GPT + Overview treatment consistently exhibits a more
pronounced positive effect compared to the GPT Only treatment. The bottom of the
table displays a p-value that tests whether the effects of receiving GPT + Overview were
equivalent to those of being assigned to GPT Only, showing this value to be below
or around the conventional 5% threshold in all specifications.
This underscores the
importance of the added overview in enhancing the efficacy of AI assistance. However,
we should note that the overview increased “retainment” (i.e., copying and pasting the
GPT-4 output), and retainment itself was associated with better performance.8 The table
7These percentage improvements are relatively lower also because GPT-4 tends to be a more lenient
grader and scores our control baseline higher.

also highlights various other factors, such as gender, native English proficiency, tenure,
location, and tech openness, and their influence on the outcomes.9
Table 2 presents the results related to the percentage of task completion by subjects,
which is the dependent variable in this analysis.
Across Columns 1, 2, and 3, both
treatments — GPT + Overview and GPT Only — demonstrate a positive effect on task
completion. On average, these coefficients indicate a 12.2% increase in completion rates.10
The control group completed on average 82% of their tasks, while the GPT + Overview
condition completed about 93% and GPT Only about 91%. Column 2 incorporates the
performance metric from the assessment, and Column 3 further extends the analysis
by including the same set of controls as in Table 1. The coefficients suggest that the
integration of AI tools enhances the rate of task completion very significantly, at the same
time as it increases quality.
Figure 5 presents an important trend: the most significant beneficiaries of using AI
are the bottom-half-skill subjects, consistent with findings from Noy and Zhang (2023)
and Choi and Schwarcz (2023).11 By segmenting subjects exposed to one of the two AI
conditions into two distinct categories — top-half-skill performers (those ranking in the
top 50% on the assessment task) and bottom-half-skill performers (those in the bottom
50%) — we observed performance enhancements in the experimental task for both groups
when leveraging GPT-4. When comparing the two groups, though, we see the bottom-
half-skill performers exhibited the most substantial surge in performance, 43%, compared
to the top-half-skill subjects, 17%. Note that the top-half-skill performers also receive a
significant boost, although not as much as the bottom-half-skill performers.
For the task inside the frontier, we did not allow any subjects to complete the task
before the allotted time was over. Instead, their final question was an especially long
9We employ binary variables for all these factors. "Female" is set to 1 if a subject identifies as female and
0 otherwise. "English Native" is 1 if a subject claims native proficiency in English and 0 otherwise (nearly
every subject indicates either Native or Advanced proficiency in English). "Low Tenure" is 1 if a subject has
been with BCG for a year or less, and 0 otherwise. "Location" is 1 if a subject’s office is located in Europe or
the Middle East, and 0 otherwise. Lastly, "Tech Openness" is 1 if the subject expressed a higher receptivity
to technology in their enrollment survey, and 0 otherwise.
10When directly comparing the two AI treatments at the bottom of the table, the difference in their
impacts is not statistically significant.
11It is important to note that "higher-skill" and "lower-skill" here are relative. All these consultants would
appear to be extremely high-skill in most other real-world contexts.

one asking them to “synthesize the insights you have gained from the previous questions
and create an outline for a Harvard Business Review-style article of approximately 2,500
words.” However, while participants were required to take the full time allotted to
this task, we nevertheless tracked the amount of time that they took to reach this last
question, having completed the first 17 questions. Table 3 uses this Timing variable as
the dependent variable. The GPT + Overview treatment makes subjects faster by 1129
seconds (18.8 minutes or 22.5% faster than the control), while the GPT Only treatment
reduces time spent on the first 17 questions by 1388 seconds (23.13 minutes or 27.63%
faster than the control).
Exploring the variation in content generated by subjects,
our focus was on
understanding the diversity of their responses in relation to others.
By employing
Google’s Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), we semantically analyzed the ideas
presented by subjects in the first question of the inside-the-frontier experiment (“Generate
ideas for a new shoe aimed at a specific market or sport that is underserved. Be creative,
and give at least 10 ideas”). Our findings indicate that while subjects using AI produce
ideas of higher quality, as discussed in the previous sections, there is a marked reduction
in the variability of these ideas compared to those not using AI. This suggests that while
GPT-4 aids in generating superior content, it might lead to more homogenized outputs.
Figure 6 shows the distribution of similarity across experimental groups. For a detailed
analysis, refer to Appendix D.
Our results reveal significant effects, underscoring the prowess of AI even in tasks
traditionally executed by highly skilled and well-compensated professionals. Not only
did the use of AI lead to an increase in the number of subtasks completed by an average
of 12.5%, but it also enhanced the quality of the responses by an average of more than
40%. These effects support the view that for tasks that are clearly within its frontier
of capabilities, even those that historically demanded intensive human interaction, AI
support provides huge performance benefits.

3.2
Quality Disruptor - Outside the frontier
In refining the task within the frontier and recognizing the substantial quality and
productivity gains from AI integration, we sought a task that AI couldn’t easily complete
through simple copying and pasting of our instructions as a prompt. We designed the
task outside the frontier using as a starting point the type of business cases that BCG
uses for its highly competitive job interviews.
Our goal was to design a task where
consultants would excel, but AI would struggle without extensive guidance. After several
iterations, we settled on a task based on an existing business case that used data on a
spreadsheet, as well as a file presenting interviews with company insiders, which were
adjusted and adapted to the goals of this experiment. To be able to solve the task correctly,
participants would have to look at the quantitative data using subtle but clear insights
from the interviews.
While the spreadsheet data alone was designed to seem to be
comprehensive, a careful review of the interview notes revealed crucial details. When
considered in totality, this information led to a contrasting conclusion to what would
have been provided by AI when prompted with the exercise instructions, the given data,
and the accompanying interviews.
In this second experiment, the primary objective was for subjects to offer actionable
strategic recommendations to a hypothetical company.
First, participants worked on
the assessment task, where they had to analyze the company’s channel performance.
Using insights from interviews and financial data, participants were asked to provide
information and informed advice to the CEO. Their recommendations were to pinpoint
which channel held the most potential for growth.
As subjects completed their assessment task, they moved to the main experimental
task. The focus transitioned from the examination of the company’s distribution channels
to brand analysis, as subjects had to analyze the company’s brand performance. Similarly
to the assessment task, participants used insights from interviews and financial data to
provide recommendations for the CEO. Their recommendations were to pinpoint which
brand held the most potential for growth. Additionally, participants were also expected
to suggest actions to improve the chosen brand, regardless of the exact brand they had
13

chosen. Details of these tasks are reported in Appendix A.
For this task outside the frontier, our primary metric of evaluation is ’correctness.’
This is represented as a binary variable, where a value of ’1’ indicates that subjects
provided the accurate recommendation, and ’0’ signifies otherwise. Figure 7 visually
presents the correctness percentages across different groups, highlighting a noticeable dip
in performance among the AI treatment groups when juxtaposed with the control group.
Subjects in the control group were correct about this exercise about 84.5% of the time,
while the AI conditions scored at 60% and 70% (for an average decrease of 19 percentage
points when combining the AI treatment conditions and comparing them to the control
condition).
Table 4 delves into the impact of the AI treatments on the correctness of tasks in
the outside-the-frontier experiment using linear regressions with correctness as a binary
dependent variable.
Both AI treatments— GPT + Overview and GPT Only — show
a significant negative impact, with the GPT + Overview group experiencing a more
pronounced decrease (24 percentage points versus 13 percentage points).
Column 2
introduces the performance metric from the assessment, while Column 3 further refines
the analysis by incorporating the same set of controls as in Tables 1 and 2. When directly
comparing the two treatments, the difference in their impacts is statistically significant at
the 10% threshold across specifications.
Table 5 examines the influence of the AI treatments on the time taken by participants
to complete tasks in the outside-the-frontier experiment. The dependent variable here
is "Timing," representing the duration subjects spent on the task calculated in seconds.
Column 2 further refines the analysis by incorporating the same set of controls as in Table
1. Both AI treatments — GPT + Overview and GPT Only — indicate a reduction in
the time spent, more than 11 minutes for GPT + Overview (a 30% decrease in timing
over the control mean), and more than 6 minutes for GPT Only (a decrease of 18%)
when compared to the control. When we compare the two coefficients, we find that
GPT + Overview shows a more substantial decrease in time, and one that is statistically
significant, compared to the GPT Only group.
Table 6 further examines the quality of recommendations provided by subjects in
14
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4573321

the outside-the-frontier experiment. The dependent variable, ‘Recommendation Quality,’
measures the quality of the recommendations given. These were scored (on a 1-10 scale)
by two different sets of human graders (one of BCG consultants not involved in the
experiment, and the other of business school students with grading experience) following
a simple rubric, developed by the authors relying on their experience in consulting (see
Appendix B for the full rubric). Looking at Column 1, the treatment GPT + Overview
leads to a 1.47 greater score (25.1% increase over the control mean), while GPT Only
increases the score by 1.05 (17.9% over the control mean).
Across all specifications,
subjects using AI (both GPT + Overview and GPT Only) consistently outperformed those
not using AI in terms of recommendation quality, regardless of the correctness of their
answer. When we control for various factors (as in Table 1) in columns 2, 3, and 4, the
positive impact of AI remains robust. This result holds true regardless of the correctness
of the subjects’ answers, as evidenced in columns 3 and 4. Column 3 reports the same
regression in column 2 only for the subset of participants whose answers were incorrect,
while column 4 does the same for the subject of participants whose answers were correct.
In both instances, the effects of using AI are positive.
Figure 8 shows the quality of recommendations for people who were wrong in their
answers and for those who were right (Figure 8).
Both distributions show a clear
shift for the experimental groups using AI. That is, the quality of the recommendation
about a business problem-solving case increased, regardless of whether the underlying
recommendation was correct or not. This finding underscores the multifaceted ways in
which AI can influence performance in a workflow among highly skilled professionals.
3.3
Navigating the frontier
The experiments show that the shape and position of the frontier are vital to
understanding the impact of AI on work. On tasks within the frontier, AI significantly
improved human performance. Outside of it, humans relied too much on the AI and
were more likely to make mistakes. Not all users navigated the jagged frontier with equal
adeptness. While some completed their task incorrectly, others showcased a remarkable
ability to harness the power of AI effectively.
We conducted further analyses of the
15
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4573321

strategies adopted by those who managed to perform correctly in the outside-the-frontier
experimental task while using LLMs. Understanding the characteristics and behaviors
of these participants may prove important as organizations think about ways to identify
and develop talent for effective collaboration with AI tools.
We identified two predominant models that encapsulate their approach.
The first is Centaur behavior. Named after the mythical creature that is half-human
and half-horse, this approach involves a similar strategic division of labor between
humans and machines closely fused together.12 Users with this strategy switch between
AI and human tasks, allocating responsibilities based on the strengths and capabilities of
each entity. They discern which tasks are best suited for human intervention and which
can be efficiently managed by AI.
The second model we observed is Cyborg behavior.13 Named after hybrid human-
machine beings as envisioned in science fiction literature, this approach is about intricate
integration. Cyborg users don’t just delegate tasks; they intertwine their efforts with
AI at the very frontier of capabilities.
This strategy might manifest as alternating
responsibilities at the subtask level, such as initiating a sentence for the AI to complete or
working in tandem with the AI.
We are continuing to examine these behaviors using the experimental task’s GPT logs
and rich qualitative data gathered from the experiments in order to create an emerging
understanding of these behaviors. We are also investigating the impact of these behaviors
on performance. Appendix E further explores these behaviors.

Discussion
In this paper, we study the integration of AI with a jagged capability frontier into
contemporary human real-world, high-end knowledge work tasks. We use a randomized
field experiment to illuminate the dual role of AI as both a booster, enhancing efficiency
and productivity, and a disruptor, negatively impacting performance in tasks outside its

frontier. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of AI and offer insights into
harnessing its capabilities for optimal outcomes. A crucial feature of our experiment was
the availability of our experimental subjects. Specifically, we tapped into a high human
capital population, with participants who were not only highly skilled but also engaged
in tasks that closely mirrored part of their professional activities.
We found that the utility of AI can fluctuate over the course of a professional’s
workflow, with some tasks falling inside while others fall outside of the frontier. For
tasks inside the frontier, these findings carry large performance implications. Across
18 realistic business tasks, AI significantly increased performance and quality for every
model specification, increasing speed by more than 25%, performance as rated by humans
by more than 40%, and task completion by more than 12%. Further, it operated in a
way that benefitted bottom-half performers the most, though all users benefitted from
AI. Thus, AI seems to both level performance differences across levels of ability and
raise the quality of work for inside-the-frontier tasks. These findings suggest a need
to understand how work can be organized to better integrate AI. Tasks outside the AI
frontier also present opportunities for individuals to operate as either cyborgs or centaurs.
Cyborgs integrate AI and human capabilities at a granular, sub-task level, while centaurs
strategically delegate between human and AI sub-tasks. In our sample, we observed
these two behaviors (see Appendix E). It is clear that the best approaches to using AI are
not fully understood and need to be deeply examined by scholars and practitioners.
It was only when we identified tasks outside the frontier that we saw performance
decreases as a result of AI. On those tasks, this study highlights the importance of
validating and interrogating AI (Lebovitz et al., 2022) and of continuing to exert cognitive
effort and experts’ judgment when working with AI (Dell’Acqua, 2022). Professionals
who had a negative performance when using AI tended to blindly adopt its output and
interrogate it less (“unengaged interaction with AI” Lebovitz et al. (2022)). Appendix B
presents a "retainment" score measuring how common blind adoption was among our
subjects.
These findings raise questions regarding when and how to know whether
to trust LLMs (Glikson and Woolley, 2020) in particular as AI tools impact employees’
performance and their subsequent evaluation (Teodorescu et al., 2021; Gkeredakis, 2022).
17
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4573321

For AI designers and companies, these findings offer an important path for designing AI
tools and for building navigation capabilities of the users (Lebovitz et al., 2021; Valentine
and Hinds, 2023).
More broadly, these findings raise questions regarding using AI for high-risk tasks
and responsible AI, a topic that is highly debated by AI policymakers and academics
(Waardenburg et al., 2022; Rahman et al., 2024; AI Act, 2023).
An immediate danger
emerging from these findings, for instance, is that people will stop delegating work
inside the frontier to junior workers, creating long-term training deficits (Beane, 2019).14
Navigating the frontier requires expertise, which will need to be built through formal
education (Osterman, 2011; Myers and Kellogg, 2022), on-the-job training (Kellogg et al.,
2021), and employee-driven upskilling (Leonardi and Neeley, 2022; Iansiti and Nadella,
2022).
In this study, we focus on the individual level of analysis but, as we had such a large
number of professionals from within a single organization (BCG), this study clearly offers
organization-level implications as well. First, our findings bring in a nuanced response to
the ongoing debate on whether organizations should adopt AI for high-end knowledge
work. The results suggest that this debate should move beyond the dichotomous decision
of adopting or not AI and instead focus on the knowledge workflow and the tasks
within it, and in each of them, evaluate the value of using different configurations and
combinations of humans and AI. This will require rethinking collaboration between
humans and AI (Anthony et al., 2023; Faraj and Leonardi, 2022; Feuerriegel et al., 2022),
how new roles will emerge and be created (Barrett et al., 2012; Allen and Choudhury,
2022; Kellogg, 2022; Sergeeva et al., 2020), how adoption will be shaped by stakeholders in
the organization and beyond (Sendak et al., 2020; Hillebrand et al., 2023), new capabilities
and strategies (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2020) and new forms of organizing (Bailey et al., 2022;
Beane and Leonardi, 2022). Moreover, the significant impact on creativity suggests AI
should play a role in the future of organizing for innovation (Kittur et al., 2019; Amabile,
2020; Raj et al., 2023; Lifshitz-Assaf and Lazar, 2023; Boussioux et al., 2023).
The potential for diminished diversity of ideas stemming from AI usage could
14AI could also play a role in supporting human training (Gaessler and Piezunka, 2023).
18

pose challenges for organizations (e.g., Page (2019) (see appendix D)). As companies
increasingly integrate AI into their operations, they must consider whether employing
a variety of AI models, possibly multiple LLMs, or increased human-only involvement,
could counteract this homogenization (with the associated tradeoffs). This underscores
the significance of maintaining a diverse AI ecosystem. Moreover, the optimal AI strategy
might vary based on a company’s production function. While some organizations might
prioritize consistently high average outputs, others might value maximum exploration
and innovation.
Finally, there may be some general equilibrium considerations to
incorporate. Outputs like grants or articles might indeed be of superior quality when AI-
assisted. However, in a competitive landscape where many are leveraging AI, outputs
generated without AI assistance might stand out and achieve notable success due to
their distinctiveness. Clearly, the interplay between the quality and variability of ideas
is intricate, and further investigation is essential to unpack the nuances and implications
of these results.
Finally, we note that our findings offer multiple avenues for interpretation when
considering the future implications of human/AI collaboration.
Firstly, our results
lend support to the optimism about AI capabilities for important high-end knowledge
work tasks such as fast idea generation, writing, persuasion, strategic analysis, and
creative product innovation.
In our study, since AI proved surprisingly capable,
it was difficult to design a task in this experiment outside the AI’s frontier where
humans with high human capital doing their job would consistently outperform AI.
However, navigating AI’s jagged capabilities frontier remains challenging.
Even for
experienced professionals engaged in tasks akin to some of their daily responsibilities,
this demarcation is not always evident. As the boundaries of AI capabilities continue
to expand, often exponentially, it becomes incumbent upon human professionals to
recalibrate their understanding of the frontier and for organizations to prepare for a
new world of work combining humans and AI. Overall, AI seems poised to significantly
impact human cognition and problem-solving ability. Similarly to how the internet and
web browsers dramatically reduced the marginal cost of information sharing, AI may also
be lowering the costs associated with human thinking and reasoning, with potentially

broad and transformative effects.

Appendix
A
Tasks
In the following Appendix, we detail the specific tasks undertaken by subjects during
the experiments.
Both experiments started with an assessment task, serving as the
initial phase where all subjects were required to complete it without any assistance from
Generative AI. This initial task is crucial as it establishes a baseline, capturing the abilities
and skills of the subjects in the absence of AI support. The subsequent task represents the
core experimental phase. Here, subjects have the opportunity to leverage Generative AI,
with the level of access determined by their respective treatment assignments. We report
these tasks below for both experiments.
Outside the Frontier
Assessment Task
The CEO, Harold Van Muylders, would like to understand which of the three distribution
channels that the company uses (fully owned stores, franchisee stores, or online) to focus
his efforts.
Please find attached interviews from company insiders on this issue.
In
addition, the attached Excel sheet provides financial data broken down by distribution
channels.
Aim: Please prepare a 500-750 word note to the CEO. The note should focus on the
following:
• If the CEO must pick one distribution channel to focus on to drive profit growth in
the company, what channel should that be? What is the rationale for this choice?
Please support your views with data and/or interview quotations as appropriate.
• Please also suggest innovative and tactical actions the CEO can take to boost profit
growth in your chosen distribution channel. Please be creative, and feel free to rely
on your own business judgement on what is appropriate for Kleding.
Experimental Task
The CEO, Harold Van Muylders, would like to understand Kleding’s performance by the
company’s three brands (Kleding Man, Kleding Woman, and Kleding Kids) to uncover
deeper issues. Please find attached interviews from company insiders on this issue. In
addition, the attached excel sheet provides financial data broken down by brands.
Aim: Please prepare a 500-750 word note to the CEO. The note should focus on the
following:
• If the CEO must pick one brand to focus on and invest to drive revenue growth
in the company, what brand should that be? What is the rationale for this choice?

C Retainment
In this Appendix, we will focus on the concept of retainment, which captures the degree to which subjects
with access to GenerativeAI directly retain the content produced by the AI in their submitted answers. To
investigate retainment behavior, we will consider the creative problem-solving experiment, where
subjects conceptualize new product ideas through a series of questions.
Measuring Retainment
We operationalize the measurement of retainment by first considering how to compute the similarity
between two pieces of text. We utilize Restricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance (RDL) which essentially
measures the smallest amount of character edits (deletions, insertions, substitutions, or adjacent
transpositions) required to change one piece of text into another. Next, we note that we observe the entire
session log of interactions a subject has with ChatGPT, i.e, each textual prompt the subject inputs during
the session and each corresponding textual output the subject receives in response. Given the varying
nature and sequence of how subjects prompt during their sessions, it is not generally possible to
systematically map a single prompt/response to each question they are asked to answer. However, for a
given question asked of the subject, we can measure how similar (in RDL distance) their provided answer
is to each response they received from GPT during their session. We consider the smallest distance to
indicate the subject's retainment for the given question, and use this distance to produce a normalized
measure of retainment between the answer ( ) and the corresponding most similar response ( *):
𝑎
𝑟
. This measure of retainment is between 0 and 1; a 0
𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡(𝑎) = 1 −
𝑅𝐷𝐿(𝑎, 𝑟*)
𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ(𝑎), 𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ(𝑟*)} 
indicates that the subject completed changed every character between their submitted answer and the
response they received, while a 1 indicates that the subject reported the character-for-character response
as their answer. Our retainment measure would not fully capture when a subject’s answer is a combination
of multiple responses from ChatGPT, so ours is a conservative retainment measure.
Results
We compute each subject’s average retainment—their retainment averaged across all answers they
Figure 1: Distribution of Average Subject Answer Retainment
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4573321

submitted—and display its distribution in Figure 1. From the distribution, we can see that a majority of
subjects with access to ChatGPT retain a very high amount of its response in their submitted answers. The
mode of average retainment is approximately 0.87, for context such a retainment value for a singular
answer is quite high and can be obtained by changing a few words. Therefore, this result seems to clearly
indicate that subjects are essentially “copying and pasting” ChatGPT responses as their submitted
answers. It is natural to assume a high level of retainment indicates an abdication of judgment by the
subjects, and while this is one way to interpret Figure 1, we caution against simply drawing this
conclusion from the current results. Alternatively, a subject could be engaging in “high-quality”
prompting behavior, e.g., helping ChatGPT to iteratively refine its responses until it is perfected, and only
then retaining a high amount of the response in their answers. Currently, our analysis cannot distinguish
between the two, and in general, it is not straightforward how to assess prompting quality.
We further decompose Figure 1, and consider the distribution of average retainment for subjects who did
and did not receive training (in addition to ChatGPT access) in Figure 2 and observe that while this
pattern of high retainment is present in both groups, it is more extreme in the group that received
Figure 2: Distribution of Average Subject Retainment by Training Condition
training. This result appears to indicate that those subjects who receive training are more prone to
retaining large amounts of ChatGPT responses in their answers. This would be consistent with the
hypothesis that high retainment can come from engaging in high-quality prompting, which in turn can be
improved by the training. However, it could also indicate that the training increased trust in ChatGPT’s
ability to effectively answer the questions and further increased subjects’ willingness to abdicate
judgment. Given the ongoing conversation on the spectrum of A.I.’s propensity to augment vs. replace
human decision-making, a deep investigation into what is driving the retainment results of Figures 1 and 2
presents a fruitful future direction of research. There is considerable value in understanding if and which
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4573321

subjects are prone to abdicating their judgment to A.I. and if (even light) training interventions can
ameliorate or exacerbate this behavior.
Finally, while we do not know the mechanism by which subjects are selecting to retain high amounts of
ChatGPT responses, we can objectively measure if there is a relationship between the level of retainment
and answer quality. We obtained evaluations, ranging from 1 to 10, for each answer submitted by each
subject, in one of four categories the given question was constructed to capture: creativity, persuasiveness,
analyses, or writing quality. Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of the subject’s score and their
Figure 3: Relationship between Average Answer Quality and Average Retention
retention (both averaged over all questions), as well as the regression line capturing the linear
relationship. Essentially all subjects do a fair job (the regression intercept is approximately 7.55 and
highly significnat) which is not surprising given that the subjects represent the upper-end of the skills
distribution and this experimental task is very representative of their work tasks. However, even in this
highly-skilled subject pool, increased retainment of the response from ChatGPT is related to increased
performance (the coefficient is approximately 1.21 and highly significant). A cursory interpretation of the
result would be that for these types of creativity and writing tasks, results are generally better by
minimizing human intervention. While potentially accurate this question merits deeper examination in
future work, to layer in prompting behaviors or other dimensions that may explain the subject’s choice to
retain more (or less) of ChatGPT’s responses. Either way, what is clear is that those who choose to retain
to a relatively high degree produced significantly better answers on average, and that this certainly can
have a profound impact on how organizations consider the use of GenerativeAI technologies by their
employees.

D Collective Variation
In this Appendix, we will focus on the concept of variation in the content created by subjects.
Specifically, we are interested in the diversity of the answers an individual subject produces with respect
to the answers of other subjects. Importantly, we consider how the properties of these distributions are
impacted by access to GenerativeAI. This question is motivated by various debates on the impact of
GenerativeAI on firms, including how the ability for GenerativeAI to increase the productivity of
individual employees translates to overall improvements for the firm. To investigate the variation in the
content creation, we will consider the creative problem-solving experiment, and focus specifically on the
first question where subjects are asked to generate at least 10 ideas for a new shoe aimed at a specific
market or sport that is underserved.
Measuring Variation
We operationalize the measurement of variation by first considering how to compute the similarity
between the ideas described by two different pieces of text. While simple character or word similarity is a
possibility, this may fail to appropriately capture similarity between two pieces of text that express the
same idea, but do not use words in common. This highlights the importance of choosing the appropriate
representation for the pieces of text, and led us to use Goolge’s Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) to
build a representation that encodes the underlying meaning of the idea expressed in the text. More
specifically, USE is designed to encode a piece of text into a 512-dimensional embedding vector that
captures its underlying semantic meaning, in order to optimize transfer learning to downstream natural
language processing tasks. Given these semantic vector representations of two ideas described in text, we
can compute their vector inner-product to measure their semantic similarity. A subject produces
approximately 10 ideas in their answer, so we separate and encode each of these ideas. We then compute
the average inner-products between the idea of the given subject with all of the ideas produced by other
subjects, within the same experimental condition. For each subject’s idea, we then have a between-subject
idea similarity and can average it across all the subject’s 10 ideas to produce a subject level between
semantic similarity. This measure of semantic similarity allows us to capture the variation in ideas of the
collective experimental condition, where higher amounts of semantic similarity indicate less variation.
Results
In addition to the existing three experimental conditions, we artificially create a fourth condition (GPT
Only), where we directly provide our question the initial prompt to ChatGPT and treat its response as an
answer. We carry out this simulation in 100 independent ChatGPT sessions, each meant to represent a
separate GPT Only subject and compute the same between semantic similarity analyses within this GPT
Only condition.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4573321

We consider the between semantic similarity measured for each subject, and plot its distribution and mean
(with a vertical line) separately for each experimental condition in Figure 1. We observe that subjects
without access to ChatGPT tend to produce ideas with less semantic similarity (more conceptual
variation) than those without access, implying that usage of ChatGPT reduces the range of ideas the
subjects generate on average. We also observe that the GPT Only group has the highest degree of between
semantic similarity, measured across each of the simulated subjects. These two results taken together
point toward an interesting conclusion: the variation across responses produced by ChatGPT is smaller
than what human subjects would produce on their own, and as a result when human subjects

A (Access to ChatGPT), Group B (Access to ChatGPT + Training), Group C (No access to ChatGPT),
and GPT Only (Simulated ChatGPT Sessions).
use ChatGPT there is a reduction in the variation in the eventual ideas they produce. This result is
perhaps surprising one would assume that ChatGPT, with its expansive knowledge base, would instead be
able to produce many very distinct ideas, compared to human subjects alone. Moreover, the assumption is
that when a human subject is also paired with ChatGPT the diversity of their ideas would increase.
While Figure 1 indicates access to ChatGPT reduces variation in the human-generated ideas, it provides
no commentary on the underlying quality of the submitted ideas. We obtained evaluations of each
subject’s idea list along the dimension of creativity, ranging from 1 to 10, and present these results in
Table 1. The idea lists provided by subjects with access to ChatGPT are evaluated as having significantly
higher quality than those subjects without ChatGPT. Taken in conjunction with the between semantic
similarity results, it appears that access to ChatGPT helps each individual construct higher quality ideas
lists on average; however, these ideas are less variable and therefore are at risk of being more redundant.
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4573321

While these collective results may appear to imply important limitations of ChatGPT (i.e., the
convergence of ideas) from a firm’s perspective, there are questions that still must be answered before
arriving at such an important conclusion. Simply because the full set of 10 ideas for subjects with access
to ChatGPT is generally of higher quality and less variable does not imply the best idea(s) for each
subject follow this same pattern. Moreover, we cannot treat all subjects as homogenous, as some may use
ChatGPT to improve the variability of their ideas while maintaining (or increasing) their quality;
therefore, it is important to understand which types of subjects are potentially pushed toward more
redundant ideas These various hypotheses warrant a deeper investigation into the mechanisms behind
what we observe, and how to intervene to achieve the desired ends.

APPENDIX E 
Centaur and Cyborg Practices 
In many industries and for many types of analytic tasks, the discussion is no longer about 
whether to adopt AI but rather about how to use AI. This field experiment advances our 
understanding about how and when humans deeply engage with AI in knowledge work. By 
studying the knowledge work of 244 professional consultants as they used AI to complete a real-
world, analytic task, we found that new human-AI collaboration practices and reconfigurations 
are emerging as humans attempt to navigate the jagged frontier. Here, we detail a typology of 
practices we observed, which we conceptualize as Centaur and Cyborg practices. 
Centaur behavior. Named after the mythical creature that is half-human and half-horse, this 
approach involves a similar strategic division of labor between humans and machines closely 
fused together. Users with this strategy switch between AI and human tasks, allocating 
responsibilities based on the strengths and capabilities of each entity. They discern which tasks 
are best suited for human intervention and which can be efficiently managed by AI. From a 
frontier perspective, they are highly attuned to the jaggedness of the frontier and not conducting 
full sub-tasks with genAI but rather dividing the tasks into sub-tasks where the core of the task is 
done by them or genAI. Still, they use genAI to improve the output of many sub-tasks, even 
those led by them.  
For example, Figure 1 depicts how user BA1 applied the centaur practice of drawing on AI for a 
particular writing task (a relative strength of AI) while drawing on human knowledge for the 
tasks of data analysis and generating recommendations (relative strengths of humans). 
Specifically, BA1 used human knowledge to complete the task of generating a recommendation 
and related information, and then switched to AI to draft a memo. BA1 asked AI: 
You are writing a memo to a CEO of a company to inform him of where his company should 
focus as they attempt to drive revenue growth for one of their three brands, Kleding man. You 
want to provide him with the following facts for why he should focus on driving revenue growth 
for Kleding man… 
 
Our early analysis of Centaur practices suggests that particular practices tend to be used at 
particular times in the analytic process; for example, users engaged in the practice of drawing on 
AI for its strength in refining user text at the beginning or end of the analytic processes, to either 
help set up the analytic process, accessing general information or methods, or to structure and 
edit the final output. 
Cyborg behavior. Named after hybrid beings, as envisioned in science fiction literature, that 
seamlessly blend machine components with human biology, this approach is about intricate 
integration. Users do not just have a clear division of labor here between genAI and themselves; 
they intertwine their efforts with AI at the very frontier of capabilities. This manifests at the 
subtask level, when for an external observer it might even be hard to demarcate whether the 
output was produced by the human or the AI as they worked tightly on each of the activities 
related to the sub task.

2 
For example, Figure 2 depicts a different user, BA3, assigning his own professional persona (of 
a consultant) to the genAI to provide the input. Since LLMs are trained on a large breadth of 
data, assigning a persona can be used to guide AI to a particular set of data. In this example, BA3 
was responding to the previous output from AI, first asking AI to make editorial changes to the 
outputs, and then assigning a persona, instructing AI to “act as a consultant in the answering of 
the question.” 
We detail in Table 1 below examples of the centaur and cyborg practices we identify. Centaur 
practices entail using individual’s knowledge of the current strengths of generative AI relative to 
theirs to switch between human and AI for each of the sub-task of the tasks accordingly 
throughout the workflow (example in Figure 1: Centaur Practices – Using AI to Refine Input 
from User’s Strength). Cyborg practices entail tightly integrating AI and human outputs in the 
tasks (example in Figure 2:  Cyborg Practices – Using AI to Validate Work and Requesting 
Editorial Changes). Table 1 details the practices used by centaurs versus those used by cyborgs. 
Our analysis was conducted on a sub-task level and it could be that the same individual would be 
applying centaur behavior for one type of tasks and cyborg for another. Our early analysis 
suggests that several factors may explain . In particular, it seems that humans with different 
levels of skill in the task domain, with different degrees of hands-on practice with generative AI, 
and with different perceptions of the relationship between humans and AI, may use different sets 
of practices. We are also investigating this in detail and the impact of these behaviors on 
performance. We assume some of these practices enable navigating the jagged frontier in a 
superior way to others. 
Table 1: Centaur and Cyborg Practices 
Practices and Descriptions 
Centaur 
Practices 
Use individual’s knowledge of the current strengths of generative AI relative to 
theirs to switch between human and AI for each of the modules/sub-task of the 
tasks accordingly throughout the workflow.  
Examples of Behavior/practices (given the state of AI at the time of the 
experiment): 
•
Mapping Problem domain: Asking AI for general information related to
the problem’s domain for the human to use for their sub-task.
•
Gathering methods information: Asking AI for specific information on
methods that the human is employing to solve their sub-task
•
Refining human generated content: Users providing their own output and
using AI to refine its presentation.
Cyborg Practices Use AI for each of the sub-tasks throughout the whole workflow. Apply 
principles based on current knowledge about how to best elicit useful outputs 
from AI and/or continually question AI and experiment to reach a better output. 
For example:  
•
Assigning a persona: Instructing AI to simulate a specific type of
personality or character
