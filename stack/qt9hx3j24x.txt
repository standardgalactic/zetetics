Acknowledgments
At this moment when I complete my Ph.D. thesis during a rare rainy day in California, I
am very grateful for all I have received throughout ﬁve years at University of California,
Riverside. It has certainly shaped me as an Economics Ph.D. student to explore and
search scientiﬁc truth with curiosity. Simultaneously, it would be hardly possible for me
to thrive in my doctoral work without precious support of these persons.
First of all, I gratefully and sincerely thank my advisor, Dr. Marcelle Chau-
vet, Professor of Economics at University of California, Riverside, who enlightened me
through her wide knowledge of macro-econometrics, especially the application of Markov
Switching to the analysis of macroeconomic dynamics. It was only due to her valuable
guidance, enthusiastic suggestions, constant support and encouragement that I was ca-
pable to complete my research work. When I recall those scenes where she inspired me
with illuminating discussions on my dissertation in the midnights and holidays, where
she taught me how to appreciate fantastic scientiﬁc work and enjoy academic beauty
during the conference in Atlanta, where she listened to my rehearsal with patience for
several hours at her home before I went to the job market, I reaﬃrm that I was so lucky
and honorable to have her as my advisor during my PhD life. I would like to express
my appreciation to Dr. Chauvet for all the hope she has put on me and all her support
for my pursuit of scientiﬁc truth and life happiness.
I am also very grateful to my committee members Dr. Gonzalez-Rivera, Pro-
fessor of Economics at University of California, Riverside and Dr.
Ullah, Professor
of Economics at University of California, Riverside, for all their enthusiastic encour-
agement and help during my exploration to Econometrics and Time Series Analysis,
which in my view, is the most interesting ﬁeld in Economics. I would like to thank Dr.

Gonzalez-Rivera for her illuminating suggestions and comments on my job talk, for her
outstanding introduction of Time Series Analysis as well as for her useful training when
I worked as a graduate teaching assistant. I would like to thank Dr. Ullah for his ex-
traordinary teaching and guidance on my research towards empirical econometrics and
for his helpful training of referee reports to improve my academic experience and writing
skills. It was due to them that I conﬁrmed my research towards macro-econometrics.
Special thanks to Dr. Tae-Hwy Lee and Dr. Jang-Ting Guo, for all their generous help
and support during my PhD life. I am also thankful to all faculty members and the
ﬁnancial support in the Department of Economics at University of California, Riverside.
I would like to express my gratitude to my friends in the United States. With-
out them, I couldn’t survive through a tough PhD program and ﬁnally obtain a job
here. Especially I would like to extend my special thanks to Fang Bao, Dr. Jianlong

ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Bayesian Methods and Markov Switching Models for the Analysis of U.S. Postwar
Business Cycle Fluctuations

This dissertation consists of ﬁve chapters addressing analytically and empiri-
cally U.S. Postwar business cycle ﬂuctuations. Markov Switching models and Bayesian
estimation methods are used to investigate United States macroeconomic dynamics in
the last 60 years. Chapter 1 introduces the structure of this dissertation. Chapter 2
proposes a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with Markov Switch-
ing and heteroskedastic shocks to examine the role of agents’ beliefs separately from
changes in monetary policy in explaining inﬂation ﬂuctuations.
Bayesian analysis is
conducted with Markov Switching to support regime switches in the private sector, in
the implementation of monetary policy and in the volatility of shocks in the U.S. Post-
war economy, which are related to the “Great Inﬂation”, the “Great Moderation” and
the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. A counterfacutal analysis found that if agents maintained a
weak response to macroeconomic dynamics over time, there would be lower inﬂation
during the “Great Inﬂation”. In addition, irrespectively to monetary policy regimes,
supply shocks are the main driver of inﬂation ﬂuctuations, while demand shocks are the
main source of changes in the output gap. However, when agents maintain a higher
risk aversion towards consumption with a higher slope in the Phillips curve, demand
vii

shocks also play a role in driving inﬂation, even though supply shocks are still the main
driver of inﬂation. Chapter 3 emphasizes on the monetary policy with an investigation
on the assumption that policymakers commit to a Taylor rule, using a time-varying
inﬂation-unemployment dynamic model on U.S. economy. This chapter is based on the
conjecture that potential policymakers’ misperception may be originated from unob-
served deviations of unemployment from its natural rate. Five processes are proposed
for policymakers’ belief under commitment to inﬂation and unemployment and compare
them with a baseline autoregressive process without commitment. The models are esti-
mated using Bayesian techniques. Empirical results are as follows: First, policymakers’
belief is very persistent even when it commits to a Taylor-type policy rule. Second, the
run-up of U.S. inﬂation around 1980 can be mostly attributed to policymakers’ mis-
perception while the peak surge of inﬂation in 1974 is possibly a result of non-policy
shocks. Third, models with commitment dominate models without commitment, espe-
cially in periods of large oscillations in inﬂation. In particular, when policymakers are
committed to respond to a Taylor-type policy rule, the average loss function is consid-
erably reduced over time, thus eﬀectively lessening potential misperceptions. Chapter
4 introduces a simple version of adaptive expectation to a dynamic stochastic general
equilibrium (DSGE) model to evaluate the goodness of ﬁtness and forecasting perfor-
mance on U.S. macroeconomic indicators. Analytical maximum likelihood estimation
results represent a DSGE model with adaptive expectation outperforms a DSGE model
with rational expectation. In addition to providing a better ﬁt of inﬂation and output
gap in the U.S. Postwar macro economy, a DSGE model with adaptive expectation also
leads to redundant lagged inﬂation in ﬁtting inﬂation dynamics. Chapter 5 concludes
and proposes future extension.

Chapter 1
Introduction
U.S. Postwar business cycle ﬂuctuations and macroeconomic dynamics has been
studied extensively over 60 years. Recent research started from theoretical exploration
such as dynamic stochastic general equilibrium(DSGE) models to empirical investiga-
tion; from monetary policy analysis to exogenous, non-policy shocks observation; from
maximum likelihood estimation to Bayesian approaches. The common recognition of
previous literature is that United States postwar business cycle experienced three pe-
riods: the “Great Inﬂation” period, the “Great Moderation” period and our recent
ﬁnancial crisis starting from 2007 December. Simultaneously, arguments arise for the
explanation of sources resulting in “Great Inﬂation”, “Great Moderation” and 2008
ﬁnancial crisis as well as for important policy implication. This dissertation shows ana-
lytically and empirically further investigation on U.S. postwar macroeconomic dynamics
using Markov Switching approaches and Bayesian estimations.
The “Great Inﬂation”, the ”Great Moderation” and 2008 ﬁnancial crisis are
related to regime switches in the private sector, in the conduct of monetary policy and
in the volatility of shocks in the U.S. Postwar economy. Such a conclusion is represented
1

in Chapter 2. Chapter 2, “Regime Switching, Monetary Policy and Agents’ Beliefs in
U.S. Business Cycles” investigates the evolution of inﬂation and output dynamics in the
United States over the last 60 years. In particular, it proposes a dynamic stochastic gen-
eral equilibrium (DSGE) with Markov Switching and heteroskedastic shocks to examine
the role of agents’ beliefs separately from changes in monetary policy in explaining in-
ﬂation ﬂuctuations. The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques and results shed
light on the driving sources to inﬂation and output gap ﬂuctuations in the last 60 years.
How to avoid a large oscillation in inﬂation is also a critical issue in the “Great
Inﬂation” period. Chapter 3, “How Largely the Commitment can Beat Policymakers’
Misperceptions?” analyzes this question in a perspective of monetary authority. This
chapter investigates the assumption that policymakers commit to a Taylor rule, using a
time-varying inﬂation-unemployment dynamic model for the U.S. economy. Our model
is based on the conjecture that potential policymakers’ misperception may be originated
from unobserved deviations of unemployment from its natural rate. Five processes in
this chapter include a time-invariant Taylor rule in which policymakers can only observe
previous inﬂation and unemployment, a time-varying Taylor rule in which policymakers
adjust their commitment each period according to available information, a Taylor rule in
which commitment switches between high and low inﬂation and unemployment phases,
following a Markov Switching process, a Taylor rule in which commitment is changed
as a response to diﬀerent regimes in unemployment, a Taylor rule with commitment
adjusted according to low or high inﬂation regimes only. The models are estimated using
Bayesian techniques. Our empirical results shows policymakers’ belief is very persistent
even when it commits to a Taylor-type policy rule. In addition, the reason of peak surge
of U.S. inﬂation during 1974 and 1980 is also illustrated. With the measurement of
average loss, models with commitment are found to be superior to others.

Chapter 4 “Adaptive Expectations and Inﬂation Persistence” investigates in-
ﬂation persistence by proposing a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium(DSGE) model
with adaptive expectation. The proposed model is compared with a DSGE model in-
cluding rational expectation. Model ﬁt and out-of-sample forecasting show DSGE model
with adaptive expectation outperforms others. Findings are summarized in the conclu-
sion section of this dissertation, that is, Chapter 5.

Introduction
It has been extensively documented in the literature that the evolution of inﬂa-
tion and output dynamics is considerably diﬀerent before and after the mid 1980s. Such
distinct phases have been denoted the “Great Inﬂation” and the “Great Moderation”.
There is a current controversial debate on the sources of the diﬀerences across these
periods. Recent work has examined whether these diﬀerences are due to changes in the
structure of the economy or to changes in the size of exogenous shocks.
Following previous literature, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the
role of the private sector, the Federal Reserve, and the volatility of exogenous shocks
in explaining the dynamics of U.S. inﬂation and output over the last 60 years.
In
4

particular, it proposes a small scale Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model
(DSGE) with Markov Switching to investigate the role of agents separately from changes
in monetary policy - under homoskedastic or heteroskedastic shocks - in explaining
inﬂation ﬂuctuations.
The “Great Inﬂation” period in the 1970s was characterized by an upsurge
in inﬂation, accompanied by high volatility in the real and nominal sectors. Inﬂation
was brought to moderate levels in the early 1980s with a tight monetary policy by the
Federal Reserve under the chairmanship of Paul Volcker.
From the mid-1980s until
the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, the U.S. economy had been operating on a stable track with
relatively low inﬂation levels and unemployment rate, and a much more stable growth in
real output. Despite the fact that the economy experienced recessions in the early 1990s
and 2000s, these contractions were considerably milder and shorter than the previous
ones. The remarkable economic stability from the mid-1980s to 2007 was named the
“Great Moderation”. However, the meltdown in the U.S. housing sector spread to the
ﬁnancial system and to the real economy since 2007, with strong economic consequences
worldwide. This has led to a renewal interest in understanding potential underlying
causes of the changes in stability in the economic system across the last decades.
There is a large literature investigating the sources to the “Great Inﬂation” and
the “Great Moderation”. Some paper ﬁnds that the “Great Moderation” is the result of
a substantial change in the monetary policy under the Fed chairmanship of Paul Volcker
and Alan Greenspan such as Judd and Rudebusch (1998), Clarida, Gali, and Gertler
(2000), Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) and Boivin and Giannoni (2008), among others.
An alternative strand ﬁnds that the decline of inﬂation and output variability since the
mid 1980s is the result of reduced volatilities of exogenous non-policy shocks. Some of
the representative papers are McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), Stock and Watson
5

(2003), Cogley and Sargent (2005), Sims and Zha (2006) or Liu, Waggoner, and Zha
(2008), among others. In particular, Sims and Zha (2006) show that time variation in
structural disturbance variances is the main driver of the macroeconomic stabilization
during the “Great Moderation”.
More recently, there has been some important related research that develops
a methodology to estimate Markov Switching models under rational expectation. In
particular, Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha (2008)(FWZ) purposed a methodology to cal-
culate minimal state variable(MSV) solutions, and provided suﬃcient and necessary
conditions for their existence. Bianchi (2009), Liu, Waggoner, and Zha (2009), among
others, have applied this method to examine the sources of the “Great Inﬂation” and
the “Great Moderation” using a DSGE model with Markov Switching. On the other
hand, Davig and Leeper (2007) proposed a generalized Taylor principle that allows the
reaction coeﬃcients in the monetary policy rule to switch across regimes according to a
Markov process. Eo (2008) and Davig and Doh (2009) used this method to examine the
role of regime switching in explaining inﬂation ﬂuctuations, giving a micro foundation
interpretation.
In general, all the previous literature has focused on the role of changes in the
behavior of monetary policy under heteroskedastic shocks. This paper diﬀers from the
existing literature in that it investigates separately the changes in agents’ beliefs across
regimes to shed light on the role of changes in monetary policy, changes in the private
sector, or changes in the volatility of shocks in explaining the “Great Inﬂation” and the
“Great Moderation” phases.
The proposed Markov Switching DSGE model is considered under four assump-
tions 1. First, it is assumed that the response of household and ﬁrm (agents’ beliefs)
1Our small-scale DSGE model is comprised of an intertemporal Euler equation derived from house-
6

to economic ﬂuctuation may have changed over the last 60 years. In this case, only
the structural parameters of the Euler equation and the Phillips curve are allowed to
follow Markov regime switching processes, while the parameters in the monetary policy
function are ﬁxed. Second, changes in agents’ beliefs are considered under heteroskedas-
tic shocks to investigate the hypothesis that high inﬂation in the 1970s may have been
driven by larger exogenous shocks. In this case, two independent Markov chains are
considered to control the structural parameters and the disturbance variances. Third,
in order to capture changes in monetary policy separately from changes in the private
sector, only the structural parameters in the monetary policy function are permitted to
switch across regimes. Finally, it is assumed that the Federal Reserve faces shocks that
display stochastic volatility.
The methodology proposed in FWZ (2008) is used to obtain the model’s solu-
tion, which entails a VAR with time dependent coeﬃcients. The system is cast in state
space model and the Gibbs sampling combined with Metropolis-Hasting is used to solve
the system.
Four main ﬁndings stand out from the model estimation. First, our results
support regime switches in the private sector, in the conduct of monetary policy and in
the volatility of shocks in the U.S. postwar economy, which are related to the “Great
Inﬂation”, the “Great Moderation”, and the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis. During the “Great
Inﬂation”, consumers displayed a higher risk aversion to time variation in consumption
and preferred a more stable consumption path. Meanwhile, ﬁrms were adjusting prices
more ﬂexibly due to a lower adjustment cost, as represented by a higher slope in the
hold’s optimal decision on consumption and bond holdings, a Phillips curve describing a monopolistically
competitive ﬁrm facing a downward sloping demand curve for its diﬀerentiated goods, and a monetary
policy function depicting the response of monetary authority to the deviation of the inﬂation and output
from their steady states respectively. The model considers three diﬀerent exogenous shocks: demand,
supply (or technology shock) and monetary shocks.

Phillips curve. These observations lead to the conclusion that agents responded more
strongly to the economy in the 1970s. On the other hand, the Federal Reserve maintained
the output gap closed to zero at a cost of higher inﬂation in the 1970s, while this was
reversed from the 1980s on, with the Fed willing to accept a recession to keep inﬂation
low. In addition, the volatility of shocks was much higher during the “Great Inﬂation”
than that during the “Great Moderation”.
Second, the impulse response functions across diﬀerent regimes indicate that
when agents respond strongly to economic dynamics, ﬂuctuations in inﬂation and output
are much more accentuated.
Such an observation does not occur when the Federal
Reserve responds more strongly to inﬂation.
Third, the paper also ﬁnds that, irrespectively to monetary policy regimes,
supply shocks are the main driver of inﬂation ﬂuctuations, while demand shocks are the
main source of changes in the output gap. However, when agents maintain a higher risk
aversion towards consumption with a higher slope in the Phillips curve, demand shocks
also play a role in driving inﬂation, even though supply shocks are still the main driver
of inﬂation.
Finally, a counterfactual analysis ﬁnds that if agents maintained a weak re-
sponse to the economy over time, there would be lower inﬂation during the “Great
Inﬂation” period. On the other hand, if a hawk regime dominated the whole sample
with a strong response by the Federal Reserve to inﬂation, inﬂation ﬂuctuations would
be dampened in the 1970s, with the sacriﬁce of a reduced output gap.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2.2 brieﬂy describes Markov chains
and state space models.
Section 2.3 presents a benchmark DSGE model with ﬁxed
parameters and the proposed Markov Switching DSGE models. This section also reviews
the minimum state variable solutions (MSV) proposed by Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha
8

(2008).
Section 2.4 discusses the estimation algorithms. The estimation results and
analysis are presented in section 2.5, and section 2.6 concludes. The prior distribution
for the DSGE model parameters and a description of the DSGE model is provided in
the Appendix.

Understanding the dynamics of the U.S. postwar macroeconomic ﬂuctuation
has always been an important topic of economic research.
Some popular empirical
ways to investigate potential changes over time is to divide the sample into subperiods
based on some major policy changes or the tenure of chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The subsample method has the advantage that is easy to implement. Nevertheless, it is
subjective and exogenous to the model proposed, which has as drawbacks the possibility
of neglecting underlying unobservable factors for the possible changes. An alternative
is to allow for the possibility of endogenous Markov switching, governed by estimated
transition probabilities.
This method has become widespread both in empirical and
theoretical macroeconomic research since the seminar paper by Hamilton (1989). Below
we review some simple deﬁnitions of and applications of Markov chains, which serve as
the basis for the model proposed in this paper.
Deﬁnition 1 A Markov chain is an integer time process, {ξt, t ≥0} for which each
random variable ξt, t ≥1 is interger valued and depends on the past only through the
most recent random variable ξt−1. i.e., for all integer t ≥1 and all integer i, j, k, . . . , m,
Pr[ξt = j | ξt−1 = i, ξt−2 = k, . . . , ξ0 = m] = Pr[ξt = j | ξt−1 = i]
9

Pr[ξt = j | ξt−1 = i] depends only on i and j (not t) and is denoted by
Pr[ξt = j | ξt−1 = i] = pij2
A Markov chain in which each ξt has a ﬁnite set of possible sample values is a ﬁnite-
state Markov chain. Note ξt could be explained as the state of the chain at time t.
The possible values for the state at time t could be {1, 2, . . . , m} or {0, 1, . . .}3. pij is
the probability of going to state j given that the previous state is i. The new state
conditional on the previous state is independent of all earlier states. For example, a
four-state Markov chain with probability pi,j, i, j = 1, . . . , 4 can be described in ﬁgure
2.1, where pij represents the probability switching to state j from state i. p23 is the
probability of transiting into state 3 given that the previous state is 2. 4
A probability matrix that only takes into account changes from one state to
the alternative is deﬁned as a one-step transition probability matrix as following:
Deﬁnition 2 The matrix containing pij, the transition probabilities

is called the one-step transition probability matrix of the process.
2To distinguish P in the state space model, in the section 2.4, we will use H stand for the probability
matrix and pij as the transition probability.
3In this paper, we consider the state starting from 1 instead of 0.

Similarly, n-step transition probability matrix could be deﬁned as Hn = H × H × . . . × H

,
where when n = 1, Hn becomes one-step transition probability matrix.
The switching from one state to the alternative is not easily observed since
it requires observations of the underlying Markov chains. The hidden Markov mod-
els(HMM) are, thus, widely used. In a HMM model, there are two types of states: the
observable and the hidden/unobservable states. The detailed interpretation is enclosed
in the appendix.
The state space model is one of the tools that can be used to estimate the
unobservable states of hidden Markov models. The state space model starts with deﬁn-
ing a vector of real-valued observed series {Yt} under the assumption that observations
were generated from a sequence of hidden state vectors {St}, as represented in ﬁgure
2.2. It is assumed that given the unobserved St, the observation vector Yt is condi-
tionally independent from all other variables and St is conditionally independent from
S1, . . . , St−2.
The general state space model could be written as
Yt = D + ZSt + υt
(2.1)
St = TSt−1 + Rϵt
(2.2)
where υt ∼N(0, U), ϵt ∼N(0, Q). Equation (2.1) is deﬁned as the measure-
ment equation and Equation (2.2) as the transition equation. Figure 2.2 illustrates the
general state space model.
The combination of the state space model with hidden Markov chains can be
obtained by specifying a distribution over observations {Yt} and {St} at each time step
t given a discrete hidden state (Markov chain ξt), and the probability of transiting from
11

one hidden state to another. If there is only one unobserved state {St}, the Kalman
ﬁlter can be applied to calculate the maximum likelihood in its standard form. However,
when we have ξt that is aﬀecting St simultaneously, Kalman ﬁlter can not work directly
since now St is not unique. We use an approximation proposed by Kim (1994), which
basically combines the Kalman ﬁlter and Hamilton’s (1989) ﬁlter. The algorithm will
be introduced in the section 2.4.2 and for a detailed description of state space model see
Kim and Nelson (1998).
The combination of the state space model with a Markov chain and transition
probability matrix could also be represented by ﬁgure 2.3. 5
As observed, Yt depends on St and ξt. St is also aﬀected by an independent
Markov chain ξt. We will use this model embedded in a small scale DSGE model that
tracks the underlying shifting of monetary policy and agents’ beliefs.
2.3
A small scale DSGE model
This paper considers a popular prototypical New Keynesian monetary DSGE
model, which is tested by Lubik and Schorfheide (2004). The details about it could be
found in King(2000) and Woodford (2003).
2.3.1
Benchmark model: Fixed parameters
The benchmark model starts with ﬁxed parameters.
After log linearizing
around the steady states, a small scale DSGE model can be summarized by the fol-
5The model which is described by ﬁgure 2.3 is:
Yt = D + Z(ξt)St + υt
St = T (ξt)St−1 + ϵt

lowing three equations:
˜yt = Et[˜yt+1] −τ( ˜Rt −Et[˜πt+1]) + gt
(2.3)
˜πt = βEt[˜πt+1] + κ(˜yt −zt)
(2.4)
˜Rt = ρR ˜Rt−1 + (1 −ρR)(γ1˜πt + γ2˜yt) + ϵR,t
(2.5)
where ˜yt, ˜πt and ˜Rt are deﬁned, respectively, as output, quarterly inﬂation and nominal
interest rate. The tilde denotes percentage deviations from a steady state or, in the case
of output, from a trend path.
Equation (2.3) represents an intertemporal Euler equation derived from the
households’ optimal choice of consumption and bond holdings. Since the small scale
DSGE model considered does not include investment, output is proportional to con-
sumption, and the exogenous process gt captures the net eﬀects of these exogenous
shifts on the Euler equation. The parameter 0 < β < 1 is the households’ discount
factor and τ > 0 can be interpreted as the intertemporal substitution elasticity.
The inﬂation dynamics are characterized by equation (2.4) describing a con-
tinuum of monopolistically competitive ﬁrms facing a downward-sloping demand curve
for its diﬀerentiated product. Here the sticky price is due to quadratic adjustment costs
in nominal prices or a Calvo-style rigidity allowing only a fraction of ﬁrms to adjust
their prices. The expectational Phillips curve (2.4) has a slope κ, which corresponds to
a positive value for ˜yt in the boom.
The behavior of the monetary authority is characterized by a tradeoﬀbetween
inﬂation and output in the equation (2.5). The central bank adjusts its instrument to
deviations of inﬂation and output from their respective target levels by controlling a
nominal interest rate. The policy implementation error or the unanticipated deviation
13

from the systematic component of the monetary policy rule is represented by ϵR,t with
standard error as σR.
gt = ρgt−1 + ϵg,t
(2.6)
zt = ρzt−1 + ϵz,t
(2.7)
where we assume zero correlation ρgz between the innovations ϵg,t and ϵz,t with
standard deviation σg and σz.
The process zt in equation (2.7) and gt in equation (2.6) are assumed to follow
univariate AR(1) processes with coeﬃcients ρg and ρz. Note that zt captures exogenous
shifts on the marginal costs of production, and could be interpreted as a technology
shock. Similarly, gt summarizes changes in preferences or a time-varying government
spending, and can be considered as a demand shock.
The system could be solved using gensys.6 The linear rational expectations
model comprised of equations (2.3) to (2.7) can be rewritten in the canonical form
Γ0St = Γ1St−1 + C + Ψϵt + Πηt
(2.8)
where
St = [˜yt, ˜πt, ˜Rt, gt, zt, Et(˜yt+1), Et(˜πt+1)]
′
ϵt = [ϵR,t, ϵg,t, ϵz,t]

ηt = [(˜yt −Et−1[˜yt]), (˜πt −Et−1[˜πt])]
′

Gensys will return a ﬁrst order VAR in the state variable:
St = T(θ)St−1 + R(θ)ϵt
(2.9)
Where the vector θ collects the parameters of the loglinearized DSGE model
as:
θ = [τ, β, κ, ψ1, ψ2, ρR, ρg, ρz, σR, σg, σz]

To solve the unobserved variables such as gt, Et(˜yt−1), a state space model is
deployed to solve the law of motion of the DSGE model.7

7The benchmark model is closed to the one used in Lubik and Schorfheide (2004) and Bianchi (2009).
8Note that this vector autoregression will be singular so long as the number of shocks is less than
the number of variables in the system. Sometimes, it will also be singular even when the number of
shocks is equal to the number of variables. In order to reconcile the singular equilibrium from the model
with the clearly non-singular nature of the data, Diebold and Rudebusch (1996) suggested introducing
the errors in the measurement equation. In the technical part, we drop the solution when the vector

the DSGE model is calculated as ℓ(θ, σζ | Y T ).
2.3.2
Solving MS-DSGE model
A linear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with constant parame-
ters has limited ability in addressing changes in the dynamics of the economy. Parameter
switching linear rational expectation model is an extension that dates back to Hamil-
ton(1989, 1994). In an AR process described in these papers, a Markov chain with a
transition matrix can capture diﬀerent states of the condition mean, which can cap-
ture ﬂuctuations in the economic activity. The extended autoregressive representation
with constant state-independent parameters is extended by Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha
(2008) to solve the regime switching models with rational expectation.
The idea is
to compute a minimal state variable(MSV) solution to an expanded state space of a
Markov switching model. By writing an equivalent model with ﬁxed parameters in this
expanded space, the authors prove that when a unique equilibrium exists, it is in a
class of minimum state variable solutions. Their paper also provides the suﬃcient and
necessary conditions for the existence of the MSV solution. Based on these conditions,
they show equivalence between an MSV solution to the original model, and an MSV
solution to the expanded state space.
The calculation of a MSV solution and the solution method is outlined below
9.
autoregression is singular.

Let equations (2.3) to (2.5) be controlled by a Markov chain ξt as:
˜yt = Et[˜yt+1] −τ(ξt)( ˜Rt −Et[˜πt+1]) + gt
(2.10)
˜πt = βEt[˜πt+1] + κ(ξt)(˜yt −zt)
(2.11)
˜Rt = ρR ˜Rt−1 + (1 −ρR)(γ1(ξt)˜πt + γ2(ξt)˜yt + ϵR,t)
(2.12)
Thus equation (2.10) to (2.12) represent a Markov Switching Dynamic Stochastic Gen-
eral Equilibrium (MS-DSGE) model with some parameters ﬁxed and others following
Markov switching processes. A state space model covering equation (2.10) to (2.12)
could be represented as follows:

where ξt follows an m-state Markov chain. ξt ∈M ≡{1, . . . , m}. The Markov chain
evolves according to a stationary transition matrix H that deﬁnes the probability of
moving from one state to another as:
Pr[ξt = i | ξt−1 = j] = H = pij
In equation (2.13), n is the number of endogenous variables(n = 7 in this
case), k is the number of the number of exogenous shocks(k = 3), l is the number of the
rational expectations forecast errors(l = 2). The fundamental equations of (2.13) are
allowed to switch across regimes but the parameters Γ0,1, Γ1,1 and Π, which deﬁne the
non-fundamental shocks, do not depend on ξt.
17

To solve the equation (2.13), FWZ provides a pair of bounded stochastic pro-
cesses {St, ηt} such that it is consistent for all realizations of {ξt, ϵt}. We ﬁrstly rewrite
(2.13) to an expanded state vector St with ﬁxed parameters:

shocks. In their deﬁnitions, the switching shocks Ξξt(eξt−1 ⊗(1

oﬀthe appropriate blocks of the model to represent the Markov dynamics, while the
normal shocks eξt ⊗ϵt carry the fundamental errors that hit the structural equations,
distributed to the appropriate block of the expanded system.
They show that both
shocks have expectation equal to zero10.
Deﬁnition 3 A solution to Equation (2.14) is a stochastic process {St, ηt}∞
t=1 such that:
(1) {St, ηt}∞
t=1 jointly satisfy Equation (2.14).
(2) The endogenous stochastic process {ηt} satisﬁes the property, Et−1[ηt] = 0.
(3) St is bounded in expectation in the sense that ∥Et[St+s]∥< Mt for all s > 0.
In a MS-DSGE model the sunspot solutions are pervasive, and FWZ focuses
on a class of minimal state variable(MSV) solutions.
By introducing Φ, they prove
the equivalence between the MSV to the original model and the MSV to the expanded

ﬁxed coeﬃcient model.
To obtain a MSV solution, a matrix Z is deﬁned such that
Z
′St = 0. The introduction of Z considers the impact of diﬀerent regimes and makes
up the zero restrictions on the variables. Suppose regime 1 occurs, the third block of
equation (2.14) will impose a series of zero restrictions on the variables referring to
regimes i = 2 . . . m. These restrictions will constraint the corresponding element of St
to zero by incorporating with the one arising from the ﬁrst block of equations. If regime
i = 2, . . . m occurs, Φ will serve as a similar block of zero restrictions on regime 1. The
following deﬁnition of the unstable Γ0 and Γ1 is designed to lead up to a theorem that
enables us to compute Φ.
Deﬁnition 4 Let QSZ = Γ0 and QTZ = Γ1 be the QZ-decomposition of {Γ0, Γ1}.
Reorder the upper triangular matrices S = (si,j) and T = (ti,j) in such a way that ti,i/si,i
is in an increasing order. Let q ∈{1, 2, . . . m} be the integer such that ti,i/si,i < 1 if
i ≤q and ti,i/si,i > 1 if i > q. Let Zu, partitioned as Zu = [z1, . . . , zm] be the last nk −q
rows of Z. Beginning with a set of matrices {φ0
i }m
i=2 and generate the associated matrix
Γ0. Next, calculate Z0
u by computing the QZ decomposition of {Γ0
0, Γ1} and set φ1
i = z1
i .
Repeat this procedure until convergence.
If it converges, deﬁnition 4 implies that the solution {St, ηt} to equation (2.14)
is consistent with equation (2.13).
A VAR process can, thus, be written with time
dependent coeﬃcients as:
St = T(ξt, θ)St−1 + R(ξt, θ)ϵt
(2.19)
The law of motion of the DSGE states depends on the structural parameters
θ and the regimes ξt. Note ξt could follow a m-state Markov chain where m could be
20

greater than 2.
2.3.3
Alternative solution methods
There are alternative solution methods to a MS-DSGE model. Notice that
FWZ do not discuss the determinacy, but some other papers have addressed this issue.
Davig and Leeper (2007) and Davig and Doh (2009) map endogenous variables into
policy choices in terms of a generalization of the Taylor principle. Their solution method
makes use of the monotone map method, based on Coleman(1991).
The algorithm
requires a discretized state space and a set of initial decision rules that reduce the
model to a set of nonlinear expectational ﬁrst-order diﬀerence equations. They show a
condition that can rule out indeterminate equilibria in a version of the New Keynesian
model, where parameters of the policy rule follow a Markov switching process. A solution
consists of a set of functions that map the minimum set of state variables into values for
the endogenous variables. The solution method is discussed by Farmer, Waggoner, and
Zha (2008), who argues that this model suﬀers from an incomplete subset of fundamental
equilibria missed by their condition. Furthermore, at the stage local uniqueness of a
solution must be proved perturbing the equilibrium decision rules.
Another solution algorithm for a large class of linear-in-variable regime switch-
ing models is developed by Svensson and Williams(2005). Their method is closely related
to the class presented by FWZ. However, due to lack of a diagnostics for conditions of
a unique solution, their algorithm is considered to converge to a unique solution, to one
of a set of indeterminate solutions, or to an unbounded stochastic diﬀerence equation
that goes against the appropriate transversality conditions.
Bikbov and Chernov (2008) generalizes a method proposed by Cho and Moreno
(2006) for ﬁxed coeﬃcient New-Keynesian models to the case of regime switching dy-
21

namics. The solution proposed by Bikbov and Chernov (2008) is achieved by working
directly on the original model through an iteration procedure. They show in the case
of a unique stationary solution, their method delivers the same solution as obtained
with the QZ decomposition method. If the rational expectations solution is not unique,
the method yields the minimum state variable solution. It is not quite clear whether a
similar argument applies to the case with Markov Switching dynamics and how to check
if a unique stationary equilibrium exists.
Cho (2009) provides a technical foundation for a fairly general class of Markov
Switching General Equilibrium (MSGE) models by developing a conceptually straight-
forward and technically simple solution methodology to those models, based on the
forward method of Cho and Moreno (2009). They show a suﬃcient solution selection
criterion within the class of fundamental solutions, regardless of model determinacy.
We choose to apply the method proposed by FWZ due to its computation
eﬃciency. In addition, although the uniqueness of the MSV solution does not imply
uniqueness in a larger class of solutions, it provides necessary conditions to establish
existence and boundness of the minimum state variable solution. As for the problem
of indeterminacy/determinacy in a MS-DSGE model, this is a very complicated issue
that has not yet been solved in the literature.
Davig and Leeper(2007) proposed a
condition to rule out indeterminate equilibria. However, as Farmer et al(2008) shows,
their condition rules out a subset of indeterminate equilibrium but does not establish
uniqueness of the fundamental equilibrium.

2.4
Estimation Strategies
The solutions solved by FWZ on a small-scale MS-DSGE model return a VAR
with time dependent coeﬃcients. We combine the VAR with the measurement equation
that is cast in a state space form:
Yt = D(θss) + ZSt + υt
(2.20)
St = T(ξsa
t )St−1 + R(ξsa
t )ϵt
(2.21)
ϵt ∼N(0, Q(ξer
t )), Q(ξer
t ) = diag(θer(ξer
t ))
(2.22)
υt ∼N(0, U), U = diag(σ2
x, σ2
π, σ2
R)
(2.23)
Hsa(·, i) ∼D(asa
ii , asa
ij ), Her(·, i) ∼D(aer
ii , aer
ij )
(2.24)
where ξsa
t
is an unobserved state capturing the agents’ beliefs regime and ξer
t de-
notes an unobserved state that describes the evolution of the stochastic volatility regime
11. It is easy to estimate the likelihood of a state space model with ﬁxed parameters
using Kalman ﬁlter and then calculate the posterior combined with prior distribution,
using Bayesian methods. However, notice that in a MS-DSGE model, the underlying
DSGE state vector St is not unique given an observation for Yt due to the uncertainty of
the Markov state. Hamilton’s ﬁlter, which is usually used for evaluating the likelihood
of Markov Switching models, can not be applied directly here when Markov states are
not history independent. The probability controlled by a Markov state depends on the
value of St−1 and its distribution relies on {ξs}t−1
s=1.
However, if we can observe ξsa,T and ξer,T, the Kalman ﬁlter could be applied to
capture the distribution of St given Yt and it will be possible to return an unequivocal

state of St.
At the same time, if ST is now observable, then Hamilton ﬁlter could
be used to extract the probability of a Markov state. The Gibbs sampling algorithm
combined with Metropolis-Hasting, suggested in Bianchi(2009), is considered as one
way to calculate the posterior in a MS-DSGE model. However, Bianchi(2009) does not
address the case in which the solution does not converge. This paper follows Lubik and
Schofheide(2004), which assigns a very small likelihood in the absence of convergence so
that only converged solutions will be kept. Here we will still introduce Gibbs sampling
and Kim’s approximation in this section, as illustrated in Bianchi(2009).
Note that the posterior density function is non-Gaussian and complicated in
shape, it is very important to ﬁnd the appropriate posterior mode. We base our com-
putation of likelihood on Kim’s approximation(Kim (1994)) whose ﬁlter for the state
space model entails a combination of Kalman ﬁlter and Hamilton ﬁlter, along with an
approximation. The algorithm is illustrated in section 2.4.2.
The algorithm used here is as follows:
2.4.1
Gibbs sampling

n−1, θss
n−1,θer

n−1,Hsa

n−1 and Her
n−1, use Kim’s ﬁlter to get a ﬁltered estimate of the
Markov switching states and then use the backward drawing method to get ξsa,T
n
and
ξer,T
n
.
2. Given ξsa,T
n
and ξer,T
n
, draw probability matrix Hsa
n and Her
n according to a
Dirichlet distribution.
3. Draw ϑsa, ϑss and ϑer as new θ from the proposed distribution. Assign
a very small likelihood if the solution solved by FWZ doesn’t converge. The updated
24

parameters of θ are accepted or rejected according to a Metropolis-Hasting algorithm
with a probability min{1, r} where

In the algorithm described above, the likelihood is approximated when max-
imizing the posterior mode. The detailed algorithm is described in section 2.4.2 with
Kim’s approximation.
2.4.2
Kim’s approximation
In this section we describe Kim’s approximation of the likelihood function.
To simplify, we combine the Markov Switching states of structural parameters and of
heteroskedastic shocks in a unique chain ξt with m states. ξt could be explained to hold
m diﬀerent values with m = msp × mer, and evolves according to a transition matrix
H = Hsa ⊗Her with two independent Markov chains Hsa and Her. For a given set of
parameters, and some assumptions about the initial DSGE state variables and Markov
Switching latent variables, we can recursively run the following ﬁlter.

Empirical results
The section reports empirical results for ﬁve models considered. The ﬁrst one
is taken as a benchmark model with all parameters ﬁxed. The other four speciﬁcations
extend the constant parameters model to allow for underlying Markov switching pro-
cesses. The ﬁrst extension allows structural parameters of expectational Phillips curves
and intertemporal Euler equation to change across regimes according to the Markov pro-
cess ξsa
t . The second extension adds heteroskedastic shocks to the ﬁrst extension with
parameters and heteroskedastic shocks evolving according to two independent Markov
chains ξsa
t
and ξer
t . In the third extension, policymakers’ response to the inﬂation and
output gap in the Taylor Rule is assumed to switch in across diﬀerent regimes following
the Markov chain ξsp
t
whereas the last extension consider heteroskedastic shocks with
switching structural parameters controlled by two independent Markov chains ξsp
t
and
ξer
t . The ﬁve models are summarized by table 2.1.
The data used are from 1954Q3 to 2009Q2. The series are obtained from the
website of Federal Reserve of Saint Louis. Output gap is measured as the percentage
deviations of real per capita GDP from a trend obtained with the HP ﬁlter. Inﬂation is
the quarterly percentage change of the CPI(Urban, all items). Nominal interest rate is
the Eﬀective Federal Funds Rate.
27

2.5.1
Parameters estimates and regime probabilities
The DSGE model with constant parameters is taken as the start of the inves-
tigation on macroeconomic dynamics. The priors are speciﬁed according to those in the
previous literature, which are summarized in the appendix A.1. It is important to notice
that in the case of the ﬁxed coeﬃcient DSGE model, only when the Federal Reserve
reacts strongly to deviations of inﬂation from its target will this allow for determinacy.
In order to avoid the impact of indeterminancy, we restrict γ1 in equation (2.5) to have
a mean of 1.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5. This implies the central bank raises
the nominal rate by 1.5 percent in response to a 1-percent discrepancy between actual
and desired inﬂation. We set the prior of output gap targeting γ2 as 0.8 and interest
smoothing ρR as 0.7. The estimation of the benchmark model is reported in the table
2.2.
Over the whole sample, the Federal Funds Rate reacts strongly to deviations
of inﬂation from its target with γ1 = 2.17 while output gap receives less weight with the
coeﬃcient of 0.89. The coeﬃcient of the Phillips curve is estimated as only, k = 0.073,
which may imply a relatively ﬂat Phillips curve in which the ﬁrm faces a stickier price
in the good market. The inﬂation target in the benchmark model is 0.946, implying
a target for annual inﬂation around 4%.
τ = 0.419 represents the risk aversion of
consumers towards the time variation of consumption is around 212. The technology
shock is estimated as being much higher than monetary shock and demand shock.
There is a great interest in clarifying what happens when the consumers change
their attitude towards current consumption and the ﬁrms alter the rigidity or stickiness
of prices. Here I allow structural parameters τ and κ to switch across regimes evolving
12The risk aversion of consumers is represented by τ −1.
28

according to a Markov chain ξsa13. The transition matrix Hsa in this model used by
agents to change their beliefs is assumed to be a one-step transition probability matrix.
Table 2.3 reports means and 90% error bands for DSGE parameters and transi-
tion matrices when we have τ and κ switching across regimes, which corresponds to the
second extension proposed. In this model, the remaining structural parameters are kept
constant and the Federal Funds Rate is assumed with a strong response to deviation of
inﬂation from its target in order to obtain a determinacy solution 14. The estimation
indicates striking diﬀerences between two regimes. Regarding parameters of the private
sector, we observe that under regime 1 (ξsa
t =1), the household has a lower intertemporal
substitution elasticity with τ(ξsa = 1) = 0.121, which implies that the consumer is more
averse to variations in consumption and prefer a stable consumption path. That is, she
will be less willing to substitute consumption intertemporally. On the other hand, the
elasticity of output κ has a larger value under regime 1. A larger slope-coeﬃcient on the
output gap in the Phillips curve indicates that the ﬁrm is facing a more ﬂexible price in
the good market with a lower cost of price adjustment. Prices are considered more ﬂexi-
ble in the U.S. during the high and volatile inﬂation of the 1970 as discussed in Gali and
Gertler (1999), Cogley and Sbordone (2005), Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramarez
(2007). Figure 2.4 shows (ﬁltered) probabilities assigned to ξsa
t
= 1 takes place around
1958, during the “Great Inﬂation” and around 2008. Regime 1 is characterized as the
one in which agents respond more strongly to the economy. In this regime, agents have
a higher risk aversion and a steeper Phillips curve.
13Note Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000) mention that there is no widespread consensus on the value κ
and values found in the literature range from 0.05 to 1.22. To be consistent with Lubik and Schorfheide
(2004), I assume there are smaller τ and higher κ under the ﬁrst regime with potential larger volatility
at that time.
14An interesting thing is if we allow indeterminacy in the model 2, the regime 1 will be much wider
than my current result. Agents have to maintain their beliefs much longer if they accept a monetary
authority with passive monetary policy
29

In addition to switching in agents’ beliefs, we allow for heteroskedastic shocks
in the model. Structural parameters of the private sector and heteroskedastic shocks
are controlled by two independent Markov chains. Following Bollen, Gray, and Whaley
(2000), a convenient way to represent two independent Markov chains is to introduce a
four-state probability transition matrix. The process is described as follows:
Firstly, deﬁne ξsa as the agents’ beliefs switching regime with the probability
Pr[ξsa
t
= j | ξsa
t−1 = i] = pij, i, j = 1, 2 and ξer as the variance change regime with the
probability Pr[ξer
t
= j | ξer
t−1 = i] = qij, i, j = 1, 2. Both ξsa
t
and ξer
t
evolve according to
a ﬁrst-order one-step Markov scheme with transition matrix

for the variance regime. Now deﬁne a regime indicator variable that spans the regime
space for both agents variables and variance regimes as

The transition parameters p22 and q11 can be easily obtained from the above
transition probability matrix. Table 2.4 presents the results with two Markov Switch-
ing processes. The results in table 2.4 are similar to those in table 2.3 with a higher
τ and smaller κ under regime 1, and the opposite under regime 2. The diﬀerence be-
tween κ across regimes becomes slightly greater compared to the case with only agents’
beliefs changing. Another diﬀerence in this model is that the response of the Federal
Reserve to the inﬂation is much smaller– there is a lower inﬂation target. Regime 1
(ξer = 1) for heteroskedastic shocks is assigned higher standard deviation in the priors
of the model. The estimation results show a clear distinction between the two volatility
regimes. Similar to the model 1, technology shock is still the highest one.
The top panel in ﬁgure 2.5 shows that regime 1 of agents’ beliefs occurs around
1957, 1960, during the “Great Inﬂation”, and around 2008. The bottom panel repre-
sents the low volatility of shocks which takes place elsewhere except during the “Great
Inﬂation”, the early of 1990s, the early 2000s and around 2008. There is a reduction
in the size of exogenous shocks during the “Great Moderation” compared with other
periods. Note that the ﬁgure captures large shocks that hit the U.S. economy in the
last two years.
The next extension of the benchmark model investigated is the case in which
policy changes across regimes.
Table 2.5 reports the results when we have diﬀerent
31

regimes for policy parameters.
Under regime 1(ξsp
t
= 1), the Federal Funds Rates
react more strongly to inﬂation with γ1 = 2.17 while the output gap has lower weight
(γ2 = 0.758).
We deﬁne this as the “Hawk regime”, that is, the one describing the
situation in which the government reacts more than one-for-one to a change in inﬂation.
Similarly, when there is a smaller reaction of the Federal Reserve to inﬂation with
γ1 = 0.885, we have the alternative regime (ξsp
t
= 2) denominated the “Dove Regime”.
There are not great diﬀerences between coeﬃcients on output gap across the regimes.
The behavior of the Federal Reserve is mainly reﬂected by a change of response to
inﬂation. Figure 2.6 shows the probability of policy switching. The ﬁgure depicts a
passive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve from 1955 to 1958, from 1974 to 1980,
and from 2005 to 2008. There is a large literature showing evidence that during the
“Great Inﬂation”, policymakers were relatively unresponsive to deviations of inﬂation
from the target, following a loose monetary policy. On the other hand, during the Post-
Volcker period the Fed showed a stronger commitment to bring the economy back to
the steady state in order to achieve low inﬂation with a cost of reduced output.
In the last proposed extension, we assume that the Fed faces heteroskedastic
shocks. Compared with the case of only policy parameters switching, in this case these
estimates indicate that there is a slightly higher response to inﬂation and a smaller
inﬂation target over the sample.
The probability in the top panel of ﬁgure 2.7 represents the policy switching
regimes. It is well-known that the Federal Reserve accommodated the inﬂation around
the 1970s and started to raise the interest rate in the early year of 1980s. The interesting
thing is there were some changes before our current crisis - the estimates indicate that
Federal Reserve was following a loose monetary policy around 2005. The probability
of lower volatility over the sample is shown in the lower panel. A higher probability is
32

assigned to the period after the year of 1984. We also notice there was high volatility
of shocks around the 2007.
2.5.2
Impulse response analysis
Figure 2.8 shows impulse response functions to diﬀerent shocks. Since there are
four states, we plot the regime of high volatility and low volatility together in red and
blue, respectively. Thus, the ﬁrst two rows of ﬁgure 2.8 show the impulse responses to
a monetary shock under the strong response and weak response of agents, respectively.
Both output and inﬂation decrease following an increase in the Federal Funds Rate.
Under regime 1, output drops initially by almost 0.2 percent and inﬂation decreases by
0.3 percent to an unanticipated tightening of monetary policy. In this regime, agents
respond more strongly to keep the output gap close to zero at a cost of higher inﬂation.
The third and the fourth rows show the impulse responses to a demand shock.
Output and inﬂation increase under both regimes but are more volatile under the regime
1. In particular, the response of inﬂation is higher under regime 1 pushed by a demand
shock. It is easy to understand the movement by observing the ﬁrm will adjust the
prices more frequently when facing a demand shock.
The last two rows contain impulse responses to an adverse supply shock, i.e. to
an unexpected decrease in zt. The ﬂuctuation of inﬂation and output is stronger under
the regime corresponding to strong agents’ beliefs. This is also due to more ﬂexible
prices and stable consumption preference during this regime.
There is a larger literature that investigates the role of unfavorable supply-side
shocks as causes of the high inﬂation of the 1970s. Output decreases and becomes nega-
tive under both regimes, but at a larger extent under regime 1. Inﬂation ﬂuctuates more
in response to a supply shock under the regime 1 than regime 2. This result is similar
33

to Lubik and Schorfheide (2004). The conjecture that the 1970s were characterized by
important supply shocks is conﬁrmed by the variance decomposition in section 2.5.3,
discussed below.
Figure 2.9 summarizes the impulse responses to diﬀerent shocks when policy
parameters switch with heteroskedastic shocks for both high and low volatility regimes.
A positive monetary policy will reduce the output gap and inﬂation, and raise the
interest rate. The diﬀerence between the hawk and dove regime lies in the magnitude of
the response. The impulse response of inﬂation is lower in the dove region. The result is
consistent with the view that monetary policy is more eﬀective in an environment with
a low inﬂation target(Bernanke and Mishkin (1997), Mishkin (2007), Goodfriend and
King (2005)). As shown in Figure 2.9, a demand shock pushes output to a higher level,
and also generates a higher inﬂation. The responses are stronger under the Dove regime.
This is consistent with the response of the Federal Funds rate that is larger under the
Hawk regime. The dynamics of the variables are similar across two regimes, and thus
the Fed does not face any trade-oﬀwhen deciding how to respond to a demand shock.
A positive supply shock will increase the output gap under Dove regime and decrease it
under the Hawk regime. The result is also consistent with Bianchi (2009), who interprets
how the behavior of the Federal Reserve diﬀers across two regimes. Under the Hawk
regime the Fed is willing to accept a recession in order to control inﬂation. On the
contrary, under the Dove regime the policy response is much weaker because the Fed
tries to keep the output gap around zero, at the cost of higher inﬂation. If the expected
inﬂation is very high, a negative real interest rate will boost the economy in the short
run.
34

2.5.3
Variance decomposition
Variance decompositions for output gap, inﬂation, and interest rates are sum-
marized in ﬁgure 2.10, which represents contributions of structural shocks to the volatil-
ity of macroeconomic variables for all possible combinations of agents’ beliefs regimes
and volatility regimes. Such a decomposition enables better understanding of what kind
of shock contributes more in diﬀerent regimes. The ﬁrst two values, on the left of the
blue dashed line, refer to the high volatility regime, while the third and the fourth value
assume that the low volatility regime is in place. In each sub-group, the ﬁrst point
marks the standard deviation under the stronger reaction regime of agents’ beliefs and
the second point marks the agents’ weak response. The ﬁgure presents the variance
decomposition for four possible regime combinations. Output is mainly driven by the
demand shock, especially under the low volatility regime. We can note that change of
agents’ beliefs does matter in explaining the volatility of inﬂation. When the ﬁrm is
facing more ﬂexible prices, the inﬂation could be driven by the demand shock while at
the same time the supply shock still play a dominant role.
Figure 2.11 shows variance decompositions under switching policy parameters
and heteroskedastic shocks. Similarly to ﬁgure 2.10, the dashed blue line separates sub-
group as high and low volatility regime. The ﬁrst point in each sub-group refers to
the hawk region. As we can observe, in the case of output a large fraction of volatility
comes from the demand shock, especially under the Dove-High regime. Supply shocks
are mainly responsible for the volatility of inﬂation while monetary policy shocks play a
marginal role. Supply shocks explain more under the hawk region. When dove regime
is in eﬀect, the contribution of demand shocks is basically null. We arrive at the same
conclusion as the evidence from impulse response functions: under the Dove regime, the
35

Fed accommodates supply shocks to dampen the inﬂation. When we consider policy
switching, monetary policy shocks explain a small fraction of the Federal Funds Rate
volatility under hawk regime, considering the Fed has a stronger incentive to bring the
economy back on track.
2.5.4
Counterfactual analysis
This section implements counterfactual analysis in the extended regime switch-
ing models, in order to simulate what would have happened if regime changes had not
occurred. This kind of analysis brings us more meaningful interpretation in the context
of the MS-DSGE model. The entire law of motion changes in a way that is consistent
with new assumptions around the behavior of switching. Since we can observe diﬀerent
switching probabilities , we can investigate what would have happened if agents’ beliefs
or monetary policy about the probability of moving across regimes had been diﬀerent.
This has important implications for counterfactual simulations in which a regime is as-
sumed to have been in place throughout the sample because the expectation mechanism
and the law of motion are consistent with the fact that no other regime would have been
observed. By implementing counterfactual analysis, two main conclusions can be drawn
according to results of this section. First, inﬂation would be lower during the “Great
Inﬂation” if agents persist in a weak response with more sticky prices over the sample.
Second, if the hawk regime had been in place through the entire regime, a little would
have changed for the dynamics of inﬂation at the sacriﬁce of the production.
Two main conclusions can be drawn from the results of implementing counter-
factual analysis. First, inﬂation would be lower during the “Great Inﬂation” if agents
displayed a weak response with more sticky prices over the sample. Second, if the hawk
regime had been in place through the entire regime, little would have changed with
36

respect to inﬂation dynamics at the sacriﬁce of output.
Three analysis were undertaken in the counterfactual analysis.
Figure 2.12
shows the results when consumers always have a lower risk aversion and ﬁrms adjust
the price less frequently.
It is noticeable that if agents had always behaved in this
manner, inﬂation would have been lower during the “Great Inﬂation” period.
Figure 2.13 is the result under the assumption that the hawk region is always
in place. The higher interest rate in the 70s causes output to decrease slightly while
it is diﬃcult to curb inﬂation. In order to further study the behavior of the Federal
Reserve, we consider augmenting the policy parameters by doubling the values in the
Hawk region.
Figure 2.14 shows the results of this experiment.
In order to reduce
inﬂation, the Federal Reserve needs to react much more strongly, while at the same
time there is a risk of a recession.
2.5.5
Model comparison
This section reports the maximum likelihood of each model. As in table 2.7,
regime switching models display similar maximum likelihood values, while the DSGE
model with ﬁxed parameters displays a much lower one.
2.6
Conclusions
This paper investigates a small-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
model with regime switches on structural parameters. It extends the benchmark model
of ﬁxed parameters by considering the role of agents’ beliefs, changes in the behavior
of the Federal Reserve and the stochastic volatility of exogenous shocks.
A Gibbs-
sampling with Metropolis-Hasting algorithm is implemented as the estimation strategy
37

after solving the minimum state variable solutions. In an application to postwar U.S.
inﬂation and output dynamics, the results indicate that there were substantial diﬀerent
shifts in monetary policy, agents’ beliefs, and in the volatility of non-policy shocks in
the last 60 years. If the agents always maintain a weak response to economic dynamics,
inﬂation would have been lower during the 1970s. The more intense response to inﬂation
by the Federal Reserve would also have helped mitigate the great inﬂation.
Supply
shocks are found as the main drivers of the inﬂation if there were no switches in the
agents’ beliefs. Finally, there were substantial changes in agents’ beliefs, and in the
volatility of shocks in the recent years. Such an occurrence could be potential early
signals of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.

Chapter 3
How Largely the Commitment
can Beat Policymakers’
Misperceptions?
3.1
Introduction
Policymakers have a trade-oﬀon inﬂation and unemployment. This episode, is
described as “a discretionary policymaker can create surprise inﬂation, which may reduce
unemployment and raise government revenue” in Barro and Gordon (1983). The 1960s
to 1980s saw such an occurrence known as the “Great Inﬂation” while the following 26
years distinguished itself in a certain state of low inﬂation and shallow recessions named
as the “Great Moderation”. These stylized facts caused much interest which attempted
to explain the behavior of inﬂation and unemployment, especially the reason resulting
in the “Great Inﬂation”. Previous studies could be basically categorized as “bad luck”
view, “lack of commitment” view and “policy mistakes” view. While previous research
53

focuses more on the reason of inﬂation ﬂuctuation, our paper investigates how to allevi-
ate such a bad situation in the economy. Since it is diﬃcult to avoid bad luck originating
from exogenous and non-policy shocks, this paper aims to model the evolution of policy-
makers’ belief, which combines their commitment with policy mistakes. Results of this
paper demonstrate that a commitment to the Taylor-type monetary rule can eﬀectively
reduce policymakers’ misperceptions and thus contribute to a stabilization policy.
The source of “bad luck” is well stated as higher exogenous, non-policy shocks
occurring in the 1960s and 1970s. Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2002) stated that reduced
innovation variances resulted in largely decline in aggregate output volatility. Cogley
and Sargent (2005) achieved similar conclusion that innovation variances ﬂuctuated sub-
stantially larger in the late 1970s. Other research such as Kim and Nelson (1998), Sims
and Zha (2006) and Stock and Watson (2003) also supported the ﬁndings of greater dis-
turbances during the “Great Inﬂation”. The argument “lack of commitment” originates
from such a consideration that policymakers have no incentive to keep inﬂation low.
Barro and Gordon (1983) referred it as a “long-term contracts between the government
and the private sector”. This conclusion was also supported by research from Chris-
tiano and Fitzgerald (2003), Christiano and Gust (2000) and etc. Moreover, Bullard
and Eusepi (2005) assumed that monetary policymakers were committed to a Taylor-
type policy rule in a general equilibrium, sticky price economy and found a substantial
increase in inﬂation during the 1970s attributed to this source. The last explanation to
the “Great Inﬂation” is the “policy mistakes”, in which addresses U.S. monetary policy
was less responsive to inﬂationary in the 1960s and 1970s. Policymakers under the Fed
chairmanship of Arthur Burns failed to respond to inﬂation as appropriately as those un-
der Paul Volcker and Alan Greespan (for example, Boivin and Giannoni (2002), Clarida,
Gali, and Gertler (2000) and Orphanides (2002)). Primiceri (2005) found when policy-
54

makers underestimated both the natural rate of unemployment and the persistence of
inﬂation in the Phillips curve, a prolonged high inﬂation ending with rapid disinﬂation
will occur. Similarly, although Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2002) marked reduced inno-
vation contributed to the decline in aggregate output volatility, they admitted that good
policy played a more important role in explaining the post-1984 decline in the volatility
of inﬂation.
Our paper investigates the assumption that policymakers commit to a Taylor
rule, using an inﬂation-unemployment dynamic model for the US economy. Our ap-
proach diﬀers from previous work as we model policymakers’ belief as a latent variable
rather than as represented by observed nominal interest rate. Our paper is based on the
conjecture that policymakers’ misperceptions originate from unobserved deviations of
unemployment from its natural rate. We propose four processes for policymakers: belief
under commitment to inﬂation and unemployment and compare them with a baseline
autoregressive process without commitment. The models are: 1) a time-invariant Taylor
rule in which policymakers can only observe previous inﬂation and unemployment; 2)
a time-varying Taylor rule in which policymakers adjust their commitment each period
according to available information; 3) a Taylor rule in which commitment switches be-
tween high and low inﬂation and unemployment phases, following a Markov switching
process; 4) a Taylor rule with commitment adjusted according to low or high inﬂation
regimes only. 5) a Taylor rule in which commitment is changed as a response to diﬀerent
regimes in unemployment only. We specify a loss function derived from a constrained
minimization of the divergence in inﬂation and unemployment that also penalizes shifts
in the policy variables.
The models are estimated using Bayesian techniques. We ﬁnd that our esti-
mated belief performs the role of real interest rate. Our empirical results are as follows.
55

First, policymakers’ belief is very persistent even when it commits to a Taylor-type
policy rule. Second, the run-up of U.S. inﬂation around 1980 is mostly attributed to
policymakers’ misperception while the peak in the end of 1974 is possibly a result from
large non-policy shocks.
Third, models with commitment dominate models without
commitment, especially in periods of large oscillations in inﬂation. When policymak-
ers are committed to respond to a Taylor-type policy rule, the average loss function is
eﬃciently reduced over the time, thus eﬀectively lessening their misperception.
Results obtained from the proposed speciﬁcations illustrate the extent to which
diﬀerent commitments mitigate policymakers’ misperceptions given the loss function.
Our results have important policy implications as they indicate how and when it is
appropriate for policymakers to choose a commitment in their reaction to inﬂation and
unemployment. In particular, the models indicate that a ﬂexible or more activist policy
is more appropriate in reacting to inﬂation when there is high unemployment target,
whereas a policy that is consistent over time is more suitable under low unemployment
target. Moreover, our results shed light on the source of the two large rises in inﬂation
during the “Great Inﬂation” period and the prevalence of low inﬂation during the early
1980s.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 3.2 presents the theoretical model of
the evolution of policymakers’ misperception. Section 3.3 discusses how to estimate the
model in a Bayesian approach. Section 3.4 provides the empirical results and a model
ﬁt. Section 3.5 closes this paper with the concluding remarks.

3.2
Model the Policymakers’ misperception
3.2.1
The benchmark Model
We start from a simple rational expectation model that describes the dynamics
of inﬂation and unemployment in the private sector part. The inﬂation rate πt is equal
to inﬂation expectation Etπt+1, plus a component that depends on lag polynomial of
deviation of unemployment from its “natural rate”, ut−1 −uN
t−1,
πt = Etπt+1 + ˜θ(L)(ut−1 −uN
t−1) + εt
(3.1)
where εt is a random shock with the distribution of i.i.d. N(0, σ2
ε).
We assume policymakers’ misperception originates from the aggregate demand
equation. Policymakers adjust their belief based on the deviation of unemployment from
its natural rate. Equation (3.2) describes such a dynamic evolution as follows.
(ut −uN
t ) = ρ(L)(ut−1 −uN
t−1) + Vt−1 + ηt
(3.2)
Vt is a control variable of policymakers and ηt is a random innovation with
i.i.d N(0, σ2
η) distribution. The detailed description of Vt, as Primiceri (2005) is “unem-
ployment deviates from the natural rate either because of a random shock or because of
policymakers’ decisions about stabilization policy”.
The natural rate, uN
t , is assumed to ﬂuctuate over time in response to a shock
τt according to the autoregressive process 1
uN
t = γuN
t−1 + τt
(3.3)
1We ignore a constant term here to simplify the model.
57

where τt is serially uncorrelated and normally distributed with mean zero and
standard deviation στ.
Equation (3.1) to (3.3) describe the dynamic process of inﬂation and unem-
ployment augmented with a control policy variable. In the aggregate demand curve,
Vt−1 performs the role of real interest rate as the one it −Etπt+1. Vt−1 is also considered
capturing the joint eﬀect of monetary and ﬁscal policy.
A rational expectation is introduced in equation (3.1), which describes a dy-
namic process between inﬂation and unemployment, considered as a Phillips curve. In
our model, we assume that some agents are fully rational, while the rest of them form
their expectations adaptively.
Etπt+1 = (1 −˜α(1))Et−1πt + ˜α(L)πt−1
(3.4)
where ˜α(L) is a lag polynomial. By substituting (3.4) into (3.1), we can get a
backwarding Phillips curve as follows:
πt = α(L)πt−1 −θ(L)(ut−1 −uN
t−1) + εt
(3.5)
where α(L) = ˜α(L)/˜α(1) and θL = ˜θL/˜α(1).
Equation (3.5) captures the
inﬂation ﬂuctuation originating from a “cost-push” shock or the deviation from the
natural rate.
The policy-controlled variable Vt aﬀects deviation of unemployment from the
natural rate each period. Vt is chosen by policymakers based on available information,
that is, the inﬂation rate, the unemployment rate and their belief of last period.2
Policymakers are assumed to know the joint dynamic process of inﬂation and

unemployment very well.
They estimate the natural rate of unemployment and all
coeﬃcients in each period. Simultaneously, they respond to previous belief and adjust
it according to available information.
We assume policymakers follow a loss function derived from a constrained
minimization of the divergence in inﬂation and unemployment that also penalizes shifts
in the policy variables.
Et−1{(1/2)(ut −kuN
t ) + (b/2)π2
t + (1/2)(Vt −Vt−1)2}
(3.6)
where 1 ≥k ≥0 and b > 0. k = 1 could be taken as an eﬃcient criterion which
penalizes any departures of ut from uN
t . In this case, the target becomes the natural rate
of unemployment. k < 1 represent the possibility that the natural rate has intention to
exceed the eﬃcient level when there exists distortion. When k = 0, policymakers ignore
the natural rate of unemployment. In this situation, unemployment target disappears
and policymakers’ time-consistency problem becomes most powerful.
Many authors solve the problem of loss function by minimizing policy variable
such as Ireland (1999), Primiceri (2005), Reis (2003)) and among others. That is, when
we have a loss function as
min
Vt Et−1{(1/2)(ut −kuN
t ) + (b/2)π2
t + (1/2)(Vt −Vt−1)2}
(3.7)
subject to
πt = α1πt−1 + α2πt−2 −θ1(ut−1 −uN
t−1) −θ2(ut−2 −uN
t−2) + εt
(3.8)
59

and
(ut −uN
t ) = ρ1(ut−1 −uN
t−1) + ρ2(ut−2 −uN
t−2) + Vt−1 + ηt
(3.9)
Since Vt doesn’t enter directly into constraints, the functional form of Vt is
hard to express accurately.
At the same time, it is unrealistic for policymakers to
react to many coeﬃcients and variables in the solved form of Vt3. To distinguish from
other research, we investigate policymakers’ belief by ﬁrstly assuming they follow an
autoregressive process as
Vt = φVt−1 + ξt
(3.10)
where ξt is assumed as an i.i.d N(0, σ2
ξ). A state-space model covering (3.3),
(3.8), (3.9) and (3.10) could be written as
dt = CFt
(3.11)
Ft = AFt−1 + Bet
(3.12)
where dt = [πt, ut]′ and Ft = [πt, πt−1, ut, ut−1, Vt, uN
t , uN
t−1]′.
In this model, policymakers choose Vt based on previous belief Vt−1.
The
greater φ in equation (3.10) is, the more persistent policymakers’ belief is. If policy-
makers only respond to previous belief, equation (3.10) approximates a random walk
with φ close to the unity. φ is expected smaller when the policymakers synthesize more
information into their reaction equation. In the Phillips curve (3.8), θ1 and θ2 deter-
mine whether policymakers perceive a very costly inﬂation-unemployment trade-oﬀand
whether they would like accept a higher unemployment for a limited relief from inﬂation.
An autoregressive process in policymakers’ belief is obviously too simple to
3The optimized Vt in the equation (3.7) is policymakers’ previous belief Vt−1, however, to further
explore, Vt is actually aﬀected by (ut −uN
t ) −ρ1(ut−1 −uN
t−1) −ρ2(ut−2 −uN
t−2) −ηt.
60

model the complicated decision evolution. In addition to previous belief, there is lagged
value of inﬂation and unemployment that could be observed by policymakers. Based on
this information, we introduce ﬁve extensions in the following subsection.
3.2.2
Five Extensions
We ﬁrstly assume policymakers commit to a time-invariant Taylor rule. In this
commitment, policymakers can only observe previous inﬂation and unemployment4.
Vt = φVt−1 + (1 −φ)[απt−1 + δut−1] + ξt
(3.13)
Equation (3.13) represents policymakers can observe previous inﬂation and
unemployment, and thus adjust current belief based on them. Meanwhile, they are also
able to estimate the natural rate of unemployment corresponding to (3.8) and (3.9).
A more powerful commitment is a time-varying Taylor rule.
Policymakers
update their belief each period as follows:
Vt = φVt−1 + (1 −φ)[αt−1πt−1 + δt−1ut−1] + ξt
(3.14)
One hand, this commitment depicts a very quick response of policymakers
each period. On the other hand, a quick adjustment may lead to unstable performance
of monetary policy. Thus, except a time-varying commitment, we are also interested
in observing policymakers responding to inﬂation and unemployment across diﬀerent
regimes. The introduction of regime switching is considered as follows:
Vt = φVt−1 + (1 −φ)[αst−1πt−1 + δst−1ut−1] + ξt
(3.15)
4Since Vt is an unobservable variable. To distinguish parameters and latent variables, we only let
parameters on inﬂation or unemployment follow a time-varying approach or regime-switching.
61

where
αst−1 = α0(1 −st−1) + α1st−1
δst−1 = δ0(1 −st−1) + δ1st−1
st−1 = 0 or 1 represents regime 0 or 1 respectively. This means, under regime
1, policymakers’ belief is controlled by α1 and δ1, while under regime 0, it is reacted by
α0 and δ0.
One issue arises when we assume inﬂation and unemployment perform across
same regimes. Figure 3.1 shows the evolution inﬂation and unemployment from 1954Q3
to 2007 Q4. Inﬂation obviously performs a leading indicator compared to unemployment.
Such an stylized fact is captured by equation (3.16) and (3.17), which assume only
inﬂation or unemlpoyment switches across regimes.
Vt = φVt−1 + (1 −φ)[αst−1πt−1 + δut−1] + ξt
(3.16)
Vt = φVt−1 + (1 −φ)[απt−1 + δst−1ut−1] + ξt
(3.17)
Estimation results of ﬁve extensions from equation (3.13) to (3.17) will be
discussed in section 3.4.
3.3
Bayesian Estimation
This section describes the estimation method of Bayesian approaches.
A
state-space model covering equation (3.11) and (3.12) is estimated by a random walk
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In equation (3.11) and (3.12), matrices A, B and C are
62

functions of structural parameters ∆:
∆= [α1, α2, θ1, θ2, ρ1, ρ2, φ, α, δ, γ, σε, ση, σξ, στ]′
Then the likelihood of the model can be obtained via an application of the
Kalman ﬁlter
p(dt | dt−1, ∆) =
T
Y
t=1
p(dt | dt−1, ∆), t = 1, 2, ..., T
(3.18)
To simulate posterior distribution of the parameter, we reparameterize ∆as
∆∗. We draw ∆∗from speciﬁed distribution 5 and calculate the acceptance rate as
min

p(∆∗)p(dT | ∆∗)
p(∆(i−1))p(dT | ∆(i−1)), 1

(3.19)
where i = 1, 2, ..., N and N is the number of draws from the posterior distri-
bution of ∆.
In the regime switching model, transition probabilities are also calculated by
a Bayesian approach. We calculate posterior distribution as follows:
p(∆)p(sT | ∆)p(d | ∆, sT )
(3.20)
To solve p(sT | dT , ∆), we draw whole sequence from p(sT | dT , ∆) using
backward (in time) sequential partition sT ∼p(sT | dT , ∆). p(sT | dT , ∆) could be
calculated as
p(sT | dT , ∆) = p(sT | dT , ∆) ×
T−1
Y
t=1
p(st | st+1, . . . , sT , dT , ∆)
(3.21)
5The prior distribution is represented in Table 3.1 and 3.2
63

Given Markov property of unobservable variables, we have
p(st | st+1, . . . , sT , dT , ∆) = p(st | st+1, dt, ∆)
(3.22)
Using Bayes’ Theorem, the transition probability could be calculated as
p(st = i | st+1 = j, dt, ∆)
(3.23)
= pij × πi,t|t
πj,t+1|t
(3.24)
where pij = p(st+1 = j | st = i, ∆) and πi,t|t = p(st = i | dt, ∆). The ﬁltered
probability is calculated by iteration as
πj,t+1|t = p(st+1 = j | dt, ∆)
(3.25)
=
m
X
i=1
p(st+1 = j, st = i | dt, ∆)
(3.26)

(3.27)
=

X
i=1
pij × πi,t|t
(3.28)
and we update predicted probability by Bayes Theorem as follows
πj,t+1|t+1 = p(st+1 = j | dt+1, ∆)
(3.29)
= p(st+1 = j | dt, dt+1, ∆)
(3.30)
= πj,t+1|t × p(dt+1 | st+1=j,∆)
p(dt+1 | dt, ∆)
(3.31)
Time-varying parameter(TVP) model is similar to a Markov switching (MS)
model but unobservable variable is a continuous variable. The posterior simulation of
64

time-varying model is conceptually similar to that of Markov switching model: we draw
unobservable variables conditional on data and parameters, and draw parameters given
data and unobservable variables.
Since we have
Vt = φVt−1 + (1 −φ)[αt−1πt−1 + δt−1ut−1] + ξt
We assume varying parameters follow a random walk with error terms
αt = αt−1 + εα
t
(3.32)
δt = δt−1 + εδ
t
(3.33)
where εα
t ∼N(0, Hα) and εδ
t ∼N(0, Hδ).
Let ˜β = [α, δ]′, we follow Carter and R.Hohn (1994) and factorize the full
conditional posterior distribution of the state vectors belonging to the sample period as:
p( ˜
βT | dT , ∆) = p( ˜
βT | dT , ∆)
T
Y
t=1
( ˜βt | dT , ∆)
(3.34)
By iteration, we have
˜βt+1 = ˜βt+1|t + et+1|t
(3.35)
= ˜βt+1|t + et|t
(3.36)
where et|t is simulated each time based on extracted variables by Kalman ﬁlter and the
acceptance rate of equation (3.19).

3.4
Empirical Results
The section represents empirical results of our model. Quarterly changes in
seasonally adjusted GDP deﬂator, converted as 400 ∗log(Pt/Pt−1), serve to measure
inﬂation. The seasonally adjusted civilian unemployment rate averaged over each three
months is taken as quarterly unemployment rate here. The whole sample is from 1954:Q3
to 2007:Q4.
In this section, we compare and investigate diﬀerent assumptions of policy-
makers’ misperception, estimated by a Bayesian approach. Four main conclusions are
obtained: ﬁrst, policymakers’ misperception is very persistent, even though it commits
to a Taylor rule.
Second, policymakers’ misperception was observed highest around
1979. The run-up of U.S. inﬂation around 1980 is mostly attributed to policymakers’
misperception while the peak in the end of 1974 is possibly a result from large non-policy
shocks. Severe oil shocks could be considered as one of main reasons resulting in ﬁerce
inﬂation ﬂuctuation in 1974. Third, models with commitment dominate models with-
out commitment, especially in periods of large oscillations in inﬂation. Over the whole
sample, the time-invariant commitment can reduce policymakers’ misperception highest
to 8.5%. The time-varying commitment can reduce much more when there is a high
target on unemployment. Policymakers are expected to keep consistent with a commit-
ment to the Taylor rule, especially in periods of large inﬂation ﬂuctuation. Last, we
subtract misperception from nominal interest rate. The left component is quite similar
to Survey of Professional Forecasters(SPF) that underestimates inﬂation in the 1970s
while overestimates inﬂation in the 1980s and 1990s. The estimation of policymakers’
misperception in our model, captures the characteristics of the real interest rate.
Table 3.1 and 3.2 represents Bayesian estimations of the model without com-
66

mitment and with time-invariant commitment6.
As observed, the estimated natural
rate of unemployment and policymakers’ misperception are very persistent since φ and
γ are quite close to the unity. γ in the model without commitment is slightly greater
than that of time-invariant commitment. Other estimated parameters are similar al-
though diﬀerence is observed. For both models, α1 is slightly greater than α2 and θ1,
which demonstrates inﬂation responds more to the last period inﬂation instead of unem-
ployment. However, a large estimate of θ2 reveals that inﬂation was greatly inﬂuenced
by unemployment in the last two period. Such a observation conﬁrms that inﬂation
performs as a leading indicator in U.S. economy. In the IS curve, the dynamics of un-
employment originates more from the previous period since we have a greater estimate
of ρ1. Moreover, in our estimation, demand shock in the Phillips curve dominates other
shocks.
Table 3.3 reports average loss over the whole sample from 1954:Q3 to 2007:Q4.
We compute diﬀerent average loss given diﬀerent b and k. When k is as small as 0.5,
there is no big diﬀerence between models without commitment and with commitment.
If policymakers choose to put less weight on the target of unemployment, it won’t hurt
them much without commitment.
However, in previous literature, k was estimated
more than 0.8 (for instance, Barro and Gordon (1983), Primiceri (2005)).
When k
is greater than 0.8, it means a slight departure of ut from uN
t
will be penalized. As
we can observe in table 3.3, a commitment to a Taylor rule will help policymakers
reduce their loss eﬀectively. Models with time-varying commitment as well as Markov
switching commitment perform the best. Compared to the model without commitment,
model with Markov switching on inﬂation will decrease average loss over 25%. Table
3.6 summarizes maximum likelihood for all proposed models. Among them, model with
6More results are available upon request.
67

time-varying commitment returns the largest maximum likelihood.
We also investigate estimation in diﬀerent subsamples. Results are represented
in table 3.4 and 3.5 respectively. Table 3.4 represents results of Pre-Volcker period from
1954:Q3 to 1979:Q4 whereas table 3.5 represents results of Post-Volcker period from
1980:Q1 to 2007:Q4. Average loss in table 3.5 in comparison to table 3.4 is smaller in
the Post-Volcker period. Such a result comes not only from low inﬂation rate in the Post-
Volcker period but also from less deviation from natural rate of unemployment. Models
with time-varying commitment and Markov switching commitment still dominate others
when k is over 0.8 in both subsamples. Similarly, we can observe when policymakers
respond ﬂexibly to inﬂation, the average loss will be reduced more than 35% during Post-
Volcker period. When k is equal to 0.5, that is, when policymakers have a low target
of unemployment, it is diﬃcult for model with commitment to beat model without
commitment.
Figure 3.2 and 3.3 depict the misperception of policymakers in diﬀerent mod-
els in comparison with inﬂation and unemployment. During periods of large oscillations
in inﬂation and unemployment, misperceptions from models with time-varying com-
mitment and Markov switching commitment are obviously smaller than others. When
inﬂation rate is low, there is no big diﬀerence between diﬀerent models. We also note
that during the “Great Inﬂation” period, misperception around 1979 is greater than
that around 1974. Obviously, policymakers’ misperception could not completely inter-
pret the high peak in 1974. The run-up of U.S inﬂation around 1979 is mostly attributed
to policymakers’ misperception while the peak in the end of 1974 is possibly a result
from large non-policy shocks such as oil shocks.
Figure 3.4 analyze misperception in comparison with interest rate. The re-
lationship between nominal interest rate it, inﬂation πt and real interest rate rt is as
68

follows:
it −πt = rt
Then inﬂation could be represented as
πt = it −rt
The eﬀective federal funds rate averaged over each three months is taken as
quarterly nominal interest rate it and we model inﬂation as it −Vt, that is, interest
rate subtracts misperception.
The modeled inﬂation with interest rate is plotted in
ﬁgure 3.4 and compared with SPF. As we can observe, in a model without considering
interest rate, the modeled inﬂation is very similar to SPF, which underestimates inﬂation
around 1974, catches the peak in the 1979 and overestimates in the 1980s. The predicted
misperception in our model actually performs the role of real interest rate.
Figure 3.5 shows a model ﬁt of inﬂation and unemployment. Our model pro-
vides a better ﬁt for unemployment.
3.5
Concluding Remarks
There is always a trade-oﬀbetween inﬂation and unemployment faced by poli-
cymakers. They expect to have a stable economy without violent ﬂuctuation on inﬂation
and unemployment in the world. During their reaction to inﬂation and unemployment,
it is unavoidable for policymakers to make mistakes. Thus, how to avoid serious mistakes
is proceeded to the agenda. Our models demonstrate that policymakers should commit
to a Taylor rule, which in a large extent, can prevent them from serious mistakes. In
69

addition, our results have important policy implications as they indicate how and when
it is appropriate for policymakers to choose a commitment in their reaction to inﬂation
and unemployment. Our models indicate that a ﬂexible or more activist policy is more
appropriate when there is high unemployment target while a more consistent policy is
more suitable under low unemployment target. The distinguished interpretation on two
large rises in inﬂation in 1974 and 1979 also contributes to the investigation of sources
to the “Great Inﬂation”.

Chapter 4
Adaptive Expectations and
Inﬂation Persistence
4.1
Introduction
In the literature, the most common way to relax rational expectations is to
assume that agents learn about parameters using constant gain, least squares learn-
ing and then predict future variables with estimated parameters. In particular, Milani
(2007) estimated a DSGE model by assuming that agents behave as econometricians to
forecast future inﬂation and output gaps with the reduced form of an economic model,
and learn the reduced form parameters over time. This paper deviates from this model
of learning by employing the simple adaptive expectations proposed by Cagan (1956), in
which expectations evolve by correcting errors in the expectations themselves. We pro-
pose a small-scale DSGE model with a simple version of adaptive expectations (see, e.g.,
Cagan, 1956) to evaluate the goodness of ﬁtness and forecasting performance. Adaptive
expectations allow us not only to estimate the DSGE model directly without solving
rational expectation problems, but also to estimate inﬂation and output expectations,
80

since expectations can be treated as state variables in our model. Estimation is imple-
mented by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
Our results indicate that estimated expectations outperform VAR forecasts
in forecasting future inﬂation and output gaps. Furthermore, estimated expectations
appear to perform very well even though we assume that agents formulate their expec-
tations based on their imperfect and naive knowledge about the true economy. We show
that replacing rational expectations with adaptive expectations leads to an increase in
likelihood, supporting our learning over the rational expectations model in ﬁtting the
U.S. data.
This paper also investigates whether adaptive expectations could replace the
role of lagged inﬂation or output gap with respect to persistence. The purely forward-
looking new Keynesian models are well known for their failure to generate persistence in
the key macroeconomic variables. For example, Gali and Gertler (1999) and Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) incorporate lagged inﬂation into the Phillips curve to
generate persistence as well as to improve the goodness-of-ﬁt of inﬂation dynamics. To
incorporate a lagged inﬂation term into the Phillips curve, they assume that a fraction
of ﬁrms adjust their prices by automatic indexation to the past period’s inﬂation rate.
For output gap persistence, habit in consumption, as proposed by Fuhrer and Moore
(1995), is often used to incorporate a lagged output gap term into the IS curve in a model
economy. However, it is still controversial whether lagged inﬂation and output gap terms
are necessary to generate persistence in the Keynesian models. In particular, Sbordone
(2005) favors the purely forward-looking Phillips curve in terms of its goodness-of-ﬁt.
Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2009) doubt the hybrid new Keynesian Phillips curve
due to its failure to provide micro-foundations. Milani (2007) examines this issue within
a DSGE model allowing agents to learn about parameters in the reduced form of a
81

DSGE model, and concludes that indexation and habit formation are redundant. We
investigate this issue and ﬁnd that adaptive expectations could limit the role of lagged
inﬂation in ﬁtting inﬂation dynamics. But a lagged output gap term turns out to be
necessary even after the introduction of adaptive learning.
Simulations show that our model generates plausible responses to demand,
cost-push and interest rate shocks. We introduce expectations shocks to the model,
which can aﬀect inﬂation and the output gap. One of the important features in the
survey of inﬂation expectations reﬂecting people’s beliefs is that expectations lag behind
variables.
Our simulation results demonstrate that the lag-behind property can be
generated by adaptive learning.
The contents of the paper are as follows. Section 4.2 investigates the hybrid new
Keynesian Phillips curve under adaptive expectations. Section 4.3 sets up a DSGE model
under learning and examines the issues of inﬂation and output persistence. In Section
4.4, we evaluate the goodness-of-ﬁt of DSGE models under adaptive expectations and
rational expectations. Section 4.4 also presents estimation results of the DSGE model
with respect to inﬂation and output persistence. We evaluate forecasting performance in
terms of the root mean squared error. Section 4.5 provides impulse response functions.
The last section concludes the paper.
4.2
Inﬂation Expectations and Inﬂation Persistence
The new Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) relates current inﬂation to both
the output gap and inﬂation expectations in a proﬁt-maximizing framework featur-
ing staggered price contracts and forward-looking behavior in price-setting. However,
the NKPC is often criticized due to its inability to generate inﬂation persistence, and
82

therefore costly disinﬂation. In response to this challenge, Gali and Gertler (1999) and
Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005) try to correct this failure of the NKPC by
adding a lagged inﬂation term to the model. They incorporate lagged inﬂation into
the NKPC by assuming that a fraction of ﬁrms adjust their prices by rule-of-thumb or
automatic indexation to the past period’s inﬂation rate. The hybrid NKPC, derived by
assuming that there are two types of agents, forward- and backward-looking agents, is
of the form
πt = µπEtπt+1 + (1 −µπ)πt−1 + λyt + επ
t ,
(4.1)
where πt and yt denote inﬂation and the output gap, and επ
t represents the cost-push
shock, which has heteroskedasticity, επ
t |Ωt−1 ∼N(0, h2
t ). We model time-varying vari-
ance with GARCH(1,1), of the form
ht = α1 + α2(επ
t−1)2 + α3ht−1.
(4.2)
The use of lagged inﬂation to generate inﬂation persistence is still controversial in terms
of its goodness-of-ﬁt and micro-foundations. After investigating the closed-form solution
of the purely forward-looking Phillips curve, Sbordone (2005) concludes that lagged
inﬂation is not necessary for the goodness-of-ﬁt. Gali and Gertler (1999) report that
lagged inﬂation plays a limited role in accounting for inﬂation dynamics. In addition,
Woodford (2007), Rudd and Whelan (2007), Cogley and Sbordone (2008), Benati (2008),
and Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2009) consider the addition of lagged inﬂation to the
Phillips curve by indexation or by rule-of-thumb to be an ad hoc solution. The source
of the inﬂation persistence remains open to question. This paper explores whether a
simple version of adaptive expectations is able to replace the role of lagged inﬂation in
83

explaining inﬂation dynamics. When we set Etπt+1 ≡βπ
t for the state space model,
then the adaptive learning is of the form
βπ
t = βπ
t−1 + ˜απ(πt−1 −βπ
t−1) + ωπ
t ,
(4.3)
where ωπ
t ∼N(0, σ2
ωπ). We denote by ωπ
t the expectation shock. In correcting forecast
errors to formulate inﬂation expectations, we use lagged inﬂation rather than current
inﬂation in this section, as current inﬂation may not be observed (see, e.g., Sargent,
Williams, and Zha (2009)). On the other hand, one may object to using lagged inﬂation
and prefer current inﬂation in correcting errors (see, e.g., Evans and Ramey (2006)).
For this reason, we also adopt current inﬂation to correct forecast errors in the next
section.
We construct a state-space model, because the path of inﬂation expectations is
not observed. One of the convenient features of adaptive expectations is that they allow
us to estimate both inﬂation expectations and model parameters directly, by using the
Kalman ﬁlter. In estimating the model, we assume that επ
t follows GARCH(1,1). The
state space model can be written as follows:
πt = [µπ

When we assume that agents formulate their expectations using adaptive learning rather
than rational expectations, we can estimate the hybrid NKPC and the path of inﬂation
expectations using the state space model in Equations (4.4) and (4.5). For the estima-
84

tion, we use the Congressional Budget Oﬃce (CBO) output gap measure. The output
gap is deﬁned as the percentage deviation of real GDP from potential output as mea-
sured by the Congressional Budget Oﬃce. The implicit GDP deﬂator is adopted to
calculate the inﬂation rate.
Table 4.1 displays the maximum likelihood estimation results. The coeﬃcient
associated with inﬂation expectations is estimated to be around 1. This result suggests
that adaptive expectations make the role of lagged inﬂation unnecessary in explaining
inﬂation dynamics. The ﬁnding thus indicates that inﬂation persistence may result from
adaptive expectations rather than lagged inﬂation. The value of ˜απ is estimated to be
0.60, with standard error, 0.06, suggesting that the learning model is supported by the
data. The estimates of α2 and α3 are also signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero, supporting
heteroskedasticity in the error term of the Phillips curve.
Figure 4.1 displays inﬂation expectations from the Survey of Professional Fore-
casters (SPF), realized one-quarter-ahead inﬂation and estimated inﬂation expectations
from the state space model. Estimated inﬂation expectations seem to provide a good
approximation of people’s beliefs about future inﬂation that are observed from the SPF.
Estimated inﬂation expectations capture the well-known feature that the observed inﬂa-
tion expectations “lag behind” inﬂation. This behavior is clearly observed in the 1970s
and the early 1980s, when inﬂation was changing drastically. The second ﬁgure presents
the heteroskedasticity, which is measured by GARCH(1,1). The uncertainty of inﬂation
started to increase in the early 1970s and was staying continuously high by the early
1980s.

4.3
A DSGE model under adaptive expectations
This section introduces a small-scale DSGE model under adaptive expectations.
We employ Equation (4.1) for the Phillips curve, but assume that the cost-push shock
follows a ﬁrst order autoregressive process, επ
t = δπεπ
t−1 + vπ
t , as in the literature, and
that vπ
t is N(0, σ2
π).
We employ the same adaptive expectations shown in Equation
(4.3), but we replace the lagged inﬂation with current inﬂation, assuming that economic
agents adjust their expectations using current inﬂation rather than lagged inﬂation. We
employ the IS curve of the form
yt = µyEtyt+1 + (1 −µy)yt−1 −σ(it −Etπt+1) + εy

The baseline IS curve, as a special case (µy = 1) of Equation (4.6) derived from a utility-
maximization problem, is able to generate a “jump” in the output gap in response to a
change in the expected future output gap while output gap measures are persistent. As
addressed by Fuhrer (2000), this problem can be cured by the inclusion of habit forma-
tion in consumption. It plays an important role in incorporating a lagged output gap
term in the IS curve as a source of output persistence. Empirical studies of DSGE models
under rational expectations have often reported signiﬁcant degrees of habit formation in
consumption (e.g., Smets and Wouters (2007) and Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans
(2005)). On the other hand, Milani (2007) provides empirical evidence that allowing
agents to learn about parameters makes habit formation redundant. In this respect, we
reinvestigate whether Cagan’s adaptive expectations mechanism is able to replace the
role of habit formation in consumption. Adaptive expectations for the output gap take

the form
βy
t = βy
t−1 + ˜αy(yt −βy
t−1) + ωy
t ,
(4.7)
where Etyt+1 ≡βy
t . Equations (4.3) and (4.7) impose dynamics in expectations
and therefore allow us to treat expectations as state variables, so we can directly estimate
expectations without solving rational expectation problems.
We assume that ωπ
t is
N(0, σ2
ωπ).
We adopt a monetary policy rule of the form,
it = ρit−1 + (1 −ρ)(αππt + αyyt) + εi
t,
(4.8)
where the interest rate shock follows an AR(1) process, εi
t = δiεi
t−1 + vi
t, and vi
t ∼
N(0, σ2
i ). The coeﬃcient associated with the lagged nominal interest rate measures the
degree of smoothing in monetary policy. The Taylor rule shows that the nominal interest
rate adjusts in response to economic activity and inﬂation.
The state-space form can be written as
dt = CSt
(4.9)
St = ASt−1 + Bet,
(4.10)
where dt = [πt, yt, it]′ and st = [πt, yt, it, Etπt+1, Etyt+1, επ

model under rational expectations, in which the parameters of the model are included
in the following vector, ΘRE={λ, µπ, µy, σ, ρ, απ, αy, σπ, σy, σi, δπ, δy, δi}.

Empirical Results
This section presents the estimates of the DSGE model under adaptive expec-
tations. Our data, covering the time period from 1954Q3 to 2007Q4 includes inﬂation,
the CBO output gap and the interest rate. The eﬀective federal funds rate is adopted
for the interest rate.
For comparison, Table 4.2 reports the estimates of the DSGE model under both
rational expectations and adaptive expectations.
The results are obtained using the
maximum likelihood estimator.1 The ﬁndings indicate that the coeﬃcient on inﬂation
expectations in the learning model is approximately 0.89, which reveals that the role
of lagged inﬂation is quite limited in explaining inﬂation dynamics. Compared to the
estimate of µπ from Section 4.2, the coeﬃcient appears to be lower. However, both
results suggest that a lagged inﬂation term is not important when adaptive expectations
are introduced.
Turning to the rational expectations model, the coeﬃcient (µπ) on
inﬂation expectations is estimated to be 0.74, which is lower than the estimate from the
learning model. The estimated coeﬃcient is consistent with the ﬁndings of Gali and
Gertler (1999).2 On the other hand, a model introduced by Christiano, Eichenbaum,
and Evans (2005) implies that this coeﬃcient is closer to 0.5. In the learning model,
a higher estimate of µπ reveals that the lagged inﬂation intended to generate inﬂation
persistence could be replaced with adaptive learning.
The estimates of µy from the learning and rational expectations models are
very similar, which implies that the role of the lagged output gap is still necessary in
generating persistence. That is, the introduction of adaptive learning does not make the
1Table 4.1 and 4.2 are estimates of the model without inﬂation targets. We also check the estimation
results of the model with inﬂation targets in the Taylor rule. Although we do not report, estimation
results are similar.

lagged output gap unnecessary. Habit formation in consumption seems to be required to
generate output gap persistence. This ﬁnding is diﬀerent from that of Milani (2007). In
his model, in which agents forecast future variables using the reduced form of a DSGE
model and learn about the reduced form parameters over time, a lagged output gap
term is reported to be redundant in generating persistence. In our model, the role of
adaptive output gap expectations does not seem to be suﬃcient, on the grounds that
the estimated coeﬃcient ˜αy measuring the speed of correcting errors is not statistically
signiﬁcant.
Therefore, the expectations are modeled as a random work process.
In
contrast to the estimate of ˜αy, the estimated value of ˜
απ is statistically signiﬁcant and
robust to the model speciﬁcations, that is, in both the DSGE model and the Phillips
curve.
For the monetary policy parameters, the parameter estimate of ρ capturing the
degree of interest rate smoothing is 0.92. Under the assumption of rational expectations,
the coeﬃcient on lagged interest rate is estimated to be 0.68. This parameter is often
reported to be around 0.75 in the literature (e.g., Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000)).
The coeﬃcient on inﬂation expectations in the Taylor rule is estimated to be 1.67 for
the adaptive learning and 1.95 for the rational expectations model.
In the learning
model, the response of the Fed to inﬂation seems to be less aggressive. The parameter
αy displaying the Fed’s response to the economic activity is obtained similarly from the
learning and rational expectations models.
It is worth highlighting that the introduction of the adaptive learning leads
to an increase in likelihood from −1027.6 to −968.8, suggesting our model provides a
better performance than the rational expectations model in ﬁtting the data. Turning
to the variances of shocks, we could conjecture the source of this improvement. When
adaptive expectations are employed, the estimate of σπ is reported to be 0.50, which is
89

lower than 0.77 from rational expectations model. On the other hand, the parameter
σy is estimated to be higher in learning model. While adaptive learning plays a crucial
role in reducing errors from the Phillips curve, it does not seem to perform better than
rational expectations model in the IS curve. The variance of interest rate shock σi is
estimated to be lower with learning model employed. Overall, when considering a higher
likelihood, the improvement of the goodness-of-ﬁt from the Phillips curve and the Taylor
rule may dominate that from the IS curve.
Table 4.3 provides simple descriptions of the root mean square error of the
estimated adaptive expectations in the learning model and the one step ahead out-
of-sample VAR forecast respectively. The evaluation period for VAR forecast is from
1954Q1 to 1959Q4 and we forecast the inﬂation and the output gap of next period
recursively.
To compare the forecast performance of the adaptive expectations with
VAR forecast, we choose the same window size from 1960Q1 to 2007Q4. The results
in Table 4.3 present the better performance of the learning model with a much smaller
root mean square error.
The upper panel of Figure 4.2 reports the developments of adaptive inﬂation ex-
pectations and VAR forecast with the actual series. The estimated expectations provide
a good approximation of realized future inﬂation, closely following each turning point of
inﬂation without underestimating or overestimating the observed inﬂation. The lower
panel of Figure 4.2 depicts the dynamic behavior of output gap expectations and the
VAR forecast with the realized value of the output gap. As we observe here, the VAR
forecast is quite close to people’s estimated expectations.
However, as conﬁrmed in
Table 4.3, adaptive expectations seem to outperform the VAR forecast. Both adaptive
learning and VAR forecast capture each turning point of the output gap although there
is a lag from the realized series.
90

Figure 4.3 displays actual and predicted values for inﬂation and the output
gap. As we conﬁrm from the likelihoods, the model with adaptive expectations ﬁts the
data very well in general. In particular, the estimated Phillips curve performs quite well
in tracking inﬂation, even predicting each turning point. The predicted output gap also
provides a good approximation of the output gap. Overall, the predicted values appear
to suggest that adaptive learning works to match the data quite well.
This section arrives at four conclusions. First, the higher likelihood in the learn-
ing model demonstrates its better performance in the estimation compared to rational
expectations model. Second, adaptive expectations are conﬁrmed as a major source of
inﬂation persistence that is conﬁrmed by the relatively larger coeﬃcient on inﬂation
expectation in the learning model.
On the other hand, similar estimates on output
gap expectations in both learning and rational expectation model reveal the continuing
importance of the lagged output gap even though we introduce adaptive expectations
into the model. Third, although we assume that agents have naive knowledge about
the economy, people’s beliefs, measured by adaptive expectations outperform VAR fore-
casts in terms of the root mean square errors. Finally, the predicted inﬂation and the
output gap work very well in ﬁtting the actual data, which are presented in Figure 4.3.
Overall, estimation results and ﬁgures conﬁrm the importance of adaptive expectation,
especially in modeling inﬂation, which is an indispensable part of DSGE models. In the
next section, we simulate the model based on estimation results.

Impulse Response Functions
This section explores whether the learning model is able to generate plausible
responses to shocks. We employ the estimates from Table 4.2 to obtain impulse response
91

functions with two exceptions. We set σ to the value of 1, as in Clarida, Gali, and
Gertler (2000) because the estimate of σ is not statistically signiﬁcant. The estimate of
ρ is higher than that reported in the literature. We therefore set ρ to be 0.79, which
is consistent with the estimate of Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2000) for the Volcker-
Greenspan period.
Figure 4.4 displays impulse response functions to one-standard-deviation shocks.
Red lines present the eﬀects of each shock on the endogenous variables and blue lines
show responses of expectations to each shock. The learning model has the property that
expectations tend to move with a lag behind variables due to adaptive learning, as is
often observed in the surveys of inﬂation expectations.
The ﬁrst row presents the responses of inﬂation, the output gap, the interest
rate, and the dynamics of expectations in response to a cost-push shock. The shock leads
to an immediate increase in inﬂation. The eﬀect of the cost-push shock on inﬂation starts
to decrease over time. Following a cost-push shock, inﬂation expectations initially rise
before reaching a peak and then start to decrease. After several quarters, inﬂation and
inﬂation expectations seem to be on a similar path. The ﬁgure in the ﬁrst row and
second column shows the response of the output gap and its expectations to a cost-push
shock. After a slight increase, the output gap starts to decrease due to the increase in
the interest rate that results from the Fed’s response to stabilize inﬂation. Output gap
expectations move with a lag behind the output gap. In response to a cost-push shock,
the nominal interest rate initially increases due to rising inﬂation and then it starts to
fall in response to the decrease in inﬂation and the output gap.
Figures in the second row display responses of variables to a demand shock.
The shock has a positive, persistent eﬀect on inﬂation. Inﬂation expectations appear
to follow the inﬂation path with a lag. This feature could be observed in the surveys
92

of inﬂation expectations, such as the SPF and Livingston survey. A positive demand
shock causes the output gap to increase, and the eﬀect of the shock on output sharply
decreases over time. Since inﬂation and the output gap increase in response to a demand
shock, the interest rate increases.
The third row presents the impact of an interest rate shock on the variables
and expectations. Following an interest rate shock, both the actual inﬂation and its
expectations show hump-shaped responses. Despite the limited role of lagged inﬂation
in the Phillips curve, the model is able to generate a hump-shared response of inﬂation
to an interest rate shock. The interest rate has a negative eﬀect on inﬂation, leading to
a persistent decrease over time before reaching its bottom. The pattern of response of
inﬂation expectations is very similar to that of inﬂation. An interest rate shock leads to
a decrease in the output gap and its expectations.
Figure 4.5 reports the responses of key economic variables to one-standard-
deviation expectation shocks. An inﬂation expectation shock causes inﬂation to increase,
as does the cost-push shock. The patterns of responses of the variables are very similar to
those generated in response to a cost-push shock. Turning to an output gap expectation
shock, as reported in the second row, a positive output gap expectation shock raises the
inﬂation and output, therefore leading to an increase in the interest rate.
4.6
Conclusion
This paper examines the role of adaptive expectations in inﬂation and output
gap dynamics in the DSGE model. Interestingly, our estimates of inﬂation and output
gap expectations using naive adaptive learning appear to outperform VAR forecasts.
These results are meaningful, since DSGE models under rational expectations can be
93

expressed as VAR systems with parameter restrictions. Our ﬁndings also indicate that
the learning model outperforms the rational expectations DSGE model in terms of its
goodness of ﬁtness. Finally, the main contribution of this paper is to show that adaptive
expectations can replace the role of lagged inﬂation in generating inﬂation persistence.
When the model includes learning, the coeﬃcient on lagged inﬂation in the Phillips
curved is estimated to be around zero. However, the lagged output gap seems to play a
role in generating persistence, regardless of adaptive expectations.

Chapter 5
Conclusions
This dissertation contributes to the literature on the analysis of United States
Postwar business cycle ﬂuctuations in a perspective of Markov Switching and Bayesian
estimation. First, in Chapter 2, we propose a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) model with the assumption of regime switches in the private sector, in the
conduct of monetary policy and in the volatility of shocks.
A Gibbs-sampling with
Metropolish-Hasting algorithm is used to estimate this model. Our estimation results
support changes occurring in the private sector, in the monetary policy and in the
volatility of exogenous, non-policy shocks which are related to the “Great Inﬂation”,
the “Great Moderation” and the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.
Variance decomposition and
impulse response functions are conducted to reveal the role of diﬀerent shocks. Our
results ﬁnd irrespectively to monetary policy regimes, supply shocks are the main driver
of inﬂation ﬂuctuations, while demand shocks are the main source of changes in the
output gap.
If there were no switches in the agents’ beliefs, supply shocks are also
main drivers of the inﬂation. This chapter also demonstrates that if the agents always
maintain a weak response to economic dynamics, inﬂation would have been lower during
102

the 1970s. The more intense response to inﬂation by the Federal Reserve would also
have helped mitigate the great inﬂation. In addition, there were substantial changes in
agents’ beliefs, and in the volatility of shocks in the recent years. Such an occurrence
could be potential early signals of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.
Second, in Chapter 3, we propose a baseline dynamic model with ﬁve exten-
sions to investigate policymakers’ commitment to inﬂation and unemployment. Those
models are based on the conjecture that potential policymakers’ misperception may be
originated from unobserved deviations of unemployment from its natural rate.
Five
processes are purposed, which have been illustrated in the introduction part of this dis-
sertation. In addition to ﬁve processes, this chapter speciﬁes a loss function derived
from a constrained minimization of the divergence in inﬂation and unemployment that
also penalizes shifts in the policy variables. Bayesian estimation is also applied in this
chapter. Findings support our estimated belief performs the role of real interest rate.
Empirical results are summarized as follows: 1) policymakers’ belief is very persistent
even when it commits to a Taylor-type policy rule.
2) the run-up of U.S. inﬂation
around 1980 is mostly attributed to policymakers’ misperception while the peak in the
end of 1974 is possibly a result from large non-policy shocks. 3) models with commit-
ment dominate models without commitment, especially in periods of large oscillations
in inﬂation. When policymakers are committed to respond to a Taylor-type rule, the
average loss function is eﬃciently reduced over the time, thus eﬀectively lessening their
misperception. In addition to those ﬁndings, this chapter also contributes to important
policy implication as it indicates how and when it is appropriate for policymakers to
choose a commitment in their reaction to inﬂation and unemployment. That is, a ﬂex-
ible or more activist policy is more appropriate in reacting to inﬂation when there is
high unemployment target, whereas a policy that is consistent over time is more suitable
103

under low unemployment target. Moreover, our results shed light on the source of the
two large rises in inﬂation during the “Great Inﬂation” period and the prevalence of low
inﬂation during the early 1980s.
Third, in Chapter 4, we investigate the inﬂation persistence based a dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with adaptive expectation. We observe
in this chapter that model with adaptive expectation makes lagged inﬂation redundant
in ﬁtting inﬂation dynamics. Simultaneously, maximum likelihood estimation supports
a DSGE model with adaptive expectation is superior to a DSGE model with rational
expectation in model ﬁt and out-of-sample forecasting.
Overall, our analytical and empirical analysis based on three small dynamic
stochastic general equiilbrium (DSGE) models with Markov Switching contributes to in-
terpret the United States Postwar business cycle ﬂuctuations, especially for the evolution
of inﬂation, unemployment, output gap and interest rate. This dissertation identiﬁes
sources in driving inﬂation, unemployment and output gap as well as provides impor-
tant policy implications. Further analysis and investigation on medium and large DSGE
models in explaining U.S. macroeconomic dynamics as well as how to improve the model
ﬁt and forecasting performance based on Bayesian estimation will be interesting topics
for future research.

Assume Markov Switching transition matrices follow a Dirichlet distribution:
Hsp(·, i) ∼D(asp
ii , asp
ij )
Hsa(·, i) ∼D(asa
ii , asa
ij )
Her(·, i) ∼D(aer
ii , aer
ij )
Similar to Bianchi(2009), we choose asp
ii = asa
ii = aer
ii = 10 and asp
ij = asa
ij =
aer
ij = 1.
A.2
Hidden Markov Models
Given the hidden states Ξ = {ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξN}, the state at the length t as Qt
and the observation symbols V = {v1, v2, . . . , vM} and the symbol at the length t as Ot,
we can have the state transition probability distribution [A]ij = {aij} where
aij = P(Qt+1 = sj | Qt = si),
1 ≤i, j ≤N
Similarly, we can deﬁne the observation symbol probability distribution as
[B]jk = {bj(vk)}, where
bj(vk) = P(Ot = vk | Ot = sj),
1 ≤j ≤N, 1 ≤k ≤M

A.3
The model
We consider a prototypical New Keynesian monetary DSGE model in which
details can be found in King(2000) and Woodford(2003). Details of model description
could be referred to Bianchi(2009).
Consider a continuum of monopolistic ﬁrms, a representative household, and
a monetary policy authority in our economy. The household maximizes the following
utility function:
Et

subject to

Pt
+ Tt
Pt
= Wtht + Mt−1

(A.2)
For each monopolistically competitive ﬁrm, a quadratic adjustment cost is
derived from a downward-sloping demand curve:
Yt(j) =
Pt(j)
Pt
−1/υ
Yt
(A.3)
and we have quadratic adjustment cost as
ACt(j) = ϕ
2
 Pt(j)
Pt−1(j) −π
2
Yt(j)
(A.4)
Firms use a linear production function as:
Yt(j) = Atht(j)
(A.5)
111

where total factor productivity At evolves according to a random walk:
ln At = ln γ + ln At−1 + ˜at
(A.6)
˜at = ˜at−1 + ϵa,t
(A.7)
Firms maximize the present value of future proﬁts by choosing the price Pt(j):

(A.8)
where Qs is the marginal value of a unit of the consumption good: Qs/Qt = β[uc(s)/uc(t)] =
βs−t(Ct/Cs)τ.
The nominal interest rate is aﬀected by deviations of inﬂation and output from
their target levels:

(A.9)
In addition, government expenditure follows a stationary AR(1) process as
follows:
˜gt = ρg˜gt−1 + ϵg,t
(A.10)
Therefore ϵg,t can be interpreted as a shock to Government expenditure. The government
collects a lump-sum tax(or provides a subsidy) to balance the ﬁscal deﬁcit:
