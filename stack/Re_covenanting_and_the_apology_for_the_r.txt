Abstract 
This thesis analyses Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Apology for the Indian Residential 
School System and its media coverage as a process of re-covenanting.  The author 
demonstrates that, by splitting the totem of the identity of Canada into a sinning chapter 
and an essential national character, members of the totem domain were able to sacrifice 
the totem of Canada, which had been polluted through violations of the beliefs in equality 
and human rights in the residential school system though the symbolic sacrifice of the 
leader and representative of the people, the Prime Minister.  After sacrificing the totem of 
the sinning nation through the humiliation of the confession of sin and apology, the totem 
was regenerated to its unpolluted, ideal state.  This apology process constitutes a 
narrative of re-covenanting in line with Abrahamic and more universal religious 
structures, reaffirming our commitment to the values of the apology.

Introduction: A New Covenant 
Along with nineteen other recommendations in their 2012 interim report, The 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada advised that “the Government of 
Canada distribute a framed copy of the “Statement of Apology to Former Students of 
Indian Residential Schools” for prominent public display and ongoing educational 
purposes” in every secondary school in Canada (Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
of Canada, p.29, 2012).  It may seem ironic that, in a country which no longer insists on 
flying the flag or displaying the picture of the queen or prime minister, and where prayer 
is not allowed in public schools, an apology from the representative of the Canadian 
people to indigenous residential school survivors may become a fixture of every 
secondary school in the nation.  However, as this essay argues, contemporary Canada 
is based on the civil religion of liberal democracy, which consists particularly of a 
devotion to human rights and equality.  Stephen Harper’s (2008) apology may be on its 
way to becoming a defining covenant of the secular religion of Canada.   
This fact has interesting implications in our post-industrial, secular nation, as, 
despite their modernist, a-theistic trappings, contemporary collective apologies are 
overshadowed by Abrahamic1, notions of repentance and forgiveness, as well as more 
universal religious themes of sacrifice and regeneration.  Scholars have pointed out that, 
in formerly explicitly Christian nations, the process of secularization is often not strictly 
de-Christianization, but rather “investing the allegorical categories of the biblical story of 
salvation with temporal, historical significance” (Babik, 2006, p. 376).  Taking my cue 
from Australian sociologist Danielle Celermajer (2009), I see the collective apology as a 
 
1  
“Abrahamic” is Derrida’s (2007) term for the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition.  He writes: 
“This tradition -- complex and differentiated, even conflictual -- is at once singular and on the 
way to universalization through that which a certain theatre of forgiveness puts in place or 
brings to light” (p. 28; cited in Henderson and Wakeham, 2009, p. 16). 

 
2 
prime example of this: the narrative set out by the apology and its media coverage 
applied the biblical concept of re-covenanting.2   
While the religious tone of the narrative of public apologies is occasionally overtly 
stated, as in the hopes that the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission 
would function as a “secular equivalent to the ancient Christian Rite of Reconciliation” 
(Daye, 2004, p.2) with Archbishop Desmond Tutu as “confessor of the nation,” (p.160)3 
in the Canadian context, collective apologies, such as Stephen Harper’s 2008 apology to 
the former students of Indian residential schools, are couched in more secular terms 
such as ‘healing’ and ‘forgiveness’. While some scholars (e.g. Griswold, 2007, p. xv) 
argue that contemporary examinations of political apologies need not be bound within a 
religious framework, I argue that contemporary collective apologies, no matter how 
secular they might appear, are guided by deeply entrenched myths and religious 
narratives and, in order for their meaning and power to be fully understood, must be 
examined with these in mind.  Particularly, collective apologies must be examined in the 
light of the concept of re-covenanting, as such apologies serve to re-define and renew a 
group’s commitment to its core beliefs.  
1.1. The Concept of the Covenant 
As I argue that the apology is part of a process of re-covenanting following the 
Burkean Order, it is necessary that I first describe what a covenant is and why I see the 
apology as fitting into the structure of a covenant.  This will help to illuminate the 
similarities and differences between covenant theory and secular political practices 
leading to a greater understanding of the historical and religious underpinnings of 
secular narratives, such as the apology.  
 
2  
I take this term, and much of the theory behind it, from the work of Danielle Celermajer 
(2009).

South African human rights activist and professor Andre Du Troit was among the voices that 
worried that, “[a]s religious leaders and churches became increasingly involved in the 
commission’s work, the influence of religious style and symbolism supplanted political and 
human rights concerns” (quoted in Minow, 1998, p. 55).  He particularly worried that those 
who do not agree with this framework would not want to take part in truth commissions 
(Minow, p. 80).

Whereas a promise refers to a vow to do or not do a specific action, a covenant 
is an agreement to exist in concert with a set of principles binding for all time.  In Old 
Testament theology, covenants also differ from contracts in that contracts are secular, 
“private legal and economic agreements, such as conveyances, deeds and work 
contracts” (Tucker, 1965, p. 488), while covenants are “the means the ancient world took 
to extend relationships beyond the natural unity by blood” (McCarthy, cited in Niehaus, 
2009, p.226).  Moreover, unlike a promise or a contract, a covenant relies on an already 
existing relationship.  As Neihaus notes, “a covenant assumes some past history of 
relationship (however minimal) between two parties…  [and] changes the relationship 
between the two covenanting parties and takes it to a different level.”  A covenant 
between two nations may, for example, bind them to mutual assistance in the case of 
third party aggression, while a covenant of marriage allows a couple’s relationship to 
become more intimate.  I see the apology for the residential schools as doing just this: 
taking an existing relationship to a new level.  With the apology, the nation of Canada 
redefined its relationship with its aboriginal people, and rededicated itself to acting in 
harmony with the principles of human rights and equality as embodied in the Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms (Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 1982).  It is a means to create 
unity amongst not just the government and the indigenous population, nor even just the 
government and the citizens of Canada as a whole but also between settler/immigrant 
Canadians and the indigenous population. 
The notion of the covenant is essential to Judeo-Christian thought.  The Torah is 
based on the belief that God made a special covenant with the Israelites which requires 
them to live by certain commandments (Hodge, 1877) while in Christian studies, the idea 
of covenant can be seen as an interpretive framework for the entire Bible (Frame, 1999).  
In fact, the term New Testament comes from the Latin translation of the Greek term New 
Covenant.  With the concept of the covenant being so central to Judeo-Christian 
thought, it is not surprising that we see its reflection in the present, Canadian, secular, 
political world. 
In the popular Christian context, a covenant is defined as “a solemn agreement 
between members of a church to act together in harmony with the precepts of the 
gospel” (“covenant”, n.d.a.).  With this, we are beginning to see how Stephen Harper’s 
apology for the Indian Residential School System holds many of the same properties of 

 
4 
not just Old Testament covenants, but also the contemporary Christian term.  The 
apology is an agreement between the people of Canada and its leaders, as embodied by 
the head of the state, to “act together in harmony with the precept of the gospel,” that 
gospel being The Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The apology is a rededication to act 
in harmony with these principles.  
Paul William states that a covenant “involves the making of solemn promises by 
means of a verbal and/or enacted oath” (cited in Niehaus, 2009, p.236) while Tucker 
(1965) notes that “[w]hen Yahweh swears a covenant with any of his people, the 
emphasis is upon his promise to them” (p. 494).  Harper solemnly promised, that 
violations of fundamental values of the nation would “never again” (Harper, 2008) occur 
between Canada and it is indigenous people.  The emphasis of the apology, as we will 
see shortly as I examine the structure of the covenant, was on the government’s promise 
to the native population.  As Harper apologizes for “failing to protect” native peoples, we 
see that, just like the biblical covenants, it is a promise that is like both that of a lord to a 
vassal and that of a husband to a wife, the emphasis is on the lord/husband’s obligations 
to protect his servant/wife.   
From its very beginnings in Mesopotamia and Ancient Israel the notion of 
covenant has always been connected to the nation.  In his examination of “The 
Covenant of Grace,” 19th century Puritan theologian, Charles Hodge (1877) notes that 
the Mosaic covenant is: 1) a re-enactment of the covenant made with Adam; 2) a 
national covenant, giving land and “national security”  based on obedience, and 3) part 
of a sacrificial system.  This categorization pertains to the apology in several ways.  First 
of all, just as the Mosaic covenant is a re-enactment of the Adamic covenant, the 
apology can be seen as a re-enactment and reinterpretation of previous national 
covenants, most notably, The Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  This is what Celermajer 
(2009) has coined re-covenanting: through the apology we update and recommit 
ourselves to our national values.  Secondly, the apology is most definitely a national 
covenant.  It is made by the head of the nation -- the Prime Minister, in the national 
temple -- the House of Commons.  Important to my argument that the apology is a 
process of covenanting following the Burkean Order is the fact that covenants are 
intimately connected to notions of sacrifice.

1.1.1. 
Covenant and Sacrifice: 
The root word of the Hebrew term for covenant, berith is simply to cut 
(“Covenant,” n.d.a.); thus we see that from the beginnings of Judeo-Christian thought 
covenants have been sealed with sacrifice.  The term sacrifice is derived from the Latin 
sacrificium, which is a combination of the terms sacer (“set apart from the secular or 
profane for the use of supernatural powers” (“Sacrifice”, n.d.) and facere (to make).  
Thus, a sacrifice makes something sacred.  As Israeli psychologist Ofer Zur (n.d.) notes, 
sacrifices are part of a process of establishing a relationship with the divine.  I argue that 
the apology, as covenant, is part of a similar sacrificial process.  While many have noted 
the importance of the sacrifice of soldiers in the maintenance of the nation with phrases 
like “the individual must die so that the nation might live" (Konigsberg; cited in Zur, n.d.), 
few have noted that this process is also at work symbolically through rituals such as 
public apologies by national leaders.4  Through the apology, Stephen Harper willfully 
offers himself which seals the covenant through symbolic sacrifice by humiliation. 
1.1.2. 
Covenantal Framework 
Theorists have noted how historical covenants of differing purposes have a 
similar framework.  Perhaps the most detailed and influential of these investigations   is 
the work of George Mendenhall (cited in Sutton, 1987) and Meredith G. Kline (1963, 
1975).  As David Cayley (2012) explains in “The Myth of the Secular”, “Western societies 
continually deploy a repertoire of themes and images” from religious sources.  An 
examination of the similarities and differences between frameworks such as Kline’s 
(1963, 1975) covenantal structure, and a secular narratives, such as public apologies, 
leads us to a greater understanding of the power and meaning of these narratives.   
In his influential work Treaty of the Great King: the Covenant Structure of 
Deuteronomy (1963), and The Structure of Biblical Authority (1975) Kline identifies 
commonalities between ancient Near Eastern suzerain (particular second millennium 
 
4  
It is also necessary here to note the difference between the two very similar concepts of 
scapegoat and a sacrifice.  Whereas a sacrifice is used to seal a covenant, a scapegoat 
helps to reorder the community through taking on its sins.  This difference will be discussed 
further in Chapter Three.

BCE Hittite) covenants and the covenants of the Old Testament.  Kline demonstrated 
that ancient Near Eastern suzerain covenants have the structure outlined in Table 1. 
Table 1:

2. Historical Prologue:

2.  enumerates the specific obligations to maintaining the

a list of the gods witnessing the covenant 
5.  Sanctions:

Note:  
Adapted from The Treaty of the Great King, (1963) and The Structure of Biblical Authority, (1975) 
both by M.G. Kline. 
Kline finds examples of this structure in Exodus and Deuteronomy though he 
notes that these texts do not include a list of witnessing gods as Yahweh stresses his 
sole authority.  Table 2 lists some of Kline’s examples of how this structure is expressed 
in the Old Testament.   
Table 2: The Structure of Biblical Covenants 
1.  Preamble: 
ex. “I am Yahweh, your God” (Exodus 20:2) 
2.  Historical Prologue: 
ex. “who brought you out of Egypt, out of slavery” (Exodus 20:2) 
3. Ethical Stipulations: 
ex. 1.  the first of the ten commandments stresses exclusive loyalty and love 
(“You shall have no other Gods before me”  (Exodus 20:3)  
2.  the other nine commandments are specific requirements  
4.  Sanctions: 
ex. list of curses and blessings in Deuteronomy 27:1-28:68 
5.  Administration and 
Succession 
Arrangements: 
ex. copies of the document are to be placed at religious sanctuaries (Deut. 
31:26) with periodic public reading of the document (Deuteronomy 31:9-
13) 
Note:  Adapted from The Treaty of the Great King, (1963) and The Structure of Biblical 
Authority, (1972/1975) both by M.G. Kline. 
Numerous Christian thinkers have mapped similar covenant formula onto the 
New Testament (e.g. Chilton; cited in Sutton, 1987; Frame, 1999; Hunt, 1988; Sutton, 

 
7 
1987).  Though these scholars disagree about how well New Testament thinking fits into 
Kline’s formula, such theologians see this mapping as a manner of better understanding 
New Testament thought.  Others (ex, Lomasky, 2011) have argued that examining 
political documents such as The U.S. Constitution in terms of the structure of biblical 
covenants can lead to better understanding of the meaning of these documents.  
Following this line of thought, examining Stephen Harper’s Apology for the residential 
schools in light of covenantal frameworks, such as that put forth by Kline (1963, 
1972/1975), is a useful analytical tool for illuminating the deeply entrenched religious 
nativities at work in contemporary secular narratives.   
In parliament, the apology began with this preamble from Stephen Harper: 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin officially, let me just take a moment to 
acknowledge the role of certain colleagues here in the House of 
Commons in today's events.  Although the responsibility for the apology is 
ultimately mine alone, there are several of my colleagues who do deserve 
the credit…  
(Harper, 2008, “Statements by Ministers,” para.1)  
The Prime Minister then goes on to thank the Mister of Indian Affairs and various 
other MPs with particular thanks to Jack Layton, the then-leader of the New Democratic 
Party. 
In line with Kline’s (1963) covenant formula, before beginning the apology, 
Stephen Harper essentially names the King (himself) and stresses his greatness by 
stating that the responsibility is “ultimately [his] alone” (2008, “Statements by Minister,” 
para 1.). 
The apology then moves onto a lengthier Historical Prologue completely in 
keeping with Kline’s (1963, 1972/1975) covenant formula: 
For more than a century, Indian Residential Schools separated over 
150,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities.   
In the 1870's, the federal government, partly in order to meet its obligation 
to educate Aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development 
and administration of these schools.  
 

 
8 
 
 
 
(Harper, 2008, “Statements by Ministers,” para. 5-6).  
Instead of a list of stipulations, such as the Ten Commandments in 
Deuteronomy, Harper (2008) goes on to provide a list of sins which are condemned as 
wrongs that should not be repeated; these, in effect, act as ‘thou-shalt-nots’ for the 
government and the Canadian nation as a whole.  
Two primary objectives of the Residential Schools system were to remove 
and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions 
and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture.   
These objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and 
spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal.   
Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, "to kill the Indian in the 
child".   
Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has 
caused great harm, and has no place in our country … 
The Government of Canada built an educational system in which very 
young children were often forcibly removed from their homes, often taken 
far from their communities.   
Many were inadequately fed, clothed and housed.  All were deprived of 
the care and nurturing of their parents, grandparents and communities. 
First Nations, Inuit and Métis languages and cultural practices were 
prohibited in these schools.   
Tragically, some of these children died while attending residential schools 
and others never returned home.  
 
 
(Harper, 2008, “Statements by Ministers,” para. 8-16) 
The apology then immediately shifts to the section lacking in Deuteronomy, 
though present in the Suzerainty formula: a list of witnesses (Kline, 1963).   
To the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family 
members and communities, the Government of Canada now recognizes 
that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes and we 
apologize for having done this.  

 
9 
 
 
(Harper, 2008, “Statements by Ministers” para. 22) 
The next section in Kline’s formula is a list curses and blessing, as in 
Deuteronomy 28.  Though the apology does not list what will happen if we do not live in 
harmony with The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it does list the curses that have 
fallen upon us because we did not live under these conditions in the past.  
We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we 
undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children 
and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, and we apologize for 
having done this.   
We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse 
or neglect and were inadequately controlled, and we apologize for failing 
to protect you.   
Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became 
parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering 
the same experience, and for this we are sorry.  
 
 
 
(Harper, 2008, “Statements by Ministers”, para. 24-26) 
The final portion of the apology combines the final two sections of Kline’s (1963) 
formula by both listing the blessings which will occur if the covenant is maintained, and 
discussing the administration of the covenant via the Indian Residential Schools Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission. 
In moving toward healing, reconciliation and resolution of the sad legacy 
of Indian residential schools, the implementation of the Indian residential 
schools settlement agreement began on September 19, 2007.  Years of 
work by survivors, communities and aboriginal organizations culminated 
in an agreement that gives us a new beginning and an opportunity to 
move forward together in partnership. 
A cornerstone of the settlement agreement is the Indian residential 
schools truth and reconciliation commission.  This commission represents 
a unique opportunity to educate all Canadians on the Indian residential 
schools system.  It will be a positive step in forging a new relationship 
between aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, a relationship based on 
the knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a 
desire to move forward with a renewed understanding that strong 
families, strong, communities and vibrant cultures and traditions will 
contribute 
to 
a 
stronger 
Canada 
for 
all 
of 
us.   
 
 
(Harper, 2008, “Statements by Ministers,” para. 31-32). 

 
10 
It is particularly notable that Kline (1963, 1972/1975) lists that the final act in the 
covenant formula of the Old Testament as a declaration to place copies of the covenant 
in the holy sanctuaries of the Israelites.  As noted at the beginning of this chapter, the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission has recently recommended that copies of Stephen 
Harper’s Statement of Apology (2008) be placed in every secondary school across the 
country.  
One particular difference between the Old Testament/Ancient Near Eastern 
covenants and the apology is in the ambiguity as to who the Lord/Husband is and who is 
the vassal/wife in the agreement.  This ambiguity is a result of the fact that Stephen 
Harper retains the position of Lord, but as democratic leader, he is a representation of 
his constituents and the entire nation state.  As such, the apology acts as a covenant on 
three different levels: 1. a covenant between the Lord (The Prime Minister) and a 
particular group of his vassals (Indigenous People) whom he has a duty to protect; 2. a 
treaty between the non-indigenous population of Canada and its indigenous population 
(i.e. an agreement between two separate nations existing in the same space); 3. a 
commitment by the government to the entire imagined community of the nation of 
Canada to rededicate itself to the previously agreed upon values of equality and human 
rights which the government had violated in the Indian Residential School system.  As 
we can see, examining the apology within Kline’s framework of ancient Near Eastern 
and Judaic covenants illuminates the similarities and differences between secular 
proclamations such as Harper’s apology and the foundational religious narratives of our 
Judeo-Christian society.  
1.1.3. 
Re-Covenanting and the Burkean Order 
 
Now that I have noted how the apology can be better understood in light of the 
concept of the covenant, we can proceed with a brief introduction to the heart of my 
thesis: the apology as an example of re-covenanting through the Burkean Order.  In the 
social drama of the public apology a norm was transgressed, the transgression was 
apologized for, and society returns to its state before the transgression, thus, 
maintaining social homeostasis.  In this examination of the framing of Stephen Harper’s 
2008 apology for the Indian residential school system and its media coverage, I draw on 
a similar, yet more detailed framework: Kenneth Burke’s (1970) anthropological-

 
11 
rhetorical narrative of Order, Rejection, Pollution, Sacrifice, and finally Redemption and 
Restoration of the Order.  I argue that this cycle constitutes a cycle of re-covenanting.  
Following Burkean logic, once the covenant (or order) has been broken (or rejected), a 
sacrifice must be made in order for the covenant to be restored (and order to be 
reaffirmed).  It is the act of re-covenanting: introducing and committing to a new 
covenant, that both social integration and social progress are achieved.  In publicly 
apologizing, the government states its deepest values and goals, thus conveying a new 
covenant to its citizens and recreating and strengthening our national narrative via the 
media. 
Stephen Harper’s apology for the residential schools and its media coverage 
reveal this narrative at work: the covenant of peace and upholding human rights was 
broken, so the symbolic sacrifice of the representative of that order, the prime minister, 
occurred through ritual death by the humiliation of the apology.  In doing this, the nation 
could then be reborn, cleansed, with a new identity.  Through the process of apology we 
are able to “re-covenant” (Celermajer, 2009), in line with Abrahamic belief structures, as 
well as, rituals of totemic regeneration through scapegoating which tap into universal 
belief structures.  Through an analysis of the apology itself and its media coverage, I 
show how, by splitting the totem of the identity of Canada into a sinning chapter and an 
essential national character, members of the totem domain were able to sacrifice the 
totem of Canada, which had been polluted through violations of the beliefs in equality 
and human rights in the residential school system via the symbolic killing through 
humiliation of the leader of the nation.  After sacrificing the totem of the sinning nation 
through the humiliation of the confession of sin and apology, members of the totem 
domain regenerated the unpolluted totem to its ideal state.  Just as Hodge (1877) 
declared that the biblical covenants were, “nothing but a declaration of the eternal and 
immutable principles of justice,” this apology serves as a declaration of Canada’s 
commitment to the values of human rights and equality.  
My analysis reveals universal frames including status reversal, humiliation, 
separation of the sinning nation from the cleansed nation, catharsis, and rebirth in the 
apology itself and its media coverage, which serve to construct a narrative of re-
covenanting through the apology of the totem leader.  The framing of both the apology 
and its media coverage ignored the colonial roots of the residential school system by 

 
12 
separating Canada into two distinct parts: a past era which was responsible for the 
residential school system and a present era that embraces the liberal democratic values 
as embodied in the charter of rights and freedoms.  However, like Arendt’s (1958) world-
delimiting moments, the apology presents an essence of the nation state, free of 
previous sins.  This glimpse is both a return to an idealized past and a glimpse of a 
utopian future while espousing the covenant of dedication to human rights and equality.  
In Burkean terms, the apology allows us to return to the unified state that existed before 
the moral order was polluted by the offence.  Through the apology we are able to enact 
the mystical paradox of returning to the past in order to move forward and be born again, 
cleansed of sin.  In this manner it has the ability to influence the future as we, as a 
nation, rededicate ourselves to our society as a whole and to a new covenant. 
1.2. Chapter Outline 
I began this analysis by noting that Stephen Harper’s 2008 apology for the 
residential schools may soon be a fixture of every secondary school in the nation, thus 
securing a place in our national narrative.  I then explain what a covenant is, how the 
apology fits into covenant format, and then briefly explained how, through an analysis of 
the apology and its media coverage, I see the apology as a form of re-covenanting which 
followed the Burke’s cycle of Order, Transgression causing Pollution, and Sacrifice 
which leads to the restoration of the Order.  The following chapters provide an overview 
of some of the literature on public apologies and expand on the theoretical framework as 
well as my own analysis of the apology and its media framing. 
In the second chapter I prepare the ground for this analysis by defining key 
concepts and note the history of the public apology.  I review literature concerning 
collective apologies from a variety of perspectives, drawing on the work of psychologist 
Aaron Lazare (2004), sociologist Nicholas Tavuchis (1991), legal scholar Martha Minow 
(1998) and philosophers Hannah Arendt (1958) and Charles L. Griswold (2007).  I then 
offer some context by discussing the recent proliferation of public apologies and cite 
reasons why this may have occurred.  Closing the definitions of the apology with a 
profession of my belief in the importance of apology and forgiveness, I move on to a 
brief introduction to the idea of civil religion and secular ritual, a framework which 

 
13 
underlies this analysis, including the role of the media in the ritual of the public apology.  
This leads to a review of the literature on media events, another crucial ingredient in the 
foundation of this analysis.  I finish the second chapter with a discussion of media 
framing, as this essay is based on my analysis on the frames I see in the apology and its 
media coverage. 
The third chapter is an attempt to convey my interdisciplinary theory regarding 
the narrative of re-covenanting and Burke’s cycle of Order, Transgression, Sacrifice and 
Restoration that I see in the framing of the apology itself and its media coverage.  I dive 
directly into a discussion of the origins of Burke’s cycle as a response to universal 
feelings of ubiquitous guilt, which leads into an overview of the scapegoat mechanism.  
From here, I discuss the concept of the totem, particularly in regards to the scapegoat 
mechanisms.  I pay particular attention to the process of identification in opposition to 
the scapegoat, merging the work of Durkheim (1912/1995) regarding the totem as 
symbol of the community itself with Burke’s theories of sacrifice and rebirth.  My 
discussion of the totem and sacrifice in the secular nation draws on the work of 
communications theorist Carolyn Marvin and clinical psychologist David W. Ingle (1996, 
1999) who combine the work of Durkheim with that of Rene Girard (1977, 1987, 2001) --
who was, himself, heavily influenced by Burke -- to position the Durkheimian concept of 
the totem and totem regeneration as rituals of community identity and unity building in 
the media saturated age.  I then, hopefully, make these theories less esoteric by 
applying them to contemporary Canada with a discussion of the residential school 
system as synecdoche for Canada’s original sin of colonialism. 
The fourth chapter, my analysis, is the heart of my thesis.  In this chapter I 
analyze the apology and its media coverage as a narrative of re-covenanting.  I begin 
this chapter by discussing the importance of the media in the public sphere as moderator 
between the “sphere of public authority” (Habermas, 1962/1989) and the citizens.  I then 
lay out my findings of the key frames that I discovered in the analysis following Burke’s 
cycle of pollution, sacrifice, and rebirth and the latent cultural narrative of totem 
regeneration via scapegoating that they reveal.  I begin by examining the lead up to the 
apology including Phil Fontaine’s revelation of the extent of the abuse in the residential 
schools and the inadequate sacrifice of then-Minister Jane Stewart.  I then discuss one 
of the most important frames I found in this analysis -- humiliation -- in terms of rituals of 

 
14 
status reversal and the divine scapegoat, noting the media framing of Jack Layton as the 
key denouncer and Phil Fontaine as carnival king.  After this, I move on to the media 
framing of the apology in terms of a catharsis and symbolic resolution and possibly the 
most striking of all the frames in both the apology itself and its media coverage: the 
splitting of Canada into two distinct eras, a sinning period and an essential, cleansed 
era.  Next, I address the frame of rebirth after the apology, paying particular attention to 
Danielle Celermajer’s assertion that political apologies serve as rituals of re-covenanting.  
I go on to discuss the apology as a national unity building exercise, a frame which the 
media was particularly fond of drawing upon.  I contextualize my findings by addressing 
frames that were not there, mainly, the granting of forgiveness.  I conclude by discussing 
reasons for both optimism and pessimism as to the apology process itself without 
delving into the impact, if any, the apology has for the future.  Finally I make 
recommendations for further research on the apology process and its impact. 
1.3. Significance of the Study:            
The significance of this research lies in the real world consequences of media 
framing.  Burke shows us how words are the means of domination which shape 
attitudes, and as attitudes are “incipient facts”, words do eventually influence actions 
(cited in Carter, 1996, p. 63).5  Though the impact of this framing on the relationship 
between aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples in Canada and on the condition of 
aboriginal peoples within Canada is beyond the scale of this brief examination, 
recognizing this framing is useful to understanding our own national narratives and the 
 
5  
On a micro, measurable level, studies have found that the wording of questions can have 
significant impact on respondents’ perceptions of issues.  Experiments conducted by Nelson 
and Kinder (1996; cited in Nelson, Oxley and Clawson, 1997) show how the framing of 
welfare, affirmative action, and AIDS, influenced people’s opinions of policy regarding these 
issues.  On a larger scale, Nelson, Oxley, and Clawson discuss how the news media framed 
the war in the former Yugoslavia as either “a genocidal war of imperialism between a 
bloodthirsty invader and its helpless neighbor... [or a] religious dispute which has only 
recently flared up after communist domination of the region vanished” (1997, p.222).  They 
argue that these frames presented differing views of what the international community’s role 
ought to be in regards to the conflict stating that the “genocide frame recommends immediate 
and decisive international intervention in the conflict, while the lingering dispute frame 
counsels restraint, as nothing can be done about the situation anyway” (p.222).  Thus, the 
framing of an issue can have an impact on how we respond to it. 

 
15 
social processes underlying national identity and unity formation and political 
forgiveness.  I leave the question of how these frames affect attitudes, beliefs, and finally 
social conditions, to the next researcher.  
  Despite the fact that I do not examine the results of this framing, I believe that 
recognizing the frames involved in these narratives is important as one of the key frames 
revealed in this essay -- scapegoating -- is a particularly dangerous narrative.  Burke 
cautions against the poetic power of the scapegoating process in almost every one of his 
major works (Carter, 1996, p. 108), warning us that, left unchecked, our narratives can 
get out of hand, leading to the scapegoating of innocent victims (Carter, p. 52); as 
Burkean scholar C. Allan Carter states, in “the pyre of an inquisition, the gallows of 
frontier justice, or the gas chambers of genocide... the persistence through history of 
atrocities perpetrated by persons determined to satisfy their need for sacrificial victims is 
an indication of the force behind those events” (p. xvii). Moreover, Carter warns us that 
although our thirst for victims might not be growing, the possibility of doing more damage 
increases with new technologies (p. xviii).  Cognizant of these dangers, Burke argues 
that we must critique our own stories using the same mechanism that got us into trouble 
in the first place: language --though we cannot break free of words, at least we can 
choose our words more carefully (Carter, p. 52).  As Carter succinctly notes,  
analyzing our stories would help us understand our narrative identities 
and recognize the principles in the grip of which we operate when we lash 
out at others as the cause of our frustration and they in turn lash back at 
us.  Burke puts his faith in our ability to expose the darker side of myth to 
the light of critical analysis.  For our own sake and sake of others, we 
must translate the dramatic intensity of narrative back into the cooler 
gloss of logic in order that our contradictions may be made apparent and 
our rush toward victimization checked… through systematic criticism of 
narrative we can limit ourselves to relatively benign forms of victimage.  
Through repeated efforts at self-criticism we can restrict ourselves to 
nonviolent types of sacrifice, such as the sacrifice of once tightly held 
ideas in the give-and-take of debate.   
(Carter, p. 53) 
It is with these words of warning in mind that I undertake the examination of 
Stephen Harper’s 2008 apology for the Indian Residential School system and its media 
coverage.

2. 
Literature Review:  Apology and Ritual 
To paraphrase Burke (1966), a definition is the writer’s equivalent of a lyric (p.3).  
In accordance with this metaphor, I begin this opera with an aria.  Before delving into the 
theoretical background of this analysis, I use this chapter to define the terms necessary 
for understanding what the public apology is, as well as offering some historical context 
particularly as to the Greek, Abrahamic, and modern psychological, philosophical and 
sociological understandings of forgiveness and apologies.  I then move on to discuss the 
proliferation of the public apology in recent times and some of the complexities of the 
collective apology then argue for the importance of apology and forgiveness in our 
imperfect world.  From this, I move on to an introduction to the concepts of civil religion 
and the theory of media events, both of which underlie this study. 
2.1. The Public Apology Defined and Explained 
The meaning of the modern term apology is quite different from the Greek term 
apologia from which it is derived; indeed, one could say that it is the opposite.  The 
meaning of apologia is simply a defense, in no way a plea for forgiveness with an implicit 
admission of guilt as the modern term has come to mean.  We see this in the ancient 
legal terms kategoria, which was the speech of the prosecution, and apologia, which 
was the rebuttal of the defense.  The ancient Greeks, in fact, did not see forgiveness and 
apology at all in the same light as we do now.  Historian of philosophy Charles L. 
Griswold (2007, p. 7) notes that, for the Greeks, forgiveness was far from a virtue.  The 
Socratic megalopsychos -- man of great virtue -- had no need to apologize, as he was 
morally perfect, and had no need to accept apologies as he did not pay heed to non-
virtuous people (i.e. those who might need to apologize).  For Aristotle, the idea of god 
offering forgiveness was particularly preposterous as god has no time for the affairs of 
men:  the Aristotelian God is the paradigm of perfection and therefore spends all his time 
thinking about himself qua himself (pp. 9-10). 

 
17 
We can see that in a perfectionist ethical system like that of the ancient Greeks, 
apology is unnecessary: apology and forgiveness only become meaningful with the 
understanding of humans as fundamentally flawed, burdened by ubiquitous guilt.  As 
such, forgiveness is a key feature of the Abrahamic tradition.  Griswold (2007) writes 
that, “forgiveness is a virtue against the background of a narrative about human nature 
and its aspirations” referring to “metaphysical forgiveness” as, “the effort to give up the 
ressentiment caused by the manifold imperfections of the world” (p. xix)  While Griswold 
does much to avoid religious language, the necessity of forgiveness in light of the 
doctrine of original sin has long been noted; 18th Century theologian and philosopher 
Bishop Joseph Butler begins both of his sermons on forgiveness by noting the 
imperfection of the world and the problems with reconciliation with this imperfection 
(Griswold, p. xxii).  As both Butler and modern thinkers such as Harvard law professor 
Martha Minow point out, forgiveness enables us to express compassion in our 
recognition of our shared imperfection and our commonality as sinners (Griswold, p. 34; 
Minow, 1998, p. 20), a great virtue in the Abrahamic tradition. 
2.1.1. 
The Modern Term 
In its most basic form, the modern term apology can be defined as simply the act 
of saying sorry.  As Canadian sociologist Nicholas Tavuchis (1991) states, “other 
features, for example, offers of reparation, self-castigation, shame, embarrassment, or 
promises to reform, may accompany an apology, but they are inessential because… 
they are implicit in the state of being sorry” (p. 36)  Though it might seem 
counterintuitive, public and private apologies not only serve the same functions 
(“acknowledging the offense, offering explanations, expressing shame and remorse, and 
making reparations” (Lazare, 2004, p. 39) but also share the same dyadic nature.  As 
Tavuchis (p. 98) explains, for the collective apology to be successful, all parties 
concerned, but particularly the injured party, must perceive of the Many as a single entity 
with its own voice.  Griswold (2007, p. 190) argues that the group must be 

 
18 
anthropomorphized and given the agency to express itself.6  In this manner, the 
collective apology retains its dyadic nature. 
However, Tavuchis (1991) states that collective apologies go beyond the dyadic 
nature that they share with private apologies as they are addressed not only to the 
offended party, but also to “interested third parties, the wider society, its own institutional 
history, and posterity.”  He argues that we can therefore not judge collective apologies 
on features present in personal apologies, such as emotion, but that, “the practical and 
symbolic import of collective apology has to be judged in terms of the remedial and 
reparative work it accomplishes” (p. 109).  This, as I see it, is the key difference between 
the private and public apology: the importance of sincerity vs. posterity.  Both Tavuchis 
(p. 71-2) and Professor of Psychiatry Aaron Lazare (2004, p. 39) argue that private 
apologies must be felt to be sincere whereas the importance of the public apology is not 
its sincerity but rather, its ability to put the things on the public record.  As Griswold 
(2007) concisely states, the purpose of “an official, ritual, or ceremonial expression of 
apology and regret, offered in a political context, is precisely to communicate a moral 
point publicly and impersonally” (p. 142).  Even an insincere public apology still serves to 
publicly endorse rules of conduct (Lazare, p. 119) or provide grounds for compensation 
(Tavuchis, p. 63).  We can see this clearly as so many political apologies, including 
Harper’s apology for the residential schools, are tied to education campaigns.  As 
political and social theorist Steven Lukes (1997, p. 366; quoted in Harris, Grainger & 
Mullany, 2006, p. 719) argues, a demand for a public apology is often a demand for “a 
reconsideration and discursive reframing of history” as opposed to a request for a 
sincere expression of regret.  The apology process contributes a narrative of 
rededication to the norms of the society.       
Although all apologies pertain to issues of social order and membership in a 
moral community (Lazare, 2004; Tavuchis, 1991; Griswold, 2007), Tavuchis notes that 
these features are particularly emphasized by the public apology (p.39).  In a 
 
6  
For example, when individual Japanese citizens apologized at the Israeli embassy following 
the Lod Airport Massacre in which members of the Japanese Red Army had murdered Israeli 
citizens, Griswold argues that the Japanese saw themselves as, “symbolic co-offenders,” 
despite the fact that they, personally, had no involvement in the massacre (Griswold, 2007, p. 
49). 

 
19 
Foucouldian sense, our understandings of concepts such as social and moral rules 
become heightened in the presence of deviance (Tavuchis, p. 12); thus, genuine 
apologies are affirmation rituals of social and moral identities and orders (p. 13, 22, 27).  
When wrongs against the moral order are noted, and a member of that order is expelled 
and then readmitted through the apology process, our identity as a moral community is 
refined and strengthened.  A national collective apology thus refines and strengthens our 
identity as a moral community in opposition to the action which is being apologized for 
as we recommit to our own values. 
Yet, no matter how we define it or the purposes it serves, the idea of collective 
apology is problematic to the individualistic western mind.  We are (unsurprisingly) 
disturbed by the idea of apologizing for acts which we, personally, did not commit.  
Though we frequently refer to collectives as having emotions or attributes (ex. a greedy 
corporation or a healthy community), as Tavuchis (1991, p. 97) notes, “references to 
corporate sorrow or remorse” seem to “push personification beyond its limits”.  Even the 
paying of reparations is troublesome.  Minow (1998, p. 131) argues that “reparations 
elevate things over persons, commodities over lives, money over dignity.”  In discussing 
the apology for the Japanese internment in the U.S, Ben Takashita of the Japanese 
American Citizens’ League stated that while money could not compensate for lost 
freedom, it did show that the apology was “sincere” (quoted in Tavuchis, p. 107).  Yet, 
another Japanese-American who received $20 000 after being interned during his 
wartime childhood stated, “the American government stole four years of my childhood 
and has now put a price of $5 000 for each stolen year” (Lazare, 2004, p. 132).  
Similarly, a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a member of the clergy argued that 
some victims feel like “prostitutes” after receiving financial reparations for being sexually 
violated (Lazare, p. 132; Griswold, 2007, p. 153) while Lazare notes that such 
reparations can even feel like “hush money” in the context of large organizations such as 
the Catholic church (p. 132).  In an article in Le Devoir, one residential school survivor 
sarcastically asks another if she’ll feel “healed” after receiving her settlement, to which 
she and the other survivors in the room could only respond with grim laughter 
(Thohahoken, 2008).  In the article, this first survivor says that it is as if Canada has 
burned down his house yet has offered to pay for the windows, expecting that this will 
settle the score (Thohahoken).  As Minow worries (1998, p. 93), putting a price on 

 
20 
experience such as the death of a child, internment, or torture, trivializes such 
experiences as no amount of money would make up for this suffering.  
Yet, despite the obvious complication of offering collective apologies in nations 
built on an ethic of individualism, and the numerous moral and symbolic difficulties of 
offering reparations for unspeakable crimes, as Lazare (2004) suggests, if we are to take 
pride in things we are not personally responsible for (i.e. national sports teams, famous 
ancestors, etc.) then we also must accept shame for that which we are not personally 
responsible.  If we have national pride, then we must accept national shame (p.41).  
Lazare argues that this pride and shame are part and parcel of what we call a national 
identity (p. 84): they meld and shape our national narratives.  And if our leaders bolster 
themselves with the heroic acts of national ancestors, then they must also accept the 
shame of these predecessors.  Though humans never actually undertook the contract 
which Hobbes describes in Leviathan, we do “in principle” make such a contract as we 
choose one sovereign to represent and personify the group (Burke, 1970, p. 242).  The 
legitimacy of political authority in a democratic nation is based on the agreement to allow 
a group to have agency as if it were an individual by substituting one member for the 
group.  This social contract gives our elected sovereign, as our representative, the right 
to take pride in our successes, and also the ability, and some argue, duty, to apologize 
for our mistakes. 
2.2. The Proliferation of the Public Apology 
Yet despite our ambiguous feelings towards collective apologies, they are 
proliferating.  More than twenty years ago, in his book, Mea Culpa, Tavuchis stated that 
it was impossible to tell whether there had been an increase in the general propensity to 
apologize, yet, due to the global proliferation of “impersonal and legal systems of 
control,” the apology might become “an important means of both personal and political 
reconciliation” (quoted in Lazare, 2004, p. 6).  Lazare sees Tavuchis’ pronouncement 
regarding the then-future of apologies as prophetic because in the two decades since 
the book’s publication, celebrity apologies have kept the tabloid papers in business and 
political apologies have become recurrent headlines of the world’s most respected 
media outlets.  Since Mea Culpa’s publication, Queen Elizabeth has apologized for 

 
21 
seizure of Maori land, Tony Blair has apologized for the Irish potato famine (Harris et al., 
2006, p. 716), President Bill Clinton has apologized for US involvement in the slave 
trade (as well as offering numerous apologies for his sexual indiscretions), Australian 
Prime Minister Kenneth Rudd has apologized to the Stolen Generations, Stephen 
Harper has apologized for the residential schools, Pope Jean-Paul alone made more 
than twenty apologies, and countless other celebrities from comedian Michael Richards 
to golfer Tiger Woods have attempted to apologize for public misbehaviour and private 
indiscretions.   
British socio-linguists Sandra Harris, Karen Grainger, and Louise Mullany (2006, 
p. 716) suggest that, with the exception of requests, in the last two decades, no other 
speech act has generated as much research as apologies.  However, according to Meier 
(cited in Harris et al., p. 717), very little of this research has sought to explain the 
underlying social processes which have contributed to the rise in the public apology such 
as, I add, its relation to narratives of re-covenanting.  Despite this lack of sociological or 
linguistic research on the rise of the public apologies, theories regarding its proliferation 
exist in the popular media and have also been posited from a more psychological 
perspective.  A recent Canadian Broadcast Corporations documentary television 
program argued that the increase of “branding” has led to more apologies as people are 
increasingly concerned with their reputations (de Guerre, 2012).  People such as 
athletes (both professional and amateur) and musicians are gaining a higher percentage 
of their income from endorsements and thus have to be more concerned with 
maintaining a good reputation, making them more keen to apologize when they are 
caught doing something that might mar that reputation.  Others see the increase in 
public apologies since the 1960s as a result of the once-powerless now demanding 
more respect (Lazare, 2004 p. 155): as the status and power of women, people of 
colour, religious minorities, and the LGBT community increases, so do their demands for 
apologies from former oppressors.  Moreover, as Lazare also notes, the increasing 
status of women – who, research shows, generally apologize more frequently than men 
(see Lazare pp. 29 -30) – may also be leading to the proliferation of the apology.  Even 
though women may not be making most public apologies themselves, they may be 
influencing the political and corporate climates from which the apologies arise.  

 
22 
Certainly, new technologies have lead to greater need for public apologies.  With 
globalization made possible by technologies, countries have more opportunities to come 
into conflict with one another thus leading to more chances for misunderstandings and 
offences, thus more reason for apologies.  Lazare (2004) goes so far as to argue that 
because of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the stakes are higher and 
therefore more is being done to prevent war before it happens, including strategically 
apologizing (p. 262).  He also notes that new media mean that once-secret behaviors 
are more frequently revealed, increasing both possible offence-taking and the necessity 
of apology (p. 12).  One can argue that the cell-phone camera alone has necessitated 
numerous public apologies for behaviour which previously would not have been on 
display.  New media also give opportunities for the less advantaged to see what they are 
missing socially, politically, and economically (Lazare, p. 262) meaning that more people 
are demanding apologies for things they never before knew that they were missing.  
Minow (1998) even seems to attribute the rise of the political apology, in part, to the 
“public culture of private feelings” generated by the TV talk show (p. 115).   
The increased speed of the news cycle may also have spurred the coverage, and 
hence our awareness, if not the actual proliferation of the public apology.  Twenty-four 
hour news channels and funding cuts to news agencies mean that journalists are under 
pressure to turn out stories and, as communications theorist Zohar Kampf (2011) notes, 
apologies are an extremely attractive narrative for journalists.  Along with their obvious 
emotional appeal, Kampf argues that bringing transgressions to public attention and thus 
helping to elicit apologies from public figures can be a manner of legitimizing journalistic 
work as it enables them to “perform their role as norm enforcers” (Lazarsfeld and cited in 
Kampf, p. 5)7.  In the case of Stephen Harper’s apology for the residential schoMerton, 
ols, the fact that journalists joined the chorus of the oppressed indigenous peoples who 
had been demanding an apology for years, and thus gave voice to the voiceless, must 
have surely made covering the apology attractive to journalists.  
 
7  
It is worth noting that in his study of Israeli political apology coverage from 1997 to 2004, 
Kampf (2011) found that 49% of apologies were in some way precipitated by journalists 
themselves.  He writes, “many of the actual remedial acts made by transgressors...were 
initiated by journalists in the redress stage, after questioning the wrongdoer during an 
interview about his obligation to apologize or after performing direct mediation between the 
conflicting parties” (p. 80). 

 
23 
In addition, we cannot ignore the significance of the year 2000 as a Jubilee Year 
for Christians around the globe in regards to the proliferation of the public apology.  In 
1994, Pope John Paul II argued that, on the threshold of the new millennium, the church 
should encourage its members to “purify themselves through repentance of past errors” 
(cited in Lazare, 2004, p. 11).  This, coupled with Pope John Paul’s own public 
apologies, gives Christians, particularly Catholics, both an apologizing role-model and a 
spiritual directive to make more apologies. 
More cynically, the proliferation of the public apology may be due, in part, to 
recent research showing the money-saving value of the apology.  In 1991, Tavuchis 
wrote that, “because apology necessarily acknowledges admission and fault… it is likely 
to be interpreted as acceptance of liability and grounds for compensation by authoritative 
third parties [making an apology a] stupid and costly gesture” (pp. 94-95); however, this 
is not the case today.  More recent peer-reviewed research has shown that, at least in 
the medical world, not apologizing may actually cause a patient to file a malpractice-suit 
as it is taken as an insult (noted in Lazare, 2004, p. 173); people may be offering more 
public apologies as their lawyers recognize that it may save them money in the long 
run8. 
The long string of public, particularly, political, apologies in Canada in the last two 
decades has led Canadian English professors Henderson and Wakeham (2009) to 
believe that the proliferation of the public apology, “surely suggests something about 
how nation states currently qualify themselves to belong to the liberal community of 
countries wielding the banner of human rights” (p.3).  I argue that this “something” is the 
discovery that the apology process builds a narrative of re-covenanting that allows us to 
redefine and rededicate ourselves to the values of human rights and equality.  
Henderson and Wakeham insightfully assert that the last two decades of public 
apologies by nation states “speak the kinds of performances through which the sense of 
post-ideological endpoint of history is secured in the west” (p. 3).  The apology for the 
residential schools is a covenant to end all covenants.  It is the confession of the original 
 
8  
One of the articles analyzed quotes a residential school survivor, post-apology, as saying 
“They never moved an inch till the lawsuits started,” (Salutin, June 13, 2008) noting the 
apology process only began after the class-action lawsuits against the government by abuse 
survivors began. 

 
24 
sin of the nation; yet, as Burke informs us, the perfection instinct means that it is not the 
end of the cycle.   
2.3. The Importance of the Apology and the “Predicament 
of Irreversibility” 
In Forgiveness and Revenge, Canadian philosopher Trudy Govier argues that 
the inability to forgive is a blueprint for “lasting hatred, ongoing conflict, and sagas of 
revenge” (cited in Griswold, 2007, p. 93).  In his discussion of the former Yugoslavia, 
Rwanda, and South Africa, Michael Ignatieff writes: 
The past continues to torment because it is not past.  These places are 
not living in a serial order of time but in a simultaneous one, in which the 
past and the present are a continuous, agglutinated mass of fantasies, 
distortions, myths, and lies.  Reporters in the Balkan war often 
discovered, when they were told atrocity stories, that they were uncertain 
whether these stories had occurred yesterday or in 1941 or 1841 or 1441.  
For the tellers of the tale, yesterday and today were the same.  
Simultaneity, it would seem, is the dream time of vengeance.                     
 
 
(p. 186; quoted in Griswold, 2007, p. 192) 
The inability to cleanse the present of the past can lead to the horrors of 
unending cycles of retribution: through apology, we are able to separate the present and 
the past and escape from what Hannah Arendt (1958) calls the “predicament of 
irreversibility.”  Yet, for Arendt, the necessity for forgiveness does not develop merely 
from the need to reconcile and maintain social cohesion following political conflict: it 
arises from the fundamental plural nature of the world.  Arendt’s biographer and former 
student Elizabeth Young-Bruehl (2009, p.52), notes that, whenever we act, our actions 
become part of the complex network of others’ actions and thus their consequences 
become unknowable; thus, we are at risk of becoming “guilty” of consequences of our 
action which we “never intended or even foresaw” (p. 223).  Through the apology, we 
are able to mitigate this frightening prospect via the “possible redemption from the 
predicament of irreversibility”.  As Arendt succinctly states: “being able to undo what one 
has done though one did not, and could not, have known what he was doing – is the 
faculty of forgiving” (p. 237).  Apology and forgiveness allow us to symbolically undo the 

 
25 
past (Griswold, 2007, p. xv) and promote a desirable future by freeing us from the 
“injuries and resentments of the past” (p. 145).  
Of course, this may sound ridiculous, because, aside from invoking some idea of 
time travel through speech act, the very act of forgiveness reminds us of the deed in 
question (Pettigrove, 2006, p.484).  But as philosopher Glen Pettigrove notes, “Our 
actions are partly constituted by their consequences” (p. 486).  In forgiving, we change 
the outcome of the act and thus we do alter the past; we undo the deeds of the past by 
moving them “outside the domain of the natural consequences of the misdeed… 
reinterpret[ing] the perpetrator in the light of the present… and creating opportunities for 
new actions and new relations not determined… by the transgression” (p. 485).  
Tavuchis (1991) also recognizes the time-traveling capability of the apology, although 
perhaps less obviously.  He argues that “the singular achievement of apologetic 
discourse paradoxically resides in its capacity to effectively eradicate the consequences 
of the offence” (p. viii).  The apology has the ability to change the future as it breaks the 
linear process from the offense to consequence.  Tavuchis refers to the apology’s 
“talismanic” (p.5) qualities: the fact that though “no matter how sincere and effective,” an 
apology cannot undo the past, yet this is exactly what it does.  Similarly Griswold (2007) 
points out that the apology attempts to do the impossible by undoing the past (p. xv) and 
Simmel  recognizes this in stating that, “in both conciliation and forgiving lies something 
irrational, something like a denial of what one still was a moment before” (cited in 
Tavuchis, p.36). 
Though Pettigrove’s (2006) discussion of Hannah Arendt and collective 
forgiveness brings to mind the idea of covenanting, he does not use the term itself.  He 
notes that in forgiving, one is promising to behave towards a person in a certain way and 
that forgiveness, therefore, is a commitment to a future not determined by the past: this 
is re-covenanting.  It breaks through the cycle of resentment, retaliation and revenge 
which Bishop Joseph Butler (cited in Pettigrove, 2006, p. 489) discussed.  Because, as 
Arendt (1958) argues, forgiveness is the only action which does not merely react but 
“acts anew… unconditioned by the act of which provoked it.” Through forgiveness and 
apology we are able to return to an ideal past, a Garden of Eden without sin.  In what 
Arendt refers to as a “world-rupturing” or “delimiting” moment, forgiveness brings these 
processes of interaction caused by the initial wrongs to an end and facilitates the 

 
26 
possibility of a new beginning.  In Burkean terms, the apology allows us to return to the 
unified state that existed before the moral order was polluted by the offence.  Through 
the apology we are able to enact the mystical paradox of returning to the past in order to 
move forward and be born again, cleansed of sin.  But in order for us to be cleansed of 
sin, a sacrifice must be offered, a topic I now turn to in a discussion of the apology as a 
secular ritual.   
2.4. Civil Religion and Secular Ritual 
To this point, this chapter has sought to define the terms surrounding collective 
apologies, and to place them into their historical context and examine them from 
philosophical and psychological perspectives.  I now move onto a review of some of the 
literature which predicates my theoretical framework from a more anthropological and 
sociological perspective, beginning with an exploration of the framework alluded to in the 
introduction, that of civil religion and secular ritual.  
In 1922, the German legal scholar Carl Schmitt published Political Theology.  In 
it, he argued “all significant concepts for the modern theory of the state are secularized 
theological concepts” (quoted on Cayley, 2012).  Following Schmitt’s thought; Harvard 
professor of Law and Humanities Paul Kahn notes that, in the West, the secular nation 
state has taken on the role of fulfilling our need for transcendence using religions 
themes.  Yet, as Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics, explains, 
the contemporary ‘myth of the secular’ convinces us that, since the Treaty of Westphalia 
ended the Wars of Religion in 1648, the realms of politics and religion have remained 
separate in Western society.  Kahn argues that this myth hides the fact that our political 
practices are rooted in religious traditions (Cayley).  In my Introduction, I discussed how 
the apology maps onto the framework of Ancient Near-Eastern and Biblical covenant.  In 
the following sections, I expand on this notion of contemporary Canada is not entirely 
secular, but rather, based on the civil religion of liberal democracy, and particularly on a 
devotion to human rights and equality.  This understanding of the importance of civil 
religion in Canada is crucial to my view of Stephen Harper’s apology for the Indian 
Residential School system as a secular ritual of re-covenanting.  

 
27 
2.4.1. 
Religion, Ritual, Social Cohesion and Power 
Coming from the Latin religare -- to bind -- Durkheim (cited in Lemert, 1999, p. 
247) defined religion as “beliefs and practices which united into one single moral 
community…. all those who adhere to them.”  In Durkheimian thought, religion offers 
both cosmological answers and continuity of moral practices leading to social cohesion 
expressed and maintained through ritual.  Neo-Durkheimians such as Robert Bellah, 
Robert Merton and Talcot Parsons argue that religion “or its functional equivalent” 
(Lemert, p. 264) continues to be at the core of all societies.  Although science may have 
taken over much of the role religion once held in answering cosmological questions of 
existence in post- industrial societies, societies still need ritual for social cohesion. 
Given its power as social glue, religion has long been the jumping off point for the 
study of ideology (Bell, 1992, p. 187), and it is therefore not surprising that, since Sir 
James Frazer (1890/1993), historians, sociologists and anthropologists have linked 
notions of ritual to those of political power (Bell, p. 193).  As rituals are fundamentally 
about the public construction of meaning (Brewin, 2011, p. 4), those in power have long 
had a desire to control the encoding and decoding of public rituals.  Though 
Durkheimians have maintained that ritual is a mechanism to maintain social stasis, 
Turner (1969) advanced the notion that rituals were more than just the social glue which 
hold society together but are processes which relate “a world in becoming, not a world in 
being” (cited in Deflem, 1991, p. 17).  This idea has important affinities with Arendt’s 
(1958) notion of a liminal delimiting moment. 
I do not go as far as ritual theorist Catherine Bell (1992) in believing that all ritual 
is a means of constructing “limited and limiting” power relationships (p.8).  Nor do I 
subscribe to political and social theorist Steven Lukes’ claim that “collective 
effervescence” does not so much unite communities as strengthen the power of 
dominant groups (cited in Bell, p. 178).  Although I recognize the hegemonic power of 
ritual, I see both the unifying and reformatory power of ritual in line with American 
communication theorist Robert L. Ivie (2007, p.237) who states: 
 
Rituals are dramatic performances that can draw upon verbal and 
nonverbal symbols jointly to enact and thereby reconstruct political 
motives with sufficient ambiguity to accommodate a diversity of otherwise 
conflicted identities and interpretations.  As a recurring practice, each 

 
28 
ritualized 
reiteration 
combines 
familiar, 
reassuring 
sense 
of        
convention with a creative, experimental individuating facet of 
improvisation, which together can facilitate over time both a renewal and 
modification of national identity, political attitude, and governing 
worldview.  It is at once a conserving and reforming social practice.            
 
 
(Ivie, 2007, p. 237)      
Thus rituals, in performing both conserving and reforming social functions, are 
important secular instruments particularly suited to the task of replacing, in many 
instances, the role formerly played by institutionalized expressions of religiosity.  Rituals, 
in other words, often serve as a kind of secular faith, a notion I now consider in relation 
to Robert Bellah’s (1967) concept of civil religion. 
2.4.2. 
Bellah’s “Civil Religion in America” 
Though the term “civil religion” appears as far back as Rousseu’s Social 
Contract, the concept was long-ignored in sociological thought until the 1967 publication 
of Robert Bellah’s seminal article “Civil Religion in America” (Wimberly and Swatos, 
n.d.).  Bellah argues that the reason that the concept of civil religion had been ignored 
for so long is because of our western understanding of the concept of religion itself “as 
denoting a single type of collectivity of which an individual can be a member of one and 
only one at a time” (1967, p. 116, endnote 1).  He argues that if we instead held the 
“Durkheimian notion that every group has a religious dimension” (p. 116, endnote 1) we 
would be more likely to recognize this dimension of our own society. Bellah defines civil 
religion as the “transcendent universal religion of the nation” (Bellah; cited in Wimberly 
and Swatos, n.d.).  The concept fits in well with the functionalism of Emile Durkheim and 
Bellah’s mentor, Talcot Parsons (Wimberly and Swatos).  Bellah’s work, which focuses 
on civil religion in the U.S.A., is predicated on the notion that the majority of Americans 
share symbols, beliefs and rituals that constitute a civil religion (Bellah; cited in Wimberly 
and Swatos).  Though he does not directly refer to civil religion as being socially 
integrative, he notes that it allows for a common standard of ethics for the nation and its 
leaders.  He urges for a deeper analysis of political events in terms of their religious 
nature stating that, “what people say on solemn occasions need not be taken at face 
value, but it is often indicative of deep-seated values and commitments that are not 
made explicit in the course of everyday life” (Bellah, 1967). 

 
29 
Bellah (1967) argues that civil religion has existed since the founding of the 
United States of America.  American politicians have long-noted the utilitarian purpose of 
religion in the founding and maintenance of the nation.  As George Washington said in 
his farewell address, “Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, 
Religion and Morality are indispensable supports” (quoted in Bellah, p. 6).  Bellah 
recognized similar sentiments in his own time, noting that Dwight Eisenhower was 
reported to have said, "Our government makes no sense unless it is founded in a deeply 
felt religious faith - and I don't care what it is" (quoted in Bellah, p. 3). 
Bellah (1967) states that, “Behind the [American] civil religion at every point lie 
biblical archetypes: Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and 
Sacrificial Death and Rebirth” yet, it is not specifically a Christian narrative as, “it has its 
own prophets and its own martyrs, its own sacred events and sacred places, its own 
solemn rituals and symbols” (p. 18).  He refers to the constitution and the Declaration of 
Independence as “the holy scriptures” and to George Washington as Moses who 
liberates the people from oppression at the hands of tyrants.  Bellah recognized that 
themes of death and rebirth were constant in the rhetoric of the American presidents, 
seeing Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address (which was dedicated at the Gettysburg National 
Cemetery for the civil war dead) as part of an American New Testament in which Lincoln 
symbolically died, just as the soldiers of the civil war actually died, in order for the nation 
to be reborn (Bellah).  Lincoln - “the martyred president” - has long been associated with 
the Christ archetype, and, with Lincoln’s actual death, “the theme of sacrifice was 
indelibly written into the civil religion” (p. 11).  Bellah argues that Memorial Day gives 
ritual expression to the themes of sacrifice and rebirth as “rededication to the martyred 
dead, to the spirit of sacrifice, and to the American vision” (p.11) and recognized these 
themes in his own time with John F. Kennedy's inaugural address of January 20, 1961, 
in which Kennedy said, “We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of 
freedom -- symbolizing an end as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal as well as 
change” (p.1).  These themes of sacrifice and rebirth are essential components of my 
analysis of the apology and its media coverage as a process of re-covenanting. 

 
30 
2.4.3. 
Civil Religion in Canada 
While Paul Kahn argues that the political culture of the United States can only be 
understood in light of its theological foundations of its key concepts, he does not think 
that this is necessarily universally true of every country’s politics (Cayley, 2012).  In the 
1960s, sociologists including Bellah and Seymour Martin Lipset were hesitant to 
acknowledge civil religion in Canada (Kim, 1993).  Bellah blamed our lack of civil religion 
on English Canada’s adoption of Britain’s symbols and rituals as well as the fact that 
Quebec was distinct from the rest of the country (Robert Bellah and Phillip E. Hammond, 
1982).  In a 1976 article, political scientist Dr. John H. Redekop (1976) argued that civil 
religion never flourished in Canada due to factors such as our regionalism, the policy of 
multiculturalism and the fact that “Canada has remained a small or middle power [which] 
has provided relatively little occasion for seeing the country in a saviour role, especially 
as far as military achievements are concerned” (p. 13).   
This lack of civil religion in Canada can no longer be said to be the case (if it ever 
really were).  Particularly since the 1960s and gaining motivation from the Patriation of 
the Constitution, Canadians have attempted to “to legitimate their regime in ultimate 
principles that their adherents see as sacred and incontestable” (von Heyking, 2007).  
Canadian politicians have even been known to use the terminology of such thinking, as 
did justice minister Irwin Cotler when he stated that “human rights has emerged as the 
new secular religion of our time” (von Heyking).   
It has also been argued that since its inception in 1982, The Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms has become the sacred text of our civil religion.  As Daniel Elazar 
investigates in his four volume opus, The Covenant Tradition in Politics, Judeo-Christian 
societies have secularized biblical covenant ideas of “freedom and restraint first as 
‘liberties and obligation’, then as ‘rights and duties,’ and ultimately, as civil and human 
rights” (summarized in Allen, 1999).  In an article, for Cardus, a conservative Christian 
Canadian policy think tank, political science professor John von Heyking (2010) 
professes the typical view of civil religion in Canada, stating:                                                                            
The Charter of Rights and Freedoms has been accompanied by a 
mythology or civil religion that views Canada as the site of the 
progressive unfolding of human potentiality, freedom, and equality.  
Instead of viewing Canadian democracy in limited Lockean terms of 

 
31 
responsible government, and instead of drawing its sacred symbols from 
historical Christianity, it draws its symbols from the “democratic faith” of 
pluralism, tolerance, cosmopolitanism, autonomy, and equality.  The 1867 
Constitution is seen to have been drafted by bigots and racists, and a 
second founding (in 1982) is required to correct the earlier botched job.      
 
 
 (von Heyking, 2010) 
Von Heyking (2010) notes that, in an editorial for The Globe and Mail, Jeffrey 
Simpson referred to justices of the Supreme Court as “legal cardinals,” in that they had 
replaced the church authorities.  Although his analysis reveals many interesting aspects 
of secular rituals in Canada, von Heyking ignores the biblical narratives of covenanting, 
as well as the universal themes of sacrifice and regeneration which are evident in 
Canadian civil religion today.  However, he does bring up the crucial fact that Canadians 
felt a need for a new constitution -- a new covenant for this secular religion.  Bellah 
(1967) argues that civil religion sets a higher standard by which the nation should be 
judged; I believe this has become the case in Canada with a new set of standards, 
presented in The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in light of which our past and present 
national actions are now judged.  This new covenant took shape as a belief in human 
rights and continues to be expressed and maintained, redefined and committed to again, 
through media events such as Stephen Harper’s 2008 public apology for the residential 
schools. 
2.5. The Role of the Media in the Apology Ritual 
In traditional communities, cyclical rituals continually re-define and reinforce 
cultural narratives.  In the contemporary, atomized nation state, we rely on the media to 
convey our national narratives.  As such, it is not surprising that the media’s role in 
public apologies is so significant; indeed, apologies that do not include a media 
component are not seen as adequate9.  With the help of the media, collective apologies 
have the ability “to make history by apologizing for it” (Buck, 2006. p. 97).  By simply 
covering the event, the media initially convey and then reinforce the narrative put 
 
9  
For example, President Clinton’s apology for American involvement in Guatemala was seen 
as insufficient as, “there was no attempt to address the Guatemalan people and/or the 
American public by television or by radio” (Gibney and Roxstrom, 2001, p. 929).  

 
32 
forward by the apology, even when coverage of that apology is not entirely positive; 
thus, the media play a critical role in the ritual that is the apology. 
Some theorists (e.g. Kampf, 2011) have gone so far as to state that it is the 
media that create the “social drama” (Turner, 1967) of the public apology.  Kampf argues 
that the breach stage of the social drama only begins, not with the actual transgression 
of the social norm, but rather with the media calling the transgression to public attention.  
He states: 
the initial act by politicians or organizations cannot be considered as part 
of the social drama... as it is only through journalistic practices -- whether 
involvement in framing the act as offensive or reporting others’ claims 
regarding its offensive nature -- that acts are transformed into 
transgressions. In most cases, without journalists drawing attention to the 
offensive nature of a specific act, no transgression would be identified 
and no discursive struggle would erupt.  
(Kampf, 2011, p. 76) 
The media is an absolutely essential component of the contemporary public 
apology and it is only through this lens that the cultural narrative it presents can be 
understood.  Because of this, I now turn to a review of Dayan and Katz’s (1992) theory 
of media events and position the mediated apology process within the framework of civil 
religion and secular ritual.  
2.6. Media Events 
2.6.1. 
Media and the Public Sphere 
Nancy Fraser (1990) defines the public sphere as “a theater in modern societies 
in which political participation is enacted through the medium of talk" (p.57).  It is the 
space of mediation between the private sphere and the sphere of public authority; in the 
language of Marvin and Ingle (1999), the public sphere allows the totem domain 
(politicians, the police, and the armed forces) to communicate with the popular and 
affiliative (counterpublic) domains.  The media have always been vital to the theory of 
the public sphere.  For Habermas (1992), literacy, access to literature, and critical 
journalism were essential to establishment of the bourgeois public sphere in Europe, and 
as he mused in his 1992 “Further Reflections on the Public Sphere”, the public sphere is 

 
33 
now, more than ever, dominated by the mass media.  Events which happen in the public 
sphere cannot be separated from their media coverage. 
It is not controversial to state that the vast majority of Canadians have no 
physical interaction with federal politicians, do not attend parliament, and do not read 
documents such as the Hansard or Royal Commissions; therefore, the media is the 
manner in which the government puts forward its ideas and in which national narratives 
are created.  The media is essential to strengthening the “imagined community” of the 
nation of Canada.  For this reason, I analyzed both the text of the apology itself and the 
media coverage of the event.  In effect, for the vast majority of Canadians, both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal, the media event of the apology was the apology. 
2.6.2. 
The Media Event as Secular Ritual 
Communication theorists and other scholars have frequently borrowed terms 
from anthropology and sociology (e.g. Victor Turner’s “social drama” (Alexander and 
Jacobs; Wagner-Pacific; all cited in Kampf, 2011) to understand the role of the media in 
society, yet none have resonated as much as Dayan and Katz’s (1992) term “media 
event.”  In an attempt to bring the anthropology of ceremony (e.g. Durkheim, 1912/1995]; 
Handelman; Levi-Straus; all cited in Dayan and Katz, p. 2) together with the study of 
mass communication, neo-Durkheimians Daniel Dayan and Elihu Katz believe that 
media events, as ritual, function to foster mechanical solidarity (p. viii) and note that 
“collective viewing reinforces a shared perspective on reality (p. 177, quoted in Scannel, 
1995, p. 153).  As Dayan and Katz former student Eric W. Rothernbuhler notes, “For us, 
Durkheim’s (1912/1995) book The Elementary Forms of Religious Life was a work of 
communication theory (Rothenbuhler, 1993) and anthropological studies of ritual more 
generally provided important models for re-conceptualizing communication theory” 
(Rothenbuhler, 2009, p. 63.   
According to this line of thinking, the mass media allow public events to be 
available for private consumption (Talbot, 2007, p. 23), fostering solidarity with a larger 
public despite physical isolation.  Dayan and Katz define the media event as a broadcast 
occasion that is “preplanned, announced and advertised in advance” (1992, p. 7), 
treated with reverence and ceremony, that celebrates the core values of the society 

 
34 
(Lukes; cited in Dayan and Katz, p.12).  In his article, “From Media Events to Ritual to 
Communicative Form”, Eric W. Rothenbuhler (2009) adds that the media event has 
come to be understood as often having “serious political and social consequences” (p. 
60).  The apology for the residential schools most certainly fits all these categories as it 
was a long-anticipated, somber affirmation of the government of Canada’s commitment 
to human rights and equality.  
Dayan and Katz (1992) rightly note that while media events can address conflict, 
they celebrate reconciliation (p.8) and the voluntary actions by great men and are, thus, 
generally hegemonic (p.8).  Certainly, we can see that this is the case with the role of the 
great men in the apology process; however, Dayan and Katz believe that, though 
hegemonically sponsored, like all rituals, media events can have the power to transform 
both the symbolic and the real (p. 147) by allowing a nation an opportunity to enter into a 
liminal period in the Turnerian sense.  According to Turner (cited in Dayan and Katz, p. 
104) this liminal period shifts our definition of reality from indicative (what reality is) to 
subjunctive (what reality might or should be) thus inviting us to re-examine the status 
quo (p. 20).  The study of national media events has often focused on the purely 
conservative functions of events such as royal weddings and presidential funerals rather 
than events that seek to transform societies (Mihelj, 2008, p. 472), such as public 
apologies.  Yet, the original collaboration between the American social scientist, Katz, 
and the humanist of the French tradition, Dayan, was born of the study of the media 
coverage of Sadat’s first visit to Jerusalem, an event which produced permanent social 
change.  This paradoxical nature of being both hegemonic and transformative is 
particularly true of the media event of the public apology. In his examination of public 
apologies as Turnerian “social dramas” (Turner, 1969), communications scholar Zohar 
Kampf (2011) argues that “the uniqueness of this type of process is that, in contrast to 
other types of mediatized rituals (Cottle, 2006), it promotes both social disagreement 
and consent and consists of both conflictual and remedial types of discourse in the same 
social process” (2011, p. 73). Like all rituals, media events have both conservative and 
reformatory power. 
In line with Arendt’s (1958) theory of forgiveness, I see that it is through its liminal 
status as articulation of the subjunctive that the media event of the government apology 
has the ability to transform society. Rothenbuhler argues that it is their capacity as ritual 

 
35 
which allows media events to “chang[e] minds, and chang[e] history” (p. 63). Like 
Arendt’s world-delimiting moments, the apology presents to us an essence of the nation 
state, free of previous sins, which is both a return to an idealized past and a glimpse of a 
utopian future while espousing the covenant of dedication to human rights and equality.  
It is in its status as an idealized version of the nation that the process of re-covenanting 
occurs.   
Though it is undoubtedly the case that the media event of the apology itself is 
planned and orchestrated by hegemonic ‘great men’, the role of the journalist in this 
process is critical.  As Kampf (2011) argues, “journalists may use the media’s archive to 
retrieve documented apologies made by previous transgressors in order to compel them 
to conduct themselves in the present in a manner consistent with their words in the past” 
(p. 82).  If Moses’ Israelites begin to worship the Golden Calf again, journalists are able 
to call upon the words of the past to enforce the covenant.   
Despite its “conspicuous presence” the link between the formation of national 
narratives and media events is an under-examined topic (Mihelj, 2008, 473).  As Paddy 
Scannel (cited in Mihelj p. 472) notes, although many of the case studies in Dayan and 
Katz’s (1992) Media Events relate directly to issues of national identity, they remain 
relatively silent on the issue itself.  For Hannah Arendt (1958), the public sphere exists 
for “self-revealing” as much as for mutual understanding (Calhoun and McGowan, 1997, 
p.8).  She saw the public sphere as a kind of “organized remembrance” (cited in 
LaMothe, 2012 p. 3) which comes into being in shared narratives, forging individual and 
collective identities, encompassing social, economic and political beliefs and expressed 
in institutions and secular rituals.  By logical extension, the media, in playing such a 
huge role in the creation of the contemporary public sphere, has a critical role to play in 
creating not only self-identities but national narratives and identities.  Media and cultural 
theorist Sabina Mihelj argues that it is only in brief moments highlighted in media events 
that nations actually do come together as the imagined communities that they are 
always assumed to be (p. 475).  Mihelj goes as far as to say that, given the size of 
contemporary nation states, it is only with broadcasting those efforts at national identity 
building can be successful (p. 476).   

 
36 
The fact that we are not in a traditional society where everyone is in physical 
attendance at public rituals, but must, instead, witness them through the mediation of 
newspapers, television, radio, websites, etc, that the contemporary secular ritual of the 
media event gains greater transformative power.  Media theorists (ex. Benjamin; 
McLuhan; Ong; all cited in Brewin, 2011, p. 20) note that the media text allows for 
distancing and self-conscious separation.  This distancing allows for critique in ways that 
actually attending a ritual does not as it lets one pause and reflect. The media event of 
the public apology allows us to participate in the public sphere by considering and 
critiquing the media event in a manner that would not be possible if we were actually in 
attendance at the secular ritual itself.  As Shiping Tang (2011) argues, for the hegemonic 
powers, the problem with state apologies is that the apologizers want it both ways: they 
want to have credit for apologizing even as they want the world to remain the same.  Yet 
the distancing allowed in the media event allows for too much critique.  However, as we 
will see in my examination of Stephen Harper’s apology for the residential schools, the 
notion of re-covenanting allows for both hegemonic and transformative goals to occur 
through the media event.  With the collective apology, the ‘great men’ doing the 
apologizing are able to take the credit of re-dedicating the society to its already stated 
goals, yet the society’s goals and values are redefined through the apology process 
itself. 
2.6.3. 
The interaction of organizers, broadcasters, and audience 
 Media events have three partners: the organizers, the broadcasters and the 
audience -- and Dayan and Katz (1992) recognize that the meaning of the event is a 
negotiation between these three agents (pp. 54, 55).  In Hall’s (1973) terms, the 
organizers and broadcasters may have control over the encoding of the event, but they 
cannot control the audiences’ decoding.  Organizers and the audience rely on the tacit 
social knowledge of audiences to interpret media events, meaning that the audience is 
involved in an active process of interpretation incorporating their own specific knowledge 
of cultural symbols with the images and information presented to create their own 

 
37 
narrative specific to each individual.10  This is particularly true of the apology process 
which does not make explicit the religious symbols and cultural processes, such as re-
covenanting, which it draws upon.  
As Kim Christian Schroder (2007) notes, both media producers and consumers 
bring their own life experiences and the collective histories of their social groups into 
communicative tasks.  Schroder’s investigation into decoding of ads describes how 
media consumer’s own “communicative repertoires manifest themselves and explains 
that, not only do media consumers produce meaning from the visual and verbal signs 
that are “there” but also from ones that aren’t “there” (p. 79).  They note that television 
directors are always looking for situations that offer a synecdoche of the entire event.  By 
shifting the focus of the coverage from explicit statements to visual cues, audience 
members become active interpreters of the meaning of the event.  This, at once, allows 
them hermeneutic pleasure (p.88) while allowing for interpretative freedom and the 
possibility of counter-readings by audience members.  Following this, my analysis pays 
attention to the visual cues such as physical space, costumes, and body language 
contained in the media coverage. 
It is important to realize that news reports of the apology will take into account 
the narrative of the apology.  When attempting a narrative analysis, one must constantly 
be aware of the subject of study.  While earlier scholars such as Propp (cited in Gulich 
and Quasthoff, 1985, p. 172) restricted their analysis of narrative to the text alone, I 
analyze both the text itself and the act of telling the story.  Factors that I took into 
account included the relationship of the narrator to the audience and the situation in 
which the narration take place. 
 
10  Though this thesis analyzes both the apology itself and the news media coverage of the 
event as, in today’s media saturated public sphere, the meaning of the event is its media 
presentation. However, it is important to note that this study is limited to the apology and its 
media coverage and does not explore audience decoding of the apology apart from the 
analysis of editorials and commentaries in the media itself.

2.6.4. 
 Framing: A Conscious or Unconscious Process? 
 A frame can be defined as the elements of a narrative which encourage us to 
develop a particular understanding of events (1991, p.7; quoted in Robinson, p. 531).  
Frames help us render events meaningful and thereby organize our experiences and 
guide our actions (Benford and Snow, 2000, p. 614). In the field of media analysis, the 
issue of whether framing is a largely unconscious or conscious process is controversial.  
Political scientists Tom Nelson, Rosalee Oxley and Zoe Clawson (1997) note that from 
the spin following political debates to the stage-crafting of press conferences, elites 
(members of the totem domain) spend a considerable amount of time, effort and money 
on how information is presented (p.224).  However, they also note that the framing of an 
issue by news media is not necessarily an “overt attempt at persuasion or 
manipulation[:]” media coverage of issues must be selective as not all known information 
can possibly be presented (p.236).  They insist that frames bridge the gap between elite 
discourse and popular understanding of an issue by concisely presenting complex 
issues (p. 237).  In acting as the realm of the public sphere which conveys the view of 
the sphere of authority to the citizens, the people and institutions which make up the 
media may be trying to follow norms of impartiality, but “they cannot escape the fact that 
the approach to a story implicitly teaches the public how to understand the central issue” 
(p. 236).  Moreover, journalists are not immune to their own biases and the naturalization 
of hegemony; they both self-censor and unconsciously view and present events through 
the lens of the ruling social and political elites (Robinson, 2001, p. 525). 
On the other hand, some theorists (Reese; cited in Konig, n.d.) have gone so far 
as to suggest that framing is always a conscious process.  McAdams (1996, cited 
Karagiannis, 2009), defines framing as “the conscious, strategic efforts by groups of 
people to fashion shared understandings of the world and themselves that create 
collective identities, influence public discourse and legitimize and motivate collective 
action” [my emphasis].  Similarly, what is sometimes referred to as the “manufacturing 
consent” thesis states that the primary function of the media is to encourage support for 
the policy choices of the elite (Chomsky and Herman; Hammond and Herman; Herman; 
all cited in Robinson, 2001, p. 542). 

 
39 
What is clear is that frames, whether consciously created by policy makers and 
media producers or not, depend on interplay with the unconscious knowledge of 
audience members. While agenda setting is the process of deciding which issues get on 
the news, and is therefore a conscious process, framing is a more delicate process that 
encourages audiences to understand an issue in a particular way.  But, unlike 
advertisers, whose use of cultural symbols and meaning systems in order to sell 
products is “undoubtedly intentional” (Barthes; cited in Goldman, 1992, p. 40), this 
conscious effort is not so clear with regards to all framing. My analysis finds the middle 
ground of the debate as to whether framing is a conscious or unconscious process by 
treating framing as an often conscious but more frequently unconscious structuring 
device. This view of framing is key to this thesis as I do not examine whether frames 
were intentionally created or not, but rather, how the existing cultural narrative of re-
covenanting was revealed in the frames used by politicians and the media. 
As cultural theorist Baldwin Van Gorp (cited in Scheufele and Tewkbury, 2007) 
points out, framing is a process based in and bound by culture.  Frames are never 
constructed from scratch (Konig, n.d.) but draw on existing cultural codes.  Whereas the 
hypodermic-needle model of communication once assumed that the media was able to 
inject information into audiences, this model is long-outdated.  In the study of 
advertising, it has long been acknowledged that advertisers “convert the ‘raw material’ of 
already existent meaning systems into hybrid meaning systems that suit their particular 
purposes” (Williamson; cited in Goldman, 1992, p. 38).  That is to say, advertisers use 
the cultural symbols which are always-already endowed with meaning by audiences to 
imbue novel objects with meaning in order to create new narratives.  This is an 
extremely similar process to what I see at work in the framing of the apology where the 
familiar narrative of re-covenanting is replayed.  Sociologists Robert Benford and David 
Snow (2000) argue that a frame must also have “narrative fidelity” (p.622); it must 
resonate with cultural narratives or what Campbell would call “myths” (cited in Benford 
and Snow, p. 622).  They argue that, for a frame to resonate, it must tap into cultural 
narratives, ideologies, practices (p. 624, 629), all of which belong to a “metaphorical tool 
kit” (Swidler, 1986, cited on p. 629). 
  As Nelson, Oxley, and Clawson (1997) state, “frames operate by activating 
information already at recipients’ disposal [that are] stored in long-term memory” (p.225).  

 
40 
Frames bring past experiences and emotion to mind and add additional weight to issues 
(p. 237).  The Harper apology itself and its media coverage was framed in such a way to 
remind audiences of the meaning systems and endow new situations and actors with 
those meanings. The known narrative of re-covenanting was used to imbue meaning 
onto this novel situation of the collective, meditated public apology.  
It is also important to note, as discussed above, that framing works with prior 
knowledge.  This goes against the common sense assumption that the less an individual 
knows about an issue, the more likely they are to be influenced by news media coverage 
of the issue.  As experiments on the framing of the issue of welfare by Nelson, Oxley 
and Clawson (1997) demonstrate, awareness of the issue does not make one immune 
to the impact of framing.  In fact, they found that those who were more knowledgeable 
concerning issues related to welfare were more apt to be influenced by the media frame 
in which the information was presented (p.234).  Such research on framing has great 
importance on who will be influenced by particular kinds of messages and their 
presentation (Nelson, Oxley and Clawson, p. 24).  Although my own brief study of media 
framing will not be examining who was influenced by these frames, Nelson, Oxley, and 
Clawson’s study is important as it somewhat counter-intuitively suggests that those who 
are knowledgeable about the residential schools as well as the themes of re-covenanting 
are even more receptive to the effects of media framing.  
I began this chapter by noting the etymology of the word apology and how it has 
changed from a defense to an expression of remorse and a promise of a better future.  
Perhaps because of this promise, despite its complications, the collective apology has 
proliferated.  This proliferation speaks to the nature of liberal democracies and the 
importance of national narrative.  National narratives are spread through the media, and, 
following Dayan and Katz’s (1992) theory of media events, we are able to understand 
how a secular ritual such as a public apology can have both hegemonic and 
transformative power.  Through the apology we are able to undo the wrongs of the past 
and rededicate ourselves to broken covenants, mending them and redefining our 
relationships to our beliefs and values.

Now that the terms used in this thesis have been defined and their historical 
context explored, I begin to lay the theoretical foundations of my analysis of Stephen 
Harper’s apology for the Indian Residential School system and its media coverage.  In 
the beginning of the last chapter, I noted how notions of apology and forgiveness do not 

 
42 
make sense in perfectionist systems of ethics, such as that of the ancient Greeks, and 
argued that it is only with the belief that humans are flawed that these notions come to 
have moral value.  I begin this chapter by discussing the idea of flawed nature of our 
existence -- its origins and its consequences -- in more detail.  I go on to explain the 
human need for narrative, particularly in response to these feelings of ubiquitous guilt 
and how Burke’s “cult of the kill” allows us to escape from our ubiquitous guilt which I 
discuss in more detail in the next chapter.  Most critically, I discuss the cycle of order, 
pollution, sacrifice and restoration which is the framework I use in the fourth chapter to 
analyze the apology itself.    
3.1. In the Beginning: The Creation of the Sin and the Cycle 
of Redemption 
Human beings around the globe have always felt that things aren’t quite right; our 
relationship to others, the environment, time, even our own bodies, is just somehow 
wrong.  There is an ineffable sense that things should in some way be more unified.  We 
have attempted to explain this feeling of disunity with theories as varied as cosmological 
notions of the Fall from Eden to developmental psychological explanations of the infant’s 
individuation from the mother.  Literary theorist and philosopher Kenneth Burke argues 
that this feeling of division is a function of language itself; logologically, whenever one 
term is divided into classifications, there is a fall from a “vision of perfect oneness” (1970, 
p. 175). He argues that a fall into division is implicit in the notion of creation “insofar as 
the Creation was a kind of ‘divisiveness,’ setting up different categories of things which 
could be variously at odds with one another and which accordingly lack the proto-Edenic 
simplicity of absolute unity” (p. 174).  
Burke argues that just as language creates this division; it also creates sin and 
disobedience.  Beings within a pre-linguistic state of nature are innocent because they 
cannot technically disobey commands as they have no language to understand those 
commands (1970, p. 186); thus, just as Bentham points out that it is only the law that 
can make crime, and Augustine states that it is only the law that can make sin (Burke, 

 
43 
1970, p. 186), in the Burkean logic, it is, even more fundamentally, language which 
creates sin as it allows for the understanding of the law which allows for disobedience11. 
This is Burke’s “theory of the ethical negative” or “theory of ethical linguistics” (Carter, 
1996, p. 4).  
Key to this theory is the idea of the human desire for absolute perfection.  Just as 
humans have always recognized that things ‘aren’t quite right’, we have struggled to 
make them right.  Indeed, according to Burke (1966), one of the most fundamental 
characteristics of humanity is that we are “rotten with perfection” (p. 16): because of the 
fact that we can imagine perfection we are never satisfied with anything less than it.  As 
perfection, by definition, is unattainable, we are never satisfied with our present 
condition.  In terms of Burke’s theory of the ethical negative, our desire for perfection 
means that we are constantly drawn to create broader and broader categories as our 
ethical categories are never good enough.  He argues that our desire for perfection 
eventually drives us to place everything into either a positive or negative ethical 
category.  Eventually, these linguistic motives lead us to construct a system of 
commandments (ethical imperatives) so complex that no one could possibly follow it.  
The result of this inability to follow all the commandments is a sense of “ubiquitous guilt” 
(p. 5) -- what is more commonly referred to in the protestant West as original sin.  
Because of the fact that we can imagine a perfect ethical system, we will always be 
disappointed by anything less than this perfection, leading to this ubiquitous guilt.  
Because of our condition of being trapped inside a web of commandments, we begin to 
think of everything in terms of obedience and disobedience.  The only way that we are 
able to reconnect with the time before we constructed this ethical system is through the 
cycle of the “the cult of the kill”: the cycle of order, pollution, sacrifice, and restoration of 
the order, which I see in terms of Abrabamic re-covenanting and the more universal 
process of totem regeneration.  Just as Arendt argued that apology and forgiveness 
allows us to escape from finality of our actions and their unknowable consequences, we 
 
11  To better explain his often difficult to follow logic, Burke (1970, p.175) works through the 
terms in the reverse order to help us understand how one implies the other.  He begins with 
punishment, noting that any concept of punishment implies the concept of an infraction which 
has made the punishment relevant. In the idea of infraction there is, of course, an implied set 
of conditions.  Burke then argues that from this set of conditions, the notion of a first set of 
conditions, which would imply a creation which allowed for the disobedience. 

 
44 
are only able to escape from the ubiquitous guilt caused by our unachievable moral 
system via a similar process.  In my analysis of Stephen Harper’s apology for the 
residential school system, I see how the escape which both Burke and Arendt spoke of 
was attempted via a narrative of re-covenanting.  The narrative of re-covenanting 
followed the cycle of Burke’s (1962) cult of the kill, substituting the humiliation of the 
apology for the sacrifice, to mend the broken covenant and escape from the 
“predicament of irreversibility”. In the next section, I discuss our need for narrative in 
general and, more specifically, the significance of Burke’s cycle: order, pollution, 
sacrifice and redemption.  I expand upon how this cycle allows us to re-covenant 
through apology thus returning to the unity before the transgression occurred and 
escape from our feelings of disunity and ubiquitous guilt. 
3.1.1. 
The need for the narrative of Order, Pollution, Sacrifice, and 
Redemption 
Canadian literary critic and theorist Northrop Frye explains how creating 
narratives enables us to, “recapture, in full consciousness, that original sense of identity 
with our surroundings,” (cited in Carter, 1996, p. 49) referencing Burke in saying that, in 
order to make sense of our history, humans create “fictive concerns, with origins and 
ends such as give meaning to lives and poems” (cited in Carter, p. 52).  Burke explains 
that human beings have a tendency to make the present condition the result of past 
events.  We imagine that in the distant past, there was an Eden of total oneness, a 
golden age of the prophets, a time when the spirit world and the earthly world were 
united, a Dreamtime before the cracking of the cosmic egg.  Because of the fact that our 
perfectionist linguistic system has trapped us inside a web of commandments which we 
cannot always follow, we think that it is our disobedience of this system that has caused 
this feeling of ubiquitous guilt and disunity, we invent a fall from the Edenic unity, we 
blame our feeling of ubiquitous guilt, not rightly on the characteristics of our drive for 
categorical perfection, but on an ancestral crime; thus creating the first two stages of the 
narrative of order, pollution, sacrifice and redemption.  In the Christian tradition, this is 
the doctrine of original sin.  Our common ancestor, Adam, did something so terrible that 
his guilt is passed down from generation to generation; thus, we must live, fallen, in this 
present state of disunified non-perfection.  Burke recognized that such origins, though 

 
45 
they permeate our culture with notions of a cause and effect for our current, disunified 
condition, are “less the cause of subsequent failures than a symbol of failure in 
retrospect” (Carter, p.32).12  
Yet, we do not realize that our lack of unity is a result of our drive for perfection 
and our need to explain our current condition through a logical, though mythic narrative.  
Instead, we attempt to rectify our condition and return to the state of unity from which we 
fell, using the same method which got us into trouble in the first place: language, which 
is entwined in this drive for perfection.  Burke warns us about this desire to create 
narratives to explain our current condition in stating that, “the search for a cause is itself 
the search for a scapegoat, as Adam blames Eve, Eve blamed the serpent, the serpent 
could have blamed Lucifer, and Lucifer could have blamed the temptations implicit in the 
idea of Order”  (1970, p. 191).  Countless religious historians, anthropologists and 
sociologists have discussed the rituals we create to assign such blame (e.g. Durkheim, 
1912/1995; Eliade, 1965; Frazer, 1890/1993; Girard 1977, 2001).  The most powerful of 
these rituals is the sacrifice of the scapegoat in an attempt to expel sin and return to the 
lost unity. 
Most of us are familiar with the ancient Hebrew practice of confessing the sins of 
the community to a goat, then casting the goat into the desert, leaving the community 
free of sin (Leviticus 16).  The Hebrew term la-aza’zeyl, commonly translated as 
scapegoat, literally means “the sender away (of sins)”. Historians note that this practice 
goes back to at least the 24th century BCE (Zatelli, 1998, p.245 - 263). The story of the 
two goats brought into the courtyard of the Temple of Jerusalem at Yom Kippur 
illustrates the difference between sacrifice and scapegoating which I alluded to in the 
Introduction to this thesis.  On the day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), the High Priest cast 
 
12  Expanding on our tendency to create narrative, Burke argues that we also define things 
alternatively as a “statement of the thing’s source or beginnings” or, “narratively in terms of its 
fulfillment or fruition”. He states, “the ultimate of such definition being perhaps the use of 
‘bastard’ as an epitaph to describe a man’s character’ (1962, p. 13, quoted in Carter, 1996, p. 
33).  Burke refers to this phenomenon as the “time essence ambiguity as it is reflected in the 
realm of the Symbolic” (p. 439, quoted in Carter, p. 34).  He argues that this allows for both a 
linear and timeless relationship between incidents in a narrative which allows for them all to 
be collapsed into philosophical first principles (Carter, p. 36).  More pointedly, Burke argues 
that we “resort to myth” in order to justify the current social order (1966, p. 364-365, cited in 
Carter, p. 40)      

 
46 
lots for two goats: one was given as a burnt offering while the other took on the sins of 
the community and was sent out into the wilderness (Leviticus 16: 22).  What is 
important to note here is that, unlike the current, popular usage of the term, a scapegoat 
is not simply an innocent victim, rather, the scapegoat symbolically takes on the sins of 
the community so that that community can be cleansed and order can be restored.   
Of course, the people of the ancient middle-east were fond of sacrificing more 
than just goats; one of the most important myths of western civilization, the tale of 
Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22), is a reference to the ancient Semitic practice of 
sacrificing the first born son to the tribal god.  Mircea Eliade recognized that ritual murder 
was an unfortunate necessity for the continuation of the cycle of life for thousands of 
years across a large proportion of human cultures; his History of Religious Ideas lists 
examples of human sacrificial rites from the ancient Chinese to Vedic Indians; to 
European Druids and Mesoamericans, (cited in Carter p. 84); while Sir James George 
Frazer (p.578) informs us of how, in Ancient Greece, a beggar or cripple, referred to as 
the pharmakos, was killed or driven out of the community in times of crisis such as 
famine, plague or invasion (Frazer, 1890/1993, p. 578). 
Kenneth Burke goes so far as to say that in performing “the role of vicarious 
atonement,” the scapegoat mechanism “serves as the overall category for all human 
relations” (cited in Carter,1996, p. 83).  Scapegoating is the key component of the most 
important mythology of western civilization, The Bible, as, according to Exodus, no 
relationship with the Judeo-Christian god is possible without constant cleansing through 
the cycle of sacrifice, forgiveness and restoration (Scofield; cited in Burke, 1970, p.224). 
Burke’s explanation of the scapegoat mechanism can be simplified to a cycle of 
“order, pollution, guilt, purification, redemption” (Shultz, 2000, p. 169).  In his Rhetoric of 
Religion, Burke (1970) gives this more complex explanation of his general theories using 
the Old Testament as an example: 
One can start with the creation of a natural order (though conceiving it as infused 
with a verbal principle): one can next proceed to an idea of innocence untroubled 
by thou-shalt-not’s, one can next introduce a thou-shalt-not; one can depict a 
new Covenant propounded on the basis of this violation, and with capital 

 
47 
punishment; one can later introduce the principle of sacrifice… Then gradually 
thereafter, more and more clearly, come the emergence of the turn from mere 
sacrifice to the idea of outright redemption by victimage. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Burke, 1970, p. 216) 
Shultz (2000) explains that this narrative, which involves themes of 
“transgression stigma, banishment, purification, and ideally redemption, is a means of 
restoring faith in institutional and ideological hierarchies” (p. 171).  According to Burke’s 
logic, we order our societies by creating symbolic hierarchies which are maintained not 
only through institutions, but also through stories and narratives (Shultz p. 171).  When 
we reject traditional hierarchies, we experience guilt and must find a sacrifice to purge 
our guilt and feel redeemed, inventing morality plays (Shultz, p. 172) to purify the 
pollution and assigning guilt to an ‘Other’ to act as a vessel for sin.  In casting out the 
one who bears the burden of our sins, the group can feel relieved of evil, at least 
temporarily (Carter, 1996, p. 18).  In short, the scapegoat mechanism allows us to return 
to our original state before the transgression occurred. 
To illustrate how familiar this model actually is, let us imagine a village in the 
distant past which suddenly became cursed by a sexually transmitted disease.  There 
was an established Order: monogamous marriages, which was Rejected and thus 
became Polluted.  To cleanse the community, the village elders find someone to blame 
for tempting men and causing disease, putting the burden of the community’s sins on to 
her and she is stoned to death.  Lo and behold, after the woman is stoned the 
community is unified.  The women have wailed and thrown stones with their husbands at 
this common enemy.  They have become united once again in the act of Sacrifice: the 
Order has been restored.  Indeed the order has been restored to such a degree that it 
seems as though the stoning of the woman, the scapegoat herself, magically caused the 
rebirth of the community.  The process is not recognized as causing the unity, but rather, 
the scapegoat alone is seen as the cure for the troubles.  The community is unified 
through the narrative of the scapegoat who is then seen to have the divine healing 
power to unify the community. 
But this example was just a temporary cure for a minor Pollution of the Order.  
There needs to be a cure for the fundamental Pollution of the Order that has made it all 

 
48 
wrong: a cure for The Fall.  The perfect sin, of course, demands the perfect sacrifice. 
Christianity found the answer in god sending the ultimate sacrifice, Jesus Christ, to 
atone for Adam’s ultimate sin of disobedience through death.  When Jesus was killed, it 
united the believers to such an extent that it proved he was god. And just as the early 
20th century legal scholar Schmitt noted that, for many in the west, the state had 
replaced the church as the site of transcendence, early 21st century legal scholar Paul 
Khan explains the nation has become the site for sacrifice.  Indeed, it is the fact that the 
state has become the most appropriate place of sacrifice which proves that it is a place 
of transcendence (noted in Cayley, 2012).  In this case, what form would this perfect 
sacrifice take if it were to pay for the original sin of a nation?  The head of the nation 
must be sacrificed for the nation to be unified once again.  In the next section, I explore 
Burke (1959, 1962, 1970) and Girard’s (1977, 1987, 2001) notion of the head of the 
community as the substitute sacrifice of the community as a whole by introducing the 
Durkheimian (1912/1992) notion of the totem as a symbol of the group’s commitment to 
itself.  I show how, through the sacrifice of the totem leader, the community as a whole is 
cleansed and can thus redefine its values and identity in a process of re-covenanting.  
3.1.2. 
The Concept of the Totem 
Though he did not deal with politics to the extent that he examined myths and 
literature, Burke noted that, logologically, “the idea of ‘Lord’ (or Master) applies equally to 
supernatural and worldly governance.”  Burke openly asks what happens to our need for 
a “Sacrificial King” in the “era of Post-Christian science” (1962, p. 31; Carter, 1996, p. 
25), speculating that “for a purely worldly order of motives, we should expect a 
correspondingly worldly kind of ‘defilement,’ with its call for a correspondingly worldly 
need of cleansing by sacrifice” (1970, p. 224).  As the French Romantic Nationalist 
Michelet wrote, “my noble country, you must take the place of the god who escapes us” 
(quoted in Babik, 2006, p. 379).  Whereas theorists such as Girard (1977, 1987, 2001) 
point out that the ultimate religious scapegoat, capable of forming a whole new covenant 
and washing away original sin, is god himself (as exemplified by Jesus Christ), in a 
secular context the ultimate community scapegoat must be the god of the community: its 
totem in whatever form it takes.   

 
49 
I take the notion of the totem as the centre of the cult from Durkheim (1912/1995) 
who theorized that the totem was the ultimate symbol of the group’s commitment to 
itself.  Durkheim argued that the profane routines of daily life weaken the commitments 
of the group and hence the power of the totem.  He argued that for societies to 
overcome their individualistic tendencies, they must continually come together in ritual to 
recreate themselves, thus regenerating the power of the totem.  What is implied is that 
participants in such rituals become “more committed to shared beliefs and institutions of 
their respective communities after such participation than they were before” (Etzioni, 
2000. p. 47). In regenerating the totem, the group regenerates itself, redefining and 
strengthening its own identity and values in a new covenant. 
Though Durkheim (1912/1995) did refer to the totem as the “flag” of primitive 
societies, he was hesitant to apply the concept in reverse; that is, he never stated that 
flags or other symbols of nations had totemic qualities.  However, national politicians 
have never shied from using Durkheimian concepts to describe the nation.  In his 
inaugural speech, Lyndon Johnson pronounced that America was a nation of “believers 
who believed in themselves” (cited in Marvin and Ingle, 1999, p. 18).  Inadvertently or 
not, Johnson was making the Durkheimian pronouncement that nations are defined as 
worshipping the totem of themselves. 
Recently, several theorists have attempted to map the Durkheimian notions of 
the totem onto post-industrial societies with updated references to Bellah’s (1967) notion 
of civil religion.  Adding the theories of Rene Girard to traditional Durkheimian 
scholarship, communications theorist Carolyn Marvin and clinical psychologist David W. 
Ingle (1996, 1999) argue that national identity is built on sacrifice.  They argue that 
secular, nationalist religions “organize killing energy by committing devotees to sacrifice 
themselves to the group” (1996, p. 767).  Agreeing with theorists such as Dayan and 
Katz (1992), Marvin and Ingle see the media as the most important propagator of this 
civil religion and its totem rituals.  They rightly argue that:  

 
50 
the familiar claim that a religious view of the world is characterized by a 
moral opposition to violence ignores a more complex reality in which 
faiths that most deeply bind the commitment of devotees are structures 
for organizing killing energy.  This is true both for religions that 
aggressively kill the ‘other’ in the name of a deity or deities and those that 
pledge their devotees to self-sacrifice when confronted with violence.”  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Marvin & Ingle, 1996, p.768) 
Marvin and Ingle (1999, pp. 6 – 8) theorize that totem rituals are played out in 
domains.  The totem domain is comprised of politicians and the armed forces that are 
charged with protecting the totem.  In Habermasean (1989) terms, this is “the sphere of 
public authority.”  Marvin and Ingle (1999) argue that the totem domain must offer 
sacrifices to the totem in order to keep it alive: soldiers sacrifice their own lives and 
politicians symbolically sacrifice themselves through rituals such as elections in which 
they are humiliated in hopes of being born again, regenerated.  Citizens occupy the 
popular domain and help to maintain the totem through fertility rather than sacrifice.  The 
affiliative domain is made up of groups who contend that they represent the society, as it 
ought to be, and may even oppose the totem:  affiliative groups can be thought of in 
more familiar contemporary sociological terms as subaltern counterpublics.  Marvin and 
Ingle give examples as varied as the KKK, the Black Panthers, the Hell’s Angels, 
Quakers, and Freemasons as affiliative groups in the USA.  In his response to the 
apology, Phil Fontaine states that “we [First Nations] are and always have always been 
an indispensable part of the Canadian identity.  Our peoples, our history and our present 
being the essence of Canada.  The attempts to erase our identities... impoverished the 
character of this nation” (“Response of Phil Fontaine”, 2008).  I see the First Nations as 

 
51 
our most important affiliative group in Canada; though they sometimes may oppose the 
totem, they also present themselves, at least themselves in the historical past, as 
representing the society as it ought to be, with a healthier respect for the community, 
elders, and the environment. 
As Eliade (1965, p. 11) notes, while the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors 
took possession of land in the name of Jesus Christ, the English took possession in the 
name of the King or Queen of their nation.  Combine this with Robspierre's 
pronouncement that in order for France to be reborn, Louis XVI must die (Cayley, 2011) 
and one realizes that in looking for a totem leader of the English and French settler-state 
of Canada, we must not turn to an overtly religious totem, but to the ruler of the secular 
nation.  For contemporary political theorists such as Marvin and Ingle, in post-industrial 
societies, this ritual of the killing of the totem is generally not completed through death 
but rather accomplished through the humiliation of the totem domain leader via election 
campaigns or, as I argue, the more recent phenomenon of public apologies.  This 
scapegoating of the totem domain leader is necessary for the purification through 
regeneration of the essence of the nation and thus, complete re-covenanting to rebuild 
and maintain a national identity through the cycle of order, pollution, sacrifice, and 
redemption.      
 
In this section I have tied Durkheimian notions of totem regeneration through the 
sacrifice of the totem leader to Burke’s rhetorical cycle of the Cult of the Kill and the 
scapegoat.  In addition, I addressed how these ancient universal cycles, and particularly 
scapegoating, are addressed in the current media age with relation to Dayan and Katz 
(1996) theory of media events and Marvin and Ingles’ (1996, 1999) exploration of totems 
and nationalism.  In the next section, I expand on the issue of defining identity in 
opposition to the scapegoat and its relation to the project of re-covenanting. 
3.1.3. 
Defining Identity in Opposition to the Scapegoat 
In The Interpretation of Dreams (cited in Burke, 1966), Freud laid great 
importance on the processes of “condensation” and “displacement.”  Burke (1966) 
extends this work to focus on not just dreams, but all of our symbolic communications.  

 
52 
Burke saw Freudian displacement as simply a confused form of substitution.  To explain 
the ubiquitousness of substitution, Burke gives the examples of translating languages or 
systems such as Fahrenheit to Centigrade and wittily states that “we can paraphrase a 
statement; if you don’t get it one way, we can try another way” (p.7).  Burke even saw 
“penance, expiation, compensation, paying of fines in lieu of bodily punishment, and the 
cult of the scapegoat” all as different forms of the symbolic act of substitution.         
For Burke (1962), the scapegoat, as the part which takes on the burden of the 
whole, must be “profoundly consubstantial with those who, looking upon it as a chosen 
vessel, ritualistically cleanse themselves by loading the burden of their own iniquities 
upon it" (p. 406).  The group must first identify with the victim in order to cast him/her out 
of their ranks after having burdened their sins upon him/her.  It is through this process 
that the lines of identification are redrawn to exclude the scapegoat.  As Burke explains: 
We have here: (1) original state of merger, in that the iniquities are shared 
by both the iniquitous and their chosen vessel; (2) a principle of division, 
in that the elements shared in common are being ritualistically alienated; 
(3) a new principle of merger, this time in the unification of those whose 
purified identity is defined in dialectical opposition to the sacrificial 
offering. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (Burke, 1962, p. 406) 
We see that just as the scapegoat is chosen from the group, it also serves to 
maintain and enhance the group’s coherent identity: there is a symbolic need for the 
unity found through a common foe (1962, p. 408; quoted in Carter, 1996, p. 21).  As 
Carter explains, the function of the scapegoating ritual is “to recruit allies who name 
things in the same polarized terms as we do and agree upon who should be the victims 
and who the victimizers.  We bring all the rhetorical resources of a story to our efforts to 
define ourselves against a common foe,” (Carter, p. 48).  Carter sees the Burkean 
scapegoat as a “fulcrum around which pivot self-justifying identification and separation” 
(p. 18)  
Drawing on Burke, controversial French historian and philosopher Rene Girard 
also pays particular attention to the fact that rituals of vilification are a way for the group 
to form an identity in contrast to the “other” (cited in Ivie, 2007, p. 238).  Whereas 
Durkheim (1912/1995) saw group disintegration as a more passive occurrence which 
arose from the solitary nature of mundane tasks, for Girard, hostility actively threatened 

 
53 
group solidarity and the only way to save the community was through the process of 
scapegoating.  He argues that in very long conflicts, the original reason for the conflict is 
forgotten, and factions then choose an arbitrary scapegoat as the cause.  Everyone can 
then realign themselves in opposition to this scapegoat, not each other.  In his own, 
extreme way, Girard is a true Durkheimian, arguing that the ritual victim acts like a 
magnet pulling in the scattered iron fillings of individuals into a cohesive group (Cayley, 
2011). 
Burke referred to this process as the “dialectic of the scapegoat”.  He claims that 
this dialectic could be seen from the beginning of civilization right up to the present day, 
citing examples of the scapegoating of “Jews, foreigners, Negroes, ‘isms’, etc.” (cited in 
Carter, 1996, p. 19).  Yet Burke did not see scapegoating as some kind of remnant of an 
earlier age; instead, he saw the process as a device intrinsic to the language-using 
animal.13  He followed Aristotle’s rhetorical analysis seeing antithesis as an 
“exceptionally effective rhetorical device... giving dramatic saliency and at least apparent 
clarity to any issue” (1966, p.19).  As he writes, “one may find himself hard put to define 
a policy purely in its own terms, but one can advocate it persuasively by an urgent 
assurance that it is decidedly against such and such” (1966, p. 19).  In a modern 
context, he notes how often leaders will deflect domestic criticism by focusing animosity 
on the evils of another country’s policies (1966, p.19).  Thus, “antithesis helps reinforce 
unification by scapegoat” (1966, p. 19).  Burke notes that our need for unification through 
a common enemy, is, “reducible to the antithetical nature of dialectical [and diacritical] 
terms... that derive their significance from their relations to opposite terms” (cited in 
Carter, p. 21).  
In Burke’s “theory of linguistic diacritics” (or “principle of the social diacritics of 
identity”), we define ourselves against others, just as we define terms, through opposites 
(cited in Carter, 1996, p. 138).  Just as structuralists view words as pairs of binary 
oppositions, Burke views our own identities as oppositional word-constructions (Carter, 
p. 138).  We build personal and groups identities through words in opposition to others 
 
13  C. Allen Carter (1996) eloquently sums up Burke’s view of the deep roots of the mechanism 
to humanity and linguistics by stating that, “When alphabets are tossed in the air, they are 
likely to land in the pattern of a scapegoat” (Carter, p. 109). 

 
54 
and other groups through sets of opposing terms (Carter, p. 6).  As Carter states, “we 
constantly place ourselves with ‘this’ and separate ourselves from ‘that’ (p. 6).  Burke 
repeatedly stresses the importance of the negative in identity formation.  He notes that 
etymologically the word country comes from contra meaning “over against” (1966, p. 
423): we are united as a nation by what we oppose. 
Moreover, these opposing terms are ethically charged, always implying that one 
ought to be this way and not that way (Carter, 1996, p. 7), black or white, wrong 
or right.  In addition, in keeping with his linguistic theory of perfectionism, we are 
constantly striving for the perfection of these opposing terms.  As noted earlier, 
our drive for perfection eventually leads us to place everything on one or the 
other side of the equation; with us or against us.  We even place god on one-
side, assumedly, our side, leading to the idea that we are god’s chosen people 
(Carter, p. 7).  According to Burke’s colleague, friend and mentee William H. 
Reuckert, the theory of ethical negatives leads us into a covenant defined by 
terms which no one can keep; this, in turn, leads to the cycle of purging and 
redemption (Carter, p. 13): the order is so complex that it is constantly being 
broken, bringing about a need for cleansing through sacrifice of a scapegoat in 
order for the order to be restored.  
As discussed in the Introduction, in including an extensive list of past sins, as 
Stephen Harper did in his apology for the residential schools, the apologizer is actually 
providing the community with a list of ‘thou-shalt-nots’.  As the perfect scapegoat for the 
sins of the community is the leader of the community, s/he becomes our Moses, 
presenting us with a new covenant. 
3.1.4. 
Words as medicine  
 
 
 
 
 
At the foundation of the apology process and Truth and Reconciliation 
Commissions around the world is the belief in the medicinal power of words.  Despite the 
modern associations, the idea of talk therapy did not begin with Freud.  In Phaedrus, 
Socrates discusses the curative power of rhetoric while Gorgias compares the effects of 
speech on the soul to the power of drugs on the body (cited in Woods, 2009, p.4).  In 
Philosophy of Literary Form (cited in Woods, p.5), Burke refers to poets as “medicine 

 
55 
men” dishing out spiritual and homeopathic cures.  He described the effect of words on 
the body itself, noting, “both drugs and poetry can be figured as transformative 
substances… both induce affective change, and both tap into bodily rhythms, creating 
and increasing receptivity” (cited in Woods, p. 7).  
Communications theorist Carley S. Woods (2009) argues that, like Freud, Burke 
believed that talk therapy could cure ills (p. 7); however, where Freud dealt with the 
personal, Burke dealt with the social.  It is obvious that talk-therapies for both social and 
personal ills is common in Canada in general, as evidence by psychologists, counselors, 
twelve-step groups, etc., but it should also be noted that Indigenous Canadians have a 
tradition of using words as medicine to heal not just the individual, but society.  Aside 
from the practices of chanting and shamanistic incantations, Jo-Ann Epiniskew, Metis 
Professor of English at the First Nations University argues that, “not only does 
Indigenous literature respond to and critique the policies of the Government of Canada, 
it also functions as ‘medicine’ to help cure the colonial contagion by healing the 
communities that these policies have injured” (cited in Henderson and Wakeham, 2009).  
Often occurring in conjunction with the apology process, the most well known of the 
modern attempts at using words to heal a sick society is that of the Truth Commission, 
also a form of catharsis.  As Martha Minow (1998) notes, in citing a common a truism: 
“Know the truth and it will set you free, expose the terrible secrets of a sick society and 
heal that society” (p. 66). 
However, Burke also noted the power of the orator not as healer but as 
charlatan.  It is not coincidental that both A Grammar of Motives and A Rhetoric of 
Motives were published on the eve of the McCarthy era (Carter, 1996, p. xiv).  In “The 
Rhetoric of Hitler’s Battle”, Burke refers to the scapegoating of the Jews as “snake-oil for 
the social ills of Europe pre-WWII” (cited in Wood, 2000, p. 8).  In Philosophy of Literary 
Form, Burke notes how Hitler’s scapegoating of the Jews was consistent with the Greek 
pharmakon: it performed “purification through dissociation” (cited in Woods, p. 8).  Burke 
believed that reading Mein Kampf could serve as an inoculation against a dictator arising 
in the United States (Eddy, p. 64; cited in Woods, p.9), a vaccination for the masses 
against the snake oil of fascist rhetoric.  

 
56 
3.2. Canada’s Original Sin   
 
Particularly in comparison to our neighbors to the south, Canadians have much 
to be smug about.  As Maclean’s Magazine brags, we are richer than Americans, live 
longer than the Swedes, and have more lovers than the Italians (Gatehouse, 2009).  But 
we have one national shame -- the status of our aboriginal people.  Aboriginal people’s 
life expectancy is between 5 and 8 years less than the Canadian national average (“Life 
Expectancy”, 2010), aboriginals are three times more likely to commit suicide (Kirmayer 
et al., 2007) and twice as likely to live in poverty (Collin & Jenson, 2009).  In a country 
which boasts of equality among its citizen, this is a glaring inconsistency.  No matter how 
much money we throw at this problem, it is not getting better.  Following the Burkean 
logic of the natural human instinct to create a narrative to explain our current situation, 
we decide, not entirely wrongly, that our ancestors must have done something so terrible 
that we carry the guilt from generation to generation.  Our history of colonization is our 
original sin and the most dreadful act of this colonization was stealing aboriginal children 
from their families.  To improve our present situation and re-create unity within the 
nation, we must follow the universal, ancient cycle of order, transgression, sacrifice and 
restoration.  We must pay for this sin with a sacrifice or its symbolic and functional 
equivalent: the humiliation of confession and apology.  For the original sin of the nation, 
the sacrifice of a mere citizen is not sufficient; only by the sacrifice of the god of the 
secular religion can the original sin of the nation be paid for and all the citizens find unity 
in freedom from the burden of this sin.  Only the head of the secular state, the 
representative of the nation itself, is a worthy and sufficient sacrifice.  Through the 
humiliation of public confession and apology the representative of the nation provides a 
list of sins which become our thou-shalt nots and thus redefines and strengthens our 
national narrative of unity and commitment to human rights as embodied in The Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms. 
This chapter has laid out the complex interconnections of anthropological, 
historical, religious, rhetorical, and sociological theories which I now use as a framework 
to analyze Stephen Harper’s 2008 apology for the residential schools.  I began by 
discussing the universal feeling of disunity and ubiquitous guilt that Burke argues are a 
product of our perfectionist linguistic system.  Out of the human desire for a logical 

 
57 
narrative to explain these feelings, we created a “Fall” from an original unity and the 
need to repeat the cycle of order, transgression, sacrifice, and redemption in an attempt 
to regain the unity before the original transgression.  I tied this Burkean cycle to the 
anthropological concept of the totem and the prime minister or president as the 
representative of the totem of the modern nation state.  Following the Burkean logic, I 
argued that, in our times it is the head of the nation who must be sacrificed in order for 
the moral order to be restored as it existed before the transgression.  With the help of 
the media event of the ritual of public humiliation through apology, the head of the nation 
lays out our sins and helps the nation to create a new covenant.  I also noted how the 
entire apology process is founded on the notion of words as medicine.  I finished this 
chapter by applying this narrative to Canada’s sin of the Indian Residential School 
system and the apology for that sin.  It is through this complex web of interdisciplinary 
theories that I analyze this apology and its media coverage. 

 
58 
4. 
Analysis: From a Sad Chapter to a New Dawn 
Religious theorist Walter Burkert (1987) notes that despite the use of empirical 
methods, all data in the humanities “remains [inside a] framework [of] the hermeneutical 
process that is ineradicably subjective” (p. 150).  He argues that “an absolutely objective 
scientific theory would not be gratifying as long as we endeavor to “understand” the 
phenomena, to assimilate them into our own outlook on life” (p. 149).  As media historian 
Roland Marchand (1985) asks in regards to his analysis of American ads between the 
1920s and 1940s, “[o]f what value [is] a systemic analysis of the overt elements of 
advertising when subtle nuances often lay at the heart of their appeals?  Almost by 
definition, nuances defy quantification and categorization” (p. xvi).  I view this analysis of 
the framing of political communications in much the same way.  The subtle, arguably 
subconscious allusions to shared cultural narratives and systems of meaning are often 
not measurable.  For this reason, although this analysis is essentially a framing analysis 
of Stephen Harper’s 2008 apology for the Indian Residential School System and its 
media coverage, it is by no means an empirical study, replicable by other researchers.  
Instead, it is my own assimilation of the media texts, previous research on public 
apologies, and the sociological, rhetorical and anthropological theories covered in the 
last chapter.  Creating meaning from texts is not a passive process; it requires active 
participation.  Like the framing process itself, my interpretation is shaped by my own 
prior knowledge and understandings of cultural processes and narratives.  With this 
caveat, I dive into the heart of this thesis: my findings of the key frames of Stephen 
Harper’s 2008 apology for the Indian residential schools and its media coverage.  I will 
now explain how the apology and its media framing created a narrative of re-

 
59 
covenanting which followed Burke’s cycle of order, transgression, sacrifice and return to 
order.14   
4.1. Key Frames 
The following is an explanation of the key frames I found in my analysis of the 
apology and its media coverage.  My exposition of the data follows Burke’s cycle of 
Order, Transgression leading to Pollution, Sacrifice leading to Redemption and 
Restoration of the Order which create a narrative of re-covenanting.  I begin with a 
discussion of the revelation in the media that serious abuses had taken place within the 
residential schools.  As noted in my discussion of media events, in terms of cultural 
narrative, the Order is not broken until it is reported by the media (Kampf, 2011).  With 
Phil Fontaine’s revelation of his own abuse, the covenant had been broken and a 
sacrifice had to be made for it to be restored.  In the previous chapters I thoroughly 
discussed how, universally, the only sufficient sacrifice to restore order for a serious 
violation of the covenant is that of the head of the nation, the representative of the totem 
itself.  My analysis revealed that Canadians believed that this universal narrative must 
be followed, rejecting apologies which had been given by other government ministers.   
In this chapter I first expound upon the concept of the apology as symbolic 
sacrifice and note the universal archetypes such as the Denouncer and the Carnival 
King who appeared in the media framing of the apology.  I then discuss the processes 
by which the order is restored, including the granting of healing powers after the ritual of 
sacrifice and cleansing through catharsis.  Perhaps the most common frame that I found 
in both the apology itself and its media coverage was that of splitting the cleansed nation 
from the sinning nation, a process which allows the essence of the nation to, 
paradoxically, return to the Order before the Transgression, and be reborn, cleansed, 
with its values redefined in a new covenant.  I then discuss the evidence of the frames of 
rebirth, re-covenanting, and redemption, restoration of the order and national unity

60 
engendered by the media event of the apology.  Finally, in addition to the data which I 
saw in the content analysis of these media texts, I also discuss what I did not see in the 
text, most importantly, the granting of forgiveness. 
4.1.1. 
Revelation       
  In 1990, native leader Phil Fontaine revealed the extent of abuse that took place 
in the Indian residential schools to the stunned and previously ignorant Canadian public.  
In an interview with the iconic news anchor Barbara Frum, on the Canadian Broadcast 
Corporation prime time news show, The Journal, the native leader stated, ‘In my grade 
three class…if there were 20 boys, every single one of them…would have experienced 
what I experienced.  They would have experienced some aspect of sexual abuse" (Frum 
and Fontaine, 1990).  This interview marked the Transgression of the Order and the 
beginning of the cycle of re-covenanting. 
Fontaine had been a leader in the native community since the seventies and by 
the time of the interview he had risen to the head of the assembly of Manitoba chiefs.  
During the interview, he called for an investigation into the abuse at residential schools, 
but, although the government agreed that an investigation was in order, neither the 
church nor the government instigated an investigation.  However, in 1991, the 
government of Canada began a Royal Commission on Aboriginal peoples in which many 
aboriginals told their stories of abuse in the residential school system.  The report of this 
Royal Commission, published in 1996, recommended a separate public inquiry into the 
residential schools but this recommendation was never followed (“Did you Know?”, n.d.). 
4.1.2. 
The Search for an Adequate Sacrifice 
Despite ignoring the recommendation to conduct a public inquiry, in 1998, then-
Minister of Indian affairs Jane Stewart offered an apology for the abuses at the 
residential schools and set up a 350 million dollar healing fund with 250 million dollars in 
additional resources for the victims.  This apology stated: 
The government of Canada acknowledges the role it played in the 
development and administration of these schools.  Particularly to those 
individuals who experienced the tragedy of physical and sexual abuse at 

 
61 
residential schools, and who have carried this burden believing that in 
some way they must be responsible, we wish to emphasize that what you 
experienced was not your fault and should never have happened.  For 
those of you who suffered this tragedy, we are deeply sorry.                         
 
                                            (Stewart, cited in Anderssen, 1998) 
In The Globe and Mail, it was noted that this 1998 apology was “intended to mark 
a break from Ottawa's past attempts to assimilate aboriginal people” (Anderssen, 
January 7, 1998), a statement in line with the 2008 apology’s attempt to separate 
Canada into a past, sinning nation and a cleansed, present nation, a strategy which will 
be discussed in later in this chapter.  However, despite the fact this apology was 
commended by politicians and academics for its thoroughness in listing state abuses 
(ex. Gibney and Roxstrom, 2001, p. 930), it was not accepted because the apology did 
not come from the head of the state.  As discussed in the previous chapter, for serious 
sins, the scapegoat must be more than a mere minister.  Just as Christ, the embodiment 
of the church, had to die for redemption for the original sin of all Christians, for the 
original sin of the nation, colonization and subsequent child abuse, the god of the nation, 
the totem itself, embodied by its leader, must be sacrificed.  To achieve redemption for 
the original sin of the nation, the sacrificial King, the head of the settler state is the only 
acceptable victim. 
Yet, just having the correct victim is only a part of the many rules which must be 
followed for the ritual to be considered correct.  For the re-covenanting process to be 
successful, not only the sacrifice, but the space in which it takes place must be 
sufficiently holy and solemn.  Indo-Canadians were unhappy with the apology for the 
Komagata Maru incident because, though it was spoken by the sacrificial King -- 
Stephen Harper -- it took place in a mere park (“Indo-Canadians 'deceived'”, 2011).  Just 
as the Torah commands that sacrifices be made only in The Temple (Deuteronomy 
16:16)15, the sacrifice could only happen in the secular Temple of Canada: The House of 
Commons.  Windspeaker, Canada’s largest aboriginal newspaper, stated that survivors 
of the residential schools “have continually stressed the importance of hearing the prime 
minister say he’s sorry in Parliament [italic added]” (“Stephen Harper Will Issue”, 2008).  
 
15  Jews stopped the practice of animal sacrifice because of the destruction of this temple: there 
is no longer a place to sacrifice. 

 
62 
Just before the apology was about to occur, Phil Fontaine heard rumours that the prime 
minister would deliver the apology on May 21 or 23, during a parliamentary break, and 
thus not in the House of Commons.  In response to this rumour, Fontaine publicly stated 
that, “[t]he Prime Minister must rise in the house to present the apology to the country 
[italics added]” (“Fontaine Threatens to reject residential-school apology”, 2008).  Just as 
Burke informs us, the cycle of order, pollution, sacrifice and rebirth which lead to the re-
covenanting in the apology is an unending cycle.  The re-covenanting must be repeated 
until perfection is achieved (which will, by definition, never occur). On June 11th, 2008, 
after years of lead up, the prime minister of Canada, Stephen Harper, offered himself as 
this symbolic sacrifice in the House of Commons, in another attempt to re-covenant after 
the pollution generated by the transgression of the Indian Residential School system.  
4.1.3. 
 Symbolic sacrifice through humiliation: lowering to raise, 
killing to be born again 
In his ethnographic studies, Victor Turner (1969) identifies and discusses rituals 
of status reversal in which those of low status humiliate and degrade those in high 
status, giving examples such as the practice in some African societies of humiliating the 
future king immediately before he is throned (pp. 170 – 171).  Turner argues that, with 
such rituals "[t]he implication is that for an individual to go higher on the status ladder, he 
must go lower than the status ladder" (p.170).  We must keep in mind, as mentioned 
above, that in a Girardian twist, just as the scapegoat is made lower only to be deified in 
the end, the lowering of one’s status through apology can leads to an eventual elevation 
of one’s status.  As Lazare (2004) points out, the word humiliation comes from the Latin 
“humus” meaning soil or ground (Lazare, p. 45).  Through the process of apology, the 
offender is ritually humiliated, i.e. brought down in status.  When we violate social norms, 
we apologize in order to restore our own feelings of “dignity, self-respect, and honor (p. 
136): we lower ourselves in order to be raised in status in the eyes of the community.  
Like the prodigal son who is celebrated more than the son who remains, and the lost 
sheep that the Shepherd risks the rest of the flock to find, the one who sins is elevated 
beyond the level of those who have never sinned.  As Christ says in the gospel of Luke, 
“I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, 
than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance” (Luke, 15:7 King 

 
63 
James Bible).  Just as the sinner who repents finds himself more fêted than he/she who 
has not sinned, the one who is humiliated then confesses finds his/her status elevated 
beyond the pre-sinning state. 
In terms of the king as the totem leader, humiliation serves the function of 
symbolically killing the totem so that it can be born again purer and stronger.  The ritual 
of the national apology can most certainly be seen in this light.  The totem --embodied by 
its head -- is insulted by the public, members of the totem domains, and finally the totem 
leaders, for it to be reborn cleansed of previous sin, greater than it was before.  As Rene 
Girard (2001) notes, in myths from around the world, “the one who is lynched at the 
beginning of the myth… presides in the end over the reconstruction of this same system” 
(p. 65). In the ritual of the national apology, the leader and government are destroyed 
through humiliation, only to rule over the same system with reinvigorated legitimacy once 
the ritual is completed.   
Like all rituals of scapegoating, such rituals serve to strengthen the group in 
opposition to the scapegoat.  Founder of ethnomethodology, Harold Garfinkel (1956), 
calls the communicative work of lowering an individual’s identity through humiliation 
“status degradation ceremonies” (p. 420).  He argues that, with the exception of 
societies which have been completely demoralized, this ritual is universally found and 
explains that these ceremonies reinforce group solidarity and can be seen as “a secular 
form of communion” (p. 421).  He notes that: 
Through the process of humiliation, the collective becomes more united in 
its own sacredness in opposition to the sinning, profane character of the 
one being degraded. Just as, through opposition to the scapegoat, the 
identity of the community is redefined and solidified, the totem values of 
the nation are consolidated and solidified by the denunciation of those 
who pollute it. 
(Garfinkel, 1965, p. 421) 
The humiliation of the totem of Canada-past began years before Harper’s 2008 
apology, with accusations of sexual abuse at residential schools, admission of wrong 
doings from churches, documents such as the 1998 Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples, the 2006 class action deal, and the 2007 compensation package (“A Timeline”, 
2010) .  In the lead up to the apology, the media humiliated the prime minister by 
presenting Harper as being bullied by First Nations people, arguably the lowest status 

 
64 
people in Canada.  Headlines such as “Fontaine threatens to reject residential-school 
apology” (2008) insinuate that the head of the state could be threatened by the words of 
the leader of an affiliative domain.  A quick search of titles of the articles analyzed which 
were published before the apology show a variety of sources ‘demanding’ an apology 
from the prime minister (e.g. “Opposition  Demands apology for residential schools,” 
2008;  “Ex-students demand apology,” 2008; “First Nations Demand PM’s apology,” 
2008; “Native Leader Demands,” 2007, etc).  The prime minister is portrayed as being 
pushed around by other ministers, members of the opposition, and even ‘lowly’ First 
Nations people.  In an article from The Globe and Mail article from March 2007 titled 
“Opposition Demands Apology for Residential Schools,” (2007) the lack of apology to 
date is called an “insulting betrayal”.  In this article, the opposition “demands” to know 
why the prime minister “refuses to apologize for the atrocities suffered by these children” 
including the “unspeakable acts [which] were committed upon them”.  This reference to 
the sexual abuse can be seen as an attempt to embarrass the prime minister, 
associating Harper with the unapologetic sexual abuse of children. 
The culmination of the humiliation occurred on the day of the sacrifice itself, June 
11th, 2008.  The Globe and Mail reported that, on that day, leaders of the opposition 
“won applause with jabs at the Conservatives for refusing to endorse the United Nations 
Declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples” (Curry and Galloway, 2008).  Jack 
Layton went so far as to call the government policy on residential schools “racist”, a 
near-taboo word in Canada.  Phil Fontaine acknowledged the power of the humiliation 
by stating that “the telling of [the survivors'] painful stories [has] stripped white 
supremacy of its authority and legitimacy”; meanwhile, The Globe and Mail reported that 
Inuit leader Mary Simon stared defiantly at the prime minister, stating that her culture 
was still strong despite Canada’s attempts to kill it (Curry and Galloway, 2008). 
The Carnival King 
  A common variant of the status degradation ritual is the ritual of status reversal. 
We see such status reversals in our own times with rituals and festivals such as pre-
graduation “roasts” of faculty and administration by students, country fairs where sheriffs 
or mayors go in dunk-tanks, even holidays like Halloween where children ‘threaten’ 
adults for candy.  Turner (1969) argues that “rituals of status reversal make visible in 

 
65 
their symbolic and behavioral patterns social categories and forms of grouping that are 
considered to be axiomatic and unchanging both in essence and in relationship to one 
another...cognitively, nothing underlines regularity so well as absurdity” (p. 176).  A 
world-turned-upside-down for a short while serves to highlight the legitimacy of the usual 
social order.  Often, in status reversal rituals, “the status deprived use superiors’ 
language and manner against those same superiors” (Pharr, 1992).  We saw this is the 
formal speech and mannerisms of the indigenous leaders and residential school 
survivors who were admitted into the House of Commons to hear the apology.  
Moreover, Turner notes that during the liminal time of totem sacrifice before 
regeneration, a carnival king may be installed as the social order is turned over with 
slaves ruling over masters (p.57).  Of all the images that accompanied the media 
coverage of the apology, the most repeated and also most memorable is that of Phil 
Fontaine in his traditional chiefly attire, such as that shown in Figure.  As the head of the 
Assembly of First Nations, Phil Fontaine becomes the perfect carnival king in his 
elaborate crown, the ceremonial feathered headdress of his tribe: a mock-totem leader 
from the affiliative domain in the world-turned-upside-down.  
 
Figure 1: Chief Phil Fontaine and Prime Minister Stephen Harper, June 11, 2008. 
Note:  The image of Phil Fontaine speaking the house of parliament, wearing his ceremonial 
head-dress, was the most common image to accompany national and international 
coverage of the apology (Canadian Press Photo). 
 The media continually pointed out Fontaine’s important role in the apology 
process - highlighting his status.  In an article for MacLean’s, Nancy MacDonald (2008) 

 
66 
even argues that this “chapter” of our history would have remained “buried” had it not 
been for Fontaine, rightly stating that, at the time of the interview with Barbara Frum 
(Frum and Fontaine, 1990), very few people outside of the aboriginal community were 
aware of the extent of the abuse that had occurred in the residential schools.  
Saskatchewan historian J.R. Miller claims that Fontaine’s confession opened the 
“floodgates” on the issue, stating that when someone as prominent as Phil Fontaine 
spoke about his experience, others were encouraged to do the same (MacDonald, 
2008).  In the articles analyzed, no other person besides Harper was cited as often as 
Fontaine, affirming his role as king-for-a-day.  But as Turner (1969) notes of rituals of 
status reversal: "[n]ot only do they reaffirm the order of structure; they also restore 
relations between the actual historical individuals who occupy positions in that structure" 
(p.177).  In this manner, they restore communitas and structure (p.178), as, after the 
apology, Harper returned, stronger than ever, to his position as totem leader.   
 The Denouncer 
 
Garfinkel (1956) argues that it is critical that the denouncer at humiliation rituals 
be regarded as a public embodiment of the community, making its values salient (p. 
423).  Moreover, it is of critical importance to the success of the degradation ceremony 
that the denouncer must not be seen to be speaking in his own interests “that he may 
have acquired by virtue of the wrong done to him”; rather, he must speak according to 
the values of the community.  If the denunciation were only to come from the aboriginal 
community, the offended affiliative group, the ritual would have failed because these 
denouncers could have been seen as only acting in their own self-interest.  In addition, 
Garfinkel argues that “the denouncer must get himself so defined by the witnesses that 
they locate him as a supporter of these values”. As noted in the Introduction to this work, 
Harper (2008) acknowledged Layton’s critical role in the apology process in his 
preamble to the apology.  The press repeatedly reported that many people within and 
outside of the aboriginal community expressed their appreciation of then-NDP leader 
Jack Layton’s denunciation of the residential school system and Canada’s colonial past. 
The Aboriginal Peoples’ Television Network highlighted Jack Layton’s role in the apology 
process, quoting Stephen Harper as saying, “For the past year and a half, he [Layton] 
has spoken to me with regularity and great conviction on the need for this apology…  His 
advice, given across party lines and in confidence, has been persuasive and has been 

 
67 
greatly appreciated” (Barrera, 2011, May 1).  Though aboriginal people are not always 
portrayed in the media as upholders of enlightenment values of equality and human 
rights, Jack Layton, though he may have been accused of naive idealism, was always 
framed by both the media and other members of the totem domain in Canada as a 
defender of these core values, as was evident during the apology process and 
highlighted again in the media tributes to him upon his death and his state funeral.  
Thus, Layton was the perfect denouncer as the harm was not done directly to him, but 
rather, to the values that he represented.  
4.1.4. 
The Power to Heal 
Canadian journalist, novelist, playwright, and critic Rick Salutin’s (June, 13, 2008) 
article “Issues of Apology and Power”, published on the independent, alternative website 
rabble.ca, is the only article analyzed which discusses the power one gets from 
apologizing. He notes that “there was… a smug sense on the part of the apologizers… a 
cheer-leading air to Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl, like a coach before the big 
game: “It’s going to be a great apology.”  This cheerleading comes from the fact that the 
party members understood that the apology gives strength to the apologizers by granting 
them the power to “heal”.  Like the ancient myths where the hero offers himself as a 
sacrifice and then recovers to become a shaman (Dayan and Katz, 1992, p. 41, 44, 45), 
one of the key characteristics of figures who die for a cause, such as martyred saints 
and even Christ, is that they gain the ability to heal.  As Salutin holds a Master’s Degree 
in Religion from Columbia University, unlike other journalists writing on the issue, he is 
probably more aware of these narratives, and theories such as Burke and Girard’s 
scapegoat mechanism which gives healing power, even divinity, to the scapegoat. 
But, as Metis English professor Jo-Ann Episkenew boldly states: “Healing does 
not imply that Indigenous people are sick [...] Colonialism is sick... [a]lthough Indigenous 
people understand their need to heal from colonial trauma, most settlers deny that their 
society is built on a sick foundation and, therefore, deny that it requires a cure” (p. 11; 
cited in Henderson and Wakeham, 2009, p. 16).  While we cannot argue that the rhetoric 
of healing most often portrays natives as the ones who need to be healed with the 
settler-state being endowed with the power to heal, at least the re-covenanting narrative 

 
68 
recognized that something was wrong with the settler-state, which needed to be 
cleansed through sacrifice.   
4.1.5. 
Catharsis 
 As noted in the previous chapter, much of the apology process rests on the 
belief in words as medicine.  In Attitudes Towards History Burke discusses how words 
can have both homeopathic and allopathic functions (cited in Woods, 2009, p. 4).  
Allopathic medicine seeks to cause symptoms opposite of the symptoms of the disease 
such as reducing a fever by taking an aspirin. In contrast, homeopathic medicine seeks 
to treat by administering a small dose of something which causes similar symptoms of 
the disease. Whereas allopathic medicine would use humour in the face of tragedy, 
homeopathic medicine recognizes the healing power of the dirge or lament (cited in 
Woods, p. 4) or, in this case, apology accompanied by a list of abuses and harm done. 
One of the most important homeopathic medicines/rituals in this metaphor of 
words as cure is that of catharsis - which the Greeks saw as a medicinal purification.  In 
his essay on Shakespeare’s tragedy Othello, Burke writes that “a synonym for katharma 
was pharmakos: poisoner, sorcerer, magician; one who has been sacrificed or executed 
as an atonement or purification for others; a scapegoat. It is related to pharmakon: drug, 
remedy, medicine, enchanted potion, philtre, charm, spell, incantation, enchantment, 
poison” (1954, p. 153; quoted in Woods, 2009, p.3-4): the scapegoat and the medicine 
are inseparably intertwined in the notion of catharsis.  As opposed to more common 
Freudian recognitions of catharsis as a personal psychic cleansing, Aristotle saw 
catharsis as civic cleansing.  In the introduction to the Loeb Classical Library edition of 
The Poetics, the editor writes that, in Plato’s’ view of tragic purgation “[t]he soul, like the 
body, needs an occasional purge.  Pent-up emotion is apt to explode inconveniently.  
What the citizens need is an outlet such as dramatic poetry conveniently supplies” (Fyfe, 
1939, p. xiiii; quoted in Burke, 1959, p. 354).  In present times, political apologies can be 
seen as serving a similar function to these dramatic forms of catharsis which Aristotle 
believed helped keep social frustration at bay.  Those who are complaining about bad 
treatment can be appeased, at least temporarily, with the catharsis of the apology 
process.  

 
69 
 Burke (1959) writes that there is interchangeability in the terms for physiological 
and political purgation; political pollution might be referred to as a “plague” and the “cure” 
might be enacted through “the imitation of a divine person suffering superhuman 
tortures” (p. 339).  Burke explains that “when catharsis attains its full poetic statement… 
its terminology may also be expected to re-enact…bodily analogues” (p. 309).  We can 
see this in the many bodily references in the articles analyzed most notably the repeated 
references to tears and crying in media coverage of the event.  Le Devoir’s retelling of 
the ceremony highlights a residential school survivor “bursting into tears (a eclate en 
sanglot (translation mine)” (Castonguay, 2008).  The press repeated showed images of 
people crying, particularly of native women crying, such as that in Figure 2. Other 
articles, combined images of blood and tears with the emotion of the event and its 
cathartic healing power, such as the article from the Star Phoenix which stated, that Phil 
Fontaine, “lost his composure when he said ‘memories of residential schools sometimes 
cuts like merciless knives at our souls. This day will help us to put that pain behind us.’"  
Such statements highlight how catharsis can be seen as healing by enabling a group 
with grievances to move forward.     
 
Figure 2:  Native woman crying at apology ceremony 
Note:  One of the many images of the physical manifestations of catharsis displayed in the 
media (Mike Dembeck/Canadian Press). 
Perhaps nowhere was the cathartic nature of the ceremony more evident than on 
the front page of Canada’s largest national paper, The Globe and Mail, the day after the 
apology. The opening paragraphs generate, perhaps even exaggerate the cacophonous, 

 
70 
cathartic excitement of the event for the reader:  “Prime Minister Stephen Harper had yet 
to utter a single word of Canada’s apology to former Indian residential school students 
when the cheering began.  Native drumming and shouts turned to loud, simultaneous 
clapping.  Raw emotion bursting for an apology decades overdue” (Curry & Galloway, 
2008).  Other articles mentioned the tissue boxes which “were frequently reached for” 
(Atkinson, 2008).  Two years later, at the first national gathering of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission in Winnipeg in June 2010, the “Sacred Fire” was lit.  During 
subsequent events, “tissues of tears” have been collected at the end of the Hearings and 
are burned in the sacred fire (Truth and Reconciliation Commission, 2011) marking the 
end of the cathartic period. 
In his study, Aeschylus and Athens, classicist and Marxist philosopher George 
Thompson suggests that tragedy can symbolically resolve civic discord in a manner 
such that it is never actually transcended (cited in Burke, 1972, p. 14).  Based on my 
analysis of the media coverage of the event, there was much more symbolic resolution 
to the pain than talk of dealing with the legacy of the residential schools: very little 
mention was made of follow-up action compared to the many references which were 
made to the cathartic release of emotion.  A few of the articles even made skeptical 
references to the cathartic nature of the apology.  An editorial in The Vancouver Sun 
stated that, “while expressions of regret can be cleansing and cathartic, they can also 
become gratuitous and inspire cynicism in the broader community” (Yaffe, 2008).  As 
Roland Chrisjohn and Tanya Wasacase have argued, individual catharsis and validation 
of the survivor testimony is not “sufficient to draw the picture of the truth of Indian 
residential schooling” (quoted in Henderson and Wakeham, 2009. p. 14) and could be, in 
fact, an impediment to real justice.  The catharsis hides the fact that, like the Greek 
cycles of drama which were repeated every year, the apology is only part of an unending 
cycle of re-covenanting which has yet to address the systemic issue of colonialism.              
 
  
4.1.6. 
Splitting the Sinning Nation from the Cleansed Nation 
 As discussed in the previous chapter, pollution of the totem necessitates the 
main ritual of totem regeneration: the polluted totem must die in order to be reborn, 
cleansed. The process of totem regeneration strengthens both the unity of the 

 
71 
community and its identity. As Jeffrey C. Alexander (2003) notes in his Durkheimian 
analysis of the Watergate scandal, in order for a crisis to be considered worthy of the 
totem sacrifice necessary for the process of renewal, the event must be considered not 
only polluting, but to have polluted the very centre of the society: the totem itself.  
Certainly this is the case with the scandal of the residential schools. Though, as 
aboriginals, the students belonged to the affiliative domain, the teachers and overseers 
hailed from the totem domains of the church and government; hence, the pollution had 
entered the centre and infected the totem of Canada itself.  Once the pollution had 
infected the totem of Canada, it had to be ritually killed in order to be purified and 
regenerated. 
Yet how do we sacrifice the polluted totem without killing its seed, so necessary 
for regeneration? Just as Goffman (1971) argues that in everyday life we split ourselves 
into parts in order to reduce the responsibility that we must take for our actions and to 
gain audience sympathy, in some manner the polluted totem must be separated from the 
core community beliefs that it embodies in order for continuity to be maintained. As 
Ignatief eloquently noted that “simultaneity... is the dream-time of vengeance” (p. 186; 
quoted in Griswold, 2007, p. 192), and Arendt (1958) noted how forgiveness can save us 
from the “predicament of irreversibility” (p. 237) by cleansing the present of the past, 
Dayan and Katz argue that the transformative ceremony organizes time into two 
sections: pre and post ceremony (p.161).  The time before the ceremony is reified and 
killed as the ceremony marks a return to the society’s true identity before it was polluted 
(Alberoni; cited in Dayan and Katz, 1992).   
In his study of inter-state apologies, Shiping Tang (2011) notes that national 
myths often serve to divide abhorrent parts of a country’s history from its national 
essence.  He gives the example of the 20th century liberal Italian philosopher and 
politician Benedetto Croce’s attempt to propagate the myth that fascism was “a 
parenthesis in Italian history and an external virus that had penetrated its [Italy’s] healthy 
historical body”; the myth, instead, put forward the notion of “the biennio [the resistance 
of Nazi occupation from July 1943 to April 1945 in German-occupied northern Italy] as 
the true fact of Italian national identity”(Fogu; cited Lebow, Kansteiner, and Fogu; all 
cited in Tang, p. 735).  Along these lines, Australian sociologist and activist Danielle 
Celermajer (2009) argues that modern national apologies seek to separate the past 

 
72 
state of the nation, the sinning-nation, from its current state, its essence.  She illustrates 
this with examples from national apologies such as Chirac’s statement that the Vichy 
period was “an insult to our past and our traditions” (quoted on p. 21).  The new national 
identity is made stronger in its juxtaposition with the wrongdoing nation.  Just as, through 
myth the ancient Israelites sought to separate themselves from their idol-worshipping 
past and propagate their essence as a god-fearing nation, the apology helps define 
Canada-present as existing in accord with The Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in 
juxtaposition to its racist, discriminatory past.  There is a sense that in order for healing 
to occur, we must “put the events of the past behind us” (from the website of the TRC; 
cited in Henderson and Wakeham, 2009, p. 14).  Two separate totems have emerged 
from the formerly unified Canada: the polluted Canada-past, and the pure, regenerated 
Canada-present. 
We see this ideological separation between Canada-past and Canada-present in 
Stephen Harper’s 2008 apology with his repetitive use of time denoting words and 
phrases. 
Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has 
caused great harm, and has no place in our country…  
the government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian 
Residential Schools were profoundly negative…   
We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children…   
We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we 
undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children.   
We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse 
or neglect and were inadequately controlled [italics added]. 
 
 
(Harper, 2008,“Statements by Ministers,” para. 11 -26 ) 
Stephen Harper (2008) stresses this separation even more by stating that “There 
is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian Residential School system 
to ever again prevail.”  The totem of Canada-past cannot be allowed to live. 

 
73 
The language used in the coverage of the apology, of “moving forward” from a 
“sad chapter” not only echoes both Chirac’s statements but countless other leaders who 
attempt to separate their ideal nation from historically regrettable periods through 
segmentation, such as Bill Clinton’s 1998 description of slavery as “one of the most 
difficult chapters” in American history (quoted in Craemer, 2009, p. 278).  In fact, 
Harper’s reference to the residential school era as a “sad chapter” (Atkinson,2008; 
“Government of Canada Asks Forgiveness,” 2008; “PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter,” 2008; 
“Residential School Apology”, 2008) was the most quoted specific phrase in all of the 
articles analyzed. The record seems to be skipping with British Columbia Premier 
Gordon Campbell citing a “tragic chapter in our history [emphasis added]” (Atkinson).  
Other members of the totem domain such as then-opposition leader Stephane Dion 
joined the totem leader, Stephen Harper, in separating the Canada-past from Canada-
present by stating that the apology referred to “a past that should have been completely 
different” (“PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter”, 2008) while Jack Layton almost directly repeated 
Chirac’s reference to the Vichy period by calling the time of the residential schools “one 
of the most shameful eras of our history” (“PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter”).  Even members of 
the offended, affiliative domain joined in propagation of the division between the totems 
Canada-past and Canada-present, as Phil Fontaine referred to the era of the residential 
schools as a “dreadful chapter” in our past (“PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter”). 
Media commentators were also keen to use this phrase and thus disseminate the 
notion of the separation of the past, sinning nation from its present, essential state.  In 
his live coverage of the event, one of Canada’s most celebrated anchormen (and now 
Conservative senator), Mike Duffy (2008), described the residential school era as a 
“black part of Canadian past history” while the editorial the day after the apology in The 
Montreal Gazette referred to “a dark chapter” in our history (“Apology is the first step”, 
2008).  This theme is also evident in the references to past wrongs and historical 
injustices, particularly in terms such as “dark past” which highlight how different a time 
and place it was then, than Canada is now (“Residential School Apology Resonates,” 
2008). 
Similarly, many media commentators on the apology noted that attitudes now are 
different than they were in the past, during the “sad chapter.”  After explaining how 
Trudeau’s government did not even entertain the idea of an apology when issuing the 

 
74 
red paper, Duffy simply states, “[h]ow things have changed.”  We can also see this in 
repeated references to past wrongs and injustices such as the Angus Reid Poll which 
asked Canadians if they thought the government should apologize for “past unjust 
treatment” of native people (Harper will issue long-awaited apology, June, 2008), as 
though there is nothing wrong with how they are being treated now. 
Similar turns of phrase were repeated in the French language press as Le Devoir 
referred to “une page somber de l’histoire canadienne” and “turn[ing] a dark page” (my 
translation) in our history (Castonguay, 2008).  Le Devoir quoted Stephane Dion as 
saying that, with the apology, we came face to face with “one of the darkest chapters” 
[my translation] in our history (Castonguay).  In his Interim Report for the TRC, even 
Justice Murray Sinclair, a member of the affiliative domain himself, refers to the “une 
triste episode” (Pensionnats autochtones - Après les abus, la redemption, 2012).  They 
fail to mention that, time-wise, this “chapter” encompassed almost 90% of Canada’s 
history as a nation.  Moreover, it is a disavowal of the fact that Canada, past and 
present, may simply be a racist society; instead, such statements support the narrative 
that it is only this era of our history, and not Canada as a whole which needs to be the 
scapegoat ready for sacrifice.  Only the past, sinning nation need be killed, leaving what 
is newly defined as the essence, for regeneration.  The totem of Canada can be 
resurrected from the seed, now purified of its sinning “chapter”. 
Despite some of their leaders such as Phil Fontaine and Murray Sinclair using 
this language, not all natives were happy with the rhetoric of a “sad chapter”, and the 
media recognized this.  An article from The Globe and Mail article quotes Grand Chief 
Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs as saying, “I’m a little 
disappointed[Mr. Harper] called it a ‘sad chapter’ because it doesn’t really show the 
depth of the tragedy for so many of our people” (Atkinson, June, 12, 2008).  Not 
everyone agreed with the framing of the residential school era as belonging to a past, 
sinning nation and not the essence of Canada. 
In a similar, yet more cynical take on apologies, Erving Goffman (1972) states 
that, “apologies represent a splitting of the self into a blameworthy part and a part that… 
dissociates itself from the delict and affirms a belief in the offended rule” (pp. 113-114; 
cited in Smith, 2008, p. 63). In a collective rather than an individual sense, this is the 

 
75 
objective of the political apology.  But, rather than just dividing a nation into a sinning 
past and a cleansed present, the history of the nation is divided into a past sinful chapter 
and a national essence which encompasses the idealized past, the present and the 
future. This essence of the nation is made clearer in juxtaposition with the offense and 
the harm it has caused to society.  One of the most frequently used elements in all of the 
articles analyzed, was the word abuse.  After discussions of the abuse, Stephen 
Harper’s sentiments that, “There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the 
Indian Residential School system to ever again prevail” and that this “policy of 
assimilation… has no place in our country [emphasis added]” (e.g. “A Long-Awaited 
Apology”, 2008; “Canada’s Expression of Sorrow”, 2008; Fiddler, 2008; “Government of 
Canada asks for Forgiveness,” 2008, “PM cites ‘sad chapter,” 2008) reinforce the 
contrast of the essential humane nation, with the abusive nation.     
 
One striking difference between the aboriginal and alternative presses and the 
more mainstream was the complete absence of the notion that the residential schools 
were part of the framework of colonialism. This fits in well with the frame presented by 
the government and the mainstream press that the residential schools were a “sad 
chapter” and not part of a larger narrative. As Henderson and Wakeham (2009) note, 
“[t]he absence of the word ‘colonialism from the prime minister’s apology enables a 
strategic isolation and containment of residential schools as a discrete historical problem 
of educational malpractice rather than one devastating prong of an overarching and 
multifaceted system of colonial oppression that persists in the present” (p.2).  Some 
have pointed out that the real risk in separating the nation in this manner is that it fails 
justice.  As Henderson and Wakeham note, if the populace believes “the state’s strategic 
formulations of it [the residential school system] as an isolated error in educational 
policy” then we will never be able to “reject a naive progressivist model of history that 
‘views this past and its violence as, in fact, past, and so, no longer pertinent to a present 
practice of justice’ (Baucom, p. 305)” p. 14).  The re-covenanting process is seen to wipe 
to slate clean even though the realities of ongoing colonialism have not been 
acknowledged.

4.1.7. 
Rebirth 
To this point, my analysis of Stephen Harper’s apology and its media framing has 
discussed the point at which the Transgression entered the popular conscious (via the 
media) and the process of the Sacrifice of the totem leader via humiliation through public 
apology.  This has revealed the first stages of the cycle of re-covenanting in that there 
was an established order which was violated and a sacrifice occurred to cleanse the 
nation of that violation.  This next section deals with the final phase of the cycle: the 
restoration of the order via the redefinition and rededication of the covenant. 
“A New Dawn” 
Hannah Arendt boldly claimed that because of the plurality of human existence, 
our actions inescapably become part of the complex network of others’ actions and thus 
their consequences become unknowable (Young- Bruehl, 2009, p. 52).  Arendt (1958), 
notes that whenever we act, we are at risk of becoming “guilty” of consequences of our 
action which we “never intended or even foresaw” (p. 223); yet, through the possibility of 
apology, we are able to mitigate this frightening prospect via the “possible redemption 
from the predicament of irreversibility” (p.237). Apology and forgiveness allow us to 
symbolically undo the past.  Eliade eloquently states that in confession and 
regeneration, “[man] recovers the possibility of definitively transcending time and living in 
eternity. Insofar as he fails to does so, insofar as he “sins”, that is, falls into historical 
existence, into time” (1965, p. 157).  Just as Arendt (1952) saw that apology and 
forgiveness hold the possibility of undoing the past, Eliade saw that thanks to confession 
and regeneration, humanity can retain “the freedom to annul [its] faults, to wipe out the 
memory of [its] ’fall into history’ and to make another attempt to escape definitively from 
time” (p. 158).  The press recognized this amazing ability of the apology; an article from 
the Toronto Star from the day after the apology explicitly stating that, “the backward 
approach to moving forward is inseparable from Ottawa’s day of atonement” (Travers, 
June 12, 2008) -- time travel to achieve at-one-ment of the nation.  
Because, as Arendt (1958) argues, forgiveness is the only action which occurs 
without the provocation of the past, in what Arendt refers to as a “world-rupturing” or 
“delimiting” moment, forgiveness brings the processes of interaction caused by the initial 
wrongs to an end and facilitates the possibility of new beginnings. In the articles 

 
77 
analyzed, the apology for the residential schools was repeatedly referred to as a 
“historic” event (“A Long-Awaited Apology,” 2008; “Canada’s Expression of Sorrow,” 
2008; Fiddler, 2008; “PM cited ‘sad chapter,” 2008), which could facilitate a “new dawn” 
– (“Fiddler;” “Canada’s Expression of Sorrow”) or “fresh start (my translation)” (“Phil 
Fontaine Veut Une Discussion Nationale,” 2008).  On this point Dayan and Katz’s (1992) 
theory of media events corresponds with Arendt’s theory of forgiveness: as alluded to in 
the discussion of the liminal nature of the media event, discussed in the last chapter, the 
media event, like the apology, is the world-rupturing moment that allows us a glimpse of 
an ideal future, from what is to what should be intimated in Stephane Dion’s statement 
that the residential schools were part of “a past that should have been completely 
different” (“PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter,” 2008).      
 
Re-covenanting 
In the rituals of totem regeneration, “natalism comes after sacrifice” (Marvin, 
1994, p. 277): “the alienating of iniquities from the self to the scapegoat amounts to a 
rebirth of the self” (Burke, 1962, p. 407). In the last third of his apology, the prime 
minister moves on to the theme of regeneration and rebirth.  He states that the Indian 
Residential Schools Settlement Agreement “gives us a new beginning and an 
opportunity to move forward together in partnership… forging a new relationship 
between aboriginal peoples and other Canadians” (PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter’, June 11th, 
2008).  
Celermajer (2009) argues that the recent political apologies are “an 
acknowledgement of a collective failure to live up to an ideal ethical principle and… a 
new covenant for now and into the future” (p. 247).  Just as Israel promised to maintain 
its new image of itself as a god-fearing nation as juxtaposed to its idol-worshipping past, 
Canada now defines its essence as a follower of human rights, embodied in The Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, in juxtaposition to its discriminatory, racist past.  Though, 
through the act of re-covenanting, the apology is said to “bring the historical community 
back into alignment with the ideal community” (Celermajer, p. 35), it is not simply a 
return to the past, but a rebirth.  As Celermajer notes, even for the Ancient Israelites, 
covenanting was seen as a new beginning and not just a return.  She argues that this is 
evident in the fact that the word for covenanting, teshuvah, is almost always used in its 

 
78 
verbal form, indicating that it was seen as a process, and thus, not a return to the past 
but the turning to a “yet-to-be fulfilled principle” (p. 35).  For the ancient Israelites, as for 
Canadians, the regenerated totem is like a phoenix rising from the fire, in that it is a new 
being, separate from the totem-past of the sinning nation. 
Though I see the whole process of the apology and its media coverage as 
constituting a re-covenanting, I feel the need to point out that some of the articles even 
made direct references to what can only be seen as a covenant with references to 
“redefining the relationship between First Nations and government” (“à redéfinir les 
relations entre les Premières Nations et le gouvernement” (my translation) (Phil Fontaine 
veut une discussion nationale, 2008); as with some of the other archetypal themes 
discussed in this thesis, the indigenous Canadians cited by the media seemed to be 
more cognizant of these underlying religious themes than non-aboriginals. On CTV’s 
coverage of the event, residential school survivor Andrea Curly states that she is 
thinking of the apology in terms of “treaty belts, wampum belts… the silver covenant 
chain… things we need to go back to look at the relationship that was to be put there in 
the first place.  Those are the kinds of things we need to look at if we want to go forward” 
(on Duffy, 2008).  We must remember that the common notion of religion as something 
separate from everyday life impedes recognition of the underlying religious narratives at 
work in political rhetoric and perhaps, allows those with a different weltanschauung, such 
as aboriginals, to more easily see below the surface. 
Redemption: rebirth of the scapegoat 
Six months after the apology, in his article titled, “Residential schools apology 
deeply moved Harper, changed his views” (Jan, 6, 2009), The Globe and Mail 
Parliamentary Reporter Bill Curry discusses the transformation of Stephen Harper during 
the apology process.  
The day after the June 11 apology, Michael Wernick, the deputy minister 
of Indian Affairs, confided to one of his colleagues that the event 
appeared to have changed the Prime Minister.  ‘I certainly get the 
impression the PM has had a personal transformation and this may have 
a 
substantial 
impact 
on 
his 
worldview,’ 
Mr. 
Wernick 
wrote.    
  
 
(Curry, 2009) 

 
79 
Curry (2009) quotes another Conservative official as stating that, in learning 
about the residential schools, Harper, “went through an evolution in his own thinking,” 
and then goes on to discuss just how Harper had changed.  He quotes Harper’s former 
chief of staff and campaign  manager, Professor Tom Flanagan, who reminds us that in 
1996, as a Reform MP, Harper had argued against granting a posthumous pardon to 
Louis Riel and that in 2000 Harper praised Flanagan’s book “First Nations: Second 
Thoughts” which questions native rights and “infuriated native leaders.” 
An article in The Globe and Mail two days after the apology (Curry and Laghi, 
June 13, 2008) states that is was “pleas” from two cabinet ministers, a Metis senator, 
and Jack Layton that led Harper to make the apology. Like the article from Jan. 2008, 
this article repeatedly uses the word “moved” to describe why Harper made the apology 
-- suggesting a change in his emotions, if not his character.  The article states that 
Harper’s decision to make the apology was prompted by “a moving and private letter” 
from Phil Fontaine which “touched a chord” with Harper.  Conservative Senator Gerry St. 
Germain is quoted as stating that, “[t[his brought out the compassionate side of the 
man.” 
Paralleling the fact that, just before the apology, the titles of articles contributed 
to the humiliation of the Stephen Harper as victim, after the apology, the titles of articles 
raised the status of the Prime Minister from victim to saviour.  The first article in the 
Canadian Jewish News after the apology, regarding the event was titled, simply, 
“Apology Praised” (2008). The allusion, consciously or unconsciously, of the title that 
Harper has been deified through the apology process and is now worthy of worship, is 
noteworthy from a paper which posts Shabbat times on its front page 
4.1.8. 
Uniting the nation through the media event   
 As Benedict Anderson (1991) states, “the members of even the smallest nation 
will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in 
the minds of each lives the image of their communion" (p. 6).  Yet, by addressing a mass 
audience the media are able to create and strengthen the “imagined community” with 
events such as the Olympics (Anderson) or, as I argue, the political apology, which 
offers a narrative that resonates with the deep cultural myth of all its citizens.  Moreover, 

 
80 
as discussed in the last chapter, the scapegoat mechanism is a powerful bonding 
exercise: along with the communitas experienced in the ritual itself, the nation finds a 
common identity in opposition to the scapegoat and the sins it carries (i.e. the sins of the 
nation-past), and a common purpose in not allowing these sins to re-emerge but, instead 
to strengthen the power of the cleansed totem.  
From the first rumours of its happening, Canada’s First Nations made it clear that 
in order for the apology to be valid, it must be a media event which reached across the 
country. A few months before the apology was to occur,  Postmedia News announced 
that Grand Chief Phil Fontaine would accept “nothing short of a significant public event” 
(“Fontaine Threatens to reject residential-schools apology,” 2008).  Just as British 
reporters were so keen to describe the celebrations of the recent Royal Wedding and 
American media showed pictures of Japanese fans crying over Michael Jackson’s death 
Canadian journalists recognized the apology as a media event which occurred not just in 
the House of Commons but in the houses of all the commoners.  But whereas news 
coverage of international media events such as the Royal Wedding or Jackson’s death 
stress global participation in the event, coverage of this apology reflected and enhanced 
feelings of national unity giving a national perspective as newspapers across the country 
announced the time, date and schedule of events for the live program and reporting on 
viewing of the apology from all over the country. 
In his address to the House of Commons following the apology, Jack Layton 
(2008), recognizing the importance of the media event which had just occurred, 
acknowledged both those in the chamber itself as well as those “participating in this 
ceremony the length and breadth of this land at this very moment… watching at home in 
gatherings across the land.” The Globe and Mail, published in Toronto, chose to reflect 
the national character of the apology with details of the ceremony being watched at the 
other end of the country:  
as more than 1,000 Lower Mainland natives and their leaders squeezed 
into The Chief Joe Mathias Centre in North Vancouver to hear Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper’s apology… Elders and their grandchildren sat 
side by side inside the auditorium, while others stood, all listening as Mr. 
Harper read his official statement in a broadcast shown on two large 
screens.  
(“A Memory Worth Cherishing,” 2008)   

 
81 
Then-Indian-affairs minister Chuck Strahl is cited as encouraging aboriginal 
groups to hold events “to hear it together” on televisions or computers and is quoted as 
saying that he expected such events at “between 35 and 40 friendship centres and other 
assembly points across the country” (“PM to Apologize”, 2008).  Although the event 
occurred in the high house of the leaders of the totem domain in the small city of Ottawa, 
so far from Vancouver, Nunavit and New Brunswick, the media event itself emphasized 
that common people, even members of the affiliative domain, participated in the event 
via the media itself. 
One of the most common themes in all the Canadian articles analyzed was that 
of reconciliation and improved relationships between peoples within Canada (“Canada’s 
Expression of Sorrow,” 2008; Curry & Galloway, 2008; Fiddler, 2008; “Government of 
Canada Asks Forgiveness,” 2008; “PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter,” 2008).  Just as Dayan and 
Katz maintain that “collective viewing reinforces a shared perspective on reality” (p. 177, 
quoted in Scannel, 1995, p. 15), the corporately-owned newspaper, The Globe and Mail, 
repeatedly mentioned how shared viewing of the event on large television screens in 
major cities brought aboriginals and non-aboriginals together (“PM Cites ‘Sad Chapter,” 
2008).  What is implied is that participants in rituals become “more committed to shared 
beliefs and institutions of their respective communities after such participation than they 
were before” (Etzioni, 2000, p. 47). 
 Some politicians even explicitly referred to the power of this event to unite the 
country.  Michael Ignatieff, who both headed Harvard’s Carr Centre for Human Rights 
and, in 1996 spent six months in South Africa making a documentary on that country’s 
Truth and Reconciliation process, stated that the apology is “not about making 
Canadians feel guilty, it’s about making Canadians feel responsible – saying ‘Yeah, this 
happened. And let’s unite as a country and make sure it doesn’t happen again” (italics 
added, MacDonald, 2008).  While perhaps not so explicit, the media encouraged the 
notion that this was a unified and unifying event with phrases such as the opening lines 
of the article on the apology from the Kamloops Daily News which stated that “there was 
a strong national consensus” on what the apology needed to be (“Harper got it right on 
apology,” 2008). 

 
82 
There was also much discussion in the articles of the importance of the apology 
for building healthier native communities, which would contribute to a more united 
Canada. For example, Phil Fontaine was quoted as saying that the apology process, the 
subsequent TRC and funding for native educational and social programs, will lead to 
“[t]he formation of families and strong communities and a vigorous culture that will 
contribute to the strength of Canada” (“Phil Fontaine veut,” 2008).  The Toronto Star 
noted that the Prime Minister holds up the apology as “a prime example of Canadian 
togetherness” and chose to title its Canada Day article on the topic “Native Apology sign 
of unity for Canada, Harper says” (2008).  Indeed, notions of reconciliation and a new 
relationship between aboriginals and other Canadians was a key theme in almost all the 
articles analyzed. 
Several of the articles also mentioned the importance of the apology process in 
putting the story of the residential schools on the public record and educating Canadians 
about the process.  Many of the articles analyzed had comments from average citizens 
stating things like, "it's hitting me today that I know more about black slavery in the U.S. 
than I do about my own neighbour's abuse in my own country" (“Residential School 
Apology Resonates,” 2008).  The media coverage of the apology pointed out Canadians’ 
ignorance about their own country, and at the same time encouraged education 
regarding our history with statements that the apology “was an opportunity for the entire 
country to learn about this dark chapter in our history” (“Apology is the First Step”,  
2008).  As mentioned earlier, the Interim Report of the Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission of Canada (2012) mentioned that the text of the apology should be on 
display in every secondary school classroom in the country.  As Benedict Anderson 
(1991) notes, in the contemporary nation, we no longer know each other through 
marriage or direct economic transaction, instead it is through our shared stories that we 
come to feel that we have something in common and conceptualize ourselves as a 
nation. Educational campaigns surrounding the apology and the media coverage itself 
helps to create national stories which serve to unite and create a coherent national 
identity. 
Not surprisingly, in contrast to the mainstream coverage of the event, some 
aboriginal and French language articles had a different take on the national unity angle 
to the apology.  Whereas the non-aboriginal press continually noted that the media event 

 
83 
brought aboriginal peoples from across the country together, much of the coverage in 
the aboriginal press stressed that the event brought white politicians together.  An article 
on the Aboriginal People’s Television Network website titled, “Residential school apology 
rare ‘consensus’ moment during centralized, secretive Harper minority rule: U.S. 
diplomatic cable,” noted that “up to the point of writing, the only times Harper reached 
out across partisan lines came when he delivered the apology to residential school 
survivors and secured an extension to the Afghanistan mission” (Barrera, 2011).  Only in 
war and apology were the politicians able to unite; only in opposition to an ‘other’, either 
another nation or our own past.  The author goes on to point out Harper’s praise of NDP 
leader Jack Layton both before and during the apology itself: white politicians 
congratulating one another on apologizing for the acts of past white administrations.  
Little mention is made of aboriginals and other Canadians acting in consort.  Perhaps 
unsurprisingly the independent French language paper, Le Devoir, did not stress that the 
media event fostered national unity.  Instead, their cover story on the issue states that 
about 500 people gathered on the parliament lawns to watch the apology on giant 
screens (Castonguay, 2008).  Whereas The Globe and Mail noted ceremonies from 
across the country, Le Devoir focused on the events as occurring in Ottawa and did not 
directly mention any Quebec residential schools.  The media analysis revealed that the 
mainstream media were eager to show the apology as a truly national media event, 
though not directly stating that the aim of the apology was national unity building, this 
notion was not stressed, though not utterly rejected, in the aboriginal and French 
language press. 
4.2. Missing Frames: What’s Not There 
4.2.1. 
The Totem Secret 
If government apologies are really meant to regenerate national totems and 
foster unity through re-covenanting rather than simply seek forgiveness, then why do we 
not hear the apology discussed in this context more often?  In his discussion of tribunals 
following mass atrocities, law professor Mark Osiel states that such trials can serve as 
“secular rituals of commemoration” which help to consolidate national memory but that 
this collective memory can only be entrenched in a national psyche if the real purpose of 

 
84 
the trials is kept secret.  In order for the ritual to work, the secular public must believe 
that they are for the purpose of justice alone (quoted in Minow, 1998, p. 46) rather than 
believing that there is a conspiracy of the elite totem domain to keep the real purpose of 
the government apology secret. Just as Althusser (2008, p. 49) informs us that “ideology 
never says, 'I am ideological'”, secular rituals do not reveal themselves as such.  
Marvin and Ingle (1999) argue that we only place on “primitive’ cultures the 
inability to distinguish between their religion and culture, yet, a feature of modernity is 
projecting our own deep impulses onto other cultures” (p.3).  They go on to argue that 
the more textually based a society is, the more likely it is to fail to recognize its own ritual 
capacity (p. 4).  We see our own such rituals of totem regeneration as secular 
ceremonies, ignoring their religious undercurrent.  Marvin (1994) notes that, during 
elections, members of the totem domains such as the established press and politicians 
themselves are constantly asking for more substantive discussion of the issues and that 
this insistence keeps us away from the real themes of “sacrifice, creation and renewal” 
(p. 269). The American public ate up Obama’s ritually regenerative themes of hope and 
change yet gate-keepers of the totem such as veteran politicians and political 
commentators (e.g. Pickler, March 27, 2007) demanded more discussion of issues and 
less “totem talk” as Marvin refers to these themes.  We see a similar pattern in the 
Canadian media coverage of the apology: the mainstream press tended to stick to talk of 
new relationships and closure while articles from alternative sources such as rabble.ca -- 
a website that obviously appeals to the educated reader -- demanded action. 
As noted earlier in the case of Harper’s apology for the residential schools, the 
receivers of the apology cited in the media seemed more conscious of the religious 
narratives than the apologizers themselves.  Perhaps aboriginals, because of their 
cultural background’s lack of stress on separation between religious and political 
governance, understood the apology as a religious ritual better than non-aboriginal 
Canadians.  After his apology for Bureau of Indian affairs practices towards Native 
Americans, the native American head of the Bureau stated that the apology, was 
“spiritual”, a term that certainly was not applied by the non-aboriginal observers.  As 
earlier noted in Phil Fontaine’s pronouncement that aboriginal stories had stripped the 
power away from hegemonic racism, many aboriginal leaders and survivors seemed to 
understand that the magic of words had taken away the power of the powerful. 

 
85 
Aboriginals spoke in mystical terms of the healing which came from the apology.  
Indeed, Phil Fontaine also stated that the event “testifies to nothing less than the 
accomplishment of the impossible” (“PM Cites Sad Chapter,” 2008).  Fontaine 
recognized the religiosity of the ritual in its miraculous character. Even before the 
apology had happened, Phil Fontaine was the only politician to recognize that the 
apology was more than a political necessity, stating that it was a “moral obligation” for 
the Prime Minister to apologize (“Fontaine Demands”, 25 April, 2007). 
But the most obviously missing frame, the one thing that gives away the secret 
that this ritual was more than simply a promise not to repeat an action, is the fact that 
achieving forgiveness seemed utterly unimportant to the members of totem domain 
including the government and the mainstream media. Psychiatrists such as Lazare 
(2004) argue that the apology process heals by giving the offended party the power to 
forgive or not forgive (p. 50, 52) yet do not point out that often in collective apologies, 
forgiveness is not the goal and therefore, the transfer of power does not happen. 
Celemajer (2009) notes that most political apologies are not structured in a manner 
which even allows for immediate forgiveness by the victim.  Rather, victim groups can 
respond after the ritual is completed, therefore not interfering with the success of the 
ritual (Celemajer, pp. 59-60).  Celemajer's argument shows that the government apology 
does not fit the secular, economic model of forgiveness: the wrongdoer is not looking for 
an exchange of an apology for forgiveness, or even addressing the victims.  
In his work, The Apology Ritual, philosopher Christopher Bennet (2008) states 
that, “a ritual… is an act the form of which expresses the attitude that a participant ought 
to have in performing it, (think of kneeling in order to pray)” (p.9).  As we see, the 
possibility of insincerity is built into the very definition of ritual.  Ritual is designed to 
foster a desired attitude, but just because this attitude is not actually fostered in all the 
participants, all of the time, does not mean that the ritual has been unsuccessful.  As 
Marvin (1994) states, “ritual is a group process constructed to work not only with, but in 
spite of individual acts, including those of the totem leaders.”  As long as the participants 
do not outright refuse to participate in the ritual, it must be granted that they, at some 
level, accept it.  Moreover, as I mentioned in my initial definition of the term apology, I 
see the fundamental difference between private and public apologies in the importance 
of sincerity versus posterity.  As the purpose of the apology is re-covenanting, then the 

 
86 
actual acceptance of the apology by the victims is a very small part of all that the 
apology is meant to accomplish. 
Some of the articles I analyzed noted that the natives were not to respond to the 
apology in the House of Commons (O’Neill, 10 June 2008) but this was permitted after 
some negotiation.  Despite this negotiation, some articles still made it clear that natives 
had no place in the sacred temple of our secular religion.  Le Devoir states that dozens 
of First Nations people “invaded” (“envahi”) the House of Commons.  More than the 
other papers, Le Devoir seemed to stress this, stating that some survivors were “had the 
privilege (on eu le privilege (my translation)” to have a seat in the house of commons 
(Castonguay, 2008). Such wording articulates the fact that the commissive act of the 
apology is committing to a new identity directed at its own group members (Celemajer, 
2009, p. 60 - 63), those of the totem and popular domains; the victim group is only part 
of the ritual in its position as a necessary part of the redemptive narrative.  As Roy 
Rappaport (cited in Mihelj, 2008) argues, for rituals to be successful, all the participants 
do not have to necessarily believe in its fundamental tenets, rather, their participation is 
enough.  If this were a personal apology, then one could hardly say it was successful if 
forgiveness was not achieved, but this is not the goal of such a public ritual.  The 
residential school survivors do not need, for example, an official statement of 
forgiveness, in order for the ritual to have been successful.  The very visual participation 
of native leaders wearing head-dresses and holding drums is adequate to denote their 
respect for the ritual.  The totem is sacrificed and regenerated regardless of the 
achievement of forgiveness. 
Themes of forgiveness and acceptance of the apology, or even any response 
from a native, were rarely even mentioned in the articles from the public and corporate 
media whereas this was one of the more frequently recurring topics in the articles from 
the aboriginal news source, Windspeaker.  Articles in Winderspeaker frequently noted 
that healing would resonate from the apology – an allusion to the mystical power of a 
ritual to affect real-life situations, whereas, in the non-aboriginal press, the issue of 
whether or not the apology was accepted was unimportant as the magic of the re-
covenanting through scapegoating and totem regeneration is not dependent on the 
affiliative domain’s acceptance of the apology. 

 
87 
As mentioned earlier, there was also a stunning lack of discussion of the 
residential schools within the context of colonialism.  Such framing serves to hide the 
fact that the apology is part of the cycle of sacrifice and rebirth.  Seeing the residential 
schools as a “sad chapter” removes these events from history and effaces the grander 
project of systemic oppression which has yet to be eliminated.   
4.3. The Narrative 
The culmination of these frames of revelation, sacrifice, humiliation, catharsis, 
splitting the nation, rebirth and unification follow Burke’s (1962) cycle of the rejection of 
the order, sacrifice, redemption, and return to the order.  The result of the frames found 
in the apology itself and its media coverage is a consistent narrative of totem 
regeneration via scapegoating in line with religions from around the world.  Through the 
process of totem regeneration via the apology for the Indian residential school system, 
the totem of Canada, the “redolent symbol… connoting multifold moral meaning” 
(Alexander, 2003, p.160) was reborn and reinvigorated.  The Residential school system 
had polluted the totem and all things associated with it had been placed on the negative 
side of the polarized symbolic classification system of the nation.  With the humiliation of 
full admission of guilt and apology, the totem leader was able to sacrifice the polluted 
Canada-past and allow the Canada-present to emerge and to be associated with the 
new totem truths of peace, equality and human rights as stated in The Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms and complete the process of re-covenanting.

5. 
Conclusion 
My analysis of the apology and its media coverage revealed several key frames 
which help to establish and convey the narrative of re-covenanting.  After the rejection of 
the order was revealed and the correct time and place for the sacrifice was established, 
Stephen Harper endured a ritual of status reversal and humiliation which served as a 
symbolic sacrifice.  His apology delineated a difference between a sinning Canada-past 
and an essential Canada-present, allowing members of the totem domain to sacrifice the 
totem of Canada-past and a newly defined essence of the nation to be born. By setting 
himself up as a surrogate for the totem itself, Harper endured a ritual of humiliation 
culminating in the media event of the apology which contributes to a new covenant 
based on equality and human rights.  The media played on the cathartic nature of the 
ritual as well as its national character.  In both the apology itself and its media coverage, 
the humiliation was immediately followed by talk of rebirth and re-covenanting and the 
totem was regenerated into the pure Canada-present.  Through the death of the sinning 
nation, the totem was able to re-emerge, cleansed, with the reinvigorated essential 
national identity of peace, equality and human rights encapsulated in The Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms (1982). 
5.1. Reasons for Pessimism 
As political scientists Gibney and Roxstrom (2001) note, the majority of state 
apologies are quite devoid of historical context.  In discussing Prime Minister Blair’s 
apology for the Irish Potato famine, there was no attempt to situate the event within the 
context of British colonial rule.  Similar to my own observations that the apology sought 
to separate the residential schools from the essential character of the nation, Blair’s 
apology emphatically portrayed the potato famine as an isolated incident within an 
otherwise glorious national past and that the “the raw racism that was behind the British 
policy during the potato famine was also a thing of the past” (p. 933).  Beyond what I 

 
89 
have noted as the importance of historical context, Gibney and Roxstrom argue that 
apologies must also be put in their moral and psychological context; in the case of the 
apology for the Irish potato famine, there must be some attempt to explain the “mind-set 
behind colonial rule itself... and some effort to relate this to events of the present.”  They 
rightly note that “this will not be achieved by pretending that wrongs were aberrations, 
nor by pretending that similar wrongs are not taking place in the present” (p. 933).   
Gibney and Roxstom (2001) argue that if apologizers do not ask themselves why 
the action was committed, they are liable to commit the same mistakes again (p. 934).  
And, to some, this is exactly what has happened in post-apology Canada.  Henderson 
and Wakeham (2009) note that documents such as Discover Canada (the new 
citizenship guide, released in 2009) originally contained references to the abuse of 
aboriginal children in residential schools, but that these references were excised from 
the final document (p. 3), perhaps an indication that the apology will not become a part 
of our national narrative as some had hoped.  Seemingly contradictorily, this citizenship 
guide does include references to the internment of both Ukrainian and Japanese 
Canadians.  Henderson and Wakeham argue that this encourages new Canadians to 
see the settler-state of Canada as “a nation which has bravely faced up to its historical 
errors” (p.3); meanwhile, the March 2010 federal budget did not renew funding to the 
Aboriginal Healing Foundations which was established to finance healing-programs for 
residential-school survivors and their families (p. 16). 
Sadly, we must remember that in Burke’s cycle of order, pollution, sacrifice and 
redemption, there is no historical progress.  The tragedies of ancient Greece had to be 
performed in annual cycles in which guilt was “processed” but not “resolved” (Burke, 
1970, p.236) and the Old Testament is essentially a story in which the cycle of order, 
rejection, pollution, sacrifice and redemption is repeated ad infinitum (1970, p. 224).  
Burke notes that, though texts such as The Bible are often interpreted teleologically, we 
actually read of “one broken covenant after another, and see the sacrificial principle 
reaffirmed anew” in an endless cycle (p. 217).  According to Burke’s entelechial motive 
theory, humans have a desire to repeat this cycle until perfection is achieved -- which, of 
course, will never occur (Burke; cited in Scheibel, p. 175).  This can be seen in repeated 
calls for apology even though apologies have been given before (such as Jane Stewart’s 
apology), because it was not the correct victim.  Burke writes that even for those who 

 
90 
believe that a perfect victim, Christ, was finally found to answer the problem of original 
sin and our supernatural predicament, we will still be searching for victims to blame for 
our earthly troubles (1970, p. 223).   
As discussed earlier, both personal and social cathartic release are forms of 
symbolic resolution, good at keeping problems at bay, but not necessarily leading to 
actual resolution.  In his 2011 study of the Boeing-Air Force Tanker Controversy, Ross 
Singer (2011) shows how coverage of the affair created a sense of national guilt which 
generated a need for cathartic scapegoating. As is so often the case with the scapegoat 
mechanism, the media avoided promoting a “public pedagogy for preventing additional 
harm and promoting long-term accountability,” as “coverage focused on tragic conflict 
within individuals” (p.99).  Singer argues that the “tragic form of issue containment 
suppressed public resistance and meaningful policy reform by limiting and distorting 
issues for discussion.  He adds that this media coverage “combined in a single point of 
concentrated public attention organized and presented as a coherent story of a classic 
fall from grace” and notes that in this manner the news coverage reinforced the 
perception of individual crime as an aberration rather than systemic (p.105).  We clearly 
see this in the media coverage of the apology for the Indian residential school system: 
the symbolic resolution offered by the tears of survivors contained the issue to a 
particular ‘chapter’ rather than bringing up issues of colonialism and systemic racism.   
We must also recognize the risks of solving problems through rhetoric.  Despite 
his optimism in regards to the benefits of the apology process on intra-national 
reconciliation, Griswold does point out some examples of how apologies have been 
used in a coercive manner such as the “re-education” camps in China and Cambodia 
(2007, p. 181).  He also warns of what one commentator has referred to as “contrition 
chic” that is “a bargain-basement way to gain publicity, sympathy and even absolution by 
trafficking in one’s status as victim or victimizer” (Elshtain, p. 40; quoted in Griswold, 
2007, p. 182).  After Harper’s apology, The Globe and Mail reprinted on its front page, 
that some natives felt the apology was “just a bunch of words” and “too little, too late” 
(cited in Bergen, 2009): symbolic sacrifice does not feed children or keep you warm in 
winter.  Our failure to fully address these issues in the apology is evidenced in events 
such as the crisis at Attawapaskat in the winter of 2011/2012, almost four years after the 
apology. 

 
91 
After then-Prime Minister Tony Blair’s apology for the wrongful conviction of 
suspected IRA bombers thirty years earlier, The Independent published an editorial 
stating: 
Hearing the Prime Minister say the words ‘very sorry’… reminds us how 
much easier it is to apologize for something that happened during 
someone else’s tenure than to regret mistakes you have committed 
yourself.  How about an equally public apology to the people of this 
country for taking us to war in Iraq over weapons of mass destruction that 
turned out not to exist? 
(quoted in Harris et al., 2006, p. 726) 
 As Girard (1977) argues, the “trick” of ritual is to transfer blame to someone 
whose victimization will not bring reprisal (p. 36); blaming former administrations will not 
bring reprisals to current governments.  Like Blair, Harper may have apologized for the 
sins of his predecessors, but he has not apologized for wrongdoing during his own 
tenure whether it be for Attawapaskat or Robocalls.  
5.2. Reasons for optimism 
 
Some may view this exploration as a cynical analysis of a sincere attempt at 
reconciliation between two historically antagonistic groups which have been brought into 
conflict because of colonization.  I have been, and surely will be, misinterpreted as 
seeing the apology as a useless public relations campaign by the Federal Government – 
but this is not the case.  As Robert Ivie (2007) writes “[h]umans, living within language 
and defined through symbolic action, may hope to reform their identities and relations to 
one another by means of tragicomic narrative and ritual dramas” (p. 242).  When one 
defines one’s identity anew through narrative and ritual, one is more likely to behave and 
relate to others in a manner more in tune with that new identity.  If, in defining its 
essence as a humane and egalitarian society in alignment with The Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms (1982) through this process Canada begins to act more in tune with this 
identity, then, surely, this is reason enough to applaud the apology. 
Moreover, as noted earlier, the words of the apology are not just useful in terms 
of their power of self-definition; they are also a useful tool in forcing governments to stay 
true to their words.  The very public nature of the apology process means that journalists 

 
92 
and opposition MPs can use the words of the apology against the government that 
issued them and force them to stick to the covenant.  Moreover, journalists can keep the 
ideals alive by continuing to cover the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation process 
and reminding all Canadians of the words of the apology as well as the values that they 
express.   
Though this is in no way an analysis of the success or failure of the apology 
process, I would like to point out that empirical research supports the notion that, at least 
in the domestic and civic context, apology contributes to peace and reconciliation 
(Griswold, 2007, p. 175).  In their analysis of ten countries which had attempted 
reconciliation after intra-national conflict, political scientists William J. Long and Peter 
Brecke conclude that: 
those countries that reconciled successfully, that is, restored lasting social 
order, did so through a protracted process of recognition of harm and 
public truth telling, redefinition of identities and social roles and 
antagonists, and partial justice short of revenge... An untidy, seemingly 
idiosyncratic, but undeniably patterned process of national forgiveness 
was 
the 
foundation 
of 
successful 
national 
reconciliations.  
 
 
(quoted Griswold, 2007, p. 177) 
Although the frame of scapegoating, which was revealed in this analysis of the 
apology and its media framing, is often worrying, Brewin (2011) argues that “modernity 
deals with the problem of violent sacrifice by displacing it from rituals such as the public 
execution to imaginary events, with the result that, in the words of Steven Pinker, ‘we’re 
getting nicer every day” (p. 20).  We can question the sincerity of the apology and fear 
the frame of the scapegoat, or its ability to create change, but we cannot claim that 
symbolic death via the humiliation of the public apology is worse than actual victimization 
of a scapegoat.  In a surprisingly optimistic twist, Burke (1989) explains how the “explicit 
ritual scapegoat” can save us from the deceptions of the “pseudoscientific” scapegoat.  
He explains that with the pseudoscientific scapegoat, the community projects all of its 
vices onto the scapegoat, and then takes it to be “scientific fact” that this is the 
scapegoat’s “true nature”.  On the other hand, with the explicitly appointed ritual 
scapegoat, we know that there is “an element of mummery in the process of 
transference and therefore can discount the notion that it intrinsically possesses these 
characteristics” (p. 298).  Although casting our society’s sins of the treatment of its 

 
93 
aboriginal people on to the symbolic head of the totem then sacrificing him may not deal 
with the actual problem of systemic racism, it is better than the alternative of blaming 
natives for their own problems.  While using Harper as a symbolic scapegoat may not 
address land-claims or other economic injustices, it is better than the alternative of using 
natives as a pseudoscientific scapegoat with claims that aboriginals are an inherently 
lazy race responsible for their own economic status and social conditions.  Though 
issues of the legacy of colonialism may not have been dealt with in the apology, at least 
there is increased recognition that the deplorable status of many aboriginals in Canada 
is not due to some genetic inferiority but rather, at least in part, due to the legacy of the 
Indian residential school system.  Apologies may not be as good as concrete actions at 
solving issues such as economic disparities, but, at least, they are able to mend old 
wounds better than mere ignoring or forgetting as they acknowledge the importance of 
past events on identities (Pettigrove, 2006, p 489).  As Pettigrove puts it, political 
forgiveness, is, at least, “clearly better than nothing” (p. 496). 
Although sociologists such as Singer (2011) note that “under a Burkean lens, a 
public request for a return to normalcy is a logical follow-up to the victimage ritual,” 
(p.108), does this return to normalcy mean that no social change has occurred? There is 
evidence that rituals of status reversal do not always merely serve to affirm and highlight 
the social order, for status reversal can be an instrument for social change (Erikson and 
Sunderland, 1998).  As I argued in Chapter Three of this thesis, ritual can have a 
reformatory function as its liminality allows us to see a vision of an ideal future, if only 
briefly.  Sadie Hawkins dances, where girls were allowed to choose their own dance 
partners, can be seen as allowing girls to, at least for one night, play with the idea of 
liberation from gender stereotypes and thus, in some small way, contribute to female 
empowerment.  Gay pride parades, in which generally degraded and oppressed sexual 
behavior is celebrated, can be seen as helping to shape acceptance rather than 
reinforce hetronormativity as strictly Turnerian interpretations of status reversal rituals 
would dictate.  Perhaps allowing Phil Fontaine to preside as carnival king, and allowing 
aboriginal elders to speak in the House of Commons, if only for one day, did change the 
moral order, if ever so slightly.  Perhaps young aboriginals took inspiration from this 
aberration rather than seeing its unusual character as reinforcing the status quo.  And 
most importantly, perhaps this one day of the world-turned-upside down created 

 
94 
empathy in the citizen domain by allowing us to hear the narrative of this affiliative 
domain, allowing it to enter into the grander narrative of what it means to be a Canadian.      
5.3. The Necessity of Further Research  
It is obvious that the theory presented here is in an early stage and much more 
analysis is necessary in order to draw conclusions regarding the effects of this framing 
on the conditions such as race relations and, particularly, the economic disparity 
between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in Canada.  As noted earlier, research 
into the effects of framing of particular issues such as welfare suggest that it does affect 
perceptions of issues among the populace, but research into framing on policy decisions 
is more scare.  Theorists such as Iyengar (cited in Semetko and Valkenburg, 2000, p. 
96), note that the “responsibility frame” is one of the most common frames in news 
media arguing that television news tends to frame issues episodically in terms of who is 
to blame instead of thematically in terms of complex socio-historical contexts. While 
Iyengar notes this to be true of US television news in reference to blaming individuals for 
their own situations (i.e. single mothers for their own poverty), Semetko and Valkenburg 
found that, in the Dutch press, it is often the government being blamed in the 
“responsibility” frame.”  They argue that this shows that the responsibility frame is highly 
influenced by the political and social context from which it both simultaneously emerged 
and is embedded.  If this is the case, then the fact that the residential school apology 
highlighted the government’s role in creating intergenerational trauma among Canadian 
natives is evidence of this responsibility frame.  More research should reveal if this frame 
actually influenced the political and social climate in of the Canadian government and 
civil society.   
5.3.1. 
Backlash 
Another key issue which necessitates further research, and a major fear among 
activists regarding public apologies, is that of backlash.  Conservative elements in 
society may react against ‘special treatment’ meaning that, as Lind notes, apologies may 
actually worsen the relations between victims and perpetrators (Lind; cited in Tang, 
2011, p. 716). Lind found that, in Japan, inter-state apologies often resulted in domestic 

 
95 
backlash.  This echoes Noble’s finding that inter-state apologies do not always lead to 
directly traceable positive outcome but they do generate debate on history and 
reconciliation (cited in Tang, p. 739).  Lind argues that before apologies can occur, 
groups must first reconcile without denying past wrongs.  Such suggestions remind us of 
the importance of following proper ritual procedure.   
In his discussion of interstate apologies, Tang (2011) suggests that proper 
educational and media campaigns surrounding the apology can quell backlash.  He 
points out that the Japanese have never instituted honest educational campaigns 
regarding their colonial past and have not been receptive to any apology to Japan’s 
wartime victims whereas there have been sustained educational campaigns in Germany 
and young Germans have thus been very receptive to public apologies.  Tang suggests 
that we must address the issue of time in regards to backlash noting that education is 
aimed at the next generation so it is only possible to see the impact of educational 
campaigns on reducing backlash after ten years at minimum.  After such time has 
passed, he argues that we must ask:  “First, was there an educational reform that 
explicitly repudiated the past within the perpetrator’s educational system or was there 
merely a whitewash of the crime?  Second, how sustained had the reform been?”  
However, Tang does not produce any empirical research to confirm his conclusions 
regarding the importance of education and backlash and hedges his argument with the 
statement that “it is not always so straightforward to identify a causal direction between 
events when one looks at them in a longer horizon” (p. 740).  Obviously, more research 
on the causes of backlash is in order. 
5.4. The Future 
As Shiping Tang (2011) notes, acts such as the apology are part of a process of 
“peace building, not peace in itself” (p. 714).  Although the point of this thesis is not to 
make suggestions regarding the steps towards reconciliation and particularly not policy, I 
would like to point the reader to the work of Apache-American legal scholar William C. 
Bradford.  In regards to relations between indigenous people in the United States and 
non-indigenous Americans, Bradford discusses the theory of Justice as Indigenism (JAI).  
He writes that, “JAI commits its practitioners to a sequential process consisting of seven 

 
96 
distinct 
stages: 
acknowledgement, 
apology, 
peacemaking, 
commemoration, 
compensation, land restoration, legal reformation, and reconciliation,” seeing legal 
reformation as “the capstone in a broader structure of remedies, including the restoration 
of Indian lands and the reconciliation between Indian and non-Indian peoples” (cited in 
Buck, 2006, p. 116).  He suggests the establishment of a truth commission in America 
(p. 117) very much like the TRC in Canada.  It looks like Canada is at least two- 
sevenths of the way down this road.  Let us hope that we continue on this path through 
commemoration of apology which allows it to become part of our national narrative (such 
as placing a framed copy in every classroom), proper compensation for victims and 
ultimately the settling of land claims and reformation of the Indian act.

Appendix A: Statement of Apology to former students of 
Indian Residential School 
The treatment of children in Indian Residential Schools is a sad chapter in our history. 
For more than a century, Indian Residential Schools separated over 150,000 Aboriginal children 
from their families and communities. In the 1870's, the federal government, partly in order to meet 
its obligation to educate Aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development and 
administration of these schools.  Two primary objectives of the Residential Schools system were 
to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, 
and to assimilate them into the dominant culture.  These objectives were based on the 
assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some 
sought, as it was infamously said, "to kill the Indian in the child".  Today, we recognize that this 
policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country. 
One hundred and thirty-two federally-supported schools were located in every province and 
territory, except Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.  Most schools were 
operated as "joint ventures" with Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian or United Churches.  The 
Government of Canada built an educational system in which very young children were often 
forcibly removed from their homes, often taken far from their communities.  Many were 
inadequately fed, clothed and housed.  All were deprived of the care and nurturing of their 
parents, grandparents and communities.  First Nations, Inuit and Métis languages and cultural 
practices were prohibited in these schools.  Tragically, some of these children died while 
attending residential schools and others never returned home. 
The government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian Residential Schools policy 
were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on 
Aboriginal culture, heritage and language.  While some former students have spoken positively 
about their experiences at residential schools, these stories are far overshadowed by tragic 
accounts of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect of helpless children, and their 
separation from powerless families and communities. 
The legacy of Indian Residential Schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist 
in many communities today.  
It has taken extraordinary courage for the thousands of survivors that have come forward to 
speak publicly about the abuse they suffered.  It is a testament to their resilience as individuals 
and to the strength of their cultures.  Regrettably, many former students are not with us today and 
died never having received a full apology from the Government of Canada. 
The government recognizes that the absence of an apology has been an impediment to healing 
and reconciliation.  Therefore, on behalf of the Government of Canada and all Canadians, I stand 
before you, in this Chamber so central to our life as a country, to apologize to Aboriginal peoples 
for Canada's role in the Indian Residential Schools system. 
To the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family members and communities, the 
Government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their 
homes and we apologize for having done this.  We now recognize that it was wrong to separate 
children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions that it created a void in many lives and 
communities, and we apologize for having done this.  We now recognize that, in separating 
children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own 
children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, and we apologize for having done this.  
We now recognize that, far too often, these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were 
inadequately controlled, and we apologize for failing to protect you.  Not only did you suffer these 
abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children 
from suffering the same experience, and for this we are sorry. 

 
111 
The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long.  The burden is 
properly ours as a Government, and as a country.  There is no place in Canada for the attitudes 
that inspired the Indian Residential Schools system to ever prevail again. You have been working 
on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining 
you on this journey. The Government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of 
the Aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly.

We are sorry

In moving towards healing, reconciliation and resolution of the sad legacy of Indian Residential 
Schools, implementation of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement began on 
September 19, 2007. Years of work by survivors, communities, and Aboriginal organizations 
culminated in an agreement that gives us a new beginning and an opportunity to move forward 
together in partnership. 
A cornerstone of the Settlement Agreement is the Indian Residential Schools Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission.  This Commission presents a unique opportunity to educate all 
Canadians on the Indian Residential Schools system.  It will be a positive step in forging a new 
relationship between Aboriginal peoples and other Canadians, a relationship based on the 
knowledge of our shared history, a respect for each other and a desire to move forward together 
with a renewed understanding that strong families, strong communities and vibrant cultures and 
traditions will contribute to a stronger Canada for all of us. 
On behalf of the Government of Canada 
The Right Honourable Stephen Harper, 
Prime Minister of Canada

Appendix B: Methodology 
Content Analysis of Frame 
 
Frames are notoriously difficult to measure as they “consist of tacit rather than overt 
conjectures” (Maher; cited in Konig, n.d.).  Moreover, owing to their subjective nature, it is often 
difficult to separate the views of the researcher from the frame itself (Van Gorp, 2005, p.503; cited 
in Matthes and Kohring, 2008, p. 258).  As Gameson states, “We know from years of content 
analysis that it is difficult if not impossible, to get adequate reliability with such a genotypic 
category as a frame” (quoted in Matthes and Kohring, p. 263).  So how does one go about 
measuring frames?  According to media analysts Matthes and Kohring, it is important to identify 
the single elements of the frame.  They state that these are not words, but “previously defined 
components or devices of frames” (p. 263). Once these are coded for, a cluster analysis of these 
elements will reveal the frame itself.  Indeed, for Matthes and Kohring, this is the definition of a 
frame: a pattern of elements which support and generate narratives. 
 
Content analysis of media frames can be approached inductively and deductively 
(Semtko and Valkenburg, p. 94).The inductive approach keeps an open view to coding a wide 
variety of frames while the deductive approach pre-defines the frames to be examined.  While an 
inductive method can lead to exciting and unexpected results, it is labour intensive and difficult to 
replicate.  Although the deductive approach can overlook frames that have not been predefined, it 
can be replicated more easily and is less labour intensive - allowing for more sources to be used - 
and can more easily detect differences in framing between media (e.g. television versus 
newspapers) and within media (e.g. mainstream versus alternative). For this reason, I used a 
flexible deductive approach: I began with set ideas about the frames I was looking for but 
continuously re-coded for new ideas, terms and keywords which emerged from the articles16. I 
then developed a coding scheme using approximately thirty of these elements. I continued to 
keep the approach of critical discourse analysis in mind while coding the texts, paying attention to 
the power relationships at play in the apology, and noting who was quoted in each article and why 
those individuals and groups were given voice17.   
Selection of Data: 
 
I began this analysis of the apology and its media framing by selecting media from a 
cross-section of ownership and region.  Although the examination is mostly based on print media, 
I also include transcripts from Canada’s two major national broadcasters as well as some web-
only sources.  I attempted to include articles from before the apology, directly after the apology, 
and more recent articles.  I retrieved the articles using the search terms “apology” and “residential 
schools” (and “les excuses” “les systeme des pensionnats autochtones” in French) on the 
proquest database and the websites of various media outlets.  I included articles from corporate 
 
16  It may be of interest that I began this analysis coding for Girard’s scapegoat mechanism and 
it is only after repeated reading of the texts that I re-coded for the elements one would expect 
in Burke’s (1970) cycle as well as aspects of re-covenanting. 
17  Although I am aware that there are several computer programs to assist in coding keywords, 
I am wary of their ability to identify synonyms, homonyms, metaphor and, particularly relevant 
to this study, political euphemism.  Moreover, as the observation of the importance of 
metaphoric language in heightening spectacle (Dayan and Katz, 1992, p. 108) is key to this 
project, I did all of the coding manually. 

 
113 
sources such as The Globe and Mail newspaper -- Canada’s most widely-read national 
newspaper, which is published in Toronto and attempts to present a national opinion, and other 
urban newspapers including as The Winnipeg Free Press, published in the home of Canada’s 
largest urban native population.  I also examined articles from the non-profit independent news 
website rabble.ca and one public media source -- the website of the Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation.  In addition, I examined articles from indigenous news sources including 
Windspeaker – Canada’s largest aboriginal newspaper . I also used articles from Le Devoir, 
Canada’s largest French-language newspaper, as well as several smaller community 
newspapers from communities with a high percentage of aboriginals.  I included transcripts of the 
Hansard and other articles from the Postmedia website which were reprinted in several small 
papers across the country.  Along with the Canadian press coverage, I examined a limited 
number of articles from international sources.
