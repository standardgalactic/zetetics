PROBLEMS 
6-1 Formulation 
The basic idea behind the combinational approach is extremely simple and 
was noted many years ago by Van der Waerden (1941). The problem is to 
evaluate the partition function ZN (Equation 1.7 of Chapter 5), which can be 
written in the form 
where the starred product is over nearest-neighbor lattice points P and Q, 
ν = JfkT, and the sum is over all configurations of the lattice (μΡ = ± 1). 
Expanding the exponential in Equation 1.1 and noting, since μ\ = +1, that 
zN = Σ π* exPO^P μς>), 
(1.1) 
W P. Q 
(1.2) 
we have 
βχρ(νμΡμβ) = cosh ν + μ Ρμ α  sinh ν 
= cosh v(l + ωμ Ρμ Q), 
where 
ω = tanh v. 
(1.3) 
(1.4)

We can then write the partition function, Equation 1.1, in the form 
(1.5) 
where q is the lattice coordination number and N is the number of lattice 
sites (so that 
is the total number of nearest neighbor bonds). 
We now expand the product in Equation 1.5, 
(1.6) 
and represent each product 
corresponding to a nearest-neighbor pair 
of lattice points P and Q by a bond on the lattice connecting P and Q. For 
example, each term in the coefficient of co has the representation shown in 
Figure 6.1 and each term in the coefficient of 
has either the representation 
(a) or (b) shown in Figure 6.2. In case (a), 
(1.7) 
and in general any point that appears an even number of times in a product 
of fi's has its 
replaced by 1. Similarly, any point that appears an odd 
number of times has a n remaining. Since 
(1.8) 
it then follows from Equations 1.5 and 1.6 that 
(1.9) 
where w(0) = 1 and n(r) is the number of graphs that can be constructed from 
r bonds on the lattice with the restrictions that (1) no bond can occur more

than once in a given graph, and (2) only an even number of bonds can meet 
at a lattice point (e.g., 0,2, or 4 for the square lattice). The problem is therefore 
reduced to counting graphs on a lattice. For simplicity we shall refer to graphs 
satisfying conditions (1) and (2) as closed graphs. 
This approach is clearly ideally suited to generating series expansions since 
one has merely to count graphs. The number of graphs n(r), of course, be­
comes enormous as r increased, particular for three-dimensional lattices. 
Nevertheless, a relatively large number of terms have been calculated (15 
or so in three dimensions). These expansions are our only real source of exact 
information in three dimensions. We shall have more to say about this in 
Section 6-5. 
To illustrate the counting procedure let us consider the two-dimensional 
square lattice wrapped on a torus. Clearly, there can be no graphs satisfying 
conditions (1) and (2) for r = 1, 2, or 3. For r = 4 the unit square shown in 
Figure 6.3 is the only possible graph, and since it can be in any one of N 
places, 
w(4) = W; 
(1.10) 
in other words, there is one square per site. When r = 5 there are no graphs 
satisfying the required conditions, and in fact the reader can easily convince 
himself that 
n(r) = 0 
for r odd. 
(I ll) 
When r = 6 there are two possible graphs shown in Figure 6.4 and since 
there are N of each, 
n(6) = 2 N; 
(1.12)

in other words, there are two hexagons per site. When r — 8 we can have the 
connected graphs shown in Figure 6.5, giving a total or 7N graphs, or a dis­
connected graph consisting of two disjoint squares. With one square fixed 
there are N — 5 possible positions for the other square, giving a total contribu­
tion of %N(N — 5). It follows that 
„(8) = 77V + ±N(N - 5) 
= \N2 + 
. 
(1.13) 
For larger r the problem rapidly becomes complicated, so we shall stop at 
this point.

FIGURE 6.5. Contributing connected eight-bond graphs. 
From Equation 1.9 to 1.13 we have that 
(1.14) 
For large N, 
should be proportional to N (since we know from Chapter 
exists). To see how this comes about from Equation 
1.14 we take logarithms of both sides of Equation 1.14 and formally expand 
the logarithm of the bracketed term. If we do this and retain only terms up to 
we obtain 
which has the required form. The important point to note is that the N2 term 
in Equation 1.14 cancels when one computes the free energy. The expansion 
of the logarithm of Equation 1.14 is not legitimate, since the series diverges 
for sufficiently large N. One obtains the same result, however, by taking 
(1.16) 
expanding the right-hand side in a binomial series and equating coefficients 
with those in Equation 1.14. This process can be made perfectly rigorous. 
In general, if r is less than the circumference of the torus

dimensions), n(r) is a polynomial of degree m < r/4 (or < r/3 if triangles can 
occur), i.e., 
Taking logarithms as above, the coefficients of N 2, ...,N m  vanish and we are 
left with 
The problem then is to compute a(r1] in Equation 1.17. More detailed dis­
cussions of the counting problem can be found in the review articles by Domb 
(1960) and Fisher (1965, 1967). 
An exact evaluation of ZN in two dimensions based on the combinational 
formula 1.9 was first attempted by Kac and Ward (1952). Their idea was to 
express the generating function for the graph-counting problem (i.e., the 
partition function 1.9) as a determinant of a matrix. They succeeded in con­
structing a matrix to give the Onsager result, but they were unable to prove 
that all graphs were counted correctly (although clearly " most" graphs must 
have been counted correctly). Sherman (1960) showed that not all graphs were 
counted correctly by the Kac-Ward matrix, but with the aid of a conjecture 
of Feynmann, which Sherman himself proved, he was able to make the Kac-
Ward argument completely rigorous. 
A variant of the Kac-Ward method emerged in the early 1960s when a 
number of Ising-model enthusiasts became aware of Pfaffians, which were 
known to mathematicians last century but were subsequently forgotten. This 
method will be discussed in Section 6-3, where the Ising problem is related to 
a dimer problem that can be solved by Pfaffians. 
6-2 Low-temperature Expansions and Lattice Duality in 
Two Dimensions 
Since ω = Ianh(JjkT) is small when T is large, the combinational formula 
1.9 gives a high-temperature expansion for the partition function. Low-tem-
perature expansions can be developed in a similar manner if we start from the 
completely ordered state (corresponding to zero temperature), i.e., when all 
n(r) = Na^ + Ν 2α< 2 )  + · · · + N ma ( r m\

spins are up or all spins are down (for H = 0), and successively flip neighbor­
ing spins. The first term in the low-temperature expansion for ZN with H = 0 
is, then, from Equations 1.6 and 1.7 of Chapter 5, 
2exp (iNvq), 
(2.1) 
the " 2 " in front coming from the all-up or all-down symmetry of the ground 
state. The next term is obtained by flipping one spin. The energy of such a 
configuration is 
— ^NqJ + 2qJ 
(2.2) 
and there are 2N such configurations, so the first two terms in the low-
temperature expansion for ZN are given by 
Zn = 2 exp(%Nvq)(l + N exp( — 2vq) + ···)· 
(2.3) 
In general we can write 
ZN = 2 exp(iM^) £ m(r)exp( - 2vr), 
(2.4) 
r = 0 
where m{0) = 1 and m(r) is the number of ways r pairs of unlike neighbors 
can be arranged on the lattice. The generalization of this formula for nonzero 
magnetic fields is the subject of Problem 2. 
We now introduce the notion of a dual lattice. For the square lattice shown 
in Figure 6.6, the dashed square lattice is the dual lattice (the square lattice is 
" self-dual ")· In general, the dual of a given lattice is obtained by drawing the 
perpendicular bisector through each bond of the original lattice and con­
necting the new bonds at points in the center of each unit cell of the original 
lattice. For example, as shown in Figure 6.7, the dual of the triangular lattice 
is the hexagonal lattice and vice-versa. 
In a given configuration of up spins (denoted by +) and down spins 
(denoted by —) dashed lines are drawn through each bond connecting an 
up and a down spin. A typical situation is shown in Figure 6.8 for the square 
lattice. In general, it is clear that broken bonds on the original lattice give 
closed graphs on the dual lattice, and, in fact, there is a one-to-one correspon­
dence between broken bonds on the original lattice and closed graphs on the 
dual lattice. In other words, from the definitions of m(r) and n(r), 
n(r) = mD(r) 
and 
m(r) = nD(r), 
(2.5) 
where mD(r) denotes the number of ways r pairs of unlike neighbors can be

If we now define

it is obvious from Equations 2.4 and 1.9 that (exhibiting the temperature 
dependence) 
(2.7) 
where ZD denotes the partition function of the dual lattice and ND and qB 
denote the number of lattice points and the coordination number of the dual 
lattice, respectively. In general there is a bond of the dual lattice for each bond 
of the original lattice, i.e., 
so from Equations 2.6 and 2.7 it 
follows that 

154 
The Ising Model: Combinatorial Approach Ch. 6 
Z(v) = Z d(V*)2 1~ N D(2 sinh Ivf 1*. 
(2.8) 
Since the square lattice is self-dual, Z D  = Z, so from Equation 2.6, Equation 
2.8 relates the square-lattice partition function at a low temperature (large v) 
to the square-lattice partition at a conjugate high temperature (small v*) 
and vice-versa. It follows that singularities must occur in pairs, and if there is 
one, and only one, singularly it must occur when ν = ν*, i.e., from. Equation 
2.6 when 
tanhv = e-2v 
or 
sinh2v = l, 
(2.9) 
which is precisely the equation (Equation 5.12 of Chapter 5) determining the 
critical point in the Onsager solution. 
Unfortunately, the above argument does not work in three dimensions, 
since there is no three-dimensional analogue of the dual lattice. Equation 2.8 
also does not locate the critical points of the triangular and hexagonal lattices. 
Onsager, however, using a slightly different trick (the "star-triangle trans­
formation") was able to relate the low-temperature expansion for the 
triangular-lattice partition function to the low-temperature expansion for 
the hexagonal-lattice partition function. This, combined with the duality 
relation 2.8, locates the critical points for both lattices, which are given by 
These ideas have been generalized by Fisher (1959a), who has located the 
critical points of all sorts of interesting-looking lattices. 
Historically, the relation 2.8 was first deduced by Kramers and Wannier 
(1941) from symmetry properties of the transfer matrix for a (two-dimensional) 
helical lattice. In this way they deduced the exact critical point (2.9) three years 
before the appearance of Onsager's solution. The lattice duality argument 
given above is due to Onsager [see Wannier (1945)]. 
6-3 Dimer Solution of the Ising Model in Two Dimensions 
The dimer problem seems first to have been considered by Fowler and 
Rushbrooke (1937), who attempted to calculate the entropy of a gas of 
diatomic molecules absorbed on a crystalline surface. 
A simplified version of this problem in two dimensions is to find the

number of ways of covering a square lattice with dimers, a dimer being an 
object that covers bonds connecting nearest-neighbor lattice sites, with the 
restriction that a given lattice site cannot be occupied by more than one dimer. 
To solve this problem it is convenient to consider the generating function 
defined by 
¢(21.22)= 
Σ 
9(n 1, n^rl'zS2, 
(3.1) 
IIl1H2 
(m+n2 = JV/2) 
where g(n y, n 2) is the number of dimer configurations with M1 horizontal dimers 
and n2 vertical dimers, and N is the total number of lattice sites (assumed to be 
even). The total number of dimer configurations is clearly Φ(1, 1), so the prob­
lem will be solved once we have evaluated Equation 3.1. 
The generating function, Equation 3.1, is similar in form to the partition 
function of the two-dimensional rectangular Ising model. Thus if spins in 
rows have interaction constant J1 and spins in columns have interaction 
constant J2, a straightforward generalization of the argument leading to 
Equation 1.9 gives 
00 
Z N  = (2 cosh V1 cosh v 2) N  £ n(R, s)coicu|,

where n(r, s) is the number of closed graphs with r horizontal bonds and s 
vertical bonds, and 
Vi = -j^> 
ω> =tanh v.' 
i=l> 2· 
(3-3) 
The trick now is to set up a one-to-one correspondence between closed 
graphs on the square lattice and dimer configurations on another, appropriate 
two-dimensional "dimer lattice." The simplest dimer lattice found to date 
[Fisher (1966)] is the rather decorative one shown in Figure 6.9. Its simplicity 
comes from the fact that the dimer configurations corresponding to closed 
graphs are planar; i.e., there are no overlapping dimers (see Figure 6.11). 
Kasteleyn (1963), who was the first to relate the Ising and dimer problems, 
constructed a dimer lattice having overlapping dimer configurations which 
caused considerable difficulties. 
We now set up a one-to-one correspondence between every possible 
closed-graph configuration on the square lattice and dimer configurations on 
Fisher's dimer lattice (Figure 6.9). 

156

FIGURE 6.9. Fisher's dimer lattice. 
The first thing to note is that the square and dimer lattices can be built out 
of the unit cells shown in Figure 6.10. The unit cells in both cases have four 
"terminals" and the bonds of the original lattices are now represented by 
dashed lines in the figure. 
If the dimer lattice has the same number of unit cells as the square lattice 
it is obvious that a one-to-one correspondence can be set up between the unit 
cells of the two lattices. Moreover, we can build up any closed graph on the

square lattice from the eight distinct unit-cell types shown in Figure 6.11, 
the solid lines in the unit cell now corresponding to half a graph bond on the 
lattice. We then set up a one-to-one correspondence between bonded square-
lattice unit cells and dimer configurations on the dimer-lattice unit cells as 
shown in Figure 6.11. In view of the one-to-one correspondence between cells 
and cell configurations, we can then set up a one-to-one correspondence 
between closed graphs on the square-lattice and dimer configurations on 
Fisher's dimer lattice. It follows from Equation 3.2 that if we assign a weight 
CO1 to dimers passing through terminals 1 or 3 (see Figure 6.10), a weight ω2 to 
dimers passing through terminals 2 or 4, and a weight 1 to the interior dimers,

tions on the square lattice and dimer configurations on Fisher's lattice.

the partition-function equation (3.2) can be related to the dimer-generating 
function Of(O)1 , ω2) for Fisher's lattice through 
ZN = (2 cosh V1 cosh V2JwO^1, ω 2). 
(3.4) 
The relation between the dimer and Ising problems was first noted by 
Kasteleyn (1963). Previously, Kasteleyn (1961) and Temperley and Fisher 
(1961), independently, solved the dimer problem with the aid of Pfaffians. 
Pfaffians are interesting objects (see Appendix E) which were known to 
mathematicians last century [Thomson and Tait (Bi 879)], but since they 
appeared to be mathematically uninteresting they were rapidly forgotten. 
Pfaffians were revived in the 1950s by Caianello, who was busy evaluating 
vacuum expectation values in quantum field theory. It turned out that 
Pfaffians were ideally suited for the job. Hurst and Green (1960) quickly saw 
a connection and reevaluated Onsager's solution via vacuum expectation 
values and Pfaffians. A full account of their work can be found in Green and 
Hurst (B1964). Almost simultaneously, Kasteleyn, and Fisher and Temperley, 
solved the dimer problem with the aid of Pfaffians. 
Solutions of the dimer problems on a square lattice, and Fisher's lattice, 
which gives the Ising-model partition function Equation 3.4, are given in 
Appendix E. 
The final result for the number of dimer configurations D on a square 
lattice is

6-4 Correlation Functions and Susceptibility 
The pair-correlation function 
in zero field is defined by (Equation 
6.1 of Chapter 5) 
(4.1) 
In the algebraic formulation of the problem 
/z,> is expressed in terms of the 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transfer matrix (Equations 6.15 and 6.24 
of Chapter 5). In the combinational approach we formulate 
as a 
graph-counting problem, as follows. 
Expanding the exponentials in Equation 4.1, making use of Equation 1.3, 
we obtain 
(4.2) 
Multiplying out the product in Equation 4.2 and arguing exactly as before 
(Equations 1.5 to 1.9) we see that all previous closed graphs contribute to the 
expansion of 
in powers of tanh v, but now the vertices k and / must 
contain an odd number of bonds rather than an even number in the expansion 
1.9 of the partition function 
Typical graphs are shown in Figure 6.12. 
A graph such as (a), with free ends and no intersections, corresponds to a 
self-avoiding walk from site k to / along the bonds of the lattice. No bond can 
occur more than once in a given graph, but self-intersections such as in (b) are 
allowed. The self-avoiding walk graphs of n bonds (or n steps) in a sense give 
the dominant contribution to the nth term in the tanh v expansion, but other 
graphs of course contribute. 
FIGURE 6.12. Typical graphs contributing to the high-temperature 
expansion of the pair-correlation function

The Ising Model: Combinatorial Approach Ch. 6 
The self-avoiding walk problem is of some independent mathematic interest, 
and also of interest as a simple model of a polymer chain. Typically one is 
interested in the number c„ of «-step self-avoiding walks and the mean-square 
end-to-end distance <>„2> of η step walks. In one dimension the problem is 
trivial but in higher dimensions virtually nothing is known rigorously except 
that Iimn^00 n~l log cn exists [Hammersley (1957)]. A great deal of con-
figurational information in the form of exact enumeration of walks is known, 
however. Numerical analysis of such data (see the following section) and 
various heuristic arguments [e.g., Edwards (1965)] suggests that if c„ ~ μ"η9 
and 
~ne as η -> oo, then the "exponents" g and θ are ^ and f in two 
dimensions, and ^ and f in three dimensions, respectively. These numbers are 
very intriguing, especially the conjecture that 
(Note that θ = 1 is the exact value for unrestricted random walks in any 
dimension.) 
The behavior of the pair-correlation function for large separations of the 
two spins essentially determines the behavior of the zero-field susceptibility 
Xo(T) in the neighborhood of the critical point. To see this we now derive 
the so-called fluctuation relation

Now, in zero field above the critical point the magnetization

To derive Equation 4.7 
we then must interchange a limit with an infinite sum. These operations appear 
reasonable, but as yet there is no proof of their validity. 
Granted Equation 4.7, however, we can, following Fisher (1959b), deduce 
the high-temperature critical behavior of 
from the known rigorous 
asymptotic behavior of the two-dimensional pair-correlation functions.

angular dependence. We therefore write

which should be valid as 
Subsequently we shall ignore 
the angular dependence of A and C. More detailed discussions of this point, 
and Equation 4.10, are given by Fisher (1959b), Kadanoff (1966), and Wu 
(1966). Replacing the sum by an integral (in polar coordinates) in Equation

section. 
6-5 Numerical Analysis of the Three-dimensional Ising Model 
We have remarked already that the basic combinatorial formula (1.9) is a 
high-temperature expansion and that one can compute n(r), the number of 
closed graphs which can be constructed on the lattice, for values of r that 
are not too large. The degree of difficulty in computing n(r) increases extremely 
rapidly with r, and even with modern high-speed computers it takes an enor­
mous amount of time and effort to compute n(r) for r larger than about 10 or 
so. Be that as it may, the development of series expansions for the partition 
function and other thermodynamic quantities begun some years ago by 
Wakefield (1951), Domb (1949), and others has now become, in the hands of 
Domb, Sykes, and co-workers at King's College, London, an art in itself. 
A large number of terms are known for various high- and low-temperature 
expansions for thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat, spontaneous 
magnetization, magnetic susceptibility, etc., on almost all conceivable lattices 
in two and three dimensions. The problem is to make the maximum use of 
this vast amount of information. What one would like to know, of course, is 
the location of the critical point and the behavior of various thermodynamic 
quantities in the neighborhood of that point for the three-dimensional Ising 
model. 
Mathematically speaking, the simplest problem that could conceivably 
arise is the following: Given the first N terms a0, A1, ..., 
in the series 
expansion of a function f(x), 
can one deduce the location of the critical point xc and the value of the critical 
exponent y?

Sec. 6-5 Numerical Analysis of the Three-dimensional Ising Model 
The answer simply is no, whatever the value of Nl Consider, for example, the 
function 
For this function, the first N terms obviously give us no information whatever 
about the singularity at χ = 1. The basic philosophy, then, or belief if you 
like, is that for Ising models the coefficients quickly settle down to the asymp­
totic behavior dictated by the singularity. Mathematically, this amounts to 
making some analytical assumptions about the function in question, and 
unfortunately we have no such information in three dimensions. We do, 
however, have information, in fact exact information, in two dimensions, so 
this provides a valuable testing ground for our numerical techniques. Thus, 
if it works in two dimensions, we hope that it also works in three dimensions. 
On the historical side it is interesting to note that with no knowledge of 
the Onsager formula for the two-dimensional spontaneous magnetization 
m0, Domb (1949) obtained series expansions for m0 and using elementary 
extrapolation techniques (described below) suggested that m0~ (Tc — T)118 
as T-*TC—, which is absolutely correct (see Equation 5.22 of Chapter 5). 
For reasons that we will state in a moment, the best (i.e., most well behaved) 
series to examine are the high-temperature zero-field susceptibility [χ0(Τ)] 
series. In two dimensions the critical point is known exactly, but since the 
external magnetic field problem is unsolved, the exact formula for χ0(Τ), or 
even its critical behavior, is not known rigorously. The " semirigorous 
argument" in the previous section, however, suggests that χ0(Τ) is charac­
terized by a high-temperature exponent y = i (see Equation 5.1) in two di­
mensions. We will see that the numerical methods support this value very 
strongly. 
High-temperature expansions for χ0(Τ) can be readily developed as dis­
cussed in the previous section, and in two and three dimensions one finds that 
all available terms (typically 20 in two dimensions and 15 in three dimensions) 
are positive, which means that the closest singularity to the origin must be on 
the real positive ω — tanh(JjkT) axis, and consequently must correspond to the 
physical critical point (there will in general be other nonphysical singulari­
ties in the complex ω plane). The asymptotic behavior of coefficients in a 
series expansion of a function is determined by the closest singularity [the 
physical singularity in the case of χ0(Τ)]> and the asymptotic behavior is 
(5.2)

naturally approached more rapidly if the closest singularity is sufficiently 
strong and well separated from other singularities. Fortunately, both these 
conditions appear to be fulfilled by the high-temperature susceptibility series. 
To be a little more precise now, consider the high-temperature susceptibility 
expansion

For example, the triangular lattice series is given by

If all coefficients 
in Equation 5.3 are positive (and there is no strict proof), 
<oc is the closest singularity to the origin. It then follows from the binomial 
theorem that the asymptotic form of the coefficients is given by 
(5.7) 
The ratio of successive coefficients, therefore, has the asymptotic form

From Equation 5.8 Iimn^00 y„ = γ. Values for y„ from Equation 5.4 are

which are increasing smoothly, suggesting that 
y = 1.749 + 0.003, 
(5.13) 
and it is extremely tempting to conjecture that 
γ = i 
exactly. 
(5.14) 
Fisher's argument given in the previous section supports this value, but as 
we have already remarked, Equation 5.14 cannot yet be considered as exact. 
A similar sequence is obtained for the face-centered-cubic γ, which suggests 
that 
V= 1.250 ±0.004, 
(5.15) 
and if one " believes," one would conclude that 
y = i 
exactly. 
(5.16) 
The above method is usually referred to as the ratio method. Domb and 
Sykes (1961) used this method to obtain the results stated above. 
So far we have only mentioned the " nice " series. The susceptibility series 
for the two-dimensional square and hexagonal lattices, and the three-dimen­
sional simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices (the "loose-packed 
lattices "), for example, have oscillating ratios r„ caused by the presence of a 
(antiferromagnetic) singularity at —a>c. The plots of r„ vs. n'1 in these cases 
are sawtoothed, so extrapolation is more difficult than for the triangular and 
face-centered-cubic lattices. The limit of rn as «-» oo is still ω'1, however, 
so what one does is either extrapolate the even and odd ratios separately or, 
better still, their arithmetic mean. The final results compare reasonably well 
with the triangular and face-centered-cubic results and suggest that J and f 
are the universal susceptibility exponents in two and three dimensions, 
respectively. (Recall that in two dimensions the specific heat and spontaneous 
magnetization have the same exact critical behavior for all lattices.) 
The existence of a singularity at — Mc for the loose-packed lattices is exact 
and can be deduced immediately from the basic combinational formula (1.9). 
Thus, as was shown in Section 6-1, only even powers of ω = tanh ν occur in 

Sec. 6-5 Numerical Analysis of the Three-dimensional Ising Model 
167 
the expansion of the square-lattice partition function. The same is true of all 
loose-packed lattices, and one concludes that if there is a singularity at +a>c 
there must also be a singularity at -coc. For an antiferromagnet /<0, 
hence tanh ν < 0 for T > 0, so — <uc corresponds to the antiferromagnetic 
singularity. 
Although the occurrence of a pair of singularities at ±<nc disturbs the 
ratio method, the symmetry can be exploited [Guttmann et al. (1968)] if one 
makes one assumption about the form of χ0(Γ)—that the ferromagnetic 
singularity factors, i.e., 
where Λ(ω) is analytic in the disc |ω| <wc except at the point ω = — coc, 
where 
The assumption 5.17 is not at all rigorous, but it appears from the series that 
it is probably true, or if not, it is very close to being true. 
From Equations 5.17 and 5.18 we deduce that the function 
is singular at — coc and is analytic everywhere else in the region | ω | < mc. 
It follows that the coefficients of powers of ω/ω,, in the expansion of λ(ω) 
alternate in sign and decrease in magnitude (provided a, Equation 5.18, is 
less than unity). The numerical procedure then is to choose trial values 
coc and γ for ωΓ and y, generate the series for λ(ω) (Equation 5.19), and see in 
fact if the coefficients alternate and decrease. In this way one obtains, with 
the aid of a computer, a set of possible values for a>c and y, which turn out to 
form a closed region in the a5c, y plane. A typical situation is shown sche­
matically in Figure 6.14 [see Guttmann et al. (1968)]. 
We can carry the above procedure further by multiplying the series (Equa­
tion 5.19) by powers of [1 + (ω/ω,.)] (for trial values of <»c). This accelerates 
the rate of convergence of the series if the exact ω€ (and y) are chosen, and 
amplifies any errors in the guessed values for coc and y. Multiplying succes­
sively by [1 + (ωlojc)]n, η = 1,2,..., gives a sequence of smaller and smaller

One cannot, however, proceed indefinitely, since multiplying by powers of 
amplifies the effects of other singularities. This shows up in 
irregular behavior of the initial coefficients for 
and makes it more 
difficult to judge if the series has settled down to the required alternating and 
decreasing behavior. It was found that with the available terms, n = 2 was 
about the largest reasonable value. For the square lattice, using the exact 
value 
the following results were obtained: 
(5.20) 
where the value of n refers to the power of 
as described above. 
For the simple cubic lattice, where a>c is not known, the results obtained were 
as follows: 
(5.21) 

Sec. 6-5 Numerical Analysis of the Three-dimensional Ising Model 
169 
Both results, Equations 5.20 and 5.21, suggest very strongly that y = J in two 
dimensions and y = f in three dimensions. One amusing result, assuming 
y = 
exactly for the simple cubic lattice is that 
ω, = 0.2181437 ± 0.0000004 
(n = 2), 
(5.22) 
which is obtained from 11 terms of the series! 
For the close-packed lattices (triangular and face-centered-cubic) one does 
not have a singularity at —cac. Such a singularity can, however, be introduced 
by considering the series for Χο(Τ)χ0(—Τ). The above method can then be 
applied to this series and the results are almost as good as Equations 5.20 
and 5.21. For example, for the face-centered-cubic lattice one obtains (from 
eight terms) 
γ = 1.30 ± 0.30 
ω, = 0.10179 ± 0.00280 
(« = 0)

0.10175 ±0.00013 
(« = 2). 
Further results for the Ising model and self-avoiding walk problem can be 
found in Guttmann et al. (1968). So much for the well-behaved series. 
Specific-heat series are difficult to analyze because the singularity is so weak 
(logarithmic in two dimensions and probably a small power in three di­
mensions). The above trick unfortunately does not work on specific-heat 
series because the (ferromagnetic) singularity almost surely does not factor 
(it certainly does not factor in two dimensions). Nevertheless, a straight­
forward analysis of the ratio of successive coefficients for the face-centered-
cubic lattice suggests that the high-temperature specific-heat exponent α 
is probably £. 
Low-temperature series in powers of ζ = exp(—2JjkT) (see Equation 2.4) 
are particularly difficult to analyze in three dimensions since with the excep­
tion of the diamond lattice, which we shall discuss in a moment, the series do 
not converge up to the physical singularity. For example, the simple cubic 
lattice appears to have its closest singularity on the negative ζ axis, so the ratio 
method gives us information about this unphysical singularity rather than the 
singularity of physical interest (i.e., the closest singularity on the positive 
ζ axis). The distribution of singularities in the complex ζ plane for the simple-
cubic, body-centered-cubic, and face-centered-cubic lattices is shown in 
Figure 6.15 [see Guttman (1969a)].

A number of methods have been applied to such series, one of the most 
successful to date being the method of Pade approximants [Baker (1961)]. The 
idea behind this method is to approximately analytically continue a series 
beyond its radius of convergence (i.e., the distance from the origin to the 
closest singularity) to examine the singularity of interest. 
The [iV, M] Pade approximant of a function 
is defined by 
(5.24) 
where 
(5.25) 
are polynomials of degree M and N, respectively. Without loss of generality 
we can choose 
The remaining 
coefficients 
are chosen so that the coefficients of the power-series expansion 
of [N, M] agree with the first K (known) coefficients of the function /(z). To 
determine the

so that if Pti(Zi) = Ri φ 0, and Z i  is a simple root, 
[Ν, M] ~ Ri^l 
as z-* Z i. 
(5.27) 
Clearly, if the function f(z) has only simple poles the Pade approximants will 
locate the positions of the singular points very accurately (in fact, exactly 
from [Ν, M] if /(z) has N poles). 
To apply these ideas to the problem at hand, let us suppose that we have a 
function /(z) which behaves as 
/ ( Z ) ~A{\ -|-j ' 
as ζ ^ Z1.

It follows that

which has the required form for application of the Pade approximant method. 
Note that even if there are singularities closer to the origin than the one of 
interest [as there are for typical low-temperature Ising-model series in the 
variable ζ = exp(—2J/kT)], the closest positive zero of QN(z) to the origin 
in the [Ν, M] Pade approximant to (d/dz)[logf(z)] should converge to the 
required singular point, and the residue of the pole at this point should, from 
Equation 5.29, converge to the critical exponent y. Normally one considers 
[Ν, N] Pad6 approximants, but others may be used (e.g., [Ν ± 1, N]). Un­
fortunately, convergence properties of such Pad6 approximants are poorly 
understood, particularly in cases of interest, where taking the logarithmic 
derivative almost surely introduces branch points (this is, indeed, the case 
unless all singularities factor). In fact, some Pade approximants may not 
exist, which is also the case for some Ising-model series, so some care must be 
exercised with this method. Pad£ approximants do, however, work reasonably 
well on high-temperature susceptibility series, as shown in Table 6.1 (see

Equations 5.20 and 5.21), so one can have some confidence in applications 
of the method to low-temperature series. As examples, Pad6 sequences for 
the low-temperature spontaneous magnetization exponent β (see Table 6.1) 
obtained by Essam and Fisher (1963a) are 
0.3106, 0.3032, 0.3120, 0.3218, 0.3133 
for the simple cubic lattice, and 
0.2824, 0.3045, 0.2970, 0.3029, 0.3161, 0.3089, 0.3067, 0.3115 
for the face-centered-cubic lattice. 
From these and other sequences Essam and Fisher suggested that 
β = Te 
exactly in three dimensions 
(5.30) 
independently of the lattice. For the interested reader, a more detailed dis­
cussion of applications and convergence properties of Pade approximants 
can be found in Baker (1965). 
The diamond lattice series, as we have mentioned, converge up to the 
physical singularity, so the simple ratio method can be applied. Essam and 
Sykes (1963b) applied this method to the logarithmic derivative of the spon­
taneous magnetization series and obtained the following sequence for β: 
0.2974, 0.2995, 0.3031, 0.3059, 0.3071, 0.3081, 0.3088, 
which supports the suggestion that β = Te (Equation 5.30). 
The low-temperature susceptibility series are unfortunately not very smooth. 
The Pad6 sequences for the exponent y' (see Table 4.1) are consequently rather 

Sec. 6-5 Numerical Analysis of the Three-Dimensional Ising Model 
173 
irregular [Essam and Fisher (1963a)], and one cannot do much better than 
estimate y' = 1.28 + 0.05. If one accepts the basic dogma in this field, however 
—that all critical exponents are rational numbers—the only "possible" 
values for y' are f or I1^ (notice that the denominators of all exponents are 
then multiples of 4!). Recent Pade work on longer low-temperature suscepti­
bility series, and on various indirect methods [Baker and Gaunt (1967) and 
Gaunt and Baker (1970)] have unfortunately failed to distinguish con­
vincingly between the two "chosen values" for γ'. There are also insufficient 
terms available at present for the low-temperature susceptibility series on the 
diamond lattice to do any better than the Pade analysis on other series. 
Recently, however, it was noted [Guttmann and Thompson (1969b)] that all 
low-temperature series in three dimensions converge up to the critical point 
in the variable χ = 1 — ta.nh(JjkT) (which is small when T is small). One pays 
the price, however, by having an uncomfortable number of singularities 
(e.g., eight for the face-centered-cubic lattice) close to the physical disc 
|x| < xc in the complex χ plane. Nevertheless, one does rather well using 
only a mild extension of the ratio method on the logarithmic derivative of the 
various series. For example, one obtains the following sequence for the simple 
cubic exponent β: 
0.2970, 0.2968, 0.3009, 0.3022, 0.3017, 0.3018, 0.3026, 0.3036, 
0.3042, 0.3044, 0.3046, 0.3049, 0.3055, 0.3060, 
which support the value β = 
and the following sequence for the simple 
cubic exponent y': 
1.238, 1.243, 1.251, 1.263, 1.281, 1.293, 1.299, 1.301, 1.303, 
1.305, 1.308, 1.310, 1.311, 
which is increasing, suggesting after one has played the game for a while that 
y' = Ij3ff (=1.3125) exactly! Unfortunately, the sequences for other lattices 
are not quite as regular, and for these one cannot completely rule out the 
possibility that y' = f. The high-temperature susceptibility exponent y, as 
we have seen, is probably f for all lattices. Various heuristic arguments 
(scaling, etc., discussed in Section 4-7) favor high temperature-low tempera­
ture, exponent symmetry (i.e., y = y' and also α = α' for the specific heat), so it 
would be very nice if y' in fact turned out to be 
From the above sequence 
for y', however, this may turn out not to be the case. 
Low-temperature specific heat series are almost impossible to analyze

exponents, α, α', β, y, and γ', are, respectively, the high- and low-temperature

α' + /?(1 + .5) = 2. 
Numerical estimates for other exponents, characterizing decay of correla­
tions, etc., can be found in Fisher (1967) and Stanley (B1971). 
There are finally two points to note: 
1. The Ising-model exponents appear to depend only on dimensionality 
(and rather dramatically so) and not on the particular lattice (for a, a', and β 
this is exactly so for the two-dimensional Ising model). There is also a feeling 
among some people that the exponents do not depend on the range of inter­
action (as long as it is effectively finite). There is some numerical support for 
this feeling [Dalton and Wood (1969)], but at the moment it is not completely 
convincing. 
2. The three-dimensional Ising-model exponents are not too different from 
the experimental values (at least they are closer to the experimental values than 
the classical exponents). Presumably the difference comes from the rigid and 
anistropic nature of the Ising model. (Numerical estimates for the more 
realistic isotopic Heisenberg model are in fact closer to the experimental 
values.) Hopefully if one could understand the two- and three-dimensional 
Ising-model exponents in a simple heuristic way, one would be well on the 
way to understanding the values that occur in nature.
