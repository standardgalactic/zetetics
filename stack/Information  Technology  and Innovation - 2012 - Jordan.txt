Preface
The Outer Banks of North Carolina is a chain of barrier islands located 
off the eastern shore of the state. Most famous for the Kitty Hawk dunes 
where the Wright Brothers ﬁ rst achieved powered ﬂ ight, the Banks have 
a long, rich history. The pirate Edward “Blackbeard” Teach sailed out of 
Ocracoke Island, while the treacherous waters offshore have claimed doz-
ens of ships over the centuries. In World War II, German submarines sunk 
merchant vessels there; divers recovered an Enigma decoder machine 
from one such German submarine in 1981. Merchant hunters once used 
massive shotgun-like weapons to down hundreds of duck and geese in a 
single outing on the 30-mile wide Pamlico Sound.
For hundreds of years, the Banks were remote and hard to get to; 
this quality, along with the wind and sand, was part of the appeal to the 
Wrights. The 1960s saw the beginning of a period of rapid growth and 
discovery by the outside world. Bridges and causeways replaced some 
of the ferries, world-record marlin were caught by Hatteras Island char-
ter captains, and the rapid growth of such southeastern cities as Atlanta, 
Raleigh-Durham, Charlotte, and the Washington, DC area helped drive 
a rapid increase in tourism. Finally, the rise in such adventure sports as 
surﬁ ng, windsurﬁ ng, and kiteboarding coincided with the area’s unique 
 combination of wind and waves to draw international attention to the area. 
For all the snowboarder-like attitude, however, ﬁ shing—on the sound in a 
skiff, in the Gulf Stream from a 50-foot “battle wagon,” or off the beach—
was and remains a massive draw to the area.
Despite the modernization, the islands remain prone to hurri-
cane damage. The fragile barrier islands are continually shifting and 
extreme storms can breach the thin islands. While the sunshine and miles 
of white sand beaches, many of them protected from development as 
part of a national seashore, exert their pull toward escape and relaxation, 
locals keep a close eye on the weather. Evacuation routes are clearly 
marked and frequently used. After one hurricane, renters were given ﬂ yers

Preface
asking them to be patient with storekeepers and restaurant waitstaff inso-
far as some of them had just lost their homes.
The Outer Banks is clearly a unique locale, a barrier island ecosys-
tem with a rich history. Inspired by the Foxﬁ re experiment in oral history 
begun by a Georgia English teacher in the 1960s, the local high school 
interviewed longtime residents for an excellent series of recollections. As 
recently as the 1990s, weather information was displayed in block letters, 
much like old IBM text-based PCs, on local cable television. Wireline tele-
phone coverage was spotty: some calling cards worked better than oth-
ers. The New York Times, Sunday or otherwise, was impossible to obtain. 
Renting a house involved a mimeographed list of options and a toll-free 
telephone call to a property management ﬁ rm. Being removed from the 
rat race was part of the Banks’ appeal.
The rapid growth of the Sun Belt, combined with the real estate 
bubble of 1995 to 2008, encouraged building and more building. Houses 
grew bigger. Pools became the norm, even for oceanfront houses. Real 
estate ﬁ rms multiplied, and moved from mimeograph to black-and-white 
offset printing to thick, slick full-color catalogs. The Washington Post and 
Sunday New York Times inﬁ ltrated the islands, as did upscale restaurants. 
Cell phone service improved; high-speed Internet access became a routine 
feature of the rental properties.
As of 2011, the Outer Banks feels less isolated than ever before. Some 
property managers have dispensed with paper catalogs altogether, moving 
instead to online guides that feature Google Earth aerial imagery, video 
walk-throughs of the properties, and extensive photo galleries. The New 
York Times, the BBC, and Al Jazeera are all equally and easily available. 
Weather channels and resources have proliferated.
Cell phone coverage can extend up to 20 miles offshore. It’s great 
for the ﬁ shing guides but just as useful for making the BlackBerry work. 
Wi-Fi in many rental houses makes tuning out an act of will rather than a 
default state of affairs. Anonymity becomes less common: A colleague of 
ours was on the same island as we were on a recent visit, a fact we dis-
covered through Facebook. His page even told us what music he listened 
to while there.
Local retailers of everything from books to kiteboard gear to ﬁ shing 
tackle now ship worldwide from online storefronts. Fishing guides and 
restaurateurs look to Match.com for a social life, claiming that “It’s hard 
to develop a relationship with people who are only here a week at a 
time.” Political organizers have turned to the Web as court decisions to 
protect nesting birds and sea turtles have restricted beach access for ﬁ sh-
ing and other recreation. One of the main bridges connecting the islands 
is in need of substantial repairs, and there are online petitions and other 
resources devoted to that cause as well.

Preface 
xvii
Relentless improvements in electronic connection have brought many 
changes to life on these islands. Personal safety during extreme weather, 
health care, and retail selection, particularly in the off season, have 
increased by a sizable extent. At the same time, the Outer Banks is no 
longer unique: In a highly connected world, anyplace can to a degree 
become everyplace. Getting CNN, and Twitter, and e-mail just as easily in 
an island paradise as in an airport Hilton also has consequences.
This book attempts to explore the intersection of our connecting tech-
nologies and our institutions, and the changes that come to business as a 
result. For a variety of reasons—not all of them related to the Internet—
making a living, ﬁ nding a partner, and other essential, deﬁ ning pursuits 
are changing. Just as with life on the Banks, the changes are happening 
fast, but often invisibly, particularly for the young. The book began as an 
undergraduate class on global information technology strategy, an exercise 
in looking closely at the ways in which information and technology alter 
the business landscape. My objective is neither to be a cheerleader for IT 
nor to lament the lost glories of years gone by. Rather, I hope to identify 
both the imperative and the resources for still-deeper innovation as we 
extend the impact of the information revolution to more strata of society, 
more areas of the globe, and ultimately more workers.
This book’s argument has ﬁ ve phases. First, some basic facts about 
technology, management, and economics are examined to set some 
context. The second section is concerned with how humans organize 
resources and do work in the changing landscape. Business model dis-
ruption and innovation is the focus of seven case studies in Section III. 
A number of particular technologies that can serve as innovation 
resources—building blocks, as it were—are discussed in Section IV. 
Finally, the last section sketches out ﬁ ve broad areas of rapid change in 
the foreseeable future.

SECTION I
Foundations
For all the breadth of today’s technology and business landscape, a surpris-
ingly small number of general principles underlie many patterns of behav-
ior. These principles, however, derive from several areas of the social and 
behavioral sciences that are usually considered in parallel rather than jointly. 
At base, the paradox of information technology lies in how much more 
potential remains to be explored, particularly in the economic realm.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction
If you watch exponential change for long enough, the effects grow 
beyond comprehension. In the late 1990s the technology analyst George 
Gilder was fond of telling the story of “the second half of the chessboard.” 
Here is one version:
The emperor of China was so excited about the invention of chess 
that he offered the inventor anything he wanted in the kingdom. 
The inventor thought for a moment and said, “One grain of rice, 
Your Majesty.” “One grain of rice?” the puzzled emperor asked. 
“Yes, one grain of rice on the ﬁ rst square, two grains of rice on 
the second square, four grains of rice on the third square, and so 
on through the 64 squares on the chessboard.” The emperor read-
ily granted that seemingly modest request. Of course, there are two 
possible outcomes to this story. One is that the emperor goes bank-
rupt because 2 to the 64th power grains of rice equals 18 million 
trillion grains of rice, which would cover the entire surface of the 
earth with rice ﬁ elds two times over.1
The story highlights one of the critical facts of contemporary life: 
Improvements in digital technologies are possible at scales never experi-
enced in previous domains. As a 2005 advertisement from Intel pointed 
out, if air travel since 1978 had improved at the pace of Moore’s law of 
microprocessor price/performance (one of Gilder’s doubling technolo-
gies), a ﬂ ight from New York to Paris would cost about a penny and take 
less than one second. Cognitively, physically, and collectively, humanity 
has no background in mastering change at this scale. Yet it has become 
the expectation; the list later in this chapter should be persuasive.

Introduction
Given the changes of the past 40 years—the personal computer, the 
Internet, Global Positioning Systems (GPS), cell phones, and smartphones—
it’s not hyperbole to refer to a technological revolution. This book explores 
the consequences of this revolution, particularly but not exclusively for 
business. The overriding argument is straightforward:
 
 Computing and communications technologies change how people 
view and understand the world, and how they relate to each other.
 
 Not only the Internet but also such technologies as search, GPS, MP3 
ﬁ le compression, and general-purpose computing create substantial 
value for their users, often at low or zero cost. Online price compari-
son engines are an obvious example.
 
 Even though they create enormous value for their users, however, 
those technologies do not create large numbers of jobs in western 
economies. At a time when manufacturing is receding in importance, 
information industries are not yet ﬁ lling the gap in employment as 
economic theory would predict.
 
 Reconciling these three traits will require major innovations going 
forward. New kinds of warfare and crime will require changes to 
law and behavior, the entire notion of privacy is in need of reinven-
tion, and getting computers to generate millions of jobs may be the 
most pressing task of all. The tool kit of current technologies is an 
extremely rich resource.
Cognition
Let’s take a step back. Every past technological innovation over the past 
300-plus years has augmented humanity’s domination over the physical 
world. Steam, electricity, internal combustion engines, and jet propulsion 
provided power. Industrial chemistry provided new fertilizers, dyes, and 
medicines. Steel, plastics, and other materials could be formed into sky-
scrapers, household and industrial items, and clothing. Mass production, 
line and staff organization, the limited liability corporation, and self-service 
were among many managerial innovations that enhanced companies’ abil-
ity to organize resources and bring offerings to market.
The current revolution is different. Computing and communications aug-
ment not muscles but our brain and our sociability: Rather than expanding 
control over the physical world, the Internet and the smartphone can com-
bine to make people more informed and cognitively enhanced, if not wiser. 
Text messaging, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook allow us to maintain both 
“strong” and “weak” social ties—each of which matters, albeit in different 
ways—in new ways and at new scales. Like every technology, the tools are

value neutral and also have a dark side; they can be used to exercise forms 
of control such as bullying, stalking, surveillance, and behavioral tracking. 
After about 30 years—the IBM Personal Computer (PC) launched in 1981—
this revolution is still too new to reﬂ ect on very well, and is of a different 
sort from its predecessors, making comparisons* only minimally useful.
For a brief moment let us consider the “information” piece of “infor-
mation technology” (IT), the trigger to that cognitive enhancement. 
Claude Shannon, the little-known patron saint of the information age 
(see Figure 1.1), conceived of information mathematically; his fundamen-
tal insights gave rise to developments ranging from digital circuit design 
to the blackjack method popularized in the movie 21. Shannon made key 
discoveries, of obvious importance to cryptography but also to telephone 
engineering, concerning the mathematical relationships between signals 
and noise. He also disconnected information as it would be understood in 
the computer age from human uses of it: Meaning was “irrelevant to the 
*When Al Gore called the Internet the “Information Superhighway” in 1978, it was 
a perfect example of this disconnect.

Introduction
engineering problem.”2 This tension between information as engineers see 
it and information that people generate and absorb is one of the deﬁ n-
ing dynamics of the era. It is expressed in the Facebook privacy debate, 
Google’s treatment of copyrighted texts, and even hedge funds that mine 
Twitter data and invest accordingly. Equally important, however, these tech-
nologies allow groups to form that can collectively create meaning; the edi-
torial backstory behind every Wikipedia entry, collected with as much rigor 
as the entry itself, stands as an unprecedented history of meaning-making.
The information revolution has several important side effects. First, it 
stresses a nation’s education system: Unlike twentieth-century  factories, 
many information-driven jobs require higher skills than many members of 
the workforce can demonstrate. Finland’s leadership positions in education 
and high technology are related. Second, the beneﬁ ts of information ﬂ ow 
disproportionately to people who are in a position to understand informa-
tion. As the economist Tyler Cowen points out, “a lot of the Internet’s big-
gest beneﬁ ts are distributed in proportion to our cognitive abilities to exploit 
them.”3 This observation is true at the individual and collective level. Hence 
India, with a strong technical university system, has been able to capitalize 
on the past 20 years in ways that its neighbor Pakistan has not.
Innovation
Much more tangibly, this revolution is different in another regard: It has yet 
to generate very many jobs, particularly in ﬁ rst-world markets. In a way, it 
may be becoming clear that there is no free lunch. The Internet has created 
substantial value for consumers: free music, both illegal and now legal. Free 
news and other information such as weather. Free search engines. Price 
transparency. Self-service travel reservations and check-in, stock trades, and 
driver’s license renewals. But the massive consumer surplus created by the 
Internet comes at some cost: of jobs, shareholder dividends, and tax rev-
enues formerly paid by winners in less efﬁ cient markets.4
In contrast to a broad economic ecosystem created by the  automobile 
industry—repair shops, drive-in and drive-through restaurants, road-build-
ers, parking lots, dealerships, parts suppliers, and ﬁ nal assembly plants—
the headcount at the core of the information industry is strikingly small 
and doesn’t extend out very far. Apple, the most valuable company by 
market capitalization in the world in 2011, employs roughly 50,000 
people, more than half of whom work in the retail operation. Compare 
Apple’s 25,000 nonretail workers to the industrial era, when headcounts 
at IBM, General Motors, and General Electric all topped 400,000 at one 
time or another. In addition, the jobs that are created tend to be in a very 
narrow window of technical and managerial skill. Contrast the hiring at

Microsoft or Facebook to the automobile industry, which in addition to 
the best and the brightest could also give jobs to semiskilled laborers, toll-
booth collectors, used-car salesmen, and low-level managers. That reality 
of small workforces (along with outsourcing deals and offshore contract 
manufacturing), high skill requirements, and the frequent need for exten-
sive education may become another legacy of the information age.
In the past 50 years, computers have become ubiquitous in American 
businesses and in many global ones. IT has contributed to increases in efﬁ -
ciency and productivity through a wide variety of mechanisms, whether 
self-service Web sites, automated teller machines, or gas pumps; improved 
decision making supported by data analysis and planning software; or 
robotics on assembly lines. The challenge now is to move beyond opti-
mization of known processes. In order to generate new jobs—most of the 
old ones aren’t coming back—the economy needs to utilize the comput-
ing and communications resources to do new things: cure suffering and 
disease with new approaches, teach with new pedagogy, and create new 
forms of value. Rather than optimization, in short, the technology revolu-
tion demands breakthroughs in innovation, which as we will see is con-
cerned with more than just patents.
There are of course winners in the business arena. But in the long 
run, the companies that can operate at a sufﬁ ciently high level of innova-
tion and efﬁ ciency to win in brutally transparent and/or low-margin markets 
are a minority: Amazon, Apple, Caterpillar, eBay, Facebook, and Google 
are familiar names on a reasonably short list. Even Dell, HP, Microsoft, and 
Yahoo, leaders just a few years ago, are struggling to regain competitive 
swagger. Others of yesterday’s leaders have tumbled from the top rank: 
Merrill Lynch was bought; General Motors and Chrysler each declared bank-
ruptcy. Arthur Andersen, Lehman Brothers, and Nortel are gone completely. 
How could decline happen so quickly?
Given our era’s place in the history of technology, it appears that struc-
tural changes to work and economics are occurring. To set some context, con-
sider how mechanization changed American agriculture after 1900. Because 
they allowed fewer people to till the land, tractors and other machines drove 
increased farm size and migration of spare laborers to cities. Manufacturing 
replaced agriculture at the core of the economy. Beginning in 1960, computers 
helped optimize manufacturing. Coincident with the rise of enterprise and then 
personal computing, services replaced manufacturing as the main employer 
and value generator in the U.S. economy. In short, innovation could be to 
information what mechanization was to agriculture: the agent of its marginal-
ization and the gateway to a new economic era.
How IT relates to this shift from manufacturing to services and, 
potentially, a new wave of innovation is still not well understood; to take 
one example, as Michael Mandel argued in Bloomberg Businessweek, a

Introduction
shortfall of innovation helps explain the misplaced optimism that con-
tributed to the ﬁ nancial crises of the past years.5 But rather than merely 
incant that “innovation is good,” I believe that the structure of economic 
history has certain limits, and computers’ propensity for optimization may 
be encountering one such limit. It takes people to innovate, however, and 
identifying both the need as well as the capabilities and resources neces-
sary for them to do so may be a partial path out of the structural eco-
nomic stagnation in which we ﬁ nd ourselves.
Consider Dell, which achieved industry leadership in the 1990s 
through optimization of inventory control, demand creation, and the 
matching of the two. The 2000s have treated the company less well. Apple, 
which like Dell boasts extremely high levels of supply chain  performance, 
has separated itself from the PC industry through its relentless innovation. 
Seeing Apple pull away with the stunning success of the iPhone, Google 
in turn mobilized the Android smartphone platform through a different, 
but similarly effective, series of technical and organizational innovations. 
In contrast to Apple and Google, optimizers like Dell are suffering, and 
unsuccessful innovators including Nokia are making desperate attempts 
to compete. Successful innovation is no longer a matter of building bet-
ter mousetraps, however: The biggest winners are the companies that can 
innovate at the level of systems, or platforms.
The Macro Picture
At the risk of missing some important nuances, three broad issues— 
globalization, the shift from manufacturing to services, and stagnant 
middle-class wage growth—need to be considered in tandem with the 
technology and associated business changes that serve as the primary 
focus of this book. It should be noted at the outset that coincidence does 
not imply causation: To assert that the rise of the information era hap-
pened in the same period as a transition from manufacturing to services 
should not be taken to say one caused the other. In fact, some other 
dynamic may have caused both. That said, powerful forces need to be 
acknowledged before analyzing the technology sector by itself. We have 
more to say about each of the topics in the coming chapters.
Globalization
The rise of globalization (regardless of how it is deﬁ ned) and the rapid 
diffusion of the Internet and mobile phones are neatly aligned in time, 
taking off around 1989. Figure 1.2 shows one effort to measure globaliza-
tion, building on three factors: Economic, social, and political inputs all 
inform this index, which was created by KOF, a Swiss think tank.6 These

are imprecise measures, to be sure, but it is difﬁ cult to argue, even anec-
dotally, that the world is less “global” than it was 20 years ago.
In addition, the developing world in particular is being transformed 
by extremely rapid adoption of cellular phones and mobile data. We 
address this phenomenon in more detail in chapter 12, but note the sim-
ilarity of the curves in Figure 1.3 showing the same effect in disparate 
countries: Usually after competition is introduced into a market, people

and familial reasons.
Rise of the Services Sector
After about 1950, the manufacturing sector declined as a component of U.S. 
gross domestic product (GDP). Services, whether provided by banks, retail 
shops, hairstylists, the health care sector, or professionals such as lawyers for 
government employees, grew at a stunning rate in both employees and eco-
nomic impact. As Figure 1.4 illustrates, given that governments lagged private 
companies in shedding jobs after 2008, government (an additional component 
of the services sector) was actually larger than goods-producing employment.
Stagnant Middle-Class Wage Growth

Figure 1.5 shows. Thus, the computer can be argued to have introduced 
efﬁ ciency improvements into the economy, but only the top 20 percent of 
wage earners harvested the majority of those gains.
In short,
 
 U.S. workers are competing with producers of goods and services in 
many lands.
 
 Most U.S. workers have not seen real wage increases in decades.
 
 American workers are increasingly unlikely to make things.
Why these things happened at the same time as the rise of computing 
remains a puzzle.

Switching from macro context to the topic at hand, it is a commonplace 
to state that we live in extraordinary times. Rather than merely assert this, 
however, it doesn’t take a lot of digging to ﬁ nd data: In nearly every year 
for the past 15, a new industry has been jump-started, an old one crip-
pled, or a new way of looking at the world propagated. Consider a quick 
timetable that ignores such developments as PayPal, Wikipedia, Twitter, 
Craigslist, AOL, online mapping, or the iPod:

Introduction
1995  Adoption of the Netscape browser goes from 0 to 38 million users in 
18 months, the world’s fastest technology take-off to date.
1996  Windows 95 sells 1 million copies in its ﬁ rst four days on the mar-
ket, many through physical retailers, and later serves as gateway 
to the Net for millions of users via Internet networking support, 
CD-ROM, and native modem drivers.
1997  Dell focuses on supply-chain and related innovations as opposed 
to lab-based research and development, the norm at IBM and or 
HP. As the world’s businesses and households strive to join the 
online migration, the build-to-order model surges in popularity for 
desktop conﬁ guration. IBM soon exits the business, while such 
manufacturers as Digital, Compaq, Gateway, and others either fade 
or get absorbed in consolidations. From an also-ran position in 
1996, Dell more than doubled its global market share in ﬁ ve years, 
becoming the number-one PC producer.7
1998  Linux and Apache explode in market share for server operating 
systems and Web server software respectively. Linux shipments tri-
pled, not counting free downloads; Apache powered the majority 
of Web sites as sampled by the Netcraft measurement ﬁ rm,8 par-
ticularly as compared to Microsoft’s competing Internet Information 
Server. The fact that neither product emerged from a traditional 
development process, from a corporation, or from a monetary trans-
action stymied many industry observers who contended that the 
open-source model simply could not work.9
1999  Annual DVD player sales quadruple from 1 million to 4 million, an 
astonishing rate of adoption for a physical product (as opposed to 
virtual Netscape software downloads).
2000  Shortly after its launch in June 1999, Napster redeﬁ ned the music 
landscape. Rather than attempt to use the tool for promotion in 
the manner of radio, the music industry wanted to shut down all 
peer-to-peer ﬁ le sharing. Because it employed a centralized direc-
tory structure, Napster was vulnerable to legal action in ways later 
distributed models were not; much of the enterprise’s brief his-
tory was spent in or around courtrooms. Twenty-ﬁ ve million users, 
many of them college students enjoying broadband speeds that 
few other populations could access, ﬂ ocked to the service, which 
shut down in 2001. In a fascinating secondary outcome to the 
ascendency of MP3 music, manufacturers including Bose, Yamaha, 
and Harman International witnessed a 93% — 93%! — drop in sales 
of stand-alone audio components over the next four years.10
2001  After indexing a billion Web documents and contracting with 
Yahoo to power the latter’s search bar in 2000, Google rapidly 
becomes essential; the American Dialect Society called the verb its

“word of the year” for 2002, and the term entered both Merriam-
Webster and the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006. Counting part-
nerships, Google handled about 85% of all Web searches as of 
early 2004 before Yahoo pulled out of the agreement and built its 
own capability. A staggering succession of acquisitions—including 
Pyra (Blogger), Keyhole (Google Earth), YouTube, GrandCentral, 
and Hans Rosling’s Gapminder—followed, none of which contrib-
uted meaningful revenues as compared to the core search business.
2002  According to Instat, wireless local area network shipments rose 
65% from 2001 to 2002.11 Business shipments of 11.6 million units 
led the way, and with home shipments of 6.8 million units, the 
total market revenue totaled $2.2 billion. Given that the more 
familiar term for this technology—Wi-Fi—entered the Merriam-
Webster dictionary in 2005, it’s no surprise that it became a 
 multibillion-dollar industry only three years after launch. Even 
more signiﬁ cantly, wireless networking entered all those homes 
and businesses one at a time: There was no “Sputnik moment,”* 
no tax credit, no policy mandate, no Big Blue† or Ma Bell.‡ 
Instead, particularly on the consumer side, the rapid adoption rep-
resents  millions of trips to Best Buy or the equivalent. Combined 
with wide deployment of cable modems and DSL connections in 
this same period, lots of U.S. citizens weaned themselves off the 
acoustic modem in a surprising short period of time, without any-
one making much of a fuss.
2003  In yet another quiet transition that was barely remarked on, cell 
phones surpassed landline connections in the United States, rep-
licating the norm in essentially every other country in the world. 
At about the same time, digital cameras overtook their analog 
equivalents (Kodak stopped making ﬁ lm cameras entirely in 2004); 
shortly afterward, dedicated digital cameras would in turn be 
usurped by cell phone cameras. In one brief moment, two stable, 
ubiquitous technologies dating to the late nineteenth century were 
surpassed by digital counterparts.
2004  No technology can compare to the wireline phone for reach in the 
United States, where “universal service” is literally the law of 
the land. After 100 years, more than 97% of households had phone

Introduction
 service; the average household had 1.3 lines. The 1–2 punch of 
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP; the phone service offered 
by Vonage, Skype, and cable operators’ triple plays) and mobile 
changed that in a hurry: Wireline penetration is heading south of 
40% less than 15 years after peaking. Equities markets took notice 
of the VoIP take-off and began depressing telecom valuations 
accordingly, cellular growth notwithstanding. Skype, meanwhile, 
has grown enormous: As of March 2011, up to 29 million concur-
rent users are logged in. The total installed base was roughly the 
same size as Facebook, with 663 million users at the end of 2010, 
at which time the service accounted for 13 percent of all interna-
tional calling minutes—on the entire planet. From launch through 
2009, users had completed 250 billion minutes of calls.12
2005  GPS is another technology that seeped into mainstream adoption 
without anyone making an editorial point of noting a breakout 
year, yet its ubiquity cannot be ignored. In 2004, GPS on a mobile 
phone was successfully proven; it rapidly became a key compo-
nent of the mobile platform. The original $12 billion investment 
by the U.S. Department of Defense spawned a commercial  market 
worth $13 billion in 2003 alone; recent estimates predict a $70  billion 
annual GPS market spend by 2013, with location-based services 
expected to comprise $10 billion by themselves.13
2006  Following its launch in April 2005, YouTube soared from 50  million 
page views per day after barely six months live to hit 7 billion 
on several days in August 2006. At the time of its acquisition by 
Google, 100 million videos had been uploaded. Every one of them 
had the capacity to reach a worldwide audience for zero distri-
bution cost and minimal, if any, production expense. As of mid-
2011, 48 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute 
of every day. The ability to review, catalog, or analyze such a 
ﬂ ood of content still lies in the future.14
2007  While Amazon refuses to release unit sales ﬁ gures for the e-reader 
launched in 2007, one statistic about electronic books merits men-
tioning: Kindle book sales in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2011 eclipsed 
Amazon sales of all print books combined. In other words, a tech-
nology dating back nearly to Gutenberg (1398–1468) was eclipsed 
in market share in less than four years, although it will bear watch-
ing to see how much the Kindle converted nonreaders and how 
much it took market share away from physical media.
2008  According to Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker’s statistics, the 
iPhone (counted along with its Wi-Fi-only iPod Touch sibling) 
reached 50 million customers faster than any piece of hardware in 
human history and jump-started the entire smartphone market.

2009  Facebook claimed an incredible 600 million users in roughly six 
years after launch, as Figure 1.6 illustrates. The breakout year was 
2009, as membership doubled off of a substantial base from about 
150 million to 350 million.
2010  Apple sold 3 million iPads in less than 90 days. This matches the 
sales rate of the DVD after ﬁ ve years in the market. Even more 
telling is the calculation by Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore 
that if the iPad counted as a PC, it completely rewrites the laptop 
market share scoreboard, putting Apple on top by a comfortable 
margin—after one calendar quarter.15

Given this steady pattern of exponential change, it appears likely that 
the pace of innovation will not slow and, in fact, should increase still 
further if more people are to share in the economic beneﬁ ts of the 
information revolution. For all that is new, though, there’s a sense in 
which this period is somehow familiar: Many technologies and prac-
tices related to them are variations on previous ideas.

Introduction
among distributed users. James Goodnight, the widely respected 
founder and chief executive ofﬁ cer of SAS Institute, an analytics 
software company, stated that “the cloud is nothing more than 
a damn big server farm.” He elaborated: “Google [and] Amazon 
had these huge server farms that they had to have to store all the 
data and they got all these CPUs [central processing units] that 
aren’t that terribly busy. Why not try to sell them off? Sell some 
of the time,’’ he said. “What we’re talking about here is a concept 
called time sharing. That’s all it is. We’ll sell you a piece of our 
hardware if you give us X number of dollars. In this case, it’s real 
cheap. But that’s all it is, time-sharing.”16
 
 The notion of a device with access to one’s personal library of 
facts, history, and other information was foretold by Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology engineering dean Vannever Bush in a 
device he called a memex, which seemingly supercharged the 
microﬁ lm reader*:
Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of 
mechanized private ﬁ le and library. It needs a name, and to 
coin one at random, “memex” will do. A memex is a device in 
which an individual stores all his books, records, and com-
munications, and which is mechanized so that it may be con-
sulted with exceeding speed and ﬂ exibility. It is an enlarged 
intimate supplement to his memory.
It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be oper-
ated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at 
which he works. On the top are slanting translucent screens, 
on which material can be projected for convenient reading. 
There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise 
it looks like an ordinary desk.17
 
 For as much attention as the iPad and other tablets are receiv-
ing, the original design brief can in some ways be traced to Alan 
Kay, who has been associated with fundamental inventions in 
object-oriented computing and the windowing behavior of the 
modern graphical user interface. Explained in a 1972 paper, Kay’s 
*A mid-twentieth-century technology for storing magazines, newspapers, and 
PhD dissertations on long reels of black-and-white ﬁ lm that was magniﬁ ed in 
a hood the size of a small doghouse.

Dynabook was tablet size but was targeted primarily at children, 
not as a toy but a tool for learning programming. Kay was an 
Apple fellow during Steve Jobs’s ﬁ rst tenure at the Cupertino 
company so Jobs undoubtedly had intimate knowledge of the 
concept.18
 
 Text messaging includes as a basic feature community-driven 
innovations in spelling and abbreviation. But in about 1850, 
Alfred Vail*—an American co-inventor, with Samuel F. B. Morse, 
of the telegraph—suggested saving words and concealing mes-
sages through the use of agreed-upon code phrases that feel 
strikingly familiar:
shf 
Stocks have fallen
mhii My health is improving
gmlt Give my love to19
 
 Conceiving of music migrating from vinyl or polycarbonate plat-
ters, to bits on a local hard drive, then to an account in the com-
putational cloud seems very current in 2011; Amazon, Google, 
and Apple are working on such programs while Spotify is just 
becoming available in the United States after ﬁ nding success in 
parts of Europe. The idea is not entirely new, however: In 1876, 
music was sent from a centralized location over a telephone wire. 
Both Alexander Graham Bell and his competitor Elisha Gray 
thought the market for person-to-person communication was 
smaller than the chance to bring concert halls to people rather 
than the other way around.
 
 Mark Twain, he of Huckleberry Finn, foretold social  networking. 
In a little-known short story from 1898, he wrote of an inven-
tion called the “telectroscope,” a data-centric extension of the 
then-brand-new telephone system: “The improved ‘limitless- 
distance’ telephone was presently introduced, and the daily 
doings of the globe made visible to everybody, and audi-
bly discussable too, by witnesses separated by any number of 
leagues . . .   day by day, and night by night, he called up one 
corner of the globe after another, and looked upon its life, and 
studied its strange sights, and spoke with its people, and real-
ized that by grace of this marvellous instrument he was almost 
as free as the birds of the air.”20
*Vail’s cousin Theodore became the ﬁ rst president of AT&T and a signiﬁ cant 
ﬁ gure in the history of American business.

Introduction
Themes
For the purposes of understanding the changes that matter for business, 
four broad themes inform this book.
Time and Place
As we will see in multiple contexts, the speed of change is newsworthy. 
Innovation breakthroughs that formerly took decades to reach mass audi-
ences now diffuse in mere months. Some consequences of this extreme 
speed crop up repeatedly, affecting economics, personal life, and the 
competitive business landscape.
Although the Economist’s Frances Cairncross announced “the death of 
distance” back in the 1990s, we continue to see innovations in the deﬁ ni-
tion and redeﬁ nition of place and space. There are times when the square 
meter I occupy on the earth’s surface is decisive or meaningful, and there 
are times when my identity is purely a function of networked bit streams. 
The interesting zone is of course the middle where physical and virtual 
locations interact in often peculiar ways.
Finally, it becomes clear that as the New York Times columnist Thomas 
Friedman has asserted on many occasions,21 globalization and the com-
puting/communications landscape are intertwined. The Internet itself; 
offshoring and the rise of India in particular; the Arab Spring; cyberwar-
fare; Somali piracy; global capital ﬂ ows; complex derivatives and other 
ﬁ nancial instruments; Skype, e-mail, text messaging, and other low-cost 
international communications tools; and long, complex supply chains: All 
of these intermingle globalization and the IT revolution. The year 1989 
marks a convenient start to the modern era, punctuated as it was by the 
fall of the Berlin Wall, Tiananmen Square, and the take-off of cellular tele-
phony. Also in that year, a British computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee 
drafted the proposal that, once implemented beginning in 1991, became 
the World Wide Web. Thus, modern globalization represents a complex 
convergence of technology, geopolitics, and popular expectation.
To take only a few examples of the intersection of globalization and 
technology, consider these:
 
 Global stock exchanges are increasingly correlated.22 Large multination-
als use the same networked accounting software packages and audit 
ﬁ rms, global ﬁ nancial ﬁ rms invest in multiple markets using similar 
algorithms, and markets themselves are better interconnected than ever.
 
 Whether using air freight or container ships, global logistics networks 
rely on substantial and innovative investments in information and 
communications technologies. Real-time package tracking for even

low-value parcels has become the expectation, no matter the origin of 
the shipment. UPS, which moves and tracks 15 million packages per 
day, describes itself as “a technology company that just happens to 
have trucks.”23
 
 While it could be said 20 years ago that half the planet had never 
made a phone call, earth’s overall teledensity—number of telephones 
divided by the number of people, per 100 people—is now greater 
than 100: There are more phones, most of them mobile, than there 
are humans. The poorest and most remote locales, with very few 
exceptions, are getting connected: Even Afghanistan has 41 mobile 
phones for every 100 inhabitants, according to the International 
Telecommunications Union.24
Systems
As a network of networks, the Internet helps enable social and technical 
systems to be connected at low cost and nearly inﬁ nite reach. Accordingly, 
systems thinking is becoming essential: Seeing how  individual and collec-
tive entities interact, and how unexpected side effects can surprise all con-
cerned, has become more important than ever. In part this impact relates 
to the speed with which events can unfold. As more people join various 
facets of the global information grid, formerly separate domains (includ-
ing security, identity, work, and others) now interact, often at a deep level. 
When systems design is good, hardware, software, content, and experience 
converge in a powerfully coherent phenomenon like the iPod. Much more 
often, disconnected entities combine to form dysfunctionally connected 
fragments, as with many government Web sites: “You can’t get here from 
here” often sums up the experience. Mere connection does not a system 
make.
The other primary impact of today’s systems of systems is incredible 
complexity. An old saying borne of frustration goes something like this: 
“To err is human, but to really screw things up requires a computer.” 
Given the intricacy of today’s systems, errors of malice, incompetence, 
or plain bad luck can quickly scale out of control; an example would be 
the Wall Street “ﬂ ash crash” of 2010 in which equities values oscillated 
wildly, driven in part by automated trading algorithms. Complexity com-
promises usability, security, and system performance, yet simpliﬁ cation is 
often difﬁ cult to design in. What some scientists refer to as “emergence”— 
unexpected outcomes of simple, uncoordinated actions—is reaching new 
extremes at the level of the global Internet: Such emergent phenomena as 
the formation of sand dune ridges or bird ﬂ ocking are orders of magnitude 
smaller than global ﬁ nancial or information ﬂ ows, and the science is still 
catching up. It also appears that twentieth-century structures—traditional

Introduction
bureaucracies—cannot manage really large systems, so an important  
aspect of tomorrow’s innovation will be organizational and managerial.
Organizations
As events from Finland (the home of the Angry Birds game, Linux, and 
Nokia), to China, to Egypt testify, the inﬂ uence of the current technol-
ogy toolbox on organizational possibility is signiﬁ cant. In particular, the 
decrease in coordination costs made possible by mobility, social network-
ing, and automated information ﬂ ows is resulting in the emergence of 
new organizational forms. Wikipedia serves as a powerful example: No 
 corporation or think tank or club, the organizational form of the global 
information resource is in fact the wiki, a peer-generated editorial plat-
form. Getting people across time and distance to contribute a lot or a little 
to some larger purpose has never been easier. Two implications of this 
capability relate to risk and strategic possibility.
Speaking of old-style bureaucracies in particular (since it’s too soon 
to see how Linux will age, for example), most every organization pur-
sues self-preservation as a core value. At the same time that new models 
of collaboration and coordination are possible, risks to organizations are 
advancing with frightening speed. Risk changes shape. When ubiquitous 
connection becomes possible, the implications of bad news, threats, and 
honest mistakes can spread blindingly fast. The deﬁ nitions of prudence, 
preparation, and protection are all in transition. Social media enable 
 dispersed people to coordinate responses to perceived danger but also to 
plan crimes, spread rumors, and scam one another.
Time and again, old foundations of strategic thought and action—
including barriers to entry, preservation of proﬁ t margin, building of mar-
ket share, and the pursuit of growth—are being rewritten by new business 
practices, social dynamics, and external forces. What are the beneﬁ ts and 
liabilities of scale, for example, in light of recalibrated coordination costs? 
What are the strategic responses to zero as a practical price point for cer-
tain categories of goods? What constitutes an industry, or a barrier? What 
sector is Amazon really in? eBay took on some capabilities of a bank by 
buying PayPal; Microsoft, after buying Skype and aligning with Nokia, 
now feels something like a phone company.
Perhaps the most important legacy of this revolution will be its facili-
tation of decentralization: In the absence of paper, long time lags in busi-
ness processes, and the imperative for physical colocation, what really is 
the role of a headquarters? If speed in response to volatile markets and 
other conditions is becoming more important than organizational mass, 
can large ﬁ rms adapt quickly enough? Is “too big to fail” more like a 
euphemism for “too big to get out of its own way”?

21
That decentralization can be put to many uses: As longtime Internet 
commentator Clay Shirky points out, the infrastructure is value neutral. 
Thus, the same potential for collaboration outside corporations that drives 
mass efforts to ﬁ nd Steve Fossett’s downed aircraft allows terrorist and 
criminal groups to perform better. They can mount attacks of consider-
able sophistication, as in Mumbai in November 2008, or strike institutions 
responsible for the well-being of many people without leaving meaningful 
evidence. The playing ﬁ eld is more level than in recent memory, but the 
rules of the game and the nature of the players are changing as well.
Workers
As every piece of information, whether a grocery list or a 3D movie, is 
reduced to digital form, able to be inﬁ nitely copied and instantaneously 
moved across the globe, exchanges of economic value are challenging 
idea creators in particular. As it gets harder to get paid to be a musician, 
for example, or a newspaper reporter, some commentators argue that 
quality in those realms is declining.25 So-called user-generated content—
amateur news video, blog posts, Twitter dispatches—alter the role of pro-
fessional news gatherers, pundits, and performers. Every content industry 
faces basic challenges to its twentieth-century existence.
In manufacturing, meanwhile, the increasing role of digitization is rais-
ing the skills required of the workforce. Whether with robotics, enterprise soft-
ware systems, global sourcing and distribution, or increased software content 
of manufactured products (such as refrigerators or garage door openers with 
Internet access), the manufacturing workforce must deliver high levels of 
computer literacy. At a time of high unemployment and increasing wealth 
disparity, the road ahead for people without such skills is not promising.
At the same time, a college education is no longer a guarantee of 
lifetime middle-class status. While some skills, such as nursing, remain 
in high demand, such tasks as bookkeeping and even legal and equity 
research are being shifted to lower-wage locales. Other skills, such as 
engineering and management, can become outdated relatively quickly 
unless people learned how to learn at the time of their primary training. 
While the information revolution pays an education premium, it does not 
do so uniformly or perpetually.
We’ve Seen This Movie Before
Every generation appears to be fond of calling its experiences unprece-
dented. But for all of the amazing statistics compiled over the past 15 years, 
moments of technology disruption and economic transformation are

Introduction
remarkably predictable. Carlota Perez, currently an economic historian at the 
Technological University of Tallinn in Estonia, studied the persistent patterns 
underlying ﬁ ve techno-economic eras. Table 1.1 is adapted from her work.26
Each of these sometimes-overlapping periods has followed a rough 
sequence of four phases: A new technology appears in the market, often 
disrupting existing arrangements. There’s a period of rapid, often silly 
adoption from which a bubble emerges. Bubbles burst; for infotech, that 
happened in 2000. After the speculative excesses burn off, the economic 
potential of the new technology is explored and exploited, pervading 
everyday life. Note that the truly substantial transformations occur after 
the bubble. Once the market matures and the transformative potential is 
largely exhausted, historically a given technology phase is replaced by a 
new technology paradigm.

Such a model puts us squarely in what Perez calls the third, or synergy, 
phase, in which technology change is merely part of the fabric of every-
day life. Bubble valuations are still possible, as Facebook, Groupon, and 
Twitter suggest. But consider the iPad: Nobody can name the processor or 
processor speed, hard drive capacity, recommended software conﬁ guration, 
or most any other standard speciﬁ cation of the PC era. Instead, much like a 
blender whose revolutions per minute are unknown to essentially all con-
sumers, the iPad “just works” to deliver movies, articles, games, weather, 
and other information. Consumer and employee expectations of technology 
are rising accordingly, and devices with poor usability will get harder to sell.
The very power of our computational context is raising the standard 
of execution, however: For the integration of technology to reshape other 
areas, such as health, public safety, and education, will require innova-
tion at a structural level. (The stance of teachers’ unions relative to online 
learning as practiced at Khan Academy is one telling example of a failure 
to innovate.27) That is, Perez’s model of synergy makes sense in terms of 
historical patterns, but both the economic slowdown and the limited areas 
of transformation suggest that much is left to be done before this phase of 
technology diffusion slows down. The good news is that for innovators and 
entrepreneurs, there are a wealth of opportunities to put the information 
revolution to work in the service of customers, investors, and employees.
We turn next to a look at the demographic most at home with the 
new computing and communications landscape, those under 30. To what 
degree will their lives and careers be dominated by the tools that have 
become so much a part of everyday life?

CHAPTER 2
Demographics
The rise of social networking (including social games), smartphones, and text mes-
saging can be attributed in large measure to the behavior of “digital natives” whose 
skills, personas, and expectations have been shaped by a lifetime of exposure to the 
Internet and its accompanying technologies. How these technologies shape people, 
and vice versa, is fascinating to watch, given such a real-life and real-time case study. 
For businesses, employing and selling to this population present particular challenges 
and opportunities.
It would be difﬁ cult, and at any rate artiﬁ cial, to try to argue chickens 
and eggs in questions of demographic change and technological change. 
Given the magnitude of what has happened in the past 20 years, it’s 
appropriate to begin by asking a few questions about radical shifts in who 
is using information technologies and where they are doing so.
A number of commentators have noted how quickly the young pick 
up on such things as electronic games, text messaging, MP3 music, and 
other tools.1 Whether they are called oyayubizoku (“clan of the thumb”) in 
Japan, “digital natives,” or the “net generation,” people currently under 30 
are argued to access, process, and understand information in markedly dif-
ferent ways from their predecessors.2 The implications of this change vary.
For starters, people facile with such tools are changing the workplace. 
Second, in the realm of politics, this group played a decisive role in the 
2008 U.S. elections, utilizing blogs, online video, social networks, and text 
messaging to motivate, communicate, and coordinate. Not long afterward, 
the same tools played a central role in India’s elections. Third, outside of 
work and the civic sphere, that generation is also changing personal rela-
tionships and dating, though as we will see, older people tend to follow suit 
quickly in this regard. Finally, many facets of recreation (with online gam-
ing, fantasy sports leagues, and poker, in particular) play out differently by 
generation. All of these changes will be discussed throughout the book.

Demographics
While we will have much more to say in regard to the world outside 
the OECD* when we discuss mobility in Chapter 27, it’s worth mention-
ing here how mobile phones and data devices are changing entire coun-
tries and, indeed, continents. While in the developed world mobility and 
broadband connections have a wide range of uses, many of them recre-
ational, in India, Africa, and elsewhere, the life-changing aspects of mobile 
telephony tend to be more essential: Is there a market for my catch or 
crop? Is my Haitian daughter alive after the earthquake? Based on this pic-
ture of a tumor or broken limb, how soon must I travel to a doctor? Thus, 
demography is being reshaped by technology: Standards of living and life 
expectancy are projected to improve in ways that dams and other infra-
structure investment have yet to drive.
Is There a “Net Generation”?
The Canadian consultant Don Tapscott has, for well over a decade, been 
focusing attention on what he calls “the net generation.”3 He identiﬁ es 
eight norms to describe people born in the 1980s as they diverge from 
their elders:
 1. Freedom and freedom of choice
 2. Customization
 3. Collaboration
 4. Scrutiny of outsiders
 5. Integrity
 6. Fun, including at school and work
 7. Speed
 8. Innovation
All of these traits are readily evident when one spends time with 
educated, generally afﬂ uent people under 30. To call them a generation, 
however, overreaches the evidence. Tapscott relied on an online survey 
instrument that suffers from considerable self-selection bias: Active net 
users found the survey and proceeded to discuss how actively they used 
and internalized various facets of the net. Based in large measure on the 
behavior of his admittedly talented, bright, and insightful children and

include the U.S., western Europe, and other rich countries. The public health and 
data visualization expert Hans Rosling referred to it as “the country club of the 
United Nations.”

Is There a “Net Generation”? 
27
their friends, Tapscott says in his most recent book in the ongoing study 
that he “came [in 1996] to the conclusion that the deﬁ ning characteristic 
of an entire generation was that they were the ﬁ rst to be ‘growing up 
 digital’”4 (emphasis added).
That statement is problematic for any number of reasons; let’s list ﬁ ve:
 1. Ethnicity. Middle-class white and Asian young people, such as those in 
big-city U.S. and Canadian locales like Tapscott’s Toronto, absolutely 
exhibit some of those eight traits from time to time. They are not, how-
ever, a “generation”: According to the Pew Hispanic Center in 2010, only 
42% of Latinos without a high school degree (that group counts for 42% 
of the total ethnic constituency) go online.5 Given that the U.S. Latin 
population is large, fast growing, and less educated than whites, it can-
not be bundled into Tapscott’s “generation” without qualiﬁ cation.
 2. Heterogeneous online behavior. Just as ofﬂ ine, the online world is 
hardly homogeneous. To connect any two users of various elements 
of the Internet only on that basis makes as much sense as to say that 
everybody who drives, or watches television, is a generation. Danah 
Boyd’s observations on social class differences between Facebook and 
MySpace users are instructive here (and absent from Tapscott’s bibli-
ography).6 Video watchers and ﬁ le-sharing uploaders are at least two 
different species, as are ﬂ ame warriors versus lurkers, or Columbine-
searchers versus Amazon shoppers. Web 2.0—the tendency of user-
powered Web sites such as Flickr and Facebook to build off “civilian” 
energy, and Tapscott’s pole star—is an undeniably powerful force, but 
it is not yet universally embraced by members of any broad demo-
graphic, not even the 20-somethings. Apple, eBay, Amazon, and even 
Google still retain elements of older, content-driven business models 
and are only minimally participatory.
 3. Ethics. As far as “integrity” being a generational attribute, think about 
the business school students at Duke: Ten percent of the class of 
2008 was caught cheating despite honor code posters prominently 
posted in the building and multiple adjustments to the curriculum in 
that direction. A separate study of 54 universities found that 56% of 
MBA students admitted to cheating; how many more cheaters lied?7 
In 2005, dozens of applicants to Harvard Business School tried to 
view acceptance letters before they were mailed by poking around in 
the school’s Web site after a security hole was reported. The school 
denied admission to all 119 net-savvy snoopers.8
 4. Too soon to tell. This cadre is still young. To deﬁ ne a generation, 
before they reach 30, by a set of technology artifacts embraced in dif-
ferent ways to various degrees by only some of them feels  premature 
if nothing else. How many of the Paris/Chicago/Prague 1968

Demographics
generation similarly embraced “fun” or “freedom” as core values back 
in the age of typewriters? Short of World War II, at any time has an 
American generation been deﬁ ned (to the extent that a generation can 
be deﬁ ned) before they reached 30?
 5. Reversing expectations. We’re enduring a prolonged global recession, 
and the results could well consign the ﬁ rst generation in memory, if 
not American history, to economic prospects worse than those of their 
parents.9 According to the 2010 Census, the U.S. poverty level hit 15%. 
Forty percent of people in their 20s live at home at some point.10 That 
is, if the net generation experiences widespread downward social 
mobility, that will be considerably more deﬁ ning than the fact that 
some of them like to blog or watch funny videos at work.
At the same time, any technology change that can drive redesigns 
in something as essential as people’s clothing needs to be noted: Cable-
routing systems for earbud wires are standard in many backpacks, most 
skiwear, and some exercise apparel. Even if Tapscott overstates the size of 
the cadre, millions of people are behaving from a network-centric, digital 
orientation: Facebook organizes their social world, iPods or iPhones their 
music and movies, GPS their travels, and Hulu their television viewing.
Digital Natives
A more nuanced view of the online young comes from John Palfrey and 
Urs Gasser in their book Born Digital. First, unlike Tapscott, they recog-
nize how people in the whole world are online, so they refer to their 
digital natives as a global population rather than a generation.11 The book 
is ﬁ lled with subtle understandings of work, safety, and creativity. A key 
point is made early, in regard to identity: “Digital Natives live much of 
their lives online, without distinguishing between the online and the 
ofﬂ ine. Instead of thinking of their digital identity and their real-space 
identity as separate things, they just have an identity (with representations 
in two, or three, or more different spaces).”12
Digital Natives also treat research as almost exclusively the province 
of Google searches, sometimes with few tools for assessing the quality of 
various results. Physical space can become inconsequential: “Friends” 
of multiple sorts without linguistic differentiation can exist, and move, 
essentially anywhere. Like Tapscott, Palfrey and Gasser demonstrate con-
cern over some people’s data hygiene habits, worrying that offhand utter-
ances, photos, or connections will come back to embarrass, or do worse 
to, the natives’ later adult selves. If stalkers wanted to devise a perfect 
technology for their craft, they could do worse than Facebook.

Millennials at Work

Millennials at Work
A number of consulting ﬁ rms appear to have found a proﬁ table mar-
ket in training white-collar managers to cope with “millennials,” “Gen 
Y,” or whatever one calls these people, who are different in large mea-
sure because of their facility with technology. This divergence in com-
munication tools and styles is already having dramatic effects, according 
to 40- and 50-something peers of mine, particularly in knowledge-driven 
industries such as advertising, accounting, and consulting. Although I fre-
quently see generational differences working with university students, 
from the reports of many colleagues, the sharp differences in communica-
tions platforms across generations are radically complicating the task of 
management. It’s not unheard of for senior executives to have administra-
tive assistants print off their e-mails, and voicemail remains the medium 
of choice in some ﬁ rms. At the other demographic extreme, teens often 
disregard e-mail in favor of some combination of Twitter, text messaging, 
PC-based instant messaging (Google Chat), Skype, and social-network 
message tools.13
It’s too soon to tell what exactly is happening, but a trend in real 
estate appears to be toward tighter quarters. According to the Los Angeles 
Times, the norm in the 1970s for American corporate ofﬁ ce space was 500 
to 700 square feet per employee. The average in 2010 was just over 200 
square feet per person, and the space allocation could fall to as little as 
50 square feet by 2015, according to Peter Miscovich, a real estate broker 
at Jones Lang LaSalle.14 Part of this can of course be attributed to expense 
control, but teams in some industries are growing closer and more collab-
orative; some people like closer proximity to coworkers. Finally, laptops, 
videoconferencing, and mobile phones mean that desks no longer serve 
the same function they formerly did.
In addition, people who grew up with a Web-centric social sensibility 
often communicate rather more freely than their elders (or regulators, in 
some cases) would prefer. The enterprise information services (IS) organi-
zation has the unenviable task of logging all material communications, and 
sometimes of turning off some of the most powerful Web 2.0 exemplars. 
The aforementioned middle-age managers, meanwhile, must communicate 
across an increasingly wide variety of technologies, each with particulari-
ties of convenience, cultural norms, interoperability, and security and pri-
vacy. Add to this cultural dynamic the technical incompatibilities among 
communications tools. It feels a bit like the 1980s days of the CompuServe 
versus Prodigy online services: My Facebook message won’t cross over to 
your LinkedIn proﬁ le.
The locus of work will be addressed later, but for now we can note 
that both managers and managed are still adjusting to expectations of a

Demographics
seven-day, 24-hour workweek, made possible by BlackBerries, PCs, and 
the like. The workplace is increasingly located wherever the person 
and his or her tools are. The fact that the tools are always on and used for 
both work and private tasks, and are both personal and invisibly intimate 
has implications for relationships, for personal health and well-being, and 
for the basic employment contract, both speciﬁ ed and implied.
Behavior and Expectations
Several behavioral dynamics of the digital natives are pertinent. First, the 
ease of online collaboration and interaction has lowered coordination costs: 
Organizing a group of 3 or of 3,000 has never been easier.15 If the underly-
ing assumption is that because people are reachable, they can be counted 
on, they will be repeatedly invited to contribute in some way to a project 
they care about. Mobilizing people, whether for a party or a cause, is now 
primarily a matter of desire, not logistical hurdles. Text-based interactions 
are so comfortable that the line between friend, acquaintance, and stranger 
becomes easily blurred. Digital privacy and trust are very much in ﬂ ux.
Second, speed matters. Having to wait on a modem-grade connection 
causes nearly physical pain, as witnessed by the public outrage toward 
AT&T for poor iPhone connections. Multitasking is common, to the point 
where the need to prohibit texting and driving is motivating legislation in 
many states. The speed of change is very real to the digital natives. Within 
a single family, for example, the ages at which children get mobile phones 
or Facebook accounts will invariably drop as younger siblings come of age.
Looking Ahead
Technology is driving in the young (and now young adults) new under-
standings and expectations of time, of intimacy, of productivity, of prop-
erty rights, of work, of location, and of choice. Laws and norms are slow 
to adapt, but change is under way in these domains as well. Any institu-
tion one can name—from public schools and libraries to bars and clubs 
to policing—must react. Much of what follows in this book will be read 
very differently by a 20-year-old as compared to his or her parent, wher-
ever each may live. The point is not to catalog the ways this population is 
 different—that has been capably done elsewhere—but rather to highlight 
the particular ways that demography is driving sociotechnical change. At the 
same time, the converse is true: The generation with the longest to live in 
the aftermath of the global recession is also the one with potentially the 
most powerful set of tools for living that have ever been developed.

Looking Ahead 
31
When Millennials Come to Work
Many 20-something new hires come to corporate workplaces immersed 
in technology only to ﬁ nd themselves frustrated by the seemingly arbi-
trary and archaic rules governing the use of computing on the job. Four 
areas appear to be particular stress points:
 1. Millennials are mobile; enterprises are ﬁ xed. Having lived on lap-
tops, iPods, and smartphones from a young age, 20-somethings 
frequently are stymied by the 8:00-to-5:00 precepts of many 
organizations. Flexible working hours, working from home, and 
enterprise support for smartphones and tablets are the expec-
tation, yet all three can be blocked by rules, infrastructure, and 
custom. Voicemail might be a foreign concept, particularly if it 
cannot be forwarded to the device and platform of choice.
In response, change is happening one company and one 
manager at a time. In particular, some IS organizations are exper-
imenting with ﬂ exible architectures that allow employees to bring 
whatever edge device they see ﬁ t to the corporate system. This 
notion of “bring your own device” (BYOD) challenges security 
practices, to be sure, but, done right, can build workplace morale 
and allows sales forces, in particular, to push the envelope with 
technologies (such as tablets in particular) that increase customer 
involvement. At the same time, given the speed of technology 
change, BYOD does not rely on the organization to pick winners 
in turbulent markets.
 2. Enterprise systems are hard to learn. Customer relationship man-
agement software, big enterprise packages such as SAP and 
Oracle, and custom applications built in-house can all be daunt-
ing to understand and typically are not particularly user-friendly 
at the interface layer. Once people master the systems, they often 
perform with a certain level of disappointment inherent in the 
experience. For people used to instantaneous responses from a 
Google search, sensory involvement with a console game, or full 
Facebook functionality on a smartphone, the real-world strengths 
and weaknesses of enterprise software can be intensely frustrat-
ing. The fact that enterprise systems usually run only on desktops 
rather than on mobile platforms can compound the alienation.
Some organizations are experimenting with mentors who infor-
mally teach new recruits both the cultural norms of the  company

and the tricks of the trade in terms of taming the beast that is enter-
prise software. For their part, software vendors and systems inte-
grators are consciously trying to improve usability, sometimes by 
incorporating gaming elements in software design. Support for 
mobile platforms is a front-burner priority across the industry.
 3. For millennials, software is social. A particular ﬂ ashpoint often 
relates to the use of Facebook on company time. Many ﬁ rms 
block the service at the ﬁ rewall, which simply drives the behav-
ior to the smartphone; in most cases even prisons cannot inter-
fere with the cellular signal. The reality is that social networking 
can be an enormous waste of time, and managers’ concern 
about lost productivity has roots in fact. At the same time, more 
and more companies are encouraging social behavior in work-
ing environments, whether in marketing teams that use online 
chat for customer interaction, collaborative spaces in forecast-
ing or research and development, or efforts to judge market 
sentiment on the basis of macro-level social data in the form of 
Facebook “likes” or Twitter mentions. Millennials’ native comfort 
with social software can be leveraged for corporate beneﬁ t in 
many such deployments. In the ﬁ nal analysis, however, it’s still 
a balancing act for employees not to abuse the window on the 
outside world at the same time that managers set expectations 
and trust employees to manage their time, networks, and assets 
responsibly.
 4. Self-service trumps formal training. Many 20-somethings are quite 
adept with many technologies: video editing, complex game con-
soles, wireless networking, distributed storage, music mixes, and 
so on. When they encounter technology roadblocks on the job, 
many prefer to try to troubleshoot the issue themselves rather 
than wait in the queue of trouble tickets being addressed by the 
IS group. Of course, the downside of such behavior is the poten-
tial for making the situation worse. The thought of sitting through 
corporate technology training, meanwhile, can be depressing, 
especially when the same manager who required the training asks 
the new hire for help setting up a ringtone or ﬁ xing the printer.
One promising development is in text-based technical sup-
port, which has the beneﬁ t of being able to be done remotely 
(potentially in India) and utilizing the employee’s mobile phone 
rather than the compromised PC under repair. It also allows the 
conversation to occur in the 20-somethings’ native environment 
while allowing tech support to multitask.

CHAPTER 3
Behavioral Economics
Why do people do what they do? In the twentieth-century West, neoclassical eco-
nomics asserted that rational people want more of most things and will act to achieve 
this goal. The assumption is embedded in virtually every economics course taught 
in western universities and operationalized from there onward. One implication of 
said rationality is that one way to motivate people is to promise them more of some-
thing (typically money) in return for more of a desired behavior. Both the bonus cul-
ture of Wall Street, so much in the news after 2008, and the debate over competing 
views of chief executive compensation silently embed this set of  assumptions. In the 
 laboratory and in the wild, however, people don’t actually do the rational thing all that 
often. The discovery of reliable behavioral patterns that defy neoclassical rationality 
aligns closely with a broad range of technology-related phenomena.
Challenges to Economic Man
Beginning in the 1960s, psychologists and economists began to employ 
theories of human motivation to explain certain decisions and other eco-
nomic actions. Previously, market behavior had been theorized in neo-
classical economics to be the outcome of a) rational actors b) who have 
identiﬁ ed preferences that can be associated with a value c) acting inde-
pendently with access to full and relevant information d) to improve their 
utility as individuals or proﬁ ts as ﬁ rms.1 Economic man turns out to be 
more complex than was previously thought, however, and sometimes he  
goes missing entirely.
Rational actors are hard to ﬁ nd; all of us employ “irrational” tools to 
make decisions. Many factors go into our preferences, not all of them

Behavioral Economics
conscious and many of them not clearly valued. Information about our 
options is rarely full and even more rarely perfect. Finally, we act for 
many reasons, not only to maximize our utility.
First, people internalize “irrational” elements (such as past experience, 
rules of thumb, and verbal framing mechanisms, such as the recited order 
of a list) as they make choices. The myth of “the hot hand” in basketball, 
for example, was debunked in 1985: Making a shot changes the  player’s 
prediction of the next shot’s success but not the actual chances of its 
going in. In short, we frequently see patterns where there are none.2 This 
inﬂ uence can be quite subtle: Experimental subjects who are asked the 
last digits of their social security number then go on to use those random 
numbers to “anchor” an unrelated operation, such as a bid on a product 
or a guess on an obscure fact.3 In technical terms, people can reliably be 
found to hold biases and employ rules of thumb while making choices.
Second, the neoclassical assumptions regarding preferences have been 
tested in many ways. Daniel Kahneman, a coauthor (with the late Amos 
Tversky) of some seminal papers in the ﬁ eld, won the 2002 Nobel Prize 
in economics “for having integrated insights from psychological research 
into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision- 
making under uncertainty.”4 A few years later, the then–University of 
Chicago legal scholar Cass Sunstein wrote a book with longtime behav-
ioral economist Richard Thaler called Nudge, on “choice architectures”: 
The structure in which choices are presented to people changes what 
they choose.5 Sunstein is currently working in the Obama administration. 
Other mainstream authors include Duke’s Dan Ariely, whose Predictably 
Irrational includes a chapter on the power of “free” or apparently free 
prices that reliably lead people to make “irrational” choices.6
Third, imperfect information, which had long been acknowledged, 
was found to come in many forms, with many outcomes. In a classic 
paper, George Akerlof showed how the market for used cars was shaped 
by buyers’ overwhelming perception that sellers generally intended to 
hide defects: Information asymmetry can have the effect of crippling entire 
categories of transactions. It is a case of “all other things being equal” not 
holding true, and people behaving accordingly.7
Finally, empirical experiments and theoretical constructs found people 
valued fairness rather than maximizing their utility at the cost of another, 
visible human. Here’s a deft telling of a landmark experiment from George 
Mason University’s Center for the Study of Neuroeconomics:
Take two people and tell them they have the opportunity to split 
$10. Furthermore, tell one person that, as ﬁ rst mover, they get to 
make a one time offer, and tell the other person that, as second 
mover, they get the opportunity to either accept or reject this offer.

37
If the offer is rejected they both go home with zero. This stylized 
negotiation was ﬁ rst studied by experimental economists in
[a 1982 paper] and economists got a surprise. Game theory predicts 
an unequal split favoring the person who gets to make the offer. 
After all if I offer a ($9, $1) split where you only get $1 you should 
take it since a dollar is better than nothing, but instead a majority 
of the offers are to split equally.8
As Clay Shirky, currently a professor of media studies at New York 
University, noted, “[P]eople behave [in the experiment] as if their rela-
tionship matters, even when they are told it doesn’t.”9 Fairness does not 
square with the maximization assumptions so common before the turn of 
the twenty-ﬁ rst century.
Not only in matters of fairness but also in the realm of motivation, 
people maximize things other than economic utility. Repeated and well-
designed studies have found cognitive tasks have intrinsic satisfactions, so 
much so that people actually do worse at brainstorming and other jobs 
when incentives are raised. Instead, for brain work, extensive research 
suggests people are rewarded with three intangibles:
 1. Mastery. Getting better at something difﬁ cult (whether golf, coding, or 
a foreign language) for the sake of being able to do it better, or well.
 2. Autonomy. People who solve hard problems (and lots of other peo-
ple as well) want to be left alone in the process of doing so. The 
rise of professionalism in law and medicine relates directly to this 
motivation.10
 3. Purpose. Working in the pursuit of some purpose larger than the self 
and beyond the paycheck is coming to the fore for many students 
entering the workforce. Some ﬁ rms, such as Zappos and Deloitte, are 
capitalizing on this desire in their recruiting by emphasizing nonmon-
etary rewards, such as an authentic ﬁ rm mission or explicit ways of 
“giving back.”11
Behavioral Economics in a Networked Age
What is the place of behavioral economics in the landscape of informa-
tion technology? First of all, as work can be accomplished outside ﬁ rms 
because of the power of self-organization, some scholars have invoked the 
lessons of behavioral economics to explain the behavior of people who 
contribute, without monetary compensation, to such formidable efforts as 
Linux or Wikipedia. In the former case, roughly 8,000  programmer-years 
were estimated to be invested as of 2001;12 Wikipedia has nearly

500 million edits. The lack of monetary pay is an existence case, not a 
hypothetical, and both examples operate at a large enough scale that moti-
vation must be explained somehow. Mastery, autonomy, and purpose do 
that job quite well, it would appear.
Second, the behavior exhibited by participants in large-scale social 
networks (such as Facebook, but also online games) is showing extensive 
investment of both play and work time for no apparent (external) reward. 
Behavioral “locks and keys,” as game developer Jesse Schell put it,13 are at 
work all around the technology landscape:
 
 When DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the 
Department of Defense research and development group behind 
the Internet) wanted to celebrate the Internet’s fortieth birthday in 
2009, they conducted a fascinating experiment. Ten red weather 
balloons were tethered in plain view in different U.S. locations, 
and the ﬁ rst team to submit the correct coordinates of all 10 won 
$40,000. MIT’s team won, in large measure because they devised a 
clever incentive model to grow the network of observers: The $4,000 
per balloon was divided between referring parties and the observer 
him- or herself, leading to increased participation. Other fascinat-
ing developments included the spooﬁ ng of competing teams with 
Photoshopped fake balloons. Open networks, operating on Twitter 
for instance, performed quite well.14
 
 Why do people watch different movies in the streamed Netﬂ ix than they 
put into their queues of mailed DVDs? In part, it’s because people are 
aspirational: In the future, the logic goes, I really should watch some-
thing redeeming. When Friday comes, however, the lowbrow option 
wins out and Schindler’s List stays in the envelope. Given that every 
streaming decision is made in the moment, the aspirations disappear.15
 
 Online dating is clearly a huge business, but the rules of engagement 
are still being sorted out. The desire to attract appealing candidates 
with one’s description leads to the temptation to lie. Researchers at 
Cornell and Michigan State looked at daters’ actual height, weight, and 
age, then compared those to online representations.16 Unlike purely 
virtual environments, online dating ideally leads to face-to-face meet-
ing, so the ability to lie is tempered by the possibility of real-world 
conﬁ rmation. Men lied about height and, infrequently, about age more 
than women did, while both sexes lied almost equally, and in the 
majority of cases, about weight. As the researchers concluded, “The 
pattern of the deceptions, frequent but slight, suggests that deception 
on online dating proﬁ les is strategic. Participants balanced the ten-
sion between appearing as attractive as possible while also being per-
ceived as honest.”

Behavioral Economics in a Networked Age 
39
 
 In life and technology broadly considered, the power of default set-
tings is coming to be more fully understood. Facebook’s default 
privacy settings, for example, are most favorable to Facebook, not 
the person joining the service. Google tracks an individual’s search 
history unless she turns off the setting deep in a complex menu of 
choices. So-called opt-out versus opt-in defaults are only one exam-
ple: audible notiﬁ cations, color schemes, units of measurement, and 
countless other options are extremely frequently left on the “factory” 
settings. Given this inertia, the noted technology commentator Kevin 
Kelly has noted how much the power lies in the hands of those who 
set the defaults.17
 
 Behavioral economics has many insights to contribute to this domain. 
stickK.com was founded by three Yale professors who saw the appli-
cation of behavioral economics to personal aspiration. The model is 
simple: People select a goal, set the stakes, get a referee, and build a 
network of friends for moral support. Whether for weight loss, smok-
ing cessation, or dissertation writing, there is evidence to suggest 
small, symbolically powerful incentives affect behavior much more 
than substantial ﬁ nancial rewards.
 
 Symbolic rewards, paradoxically, can get people to spend real money. 
The business models of many online games feature large inﬂ ows of 
revenue for upgraded game elements (swords, shields, real estate). 
Disney’s Club Penguin gives away game points but charges $6 per 
month for players to redeem the points.
 
 Foursquare was one of the hot companies at the SXSW culture and 
technology gathering in 2010, following Twitter’s breakout there a 
few years earlier. In Foursquare, people “check in” to the real-world 
places they visit via mobile phone, announcing their presence to 
friends and proprietor alike. It turns out you can check in to a place 
you are not visiting: To make a point, one man became mayor (one of 
Foursquare’s honorary titles) of the North Pole. Foursquare’s founder 
replied to that effort in a blog comment by asking “We often won-
der why people ‘cheat’ when there’s really nothing to win—it’s not 
like we’re giving away trips to Hawaii or Ford Fiestas over here. But 
I guess the combo of mayorships, local recognition and, hey, maybe 
a free slice of pizza is a little too much for some people to live 
without.”18
 
 Facebook games like FarmVille, with extremely limited graphics 
and plotlines, contrast vividly with PlayStation 3 titles with massive 
visual horsepower but steep learning curves. In addition, FarmVille 
invites investment of time and attention, which creates a form of 
lock-in. (Leaderboards at console game sites perform a similar func-
tion.) Females especially appear to be gravitating to Facebook games

because of the social aspect rather than a skills challenge, and they 
previously helped drive the Wii to the top of console market share; 
Microsoft and Sony are responding by mimicking Nintendo’s sim-
ple but gesture-driven platform. The shift hit home hard at game 
ﬁ rm Electronic Arts, which bought a social network game company 
(Playﬁ sh) for $275 million in cash the same day that the ﬁ rm laid off 
1,500 console-supporting employees.
Looking Ahead
Several tendencies appear to be emerging. First, the barrier between real 
life and play life can get fuzzy. In 2008, two Dutch youths were con-
victed of stealing virtual goods from an online gamer by beating him up 
at school and coercing him into transferring the goods. A Chinese gamer 
was murdered over the sale of an online sword artifact. The Wii bowler 
uses a real arm motion to hurl a virtual ball toward virtual pins. People’s 
FarmVille opponents are their real-world friends. In addition, people are 
powerfully motivated by symbols, just as they are elsewhere, whether 
those artifacts are military service ribbons, ﬂ ags, or luxury cars. Finally, as 
always, people work assiduously to game every system, whether of grades 
or Facebook friend counts or stickK weight-loss programs. Leaderboards 
matter, whether of ﬁ nancial accumulation, imaginary milestones, or ath-
letic performances, and with competition invariably comes a testing of the 
limits of the contest.
Given that people can work and connect from anywhere, and that 
fewer and fewer jobs rely on ﬁ xed physical infrastructure, corporations 
are no longer the assumed unit of organization. As groups grow easier to 
form, they can accomplish many kinds of work, and a key consideration 
in pursuit of a goal becomes motivating the right people rather than form-
ing the organization. Money is no longer assumed to be the only way to 
drive behavior, especially cognitive effort, so new kinds of organizations 
are challenging the primacy of companies, schools and universities, and 
traditional non-proﬁ ts, as we will see in Chapters 9 and 11.
Both the degree of portability and the global scale are new here: Ten 
years ago, no one could play Scrabble with hundreds of people while sit-
ting on a bus. Now that we can, what comes next? With so many games 
now resident in the computational cloud, how will people remember 
or re-create them in the future? How will human relationships, whether 
intense or trivial, scale in these virtually physical or physically virtual set-
tings particularly?
Finally, how will other systems, currently driven by other incentive 
programs, be transformed by the permeation of game and other group

dynamics? Schell points to education as an obvious target, but corporate 
human resources, aging, personal ﬁ tness, and retirement savings are just 
as likely. As a result, nearly every ﬁ eld of endeavor could be affected by 
the clever application of behavioral carrots and sticks via new electronic 
media. Social engineering, in short, appears to be supplanting—or at any 
rate joining—technical engineering in the vanguard of innovation.

CHAPTER 4
Information Economics
In the late 1990s, there was talk of a new economy in which old rules like supply 
and demand no longer applied; key aspects of the economy would be characterized 
by abundance, by the problems that come from having to allocate surplus.1 As we all 
know, whether with iron ore, rice, or water, those scenarios did not come to pass; 
“too much” is seldom the problem. Throughout the hype, traditionalists held the line: 
“Durable economic principles can guide you in today’s frenetic business environment. 
Technology changes. Economic laws do not.”2 Information goods include encyclope-
dias, compact discs, cell phone minutes, or equity analysis, all of which are valued 
not by what they are but what they convey. The characteristics involved in informa-
tion economics—particularly network effects, lock-in, and pricing behavior—underlie 
many of the phenomena in this book.
Very few private-sector companies have chief economists. Investment 
banks, publicly traded homebuilders, and large healthcare ﬁ rms all might 
have need for such a position, but generally few companies hire such 
individuals. In 1998, two economists from the University of California at 
Berkeley published Information Rules,3 a neoclassical approach to such 
issues as technology lock-in (why does everyone still use the demon-
strably inferior QWERTY keyboard?), information pricing, and standards 
wars. Unless otherwise noted, all foundation concepts and some examples 
noted here come from this source.
In 2002, one of the authors, Hal Varian, began consulting at Google. 
Shortly thereafter, he took a leave of absence (and eventually retired) from 
his academic post, moving full time to become Google’s chief economist. 
In that position, Varian’s tenure has coincided with the rapid growth of 
Google’s breakthrough AdWords/AdSense pricing mechanism—which 
is based on complex auction mechanics—as well as the ﬁ rm’s foray into

bidding on wireless spectrum.4 Google has begun to lobby world govern-
ments and enter often-complicated agreements with competitors and other 
entities (in regard to mobile phones or book publishing for two exam-
ples). At both the macro/policy and micro/strategy levels, information eco-
nomics is sufﬁ ciently nonintuitive and, at Google’s scale, so complex that 
having such expertise in-house appears to have been well worth the hire.
Information Goods
Goods whose primary value lies in the information they convey (rather 
than in their physical essence, as with wheat, or their functional use, such 
as a comb) can behave in unexpected ways. Classic examples of informa-
tion goods include books, newspapers, stock tickers, and movies/DVDs. 
The peculiar properties of digital information goods combined with the 
nature of the Internet and related technologies have led to upheaval in 
some old industries. In brief, four behaviors of information goods have 
become relevant in music, news, software, ﬁ nancial analysis, and other 
sectors, often changing business models or economic viability in the pro-
cess. These four behaviors are:
 1. Sampling
 2. First-copy costs
 3. Price based on value, not cost
 4. Network effects
Sampling
Information goods are experienced and thus need somehow to be sam-
pled before deciding to buy.
The only way to know whether you like a song or movie is to “consume” 
the information before purchase. Trailers serve this purpose for movies; radio 
airplay was perfect sampling for recorded music. Third parties become impor-
tant: Word of mouth, about which we will hear more later, and reviewers are 
important pieces of the puzzle. Compare news to a car, in which statistics, 
crash-test results, and other metrics can guide customer choices. Information 
goods, in other words, cannot easily be understood through standardized rep-
resentations or objective measurements: Knowing how many actors (or jokes) 
were in Airplane tells the viewer nothing. Counting pages for a book is simi-
larly worthless.
Reputation, whether conveyed by brand, word of mouth, or other-
wise, helps overcome the sampling problem. People buy the Wall Street 
Journal a year at a time not because they looked at every day’s edition

before they bought it but because past performance suggests they will 
beneﬁ t from the kinds of information that will be delivered.
First-Copy Costs
Information goods are expensive to produce and very inexpensive to 
reproduce and, over the Internet, to distribute.
The shorthand way of saying this relates to commercial software: The 
ﬁ rst copy of Windows 7 cost billions of dollars in research and develop-
ment costs, advertising, and testing. The second copy cost under a  dollar 
if physical media are involved, more with logistics costs; for online down-
loads with essentially free distribution, that second-copy cost drops toward 
zero. With newspapers, it’s a similar model, except that timely physical 
distribution at scale can be very expensive, particularly as the prices of 
electricity, ink, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks all typically rise with the 
cost of crude oil.
Price Based on Value, Not Cost
Because replication and distribution costs for the copies after the original 
are essentially zero online, the price of information goods is not based on 
cost but on the value attached to the good by individual customers.
Supply and demand curves multiply: At the extreme, there are as many 
optimal prices as there are people with value preferences. One important 
task, then, is to ﬁ nd ways to differentiate the product and capture as much 
of the market’s price tolerance as possible. Economists call this price dis-
crimination, and it is often illegal and usually unpopular. What businesses 
can do is to offer subtle variations on the basic offering. In addition, con-
sumers have become accustomed to free being a viable price for many 
information goods.
Network Effects
Externalities (outcomes of trade not accounted for in the transaction) 
are frequently negative: Trafﬁ c and pollution can be used as examples. 
Network externalities, also called network effects,5 can also be positive: 
The behavior of someone else in the network makes me better off without 
my doing anything. Flu shots are a positive network externality: The more 
people in my ofﬁ ce who get inoculations, the lower my risk of exposure 
in that sphere of my life. If someone else signs up with my cellular carrier, 
in-network calls and texts to that subscriber are often free. If more people 
buy Word after I do, the odds of being able to exchange documents are 
better the more people are on the platform.

Information Economics
Pricing Information: Versioning and Bundling
Unlike most examples in commercial history, free is a viable price point for 
digital information goods: Linux is a classic example. Subsidies are often 
common: Advertisers provide a revenue stream so newspaper  readers, 
television viewers, and Google searchers can enjoy lower priced or no-
cost media. Other revenue streams are possible: Some bands allow tap-
ing of concerts to increase fan loyalty or to encourage the sale of T-shirts, 
 commercial-quality recordings, or future concert tickets. (See “Software 
Copying” later in the chapter.)
Pricing information goods to extract as much proﬁ t as possible from 
this cacophony of demand curves, and often in networked scenarios, is 
a fascinating exercise. In particular, the notion of “versioning” is very 
appealing. This practice relates to the ways that producers can reconﬁ g-
ure information goods so as to present different market segments with 
attractively priced versions of the same core product. Basic and deluxe 
versions of software are frequently very similar under the hood, but the 
“professional” features included in the platinum version allow the seller 
to extract premium prices from people who value the good more highly.
Movies are a convenient example. Depending on one’s personal pref-
erences, a customer can watch a movie in dozens of ways, each with its 
own set of costs and beneﬁ ts, starting with time from original release:
 
 Opening-night premiere in Hollywood: thousands of dollars if at all 
available
 
 Opening week, New York, Friday evening: $20 per seat
 
 Opening week, Topeka, afternoon matinee: $5 per seat
 
 IMAX 3D version: $25 per seat
 
 Second-run theater: $1 with coupon
 
 Comcast pay-per-view: $5 for a roomful of viewers
 
 Hotel pay-per-view: $13.95
 
 Pirated copy of DVD in China: $0.25
 
 Over-the-air free TV two years after release: commercial interruption
 
 Netﬂ ix: physical DVD rental price varies by plan and activity level
 
 Director’s cut Blu-ray disc with commentary, bloopers, and other 
extras: $40
For movies, the multitude of distribution and delivery channels makes 
versioning extremely effective: Blockbuster hits like Avatar stay in theaters 
as long as they can command an audience while duds are pulled after 
a week or go straight to cable television and/or DVD. Few other offer-
ings can exploit so much of an audience’s willingness to spend, although

Pricing Information: Versioning and Bundling 
47
until the ascendency of the Kindle, hardcover books also had longer runs 
before the paperback release if they sold well.
Versioning can be based on attributes of the good: Higher-quality 
(Blu-ray versus VHS), better documentation, extra content such as direc-
tors’ commentaries on DVDs, access to relevant archives and data sets, 
real-time stock quotes versus 20-second delayed. Versioning can also 
create multiple pricing options based on characteristics of the buyer: stu-
dent discounts, group pricing, or differential pricing by geography.
This practice can backﬁ re, as when Lexicon, a high-end home theater 
company, repackaged an inexpensive Blu-ray player inside a fancier case 
and tried to charge a 600% premium.6 The attributes of a more expensive 
version (whether in a Lexus compared to a Toyota or in a software pack-
age or online dating service) need at once to deliver perceptible value 
to some segment of the customer base and leverage the investment in 
the base platform. As customers get savvier and share observations online, 
maintaining the value perception for the different versions can be difﬁ cult, 
as Lexicon discovered.
Based on some classic observations of human behavior, the Infor-
mation Rules authors recommend adding a third, extremely expensive ver-
sion of many products that will sell very few copies. The reason for this is 
the anecdotally familiar notion of extremeness aversion: The best- selling 
wine in most restaurants is the second cheapest, and buyers typically ﬁ nd 
comfort in medium sizes, intermediate variants, and other middle options. 
Having a “diamond” version with extra-special tech support or another 
apparently worthwhile attribute makes the formerly most expensive 
“deluxe” version look like prudent middle ground.
Another practice related to addressing the many demand curves for 
an information good is bundling. While travel presents a classic example 
in the cruise plus airfare plus hotel plus on-ship amenity credit for a single 
price, many information goods are bundled:
 
 Newspapers are bundled by content (sports, entertainment, news, 
food, classiﬁ ed ads, etc.) and by time: Subscriptions are temporal bun-
dles. As we will see, both of these bundles are being disaggregated by 
the Internet, with signiﬁ cant implications for news gatherers, citizens, 
and investors.
 
 Software is bundled; ofﬁ ce software with a word processor, spread-
sheet, presentation graphics, and potentially other elements is the 
 typical product.
 
 Cable television service is bundled, not only in service tiers with 
access to different groups of channels but also in “triple plays” of TV, 
Internet, and wired telephony.

Information Economics
 
 Encyclopaedia Britannica was a classic bundled offer, including thou-
sands of entries that the owner would never read.
 
 Music used to be sold in bundles called albums. Once ﬁ le-sharing 
and, later, legal download services made it possible to obtain single 
songs, the music industry faced the same issues as the news sector. 
By contrast, few people want only “the best” ﬁ ve minutes of a movie 
or television show: Dramas and comedies and documentaries do not 
unbundle in the same way as music. A TV series is a bundle of epi-
sodes, but a movie is not a bundle of scenes.
Network Effects
Physical goods can exhibit network effects: Owning a Lotus sports car in 
an isolated region is made difﬁ cult by the lack of trained mechanics, spare 
parts, or a liquid secondary market for buying and selling these unusual 
cars. Compare Lotus to Toyota: The more people who own Toyotas in a 
given geography, the more options an owner has for service. As demand 
expands, additional dealers move in, providing opportunities for compari-
son shopping and potentially better service in the presence of competition.
Information goods exhibit many network effects beyond the ﬁ le-
sharing compatibility noted earlier. The English language is an informa-
tion good with strong network effects, for example: The more people who 
learn it, the more communications options English speakers have and the 
easier global travel becomes. VHS versus Betamax and HD-DVD versus 
Blu-Ray illustrate how standards wars between competing technical sys-
tems (and potentially business models), are, at base, stories of network 
effects. Buyers did not want to own a soon-to-be-obsolete video player/
recorder, in part because of the poor selection of prerecorded titles for the 
losing ecosystem.
Electronic games are perfect examples of network effects. This applies 
to game platforms (Xbox, Wii, PlayStation) as well as online games and 
online social networks: As more people ﬂ ock to a platform, the more 
valuable and attractive it becomes compared to competing alternatives. 
Online dating is full of network externalities: The more people who sign 
up, the better tuned the matching algorithms and the better the selection 
of potential partners.
The fax machine is a commonly cited example: The ﬁ rst fax machine 
on earth could have cost $1 million, been gold-plated and encrusted in 
diamonds, but it would have been worthless for lack of partners. As the 
technology took hold, every time another fax machine was sold any-
where in the world, the option value of any existing machine rose by a

small amount.7 The same pattern of thought can be applied to Facebook, 
LinkedIn, and other social networking services. It is not clear that net-
work effects do not have a ceiling, however: The 2 billionth Facebook 
user might not be as valuable as the 100 millionth.*
As the fax became available in ofﬁ ces all over the world, its network 
effect helped drive another phenomenon: positive feedback. Because of 
the importance of standards, deﬁ ned both by market success (Microsoft 
Windows) and industry committees (IEEE† 802.11 or Wi-Fi), success in a 
technology can often build future success. The same holds true for gam-
ing platforms: I can’t play against you if our controllers and software 
don’t agree. With GPS units, in contrast, brand proliferation is a possibil-
ity because of weak network effects: Your unit and my unit have little 
to do with each other. In some situations, search potentially being one, 
strong positive feedback leads to winner-take-all markets, or markets with 
a very small number of entrants protected by high barriers to entry.
Technical standards play a critical role in information economics. The 
choice of mobile phone standard for a given geography involved billions 
of dollars in revenue for the suppliers as well as intense frustration when 
a Verizon CDMA‡ phone from Louisville would not work in London or 
Lisbon. Railroad gauges (nonconforming geographies quickly got iso-
lated), alternating current power supply (electric plugs in the United 
Kingdom are still not uniform), and the locking device used in container 
shipping8 (a truly transformative, if invisible, technology standard that 
helped enable globalization) provide other examples of the long-lasting 
importance of winning standards battles.
Lock-in
The technology phenomenon known as lock-in can be related to both 
network effects and winner-take-all positive feedback. As a compari-
son, consider an automobile. I can drive a Dodge and you a Toyota, but 
* But as my colleague John Parkinson points out, Facebook’s 2 billionth member is 
the ﬁ fth person in some individual’s social graph. Networks with power-law char-
acteristics (see Chapter 6) behave in strange ways.
† Pronounced “Eye-triple-E”, the IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers, a global professional body responsible for, among other things, many 
technical standards in computing and communications.
‡ For a time the predominant set of cell phone standards used in the United States, 
but rarely elsewhere, where GSM (Global System for Mobile) dominated. CDMA is 
shorthand for both CDMAOne and CDMA2000 technologies.

Information Economics
those choices are generally independent. If we were to switch vehicles 
for whatever reason, I would have access to the same roads and destina-
tions, my driving skills would transfer quickly (except perhaps my ability 
to ﬁ nd the windshield wiper or headlight controls), and the experience 
would be generally unremarkable: Switching costs between cars, while 
not zero—my ﬂ oor mats and snow tires might not ﬁ t the new vehicle—
are extremely low.
Now consider software. At the personal level, your documents from 
Pages on the Mac should be read by my copy of Word on an HP PC. 
There might be some hiccups, but Mac–PC compatibility is reasonably 
high (even though that has not always been true). At the enterprise level, 
things get more complicated: Switching software can be a $100 million 
proposition as data stored to support billing in Oracle, for example, would 
likely not be ready to support sales force management in SAP. Users 
trained on one system face long and sometimes difﬁ cult transitions to new 
software and, sometimes, hardware. Investments in computing hardware, 
networking equipment, and other infrastructure may or may not be able 
to support a short-notice switchover.
Switching costs are part of lock-in, but there are other aspects as well. 
Just as Gillette blades won’t ﬁ t Schick razors, neither will Dell printer car-
tridges ﬁ t a Xerox unit. Uniqueness in consumables and other modules 
(ink, video game cartridges, batteries) can impose switching costs or oth-
erwise lock a customer to a product. Training, support, documentation, 
and other “soft” elements of a system can enforce lock-in; contracts are 
still another vehicle to achieve the same objective.
Closely related to lock-in (keeping a customer a customer) is lock-
out: preventing a competitor from entering a market or from converting 
an existing customer. The same proprietary inkjet cartridge that delivers 
high proﬁ t margins to HP after the printer was sold below cost or even 
given away in a bundle serves both purposes, lock-in and lock-out, as it 
prevents customers from moving their supply of ink to a Dell or Xerox 
machine.
Looking Ahead
The economics of information goods is sufﬁ ciently different from other 
kinds of goods that a wide variety of business decisions, personal behav-
iors, and legal issues have been affected. We will see the importance of 
lock-in, of free copy costs, and of the need for sampling in many exam-
ples in the forthcoming chapters.

Software Copying
Software copying is truly a problem without precedent. While the 
Xerox machine did not duplicate the printing (and particularly 
the binding) process, photocopying did have a major economic 
impact on at least two subsectors: textbook publishing and sheet 
music. Even so, these markets are small relative to software, music, 
movies, and proprietary research. Thus, the business model changes, 
court cases, and other signs of market adaptation to photocopying do 
not compare to the issues we face today.
There is surprisingly little literature on the historical arc of this 
issue. Nevertheless, given the prominence of Napster and its torrent-
ing successors, the world’s intellectual property interactions with the 
Chinese government and market, and the rise to economic power 
of the gaming sector, technologies of copying and its control have 
become central issues in a digital economy.
Duplicating a physical artifact requires, at the minimum, hav-
ing access to both raw materials and skills. Whether that’s steel and 
metalworking, food and cooking, or wood and carpentry, the issue 
of copying has been nonexistent in some markets and rampant in 
 others. Elsewhere, particularly in branded consumer products such as 
watches and purses, copying—imitation rather than replication—can 
be a signiﬁ cant concern. Physicality also implies a moderate barrier to 
movement: Successful counterfeiters still face the problem of getting 
merchandise to customers.
The Internet removes the barrier of getting raw materials because 
code is malleable, easily transported, and closer to idea than infra-
structure. The skill involved in copying a ﬁ le, whether of executable 
code or data, is minuscule in contrast to what was needed to cre-
ate either the software artifact or a physical original. Unlike physical 
counterfeits, which typically lack material quality and/or craftsman-
ship compared to the original, or analog copies in which successive 
generations of cassette tapes, photocopies, or faxes rapidly degrade, 
digital copies are nearly perfect. Furthermore, the means of produc-
tion (a PC) is inexpensive and ubiquitous, which makes tracing the 
origin of copies harder than locating activities with heavier infrastruc-
ture, such as radio broadcasts and LP record pressing. Finally, the 
digital distribution channel is not only faster than a physical counter-
part, it is instantaneously global.
Owners of digital content have relied on three tactics to combat 
copying.

Information Economics
First, there has been a series of attempts to make computer discs 
hard or impossible to copy by hiding ﬁ les, using proprietary for-
mats (such as game cartridges) or doing something called nibbilizing 
that rearranged the bit sequence of a copy. (Similarly, Macrovision 
enforced copy protection in analog VHS recorders.) As software 
distribution goes increasingly online, such measures still have their 
place, but they have not slowed the spread of copying by a signiﬁ -
cant margin. An exception is the video DVD (particularly Blu-ray), 
which can be copied by knowledgeable users but not casual ones: 
Proprietary protection of the digital bitstream in a DVD player or PC 
is enforced in hardware.
Second, software publishers can make it hard or impossible to use 
a copy. Some companies required users to consult a paper manual 
(“What is the last word on page 67?”) to generate crude authentica-
tion. One manual used symbols, and the company printed the man-
ual in a color scheme that was impossible to photocopy. Still  others 
relied on a hardware device called a dongle to activate a program in 
conjunction with the software and a generic PC (which quickly raised 
the problem of getting multiple dongles to interact gracefully on the 
same machine). More recently, a program can “phone home” via 
the Internet to see if software with a given serial number is in use on 
multiple machines. This approach can be made relatively robust for 
application software, and a variant called FairPlay prevents unauthor-
ized copying of Apple’s iTunes music ﬁ les. Adobe is including audit-
ing and monitoring of print materials in its LiveCycle Policy Server: If 
a user forwards an e-mail or ﬁ le, prints it, or otherwise interacts with 
it, the originator of the document can be informed. How this exten-
sive reach will affect task design and business processes remains to 
be determined.
Finally, software owners can lobby legislatures to change laws 
relating to copyright. The doctrine of fair use has been dramatically 
altered by both the duplication technologies of the past 100 years 
and the lobbying of content industries. There have been many unin-
tended consequences: Copying application software off a 5¼-inch 
ﬂ oppy onto a USB stick generally would be illegal, but with rap-
idly outmoded storage technologies, what is the owner of the appli-
cation to do if she owns a PC without the appropriate outmoded 
drive? At the enterprise and government level, archiving digital assets 
often turns into an exercise in curatorship of a technology museum: 
Successive generations of outmoded hardware and software need to 
be maintained in the event that a given ﬁ le or storage format needs

to be read. Some estimates put the number of digital formats in the 
tens of thousands.
The content industry currently tends to reject copying as backup: 
If I buy an iTunes song (or 500 of them) and my host PC’s hard drive 
dies, until cloud music lockers, I’d generally be out of luck even 
though all software was purchased and used under the terms of the 
license. Another example is DVDs: If I have two places of residence 
and want to watch a movie where I am, why must I buy a second 
copy of the same software rather than make a single copy for per-
sonal use? Once again, copyright law tends to prohibit any copying 
under blanket provisions. Such a move blurs the distinction between 
copying and counterfeiting, which are overlapping but not identical 
concepts. As processor speeds, graphics capability, and bandwidth all 
improve, content owners have lobbied to engineer copy protection 
deeper into the computing platform under the guise of anticounter-
feiting but also to preclude many activities potentially protected by 
fair use.
This degree of restriction on customer behavior would be 
unprecedented. If I want to weld a Ferrari nose onto the front end 
of a Caterpillar dump truck, Ferrari (or Caterpillar) can’t control what 
is done either with the purchased asset or, more important, an oxy-
acetylene torch. Governments have engineered protection into color 
copiers, for example, and it’s hard to argue against some degree of 
action in the public interest to protect the integrity of the money sup-
ply. But being able to use small clips of published text in scholarly 
works, for example, is standard practice—and essential to the expan-
sion of knowledge in law or literary criticism. The parallel action of 
copying any portion of a movie for personal or scholarly use, how-
ever, might be illegal, depending on jurisdiction. Similarly, the study 
of cryptography is highly regulated: Scholars who decode copy- 
protection algorithms run the risk of prosecution if they publish their 
ﬁ ndings.
Herein lies the conundrum. The digital asset copying prob-
lem is unprecedented, so new kinds and degrees of measures will 
be required. At the same time, the legitimacy of certain forms of 
 copying—for preservation, backup, or fair use—means that broad 
prohibitions, enforced in a general-purpose computing platform, 
come at an extremely high price to the purchasers and users of soft-
ware and other digital media. No single answer will apply in every 
market to every application, but there have been some noteworthy 
efforts:

Information Economics
 
 Use copying to build an installed base. Software makers with suf-
ﬁ ciently strong cash reserves and long planning horizons can 
consider letting copies go relatively unpunished to build up a 
user base. Once a large body of people is trained on the software 
and ﬁ le extensions and other conventions are well established, 
there are high enough switching costs that there may be reason 
to buy later versions of the product, particularly if the registration 
process is tightened, the pricing is attractive, and/or competitors 
have been weakened.
 
 Use copying of entertainment to sell other entertainment. The 
Grateful Dead’s support of tape-swappers who were allowed 
to record concerts is a widely cited example of allowing ama-
teur copies to thrive as an adjunct to, rather than a substitute for, 
commercially released products. Other artists have used music 
downloads as an alternative path around the gatekeepers of radio 
playlists to build live audiences for concerts—where the T-shirt 
concession is tightly protected against counterfeiters.9
 
 Reconsider analog. Several music labels, faced with plummeting 
CD sales, have turned to high-quality vinyl releases of both new 
and back catalog. Some high-end ﬁ nancial newsletters never left 
paper distribution. So-called three-dimensional printing produces 
analog physical objects based on digital models.
 
 Utilize advertising-supported distribution. Archives are a perfect 
example: While a few newspapers have succeeded in charging 
subscriptions, most are failing to monetize their back issues with 
clumsy subscription or registration models that often don’t sup-
port permanent linking from blogs or other sources of trafﬁ c. As 
paper newspapers continue to decline in circulation, the eco-
nomic models of hybrid (digital + physical) production and dis-
tribution are ripe for reinvention. As a former big-city newspaper 
editor recently noted, this talk about the sky falling on newspa-
per ad revenues has happened before: In the late 1960s, political 
advertising moved overwhelmingly to television almost over-
night, and the newspaper industry survived.
 
 Think of King Gillette and sell blades after giving away razors.10 
Giving away a multiplayer game title free, or allowing users to 
copy it without restriction, provides software publishers with 
a powerful distribution channel. (Back in the day it used to be 
called “viral.”) Recovering the cost can be achieved more effec-
tively by making the proprietary online gaming environment 
a tightly controlled, for-proﬁ t affair, with monthly or annual

renewals: Players will pay for access to other players, not for 
the plastic disc. Several online gaming environments (including 
Second Life) have spun off real economies based on cash ﬂ owing 
to merchants of virtual assets.
The list is not exhaustive but should suggest that there are 
enough viable responses to digital copying such that broad prohibi-
tion of all software copying will impose social costs that may out-
weigh proprietary beneﬁ ts. It’s important that there be open public 
debate to consider all of these potential costs, beneﬁ ts, and risks of 
various courses of action. Copying and piracy, meanwhile, are not 
one and the same, but the rhetorical landscape tends to make this 
distinction harder and harder to draw. At the same time, true piracy—
illicit DVD pressing plants, for example—should be considered and 
addressed separately rather than being conceptually lumped in with 
the many gray areas of fair use.

CHAPTER 5
Platforms
Given that one, if not the, byword of today’s technological landscape is “connected-
ness,” much attention has been focused on how systems of networked or related 
devices evolve. Whether the connection is obvious, as in mobile phones or Facebook 
friends, or less direct, as in unrelated people who all use Windows and Microsoft 
Ofﬁ ce, the notion of platforms is central to any understanding of this world. Winning 
in a platform market can be a multibillion-dollar outcome but can involve speculative 
investments of the same scale. Such household names as Apple, Google, Intel, Nokia, 
and Sony need to be understood at least in part through the platform lens.
What do we mean by the term “platform”? A few deﬁ nitions are in order. 
Platforms are foundational technologies, building blocks upon which an 
entire industry might develop. Michael Cusumano of MIT and his then-
graduate student Annabelle Gawer were plainspoken in their essential 
study of the topic: A platform is “an evolving system made of interdepen-
dent pieces that can each be innovated upon.”1 That’s concise but dense, 
and worth playing out: Platforms have to evolve, which presents challeng-
ing issues around innovation, return on investment, and other strategic 
decisions. Platforms are the product of multiple actors: Even Microsoft, 
a dominant company if ever there was one, relied on both a powerful 
network of software developers to build applications on the foundation 
technology and a myriad of hardware companies. Platforms are systems, 
not merely products: Their interdependent aspects can create prisoner’s 
dilemma and other game theory scenarios, as when developers must 
choose where to focus their innovation and programming efforts. For 
these individuals and companies, betting on Microsoft in 1990 was a good 
move, as was aligning with the Apple App Store in 2008.

Growth in a Connected World

Platforms
Harvard’s Thomas Eisenmann and his colleagues Geoffrey Parker 
and Marshall Van Alstyne focus on the networks that rise up in the pres-
ence of a platform; these scholars account for the actors as much as the 
technologies:
A platform-mediated network is comprised of users whose transac-
tions are subject to direct and/or indirect network effects, along with 
one or more intermediaries that facilitate users’ transactions. . . .  
Rules are used to coordinate network participants’ activities. They 
include standards that ensure compatibility among different compo-
nents, protocols that govern information exchange, policies that con-
strain user behavior, and contracts that specify terms of trade and 
the rights and responsibilities of network participants.2
Most of these aspects are straightforward, but for now, the role of 
rules should be highlighted. Whether in the form of government regula-
tions, technical standards, or copyright or patent protection, these rules 
can become exceedingly complicated, expensive to create and enforce, 
and difﬁ cult to time with regard to the market. The right rule set can 
accelerate time to broad adoption; the wrong set can stall innovation in 
committees, litigation, or market uncertainty. Notable failed platforms 
include the 3DO video game, Super Audio Compact Disc (SACD) music 
format, and IBM’s OS/2 computer operating system.
Recently, a strand of scholarship has been focusing on ways that a 
platform can be either one-sided or two-sided.3 In the former case, there 
are sellers and there are purchaser/users: In wireline telephony, the Bell 
company or companies were on one side and “subscribers” were on the 
other. Innovation was minimal, and the system, while closed, was excep-
tionally proﬁ table and predictable. AT&T was a monopoly provider, from 
the handsets all the way through the infrastructure and voice services. By 
contrast, we now see examples of one-sided platforms with multiple ﬁ rms, 
beginning with mobile telephony: Person A with a Samsung phone on 
T-Mobile can seamlessly call person B who has a Motorola phone operat-
ing on the Sprint network. Standards and protocols make such behavior 
possible.
Two-sided markets are exempliﬁ ed by a credit card company: Before 
consumers will carry the card, they want to know that it will be accepted 
by many merchants. Merchants, for their part, want to know that enough 
consumers will use the card to justify the expenses of vendor adoption. 
Getting both sides of the platform to invest, especially in the early stages, 
can be challenging but extremely advantageous once the “ﬂ ywheel effect” 
kicks in: One side of the interaction often subsidizes the other. More 
recently, Apple’s nurturing of application developers on one side and

end users on the other has worked extremely well: A large app selec-
tion enhances the iPhone’s market appeal just as large user markets attract 
more developers. Shopping malls, health maintenance organizations, and 
video game console manufacturers also operate in two-sided markets.4
A wide range of strategic decisions is involved in platform success, 
none more important than opening or closing the platform. (This may or 
may not involve opening the source code: Linux is both open source and 
an open platform. The terms can be confusing.) eBay is a closed plat-
form in the sense that user identities and reputational proﬁ les work only 
within the auction site. For several years in the United States, Apple’s 
iPhone worked only on AT&T’s network. Apple imposes standards of con-
tent appropriateness and performance on third-party apps that Google’s 
Android platform does not. Every DVD player’s price includes royalties to 
the platform’s creators, and all players are strictly deﬁ ned in their features 
and performance. Closed platforms beneﬁ t from interoperability at the 
expense of innovation; for open platforms, the reverse is usually the case. 
Android users might need to run antivirus software on their smartphones 
but do not face the limits Apple places on the iPhone ecosystem.
In contrast, any 120-volt electrical appliance should work in any U.S. 
state. ISO* standards govern shipping containers, which will ﬁ t on any 
ship in any port. Closed platforms such as video games keep all proﬁ t 
within a small number of partner companies, while open platforms (such 
as 802.11 or Wi-Fi, not to mention the Internet itself) can grow exception-
ally large, sometimes exhibiting literally global network effects along with 
coordination and compatibility issues.
Platforms can be controlled by one or more companies in two dimen-
sions: who controls the platform, usually through patents, and who deliv-
ers it to the market? Sony owns the PlayStation intellectual property (IP), 
licenses the rights to build games for it to outside ﬁ rms, and handles 
console design and manufacturing in-house. Industry consortia such as 
the one behind Orbitz may have multiple entities that own the IP, even 
though there is a single channel to market. The DVD standard, by con-
trast, is owned by a small number of ﬁ rms and delivered to the market by 
hundreds.5
Until Linux proved otherwise, conventional wisdom held that plat-
forms needed proprietary control: Microsoft Windows, the AT&T phone 
network, and the compact disc owned by Sony and Philips are familiar 
examples. The following exchange between the widely respected MIT 
*The International Organization for Standardization, a non-governmental organiza-
tion, is the world’s largest developer and publisher of international standards.

economist Lester Thurow and Computer Reseller News, a major trade publi-
cation, illustrated a widely held skepticism:
CRN: Do you think the Linux operating system will be successful?
THUROW: It can’t possibly work. It’s open architecture. People 
change it, and the changes aren’t compatible. Look at Unix. There 
are now 18 different incompatible versions. That started out as 
one system with open architecture. The only way [software] can be 
compatible is if one company owns it.6
At the same time that Linux and other fully open platforms are enjoy-
ing great success, Apple is building a series of mobile platforms that, 
while in some ways are closed, are also extremely proﬁ table. According 
to Morgan Stanley’s Mary Meeker, the iPhone and iPod Touch surpassed 
50 million units shipped in nine quarters after launch.7 Netscape Navigator 
reportedly had 38 million downloads in 18 months, but that could include 
double and triple counting. In addition, Netscape’s Internet distribution 
model allowed it a substantial advantage over conventional logistics while 
Apple physically moved all those devices.
The iPhone and Android platforms have spurred a vast ecosystem of 
software developers. Hundreds of thousands of applications for each plat-
form are available. While about 400,000 are free and the average selling 
price is $1.44 for paid apps, GPS add-ons from TomTom sell for $50. Other 
top sellers include mobile editions of both conventional board games such 
as Uno and electronic games like Madden.
Thus, the iPhone neatly illustrates the interdependent aspects of a 
platform. Those applications are helping drive truly staggering demands 
on bandwidth. Researchers at the giant networking company Cisco 
Systems estimate that global mobile bandwidth demand will increase 
66 times in the four years following 2009. Based on AT&T’s experience, 
that number is fully believable: Mobile data trafﬁ c increased 4,962% 
(essentially 50 times) in the three years following the iPhone launch, but 
time will tell. The wide dissatisfaction with iPhone performance was often 
blamed on AT&T’s network, but provisioning that kind of growth would 
tax any organization. In addition, as much as the iPhone has stressed the 
cellular network, the picture would be far worse if Wi-Fi, which is essen-
tially ten times faster, had not picked up so much of the load.
Strategic Levers
The key themes of Gawer and Cusumano’s case study of Intel are inter-
dependency and innovation, both of which involve players operating out-
side the traditional vertically integrated ﬁ rm yet that need to be managed.

Strategic Levers 
61
While the tech sector is obviously characterized by these dynamics, the 
authors point out that more and more industries have this structure, in 
part because of the increasing software content outside computers. As the 
Intel story unfolds, many of the lessons—about openness, about competi-
tion, about internal friction—do in fact translate far beyond the world of 
semiconductor design and fabrication.
Gawer and Cusumano assert that ﬁ rms have four basic “levers” they 
can pull to inﬂ uence the direction of a platform that typically is not 
owned by any one ﬁ rm.8 These levers are:
 1. Scope of the ﬁ rm. This is a macroscopic view of the buy/build deci-
sion: What gets done inside, or outside, or in both places? How are 
changes to these priorities and competencies decided and navigated?
 2. Product technology. In particular, how are decisions made and exe-
cuted with regard to architecture, interfaces, and intellectual property? 
How modular is a product or subunit? How open are the interface 
technologies* used to integrate third-party innovation?
 3. Relationships with external complementors. Does a platform leader 
follow Intel, which in the 1990s professed not to want to drive com-
panies out of business? Or is the model closer to Microsoft, which 
repeatedly did so by swallowing software functionality introduced by 
competitors, typically into the operating system?
 4. Internal organization. Intel is a huge, powerful company with the 
usual ﬁ efdoms and internal competitiveness. How are these delim-
ited and ruled in such a way as to support innovation of interdepen-
dent pieces? How are culture and process managed? Perhaps most 
critically, how are long-term industry efforts (such as the USB stan-
dard) accounted for in quarterly ﬁ nancial reporting and performance 
measurements?
The Intel Architecture Lab was a critically important piece of com-
puting history during the boom of the 1990s, a place that embodied 
the paradox of “coopetition”: Secrets were shared (in the form of 
forthcoming Intel architectures and speciﬁ cations), interoperability 
was assured (usually) on equal terms, and new markets were invaded 
(in the case of the incursion of the PCI† bus on IBM territory). The 
stated goal was to sell more processors not by stealing share as a pri-
mary tactic but by increasing the vitality of the entire PC industry.
* A classic example is the application programming interface, or API, which sets 
the rules of the road for different software components to interact with each other.
† A bus is a subsystem, something like a switch in the lay sense, that transfers 
data between components inside a computer. IBM owned several bus standards 
(including ISA) in the early 1990s that were superseded by an Intel-led consortium 
that developed the royalty-free, technically superior PCI speciﬁ cations.

Platforms
Related to this type of position, platform owners must be aware 
of a particular competitive dynamic known as platform envelop-
ment.9 As opposed to traditional ﬁ rm-based competition (Coke versus 
Pepsi), platform ecosystems can win or lose somewhat independently 
of any given company’s strategy or execution. 3-D television is one 
example. For existing platforms, the business model often can be 
undermined by the incorporation of a platform inside a larger sys-
tem: Microsoft was fought in court by Real Networks over the nature 
of Windows-based media players that replicated Real’s functionality. 
Western Union’s telegraph business was rendered obsolete by e-mail, 
a business outcome for which no strategic response (lowering prices, 
mergers or acquisitions, entry into new markets) would have been 
adequate. Thus, competition in the age of platforms concerns new 
kinds of strategic constraints and possibilities.
Finally, because of the highly connected and interconnected 
nature of the technology landscape, corporate competition may now 
be less central than platform competition. Consider the long list of 
contemporary platforms, some not directly competing with any others 
yet all a product of the Internet age:

Looking Ahead
The companies, entities, and standards just listed will be key to under-
standing the next 25 years. As opposed to being the age of the great rail-
roads, or AT&T, or Wal-Mart, American business success will increasingly 
be deﬁ ned by platform dynamics: innovation, revenue capture, ecosystem 
health and development, and lock-in and lock-out. Next we turn to the 
issue of what kinds of markets will emerge to engage these platforms.

CHAPTER 6
Power Laws and Their 
Implications
While many people are accustomed to seeing bell curves explaining many facets of 
everyday reality, these statistical distributions do an extremely poor job of explaining 
information, or risk, or social network landscapes. Instead, power laws explain both 
the leviathans of the Internet—Facebook or Google—and the millions of YouTube vid-
eos that apparently nobody watches. The behavior of systems that conform to these 
curves is both predictable and new as compared to scenarios involving physical wid-
gets sold through physical stores in local markets.
A Bit of History
Back at the turn of the century, the Internet sector was in the middle of 
a momentous slide in market capitalization. Priceline went from nearly 
$500 a share to single digits in three quarters. CDnow fell from $23 to 
$3.40 in about nine months ending in March 2000. Corvis, Music Maker, 
Dr. Koop—2000 was a meltdown the likes of which few investors had 
ever seen or imagined. Science was invoked to explain this new world of 
Internet business.
Bernardo Huberman, then at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center 
(PARC), and others found that the proportion of Web sites that got the 
bulk of the trafﬁ c fell far from standard market share metrics: As of 
December 1, 1997, the top 1% of the Web site population accounted for 
over 55% of all trafﬁ c.1 This kind of distribution was not new, as it turned 
out. A Harvard linguist with the splendid name of George Zipf counted

words and found that a tiny percentage of the English language accounts 
for a disproportionate share of usage. A Zipf distribution, plotted on a log-
log scale, is a straight line from upper left to lower right. In linear scale, it 
plunges from the top left and then goes ﬂ at for the characteristic long tail 
of the distribution: Twosies and then onesies occupy most of the x-axis, as 
seen in Figure 6.1.
Given such “scientiﬁ c” logic, investors began to argue that the 
Internet was a new kind of market, with high barriers to entry that made 
incumbents’ positions extremely secure. Michael Mauboussin, then at CS 
First Boston and now at Legg Mason, wrote a paper in late 1999 called 
“Absolute Power.”2 In it he asserted that “power laws . . .   strongly support 
the view that on-line markets are winner-take-all.” But winners don’t take 
all: Since that time, Google has challenged and surpassed Yahoo, weblogs 
have markedly deteriorated trafﬁ c to online news sites, and MySpace 
lost its early lead in social networking. Is the Zipf distribution somehow 
changing? Were power laws wrongly applied or somehow misunderstood?
In 2004, Chris Anderson, editor of Wired, had a different reading of 
the graph. Instead of looking at the few very big winners at the head, 
he focused on the long tail. In an article that became a book, Anderson 
explained how a variety of Web businesses have prospered by success-
fully addressing the very large number of niches in any given market. 
Jeff Bezos, for instance, at one time estimated that 30% of the books 
Amazon sold weren’t in physical retailers. Unlike Excite, which couldn’t 
make money posting banner ads against the mostly unique queries that 
came into the site, Google uses Adwords to sell nearly anything to how-
ever many people search for something related to it, one search at a time.

thus satisfy any ﬁ lm nut’s most esoteric request. eBay matches a vast selec-
tion of goods with a global audience of both mass and niche customers.
Long-Tail Successes
Amazon, eBay, Google, and Netﬂ ix—the four horsemen of the long 
tail, as it were—share several important characteristics. First, they either 
ofﬂ oad physical inventory to other parties (in the Netﬂ ix case, its ware-
house network includes customers’ kitchen tables) or have developed best-
in-the-world supply chain management (Amazon). Google touches as few 
invoices as possible and no physical product whatsoever.
Second, each company has invested in matching large, sparse 
populations of customers to large, sparse populations of products. 
That investment might take the form of search: AltaVista founder Louis 
Monier worked at eBay for a time; Amazon tried to make a run at 
Google in general search with A9 in 2006 before retrenching and inno-
vating in more focused “search inside the book” and mobile/location 
services. As Netﬂ ix showed, other technologies are powerful in the long 
tail as well: Using collaborative ﬁ ltering, social reviewing, and audience 
surveys, both Amazon and Netﬂ ix have become expert at predicting 
future desires based on past behavior.
This sparseness, combined with the Internet’s vast scale, is the deﬁ n-
ing characteristic of the long tail. As YouTube illustrates, people are happy 
to create content for small or even nonexistent audiences. At the same 
time, producers of distinctive small-market goods (like weblogs, garage 
demo music, and self-published books) can through a variety of mecha-
nisms reach a paying public. Thus, the news is good for both makers and 
users, buyers and sellers to the point that libertarian commentator Virginia 
Postrel has made huge selection a political issue, writing on the virtues of 
the choice and variety we currently enjoy.3
Cautionary Tales
In his hugely inﬂ uential tandem of books, The Black Swan and Fooled 
by Randomness, Nassim Nicholas Taleb raised the contrast between 
power laws and Gaussian (bell curve) distributions to the level of cul-
tural criticism.4 He asserted that risk, wealth, fame, and information on 
networks all ﬁ t long-tail distributions, noting that fat-tail risk (global ﬁ nan-
cial meltdown, tsunamis, Hurricane Katrina, etc.) is both always with us 
and all-too-frequently left unacknowledged by the ubiquitous bell curves 
employed by ﬁ nancial analysts. The events of 2008 seemed to bear him

Power Laws and Their Implications
out, for reasons we will see in Chapter 7 on risk. For our purposes, it is 
important to focus on the loss of the “average” as a meaningful concept in 
power law scenarios. We will return to the implications of this fact soon.
The second caution about the long tail comes from a different direc-
tion. Dan Frankowski was working on an early social data set at the 
University of Minnesota: the MovieLens ﬁ lm rating system. He and his 
coresearchers found that as data got sparser (such as with a large list 
of movies, many of which got only a handful of votes), it became eas-
ier to link a public comment on a message board, for example, with a 
private data point (a rating on MovieLens or, hypothetically, a rental at 
Netﬂ ix). Whereas rating or commenting on a hit movie at the head of the 
distribution was reasonably anonymous, moving out onto the tail, espe-
cially in conjunction with expressions related to other titles in the sparse 
space, signiﬁ cantly increased the odds of reidentiﬁ cation.5 This dynamic 
is informing many other technologies aimed at ﬁ nding important relation-
ships in large, noisy data sets.
Facts of Life
Living in a long tail has new costs, opportunities, and risks. Recent 
research suggests that the long tail is getting both longer and more lucra-
tive. MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleagues compared Amazon’s sales 
data from 2000 to 2008. After quantitatively rigorous analysis, the conclu-
sions are vivid: “The . . .   results provide empirical evidence that Amazon’s 
Long Tail has become longer and fatter in 2008 than in 2000. As sales 
ranks increase, book sales decline. Such a decline is at a slower pace in 
2008 than in 2000.”6
At about the same time, University of Pennsylvania Professor Serguei 
Netessine and his colleague Tom F. Tan analyzed movie rental data 
that was part of the data set made available to Netﬂ ix prize* research-
ers. They came to a similar conclusion comparing customer habits in 2000 
versus 2005: There was a marked drop in demand for the top 500 titles, 
the “knee” of the curve was thicker, and 15% of demand came from titles 
ranked below 3,000, which is the inventory of a typical physical video 
store. As Figure 6.2 illustrates, the long tail at Netﬂ ix grew both fatter and 
longer after the year 2000, just as it had at Amazon.7
*An innovative competition sponsored by the video rental ﬁ rm: Machine learn-
ing and other statistical experts competed for a $1 million prize, along with other 
bonuses, awarded to teams that improved Netﬂ ix’s algorithmic matching of user 
attributes with predicted enjoyment of a given movie title.

Implications
For merchandising, selection can become a basis of competition in ways 
it could never be in physical stores. Especially for digital goods, such 
as Kindle books or music and movie downloads, the lack of physical 
inventory rewrites the rules on competition. Demand planning, produc-
tion planning, and logistics of getting the right number of units to where 
demand is expected to materialize are no longer issues. As with app stores 
for basically the same reason, digital downloads remove much of the risk 
from the seller, which can pay royalties after sale without up-front invest-
ment in inventory.
As we saw, long tails of supply can now be matched more effec-
tively with sparse communities of demand. The net result is that formerly 
neglected items ﬁ nd larger audiences, and while they may or may not 
become hits (as in the case of Soulja Boy*), some songs, videos, and eBay 
items do climb out of the long tail of obscurity. Price and availability will 
change accordingly: If World War II recruiting posters become popular for

That,” which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100) that spawned countless

Power Laws and Their Implications
whatever reason, people with access to such artifacts will be more likely 
to bring them to market. Inventory items can thus move up or down the 
power law curve.
Both eBay and Amazon shift the risk of holding physical inventory 
onto extensive networks of partners. Netﬂ ix, Apple, and Google are striv-
ing to become purely digital in their content businesses. Compared to 
Best Buy or Tower Records of the 1980s, the organizational shape, capital 
requirements, growth prospects, and hiring needs of a twenty-ﬁ rst-century 
content business are completely different.
Outside the entertainment realm, Linux and Wikipedia turn out to 
exhibit long-tail traits on the supply side: A small number of very busy con-
tributors do a huge percentage of the work, but the long tail of contribu-
tors of single items turns out to be a signiﬁ cant population as well.8 Not all 
contributions are of equal weight: If a solitary contributor writes one piece 
of code or biography that wouldn’t have been completed otherwise, it is a 
potentially important win for the overall effort. The Internet commentator 
Clay Shirky makes this point clearly: Traditional organizations cannot afford 
to have large numbers of contributors who don’t contribute much. Pareto 
reigns, on the logic that “we can have 5% of the population do 85% of the 
work.” Indeed, that would be a fortunate company. But in the connected, 
global world of voluntary, loose organizational forms, low coordination 
costs enable the perhaps quirky, perhaps uninspired contributions of the 
long tail to be harvested at low if any cost.9
Looking Ahead
For these reasons, management is changing at places like developer net-
works, as we will see in Chapter 17: One-tenth of 1% of Google Android 
applications have more than 50,000 downloads; 79% of titles have reached 
fewer than 100 people. Because of the app store structure, however, no 
product planner needs to develop ulcers about slow-selling titles: All the 
risk is borne by the developers as Apple and Google much prefer to gain 
market share in hardware.10 At the same time, managing the entire ecosys-
tem presents new challenges: With low barriers to entry and hundreds of 
thousands of applications to manage, even something as simple as paying 
application developers can be a real headache. In addition, maintaining 
the platform’s attractiveness is vitally important but involves many intan-
gibles and competitive pressures, just as product development does, but 
in a far less constrained space. Long tails also change the possibilities for 
how people and resources organize to get work done, as we see in the 
next chapter.

CHAPTER 7
Security and Risk
The task of security has evolved rapidly in an interconnected age. Where previously 
police and private forces had to protect physical assets with fences, locks, and other 
tangible efforts, now both threats and assets can be ephemeral and distributed. 
Networks of networks introduce redundancy (as in a power grid, where the local gen-
erating plant no longer constitutes a single point of failure), but they also introduce 
unprecedented levels of complexity. That complexity underlies all considerations of 
security, which has moved from obvious efforts to protect things and people from 
harm (in the ways just mentioned) to become a maze of cost-beneﬁ t-risk consider-
ations. Those calculations are complicated by humans’ completely predictable inability 
to assess risk rationally.
Considered as a sociotechnical system of people and technologies inter-
acting in both directions, the discipline of security must be conducted very 
differently as compared to local efforts of a constabulary or parking lot 
guard. Thus, our focus here is on the managerial imperatives rather than 
on the techniques of perimeter protection, intrusion detection, ﬁ rewall 
selection and conﬁ guration, password resets, and other activities that often 
constitute the focus of the discipline. In short, mastering the domains of 
costs (hard and soft), beneﬁ ts, and risks requires new skills, new metrics, 
and new attitudes compared to the practice of physical security conducted 
in local settings.
Landscape
The Internet is increasingly made mobile and connects billions of 
devices both stationary and in motion, “users” both animate and elec-
tronic, and for purposes ranging from deep-space exploration to

Security and Risk
commercial exploitation of humanity’s basest desires. Given such broad 
span, it presents ample opportunities for people to ﬁ nd trouble. Put sim-
ply, humanity has never attempted to manage anything so big, so rapidly 
evolving, so distributed, or so complicated. A few numbers only hint at 
the size of the challenge; the scale is nearly impossible for humans to 
comprehend, which is one of the key issues in dealing with security and 
risk:
 
 Both Google and Bing estimate 1 trillion Web pages as of mid-2010.
 
 Out of a global population of more than 7 billion people, roughly 
2 billion people are online.
 
 In the United States alone, mobile devices generate 600 billion geo-
tagged messages—each day—accurate to within 10 meters if you’re 
on a Wi-Fi connection.1
 
 Half of Facebook’s more than 500 million users check in daily; by 
itself, the site accounts for one-quarter of all U.S. page views and a 
third of all online ads.
 
 Cisco estimates that Internet Protocol (IP) trafﬁ c will quadruple 
between 2009 and 2014.
For anything so sprawling and fast-moving, conventional understandings 
clearly fail; seeing ﬁ rewalls as being “like fences,” for example,  constitutes a 
cognitive trap. The scale of bad things occurring in information space is simi-
larly difﬁ cult to apprehend:
 
 Symantec, a digital security vendor, observed 14.6 trillion spam mes-
sages in the third quarter of 2010, which is approximately 91% of 
all e-mail trafﬁ c. Spam increased 100,000% between 1997 and 2004, 
according to the IEEE.
 
 Personal records for 26 million U.S. military veterans were compro-
mised when a single laptop computer went missing in 2008.
 
 Heartland Payment Systems, a credit card processor, reported a data 
breach of roughly 130 million records in 2009.
 
 As of late 2011, more than 2,600 reported U.S. data breaches had 
exposed more than 500 million records, according to privacyrights.org.
 
 The Conﬁ cker worm alone has infected an estimated 12 million PCs 
since 2008.
 
 As of 2010, one thousand credit card numbers could be bought on 
underground services for $300, only 30 cents per user.
 
 The Kroxxu bot network had infected over 100,000 Web domains 
between its launch in 2009 and a year later, as opposed to attacking 
personal computers as had been previous practice.

Information Space Is Neither Average nor Normal 
75
Information Space Is Neither Average nor Normal
As discussed in more detail in Chapter 6, information spaces present 
prime examples of fat-tailed distributions: A few population members 
for examples are disproportionately huge (Google and Facebook, Harry 
Potter books, Avatar and Pirates of the Caribbean), while the curve of 
the distribution rapidly descends into the famous long tail of onesies and 
twosies. Thinking of this world in terms of the familiar bell curve concep-
tualization is impossible: The “average” Web site or information good is a 
contradiction in terms. If Harry Potter volume 19 sells 5 million copies and 
a routine academic study of medieval France sells 20 copies, talking about 
2.5 million as the average of the two makes no sense whatsoever.
The infrastructure needed to manage an Amazon or a Yahoo! reﬂ ects 
this extremity. Data center buildings run in the hundreds of thousands of 
square feet, pulling down in excess of an estimated 100-megawatt power 
feeds. (For comparison, aluminum smelters use between 150 and 450 
megawatts.) On the output side of the equation, Google served about 
3 billion searches per day in late 2009, according to data compiled by 
market research ﬁ rm comscore; that’s 34,000 per second.2
In such a world, threats to information are not random or average. In 
a power-law scenario, one example (a Harry Potter or Warren Buffett, in 
wealth) can alter the entire landscape; in a bell curve assumption, however, 
large sample sizes guarantee curve smoothing: No one instance of human 
height or focus-group preference can reshape the landscape. In other words, 
Bill Gates can be 10 billion times richer than a random Kenyan, but nobody 
can eat 10 billion times more cherry  Pop-Tarts than another customer. 
Nobody can stand even 1 order of magnitude taller than her neighbor.
This potential for extremity has signiﬁ cant implications for risk man-
agement: Very, very bad things can happen in hypernetworked environ-
ments. Whether in regard to the spread of rumors or malware, the speed 
and scale of today’s networks drive risk skyward. For example, in 2003 
the Slammer worm (technologically simple compared to the current gen-
eration of malware) infected 75,000 machines in 10 minutes.
As Nassim Nicholas Taleb noted in The Black Swan, bell curve dis-
tributions use averaging across many samples within a ﬁ nite range to 
generate certainty.3 In information and risk space, one instance outside 
the presumed norm (a BP oil spill, a Hurricane Katrina, a Heartland data 
breach) can alter the entire landscape. Given extreme interconnection, 
two consequences emerge: (1) The Internet allows enormous popula-
tions (sometimes audiences) to be assembled, and (2) changes can spread 
across populations extremely rapidly. Both of these realities change funda-
mental facets of security practice as compared to previous eras.

Security and Risk
People Systematically Misestimate Risk
Here’s a simple experiment. The following list of hazards to Americans’ 
health is alphabetical, but seeing them listed from riskiest to least risky 
reveals extreme differences in probability: There are no split hairs. Even 
when asking a group, where there is some averaging of opinion and pool-
ing of knowledge (a lifeguard knows about sharks while a daughter of a 
lung cancer survivor may know about that disease), there are invariably 
big misses: Perception, fear, and reality do not align. Try listing these from 
the most deaths per year to the least:
 
 Airplane accidents
 
 Cancer
 
 Dog attacks
 
 Lightning
 
 Motor vehicle accidents
 
 Murder
 
 Residential ﬁ res
 
 Sharks
Invariably, individuals’ fears, phobias, and recent experiences color 
perception of something as intrinsically attention-getting as accidental 
death. While infrequent events typically are confused, it’s also common 
for people not to realize the most deadly phenomena on the list: Note 
that number 1 outranks number 2 by well over an order of magnitude 
(numbers refer to deaths per year), yet precautions against cancer are not 
ubiquitous:
 1. Cancer: 550,000
 2. Motor vehicle accidents: 42,000
 3. Murder: 16,000
 4. Residential ﬁ res: 3,500
 5. Airplane accidents: 600
 6. Lightning: 90
 7. Dog attacks: 20
 8. Sharks: <1
Why does this confusion about danger matter? Security does 
not simply involve keeping bad people from doing bad things to me 
or my organization. Instead, particularly in virtual settings involv-
ing often-intangible assets, security is a matter of priority setting, risk–
reward trade-offs, and other managerial assessments. If people cannot

Doing It Right 
77
understand in a very rational way the risk of dying, it takes considerable 
self-awareness, careful fact ﬁ nding, and professional judgment to make 
good decisions regarding risks of less intuitive events on behalf of other 
people.
As we can see at any U.S. airport, security decisions typically are 
made by people away from the front lines—as well they should, pro-
vided the senior decision makers are adequately informed. At the same 
time, security policies can and often do reﬂ ect agendas far removed 
from actually keeping assets or people safer: The political uses of the 
Transportation Security Administration threat level colors in the 2004 elec-
tion stand as an obvious example. The combination of multiple priorities 
and human logical fallibility relative to risk, however, means that a lot of 
time, money, and effort can be expended with little measurable impact on 
security or risk mitigation.
Instead, what security guru Bruce Schneier has called “security the-
ater” often presents visual and dramatic elements that manipulate public 
perception with little impact on real threats.4 A few examples should 
sufﬁ ce:
 
 In the 1950s and 1960s, schoolchildren practiced ducking under desks 
in the event of a nuclear attack.
 
 After the 9/11 attacks, National Guardsmen patrolled public places 
carrying automatic weapons. It was never revealed whether all of 
the weapons were actually loaded, given the danger posed by a ner-
vous, semitrained civilian with such a powerful weapon in a crowded 
scenario.
 
 Nail clippers were long banned from aircraft even though any of the 
soda cans routinely emptied during the ﬂ ight could be turned into 
something far more lethal with no tools whatsoever.
In short, “security theater” is a predictable outcome of the normal 
decision-making process, reﬂ ecting the political dimension of organiza-
tional behavior rather than a sensible response to an actual threat.
Doing It Right
Many people have written extensively and well on the topic of effective 
security, not least of all Schneier. Three points bear consideration:
 1. Security involves people. People are both irrationally afraid of things 
that pose little risk (sharks) and casual with devices that can be quite

Security and Risk
dangerous if used incorrectly: Cars, text messaging, and USB drives 
each can serve as an example. At the same time, as Cormac Herley of 
Microsoft Research has shown, users of information systems behave 
rationally given their personal position on a risk–reward continuum: 
What systems administrators understand as part of a totality, users 
often see as hassles or roadblocks to be avoided.5 He notes that pass-
word resets, close inspection of web addresses for phishing threats, 
and checking digital authentication certiﬁ cates all take too much time 
relative to the slim likelihood that such practices will confer a beneﬁ t 
to an individual. In short, private incentives must be managed in the 
pursuit of organizational objectives.
Effective security thus requires that people be motivated, so 
behavioral economics, with its emphasis on reward structures and 
actual actions rather than ﬁ ctional economic creatures, becomes 
highly relevant. Logic was not enough to make hospital doctors and 
other personnel wash their hands, for example, even though the 
beneﬁ ts were obvious and dramatic. Similarly, more sophisticated 
designs for enterprise security will balance rewards and punish-
ments in original and clever ways rather than simply having admin-
istrators dictating ofﬁ cial procedure and expecting (or demanding) 
compliance.
 2. Security involves systems. Much like usability, to which security is 
obviously related, security is too seldom seen as a system or, more 
typically in a connected world, a system of systems. Designing sys-
tems (network security) is much more difﬁ cult than designing 
products (ﬁ rewalls). Policies and procedures span organizational 
boundaries, become brittle with time, and must interact in the pur-
suit of various purposes. (The same employee ID that gets you past 
the security guard announces your name and perhaps other informa-
tion to potential intruders who take careful notes while you go out for 
lunch wearing the badge.)
Getting systems to be usable, evolving, robust against multiple 
types of threat, and affordable is extremely difﬁ cult. Because systems 
transcend organizations, and because security is effective only when 
nothing happens, budgeting against risk is difﬁ cult. Who pays, who 
beneﬁ ts, and who is inconvenienced frequently misalign. Interfaces 
between systems are particularly hard to get right, not least because 
organizational authority must be managed across various gaps. 
Parking lots are problematic for this reason: Building or store security 
and the door locks on the automobile are both effective, but at the 
interface, attackers exploit various weaknesses that fall between orga-
nizational mandates.

Doing It Right 
79
Designing Usable Systems
Why is it so hard to get usability right? As Don Norman, one of the 
heroic ﬁ gures in modern usability studies, puts it, complex products 
are not merely things; they provide services: “[A]lthough a camera is 
thought of as a product, its real value is the service it offers to its 
owner: Cameras provide memories. Similarly, music players provide a 
service: the enjoyment of listening.”6 In this light, the product must be 
considered as part of a system that supports experience, and systems 
thinking is hard, complicated, and difﬁ cult to accomplish in function-
ally siloed organizations.
The ubiquitous iPod makes his point perfectly.
The iPod is a story of systems thinking, so let me repeat the 
essence for emphasis. It is not about the iPod; it is about 
the system. Apple was the ﬁ rst company to license music for 
downloading. It provides a simple, easy to understand pric-
ing scheme. It has a ﬁ rst-class website that is not only easy to 
use but fun as well. The purchase, downloading the song 
to the computer and thence to the iPod are all handled well 
and effortlessly. And the iPod is indeed well designed, 
well thought out, a pleasure to look at, to touch and hold, and 
to use. Then there is the Digital Rights Management system, 
invisible to the user, but that both satisﬁ es legal issues and 
locks the customer into lifelong servitude to Apple (this part of 
the system is undergoing debate and change). There is also 
the huge number of third-party add-ons that help increase the 
power and pleasure of the unit while bringing a very large, 
high-margin income to Apple for licensing and royalties. 
Finally, the “Genius Bar” of experts offering service advice 
freely to Apple customers who visit the Apple stores transforms 
the usual unpleasant service experience into a pleasant explo-
ration and learning experience. There are other excellent 
music players. No one seems to understand the systems think-
ing that has made Apple so successful.
One of the designers of the iPod interface, Paul Mercer of Pixo, 
afﬁ rms that systems thinking shaped the design process: “The iPod 
is very simple-minded, in terms of at least what the device does. It’s 
very smooth in what it does, but the screen is low-resolution, and it

Security and Risk
really doesn’t do much other than let you navigate your music. That 
tells you two things. It tells you ﬁ rst that the simpliﬁ cation that went 
into the design was very well thought through, and second that the 
capability to build it is not commoditized.”7 Thus, more complex man-
agement and design vision are prerequisites for user simpliﬁ cation.
Because it requires systems thinking and complex organizational 
behavior to achieve, usability is often last on the list of design criteria, 
behind such considerations as manufacturability or modular assem-
bly, materials costs, packaging, skill levels of the factory employees, 
and so on. The hall of shame for usability issues is far longer than 
the list of successes. For every garage door opener, LEGO brick, or 
Amazon Kindle, there are multiple BMW iDrives, Windows ribbons, 
European faucets, or inconsistent anesthesia machines: Doctors on a 
machine from company A turned the upper right knob clockwise to 
increase the ﬂ ow rate but had to go counterclockwise on company 
B’s machine in the next operating room over. Fortunately, the indus-
try has standardized the control interface, with a resulting decline in 
human endangerment.8
 3. Security involves trade-offs. Here we return to the crux of why risk 
management is too often both ineffective and overly expensive. 
While many security measures involve technical expertise, sometimes 
expensive and/or extensive, the managerial process of counterbal-
ancing goals, objectives, resources, costs, and consequences can be 
mightily complex. The technical skills involved in perimeter protec-
tion, fraud detection, or antishoplifting measures can be esoteric, to 
be sure, but effective security is not a technical battle; it’s a manage-
ment problem. The trade-offs have much less to do with the hardware 
elements of the relevant systems than with the power relationships 
and competing agendas of the people involved.
Bruce Schneier gets the last word here. He proposes a simple 
ﬁ ve-step rubric for assessing a security solution that can expose some 
of these agendas to scrutiny and reasoned discussion:
 a. What assets are you trying to protect? This question is often less 
obvious than it may appear.
 b. What are the risks to those assets?
 c. How well does the security solution mitigate those risks?
 d. What other risks does the security solution cause? Unintended 
consequences proliferate in these situations: Bank vaults did not 
need to be blown open when kidnapping the manager’s spouse

81
was an option; time locks were the countermeasure to the 
countermeasure.
 e. What costs and trade-offs does the security solution impose?9
Everything important is addressed in this process: A $5,000 door 
lock to protect $200 worth of property would be exposed, as would 
soft costs, such as inconvenience or false positives. Too often the fea-
tures and functionality of the door lock or other technology become 
the focal point rather than their being weighed in rational fashion 
alongside the other four facets of the proposed solution.
Looking Ahead
Unfortunately, few security measures are introduced in this considered 
fashion, so we continue to live with unnecessary vulnerabilities, excessive 
expense, and intrusive and/or obnoxious measures that impose excessive 
costs on users and bystanders. Unfortunately, given the nature of both 
today’s threats and institutions, the situation is unlikely to improve dra-
matically any time soon.

CHAPTER 8
A Brief History 
of Organizational Innovation
To set the context for the new organizational possibilities being created at the juncture 
of computing and communications, it’s worth looking at a series of prior ideas and 
practices that explained functions, companies, corporations, and the markets in which 
they interacted. Where facilities were located, how much things cost, and who created 
them all derived from often-unspoken assumptions that the current period sometimes 
calls into question.
In our era, many elements of organizational life are in transition or are 
being subjected to multiplying possibilities:
 
 Where does work happen?
 
 Who tells people what to do?
 
 How is performance assessed, and by whom?
 
 Why do organizations exist?
 
 How is value created, stored, and exchanged?
Before we can understand how the computing and communications 
revolutions of the past quarter century are changing the shape of groups 
that perform work, it’s useful to see how those groups have been under-
stood over time.

Adam Smith’s description of pin making is borrowed from a French 
and perhaps dated source. Nevertheless, the notion of taking an indus-
trial process and letting un- or semiskilled individuals focus on discrete

process steps was clearly a step away from craft work, in which a 
relatively skilled individual was responsible for more or perhaps all 
operations.
One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, 
a fourth points it, a ﬁ fth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; 
to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it 
on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a 
trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important busi-
ness of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eigh-
teen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all 
performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will 
sometimes perform two or three of them.1
Smith asserted that 10 men could make 48,000 pins per day in con-
trast to an individual working alone, who might make between 1 and 20: 
a theoretical gain of 2,400%, at minimum.
1860–1890: Railroads and the Rise 
of Administration
A little less than a century later, railroads posed an entirely new set of 
business challenges. The broad geographic coverage of railroads neces-
sitated new institutions of both centralized control and distributed 
 execution. As one scholar put it, “The major railroad companies pio-
neered the organizational structure that has become known as ‘Big 
Business’ in the decades between 1860 and 1890, which was the organi-
zational analogue of the physical infrastructure.”2 The telegraph, a pow-
erful network in its own right, was essential for the many coordination 
tasks of railroad management, and the two technologies grew in tandem, 
often sharing rights of way.
Railroads literally invented much of modern management practice. 
Local “solar” time was impractical for system timetables, so standardized 
time zones were instituted in the 1880s. The scale of capital that had to 
be raised was so vast that ownership, often in joint-stock corporations, 
was separated from management, which had many speciﬁ c and techni-
cally sophisticated variations. Railroad management became a career track, 
entirely separate from both manual labor and the classic professions of the 
ministry, medicine, or law.3

1910: Scientiﬁ c Management and the Further 
Division of Labor
In an age characterized by labor strife, ethnic tension, and rapid indus-
trial expansion in both Europe and the United States, Frederick Winslow 
Taylor helped initiate a movement with far-reaching consequences. 
A respected authority who was invited to lecture at the newly formed 
Harvard Business School, Taylor believed that the interests of labor and 
capital could be harmonized if three root causes were addressed:
 1. Workers slowed their pace (“soldiered”) and limited output to protect 
their jobs.
 2. Management techniques were defective, forcing labor into an adver-
sarial posture.
 3. The inefﬁ ciency of rule-of-thumb planning and production methods 
limited material output.
In response, Taylor separated task conception from its execution: 
Management’s job was to ﬁ nd the “one best way” of doing a job (usu-
ally through time-and-motion studies in which task elements were broken 
down and timed with the infamous stopwatch), then to teach unskilled 
laborers that particular method. In this way, labor became fungible, and 
what later became known as “best practices” could be more uniformly 
applied. As Taylor wrote in 1911,
to work according to scientiﬁ c laws, the management must take 
over and perform much of the work which is now left to the men; 
almost every act of the workman should be preceded by one or 
more preparatory acts of the management which enable him to 
do his work better and quicker than he otherwise could. And each 
man should daily be taught by and receive the most friendly help 
from those who are over him, instead of being, at the one extreme, 
driven or coerced by his bosses, and at the other left to his own 
unaided devices.4
One key to aligning the interests of labor and capital was the piece-
rate system, in which output correlated to compensation. Such a system 
could be, and was, frequently gamed, particularly by management; “speed-
ups” and recalibration of wage scales in the face of increased performance 
were common. To see the lasting impact of Taylorism, one need only step 
into a McDonald’s, where all cooking skill is engineered into the infrastruc-
ture, albeit without the piecework pay scheme.

A Brief History of Organizational Innovation 
1930s: Alfred Sloan at General Motors
On its way to becoming the world’s largest industrial corporation, 
General Motors grew rapidly, primarily through acquisition in the early 
years. Coordination among the many operating entities was minimal as 
the entrepreneurial heads maintained owner-manager roles. At the scale 
of a loosely organized huge corporation, levels of spending could rise to 
potentially dangerous levels. In a precursor to Cisco’s record-setting $2 
billion write-down of excess networking inventory in 2001, GM suffered 
inventory losses of more than $83 million—more than $1 billion in 2010 
dollars—in 1921–1922.
In response, an engineer/entrepreneur named Alfred Sloan (who 
later became the company’s chief executive ofﬁ cer) helped create 
the divisional structure. GM automobile brands, including Cadillac, 
Oldsmobile, and Chevrolet, were structured by market price point, then 
allowed to operate relatively autonomously to coordinate supply and 
demand. Planning and forecasting grew in importance, and consumption 
data, in the form of R. L. Polk collections of automobile registrations,* 
was tied to production. GM became closely identiﬁ ed with an organi-
zational structure built on line (day-to-day operational), staff (analysis 
and oversight), and general (headquarters) management. Sloan added 
an additional reﬁ nement: interdivisional committees for such activities as 
new product development or sales. These committees themselves had 
full-time staffs.5
1937–1981: Transaction Costs
Why do ﬁ rms exist? Beginning with Ronald Coase in the 1930s and con-
tinuing through the work of Oliver Williamson, both Nobel laureates, a 
school of thought has focused on when internally organized resources 
at a ﬁ rm (such as an ofﬁ ce supply cabinet) are preferable to going to 
the market (a trip to the store to buy pencils). Traditional notions of 
price mechanisms do not apply to behavior inside a ﬁ rm: “Within a 
ﬁ rm, these market transactions are eliminated and in place of the com-
plicated  market structure with exchange transactions is substituted the 
*Polk remains an important information provider 140 years after its founding. 
Previously focused on city directories, Polk branched out into collections of auto-
mobile registrations in the 1920s. Polk later participated in the computerization of 
Vehicle Identiﬁ cation Numbers and most recently acquired the Carfax used-vehicle 
information reporting service.

89
entrepreneur-co-ordinator, who directs production.”6 Instead, a variety of 
transaction costs apply to ﬁ rms, which eventually came to be deﬁ ned as 
being related to:
 
 Search and information (location of supplier and required inventory, 
price, etc.)
 
 Bargaining costs, including both negotiation and formal contracting
 
 Policing and enforcement of the terms of the transaction7
Yet Coase’s emphasis on an entrepreneur was already dated; the rail-
roads had separated capital from management many decades earlier, and 
Sloan was then introducing at GM an extremely complex model that relied 
on various species of managers. Those managers had as their goal not 
always the proﬁ tability of the ﬁ rm but the preservation of their position, 
a trait noticed by the German sociologist Max Weber in Economy and 
Society (1922) well before Coase wrote.
The notion of transaction cost economics does have important implica-
tions for the modern organization, however. If technologies can lower the 
cost of dealing with the market, as in a browser-based self-service travel 
site, ﬁ rm-based travel resources can be freed up. At the same time, the dis-
tance of most bureaucracies from the market, and from that “entrepreneur-
coordinator” role, can lead to slow decisions, non-value-adding effort, and 
other traits that inhibit ﬁ rm performance.
1980s: Economies of Scope and Core Competencies
Economies of scale are familiar: The more a producer makes of a single 
item, the lower the cost of raw materials, production facilities and exper-
tise, and perhaps sales channels. But what happens if the producer sells 
two or more items? Here economies of scope may apply: In the words of 
one of the seminal articles of the period, “if economies of scope are based 
upon the common and recurrent use of proprietary knowhow [sic] or the 
common and recurrent use of a specialized and indivisible physical asset, 
then multiproduct enterprise (diversiﬁ cation) is an efﬁ cient way of orga-
nizing economic activity.”8
In other words, there may be economic logic in favor of a bus company 
with large parking lots and a crew of diesel mechanics starting a heavy-
truck rental business that utilizes some of the same assets. If Procter & 
Gamble already has a sales force and distribution channel to grocery and 
discount department stores in place for cleaning supplies, buying Gillette 
and its Duracell battery brand should build on the existing capabilities and 
infrastructure.

A Brief History of Organizational Innovation 
Shortly after this justiﬁ cation for diversiﬁ cation came into circula-
tion, however, business school professors Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad 
asserted the notion of core competencies, the handful of deep proﬁ cien-
cies that separate a ﬁ rm from its competitors.9 In the best-case scenario, 
a core competency is difﬁ cult to copy, can be applied across multiple 
product lines or geographies, and is experienced as a valued attribute by 
the customer. Core competencies take years or decades to develop and 
ideally become part of the organization’s culture and identity. Developing 
the depth of expertise needed for core competency, and the need for a 
long-term view, can be difﬁ cult to balance against the urge to acquire or 
otherwise diversify in pursuit of the oft-cited but seldom realized quality 
of “synergy.”
1995: Linux as “Commons-Based Peer Production”
The Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler contrasts the organizational 
model behind Linux, and later Wikipedia, against those of both individuals 
in markets and employees in ﬁ rms working for managers. His 2002 paper 
“Coase’s Penguin” bridges the worlds of software development and eco-
nomic theory, explaining the paper’s mission succinctly:
Commons-based peer production . . .   has particular advantages as 
an information process for identifying and allocating human cre-
ativity available to work on information and cultural resources. It 
depends on very large aggregations of individuals [who] self-identify 
for tasks and perform them for a variety of motivational reasons 
that I discuss at some length.10
According to Benkler, altruism is irrelevant to any discussion of why 
people contribute their labor, credibility, and other resources to such 
efforts: Commons-based peer production allows people to self-identify 
for informational or cultural questions, and the management problem that 
challenges most organizations becomes instead an exercise in editorial 
ﬁ ltering:
Peer production provides a framework within which individu-
als who have the best information available about their own ﬁ t 
for a task can self-identify for the task. This provides an informa-
tion gain over ﬁ rms and markets, but only if the system develops 
some mechanism to ﬁ lter out mistaken judgments that agents 
make about themselves. This is why practically all successful peer 
production systems have a robust mechanism for peer review or

statistical weeding out of contributions from agents who misjudge 
themselves.11
2000: Offshore
In an industrial age, manufacturing facilities needed to be placed at a 
nexus of labor, capital, and raw materials. Thus, waterpower helped 
establish New England as a center for textiles and shoemaking for a time, 
Pittsburgh became the center of steel making, and Detroit emerged at the 
core of the U.S. auto industry. As economies rely more on services, no 
longer do factories have to close in search of labor arbitrage and access to 
emerging markets for jobs to be exported. Rather, some kinds of services 
can be delivered through a wire (call centers and computer programming 
are familiar examples) while other services, such as nursing, truck driving, 
and the proverbial haircut, are destined to be delivered in person.
The line between personal and impersonal services, as the Princeton 
economist Alan Blinder has named them, does not follow class lines, as 
factory closings did. High-wage equity analysis, radiology interpretation, 
and new-product design can move to offshore locales just as easily as 
manufacturing, call center, and transcription services, each a traditionally 
low-wage position. As Blinder noted in 2006:
The fraction of service jobs in the United States and other rich 
countries that can potentially be moved offshore is certain to rise 
as technology improves and as countries such as China and India 
continue to modernize, prosper, and educate their work forces. 
Eventually, the number of service-sector jobs that will be vulnerable 
to competition from abroad will likely exceed the total number of 
manufacturing jobs. Thus, coping with foreign competition, cur-
rently a concern for only a minority of workers in rich countries, 
will become a major concern for many more.12
Looking Ahead
The evolution reﬂ ected in these few readings has wide-ranging implica-
tions for every facet of every modern society. The logic of factory location 
is completely different from that of universities, venture capital ﬁ rms, or 
data centers. Education for a lifetime of abstract cognitive work must coex-
ist with practical training for hotel and restaurant management or elemen-
tary school teaching. The life expectancy of a manual laborer, particularly 
in the presence of toxins, may or may not be different from that of ofﬁ ce

workers in the same country, particularly if the latter tend to be seden-
tary. The long-term, possibly career-long, implicit employment contract that 
held true for union automobile workers, for example, is fading to be a dis-
tant memory. Tax revenues, the lifeblood of every community, every state, 
and every major nation, are changing as a result of new work practices 
(outsourcing), wage scales, and value delivery arrangements (self-service). 
Finally, people are essentially social animals and now have at their disposal 
a variety of technologies that augment and ideally enhance that sociability.

CHAPTER 9
Firms, Ecosystems, 
and Collaboratives
The Internet and mobility are changing how resources can be organized to do 
work. The limited liability joint stock corporation remains useful for assembling capital 
at scale, which helps build railroads, steel mills, and other industrial facilities. With 
manufacturing less important in the U.S. economy in the past 50 years and new tools 
facilitating coordination and collaboration at scale without need for twentieth-century 
ﬁ rms, we are witnessing some fascinating new sizes, shapes, and types of organiza-
tions. As MIT professor Erik Brynolfsson noted in the Sloan Management Review, we 
need to rethink the very nature of ﬁ rms, beginning with Ronald Coase’s famous the-
ory: “The traditionally sharp distinction between markets and ﬁ rms is giving way to a 
multiplicity of different kinds of organizational forms that don’t necessarily have those 
sharp boundaries.”1
Emerging Nonﬁ rm Models
Rather than try to construct a typology or theory of nonﬁ rm entities, I give 
a series of examples in which people can get things done outside tradi-
tional governmental and company settings. Each of these relies on some 
combination of connectedness, mobility, data access and interrogation, 
and other attributes of the contemporary landscape.

mendously throughout human history: rich patrons, family, credit card

debt, and many forms of government funding. David Bowie issued an 
asset-backed security with the future revenue streams of the albums he 
recorded before 1990 as collateral.2 Given the decline in the audience for 
buying recorded music, Moody’s downgraded the $55 million in debt to 
one step above junk bonds. Prudential, the buyer of the notes, looks to be 
the loser here while Bowie was either smart or lucky (but hasn’t created 
much art of note since 1997, when the transaction occurred).
In 2009, a new model emerged. Kickstarter allows artists and other 
creators to post projects to which donors (not lenders) can commit. If 
I want to make an independent ﬁ lm, or catalog the works of a grafﬁ ti 
artist, or write a book, I can post the project, and any special rewards to 
funders, on the site. Donors and artists alike are protected by a threshold 
requirement: If the required sum is not raised, the project never launches. 
Kickstarter takes 5% of the funds, and Amazon payments cost another 5%. 
Once completed, the works are permanently archived on the site. The 
site attracted some notice in 2010 when a user-controlled alternative to 
Facebook, called Diaspora, raised $200,000.
Donors might receive a signed copy of the ﬁ nished work, or pdf 
updates while the work is in process, or tickets to the ﬁ lm’s premiere, or 
other reciprocation. While it’s too early to judge the longevity or scope of 
the model, TIME magazine named it one of the 50 best inventions of 2010.
Software Developer Networks
Microsoft enjoyed a huge competitive advantage in software developer 
networks in the 1990s. As of 2002, one worldwide estimate showed 
about 10 million developers in the Microsoft camp.3 None of these 
men and women was an employee but was often trained, certiﬁ ed, and 
equipped with tool sets by Microsoft. The developers, in turn, could 
sense market demand for applications large and small and build solu-
tions in the Windows environments for customers conditioned to seek out 
the Windows branding in the service provider.
More recently, the App Store model has attracted developers who seek 
a more direct path to monetization. Apple has hundreds of thousands of 
applications for the iPhone and iPad; Google’s Android platform has nearly 
as many, depending on counting methodology. Tools are still important, 
but rather than certiﬁ cation programs, the App Store model relies on the 
market for validation of an application. Obviously dry  cleaners and other 
small businesses need accounting programs, or whatever, and Google can’t 
compete with Microsoft for this slice of the  business. Even so, enterprise 
software vendors such as Adobe, Autodesk, Oracle, and SAP must navigate 
new territory as the app store model, along with software as a service (see 
Chapter 26), make such competitors as Salesforce.com and its Force.com

developer program a new kind of market entrant. Much like Apple, Force.
com allows developers to go direct to market rather than have to team up 
with conventional vendors.
The app store developers aren’t really a network in any meaningful 
sense of the word: They don’t meet, don’t know each other, don’t exist 
in a directory of members, afﬁ liates, or prospects. There are developer 
conferences, of course, but not in the same form that Microsoft pioneered. 
The networks, particular the app store developers, certainly aren’t even 
remotely an extension of Apple’s, Google’s, or HTC’s corporate organi-
zation: The market model is much more central than any organizational 
chart can be.
Not all of these developer networks play inside the lines, as it 
were. Despite robust security technologies, Sony PlayStations and Apple 
iPhones have been unlocked by third-party teams. The iPhone Dev 
Team, described by the Wall Street Journal as “a loose-knit but exclusive 
group of highly-skilled technologists who are considered to be the lead-
ers among iPhone hackers,”4 has contributed a steady stream of software 
kits for Apple customers to “jailbreak” their devices. The procedure is 
not illegal but can void certain warranty provisions. The beneﬁ t to the 
user is greater control over the device, access to software not necessarily 
approved by Apple, and sometimes features not supported by the ofﬁ cial 
operating system.
The iPhone Dev Team is so loosely organized that it functioned quite 
effectively, solving truly difﬁ cult technical challenges in elegant ways, 
even though its members did not physically meet until they were invited 
to a German hackers’ conference in 2008.
Kiva.org
Founded in 2005, Kiva.org is a nonproﬁ t microlending effort. The orga-
nization, headquartered in San Francisco, recruits both lenders and 
entrepreneurial organizations around the world. The Internet connects 
the individuals and groups that lend money to roughly 125 lending part-
ners (intermediaries) in developing countries and in the United States, 
and the lending partners disburse and collect the loans. Kiva does not 
charge any interest, but the independent ﬁ eld partner for each loan 
can charge interest.
After six years, Kiva has loaned more than $200 million, with a repay-
ment rate of 98.65%. More than 500,000 donations have come in and 
nearly 300,000 loans have been initiated, at an average size of slightly 
under $400. While the recipients often are featured on the Kiva Web 
site, lenders can no longer choose who will receive their loan, as was 
formerly the case. Still, the transparency of seeing the effect of money 
c09.indd   95

96 
Firms, Ecosystems, and Collaboratives 
for a farmer’s seeds, or a ﬁ shing boat repair, or a village water pump is 
strong encouragement to donors, so most money that people give to Kiva 
is reloaned multiple times.5
Kiva and other microﬁ nance organizations challenge the conventional 
wisdom of economic development, as embodied in large capital projects 
funded by the World Bank and similar groups. Instead of massive dams, 
for example, Kiva works at the individual or small-group level, with high 
success rates that relate in part to the emotional and economic investment 
of the people rather than a country’s elites, the traditional point of contact 
for the large aid organizations. At the same time, the scale of the macro 
aid organizations is truly substantial, and Kiva has never billed itself as a 
replacement for traditional economic development.
Even given its successes, Kiva faces substantial challenges:
 
 The quality of the local lending partners
 
 Currency risk
 
 Balancing supply and demand for microcredit at a global scale
 
 Transparency into lending partners’ practices
Still, the point for our purposes relates to $200 million in loans to 
the world’s poorest, with low overhead and emotional linkages between 
donors and recipients. Fifteen years ago such a model would have been 
impossible even to conceive.
Internet Engineering Task Force
More than a decade ago, the Boston Globe’s economics editor (yes, 
daily newspapers once had economics editors) David Warsh con-
trasted Microsoft’s pursuit of features to the Internet Engineering Task 
Force (IETF), the unique organization behind the network of networks. 
In the article, the IETF was personiﬁ ed by Harvard University’s Scott 
Bradner, a true übergeek who embraces a minimalist, functionalist per-
spective. “Which system of development,” Warsh asked, “[Bill] Gates’s or 
Bradner’s, has been more advantageous to consumers? . . .   Which tech-
nology has beneﬁ ted you more?”6 Bradner contends that, like the Oxford 
English Dictionary, the IETF serves admirably as a case study in open-
source methodology, though the people making the model work didn’t 
call it that at the time.
Companies in any realm of intellectual property, especially, should 
consider Warsh’s conclusion:
Simpler standards [in contrast to those coming from governmental 
or other bureaucratic entities that can get snarled in ego battles or 
c09.indd   96

lowest-common-denominator consensus, and in contrast to many 
proprietary standards that emphasize features over function] mean 
greater success. And it was the elegant standards of the IETF, sim-
ply written and speedily established, that have made possible the 
dissemination of innovations such as the World Wide Web and its 
browsers.
As stated on its website, the IETF’s structure and mission are straight-
forward and refreshingly apolitical:
The IETF’s mission is “to make the Internet work better,” but it 
is the Internet Engineering Task Force, so this means: make the 
Internet work better from an engineering point of view. We try to 
avoid policy and business questions, as much as possible. If you’re 
interested in these general aspects, consider joining the Internet 
Society.
A famous aspect of its mission statement commits the group to “rough 
consensus and running code.” That is, the IETF makes “standards based 
on the combined engineering judgment of our participants and our real-
world experience in implementing and deploying our speciﬁ cations.”7 
The IETF has meetings, to be sure, and a disciplined process for consider-
ing and implementing proposed changes, but, remarkably, such a power-
ful and dynamic global communications network is not “owned” by any 
corporation, government, or individual.
eBird.org
Species migration provides crucial scientiﬁ c data in many realms, not 
least of which is climate change. Bird-watchers can play a valuable role 
here, pursuing their hobby but sharing observational data with larger 
databases that can generate large-scale pattern recognition. Cornell’s Lab 
of Ornithology and the National Audubon Society teamed up in 2002 to 
build an online tool for information collection and dissemination related 
to the abundance and distribution of avian species across time and space. 
In January 2010 alone, 1.5 million bird observations were submitted in 
North America. A birder can keep his or her personal log on the site and 
use tools for visualization and other forms of analysis. Multiple languages 
are supported. Unusually and usefully, regional bird experts review all 
submissions to maintain a high level of data quality. eBird in turn sup-
ports still larger efforts, such as the Global Biodiversity Information 
Facility.8

Distributed Capital
One day a few years ago, I was having trouble with my VPN connection 
to the corporate e-mail server and the weather was unseasonably warm, 
so I took the dog for a walk around the block while the network hairball 
cleared. I did a rough count of people on the street in our small town out-
side Boston and was stunned to conclude that, not counting the retirees, 
more people had “alternative” work arrangements than conventional ones. 
Changing the names, here are the people who lived on our street:
 
 Keith has a PhD in operations research and is employed by a Wall 
Street bank doing quantitative analysis from his home ofﬁ ce. He was 
hard-wired into the mothership via a dedicated T1 line. His wife, 
Karin, ran a nonproﬁ t.
 
 Tina was and is a personal ﬁ tness trainer.
 
 Natalie ran a software company from her home. Two people worked 
for her there.
 
 Brian was a professor of engineering and grew fruit that he sold at his 
farm stand.
 
 Jim and Stephanie worked for moviemakers building sets in their 
barn/workshop and scouting locations for movie shoots.
 
 Rich left the dot-com world and sold musical instruments to schools.
 
 Greg was another sales executive, working for a technology hardware 
vendor.
Observations
First, I make no claim for this being an “average” neighborhood—the 
Boston metro area is pretty expensive to live in, and our town had grown 
more afﬂ uent than many. Even so, as a “weak signal,” this employment 
pattern is indicative of larger trends. It may be happening here earlier than 
elsewhere, and probably to a greater degree, but we’re not unique.
Second, just on our street there’s a wide spread among the service 
businesses and occupations represented. While there are a lot of classic 
“knowledge workers,” with six PhDs on the street, there are other occu-
pational types represented as well: personal training and carpentry, for 
two. The sales reps are another interesting category, and we have a classic 
entrepreneur who doesn’t hold an advanced degree.
Third, there’s a split between those who need the Internet to do what 
they do and those who could get along without it.
Finally, I realized that the difference between working at home and 
telecommuting to work somewhere else is blurring. Professors are home 
most of the day and have summers off, and while they couldn’t teach

Distributed Capital 
99
without a classroom in 2005, online learning is growing extremely fast, so 
location matters for education less than it formerly did. In addition, the ﬁ t-
ness trainer’s “shop” is wherever she is at a given time.
Getting aggregate numbers for these kinds of workers is difﬁ cult—
nobody has a good count of American distributed workers, nor is much 
international data reliable; even the label is problematic. Anecdotally, 
the trend seems to have accelerated since 1995, and it’s happening in 
many types of businesses. Because service work is often brain work, and 
because the Internet allows those people to work remotely or in a home-
based business, one outcome is that the means of production are get-
ting more decentralized. As more factories move offshore, as companies 
reevaluate their real estate holdings in an attempt to manage costs, and as 
retirees from conventional jobs ﬁ nd new types of employment after age 
60 or so, this tendency will likely accelerate. This decentralization of the 
inputs to economic output will compound the already fuzzy problem of 
measuring services productivity, as we see in Chapter 14.
The impact of this decentralization will be far-reaching. For exam-
ple, the best way to reduce trafﬁ c congestion is not to build bigger 
roads but to reduce the need to drive, whether to work or elsewhere. 
Similarly, the explosion of interest in home-schooling can be attributed 
in part to the availability of online resources and community for families 
who opt to home-school their children. According to a study done by 
the U.S. Census Bureau in 2007, there are roughly 1.5 million students 
doing home-schooling, and the annual growth rate of this student popu-
lation appears to be in the neighborhood of 15%. Finally, the availability 
of online information is changing the role and function of libraries—and 
librarians. The bottom line is that most of the people working away from 
ofﬁ ces are not one-person shops.
Implications
There are several varieties of fallout from this overall line of thinking.
MEASUREMENT First, a warning ﬂ ag should go up when talking about 
abstractions called “productivity” or “the workplace.” Services are often deliv-
ered in highly decentralized arrangements in some ways closer to the craft 
or guild model that applied before industrialization (and then mass produc-
tion) changed the scale of economic production. Measuring the inputs to ser-
vice output, particularly when they are decentralized, is difﬁ cult and perhaps 
impossible. Quantifying services output, meanwhile, remains controversial.9
INFRASTRUCTURE The emergence of powerful information networks is shift-
ing the load traditionally borne by public or other forms of  infrastructure.

Firms, Ecosystems, and Collaboratives 
The power grid, roads, schools, Internet service providers (ISPs)—all will 
be utilized differently as the capital base further decentralizes. In addition, 
given contract manufacturing, offshore programming, cloud computing, 
and more and more examples of software as a service, the infrastructure 
requirements for starting a venture have plummeted: Leadership, talent, 
and a few laptops and smartphones are often sufﬁ cient.
RETHINKING SIZE The importance of scale can at times be diminished. 
For example, Jeff Vinik didn’t need the resources of Fidelity Investments 
to run his hedge fund after he quit managing the giant Magellan mutual 
fund. In the 1950s, one reason a hotel investor would afﬁ liate with 
Holiday Inn was for access to the brand and, later, the reservations net-
work. Now small inns and other lodging providers can work word-of-
mouth and other referral channels and be proﬁ table standing alone. The 
question is how and where dispersal can work and what the center, if 
there is one, looks like.
TALENT As Linux and other developer networks grow in stature and via-
bility, managing the people who remain in traditional organizations will 
likely become more difﬁ cult. What management writer Dan Pink reason-
ably calls “the purpose motive”10 is a powerful spur to hard work: As 
grand challenges have shown, people will work for free on hard, wor-
thy problems. Outside of those settings, bureaucracies are not known for 
proving either worthy challenges or worthy purposes.
One deﬁ ning fact of many successful start-ups—Netﬂ ix, Zappos, and 
Skype come to mind—is their leaders’ ability to put proﬁ tability in the 
context of doing something “insanely great,” in the famous phrasing of 
Steve Jobs. Given alternatives to purpose-challenged cubicle-dwelling, 
more and more attractive job candidates will opt out of traditional large 
organizations. Harvard Business School and other institutions are seeing 
strong growth of a cadre of students who resist traditional employment 
and, more important, traditional motivation.11 Both nonproﬁ ts and start-
ups are challenging investment banking and consulting as destinations for 
ambitious, capable leaders of the next generation.
Looking Ahead
In the end, the purpose of a ﬁ rm, to be an alternative to market transac-
tions, is being rescaled, rethought, and redeﬁ ned. Firms will always be an 
option, to be sure, but as the examples have shown, no longer are they a 
default for delivering value. One major hint points to the magnitude of the 
shift that is well under way: Contrasted to “ﬁ rm,” the English vocabulary

CHAPTER 10
Government
Governments have signiﬁ cant interactions with the technology and communications 
domains. They tax: Wireline telephony used to be a big revenue generator. They reg-
ulate: Wireless spectrum is auctioned and regulated by several agencies. They sue: 
Overly aggressive platforms risk being targeted with antitrust litigation. Finally, they 
buy: Government is a large but idiosyncratic user of many information technologies. 
The transition from a manufacturing to services economy in the United States coin-
cides with the rise of computing, with some far-reaching implications.
Isolating how IT has shaped the economy and society turns out to be 
much less direct than looking for the impact of, say, the automobile. At 
the macro level, for about a century manufacturing surged at agriculture’s 
expense as the primary locus of employment. From 1950 until 1980, 
however, while manufacturing employment grew in raw numbers, this 
growth occurred against the backdrop of the population expansion that 
followed World War II: as a percentage of total employment, and of eco-
nomic output, manufacturing was shrinking even as it appeared to grow.
Given that the 1950–to–2000 half century was marked by a precipitous 
loss of employment as a percentage of the workforce in both agricultural 
and manufacturing arenas, we know that services have become the domi-
nant economic sector. According to the Central Intelligence Agency’s World 
Factbook, “industry” constitutes 20% of the U.S. economy while services 
add up to 79%. How could this sector grow so big so fast, and what are 
some of the implications?
For all the rhetoric about becoming a nation of burger-ﬂ ippers, gov-
ernment has become a much bigger economic entity, a major driver of 
that services sector: Prison guards, for example, constitute one of this

century’s fastest-growing occupational categories. As of 2010, there were 
more government employees—about 22 million at all levels, not count-
ing military personnel—than in all good-producing sectors combined: 
At 17 million, that group is smaller than it was in 1961 even though gross 
domestic product is about six times bigger in constant dollars.
Prison guards aside, about 80% of government jobs involve 
paperwork,* which IT can automate. Thus, it seems safe to suggest that 
one feature of the economic landscape—a large governmental economic 
presence as employer, regulator, and collector of taxes—relates closely 
to the ability of computers to collect and manage large quantities of 
information.
The impact of the computer on the U.S. economy can be partially 
attributed to its automation of government tasks. Those tasks, many of 
which escape measurement in standard indexes of economic output, are 
another legacy of the computer: If paperwork gets easier to do, more of it 
will be generated.
The Biggest Employer
Ever since World War II, the federal government has been increasing as 
an employer, either directly or indirectly. For example, seven new cabi-
net departments (plus the noncabinet Environmental Protection Agency, 
founded in 1970) date from the computer age and reﬂ ect the growing 
scope of government:
 1. Housing and Urban Development (1966)
 2. Transportation (1966)
 3. Energy (1977)
 4. Health and Human Services (1979)
 5. Education (1979)
 6. Veterans Affairs (1989)
 7. Homeland Security (2003)
Note that numbers 4 and 5 were broken out of the Department of 
Health Education and Welfare.
Headcount at these agencies is signiﬁ cant: By itself, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs employs about 280,000 people, making it both the biggest 
single federal nonmilitary organization and about the same size, by head-
count, as General Electric.
*According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, management, professional, and 
administrative support jobs represented 80.4% of federal jobs as of 2008.

The Biggest Employer 
105
In the aggregate, the U.S. federal government employed more than 
2 million people in 2010. That’s about the same employment as UPS, IBM, 
McDonald’s, Target, and Kroger combined, which means that the federal 
government, excluding armed services, employs about as many people 
as  Wal-Mart. As big as the Beltway may seem in the public imagina-
tion,  however, only about 1 in 6 federal jobs is located in the Washington, 
DC, metro area.
Finding government employment information at the state level is 
frustrating, particularly given the use of contractors. A Kentucky legisla-
tor introduced a bill in 2010 that would require the state to tally merit, 
nonmerit, and contract employees: Currently the information is difﬁ cult or 
impossible to obtain in many states, not to even mention the various local 
layers. All told, it is extremely difﬁ cult to count government and govern-
ment-related workers in the aggregate.
“Government” can be an abstract term, so I looked for concrete data 
closer to home. As a state, Pennsylvania is reasonably representative, with 
a relatively large economy (number 6 out of 50), and a per capita income 
almost perfectly at the median, ranking twenty-sixth of 50. Agriculture is 
important but not predominant, and 25 Fortune 500 companies are head-
quartered here. As of the ﬁ rst quarter of 2010, the biggest employer was 
the State of Pennsylvania. (No ﬁ gures were released in the document, com-
piled by the state Center for Workforce Information & Analysis.) Number 2 
was the U.S. government, even after the closing of the Philadelphia naval 
yard in 1995.
To continue that list of Pennsylvania’s top employers, note the paucity 
of private sector job generators:
 3. Wal-Mart
 4. City of Philadelphia
 5. University of Pennsylvania (roughly 35,000 jobs, including a big  medical 
center)
 6. Philadelphia school district
 7. Penn State University (not counting the afﬁ liated medical center)
 8. Giant Food Stores
 9. UPS
 10. University of Pittsburgh
 11. PNC Bank
 12. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
 13. State System of Higher Education (public colleges and universities 
excluding Penn State, Pittsburgh, and Temple)
 14. Weis Supermarkets
All told, 20 of the top 50 employers in Pennsylvania are not busi-
nesses in the traditional sense of the word: That’s 40% of the leaderboard,

Government
including six of the top seven. More signiﬁ cantly, Pennsylvania is ofﬁ -
cially a services economy: Only 1 employer (Merck) in the top 25 and 4 
in the top 50 make anything. Many kinds of services are represented, with 
healthcare in the lead, followed by education, grocery, retail, ﬁ nancial ser-
vices, and fast food/convenience stores.
The contrast to the intermediate past is shocking. Courtesy of 
researchers at the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, here 
are the top 25 employers of 1965 (the earliest year for which records are 
available):
 1. United States Steel
 2. Bethlehem Steel
 3. Westinghouse Electric
 4. Bell Telephone of Pennsylvania
 5. Jones & Laughlin Steel
 6. General Electric
 7. Sears, Roebuck
 8. A&P
 9. Acme Markets
 10. Western Electric
 11. Philco
 12. Budd
 13. Philadelphia Electric
 14. Boeing
 15. Crucible Steel
 16. Pittsburgh Plate Glass
 17. Allegheny Ludlum Steel
 18. Sylvania Electric
 19. Sun Oil
 20. Pittsburgh Steel
 21. Armco Steel
 22. Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa)
 23. RCA
 24. Armstrong Cork
 25. Rohm and Haas
(Note that the methodology of the 1965 list was not made clear: 
Government entities, hospitals, and universities are not listed, but the 
absence is unexplained.)
Of the 25, services are represented only by retailers and utilities: No 
banks or healthcare providers make the top 40. Seven steelmakers dom-
inate the list, joined by Alcoa. The state’s heritage in energy was still 
represented by Atlantic Reﬁ ning in Philadelphia, Sun Oil, and Gulf Oil.

Government Hiring at a Crossroads 
107
Transportation is more of a factor today, with UPS at 9 and US Airways at 
30; in 1965, no railroads made the list, even though their suppliers (Budd 
and GE) did.
The composition of the 1965 and 2010 lists illustrate several ger-
mane points with regard to the recent economic downturn. First, it’s 
hard to stay on top: Almost all companies that at one time appeared to 
be powerfully untouchable sooner or later fall by the wayside. Bell of 
Pennsylvania, the number-4 employer in 1965, morphed into Verizon, 
currently number 28. Among retailers, A&P disappeared, as did Gimbels 
and G.C. Murphy, while Sears fell from seventh to thirty-second. Second, 
in the Pennsylvania case at least, the kinds of ﬁ rms traditionally targeted 
by economic development agencies—addressing dynamic markets, pay-
ing high wages, and anchoring a community or region—are not particu-
larly large employers:
 14. Merck
 19. The Vanguard Group (headquartered outside Philadelphia)
 25. Comcast (headquartered in downtown Philadelphia)
 39. GE (which makes railroad locomotives in Erie)
Government Hiring at a Crossroads
After this historical wave of growth in hiring by governments at every 
level of U.S. society, however, data points from all over converge to 
announce a time of reckoning:
 
 According to the Pew Center on the States, the 50 states collectively 
have $3.3 trillion of pension obligations, with about a third, $1 trillion, 
unfunded.
 
 In part because the recession has reduced states’ revenues, 48 out 
of 50 states faced budget shortfalls in 2009 and 2010; 46 had gaps in 
2011. (The exceptions were resource-intensive Alaska and Montana, 
along with North Dakota and Arkansas.) The 2010 state budget short-
falls totaled $191 billion.
 
 Illinois, which ranked dead last in pension funding in 2008, was 
forced to raise taxes on individual income a full 75% in 2011. The 
state legislature also approved the issuance of $3.7 billion in bonds to 
more adequately fund pension obligations.
 
 At the University of California at Los Angeles, the dean of the 
Anderson School of Business is attempting to privatize a state 
resource. State budget cuts leave California’s support of Anderson at 
about 6 cents on the dollar. By withdrawing from the state system,

Government
Anderson can set its own tuition and pay superstar faculty superstar 
salaries, thus enhancing its ability to attract top talent.1 In all levels of 
government in the United States, the wage differential of the 1990s 
has reversed and public sector workers earn, on average, 30% more 
than private sector counterparts. In addition to being paid more, gov-
ernment workers’ healthcare, vacation time, retirement, and other 
beneﬁ ts typically are more generous than in industry.
 
 Underperformance is seldom addressed with meaningful action. 
Firing either incompetent or unaffordable public workers is far more 
difﬁ cult than doing layoffs in the private sector when companies 
or whole industries face transitions in technology, customer behav-
ior, or  competition. (According to The Economist, the Los Angeles 
school district spent $3.5 million trying to ﬁ re seven underperforming 
teachers and succeeded with only ﬁ ve.2 Insofar as the district’s entire 
teaching force numbers 33,000, the effort was aimed at 1/50th of 1%. 
By contrast, private sector organizations routinely churn the bottom 
10% of performers.)
Inevitable Downsizing
The bills are coming due on these public institutions. In the private sec-
tor, the cost of unsustainable labor arrangements, deﬁ ned as payroll costs 
out of sync with revenues, is layoffs. While Ford can claim a lot of posi-
tive news in 2011, for example, the past decade was tough: Total auto 
industry layoffs after 2006 were estimated at 200,000 jobs, and tens of 
thousands of jobs were cut at Ford earlier in the decade as well. As ser-
vices comprise more of the U.S. economy, manufacturing jobs are chang-
ing, and the big labor unions that represented these workers in the steel 
and auto heyday shrank after 1973, from about a quarter of private sector 
workers to less than a tenth in 2010.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, government 
employees, a key component of that services workforce, increased in 
union membership from 23% to roughly 38% in the 20 years following 
1973, and that membership percentage has stayed pretty constant even as 
the sector has grown dramatically. But just as the auto industry painfully 
discovered after 2000 that it could no longer afford the small-C contract 
it had agreed to with the unions in the 1950s and 1960s, governments at 
every level are facing deﬁ cits that derive substantially from labor costs (see 
Figure 10.1): Expensive pensions and expensive current workforces (with 
expensive healthcare) that often lack performance accountability are and 
will continue to be unaffordable. UBS Securities estimated in  mid-2011 that 
roughly 750,000 nonfederal government jobs could be cut in 2011–2012.3

Inevitable Downsizing 
109
In short, given a protracted employment recession (and thus a 
downturn in both taxable income and taxable spending for revenue 
generation), governments are facing truly hard choices. At the federal 
level, conservative legislators are proposing drastic cuts in the defense 
budget, previously an approach that ideology would not permit. As he 
confronted a $28 billion deﬁ cit, California governor Jerry Brown (like 
his counterparts elsewhere) proposed deep, politically and humanly 
painful cuts in the social safety net, in education (the community  college 
budget was proposed to be reduced by $400 million), and in public 
safety.
U.S. governments at every level are facing their auto industry moment. 
The Pennsylvania city of Harrisburg teeters on the edge of bankruptcy; it 
would be the biggest municipal entity to enter that process since Orange 
County in California lost billions of dollars in pension investments in 1994. 
While the likelihood of default is higher for some European nations than 
in most U.S. entities, the prospect of governments in any country default-
ing on their obligations is obviously disturbing to markets and individuals 
alike. Whether it is debt, pensions, or current expenses, governments are 
being forced to cut spending in bold strokes.

Government
Government on the Technology Landscape
What does government performance have to do with this book’s larger 
argument? The world we are in and entering is not the world that existed 
when those budgetary assumptions were being formed. The process of 
resizing government thus needs to begin with a look at what governments 
can and need to do as well as how they do it. Furthermore, there are 
tasks that at one time were essential, but technological obsolescence is 
slow to alter governments. Thus, at least ﬁ ve buckets of questions need to 
be asked—the topics under each heading are merely suggestive:
 1. What must government do, and how can other entities help deliver 
necessary services? This is a big category, obviously, but perhaps not 
as big as it once was. Funding bridges, inspecting food and oil wells, 
testing new drugs, defending the nation—lots of government tasks 
cannot go away and some may need to get bigger. At the same time, 
for-proﬁ t universities and hospitals might be better ways to approach 
some facets of education and health. At the primary and secondary 
levels, the National Home Education Research Institute asserts that 
between 1.5 and 2 million U.S. students are home-schooled. Both 
schools and homes can have their place as loci of education, but the 
fact is that in many locales, the schools are no longer good enough, 
and parents have more resources than ever to meet the need. Some 
churches have proven effective at delivering social services, though 
of course issues of evangelization and discrimination can be tricky. 
Prisons, several types of security services, school cafeterias, and many 
other functions are outsourced or even privatized; perhaps outsourc-
ing more activities should be considered.
Crowdsourcing (Internet-enabled coordination of mass volunteer 
effort; see Chapter 11) can assist government efforts. An excellent 
example is PeerToPatent.org. This joint effort of the U.S. Patent Ofﬁ ce 
and New York University’s law school enlists the power of the masses 
to assist patent examiners. Speciﬁ cally, people are asked to submit 
evidence of “prior art”—evidence that a pending patent is not in fact 
original and should not be granted protection. Given the current state 
of U.S. patent law, large-scale reform will be impossible to fund for 
the foreseeable future, so any leverage generated by the masses will 
contribute to breaking the logjam.4
 2. What can government stop doing entirely? Agricultural extension 
agents provided a valuable function in their day. Today, however, if 
a farmer sees a pest or a leaf condition, his or her ﬁ rst stop is likely 
to be the Internet. The State of California is attempting to get out of 
the incarceration business for low-level offenses, shifting responsibility

for these to the local level. Republican legislators are asking, sensibly, 
about federal support for rail transportation, which is expensive, espe-
cially when the beneﬁ ts are highly localized. Debate is increasing over 
the necessary population density to support unsubsidized high-speed 
trains; the United States lacks the crowded regions that make Japan’s 
line between Tokyo and Osaka break even.5
Telecommunications regulators were a necessary counterweight 
to a monopolistic AT&T, but now that wireline telephony participa-
tion is dropping and all segments are intensely competitive, the 
 market can do much of what 1 federal and 50 state regulators once 
did. California, to take one example, administers a billion-dollar uni-
versal service fund, dedicated, among other things, to “ensuring basic 
telephone service remains available and affordable to all Californians 
regardless of geography, language, cultural, ethnic, physical, or 
income differences”—even if fewer people than at any time in more 
than 50 years want that service.
 3. What is the right level of organization? The size of administrative units 
is typically a historical accident. Whether those units are currently the 
right size is, or should be, open for discussion. Water, sewer, ﬁ re, 
police, school, and recreational districts are rarely coherent. How big 
should a town be? When many towns are contiguous, why does each 
need a school superintendent (often with only one high school, which 
has at least one principal), a mayor and/or town manager, a chief of 
police? What is the optimum size for a school district, a ﬁ re depart-
ment, a state park in a given part of the country? Most important, what 
government entity can mandate that other units consolidate, disband, 
or otherwise change shape?
 4. How can interested parties self-organize? In the afterglow of Wikipedia’s 
tenth birthday, it’s worth asking what other efforts formerly undertaken 
by government might be better accomplished by interested citizens. 
Mash-ups are one easy example: Given good clean data (the collection 
of which remains an essential task of government), crimes, potholes, eco-
nomic opportunity, underperforming schools, and other opportunities 
for improvement can be identiﬁ ed by the people. Noise measurements 
(e.g., near wind farms) are being crowdsourced. People can also orga-
nize on the revenue side: In Mill Valley, California, a community founda-
tion has existed for nearly 30 years to supplement tax funding. To date 
the organization has raised more than $14 million—that’s a lot of bake 
sales and charity auctions. Similar parent-run organizations exist in many 
towns, and one question concerns what mobile coordination and pay-
ment platforms will mean for the future of such efforts. Entrepreneurial 
Girl Scout cookie teams are reportedly using Square (a smartphone add-
on) to process credit card transactions, for example.

 5. How can government do what it needs to do, more efﬁ ciently? IT in 
government remains a sore subject. President Obama’s former chief 
information ofﬁ cer Vivek Kundra recently put forth a 25-step plan 
to reform federal IT management.6 Many of the items are broad and 
seemingly self-evident to anyone familiar with industry (“consoli-
date data centers” and “develop a strategy for shared services”). The 
fact is, however, that industry does not follow federal acquisition or 
implementation practices; getting federal IT to perform at a reasonable 
 fraction of an Amazon or FedEx would be a massive achievement. 
Many of the most notable IT project failures of the past decade are 
government implementations: Systems development disasters at the 
U.S. Census and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are prime exam-
ples of the performance gap.
Compared to customer service in travel, banking, shopping, or 
information businesses (iTunes is an obvious example), ﬁ nding even 
basic information on most government Web sites can be painful. 
Transparency can be difﬁ cult to track down. Control of bills passing 
through legislation is a key perquisite of power, and holding up the 
process with committee hearings that happen very slowly and/or errat-
ically is common, so clear, open calendars are not always the rule. Like 
legislatures, regulatory bodies can be opaque, in that budget and head-
count information is typically difﬁ cult to obtain, unlike the information 
readily available in a private company’s annual report.
If information can be hard to ﬁ nd, the state of online transactions 
is even more dismal: Compare getting a ﬁ shing license or renewing 
other permits to checking in for an airplane ﬂ ight. While efﬁ cient gov-
ernment looks much better to citizens on the outside than to gainfully 
employed government workers on the inside of slow-moving bureau-
cracies with no incentive to improve customer service, perhaps the 
current crisis can provide the impetus for real change to commence. 
In a sector that lags private industry by many performance metrics, 
a combination of new tools and more focused motivation has the 
promise to improve service, cut costs, increase accountability, and 
enhance security.
Looking Ahead
As government at the scale of 2010 employment grows less and less 
affordable (not least of all because of the paperwork costs of health-
care for aging and retired government employees), the challenge to both 
bureaucrats and citizens will relate to information and technology at mul-
tiple levels. How can groups self-organize to accomplish things that used

to require formal entities? How can government reorganize and repriori-
tize in light of 2012 realities of telecommunications, nutrition, and water 
consumption, to take three examples? How will such cultural norms as 
trust, aging, ethnic identity, and literacy evolve after mobile phones, after 
Facebook, after the Kindle, and after WikiLeaks? President Obama spoke 
of a “Sputnik moment” for the economy at large, but perhaps the chal-
lenge could be better and more pointedly addressed to the same govern-
ment that put a man on the moon in response to the original Sputnik 
moment.

CHAPTER 11
Crowds
The Internet is remarkable for its ability for convene groups of people. These groups, 
which we will call crowds for the sake of convenience, can get work done in two basic 
ways. The ﬁ rst of these, commonly called crowdsourcing, takes big tasks and divides 
them among a large number of usually voluntary contributors. Examples would be 
Amazon Mechanical Turk or Flickr’s tagging mechanism to generate words to describe 
photos. The second function of crowds is to process information with market mecha-
nisms. This function was popularized by James Surowiecki’s book on the wisdom of 
crowds.1
Crowdsourcing: Group Effort
Perhaps the most extraordinary of Linux founder Linus Torvalds’s discov-
eries was not technical but psychological: Given a suitably hard but inter-
esting problem, distributed communities of people will work on it for free. 
The ﬁ rst decade of the twenty-ﬁ rst century has witnessed the growth of 
crowdsourcing to include several deﬁ ning artifacts of the Internet, includ-
ing Amazon, Facebook, Flickr, and Wikipedia.
Crowds can do amazing things. England’s Guardian newspaper was 
playing catch-up to the rival Telegraph, which had a four-week head start 
analyzing a mass of public records related to an expense-account scan-
dal in the House of Lords. Once it obtained the records, the Guardian 
could not wait for its professional reporters to dig through 2 million pages 
of documentation and still publish anything meaningful. The solution was 
to crowdsource the data problem: Let citizen-readers look for nuggets of 
meaningful information.

Crowds
Twenty thousand volunteers assisted, digging through more than 
170,000 documents in 80 hours. Net cost to the newspaper: £50 for tempo-
rary server rental (from Amazon) and less than two person-weeks to build 
the site. By making the hunt for juicy news bits into a game— complete 
with leaderboards—and making feedback easy, as well as by spicing up 
the game by using politicians’ headshots, the Guardian helped build 
reader identiﬁ cation with the paper at the same time it found investigative 
threads for further follow-up.2
Recent scholarship has identiﬁ ed four challenges to successful 
crowdsourcing:
 1. How are participants recruited and retained?
 2. What contributions do participants make?
 3. How are contributions combined into solutions to a given problem?
 4. How are users and their contributions evaluated?3
By sorting along these dimensions, several buckets of crowdsourcing 
emerge.
Evaluating
The simplest tactic is to ask people for their opinion. Amazon product 
reviews were an important step, but then the site went a step further and 
asked people to review the reviews. Netﬂ ix uses viewer feedback to rec-
ommend movies for both the reviewer and for people who share simi-
lar preferences. eBay’s reputational currency—have buyer and seller been 
trustworthy in past transactions—is a further use of crowds as evaluators. 
Rotten Tomatoes builds movie reviews off user ratings.
More recently, Digg and Technorati have reﬁ ned the evaluation 
 function to rate larger bodies of content, including news items. In addition, 
with the tagging function, Delicious helped pioneer the evaluation as clas-
siﬁ cation: Rather than merely saying I like it, or I like it 6 stars out of 10, 
 tagging uses masses of community input to say, of a photo, that’s a sunset, 
or of a news story, that’s about product recalls. Flickr’s community had 
generated 20 million unique tags as of early 2008; by 2011, the site hosted 
more than 5 billion images. In contrast to rigid, formal taxonomies, such 
people-powered “folksonomies” are excellent examples of “good-enough” 
solutions: Unlike the Library of Congress cataloging system, for example, 
which is costly, authoritative, and cannot scale without expensive people 
with esoteric skills, there are no “right” or “wrong” tags on Flickr, only 
more and less common ones. Crowdsourcing scales to absolutely huge 
sizes, as we see soon. The behavioral patterns, at scale, of anonymous 
evaluators are also unpredictable and merit considerable further study.

Crowdsourcing: Group Effort 
117
Sharing
Through a variety of platforms, it has become trivially easy to share 
information with groups of any size, reaching into the hundreds of mil-
lions. The original sharing architecture at scale was probably Napster, in 
which the material that was shared belonged to other people. Since then, 
YouTube, Flickr, and blogging tools have expanded the range of possibil-
ity beyond words to images and video. An incredible 48 hours of video 
are uploaded to YouTube every minute as of mid-2011, up from half that 
sum one year prior. On the downstream side, YouTube records 3 billion 
page views every day.4
More substantive knowledge can also be shared. Such idea-gathering 
and problem-solving sites as Innocentive and NineSigma pose hard busi-
ness and engineering problems on behalf of such clients as Eli Lilly 
and Procter & Gamble. The power is in a very small number of people 
who can speak to the issue, not a mass of worker bees. More recently, 
Quora launched a question-based site that is hybrid of broad- and 
 narrow-casting: Expertise self-selects and answers are voted up or down 
by subsequent readers. Anyone can post any question, but getting experts’ 
attention is something of an art form. The richness of the conversations, 
across an amazing variety of topics, is stunning, and to date no money 
changes hands.
Creativity is a further category of sharing. Threadless solicits T-shirt 
design ideas and prints and sells the most popular ones. Quirky crowd-
sources new product development, soliciting both original ideas and inﬂ u-
ential changes to those concepts. Both iStockphoto and Flickr get the 
work of photographers into the hands of massive audiences. In all cases, 
recognition is one major currency of motivation.
Networking
Compare, for a moment, Facebook to Yahoo of 1998. What, really, does 
Facebook deliver? In contrast to free e-mail, horoscopes, weather, classiﬁ ed 
ads, maps, stock quotes, and an abundance of other content, Facebook 
builds only an empty lattice, to be populated with the life histories, opin-
ions, photos, and interactions of its 600 million-plus members. LinkedIn, 
MySpace (for a time), Orkut, and the rest of the social networking sites can  
also be viewed through the lens of crowdsourcing. That is, they answer 
the four questions with a compelling combination of good engineering, 
chutzpah (regarding privacy), networked innovation (in games and chari-
table contributions especially), editorial and related rule setting, and, most 
 crucially, major network effects: The more of my friends who join, the 
more compelled I am to become a member.

Crowds
Building
Linux and Wikipedia possess a structure that separates them from other 
types of sites. By building an “architecture of participation,” to use the tech-
nical publisher Tim O’Reilly’s apt phrase,5 these efforts have shown the way 
for what Harvard law professor Yochai Benkler (see Chapter 8) has called 
“commons-based peer production.”6 Nobody is “in charge,” in that tasks are 
taken up voluntarily in response to self-identiﬁ ed needs. Multiple efforts 
might be directed at the same issue, making crowdsourcing “wasteful” of 
resources when viewed from a traditional managerial perspective. As we 
saw in regard to long tails, however, there is room in these participatory 
architectures for both heavy contributors and extremely casual ones.
Much like natural selection, competing solutions can be compared 
or possibly interbred to create “offspring” with the best characteristics 
of the previous-generation donor ideas. When Darwinian struggle does 
ensue (check the Wikipedia edits history for some sense of how vigor-
ous these contests can be), the overall intellectual quality of the effort is 
usually the winner. The quality of Linux, particularly in the domains most 
valued by its user-builders—robustness and security—testiﬁ es to the magic 
of the crowdsourced approach.
A different approach to writing code is to turn it into a game, spe-
ciﬁ cally a contest. TopCoder takes software tasks and breaks them into 
chunks, with speciﬁ c performance criteria. Prize money goes to the top 
two entries in most cases. Importantly, a subsequent contest for the com-
munity, which currently numbers more than 300,000, is to test the winning 
code. Programmers compete not just for money but also (yet again) peer 
recognition. In a classic two-sided platform play, TopCoder attracks both 
talented programmers but also top-shelf clients including NASA, Eli Lilly, 
and the National Security Agency. Such interest comes because the model 
works: Defects run well below the industry average while project comple-
tion is about 50% faster.7
Grunt Work
Finally, crowds can do mundane tasks in networks of undifferentiated 
contributors. The SETI@home project, in which computing cycles were 
harvested from screen savers to chug through terabytes of radiotelegraphic 
space noise in the search for life outside earth, is crowdsourcing of peo-
ple’s computers. The zombie-bot networks of exploited machines that 
generate spam or denial-of-service attacks constitute a dark-side example 
of crowdsourcing, albeit involuntary.

playing automaton with a human hidden inside) delegates what it calls

HITs: Human Intelligence Tasks. Naming the subjects of a photograph is a 
classic example, as is scanning aerial photographs for traces of wreckage, 
as when the noted balloonist and pilot Steve Fossett crashed in Nevada.8 
The Guardian example noted earlier shows how random volunteers, 
needing no special expertise or creativity, can help parse large data sets.
Grunt work can be fun, for the right people. Scientists at the 
University of Washington have helped create a 3-D online game called 
Foldit to apply human ingenuity, at a mass scale, to protein folding prob-
lems: People, it turns out, are better at spatial reasoning than computers. 
(See Figure 11.1.) Before drugs can be designed, the crystal structure of 
the target must be understood. In 2011, the game helped solve the struc-
ture of a protein that is related to the AIDS virus. Three different play-
ers made key contributions on which the research team could build. The 
structure of the M-PMV retroviral protease had been a mystery for roughly 
a decade; the gamers helped solve it in 16 days.9
Information Markets and Other Crowd Wisdom
Crowds also can accomplish work through market mechanisms. We’ve 
seen markets process information for a long time: When the National 
Basketball Association addressed the scandal surrounding its referee

Tim Donaghy*, the situation highlighted the secrecy with which the league 
assigns refs to games. Referees are prohibited from telling anyone but 
immediate family about travel plans, because the Las Vegas point spread 
moves if the refereeing crews are revealed ahead of game time. That point 
spread is a highly nuanced information artifact of a market compensating 
for new information about relevant inputs to the outcome of a game.
Information markets hold great potential but, like real markets, suffer 
from bubbles, information asymmetry, and other externalities. Nevertheless, 
such exemplars as Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) (now owned by 
ﬁ nancial information giant Cantor Fitzgerald), the Iowa Electronic Markets 
(IEM) for political futures, and start-ups like Fluid Innovation are leading 
the way toward wider implementation.
It seems clear that U.S. ﬁ nancial markets suffered an extended after-
math of an inﬂ ated mortgage-products market, but it turns out that 
ﬁ nancial scholars can’t agree on what a bubble is. According to Cornell 
University’s Maureen O’Hara in the Review of Financial Studies,10 the “less 
controversial” approach is to follow one scholar’s mild assertion that “bub-
bles are typically associated with dramatic asset price increases, followed 
by a collapse.” Begging the question of what constitutes a collapse, the 
issue for our purposes concerns the potential for bubble equivalents in 
information markets. It’s worth discussing some of the larger issues.
How Do Crowds Express Wisdom or, to Use a Less Loaded 
Phrase, Process Information?
Several ways of processing information come to mind. In many cases, 
crowdsourcing and information markets overlap when enough tags have 
been contributed, or enough votes tabulated, to give the recommendation 
the weight of an informal market mechanism:
 
 Voting, whether ofﬁ cially in the process of politics, or unofﬁ cially with 
product reviews, Digg or similar feedback (“Was this review helpful?”). 
All of these actions are voluntary and unsolicited, making statistical 
signiﬁ cance a moot point.
 
 Surveys, constructed with elaborate statistical tools and focused on 
carefully focused questions. Interaction among respondents is usually 
low, making surveys useful in collecting independent opinions.
* Tim Donaghy resigned from his position as a National Basketball Association ref-
eree when it was found that he had bet on games he ofﬁ ciated (and whose out-
come he presumably affected). He later served time in federal prison for his role 
in a larger betting scandal.

121
 
 Convened feedback, a catch-all that includes tagging, blogs and 
comments, message boards, trackbacks, wikis, and similar vehi-
cles. Once again, the action is voluntary, but the ﬁ eld of play is 
unconstrained. Compared to the other three categories, convened 
 feedback can contain substantial noise, but its free form allows 
topics to emerge from the group rather than from the pollster, mar-
ket maker, or publisher.
 
 Betting, the putting of real (as at IEM) or imagined (at HSX) currency 
where one’s mouth is. Given the right kind of topic and the right 
kind of crowd, this process can be extremely powerful, albeit with 
constrained questions. We will focus on the market process for the 
remainder of our discussion.
What Kinds of Questions Best Lend Themselves to 
Group Wisdom?
On this topic of targets for collective information processing Surowieki is 
direct: “Groups are only smart when there is a balance between the infor-
mation that everyone in the groups shares and the information that each 
of the members of the group holds privately.” Conversely, “what happens 
when [a] bubble bursts is that the expectations converge.”11 In contests 
and other group effort scenarios such as those noted earlier, bubbles are 
less of an issue, but markets as processing mechanisms appear to have 
this particular weakness.
Cass Sunstein, a University of Chicago law professor when he wrote 
it, agrees in his book Infotopia.12 He states: “This is the most fundamental 
limitation of prediction markets: They cannot work well unless investors 
have dispersed information that can be aggregated.” Elsewhere in a blog 
post he notes that in an informal experiment with University of Chicago 
law professors, the crowd came extremely close to the weight of the horse 
that won the Kentucky Derby, did “pretty badly” on the number of lines 
in Shakespeare’s Antigone, and performed “horrendously” when asked the 
number of Supreme Court invalidations of state and federal law. He spec-
ulates that markets employ some self-selection bias: “[P]articipants have 
strong incentives to be right, and won’t participate unless they think they 
have something to gain.”13
The best questions for prediction markets, then, involve issues about 
which people have formed independent judgments and on which they are 
willing to stake a ﬁ nancial and/or reputational investment. It may be that 
the topics cannot be too close to one’s professional interests, as the ﬁ nan-
cial example would suggest, and in line with the accuracy of the HSX 
Oscar predictions, which traditionally run about 85%.

Where Is Error Introduced?
The French political philosopher Condorcet (1743–1794) originally for-
mulated the jury theorem that explains the wisdom of groups of people, 
when each individual is more than 50% likely to be right. Bad things hap-
pen when people are less than 50% likely to be right, however, at which 
time crowds then amplify error.
Numerous experiments have shown that group averages suffer when 
participants start listening to outside authorities or to each other. What 
Sunstein called “dispersed information” and what Surowiecki contrasts to 
mob behavior—independence—is more and more difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd. Many 
of the start-ups in idea markets include chat features—they are, after all, 
often social networking plays—making for yet another category of echo 
chamber.
Another kind of error comes when predictions ignore randomness. 
Particularly in thickly traded markets with many actors, the complexity 
of a given market can expose participants to phenomena for which there 
is no logical explanation—even though many will be offered. As Nassim 
Nicholas Taleb pointed out in The Black Swan, newswire reports on market 
movement routinely and fallaciously link events and price changes: It’s not 
uncommon to see the equivalent of both “Dow falls on higher oil prices” 
and “Dow falls on lower oil prices” headlines during the same day.14
Varieties of Market Experience
Some of the many businesses seeking to monetize prediction markets are 
listed next.
 
 Newsfutures (now Lumenogic) makes a business-to-business play, 
building internal prediction markets for the likes of Eli Lilly, the 
Department of Defense, and Yahoo.
 
 Spigit sells as enterprise software to support internal innovation and 
external customer interaction. Communities are formed to collect 
and evaluate new ideas.
 
 Intrade is an Irish ﬁ rm that trades in real money (with a play money 
sandbox) applied to questions in politics, business (predictions on 
market share are common), entertainment, and other areas. The busi-
ness model is built on small transaction fees on every trade.
 
 Other prediction markets or related efforts focus on sports. YooNew 
was a futures market in sports tickets that suffered in the aftermath of 
the 2008 credit crunch. Hubdub used to be a general-purpose predic-
tion market but it has since tightened its focus.

Looking Ahead 
123
Apart from social networking plays and predictions, seemingly triv-
ial commitments to intellectual positions work elsewhere. Sunstein’s more 
recent book, called Nudge, was coauthored with the Chicago behavioral 
economist Richard Thaler.15 It points to the value of commitment for such 
personal behaviors as weight loss or project fulﬁ llment. For example, a 
PhD candidate, already hired as a lecturer at a substantial discount from 
an assistant professor’s salary, was behind on his dissertation. Thaler made 
him write a $100 check at the beginning of every month a chapter was 
due. If the chapter came in on time, the check was ripped up. If the work 
came in late, the $100 went into a fund for a grad student party to which 
the candidate would not be invited. The incentive worked, notwithstand-
ing the fact that $400 or $500 was a tiny portion of the salary differen-
tial at stake. A Yale economics professor who lost weight under a similar 
game has cofounded stickK.com, an ad-funded online business designed 
to institutionalize similar “commitment contracts.” These commitments are 
a particular form of crowdsourcing, to be sure, but the combination of 
both real and reputational currencies with networked groups represents a 
consistent thread with more formal market mechanisms.
Looking Ahead
It’s clear that crowds can in fact be smart when the members don’t listen 
to each other too closely. It’s also clear that ﬁ nancial and/or reputational 
investment are connected to both good predictions and fulﬁ lled commit-
ments. Several other issues are less obvious. Is there a novelty effect with 
prediction markets? Will clever people and/or software devise ways to 
game the system, similar to short-selling in ﬁ nance or sniping on eBay? 
What do prediction bubbles look like, and what are their implications? 
When are crowds good at answering questions and when, if ever, are they 
good at posing them? (Note that on most markets, individuals can ask 
questions, not groups.) Can we reliably predict whether a given group will 
predict wisely?
At a larger level, how do online information markets relate to older 
forms of group expression, particularly voting? In the United States, the 
ﬁ ltration of a state’s individual votes through the winner-take-all Electoral 
College is already controversial (currently only Maine and Nebraska allot 
their votes proportionately), and so-called National Popular Vote legisla-
tion has been in states with 77 electoral votes—not yet enough to overturn 
the current process. Will some form of prediction market or other crowd 
wisdom accelerate or obviate this potential change?
Any process that can, under the right circumstances, deliver such 
powerful results will surely have unintended consequences. The controversy

over John Poindexter’s Futures Markets Applied to Prediction (FutureMAP) 
program, which was canceled by DARPA* in July 2003, will certainly not 
be the last of the tricky issues revolving around this class of tools.16
As blogging, social networking, and user-generated content prolifer-
ate, we’re seeing one manifestation of a larger trend toward delegitimiza-
tion of received cultural authority. Doctors are learning how to respond to 
patients with volumes of research, expert and folk opinion, and a desire 
to dictate rather than receive treatment. Instead of trusting politicians, pro-
fessional reviewers, or commercial spokespeople, many people across the 
world are putting trust in each other’s opinions: Zagat is a great example 
of “expert” ratings systems being challenged by masses of uncredentialed, 
anonymous diners.
Zagat also raises the issue of when crowds can be “wise,” cannot 
possibly be “wise,” or generally do not matter one way or the other: For 
all the masses of opinions coalescing online, at the end of the day, how 
many serve any purpose beyond ampliﬁ ed venting? At the same time, 
businesses are getting more skilled in harvesting the wisdom of crowds, 
so while there will always be anonymous noise, mechanisms are emerging 
to collect the value of people’s knowledge and instincts.

CHAPTER 12
Mobility
By looking at the ways that mobile phones and data devices are transforming develop-
ing economies, a contrast with more familiar patterns can emerge. While convenience, 
social needs, and an extension of  desktop computing patterns can be observed in 
the United States and other locales in the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD), in Kenya, the devices, payment processes, and applica-
tion portfolio can differ signiﬁ cantly. In what is being termed “frugal innovation” or 
“reverse innovation,” the developing countries are pioneering new uses and mental 
frameworks, showing more mature markets the way forward on critical axes such as 
disaster responsiveness.
Bottom Up
It’s easy to look at the worldwide adoption of the mobile phone in quan-
titative terms and be amazed. The speed with which literally billions 
of the world’s poorest people have gained access to or even possession of 
mobile telephony and then data services is staggering. In the late 1990s, it 
was commonplace to say “half the world has never made a phone call.” 
That might have been true in 1985, but by 2000, it was nonsense. Even so, 
United Nations’ Secretary General Koﬁ  Annan said so. So did Al Gore, HP 
chief executive Carly Fiorina, and AOL founder Steve Case.
As Clay Shirky pointed out in a terriﬁ c essay from 2002, however, 
such assertions ignored truly explosive growth, ﬁ rst in land lines then in 
cellular: “[H]alf again as many land lines were run in the last 6 years of 
the 20th century as were run in the whole previous history of telephony.”

Growth in a Connected World

Mobility
That’s a lot. But mobile phones were growing far faster: a tenfold (1,000%) 
increase in the ﬁ ve years ending in 2000.1 That near billion then multiplied 
another ﬁ ve times in the following 10 years: That’s an estimated 5  billion 
mobile phones on a planet of roughly 6.8 billion. India alone added 
128 million subscribers—in one year.2 The macro situation is summarized 
in Figure 12.1.
The infrastructure is keeping pace with the handsets: According to the 
International Telecommunications Union (ITU), 90% of the world’s pop-
ulation has cellular coverage. Even Africa, at 50% coverage of the rural 
population, has grown from 20% only seven years earlier.3 This is astound-
ing growth: Again according to the ITU, “in 1985, some three billion peo-
ple, or around half of the world’s population, lived in economies with 
a teledensity (telephone lines per 100 inhabitants) of less than one. The 
global average teledensity was around seven.”4 Now there are about as 
many telephone connections as there are people, which is not the same 
as saying those connections are equally distributed. Even so, the planet 
has reached 100% teledensity, statistically anyway.
Three key business innovations helped facilitate this rapid growth. First, 
the lack of credit and banking structures for billions of people precluded 
adoption of the post-paid model, in which the carrier gives the subscriber 
credit up front and (ideally) collects bills based on use after the fact. Prepaid 
phones allowed users to pay “by the drink” and reduced credit risk for the 
carriers. Mom-and-pop convenience stores allow users to top-up minutes, 
multiplying the reach of the carrier beyond expensive company stores.

Bottom Up 
129
Second, the price of handsets was often subsidized in the West by 
long-term contracts: A Verizon cell phone might be only $40, but the 
two-year service contract, at (say) $50 per month means that the product/
service bundle will cost the customer $1,240 over the life of the contract. 
That leaves plenty of pricing ﬂ exibility to sell the $40 handset at a loss. 
With the recognition of the size of the prepaid markets in such popu-
lous countries as Brazil, India, and Mexico, handset manufacturers were 
spurred by two factors: the size of the market for low-price phones and 
tough competition from each other. Motorola, to take one example, lost 
signiﬁ cant market share to South Korean companies in the early 2000s; 
Nokia, which sells well in the developing world, lost the smartphone 
market to Apple and the Google Android coalition a few years later. For 
both reasons, along with Chinese manufacturing costs and expertise, car-
riers in the developing world can offer low-cost handsets for a reasonable 
percentage of per capita monthly income. The Chinese ﬁ rm Huawei also 
aggressively targeted the carrier equipment market, winning market share 
from Sweden’s Ericsson for cellular transmission equipment.5
Finally, monthly subscription or per-minute prepaid charges dropped 
substantially in the face of competition. For many countries accustomed to 
government-sanctioned (or-run) telecom ﬁ rms, the introduction of com-
petition involved some cognitive dissonance, but prices in country after 
country dropped steeply after a second or third wireless carrier entered 
(or was allowed to enter) the market. Other entrants, in the form of 
wholesalers, helped lower costs as they helped network owners pay off 
capital investment as well as serve additional market segments.
But rather than look at teledensity and similar numbers, it’s important 
to understand the qualitative differences that this rapid adoption of mobil-
ity is introducing. Jenny Aker and Isaac Mbiti undertook a systematic study 
titled “Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa” in 2010. They 
identify several mechanisms of impact, which I adapt slightly here.
 
 Mobile phones can improve access to and use of information, thereby 
reducing search costs, improving coordination among agents, and 
increasing market efﬁ ciency.
 
 This increased communication should improve ﬁ rms’ productive efﬁ -
ciency by allowing them to better manage their supply chains.
 
 Mobile phones create new jobs to address demand for mobile-related 
services, thereby providing income-generating opportunities in rural 
and urban areas.
 
 Mobile phones can facilitate communication among social networks 
in response to shocks, thereby reducing households’ exposure to risk.
 
 Mobile phone-based applications and development projects— 
sometimes known as m-development—have the potential to facilitate 
the delivery of ﬁ nancial, agricultural, health, and educational services.6

Mobility
Search Costs
Given the high degree of information asymmetry in the developing world, 
getting buyers and sellers on the same page can have substantial ben-
eﬁ ts. For agricultural goods, taking grain to market on foot or over long 
distances generally precluded bargaining: The price discovery effort was 
so great that hauling the crop home to wait for a better price was gener-
ally impractical. Simply being able to know the price before setting out 
is a signiﬁ cant advancement. Labor can be hired more efﬁ ciently as well, 
with faster responsiveness to changing conditions than can be achieved 
through newspapers, for example.
A Harvard economist found far-reaching beneﬁ ts for the use of mobile 
phones in Indian sardine markets. Offshore, the ﬁ shermen had to commit 
to a port for fuel reasons without knowing the price or even if a buyer 
and ice would be available. If the ﬁ sherman guessed wrong, ﬁ sh were 
dumped into the water at the port. An estimated 5% of the catch was 
wasted outright, and most ﬁ shermen sailed in and out of only one port 
even though multiple ﬁ sh markets operated in a nine-mile range.
With the introduction of basic cell phone service around the turn of 
the twenty-ﬁ rst century, markets worked signiﬁ cantly better. Thirty-ﬁ ve 
percent of ﬁ sherman sailed to alternate ports once they got conﬁ rmation 
of a buyer. Fishermen’s proﬁ ts went up 8% while consumer prices fell 4%, 
presumably because the surplus ﬁ sh were not wasted as often. Reduction 
in information asymmetry resulted in much closer pricing at markets up 
and down the coast. Better communication made one particular ﬁ shery 
market work better, and similar examples can be found in many develop-
ing economies.7
Supply Chain Efﬁ ciency
When the McKinsey Global Institute sought to explain the extraordinary 
growth in U.S. productivity between 1995 and 2000, technology in and 
of itself was difﬁ cult to isolate as a driver. Coupled with managerial inno-
vation, however, such technologies as bar code scanning, electronic data 
interchange, and warehouse management software led to Wal-Mart and its 
supplier network helping to generate a substantial portion of that produc-
tivity increase. With 27% market share in the mid-1990s and a 48% pro-
ductivity advantage over its peers, Wal-Mart’s overall impact moved the 
aggregate U.S. productivity needle all by itself.8
While it’s early and the large-scale managerial innovation for develop-
ing world supply chains is still primarily in the future, some examples are 
already showing up:

Mobile Phone Industry Impact 
131
 
 In India, mobile phone calls are valuable even when the recipient 
does not pick up. The “missed call”* message on the phone conveys 
ample information at no cost since a call was not completed. When a 
businessman ﬁ nishes a meeting, for example, he calls the taxi driver 
who had dropped him and waited, who does not answer but knows 
to pull the car to the front door of the meeting place.

with high carbon dioxide footprints and strong civic awareness.9 
Given that supply chains in South America include burros to take 
goods into poor neighborhoods, for example, overlaying social net-
works with logistics networks might work in some cities.
 
 Surveys in Africa found that something as simple as ordering replen-
ishment of dwindling supplies via mobile phone should improve the 
percentage of stockouts in both consumer and business-to-business 
transactions. In addition, in line with the search costs mentioned ear-
lier, low-cost suppliers are more easily identiﬁ ed, particularly by small 
business owners. Previously, replenishment often required travel to 
place an order. Finally in the world of small services business, many 
types of tradespeople found that 24-hour access was an important 
facet of their business.10
Mobile Phone Industry Impact
Just as the wireline telephone companies were often dominant players 
in their countries’ economies, wireless companies generate notewor-
thy impact in the countries in which they operate. Wireless providers 
in Kenya, for example, employ more than 3,000 people directly.11 In 
Senegal, while wireless ofﬁ cially employed only 415 people in 2007, 
30,000 people worked in Internet cafés, call centers, and the like.12 In 
addition, building a wireless network often requires capital investment in 
power generation and transmission, wireline backhaul networks, roads, 
rights-of-way, cell towers, billing and switching centers, and/or satellite 
uplinks. New businesses need legal determinations, business loans, real 
estate, and other services. The sum of all those categories of impact will

Mobility
certainly have increased in the intervening years in many developing 
countries.
Once again, numbers, even when available, do not tell the whole 
story. Mobile phones are changing the role of women in economies across 
the world, as when some daring Saudi Arabian women took to the roads 
in June 2011, driving cars as a form of social protest. Just as groups of 
women play a leading role in microﬁ nance, they often help organize and 
run phone-sharing businesses in rural villages.13 In Bangladesh, 50,000 
women were estimated to make their living as “phone ladies” in 2002, a 
number that grew to 220,000 by 2008.14
Even in the poorest countries, a support industry for mobile phones 
has emerged. Given the low penetration of electricity, for example, enter-
prising businesses have emerged to charge mobile phones by transporting 
them to nearly villages or by building charging stations from car batteries 
or other apparatuses. Repairing is another frequent business opportunity: 
The hacking skill of a street vendor is often impressive, particularly when 
many mobile devices are designed not to be repaired, much less by some-
one who’s possibly illiterate, self-taught, and lacks access to factory tools, 
software, and documentation. Whole physical shopping areas have emerged 
for a wide variety of mobile-related services in such cities as Kabul, Cairo, 
Mumbai, and elsewhere.15
Risk Mitigation
Aker and Mbiti say little other than that mobility helps reinforce the vitality of 
kinship networks, which has important roles for both the economy and soci-
ety of many African countries. Hearing about impending weather would be 
another example for mobility-conferred advantage for farmers or other peo-
ple exposed to the elements. Informal reference checks (“Does this person 
show up for work reliably?” “Does this customer pay her bills on time?”) can 
become practical only in a mobile environment, particularly when written lit-
eracy may be limited. Penn State University’s WishVast project in Kenya is an 
example of trying to use mobility to increase trust among potential economic 
participants who may lack kinship connections but wish to do business.16
Kinship networks in migratory cultures use mobility in complex ways. 
Women who grew accustomed to a certain degree of freedom while male 
heads of households left home for seasonal work, for example, now often 
have mobile phones with no balance—and thus no outbound calling—on 
which they get calls from the physically absent but emotionally very pres-
ent male.17 Mobile communications is changing gender relations in many 
other ways as well, as we will see.

Transparency can do more than help families and householders. The 
prospect of election monitoring, for example, should decrease corruption, 
ideally improving the place of the rule of law, enforceability of contracts, 
and other preconditions for economic advancement. Ushahidi, Swahili 
for “witness,” is an open-source mapping and coordination platform ﬁ rst 
used in the 2008 Kenyan elections but since adapted to a wide variety 
of crisis-monitoring applications. In Mexico, for example, it was the basis 
for a vote fraud-monitoring tool called Cuidemos el Voto, or “Let’s protect 
the vote together.” Ushahidi has also been deployed in Haiti, in Japan, 
and in various countries during the swine ﬂ u outbreak. Wired applications 
would never have had the same impact or the same portability.
Similarly, controversy surrounds the role of mobile phones in the so-
called Arab Spring of 2011, when 11 countries experienced major protests, 
civil uprisings, or a change of regime in the span of only six months or 
so. The Egyptian unit of Vodafone, through its advertising agency JWT, 
posted a video claiming it was the catalyst for the uprising that culminated 
in the removal of President Hosni Mubarak. Egyptian radicals claimed in 
response that political factors were far more important than any commer-
cial representations of what JWT called “Our Power.”18 The issues are big 
and complicated, but in short, to say that mobile phones aid in risk mitiga-
tion only at the household level understates the case.
Apps for Change*
As The Economist clearly pointed out, mobility is making a bigger differ-
ence in the developing world than it is in OECD countries, where it is 
far from trivial. But rather than Facebook, photo-sharing, or Angry Birds, 
the apps that matter in Africa, India, and elsewhere affect life expectancy, 
income per household, and the survival of democracy. In these areas, 
innovation in Africa and elsewhere is actually outpacing what is possible 
where more established alternatives to mobility—such as clinics, branch 
banks, or long-standing rule of law—have become part of the landscape. 
Indeed, a wide body of thought and practice is springing up around 
the notion of “reverse innovation” or its relative, “frugal innovation,” in 
which new products and services are designed for the special needs of 
emerging markets rather than being old, stripped-down, or ill-ﬁ tting ver-
sions of offers ﬁ rst seen in the United States, wealthy parts of Australasia,

or Europe.19 Reverse innovation need not involve telecommunications—
important new marketing practices involve smaller packaging for soap, 
for example—but clearly some exciting possibilities ride on the wireless 
airwaves.
The entire notion of a semiopen platform on which third-party appli-
cations can be developed is new; before 2008, getting software onto a 
cellular carrier’s devices was difﬁ cult. Revenue sharing, security, band-
width limitations, time to market, and a lack of unifying standards meant 
that few start-ups dared develop for the mobile phone or, more precisely, 
dozens of them: Button location, screen size and resolution, programming 
language, and localization of language and currency posed daunting tech-
nical problems even before questions of revenue, marketing, sales, and 
customer service were brought into the discussion.
Even without looking at the smartphone application explosion on 
Android and Apple, clever use of text messaging and other rudimentary 
data tools is making possible substantial gains in many areas: Most mobile 
phones in the developing world lack large screens and powerful data 
capabilities, as do the carrier networks in the latter instance. Two exam-
ples follow.
Mobile Money
Mobile ﬁ nancial applications, commonly known as m-money or m- banking, 
came to market in 2005 in several developing countries. Speciﬁ cs vary: The 
application might come from a mobile carrier, a bank, or a joint effort; it 
might allow international money transfers or not; payment and storage of 
value options vary. According to Mobile Money Live, 20 million people in 
developing countries should have access by 2012.20
The basic functionality generally allows mobile subscribers or banking 
customers to store value in an account accessible by the handset, convert 
cash in and out of the stored value account, and transfer value between 
users by using a set of text messages, menu commands, and personal 
identiﬁ cation numbers (PINs).
As with Ushahidi, Kenya is leading the way. Safaricom’s M-Pesa 
mobile money program launched in 2007,* with rapid uptake: About two 
years later, roughly 40 percent of Kenyans had already used the service 
to send or receive money. A popular feature is remittance from Kenyans 
abroad: M-Pesa allows someone in England, say, to send part of his or her

paycheck home, at rates lower than Western Union, with greater coverage. 
Within Kenya, M-Pesa charged roughly 60% less than the post ofﬁ ce for a 
simple transfer.
According to the carrier, in only two years, the cumulative value 
of the money transferred via M-Pesa was over $3.7 billion—nearly 
10  percent of Kenya’s annual gross domestic product. A fascinat-
ing question relates to whether M-Pesa is a mobile wallet or a mobile 
bank: It began as a transfer mechanism but now offers seamless links to 
 interest-paying savings accounts. More questions relate to whether groups 
or individuals will change their saving or spending habits and whether 
various forms of fraud might slow the rapid growth of the service. As 
microﬁ nance evolves, entities such as post ofﬁ ces will likely emerge as 
partners with carriers, development agencies, and other trusted entities to 
build capability further.
Side Effects of Mobile Money: Afghanistan
Afghanistan in 2001 had little infrastructure and no banking system; 
all transactions were conducted in cash at the time that American 
troops were deployed to the country. As of 2010, 97% of the country 
remains “unbanked,” but mobile money is proving to reduce corrup-
tion. The country has a teledensity approaching 50: 12 million cell 
phones in country of 28 million.
According to two former U.S. Army ofﬁ cers, one of whom served 
in Afghanistan (the other was in Iraq):
In 2009, the Afghan National Police began a test to pay sala-
ries through mobile telephones rather than in cash. It imme-
diately found that at least 10% of its payments had been 
going to ghost policemen who didn’t exist; middlemen in the 
police hierarchy were pocketing the difference. Salaries for 
Afghan police and soldiers are calculated to be competitive 
with Taliban salaries, but beat cops and deployed soldiers 
had been receiving only a fraction of the amount paid by U.S. 
taxpayers because of corruption in the payment system. Most 
Afghan cops assumed that they had been given a signiﬁ cant 
raise when, in fact, they simply received their full pay for the 
ﬁ rst time—over the phone.21

Mobile Health
Given the state of healthcare in much of the developing world, repli-
cating western methods will have only limited success. Decentralized 
approaches, peer-to-peer practices, and remote diagnostics and treatment 
all show great promise. Thus far, many health initiatives are philanthropi-
cally funded, but a new generation of indigenous entrepreneurs is launch-
ing a series of home-grown applications in the ﬁ eld of so-called m-health.
Data collection is one prime opportunity. Given the state of health 
statistics, rapid knowledge of infectious outbreaks, for example, can 
deliver signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts to patients, caregivers, and aid organizations. 
Basic information provision is another opportunity. HIV-positive patients 
in several African countries receive text messages reminding them about 
their medication schedule. University student Josh Nesbit built a simple 
SMS application for health-delivery workers in Malawi in 2007 that merged 
with other efforts to become Medic Mobile, an open-source platform help-
ing to provide a management layer for information gathering, patient 
follow-up, and other nontherapeutic aspects of healthcare: Time savings 
from not having to walk miles to report symptoms or coordinate treatment 
amounted to thousands of hours in the pilot tests.22
Bright Simons is a Ghanaian entrepreneur who developed mPedigree, 
a simple text-based system for identifying counterfeit pharmaceuticals. 
Globally, an estimated 10% to 25% of all drugs sold are fake, but in some 
developing countries, the number can reach 80%, according to the World 
Health Organization. With mPedigree, a scratch-off panel on the packag-
ing reveals a number code. The patient texts the number to a validation 
site, which signals whether the number is legitimate. As of mid-2011, the 
program was running in Ghana, India, Rwanda, and the Philippines.23
Sensors of many shapes and sizes are being coupled to mobile 
phones for remote diagnosis and monitoring. Mobile instruments able to 
measure everything from electrocardiograms, to blood slides, to blood 
pressure are being tested; remote access to even basics such as body 
weight and temperature has value and represents an improvement over 
the current situation in which a caregiver can be hundreds of miles away. 
Just for comparison, Germany has 3.4 doctors for 1,000 citizens; Kenya 
has 1.4 for every 10,000 people.
Looking Ahead
Mobility in the developing world represents several things. First, it is both 
an instance of and a platform for frugal innovation. Second, it is emerg-
ing in cultural ways that differ from the path to mobility in the OECD

countries, given that landlines in many countries were nearly nonexis-
tent. The overlay of cellular networks on top of tribal, kin, and other net-
works will be fascinating to watch and to learn from. Third, the difference 
between applications that range from the trivial to the helpful in the West 
and the truly life-altering possibilities presented by job hunting, agricultural 
price discovery, and healthcare provision on the mobile net is substantial: 
Rarely can anyone on a smartphone claim that the device is a matter of 
life-changing importance, whereas the millions of people connecting for 
the ﬁ rst time are voting with their precious income on exactly that fact.

CHAPTER 13
Work
What constitutes work, where it happens, who does it, and how it is rewarded are all 
in ﬂ ux. Multiple macro-level forces are responsible, and a full treatment of the ques-
tion is out of our current scope. The interaction between people’s work and their tech-
nologies has always been important, however, so some attention to the question is in 
line here.
The Big Picture: Macro Trends
Ever since its founding, the United States has steadily produced more 
and more economic value. In 1900, U.S. gross domestic product 
(GDP) per capita, in current dollars, was $268. By 1950, that ﬁ gure 
had multiplied seven times to about $2,000. Between 1950 and 2000, 
the multiple was 18. To put that per capita ﬁ gure in perspective, real 
GDP rose from $294 billion to $9,817 billion: a 33-fold increase. (The 
ratio of 18 to 33 suggests that total population nearly doubled, which 
it did, from 151 million to 281 million.)
The role of agriculture has changed in surprising ways. The number 
of farms in the United States in 1950 was almost the same as in 1900, a 
little over ﬁ ve and a half million after having peaked in the mid-1930s. By 
2000, the number of farms had dropped to 2.2 million, but the average 
size, possibly reﬂ ecting the rise of organic farms, was actually dropping 
from its high in 1994. The amount of total acreage in farms reached its 
peak in 1953: For all the talk of urbanization in the late nineteenth cen-
tury, it turns out that in 1950, the United States was still robustly rural, in 
land use terms anyway.
The surprising amount of farm acreage belied a strong population 
shift, however. In 1900, 41 percent of the U.S. workforce was employed

in  agriculture. The number fell to 16% in 1945 and to less than 2% in 2000, 
with most workers part time. Agriculture was less than 1% of GDP 
by that time, a ninth of what it had been in 1945.1
Where did people go when they left the farms, which were mostly 
located in the Midwest? South and west, of course: The 13 states that 
constitute the Census Bureau’s West region (every state west of Texas) 
combined to grow from 13% of U.S. population in 1950 to 22.5% 50 years 
later. Surprisingly, the South increased only from 31% to 36%. Before talk-
ing about macroeconomic effects of computing, one has to appreciate 
the impact of other technologies, such as air conditioning, on where peo-
ple live: Such fast-growing states as Virginia, Georgia, Texas, and Arizona 
can be uncomfortable and unhealthy without climate control. Air condi-
tioning in turn raises the importance of electric power, which was still a 
 novelty in the rural South in 1950.
Along with internal migration, the second half of the twentieth century 
was marked by broad social change: Political and economic involvement 
by women became broader, in terms of numbers, and deeper, in terms of 
impact. Women doubled their participation in the workforce, from 30% to 
60% (see Figure 13.1, which begins at 1960), and now women often, but 
not routinely, hold seats as chief executives, senators, Supreme Court jus-
tices, and astronauts. Women also constitute well over half of the college 
population only a generation after having gained admittance to the lead-
ing private universities. The United States is also a much older nation than 
in 1950. Life expectancy at birth has risen from 68 to 77. Both of these 
trends relate closely to changes in medical technology and, for women, 
birth control. It will require further study to determine how much the 
increase in life expectancy relates to computing: Trends in immunization,

smoking, nutrition, and cardiac interventions are, I suspect, far more 
important.
In demographic terms, the automobile stands out among technolo-
gies with major impact. The pervasiveness of its inﬂ uence tracks closely 
with the invention and habitation of the suburb—a term that did not 
exist at the time of the 1900 census. But from 1910 until 1950, when 
the percentage of population in suburbs more than tripled, to 23% 
of the population, the rise of the automobile literally reshaped the land-
scape. In the 50 years of the information age that constitutes our focus 
here, the percentage of population in suburbs more than doubled: Fully 
half the U.S. population now lives in suburbs, a striking testimony to 
the geographic transition caused by the automobile.
Shifting from residence to occupation, manufacturing grew at agricul-
ture’s expense, as the air conditioning—and automobile-related ﬁ gures 
would suggest. But while manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at 
over 19 million jobs, it had been declining since 1953 as a percentage of 
total employment: The drop, from 1 job in 3 to 1 in 12, constitutes another 
deﬁ ning characteristic of the past half century.
Where
As the world and the North American economy become more virtual, 
businesses are encountering new layers of the paradox of place. An 
Internet connection can link two people by voice, text chat, or video 
almost anywhere in the developed world, with many developing nations 
catching up fast. As coordination costs drop, work can more easily 
migrate to low-wage locales. For product work, that migration implies 
moving factories. More recently, services from radiology, to call centers, 
to coding have begun to be outsourced and/or offshored. One shorthand 
prediction calls China the emerging factory to the world, with India its 
back ofﬁ ce. But costs are only one aspect of the tension between place 
and space.
The dynamics of place affect many business choices. Locating a fac-
tory or distribution center near a prime customer, as Dell’s suppliers have 
near Austin, tightens tolerances on deliveries and can support higher lev-
els of customer service. Moving research and development operations 
near major university centers, as Novartis and other companies have 
around MIT and Harvard, can impose high wage scales onto employers. 
For employers outside those sectors that do not require such specialized

destination, and high housing prices are noted as a major deterrent to job 
growth there.

Work
Richard Florida’s inﬂ uential book, The Rise of the Creative Class,2 
argued that rather than lobbying with tax breaks and other inducements 
for large Toyota or Mercedes factories, states and localities in search of jobs 
should instead seek to attract creative individuals. Because these people 
can do such tasks as stock picking, screenwriting, or software architec-
ture essentially anywhere, they tend to migrate to places with good music 
and culture, interesting restaurants and diverse populations, and strong 
educational institutions. After arriving, they put their skills and networks 
together and make jobs for themselves and others. Florida’s examples—
San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh, among many others—appear 
to support his thesis. But another characteristic joins these places: Essential 
but noncreative people such as plumbers, police ofﬁ cers, teachers, and 
support personnel can get priced out of cities that he lists as exemplars.
The commuting distance for the working people who make creative 
centers work is increasing. These jobs matter for quality of life. Places like 
Marin County, California, and Greenwich, Connecticut, are undeniably 
appealing in many ways. But what happens when auto repair shops and 
dry cleaners can’t survive? Many skilled jobs can be performed remotely, 
to be sure, but how can afﬂ uent, attractive locales keep nurses, deliv-
ery truck drivers, and other people whose skills are in short supply right 
now? Societies at all stages of economic development are experiencing the 
effects of selective job mobility in the aftermath of the Internet and cellular 
telephony revolutions.
There’s another recent phenomenon of skills and place: Workers in 
skilled jobs (such as information technology) often are trained at academic 
centers far from an employer base. Kathy Brittain White served as chief 
information ofﬁ cer at Cardinal Health before founding Rural Sourcing, an 
American company that seeks to provide the cost savings of displacing 
work to a lower-cost, lower-wage environment. Her twist to the offshore 
model is locating programming and support centers in such places as 
Greenville, North Carolina—home to East Carolina University, which now 
enrolls more than 20,000 students.
Rural Sourcing uses networks to take relative isolation and turn it into 
comparative advantage. In a parallel move, Google opened major facili-
ties in New York, Ann Arbor, and Pittsburgh, the latter because of Carnegie 
Mellon’s powerful computer science presence. In the nineteenth century, 
proximity to water power made New England mill towns economic engines 
for the shoe and textile industries that were centered there. Detroit built on 
access to freighter ports that delivered the bulk materials for the auto indus-
try (and on the venture capital provided by timber barons enriched by the 
need for mass-produced wooden furniture and building supplies).
Today, university towns are vying to attract knowledge-intensive 
industries, but what are the other sources of advantage for the next

25 years? If home-schooling continues its strong rise in popularity, more 
people might move to places without demonstrably good school sys-
tems. Telemedicine could reduce the urge to live near major medical cen-
ters. Long commutes have multiple negative side effects,3 so towns with 
light trafﬁ c will likely increase in appeal. Online shopping addresses the 
 concern about the lack of quality retailers in a given place. Many such 
wildcards remain to be played.
Far from the ﬁ elds that White is cultivating, the place of cities remains 
contested and important. The public intellectual Jane Jacobs, a powerful 
voice in twentieth-century American urbanism, lacked academic creden-
tials but argued for the organic aspects of cities. She opposed zoning, for 
example, reasoning that people should be able to live near their work. 
Her energy and ideas helped defeat some of the more sweeping “urban 
renewal” efforts of the 1950s and 1960s as citizen movements began to 
oppose the bulldozing of neighborhoods that happened to lie in the path 
of expressways. Criticized for advocating gentriﬁ cation, she herself was 
priced out of Greenwich Village in the 1990s and found Toronto more 
hospitable to her thinking (and ﬁ nancial means) than her adopted New 
York, which she tended to idealize. Jacobs’s crusade served as a reminder 
that the cost of the suburban model can be measured only partially in fuel 
consumption or rising commute times.4
The best-selling author Thomas Friedman famously asserted that “the 
world is ﬂ at” in his book of that name: Anyone anywhere can participate 
in the global economy via various connections.5 Florida replied that, rather 
than being ﬂ at, “the world is spiky” in that concentrations of talent and 
resources matter more than the ubiquitous access Friedman chronicles. 
Instead of forcing these two arguments into false opposition, it is useful 
to use the insights of both to examine how connection is changing work, 
culture, and economics.
The uncomfortable juxtaposition of globalization and locality is not 
a new phenomenon—just look at England in the twilight of empire. If 
people earn money only from local sources but spend it on goods and, 
increasingly, services from “away,” eventually money needs to come 
back into the locality: Just as a multicrop family farm is no longer a via-
ble option for many, neither is a self-sustaining local economy. Somehow, 
money needs to come in as well as leave, and the current trade imbalance 
and federal debt levels both ratchet up that imperative.

One of the great but difﬁ cult thinkers of the twentieth century, the econ-
omist and satirist Thorstein Veblen, wrestled with people’s interconnected

relationships both to what Karl Marx* named the means of production 
and to the consumption of mass-produced goods. Veblen attributed a 
nobility to work that he called the “instinct of workmanship”: Man the 
maker “has a sense of the merit of serviceability or efﬁ ciency and of 
the demerit of futility, waste, or incapacity.” By contrast, what Veblen 
memorably named “conspicuous consumption” was “ceremonial” in that 
it sorted people by reputation, the basis of an ultimately unwinnable 
competition.6
By mentioning Veblen I raise an unanswerable question. The people 
who buy mass-produced stuff, often called “consumers,” want in some 
deep-rooted way to shape their environment beyond just piling up pur-
chased goods. How much people want to stand out as unique, and how 
much they want to create something tangible, is of course impossible to 
differentiate or quantify, and sometimes an artifact embodies both con-
sumption (or conspicuousness) and workmanship. But the current busi-
ness landscape provides too many examples for this to be a fad: There’s 
something very potent afoot in the rise of cooking shows, in “maker” cul-
ture, and in such phenomena as Habitat for Humanity.
Harvard professor Daniel Bell identiﬁ ed what he called the coming of 
postindustrial society more than 30 years ago, but it took the Internet for us 
to feel what it’s like to transcend factories the way factories had trumped 
farming roughly a half-century before he wrote. As information about stuff 
becomes more valuable than stuff itself, the activities of creation and indi-
vidualization take on a new shape in both tangible and intangible realms. 
First, in an economy largely devoted to nonessentials, there exists some 
(essential?) desire to make meaningful stuff, not just ideas and decisions. 
Second, we can see a broad-based quest to differentiate oneself by dif-
ferentiating one’s stuff. Finally, there’s a sense of entitlement, related to the 
“affordable luxury” trend embodied by Starbucks, itself a primo customizer: 
I want the best (of something) made for me because I’m worth it.
Skills
Like many others, I persist in believing that the transformative power of 
computing lies ahead of us. Whether it’s in genome-aware therapeutics, 
or rich-media self-publishing, or low-cost avionics that make small jets fea-
sible as air taxis, the majority of digital innovations that will remake the 
* German political philosopher and progenitor of social science, whose ideas 
underlie modern communism (1818–1883).

economy are as yet uncommercialized. And compared to such landmarks 
as the invention of the steam engine or the factory system, our 50 years of 
computing represents enormous change in short time. The daunting fact is 
that the change to come looms even bigger.
In the interim, the demands of a digital economy contribute to 
complex and difﬁ cult demographic issues: skill- and education-based 
bifurcation, along with a changing racial composition. In the middle 
of the twentieth century, factory work paid better than farm work 
and was widely accessible at the low end. People could leave farms, 
enter manufacturing with no or few skills and little education, and stay 
aﬂ oat. A further correlate here is decentralization: Factory work collects 
resources in one place while services industries (and powerful commu-
nications networks) disperse them. What are the consequences of the 
growth of the South and West without a heavy reliance on industrial 
centers such as Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, or Detroit?
Prior to and during World War II, the internal migration of black 
Americans from the rural South to the industrial Midwest led to such 
varied changes as a rebirth of popular music, a power base for the 
Democratic party, and the rise of a black middle class. Only one or two 
cultural hops separate Henry Ford from Diana Ross, Lyndon Johnson, and 
the Cosby Show. Look a little closer and you see the Rolling Stones, Magic 
Johnson’s National Basketball Association, and Oprah Winfrey, who was 
born in Mississippi but made her name in Chicago.
Now the opposite dynamic is at work as manufacturing automation 
and globalization release workers to take jobs in lower-paying catego-
ries, such as hospital food service or big-box retail; in raw numbers, the 
biggest job creators for several years after 2001 were Home Depot and 
Lowe’s, and of course Wal-Mart’s net role in employment remains hotly 
disputed. Retail and other services often teach their workers how to use 
automated systems but rarely prepare them to enter a better-paying sector. 
How the shift to services interrelates with America’s racial picture, includ-
ing of course the emerging Hispanic majority, will be critically important 
to track.
As the CIA’s World Factbook puts the issue:
The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual develop-
ment of a “two-tier labor market” in which those at the bottom 
lack the education and the professional/technical skills of those 
at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay raises, 
health insurance coverage, and other beneﬁ ts. Since 1975, practi-
cally all the gains in household income have gone to the top 20% 
of households.7

Work
The consequences of such a bifurcated populace touch sociology, 
politics, economics, and even ethics, so I won’t even attempt a summary 
comment. Perhaps this trend is the result of moving farther and farther 
from a subsistence economy. One of the things we’ll be tracking as this 
research progresses is the changing composition of the economy away 
from food, clothing, and shelter to transportation, entertainment, and other 
luxuries. The interplay of rapid population growth, rapid increase in the 
amount of livable and available real estate, wider education, suburbaniza-
tion, and the shift to a services economy all contribute to making the task 
of assessing information’s role highly problematic.
Work
What have computers and the digital revolution done to work? Answers 
vary considerably. In 1992, Robert Reich (later Bill Clinton’s secretary of 
labor) devised a tripartite schema to classify the workers of the world, see-
ing global workforces as already having been divided into three groups: 
routine producers (e.g., call center reps or assembly-line workers), in-
person servers (waiters or nurses), and symbolic analysts who manipulate 
pure information for large proﬁ ts (Wall Street quants). Digitization in the 
service of high leverage made the “symbolic analysts” rich and skewed 
income distribution. Seeing the relation of rich to poor less than 20 years 
later, Reich may have been onto something crucial, but his tepid  solution—
training and education—has failed to shift the terms of the debate, partly 
because school systems change incredibly slowly and require levels (and 
types) of investment that are for a number of reasons politically impossible 
in the United States.
A decade later, Richard Florida deﬁ ned the engine of the new econ-
omy as the “creative class,” 38 million of whom comprised 30% of the 
workforce. For the winners, digitization empowers ﬂ exible work that gives 
great meaning:
In this new world, it is no longer the organizations we work for, 
churches, neighborhoods, or even family ties that deﬁ ne us. 
Instead, we do this ourselves, deﬁ ning our identities along the 
varied dimensions of our creativity. Other aspects of our lives—
what we consume, new forms of leisure and recreation, efforts at 
community- building—then organize themselves around this pro-
cess of identity creation.8
Surely 30% of the workforce can’t work at ad agencies or Disney. No, 
says Florida:

I deﬁ ne the core of the Creative Class to include people in sci-
ence and engineering, architecture and design, education, arts, 
music and entertainment, whose economic function is to create 
new ideas, new technology and/or new creative content. Around 
the core, the Creative Class also includes a broader group of cre-
ative professionals in business and ﬁ nance, law, health care and 
related ﬁ elds.
The core and the doughnut are linked not by geography or income or 
skills but by a value set:
[A]ll members of the Creative Class—whether they are artists or engi-
neers, musicians or computer scientists, writers or  entrepreneurs—
share a common creative ethos that values creativity, individuality, 
difference and merit. For the members of the Creative Class, every 
aspect and every manifestation of creativity—technological, cultural 
and economic—is interlinked and inseparable.9
Whatever its relation to life as most people know it, Florida’s book 
resonated. It led to a thriving consulting business helping cities attempt 
to become more economically competitive. How? Not with tax incentives 
for auto plants but by luring more of those 38 million people with more 
tolerant attitudes, better mass transit, more authentic espresso bars, and 
the other factors that separate Toronto from Topeka or Minneapolis from 
Modesto.
In the intervening years, however, much has happened to cast doubt 
on Florida’s vision of the future. What exactly do those creative people 
do to help the U.S. balance of trade deﬁ cit? Movies, mergers and acquisi-
tion deals, and Microsoft all contribute to exports, but not to the degree 
that farm goods do, and none approaches the aerospace sector’s interna-
tional impact. What happens when offshore competition threatens large 
numbers of those 38 million jobs? Legal research, programming, equity 
analysis, and even moviemaking and distance learning are already being 
produced and delivered from afar in lower-wage settings—what will be 
next?
More fundamentally, just how creative are those 38 million people? 
Job titles can be deceiving: A good friend of mine was for a time an archi-
tect at HOK, the sports division of which has given us such modern mon-
uments as Camden Yards in Baltimore or AT&T Park in San Francisco. 
What was our young Howard Roark’s creative contribution? Bathrooms for 
the Hong Kong airport.
Matthew Crawford, in a recent book called Shop Class as Soulcraft, 
raises similar doubts.10 Beginning with the observation that many high

Work
schools are dropping shop class because it fails to train people to be sym-
bolic analysts, Crawford challenges the reader to think deeply about the 
value of work. Because it often lacks real output, modern bureaucratic 
life, deﬁ ned largely by ofﬁ ce automation, can be unfulﬁ lling. In contrast to 
the carpenter whose windows can’t leak, or the farmer who feeds people 
with tangible crops or livestock, the ofﬁ ce worker (creative or not) lacks 
physical boundaries to deﬁ ne the real from the artiﬁ cial or the possible 
from the impossible.
As Crawford notes, quoting Robert Jackall’s Moral Mazes (now 
20 years old), ofﬁ ce memos are crafted to be unincriminating no mat-
ter how subsequent events play out. Taking a ﬁ rm stand is often seen as 
career limiting, so most eventualities remain unforeclosed; every statement 
is hedged. Along similar lines, after receiving a PhD from the University 
of Chicago, Crawford works for a think tank generating position papers 
that begin not with the facts but with a position, reasoning backward to 
convenient truths. It is intellectual bad faith of the ﬁ rst order, and he quits. 
Worse yet, in his circles of occupational hell, are jobs built on teams with 
their indeterminate appropriation of credit and blame, along with the 
human resource-driven trust-building games that frequently pass the point 
of self-parody.
In contrast, the author points to his work as a motorcycle mechanic. 
No symbolic analyst he, Crawford confronts physical limits every day and 
pays a steep price for failure. If he drops a washer into a crankcase, at 
times he must tear down the engine block to retrieve it and cannot in 
good conscience bill the customer for all of the hours involved. Mistakes, 
stupid or otherwise, have concrete consequences. On the positive side of 
the ledger, when he ﬁ xes a broken fork, returns a dead bike to life after 
10 years off the road, or hears the particular sound of a well-tuned engine, 
he derives great satisfaction. He also contends that mechanical work can 
be more intellectually engaging than knowledge work, implicitly challeng-
ing Florida’s new world order.
In some measure, we are ﬁ ghting a new stage of the philosophical 
battle joined by Rene Descartes (1596–1650), who separated thought from 
emotion and thereby physicality. Craft work (ﬁ xing or building things) 
joins the practice of medicine, certainly, but also full-throated singing as 
moments where mind and body unite. Sport constitutes another similar 
realm, as does cooking, the recent enthusiasm for which might be seen 
as a reassertion of the satisfaction that can come only when head, hands, 
and palate unite in a primal act—that of feeding another person. Compare 
the gestalt of today’s many cooking shows to the treatment of the modern 
workplace in current television programming and the contrast is obvious: 
Julia Child, enshrined at the Smithsonian, is a hero while cubicle America’s 
cultural icon has yet to transcend the comic strip Dilbert.

Looking Ahead 
149
Shop Class as Soulcraft also makes the pragmatic point that ﬁ xing 
things cannot be offshored; one can make a healthy living as an elec-
trician, for example, or an auto repairman. Last time I was in for an oil 
change, my mechanic was telling me about one manufacturer’s switch to a 
ﬁ ber-optic system bus—he knows more computer networking than I ever 
will. To service appliances or furnaces today is to have studied hundreds 
of hours of digital control and monitoring technology. High schools, how-
ever, generally operate under the principle that college-bound students 
will have better careers than those who work in jobs that require mere 
training. But what economists call the education premium can no longer 
be assured today, much less in 50 years when today’s high school gradu-
ates will almost certainly still be working.
There’s also the matter of permanence. As Crawford notes, many 
of today’s appliances are built to break and not be repaired. How does 
today’s work give people the opportunity to build something that will last 
beyond their life span? For teachers, this is one of the true joys of the pro-
fession. For most knowledge workers, the answer is less clear. True crafts-
men raise a red ﬂ ag about throw-away work. As Michael Ruhlman, known 
more for his books on chefs and cooking, reported in a book on wooden 
boats:
I asked Gannon why wooden boats were important to him—why 
had he devoted his life to them? Ross seemed surprised by my 
apparent ignorance regarding what to him was plain, and his 
blazing eyes burned right through me.
“Do you want to teach your daughter [then three years old] 
that what you do, what you care about, is disposable?” he asked. 
“That you can throw your work away? It doesn’t matter?”11
Whether in passing down the family farm or painting “& Sons” on 
the service van, craft work is often connected to future generations that 
bureaucracy cannot sustain. This lack of long-term continuity may be 
another reason why the modern ofﬁ ce lacks heroic images in popular 
culture.
Looking Ahead
Tom Malone of MIT explores the future landscape of work through the 
lens of its institutions. In his 2004 book, The Future of Work, he lays out 
various scenarios primarily concerned with the coordination and collab-
orative facets of organizations.12 He sees the future as more decentralized, 
less hierarchical, and more democratic. If it comes to pass, Malone’s vision

Work
foreshadows the demise of The Ofﬁ ce’s Michael Scott and his kin. Pettiness 
and incompetence are eternal, however, so it is worth pondering both 
what will happen to a Michael in a Maloneite world and what manner of 
successor will emerge instead.
In the end of any analysis, work cannot be categorized with any pre-
cision. It is both universal and speciﬁ cally grounded in time, place, and 
individual. It offers both rewards and challenges (some of which may 
overlap), utilizes groups and solo contributors, and deﬁ nes us in multiple 
ways. The diversity of the perspectives mentioned here is itself incom-
plete, missing, for example, the perspective of the Japanese salaryman, the 
unionized autoworker, or the classic professions of law or clergy (both of 
which themselves are in the midst of deep change). I have made no men-
tion of wages, which are retreating in many settings. The appeal of Dan 
Pink’s vision of Free Agent Nation (2002), for example, has been replaced 
by the reality of the less glamorous name for continuous partial employ-
ment: “temping.”
As to the question What have computers done to work?, the answer is 
probably less clear than it will be in another 25 years, when the changes 
to economies, workplaces, and individual performance will separate them-
selves from the end of the oil/automotive/steel age that wound down in 
the late twentieth century. The exciting news comes in the realization that the 
future of work is not yet deﬁ ned, making it contingent on the attitudes and 
actions of many people.

CHAPTER 14
Productivity
There are some structural issues with our economy, where a lot of busi-
nesses have learned to become much more efﬁ cient with a lot fewer 
workers. You see it when you go to a bank and you use an ATM; you 
don’t go to a bank teller.
—President Barack Obama, June 14, 2011
Do computers and similar technologies make economies grow? Do these technologies 
displace workers? How might information and technology improve economic perfor-
mance, whether at the ﬁ rm, sector, or national level? Because previous technologies 
augmented physical power and mastery, they offer only limited insight into the impact 
of technologies that expand people’s abilities to remember, to know, and to connect.
The debate over the relationship between automating technologies and 
unemployment is not new, as Adam Smith’s famous example of pin mak-
ing goes back to 1776 (see Chapter 8). Trying to understand services pro-
ductivity is particularly messy: That automated teller machine does not 
merely replicate the pin factory or behave like industrial scenarios. Finally, 
trying to quantify the particular contribution of information technol-
ogy (IT) to productivity, and thus to the current unemployment scenario, 
proves particularly difﬁ cult. Nevertheless, the question is worth consider-
ing closely insofar as multiple shifts are coinciding, making job seeking, 
managing, investing, and policy formulation difﬁ cult, at best, in these chal-
lenging times.

Productivity
Classic Productivity Deﬁ nitions
At the most basic level, a nation’s economic output is divided by the 
number of workers or the number of hours worked. This model is obvi-
ously rough and has two major implications. First, investment (whether 
in better machinery or elsewhere) does not necessarily map to hours 
worked. Second, unemployment should drive this measure of productiv-
ity up, all other things being equal, merely as a matter of shrinking the 
denominator in the fraction: Fewer workers producing the same level 
of output are intuitively more productive. Unemployment, however, is 
not free.
A more sophisticated metric is called multifactor productivity, or MFP. 
This indicator attempts to track how efﬁ ciently both labor and capital are 
being utilized. It is calculated as a residual, by looking at hours worked 
(or some variant thereof) and capital stock (summarizing a nation’s bal-
ance sheet, as it were, to tally up the things that can produce other 
things of value for sale). Any rise in economic output not captured in 
labor or capital will be counted as improved productivity. The problem 
here is that measuring productive capital at any level of scale is extremely 
difﬁ cult.1
MFP, while hard to pin down, does have advantages. One strength 
is in its emphasis on innovation. In theory, if inventors and innovators 
are granted monopolies (through patents), their investment in new tech-
nologies can be recouped as competitors are prevented from copying 
the innovation.2 Skilled labor is an important ingredient in this process: 
Commercialization is much more difﬁ cult if the workforce cannot perform 
the necessary functions to bring new ideas and products to market. For 
one estimate of MFP for the United States, see Figure 14.1.
One relevant study took a deep dive into one manufacturing niche: 
valve assembly. The researchers found three mechanisms by which IT 
could inﬂ uence productivity by changing business practices, not merely 
accelerating current-state activities:
We ﬁ nd that adoption of new IT-enhanced equipment (1) alters 
business strategies, moving valve manufacturers away from com-
modity production based on long production runs to custom-
ized production in smaller batches; (2) improves the efﬁ ciency of 
all stages of the production process with reductions in setup times 
supporting the change in business strategy; and (3) increases the 
skill requirements of workers while promoting the adoption of new 
human resource practices.3

Services Productivity
As The Economist points out, quoting Fast Company from 2004, ATMs 
did not displace bank tellers. Instead, the rise of self-service coincided 
with a broad expansion of bank functions and an aging (and growing) 
American population: Baby boomers started needing lots of car loans, 
and home mortgages, and tuition loans starting in about 1970, when the 
ﬁ rst boomers turned 25. People were required to deliver all those ﬁ nan-
cial services:
1985: 60,000 ATMs; 485,000 bank tellers
2002: 352,000 ATMs; 527,000 bank tellers4
That a technology advance coincided with a shift in the banking mar-
ket tells us little about productivity. Did ATMs, or word processors, or 
BlackBerries increase output per unit of input? Nobody knows: The output 
of a bank teller, or nurse, or college professor, is notoriously hard to mea-
sure. Even at the aggregate level, the measurement problem is signiﬁ cant.

Productivity
Is a bank’s output merely the sum of its teller transactions? Maybe. Other 
economists argue that a bank should be measured by its balances of loans 
and deposits.5
A key concept in macroeconomics concerns intermediate goods: 
raw material purchases, work-in-process inventory, and the like. Very 
few services were included in these calculations, airplane tickets and 
telephone bills being exceptions. As of the early 1990s, for example, 
ad agencies and computer programming were not included.6 Thus, 
the problem is twofold: Services inputs to certain facets of the econ-
omy were not counted, and the output of systems integrators, such 
as Accenture or Tata Consulting Services, or advertising ﬁ rms, such as 
Publicis or WPP, is intuitively very difﬁ cult to count in any consistent or 
meaningful manner.
Services Productivity and Information Technology
In the mid-1990s, a number of prominent economists pointed to roughly 
three decades of investment in computers along with the related software 
and services and asked for statistical evidence of IT’s improvement of pro-
ductivity, particularly in the period between 1974 and 1994, when overall 
productivity stagnated.
Those years coincided with the steep decline in manufacturing’s con-
tribution to the U.S. economy. Measuring the productivity of an individ-
ual ofﬁ ce worker is difﬁ cult (as in a performance review), not to mention 
measuring the productivity of millions of such workers in the aggregate. 
Services are especially sensitive to labor inputs: Low student–faculty ratios 
are usually thought to represent quality teaching, not inefﬁ ciency. As the 
economist William Baumol noted, a string quintet still must be played by 
ﬁ ve musicians; there has been zero increase in productivity over the 300 
years since the art form originated.7
The late 1990s were marked by the Internet stock market bubble, 
heavy investment by large ﬁ rms in enterprise software packages, and busi-
ness process “reengineering.” Alongside these developments, productivity 
spiked: Manufacturing sectors improved an average of 2.3% annually, but 
services did even better, at 2.6%. In hotels, however, the effect was less 
pronounced, possibly reﬂ ecting Baumol’s “disease” in which high-quality 
service is associated with high labor content.8
Unfortunately, healthcare is another component in the services sector 
marked by low productivity growth and, until recently, relatively low inno-
vation in the use of it. Measuring the productivity of such a vast, inefﬁ -
ciently organized, and intangibly measured sector is inherently difﬁ cult, so

it will be hard to assess the impact of self-care, for example: People who 
research their back spasms on the Internet, try some exercises or heating 
pads, and avoid a trip to a physician. Such behavior should improve the 
productivity of the doctor’s ofﬁ ce, but only in theory can it be counted.
In a systematic review of the IT productivity paradox in the mid-
1990s, economist Eric Brynjolfsson and his colleagues at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology investigated what they saw as four explanations 
for the apparent contradiction.9 Subsequent history suggests they are 
correct.
 1. Mismeasurement of outputs and inputs. Services industries (led by the 
ﬁ nancial sector) are among the heaviest users of IT, and services out-
puts are hard to measure. As we saw, productivity statistics in general 
are complex and not terribly robust.
 2. Lags due to learning and adjustment. This explanation has grown 
in inﬂ uence in the past 15 years. To take one common example, the 
organizational adjustment to a $50 million to $100 million enterprise 
software deployment takes years, by which time many other factors 
will inﬂ uence productivity: currency ﬂ uctuations, mergers or acquisi-
tions, broad economic recessions, and so on.
 3. Redistribution and dissipation of proﬁ ts. If a leading ﬁ rm in a sector 
uses information effectively, it may steal market share from less effec-
tive competitors. The sector at large thus may not appear to gain in 
productivity. In addition, IT-maximizing ﬁ rms might be using the tech-
nology investment for more effective forecasting, let’s say, as opposed 
to using less labor in order fulﬁ llment. The latter action would the-
oretically improve productivity. But if the wrong items were being 
produced relative to the market leader that more accurately sensed 
demand, proﬁ tability would improve at the leading ﬁ rm even though 
productivity could go up at the laggard.
 4. Mismanagement of information and technology. In the early years of 
computing, paper processes were automated but the basic  business 
design was left unchanged. In the 1990s, however, such compa-
nies as Wal-Mart, Dell, Amazon, and Google invented entirely new 
business processes and in some cases business models building 
on IT. The revenue per employee at Amazon ($960,000) or Google 
($1.2 million) is far higher than at Harley-Davidson or Clorox (both 
are leanness leaders in their respective categories at about $650,000). 
“Mismanagement” sounds negative, but it is easy to see, as with every 
past technology shift, that managers take decades to internalize the 
capability of a new way of doing work before they can reinvent com-
merce to exploit the new tools.

Productivity
Information Technology and Unemployment
Are we in a situation that parallels farming, when tractors reduced the 
number of men and horses needed to work a given acreage? One way 
to look at the question involves job losses by industry. Using Bureau of 
Labor Statistics (BLS) numbers from 2009 (see Table 14.1), I compared 
the number of layoffs and business closings to the total employment 
in the sector.10 Not surprisingly, construction and manufacturing both 
lost in excess of 10% of total jobs. It’s hard to point to IT as a prime fac-
tor in either case: The credit crisis and China, respectively, are much more 
likely explanations. Professional and business services, an extremely broad 
 category, shrank by 8% in one year, which includes consultants among 
many other titles.
Another analysis can come from looking at jobs that never material-
ized. Using the BLS 10-year projections of job growth from 2000,11 the 
computer and information industry moved in a very different direction 
from what economists predicted. Applications programmers, for exam-
ple, rather than being a growth category, actually grew only modestly. 
Desktop publishers shrank in numbers, possibly because of the rise of 
blogs and other Web- rather than paper-based formats. The population 
of customer service reps was projected to grow 32% in 10 years; the actual 
growth was about 10%, possibly reﬂ ecting a combination of offshoring 
and self-service, both phone and Web based. The need for retail sales-
people was projected to grow by 12%, but the number stayed ﬂ at. Here is 
another example where IT, in the form of the Web and self-service, might 
play a role.

Looking Ahead 
159
Neither sales clerks nor customer service reps would constitute any-
thing like a backbone of a vibrant middle class: Average annual wages 
for retail are about $25,000 while customer service reps do somewhat 
better, at nearly $33,000. The decline of middle-class jobs is a complex 
phenomenon: IT deﬁ nitely automated away the payroll clerk, formerly a 
reliably middle-class position in many ﬁ rms, to take one example. Auto 
industry union employment is shrinking, however, in large part because 
of foreign competition, not robotic armies displacing humans. That same 
competitive pressure has taken a toll on the thick management layer in 
Detroit as well, as the real estate market in the suburbs there can testify. 
Those brand managers were not made obsolete by computers.
Looking Ahead
President Obama gets the (almost) last word. In a town hall meeting in 
Illinois in mid-August 2011, he returned to the ATM theme:
One of the challenges in terms of rebuilding our economy is busi-
nesses have gotten so efﬁ cient that—when was the last time some-
body went to a bank teller instead of using the ATM, or used a travel 
agent instead of just going online? A lot of jobs that used to be out 
there requiring people now have become automated.12
Have they really? The impact of IT and its concomitant automation 
on the unemployment rate is not at all clear. The effect is highly variable 
across different countries, for example. Looking domestically, travel agent 
was never a major job category: Even if such jobs were automated away 
as the number of agencies dropped by about two-thirds in the decade-
plus after 1998,13 such numbers pale alongside construction, manufactur-
ing, and, I would wager, computer programmers whose positions were 
offshored.
The unfortunate thing in the entire discussion, apart from people 
without jobs obviously, is the lack of political and popular understand-
ing of both the sources of the unemployment and the necessary solutions. 
Merely saying “education” or “job retraining” defers rather than settles the 
debate about what is to be done in the face of the structural transforma-
tion we are living through. On that aspect, the president is assuredly cor-
rect: He has the terminology correct, but structural changes need to be 
addressed with fundamental rethinking of rules and behaviors rather than 
with sound bites and Band-Aids.

CHAPTER 15
Business Model Overview
Technology changes of the sort we have examined at length represent one strand of 
innovation—a better mousetrap, as it were. But for technological innovation to make 
its way to people in the marketplace, a second factor is required: a business model. 
That is, there must be an organization of resources that facilitates an exchange of 
value, often monetary, in order that technology artifacts can ﬁ nd users.
For most of the mass production era, business models have involved 
capital-intensive factories or collections of infrastructure that generated 
products or services consumed by paying customers. With information 
goods in a digital era not necessarily requiring the same capital intensive-
ness, business models have proliferated: One professor who has studied 
Internet commerce has organized dozens of examples into nine families.*1 
Thus, (1) packaging the right technology into the right market offering 
(product, service, or hybrid), (2) creating a compelling exchange propo-
sition, and (3) organizing resources to make the trades happen requires 
additional types and layers of innovation, capital, and management. The 
better mousetrap, in short, requires a mousetrap store, collective, founda-
tion, or other arrangement to connect the product with people’s needs.
* The nine families are advertising, afﬁ liate, brokerage, community, infomediary, 
manufacturer (direct), merchant, subscription, and utility.

Growth in a Connected World

Business Model Overview
Deﬁ nition
While the term “business model” is widely used,* I follow the deﬁ nition 
of my previous coauthor, Henning Kagermann, the former chief execu-
tive of the German software company SAP. A business model, he and his 
coauthors state, consists of four interlocking elements that, taken together, 
create and deliver value.
 1. Customer value proposition, including target customer, the customer’s 
job to be done, and the offering that satisﬁ es the problem or fulﬁ lls 
the need.
 2. Proﬁ t formula, including the revenue model, cost structure, margin 
model, and resource velocity (lead times, turns, etc.).
 3. Key resources to deliver the customer value proposition proﬁ tably, 
potentially including people, equipment, technologies, partnerships, 
brand, and so on.
 4. Key processes also include rules, metrics, and norms of behavior that 
make repeated delivery of the customer value proposition repeatable 
and scalable.2
Let us expand on each of these dimensions.
The customer value proposition gets much of management’s atten-
tion insofar as it’s front and center at the nexus of provider and customer. 
Kagermann and his coauthors rightly focus on the customer as a person 
(potentially a person in an organizational role) with a job to do or need to 
be ﬁ lled. This orientation can help prevent against infatuation with a tech-
nology for its own sake, a “push” orientation toward innovation.
Proﬁ t formulas have become problematic in the age of “free” as a viable 
price point for many digital goods. Linux and Wikipedia have business mod-
els even though they lack proﬁ t formulas. Similarly, Microsoft and the New 
York Times Company have been forced to reinvent their business models 
by the presence of free alternatives. Even in traditional for-proﬁ t businesses, 
the scale of digital business can alter the business model landscape. Google 
is estimated to deliver 34,000 search results per second; Facebook reached 
a half billion users in six years. Radio took 38 years to ship 50 million units; 
the iPod took 3 years to hit the same milestone. Each of these four technolo-
gies has a distinctive set of proﬁ t formulas to ﬁ t its context.
In addition, proﬁ t formulas typically include a time scale: are key pro-
cesses enacted in tenths of a second (Google), in days (luxury resorts), 
* A Google search on the phrase “business model” returned 6.8 million hits in late 
2010.

in decades (life insurance)? Charles Fine’s notion of “clockspeed”3 has 
been redeﬁ ned in the past decade by such developments as smartphone 
app marketplaces, Twitter feeds, and real-time status updates for social 
gaming at Sony, Microsoft, and Facebook. The speed of technology-
driven change—which futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil insists is getting 
faster*—stress-tests many organizations: Lucent, Sun Microsystems, and 
Motorola merely begin a list of companies dragged down in the vortex of 
rapid change.
Key resources are changing. Intellectual property, brand, and other 
intangibles matter in new ways (compare Amazon’s patent portfolio 
to Xerox’s), yet physical infrastructure is also scaling to new levels. For 
example, as we discussed, AT&T’s wireless data trafﬁ c increased 5,000% in 
four years; few businesses have ever had to address that kind of growth 
at a national level. Leadership remains a scarce resource, as comparisons 
of Yahoo! and Google, or Microsoft pre- and post-Bill Gates’s retirement 
show.
Key processes encompass a wide range of activities. Formal policies, 
informal cultural practices, operational choices, and measurement and 
incentive systems can each be a critical element in a venture’s success. 
Note that repetition is listed as a goal: One-hit wonders are too often 
the norm in technology-driven businesses. Similarly, in an age of net-
work effects, global reach, and cheap media, scale has become a strate-
gic dimension in ways it might not have been in industries where growth 
occurred at a less frenetic pace.
Changing Minds, Changing Models
Even when the need is clear, however, changing a business model can be 
difﬁ cult. General Motors’ template for labor costs, model changeovers, and 
brand management dates to the 1960s and did not adapt to new dynam-
ics of competition, healthcare cost explosion, and consumer behavior; the 
company had to declare bankruptcy and rethink every aspect of its busi-
ness after 2008. The music industry’s bundling of songs into LP records 
worked for a few decades, but the model failed in the digital era, leaving 
the labels’ economics and practices out of step with the market. Established 
air carriers’ inattention to the low end of the market and to their own cost 
structures left them vulnerable to a new wave of budget airlines, such as 
EasyJet, Ryan Air, and Southwest.4 American Airlines used to be a star in the 
* Kurzweil famously contends that the rate of change is itself accelerating. See

Business Model Overview
industry because of its pioneering use of information technology with the 
Sabre reservations system, but the company has struggled to turn a proﬁ t 
in recent years and ﬁ nally declared bankruptcy in 2011.
Business models are less a strategy than a way of understanding 
the world and optimizing an entity’s place in that world. As a cognitive 
“operating system,” as it were, business models must be widely under-
stood and internalized by both employees or others inside the organi-
zation and by customers or other outsiders. For example, the Zappos 
culture, and its maniacal focus on customer service, is inextricably con-
nected to the business’s margin structure, which is premised on minimal 
discounting.
Similarly, Apple’s App Store model provides an illustration where 
an idea rapidly took hold, enabling Apple to create a textbook example 
of a two-sided platform. (See Chapter 5.) No technologies were consid-
ered breakthrough: iTunes had conditioned people to download con-
tent and established a micropayment storefront, and the iPhone was well 
established (in the United States particularly) at the device level. But the 
business model change in how software was innovated and delivered to 
customers generated an entirely new industry, altering standard assump-
tions about channels, pricing, and developers.5
Henry Chesbrough, a business school professor now at the University 
of California, Berkeley, has studied business models for more than a 
decade. When looking at the path of technologies to market, he con-
tends that these cognitive frameworks turn out to be as important as, if 
not more important than, the content of the technology itself. Nowhere is 
this more true than in the case of new (or what Harvard professor Clayton 
Christensen has elsewhere called “disruptive”) technologies: “[T]he tech-
nological management literature shows that ﬁ rms have great difﬁ culty 
managing innovations that fall outside of their previous experience, where 
their earlier beliefs and practices do not apply.” Chesbrough continues by 
noting that “Authors do not agree . . .   whether the roots of that difﬁ culty 
lie in characteristics of the technology itself, the management processes 
employed to manage it, or the means used to access the surrounding 
resources.”6
Disruptive Innovation
In each of the ﬁ ve industries discussed in subsequent chapters, at least 
part of the upheaval has been caused by one of Christensen’s disruptive 
innovations. His model, which is nearly 15 years old, continues to explain 
parts of the technology and business landscape particularly effectively, so 
it is worth revisiting.

Disruptive Innovation 
167
In normal times, innovations can accumulate gradually. Christensen 
calls this “sustaining” innovation, where the basic parameters are perhaps 
enhanced by a new ﬂ avor, or new packaging, or improved performance.7 
Eventually in technology markets particularly, improvements eventually can 
outrun the capacity of the market to exploit them (for example, the over-
whelming functionality of Microsoft Word, or 3-gigahertz Intel processors 
for people who do word processing and e-mail, not video transcoding). 
This tendency toward overshoot can be accentuated by so-called lead-
user analysis, taking the point of view of “power users” as representative. 
Sustaining innovation is also a prime candidate for the trap of focus groups, 
which routinely both assert that they would pay for a new feature and deny 
the attractiveness of features that prove to be popular in the marketplace.
Sometimes, at the same time that sustaining innovation outruns mar-
ket requirements, a new offering appears in the market. Disruptive inno-
vations “fail” when compared head to head with an incumbent: Portable 
ultrasound machines lack the resolution and ﬂ exibility of conventional 
hospital-grade units, for example. But the disruptive innovation addresses 
a related set of user needs, without the heavy overhead and often at a 
radically low price: The portable ultrasound may cost only 5% of the 
incumbent. ING Direct introduced online banking that began with only 
simple savings accounts, limited physical branch structure, and exten-
sive self-service technologies: It “failed” on complex products, in-person 
customer service, and certain types of convenience and reassurance. But 
the low infrastructure costs allowed ING Direct to pay well-above-market 
interest rates, making competition difﬁ cult for providers with expensive 
asset bases and complex processes to administer.
The combination of ease of use, low cost, and new competitive 
bases often allows the disruptive innovation to gather rapid market share 
growth, as in the case of MP3 audio ﬁ les relative to physical compact 
discs: Audio ﬁ delity may have been lower, but price, convenience, selec-
tion, and speed of distribution (given Napster and similar peer-to-peer ser-
vices) were all superior.
A further factor in disruptive innovation relates to scale. What start 
out as niche markets are unappealing to large organizations, which (1) 
may already market a competing incumbent product and “know” nobody 
would want the less powerful offering, (2) resist both distraction from 
“core competences” and resource drains from proven winners, and (3) set 
high thresholds for return on investment and market size. Under a previ-
ous leadership team, managers at one large consumer products company 
stated that projected markets smaller than $100 million simply weren’t 
worth pursuing.
That ﬁ rm has now revised its managers’ earlier assumption and found 
billion-dollar markets for new, disruptive products that started below that

Business Model Overview
$100 million threshold. New technologies with (initially) small markets usu-
ally require small organizations, with tolerance for ambiguity, lean infra-
structures, and low resistance to change as the business model evolves.8
Disruptive Innovation as Paradigm Shift
Christensen’s many examples of disruptive innovation hold much in com-
mon with the cognitive transition explained by Thomas Kuhn in his land-
mark book, The Structure of Scientiﬁ c Revolutions.9 Kuhn’s “normal” science 
parallels sustaining innovation; the breakthrough, or “paradigm shift” 
in Kuhn’s model, occurs with a change in mind-set rather than a brilliant 
invention. HP’s pricing of inkjet printers to lock users in to high- margin 
resupply purchases of ink in proprietary packaging is a classic business 
model innovation that originated with a lifetime view of customer proﬁ tabil-
ity (as well as some historical reﬂ ection on King Gillette), not in a lab.
Kuhn’s paradigm shift is a change in the collective mind of a com-
munity: “[D]uring [scientiﬁ c] revolutions scientists see new and different 
things when looking with familiar instruments in places they have looked 
before. . . .   [P]aradigm changes do cause scientists to see the world of 
their research-engagement differently.”10 The same thing happens in dis-
ruptive innovation. Facebook Photos disrupt Kodak’s physical (and even 
digital) printing business because the problem shifts from having photos 
to sharing them. Unmanned aerial vehicles focus on delivering weapons 
and surveillance capability where they are needed instead of investing 
heavily in evasive maneuverability (and a pilot) as the key asset.
It is difﬁ cult to overemphasize the point that cognitive reframing of 
the customer value proposition and the proﬁ t formula, in particular, con-
stitute critical elements of successful technology deployments. Online 
grocery, for example, was dismissed as impossible, given the low mar-
gins of traditional grocery and the high costs of personalized picking 
and delivery. But if compared instead to pizza delivery (characterized 
by 50%  margins, higher with beverages and side dishes), online grocery 
potentially can work if the key processes are designed according to deliv-
ery-centric rather than selection-centric criteria.
Looking Ahead
Every enterprise, from a lemonade stand on up, has a business model. 
In rapidly changing technology-driven markets in particular, however, it 
is not always clear that a ﬁ rm has the business model it needs. For all the 
billions of dollars spent on research and development, many patents and

other innovations fail to make it to market. As we study the ﬁ ve indus-
tries highlighted in the coming chapters, it becomes clear that mind-set 
and preconceptions matter decisively in most disruptions: Time and again, 
competitive rules of engagement, margin structures, and customer behav-
ior were taken as given or as an entitlement. (The music industry resisted 
attempts to unbundle music from the album format, for example, even 
though consumers wanted songs they liked rather than a collection that 
included too many songs they didn’t.)
To make business model change real, in addition to labs full of PhD 
scientists, many companies need change agents, people with ﬂ exible out-
looks who can see problems from multiple perspectives. They also need 
to devise market solutions every bit as innovative as the hardware, mol-
ecules, or user experience. Finally, these change agents must be capable 
of that most difﬁ cult of tasks: changing other people’s minds.

CHAPTER 16
Data and Communications
The business model for U.S. telephony has undergone not one but a complex series 
of disruptions in the past 15 years. Technological innovation was certainly a factor, 
but demographics, regulation, and organizational dynamics both inside and around the 
carriers also played their parts in the drama. With anything so vast, old, and techno-
logically complex, it is impossible to summarize without losing important facets that 
often are the subject of book-length monographs in and of themselves. One example 
was the carriers’ yellow-pages publishing business. In many ways the forerunner to 
Google, commercial telephone directories were a $14 billion business in 1995, bigger 
than the entire recording industry. Furthermore, unlike newspapers (roughly $50 bil-
lion in 2000) or music, the telecommunications sector is a sprawling, regulated, but 
rapidly evolving complex that is particularly difﬁ cult to change. In addition to being 
complicated, telecommunications companies are big, representing about 3% of the 
global economy.
Evolution of the Incumbent Business Model, 1877–1996
From the founding of the Bell Telephone Company, the U.S. telecommu-
nications sector has been characterized by a combination of technologi-
cal innovation (much of it still relating to Alexander Graham Bell’s master 
patent, #174465) and creative, intensive capital formation. Once Bell 
Telephone was bought by AT&T in 1899, it enjoyed essentially monopoly 
status. Indeed, a key feature of the history of American telephony is the 
ongoing role played by regulators concerned about anticompetitive behav-
ior, consumer protection, pricing, and taxation. The operating assumption

Data and Communications
from the World War I period forward was that building multiple wireline 
networks was infeasible; AT&T and its successor companies were treated 
as a “natural monopoly” for decades.
Technological innovation was intertwined with the business model 
from the outset. In 1913, for example, AT&T acquired the patent rights to 
a new type of vacuum tube that exhibited superior performance in ampli-
fying voice signals. The technology in turn enabled AT&T to strengthen 
the performance and lower the cost of long-distance carriage. In 1925, 
AT&T created Bell Labs to formalize its commitment to research and 
development.
The company was exceptionally good at research, having an impor-
tant claim in the invention of the transistor,* radio astronomy,† the photo-
voltaic cell, the laser, the UNIX operating system, and the C programming 
language; AT&T also commissioned the Telstar communications satel-
lite. The record of commercialization of this research was far less distin-
guished, however.
The expenses for funding this prodigious lab derived from the reg-
ulated monopoly revenues: 50 state regulatory bodies and the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC; for interstate commerce) set tariffs 
and tax rates that guaranteed the private company a comfortable return on 
the huge investment it had made in what eventually became nearly uni-
versal service to the vast majority of American households; U.S. wireline 
penetration was the highest of any major country in the world. As of 1970, 
for example, three times as many U.S. households had service compared 
to Ireland or France, measured by teledensity.
Not only was phone service universal, it was exceptionally reliable. 
Beginning with the leased phone and extending into the heart of the 
network, AT&T made its own equipment through its Western Electric 
subsidiary. Because competition was not an issue, there was no pressure 
to cut costs. Rather, equipment was engineered as an end-to-end closed 
system and built to higher standards than are typically available on an 
open market. As a result, wireline phone service in the United States 
had up to “six nines” availability: 99.9999% uptime means only about 
30  seconds of outage per year.
Phone calls were billed on the basis of elapsed time, in min-
utes rounded up, and distance between calling parties, with lower 
prices available to consumers outside of business hours. Under circuit 
* Bell Labs’ John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley shared a Nobel 
Prize in physics for the discovery.
† Bell Labs’ Arno Penzias won a Nobel Prize in physics for helping discover what 
later was identiﬁ ed as the radio remnant of the Big Bang.

switching, the same technology pioneered by Bell, two calling parties 
hold a physical connection for the duration of a call in much the same 
way that a switch closes connecting the batteries and a bulb on a ﬂ ash-
light. (Actually, two circuits are occupied, one for the voice transmis-
sion and one for the call setup and billing system.) For both circuits, 
edge devices (telephones, typically) are “dumb,” and the intelligence 
to do things like call waiting or caller identiﬁ cation lies in the network. 
The extra value of a dedicated connection over greater distance was 
taken as article of faith, and since rates were set by governments and 
the service was a monopoly, customers could do little except complain 
about the power of “Ma Bell:” At its peak before the 1984 divestiture, 
AT&T was the biggest company on earth, employing more than one 
million people.
In 1974, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) began antitrust pro-
ceedings against AT&T, which had only recently been forced to allow 
non-AT&T devices (such as early data modems) to connect to its net-
work. In addition, and not part of the DOJ action, MCI was the ﬁ rst 
company apart from AT&T allowed by the FCC to sell point-to-point 
long-distance service to businesses. An agreement was reached in 1982 
to break AT&T into seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs, 
known shortly thereafter as R-Bocks) that provided local service, and a 
long-distance company retaining the AT&T name (along with the Western 
Electric manufacturing operation) that would compete with MCI and 
Sprint. The breakup occurred in 1984.
In the aftermath, AT&T reduced long distance rates by 40% over six 
years, though local carriers added access charges that prevented consumers 
from seeing all of the cost reduction. The local operating companies (led 
by Ameritech, beginning in the Chicago area that was home to Motorola, 
which helped develop the radio technology) also began offering mobile 
service in the 1980s after it had been developed by Bell Labs.
By 1990, packet switching (see Chapter 24) had begun to emerge as 
the Internet began its rapid scale-up: The data to be transmitted are broken 
up into packets, which are moved over a robust mesh of connections one 
packet at a time following different paths, and reassembled by a “smart” 
edge device (a computer rather than a phone) upon receipt. The transition 
to a “dumb” network ran completely counter to Bell engineering experi-
ence and doctrine. In addition, mobile telephony entered its modern phase 
in the early 1990s with so-called 2G (roughly, second generation wireless) 
networks. Nokia patented handset technology to sense signal strength and 
reduce transmission power accordingly, thereby improving battery life dra-
matically, which helped fuel cellular growth.
All of this helped set the stage for the Telecommunications Act 
of 1996. Local telecoms were ordered to supply access to their lines at

a government-mandated price, enabling a vast number of upstart phone 
companies to compete with the RBOCs using, in many cases, Bell infra-
structure, which was leased at attractive rates. The Competitive Local 
Exchange Carriers (CLECs, pronounced “See-Lex”) proliferated, numbering 
30 in 1996 and growing to more than 700 in just four years.
Business Model Disruption, 1996–2010
But a funny thing happened in the aftermath of the Telecom Act: Millions 
of U.S. customers stopped wanting location-dependent copper-wire 
voice telephony. Untethered from physical wires, the notion of a “natural 
monopoly” based on the perceived inefﬁ ciency of multiple connections 
from competing carriers no longer obtained. The very asset that was regu-
lated from natural monopoly to shared resource began to lose its attrac-
tiveness after more than a century of becoming essential. Beginning with 
cellular voice, expanding to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and then 
in the mobile smartphone/tablet boom of the late aughts, new ways of 
connecting to people and information made the old universal infrastruc-
ture a liability rather than an asset.
Think of the math in a simple illustration. In 1990, say, copper phone 
lines pass 100 houses, and maybe 95 of those households subscribe. The 
costs of maintaining the physical plant, repairing it after storms, and issu-
ing and collecting bills are shared by 95 customers. Fast forward to 2010. 
The physical plant is 20 years older, municipalities are taxing phone com-
panies’ physical switching ofﬁ ces and sometimes even phone poles, and 
the costs of maintaining the infrastructure are now being borne by only 
45 customers. Raising the monthly charges is scarcely an option for both 
competitive and regulatory reasons, so the wireline operations of the 
Bell operating companies (the rebranded AT&T, Verizon, and Qwest) are 
underperforming. Most of the CLECs have disappeared.
Despite (or perhaps because of) being some of the oldest tech ﬁ rms 
on earth, telecoms had a tumultuous decade.
 
 Customers defected from landline service at staggering rates: accord-
ing to the Telecommunications Industry Association, U.S. landline 
subscriptions declined by more than 20 million in the ﬁ ve years 
to 2005, and perhaps another 10 million since then, as Figure 16.1 
illustrates.
 
 Technical developments, such as dense wave division multiplexing, 
made infrastructure investments in ﬁ ber optics stretch farther, and new 
revenue sources—particularly texting and ringtones for the carriers’ 
mobile operations—helped offset the wireline decline.

 Furthermore, perhaps the most troubling competitor—Skype and its 
200 million users of nearly free international calling—was itself a major 
headache to eBay, which failed to monetize its original $2.6 billion 
investment and therefore cost chief executive Meg Whitman her job.
Three external transitions hit the industry in parallel.
First, analog switched circuits over copper gave way to digital packet-
switched data applications over networks connected through air or ﬁ ber 
optics. Analog data transmissions (faxes, particularly internationally) were 
a lucrative revenue source that digital e-mail helped decimate. Voice went 
from being the whole of the value proposition to being just another appli-
cation, and one less appealing than text for the younger demographic. 
(See Figure 16.2.) Networks had to be redesigned and rebuilt: Verizon bet 
more than $20 billion on connecting individual premises to ﬁ ber optics, a 
far more expensive architecture than the cable operators’ coaxial cabling 
or AT&T’s ﬁ ber-to-the-neighborhood topology, but one with much greater 
capacity. In rural areas with low population density, meanwhile, sale of 
the wireline voice infrastructure is often an attractive option to RBOCs 
where buyers for voice networks can be found.
Second, mobile phones began as replications of their ﬁ xed-line coun-
terparts but rapidly evolved, with texting in particular, but also with the 
personalization expressed by ringtones. Having a number associated with

a person and not a location is a signiﬁ cant change. Even at the level of the 
country code, dialing 81 is no guarantee whatsoever that the person who 
answers will be in Japan. To the extent that the former monopolies had 
to make competitive claims after a century of regulated monopoly status, 
the advantages of Bell wireline service (reliability and ubiquity) were not 
claims that could be made for mobile service.
Finally, Bell companies went from being regulated to . . .   still being 
regulated. On one hand, they face competition from cable operators and 
mobile service; at the same time, they must adhere to sometimes arbitrary 
decisions by state and federal regulators, using sometimes outdated logic 
or data, as to how to run their business. Put another way, the core compe-
tencies of being a successful regulated monopoly are not those of a battle-
hardened competitive ﬁ rm. Changing the organizational size, shape, and 
culture to be competitive, in several senses of the word, remains an ongo-
ing challenge for AT&T and Verizon.
At the level of internal business strategy, voice telephony had both 
competitor businesses (particularly cable operators offering VoIP voice in 
a voice-video-Internet bundle as well as such providers as Vonage) and 
Skype, which, like Linux, could not be beaten by undercutting prices, lit-
igation, or acquisition. Trying to preserve voice revenue, compete with 
Comcast and other cable operators, and deal with free as a viable price 
point (albeit one with some interconnect charges) made life especially dif-
ﬁ cult for the telecom ﬁ rms and potential insurgents alike. To take only 
one example, eBay took on many attributes of a bank with the brilliant 
PayPal acquisition, but the connection of voice communications to off-
price auctions is far less strategically obvious. Put another way, given the 
size, legacy, and regulatory constraints of telecoms compared to eBay, it’s

difﬁ cult to see a better path forward that these far less nimble and entre-
preneurial companies should have followed.
Implications of “Stupid” Networks
David Isenberg, formerly a business innovation researcher at AT&T, 
helped identify what he called the “paradox of the best network” in the 
Internet age. He built on an insight from the astute investment analyst 
Roxane Googin, who noted in 2001 that “the perfect network is perfectly 
plain, and perfectly extensible. That means it is also the perfect capital 
repellant, [which] implies a guaranteed loss to network operators, but a 
boon to the services on the ‘ends.’”1 This thinking that emerged from the 
success of the Internet ran counter to most everything that had worked for 
the Bell companies for a century:
 
 Intelligence at the edges, in computers or similar devices, relied on a 
“stupid” (Isenberg’s famous word from his samizdat paper* of 1997) 
network in the middle that does only one thing: move bits.† Bell net-
works had stupid edge devices connected by a smart network that 
could bill for a call, forward that call to a preprogrammed number, or 
connect relatively conveniently to various forms of government sur-
veillance systems.
 
 Intelligence at the edge allowed for innovation to proliferate. The 
people running the network core, meanwhile, were very good at their 
jobs, but this excellence precluded them from changing anything at 
all dramatically. Unsurprisingly, Bell Labs engineers “knew” that the 
Internet would not work when they were ﬁ rst presented with its early 
theories and bypassed an opportunity to build it.2
 
 Stupid networks do not differentiate their trafﬁ c; smart networks know 
quite a lot about the two parties on the ends as well as what is pass-
ing between them.
 
 Moore’s law3 meant an exponential pace of innovation in computer-
related industries, including data networking: Dense wave division 
multiplexing, a technology for dividing light into component colors, 
each of which carries signal, allowed 16-fold improvements in the 
*Underground transmission of ofﬁ cially prohibited texts, from the Russian system 
of government under which transmission was common.
† The Internet is not really as “stupid” as it might seem: Routing algorithms have 
grown quite sophisticated in analyzing optimal trafﬁ c patterns, particularly related 
to extreme variation in demand.

1990s. The Bell system, in contrast, doubled in performance once a 
century, according to one industry wit.
Looking Ahead
Most critically for the Bell companies, losing the very things implied by a 
smart network—distance-based billing, or billing of any sort, for starters—
challenged the business model at its essence. Recall our starting point: A 
business model is a cognitive commitment that makes a variety of behav-
iors possible in part by belief. With voice service, the legacy carriers face 
substantial dislocation as they confront the implications of a communica-
tions network that broke every rule that had helped build the best voice 
service, and the biggest company, on the planet.

CHAPTER 17
Software Business Models
The business model disruption framework as it applies to software has multiple layers: 
Platforms have changed and are changing; enterprise and personal computing mar-
kets differ signiﬁ cantly; and the division of labor among operating systems, network 
services, and application software is also in ﬂ ux. For our purposes, let’s look at the 
case of Microsoft, insofar as it was a dominant player in software markets through 
most of the 1990s. How did Internet-related events and trends disrupt its business 
model?
Incumbent Model Pre-2000
Back when investors were looking for “the next Microsoft,” they held certain 
assumptions about what a highly successful software company looked like.
Customer Value Proposition
The value proposition for Windows in the 1990s was compelling: If you 
want to do any of the many wonderful things computers can allow you to 
do, we are the only game in town. Apple was a niche provider with tiny 
market share and high prices because of the proprietary hardware-software 
relationship. For a time, IBM’s OS/2 operating system had some technical 
advantages over Windows, but IBM never established the application eco-
system that would make its OS competitive. No other platforms were cred-
ible after the semihobbyist and cult brands of the 1980s, such as Amiga, 
were sufﬁ ciently marginalized.
Once you bought a computer with the Windows OS, by 1995 there 
were no real alternatives for ofﬁ ce productivity applications. In this

complementary market, MS Ofﬁ ce became the default choice, for both PCs 
and Macs, where it held even higher market share than on the PC. (On 
the PC at the time, WordPerfect still had pockets of loyal customers—in 
law ﬁ rms, for example.)
Software was available on various types of plastic discs and was sold 
as a tangible product directly to the user (or her employer). As product 
companies, software vendors cared about software functionality and per-
formance; data as they were generated or managed by the application 
fell out of scope. Both desktop and laptop computers were used sitting 
still, plugged into a hard-wired network when they were near the correct 
wall jack.
Proﬁ t Formula
Software platform leadership requires the development of mechanisms for 
user lock-in and network effects. Word processing programs stand as an 
obvious example, where switching is hard and expensive once you learn 
to use a package, and it makes sense to be on the same product as all of 
your coworkers if document sharing is a priority.
Software upgrade cycles delivered sustained proﬁ tability: That locked-
in user base eventually had to buy the new, improved version, particularly 
after support was withdrawn or new functionality (for example, Wi-Fi in 
which 802.11A didn’t work with 802.11B) was not backward compatible. 
Upgrades delivered a major revenue infusion to the software seller and 
perhaps the wider ecosystem.
For both OSs and applications, preventing digital copying of the assets 
was essential to maintaining pricing power. (See Chapter 4).
Technical support costs had to be kept low or, ideally, turned into a 
proﬁ t center.
Key Resources
Microsoft sold software to large customer bases one consumer or one 
business at a time. This reality of the market implies effective manage-
ment of brand, retail channels, and enterprise sales forces. Retail channels 
such as CompUSA, Computer City, Micro Center, and others were impor-
tant points of contact (and both formal and informal training) between 
the big hardware and software brands and the customer. Dell’s direct 
model grew in inﬂ uence through the 1990s but did not triumph until 
later.
An enthusiast magazine community helped users overcome their 
fear of ignorance in the face of complex language, purchase criteria, and 
user experience. These magazines, while not belonging to Microsoft,

performed important functions: The implicit user question, Which com-
puter should I buy?, was always answered by “a machine running 
Windows,” marginalizing the differences between, say, Toshiba and 
Gateway.
Strong technical teams matter: Once functionality is speciﬁ ed early 
(by market-facing product teams) in the new product development cycle, 
it must be hard-coded into the package. At Microsoft, feature inclusion 
apparently mattered more than security, stability, or reliability, but switch-
ing costs were sufﬁ ciently high, and alternatives scarce, that those draw-
backs had few consequences for market share.
Key Processes
Software development was clearly essential to Microsoft’s growth and con-
tinued market power. One challenge grew out of the fact of the sheer 
size of the code base: The Vista operating system reportedly contained 
50 million lines of code. Achieving usability, debugging, consistent secu-
rity architectures, and performance tuning at that scale is difﬁ cult or even 
impossible.
As a platform play in a heterogeneous ecosystem, Microsoft had to 
maintain working relationships with a wide variety of ﬁ rms and organi-
zations. Standards bodies and other forms of intercompany relationship 
building had to be managed to ensure the success of interoperability, 
brand consistency, investment effectiveness, and other objectives. Industry 
analysts (such as IDC) had to be kept abreast of the status of the platform; 
consumer product branding was insufﬁ cient to ensure enterprise adoption, 
particularly of server and development environments.
As big as Microsoft was (and remains), it could not address all the 
particular uses to which the software would be put. Building, certifying, 
and nurturing an independent software developer community helped put 
Windows systems into small businesses, corporate environments, schools, 
and other institutions. Developers, in turn, required tools, templates, 
frameworks, education, marketing materials, and many other forms of 
support in order to be effective.
Business Model Disruption after 1998
Whether one looks at Google—a clear challenger to Microsoft’s  dominance—
or at Apple, Facebook, or Linux (not a company at all), many of the 
 assumptions about the Microsoft model no longer hold true. Greatness 
in  software now requires a lot of the old-world programming skills and 
 positioning, plus a healthy dose of some new elements.

Software Business Models
To set some context, Table 17.1 looks at some familiar companies 
listed by market capitalization and price/earnings (P/E) ratio as of late 
2010 compared to 10 years before, at the end of 2000.
Note that Salesforce, the exemplar of software as a service, is valued 
at 20 times Microsoft’s P/E ratio. Microsoft’s market capitalization, mean-
while, grew less than 8% in a decade. In addition, as of 1998, anyone 
looking for “the next Microsoft” probably would not have looked to 
Viacom or Disney as models. And for good reason: The role of “pushed” 
content remains in transition more than a decade later. Yet so-called 
shrinkwrap business models emphasizing software as a physical product 
often sold by the number of users or “seats” are in rapid decline while the 
core of the media-industry model—the packaging of audiences for sale 
to advertisers—is fueling growth at Google, presenting both technical and 
cultural challenges at Yahoo!, being rewritten at Facebook, and the source 
of deep concern among Microsoft’s top leadership.1
The changing of the guard is further emphasized by Microsoft’s recent 
experience with old-school software, its Vista operating system. The 
product shipped three years late, with a stripped-down feature set, and 
effectively cost several senior executives their jobs. It never sold in large 
numbers, in part because enterprise buyers refused the trade-offs of cost, 
risk, and performance that it offered. Windows 7 sold better but garners 
little press recognition or industry buzz: It has many attributes of a utility 
or an appliance, while strong market presence and growth are the hall-
marks of Facebook, Apple, and, in mobile particularly, Google. In con-
trast, Microsoft’s mobile software platform has yet to generate momentum, 
although the company’s landmark alliance with Nokia will certainly bear 
watching here.
What are the emerging dynamics for software dominance? Compared 
to the standards for success circa 1997, a few factors have been inverted 
while most still hold true, albeit with a twist.

Product versus Service
In the majority of cases, nobody wants a product for what it is. (Diamonds 
and other luxury goods are obvious exceptions.) Rather, we want the 
capabilities delivered by the product: Knives slice food, cars provide 
transportation, and cameras deliver memories. When people buy soft-
ware for what it does, there are numerous advantages to not owning seat 
licenses (particularly unutilized ones), physical artifacts such as discs or 
manuals, physical server hardware, physical data centers, or even physi-
cal storage. At the enterprise level, Microsoft has not suffered as directly 
from the presence of Salesforce.com as have Oracle and SAP, but the 
Salesforce model is helping people change their mind-sets: Recall that a 
business model is in large measure a cognitive commitment rather than 
a written document or legal status. At the personal level, Google’s search, 
applications, maps, and mail/storage prove their utility daily to tens of mil-
lions of users. Software as a product is getting to be a more difﬁ cult sell.
The conception of software as a service rather than a product was 
advanced by the open-source community in the late 1990s. Understanding 
the difference between the use value and the sales value of software, par-
ticularly for custom enterprise applications, helped provide intellectual 
legitimacy for Apache, Linux, and others. As Eric Raymond, the author 
of the open-source manifesto The Cathedral and the Bazaar, put it, 
“[S]oftware is largely a service industry operating under the persistent but 
unfounded delusion that it is a manufacturing industry.”2
Platforms
Rather than developing for UNIX, Windows, Mac OS, Symbian, set-top 
boxes, and a variety of other OSs, Google and Amazon have led the way 
toward development of services for the Internet as a platform. Among 
other things, this stance greatly simpliﬁ es product distribution: The differ-
ences between today’s Google Maps and a 1998 version of Rand McNally’s 
Windows package are striking. Every time a new road was paved, or 
interstate exits were renamed, or a pedestrian mall was built, millions 
of CDs became obsolete. In contrast, Google (or NAVTEQ or whatever) 
makes one change to the base map and every subsequent query will be 
addressed with accurate information.
Getting the platform right still matters, but the deﬁ nition of the term is 
changing from local to virtual, solitary to distributed, and product to envi-
ronment. Furthermore, platform heterogeneity is a reality: Mobile devices 
and PCs, tablets and set-top boxes, and even automobiles are semi- 
integrated, so user identities, data, and preferences must move seamlessly

back and forth. Google runs across platforms, following the user, perhaps 
better than any major software vendor, while Microsoft remains heavily 
desktop-centric, not to mention Microsoft-centric.
Lock-in
The lock-in aspect still concerns Wall Street analysts, particularly because 
switching costs can be so low. If I change from Yahoo! Finance to, say, 
Fidelity’s investor workbench, apart from my investment in learning the 
old interface, there’s very little to restrain me from leaving. Tim O’Reilly, 
who helped formulate the very notion of Web 2.0*, asserts that users 
should own their data in these sorts of scenarios, but the exceptions to his 
assertion prove that Web 2.0 is hardly the last word. A person’s eBay rep-
utational currency, iTunes preferences, and Facebook proﬁ le are neither 
open nor portable—by design. Google owns search history and mobile 
search location; Amazon owns search, review, and purchase history; 
cloud e-mail providers own substantial clues about identity. Data has thus 
become a new mode of lock-in, joining application compatibility, learning 
investments, and long-term licensing.
Network Effects
There’s no question that successful software still exploits network 
effects. The more developers who code to a given platform—Facebook, 
Salesforce, or Google Maps—the more that standard gains authority: Note 
that none of those aforementioned businesses counts only as a Web site. 
One of the platform pioneers powerfully illustrates the point perfectly: 
Amazon once noted in its earnings conference call that it had 265,000 
developers signed up to use its Web services, a huge number for a 
young technology. There are also powerful network effects among users, 
whether at eBay, MySpace, or such peer-to-peer content distribution ser-
vices as BitTorrent: The more people who use the service, the more valu-
able it becomes. Conversely, when people defect in large numbers, the 
ﬂ ywheel spins in reverse. Compare that one fact to consumer products, 
banking, automobiles, or pharmaceuticals, and we are reminded how sig-
niﬁ cantly online dynamics depart from those of widget business or even 
most of the service sector.
*Web 2.0 was a notion revolving around foundational changes from a static, broad-
cast model for the Web to a more dynamic, people-powered environment; user-
generated content is an essential component of the term. Key examples of the 
tendency include Flickr, Google Maps, Wikipedia, and Facebook.

Upgrade (and Therefore Revenue) Cycles
No longer is the objective to leverage a large installed base onto a new 
version of the product. Google makes money every hour of every day, 
and apart from acquisitions, we don’t expect spikes in its revenues. 
Indeed, the escape from the cyclicality of product upgrade cycles may 
not yet be fully appreciated as analysts assess the new breed of software 
companies. The dependence of shrinkwrap software companies (that 
sell software as a product) on secondary revenue streams may become 
problematic: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison noted in an interview with FT 
that his company was collecting 90% margins on software maintenance.3 
Customers can’t be, and aren’t, happy with those economics, so it is likely 
only a matter of time until competition and/or customer resistance change 
the model. SAP’s attempt to move into the cloud and “information appli-
ance” markets (where it encounters Sun+Oracle products) will be inter-
esting to watch insofar as it represents a departure from the company’s 
legacy business model.
Selling Software as a Product, One at a Time
Google once reported quarterly revenues that represented a year-over-
year improvement of 58%. Did its sales force grow by 60% in a year? 
Highly doubtful. Although the company offers a few software products a 
customer can purchase, enterprise search hardware and software, hosted 
applications, and geographic information system tools amount to mere 
drops in that $29 billion annual bucket. An important facet of the software 
as a service trend is that in an increasing number of cases, users don’t 
have the software on their own devices but access a server, the location of 
which is irrelevant, to get something done. As a result, the customer base 
(of advertisers) is dramatically smaller than the user base, which delivers 
favorable sales force performance metrics.
Accordingly, software distribution channels are being completely rein-
vented: The old goal used to be to get your product onto a shelf and/or 
catalog page at Computer City, Egghead, and MicroWarehouse. Note that 
all of those businesses are defunct, another indication of deeper change in 
the industry. In a related development that sheds further light on a com-
plicated situation, PC Magazine subscriptions and ad pages dropped to 
the point where it ceased paper publication in 2008.
Retail Channel
Because it owns neither the PC hardware layer nor a content distribu-
tion channel, Microsoft is caught in conﬂ icting trends here. Apple’s retail

Software Business Models
stores are a powerful presence for the linked hardware-software platform, 
bringing in about $10 billion a year. At the same time, the demise of the 
PC-centric format hit Microsoft particularly hard: Best Buy, with troubles of 
its own and where PCs are displayed alongside toasters, cannot replicate 
the capabilities of a CompUSA of years gone by, not to mention an Apple 
Genius Bar, with its nearly-ideal selling environment. Apple’s App Store/
iTunes format constitutes yet another competitive front. Finally, online dis-
tribution of free applications or services serves as another way that soft-
ware gets to users.
People Buy Features and Performance
There’s a wonderful video that embodies this thinking perfectly: Enter 
“microsoft ipod” into the YouTube search bar. Microsoft apparently pro-
duced this spoof internally, illustrating the trend toward “speeds and 
feeds” in stark contrast to Apple’s aura and powerful design sense. Just run 
down the standard old-school software questions in regard to Facebook or 
MapQuest:
 
 What is the recommended processor?
 
 How much free disk space is required?
 
 What is the minimum memory required?
 
 How many transactions per second can the application handle?
 
 How fast can the application render/calculate/save/etc.?
The very mention of these former performance criteria in regard to 
the most successful “applications” of our time highlights the discontinu-
ity between where we are and where we were. It’s critically important 
to note that the path from the PC-resident Lotus Organizer to Basecamp 
project management or the original Encarta CDs to Wikipedia involved a 
step-function change rather than evolutionary progression: Incremental 
improvements to existing products are often insufﬁ cient in times of radical 
innovation.
Hire the Best Technical Team
There’s no question that high-caliber architects and developers matter. Look 
at the arms race among Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Yahoo! to hire the 
giants of the industry. At the same time, Facebook is raiding Google for 
software engineers and managers by the hundreds. In addition, the outside-
in dynamic of user-generated content also allows such sites as Twitter or 
Facebook to thrive. In these kinds of businesses, it’s certainly imperative 
to get top-ﬂ ight operations and data-center professionals, no question, but

these folks are of a different breed compared to the breakthrough innova-
tors of the sort represented by Google’s Vint Cerf, Louis Monier (who spent 
time at AltaVista, eBay, and Google), and Gordon Bell at Microsoft.
The lowering of coordination costs facilitated by the Internet allows 
smart people to collaborate outside of institutions, as we saw in Chapter 9.4 
With a target on its back as the dominant ﬁ rm of the previous computing 
regime, Microsoft thus must compete on multiple fronts:
 
 Apple is proprietary, high margin, and design driven, a hardware+
software and ﬁ xed+mobile platform.
 
 Linux is free, user driven, organically evolving, and robust but ugly.
 
 Google is network-centric, mobility and geography-aware, with an ad-
driven revenue model.
Competitive positioning relative to three such different models of soft-
ware creation and distribution stands as a truly problematic proposition.
Rows and Columns
While I don’t want to oversimplify and assert that value has migrated from 
nodes to links, the fact remains that the structure of business, personal 
connections, and information is looking much more like a spiderweb than 
a library card catalog. As scholarship from Rob Cross at the University of 
Virginia and others has illustrated, informal networks of personal contacts, 
once exposed, often explain a corporation better than the explicit titles 
and responsibilities.5 At the engineering level, the very concept of social 
networking behind Twitter, Flickr, and Foursquare represents a departure 
from a conventional relational database mentality. The world as a radial 
graph is a very different proposition from trying to ﬁ t reality into cells in a 
preordained and ﬁ xed database schema.
Looking Ahead
The corporate architectures at Microsoft, Google, and Apple mirror their 
varying approaches to the market. For roughly a decade Apple’s share 
price included a healthy dose of respect for the management skill of Steve 
Jobs, in that particular context, to both envision and execute. Conversely, 
the achievement of Google, with the jury out on the model’s staying 
power, may lie in leadership’s balancing of individual brilliance at differ-
ent layers of the hierarchy with ﬁ nancially realistic corporate objectives. 
Finally, Microsoft appears to be working hard to deﬁ ne an emerging man-
agement model as the founding generation hands off to new leaders.

Software Business Models
Taken together, these tendencies are reshaping the software busi-
ness: Programming (as in putting content together on radio or television) 
has joined programming (as in coding) as a core competency for many 
kinds of businesses that fall in the gaps between computing and media. 
The fusion also shakes up conventional media, as we noted earlier. The 
purely push-based media model, used to advertise things primarily for 
largely unmeasurable brand impact (unmeasurable at the level of the ad, 
particularly), is being challenged by viewers and readers who want more 
participation in both the experience (what used to be called consump-
tion)6 and the process (formerly known as publishing or content creation). 
As blogs, social networks, and professional content get further jumbled, 
and as NewsCorp founder Rupert Murdoch seems to be intent on demon-
strating, the business models of media, software, gaming, and information 
transport will continue to become further intermixed.

CHAPTER 18
Music Business Models
The business model disruption framework as it applies to music has multiple moving 
pieces: Tastes change, attitudes toward intellectual property sharing differ signiﬁ cantly 
by demographic, and the place of recorded music in modern life is also in a period of 
deep transition. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which began 
as a standards body, became perhaps the most disliked lobbying group in the country 
by suing music lovers, which was a curious strategy, to put it charitably. Music is a 
small but visible industry (moving and storage was about the same size, but Mayﬂ ower 
never had the Grammy Awards), and it was also disrupted early in the Internet’s life 
cycle, before telecom or newspapers, for instance. How did  technology-related events 
and trends disrupt the music industry’s business model to such an extent that its trade 
association felt compelled to adopt such an extreme position?
Incumbent Model Pre-2000
It is tempting to say that Napster changed everything, and peer-to-peer 
(p2p) ﬁ le sharing is clearly a hugely important factor in the media land-
scape. It is not the only factor, however, and a series of services have in 
fact disappeared, sometimes permanently: In addition to Napster, Pirate 
Bay and Limewire have been subject to legal challenges. But as we will 
see, the music industry business model had a number of problems before 
the Napster watershed.
Customer Value Proposition
The goal before the Internet era was to sell physical artifacts that carry music: 
cassettes, long-playing (LP) records, compact discs. As platforms evolved,

record companies could sell the exact same content multiple times, which 
was one driving impetus behind the high-resolution formats that came to mar-
ket in the late 1990s: Super  Audio Compact Disc (SACD) and High Deﬁ nition 
DVD (HD-DVD). Unfortunately for the record labels, at the same time that 
Napster and later the iPod popularized MP3 ﬁ les, the audio-buying public 
was viewing SACD versus HD-DVD as a reprise of VHS-Betamax: People 
remembered buying machines that became worthless when the other stan-
dard emerged as dominant, making software, spare parts, and resale difﬁ cult. 
By the time Sony’s SACD format won the standards war, the market had little 
enthusiasm for music players that required a new form of physical media.
Proﬁ t Formula
Record companies recognized million sellers with gold records as far back 
as 1942, but it was in the period between 1970 and 1980 that the  industry 
saw huge sales of LPs: A handful of efforts from Michael Jackson, Pink 
Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, and other artists sold in excess of 
40  million copies over their lifetime. For a number of reasons, labels sought 
a 10-million-seller rather than ten 1-million-unit milestones: The indus-
try ﬁ rst became album driven (in that 8 to 12 songs were bundled into 
a 40-minute LP rather than being sold individually), then hit driven. The 
proﬁ t formula also was predicated on keeping artists in a disadvantaged 
position with regard to contract provisions and enforcement: Senator Orrin 
Hatch (a Utah Republican who has written more than 300 songs) once 
remarked that music is the only industry in which, after you pay off the 
mortgage, the bank still owns the house.1
Key Resources
Control of physical factories was essential: While pirate physical copies 
of LPs then CDs were available in some foreign countries, the complexity of 
manufacturing helped maintain the labels as an oligopoly. The labels 
viewed cassette taping with alarm in the 1970s, but the audio quality of 
tapes was inferior in most cases, as was the quality of the cover artwork, 
for which the LP format was ideally suited from a graphics perspective. 
Finally, the artist and repertoire function of discovering new bands was 
essential: Much like baseball scouts, certain individuals developed a track 
record in discovering successful new acts.
Key Processes
In addition to the supply chain of discovering talent, packaging albums, 
and distributing physical media, two other processes deserve  mention.

Touring was often an important tool for building support for a new 
release. Also, music is a prototypical information good insofar as it pres-
ents a sampling problem: The only way to know if you like a book, video 
game, movie, or song is to experience the artifact itself. Statistics, reviews, 
and word of mouth help, to be sure, but radio played a key role in solv-
ing the sampling problem for recorded music. Later, just at the dawn of 
the CD format, MTV pioneered the music video that performed a similar 
function. Getting a song onto radio and, later, cable television often made 
the difference between a hit and a miss. Not surprisingly, money and 
favors could be exchanged in this pursuit, most notoriously in the payola 
scandal that cost disc jockey Alan Freed (who coined the term “rock ’n’ 
roll”) his career in the 1950s, but also as recently as 2005, when then New 
York attorney general Eliot Spitzer settled out of court with three major 
labels, each of which paid a multimillion-dollar penalty.
Technology Evolution and Industry’s Response: The Case of 
Home Taping and MTV
In the late 1970s, the labels had succeeded in making disco music a 
perfect ﬁ t for the mass-distribution model. The problem was that the 
intense focus on the genre had run the industry into a cul-de-sac: 
As me-too acts multiplied, the American audience’s appetite for disco 
dropped sharply, and there were few acts of other styles in the pipe-
line. Despite this saturation, the industry focused its public relations, 
legal, and lobbying efforts on stigmatizing and if possible outlawing 
the practice of cassette recording. One industry campaign featured 
a cassette-shaped skull and crossbones with the tagline “Home tap-
ing is killing music.” Rather than exploiting this new, popular tech-
nology, labels fought it. The RIAA’s president claimed that for every 
album that was bought, another went unbought because of taping. 
The RIAA also claimed that 425 million hours of music were taped 
even though blank tape sales were only half of that total.
Record sales had fallen 11.4% in 1981 and were rumored to 
be headed for another double-digit decrease in 1982. That year 
Columbia Records alone ﬁ red 300 people from the label while such 
superstar acts as Blondie and Fleetwood Mac canceled tour dates.

and electronic drum machines into the American market, initially 
including British pop acts like Duran Duran and the Eurythmics 
that enjoyed huge success in the 1980s. The technology innova-
tion of replacing or augmenting the top-40 single with a cable TV 
music video changed the promotion landscape dramatically and 
introduced fresh “inventory” into the supply side of the music pipe-
line. In the end, the “crisis” in the music industry was not the fault of 
the tapers—who did not cease and desist even as the industry sub-
sequently logged unprecedented proﬁ ts—but had to a large extent 
resulted from stagnation in musical innovation at the major labels.
Michael Jackson’s Thriller LP is widely credited as the ﬁ rst release 
to consciously utilize the new MTV promotional medium (e.g., by hir-
ing commercial directors to make music videos as mini-movies): It 
sold between 26 and 40 million copies, depending on who’s count-
ing. At the same time, MTV’s technology further intensiﬁ ed the music 
business’s blockbuster economics that are in part responsible for the 
current situation. Being able to pass video costs on to the performer 
allowed labels to avoid confronting the vast potential of the new 
medium while limiting risk.
Business Model Disruption Pre-Napster
The 1990s witnessed at least a dozen changes to the music industry 
business model that helped set the stage for the knockout punch that 
Napster delivered. Any one by itself was not crippling but, en masse, 
these changes shifted the foundations of the industry sufﬁ ciently that 
labels were unable to respond to the challenge of p2p, in large mea-
sure because the customer value proposition was perceived to be unfair 
to both consumers and artists, who continued to enjoy favorable fan 
response.
 1. Piracy had become an issue. As of 2001, about a quarter of CDs 
sold worldwide were suspected of being counterfeit. The ease of 
copying CDs on personal computers was one impetus for the SACD 
and HD-DVD formats, which incorporated copy protection schemes 
that, much like the DVD, would eventually have been broken any-
way. At the turn of the century, the odds were less than 50% that 
a given CD was legitimate in such markets as China, Russia, and 
Brazil.

 2. As large-format retailers gained in scale in the 1990s, they did more 
to dictate what was stocked. Just as they did in other industries, 
Target, Best Buy, and Wal-Mart gained in power relative to their sup-
pliers, in this case both the labels and independent “rack jobbers” 
who stocked mom-and-pop operations. Such music-centric chains as 
HMV, Tower, and Wherehouse disappeared entirely.
 3. Those large-format retailers helped shift an industry institution, the top-
40 or Hot 100 list, to a more data-driven basis. In 1991, point-of-sale 
data replaced editors’ phone calls to a few retail buddies. Garth Brooks 
was an instant beneﬁ ciary: Country music was found to be seriously 
underrepresented in the informal lists. Market research replaced taste 
and intuition in signing artists, leading to a homogenization of styles 
around a few themes, hip-hop and country among them.
 4. Another factor led to a lack of fresh new acts. Reselling consumers 
the same music they had liked years or decades earlier was proﬁ t-
able and easy, particularly given favorable royalty arrangements in 
contracts that did not anticipate emerging formats. Music industry rev-
enue nearly doubled between 1989 and 1994, largely on the strength 
of back catalog sales.
 5. At the same time that nonmusic retailers increased their presence, 
radio was consolidating. Clear Channel came to own 11% of U.S. 
broadcast outlets but controlled 20% of ad revenue. Four broadcast 
groups controlled 63% of stations with a top-40 format. Once again, 
homogenization of musical genres, rather than diversity, was one 
outcome.
 6. Even as it struggled with its own business model, satellite radio chal-
lenged physical music providers for share of wallet. The extreme vari-
ety and high audio quality made Sirius and XM credible alternatives to 
owning a CD collection, particularly for automobile listening.
 7. MTV shifted its programming over time to the point where it seldom 
played new music videos. Meanwhile, the cost of producing a single 
music video, often borne by the artist, climbed to potentially more 
than $2 million.
 8. Touring became an attractive revenue stream, but it was also subject 
to industry consolidation. Eventually, the Ticketmaster-Live Nation 
merger of 2010 meant that venue owners confronted a powerful alli-
ance of concert booking and ticketing entities that could dictate 
terms. Clear Channel also operated in this market segment, leading to 
charges that radio airplay was being used as a negotiating tactic with 
non-Clear Channel promoters.
 9. Recording artists won congressional support for an overturn of work-
for-hire contact language that the RIAA had previously helped codify

into law. The language would have had the effect of denying artists’ 
claims to copyright, particularly as new formats emerged.
 10. The DVD, priced at about the same $16 point for which labels sold 
CDs, became the fastest-selling technology in U.S. history. In the four 
years after the format’s launch in 1998, DVD players outsold CD play-
ers 3:1.
 11. In another legal setback, the labels’ practice of setting minimum 
advertised prices (MAPs; very close to price ﬁ xing) was found to be 
illegal in 2003. Consumers were supposed to receive small checks, 
and the labels were supposed to donate music to nonproﬁ t institu-
tions. The loss was small monetarily, but at the time that the RIAA was 
suing its customers, the MAP verdict was further bad publicity, leading 
consumers to feel, rightly or wrongly, that they were being treated 
unfairly by the labels.
 12. Retailers speak of “share of wallet” and fast food franchises of 
“share of stomach.” Music’s “share of ear” diminished rapidly in the 
2000 time frame as cell phones grew rapidly in availability and use. 
Nextel, to take one example, reported that minutes per user per 
month increased 65% between 2001 and 2002, to 11 hours per month. 
Presumably some of this time had previously been spent listening to 
music.
 13. Similarly, the DVD and video game occupied part of the day for those 
aged 16 to 24 in particular, who a generation earlier were spending 
more time listening to music.
 14. Finally, the Internet, apart from its ﬁ le-sharing capabilities, constituted 
a diversion from traditional ways of ﬁ nding and listening to music.
These changes combined to create a slowdown: Compared to the 
doubling that occurred between 1989 and 1994, purchases of recorded 
music increased only an average of .4% per year between 1996 and 2002, 
as Figure 18.1 illustrates.
Business Model Disruption Post-Napster
Against the backdrop of so many challenges to the core business model, 
from stale inventory of new acts, to poor perception of the labels by con-
sumers, to heavy overhead in the cost structure of music production and 
distribution, Napster hit the industry like a lightning bolt: In November 
2000 alone, 1.75 billion songs were downloaded via the service. That 
number, annualized, projected to 21 billion songs, or about 1.5  billion 
CDs. In 2000, the U.S. retail channel moved about 1 billion CDs.

In essence, the “inferior” technology (with a poor interface, complicated 
naming conventions, and obvious audio inferiority) effectively surpassed 
the entire retail channel as a distribution mechanism in one year. In addi-
tion, it was a highly centralized system in contrast to later ﬁ le-sharing 
arrangements, but at its peak there were reportedly 25 million users and 
80 million songs, and the system never once crashed.
With public perception of the labels already low because they were 
perceived to be exploiting both customers and artists, ripping off the 
 companies was morally less complicated for college-age students than 
was, say, stealing books from a public library. When the labels began 
suing music lovers (or mistakenly suing people who did not listen to 
music), that perception took a further downturn. Meanwhile, the hold-
ing companies within which the labels resided were dissatisﬁ ed with 
their poor performance: Labels simultaneously faced pressure from artists 
long ill-served by standard contract practices, from listeners, from retailers 
that moved CD selling space to more proﬁ table ventures, and from their 
bosses.
Enter Apple, a company with a substantially more positive public per-
sona. The iPod was neither the ﬁ rst nor the most powerful MP3 player. It 
did employ systems thinking to create a seamless, easy user experience, 
and co-founder Steve Jobs’ background in Hollywood while at Pixar gave 
him familiarity with the entertainment industry. Here as elsewhere, the 
business model was more a shift in perception rather than a technology

breakthrough. As one industry analyst noted in 2002, “The music label 
executives we spoke with are so sure piracy is destroying their business, 
that they seemed strangely uninterested in the truth.”2 Apple was able to 
bridge the CD and MP3 models for a signiﬁ cant portion of the market by 
simultaneously satisfying the labels (in part with copy protection) and cus-
tomers (with ease of use, clever marketing, and hardware integration) in 
ways the labels by themselves could not.
Another brand play was being made by artists themselves. While the 
most common tactic is buying (or rerecording) one’s back catalog, other 
artists are releasing directly to various forms of download. Perhaps the 
most famous and successful episode for experiment was Radiohead’s 
experiment in name-your-own-price downloads, which let fans (legally) 
pay nothing for the album In Rainbows. While many paid nothing (or 
downloaded p2p copies), the average amount paid was £4 ($5.70 at the 
time). Once it was released in physical formats, the album sold 3 mil-
lion units in all formats; a limited edition box set of LPs and CDs with 
other extras sold 100,000 units at $80 apiece. Thus, the band conducted 
a real-world experiment in versioning information goods, letting the mar-
ket segment into multiple price tiers in exchange for varying bundles of 
value. The experiment has also never been successfully repeated, even 
by the same band.
By 2010, download sales, never on the scale of physical CD sales, 
had stagnated.3 Streaming services such as Pandora and Grooveshark 
were adding users at a rapid rate at the same time that iPod sales slowed 
(nearly a ﬁ fth between 2009 and 2010) in the face of smartphone and tab-
let adoption.
Touring remained big business: The 13 highest-grossing tours ever, 
each of which made more than $200 million in 2010 dollars, all occurred 
after 2001—in other words, after Napster. Signiﬁ cantly, nearly all (with the 
exception of the Backstreet Boys in 2001) were acts in their 40s or older: 
the Rolling Stones, U2, Cher, Madonna, the Police, and Bruce Springsteen, 
for example. Although so-called 360-degree deals are coming into favor 
(where the label helps promote, and takes a cut of, merchandise and tour 
revenues, for example), generally bands rather than labels keep most of 
the tour proﬁ t.
Because the hardware is locked down more tightly than CDs or 
DVDs, game platforms have generated surprising revenues for bands 
and labels: Inclusion of a track in a sports title or in Rock Band or 
another music game generates revenues, though labels typically are— 
unsurprisingly—unhappy with the royalty rates. In the three years after 
the launch of the plastic-guitar game genre, revenues were reported in the 
$2.3 billion range, but sales dropped rapidly when the fad passed; in 2010 
Viacom sold its music-games business, which like other console games

faced a major disruption of its own from low-tech social games such as 
FarmVille.
Looking Ahead
It’s hard to imagine an industry responding much worse than the record 
labels did when faced with such a signiﬁ cant challenge. Taking proﬁ t 
margins almost as a birthright, most decisions—including appeals for 
 legislation—were premised on maintenance of the status quo. Several 
decisions have proved crucial, most falling into the mind-set/worldview 
camp rather than a technology challenge per se:
 
 Customers resisted bundle pricing when they could emotionally iden-
tify the valuable assets in the bundle. Existing margins, however, 
became a baseline assumption even though Internet music distribu-
tion destroyed the logic for a physical package of multiple songs.
 
 Having limited contact with the consumers of their products, labels 
compounded the perception issue by suing users, planting corrupted 
ﬁ les in p2p networks, clinging to unrealistic pricing ($16.99 for a 
physical CD), and making other proﬁ t-driven moves that detracted 
from the user experience.
 
 Continuing to think of music as a product rather than a service inhib-
ited innovation along the lines of what worked for Apple, Pandora, 
Spotify, and other distributors of online music ﬁ les and streams. 
Even in 2011, innovation came from Amazon even as EMI, one of 
the remaining four major labels, bounced between reluctant owners: 
Citicorp repossessed the label from a private equity group whose debt 
to the bank went unpaid, then in turn sold pieces of it at a loss to 
Sony and Universal (part of Vivendi).
 
 Managing demographics in a taste-driven business is never easy, but 
the quest for megahits may preclude the development of an ecosys-
tem with varying levels of popularity (the so-called long tail) and pro-
liferation of niches.
For the music industry to recover even partially, online distribution 
will need to be managed in a seamless web of actors, channels, and audi-
ences. Live music, television, streaming, and licensing can all contribute 
to overall revenue. Both extreme localization and global megastars play a 
role in the ecosystem. Finally, the place of a music label in talent identiﬁ -
cation, content generation, and digital distribution needs to be redeﬁ ned 
from a blank sheet. Music matters to many people, but making it proﬁ t-
able for the various entities in the industry remains a challenge.

CHAPTER 19
News
News is a particular kind of business. Subject to some textbook examples of informa-
tion economics, newspapers at their best also enrich communities, sustain democra-
cies by speaking truth to power, and occasionally build family dynasties. The migration 
from paper to the Internet has proven particularly challenging, with implications for all 
three of those deﬁ ning characteristics.
Compared to old-school stockbrokers disintermediated by $10 trades or 
travel agents put out of business by online booking and electronic tickets, 
newspapers have been undone in other ways. The power of the tradi-
tional newspaper was its bundling, in economic terms, along two axes. 
First, subscriptions bundle content by time: Readers pay for daily deliv-
ery of papers whether they get read or not, for the sake of convenience. 
In addition, a daily paper contains bundled content that a given reader 
ignores: people of a certain age will remember how many hundreds of 
pages of a 1990s Sunday New York Times were thrown away untouched.
The sheer material wastefulness of the resource-intensive physical dis-
tribution model might have been an indicator that alternatives could ﬂ our-
ish. Incumbents, not surprisingly, included smart, informed editors and 
publishers, many of whom were pillars of their communities. That such 
highly esteemed men and women could preside over a wholesale disman-
tling of a century-old model in a few short years provides one reason why 
the transition of news is such a compelling story.
Incumbent Formula Pre-2005
Daily newspaper readership had been dented badly before, by the wide-
spread introduction of radio, then television. After the decline in the 
1940s, however, demographics helped stabilize the situation: As table 19.1

shows, circulation kept rising, on the strength of population growth, 
even as a smaller and smaller percentage of the population bought 
newspapers.
Figure 19.1 graphs the data from Table 19.1. Note that the drop-off in 
readership rates is hidden under population-driven circulation growth for 
several decades. Newspapers were underrepresented in the population in 
the aftermath of television especially, but the essentials of the business 
model did not change markedly.
That model was a classic two-sided platform. (See Chapter 5.) 
Newspapers aggregated audiences with advertising and the things adver-
tising could buy: foreign bureaus, improved color and layout, faster 
presses, and so on. Advertising-side revenue, particularly classiﬁ eds, subsi-
dized the subscriptions (by roughly 4:1), giving readers an attractive value 
proposition in that they received a product that cost more to produce than 
what they paid.
Customer Value Proposition
Newspapers could hire reporters and editors, subscribe to wire services, 
and print and distribute newspapers. Barriers to entry were high, and 
even in multipaper towns, one paper generally took the morning while 
the weaker one handled the less attractive afternoon business.* Monopoly 
dynamics applied: For depth (baseball box scores or stock tables), radio 
or television couldn’t compete, and newspapers were unchallenged 
*As urban congestion worsened in the 1970s and after, getting the trucks full of 
papers to delivery points was much more difﬁ cult than the task of distributing 
newspapers at 5:00 A.M.

in some categories of news. For local matters, such as zoning or school 
boards, television typically found the tedium of committee meetings and 
report ﬁ lings ill-suited for their 20 minutes at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. From 
an advertiser standpoint, the inﬁ nite capacity for classiﬁ ed ad inventory 
meant that used cars, apartment listings, or job postings were much bet-
ter suited to print than electronic media. This is, of course, a classic net-
work externality: Every additional help-wanted ad, or open house, makes 
the platform more valuable to both advertisers (which gain strength in 
numbers relative to other channels) and to customers, who become more 
likely to solve their search needs with one-stop shopping.
Proﬁ t Formula
Time-based bundling, better known as subscriptions, helped match pro-
duction to demand and generated less waste compared to more volatile 
newsstand sales. In cases where subscriptions were paid ahead of deliv-
ery, newspaper companies enjoyed steady revenue ﬂ ows and better work-
ing capital: Ink and newsprint and reporters’ salary and beneﬁ ts were to 
some degree paid for before they were consumed.
The bundling of material into sections meant that every newspa-
per enjoyed the luxury of subsidies: Classiﬁ ed ads cost essentially noth-
ing to produce but brought in handsome revenues, as did grocery store 
ads. Advertising in turn subsidized other efforts, such as foreign news

bureaus, which could not afford to pay their own freight. Bundling meant 
that no person typically read everything every day, but every reader 
could ﬁ nd something of interest. As long as ad revenues were sufﬁ cient 
to maintain the editorial side of the house, proﬁ ts were solid or even 
attractive.
Note in Figure 19.2 that for the New York Times Company, proﬁ ts 
were steady, with a dip during the early-1990s recession, from 1984 until 
2006, during which year the company took an $814 million write-down 
related to its Boston Globe and Worcester Telegram properties.
Key Resources
Given a newspaper’s status as a two-sided platform, running a news-
paper required parallel sets of resources. In fact, an article of faith 
among practitioners was the integrity of the separation between edi-
torial (reader-side customers) and advertising (commercial interests) 
functions. Ad sales, editorial-page positioning, and overall circula-
tion numbers were required to keep advertisers happy; quality report-
ing, good pictures, the right mix of syndicated comics, and heavy ad 
inventory in key segments (such as apartment listings or job postings) 
attracted readers. The more readers, the more advertising revenue. The 
more advertising, the more reporters and columnists, the more color 
pages, and the more coverage: Ideally, these enhancements led to still 
more readership.
Thus, the required resources were extensive, which helped raise bar-
riers to entry: reporters, editors, layout teams, pressmen, drivers, ad sales 
forces, human resource functionaries to deal with large staffs, and exten-
sive billing and customer service operations. Capital investment in presses, 
syndication memberships, and delivery ﬂ eets (not to mention oil-related

operating expenses for fuel and ink) made skilled ﬁ nancial management a 
requirement for long-term success.
Key Processes
Not surprisingly, those key resources performed obvious functions: 
Reporters reported and wrote, editors edited, pressmen printed, drivers 
delivered, sales reps sold, accountants counted. Skillful and attuned edi-
torial leadership could drive readership with good story selection, astute 
newswriting, and other effects of quality; the opposite could quickly alien-
ate a paper from its community.
Business Model Disruption
If the music industry’s problem was resisting the spread of free music via 
the Internet, the newspapers’ problem was in part caused by giving too 
much value away for too long. In addition, the threats came from multiple 
directions, in such large numbers and in such diversity that a focused stra-
tegic response was essentially impossible: As early as 1998 one consultant 
aptly referred to the process as “termiting.” Surprisingly, a prominent news-
paper industry report from 2009 preferred instead to blame a single villain.
Then the emergence of Google, an Internet search company that 
was launched without a business plan, soon blew up the content 
business into millions of “atomized” pieces, each piece disassoci-
ated at some level from its original context and creator. Like all the 
king’s men, news enterprises were left to put the Humpty Dumpty 
of editorial and commercial content back together again, restore 
their original integrity, and ﬁ nance the costly operation of being 
the trusted curator of news and transactions.1
This representation is somewhat disingenuous: “Financing the costly 
operations” of content creation and curation is still proﬁ table. As the 
Princeton historian Paul Starr points out, the average newspaper operating 
margin in late 2008 was 11.5%.2 The problem, however, is that percentage 
represents roughly a 50% drop from only six years prior, and the decline 
appears to be deepening. Accordingly, investor conﬁ dence in the future of 
the business model is plummeting: Newspaper stocks have been battered 
through good times and bad since 2005 or so.
Long before Google News, however, many of the bundled facets of a 
newspaper were separated out by stand-alone Web businesses, each tak-
ing some segment of the readership and unbalancing the former cross-
subsidies. Sports readers could go to the league sites (now with heavy

video footage), television spinouts from Fox/ESPN/CNN+Sports Illustrated, 
fan-driven blogs and/or message board efforts, or any number of sites 
updating them on favorite cricket, soccer, or other international sports the 
metro dailies can barely cover, if at all. The local geographic monopoly 
was broken.
News is still primarily gathered by the usual suspects but commented 
on, linked to, and reaggregated by everyone from Google News, to blog-
gers, to ideology-driven destination sites. Daily A–Z stock charts aren’t a 
particularly helpful way to watch the ﬁ nancial world, opening the door to 
broad distribution of previously professional-grade charting, archiving, and 
analytics; less professional message boards, blogs, and other mechanisms 
spread the wisdom (or lack thereof) of crowds.
At the same time and in a similar manner, the papers’ extremely prof-
itable ads were hit hard by multiple competitors. (See Figure 19.3.) eBay 
then later Craigslist took over the realm of random objects, Monster and 
others (including the hiring ﬁ rms directly) redeﬁ ned the help-wanted ﬁ eld, 
and Edmunds and Cars.com along with eBay Motors improved on the car-
buying experience by improving information availability and transparency. 
Match.com and eHarmony improved on the user experience and inventory 
levels of the personal ads, while real estate agents alone and in their trade 
association aggregated and augmented millions of property ads with pho-
tos, maps, and video walk-throughs. Online food-related sites proliferated,

all better at providing meal solutions than the once-a-week recipe page 
that accompanied the newspaper grocery ads.
In the end, most any page of a 1990s-era newspaper was challenged 
by an online outlet. With the readership in decline, both ad and subscrip-
tion revenue spiraled downward, and the splintered nature of the com-
petition made coordinated response impossible. Newspapers are also 
hampered by their physical distribution model: News is old before read-
ers even receive their papers, petroleum-intensive physical distribution is 
expensive, and from an ecological perspective, newsprint is anything but 
green. Indeed, U.S. newsprint consumption fell by 50% between 2001 and 
2009.3 Because this ﬁ gure is greater than the rate of subscriber loss, papers 
were getting smaller as well, indicating a steep decline in ad revenue.
In addition, the culture of “free” has affected news nearly as much as 
music, but far less so than books, for example. Some observers, including 
The Economist, have speculated that a Kindle or other reader might play a 
part in a revitalized news distribution business model. This makes sense: 
Books, newspapers, and magazines emerged as business opportunities 
following a technology disruption, so changing the technology implies 
change for both reading habits and business building.
Indeed, 2010 proved to be the year of the tablet following the rapid 
consumer adoption of the iPad. Large content companies such as Condé 
Nast, News Corporation, and Time Warner ﬂ ocked to tablets, hoping 
to establish an early consumer pattern in which paying for news was a 
conditioned behavior. Before the device was released, industry insiders, 
hoping for such a state of affairs, called the iPad “the Jesus tablet.”4 Now 
that the category appears to be thriving, however, pricing, ergonomics, 
archives, the balance of still to video layouts, and many other aspects of 
the newspaper model remain works in progress, and no clear answer has 
yet emerged, proﬁ table or not.
Looking Ahead
In parallel with the decline in newspaper readership, the advertising indus-
try has been fundamentally challenged by targeted, interactive, and well-
instrumented ads and all they imply. If tablets and other e-readers do 
reinvigorate the news business, this sector will need to move sure-footedly 
in parallel with the editorial business to regain much of the ground it has 
lost to Google in the past few years. In addition, while the movement away 
from traditional print models is highly visible, YouTube and the phenome-
nal rise of Internet video will also force a reshaping of television’s econom-
ics. The ability of citizens armed with cameraphones to “report” on local 
events, as on CNN’s iReports, further complicates the news business.

News
What If Digital News Is Inherently Unproﬁ table?
On the day that the Chicago Tribune broke the story of Illinois 
Governor Rod Blagojevich’s arrest for allegedly peddling Barack 
Obama’s Senate seat, the paper’s parent company declared bank-
ruptcy. The timing told a powerful story. In a time and in a world 
with so much up for grabs and such a pressing need for informed 
citizenries, the demise of the daily newsprint-driven business model 
raises critically important questions about accountability, about 
investment, and about the role of advertising.
Losing a newspaper is different from losing a travel agent or 
record store. Democracy is premised on public accountability, and 
a free, active press supports that objective, particularly through 
investigative journalism. A variety of efforts are under way to rede-
ﬁ ne newspaper reporting as a civic trust, potentially supported with 
foundation grants, National Public Radio-type donations, or a hybrid 
model. As Paul Starr put it,
If newspapers are no longer able to cross-subsidize public- 
service journalism and if the decentralized, non-market 
forms of collaboration [such as Wikipedia] cannot provide 
an adequate substitute, how is that work going to be paid for? 
The answer, insofar as there is one, is that we are going to 
need much more philanthropic support for journalism than 
we have ever had in the United States.5
Yale’s David Swensen and Michael Schmidt made the same point 
in a New York Times editorial just weeks earlier:
[T]here is an option that might not only save newspapers 
but also make them stronger: Turn them into nonproﬁ t, 
endowed 
institutions—like 
colleges 
and 
universities. 
Endowments would enhance newspapers’ autonomy while 
shielding them from the economic forces that are now tear-
ing them down.6
How big an endowment? A budget the size of the New York 
Times would cost $5 billion to endow. That’s Warren Buffett/Bill 
Gates territory, unless Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg were to step up.

CHAPTER 20
Healthcare
The solution seems obvious: to get all the information about patients out 
of paper ﬁ les and into electronic databases that . . .   can connect to one 
another so that any doctor can access all the information that he needs 
to help any given patient at any time in any place.
—“Special Report: IT in the Health-Care Industry,” 
The Economist, April 30, 2005
There’s no question that U.S. medicine is approaching a crisis. Depending on who’s 
counting, tens of millions of Americans carry no health insurance. Between 44,000 
and 98,000 people are estimated to die every year from preventable medical errors 
such as drug interactions; the fact that the statistics are so vague testiﬁ es to the 
problem.  The United States leads the world in healthcare spending per capita by a 
large margin ($7,500 versus about $5,000 for the runners-up: Norway, Canada, and 
Switzerland), but U.S. life expectancy ranks twenty-seventh, near that of Cuba, which 
is reported to spend about 1/25th as much per capita. Information technology (IT) has 
made industries such as package delivery, retail, and mutual funds more efﬁ cient; can 
healthcare beneﬁ t from similar gains?
Any assessment of the impact of information and communications tech-
nologies on the U.S. healthcare system must consider their effects 
on the multiple business models already in place. Unlike, say, Napster and 
the music industry or even the multithreaded issues of news, publishing 
companies, and the Internet, U.S. healthcare is so incredibly vast, with 
dozens if not hundreds of business models, that there is no single “it” to 
be disrupted.

Healthcare
The farther one looks into this issue, the more tangled the ques-
tions get. Let me assert at the outset that I believe electronic medical 
records are a good idea. But for reasons outlined later, IT by itself falls 
far short of meeting the challenge of rethinking health and healthcare. At 
the same time, those invested in the status quo should probably not get 
too comfortable, given some weak signals in the area of social media in 
particular.
Deﬁ nitions
What does the healthcare system purport to deliver? If longevity is the 
answer, clearly much less money could be spent to bring U.S. life expec-
tancy closer to Australia, where people live an average of three years 
longer with per capita expenditures 57% lower than in the United States 
But health means more than years: the phrase “quality of life” hints at the 
notion that we seek something nonquantiﬁ able from doctors, therapists, 
nutritionists, and others. At a macro level, no one can assess how well a 
healthcare system works because the metrics lack explanatory power: We 
know, only roughly, how much money goes in to a hospital, health main-
tenance organization (HMO), or even economic sector, but we don’t know 
much about the outputs.
Thinking of life expectancy, Americans at large don’t seem to view 
death as natural, even though it’s one of the very few things that happens 
to absolutely everyone. Within many outposts of the healthcare system, 
death is regarded as a failure of technology, to the point where central 
lines, respirators, and other interventions are applied to people who are 
naturally coming to the end of life. This approach of course incurs astro-
nomical costs, but it is a predictable outcome of a heavily technology-
driven approach to care.
At the other end of the spectrum, should healthcare make us even “bet-
ter than well?” As the bioethicist Carl Elliott compellingly argues in his book 
of that name,1 a substantial part of our investment in medicine, nutrition, 
and surgery is enhancement beyond what’s naturally possible. Cosmetic 
surgery, steroids, implants, and blood doping are no longer the exclusive 
province of celebrities and world-class athletes. Not only can we not deﬁ ne 
health on its lower baseline, it’s getting more and more difﬁ cult to know 
where it stops on the top bound as well.
If health is partially deﬁ ned by what people ingest, why stop with 
vitamins and supplements? What about the less healthy inputs that can be 
named as contributors to pulmonary conditions, obesity, or mouth can-
cers? That is, do both negative and positive contributors to people’s well-
being get included in the accounting? Are cigarette sales factored into

the healthcare accounting? As a result of the deﬁ nitional issues inherent 
in the subject matter and the massive scale of the enterprise, trying to 
name the U.S. healthcare “system” invites conceptual misery.
Healthcare as Car Repair for People?
Speaking in gross generalizations, U.S. hospitals are not run to deliver 
health; they are better described as sickness-remediation facilities. The 
ambiguous position of women who deliver babies demonstrates the pri-
mary orientation. Many of the institutional interventions and signals 
(calling the woman a “patient,” for example) are shared with the sickness-
remediation side of the house even though birth is not morbid under most 
circumstances. Some hospitals are turning this contradiction into a market-
ing opportunity: Plushly appointed “birthing centers” have the stated aim 
of making the new mom a satisﬁ ed customer. “I had such a good experi-
ence having Max and Ashley at XYZ Medical Center,” the intended logic 
goes, “that I want to go there for Dad’s heart problems.”
Understanding healthcare as sickness remediation has several corol-
laries. Doctors are deeply protective of their hard-won cultural author-
ity, which they guard with language, apparel, and other mechanisms, but 
the parallels between a hospital and a car repair garage run deep. After 
Descartes philosophically split the mind from the body in the 17th century, 
medicine followed the ontology of science to divide ﬁ elds of inquiry—and 
presumably repair—into discrete units.
At teaching hospitals especially, patients frequently report feeling less 
like a person and more like a sum of subsystems. Rashes are for derma-
tology, heart blockages set off a tug-of-war between surgeons and car-
diologists, joint pain is orthopedics or maybe endocrinology. Root-cause 
analysis frequently falls to secondary priority as the patient is reduced to 
his or her compartmentalized complaints and metrics. Pain is no service’s 
specialty but many patients’ primary concern. Systems integration between 
the subspecialties often falls to ﬂ oor nurses and the patient’s advocate if 
he or she can ﬁ nd one. The situation might be different if one is fortunate 
enough to have access to a hospitalist: a new specialty that addresses the 
state of being hospitalized, which the numbers show to be more deadly 
than car crashes.
The division of the patient into subsystems that map to professional 
ﬁ elds has many consequences. Attention focuses on the disease state 
rather than the path that led to that juncture: Preventive care lags far 
behind crisis management in glamour, funding, and attention. Diabetes 
provides a current example. Drug companies have focused large sums 
of money on insulin therapies, a treatment program that can change

millions of people’s lives, and more recently on obesity drugs. But when 
public health authorities try to warn against obesity as a preventive 
attack on diabetes, soft-drink and other lobbies immediately spring into 
action.
Finally, western medicine’s claim to be evidence based contradicts 
the lack of deﬁ nitive evidence for ultimate consequences. The practice 
of performing autopsies in cases of death where the cause is unclear 
has dropped steadily and steeply (from 19% of all U.S. deaths in 1972 
to 8% in 2003), to the point where doctors and families do not know 
what killed a sizable population of patients. A study at the University 
of Michigan estimated that almost 50% of hospital patients died of a 
condition for which they were not receiving treatment.2 It’s potentially 
the same situation as storeowner John Wanamaker bemoaning that half 
of his advertising budget was being wasted, but not knowing which 
half.
Following the Money
Healthcare costs money, involves scarcities and surplus, and employs 
 millions of people. As such, it constitutes a market—but one that fails to 
run under conventional market mechanisms. (For example, excess inven-
tory, in the form of unbooked surgical times, let’s say, is neither auctioned 
to the highest bidder nor put on sale to clear the market.) The parties that 
pay the most are rarely the parties whose health is being treated; the par-
ties that deliver care lack detailed cost data and therefore price services 
only in the loosest sense; and the alignment of patient preference with 
some notion of greater social good through the lens of for-proﬁ t insurers 
has many repercussions.
Consider a few market-driven suboptimizations:
 
 Chief executives at HMOs are rewarded for cost cutting, which often 
translates to cuts in hospital reimbursement. Hospitals, meanwhile, are 
frequently not-for-proﬁ t institutions, many of which have been forced 
to close their doors in the past two decades.
 
 Arrangements to pay for certain kinds of care for the uninsured intro-
duce further costs, and further kinds of costs, into an already complex 
set of ﬁ nancial ﬂ ows.
 
 As the British social researcher Richard Titmuss showed more than 
30 years ago in The Gift Relationship,3 markets don’t make sense for 
certain kinds of social goods. In his study, paying for blood donation 
lowered the amount and quality of blood available for transfusion; 
more recently, similar paradoxes and ethical issues have arisen regard-
ing tissue and organ donation.

Following the Money 
213
 
 Insurers prefer to pay for tangible rather than intangible services. 
Hospitals respond by building labs and imaging centers as opposed 
to mental health facilities, because services like psychiatric nursing are 
rarely covered.
 
 Once they build labs, hospitals want them utilized, so there’s further 
pressure (in addition to litigation-induced defensiveness) for techno-
logical evidence gathering rather than time-consuming medical art such 
as history taking and palpation, for which doctors are not reimbursed.
 
 Many medical schools can no longer afford for their professors to do 
nonreimbursable things such as teach or serve on national standards 
bodies. The doctors need to bring in grant money to fund research 
and insurance money for their clinical time. Teaching can be highly 
uneconomical for all concerned. One reason there is a shortage of 
nurses, meanwhile, is that there is a shortage of nursing professors.
 
 As a result, conditions with clear diagnoses (such as fractures) are 
treated more favorably in economic terms, and therefore in inter-
ventional terms, than conditions that lack “hard” diagnostics (such as 
allergies or neck pain). Once again, the vast number of people with 
mental health issues are grossly underserved.
If the trend does not reverse soon, healthcare expenditures are pro-
jected to double as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) in only 
25 years, according to the Congressional Budget Ofﬁ ce. (See Figure 20.1.)4

Healthcare
Where Information Technology Can and Cannot Help
IT has made signiﬁ cant improvements possible in business settings 
with well-deﬁ ned, repeatable processes, such as originating a loan or 
ﬁ lling an order. Medicine involves some processes that ﬁ t this descrip-
tion, but it also involves a lot of impossible-to-predict scheduling, 
healing as art rather than science, and institutionalized barriers to 
communication.
IT is currently used in four broad medical areas:
 1. Billing and ﬁ nance
 2. Supply chain and logistics
 3. Imaging and instrumentation
 4. Patient care
Patient registration is an obvious example of the ﬁ rst; waiting rooms 
and foodservice the second; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appoint-
ments, blood tests, and bedside monitoring the third; and physician order 
entry, patient care notes, and prescription writing the fourth. Each type 
of automation introduces changes in work habits, incentives, and costs to 
various parties in the equation.
Information regarding health and information regarding money often 
follow parallel paths: If I get stitched up after falling on my chin, the insur-
ance company is billed for an emergency department visit and a suture 
kit at the same time that the hospital logs my visit—and, I hope, ﬂ ags any 
known antibiotic allergies. Meanwhile the interests and incentives are fre-
quently anything but parallel: I might want a plastic surgeon to suture my 
face; the insurer prefers a physician’s assistant. From the patient’s perspec-
tive, having systems that more seamlessly interoperate with the HMO may 
not be positive if that results in fewer choices or a perceived reduction 
in the quality of care. On the provider side, the hospital and the plastic 
surgeon will send separate bills, each hoping for payment but neither 
coordinating with the other. Bills frequently appear in a matter of days, 
with every issuer hoping to get paid ﬁ rst, before the patient realizes any 
potential errors in calculating copay or deductible. The amount of time and 
money spent on administering the current dysfunctional multipayer sys-
tem is difﬁ cult to conceive: One credible estimate suggested 21% of excess 
spending, or $150 billion in 2008, came from administrative costs.5
Privacy issues are nontrivial. Given that large-scale breaches of per-
sonal information are almost daily news in 2011,6 what assurance will 
patients have that a complex medical system will do a better job shield-
ing privacy than Citigroup or LexisNexis? With genomic predictors of

215
health—and of potential costs for insurance coverage—around the corner, 
how will patients’ and insurers’ claims on that information be reconciled?
Currently a number of services let individuals combine personal 
control and portability of their records. It’s easy to see how such an 
approach may not scale: Something as trivial as password resets in cor-
porate computing environments already involve sizable costs. In light 
of that complexity, think about managing the sum of past and present 
patients and employees as a user base with access to the most sensitive 
information imaginable. With portable devices proliferating, the many 
potential paths of entry multiply both the security perimeter and the cost 
of securing it.
Hospitals already tend to treat privacy as an inconvenience— witness 
the universal use of the ridiculous johnnie gowns, which do more to 
demean the patient than to improve quality of care. The medical record 
doesn’t even belong to the person whose condition it documents. 
American data privacy standards, even after the enactment of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), lag behind 
those in the European Union. From such a primitive baseline, getting to a 
new state of shared accountability, access, and privacy will take far more 
diplomacy than systems development.
Spending on diagnostic technology currently outpaces patient care IT. 
Hospitals routinely advertise less conﬁ ning MRI machines, digital mam-
mography, and 3D echocardiography; it’s less easy to impress constituen-
cies with effective metadata for patient care notes, for example. (Some 
computerized record systems merely capture images of handwritten forms 
with only minimal indexing.) After these usually expensive machines 
produce their intended results, the process by which diagnosticians and 
ultimately caregivers use those results is often haphazard: Many tests are 
never consulted or compared to previous results—particularly if they were 
generated somewhere else. NIH doesn’t just stand for National Institutes of 
Health; not invented here is also alive and well in hospitals.
Back in the early days of business reengineering, when technology 
and process change were envisioned as a potent one-two punch in the 
gut of inefﬁ ciency, the phrase “Don’t pave the cowpaths” was frequently 
used as shorthand. Given that medicine can be routinized only to a cer-
tain degree, and given that many structural elements contribute to the 
current state of affairs, it’s useful to recall the old mantra. Without new 
ways of organizing the vastness of a longitudinal medical record, for 
example, physicians could easily ﬁ nd themselves buried in a haystack 
of records, searching for a needle without a magnet. Merely automating 
a bad process rarely solves any problems, and usually creates big new 
ones.

Healthcare
Change comes slowly to medicine, and the application of technol-
ogy depends, here as always, on the incentives for different parties to 
adopt new ways of doing things. Computerized approaches to care-
giving include expert knowledge bases, automated lockouts much like 
those in commercial aviation, and medical simulators for training stu-
dents and experienced practitioners alike. Each of these methods has 
proven beneﬁ ts but only limited deployment. Further beneﬁ ts could 
come from well care and preventive medicine, but these areas have 
proven less amenable to the current style of IT intensiﬁ cation. Until 
the reform efforts such as the Leapfrog initiative to mobilize employer 
health insurance purchasing power can address the culture, process, and 
incentive issues in patient care, the increase in clinical IT investment 
will do little to drive breakthrough change in the length and quality of 
Americans’ lives.
Disruptive Innovation
Apart from clinical IT, however, several potential disruptions appear to 
be taking shape. Brief descriptions of some of these are accompanied by 
potential winners and losers.
Channel Innovation
Recall that healthcare IT focused on four areas: billing and ﬁ nance, sup-
ply chain and logistics, imaging and instrumentation, and patient care. If 
“patient care” is rephrased as “customer service,” it’s clear that companies 
already good at some of these processes might have potential in some 
aspect of medicine. As it turns out, such retailers as Wal-Mart, CVS, and 
Walgreens are putting clinics in selected stores to address routine matters 
that would often otherwise require an emergency department visit.7
Potential winners: Patients get the right level of care with extreme 
convenience. Payors get excellent performance for money, if the visit 
is reimbursed at all, since proﬁ table economics are engineered into the 
self-selecting population. Retailers give customers more reason to visit. 
Emergency rooms should beneﬁ t by having the private market triage some 
low-intensity patients out of the system.
Potential losers: Hard to see any, apart from physician prestige.
Telemedicine
Particularly in the developing world, where doctors and clinics cannot 
meet the need in many countries, mobile phones are connecting people

217
to medical resources in new ways. Real-time diagnostic indicators can be 
easily transmitted by, and often read on, mobile devices. Cameras can 
be used as sensors, so the mobile phone becomes a rudimentary blood 
lab. Text-message reminders to take necessary medication are increasing 
compliance and improving outcomes. Geolocation can help identify safe 
water, malarial ponds, and other public health resources. The list goes on, 
but many of these techniques will migrate from Asia and Africa to North 
America and Europe in a fascinating pattern of “reverse” globalization.
Potential winners: Citizens, entrepreneurs.
Potential losers: Hard to see any downside, but traditional modes of 
cure might see decline in prestige.
Online Communities
Imagine living alone, in a big city or a rural town, and having a serious 
condition, such as multiple sclerosis. Even with insurance, physician and 
nurse visits can only provide so many answers. What will be the sequence 
of the disease? How do I choose a good wheelchair? What are the side 
effects of a given treatment regimen? Web sites such as www.patients
likeme.com have emerged to accumulate and deliver real-world advice 
and support to many disease communities.8
An important advantage of peer communities over therapeutic pro-
viders is in compliance and motivation. In weight loss, for example, hav-
ing a doctor say “lose 15 pounds” does little in the way of motivation. 
Finding a community, perhaps one with a shared or individual goal, can 
make a huge difference. Individually, such behavioral motivators as stickk.
com use the academic insight that small symbolic wagers and similar tech-
niques can be highly effective in changing people’s patterns. At the group 
level, the team of Northwestern University alums at workplaces in Chicago 
will work harder to lose their collective 500 pounds if a charitable dona-
tion to the United Way and bragging rights over the Illinois alumni are 
at stake.
Potential winners: Anyone who has felt isolated while in ill health.
Potential losers: It’s hard to call this disruptive, in that most physi-
cians won’t claim to be effective motivators, but online communities do 
have the potential to diminish the doctor’s cultural authority when shared 
research and motivated interest lead the group to start recommending 
diagnostic or treatment protocols.
Rethinking Devices
A typical ultrasound machine for sale in the United States typically costs in 
the range of $100,000 and is approximately the size of a washing machine.

Healthcare
Portable units closer to the dimensions of a laptop PC have been in vari-
ous stages of development for roughly a decade and are starting to gain 
market traction. From the standpoint of an incumbent—GE or Siemens, 
for example—the new models are not a threat insofar as radiologists at 
major medical centers would not be satisﬁ ed with the limited ﬂ exibility 
and image quality of the portables, so these companies are in fact “dis-
rupting themselves” with certain models.
But the innovation goes beyond engineering and marketing at 
device manufacturers. What are the implications for the business pro-
cesses that the technology supports? New kinds of technicians, and 
training, and treatment protocols are necessary to wrap around the tech-
nology. Rather than potentially disrupting nonexistent radiologists in the 
developing world, the technology has the potential to create whole new 
“lines of business” compared to stethoscopes or other health technology 
alternatives.
Portable ultrasound has also been implicated in more than 100 million 
missing women in Asia: Because of various cultural concerns, girl babies 
are less desired than boys. Ultrasound imaging can give prospective par-
ents advance notice of a fetus’s sex, and gender-driven abortion is com-
mon even while illegal. While technologists cannot tell parents the sex, 
the ultrasound report is sometimes delivered in a pink or blue envelope, 
and the parents can act on the winked information.9
Potential winners: Hardware manufacturers, wireless carriers, patients.
Potential losers: Patient privacy could become an issue.
Checklists
Surprisingly, the simple checklist is a radical idea in healthcare and in 
practice is anything but simple. Much like aviation, where the concept 
originated, many healthcare procedures are complex, life critical, and 
prone to simple human error: the wrong side of the body is operated on, 
sponges are left inside the body, bandages and intravenous lines are not 
changed at the right intervals. Harvard surgeon Atul Gawande has been a 
leader in a worldwide effort to introduce checklists into surgery, with dra-
matic results.10
The idea of a checklist introduces multiple issues. Surgeons are 
known to be skilled and expected to be in charge of the proceedings, 
but anything as complex as surgery is a team event, and surprisingly 
little time is spent on improving team performance: Even the simple 
act of having the team members introduce themselves by name was 
found to make a difference. Much like business process steps that peo-
ple are less inclined to perform sloppily if they hand off to a known

associate as opposed to an anonymous “other,” surgery goes better if 
the person behind the mask is a person with a name. Similarly, giving 
nurses the authority, and the responsibility, to stop a procedure if a 
critical step, such as the preoperative administration of antibiotic, is not 
followed shifts responsibility from the artisanal surgeon to the entire 
team.
Checklist formulation, however, is hard to do well. Put in too many 
steps, and they get skimmed or the list is disregarded. Fail to spell out, in 
the fewest words possible, every task, and debates begin about the intent. 
Include only the essentials, be they trivial or monumental, and checklists 
save lives: When Captain Chesley Sullenberger and his crew successfully 
ditched his USAirways A320 in the Hudson River in 2009, they were fol-
lowing checklists, not acting out heroic improvisations. Another aviation 
checklist includes the imperative “Fly the airplane:” Restarting an engine 
can become so engrossing that pilots have neglected other higher priori-
ties, such as watching out the window.
While checklists disrupt few business models, they are improving per-
formance, changing authority relationships, and forcing hospital admin-
istrators and doctors themselves to revisit their assumptions about the 
origins of improved patient outcomes. As Gawande writes:
[I]f someone discovered a new drug that could cut down sur-
gical complications with anything remotely like the effective-
ness of the checklist, we would have television ads with minor 
celebrities extolling its virtues. . . .   Government programs would 
research it. Competitors would jump in to make better and better 
versions.11
Looking Ahead
With so any moving parts, healthcare delivery and reimbursement in the 
United States is impossible to characterize except in the broadest pos-
sible terms. There will be no Napster, it is safe to say, no Skype, and 
no Facebook that will dominate. At the same time, changing mores about 
participation, about cultural differences (in both attitudes and genomes), 
and about cost and transparency are driving change. The current trajectory 
is unsustainable, the baby boom generation is entering its most expensive 
phase of healthcare life, and the numbers prove emphatically that the cur-
rent model is broken. Fixing little corners, often quietly, will be the norm, 
and like a path of footsteps in the sand, we most likely will have to look 
back to ﬁ gure out when we changed direction.

CHAPTER 21
Two Disruptions that Weren’t
Two large, consumer-facing sectors have had their ups and downs over the past 
decade, but heretofore neither has been “disrupted” in the way that Linux, Skype, and 
Google News dismantled existing industries.
Retail
Despite its unquestioned status as an innovator and a leader in customer 
experience, Amazon historically hasn’t been credited with business 
model disruption on the scale of Napster, Skype, or online brokerages 
like E*TRADE: That situation may change. While major retailers, includ-
ing Target and Wal-Mart, appear to be weathering the current economy 
reasonably well, and many stores may be in for a wave of changes, to 
date retail looks a lot like it did 20 years ago.
Four overlapping forces appear to be at work to change retail, two of 
them moving extremely rapidly: economics, demographics, mobility, and 
social media. Taken together, these powerful waves of change are creating 
new opportunities, threats, and leaders in a well-established industry.
Economics
Consumers have less money to spend, particularly on discretionary pur-
chases. Three main drivers come into play here.
MORTGAGE EQUITY From 2000 until 2008, Americans withdrew more than 
$40 billion of mortgage equity per quarter, riding an updraft in housing 
prices to turn that change in market value into vacations, cars, or kitchen 
renovations.1 Now equity is increasing: People are investing more in their

mortgages than they are pulling out. Foreclosures certainly skew this num-
ber, but the bottom line is that consumers are not converting mortgage 
equity into consumption at nearly the same rate as earlier.
Perhaps the most visible symbol of the transition is the change in 
the upscale home decor market: Home Depot’s 34 Expo Design Centers 
closed in 2009. Interestingly, two years later, its Web site was still up. 
A sampling of the text illustrates the transition from the heyday of reno-
vations, a long way from current days when dollar store and McDonald’s 
stocks top the leaderboard:
EXPO Design Center offers homeowners professional design and 
installation services, and carries the most luxurious and innova-
tive products picked from around the world.
Each of EXPO’s 10 showrooms features unique lifestyle 
vignettes so that customers can walk from one to the other, visualiz-
ing full-room scenes while pulling all of the elements of an interior 
design project together.
Despite record low mortgage rates in 2011, home renting is grow-
ing while both new and existing home sales remain slow. The thought 
of investing in new kitchens and bathrooms for resale purposes feels out of 
tune with the austerity and reality of the times. That a cost-no-object home 
improvement palace could be viable only 10 years ago illustrates how fast 
and how far the pendulum has swung.
WAGES AND UNEMPLOYMENT In addition to the shutoff of mortgage equity 
cash withdrawals, unemployment remains high: By Gallup’s poll numbers, 
fully one-ﬁ fth of the workforce is either without work or working part 
time when full time would be desired.2 For the employed, meanwhile, 
wage pressure is high: According to Labor Department statistics, year-
over-year wage and beneﬁ t growth has been slowing for at least the last 
decade. On average, a worker can expect to see his or her pay packet 
increase only about 1% to 2% a year. To take a slice of the population I 
see every day, 40% of Americans in their 20s move back in with parents, 
in part because expenses are high and job prospects are limited. For their 
part, the parents themselves may need help making the mortgage.
PRICE PRESSURE Oil prices surged since the wave of democracy move-
ments spread across the Arab oil states. Food prices will head up because 
oil supplies fertilizer feedstocks and powers tractors but also because of 
short-, medium-, and long-term factors: climatic conditions (Russian wild-
ﬁ res, Chinese drought, Mexican freezes), competition for crops from etha-
nol production, and increased meat in the diets of the developing world.

Retail 
223
When a family spends more for food and fuel and most likely doesn’t see 
big raises (if they’re not in the 20% of the underemployed workforce), dis-
cretionary purchases will have to shrink.
Demographics
As smartphones become more and more prevalent, distinctions based 
on the separation of physical retail from cybershopping are quickly dis-
appearing. Signiﬁ cantly, the social couponing startup Groupon says its 
customers’ usage overlaps heavily with smartphones: 68% of users (as 
of 2010) were 18 to 34 years of age, and 49% were single. Following the 
Groupon direction, 67% of smartphone users under 35 use smartphones 
while shopping, according to the research ﬁ rm Chadwick Martin Bailey.3 
As fast as U.S. consumers are buying smartphones, however, they lag 
southern Europe. According to year-end 2010 ﬁ gures from the researchers 
at comScore, U.S. smartphone penetration moved 50% in a year, from 17% at 
the end of 2009 to 27% a year later. Spain, meanwhile, leads all countries 
at 38% smartphone market share. Italy is growing more slowly but still 
ranks second to Spain at 35%.
It shouldn’t be a surprise that women are more social than men, but 
online, they are clearly in the ascendancy.4 Consider what these sites all 
share in common: Women drive 62% of Facebook activity. Sixty percent 
of Zynga gamers (FarmVille et al.) are women. Seventy-seven percent of 
Groupon users are women. Women follow more people and post far more 
than men at Twitter. Women are notably more active than men at dining-
related sites, including Yelp and Opentable. Why does this matter? Women 
control 80% of consumer spending in the United States.
Mobility
Once people go mobile, what do they do? Among smartphone users in 
the United States, the overwhelming leader in shopping tasks is price 
comparison. eBay bought the Red Laser start-up in 2010 and quickly 
rolled out its capability to turn a smartphone into a barcode scanner and 
compare the Universal Product Code (UPC) of the physical good in the 
store to prices across virtual merchants. The speed and power of the ser-
vices are most impressive. Nine million downloads were reported as of 
early 2011, and eBay has licensed the technology to more than 150 ﬁ rms, 
including Coupons.com and Shopkick (about which, more in a moment). 
Amazon offers the same functionality. Some retailers are defeating the bar 
codes on their own merchandise (black permanent markers are quick and 
effective, while some chains historically have pasted proprietary bar codes 
over the UPC) to prevent in-store price comparison.

224 
Two Disruptions that Weren’t
The logic of these merchants is easy to understand. Amazon has mas-
sive buying power, enjoys a ~6% structural price advantage because of its 
sharply limited exposure to state sales tax, and has built a powerful lens 
into various product categories with its afﬁ liate sellers: Shop for a camera, 
and J&R or Adorama will likely be featured on the page, while in ath-
letic shoes, Road Runner Sports might show up. Through these and other 
means, Amazon knows and likely often makes the market for a given 
item.
Apart from these shopping-speciﬁ c applications, the power of the 
smartphone platform as a general-purpose computing platform is being 
explored at a stunningly rapid pace. As mobility becomes more powerful 
and more ﬂ exible, retailers will continue to be pressed to match the inno-
vations of the smartphone. The Apple App Store, operating since 2008, 
has a section of about 500,000 titles; the Android platform is growing 
faster and has about as many apps, if not as much revenue.
Having access to such power while in motion has the effect of low-
ering coordination costs. Services that not long ago required a  formal 
organization can be accomplished on a people-to-people basis. Airbnb 
(an air mattress in your spare room turns you into a bed-and- breakfast, 
hence the name) has booked a million room nights and now has 
launched a mobile app, for example. Square, a potentially disruptive 
credit card reader attachment for smartphones, allows anyone to become 
a merchant. Kiva has loaned more than $200 million to more than 
500,000 entrepreneurs in just over ﬁ ve years. Zipcar operates a short-term 
car rental service that would be impossible without distributed wireless 
technology. Each of these innovations holds challenges and lessons for 
physical retailers.
For example, access to smartphones changes game play. Check-in 
games such as Foursquare and Facebook Places allow patrons to become 
“mayors” of businesses they frequent,or connect to other facets of identity. 
Shopkick, a two-year-old start-up, gives shoppers reward points simply for 
checking into a retail location. The service employs a proprietary radio 
technology that both works indoors and is more accurate than GPS. Best 
Buy and Sports Authority are both customers.
More recently, two-dimensional bar codes (see Figure 21.1) allow the 
retailer to leverage the mobile platform to raise customer service capa-
bilities, manage promotions, and otherwise use the same smartphone to 
help turn the tide of price comparison and the concomitant commoditiza-
tion. Home Depot launched a program using bar codes to drive in-store 
purchase behavior, in part through the kind of detailed product informa-
tion and person-to-person reviews familiar to anyone who has shopped 
online. Macy’s and Best Buy are also experimenting with the technology 
in selected markets.

225
Social Media
Shopkick is also signiﬁ cant in that it marries location/mobility with social 
media. Many users of Facebook and other networks are interested in 
social change, so Shopkick piloted with CauseApp, which was down-
loaded more than 500,000 times. It donated money to nonproﬁ ts based on 
a consumer checking into participating retailers. (SocialVibe offers similar 
functionality to such clients as Disney, GE, and Microsoft but not speciﬁ -
cally on mobile.)
Apart from social causes, shopping is an inherently social activ-
ity. Groupon is an obvious example: Deals are not merely broadcast 
but engineered to be shared by social networks. Blippy allowed mem-
bers to update each other on purchase behavior before shifting direction. 
LivingSocial began as a social sharing site (tell your friends what’s on your 
bookshelf) but later launched daily coupon deals.
Back in the retail domain, shopping is taking on a social dimen-
sion as it overlaps with gaming and entertainment. Calling it “shop-
pertainment” isn’t elegant, but the description ﬁ ts. While people have 
long passed on news of deals to their friends (coupon-sharing sites 
are more than a decade old), the trend toward merging entertainment 
and commerce can be clearly seen in the rapid rise of one-deal-at-a-
time (ODAT) sites. The granddaddy here is probably Amazon: The Gold 
Box was introduced in 2002 and has been expanded and reﬁ ned in the 
years since. More recently, woot! launched in 2005, offering one deal a 
day, with the new product available at midnight Dallas time. The social 
dimension is key: Contests, blogs, and user-generated content abound. 
Facebook refers signiﬁ cant trafﬁ c. Product descriptions are written in a 
mock-literary tone that can be equally grating, snarky, and humorous: 
The FAQ expressly states they are included for entertainment purposes.

Two Disruptions that Weren’t
The site then expanded from its core in electronics to include paral-
lel wine, home, T-shirt, and kids’ offerings. Amazon acquired the ﬁ rm 
in 2010.
In that same period, Gilt Groupe was getting serious publicity. The 
ODAT ﬁ rm, founded in 2007, specializes in luxury goods, available only 
to members for 36 hours. Annual revenues are in the $300 million range. 
Given the ﬁ rm’s New York ofﬁ ces and proximity to the fashion industry, 
media attention has been plentiful. The ﬁ rm’s leaders state that it is con-
templating an initial public offering in 2012.
Far from New York, another ODAT business has expanded. 
Backcountry.com is headquartered in Salt Lake City and carries roughly 
1,000 brands. Its family of sites sell bike, snowboard, ski, and out-
door gear, sometimes at aggressive discounts. As opposed to Amazon 
(which hosts Gold Box deals for a few hours), woot! (24 hours), or Gilt 
(36 hours), Backcountry’s steepandcheap site usually sells in 30-minute 
windows. Matching the inventory, the price, and the time is akin to tele-
vision programming: Much as local stations rely on late-night comedian 
David Letterman to bring viewers to their 11:00 P.M. newscasts, steepand-
cheap and its sister sites like Bonktown (for cycling gear) need people to 
sit on the site for more than one bargain.
Several tools help drive Backcountry’s success. First, social media and 
texting allow people to clue fellow enthusiasts in to new deals. Second, 
the site can send alerts to mobile devices, and smartphone owners can 
purchase from that platform. Finally, afﬁ liate sites, some of them aggrega-
tors, also help spread the word among deal hunters. Given that these are 
discretionary purchases, the game elements of the presentation help pro-
vide incentive: Counters convey the number of people on the site (for the 
Web site version, not the app), the current inventory levels, and the time 
remaining. Deals may show up multiple times per day; somewhat  fewer 
than 48 unique products are featured every 24 hours. But because of the 
randomness, an average of about 10,000 to 12,000 users can be watching 
the site during daylight hours.
The model clearly works. In one 30-minute segment, 168 Oakley 
sweatshirts came up at $16.99 each; 152 sold, for a net revenue of $2,582. 
In another block, 339 pairs of cold-weather boxer shorts sold at $14.00 
apiece; that netted $4,746. Averaging those random examples gives about 
$3,600 per half-hour, $7,200 per business hour, or perhaps $75,000 to 
$100,000 per 24-hour day. Guesstimating $500,000 per seven-day week 
would extrapolate to $25 million a year just for one site; others, devoted 
to bigger-ticket items including bicycles, would have different proﬁ les. All 
together, Backcountry.com is a $250 million business, according to the 
ﬁ rm’s Web site.

Adding It Up
Where is retail heading? Three overall trends appear to be mutually 
reinforcing:
 1. Physical and virtual shopping are becoming indistinguishable. 
Shoppers can touch and compare physical items at the same moment 
they are accessing extensive price comparisons, researching detailed 
descriptions of features and beneﬁ ts, and weighing word of mouth 
(either archived on review sites or real-time via Twitter).
 2. Retailing, particularly for discretionary purchases, must transcend 
price, selection, and service. Involvement, whether through game ele-
ments (including the in-store promotions made possible with smart-
phone bar-code readers), user-generated content (e.g., ski videos at 
Backcountry), clever ad copy, or other features, is becoming more 
important in some categories.
 3. Price and performance pressure will not relent. Groupon and 
LivingSocial are conditioning bargain hunters to expect 50% off as the 
baseline. Amazon’s volume purchasing, supply-chain excellence, and 
tax-advantaged status make it difﬁ cult to beat. At the same time, its 
sites load fast, its mobile apps are appealing, and surveys rank it at 
the top of on- or ofﬂ ine customer service polls. Regardless of prime 
real estate, customer goodwill, or previous isolation from competition, 
local retailers cannot avoid confronting the long reach of the Seattle 
superstore. In addition, Amazon never stands still, constantly innovat-
ing, acquiring, and reﬁ ning, making it a moving target for anyone else 
to benchmark, much less emulate.
Real Estate
It’s hard to believe that in the 15 years since the notion of Internet disin-
termediation ﬁ rst received widespread attention in Bill Gates’s book The 
Road Ahead, we’re still being surprised. If you look at travel agents who 
formerly collected a lot of money for printing airline tickets, for example, 
the prophecy has come true.
Residential real estate was another ﬁ eld predicted to be toast. John 
Baen and Randall S. Guttery predicted in 1997 that jobs would be lost to 
automation, commissions would drop, and more sellers could sell direct.5 
The logic of the argument is strong, even in hindsight, but it doesn’t hold 
up. Instead of being pushed aside by the Internet, real estate agents, indi-
vidually and in powerful trade associations, have been aggressive in their 
adoption of emerging technologies. Rather than being disintermediated,

Two Disruptions that Weren’t
the National Association of Realtors has become the subject of Federal 
Trade Commission and Department of Justice inquiries into price main-
tenance: U.S. house sellers generally pay a 6% commission while in the 
United Kingdom, the ﬁ gure is only 2%.
What happened that the prediction could be so far off?
The picture is not unambiguously successful. Real estate agents in the 
United States enjoyed a year of extremely high market activity in 2004, but 
average commission income went down, in part because average selling 
prices were accompanied by a drop in the average commission to 5.1% 
and in part because the barrier to entry for the ﬁ eld is low enough that 
lots of new aspiring agents got their licenses. Still, this increased interest 
largely means that the ﬁ eld was a victim of its own success. Six factors 
appear to have helped real estate brokers avoid disintermediation:
 1. Real estate is a relationship business. Whether an individual is hunting 
for scarce properties in a hot market or scarce buyers in a cool one, 
good real estate agents embed themselves in deep social networks. 
The trust required for buyers to make what is typically the biggest 
purchase of their lives does not translate to a browser-based form. 
In a tough market for house sellers, people often ﬁ nd their buyer 
through a real estate agent who had been working with her as a buy-
er’s broker. Could a Web site, however thorough, have emulated that 
trust if people try to sell the property themselves?
 2. Houses aren’t plane tickets. To the extent that house purchases are 
deeply personal and given that every buyer is different, the match-
ing of buyer to property requires both architectural and psychological 
understanding, patience, and some luck. Real estate agents spend a 
lot of time behind the scenes learning the market, tracking trends, and 
generally becoming informed as to what combinations of features will 
match up best with a given buyer.
 3. Control over information confers power. A real estate transaction 
involves multiple layers of information: comparable sales, future uses 
for nearby vacant land, whether the neighborhood kids are nice and 
the schools good, what kind of builder put up the structure, and so 
on. Little of this exists in standardized databases, and it’s both hard 
and expensive to generate in a channel outside traditional real estate 
ﬁ rms. Where data does exist in structured form, access both to add 
and to view important kinds of information is tightly controlled.
 4. Organization is power. The National Association of Realtors is large, 
well funded, and effective in inﬂ uencing legislation. Many attempts 
to create alternative business models, involving less than full ser-
vice but more than for-sale-by-owner behavior, have been literally 
c21.indd   228

229
or  effectively outlawed in certain states. No comparable organization 
exists for travel agents, for example.
 5. Real estate has embraced emerging technologies. I can recall seeing the 
iPix 3-D photographic demo at a trade show in the late 1990s; now ﬂ y-
throughs, often sophisticated, are a staple of real estate Web sites. Some 
brokers have taken to using blogs as another tool to build relationships, 
confer authority, and generally keep their names in play. Even so, the 
most powerful tool for most agents remains the mobile phone, a device 
and set of capabilities that the Web has a hard time replacing.
 6. Home buying is a complex transaction. As my former Penn State col-
league Steve Sawyer and his coauthors have found, it’s naive to speak 
of disintermediation, singular, in the process of purchasing a house or 
condominium. The Web has clearly changed the process, but there are 
too many moving parts in the transaction for it to be conducted com-
pletely on line. Some business-to-business aspects are moving toward 
standards like XML to smooth work ﬂ ows between, say, mortgage 
lenders and title insurers, but conceiving of the process as analogous 
to even car buying ignores the coordination and other roles played 
by a trusted party in a complicated, emotional, and large purchase. As 
Sawyer et al. state, “The analytic simplicity of categorizing complex 
transactions as either intermediated or not belies the web of connec-
tions and actions that make selling and buying real estate a multi-state 
and multi-step process.”6
It’s good counsel to observe as we analyze other predictions in the 
future.

Innovation in many domains is creating compound effects, given the 
shared platforms of PCs, smartphones, and the Internet. Looking brieﬂ y at 
a range of technologies as resources for innovation should help drive fur-
ther breakthroughs.

CHAPTER 22
Code
In any world, the current situation is not inevitable; “It might have been otherwise,” in 
the words of the American poet Jane Kenyon. Nowhere is this more true than in the 
world of computer code, which embeds past history, deeply buried assumptions and 
decisions, and future possibilities (or lack thereof). The ways in which the world is 
captured in code, and in which code is embedded in the world, are important to recog-
nize if not fully comprehend.
“Code” is a wonderful word, one with many interweaving meanings. 
As Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig brilliantly pointed out in his 
analysis of the Internet, the ﬁ rst meaning of the word relates to law and 
jurisprudence. Codes can also be systems of rules outside the law: a code 
of ethics. Most every child at some point gets fascinated with backward 
writing, letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, etc.), and other ways of transmitting 
secret messages: code as symbol, as in The Da Vinci Code. The genetic 
code is something else again. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, 
however, the relevant deﬁ nition for our purposes is straightforward: “Any 
system of symbols and rules for expressing information or instructions in 
a form usable by a computer or other machine for processing or transmit-
ting information.” Note how rules, representation, and a system are com-
mon to all meanings of the term.
It would be impossible to discuss all the changes wrought by 
our digital world without talking about code itself. Doing so, however, 
is extremely difﬁ cult, a bit like talking about the wind: We can readily 
see what it does (move leaves) but not what it is. A brief digression is 
necessary here. Code that makes things happen (moves characters in a 
game, performs operations in a spreadsheet, or turns on the car radio) is 
typically experienced as compiled code: One cannot see the potentially

Code
millions of operations behind the scenes while using FarmVille or Excel or 
a Volkswagen. (Decompiling the code is possible, and often done for the 
purpose of copying the program in violation of copyright, so decompil-
ers often operate in a legal gray area.) If one so desires, Linux and other 
examples of open-source software allow the owner/user of the software to 
see behind the curtain and to change the code before it runs in compiled 
form. Generally speaking, a small minority of people tweak code before 
runtime, but even they can’t reprogram their car’s antilock brakes or make 
the microwave oven sing “Happy Birthday.” Most code is hidden, expert 
user or no expert user.
Intangibility
This quality of intangibility is a central fact of our age: For every 100 
teenagers in 1961 who could understand and alter how a car ran by 
looking under the hood, only a handful of high schoolers today can 
modify a current video game or cell phone. Every car has a hood, an 
engine, spark plugs, wheels, a transmission, and the like. Physical laws 
govern the behavior of each component as well as the components’ 
interaction. Physical senses allow an individual to see, hear, touch, and 
smell a properly—or improperly—running automobile.1 Software, while 
exhibiting effects everywhere, remains hidden from the senses.
An exception helps prove the rule: From the early days of the World 
Wide Web, browsers included a control to reveal the page code, to show 
in a parallel window how the Web site was built.2 The language that 
deﬁ ned those pages was called Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML; it 
was lightweight and easy to learn. As the technical publisher Tim O’Reilly 
noted at the time, a generation of people learned to build Web sites by 
looking at how other people had built Web sites. HTML is a static lan-
guage that describes appearance: It deﬁ nes where page elements are 
placed, what colors appear, how big a font is, and the like. Nothing hap-
pens, unless you count crude animations. Meanings of and relationships 
between page elements are not speciﬁ ed.
For maps to slide with a mouse click, or videos to play, or payments 
to process, or Facebook to know friends from nonfriends, newer, more 
complex languages (and infrastructure such as databases, encryption, etc.) 
are required. With these, simple imitation will not sufﬁ ce: You must be a 
programmer of at least modest experience to understand the workings 
of a current-day Web page, although tools exist for nontechnical people 
to build powerful sites with drag-and-drop editing. These more powerful 
Web pages, considered as code, have considerable implications, as we will 
see presently.

Fungibility 
235
For the rest of us nonprogrammers, sensory appropriation does little 
or nothing to allow us to understand or manipulate code; no amount of 
baling wire or duct tape can ﬁ x a problem. For example, quantiﬁ cation 
has often been applied to programmer productivity metrics, as though 
mining coal or selling magazine subscriptions were similar to making 
computers work. “Lines of code written” proves to be a particularly bad 
way of judging programmer quality, as it turns out, but there are no easy 
yardsticks. Fred Brooks, a legend in the ﬁ eld of software engineering, 
writes of the “delight” the coder has in his materials:
The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from 
pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creat-
ing by exerting the imagination. Few media of creation are so ﬂ ex-
ible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing 
grand conceptual structures.3
Thus, as tempting as it is to equate code with the hardest of logic, 
with the unsurpassable lack of gray area implied by ones and zeros, there 
are ways in which code can best be understood as poetry, subject to the 
same loose laws of assessment, the same qualities of individual idiosyn-
cratic genius, the same problems of meaning.
Before we leave Brooks, he makes one other salient point. Whereas 
progress can be assessed visually with physical media, computer code 
is not done when the program is complete but rather when it is tested 
and debugged. Inexperienced project managers regularly make this mis-
take, thinking of building construction when it is a dangerously mislead-
ing metaphor. Because code is invisible and people’s sensory inputs do 
little to help them understand the extremely large numbers of potential 
interactions between subunits of a large system, testing and debugging 
are difﬁ cult tasks that require a particular discipline, sophisticated tools, 
and as much time as it takes to do the job—a quantity notably difﬁ cult to 
predict.
Fungibility
Testing and debugging also require the code to be done. For this to be 
accomplished, those building the system need to know what they are try-
ing to build, then freeze the requirements. “Freezing the requirements” 
means saying no to people who change their mind or have new infor-
mation. It also means stepping back from the essential malleability of 
code as well as the trait that allows it to do anything, its fungibility. These 
loops—of requirements, of design, of “just one more feature”—contribute

Code
to programs’ being late, even before the project team faces the ﬁ nal task, 
which is ﬁ nding errors, incompatibilities, and just plain mysteries that only 
appear at runtime.
Another fact of modern life separates us from the teenage mechanics 
of 50 years ago. Whereas an automobile engine, or a refrigerator compres-
sor, could not play music, or balance the checkbook, or identify one’s 
location, or conjure up Grandma’s face and voice from either the past or 
the present, today’s most basic digital devices can do any of these and all 
of these. That is, code is not only abstract and disembodied, it is ubiqui-
tous and increasingly fungible: A GPS location becomes a social media 
posting becomes a mash-up becomes a song becomes a video becomes a 
game move.
Code Embeds Value Judgments
Broadly speaking, computer code does one of two things: It instructs 
some piece of hardware to do something, or it records a value (the prod-
uct of having done something) for future recall and potentially manipula-
tion. In a loose analogy, the former type of code functions as verbs; the 
latter is essentially nouns. During the early stages of any software project, 
decisions are made that determine the rules of the road for how those 
nouns and verbs will work together. As Kevin Kelly, an astute commenta-
tor on matters technological, has pointed out, those default assumptions 
are rarely discussed at their moment of inception and yet persist, in some 
cases for decades, imposing their will on generations of both users and 
tenders of the system.4 The legal scholar Lawrence Lessig is more concise: 
“Code codiﬁ es values, and yet, oddly, most people speak of code as if it 
were just a question of engineering.”5 Once again, the meanings of the 
term overlap.
Can (a) a user, (b) a systems administrator, or (c) no one change the 
color or the logo of the home screen? How are languages built on non-
alphabetical elements, such as Arabic or Korean, rendered? In the credit 
crash of 2008, one credit-rating ﬁ rm had a risk model in which housing 
prices never went down: False optimism was literally engineered into the 
system. The lack of sensory inputs and of “user-servicable” parts makes 
these embedded assumptions all the more powerful insofar as they can-
not even be identiﬁ ed, much less adjusted. Furthermore, the large num-
ber of interacting variables makes isolating the relevant ones difﬁ cult 
or impossible: Systems debugging is a challenge for professionals who 
need to make the code run, and most people who want to understand 
what the code means ﬁ nd this barrier too steep to challenge with any 
regularity.

Metadata 
237
Metadata
As for the “noun” code, better known as data, we have more to say in 
the chapters on analytics (Chapter 29) and security (Chapter 7). From the 
perspective of pure code, data is important insofar as it is deﬁ ned by more 
data. The bits on a compact disc can play a song, for example, but the CD 
standard developed by Sony and Philips has no provision for the name 
of the song, or the artist, to be included on the disc. These facts, the data 
about the data, are called metadata and are phenomenally interesting in 
the age of extremely broad digitization and connectedness.
A digital photograph, for example, embeds information about the 
camera, the time and date, the lens, the exposure settings, and other 
optional information, such as GPS coordinates. Metadata becomes com-
plex and political when it is located in enterprise systems (when was this 
document created, when was the payment logged), and we will leave 
those aside for the moment.
In the era of Blogger, Facebook, and Flickr, the social web has broad-
reaching implications for personal data. In the early days, before comput-
ing, there was data, enumerating how many, what kind, where. Data was 
kept in proprietary formats and physically located: If the university library 
was missing the Statistical Abstract for 1940, or some other grad student 
had sequestered it, you had little chance to determine corn production 
in Nebraska before World War II. Even such statistics were the exception: 
Most data remained unpublished, in lab notebooks and elsewhere, or 
uncollected.
Once data migrated from print into bits, it became potentially ubiqui-
tous, and once formats became less proprietary, more people could gain 
access to more forms of data. The early history of the Web was built in 
part on a footing of public access to data: Online collections of maps, con-
gressional votes, stock prices, phone numbers, product catalogs, and other 
data proliferated.
Data has always required metadata: That table of corn production had 
a title and probably a methodological footnote. Such metadata typically 
was contributed by an expert in either the technical ﬁ eld or in the prac-
tice of categorizing. Ofﬁ cial taxonomies have continued the tradition of 
creators and curators having cognitive authority in the process of orga-
nizing. In addition, as Clay Shirky pointed out in his essay “Ontology Is 
Overrated,” the heritage of physicality led to the need for one answer 
being correct so that an asset could be found: A book about Russian and 
American agricultural policy during the 1930s had to live among books 
on Russian history, agricultural history, or U.S. history. It was arguably 
about any or all of those things, but someone (most likely at the Library of 
Congress) assigned it a catalog number that ﬁ nalized the discussion: The

Code
book in question was ofﬁ cially and forever “about” this more than it was 
about that.6
In the past decade, the so-called read-write web (based on code that 
assigns values and relationships to the items on the page rather than merely 
describing their layout) has allowed anyone to become both a content cre-
ator and a metadata creator. Sometimes these activities coincide, as when 
someone tags her own YouTube video. More often, creations are submit-
ted to a commons like YouTube or Flickr or Facebook, and the common-
ers (rather than a cognitive authority) determine what the contribution is 
“about” and if they “like” it. Rather than editors or peer reviewers judging 
an asset’s quality before publication, in more and more settings, the default 
process is publication then collaborative ﬁ ltering for deﬁ nition, quality, and 
meaning.7
Imagine a particular propane torch for sale on Amazon.com. So-called 
social metadata has been nurtured and collected for years on the site. If 
I appreciate the way the torch works for its intended use of brazing cop-
per pipe, I can submit a review with both a star rating and prose. Amazon 
quickly allowed for more social metadata as you the reader of my review 
can now rate my review, thus creating metadata about metadata.
Here is where the discussion gets complicated and extremely inter-
esting. Suppose I say in my review that I use the Flamethrower 1000 for 
crème brûlée even though the device is not rated (by whatever safety 
or sanitation authority) for kitchen use. The comments about my torch 
review can quickly become a foodie discussion thread: the best crème 
brûlée recipe, the best restaurants at which to order it, regional variations 
in the naming or preparation of crème brûlée, and so forth. Amazon’s 
moderators might truncate the discussion to the extent it’s not “about” the 
Flamethrower 1000 under review, but the urge to digress has long been 
exhibited and will forever be demonstrated elsewhere.
Social Metadata
Enter Facebook. The platform is in essence a gigantic metadata gener-
ation and distribution system. (“I liked the concert.” “The person who 
liked the concert did not know what she was talking about.” “My friend 
was at the concert and said it was uneven.” And so on.) Strip Facebook 
of attribute data and there is little left: It’s essentially a mass of descrip-
tors (including “complicated”), created by amateurs and never claimed as 
authoritative, linked by a twenty-ﬁ rst-century kinship network. Facebook’s 
adoption in 2010 of the Open Graph protocol institutionalizes this collec-
tion of conversations as one vast, logged, searchable metadata repository.

Social Metadata 
239
If I “like” something, my social network can be alerted, and the Web site 
object of my affection will know as well.
In late 2009, the security expert Bruce Schneier laid out ﬁ ve categories 
of social networking data:
 1. Service data. Service data is the data you need to give to a social net-
working site in order to use it. It might include your legal name, your 
age, and your credit card number. 
 2. Disclosed data. This is what you post on your own pages: blog 
entries, photographs, messages, comments, and so on. 
 3. Entrusted data. This is what you post on other people’s pages. It’s 
basically the same stuff as disclosed data, but the difference is that 
you don’t have control over the data—someone else does. 
 4. Incidental data. Incidental data is data the other people post about 
you. Again, it’s basically the same stuff as disclosed data, but the dif-
ference is that 1) you don’t have control over it, and 2) you didn’t cre-
ate it in the ﬁ rst place.
 5. Behavioral data. This is data that the site collects about your habits by 
recording what you do and who you do it with.8
What does Schneier’s list look like in the aftermath of Facebook’s 
decision in 2011 to use facial recognition to identify people in photo-
graphs as the default, without the individual’s permission? A user’s trail 
of “like” clicks makes this list, or her Netﬂ ix reviews and star ratings 
(themselves the subject of privacy concerns), seem like merely the tip of 
the iceberg. With anything so new and so massive in scale (50,000 sites 
adopted the “like” software tool kit in the ﬁ rst week), the unexpected con-
sequences will take years to accumulate. What will it mean when every 
opinion we express online, from the passionate to the petty, gets logged 
in the Great Preference Repository in the Sky, never to be erased and 
forever being able to be correlated, associated, regressed, and otherwise 
algorithmically parsed?
Several questions follow: Who will have either direct or indi-
rect access to the metadata conversation? What are the opt-in, opt-out, 
and monitoring/correction provisions? If I once mistakenly clicked a 
Budweiser “like” button but have since publicly declared myself a Molson 
man, can I see my preference library as if it’s a credit score and rem-
edy any errors or misrepresentations? What will be the rewards for brand 
monogamy versus the penalties for promiscuous “liking” of every product 
with a prize or a coupon attached?
While this technology appears to build barriers to competitive entry for 
Facebook, what happens if I establish a preference proﬁ le when I’m 14, 
c22.indd   239

Code
then decide I no longer like zoos, American Idol, or Gatorade? Will people 
seek a fresh start at some point in an undeﬁ ned network, with no prehis-
tory? What is the mechanism for “unliking” something, and how far retro-
spectively will it apply?
Precisely because Facebook is networked, we’ve come a very long 
way from that Statistical Abstract on the library shelf. What happens to 
my social metadata once it traverses my network? How much or how 
little control do I have over what my network associates (“friends” in 
Facebook-speak) do with my behavioral and opinion data that come their 
way? As both the Burger King “Whopper Sacriﬁ ce” (defriend 10 people, 
get a hamburger coupon) and a more recent Ikea-spooﬁ ng scam have 
revealed, Facebook users will sell out their friends for rewards large and 
small, whether real or fraudulent.
Finally, to the extent that Facebook is both free to use and expen-
sive to operate, the Open Graph model opens a fascinating array of 
revenue streams. If beggars can’t be choosers, users of a free system 
have limited say in how that system survives. At the same time, the 
global reach of Facebook exposes it to a broad swath of regulators, 
not the least formidable of whom come out of the European Union’s 
strict privacy rights milieu. As both the uses and inevitable abuses of 
the inﬁ nite metadata repository unfold, the reaction will be sure to be 
newsworthy.
Looking Ahead
Before we can look at GPS, or Facebook, or Amazon, it’s helpful to under-
stand that code’s unique properties precondition the range of behavioral, 
economic, and technical possibilities. Above all, code is in its essence par-
adoxical. It is ephemeral yet permanent; as a colleague once said, “Digits 
never die.” Code is malleable yet frustratingly complex. Code is both uni-
versal, particularly when deﬁ ned by powerful standards, and intimately 
personal: A given task can typically be performed any number of ways, 
and programmers develop stylistic “signatures.” Code can be fungible and 
intractable, as when a document looks different when opened on two 
seemingly similar PCs six inches apart.
Given these multiple layers of paradox, it is no surprise that so many 
facets of information, technology, and business strategy become puzzling, 
nonlinear, and counterintuitive as they are informed by the essential quali-
ties of the twenty-ﬁ rst-century’s lingua franca. Expect the situation to get 
more complicated, scarier, and farther reaching in the coming years as 
smartphones deﬁ ne more of everyday life.

CHAPTER 23
Sensors
Sensors are critically important building blocks of the digital world yet in their ubiq-
uity are often invisible. Not only are they worth appreciating for the elegance and clev-
erness of their engineering, but also sensors are on their way to generating a truly 
unimaginable proportion of the planet’s information. What held true for code is dou-
bly true of sensors: Value judgments, future possibilities, and economic interests are 
represented in architectures that typically operate beneath the threshold of human 
consciousness.
Historical Roots
To understand the current sensor landscape, let us step back for a moment 
to see its antecedents. Originally, a variety of sensors were invented to 
augment human senses. Examples include the telescope, microscope, ear 
trumpet, hearing aids, and other devices. With the advent of electro-optics 
and electromechanical devices, new sensors could be developed to extend 
the human senses into different parts of the spectrum (e.g., infrared, radio 
frequencies, measurement of vibration, underwater acoustics, etc.). Where 
they were available, electromechanical sensors:
 
 Stood alone
 
 Measured one and only one thing
 
 Cost a lot to develop and implement
 
 Had inﬂ exible architectures: They did not adapt well to changing 
circumstances

Growth in a Connected World

Sensors
Let’s discuss each of these points in turn. Sensors traditionally stood 
alone because networking them together was expensive and difﬁ cult. 
Shared technical standards were rare, so if one wanted a network of, say, 
offshore data buoys, the system of connections would be uniquely engi-
neered to a particular domain. Someone connecting sensors of a different 
sort (such as surveillance cameras) would have to start from scratch, as 
would anyone monitoring road trafﬁ c.
In part because of their mechanical componentry, sensors rarely mea-
sured across multiple yardsticks. The oven thermometer measured only 
the oven temperature and displayed the information locally, if at all. The 
electric meter only counted watt-hours. Now it’s common for a consumer 
Global Positioning System (GPS) unit, for example, to tell location, alti-
tude, compass heading, and temperature, along with providing weather 
radio.
Sensors were not usually mass-produced, with the exception of com-
mon items, such as thermometers. Because supply was limited, particu-
larly for specialized designs, the combination of monopoly supply and 
small order quantities kept prices high.
The rigid architecture was a function of mechanical devices’ speciﬁ c-
ity. A vibration sensor was different from a camera was different from a 
humidistat. Humidity data, in turn, was designed to be moved and man-
aged in a particular analog domain (a range of zero to 100%), while image 
recognition in the camera’s information chain typically featured extensive 
use of human eyes rather than automated processing.
Ubiquity
Changes in each of these four facets combine to help create today’s 
emerging sensor networks, which are growing in scope and capability 
every year. The many examples of sensor capability accessible to (or sur-
veilling) the everyday citizen shows the limits of the former regime:
 
 Computers, which sense their own temperature, location, user pat-
terns, number of printer pages generated, and so on.
 
 Thermostats, which are networked within buildings and now remotely 
controlled and readable.
 
 Telephones, the wireless variety of which can be understood as bea-
cons, bar-code scanners, pattern-matchers (the Shazam application 
names songs from a brief audio sample), and network nodes.
 
 Motor and other industrial controllers, including drive-by-wire throttle 
linkages, automated tire-pressure monitoring, and airbags’ accelerom-
eters and high-speed actuators.

Ubiquity 
245
 
 Vehicle components, often including an on-board diagnostics module, 
a toll pass, satellite devices on heavy trucks, and theft recovery ser-
vices such as LoJack, not to mention the inevitable mobile phone.
 
 Surveillance cameras (of which there are over 10,000 in Chicago 
alone, and more than 500,000 in London, England).1
 
 Some hotel door handles and many minibars, which are instrumented 
and generate electronic records of people’s and vodka bottles’ com-
ings and goings.
 
 Physical sensors, whether embedded in animals (radio-frequency 
identiﬁ cation [RFID] chips in both household pets and racehorses) or 
gardens (the EasyBloom plant moisture sensor connects to a computer 
via USB and costs only $50), or afﬁ xed to pharmaceutical packaging.
Note the migration from heavily capital-intensive or national-security 
applications down-market. A company called Vitality has even developed 
a monitoring system for something as simple as a pill bottle: If the cap is 
not removed when medicine is due, an audible alert is triggered or a text 
message could be sent.2
A relatively innovative industrial deployment of vibration sensors illustrates 
the state of the traditional ﬁ eld. In 2006, BP instrumented an oil tanker with 
“motes,” which integrated a processor, solid-state memory, a radio, and an 
input/output board on a single two-inch-square chip. Each mote could receive 
vibration data from up to 10 accelerometers, which were mounted on pumps 
and motors in the ship’s engine room. The goal was to determine if vibra-
tion data could predict mechanical failure, thus turning estimates—a motor 
teardown every 2,000 hours, to take a hypothetical example—into concrete 
evidence of an impending need for service.
The motes had a decided advantage over traditional sensor deploy-
ments in that they operated over wireless spectrum. While this introduced 
engineering challenges arising from the steel environment of ships as well 
as the need for batteries and associated issues (such as the fact that the 
lithium in some batteries is a hazardous material), the motes and their 
associated sensors were much more ﬂ exible and cost effective to imple-
ment compared to hard-wired solutions. The motes also communicate 
with each other in a mesh topology: Each mote looks for nearby motes, 
which then serve as repeaters en route to the data’s ultimate destination. 
Mesh networks are usually dynamic: If a mote fails, the signal is routed 
to other nearby devices, making the system fault-tolerant in a harsh envi-
ronment. Finally, the motes could perform signal processing on the chip, 
reducing the volume of data that had to be transmitted to the computer 
where analysis and predictive modeling was conducted. This blurring of 
the lines between sensing, processing, and networking elements is occur-
ring in many other domains as well.3

Sensors
All told, there are dozens of billions of items that can connect and 
combine in new ways. The Internet has become a common ground for 
many of these devices, enabling multiple sensor feeds—trafﬁ c camera, 
temperature, weather map, social media reports, for example—to combine 
into more useful, and usable, applications.
A popular term for this state of affairs is “the Internet of Things.”4 As 
we saw earlier, network effects and positive feedback loops mean that 
considerable momentum can develop as more and more instances con-
verge on shared standards. While we will not discuss them in detail here, 
it can be helpful to think of three categories of sensor interaction:
 1. Sensor to people. The thermostat at the ski house tells the occupants 
that the furnace is broken the day before they arrive, or a dashboard 
light alerts the driver that the tire pressure on the car is low.
 2. Sensor to sensor. The rain sensor in the automobile windshield alerts 
the antilock brakes of wet road conditions and the need for different 
traction-control algorithms.
 3. Sensor to computer/aggregator. Dozens of cell phones on a freeway 
can serve as beacons for a trafﬁ c-notiﬁ cation site, at much lower cost 
than helicopters or “smart highways.”
Current Examples
Less abstractly, the most mundane, low-tech activities of daily life are 
being transformed. Here are three: housecleaning, running, and parking.
Vacuuming
The Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner (see Figure 23.1) was introduced in 
2002 by iRobot, an MIT spinout that got its start building military robots for 
cargo hauling and mine snifﬁ ng. Roombas randomly cover an area,  sensing 
walls and furniture, before retreating to a predeﬁ ned dock for recharg-
ing. They are not particularly powerful but do spare people the  drudgery 
of one of housecleaning’s least rewarding tasks. As of 2010, more than 
5  million household robots had been sold, primarily the Roomba but also 
sibling units for ﬂ oor washing, gutter cleaning, and other tasks.
The device found a ready audience as beﬁ ts a classic disruptive inno-
vation: It underperformed the existing market on traditional standards, such 
as suction or dust-bag capacity, but introduced an entirely different axis of 
competition: freedom from drudgery and an acceptably clean ﬂ oor with zero 
effort. The Roomba quickly became a popular item on wedding registries.

Current Examples 
247
Once customers obtained their Roombas, a funny thing started hap-
pening: Many people named the appliances and described them in human 
terms. Seventy percent of people in a survey reported giving their robot a 
name, a gender, and a place in the family hierarchy. Broken robots were 
known to be “hospitalized.” The device does require maintenance: Fine 
dust can clog the sensors, for example, but people far preferred “groom-
ing” their robots to using a traditional appliance.
People reported adjusting both their habits (picking up more carefully 
the day before a scheduled run) or rearranging furniture in response to 
the device. One person threw away a shag rug because the Roomba was 
“getting frustrated” trying to clean it. Promotion was common: Owners 
would take the Roomba to their parents’ house to show it off, for exam-
ple, but felt protective of the device because of the hazards of a new, not-
yet-optimized environment.5
The outcome is counterintuitive: These robots, which are in essence a 
bunch of sensors and actuators networked through computing, evoke emo-
tional responses in people far more than the Roombas can sense anything 
about the people. To oversimplify, the inanimate watcher/doer becomes an 
emotional presence in the human environment. The phenomenon is not 
new: Many people name their Roomba R2D2, others the Terminator, evok-
ing robotic movie characters that generated large followings. In other cases, 
the vacuum becomes secondary: iRobot also sells educational robot pro-
gramming kits, essentially Roombas without the primary functionality.

Sensors
Running
Most people’s everyday experience with mobile wireless data originated 
with smart devices like a BlackBerry pager or iPhone or an OnStar tele-
matics system. The running of the Boston Marathon illustrates another sce-
nario. Ever since 1996, each of up to 40,000 runners had a transponder 
about the size of a quarter on his or her shoe. Hardwired sensor mats 
keep track of runners’ progress and prevent cheating. More recently, the 
system sends automatic e-mails to prearranged addresses, notifying fans of 
their friend’s progress and projected ﬁ nish time.6
In 2008, Nike teamed with Apple to link an accelerometer in the shoe 
(that counted footstrikes) to an iPod via a short-range wireless connec-
tion. (This arrangement was conceptualized as a PAN, or Personal Area 
Network. Bluetooth headsets are a classic example that uses the same 
technology as the Nike+.) The iPod supplies workout music and also pro-
vides audio feedback on time and distance markers, congratulations from 
Nike celebrity endorsers, and cumulative statistics. Maintaining personal 
ﬁ tness data became simpler, and then the sensors—more technically, the 
sensors’ home PCs—became networked, enabling people from different 
cities to “race” against each other or simply to compare their personal per-
formance on different days. As of mid-2011, Nike+ surpassed 425 million 
cumulative miles logged. The feedback provided by the electronic sensor 
is of an entirely different quality compared to a pedometer, paper mileage 
log, or other traditional device. In addition, the solitary activity becomes 
social; virtual teams compete to hit goals or beat other teams, often in 
conjunction with an actual event, such as a major marathon.
Parking
Parking meters* are hardly glamorous and rarely connote particularly 
advanced technology, but networking them together provides unexpected 
beneﬁ ts and consequences. A pilot deployment in San Francisco addresses 
many issues.
REAL-TIME INFORMATION San Francisco’s population can nearly double in 
a normal weekday, from 700,000 to 1.3 million. Up to 30% of automo-
bile trafﬁ c is estimated to be generated by people cruising, looking for 
an open spot. GPS sensors that record arrivals and departures for each 
spot are connected via wireless network to the city’s parking authority, 
* The technology that allows a car to automatically parallel park operates on a dif-
ferent, but no less interesting, set of sensors and controllers. See, for example, the 
Lexus system at http://bit.ly/480EvM.

where the information is posted to a Web site: all of the available spots 
are mapped, and inventory levels are current.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND Given accurate, up-to-date knowledge of available 
inventory, the city then prices parking in such a way as to maintain 15% 
of all spots open at a given time. High prices will deter some drivers, 
while heavy ﬁ nes for overstaying one’s meter might shorten visits.
PAYBACK The sensor technology is clearly expensive to install, but so too are 
the millions of person-hours wasted each day. Variable congestion pricing 
has been implemented in other cities, such as Stockholm and Singapore, but 
only at toll stations and/or bridges. Moving the locus of congestion pricing 
to the extended parking infrastructure eliminates a choke point and theoreti-
cally can dynamically adjust pricing to reﬂ ect current supply and demand.7
Phones as Sensors
Several factors make the rapid deployment of “smart” phones (that get 
smarter every year) a powerful force for change. We have more to say 
about these devices in other Chapters 12 and 27, but purely from a sensor 
point of view, eight factors are relevant:
 1. Massive deployment. On a planet of roughly 7 billion, there are more 
than 5 billion mobile phones in use.
 2. Networked. For every camera, every accelerometer, and every geoloca-
tor in these phones, there is a radio transmitter inches away.
 3. Powered. Getting power to a sensor network can be remarkably 
complicated. Those 5 billion sensor platforms are each attached to a 
human who presumably takes time to charge the device regularly.
 4. Human deployed. Imagine having to build a network of surveillance 
cameras to cover miles of freeway or hundreds of city blocks. The 
cost is considerable, and the odds of having a major event occur out 
of coverage remain high. With humans in a subway explosion, or 
near an accident site, or in the presence of a strange odor, people will 
reach for mobile devices and start generating images, coordinates, and 
other information immediately.
 5. A shared platform. Every mobile phone in the world can theoretically, 
if not economically, connect to any other.* No other sensor platform 
*Subject to the technical and economic limits on the number of possible combina-
tions imposed by the various network layers.

in history has been so big and so interconnected. Thermometers, 
speedometers, scales, radar—all of these stood alone.
 6. Read/write. In addition to sensing motion, or light, or bar codes, 
or sound, mobile phones can display results, processed versions of 
the input, authentication tokens, time/date stamps, and many other 
aspects of sensor-related information. Whereas a vibration sensor on 
a fence, for example, can send only what it measures, a camera that 
photographs a suspicious person or activity is connected to a display 
of image-recognition results, mug shots, or other relevant information.
 7. Metadata enabled. Not only can a cameraphone record and display 
a picture, it can encode and decode information about the current 
and past photos of the same attraction or person, announcing who 
or what the subject of the photo is. Facebook photo recognition and 
augmented reality apps such as Word Lens (which translates text of 
signs) are familiar examples.
 8. Mobile. Fixed sensor deployments required often highly sophisticated 
modeling to determine the location of sensors, networking infrastruc-
ture, power, security considerations, and other factors. Allowing the 
sensors to move can create gaps in coverage but also makes possible 
new kinds of approaches to data collection.
Looking Ahead
The whole planet is being instrumented from the bottom up—Weather 
Underground’s network of more than 30,000 volunteer weather stations is 
a long-standing example—with help from some very expensive top-down 
infrastructure in the form of GPS along with open-access satellite and aer-
ial imagery on Google Earth and elsewhere. Inexpensive and often redun-
dant hardware, running on mobile and wireless platforms, creates new 
possibilities for discovery, for convenience, and also for the invasion of 
privacy. Given the speed of deployment and innovation, we will be seeing 
more questions than answers in the coming years.
When Social Meets Sensors
At ski areas operated by Vail Resorts, visitors who want to share pho-
tos with their Facebook network have a new option. The EpicMix 
app launched in 2010 with an RFID tag inside the lift ticket (com-
monly used at many resorts to deter fraud) and a location-aware social

 network much like Foursquare. By passing through reader-equipped 
portals, skiers could track their vertical footage skied and com-
pete with their friends as well as complete tasks for Foursquare-like 
badges.
For 2011, EpicMix added photo sharing. According to Vail Resorts’ 
chief executive, Rob Katz, “There’s a lot of research out there that 
shows that the anticipation of a vacation, and the memories of it, are 
actually more valuable than the vacation itself. Photos are an important 
part of the memory aspect.”8 Here’s how it works: Professional pho-
tographers are stationed at key locations across the resort taking shots 
of skiers, who can have their tags scanned by the camera operator. 
The app automatically uploads a low-resolution image to the skier’s 
social network, free of charge. Higher-resolution images are available 
for purchase.
Given that high-deﬁ nition helmet cameras are readily available 
for rental and that people more and more routinely opt for camera-
phone images, the fact that the resorts give away professional images 
does not really cannibalize an existing revenue stream. The service 
builds goodwill with the resorts, improves the quality of the vaca-
tion memories, and shares the moment with the customer’s friends—
a useful variety of word of mouth. Given the differences between a 
ski area and an amusement park where roller coaster riders can buy 
photos at the ride, the sensor capabilities deliver location awareness 
and seamless identiﬁ cation of customers in a broad geographic area.

CHAPTER 24
The Internet and Other 
Networks
The Internet is both an engineering marvel, as much at the management layer as in its 
silicon and glass, and a powerful precursor to many of the possibilities we examine 
in this book: Whether we consider eBay, or Web video, or globally coordinated social 
protest, the way the Internet was designed and built establishes the limits of possibil-
ity for much of the modern world.
History has been made by a long series of networks. The Nile, the 
Euphrates, the Ruhr. England’s navy and colonies. The railroads. Wires for 
electricity and for communications. Eisenhower’s interstate highways. In the 
United States, ﬁ rst three then an explosion of television networks. FedEx’s 
air freight system. Wal-Mart’s trucks, marketing and supply-chain algorithms, 
and distribution centers.
These networks were built at particular times for particular purposes: 
The interstates could not haul rail cars and in fact helped drive U.S. passen-
ger rail essentially out of business. Electric wires could not carry information. 
The scale of capital investment often made network owners, whether in the 
public or private sectors, expand into adjoining economic niches: Railroads 
often owned hotels, while AT&T not only completed telephone calls, it made 
both the customer premise and capital equipment necessary to do so. These 
complementarities were typically physical, and logical extensions of the core 
service.
These networks had clearly visible hubs: London for the British 
Empire, Chicago for American rail, New York’s Broad Street for transat-
lantic telephone cables, the Strategic Air Command’s headquarters near 
Omaha, Memphis for FedEx, and Louisville for UPS.

Growth in a Connected World

254 
The Internet and Other Networks
To sum up, until the Internet, most major physical (as opposed to 
social) networks had several deﬁ ning characteristics:
 
 A network had a single purpose, or at most two, depending on the 
level of abstraction: The British used sea power to protect and con-
duct maritime trade as well as to project military power.
 
 Networks were expensive to build and operate, so they often became 
(or were treated as) natural monopolies.
 
 Networks were physically and geographically delimited. Interconnection 
(as with airline routes or intercountry phone calls) was possible but 
typically mapped on a 1:1 basis, with extensive negotiation and cus-
tomization for each pairing.
 
 Networks had visible centers of gravity, hubs where multiple links 
converged.
Legacy Telecom Network Principles
For roughly a century, these characteristics were tangibly embodied by AT&T 
and its equivalents around the world. Speaking speciﬁ cally of communica-
tions networks, three facts were often taken as axiomatic before the Internet:
 1. Networks, whether AT&T’s premise equipment or British Telecom’s 
transatlantic assets, were closed. U.S. wireline companies in particu-
lar controlled their networks with notoriously tight standards, helping 
ensure reliability at the cost of innovation.
 2. Because one company, or a tightly linked consortium, had con-
trol, network engineering was conducted under known operating 
assumptions.
 
 Latency, or systemic delay in signal transmission, was highly 
predictable.
 
 Similarly, the parameters of available bandwidth, or carrying capac-
ity, were known with great reliability within the network operations 
center or its equivalent.
 
 The location of network elements and their respective  characteristics—
the overall topology—was known with certainty.
 
 Network assets were closely administered, in locked-down facilities, 
by technicians with highly standardized training. If X happened in 
any facility, the correct response was almost always known to be Y.
 3. Given these factors, operating costs were reasonably well understood 
for such a complex system. At the corporate level, however, costs were 
only semirelevant because revenues were set by regulators in most 
every country.

Defense Origins of the Internet 
255
Defense Origins of the Internet
The Internet grew from origins in the U.S. defense community in the 
early 1960s. It was built to solve the problem of survivable communica-
tions: Given the amount and broad dispersal of nuclear weaponry, ground 
troops, naval assets, and so on, the commander in chief needed to get 
messages to all relevant parties extremely quickly no matter what and 
then those various resources had to be able to coordinate.
Two key technologies deﬁ ne the Internet’s topology. First, information 
is digital, chopped into binary elements of 1s and 0s rather than a continu-
ous analog representation. Whether a pixel in an image, a slice of a musical 
waveform, or a digital representation of a keyboard character, bits can be 
moved more robustly than analog signal, which degrades with multiple re-
ampliﬁ cations. A Xerox of a Xerox of a Xerox gets successively less legible; 
a bit is much more likely to survive multiple handoffs intact.
Second, the links in the network were made redundant. If each node 
has three or more possible short pathways available and bits can be 
handed off repeatedly without degradation, a system of multiple short-hop 
pathways can route around the fact of any given node being unavailable.
Given these two design decisions, Paul Baran of the RAND 
Corporation went to work:
I ﬁ gured there was no limit on the amount of communications 
that people thought they needed. So I ﬁ gured I’d give them so much 
communications they wouldn’t know what the hell to do with it. 
Then that became the work—to build something with sufﬁ cient 
bandwidth so that there’d be no shortage of communications. The 
question was, how the hell do you build a network of very high 
bandwidth for the future? The ﬁ rst realization was that it had to 
be digital, because we couldn’t go through the limited number of 
analog links.
For redundancy to be cost effective, the cost of the components 
had to drop. This was a direct contradiction of AT&T doctrine, 
in which very expensive, highly engineered pieces at each step of 
the  circuit-switched infrastructure were the norm. Unfortunately, the 
“star” topologies of such systems provided little redundancy and very 
vulnerable targets at the network core.
Baran continued:
You can build very, very tough networks—by tough I mean a high 
probability of being able to communicate if the two end nodes 
 survive—if you had a redundancy level of about 3. The enemy

The Internet and Other Networks
could destroy 50, 60, 70 percent of the targets or more and it would 
still work. It’s very robust. That was the thing that struck me. . . .
If you were going to build a network with redundancy, that 
tells you right there how many paths you need. There’s no choice. 
At the same time, you don’t have to use high-priced stuff anymore. 
Because in the analog days both ends of the connection had to 
work in tandem, and the probability of many things working in 
tandem without failing was so low that you had to make every part 
nearly perfect. But if you don’t care about reliability any more, 
then the cost of the components goes way down.1
The net result is a more reliable network based on cheaper, less reliable 
components: The idea of inexpensive redundancy as opposed to overen-
gineered single-path fault-tolerance has taken hold elsewhere in computer 
 science, in the areas of cloud computing and disc storage, for example.
Baran’s resulting conceptual picture (Figure 24.1) clearly indicates the 
robustness of the distributed topology.

Internet Principles 
257
Internet Principles
The global Internet that resulted from the work of Baran and other pio-
neers stood in nearly total contradiction to any network ever built. Its 
closest antecedent, the telephone system, did not prepare anyone for 
what would soon become possible after the National Science Foundation 
released it to commercial use in the early 1990s. The Internet was new in 
several important ways.
 
 The Internet was open. Anyone could serve content with minimal 
investment in infrastructure and a simple, nonproprietary naming con-
vention. Viewing and receiving information was free: Every computer 
connected to the Internet can in theory connect to any other, inde-
pendent of distance.
 
 Because of the robust network engineering underlying the Internet, 
engineering assumptions that held true in the Bell era had to be 
rethought. Because no one company could build a network of the 
Internet’s scale, it is properly considered as a network of networks.
 
 Accordingly, any given interaction could traverse numerous trans-
porting entities. Latency cannot be predicted.
 
 Throughput (often confusingly called bandwidth) varies, sometimes 
considerably. If one is on a cable modem, for example, that house-
hold is sharing resources with about 150 other homes. After work, 
network trafﬁ c can surge when people log on, download movies, or 
whatever, and available bit rate can drop. Similar phenomena occur 
at other layers in other networks.
 
 The topology of any given communication is both ad hoc and 
inconsistent. Packets of information are sent through available 
pathways; the routing decisions for any given packet are made 
in millionths of a second, so multiplying the number of packets 
times the number of “hops” will generate a truly large number for 
a load the size of a movie, for example. The packets seldom arrive 
in the order they are sent, so reconstructing the coherence of a 
human voice, for example, can be more technically challenging 
than, say, stapling together an e-mail. The location of the desired 
content relative to its intended recipient thus becomes an important 
consideration.
 
 The Internet is not “administered” but rather held together by work-
ing understandings and more or less formal technical standards. 
When things break, ﬁ nding the source and solution can be difﬁ cult, 
as in denial-of-service and other attacks on universities, govern-
ments, and infrastructure.

The Internet and Other Networks
 
 The economics of an essentially self-administered network of net-
works led to considerable business model challenges. In the words of 
Internet observers David Isenberg and David Weinberger, building on 
the insight of telecommunications analyst Roxane Googin, “[T]he best 
network is the hardest one to make money running.”2
The truth of this paradox can be found in the difﬁ cult path of 
delivering high-speed Internet access to large numbers of people. 
Creating the right mix of incentives and protections has been difﬁ -
cult in the United States, which lags most of its peers in deployment, 
in network speed, and in price. According to OECD data shown in 
Figure 24.2, the results are consistently disappointing.3 The United 
States has consistently slow speeds, low penetration, and high prices 
relative to other developed countries.
Defenders of the status quo point to population density, but 
Iceland’s is lower than the United States yet it leads the world in 
deployment. Proponents of government policy point to Korea, 
a country roughly the size of New Jersey and with a much more 
homogenous culture. Japan has very fast connections, but its  economy

has not obviously beneﬁ ted from broadband leadership. Finland, 
however, has made broadband a legal right of citizenship and prom-
ises 100 megabits per second connections by 2015.4 The paradox of 
the best network is alive and well, as the share prices of Internet car-
riers attest: No carrier has beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500 index in 
the last ﬁ ve years.
Consequences of Internet Principles
We are still in the midst of discovering and understanding all of the many 
implications of an open, global, digital network of networks. A few of 
these follow:
 
 The vast quantity of innovation that resulted from this open posi-
tion is still stunning, even in retrospect. Without rules or assumptions 
about how the Internet might be used, people created a vast array of 
techniques, services, archives, data sets, and other resources.
 
 The speed of innovation can be understood through analogy. 
Consider many different railroad companies, each working indepen-
dently with tracks of slightly different gauges. Network effects are not 
as strong as they could be, and any innovation is stranded on its iso-
lated network. With the Internet riding on its single set of standards, 
all innovation can build on the shoulders of giants and spur still more 
innovation. The history of search engines in the 1990s is a case in 
point, as commercial advances in information retrieval far outpaced 
academic theory. Facebook’s leapfrogging of MySpace serves as 
another case in point.
 
 Vulnerabilities can be truly frightening in their scale. Bots, trojans, and 
viruses can move at ridiculous speeds. Compromised computers from 
all over the world are mobilized by remote control, out of sight of 
antivirus software, to invade people’s privacy, steal their money, and 
disable their civic and technical infrastructure. Simple human error—a 
mistyped command into the wrong computer—can bring entire sys-
tems down.
 
 Once everything becomes bits, the Internet does a superb job of 
 moving them. Telephone networks transported voice then fax. Radio 
stations broadcast music and voice. Television carried video, but in a 
different way from movie theaters. Now the same edge device (a PC 
or smartphone, for example) can access vast quantities of news, or 
music, or stock trades, or books, or photographs, or maps, or geo-
graphic coordinates. Furthermore, those many information types can 
be readily intermingled.

The Internet and Other Networks
 
 Business models for the Internet are particularly tricky. Traditional 
control of choke points and toll gates, whether through patents, geog-
raphy, brand, or other means, can be difﬁ cult to enact and to enforce. 
Because the network of networks is inherently robust, it routes 
around choke points as a matter of course.
 
 It sounds obvious, but the Internet supports phenomena with strong 
network effects. E-mail (and spam), social networking of the LinkedIn 
or Facebook sort, large-scale distributed self-organization (e.g., 
Wikipedia), and eBay are all examples of phenomena that could not 
have taken hold on any prior network structure.
 
 Place and space diverge. The physical location of a resource seldom 
matters for information purposes, as long as one knows its virtual 
whereabouts. While Facebook or Google operate huge data centers, 
their physical locations matter little to the services’ users.
Looking Ahead
Despite the issues with wired broadband access, in the United States in 
particular, the rapid rise of the wireless high-speed Internet promises 
broader access, more innovation, and new unintended consequences. The 
science of networks, both social and technical, is advancing rapidly with 
developments in economics, physics, biology, and sociology.5 Routers* get 
bigger and faster, ﬁ ber-optic cables are still being steadily deployed, inno-
vations in optics mean increased performance and carrying capacity from 
the core infrastructure, and innovations in business models mean more 
people can do more things, connected to more people, each year. For 
all of its paradoxes, challenges, and vulnerabilities, the Internet remains a 
cultural and engineering marvel, in many ways the salient fact of modern 
life in many parts of the world.

CHAPTER 25
Location Awareness
Even though they’re sometimes overlooked in relation to spectacular growth rates 
(50-fold increases in wireless data carriage), successful consumer applications (nearly 
a billion Facebook users), and technical achievement (at Google, Amazon, Apple, and 
elsewhere), location-based technologies deserve more attention than they typically 
receive. The many possible combinations of wired Internet, wireless data, vivid dis-
plays, well-tuned algorithms running on powerful hardware, vast quantities of data, 
and new monetization models, when combined with location awareness, have yet to 
be well understood.
Digital location-based services arose roughly in chronological paral-
lel with the commercial Internet. In 1996, General Motors introduced the 
OnStar navigation and assistance service in high-end automobiles. Uses 
of Global Positioning System (GPS, which, like the Internet, was a U.S. 
military invention, as Figure 25.1 shows) and related technologies have 
exploded in the intervening years, in the automotive sector and, more 
recently, on smartphones. The widespread use of Google Earth in televi-
sion newscasts is another indicator of the underlying trend.
Sales of handheld GPS units continue to double every year or two in 
the North American market. As the technology is integrated into mobile 
phones, the social networking market is expected to drive far wider adop-
tion. Foursquare, Facebook Places, numerous other start-ups, and the tele-
com carriers are expected to deliver more and more applications linking 
“who,” “where,” and “when.” Powerful indications of this tendency came 
when Nokia bought NAVTEQ (the “Intel inside” of many online mapping 
applications) for $8.1 billion in 2007, when Facebook integrated location 
services in 2010, and when the rapid adoption of the iPhone and other

smartphones ampliﬁ ed the market opportunity dramatically. Location-
based services (whether Skyhook geolocation, Google Maps and Earth, 
GPS, or others) have evolved to become a series of platforms on which 
speciﬁ c applications can build, tapping the market’s creativity and vast 
quantities of data.
In the process, the evolution of location relates to signiﬁ cant 
questions:
 
 Who am I in relation to where I am? That is, what are the implications 
of mapping for identity management?
 
 Who knows where I am, when I’m there, and where I’ve been? How 
much do I control the “information bread crumbs” related to my 
movements? Who is liable for any harm that may come to me based 
on the release of my identity and location?
 
 Who are we relative to where we are? In other words, how do social 
networks change as they migrate back and forth between virtual 
space (Facebook) and real space (Mo’s Bar)? What happens as the 
two worlds converge? That is, as a person walks down the street and 
an everyday smartphone can capture his or her face, the connection 
of the face to its data can happen pretty much instantaneously. Few 
people are comforted by this scenario.

Variations on a Theme 
265
Variations on a Theme
While location often seems to be synonymous with GPS, location-based 
data services actually come in a variety of packages. Some examples follow.
Indoor Positioning Systems
For all of the utility of GPS, there are numerous scenarios where it doesn’t 
work: Mobile X-ray machines or patient gurneys in hospitals, people in 
burning buildings, work-in-process inventory, and specialized measure-
ment or other tools in a lab or factory all need to be located in sometimes 
vast and often challenging landscapes, usually within minutes. GPS signals 
may not penetrate the building, and even if they can, the object of interest 
must “report back” to those responsible for it. A variety of wired and wire-
less technologies can be used to create what is in essence a scaled-down 
version of the GPS environment.
Optical
Such well-known ﬁ rms as Leica and Nikon have professional products 
to track minute movements in often massive structures or bodies: dams, 
glaciers, bridges. Any discussion of location awareness that neglects the 
powerful role of precision optics, beginning with the essential survey-
or’s transit, would be incomplete. As they merge with other precision 
technologies such as lasers, optical instruments become more accurate 
still.
Wi-Fi Mapping
The worldwide rise of Wi-Fi networking is very much a bottom-up phe-
nomenon. Two consequences of that mode of installation are: often lax 
network security and considerable coverage overspill. Driving down any 
suburban or metropolitan street with even a basic wireless device reveals 
dozens of residential or commercial networks. Such ﬁ rms as Google have 
systematically mapped those networks, resulting in yet another overlay 
onto a growing number of triangulation points. The privacy implications 
of such mapping have yet to be resolved.
Cellular
Wireless carriers can determine the position of an active (powered-up) 
device through triangulation with the customer’s nearby towers. Such an 
approach lacks precision when compared to approaches (most notably 
c25.indd   265

266 
Location Awareness
GPS) that reside on the handset rather than in the network. In either case, 
the carrier can establish historical location for law enforcement and poten-
tially other purposes.
Skyhook
A start-up based in Boston, Skyhook has built a database of 250 million 
Wi-Fi physical coordinates then added both GPS and cellular compo-
nents, making it most precise (inside or near buildings) where GPS is 
weakest. A software solution combines all available information to create 
location tracking for any Wi-Fi–enabled device, indoors or out. Skyhook 
powers location awareness for devices from Apple, Dell, Samsung, and 
other companies and is now generating secondary data based on those 
devices.
Landmarks
Noting a few historic transitions and innovations in the history of location-
based services reveals the scale, complexity, and wide variety of applications 
that the core technologies are powering.
OnStar
With roughly 5.5 million subscribers as of mid-2010, OnStar has become 
the world’s largest remote vehicle-assistance service. In addition to receiv-
ing navigation and roadside assistance, subscribers can have doors 
unlocked and gain access to certain diagnostic data related to that par-
ticular vehicle. The service delivers important information to emergency 
response personnel: When extricating occupants from a damaged vehicle, 
knowing which airbags have deployed can help keep emergency medi-
cal technicians, police, and ﬁ reﬁ ghters safe from the explosive force of 
an undeployed device that might be inadvertently tripped. Knowing the 
type and severity of the crash before arrival on the scene can also help 
the teams prepare for the level of damage and injury they are likely to 
encounter.
The service was launched as a joint venture. General Motors brought 
the vehicle platform and associated engineering, Hughes Electronics 
managed the satellite and communications aspects, and Electronic Data 
Systems, itself being spun out from GM in OnStar’s launch year, per-
formed systems integration and information management.

GPS
The history of GPS is even more compelling when considered along-
side its nearly contemporary stablemate, the Internet. GPS originated in 
1973, the Internet’s DoD predecessor ARPANET in 1969. Ronald Reagan 
allowed GPS to be used for civilian purposes after a 1983 incident involv-
ing a Korean Air Lines plane that strayed into Soviet airspace. The Internet 
was handed off from the National Science Foundation to commercial use 
in 1995; Bill Clinton ordered fully accurate GPS (20-meter resolution) to 
be made available May 1, 2000. Previously, the military had access to the 
most accurate signals while “Selective Availability” (300-meter resolution) 
was delivered to civilian applications. If an object was big enough (a ship 
or aircraft), multiple receivers could be networked to generate higher res-
olution: 1-meter accuracy in 2000. Twenty-four satellites orbit the earth to 
provide the service.
Since 1990, GPS has spread to a wide variety of uses: recreational 
hiking and boating, commercial marine navigation, cell phone geoloca-
tion, certain aircraft systems, and of course vehicle navigation. Heavy min-
ing and farming equipment can be steered to less than inch tolerances. 
Vehicles (particularly ﬂ eets) and even animals can be “geofenced,” with 
instant notiﬁ cation if the transmitter leaves a designated area. In addition 
to latitude and longitude, GPS delivers highly precise time services as well 
as altitude.
Trimble
Founded by Charles Trimble and two colleagues from HP in 1978 (the 
ﬁ rst year a GPS satellite was launched), Trimble Navigation has become 
an essential part of geolocation history. From its base in Silicon Valley, 
the company has amassed a portfolio of more than 800 patents and offers 
more than 500 products. Much like Cisco, Trimble has made acquisi-
tion of smaller companies a core competency, with many merger-and-
acquisition moves in the past 10 years in particular. A measure of 
Trimble’s respect in the industry can be seen in the quality of its joint-
venture partners: Both Caterpillar and Nikon have gone to market jointly 
with Trimble.
The company has a long history of ﬁ rsts: the ﬁ rst commercial 
 scientiﬁ c-research and geodectic-survey products based on GPS for oil-
drilling teams on offshore platforms, the ﬁ rst GPS unit taken aboard the 
space shuttle, the ﬁ rst circuit board combining GPS and cellular com-
munications. The reach of GPS can be seen in the variety of Trimble’s 
product offerings: agriculture, engineering and construction, federal

government, ﬁ eld and mobile worker (including both public safety and 
utilities applications), and advanced devices, the latter indicating a signiﬁ -
cant commitment to research and development.
Location, Mobility, and Identity
Issues of electronic identity and mobility have been playing out in 
quiet but important ways. Each of several instances is a classic case of 
social or economic problems being tangled up with a technology chal-
lenge. To see only one side of the question is to create the possibil-
ity of unintended consequences, allow hidden agendas into play, and 
generally confuse the allocation of sometimes-scarce resources. At the 
same time, seeing the issues holistically requires time, perspective, 
and often resources: For example, Americans take the 911 system for 
granted but seldom realize how complex and fragile the infrastructure 
actually is. Each of these examples hints at forthcoming challenges and 
opportunities.
Social Networking Goes Local
Whether through Dodgeball (a New York start-up that was bought by 
Google in 2005 then left unexploited), Foursquare, or Facebook Places, 
the potential for the combination of virtual and real people in virtual or 
real places is still being explored. Viewed in retrospect, the course of 
the Dodgeball acquisition raises the revenue questions familiar to watch-
ers of social networks dating from Friendster et al. onward: Who will pay 
for what, and who collects, by what mechanism? Who owns my location 
information, and what aspects of it do I control? Much like my medical 
records, which are not mine but rather the doctor’s or hospital’s, control 
appears to be defaulting to the collector rather than the generator of digi-
tal bread crumbs, at least in the United States: In Europe, privacy laws and 
attitudes generally favor the citizen.
The Breakdown of 911
After a series of implementations beginning in 1968, Americans on wireline 
voice connections could reliably dial the same three-digit emergency num-
ber anywhere in the country. As the Bell System of the twentieth  century 
fades farther and farther from view, the presumption of 911 reliability 
declines proportionately with the old business model even as demand 
increases: The United States generates about 250 million calls a year to 911. 
The problem comes in two variants.

Location, Mobility, and Identity 
269
First, a number of Voice over Internet Protocal (VoIP) customers with 
life-threatening—and as it turned out, life-ending—emergencies could 
reach only a recording at Vonage saying to call 911 from another phone. 
The Texas attorney general raised the question after a 911 call failed dur-
ing a home invasion in Houston. A baby’s death in Florida in 2005 was 
blamed on a Vonage 911 failure. According to the Wall Street Journal, 
“In a letter to Florida’s Attorney General, [the mother] said the Vonage 
 customer-service representative laughed when she told her that Julia had 
died. ‘She laughed and stated that they were unable to revive a baby.’”1
For their part, Vonage and the cable operators include bold-print 
instructions for manual 911 mapping during the sign-up process, but it’s 
been estimated by the U.S. Department of Education that between 14 and 
22% of the U.S. population is functionally illiterate.2 In addition, one fea-
ture of VoIP is its portability: Plug the phone into an Internet connection 
anywhere and receive calls at a virtual area code of the customer’s choice. 
Children are also a key 911 constituency. Taken collectively, these over-
lapping populations raise dozens of tricky questions. At the infrastructure 
level, the Federal Communications Commission and other agencies face 
the substantial challenge of determining the fairest, safest set of technical 
interconnection requirements incumbent on the Regional Bells and VoIP 
carriers.
From the Bell perspective, 911 obviously costs money to implement 
and maintain, and declining wireline revenues translate to declining 911 
funds. Connecting 911 to the Internet in a reliable, secure manner is 
 nontrivial—network attacks have used modems to target the service in the 
past—and until contractual arrangements are ﬁ nalized, the Bell companies 
are reluctant to subsidize the same ﬁ rms that present themselves as full 
wireline replacements.
In addition, 911 isn’t just a VoIP problem: Cellular users represent 
nearly 75% of emergency callers, but math and economics conspire to 
make ﬁ nding them difﬁ cult or impossible. In rural areas, cell towers often 
follow roads, so attempting to triangulate from three points in a straight 
line can limit precision. Some states have raided 911 tax revenues for bud-
get relief, limiting funds for further reﬁ nement.
Cell Phone Tracking
Wireless carriers offer a variety of services that give a relative (often a 
parent or an adult child of a potentially confused elder) location infor-
mation generated by a phone. The service also has been used to help 
stalkers and abusive spouses ﬁ nd their wives in hiding. Women’s shel-
ters routinely strip out the tracking component of cell phones; according 
to the Wall Street Journal, a Justice Department report in 2009 estimated

that 25,000 adults in the United States were victims of GPS stalking every 
year.3 In addition to the carriers, tracking capability is being developed by 
sophisticated PC users that spoof the behavior of a cell tower. Keystroke- 
and location-logging software is also available; one package, called Mobile 
Spy, costs under $100 per year.
Looking Ahead
As the telephone system migrates from being dominated by ﬁ xed lines, 
where identity resided in the phone, to mobile usage, where identity typi-
cally relates to an individual, location is turning out to matter a lot. Mobile 
number portability was an unexpectedly popular mandate a few years 
ago, for example. Given the global nature of some of these questions, 
not to mention numerous issues with global governance over IP addresses 
and domain naming conventions, the discussions and solutions will only 
get more complicated. As the examples illustrate, getting social arrangements 
to keep pace with technology innovation, is if anything, more difﬁ cult than 
the innovation itself.

CHAPTER 26
Clouds
Given extensive and ever-faster connections over both air and ﬁ ber optics, the location 
of computing power relative to the user of said horsepower has become negotiable. 
Because of the need to do hard things in the service of a smartphone, the awareness 
of massive inefﬁ ciencies in the power consumption of ﬁ xed computers, and the cost 
and complexity of the systems that support a given server, ofﬂ oading some of the 
infrastructure to a specialized provider that operates at a huge scale makes sense in 
ways it did not in the era of the personal computer and local area network.
The proliferation of so-called cloud computing platforms has been 
rapid. Because there is so much material available that deﬁ nes the phe-
nomenon (see Figure 26.1), we’ll move here to an examination of some 
of the unexpected consequences and complicated implications of moving 
some or all of a computing environment to offsite, third-party environ-
ments. We will ﬁ nd that the impact of the Internet, as a conduit for both 
communications and computing, extends far beyond the data center.
To get the problematic and inevitable deﬁ nitional question out of the 
way, here is one from Information Week’s John Foley: “Cloud computing 
is on-demand access to virtualized IT resources that are housed outside of 
your own data center, shared by others, simple to use, paid for via sub-
scription, and accessed over the Web.”1
There are of course other contending deﬁ nitions, but Foley’s is merci-
fully brief. Even so, it begs the questions of private clouds, of how small 
a cloud can be before it starts being something else, and how individual 
uses of clouds (many people don’t own a data center but satisfy most of 
Foley’s other conditions) vary from and overlap corporate ones. It does 
get us started in more or less the right direction.

Clouds
Both Technical and Economic Innovation
It’s important to note that cloud computing is as much, or more, a mat-
ter of economics than of processing cycles: Who invests capital? What 
products or services are bought and sold or produced and consumed? 
HP and IBM have long made boxes that created compute capacity; 
Amazon and Google now sell computing capacity without the box. 
The end user’s business need has not changed—calculating a com-
plex model, recognizing revenue, analyzing transaction histories—but 
the way resources are organized to meet that need can be radically 
different.
According to one of the few canonical documents on the topic, a 
technical report from the University of California at Berkeley, these eco-
nomic differences are expressed in hardware in three main ways:
1. The illusion of inﬁ nite computing resources available on 
demand, thereby eliminating the need for cloud computing 
users to plan far ahead for provisioning.
2. The elimination of an up-front commitment by cloud users, 
thereby allowing companies to start small and increase hard-
ware resources only when there is an increase in their needs.
3. The ability to pay for use of computing resources on a short-
term basis as needed (e.g., processors by the hour and storage 
by the day) and release them as needed, thereby rewarding

conservation by letting machines and storage go when they are 
no longer useful.2
The rapid pace of change in this area is such that we must add to 
that list. Marc Benioff is chief executive ofﬁ cer of Salesforce.com, which 
helped pioneer important aspects of software as a service, a progenitor 
of modern cloud computing. He further differentiates Amazon, Google, 
IBM, and other ﬁ rst-generation cloud providers from YouTube, Twitter, 
and Facebook, all of which, as home to new kinds of applications, serve 
as cloud providers of a different sort.
As Benioff notes, ﬁ rst-generation clouds were notably low in cost, fast 
at the compute level, and easy to use. The beneﬁ ts of the second generation 
are different: They include collaboration, mobility, and real-time capabili-
ties.3 Thus, the blurring line between hardware (cloud support of lightweight 
mobile devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones) and people-
powered beneﬁ ts, including incredibly rapid information dissemination and 
mass collaboration, becomes difﬁ cult to trace but important to monitor.
Cloud Computing and the Enterprise
Those large-scale social network cloud behaviors generally are limited to the 
consumer market, for the moment anyway. Let’s return to enterprise comput-
ing: As various analysts and technology executives assess the pros and cons 
of cloud computing, two points of consensus appear to be emerging:
 1. Very large data centers beneﬁ t from extreme economies of scale.
 2. Cloud success stories generally are found outside of the traditional 
IT shop.
Let us examine each of these in more detail, then probe some of the 
implications.
Advantages of Scale
Whether run by a cloud provider or a well-managed enterprise IT group, 
very large data centers exhibit economies of scale not found in smaller 
server installations. The leverage of relatively expensive and skilled tech-
nologists is far higher when one person can manage between 1,000 and 
2,000 highly automated servers, as at Microsoft, as opposed to one person 
being responsible for between 5 and 50 machines, which is common.

Clouds
In addition, the power consumption of a well-engineered data cen-
ter can be more efﬁ cient than that of many traditional operations. Yahoo! 
built a new facility in upstate New York, for example, that utilizes atmo-
spheric cooling to the point that only 1% of electricity consumption is 
for air-conditioning and related cooling tasks.4 Having people with deep 
expertise in cooling, power consumption, recovery, and other niche skills 
on staff also helps make cloud providers more efﬁ cient than those running 
at smaller scales. The engineering challenges at this scale are themselves 
new and often fascinating.
Also, large data centers beneﬁ t from aggregation of demand. Assume 
facility A has 10,000 users of computing cycles spread over a variety of 
different cyclical patterns while facility B has fewer users, all with simi-
lar seasonality for retail, quarterly closes for an accounting function, or 
monthly invoices. Facility A should be able to run more efﬁ ciently 
because it has a more “liquid” market for its capabilities while facility B 
will likely have to build to its highest load (plus a safety margin) then 
run less efﬁ ciently the majority of the time. What Amazon Distinguished 
Engineer James Hamilton calls “non-correlated peaks” can be difﬁ cult to 
generate within a single enterprise or function.5
IT Organizations Have Yet to Reap the Cloud’s Beneﬁ ts
For all of these beneﬁ ts, external cloud successes have yet to accrue to 
traditional IT organizations. At Amazon Web Services, for example, of 
roughly 200 case studies, none is devoted to traditional enterprise pro-
cesses such as order management, invoicing and payment processing, or 
human resources.6
There are many readily understandable reasons for this pattern; here 
is a sample of four. First, legal and regulatory constraints often require a 
physical audit of information handling practices to which virtual answers 
are unacceptable. Second, the laws of physics may make large volumes of 
database joins and other computing tasks difﬁ cult to execute off- premise. 
In general, high-volume transaction processing currently is not recom-
mended as a cloud candidate.
Third, licenses from traditional enterprise providers, such as Microsoft, 
Oracle, and SAP, are still evolving, making it difﬁ cult to run their software 
in hybrid environments (wherein some processes run locally while others 
run in a cloud). In addition, only a few enterprise applications of either 
the package or custom variety are designed to run as well on cloud infra-
structure as they do on a conventional server or cluster. Fourth, accounting 
practices in IT shops may make it difﬁ cult to know the true baseline costs 
and beneﬁ ts to which an outside provider must compare: some chief infor-
mation ofﬁ cers never see their electric bills, for example.

The Cloud Will Change How Resources Are Organized 
275
The Cloud Will Change How Resources Are Organized
For these reasons, among others, the conclusion is usually drawn that 
cloud computing is a suboptimal ﬁ t for traditional enterprise IT. However, 
let’s invert that logic to see how organizations have historically adapted to 
new technology capability. When electric motors replaced overhead drive 
shafts driven by waterwheels adjoining textile mills, the looms and other 
machines were often left in the same positions for decades before mill 
owners realized the facility could be organized independently of power 
supply. More recently, word-processing computers from the likes of Wang 
initially automated typing pools (one-third of all U.S. women working in 
1971 were secretaries); it was not until 10 to 20 years later that large num-
bers of managers began to service their own document-production needs 
and thereby alter the shape of organizations.7
Enterprise IT architectures embed a wide range of operating assump-
tions regarding the nature of work, the location of business processes, 
clock speed, and other factors. When a major shift occurs in the infor-
mation or other infrastructure, it takes years for organizations to adapt. If 
we take as our premise that most organizations are not yet prepared to 
exploit cloud computing (rather than talk about clouds not being ready 
for “the enterprise”), what are some potential ramiﬁ cations?
 
 Organizations are already being founded with very little capital invest-
ment. For a services- or knowledge-intensive business that does not 
make anything physical, free tools and low-cost computing cycles can 
mostly be expensed, changing the fundraising and indeed organiza-
tional strategies signiﬁ cantly.
 
 The perennial question of “who owns the data?” enters a new phase. 
While today USB drives and desktop databases continue to make it pos-
sible to hoard data, in the future, organizations built on cloud-friendly 
logic from their origins will deliver new wrinkles to information- 
handling practices. The issue will by no means disappear: Google’s 
Gmail cloud storage is no doubt already home to a sizable quantity of 
enterprise data.
 
 Smartphones, tablets, and other devices built without mass storage can 
thrive in a cloud-centric environment, particularly if the organization 
is designed to be ﬂ uid and mobile. Coburn Ventures in New York, for 
example, is an investment ﬁ rm comprised of a small team of mobile 
knowledge workers who for the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve years had no corporate 
ofﬁ ce whatsoever: The organization operated from Wi-Fi hotspots, 
with only occasional all-hands meetings.
 
 New systems of trust and precautions will need to take shape as the core 
IT processing capacity migrates to a vendor. It’s rarely  consequential to

contract for a video transcoding or a weather simulation and have it 
be interrupted. More problematically, near-real-time processes such as 
customer service likely will need to be redesigned to operate success-
fully in a cloud or cluster of clouds. Service-level agreements will need 
to reﬂ ect the true cost and impact of interruptions or other lapses. 
Third-party adjudicators may emerge to assess the responsibility of the 
cloud customer that introduced a hiccup into the environment relative 
to the vendor whose failover failed.
Practical Considerations
Because the cloud model introduces innovations in both economics and 
technology, making educated purchasing and deployment questions 
requires new metrics, models, and potentially skills.8 Some practical ques-
tions illustrate the complexity of changing organizational, operational, 
physical, legal, and computational models on the ﬂ y:
 1. From the buyer’s perspective, what is a vendor’s proﬁ t path? What can be 
differentiated and thus generate margins? Compared to the conventional 
model of data centers, which is often measured in $10,000 or $100,000 
increments, cloud computing usage at Amazon is measured in dimes.
 2. Related to point 1, how does cloud lock-in vary from existing soft-
ware (à la classical Microsoft) or hardware (the vintage IBM model) 
variants? And let’s return to that initial Berkeley document: When 
resources are “released” for other users, where does my data go? If 
it is in the cloud, the resources can’t all be released for other pur-
poses, and if the data moves out of the cloud back to my premise, we 
both lose cloud advantages (such as power management) and intro-
duce security considerations: Who validates the hard-disk scrub when 
I retreat from the shared resource?
 3. How will incumbents respond? If company A has an established busi-
ness selling hardware as capital expenditure, and a competing model 
shifts compute power to an operating-expense model, presumably 
company B doesn’t stand still. How do buyers hedge risk with such a 
dynamic vendor environment?
 4. As with so much of the world’s infrastructure, what is the incentive to 
invest in “pipes” when the value-add lies elsewhere, or nowhere? The 
robust, high-speed networks upon which the cloud providers rely 
cannot simply be assumed.
 5. If for legal or other reasons the buyer needs performance, security, 
and/or reliability guarantees, how are these delivered if the buyer can-
not see or physically access her assets?

Practical Considerations 
277
 6. There are no free lunches: who bears risk? Every one of the Web’s elite 
destinations has suffered from major outages at some point.9 In light 
of that history, what does a fault-tolerant cloud environment look like, 
require, and cost? As with so many networked scenarios, the price 
of failure goes up: When Amazon suffered a cloud outage in 2011, it 
took dozens of companies without backup down with it.
 7. How does optimization work in a cloud? The vendor may be manag-
ing to power consumption, say, while customer A wants stable (not 
necessarily fast, but predictable) transaction times for a shopping-cart 
scenario. Customer B needs fast compute capability despite big and 
frequent reads and writes to disc. How can all three parties go home 
happy at the end of the day?
 8. How can virtual, hybrid environments be tested before major real-
world events: a quarterly close, a consumer promotion, a currency 
meltdown? While there will be some pure cloud successes, a big ques-
tion relates to how well clouds can integrate with existing data centers 
and other assets. (What constitutes unit testing in a cloud?)
 9. What can a customer ask for by way of customization? Who can and 
will provide it, and at what costs in money and performance? The 
price points reﬂ ect commodity economics, but sooner or later most 
buyers stumble on needs that surpass plain vanilla.
10. Which standards are open and which are proprietary? The PC archi-
tecture ﬂ ourished in part because of its interoperability: someone 
could choose a big Maxtor hard drive or a faster Seagate, a Dell ﬂ at-
panel or Sony Trinitron display, and the hardware maker could buy 
the cheapest CD drives, memory, and power cords on a given day. 
USB made the platform more ﬂ exible yet. By comparison, once buy-
ers choose a cloud provider, how must they choose an Internet ser-
vice provider, a system management vendor, a billing system? In short, 
what are the dependencies introduced by a cloud instance?
11. How fast is fast enough? Cloud computing is a coherent-sounding 
phrase, but computing has many facets. Think about the different time 
scales relating to
 
 Network latency
 
 The laws of physics regarding hard drive access
 
 The laws of physics regarding hard drive failure
 
 Core competency versus utility workload allocation
One size clearly cannot ﬁ t all.
12. Who guarantees precision? Speaking of laws of physics, all micropro-
cessors are not created equal. Some highly precise calculations, out 
to many decimal points, might run slightly differently on two differ-
ent computing cores. How does the user of a given scientiﬁ c calcula-
tion, for example, know that his or her result will be consistent across

Clouds
computing instances, across different clouds, or across brands of 
processor?
At the end of the day, orchestrating all of those sets of events, each 
with its own timescape, in a virtual world is a really, really tough techni-
cal and managerial problem. Getting the systems to work doesn’t even 
scratch the questions of proﬁ tability, liability, audit and related require-
ments, and so on.
Looking Ahead
For all of those substantial challenges, the question is not whether cloud 
computing will happen but rather how this tendency will unfold and how 
organizations, regulators, and other actors will respond. Until the rhetoric 
and more important the base of experience moves beyond the current state 
of pilots and vaporware, the range of potential outcomes is too vast to bet 
on with any serious money. Those problems are soluble. The larger impli-
cations are already becoming visible. As cloud computing reallocates the 
division of labor within the computing fabric, it will also change how man-
agers and, especially, entrepreneurs organize resources into ﬁ rms, partner-
ships, and other formal structures. Once these forms emerge, the nature of 
everything else will be subject to reinvention: work, risk, reward, collabo-
ration, and indeed value itself.

CHAPTER 27
Wireless
The path to today’s smartphone has many branches: the Bell system, for certain, but 
also large government contracts, a grassroots networking protocol, and many clever 
architects and programmers. These developer communities can either be independent 
or in the service of the computing giants: Adobe, Google, Microsoft, and of course 
Apple. The iPhone proved to be a breakout device for many reasons.
While we talk about cell phones with the emphasis on “phones,” the 
smartphone is far from being an extrapolation from Bell’s original device. 
The iPhone’s naming convention makes a certain amount of sense, but 
it’s not really a phone: Person-to-person voice communication is maybe 
a ﬁ fth of its value. Calling it an ultraportable computer would not have 
worked; I defer to the marketing genius behind this extraordinarily suc-
cessful product. But the fact remains that the smartphone has much more 
to do with computing than with traditional voice.
Precedents
Even the term “smartphone” needs to be deﬁ ned carefully. The  original 
Amazon Kindle, for example, allowed only rudimentary Web access, 
eschewing the Swiss Army knife approach in favor of intense concentration 
on one core activity: reading. Amazon is routinely secretive about com-
petitive issues and thus has given no ﬁ rm indication of how many readers 
are out there. Given the massive software sales—Kindle titles outsell all 
print editions on the earth’s biggest bookstore—hardware sales have to be 
robust. The Kindle is, in point of fact, a single-purpose mobile device, with 
the Sprint wireless network utilized to facilitate the instant downloads of 
new purchases on the airport tarmac, for example. Broadband access costs 
are bundled into some combination of hardware (including ad revenue

from the low-price variant) and book revenue, invisible to the customer 
but a mobile data transaction nevertheless.
The Apple iPad presents similar deﬁ nitional issues. Lacking a hard drive 
and a hardware keyboard/mouse, it’s not really a laptop, yet it duplicates con-
siderable functionality. At the same time, it can’t make voice calls or send and 
receive text messages unless the user jumps through some hoops. For our 
purposes, the iPad counts as a large smartphone rather than a small com-
puter; most of the factors in this section work to explain the tablet’s success.
The following trends, some coming from unrelated domains, converge 
in the contemporary smartphone.
Miniaturization
In the 1950s, the IBM RAMAC featured a 5-megabyte hard drive (drum 
storage) that weighed about 1,000 pounds and was the size of a large 
washing machine. Fifty-plus years later, solid-state memory gets smaller 
and faster at a predictable rate, to the extent that 64 gigabytes (about 
10,000 times more) had shrunk to a package weighing about 1.5 ounces, 
or 10,000 times smaller. Combined, that’s improvement by a factor of 100 
million—not to mention the cost, which has declined by a slightly smaller 
factor.
Most any component of a smartphone has been miniaturized, if not by 
such a dramatic multiple (see Figure 27.1, which shows Nokia’s progress 
in this regard). GPS units used to be carried in backpacks; they now ﬁ t in 
a pocket. High-resolution color displays were formerly built from cathode-
ray tubes; the LCD then OLED* display (and the miniaturization thereof) is 
an often-overlooked part of the smartphone’s success. Batteries, antennas, 
even speakers—the list goes on.
Usability
Cramming all the functionality of a contemporary smartphone into a 
tiny package is an engineering accomplishment, to be sure, but what’s 
even more noteworthy is how the market has been “trained” to accept 
the trade-offs that come with the packaging. Voice quality, for example, 
remains an issue, as does wireless data coverage. Dropped calls, which 
rarely happened on traditional wirelines, are met with the shrug of a 
shoulder: Expectations have been downsized in that particular domain. 
* Organic Light-Emitting Diode technology is brighter and uses less power than 
LEDs, among other beneﬁ ts.

Ringtones, however, are customizable, which generated substantial reve-
nue for the carriers in the period from 2004 to 2007 particularly.
Texting is another area where the carriers were surprised when a second-
ary piece of capability emerged as a major market in its own right. Originally 
a kludgey workaround on GSM* networks in the 1990s, Nordic and some 
Asian teens used the Short Messaging Service (SMS) as a way to avoid the 
heavy voice tariffs that were designed to capture revenue from the rapidly 
increasing base of users. Uptake has been nearly universal on every conti-
nent, moving from the original strictly text-based service to include sound, 
photo, and video variants as bandwidth and device capability improve.
The Apple iPod trained people to dock their devices to a computer 
and, later, to buy content from an online storefront. As the form of that 
content migrated from songs to movies to software, users could take small 
steps up a ladder of increasing complexity. Experiments with a stylus, on 
*Global System for Mobile Communications, originally Groupe Spécial Mobile, 
denoted the standards used for second generation (2G) wireless telephony in 
European markets.

the Palm Pilot and Apple Newton, in the mid-1990s helped pave the way 
for full touch-screen operation, a step that Nokia and BlackBerry are ﬁ nd-
ing it difﬁ cult to take. One factor in the smartphone’s success, then, is the 
development of native mobile operating systems that gracefully support the 
wide range of functionality in an on-the-move context. Early versions of 
Windows CE and Windows Mobile, meanwhile, treated the smartphone as 
a small desktop, down to ﬁ le folder metaphors, which newer designs have 
resisted.
Fungibility of Sound, Voice, Video, Text
Not that long ago, digital communications was format speciﬁ c: Reading a 
magnetic stripe card, playing a compact disc, taking a digital photograph, 
or watching digital video each required its own piece of equipment. In 
the smartphone, voice bits can move over a cellular carrier or over Skype; 
video can be recorded, edited, uploaded, and/or consumed; still images 
go to Flickr or Facebook; e-reader applications duplicate the function of 
the book or newspaper; and MP3 ﬁ les can play through the earphones 
just as easily as any other kind of sound. Not only can the smartphone 
manage all those different media types, the Internet can move them with 
equal ease and low cost.
GPS
As we saw in Chapter 25 and elsewhere, GPS has become essential for 
both consumer way-ﬁ nding and industrial applications as well as military 
coordination. The migration of location awareness into the smartphone 
involves GPS, to be sure, but also the Wi-Fi mapping efforts of Google 
Maps and such services as Skyhook. On top of the U.S. government’s 
core system, such private-sector players as NAVTEQ (now part of Nokia) 
and TomTom along with Google’s powerful Maps and Earth tools com-
bine to offer extensive geographic capability to smartphones and tablets.
Radio
As much as the iPhone has stressed the cellular network, the picture 
would be far worse if Wi-Fi had not picked up so much of the load. 
According to comScore, 47.5% of iPhone trafﬁ c is handled by Wi-Fi; 
Google Android smartphones move 78% of their data over cellular net-
works, while iPads are 92% Wi-Fi centric.1 The role of Wi-Fi in the success 
of the smartphone is all the more important for two reasons: These are 
ad hoc networks that were not built with a government stimulus package, 
c27.indd   284

a spectrum purchase, or a conscious deployment plan; and every trans-
action over Wi-Fi spares the often-overtaxed cellular system, which was 
deployed at great cost. This ofﬂ oading of bandwidth explains the steady 
variation in mobile pricing plans: As video gains in importance and more 
people carry smartphones (now estimated to be about a third of the U.S. 
market), unlimited plans become less attractive to carriers.
The importance of a robust wireless data network is obvious to any-
one who has tried to download even simple content over slow con-
nections. The tens of billions of dollars spent by U.S. carriers alone on 
spectrum licenses, tower rights and real estate, and networking equipment 
can at times be overlooked, but like electricity, it’s painfully obvious in its 
absence.
After Wi-Fi and cellular, the third radio in their smartphone that few 
people think about much belongs to Bluetooth, the close-range protocol 
used mostly for headsets but also for printing and keyboards. Named for 
a Scandinavian king from the tenth century who united warring tribes, 
the standard ﬁ lls an important gap for which higher-power (and battery-
depleting) protocols would be undesirable. After the Bluetooth special 
interest group (a common factor in technology platform development) 
was formed in 1998, the standard was rapidly adopted and only six years 
later could be found in 250 million different devices. At its 10-year anni-
versary, 2 billion devices had been shipped.2
Software Developers
More than 15 billion pieces of software had been downloaded to 
iPhones as of mid-2011. Amazing as that number is, Apple has a log 
of every single one, even the free ones, through its App Store ERP* 
backbone. As good as its design and hardware might be, the iPhone’s 
success relies in large measure on Apple’s reinvention of the global 
software market in only a few years. A vast ecosystem of software 
developers has created more than 500,000 approved applications for 
the iPhone, and Android developers have been essentially as busy. 
One indication of the primacy of the “ecosystem” is the separation of 
Android and Apple from the rest of the smartphone market: The Nokia 
and BlackBerry hardware might be superior, in theory, but app selec-
tion is severely lagging. Because platform dynamics are in force (see 
Chapter 5), developers and customers ﬂ ock to the market leaders, fur-
ther marginalizing the laggards: Feedback loops and network effects 
can be powerful at this global scale.

On the handset front, meanwhile, Apple confronts the question of 
how to reach the next 50 million users and the next 50 million after that, 
given that many of those people will be using non-alphanumeric lan-
guages, such as Chinese and Arabic. Stand-alone hardware companies 
scramble for software partners: Motorola is being acquired by Google, 
HTC and Samsung debate how safe it is to stay on Android, and Nokia is 
betting on its alliance with Microsoft. Each combination brings a distinc-
tive package of strengths and weaknesses to the table as they ﬁ ght for 
market share in a global contest for hardware supremacy in a new order. 
Whatever happens, we will be confronted by growth rates the likes of 
which no manager (or capital market) has ever seen, each with its own 
raft of unintended consequences.
The Breakthrough
The Apple iPhone was not the ﬁ rst or the most technologically capable 
smartphone. (IBM introduced a prototype in 1992.) Why, then, did it 
break through to broad market success? Not to enter the realm of Apple 
hagiography, but Steve Jobs presided over ﬁ ve deﬁ ning moments* in the 
history of computing. Getting lucky could explain one, or even two, suc-
cesses, but the overall pattern must be recognized: Jobs understood some-
thing about the power of great design and smooth user experience that 
led to a no-prisoners demand for easy-to-use, and even fun-to-use, prod-
ucts in a way no other U.S. tech executive has been able to deliver on a 
consistent basis.
Jobs and Apple got a lot of little things, along with some big ones, 
close enough to right to make the iPhone the standard-bearer for a critical 
phase of the smartphone’s market development. Google’s Android plat-
form has since done extremely well, but surprisingly, given the powerful 
global players in competition—Samsung, Motorola, Research In Motion, 
Nokia, and Microsoft—it is currently a two-horse race. How did Apple 
jump into a segment as an outsider and proceed to set the agenda for an 
entire industry?
 
 Appl e managed the price curve. $499 (which AT&T was not allowed to 
discount from the outset) yielded an estimated 50% margin,  according 
* The ﬁ ve products were the original Macintosh with graphical user interface and 
unboxed hardware design; Pixar computer animation; and the iPod, iPhone, and iPad 
since 2001. Apple’s share price multiplied thirty-eight-fold in the 10 years following 
the iPod announcement.

to iSupply, which does market research on bill-of-materials costs. That 
proﬁ tability, however, allowed Apple to cut the price after the early 
adopters paid a premium, and economies of scale dropped the cost of 
the inputs. Even after other touch-screen smartphones came to market, 
Apple could charge premium prices. In part, this relates to Apple’s 
supply-chain effectiveness, which shows up in procurement, logistics 
(inbound, outbound, and product returns), manufacturing quality, and 
on-time launches.
 
 The form factor works. Other smart devices with rich visual inter-
faces have failed to translate well as handsets for conversations: The 
BlackBerry is great from the thumbs’ point of view but less attractive 
to mouth and ears. Looking at global markets, many young SMS users 
can text blindfolded. The iPhone’s smooth screen doesn’t allow this 
kind of typing, yet the drawback hasn’t been a major factor in sales. 
Dispensing with the stylus, judged as risky at the time, proved to be a 
very smart decision.
 
 Apple understood the Swiss Army knife factor. All-in-one devices 
reduce footprint, but few chefs rely on a red pocket knife to slice 
cheese, bone meat, and dice carrots. And who’s ever used the saw 
for anything? The point here is that the iPhone’s range of capabilities 
is good enough to make it acceptable for nearly any relevant activity. 
Digital camera and video camera sales are falling; the iPhone is the 
most commonly used camera by people who upload images to Flickr.3 
The GPS functionality of smartphones is hurting the share prices of 
TomTom, Garmin, and their kin. Apart from e-readers such as the 
Kindle and Nook, few portable electronic devices are stand-alone any 
longer—Apple’s own falling iPod sales testify to the trend. Even game 
consoles are expected to be surpassed by smartphones in the coming 
years.4 
 
 The device works. Apart from some issues with the iPhone 4 antenna/
case, Apple has made the product sufﬁ ciently reliable and robust to 
survive the rigors of tens of millions of users’ many habits, abuses, and 
extremes of environment. Battery life, overall durability, voice quality, 
and data security are all good enough for most of the market, and usabil-
ity apparently is more important than any single aspect of functionality.
 
 Apple has masterfully built a partner network. Ranging from Foxconn, 
which does assembly in China, to FedEx, to component suppli-
ers, to the developer network, and to movie studios and record 
labels, the Apple extended ecosystem is big, capable, and on-task. 
Signiﬁ cantly, Apple seized control of the handset from the wire-
less carriers, whose earlier gatekeeper role had allowed them to 
set much of the mobile agenda. By creating must-have hardware, 
Apple forced AT&T and then other carriers to accede to terms and

 conditions no other  handset manufacturer had been able to win. 
Customer service is Apple’s, high-margin extended warranty revenues 
are Apple’s,  advertising is approved by Apple, and pricing is set by 
Apple. Compare the Windows 7 smartphone launch in 2010, in which 
AT&T was offering two handsets for the price of one just weeks after 
the product came to market.
 
 The retail channels for the iPhone are important. Apple has massive 
foot trafﬁ c—74.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, more than all 
of Major League Baseball and more than how many visited a Disney 
theme park—into its own stores. There the product education function 
of the heavily scripted Genius bar experience helps introduce nontech-
nical buyers who might lack a family Mac-head to get them started. At 
more than $5,600 in sales per square foot, Apple stores measure nearly 
double the rate of Tiffany, the traditional leader in that metric.5
 
 Launching into a mature mobile market with powerful incum-
bents, high capital intensity, and well-deﬁ ned roles, Apple elevated 
its level of execution. In contrast to the music market into which 
the iPod launched in 2002, which was characterized by tumbling 
share prices at the labels, distribution of the capital base (record-
ing studios and pressing plants) to millions of PC owners, and few 
megaselling titles, the wireless industry has consolidated to a small 
number of global network operators, equipment manufacturers, 
and handset ﬁ rms. The scale of wireless is almost unfathomable: 
At the time of the iPhone launch, Apple had sold about 100 million 
iPods in ﬁ ve years, which is a huge number in the PC industry. 
In the fourth quarter of 2006, Nokia all by itself sold 102 million 
handsets.
 
 Design-wise, Apple invented a new category of device, learning from 
previous failures. In the music player case, Apple integrated a far supe-
rior music management software application with its version of the 
MP3 player and implemented copy protection to satisfy the labels that 
their 99-cent songs would not be copied indeﬁ nitely. In the iPhone 
case, Apple took a variety of lessons from Motorola’s ROKR music 
player+phone, which had its iPod/iTunes license pulled. Rather than 
being a follow-up to the extremely successful RAZR phone, the ROKR 
is essentially the answer to a trivia question.
 
 Apple once again used superior industrial design, elevated to the level 
of art, to create unsurpassed “cool” factor in a category. The micro-
scopic attention to coherence and detail in the iPod, from market-
ing, to packaging, to peripherals, to product endorsers, created an 
 emotional appeal found in few electronic devices, and the iPhone 
built on that foundation. Few other companies have that kind of prec-
edent to live up to and to build from.

 As venture capitalist John Doerr noted, Apple has a vast army of users 
trained to sync their device with a computer.6 It’s an installed base of 
user behavior that gave the iPhone a jump-start in adoption.
 
 The iPhone captured momentum amidst industry disruption, and 
with its success consolidated several trends. As mobile broadband 
emerged from competing standards and platforms, the iPhone domi-
nated a multiradio niche just at the moment that heterogeneous cover-
age became a reality. Working at the ofﬁ ce? Going abroad? Working 
in a Starbucks hotspot? Surﬁ ng on a train in the Northeast Corridor? 
Customers found that having a uniﬁ ed device to maintain connectivity 
across access technologies proved extremely valuable.
 
 Unlike many previous successes, the iPhone is not powered by a sin-
gle “killer application.” In the case of the iPod, it was clearly iTunes 
music management and legal downloads. With the iPhone, voice-
mail is handy, but fewer people rely on voice communications. 
Texting and typing support is good; the BlackBerry and in some cases 
Android devices are better. Maps and way-ﬁ nding are excellent, but 
days or weeks might go by between uses if the device owner is on 
her home turf. The point is that as compared to the spreadsheet for 
the early PC, for example, or Internet access for 1990s laptops, the 
device supports whatever the user requires: Major League Baseball’s 
At Bat app is great, but that doesn’t explain the iPhone’s success. 
Facebook and social games play well, but not for everybody. Weather 
and news can be viewed through many handy services.
Looking Ahead
As we saw in Chapter 12, the mobile phone is having extended implica-
tions across the world, and not only in the realm of entertainment and 
convenience. Once the majority of the world’s technology users connect 
to the Internet through a smartphone or related device, we will see even 
broader changes: What does it mean never to have to be captive to a 
wire for any form of information retrieval? What does it mean to have the 
phone become your date book, your wallet, the window to your music 
“collection” (whatever that term will come to mean), your photos, and 
so many other deﬁ ning artifacts? After Apple built on the achievements 
of Palm, of Nokia, of Trimble, of Samsung, and of Research In Motion, 
so now will Google and perhaps Nokia/Microsoft attempt to leapfrog the 
iPhone franchise. Ultimately, the winner in such a high-stakes competition 
among powerful ﬁ rms will be a whole new generation of customer who 
will be less and less tolerant of any sense of limits on the power of what 
could be the twenty-ﬁ rst century’s deﬁ ning device.

Power and Portability
Wireless telephony is in many ways a challenge to basic physical 
laws. Miniaturization proceeds apace as manufacturing techniques 
and materials science advance. Signal quality and availability improve 
with advances in radio. The ﬁ nal frontier may be batteries, subject as 
they are to the laws of chemistry and ultimately physics.
Until the early 1990s, nickel-cadmium batteries were used in 
most portable electronics applications. Nickel is obviously heavy, 
however, and cadmium is environmentally toxic. In contrast, lithium 
is extremely light and holds more energy per unit of weight than any 
other metal. It is, however, unstable and thus dangerous. Lithium ion 
batteries, introduced by Sony in 1991, actually have no lithium metal, 
being made instead of cobalt, carbon, copper, and iron. Accordingly, 
the U.S. government classiﬁ es lithium ion batteries as a nonhazardous 
waste stream. But because all the metals involved are common, there 
is little economic incentive to recycle them. As of 2006, American 
threw away an estimated 2 billion lithium ion batteries per year.7
Current research into battery innovation focuses on weight (or 
energy density) and recharging time. Reﬁ nements of the lithium ion 
model appear feasible, but no breakthrough replacement appears to be 
imminent. In addition, recharging using body motion is being investi-
gated, as is wireless transmission of power (currently at very short 
range). Recharging pads for mobile devices are commercially available, 
and similar technology is used on electric toothbrushes, which are used 
in wet environments where open electrical contacts could be dangerous.

CHAPTER 28
Search
While widespread availability of search technology is only about 15 years old, its 
implications continue to accumulate. Work and commerce, medical care and mate 
ﬁ nding, crime and education all are being reshaped by an effectively inﬁ nite base of 
information made usable by various types of search, indexing, and related technolo-
gies. In addition, search is closely related to substantial changes in how knowledge is 
generated, stored, and distributed.
It remains to be seen how the search era will be positioned in the 
grand sweep of human intellectual progress. In the short term, several 
interrelated facets of search should be noted: context, value, impact, and 
future constraints.
Why Search Matters: Context
Search is in many ways the deﬁ ning tool of the Internet age. Digital data 
is ever easier to generate, more of our entertainment takes digital form, 
globally dispersed actors can ﬁ nd each other and coordinate, and the 
number of sources of information continues to multiply. As we saw in 
Chapter 6, the long tail of content production requires search and other 
matching technologies (including word of mouth and algorithmic “if you 
liked this you might like that” matching).
Information Volume Is Multiplying
Many sources of information have been separated from their location. 
Compare the Internet to national and university research libraries, which

Information, Technology, and Innovation: Resources for  
Growth in a Connected World

Search
required dozens or hundreds of years to assemble, cost millions of dol-
lars to sustain and maintain, and employed large staffs of experts in such 
specialties as acquisitions, cataloging, bookbinding, and archival manage-
ment. Early search technologies used text-string matching, but Google’s 
major breakthrough was in hyperlink analysis: Links were, in essence, 
votes on a given site’s value. In the past decade, metadata matching and 
semantic analysis (does the searcher mean “ﬁ eld” as in wheat, magnetic, 
or career?) have made strides. As a result, technology has made billions 
of megabytes of information available to billions of people. Those people 
can be anywhere and in any number, so information access is no lon-
ger restricted by physical presence. In addition, the virtual resource can 
be used by as many people as need it at a given instant, unlike physical 
books or microﬁ lms.
Furthermore, raw data can be consumed and transformed without 
traveling to physical laboratories or research stations. Weather satellite 
data, Web-based laboratories for remote experimentation, virtual shared 
instruments, and worldwide access to webcams or data buoys are only a 
few examples of shared data sources. National and international statistical 
authorities are further sources of information that scholars can transform 
into more formalized outputs.
Finally, repositories of knowledge have different gatekeepers. Books 
and paper journals are no longer the deﬁ nitive word in some ﬁ elds, given 
how long editorial review and publishing can take. Blogs, e-mails, and 
videos can ﬁ nd a worldwide audience in just hours, not months or years. 
As a result, formal cataloging systems for books and journals are not nec-
essarily the authoritative taxonomies of a given ﬁ eld.
Search Changes Information Access
In some ways, access to knowledge has been democratized—many 
tools, formerly restricted to researchers at a relatively few well-endowed 
research institutions, including search engines themselves, are now widely 
available. One example would be LexisNexis licenses, which cost tens of 
thousands of dollars.*
At the same time, however, literacy is not universal, and search lit-
eracy requires a particular form of skill and discernment that is not equally 
distributed. Search results frequently lack context and in many instances 
do not speak for themselves. Knowing what one is looking for can be 
surprisingly difﬁ cult, notwithstanding the simplicity implied by the clean 
input screen. Finally, search results are not objective, yet the results imply

293
an algorithmic ranking in order of ﬁ tness, accuracy, or popularity that can-
not be assumed yet is difﬁ cult to consciously override.
Search Technologies Reinforce Economic Trends
Search has long been recognized as a stage in many transactions, but 
Google-scale digital search also plays a role in several broad-based eco-
nomic tendencies.
 
 Search costs factor into nearly every economic transaction: As buy-
ers and sellers both need to discover each other, compare needs and 
capabilities, and coordinate, search engines have facilitated easier 
matching of parties to a transaction.1
 
 Although many people casually speak of an “information economy,” 
Stanford professor Paul Romer developed an academic formulation for 
it around 1990. Commonly known as new growth theory, the Romer 
theory asserts that land, labor, and capital are no longer the build-
ing blocks of a modern economy. Instead, he asserts that ideas create 
a signiﬁ cant fraction of an economy’s value. Conventional economics 
would portray the end of the petroleum era as implying the end of 
transportation. But in Romer’s view, human innovation will develop 
new fuel sources and economically viable technologies for utilizing 
them, then harvest market rewards for doing so.2 In such an environ-
ment, search technologies become essential for making an information 
economy run.
 
 In Thomas Friedman’s formulation, “the world is ﬂ at” insofar as cer-
tain kinds of value creation become physically removed from their 
consumption.3 Nurses have to be in the same room as their patients to 
give injections or take temperatures, but equity analysts or radiologists 
can be thousands of miles away from the user of their knowledge. 
Search is both a cause and an outcome of the ﬂ attening process as it 
makes both formal and informal knowledge accessible to anyone with 
an Internet connection at any time.
 
 Information is no longer distributed only by broadcast methods. 
Two inﬂ uential books—Chris Anderson’s The Long Tail4 and Nassim 
Nicholas Taleb’s The Black Swan5—both analyze how power-law dis-
tributions explain increasing numbers of events. In the physical world, 
distributions of height must absolutely fall on a Gaussian distribu-
tion, and all examples are within 1 order of magnitude: Every human 
stands between 1 foot tall and 10 feet tall. In contrast, information 
landscapes, most obviously the World Wide Web, see billions of page 
views on a fat-tail distribution where about 1% of Web sites receive 
roughly 50% of all trafﬁ c.6 The remaining half is spread over billions

Search
of pages, some with tiny audiences, the so-called long tail of the 
power-law distribution. Here there are no barriers as to who can serve 
as editorialist, editor, or publisher. To navigate online auction sites, 
bookstores, or music services, search becomes an essential service. To 
perhaps oversimplify, there would be no long tail of content without 
search engines, and the world would have less need for search with-
out long tails.
Search Changes the Rules of Information Assembly
For thousands of years, assembling information has conferred many ben-
eﬁ ts, including strategic or tactical advantage, prestige, and erudition. 
Because books were so valuable, many titles were chained to the shelves 
in Greek libraries and later in the Sorbonne and elsewhere.7 The inven-
tion of the public circulating library was closely connected to the realm of 
political organization: Benjamin Franklin was intimately involved in both 
the development of public libraries and the American Revolution. Such a 
connection separates him from many political ﬁ gures, regardless of era.
Over the centuries, the emphasis of libraries migrated from assembly 
(as at Alexandria) to classiﬁ cation. The most notable example of the latter 
was the French encyclopedists, including Denis Diderot, but the U.S. Library 
of Congress system stands as another signiﬁ cant milestone. In the Internet 
period, assembly, such as at the Internet Archive, has fallen to a lower pri-
ority, given the power and ubiquity of search. Because Google and its peers 
render both classiﬁ cation and assembly less important, ﬁ nding information, 
rather than owning or organizing it, is often the predominant task.
The Wide Reach of Search
Because search has so rapidly become part of the pattern of everyday 
life for so many people, remembering how life was transacted before 
AltaVista, Excite, Google, and Bing can be difﬁ cult. A brief list suggests 
some of the many domains that have already been reshaped by this trans-
formative technology. Each of these is at least a $100 billion industry in 
the United States; Google is less than 15 years old, making the transforma-
tions that much more remarkable.
Media
While Google obviously reinvented the advertising model, other media 
industries have been deeply affected. YouTube (part of Google) helped 
change video viewing habits from scheduled to searched. MP3 ﬁ les are

The Wide Reach of Search 
295
routinely searched online rather than scanned in physical bins. Google 
News assembles stories with algorithms rather than editors. Such resources 
as the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), owned by Amazon, ﬁ gure promi-
nently in search results. Finally, search and matching technologies are at 
the core of the success of Netﬂ ix relative to its physical competitors.
Retail and Secondary Markets
Finding used auto parts, or rare baseball cards, or any of the other mil-
lions of items on Craigslist or eBay would be impossible without search. 
Amazon invested so heavily in its A9 search service that it competed 
head-to-head with Google for a brief while. Extensive comparison shop-
ping based on price, quality, or location becomes a matter of mouse clicks 
rather than hours or days of work.
Healthcare
According to the Pew Internet and American Life Project, 80% of Internet 
users (or 59% of all U.S. adults) search for medical information online.8 
This has signiﬁ cant implications for the entire healthcare industry, from 
the doctor-patient relationship to sellers of niche (and potentially ineffec-
tive) remedies.
Employment
People born before 1980 will remember requesting friends to mail the 
Sunday help-wanted ads from remote cities, which would then arrive 
the following Thursday, so that application letters could be mailed to post 
ofﬁ ce boxes. In a very short time, the entire process of job hunting has 
been transformed, largely by search.
Automobiles
From a situation where information asymmetry was extreme (see Chapter 3), 
and buyers greatly mistrusted both new- and user-car sellers, the Internet has 
helped bring about greater transparency into both vehicle pricing and used-
car history.
Travel
In some ways, search leveled the playing ﬁ eld between small hotels and 
megachains as do-it-yourself trip planning replaced visits to a travel agent 
or supplemented branded toll-free reservations systems. Air fares get

Search
easier to compare every year, in part by the addition of new features to 
the major search engines. In multiple ways, search helped alter and dimin-
ish the role of the travel agent.
Hospitality
As with lodging, millions of online word-of-mouth recommendations 
for restaurants have reshaped the industry. With mobile search, ﬁ nding 
“Chinese restaurants near me” becomes a simple matter, complete with 
directions.
Real Estate
While real estate agents have not been disintermediated (see Chapter 21), 
the search technologies available at a range of sites have reshaped the 
house-hunting and rental process. Once again, the combination of search 
and location-based technologies proves to be particularly powerful.
Valuing Search
Even before the Web, according to Kevin Kelly, the founding editor of 
Wired *, U.S. searches added up to 111 billion a year, most of them direc-
tory assistance telephone calls, but he also counted librarian queries. After 
the invention of free search engines, people appear to be asking more 
questions: The measurement ﬁ rm comScore estimated 3 billion searches 
per day at Google alone. Twitter serves more than 1.5 billion searches per 
day. The list goes on.
In Kelly’s rough estimate, an unnamed Google employee hypotheti-
cally and unscientiﬁ cally values these searches as follows. Here are his 
assumptions in a thought exercise:
1/4 of all searches are really easy ones (like ‘american airlines’) 
that save the user maybe 30 seconds;
1/4 are a little hard and save maybe 5 minutes;
1/4 are just wasting time, and
1/4 are hard ones that lead to substantial savings—like diag-
nosing your serious disease, or choosing the right college, or the 
right vacation destination.

297
Suppose it takes 10 searches on average to get one of these 
“hard” answers, but when you get it, you’ve saved maybe 3 hours. 
That averages out to 6 minutes saved/search. Figure average 
income of $25,000/year, or $12.50/hour. So we get a value of 
$1.25/search by this metric.9
Assuming the U.S. audience as 2 billion searches per day at that $1.25 
per search, and Google’s market share of roughly 65%, that would mean 
that Google creates $584 billion of value for its U.S. users per year.
Given these unofﬁ cial numbers and that this is only a thought experi-
ment, even if the numbers are off by a factor of 5, it still means that Google 
creates 25 cents of value with the average search, at a cost to serve in the 
range of 0.2 cents. That would represent a hundredfold ratio of customer 
well-being to cost, a stunning value proposition by any measure.
A more rigorous valuation was performed by the McKinsey Global 
Institute.10 Again, the numbers get very large. Moving beyond the conven-
tional metrics for search valuation—time savings, price transparency, and 
increased awareness—the McKinsey study instead proposes a model with 
nine inputs:
 1. Better matching of information to need
 2. Time savings
 3. Increased awareness
 4. Price transparency
 5. Long-tail access
 6. People matching
 7. Problem solving
 8. New business models
 9. Entertainment
Building from these disparate categories, the study estimated global 
measurable value created by search at $780 billion. Importantly, some of 
this fails to register in gross domestic product: Increased consumer surplus 
from getting a better deal, for example, or from saving time as in the previ-
ous example, is not counted. In any event, the magnitude of these sources 
of value, economic and otherwise, will only grow in the coming years.
Looking Ahead
In the past decade, search has facilitated the broadly decentralized produc-
tion of information. Finding one’s way among a continually growing volume 
of data and information will be shaped in part by three current forces:
c28.indd   297

298 
Search
 1. The growth of hidden data. Online but hidden databases (for example, 
an airline reservation system behind a search screen and ﬁ rewall) are 
known as the “deep Web.” Because they are hidden, search engine 
crawls discover only a tiny fraction of online information.11 Deep Web 
information is hidden for a reason, often because it is proprietary and 
a source of competitive advantage.12
 2. Generation of semantic metadata. Organizing information often relies 
on metadata, which is handled in two basic ways. In the top-down 
approach, semantics (systems of meaning) are built to coordinate 
data, especially for machine-to-machine transactions, such as ﬁ nancial 
transactions. These formal semantic maps, known as ontologies, tend 
to be extensive, labor intensive, and rigid. There are deﬁ nitely some 
circumstances in which they are essential; in other situations, ontolo-
gies can be little more than a nuisance, particularly if they are imple-
mented but not maintained.
Several ambitious efforts are under way to build a “seman-
tic Web,” utilizing semantics to power database-like Internet queries 
rather than text-string-based searches.13 George W. Bush attended 
Yale University and later was elected president of the United States. 
Asking “How many U.S. presidents attended Yale University?” of a 
search engine would not work, but querying a database of U.S. pres-
idents would be trivial. Freebase (which is now part of Google) is 
an attempt to organize information (such as the whole of Wikipedia) 
with sufﬁ cient disambiguation and classiﬁ cation to make queries pos-
sible. Other semantic Web efforts focus on scientiﬁ c publishing, situa-
tions in which a working vocabulary is potentially easier to deﬁ ne and 
organize.
 3. Human-assisted tagging. In contrast to ontologies imposed from the 
top down, tagging works from the bottom up. It is the practice of site 
visitors attaching metadata to an item, commonly a news story or a 
photo, based on a personal view. There is no effort made to reconcile 
conﬂ icting terminology; there are no authoritative answers. Instead, 
simple visualizations such as tag clouds (see Figure 28.1) show popu-
larity of various tags. In the absence of an abstract, tags work well for 
both image data and text as cost-effective ﬁ rst approximations: They 
do a “good enough” job of answering a simple question: What is this 
picture or blog post about?14
Finally, a major question for search in the future concerns “following 
the money:” How does the escalating competition between search engines 
questing for better results and largely invisible search engine optimization 
(SEO) providers affect how information is organized, found, and distrib-
uted? Before they founded Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page stated:

299
[From] historical experience with other media, we expect that 
advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased 
towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. 
Since it is very difﬁ cult even for experts to evaluate search engines, 
search engine bias is particularly insidious.15
Because search has become the organizing and access mechanism 
for the majority of online information, Google in particular is making sig-
niﬁ cant decisions behind the scenes as to what people can and cannot 
ﬁ nd easily, what is important, and what will be commercially valuable to 
Google. (See Figure 28.2.) The power that comes from “organizing the 
world’s information,” to quote Google’s mission statement, means that 
the company also has a disproportionate inﬂ uence on what the world 
knows. Algorithms may seem impersonal, but as we saw in Chapter 22, 
code is highly political. Google, Microsoft, and InterActive Corp (with Ask) 
both reﬂ ect and shape economic and cultural power with their results, 
and their users would be wise to bear economic motives in mind when 
reviewing the apparently objective results.16

Frontiers of Search
Text-string searching continues to get better, and mobility brings with 
it geographic facets of context sensitivity: Typing “pizza” in Tampa 
brings up nearby restaurants. Type-ahead or auto-ﬁ ll sometimes can 
shorten the process. Other innovations in search are making their 
way into commercialization:
 
 Video search, of both the images and the audio.
 
 Mobile search, which includes more precise geolocation input 
than is available from most PC searches.
 
 Queries, which build on structured data, as opposed to the free-
text nature of search engines. An example might be “tell me all 
books about roses written in German” or “list the winners of the 
Best-Actress Oscar who have children.”
 
 Social search, ﬁ nding things my friends liked.
 
 Natural-language questions and answers, which allow people (not 
machines) to ask and answer complex, nuanced questions: “what 
car should I buy?” or “where should I go on vacation?” Services 
including Quora have signiﬁ cant potential in this direction.
 
 Image search, which involves teaching computers to see the dif-
ference between a cat and a ﬁ sh without a human naming the

CHAPTER 29
Analytics
Thanks in part to vigorous efforts by vendors (led by IBM) to bring the idea to a wider 
public, analytics is coming closer to the mainstream. Whether in ESPN ads for fantasy 
football, or election-night slicing and dicing of vote and poll data, or the ever-broaden-
ing inﬂ uence of quantitative models for stock trading and portfolio development, num-
bers-driven decisions are no longer the exclusive province of people with hard-core 
quantitative skills backed by expensive, often proprietary infrastructure.
Not surprisingly, the deﬁ nition of “analytics” is completely prob-
lematic. At the simple end of the spectrum, one Australian ﬁ rm asserts 
that “[a]nalytics is basically using existing business data or statistics to 
make informed decisions.”1 Confronting market confusion, Gartner mar-
ket researchers settled on a similarly generic and less elegant assertion: 
“Analytics leverage data in a particular functional process (or application) 
to enable context-speciﬁ c insight that is actionable.”2
To avoid terminological conﬂ ict, let us merely assert that analytics uses 
statistical and other methods of processing to tease out business insights 
and decision cues from masses of data. In order to see the reach of these 
concepts and methods, consider a few examples drawn at random:
 
 The “ﬂ ash crash” of May 2010 focused attention on the many forms 
and roles of algorithmic trading of equities. While ﬁ rm numbers on the 
practice are difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd, it is telling that the regulated New York 
Stock Exchange has fallen from executing 80% of trades in its 
listed stocks to only 26% in 2010, according to Bloomberg.3 The major-
ity occurs in other trading venues, many of them essentially “lights-out” 
data centers; high-frequency trading ﬁ rms, employing a tiny percentage

Analytics
of the people associated with the stock markets, generate 60% of daily 
U.S. trading volume of roughly 10 billion shares.
 
 In part because of the broad inﬂ uence of Michael Lewis’s best-selling 
book Moneyball,4 quantitative performance analysis has moved from 
its formerly geeky niche at the periphery to become a central facet of 
many sports. MIT holds an annual conference on sports analytics that 
draws both sell-out crowds and A-list speakers. Statistics-driven fan-
tasy sports continue to rise in popularity all over the world as soccer, 
cricket, and rugby join the more familiar U.S. staples of football and 
baseball.
 
 Social network analysis, a lightly practiced subspecialty of sociology 
only two decades ago, has surged in popularity within the intelligence, 
marketing, and technology industries. Physics, biology, economics, and 
other disciplines all are contributing to the rapid growth of knowledge 
in this domain. Facebook, al Qaeda, and countless start-ups all require 
new ways of understanding cell phone, GPS, and friend-/kin-related 
trafﬁ c.
Why Now?
Perhaps as interesting as the range of its application are the many con-
verging reasons for the rise of interest in analytics. Here are ten, from per-
haps a multitude of others:
 1. Total quality management and six sigma programs trained a gener-
ation of production managers to value rigorous application of data. 
That six sigma has been misapplied and misinterpreted there can be 
little doubt, but the successes derived from a data-driven approach to 
decisions are informing today’s wider interest in statistically sophisti-
cated forms of analysis within the enterprise.
 2. Quantitative ﬁ nance applied ideas from operations research, phys-
ics, biology, supply chain management, and elsewhere to problems 
of money and markets. In a bit of turnabout, many data-intensive 
techniques, such as portfolio theory, are now migrating out of formal 
ﬁ nance into day-to-day management.
 3. As Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in August 2010, we now create in 
two days as much information as humanity did from the beginning of 
recorded history until 2003. That’s measuring in bits, obviously, and as 
such the estimate is skewed by the rise of high-resolution video, but 
the overall point is valid: People and organizations can create data far 
faster than any human being or process can assemble, digest, or act

on it. Cell phones, seen as both sensor and communication platforms, 
are a major contributor, as are enterprise systems and image genera-
tion. More of the world is instrumented, in increasingly standardized 
ways, than ever before: Bar codes and radio-frequency identiﬁ cation 
(RFID) tags on more and more items, Facebook status updates, GPS, 
and the ZigBee technical speciﬁ cation and other “Internet of things” 
efforts merely begin a list.
 4. Even as we as a species generate more data points than ever before, 
Moore’s law and its corollaries (such as Kryder’s law of hard discs, 
which have periods of intensive growth without the long-term stabil-
ity of microprocessor improvement5) are creating a computational fab-
ric which enables that data to be processed more cost-effectively than 
ever before. That processing, of course, creates still more data, com-
pounding the glut.
 5. After the reengineering/ERP push (which generated large quantities of 
actual rather than estimated operational data in the ﬁ rst place), after 
the Internet boom, and after the largely failed effort to make services-
oriented architectures a business development theme, technology 
vendors are putting major weight behind analytics. It sells services, 
hardware, and software; it can be used in every vertical segment; it 
applies to every size of business; and it connects to other macro-level 
phenomena: smart electrical grids, carbon footprints, healthcare cost 
containment, e-government, marketing efﬁ ciency, lean manufacturing, 
and so on. In short, many vendors have good reasons to emphasize 
analytics in their go-to-market efforts. Investments reinforce the com-
mitment: SAP’s purchase of Business Objects was its biggest acquisi-
tion ever, while IBM, Oracle, Microsoft, and Google have also spent 
billions buying capability in this area.
 6. Despite all the money spent on ERP, on data warehousing, and on 
“real-time” systems, most managers still cannot fully trust their data. 
Multiple spreadsheets document the same phenomena through dif-
ferent organizational lenses, data quality in enterprise systems incon-
sistently inspires conﬁ dence, and timeliness of results can vary 
widely, particularly in multinationals. Executives across industries 
have the same lament: For all of our systems and numbers, we often 
don’t have a ﬁ rm sense of what’s going on in our company and our 
markets.
 7. Related to this lack of conﬁ dence in enterprise data, risk awareness is on 
the rise in many sectors. Whether in product provenance (e.g., Mattel), 
recall management (Toyota, Cargill, or CVS), exposure to natural disas-
ters (Allstate, Chubb), credit and default risk (anyone), malpractice (any 
hospital), counterparty risk (Goldman Sachs), disaster management, or

Analytics
fraud (Enron, Satyam, Société Général, UBS), events of the past decade 
have sensitized executives and managers to the need for rigorous, data-
driven monitoring of complex situations.
 8. Data from across domains can be correlated through such ready iden-
tiﬁ ers as GPS location, credit reporting, cell phone number, or even 
Facebook identity. The “like” button, by itself, serves as a massive 
spur to interorganizational data analysis of consumer behavior at a 
scale never before available to sampling-driven marketing analyt-
ics. What happens when a “sample” population includes 100 million 
individuals?
 9. Visualization is improving. While the spreadsheet is ubiquitous in 
every organization and will remain so, the quality of information visu-
alization has improved over the past decade. This may result primarily 
from the law of large numbers (1% of a boatload is bigger than 1% 
of a handful), or it may reﬂ ect the growing inﬂ uence of a genera-
tion of skilled information designers, or it may be that such tools as 
Mathematica and Adobe Flex are empowering better number pictures, 
but in any event, the increasing quality of both the tools and the out-
puts of information visualization reinforces the larger trend toward 
sophisticated quantitative analysis.
 10. Software as a service (SaaS) can put analytics into the hands of people 
who lack the data sets, the computational processing power, and the 
rich technical training formerly required for hard-core number crunching.
Some examples follow.
Successes, Many Available as SaaS
 
 Financial charting and modeling continue to migrate down-market: 
Retail investors can now use Monte Carlo simulations and other tools 
well beyond the reach of individuals at the dawn of online investing 
in 1995 or thereabouts.
 
 Airline ticket prices at Microsoft’s Bing search engine are rated against 
a historical database, so purchasers of a particular route and date are 
told whether to buy now or wait.
 
 Customer segmentation can grow richer and more sure-footed as data 
quality and processing tools both improve. Bananas have, in recent 
years, been the biggest-selling item at Wal-Mart, for example, so their 
merchandising has evolved to reﬂ ect market basket analysis: Seeing 
that bananas and breakfast cereal often showed up together, the chain 
experimented with putting bananas (as well as other items) in mul-
tiple locations—adding a display in the cereal aisle, for example.
 
 Wolfram Alpha (Figure 29.1) is taking a search-engine approach to 
calculated results: A stock’s price/earnings ratio is readily presented

on a historical chart, for example. Scientiﬁ c calculations currently are 
handled more readily than natural-language queries, but the tool’s 
potential is unbelievable.
 
 Google Analytics brings marketing tools formerly unavailable any-
where to the owner of the smallest business: Anyone can slice and 
dice ad- and revenue-related data from dozens of angles, as long as 
they relate to the search engine in some way.
 
 Fraud detection through automated, quantitative tools holds great 
appeal because of both labor savings and rapid payback. Health and 
auto insurers, telecom carriers, and ﬁ nancial institutions are investing 
heavily in these technologies.
Practical Considerations: Why Analytics Is Still Hard
For all the tools, all the data, and all the computing power, getting num-
bers to tell stories is still difﬁ cult. There are a variety of reasons for the 
current state of affairs.
First, organizational realities mean that different entities collect data 
for their own purposes, label and format it in often-nonstandard ways, 
and hold it locally, usually in Excel but also in e-mails, or pdfs, or produc-
tion systems. Data synchronization efforts can be among the most difﬁ cult 
of a chief information ofﬁ cer’s tasks, with uncertain payback. Managers in 
separate but related silos may ask the same question using different termi-
nology or see a cross-functional issue through only one lens.
Second, skills are not yet adequately distributed. Database analysts 
can type SQL* queries but usually don’t have the managerial instincts or 
experience to probe the root cause of a business phenomenon. Statistical 
numeracy, often at a high level, remains a requirement for many analytics 
efforts; knowing the right tool for a given data type, or business event, or 
time scale takes experience, even assuming a clean data set. For example, 
correlation does not imply causation, as every ﬁ rst-year statistics student 
*Structured Query Language is the language of database interrogation: An example 
would be

SET a.[updated_column] = updatevalue

knows, yet temptations to let it do so abound, especially as electronic sce-
narios outrun human understanding of ground truths.
Third, odd as it sounds in an age of assumed infoglut, getting the 
right data can be a challenge. Especially in extended enterprises but 
also in extrafunctional processes, measures are rarely sufﬁ ciently consis-
tent, sufﬁ ciently rich, or sufﬁ ciently current to support robust analytics. 
Importing data to explain outside factors adds layers of cost, complexity, 
and uncertainty: Weather, credit, customer behavior, and other exogenous 
factors can be critically important to either long-term success or day-to-
day operations, yet representing these phenomena in a data-driven model 
can pose substantial challenges. Finally, many forms of data do not read-
ily plug into the available processing tools: Unstructured data, such as 
e-mails or text messages, is growing at a rapid rate, adding to the com-
plexity of analysis.
Fourth, data often relates to people, and people may not willingly 
give it up. Loyalty-club bar codes have been shared (often by cashiers), 
smart electrical metering is being viewed as a privacy invasion in some 
quarters,6 and tools for online privacy (cookie blockers, adware removers, 
etc.) are increasingly popular.
In certain situations, the algorithmic sensemaking available in com-
mon analytical tools is useful in uncovering and providing relevant infor-
mation, wherever it may have originated. The cost and availability of such 
information are improving: In oil and gas, for example, information tech-
nology has helped drop the cost of a three-dimensional seismic map of 
the subsurface from $8 million per square kilometer in 1980, to $1 million 
in 1990, to $90,000 in 2005. But even the best analytics cannot reliably 
replace the human intelligence needed to draw the right conclusions from 
the information. Furthermore, not every quantitative question has a calcu-
lable answer.
Looking Ahead
Getting numbers to tell stories requires the ability to ask the right ques-
tion of the data, assuming the data is clean and trustworthy in the ﬁ rst 
place. This unique skill requires a blend of process knowledge, statis-
tical numeracy, time, narrative facility, and both rigor and creativity in 
proper proportion. Not surprisingly, such managers are not technicians 
and are difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd in many workplaces. For the promise of ana-
lytics to match what it actually delivers, the biggest breakthroughs will 
likely come in education and training rather than algorithms or database 
technology.

CHAPTER 30
Information Visualization
Because it is now easier to create visually pleasing graphics, because there is so much 
data to manage and understand, and because tools such as spreadsheets have ﬁ nite 
limits in their ability to convey meaning, information visualization is a rich area, par-
ticularly linked as it usually is with ideas of information analytics. The ultimate chal-
lenge is less technical than cognitive: What is the creator trying to say, and what can 
he or she assume the reader will bring to the task of understanding both the data and 
its representation?
Over the past 30 years or so, the ﬁ eld of information visualization 
has evolved rapidly. Several factors help explain this development: sup-
ply, demand, and the audience. Today, each of these elements is changing 
rapidly, with broad consequences.
Supply
Both the quantity of information that needs to be processed (at both 
human and organizational levels) and the quality of the tools for manag-
ing and displaying it are increasing. To process this information, human-
ity makes increasing use of larger and higher-resolution displays as well 
as faster computing in devices not technically called computers: Sony 
PlayStations are wonders of graphics processing, for example.
Demand
More and more processes are being driven by digital information. Text 
and numbers gave way to pictures and sounds, then to video, and now

Information Visualization
to three dimensions. Where sailors once relied on stars and sun to navi-
gate, differential GPS deliver resolution to a few meters nearly anywhere 
on earth.
Audience
With the numbers of people accessing Internet and other information 
growing rapidly, translation into countless languages is often difﬁ cult. 
Visual displays, while not culturally universal, can help bridge across audi-
ences that may be divided by language. Audiences are also expecting 
information in visual forms. In the United States, such expectations were 
traditionally set with election-night reporting; network news organizations 
often revealed new quantitative tricks to help hold audiences.
Deﬁ nition and Purpose
For our purposes, a simple deﬁ nition of visualization should sufﬁ ce: “the 
use of computer-supported, interactive visual representations of data 
to amplify cognition.”1 “Cognition” is a word with its own deﬁ nitional 
issues: Do I want information to enlighten me about something I did not 
know (much in the manner of USA Today’s random daily graphics), to 
answer a question I already have, or to provide context for some future 
action? The need is acute: According to a 2006 Harris survey, 75% of 
respondents said they had made a ﬂ awed business decision because 
of ﬂ awed data.2
Different visualizations serve different purposes. In the 1980s and 
1990s, for example, graphics workstations were widely deployed in televi-
sion studios as an arms race of weather-casting helped advance the state 
of the ﬁ eld. The weather people can boast results: Many more people can 
understand a Doppler radar image than can grasp binomial distributions, 
bid-ask spreads, or genetic mutations. As we shall see, geospatial informa-
tion can bring with it built-in tools for understanding: Many people can 
ﬁ nd north on a map, while other cultures have yet to invent the concept 
of a map at all.
Historically, many visualizations have resulted from individuals who 
wanted to change their world: Florence Nightingale’s striking maps relat-
ing conditions in military hospitals after the Crimean War helped persuade 
Queen Victoria to initiate broad reforms in public sanitation. More recently, 
the tools built by Hans Rosling and his colleagues at Gapminder are clearly 
aimed at increasing public awareness of international  economics and other

social issues. His visualizations have made this Swedish public health 
expert an Internet celebrity based on his TED*  videos.3
Implicitly or explicitly, all visualizations answer roughly the same set 
of questions:
 
 How are similarity and difference conveyed?
 
 Is time static, as in a pie chart, or dynamic, as in many line graphs or 
slider-bar tools?
 
 How much granularity is sacriﬁ ced for “glanceability,” and how much 
does comprehension require investments of time and skill to deliver 
details?
 
 Is causality intended to be conveyed? Can it be unreasonably inferred?
 
 How does space function in the representation? Do proportions relate 
to some ground truth?
 
 What do the colors convey? Are colors used in standard (green =  proceed 
safely; red = danger) or nonstandard ways?
 
 How are the reliability, timeliness, accuracy, precision, and other attri-
butes of the underlying data represented in the visualization?4
 
 Computer visualizations, unlike paper ones, can be interactive. How 
easily can users learn to reposition, zoom in, reset a baseline, and oth-
erwise get the visualization to respond to their actions?
 
 How likely is ambiguity? Why might the display be read three differ-
ent ways by three different people?
 
 Independent of the graphical tool(s) chosen, does the visualization 
ask appropriate questions of the data?
Current State
There’s no shortage of activity in the ﬁ eld of information visualization, 
samples of which can be experienced at Flex.org, VisualComplexity.com, 
or IBM’s Many Eyes. Some work is truly stunning, and global centers of 
design leadership are emerging. Even so, the fundamental tension quickly 
becomes evident: Words like “galleries” suggest that we are viewing works 
of art, and in many instances the work should be in museums. But art 
by deﬁ nition is unique; visualization has yet to be brought to the masses 
of managers, citizens, and students who have something to say but lack

Information Visualization
the tools, grammar, and training to create the beautiful. In short, the task 
of helping high levels of information visualization migrate from the artist 
to the worker remains unaccomplished. Three categories of work can be 
broadly identiﬁ ed: business intelligence tools, physical data visualization, 
and nonspatial data.
Business Intelligence Tools
As part of an ongoing trend toward consolidation of the enterprise appli-
cation software market, visualization vendors have been incorporated 
into broader package or service offerings. In 2007, for example, Oracle 
bought Hyperion, IBM acquired Cognos, and SAP bought Business 
Objects. Combined with a strong offering from Microsoft, these players 
dominate the market, leaving only SAS and MicroStrategy as leading stand-
alone contenders. Business intelligence (BI) software, while not particu-
larly expensive or difﬁ cult to use, sometimes requires extensive cleanup 
work on the data to be analyzed. Between standardization on format 
and nomenclature, explication of assumptions across operating units, and 
shared storage and access at the enterprise level, the data warehousing 
and data mining components of a BI effort can run into millions of dollars 
before a single report is generated.
Executive dashboards have become common, but as noted visualiza-
tion pioneer Edward Tufte notes, the metaphor itself introduces issues, as 
do words like “cockpit” or “command center.” As Tufte wrote in 2003, 
three basic questions must be addressed:
1. What are the intellectual problems that the displays are sup-
posed to help with? The point of information displays is to assist 
thinking; therefore, ask ﬁ rst of all: What are the thinking tasks 
that the displays are supposed to help with?
2. How much can I trust the underlying information? It is essential 
to build systematic checks of data quality into the display and 
analysis system. For example, good checks of the data on rev-
enue recognition must be made, given the strong incentives for 
premature recognition. Beware, in management data, of what 
statisticians call “sampling to please”—selecting, sorting, fudg-
ing, choosing data so as to please management.
3. What is the underlying business or other process I am managing? 
For information displays for management, avoid heavy- breathing 
metaphors, such as the mission control center, the strategic air 
command, the cockpit, the dashboard, or Star Trek. As Peter 
Drucker once said, good management is boring. If you want 
excitement, don’t go to a good management information system.5

Physical Data Visualization
In 1931, Alfred Korzybski, a little-known philosopher, stated that “the map 
is not the territory.”6 Visualizations of physical phenomena are by deﬁ -
nition abstractions, which means that interpretation, selection, and repre-
sentation issues confront both makers and viewers of these visualizations. 
Compared to nonphysical phenomena, such as beliefs and risk, physical 
data is more straightforward, but signiﬁ cant considerations still inform the 
craft of visualization in the physical domain.
A tangible example is provided by Harry Beck’s classical visualization 
of the London Underground ﬁ rst completed in 1931 and revised thereaf-
ter.7 Compared to the predecessor map, which is unremarkable, Beck’s 
elegant abstraction was much more readable. It does suffer, however, 
from factual errors: Stations on different lines that are only a few hundred 
meters apart are shown as far away, leading riders to make two trans-
fers and walk down long tunnels when, had they been aboveground, they 
could have seen how physically close the stations were.
Beck was an electrical draftsman by training, so the convention of a 
grid, allowing only 90- and 45-degree angles, was familiar to him from cir-
cuit diagrams. This artiﬁ ce largely eliminated topography from the design 
brief, enabling him to concentrate instead on relative location along a 
given line: Distances between stations on different lines are often vastly 
out of proportion. Other key elements of the map’s success—use of white 
space, color-based simpliﬁ cation, and modern design cues, including 
typography and limited symbolism—came from Frank Pick, the design-
minded head of publicity for the London Underground. Weighing the 
importance of usability for the task at hand against the physical reality 
being represented is a key step, and the importance of Beck’s contribu-
tion, as well as its limitations, is reﬂ ected in London Transport’s decision 
to call the aid not a map but a Journey Planner.
Nonspatial Data
The task of conceptual data visualization is particularly difﬁ cult because 
good displays must create spatial representations of nonspatial data. While 
the concept of geographic information displays is relatively straightforward 
(using one or more variations of a map and presenting overlaid informa-
tion on it), representation of nonspatial data can be more challenging. 
This is not new: Linear representations have conveyed time for millennia, 
and pie charts have become handy shorthand for subsets of a whole. Good 
maps remain the gold standard but enjoy the advantage of being a spa-
tial representation of space rather than something less tangible. Consult a 
UK Ordnance Survey map or a ﬁ ne nineteenth-century sample from any

number of countries, and compare the quality to the nonspatial representa-
tions we encounter every day: USA Today visuals, executive dashboards, 
or owner’s manuals. In most cases, the antique remains superior to the 
modern.
A powerful visualization known as a tree map has proven very useful 
for nonphysical data. Smart Money’s Map of the Market,8 which visualizes 
daily stock market performance, is probably the best-known tree map. 
Information domains are formed of rectangles, each of which includes 
component entities, sized proportionately to population, market capitaliza-
tion, risk, or other variables and available for inspection by mouse roll-
over. The visualization provides at-a-glance awareness of the state of the 
entire domain, a given sector, or individual components.
As the ﬁ eld evolves, information architects are challenged to create 
readable, repeatable conventions for such abstractions as risk, intellec-
tual property (patents are a poor proxy for human capital, for example), 
and attitudinal information, such as customer satisfaction or conﬁ dence 
in government. Search and visualization have much to offer each other: 
Semiarbitrary lists of text-string matches remain hard to make visual. 
(Concepts are notoriously difﬁ cult to map spatially, in contrast to the ele-
gance of the periodic table of the elements, to take a classic example.) 
Static social network maps, especially those of large social graphs, such 
as Facebook, quickly grow useless at their enormous scale. Attempting to 
show a dynamic social network using a graph (e.g., showing individuals 
as nodes in a two-dimensional graph and social interconnections as links 
between nodes) is a common representation but may not be satisfying 
because of limitations in showing the character of the social links (e.g., 
type of connection, strength, duration, interactions among multiple peo-
ple, etc.) and other factors.
Looking Ahead
Some precedents may be useful. The history of sailing and shipping is 
rich with examples of various parties agreeing on conventions (port and 
starboard do not vary in different countries the way rules for automobiles 
do) and solving problems of conveying information. Shipping contain-
ers interlock regardless of carrier while being handled at countless global 
ports.9 The Beaufort wind scale arose from the need for agreed-on met-
rics for measuring wind aboard a ship, a matter of great practical impor-
tance. Even today, with satellites and computerized navigation systems, a 
Beaufort 0 (“Calm; smoke rises vertically”) is the same around the world, 
while a 12 (“Air ﬁ lled with foam; sea completely white with driving spray;

visibility greatly reduced”) spells disaster no matter how fast the hurricane 
winds are actually blowing.10
Musical notation presents another relevant example. Easily transport-
able, relatively impervious to language, and yet a representation (rather 
than a reproduction) of a performance, scores have the kinds of conven-
tions that information visualization for the most part still lacks. At this 
point, good visualizations are featured in “galleries”—as beﬁ t works of art. 
They are created by artists and artisans, not by people who merely have 
something to say. At the risk of a strained analogy, we are at the stage 
where latter-day monks painstakingly hand-letter sacred texts, still await-
ing both Gutenberg and the typewriter.
In his book Envisioning Information, Tufte suggests ﬁ ve tactics for 
increasing information density and “escaping ﬂ atland”—conveying more 
than two dimensions of meaning on paper. These are:
 1. Micro/macro readings (relating both wholes and parts as distinct 
entities)
 2. Layering and separation (often by use of color and graphic weight, as 
in a technical drawing)
 3. Small multiples (to show often-subtle differences within elements of a 
system: A good lunar chart is an example)
 4. Color and information (sensitivity to the palette as color labels, mea-
sures, represents reality, and enlivens)
 5. Narratives of space and time (compressing the most powerful human 
dimensions onto ﬂ atland).11
For all of the wisdom in these suggestions and the beauty of Tufte’s 
examples—it’s no accident that he’s both a statistician and a working 
 artist—good information visualizations remain rare. For information to 
convey meaning in standard, predictable ways, we need tools: “tools” as 
in grammars and lexicons rather than more widgets. Somewhat paradoxi-
cally, the path to better visualizations will be paved not with software but 
with words.

CHAPTER 31
Identity and Privacy
As people’s identities migrate into the ether of digital representation, all manner of 
questions emerge: Rights, responsibilities, and risks all can be thought of in signiﬁ -
cantly different terms than they were 20 years ago.
With the launch of Google Plus in 2011, it’s an opportune time to think 
about digital privacy, insofar as Google is explicitly targeting widespread 
user dissatisfaction with Facebook’s treatment of their personal information. 
The tagging feature, for example, that was used to build a massive (hun-
dreds of millions of users) facial recognition database has important pri-
vacy implications. In standard Facebook fashion, it’s turned on by default, 
and opting out once may not guarantee that a user is excluded from the 
next wave of changes. If a government did that, controversy would likely 
be intense, but in Facebook’s case, people seem to be resigned to the 
behavior.
According to a 2010 poll of customer satisfaction developed at the 
University of Michigan, Facebook scored in the bottom 5% of providers—in 
the range of cable operators, airlines, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
Even as Facebook is rumored to be holding off user-base announcements 
for 100-million intervals since a billion is in range, users are defecting. 
While the service is said to be closing in on 750 million users globally, 
reports of 1% of that population in the United States and Canada defecting 
in one month were not conﬁ rmed by the company, but neither were they 
denied. A Google search on “Facebook fatigue” returned nearly 100,000 
hits. At the same time, Facebook delivers 31% of the 1.1 trillion ads served 
in the United States each quarter (Yahoo! is a distant second at 10% share); 
those ads are expected to represent $4 billion in 2011 revenue.1

Identity and Privacy
Privacy
With the Facebook initial public offering still pending, the questions about 
privacy take on more urgency as the ﬁ rm is being scrutinized. What, really, 
is privacy? It’s clearly a fundamental concept, typically conceived of as a 
human or civil right. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), 
privacy is “the state or condition of being alone, undisturbed, or free from 
public attention, as a matter of choice or right; seclusion; freedom from inter-
ference or intrusion.” It’s an old word, dating to the fourteenth century, that is 
constantly being reinvented as times change.
Being left alone in a digital world is a difﬁ cult concept, however, given 
the sheer number of connections. Here, New York University’s Helen 
Nissenbaum is helpful: “What people care most about is not simply restrict-
ing the ﬂ ow of information but ensuring that it ﬂ ows appropriately.”2 Thus, 
she does not wade further into the deﬁ nitional swamp but spends a book’s 
worth of analysis on the issue of how people interact with the structures 
that collect, parse, and move their information.
Through this lens, the listed artifacts cannot be judged as public or pri-
vate, good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable, but they can be discussed 
and considered in the context of people’s values, choices, and autonomy: 
When I use X, is my information handled in a way that I consent to in some 
reasonably informed way? The digital privacy landscape is vast, including 
some familiar tools, and for all the privacy notices I have received, there is a 
lot I don’t know about the workings of most of these:
 
 Loyalty card programs
 
 Google streetview
 
 Toll-pass radio-frequency identiﬁ cation (RFID) tags
 
 Surveillance cameras
 
 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) no-ﬂ y lists
 
 Facebook data and actions
 
 Credit-rating data
 
 Amazon browsing and purchase history
 
 Google search history
 
 Foursquare check-ins
 
 Digital camera metadata
 
 Expressed preferences, such as star ratings, Facebook “likes,” or eBay 
seller feedback
 
 Searchable digital public records, such as court dates, house pur-
chases, or bankruptcy
 
 Cell phone location and connection records
 
 Medical records, electronic or paper
 
 Gmail correspondence

323
 
 TSA backscatter X-ray
 
 Item-level billing systems, as used at telecom ﬁ rms and many others
Does such lack of knowledge mean that I have conceded privacy or 
that I am exposing aspects of my life I would rather not? Probably both. 
In addition, the perfection of digital memory—handled properly, bits don’t 
degrade with repeated copying—means that what these entities know, 
they know for a very long time. The combination, therefore, of lack of 
popular understanding of the mechanics of personal information and the 
permanence of that information makes privacy doubly suspect.
Scale
Given the climate of the past 10 years in relation to privacy, the events 
of 9/11 have conditioned the debate to an extraordinary degree. The U.S. 
government was reorganized, search and seizure rules were broadened, 
and rules of the game got more complicated: Not only were certain enti-
ties ordered to turn over information related to their customers, they were 
legally obligated to deny that they had done so. More centrally, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation’s well-documented failure to connect the dots 
spurred a reorganization of multiple information silos into a vast and pos-
sibly suboptimally sprawling Department of Homeland Security.
Governments have always wanted more information than people typi-
cally want to give them. Given the new legal climate along with improve-
ments in the technologies of databases, information retrieval, and image 
processing, for example, more is known about U.S. individuals than at any 
time heretofore. (Whether it is known by the proper people and agen-
cies is a separate question.) At the 2000 Super Bowl, for example, the 
entire crowd was scanned and matched against an image database. Note 
the rhetoric employed even before the terrorist attack on the twin towers 
and the Pentagon:
[Tampa detective Bill] Todd is excited about the biometric 
crimestopper aid: The facial recognition technology is an 
extremely fast, technologically advanced version of placing a cop 
on a corner, giving him a face book of criminals and saying, Pick 
the criminals out of the crowd and detain them. It’s just very fast 
and accurate.3
Note that the category of “criminals” can be conveniently deﬁ ned: the 
deﬁ nition in Yemen, Libya, or Pakistan might be debatable, depending on

one’s perspective. In Tampa, civil liberties were not explicitly addressed, 
nor was there judicial oversight:
Concerned ﬁ rst and foremost with public safety, the Tampa police 
used its judgment in viewing the images brought up on the monitor. 
Although the cameras permitted the police to view crimes captured 
by the cameras and apprehend suspects for pick-pocketing and 
other petty crimes, their real goal was to ensure crowd safety. The 
Tampa police were involved in forming the database and deter-
mining by threat level who was added to the database. (Emphasis 
added.)
Letting a police force, which in any given locality may have corrup-
tion issues, as in large areas of Mexico, use digital records to ﬁ guratively 
stand on a corner and pick “the criminals out of the crowd” without prob-
able cause is scary stuff. Also in the news, a major story concerns an FBI 
agent who protected his informant (Whitey Bulger) from murder charges. 
And police ofﬁ cers might not be corrupt: Mexican drug gangs are now 
being said to threaten U.S. law enforcement ofﬁ cers with harm. Once the 
information and the technology exist, they will be abused: The issue is 
how to design safeguards into the process.
Consider RFID toll passes. According to a transportation industry 
trade journal, the ﬁ rst instance of electronic toll record tracking may have 
occurred in September 1997,
when the New York City Police Department used E-Z Pass toll 
records to track the movements of a car owned by New Jersey 
millionaire Nelson G. Gross who had been abducted and mur-
dered. The police did not use a subpoena to obtain these records 
but asked the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and they 
complied.4
Again, the potential for privacy abuse emerged before protections did. 
In 2010, there were nearly 21 million E-ZPass transponders in use, roughly 
half of the U.S. total number of toll passes: They were read about 2.4 bil-
lion times.5 As only one in a number of highly revealing artifacts attached 
to a person’s digital identity, toll tokens join a growing number of sen-
sors of which few people are aware. The on-board diagnostics system in a 
car, expanded from a mechanic’s engine diagnostic, has become a “black 
box” like those recovered from airplane crashes. Progressive Insurance is 
experimenting with data logging from the devices as a premium-setting 
tool. Signiﬁ cantly, its tool does not include GPS information; the ﬁ rm dis-
continued a GPS-based experiment in 2000.

Invisibility
In its excellent “What They Know” investigative series in 2010, the 
Wall Street Journal concluded that “they” know a lot. Numbers only 
scratch the surface of the issues:
 
 Dictionary.com installed 234 tracking cookies into a browser in a sin-
gle visit. WSJ.com itself came in below average, at 60. Wikipedia.org 
was the only site of 50 tested to install zero tracking software ﬁ les.
 
 When Microsoft relaunched Internet Explorer in 2008, corporate inter-
ests concerned about ad revenue vetoed a plan to make privacy set-
tings persistent. Thus, users have to reset the privacy preferences with 
every browser restart, and few people are aware of the settings con-
sole in the ﬁ rst place.
 
 The Facebook “like” button connects a behavior (an online vote, a 
pursuit of a coupon, or an act of whim) to a ﬂ esh-and-blood person: 
The Facebook proﬁ le’s presumably real name, real age, real sex, and 
real location. Again according to the Journal:
 
For example, Facebook or Twitter know when one of their mem-
bers reads an article about ﬁ ling for bankruptcy on MSNBC.com 
or goes to a blog about depression called Fighting the Darkness, 
even if the user doesn’t click the “Like” or “Tweet” buttons on 
those sites. For this to work, a person only needs to have logged 
into Facebook or Twitter once in the past month. The sites will 
continue to collect browsing data, even if the person closes their 
browser or turns off their computers, until that person explicitly 
logs out of their Facebook or Twitter accounts, the study found.6
 
 Few people realize how technologies can be used to follow them 
from one realm to another. The giant advertising ﬁ rm WPP recently 
launched Xaxis, which, according to the Wall Street Journal (in a story 
separate from its “What They Know” series),
 
will manage what it describes as the “world’s largest” database 
of proﬁ les of individuals that includes demographic, ﬁ nancial, 
purchase, geographic and other information collected from their 
Web activities and brick-and-mortar transactions. The database 
will be used to personalize ads consumers see on the Web, social-
networking sites, mobile phones and ultimately, the TV set.7

recognition software, large cloud computing databases, and readily

available social networking data to identify strangers and gain their 
personal information. According to the lead researcher, “When we 
share tagged photos of ourselves online, it becomes possible for oth-
ers to link our face to our names in situations where we would nor-
mally expect anonymity.”8 Given that none of these technologies is 
particularly difﬁ cult to obtain, the results suggest that anonymity might 
be a soon-to-be obsolete notion.
In each of these examples, it’s pretty clear that all of these compa-
nies ignored, or at least lightly valued, Nissenbaum’s notion of contextual 
integrity as it relates to the individual. Given the lack of tangible conse-
quences, it makes economic sense for them to do so.
Identity
Given that digital privacy seems almost to be a quaint notion in the 
United States (Europeans live and are legally protected differently), a 
deeper question emerges: If that OED sense of freedom from intrusion 
is being reshaped by our many digital identities, who are we and what 
do we control? Ads, spam, nearly continuous interruption (if we let our-
selves listen), and an often-creepy sense of “how did they know that?” 
as LinkedIn, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netﬂ ix hone in our most 
cherished idiosyncrasies—all of these are embedded in the contemporary 
connected culture. Many sites, such as Lifehacker, recommend frequent 
pruning: E-mail offers, coupon sites, Twitter feeds, and Facebook friends 
can multiply out of control, and saying no often requires more delibera-
tion than does joining up.
Who am I? Not to get metaphysical, but the context for that question 
is in ﬂ ux. My ﬁ fth-grade teacher was fond of saying “Tell me who your 
friends are and I’ll tell you who you are.” What would he say to today’s 
ﬁ fth grader, who may well text 8,000 times a month and have a public 
Facebook page?
Does it matter that a person’s political alignment, sexual orienta-
tion, religious afﬁ liation, and zip code (a reasonable proxy for household 
income) are often now a matter of public, searchable record? Is her identity 
different now that some many facets of it are transparent? Or is it a matter 
of Mark Zuckerberg’s vision—people have one identity, and transparency 
is good for relationships—being implicitly shared more widely across the 
planet? Some reviews of Google Plus argued that people don’t mind having 
one big list of “friends,” even as Facebook scored poorly in customer satis-
faction indexes year after year.

327
Indeed, one solution to the privacy dilemma is to overshare: If noth-
ing can possibly be held close, secrets lose their potency, perhaps. (For an 
example, see the story of Hasan Elahi and his Tracking Transience Web site 
in the May 2007 issue of Wired magazine and in Albert-László Barabási’s 
book Bursts.) The recent spread of YouTube pregnancy-test videos is fas-
cinating: One of life’s most meaningful, trajectory-altering moments is 
increasingly an occasion to show the world the heavy (water) drinking, 
the trips to the pharmacy and the toilet, and the little colored indicator, fol-
lowed by the requisite reaction shots. (For more, see Marisa Meltzer’s piece 
on Slate, wonderfully titled “WombTube.”9)
The other extreme, opting out, is difﬁ cult. Living without a mobile 
phone, without electronic books, without MP3 music ﬁ les, without e-mail, 
and of course without Facebook or Google is difﬁ cult for many to com-
prehend. In fact, the decision to unplug (usually temporarily) frequently 
goes hand in hand with a book project about “My Six Months Ofﬂ ine,” so 
unheard-of is the notion.
At the same time, the primacy of the word represented by these mas-
sive information ﬂ ows leaves out at least 10% of the adult U.S. population: 
Functional illiteracy, by its very nature, is difﬁ cult to measure. One shocking 
statistic, presented without attribution by the Detroit Literacy Coalition, pegs 
the number in that metro area at a stunning 47%. Given a core population 
of about 4 million in the three-county area, that’s well over 1 million adults 
who have few concerns with Twitter feeds, Google searches, or allocating 
their 401(k) portfolio.
Looking Ahead
Between the extremes of oversharing and opting out, where most 
Americans now live, there’s an abundance of gray area. As “what they 
know,” in the Journal’s words, grows and what they can do with it 
expands, perhaps the erosion of analog notions of privacy will be steady 
but substantial. Another possibility is some high-proﬁ le, disproportionately 
captivating event that galvanizes reaction. The fastest adoption of a tech-
nology in modern times is not GPS, or DVD, or even Facebook: It was the 
U.S. government’s Do Not Call registry. Engineering privacy into browsers, 
cell phones, and very large data stores is unlikely; litigation is, unfortu-
nately, a more likely outcome: In 2011, a U.S. federal judge refused to halt 
a class-action suit against Google’s practice of using its Street View cars 
for Wi-Fi snifﬁ ng. The story of privacy, while old, is entering a fascinating, 
and exasperating, new phase, and much remains to be learned, tested, 
and accepted as normal.

Identity and Privacy
Are Private Planes Private?
Every aircraft has a unique tail number that identiﬁ es the hardware, the 
owner, the manufacturer, and other registration information. A number 
of ﬂ ight-tracking Web sites, such as FlightAware, have emerged, allow-
ing anyone to type in a tail number, ﬁ nd the current location of the 
plane, and see who owns it. (At least one tail number is used as a 
branding opportunity, even though no logo appears on the Gulfstream 
G-V: N1KE.)
People who own or ﬂ y private planes were given the opportu-
nity to block their registration from being used for tracking purposes. 
Some owners claimed competitive reasons: Negotiations to acquire a 
company could quickly become public if corporate jets were found 
traveling to the target’s headquarters. Paparazzi clearly could use the 
data for their purposes. Others claimed that the safety of the passen-
gers depended on privacy.
In 2011, the Wall Street Journal built a database of corporate 
planes.10 Shareholders in public companies could see the beneﬁ t to 
executives who may not have broken out the jet in compensation 
ﬁ gures, particularly when the destinations were not business related. 
Nonshareholders could indulge their curiosity: It is simple to see the 
destinations included in the travels of the Bombardier BD-700 Global 
Express, tail number N54SL, registered to Harpo, Inc., more readily 
identiﬁ ed with Oprah Winfrey.
In 2008, the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA), a lob-
bying group of business aircraft users, ﬁ led suit to have the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) block tail-number information if the 
owner so requested. A court ruled against the NBAA in 2010, and, 
in 2011, the FAA declared it would shut down the blocking program. 
According to Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, “This action is 
in keeping with the Obama administration’s commitment to transpar-
ency in government. Both general aviation and commercial aircraft use 
the public airspace and air trafﬁ c control facilities, and the public has 
a right to information about their activities.”11 Preliminary indications 
were that operators who could show a “veriﬁ able threat,” including 
death threats or kidnapping, would qualify for the blocking, but ﬁ nal 
rules have yet to appear and some information remains blocked.

CHAPTER 32
Communications 
and Relationships
It’s reasonably obvious that the state of a society’s communications tools will shape 
the size, nature, and intensity of potential interpersonal relationships within that soci-
ety, and vice versa. Cave painting, orally  transmitted legends, tabloid newspapers, 
and telephones each support different kinds of social networks. Smartphones and the 
Internet are no different: The changing state of our tools is altering how we relate, and 
new ways of relating feed back into the evolution of the tool sets. Those evolving rela-
tionships have implications for work: Is your boss your Facebook friend? What do you 
do when a coworker’s proﬁ le appears on Match.com? These new relationship patterns 
are shifting the nature of entrepreneurship: Why build a physical widget when you 
can write an app? Finally, there are huge commercial questions: Will Apple, Facebook, 
Google, or some other entity proﬁ t from being the same kind of force AT&T was in the 
heyday of the telephone as the dominant communications platform?
Three layers of the relationship questions merit attention. First, we 
consider the changing nature of our connections. Second, we examine what 
kinds of networks emerge from those connections. Finally, we see what cre-
ative possibilities emerge from the changes in the ways we relate and com-
municate with each other.
Connections
People of a certain age will remember what it was like to have two phone 
numbers, one for the workplace and one for home. If you were near 
one of them, you could be reached; if not, you might be hard to ﬁ nd. In

Communications and Relationships 
some ways, the mobile phone simpliﬁ es matters: If a voice connection is 
desired, one number follows you 24 hours a day, across oceans, in some 
tunnels, in national parks and crowded urban canyons. But what if one 
doesn’t want to be reached for soccer league purposes during preparation 
for an important meeting? What are the limits of when a coworker can call 
on the weekend? One number for everything forces such issues out of the 
infrastructure into the realm of interpersonal rules of engagement.
But for more and more people, a voice-to-voice connection is not nec-
essarily the objective. A picture may be important or merely entertaining 
but has capabilities of its own. Skype makes video calling cheap and easy; 
so does Apple’s iChat, but each requires a bit of setup and coordination. 
Text messaging has soared in popularity in the United States in less than a 
decade. Maybe a Facebook message, or a Google chat, or a Twitter direct 
message is the right tool for the job.
Given so much multitasking, not even counting “productivity” appli-
cations such as Word or Excel, it’s hard not to wonder about distracted-
ness. In the early years of the Internet boom, Linda Stone, who at the 
time was at Microsoft, saw multitasking as “continuous partial attention:” 
People were sort-of tuned in to multiple windows, maybe earphones, and 
perhaps a television nearby.1 Now that people can interact with others 
so quickly and at such scale, at least one blogger has raised the issue of 
“continuous partial affection,” the notion that we can be sort-of connected 
to a whole bunch of people but not really attend on an emotional level.2
Multimedia, especially on the move, deserves attention: As we saw in 
relation to innovation, being able to see techniques, read facial and other 
physical cues, or situate a person or group in physical context enriches the 
conversation. Putting a teleconference rig on a simple robot changes 
the dynamic of a remote meeting: The outsider can inject nuance, follow the 
conversation into the hallways or to the lunch table, and generally be more 
present.3 The tagline at YouTube, meanwhile, reads “Broadcast Yourself.” 
The implications of hundreds of millions of people doing just that have yet 
to be fully plumbed, but the transition from wireline voice to mobile multi-
media is happening extremely fast. Just what will change as a result will be 
fascinating to see—literally.
Thus, the ﬁ rst problem is determining what kind of interaction I 
want to initiate. Then I need to think of the recipient’s patterns, and then 
the identity problem enters in: Facebook simpliﬁ es this by using a real 
name, but it’s common for a single individual to have multiple phone 
numbers, aliases, avatars, and other naming conventions. Many of us are 
in a similar position to the Bell system’s “telephone ladies,” the young 
women who patched callers together at early-twentieth-century switch-
boards. Particularly at work, when colleagues of different generations are

involved, the task of management is complicated by the multiplicity of 
platforms, each with ill-deﬁ ned conventions for its use.
In a world of so many connections, everybody is on some information 
grid, whether in a spy satellite’s photo, a digitally facilitated social network, 
a photograph, or any number of economic transactions. Even Osama bin 
Laden had (delayed) access to e-mail in his compound, relying on what 
old-timers refer to as “sneakernet,” the process of hand-carrying ﬁ rst ﬂ oppy 
drives and later USB sticks (100 of which were seized in the 2011 com-
mando raid in which bin Laden was killed) from computer to computer.4
Online Dating
Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.
—Sigmund Freud
How have the technological changes of the recent past affected these 
two facets of our existence? In terms of love, we have seen mis-
placed romantic e-mail damage the careers of public ﬁ gures, includ-
ing chief executives and a governor. Finland may show us the wave 
of the future: In 2006, the prime minister met a woman through an 
online dating service, then broke up with her via text messaging a few 
months later, stating economically “Että se” (“that’s it”).
Structured dating services such as Match.com or eHarmony have 
become huge businesses, not counting the vast amount of ﬂ irting 
within the big social networks: Paid online dating sites had become 
essentially a billion-dollar industry in 2008, according to Forrester 
Research, putting it ahead of pornography and making the industry 
slightly more than half as big as digital music and gaming. eHarmony’s 
2010 ad budget was estimated at $90 million.5 Harris Interactive esti-
mates an average of 542 eHarmony users got married—every day—as 
of 2009. Match.com, part of InterActiveCorp, was recognized in 2004 
as the largest dating site in the world and reported 20 million mem-
bers worldwide as of 2011.
Countries around the world are getting involved: In Japan, dat-
ing sites must register with the police, and more than 1,600 such 
companies did so in the ﬁ rst month of the requirement. According to 
New Media Age, UK trafﬁ c to online dating sites grew 13% between 
September 2008 and February 2009: Total visitors to the leading site

currently number about 5 million, reaching 13% of the total UK online 
population. Australia represents a hot new market, with both Match.
com and eHarmony advertising aggressively.
Online matchmaking has many variations. One can search for poten-
tial spouses, for religiously or culturally similar partners, for friends, for 
same-sex prospects, for uncommitted physicality, or, at Toronto’s Ashley 
Madison, be guaranteed an extramarital affair—or your money back. 
The various market segments each have multiple providers, varying by 
geography, matching method, and revenue model. Based only on online 
comments from users rather than any personal experience, claims of dif-
ferentiation between different sites’ matching accuracy and inventory 
may be inﬂ ated: Many people use multiple sites and ﬁ nd the same peo-
ple matching their proﬁ le. Furthermore, the basic model misaligns incen-
tives: Sites do not get paid for good matches.6
As we saw in Chapter 19, when the American Press Institute con-
vened a meeting of newspaper executives to discuss the state of their 
industry, they placed substantial blame on Google for being the “atom 
bomb” to the news industry even as ESPN.com, Monster, Realtor.com, 
and dozens of other sites were eroding newspaper readership long 
before Google News.7 Personal ads are clearly a part of this erosion: 
Match.com, eHarmony, and the rest did not cannibalize all of that $957 
million in U.S. revenue from newspapers, but clearly papers have lost 
some of their mojo in that department. Some independent newspapers 
maintain a strong singles presence, as witness the Chicago Reader or The 
Onion. Mainstream papers, meanwhile, take a variety of approaches. 
Boston.com (the Globe’s online operation) franchises singles from Yahoo! 
The LA Times points readers to eHarmony. Many papers, including the 
New York Times and Dallas Morning News, have no personal ads.
Why is the Internet a good singles market? The decoupling of 
physical location from the search process is a very big deal for market 
“thickness,” not to mention the overall sense of romance and adven-
ture in the process. If you live in a small town, the online services 
broaden your mating horizon.
In addition, the use of algorithmic matching tools is enhancing the 
matching process: eHarmony’s “scientiﬁ c” survey instrument includes 
400 questions, far more than most people ever answer on any unsuc-
cessful ﬁ rst date. As we will see, however, the comprehensiveness of 
the surveys has many implications. At Match.com, the core algorithm 
trades off 1,500 variables. According to the engineer who manages the 
search process, it’s a lot like Netﬂ ix, which uses a similar matching 
algorithm to suggest movies you might like—“except that the movie 
doesn’t have to like you back.”8

Connections 
335
Not surprisingly, the online dating phenomenon has generated 
sometimes-hilarious commentary in the form of vast numbers of blog 
entries and a few books. Such titles as MatchDotBomb: A Midlife 
Journey through Internet Dating, Millions of Women Are Waiting to Meet 
You: A Memoir, and numerous how-to volumes (including a Dummies 
guide) testify to the pervasiveness of this cultural phenomenon.
The unintended consequences are fascinating to watch:
 
 Is it ethical for pay sites to count nonpaying (former) participants 
in a match panel?
 
 How sustainable are the various business and operational mod-
els? Might one technology, celebrity endorsement, or other factor 
prove decisive in a particular market?
 
 What happens to a proﬁ le after the user quits the service, either 
because it worked or because it failed? What rights does the user 
have to his or her proﬁ le on either free or paid services (1) after a 
month, (2) after a year, or (3) after the company goes bankrupt or 
gets acquired?
 
 What are the de facto (when people meet in person) and de jure 
(in court) standards for truthfulness? eHarmony, for example, 
insists that applicants be single: Legally separated individuals are 
excluded and can be banned if they lie to get on. “Truth in adver-
tising” has many nuances in this domain.
 
 What exactly are people paying for? What are the guarantees, war-
ranties, or lack thereof?
 
 How can and will various systems be gamed? Some services have 
been accused, without proof, of employing “ringers” (professional 
ﬁ rst-daters) to exaggerate the quality of available singles.
 
 What will the proﬁ le be used for? Cross-selling opportunities, for 
example, are numerous and more than a little spooky, given the 
extensive questionnaires and behavioral tracking.
 
 While the nightmare blind date has become a cultural stereotype, 
the prospect of meeting truly dangerous people online is more than 
a little scary, as the Boston Craigslist murders suggest. It’s also pos-
sible for bad ﬁ rst encounters to facilitate stalking. A colleague whose 
“thanks for coffee” and the implied “have a nice life” after a pub-
lic, “safe” meeting drove the unsuccessful dating candidate to look 
her up using available search methods. He later turned up on her 
doorstep unannounced. Match.com was sued by a woman raped 
by a convicted sex offender the service set her up with; Match.com 
announced it will now screen for convictions of this sort.

Communications and Relationships 
Networks
Given the characteristics of today’s social communications tools, net-
works of kinship, association, and other types of ties are evolving as well. 
Before looking more closely at Facebook and Twitter, a fundamental 
question relates to how big a person’s meaningful network actually can 
be: Just because technology makes “friend” lists of thousands of individu-
als possible, can a person actually relate to that many contacts in any 
meaningful way?
Robin Dunbar teaches anthropology at Oxford. He compared brain 
sizes for various primates with the size of their social circles and hypoth-
esized that, based on brain size, humans should be able to manage social 
networks of 147.8 people (within a wide error margin).9 What about 
Facebook lists measured in thousands? Research is ongoing, but based 
on address books and other measures, most people interact in meaning-
ful, sustained ways with a much smaller number of friends: As of 2009, 
Facebook’s own measures suggested that an “average” man who has about 
120 friends replies to wall posts of about 7 people; women responded 
regularly to about 10 friends’ posts. Even people with big (greater than 
500) friend counts left comments for 17 people (men) and 26 people 
(women).10
This conceptualization is useful as far as it goes. But in an age of “six 
degrees of separation,” measuring the power of a network is not a matter 
of counting friends, deﬁ ned in whatever way. Beginning with a seminal 
paper by Mark Granovetter in 1973,11 networking science has investigated 
the power of weak ties, not only primary ones: The question is not who 
do you know but whom can your network reach. Richard Bolles popular-
ized the notion in his job-hunting guide, What Color Is Your Parachute?
In the book, Bolles emphasizes that people seldom know the person who 
will hire them when they begin the job search. Parachute ﬁ rst appeared 
in 1970 and has since sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.12
The role of such civic institutions as churches, service clubs, and 
bowling leagues in the wake of suburbanization, television, and more 
women in the workplace has changed slowly but signiﬁ cantly over the 
past 50 years. The matchmaking process has changed as well, and 
the state of online dating businesses will bear watching. In addition, the 
place of Facebook in 20-somethings’ lives is undoubtedly generating its 
own set of changes to courtship.

Making Social Networks Visible: The Case of 9/11
The next article was published in newsletter form on September 13, 
2001, long before the advent of Facebook or Twitter, tools that would 
have changed the way that fateful day unfolded.
This week’s attacks and the subsequent deaths are being pain-
fully felt. Everybody, it seems, knows someone who knows 
someone who died or was injured. Here in Boston, the odds 
of being connected are especially high, while our hearts go 
out to the New Yorkers living with so much uncertainty and 
dread. At this time of tragedy, the phenomenon known as “six 
degrees of separation” feels different. Each of us connects to 
the computer network administrators, or the daughters, or the 
ﬁ re ﬁ ghters, or the air travelers for some personal reason: I’ve 
ﬂ own American 11 to LA probably a dozen times, for example, 
and everyone has some similar story that connects him or her 
to some facet of the tragedy. In this moment, rather than talk 
about cell phone antennas or Internet slowdowns or American 
government digital snooping efforts to gather clues, I wanted 
to point to some fascinating research that shows some weird 
and wonderful aspects of networks that underlie this dynamic 
of personal involvement.
The story begins with a distinguished Hungarian math-
ematician, Paul Erdo˝s, who died in 1996 with an academic 
body of 1500 research papers. For years after, however, unpub-
lished work came out. Erdo˝s’ eminence, combined with aca-
demics’ love of the obtuse, spawned an ongoing conversation 
among math professors about their “Erdo˝s number”—how 
many links connect any given professor with Erdo˝s as a 
 co-author. The lower one’s number (1 if co-author with Erdo˝s, 
2 if a co-author with a 1, etc), the presumably higher one’s 
own reputation. As of 2000, the number of people 1 remove 
from Erdo˝s was 507. What’s interesting, apart from the trac-
tion of the exercise, is Erdo˝s’ inﬂ uence: 60 Nobel prize winners 
have relatively low Erdo˝s numbers (Watson’s and Crick’s are 
7 and 8, respectively, despite their ﬁ eld’s distance from pure 
math), while 42 winners of the profession’s Fields medal (the 
highest honor in mathematics) have low Erdo˝s numbers—most 
four or less, with all under 6.

We then move outside mathematics, in 1967, to Stanley 
Milgram, the same psychologist responsible for the “we do as 
we’re told” experiment in which subjects rather willingly 
administered ﬁ ctional (but apparently real) electric shocks to 
other people under orders of an authority ﬁ gure. Along a dif-
ferent research direction he created an experiment to see how 
social networks actually behave. He asked people in Kansas 
and Nebraska to get letters to people in Boston by sending the 
letters to people the Kansans and Nebraskans thought might 
know the recipients personally. The recipients did the same 
thing, forwarding the notes and notifying Milgram of their 
participation. The letters took from 2 to 10 hops to arrive, with 
the average being ﬁ ve. Why Milgram termed the phenomenon 
six degrees of separation remains a mystery, but the small 
number of intermediaries poses a riddle.13
If, as sociologists estimate, each American knows about 
300 people, and there are about 270 million Americans, sim-
ple math suggests that it would take on average about a mil-
lion handshakes to connect any given person to any other one. 
The problematic assumption here, however, is that the networks 
are evenly distributed. If all the people I know only know each 
other, it’s a closed community. At the other extreme, accord-
ing to Steve Strogatz of Cornell, if I know 100 people, and each 
of them knows 100 people, I’m two hops from 10,000 people, 
three from 1 million, and ﬁ ve degrees from the entire planet—
but that assumes zero overlap, that each of 100 people has 100 
more friends not already in the network.
It is the middle ground between closed order and complete 
randomness that Strogatz and his graduate student Duncan 
Watts investigated. This story made headlines in 1997 and 
1998 when the six degrees of Kevin Bacon game was resonat-
ing with many people’s experience with the Internet. Whether 
in terms of web links or e-mail communities, many people 
found that they knew someone who knew someone who could 
answer their question or procure a desired item. (In fact, Lada 
Adamic at Xerox PARC showed that within a large percentage 
of the Web, any webpage was an average of four hyperlinks 
from any other.)
Watts and Strogatz found that only a tiny—1%—increase 
in randomness had orders of magnitude implications for 
reducing the number of intermediaries between points A and B.

339
What’s interesting is that redoing those few connections doesn’t 
change the clustering within the network—most of your friends 
still know each other. The other factor here is that the con-
nections are extremely unevenly distributed: everyone knows 
someone who’s always sending along e-mail jokes or indus-
try buzz. His or her e-mail friend network will have far more 
one-degree connections than average. At the same time, there 
are info-hounds who are the recipients of many feeds but the 
spreaders of few. Marketing experts like Seth Godin are looking 
at the network problem from this perspective.
Back to Watts and Strogatz, this is when the story gets 
weird: the same network structure, ordered with a tuned 
amount of randomness, explains not only Kevin Bacon’s 
movie career but the western U.S. electric power grid topology 
and the neural structure of a worm called a nematode. The 
implications of this incredible ﬁ nding are only beginning to 
be exhausted. Two business school professors found that small 
world networks, as they’re called, explain the ownership struc-
ture of over 500 large German companies: any one ﬁ rm is 
connected to any other by only four intermediaries. The fact 
that consciously engineered systems, natural systems, and 
cumulative patterns of behavior all can be represented by the 
same graphical model is truly stunning.
So in the midst of our public and private grief, the 
feeling of connection to the victims relate to a powerful 
 phenomenon—one still mysterious even to experts like Watts 
and Strogatz, who speak with a certain reverence about it. 
What tragedies do is activate our sense of our networks: none 
of us goes around asking our coworkers if they have a friend 
or relative who works in, say, Miami or Milan unless there’s 
some reason to wonder. One we identify end points—the lists of 
the dead or the stories of survival—then the network of human 
connection emerges, and from there we cry, or give thanks, or 
give blood, or do any of the other myriad of things people have 
done for millennia to heal each other in times of suffering.14
The question of how big a social network can or should be remains 
open. Google’s Plus service, designed to compete with Facebook, allows 
multiple types of friend and acquaintance networks called circles. Path, a 
start-up photo-sharing site, caps one’s network at 50 people, presumably 
to maintain intimacy. Twitter’s follower model provides an alternative to

Facebook: A person’s broadcasting persona can be managed more straight-
forwardly than in Facebook, where reciprocity is more the norm among 
individuals. For celebrities, Twitter gives the person an alternative to media 
spin, and more than once a rumor has been corrected by the subject. At 
the same time, numerous high-proﬁ le athletes have been done in by their 
own words; ethnic and homophobic slurs are, unfortunately, common.
At the same time that people try to understand the size of digital social 
networks, the qualitative issues also give pause. The things that people 
share are not universally appreciated: A recent trend is YouTube videos of 
one’s pregnancy tests, as we saw in Chapter 31. Facebook’s ever-shifting 
deﬁ nitions of user privacy defaults frustrate many users. Finally, some of 
the implicit Facebook narratives, especially among women, are problem-
atic: About a third of women surveyed in 2011 complained about people 
who “bragged about seemingly perfect lives.” Two-thirds of the survey 
population complained about complainers; “drama queens” and political 
evangelists also were common targets.15
Creation
There’s a debate in some academic circles over what are called “gen-
erative” technologies. According to Jonathan Zittrain, a law professor at 
Harvard, examples include:
Technologies like personal computers that have the capacity to 
 produce unprompted, user-driven change. For example, on a PC 
any person can write code, run that code on a variety of platforms, 
and share that code with anyone who might want it. In general, 
generative technologies are useful for performing tasks, adaptable, 
easy to master, permission-free, and share-able. In the name of 
security consumers are increasingly moving away from generative 
technologies like the PC and towards tethered ones like the iPhone.16
In point of fact, very few people could write code on PCs, Microsoft 
controlled much of the innovation of the platform, and PCs were not (and 
still are not) “easy to master.” While the Apple mobile platforms are cer-
tainly more locked down than the Apple IIs of the 1980s and Wintel PCs of 
the 1990s, meanwhile, the trade-off in ease of use means that smartphones 
are arguably generative in that they create change far beyond the blueprint 
of the inventors. Text messaging is a great example. Locality-based social 
networking is another. Mobile cameras and video are nothing if not creative.
At the level of the Internet, mash-ups are easier to create than PCs 
were to code. The availability of resources for artistic, informative, and

social/political expression are vast, and the long tail of user-generated 
content means that more people than ever before can ﬁ nd an audience. 
Resources (maps, music, news, calculators, and data), tools, and distribu-
tion have all become free. The staggering growth of mobile and then other 
forms of app stores is also signiﬁ cant: Whereas “any person” could write 
code for the PC, theoretically, the wealth of creativity unleashed by the 
economic promise of the iPhone and Android to software developers is not 
to be dismissed.
At the enterprise level, another facet of creativity bears mentioning. 
Whereas the buzzphrase of the late 1990s was “knowledge management,” 
one doesn’t hear that much anymore. Rather than building expensive, 
rigid hierarchical systems for managing knowledge, there’s a much greater 
awareness of the social context in which innovation, or good customer 
service, or effective marketing can emerge. Thus, enterprise tool makers, 
including SAP, and vendors, including IBM, are building Facebook-like 
infrastructure for companies that seek to unleash the brainpower and net-
works of employees, suppliers, partners, and customers.
Procter & Gamble (P&G) is one case in point: By opening its famously 
homogeneous corporate culture to external partners in the Connect and 
Develop program launched in 2001, new product introductions, cross-
licensing agreements, and, most crucially, revenues have grown after 
stagnating in the 1990s.17 The company’s Old Spice brand enjoyed record 
growth in 2010 after an enormously clever social media/broadcast cam-
paign featuring an entertainingly articulate spokesmodel. The degree of 
trust between ad agency, other partners, and the P&G team was noted 
at the time as being exceptional, and it is likely not an accident that the 
changing technology landscape coupled with the conscious shift in atti-
tudes and behaviors across P&G helped to create that positive chemistry.18
Looking Ahead
At the level of individuals, families, tribes, and formal organizations, 
changes to the connective tissue are reshaping both the interpersonal con-
nections and the nature of the group. Liking someone, or some topic, or 
some item or product is not the same proposition it was 20 years ago. 
The artifacts of a personal connection have also changed, with conse-
quences for relationships, for law, and for commerce. The deﬁ nitional 
distinctions between relationships, networks, and markets are fuzzy. All 
told, people’s relationships are more complicated, more documented, 
and richer with possibility than ever before. Those relationships are set in 
physical contexts that themselves are in transition, and it is to that topic to 
which we turn next.

CHAPTER 33
Place, Space, and Time
What does it mean to be “someplace”? What does it mean to exist independently of 
physical constraints? How fast is fast? When is “right now”?
For millennia, geography has deﬁ ned human civilizations. As our com-
munications capability increases, as measured by technical speciﬁ cations 
if not necessarily emotional ones, the need to be physically located in a 
certain place to do a job, support a social movement, or complete a busi-
ness transaction is becoming less of an absolute constraint. Mobile phones, 
cloud computing, and other tools (such as lightweight project management 
software or online social networks) allow people and resources to be orga-
nized without physical contact; this might be called the emerging domain 
of space, as in “cyber.” People can put up virtual storefronts on eBay, let 
Amazon be their supply chain, rent computing from Google to run code 
written in India, and let PayPal be their treasury system. Salesforce.com 
keeps track of customers and prospects; ADP runs payroll once enough 
employees sign on. Thus, the actual “business” could physically be the size 
of a laptop computer.
As place becomes negotiable, so does time. Asynchronous television 
viewing, for example, is reshaping the cable TV landscape. Comcast bought 
NBC Universal, which in turn was part of the Hulu joint venture. Apart from 
sports, college students watch very little television at its scheduled time, or 
over its traditional channel for that matter. Shopping has also become time-
shifted: One can easily walk into Sears, shop at a kiosk, and have the item 
delivered to a physical address, or else shop online and drive to the store 
for faster pickup than FedEx can manage. At the other end of the time spec-
trum, tools like Twitter are far faster than TV news, not to mention print 
newspapers. Voicemail seems primitive now that it’s roughly 30 years old, a 
time-shifting capability now taken for granted.

Information, Technology, and Innovation: Resources for  
Growth in a Connected World 
By John M. Jordan

Place, Space, and Time
Place and time increasingly interconnect. Real-time package track-
ing for a routine Amazon purchase contrasts dramatically with a common 
scene at automobile dealerships: A customer saw a vehicle on the Web site 
earlier in the week and none of the salespeople knows what happened to 
it. UPS can track more than 15 million packages per day while a car dealer 
can lose a $15,000 two-ton vehicle, one of a few dozen, from a fenced 
concrete lot. Customer expectations are set by the former experience and 
are growing increasingly intolerant of the latter.
The corollary of that place/time ﬂ exibility, however, is being tracked: 
Everybody with digital assets is plugged into some kind of informa-
tion grid, and those grids can be mapped. Sometimes it’s voluntary: 
Foursquare, Shopkick, and Facebook Places turn one’s announced location 
into games.* More often, though, Big Brother’s watch is without consent: 
London’s security cameras are controlled by the same police department 
accused of using ofﬁ cial assets in the service of the Murdoch newspapers’ 
snooping on innocent citizens. As we have seen, the entire idea of digital 
privacy, its guarantees and redresses, for bad guys and for everyday folk, 
is still primitive.
Examples are everywhere: Google Street View has proved controver-
sial in Europe and Germany in particular. Local “open records” laws have 
yet to be rethought in the age of instant global access: It’s one thing for 
the neighbors to stop by town hall to see how much the new family paid 
for their house but something else entirely (we don’t really know what) 
when tens of millions of such transactions are searchable—especially 
within overlays of Street View, Bing’s bird’s-eye aerial (as opposed to sat-
ellite) imagery, and other potentially intrusive mechanisms.
In 2009, a Wired magazine reporter attempted to vanish using a com-
bination of physical disguises and digital trickery: prepaid cell phones, 
proxy servers for Internet Protocol address masking, cash-purchased gift 
cards. He was found though a combination of old-fashioned detective 
work and sophisticated network analysis: He was signing on to Facebook 
with an alias, and the alias had few real friends, making his identity an 
anomaly. Tellingly, the Facebook group he was lurking in was comprised 
of people trying to ﬁ nd him.1 Elsewhere, fraudsters are creating synthetic 
identities from publicly gleaned information: Any given detail checks out 
with a real person, but the composite whole is fake. The intersections of 
place and space are growing more curious every year.
*Getting people’s actual location information can be tricky: A clever hacker made 
himself mayor (in Foursquare terms) of the North Pole and sparked a fascinating 
discussion. Such gamesmanship will increase as the stakes get higher; see www
.krazydad.com/blog/2010/02/mayor-of-the-north-pole/.

Virtuality 
345
Virtuality
From its origins as a network perimeter tunnel (virtual private networks 
gave people the ability to see computing resources inside the ﬁ rewall 
while being physically remote from the corporate facility), virtualization 
has become a major movement within enterprise computing. Rather than 
dedicating a piece of hardware to a particular piece of software, hardware 
becomes more fungible. In a perfect virtual world, people with applications 
they need to run can schedule the necessary resources (possibly priced by 
an auction mechanism), do their work, then retreat from the infrastructure 
until they next need computing. In this way, the theory goes, server utiliza-
tion is improved: All the downtime associated with captive hardware can go 
ofﬂ ine, freeing computing to be used to the current work, whatever its size, 
shape, or origin.
Once again, physical presence (in this case, big computers in a 
 temperature-controlled facility with expensive redundant network and 
power connections, physical security, and specialized technicians tending 
the machines) is disconnected from data and/or application logic. In many 
consumer  scenarios, people act this way without thinking twice: look-
ing at Google Maps instead of Rand McNally, using the online version of 
TurboTax, or even reading Facebook is “virtual”: No software package 
resides on the user’s machine, and the physical location of the actual com-
puting is both invisible and irrelevant.
From the world of computing, it’s a short hop to the world of work. 
People no longer need to go to the physical assets if they’re not doing 
work on somebody else’s drill presses and assembly lines: Brain work, a 
large component of the services economy, is often independent of  physical 
capital and thus of scheduled shifts. “Working from home” is common-
place, and with the rise of the smartphone, work becomes an anytime/
anywhere proposition for more and more people. What this seamlessness 
means for identity, for health, for family and relationships, and for business 
performance has yet to be either named or sorted out.
Another dimension of virtuality is personal. Whether in Linden Labs’ 
Second Life, World of Warcraft, or any number of other venues, millions 
of people play roles and interact through a software persona. As process-
ing power and connection quality increase, these avatars will get more 
capable, more interesting, and more common. One fascinating possibil-
ity relates to virtual permanence: Even if the base-layer person dies or 
quits the environment, the virtual identity can age (or, like Bart Simpson, 
remain timeless) and can either grow and learn or remain blissfully 
unaware of change in its own life or the various outside worlds.2
Practical applications of virtualization for everyday life seem to be 
emerging. In South Korea, busy commuters can shop for groceries at

transparencies of store shelves identical to those at their nearby Tesco  
Homeplus store; the photos of the products bear two-dimensional bar 
codes which, when scanned and purchased, generate orders that are bun-
dled together for home delivery. Picking up ingredients for dinner on the 
way home from work is a time-honored ritual; here, the shopper chooses 
the items but never touches them until arriving at his or her residence.3
Cisco is making a major play toward virtual collaboration in enterprise 
videoconferencing; its preferred term, “telepresence,” hasn’t caught on, but 
the idea has. Given the changes to air travel in the past 10 years (longer 
check-in times, fewer empty seats, higher fares), compounded by oil price 
shocks, many people dislike ﬂ ying more than they used to. Organizations 
on lean budgets also look to travel as an expense category ripe for cutting, 
so videoconferencing is coming into its own at some ﬁ rms. Cisco reports 
that it has used the technology to save more than $800 million over ﬁ ve 
years; productivity gains add up, by its math, to another $350 million.4
Videoconferencing is also popular with individuals, but it isn’t called 
that: In July 2011, Skype’s chief executive said that users make about 
300 million minutes of video calls per month, which is about the same as 
pure voice connections. The point for our purposes is that rich interaction 
can facilitate relationships and collaboration in the absence of physical prox-
imity, at very low cost in hardware, software, and connection. As recently 
as 2005, a corporate videoconference facility could cost more than a half 
million U.S. dollars to install; monthly connection charges were another 
$18,000, or $216,000 annually.5 In 2011, many tablets and laptop computers 
include cameras, and Skype downloads are free.
Organizations
Given that vertical integration has its limits in speed and the cost of 
capital investment (both in dollars and in opportunity costs), partner-
ing has become a crucial capability. While few companies can emulate 
the lightweight, proﬁ t-free structure of Linux, a hacker’s collective like 
Anonymous, or Wikipedia, neither can many ﬁ rms assume that they con-
trol all necessary resources under their own roof. Thus, the conventional 
bureaucracy model is challenged to open up, to connect data and other 
currencies to partners. Whether it involves sharing requirements docu-
ments, blueprints for review, production schedules, regulatory signoffs, 
or other routine but essential categories of information, few companies 
can quickly yet securely vet, map, and integrate a partner organization. 
Differences in nomenclature, signing authority or span of control, time 
zones, language, and/or currency, and any number of other characteris-
tics complicate the interaction. So-called onboarding—granting a partner

appropriate data access—can be a months-long process, particularly in 
secure (aerospace and defense) or regulated settings. Creating a selec-
tively permeable membrane to let in the good guys, let out the proper 
information, turn off the faucet when it’s not being used, and maintain 
trade secrets throughout has proven to be nontrivial.6
Automata
What would happen if a person’s avatar could behave independently? If 
an attractive bargain comes up at Woot, buy it for me. If someone posts 
something about me on a social network, notify me or, better yet, cor-
rect any inaccuracies. If the cat leaves the house through the pet door 
and doesn’t return within two hours, call the pet sitter. Who would bear 
responsibility for the avatar’s actions: the person on whose behalf it is 
“working”? the software writer? the environment in which it operates?
Once all those avatars started interacting independently, unpredictable 
things might happen, the equivalent of two moose getting their antlers 
stuck together in the wild or of a DVD refusing to play on some devices 
but not others because of a scratch on the disc. Avatars might step out of 
each other’s way or might trample each other in mobs. They might adapt 
to new circumstances, or they might freeze up in the face of unexpected 
inputs. Some avatars might stop and wait for human guidance; others 
might create quite a bit of havoc given a particular set of circumstances.
It’s one thing for a person’s physical butler, nanny, or broker to act 
on his or her behalf but something else quite new for software to be mak-
ing such decisions. Rather than being a hypothetical thought experiment, 
these scenarios are already real. Software “snipers” win eBay auctions 
with the lowest possible winning bid at the last possible moment. Google 
Alerts can watch for Web postings that ﬁ t my criteria and forward them.
More signiﬁ cantly, Wall Street transactions generated by the jacketed 
ﬂ oor traders waving their hands furiously are a dying breed. So-called 
algorithmic trading is a broad category that includes high-frequency trad-
ing (HFT), in which bids, asks, and order cancelations are computer-to-
computer interactions that might last less than a second (and thus cannot 
involve human traders). By itself, HFT is estimated to generate more than 
75% of equities trading volume; nearly half of commodity futures (includ-
ing oil) trading volume is also estimated to be computer-generated in some 
capacity.7 The ﬁ rms that specialize in such activity are often not brand 
names, and most prefer not to release data that may expose sources of com-
petitive advantage. Thus, the actual numbers are not widely known.
What is known is that algorithms can go wrong, and when they go 
wrong at scale, consequences can be signiﬁ cant. The May 6, 2010 “ﬂ ash

crash” is still not entirely understood, but the source of the New York Stock 
Exchange’s biggest, fastest loss (998 points) in history lies in large measure 
in the complex system of competing algorithms running trillions of dollars 
of investment. The longtime ﬁ nancial fundamentalist John Bogle—founder of 
the Vanguard Group—pulled no punches in his analysis: “The whole system 
failed. In an era of intense technology, bad things can happen so rapidly. 
Technology can accelerate things to the point that we lose control.”8
Artifacts of the algorithmic failure were just plain weird. Apple stock 
hit $100,000 a share for a moment; Accenture, a computer services pro-
vider, instantaneously dropped from $40 to a cent only to bounce back a 
few seconds later. Circuit breakers, or arrangements to halt trading once 
certain limits are exceeded, were tripping repeatedly. (For example, if a 
share price moves more than 10% in a ﬁ ve-minute interval, trading can 
be halted for a ﬁ ve-minute break.) A bigger question relates to the HFT 
ﬁ rms that, in good times, provide liquidity but that can withdraw from 
the market without notice and in doing so make trading more difﬁ cult. 
Technically speaking, the exchanges’ information systems were found 
to have shortcomings: Some price quotes were more than two seconds 
delayed, which represents an extreme lag in a market where computer-
generated actions measure in the millions per second.
Implications
What does it mean to be somewhere? As people sitting together in col-
lege cafeterias both text other people while dining face to face, what 
does it mean to be physically present? What does it mean to “be at work”? 
Conversely, what does it mean to be “on vacation”? If I am at my job, how 
is my output or lack thereof measured? As discussed, counting lines of code 
proved to be a bad way to measure software productivity, but alternatives 
are not simple. How many jobs measure performance by the quality of 
ideas generated, the quality of collaboration facilitated, the quality of cus-
tomer service? These are difﬁ cult to instrument, so industrial-age measures, 
including physical output, remain popular even as services (which lend 
themselves to extreme virtualization) grow in importance and impact. In 
most organizations, activity measures (e.g., phone calls answered) are more 
common than outcome measures such as how many callers left satisﬁ ed.
What is a resource? Who creates it, gets access to it, bears respon-
sibility for its use or misuse? Where do resources “live”? How are they 
protected? What is obsolescence? How are out-of-date resources retired 
from service? Enterprise application software, for example, often lives 
well past its useful life; ask any chief information ofﬁ cer how many zom-
bie enterprise applications she has running. Invisible to the naked eye,

software can take on a life of its own, and once another program con-
nects to it (the output of a sales forecasting program might be used in 
human resource scheduling or in marketing planning), the life span likely 
increases: Complexity makes pruning more difﬁ cult since turning off an 
application might have dire consequences at the next quarterly close, the 
next annual performance review, or the next audit. Better to err on the side 
of safety and leave things running.
What does it mean for information to be weightless, massless, and inﬁ -
nitely portable? Book collections are becoming a thing of the past for many 
readers, as Kindle ﬁ gures and Google searches can attest: Having a refer-
ence collection near the dining room used to be essential in some academic 
households, to settle dinnertime contests. Photographs, either organized into 
albums or collected in shoe boxes, were heavy. Music used to weigh a lot, 
in the form of LP records. Compact discs were lighter, but the plastic jewel 
box proved to be a particularly poor storage solution. MP3 downloads elim-
inated the software but still needed bits to be stored on a personal hard 
drive. Now that’s changing, to the point where physical books, newspapers, 
music, and movies all share a cloud-based solution. The result is a demate-
rialization of many people’s lives: Book collections, record collections, sheet 
music—artifacts that deﬁ ned millions of people—are now disappearing, 
for good ecological reasons but with as-yet-undetermined ramiﬁ cations for 
identity, not to mention decorating. It also puts the network in a position 
where it must work, yet bandwidth and backup are often less than robust.
What does it mean to bear personal responsibility? If software operat-
ing in my name does something bad, did I do anything? What if I wrote 
code that did bad things? If I am not physically present at my university, 
my workplace, or my political organization, how loosely or tightly am I 
connected to the institution, to its people, to its agenda? Harvard sociolo-
gist Robert Putnam worried about the implications of the decline in the 
number of American bowling leagues; are Facebook groups a substitute 
for, or an improvement on, physical manifestations of civic engagement?9 
If so, which groups, and which forms of engagement? In other words, at 
the scale of 700-plus million users, saying anything about Facebook is 
impossible, given the number of caveats, exceptions, and innovations: 
Facebook today is not what it will be a year from now, whereas bowling 
leagues have been pretty stable for decades.
Looking Ahead
The ﬂ uidity of  (physical) place, (cyber) space, and time has far-reaching 
implications for getting work done, for entrepreneurial opportunity, and 
for personal identity. As with so many other innovations, the technologists

who are capable of writing code and designing and building breakthrough 
devices have little sense of what those innovations will mean. The sail-
ing ship meant, in part, that Britain could establish a global empire; the 
ﬁ rst century of the automobile meant wars for oil, environmental degrada-
tion, new shapes for cities, the postwar rise of Japan, and unprecedented 
personal mobility, to start a very long list. What barely 30 years of per-
sonal computing, 20 years of the commercial Internet, and a relatively few 
months of smartphones might mean is impossible to tell so far, but it looks 
like they could mean a lot.

CHAPTER 34
Conﬂ ict
As the basis for daily life, ﬁ rst-world economies, and much of the world’s innovation 
moves into the world of information and communications, it’s inevitable that bad guys 
and bad actions migrate there as well. The term “information warfare” doesn’t really 
mean anything speciﬁ c, so it’s worth looking at a few of the ways computing and com-
munications are reshaping crime and conﬂ ict. These areas might represent business 
opportunities for some, risks for others, and points of departure: Innovation is occur-
ring on the dark side as well as in the light.
The intersection of technology, economics, politics, and violence that 
occurred in the summer of 2011 was nothing short of a milestone. When 
young people used Facebook and Twitter to organize riots in London, 
the social media tools were frequently blamed for the violence. Given the 
wide scale of the events of August and the diversity of participants, such 
an explanation is insufﬁ cient. Certainly, communications tools including 
BlackBerry Messenger were used to coordinate sometimes-professional 
criminals who were looting from prearranged lists. Other violence was 
copycat, undoubtedly fueled in part by hot summer temperatures, high 
unemployment, and political alienation. Once more, the superb effective-
ness of mobile and Internet technologies in facilitating group behavior was 
on display, in the service of various ends: After the damage was done, the 
most popular Twitter term over the four days of rioting was “riotcleanup.”1
Warfare between Nation-States
As the United States formalizes its military posture relative to electronic 
intrusions and attacks, the relationship between cyberattacks and physi-
cal responses is being weighed carefully. Off the record, one “military

ofﬁ cial” reserves the right to respond to code with explosives: “If you 
shut down our power grid, maybe we will put a missile down one of 
your smokestacks.”2 On the record, the initial formulation of cyberstrat-
egy emphasizes preparedness and effective defense: “By sharing timely 
indicators about cyber events, threat signatures of malicious code, and 
information about emerging actors and threats, allies and international 
partners can increase collective cyber defense.” Other elements of the 
strategy fall under the category of common sense: “Most vulnerabilities 
of and malicious acts against DoD [Department of Defense] systems can 
be addressed through good cyber hygiene,” such as strong passwords, 
limited use of USB drives in secure facilities, and regular antivirus sweeps 
and updates.3 The formulation and execution of cyberwarfare strategy is 
only beginning, and much remains to be determined.
The lack of “ﬁ ngerprints,” for example, means that the origin of 
attacks can be difﬁ cult to trace. Networks of infected computers around 
the world can be rented to serve in so-called botnets that launch spam, 
denial-of-service attacks, or malware such as keystroke loggers or phish-
ing e-mails. A nation-state actor can just as easily employ (or appear to 
employ) such a resource as could a criminal enterprise. The United States 
and Korea have been subjected to sophisticated attacks at scale in both 
2009 and 2011, and while North Korea is an obvious suspect, deﬁ nitive 
evidence was not immediately available.4
The debate over “missiles down smokestacks” is a recent manifesta-
tion of longer-running debate in military circles: What is the relationship 
between information and action? One answer can be found in a recent 
theory of battleﬁ eld strategy. Designed by an Air Force colonel named 
John Boyd, the inelegantly named (and never really explained*) OODA 
loop seeks to attack the opponent’s decision-making faculty rather than its 
armament.5 Observation, orientation, decision, and action are the stages 
of tactical behavior, according to the doctrine, but not in a rote life-cycle 
sense. According to one interpretation, “Orientation—how you interpret a 
situation, based on your experience, culture, and heritage—directly guides 
decisions, but it also shapes observation and action. At the same time, ori-
entation is shaped by new feedback.” For Boyd, effective warriors watch 
for “mismatches between his original understanding and a changed reality. 
In those mismatches lie opportunities to seize advantage.”6
Given that reality is ceaselessly changing, continuous adaptation is 
required; as the German ﬁ eld marshall Helmuth von Moltke is said to have 
proclaimed in the late nineteenth century, “No battle plan survives contact 
*Boyd’s preferred mode of transmitting the idea was an in-person 14-hour presen-
tation of overhead transparencies.

with the enemy.” Given the inevitable chaos, Boyd wrote, “We must con-
tinue the whirl of reorientation, mismatches, analyses/synthesis over and 
over again ad inﬁ nitum.” In short, as the opponent seeks to ground him-
self on something, anything familiar, the aggressor can capitalize on the 
newness of the actual situation.
Boyd’s ideas gained traction in peculiar ways, as beﬁ ts the stubborn 
iconoclast who generated them. His home service disregarded the OODA 
loop, whereas the Marine Corps, operating as it does on lean resources 
and speed rather than mass and scale, seized on the concept. The highly 
successful design of the attack on Iraq in the early 1990s was classic 
Boyd: Move fast, disorient the enemy, paralyze their responses. Fifteen 
Iraqi divisions surrendered to two divisions of U.S. Marines. When asked 
how this had happened, Brigadier General Richard I. Neal, the U.S. mili-
tary spokesman, said on national television: “We kind of got inside their 
decision cycle.”7
A blunter attempt to disrupt an opponent’s information environment 
can be seen in the Chinese launch of an antisatellite missile in 2007. By 
knocking down one of its own aging weather satellites that orbits at the 
same altitude as U.S. intelligence birds, China sent a strong signal. As 
Foreign Affairs put it:
With the United States now depending so heavily on assets in space 
for real-time communications, battleﬁ eld awareness, weapons tar-
geting, intelligence gathering, and reconnaissance, the Chinese 
rocket launch may have been an attempt to show Washington how 
Beijing can overcome its handicap in a relatively simple way.8
As the evolving cyberwarfare doctrine illustrates, the response to such a 
strike has yet to be determined: If China damages a U.S. military satel-
lite, either with missiles or lasers (which cannot down a satellite but can 
impair the optics of imaging systems), is it an act of war, even though no 
U.S. territory or American citizens were breached or harmed? Someday a 
commander in chief may have to answer that question.
Non-Nation-State Actors
Iraq’s open-ﬁ eld battles were the last of their sort for quite a while. 
Battling loose networks of insurgents in what is called asymmetric war-
fare has been the primary order of business for more than a decade. In 
such conﬂ icts, heavy weapons can be a liability, or at least are neutralized 
insofar as the opponent typically cannot be attacked, bombed, or sunk 
by conventional means. Information thus plays a central role in both the

insurgencies and in nation-states’ response to them. Al Qaeda in Iraq (a 
spinoff group of the original “brand”), for example, routinely videotapes 
improvised explosive device (IED) detonations for use as recruiting and 
motivational tools on various Web sites.9
Other forms of digital warfare are emerging. The lack of traceability 
of cyberwarfare means that nation-states can get software to do work for 
which missiles or bombs might be ill-suited politically. Such was appar-
ently the case in 2010 when a software virus called Stuxnet was targeted 
extremely speciﬁ cally: It attacked Siemens industrial devices, speciﬁ cally 
the centrifuges at Iran’s nuclear enrichment facility. With extreme sophis-
tication, the virus embedded itself in the SCADA (supervisory control and 
data acquisition) system that controlled the industrial apparatus, then sent 
false signals to the monitoring system, indicating that devices were oper-
ating properly. Once the centrifuges spun up in an erratic manner, some 
were damaged, with the effect of slowing Iran’s nuclear program. Ofﬁ cial 
responsibility has never been claimed, but several strong clues point to 
the United States and Israel being involved.10 Stuxnet is the ﬁ rst docu-
mented episode of an attack on industrial control systems; similar systems 
control power plants, chemical facilities, and military installations.11
Another theme in information-age conﬂ ict revolves around secrets: 
The entire life cycle of intelligence gathering is sensitive, including not 
just the facts (country X has 100 missiles aimed at country Y) but also who 
asked, who told, and who took notice. WikiLeaks gained considerable 
attention in 2010 when it published roughly 480,000 documents related 
to the U.S. war in Afghanistan, then made another release of 250,000 U.S. 
State Department diplomatic cables that compromised both sources and 
diplomats. The Web site’s architecture is impossible to conceive of in any 
age before the current one, in which control of media outlets has wid-
ened. WikiLeaks’ founder, Julian Assange, calls it “an uncensorable system 
for untraceable mass document leaking and public analysis.”12 To remove 
content from WikiLeaks, an entity would have to “practically dismantle the 
Internet itself,” in the words of an analysis in The New Yorker from 2010.13 
While technology protects the openness of the secrets, human traits—
pride, vices, carelessness, and ideological commitments—made them 
available in the ﬁ rst place.
The mission of this powerful medium is spelled out in noble terms:
WikiLeaks is a non-proﬁ t media organization dedicated to bring-
ing important news and information to the public. We provide an 
innovative, secure, and anonymous way for independent sources 
around the world to leak information to our journalists. We publish 
material of ethical, political, and historical signiﬁ cance while keep-

ing the identity of our sources anonymous, thus providing a uni-
versal way for the revealing of suppressed and censored injustices.14
With its robust, distributed servers and an international legal system 
ill-equipped for this type of approach, WikiLeaks confronts established 
governments and corporations with a challenge to the basic need for 
secrets: “Publishing improves transparency,” the Web site asserts,
and this transparency creates a better society for all people. Better 
scrutiny leads to reduced corruption and stronger democracies in 
all society’s institutions, including government, corporations and 
other organisations. A healthy, vibrant and inquisitive journalistic 
media plays a vital role in achieving these goals. We are part of 
that media.15
The rhetorical sleight of hand here is signiﬁ cant. Aligning WikiLeaks 
with media as opposed to treason or espionage puts secret holders on the 
defensive insofar as WikiLeaks has published veriﬁ able material: The site’s 
record of veracity has not been seriously questioned. But it is not entirely 
clear whether the site’s objective is to bring truth to light (i.e., a quasi-
journalistic stance) or to cripple the operations of institutions it deems ille-
gitimate. Such governance is by Assange’s deﬁ nition conspiratorial; it is 
generated by people in “collaborative secrecy, working to the detriment of 
a population.”16 Much like Boyd, Assange argued that when an institution’s 
communication connections are disrupted, the information ﬂ ow among 
conspirators drops, to the point that the conspiracy becomes unsustain-
able. As The New Yorker analysis summarized, “Leaks were an instrument 
of information warfare.”17
While the role of founder Julian Assange may change as he sorts out 
multiple legal problems, the basic model of WikiLeaks will likely persist, 
even if its current incarnation is shut down by ﬁ nancial, legal, or personal-
ity issues. Digital secrets are too easy to ﬁ nd, to move, and to distribute 
for this genie to be put back into its bottle. WikiLeaks has inspired other 
similar projects, and in 2011 an even more diffuse, distributed effort was 
devoted, in part, against the very concept of security.
Whereas WikiLeaks has a public spokesman, a vetting procedure, and 
a fundraising component, the loose hacker collectives of 2011 have fanci-
ful names, occasional manifestos, and apparently some skilled technolo-
gists. The identities of the people associated with Anonymous, LulzSec, 
and imitators are as-yet unknown, though some arrests have been made 
in the United States and United Kingdom. The targets range from the silly 
to the deadly serious; Rupert Murdoch’s ﬁ ctitious death was splashed on

the cover of one of his newspapers while e-mail addresses and passwords 
for Arizona public safety personnel were published in response to that 
state’s anti-immigration posture, which the group regards as racist.18
Anonymous gained prominence in 2010 when it attacked PayPal and 
MasterCard after the payment sites cut off donations made to WikiLeaks. The 
group quickly multiplied its efforts. When Sony sought to sue a hacker who 
made it possible to run Linux on PlayStations (as the original PlayStation did), 
Anonymous attacked the PlayStation Network, but at an organizational level 
(such as it is) denied the roughly simultaneous leaking of 100 million Sony 
user accounts that turned out to have been particularly poorly  protected.* 
Other targets of 2011 included the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 
the Public Broadcasting System, and the U.S. Senate Web site; afﬁ liated 
groups claimed to have attacked the government of Brazil. Government sites 
in Turkey were attacked in response to attempted Internet censorship. Booz 
Allen Hamilton, an information services provider to the U.S. government, had 
90,000 e-mail accounts and encrypted passwords for sensitive military clients 
breached. Afﬁ liated vandals posted a Twitter message from Fox News falsely 
stating that President Obama had been shot.
The variety of targets, and the apparently whimsical motivations for 
their inclusion, aligns with a leaderless collective; the agenda is oppor-
tunistic, though the skills involved in the military breaches suggest that 
some members possess sophisticated knowledge. At the same time, the 
range of targets and the scale of the breaches suggest a deeper problem: 
Information security is not being well practiced. While hacking for the 
laughs out loud (LulzSec) appears apolitical, other actions exhibit some 
degree of geopolitical awareness: Certain NATO documents were kept 
quiet, and other materials that might have compromised the News of the 
World newspaper scandal investigation in England were also claimed 
to be withheld. Arrests may impair the group’s efforts, but Anonymous 
claims to be an idea rather than an organization:
Your threats to arrest us are meaningless to us as you cannot 
arrest an idea. Any attempt to do so will make your citizens more 
angry until they will roar in one gigantic choir. It is our mission 
to help these people and there is nothing—absolutely nothing—you 
can possibly to do make us stop.19

Emerging Offensive Weapons
Given that an estimated 2,000 U.S. companies (that aren’t talking about 
it very much) have been attacked by various Web assaults of sufﬁ ciently 
high degrees of sophistication to rule out so-called script kiddies looking 
mostly for bragging rights, countermeasures are increasing in intensity.20 
Google, for example, openly accused China of cyberattacks and changed 
its operating procedures in response. The security vendor RSA had the algo-
rithm behind SecureID tokens stolen; 40 million of the key-fob-size devices 
have been shipped to serve as a third factor of authentication for secure 
systems. The defense contractor Lockheed Martin had to shut off its virtual 
private network until new tokens with uncorrupted “seeds” that generate a 
fresh six-digit number every 60 seconds could be distributed.21 For a global 
company with sensitive data, such a scenario was troubling indeed.
So far, targets have been both civilian, including defense contractors, 
and military: 24,000 ﬁ les were stolen in March 2011 from an unnamed 
contractor by “foreign intruders.”22 The new class of targets are strategic, 
outside the military and diplomatic sphere: power grids, drawbridges, hos-
pital monitoring, and patient-care systems. While defensive measures are 
essential and sometimes effective, nation-states seek to arm themselves 
offensively. As the Stuxnet virus showed, software attacks can be strate-
gically effective while being politically palatable, given the considerable 
legal gray area.
But where does a government buy the ability to shut down Moscow’s 
subways, for example, or turn oil reﬁ neries in a given rogue nation into 
chaos? A new generation of software company, operating very quietly, 
is emerging to do for paying governments what skilled coders can be 
recruited to do in less democratic societies. Such companies as KEYW, 
Endgame Systems, and HBGary Federal map vulnerabilities and offer soft-
ware assets for sale: What kind of computers are running where, doing 
what, relative to a target? How can those computers be protected, com-
promised, disabled, or simply monitored? For about $6 million, reportedly, 
a buyer gets what one article called “cyber warfare in a box.”23 Seeing 
the market, IBM bought Internet Security Systems (ISS) for $1.3 bil-
lion in 2006. One of ISS’s key differentiators was the X-Force network- 
vulnerability mapping service; Endgame’s founders were X-Force alumni.
Unlike the Cold War’s reliance on deterrence—we know what you 
have and, if you utilize it, we will pay you back—cyberwar is marked by 
high degrees of misdirection and deniability. In addition, once a capabil-
ity is shown, countermeasures can be taken in ways that were impossible 
with nuclear warheads, for instance: A cyberweapon has a shorter shelf 
life after being deployed than when it is secret. With Stuxnet, the software 
covered its tracks and told nuclear facility operators the centrifuges were

operating normally when in fact they were spinning fast enough to destroy 
themselves, but now that it is known, the virus no longer can be used in a 
surprise attack.24
Such software could be written in only a handful of countries, but 
given the ease of triggering a virus or even an army of dormant com-
promised computers as compared to moving nuclear warheads across 
the world, cyberwarfare will not follow the pattern of exclusivity that 
was the hallmark of the nuclear club of known or strongly suspected 
regimes. To illustrate the complexity of the situation, consider the ori-
gin of the price list for vulnerability mapping, rootkits*, and even e-mail 
and Web addresses. In such a sensitive domain, how did Endgame’s 
wares ﬁ nd their way into unclassiﬁ ed, public sources? An outside party 
hacked into HBGary Federal in 2011 and leaked the relevant e-mails. 
Who was that party? Anonymous, the hacker alliance that has no known 
geographical headquarters, appointed leader, or physical infrastructure: 
The group’s publicity tools include press releases and YouTube videos, 
which can be close to untraceable, but otherwise it works pretty much 
invisibly.
Looking Ahead
Cyberwar, in short, differs from conventional warfare in just about every 
signiﬁ cant dimension:
 
 The attacker can be thousands of miles away from the target, and the 
attack can be timed to launch weeks or months after the decision is 
made.
 
 The identity and location of the attacker can be virtually impossible to 
determine.
 
 The attacking parties’ motivation can be invisible, ad hoc, or highly 
developed, and different aligned parties likely will be acting in the 
service of different agendas.
 
 Some participants may be unaware of the existence or nature of their 
participation.
*A rootkit is a collection of software tools that give an individual administrator-
level access (“root,” as in the root directory) to a computer. Access usually comes 
from either a known vulnerability or intercepting or otherwise compromising a 
password. After the rootkit is installed, an attacker can mask his or her intrusion 
and commandeer the basic operations of the computer or network.

 The identity of the attacker can be hidden to make it look like the 
work of someone else or the work of no one in particular.
 
 The ultimate target may not be immediately obvious, given the dense 
interconnection of so many computers.
 
 The intent may be to deprive the target’s host of a capability, to send 
a political message, to cause economic disruption, or to cause bodily 
harm, either speciﬁ cally (a particular pacemaker or insulin-delivery 
pump) or generally (a water supply). In short, cyberattacks can be 
very speciﬁ cally aimed.
 
 Cyberattacks cost far less to mount than conventional attacks.
 
 For many reasons, targets are readily available: Few assets are com-
pletely secure.
As the number of Internet connections and computerlike devices 
ascends past the 4 billion mark, thinking about such notions as authentica-
tion, perimeter security, and trust will be increasingly problematic. If the 
risks get severe enough, might the many beneﬁ ts of interconnection and 
mobility be overwhelmed by the dangers, or by the precautions25 insisted 
on by those charged with the protection of critical assets? That is, will the 
behaviors of the cyberwarriors, both ofﬁ cial and unaligned, force substan-
tial changes in the open, relatively low-cost, and heterogeneous environ-
ment people have come to expect?

CHAPTER 35
Innovation
“Innovation” is a word that veers into the realm of motherhood and apple pie: It’s good 
because it’s good. If innovation is in fact essential to the American future, however, it 
must move beyond personal idiosyncrasy, magic, and luck. Merely because innovation 
does not result from relatively rote application of algorithms does not mean it cannot 
be learned, measured, or codiﬁ ed. Two examples, among many others, may serve as 
inspiration going forward.
Amazon
After more than 15 years on the Web, Amazon.com remains a pioneer in 
online commerce. From the days when its peers were E*TRADE and Dell, 
then through the periods of iPod and Google ascendency, Amazon is the 
one company that can claim a consistent leadership position on the Web. 
It serves as an information-age exemplar because of its combination of 
innovation and execution, and especially its mastery of platform econom-
ics. Today, Amazon continues to help deﬁ ne the Internet as a consumer 
environment, with rules, limits, and opportunities often different from those 
experienced in physical channels. Operating under assumptions at variance 
with conventional businesses, and a survivor of the 2000 dot-com bubble, 
Amazon is a harbinger of successful business practices in a connected 
economy. (See Figure 35.1.)
Amazon.com opened for business in July 1995 as an exclusively 
Internet-based effort. After books, Amazon initially expanded into books 
on tape, videotapes, and sheet music. It then moved into compact discs, 
becoming the top Internet music merchant in its ﬁ rst quarter of opera-
tion. In late November 1998, Amazon announced that it was temporarily

expanding into holiday gifts, including electronics, toys, gadgets, and 
games. This move, while expected, came earlier than most observers pre-
dicted, providing another instance where Amazon acted proactively and 
forced other industry players to respond. Such expansion established a 
pattern that has persisted: Amazon moves unexpectedly and faster than 
conventional wisdom would dictate. More than once, actions that were 
judged as rash in the investment and business press—such as moving 
into tools and hardware, or the Amazon Prime prepaid two-day shipping 
plan—turned out to be successful.
The business was started by Jeff Bezos, who studied computer sci-
ence and electrical engineering at Princeton before working in investment 
banking until 1994. His interest in the Internet as a consumer environment 
began when he saw the growth rate of World Wide Web trafﬁ c in the 
spring of 1994. As Bezos recalled in an interview:
I came across a statistic that the growth rate of Web usage 
was 2,300 percent a year. . . .   It turned out that, though you 
couldn’t measure the baseline usage, you could measure growth 
rate. And things rarely grow that quickly. . . .   Just anecdotally, 
I could tell that the baseline was nontrivial. And therefore it 
looked like the Web was going to get very big very fast.1

Bezo’s immediate business goal—“Get big fast”2—reﬂ ects an under-
standing of power-law economics, the driving force in the software indus-
try that is Amazon’s main progenitor. Indeed, the story of how Bezos 
came to choose books as his domain has become part of Internet folklore. 
In the summer of 1994, he intensively researched different products to sell 
online, then chose books from among 20 different candidates. He and his 
wife moved to Seattle in part to capitalize on the area’s large supply of tal-
ented computer programmers and focused on the opportunities presented 
by the fact of books being information goods, by the fragmentation of 
both supply and demand, and by the demanding inventory needs of a 
book retailer being easier to meet with connections to distributors’ ware-
houses than with in-house stock. In his analysis, Bezos anticipated Chris 
Anderson’s insight into the long tail of power-law distributions: Vast selec-
tion meeting sparse demand in an online marketplace is a formula that 
deﬁ nes multiple sectors that Amazon has entered.
It is important to note that, from the outset, Amazon operated on a 
business model built to exploit the online environment rather than from 
the standpoint of a product focus. This perspective directly contradicts 
conventional business wisdom that urges executives to set business goals 
and then to “enable” those goals with technology. Bezos, like FedEx’s 
Fred Smith and other visionaries, instead studied a set of emerging techno-
logical capabilities and wrapped a business around them.
How Amazon Delivers Value
Amazon has consciously built a fourfold value proposition, each dimen-
sion of which directly relates to an understanding of the leverage uniquely 
generated by the online medium:3
 1. Convenience. The Internet is open for business all the time, across 
time zones. The Amazon Web site offers multiple paths to a given 
item: via reviews, categorical browsing lists, multiple dimensions of 
search capability, referral from a previous search, e-mail notiﬁ cation, a 
variety of recommendation engines, or personalized messages on the 
Web interface. The Web site is designed to minimize download time, 
and the mobile applications are similarly user-centric. (While the site 
was initially designed for home shoppers, before mass broadband was 
deployed Amazon would log signiﬁ cant trafﬁ c bursts at lunch hour 
as customers connected over their employers’ corporate networks). 
Through its alliance with Sprint, Amazon can nearly instantly down-
load a Kindle book anywhere there is a Wi-Fi or Sprint cellular signal.
 2. Selection. No matter what the retail category, Amazon delivers 
unprecedented selection: New and used items, physical and virtual

Innovation
information goods (book, movie, and music downloads), and inter-
national presence begin a list of ways in which Amazon has rede-
ﬁ ned retail. The virtualization of inventory—afﬁ liates hold many 
stock- keeping units (SKUs), reducing Amazon’s risk while deliver-
ing  selection—was pioneered early in the company’s history, then 
expanded. Table 35.1 shows the scale of the selection advantage com-
pared to category leaders.
 3. Price. Amazon owns inventory for a much shorter time than phys-
ical retailers. As a result, Amazon can sell for less because it is on 
the right side of debt interest (see below). Labor contributes less to 
selling price: Amazon’s revenue per employee is more than $1 mil-
lion versus roughly $200,000 for Target. Even with shipping added to 
an order under $25 (which many shoppers mentally discount as the 
cost of convenience), Amazon comes out to be roughly 8% to 15% 
cheaper than a physical retailer, in large measure because it aggres-
sively avoids exposure to sales tax.
 4. Customer service. Amazon has a call center but keeps the phone num-
ber well hidden. Customers are trained to self-service their accounts 
online, and the company’s customer service metrics are exceptionally 
high even with the lack of human touch. The company’s network of 
warehouses sets the industry standard for fast delivery, even with the 
large SKU count.
Execution
Amazon’s extraordinary performance on some traditional measurements 
indicates some beneﬁ ts of its business model. The foremost of these 
may be cash ﬂ ow: Amazon’s operating cycle—the time from payment to 
suppliers until payment from customers—is in fact negative. Given that 
credit card companies typically pay Amazon within 24 hours of an order’s

receipt, and given that Amazon pays its suppliers 46 days after receipt of 
goods, the ﬁ rm has use of the customers’ money for several weeks before 
bills come due. At Best Buy, in contrast, inventory is held, on average, for 
74 days, or 30 days after the supplier was paid.
Other metrics are similarly revealing of best-in-class execution:
 
 Amazon scores extremely high grades on the American Customer 
Satisfaction Index, not just in its sector but compared to many busi-
ness categories.4 Other rankings, including those from ForeSee5 and 
BIGresearch,6 also rank Amazon on top.
 
 The customer base is in the range of 75 million people, with offerings 
customized for each individual who logs in.
 
 Google has indexed more that 107 million Amazon pages, which pro-
vides a rough estimate of SKU count. Because those pages are heavily 
viewed, Google ranks them highly in core search results, meaning that 
Amazon needs to spend less on paid search advertising.
 
 Amazon processes 24 orders per second.7
 
 Eighty-one million people visit per month, ranking Amazon in the top 
20 of Web destinations worldwide.
Innovation
In keeping with the hypothesis that superb execution is necessary but no 
longer sufﬁ cient for business success, Amazon (like Apple) excels at inno-
vation. The ﬁ rm is responsible for several developments that are now part 
of the online landscape:
 
 From early in the company’s history, Amazon has utilized user- 
generated content in the form of product reviews and reviews of the 
reviews. Amazon, in short, utilized social media before anyone called 
it that.
 
 In addition to user recommendations, Amazon helped customers navi-
gate its large product selection with specialized search (after its A9 
service did not dent Google in head-to-head competition in 2005) as 
well as collaborative ﬁ ltering of the sort used at Netﬂ ix: People who 
liked this item also liked that one. All three forms of navigation are 
essential to making long-tail product selection work.
 
 The shopping-cart metaphor and one-click shopping both came from 
Amazon.
 
 Opening up Amazon’s distribution network to competitors or merely 
third parties of any sort turned Amazon from a store into a commerce 
platform.

Innovation
 
 Turning its expertise with Web-based customer service and very large 
data centers into a proﬁ t center, Amazon made another platform play 
with Amazon Web Services, a pioneering cloud computing offering.
 
 While Amazon has digitized many forms of media (including music 
and television), its Kindle book platform is reinventing the entire pub-
lishing industry. Physical bookstores, publishers, and authors all ﬁ nd 
themselves reacting to Amazon’s Kindle moves. In late 2011, Amazon 
expanded from e-readers into tablets, with the intent of tightening the 
link to the shopping experience rather than confronting the Apple 
iPad as a general-purpose device.
 
 Amazon is reinventing the publishing value chain, integrating most 
every function from writer acquisition, self-publishing, branding (for 
example signing the self-help author Timothy Ferriss to Amazon’s 
own Imprint, bypassing the conventional publisher’s role), print-on-
demand, and audiobook publishing as well as used-book selling.
 
 Amazon pioneered the Gold Box, the predecessor of one-deal-at-a-
time sites such as Gilt Groupe and woot!
 
 In 2005, Amazon launched Prime, its prepaid free two-day shipping 
membership.
 
 The Amazon smartphone app, including instantaneous bar-code 
scanning, helped lead the way to hybrid local–mobile commerce. 
One form of this model essentially turns any physical retailer into an 
Amazon showroom.
Lessons from Amazon
Given its long history, its large scale, its inability to be categorized, and 
its operational excellence, Amazon is a hard company to copy. That said, 
four lessons may be applicable in other efforts:
 1. Focus on the customer. Amazon’s share price has been volatile in part 
because the company is not afraid of big bets (whether in warehouse 
networks, server farms, or now hardware device development). The 
company is also hard for analysts to value because it has no peers that 
share its key operational components. Thus, rather than managing to 
Wall Street expectations, Amazon manages to customer behavior.
 2. Identify inefﬁ ciencies, then invent ways to reduce or eliminate them. 
Nowhere is this truer than in Amazon’s redeﬁ nition of book publish-
ing. Several layers of intermediaries ﬁ nd themselves cut out of the 
extended Kindle ecosystem.
 3. Try things, collect data, and adjust. Amazon relentlessly innovates. 
Not every experiment pays off, as when the site presented variable 
prices for DVDs in 2000.8 The tabbed model for different product

departments did not scale well, so the site was redesigned to put 
more emphasis on customization for the individual shopper than on 
the store’s many product categories. The Kindle reader has evolved 
rather than being assumed to be perfect upon release: Other compa-
nies put usability issues on the customer whereas Amazon continually 
tweaks, monitors, and alters.
 4. Watch the platform. Amazon’s logistics system, opened to afﬁ liates 
from an early date in the company’s history, is one platform. Cloud 
computing is another. The reading Kindle is a third major platform, 
with the color Kindle Fire potentially a fourth. Going forward, Amazon 
(which already offers a credit card) could move into mobile payments. 
The merchant could expand its footprint in digital media. The point is 
that platform plays require entrepreneurial initiative, deep pockets, a 
wide web of relationships, and an engaged customer base. Amazon 
has all of the above. As winners from IBM, Microsoft, and Google have 
shown, the stakes of platform plays can be lucrative indeed. There is 
little reason to doubt Amazon’s chances of extending its track record.
Crowds
The Internet, particularly its mobile variant, dramatically lowers coor-
dination costs, as we have seen repeatedly. The possibilities for crowds 
to mobilize to solve problems are multiplying, providing a second rich 
resource for innovation.
Tools
Several examples might point the way to other possibilities.
 
 InnoCentive utilizes a challenge model to pose hard problems to 
groups of people who, often from different disciplinary perspectives, 
contribute insights. Sponsor companies pay only for results. On top 
of money, participants get the intrinsic rewards of being self-directed, 
creative, and recognized for making a difference.
 
 As we saw in Chapter 11, Foldit turns protein folding into an online 
game and has begun to crack long-standing scientiﬁ c problems.
 
 A key stage in innovation is need identiﬁ cation. With geographic 
mapping tools such as Ushahidi (see Chapter 12), London Potholes 
(http://yourpotholes.crowdmap.com/), or Safecast (which tracks 
Japan’s radiation levels), ground truth is easier to obtain.
 
 Using tools of mass sentiment, including Facebook and Twitter, as 
well as Google Trends (see Figure 35.2), mass behavior can be mined

Innovation
to generate insight on needs, if not to generate solutions. The analyt-
ics and visualization tools noted in Chapters 29 and 30 are highly rel-
evant here.
Video
To illustrate a different angle on the crowd dynamic, I’d like to discuss a 
video by TED producer Chris Anderson.9 In it he looks at the proliferation 
of online videos as tools for mass learning and improvement. Starting with 
the example of self-taught street dancers in Brazil, Japan, Los Angeles, and 
elsewhere, he argues that the broad availability of video as shared show-
and-tell mechanism spurs one-upmanship through imitation and then 
innovation. The level of TED talks themselves, Anderson argues, provides 
home-grown evidence that cheap, vivid multimedia can raise the bar for 
many kinds of tasks: futurist presentations, basketball dunks, surgical tech-
niques, and so on.
Five factors relative to usability are important in the case of Web video 
being radically accessible.
 1. The low barrier to entry for imitator/innovator #2 to post her contri-
bution to the discussion may inspire, inform, or infuriate imitator/
innovator #3. Mass media did some of these things (in athletic moves, 
for example: Watch a playground the week after the Super Bowl or 
a halfpipe after the X games). The lack of a feedback loop, however, 
limited the power of broadcast to propagate secondary and tertiary 
contributions.
 2. Web video moves incredibly fast. The speed of new ideas entering the 
ﬂ ow can be staggering once a video goes viral, as its epidemiological 
metaphor would suggest.

 3. The incredible diversity of the online world is increasing every year, 
so the sources of new ideas, fresh thinking, and knowledge of existing 
solutions multiply as well. Credentials are self-generated rather than 
externally conferred: A dance video gets views not because its creator 
went to Julliard but because people ﬁ nd it compelling and tell their 
friends, followers, or colleagues.
 4. Web video is itself embedded in a host of other tools, both social and 
technical, that are also incredibly easy to use. Do you want to tell 
someone across the country about an article in today’s paper newspa-
per? Get out the scissors, ﬁ nd an envelope, dig up his current address, 
ﬁ gure out correct postage (pop quiz: how much is a ﬁ rst-class stamp 
today?), get to a mailbox, and wait a few days. Want to recommend 
a YouTube or other Web video? There are literally hundreds of tools 
for doing so, essentially all of which are free and have short learning 
curves.
 5. Feedback is immediate, in the form of both comments and views coun-
ters. The reputational currency that attaches to a “Charlie bit my ﬁ nger” 
or “Evolution of dance” is often (but not always) nonmonetary, to be 
sure, but emotionally extremely affecting nonetheless.
With such powerful motivators, low barriers to participation, vast and 
diverse populations, rapidity of both generation and diffusion, and a rich 
ancillary toolset relating to online video, Anderson makes a compelling 
case for the medium as a vast untapped resource for problem solving on 
multiple fronts. In addition, because video involves multiple senses, the 
odds that a given person will grasp my ideas increases as the viewer can 
hear, watch, or read text relating to the topic. In the face of an urgent 
need to innovate, the tool set is, fortunately, powerful and accessible.
Looking Ahead
Innovation has never been more needed—one study suggests that innova-
tion per capita peaked well over 100 years ago—or more possible. Open 
platforms, starting with the Web itself, allow the harvesting of more effort. 
Wireless hardware puts tools in the hands of millions more people every 
year. Distributed sensors, radios, and geographic information can be clev-
erly combined in ways never before possible. Perhaps most important, 
harvesting the “people power” of good questions, good ideas, and good 
challenges recalibrates the investment model of many categories of innova-
tion. As the MIT response to the DARPA balloon challenge illustrated (see 
Chapter 3), getting the incentive model right to drive the right people to 
participate was more important than any algorithm or piece of code.

CHAPTER 36
Information, Technology, 
and Innovation
The implications of such a massive transformation are obviously impossible to cata-
log, much less predict. What follows are some selected areas of business impact 
resulting from the shifts in the computing, communications, and social infrastructure 
over the past 20 years or so.
Macro Issues
Business will continue to come in multiple shapes and sizes, and the diver-
sity is important to recognize: Construction or agriculture will always behave 
differently from banking or health care, but, nevertheless, each sector will 
see instances of what Carlota Perez described as “synergy” in Chapter 1. The 
speed of innovation, adoption, and transformation of technologies by their 
users will continue to accelerate, and, as we have seen, retail might now 
be facing what music confronted more than a decade ago: a sea of change 
in customer expectation and behavior with far-reaching consequences for 
the entire industry.
That said, there are three developments to watch.
 1. Mobile payments are a logical consequence of rapid smartphone deploy-
ment. Smartphone penetration in the United States is at 33% in 2011, 
up from 20% in 2010. Making the smartphone into a wallet (as in 
Japan) or a bank branch (as in Kenya) is possible, but the question is 
whether the technology solves a problem that isn’t a problem: Credit 
cards have a broad installed base in the United States, and a smartphone

Information, Technology, and Innovation 
is more easily lost. Merchants might be hesitant to install more termi-
nals after already paying handsomely for the current device. That said, 
other countries might see different patterns of adoption, as was the 
case with text messaging prior to 2005.
 2. Business will become more “social.” Well beyond putting up a Facebook 
“like” button, companies will be faced with workers, recruits, part-
ners, and customers who seek more nuanced interactions than are 
typically provided by a Web site or toll-free call center. Whether it 
is collaboration to solve a problem, genuine excitement over some 
happy outcome, prepurchase or preemployment research, or concern 
over product safety, people want to interact in rich, rapid, personalized 
ways. This might involve product promotion (Groupon), way-ﬁ nding 
(Foursquare), social networking (Facebook Places), or other forms of 
involvement (Kickstarter or Shopkick). The trend toward social com-
merce often takes the form of games, and we can expect this tendency 
to become more pronounced.
 3. Innovation will be a competitive requirement in more and more sec-
tors. Whether it is the evolution of microﬁ nancing and peer-to-peer 
lending in ﬁ nancial services, person-to-person coordination for over-
night stays (Airbnb), or something as simple yet powerful as Craigslist, 
established entities can no longer assume the same barriers to entry 
from previous decades will continue to be effective.
Globalization
While it’s difﬁ cult to quantify globalization, the fact that there will soon 
be 4 billion mobile phones in circulation points to a more connected 
future for every country, save the occasional North Korea or Somalian 
 exception—and in Somalia, the pirates are equipped with an impressive 
information infrastructure, so the connection is of a different sort.1 As 
we have seen, the creative uses of the technology for good and for ill 
are most impressive, and as learning spreads faster on that infrastructure, 
the cycle of experimentation, innovation, and diffusion will only get faster. 
Consider that the iPhone was launched in the United States in 2007 and 
promptly redeﬁ ned the technology landscape; by 2011, it was available 
in 105 countries and looks to become popular among China’s 700 million 
mobile phone subscribers now that Apple has distribution partners. This 
speed is completely unprecedented.
It’s also useful to bear in mind the differences in adoption patterns: 
The mobile phones that are transforming life in Africa, for example, are 
not doing so with Angry Birds or Facebook but with election fraud moni-
toring, medical innovations, and banking. At the same time, in the devel-
oped world, those “serious” applications have enormous potential even

Strategy 
373
while entertainment, “grooming” (ﬂ irting), and social coordination remain 
important.
A ﬁ nal facet of globalization relates to evolving notions of property 
rights. When intellectual property, such as songs, movies, and books, 
can be digitally copied and distributed globally for little cost, maintaining 
property rights obviously becomes problematic. As we saw with regard to 
copy protection in Chapter 4, technologically locking down bits in soft-
ware form has yet to be a long-term solution: People working in pursuit 
of a shared (possibly illegal) objective can coordinate too easily, and the 
Internet is too good at moving bits for this to be viable.
An alternative conception of property rights helps Linux work. The 
General Public License (GPL) is the license protocol that ensures that any pro-
grammer’s contribution to the software will be recognized as building on the 
free software with which he or she began. That is, unlike other free software 
licenses (such as Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD)), the GPL ensures that 
the free software that is modiﬁ ed cannot have more restrictive conditions 
imposed as it is redistributed after the changes are contributed. The notion is 
known as copyleft, or the opposite of copyright in that it protects the freedom 
of the artifact and the freedom of programmers to add to the code base rather 
than the property rights of a person or commercial entity.2
Wikipedia uses similar licensing. The result is a substantial public 
commons that is legally protected from commercial exploitation: People 
who contribute to a free public good know it will remain free and public 
and not get commercialized for private gain. At global scale, for certain 
kinds of goods, this kind of licensing encourages innovation, as Ushahidi 
(Chapter 12) shows. At the same time, it gives people in developing coun-
tries an alternative to the license fees collected by an Apple or Microsoft. 
Copyleft does not work very well for private goods, however, so the issue 
of maintaining property rights to movies, for example, remains difﬁ cult, 
especially given the size of the markets involved.
Strategy
While the ﬁ rm remains a key element in strategic thinking, larger and 
more ﬂ uid entities are also increasing in importance. Technology plat-
forms, human and organizational networks, and even coordinated individ-
uals without corporate identity can alter the strategic landscape.
Platforms
Perhaps more than other industry, the computing and communications sec-
tor is characterized not only by product or brand competition (Ford ver-
sus Toyota or Pepsi versus Coke) but by platform competition. Platforms

imply standards, often-complex ecosystems of suppliers, inﬂ uencers, con-
tent partners, and third-party software developers. Microsoft won one 
round of platform competition in the 1990s, to be sure, but today the pri-
mary contenders appear to be Apple and Google (including allies such as 
HTC and Motorola) in smartphones, with Nokia and Microsoft a poten-
tially interesting combination. Google dominates search-related advertis-
ing; Facebook is similarly strong in demographically targeted display ads. 
SAP and Oracle control the majority of enterprise software, with various 
open-source options getting more plausible every year. HP and IBM con-
trol a substantial portion of infrastructure, but “platform as a service” cloud 
vendors, including Amazon, are rewriting the entire book on data centers. 
Facebook’s surge in revenue coincided with the popularity of social gam-
ing supported by the likes of Zynga, the company behind FarmVille and 
other popular titles. One estimate from the University of Maryland pegs the 
Facebook app ecosystem employment at roughly 150,000 people, drawing 
about $15 billion in wages.3
In each of these cases, there is no winner of market share differenti-
ated only by price or performance. Instead, the number of existing users 
leads to network effects that can be decisively high, as at Facebook (com-
pared to MySpace in particular). Apple’s quality of design and user experi-
ence matter, to be sure, but Google’s Android platform, while notably less 
elegant, has more users. Instead, the customer weighs the totality of the sys-
tem, which can include many other entities outside the primary vendor. This 
breadth and dynamism means that platform builders must walk the ﬁ ne line 
between deﬁ ning a coherent vision and not locking down the potential for 
the market to take the platform in new directions. Apple did not design the 
iPad as a teaching tool for children with autism, for example, but it excels 
in that role thanks to some clever applications expertly designed by people 
addressing those particular needs.
One way of thinking about this platform dynamic is a shift in emphasis 
from nodes (centers of mass, or assets) to links: connections. The force driv-
ing that transformation is the growth of networks—superﬁ cially, digital data 
conduits and, more crucially, the new possibilities for human connection 
that ride on those links. Networks and their implications have historically 
overturned existing rules of business strategy, whether the network was 
comprised of ships (England), wires (AT&T), or distribution centers (Wal-
Mart). In each of these historical revolutions, the deﬁ nitions of who was 
competing, what they were competing for, and what constituted an advan-
tage shifted in ways that rendered many conventional strategic choices inef-
fective or even dangerous. We are at another such juncture today.
Consider an example of one way networks alter strategy. Just as al 
Qaeda has no intention of invading New York, neither does BitTorrent 
seek to become a record label or movie studio. In such unconventional

confrontations, the insurgent doesn’t want what the incumbent wants—
market share, proﬁ tability, or whatever—but its goals may impede or deny 
the corporate pursuit of these goals. This particular asymmetry of objec-
tives makes business strategy much harder to set; once an actor no longer 
contends with an outside party with either identical or mirror-image objec-
tives, deﬁ nitions of success and failure can become much more difﬁ cult to 
identify or counter.
Listening to the Warriors
As business strategy in the past has borrowed from military strategy for 
insight, we can beneﬁ t from current thinking about ﬁ ghting new kinds 
of adversaries. In an article in the Washington Post, defense analyst John 
Arquilla put matters succinctly. “It takes a tank to ﬁ ght a tank. It takes a 
network to ﬁ ght a network,” he said, quoting his own book, In Athena’s 
Camp.4 That book, cowritten with David Ronfeldt, makes several compel-
ling arguments about what the editors call “netwar,” a ﬁ ght among net-
worked components. Signiﬁ cantly, this is not necessarily fought on the 
Internet; that notion they usefully distinguish as “cyberwar.” The entire con-
cept of netwar carries directly into the ﬁ eld of business strategy, helping 
deﬁ ne new guidelines for achieving advantage in a networked environment.
When Arquilla and Ronfeldt speak of the great powers and say “Look 
around. No ‘good old-fashioned war is in sight,’”5 they could easily be 
describing key aspects of the corporate landscape. While geopolitical 
combat can pit nonstate actors (whether nongovernmental organizations, 
religious sects, or terrorist organizations) against nation-states, businesses 
confront constraints from such noncorporate entities as AARP, Napster and 
then Grokster, and Linux, not to mention governments in their standard-
setting and regulatory capacities. Arquilla and Ronfeldt point out that in 
these types of conﬂ ict, “disruption may often be the intended strategic aim 
rather than destruction.”6
Summing up, Arquilla and Ronfeldt contrast chess, the old strategy 
archetype, with Go, a fascinating emblem of the new (at least in the West). 
Go, they assert,
is more about distributing one’s pieces than massing them. . . . 
 It is more about developing web-like links among nearby station-
ary pieces than about moving specialized pieces in combined 
operations. It is more about creating networks of pieces than about 
protecting hierarchies of pieces.7
This extended analogy serves nicely as a thought exercise for aspiring 
network strategists. Corporate strategy has often been a pursuit of mass,

an exercise premised on given rather than malleable industry structure, an 
exercise in vertical integration rather than horizontal connection. As our 
networks reach deeper and future innovations take increasing advantage 
of the dominant network models, we will see more and more business 
dynamics that, for better and worse, parallel what we are seeing as a new 
chapter in military strategy.
One Path from Military Strategy to Business Management
To understand the contours of classic business strategy, it is helpful to 
discern its western military heritage: Competitors are seen as enemies 
and the marketplace is typically a battleground. The similarities are 
more than rhetorical. Modern business strategy’s kinship with military 
theory dates primarily to the mid-nineteenth century, when a cadre of 
graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point came into posi-
tions of authority. West Point trained the ﬁ rst of America’s engineers, 
who went on to design such key infrastructure as railroad bridges in 
the Civil War. The ability to impose one’s will across time and dis-
tance required lines of authority and communication that transcended 
physical proximity. The West Point training emphasized the impor-
tance of written orders, similar to business memoranda. Later, war vet-
erans played key roles in the growth of commercial railroads, which 
employed the engineering point of view both in how they operated 
and, more subtly, in the organizational design necessitated by the ﬁ rst 
distributed, coordinated national enterprises.
What are the key tenets of classic business strategy that emerged 
from these military origins? In its simplest form, an organization or 
military operation should resemble a pyramid: Power and intelligence 
are concentrated at the top and trickle down to the wide bottom of 
the hierarchy, where both power and intelligence are presumed to 
be minimal. The ultimate goal is the familiar “command and control,” 
which necessitates getting subordinates to do what you want while 
preventing them from doing what you don’t. The obvious drawback to 
such an objective is the chaotic nature of combat, the aptly named fog 
of war that limits commanders’ knowledge of cause and effect as well 
as their ability to either command or control distributed, self-organized 
(and to some degree self-interested) forces.
By the 1990s, military strategists like U.S. Marine Lieutenant 
General Paul K. Van Riper became aware that this advantaged posi-
tion mentality would not serve in the new battleﬁ eld. No longer was

Strategy 
377
Challenging Porter
Today, one still hears echoes of old military thinking in the work of busi-
ness strategists like Michael Porter, whose body of work dominates MBA 
curricula and strategy consulting methodologies alike. Porter explores the 
ways in which proper corporate strategy defends advantageous business 
positions. Although this classic perspective holds some valuable lessons, 
Porter’s strategic orientation misses the explosive dynamics typical of net-
work behavior. His new theory of shared value, meanwhile, has yet to 
take hold with the power of the still-canonical ﬁ ve forces, which have 
held sway since 1979.8
Strategic thinking, in his formulation, occurs within a context of these 
forces: those exerted by customers, suppliers, competitors, potential com-
petitors, and product substitutes. Several events of the past decade, how-
ever, challenge that perspective. It was particularly easy in 1999 to say that 
networks change everything, and Porter (in a March 2001 article in Harvard 
Business Review) was correct to assert that overenthusiasm led some managers 
and investors to forget the basics that don’t change, proﬁ ts being foremost. 
his the rhetoric of command and control; instead, Van Riper granted 
that “warfare is uncontrollable once you unleash it, so the best you 
can do is control your use of force within the phenomenon itself.” The 
new battleﬁ elds of war and work were more ﬂ uid, dynamic, and inter-
connected, and thus called for new strategic agility. “Commander’s 
intent”—what needed to be done—came from the top; plans of 
action—how to do it—were now left to units closest to the action. 
Pyramids were out; natural phenomena like swarms were in. But the 
transition from models to operations was rarely simple. Both military 
and business leaders have learned that networks shape competition in 
complex ways, and devising strategic frameworks to cope with those 
complexities has been far more difﬁ cult than expected.
U.S. military strategy, meanwhile, is being reshaped by multiple forces:
 
 The notion of the “three-block war” in which armed insurgents are 
battled in one city block, peacekeeping is the mission next door, 
while in the third sector, armed forces deliver humanitarian aid
 
 Insurgents who blend in with local populations, as in Afghanistan
 
 The rise in the use and effectiveness of improvised explosive 
devices, often detonated by mobile phones

Information, Technology, and Innovation 
But three examples of networked challenges to existing businesses would 
seem to break Porter’s model and conﬁ rm the disruptive power of the new 
models, particularly ones that deny the ability of corporations to create 
“unique sustainable competitive advantage” through coercive or other forms 
of consumer lock-in.
The three entities are Napster, Linux, and ecoterrorist cells. In each 
case, a networked entity is not competitor, or supplier, or customer. Even 
so, the entity poses a formidable challenge to incumbents’ deﬁ nitions of 
business as usual. These entities fail to respond to conventional interven-
tions, such as price cuts, market exit, or merger and acquisition activity. 
Further, none of the three entities is a business, and as such none plays by 
the same rules as businesses. The disrupters are something more signiﬁ -
cant than competitors, insofar as they don’t threaten market share as much 
as they challenge the foundational assumptions of an entire economic (and 
often social or cultural) sector. Networks have the potential not only to 
compete with ﬁ rms but to transform entire markets that constituent ﬁ rms 
take largely as given.
The facts of the music industry are for the most part well known: 
Napster grew to 20 million users in about a year, the sum of whom down-
loaded the equivalent of 1.5 to 2 times the entire U.S. volume of com-
pact discs sold in 2000. Napster was not conceived as a business but as 
a guerilla technology, so it did not need to proﬁ t to succeed. At the same 
time, neither did it treat the existing music industry with much respect. 
The incumbents used their lobbying power to render Napster illegal, and 
it effectively ceased operations in 2001. It’s noteworthy that, contrary to 
the labels’ complaints, CD sales in fact decreased after the service was shut 
down by court order. Porter’s landscape has no place for Napster in the 
music industry, and his advocacy of lock-in tactics was confronted by an 
open network that explicitly denied the industry’s right to charge upward 
of $12 to $15 for a collection of songs when only one was going to be 
played.
Linux is built by a much smaller online community of thousands of 
technologists, but the distribution channel is similar to Napster’s. Even 
though Microsoft lacked full copyright control over someone else’s intel-
lectual property the way record labels did, it responded in much the same 
way as the music industry by trying to brand the operating system and 
the principles it was built on as “un-American.”9 This tactic appeared to 
backﬁ re even as Microsoft was tightening its grip on users through means 
both technical (usually involving Internet Explorer, as when RealNetworks 
sued Microsoft over the use of bundling with Windows Media Player) and 
economic (new enterprise software licensing terms). One mistake might 
be to take a Porterian view of Linux the software distribution as a product 
substitute when in fact Microsoft’s far bigger concern is presumably with

the network of users and developers who connect with each other in a 
completely new way—Linux the idea and network that once again exist 
entirely outside the Porter ﬁ ve forces.
Tom Malone of MIT’s Sloan School nailed the point in his Harvard 
Business Review article. He states that Linux is more than a science-fair 
project of supersmart programmers, more than “a neat Wired magazine 
kind of story:” “This interpretation, while understandable, is shortsighted. 
What the Linux story really shows us is the power of a new technology—
in this case, electronic networks—to fundamentally change the way work 
is done.”10
A ﬁ nal example is a hazy and more troubling one. At the outset, I 
should make clear that I am not applauding this group’s activities but 
rather analyzing the implications of its organization. A band of radi-
cal environmental activists, operating most visibly in America’s Paciﬁ c 
Northwest, utilizes a cell structure to avoid detection and resist inﬁ ltration. 
Each group is autonomous, sharing only broadly deﬁ ned goals within a 
loosely deﬁ ned movement. The groups use a variety of methods, most 
illegal and some life-threatening, to interrupt logging and bioengineering. 
Political insurgents have operated in cells for millennia (the groups in the 
Bible certainly weren’t the ﬁ rst), but what’s new is the Internet’s ability to 
connect today’s groups, and to spread their messages, while preserving 
anonymity. As their Web site states: “The Earth Liberation Front (ELF) is an 
international underground organization that uses direct action in the form 
of economic sabotage to stop the exploitation and destruction of the natu-
ral environment.”11
The ELF is not a group but an extremely loose network. There is no cen-
tralized authority, no membership list, no physical headquarters. Where do 
these groups ﬁ t on, for example, Weyerhaeuser or Boise Cascade’s Porterian 
radar? Rather than competing with these and other timber companies, at their 
most extreme the ELF and similar groups deny the right of the businesses 
even to exist in the ﬁ rst place. What is an appropriate, or even feasible, 
strategic response? Porter’s battleﬁ eld is cleanly deﬁ ned (in large measure 
by a highly visible and fairly rigid industry structure), resembling, as many 
have said, a chess board. The real world is far messier as the ELF and other 
groups move the competition and disruption into culture and politics.
Speaking of the three challenges to Porter, members of the World 
Economic Forum, MBA faculties, and other business-political groups have 
been struggling both to understand and to respond to these new types of 
phenomena that utilize distributed and loosely coupled networks to dis-
rupt and even disable various forms of centralized and tightly deﬁ ned hier-
archies. In conventional economic terms, there is no set model: The ELF 
destroys economic value, Linux creates it, and Napster redistributed it. The 
three examples conﬁ rm that even if it doesn’t change literally everything,

the Internet is redeﬁ ning the competitive landscape in ways that extend far 
beyond what current businesses have had to confront.
Organizations
The ﬁ rm, while still important, is no longer the default model for organiz-
ing resources to get work done. Similarly, the record label and  publishing 
house are challenged by direct-to-market content distribution models. 
As both examples (Wikipedia) and tools (Ushahidi) get better and more 
 recognized, it seems unlikely that organizational innovation will slow. An 
example can be found in Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign: 
Utilizing grassroots fundraising methods building on candidate Howard 
Dean’s 2004 breakthrough, along with social media tools including Web 
video, text messaging, and a Facebook-like MyBarackobama.com infra-
structure, the campaign set records for fundraising and participation. The 
same methods are expected to contribute to the ﬁ rst billion-dollar presi-
dential campaign in 2012.
Regardless of the shape of the organization, today’s tools mean that tal-
ent matters signiﬁ cantly: Even with high unemployment overall, the role of 
difference makers in government, nonproﬁ ts, start-ups, and of course the 
corporate sector relates heavily to the information and technology land-
scapes. Whether it is Apple design chief Jonathan Ive, Wieden+Kennedy 
social media account executive Iain Tait (who spearheaded the Old Spice 
campaign that more than doubled sales), Facebook chief operating ofﬁ cer 
Sheryl Sandberg, or Silicon Valley green technology investor Vinod Khosla, 
talented individuals are in high demand.
New organizational forms are emerging in many sectors.
 
 Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) are basically mobile phone 
companies that rent infrastructure from other parties. Virgin Mobile 
was among the ﬁ rst of these. Bringing a brand but not needing to buy 
wireless spectrum or build networks or billing systems, MVNOs are 
quite common: More than 500 were in operation as of 2011, though 
not all of these will survive. Amazon’s Whispernet distribution service 
on the Kindle reader is an MVNO.
 
 The one-deal-at-a-time retailers we saw in Chapter 21 merge shopping, 
social networking, and entertainment. Supply chains, accounting, mer-
chandising, and customer service all need to be reinvented for such 
companies as Gilt Groupe, Backcountry.com, and Amazon’s woot! unit.
 
 Athletic conferences, professional sports leagues, and select individual 
franchises are reinventing what it means to be a television  network. 
The University of Texas is undertaking the newest experiment in

 revenue-generating content distribution: It signed a $300 million, 
20-year deal with ESPN in 2011.
Marketing
Given the primacy of the traditional four Ps of the ﬁ eld—product, price, 
promotion, and placement—when price goes to zero for several catego-
ries, it’s newsworthy. The music and news industries are visible examples, 
but other industries that formerly capitalized on expertise and relationship 
management have seen the price for those services drop to zero: Ask a 
stockbroker or travel agent about the transition. Maps, online education 
(but not certiﬁ cation), and international voice telephony are other settings 
where up to billions of dollars—in the case of telecoms—of revenue have 
vaporized.
The emergence of free stuff means responding in some industries or 
capitalizing in others. Some musicians have responded to free downloads 
with heavy touring schedules: The Dave Matthews Band earned more than 
$500 million over 10 years on the road.12 Television networks found suc-
cess with Hulu but appear to be unsure what to do with it, given that the 
revenue model does not mirror that of cable networks. Thousands of start-
ups run on Skype; many companies post assembly instruction videos free 
on YouTube; Asus computers uses peer-to-peer networking provided by 
BitTorrent to help distribute software downloads. Free is hard to compete 
with, to be sure, but it presents ample opportunities as well.
Another key marketing dynamic is transparency. As social media 
empowers conversations among customers and between customers and 
a brand, the one-size-ﬁ ts-all model or corporate branding—“Built Ford 
Tough!”—is being joined by a more human dimension in which the cus-
tomers’ voices are incorporated into the brand. The Skittles Web site color 
is dictated by the number of social media mentions, which are incorpo-
rated into the site, along with, at times, user-generated content, such as 
videos. Transparency is tricky, however, since it requires a corporate cul-
ture to show through to the world. Managing this process remains among 
the most challenging aspects of the current environment.
Transparency can also be a ﬂ uke: The U.S. raid that killed Osama 
bin Laden was being tweeted in real time by an information technol-
ogy contractor who wondered why all the helicopters were converging 
on his small, out-of-the-way village. China’s earthquake in 2008 was live on 
Twitter before the U.S. Geological Survey had anything. Apple has had 
photos of iPhone prototypes make their way onto the Web via such sites 
as Gawker, Gizmodo, and the like.

Valuing Global Sports Brands
It’s a familiar business school discussion. “Let’s talk about powerful 
brands,” begins the professor. “Who comes to mind?” Usual suspects 
emerge: Coke, Visa, Kleenex. “OK,” says the prof, “what brand is 
so inﬂ uential that people tattoo it on their arms?” The answer is, of 
course, Harley-Davidson.
There is another category of what we might call “tattoo brands,” 
however: sports teams. Measuring sporting allegiance as a form of 
brand equity is both difﬁ cult and worth thinking about, both because 
sports can be seen as information goods and because technology is 
changing the fan experience.
For a brief deﬁ nition up front, The Economist’s statement will do:
Brand equity is the value of the brand in the marketplace. 
Differentiation demonstrates unique value to customers, and 
how this is communicated is important to building brand 
equity. Brands that have a meaningful point of difference are 
more likely to be chosen repeatedly by consumers and ultimately 
have a much higher potential for growth than do other brands.13
That is, people think more highly of one product than another 
because of such factors as word of mouth, customer satisfaction, 
image creation and management, track record, and a range of tangible 
and intangible beneﬁ ts of using or associating with the product.
Our focus here will be limited to professional sports franchises, 
which generally have three primary revenue streams:
 1. Television rights
 2. Ticket sales and in-stadium advertising
 3. Licensing for shirts, caps, and other memorabilia
Of these, ticket sales are relatively ﬁ nite: A team with a powerful 
brand will presumably have more fans than can logistically or ﬁ nan-
cially attend games. Prices can and do rise, but for a quality franchise, 
the point is to build a fan network beyond the arena. Television is 
traditionally the prime way to do this. National and now global TV 
contracts turn viewership into advertising revenue for partners up and 
down the value chain from the leagues and clubs themselves. That 
Manchester United and the New York Yankees can have fan bases in

China, Japan, or Brazil testiﬁ es to the power of television and, increas-
ingly, various facets of the Internet in brand building. Twitter is a 
prime example.
Sports 
fandom 
exhibits 
peculiar 
economic 
characteristics. 
Compared to, say, house or car buying, fans do not research vari-
ous alternatives before making a presumably “rational” consumption 
decision: Team allegiance is not a “considered purchase.” If you are a 
Boston Red Sox fan, your enthusiasm may or may not be relevant to 
mine: Network effects and peer pressure can come into play (as at a 
sports bar) but are less pronounced than in telecom, for example. If I 
am a Cleveland Cavaliers fan, I am probably not a New York Knicks 
fan: A choice in one league generally precludes other teams in season. 
Geography matters, but not decisively: One can comfortably cheer 
for San Antonio in basketball, Green Bay in football, and St. Louis in 
baseball. At the same time, choice is not completely independent of 
place, particularly for ticket buying (as compared to hat buying).
Finally, switching costs are generally psychic and only mildly eco-
nomic (as in having to purchase additional cable TV tiers to see an 
out-of-region team, for example). Those psychic costs are not to be 
underestimated: Just because someone lives in London with access to 
several soccer clubs, allegiances are not determined by the low-price 
or high-quality provider on an annual basis. Allegiance also does not 
typically switch for reasons of performance: Someone in Akron who 
has cheered, in vain, for the Cleveland Browns is not likely to switch 
to Pittsburgh even though the Steelers have a far superior champion-
ship history. All in all, sports brand equity is unlike most products’.
Given the vast reach of today’s various communications channels, 
it would seem that successful sports brands could have a global brand 
equity that exceeds the club’s ability to monetize those feelings. I took 
ﬁ ve of the franchises ranked highest on the Forbes 2010 list of most 
valuable sports brands and calculated the ratio of the estimated brand 
equity to the club’s revenues. If the club were able to capture more 
fan allegiance than it could realize in cash inﬂ ows, that ratio should be 
greater than 1. Given the approximations I used, that is not the case.
For a benchmark, I also consulted Interbrand’s list of the top global 
commercial brands and their value to see how often a company’s 
image was worth more than its annual sales. I chose six companies 
from a variety of consumer-facing sectors (thus ruling out IBM, SAP, 
and Cisco), and the company had to be roughly the same as the brand 
(the Gillette brand is not the parent company of Procter & Gamble).

Three points should be made before discussing the results, which 
are summarized in Table 36.1.
 1. Any calculation of brand equity is a rough estimate: No audit-
able ﬁ gures or scientiﬁ c calculations can generate these lists, as 
Interbrand’s methodology makes clear.14
 2. Forbes and Interbrand used different methodologies. We will see 
the consequences of these differences shortly.
 3. Corporate revenues often accrued from more brands than just the 
ﬂ agship: People buy Minute Maid apart from the Coca-Cola brand, 
but the juice revenues are counted in the corporate ratio.
All told, this is not a scientiﬁ c exercise but rather a surprising 
thought-starter.

The stunning 8:1 ratio of brand equity to revenues at Louis Vuitton 
is in part a consequence of Interbrand’s methodology, which over-
weights luxury items. Even so, six conclusions and suggestions for fur-
ther investigation emerge:
 1. The two scales do not align. The New York Yankees, the most 
valuable sports brand in the world, is worth 1/24 that of Amazon. 
One or both of those numbers is funny.

 2. Innovation runs counter to brand power. New Coke remains a 
textbook failure, while Apple’s brand is worth only about a third 
of its revenue. Harley-Davidson draws its cachet from its retro-
grade features and styling, the antithesis of innovativeness.
 3. Geography is not destiny for sports teams. Apart from New York 
and Madrid, the cities of Dallas, Manchester, and Boston (not 
included here but with two teams in Forbes’ top 10) are not global 
megaplexes or media centers; London, Rome, and Los Angeles are 
all absent.
 4. Soccer is the world’s game, as measured by brand: Five of the 
10 most valuable names belong to European football teams. The 
National Football League has 2 entries, and Major League Baseball 
3 to round out the top 10 list. Despite the presence of more inter-
national stars than American football, and their being from a wider 
range of countries than MLB’s feeders, basketball and hockey are 
absent from the Forbes top 10.
 5. Assuming for the sake of argument that the Interbrand list is over-
valued and therefore that the Forbes list is more accurate, the 
sports teams’ relatively close ratio of brand equity to revenues 
suggests that teams are monetizing a large fraction of fan feeling.
 6. Alternatively, if the Forbes list is undervalued, sports teams have 
done an effective job of creating fan awareness and passion well 
beyond the reach of the home stadium. Going back to our original 
assumption, if tattoos are a proxy for brand equity, this is more 
likely the case. The question then becomes: What happens next?
As more of the world comes online, as media becomes more par-
ticipatory, and as the sums involved for salaries, transfer fees, and 
broadcast rights at some point hit limits (as may be happening in the 
National Basketball Association), the pie will continue to be reallo-
cated. The intersection of fandom and economics, as we have seen, is 
anything but rational, so expect some surprises in this most emotion-
ally charged of markets.
Supply Chains
When things went wrong in the past, customers might not know for 
months, if ever. As systems interconnect and social media tools give any-
one access to a global audience, bad news now travels fast and sometimes 
widely: A wave of suicides at Foxconn, a contract electronics manufacturer,

Information, Technology, and Innovation 
made global front-page news in part because of the company’s highest-
proﬁ le customer: Apple. Procurement managers now have the challenge of 
competing with nonindustry speculators who invest purely for proﬁ t; corn 
is one such commodity that has been transformed by interconnected global 
markets and the supercharged electronic trading systems that accompany 
such networks.
Apart from the speed of bad news, there’s the long tail: Stock-keeping 
unit counts at Amazon, Netﬂ ix, and eBay are staggering. Managing inven-
tory in such a world is an entirely different exercise compared to traditional 
retail. Given the primacy of search, matching technologies, and social word 
of mouth in connecting dispersed communities of buyers with unique tastes 
with big, dispersed inventories, supply chains can be challenging. Even 
Redbox, the kiosk-based DVD rental company, has had to be extremely 
clever about getting discs from where they’re returned to the next avail-
able machine: College students will rent in Ann Arbor, for example, then 
drive south for spring break, returning DVDs at various locations down 
I-75. Standard planning software cannot accommodate such unpredictable 
 behavior at a micro level; thinking more broadly, however, spring break is a 
predictable event, and algorithms can “learn” over time.
The IT Shop
The long evolution from the days of centralized, predictable tasks on 
mainframe computers—the heyday of the data processing group—to 
highly distributed, user-driven environments has entered a new phase in 
many companies. Three trends bear brief mention: clouds, consumeriza-
tion, and “deperimeterization.”
 1. Cloud computing is by no means the answer to everything, but it is 
greener, more capital-efﬁ cient, and more responsive to changing cir-
cumstances than many on-premise hardware solutions. Finding how 
and where clouds make sense, and ﬁ nding risk-mitigated ways to 
build them, will continue to be a priority for the industry.
 2. What Doug Neal at IT services vendor CSC has called “consumeriza-
tion” will continue to accelerate. Employees will experience mobility, 
data analytics, and real-time responsiveness in consumer settings, then 
bring their expectations to the corporate computing world. The infor-
mation technology organization as a controlling gatekeeper is in some 
companies evolving to the concierge-like role: The chief informa-
tion ofﬁ cer at the enterprise software vendor SAP says his goal is to 
become device-agnostic, given the pace of innovation in smartphones 
and tablets.15

Implications 
387
 3. Keeping information secure is harder in a mobile environment. 
Whereas a ﬁ rewall metaphor was useful for a time, the untethering of 
so much of the infrastructure means that boundaries between inside 
and outside, and between us and them, are dissolving. It’s a clumsy 
word, but the enterprise has become deperimeterized. That tendency 
pushes security from an enclosure project (keep our stuff safe and the 
bad guys out) to a much more complex task of education, prevention, 
and risk management.
Implications
The consequences of these and the other trends discussed in this book are 
not simple or easily summarized. At a broad level, ﬁ ve clusters of issues 
emerge.
 1. Change happens fast. More than once executives have expressed 
exasperation that the world is moving too fast for their company’s 
internal processes, cultural comfort, and planning cycles. In addition 
to the impracticality of slowing the world down, getting companies to 
move faster can be impossible. The stakes are high indeed.
 2. The worlds of technology and information are increasingly dominated 
by platforms and systems, which require different levels of strategy and 
execution compared to product-centric environments. System thinking 
is difﬁ cult to coax from a single organization; from an ecosystem of 
self-interested optimizers, it is, again, nearly impossible. Platform strat-
egies, when executed well, are powerful indeed: Think of Intel, or 
PayPal, or Facebook.
 3. Organizations are challenged to ﬁ nd the right size and shape from 
which to address their constituencies. This is no less true of militaries, 
governments, and nonproﬁ ts than it is of traditional businesses. Lower 
costs of coordination, faster customer and competitor behaviors, and 
lightweight infrastructure mean that jobs, tasks, roles, and supervisory 
relationships are all changing.
 4. One facet of the organizational question relates to physical place as it 
relates to cyberspace. Where are physical assets, face-to-face collabora-
tion settings, and backup resources located? At the same time, place/
space is reshaping personal identity, relationships inside and away 
from work, and the range of possibilities for convening problem solv-
ers, fans, concerned parties, or bad guys for that matter.
 5. Finally, risk is, well, riskier in a more connected world. Whether in 
ﬁ nancial markets, organized crime, or just random events, the web 
of interconnection puts entities into the position of feeling effects

Information, Technology, and Innovation 
generated far away. In addition, the speed of connection accelerates: 
The AIDS virus was spread by a ﬂ ight attendant who worked on air-
planes ﬂ ying a reasonably fast 500 miles per hour. Cyberviruses move 
at two-thirds the speed of light, or about 120,000 miles per second. 
That’s a factor of about 124,000 times faster. Are decision processes 
and reaction times accelerating in parallel? Hardly. And with more 
information comes more noise. Therein lies the challenge in a nut-
shell: In a time of extreme speed and scale, how do human decisions 
and processes keep up?
The Last Word . . .
Is innovation. If information technology is to have broad social impact—
and if, as Carlota Perez suggests, we are in the phase of economic his-
tory in which information technologies are absorbed into a multitude of 
everyday artifacts and processes—businesses, governments, and other 
institutions must move beyond the straightforward practice of optimiz-
ing existing practices. All of these organizations must innovate, in more 
domains, at deeper levels. Such processes as education, death and dying, 
and career management are ripe for reconceptualization and reinvention.
That need for innovation is also reﬂ ected in the realities of the work-
place, wherever it might be located. To generate the required number of 
new jobs and to address the negative outcomes of past decisions (whether 
environmental damage, certain forms of discrimination, or public health 
issues), innovation needs to be the human mandate, rather than a deter-
ministic technological outcome, of the information age.
