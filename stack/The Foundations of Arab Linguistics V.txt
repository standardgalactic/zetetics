Introduction
Manuel Sartori and Francesco Binaghi
This volume contains a selection of papers presented at the Fifth Conference
on the Foundations of Arab Linguistics (fal v), hosted by Amal E. Marogy at
the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge on
September 20–21, 2018. This conference constituted a sequel to the first four
of the series: fal i and fal ii had already been organized in Cambridge by
Amal E. Marogy, respectively on September 3–4, 2010 and on September 13–14,
2012; afterwards, Georgine Ayoub convened the third conference (fal iii) in
Paris on October 23–24, 2014, and Manuela E.B. Giolfo the fourth one (fal iv)
in Genoa on September 8–9, 2016 (for the proceedings of these conferences,
cf. Marogy 2012, Marogy & Versteegh 2015, Ayoub & Versteegh 2018, Giolfo &
Versteegh 2019).1
This fifth opus of the Foundations of Arabic Linguistics conference series is
specialinseveralways.Firstandforemost,thetitleisnolongerexactlythesame
as the four previous editions. In the present title, Arab Linguistics replaces the
previous Arabic Linguistics, which is an echo of the distinction sketched by
Michael G. Carter in a prominent article of his (1987–1988); since this fifth con-
ference was convened in his honor, it was then entitled Foundations of Arab
Linguistics.
Far from an essentialist view of what the study of language is in the Arab and
in the Western worlds, Carter defines these two approaches in terms of their
object, the theoretical and epistemological framework in which they are elab-
orated, and finally their scope. He defines Arab Linguistics as encompassing
not only this language’s own linguistic tradition (“the study of the native sci-
ence of grammar that has been continuously active since at least the eighth
centurya.d.”,Carter1987–1988:205),butalsothecontributionof allthoseinter-
1 Cf. also the reviews by Larcher 2015, Larcher 2018, Larcher 2019a, and Larcher 2019b. In the
present volume, the same editorial guidelines as in the previous volumes have generally been
followed, the only notable exception being the use of ǧ instead of j for the transliteration of
ǧīm. The transcription of Arabic follows the system of Arabica, with one major difference:
the initial hamza is systematically transcribed when it is morphological (hamzat al-qaṭʿ), but
not when it is merely phonetic (hamzat al-waṣl, thus: wa-ktub “and write!”, but wa-ʾaktib “and
make write!”). Inflectional endings are fully transcribed in Qurʾānic and poetic quotations,
as well as in grammatical examples; in other quotations and book titles we have opted for a
simplified system, in which pausal rather than contextual forms are used.Yet, in some papers,
full transcription can be used for specific needs.

ested in it, including therefore Western scholars (“all those whose concern is
with indigenous grammatical theory, whether in the Muslim world or in the
long-established tradition of Arabic studies in the West, are counted as ‘Arab’
linguists”, ibid). By contrast, Arabic Linguistics identifies the study of Arabic
through the lenses of modern linguistics, whose theories, standards and meth-
ods have started to be developed in Europe in the 18th century (“for the ‘Arabic’
linguist, whether a native speaker or not, the choice of Arabic as the object
language is [at least in principle] a matter of total indifference, since the whole
purpose is to deduce or apply a theory or test a model”, Carter 1987–1988: 206).
Carter argues that this opposition is particularly flagrant when it comes to
the difference in attitude to linguistic data: on the one side, traditional Arab
grammarians—and henceforth Arab linguists—work on a defined and atem-
poral set of data, while Arabic linguists adapt their corpora to their needs or
even produce as much data as is required (Carter 1987–1988: 213). Arabic lin-
guistics’ goal is ultimately identified as context-free universality, whereas Arab
linguistics is presented as a “humanistic discipline in the fullest sense” (ibid),2
as it is concerned with the development of our knowledge of the Arabs them-
selves: their civilization, thought, etc.
Nevertheless, even if Carter considers that Arab linguistics’ and Arabic lin-
guistics’developmentwillcontinueseparately,3heacknowledgesthattheyrep-
resentthetwoendsof ascalebetweenwhichonecanfindconsiderableoverlap
and sometimes confusion. Giolfo (2014: 3–4) stresses the importance of bring-
ing together these two approaches and proposes to see Arab(ic) linguistics as a
single discipline: in her view, such different approaches should be considered
nothing more than the expression of the complexity of the phenomena they
investigate. This is indeed the spirit of the papers presented in this volume,
whose authors delve into medieval Arabic grammatical treatises and develop
analysis mixing the two approaches and addressing both types of audience. In
the same spirit as Giolfo (2014: 3), we consider that “the word ‘and’ between
‘Arab Linguistics’ and ‘Arabic Linguistics’ is not meant to carry an adversative
meaning but rather a meaning that goes beyond ‘dangers of confusing the two’
2 This excerpt and the philosophical approach more broadly presented in this article certainly
explain the title (Grammar as a Window onto Arabic Humanism) of the Festschrift offered to
Michael G. Carter in 2006 (Edzard & Watson, eds.).
3 As it goes for Larcher (1992, also mentioned in 2014:v-vi), who sketches a similar dichotomy
between, on the one side, Arab(ic) linguistics made in departments of Arabic studies by
Arabists who do not always have a background in linguistics and, on the other side, Arab(ic)
linguistics made in departments of linguistics by scholars who lack a solid background in
Arabicstudies(whomLarcheridentifiesasmainlybeingArabicmother-tonguespeakerswith
a background in French or English studies).

[Carter 1987–1988: 205].” However, if a label was needed, the fal series would
indeed be an expressionof ArabLinguistics,ratherthanthat of ArabicLinguist-
ics: all the chapters take Medieval Arabic grammatical sources as the starting
point for analysis.
If we wanted to go further down the description of our field, its history and
its methods, we should also note that Arab Linguistics actually encompasses—
without distinguishing between them—two different traditions. On the one
hand, we have Arabs’ Linguistics, that is to say the tradition of studies elab-
orated in the Islamicate world, written in Arabic and ultimately dealing with
the Classical Arabic language.4 It broadly corresponds to what is known as
the Arabic Grammatical Tradition. This is not only the intellectual product
of the Medieval periods and pre-modern times, but some prolongations can
be found until today, in that most of today’s (Arabic-language) grammars of
Arabic reproduce not only the closed and atemporal corpus of Classical Arabic,
but also the methods and the theoretical framework of Medieval grammarians,
and even some of their examples. This tradition is unresponsive to the devel-
opments of modern linguistics.
On the other hand, we have Arabists’ Linguistics, that is to say the tradi-
tion of studies on Arabic grammar that has developed outside the Islamicate
world since the late Medieval times, and whose works are mainly written in
other languages than Arabic (i.e. the long-established tradition of Arabic stud-
ies in the West). While paying the due respect to the work of Medieval Arabic
grammarians and acknowledging their extremely important contribution for
the study of this language, the Arabists’ tradition takes into account the new
theories, concepts and methods developed by modern linguistics to enlighten,
completeandenrichthedescriptionprovidedbymedievalArabicgrammatical
treatises.Moreover,sinceitaddressesanon-Arabicspeakingaudience,itsome-
times tends to adapt to the Greek and Latin grammatical system and adopt its
taxonomy and terminology for the grammatical description.5
If this cycle of conferences can—in some of its contributions—address the
latter, it nevertheless deals primarily with the former, focusing on its produc-
tion and material, starting from the tutelary figure of Sībawayhi (d. 180/796?).
4 The term Arabs’ should not conceal the very important fact that most of these scholars were
actually not of Arab descent, and that for some of them Arabic was not a mother tongue
(Sībawayhi in the first place!), even though they had all been arabized linguistically. Just as
the term Linguistics should not be taken here in the primary sense of a specific modern sci-
ence, but rather in a wider way as “the study of language”. The reader will forgive us here for
this anachronistic use, which simply occurs for the sake of debate around Carter’s label Arab
Linguistics.
5 For an example of such a development, cf. Guillaume 2020.

sartori and binaghi
Contributors to this series are mainly historians of the grammatical and more
generally linguistic tradition of the “Arabs”, rather than of the Arabists’ one (a
historywhichisstilltobedone).Becauseof this,itmightevenbemoreaccurate
to speak here—at least for the moment being—of Arabs’ Linguistics.
The volume is also innovatory in the organization of its contents, which are
no longer presented in the sheer alphabetical order of the contributors, as it
was the case in the last three editions. Here, a thematic arrangement has been
preferred, thus reviving the approach of the opening book of the series. The
contributions are organized in two sections. The first one focuses on the status
of Sībawayhi’s Kitāb and tries to evaluate its impact on following grammari-
ans, as well as the debates and refutations it raised. It is this interest for the
reception of the Kitāb that explains the subtitle “Kitāb Sībawayhi: The Critical
Theory” given to the fal v conference and, subsequently, to the present pro-
ceedings. The second section explores later developments in the grammatical
and linguistic thought, and deals more precisely with the constitution of some
grammatical categories.
Furthermore, if this volume is particular, it is also because none of its editors
were involved in the organization of the fal v conference. Just as Kees Ver-
steegh stepped in to help with the edition of the proceedings of the last three
editions (fal ii to fal iv)—and this is also an opportunity to pay tribute to
him—,wealsointervenedandreplacedtheconferenceorganizerwhowaspre-
vented from carrying out this task.
Last but not least, the end of this editing process has taken place during the
Covid-19 pandemic, which has been imposing upon us a series of unpreceden-
ted containment measures. This will certainly mark the spirit of the beginning
of the third decade of the 21st century. In this context, the sixth conference
of the series (fal vi), initially planned for September 2020, has had to be
postponed twice, thus breaching the biennial rhythm of these meetings. Nev-
ertheless, we hope that the fal conference cycle will pass through this ordeal
and continue for a long time, leaving its enduring mark on Arabic studies.
We wish to thank the contributors for their hard work and their commit-
ment besides us in this adventure—commitment being a rare value that we
have to cherish. Let those who act with commitment be warmly thanked. Cred-
its would not be complete without mentioning Elisa Perotti from Brill, who has
been enthusiastic about this project since the very first moment, welcoming
and accompanying us on behalf of Brill publishing house, as well as Noortje
Maranus for the production of this book.
The papers in the present volume are organized into two main sections: the
first one deals explicitly with the critical theory of Sībawayhi’s Kitāb, while
the second one addresses further developments of the grammatical analysis.

of Sībawayhi’s notion of “ṭūl al-kalām”, which appears some two dozen times
in the Kitāb with reference to the length of utterances or parts of utterances,
as well as a number of other occurrences connected with the length of indi-
vidual sounds. After outlining the contexts in which the term is used, the paper
makes some interpretative comments and shows that ṭūl al-kalām, in com-
mon with the rest of the terminology of the Kitāb, is applied to elements at
all levels of analysis from phoneme to syntagmeme. Furthermore, the feature
of ṭūl al-kalām is strongly associated with Sībawayhi’s master, Ḫalīl (d. 170/786
or 175/791), who displays a refined concept of morpheme boundaries in asso-
ciation with the rules of pause (waqf ). Its link with vocative constructions
lends weight to the assumption that the language under analysis was indeed a
spoken form of Arabic. In conclusion, a few sporadic examples of ṭūl al-kalām

examination, and the paper ends with some remarks about a possible echo in
the treatment of the demonstratives in the modern pronunciation of Classical
Arabic.
Ilyass Amharar and Jean N. Druel (chapter 2) approach the question of
Sībawayhi’s heritage through the lenses of the textual tradition, confronting
the “canonical” text of Sībawayhi’s teaching to two unedited manuscripts of
the Kitāb. The investigation focuses on the specific question of whether is it
permissible to form the diminutive of the names of the days of the week, as in
ṯunayyāni ‘a little Monday’ or ṯulayṯāʾ ‘a little Tuesday’. Sībawayhi denies this
possibility, arguing that these words (‘Monday’, ‘Tuesday’, etc.), along with the
names of the months, are proper names that refer to only one item, not to a
whole genus (ʾumma): there can be many Zayds and ʿAmrs, some being smaller
thanothers,butthereisonlyone‘Monday’,justlikethereisonlyone‘yesterday’
or one ‘tomorrow’; in other words, the names of the days of the week have less
tamakkun (‘declinability, flexibility, potentiality’) than zayd and ʿamr. Ǧarmī
(d. 225/839) and Māzinī (d. 249/863), followed by Mubarrad (d. 285/898 or
286/899), criticize Sībawayhi’s position, while Ibn Wallād (d. 332/944) defends
it. In this paper, the authors shed new light on this very specific debate thanks
to fresh data from so far unedited manuscripts of Sībawayhi’s Kitāb (Milan,
Ambrosiana x 56 sup.; Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France ar. 6499). The
many variant readings give an insight into the gradual elaboration of the
‘canonical’ version of Sībawayhi’s Kitāb, in dialogue with the early grammat-
ical treatises, their commentaries, and their refutations.
Back to the origin of Sībawayhi’s grammatical activity, Raoul Villano and
Giuliano Lancioni (chapter 3) address the issues of his early reputation as
a grammatical authority and of his relationship with his alleged most out-
standing pupil, al-ʾAḫfaš al-ʾAwsaṭ(d. 215/830). The analysis of biographical

sartori and binaghi
and historical sources clearly shows that Sībawayhi’s reputation is already well
established between the end of the 2nd/8th and the beginning of the 3rd/9th
centuries. As for ʾAḫfaš, he is described, already in the first half of the 3rd/9th
century, not only as the transmitter of the Kitāb, but also as the heir and
successor of Sībawayhi’s teachings. Moreover, all biographical and historical
sources persistently record that the two scholars were part of, if not the same
grammatical school, at least the same scholarly circle in Basra. Based on these
considerations, the second and third sections of the paper offer a comparat-
ive analysis of the Qurʾānic material found in Sībawayhi’s Kitāb and in ʾAḫfaš’s
Maʿānī al-Qurʾān. Evidence demonstrates that the two books are rooted in a
commongroundoriginatedinthe2nd/8thcentury’sBasranintellectualmilieu,
and emerged from the same scholarly tradition, which should be identified
with the circle of the naḥwiyyūn.
Shifting attention to the Arabic Linguistic Tradition after Sībawayhi, Hanadi
Dayyeh (chapter 4) addresses the ‘profile of the speaker’ as a case study of
how the critical theory examines and reinterprets Sībawayhi’s heritage. Where
the speaker appears in Sībawayhi’s Kitāb as an originator and arbiter, it comes
across as a learner in the works of his successors. This process begins with
Mubarrad’s Muqtaḍab and is achieved with Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s (d. 316/929) ʾUṣūl.
Notwithstanding some later attempts at restoring the profile of the speaker as
an originator, notably in Ibn Ǧinnī’s (d. 392/1002) treatises, the study argues
that such a change reveals a shift in approach to linguistic analysis away from
Sībawayhi’s. The causes of this shift and its impact on the development of the
Arabic Linguistic Tradition will be examined.
Simona Olivieri’s contribution (chapter 5) reminds that Sībawayhi’s Kitāb
epitomizes the linguistic debate that took place among the scholars of Arabic
during the first and second centuries after the hiǧra, and that it constitutes the
evident result of the way the earliest grammarians interpreted substantial lin-
guistic themes. According to the author, Sībawayhi’s contribution to the devel-
opment of the Arabic grammatical tradition is such that his view and approach
lays the foundations of the subsequent linguistic thinking, becoming a gram-
matical source itself, together with the Qurʾān and the kalām al-ʿarab. Indeed,
the data discussed in Sībawayhi’s investigation are also included in numbers
of examples provided by later grammarians, becoming a self-standing corpus.
Hence, both the pioneering terminology he establishes and his data are to be
adopted by scholars belonging to later and diverse traditions. On this basis, the
paper investigates how the qurʾān al-naḥw is spoken of in later grammarians’
works and to what extent the exploitation of Sībawayhi’s arguments is specious
to defend Basran or Kufan theories. As a matter of fact, although the data avail-
able in later grammarians’ treatises are substantially the same as those already

presented and discussed by Sībawayhi, their interpretation sometimes shows
interesting variations, usually functional to the specific theory they want to
support.
The issue of Sībawayhi’s Kitāb heritage and textual tradition is also evoked
in Francesco Binaghi’s contribution (chapter 6), which closes the first section
of the book. The paper evaluates the radd genre that, nowadays overshadowed
by the most famous al-Radd ʿalā al-nuḥāt by Ibn Maḍāʾ (d. 592/1196), seems
to have been particularly flourishing in al-Andalus and attests to the Andalusi
intellectual activity in the field of grammatical studies. It presents a list of 25
titles, which include the name of some of the most important Andalusi gram-
marians either as authors or as targets of these refutations, and tries to evaluate
the content and impact of these treatises: even though almost all these texts
(with the notable exception of Ibn Maḍāʾ’s Radd) have not been preserved,
indirect information provided by other grammatical works or biobibliograph-
ical sources sheds some light on the issue. Two opposing groups emerge, on
the basis of which the author proposes a first sketch of scholarly trends in
al-Andalus. The fraction lines among them seem to develop along two main
issues: the question of the primary reference for grammatical studies—the
Ǧumal of Zaǧǧāǧī (d. 337/949), or the ʾĪḍāḥof Fārisī (d. 377/989)—, and the
epistemological definition of grammar’s purpose: an instrumental discipline
or a speculative science?The author ends his investigation wondering whether
these fraction lines are eventually linked to the textual history of Sībawayhi’s
Kitāb and to a struggle for Sībawayhi’s heritage.
The second part of this volume opens with a contribution that goes back to
theperiodof standardizationof thegrammaticaltheory(4th/10thcentury)and
focuses on the encounter between grammar and philosophy. Wilfrid Hodges
and Manuela E.B. Giolfo (chapter 7) analyze some of the sources presenting
this encounter as an open confrontation with a notable interest for the figure
of Fārābī (d. 339/950). As a matter of fact, it has sometimes been suggested that
Fārābī’s views about grammar put him in conflict with the Arabic grammarians
of his time.The authors examine the evidence and conclude that, although not
a grammarian himself, Fārābī is closely in touch with leading grammarians of
histime,anddescribesfeaturesof Arabicwhichcanbeillustratedindetailwith
examples from Sībawayhi or Sīrāfī (d. 368/979): no points of conflict are thus
to be noticed. However, although Fārābī casts his explanations in terms that
should apply to any language, the authors suspect he may not have had a flu-
ent knowledge of any language other than Arabic.
The books continues with a contribution focusing on taxonomic issues in
the Arabic grammatical tradition. Hideki Okazaki (chapter 8) examines the
classification of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl (“pseudo-object”) by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ based

on the grammatical concept of faḍla, which corresponds to laġw in the Kitāb
of Sībawayhi. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s major 4th/10th-century work, Kitāb al-ʾUṣūl fī al-
naḥw, is one of the oldest grammatical works that classified mafʿūl into five
categories with well-defined terminologies. His treatise is characterized by the
classification of each grammatical category based on the principles of compre-
hensive divisions, and by the arrangement of chapters according to this classi-
fication. However, his manner of dividing mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl is less assertive
thanhisclear-cutclassificationof mafʿūl.Accordingtohisdescription,onemay
say that he recognizes five types of “objects” (the five mafʿūl-s), as well as five
types of “pseudo-objects” (ḥāl, tamyīz, istiṯnāʾ, ḫabar kāna wa-ʾaḫawātihā, and
ism ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātihā). Ibn al-Sarrāǧ classifies these pseudo-objects based
on two aspects: the semantic relation between manṣūb and marfūʿ, and the
grammatical category of ʿāmil (operator). However, the paper argues that he
fails to account for the reason why nidāʾ (vocative) and nafy bi-lā (negation
with lā) are excluded from the category of pseudo-objects. Although Ibn al-
Sarrāǧ’s taxonomy of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl is accepted by Ibn Ǧinnī and Ǧur-
ǧānī (d. 471/1078), the classification of some of the categories is modified, at
least after the 7th/13th century, by grammarians like Ibn Mālik (d. 672/1274),
ʾAstarābāḏī (d. 688/1289?), and their successors.
Classical Arabic falling essentially within the written level of the language,
this one takes precedence in its descriptions, even if Medieval Arab Gram-
marians sing praises of an effective and relevant ʾiʿrāb which is supposed to be
regularly uttered. However, it does not seem possible to identify clear traces of
the integration of suprasegmental elements in medieval Arabic grammatical
thought, such as intonation for example. This is the purpose of Manuel Sar-
tori’s paper (chapter 9), which takes the distinction to be made between badal
and ʿaṭf al-bayān as a practical case study. Interestingly enough, not only does
this question not find an immediate answer, but there is nothing to differen-
tiate two examples given by Ibn Ǧinnī and illustrating respectively badal and
ʿaṭf al-bayān: qāma ʾaḫūka zaydun and qāma ʾaḫūka muḥammadun. Moreover,
a grammarian and logician like ʾAstarābāḏī states explicitly that he does not
see any clear difference between badal al-kull min al-kull and ʿaṭf al-bayān. In
fact, the answer given by the Medieval Arabic grammars may seem in some
ways confusing, ʿaṭf al-bayān being an intersection between the badal and the
ṣifa. This might be the reason why Arabists’ grammars of Arabic often avoid
addressing the difference between badal and ʿaṭf al-bayān. Two criteria are tra-
ditionally exhibited by medieval Arabic grammarians to differentiate between
them: an inflectional criterion in the very restricted context of the vocative
(nidāʾ), and a semantic and pragmatic criterion. This latter is based on the fact
that the badal is the essential term compared to its mubdalminhu, whereas the

ʿaṭf al-bayān is only an accessory element. The paper underlines, however, that
another criterion of distinction between these two appositions exists if one
wants to listen carefully to the old Arabic grammarians: this criterion is neither
distributional, nor inflectional (therefore syntactical), nor even semantic and
pragmatic, but suprasegmental. In conclusion, the author argues that medi-
evalArabicgrammarianswereactuallynotdeaf tosuprasegmentalcriteriaand
considerations.
Finally, Haruko Sakaedani (chapter 10) closes this volume with a study on
the pronoun huwa in Q. 112/1, where she indicates that qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥadun
is often interpreted as a subject, allāhu being its predicate, and ʾaḥadun this lat-
ter’s apposition or the second predicate. Her paper examines interpretations of
huwa both in tafsīr-s and in Arabic grammatical books. The author underlines
that, around the time of Zamaḫšarī (d. 538/1144), this huwa comes to be recog-
nized as a cataphoric ḍamīr al-šaʾn (a pronoun of the matter). According to the
author, there are two more “pronouns of the matter” in the Qurʾān: Q. 18/38
lākinnā huwa llāhu rabbī and Q. 34/27 bal huwa llāhu l-ʿazīzu l-ḥakīmu; here,
however, huwa is not explained as a ḍamīr al-šaʾn either. The paper postulates
that also in the case of these last two verses the reasons for such an analysis
are that the ḍamīr al-šaʾn in the Qurʾān mainly appear as suffix pronouns, and
that preceding contexts of these two verses enable huwa to be interpreted as
an anaphoric pronoun.
Even though the title of this fifth chapter of the series recalls once more
the name and central place of Sībawayhi within the grammatical tradition, the
papers successfully prove that his heritage and the critical theory that devel-
ops around his Kitāb are far more complex than a simple reorganization of
its grammatical matter, to the point that—after all—Sībawayhi can almost be
considered as a potential divisive factor among later grammarians. The articles
also provide some new interpretative tools which will certainly contribute to
deepen our understanding of the Arabic grammatical tradition.

Ṭūl al-kalām in the Kitāb
Michael G. Carter
Introduction*
The notion of ṭūlal-kalām is applied, in the manner typical of the Kitāb, to phe-
nomena at all linguistic levels, phonological, morphological, and syntactical.
Furthermore,itisconspicuouslyassociatedwithSībawayhi’s(d.180/796?)mas-
ter, al-Ḫalīl b. ʾAḥmad (d. 170/786?).
Thanks to Gérard Troupeau’s (1927–2010) Lexique-Index du Kitāb de Sība-
wayhi1itiseasytotracealltheoccurrencesof theterminthe Kitābinitsvarious
stems, ṭāla, ṭawwala, ʾaṭāla and istaṭāla and their derivatives. The roots maṭala
and maṭṭaṭa, which occur just a few times, evidently in the same sense as ṭāla,
are also taken into account.The data are representative rather than exhaustive,
and there will be minimal discussion of the grammatical points at issue.

eral,regardlessof theactualexpressionused,suchasṭālaal-kalām,ṭawwaltahu,

Phonological
1.1
Long Sounds
§495, D. ii, 311 l. 4/B. ii, 285 l. 7لأنّك لا تدع صوت الفم يطول حتى تبتدئ صوتا
When pronouncing unvowelled mahmūsa sounds in juncture across word
boundaries, e.g. ʾaḫriǧ ḥātiman “send out Ḥātim”, the sound is not prolonged.

more informative than the electronic alternatives (but cf. 3.13 below).

Kitāb. It is used here following the practice of the later grammarians. I am grateful to both

Extension of Speech Organs
§567, D. ii, 462 l. 1/B. ii, 412 l. 16والشين لا ت ُدغَم فى الجيم لانّ الشين است َطال مُخْر َجُها
لر َخاوتها
The sound of the [character] šīn does not assimilate to ǧīm because the point
of articulation of šīn is “long”, i.e. stretched or extended.3
1.3
Long Sounds (with maṭl)
§567, D. ii, 461 l. 7/B. ii, 412 l. 2يكونان كالألف في المدّ والمطْل
The length of final –ū and –ī inhibits sandhi assimilation, because they share
the properties of ʾalif (i.e. ā) in being “extended” sounds.
The phrase al-madd wa-l-maṭl raises a problem: is it merely a variant of al-
madd wa-l-līn, the standard designation of the weak consonants ʾalif, wāw and
yā’, or does it refer to a special feature of ʾalif alone? Jahn ad loc. omits maṭl in
his translation, as if it were a synonym of madd; see also comment in 1.4.
1.4
Long Sounds (with mamṭūl)
§566, D. ii, 456 l. 10/B. ii, 407 l. 19حرفُ مدٍّ ولينٍ كأنه يعوّض ذلك لأنه حرف ممطول
We also find mamṭūl, describing the lengthening effect of a “long” consonant
ḥarf mamṭūl on the vowels. As in 1.3, the relationship between maṭl and madd
is unexplained.
Given the rarity of maṭala, and the fact that Ḫalīl is not named in this con-
text, it may be a relic of pre-Sībawayhian terminology which never established
itself.Ḫalīlcertainlyknewtheword,butdoesnotassociateitwithspeechwhen

ṭūl al-kalām in the kitāb
15
A similar verb, maṭṭaṭa, occurs once in the Kitāb, in the statement yušbiʿūna fa-
yumaṭṭiṭūna “[those who] saturate [the sound] excessively prolong it”, referring
to the overextended pronunciation of the inflectional vowels, as in yaḍribūhā
for 3rd sing. yaḍribuhā. This time there is a possibility of the influence of Ḫalīl,
with whom Sībawayhi discusses this topic in the course of the chapter, and it is
noteworthy that in the Kitāb al-ʿAyn (vii, 409; cf.Talmon 1997: 347) the cognate
verb maṭṭa in maṭṭa kalāmahu is glossed as maddahu wa-ṭawwalahu. But again
maṭṭa, like maṭala, is a marginal term. At some stage the noun maṭṭa came to
denote the calligraphic lengthening of a line or a character to achieve the jus-
tification of the written text, and it also serves as a Qurʾānic diacritic, marking
the overlong recitation of ʾalif mamdūda.4
2
Morphological
2.1
Single Noun Status (with mamṭūl)
§159, D. I, 282 l. 8/B. i, 324 l. 19الاسمان فيه بمنزلة اسم واحد ممطول
This time mamṭūl refers to such long compounds as [yā] ṯalāṯatan wa-ṯalāṯīna,
which are compared with [yā] ḍāriban raǧulan in their equivalence to single
nouns.
Here again it is not clear whether mamṭūl is a technical term: it appears in
thechaptertitle,butinthebodyof thetextitisthenotionof ṭūlal-kalāmwhich
is invoked to account for the morphology.
2.2
Second Element as End of Compound Noun
§317, D. ii, 63 l. 23/B. ii, 68 l. 16لأنّ الاسم قد طال ولم يكن الأول المنتهى
A familiar general principle is invoked, that an element can function as the
end of a compound word, in this case the coordinated vocative yā zaydan wa-
ʿamran. As Sībawayhi puts it, “the noun is long and its first element [zaydan] is
not the end [of the word]”.
4 According to Antonin Goguyer (1846–1909) (Ibn Mālik ʾAlfiyya(2) 321, s.v. maṭṭa), but he
provides no sources.

2.3
Long Qualifiers
§39, D. I, 78 l. 16/B. i, 95 l. 8كما حذفوها من اللذَي ْن وال ّذينَ حين طال الكلام
وكان الاسم الأول منتهاه الاسمُالآخِر
The same principle applies to long qualifiers, which may be shortened by
elision. The trigger for this observation is the poetic elision seen in al-ḥāfiẓū
ʿawratal-ʿašīrati “those protecting the [vulnerable] gaps of the tribe”, where the
participlelosesthefinalnūnwhichwouldmarktheendof theword,butretains
the verbal operation of the full form al-ḥāfiẓūna ʿawrata l-ʿašīrati.5
2.4
Elision of Definiteness Markers in Proper Names
§123, D. I, 228 l. 4/B. i, 267 l. 8جمعتْ ما ذكرنا من التطويل وحذفوا
This quotation was chosen simply to illustrate the perils of translation. Trou-
peau correctly identifies taṭwīl as a morphological lengthening, referring to the
affixes and qualifiers of personal names which have been discussed exhaust-
ively in the preceding pages of the Kitāb,6 thus “[these nouns] combine the
lengthening which we have already mentioned.” But Jahn (1895: i, 338) has
misunderstood taṭwīl here to mean “going on at length about something”, and
accordingly translated it as “a wide-ranging description” (eine weitläufige Bes-
chreibung).
Sībawayhi’spointisthatpersonalnamesareaspecialcase:toadaptMarogy’s
formulation, they are “pragmatically definite” because of their “deictic access-
ibility”,7 so the presence of these “lengthening” elements is irrelevant to the
definiteness of personal names, cf. al-ḥasanu and ḥasanun.

Syntactical
3.1
Coordination of Noun to Pronoun
§216, D. I, 342 l. 14/B. i, 390 l. 5وذلك أنّك لما وصفته حسن الكلام حيث
طوّلته ووكّدته
5 Sībawayhi compares it to another poetic licence, the reduction of the relative nouns allaḏāni
andallaḏīnatoallaḏāandallaḏī,e.g.ʾinnaʿammayyallaḏāqatalāl-mulūkaforallaḏāniqatalā
l-mulūka “my two uncles are the ones who killed kings”.
6 Namely the definite article, tanwīn, annexation and quasi-annexation, adjectival and relative
qualification, cf. below 7.6.

ṭūl al-kalām in the kitāb
17
This is a simple example of the principle of the “long” constituent produced
by co-ordinating a pronoun agent and an overt noun agent, as in the Qurʾān
(Q.2/35andelsewhere)uskunʾantawa-zawǧukal-ǧannataetc.,wheretheagent
is extended (ṭawwaltahu) by the addition of a second agent.
3.2
Inversion
§31, D. I, 49 l. 18/B. i, 61 l. 14كلّما طال الكلام ضعف التأخير إذا أعملتَ
Itis unacceptabletodelaytheoperatingverbfortoolongininvertedsentences,
thus *zaydanʾaḫākaʾaẓunnu *“Zayd to be your brother I believe” is rejected (the
translation echoes the incorrect syntax). But if the sentential clause is not the
object of the verb, inversion is permitted, as in ʿabdu llāhi ṣāḥibu ḏālika bal-
aġanī “ʿAbd Allāh is the owner of that has reached me”. Sībawayhi specifically
states that ʿabdu llāhi ṣāḥibu ḏālika is not operated on by balaġanī, presumably
because in this fronted position it is the subject of a nominal sentence, and the
agent of balaġanī is the referential pronoun contained in the verb.
3.3
Elliptical Exclamations
§54, D. I, 117 l. 7/B. i, 139 l. 1فشبّهت بإيّاك حيث طال الكلام
Because exclamations of warning are typically a single word, e.g. al-ḥiḏāra
“beware!” the compound warning raʾsaka wa-l-sayfa “[look out for] your head
and the sword!” is regarded as a “long” form. Sībawayhi explains that the first
element, raʾsaka, has been assimilated to the syntax of another compound
warning,ʾiyyākawa-l-ʾasada“[lookoutfor]yourself andthelion!”,whereʾiyyāka
has dependent case as the direct object of the verb for which ʾiyyāka here acts
as a substitute (badal), namely ittaqi “be careful!”. In both structures the second
element has dependent form by coordination.
3.4
Separation of Elements
§37, D. I, 74 l. 8/B. i, 89 l. 3كلّما طال الكلام كان أقوى وذلك أنّك لا
تفصل بين الجارّ وما يعمل فيه
This illustrates the consequences of separating bound elements, as in hāḏā
ḍāribu zaydin fīhā wa-ʿamran “this man is the striker of Zayd in it and ʿAmr
[dep.]”, i.e. not “and of ʿAmr” because the intrusive fīhā breaks the syntactic
bond, forcing the change of case to the default ʿamran.

In ḥaḍara l-qāḍiya imraʾatun “[there] attended [masc.] the judge, a woman”
(the translation replicates the anomalous structure), the distance between the
verb and its agent allows the elision of the fem. agent marker. When Mubarrad
(d. 285/898 or 286/899) discusses this phenonemon he inserts al-yawma into
the text, ḥaḍara l-qāḍiya l-yawma imraʾatun “there attended [masc.] the judge,
today, a woman” (cf. 5.1). This insertion is unnecessary, but Mubarrad’s made-
up example immediately following, nazala dāraka wa-dāra zaydin ǧāriyatun
“[there] dwelt [masc.], in your house and the house of Zayd, a slave-girl” shows
that he wanted to stress the separation (al-tafriqa bayn al-ism wa-l-fiʿl) rather
than the distance of the verb from its agent. Perhaps for this reason he does not
invoke ṭūl al-kalām here.8
3.6
Long Vocatives
§148 D. I, 270 l. 7, l. 11f./B. i, 311 l. 13, l. 18f.تلاطو نيونتلا اهقحل اّ مل ةركنلا ءادن كلذكو
صارت بمنزلة المضاف
With the indefinite vocative yā rākiban “O any rider” the dependent form is
accounted for by Ḫalīl himself as due to the similarity between a dependent
vocativenouninannexation(e.g. yāʿabdallāhi)andanounwithatanwīnsuffix
acting as the completion of that noun, both regarded as “long” forms compared
with the simple vocative yā rākibu, where unmarked rākibu is defined by posi-
tion. He draws a parallel between the vocatives and the behaviour of the word
qabl: we find qablu and yārākibu in isolation, qabla and yāʿabdallāhi in annex-
ation, and qablan and yā rākiban with tanwīn.
8 In effect Mubarrad has discarded or failed to take account of Sībawayhi’s analysis, where
the issue is not separation but the hierarchy of definiteness, whereby delaying the indefin-
ite agent creates a longer than minimal utterance. Similar agreement issues are dealt with
elsewhere in Muqtaḍab iii, 349, again invoking separation. For a brief discussion of definite-
ness and word order issues in the Kitāb, cf. Carter 2015:38 and 2016:107f. = note [123] (b).

3.7
Irregular tanwīn
§148, D. I, 271 l. 17f./B. i, 313 l. 10ةركنلاك لاطو نوُ ن اذإ هلعجي
The lengthening effect of tanwīn also explains the anomalous vocative yā
maṭarun in a line of verse. This time the dependent form is not permitted
because the tanwīn is not an indefiniteness marker contrasting with a def-
inite yā maṭaru (unlike yā rākibu versus yā rākiban). Instead it is a marker
of tamakkun, so the regular ḍamma of the simple vocative is retained in yā
maṭarun. Needless to say this is disputed among grammarians, but that is not
our problem.9
3.8
Further Long Vocatives with tanwīn
§159, D. I, 282 l. 15/B. i, 324 l. 25كما لزم يا ضاربًا رجلا حين طال الكلام
Vocatives of compound words have to follow the pattern of yā ḍāriban raǧulan
to avoid giving the listener the impression that two separate people are inten-
ded: thus yā ṯalāṯatan wa-ṯalāṯīna “O Mr. 33” and not yā ṯalāṯatun wa-ṯalāṯūna
“O Mr. 3 and Mr. 30”. The presence of the tanwīn on the first element marks the
unity of the whole phrase, as if ḍāriban were the “middle of the noun” wasaṭ
al-ism and raǧulan the completion of it tamām al-ism.
3.9
Exceptives
§188, D. I, 318 l. 7–8/B. i, 363 l. 4–5كلذ لمُ تحاو يِوَ ق مالكلا لاط اّ مل هّنكـلو
كأشياء تجوز في الكلام إذا طال
In the exceptive constructions mā ʾanta ʾillā ḏāhiban and lā ʾaḥada raʾaytuhu
ʾillā zaydun the irregular case of ḏāhiban (instead of ḏāhibun) and zaydun
(instead of zaydan) is permitted because the length of the utterance carries
the excepted element beyond the reach of case agreement.10
9
ʿĪsā b. ʿUmar al-Ṯaqafī (d. 149/766) argues for yā maṭaran, appealing to the model of yā
rākiban etc., but this is rejected by Sībawayhi, perhaps echoing or siding with Ḫalīl.
10
Sībawayhi links this topic with several other constructions displaying the same (dialectal)
inconsistency in agreement, implicitly because of their length, e.g. the alternation of mā
ʾanta ʾillā sayran (D. I, 140 l. 16/B. i, 168 l. 15) and mā ʾanta ʾillā sayrun (D. I, 319 l. 11/B. i,
364 l. 5), which he compares to the inconsistency of agreement between mā fīhā ʾaḥadun

Long Bound Forms
§188, D. I, 348 l. 1/B. i, 395 l. 14حتى يكون ما بعدها معرفة أو ما أشبه المعرفة ممّا طال
The principle of extended utterances also applies to “long” constituents such as
ḫayrun minka, ʾafḍalu minka and others. The bond between ḫayrun and minka
is strong enough for Ḫalīl to equate it with the bond between subject and pre-
dicate: just as a subject arouses in the listener the expectation of a predicate
(Kitāb i, 346 l. 20f./B. i, 394 l. 16), so minka is obligatory after ḫayrun because
the listener will be waiting for it.

Compensation Issues, ʿiwaḍ
§223, D. I, 352 l. 14/B. i, 399 l. 15لأنّه إذا طال الكلام فهو أمثل قليلا وكأن طوله

The question revolves around the omission of the referential pronoun huwa

Qurʾānic ṭūl al-kalām
§272, D. I, 423 l. 20/B. i, 474 l. 20مالكلا لاط نيح اً نسح اذه يف ناكو
Even the Qurʾān exhibits ṭūl al-kalām, namely Q. 91/9, qad ʾaflaḥa man zakkāhā
“[God] has caused to prosper him who purified [his soul]”, dropping the assev-
erative la- required on la-qad ʾaflaḥa. But it is correct to elide it because of the
lengthof theutterance,inthiscasetheeightprecedingverses,allof themoaths,
“by the sun and its brightness, by the moon when it follows it” and so on.13

364 l. 1).
11
A very similar example occurs in D. I, 231 l. 7/B. i, 270 l. 11, mā ʾanā bi-llaḏī [huwa] qāʾilun
laka sūʾan, this time with sūʾan instead of šayʾan, which would make more sense, and is
confirmed by a repetition of this example, now with qabīḥan.
12
ʾAbū ʿAlī al-Fārisī (d. 377/987) accounts similarly for the elision of a relative pronoun in a
“long” utterance, cf. Baalbaki 2000 [2004]:201f.

The prose model for this is wa-llāhi ʾinnahu la-ḏāhibun “by God, verily he is going away”.

Overlap of Object Language and Metalanguage
§149, D. I, 263 l. 2/B. i, 304 l. 4ولم يكن فيه ما كان في الطويل لطوله
The problem lies in the vocative phrase ʾa-zaydu ʾaḫā warqāʾa “O Zayd, brother
of Warqāʾ” (a poetic example), where the second vocative ʾaḫā warqāʾa has
dependent form even though it is in apposition to zaydu and should therefore
agree in case, as in yā zaydu l-ṭawīlu “O Zayd the tall one” with independent
qualifier al-ṭawīlu. Ḫalīl declares that ʾaḫā warqāʾa is not like zaydu l-ṭawīlu,
because annexed vocative phrases, such as ʾaḫā warqāʾa, must be formally
inflectedfortheirdependentfunction,whilein yāzaydul-ṭawīlutheindepend-
ent form of al-ṭawīlu is permitted “because of the length [of the utterance]”,
li-ṭūlihi.
Jahn (1900: ii, 2)andReuschel(1959:22f.)correctlyreproducetheconceptof
morphological length, but Troupeau seems to have been distracted by the con-
text. In his Lexique-Index he does count four occurrences of ṭūl in the Kitāb, of
which this is the second, but he gives no page number for it: perhaps he under-
stood li-ṭūlihi literally “because he is tall” and not as a technical term.

Ṭūl al-kalām in Farrāʾ (d. 207/822)
The subsequent history of the concept is outside the scope of this paper, but a
few examples will be offered. Thanks to the monumental concordance of the
late Naphtali Kinberg, we can easily trace ṭūl al-kalām in the Maʿānī al-Qurʾān.
4.1
In Phonological Contexts
An intriguing asymmetry emerges between his and Sībawayhi’s use of the
concept: for example,both invokeṭūlal-kalām inphonologicalcontexts,but do
not apply it to the same sounds. Whereas Sībawayhi applies it to the weak con-
sonants ʾalif, wāw and yāʾ generally (1.1) and to šīn and ǧīm (1.2), Farrāʾ restricts
ittoproblemsof pronunciationof ʾalif incombinationwithhamzaorinpausal
positions (cf. Kinberg 1996 s.v. ṭāla). We may speculate that the two grammari-
ans are drawing on different traditions.

Here Farrāʾ discusses ḥattā with durative verbs in the context of Q. 2/214,
using ṭāla and taṭāwala several times in a meaning unconnected with ṭūl al-
kalām (cf. Talmon 1993: 84–87 and 2003: 39, 105, 146, 209 on this passage). But
although Sībawayhi’s treatment of ḥattā quotes the same Qurʾānic passage as
Farrāʾ and indeed the same poetic šāhid (Kitāb D. I, 327 l. 3ff./B. i, 417 l. 12) he
makes no use of ṭāla in any sense.

“Long” naʿt in madḥ
Maʿānī i, 106 l. 6ff.نصب المقيمين على أنه نعت للراسخـين فطال نعته فنصب
idem i, 107 l. 8لا ينصب الممدوح إلا عند تمام الكلام
There is a considerable overlap between Sībawayhi and Farrāʾ in their analysis
of thesametwoQurʾānicverses.Theissueisthedependentcaseof al-ṣābirīnafī
l-baʾsā’i (Q. 2/177) where al-ṣābirūna would be expected, and of wa-l-muqīmīna
l-ṣalāta (Q. 4/162) for the expected al-muqīmūna. Both grammarians attrib-
ute the dependent forms to the structure of praise and blame. However, their
explanations differ. Sībawayhi (D. I, 213/B. i, 248f.) agrees with Ḫalīl that the
dependent case is due to an implicit uḏkur “bear in mind, think of”, while Farrāʾ
states that in these expressions of praise and blame “the qualifier is long” (ṭāla
naʿtuhu), and moreover occurs only “at the completion of the utterance” (ʿinda
tamām al-kalām). Again it seems that both are drawing on independent tradi-
tions, but this time the principle of ṭūl al-kalām is invoked by Farrāʾ (following
Kisāʾī, d. 189/805), while Sībawayhi’s treatment of the same verses lacks all ref-
erence to the length of the qualifiers.
CuriouslySībawayhidoesusetheconceptof “longadjectivalqualifiers”inan
entirely different context elsewhere, namely adjectival agreement in a series of
adjectives. As Sībawayhi puts it, ʾinʾaṭaltal-naʿt lit. “if you lengthen the qualifier
[or the qualifying process]”,14 then the adjectives must all agree, e.g. marartubi-
raǧulin ʿāqilin karīmin muslimin (Kitāb D. I, 178 l. 17/B. i, 210 l. 5). Significantly
Ḫalīl takes no part in the discussion.

“somewhat longer” than the shorter word ʾaw “or” it can still mean the same.
Farrāʾ’s formulation, ʿalā l-tawahhum, is essentially negative, implying a false
assumption, but since it is applied here to a Qurʾānic usage as well, it must be
interpreted more broadly, along the lines of “on the understanding that”, see
the detailed study by Baalbaki (1982 [2004]).

Ṭūl al-kalām in ʾAbū Ḥayyān al-Ġarnāṭī (d. 745/1344)

applies the concept to a feature not discussed in those terms in the Kitāb.
6.1
Rubbamā and ṭūl/ʿiwaḍ
Irtišāf 464, l. 13فطول الكلام بالتركيب عوض من الفعل المحذوف
The issue is the poetic use of rubbamā without a following verb,15 exactly like
the elliptical English “maybe”. ʾAbū Ḥayyān argues that the extra length of the
compound rubba + mā compensates for the elided verb. Note the connection
between ṭūl and ʿiwaḍ, on which see further below, 7.8.

Ṭūl al-kalām as Part of the Grammatical System
When Sībawayhi says in 3.9, “but when the speech is long there is the capacity
andthepotentialforthat[i.e.tovarytheinflection],justasotherthingsareper-
mitted in speech when it is long”, he is telling us that ṭūl al-kalām is a general
operating principle of the language he is describing.
The remainder of this paper reviews the place of ṭūl al-kalām in Sībawayhi’s
system, starting with some speculations about the nature of Ḫalīl’s contribu-
tion, then examining the nexus of concepts to which ṭūl al-kalām belongs.
Space limits us to bullet points, though something with a less military tone
would be preferable, so the following comments are strung together in medi-
eval Arab fashion like pearls on a necklace, laʾālī al-marām fī ṭūl al-kalām, as
Suyūṭī (d. 911/1505) might have put it.
15
The verse rhymes in rubbamā, and is by ʾAbū Tammām (d. 231/845; Dīwān 260). ʾAbū
Ḥayyān claims that he knows of no other such verse, though the standard reference
sources also attribute a different verse with the same rhyme to Ḥātim al-Ṭāʾī (d. 578 ce) or
ʿUrwa b. al-Ward (d. 607 ce).

ṭūl al-kalām in the kitāb
25
7.1
Ḫalīl as a Prosodist
Ḫalīl’scontributiontothe Kitābisusuallyassessedintermsof hisachievements
in phonology, morphology and lexicography, but here we shall consider his role
as the founder of Arabic prosody.
Arabic poetry is a purely oral phenomenon, a particular register of speech.
The phonological unit of poetry is the line, bayt, a single indivisible acoustic
event,markedbyafirstsyllablecontainingnoinitialconsonantclusters(asdic-
tated by the law16 of syllable structure), and a final syllable exhibiting a rhyme
only partially (and if so, then only coincidentally) the same as the pausal forms
of ordinary speech. Everything in between is a continuum of uninterrupted
junctural forms, and no pause is permitted in recitation.17
The corresponding unit of prose discourse, kalām, shares with poetry the
property of being a single phonological event, bearing formal initial and final
markers, but, unlike poetry, kalām is of indeterminate length, metrically un-
structured and, most importantly, it allows internal pause, either at breath
groups or for rhetorical reasons.18
This paper argues that Ḫalīl’s analysis of kalām is fundamentally that of a
prosodist. The key feature of his approach is what might nowadays be termed
“suprasegmental”, that is to say, he accepted the word classes set out at the
beginning of the Kitāb, but he was primarily interested in the behaviour of
spoken words in combination, where the listener identifies the constituents
by means of audible clues, similar to the way the metrical structure of a poem
is perceived while it is being recited.
As a prosodist, Ḫalīl would surely have agreed with Frolov (2000: 61) on “the
prosodic irrelevance of word junctures” in poetry, but when dealing with prose
as a grammarian Ḫalīl inverted this principle to use the potential pauses in
kalām to extract its syntactic units.
In a process probably unconnected with Ḫalīl (and certainly irrelevant to
his purpose), it was these same pauses, potential and actual, which enabled
16
Borrowing Frolov’s term, 2000:60f., for this inexorable prosodic rule. This paper owes
much to Frolov, especially 61–68.
17
The end of the first miṣrāʿ, for example, is always in juncture with the beginning of the
second miṣrāʿ, except in the opening line of a qaṣīda, when both are pronounced with
the full rhyming form, e.g. … manzilī … ḥawmalī (Imruʾ al-Qays, d. 540? ce). For metrical
reasons manzilī cannot be reduced to manzil, the pausal form it would have in prose.
18
Qurʾānic recitation is not considered here, except to observe that its spellings are junc-
tural, even at the end of the verse, regardless of the recitation. However there are also
internal pauses, marked as optional or obligatory by additional signs superimposed on
the junctural spelling. To this extent the Qurʾān provides rare documentary evidence of
suprasegmental speech patterns, cf. Larcher 2017:74 for the parsing implications.

the division of kalām into written words. As is well known, the Arabic writing
system represents each word as if it were dictated in isolation, relying on the
speaker’s intuition as to where pauses could be made.19
In their conversations about Arabic, Ḫalīl and Sībawayhi were in fact
describing a preliterate, virtually pre-literary language, with all the data being
oral. We see this clearly in Ḫalīl’s treatment of ʾišmām, where the inflectional
ḍamma is reduced to the point of inaudibility: this speech act, says Ḫalīl, is only
discernible in the pursing of the speaker’s lips, hence imperceptible to a blind
listener (Kitāb, D. ii, 309 l. 1–7/B. ii, 283 l. 9–15).20 Likewise we see in 1.3 that
it is the sound of the language which interests Ḫalīl when he describes ʾišbāʿ
as “saturating by prolonging” the inflectional vowels, as in yaḍribūhā, probably
with extra stress on those vowels.21
Arabic orthography is not alone in lacking a notation for stress, tone or
vowel quality: in English, for example, we say “not every black bird is a black-
bird” but the difference in stress is not graphically marked. Likewise in “not
every noble man is a nobleman”, neither the stress nor the vowel gradation
are indicated: unlike the free noun “man” [mæn], the suffix “-man” is virtually
enclitic, unstressed, short, and pronounced [mən]. Likewise in French singing,
final silent /e/ creates an additional syllable by being pronounced [ə]. For Ḫalīl
such suprasegmental features were taken for granted: as a native speaker he
would use the appropriate intonation and stress patterns when citing the data,
without the need to provide any written symbols for them.
7.2
Morpheme Boundaries
Although he accepted the word classes set out at the beginning of the Kitāb,
words themselves kalimāt (or kalim) are not Ḫalīl’s primary unit of discourse:
he speaks quite frequently of ṭūl al-kalām in the Kitāb, but never of ṭūl al-
kalima.22
19
Ghersetti (2011:95, fn. 31) points out that the same technique is used in modern Western
linguistics.
20
Perhaps Sībawayhi had this in mind when he reversed the idea to state that even a blind
man can use the verb raʾā in the sense of “consider, regard” as one of the ʾafʿāl al-qulūb
(D. I, 13 l. 21/B. i, 18 l. 13).

in the Kitāb and the Qirāʾāt, but only the madda sign was incorporated into the standard

22
It will be apparent here and elsewhere that the collection of papers edited by Lancioni
& Bettini (2011), with its focus on kalima, has little overlap with the present article, one
exception being the contribution of Ghersetti.

ṭūl al-kalām in the kitāb
27
To be sure he does use ṭūl al-kalima in the Kitāb al-ʿAyn to refer to the
lengthof aword,butonlyatthemorphological/lexical,notsyntacticallevel,see
Talmon (1997: index s.v. ṭāla, and p. 145), where it is glossed as “conditioned by
word length” without further explanation. In fact the absolute length of the
syntactical “word” is irrelevant to what Ḫalīl meant by ṭūl al-kalām. We see this
in Sīrāfī’s (d. 368/979) scornful refutation of Farrāʾ’s assertion that the loss of
tanwīn in the vocative is due to the length of the noun. To this Sīrāfī responds
that length plays no part in the process: just as vocative zaydu alternates with
non-vocative zaydun, so do the fanciful and doubtless fictitious vocatives [yā]
fazaʿbulānatu,mazanbazānu, ǧūḏābadanatu,ʾušnābadabatu“andothernames
with many letters” alternate with their non-vocative forms fazaʿbulānatun and
ǧūḏābadanatun, quoted a few lines below.23
Note also that Ḫalīl’s term for compound elements with the status of single
words is ism wāḥid “a single noun”, not kalima wāḥida (cf. 7.4).24 We conclude
thathepreferredtofocusontheconstituentsof kalāmaselementswhichcould
be isolated (and hence quoted as data and discussed in the metalanguage)
by segmenting the utterance at the appropriate pausal points. This method is
independent of orthographical conventions, and avoids the need to define the
parts of speech formally.
7.3
The Role of tanwīn
The major unit of kalām, the complete sentence, can be taken for granted:
under well-defined semantic conditions, such utterances formally break the
silence with a vocative element (usually omitted in practice, D. I, 274 l. 1/B. i,
316 l. 5), and end with a pausal form, waqf, returning to silence.
Within this string of sounds the tanwīn acquires an importance which has
generally been underestimated: as well as marking morphosyntactic fullness,

does use ṭāla, but this is no guarantee that the Kufan himself did so—the item is not listed
in Kinberg. Cf. also 4.4 above for another use of ṭūl al-kalima by Farrāʾ.
24
A reviewer correctly points out that Ḫalīl does use [manzilat]kalimawāḥida to refer to the
compound word ka-ʾanna (Kitāb D. I, 423 l. 21/B. i, 474 l. 21) but this is in a morphological
sense, in keeping with what seems to be Ḫalīl’s predominant analytical focus. Moreover
he also uses manzilat ḥarf wāḥid for lan etc. (D. I, 361 l. 17 /B. i, 407 l. 16f.) and manzilat
ism wāḥid for māḏā (D. I, 359, l. 1/B. i, 405, l. 4), while ism wāḥid is also used regularly for
compound nouns such as ḥaḍramawt (D, i, 298 l. 2/B. i, 341 l. 16 and elsewhere), again in
a morphological sense. At first sight kalima wāḥida looks rather isolated in the Kitāb, in
contrast with Farrāʾ, who uses kalima wāḥida a number of times in a syntactic sense (cf.
Kinberg 1996 s.v.).

tamakkun, and indefiniteness (historically a secondary function), tanwīn also
indicates that the utterance is not yet complete, and is thus complementary to
waqf,25 the marker of completeness.26
Waqf audibly signals to the listener that the utterance thus far is complete
(without affecting the speaker’s right to continue),27 and that it is now the
listener’s turn to speak. In contrast, tanwīn audibly signals that the speaker has
not finished, and it is not yet the listener’s turn to speak.
This role of the tanwīn is confirmed by Sībawayhi’s report of the situation
where a tanwīn is, as it were, put on hold, because the speaker cannot think
of what to say next, but does not want the listener to interrupt. By adding an
arbitrary syllable, as in hāḏā sayfun-ī “this is a sword, um”, the speaker retains
control of the conversation (cf. Carter 2015: 47, 60).
7.4
Ism wāḥid
The notion that compound elements can have the status of a single noun, ism
wāḥid, is too well known to need discussion: it will suffice to note that the
secondelementof suchgroupsismorphologically“theendof that[compound]
noun” muntahā al-ism, cf. 2.2, 2.3.
It is here that the non-pausal function of tanwīn is most prominent. In the
words of Ḫalīl, speaking of the vocative yā ḍāriban raǧulan (3.8), the tanwīn
of ḍāriban cannot be elided because “it is the middle of the noun and raǧulan
belongs to the completion of the noun” al-tanwīn wasaṭal-ism wa-raǧulan min
tamām al-ism (D. I, 282 l. 17/B. i, 325 l. 1, and cf. 2.1 or 2.2)
As already noted (7.2) the term ismwāḥid is preferred over kalimawāḥida, as
if to avoid problems of the definition of kalima.28 There is no phonological or
morphological uniformity in what constitutes ism wāḥid beyond the fact that
the string can function in the place of a single word.
25
Naturally words which never have tanwīn (the ġayr munṣarif etc.) will not display the
formal opposition with waqf, but these are covered by the general principle of the lafẓī
versus the maḥallī, i.e. as allomorphs of tanwīn.

27
Larcher 2017, index s.v. segment, segmentée etc., introduces a concept borrowed from the-
oretical linguistics, namely segmentation, the principle that certain syntactic structures
contain potential pauses at the boundaries of major constituents. These pauses are not
marked by punctuation in Arabic, but it is interesting that translations of Arabic into
French often have a comma at this boundary. These are precisely the points at which a
listener might choose to interrupt the speaker.
28
The term kalima wāḥida is indeed found, but only in later grammar, cf. Guillaume 2011:61
and remarks above in 7.2.

ṭūl al-kalām in the kitāb
29
The relationship between ṭūl al-kalām and ism wāḥid depends on the con-
stituents involved: broadly constituents which do not themselves form com-
plete sentences are classified as ismwāḥid, while complete sentences, although
they may exhibit ṭūl al-kalām, are not treated as ism wāḥid, for example ḥaḍara
l-qāḍiya mraʾatun in 3.5, and the series of Qurʾānic verses in 3.12, which are
all “long” but are not ism wāḥid.29 The difference can be appreciated by con-
trasting the two phrases lā raǧula and yā raǧulu: the negative unit lā raǧula is
considered to be ism wāḥid of the same nature as a compound noun such as
ḫamsata ʿašara and the like,30 while the vocative unit yā raǧulu is equivalent
to an elliptical verbal sentence and therefore cannot be replaced by a single
noun.31
7.5
Baʿd al-tamām
The length of a self-sufficient (mustaġnī) utterance cannot be specified in
advance, though the point at which it is “correct to be silent” (yaḥsun al-sukūt
ʿalayhi) is governed by rules of formal structural correctness (ḥusn/qubḥ) and
semantic adequacy (istiqāma), on which see Kitāb §6. In this respect ṭūl al-
kalām and baʿd al-tamām are complementary: ṭūl al-kalām refers to elements
which are longer than minimal, without regard to their function, while baʿd
al-tamām invokes the functional status of elements (termed ʿumda and faḍla
in later grammar), without regard to their length. The listener thus performs
two interpretative acts simultaneously, (1) identifying the boundaries of con-
stituents with indeterminate length, and (2) distinguishing the two obligatory
constituents of the minimal utterance from any structurally redundant ele-
ments (including those with no function at all, laġw).
Thearchetypeforthis,whichhasbeencoveredinthesecondaryliterature,is
the phrase ʿišrūnadirhaman: the tanwīn (more precisely its allomorph here) on
ʿišrūna signals the formal and syntactic completeness of that constituent, after
which, baʿd al-tamām “after the completion”, further elements are excluded
fromthissyntagm.Suchstructurallyextraneouselementsusuallydefaulttothe
dependent form, for example in ʿalayhi miʾatun bīḍan “he owes a hundred, in
29
The grammarians were well aware that some types of sentence could indeed function as
a single element, but the distinction is not relevant to the data in this paper.
30
The issue is dealt with by Sībawayhi, D. I, 306/B. i, 351 and succeeding chapters, and is
conveniently paraphrased by Mubarrad, especially Muqtaḍab iv, 364ff.
31
Vocative utterances are construed by Sībawayhi as verbal sentences with a permanently
elided verb (D. I, 292 l. 8f./B. i, 303 l. 11f.). This adumbrates the more complex analysis
of the later grammarians, who treated vocatives explicitly as performative utterances, cf.
Kasher 2013, cf. also Larcher 2014:107ff.

silver [coins]” (D. I, 262 l. 3/B. i, 299 l. 7), where the tanwīn on miʾatun is the
marker of syntactic completeness at that point.
In principle every such tanwīn can be converted to pausal form if the utter-
ance is permitted to end there, e.g. ʿalayhi miʾah. A prominent exception is the
type ḫayrun minka etc. in 3.10, where, as Ḫalīl puts it, for semantic reasons
minka is indispensable to ḫayrun, hence its tanwīn must always be preserved.
Note that ʿišrūna dirhaman itself contains two tanwīn-s. The nūn on the
first word, pronounced in full junctural form as ʿišrūna, signals that there is
still more to come, like ḍāriban raǧulan, in contrast with pausal ʿišrūn, which
can only occur at the end of an utterance or segment. The other tanwīn, on
dirhaman, is a grammatical fiction which does not exist outside the metalan-
guage: in natural language only the pausal form dirhamā can occur in this
position, marking the end of the whole utterance, for example as an elliptical
answer to the question, “what is the price of those sheep?”. In Carter (2016: 196–
200 = [261–268] in thesis pagination) this distinction was not given its proper
weight.
Grammarians were aware of the artificiality of terminal junctural forms
when citing data: frequently a seemingly unnecessary phrase is attached to
a quoted example, e.g. ḥaḍara l-qāḍiya l-yawma mraʾatun yā fatā (Mubarrad
Muqtaḍab iii, 338, cf. 5.1 above). The intention is to ensure that the final word
of the data retains its junctural form with the relevant inflection. Another
example is yā ʾayyuhā l-raǧulu zaydun ʾaqbil “O that man Zayd, come here!”
(Kitāb D. I, 190 l. 19/B. i, 223 l. 12, cf. Marogy 2010: 177), where ʾaqbil protects
the inflection of zaydun, which would disappear in the pausal zayd, thereby
removing the point of the example, which is to illustrate agreement with al-
raǧulu.
7.6
Mufrad
In his typical manner Ḫalīl uses the category mufrad without actually defining
it, and has no comprehensive term for elements which are not mufrad.
Fortunately we have a de facto definition of non-mufrad elements in the
treatment of the qualification (waṣf ) of definite nouns and related agreement
issues in §104, especially starting at D. I, 188 l. 10/B. i, 220 l, 16. From this we
may deduce that a word is mufrad if it lacks all the following features: definite
article, tanwīn, coordination, annexation and quasi-annexation, adjectival and
relative qualifiers (cf. 2.4 above).
In effect this leaves only two categories of word which are mufrad, the vocat-
ive [yā] raǧulu and categorical negative [lā] raǧula, which are morphologically
isolated single words, while all other words are compound by affixation of or
collocation with the above markers. This property was already pointed out by

31
Silvestre de Sacy (1758–1838) (Ibn Mālik ʾAlfiyya 142) to distinguish mufrad from
its more common meaning of “singular [in number]”.32
Note that the morphological pattern and case markers are included in the
mufrad form, whether the latter are true inflections (dep. in lā raǧula) or not
inflections at all (in yā raǧulu, also dep., but mabnī ʿalā al-ḍamma). A trans-
lation of mufrad as “bare” might be a useful approximation, but it would still
only apply to [yā] raǧulu and [lā] raǧula. At the same time mufrad represents
a radically different concept from what is implied by kalima.
7.7
Murakkab
It was left to later grammarians to invent the complementary term for mufrad,
namely murakkab.33 There is no trace of murakkab in the Kitāb, not even of
the root rakkaba, and Mubarrad, and also Ibn al-Sarrāǧ (d. 316/929) (based on
a superficial examination), manage to discuss the issues involving mufrad and
non-mufradelementswithoutcoiningageneraltermforthelatter.Atthisstage
in the history of grammar there was no need to name the default category of
non-mufrad items, as they had already been adequately defined by enumera-
tion, cf. 7.6.34
The Mufaṣṣal of Zamaḫšarī (d. 538/1144) may represent a transitional stage.
In §48 he lists yā ʾayyuhā l-raǧulu in the mufrad category, leaving us to work
out for ourselves in §51 that only ʾayyuhā is covered by this term, and that the
full phrase yāʾayyuhāl-raǧulu belongstothe demonstrativecategory,following
the analysis of Ḫalīl (Kitāb D. I, 295 l. 3–6/B. i, 306 l. 6–8). It is thus by default
non-mufrad, but Zamaḫšarī does not use the term murakkab in this context.
7.8
Ṭūl al-kalām and ʿiwaḍ
References to compensation ʿiwaḍin the context of ṭūlal-kalām above (2.3, 3.11,
5.2, 6.1), point to a complementarity between the length of an utterance and
the ability to elide parts of it. As we know from his explicit statements, Ḫalīl
believed that speakers are under an obligation to fulfil the listener’s expecta-
tions (cf. 3.10), and this paper will draw a parallel between the process by which
a listener recovers elided elements in prose and the reception of recited poetry.
32
AsSilvestredeSacypointsout,apluralwordcanstillbemufrad,asin yāriǧālu,cf.Q.34/10,
yā ǧibālu “O mountains”.
33
The term muṭawwal is also found, for example in Ibn Mālik ʾAlfiyya(2) glossary 299. It
appears to be more limited in scope than murakkab, applying only to extended phrases
of the pattern lā ḫayran min zaydin ʿindanā, but has not been explored for this paper.

chapters by Ghersetti and Guillaume.

In both cases an acoustic structure is interpreted in terms of the listener’s
expectations, and the listener’s knowledge of the conventions enables missing
elements in prose to be restored, and poetry to be mentally scanned, whether
to confirm its metrical integrity or to detect metrical errors in the length and
number of syllables.
It is tempting to assume that elision cannot occur with mufrad items, since
these are already minimal forms, and there is nothing to compensate for.There
is one possible case, however, in the phenomenon of tarḫīm, such as yā māli
a hypercorism of yā māliku “O Mālik!”, where the emotional intensity of the
utterance overrides the morphological rules.
8
Conclusion
It is time to apply the principle of ṭūl al-kalām to this paper and bring it to a
close.
The terms discussed above are, to be sure, used relatively infrequently in
the Kitāb, but it is also apparent that they represent a nexus of interrelated
concepts which are applied systematically and coherently to a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, in a significant number of cases in association with the
name of Ḫalīl b. ʾAḥmad.
Bear in mind that these phenomena are all oral, acoustic events which could
only be segmented into constituents by hearing them, using the alternation
of audible tanwīn and pause to establish the boundaries, and measuring them
against a principle of minimal length determined by their function in the utter-
ance. As a prosodist, Ḫalīl was predisposed to perform such an analysis. He
wouldhavebeenmoresensitivethanmosttothoseorthographicallyunmarked
suprasegmental features outlined in 7.1, while his use of the complementary
notions of ism wāḥid (7.4) and baʿd al-tamām (7.5) suggest that he was intuit-
ivelyawareof whatmightnowadaysbetermeddomains,theextentof theeffect
of oneelementuponanotherbeyondtheconstituent,evenoversomedistance.
The case argued above about the role of prosody in Ḫalīl’s analysis is admit-
tedly speculative. If correct, it goes some way to explaining the cluster of terms
around ṭūl al-kalām and more generally Ḫalīl’s role as the provider not only of
most of Sībawayhi’s data but also his method of processing it as an oral cor-
pus. This in no way diminishes Sībawayhi’s originality, which is asserted from
the very first line of the Kitāb, and we should also take into account that occa-
sionally Sībawayhi uses the principle of ṭūl al-kalām without reference to his
master (Ḫalīl is not cited, for instance, in 1.2, 1.3, 2.3, and cf. also 4.3), suggesting
a degree of independence.

ṭūl al-kalām in the kitāb
33
Within a century of Ḫalīl’s death, however, the spoken language was
replaced by writing as the dominant medium for religious, cultural and admin-
istrative discourse throughout the Islamic empire. The most prolific writer of
the 3rd/9th century, Ǧāḥiẓ(d. 255/868–869) is praised for a book which, as the
reigning Caliph Maʾmūn describes it, yanūbuʿanḥuḍūril-ṣāḥibi “substitutes for
the presence of the author”,35 indicating the social consequences of the great
media shift. It did not put an end to oral delivery, far from it, but books came
to replace memory as the repository of both knowledge and the power which
went with it.The grammarians for their part had an interest in presenting Clas-
sical Arabic as a living mother tongue, so if there are any explicit statements
about the written language it is likely that they will be scarce, at least before
the Nahḍa. By that time scholarly interaction with the West might have led
the grammarians to the recognition that their naḥw “correct way of speaking”
had evolved spontaneously and independently into something resembling the
Western science of “grammar”, that is “correct way of writing”, i.e. “literacy”, but
that is a topic which remains to be explored.

‘A Little Yesterday’: The “Canonical” Text
of Sībawayhi’s Teaching Confronted to Two
Unedited Manuscripts of the Kitāb
Ilyass Amharar and Jean N. Druel
Introduction*
The two authors of this paper are currently working at the critical edition of
two different manuscripts of Sībawayhi’s (d. 180/796?) Kitāb: Milan, Ambro-
siana x 56 sup. (first half of the 5th/11th century), to which also belongs Kazan,
National Archives 10/5/822 (cf. Druel 2018 for the history of this split codex);
and Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF) ar. 6499 (dated 562/1166–
1167). Discovered by Geneviève Humbert in the 1990s, the Milan-Kazan frag-
ments contain readings that have never been studied. As for Paris, BnF ar. 6499,
it is the personal copy of the Andalusian grammarian Ibn Ḫarūf (d. 609/1212)
where he collated many variant readings from both the Andalusian and ori-
ental manuscript tradition of the Kitāb, as well as many glosses, his own and
that of other scholars.
Preparing this paper, we were looking for a grammatical issue that would, at
the same time, be in the Milan-Kazan codex (which contains only one fourth
of the Kitāb), in Ibn Ḫarūf’s copy (which contains only two thirds of the Kitāb),
and in the refutation of the Kitāb by Mubarrad (d. 285/898) (which contains
133 issues, transmitted and refuted by Ibn Wallād (d. 332/944) in his Kitāb al-
Intiṣār).We were following a track suggested by Geneviève Humbert (1995: 190)
thatIbnWallād’sjudgmentthatMubarradhadapoorversionof the Kitābcould
be proven to be true if we could find in the manuscripts variant readings that
would explain Mubarrad’s criticism.
We found a promising grammatical issue, thanks to an article by Monique
Bernards (1989), in which she studies Ǧarmī’s (d. 225/839) critical views on the

We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewers of this article for their very relevant
comments, as well as to Dr. Sulaymān b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-ʿUyūnī (Arabic Language Faculty,
Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Riyadh) whose expertise on the manuscripts
of the Kitāb is invaluable. Dr. Sulaymān also introduced us to a second edition of Ibn Ḫarūf’s
Tanqīḥthat reshaped our initial assessment of his views on the Kitāb.

Kitāb: is it permissible to form the diminutive of the names of the days of the
week? Is there anything like a “little Monday”, a “little Tuesday”, etc.? What we
found went beyond our expectations: we witnessed the progressive stabilisa-
tion of the text of the Kitāb, along with the tradition of its commentaries, and
that of Sīrāfī (d. 368/979) in particular. In other words, Sīrāfī’s commentary
seems to have played an important role in the stabilisation and diffusion of the
text of the Kitāb. In its older layers, elliptic and rough as they are, the Milan-
Kazan codex is the witness of a text that has not yet been influenced by Sīrāfī’s
commentary (cf. Druel: 2020).
The other promising finding is the genuine criticism of the Kitāb found
in Ibn Ḫarūf’s glosses and commentary, which seems to be completely inde-
pendent from Sīrāfī’s commentary. We found nothing relevant in Mubarrad’s
Radd and Muqtaḍab for the issue discussed here, and Ibn Wallād’s criticism
of Mubarrad cannot be linked to the quality of his version of the Kitāb on this
point,simplybecauseMubarrad’scriticismisextremelysimplisticanddoesnot
quote Sībawayhi’s text.
We will first present the “canonical” teaching of Sībawayhi on this issue, as
of Derenbourg’s edition, before turning to the two unedited manuscripts men-
tioned above: the Milan-Kazan codex and Ibn Ḫarūf’s copy. As for a detailed
presentation of the grammatical tradition, it can be found in Druel (2020)
where the following authors are discussed: Mubarrad, Ibn Wallād, Sīrāfī, ʾAbū
ʿAlī al-Fārisī (d. 377/987), Ibn Sīda (d. 458/1066), al-ʾAʿlam al-Šantamarī (d. 476/
1084),Zamaḫšarī(d.538/1144),IbnḪarūf,IbnYaʿīš(d.643/1245)andRaḍīal-Dīn
al-ʾAstarābāḏī (d. 688/1289?).

Formation of Diminutive Forms
Sībawayhi devotes quite a number of pages to the formation of diminutive
forms (chapters 359–396: Kitāb ii, 104–146), as a morphological testing tool
(Lancioni 2011: 7–8). Many words in the language are not eligible to the form-
ation of a diminutive, like verbs and their cognates, and particles. Examples
of verbs include: ḍarabat “she hit”, kul “eat!” or yaḍaʿu “he puts”. Verbal cog-
nates are the verbs’ “proper names” (ʾasmāʾ al-fiʿl, Kitāb ii, 137 l. 14, examples
include halumma “bring close!” or ʾilayka “go away!”, see Levin: 1991) and “nouns
that have a verbal status” (al-ism ʾiḏā kāna bi-manzilat al-fiʿl, Kitāb ii, 138 l. 16,
example include ḍārib, if used in ḍāribun zaydan “hitting Zayd” but not in
ḍāribu zaydin “the hitter of Zayd”, see Kitāb i, 54 l. 7–13). However, if any of
these words is used as a person’s proper name, this impossibility is lifted (see
Carter: 1981). It is thus possible (although probably very theoretical) to form the

diminutive of the following words used as people’s proper names: kul “eat!” or
ḫuḏ“take!” (Kitāb ii, 123 l. 7–8), sal “ask!” (Kitāb ii, 123 l. 10–11), ḍarabat “she hit”
(Kitābii,125 l. 20–126l.1), yurī “heshows”or yaḍaʿu“heputs”(Kitābii,126l.13–
18), sāra “he walked” or ġāba “he was absent” (Kitāb ii, 129 l. 4); ʿan, ʾin and ʾan
(Kitāb ii, 125 l. 1–3).
Let us now have a closer look at chapters 388 and 389 (Kitāb ii, 137 l. 5–138
l. 20) where the issue at stake in this paper is presented.
At first glance, the title of chapter 389 is misleading: “This is the chapter
in which a diminutive is formed to [express] its proximity to the thing [that
is made diminutive], not its similarity with it” (hāḏā bāb mā yuḥaqqaru li-
dunuwwihi min al-šayʾ wa-laysa miṯlahu, Kitāb ii, 137 l. 5). Unlike the preceding
chapters, 359 to 387, which explore the diminutive formation of all possible
morphological shapes, chapters 388 and 389 deal with cases where the mean-
ing is involved, not just the morphology.
In chapter 388, Sībawayhi discusses the case of words which have a diminut-
ive shape and meaning but no corresponding “plain” form, such as ǧumayl and
kuʿayt which both mean “nightingale” (Kitāb ii, 136 l. 21). The proof that they
are not diminutives lies in their plural: ǧimlān and kiʿtān, not *ǧumaylāt (Kitāb
ii, 136 l. 22). It is not possible to form their diminutive because they already
have a diminutive shape and meaning (Kitāb ii, 136 l. 20–21). The same goes
for kumayt “reddish-brown” (Kitāb ii, 137 l. 1), which is not the diminutive of a
“plain” form. According to Ḫalīl (d. 170/786?), its diminutive-like meaning lies
in its proximity to both “red” and “black”, which implies that no diminutive can
be formed from it. What is “diminished” here is the distance between the two
colours,notoneof thetwocoloursthemselves,justlikeinhuwaduwaynaḏālika
“he is slightly below that” (Kitāb ii, 137 l. 3–4). At this point, it is impossible to
understand this last example and how it relates to the diminutive meaning of
kumayt. This will be further explored in the next chapter.
Pushing his idea a step further in chapter 389, Sībawayhi gives more
examples of cases where the diminutive meaning does not apply to the word
that is made diminutive, rather to another element in the sentence. He says
that it is not rare in Arabic for an expression to carry a meaning other than
what is expected of it. Sībawayhi gives two such examples (Kitāb ii, 137 l. 13):
the expression yaṭaʾuhum al-ṭarīqu “the road treads upon them”, which is an
idiomatic expression meaning “the road is their guest”, i.e. “they welcome as
guest whoever passes on the road”, and which stands for yaṭaʾuhum ʾahlu al-
ṭarīqi “the passengers of the road tread upon them”, i.e., “the passengers of the
road are their guests” (cf. Lane 1863–1893: ii, 2948). In the first expression, al-
ṭarīq stands for ʾahl al-ṭarīq. Another example lies in the expression ṣīda ʿalayhi
yawmāni “two days were mounted for the hunt”, which stands for ṣīda ʿalayhi

al-ṣaydu fī yawmayni “it was mounted for the hunt for two days” (cf. Dayyeh
2015: 69).The examples related to the diminutives given in this chapter include
huwaʾuṣayġiruminka “he is slightly younger than you”, huwaduwaynaḏāka “he
is slightly below that”, huwa fuwayqa ḏāka “he is slightly above that”, ʾusayyidu
“slightly black”, huwa muṯaylu hāḏā “he is slightly like this” (Kitāb ii, 137 l. 5–
8). Sībawayhi says that what is “diminished” in huwa ʾuṣayġiru minka is not the
word itself (e. g., ṣaġīr) but the relation between the two words (e. g. huwa and
ʾanta, Kitāb ii, 137 l. 6).
The logic of Sībawayhi is slightly (!) puzzling since it is not clear why he
would consider that these examples illustrate cases where an expression car-
ries a meaning other than what is expected of it. However, at second glance,
he is completely consistent in saying that what is actually made diminutive
is not the meaning of the word itself (ʾaṣġaru, dūna, fawqa, ʾaswadu…), but
rather the relation between the word and another element in the sentence.
Strictly speaking, ʾuṣayġiru should refer to a “small smaller”, duwayna to a
“small below” and ʾusayyidu to a “small black”. This is because diminutives
apply only to nouns that can be “qualified” (tūṣaf, Kitāb ii, 137 l. 10), or, more
precisely, qualified as small or despicable, which is not the case with ʾaṣġaru,
dūna, fawqa, ʾaswadu, although they are nouns. They cannot be qualified. If
diminutives can be formed from these words, they can only express a prox-
imal relationship to the original meaning (“close to blackness”, for example,
qāraba al-sawāda, Kitāb ii, 137 l. 7), and not a similar, although diminutive,
meaning (as in “small black”). This is exactly what the title of this chapter
means: “This is the chapter in which a diminutive is formed to [express] its
proximity to the thing [that is made diminutive], not its similarity with it”
(hāḏā bāb mā yuḥaqqaru li-dunuwwihi min al-šayʾ wa-laysa miṯlahu, Kitāb ii,
137 l. 5). The semantic reason behind this is that, although they are nouns,
they cannot be qualified (unless they are used as people’s proper names, of
course).
We now better understand how the expression huwa duwayna ḏālika illus-
trates the diminutive-like meaning of kumayt (Kitāb ii, 137 l. 1). Its diminutive-
like meaning lies in its proximity to both “red” and “black”, just like in huwa
duwayna ḏālika, where it is not the word dūna itself that is made diminutive
(a “small below”), but rather the relationship between the two elements huwa
and ḏālika (“slightly below” and not just “below”).
The rest of the chapter explores other nouns from which no diminutive
can be formed, such as ‘pronouns’ (ʿalāmat al-ʾiḍmār), both independent and
bound, particle-like nouns (ʾayna “where?”, matā “when?”, kayfa “how?”, ḥayṯu
“where”),andmoregenerallynounsthatlack‘strength’(quwwa)and‘flexibility’
(tamakkun), such as man “who?”, mā “what?”, and ʾayyuhum “which of them?”,

or nouns from which it would mean nothing to form a diminutive, such as siwā
and ġayr, both meaning “other than”.
As for the names of times,Sībawayhimakesa distinction betweenwordslike
sāʿa “hour”, yawm “day”, šahr “month”, sana “year”, and layla “night”, on the one
hand, for which it is possible to form a diminutive, and words like ʾams “yes-
terday” and ġad “tomorrow”, for which it is not possible, because they can only
mean “the day before your day” and “the day after your day” ([al]-yawm allaḏī
qabl yawmika wa-l-yawm allaḏī baʿd yawmika, Kitāb ii, 138 l. 8). In these expres-
sions, yawmuka refers to the time when the speaker utters the words ʾams and
ġad. Sībawayhi adds that ʾams and ġad do not have the same “flexibility” (lam
yatamakkanā, Kitāb ii, 138 l. 11) as zayd, ʿamr, yawm, šahr and the like.Whereas
hāḏā al-yawm “this day” and hāḏihi al-layla “this night” can refer to present,
future and past time (li-mā ʾanta fīhi wa-li-mā lam yaʾti wa-li-mā maḍā, Kitāb ii,
138 l. 10), or just like hāḏā zayd “this is Zayd” and ḏāka zayd “that is Zayd” can
refer to someone either present or absent (mā yakūnu maʿaka wa-mā yatarāḫā
ʿanka, Kitāb ii, 138 l. 11), ʾams and ġad can only refer to the day before and the
day after whatever day is present when the speaker speaks. Nouns that behave
like ʾams and ġad include: ʾawwalu min ʾamsi, al-ṯalāṯāʾ 1 “Tuesday”, al-ʾarbiʿāʾ
“Wednesday”, al-bāriḥa “yesterday”, or the names of the months of the year. In
other words, ʾams and ġad contrast with sāʿa, yawm, šahr, and also with zayd
and ʿamr in terms of deixis.
Sībawayhi further explains that only nouns that are not ‘proper names’
(ʿalam) and which refer to a whole ‘category’ (ʾumma), like raǧul “man”, imraʾa
“woman” and the like, can have a diminutive form (Kitāb ii, 138 l. 13–15). Later
grammarians will argue on this very point: can al-ṯalāṯāʾ, as a proper name
for the third day of the week, refer to the whole category of “Tuesdays”, just
like zayd, as a proper name, can refer to any man called “Zayd”? According to
Sībawayhi, when one says “Tuesday”, they can only refer a specific day, known
to both the speaker and the hearer. There is not a category of “Tuesdays”, in the
past, in the present, and in the future that one could compare. The issue here
is twofold: 1) the deictic meaning of these words (linked to the time when they
are uttered), as opposed to their “generic” (ǧins, ʾumma) meaning, and 2) their
being “proper names” (ʿalam). As we will see below, the manuscript tradition
casts a slightly different view than the canonical version of the Kitāb presented
so far.

The Manuscript Testimony
Now that we have a better idea of the issue at stake, we can consider the
manuscript tradition of this chapter of the Kitāb in order to try and understand
how the text was transmitted. We will consider here two different unedited
manuscript: Milan, Ambrosiana x 56 sup.2 and Paris, BnF ar. 6499. We will refer
to them respectively as M (for Milan) and P (for Paris). These two manuscripts
are described by Humbert.3 We had access to high definition images of M pur-
chased from Ambrosiana and we had access to the physical copy in Milan on
May 3, 2019. As for P, we accessed it online.4The edition of Hartwig Derenbourg
(1844–1908),withwhichwewillcomparethesemanuscripts,ismainlybasedon
three manuscripts, noted L, A and B.
Here is a chronological list of the manuscripts (and their different hands, in
the case of M):
– M1: the first hand in Milan, Ambrosiana x 56 sup. It is not dated but has been
estimated to be from the first half of the 5th/11th century (Humbert 1995: 172,
199, 201).
– M2: the second hand in Milan, Ambrosiana x 56 sup. It is either the same
hand as M1, or the hand of someone very close to M1, belonging to the same
scholarly milieu, and who corrects the text right after the book is bound
(Bongianino, personal communication, December 19, 2018). M1 and M2 use
a dark brown ink and write in an Old Western-Nasḫī style, also called semi-
Maġribī (Bongianino 2015: 23).
– M3: the third hand in Milan, Ambrosiana x 56 sup. It is dated of the end of
Raǧab 514/end of October 1120 and 517/1123–1124 (Bongianino 2015: 9). M3
uses a yellowish brown ink and writes in a rounded Maġribī style (Bongi-
anino 2015: 9).
– P: Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France ar. 6499. It is the personal copy of
Ibn Ḫarūf and is dated 562/1166–1167 (Humbert 1994: 10–11; 1995: 234).
– L: Escorial, Real Biblioteca del Monasterio de San Lorenzo, árabe 1 (L in Der-
enbourg, 1881–1889: i, xxi–xxxv = 2O, in Humbert, 1995: 275–279). It is dated
27 Ḏū al-Qaʿda 629/September 14 (not 14–15), 1232 (Humbert 1995: 275).
– M4 is dated 714/1314–1315 (Bongianino 2015: 9). As for M4, it uses a dark black
ink and writes in a rough Oriental style (Bongianino 2015: 9).
2 As stated above, the Milan fragments and the Kazan fragments belong the same codex. Since
chapters 388 and 389 are found in the Milan fragments of this codex, we will refer here to
them simply as “the Milan manuscript”.
3 Cf. Humbert 1995:170–186 and 199–203 for Ambrosiana x 56 sup., and Humbert 1995:145–154
and 234–239 for BnF ar. 6499. In Humbert, M is called 1A and P is called 2E.

Ṣafar 1138/early November 1725 (not October, Derenbourg 1881–1889: i, xi;
Humbert 1995: 29, 197).

1140/1727 and 1151/1738 (Humbert 1995: 110). Derenbourg (1881–1889: i, v)
estimated its date in the first half of the 8th/mid-14th century. Its mother
(2Ç) is dated as follows: first volume, 26 Ṣafar 647/June 10 (not 31), 1249;
second volume, 22 Ǧumādā i 647/September 2, 1249; third volume, 22 Šaʿbān
647/November 30, 1249; fourth volume 20 Ḏū al-Qaʿda 647/February (not
March) 24, 1250 (Humbert 1995: 103).
In what follows, we will present only one locus found in M (four other loci are
presented in Druel: 2020).
2.1
Locus in M: li-ʾannahumā [laysa] smāni [smayni]
Therearemanydifferencesbetweentheabovementionedmanuscripts,regard-
ing the issue that we are studying here, and we will only present one of them:
instead of the reading wa-ʾammā ʾamsi wa-ġadun fa-lā yuḥaqqarāni li-ʾanna-
humā laysā -smayni bi-manzilati zaydin, which is found in all the manuscripts
mentioned above (except that B has yuḥaqqarna and adds wa-ʿamrin after
zaydin), M1 does not have the negation and reads wa-ʾammāʾamsiwa-ġadunfa-
lā yuḥaqqarāni li-ʾannahumā -smāni bi-manzilati zaydin (M 45r l. 15, see fig. 2.1,
the second line). M2 has then added the negation laysā but has left ismāni
in the ungrammatical marfūʿ case. Lastly, M4 has corrected ismāni in ismayni,
which is found in all the versions. The best evidence that the ʾalif in ismān was
erased by M4 and replaced by a yāʾ is that the isolated form of the ending nūn
is still visible. The rest of the sentence continues as follows: wa-ʾinnamā humā
li-l-yawmi llaḏī qabla yawmika wa-li-l-yawmi (in M, but wa-l-yawmi in the other
manuscripts) allaḏī baʿda yawmika.
5 According to Derenbourg, B is Saint Petersburg, Asiatic Museum of the Imperial Academy
of Sciences 403. Humbert writes (1995:197) that 4G is Saint Petersburg, Institute of Oriental
Languages of the Academy of Sciences (“Inst. vostocnyx jazykov, Akad. Nauk”) C-272, which is
a bit confusing. In 1930, the Asiatic Museum was incorporated in the newly created Institute
of Oriental Studies (Институт востоковедения, not “Languages”, as written by Humbert).
In 1951, the institute was relocated in Moscow but the manuscript library remained in Saint
Petersburg as a branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies. In 2007, it became independent
and in 2009 it changed its name to the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts (Институт восточ-
ных рукописей). By 1986, the call number of the manuscript had changed from 403 to C 272
(cf. Khalidov 1986:i, 302).

Our interpretation is that for M2 and the subsequent tradition it is not conceiv-
able that Sībawayhi intended that ʾams and ġad could be proper names of “the
day before your day” and “the day after your day”. This is clear from the com-
mentary tradition where none of the commentators envisions the possibility
that ʾams and ġad could be proper names. The addition of a negation denotes
the refusal—or the impossibility to conceive—that ʾams and ġad are proper
names in the first place. Indeed, the commentators did not embark on the idea
that ʾams and ġad are proper names but rather on the idea that their semantic
referent is not flexible (cf. Druel: 2020 where some commentators compared
ʾams and ġad to pronouns, like Sīrāfī, Šantamarī, and Ibn Yaʿīš; Fārisī compared
ʾams to a particle; and ʾAstarābāḏī simply mentioned the semantic limitations
of ʾams and ġad). It could then well be the case that the negation laysa in li-
ʾannahumā laysa -smayni was introduced by commentators who would not see
why Sībawayhi would call ʾams and ġad proper names.
If our interpretation is correct, the two versions of the text, with and without
the negation can be paraphrased as follows (slightly forcing the translation in
order to make it more explicit): according to M1, without the negation, “as for
ʾams and ġad, one cannot form their diminutive because (although) they are
(proper) names for the two days, (just) like zayd (is a proper name), they (only)
refer to the day before your day and to the day after your day (and not to a
whole category like the proper name zayd)”; and according to M2 and the fol-
lowing tradition, with the negation, “as for ʾams and ġad, one cannot form their
diminutive because they are not (proper) names for the two days, like zayd (is
a proper name), but they refer to the day before your day and to the day after
your day.” This second version carries the main information that it is not per-
missibletoformthediminutiveof ʾamsandġad,butitcastsawaythepossibility
that these two words are proper names and one does not understand the com-
parison with zayd anymore.
In conclusion, the reading of M1 is probably better. The commentary tradi-
tion, based on the reading with the negation, only kept Sībawayhi’s conclusion
about the impossibility to form the diminutive of ʾams and ġad, not his argu-
mentation on different types of proper names, generic ones (like zayd that can

refer to many Zayds) and specific ones (like ʾams and ġad that only refer to one
specific day). To be sure, later grammarians understood that ʾams and ġad only
referred to specific days, but not that they were the proper names of these two
specific days.

Marginal Glosses in P
The Paris manuscript ar. 6499 (P), which is Ibn Ḫarūf’s personal autograph
copy of the Kitāb, contains both glosses and textual variants.6 Most of these
many glosses bear a small ṭāʾ, just like the glosses found in front of the pas-
sages that we are focusing on here. According to al-Ruʿaynī (d. 666/1268) in his
Barnāmaǧ (81–82), Ibn Ḫarūf built his own commentary of the Kitāb, called
Tanqīḥal-ʾalbāb fī šarḥġawāmiḍal-Kitāb, on the glosses of his Sevillian mas-
ter ʾAbū Bakr Ibn Ṭāhir al-Ḫidabb (d. 580/1184), only adding commentaries of
the poetic verses to them. And indeed, when we compare these ṭāʾ-glosses with
the text of the Tanqīḥ, it appears clearly that most Ibn Ṭāhir’s glosses are integ-
rated verbatim in the Tanqīḥalthough the authority of ʾAbū Bakr (Ibn Ṭāhir)
is seldom mentioned. In the introduction to his partial edition of the Tanqīḥ
(46–47), Ḫalīfa Badīrī writes that Ibn Ḫarūf did not sanctify the opinions of his
master, and he gives many examples where he clearly criticised him (140–145).
Our chapter 389 is not found in Badīrī’s edition but in that of al-Ġāmidī (538–
541).
figure 2.2 P 84r, first gloss
The first gloss is found in the right margin in front of the text wa-kaḏālika
ʾawwalu min ʾams wa-l-ṯalāṯāʾu…, with a right-oriented footnote marker (see
Gacek 2009: 250 for the signes de renvoi) above the word ʾawwal. The passage
that is glossed mentions other words which, along with ʾams and ġad, cannot
have diminutive forms, including ʾawwal min ʾams, the names of the days of
the week, al-bāriḥa and the like. This first gloss reads: mutafarriʿun7 bayna kulli
6 We do not understand why Humbert (1995:147) wrote that Ibn Ḫarūf did not add marginal
glosses in his copy but only textual variants. The three cases we present here are clearly
glosses, not variants of the matn.
7 Our first reading of this expression was maqraʿun bayna, of which we could not make much
sense. Dr. Sulaymān b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-ʿUyūnī suggested the reading mutafarriʿun min. We
finally opted for mutafarriʿun bayna.

Thenextgloss(fig.2.3)isfoundontheleftsideof thepageandthemarkerisloc-
ated above the word fa-ʿalāmāt (P 84r l. 31). It comments the passage where the
text says that the “time proper names” (ʿalāmāt min al-dahr) mentioned earlier
cannot have a diminutive form.The term ʿalāma seems to have different mean-
ings in the Kitāb, but we find once in the Kitāb this meaning of ‘proper name’.8
The gloss reads as follows: yurīdu bi-hāḏihi l-maʿārifi l-ʾaǧnāsa wa-ʿalā hāḏā
l-ḥaddiyušīruʾilayhāwa-laysatʿalāqawlihil-ʿāmuʿāmuhāli-ʾannahuqadyunab-

[expressions], he intends the categories and this is how he refers to them, not
as in [the expression] al-ʿāmu ʿāmuhā (“this year is her year”), because one may
refer to the present by the definite article (bihimā), specifying [it] by the article
from its category”. The expression al-ʿāmu ʿāmuhā is found once in the Kitāb
(i, 177 l. 2) where it serves as an example of the definite article referring to the
present in a time expression in the independent case, as opposed to the time
complements(ẓurūf )inthedependentcase,asinal-hilālual-laylata(“thecres-
cent is tonight”). As for the translation of humā by ‘the definite article’, we rely
on Ibn Ḫarūf’s commentary dealing with this issue (Tanqīḥ[Badīrī] 372 l. 19–
373 l. 2), where he refers once to the definite article as ʾalif wa-lām, and then
simply as humā.
IbnṬāhir glosses here that the definite article can carry two meanings: it can
refer to the whole category (ǧins), as in Sībawayhi’s “time proper names” (ʿalā-

and ʿAmr”, Kitāb ii, 85 l. 10–11).

māt min al-dahr) or to the present, as in al-ʿāmu ʿāmuhā. In his Tanqīḥ[Badīrī]
(373 l. 1), Ibn Ḫarūf explains that the addition of the definite article to the word
iṯnayniservestwooppositemeanings:thewholecategoryandthepropername.
In this, he disagrees with Sībawayhi who teaches that the names of the days of
the week do not refer to a whole category (cf. Druel: 2020).
Our interpretation of this gloss is that Ibn Ḫarūf’s master, ʾAbū Bakr Ibn
Ṭāhir, tries to reconcile his teaching with the text of the Kitāb. For Sībawayhi,
the reason why these words do not have a diminutive form is because they do
not refer to a whole category but only to specific times, and the definite article
plays no role in this. For Ibn Ṭāhir, these words can both refer to categories and
todefinitetimes,linkedtothepresenttimewhenthespeakeruttersthem.Both
meaning are made possible by the definite article. If Sībawayhi, according to
Ibn Ṭāhir’s gloss, forbids their diminutive formation, it is only when they refer
to a specific time, linked to the present, which is not what Sībawayhi intends…
In his Tanqīḥ, Ibn Ḫarūf does not hesitate to contradict Sībawayhi front-
ally on this issue, thus taking a step further than his master Ibn Ṭāhir. In his
commentary of chapter 389 (Tanqīḥ[Ġāmidī], 538–541), Ibn Ḫarūf explains
that ʾams and ġad can serve both meanings, the deictic one (“yesterday”) and
the generic one (“the day before”). This second meaning is usually expressed
by the definite article. If the first meaning is intented, ʾams and ġad do not
have a diminutive form whereas if the second meaning is intended, it is pos-
sible to form their diminutive. Ironically, Ibn Ḫarūf even quotes a poetic verse
found in the Kitāb were ʾams has a generic meaning (Tanqīḥ[Ġāmidī], 539 l. 8;
Kitāb i, 248 l. 13): ʾa-min ʿamali al-Ǧarrāfi ʾamsi wa-ẓulmihi wa-ʿudwānihi ʾaʿtab-
tumūnā barāsimi “Is it because of al-Ǧarrāf’s deeds, iniquity and enemity, the
day before, that you inflicted diseases on us?”. It is not completely clear at this
point what forbids to understand ʾams here are meaning “yesterday”. Is it the
past tense of the verb ʾaʿtaba that implies a narration in the past instead of a
narrationcontemporaneoustotheutterance?IbnḪarūf alsoquotestheQurʾān
where al-ʾams has a generic meaning (Tanqīḥ[Ġāmidī], 539 l. 12–13; Q. 28 al-
Qaṣaṣ, 82).
The last gloss (fig. 2.4) is also found on the left side of the page, and its signe-
de-renvoi is located above the word al-ism in the sentence ʾinnamā yuḥaqqaru
l-ismu ġayru l-ʿalami (P 84r l. 31). Its texts reads: ʾarā fī ʾasmāʾi al-šuhūri wa-
ʾayyāmi l-ʾusbūʿi kamā ʾarāhu fī ʾamsi wa-ġadin wa-l-bāriḥati wa-ʾawwali min

proper names they have the same status as Zayd and ʿAmr. Don’t you see that
their referent does not change, whether they are close or far, and for this, they
canbeputinthedualandtheplural.Butʾams, ġadandtheotherpropernames,
their referent changes when they are far”.
The text of this gloss is very puzzling because there seems to be a contradic-
tion in the comparison. On the one hand, Ibn Ṭāhir says that the names of the
months and days compare to ʾams and the like, but then he says in great detail
that, unlike them, their referent does not change when they are “far” (i.e., not
present to the speaker).
Thisgloss of IbnṬāhirisrephrasedbyIbnḪarūf inhisTanqīḥ[Ġāmidī](539)
and there, a negation is found that gives the gloss a much clearer meaning:
wa-ʾammā ʾasmāʾu al-šuhūri wa-ʾasmāʾu al-ʾayyāmi ka-l-muḥarrami wa-ṣafara
wa-l-sabti wa-l-ʾaḥadi wa-ʾaḫawātihā wa-ʾamsi wa-ġadun min yawmin bi-ʿaynihi

ʾannahā lā tantaqilu ʿan musammayātihā wa-l-ʾaʿlāmu tantaqilu “as for the
names of the months and the days, like al-Muḥarram, Ṣafar, Saturday, Sunday
and the like, and ʾams and ġad of a specific day, and ʾawwal min ʾams and al-
bāriḥa, they have the same status as zayd and ʿamr, except that their referent
does not change whereas that of the names does.”
In the following lines (Tanqīḥ[Ġāmidī], 540), Ibn Ḫarūf explains that per-
sonalnamesdonotapply(mawqūfa)toonlyonespecificpersonbutthat“Zayd”
can refer to many different Zayds, whereas not everyday can be called al-sabt
or al-ʾaḥad.
It is thus very clear that for Ibn Ḫarūf although ʾams and ġad share the same
status (bi-manzilati) as Zayd and ʿAmr (i.e., being proper names?), the former
can have two meanings (deictic, if referring to a specific day, and generic, espe-
cially if carrying the definite article) whereas the latter only have a generic
meaning (all the persons bearing this name). For Ibn Ḫarūf, it is possible to
form the diminutive of ʾams and ġad only if their generic meaning is inten-
ded.

In the end, the difference between Sībawayhi and Ibn Ḫarūf is that Sībaway-
hi does not acknowledge a generic meaning to ʾams and ġad but only a deictic
one.

Assessment of the Manuscript Tradition
As concluded by former research (Humbert 1995: 176; Druel 2019), M3 tends
to align the text of M1 and M2 towards the “canonical” version, i.e, the version
that is edited by Derenbourg (on L, A, and B) and which became the basis for
the further, most widespread editions of the Kitāb (Būlāq and Hārūn, cf. Druel
2018: 23–24). The example in M (li-ʾannahumā -smāni →laysa smāni →laysa -
smayni) is extremely interesting in this regard: the later tradition probably did
not understand (or agree on) the teaching of Sībawayhi that ʾams and ġad are
“proper names” and thus modified the text of the Kitāb. We argue that the suc-
cessive hands in M are a witness of a process that led to the version we know
today. A thorough study of all the variants found in M is obviously needed to
evaluate the extent of this process.
The glosses found in P originate in the teaching of Ibn Ḫarūf’s master, ʾAbū
Bakr Ibn Ṭāhir. Ibn Ḫarūf later incorporated them in his Tanqīḥal-ʾalbāb fī šarḥ
ġawāmiḍal-Kitāb. In this commentary, Ibn Ḫarūf pushes his master’s criticism
of Sībawayhi’s text a step further by adding a distinction between two mean-
ings for ʾams and ġad, deictic and generic, quoting poetry and the Qurʾān. He
thus opens the possibility of forming a diminutive of these words, when their
generic meaning is intended.
It is not possible to decide whether Ibn Ḫarūf would consider ʾams and ġad
to be proper names but his commentary does not forbid this eventuality, espe-
cially when he quotes Sībawayhi’s expression that they have the same “status”
(bi-manzilati) as Zayd and ʿAmr. To be sure, however, Ibn Ḫarūf’s version of the
Kitāb does contain the negation laysā -smayni (P 84r, l. 26).
Despite its limited scope, we hope that this article can encourage scholars
to study Ibn Ḫarūf’s Tanqīḥ, along with his master’s glosses, that he patiently
transcribed in his own copy of the Kitāb.

Arabic Grammar and Qurʾānic Scholarship in
2nd/8th Century’s Basra: A Comparative Analysis of
the Qurʾānic Material Found in the Kitāb Sībawayhi
and in al-ʾAḫfaš al-ʾAwsaṭ’s Maʿānī al-Qurʾān
Raoul Villano and Giuliano Lancioni
Introduction*
Sībawayhi’s (d. 180/796?) actual reputation as a grammatical authority while
still in life and in the first decades after his early death has been the subject of
much scholarly debate, as well as the real nature of the relationship between
Sībawayhiandtheintellectualcommunityof thetime,notablyhisallegedmost
outstanding pupil al-ʾAḫfaš al-ʾAwsaṭ(d. 215/830, henceforth ʾAḫfaš).1
Thisisdue,partly,tothelackandambiguityof datafoundinClassicalArabic
biographies, and partly, to a widespread, unduly, hypersceptical attitude in
Western scholarship on early Arabic grammatical tradition.2 The whole issue
needs to be framed into the wider debate over the historical existence of gram-
matical schools in Basra and Kufa during 2nd/8th and early 3rd/9th centuries.
Accordingtothetraditionalaccount,earlyhistoryof Arabicgrammarwasdom-
inated by the opposition between the grammatical schools of Basra and Kufa:
the schools were established in both Basra and Kufa already in early 2nd/8th
century, and the historical existence of grammatical debates between leading

scholars of the two rival towns is attested, in Baghdad, at least starting from the
caliphate of Hārūn al-Rašīd (r. 170/786–193/809).3
The traditional account has been seriously challenged by Gotthold Weil
(1882–1960; cf. Weil 1913) who calls into question the existence of a real Kufan
grammatical tradition and, based on the fact that no direct mention of the
schools as such can be found in the works of Sībawayhi, Farrāʾ (d. 207/822), and
Mubarrad(d.285/898),arguesthatbothgrammaticaldebatesandgrammatical
schools as proponents and advocates of points of controversy are a literary fic-
tion forged by scholars of the generation after Mubarrad andṮaʿlab (d. 291/904)
who projected, in Weil’s hypothesis, their own oppositions back into a former
situation that never existed in reality (cf. Weil 1913: 53ff.). Although devoid of
any objective evidence and based solely on an extensive application of the
argumentum e silentio, Weil’s hypothesis has dominated the scholarly debate
until recent times.
HenriFleisch(1904–1985)corroboratesWeil’sreconstructionandthinksthat
at the times of Sībawayhi real encounters between grammarians must have
been a rare and very unlikely occurrence. He identifies Basra and Kufa as cen-
ters of grammatical studies, rather than real schools, emphasizing, thus, the
geographical aspect over the methodological one (cf. Fleisch 1961–1979: i, 11–
34).
Gérard Troupeau (1927–2010), on the contrary, accepts the traditional
account, but speaks of methods (indeed a proper translation of the Arabic
maḏhab) rather than schools, because, as he explains, already in 2nd/8th cen-
tury, great Kufan masters like Kisāʾī (d. 189/805) and his pupil Farrāʾ used to live
and teach in Baghdad and, by 4th/10th century, all Basran masters were estab-
lished in Baghdad (cf. Troupeau 1962).
Weil’s hypothesis is corroborated again by Carter (1973) who believes that
the schools are a backward projection operated in 3rd/9th century and that
the only real Arabic grammatical school is Basra. The two schools represent,
in Carter’s hypothesis, a specific reaction to the tensions occurred during the
process of institutionalization of Islam, consistently with what happened in
fiqh. The school of Basra would be, therefore, the result of a cultural process
that is typical of early Islam and the Kitāb itself is not to be considered as Bas-
ran, firstly because at the times of Sībawayhi there were, according to Carter’s
reconstruction, no Basran nor Kufan schools, and secondly because later Bas-
ran approach to grammar proves to be didactic and prescriptive, while the
Kitābstillshowsaspeculativeanddescriptivistapproachtipycalof earlyArabic

grammaticalthinking.Theschoolof Basrawouldbe,therefore,theresultof this
process of legitimation that occurred later in 3rd/9th century’s Baghdad while
Kufa’s school would have been built only in opposition with the principles of
the new grammar elaborated in Baghdad.
An opposite point of view is to be found in Versteegh (1977: 107–112) who
believes that the terminological divergence between the two schools needs to
be framed in a dichotomic scheme. In his point of view, while it is true that real
differences of opinion between the two schools were mainly related to points
of detail and that from a methodological point of view the two schools were
much more closer than what is depicted by later sources, it is still very unlikely
that such a specific and developed terminology, like the one attributed by later
sources to Kufan grammarians and found, as a matter of fact, in the works of
Farrāʾ and Ṯaʿlab, could be the product of one single scholar “unless we are to
assume that later grammarians not only invented the Kufan school, but a spe-
cial terminology to go with it as well”.
A real turning point is Baalbaki (1981) who admits that no mention of the
schools as such is to be found in the works of Sībawayhi and Farrāʾ,4 and recog-
nizesthatthereismuchmoreincommonbetweenthetwoschoolsthanwhatis
schematically represented in later sources, both in terms of method, termino-
logy, sources, and subject-matter. Nonetheless, by comparing extant sources of
2nd/8th and 3rd/9th centuries, like Sībawayhi, Farrāʾ, Ibn al-Sikkīt (d. 244/858),
Mubarrad and Ṯaʿlab, between each other and with the points of controversy
found in the Kitāb al-ʾInṣāf of Ibn al-ʾAnbārī (d. 577/1181), he demonstrates the
absurdity of Weil’s hypothesis and proves the existence of a strict textual rela-
tion between early grammatical sources and late ṭabaqāt, maǧālis, and iḫtilā-
fāt’s literature showing that at least one third of Ibn al-ʾAnbārī’s masāʾil are
actual points of disagreement between Farrāʾ on the one hand, and Sībawayhi
and Mubarrad on the other (cf. Baalbaki 1981: 24).
Rafael Talmon (1948–2004) recognizes the existence of the schools, but
believes that they were preceded by an earlier stage of grammatical teaching
that he calls Old Iraqi School and that the reality of the schools in 2nd/8th cen-
4 No mention of Basrans as a group is to be found in the Kitāb Sībawayhi and only four men-
tions of Kufans are to be found in it, three of them referred to Qurʾānic qirāʾāt, but one of
them clearly referred to a grammatical issue in which the opinion of Kufans is opposed by
Sībawayhi to the view of his master Ḫalīl (cf. Baalbaki 1981:2–5,Talmon 1997:231). No mention
of Basrans nor Kufans is to be found in Farrāʾ unless regarding qirāʾāt (cf. Baalbaki 1981:5–6).
The first reference to Basrans as a group in a Kufan source is to be found in Ibn al-Sikkīt’s
ʾIṣlāḥal-manṭiq (cf. Baalbaki 1981:6–7). The first reference to Kufans as a group in a Basran
source, except the one found in Sībawayhi, is to be found in Mubarrad’s Muqtaḍab (cf. Baal-
baki 1981:7ff.).

tury was not limited only to Basra and Kufa but was extended also to Medina
and Hedjaz (cf. Talmon 1985, 1997, and 2003).
Owens (1990: 213–220, 1991) corroborates Weil’s hypothesis again and sug-
geststhattheearlieststageof Arabicgrammarwasaperiodof linguistichetero-
geneity in which scholars were free to mix ideas, methodologies, and termin-
ologies. As for the dichotomic scheme that produced the opposition between
SībawayhiandFarrāʾ,orthegrammaticalschoolsof BasraandKufa,itwouldbe,
in his point of view, only a late (4th/10th century) strategy for the organization
and the understanding of this early heterogeneity.
Weil’s hypothesis is revitalized once again by Humbert (1995: 1–17) who
claims, on the one hand, that we don’t know nothing about Sībawayhi and that
allwhatweknowabouttheauthorof the Kitābisnoneotherthanalateforgery,
and, on the other, that ʾAḫfaš was not a disciple of Sībawayhi, implicitly deny-
ing, by this way, the existence of anything like a grammatical school in Basra,
at least at the times of Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš.
Later on, Bernards (1997: 3–18) questions even the reputation of Sībawayhi
and the authority of the Kitāb during 2nd/8th and 3rd/9th centuries, claiming
that most grammatical scholarship of the period would have been critical with
the Kitāb, at least until Mubarrad’s late retract, and thus corroborating, once
again, Weil’s hypothesis on grammatical debates and grammatical schools as
a literary fiction forged by the generation after Mubarrad and Ṯaʿlab. While far
frombeingdemonstrated,Bernards’thesisisoftentakenforgrantedinacadem-
ical circles (cf., e.g., Carter 2001; Ghersetti 2017: 881–882). In this context, very
often, it is the same existence of a scholarly circle of naḥwiyyūn in Basra during
2nd/8th and early 3rd/9th centuries that is, more or less covertly, questioned.
The aim of this chapter is twofold. In the first part (section 1) an in-depth
study of biographical, historiographical, and literary sources tries to demon-
strate, on the one hand that the reputation of Sībawayhi was considerable, if
not properly during his life, at least starting from the very first years after his
early death, and, on the other, that ʾAḫfaš was perceived as the heir and suc-
cessor of Sībawayhi’s teaching at the very least already at the beginnings of
3rd/9thcentury.Inthesecondpart(sections2and3)acomparativestudyof the
QurʾānicquotationsfoundinSībawayhi’s KitābandinʾAḫfaš’s Maʿānīal-Qurʾān
shows, on a textual basis, that both authors express a common scholarship that
can only be explained by admitting the existence, in 2nd/8th century’s Basra,
of a scholarly circle of people concerned with the way of speech (naḥwiyyūn),
if not exactly a grammatical school, of which both Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš were
obviously part.

The Biography of Sībawayhi and the Relationship with ʾAḫfaš
1.1
The Youth in Basra and the Case with Ḥammād b. Salama
Practically all classical sources agree that Sībawayhi, who was Persian by birth,
moved to Basra when he was very young and began to study Islamic law and
ḥadīṯ-s’ transmission in the scholarly circle of Ḥammād b. Salama (d. 167/784;
cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66; Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ92; Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 54; Ibn Qutayba
Maʿārif 503; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 354–355), a well-known and respected Basran tra-
ditionist and faqīh (cf. Yāqūt ʾIršād 1199), but also a poet, a Qurʾān scholar (cf.
Marzubānī Nūr 32–33) and a pupil of Ḫalīl b. ʾAḥmad (d. 175/791?) and ʿĪsā b.
ʿUmar al-Ṯaqafī (d. 149/766) in the field of ʿarabiyya (cf. Luġawī Marātib 74; Ibn
al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 42; Yāqūt ʾIršād, 1199), later on seen as a grammatical author-
ity himself (cf. Ibn Qutayba Maʿārif, 503), having been the first master of none
other than Yūnus b. Ḥabīb (d. 182/798?) (cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 51; Ibn al-ʾAnbārī
Nuzha 42; Qifṭī ʾInbāh i, 364–365), one of the main and most quoted masters of
Sībawayhi himself (cf. Troupeau 1961).
Totheyearsof studywithḤammād,whousedtosaythatpeoplewhowantto

ʿalayhi miḫlāt wa-lā šaʿīr fīhā, Qifṭī ʾInbāh i, 364), dates the first public humili-
ationdocumentedbyclassicalbiographies,bywhich,itseems,Sībawayhi’svery
interest in the study of grammar was actually generated.
The accident is described by sources in slightly different ways, all revolving
around Sībawayhi’s poor knowledge of ʿarabiyya, either because of his inabil-
ity to spell like a native Arabic speaker, or because of his non-canonical ideas
about Arabic grammar.
Theoldestaccountof thisaccidentistobefoundinthe Maǧālisal-ʿulamāʾof
ʾAbūal-Qāsimal-Zaǧǧāǧī(d.337/949)whonarratestwoslightlydifferentstories
(cf. Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis 118). In both stories Sībawayhi is writing or reciting ḥadīṯ-s,
underthedictationorinfrontof hismasterḤammād.Inthefirstone,Ḥammād
mentions the Prophet rising on the heights of Ṣafā and Sībawayhi spells it as
ṣafāʾ (purity), being harshly criticized for that by Ḥammād who even calls him
Persian (yā fārisī) to deplore his non-native spelling, whereupon Sībawayhi
leaves the assembly in anger and frustration, breaking up his pen while saying:
“I will not write anything, anymore, until I will perfectly master the ʿarabiyya”
( fa-lammāfaraġaminmaǧlisihikasaraal-qalamwa-qālalāʾaktubušayʾanḥattā
ʾuḥkima al-ʿarabiyya, Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis 118).
In the second story Ḥammād is dictating to Sībawayhi the very words of the
Prophet: laysa min ʾaṣḥābī ʾaḥadun ʾillā wa-law šiʾtu la-ʾaḫaḏtu ʿalayhi laysa ʾabā

not make some remarks, except ʾAbū al-Dardāʾ”). The text of the ḥadīṯhas an
accusative case ending after the second laysa, but Sībawayhi reads it with a
nominative case ending (laysa ʾabū al-dardāʾ) and Ḥammād rebukes him say-
ing: “you are wrong Sībawayhi, this is not correct in that way, because laysa,
here, is just [a particle of] istiṯnāʾ (exception)” ( fa-ṣāḥa bihi ḥammād laḥanta
yā sībawayhi laysa hāḏā ḥayṯu ḏahabta ʾinnamā huwa istiṯnāʾ, Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis
118;cf. alsoZubaydīṬabaqāt 66;TanūḫīTaʾrīḫ93;Ibnal-ʾAnbārī Nuzha42;Yāqūt
ʾIršād 1199; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 350; Suyūṭī Buġya i, 548), and, in Ḥammād’s inter-
pretation, being a particle of istiṯnāʾ, laysa needs here to be followed by an
accusative case ending. Sībawayhi’s reading was possibly defensible by assum-
ing ʾAbū al-Dardāʾ being the noun (ism) of laysa with ellipsis (ḥaḏf ) of the
ḫabar: laysa ʾAbū al-Dardāʾ [minhum] (“ʾAbū al-Dardāʾ is not part of them”, cf.
Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66), but Sībawayhi did not actually stand up for his own read-
ing and took the rebuke pretty bad: “Surely, but I swear, I am going to seek
some kind of knowledge by which you will never be able to tell me I do not
speak pure Arabic again” (lā ǧaram wa-llāh la-ʾaṭlubanna ʿilman lā tulaḥḥinunī
maʿahu, Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis 118; cf. also Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66; Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ93; Ibn
al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 42; Yāqūt ʾIršād 1199; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 350; Suyūṭī Buġya i, 548).
Thus, Sībawayhi definitely left Ḥammād and joined the scholarly circle of
ʾAḫfaš, also frequented by the famous Qurʾānic canonical reader Yaʿqūb al-
Ḥaḍramī (d. 205/821), by Sībawayhi’s principal master Ḫalīl b. ʾAḥmad and by
other,anonymous,naḥwiyyūn( fa-maḍāwa-lazimamaǧlisal-ʾaḫfašmaʿayaʿqūb
al-ḥaḍramī wa-l-ḫalīl wa-sāʾir al-naḥwiyyīn, Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis 118).5 The state-
ment suggests a possible role of leader for ʾAḫfaš within the scholarly circle
5 The meaning of the term naḥwiyyūn in Sībawayhi’s Kitāb has aroused some discussion in aca-
demical circles, notably after the publication of Carter 1972. For Ḥadīṯī (1967:100–102) they
were Sībawayhi’s teachers. Troupeau (1976:14, and s.v. n-ḥ-w) translates it simply as gram-
mairiens. Carter (1972) notices that most times Sībawayhi is critical towards those naḥwiyyūn
and so, while he doesn’t believe that the term designate the grammarians, nor some people
dealingwithawellestablishedandrecognizedscience,hespeculatesthattheymayhavebeen
just people concerned with the way of speech, consistently with the etymology of the term
itself. Sībawayhi would have been, thus, the first Arab grammarian, and the term naḥwiyyūn
would became the accepted technical term for grammarians only after him. Talmon (1982)
questions Carter’s interpretation according to which the naḥwiyyūn were anonymous, non-
specialist, contemporaries of Sībawayhi and believes that also Yūnus b. Ḥabīb, ʿĪsā b. ʿUmar,
Ḫalīl b. ʾAḥmad, and even Sībawayhi were part of the same group. In his point of view, the
naḥwiyyūn were indeed grammarians and, although Sībawayhi seems to reject the conclu-
sions of the naḥwiyyūn in some specific instances, according to Talmon he never rejects their
principles of grammatical analysis but, on the contrary, he founds his grammatical system on
thegroundof theiradvancedgrammaticalanalysis.Inmyopinion,theywereoneoutof many
scholarly circles active in Basra and elsewhere in 2nd/8th century. They were not all strictly
grammarians, as it is clear by the presence in the group of scholars like, e.g., the Qurʾānic

of the naḥwiyyūn, but in other accounts we are just told that Sībawayhi began
to study grammar and followed Ḫalīl ( fa-ṭalabaal-naḥwwa-lazimaal-ḫalīl, Ibn
al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 42; cf. also Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66; Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ93; Yāqūt ʾIršād
1199; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 350, 354–355).
Be that as it may, it is true that some kind of public humiliation related to
Sībawayhi’s inability to speak pure or correct Arabic is a constant feature of all
biographies: it’s mentioned already by Ibn Qutayba (d. 270/889) in the oldest,
preserved, biographical entry on Sībawayhi:
He is ʿAmr b. ʿUṯmān and he was mainly concerned with grammar, he
arrived once to Baghdad where he got involved in a public debate with
other grammarians and was humiliated […]. (huwa ʿamr b. ʿuṯmān wa-
kāna al-naḥw ʾaġlaba ʿalayhi wa-kāna qadima baġdād fa-ǧumiʿa baynahu

entries on Sībawayhi made by ʾAbū al-Ṭayyib al-Luġawī (d. 351/962; cf. Luġawī
Marātib 73) and ʾAbū Saʿīd al-Sīrāfī (d. 368/979; cf. Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 37–38).
The story of the public humiliation must be analyzed, here, in two different
respects: the reputation of Sībawayhi as a grammatical authority, on the one
hand, and, on the other, Sībawayhi’s potential quarrelsomeness and the real
nature of his relationship with the intellectual community of the time.
1.2
Sībawayhi’s Reputation
As for Sībawayhi’s reputation, it is true that classical biographies provide sev-
eral clues to the hypothesis of a possible bad reputation for the author of the
Kitābwhilestillinlife,if notasagrammarian,atleastasaspeaker:rumorswere
circulating that he may even had some kind of speech defect.
Zubaydī(d.379/989)relatestheaccountof someʾAḥmadb.Muʿāwiyab.Bakr
al-ʿUlaymī who claimed once to have seen the young Sībawayhi speaking and
debating about grammar and asserted that he had some speech impediment
(wa-kānat fī lisānihi ḥubsa), nonetheless, after a look at the Kitāb he admitted
that Sībawayhi’s knowledge was actually much more effective than his elo-
reader Yaʿqūb al-Ḥaḍramī, but they were identified by the very fact to be concerned mainly
with the way of speech. The term soon began to mean professional grammarians when being
a grammarian became a paid profession (i.e. at least from the times of al-Mahdī [r. 158/775–
169/785], who entrusted Kisāʾī with the education of his son Hārūn al-Rašīd, cf. Yāqūt ʾIršād
1738–1740).

quence (a.l. his knowledge was more eloquent than his speech), which is not
very complimentary either ( fa-naẓartufīkitābihifa-ʿilmuhuʾablaġminlisānihi,
Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66–67; cf. Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ98; Yāqūt ʾIršād 2124; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii,
349; Ibn Ḫallikān Wafayāt iii, 465; Suyūṭī Buġya ii, 229).
According to Marzubānī (d. 384/994), his Kufan archrival Farrāʾ, comment-
ing Sībawayhi’s claim that a verse of the famous poet Baššār b. Burd (d. 167/783)
wasinconsistentwithpureBedouinspeech,calledhimarealcatastrophe(kāna
sībawayhi ʿuḍla min al-ʿuḍal), a quite enigmatic, but certainly not flattering
expression (cf. Marzubānī Nūr 68).
A late source like Qifṭī (d. 646/1248) records a discussion about the correct
ʾiʿrāb of Sībawayhi’s sobriquet. It seems, indeed, that Ṯaʿlab, who, according
to Ibn al-Nadīm (d. 385/995), used to say that the Kitāb was actually com-
posed by forty two scholars and that Sībawayhi was only one of them (iǧtamaʿa
ʿalā ṣanʿat kitāb sībawayhi iṯnān wa-ʾarbaʿūn ʾinsānan minhum sībawayhi, Ibn
al-Nadīm Fihrist 57; cf. Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 347), said once that Sībawayhi was
wrong even about the ʾiʿrāb of his own name (kāna sībawayhi yuḫṭiʾu fī ismihi)
because he used to say sībawayhiwa-sībawayhinʾāḫar (“Sībawayhi and another
Sībawayhi”) treating therefore his name as a triptote when indefinite, while
Kisāʾī would have said sībawayhu wa-sībawayhu ʾāḫar, treating it as a diptote,
because, being a foreign name, it should not be trated as a triptote ever (li-
ʾannahu ʾaʿǧamī fa-lā yuǧrā, Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 352).
Another late source like Yāqūt (d. 626/1229) relates a story about Zaǧǧāǧ
(d. 311/923) who finds himself involved, in the house of Ṯaʿlab, in a debate with
ʾAbūMūsāal-Ḥāmiḍ(d.305/918),afanaticalKufansupporter,7whoopenlytells,
in order to insult Zaǧǧāǧ, that Sībawayhi was unable to speak correctly (wa-llāh

unabletospeakfluentArabic( fa-ʾataytuhufa-ʾiḏāhuwaʾaʿǧamlāyufṣiḥu,Yāqūt

servant: hāti ḏīka al-māʾ min ḏāka al-ǧarra (“bring that water from that jar”),
with both demonstratives mistaken (cf. Yāqūt ʾIršād 55–56).
This ʾAbū Mūsā, said al-Ḥāmiḍ(a.l. the quarrelsome one), is described by
sources as a very nervous and irritable counterpart:8 when his master Ṯaʿlab
mentions the story of Farrāʾ who died with a copy of the Kitāb under his pillow

his mind (wa-kāna al-ʿaṣabiyya qad ḏahabat bi-ʿaql al-ḥāmiḍ) and so, when Ibn
Kaysān (d. 299/911 or 320/932), a pupil of both Mubarrad and Ṯaʿlab who is
said to have been acquainted with both Basran and Kufan maḏāhib (doctrines)
(cf. Qifṭī ʾInbāh iii, 57–59), tells to Ṯaʿlab his dream: “I was sleeping and I saw
some jinns debating with each other on any possible kind of science and so I
asked them which grammarian was their favorite one and they said Sībawayhi”
(raʾaytu fī al-manām al-ǧinn wa-hum yatanāẓarūna fī kull fann min al-ʿulūm fa-
qultulahumʾilāmantamīlūnafīal-naḥwfa-qālūʾilāsībawayhi),ʾAbūMūsā,who
was there as Ṯaʿlab’s guest, loses his temper and bursts out: “Oh, this must be
true,becauseSībawayhiwasnothingbutanimpostorandadevilandthat’swhy
jinns have a preference for him” (qad ṣadaqa ʾinnamā sībawayhi daǧǧāl šayṭān
fa-li-ḏālikatamīluʾilayhial-ǧinn, Luġawī Marātib 105–106; cf. also Ibn al-ʾAnbārī
Nuzha 56; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 356).
Itmustbesaid,however,thatallthiscriticism,aswellasrumorsandhearsay,
comes from Kufan sources.There is no real criticism of Sībawayhi coming from
Basran sources.9
In Luġawī’s Marātib, ʾAḫfaš is said to have pointed out to the Basrans any
small flaw found in the Kitāb before leaving them (nabbahahum ʿalā ʿuwar al-
Kitāb wa-tarakahum, Luġawī Marātib 80), but the information is reported on
the authority of Kisāʾī, who is still, of course, a Kufan source.10
Bernards (1997: 3–9), in an attempt at demonstrate that late 2nd/8th and
early 3rd/9th centuries’ scholarship on Sībawayhi was mostly critical with the
Kitāb, makes a list, albeit incomplete, of anything that might be, both in Kufan
and in Basran sources, interpreted as potential criticism. Unfortunately, she
regularly misunderstands practically all information given by Arabic tradition
on behalf of Basran sources.11
9
The sole, possible, Basran criticism on the Kitāb is to be found in the manuscript glosses
on the Kitāb written by ʾAḫfaš (cf. Humbert 1995:13–17, 58–64) and in Mubarrad’s lost Radd
(cf. Bernards 1997). On both see infra (sections 1.2 and 1.4).
10
Humbert, who has studied the manuscript glosses on the Kitāb, claims that there is some
criticism to be found in the oldest layer of glosses ascribed to ʾAḫfaš (cf. Humbert 1995:15–
16). It should be noted, however, that both Luġawī’s account and ʾAḫfaš’s glosses studied
by Humbert seem much more a regular correction of a text that may well come from a stu-
dentthan a realcriticismorrefutationof theworkof Sībawayhi.On that, see infra(section
1.4).

According to her point of view, indeed, the very fact that ʾAbū Yaʿlā b. ʾAbī
Zurʿa (d. 257/871) is said to have composed a commentary on the Kitāb, unfor-
tunately lost, entitled Nukat ʿalā Kitāb Sībawayhi suggests, in her own words
“that it was at the very least [sic] a critical commentary” (Bernards 1997: 3–
4). It should be noted, however, that a correct translation for the title of Ibn
ʾAbīZurʿa’scommentaryshouldbeSelectedproblemsfoundinSībawayhi’sKitāb:
the modern meaning of nukta (i.e. witticism, wisecrack, joke), which probably
Bernards supposes is at work here, is absolutely anachronistic and inappro-
priate in this case, as clearly suggested also by the only short account of the
commentary given by a scholar who actually read it, Qifṭī, who is quoted, but
apparently not taken seriously, by Bernards herself: “not bad in terms of useful-
ness” (lā baʾs bi-fawāʾidihi, Qifṭī ʾInbāh iv, 190).
Another such criticism coming from Basran sources would be, still accord-
ing to Bernards (1997: 6), the opinion of Siǧistānī (d. 255/869) “that the Kitāb
is remarkable for its elegance in metrics and poetry but whose author is other-
wise of lesser quality than al-Māzinī [d. 249/863] as a grammarian [sic]”.
It is unclear to me how Bernards gets to misunderstand in such a striking
way the text of Sīrāfī which is, simply, a biographical account of Siǧistānī that
mentions Sībawayhi just as the author of the Kitāb that Siǧistānī himself read
twice in front of ʾAḫfaš.
Here’s the complete text of Sīrāfī followed by a proper translation:
أخبار أبي حاتم السجستاني
.رعشلاو ةغللاب اً ملاع ،يعمصألاو ةديبع يبأو ديز يبأ نع ةياورلا ريثك ناكو .دمحم نب لهس وه
قال أبو العباس: وسمعته يقول: قرأت كتاب سيبويه على الأخفش مرتين، وكان حسن العلم
بالعروض، وإخراج المعمى، ويقول الشعر الجيد، ويصيب المعنى، ولم يكن بالحاذق في النحو.
قال أبو العباس: ولو قدم بغداد لم يقم له منهم أحد. ولهكتاب في النحو. قال أبو العباس: وكان

المازني عن النحو، وكان جماعة للـكتب يبحر فيها. وكان كثير تأليف الـكتب في اللغة.
includingMubarrad’s Radd.Wearemainlyconcerned,here,withtheanalysisof biograph-
ical, historiographical, and literary sources on the life of Sībawayhi. One thing should be
noted, anyway: Mubarrad’s Radd is now lost and must be deduced, through a leap of
faith in its author’s accuracy, from Ibn Wallād’s (d. 332/944) Kitāb al-Intiṣār that is also
a 4th/10th century’s source (as well as Ibn al-Nadīm, Sīrāfī, Zaǧǧāǧī, and so on). It is not
clear, thus, why should we suspect of any sources on early Arabic grammatical tradition
coming from 4th/10th century onward and trust solely the isolated account of IbnWallād?

Account of ʾAbū Ḥātim al-Siǧistānī
His name was Sahl b. Muḥammad and he transmitted on the author-
ity of ʾAbū Zayd [al-ʾAnṣārī, d. 215/830?], ʾAbū ʿUbayda [d. 207/825] and
ʾAṣmaʿī [d. 213/828]. He was learned in philology and in poetry. It has been
related by Mubarrad that he heard Siǧistānī say: “I read Sībawayhi’s Kitāb
twice in front of ʾAḫfaš.” And [Siǧistānī] was well-versed in metrics, able
in the solution of enigmas and in the production of poems from both the
formal and semantic point of view, but he was not so skilled in grammar.
It has been said by Mubarrad that if Siǧistānī had gone to Baghdad none
would have stood up out of respect for his authority. And he wrote a book
ongrammar.IthasbeenrelatedbyMubarradthatwheneverSiǧistānīmet
Māzinī in the house of ʿĪsā b. Ǧaʿfar al-Hāšimī [dates unknown], he pre-
tended like he was busy or he had to leave, fearing that Māzinī could ask
him about some grammatical question. And he was a collector of books
in which he loved to get lost. And he composed many books on philology.
It has been said by Mubarrad: “I went to Siǧistānī when I was young
and I saw what was enough for me to leave his scholarly circle [i.e. things
I didn’t like], and so I dropped out of it for a while, but later I went
back and I proposed him an enigma on a poetic verse of Hārūn al-Rašīd
and [Siǧistānī] solved it perfectly and answered: […]” (follows the poetic
answer by which Siǧistānī solves the enigma, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 70–71).12
As it can easily be noticed by looking at the whole text, Mubarrad, in the text
of Sīrāfī, did absolutely not say that for Siǧistānī Sībawayhi was not so skilled
in grammar as Māzinī (as argued by Bernards), but that Siǧistānī himself was
not so skilled in grammar and that whenever he met Māzinī he pretended to be
busy or that he had to leave, fearing that Māzinī could ask him about grammar.
And Siǧistānī (certainly not Sībawayhi) is the one who is able in the solution of
enigmas and in the production of poems as it is clearly shown by the end of the
text in which Siǧistānī’s poetic solution of the enigma proposed by Mubarrad
is reported.
12
Cf. also Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 145–146; Suyūṭī Buġya i, 606 in which the two sentences are
not even one after the other, being clearly two different short texts about the same scholar,
i.e. Siǧistānī.

Finally, for Bernards (1997: 6), another element to be read as Basran criticism
on the Kitāb is the account of ʾAbū ʾIsḥāq al-Ziyādī (d. 249/863) who “is said to
have read parts of the Kitāb Sībawayh but never finished it; he wrote a short
critical [sic] commentary in which he presented some points of disagreements
with the Kitāb”. Now, it is true that Ziyādī composed a commentary on selected
problems (nukat doesn’t mean critical) found in the Kitāb in which he is said
to have expressed some points of disagreement with it (wa-lahu nukat fī kitāb
sībawayhi wa-ḫilāf lahu fī mawāḍiʿ) which were already explained by Sīrāfī in
his own commentary on the Kitāb (qad ḏakarnāhā fī šarḥihi), but the reason
why he didn’t actually finish it is most probably that he couldn’t get to com-
plete such a challenging and tricky reading ( fa-lam yutimmahu, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār
67; cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 157),13 not else.14
In Basran biographical and historiographical sources, indeed, Sībawayhi is
always represented with rather enthusiastic statements.
For Luġawī, Sībawayhi was “the most learned of men in grammar after Ḫalīl
and the Book he composed is called by people the Qurʾān of grammar” (wa-
huwa ʾaʿlam al-nās fī al-naḥw baʿd al-ḫalīl wa-ʾallafa kitābahu allaḏī sammāhu
al-nās qurʾān al-naḥw, Luġawī Marātib 73).
For Ibn al-Nadīm, “nothing, either before it or afterwards, can outmatch
or even just match the Kitāb” (lam yasbiqhu ʾilā miṯlihi ʾaḥad qablahu wa-lam
yalḥaq bihi baʿdahu, Ibn al-Nadīm Fihrist 57; cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 55; Qifṭī
ʾInbāh ii, 347).
13
Cf. also Yāqūt ʾIršād 67–68 where Ziyādī is said to have read the Kitāb Sībawayhi with
Sībawayhihimself withouthavingfinishedit(qaraʾakitābsībawayhiʿalāsībawayhiwa-lam
yutimmahu, Yāqūt ʾIršād 67), and he is said to have composed a commentary on selected
problems found in the Kitāb Sībawayhi (Šarḥnukat Kitāb Sībawayhi) which, in another
manuscript, is said to have been a commentary on a third of what is found in the Kitāb
Sībawayhi (ŠarḥṯulṯKitāb Sībawayhi, Yāqūt ʾIršād 68, cf. fn. 2).
14
The point, here, is not to demonstrate that there never was any kind of criticism towards
SībawayhicomingfromBasran,orKufan,sources.Rather,itseemsreasonablethatif gram-
marians, during 2nd/8th and 3rd/9th centuries expressed some point of disagreement
toward the Kitāb, this, far from being the sign of a bad reputation for the author of the
Kitāb, demonstrate, on the contrary, that Sībawayhi became immediately the unavoid-
able point of reference for anyone wishing to debate about grammar. If the Arabic tradi-
tion relates the existence of no less than 20 between commentaries on full text (šurūḥ,
tafāsīr), selected problems (nukat, ʿuyūn), introductory section alone (risāla), difficult
words(ġarāʾib),commentariesandexplanationsof poeticlociprobantes(šawāhid,ʾabyāt),
introductions (mudḫalāt),critical refutations(rudūd), and rebuttals of mentioned critical
refutations (iʿtirāḍāt), all produced between the end of 2nd/8th and the end of 3rd/9th
centuries (cf. Sezgin 1984:58–59), this means precisely that the work of Sībawayhi did
arouse much interest already in the earliest period of its textual history.

Ibn Sallām al-Ǧumaḥī (d. 231/845?) is reported to have said once that Sība-
wayhi was the best of men (ġāya fī al-ḫalq) and his Book on grammar a guide
for mankind (wa-kitābuhu fī al-naḥw huwa al-ʾimām fīhi, Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha
55; cf. Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 355–356), and, according to Sīrāfī, it seems that in Basra, as
soon as it was said that someone read “the Book”, it was clear to anyone that the
KitābSībawayhiwasintendedwiththat(wa-kānayuqālufīal-baṣraqaraʾafulān
al-kitāb fa-yuʿlamu ʾannahu kitāb sībawayhi, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 39, cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī
Nuzha 55; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 351).
When Ǧāḥiẓ(d. 255/868–869), who, according to Ibn Ḫallikān (d. 681/1282)
used to say that “no one has ever written a book on grammar like the Kitāb and
all subsequent books owe a debt with it” (lam yaktub al-nās fī al-naḥw kitāban
miṯlahuwa-ǧamīʿkutubal-nāsʿalayhiʿiyāl,IbnḪallikānWafayātiii,463;cf.Qifṭī
ʾInbāh ii, 351), wants to impress his host, the famous vizir Muḥammad b. ʿAbd
al-Malik al-Zayyāt (d. 233/847) (cf. ḪaṭībTaʾrīḫiii, 593–596), with a unique gift,
he doesn’t find anything better than a copy of the Kitāb itself ( fa-lamʾaraʾašraf
min hāḏā al-kitāb, Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 55; cf. Yāqūt ʾIršād 2127; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii,
351; Ibn Ḫallikān Wafayāt iii, 463).
Even Ḫalīl, the main master of Sībawayhi, unanimously seen as the genius
andfounderof mostgrammaticalandlinguisticsciences,accordingtothetesti-
mony of Ibn al-Naṭṭāḥ(d. 252/866), would have welcomed once Sībawayhi into
his house with the greatest honors, saying: “greetings to a guest you never get
bored with” (marḥaban li-zāʾir lā yumallu, ZubaydīṬabaqāt 67; cf.TanūḫīTaʾrīḫ
94; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 352; Ibn Ḫallikān Wafayāt iii, 463–464; Suyūṭī Buġya ii, 229),
and, in a discussion between Ḫalīl, Yūnus, Sībawayhi and Farrāʾ about Q. 19/69,
Zaǧǧāǧī states that the most correct between Basran opinions is the one advoc-
ated by Sībawayhi (cf. Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis 231–232).
There is an interesting story narrated in the second part of Ibn Qutayba’s
oldest biographical account on Sībawayhi and reported on the authority
of Siǧistānī. It seems that ʾAbū Zayd al-ʾAnṣārī said once that Sībawayhi used
to frequent his scholarly circle when he was a young boy with two sidelocks
in the hair and he assured that whenever Sībawayhi says “I was told that by
someone whose Arabic I trust” he means with that ʾAbū Zayd himself (kāna
sībawayhi ġulāman yaʾtī maǧlisī wa-lahu ḏuʾābatān qāla wa-ʾiḏā samiʿtahu
yaqūlu ʾaḫbaranī man ʾaṯiqu bi-ʿarabiyyatihi fa-ʾinnamā yurīdunī, Ibn Qutayba
Maʿārif 503; cf. Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ98; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 350). The same story is related,
about one century later, by Sīrāfī and Marzubānī who add, very appositely,
that ʾAbū Zayd used to say that in order to boast (ka-l-muftaḫir, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār
37; cf. Marzubānī Nūr 68), which seems reasonable, but the story in itself
must have been very old, being quoted already in Ibn Qutayba short entry on
Sībawayhi.

Sometimes even the Kufan counterpart is involved in this process of glori-
fication, and so, if Sībawayhi’s archrival Kisāʾī is said to have hounded ʾAḫfaš
to read him the Kitāb or teach him to read it (ǧaʾanā al-kisāʾī ʾilā al-baṣra fa-
saʾalanī ʾan ʾaqraʾa ʿalayhi ʾaw ʾuqriʾahu kitāb sībawayhi) and have finally paid
him fifty dinars to do it ( fa-faʿaltu fa-waǧǧaha ʾilayya ḫamsīn dīnāran, Sīrāfī
ʾAḫbār 40; cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 73; Marzubānī Nūr 68; Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ86; Yāqūt
ʾIršād 1375, 2126–2127; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 40, 350), Kisāʾī’s most outstanding pupil,
as well as the other main rival of both Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš, the Kufan leader
Farrāʾ, is said to have died with a copy of the Kitāb under his pillow (māta al-
farrāʾ wa-taḥta raʾsihi kitāb sībawayhi, Luġawī Marātib 105).
Now, it could be said that most of these statements come from relatively
late sources, but the admiration for the Kitāb and his author must have
spread rather early if Ǧāḥiẓ(b. 160/776?), who was born in Basra some
twenty years before the death of Sībawayhi, already mentions him as the
symbol of grammatical knowledge in his al-Bayān wa-l-tabyīn when he tells
the story of an aspirant teacher of the sons of ʿAttāb b. ʾAsīd (d. 23/644?) who
finds one of ʿAttāb’s descendants reading the Kitāb Sībawayhi and rebukes
him courteously saying “Shame on you, this is a knowledge for preceptors
and a concern for indigent people” (wa-marra raǧul min qurayš bi-fatan
min wuld ʿattāb b. ʾasīd wa-huwa yaqraʾu kitāb sībawayhi fa-qāla ʾuff lakum
ʿilm al-muʾaddibīn wa-himmat al-muḥtāǧīn, ǦāḥiẓBayān i, 402–403, cf. Yāqūt
ʾIršād 32), placing, therefore, grammatical studies out of princes’ needs, but
the Kitāb Sībawayhi right at the center of grammatical studies. Sībawayhi is
mentioned twice also in Ǧāḥiẓ’s Kitāb al-Ḥayawān, once as a transmitter of
poetry (cf. ǦāḥiẓḤayawān iii, 497), and once as a representative of Basran
excellence “this book is not […] on the supremacy of Basra over Kufa, nor
on the supremacy of Sībawayhi over Kisāʾī” (wa-laysa hāḏā al-kitāb […] fī taf-
ḍīl al-baṣra ʿalā al-kūfa […] wa-lā fī tafḍīl sībawayhi ʿalā al-kisāʾī, ǦāḥiẓḤay-
awān vii, 7), within an impressive list of names that represents very well
the accepted canon of Arabic and Islamic civilization in late 2nd/8th and
early 3rd/9th centuries, from ʿAlī b. ʾAbī Ṭālib (d. 40/661) and ʿUṯmān b. ʿAffān
(d. 35/656) to Mālik b. ʾAnas (d. 179/795) and ʾAbū Ḥanīfa (d. 150/767), from
Imruʾ al-Qays (d. 540? ce) and Nābiġa (d. 604 ce) to, indeed, Sībawayhi and
Kisāʾī.
Even Ibn Sallām al-Ǧumaḥī (b. 139/756), who was a Basran contemporary of
Sībawayhi, and whose father had studied with the pioneers of Arabic grammat-
ical studies, quotes Sībawayhi directly in the introductory section of his Kitāb
Ṭabaqāt fuḥūl al-šuʿarāʾ for having consulted him about the correct reading of
Q. 6/27, without even feeling the need to introduce the reader to his personality
(cf. Ibn Sallām Ṭabaqāt 19–20).15

Finally, Ibn Qutayba (b. 213/828), who was born in Kufa some thirty years
after the death of Sībawayhi, devotes to him a full biographical entry in his
Maʿārif (cf. Ibn Qutayba Maʿārif 544), thus including him among the greatest
personalities of the previous century.

Sībawayhi’s Relationship with the Intellectual Community
and the masʾala zunbūriyya
As for Sībawayhi’s potential quarrelsomeness and his relationship with the
intellectual community of the time we also have several indications that he
mayhavehadaverybadcharacter.Clashesordiscussionsarereportedbetween
Sībawayhiandseveralgrammariansof hisgenerationandevenof previousgen-
erations, including members of both Basran and Kufan sides.
According to extant sources, actually, it seems that the whole circle of Bas-
ran naḥwiyyūn was a very quarrelsome group. We are continuously told of
discussions, debates, disputes and clashes, which often led to strong posi-
tion statements, personal insults and furious outbursts in the public arena,
involving the presence in turn of grammarians, philologists, poets, pure nat-
ive Arabic speaker judges (i.e. Bedouins), theologians, traditionists, exegetes,
qāḍī-s, faqīh-s, emirs and vizirs. The whole 2nd/8th and 3rd/9th centuries’
Islamic society seems to have been living in a kind of great, all-embracing, and
endless debate on any possible kind of science and theory, and grammar was,
of course,oneof themainissuesatdebate,andnotonlywithinthenaḥwiyyūn’s
circle,beingfundamentalintheinterpretationof Qurʾān,ḥadīṯ,poetry,andlaw.
It is important not to underestimate, however, the role played in the shaping
of this framework by the narrative needs of a literary genre particularly wide-
spread in the Abbasid era, and through which lives of grammarians of 2nd/8th
and 3rd/9th centuries are often narrated, the iḫtilāfāt al-nuḥāt, that is the dis-
putes of grammarians.
The genre shall be placed, at a closer look, in a wider literary canon, that
is the intellectual dispute (munāẓara, muǧādala), well attested in classical
Arabic and Islamic culture, and probably part of a common Mediterranean
substratum (cf. Capezzone 1998).

The most famous of those disputes is the well-known masʾala zunbūriyya
(“the case of the scorpion”) that took place at the court of the Barmekid vizir
Yaḥyā b. Ḫālid (d. 190/806) in Baghdad.16
In the oldest, complete, extant account, related by Zaǧǧāǧī on the author-
ity of both Ṯaʿlab and Mubarrad, who in turn transmitted it on the authority
of Farrāʾ, we are told that when Sībawayhi arrived in Baghdad he had a first
clash at the court of Yaḥyā b. Ḫālid with ʾAḥmar (d. 180/796 or 194/809)17 and
Farrāʾ, who are reported to have been very rude with him at the point that
Sībawayhi refused to debate with anyone else but their leader Kisāʾī (hāḏā sūʾ
ʾadab […] lastu ʾukallimukumā ʾaw yaḥḍura ṣāḥibukumā ḥattā ʾunāẓirahu, Zaǧ-
ǧāǧī Maǧālis 9).
Unfortunately, the clash with Kisāʾī (a particularly sophisticated debate
about the formal correctness of utterances with two nominative case endings
or with a nominative case ending followed by an accusative case ending in
some particular nominal sentences introduced by ʾiḏā) seems to have been
particularly tough, up to the point that Bedouin judges were called to decide
whichpositionwasthemostcorrectone(i.e.themostcorrectaccordingtopure
Bedouin Arabic).18 It seems that Bedouin judges corroborated Kisāʾī’s position,
but rumors began to circulate that Kisāʾī may have bribed Bedouin judges (wa-
ruwiya ʾannahum ʾuʿṭū ʿalā mutābaʿat al-kisāʾī ǧuʿlan, Ibn al-ʾAnbārī ʾInṣāf 564;
cf. Yāqūt ʾIršād 2123), and, in later versions, anecdotes of an alleged inability
of Bedouin judges to even pronounce Kisāʾī’s wrong utterance were added (al-
qawl qawl al-kisāʾī wa-lam yanṭuqū bi-l-naṣb, Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī Muġnī i, 79;
cf. Ibn Ḫallikān Wafayāt iii, 464).
Be that as it may, it is difficult for us to know the reality of the situation, but
the authenticity of the clash is out of doubt if the topos of the rivalry between
Sībawayhi and Kisāʾī is already well established at the times of Ǧāḥiẓ(wa-laysa
hāḏāal-kitāb[…] fītafḍīlsībawayhiʿalāal-kisāʾī, ǦāḥiẓḤayawān vii, 4; cf. Baal-
baki 2008: 298) and if the clash itself is already related in its broad outlines by
Ibn Qutayba (wa-kāna qadima baġdād fa-ǧamaʿa baynahu wa-bayna ʾaṣḥāb al-
naḥwfa-ʾustuḏilla, Ibn Qutayba Maʿārif 544).The early account of Ibn Qutayba

The dispute is very well-known and has been widely discussed in scholarly literature. Cf.,
e.g., Fischer 1922; Blau 1963; Talmon 1986; Fiedler 2012; Edzard 2017.

It is unclear whether he was the famous Kufan grammarian Ḫalaf al-ʾAḥmar (d. 180/796),
as asserted by Talmon (1986:136), or ʿAlī b. Ḥasan al-ʾAḥmar (d. 194/809), a friend of Kisāʾī,
as asserted by Bernards (1997:6).

seems to confirm the defeat of Sībawayhi, but the hypothesis that Kisāʾī may
have bribed Bedouin judges cannot be totally ruled out if we think that Kisāʾī
was very rich and powerful in Baghdad and that his position as the teacher of
Hārūn al-Rašīd, later entrusted by the caliph also with the education of his
two sons ʾAmīn and Maʾmūn, and finally promoted among Rašīd’s personal
companions and confidants (cf. Yāqūt ʾIršād 1738–1740), might probably have
allowed him to have such an influence on judges.
Other sources relate that Sībawayhi had even other clashes and debates,
with ʾAṣmaʿī (cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 68), with Ḫalīl, Yūnus, and Farrāʾ (cf. Zaǧǧāǧī
Maǧālis 231–232), and, most interesting, even with his pupil ʾAḫfaš who, in the
account of Ibn al-Nadīm, is mentioned along with Kisāʾī as one of the gram-
marians with whom Sībawayhi had clashes and by whom was defeated when
he went to visit Yaḥyā b. Ḫālid in Baghdad (kāna wurūduhu al-ʿirāq qāṣidan
yaḥyāb.ḫālid fa-ǧumiʿabaynahuwa-baynaal-kisāʾīwa-l-ʾaḫfašfa-nāẓarāhuwa-

Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš: A Controversial Relationship
The role of ʾAḫfaš in the life of Sībawayhi and the real nature of the relationship
between the two scholars is not obviously clear: classical biographical sources
are inconsistent about that.
Most times, indeed, we are just told that ʾAḫfaš was a student of Sībawayhi
(ʾaḫaḏa ʿan sībawayhi, Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 72; Ibn al-Nadīm Fihrist 58; Ibn al-
ʾAnbārī Nuzha 107; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 36; cf. Suyūṭī Buġya i, 590), or even his most
outstandingpupil(wa-ʾaḫaḏaal-naḥwʿansībawayhiǧamāʿabaraʿaminhum[…]
al-ʾaḫfaš, Luġawī Marātib 80).
The role of transmitter of the Kitāb is consistently assigned to ʾAḫfaš by all
sources.Moreover,ʾAḫfašissaidtohavebeentheonlyextantaccesstothe Kitāb
of Sībawayhi, and this because nobody is known to have read the Kitāb in front
of Sībawayhi or to have been taught it by him, nevertheless, when Sībawayhi
died,the Kitābwasreadatthepresenceof ʾAḫfaš,andbetweenthosewhodidso
there would have been Ǧarmī (d. 225/839), Māzinī and even others, unnamed,
scholars(wa-l-ṭarīqʾilākitābsībawayhial-ʾaḫfašwa-ḏālikaʾannakitābsībawayhi

the one who actually used to spend time discussing, explaining, and clarify-
ing the meanings of the Kitāb (wa-huwa allaḏī takallama ʿalā kitāb sībawayhi
wa-šaraḥahu wa-bayyanahu, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 39; cf. Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 39) but, in one

source, ʾAḫfaš is also said to have been the one who pointed out to the Basran
any small flaw found in the Kitāb before leaving them (nabbahahum ʿalā ʿuwar
al-kitāb wa-tarakahum, Luġawī Marātib 80).
In other cases, however, the role of student, sole transmitter and comment-
ator of the book of his master, gives way to more nuanced definitions, and
so ʾAḫfaš is said to have been a companion, or a fellow scholar, of Sībawayhi
(al-ʾaḫfaš ṣāḥib sībawayhi, Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis 124), still the most skilled one, as
it is added in most cases (wa-huwa ʾaḥḏaq ʾaṣḥāb sībawayhi, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 38–
39; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 354). We are told in some sources that they were studying
together and, in some cases, even the very fact that ʾAḫfaš was older than
Sībawayhi is emphasized (kāna al-ʾaḫfaš ʾakbar sinnan min sībawayhi wa-kānā
ǧamīʿan yaṭlubāni, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 38–39; cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 73; Ibn al-Nadīm
Fihrist 58; Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ86; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 36, 40; Suyūṭī Buġya i, 590).
Those scattered hints at ʾAḫfaš being older than Sībawayhi achieve perhaps
their natural conclusion in the story of an alleged clash between Sībawayhi and
ʾAḫfaš.
In the oldest preserved account, related by Sīrāfī on the authority of Mubar-
rad, when Sībawayhi became the most outstanding personality of their circle,
ʾAḫfaš went to see him and challenged him to a public debate ( fa-ǧāʾahu al-
ʾaḫfaš yunāẓiruhu baʿd ʾan baraʿa, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 38; cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 57;
Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 40, 353). We are not told exactly how the clash ended up, but, in
this case, it seems that a friendly solution was found: ʾAḫfaš told Sībawayhi that
he had challenged him only to gain some knowledge, and Sībawayhi replied
that no one could think that he had doubted of that ( fa-qāla lahu al-ʾaḫfaš
ʾinnamā nāẓartuka li-ʾastafīda lā li-ġayrihi fa-qāla sībawayhi ʾa-turānī ʾašukku
fī hāḏā, Sīrāfī ʾAḫbār 38; cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 57; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 40, 353).
It is not totally clear if this one is the same clash referred to by Ibn al-Nadīm,
but the context (the court of Yaḥyā b. Ḫālid in Baghdad and ʾAḫfaš mentioned
immediately after Kisāʾī) in which is placed the story in the Fihrist seems to
suggest that there might have been even a less friendly clash between the two
scholars, once in Baghdad (cf. Ibn al-Nadīm Fihrist 57).
In some later sources, finally, we are even told that ʾAḫfaš may have tried
to assume for himself the authorship of the Kitāb. In the accounts of Ibn al-
ʾAnbārī and Yāqūt, related on the authority of Mubarrad, this would be the
actual reason why Ǧarmī and Māzinī read the Kitāb in front of him (cf. Ibn
al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 108; Yāqūt ʾIršād 1374). It seems, indeed, that ʾAḫfaš was so
fascinated by the Kitāb that Māzinī and Ǧarmī suspected that he might try to
reclaim the authorship of the Kitāb for himself (wa-kāna al-ʾaḫfaš yastaḥsinu
kitāb sībawayhi kull al-istiḥsān fa-tawahhama al-ǧarmī wa-l-māzinī ʾanna al-
ʾaḫfaš qad hamma ʾan yaddaʿiya al-kitāb li-nafsihi) and so they attracted him

by offering some money to read the Kitāb in his presence and he accepted
( fa-ʾarġabāal-ʾaḫfašwa-baḏalālahušayʾanminal-mālʿalāʾanyaqraʾāhuʿalayhi
fa-ʾaǧāba, Yāqūt ʾIršād 1374; cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 108). When they com-
pleted such reading with him, therefore, they were finally permitted to reveal
to anyone that the book was the Kitāb of Sībawayhi (wa-ʾaḫaḏā al-kitāb ʿanhu
wa-ʾaẓharāhu li-l-nās, Yāqūt ʾIršād 1374; cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 108).
Humbert, who has studied the manuscript transmission of the Kitāb, has
already framed the inconsistence between the character of ʾAḫfaš and the role
of the disciple and strict transmitter of the Kitāb that has been assigned to him
by most sources (cf. Humbert 1995: 13–17). Moreover, according to her, what
we are told by sources testifies only that if it is true, on the one hand, that
ʾAḫfaš did transmit the Kitāb, it is also true, on the other, that this did not hap-
pen as a result of a deliberate choice of Sībawayhi, and this because of the
untimely death of the author of the Kitāb that did not allow him to transmit
his work through regular oral transmission from master to student (cf. Hum-
bert 1995: 15). In her point of view, it is very likely that biographers switched,
gradually, from the role of transmitter, clearly assigned to ʾAḫfaš by Sīrāfī, to
the role of main pupil assigned to him by most later sources (cf. Humbert 1995:
14).
Although it should be observed that the role of Sībawayhi’s most import-
ant pupil was already clearly assigned to ʾAḫfaš by ʾAbū al-Ṭayyib al-Luġawī (cf.
Marātib 80), who was a contemporary of Sīrāfī, it is also true that ʾAḫfaš was
a free scholar with an independent personality, and the transmission of the
Kitāb does not encompass all his scholarship, as testified, by way of example,
both by ʾAḫfaš’s critical glosses preserved in the manuscript copies of the
Kitāb and studied by Humbert (1995: 13–17 and 58–64) and by the peculiar-
ity of his grammatical technical terminology as it appears in the Maʿānī al-
Qurʾān.19
Now, the oldest extant reference to the relationship between Sībawayhi and
ʾAḫfaš is the one that is found in the Maʿārif of Ibn Qutayba who relates, on the
authority of Riyāšī (d. 257/871), that ʾAḫfaš used to say:
whenever Sībawayhi was to write down something of his Kitāb, he used
to read it first in front of me, because he believed that I was more learned
than him, but actually he was more learned than me, although now I am
more learned than he was. (kānasībawayhiʾiḏāwaḍaʿašayʾanminkitābihi

The text needs to be understood in the context of early Arabic scholarly tradi-
tion,inwhichitisnormalthatalaterscholarwhohaslearnedpreviousscholar-
ship should represent, on an ideal scale, a more complete degree of knowledge
with respect to his predecessors.
This is clearly explained in Ibn Sallām’s introduction to the Kitāb Ṭabaqāt
fuḥūl al-šuʿarāʾ, through the very words of Yūnus b. Ḥabīb who, asked about
ʿAbd Allāh b. ʾAbī ʾIsḥāq (d. 117/735) and his knowledge, replies at first that Ibn
ʾAbī ʾIsḥāq and grammar were practically the very same thing, as to mean that
he was the best grammarian ever (huwa wa-l-naḥw sawāʾ ʾay huwa al-ġāya, Ibn
Sallām Ṭabaqāt 15). Asked again what exactly would be Ibn ʾAbī ʾIsḥāq’s level
if compared to the knowledge of Yūnus’ day ( fa-ʾayna ʿilmuhu min ʿilm al-nās
al-yawm), he said:
if someone today wouldn’t know but what was already knew by Ibn ʾAbī
ʾIsḥāq in his day, people would laugh at him, but, if someone between
today’s people had both his intellect and his acumen and was equipped
with the critical tools of our day, he would be just the most learned of
men. (law kāna fī al-nās al-yawm man lā yaʿlamu ʾillā ʿilmahu yawmaʾiḏla-
ḍuḥika bihi wa-law kāna fīhim man lahu ḏihnuhu wa-nafāḏuhu wa-naẓara
naẓarahum kāna ʾaʿlam al-nās, Ibn Sallām Ṭabaqāt 15).
The text of Ibn Qutayba, if properly understood, therefore, clearly shows that
ʾAḫfaš was felt, already in the first half of the 3rd/9th century, as the heir and
successor of Sībawayhi, and the very words of ʾAḫfaš, as quoted by Ibn Qutayba,
as well as Luġawī’s account on ʾAḫfaš correcting the Kitāb before leaving the
Basrans and ʾAḫfaš’s own glosses on the Kitāb, far from being misunderstood
as a sign of criticism or disrespect towards Sībawayhi, should, on the contrary,
be read as a recognition of his grammatical authority, a sign of devotion and a
declaration of total affiliation within the same school of thought and grammar
of his master, consistently with the classical Islamic vision of the progression
of knowledge perfectly explained by Ibn Sallām.

The Qurʾānic Material Found in the Kitāb Sībawayhi and in ʾAḫfaš’s
Maʿānī al-Qurʾān
2.1
The Kitāb Sībawayhi and the Maʿānī al Qurʾān: A Formal Overview
The two books are very different both in scope and methodology, as well as
in the formal model adopted by respective authors. While the Kitāb Sībawayhi
provides the earlier extant attempt at a complete grammar of Arabic language
(including syntax, morphology and phonology), ʾAḫfaš’s Maʿānī al-Qurʾān is
placed at the boundary of Arabic grammar and Qurʾānic scholarship. It can-
not be said to be a book on Qurʾānic exegesis, mostly if compared with the
exegesis of the period that was mainly of the paraphrastic and/or narrative
type (cf. Gilliot 2002: 104–108). ʾAḫfaš’s book might be said to represent one of
the oldest examples of philological commentary on the Qurʾān along with ʾAbū
ʿUbayda’s Maǧāz al-Qurʾān, which is still more explanatory and semantically
oriented than the Maʿānī. However, it still cannot be really said to represent an
exampleof grammaticalexegesisof theQurʾān,ascanbesaidforFarrāʾ’s Maʿānī
al-Qurʾān, and, at the very least, it could even be seen as the oldest attempt at
this kind of exegesis. The book is a collection of Qurʾānic readings, philological
observation on the language of the Qurʾān, with the addition of some gram-
matical explanation and even some short digressions on specific grammatical
points.
Notoriously, Sībawayhi is never mentioned in the Maʿānī as well as ʾAḫfaš is
never mentioned within the text of the Kitāb.20
2.2
The Qurʾānic Material Found in the Kitāb Sībawayhi and in ʾAḫfaš’s
Maʿānī al-Qurʾān: A Quantitative Approach
The inconsistency between ʾAḫfaš being the main pupil of Sībawayhi and
Sībawayhi being not even quoted in ʾAḫfašʾs Maʿānī and vice versa has puzzled
scholars for some time (cf. section 1.4).
In the second part of this chapter (sections 2 and 3) the Qurʾānic material
found in both books is compared in order to find traces, if not properly of a
common grammatical school, at the very least of a common scholarly ground
presumably originated in the same scholarly circle frequented by both authors
as clearly stated by all biographical, doxographical, historiographical, and liter-
ary sources.
20
Being therefore the only contemporary of Sībawayhi who does not pretend to be quoted
by him in the Kitāb, his name being only in the manuscript glosses on the text. (cf. Hum-
bert 1995:14. Ibid., 13–17, and 58–64 about ʾAḫfaš’s glosses on the Kitāb).

As widely expected, the number of the Qurʾānic verses found in the Maʿānī
isfarsuperiortothenumberof Qurʾānicversesfoundinthe Kitāb.Thisbecause
Sībawayhi only quotes Qurʾānic verses as šawāhid (loci probantes), while ʾAḫfaš
has both Qurʾānic verses quoted as šawāhid and Qurʾānic verses commented as
topicinthetafsīr.Itmaybenoted,indeed,thatthenumberof šawāhid foundin
both books is pretty close (657 in ʾAḫfaš vs 423 in Sībawayhi), and also that the
number of intersections between them (187), if compared with the total num-
ber of šawāhid is not bad (i.e. the 44.21% of Sībawayhi’s total Qurʾānic šawāhid
and the 28.46% of ʾAḫfaš’s total Qurʾānic šawāhid).This means that almost half
(44.21%)of Qurʾānicšawāhid foundinSībawayhiarealsoused(asgrammatical
šawāhid) by ʾAḫfaš.
This is the total number of verses found, as shown in the graph above:21

Two Practical Examples

Sequences of Qurʾānic Quotations as a Sign of Common Scholarship
In the chapter on the agent whose action passes beyond it towards two objects
and you cannot restrict yourself to one object without the other (bāb al-fāʿil
allaḏī yataʿaddāhu fiʿluhu ʾilā mafʿūlayn wa-laysa laka ʾan taqtaṣira ʿalā ʾaḥad
al-mafʿūlayn dūn al-ʾāḫar, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 39–41),22 Sībawayhi explains that
in such cases as ḥasiba ʿabdu llāhi zaydan bakran “ʿAbd Allāh reckoned
Zayd [to be] Bakr”, ẓanna ʿamrun ḫālidan ʾabāka “ʿAmr thought Ḫālid
[to be] your father”, ḫāla ʿabdu llāhi zaydan ʾaḫāka “ʿAbd Allāh believed
Zayd [to be] your brother”, raʾā ʿabdu llāhi zaydan ṣāḥibanā “ʿAbd Allāh
regarded Zayd [to be] our companion”, waǧada ʿabdu llāhi zaydan ḏā l-
ḥifāẓi “ʿAbd Allāh found Zayd [to be] disdainful”, and the similar, what
prevents you from restricting to the first of the two [mandatory] objects
is the fact that you just want to explain your conviction about the con-
dition of the first object, be that in terms of certainty or doubt, and
you mention the first [object] only to inform that what you assign to it
[i.e. the second mandatory object] is your conviction on who is he, and
you say I think (ẓanantu) and the similar only to make the predicate
(ḫabar) assigned to the first object certain or doubtful, but you don’t want
to make doubtful or certain the first [object]. (wa-ḏālika qawluka “ḥas-

sametype[…],(wa-miṯlḏālika“ʿalimtuzaydanal-ẓarīfa” […]).Sometimes,
however, ʿalimtu may have the status of ʿaraftu [i.e. of a verb that holds

ledge of the first object. It is of this type what is found in [Q. 2/65] wa-

or two mandatory objects) can be found in ʾAḫfaš’s comment on Q. 2/65.
According to ʾAḫfaš wa-laqad ʿalimtum means here wa-laqad ʿaraftum “you
knew”, as you can say laqad ʿalimtu zaydan “I knew Zayd” or wa-lam ʾakun
ʾaʿlamuhu “I didn’t know him” [i.e. derivatives of ʿalima can hold a single object
as in the examples given and as it is in the case of ʿarafa]. [Of the same
type are also derivatives of ʿalima in] Q. 8/60, it means yaʿrifuhum “he knows
them” (wa-ʾammā qawluhu “wa-laqad ʿalimtumu llaḏīna ʿtadaw minkum fī l-
sabt”, yaqūlu “wa-laqad ʿaraftum”; kamā taqūlu “laqad ʿalimtu zaydan, wa lam
ʾakun ʾaʿlamuhu” wa-qāla “wa-ʾāḫarīna min dūnihim lā taʿlamūnahumu llāhu
yaʿlamuhum” yaqūlu “yaʿrifuhum”, ʾAḫfaš Maʿānī 109).
And if you want the other meaning of ʿalima you [must] say qad ʿalimtu
zaydan ẓarīfan “I knew Zayd [to be] graceful” [i.e. you need to add a second
mandatory object], because [in this case] you are predicating his [i.e. Zayd’s]
grace,so,if youjustsaidqadʿalimtuzaydan“IknewZayd[tobe][…]”,thiswould

not be a complete sentence (wa-ʾiḏā ʾaradta al-ʿilm al-ʾāḫar qulta “qad ʿalimtu
zaydanẓarīfan”li-ʾannakatuḥaddiṯuʿanẓarfihifa-lawqulta“qadʿalimtuzaydan”
lam yakun kalāman, ʾAḫfaš Maʿānī 109).
In ʾAḫfaš’s comment on Q. 2/65 we find, thus, the same explanation of the
two meaning of ʿalima already found in Sībawayhi (ʿalima that holds one single
object is said by both scholars to have the same meaning of ʿarafa), the same
order of Qurʾānic quotations (Q. 2/65 followed by Q. 8/60), and some similar
wordingandexampletoo(Sībawayhi’sʿalimtuzaydanal-ẓarīfabecomesʿalimtu
zaydan ẓarīfan in ʾAḫfaš).
In Sībawayhi the Qurʾānic quotations are found at the end of the reasoning,
whileinʾAḫfaštheyarethestartingpoint,andthisaccordinglytothedifference
in scope and genre between the two books.
Many other examples of that can be found by the reader if looking at the
full list of intersection between Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš, particularly if looking for
sequences of Qurʾānic šawāhid within the intersection between Sībawayhi and
the whole Maʿānī (Section 5.3), and within the intersection between Sībawayhi
and ʾAḫfaš’s šawāhid (section 5.5).
These similarities may be said to be marginal, but, on the contrary, they’re
relevant in relation to the aim of this chapter because they demonstrate the
existence of blocks of Qurʾānic quotations followed or preceded by grammat-
ical explanation that circulated, most probably, within the scholarly circle of
Basran naḥwiyyūn and that were shared already by both Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš.
3.2
Basran Grammatical and Theological Issues
In some cases, blocks, or sequences, of Qurʾānic quotations are found inside
grammatical demonstrations by which a common theoretical background
emerges.
It is such the case of Sībawayhi’s chapter on command and prohibition (bāb
al-ʾamr wa-l-nahy, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 137–144) which has, towards its end, a
sequence of three Qurʾānic quotations (Q. 24/2, Q. 5/38, and Q. 47/15) that is
found also in ʾAḫfaš’s comment on Q. 24/2 and Q. 5/38 (ʾAḫfaš Maʿānī 84–87).
In the chapter on command and prohibition [in ištiġāl constructions] (bāb
al-ʾamr wa-l-nahy, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 137–144), Sībawayhi explains that in com-
mand and prohibition accusative case ending should be choosed for the noun
on which the verb is constructed and that is constructed on the verb (al-ʾamr
wa-l-nahy yuḫtāru fīhimā al-naṣb fī al-ism allaḏī yubnā ʿalayhi al-fiʿl wa-yubnā
ʿalā al-fiʿl), as it is choosed also in interrogative sentences, because command
and prohibition need to have a verb in the sentence, as also for question mark-
ers it is preferable to be followed by a verb (kamāuḫtīraḏālikafībābal-istifhām
li-ʾanna al-ʾamr wa-l-nahy ʾinnamā humā li-l-fiʿl kamā ʾanna ḥurūf al-istifhām

bi-l-fiʿl ʾawlā), and in both interrogative sentences and command and prohib-
ition, the underlying [theoretical construct] should start with the verb before
the noun (wa-kāna al-ʾaṣl fīhā ʾan yabtadiʾa bi-l-fiʿl qabl al-ism fa-hākaḏā al-ʾamr
wa-l-nahy, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 137).
Moreover, adds Sībawayhi, in command and prohibition this need [to
choose accusative case ending for the noun] is stronger, because if you can
still make an interrogative sentence without verbs, like when you say: ʾa-zaydun
ʾaḫūka “Is Zayd your brother?”, or matā zaydun munṭaliqun “When Zayd is
leaving?” and so on (wa-humā ʾaqwā fī hāḏā min al-istifhām li-ʾanna ḥurūf al-
istifhām qad yustafhamu bihā wa-laysa baʿdahā ʾillā al-ʾasmāʾ naḥwa qawlika
“ʾa-zaydun ʾaḫūka” wa “matā zaydun munṭaliqun” […]), in command and pro-
hibition the verb is unavoidable, and this is like when you say: zaydan iḍribhu
“Zayd (acc.) beat him!”, or ʿamran umrur bihi “ʿAmr (acc.) pass by him!” (wa-
l-ʾamr wa-l-nahy lā yakūnāni ʾillā bi-fiʿl wa-ḏālika qawluka “zaydan iḍribhu” wa
“ʿamran umrur bihi”, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 137–138).
Sometimes, explains Sībawayhi, in command and prohibition the verb may
be constructed on the noun [that precedes it, i.e. it may be assigned to it as
a verbal predicate], like when you say ʿabdu llāhi ḍribhu “ʿAbd Allāh (nom.),
beat him!”: you start the sentence with ʿAbd Allāh and you assign to it a nom-
inative case ending because of the ibtidāʾ (wa-qad yakūnu fī al-ʾamr wa-l-nahy
ʾan yubnā al-fiʿl ʿalā al-ism wa-ḏālika qawluka “ʿabdu llāhi ḍribhu” ibtadaʾta ʿabd
allāh fa-rafaʿtahu bi-l-ibtidāʾ, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 138).
Similarly, ʾAḫfaš states that nominative case endings in Q. 24/2 (al-zāniyatu
wa-l-zānī), and Q. 5/38 (al-sāriqu wa-l-sāriqatu) are a consequence of their ini-
tial position: then the verb is given [in the text] after what already required
nominative case ending for the first [elements of the sentence] because of the
ibtidāʾ (ṯumma ǧāʾa bi-l-fiʿl min baʿd mā ʾawǧaba al-rafʿ ʿalā al-ʾawwal ʿalā al-
ibtidāʾ, ʾAḫfaš Maʿānī 84).
According to Sībawayhi, if you say: zaydunfa-ḍribhu “Zayd (nom.), ( fa-) beat
him!”, it wouldn’t be correct to interpret it [i.e. Zayd] as a mubtadaʾ [i.e. it is
not correct to introduce the predicate (ḫabar) assigned to a subject (mubtadaʾ)
with fa-]: can’t you see that if you said: zaydun fa-munṭaliqun “Zayd (nom.),
( fa-) is leaving” this wouldn’t be correct, and this is a proof that it cannot be
a mubtadaʾ [in such cases] ( fa-ʾiḏā qulta “zaydun fa-ḍribhu” lam yastaqim ʾan

this is when you say: al-hilālu wa-llāhi fa-nẓur ʾilayhi “the new moon (nom.),

you give the command (wa-qad yaḥsunu wa-yastaqīmu ʾan taqūla “ʿabdu llāhi

shows you the acceptability of fa- in such cases is the fact that if you say: hāḏā
zaydun fa-ḥasanun ǧamīlun “this is Zayd (nom.), and ( fa-) is good and beau-
tiful” this would be good speech, and it falls within that also the saying of the
poet wa-qāʾilatin ḫawlān fa-nkiḥfatātahum (and her who says “[those are the]
Ḫawlān, so marry one of their daughters”) (wa-mimmā yadulluka ʿalā ḥusn al-

[…]), Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 138–139).
Also for Aḫfaš, it is not possible, when speaking about [Q. 24/2] al-zāniyatu
wa-l-zānī fa-ǧlidū kulla wāḥidin minhumā miʾata ǧaldatin “The adulteress and
the adulterer, flog each one of them with one hundred lashes”, and [Q. 5/38]
wa-l-sāriqu wa-l-sāriqatu fa-qṭaʿū ʾaydiyahumā “The male thief and the female
thief, cut off their hands”, to consider God’s words fa-qṭaʿū “cut off” and fa-
ǧlidū “flog” as a predicate assigned to a subject (ḫabar mubtadaʾ), because the
predicate assigned to a subject, in such cases, cannot be preceded by fa-, and
if you said ʿabdu llāhi fa-yanṭaliqu “ʿAbd Allāh (nom.) ( fa-) leaves” it would
not be correct, and the predicate (al-ḫabar) [can only be deduced from] the
implied [construction] explained already about [Q. 47/15] mimmā naquṣṣu
ʿalaykum “between what we told you” [maṯalu l-ǧannati, see infra (i.e. a mub-
tadaʾ must be implied to let ʿAbd Allāh be its ḫabar)] (laysa fī qawlihi fa-qṭaʿū

[and the saying of the poet] wa-qāʾilatin ḫawlān fa-nkiḥfatātahum (and her
who says “[those are the] Ḫawlān, so marry one of their daughters”), it is like
if he said “those are the Ḫawlān (hāʾulāʾi ḫawlān)”, as when you say: al-hilālu
fa-nẓur ʾilayhi “the new moon (nom.), so ( fa-) look at it!”,23 it is like if you said
hāḏā al-hilālu fa-nẓur ʾilayhi “this is the new moon (nom.), so ( fa-) look at it!”,
23
According to Qarrāʿa the meaning wanted may well be this one. In the edited manuscript,
however, it is found al-halāk (the destruction).

and then the noun [i.e. hāḏā] was implied ([…] wa-qāʾilatin ḫawlānu fa-nkiḥ

ʾilayhi ka-ʾannaka qulta hāḏā al-hilālu fa-nẓur ʾilayhi fa-ʾaḍmara al-ism, ʾAḫfaš
Maʿānī 86–87).
Towards the end of the chapter, Sībawayhi proposes the same Qurʾānic quo-
tations that are the starting point of ʾAḫfaš discussion: as for [Q. 24/2] al-
zāniyatu wa-l-zānī fa-ǧlidū kulla wāḥidin minhumā miʾata ǧaldatin “The adul-
teress and the adulterer, flog each one of them with one hundred lashes”, and
[Q. 5/38] wa-l-sāriqu wa-l-sāriqatu fa-qṭaʿū ʾaydiyahumā “The male thief and
the female thief, cut off their hands”, surely this is not constructed on the verb
[i.e. it doesn’t take accusative case ending], but it goes like [Q. 47/15] maṯalu
l-ǧannati llatī wuʿida l-muttaqūn “A similitude of the Garden which has been
promised to the pious”. He says shortly after: fīhā ʾanhārun min māʾin “therein
rivers of water”, [that is] therein, so and so. The expression maṯal “similitude”
occurs only to predicate on it what comes later […], and it is like if He had
said wa-min al-qaṣaṣmaṯal al-ǧanna ʾaw mimmā yuqaṣṣu ʿalaykum maṯal al-
ǧanna “between the stories there is the similitude of the Garden, or between
what you are told about there is the similitude of the Garden”, and it must be
interpreted according to this implied sentence ( fa-ʾinna hāḏā lam yubna ʿalā
al-fiʿl wa-lākinnahu ǧāʾa ʿalā miṯl qawlihi taʿālā “maṯalu l-ǧannati llati wuʿida

maḥmūl ʿalā hāḏā ʿal-ʾiḍmār […], Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 142–143).
It is the same in the case of [Q. 24/2] al-zāniyatu wa-l-zānī “The adulteress
and the adulterer”: it is like if, when he said sūratun ʾanzalnāhā wa-faraḍnāhā
[Q. 24/1] “A sura we have sent down and made obligatory”, He had said fī al-
farāʾiḍal-zāniyatu wa-l-zānī ʾaw al-zāniyatu wa-l-zānī fī-l-farāʾiḍ“between what
We have made obligatory there is the adulteress and the adulterer, or the adul-
teress and the adulterer are between what We have made obligatory”, and then
He says fa-ǧlidū “flog”, but the verb is given when already had passed what gave
them nominative case ending, as it is said [by the poet] wa-qāʾilatin ḫawlān fa-
nkiḥfatātahum (and her who says “[those are the] Ḫawlān, so marry one of
their daughters”): the verb is given when the implied [i.e. hāʾulāʾi] has already
governed (ʿamila) it24 (wa-ka-ḏālika “al-zāniyatu wa-l-zānī”, ka-ʾannahu lammā

of [Q. 5/38] wa-l-sāriqu wa-l-sāriqatu “The male thief and the female thief”, it
is like if He had said fī-mā faraḍa llāhu ʿalaykum al-sāriqu wa-l-sāriqatu, ʿaw al-
sāriqu wa-l-sāriqatu fī-mā faraḍa llāhu ʿalaykum “between what God has made

Kitāb i, 143).
ʾAḫfaš’s explanation of Q. 24/2 and Q. 5/38 goes very similar: as for [Q. 24/2]
al-zāniyatuwa-l-zānīfa-ǧlidūkullawāḥidinminhumāmiʾataǧaldatin“Theadul-
teress and the adulterer, flog each one of them with one hundred lashes”, and
[Q. 5/38] wa-l-sāriqu wa-l-sāriqatu fa-qṭaʿū ʾaydiyahumā “The male thief and
the female thief, cut off their hands”, it has been said […] that it is [to be
understood] as a communication [from God], as if [God] had said wa-mimmā
ʾaquṣṣuʿalaykumal-zāniyatuwa-l-zānīwa-l-sāriquwa-l-sāriqatu“betweenwhat
I tell you there is the adulteress and the adulterer, and the male thief and the
female thief”, then the verb is given after what already required nominative
case ending in the first elements because of the ibtidāʾ, and this is permiss-
ible (ʿalāal-maǧāz), as if He had said: ʾamral-sāriqiwa-l-sāriqatiwa-šaʾnuhumā
mimmā naquṣṣu ʿalaykum “the issue of male thief and female thief, as well
as their affairs, are between what we are telling you” (wa-ʾammā qawluhu “al-

And it is the same also in the case of [Q. 47/15] maṯalu l-ǧannati llatī wuʿida
l-muttaqūn “A similitude of the Garden which has been promised to the pious”,
shortly after He says: fīhā ʾanhārun min māʾin “therein rivers of water”, and it
is like if He had said wa-mimmā ʾaquṣṣu ʿalaykum maṯalu al-ǧanna “between

tion what is found in it, after what already required nominative case ending in

Finally, Sībawayhi mentions the existence of alternative readings: there are
also, for Q. 24/2 and Q. 5/38, readings with accusative case ending, and this
is possible in Arabic language, for what I told you about the strength [of
command and prohibition’s need for verbs], but the majority approved only
the reading with nominative case ending (wa-qad qaraʾa ʾunās al-sāriqa wa-l-
sāriqata wa-l-zāniyata wa-l-zāniya wa-huwa fī al-ʿarabiyya ʿalā mā ḏakartu laka
min al-quwwa wa-lākin ʾabat al-ʿāmma ʾillā al-qirāʾa bi-l-rafʿ, Sībawayhi Kitāb i,
144).
ʾAḫfaš, too, mentions the existence [for Q. 24/2 and Q. 5/38] of readings with
accusative case ending, [and this would be possible] because, he says, the verb
is semantically linked with the first element, and may be a cause, for it, to take
accusative case ending, and this is [always possible] in command and prohib-
ition (wa-qad qaraʾahā qawm naṣban; ʾiḏkāna al-fiʿl yaqaʿu ʿalā mā huwa min
sabab al-ʾawwal wa-huwa fī al-ʾamr wa-l-nahy, ʾAḫfaš Maʿānī 84).
As can be seen, similarities between the two texts are striking in this second
case: not only the sequence of Qurʾānic quotations, and of poetic lociprobantes
is the same, but also interpretation of Qurʾānic difficult passages, poetic verses,
and important grammatical issues (command and prohibition in ištiġāl con-
structions) is consistent between the two scholars. Their approach is similar
from both the terminological, methodological, and theoretical point of view.25
One particular thing deserves special attention here, the interpretation
given by Sībawayhi to [Q. 47/15]: maṯalu l-ǧannati llatī wuʿida l-muttaqūn “A
similitudeof theGardenwhichhasbeenpromisedtothepious”,Hesaysshortly
after: fīhā ʾanhārun min māʾin “therein rivers of water”, [that is] therein, so
and so, the expression maṯal “similitude” occurs only to predicate on it what
comes later […], and it is like if He had said wa-min al-qaṣaṣmaṯal al-ǧanna
ʾaw mimmā yuqaṣṣu ʿalaykum maṯal al-ǧanna “between the stories there is
the similitude of the Garden, or between what you are told about there is
the similitude of the Garden”, and it must be interpreted according to this
implied sentence (“maṯalu l-ǧannati llati wuʿida l-muttaqūn” ṯumma qāla baʿd

Other examples of this kind can be found by the reader if looking at the full list of inter-
section between Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš, particularly if looking for sequences of Qurʾānic
šawāhid within the intersection between Sībawayhi and the whole Maʿānī (Section 5.3)
and between Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš’s šawāhid (Section 5.5).

The interpretation found in ʾAḫfaš, as already seen, is exactly the same yet
given by Sībawayhi: [Q. 47/15] maṯalu l-ǧannati llatī wuʿida l-muttaqūn “A simil-
itude of the Garden which has been promised to the pious”, shortly after He

because of the ibtidāʾ (“maṯalu l-ǧannati llatī wuʿida l-muttaqūn” ṯumma qāla
“fīhā ʾanhārun min māʾin” ka-ʾannahu qāla “wa-mimmā ʾaquṣṣu ʿalaykum maṯal
al-ǧanna” ṯumma ʾaqbala yaḏkuru mā fīhā baʿd ʾan ʾawǧaba al-rafʿ fī al-ʾawwal
ʿalā al-ibtidāʾ, ʾAḫfaš Maʿānī 84).
Now, this early Basran interpretation of Q. 47/15 can be provenly opposed
to an equally early Kufan interpretation of the same Qurʾānic passage that is
found in Farrāʾ (Maʿānī ii, 65) who explains the verse as meaning: qualities
of the Garden (ṣifāt al-ǧanna) and reports, on the authority of ʾAbū ʿAbd al-
Raḥmān al-Sulamī (d. 74/693), the qirāʾa of ʿAlī b. ʾAbī Ṭālib: ʾamṯālu l-ǧannati
(similitudes of the Garden).
Interestingly enough, this controversy is related, about one century later by
Mubarrad (Muqtaḍab iii, 225) who states that the meaning (taqdīr) of Q. 47/15
is fīmā yutlā ʿalaykum maṯal al-ǧanna (between what is recited on you there
is the similitude of the Garden) and explains that those who interpret it as
meaning “quality of the Garden” are wrong because maṯal doesn’t fit in the
syntactical [and conceptual] position of ṣifa: it is said that the quality (ṣifa)
of Zayd is that he is gracious and that he is intelligent, and it is said that the
similitude (maṯal) of Zayd is like such a man, and this because maṯal is derived
from model (miṯāl)and imitation(ḥaḏw),while ṣifa [means]attribute(taḥliya)
and characteristic (naʿt) (wa-man qāla ʾinnamā maʿnāhu ṣifat al-ǧanna fa-qad
ʾaḫṭaʾa li-ʾanna maṯal lā yūḍaʿu fī mawḍiʿ ṣifat zayd ʾannahu ẓarīf wa-ʾannahu
ʿāqil wa-yuqālu maṯal zayd maṯal fulān wa-ʾinnamā al-maṯal maʾḫūḏmin al-
miṯāl wa-l-ḥaḏw wa-l-ṣifa taḥliya wa-naʿt, Mubarrad Muqtaḍab iii, 225).26
Now, if the texts of Sībawayhi, ʾAḫfaš, and Farrāʾ, read together prove the
existence of a grammatical debate about the meaning of Q. 47/15 between Bas-
ran (as a group) and Kufan scholars already in late 2nd/8th century, which
means that grammatical schools and grammatical debates existed in reality, at
least starting from the generation of Sībawayhi, ʾAḫfaš, and Farrāʾ, the explan-
ation given towards the end of 3rd/9th century by Mubarrad must be read,

here, from two different perspectives: on the one hand, indeed, it proves that
late sources on early Arabic grammatical tradition are not necessarily inaccur-
ate, not to say deliberately false, but most often accurate and reliable, when
reporting debates and controversies between schools and scholars, while, on
the other, it suggests also that grammatical debates might have been related
not only to linguistic and philological issues, but to theological and exeget-
ical issues as well, with the position advocated by Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš being
apparently more close to Muʿtazilite theological principles and to the wide-
spread opposition to tašbīh (anthropomorphism) in the descriptions of God,
Hisattributes,andtheHereafter.This,finally,introducesustoawiderandmore
nuanced perception of schools and scholarly circles operating in the context of
2nd/8th century Basran intellectual milieu.

Conclusion: The Basran Intellectual Milieu and the Scholarly Circle
of the naḥwiyyūn
Evidence from biographical, historiographical, and literary sources have
demonstrated that the reputation of Sībawayhi and the authority of the Kitāb,
farfrombeingtheobjectof criticism,assuggestedbyBernards(1997:3–18),was
establishedalreadyinlate2nd/8thandearly3rd/9thcenturies(section1.1),and
that ʾAḫfaš was perceived, and most likely perceived himself, as the heir and
successor of Sībawayhi’s very teaching (sections 1.3 and 1.4), which proves also
Humbert’s thesis (1995: 1–17) to be doubtful.
Evidence from textual comparison between Sībawayhi’s Kitāb and ʾAḫfaš’s
Maʿānī demonstrate, also, that Sībawayhi and ʾAḫfaš were indeed part of the
same scholarly circle (section 3.1), and that terminological, methodological,
theoretical, and even theological similarities can be found between the two
books and opposed, as such, to different positions held by Farrāʾ, which proves
the real existence of grammatical schools and grammatical debates between
Basran and Kufan scholars already in late 2nd/8th century (section 3.2). More-
over, the account of Mubarrad proves also the reliability of late sources about
early history of Arabic grammar (section 3.2).
A few last words may be spent about the scholarly circle of Basran naḥ-
wiyyūn. It has been the merit of Carter (1972) to have shed light on the rela-
tionship between grammar and law. According to Carter it is important to keep
in mind that Sībawayhi began to study at first Islamic law and ḥadīṯ-s transmis-
sion and only later switched to grammar “for the light it throws on Sībawayhi’s
role in the emergence of a science of grammar and for the nature of the gram-
matical system he created” (Carter 2004: 10). While this is perfectly true, it is

villano and lancioni
also true that, for the same reasons, it would be important to fully understand
the whole intellectual milieu in which Sībawayhi grew up.
We saw that, according to sources, when Sībawayhi left Ḥammād, he joined
the scholarly circle of ʾAḫfaš, said to have been frequented also by the Qurʾānic
scholar and canonical readerYaʿqūb al-Ḥaḍramī, by Ḫalīl, who was the founder
of both Arabic lexicography and metrics and by other, anonymous, naḥwiyyūn
( fa-maḍā wa-lazima maǧlis al-ʾaḫfaš maʿa yaʿqūb al-ḥaḍramī wa-l-ḫalīl wa-sāʾir
al-naḥwiyyīn, Zaǧǧāǧī Maǧālis 118; cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66; Tanūḫī Taʾrīḫ93; Ibn
al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 42; Yāqūt ʾIršād 1199; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 350, 354–355).
Now, if data collected by Talmon (1982) show that Sībawayhi’s attitude
towards the naḥwiyyūn was not so critical as suggested earlier by Carter (1972),
data found in biographical and historiographical literature suggest that the
naḥwiyyūn may well have been a mixed group of scholars with various schol-
arly interests, but particularly concerned with the way of speech, although not
necessarily, and not all, stricto sensu grammarians. Even ʾAḫfaš, who is mostly
known as a grammarian and a Qurʾānic philologist, is said, in some sources, to
have been the most learned of men in theology (ʾaʿlam al-nās bi-l-kalām), the
most skilled one at debating (ʾaḥḏaqahum bi-l-ǧadal) and to have also been a
pupil of ʾAbū Šamir (fl. between 2nd/8th and 3rd/9th centuries) of whom he is
said to have followed the theological maḏhab [being therefore a Qadarite, but
not a Muʿtazilite] (cf. Luġawī Marātib 80; Ess 2017 [1991]: 99),27 while Quṭrub
(d. 206/821), the other main pupil of Sībawayhi, according to sources may have
been the pupil of non-other than the famous Muʿtazilite theologian ʾIbrāhīm
al-Naẓẓām (d. 221/836) (cf. Ess 2017 [1991]: 46, 100).
Even from a purely terminological point of view it is easy to perceive the
interconnections between, not only grammar and law, as suggested by Carter
(1972), or Qurʾānic exegesis and philology (cf. Versteegh 1993, and Shah 2003),
but also theology (e.g. the term manzila, fundamental in the formation of
Muʿtazilite theological approach), and ḥadīṯtransmission and logic (e.g. the
term musnad, cf. Talmon 1987, Guillaume 2004, and Villano 2020). Not to say
about metrics and lexicography, both founded by Sībawayhi’s principal master
Ḫalīl b. ʾAḥmad. The formation of this group of scholarly disciplines, as well as
the very formation of Arabic grammatical tradition, thus, should be studied as
a whole, and framed and explained in the context of the scientific and cultural
blossoming of 2nd/8th century’s Basra (cf. Pellat 1953).
The sophisticated Basran intellectual milieu of the 2nd/8th century, indeed,
was a very stimulating scholarly environment in which not only Arabic gram-

mar and Basran grammatical school originated, but also Basran schools of law
(cf. Melchert 1997: 41–47) and theology (cf. Ess 2017 [1991]: 1–497), the Qurʾānic
readings attributed to ʾAbū ʿAmr b. al-ʿAlāʾ (d. 154/771?) and Yaʿqūb al-Ḥaḍramī,
the Ḫāriǧism, the ʾAzraqism, the ʾIbāḍism, the Naǧdāt and the Muʿtazila,28 the
Mirbad and the Poetic criticism of Ibn Sallām al-Ǧumaḥī, up to the Adab prose
of Ǧāḥiẓ.
It is in this context that the scholarly group of Basran naḥwiyyūn must have
operated to elaborate the terminology, the methodology, and the sophistic-
ated principles of grammatical analysis that merged, finally, in the Kitāb of
Sībawayhi and in the so-called Basran school of grammar, and it is in this con-
text that the scholarly connections that were at work beyond the formation of
bothArabicgrammarandQurʾānicphilologyin2nd/8thcentury’sBasrashould
be probably sought.

Denial, at least in theory, of the need for Imamate (i.e. for an established power) in all
those groups led Patricia Crone (1945–2015; 2000) to speak openly of anarchism with ref-
erence to theological, philosophical and political speculations coming from 2nd/8th and
3rd/9th centuries’ Basra.

chapter 4
The Arabic Linguistic Tradition after Sībawayhi:
A Study in the Profile of the Speaker
Hanadi Dayyeh
Introduction
The opening scene for this study is set in the city of Basra in the mid of
the 2nd/8th century, where a young mawlā (client) named ʾAbū Bišr ʿAmr
b. ʿUṯmān Sībawayhi (d. 180/796?) decides to collate, study and analyze the
speech of Arabs in a book that becomes famously known as al-Kitāb “The
Book”—the oldest book of Arabic grammar that we know about.1 The reas-
ons behind Sībawayhi’s decision to write this book are neither stated by the
writer nor by his later commentators and biographers (cf. Luġawī Marātib 65;
Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66–74; Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 54–58; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 346–360;
Suyūṭī Buġya ii, 229–230). What we know from Sībawayhi’s biography is that
he moved from his hometown al-Bayḍāʾ in Shiraz to the city of Basra to study
Islamic law. There he joined the maǧlis (circle) of Ḥammād b. Salama where
he was ridiculed for making a grammar mistake (cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 66–67;
Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 54–55; Suyūṭī Buġya ii, 350). His embarrassment made
him vow to study the language of Arabs, and so he did. In the absence of any
mention in the resources as to when or why he decides to compile his book,
one may speculate that Sībawayhi intended for al-Kitāb to be a manifestation
of his acquired mastery of the Arabic language, either to show his rivals or
simply to share this mastery with learners of Arabic like himself. Whatever
the reason is, Sībawayhi’s mastery of the Arabic language, unfortunately, did
not gain the acknowledgment of his rivals who continued to doubt his lan-
guage abilities and ridicule him for his Persian accent (cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt
67). In fact, the stories around the causes of his death—in what is famously
known as al-masʾala al-zunbūriyya “the hornet problem” (cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt
69–73)—reveal that his rivals never spared a chance to prove him wrong. It
is only after Sībawayhi’s death, and thanks to his student al-ʾAḫfaš al-ʾAwsaṭ

(d. 215/830), that al-Kitāb gains its fame and status in the Arabic Linguistic
Tradition (Luġawī Marātib 68; Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 108; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii, 358–
359).2 Studies in the development of this tradition after Sībawayhi generally
speak of the legacy of al-Kitāb which was never challenged by any of the later
grammar works (cf. Versteegh 1997: 51; Carter 2004: 132–133; Baalbaki 2008:
1–2).
Sībawayhi’s voluminous and comprehensive content became the main
source for the works of later grammarians. The approach to analyzing this
content, however, developed in a different direction than Sībawayhi’s. Stud-
ies in the development of the Arabic Linguistic Tradition after al-Kitāb often
speak of the attention that Sībawayhi gives to the meaning and form of the
utterance in his analysis as compared to the attention paid only to form by
his successors (cf. Baalbaki 2008: 170–195). Few studies speak of Sībawayhi’s
enunciative approach to linguistic analysis (cf. Bohas et al. 1990: 38–47). Some
others focus on the pragmatic role he gives to the speaker to highlight his
unique method of analysis (cf. Carter 2007; Marogy 2010). Quite often, the his-
tory of the Arabic Linguistic Tradition is looked at in phases where Sībawayhi
represents the beginning phase and the era of innovation while the phase of
later grammariansrepresentstheeraof rigidityand standardization(cf.Owens
1990: 54; Baalbaki 2013: 102–105). Generally speaking, all these studies speak of
Sībawayhi’s unique approach to linguistic analysis and agree that a shift in this
approach happened after him. In this paper, I will look into the development of
the Arabic Linguistic Tradition after Sībawayhi using the lens of the profile of
the speaker, the source of the corpus of his book. I will show that Sībawayhi’s
speaker is the originator and the arbiter of the utterance, a profile that was not
maintained in the writings of Sībawayhi’s successors. The study will trace the
profile of the speaker in selected works of the 3rd/9th and 4th/10th centuries to
show how the profile of the speaker as a learner emerged, and how later it was
established in the tradition. The study will pause at a unique reappearance of
the profile of the speaker as an originator in the 4th/10th century, only to show
that in spite of this reappearance, Sībawayhi’s speaker never shows up again in
the tradition and that the speaker’s profile as a learner prevails in the Arabic
Linguistic Tradition.

the arabic linguistic tradition after sībawayhi

The Speaker as an Originator and Arbiter in Sībawayhi’s Kitāb
Thespeaker,“thetrustedArabspeaker”(al-ʿarabīal-mawṯūqubi-kalāmihi)tobe
specific,isthemainsourceof the Kitāb’scorpus.3Sībawayhicollatesinhisbook
an enormous body of the speech of Arabs which he describes, analyzes and
explains.4 His approach to linguistic analysis starts with an utterance where he
begins by addressing the speaker of this utterance either directly (ʾin qulta “if
you say” / wa-ʿlam “know (that)” / ʾin ʾaradta ʾan taqūla “if you want to say”) or
indirectly (ka-ʾannahu qāla, “as if he said” / samiʿtu ʾaʿrābiyyan yaqūlu “I heard
an Arab saying” / samiʿtu man yūṯaqu fī kalāmihim “I heard those whose lan-
guage is trusted”). Sībawayhi’s discourse across his book consistently alternates
between speaking to or about a speaker. He says, for example, explaining al-
nidāʾ (vocative):
And among what becomes dependent due to verbs that remain covert
other than commanding and prohibiting [verbs] you saying yāʿabdallāhi
and all the vocative, as to yāzaydu, its cause will be seen in the chapter on
vocative if God’s willing, they [Arabs] deleted the verb because this [call-
ing] is frequently used in speech and yā substituted for the utterance of
the verb as if he [the speaker] says “yā I want ʿabda llāhi” so he deleted “I
want”and yāsubstitutedforitbecauseif yousay“yāsomeone”itisknown
that you want him. (wa-mimmā yantaṣibu fī ġayri al-ʾamr wa-l-nahy ʿalā
al-fiʿl al-matrūk ʾiẓhāruhu qawluka yā ʿabda llāhi wa-l-nidāʾ kulluhu wa-
ʾammā yā zaydu fa-lahu ʿilla satarāhafībābal-nidāʾʾinšāʾaallāh haḏafū
al-fiʿl li-kaṯrat istiʿmālihim hāḏā fī al-kalām wa-ṣāra yā badalan min al-lafẓ

yābadalanminhāli-ʾannakaʾiḏāqulta“yāfulān”ʿulimaʾannakaturīduhu,
Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 147 l. 8)
In this excerpt, Sībawayhi starts with a speaker’s utterance (qawluka) yā ʿabda
llāhi where ʿabda llāhi is dependent due to a deleted verb. To explain this
utterance, Sībawayhi engages in a conversation with a ‘hypothetically’ present
3 Carter studies the sources of the corpus of al-Kitāb and identifies six categories of data that
range from naturalness to normativeness: “The natural language of Bedouins, the artificial
language of Arabic poetry, the inherently different language of the Qurʾān, the Traditions of
the Prophet (hadith), made-up words and sentences” (Carter 2004:39). Whether the data is
natural or made up, the speaker remains the main source of the corpus of al-Kitāb in any of
the above-mentioned categories.

speaker. He first states to the speaker that the utterance is an example of
the whole notion of nidāʾ (al-nidāʾ kulluhu). Then, he provides an example
of the other forms of nidāʾ, mainly the form where the noun is independent.
Sībawayhi promises to explain all these forms to the speaker in the coming
chapter on nidāʾ (sa-tarāha fī bāb al-nidāʾ ʾin šāʾa allāh). He then starts ana-
lyzing the utterance and why ʿabda llāhi is dependent so he references the
Arabs who delete (haḏafū) the verb due to frequency of usage. He also calls on
another “hypothetical” speaker (ka-ʾannahu qāl) to simulate saying the utter-
ance without deleting the verb (yā ʾurīdu ʿabda llāhi). To further explain the
utterance, Sībawayhi turns back to the first speaker (li-ʾannaka ʾiḏā qulta) and
clarifies that the deleted verb is known by the recipient.
This excerpt is only one example of the style that Sībawayhi follows con-
sistently across his book. He is in constant conversation with a “hypothetical”
speaker who originates an utterance in a form that best conveys the intended
meaning.Intheaboveexample,thespeakersays yāʿabdallāhi insteadof saying
yā ʾurīduʿabda llāhi.To explain the speaker’s choice not to utter the verb ʾurīdu,
Sībawayhi engages in a direct conversation with the speaker of the utterance
as if the latter is present. He calls on another speaker (ka-ʾannahu qāl), who is
not present, to simulate saying the utterance in its original form. Both speak-
ers are originators of al-nidāʾ utterance: one of them originates the utterance
in its primary form where the verb is overt, while the other, although aware of
this “primary” form, decides to originate the nidāʾ utterance without the verb
ʾurīdu. According to Sībawayhi, the speaker’s choice to delete the verb stems
from his awareness that yā is enough clue for the recipient to know that the
speaker is calling ʿabda llāhi.5 In many other cases of deletion across the book,
the speaker chooses to omit a word or more from the utterance due to fre-
quency of usage (al-kaṯra fī al-istiʿmāl)6 or for the sake of brevity (al-iḫtiṣār wa-
l-ʾīǧāz),7 lightness (taḫfīf )8 and/or sufficiency (istiġnāʾ).9 Sībawayhi’s speaker
5 In a study on this speaker’s awareness, Baalbaki discusses the impact of the speaker’s choices
on the form of the utterance as in the use of the word māḏā (“what”) (cf. Baalbaki 2007). If the
speaker chooses to use māḏā as one word as in māḏā raʾayta (“what did you see”), then the
answerwouldbeinthedependentformmatāʿanḥasanan(“nicethings”).Whileif thespeaker
chooses to separate mā ḏā as in mā ḏā raʾayta, then the answer would be in the independent
matāʿun ḥasanun (“nice things”) (cf. Baalbaki 2007:5).

the arabic linguistic tradition after sībawayhi

appears in dealing with all of these notions as an originator of the form of the
utterance that best conveys the intended meaning.
The speaker’s profile as an originator also appears in Sībawayhi’s treatment
of the notion of taqdīm wa-taʾḫīr (hysteron-proteron) and ittisāʿ (latitude). I
have studied these notions in previous articles and showed that they are linked
to a speaker who is an originator of the utterance and thus enjoys an ability
to change the form of the utterance to best convey the intended meaning (cf.
Dayyeh 2019). Sībawayhi’s speaker, for example, despite knowing that the norm
for the subject is to precede the object as in saying ḍaraba ʿabdu llāhi zaydan,
chooses to change the word order and says ḍaraba zaydan ʿabdu llāhi instead
(cf. Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 14 l. 16). Sībawayhi explains that advancing a word in the
utterance is due to the speaker’s interest in uttering first what is important for
the intended meaning:
Asif they[theArabs]anteposethatwhichisof moreimportanceforthem
to show and that which they are more interested to show, even though
both together are of importance and interest to them [the Arabs]. (ka-
ʾannahum ʾinnamā yuqaddimūna allaḏī bayānuhu ʾahammu lahum wa-
hum bi-bayānihi ʾaʿnā wa-ʾin kānā ǧamīʿan yuhimmānihim wa-yaʿniyāni-
him, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 15 l. 1)
Sībawayhi’sspeakermayalsodecidetodisruptthenormandoriginateanutter-
ance that unveils a disorder between its form and meaning as in saying “Ask
the village” (wa-sʾali l-qaryata, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 108 l. 14) where one does not
ask the village but the people of the village or “I entered the cap in my head”
(ʾadḫaltu fī raʾsī l-qalansuwata, Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 92 l. 10) where one enters the
head in the cap and not the cap in the head. Sībawayhi clarifies that it is the
speaker’s drive for brevity (al-ʾīǧāz wa-l-iḫtiṣār) and his intent to expand the
language (li-ittisāʿihim fī al-kalām, cf. Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 108 l. 6) that justifies
originating such utterances.10 Sībawayhi’s speaker is clearly the sole originator
and arbiter of the utterance and is revealed as such in Sībawayhi’s approach
to dealing with linguistic notions such as ḥaḏf (deletion), taqdīm wa-taʾḫīr
(hysteron-proteron) and ittisāʿ (latitude). Such an approach to linguistic ana-
lysis, however, is not maintained by Sībawayhi’s successors as will the next
section show.

The scene in this section is set almost a century after Sībawayhi. Although the
main player in this scene, ʾAbū al-ʿAbbās Muḥammad b. Yazīd al-Mubarrad, is
of Basran origin, the scene itself is set in Baghdad where he resided, built a
career as a grammarian and teacher, wrote his books—among which his fam-
ous Muqtaḍab—and died in 285/898 or 286/899 (cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 108–120;
Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 164–173). Baghdad, at the time, was growing as a center
of intellectual and scholarly activity; and in this milieu, Mubarrad gained his
reputationasanauthorityinthefieldof Arabicgrammar(cf.Bernards1997:32–
37).Hisgrammarbookal-Muqtaḍabstandsoutamongthegrammarworksthat
we know about from the 3rd/9th century not only for its comprehensiveness
since it includes almost all of the Kitāb’s corpus but also for its approach to lin-
guistic analysis. Although Mubarrad adopts the Kitāb’s content, his approach
reveals a more direct focus on qiyās (analogy) and taʿlīl (cause) and less atten-
tion to samāʿ (attested data). This shift in focus marks what Baalbaki refers to
as a “transitory stage” in the development of the Arabic grammatical tradition
between Sībawayhi and later grammarians (cf. Baalbaki 2008: 248). Mubarrad
thus plays a major role in the development of the tradition after Sībawayhi.11
Bernards explains that it is Mubarrad’s approach to the Kitāb that contributes
to its reception in the tradition and sets the trend that was followed by later
grammarians (cf. Bernards 1997: 37).
In this section of the study, Mubarrad’s approach to the Kitāb will be exam-
ined not from the perspective of his focus on qiyās (analogy) and taʿlīl (cause)
but from the profile of the speaker as it appears in his Muqtaḍab. We have seen
above that Sībawayhi’s speaker is the sole arbiter and originator of the utter-
ance. The question of whether a speaker of a similar profile continued to exist
in Mubarrad’s Muqtaḍab will now be examined.
It is evident to the reader of Muqtaḍab that Mubarrad follows a pattern
in addressing the linguistic concepts and issues. He starts first by stating the
grammatical concept that he intends to explain, then he offers examples of
this concept to exhaust all related possibilities. To take the example of nidāʾ—
which is discussed above and thus offers a good opportunity for comparing
Sībawayhi’s and Mubarrad’s approaches to the same notion—Mubarrad starts
by presenting al-nidāʾ “and know that if you called an annexed [noun] you

make it dependent due to a verb that is covert” (wa-ʿlam ʾannaka ʾiḏā daʿawta
muḍāfan naṣabtahu ʿalā al-fiʿl al-matrūk ʾiẓhāruhu, Mubarrad Muqtaḍab iv,
202), then he gives an example of nidāʾ “like you saying yā ʿabda llāhi” (wa-
ḏālika qawluka yā ʿabda llāhi), and explains this example “because yā substi-
tutes for you saying ‘I call ʿabda llāhi and I want [him]’” (li-ʾanna yā badal min
qawlika ʾadʿū ʿabda llāhi wa-ʾurīdu, Mubarrad Muqtaḍab iv, 202), then he con-
tinues to explain why the noun is dependent:
So if you say ʿAbd Allāh then the calling falls on ʿAbd Allāh so it is depend-
ent because it is an object governed by your verb. ( fa-ʾiḏā qulta yā ʿabda
llāhi fa-qad waqaʿa duʿāʾuka bi-ʿabdi llahi fa-ntaṣaba ʿalā ʾannahu mafʿūl
taʿaddā ʾilayhi fiʿluka, Mubarrad Muqtaḍab iv, 202)
Comparing this excerpt with Sībawayhi’s excerpt on nidāʾ, one clearly finds
that the content is very similar and that Mubarrad adopts Sībawayhi’s explana-
tion, examples, and terms. One will also notice an emerging interest in stating
the ʿāmil (government) “so it is dependent because it is an object governed
by your verb” ( fa-ntaṣaba ʿalā ʾannahu mafʿūl taʿadda ʾilayhi fiʿluka, Mubarrad
Muqtaḍab iv, 202) and no interest in justifying the deletion of the verb in a
nidāʾstructure—themainfocusof Sībawayhi’sanalysis—andthustheabsence
of notions such as frequency of usage and knowledge of the recipient which
Sībawayhi uses in justifying the deletion of the verb of nidāʾ. More importantly,
there is an absence of the speaker as the originator of the utterance. Mubar-
rad addresses a hypothetical speaker whose role is to receive the explanation
and learn about nidāʾ. Unlike Sībawayhi’s speaker who is active and has a role
as an originator of the utterance, Mubarrad’s speaker is passive and his role is
restricted to learning from Mubarrad all about nidāʾ.
To further study the role of the speaker in Muqtaḍab, the notion of taqdīm
andtaʾḫīr (hysteron-proteron)—alsodiscussedabove—isworthexaminingfor
it offers another opportunity for comparing the profile of the speaker as used
by Sībawayhi and Mubarrad (cf. Dayyeh 2019: 116–119). While changing of the
word order in an utterance is in the hands of Sībawayhi’s speaker (cf. above
Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 15 l. 1), Mubarrad restricts the speaker’s choice of changing
the word order to when such a change does not affect the meaning of the utter-
ance. In a chapter on bi-transitive verbs, Mubarrad addresses the advancing
of the objects of the verbs of doubt and certainty and makes it clear that this
change is only allowed if the meaning of the utterance remains clear “antepos-
ing and postposing are appropriate when the utterance clarifies the meaning”
(wa ʾinnamā yaṣluḥu al-taqdīm wa-l-taʾḫīr ʾiḏā kāna al-kalām muwaḍḍiḥan ʿan
al-maʿnā, Mubarrad Muqtaḍab iii, 95–96). In this chapter, Mubarrad engages

the speaker in an exercise to train him on forming utterances using the verbs
of doubt and certainty:
If you say I believe Zayd [is] your brother and he [a speaker] tells you:
turn yourself into a predicate you say the one who believes Zayd [is] your
brother [is] yourself, and if he [a speaker] says: turn Zayd into a pre-
dicate, you say Zayd is the one I believe is your brother. ( fa-ʾiḏā qulta
“ẓanantu zaydan ʾaḫāka” fa-qāla laka “ʾaḫbir ʿan nafsika” qulta “al-ẓānnu
zaydanʾaḫākanafsuka”fa-ʾiḏāqāla“ʾaḫbirʿanzayd”qulta“al-ẓānnuhuʾanā
ʾaḫāka zayd”, cf. Mubarrad Muqtaḍab iii, 95)
The exercise goes on and on challenging the speaker to construct more vari-
ations of the same utterance. Mubarrad uses this hypothetical dialogue to offer
an exhaustive list of all the possible structures of the utterance and to train the
speaker on forming the various possibilities.
Such exercises where Mubarrad is training the speaker or listing all the pos-
sible forms of the utterances that the speaker may or may not use are frequent
in Muqtaḍab. One may look at any excerpt to find that Mubarrad is adamant
at relaying to the speaker every detail related to the linguistic concept he is
explaining. The speaker’s profile as a learner emerges in Muqtaḍab and its pro-
file as an originator fades away. In fact, the term ‘learner’ is used explicitly by
Mubarrad in the heading of some chapters which he dedicates to assessing the
speaker/learner “lengthy [linguistic] issues for assessing the learner” (masāʾil
ṭiwāl yumtaḥanu fīhā al-mutaʿallim, Mubarrad Muqtaḍab ii, 62–64 and iv, 59–
71). In these chapters, Mubarrad fabricates a very complicated sentence and
asks the speaker to find the operant in every word in it to test his ability and
learning of grammar. The emergence of the speaker as a learner marks a shift
in the development of the grammatical tradition after Sībawayhi to a more
didactic approach. Sībawayhi’s speaker who is an originator disappears with
Mubarrad and the speaker/learner emerges. As mentioned before, Mubarrad’s
approach to Kitāb sets the trend that was followed by later grammarians. The
emergence of the profile of the speaker as a learner indeed sets the trend and
the speaker only appears as a learner in the works of later grammarians.

The Establishing of the Role of the Speaker as a Learner in Ibn

rad’sstudentʾAbūBakrMuḥammadb.SahlIbnal-Sarrāǧ(d.316/929),thewriter
of al-ʾUṣūl fī al-naḥw, a book on the foundations (ʾuṣūl) of Arabic grammar.
Biographers speak to the importance of ʾUṣūl, mainly because of its system-
atic arrangement of Sībawayhi’s grammar (cf. Zubaydī Ṭabaqāt 122–125; Ibn
al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 186–187). Ibn al Sarrāǧ was able to capture the foundations
of grammar from Kitāb and collate them in an organized and systematic way.
In fact, he was able to consolidate and standardize the grammar activity of the
previous years (cf. Owens 1990: 54). Owens considers Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s ʾUṣūl the
culmination of the previous diverse linguistic ideas and the beginning of a new
direction in the development of the Arabic grammatical tradition (cf. Owens
1990: 243).
ʾUṣūl indeed represents the start of a new phase in the Arabic grammatical
tradition. Apart from setting the trend for the study of ʾuṣūl (foundations, cf.
Baalbaki 2013: 103), it is in ʾUṣūl that the speaker’s role as a learner is estab-
lished. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ introduces his book with a definition of grammar in which
he explicitly differentiates between two profiles of speakers: the originator and
the learner “It is a discipline that the later [speakers] deduced by examining
the speech of Arabs in order to grasp the purposes intended by the originators
of the language” (wa-huwa ʿilm istaḫraǧahu al-mutaqaddimūn fīhi min istiqrāʾ
kalām al-ʿarab ḥattā waqafū minhu ʿalā al-ġaraḍallaḏī qaṣadahu al-mubtadiʾūn
bi-hāḏihi al-luġa, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl i, 35). There are thus two speakers: a
speaker who originates the language and a speaker who learns the language
of this originator.To further elaborate, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ explains that there are two
types of ʿilla (cause) in ʿilm al-naḥw (science of grammar): a ‘direct ʿilla’ that is
needed to acquire the language, like saying “every subject is nominative” (kullu
fāʿilin marfūʿ) and ʿillat al-ʿilla (the cause of cause), that is meant to unveil the
wisdom of the Arabic language, like explaining why the subject is nominative
(cf. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūḷi, 35). Ibn al-Sarrāǧ states that in his book he will focus
on the ʿilla that helps the speaker learn the language only:
And my intent for this book is only to mention the ʿilla (cause) that, if fol-
lowed, their [the Arab’s] speech can be accessed, and to mention what is
foundational and common because it is a book that is [intended to be]
brief. (wa-ġaraḍī min hāḏā al-kitāb ḏikr al-ʿilla allatī ʾiḏā iṭṭaradat wuṣila
bihā ʾilā kalāmihim faqaṭwa-ḏikr al-ʾuṣūl wa-l-šaʾiʿ li-ʾannahu kitāb ʾīǧāz,
Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl i, 36)
After all, to him grammar is intended for the speaker to learn the speech
of Arabs: “Grammar is intended for the speaker to imitate, if he learns it
[Grammar], the speech of Arabs” (al-naḥw ʾinnamā ʾurīda bihi ʾan yanḥuwa al-

mutakallim ʾiḏā taʿallamahu kalām al-ʿarab, Ibn al Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl i, 35), and for
that he chose a style of writing that is comprehensible by the speaker/learner
“and since I did not create this book for the expert to the exclusion of the
learner, I had to mention what is handy to the learner” (wa-lammā kuntu lam
ʾaʿmalhāḏāal-kitābli-l-ʿālimdūnal-mutaʿallimiḥtaǧtuʾanʾaḏkuramāyuqarribu
ʿalā al-mutaʿallim, Ibn al Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl i, 37).
The speaker/learner is thus the target of Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s book on the founda-
tions of grammar. Consequently, the speaker appears throughout the book as a
learnerwhoistoldwhatispermissibleandnotpermissibleinformingtheutter-
ance. In dealing with the notion of taqdīm wa-taʾḫīr for example, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
lists thirteen cases where the speaker is not allowed to change the word order
of the utterance (cf. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl ii, 222–223 and Dayyeh 2019: 119–121). In
explaining ittisāʿ, he completely ignores the relation between the notion and
thespeakers’abilitytooriginateanutterancethatdisruptsthenormandsimply
presents ittisāʿ as a type of deletion (cf. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl ii, 255–256 and
Dayyeh 2015: 74–75). Even when Ibn al-Sarrāǧ adopts Sībawayhi’s content and
šawāhid (examples) verbatim, as the case in his chapter on ʾiḍmār (suppres-
sion), the speaker is present not as an originator but as a learner who is offered
an exhaustive list of all the ʾiḍmār cases to learn them (cf. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl ii,
247–254).12 The same can be said about his approach to the linguistic concepts
in his ʾUṣūl. After establishing the speaker as a learner in his introduction, Ibn
al-Sarrāǧ follows a didactic approach that offers the speaker a comprehensive
explanation of the foundations of grammar and exhaustive lists of what is per-
missible and not permissible within these foundations.
Addressing the speaker as a learner and following a didactic approach to
linguistic analysis became the trend in the Arabic grammatical tradition from
the time of Ibn al-Sarrāǧ onwards. A quick survey of the grammarians’ work
in the following centuries shows that they produced books for teaching gram-
mar (cf. Baalbaki 2013: 105). These books were intended to provide the learner
with šurūḥ(commentaries), ʾīḍāḥāt (clarifications), and muḫtaṣarāt or mūǧa-
zāt (summaries) of the Arabic grammar. Some of the books were dedicated
to taqrīb al-naḥw (“making it accessible/comprehensible”) to the learner, and
some to help memorize its rules. Ibn Mālik’s (d. 672/1274) ʾAlfiyya, a poem that

ative ways that the grammarians came up with to make it easy for the learner

becomes the target and focus of what constitutes the Arabic grammatical tra-
dition. The speaker as an originator never appears again in this mainstream
tradition.
It is worth noting that it does not appear in the “taʿlīl track” of the tradi-
tion either. This track is believed to have started with Zaǧǧāǧī (d. 337/949),
and particularly with his book al-ʾĪḍāḥfī ʿilal al-naḥw, a book that is dedic-
ated to unearthing the causes of certain grammatical concepts and issues. In
the introduction, Zaǧǧāǧī claims that his book is the first of its kind because
it focuses—unlike the numerous books on the ‘foundations’ of grammar (al-
ʾuṣūl)—on the ‘causes’ (ʿilal) and the ‘secrets of grammar’ (ʾasrār al-naḥw) (cf.
Zaǧǧāǧī ʾĪḍāḥ38; cf. Suleiman 1999: 43–45). Regardless whether Zaǧǧaǧī’s claim
istrueornot,ʾĪḍāḥmarksthebeginningof thedevelopmentof aseriesof books
on taʿlīl in the centuries to come, thus establishing a branch in the Arabic Lin-
guistic Tradition concerned with revealing the causes and secrets of grammar.
In the introduction of ʾĪḍāḥ, Zaǧǧāǧī states that his book is intended for the
learner, however a higher level of learners “and whose level in this discipline is
up to it” (wa-kānat martabatuhu min hāḏā al-ʿilm qad tanāhat bihi ʾilayhi, Zaǧ-
ǧāǧī ʾĪḍāḥ39). The learner, the advanced learner, is thus the target of Zaǧǧāǧī’s
ʾĪḍāḥ.13 In fact, the advanced learner becomes the target of later works on taʿlīl.
A glance at some of these works, such as Ibn al-ʾAnbārī’s (d. 577/1181) ʾAsrār al-
ʿarabiyya and Lumaʿ al-ʾadilla, and Suyūṭī’s (d. 911/1505) al-Iqtirāḥfī ʿilm ʾuṣūl
al-naḥw, confirms that these books are intended for the learner, particularly
one who has acquired the foundations of grammar and is ready for receiving
a higher level of knowledge. After all, using taʿlīl in the process of teaching,
as Suleiman suggests, “was seen as a kind of mental training, whose aim was,
among other things, to develop the learner’s ability to think logically and in
abstract fashion” (Suleiman 1999: 210).
It is worth mentioning in this context that this level of abstraction in the
teaching and learning of the language contributed to the complexity of gram-
mar, a fact that caused Ibn Maḍāʾ al-Qurṭubī (d. 592/1196) to write his al-Radd
ʿalā al-nuḥāt in which he refutes the grammarians’ approach to teaching the
language that is based on taʿlīl and qiyās.The level of abstraction and complex-
ity resulting from such an approach is, according to Ibn Maḍāʾ, not necessary
for the learning of the language. For that, his book is intended to discard all that
13
Suleiman highlights the interaction between the taʿlīl discipline and pedagogy. He sug-
gests that Zaǧǧāǧī’s three types of ʿilla—ʿilla taʿlīmiyya (pedagogical), qiyāsiyya (analo-
gical) and ǧadaliyya-naẓariyya (argumentational-theoretical)—reflect three levels of lan-
guage learning: a beginner level with the ʿilla taʿlīmiyya, an intermediate level with ʿilla
qiyāsiyya and an advanced level with ʿilla ǧadaliyya-naẓariyya (cf. Suleiman 1999:210).

is not necessary for the grammarians to the sake of simplifying the learning of
Arabic grammar (cf. Ibn MaḍāʾRadd 76).
It is clear that the focus of the Arabic Linguistic Tradition from the 4th/10th
century onwards is the speaker learner. The establishing of this profile in Ibn
al-Sarrāǧ’s ʾUṣūl seems to have had a huge impact on the development of
the tradition. After Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, the speaker’s profile as a learner dominates
the tradition whereas the speaker’s profile as an originator or arbiter fades
away. An attempt at presenting the speaker as originator, however, appears
in Ibn Ǧinnī’s (d. 392/1002) Ḫaṣāʾiṣas will be discussed in the following sec-
tion.

The Appearance of the Wise, Courageous Speaker in Ibn Ǧinnī’s
Ḫaṣāʾiṣ
The scene in this section is set in the city of Mosul in the 4th/10th century.
The player in this scene is ʾAbū al-FatḥʿUṯmān b. Ǧinnī, a grammarian of a
unique style and approach (cf. Ibn al-ʾAnbārī Nuzha 244–246; Qifṭī ʾInbāh ii,
385–386; Suyūṭī Buġya ii, 132). His most famous book, Ḫaṣāʾiṣ, stands out in the
tradition for it is not a conventional book of grammar but rather an encyclope-
dia of language topics intended to prove “the nobility of the language of Arabs
and its distinguished features of wisdom” (šaraf luġat al-ʿarab wa-tamāyuzuha
bi-ḫaṣāʾiṣal-ḥikma, Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 1). The book thus does not focus on
grammar, yet employs the study of grammatical notions and concepts to unveil
the special features (ḫaṣāʾiṣ) of the Arabic language.
The first and most important feature is “wisdom” (ḥikma). As mentioned
earlier,Ibn Ǧinnīdedicateshisbooktoprovingthisdistinguishedfeatureof the
Arabic language (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 1). To him, the wisdom of the Arabic
language goes back to the wisdom of its originators. In a scene on the creation
of the language, Ibn Ǧinnī refers to a first group of wise speakers who came
together and named the things around them:
And this is as if two or three and more wise men come together and
the need arises to identify the known things so they create a feature
and a name for each one when it [the name] is mentioned the named
thing is known so that it is differentiated from others. (wa-ḏālika ka-ʾan

The scene continues and shows the process by which the wise speakers
have created these names: when they see a human being, for example, the first
speakers point their fingers towards him and say ʾinsān ʾinsān ʾinsān (“human
humanhuman”),otherspeakersheartheword,learnitandeverytimetheword
ʾinsān is used the speakers would know that it means a human being (cf. Ibn
Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 44).
The scene is surely hypothetical and Ibn Ǧinnī fabricates it for the sake of
proving that ‘Arabic’ is a wise language created by wise speakers. A close look at
thescene,however,showsthattherearetwogroupsof speakers:theoriginators
of the language and the learners of that language. According to Ibn Ǧinnī, both
groups are wise and he never loses a chance throughout his book to prove their
wisdom. To him, the originators’ wisdom is evident in their awareness of the
notions of ‘lightness’ (ḫiffa) and ‘heaviness’ (ṯiqal) and consequently in their
creationof alanguagethatis‘light’forthespeakertoutter(cf.IbnǦinnīḪaṣāʾiṣ
i, 64 and Suleiman 1999: 98–103). It is also evident in the fact that they invented
verbs made up of letters whose sounds reflect the intended actions like saying
qaḍama “chew” for dry food and ḫaḍama “chew” for soft food:
And that is for the strength of the letter qāf and the weakness of the let-
ter ḫāʾ so they [the originators] gave the stronger sound to the stronger
action and the weaker sound to the weaker action. (wa-ḏālika li-quwwat
al-qāf wa-ḍuʿf al-ḫāʾfa-ǧaʿalūal-ṣawtal-ʾaqwāli-l-fiʿlal-ʾaqwāwa-l-ṣawtal-

Liketheoriginators,thespeakerswholearnfromthemarealsowise.Theyenjoy
an intuitive ability to learn the language from the originators (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī
Ḫaṣāʾiṣi,239).IbnǦinnīnarratesmanystorieswhichshowthattheArabspeak-
ers know their language intuitively (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 239–241). In some of
these stories Ibn Ǧinnī intentionally tries to lead the speaker to make a mistake
in order to test his knowledge of the language. He asks a Bedouin, for example,
to give him the plural of dukkān “shop”, and the Bedouin says dakākīn “shops”,
then he asks for the plural of qurṭān and sirḥān and the Bedouin answers qar-
āṭīn and sarāḥīn, then he asks about the plural of ʿuṯmān and the Bedouin
replies ʿuṯmānūn. Ibn Ǧinnī asks him why he does not say ʿaṯāmīn and the
Bedouin immediately replies “what is this ʿAṯāmīn, have you seen anyone say-
ing something not belonging to his language, by God I will never say this word
[ʿAṯāmīn]” (ʾayšin ʿaṯāmīn, ʾa-raʾayta ʾinsānan yatakallamu bimā laysa min luġ-
atihi, wa-llāhi lā ʾaqūluhā ʾabadan, Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 242).
The speakers/learners thus know their language as set by the originators and
follow its rules faithfully (Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 238–242). They are, however, ori-

ginators too and allowed to go by what is frequently used even if it does not
follow the qiyās (analogy). Ibn Ǧinnī distinguishes in his book between four
types of kalām (speech): that which is frequently used and follows qiyās, that
which is frequently used but does not follow qiyās, that which is not frequently
used but follows qiyās, and lastly that which is neither frequently used nor fol-
lows qiyās (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 97–99). He states that the first type of speech
is what the speaker should utter. However, in the three other cases, he favors
the speech that is frequently used even if it does not follow qiyās (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī
Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 97–99). Ibn Ǧinnī clarifies that the speaker can change that which
is frequently used (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 124). In fact, he believes that the
Arab speakers visualize the language in their minds before uttering it and know
ahead of time that a certain utterance will be frequently used so they change
it even before it is uttered (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 31–32). In short, Arab speak-
ers, whether originators or learners, are wise and their wisdom is evident in the
wisdom of the language they originate.
Arab speakers are also courageous and brave. In a chapter titled “šaǧāʿat al-
ʿarabiyya”, Ibn Ǧinnī discusses five notions that prove the courageous feature of
the language: ḥaḏf (deletion), ziyāda (augment), taqdīm wa-taʾḫīr (hysteron-
proteron), al-ḥaml ʿalā al-maʿnā (semantic approximation), and taḥrīf (mor-
phological changes) (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 360). In explaining each notion,
the Arab speaker is presented as courageously changing the utterance either by
deleting parts of it, changing its word order, adding prefixes and suffixes to cer-
tain words, changing the morphological structure of some words or even not
followingthesyntacticalrulesforthesakeof meaning.IbnǦinnīexplainsthese
notions and shows the boundaries within which the speakers’ courage may be
exercised. Speakers may not delete a word if there are no contextual clues that
would help the listener understand the utterance (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 371).
They may not change the word order or the form of a word or a certain utter-
ance either if the change is not accepted by qiyās or justified by frequent usage
(cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 382). Ibn Ǧinnī’s explanation of the boundaries is not,
however, intended to restrict the speakers’ courage but to provide further evid-
ence of their wisdom. These explanations show that the courage of the Arab
speaker is not irrational and that it is governed by a wisdom that ensures the
wisdom of the Arabic language and maintains it.
The wise, courageous speaker also entertains the ability to expand the lan-
guage. In various chapters in Ḫaṣāʾiṣ, the speaker’s contribution to expanding
the Arabic language is present in the ability to change the form and/or the
meaning of the utterance (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 18, 23, 274–275, 330, 395). Ibn
Ǧinnī speaks about a certain power in the Arab speakers’ emotions and ima-
gination which allows them to change the form of an utterance to create new

meanings (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 213–215). He also links this power to the cour-
age of the speaker (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 447). The courage of the speaker
combined with wisdom constantly originates new forms and meanings and
contributestosaʿatal-ʿarabiyya(latitude),anotheruniquefeatureof theArabic
language.
Al-ḥikma “wisdom”, al-šaǧāʿa “courage” and al-saʿa “latitude” are three fea-
turesof the ArabiclanguagethatIbnǦinnīpresentsinhis Ḫaṣāʾiṣ.Acloserlook
at these features shows that they are in fact features of the speaker of Arabic.
Across his book, Ibn Ǧinnī attempts to show that the Arab speaker is a wise,
courageous speaker who contributes to the expansion of the Arabic language.
The profile of the speaker as an originator thus appears across the Ḫaṣāʾiṣ. This
profile emerges in Sībawayhi’s Kitāb and fades away, but later reappears in Ibn
Ǧinnī’s Ḫaṣāʾiṣin the form of a wise, courageous speaker. While Sībawayhi’s
speaker appears in the Kitāb to explain and analyze the linguistic concepts
and issues, Ibn Ǧinnī’s speaker appears in his Ḫaṣāʾiṣto prove the nobility and
wisdom of the Arabic language. After all, the two books serve two different pur-
poses. It is worth mentioning here that the profile of the speaker as an origin-
ator in the Ḫaṣāʾiṣfaces the same fate as Sībawayhi’s speaker, in ultimately not
beingtakenupbythetradition.Despitethereappearanceof thespeakerorigin-

Introduction
In the Arabic linguistic tradition, there is perhaps no other book equal to the
Kitāb Sībawayhi. This work, dated to the 2nd/8th century, rendered a system-
atized presentation of the grammatical structure of the Arabic language, and
most—if not all—we know of the linguistic theorizations on Classical Arabic
is summarily presented therein.
Nonetheless, it is not only the accurate description of the language or the
level of linguistic speculation achieved that make this work fundamental for
the tradition, but it is also the noticeable impact it had on the Arabic linguistic
sciences that must be measured.
Considering the data and methods accounted for in his work, Sībawayhi’s
(d. 180/796?) approach is primarily descriptivist (Carter 1973: 146), and rather
different from the prescriptivist methods that we may find in later traditions.
Furthermore, the data presented in the Kitāb together with the discussions
thereupon laid the foundations for the upcoming tradition of grammatical and
linguistic studies that developed in the following centuries.
The Kitāb and its data are ultimately important for a number of reasons.
To begin with, the Kitāb is in itself an exceptional result of scholarly efforts to
describe the linguistic system of Arabic, accomplished by means of a meticu-
lous collection of data, which come alongside the author’s reasoning. Secondly,
the Kitāb represents a precious witness of 2nd/8th century grammatical liter-
ature and allows us to consider how the matter would be approached by Arabic
scholars of the time. But despite Sībawayhi’s invaluable contribution to the dis-
cipline, his Kitāb is not a major specimen of “organization and clarity of style”
(Owens2006:87),due,forinstance,tothefactthattechnicaltermsdonotcome
along with an explanation, and that fundamental issues are oftentimes distrib-
uted throughout the text, mostly lacking clear elucidation.
Sībawayhi’s work is in fact rather obscure especially in certain passages, and
this consequently led to the production of a number of works aimed to fur-
ther elucidate the author’s theorization. Nevertheless, the lack of exhaustive

explanation of certain matters, as well as the ambiguity that accompanies the
presentation of others, eventually produced a number of readings of the argu-
ments in the Kitāb. Such an issue is of ultimate interest insofar as Sībawayhi’s
words have been received as the foundations of most of the linguistic argu-
ments in the Arabic tradition, but ambiguity in the text may have also led to
peculiar misinterpretations.
This contribution finally aims to provide an overview of the matter, present-
ing the grounds for the text’s transmission as well as for the credit bestowed on
both Sībawayhi and his Kitāb.
1
The Background
Sībawayhi’s contribution to the development of the grammatical theories is
of invaluable importance, despite the fact that the theorizations in the Kitāb
did not merge into a fully-fledged model, which we instead find at a later
stage. It is in fact in the 4th/10th century, with the Kitāb al-ʾUṣūl by Ibn al-
Sarrāǧ (d. 316/929), that grammatical theories find their systematization in a
categorical model (cf. Ghersetti 2017). As argued by Bohas, Guillaume, and
Kouloughli:
Sībawayhihad,infact,laiddownthebasicrulesandmethodsof grammar,
while the later grammarians’ contribution consisted only in expound-
ing his theory in a more explicit and systematic form, or in finding new
applications for it. Such a linear conception of the history of the gram-
matical tradition led, in fact, to many misrepresentations and false prob-
lems.
bohas et al. 1990: 5
The systematization of a model was evidently not the main outcome of the
Kitāb. Sībawayhi worked instead toward a thorough description of the lan-
guage, the systematization of which would be accomplished only later on.
However, his description remains a major asset for coeval as well as non-
coeval studies, for the Kitāb, with its descriptive approach and aim, returns
a fairly accurate picture of both sources and data deployed (cf. Carter 2004).
The Kitāb, in fact, does not present Sībawayhi’s theorizations only, but rather
returns the outcomes of the linguistic discussions of the first and second
centuries of the Islamic era, and thus represents a precious witness of lin-
guisticarguments,presentedalongsideSībawayhi’sinterpretationsandexplan-
ations.

Both its contents and structure finally make it a substantial milestone in
the whole tradition, for its being representative of a wider linguistic debate.
Besides the evident importance in terms of linguistic description of the clas-
sical language, the Kitāb is then also an invaluable specimen from a historical
viewpoint, for it allows us to obtain some little information on the stages of
the Arabic linguistic tradition before Sībawayhi (cf. Carter 2004). Interestingly
enough, it is, in fact, the Kitāb itself that enables us to gather notice of the
grammatical activities prior to it: through the direct and indirect references
that Sībawayhi reports, we may eventually infer some details of the activities
taking place before and alongside Sībawayhi.
The environment in which Sībawayhi’s work is grounded is in fact not quite
clearintermsof composition.Nevertheless,theIraqicontext(cf.Talmon2000)
in which the Islamic sciences developed was surely the homeland of terrifically
intense intellectual activities. The cultural mosaic that characterized the area,
with the different cultural and religious groups that populated it, historically
favored the rise of a number of disciplines developed within the Islamic con-
text but that also drew inspiration from other traditions.1
However, we do not find a clear mention tothis multifaceted context neither
in the Kitāb nor in other texts, and no evident connections between the Kitāb
and previous works are available either. Consequently, the task of attributing a
certain opinion to one or another figure is particularly challenging. The num-
ber of scholars and readers mentioned in the Kitāb, according to Troupeau’s
Lexique-Index (1976) amounts to 16. Apart from these references, Sībawayhi
quotesseveralotherscholars,towhomherefersasnaḥwiyyūn(cf.Talmon1982).
In modern Western scholarship, the discussion on whether these belonged
to some kind of “institutional” grammatical school was mainly triggered by
Carter and Talmon’s works, with several works revolving around the question
about whether there were systematized groups of scholars before Sībawayhi.
Carter (1972) recognizes Sībawayhi and his teachers as the first Arabic gram-
marians. With regard to the other naḥwiyyūn, these would have been a group
of skilled but yet “non-professional” grammarians. Conversely, Talmon (1982)
argues that the twenty-two mentions to the naḥwiyyūn in the Kitāb should
be read as a reference to a homogenous group of grammarians who would be
working in different centers (cf. Talmon 1985; 2000).
The discussion on the subject includes, despite the brevity of our descrip-
tion, other important observations, which we cannot properly discuss here.
The short outline sketched, however, aims to outline the composite environ-

ment in which the Kitāb finds grounds, and describe how the identification
of the actors who played a role before and in the Kitāb is surely not an easy
task. Nevertheless, despite the difficulty of tracing the actual profiles, we do
know that these data and arguments were somewhat accepted by Sībawayhi,
and thus blended in the Kitāb, at least to a certain extent.2 The issue is thus
of absolute relevance, nevertheless. In fact, assuming that it was not Sībawayhi
only who devised the sophisticated linguistic reasoning presented in the Kitāb,
there must have been something that prompted or contributed to his theor-
izations, and this might have been firstly integrated into the Kitāb and then
transmitted alongside Sībawayhi’s teaching.
2
Linguistic Data
Sībawayhi’s linguistic description revolves around several primary sources.
Those deployed in the Kitāb consist of a wide range of data from: “1. the nat-
ural language of the Bedouin; 2. the artificial language of Arabic poetry; 3. the
inherently different language of the Qurʾān; 4. the Traditions of the Prophet
(Hadith); 5. proverbs and idiomatic phrases; 6. made-up words and sentences”
(Carter 2004: 39).
Grammarians faced the issue of how to tackle linguistic data way before
dealing with their model set-up, and this holds especially true in the case of
the language of the Arabs:
The grammatical tradition was confronted by two distinct kinds of prob-
lemrelatingtolinguisticdata.Thefirstwastodistinguishonclear,explicit
criteria what could and could not be considered as ‘authoritative’ (ḥuǧǧa)
data, i.e. authentically representative of the actual use of the original
Arabs. The second was concerned with classifying data according to their
degree of relevance to linguistic analysis, or (but from the Arabic gram-
marians’ point of view it amounts to the same thing) their status within
the general system of the language.
bohas et al. 1990: 17
Data validity, and thus their admissibility as an authoritative linguistic proof,
was surely of primary importance. Of the six sources listed above, Carter (2004:
2 For instance, Carter argues that the possible influence of these naḥwiyyūn on Sībawayhi is
recognizable in the seven introductory chapters of the Kitāb known as al-Risāla (Kitāb i, 12–
33),andthattheuseof theqiyāsisthedistinctivefeatureof theirapproach(cf.Carter1972:76).

39) gives an introductory description remarking that the first and the last,
namely the speech of the Arabs and the made-up expressions, are to be con-
sidered the two poles of authenticity, whereas the others rather represent dif-
ferent level of artificiality, although none of which productive. The Qurʾān, as
well as the ḥadīṯ-s as per they are presented in the Kitāb, are mostly referred to
not because of their being religious sources but rather as a piece of linguistic
evidence. Also, the ḥadīṯ-s are not widely employed in the Kitāb, but are found
in larger extent in later works. In the Kitāb the number of ḥadīṯ-s quoted is
rather small,3 and they would not be introduced by the more traditional for-
mulas, which we rather find in later literature, e.g., wa-fī al-ḥadīṯor kamā qāla
al-nabī. One of the readings of such formulations could be that quotations of
this kind are not considered an important linguistic proof because of their reli-
gious nature, but are rather recognized as part of the wider language and thus
presented as correct expressions.
Data collected from Bedouin informants play perhaps the most important
role in the overall description of the language. The Arabs represent a varied
group in which different elements are combined. In the Kitāb, we find several
tribal groups mentioned, and the variants and varieties accounted for portray
the kind of compromise reached by Arabic grammarians who were confronted
with the possible inconsistencies of the language they would speak. According
to the description available in grammatical sources, the image of the Bedouins,
as well as of their role as authoritative linguistic sources, is finally a combina-
tion of different factors. On the one hand, we are held up to the historical tribal
idea of the Arabs coming from the central peninsula; on the other hand, the
new value attributed to the tribes from the Mekkan area, native land of the
Prophet, is also particularly relevant. These tribal groups, in fact, had in the
meantime acquired a higher status since the Qurʾān would reflect instances of
the Mekkan variety.4
Linguisticdatagatheredfromdirectlinguisticinquiriesrepresentthefound-
ing elements Sībawayhi refers to, for both authority and amount, insofar as
the kalām al-ʿarab ultimately constitutes the widest corpus of data available
in the Kitāb. This mainly holds idiomatic expressions, proverbs, locutions, and
more importantly spontaneous realizations of random utterances in Arabic as
a result of direct inquiries. The linguistic data are, in fact, gathered from the
answers that the Bedouins would give with regard to how to utter something

properly, either directly collected by Sībawayhi himself or borrowed fromother
authoritative sources, for example Ḫalīl (d. 175/791?). Variants from different
tribal varieties, manifestly referred to, are registered and listed by the gram-
marians when differences would be relevant. Sometimes Arabs would not be
correct in their uttering, which Sībawayhi well declares in his work.5
The composition of the data in the Kitāb, alongside the data collected in the
Kitāb al-ʿAyn, does represent an invaluable testimony of the different earliest
varieties. The fact that such data were being transmitted is finally of particular
relevanceif weconsiderthat,beingthelanguageevidentlysubjecttoinevitable
changes, these data could be transmitted to later traditions of scholars.
Finally, the collected corpus of data is of major importance for its being
representative of a specific variety. If the process of standardization was to be
accomplished on what it is called the “clear variety” of the Arabic language, as
per the definition that the Qurʾān provides for itself,6 the data to base the argu-
mentsoncouldnotbeotherthanthoseconstitutingsuchvariety.Thetransmis-
sion and description of the linguistic features of this language, at risk because
of the inevitable process of language corruption of which Arabic scholars were
surely aware,7 was important also concerning the perception of the variety to
standardize itself. Being the linguistic description the ultimate aim and mani-
fested intention of grammarians, data needed to be collected and transmitted
in their purest form.

The Kitāb as a Source in Later Traditions
3.1
Data Transmission and Reuse
In the process of language description, linguistic data constitute the basic
vocabulary, meaning the collection of lexical items, that needs to appear along-
side a descriptive grammar based on the very same data, that is to say, a set
of formal rules as to how those elements should be organized into larger and
logical units.
5 See,forinstance, Kitābii,34;iii,555;iv,197.AsdescribedbyCarter“Noteveryitemwasaccep-
ted merely because it came from a Bedouin Arab: now and then Sībawayhi actually points out
errors in speech, calling one particular usage ‘very bad’ (radīʾ jiddan), and referring to one set
of incorrect speakers as ʾahl al-jafāʾ ‘coarse people’.” (Carter 2004:40).
6 lisān ʿarabī mubīn, Q. 16/103; 26/195.
7 The topic is widely addressed by Arabic scholars themselves. Cf. for instance the Muqaddima
by Ibn Ḫaldūn (d. 808/1406), who discusses the fact that the distortion in language may be
traced in the interaction of native speakers of Arabic and those who acquired Arabic as a
consequence of their inclusion in the Islamic empire (cf. Ibn Ḫaldūn Muqaddima iii, 343).

In the case of the Arabic tradition, this vocabulary holds a particularly signi-
ficant legacy, due to the nature of the elements it is composed of. The Qurʾān,
the pre-Islamic poetry, and the data gathered from the Bedouins’ varieties do
playasubstantialrolebecauseof theirculturalsignificance,andthedescriptive
aimstrivenforbygrammariansprovidesgroundsforandsuppliesthematerials
with which the grammatical arrangement operates.
As we have discussed above, a major portion of the founding vocabulary
for linguistic theorizations on Arabic grammar comes from the “speakers with
an innate knowledge of grammar”, as Zaǧǧāǧī (d. 337/949) refers to Bedouins
(ʾĪḍāḥ66). Their speech was a fundamental building block to record and make
available through linguistic collections, and the availability of informants’ data
in the earliest grammatical as well as lexicographical treatises is significant
because they are meant to portray the linguistic reality of the 1st/7th century.
The fact that these data would be made available in the Kitāb contributes to
the establishment of the role of this work across the tradition. In fact, a notice-
able point in the contents and structures of—especially later—grammatical
treatises is that they seem to find foundations in the Kitāb and in the data dis-
cussed therein. The Kitāb was in fact not only the authoritative source, but also
a container of information, and gained such a significant status that it finally
became a corpus in itself. Its data were clearly not only pieces of evidence for
linguistic arguments to be utilized once, but an actual collection to be trans-
mitted.
A major issue in the process of transmission of data in the linguistic tra-
dition pertains to the shortage of first-hand data. Sībawayhi had inquired the
Bedouins directly and had thus the opportunity to collect some expressions
that he could well deploy for linguistic arguments. But even in the cases in
which he would not have data collected by himself, he could still rely on data
collected by other reliable scholars, first and foremost Ḫalīl. His master is in
fact mentioned several times with respect to data collection, and included in
the anecdotes in which we are told that they had “asked the Arabs and found
that they agree”.8
Arabs, as well as their speech, played such a central role because informants
of the Arabic varieties at issue mastered the language, and were thus trusted
because of their natural instinct toward the appropriateness of speech. Such a
role is praised rather decidedly in grammarians’ works, for it is presented as the
manifest evidence for the correctness of an argument. Bedouins would thus be
inquired by Sībawayhi and other scholars, all driven by the ambition to collect
8 E.g., wa-saʾalnā al-ʿarab fa-waǧadnāhum yuwafiqūnahu (Kitāb iii, 390).

information and translate into words their innate sense of linguistic correct-
ness. The “fieldwork”, if we may use this term to refer to the kind of linguistic
investigation carried out by grammarians, is introduced in grammatical texts
alongside statements that avoid suspicion, and hint at the unquestionable reli-
ability of the data deployed.We thus find expressions such as “we heard it from
whom whose Arabic can be trusted”, and several other variations on the theme
that set forth the grammarians’ judgment on the substantiality of the data.9
Grammarianswerealsoconfrontedwiththesometimes-attestedlackof pro-
ficiencyof someArabs.Inthecaseof Sībawayhi,hewouldwelldepreciatesome
of their expressions. Analogous circumstances are recounted much later by Ibn
Ǧinnī (d. 392/1002) who discusses (Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 5) the linguistic errors made by
Bedouins who seem to be unable to speak proper Arabic, which would affect
the linguistic research based on a preliminary description of discrete data.
Despite the narration in the Ḫaṣāʾiṣ, an interesting point in Ibn Ǧinnī’s
approach to teaching is that data collection would still be a central element
in linguistic investigation. For first-hand data description was then so funda-
mental,IbnǦinnīwouldstillencouragehisstudentstocheckonlinguisticfacts
by inquiring Bedouin informants to formulate linguistic analyses.The question
finally remains on how disciples, and grammarians themselves, would relate to
data knowing that these would not be representative of the pure Arabic they
strove for.
Shortage in (or perhaps also lack of) availability of first-hand data directly
collected from innate grammarians gives then a further explanation to the fact
that the earliest collections would be transmitted as a whole corpus, alongside
their status of reference texts. If data could no longer be collected, and pro-
fessional grammarians together with their disciples were inevitably confronted
withtheissueof languagechange,datareliabilityfromothersourceswasfinally
the way forward. Sībawayhi’s corpus of data, partly also based on Ḫalīl’s col-
lection as we have mentioned above, is hence of major importance for many
factors. On the one hand, it is representative of several attestations of the lan-
guage,asthegrammarianwouldcollectvariantsfromdifferentvarietiesandlist

data included in the Kitāb as well as in the earliest grammatical treatises were
to become an inventory of linguistic information, a memoir of the Arabic lin-
guistic identity.
9 The declination of the expression mostly follows the same patterns in all anecdotes, with
formulations such as samiʿnāhu mi-man yūṯaqu bi-ʿarabiyyatihi, yūṯaqu bi-ʿarabiyyatihi min
al-ʿarab, or that even point at specific groups of informants: wa-samiʿnā baʿḍman yūṯaqu bi-
ʿarabiyyatihim yaqūlu.

Furthermore, Sībawayhi laid the foundations of a hierarchy of variants and
varieties, by discussing the appropriateness of the speech construction. For
instance, even though the elements at the basis of the pursued fuṣḥā10 were
mostly from the Tamīmī variety, he would still praise the high-level of the
Ḥiǧāzī speech11 (Kitāb iv, 473) defined as al-luġa al-ʿarabiyya al-qadīma al-
ǧayyida (“the good old Arabic language”). Conversely, there are instances in
which Sībawayhi returns a severe judgment on certain expressions, labeled as
‘bad’ or only ‘partly appropriate’. We thus find in the Kitāb expressions such
as wa-hāḏihi luġa radīʾa (Kitāb ii, 34), wa-ʾammā ʾahl al-luġa al-radīʾa (Kitāb
iv, 197), wa-ḏālika qalīl radīʾ (Kitāb iii, 555) that provide us with Sībawayhi’s
appraisal of the data presented but that also surely served later grammarians
in further selecting them.
Finally, the collection and consequent systematization of the data, as far as
their status of reliability is concerned, is of twofold importance for the upcom-
ing traditions. On the one hand, the shortage of first-hand data did play a
substantial role in approaching the sources, and data collected directly were
at some point inevitably supplanted by referred data. Scholars who were not
able—for whatever reason—to collect data themselves, clearly relied on the
established sources (or excerpts of these) on which there was already a schol-
arly agreement, enough for making their use legitimate. It is thus the scholarly
transmission that provided the data their legitimacy and validity to be used for
linguistic theorizations.
On the other hand, we should also consider that sometimes linguistic argu-
ments are not supported by data at all, for grammarians would discuss hypo-
thetical structures that could not get a match or be grounded in the corpus
at their disposal. Finally, many of the examples used for describing a certain
argument were often made up and designed for that specific purpose and had
no direct relation with the corpus. This would be the case, for instance, of the
number of examples containing the words zayd, ʿamr, ḍaraba, qāʾim, and all
possible shuffled options with these and other wild card words.
This being the case, linguistic description eventually turned into theoriza-
tions grounded in a closed corpus.12 Legitimacy on linguistic arguments thus

The term fuṣḥā does not appear in Sībawayhi’s Kitāb. Nevertheless, as described by
Larcher, “Tous les arabisants savent que l’expression d’al-lugha al-fuṣḥâ désigne la variété
d’arabe qu’ils appellent eux-mêmes «arabe classique»” (Larcher 2008a:263). Thus, that
being the case, we have opted for using the term regardless of its absence in the Kitāb.
As the matter would surely need to be discussed at much length, which unfortunately we
cannot properly do here, cf. on this Larcher 2008a.

resulted from a common agreement among scholars, and the reliability of the
conclusions was accepted as long as these were framed within a consistent lin-
guistic theorization based on the ʾuṣūl al-naḥw, the foundations of grammar.
3.2
Author’s Significance
The reliability of the Kitāb is undisputed across the grammatical schools, and
its significance was evidently not only a matter of data collected. By laying
the foundations of the discipline, Sībawayhi’s became beyond doubt the most
prominent figure of the tradition. His influence was also not only limited to the
Basran grammatical school that developed out of his teaching,13 but was well
established all throughout the Arabic linguistic tradition.
The internal conflict among the professional grammarians was sparked off
by the question of authority.14 They had learned from the logicians that rules
depend for their validity on the data from which they are inductively derived
and that only a closed corpus could guarantee that these rules could never be
overturned by new data. The controversy, which would result into the Basran
(closed corpus)/Kufan (open corpus) division, was long and acrimonious; nev-
ertheless,grammariansneverlostsightof thefactthatthegrammaticalscience
must draw its authority objectively from its logical structure and not, as had
formerly been the case, subjectively from the personal prestige and strength of
character of its leading practitioners.
Notwithstanding, no other grammarians, whatever the school, ever pro-
posed a completely different approach from Sībawayhi’s. Despite some differ-
ences in the formulation and slightly dissimilar features, the general remarks,
as well as the more specific elucidations provided by Sībawayhi on the lin-
guistic structure of the fuṣḥā, are traceable in any later theorization. Just as
an example, no other Arabic scholar ever proposed an alternative theory for
the parts of speech (ʾaqsām al-kalām), up to modern times almost undisputed
in its original formulation: fa-l-kalim ism wa-fiʿl wa-ḥarf (Kitāb i, 1)15 Only in
ing still is the difference in attitude to data. The traditional Arab grammarians, after an
initial and relatively short phase of truly descriptive grammar, were left with a corpus of
data which was no longer the product of direct observation but had acquired the nature
of legal evidence whose authenticity was guaranteed by the reliability of its transmitters.
This material legitimized a self-consciously prescriptive grammar whose purpose was to
perpetuate an ideal form of Arabic for reasons that are well known” (Carter 1987/1988:213).

There have been some further propositions but none of them accomplished the task of
reformulating this completely or went as far as proposing a new theory.

a few cases the need for a more specific classification is registered, namely in
Suyūṭī (d. 911/1505; ʾAšbāh iii, 2) who mentions the fourth category ḫālifa,16 and
in Fārābī (d. 350/961), who proposes the category ḫawālif among others. But
regardless of the propositions, the only fully accepted formulation is the one
proposed in the Kitāb and all further assertions are based on this.
The respect paid to Sībawayhi’s figure entails a certain adherence to his pro-
positions also when it comes to providing linguistic arguments. In the gram-
matical schools’ tradition and the ḫilāfāt tradition as well,17 Sībawayhi’s state-
ments are often used both when providing argumentations and when con-
futing other grammarians’ theories. As Carter put it: “the history of Arabic
grammar is the history of what happened to the Kitāb” (Carter 2004: 138), thus
pointing at the undisputed significance and impact of the Kitāb all across the
Arabic linguistic tradition.
Arabic grammarians would acknowledge the relevance of Sībawayhi’s pro-
positionsasearlyasinthe3rd/9thcentury.WethusfindclaimssuchasMāzinī’s
(d. 249/863) who argues that anyone who aimed at writing a large book on
grammar after the Kitāb should be ashamed (man ʾarāda ʾan yaʿmala kitāban
kabīran fī al-naḥw baʿd Sībawayhi fa-l-yastaḥyi).18
The prestige attributed to Sībawayhi, as in the case of data reliability dis-
cussed in the previous section, comes from a scholarly agreement and trans-
mission. By the end of the 3rd/9th century, and thanks to the credit bestowed
byal-ʾAḫfašal-ʾAwsaṭ(d.215/830),Māzinī,andMubarrad(d.285/898),the Kitāb
had reached the status of founding text of Arabic grammar.
The importance of the figure is evident also in that, when presenting their
data, grammarians would claim their consistency with Sībawayhi’s theories as
much as they would do with the kalām al-ʿarab or other substantial sources.
The respect is paid through fixed formulas widely deployed in literature:
What demonstrates the correctness of what we have affirmed is that
Sībawayhi himself confirms it, by saying that […]. (wa-llaḏī yadullu ʿalā
ṣiḥḥati mā ḏahabnā ʾilayhi ʾanna sībawayhi yusāʿidunā ʿalā ʾanna […]);
16
Further information on the category ḫālifa can be resumed by the studies of ʾAḥmad
Makkī al-ʾAnṣārī (notably ʾAnṣārī 1964) who investigates Farrāʾ’s (d. 207/822) role in the
Arabic linguistic tradition as the leading figure of the grammatical school of Kufa. The
author states that Farrāʾ was the first who investigated and proposed a fourth lexical cat-
egory between the noun and the verb.
17
Ḫilāfāt refers to the tradition of grammatical works such as the Tabyīn of ʿUkbarī (d. 616/
1219)orthe Kitābal-ʾInṣāf byIbnal-ʾAnbārī(d.577/1181),structuredastopresentthediffer-
ent opinions adduced by grammarians and grammatical schools for each linguistic issue

125
What demonstrates the correctness of what we have affirmed is that a sim-
ilar expression exists in the variety of the Arabs (wa-llaḏī yadullu ʿalā ṣiḥḥat mā
ḏahabnā ʾilayhi lahu naẓīr fī kalām al-ʿarab).19
What can be immediately inferred by the examples above, and that is self-
evident considering the congruence in phrasing, is the perception of coincid-
ence between the two elements, the Kitāb, and the kalām al-ʿarab. Thus, the
comparative relation of the two sources illustrates how, in linguistic literat-
ure, Sībawayhi’s conclusions represent a source as authoritative as Bedouins’
speech.
However, the Kitāb was never easy to approach and was certainly thorny to
interpret. Its complexity, even obscurity at times, are acknowledged in many
instances. For example, in the Ṭabaqāt by Zubaydī (d. 379/989) we are told
of Ibn Kaysān (d. 299/911 or 320/932), a Basran disciple of Ṯaʿlab (d. 291/904)
and Mubarrad (cf. Ṭabaqāt 153) who did not read the Kitāb to Mabramān
(d.326/938).Inadditiontothis,wearealsotoldof IbnKaysānrelyingonZaǧǧāǧ
(d. 311/923) for the transmission on the text (cf. Ṭabaqāt 153).
One of the reasons that would explain Ibn Kaysān’s approach to the text,
which is not dissimilar from other authors’, is perhaps the major difficulties
with which scholars were confronted when endeavoring to interpret the text.
The Kitāb is in fact acknowledged as the hardest Arabic grammar to read,20
and Sībawayhi’s arguing style is often far from being clear. This eventually led,
on the one hand, to the production of many works that aimed at further clarify-
ing his propositions, and, on the other hand, to the rise of a new literary genre,
more pedagogical,21 that could be more easily approached by disciples.
The tendency of reading the Kitāb through the lens of the scholars who
devoted their works to further explaining Sībawayhi’s Kitāb is consistent up
to modern times, since even modern translations of the text—like the one by
Jahn (1895–1900)—are not so much a translation but rather re-interpretation
of Sībawayhi through the medium of Sīrāfī (d. 368/979), his major comment-
ator (cf. Sīrāfī Šarḥ).
19
Such formulas are widely used in e.g., the Kitāb al-ʾInṣāf.
20
For instance, we are told by Mubarrad that the Kitāb was as hard as “how to ride the sea”
(Carter 2004:133).

The Legacy of the Kitāb22
Major issue in the kind of mosaic portrayed so far is the lack of transparency
when it comes to distinguishing the distinctiveness of the text itself from inter-
pretations set forth by later grammarians and commentators.
The problem is twofold: on the one hand, the issue of pinpointing what is
distinctiveof the Kitābissubstantialinthatfurtherelucidationsof similarmat-
ters may have returned results far from their original formulation; on the other
hand, there is an issue that arises from re-interpretations that may have been
intentionally diverging from the original message.
The first aspect mentioned regards the transmission of the text. As we have
already discussed above, the Kitāb was never easy to approach, and coeval as
well as later traditions were confronted with such difficulties. Grammarians
then put an effort in elucidating it, producing many works that would serve
the purpose of making Sībawayhi’s theorizations more widely available.
Thesecondissue,instead,concernsinterpretationsof thetextthatmayhave
been somewhat altered. Of this second aspect, we will briefly mention a few
illustrative instances in the next sections.
4.1
Examples of Ambiguous Reference
Aswehaveseeninthepreviousparagraphs,Sībawayhiclearlyrepresentsawell-
grounded authority and recipient of an across-the-board acknowledgment by
all branches of the Arabic linguistic tradition. Hence, excerpts from the Kitāb
are widely found in other Arabic grammarians’ arguments.
It is thus clear that arguments finding justification in one substantial source,
i.e. the kalām al-ʿarab, the Qurʾān, the ḥadīṯ-s, as well as authoritative sources
like the Kitāb, are provided with an indisputable legitimacy that is hard to chal-
lenge. As far as the Kitāb is concerned, what may happen is that not only actual
references are mentioned, but also arguments that are either inferred from a
more general viewpoint or only ascribed to Sībawayhi, without providing an
exact reference. But given the importance of the actor, claiming a direct attri-
bution of a statement seemed to be enough for purporting the same consensus
one would gain with an exact phrasing or reference.
In many instances, finally, Sībawayhi’s words might have been misinter-
preted. Whether this was intentionally done or simply an issue of transmission
or interpretation, it is not known. Nevertheless, we do find few references to

referencing sībawayhi: the reception of the kitāb as a source
127
Sībawayhi’s theorizations that were referred to or re-proposed in a formulation
distant from their original version.
One case of misinterpretation is reported for instance by Marogy (2010:
151ff.) who, addressing the issue of the structure of ʾinna, aims to demonstrate:
That Sībawayhi’s discussion of ʾinna’s operation has been misinterpreted.
By analogy with the operation of ʿišrūna ‘twenty’ on dirhaman, ʾinna’s
operation consists of assigning the dependent form to the mubtadaʾ ‘sub-
ject/topic’ while leaving the ḫabar independent, i.e. unaffected by ʾinna’s
operation.
marogy 2010: 152
Another example is presented in Kasher (2015) who discusses the identity of
the operator of the independent mood of the verb. One remark provided by
Kasher is the discussion on how earlier writers:
Do not ascribe this view to Ṯaʿlab, but rather state that Ṯaʿlab misinter-
preted Sībawayhi as if the latter had regarded this resemblance as the
operatorassigningtheindependentmoodtotheverb[…].Thelatergram-
marians’ ascription of this view to Ṯaʿlab might thus be due to their mis-
interpretation of earlier sources.
kasher 2015: 124, fn. 21
Kasher provides then a possible source for Ṯaʿlab’s misinterpretation, referring
to the Muqtaḍab (iv, 84) by Mubarrad, “where the text reads: fa-hāḏihi l-ʾafʿālu
marfūʿatun li-muḍāraʿatihā l-ʾasmāʾa wa-wuqūʿihā mawāqiʿahā… (cf. ibid. iv,
80–81)” (Kasher 2015: 124), and thus suggesting a reading of where the misin-
terpretation might have stemmed from.
4.1.1
Haǧar
Ambiguous references are also found23 in the case of haǧar.The case is presen-
ted in the Kitāb in the chapter on the ʾasmāʾ al-ʾarāḍī (Kitāb iii, 242–246) (‘city
names’),inwhichSībawayhiaddressesthematteraboutthetreatmentof haǧar
as either masculine or feminine (wa-kaḏālika haǧar yuʾannāṯu wa-yuḏakkaru,

The two cases reported here, about haǧar and laysa, are presented also in Baalbaki
(2008:233–235). With regard to the former, cf. also Baalbaki 1999.

Sībawayhi’s argument is based on the discussion on two quotes; one is from
Farazdaq (d. 114/732?):
qāla al-farazdaq: minhunna ʾayyām ṣidq qad ʿuriftu bihā ʾayyām fāris wa-l-
ʾayyām min haǧarā.
Kitāb iii, 243
and the other is the proverb:
wa-samiʿnā man yaqūlu ka-ǧalibi al-tamr ʾilā haǧar yā fatā.
Kitāb iii, 244
These same examples have later been reused for addressing diverse matters.
Thus, both the quote of Farazdaq and the proverb have been presented in
the same formulation to discuss the treatment of haǧar concerning a differ-
ent aspect. What we find in following traditions is in fact a wider discussion
revolving around the treatment of the term as either diptotic or triptotic, an
aspect not discussed by Sībawayhi. The argument, though, is triggered by the
same elements as presented in the Kitāb, regarding the data reported therein,
and with distinct mentions to Sībawayhi, who—as we mentioned above—
never discussed the matter from this perspective.
In its further formulation, the discussion on the subject parts: on the one
hand, grammarians consider haǧar diptotic; on the other hand, lexicographers
treat haǧar as a triptotic noun.
Needless to say, legitimacy is claimed by both sides, also by directly quoting
Sībawayhi as a supporting argument: in the grammatical tradition, we find Zaǧ-
ǧāǧī who reports the quote from Farazdaq, as per it is presented in the Kitāb,
and associates haǧar and its morphological features with those of the ʾasmāʾ
al-mudun (Ǧumal 231).
In the lexicographical tradition, instead, we find Ibn Sīda (d. 458/1066) quot-
ing Sībawayhi and the proverb wa-samiʿnā man yaqūlu ka-ǧalibi al-tamr ʾilā
haǧar yā fatā (Muḥkam iv, 159). In this latter case, the lexicographer argues
for a triptotic declension of haǧar due to the presence of yā fatā at the end.
The placement of yā fatā as a closing element of the sentence would in fact
be a device to force an ending on the preceding word, preventing it from tak-
ing on a pausal form; if haǧar were triptotic, yā fatā could not be used for the
sentence, that instead would have to end with a noun carrying a tanwīn.

4.1.2
Laysa
Another case of ambiguous reference, again concerning the way Sībawayhi’s
position is reported, regards laysa and the position of its ḫabar (comment).
The cornerstone of the discussion is the anticipation of its predicate, within a
structure like the following:
comment–kāna/its sisters–topic
The wider discussion on this kind of construction is generally rather controver-
sial in grammatical literature and includes several opposing arguments on its
admissibility.
The case we want to address here refers specifically to laysa. The discussion
ispresentedwiththemade-upexpressionqāʾimanlaysazaydun,withtheḫabar
of laysa preceding laysa and its noun following it.
Among the grammarians who allow the comment–laysa–topic construc-
tion at issue, we find the grammatical school of Basra, Suyūṭī, Zamaḫšarī
(d. 538/1144), and Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī (d. 456/1064); on the other hand, those
who do not allow such formulation belong to the grammatical school of Kufa,
Mubarrad, Ǧurǧānī (d. 471/1078), Zaǧǧāǧ, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, and Sīrāfī.24
To briefly recall two of the arguments from both sides, we here mention al-
Suyūṭī’s proposition in which he assimilates laysa with kāna, conferring it the
same characteristics of its bigger sister. Hence, since kāna may be placed after
its ḫabar, the same should hold true for laysa. The assertion is thus based on
the wider characteristics of the whole group (kāna and its sisters), as confron-
ted with the group of ʿasā, which is weaker than the former, and for which a
selfsame construction should not be allowed (Hamʿ i, 373).
Such construction is also reported in Ibn al-Nāẓim’s (d. 686/1287) Šarḥ
(p. 135) in which the author claims that additional support to such thesis is
provided by Sībawayhi’s acceptance of similar constructions, e.g., ʾa-zaydan
lasta miṯlahu.
Conversely, a major weakness in this argument is alleged by Ǧurǧānī who
claims that being laysa weaker than kāna—that is fully declinable—it should
not be assigned those characteristics belonging to kāna only, because of its full
conjugation (Muqtaṣid i, 408–409).
Nevertheless,themostinterestingpointisǦurǧānī’sargumentregardingthe
fact that, despite the diverse claims of his contestants, Sībawayhi never really

Conclusion
In this paper, the role of Sībawayhi and his Kitāb as a source for Arabic gram-
marians’ theorizations was presented.
Starting with the data contained in the Kitāb and the reasons why these
became so fundamental, we discussed Sībawayhi’s role in the Arabic linguistic
tradition. The main objective of this paper was to provide an overview of the
role played by Sībawayhi’s figure in the development of the linguistic sciences
by discussing the way his work was received by coeval and later traditions as
well as what impact it had on them.
What comes from this outline is the picture of a particular source, whose
legacy remains uttermost relevant throughout the Arabic linguistic tradition,
conceptually connected to Sībawayhi to a noticeable extent and all across its
branches.
The reasons why the Kitāb played such a significant role and had a huge
impact on Arabic scholars are various. As we have discussed in this paper,

most due to the credit bestowed on him by grammarians even from opposed

tion and study of the text, with a noticeable impact on the traditions to come.
The circulation of the Kitāb ensured the circulation of the data contained
therein as well; data which later provided for a major issue for the coming
generations of scholars, who were confronted with the shortage of first-hand
data.
Thus,if thefigureof theauthorwerenotrelevantenough,thissecondaspect
would surely contribute to the substantiation of the Kitāb as a corpus. It was
not only Sībawayhi’s arguments that circulated, but they came along the data
he had collected, which later served as a core corpus for the traditions to come.
AsCarterasserted,“bythetenthcenturylaysafīkalāmal-ʿarabwasvirtuallythe
same as laysa fī Kitāb Sībawayhi” (Carter 1999: 64): the relevance of the source
was by that time well established, and its reliability for both reasoning and data
was incontrovertible.
Hence,consideringtherelevanceof thefigure,Sībawayhi’swords—whether
attested or inferred—evidently provided legitimacy to linguistic arguments,
whatever the line of thoughts of the scholar at issue. The Kitāb had, in fact,
such a noticeable impact all across the Arabic linguistic tradition that it shortly
became a reference work for all grammarians. Consequently, claims in this dir-
ection, namely the claim to be in line with Sībawayhi’s view on a certain matter,
somehow would prevent scholars from being challenged by their contestants,
as would happen by proving consistency with other fundamental sources.

The Kitāb was, in conclusion, a substantial source for the coming genera-
tions of Arabic scholars, who could not but relate to the founder of the lin-
guisticdisciplines,despitethewidelyacknowledgeddifficultiesinapproaching
Sībawayhi’s work:
Theeverrichpotentialforcontroversyandinterpretationwhichthe Kitāb
offers makes it by far the most inspiring treatise in the Arabic linguistic
tradition, if one chooses not to mention several other fields of Arabic
studies.

Grammar and the radd Genre in al-Andalus
Francesco Binaghi
Introduction
Written refutations, in both forms of short epistles and longer treatises, have
represented common scholarly productions in the Islamicate world since its
earliest times. Typically known under the title of Kitāb (al-Radd) ʿalā…, these
compilations were particularly abundant in all fields of profane and religious
literature between the 2nd/8th and the 4th/10th centuries, when they might
have contributed to the development of the different sciences.The importance
of these works can easily be attested by the number of such titles included in
Ibn al-Nadīm’s (d. 385/995) Fihrist.1
This trend can also be observed in the field of language studies. As far as
Arabic grammar is concerned, two very well-known refutations are al-Radd
ʿalā Sībawayhi by Mubarrad (d. 285/898) and al-Radd ʿalā al-Mubarrad, also
known as al-Intiṣārli-Sībawayhi, by IbnWallād (d. 332/944). Similar works were
also ascribed to other important grammarians like Ḫalīl (d. 175/791?), Farrāʾ
(d. 207/822), Ṯaʿlab (d. 291/904) and Ibn Ḫālawayhi (d. 370/980). After this
period, however, the importance of such compilations seems to have faded,
since a significantly smaller number of Radd-s were attributed to later gram-
marians. As a matter of fact, an inclination for the intellectual debate certainly
lived through to later authors (personal attacks and scholarly criticisms can
for instance be found in bigger commentaries and compendia), but biobibli-
ographical dictionaries recorded a small number of such titles, which entails
that autonomous refutations were deemed to be less important for the intel-
lectual life of their period.
Once more, the situation appeared to be different in the Western periphery
of the Islamicate world, namely al-Andalus, where many aspects of the intel-
lectual life tended to be characterized by archaic features that had meanwhile
disappeared or evolved in the heart of the Islamicate world.2
1 Cf. Ibn al-Nadīm Fihrist index, 109–111. Cf. also ei2, art. “Radd” (D. Gimaret).
2 In the field of grammar, this is exemplified by the dominant role played by earlier treatises—
notably, but not exclusively, Sībawayhi’s (d. 180/796?) Kitāb, Zaǧǧāǧī’s (d. 337/949) Ǧumal
and Fārisī’s (d. 377/987) ʾĪḍāḥ—in the development of grammatical studies at least until the
7th/13th century (cf. Binaghi 2015: notably 6–18).

Grammatical Radd-s in al-Andalus
In the studies on the history of the Arabic grammatical tradition, one of the
most cited references is undoubtedly the “Refutation of the grammarians”,
Kitāb al-Radd ʿalā al-nuḥāt, by the Andalusi Ibn Maḍāʾ (d. 592/1196). Even
though its author was a Ẓāhirī jurist, who became qāḍī al-quḍāt under the
Almohades, and its core message should be taken as coming from a religious
polemist,notagrammarianstrictlyspeaking,thistreatisedirectlytackledsome
of the grammarians’ pillars, such as the theory of ʿamal (case and mood alloca-
tion, hence linkedtoʾiʿrāb)andgrammaticaljustifications(ʿilal),onwhich they
had built their theory. Therefore, it must be taken as a contribution interven-
ing in the field of grammatical discussions, and its anticonformist and revolu-
tionary approach has attracted the attention of many authors and researchers
especially in the last century.
However extreme Ibn Maḍāʾ’s work was in its conceptual stance, it is far
from being the only case of grammatical radd in al-Andalus; quite on the con-
trary, it could be seen as a prototypical example of an Andalusi inclination
towards intellectual debate and polemics. Biobibliographical sources record
a great number of radd works composed by Andalusi authors (some 71 titles
according to ba: b, 305–306),3 a good amount of which discussed grammatical
matters. Unfortunately, just a few of all the works related to linguistic issues
have been transmitted up until today, therefore it is not always easy to clearly
define the specific topic in which lost refutations intervened. For the purpose
of this research, I have only retained those radd-s dealing—certainly or most
likely—with the grammatical theory.4 The criteria adopted for the selection of
works are as follows: (a) an explicit mention, in the title, of a grammatical treat-
ise or issue; (b) indirect reference of their content in other sources, especially
biobibliographical dictionaries; (c) the author and the target of the refutation
are both grammarians, or one of them has expressed views related to language
3 This figure only includes treatises whose title starts with Radd, therefore it does not encom-
pass other refutations bearing original titles or starting with a different word.
4 Some refutations were addressing issues of language use and “applied grammar”, such as
al-Radd ʿalā al-ʾaʾimma fī-mā yaqaʿu fī al-ṣalāt min al-ḫaṭaʾ wa-l-laḥn fī šahr ramaḍān wa-
ġayrihi by Makkī b. ʾAbī Ṭālib (d. 437/1045), rather than dealing with the grammatical theory
in broader terms.
I have not considered as refutations the treatises presenting a systematic analysis of
another text (matn), e.g. the al-Ḥulal fī ʾiṣlāḥal-ḫalal al-wāqiʿ fī al-Ǧumal by Ibn al-Sīd al-
Baṭalyawsī or the Risālatal-ʾIfṣāḥbi-baʿḍmāǧāʾaminal-ḫaṭaʾfīal-ʾĪḍāḥby Ibn al-Ṭarāwa: even
though some of them can prove quite critical, as discussed below, I would rather categorize
them as commentaries because they provide a chapter-by-chapter discussion of the matn.

This “refutation against Ibn Sirāǧ through a unique epistle” is mentioned by Kalāʿī
(fl. 6th/12th century; ʾIḥkām 68), who also provides us with information on its topic. The
debate between Ibn Sirāǧ (d. 489/1096) and al-ʾAʿlam al-Šantamarī originated in this lat-
ter’s al-Masʾala al-rašīdiyya, and more precisely in his etymological and morphological
analysis of the name Allāh. Such an analysis, mixing divine and profane elements, drew
Ibn Sirāǧ’s severe theology-based criticism—even though we ignore under which form
and in which context this was expressed: was it an autonomous radd compilation as
well?—, to which al-ʾAʿlam al-Šantamarī responded with a risāla farīda. This latter’s refut-
ation must have been conveyed in an independent, written pamphlet.
6
Ibn Ḫayr (d. 575/1179; Fahrasa 515, no. 1228) mentions this epistle, as well as “Ibn Ḫalāṣa’s
[sic] answer” (cf. radd no. 4), among the works he had studied. It is to be noted that Ibn al-
Sīdal-Baṭalyawsī’snameisdirectlyfollowedbythetitleal-naḥwī (thegrammarian),which
must point to the fact that these debates concerned grammatical issues.
7
According to Bannā (1980:50–51), this controversy between Ibn al-Ṭarāwa and Ibn al-Bāḏiš
(d. 528/1133) concerned the particle ʾillā in exceptive constructions.
8
According to Ibn al-ʾAbbār (d. 658/1260; Takmila ii, 134), this risāla recorded the debates
between Ibn al-Ǧazzār and Ibn Ḫalaṣa on several issues relating to the grammatical ana-
lysis (ʾiʿrāb) of Qurʾānic verses.
9
This is the title under which the text was published and by which it is commonly referred
to today. However, Wolfe (1984:27–39 and 1990) argues that this text is actually the result
of the merger of two different works on grammar that Ibn Maḍāʾ had originally written,
Tanzīh al-Qurʾān ʿammā lā yalīqu bi-l-bayān (to which the preamble and sections one, five
and six of the published Radd would belong) and al-Mušriq fī al-naḥw (for the remaining
sections two, three and four).
10
We have no information about the content of this refutation. However, given that Ibn
Ḫarūf was a renowned grammarian in al-Andalus, the author of grammatical commentar-
ies and many radd-s against other grammarians (cf. below), and that Ibn Ḥazm’s (d. 456/
1064) thought reveals many connections with linguistic concepts and ideas (cf. for in-

this refutation might also have dealt with some kind of grammatical or language-related
issue. Also, in the list of Ibn Ḫarūf’s radd-s given by Ibn ʿAbd al-Malik (d. 703/1303; Ḏayl v,
320), this title is immediately preceded and immediately followed by other titles clearly
dealingwithgrammar(refutationsagainstIbnal-Ṭarāwaandal-ʾAʿlamal-Šantamarībefore
it, and against Ibn Malkūn after it), which means that probably this author considered it
to be a grammatical radd as well.
11
Another refutation of al-ʾAʿlam al-Šantamarī’s al-Masʾala al-rašīdiyya (cf. radd no. 2).
12
Ibn al-ʾAbbār (Takmila iii, 383) informs us that this radd against Ibn Malkūn (d. 581/1185 or
584/1188) was about “the Arabic language” ( fī al-ʿarabiyya), probably meaning grammar.
13
This refutation is also included by Ibn al-ʾAbbār (Takmila iii, 383) among those dealing
with “the Arabic language” ( fī al-ʿarabiyya), i.e. likely grammar.
14
Ḫwānsārī (d. 1313/1895; Rawḍāt v, 246), who provides this title (previous biobibliograph-
ical sources had only mentioned a Radd ʿalā Ibn Maḍāʾ, adding however that it concerned
linguistic matters; cf. for instance Ibn al-ʾAbbār Takmila iii, 383), also informs us that this
refutation targeted Ibn Maḍāʾ’s Tanzīh al-Qurʾān ʿammā lā yalīqu bi-l-bayān. Ibn Ḫarūf’s
title attests an evident polemical attitude towards it.
15
We have no concrete information about the content of this radd. However, two elements
drive us to believe that it might be included in this list: the fact that Ibn Rušd (d. 595/1198)
wasalsotheauthorof agrammaticaltreatise,al-Ḍarūrīfīṣināʿatal-naḥw(cf.Hamzé2002);
andthefactthatIbnʿAbdal-Malik(Ḏaylv,320)mentionsitafterthe RaddʿalāIbnMalkūn,
and before the two refutations against Suhaylī (d. 581/1185) and Ibn Maḍāʾ, all of which
dealt with grammatical issues.
16
Ruʿaynī (d. 666/1268; Barnāmaǧ 82) informs us that Ibn Ḫarūf and Rundī had some dis-
agreements on different issues relating to the Arabic language (munāqaḍāt fī masāʾil min
al-ʿarabiyya, i.e. grammar). We deduce that probably, following Ibn Ḫarūf’s refutation
against Suhaylī (cf. radd no. 11), Rundī intervened to defend his teacher (cf. radd no. 16),
so Ibn Ḫarūf also addressed a counter-refutation to this latter.
17
This refutation was also known in some sources as al-Radd ʿalā al-Zamaḫšarī fī Mufaṣṣa-
lihi.

A quick look at the list enables us to remark that almost all of the refutations
simply bear a generic, descriptive title including the name of the author and/or
the title of the treatise which constitute the target. Only four refutations (no. 13,
17, 23 and 24) have a proper, specific title, even though two of them (no. 13 and
17) are also known in some sources with the more generic al-Radd ʿalā.
A more interesting clue for a typological analysis of radd writing in al-
Andalus could be underlying in the opposition between the terms radd and
18
The title suggests a summary of the dispute that opposed Ibn Wallād to Mubarrad, which
was related to Sībawayhi’s heritage and played a central role in the textual history of
the Kitāb. We cannot exclude that Ibn al-Ḥāǧǧ intervened himself in these debates and
expressed his own criticisms. According to ba (iii, 331), a manuscript dated as of 623 H
(= 1226ce)wouldhavebeenpreservedintheMaktabaʾAḥmadiyya(Tunis)underno.3966.
The manuscripts of the Maktaba ʾAḥmadiyya have now been integrated in the collection
of theNationalLibraryof Tunisia,andmanuscriptshavebeenrecataloguedwithnewcode
numbers. During my research at the National Library of Tunisia in August–September
2013, I was unable to find this text.
19
Probably another refutation of al-Muqaddimāt ʾilā ʿilm al-Kitāb (cf. radd no. 10).
20
The target of this refutation must have been the Risālat al-ʾIfṣāḥbi-baʿḍmā ǧāʾa min al-
ḫaṭaʾ fī al-ʾĪḍāḥ(cf. Ibn al-Faḫḫār al-ʾArkušī al-Ǧuḏāmī’s Iḫtiṣār al-intiṣār li-kitāb al-ʾĪḍāḥ
min risālat al-ʾIfṣāḥ, no. 24).

Ibn al-Sīd al-Baṭalyawsī is the author of two (complementary) commentaries on Zaǧǧāǧī’s
Ǧumal:al-Ḥulalfīʾiṣlāḥal-ḫalalal-wāqiʿfīal-Ǧumalongrammar,andal-Ḥulalfīšarḥʾabyāt
al-Ǧumal on its poetic quotes. This refutation must have targeted the former.
22
Mentioned by Maqqarī (d. 1041/1632; Nafḥiv, 148) within a rather long list of authors
who criticized (intaqada) Ibn ʿUṣfūr’s (d. 669/1271) treatise al-Muqarrib fī al-naḥw, along-
side Ibn al-Ḍāʾiʿ’s Radd (cf. no. 22) and others written by learned men from the Maghrib
(e.g. al-Minhaǧ al-muʿarrib fī al-radd ʿalā al-Muqarrib by ʾAbū ʾIsḥāq ʾIbrāhīm b. ʾAḥmad b.
Muḥammad al-Ǧazarī al-Ḫazraǧī al-ʾAnṣārī al-Maġribī, d. 709/1309).
23
It was presumably an abridged version of the Radd by Ibn al-Ḍāʾiʿ, who had been his
teacher.

risāla that appear in the titles, as they might have been used for two different
forms of refutation.The term risāla seems to have been used for writings either
outlining the debates between two contemporary grammarians (no. 5 and 6),
or expressing the author’s views in a dispute opposing him to a peer (no. 2 and
3). Treatises called radd, on the contrary, seem to identify works targeting a
specific treatise (no. 1, 9, 10, 13, 17 and 22) or an earlier grammarian, this latter
being identified in either an explicit way (no. 8, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, 20 and 21) or in
more general and anonymous terms (no. 7 and 25).Three exceptions should be
accounted for, nevertheless, in such a typological division: Ibn Ḫalaṣa’s answer
toIbnal-Sīdal-Baṭalyawsī(no.4)and,onecenturylater,Rundī’sresponsetoIbn
Ḫarūf and Ibn Ḫarūf’s subsequent answer to Rundī (respectively no. 16 and 15).
A possible, partial explanation of these exceptions—I would hypothesize—
lies in a more archaic use of the term risāla to identify grammatical debates
between contemporary authors. Both the term and the practice might have
been abandoned around the mid-6th/12th century, when data shows that a
greater number of refutations of earlier grammarians and grammatical treat-
ises started to be composed, in parallel with the decline of epistolary disputes.
As grammatical radd writing spanned over three centuries and a half in al-
Andalus, from the end of the 4th/10th century to the first half of the 8th/14th
century, two common characteristics can be found in all of these titles: (1) they
were written works, some of which even studied and transmitted as any other
literary or scientific text;24 and (2) they were compiled as autonomous works.
We can likely identify this production as pertaining to a specific literary genre,
related to but at the same time independent from a more general and common
attitude towards intellectual debate, which was expressed either in oral form25
or within other treatises as an argumentative tool for theoretical elaboration.
Regrettably, only one out of the twenty-five titles listed previously has been
preserved and is presently available to us: the aforementioned Kitāb al-Radd
ʿalā al-nuḥāt by Ibn Maḍāʾ.26 Apart from this work, which has already been
studied extensively,27 it is therefore impossible to analyze the content of the
Andalusi grammatical radd-s in order to better define their extension, the

authors’ methodology and the impact that they might have had on the gram-
matical theory. Nonetheless, the analysis of their title could be very enriching
for a better understanding of the kind of relations linking some of the most
important figures in the field of Andalusi Arabic grammar, and more generally
of the scholarly networks in which they evolved.

Among the peculiar features of this production—as I have already pointed
out—is also the fact that the titles usually include the name of the grammarian
who is the target of the refutation and, sometimes, the title of the specific work
that is refuted.28 This data has been gathered in the following table:29

grammar and the radd genre in al-andalus
143
Table 6.1 shows even more clearly that three grammarians (Ibn Ḫarūf, Ibn al-
Ḍāʾiʿ and Ibn al-Faḫḫār al-ʾArkušī al-Ǧuḏāmī) composed more than half of the
titles of the list. Their polemical disposition might be explained as an idiosyn-
cratic feature, especially in the case of Ibn Ḫarūf, whose contribution amounts
to no less than eight refutations. Nevertheless, it might also be a sign of the
evolution of the Andalusi grammarians’ interest for this genre. Whereas in
the Islamicate world as a whole radd-s had been particularly abundant in the
earlier period, namely between the 2nd/8th and the 4th/10th centuries, this
practice seems to have developed later—at least among grammarians—in al-
Andalus: among the fourteen different authors, five lived in(to) the 6th/12th
century (five titles out of twenty-five), and seven in(to) the 7th/13th and early
8th/14th centuries (eighteen titles).
More important, table 6.1 highlights the geographical “endogamy” of such
debates. Only a few treatises (no. 1, 17 and 18, at least explicitly) targeted
grammarians or treatises from outside al-Andalus. This does not necessarily
mean that the evolution of the grammatical theory in this area was com-
pletely independent of the contemporary contribution of Eastern grammari-
ans. However, this does imply that Andalusi grammarians perceived them-
selves as an autonomous community. They did not oppose their Eastern col-
leagues altogether as a single block, which suggests that they did not perceive
their identity as being shaped exclusively by an East-West opposition. They
mainly targeted grammarians within their geographical and cultural environ-
ment in an effort tocompetefor intellectualsupremacy,thereforeprovingtheir
in fine total independence in scholarly debates vis-à-vis Eastern grammarians.
The identification of the grammarians involved in this process, both as
authors and as targets, proves useful for the analysis of Andalusi scholarly net-
works, since some figures occur more than once and so they enable us to look
for some regular patterns. In figure 6.1 below, I have reorganized the elements
emerging from the Radd-s and then cross-referenced them with data avail-
able on master-pupil teaching relations. A division between two groups can
be drawn.
Such a reconstruction certainly has its limits, notably because some gram-
marians only appear once in the corpus and, at the same time, the significant
number of refutations written by Ibn Ḫarūf and Ibn al-Ḍāʾiʿ has driven me to
place all of their targets in the opposite column. Had the texts of the Radd-s
Ibn Wallād lahu) suggests that Ibn al-Ḥāǧǧ al-ʾAzdī was rather leaning towards Ibn Wal-
lād’s position, even though we unfortunately have no elements to confirm it.

been preserved, they might have revealed a more nuanced picture, especially
with regard to the scope of the criticism and the extent of the opposition.
However, master-pupil relations support this pattern considerably, since they
allow us to identify some regularities. Foremost, it confirms the importance of
direct scholarly ties in shaping intellectual legacies and loyalties, which take
the form of either a pupil defending his master (Ibn al-Ǧazzār defending Ibn
al-Sīd al-Baṭalyawsī following Ibn Ḫalaṣa’s refutation; Rundī endorsing Suhaylī
against Ibn Ḫarūf’s attack), or a pupil targeting the same author/treatise as
his master (Ibn al-Ḍāʾiʿ and Ibn al-Faḫḫār al-ʾArkušī al-Ǧuḏāmī both refuting

Ibn al-Ṭarāwa’s Risālat al-ʾIfṣāḥ). At the same time, a long, uninterrupted, dir-
ect teaching line starting from al-ʾAʿlam al-Šantamarī, passing through Ibn al-
Ṭarāwa and Suhaylī, and arriving at Ibn Maḍāʾ, Rundī and Ibn Maʿzūz could
strengthen the architecture of such a sketch. Clearly, we should not minimize
the (sometimes strong) differences between these authors, nor underestim-
ate the imprint other teachers (even from other disciplines) might have left.
Notably so in a region characterized by a high number of scholars and of learn-
ing centers, where studying with several learned men and—at least as much
as the political situation allowed it—in different cities was rather the norm
until later periods. We should not think either, more generally speaking, that
all of the grammarians in the left column of figure 6.1 subscribed to the same
theoretical framework. Nevertheless, despite all of this, it is still worth ques-
tioning whether authors in each one of the two groups share any common
features.
3
Of Sources and Epistemology
The most criticized author in our list is Ibn al-Ṭarāwa: he will thus be the start-
ing point of our inquiry. The main books he wrote on grammar were both
equally criticized by some Andalusi grammarians: al-Muqaddimāt ʾilā ʿilm al-
Kitāb wa-šarḥal-muškilāt ʿalā tawālī al-ʾabwāb (targeted by Ibn Ḫarūf and Ibn
al-Ḍāʾiʿ) and Risālat al-ʾIfṣāḥbi-baʿḍmā ǧāʾa min al-ḫaṭaʾ fī al-ʾĪḍāḥ(refuted
by Ibn al-Ḍāʾiʿ and Ibn al-Faḫḫār al-ʾArkušī al-Ǧuḏāmī). These two treatises
reveal Ibn al-Ṭarāwa’s conception of what grammar should be: a prelude to
the study of Sībawayhi’s Kitāb. Such a conception is revealed not exclusively
through the title of the first work (al-Muqaddimāt ʾilā ʿilm al-Kitāb), but also
in the introduction to the second one, when he alludes to “transmitted com-
pendia” (al-muḫtaṣarāt al-marwiyya) as “authoritative treatises” (al-tawālīf al-
musnada, Ibn al-Ṭarāwa ʾIfṣāḥ16), and later identifies such “authoritative treat-
ises” with Zaǧǧāǧī’s Ǧumal, Naḥḥās’ Kāfī and finally Sībawayhi’s Kitāb (Ibn
al-Ṭarāwa ʾIfṣāḥ35).32 Ibn al-Ṭarāwa clearly exhibits his preference for these
works, and all throughout the Risālat al-ʾIfṣāḥhe criticizes Fārisī’s ʾĪḍāḥ. The
oppositionbetweentheǦumalandtheʾĪḍāḥreflectstheirdivergenttaxonomic
organization and, in fine, their theoretical framework: Fārisī’s volume presents
a highly systematized theory that reorganizes Sībawayhi’s material in a rational

way; Zaǧǧāǧī’s compendium, on the contrary, has no particular theoretical pre-
tension33 and simply presents the grammatical material in a pragmatic way
whichparticularlysuitsthebeginner.34ItisnosurprisethatZaǧǧāǧī’sapproach
would particularly suit Ibn al-Ṭarāwa’s conception and needs.
Itisthiscriticismof Fārisī’sʾĪḍāḥthatsparkedreactionsandrefutationsfrom
other grammarians. His contemporary Ibn al-Bāḏiš was the first one to overtly
attackIbnal-Ṭarāwa’sstance(Bannā1980:18),butlatergrammariansIbnḪarūf,
Ibn al-Ḍāʾiʿ and Ibn al-Faḫḫār al-ʾArkušī al-Ǧuḏāmī also intervened to endorse
Fārisī’s work (all of these grammarians are in the right column in figure 6.1).
Regrettably, the only treatises at our disposal among those composed by these
authors are Ibn Ḫarūf’s commentaries on the Kitāb and on the Ǧumal, thus we
have little proof to definitely confirm their predilection for Fārisī over Zaǧǧāǧī.
However, Ibn Ḫarūf provides us with some interesting comments in the intro-
duction to his Šarḥal-Ǧumal:
He [i.e. Zaǧǧāǧī] compiled it [i.e. the Kitāb al-Ǧumal] for the begin-
ners, but depended on the teachers to elucidate it, and he aimed at con-
ciseness like the Bedouins used to do with metonymical and figurative
expressions; working with this is a loss of time in more than one respect.
(ʾiḏwaḍaʿahu li-l-mubtadiʾīn wa-ttakala fī bayānihi ʿalā al-muʿallimīn wa-
qaṣada al-ʾīǧāz ʿalā maḏhab al-ʿarab fī al-ittisāʿ wa-l-maǧāz fa-l-ištiġāl bi-
ḏālika taḍyīʿ li-l-zamān fī ġayr šaʾn, Ibn Ḫarūf Šarḥal-Ǧumal i, 243).
Here, the pronoun “this” (ḏālika) could refer to either the Ǧumal or its con-
ciseness (ʾīǧāz): in both readings, however, the final sentence sounds like a
negative assessment. We infer that Ibn Ḫarūf was unsatisfied with Zaǧǧāǧī’s
treatise,whichheconsideredgloballyinadequatebothasahandbookforgram-
mar teaching (it requires teachers to elucidate it) and for its approach to the
grammatical theory (its conciseness with the use of metonymical and figurat-
ive expressions).
On the other side, Ibn al-Ṭarāwa’s positive opinion about Zaǧǧāǧī’s Ǧumal
was also shared by Ibn al-Sīd al-Baṭalyawsī. In the introduction to his al-Ḥulal
fī ʾiṣlāḥal-ḫalal al-wāqiʿ fī al-Ǧumal, he states:
33
Despite that, some principles of its taxonomic organization—notably the primacy of the
verbalsentenceoverthenominalsentence,andhence thecentralityof theverband of the
theory of ʿamal—would be retained by most Andalusi grammarians and would become a

Despite pointing to some imperfections, which Ibn al-Sīd al-Baṭalyawsī attrib-
utes to an excessive abridgement and condensation of the grammatical matter
(ʾafraṭafīal-ʾīǧāzwa-l-iḫtiṣār),heneverthelessrecognizesitscentralroleforthe
discipline and its importance as a propaedeutical introductory text.
Ibn al-Sīd al-Baṭalyawsī and Ibn al-Ṭarāwa actually diverge in the devel-
opment of their grammatical analysis, as the latter keeps a more textualist
stance, whereas the former betrays a deep influence of philosophy. Yet, they
share their appreciation for Zaǧǧāǧī’s Ǧumal and the idea that grammar should
be considered as an introductory discipline, where the value of a text lies
not in its intrinsic qualities, but rather in its propaedeutical potential. These
elements are also shared by other grammarians listed in the left column of
figure 6.1.
From the point of view of intertextual relations, sources indirectly link Ibn
ʿUṣfūr’s Muqarrib to Zaǧǧāǧī’s Ǧumal. Ibn al-Zubayr (d. 708/1308) reports a
common opinion that all of the Muqarrib’s definitions had been taken from
Ǧazūlī’s (d. 607/1211) al-Muqaddima al-ǧazūliyya.35 As for this latter treatise,
all of the sources, starting from Qifṭī (d. 646/1248), underline the fact that its
origin lay in a series of glosses on Zaǧǧāǧī’s Ǧumal written by Ǧazūlī himself
while studying this text in Egypt with the grammarian Ibn Barrī (d. 582/1187),
glosses which were subsequently re-elaborated to serve as the basis of the text
of the Muqaddimaǧazūliyya(QifṭīʾInbāhii,378).Eventhoughthegrammatical
theory had evolved between Zaǧǧāǧī and Ibn ʿUṣfūr, and this latter distanced

legacy. Ibn ʿUṣfūr’s Muqarrib was targeted by two refutations, notably by Ibn
al-Ḍāʾiʿ who had also refuted Ibn al-Ṭarāwa’s works.
Following Ibn al-Ṭarāwa’s textualist stance, other grammarians seemed to
oppose the predominance of formal considerations and excessive theorization
overbasicprinciplesandcommonsense.Itisfirstof allthecaseof Suhaylī,who
“advances views which imply that the theory [of ʿamal] should be amended
in ways which would reveal the importance of maʿnā as an essential criterion
in interpreting usage” (Baalbaki 2008: 290, and following pages for the ana-
lysis of Suhaylī’s views). His opposition against arbitrariness and unnecessarily
far-fetched theoretical explanations is also revealed in his treatment of the
question of mamnūʿ min al-ṣarf, especially with regard to proper names. While
the mainstream theory saw such proper names as the exception (ʾiʿrāb being
the central principle of Arabic grammar) that needed to be explained through
a complex system of underlying traits, Suhaylī considered that it was proper
names taking tanwīn that represented the deviation from common sense. In
his view, proper and common nouns represent two different classes (hence not
sharing the same grammatical requirements), and proper names behaving as
common nouns (i.e. taking ʾiʿrāb) could simply be explained as having their
origin in the latter’s class.36
FurtherdownthiswaywentIbnMaḍāʾ,who—aswehavealreadymentioned
—wanted to abolish the method developed by Arab grammarians by challen-
ging some of their central notions: he postulated the priority of samāʿ (oral
attestation) over qiyās (analogical reasoning); he argued against secondary and
tertiary justifications (ʿilal), which he deemed to be far too speculative and
abstract; he asserted the insanity of the theory of ʿamal (and of its subsidiary
principle of taqdīr), as it contradicted the Ẓāhirī principle that Allāh is the only
true “governor” in this world. However, Ibn Maḍāʾ wanted to preserve almost all
of the normative content of grammar, and from this viewpoint—despite the
considerable differences that I have just mentioned37—he seemed to link with
Ibn al-Ṭarāwa’s conception of grammar as an introductory, propaedeutical dis-
cipline for the study of “sacred” texts: the Qurʾān and other religious texts in
the case of Ibn Maḍāʾ; Kitāb Sībawayhi, the qurʾān al-naḥw, in the case of Ibn
al-Ṭarāwa.
36
For an in-depth study of mamnūʿ min al-ṣarf in the Arabic grammatical tradition, and
more details on Suhaylī’s criticism of the mainstream theory, cf. Druel & Kasher 2019.
37
Baalbaki (2008:279), however, also points out that “[b]y frequently referring to the
speaker’s intention (cf. his use of yanwī and yurīd), Ibn Maḍāʾ is in broad agreement with
authors who do take meaning into consideration in their syntactical analysis”, as it was
the case with Suhaylī.

grammar and the radd genre in al-andalus

Conclusions
As the genre of radd in al-Andalus will always be identified with today’s fam-
ous Kitāb al-Radd ʿalā al-nuḥāt by Ibn Maḍāʾ, it actually accounted for a rather
abundant production that attests to Andalusi grammarians’ intellectual activ-
ity and polemical disposition.38 This article aimed at collecting, systemizing
and presenting this production in order to enlarge our knowledge of the Arabic
grammatical tradition that flourished in al-Andalus. As no other treatise than
Ibn Maḍāʾ’s seems to have been preserved, preventing us from a direct invest-
igation into their content, the analysis had to be based on the scarce inform-
ation provided directly by their title or by other sources, and on the theories
that the grammarians involved in these debates had exposed in other treat-
ises. As a result, the conclusions could only be of a speculative and somehow
impressionistic nature given the fragmented data available, especially on some
grammarians.
After a presentation of the corpus, the relations between the grammari-
ans involved in the debates have been schematized, also taking into account
the broader intellectual networks and master-pupil ties (figure 6.1). The result
presents a general division into two groups, whose coherence and pertinence
have subsequently been evaluated.
Two elements seem to characterize each one of the two groups. The first
one is the source which represents the most prestigious reference (in addition
to Sībawayhi’s Kitāb) in their theory. Most authors (those in the left column of
figure 6.1) considered Zaǧǧāǧī’s Ǧumal to be the most prestigious and appropri-
ate handbook for the study of grammar (e.g. Ibn al-Sīd al-Baṭalyawsī and Ibn
al-Ṭarāwa); or they linked up with it in the genesis of their treatises (e.g. Ibn
ʿUṣfūr and his Muqarrib) and in the basic principles adopted for the elabora-
tion of their theory: Suhaylī’s and Ibn Maḍāʾ’s proposals for a simplification of
thegeneraltheoryandforawiderapplicationof commonsenseingrammatical
analysis could reflect the Ǧumal’s taxonomy, devoid of any speculative theor-
ization and based, on the contrary, on pragmatic considerations. On the other
side of the divide, Ibn al-Bāḏiš, Ibn Ḫarūf, Ibn al-Ḍāʾiʿ and Ibn al-Faḫḫār al-
ʾArkušī al-Ǧuḏāmī (right column in figure 6.1) seemed to lean in favor of Fārisī’s
ʾĪḍāḥ, defending this treatise notably from the criticisms of Ibn al-Ṭarāwa. Ibn
38
An anonymous reviewer has drawn my attention to the fact that the West Mediterranean
witnessed many polemics also among grammarians of Hebrew. An evaluation of whether
there was a common denominator for such a fertile ground for polemical writing among
both Arabic and Hebrew grammarians would deserve further research.

Ḫarūf’s very sharp judgements on the Ǧumal, in the introduction to his Šarḥ
Ǧumal al-Zaǧǧāǧī, point to this same direction.
This battle for legitimacy and predominance among two of the most import-
ant sources for grammatical studies in al-Andalus—the third one being Sība-
wayhi’s Kitāb—probably underlies an epistemological opposition with regard
to the purpose of grammar. Authors adopting Zaǧǧāǧī’s Ǧumal as the main ref-
erence seem to consider grammar as an instrumental, auxiliary science for the
study of founding texts of the Arabo-Islamic civilization, be it the Qurʾān and
other religious texts (Ibn Maḍāʾ), or the first and foremost treatise of the Arabic
grammatical tradition, Sībawayhi’s Kitāb, the qurʾān al-naḥw (Ibn al-Ṭarāwa).
Taking into consideration the Ǧumal’s internal structure and the particular
sociolinguisticsituationof al-Andalus,wemightinferthattheirprimaryobject-
ive was language teaching and pedagogical efficacy. The authors preaching for
the superiority of Fārisī’s ʾĪḍāḥ, on the contrary, might have been more inter-
ested in the rational construction, systematization and general coherence of
the theory; in other terms, they would have been more prone to perceive gram-
mar as a speculative science. I argue that this opposition is of an epistemolo-
gicalnaturebecausetheconceptionof grammareitherasaninstrumental/aux-
iliary or as a speculative science clearly has an influence on the grammarians’
theoretical approach to grammatical knowledge: Suhaylī’s stance on the role of
maʿnā, for instance, challenges one of the basic methods of grammatical ana-
lysis (i.e. ʿamal), while Ibn Maḍāʾ’s radical opposition to several principles of
the grammatical theory builds up as a clear disagreement about the scope of
this science, as he also tries to reassess the distinction between justified belief
(i.e. grammatical rules) and unjustified opinion (i.e. grammatical argumenta-
tion). In view of the fact that the study of the ʾĪḍāḥin al-Andalus started at a
later period if compared to the Ǧumal’s,39 we might suppose an Eastern (i.e.
from the mašriq) influence on such a development.
An important remark, however: what I tried to define as the primary pur-
pose for grammar would not have prevented authors from developing their
analysis in different directions, so we should not consider the two groups as
constituting monolithic entities. When we look at the first group of gram-
marians, for instance, we could immediately notice at least three different
approaches:grammariansmovedbycommonsenseandtextualconsiderations
(Ibn al-Ṭarāwa and Suhaylī); grammarians more influenced by philosophical
39
The first commentary on the Ǧumal was compiled by Ibn al-ʿArīf in the second half of the
4th/10th century, i.e. roughly half a century after Zaǧǧāǧī’s death. In comparison, the first
commentary on Fārisī’s treatise, the Ṭurar ʿalā al-ʾĪḍāḥby Ibn al-ʾAḫḍar (d. 514/1120), only
saw the light of day more than a century later.

questioningandprinciples(Ibnal-Sīdal-BaṭalyawsīandIbnRušd);andauthors
abiding by religious tenets and inflecting their linguistic thinking accordingly
(Ibn Ḥazm and Ibn Maḍāʾ).
Finally, we should query whether these fraction lines, in addition to the
aforementioned questions of sources and epistemology, also developed along-
side the evolution of the textual history of Sībawayhi’s Kitāb: thanks to Hum-
bert (1995), we know that Fārisī and Zaǧǧāǧ (d. 311/923)—Zaǧǧāǧī’s main
teacher, from whom he took his šuhra—were key figures in the establishment
of, respectively, the Eastern and the Western recensions of the Kitāb. Was the
interest for any of the two books (the ʾĪḍāḥand the Ǧumal) possibly linked to
the history of these two recensions? Further research might provide us with an
answer.40

Fārābī against the Grammarians??
Wilfrid Hodges and Manuela E.B. Giolfo
Introduction*
The two present authors have a joint project to compare the views of Sīrāfī
(d. 368/979) and Ibn Sīnā (d. 427/1037) on language, and in particular on the
role of meaning and its interaction with syntax. They contributed some of this
work toTheFoundationsof ArabicLinguistics iii, iv (cf. Giolfo and Hodges 2018,
2019). For conference v in this series, Amal Marogy invited the contributors to
“focus on the challenges to the Kitāb’s status during the formative and medi-
eval periods of Arabic grammatical activities”. Neither Sīrāfī nor Ibn Sīnā can
be regarded as posing a challenge to the status of the Kitāb, and so we decided
to break away from our joint project and look elsewhere.
Since one of us has recently been closely involved with the linguistic and
logical views of Fārābī (d. 339/950), we wondered if he could be regarded as
posing a challenge to Sībawayhi (d. 180/796?). There are hints that he could.
For example Cornelia Schöck (2006: 427) describes Fārābī as holding views on
language which were “in direct confrontation to the Arab grammarians”. Also
Kees Versteegh (2000: 304) comments that
(1)
[Fārābī’s] open admission of a lacuna in Arabic compared to all other lan-
guages is quite unusual in Arabic writings; it would certainly be unthink-
able in a grammatical treatise.
Fritz Zimmermann (1981: cxxxv) illustrates Fārābī’s attitude to Arabic gram-
mar as follows:
(2)
If the Greek grammarians say that there are five cases of the noun, then
our world must be such that for something to be a noun is to have five
cases, even if the Arabic noun has no more than three and the Syriac does
not inflect at all.

The writing of this paper was hindered by a spell in hospital for one of the authors follow-
ing a stroke. We warmly thank Manuel Sartori and Francesco Binaghi for their support and
patience under these difficult circumstances.

Could Fārābī be considered as a kind of accidental radd author? We will
argue No, in three steps.
First we will examine the evidence for Fārābī’s relationships with the lin-
guists among his contemporaries, and we will find them to be entirely cordial
and productive.
Secondly we will extract from his writings a description of grammar as he
sees it. His description is complementary to that of the Arabic linguists, in the
followingsense.Heisconcernedtodescribelanguageingeneral,theneedsthat
create language, and the extent to which Arabic meets these needs; while the
Arabic linguists take the Arabic language as a fact and aim to give an accurate
and evidence-based account of its structures.
Thirdly we will ask whether Versteegh, Zimmermann and Schöck have
uncovered any conflict between Fārābī’s grammar and that of the linguists.
Versteegh’s remark quoted above is correct but it reflects the complementary
relation between the grammatical theories, not a conflict. Zimmermann has
briefly allowed a vivid imagination to get the better of him. Schöck has raised
questions about early Islamic theologians and their relationship to notions
from Aristotle (d. 322bc). These questions deserve to be studied, but Schöck
herself fails to engage in a meaningful way with the basic notions of either logic
or linguistics.

Fārābī Himself
Fārābī lived from ca. 870 to ca. 950ce. He was fluent in Arabic and can be pre-
sumed to have known some Persian, not necessarily fluent. He also mentions
Greek, Syriac and Sogdian (an Indo-Iranian language of the Silk Road). But it’s
clear he didn’t know Greek. There is no good evidence that he knew Syriac or
Sogdian either, since his brief references to them are mainly lexicographic. He
never mentions Turkic languages. His origins are unknown, but his interest in
Sogdian might be a clue to them.1
He spent most of his life in Baghdad. He reports (quoted in ʾUṣaybiʿa’s
[d. 668/1270] ʿUyūn 604–606) that he was a student of the Syrian Yūḥannā
b. Ḥaylān. In the context of his report, the implication is that Yūḥannā intro-
duced him to the Aristotelian part of the syllabus of the old Neoplatonic School
1 For general information on Fārābī, see Druart 2019. Zimmermann (1981:xlviif) discusses
evidence of his lack of knowledge of several languages. Note 9 below illustrates why it is hard
to believe he could read Greek.

in Alexandria (5th–6th ca.), translated via Syriac from the Greek originals. Fār-
ābīdevotedtherestof hislifetoexpoundingthismaterialinArabic,withadded
commentary of his own, for the benefit of educated readers of Arabic.
His teaching on language is mainly scattered between four books. First, his
Catalogue of the Sciences (ʾIḥṣāʾ) begins at pages 45.1 to 52.1 with a section on
‘the science of language’ (ʿilm al-lisān). Then he describes the ‘art of logic’, and
a key ingredient of his description is an extended comparison of the art of logic
to the ‘art of grammar’ (ṣināʿat al-naḥw) at 54 l. 2–63 l. 12. Secondly his Ḥurūf
has various comments on language, including a theory of how languages came
tobecreated,thedevelopmentof technicaltermsinthesciences,andasensein
which the structure of language imitates the structure of concepts. Thirdly his
ŠarḥʿIbāra on Aristotle’s De Interpretatione tackles some particular questions
of grammar and semantics, mostly in relation to time and tense. The work also
repeatsthethemeof languageimitatingthestructureof concepts.Andfourthly
his book ʾAlfāẓintroduces the technical vocabulary of logic, with a number of
linguistic comments along the way.
A feature of Fārābī’s writing is that what he says about a topic varies with the
contextinwhich heisdiscussingit.2Asaresult,theaccountsof grammarinthe
fourworksjust mentionedarebynomeansvariantsof asingleaccount,though
in Section 3 below we will aim to find a single account that will accommodate
all four. In the case of ʾIḥṣāʾ we know that the variation depends partly on his
use of sources. His account of the science of logic there is based on an earlier
essay of the Neoplatonist scholar Paul the Persian (6th century ce), and thanks
to Miskawayhi’s (d. 421/1030) Tartīb (19 l. 13ff.) we have a more direct Arabic
translation of this essay.3 It will be important to note places where Fārābī says
something different from his Neoplatonist template.
Given that Fārābī used a template for his description of logic in ʾIḥṣāʾ, we
may wonder if he used another template for his description of language. A
recent paper of Vidro (2020) describes a genre of descriptions of Arabic gram-
mar which could have served this purpose; they report Arabic grammar using
notions from Greek grammar. Vidro considers one fragmentary example and
gives reasons for ascribing it to the translator Ḥunayn b. ʾIsḥāq (d. 260/873).4
2 Contrast Ibn Sīnā, who on any topic will give his current view. These current views tend to
change slowly through Ibn Sīnā’s career, preserving their main points.

The change from ‘language’ in pages 45 to 52 of ʾIḥṣāʾ to ‘grammar’ in pages 54
to 63 of ʾIḥṣāʾ probably reflects the terminology in Fārābī’s templates, since the
earlier section is hardly less grammatical than the later.5
Besides the four works ʾIḥṣāʾ, Ḥurūf, ŠarḥʿIbāra and ʾAlfāẓ, we can draw
information from Fārābī’s own linguistic practice, particularly where it brings
him alongside linguists of his time. One of these linguists was Ibn al-Sarrāǧ,
known to us chiefly for his ʾUṣūl; he died in 316/929. Another was Sīrāfī (cf. Pin-
gree 2002), from whom we have a detailed commentary (referred to below as
Šarḥ) on the Kitāb of Sībawayhi. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ is named as one of Sīrāfī’s teach-
ers in linguistics.6
2
Fārābī’s Relations with Grammarians
According to the historian Ibn ʾAbī ʾUṣaybiʿa:
(3)
History has it that Fārābī used to meet ʾAbū Bakr b. al-Sarrāǧ in order
to learn from him grammar and to teach him logic. (wa-fī al-tārīḫʾanna
al-fārābī kāna yaǧtamiʿu bi-ʾabī bakr b. al-sarrāǧ fa-yaqraʾu ʿalayhi ṣināʿat
al-naḥwwa-ibnal-sarrāǧyaqraʾuʿalayhiṣināʿatal-manṭiq,ʿUyūn606l.8f.)
Not everything that the medieval historians tell us about Fārābī is believable.
But Zimmermann on pages cxviii–cxx in the learned introduction to his
(1981) assembles some evidence in support of (3). The chief items are a state-
ment by Ibn al-Nadīm (d. 385/995) in his Fihrist that “Ibn al-Sarrāǧ had for a
time allowed himself to be distracted from grammar by the study of logic and
music” (Ibn al-Nadīm Fihrist 98 l. 14f.);7 and the fact that both Ibn al-Sarrāǧ and
Fārābī describe parts of speech using Peripatetic terminology.
tunity to study it fully.Vidro notes in particular that the paper under study agrees with Fārābī
at ʾIḥṣāʾ 48.10 in referring to the persons of a verb as wuǧūh, translating Greek prósōpa (cf.
Versteegh 1977:62 note 53).
5 Miskawayhi (Tartīb 51 l. 15; 54 l. 2) does talk of the ‘art of grammar’ (ṣināʿat al-naḥw).
6 Sīrāfī is also known for his public debate with Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 328/939) on Greek logic
versus Arabic linguistics, at the court of the vizier Ibn al-Furāt (d. 327/939) in 320/932.
Elamrani-Jamal (1983) translates into French the text of the debate on his pages 149–163, with
discussion on his pages 61–67. The absence of any mention of Fārābī in the report of this
debate suggests that even in his sixties Fārābī was still not widely recognized as the major
logician that we now know him to be.
7 Bear in mind Fārābī’s prowess as a musical theorist (cf. Druart 2020).

Zimmermann then observes that to prove the truth of Ibn ʾAbī ʾUṣaybiʿa’s
account it would be necessary
(4)
(a) to show that both men’s knowledge of the other’s subject was not
obtained from random sources, but from each other; and (b) to explain
why neither man ever seems to refer to the other, and why the biograph-
ical tradition is virtually mute on the subject of their connexion.
zimmermann 1981: cxx
We will return to (b) in Section 4.1 below. As to (a), we can certainly point
to more agreements between Fārābī’s terminology and that of Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
than Zimmermann mentions. The most likely explanation for these agree-
ments is that Fārābī adapted to logic some linguistic terminology that he
learnedfromIbnal-SarrāǧorfromSīrāfī.ChattiandHodges(2020)giveaslikely
examples fāʾida (Chatti and Hodges 2020: 92), istiṯnāʾ (56f.) and possibly ḍamīr
(35).
There is a pertinent passage in Sīrāfī’s Šarḥ:
(5)
Know that these verbs which make up this section […] give informa-
tion on the definite time or negation or transition or permanence. One
such is kāna, which has three meanings, of which the first is the one we
have [just] mentioned, as when you say ‘Zayd was knowledgeable’, where
the original [sentence] is ‘Zayd [is] knowledgeable’, and kāna is inserted
so as to indicate that that holds in time past. Similarly with ‘Zayd will
be leaving’. (ʾiʿlam ʾanna hāḏihi al-ʾafʿāla allatī ḍammanahā hāḏā l-bābu
ʾafʿāla […] wa-ḫabar fa-tufīdu fīhā zamānan muḥaṣṣalan ʾaw nafyan ʾaw

māḍin, wa-ka-ḏālika: “yakūnu zaydun munṭaliqan”, Sīrāfī’s Šarḥi, 296 l. 1–
4)
Sīrāfī’s argument here is remarkably similar to one that Fārābī adopts at Šarḥ
ʿIbāra (42 l. 1–18).
BothSīrāfīandFārābīareshowingthatthewordkānahasoneusageinwhich
itdoesnomorethanexpresspasttime.Theybothshowthisbyexhibitingasen-
tence about the past which is construed by adding kāna to a sentence that is
already complete although it does not contain reference to time past. Fārābī’s
example is the sentence zaydun kāna yamšī, which adds kāna to the complete
sentence zaydun yamšī.

Fārābī makes two further points. First, in this usage kāna is not a copula,
sincethesentence zaydunyamšī alreadyhasacopulain yamšī.(Thisfactwould
not have interested Sīrāfī, who makes no use of the logicians’ notion of cop-
ula.) And second, only Arabic needs a word expressing pure past tense, since
in “other languages” past tense is expressed by linking a particle (yuqranu bihā
ḥarfun, 42 l. 10f.) to the present-tense form. Hasnawi (1985: 31) rightly com-
ments on this “remarkable” application of linguistic tools simultaneously to
two languages with contrasting properties.8
So here we find the Peripatetic logician Fārābī in the role of linguist, while
the linguist Sīrāfī invokes Peripatetic terminology (muḥaṣṣal for ‘definite’).
Note that Sīrāfī, for whom this argument is on his home ground, gives his con-
clusion in a slightly more general form than Fārābī, by allowing the verb or par-
ticiple to be inflected when kāna is introduced. But the differences in approach
by the two authors are relatively minor; it is very easy to read the two forms of
theargument as reportsof thesameconversationbytwopeoplewhocomeatit
from different angles. If so then we are watching Fārābī doing serious business
with his younger contemporary.9
Chatti and Hodges (2020: 25f., 92) give several examples of innovations in
logical terminology that appear simultaneously in the treatises of Fārābī and
in translations from the Greek by ʾAbū ʿUṯmān al-Dimašqī (d. 302/914). The
most natural explanation is that al-Fārābī and Dimašqī quietly put their heads
together and made some joint decisions. Dimašqī was not a grammarian; he
was employed as a doctor, and he also translated several philosophical works
from Greek into Arabic. But this evidence of conversations between him and
Fārābī, though it is hardly decisive, tends to confirm the picture of Fārābī as a
scholar who was happy to discuss linguistic points with his contemporaries in
other fields.
8 But Fārābī is wrong here, even about classical Greek. Many of its past tenses are not formed
by linking a particle to present-tense forms. Thus present lambánō, aorist élabon, perfect
eîlēpha.AlsoHasnawimaynotberightinsuggestingthatthe“otherlanguage”isintroducedto
show that kāna expresses nothing but time; Sīrāfī’s form of the argument already shows that

A Language in the Abstract
3.1
What is in Our Minds before Language?
WewillfindwithinFārābī’sdescriptionsof grammarageneralaccountthatcan
serve as a framework for his various views of grammar. Happily the descrip-
tion in his Ḥurūf (134 l. 16–142 l. 4) seems written for just this purpose. Fārābī
believesthat languagefirstarisesincommunities.Soheimaginesacommunity
that has no language but is ripe to acquire a language. He asks what needs in
this community will cause it to create a language, and how these needs influ-
ence the form of the language.
Fārābībeginshisaccountbyexamininghowacommunityinthisinitialstate
comes to adopt an alphabet. But it soon becomes clear that he is making strong
assumptions about the community before it develops a language; we need to
draw out these assumptions. Thus he assumes the people in the community
are individually able to act and plan rationally, for example so as to acquire
skills, though without language (135 l. 14).They are also able to make each other
aware of their present basic needs, by pointing (ʾišāra, 135 l. 16), again without
language. The notion of things that are ‘pointable at’ (mušār ʾilayhi) is funda-
mental in Fārābī’s epistemology. Being pointable at makes a thing accessible
to our minds, and is the basic source of the concepts that Fārābī elsewhere in
Ḥurūf (64 l. 4; 65 l. 11) calls the “first intellecteds” or the “primary intellecteds”.10
Fārābī speaks of how the contents of our minds increase. Unfortunately it is
not always clear whether he is talking about what is available already before
language; some of his sources of new concepts may depend on our having
language. The one clear case is the concepts of the things that are pointable
at; these are available before language. Since you and I can point at the same
things, these concepts provide a starting-point shared by all members of the
same community. But Fārābī goes on to speak of processes that might require
language. For example meanings can be combined into compound meanings,
in a way that is ‘similar’ (šabīh, 140 l. 20) to the compounding of expressions
in a language. Another process is that we come to realize that our concepts
can be grouped, for example into those that are genera and those that are not
genera; this allows us to introduce the concept ‘genus’, which is not acquired
by pointing. Fārābī describes concepts acquired in this secondary way as ‘sec-
ondary intellecteds’ (64 l. 19). He emphasizes that the process can be iterated
10
By assuming that the community can communicate with each other by pointing, al-Fārābī
assumes that they already know how to mean or signify things and concepts. (He seems to
include both individual and universal concepts here; e.g. [Ḥurūf 137 l. 7].) So his account
of the origin of language sidesteps the question of the origin of semantics.

to infinity: ‘genus’, ‘genus of genera’, ‘genus of genera of genera’ etc. (65 l. 5) So
it seems that the concepts available to any of us even before language are a
potentially infinite collection, even if in practice language may be needed for
realizing the potential.
3.2
Communicating from One Mind to Another
Language begins when a member of the community forms a habit of using
a particular sound to represent a particular concept, instead of pointing to
instances of the concept, and other members of the community agree to adopt
this same habit (135 l. 17–136 l. 4). The people who first correlated a sound with
a concept are said to have ‘imposed’ it (waḍaʿa, 142 l. 2). The potential infinity
of concepts will cause a problem here, because in practice the number of dis-
tinguishable sounds that we can make is severely limited. But the community
will soon realize that this problem can be overcome by using finite successions
of sounds instead of single sounds (137 l. 36). The finite successions of sounds
accepted by the community form the expressions of the language of the com-
munity.
But it will be hopelessly inefficient for the community to rely on a fresh act
of imposition for each expression. We would like Fārābī to say at this point—
especially if we have read our Chomsky—that:
(6)
just as one can’t use newly-invented single words, so one can’t invent
constructions. […] The difference between grammar (naḥw) and lexico-
graphy is that grammar studies universal [rules], whereas lexicography
studies[words]oneatatime.Bothsciencescontributetotheconventions
[on which language is based]. ( fa-kamā lā yaǧūzu ʾiḥdāṯlafẓmufrad, ka-
ḏālika lā yaǧūzu fī al-tarākīb; […] wa-l-farq bayna ʿilm al-naḥw wa-ʿilm al-

quoted by Suyūṭī [d. 911/1505] Muzhīr i, 37 l. 15, 17f.)11
In short, the language needs to have impositions of grammatical rules as well
as impositions of single words. This is not in fact what Fārābī says, but ideas
like this take their time to emerge.
Instead Fārābī believes that he can capture what is needed by using the
notion of similarity (tašbīh, e.g. 139 l. 15). Briefly, the construction of the lan-

guage requires that if C1 and C2 are compound concepts constructed in similar
ways, then corresponding to them there are expressions E1 and E2 constructed
in similar ways. The similarity of E1 to E2 must itself be similar to the similarity
of C1 to C2.12
A version of this four-term relationship appears in the logic section of ʾIḥṣāʾ,
where it is often taken to be a characteristic view of Fārābī. But in fact Fārābī is
quoting Paul the Persian, with one significant addition. Paul had said:
(7)
the relationship of the art of grammar to the expressions is like the rela-
tionship of the art of logic to the meanings, and just as grammar guides
the language to correctness of speech and gives the rules by which one
knows inflection, so likewise logic guides the mind to correctness of
meanings and gives the rules by which one knows the facts. (ʾinna nis-
bat ṣināʿat al-naḥw ʾilā al-ʾalfāẓka-nisbat ṣināʿat al-manṭiq ʾilā al-maʿānī
wa-kamā ʾanna al-naḥw yusaddidu al-lisān naḥwa ṣawāb al-qawl wa-yuʿṭī

ḥaqāʾiq, Miskawayhi Tartīb 22 l. 5–8)
Take the grammar of a language as consisting of the rules for forming and using
grammaticalcompoundsinthelanguage,andlogicasconsistingof therulesfor
forming and using compound meanings. (This comes close to ʾAbū Ḥayyān’s
description of grammar in (6) above.) Then Paul is telling us that the gram-
matical compounds of expressions are analogous to the logical compounds of
meanings. Fārābī’s version is:
(8)
(this art [logic] is similar to the art of grammar: in fact) the relation of
the art of logic to the intellect and the concepts is like the relation of the
art of grammar to language and expressions. So for all the things that the
science of grammar tells us about the rules of expressions, the science
of logic gives us similar things (naẓaʾirahā) about concepts. (wa-hāḏihi
al-ṣināʿa tunāsibu ṣināʿat al-naḥw: ḏālika ʾanna nisbat ṣināʿat al-manṭiq
ʾilā al-ʿaql wa-l-maʿqūlāt ka-nisbat ṣināʿat al-naḥw ʾilā al-lisān wa-l-ʾalfāẓ.

al-manṭiq yuʿṭīnā naẓāʾirahā fī al-maʿqūlāt, Fārābī ʾIḥṣāʾ 54 l. 2–5)
12
So we have a proportionality: C1 is to C2 as E1 is to E2.

What Fārābī has added is that the analogy between grammatical and logical
constructions is itself a form of similarity.13
The purpose of this requirement of similarities is presumably to make the
class of impositions more internally coherent and less ad hoc, so that the lan-
guage is more easily understood and learned (cf. ʾIḥṣāʾ 147 l. 15–18). Fārābī
speaks of the system of similarity relations between concepts as an ‘organiz-
ation’ (intiẓām, 139.3), and he speaks of a language being a ‘copy’ (ḥikāya) (140
l. 12, cf. Šarḥʿibāra 50 l. 4, 13, 18, 23; 51 l. 2) of this organization. He believes that
the requirement applies also to single-word impositions: two similar simple
concepts should be represented by similar words (139 l. 2f.).
All of this is highly abstract, and Fārābī expounds it without giving concrete
examples of what he counts as a similarity. But we will find that Sībawayhi’s
Kitāb contains many examples that fit Fārābī’s formula.
3.3
Example of a Successful Language: Arabic
In Ḥurūf Fārābī comments that:
(9)
When meanings are similar in respect of an accident or a feature which
they share, they are rendered using expressions that are similar in shape
and similar in their ends and their beginnings, and each of these ends
or beginnings is taken as a single letter which is taken to signify the
accident. (wa-ʾiḏā kānat al-maʿānī mutašābihatan bi-ʿaraḍin ʾaw ḥālin mā
taštariku fīhā, ǧuʿilat al-ʿibāratu ʿanhā bi-ʾalfāẓin mutašābihati l-aškāli wa-

ʾawāʾiluhā ḥarfan wāḥidan fa-ǧuʿila dāllan ʿalā ḏālika al-ʿaraḍi, Ḥurūf 140
l. 3–6)
Here is one example out of many discussions in Sībawayhi that fit Fārābī’s
description. In Kitāb (ii, 263, §460) Sībawayhi mentions a number of words for
theplacewhereanactionoccurs:maḥbiswherepeopleareimprisoned,maḍrib
where a tent is pitched, maǧlis where people sit. These three expressions share
a feature of their meanings, and the words are similar in their beginnings; so
naturallywetaketheircommonbeginningma-tosignifythecommonmeaning
‘place where’. This is a well-known example which precisely fits Fārābī’s recipe
in (9).
13
One should not be surprised that Fārābī can express his similarity requirement in the
words of a sixth-century Neoplatonist.The seed for this collection of ideas about language
mirroring concepts is already planted in Plato’s (d. 348–347bc) Sophist (261d–263b).

Sībawayhi goes on to remark that since “time when” is similar to “place
where”, it can also be represented by this same form, as in mantiǧ “time of
giving birth”. A few pages later (Kitāb ii, 267, §465) Sībawayhi points out that
“what is done” and “where it is done” are analogous ideas, allowing them both
to be represented by the form mafʿūl (which illustrates Fārābī’s point about
both beginnings and ends). We will come back to these remarks of Sībawayhi
in Section 3.4 below, in the context of Fārābī’s claims about different kinds of
similarity, some more remote than others.
It seems that classical Greek has no straightforward equivalent to Arabic

he knew was true about Arabic? His reference in (9) to letters and the begin-
ning and ends of words does fit Arabic better than many languages. Again one
wishes he had given examples of what he had in mind.
When Fārābī describes the science of language in ʾIḥṣāʾ, he is no longer in
search of a general theory that fits all languages. At head (45 l. 1) and tail (52 l. 1)
of this section he does speak of a single “science of language”. But everywhere
between these phrases he talks of language “of some nation” (ʿinda ʾummatin
mā,45l.3,cf.46l.9f.;46l.17;47l.8)orsimply“thatlanguage”(ḏālikaal-lisān,47
l. 6; 47 l. 13; 49 l. 3f.; 51 l. 1), or sometimes specifically of Arabic (49 l. 6; 49 l. 10f.).
The section contains no comparisons between one language and another, or
any suggestion that a linguist might make such comparisons. The nearest he
comes to such a suggestion is at 47 l. 6, where he seems to imply that a lin-
guistic scientist studying a particular language might note that some feature is
peculiar to that language while another feature is universal across languages—
he gives no examples. In fact when he does state features that are peculiar to
some languages, they are always features of Arabic. Examples are the classi-
fication of nouns as masculine or feminine, with no mention of neuters as in
Greek (46 l. 15; 47 l. 16; 48 l. 10); the classification of verbs by number of letters
in the root, and whether the verb is geminate or defective (48 l. 7ff.); ʾalif lām
in Arabic (49 l. 6); the phenomenon of ʾidġām between words (51 l. 8). There is
no mention of features that are peculiar to Greek or Syriac or Turkish.

ence that Fārābī himself saw no conflict between his own philosophical view
of grammar and a standard introductory treatment of Arabic grammar.14
At Ḥurūf (146 l. 8–10) Fārābī conjectures that town-dwellers, being more
sophisticated than desert nomads, will find ways to make their vocal apparatus
more flexible, and hence are more liable to alter established pronunciations.
For this reason linguists will need to appeal to “people who live in houses made
of hair” (Ḥurūf 146 l. 5) to establish the true forms of words. This is clearly
an attempt at justification after the event for the Arabic linguists’ appeal to
Bedouins for authoritative forms.
This example shows Fārābī attempting justifications in general terms for
features of Arabic linguistics.There is no hint of any conflict between his gram-
matical theories and those of Sībawayhi and his successors. Rather Fārābī is
looking for explanations that could in principle apply to any languages, though
the phenomena that he seeks to explain here are Arabic phenomena that he
learned from the Arabic linguists.15
3.4
Example of an Unsuccessful Language: Arabic
Fārābī is also concerned that things can go wrong with a language, either
because it violates the requirements of similarity, or because it obeys them
in the wrong way. For example at Ḥurūf (141 l. 4–15) he worries that expres-
sions can be similar or dissimilar in various ways, and a language might follow a
“remote similarity” rather than a close one, giving rise to metaphors or ambigu-
ous words. He seems to suggest that these are bad outcomes, but he gives no
examplesof harmthatmightbedone.However,wecaneasilypickupexamples
of the phenomenon from the Arabic grammatical literature. Already in Section
4.2 we saw Sībawayhi discussing different kinds of similarity of meaning, and
how they create cross-cutting similarities of expressions.
Sīrāfī (Šarḥi, 443 l. 10–14, §17) records that grammarians have taken Sība-
wayhi to task for a wrong exposition of a line of the poet Sāʿida (d. 600? ce).
Sībawayhi supposes that the word kalīl must be an active participle (meaning
something like ‘being weak but frequent’) because of its formal similarity to
active participles such as raḥīm, ʿalīm, qadīr and samīʿ (Šarḥi, 440 l. 19). But in
fact the word is a noun for sheet lightning (which is weak but repetitious).

Fārābī’s description of Arabic in ʾIḥṣāʾ is almost neutral between different grammatical
factions.Theremarkat48l.5thatverbsarederivedfrommaṣdar-splacesitwiththegram-

in the eighth century.

fārābī against the grammarians??
169
Fārābī does give a concrete example where Arabic fails to supply a word to
fit a similarity. Arabic logicians use mawǧūd to mean ‘is’; but this usage violates
the requirements of similarity, because mawǧūd is a passive participle, hence
derived,whereastheconcept‘is’isnotderivedinthissense.InfactArabiccom-
pels this violation by not having a verb that means ‘is’ (Ḥurūf 110 l. 20–112 l. 3).
But why does Fārābī care? Has he any evidence of logicians being misled by
this violation? The simplest answer may well be the right one, namely that he
doesn’t care at all; the example is given purely to illustrate an abstract possib-
ility. This is confirmed by the fact that in spite of his interest in terminological
innovation (Ḥurūf 157 l. 5–161 l. 9), he takes no steps to repair any damage done
by this particular violation of similarity.16
Why does Fārābī single out Arabic as a language that falls foul of the sim-
ilarity requirement? Again the simplest answer may well be right: he chooses
an example in Arabic because there is no other language that he knows well
enough to find examples (see again our note 9). Versteegh’s phrase “all other
languages” in (1) above is revealing here: Fārābī repeatedly uses phrases mean-
ing exactly this.17 In no case does Fārābī draw a significant grammatical distinc-
tion between two languages that are not Arabic. Under these circumstances we
should be wary of ascribing to him any interest in comparative linguistics.

The Disappearing Evidence of Conflict
4.1
Zimmermann
We return to part (b) of Zimmermann’s remark (4) above. He seeks an explana-
tion of why Ibn al-Sarrāǧ and Fārābī “never seems to refer to the other, and why
the biographical tradition is virtually mute on the subject of their connexion”.
It is by no means clear that there is anything here that needs explaining. Medi-
eval Arabic writers in logic hardlyevermention linguists,and vice versa;maybe
nobody expected them to. The logicians almost never mention the Christian
scholars who created the Arabic translation of the Organon, one of the essen-
tial tools of Arabic logic at least up to Ibn Sīnā. Also it would be very unreal-
16
Hodges and Druart (2019 Section 2) consider some possible reasons for Fārābī’s objection
to this feature in languages.
17
For example at Ḥurūf 80 l. 6; 80 l. 9f.; 111 l. 2; 111 l. 4; 111 l. 11f.; 111 l. 18; 112 l. 3; 165 l. 18;
212 l. 18. We agree with Menn (2008) that the role played by Greek in Ḥurūf is that of a
language where supposedly the requirements of similarity are met (“where grammatical
form tracks logical form”, as Menn puts it on his page 68). But Menn might not agree with
us that since Fārābī makes no linguistic distinction between any of the “other languages”,
the same applies to all of them.

istic to suppose that every fruitful conversation between scholars came to the
attention of historians. But Zimmermann is not deterred; he crafts a theory to
explain the silence.
In his theory, an early collaboration between Fārābī and Ibn al-Sarrāǧ led to
a public estrangement between the two men, fortified by a
(10) campaign against Greek logic and philosophy […] carried by the powerful
religious wing of the grammatical community.
zimmermann 1981: cxxii
For his part Fārābī had
(11) a militant reaction to the opposition of those rejecting Greek thought
principally because it was un-Arabic and un-Islamic. His indignation at
what was unreasonable and noxious in the opposition’s campaign made
him impervious to justified criticism.
zimmermann 1981: cxxxviif
This is the context in which Fārābī allegedly challenges Arabic grammar by
importing the number five (2).
Well, one must form one’s own impressions. It seems to us that, far from
having any vendetta against the grammarians, Fārābī was in general a tolerant
and pacific writer. He believed that the teachings of Aristotle, interpreted in
the light of the Neoplatonism of the Roman Empire philosophical academies,
provided a useful general framework for understanding life and the universe
in general, and grammar in particular. His writings were intended to transmit
this belief to the Arabic-speaking intellectual world. Zimmermann’s story of a
feud between Fārābī and Ibn al-Sarrāǧ and other grammarians is not suppor-
ted by any evidence at all, but it makes for lively reading in a discipline that can
sometimes be dull and bookish.
Zimmermann’s remark (2) on fives is particularly ironic in view of a more
recent paper of Beata Sheyhatovitch (2019) on the role of the number five in
medieval Arabic grammar. To quote from her conclusion (2019: 107):
(12) […] in many cases the grammarians took pains to make the linguistic
material fit into a fivefold division, while ignoring (or pretending to ig-
nore) existing discrepancies. […]The fact that even al-ʾAstarābāḏī, known
for his non-conformism and originality, adheres to fivefold categorization
of tanwīn-s and tawābiʿ, despite his own criticism of them, proves that the
grammarians’ engagement with number ‘five’ goes beyond mere respect
for their predecessors’ authority.

fārābī against the grammarians??

4.2
Schöck
So Zimmermann’s account of an attack by Fārābī on traditional Arabic gram-
mar has shrivelled under close inspection. We will find the same with Schöck’s
claim of opposition between Fārābī and Arabic grammarians, but for a very
different reason. In her case we will conclude that her grasp of logic and its
relation to grammar is too weak to allow her to provide reliable information
about Fārābī’s relation to the grammarians.
The central thesis of her book (Schöck 2006) is that three communities
in the medieval Islamic empire, namely (a) early Muʿtazilite and Murǧiʿite
thinkers, (b) some grammarians from Sībawayhi onwards, and (c) Aristotelian
logicians, above all Fārābī, shared a number of concepts derived ultimately
from Aristotle’s logic, and this shared heritage allowed them to debate a num-
ber of issues across disciplinary boundaries.18 This thesis may have truth in it
and deserves to be examined. Schöck has assembled an impressive number of
texts that could be relevant to the thesis.
Problemsbeginassoonaswemovefromhercollectedtextstoherdiscussion
of them. These problems lie at two levels. First there are her starting assump-
tions, which seem to us in some cases mistaken about the facts or confused in
basic concepts, and in other places to go beyond what the known facts entitle
her to assume. Second there are her detailed claims about opposition between
Fārābī and the grammarians; these claims are flawed by both lack of essential
explanations and lack of evidence.
We begin with the starting assumptions. We confine ourselves to just three
examples of what are pervasive problems.
(i) One notion that she frequently calls on is proslepsis, as in the prosleptic
sentences of Theophrastus.19 She comments (2006: 432) that ‘in the Arabic
logic this kind of sentence is an interface between term-logic and propositional
logic’; she refers to her section 14.4.3.3 for details. But Schöck fails to establish
their relevance to Fārābī; the parallels that she draws in her 14.4.3.3 between
proslepsis and remarks of Fārābī are too crude and commonplace to show that
Fārābī had proslepsis in mind. In any case we know of no evidence that the
notion of proslepsis ever reached Fārābī. If it had done it would probably have
been through Alexander’s Commentary on Prior Analytics, specifically his com-
mentary on sections i.23 and i.29. But in 1013 Ibn Sīnā had not seen a translation
18
This is our summary, not hers. On her page 43 she speaks of the common property of
the learned classes in late antiquity, which had reached the Arabic world long before the
translations of Aristotle.

of Alexander of Aphrodisias’s (150–215?) Commentary that went as far as i.23,20
making it likely that Fārābī had not seen one either.21
(ii) The case of proslepsis illustrates her tendency to see detailed paral-
lels where there are only vague resemblances. A vivid example of this tend-
ency is her account of a discussion in which ʿUmar b. ʾAbī ʿUṯmān al-Šimmazī
(sic, al-Šammarī, dates unknown) extracted from ʾAbū Ḥanīfa the view that
people who professed belief in Allāh, but held wildly improbable beliefs about
such things as the identity of Muḥammad, should still be counted as believers
(Schöck 2005: 21f.). Schöck reports this as a refutation of ʾAbū Ḥanīfa which
uses the (Aristotelian) concepts of homonymity and synonymity and “proves
that ʾAbū Ḥanīfa violated the logical rules […]”.22 The source text (of ʾAšʿarī
[d. 324/936]) doesn’t refer to homonymity, synonymity or logic, and Schöck’s
reference to logical rules here must raise doubts about what she thinks a logical
rule is.
(iii) These doubts are reinforced when she tells us that Sībawayhi has his
own new “type of propositional logic”, different from the Stoic form and the
modern propositional logic (Schöck 2005: 88). Her basis for this claim seems to
be that she assumes Sībawayhi would regard Arabic sentences from the Qurʾān
as expressing necessary truths. But to belong to a “type of logic” the necessity
would have to follow some formal rules, and Schöck gives no evidence that
Sībawayhi had any such rules.There is a fundamental misunderstanding about
logic here. A similar misunderstanding about logic may lie behind her claim
(Schöck 2005: 358) that Sībawayhi took modus ponendo ponens to be a gram-
matical rule of Arabic.23
We turn to her more detailed claims about Fārābī’s Gegenposition in relation
to the grammarians. This is the topic of her ninety-page chapter 14, and there
are some relevant references to Fārābī elsewhere in her book. In this lengthy
20
In Muḫtaṣar (146 l. 5–7) and the closely associated Masāʾil (101.21–102.5) Ibn Sīnā says
that no Peripatetic logicians before him studied logical rules that yield hypothetical con-
clusions. Since Alexander’s Commentary mentions such rules (viz. totally hypothetical
syllogisms) at 265 l. 13, commenting on Prior Analytics i, 23, any copies available to Ibn
Sīnā must have stopped before i, 23.
21
Ibn al-Nadīm (Fihrist 405) in the 980s has just two copies of Alexander’s Commentary,
one of them “incomplete” and the other running only “to the end of the three categorical
figures” (i.e. to i, 7 or i, 22). Neither the texts cited in Fortenbaugh (1992:230–236) nor the
further discussion in Huby (2007:131–135) yield any evidence that Arabic logicians knew
of the notion of proslepsis.
22
Schöck 2005:21: “er nachwies, dass Abū Ḥanīfa die logischen Regeln verletzte, welche
Voraussetzung für die Wahrheit oder Falschheit einer Aussage sind”.
23
“[…] welchen Sībawaih zur grammatikalischen Regel des Arabischen erklärte”. She refers
to chapter 4 in support of this remark, but we found nothing relevant there. Grammatical
rules are about being well-formed, not about being true or necessarily true.

fārābī against the grammarians??

discourse it is not easy to make out exactly what she thinks are the points on
which Fārābī differs from the grammarians; but we found her making the fol-
lowing four points.
(1) Schöck devotes her chapter 4 (2005: 79–88) to the views of Sībawayhi,
comparing them with the views of some other writers. On page 81 she sets
out Fārābī’s theory that in sentences such as Q. 5/38 (wa-l-sāriqu wa-l-sāriqa
fa-qṭaʿū ʾaydiyahumā “The male and female thief, cut off their hands […]”)
a word beginning with the definite article, such as “the thief”, may be used
as a substitute for a more restrictive description which is the one that the
speaker or writer—in this case Allāh—intended.Writing “thief*” for the inten-
ded description, the sentence as a whole can then be read as referring to “every
thief*”.24 She comments (2005: 82) that Sībawayhi “chose a completely differ-
ent approach” to Q. 5/38, and goes on to explain that Sībawayhi regards the
sentence not as universally quantified but as a conditional: “If a person steals
then […]”.
There are two main problems with this contrast that Schöck draws between
Fārābī and Sībawayhi. The first is that although on her page 82 Schöck claims
to be talking about Sībawayhi’s interpretation of Q. 5/38, there are in fact only
two places where Sībawayhi mentions this Qurʾānic sentence in his Kitāb, and
in neither place does he say anything like what Schöck attributes to him.25
This is important for understanding Schöck, since it shows that her claim
aboutSībawayhi’s“completelydifferentapproach”isrelyingonwhatSībawayhi
says about a larger class of sentences, not just Q. 5/38. But she doesn’t tell us
what this larger class is. One class of sentences that she might have in mind
is the waʿd and waʿīd (Promise and Threat) verses from the Qurʾān, which
she discusses in her chapter 5. But we found no place where she attributes to
Sībawayhi any grammatical theory for this group of sentences.
The second problem will probably have already occurred to many readers.
In common speech the universally quantified sentence “Every sinner is an X”
and the conditional sentence “If anyone sins then he or she is an X” would nor-
mally be taken as conveying exactly the same information. Of course it would
be possible for Schöck to argue that in Qurʾānic exegesis the choice of one sen-
tence rather than the other should be understood as informative in some way;
24
This is indeed what Fārābī says in his essay on the application of syllogistic logic to fiqh,
which appears at the end of some manuscripts of his Qiyās and some manuscripts of his
work Qiyās ṣaġīr. See Qiyās 55 l. 13–56 l. 12. The passage is translated at Chatti and Hodges
(2020:155f.) with explanatory notes.
25
At Kitāb i, 60 l. 9 he discusses how the noun “thief” can be in the nominative. At Kitāb ii,
209 l. 9 he discusses the fact that this suffix is put in the dual rather than the plural.

but again we found no place where she offers such a suggestion. The outcome
is that we are left with no idea what contrast she is aiming to draw between the
approaches of Fārābī and Sībawayhi to this Qurʾānic sentence.
(2) On her page 299 she claims that Sībawayhi blurs the distinction between
a name and what it is a name of, whereas Fārābī corrects this misunderstand-
ing. To appreciate what the issue is here, we need to know more about what
view she is attributing to Sībawayhi. Is it perhaps just that he adopts some locu-
tions that are not strictly correct but are convenient and not likely to cause
misunderstandingsthatinterferewithhismessage?Weneverdiscover,because
the only references that Schöck gives for this confusion in Sībawayhi are to sec-
ondary sources.26
(3) On her page 295 she claims that Fārābī “liberated participles from being
linked to a determinate time”, and that this move was of fundamental import-
anceforthedevelopmentof syllogistic.27Thereseemstobeanimplicationhere
that Fārābī noticed possible relationships between participles and times, rela-
tionships which had not been noticed by the grammarians such as Sībawayhi.
Since her claim is lacking in specifics about just what the grammarians were or
weren’tawareof,weconfineourselvestoobservingthatSībawayhihimself took
it as clear that active participles sometimes act as nouns without attachment
to any determinate time.28
(4) On her page 370 she claims that ‘the grammarians’ believe, and Fārābī
denies, that it is legitimate to begin an induction from a single instance. This is
not an issue of grammar.
Summing up, it seems unlikely that Schöck would find evidence of a gram-
matical disagreement between Fārābī and Sībawayhi or other classical Arabic
grammarians, given her difficulties in formulating her claims without introdu-
cingconfusionsaboutthenatureof logic,grammarorboth.Aswesaid,hercase
for Fārābī’s Gegenposition against the grammarians shrivels under inspection.
26
She refers to note 29 in her chapter 7; this in turn refers to writings of Michel Allard (1924–
1976), Gerhard Endress and Ulrike Mosel.
27
“Fārābīs Befreiung dessen, was ein Partizip anzeigen kann, von der Verknāpfung mit einer
zeitlichen Bestimmung ist grundlegend für die Syllogistik.” It was Ibn Sīnā, a century later
than Fārābī, who first extended Aristotle’s syllogistic to allow inferences involving quan-
tification over times. Possibly he was influenced by Fārābī’s writings on participles, but
in Masāʾil (83 l. 6f.) the sources that he himself names as leading to this extension are
Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius (317?–388?), both much earlier than Fārābī.

Sībawayhiisof courseawareof constructionswhereanactiveparticipletakesfirstplacein
an ʾiḍāfa; normally in these constructions the participle behaves as a noun with no time
determination. He also knows that time quantifiers can be associated with active parti-

Conclusion
Sībawayhi collected a vast amount of detailed information about the Arabic
language, its grammar, pragmatics and phonology. With its help he came as
near as he could to a precise and accurate description of the language as a
coherent whole.
Fārābī also described the Arabic language, but from a very different point of
view. As a philosopher he preferred the big picture to the tiresome details, and
he liked answering broad questions about Why and How. At some points he
offered explanations for features of Arabic that we can verify from Sībawayhi’s
data.Butnopointsof conflictbetweenFārābī’stheoriesandthoseof Sībawayhi
have come to light.
Although Fārābī cast his explanations in terms that should apply to any lan-
guage, it is not established that he knew enough of any other language besides
Arabic to test his views on that other language.

Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s Classification of Pseudo-Objects
and the Grammatical Concept of faḍla
Hideki Okazaki
Introduction
Thispaper examinestheclassificationof mušabbahbi-l-mafʿūl (resemblingthe
mafʿūl, or pseudo-object) by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ (d. 316/929), using a chronological
analysis of the development of the grammatical concept of faḍla (redundant
element). Ibn al-Sarrāǧ divided the accusative complements of verbs into two
categories: mafʿūl (object) and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl. In his treatise al-ʾUṣūl fī
al-naḥw, he itemized five elements for each complement with specific termin-
ologies. The framework of five mafʿūl-s has remained stable since then and
has been dealt with as a principal category pertaining to a variety of accusat-
ive complements; in contrast, however, the framework of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl
failed to gain traction among Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s followers, and was only inconsist-
ently applied in later grammatical works. In the course of the recategorization
of accusative complements according to the concept of faḍla in the 7th/13th
century, it was found that the old framework of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl did not
encompassalltheaccusativecomplementsexcludedfromthelong-established
five mafʿūl-s. In this paper, we will consider the reasons why the framework
proposed by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ did not become standard and why grammarians
sought another way to categorize complements of accusative verbs, leading to
rearrangement through faḍla.

Thetermmafʿūl hasseveralmeaningsatdifferentlevelsof grammar.1Atthelex-
icological or morphological level, it is used to denote the word pattern of the
passive participle. At the level of syntax, it denotes “the accusative noun/pro-
noun on which the act of the verb ‘falls’” (Taha 2008: 100) and is sometimes

passive voice, and objective genitive) in Sībawayhi’s (d. 180/796?) Kitāb, cf. Kasher 2012:4–13.

translatedas“object”or“patient”.2Mafʿūlwasalsousedtorefertothesubjectof
averbinthepassivevoiceuntilthe7th/13thcentury,whenthisusewasreplaced
by the term al-nāʾib ʿan al-fāʿil (substitute agent). Some grammarians, such as
Sībawayhi and Mubarrad, used the term mafʿūl to denote the accusative verbal
noun, which they called maṣdar,3 in the same manner, the term mafʿūl was
used as an abbreviation for mafʿūl bihi (direct object).4 Besides these usages,
mafʿūl functioned as an umbrella term to place five types of nominal comple-
ments of the verb into the same category: mafʿūl muṭlaq5 (absolute object),
mafʿūl bihi (direct object), mafʿūl fīhi (locative object), mafʿūl lahu (reason
object), and mafʿūl maʿahu (accompaniment object).
Although each of these appears as a chapter title in al-ʾUṣūl fī al-naḥw, they
are not always used in the text, being replaced instead by some single word or
term without a prepositional phrase. The term mafʿūl muṭlaq,6 for example,
appears in ʾUṣūl only twice, in chapter titles; in the body text Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
consistently uses maṣdar (verbal noun), which appears 308 times in this work.
Mafʿūl fīhi,7 which appears five times, alternates with the terms ẓarf al-makān
and ẓarf al-zamān, used ten times each; moreover, plain ẓarf is used 192 times,
including in non-technical, everyday vocabulary. Mafʿūl itself occurs 417 times,
while mafʿūl bihi is used only 24 times across the three volumes of the work.8

Categorization of mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
The five categories into which Ibn al-Sarrāǧ classified mafʿūl used well-defined
terminology: mafʿūl muṭlaq, mafʿūl bihi, mafʿūl fīhi, mafʿūl lahu, and mafʿūl
2 This subject is too involved to be treated here in detail. For further discussion, cf. Peled
1999:53–54, 58, 76; Kasher 2012:3; Carter 2016:143.

5 For the word formation and the interpretation of mafʿūl muṭlaq, the post-Sībawayhian term
used by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, cf. Levin 1991.
6 In some later grammatical works, the term mafʿūl muṭlaq was replaced by the term maṣdar
in chapter titles. Širbīnī (d. 977/1570) criticized the trend, pointing out that maṣdar may be
in nominative and genitive form. Cf. Carter 1981:344; Peled 1999:85; Kasher 2019:206.

is used instead of ẓarf by Mubarrad (d. 285/898 or 286/899; cf. Mubarrad Muqtaḍab ii, 120
l. 2; iv, 328 l. 3), ẓarf also continued to be widely used by him and later grammarians.

pseudo-objects and the grammatical concept of faḍla

maʿahu (ʾUṣūl i, 158ff.).9 His treatise is characterized by the classification of
grammatical categories based on the principle of comprehensive division, and
thechaptersarearrangedaccordingtothisclassification.However,hisclassific-
ationof whathecalls“pseudo-objects”,mušabbahbi-l-mafʿūl,islesswellunder-
stoodthanhiscleardescriptionof mafʿūl.AcloselookrevealsthatIbnal-Sarrāǧ
recognized five types of pseudo-objects: ḥāl (circumstantial qualifier), tamyīz
(distinguishing element), istiṯnāʾ (exception), ḫabar kāna wa-ʾaḫawātihā (the
predicate of kāna and its related verbs), and ism ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātihā (subject-
noun of ʾinna and its related particles).
In the grammatical treatises of the post-Sībawayhian era until the 9th/15th
century, three technical terms, manṣūb, mafʿūl, and faḍla, complicate the over-
all picture of the basic theory of grammar. The manṣūb (“that which has been
made accusative”) is not a synonym for mafʿūl because the term manṣūb has a
particular role in the organization of the chapters of al-ʾUṣūl. Beginning with
the division of the parts of speech, the overall concepts of nouns, verbs, and
particles are given (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 36ff.). Following are chapters describing inflec-
tion, inflected parts of speech, invariability, and invariable parts of speech (cf.
ʾUṣūl i, 45ff.), a chapter on niʿma and biʾsa (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 111ff.), and a chapter on
nouns that were given the operative effect of the verb (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 122ff.), among
others. In parallel with this succession of chapters (bāb pl. ʾabwāb), another set
of chapters follow under the group title of ḏikr (mention). In volume i, three
ḏikr-s related to inflections are incorporated: mention of nouns in the nomin-
ative case, ḏikr al-ʾasmāʾ al-murtafiʿa (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 58ff.); mention of nouns in the
accusative case, ḏikr al-ʾasmāʾ al-manṣūbāt (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 158ff.); and mention of
the operator of genitive and nouns in the genitive case, ḏikr al-ǧarr wa-l-ʾasmāʾ
al-maǧrūra (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 408ff.). Most of the discussion of mafʿūl-s and mušab-
bah bi-l-mafʿūl occurs in ḏikr al-ʾasmāʾ al-manṣūbāt.
In al-ʾUṣūl, mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl are characterized as al-ʾasmāʾ
al-manṣūbāt, that is, substantives or nouns in the accusative case. Compared
to the categorization of mafʿūl, that of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl is not as clearly
defined, as subtypes are not enumerated in a single paragraph, making it dif-
ficult to grasp the overall structure that Ibn al-Sarrāǧ had in mind. Regardless,
9 It was not always true that the classification of five mafʿūl-s before the age of Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
was handed down and fully agreed to by later grammarians. Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī (d. 761/1360)
mentioned that “Zaǧǧāǧ deleted mafʿūl maʿahu and then incorporated it into mafʿūl bihi”,
while the “Kufan school deleted mafʿūl lahu and then incorporated it into mafʿūl muṭlaq” and
“Ǧawharī [d. 400/1009?] named mafʿūl dūnahu instead of mustaṯnā” (Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī
Qaṭr 219 l. 6–12). The Kufan school maintains that the verb has only one mafʿūl, that is mafʿūl
bihi, and the rest is mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl (Suyūṭī Hamʿ ii, 6 l. 1–2).

it is obvious that Ibn al-Sarrāǧ fundamentally recognized five mušabbah bi-l-
mafʿūl in two classes, the first one being “a formal accusative [which] may be
the same as the nominative in meaning” (qad yakūnu fīhi al-manṣūb fī al-lafẓ
huwaal-marfūʿfīal-maʿnā), and the second one “the formal accusative [which]
is not the same as the nominative, while an accusative (noun) belongs to the
same generic category as a nominative (noun)” (māyakūnual-manṣūbfī al-lafẓ
ġayr al-marfūʿ, wa-l-manṣūb baʿḍal-marfūʿ, ʾUṣūl i, 212).
The first class is further divided into three types, according to the operator
(ʿāmil) that is used in the sentence. First, when the operator is a real verb,
two types of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl are described: ḥāl and tamyīz (cf. ʾUṣūl i,
213). Second, for ḫabar kāna wa-ʾaḫawātihā (the predicate of kāna and related
verbs), the operator is not a real verb but is conjugated as a verb (cf. ʾUṣūl i,
228). Third, for ism ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātihā (a subject-noun for ʾinna and related
particles), the operator is a non-inflective particle (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 229).
The second class of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl is not divided into subcategories
consisting only of mustaṯnā (excepted element) and indicating that mustaṯnā
is similar to mafʿūl, as it comes after the verb is satisfied with its agent or after
the completion of an utterance (al-mustaṯnā yušbihu al-mafʿūl ʾiḏā ʾutiya bihi
baʿda istiġnāʾ al-fiʿl bi-l-fāʿil wa-baʿda tamām al-kalām, ʾUṣūl i, 281).
Before Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, his teacher Mubarrad had already postulated that
“nothing takes an accusativecase unless it isa mafʿūl ora mušabbahbi-l-mafʿūl,
structurally and semantically” (iʿlam ʾannahu lā yantaṣibu šayʾ ʾillā ʿalā ʾannahu
mafʿūl ʾaw mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl fī lafẓʾaw maʿnā, Muqtaḍab iv, 299). However,
Mubarrad does not give explicit definitions of mafʿūl or mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl,
nor does he list the items each comprises. Although both categories are men-
tioned in treatises before Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, 2nd/8th- and 3rd/9th-century gram-
matical works lack certain grammatical terminology, classification (taqsīm) of
subcategories of terms, and clear-cut chapter arrangements. For instance, the
technical term mafʿūl muṭlaq10 is not found in either Kitāb Sībawayhi or al-
Muqtaḍab.
3
Rearrangement of mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl
Although Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s classification of the five mafʿūl-s was accepted by his
successors in the 4th/10th century and afterwards, the framework of the five
mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl received some modifications.

pseudo-objects and the grammatical concept of faḍla
183
In his al-ʾĪḍāḥ, ʾAbū ʿAlī al-Fārisī (d. 377/987) included the same five accus-
ative complements, mafʿūl muṭlaq, mafʿūl bihi, mafʿūl fīhi, mafʿūl maʿahu, and
mafʿūl lahu (ʾĪḍāḥ150 l. 3–4), as in the mafʿūl framework in al-Sarrāǧ’s al-ʾUṣūl.
Nevertheless, a slight change can be pointed out, namely the reversal of the
order of the fourth and the fifth items, mafʿūl maʿahu, and mafʿūl lahu. As for
the mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl framework, Fārisī made a small change by adding
ḫabar mā, the predicate of negative particle mā (ʾĪḍāḥ171 l. 3).
In Kitāb al-Lumaʿ fī al-naḥw, Ibn Ǧinnī (d. 392/1002) followed Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s
classification exactly. At the beginning of his description of nouns in the accus-
ative (al-ʾasmāʾ al-manṣūba), Ibn Ǧinnī distinguishes mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-
l-mafʿūl and enumerates the five subcategories of mafʿūl (Lumaʿ 20 l. 10–11).
Each of these mafʿūl subcategories has a chapter further devoted to it.11 Fur-
thermore, Ibn Ǧinnī enumerated the five categories of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl
moreclearlythanIbnal-Sarrāǧdid,givingthemasḥāl,tamyīz,istiṯnāʾ,ismʾinna
wa-ʾaḫawātihā, and ḫabarkānawa-ʾaḫawātihā12 (Lumaʿ 26 l. 5–6). On the other
hand,itshouldbenotedthatinal-Ḫaṣāʾiṣ,IbnǦinnīdoesnotrefertotheframe-
work of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl.
Like Ibn Ǧinnī’s Kitāb al-Lumaʿ fī al-naḥw, Ǧurǧānī’s (d. 471/1078) Muqtaṣid,
a commentary on Fārisī’s al-ʾĪḍāḥ, also maintains Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s framework,
while by contrast, in al-ʿAwāmil al-miʾa al-naḥwiyya, Ǧurǧānī refers to five maf-
ʿūl-s, with a section dedicated to each (ʿAwāmil 285–287), but does not use
the term mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl. He describes ism ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātihā, istiṯnāʾ,
tamyīz, and ḫabar kāna wa-ʾaḫawātihā, each dealt with in a separate section
(ʿAwāmil 147, 189, 231, 251), but no section is dedicated to ḥāl.
In contrast, the subcategories of mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl in Zaǧ-
ǧāǧī’s (d. 337/949) Ǧumal, a compendium of Arabic grammar written in the
first half of the 4th/10th century, are not lineal descendants of Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s
ʾUṣūl, as Zaǧǧāǧī’s approach to the classification is different from that of Ibn al-
Sarrāǧ. For instance, when Zaǧǧāǧī refers to five mafʿūl-s in the chapter on their
division (bāb ʾaqsām al-mafʿūlīn, Ǧumal 305–310), he uses the term mafʿūl min
ʾaǧlihiinsteadof mafʿūllahu.13Likewise,Zaǧǧāǧīneverusesthetermmušabbah
bi-l-mafʿūl, instead dealing with ḥāl, tamyīz, istiṯnāʾ, ḫabarkānawa-ʾaḫawātihā,
11
Ibn Ǧinnī dedicated chapters 18 to 23 to describing mafʿūl subcategories. Mafʿūl fīhi was
treated in two chapters: ẓarf al-zamān and ẓarf al-makān (cf. Lumaʿ 24 l. 1–25 l. 3).

Although chapters 24, 25, and 26 are devoted to ḥāl, tamyīz, and istiṯnāʾ, respectively, kāna
wa-ʾaḫawātuhā and ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātuhā are treated in chapters 15 and 16 (cf. Ibn Ǧinnī
Lumaʿ 15–19).

and ism ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātihā in different places.14 A disparity in the use of the
term ḥāl between Zaǧǧāǧī and Ibn al-Sarrāǧ is apparent when ḥāl is presented
as a synonym for ẓarf and mafʿūl fīhi in Ǧumal.15
And mafʿūl fīhi is ẓarf and ḥāl, like your words: “Zayd came riding”. It
means that he came in such a way. Also, “he came rapidly”, “he came
riding”, “I went out on Friday”, “I sat in front of you”, “I stayed at your
home”. These types of ẓarf-s are mafʿūl fīhā [lit. that in which the action
is done]. (wa-l-mafʿūl fīhi al-ẓarf wa-l-ḥāl naḥwa qawlika “ǧāʾa zaydun

mafʿūl fīhā, Ǧumal 305 l. 10–13)
In the 5th/11th century, grammarians took a new approach to the categoriz-
ation of accusative complements, considering any accusative complement of
the verb, whether mafʿūl or mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl, to be a non-essential item.
Concerning “objectness” (mafʿūliyya), Zamaḫšarī (d. 538/1144; cf. Mufaṣṣal 18
l. 9–12) regards the five mafʿūl-s as one group, however, for remaining elements,
he lists seven: ḥāl, tamyīz, mustaṯnā, ḫabar kāna, ism ʾinna, lā li-nafy li-l-ǧins,
and ḫabar mā wa-lā, the last two being new to the framework.
Although Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s framework of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl was by and
large accepted by Ibn Ǧinnī, Fārisī, and Ǧurǧānī, the framework itself was fun-
damentally changed, at least after the 7th/13th century, by the grammarians
ʾAstarābāḏī (d. 688/1289?), Ibn Mālik (d. 672/1274), and their successors.

Instability of Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s Framework of mafʿūl and mušabbah
bi-l-mafʿūl
4.1
Distinction between mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl
Owens (1990: 161; 1991: 230–231) admitted the limitations of a syntactic basis
for distinguishing between mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl. He presented an
alternative view, proposing that the term for object, mafʿūl, was taken directly
from the Kitāb; allcategoriesthatSībawayhitermedmafʿūlwereconvertedinto

the class of “true” objects, while the accusatives that Sībawayhi did not desig-
nate as objects were consigned to the class of pseudo-objects.16
However,itremainsunclearwhythemafʿūlmaʿahuwassubsumedunderthe
categoryof mafʿūl,whilethemafʿūlminhu17(“thatwhichiswarnedabout”)was
not. Sībawayhi called it mafʿūl minhu with reference to the accusative form in
ʾiyyāka wa-l-ʾasada (“beware of the lion!”, Kitāb i, 116 l. 12–14). Although mafʿūl
minhu appears in the Kitāb, it was never included among the standard object
types by later grammarians; this accusative construction appears mostly in sec-
tions discussing warnings (taḥḏīr) without directly referring to mafʿūl minhu.18
Additionally, mafʿūl minhu is referred to by later grammarians, such as Ibn
Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī and Suyūṭī (d. 911/1505) to denote the accusative in a passage
from the Q. 7/155: wa-ḫtāra mūsā qawmahu sabʿīna raǧulan (“and Moses chose
from his people seventy men”).19 This construction is designated as mafʿūl
minhu because the accusative noun qawm-a, people, can be interpreted in
this sentence as synonymous with min qawm-i, from the people, in the gen-
itive. Although this Qurʾānic quotation is also found in grammatical works by
Sībawayhi, Mubarrad, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, and Zaǧǧāǧī, none of them mention mafʿūl
minhu in relation to it.20
Another question remains unsolved: why does Ibn al-Sarrāǧ exclude some
of the manṣūbāt from mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl ? The vocative noun (munādā, lit.
“a person called”) and the noun negated by lā (ism lā, lit. “a noun of lā”) are
generally listed among the manṣūbāt in grammatical works, but they are not
regarded as mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ.
The vocative noun which takes an accusative in a construction such as yā
ʿabda llāhi (O ʿAbd Allāh!) is not regarded as mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl even though
its chapter in Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s work is listed among the manṣūbāt. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
explains that the vocative noun takes the accusative ending because the voc-
ative particle yā acts as a representative of the verb ʾunādī21(I call, ʾUṣūl i, 333
l. 2). However, the vocative noun ends in the vowel /u/ when it is a single noun,

and ʾurīdu (ʾUṣūl i, 340 l. 6). See also Muqtaḍab iv, 202 l. 2.

okazaki
e.g. yā zaydu (O Zayd!). Ibn al-Sarrāǧ assumes that it is indeclinable (mabnī)
not declinable (muʿrab), and is in the accusative grammatical position (ʾUṣūl i,
332 l. 2–4).
The noun negated by lā is also excluded from mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl. The
noun, raǧula takes an accusative marker without nunation in a construction
such as lā raǧula fi-l-dāri (There is no man in the house). It is obvious that
Ibn al-Sarrāǧ does not regard such an accusative as a real one as is clear in his
expression: “the vowel /a/ that resembles the accusative” (al-fatḥallaḏī yušbihu
al-naṣb, ʾUṣūl i, 379 l. 1).
4.2
Categorization of ḥāl and mafʿūl fīhi
In the framework given by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, ḥāl (circumstantial qualifier) is placed
in the category of mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl, while mafʿūl fīhi (locative object) is
situated in the mafʿūl group. In an early stage of the development of Arab
grammaticalthought,aterminologicalconfusionappearedconcerningḥāland
mafʿūl fīhi. In some contexts where ḥāl is discussed in the Kitāb,22 some ambi-
guity can be observed in the use of the term mafʿūl fīhi, where expressions like
hāḏā ʿabdu llāhi munṭaliqan “here is ʿAbd Allāh leaving” are discussed (Kitāb i,
221 l. 19–222 l. 2).23
Zaǧǧāǧī clearly distinguishes between ḥāl and mafʿūl fīhi, which he calls al-
ẓarf min al-zamān and al-ẓarf min al-makān (Ǧumal 44 l. 9, 45 l. 13, 46 l. 10),
whilealsoidentifyingmafʿūlfīhiwithḥāl,24asinwa-l-mafʿūlfīhial-ẓarf wa-l-ḥāl
naḥwa qawlika “ǧāʾa zaydun rākiban” maʿnāhu ǧāʾa fī miṯl hāḏihi al-ḥāl (Ǧumal
305 l. 9–10).25 This non-standard view, which places ḥāl in mafʿūlāt, is noted by
Ibn ʿUṣfūr (d. 669/1271; šǧ ii, 450 l. 11–15).
4.3
Ḫabar kāna
Ibn al-Sarrāǧ focuses on the concept of the operator, ʿāmil, when he classifies
memberswithinthemušabbahbi-l-mafʿūl framework.Hemaintainsthatḫabar
kāna, predicate of the verb kāna, shares a common feature with ḥāl and tamyīz
in light of the fact that they take “the accusative case in form which may be the
same as the nominative case in meaning” (ʾUṣūl i, 212 l. 17–18). He thereafter
divides them into two categories on the basis of their operator, ʿāmil. Ḥāl and
22
The grammatical construction of ḥāl is commented on in Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 15–16, 158–
159, 161–163, 168–170, 211–212, 218–224.
23
Cf. also Levin 1979b:194; Versteegh 2008:108. Peled (1999:77) pointed out that Mubarrad
presents ḥāl as a grammatical category with the status of a mafʿūl fīhi (Muqtaḍab iv, 166).
24
The term ḥāl is also used by Zaǧǧāǧī to denote the present tense (Ǧumal 21–22).

pseudo-objects and the grammatical concept of faḍla
187
tamyīz have a real verb, fiʿl ḥaqīqī as an operator, whereas ḫabar kāna does not,
because, while that the operator has some kind of verbal pattern and behaves
the same as the verb, it is not a real verb, al-ʿāmil fīhi šayʾun ʿalā waznal-fiʿli, wa-
yataṣarrafu taṣarrufahu wa-laysa bi-fiʿlin fī al-ḥaqīqa (ʾUṣūl i, 213 l. 2–3).26 In a
construction such as kānazaydunmunṭaliqan, “Zayd was leaving”, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
regards the verb kāna as a non-real verb, fiʿl ġayr ḥaqīqī,27 which only denotes
time, zamān (ʾUṣūl i, 74 l. 5–6; 82 l. 5–6).28
The above-discussed approach is appropriate for a design to consolidate
the mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl complements. Nevertheless, the members within the
category do not share any stable syntactic or semantic grounds to create a
framework. For instance, the essential distinction between ḫabar kāna and the
rest of the categories in mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl, including the adverbial accus-
atives, can be explained not only by the operator ḫabar kāna has but also by
the sentence/clause structure itself, and Ibn al-Sarrāǧ does this in the chapter
dealing with the five complements in the accusative case. He posits an underly-
ing mubtadaʾ–ḫabar, or topic–comment, structure in a sentence. An example
is, kāna ʿabdu l-lāhi ʾaḫāka, “Abdallah was your brother” in contrast to the
fāʿil–mafʿūl structure in ḍaraba ʿabdu l-lāhi ʾaḫāka, “Abdallah hit your brother”.
Basedonthispremise,Ibnal-Sarrāǧexplainsthatʾaḫākaintheformersentence
(=ḫabarkāna)is intheaccusativecasebyreferringtoitsresemblancetomafʿūl
in the latter sentence.29 Such a description also shows that ḫabar kāna is dis-
tinguished from ḥāl and tamyīz by the status of the accusative complement.
The predicate ʾaḫāka (= ḫabar kāna) in the sentence kāna ʿabdu l-lāhi ʾaḫāka,
is indispensable, whereas rākiban (= ḥāl) is not in a construction such as ǧāʾa
ʿabdu l-lāhi rākiban, “Abdallah came riding”. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ explains that rākiban
(= ḥāl) is put in the accusative by resemblance with mafʿūl, inasmuch as it was
added after the completion of the predication. In addition, the fāʿil is complete
with its verb (istiġnāʾ al-fāʿil bi-fiʿlihi, ʾUṣūl i, 213 l. 6–9).
It should also be noted that no more than six lines are devoted to the discus-
sion of ḫabar kāna within the section on mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl (ʾUṣūl i, 228–
229). Most of the structures with the verb kāna wa-ʾaḫawātuhā are discussed in
the section on mušabbah bi-l-fāʿil fī al-lafẓ(resembling the fāʿil on the surface
26
Cf. Muqtaḍab iii, 33 l. 4–5.
27
Ibn al-Sarrāǧ also uses the term ʾafʿāl fī al-lafẓ(ʾUṣūl i, 74 l. 5), which can be interpreted
as “verbs which conform to the category of verbs only in terms of their morphological
patterns (Taha 1995:128–131)”.
28
Cf. Levin 1979b:186; Taha 1995:106, 127, 302ff.; 2008:105.
29
Cf. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, ʾUṣūl i, 82 l. 9–12. Sībawayhi called a subject of kāna “ism al-fāʿil” or “al-
fāʿil” and an object of kāna “ism al-mafʿūl” or “al-mafʿūl” (Kitāb i, 16, 17, 63). He also used
the term ḫabar kāna (Kitāb i, 63). Cf. also Levin 1979b:187.

level), which is listed in the fifth of the five nominative complements (ʾUṣūl i,
58; 81ff.).
4.4
Classification into Five Types30 by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
Asmentionedabove,Ibnal-Sarrāǧseparatesmafʿūl frommušabbahbi-l-mafʿūl,
classifying the accusative elements into five types (ʾUṣūl i, 159 l. 8).
As for the nominative forms of nouns (al-ʾasmāʾ al-murtafiʿa), they are simil-
arly divided into five types, expressly using the numeral ḫamsa, five (ʾUṣūl i, 58
l. 2): mubtadaʾ (lit. “that which is begun with”), ḫabar (lit. “the information”),
fāʿil (lit. “the doer”), mafʿūl allaḏī lam yusamma man faʿala bihi (lit. “the object
of which no agent has been named”), and mušabbah bi-l-fāʿil (lit. “resembling
the fāʿil”, ʾUṣūl i, 58, 62, 72, 76, 81). He follows a similar pattern when he illus-
trates the accusative nominals.
Furthermore, many other grammatical categories are classified into five
types in al-ʾUṣūl.31 For instance, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ enumerates five particles of
swearing (qasam), wa-, bi-, ta-, li-, and min, which include some rare ones32
(ʾUṣūli,430).Healsoitemizesfiveparticlesforcalling, yā,ʾayā,hayā,ʾay,andʾa-
(nidāʾ, ʾUṣūl i, 329), whereas many later grammarians describe six.33 Moreover,
ʾinna and its related particles are regarded as making up a group of five, ʾinna,
lākinna, layta, laʿalla, and ka-ʾanna (ʾUṣūl i, 229–230), excluding ʾanna, which is
also included by many other grammarians.34
The examples mentioned above show that Ibn al-Sarrāǧ had a strong inclin-
ation to find a group of five for every grammatical category. It is probable that
he classified mafʿūl-s and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl each into five types not only to
create a purely linguistic framework according to the theoretical background
but also to pursue beauty of form in his framework or to comply with pedago-
gical demands.
30
For a detailed study on fivefold divisions in medieval Arabic grammatical literature, cf.
Sheyhatovitch 2019.
31
In ʾUṣūl, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ does not mention the “five/six nouns”: ʾabū, ʾaḫū, ḥamū, fū, ḏū, and
hanū. For the grammarians’ positions on this issue, cf. Sartori 2010:36.
32
Zaǧǧāǧī enumerates four: wa-, bi-, ta-, and li- (Ǧumal 82 l. 4). Ibn Ǧinnī and Ǧurǧānī enu-
merate only three: bi-, wa-, and ta- (Lumaʿ 73 l. 3; ʿAwāmil 139–141). Zamaḫšarī enumerates
four: wa-, ta-, li-, and min (Mufaṣṣal 345 l. 5).
33
Many grammarians, including Zaǧǧāǧī, Ibn Ǧinnī, Ǧurǧānī, and Ibn Mālik, itemize five
(Ǧumal 168 l. 1; Lumaʿ 43 l. 17; ʿAwāmil 196; ʾAlfiyya v. 573). Others, like Zamaḫšarī and Ibn
Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī, also added wā, for six (Mufaṣṣal 309 l. 10; Qaṭr 242–244).
34

5
Grammatical Concept of faḍla
Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s arrangement of mafʿūl-s and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl into groups
of five was a turning point. Before his time, the accusative complements were
not yet all theoretically established, and some had their own distinct concep-
tualterminology.However,Ibnal-Sarrāǧ’sframeworkwasnotstraightforwardly
inherited by later grammarians, who instead sought a way to modify the frame-
work and arrange it using the concept of faḍla, which is often translated as a
redundant element.35
Before the 4th/10th century, the use of the term faḍla was limited. In early
grammatical sources, various terms were used for redundant elements in an
utterance, including zāʾid, faḍl, tawkīd, ḥašw, ṣila, and laġw.36 While Sībawayhi
did not use faḍla himself, he recognized the concept;37 its use is also attested
in the 3rd/9th-century grammatical work al-Muqtaḍab. Both Ibn al-Sarrāǧ and
Ibn Ǧinnī use the term in their works, but Zaǧǧāǧī38 does not.
In general, faḍla refers to accusative complements or non-predicative ele-
ments. Mubarrad describes it as ʾiḏā ḏakartahu zidta fī al-fāʾida, wa-ʾiḏā ḥaḏaf-
tahu lam tuḫlil bi-l-kalām, (Muqtaḍab iii, 116 l. 4), which Taha (2008: 100) inter-
prets as “an element which adds to the meaning expressed by the verb and
its agent and whose omission from speech does not affect the integrity of the
text”.39 This includes structural items that are not requisite in a sentence or a
clause because the meaning of the sentence or the clause is already complete
(baʿda tamām al-kalām)40 without them. This can be contrasted with the term
ʿumda of later grammarians, which constitutes an essential part of the predic-
ation.
To all appearances, the term faḍla is related to other grammatical terms,
such as manṣūb or mafʿūl, when it is viewed diachronically through the history
of Arab traditional grammar.

5.1
Faḍla in Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s ʾUṣūl
Faḍla is seemingly not used in Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s ʾUṣūl to cover all complements
in the category of mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl. Instead, he uses the term
sporadically, without precisely defining it and without mentioning which com-
plements of verbs belong to this category. It should be noted that his teacher
Mubarrad provides a more detailed, though still incomplete, picture of the
term; Mubarrad presents the three elements ḥāl, ẓarf, and maṣdar41 as ex-
amples of faḍla (Muqtaḍab iii, 116 l. 3–4; Taha 1995: 114. Cf. Muqtaḍab iii, 121
l. 18).
Although Ibn al-Sarrāǧ only once relates istiṯnāʾ to faḍla, in a phrase, ḥattā
yakūnaal-istiṯnāʾfaḍla, “until (the accusative noun after) the exceptive particle
becomes redundant” (ʾUṣūl i, 300 l. 16), he does not intend to indicate that
istiṯnāʾ is included in the category of faḍla. It should be noted that Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
does not assign a role to the term faḍla in the categorization of accusative
complements. In several instances, he uses the term faḍla in the sense of “a
redundant element”. He implicitly correlates faḍla and mafʿūl in the context
of a sentence with a verb and a subject, which is followed by silence, sukūt
and the fāʾida42 is completed with it to the addressee. He explains that the
utterance, kalām, is completed without a mafʿūl, inasmuch as it is a faḍla, a
redundant element (ʾUṣūl i, 74 l. 16–75 l. 2). In this context, the term faḍla
is used to refer to the dispensable complement added to the complete sen-
tence consisting of the verb and its agent. In other contexts that Ibn al-Sarrāǧ
calls mafʿūl a faḍla, in expressions al-mafʿūl faḍla (the mafʿūl is a faḍla),
or al-mafʿūl allaḏī huwa faḍla (lit. the mafʿūl which is a faḍla),43 the term
faḍla is not used to refer to the specific member within the mafʿūl frame-
work.
Therefore, we cannot determine whether faḍla refers to the direct object
(mafʿūl bihi) or to the object in a general sense, as an accusative element.44
According toTaha, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ considered mafʿūl bihi to have a distinct status
of other redundant items. Although the term faḍla implies that a verbal sen-
tence can be represented by the verb and the agent only on the level of the
surface structure, the semantic status of the object must not be considered to

it is used frequently in the sense of ‘communicative value’.

be that of a redundant item because the meaning of a transitive verb is only
complete with the inclusion of its direct object (Taha 1995: 149; 2008: 102). This
interpretation is rooted in Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s description: “For the direct object of
the verb [there exists] a share in the verb as [it is the case] for the agent […]”45
(li-l-mafʿūl ḥiṣṣa min al-fiʿl kamā li-l-fāʿil, ʾUṣūl i, 412 l. 3). Ibn al-Sarrāǧ believes
that the existence of the mafʿūl is indispensable for expression with transit-
ive verbs (ʾafʿāl mutaʿaddiya) in sentences like: ḍarabtu zaydan “I hit Zayd” and
ʾakaltu al-ṭaʿāma “I ate the food”. He says that ḍarabtu “I hit”, and ʾakaltu “I ate”,
cannot be uttered without mafʿūl-s (cf. ʾUṣūl i, 171 l. 11).46Therefore,Taha states,
Mubarrad’s description “may be taken to mean that the term faḍla does not
apply to the direct object” (1995: 116).
5.2
Ibn Ǧinnī’s Eight faḍalāt
In Ibn Ǧinnī’s al-Ḫaṣāʾiṣ, the term faḍla is more explicitly connected to the
accusative case.47 Al-Ḫaṣāʾiṣis one of the earliest treatises to enumerate the
specific constituents of faḍalāt: mafʿūl bihi, ẓarf, mafʿūl lahu, mafʿūl maʿahu,
maṣdar, ḥāl, tamyīz, and istiṯnāʾ (Ḫaṣāʾiṣi, 197 l. 4–6).48 However, it is not cer-
tain whether Ibn Ǧinnī regards all eight as constituting faḍalāt, as he mentions
nothing about whether ismʾinnawa-ʾaḫawātihā and ḫabarkānawa-ʾaḫawātihā
constitute faḍla, both of which are included in mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl in his
Lumaʿ (26 l. 5–6).
Although Ibn Ǧinnī states unequivocally that mafʿūl bihi is a faḍla (Ḫaṣāʾiṣ
i, 196 l. 16), he distinguishes it from other faḍalāt and assigns it a special status.
Further,IbnǦinnīmakesnoindicationthatmafʿūlbihiisacandidate faḍlathat
canbeaddedafterthecompletionof asentencesuchasinṭalaqazaydun(“Zayd
has left”, Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 379 l. 7–8), excluding it while describing maṣdar, ẓarf, ḥāl,
mafʿūl lahu, and mafʿūl maʿahu as possible elements to be added to the sen-
tence. This implies that he recognizes the difference between mafʿūl bihi and
other faḍalāt with regard to syntactic and semantic structure.
Interestingly, in Ibn Ǧinnī’s Lumaʿ, in contrast to Ḫaṣāʾiṣ, the word faḍla is
used only twice (Lumaʿ 20 l. 15, 67 l. 3), and only three elements: maṣdar, ẓarf,
and ḥāl, appear in the context.
45
The translation is Taha’s (cf. Taha 1995:150; 2008:102). The mafʿūl here is interpreted as
mafʿūl bihi. On the problematic issue of the syntactic status of mafʿūl bihi within the
framework of faḍla, cf. also Taha 2008:100.

48
Elsewhere, he mentioned four items as exemplifying faḍalāt: ẓarf, ḥāl, tamyīz, and istiṯnāʾ
(Ibn Ǧinnī Ḫaṣāʾiṣii, 274 l. 12).

Faḍla continued to have limited use in grammatical works from the 4th/10th
to the 6th/12th centuries: Zaǧǧāǧī, al-Ǧumal and al-ʾĪḍāḥfī ʿilal al-naḥw; Ibn
Ǧinnī, Kitābal-Lumaʿfīal-naḥw;Ǧurǧānī, Kitābal-Muqtaṣidfīšarḥal-ʾĪḍāḥ;Ibn
al-ʾAnbārī (d. 577/1181), ʾAsrāral-ʿarabiyya; and Zamaḫšarī, al-Mufaṣṣalfīʿilmal-
ʿarabiyya (cf. Mufaṣṣal 61 l. 1, 69 l. 5).
5.3
Faḍla in ŠarḥKāfiyat Ibn al-Ḥāǧib (d. 646/1249)
While Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s treatment of mafʿūl is characterized by a semantic
approach, later grammarians adopted a structural approach, using faḍla to
refer to any accusative complement (cf.Taha 2008: 103). From the 7th/13th cen-
tury on, the term began to be used in the classification of mafʿūlāt or manṣūbāt,
notably in ʾAstarābāḏī’s ŠarḥKāfiyat Ibn al-Ḥāǧib.49 ʾAstarābāḏī paraphrases
Ibn al-Ḥāǧib’s saying “The accusatives are what comprises a marker of object-
ness” (al-manṣūbāt huwa mā ištamala ʿalā ʿalam al-mafʿūliyya, šk i, 112 l. 24) as
“The accusative is a marker of faḍla”, and based on this he enumerates twelve
kinds of manṣūbāt. Thus, he writes, the faḍalāt are ḥāl, tamyīz, and mustaṯnā
in addition to the five mafʿūl-s (al-mafāʿīl al-ḫamsa). The four mušabbah bi-
l-faḍalāt are ism ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātihā, ism lā al-tabriʾa, ḫabar mā al-ḥiǧāziyya,
and ḫabar kāna wa-ʾaḫawātihā (šk i, 113 l. 3–5). Thus, the five mafʿūl-s and
five mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl in Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s al-ʾUṣūl are recategorized into eight
faḍalāt and four mušabbah bi-l-faḍalāt. These eight elements correspond to
what Ibn Ǧinnī describes as faḍalāt in al-Ḫaṣāʾiṣ(i, 197 l. 4–6).
Suyūṭī’s set formula for the types of inflection is also based on the correl-
ation between the framework of faḍla and the accusative case endings: rafʿ
li-l-ʿumad, wa-naṣb li-l-faḍalāt, wa-ǧarr li-mā baynahumā, that is, a nominative
to the ʿumad (pl. of ʿumda), an accusative to the faḍalāt (pl. of faḍla), and a
genitive to the things between (Hamʿ i, 75 l. 2). It is safe to say that the faḍla, as
far as ʾAstarābāḏī and Suyūṭī are concerned, is a hypernym for mafʿūl because
five mafʿūl-s and three other items are included in the framework of faḍla (cf.
šk i, 113 l. 3–5; Hamʿ i, 75 l. 1–8).
5.4
Continual Rearrangement of mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl
AlthoughIbnal-Sarrāǧdidnotexplicitlymentionthearrangementof theseele-
ments, he was likely conscious of the order of the five mafʿūl-s, beginning with
mafʿūl muṭlaq and ending with mafʿūl maʿahu, implying a hierarchy. Indeed,
Ibn al-Sarrāǧ seems to prioritize mafʿūl muṭlaq, designating it al-mafʿūl al-
49
For a more detailed discussion of faḍla in the ŠarḥKāfiyat Ibn al-Ḥāǧib, especially on
numerals, cf. Druel 2018:103–109.

ṣaḥīḥ,50 the true object (ʾUṣūl i, 159 l. 16). As this order did not change in the
grammatical works written between the 4th/10th and 6th/12th centuries, it
might imply the importance of the items.
The framework of the five mafʿūl-s as a subcategory of faḍalāt was main-
tained after the 7th/13th century, but the order changed to beginning with
mafʿūl bihi. As far as we can determine, al-ʾAlfiyya by Ibn Mālik was, if not the
oldest, certainly one of the oldest works to adopt this new order. The 8th/14th-
century grammarian Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī also noted that the order begins
with mafʿūl bihi: “I began among them with mafʿūl bihi just as Fārisī or oth-
ers did such as the author of al-Tashīl or the author of al-Muqarrib (cf. št ii, 79,
107; Muqarrib 174, 194). I did not begin with al-mafʿūl al-muṭlaq, as Zamaḫšarī
and Ibn al-Ḥāǧib did” (Šuḏūr 177 l. 5–7). The 9th/15th-century scholar Suyūṭī
also began with mafʿūl bihi among the faḍalāt, indicating that beginning with
mafʿūl muṭlaq was closely tied to the Basran school (Hamʿ ii, 5 l. 14–15).
The 15-manṣūbāt framework began to be used in treatises in the 8th/14th
century. In his Šuḏūral-ḏahab, Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī mentioned that “manṣūbāt
are restricted to 15 types”; the use of the number 15 was a new trend for classi-
fying mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl. In Šuḏūr al-ḏahab, the traditional five-
mafʿūl framework was maintained and the priority of mafʿūl-s among man-
ṣūbāt was kept. In fact, Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī began his arrangement with the
five mafʿūl-s because “mafʿūl-s are fundamental” (Šuḏūr 177 l. 4–5).
Furthermore, there was also a trend of significant change in the five-mafʿūl
framework itself. While Ibn ʾĀǧurrūm (d. 723/1323) also adopted the 15-manṣū-
bāt framework, he made a drastic change in their order, placing mafʿūl min
ʾaǧlihi tenth and mafʿūl maʿahu eleventh (Carter 1981: 326, 432, 440). These two
mafʿūl-s were thus separated from the other three, which continued to enjoy
priority in the arrangement.

Conclusion
WehaveanalyzedhowIbnal-Sarrāǧ’ssubcategoriesof mafʿūlandmušabbahbi-
l-mafʿūl were modified from the 4th/10th to the 7th/13th century. He managed
to establish the framework for accusative complements using the term mafʿūl
and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl, which were taken over by subsequent grammatical
treatises. His system of categorizing and itemizing the elements seems well
organized, and the framework of five mafʿūl-s and five mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl

might have a considerable advantage, especially, for the purpose of pedagogy.
However, his classification was not justified enough to convince later gram-
marians, partly because of his prioritizing the five-fold division in the classific-
ationof grammaticalitems.Itseemsquiteprobablethatthelimitedavailability
of syntactic explanations regarding accusative complements led later gram-
marianstoseekanalternativeframework,inwhichtheconceptof faḍlaplayed
a significant role.
The term faḍla is seemingly not used in Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s ʾUṣūl to comprise all
complements in the category of mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl. Indeed, the
expression al-mafʿūl faḍla (the mafʿūl is a faḍla) is employed by Ibn al-Sarrāǧ,
but the term faḍla is used in the sense of “a redundant element”, and not used
to refer to the specific member within the mafʿūl framework.
We can also confirm that, in the 4th/10th century, soon after Ibn al-Sarrāǧ,
Ibn Ǧinnī attempted to describe accusative complements in terms of both
mafʿūl and faḍla. Ibn Ǧinnī’s description of the eight faḍalāt laid the found-
ations for the later modification of the framework by ʾAstarābāḏī. Further
research on changes in the concept of faḍla between the 4th/10th and the
7th/13th century would help to clarify the modification of the framework of
mafʿūl and mušabbah bi-l-mafʿūl.

Suprasegmental Criteria in Medieval Arabic
Grammar
Manuel Sartori
Introduction*
“What’sthedifferencebetweenbadalandʿaṭf bayān?”.1Hereisastudent’sques-
tion, quite legitimate, but which, interestingly enough, does not have an imme-
diate answer, which seems to signal its “problematic” nature. The crux of the
problem lies, in short, in how to tell them apart and account for the differences
between ʿaṭf bayān on the one hand and badal on the other hand.
So let’s pose the problem as it stands to the attentive reader: what is the
differencebetweenmuḥammadof al-ṣalātuwa-l-salāmuʿalānabiyyihimuḥam-
madin and ʿumar of ʾaqsama bi-l-llāhi ʾabū ḥafṣin ʿumar (< ʿumaru2), the first
being categorized by Arabic grammar as badal and the second as ʿaṭf bayān?
What are the criteria for distinguishing what seems to be exactly the same,
as will be shown in the following two examples borrowed from Ibn Ǧinnī
(d. 392/1002) in his Lumaʿ fī al-ʿarabiyya:

Revised and expanded version of “La différence entre badal et ʿaṭf bayān. Mutisme et surdité
des grammaires de l’arabe ?” published in French in Al-Qanṭara (2018).
1 In the rest of this article I will keep the terms badal (permutative), mubdal minhu (that for
which the badal is substituted), ʿaṭf al-bayān (explanatory apposition), but sometimes also
those of ṣifa (qualification, adjectival qualifier), naʿt (adjective) and tawkīd (corroboration)
in transcription to simplify the translation. I will also keep the translation of the examples.
2 The pausal form is here necessitated by rhyme since it is a raǧaz by ʾAbū al-Ǧaḥḥāf Ruʾba b.
ʿAbd al-ʿAǧǧāǧ b. Ruʾba al-Tamīmī al-Saʿdī (d. 145/762).

These two structures are, from a written point of view, strictly identical and yet
categorized differently to the point that even a grammarian and logician like
Raḍī al-Dīn al-ʾAstarābāḏī (d. 688/1289?) comes to write this:
I say: so far, no obvious difference has appeared to me between the badal
of the whole for the whole and the ʿaṭf al-bayān, and I believe that ʿaṭf al-
bayān is nothing but badal, as this is obvious in Sībawayhi’s remark, since
he does not mention the ʿaṭf al-bayān, but says: “as to substituting the
definite expression for the indefinite expression, like marartu bi-raǧulin
ʿabdi llāhi ‘I passed by a man ʿAbd Allāh’, it is as if someone has asked:
bi-man mararta ‘by whom did you pass?’ or that [the speaker] has ima-
gined that it was said to him and that consequently, he puts in its place
what is more defined than it [the indefinite expression]”. (ʾaqūlu wa-ʾanā
ʾilā al-ʾāna lam yaẓhar lī farq ǧalī bayn badal al-kull min al-kull wa-bayn
ʿaṭf al-bayān bal lā ʾarā ʿaṭf al-bayān ʾillā al-badal ka-mā huwa ẓāhir kalām

wa-l-maʿrifa min al-maʿrifa)
The fact that even such a distinguished grammarian and logician as ʾAstarā-
bāḏī was confused by the problem suggests that it was unusually difficult, and
indeed we find similar confusion in the works of other Arab grammarians. As
we shall show, some of them reduce this difference to merely inflectional or, at
best, pragmatic criteria, while others invoke an entirely different criterion, one
which is more hinted at than explicitly stated. The latter approach has been

ily on the traditional formal analysis, thereby increasing the need to rescue it
from neglect.

The Traditional Approach
1.1
The Reasons for This Embarrassment
Let us recall briefly that the two types under study, badal and ʿaṭf bayān, belong
to the generic category known as tawābiʿ that is to say to the class of apposit-
ives. In the terms of traditional Arabic grammar, these appositives are five in
number:ṣifa(ornaʿt),adjectivalqualification;taʾkīd (ortawkīd),corroboration;
badal,permutation;ʿaṭf bayān,explanatoryapposition;andʿaṭf nasaq,coordin-
ation (cf. Ġalāyīnī Ǧāmiʿ iii, 169–190). Even if the last of these, unlike the first
four, is not a juxtaposition, we can distinguish in each of them at least a cat-
egorized term as tābiʿ, that is to say an appositive, and preceding it, its matbūʿ,
that is to say the term which is followed by the appositive, the tābiʿ following
(generally) in declension its matbūʿ.
If the ʿaṭf al-bayān does not have subdivisions, the same is not true for the
badal as stated by ʾAstarābāḏī in the quote above. The badal is subdivided into
four types,3 respectively badal al-kull min al-kull (substitution of the whole for
the whole); badal al-baʿḍmin al-kull (substitution of the part for the whole);
badal al-ištimāl (inclusive substitution); al-badal al-mubāyin (the contradict-
ory substitution), itself subdivided into three sub-types which are badal al-
ġalaṭ(substitution of error), badal al-nisyān (substitution of oversight) and
badal al-ʾiḍrāb (substitution of retractation, cf. Ġalāyīnī Ǧāmiʿ iii, 179–180 and
Yaʿqūb 2006: iv, 88).4
According to Rafael Talmon (1948–2004), the ʿaṭf al-bayān would be a syn-
tactic innovation (maybe we should rather say conceptual) which was intro-
duced by Sībawayhi (d. 180/796?), who granted it a degree of autonomy ap-
proaching that of a ṣifa (cf. Talmon 1981: 279). According to an Arab gram-
marian, Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī (d. 456/1064), the ʿaṭf al-bayān actually seems
to be problematic since he writes in his Šarḥal-Lumaʿ:
3 One of the first to mention them is Mubarrad (d. 285/898 or 286/899; Muqtaḍab i, 66–68 and
iv, 528–530).
4 The translations given here to these terms are that of Carter (cf. Širbīnī Nūr 474). I will only
note that for ʾAstarābāḏī al-badal al-mubāyin is, in fact, al-badal al-ġalaṭand that under this
latter, he distinguishes, in the order stated here, the types of ġalaṭṣarīḥmuḥaqqaq (substitu-
tion of a real error) then of ġalaṭnisyān (substitution of oversight) and then finally of ġalaṭ
badāʾ (substitution of second thought) (cf. ʾAstarābāḏī šk ii, 403–404). On his side, Wright
(1830–1889) reduces to two the sub-types of the badal al-ġalaṭ, subsuming badal al-ʾiḍrāb
(the permutative of retractation) with badal al-badāʾ (the substitution of a new opinion,
something one would like to substitute for the original statement), and subsuming under
only one category badal al-ġalaṭwa-l-nisyān (the permutative of error and forgetfulness, cf.
Wright 1996:ii, 286).

Know, concerning the ʿaṭf al-bayān, that few grammarians know it, that
Sībawayhi mentioned it only incidentally in some sections […], and that
he has not reserved for it any chapter. (wa-ʿlam ʾanna ʿaṭf al-bayān lā
yaʿrifuhu5 kaṯīr min al-naḥwiyyīn wa-ʾinnamā ḏakarahu sībawayhi ʿāriḍan
fī mawāḍiʿ […] wa-lam yufrid lahu bāban, Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī šl i, 236)
A later grammarian, Baṭalyawsī (d. 521/1127), even points out the three features
of ʿaṭf al-bayān which account for its “strangeness among grammarians” (ġarā-
batihā ʿinda al-naḥwiyyīna, Baṭalyawsī Rasāʾil 206): the vocative (nidāʾ), the
vague terms (mubhamāt), that is to say the demonstratives (ʾasmāʾ al-ʾišāra),
and the active participle (ism al-fāʿil).6
By cross-reading the presentations made by traditional Arab grammars, the
ʿaṭf al-bayān represents, in fact, an intersection between ṣifa and badal, with
which it shares some characteristics, but from which it is distinguished by oth-
ers. This is why a grammarian like Baṭalyawsī devotes a study, in his Rasāʾil,
to the difference between naʿt, ʿaṭf bayān and badal (cf. Baṭalyawsī Rasāʾil 195–
226).Assuch,oneof thebestpresentations,althoughnotfreefromcontroversy,
of theʿaṭf al-bayānbetweenṣifaandbadal isthatof IbnYaʿīš(d.643/1245)inhis
commentaryonZamaḫšarī’s(d.538/1144) Mufaṣṣal (cf.IbnYaʿīššm ii,272–274).
However, none of the grammarians (ancient or modern) clearly explains the
distinction that can be made between badal and ʿaṭf bayān, which may help us
to understand the circumspection of ʾAstarābāḏī in the matter.What is import-
ant to bear in mind at this stage is that among the four types of badal, the
ʿaṭf al-bayān would be confused with the badal of the whole for the whole. It
is at least what grammarians say when they indicate that this equivalence is
true under two conditions (yaqūlu al-nuḥāt ʾinna kull mā ṣaluḥa ʾan yakūna ʿaṭf
bayān ǧāza ʾan yakūna badalan bi-šarṭayn, Yaʿqūb 2006: vi, 422, cf. also Howell
1880: i, 481).7
What should also be kept in mind is that the ʿaṭf al-bayān, representing
an intersection between badal and ṣifa, obviously poses problems for gram-
5 The text gives yāʾ-hāʾ-rāʾ-fāʾ that could be read yahrifu “to praise excessively” (cf. Wehr
1994:1026a), but which does not make sense here. It is presumably a typo, hāʾ and ʿayn being
side by side on a keyboard.
6 These considerations being once again only inflectional, and therefore more than suspicious
in a language where the inflection by means of short vowels is not marked (cf. below, fn. 9), I
will not deal with it here.
7 The two conditions in question here are that 1. the tābiʿ can take the place of the matbūʿ and
thus that the operator on the matbūʿ can apply to the tābiʿ and 2. that no semantic impossib-
ility results from the commutation of the two. The first of the two belongs precisely to the
pragmatic criteria discussed by the grammarians (cf. below).

marians to define it precisely. As Esseesy says about the appositives, “the syn-
tacticandsemanticboundariesamongthesesubclasseswerenotalwaysdrawn
sharply […], leading to instances where syntactic ambiguity becomes inevit-
able, as in ḍarabtu ʾabā ʿabdi llāhi zaydan ‘I hit ʾAbū ʿAbd Allāh, Zayd’, which
is bound to be construed either as ʿaṭf bayān ‘explicative coordinating’ or as
badal” (Esseesy 2006: 124–125). Owens specifies indeed that “apparently gram-
marians found it difficult to define it clearly” (Owens 1990: 59).
However, there remains a question which should not be left unanswered,
especially since some grammarians, as we will see, provide an implicit solu-
tion that must be made explicit: how to distinguish between (1) and (2) above?
While Western Arabists do occasionally provide a explanation, albeit rarely,8
our goal must be to focus on the view of the Arab grammarians, since we are
here dealing with the Foundations of Arab Linguistics.
1.2
Traditional Criteria of Distinction between ʿaṭf bayān and badal
Let us first sum up verybriefly thetraditionalcriteriaapplied bythe Arabgram-
marians to distinguish between ʿaṭf bayān and badal.
As for the differences between the two, the fact is that, when consulting
ancient grammarians, there are at least two criteria of distinction between
badalandʿaṭf bayān,thosecriteriabeingwidespreadamongancientgrammari-
ans.Thefirstonepertainstothelinguisticbelief inaconsistentʾiʿrāb,thediffer-
ence made between the two from Mubarrad onwards being linked to inflection
within the framework of the vocative, since he says that the badal is inflec-
ted in the nominative while the ʿaṭf al-bayān is to the accusative (cf. Mubarrad
Muqtaḍab iv, 468 and 475). That is also what Ibn al-Sarrāǧ (d. 316/929) clearly
states:
The difference between the ʿaṭf al-bayān and the badal is that the impli-
cit value (taqdīr) of the ʿaṭf al-bayān is that of the appositive adjective of
the first noun while the implicit value of the badal is to replace the first
[term], and you say in the framework of the vocative when you want to
use the ʿaṭf al-bayān: yā ʾaḫānā zaydan by putting on the accusative with
tanwīnsinceitisnotthevocativeelement,andif youwishtousethebadal

8 This is particularly the case of Larcher who indicates, following the Arab grammarians, that
thebadalrepresentstheessentialtermcomparedtothemubdalminhuwhichistheaccessory
one (cf. Larcher 2017:35). For the details of the treatment of the badal and the ʿaṭf al-bayān
by the Arabists, cf. Sartori 2018a:552–558.

Ibnal-Dahhānal-Baġdādī(d.569/1174)sumsthisupverybrieflyinhiscomment
on ʿaṭf al-bayān: “it is recognized within the vocative explicitly and elsewhere
implicitly” (yuʿrafu fī al-nidāʾ lafẓan wa-fī ġayrihi taqdīran, Ibn al-Dahhān al-
Baġdādī Šarḥ544).
However, these inflections do not appear in written Arabic with its scriptio
defectiva, nor is inflection prominent in conventional pronunciation, where
pausalformspredominate.10Theappealtoinflectionwhichiscommonlymade
by the grammarians therefore has little explanatory value.
The second criterion raised by the grammarians is, in fact, twofold, invoking
two pragmatic features which are discussed by Arab grammarians of all peri-
ods.Thefirstconcernsthebadalandislinkedtothespeaker’sintention:onhim
depends the fact that the badal, because being in a relation of stricto sensu ref-
erential uniqueness with its mubdal minhu, is conceived as the essential term
while the term to which it is apposed is only as an accessory one; the second
concerns the ʿaṭf al-bayān and again points to the speaker’s intention: on him
depends the restriction of the extension of the term to which the ʿaṭf al-bayān
is apposed and, correlatively, the precision of its intension.11 The ʿaṭf al-bayān
is then not an essential term, but rather, as with adjectival qualification gener-
9
He also speaks about it in the context of the vocative (nidāʾ, cf. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl i, 300–
302 and i, 327–328; cf. also ii, 78–79; ii, 116; ii, 134–135). Ibn al-Sarrāǧ indicates that the
categories of badal and ʿaṭf bayān are the terminologies of the so-called grammarians of
Basra (cf. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ ʾUṣūl i, 328).
10
The pausal form is the default ending both in medieval and contemporary Classical
Arabic, to which we may add that the full inflectional system of three cases is not found
with every class of word—many have only two inflections, and others are invariable (e.g.
mūsā, ʿīsā), or the inflections may be masked by suffixes (e.g. kitābī) or obscured by ortho-
graphical ambiguities. Even Qurʾānic Arabic can be seen to be “without desinential inflec-
tion, and that this syntactically irrelevant inflection was introduced for prosodic reasons,
linked to the changing recitation of the Qurʾān (taǧwīd)” (Larcher 2021:37). In effect, overt
inflection is the exception (only in the case of the “six nouns”, cf. Sartori 2010 and Sartori
2018b:69) rather than the rule, and for a language known for inflection, this reduces to
very few cases where it is actually performed!
11
“Intension” and “extension” are borrowed from Logic: “l’extension d’un terme est l’ensem-
ble des référents qu’un terme est susceptibe de dénoter en langue […]. L’intension (ou,
plus traditionnellement, la compréhension) d’un terme correspond aux aspects pertin-
ents de son contenu notionnel qui conditionnent ses emplois référentiels et qui rendent
compte de ses relations avec les autres termes de la langue” (Riegel et al. 2004:179–180).

ally, only an accessory term and, like it, is not in a relation of strictly referential
uniqueness with the term to which it is apposed,12 unlike the badal.
However, there are grammarians whose inquiries go beyond these two cri-
teria, challenging and extending both the distributional/inflectional and the
semantic/pragmatic approach. As I shall show below, they introduce another
criterion, this time of suprasegmental nature, arising from the fusion of the
pragmatic and the syntactic approach…
2
A New Criterion of Suprasegmental Nature
The authors who follow do not abandon the presentation of badal as being the
essential term and its mubdal minhu as the accessory one. Similarly, they still
present the ʿaṭf al-bayān as a generally better-known element, clarifying the
term to which it is associated, by restricting its extension. They even point to
the inflectional criterion to distinguish between the two. However, those gram-
marians add something interesting that transcends the various branches of
indegenous Arabic grammar and is therefore not specific to any one branch. In
this section we introduce a syntactic criterion, that of repetition, resumption,
or independence (i.e. beginning a new sentence), this last having the morpho-
logical consequence that by starting a new sentence a pausal ending appears
on the preceding element.
2.1
Repetition (takrīr, takrār or tašdīd)
2.1.1
Tašdīd
I will begin with the most prevalent criterion among ancient grammarians,
namely that of repetition which one finds in their works in the forms of takrīr,
and more marginally takrār or tašdīd. It is with the latter that I will start this
section since Ibn Ǧinnī begins by defining the badal as “following the course of
the tawkīd in [factual] assertion and doubling” (al-badal yaǧrī maǧrā al-tawkīd
fī al-taḥqīq wa-l-tašdīd, Ibn Ǧinnī Lumaʿ 144), which he is visibly the first to do
so by using the term tašdīd. What needs to be understood here is actually two-
fold: badal and mubdal minhu being in a referential uniqueness relationship, it
thus amounts to saying the same thing twice, both in intention and intension.
That is confirmed by Ibn al-Ḫabbāz (d. 637/1239), commentator of Ibn Ǧin-
nī’s Lumaʿ. Like Ibn Ǧinnī before him, he indicates about the badal that it
12
Suyūṭī (d. 911/1505) even states very clearly that “the explanatory apposition only exists
after a multireferential [noun]” (ʿaṭf al-bayān lā yakūnu ʾillā baʿd muštarak, Suyūṭī ʾAšbāh
iii, 218).

follows the course of the tawkīd in [factual] assertion and doubling (al-taḥqīq
wa-l-tašdīd) and specifies the meaning of tašdīd:
It is because when you say qāma ʾaḫūka zaydun then the badal and the
mubdal minhu are two expressions referring to a single meaning, so it is
like you said qāma ʾaḫūka ʾaḫūka. ( fa-li-ʾannaka ʾiḏā qulta qāma ʾaḫūka
zaydun fa-l-badal wa-l-mubdal minhu ʿābiratāni ʿan maʿnā wāḥid fa-ka-
ʾannaka qulta qāma ʾaḫūka ʾaḫūka, Ibn al-Ḫabbāz Tawǧīh 275)
But this is also equivalent to repeating, qāma ʾaḫūka zaydun amounting to say-
ing qāma ʾaḫūka qāma zaydun, which Bāqūlī (d. 543/1148) and Ibn al-Faḫḫār
(d. 754/1353) will express very clearly (cf. below).
2.1.2
Takrīr
AsforʿAbdal-Qāhiral-Ǧurǧānī(d.471/1078),eventhoughhedoesnotexpressly
address the difference between ʿaṭf bayān and badal, he still has an interesting
observation to make about the latter:
Know that the badal virtually repeats the operator as it was before, so
when you say marartu bi-qawmika ṯulṯayhim then ṯulṯayhim is in the gen-
itive because of the preposition as if you had said bi-ṯulṯayhim […]. The
badal virtually repeats the operator only because the mubdal minhu is
neglected in favor of the badal […] and this is not the case with the
ṣifa since when you say ǧāʾanī zaydun al-ẓarīfu then zayd is not virtu-
ally neglected, but rather both [terms] follow the course of the single
noun. (iʿlam ʾanna al-badal fī ḥukm takrīr al-ʿāmil ka-mā taqaddama fa-
ʾiḏā qulta “marartu bi-qawmika ṯulṯayhim” kāna “ṯulṯayhim” maǧrūran bi-
ḥarf ǧarr ḥattā ka-ʾannaka qulta “bi-ṯulṯayhim” […] wa-ʾinnamā kāna al-

ẓarīfu” lam yakun zaydun fī ḥukm al-matrūk bal kānā ǧāriyayni maǧrā ism
wāḥid, Ǧurǧānī mšī ii, 929)
What Ǧurǧānī adds in contrast to his predecessors is the takrīr element con-
tained in the badal that, if we are to believe ʾUšmūnī (d. 900/1495?) used by
Donat Vernier (1838‒1917; cf. Vernier 1891: ii, 176), the grammarians of the so-
called school of Kufa partly called takrīr. Compared with the takrīr, which vis-
ibly presupposes a pause, he presents the case of the adjective (which we know
the ʿaṭf al-bayān is close to) which, on the contrary, implies a lack of pause, that
is to say a link, which is implied by its comparison with the single noun (ism
wāḥid).

Baṭalyawsī, in the section which he devotes to the difference between naʿt,
badal and ʿaṭf bayān, specifies four of them, the third of which being:
that one supposes with the badal a reiteration of the operator, as if it
belonged to another sentence, whereas one does not suppose that with
the ʿaṭf al-bayān which is on the contrary in this respect like the adject-
ive. (ʾanna al-badal […] yuqaddaru maʿahu ʾiʿādat al-ʿāmil wa-ka-ʾannahu
minǧumlaʾuḫrāwa-ʿaṭf al-bayānlāyuqaddarufīhiḏālikabalhuwafīhāḏā
al-waǧh ka-l-naʿt, Baṭalyawsī Rasāʾil 204)
Thus Baṭalyawsī indicates both the element of repetition contained in the
badal and, as a result, that the latter is then “as if it belonged to another sen-
tence”. By this reference to “another sentence”, this author then indicates very
clearly that the badal is preceded by a pause, which will be later on confirmed
by Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī (cf. below) who replaces ǧumla with his own term
kalām “utterance”.13
Despite what has been said, especially by Talmon, noting that Zamaḫšarī,
like others, was only going by a pragmatic feature (the speaker’s premeditation,
cf.Talmon1981:291),ʾAbūal-Qāsimstilldevotesasectiontotheindependenceof
the badal, an independence which he links to the concept of repetition when
he says:
And what indicates its independent character is that it may be judged as
having its operator repeated. (wa-llaḏī yadullu ʿalā kawnihi mustaqillan
ʾannahu fī ḥukm takrīr al-ʿāmil, Zamaḫšarī Mufaṣṣal 155)
This independent character (mustaqill) of the badal is thus seen to be closely
related to repetition, and therefore implying the existence of a pause that pre-
cedes it.
Bāqūlī, known as Ǧāmiʿ al-ʿUlūm, specifies the same thing speaking also of
“repetition”. He does it a first time for the badal, for which he says that the
operator is repeated and that, implicitly, the badal belongs to another sen-
tence (li-ʾanna al-ʿāmil mukarrar fī al-badal wa-l-badal fī al-taqdīr min ǧumla
ʾuḫrā, Ǧāmiʿ al-ʿUlūm Kitāb Šarḥal-Lumaʿ fī al-naḥw 256). He gives for it as
an example zaydun ḏahaba ʿamrun ʾaḫūhu that he paraphrases zaydun ḏahaba
ʿamrun ḏahaba ʾaḫūhu (cf. Ǧāmiʿ al-ʿUlūm Kitāb Šarḥal-Lumaʿ fī al-naḥw 257).
13
The sentences can indeed be segmented but also linked (or bound) (cf. below fn. 17) as is
the case in subordinated constructions such as yurīduʾanyatakallama “he wants to speak”
whereas the linguistic kalām (which one can render by ‘utterance’ or ‘speech’) “is bounded
by silence” (Carter 2017:151 and cf. 148–149 for possible translations of kalām).

He once again addresses this aspect of repetition at the level of the ʿaṭf al-
bayān,clearlyindicatingthat,unlikethebadal,nosuchrepetitionisfoundwith
ʿaṭf al-bayān:
The ʿaṭf al-bayān resembles the ṣifa in that it is an appositive of the first
[term] and that it clarifies it, except that it is not derived from the verb,
unlike the ṣifa. It resembles the badal in its form, except that it differs
from it because the badal is implicitly in the repetition of the operator,
and that is unlike it [ʿaṭf al-bayān]. This is manifest in the chapter of
the vocative: when you say yā ʾaḫānā zaydan “o our brother Zayd!”, if
you treat zayd as a ʿaṭf bayān, you put the accusative since you make it
replace ʾaḫānā, and if you treat it as a badal, you suppose a repetition of
yā and you say yā ʾaḫānā zaydu “o our brother, Zayd!”, as if you said [yā
ʾaḫānā] yāzaydu. (ʿaṭf al-bayānyušbihual-ṣifafīkawnihitabʿanli-l-ʾawwal

In his great commentary on the Mufaṣṣal Ibn Yaʿīš repeats the elements of
badal by Zamaḫšarī, who, like other grammarians, emphasizes its syntactic
independenceandconnectsitwithrepetition,forwhichIbnYaʿīšthenprovides
crystal clear examples:
When you say marartu bi-ʾaḫīka zaydin, it is implicitly [saying] marartu
bi-ʾaḫīka bi-zaydin, and when you say raʾaytu ʾaḫāka zaydan, its implicit
meaning is raʾaytu ʾaḫāka raʾaytu zaydan. (ʾiḏā qulta “marartu bi-ʾaḫīka

264)
Ibn al-Ḥāǧib (d. 646/1249) also discusses the difference between the two and
likewise connects it to the takrīr: “the badal is considered as the repetition in
all of its cases” (al-badal fī ḥukm al-takrīr fī ǧamīʿ ʾamṯālihi, Ibn al-Ḥāǧib ʾĪḍāḥ
i, 431).
As for the badal, Ibn ʿUṣfūr (d. 669/1271) also notes the feature of repetition
since he says:

When you say qāma zaydun ʾaḫūka […] it is as you said qāma ʾaḫūka hav-
ing retracted what you first said, zayd […] and […] what indicates this
is the repetition of the operator with the badal as in marartu bi-zaydin
bi-ʾaḫīka. Allāh the Almighty said […] (Q. 7/75, cf. below). (ʾiḏā qulta

[…], Ibn ʿUṣfūr šǧ i, 251)
Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī (d. 761/1360), in his Sabīl al-hudā, deals with the two
(cf. Goguyer 1887: 342ff. for the ʿaṭf al-bayān and 358–361 for the badal). He
even addresses the difference between the two (cf. Goguyer 1887: 344–346). He
expressly takes into account only pragmatic and semantic aspects, but still spe-
cifies:
De tout nom dont on peut dire qu’il est adjoint expositif, servant à élu-
cider ou particulariser, on peut dire aussi qu’il est permutatif de tout en
tout, servant à fixer et corroborer le sens, parce qu’il se trouve en effet
comme si le régissant était répété pour lui. À cette règle les uns font
une exception, les autres deux, d’autres même davantage, mais toutes se
trouvent comprises dans l’expression que j’ai employée : « s’il n’est pas
impossible de lui faire remplacer son antécédent. »
goguyer 1887: 345
Further on takrīr, cf. also ʾUšmūnī and Ḫuḍarī (d. 1287/1870) (ʾUšmūnī Manhaǧ
ii, 435 and Ḫuḍarī Ḥāšiya ii, 159).
2.1.3
Takrār
Ibn ʿUṣfūr, but this time in his Muqarrib, deals again with the two types of
appositives (cf. Ibn ʿUṣfūr Muqarrib 321–326 for the badal and 327–328 for the
ʿaṭf al-bayān), and, in the section devoted to the latter, he explains the differ-
encebetweenʿaṭf bayānandbadal,byexpresslyconnectingitwiththecriterion
of takrār al-ʿāmil (repetition of the operator):
The difference between it [ʿaṭf al-bayān] and the badal is that you do not
intend to reject the first [term] with the ʿaṭf al-bayān as you do with the
badal […] because the purpose of the badal is to repeat the operator […]
and that is not allowed in the case of the ʿaṭf al-bayān because no repeti-
tion is intended here. (wa-l-farq baynahu [ʿaṭf al-bayān] wa-bayn al-badal
ʾannakalātanwībi-l-ʾawwalal-ṭarḥfīʿaṭf al-bayānka-mātafʿalufīal-badal

ʿaṭf al-bayān li-ʾannahu laysa fī niyyat takrār al-ʿāmil, Ibn ʿUṣfūr Muqarrib
327)
We find this use of takrār instead of takrīr among others in Ibn al-Faḫḫār, com-
mentator of Zaǧǧāǧī’s (d. 337/949) Ǧumal, who, although he sets out the five
kinds of appositives, does not deal with the ʿaṭf al-bayān (cf. Ibn al-Faḫḫār šǧ
and Ibn al-Faḫḫār šǧ(2)). As for the badal, he immediately indicates in the
definition the aspect of repetition:
The badal is the appositive whose implicit value is the repetition of the
operator, so, when you say qāma zaydun ʾaḫūka it has the implicit value
of qāma zaydun qāma ʾaḫūka. (al-badal huwa al-tābiʿ ʿalā taqdīr takrār al-
ʿāmil fa-ʾiḏā qulta “qāma zaydun ʾaḫūka” fa-ʾinnahu fī taqdīr “qāma zaydun
qāma ʾaḫūka”, Ibn al-Faḫḫār šǧ i, 190)
Ibn ʿAqīl finally (d. 769/1367) states that substitution (badal) occurs in the
intentionof repeatingtheoperator(al-badalʿalāniyyattakrāral-ʿāmil,IbnʿAqīl
ša ii, 59).
One last element to note is that this dimension is not totally ignored among
Arabists.Wright (1830–1889), for example, for whom ʿaṭf bayān can be regarded
asfunctionnonginasimilarwaytotheadjectivalqualifier,ṣifa,“Thisapposition
is equivalent to the use of wa-huwa, wa-hiya, etc. (e.g. ǧāʾanī ʾaḫūka wa-huwa
zaydun)” (Wright 1996: ii, 287), which is basically approaching the solution by
making of it a link of concomitant nature to be distinguished from the badal
where there is a new start and therefore a break.
2.2
Resumption (istiʾnāf) and Independence (istiqlāl)
Regarding the distinction between badal and ʿaṭf bayān, the other distinguish-
ing criterion that one can identify from reading the ancient grammarians,
though it is less prominent than takrīr, is that of istiʾnāf, that is to say resump-
tion14 as well as that of istiqlāl, that is to say independence.
14
For this term in Farrāʾ (d. 207/822), cf. Kasher 2014 and also Larcher 2013:195, but also Kin-
berg 1996: 28–32 and notably his definition of istʾanafa: “to begin (a new unit which is:
1. Separated in pronunciation from the preceding unit…)” (1996:29) as well as the state-
ment of Farrāʾ: wa-qawluhu“wa-māʾarsalnāminrasūlinʾillābi-lisāniqawmihili-yubayyina
lahum” […] ṯumma qāla ʿazza wa-ǧalla “fa-yuḍillu -llāhu man yašāʾu” fa-rufiʿa li-ʾanna al-
niyya fīhi al-istiʾnāf lā al-ʿaṭf ʿalā ma qablahu (1996:30) where, here at least, Farrāʾ clearly
contrasts ʿaṭf with istiʾnāf. In this paper, therefore, resumption will denote a new start,
implying a pause before it.

I will start with Ibn Ǧinnī, who, when he writes about the ʿaṭf al-bayān “You
sayqāmaʾaḫūkamuḥammadunasyousayqāmaʾaḫūkaal-ẓarīfu”(taqūlu“qāma
ʾaḫūka muḥammadun” ka-qawlika “qāma ʾaḫūka al-ẓarīfu”, Ibn Ǧinnī Lumaʿ
148), significantly chooses the formulation ka-qawlika “as if you were saying”.
Could this be the trace of the fact that the apposed element and its ʿaṭf bayān
must be pronounced as one does in the case of a mawṣūf and its ṣifa, that is
to say in one breath, as a single noun (ism wāḥid, cf. ʿAbd al-Qāhir al-Ǧurǧānī
above)? Such an idea cannot be ruled out, in view of the importance of the
word as here,15 especially in the light of what follows.
The first among the grammarians to be perfectly explicit on this subject is,
it seems, Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī who precisely links takrīr and istiʾnāf. About
the badal he says indeed immediately this: “the badal is one of the appositives
except that it has originally the implicit value of two sentences: when you say
ḍarabtu zaydan raʾsahu the base is ḍarabtu zaydan ḍarabtu raʾsahu” (al-badal
ʾaḥadal-tawābiʿʾillāʾannahufītaqdīrǧumlataynfīal-ʾaṣlʾiḏāqulta“ḍarabtuzay-
danraʾsahu”fa-l-ʾaṣl“ḍarabtuzaydanḍarabturaʾsahu”,IbnBarhānal-ʿUkbarī šl
i, 229). But further on, this time about the ʿaṭf al-bayān, he says:
If you ask: why did you not treat this section of the appositives as a badal,
we will say that the adjectival qualifier is directly joined in the utterance
to the qualified element, that it is not considered as a new utterance and
that the same is true of the situation of the ʿaṭf al-bayān. Also, when you
say qāma hāḏā zaydun “this one Zayd got up” by constructing the utter-
ance on the mention of zayd16 and not disassociating it from hāḏā, it is
a ʿaṭf al-bayān. If you make of it [utterance] a new one, as if you said
qāma hāḏā qāma zaydun “this one got up, Zayd got up”, it is then a badal.

hān al-ʿUkbarī šl i, 235)
15
It has the same importance elsewhere, notably for Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) when
he says that we must treat social facts as things (cf. Durkheim 1988:77 and 120; Pouillon
1987:112 for French and Durkheim 1982:35 and 69 for English).
16
That is, with the intention of saying zayd.

suprasegmental criteria in medieval arabic grammar
211
Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī could not be clearer, his recourse to muttaṣil on the
one hand, to mustaʾnaf and munqaṭiʿ on the other hand, the first referring to
ʿaṭf al-bayān and the second to badal, leaving no doubt about his concept of
the difference between these two types of appositions: in addition to the tra-
ditional criteria already mentioned,17 he adds one, suprasegmental in nature,
which takes into account pronunciation in juncture or segmentation!18 This
confirms, in my opinion, the reading of Ibn Ǧinnī’s as, that is to say that an ism
and its ṣifa are said in one breath.
This criterion of resumption, in the express form of istiʾnāf, is then found
in particular in Ibn ʿUṣfūr who, in the section devoted to the badal, writes:
“the badal is in the intention of a resumption of an operator, and when you
say qāma zaydun ʾaḫūka the implicit value is that of qāma ʾaḫūka” (al-badal fī
niyyatistiʾnāf ʿāmilfa-ʾiḏāqulta“qāmazaydunʾaḫūka”fa-l-taqdīr“qāmaʾaḫūka”,
Ibn ʿUṣfūr Muqarrib 321). What must be understood here, as elsewhere, is thus
that qāma zaydun ʾaḫūka is equivalent to qāma zaydun qāma ʾaḫūka (cf. above,
Bāqūlī and Ibn al-Faḫḫār).
This element of resumption (istiʾnāf ), linked to that of repetition (takrīr),
implies the recognition of a pause, exemplified by the existence of “two sen-
tences”, which Ibn al-Dahhān al-Baġdādī expresses very well when, as before
him Bāqūlī, he clearly indicates that badal and ʿaṭf bayān contrast with each
other in the feature of repetition, where again the “two sentences” are men-
tioned:
Know that the badal and the element to which it is apposed are implicitly
in two sentences, which is not the case of the qualifier and the quali-
fied element (ṣifa and mawṣūf ), nor of the corroborative and the cor-
roborated element, nor of the ʿaṭf al-bayān and what precedes it. What
confirms this to you is that the operator on the second element appears
overtly in the words of the Almighty qāla l-malaʾu llaḏīna -stakbarū min
17
Note that he does not reject the traditional views, and nothing prevents him from con-
trasting the two structures purely in terms of their inflection: “yā hāḏā zaydun do you not
see that the tanwīn of zaydun indicates that it is not a badal and against that you say yā
ʾayyuhā al-raǧulu zaydu where zaydu is a badal of ʾayy and for that is indeclinable in u
without bearing any tanwīn?” (yā hāḏā zaydun ʾa-lā tarā ʾanna tanwīn zaydun qad dalla
ʿalā ʾannahu laysa bi-badal wa-ʿalā hāḏā taqūlu yā ʾayyuhā al-raǧulu zaydu fa-zaydu […]
yakūnu badalan min ʾayyu fa-li-ḏālika kāna mabniyyan ʿalā al-ḍamm ġayr munawwan, Ibn
Barhān al-ʿUkbarī šl i, 236).
18
This distinction is taken from the Swiss linguist Charles Bally (1865–1947) (cf. Bally 1965)
and, for grammar and linguistics of Arabic, from Larcher (cf. especially Larcher 2008 and
Larcher 2017).

Council of those of his people who waxed proud to those that were
abased, to those of them who believed” (Arberry 1955: 180).19 The overt
expression of the lām indicates the correctness of our position. (iʿlam

ḏahabnā ʾilayhi, Ibn al-Dahhān al-Baġdādī Ġurra ii, 817)
He then has a contrastive definition that is very interesting:
Know that the purpose of the appositive is either to [syntactically] com-
plete the antecedent or not. The one that does not complete the first is
the element coordinated by a coordinating particle. The one that com-
pletes the first is either in the implicit value of two sentences or in that of
a single sentence. The one that is in the implicit value of two sentences
is the badal […] and the one that is in the implicit value of a single sen-
tence is of two types […] the first is the tawkīd and the second is the ʿaṭf
al-bayān. (iʿlam ʾanna al-tābiʿ ʾimmā ʾan yakūna mukammilan li-l-ʾawwal

We find here, once again through the mention of “two sentences” (badal), as
opposed to “single sentence” (ʿaṭf bayān), the element of repetition, therefore
of pause…This referenceto“twosentences”isfoundlater,explicitlyinʾUšmūnī

213
This resumption is then linked to the independence of the badal from the
mubdal minhu, unlike the relationship of dependence that exists between the
ʿaṭf al-bayān and its maʿṭūf. On these, I already indicated that they were obvi-
ously to be considered as a single noun (ism wāḥid, cf. above ʿAbd al-Qāhir
al-Ǧurǧānī) and as muttaṣil (cf. above Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī). As for the inde-
pendent relationship, it is apparently Ibn Mālik (d. 672/1274) who speaks of it
first. Indeed, he writes concerning the badal that it is “like an independent ele-
ment” (ka-mustaqill, Ibn Mālik škš i, 579). Elsewhere, he further specifies that
the badal is “the independent appositive because of the virtual requirement
of the operator” (al-tābiʿ al-mustaqill bi-muqtaḍā al-ʿāmil taqdīran, Ibn Mālik
Tashīl 172), which he says also in his own commentary on this book (cf. Ibn
Mālik št iii, 186–188 for the ʿaṭf al-bayān and iii, 189–201 for the badal).
It is, however, Ibn ʿAqīl who seems to be the first to link the maṣdar istiqlāl
to the badal, writing about ʿaṭf al-bayān that it is: “the non-derived appositive
similar to the qualifier in clarifying its antecedent and in its lack of [syntactic]
independence” (al-tābiʿ al-ǧāmid al-mušbih li-l-ṣifa fī ʾīḍāḥmatbūʿihi wa-ʿadam
istiqlālihi, Ibn ʿAqīl ša ii, 57) where he addresses both the aspect of restriction
of the extension (through ʾīḍāḥ) and where the non-independence that the ʿaṭf
al-bayān shares with the qualifier contrasts indeed with the badal which, in
turn, is conceived as independent.20
Finally, ʾAstarābāḏī, surprisingly, says he does not understand the difference
between the total badal and the ʿaṭf al-bayān. This said, he, however, recog-
nizes in the badal its resumptive quality, though without using the term, since
he gives two examples going in this direction.The first is taken from the Qurʾān
and shows the badal intervening after a fāṣila, that is to say in the verse fol-
lowing the one in which the mubdal minhu is located: wa-ʾinnaka la-tahdī ʾilā
ṣirāṭinmustaqīmin/ṣirāṭil-llāhi,Q.42/52–53,“Andthou,surelythoushaltguide
unto a straight path—the path of God” (Arberry 1955: 198).21
The second is equally clear: “marartu bi-qawmin ʿabdi llāhi wa-zaydin wa-
ḫālidin and the nominative is good, that is to say ‘these are ʿAbd Allāh, Zayd and
Ḫālid’” (marartu bi-qawmin ʿabdi llāhi wa-zaydin wa-ḫālidin wa-l-rafʿ ǧayyid ʾay
hum ʿabdu llāhi wa-zaydun wa-ḫālidun, ʾAstarābāḏī šk ii, 397). Thus ʾAstarā-
bāḏī indicates here that the badal can follow the inflection of the mubdal
minhu, but that it can also be in nominative by implying making a new start,
which is neither more nor less than a resumption, which nowadays would be
shown by the punctuation, as follows: “I went through a group of men: ʿAbd

Allāh, Zayd and Ḫālid” where the colon serves to indicate a (strong) segmenta-
tion and therefore a pause.

Segmentation vs Juncture
So we see that many medieval Arab grammarians, when it comes to dealing
with the badal, address the issue of takrīr (marginally takrār or tašdīd), in con-
nection with istiʾnāf and istiqlāl. The takrīr we are talking about is syntactic,
non-morphological, and not unknown to Sībawayhi himself, since we find it
twice in the Kitāb (Derenbourg’s edition in i, 433 l. 11 and ii, 152 l. 2, cf.Troupeau
1976: 182). More interestingly, one of the two occurrences of takrīr in the Kitāb
is specifically related to the badal:
You say marartu bi-zaydin ibni ʿamrin when you do not make of al-ibn
a qualification but you make of it a badal or a takrīr like ʾaǧmaʿīna.
(wa-taqūlu “marartu bi-zaydin ibni ʿamrin” ʾiḏā lam taǧʿal “al-ibn” waṣ-
fan wa-lākinnaka taǧʿaluhu badalan ʾaw takrīran ka-ʾaǧmaʿīna, Sībawayhi
Kitāb(2) ii, 152 l. 2 = Sībawayhi Kitāb iii, 566)
In the same way, it is interesting to note that of the three mentions in the Kitāb
of theverbistaʾnafainasyntacticalmeaning(cf.Troupeau1976:35),oneisonce
more directly related to our topic. Indeed, at the very place of the single occur-
rence of the term ʿaṭf al-bayān in his Kitāb, Sībawayhi presents something that
will, with rare exceptions as we have seen, be forgotten over time, and this ele-
ment is in fact of suprasegmental nature: it is neither more nor less than the
taking into account of a pause, marked by the istiʾnāf. Making the difference
between the ʿaṭf al-bayān and something that is not categorized at this point
in the text as badal, Sībawayhi writes:
As for what Ruʾba says, it is the fact that he made of naṣran a ʿaṭf al-
bayān and he put it in the accusative as if he had said yā zaydu zaydan.
As to what ʾAbū ʿAmr says, it is as if he had started the vocative again
[i.e. yā zaydu yā zaydu l-ṭawīlu]. (wa-ʾammā qawl ruʾba fa-ʿalā ʾannahu
ǧaʿala“naṣran”ʿaṭf al-bayānwa-naṣabahuka-ʾannahuʿalāqawlihi“yāzay-
dun zaydan” wa-ʾammā qawl ʾabī ʿamr fa-ka-ʾannahu istaʾnafa al-nidāʾ,
Sībawayhi Kitāb ii, 187)
Nevertheless, the author of the Kitāb indicates for one case that it can be a
badal or a ʿaṭf bayān, which shows that he does not really have the idea of

the segmentation by istiʾnāf… (cf. Sībawayhi Kitāb ii, 191).22 This correlation
is, however, quite relevant, as Larcher recalls it:
Especially remarkable is the case of “disjunction” called “resumption”
(istiʾnāf ), because the second clause is to be understood as a response
( jawāb) to an implicit question (suʾāl) suggested by the first, as in the fol-
lowing verse: qāla lī kayfa ʾanta qultu ʿalīlū/saharun dāʾimun wa-ḥuznun
ṭawīlū (“‘How are you?’ he asked me. ‘Unwell! Permanent insomnia and
prolonged melancholy!’ I replied”); saharun dāʾimun wa-ḥuznu ṭawīlū re-
sponds in fact to a question like mābālukaʿalīlan (“What maladies do you
have?”) or else mā sababu ʿillatika (“What is the cause of your malady?”).
We see, from these few examples, that if “conjunction” is defined as a syn-
tactic coordination, then “disjunction” could be interpreted as a semantic
coordination, in the sense of Bally (1965): the two disjoint clauses are in
the semantic relation of topic to comment and the comment implicitly
makes reference to the topic: “He is dead (and, because he is dead,) may
Allah take pity on him!”; “(They say that they do nothing but mock, but)
it is Allah who mocks them; [I am] sick; (you are going to ask me from
what): from permanent insomnia and prolonged melancholy.”
larcher 2013: 195
The term “response” indeed implies that of “discourse’s resumption” and there-
fore of segmentation. On the contrary, in the case of the ʿaṭf al-bayān, the
juncture seems so strong thatTalmon notes among the distinctions to be made
between ṣifa and ʿaṭf (and thus ʿaṭf al-bayān) that the ṣifa can follow an impli-
cit ʾaʿnī (“I mean”), which is impossible in the case of the ʿaṭf (cf. Talmon 1981:
287, fn. 14).23

Conclusion
In his Syntaxe de l’arabe classique, Pierre Larcher indicates that “the one thing
missing element from traditional Arabic grammar is intonation” (Larcher 2017:
97).24 We have just seen that this is true concerning the difference between

ʿaṭf bayān and badal al-kull min al-kull, where the main element taken into
account is of pragmatic nature. However, as I have just shown, the supraseg-
mental aspect can still be identified, and join a dichotomy which, once we have
it in mind, we can no longer leave out of account: the distinction between seg-
mentation and juncture.
If a grammarian and logician like ʾAstarābāḏī is doubtful about the distinc-
tion between badal al-kull and ʿaṭf bayān, it is because at the written level,
a fortiori at a time when punctuation did not exist, both can only be distin-
guished orally, and this is the strength of Ibn Barhān al-ʿUkbarī who was the
firsttogobeyondaliteraryanalysisandfranklyintegratestherhythmof speech
in his reflexion.
But make no mistake, in the perspective of the Arabic grammatical tradi-
tion, as elsewhere, this suprasegmental criterion is in fact conditioned by the
semantic and pragmatic criterion and is therefore secondary to it: as for the
badal, it is because there is a referential uniqueness which makes the tābiʿ the
primary element (semantic and pragmatic criterion) that there is takrīr, there-
fore istiʾnāf, that is to say pause and therefore segmentation (suprasegmental
criterion); as for the ʿaṭf al-bayān, it is because there is a referential multiplicity
(semantic and pragmatic criterion) that matbūʿ and tābiʿ are considered as a
single noun (ism wāḥid) and as linked (muttaṣil) and that therefore no pause
is made possible between the two, indicating then a juncture (suprasegmental
criterion). This second criterion would, therefore, come (the addressee ignor-
ing for example whether what is referred to is unique or multiple) to highlight
objectively the semantic and pragmatic criterion which remains only subject-
ive.
Without giving into precursorism, we still have to note that the description
made by these medieval Arab grammarians can indeed match what contem-
porary linguists of French25 say when they distinguish between close appos-
ition (apposition liée) and loose apposition (apposition détachée). Indeed, in
French grammar, among expansions of the noun (also called its modifiers)
including the attributive adjective, the construct state, etc., Riegel et al. indic-
ate that they “have with the noun two types of relationships” (Riegel et al. 2004:
179,26 also cf. 150) depending on whether these modifiers do restrict or not
the extension of the noun. The first category includes the attributive adjective
and among the second ones, which they generically call appositives “because
non-restrictive modifiers are often separated from the rest of the utterance by
25
Being French, the author of these lines naturaly refers to French grammar and linguistics.

“entretiennent avec le nom deux types de relations”.

intonation or by a pause, and in standard writing by a comma” (Riegel et al.
2004: 150).27 These modifiers are then said to be “in detached position” (en
position détachée, cf. Neveu 1998 and Caddéo 2000), a position that is “mani-
fested in writing by the frame between two commas and orally by pauses (and
sometimes by a ‘bracketed’ melody)” (Riegel et al. 2004: 190).28 In the second
category, the authors note that the appositive and its antecedent are in a rela-
tionshipof referentialuniqueness,whichtheyillustratewiththeexample Paris,
lacapitaledelaFrance,where“itisundeniablethatthetwodefinedexpressions
refer to the same reality” (Riegel et al. 2004: 19029).30
Even if, in French (or other languages like English or Swedish for example),
things are not so clear-cut (cf. Rioul 1983, Lindqvist 2013 and Lindqvist 2015),
we will recognize in the non-restrictive modifiers the description of the Arabic
badal al-kull min al-kull, not only because of its explicit description by the
medieval grammarians who make it an element in a relationship of referen-
tial uniqueness with the term to which it is apposed, but also because of their
use of takrīr and istiʾnāf which effectively imply their separation from the term
to which they are apposed through starting again and the associated pause.
We will then recognize in the first category, that of restrictive modifiers,
those features which ʿaṭf al-bayān shares with the ṣifa, that is to say the adject-
ive, namely its function of restricting the extension of the noun, the ʿaṭf al-
bayān being the most often described as ʾaḫaṣṣmin al-ʾawwal, as ʾašhar al-
27
“parce que les modificateurs non restrictifs sont souvent séparés du reste de l’énoncé par
l’intonation ou par une pause, et dans l’écrit standard par une virgule”.
28
“matérialisée à l’écrit par l’encadrement entre deux virgules et à l’oral par des pauses (et
parfois par une mélodie “parenthétique”)”. We can add here an example from Yusuf Idris
in his short story Riḥla where he writes kay ʾuḥissa ʾannī […] wa-ʾannī ʾašʿuru bi-l-ʾamān,
ʾaḥlā wa-ʾaʿḏab wa-ʾamtaʿ ʾamān “so that I feel […] that I know the peace, the most beauti-
ful, pleasant and delightful peace”. Here, the presence of a comma is the manifestation in
the written expression of the pause between the mubdal minhu and the badal.
29
“il est indéniable que les deux expressions définies désignent la même réalité”.
30
Paradigmatically, it is a matter of distinguishing 1) at the G20 summit, President Biden and
President Macron met… where “President”, in an international context, is a multiple refer-
ent from 2) during his trip to the Lot (French area), the President, Macron, declared… where
“President”, in a national context, is a unique referent. It could also explain what Mejdell
points out when dealing with the pronunciation of demonstratives without juncture.
According to her, pronunciations like hāḏihi ʾal-madīna, that is to say without the elision
of “the hamzat al-waṣl of the article on the head noun following” (Mejdell 2006:212–213),
would reflect “the search for the right expression, lebonmot to be the head noun” (Mejdell
2006:221). This said, this nonjuncture could also make of the head noun a badal, then to
be read as this, the town for example. I wish here to warmly thank Michael G. Carter for
this reference as well as for his reading of this article, drastically approving its English, and
also to our colleague, Emilie Coulon.

ismayn (cf. Ǧurǧānī šǧ 277, Zamaḫšarī ʾUnmūḏaǧ 20), and ʾaʿraf minhu (cf.
Ǧurǧānī šǧ 277), but which also shares with the ṣifa the feature of not being
orally separated from the term to which it is apposed.
In grammatical traditions like the French one for instance, this recognition
of the double status of the apposition as either close or loose only manifests
itself during 16th century (cf. Neveu 1998: 20). So here, again without giving in
to precursorism, we have, in Arabic grammar, the early trace of a distinction
between these two types of apposition, according to the same semantic and
pragmatic criteria and with therefore the same suprasegmental consequences.

On Interpretation of the Pronoun huwa in 112/1
of the Qurʾān: Tafsīr and Grammar
Haruko Sakaedani
Introduction
The pronoun huwa in qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥad allāhu l-ṣamad (Q. 112/1) is often
interpreted as a topic, allāh its comment, and ʾaḥad1 its apposition or the
second comment, as shown below2 :
Sahih International
“Say, ‘He is Allah, [who is] One,’”
Muhsin Khan
“Say (O Muhammad (Peace be upon him)): ‘He is Allah,
(the) One.”
Pickthall
“Say: He is Allah, the One!”
Yusuf Ali
“Say: He is Allah, the One and Only”
Shakir
“Say: He, Allah, is One”
Dr. Ghali
“Say, ‘He is Allah, The Only One,”.
As for John A. Arberry (1905–1969; Arberry 1955: 361), he translates this verse
as “Say: ‘He is God, One,”. This paper examines the proposition that huwa is a
pronoun of the matter (ḍamīr al-šaʾn), as evidenced by descriptions in tafsīr-s
and grammar books.

The Pronoun of the Matter (ḍamīr al-šaʾn)
The pronoun of the matter (ḍamīr al-šaʾn) is a kind of cataphoric pronoun that
refers to the sentence that follows the pronoun.
1 On the meaning of ʾaḥad as “anyone”, while wāḥid is “one, unique”, and as a possible foreign
word of Hebrew origin, e(ḥ)ḥād, cf. Dye 2017:343–344.
2 https://legacy.quran.com/112 (accessed on September 13, 2018). Shakir’s translation regards
Allāh (allāhu) as an apposition of He (huwa). Refer to the interpretation of Bāqūlī/Zaǧǧāǧ
ʾIʿrāb (ii, 564) described in the beginning of §4.

chapter 10
AccordingtoBadawi&AbdelHaleem(2008:994),attheentryof huwa,huwa
of Q. 112/1 is referred as pronoun of the fact (ḍamīr al-šaʾn) or pronoun of the
story (pronoun that anticipates a whole subsequent clause) (ḍamīr al-qiṣṣa)
and is translated as ‘the fact is…’, and ‘the situation is…’. ‘The fact of the matter
is: God is One’ is shown as an interpretation of the verse huwa llāhu ʾaḥad.
Ziyādī (2006: 237) stated that ḍamīr al-šaʾn is characterized by its ambiguity
(that is, its referent does not precede it), its clarity in the sentence that follows
it (al-ʾamr), and its emphasis of the matter (al-šaʾn). He also states that ḍamīr
al-šaʾn in the Qurʾān is divided into three categories: independent pronouns,
suffix pronouns, and omitted (maḥḏūf ) pronouns, and that examples of ḍamīr
al-šaʾn in independent forms without ‘sudden ʾiḏā’ (ʾiḏā al-fuǧāʾiyya)3 can be
found in Q. 18/38, Q. 34/27,4 and Q. 112/1 (Ziyādī 2006: 243).
As for Modern Arabic, Bloch (1990) and Badawi et al. (2004; 2016) describe
ḍamīr al-šaʾn limiting it to suffixed pronouns attached to ʾinna etc., as inde-
pendent pronouns are scarcely used as ḍamīr al-šaʾn in Modern Arabic.5
Bloch (1990) claims that ḍamīr al-šaʾn is not a referential pronoun, but a
‘dummy’ pronoun that has no content or referentiality, that is, that such pro-
nouns are used after ʾinna and its sisters (ʾinna wa-ʾaḫawātuhā) to keep the
verb-subject word order, as in: ʾannahu laysat tuġannī ḥamāmatun (“that no
dove cooed”), which cannot be a correct or sound clause without the pro-
noun -hu: *ʾanna laysat tuġannī ḥamāmatun. In his opinion, huwa in the verse
(Q. 112/1) must not be confused with ḍamīr al-šaʾn; it is another kind of pro-
3 There are a total of 12 examples of ḍamīr al-šaʾn with ‘sudden ʾiḏā’ given by Ziyādī (2006),
that is, Q. 7/107, 108, 117, 16/4, 20/20 (Ziyādī writes 20/19), 21/18, 97, 26/32, 33, 45 (Ziyādī writes
40), 36/77 (Ziyādī writes 36/57), and 67/16, but in eight of them (Q. 7/107, 108, 16/4, 20/20,
21/18, 26/32, 33, and 36/77), the pronouns (huwa and hiya) are followed only by indefinite
noun phrases, as can be seen in the following examples: fa-ʾalqā ʿaṣāhu fa-ʾiḏā hiya ṯuʿbānun
mubīnun (Q. 7/107, “So he threw his staff, and suddenly it was a serpent, manifest”); fa-nazaʿa
yadahufa-ʾiḏāhiyabayḍāʾuli-l-nāẓirīna(Q.7/108,“Andhedrewouthishand;thereuponitwas
white for the observers”). I question the inclusion of such pronouns in ḍamīr al-šaʾn, which
introduces a sentence. Regarding Q. 7/117, 26/45, and 67/16, the pronoun hiya is followed by a
verb or a verb and its object. Since the expression fa-ʾiḏā must be followed by a nominal sen-
tence, it is inevitable that the anaphoric pronoun hiya is used just after fa-ʾiḏā in these verses.
With regard to Q. 21/97: […] fa-ʾiḏā hiya šāḫiṣatun ʾabṣāru allaḏīna kafarū “[…] then suddenly
the eyes of those who disbelieved will be staring”, the pronoun hiya is followed by a complete
nominal sentence in which a comment precedes its topic. Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī (d. 761/1360)
uses such a pronoun, hiya, in this verse as an example of ḍamīr al-šaʾn in his Muġnī al-labīb
(ii, 103). We have avoided an in-depth discussion of this issue here. (The translations of the
verses are from Sahih International.)
4 For these two verses, cf. infra §5.
5 According to Ziyādī (2006), pronouns of the fact (ḍamīr al-šaʾn) in suffix pronoun form fol-
lowing ʾinna and ʾanna occur thirty times in the Qurʾān.

on interpretation of the pronoun huwa in 112/1 of the qurʾān
225
noun with an obscure function. Bloch (1990: 34) also regards the pronoun
-nī6 as ḍamīr al-šaʾn, because its usage is parallel to -hu, which is ḍamīr al-
šaʾn:7
a. yā Mūsā innahu anā llāhu l-ʿazīzu l-ḥakīmu
“Moses, I am God, the All-mighty, All-wise”
Q 27: 9
b. yā Mūsā innī anā rabbuka fa-ḫlaʿ naʿlayka
“Moses, I am your Lord; put off your shoes”
Q 20: 12
c. innanī anā llāhu lā ilāha illā anā
“I am God, there is no God but I”
Q 20: 14
d. yā Mūsā ʾinnī anā llāhu rabbu l-ʿālamīn
“Moses, I am God, the Lord of all being”
Q 28: 30
On the other hand, Badawi et al. (2004: 337; 2016: 382) call ḍamīr al-šaʾn an
anticipatory pronoun, and state that after the sentence modifiers ʾinna, ʾanna,
etc. (that is, ʾinna and its sisters), a default -hu8 (masculine singular, but rarely
feminine -hā) must be used when the modifier is followed by a verbal sen-
tence, and that this -hu is an anticipatory pronoun representing the sentence
to come.
William Wright (1830–1889; Wright 1955) also describes ḍamīr al-šaʾn, limit-
ing it to suffixed pronouns attached to ʾinna, among others. In his discussion
of ʾinna and ʾanna, Wright (1955: respectively i, 285 and i, 293) also states that
the pronoun -hu often represents and anticipates a subsequent clause. He calls
it ḍamīr al-šaʾn or ḍamīr al-qiṣṣa and states that it is masculine or feminine
according to the gender of the subject in the following sentence. He gives the
following verse as an example of the feminine (ii, 299): fa-ʾinnahā lā taʿmā al-
ʾabṣāru (Q. 22/46,9 “For it is not the eyes that become blind”).
Based on Ǧurǧānī (d. 471/1078; Muqtaṣid i, 421) and Zamaḫšarī (d. 538/1144;
Ibn Yaʿīš šm iii, 114), Peled (2009: 212–213) summarised the basic constructions
of ḍamīr al-šaʾn as follows:
6 In a precise sense, -n- is nūn al-wiqāya (nūn of protection), so the pronoun is only -ī.
7 He refuses to state that the pronoun -nī is a subject and ʾanā is its emphasis in Q. 20/11–12
(yā mūsā ʾinnī ʾanā rabbuka “Oh, Musa, I am your lord”), Q. 20/14, and Q. 28/30, claiming that
these contexts do not suggest contrastiveness like ‘I alone am God’.
8 Badawi et al. (2004:338; 2016: 383) also refer to the unusual occurrence of a feminine pronoun
-hā. It can be considered that -hā occurs by attraction to the subject of the verbal sentence
when it is a grammatically feminine singular, or sometimes it may be simply cataphoric.
9 Wright writes Q. 22/45, according to Flügel’s version.

As for huwa in huwa llāhu ʾaḥadun (Q. 112/1), Peled (2009:214) insists that the
analysis of huwa in this case, as ḍamīr al-šaʾn, was not universally accepted.
Peled (1990: 5) regards huwa in Q. 112/1 as non-referential. He shows three
major types of syntactic interpretations of Q. 112/1, as follows:

Peled (1990: 6) rejects these three because (A) does not explain the function of
huwa,10 as the indefinite noun (ʾaḥadun) in (B) is regarded as an apposition of
the definite noun (allāhu), and because the term ḫabar ṯānin in (C) does not
specify the topic; furthermore, the relationship between the two comments is
unclear.
He also rejects the following analysis as it is unsuitable in this context (Peled
1990: 6, fn. 7):

head

huwa
allāhu
ʾaḥadun
Peled (1990: 14) presents the analysis (D) that accounts for the function ḫabar
ṯānin assigned to ʾaḥadun:
primary clause
(D)
pro-topic
comment
huwa
allāhu

He claims that huwa is a pro-topic, a non-referential pronoun that cannot be
replaced by a referential nominal, and its function is to fill the topic slot in the

Peled (1990) also insists that the exponent for non-referential pronoun consists of one
word rather than a full clause.

Peled (1990) writes respectively “subject” and “predicate”.

primary clause so as to create a comment position readily available for allāhu;
because of this, huwa and allāhu can function as full topics in the second-
ary clause, and that allāhu shows new information in the primary clause and
ʾaḥadun shows new information in the secondary clause (Peled 1990: 14–15).
1.2
Naming the Pronoun of the Matter (ḍamīr al-šaʾn)
Ziyādī (2006) mentions, as names of the pronoun of the matter, names other
than ḍamīr al-šaʾn such as ḍamīr al-maǧhūl, ḍamīr al-ʾamr, ḍamīr al-ḥadīṯ,
ḍamīr al-qiṣṣa, ḍamīr al-ʿimād, and ḍamīr al-ḥāla. According to him, three
of these names—al-šaʾn (matter), al-ḥadīṯ(speech), and al-qiṣṣa (story)—
are terms of the Basra school of grammarians. On the other hand, al-maǧhūl
(unknown) is a Kufan term. This description almost concurs with that of Ibn
Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī, who states that ḍamīr al-šaʾn and ḍamīr al-qiṣṣa are called
ḍamīr al-maǧhūl by the Kufan grammarians (cf. Muġnī ii, 103).
Wright, however, regards ḍamīr al-maǧhūl as a name of a pronoun -hu fol-
lowing rubba (“many a…”) because the noun to which it relates has not previ-
ously been mentioned: wa-rubbahu ʿaṭiban ʾanqaḏta min ʿaṭabih12 (“and many
a perishing (man) hast thou saved from destruction” (Wright 1955: ii, 214).
Peled (2006: 558) points out that grammarians present the pronoun -hu in
rubbahuraǧulan ‘many a man’. Zamaḫšarī describes this pronoun as indefinite,
vague, and non-referential (yurmā bihi min ġayri qaṣdin ʾilā muḍmarin lahu ‘it
is thrown without aim at anything kept for it’) (Ibn Yaʿīš šm iii, 118), and that,
though this is similar to ḍamīr al-šaʾn, as both of them require tafsīr (expo-
nent), Ibn Yaʿīš explains the difference between them as that ḍamīr al-šaʾn is
expounded by a sentence while the pronoun attached to rubba is expounded
by a single word (šm iii, 118).
Wright uses the term ḍamīr al-ʿimād, which serves as a prop or support to
the sentence, with a similar meaning to ḍamīr al-faṣl (the pronoun of separa-
tion, that is, the pronoun that separates the topic mubtadaʾ and the comment
ḫabar, cf. Wright 1955: ii, 259). According to Peled (2006: 557), some grammari-
ans regarded ʾiyyā as ʿimād, a prop word for the pronoun attached to it.
ʿAbābnih (2006: 30–31) summarizes transitions of the terms. As for ʿimād,
Basran grammarians like Ibn al-Sarrāǧ (d. 316/929), Zaǧǧāǧ (d. 311/923), and
Zamaḫšarī used the Kufan term ʿimād to express ḍamīr al-faṣl. Though they
were tracing this usage to Kufan grammarians, ʾAbū Ǧaʿfar al-Naḥḥās (d. 338/
950) used it as if it were his term.13
12
ʿaṭabihi becomes ʿaṭabih to rhyme in the end (cf. Wright 1955:ii, 214).

See footnote 17 for a discussion of the usages of the term ʿimād with a focus on Ṭabarī.

ing to him, ḍamīr al-šaʾn, al-qiṣṣa, and al-ḥadīṯare Basran terms that corres-
pond to the Kufan term al-maǧhūl. The terms ḍamīr al-šaʾn, al-qiṣṣa, and al-
ḥadīṯhad already been mentioned in the books of Ibn al-Sarrāǧ, who used the
term al-maǧhūl, which he traced to Kufan grammarians. Zamaḫšarī made the
same connections. This pronoun was named ḥadīṯand qiṣṣa because it may
standforthespeechorthestorythatismentionedafterthepronoun.Moreover,
this pronoun is always in the 3rd person, because ambiguity is intended. Thus,
the Kufan grammarians called it maǧhūl.

Descriptions in Tafsīr-s
2.1
Preceding Contexts of the Verse
ManyTafsīr-s state that the verse Q. 112/1 is an answer to a question or a request
such as ‘Describe your Lord’ as found in Ṭabarī (d. 310/923):
1.
ThepolytheistsaskedtheMessengerof Godabouttheoriginof Lord
of the might. God revealed this chapter as an answer to them.
2.
[The chapter] was revealed as Jews asked him. They said to him:
‘ThisisGod,Hecreatedthecreatures.ThenwhocreatedGod?’.Thus,
it was revealed as an answer to them.
3.
[The chapter] was revealed as an answer to the polytheists who
asked him to trace for them the Lord the Blessed and Sublime [to
his origin].
4.
[…]The polytheists said to the Prophet ‘trace for us your Lord [to his
origin]’ so God revealed qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥad allāhu l-ṣamad.
5.
[…] The polytheists said ‘Muḥammad, let us know about your Lord.
Describe for us your Lord. What is he? What is he made of?’. Thus,
God revealed qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥad to the end of the chapter.
6.
[…] The leaders of the factions said that [= the following words]:
‘Trace for us your Lord [to his origin]’. Thus, Ǧibrīl brought this.
7.
[…] The polytheists said to the Prophet, ‘Trace for us your Lord [to
his origin]’. Thus, God the Blessed and Sublime revealed qul huwa
llāhu ʾaḥad.
8.
[…] According to the [man] who said ‘He revealed that for the
Jews’ question’, a group of the Jews came to the Prophet and said
‘Muḥammad, this is God. He created creatures. So, who created
Him?’. Thus, the Prophet got angry and the colour of his face
changed.Heattackedthembecauseof angerforthesakeof hisLord.

chapter 10
Then Ǧibrīl came to him and made him calm, and said ‘Make lower
your wing on you, Muḥammad’.The answer for what they asked him
about came to him from God. He said, God says, qul huwa llāhu
ʾaḥad. When the Prophet recited it for them, they said, ‘Describe
for us your Lord. How is his creation? How is his upper arm? How
was his forearm?’. Thus, the Prophet became angrier and attacked
them. Then, Ǧibrīl came to him and said to him something like his
words and brought to him the answer of what they asked him about
[Q. 39/67].
9.
[…] Some people of the Jews came to the Prophet and said ‘Trace for
us your Lord [to his origin]’. Then qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥad was revealed
until the end of the chapter.
ṭabarī Ǧāmiʿ xxiv, 727–72914
In Zamaḫšarī, almost the same as mentioned above, that is, “Qurayš said,
‘Muḥammad, describe for us your Lord that you are calling him to’. Then it
[Q. 112/1] was revealed” (qālat qurayš: yā muḥammad ṣif lanā rabbaka allaḏī
tadʿūnā ʾilayhi fa-nazalat, Tafsīr 1228). Afterwards, he explains the meaning of
ʾaḥadof qulhuwallāhuʾaḥadandsomedifferencesintherecitationof thisverse
(cf. Tafsīr 1228).
Bayḍāwī (d. 685/1288 or 691/1292) says the same: “Qurayš said, ‘Muḥammad,
describe for us your Lord that you are calling him to’. Then it [Q. 112/1] was
revealed” (ʾiḏruwiya ʾanna qurayš qālū: yā muḥammad ṣif lanā rabbaka allaḏī
tadʿūnā ʾilayhi fa-nazalat, ʾAnwār v, 347).
For Maḥallī (d. 864/1459–1460) and Suyūṭī (d. 911/1505), the Prophet was
asked about his Lord, then qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥad was revealed. For them, allāhu
is huwa’s comment and ʾaḥad is its apposition or the second comment (they do
not refer to huwa as ḍamīr al-šaʾn, cf. Maḥallī & Suyūṭī Ǧalālayn 604).
2.2
Ḍamīr al-šaʾn in Tafsīr-s
Ṭabarī introduces some opinions of people of the Arabic language about Q.
112/1:
[1] What makes it [ʾaḥad] nominative is allāh, and huwa is a prop or sup-
port (ʿimād) at the rank of -hu in ʾinnahu ʾanā llāhu l-ʿazīzu l-ḥakīmu.15
14
Cf. the text in the appendix infra.
15
Q. 27/9: “Oh Mūsā, surely it is I, Allah (or I am Allah), the Mighty, theWise”.Ṭabarī explains
-hu in this verse as follows: “hāʾ [he means -hu] in ʾinnahu is a prop hāʾ. It is a noun
(ism) which does not appear in the speech of some people of the Arabic language. Some

[2] No, it [ʾaḥad] is—even though it was indefinite—nominative by
recommencement like hāḏā baʿlī šayḫun.16 He said huwa llāhu (“He is
God”).Ananswertowordsof peoplewhosaidtohim,‘Whatisyourobject

Thoughhe does notusethetermḍamīral-šaʾnin(1),heexplainstheversequite
a bit closer to it, using the term ʿimād.17 On the other hand, he interprets huwa
as an anaphoric pronoun based on the preceding context of the verse.
Zaǧǧāǧ, after dealing with the issue of whether the end of ʾaḥadun is read
with tanwīn or not,18 states the following:
huwa may be for the fact (ʾamr) as you say huwa zaydun qāʾimun “(It
is that) Zayd is standing”, that is, al-ʾamr zayd qāʾim “the fact is that
Zayd is standing”. Its meaning is al-ʾamr allāh ʾaḥad “the fact is that God
is one”. (wa-yaǧūzu ʾan yakūna “huwa” li-l-ʾamr kamā taqūlu “huwa zay-
grammarians of Kufa said that it is ‘unknown (maǧhūl) hāʾ’. It means that the fact (al-
ʾamr) and the matter (al-šaʾn) are that ‘I am God’” (wa-l-hāʾ allatī fī qawlihi “ʾinnahu” hāʾ
ʿimād, wa-huwa ism lā yaẓharu fī qawl baʿḍʾahl al-ʿarabiyya. wa-kāna baʿḍnaḥwiyyī al-kūfa
yaqūlu:hiyaal-hāʾal-maǧhūla,wa-maʿnāhā:ʾinnaal-ʾamrwa-l-šaʾn,ʾanāallāh,Ǧāmiʿ xviii,
13–14).
As mentioned above, Kufan grammarians call the pronoun of the matter ḍamīr al-
maǧhūl, so ‘unknown (maǧhūl) hāʾ’ can be considered as an expression that came from
that.
16
Q. 11/72: “This, my husband, is an old man”.
17
Note that this is not a ‘prop, support’ as Wright said (1955:ii, 259). ʾAbū Ḫuḍayr (2014:139–
141) notes that the term ʿimād is referred to as ḍamīr al-faṣl, that is, what divides ( faṣala)
between topic (mubtadaʾ) and comment (ḫabar), which the Kufan grammarians called
ʿimād; with regard to Ṭabarī, the term ʿimād includes more than a meaning, and its func-
tion in the sentence is to divide ( faṣl) between the affairs as follows: (1) topic and com-
ment, (2) topic of kāna and its sisters (and their comment), (3) two objects of ẓanna and
its sisters, and (4) topic, comment, and circumstantial expression (ḥāl). The term ʿimād
in his Tafsīr-s has two main meanings: (1) ḍamīr al-šaʾn and (2) ḍamīr al-faṣl. With regard
to the former, the Kufan grammarians sometimes call it al-maǧhūl, ‘unknown’. It includes
pronouns used in a sentence that begins with mā for negation, as in Q. 2/96. In this case,
Ṭabarī allows for ḍamīr al-šaʾn and the comment to precede the topic, following the ideas
of the Kufan grammarians.
18
While this paper does not treat this theme, it is an important argument that other inter-
preters have dealt with.

dun qāʾimun”, ʾay al-ʾamr zayd qāʾim, al-maʿnā al-ʾamr allāh ʾaḥad, Zaǧǧāǧ
Maʿānī v, 377)
He does not use the term ḍamīral-šaʾn, either, but regards the pronoun huwa as
something for the fact (ʾamr), so his explanation is very close to ḍamīr al-šaʾn.
Zamaḫšarī, who is a grammarian,describes this verseas ananswertoa ques-
tion from Qurayš as mentioned in the previous section, but in addition, he
explains huwa as a ḍamīr al-šaʾn, as shown below:
huwa is a pronoun of the matter (ḍamīr al-šaʾn) and allāhu ʾaḥadun is the
matter (al-šaʾn), as your utterance: huwa zaydun munṭaliqun “(It is that)
Zayd is going on / Zayd is away”, as if it is said that al-šaʾn hāḏā wa-huwa
ʾanna allāha wāḥidun lā ṯāniya lahu “the matter is this and it is that God
is one, without an alternative for him”.
If you say ‘What is the role of huwa?’, I say ‘Nominative because of its
beingatopic[of thenominalsentence]andthecommentisthesentence’.
If you say ‘then the sentence that exists as a comment must have in
itself what returns to the topic.19 Where is rāǧiʿ ?’, I maintain that the
status for this sentence [as a comment] is the same as that for a single
word in the utterance zaydun ġulāmuka ‘Zayd is your lad’ because it [ġu-
lāmuka] has a meaning that is equal to the topic [zaydun]. This means
that His saying allāhu ʾaḥad regards the matter (al-šaʾn), about which
huwa is an expression.
Zaydun ʾabūhu munṭaliqun “As for Zayd, his father is going on / his
father is away” is not the same. Zaydun and the sentence [ʾabūhu mun-
ṭaliqun] refer to two different referents; thus, they need to be connected
[by something (that is, a pronoun)].
(“huwa” ḍamīr al-šaʾn wa-“allāhu ʾaḥadun” huwa al-šaʾn. ka-qawlika:
“huwa zaydun munṭaliqun”: ka-ʾannahu qīla: al-šaʾn hāḏā wa-huwa ʾanna

19
Rāǧiʿ, what returns to the topic, is a pronoun that refers to the topic, though this term is
usually used for a “resumptive pronoun” of a relative clause.

This part is revised as “ḫabar al-ʾabad” but it is not correct.

Ḍamīr al-šaʾn in Grammatical Studies
Sībawayhi (d. 180/796?) quotes in his Kitāb Q. 112/1 only in the section about the
ways to read tanwīn at the end of ʾaḥadun (Kitāb iv, 152, cf. ʿIbāda 2002: 244–
246). He mentions pronouns equivalent to ḍamīr al-šaʾn, but the term ḍamīr
al-šaʾn itself is not used. He explains it using the expression māfīʾinnahu (what
is in ʾinnahu). Moreover, ḍamīr al-šaʾn in independent forms is ignored.
Sībawayhi describes ḍamīr al-šaʾn (though he never uses this term, as men-
tioned above) as suffix pronouns and omitted (maḥḏūf ) pronouns in order to
explain verb conjugations and noun inflections.
Examples of suffix pronouns (cf. Kitāb i, 69):
ʾinnahu man yaʾtinā naʾtihi “(It is that) as for the man who comes to us, we
come to him”
ʾinnahu ʾamatu llāhi ḏāhibatun “(It is that) God’s slave girl is going”
Examples of omitted pronouns (Kitāb i, 70–71):
laysa ḫalaqa llāhu miṯlahu “It is not that God created his equivalent [=
God did not create his equivalent]”
wa-laysa kulla l-nawā tulqī l-masākīnu “It is not that the miserable
people threw all the date pits [= The miserable people did not throw all
the date pits]”
kāda tazīġu qulūbu farīqin minhum21 “(It is that) the hearts of a party
of them had almost inclined”
In his Muqtaḍab, Mubarrad (d. 285/898 or 286/899) does not use the term
ḍamīr al-šaʾn, either, and he also ignores ḍamīr al-šaʾn in independent forms.
For instance, he gives some examples of ḍamīr al-šaʾn as an omitted pronoun,
such as: kāna ġulāmahu zaydun ḍāribun “It was that Zayd is hitting his lad [=
Zayd was hitting his lad]” (cf. Muqtaḍab iv, 99). In this sentence, the pronoun
is hidden in kāna.
21
Q. 9/117. According to Hārūn’s footnote (cf. Sībawayhi Kitāb i, 71, fn. 3), this way of reading
(tazīġu) is mainstream, and Ḥamza (d. 156/772) and Ḥafṣ(d. 180/796) read it as yazīġu.

chapter 10
The example Sībawayhi quoted, too, is quoted: wa-laysa kulla l-nawā yulqī
l-masākīnu (however, yulqī is masculine, cf. Muqtaḍab iv, 100, the pronoun
hidden in laysa).
Ibn Ǧinnī (d. 392/1002) also mentions the verse Q. 112/1 huwa llāhu ʾaḥadun
in the section where he explains ḍamīr al-šaʾn. He says that (a)llāhu ʾaḥadun is
a tafsīr (exponent) of huwa. For a similar example, he gives the verse Q. 22/46
ʾinnahā lā taʿmā al-ʾabṣāru (lit. ‘She is that the eyesight is not blind’) and
explains that lā taʿmā al-ʾabṣāru ‘the eyesight is not blind’ is the exponent of
-hā so it is also regarded as ḍamīr al-šaʾn. (i, 105). He also points out that the
verse huwa llāhu ʾaḥadun, (a)llāhu ʾaḥadun does not contain any personal pro-
nouns that return to huwa (i, 106).
Zamaḫšarī also refers to the example of ḍamīr al-šaʾn of Q. 112/1. He states in
al-Mufaṣṣal:
Theyletapronouncalledḍamīral-šaʾn(thematter)oral-qiṣṣa(thestory),
which is [ḍamīr] al-maǧhūl (the unknown) in the Kufan school, precede
before the sentence. That is like your utterance huwa zaydun munṭaliqun,
that is, the matter and the speech (al-ḥadīṯ) is that Zayd is going on. One
of the examples of such a pronoun is the word of the Sublime qul huwa
llāhu ʾaḥad. Such a pronoun saliently appears in your utterance.
ẓanantuhu zaydun qāʾimun “I thought that (it is that) Zayd was stand-
ing”, ḥasibtuhu qāma ʾaḫūka “I thought that (it is that) your brother had
stood”, ʾinnahuʾamatullāhiḏāhibatun “(It is that) God’s slave girl is going”,
ʾinnahu man yaʾtinā naʾtihi “(It is that) as for the man who comes to us, we
come to him”, and in the revelation ʾannahu lammā qāma ʿabdu llāhi22
“(It is that) when God’s slave stood…”. (wa-yuqaddimūna qabla al-ǧumla

Ibn Yaʿīš šm iii, 114)
Thus, he mentions the verse Q. 112/1, that is, the example of ḍamīr al-šaʾn is also
as an independent pronoun (cf. Ibn Yaʿīš šm iii, 114). Ibn Yaʿīš (d. 643/1245) also
explains it as a cataphoric pronoun in his Šarḥal-Mufaṣṣal (iii, 114–118).

on interpretation of the pronoun huwa in 112/1 of the qurʾān
235
Ibn Mālik (d. 672/1274), who studied al-Mufaṣṣal under Ibn Yaʿīš, does not
mention ḍamīr al-šaʾn in the section of personal pronouns in his ʾAlfiyya, but
in the sections of kāna and its sisters (ʾAlfiyya, v. 153, 144) as muḍmar al-šaʾn,23
and ẓanna and its sisters (ʾAlfiyya, v. 211, 219).
Ibn ʿAqīl (d. 769/1367), who wrote a commentary (Šarḥ), refers to ḍamīr al-
šaʾn in the section of ʾinna and its sisters, that is, in his interpretation for v. 193
(ʾAlfiyya, v. 193, 193). However, none of them use ḍamīr al-šaʾn as an independ-
ent pronoun.
Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī gives seven kinds of the cataphoric pronouns in his
ŠarḥŠuḏūr al-ḏahab, and shows ḍamīr al-šaʾn at the top, using the example
of Q. 112/1:
One of them [that is, cataphoric]: ḍamīr al-šaʾn category. Like huwa—or
hiya—zaydun qāʾimun “(It is that) Zayd is standing” that is, the matter,
the speech (al-ḥadīṯ) or the story (al-qiṣṣa). It is explained by the sen-
tence that comes after it; It [the sentence] is the same speech and story.

Q. 112/1 in ʾiʿrāb al-Qurʾān Books
By and large, huwa in Q. 112/1 is mainly explained as ḍamīr al-šaʾn, or what is
close to ḍamīr al-šaʾn, in the early ʾiʿrāb al-Qurʾān books, as follows:
23
ʿAbābnih (2006:27) summarizes the change of the terms which indicate personal pro-
nouns as follows: first, Sībawayhi used ʾiḍmār, as well as the term muḍmar, many times
in his Kitāb. On the other hand, the term ḍamīr seems to appear after Sībawayhi. ʿAbāb-
nihsupposesthatitmaybeusedforthefirsttimein Maʿānīal-Qurʾānof al-ʾAḫfašal-ʾAwsaṭ
(d. 215/830). Afterwards, Basran scholars began to use ḍamīr as a well-known term while
the usage of the term muḍmar was also common until the age of Zamaḫšarī, though it
has become less used. However, Ayoub (2019:35) points out that the term ḍamīr occurs in
Sībawayhi’s Kitāb six times. Five of them clearly mean personal pronouns, though one of
them refers to the mind of a speaker. According to one of the reviewer, muḍmar al-šaʾn is
only found in the ʾAlfiyya, and the reason for choosing muḍmar instead of ḍamīr plausibly
lies in the meter of the ʾAlfiyya.

chapter 10
[1] huwa in Q. 112/1 is the pronoun of the fact and the matter (al-ḍamīr
li-l-ʾamr wa-l-šaʾn), so this verse means “say, the matter and the fact are
‘Allāh is One’”. [2] huwa refers to Allāh, and allāhu is an apposition of
huwa and explains it. ( fa-ʾammā qawluhu “qul huwa llāhu ʾaḥad” fa-qīla:
al-ḍamīrli-l-ʾamrwa-l-šaʾn,ʾay:qulal-ʾamrwa-l-šaʾn“allāhuʾaḥad”wa-qīla:

Bāqūlī/Zaǧǧāǧ ʾIʿrāb ii, 564)
Naḥḥās explains that huwa of Q. 112/1 is nominative because of its ibtidāʾ (being
a topic of a nominal sentence), and it means speech (ḥadīṯ), that is, the speech
which is the truth that Allāh is One (cf. Naḥḥās ʾIʿrāb v, 194).
Ibn Ḫālawayhi (d. 370/980) does not regard huwa in Q. 112/1 as ḍamīr al-šaʾn,
but as a nominative because of its ibtidāʾ (being a topic of a nominal sentence).
Here allāhu is its comment (cf. Ibn Ḫālawayhi ʾIʿrāb 242), and ʾaḥadun is the
apposition of allāhu (cf. Ibn Ḫālawayhi ʾIʿrāb 243). He regards this verse as an
answer to the question ‘inform us about Allāh the sublime, is he made of gold,
silver or musk?’ (cf. Ibn Ḫālawayhi ʾIʿrāb 243).
For ʾAbū ʿAlī al-Fārisī (d. 377/987), the pronoun huwa in Q. 112/1 is explained,
with hiya in Q. 21/97,25 as what is explained by a sentence; that is, the verse
Q. 112/1 means al-ʾamr allāhu ʾaḥadun (“the fact is that Allāh is One”). He does
not use the term ḍamīr al-šaʾn, but he explains it as ḍamīr al-šaʾn (cf. ʾIġfāl 333).
Ḫaṭīb al-Tabrīzī (d. 502/1109) does not mention Q. 112/1 (cf. Mulaḫḫaṣ) but
Zamaḫšarī says about huwa in Q. 112/1 that it is nominative because of its ibtidāʾ
(being a topic of a nominal sentence), and its comment is the sentence (Nukat
375); that is, he does not use the term ḍamīr al-šaʾn, but he explains it as ḍamīr
al-šaʾn.
ʿUkbarī (d. 616/1219) presents two explanations for huwa in Q. 112/1; that is,
(1) it is ḍamīr al-šaʾn, and (2) the verse is an answer to the question ‘is your
Lord made of copper or gold?’. Thus, huwa is a topic, allāhu is its comment and
ʾaḥadun is an apposition or a comment of an omitted topic. It may be accepted
that allāhu is an apposition and ʾaḥadun is its comment, too (cf. ʾImlāʾ ii, 297).
Finally, Zakariyyā al-ʾAnṣārī (d. 926/1520?) clearly states that huwa in Q. 112/1
is ḍamīr al-šaʾn (cf. ʾAnṣārī ʾIʿrāb 505).

Ḍamīr al-šaʾn in Q. 18/38 and Q. 34/27
Here, let us take a brief look at ḍamīr al-šaʾn other than one in Q. 112/1. Accord-
ing to Ziyādī (2006), there are two more pronouns of the matter in the Qurʾān,
namely Q. 18/38 and Q. 34/27:
lākinnā26 huwa llāhu rabbī (Q. 18/38)
But as for me, He is Allāh, my Lord [= It (the matter) is that Allāh is my
Lord];
bal huwa llāhu l-ʿazīzu l-ḥakīmu (Q. 34/27)
Rather, He is Allāh, the Exalted in Might, theWise [= It (the matter) is that
Allāh is the Exalted in Might, the Wise].
Let us look at the explanations of these two pronouns in 1. Tafsīr-s, 2. ʾiʿrāb al-
Qurʾān books, and 3. grammar books.
5.1
Q. 18/38 and Q. 34/27 in Tafsīr-s
As for Q. 18/38, Ṭabarī explains that its meaning is wa-lākin ʾanā ʾaqūlu: huwa
llāhu rabbī “although I say: he is Allāh, my Lord”. However, he mostly leaves the
pronoun huwa (cf. Ǧāmiʿ xv, 263–264), and huwa of Q. 34/27 (cf. Ǧāmiʿ xix,
288), unexplained.
Zamaḫšarī clearly states that huwa in Q. 18/38 is ḍamīr al-šaʾn, and that the
fact(ʾamr)isallāhurabbī “AllāhismyLord”,butheregardsthissentence(allāhu
rabbī) as a comment of (ʾa)nā, not huwa,27 and the pronoun which returns to
(ʾa)nā is -ī of rabbī (cf.Tafsīr 620). For Q. 34/27, he states that huwa is a pronoun
which returns only to allāhu or ḍamīr al-šaʾn, the same as huwa in Q. 112/1 (cf.
Tafsīr 874).
For Bayḍāwī the pronoun huwa in Q. 18/38 is ḍamīr al-šaʾn and it is a com-
ment of (ʾa)nā because of the sentence which is regarded as the comment of
huwa. This huwa may also be a pronoun for allāhu, and allāhu is its apposition
and rabbī is the comment. This sentence is the comment of (ʾa)nā. (cf. ʾAnwār
iii,281).AsforthepronounhuwainQ.34/27,itisforallāhuorforthefact(ʾamr)
(cf. ʾAnwār iv, 247).
Maḥallī & Suyūṭī say that huwa of Q. 18/38 is ḍamīr al-šaʾn and that the sen-
tence after it explains this huwa. (Lākin)-nā huwa means “I say ʾanā ʾaqūlu”. (cf.
Ǧalālayn 298). They do not explain huwa of Q. 34/27 (cf. Ǧalālayn 431).
26
wa-lākinnā < wa-lākin-ʾanā, ʾa is omitted according to many Tafsīr-s.
27
This matter needs more investigation but it may be interpreted close to ḍamīr al-faṣl.

chapter 10
As for the two huwa-s which appear in the middle of the chapters, being
different from huwa of Q. 112/1, their preceding contexts are not discussed in
Tafsīr-s.
Broadly speaking, Zamaḫšarī began to interpret these huwa-s as ḍamīr al-
šaʾn in Tafsīr-s; however, Zamaḫšarī’s explanation of huwa in Q. 18/38 contains
adescriptionwhichdoesnotfullyexplainḍamīral-šaʾn(cf.abovefn.27),mean-
ing it requires more investigation.
5.2
Q. 18/28 and Q. 34/27 in ʾiʿrāb al-Qurʾān Books
Zaǧǧāǧ does not mention either Q. 18/38 or Q. 34/27 (cf. ʾIʿrāb). As for Q. 18/38,
Naḥḥās explains about -nā that it is (ʾa)nā of wa-lākinnā (cf. ʾIʿrāb ii, 295) but
he says nothing about Q. 34/27. Ibn Ḫālawayhi does not mention either Q. 18/38
or Q. 34/27. ʾAbū ʿAlī al-Fārisī mentions Q. 18/38 (cf. ʾIġfāl 375–376) but only
explains the -nā in wa-lākinnā (that is, (ʾa)nā) and does not say anything about
Q. 34/27.
Ḫaṭīb al-Tabrīzī only mentions Q. 18/38 (cf. Mulaḫḫaṣ206–208); however,
his explanation is mainly about the -nā in wa-lākinnā (that is, (ʾa)nā). He says
nothing about huwa. As for Zamaḫšarī, his explanation about Q. 18/38 does not
contain anything about huwa (cf. Nukat 257), and he does not refer to Q. 34/27.
In ʿUkbarī’s explanation for Q. 18/38, (ʾa)nā is regarded as a topic (mubtadaʾ),
huwa as a second topic, allāhu as a third topic, and rabbī as its comment; the -ī
of rabbī is a pronoun which returns to the first topic, that is, (ʾa)nā (cf. ʾImlāʾ ii,
103), but he says nothing about Q. 34/27.
Finally, Zakariyyā al-ʾAnṣārī says that, as for Q. 18/38, (ʾa)nā is a topic (mub-
tadaʾ), huwa is a second topic, allāhu is a third topic and rabbī is its comment.
This sentence (allāhu rabbī) is a comment of huwa, and huwa and what fol-
lows it are a comment of (ʾa)nā (cf. ʾIʿrāb 262). This explanation, that huwa is
the topic of the sentence allāhu rabbī, shows that this is a ḍamīr al-šaʾn sen-
tence structure, though he does not use the term ḍamīral-šaʾn. His explanation
about Q. 34/27 (cf. ʾIʿrāb 354) is only on kallā, which occurs at the beginning of
the verse, but he says nothing about the pronoun huwa.
By and large, Q. 18/38 and Q. 34/27 are not standing out in the ʾiʿrābal-Qurʾān
books, and we hardly find explanations about huwa in them. Even Zamaḫšarī
does not deal with these two huwa-s. However, ʿUkbarī and Zakariyyā al-ʾAnṣārī
after Zamaḫšarī make some explanations close to ḍamīr al-šaʾn for huwa in
Q. 18/38.
5.3
Q. 18/28 and Q. 34/27 in Grammar Books
Sībawayhi never mentions these two verses in his Kitāb (cf. ʿIbāda 2002). Mu-
barrad, the head of the Basran school, does not refer to them in his Muqtaḍab

either.AsforŠarḥal-Mufaṣṣal,thecommentaryonZamaḫšarī’sgrammarbook,
Ibn Yaʿīš does not refer to Q. 34/27 in it. He mentions Q. 18/38, but the descrip-
tion is not about huwa but wa-lākinnā.
Ibn Mālik, who studied al-Mufaṣṣal under IbnYaʿīš, does not refer to the two
verses in his ʾAlfiyya, and Ibn ʿAqīl does not in his commentary on it either.
Ibn Hišām al-ʾAnṣārī gives seven kinds of cataphoric pronouns in his Šarḥ
Šuḏūr al-ḏahab. Ḍamīr al-šaʾn is the first one which includes the example of
Q. 112/1 (cf. šš 136), but he mentions neither Q. 18/38 nor Q. 34/27, at least not
in this passage.
In contrast to Tafsīr-s, principal grammar books do not refer to the two
verses. Even after Zamaḫšarī, who began to explain huwa as an independent
pronoun in Q. 122/1 as ḍamīr al-šaʾn, Q. 18/38 and Q. 34/27 still have no pres-
ence.

that, in Ibn Ǧinnī’s time in grammar books, and in even earlier times in ʾiʿrāb

As for huwa in Q. 18/38 and Q. 34/27, the following two points have become
plain:
1.
we find some differences between the explanations of the two verses in
Tafsīr-s and those in grammar books, and
2.
in ʾiʿrāb al-Qurʾān books, the way of dealing with huwa in the two verses
is clearly different from the way of dealing with huwa in Q. 112/1.
Generally, huwa in the verses Q. 18/38 and Q. 34/27 are not explained clearly as
ḍamīr al-šaʾn many times. The reasons may be:
1.
ḍamīr al-šaʾn in the Qurʾān mainly appear as suffix pronouns, and
2.
these two verses have preceding contexts, so huwa can be interpreted as
an anaphoric pronoun.

Conclusion
This paper has examined the interpretations of huwa in descriptions in Q. 112/1.
It may be said that in Tafsīr-s, huwa in Q. 112/1 came to be recognised as a
cataphoric ḍamīr al-šaʾn around the time of a Zamaḫšarī; however, in Arabic
grammar books, Ibn Ǧinnī had already covered it as ḍamīr al-šaʾn, and in ʾiʿrāb
al-Qurʾān books, it had long ago been explained as ḍamīr al-šaʾn. Nonetheless,
this huwa has been interpreted as an anaphoric pronoun until now because:

and
2.
in Modern Arabic, independent pronouns are not used as ḍamīr al-šaʾn,
and even in the Qurʾān, ḍamīr al-šaʾn in suffix pronouns are found more
than independent forms (only three examples of independent forms are
found in the Qurʾān).
ʾIʿrāb books, as grammar books, emphasize grammatical explanations. In con-
trast, the Tafsīr-s, which aim to interpret and comment on Qurʾānic texts, con-
tain more descriptions of the traditions surrounding the verse rather than syn-
tactic explanations.
The difference in interpretation of the huwa in Q. 112/1 can be attributed to
the difference in purpose between the ʾIʿrāb books and grammar books that
aim to explain syntax and the Tafsīr-s, which aim to interpret the meaning of
the verses. Symbolically, it was not until the time of Zamaḫšarī, who was also
a grammarian, that huwa came to be recognised as ḍamīr al-šaʾn in Tafsīr-s. In
other words, the grammatical research that had been done up to that point
came to be utilized in the interpretations of the Qurʾān.
