Foreword
A smoothly running automobile is one of life’s delights; it enables you to
get where you need to get, on time, with great reliability, and for the most
part, you get there in style, with music playing, air conditioning keeping
you comfortable, and GPS guiding your path. We tend to take cars for
granted in the developed world, treating them as one of life’s constants,
a resource that is always available. We plan our life’s projects with the
assumption that of course a car will be part of our environment. But
when your car breaks down, your life is seriously disrupted. Unless you
are a car buﬀwith technical training you confront your dependence on a
web of tow-truck operators, mechanics, car dealers, and much more. At
some point, you decide to trade in your increasingly unreliable car and
start afresh with a brand new model. Life goes on, with hardly a ripple.
But what about the huge system that makes this all possible: the high-
ways, the oil reﬁneries, the auto makers, the insurance companies, the
banks, the stock market, the government? Our civilization has been run-
ning smoothly—with some serious disruptions—for thousands of years,
growing in complexity and power. Could it break down? Yes, it could,
and to whom could we then turn to help us get back on the road? You
can’t buy a new civilization if yours collapses, so we had better keep the
civilization we have running in good repair. Who, though, are the reliable
mechanics? The politicians, the judges, the bankers, the industrialists,
the journalists, the professors—the leaders of our society, in short, are
much more like the average motorist than you might like to think: doing
their local bit to steer their part of the whole contraption, while blissfully
ignorant of the complexities on which the whole system depends. The
optimistic tunnel vision with which they operate is not, Paul Seabright
argues, a deplorable and correctable ﬂaw in the system but an enabling
condition. The ediﬁces of social construction that shape our lives in so
many regards depend on our myopic conﬁdence that their structure is
sound and needs no attention from us.

xii • Foreword
At one point Seabright compares our civilization with a termite cas-
tle. Both are artifacts, marvels of ingenious design piled on ingenious
design, towering over the supporting terrain, the work of vastly many
individuals acting in concert. Both are thus byproducts of the evolution-
ary processes that created and shaped those individuals, and in both
cases, the design innovations that account for the remarkable resiliency
and eﬃciency observable were not the brainchildren of individuals, but
happy outcomes of the largely unwitting, myopic endeavors of those
individuals, over many generations. But there are profound diﬀerences
as well. Human cooperation is a delicate and remarkable phenomenon,
quite unlike the almost mindless cooperation of termites, and indeed
quite unprecedented in the natural world, a unique feature with a unique
ancestry in evolution.
Much has been written about “the social construction of reality” and
(much better) the “construction of social reality,” but most of it is writ-
ten by thinkers who—like naive car owners—are full of admiration for
the marvel they are describing but haven’t a clue about how this con-
struction actually has taken place, and why the parts intermesh the way
they do. These life-enhancing institutions are made of interacting, inter-
locking systems of beliefs—about what to expect, what not to expect,
what to worry about, what to take for granted, what is possible, and
what is (almost) unthinkable. We tend to take this structure as given, a
permanent fact of life, but it is in fact a quite recent development, bio-
logically speaking, and although it has some remarkable powers of self-
stabilization, it is not as invulnerable as common sense typically sup-
poses. As the biologist D’Arcy Thompson said, many years ago, “every-
thing is the way it is because it got that way,” and the deep idea behind
this truism is that a keen appreciation of the compromises and tensions
that have gone into this largely unwitting construction is a prerequisite
for understanding both the strengths and fragilities of the social vehicle
on which our life as human beings now depends. Seabright constructs
our economic world piece by piece, showing why there is money, and
banks, and ﬁrms, and marketing, and insurance, and government regu-
lation, and poverty, and political insecurity, and also showing how infor-
mation is generated, used, ignored, exploited in this complicated social
fabric.
Like other recent authors, Seabright sees the emergence of cooper-
ation as a truly world-altering phenomenon that requires ultimately a
biological—evolutionary—explanation, but he does not fall into the trap
of Panglossian optimism, as some have done. Cooperation depends, he

Foreword • xiii
argues, on trust, a sort of almost invisible social glue that makes pos-
sible both great and terrible projects, and this trust is not, in fact, a
“natural instinct” hardwired by evolution into our brains. It is much too
recent for that. Rather, it is a byproduct of social conditions that are
at once its enabling condition and its most important product. We have
bootstrapped ourselves into the heady altitudes of modern civilization,
and our natural emotions and other instinctual responses do not always
serve our new circumstances. By reverse engineering these social con-
structions, Seabright exhibits both the source of their power and their
very real and dangerous limitations.
The ﬁrst edition of this book was an eye-opener, an invitation to think
in a new way about our predicament, and this revised edition builds
more explanations on that base, demonstrating the power of the ideas
by applying them to our current economic crises, throwing a particu-
larly powerful light on the tempting mistakes we must avoid if we are
to prevent even more catastrophic future collapses. (For instance, pun-
ishing the crooks and removing the fools from power is only a ﬁrst and
relatively minor part of what needs to be done, since there are systemic
problems that even saints and geniuses could stumble over in the future.)
Like Jared Diamond’s Guns, Germs and Steel, this is a boldly ambi-
tious book, drawing on a breathtaking range of scholarship, from his-
tory and biology and sociology and psychology in addition to economics,
and challenging the blinkered visions of thinkers in all these ﬁelds, while
at the same time making excellent use of the fruits of their researches.
Seabright’s imagination is as powerful as his scholarship, providing fresh
perspectives on just about every page. He has a genius for arresting com-
parisons: how are being wealthy and being ticklish similar, and why are
there driverless trains, but not airplanes? He notes, startlingly, that he
doesn’t have to suppress an urge to kill the waiter and get his meal for
free—which is a temptation that would surely be hard for our cousin
the chimpanzee to resist. This book is the clearest and most persua-
sive demonstration of the power and importance of economic thinking
that I have encountered, and as such it is an ideal primer on economics,
utterly jargon free, with vivid and graceful explanations of all the key
concepts. He punctures popular convictions on almost every page and
elucidates easily misunderstood concepts with graceful examples. He
notes, for instance, that children are, on average, slightly less intelligent
than their parents; but their parents are, on average, slightly more intel-
ligent than their grandparents! How can this be? If this puzzles you, you
haven’t yet seen just how evolution works its inexorable trudge up the

xiv • Foreword
slopes of ﬁtness. He asks questions you never thought of asking, and the
answers are never obvious—except retrospectively.
Think of the termite castle again. We human observers can appreci-
ate its excellence and its complexity in ways that are quite beyond the
nervous systems of its inhabitants. We can also aspire to achieving a
similarly Olympian perspective on our own artifactual world, a feat only
human beings could even imagine. If we don’t succeed, we risk disman-
tling our precious creations in spite of our best intentions. Much of what
we take to be just “common sense” proves to be treacherous, so we need
to rethink the whole thing from ﬁrst principles. That is the task under-
taken by this very important book.

I have been exceptionally fortunate to have so many colleagues and
friends who gave their time, energy, and ideas to encourage and im-
prove this book. Diane Coyle, Isabelle Daudy, Barbarina Digby-Jones,
Jeremy Edwards, Stanley Engerman, Mark Greenberg, Denis Hilton, David
Howarth, Sheilagh Ogilvie, Anne Péchou, Diana Seabright, Jack Seabright,
Keith Stenning, and several anonymous readers all made detailed com-
ments on the whole manuscript. In addition, the following read some or
all of the manuscript at various stages in its preparation and gave me
very useful information or reactions to some of its arguments: Giuseppe
Bertola, Susan Blackmore, Wendy Carlin, John Covell, Nicholas Crafts,
Sophie Dawkins, JeﬀDayton-Johnson, Denis Eckert, Guido Friebel, Mur-
ray Fulton, Azar Gat, Karen Gold, Andrew Goreing, Geoﬀrey Hawthorn,

Tanya Luhrmann, James McWhirter, Patricia Morison, Elizabeth Murry,
Francesca Nicolas, Andrew Schuller, Alice Seabright, Edmond Seabright,
Victor Saraﬁan, and Kay Sexton. The following responded kindly and
promptly to requests for information and advice: Kaushik Basu, Ravi
Kanbur, Paul Klemperer, and Leigh Shaw-Taylor. Jennifer Gann provided
a massive input to the notes, bibliography, and index as well as many
wise comments on the text.
It has been a pleasure to work with Richard Baggaley, my editor at
Princeton. He followed the project from an embryonic stage and has been
an untiring source of advice; the book’s title was his coinage. His col-
league Peter Dougherty has also taken a keen interest in the project, and
I have beneﬁted greatly from his experience as a publisher and writer.
The book was steered through production by Linny Schenck and Kath-
leen Cioﬃwith the immensely professional copyediting skills of Vicky
Wilson-Schwartz and the design talents of Leslie Flis. Carolyn Hollis
provided valuable administrative support.

Thanks to the intermediation of Patricia Morison and Felicity Bryan,
Catherine Clarke began acting as my agent before we had ever had more
than email and telephone contact. My daughter Alice found this strange:
“How can you trust to represent you someone you’ve never even met?”
She then thought a moment and added, “I suppose that’s what your
book’s all about, really.” She was right only up to a point: I’ve been lucky
to ﬁnd an agent whose personal and professional qualities exceed any-
thing for which social institutions can possibly take the credit.
I began writing this book in Cambridge, England, and completed it
in Toulouse, at the outstanding research environment of the Institut
d’Economie Industrielle. Its founder Jean-Jacques Laﬀont and current
director Jacques Crémer, its scientiﬁc director Jean Tirole, the President
of the University of Toulouse-1 Bernard Belloc, and their colleagues Marc
Ivaldi and Michel Moreaux were all instrumental in enabling me to move
to Toulouse. I am grateful to them all, and to the many other researchers
in Toulouse who have made it such a personally as well as an intellectu-
ally stimulating place.
Besides those named above, I am grateful to the following, who, in
many diverse ways that only they can know, have given me information,
ideas, practical support, or inspiration, sometimes all four: David Begg,
Robert Boyd, Sam Bowles, Florence Chauvet, Sabrina Choudar, Partha
Dasgupta, Jayasri Dutta, Jon Elster, Rosalind English, Ernst Fehr, Chris-
tiane Fioupou, David Hart, Lucy Heller, Angela Hobbs, Peregrine Hor-
den, Susan Hurley, John Kay, Joanna Lewis, Sylvie Mercusot, Alice Mes-
nard, Jim Mirrlees, Damien Neven, Nicholas Rawlins, Gilles St. Paul, Larry
Siedentop, John Sutton, Susie Symes, and John Vickers.
Isabelle Daudy has been a constant support and sounding board for
ideas. She urged me for many years to write a book for the general reader
and has often helped me resist the pressure for the urgent to drive out
the important. Our children, Alice, Edmond, and Luke Seabright, have
constantly reminded me that the world around us is strange and needs
explaining; this book is dedicated to them.
And ﬁnally, thanks to all the agricultural laborers, banana-growers,
carpenters, dentists, engineers, ﬂower-sellers, grocers, handbag-makers,
inspectors, jewelers, knife-grinders, lathe-operators, midwives, night-
watchmen, organists, potters, quantity surveyors, reed-makers, seam-
stresses, tattooists, undertakers, vets, window-cleaners, xylophonists,
yogurt-makers, and zoologists (to name but a few) that I have met and
talked with in the course of thinking about the issues discussed in this
book.

Acknowledgments for the Revised Edition
As the acknowledgments to the ﬁrst edition recorded, I have been excep-
tionally lucky to have enjoyed the help and advice of a large number of
people in writing this book. Since the ﬁrst edition appeared my debts
have multiplied so that I am now, intellectually speaking, distinctly sub-
prime. To record all of those from whom I have learned valuable lessons
would take many pages, so I shall just list here those who provided new
references, made speciﬁc comments on the revised edition manuscript,
or corrected errors in the text of the ﬁrst. These are Nicoletta Berardi,
Samuel Bowles, Diane Coyle, Tyler Cowen, Kimmo Ericsson, David Fair-
bairn, Xavier Freixas, Herbert Gintis, Charles Goodhart, Markus Haller,

Partridge, Jean Pisani-Ferry, Jean-Charles Rochet, Bob Rowthorn, Alice
Seabright, Diana Seabright, Jack Seabright, Stephen Shennan, Helen Wal-
lace, Jacob Weisdorf, and David Wiggins. Susan Hurley and Jean-Jacques
Laﬀont are two friends who greatly inspired me when I was writing the
ﬁrst edition and whose shrewd advice I now sorely miss.
Richard Baggaley has been an outstanding and consistently supportive
editor, and Peter Dougherty’s backing for this project has been inspiring
from the start. Catherine Clarke is the wisest agent anyone could wish
for. I am extremely grateful to Jon Wainwright of T&T Productions Ltd
for his patient and very shrewd copyediting, and to Dan Dennett for his
wonderfully generous foreword. And my thanks go as always to Isabelle,

Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition
Social Trust and Financial Crises
Modern societies are fragile. There are rare but dangerous moments
when a fresh wind blowing suddenly from an unexpected quarter brings
apparently solid buildings crashing down. Such collapses are no less dan-
gerous when they involve the intangible structures of our social life: the
informal norms and formal institutions that ensure that trust takes the
place of mutual suspicion. The collapse may be triggered from outside,
as in wartime, or it may be set oﬀ, more mysteriously, from within—
by some subterranean evolution of mutual attitudes that casts sudden
doubt on the trust that was once taken for granted. Whether the result
is an outbreak of physical violence or the collapse of an economy of
reciprocal exchange, understanding those underground developments
and their sudden visible manifestation is one of the greatest challenges
for our ability to understand the world we live in.
The ﬁnancial crisis that began in 2007 was one of these eruptions.
It came as a rude shock, not only to establishment policymakers who
had been congratulating themselves on a long period of stable eco-
nomic growth throughout most of the world, but also to many work-
ers, savers, and investors who had simply stopped worrying about their
future. Within a few months the world saw the ﬁrst run on a British bank
since the nineteenth century, the ﬁrst sustained fall in U.S. house prices
during the twenty years that systematic indices have been kept, a col-
lapse of more than half in the value of shares traded on world stock
markets, and the freezing-up of the interbank lending market. Within
two years there were losses on American loans estimated by the IMF at
nearly 9,000 dollars per man, woman, and child in the United States,1
and the most dramatic falls in output in the major industrialized coun-
tries since the Great Depression. What kind of a panic was this? What
were its subterranean causes, and what triggered their eruption into the
open air?

2 • Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition
This book is about the trust that underpins our social life, and in par-
ticular about what enables us to trust complete strangers with our jobs,
our savings, even our lives. It is also about what happens when that
trust breaks down, as it did recently in the world of banking and as it
has done at many times in our history, sometimes with terrifying conse-
quences. Historians and sociologists have long been fascinated by social
panics,2 and the more mysterious the causes the more fascinating they
have found them. What prompted societies throughout Europe from the
ﬁfteenth to the seventeenth centuries to decide that hundreds of thou-
sands of people, many of them elderly and eccentric old women, were in
fact dangerous witches deserving of torture and execution? “Irrational-
ity” is not an answer: if Newton and Locke could believe in witchcraft,
intelligence and a scientiﬁc outlook were no defense against the panic.
What prompted the Brazilian government in 1897, egged on by the press
and public opinion, to slaughter many thousands of the followers of the
religious mystic Antonio Conseilheiro, who had withdrawn to the remote
settlement of Canudos precisely so as to be out of the world’s way? Why
did thousands of Xhosa people respond in 1856 to the prophecy of a
teenage girl named Nongqawuse by slaughtering hundreds of thousands
of their cattle, thereby provoking a famine that killed perhaps as much
as three-quarters of the population?3 And (to cite a less violent example
that has intrigued sociologists) why did the population of Orléans in May
1969 become convinced that a vast operation to kidnap young women
and force them into prostitution was being orchestrated by the own-
ers of six dress shops in their city center?4 There have been individuals
prone to deranged and paranoid fantasies in all societies at all times for
which we have records, but most large modern societies usually manage
to conﬁne them, or at least their fantasies, to the margins. Why do they
sometimes overﬂow those margins and wash into the mainstream?
The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007 has not yet led to large-scale violence,
although as the Great Depression of the 1930s may have had some
responsibility for World War II it would be foolish to engage in self-
congratulation too early. But this crisis is not just a panic like the others.
The inhabitants of Canudos could have gone on living in peace more or
less for ever if their fellow citizens had been willing to let them. Nothing
obliged the populations of early modern Europe to escalate with such
savagery their suspicions of eccentricity among their unfortunate fellow
citizens. Although fantasies of kidnapped women have surfaced regu-
larly throughout history, there was no compelling reason for the citizens
of Orléans to succumb to them in 1969. But the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007

Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition • 3
did not just appear from nowhere out of a cloudless sky. It took time
to develop, and it followed an unsustainable boom: the unraveling of
conﬁdence during the crisis can only be understood in the light of the
slipshod architecture of that conﬁdence. Understanding why the boom
was unsustainable is the key to understanding the panic that followed. It
is also the key to understanding how to build a sustainable architecture
of social trust.
The ﬁnancial crisis is both an example of and a test case for the argu-
ment of this book. The institutions of our social life underpin the trust
we place in strangers. If sometimes that trust is misplaced it is because
these institutions, most of the time, do a job so extraordinary that we
have quite forgotten what a miracle it is that we ever trust strangers at
all. Trusting strangers is, to put it simply, a most unnatural thing for us
to do. It is like a foreign language we have learned to speak with such
assurance that we are all the more unnerved by our inevitable mistakes
and the sometimes spectacular confusions to which these give rise. To
understand why it is so unnatural, and why we have nevertheless learned
how to trust strangers so commonly and so easily, we need to delve far
back into our evolutionary past.
The Great Experiment
Our everyday life is much stranger than we imagine, and rests on fragile
foundations. This is the startling message of the evolutionary history
of humankind. Our teeming, industrialized, networked existence is not
some gradual and inevitable outcome of human development over mil-
lions of years. Instead we owe it to an extraordinary experiment launched
a mere ten thousand years ago.∗No one could have predicted this exper-
iment from observing the course of our previous evolution, but it would
forever change the character of life on our planet. For around that time,
after the end of the last ice age, one of the most aggressive and elu-
sive bandit species in the entire animal kingdom began to settle down. It
was one of the great apes—a close cousin of chimpanzees and bonobos,
and a lucky survivor of the extinctions that had wiped out several other
promising branches of the chimpanzee family.5 Like the chimpanzee it
was violent, mobile, intensely suspicious of strangers, and used to hunt-
ing and ﬁghting in bands composed mainly of close relatives. Yet now,
instead of ranging in search of food, it began to keep herds and grow
∗This is equivalent to about two and a half minutes ago on a twenty-four-hour clock
that began ticking when our evolution diverged from the rest of the animal kingdom.

4 • Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition
crops, storing them in settlements that limited the ape’s mobility and
exposed it to the attentions of the very strangers it had hitherto fought
or ﬂed. Within a few hundred generations—barely a pause for breath
in evolutionary time—it had formed social organizations of startling
complexity. Not just village settlements but cities, armies, empires, cor-
porations, nation-states, political movements, humanitarian organiza-
tions, even internet communities. The same shy, murderous ape that
had avoided strangers throughout its evolutionary history was now liv-
ing, working, and moving among complete strangers in their millions.
Homo sapiens sapiens is the only animal that engages in elaborate task-
sharing—the division of labor as it is sometimes known—between genet-
ically unrelated members of the same species.6 It is a phenomenon as
remarkable and uniquely human as language itself. Most human beings
now obtain a large share of the provision for their daily lives from others
to whom they are not related by blood or marriage. Even in poor rural
societies people depend signiﬁcantly on nonrelatives for food, clothing,
medicine, protection, and shelter. In cities, most of these nonrelatives
crucial to our survival are complete strangers. Nature knows no other
examples of such complex mutual dependence among strangers. A divi-
sion of labor occurs, it is true, in some other species, such as the social
insects, but chieﬂy among close relatives—the workers in a beehive or
an ant colony are sisters. There are some cases of apparent coopera-
tion between colonies of ants founded by unrelated queens, though the
explanation of this phenomenon remains controversial.7 There is little
controversy, however, about the comparative ease with which the evolu-
tion of cooperation between close relatives can be explained: the mech-
anism is known as the theory of kin selection.8 This theory has shown
that cooperation through a division of labor between close genetic rel-
atives is likely to be favored by natural selection, since close relatives
share a high proportion of genes, including mutant genes, both good and
bad.9 But for a systematic cooperative division of labor to evolve among
genetically unrelated individuals would be very surprising indeed, since
individuals with mutant genes favoring dispositions to cooperate would
help others who had no such dispositions and oﬀered nothing in return.
And sure enough, cooperation through an elaborate division of labor
between unrelated individuals has never evolved in any species other
than man.
Some species, it is true, practice a small degree of cooperation between
unrelated individuals on very precise tasks.10 It has been seen among
sticklebacks, vampire bats, and lions, for example—albeit only in very

Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition • 5
small groups.11 But these rudiments bear as much relation to the elab-
orate human division of labor between relatives, nonrelatives, and com-
plete strangers as do the hunting calls of chimpanzees to the highly
structured human languages spoken all over the globe. Nature is also
full of examples of mutual dependence between diﬀerent species—such
as that between sharks and cleaner ﬁsh (this is known as symbiosis).12
But members of the same species occupy the same environment, eat
the same food, and—especially—pursue the same sexual opportunities;
they are rivals for all of these things in a much more intense way than
are members of diﬀerent species. Nowhere else in nature do unrelated
members of the same species—genetic rivals incited by instinct and his-
tory to ﬁght one another—cooperate on projects of such complexity and
requiring such a high degree of mutual trust as human beings do.
No solution to this puzzle can be found in evolutionary biology alone.
Ten thousand years is too short a time for the genetic makeup of Homo
sapiens sapiens to have adapted comprehensively to its new social sur-
roundings. If it were somehow possible to assemble together all your
direct same-sex ancestors—your father and your father’s father and so
on if you’re male, your mother and your mother’s mother and so on
if you’re female; one for each generation right back to the dawn of
agriculture—you and all of these individuals could ﬁt comfortably in
a medium-sized lecture hall.13 Only half of you would have known the
wheel, and only 1 per cent of you the motor car. But you would be far
more similar to each other—genetically, physically, and instinctually—
than any group of modern men or women who might have assembled
there by chance. It is true that a number of important genes have become
widespread in human populations due to unusually strong selective
pressures over the last ten millennia: examples include genes for resis-
tance to malaria in regions where that disease is endemic, for fair skin
and hair in northwestern Europe, where sunlight is scarce, and for lac-
tose tolerance—the ability to digest milk—in adults in parts of the world
where cattle and sheep were domesticated earliest.14 It is even likely
that the speed of human genetic evolution has been substantially faster
over the last ten millennia than it was beforehand, if only because we
have faced such challenging variations in our environments during that
time.15 Our bodies have also been profoundly aﬀected by improved
nutrition and other environmental developments over the centuries. Still,
except in some dimensions such as height and perhaps in skin color, the
biological diﬀerences between you and your furthest ancestor would be
hard to distinguish from random variation within the group. If you are

6 • Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition
reading this book in a train or an airplane, this means your most distant
ancestor from Neolithic times was probably more like you, biologically,
than the stranger sitting in the seat next to you now.
Yet evolutionary biology has something important to tell us all the
same. For the division of labor among human beings has had to piggy-
back on a physiology and a psychology that evolved to meet a far dif-
ferent set of ecological problems. These were problems faced by hunter-
gatherers, mainly on the African woodland savannah, over the six or
seven million years that separate us from our last common ancestor
with chimpanzees and bonobos. Some time in the last two hundred thou-
sand years or so—less than one-thirtieth of that total span—a series of
changes, minuscule to geneticists, vast in the space of cultural potential,
occurred to make human beings capable of abstract, symbolic thought
and communication.16 Just when they occurred involves diﬃcult issues
of dating,17 but since all human beings share these capacities the genetic
changes that made them happen probably occurred at least 140,000
years ago. But the ﬁrst evidence of the new cultural capabilities to which
they gave rise is found in the cave paintings, grave goods, and other
symbolic artifacts left by hunter-gatherer communities of anatomically
modern man (Cro-Magnon man, as he is sometimes known), which are no
older than sixty or seventy thousand years—and most are much younger.
These capabilities seem to have made a move toward agriculture and
settlement possible once the environmental conditions became favor-
able, after the end of the last ice age. Indeed, the fact that agriculture
was independently invented at least seven times, at close intervals, in
diﬀerent parts of the world suggests it was more than possible; it may
even have been in some way inevitable.18 These capabilities also enabled
human beings to construct the social rules and habits that would con-
strain their own violent and unreliable instincts enough to make society
possible on a larger, more formal scale. And they laid the foundation for
the accumulation of knowledge that would provide humanity as a whole
with a reservoir of shared skills vastly greater than the skills available to
any single person. But these cultural capabilities did not evolve because
of their value in making the modern division of labor possible. Quite the
contrary: modern society is an opportunistic experiment, founded on a
human psychology that had already evolved before human beings ever
had to deal with strangers in any systematic way. It is like a journey to the
open sea by people who have never yet had to adapt to any environment
but the land.

The Argument of This Book
The chapters that follow explore what made this remarkable experiment
possible and why, against all the odds, it did not collapse. They also
explore why it could collapse in the future, and what might be done to
prevent that from happening. Part I shows why the division of labor is
such a challenge for us to explain. It looks at the way in which even
some of the simplest activities of modern society depend upon intri-
cate webs of international cooperation that function without anyone’s
being in overall charge. On the contrary, they work through eliciting
a single-mindedness from their participants—a tunnel vision—that is
hardly compatible with a clear and nonpartisan vision of the priorities
of society as a whole. It seems hard to believe that something as com-
plex as a modern industrial society could possibly work at all without an
overall guiding intelligence, but since the work of the economist Adam
Smith in the eighteenth century, we have come to realize that this is
exactly how things are. Like medical students studying the human body,
therefore, we have to understand and marvel at the degree of sponta-
neous coordination displayed in human societies before we can even
begin to investigate its pathologies. This coordination comes about sim-
ply because of a willingness of individuals to cooperate with strangers
in a multitude of small but collectively very signiﬁcant ways.
Part II looks at what makes such cooperation possible, given the
psychology we have inherited from our hunter-gatherer ancestors. The
answer consists of institutions—sets of rules for social behavior, some
formal, many informal—that build on the instincts of the shy, murder-
ous ape in ways that make life among strangers not only survivable but
attractive, potentially even luxurious. These rules of behavior have made
it possible for us to deal with strangers by persuading us, in eﬀect, to
treat them as honorary friends. Some of the institutions that make this
possible have been consciously and coherently designed, but many have
grown by experiment or as the by-product of attempts to achieve some-
thing quite diﬀerent. Nobody can claim they are the “best” institutions
that human beings could ever devise. They are simply the ones that hap-
pen to have been tried, and that, given the psychology and physiology
of the creatures that tried them, happen to have survived and spread.19
The explanation begins by showing how the division of labor can create
great beneﬁts for those societies that can make it work. These beneﬁts
come mainly from specialization, the sharing of risk, and the accumula-
tion of knowledge. But advantages to society as a whole cannot explain

8 • Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition
why a division of labor evolved. We also need to understand why indi-
viduals have an interest in participating. A division of labor needs to be
robust against opportunism—the behavior of those who seek to beneﬁt
from the eﬀorts of others without contributing anything themselves. In
other words, participants need to be able to trust each other—especially
those they do not know. This is particularly important as the cost of mis-
placed trust can be high—the loss not only of economic resources but
of our lives. As the chapters of part II describe, our most deadly preda-
tors on the African woodland savanna were not the big carnivores but
other human beings20; levels of daily violence were dramatically higher
than they are in almost all parts of the modern world. We are the descen-
dants of those whose cunning and judgment helped them to survive this
murderous environment, so it is hardly surprising if our inherited psy-
chology sometimes sits uncomfortably with our high-minded ideals.
Nevertheless, social cooperation has been built, and on a scale unimag-
inable to our ancestors. It has done so through robust institutions: robust
in that those who operate within them can be trusted to do what others
expect them to do. Given the facts of human psychology, these institu-
tions ensure that cooperation not only happens but is reliable enough
for others to be willing to take its presence for granted, at least most of
the time. One such robust human institution will be described in detail:
it is the institution of money. Another is the banking system. We shall
look at the foundations of trust in ﬁnancial institutions, and examine the
delicate balance between the natural incentives of individuals to signal
their trustworthiness to others and the need for outside supervision to
enforce trust. Eﬀective institutions rely on a minimum of outside super-
vision, knowing that a little outside supervision can make natural incen-
tives go a long way.
As the recent ﬁnancial crisis has painfully reminded us, such trust in
institutions can often be seriously misplaced. So what went wrong in
the recent banking crisis? The answer is that what went wrong was an
understandable consequence of what, in most circumstances, goes right.
An eﬀective banking system allows most people, most of the time, not
to worry about what is happening to their savings, to leave judgments
about risk to others. Like an autopilot, it allows people not to pay atten-
tion even when they have a lot at stake. That’s a very good thing: in
the complex modern world we would be overwhelmed if we really tried
to pay attention to every possible risk to our security and our prosper-
ity. But also, like an autopilot, an eﬀective banking system can lull even
those who are supposed to be on duty into nodding on the watch. In

Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition • 9
the end there was a banking crisis because too many people placed too
much faith other people’s judgments about risk,21 even though trusting
other people’s judgments about risk—up to a point—is exactly what the
banking system allows us to do.
The rest of part II develops this idea that human cooperation depends
on our adopting a kind of tunnel vision. Not only does widespread social
trust arise in spite of the limitations of people’s individual perspectives,
but it even requires tunnel vision in order to persist. This is because the
most eﬀective mechanisms for ensuring trust rely not just on incentives
but on people’s internalization of values through education and training.
This process entrenches commitment to professional values and at the
same time makes them resistant to change. Codes of personal behavior
and professional ethics can therefore make individual acts of local coop-
eration more reliable, while generating a degree of systematic blindness
to the more distant consequences of our actions. Such blindness—tunnel
vision—has dangers that are a natural by-product of its inherent virtues.
Part II has therefore argued that we can understand why human beings
have proved capable of cooperating with strangers, thanks to institutions
that build on their already evolved hunter-gatherer psychology. Part III
goes on to look at global consequences—at what happens when human
beings equipped with this psychology, and responding to the presence
of these institutions, come together in the mass. Our mutual interdepen-
dence has produced eﬀects that utterly surpass what any of the partic-
ipants can have intended or sometimes even imagined. The growth of
cities, the despoliation of the environment, the sophisticated function-
ing of markets, the growth of large corporations, and the development
of stocks of collective knowledge in the form of science and technology:
all are part of the landscape of human interaction even though nobody
has planned them to look the way they do, and all have contributed
to the dramatic historical improvement in the prosperity of mankind.
But since nobody has planned them, we should not be surprised that
while some of them look encouraging, others look very troubling indeed.
For instance, the growth of cities—the result of countless uncoordinated
individual decisions about where to live and work—has led to some of
history’s most creative and innovative environments. It has also pro-
duced pollution and disease on an unprecedentedly concentrated scale.
Cities themselves have often been able to organize collective action to
overcome these by-products of their aﬄuence, but only by living oﬀa
hinterland whose resources they exploit and to which they export their
waste. But the world as a whole cannot do as cities have done, for it has no

10 • Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition
hinterland. The example of water, which we shall look at in detail, shows
us that problems of global pollution and resource depletion will prove
extremely dangerous unless we can ﬁnd ways of calculating and account-
ing for the cost of the resources we use and the pollution we cause. For
this we need to draw on one of the other great unintended characteristics
of modern society: the capacity of markets to calculate prices that sum-
marize the information necessary for allocating resources in a world of
scarcity. Markets, when they work well, have a remarkable ability to allow
their participants—who may never even physically meet—to pool infor-
mation about the scarcity of the goods and services they are exchanging.
It is precisely this kind of information that we need in order to treat our
limited environmental resources wisely.
Nevertheless, there are other aspects of the division of labor that mar-
kets on their own cannot eﬀectively coordinate. Many kinds of produc-
tive activity take place inside ﬁrms, which represent islands of plan-
ning and coordination—often also between strangers—in the sea of
unplanned market transactions around them. What makes some activ-
ities suitable for large ﬁrms, whose members are more anonymous to
each other, while others are suitable for small ﬁrms? The answer is that
successful ﬁrms adapt to their economic environment by channeling
information between people in a way that market transactions cannot
do. Information, and the spectacular accumulation of knowledge across
the centuries, is another of the remarkable by-products of modern soci-
ety: how has it happened, what are its beneﬁts, and what are its dan-
gers? Finally, the last chapter in part III explores the paradox that a
society whose members are interconnected as never before can never-
theless exclude some of its most vulnerable members—the unemployed,
the poor, the sick.
So, although part III will give us many reasons to be impressed by
the achievements of modern society, it will also show us urgent reasons
for concern. The persistence of desperate poverty in a world of plenty,
the destruction of the world’s environmental assets, and the spread of
weapons of large- and small-scale destruction (resulting from the diﬀu-
sion of information into the hands of those who would use it for aggres-
sive ends) all call for conscious reﬂection on solutions, using that same
capacity for abstract reasoning that has created so many of the prob-
lems in the ﬁrst place. So part IV looks at the institutions of collective
action—states, communities, and other political entities—and considers
their virtues and their weaknesses in the face of the need to design col-
lective solutions to the common problems of our species. At ﬁrst, it may

Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition • 11
look as though we have abundant reasons to be optimistic. For while
part III indicated the daunting scale of these common problems, part II
has already shown us that the emotional and cognitive capacities for
cooperation, and for rational reﬂection on the proper uses to make of
that cooperation, have a solid foundation in human evolution.
Unfortunately, however, the human capacity for cooperation is double-
edged. It is not only the foundation of social trust and peaceful living but
also what makes for the most successful acts of aggression between one
group and another. Like chimpanzees, though with more deadly reﬁne-
ment, human beings are distinguished by their ability to harness the
virtues of altruism and solidarity, and the skills of rational reﬂection, to
the end of making brutal and eﬃcient warfare against rival groups. What
modern society needs, therefore, is not more cooperation but better-
directed forms of cooperation. The book concludes by asking just how
optimistic we can reasonably be, knowing that some of the very quali-
ties that have made the great experiment of modern life possible are also
those that now threaten its very existence. Just how fragile is the great
experiment on which our species set out ten thousand years ago? And
what can we do to make it less fragile now?
Understanding the delicacy of our social institutions and their roots in
our evolutionary past helps us to think constructively about the press-
ing problems of the world today. Take globalization—one of those rare
abstract nouns that can bring people out marching in the streets in their
hundreds of thousands. The anxieties provoked by globalization are not
new but have been with us for ten thousand years—anxieties about pow-
erful individuals and groups of whom we know little but who may intend
to do us harm or who may undermine our security and our prosperity
even if they have no intentions toward us of any kind. Terrorism, too, is a
modern name for a phenomenon that provokes in us an age-old fear: that
among our enemies are numbered not only those who bear us personal
grudges but also those who do not know us or even care about us as
individuals at all. Living with these fears requires us to deploy abstract
reasoning in the service of institution-building, today as throughout the
last ten thousand years. As our world has grown more complex, we now
have to do more than create the simple local marketplaces where the ﬁrst
strangers could meet in enough security to justify the risk of dealing with
each other. We have to create a marketplace where tribes, corporations,
and whole nations can meet in relative security and do the deals that
underpin their collective prosperity. But though the scale of the chal-
lenges has grown, they retain much of their old character. And the last

12 • Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition
ten millennia have shown repeatedly how those who have not learned
from their history may never notice their deﬁciency until, fatally, they
are pitted against adversaries who have.
The argument of this book rests, therefore, on four pillars:
• First, the unplanned but sophisticated coordination of modern
industrial societies is a remarkable fact that needs an explanation.
Nothing in our species’ biological evolution has shown us to have
any talent or taste for dealing with strangers.
• Second, this explanation is to be found in the presence of institu-
tions that make human beings willing to treat strangers as honorary
friends.
• Third, when human beings come together in the mass, the unin-
tended consequences are sometimes startlingly impressive, some-
times very troubling.
• Fourth, the very talents for cooperation and rational reﬂection that
could provide solutions to our most urgent problems are also the
source of our species’ terrifying capacity for organized violence
between groups. Trust between groups needs as much human inge-
nuity as trust between individuals.
How This Book Draws on Recent Research
This book draws together a large range of ﬁndings by scholars working
in history, biology, anthropology, and, especially, economics and eco-
nomic history. The outline of the story told here is not new and in many
respects has been part of the shared understanding of economists since
the work of Adam Smith in the eighteenth century. But the growing spe-
cialization of disciplines has meant that many people outside profes-
sional economics have not realized how directly our subject speaks to
the past and the future of our human species. We are believed to deal
only in the rational skeleton of human life and to avoid addressing the
ﬂesh and blood it bears. At the same time, some scholars working within
economics are surprised to discover how starkly and expressively the
writings of other disciplines illustrate the dilemmas that we have been
in the habit of studying in our often somewhat bloodless way.
To help bridge this gap I have chosen to discuss economic arguments
using as little economic terminology as possible and citing evidence
drawn mainly from outside economics—from history, biology, and other
sources, including literary ones. The endnotes are designed not just to

Trust and Panic: Introduction to the Revised Edition • 13
support the claims made in the text but also to give sources and sug-
gestions for further reading. While the book’s individual chapters are
designed to be read as self-contained essays, the prologues to parts II,
III, and IV situate the chapters to come within a structured argument. Epi-
logues at the end of these parts link the themes that have been discussed
to the more formal literature of economics. They oﬀer suggestions for
further reading to those who would like to see the economic arguments
made more explicit, to see the logical skeleton under the ﬂesh.
Finally, although this book examines the evolutionary origins of our
psychology, it is not a work of evolutionary psychology as this is
commonly understood—meaning one that advances a set of particu-
lar hypotheses about the way our current behavior exempliﬁes psycho-
logical traits that evolved during our hunter-gatherer existence, hypothe-
ses associated with such scholars as Leda Cosmides and John Tooby,
some of whose research will be discussed in what follows.22 Although
Darwin was clearly right when he wrote that “man still bears in his bod-
ily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin,” we still know little
about exactly how our lowly origin constrains our behavior today. Two
facts stand out to a neutral observer about the behavior of Homo sapi-
ens sapiens: ﬁrst, we are a species of social primate, and speciﬁcally a
great ape. Most social primates live in environments characterized by
sophisticated cooperation within groups and simultaneously by intense
competition between groups, as well as competition between individu-
als for the privilege of belonging to the most powerful groups. Though
there is much variety in human behavior today, it would be astonish-
ing if many of the ingredients of a primate psychology necessary for
navigating such an environment had not survived in our modern brains.
However, the second striking fact about our behavior is that we have
shown ourselves capable of learning a whole new way of social living
since those modern brains evolved. This doesn’t just mean that we have
built a new environment populated by strangers; it means that our most
basic behavioral responses to others are diﬀerent from what they were
in the late Pleistocene world. I don’t have to ﬁght back an instinctive
terror before asking a stranger for a meal in a restaurant, nor do I have
to restrain myself by an eﬀort of will from clubbing the waiter to death
once his back is turned so I can seize the meal without paying. He just
meekly serves me the meal and I just meekly pay the bill. Just how many
other new tricks our old primate brains are capable of learning is one of
the remaining mysteries to be tackled by modern psychological research.

Who’s in Charge?
The World’s Need for Shirts
This morning I went out and bought a shirt. There is nothing very
unusual in that: across the world, perhaps 20 million people did the
same. What is more remarkable is that I, like most of these 20 million,
had not informed anybody in advance of what I was intending to do. Yet
the shirt I bought, although a simple item by the standards of modern
technology, represents a triumph of international cooperation. The cot-
ton was grown in India, from seeds developed in the United States; the
artiﬁcial ﬁber in the thread comes from Portugal and the material in the
dyes from at least six other countries; the collar linings come from Brazil,
and the machinery for the weaving, cutting, and sewing from Germany;
the shirt itself was made up in Malaysia. The project of making a shirt
and delivering it to me in Toulouse has been a long time in the planning,
since well before the morning two winters ago when an Indian farmer
ﬁrst led a pair of ploughing bullocks across his land on the red plains
outside Coimbatore. Engineers in Cologne and chemists in Birmingham
were involved in the preparation many years ago. Most remarkably of
all, given the obstacles it has had to surmount to be made at all and the
large number of people who have been involved along the way, it is a very
stylish and attractive shirt (for what little my judgment in these matters
may be worth). I am extremely pleased at how the project has turned
out. And yet I am quite sure nobody knew that I was going to be buying
a shirt of this kind today; I hardly knew it myself even the day before.
Every single one of these people who has been laboring to bring my shirt
to me has done so without knowing or indeed caring anything about me.
To make their task even more challenging, they, or people very much like
them, have been working at the same time to make shirts for all of the
other 20 million people of widely diﬀerent sizes, tastes, and incomes,
scattered over six continents, who decided independently of each other

18 • Chapter 1
to buy shirts at the same time as I did. And those were just today’s
clients. Tomorrow there will be another 20 million—perhaps more.
If there were any single person in overall charge of the task of sup-
plying shirts to the world’s population, the complexity of the challenge
facing them would call to mind the predicament of a general ﬁghting a
war. One can imagine an incoming president of the United States being
presented with a report entitled The World’s Need for Shirts, trembling at
its contents, and immediately setting up a Presidential Task Force. The
United Nations would hold conferences on ways to enhance international
cooperation in shirt-making, and there would be arguments over whether
the United Nations or the United States should take the lead. The pope
and the archbishop of Canterbury would issue calls for everyone to pull
together to ensure that the world’s needs were met, and committees of
bishops and pop stars would periodically remind us that a shirt on one’s
back is a human right. The humanitarian organization Couturiers sans
Frontières would airlift supplies to sartorially challenged regions of the
world. Experts would be commissioned to examine the wisdom of mak-
ing collars in Brazil for shirts made in Malaysia for re-export to Brazil.
More experts would suggest that by cutting back on the wasteful variety
of frivolous styles it would be possible to make dramatic improvements
in the total number of shirts produced. Factories which had achieved the
most spectacular increases in their output would be given awards, and
their directors would be interviewed respectfully on television. Activist
groups would protest that “shirts” is a sexist and racist category and pro-
pose gender- and culture-neutral terms covering blouses, tunics, cholis,
kurtas, barongs, and the myriad other items that the world’s citizens
wear above the waist. The columns of newspapers would resound with
arguments over priorities and needs. In the cacophony I wonder whether
I would still have been able to buy my shirt.
In fact there is nobody in charge. The entire vast enterprise of supply-
ing shirts in thousands and thousands of styles to millions and millions
of people takes place without any overall coordination at all. The Indian
farmer who planted the cotton was concerned only with the price this
would subsequently fetch from a trader, the cost to him of all the materi-
als, and the eﬀort he would have to put in to realize an adequate harvest.
The managers of the German machinery ﬁrm worry about export orders
and their relations with their suppliers and their workforce. The manu-
facturers of chemical dyes could not care less about the aesthetics of my
shirt. True, there are certain parts of the operation where there is sub-
stantial explicit coordination: a large company like ICI or Coats Viyella

Who’s in Charge? • 19
has many thousands of employees working directly or indirectly under
a chief executive. But even the largest such company accounts for only a
tiny fraction of the whole activity involved in the supply of shirts. Over-
all there is nobody in charge. We grumble sometimes about whether the
system works as well as it could (I have to replace broken buttons on my
shirts more often than seems reasonable). What is truly astonishing is
that it works at all.1
Citizens of the industrialized market economies have lost their sense
of wonder at the fact that they can decide spontaneously to go out in
search of food, clothing, furniture, and thousands of other useful, attrac-
tive, frivolous, or life-saving items, and that when they do so, somebody
will have anticipated their actions and thoughtfully made such items
available for them to buy. For our ancestors who wandered the plains in
search of game, or scratched the earth to grow grain under a capricious
sky, such a future would have seemed truly miraculous, and the possibil-
ity that it might come about without the intervention of any overall con-
trolling intelligence would have seemed incredible. Even when adventur-
ous travelers opened up the ﬁrst trade routes and the citizens of Europe
and Asia ﬁrst had the chance to sample each other’s luxuries, their safe
arrival was still so much subject to chance and nature as to make it a
source of drama and excitement as late as Shakespeare’s day. (Imagine
setting The Merchant of Venice in a supermarket.)
In Eastern Europe and the countries that used to belong to the Soviet
Union, even after the collapse of their planning systems, there has been
persistent and widespread puzzlement that any society could aspire to
prosperity without an overall plan. About two years after the break-up of
the Soviet Union I was in discussion with a senior Russian oﬃcial whose
job it was to direct the production of bread in St. Petersburg. “Please
understand that we are keen to move towards a market system,” he told
me. “But we need to understand the fundamental details of how such a
system works. Tell me, for example: who is in charge of the supply of
bread to the population of London?” There was nothing naive about his
question, because the answer (“nobody is in charge”), when one thinks
carefully about it, is astonishingly hard to believe. Only in the industri-
alized West have we forgotten just how strange it is.
Cooperation with Nobody in Charge
This book is about the human capacities that have made such coop-
eration possible, about their advantages and their dangers. One way to

20 • Chapter 1
capture their paradoxical quality is to think of them as embodying a kind
of tunnel vision. By “tunnel vision” I mean the capacity to play one’s part
in the great complex enterprise of creating the prosperity of a modern
society without knowing or necessarily caring very much about the over-
all outcome. We may be—and often are—interested in broader questions
about the point and purpose of it all, but the answers to such questions
have comparatively little eﬀect on our ability to do our jobs well. Our
activities are part of a network; we can play our part just by knowing how
to behave toward our neighbors in the network. Sometimes we rational-
ize this to ourselves by thinking that someone else is taking care of the
network as a whole; if so, we are usually mistaken.
Tunnel vision is not the same thing as the proﬁt motive, though a
concern for proﬁt to the exclusion of all else is one rather unattrac-
tive form that tunnel vision can take. Nor is it the same as self-interest.
Economists have often found it convenient to assume that individuals
are purely self-interested, if only to contrast the egoism of their motiva-
tion with the unwitting beneﬁts created for others by the pursuit of that
motivation. In truth human motivation is much richer than this simpliﬁ-
cation allows—but it cannot escape tunnel vision even so. We all have a
strong component of self-interest, and we also care about other things:
the welfare of our families and friends, the physical and moral health
of our communities, the future of our world. Sometimes this concern
expresses itself in strong views about the way in which the production
or distribution of economic resources should be organized, as when we
protest against the closure of a local hospital. But the altruism of our
gesture is no guarantee that we have thought through its wider impli-
cations: single-minded obsessiveness can be just as prevalent among
those whose goals are not narrowly selﬁsh ones, such as crusaders for a
charitable cause, as among proﬁt-oriented businessmen. More often, we
neither know nor care very much about the details. If I work in a furniture
factory, it is more important to me to have a good working environment,
pleasant colleagues, and reasonable pay than to know how the furni-
ture I produce will be used to decorate the homes of those who buy it. I
may, of course, derive job satisfaction from understanding how my work
contributes to the activities and aspirations of others. People can often
strengthen their sense of their own worth by understanding how their
work ﬁts into some larger frame of things; this was an important message
of the book Working, in which the American writer Studs Terkel inter-
viewed people from all corners of life to ﬁnd out how their jobs aﬀected
them.2 But Terkel’s book also showed how solitary this satisfaction can

Who’s in Charge? • 21
be for many people in modern occupations; it may aﬀect their happiness
without making much diﬀerence to the quality of their work. It is both
an admirable and a melancholy fact that training and the standardiza-
tion of working methods are designed to reduce the impact of personal
idiosyncrasy on the job.3
Tunnel vision, then, covers a range of states of mind, from a mere
capacity for detachment at one end to an obsessive single-mindedness
at the other. As we shall see in later chapters, our understanding of
the way modern economies work shows us two things. First, that mod-
ern society needs tunnel vision: the prosperity that the world’s citizens
rightly demand rests upon institutions that are not only compatible with
tunnel vision but even encourage it. Secondly, that tunnel vision is also
dangerous: it is the source of many of the gravest threats to our secu-
rity and happiness. How can this be? To begin uncovering the answer we
must go back to shirts.
How should we react when we ask about some activity—“Who’s in
charge?”—and receive the answer “No one”? It clearly depends on what
kind of activity is in question. If I were an airline passenger, I would be
concerned to discover that no one was in charge of the airplane. But it
is good to know there is nobody in charge of creating modern English
poetry. What is surprising is that supplying shirts to the world is—in this
respect—closer to poetry than to piloting an aircraft. Why? What explains
why these diﬀerent activities provoke these particular responses?
The details of the answer will occupy most of this book. But here’s a
start. First of all, the passengers in an aircraft share more or less the same
clear goal: they want to get to their destination quickly and, above all,
safely. Some of them may be more willing than others to travel slowly to
avoid turbulence, but compared with the overriding shared goal of safe
arrival, all diﬀerences of emphasis between them are minor. Secondly,
in the event of danger all the passengers and crew are in the same—as it
were—boat. If I don’t like the way the left-hand side of the aircraft is tilt-
ing, I can’t just go and sit on the right. The right-hand side of the aircraft
will be traveling in the same direction as the left. In other words, the
activities and fates of the passengers are interconnected in an inextrica-
ble way: such interconnections may make tunnel vision quite dangerous.
However, some of this interconnection of our destinies may actually be
welcome: if I don’t have a parachute, I shall be somewhat reassured to
know that the pilot doesn’t have one either.
Thirdly, there is enough uncertainty in the aircraft’s environment
to make us unwilling to trust any purely mechanical set of rules for

22 • Chapter 1
coordinating its ﬂight—such as those embodied in the autopilot. Even
sophisticated ﬂy-by-wire technologies can cope only with conditions pre-
cise enough for the programmers to foresee in detail, but there are oth-
ers (such as the failure of the autopilot itself) where only the presence of
someone in charge will do. The relative importance of the unforeseeable
explains why there are driverless trains but not yet pilotless passenger
airplanes,∗and this diﬀerence is signiﬁcant for many aspects of social
life.
Fourthly, although being in charge of an aircraft is a complex responsi-
bility that requires considerable training and experience, it is still simple
enough for one person to be capable of discharging it in most circum-
stances. This is because of the relative simplicity of the overall goal, the
limited number of controls to be operated, the limited number of ways
of operating them, and the relatively limited number of signals to which
the operator needs to respond. The job of being in charge is within a
single individual’s capacity.
These four features together imply that the task of ﬂying the aircraft
is simple enough for one person but too complex and unforeseeable
for a machine. (There are many such tasks—cleaning a hotel room and
weeding a ﬂowerbed, to name but two.) But why does this mean one
person has to be in charge? Why can’t everyone be in charge together?
The moment one asks this question it becomes obvious what the answer
is: if backseat driving is a nuisance, backseat ﬂying is potentially disas-
trous. Trying to reach agreement on how to ﬂy the aircraft would involve
arguments and delays that the passengers, in their desire to reach their
destination safely, simply cannot aﬀord.
Creating poetry is very diﬀerent in a number of obvious ways, of which
only some matter for the question we are concerned with here. First of
all, there is no clear goal that poetry is trying to achieve, for all that
literary critics may try to impose an order upon it. That’s not just an
accident or an unfortunate omission: poetry would not be valuable if
it lost the subversive, unsettling quality of an activity whose goals are
always open to question and renewal. Individual poets who are not free to
reinvent and rediscover their own activity cease to be poets and become
speechwriters. If the poetry of any era or culture has a pattern, it is not

one that can be planned and imposed but one that emerges from the
interplay of many individual voices.
Secondly, because the voices are many and individual, the connections
between them are subtle and detachable. Poets inﬂuence each other, cer-
tainly; but if the poet laureate writes a bad poem, it’s a bad poem, not a
collective disaster.
Thirdly, even if there were reasons to wish to do so, being in charge
of a nation’s or a culture’s poetry is a task of such complexity that no
individual could discharge it except by simplifying it to a point of crudity.
That is why cultural commissars set up by dictatorships always begin by
giving themselves some clear task: poetry should aim to restore national
pride or uplift the toiling and exploited masses. Then they realize that
monitoring the pursuit of this task is going to be very diﬃcult if there
is no limit to the number of people who can write poetry, so the next
thing they do is to stipulate that all poets must be members of a writers’
union. Even without invoking any rights of free expression, it takes very
little imagination to see that commissars are bad for poetry.
There may also be a more subtle reason why a single individual could
not be in charge of a culture’s poetry. One reason why so few critics of art
or literature have also been great artists or writers is that the breadth and
ﬂexibility of vision that make a critic—the ability to see virtues in oppos-
ing styles and movements and to understand something of the roots
of their opposition—tends to be incompatible with the single-minded
energy that creates great works. Creativity seems to require more tunnel
vision than criticism can usually aﬀord.
What about the production of the world’s shirts? The goal of this activ-
ity cannot be summed up simply in the phrase “producing shirts.” The
quality, the design, the variety of styles, the durability of the cloth, and
the location of the diﬀerent people with their diﬀerent tastes represent
a whole array of dimensions along which decisions must be taken on
behalf of all the 20 million people a day who buy shirts—dimensions that
are at least as important as the sheer quantity of shirts produced. There
is no agreed-upon goal. This, incidentally, is a ﬁrst step toward under-
standing why the Soviet Union was able to achieve much more impressive
economic growth, relative to Western countries, in its early days, when
the priority was to produce items like coal, steel, and electricity and the
goals could be summed up relatively uncontroversially in quantitative
terms, than in its last decades, when the emphasis had switched toward
consumer goods. Chinese planners were more farsighted: the Mao jacket
simply imposed on consumer fashions the logic of coal and steel.

24 • Chapter 1
By comparison with the passengers in the aircraft, there is also very
little direct interconnection between the activities of all the world’s wear-
ers of shirts, other than that they are all participants in the market for
shirts. Shirts are quite diﬀerent in this respect from some other products:
if your power station pollutes the atmosphere in the course of producing
electricity, this has a direct eﬀect on everyone else and not just yourself,
but the chances are that you will ignore most of these eﬀects on oth-
ers when managing your power station. Modern life is full of instances
where the direct interactions between individuals mean that in pursuit
of their own goals all end up worse oﬀ. Consider:
• Everyone else drives to work, so the bus and rail services are infre-
quent, so I drive to work as well, and the roads are packed.
• Each side in the civil war fears the other side cannot be trusted to
keep the truce, so each side prepares to break the truce rather than
risk allowing the other side to ﬁre ﬁrst.
• Any secondhand car for sale must be of dubious quality, so worth
only a low price, but if used cars can only fetch a low price, only
cars of dubious quality will be oﬀered for sale.
• He drinks in an attempt to forget her inﬁdelity, and she is unfaithful
because he drinks.
• The owner of each trawler would prefer the ﬁsh stocks to be
allowed to regenerate, but each knows that one person’s restraint
will make no diﬀerence, so all of them ﬁsh heavily, and the stocks
decline.
• Each company hopes that a recession can be avoided, but just in
case it can’t, all of them cut back on their orders, so a recession
occurs.
Shirts are comparatively free of such interactions (though not entirely
free of them, as we shall see in chapter 2). You may be somewhat scornful
of my taste, but by and large this does not aﬀect your own ability to buy
and wear the shirts you prefer, and almost all the rest of the world’s
shirt-wearers could not care less what shirt I buy. It is true that it may
take only one photograph of a supermodel wearing a particular style of
shirt for there to be a surge in demand for it, but that surge will still
amount to no more than a ripple on the surface of the vast industry that
turns out shirts for the world as a whole, and we can be sure that the
supermodel will be photographed wearing a diﬀerent shirt tomorrow.
The sheer number and variety of shirts produced in the world is an
essential part of the reason why no single individual could be in charge.

Who’s in Charge? • 25
There are nearly 7 billion people in the world, and anyone who thinks it
is possible to imagine that number of people might reﬂect that 6 billion
is a little more than the number of postage stamps that could be laid end
to end around the equator, or the number of days it would take your hair
to grow from London to Casablanca. This vast number means that the
variety of needs and styles and tastes that the shirt-making industry has
to cater to lies far beyond the capacity of any individual to comprehend,
let alone to organize. As anyone who has worked in a large organization
knows, people who are put in charge of a complex activity that would be
better left alone never do nothing; they seek to justify their existence by
simplifying and restricting that activity so that it can be controlled. That
is what Soviet planners did: they created large ﬁrms, much larger than
any equivalent ﬁrms in the West, simply in order not to have to deal with
too many of them.
By contrast with the overwhelming nature of the problems that would
face an individual put in charge of global shirt production, each of us
can carry out our task of choosing a shirt fairly eﬀectively without out-
side guidance. A shirt is an item whose quality is more or less visible to
inspection before it is bought (whatever reservations one may have about
the quality of the buttons). This is more than can be said for medicines,
for instance, and indeed the inability of ordinary buyers to discern the
properties of a medicine just by looking at it is central to explaining why
we usually choose to delegate at least part of the responsibility for our
health to those more expert than ourselves.
Large numbers also help us to understand one of the most mysterious
features of a system with no one in charge: its apparent ability to antici-
pate my desire when I have done nothing to communicate that desire to
anyone. We may like to think of ourselves as individuals quite unlike oth-
ers, but in many respects our behavior is highly predictable. Partly this
is because of our biology: we have physical needs that are by and large
common to other members of our species. Social conventions also play a
part: nothing in our biology obliges us to have our meals when other peo-
ple are having theirs, but it makes life more pleasant if we do. But ﬁnally
it is the sheer number of us that makes our behavior predictable, for
large numbers of people tend under many conditions to behave in much
more regular ways than do any of the particular individuals of which
such crowds are composed. Statisticians of the early nineteenth century
were fascinated by the fact that even such profoundly personal actions
as suicide occurred in a suﬃciently regular way in large populations as
to be predictable within certain limits.4 And our more banal activities

26 • Chapter 1
of working, dressing, shopping, cooking, and traveling turn out, in the
mass, to display a regularity suﬃciently striking for whole centers of
productive activity to be based upon it. If I had not bought my shirt this
morning, somebody rather like me would very probably have bought it
within a few days. It is on that conjecture that my shirtmaker has built
a business.
These four factors—large numbers, great complexity, few direct inter-
connections between the actions of the diﬀerent buyers of shirts, and
a reasonable ability on the part of ordinary buyers to assess the qual-
ity of what they are buying—provide the beginning of an answer to our
earlier question: why is it a relief to know that no one is in charge of
making the world’s shirts? One of the great intellectual achievements
of modern economics has been to work out very precisely the circum-
stances under which decentralized systems of market exchange can pro-
duce results that are eﬃcient, in the sense of improving the condition
of every individual as far as possible whenever this can be done without
harming someone else. This deﬁnition of eﬃciency was originally pro-
posed by the Italian economist and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto and is now
known as Pareto-eﬃciency. The intellectual achievement of economics in
showing how and when market exchange can achieve Pareto-eﬃciency
is not the same thing as a practical achievement, for, as we shall see,
all real-life systems of market exchange fail to live up to these demand-
ing conditions, sometimes to a disturbing degree. But shirts are a pretty
good advertisement for decentralized market exchange. They are also
a remarkable reminder of how much of the pattern of modern life has
emerged without ever having been consciously willed by anyone.
Two Reasons for Doubt
Arguments such as these may still not be enough to remove a nagging
doubt. Can we be sure that shirt-making shows us the virtues of tunnel
vision rather than the vices of central control? Does the shirt-making
system really work so well? There are two serious grounds for wonder-
ing whether it works as well as it could. The ﬁrst is that, while the system
produces shirts well given the circumstances at any particular time, it
may be unstable across time. Swings of fashion and small divergences
between producers in their costs of production can result in large shifts
of demand away from some producers and in favor of others. In par-
ticular, the very internationalization of shirt production described at
the beginning of this chapter has led to the loss of many jobs in rich

Who’s in Charge? • 27
countries whose textile industries have been in steep decline for several
decades.5 Some years ago the Economist expressed vividly the anxiety
underlying this criticism on its front cover, which portrayed an ema-
ciated, poorly dressed, and dark-skinned man under the caption: “He
wants your job.” There is often much inconsistency (not to mention xeno-
phobia) in such sentiments, especially when they assert that other coun-
tries should buy our products without presuming to make any of their
own—as if they could aﬀord to do the one without also doing the other.
But there is also a potentially more serious and well-founded point. Even
though, on average, shirts made through international cooperation are
shirts that correspond better to what their wearers want, if the system
that creates them increases instability, that may be bad for everyone.
In former ages people faced major hazards aﬀecting their productive
abilities (mainly disease and the failure of the harvest). As these hazards
have declined, people face threats not so much to their ability to produce
as to their ability to sell what they have produced. In an internationally
integrated set of markets, people may develop their skills at produc-
ing good-quality shirts but ﬁnd that these skills have become worthless
because of unexpected shifts in the decisions of buyers on the other side
of the world.
So the growing international division of labor has certainly not re-
moved the threat of instability for those who make shirts, or grow food,
or build cars. But that does not mean it has increased instability relative
to some realistic alternative. The risks of disease and harvest failure are
much lower today in almost all parts of the world than they were a cen-
tury or two ago (the exceptions being parts of Africa). And we should
not underestimate how often farmers, traders, and artisans in preindus-
trial societies suﬀered from the collapse of the market for what they
produced.6 When markets were typically more local, fragmented, and
cut oﬀfrom the outside world than they are today, their failures did not
show up as world or even as national events. But they could be just as
catastrophic for the individuals caught in their wake. True, the instabil-
ity of some modern markets is indeed a serious problem for the world
economic system. But one reason it seems so serious is that a number
of problems that once seemed even larger now trouble us much less.
The second ground for dissent about the eﬀects of tunnel vision would
challenge my description of the system as delivering the shirts that wear-
ers want. A much more sinister interpretation is possible: the system
teaches wearers to want what the system can deliver. If I believe that I
can buy almost everything I want without traveling more than a short

28 • Chapter 1
distance from my home, that may only show how eﬀectively I have been
brainwashed, since it apparently never occurs to me to want something
I would have to travel further to get. In the 1950s Vance Packard’s pop-
ular and riveting book The Hidden Persuaders persuaded people that
they were in the grip of advertisers who were not only unscrupulous but
extraordinarily powerful. Advertisers were achieving in the West what
commissars were trying less successfully to do in the East.7
These two arguments, though sometimes made by the same people,
cannot be simultaneously right, at least not to any important degree. If
producers are capable of persuading the public to want whatever they
produce, they cannot at the same time be vulnerable to being deserted
by the public at any moment for the wares of a rival producer. This
same inconsistency pervades Naomi Klein’s inﬂuential book No Logo,
which claims that through the process of creating worldwide brands,
corporations have become all-powerful, but that they are at the same
time engaged in a desperate struggle to survive in the face of competition
from each other.8 Indeed, some of the examples she used to illustrate the
unassailable power of brands (such as Levi’s jeans) were already looking
weak even by the time her book was published.
Both of these arguments express a deep-rooted anxiety at the power-
lessness of individuals in the face of a large and anonymous world eco-
nomic system, and it is the fact that such powerlessness strikes a chord
among today’s citizens that has made Naomi Klein a millionaire. But the
two arguments give diﬀerent and incompatible accounts of that pow-
erlessness. The Hidden Persuaders told us we were powerless because
someone else had the power. The instability thesis tells us we are pow-
erless because no one has power. In fact, the instability thesis is a more
persuasive account of the dangers in tunnel vision, though we shall see
in later chapters that The Hidden Persuaders may also have an important
lesson for us. But for the time being let me return to shirts and reiterate
the simple message they illustrate. Even if tunnel vision has dangers, an
understanding of those dangers has to start with an explanation of the
remarkable fact that many thousands of productive and useful activities
work at all with no one in overall charge.
Is that really because of tunnel vision or in spite of it? Could it be that
they work because people are public-spirited, because they understand
what the system needs and do their best to contribute? The diﬃculty with
this suggestion is not the assumption that people may be public-spirited.
There is plenty of evidence that, in the right circumstances, people can
be persuaded to behave in very selﬂess ways. The real problem lies not

Who’s in Charge? • 29
with the idea that there is public spirit so much as with the assumption
that people have no diﬃculty knowing what public spirit requires. If the
shirt-making system as a whole is too hard for a single individual to
understand, it is no easier for each of a large number of people to do so.
The only reason why the system works better with no one in charge is
that each of the many individuals who contribute need worry about only
a small part of the task, and it is much easier to worry about a part than
to worry about the whole. The sense of being responsible for the whole
world could easily become a disabling burden.
The Role of Government
It may seem strange to suggest that no one is in charge, since we may well
wonder what politicians are for. Every country has a ﬁnance minister, or
a treasury secretary, or a chancellor, whose job it is to look after the
nation’s economy. There may be no one in charge of the world economy,
but that is because there is no world government. At the level of the
nation-state, one might think, it is surely clear who is in charge.
Yet is it really so clear? There is a lost look sometimes that ﬂits across
the brow of those senior politicians who have not managed to attain per-
fect facial self-control. It is the look of a small boy who has dreamed all
his life of being allowed to take the controls of an airplane, but who dis-
covers when at last he does that none of the controls he operates seems
to be connected to anything, or that they work in such an unpredictable
way that it is safer to leave them alone altogether. Politicians have very
little power, if by power we mean the capacity to achieve the goals they
had hoped and promised to achieve. Another such admission came from
the dismissed British chancellor Norman Lamont, who accused the gov-
ernment he had left (after the United Kingdom’s forced exit from the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992) of being “in oﬃce but not
in power.” He meant it as an accusation against a particular government,
but to a greater or lesser degree it characterizes the predicament of any
government of a complex modern society. It is a predicament that begins
at the most simple level of all, that of knowing what is happening around
us—for, as the economist Sir Josiah Stamp once observed, “the Govern-
ment are very keen on amassing statistics. They collect them, add them,
raise them to the nth power, take the cube root and prepare wonder-
ful diagrams. But you must never forget that every one of these ﬁgures
comes in the ﬁrst instance from the village watchman, who just puts
down what he damn well pleases.”9 Without eyes and ears of their own,

30 • Chapter 1
politicians are touchingly dependent on the cooperation of those they
supposedly govern. It is cooperation that precedes government and not
the other way round.
Politicians are in charge of a modern economy in much the same way
as a sailor is in charge of a small boat in a storm. The consequences
of their losing control completely may be catastrophic (as civil war and
hyperinﬂation in parts of the former Soviet empire have reminded us),
but even while they keep aﬂoat, their inﬂuence over the course of events
is tiny in comparison with that of the storm around them. We who are
their passengers may focus our hopes and fears upon them, and express
profound gratitude toward them if we reach harbor safely, but that is
chieﬂy because it seems pointless to thank the storm.
In Tolstoy’s novel War and Peace a similar thought is expressed about
Napoleon’s command of his army: “Napoleon, who is presented to us as
the leader of all this movement back and forwards (just as the ﬁgure-
head over the prow of the ship seems to the savage to be the power
directing the vessel in its course)—Napoleon in whatever he did through-
out this period was like a child holding on to the straps inside a carriage
and imagining that he is driving it.”10 Tolstoy’s entire novel is an attempt
to overturn the simple vision of leaders as controlling what happens in
the organizations and societies they lead, an insight that explains why
the novel can seem so startlingly modern in its vision even a century and
a half after it was written.
Politicians’ inability to control events is not an accidental and regret-
table feature of modern society. It is a consequence of the very complex-
ity and the consequent tunnel vision that have given us both the rewards
and the dangers of prosperity in its modern form, in the same way as
storms are an inevitable danger once a boat leaves port and heads for
the open sea. Many of the most anguished debates over the way soci-
ety should be organized have turned upon the choice between the often
irreconcilable attractions of the port and the open sea. The eternal veri-
ties of the countryside versus the adventure and decadence of the city;
the virtues of national self-suﬃciency versus the rewards of integration
into the world economy; the security of traditional forms of order and
community versus the ﬂexibility and lack of constraint implicit in moder-
nity: these tensions are too deeply rooted in humanity to be resolved
simply by a bold declaration in favor of one or the other pole. Politicians
who declare in favor of one or the other may ride a temporary wave but
risk an eventual turn of the tide: in the case of Marxism, the wave lasted
half a century, with help from the secret police, while its successor liberal

Who’s in Charge? • 31
democracy is only two decades old in the former Soviet empire and the
nationalist tide is gathering force. Nationalism is, after all, just tunnel
vision with costumes and ﬂags, but it is driven principally by a fear of
the anonymous open sea.
It should by now be clear that this book is not a hymn to tunnel vision.
Tunnel vision is what makes it possible for all the participants in the
task of supplying the world’s need for shirts to respond to that need in
the many ways it expresses itself, without having continually to check
back to base; there is no base. But tunnel vision is also what makes it
possible for us to pollute the earth without thinking of the costs. Tunnel
vision is what enables a worker in a factory making land mines, and
a civil servant authorizing their export, not to think of themselves as
accessories to the murder of the small child who will step on the land
mine in ﬁve years’ time. Tunnel vision is what makes us all vulnerable
to the sudden disappearance of a market for those skills we have, with
much eﬀort, managed to build.
Tunnel vision in this sense is a skill (and a predicament) that was
unknown to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. It is a social rather than a
biological talent, though it channels powerful biological capacities, and
it has developed during the ten thousand or so years that separate us
from the ﬁrst farmers of the Neolithic era. Before we look at its conse-
quences for life in the modern world, it is important to consider why it
evolved at all.

Prologue to Part II
What makes trusting strangers a reasonable, instead of a suicidal, thing
to do? It’s not enough to show that societies in which people can trust
one another reap the beneﬁts of peace and prosperity on a scale unimag-
inable to our distant ancestors. They do, but trust would soon unravel if
individuals could enjoy the beneﬁts of other people’s cooperative behav-
ior while making no contribution of their own. Making mistakes about
the trustworthiness of others is not just costly but extremely dangerous,
and more so for human beings than for almost any other species. The
evidence that will be reviewed in part II suggests that, in the absence of
incentives to the contrary, human beings can behave so violently toward
one another that no sane person would trust others based on their nat-
ural dispositions alone. If we do so, it is because we have created struc-
tures of social life in which such judgments of trust make sense. Still,
the structures work—most of the time—because they do not run against
the grain of our natural dispositions but build on them in a constructive
way.
Two kinds of disposition have proved important to our evolution: a
capacity for rational calculation of the costs and beneﬁts of cooperation,
and a tendency for what has been called strong reciprocity—the willing-
ness to repay kindness with kindness and betrayal with revenge, even
when this is not what rational calculation would recommend. It is known
as “strong” reciprocity to distinguish it from the kind of reciprocity that
may just result from sophisticated rational calculation. Neither calcula-
tion nor strong reciprocity could support cooperation without the other.
People given only to calculation would be too opportunistic, so nobody
would trust them. People given to reciprocity without calculation would
be too easily exploited by others. It seems likely that natural selection
favored the evolution of a balance between these two dispositions in our
ancestors. It did so because such a balance was important to the devel-
opment of social life even before these ancestors ever began to deal with

34 • Prologue to Part II
strangers in any systematic way. But once the dispositions were there,
they could be put to work to make exchange between strangers possible.
In the chapters that follow we look at how the balance between strong
reciprocity and calculation underpins our social life. No social institution
can function on calculation alone, but well-designed social institutions
can make a little reciprocity go a long way. They do so, in eﬀect, by mak-
ing it reasonable for us to treat strangers as though they were honorary
relatives or friends. We frame rules for behavior toward strangers that
mimic the way we treat our family and our friends, and we reinforce
these rules by explicit systems of incentives, as well as by education
and training—an apprenticeship for social life that is designed to make
opportunistic behavior more uncomfortable for us. By training us to
follow the rules of social cooperation, this apprenticeship makes our
behavior reliable enough for others to count upon. At the same time,
and disturbingly, it reinforces our tunnel vision, giving us a power to
inﬂuence our world at a distance that exceeds our capacity to care much
of the time about the damage we can do, a power whose consequences
we shall explore more fully in part III.
The knowledge that most people can be trusted much of the time to
play their part in the complex web of social cooperation has had dramatic
eﬀects on the psychology of our everyday life. Our ancestors of twenty
thousand years ago have left no novels, diaries, or travelogues, but it
is a reasonable bet that when they moved across the plains of Africa
and Eurasia they did so cautiously, in small bands, taking care not to
expose themselves to those strangers they might occasionally hear or
see in the distance. Their brains had evolved under selective pressures
favoring caution and mistrust, since opportunistic murder and orga-
nized warfare were almost certainly at least as common among early
humans as they are among chimpanzees.1 Those brains were physically
almost indistinguishable from the brains of their descendants who are
alive today.2 Yet any one of these descendants may step nonchalantly
out of the front door of a suburban house and disappear into a city of
ten million strangers, every one of whom is as much his biological rival
as the strangers of whom his ancestors were so justly wary two hundred
centuries ago.

How Is Human Cooperation Possible?

Man and the Risks of Nature
Judging Chances
It is notoriously hard to make scientiﬁcally robust statements about
something as complex and multifaceted as human intelligence, and even
more so to compare the intelligence of diﬀerent groups. But here are two
statements we can be reasonably conﬁdent are true. First, over the course
of human evolution in the 6 or 7 million years since our last common
ancestor with chimpanzees and bonobos, children have been, on aver-
age, very slightly less intelligent than their parents. Secondly, over that
same period, each generations’s parents have been, also on average, very
slightly more intelligent than its grandparents.1
How can these statements both be true? Our parents are just the chil-
dren of our grandparents, after all. Here’s the explanation. Children bear
the genes of their parents in a random combination. This combination
might make them either more or less intelligent than their parents, but
there’s no reason to expect one outcome more than the other. When
averaged over the many billions of children who have ever been born,
combinations of parental genes can be expected to have the same intel-
ligence as the parental genes themselves. In addition, a very few chil-
dren will be the bearers of genetic mutations. A tiny fraction of these
genetic mutations will be favorable ones, enhancing the intelligence of
their bearers. But the overwhelming majority will be damaging, for the
same reason that a random blow delivered to a television set is much
more likely to damage it than to improve its reception. The combined
eﬀect of combination and mutation, again over billions of children, is to
bring the average intelligence of children to a level very slightly below
that of their parents.
What about our parents, who are the children of our grandparents? The
intelligence of our grandparents’ children will be slightly below that of
their parents, certainly, and for the same reasons. But our parents were
not just the randomly selected children of our grandparents’ generation;

38 • Chapter 2
they were the children who survived and succeeded in reproducing.
Given that they had survived to reproduce, those children were likely to
be slightly more intelligent than their own parents, and they would have
transmitted this slight advantage to their children in turn. This advan-
tage, though slight, would nevertheless have been large enough across
the population to outweigh the negative eﬀect of mutations. Again, this
is a statement about averages, one we know to be true since modern man
has a higher intelligence than the chimpanzee, even if it may not have
been true for any particular generation of the three hundred thousand
that separate us from our last common ancestor. There’s nothing partic-
ularly mysterious about this fact, nor does it indicate any kind of histori-
cal inevitability. It’s just that what we call intelligence is a mixed group of
mental capacities for anticipating and manipulating our environment—
precisely the capacities that, in the long run, tend to promote survival
and reproduction. Indeed, we can be more conﬁdent about the compari-
son of intelligence between humans and chimpanzees than we could ever
be about the comparison of intelligence between human beings, which
underlines the fact that our statement is about averages and not about
any given pair of generations.
This explanation not only encapsulates the essentials of the theory of
natural selection; it also makes use of the two most fundamental ideas in
statistics. The ﬁrst idea is embodied in the law of large numbers, which
states, roughly, that the average behavior of a large group of similar indi-
viduals will be more predictable than the behavior of a small group, or
of any one individual in that group. (It is sometimes known informally as
the law of averages.) Consider a seaside town whose citizens can choose
at the weekend between going to the beach, going to the park, and stay-
ing at home. On any particular weekend it may be very hard to predict
what one individual will do, but it is comparatively easy to predict, within
a reasonable margin, what proportion of citizens will choose each of the
three options. Any one individual may decide to go to the park, but for
the whole town to go to the park would require a massive and implau-
sible correlation between their individual decisions (implausible, that is,
unless they were all there for the Fourth of July parade). Similarly, over
the course of a whole year, if we try to predict what proportion of week-
ends any one individual might choose to go to the park, we would expect
a lot of variation between individuals, and our margin of error would be
large. If we try to predict the total proportion of the citizens who go to the
park over the whole year, the margin of error would be much smaller.
This is another way of saying that, if we decide how close to the true

Man and the Risks of Nature • 39
proportion our prediction has to be to count as successful, we will be
successful more often when predicting the behavior of all citizens than
when predicting the behavior of any one of them. Ice-cream sellers and
deck-chair attendants have a much more predictable future in a large
town than a small one.
The second statistical idea is known as conditional probability. If we
try to predict what proportion of a group will behave in a certain way,
our prediction will (and should) be sensitive to what other information
we have. We may know that, on average over the year, 5 per cent of the
town’s citizens go to the beach at the weekend. However, if we consider
just weekends in summer, that proportion rises to 10 per cent. If we con-
sider weekends on which the temperature rises above thirty degrees, the
proportion rises to 20 per cent. So, conditional on information about the
season or the temperature, the proportion of citizens going to the beach
is diﬀerent from the proportion we would calculate if we had no such
information. Likewise, if we know it is the Fourth of July, we will realize
that the town’s citizens are not behaving independently; that their behav-
ior is correlated—meaning that to ﬁnd them all at the park would not
require an extraordinary coincidence, just a peculiarity of the calendar.
We can also calculate probabilities conditional not on information
about external events but about a particular subgroup of people. For
example, the proportion of beachgoers among those citizens who can-
not swim is lower than among all citizens as a whole. Similarly, the aver-
age intelligence of children among those who survive to reproduce is
diﬀerent from the average among all children who are born.
The eﬀect of conditional probability depends on what unconditional
probabilities we start with. Knowing that it is a hot weekend in summer
makes us guess that 20 per cent of the population will go to the beach—
given that we started from a baseline of 5 per cent in the ﬁrst place. If
we had taken a diﬀerent town, miles from the sea, in which over the year
as a whole only 1 per cent go anywhere near a beach, our assessment
for a hot weekend in summer would have been much lower. This kind of
sensitivity to initial conditions notoriously bedevils medical diagnosis.
If you test positive for a fairly common disease on a test with 99 per cent
reliability, the chances are that you have the disease. If you test positive
on a test with the same reliability, but for an extremely rare condition,
the chances are overwhelmingly against your having the disease, even
though the probability is greater than it was before you took the test. This
is because the 99 per cent of people with the disease who are found by
the test may still be few in number compared to the 1 per cent of “false

40 • Chapter 2
positives” generated by the rest of the population. So if the disease is
rare, you are much more likely to be a false positive than a true one.2
Using the laws of statistics does not require a sophisticated mathe-
matical education: people and animals use the law of large numbers and
the idea of conditional probability all the time. They may not know they
are doing so, any more than a pool player necessarily knows he is using
mechanics and trigonometry. Fish swimming in schools for safety are
instinctively using the law of large numbers, while working with con-
ditional probability is central to animal survival. My predators are dis-
tributed across the savannah in such a way that if I wander around at
random, I shall come across a predator perhaps once a day. But if I make
an unnecessary sound or stand upwind of the waterhole, that frequency
will rise to a dangerous level. Not only does it help me to know this,
but I may even be able to manipulate the conditional probabilities in
my favor—by using camouﬂage, say, or mimicking the appearance of a
poisonous or aggressive animal.
Human society has also evolved in ways that reﬂect these powerful
statistical ideas. In particular, we have developed to take advantage of
the beneﬁts of large numbers, through a vastly increased complexity
in our social organization. This does not mean that we have usually
been conscious of these beneﬁts, still less that our social organization
has been planned with such beneﬁts in mind. Quite the contrary: our
conscious understanding of statistical ideas has developed slowly, usu-
ally in response to prior social developments. The formal discipline of
statistics, for instance, was an outgrowth of the need of eighteenth-
century nation-states to count and supervise their citizens, and to under-
pin their public ﬁnances by the sale of annuities whose proﬁtability
depended on understanding the patterns of mortality in their already
large populations.3 And our emotional responses to events in our lives
is often more appropriate to the small hunter-gatherer bands in which
we evolved than to the numberless millions to whom our fates are linked
today: a television report about the abduction and murder of a child, for
instance, has all the shocking power of a truly rare atrocity, yet our news
media trawl in such a vast ocean that they can supply us with a diet of
such stories every day, if we have the appetite for them. Our perceptions
of risk are often shaped by the conspicuousness of events rather than
their real frequency: far fewer Americans died in hijacked aircraft on
September 11, 2001, than were to die in cars during the following week,
but the events of that terrifying day have now branded themselves into
our perceptions, knotting the stomachs of airline passengers and leading

Man and the Risks of Nature • 41
travelers in their millions to abandon air travel for the illusory safety of
the car.
The complexity of modern society has had a radical impact on the
kinds of risk we face in our lives: many of these risks are much, much
smaller than anything faced by our ancestors, and some are signiﬁcantly
larger. Yet our ability and willingness to participate in the great experi-
ment that has created modern society rests on a willingness to trust the
strangers we meet, a willingness more emotional than reﬂective. What
makes us willing to entrust our lives to the pilot of an aircraft, accept
food from a stranger in a restaurant, enter a subway train packed full
of our genetic rivals? Most of the time we do not reﬂect more than
glancingly on these choices; when we bring them out into the open,
especially in political debate, our hopes and fears can be animated by
shadows: foreigners, powerful conspirators, demented scientists, child
abductors, terrorists. Homo sapiens sapiens, equipped with emotions
that have evolved to judge the dangers of hunting, the probability of
ﬁnding roots and berries to eat, the risks involved in challenging domi-
nant members of his band, whether he can commit adultery undetected,
must now apply these cognitive tools to assessing genetically modiﬁed
food, the returns to his private pension fund, whether to pay for an
airbag in his car, whether to let his daughter cycle to the grocery store,
and the increased risk of a terrorist attack if he chooses to live downtown
rather than in the suburbs. Some constants remain—the risks involved
in challenging dominant members of his band, whether he can commit
adultery undetected—but the scale of the new challenges is vast.
In this chapter we examine the beneﬁts that large numbers have
brought us, and in chapter 3 we ask how this happened, how our hunter-
gatherer psychology brought these beneﬁts within our grasp. Though
our capacity for trust is the product of our evolution, and therefore sub-
ject to powerful genetic inﬂuences, nothing implies that these genetic
inﬂuences have narrowly determined how we behave—if they had done
so, if we could not adapt ourselves to new challenges, the great exper-
iment could never even have begun. The evolution of human behavior
has been haphazard, and the various impulses that have been favored by
natural selection at diﬀerent times among our ancestors have been only
imperfectly integrated into the thought and action of their descendants.
Nevertheless, it is important for us to understand some of the strong
personalities on the squabbling committee that is the modern human
mind. We face conﬂicts—for instance, between our rational assessment
that the probability of death in an airplane is lower than in a car and

42 • Chapter 2
our greater emotional security when it is our own hand on the steering
wheel rather than an invisible stranger’s hand on the aircraft controls.
Our reasoning capacities have had to survive through millions of years
facing certain kinds of survival problems, and in competition with the
reasoning capacities of our predators and rivals. This history has left its
ﬁngerprint indelibly on the way we reason and the way we behave.
Task-Sharing as a Way to Reduce Risk
Human beings diﬀer from all other species in many ways, and one of
particular importance for our understanding of risk is the high degree
to which unrelated individuals share tasks. Task-sharing takes place
to a limited degree in all species that reproduce sexually. Father and
mother make diﬀerent contributions to the creation and rearing of chil-
dren, often highly unequal contributions in terms of the investment of
time and energy they require, but both essential to the outcome. But
human beings’ capacity—unique in nature, as we have seen—to share
tasks regularly and elaborately with others to whom they are unrelated
has enabled them to exploit the presence of large numbers in a way
unavailable to the other higher mammals. Creatures with large brains
require high parental investment in both hardware (protein) and soft-
ware (knowledge and skill). This requires long gestation and infancy peri-
ods, and a strict limit to the number of children born at each pregnancy.
In addition, the upright posture of human beings, by constricting the
size of the female pelvis, limits the time the human fetus can spend in
the womb: by ape standards, human children are systematically born
premature, and all need intensive care. These facts limit the numbers of
closely related individuals that can expect to be alive at any one time.
Human social organization has therefore required either relatively small-
sized units (like hunter-gatherer bands) or the evolution of a capacity to
exchange goods and favors between unrelated individuals. The social
insects have avoided running up against these constraints only because
of their microscopic brain size—at a cost, therefore, of conﬁnement to a
narrow range of inﬂexible learned behavior patterns on the part of each
individual.
What beneﬁts have large numbers brought? Three main beneﬁts stand
out: risk-sharing, specialization, and the accumulation of knowledge. In a
complex modern society the beneﬁt of risk-sharing seems clear: the risks
of the natural and social worlds do not fall simultaneously on everyone,
and large numbers enable them to be shared. Not everyone’s harvest fails

Man and the Risks of Nature • 43
at the same time; not everyone’s house burns down on the same night;
not everyone’s invention fails to fulﬁll its promise. Sometimes the risk-
sharing is accomplished explicitly, as when an insurance company uses
premium income from the lucky to pay for the damage suﬀered by the
unlucky. More often the risk-sharing is implicit, as when a bank is able
to oﬀer me a more predictable return on my investment than if I lent
directly to any of its borrowing customers. Sometimes ﬂuctuations in
market conditions are themselves ways of sharing risk: when there has
been widespread harvest failure in a region, prices will tend to rise, which
means that buyers share in the losses that would otherwise be borne
only by sellers. These high prices also act as a magnet to suppliers from
elsewhere, creating a natural mechanism whereby producers of the crop
who have not suﬀered a failure send supplies in the direction of those
who have. Most generally of all, large numbers are the comfort not only
of ice-cream sellers and deck-chair attendants but of all traders who face
an unpredictable demand for what they sell. They are the comfort of all
people who would like to go out and buy something, anything from a
pizza to a pair of pants, without having to place a special order for it,
and all its components and ingredients, a long time beforehand. These
ways of beneﬁting from large numbers do not always work: banks can
go bankrupt, pizzas can stay limply on the shelf, speculative frenzies
can mean that rising prices attract even more buyers than sellers (as
did Dutch tulips in the seventeenth century or dotcom stocks in the late
twentieth). But it takes large numbers for them to work at all, and any
people beneﬁting from them are using the laws of statistics, whether
they are aware of it or not.
Our hunter-gatherer ancestors faced most of the risks of nature alone
or in small bands composed primarily of close relatives. Nevertheless,
there is evidence that they began to live in progressively larger groups
as they evolved. The anthropologist Robin Dunbar has shown that there
is a positive correlation across primate species between brain size and
the average size of groups and has argued that individuals need the
extra brain power to keep track of the increased complexity of social
relationships in larger communities.4 Although there is some contro-
versy about how accurately this applies to our early human ancestors, it
seems plausible that while chimpanzees live in groups of approximately
60 individuals, the australopithecine species, who appeared about 4.5
million years ago, lived in groups averaging around 70 members, the
ﬁrst toolmakers (around 2 million years ago) in groups of around 80,
Homo erectus in groups of around 110, and Neanderthal man in groups

44 • Chapter 2
of around 140. It is also likely that group structures became more ﬂuid,
with subgroups coming together from time to time to cooperate on more
ambitious projects.
Even though banks, insurance companies, and markets as we know
them did not exist, these larger groups made possible a better sharing
of risks. Those who found game could share it with the rest of the group
knowing that they would likewise beneﬁt on their own lean days from
the good luck of others. Large groups also made possible larger-scale
activities: hunting large game, which yielded essential protein for the
nourishing of large-brained infants. Part of the reason is the rewards to
sheer scale in contests of force: a group twice the size of another has
much more than twice the chance of killing the animal, so two groups
that can work together have each a much better prospect of ﬁnding pro-
tein than they do when working alone. Part of the reason is insurance: a
large group can aﬀord to dedicate some of its members to an inherently
risky project such as hunting a large and dangerous animal, knowing
that failure in the hunt, or even the death of the hunters, will not mean
starvation for the group as a whole.
Task-Sharing and Specialization
The second main consequence of human beings’ capacity to share tasks
with those to whom they are unrelated is that large numbers enable
specialization. When a large group of individuals cooperate to make their
living in a hostile environment, the real beneﬁts come precisely when
they do not all behave alike, and this fact requires them to exploit the
laws of conditional probability in a much more sophisticated way.
Once again, in a complex modern society this can be taken for granted.
No single farmer could possibly produce all the variety of foods avail-
able in a modern supermarket, both because there are beneﬁts to any
farmer from concentrating on a few crops and because no single climate
and no single soil are suitable for producing everything human beings
enjoy eating. Germans are particularly fond of bananas, for example;
they have one of the highest per capita rates of consumption in the
world. But bananas grow badly (and expensively) in Germany, so Ger-
mans have quite reasonably concentrated on producing other things,
things they can export in order to import bananas in return. In fact, the
doctrine of comparative advantage, propounded in the nineteenth cen-
tury by the economist David Ricardo, drew attention to the striking fact
that it makes sense for individuals and countries to specialize even if

Man and the Risks of Nature • 45
they do everything well.5 They should concentrate on doing what they
do best of all, leaving others to do the rest. A brain surgeon should never
mow her own lawn, even if she does it much better than her gardener,
since the time she spends behind the mower would be much more pro-
ductively spent on neurosurgery. That is good news for brain surgeons,
and it is good news for gardeners, even (or especially) for not-very-good
gardeners. Everyone has a comparative advantage in something even if
there is nothing they do particularly well.
Something similar is true of the various contributions to the process
of making a shirt. It is quite possible for an entire shirt to be made, from
start to ﬁnish, by a single person, but that person must accomplish a
great range of tasks, from growing cotton to spinning and weaving, to
fashioning buttons out of suitable materials, to making all the tools that
are used in these various operations. But in the modern world shirts are
not made this way, other than by extremely poor Hopis or extremely rich
hippies. Instead, the diﬀerent participants specialize, either because of
natural advantages they possess for performing one task rather than
another (the inhabitants of India have a geographical advantage over
Inuits when it comes to growing cotton) or because of an acquired skill.
For some tasks it may not matter what speciality you choose so long as
you specialize in something.
But specializing can itself be a risky process, especially if it requires
training or other kinds of investment; it may therefore depend on the
presence of large numbers of potential customers to be worth undertak-
ing. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Adam Smith described
the way in which artisans, who had specialized in something more
dependent on others than simply growing crops, could usually be found
concentrated in towns. In towns there was less chance that the mar-
ket for their products might just disappear (and they could also learn
from others of their kind). There was a limit to this concentration—
blacksmiths, for instance, usually remained in the villages, because they
needed horses, and horses needed the land. Becoming a blacksmith was
less risky in Adam Smith’s time than it is today, since most villages had
enough horses to support at least one smith. By contrast, it is less risky
to become a biologist than a blacksmith today: in the eighteenth cen-
tury most biologists had to be gentlemen of leisure, whose choice of
occupation had no impact on their subsistence. But both biologists and
blacksmiths need to invest their time and often their money in acquir-
ing the skills necessary for their trades. They have to take this decision
before they know who exactly is going to want their skills enough to oﬀer

46 • Chapter 2
them something valuable in return. The larger and richer the populations
among whom they live, or among whom they can engage in exchange,
the more likely it is that any degree of specialization can be undertaken
at an acceptable level of risk.∗
Much of the growing complexity of human societies in the last few
thousand years has consisted of a self-reinforcing tendency to special-
ize: specialization increases prosperity so that more people are free to
develop new aspirations or satisfy old ones, and thereby in turn gain the
conﬁdence necessary to specialize. And by the same logic, whole soci-
eties have sometimes been stuck in a trap in which failure to specialize
has denied them the prosperity that might have made such specializa-
tion easily aﬀordable. Examples include Japan, which closed itself to the
outside world from the beginning of the seventeenth to the middle of the
nineteenth centuries,6 and many of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa
that won independence from colonizing powers after World War II.
In fact, hunter-gatherer societies began to specialize once they had
found ways to manage cooperation between people who were not related.
Even hunting tasks can be divided up. Some people specialize in track-
ing animals, because they are naturally good at it, because they have
devoted much time and eﬀort to mastering the skills, or both. Others
are the strategists, planning and directing the operation. Others may
act as decoys, learning birdcalls and other tricks to lead the prey into a
trap. Yet others do the club work at the kill. Even small bands of rela-
tives must have divided up tasks to some degree, but as the bands grew
larger, specialization, and the uses to which it could be put, became more
ambitious.
Once bands were willing to make tentative peaceful contact with other
bands, they could exchange with them, thereby enormously expand-
ing the kinds of foods, tools, and resources to which they had access.
We have evidence of exchange between hunter-gatherers from many
thousands of years before the foundation of agriculture, although their
lifestyle must have made such contacts sporadic and limited by com-
parison with the opportunities available to sedentary farmers in later
millennia. Some of the oldest known symbolic artifacts, carved beads
dating back over forty thousand years, may have played a role in facili-
tating such exchanges.7 In more recent times, the Yir Yoront aboriginals
∗The death in April 2003 of Charlie Douglass, the inventor of canned laughter for
television, was a poignant reminder that the modern world has produced a luxuriance of
specialist professions that would have been utterly baﬄing to even our recent ancestors
(see the Independent, April 25, 2003).

Man and the Risks of Nature • 47
of Northern Australia had stone axes even though they lived many hun-
dreds of kilometers from the nearest stone quarries (they exchanged
stingray-tipped spears for them with neighboring tribes) and even steel
ones, well before their ﬁrst contact with European traders at the end of
the nineteenth century.8 Trade allowed access not only to their neigh-
bors’ skills but to those of their neighbors’ neighbors, and so on.
Perhaps the greatest innovation came when the bands grew large
enough for some of their members to specialize entirely in activities
that made no immediate contribution to the band’s food supply: war-
fare against other human beings and the organization and transmission
of knowledge. The army and the priesthood were born.
For this to happen took a great many facilitating circumstances,
notably the adoption of agriculture and a settled lifestyle, without which
food storage is impossible on a signiﬁcant scale. But once this occurred,
beginning around ten thousand years ago, the army and the priesthood
grew rapidly in both size and importance, because bands were in com-
petition with each other. Once you have invested in an army, it pays
to have a big one, since you can enslave other bands whose armies are
smaller or weaker than your own and steal their food without having
to grow or gather it yourself: slaves quickly became the third special-
ist caste. Indeed, stealing food from hunter-gatherers is usually more
trouble than it is worth, since they have so little to steal. Only farmers
who have stored a whole harvest are a worthwhile target for systematic
plunder. The consequences of this competitive spiral are the subject of
chapter 16.
Similarly, once you have a priesthood, it pays to have a literate and
organized priesthood, so that this generation’s specialists can draw on
some of the skills of the previous generation without having to learn
everything anew. Symbolic artifacts—durable records of the ideas and
utterances of previous generations—become a means for sharing of
tasks between generations, thereby leading to the accumulation of col-
lective knowledge that is the third great beneﬁt of cooperation among
large numbers, a phenomenon that is examined in detail in chapter 11.
Prior to the foundation of agriculture, specialization had even fed back
into human evolution by changing the stakes in the evolution of intelli-
gence. When your band is small and everyone in it behaves more or less
alike, there is little to be gained from developing a sophisticated capac-
ity for psychological insight or a subtle sense of social hierarchy. When
societies become larger and more specialized, those who can anticipate
and adapt to this complexity are much more likely to prosper than those

48 • Chapter 2
who cannot. The selective pressures in favor of social intelligence must
have become signiﬁcantly stronger over time (and have probably contin-
ued since the invention of agriculture, though this time is too short for
there to have been a clearly perceptible eﬀect). It has been persuasively
argued by Steven Mithen in his book The Prehistory of the Mind that the
changed selective pressures associated with large bands and more com-
plex task-sharing played a crucial part in the evolution of the modern
human brain. They were particularly important in shaping the develop-
ment of its capacities for art, culture, and a scientiﬁc approach to the
natural world, of which early human beings have left us no traces older
than sixty thousand years, at most.
Specialization and New Kinds of Risk
The specialization of modern societies has increased to a degree un-
imaginable by our hunter-gatherer ancestors, and that would have been
astonishing even to our eighteenth-century relatives. Much of this spe-
cialization has been the fruit of the greater security that larger and richer
societies make possible, but its eﬀect has not always been to reinforce
that security. Quite the contrary: people specialize more than ever in
activities that put them at the mercy of the disappearance of markets
for their products and skills. This is no stranger than the observation
that it is usually people who own the safest cars who drive most dan-
gerously. Such behavior is known as risk compensation; it has been doc-
umented, for example, in relation to the eﬀect of legislation requiring
the wearing of seat belts in cars.9 (John Adams has even argued that if
we really care about reducing car accidents, we should oblige all cars
to be ﬁtted with a sharp spike on the steering wheel pointed at the
driver’s chest.10) Risk compensation is not pathological: it is the very
behavior that—fortunately—makes us behave more cautiously on moun-
tainsides than in meadows. But it has implications for the kinds of risk
that modern societies face.
Until around six hundred years ago in Europe, and until a little more
recently in North America, most families ate food they had grown
themselves.11 They were certainly not self-suﬃcient in the strict sense
since they usually relied on others for some things—metal for agricul-
tural tools, for example. But changes in their links with the outside
world would rarely threaten their food supply. Today, in the same coun-
tries, most families who were prevented from exchanging with others
would starve within a few weeks. Threats to their ability to exchange are

Man and the Risks of Nature • 49
unlikely to come from physical obstacles, except in wartime (as the pop-
ulation of Leningrad—now St. Petersburg again—discovered under siege
from Hitler’s army in the winter of 1941). Much more likely is a threat
to their ability to oﬀer anything in exchange, that is, a situation in which
nobody wants to buy what they have to sell. This is the main risk that
members of highly specialized societies face today.
It is usually a mistake to think that the risks that come from depending
on exchange with others are greater than the risks that come from fac-
ing the environment alone. Most families even three hundred years ago
were far more likely to die from the failure of their own crops or from dis-
ease than are their descendants today to die from all causes combined.
Around one child in ﬁve died in the ﬁrst year of life (and even more in
the crowded and ﬁlthy cities), compared to less than one child in two
hundred in Europe and North America today. Self-suﬃciency is some-
times a positive curse: without regular exchange with others you cannot
get medical treatment when you need it, you cannot borrow to cover
temporary disasters, you cannot quickly replace a broken tool. The mis-
guided pursuit of self-suﬃciency in recent decades has cost many poor
countries dearly, making them unable, for instance, to import adequate
supplies when their own domestic harvest fails. So depending on oth-
ers does not necessarily create greater risks for the citizens of today’s
specialized societies. But it does create very diﬀerent risks.
Many people in today’s world have seen their livelihoods threatened
and their savings disappear, not (or not only) through any fault of their
own, not (or not only) through the hazards of a natural and therefore
impersonal environment, but through the faraway actions of many other
people who in most cases have neither intended nor even been aware of
that result. Coal miners for the last few decades have been squeezed
between the rising costs of digging coal from the ground and the deci-
sions of many consumers, politicians, and civil servants that coal is an
expensive and dirty fuel. Those who make such a judgment did not want
to put coal miners out of work, but that is what happened as a result of
their decisions. Many families lost the savings they had invested in the
real estate booms in United States in the 1980s, Thailand in the 1990s—
and again in the United States in the ﬁrst decade of the new millennium,
as I discuss in detail in chapter 8. The other real estate investors whose
loss of conﬁdence caused the booms to collapse did not intend others
to lose their savings as a result. They neither knew nor cared, any more
than they had known or cared that others were beneﬁting from their
optimism during the boom years. The reason for that collapse was a

50 • Chapter 2
subtle misunderstanding of the laws of statistics. Each investor thought
the others were making independent judgments and did not realize how
correlated their behavior was. No one understood that the whole boom
was nothing but a Fourth of July parade.
It would be a mistake to think that specialization and its associated
risks are the consequence of the market economy alone. The market
economy is one of the historical faces of specialization, but it is not the
only one. Quite the contrary: some of the saddest examples of individu-
als and even whole communities marooned by the tides of demand for
their products and skills are to be found in the countries of the former
Soviet Union. Under central planning, specialization was pursued to a
very high degree, with little attention to the real economic costs of the
pattern adopted, which were crippling but did not become clearly visible
until a system of markets was put into operation in the 1990s. Central
planners combined a desire that each country in the Soviet bloc should
specialize intensively, with a desire that the bloc as a whole should be
self-suﬃcient in relation to the rest of the world economy. Many peo-
ple were sent to Siberia or to Central Asia in the 1950s and 1960s to
work the immense natural resources of those regions, but often wasting
resources in ways that were only possible because the distorted price
system treated them as free or almost free. Cotton growers in Uzbek-
istan beneﬁted from “free” water, which they used in such abundance
that the Aral Sea, fed from the rivers that were now dammed for irriga-
tion, shrank to half its surface area and a third of its volume in less than
thirty years. It left behind a great bowl of salt-encrusted, chemically pol-
luted, infertile land, and from this bowl the steppe winds blow poison
dust into the lungs of over two million inhabitants, who now suﬀer from
one of the highest incidences of respiratory disease in the world. Here is
a striking exception to the claim made in chapter 1 that shirts are com-
paratively free of interpersonal externalities, of the kind associated with
pollution. For when the authorities treat the environment as expendable,
even cotton shirts can be bad for us: decisions to grow cotton do direct
damage to people’s health. Uzbekistan’s cotton growers also enjoyed
“free” energy: as late as 1995 families were reported to be keeping their
gas cookers running twenty-four hours a days because of a shortage of
matches. Free or almost free energy led people to ignore energy con-
servation completely: even today many apartments in northern Russian
cities are heated by boilers that send water across distances up to sev-
eral kilometers in poorly insulated pipes laid in the frosty ground, and

of the Aral Sea over the last several decades. The level of the sea has fallen
from 53 meters to 33 meters, its volume from 53 to 20 cubic kilometers, and

even today the only way to lower the temperature in many apartments
is to open the window.
What was the result of such prodigality? Many towns across Russia
have spent the years since the collapse of communism a state of paraly-
sis: the manufacture of polluting fertilizers, drab haberdashery, unreli-
able tractors, bug-ridden electronic goods—many of them unsaleable at

52 • Chapter 2
any realistic price—ground to a halt once there were no central planners
to order these activities. Those who lived by them were, in the main,
doing their reasonable best by the standards of their time. To them it
seems not that their methods of manufacture were shortsighted but that
the world that has changed its mind about what it wants.
It’s hard to blame the new economic realism, any more than you can
blame the funeral for the decease. After all, attempts to cover up the true
costs by creative accounting still require someone to foot the bill. Fisher-
men in the Evenki Autonomous District of Russia’s sub-Arctic, for exam-
ple, continued to deal with the local Tura Aviation Enterprise. Anthro-
pologist David Anderson explains:
Every spring and autumn the Tura Aviation Enterprise carries a number
of Russians out to isolated lakes and rivers throughout the district so
that they may set nets and collect barrels of…whiteﬁsh and grayling.
This very expensive service (costing in the order of several tens of thou-
sands of roubles per trip) is supplied in exchange for barrels of ﬁsh
which are either given to the pilots or to the enterprise (or to both) for
eventual resale. Some fresh ﬁsh is realised through the [town] store….
Other ﬁsh is no doubt shared between the aviation community. Some
ﬁsh undoubtedly ﬁnds its way to the tables of high-placed government
people in Krasnoiarsk. The high tariﬀs charged by the aviation com-
pany for these ﬁshing expeditions scarcely cover the paper costs of the
wages, fuel, and capital costs of the aircraft. On paper, as the pilots joke,
the mutual debit arrangement for transport is eﬀected in exchange for
ﬁsh which by its weight is more expensive than gold.12
The arrangement continued long after it ceased to be economic because
many of the debts were never paid, locking both sides into a futile pro-
cess of throwing good money after bad.
When livelihoods disappear, monetary compensation sometimes helps.
But only sometimes. For younger workers a redundancy payment can
provide the necessary impetus to move, to retrain, to start a second
life. For workers in their forties and above, it is often too late: money
may avoid starvation, but it can never restore the sense of having lived a
worthwhile life. In prosperous countries those who suﬀer in this way are
often divided, dispersed among the population, unaware of a common
identity. Sometimes they become a soil for angry and vengeful political
movements—usually, though not always, those of the political right. In
Russia after the fall of communism they found a somber identity in the
mortality statistics: men’s life expectancy fell from 65 years in the 1980s
to 57 by the mid 1990s—a level equal to that of Zambia before the advent

of AIDS, and, in contrast to Zambia’s, not due principally to infant mor-
tality but to a near doubling of the death rate among men above the age
of 45. Vodka and violence were usually implicated, often in combina-
tion, and rates of suicide soared. With renewed economic growth at the
turn of the millennium, suicide rates began to fall again and male life
expectancy climbed back to around 61 years. But progress is fragile and
may be reversed by the current economic crisis that has hit Russia hard.
The predicament of unemployed steelworkers, coal miners, ﬁshermen
(not to mention the rich world’s textile workers, secretaries, automobile
assemblers—all those whose skills are less in demand than they used
to be) is not at all new in history. But it has added to the risks with
which our hunter-gatherer ancestors were more familiar, the risk of the
natural world and its predators and the risk posed by human enemies,
neither of which has disappeared. Our emotional reactions to risk are
still shaped by that hunter-gatherer heritage. We treat those who suﬀer
the hazards of life either as casualties of a blind chance that we may fear
but cannot logically resent, or as victims—chosen suﬀerers of deliberate
aggression to which the only emotional response is resentment and the
only justiﬁable response, revenge. Even today the debate about the costs
of economic change in an integrated world is polarized between those
who see no casualties, only victims (like the doomed heroes who fought
on picket lines to prevent the closing of British coal mines in the long and
futile strike of 1984–85), and those who see no victims, only casualties
(like those brisk prophets of globalization who are only concerned about
reducing trade barriers and not about those who will be hurt as a result).
The truth is that those who are hurt by economic change in today’s world
are predominantly neither casualties nor victims. They fall into a diﬀer-
ent category, one needing both an emotional and a practical response
for which our history has poorly prepared us.
This brings us back to the theme with which we began. The practi-
cal intelligence that has evolved among human beings is very skilled at
manipulating the natural environment and managing the interactions of
small groups of individuals who see each other frequently and know each
other well. It is only in the last ten thousand years—far too recently for
genetic evolution to have contributed to fashioning adequate emotional
and rational responses—that human beings have had to come to terms
on a signiﬁcant scale with the impact of strangers, and it is only in the
last two hundred or so that this impact has become a dominant fact of
everyday life. To manage the hazards imposed on us by the actions of
distant strangers has required us to deploy a diﬀerent skill bequeathed

54 • Chapter 2
to us by evolution for quite diﬀerent purposes: the capacity for abstract
symbolic thought. In their response to risk no less than in their han-
dling of conﬂict, modern political institutions seek to restrain by the
slender threads of abstract reasoning the passions and resentments of
the hunter-gatherer band.

Our Violent Past
The Murderousness of Man
Banpo is a village in central China that was inhabited around six thou-
sand years ago by a small agricultural community. As archeologists have
reconstructed it, some twenty huts were clustered around a slightly
larger building, with smaller shelters for animals and for the storage
of food. It looks very like the hamlets in southern India where I spent a
year doing ﬁeldwork as a graduate student, and one might be forgiven
for thinking that life in farming communities had hardly changed in sixty
centuries. Except in one respect. The village at Banpo is surrounded by
a vast ditch. It measures three hundred meters in circumference and is
at least ﬁve meters deep and six to eight meters wide at the top. Digging
the ditch required moving ten thousand cubic meters of earth. It must
have been an exhausting task for a few score hungry people—and the
villagers at Banpo were surely no better fed than the desperately poor
inhabitants of those Indian hamlets. Life in the Indian villages is very
hard, but in one way at least it is a big improvement over life in Banpo.
If the Banpo villagers were prepared to invest in a ditch that size, it was
because they lived their lives in perpetual fear.
Looking at that ditch in Banpo brings home just what an achievement
it has been for humanity to learn to trust strangers. We know that it
has brought large beneﬁts, but we still need to understand how it ever
became possible. It is virtually unknown in the rest of the animal king-
dom, and it involves important risks. Only rarely do two individuals make
a simultaneous exchange of goods or favors of a known value. Much more
commonly there is a favor extended by one in return for a compensating
favor at a later date. You give me meat from your mammoth in exchange
for a promise of meat in the future; you make me a loan in exchange for
a promised sequence of interest payments. How can you be sure I will
keep my promise? Even when exchange is simultaneous it often involves
a risk: in exchange for your potatoes I have given you vodka, but the

56 • Chapter 3
vodka may be spiked with methylated spirit; the motorbike I have given
you may break down as soon as you drive it, even as I am struggling to
repair the washing machine you gave me in return.∗
When individuals are close relatives this element of risk does not nec-
essarily prevent fruitful exchange. Natural selection has favored genetic
mutations that encourage helping of relatives, which has two distinct
advantages. First, relatives are more likely than nonrelatives to keep their
promises, and secondly, it matters less if they do not. A mutation that, on
balance, makes its bearer more likely to help relatives will favor the prop-
agation of copies of itself in future generations provided enough beneﬁt
can be given to relatives for any particular cost to the giver. Indeed,
although a sibling shares on average only half of an individual’s genes,
this still makes for as close a genetic relationship as the individual has
with its own child. This does not eliminate rivalry among relatives—far
from it—but it has favored, throughout the animal kingdom, valuable
and sometimes complex systems of interrelative exchange.
In contrast, helping nonrelatives is valuable in evolutionary terms only
when the favor is returned. But the incentives to cheat are many; and,
regrettably, human beings cheat in more costly and dangerous ways than
any other species. Among the melancholy achievements of Homo sapiens
is not only to be more intelligent than any other species but also to have
slaughtered members of its own species more vigorously, systematically,
and cruelly than any other in nature. In his novel Crime and Punishment,
Dostoyevsky depicted his character Raskolnikov as haunted by the enor-
mity of the murder he had committed,1 and many readers have seen the
novel as support for the view that human beings have a complete and
instinctive repugnance for murder, a repugnance that is mysteriously
absent only in a tiny minority of psychopaths. It is a moving vision, but
one that is sadly incompatible with what we know of the pressures that
have shaped our evolution (as well as with much of modern history).
For there are good reasons to think not only that natural selection has
favored a tendency to kill other members of the same species but also
that the coincidence of murderousness and intelligence is not accidental.
On the contrary, the selection for murderousness and the selection for
intelligence are mutually reinforcing. The more murderous the species,
the greater the selective beneﬁt of intelligence to individual members,
and the more intelligent the species, the greater the selective beneﬁt of
murderousness to individual members.
∗As the old communist joke had it, “We pretend to work, and they pretend to pay
us.”

Our Violent Past • 57
The ﬁrst point is reasonably easy to understand. Intelligence already
confers a selective advantage when the main hazards you face are the
hazards of nature. But the selective advantage is even stronger when
the hazards include aggression from other individuals who are on aver-
age just as intelligent as you. So any evolution toward murderousness
among our ancestors would have increased the speed at which intelli-
gence evolved.
The second point is a little more subtle. What are the selective pres-
sures in favor of murderousness, and why should they be stronger in an
intelligent species? The pressures in favor of murderousness arise from
a simple fact: two unrelated individuals are rivals, both for resources
and—if they are males—for the sexual favors of females. (Females are
not sexual rivals in the same sense, since a male’s impregnation of one
female does not prevent him from impregnating another very shortly
afterwards, though they may well be rivals for the resources that the
male controls.) The fact that murder is much more commonly carried
out by men than women, even allowing for such factors as diﬀerences
in physical strength and access to weapons, suggests that sexual rivalry
has been much the stronger factor of the two in the evolution of human
violence.2 Killing an unrelated member of the same sex and species elim-
inates a sexual rival.3 This incidentally seems a likely explanation for the
disturbing tendency of violence to be associated with a sexual thrill; it is
not, regrettably, a pathological response of a sick minority but an evolved
anticipation of the increased sexual access that comes from successful
elimination of rivals. It is one that has been reinforced down the ages
by a tendency on the part of females—far from universal, but suﬃcient
to make a diﬀerence—to be drawn sexually to those who have displayed
prowess in contests of force, as Shakespeare knew well when he made
Henry V rally his troops before Agincourt with the cry that:
…gentlemen in England now abed
Shall think themselves accurs’d they were not here,
And hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks
That fought with us upon St. Crispin’s Day.4
It is well-known that once a certain characteristic becomes a basis for
sexual preference, such preferences can be self-reinforcing. This is a ten-
dency that has been adduced to explain such runaway evolutionary phe-
nomena as the peacock’s tail and the large antlers of some species of
deer. The fact that females in future generations will be attracted by
some characteristic, even a wholly arbitrary one, increases the adaptive

beneﬁt to any female in the current generation of seeking a mate that has
that characteristic. As it happens, there is some evidence from preindus-
trial societies that males who kill other males tend to have larger num-
bers of children than males who do not—though this evidence is sketchy
and controversial.5 But even if a tendency for females to be sexually

Our Violent Past • 59
drawn to ﬁghters had no direct adaptive beneﬁt (say, if the greater ability
of violent males to gain food from others were oﬀset by their increased
likelihood of an early death), once such a tendency had become estab-
lished it could become indirectly adaptive through the greater likelihood
that ﬁghters would ﬁnd mates. Even if nice guys don’t ﬁnish last in the
line for food, they may ﬁnish last in the line for mates. Nice guys may
have other attractions (they may share more with their females, for one
thing), but if they have sons who can’t do well in the contest for females,
that already counts against them as mates.6
Why, then, should the growing intelligence of the forerunners of Homo
sapiens sapiens have increased these selective pressures in favor of mur-
derousness? In a species where contests are decided mainly by brute
force, a male can eliminate a sexual rival simply by forcing him physi-
cally to submit. But the more intelligent the rival, the more likely it is
that, having submitted now, he will ﬁnd a cunning way to return to his
sexual pursuit later on. So eliminating permanently the rival who has
been temporarily defeated is a strategy that confers much more selec-
tive beneﬁt in an intelligent species.
Three sources of evidence reinforce this evolutionary argument that
human beings, especially males, are likely to be strongly disposed to
kill other, unrelated individuals in the appropriate circumstances. The
ﬁrst is the behavior of other primates, particularly other apes.7 This evi-
dence needs to be interpreted with caution, since there is great variety
in primate behavior, even between such closely related species as chim-
panzees and bonobos, and this variety indicates that social and ecolog-
ical factors can have a strong impact on the incidence of violence. This
environmental ﬂexibility in itself should come as no surprise: indeed,
it is a central argument of this book that institutional arrangements
have enormously increased the ability of human beings to live with-
out violence among those they would otherwise be disposed to ﬁght.
But careful observation in the wild has nevertheless yielded sobering
discoveries. When unconstrained by fear of reprisals, many other pri-
mates systematically exploit opportunities to kill individuals who are
not related to themselves. Infanticide by unrelated males, for instance,
has been regularly observed among chimpanzees, gorillas, and langurs
(as well as in some other mammals, such as lions). Among bonobos it
is certainly less common, and no documented cases are known; but this
appears to be because females work cooperatively to ensure their infants
are protected against marauding males, not because the males them-
selves are intrinsically trustworthy. Among chimpanzees, related males

60 • Chapter 3
regularly cooperate to launch violent, unprovoked attacks against iso-
lated and defenseless members of other troops, even when such attacks
yield no food or other resources. Such incidents were not known before
the work of Jane Goodall and her collaborators (in fact, the writings of
Konrad Lorenz8 had popularized the idea that intraspecies violence was
largely ritualized, a view that is now known from ﬁeld studies to be mis-
taken). The violence among chimpanzees is particularly revealing since
it occurs to a large extent between groups of males of unequal size,
and without particular provocation. This kind of behavior reﬂects the
random encounters of foraging parties and looks disturbingly similar
to patterns of aggression between groups of human males. Violence,
in short, is endemic among the species most closely related to man. In
species where it happens less often, this is because of behavior patterns
that have evolved to deter it, and not because of instincts that would
be purely peaceable without fear of reprisals. Whatever its fundamental
causes, violence in primates, and especially in the great apes, cannot be
described as pathological.
A second source of evidence for the innate murderousness of Homo
sapiens consists in ethnographic accounts of contemporary nonindus-
trial societies, many of which (contrary to popular myth) are extremely
violent.9 Considerable controversy still surrounds these reports, and it
is undeniable that levels of observed violence vary across nonindustrial
societies for reasons that are still very imperfectly understood. It may be
true, for instance, that simple agricultural societies are somewhat more
warlike than hunter-gatherers (a reasonable conjecture, if only because
they have more resources to ﬁght over). Alternatively, this apparent ten-
dency may reﬂect the fact that agricultural societies simply leave more
traces of the ﬁghting they do (in the form of torched huts and pillaged
storehouses), or that they are easier for anthropologists to visit in unset-
tled times than are hunter-gatherer communities. Overall, the evidence
does suggest that sedentary societies have had more extensive patterns
of ﬁghting10 and a greater tendency for stratiﬁcation and hierarchy11
than their immediate nonsedentary predecessors, but that most hunter-
gatherers have still had much higher levels of violence than characterize
almost all modern societies.
Whatever the explanation for these observed variations, the idea that
preindustrial societies were largely peaceful, which has had a seduc-
tive hold over human thinking since Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote about
noble savages in the eighteenth century, has now been convincingly
discredited.12 Anthropologist Carol Ember wrote a pioneering article in

Our Violent Past • 61
1978, “Myths about hunter-gatherers,” which showed that nearly two-
thirds of hunter-gatherer groups for which records existed waged war
at least every two years.13 Ethnographic accounts of high levels of vio-
lence, between individuals and between groups, exist for nonindustrial
societies as diﬀerent as the Akoa, the Bushmen, the Tasmanians, and the
Yanomamo. Among preindustrial agriculturists, regular and deadly war-
fare has now been documented for societies once thought to be peace-
loving, such as the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest.14 Many
such ethnographies could be cited: a striking example is the book Blood
Is Their Argument, in which anthropologist Mervyn Meggitt records the
very bloody cycles of violence among the Mae Enga people of the central
highlands of Papua New Guinea.15 Azar Gat’s history of War in Human
Civilization opens with chilling accounts of violence among precontact
aboriginals in Australia, and the rest of the book provides a masterly
overview of evidence from a vast range of prehistoric as well as histor-
ical societies. Once again the message is sobering: where there are no
institutional restraints on it, systematic killing of unrelated individuals
is so common among human beings that, awful though it is, it cannot be
described as exceptional, pathological, or disturbed.
A third source of evidence for high levels of violence among our ances-
tors and cousins comes from archeology. Some of it is direct, based on
skeletons. A reconstruction of a Neanderthal skeleton from St. Cesaire,
France, shows marks of having been broken by a blow from a sharp
knife or sword.16 More graphic evidence still comes from arrowheads
embedded in the skeletal remains of modern humans, for instance from
the Schild site in Illinois. Lawrence Keeley provides a summary of the
evidence, with estimates for diﬀerent communities varying from under
5% to over 40% of deaths as having been from violent causes.17 Samuel
Bowles has undertaken a more recent review of the evidence and esti-
mates a mean mortality from violence of 14% among foragers.18 It is
diﬃcult to estimate the proportion of people who have died from vio-
lence because a lot of violence doesn’t leave marks on skeletons. It’s also
possible that people who have died from violence may have been buried
with less care than others, so their skeletons may be found more easily.
In short, there is much controversy surrounding these estimates, which
is also reﬂected in their high variance. But though the variance is very
high, their average is also extremely high.
Some of the archeological evidence is indirect, from artefacts (like
swords and spears) and fortiﬁcations (like the ditch at Banpo). True,
the evidence from artefacts can be interpreted in diﬀerent ways. Some

62 • Chapter 3
weapons may have served more as ornaments or to help men in impress-
ing women than as means of self-defense, just as some men today buy
fast cars mainly in order to cruise slowly and conspicuously round the
neighborhood. But the evidence from fortiﬁcations is harder to argue
away—men don’t build walls and dig ditches to impress women unless
walls and ditches are what their women really want. The ﬁrst village set-
tlement at Jericho, for instance, has been dated to before 9000 b.c.e., and
within a thousand years it had grown to a substantial settlement of sev-
eral hectares of mud-brick houses with thick walls. The ﬁrst evidence of
the famous city walls comes from the early eighth century b.c.e., and the
presence of great water tanks, probably for irrigation, is attested from
the seventh century. And a massive ditch, thirty feet deep and ten feet
wide, was dug into the rock without metal tools. A single family could
never have managed protection on this scale; as at Banpo, this was a
collective project, meeting collective needs.
These three types of evidence—from primate behavior, from ethno-
graphic accounts of violence in nonindustrial societies, and from arche-
ology—only serve to deepen the mystery of how human large-scale
cooperation ever got oﬀthe ground at all. In short, and whatever the
precise evolutionary origins of such behavior, the potential costs of being
cheated were dangerously high for human beings dealing with nonrela-
tives. Not only might your ancestor never have been repaid for the ante-
lope meat he gave my ancestor, but he might have been murdered in
return. Many itinerant traders making tentative ﬁrst contacts with an
unfamiliar tribe have suﬀered just such a fate. In the circumstances it is
astonishing that systematic exchange among nonrelatives should have
evolved at all, let alone that it should have become the foundation of the
fantastically complex social and economic life we know today.
Yet violence has become much less common in modern life than it
was for our ancestors during virtually the entire period of our evolution.
Take Samuel Bowles’s estimate that a typical hunter-gatherer had a 14%
chance of dying a violent death. The mortality level in world today is tiny
by comparison. Today the rates of violent death are around 1.3% of all
deaths—less than a tenth of Bowles’s ﬁgure. That includes war, urban
violence, everything; remarkably, it’s even less than the rate of suicide.
It’s only a little over half of the rate of death from road accidents. As a
random citizen of the world today you are more likely to die at your own
hand than at the hand of somebody else—unless that person happens
to be driving a car.19

Our Violent Past • 63
So something rather remarkable has happened. The high mortality
from violent competition between groups in the hunter-gatherer soci-
eties in which we evolved, and which is also extremely high in chim-
panzees and in other primate societies, has fallen dramatically during
the period since we adopted states and other centralized political orga-
nizations. Evidence from more modern times helps us to see this pro-
cess at work. The criminologist Manuel Eisner has drawn together evi-
dence about the change in homicide rates in England from the thirteenth
century to the twentieth century, based on a large number of village
records.20 There is a very steady downward trend in the homicide rates
over that period of time, with no single deﬁning moment or period mark-
ing the transition. Although the evidence from other countries is less
plentiful, it shows a similar pattern. Italy really was more violent than
England in the Middle Ages (it wasn’t just Shakespeare’s imagination);
in the fourteenth century, for instance, Italian homicide rates were over
twice as high as in England. But Italy, like the Netherlands, Scandinavia,
Germany, and Switzerland, saw a steady decline in rates of homicide
over that period. We’ll consider possible explanations for this in the next
chapter. But the evidence doesn’t suggest any single deﬁning event, any
simple cause.
The downward trend in homicide rates is mirrored in another devel-
opment: the declining frequency in wars between states. Measured in
terms of the numbers of years in each century in which either at least
one great power was at war, or in which there was a war between the
great powers, the historian Jack Levy calculated that after the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, which were roughly equal in the incidence of
war, there was a steep fall in the eighteenth and then in the nineteenth
centuries, with the twentieth having about the same frequency of war as
the nineteenth but in any case much less than in previous centuries.21
Even allowing for a modern shift away from wars between nation-
states and towards civil wars, what this tells us about the twentieth
century may seem strange. Surely the twentieth century was the most
violent century humanity has ever known? Measured in terms of total
violent deaths that verdict is uncontestable, but the reason is that the
total population alive in the twentieth century was far larger than that in
any previous century. A plausible estimate of the proportion of deaths
due to violence in the twentieth century puts it at between 4% and 5% of
all deaths for the twentieth century taken as a whole.22 That’s at least
three times larger than it is now in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, but it’s

64 • Chapter 3
only a third of the rate estimated by Bowles for a typical year in the life
of a hunter-gatherer band.
The outbreaks of brutality that took place on a massive scale in the
twentieth century are a reminder that the achievement of modern soci-
eties in reducing the risk of violence far below prehistoric levels remains
a fragile one. But it is no less an achievement for that. Remarkably, trust
in nonrelatives has become an established fact of modern social life.
When I go into a shop, a person who has never seen me before will hand
over valuable goods to me in exchange for a scribble on a piece of paper.
We who do this so nonchalantly are the descendants of people who knew
better than even to try. When there is a knock on the door, I am prepared
to allow into my home a man I have never met, who is wearing the uni-
form of a local domestic appliance store. Why do I infer that his purpose
is to repair the washing machine instead of to kill me and rape the women
of the house? How has this degree of trust become possible? Buyers do
sometimes pass bad checks; murderous rapists do sometimes pose as
repairmen—but it happens rarely enough not to threaten the general
trustworthiness of these social transactions. What is the explanation?

How Have We Tamed Our Violent Instincts?
Calculation and Reciprocity
Like chimpanzees, human beings are prone to violence when they can
easily get away with it, and are much more peaceful when violence
doesn’t pay. The simple explanation for the large fall in the incidence
of violence in human societies since prehistory is therefore that we have
managed to cooperate in increasingly sophisticated ways that make set-
tling disputes peacefully more attractive than resorting to violence. Of
course, that just pushes the question one step further back. Why have
we succeeded in organizing society round a more generally cooperative
model?
We can be fairly conﬁdent that our ancestors evolved to trust famil-
iar nonrelatives before they came to have trust in strangers. When two
individuals expect to see each other often in the future, they have an
additional incentive to keep agreements: cheating might bring a short-
term beneﬁt, but it would jeopardize the possibility of cooperation in the
future. Provided the beneﬁts of future cooperation are suﬃciently large
and suﬃciently certain, and the future in question is not too distant,
the individuals may resist the temptation to cheat for short-term gain.
Such cooperative tendencies probably evolved in two main ways. First,
they are a by-product of the evolution of intelligence. As human social
intelligence developed, individuals could increasingly calculate that their
long-term interest lay in keeping rather than breaking certain kinds of
agreement, namely, those with individuals they expected to see again
repeatedly in the relatively near future and from whose goodwill they
expected to beneﬁt.
The second way such cooperative tendencies developed is through
selection for what has been called “strong reciprocity,” namely, an
instinctive inclination to do unto others as they have already done unto

66 • Chapter 4
you (it’s called “strong” reciprocity to distinguish it from the kind of
reciprocity that could just be due to calculation). If others have treated
you well, you treat them well in return, but if they have hurt you, you
hurt them back—independently of whether you think it will do you any
good. An eye for an eye, certainly, but also a gift for a gift.
Both of these motives for cooperation have been important in human
evolution, and both continue to play an important part in human motiva-
tion today. At ﬁrst sight the distinction between them may seem rather
unimportant: what diﬀerence does it make whether the motive for coop-
eration is calculation or instinctive reciprocity, when most of the people
with whom you deal are those whom you have dealt with in the past and
whom you hope to continue to deal with in the future? And even if you
knew the diﬀerence in principle, how could you tell in practice? But in
fact the distinction matters, because it provides the key to how humans
have evolved to trust complete strangers, those they have never seen
before.
Studies of human cooperative behavior in many diﬀerent contexts
have clearly established that the hope of future cooperation plays an
important role in reinforcing cooperation in the present. It is known that
people cooperate more when they interact frequently, when they have
the means of telling whether others have cheated, and when the gains
from cooperation, as opposed to going it alone, are large. These factors
have proved important in such diverse contexts as military engagements,
care of the environment, and the eﬀectiveness with which local polit-
ical institutions respond to the needs of the population.1 There used,
however, to be much controversy about whether people also have an
instinct for strong reciprocity (a reaction to how they have been treated
in the past independently of the prospects for future collaboration). It
was thought to be impossible to disentangle one motive from the other
when almost all human interaction involves a seamless transition from
past involvements to future anticipations.
Now a set of ingenious laboratory experiments by Ernst Fehr and col-
leagues at the University of Zurich has shown that individuals receiving
generous treatment from others they will not meet again nevertheless
often respond generously to them in return.2 For instance, in an exper-
iment that mimicked behavior in labor markets, subjects took the part
of workers or ﬁrms and were randomly and anonymously matched with
each other (the participants in the experiment were students playing at
computer terminals). Firms could choose to pay a minimum wage or a
wage above the minimum; workers could choose to make a minimum

How Have We Tamed Our Violent Instincts? • 67
investment (a monetary equivalent of “eﬀort”) or a level above the min-
imum. After each turn participants were rematched, and none knew
whether the partners with whom they were matched were partners with
whom they had been matched before.
It became clear as the experiment proceeded that many workers who
had been generously treated by their employers were likely to make
high levels of investment. This investment brought them no beneﬁt,
since any ﬁrm with which they were matched in the future would
not know how they had previously behaved. So their behavior must
have been due to reciprocity and not to calculation. Nevertheless, ﬁrms
in turn gradually learned to beneﬁt from this, as the cost of paying
high wages to workers was more than outweighed by the value of the
extra investment they undertook as a result. So ﬁrms that paid high
wages were more proﬁtable than those that did not—not the conven-
tional capitalist view.3 There remain unresolved questions about the
wider applicability of results obtained under laboratory conditions,
but the ﬁndings have since been replicated so many times by other
researchers that there is no longer any serious doubt about their robust-
ness (they are not due to cheating or misunderstanding by students,
for example, and real money is at stake). These ﬁndings suggest not
only that cultures of cooperation may persist through strong reciprocity
but also that groups in which cooperative habits have developed may
be more economically successful than those in which more narrowly
self-interested behavior is the norm. Paradoxically, too narrow a nose
for proﬁt may be bad not only for the soul but also for the bottom
line.
Similar experiments by Fehr and others have also established a sys-
tematic tendency for individuals to repay unkind behavior with unkind
behavior even when this brings no beneﬁt to themselves.4 In one exper-
iment with two subjects, the ﬁrst was asked to propose a division of a
prize between the two, while the second could simply accept or reject
the proposal (this is called the ultimatum game). In the event of rejec-
tion neither received anything. Once again subjects were randomly and
anonymously matched on a one-oﬀbasis, so there could be no possible
beneﬁt from present behavior in terms of inﬂuencing future coopera-
tion. It was clear that the second subjects would systematically reject
proposals they thought gave them too small a share, even if by rejecting
the proposal they would receive nothing at all. Such behavior is some-
times known as “cutting oﬀyour nose to spite your face”—a description
that implies it is irrational. But rational or not, it is clearly widespread in

68 • Chapter 4
human nature. Knowing this, the ﬁrst subjects would ensure that they
gave enough to the second subjects to keep the risks of rejection low,
although this rarely implied equal division, especially when the sums of
money at stake were substantial.
Yet another set of experiments conducted in groups suggests that the
presence of strong reciprocators (who not only respond in kind to coop-
erative behavior but also help to punish noncooperation in others, even
at some cost to themselves), may be critical to ensuring that coopera-
tive habits become established. Where the only motive for cooperation
is the past generosity of others and there are no sanctions for cheating,
an initially cooperative group culture may gradually unravel as individu-
als succumb to temptation. But when it is known that aggrieved parties
can take revenge, and will do so even at personal cost, the incidence of
cheating in the experiments shows a sharp decline.5
Strong reciprocity has now been convincingly documented in a wide
array of groups of experimental subjects and across a wide range of
human societies.6 There is also growing evidence about the role of diﬀer-
ent neural mechanisms in inﬂuencing behavior characterized by strong
reciprocity. For instance, subjects given an opportunity to punish oth-
ers for what they perceive as “unfair” behavior tend to have particularly
strong activation in an area of the brain known as the caudate nucleus,
which is associated with pleasurable rewards (and is known to be acti-
vated by substances such as cocaine and nicotine). This suggests that
even if strong reciprocity is not self-interested in the sense of bringing
economic rewards to the subject, it may be psychologically rewarding.
There is also strong activity in the prefrontal cortex when the subjects
know that the punishment will be personally costly to them, suggesting
that the brain is trading oﬀthe costs and the rewards of such punish-
ment in an integrated way.7 It’s important to note, though, that not all
subjects behave in this way; only some display strong reciprocity and,
as we’ll see below, only some need to in order for cooperation in a social
group to be sustained.
Why is reciprocity important for the ability to trust strangers? First, it
explains why the complex web of trust that underlies modern social life
does not unravel as soon as unscrupulous individuals test its strength.
Economist Kaushik Basu describes a simple problem.8 You take a taxi
ride in a large, unfamiliar city, and when you have reached your destina-
tion you pay the driver the amount you owe. You have beneﬁted from the
ride and you will never see the driver again, so why do you bother? (This

How Have We Tamed Our Violent Instincts? • 69
is the kind of question that sometimes gets economists a bad name.∗)9
The answer, very probably, is that you just do: you feel the instinct to
reciprocate, either in the form of a wish to behave decently to a person
who has just behaved decently to you, or because you believe you have a
moral duty to do so (these two are not so very diﬀerent, since the latter
can be described as a wish to behave “correctly” toward someone who
has just behaved correctly toward you). But now suppose you feel no
such instinct, and instead you ask yourself, “What’s in it for me?” You
will probably reason that if you refused to pay, the driver would make a
great fuss, at least embarrassing you in front of bystanders, possibly get-
ting you involved in a ﬁght, and perhaps even leading to trouble with the
police. It’s just not worth the bother for such a small sum. So it seems
that you don’t have to appeal to strong reciprocity as a motive: plain
self-interest is enough to explain your behavior.
But wait. The driver could just as easily make a fuss even if you had
paid, threatening you with embarrassment, a ﬁght, and the police in
order to make you pay up a second time. None of the other parties would
be any the wiser. The driver will never see you again either, so why does
he refrain from trying to wring a second payment out of you? Once again
the answer might be that the driver is moved by strong reciprocity—or he
might just be calculating that you would react violently if he attempted
to cheat you in this way. But why should he expect you to react violently?
However far down the line we go to prove that your behavior or his is
just the consequence of enlightened self-interest, at some point we still
need to appeal to the fact that people behave diﬀerently if they feel they
have been cheated than if they do not. Since nobody else observed the
transaction taking place between the two of you, no third-party enforce-
ment mechanism can explain why that transaction aﬀects how you sub-
sequently behave.
Even when third-party enforcement mechanisms (such as the courts)
do play a role in strengthening the web of trust, strong reciprocity is the
glue that makes these mechanisms credible. Why does the judge make
any attempt to decide the case on its merits instead of simply ﬁnding
in favor of the party who can pay her the most? Again, perhaps she
just does. Or perhaps she is being self-interested, reasoning that if she
takes a bribe she will suﬀer for it. But why should she think that, unless
some other people (those who report her bribe-taking and her colleagues

the philosopher Schopenhauer used to leave a tip on the table at the start of a restaurant
meal to encourage the waiters, but then remove it at the end.

who investigate the allegations) also behave in ways that are sensitive to
the intrinsic facts of the case? Every person in the web who reasons
self-interestedly can do so only on the assumption that someone else,
somewhere, will not be acting according to self-interest alone.
Formal mechanisms for enforcing agreements still need to draw on
some instinctive and uncalculating tendency to repay kindness with
kindness and unkindness with revenge. What such mechanisms can do,
however, is to ensure that a little strong reciprocity goes a long way.
Modern social life depends on a large number of ingenious arrangements
for reinforcing strong reciprocity with self-interest. When we meet and
transact with strangers, we do not always need to ask ourselves end-
less questions about their intrinsic trustworthiness. So long as there are
enforcement mechanisms in place, and so long as there is a good enough
chance that someone somewhere is intrinsically trustworthy, we may not
need to worry whether the stranger at our door or at the checkout of our
shop is genuinely motivated by reciprocity or merely by self-interest.
Either will do for the purpose in hand.10
But questions that would seem paranoid in a reasonably stable and
well-ordered society may be quite reasonable and even essential in a
poor and violent one. Strong reciprocity has also mattered in the history
of humanity because it has enabled hunter-gatherer bands to take the
ﬁrst cautious steps toward conducting exchange with strangers (such
contacts occurred, as we have seen, well before the adoption of agricul-
ture). An itinerant trader making the ﬁrst contact with an isolated band
whose only motivation was self-interest would almost certainly have his
goods stolen and would be lucky to escape with his life. After all, the
band could hardly reason that oﬀering him goods in return would be
of beneﬁt in the long run, since it would have no reason to expect him
to come back again soon, let alone often, given that this was the ﬁrst
time the band had ever seen him. It has surely been strong reciprocity
that, prehistorically, tipped the balance between hostility to strangers
and a cautious willingness to deal with them. Often that open gesture
of friendship will have been betrayed, as many of the Native Americans
who dealt with the ﬁrst European visitors discovered to their terrible
cost. But their case, though tragic, made ultimately less diﬀerence to the
future of human society than the reverse—namely, the discovery that
a willingness to trust others could produce important beneﬁts to both
sides. Had it not been so, modern society as we know it could never have
evolved.

New Light on the Civilizing Process?
Strong reciprocity is an emotion, triggered by the behavior of others. Per-
haps it would be better to call it a family of emotions, namely those that
drive us to do unto others as they have previously done unto us. Our lives
are colored by many emotions, including anger, nostalgia, resentment,
tenderness, jealousy, disgust, infatuation, melancholy, indignation, lust,
embarrassment, envy, terror, sadness, and delight. Not all of these are
terms used by psychologists, but all of them refer to recognizable states
of mind in which we do not always calculate clearly what it is in our own
current best interests to do. Partly because of this, the Western intel-
lectual tradition has a long history of treating the emotions with suspi-
cion, regarding them as something it is the job of reason to subdue. But
recent research suggests this is an even more serious mistake than the
occasional dissidents from that tradition have realized.
The tradition found one of its most powerful modern expressions in
the work of the German sociologist Norbert Elias, whose major work
The Civilizing Process was ﬁrst published in German in 1939 but had
little inﬂuence until its republication and translation into English thirty
years later.11 Elias argued that the decline in interpersonal violence in
post-medieval European societies was part of a deeper transformation
which had two causes. The ﬁrst was the growing inﬂuence of a number
of institutions on incentives for orderly individual behavior: institutions
such as the courts, armies, and ﬁrms. The second was the progressive
extension of certain ideals of behavior—ideals such as self-control, pru-
dence, and good manners—from higher to lower strata of society. The
result of these two tendencies was that honor was gradually edged out by
prudence as an inﬂuence on behavior. Loyalty to kin was gradually sub-
ordinated to norms of impartiality (in the administration of justice, for
instance). Reason came to be seen as more praiseworthy than emotion,
and justice as taking precedence over revenge.
Many aspects of Elias’s theory have been criticized in detail. For exam-
ple, the German ethnologist and cultural anthropologist Hans Peter
Duerr claimed Elias had underestimated the extent and sophistication of
the regulations on social behavior that had existed in Europe since long
before the Middle Ages.12 And the idea that there are irrational bodily
emotions that it is the job of reason to master is hardly modern: it goes
back at least to Plato’s theory of the soul in The Republic and even to
the Pythagoreans before him. None of this was denied by Elias; at issue
was the question whether such regulation had become more extensive

72 • Chapter 4
and eﬀective since the early modern period in Europe. The accumulat-
ing evidence on the decline in levels of interpersonal violence strongly
suggested that the answer was yes (as Manuel Eisner emphasized in his
work on homicide rates), and Elias’s thesis has become enormously inﬂu-
ential. It has framed the discussion of the relative role of institutional
constraints and ideals of behavior for generations of scholars who do
not necessarily recognize the inﬂuence of Elias directly. Gregory Clark,
for instance, has argued in A Farewell to Alms that the Industrial Rev-
olution was due to a transformation of attitudes toward work, saving,
and economic rationality, a transformation brought about by the greater
reproductive success of economically prosperous families, who gradu-
ally spread the values that underlay their success more and more widely
in the social order. He advances this argument against those who would
cite the inﬂuence of more sophisticated institutions: he writes that “by
1200 societies such as England already had all the institutional prereq-
uisites for economic growth emphasized today by the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund,” and implies that what was therefore
lacking was values, attitudes, and beliefs.13
Other arguments have been proposed that appear to strengthen Elias’s
view. Azar Gat has argued that warfare became less attractive once the
alternative, peace, induced real prosperity. For that to happen the world
needed to escape the Malthusian logic in which temporary prosperity
led merely to higher population growth and no real gains in personal
welfare for the population in the long run.14 But once it had happened
it provided a rational incentive for societies so to organize themselves
that the destructive inﬂuence of personal violence was minimized.
That violence has declined spectacularly since prehistory is undeni-
able, as we have seen. But Elias’s view that this occurred because reason
gradually replaced emotion in the conduct of human life now looks mis-
taken. An alternative view has taken shape in recent years, in which rea-
son orders human social life not by replacing emotion but by harnessing
it. Here is why.
Kaushik Basu’s story of the taxi driver, recounted in chapter 3, reminds
us that trust cannot just be the result of self-interested behavior in the
presence of formal institutions of enforcement such as the police and
the courts. In theory, it could happen provided everybody’s behavior
was perfectly transparent to everyone else. Trust would then be what
game theorists call an equilibrium of social behavior, in which people
were trustworthy because they were afraid of punishment by others if
they were not, while those others would punish them for fear of being

How Have We Tamed Our Violent Instincts? • 73
punished in their turn, and so on. Some scholars have argued that this
is precisely how cooperation came about in the past and even how it
is sustained today. The game theorist Ken Binmore, for example, has
argued that the reason why children care for their elderly parents is that
“they would be censured by their community if they were to fail to carry
out the role assigned to them by the social contract,”15 and believes that
mutual surveillance has been eﬀective enough in human communities
since prehistoric times to keep social trust in place most of the time.
However, the taxi driver story reminds us that so long as there are
some interactions which are not perfectly transparent to everyone else,
it requires somebody somewhere in the chain to be behaving according to
strong reciprocity, otherwise nobody would have a purely self-interested
motive for cooperating in these contexts at all. Herbert Gintis has per-
suasively argued that, if everyone were strictly self-interested, even small
degrees of imperfection in the ability to observe other people’s behavior
would lead to a complete breakdown of cooperation in groups of even
quite modest size.16 Thieves could be kept in check only by an honest
police force, and the police could be kept honest only by the vigilance of
the citizenry, and the citizens could be kept vigilant only by the further
ceaseless vigilance of their neighbors, and so on. In the end everyone
would be punishing each other all the time for erroneously perceived
infractions of the mutual vigilance code, as in some dystopian fantasy
we might call Switzerland Squared.
This is a serious problem for any attempt to explain the evolution of
cooperation on the basis of calculation alone, even in hunter-gatherer
bands. It’s true that, unlike in modern societies, most hunter-gatherers
would have interacted most of the time with people they would expect
to see again, even when these people were not close kin. Still, many peo-
ple would have found themselves often alone and unobserved, in cir-
cumstances in which there were signiﬁcant gains from cheating on the
group. The circumstances of hunting and gathering—an uncertain envi-
ronment, in which the location of game and plant food, and the eﬀort
necessary to secure it, were constantly unpredictable—would have made
that inevitable. Small groups would set out into the forest, would split
up and rejoin each other; some individuals would head oﬀin a variety
of directions to cut oﬀthe escape of the prey, and so on. Someone who
found an unexpected store of honey or berries could easily have eaten
some and hidden the rest without telling the others. But if cheating were
easy, suspicion and mistaken retaliation would almost certainly have
been widespread.

74 • Chapter 4
But even a small amount of strong reciprocity would have been enough
to make cooperation attractive, even (or especially) to those who were
not themselves reciprocators. Even the purely self-interested anticipate
the reactions of others who are reciprocators. It’s remarkable how little
yeast can raise so much dough. In fact, given the presence of even a
few reciprocators, the self-interest of the rest of their fellow citizens
becomes a force acting for trust rather than against it. What some see
as the coldness and predictability of calculation becomes an important
virtue. As Scobie remarks in Graham Greene’s novel The Heart of the
Matter (1971, p. 55):
“They had been corrupted by money, and he had been corrupted by
sentiment. Sentiment was the more dangerous, because you couldn’t
name its price. A man open to bribes was to be relied upon below a
certain ﬁgure, but sentiment might uncoil in the heart at a name, a
photograph, even a smell remembered.”
In short, calculation and strong reciprocity have complementary virtues;
each harnesses the other in the service of social trust.
Smiling, Laughter, and the Need for Signals of Trust
It’s worth asking what exactly are these complementary virtues of calcu-
lation and strong reciprocity. Calculation enables an individual to trust
only those others she can aﬀord, on best evidence, to trust, and to do no
more for others than is strictly in her own best interest. It’s an essential
ability for an individual facing a variable natural environment and a com-
plex social environment. It is likely that the increasing size of individ-
ual brains over the last six or seven million years reﬂected the selective
pressures arising from a more diverse ecology and the growing size of
social groups. Only individuals who could calculate well, who could judge
how their behavior should be adapted to ﬁt diﬀerent circumstances, who
could spot a cheat, were likely to survive to reproduce. And there is good
evidence that human beings have senses very ﬁnely tuned to signals of
the trustworthiness of those around them. In one famous experiment,
the psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby showed that subjects
often had diﬃculty solving a logical puzzle which required them to iden-
tify playing cards that failed to conform to a rule of play (this is called
the Wason selection task). However, when the very same logical puzzle
was reformulated as a problem of identifying people who had failed to
conform to a rule of social behavior, the subjects performed very much

How Have We Tamed Our Violent Instincts? • 75
better on the test. This led Cosmides and Tooby to conclude that our
reasoning abilities are sensitive to context in ways that would have been
beneﬁcial for our ability to spot cheats during our evolutionary history.17
But calculation is not a virtue that necessarily inspires conﬁdence in
others. Suppose I know you have a shrewd nose for your own best inter-
est, and nothing but. Then I may be cautious about cheating you, but I
shall also be cautious about trusting you. I shall not make spontaneous
gestures of friendship, for I know that these will make no diﬀerence to
your subsequent treatment of me, which will be based solely upon calcu-
lation of your future interest. Pure calculation, in other words, exercises
trust wisely but does little to inspire it.
Strong reciprocity, almost by deﬁnition, is less wise. It inspires indi-
viduals to be generous to others purely to repay past generosity, even
when this brings no future beneﬁt. It can also trap individuals in cycles
of revenge generated by past wrongs. Based on emotion that is triggered
by outside events rather than the conscious decisions of the individual,
strong reciprocity is open to manipulation by others. But when it comes
to inspiring trust in others, its insensitivity to calculation is precisely
its strength.18 If I know that my present generosity to you will incline
you to help me in the future, regardless of your interests at the time,
I shall be more likely to take the risk of helping you. Your disposition
for strong reciprocity makes you a more credible partner than someone
who has no such disposition. This character, in short, gives you a power
of commitment beyond the reach of the most sophisticated calculation.
It is a power that the calculating can appreciate even though they can-
not aspire to it—calculators would rather trust reciprocators than trust
other calculators like themselves.
These considerations suggest that individuals who can simultaneously
exercise trust shrewdly and inspire trust in others need to have some dis-
position for calculation in their dealings with others—but not too much,
or no one will trust them. They also need some disposition for strong
reciprocity—but not too much, or others will exploit them, and the mem-
ory of past wrongs will cast too long a shadow on their lives. They need
a way to signal to others that they have the element of strong reciprocity
that makes them trustworthy, and they need to signal it in a way that any
purely calculating person could not convincingly mimic. The psycholo-
gists Michael Owren and Jo-Anne Bachorowski have proposed an inge-
nious theory according to which smiling and laughter may have evolved
in human beings as just such signals.19 Both smiling and laughter are
human capacities for which only fairly rudimentary forms exist in other

76 • Chapter 4
species.20 Both appear to signal emotions associated with a liking for
others and a willingness to behave generously toward them—what psy-
chologists call “positive aﬀect.”21 Both appear to trigger such feelings
in others as well.22 Owren and Bachorowski suggest that the capacity of
smiling and laughter to act as reliable signals of positive aﬀect, and there-
fore of trustworthiness, would have made them highly adaptive for the
individuals that could smile and laugh. Any genetic mutations favoring
such capabilities would therefore have tended to spread. Given their reli-
ability as signals of trustworthiness, evolution would also have tended
to favor a tendency to respond warmly to them in turn.23
However, any signal that makes other people think I am trustworthy is
one it would be highly useful for me to be able to fake. That way I could
make people trust me, and do favors for me, without incurring the cost
of doing favors for them in return unless it suited me to do so. So, Owren
and Bachorowski suggest, no sooner had smiling become reasonably well
established as a reliable signal of trustworthiness than it also became
adaptive to be able to counterfeit smiles. Smiles that are under deliberate
control are known to use a diﬀerent set of neural circuitry than spon-
taneous smiles (the latter are also known as “Duchenne” smiles, after
the nineteenth-century psychologist who ﬁrst wrote about the diﬀer-
ence). Not everyone can fake smiles successfully—indeed, politicians are
predominantly drawn from among those human beings who can. Many
people (myself included) are eﬀectively barred from political careers by
their inability to produce convincing smiles to order for the camera. But
enough people can do so to suggest that the evolution of smile mimicry
has proceeded quite far in the human species.
But almost nobody can fake laughter convincingly. Many people are
unable to discriminate reliably between spontaneous smiles and those
produced by good actors. But virtually everyone can tell the diﬀerence
between spontaneous laughter and the deliberate laughter of even very
talented actors. And deliberate laughter provokes much less positive
aﬀect in those that hear it than does spontaneous laughter. These facts
lead Owren and Bachorowski to suggest that laughter probably evolved
later than smiling (no doubt in response to the mimicry of the ﬁrst
prehistoric politicians). The fact that smiling was losing its reliability,
because so many people could fake it, made it valuable to have another,
better signal of positive aﬀect. And the possibility that laughter evolved
later would explain why the ability to fake convincingly has not yet had
time to evolve.

How Have We Tamed Our Violent Instincts? • 77
A telling piece of evidence in support of the signaling theory of laugh-
ter is the way in which, across all kinds of cultures in the world, people
who have made a business deal with each other tend to seal the deal by
having a drink together. Drinking alcohol notoriously aﬀects people’s
judgment. In fact, alcohol is a depressant that not only makes people
feel all stimuli less strongly but particularly diminishes people’s sensi-
tivity to pains, including future pains.24 (The reason why alcohol pro-
vokes car accidents is not primarily that it slows down people’s reaction
times but that it makes them reckless, through diminished sensitivity to
future dangers.) In short, if people entering into a business relationship
needed to keep a clear head in order to work out carefully how much
they could aﬀord to trust their new partners, having a drink together
would be the worst possible way to seal a deal.25 But alcohol is also,
famously, a disinhibitor. Most importantly, it makes many people laugh.
In all cultures, many business people spend evenings exchanging jokes
that, to begin with, virtually nobody ﬁnds funny, but at which everyone,
toward the end of the evening, is laughing uproariously. At the same
time that it disables people’s capacity for exercising trust wisely, alco-
hol is enabling people to inspire trust by stimulating an excellent signal
of positive aﬀect, namely laughter, that is not under direct voluntary
control.26
Mimicry should not always be considered, though, as tending to
weaken or undermine trust. One of the ﬁrst kinds of social interaction of
which babies are capable at just a few weeks of age is to return the smiles
of those who have smiled at them. All of us learn at the very start of life
that smiles are the sign of the love and goodwill of our relatives, partic-
ularly our parents. The ﬁrst traders that successfully made contact with
hunter-gatherer bands and persuaded them to exchange instead of to
ﬁght must have tried very hard to smile convincingly in order to trigger
a reciprocity response. Without some degree of successful mimicry such
exchanges might never have got going. Here, as in many other contexts,
trusting strangers is a process of conscious and unconscious mimicry of
the way in which we trust our family and friends.
Trust and the Emotions
As we have seen, human beings do not decide to cooperate purely as a
matter of intellectual judgment about the likely consequences of doing
so. The existence of strong reciprocity shows that many people can be
induced to cooperate purely by the generosity of others, independently

78 • Chapter 4
of any beneﬁts they may thereby gain. Furthermore, cooperative behav-
ior is not just under the control of the calculating parts of the brain.
Recent studies have shown that the hormone oxytocin increases the will-
ingness of human subjects to trust others, in experiments in which they
have to decide whether to send money to another in the hope of receiv-
ing a larger sum in return. But oxytocin does not work its harmonious
magic simply by making people more optimistic or less concerned about
risk: under its inﬂuence, subjects are willing to send money to other
human subjects but not (say) to a machine whose behavior they have
to predict.27 The brain still needs to work out that it is facing another
person, and then trust becomes a fully social judgment, in which intel-
lectual and emotional elements are very closely intertwined. This makes
them subject to manipulation, but the manipulation of the emotions of
others is as central to human interaction as the manipulation of their
beliefs, which is what we do all the time. It’s called communication.
We can now return to Elias’s view of the civilizing process, and see
the element that is missing from his story. Reducing levels of violence
in human society has required us not to sideline the emotions but to
harness them. In particular, strong reciprocity is the glue that makes
calculating individuals decide they can aﬀord to trust the institutions
of justice in a world in which the truth is only imperfectly observed.
Emotions may involve a risk of irrational behavior, but without them
human cooperation could not get oﬀthe ground at all.28 Indeed, there
is evidence that violence can be more, not less common in the absence
of certain natural emotional responses between strangers. In the famous
Stanford Prison Experiment conducted in 1971, where volunteers played
the roles of guards and prisoners (an experiment that had to be aborted
because of the growing brutality of the treatment of prisoners by the
guards), the guards wore silver reﬂecting glasses and military uniforms
that helped to weaken the recognition of individuals and any emotional
responses that might have softened their treatment. Philip Zimbardo,
who conducted the experiment, reports an eery parallel with a guard
at Abu Graib who painted his face silver and black, and interrogators
who removed their name tags, in apparent attempts to remove all trace
of individuality from their encounters with prisoners with whom they
expected to behave aggressively.29
Emotions can be manipulated for malign ends, but they can also be
manipulated in the interests of human solidarity and trust. Thanks to
our emotional makeup we can be inﬂuenced by incentives to play our
part in the great collaborative enterprise that is modern human society.

How Have We Tamed Our Violent Instincts? • 79
Later in this book we shall see how these incentives are embodied in a
range of institutions that make social collaboration an attractive option
even for the least public-spirited among us (contrary to Gregory Clark’s
view, modern economic life is not just the fruit of changing values and
beliefs). But before we do so we still need to ask a fundamental question:
where did the curious psychological makeup of humanity come from?
It’s clear why a talent for calculation would have been adaptive in prehis-
toric times. But strong reciprocity is another matter: cooperating even
when it’s not in your interests to do so doesn’t sound like a strategy for
leaving lots of descendants. Merely being essential for a future experi-
ment in civilization would not have been enough to make it so. So why
and how did strong reciprocity evolve? What helped the strong recipro-
cators among our ancestors to survive in a hostile world?

How Did the Social Emotions Evolve?
Three Explanations for the Evolution of
Strong Reciprocity
For social primates like us, navigating a room full of other members
of our species requires us to launch the shaky vessel of our psyche
onto an unpredictable hormonal tide. Where are the people we know?
As we scan the horizon our cortisol levels rise, and blood pressure rises
too. There’s a wash of oxytocin as a friend moves into view—she did us
such a kind favor the other day. But then, when she fails to notice us,
the stress returns. Was it a deliberate snub? Or would it be worse if it
was unintentional? An adrenaline rush now as we spot a rival we hadn’t
expected to see—will he come over for a challenge? He drifts away, the
adrenaline fades, and the cortisol creeps up again as we wonder whether
that means we’re too insigniﬁcant to be worth worrying about. Then
we spot someone else who let us down last week, and the indignation
mounts; cortisol levels decline and the blood pressure falls too as we
plot how to retaliate.1 In a few short moments we have been distracted
by several reminders of recent events: people who have been kind to us,
people who have let us down, people who may be snubbing us, people
to whom our endocrine system is urging us to react. Wouldn’t it be eas-
ier if instead of dwelling on the past we could just rationally evaluate
the future and decide what it was in our best interests to do? Surely the
solitary orangutan has an easier life.
It’s not just our sex hormones that complicate our lives and lead us
do things we may later regret. As group-living primates we are intensely
sensitive to slights, to tiny diﬀerences in status, to favors given and
returned, to omissions and snubs. Our responses to these things are
not just based on calculation but on powerful feeling, and they some-
times assume an importance out of proportion to anything our calculat-
ing brains can justify. They can literally make us sick with anxiety: stud-
ies of British civil servants over many years have shown that low relative

How Did the Social Emotions Evolve? • 81
status (and an associated history of being pushed around by others in
the workplace) is associated with heightened risk of stress-related ill-
nesses such as cardiac disease.2 Preliminary research on monkeys also
suggests that obesity in low-status individuals may come about partly
because certain kinds of high-calorie food block the receptors of stress
hormones in our brains, so that our stress responses may make us more
vulnerable to the allure of junk food.3 But even if they don’t make us
sick they often lead us to act in ways that just don’t seem in our own
best interests. Why have we evolved to be like this? Is it a design ﬂaw in
the psychology of Homo sapiens sapiens?
Researchers are still puzzling over this question.4 To understand their
puzzlement, let’s focus just on those emotions that support strong
reciprocity, though similar arguments could be made about the oth-
ers (for instance, recent research has suggested that a genetic predis-
position to attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder may have arisen as
a result of selection for exploratory behavior in nomadic groups dur-
ing prehistory).5 The fact that, in the laboratory, people are willing to
incur personal costs to reward those who have treated them well and
punish those who have treated them badly even when these people will
never knowingly see them again, has led some researchers to suppose
that strong reciprocity is an evolutionary “mistake.”6 It would have been
more adaptive, according to this view, to evolve a tendency to show reci-
procity only toward those you are likely to see again (we could call peo-
ple with such a tendency “opportunists”).7 However, asking why strong
reciprocity evolved may be a little like asking why human males have
developed a desire to have sex with beautiful females who are currently
using contraception. Obviously an evolutionary mistake (if only all mis-
takes were so enjoyable). But not such a surprising mistake, since what
evolved was a desire to have sex with beautiful females, period. Reliable
contraception arrived on the scene far too late in evolutionary history
to have created any kind of adaptive pressure for a more discriminating
desire, directed only toward those currently not taking contraception.
Perhaps the evolution of strong reciprocity is no more of a puzzle than
this.
Since Professor Ernst Fehr and his fellow experimenters have arrived
on the scene even later in evolutionary history than the contraceptive
pill, it is evident that whatever else strong reciprocity may be, it cannot
helpfully be described as a tendency to return in kind the behavior of
others whom the experimenter has ensured we shall never knowingly see
again. It is a tendency to return in kind the behavior of others, period.

82 • Chapter 5
So were our ancestors often enough exposed to people whom they had
reason to believe they would never see again for there to have been some
real selective pressure against strong reciprocity over evolutionary time?
This remains a hotly debated question.8 One possibility is that they were
not, that most people who were generous to our ancestors were peo-
ple they had at least some reason to expect to see again in the future.
Although our ancestors were certainly highly wary of strangers, most of
whom would have been hostile if not lethal, friendly strangers may have
been a great rarity, certainly unusual enough for there to be no great
adaptive pressure in favor of cheating them. Indeed, friendly strangers
can be thought of as successful mimics of our genuine friends, successful
because of their comparative rarity until very recent times. This implies
in turn that selective pressure against reciprocity and in favor of oppor-
tunism has been operating for too short a time to have become dominant
in human populations—the experimental evidence suggests that a pro-
portion of subjects display reciprocity, not that they all do.9 In short,
reciprocators and opportunists coexist, and they did so even in prehis-
toric times because the behavior they engaged in wasn’t very diﬀerent.
A second possible explanation for the evolution of strong reciprocity
is that there was indeed some real selective pressure against it at an indi-
vidual level, but that this was oﬀset by the adaptive beneﬁts to groups
that displayed strong reciprocity. Such groups might be better placed to
trade with others, for instance, or might be more cohesive in intergroup
warfare. The anthropologist Sarah Blaﬀer Hrdy has recently argued that
the real beneﬁts came via our ability to engage in cooperative child
care, which is strikingly diﬀerent from the practice of the other great
apes.10 Group selection theories have attracted renewed support in biol-
ogy and the human sciences recently, though they have also generated
fervent opposition. Might this be an example where they could usefully
be applied?11
Because there has been so much controversy over the plausibility of
group selection, let me suggest a simple way to think about it, which
emphasizes that it is not, as it sometimes appears to be, a departure
from the principles of gene selection. We can compare the eﬀects on
behavior of two rival versions (“alleles”) of a gene, given the average envi-
ronment in which they are expressed (they might of course have quite
diﬀerent eﬀects in a diﬀerent environment; as Steve Jones has written,
if everybody smoked, lung cancer would be a genetic disease12). One of
these versions will be selected in preference to the other if the behavior
it causes results in there being more copies made of itself than there

How Did the Social Emotions Evolve? • 83
are copies of the rival allele. This is what is meant by saying that all
natural selection is gene selection; any talk of individual selection or
group selection just refers to one of the possible mechanisms by which
gene selection takes place. However, the behavior can have this result
in two ways. The ﬁrst is by helping the individual bearing it to repro-
duce, thus creating more copies of itself directly. Though often called
individual selection this should not be understood as an alternative to
gene selection but rather as one of the mechanisms of gene selection:
gene selection via the reproduction of the bearer individuals. The sec-
ond is by helping some other individual bearing that gene to reproduce,
thereby creating more copies of itself indirectly. All of the theories that
purport to explain the evolution of traits of cooperative behavior (such
as strong reciprocity) do so by explaining why a gene that does not help
its bearer to reproduce might nevertheless cause more copies of itself
to be made indirectly by helping another bearer of the gene to repro-
duce. Each theory proposes a diﬀerent reason why the beneﬁciaries of
the cooperative behavior might be more likely than average members of
the population to be carriers of the gene.
The ﬁrst and best-known such theory is that of kin selection, accord-
ing to which cooperative behavior directed towards an individual’s close
relatives has a chance of helping copies of itself to be made because
these individuals are likely to be bearers of the gene in question through
their shared ancestry. The theory of group selection proposes a diﬀerent
reason why the beneﬁciaries of the cooperation might be more likely to
be bearers of the gene. Cooperative behavior helps other members of the
group. Suppose there are some random factors that determine the distri-
bution of individuals bearing the cooperative gene across groups in the
population. Suppose that these factors result in there often being “clus-
ters” of such individuals: that is, instead of every group having more or
less the same proportion of cooperators, some groups have many and
other groups have few. Then because of the clustering, most cooperators
will ﬁnd themselves in groups with other cooperators. A similar process
explains why most people who ﬂy tend to perceive their ﬂights as more
crowded than the average: if some ﬂights are crowded while others are
not, there are fewer people who will notice the uncrowded ﬂight and
more who will notice the crowded one. In fact, if half the ﬂights are full
and the other half are empty, the average ﬂight is only half full, but
everyone who travels does so on a full ﬂight.
Thus, if the behavior of cooperators creates a big beneﬁt to the other
cooperators with whom they are clustered, it is likely to lead to more

84 • Chapter 5
copies of the gene being produced in spite of its cost to the individual.
Those without the cooperative gene will do better than cooperators in
the same situation, but they are likely (because of the clustering) to ﬁnd
themselves with fewer cooperators in their groups, so they will do worse
overall.
The third possible explanation for the evolution of strong reciprocity
also appeals to the clustering eﬀect, but suggests reasons why this may
happen other than just the randomness of distribution across groups.
Clustering of cooperators may happen because they are drawn to each
other.13 In other words, opportunists may do better than reciprocators
when they get a chance to cheat, but unless they can hide the fact that
they are opportunists, they may be given fewer opportunities to cheat
in the ﬁrst place. They may face collective ostracism from the reciproca-
tors within their group.14 Or they may just be less attractive as mates,
business partners, or friends. This explanation is like the group selec-
tion story, in that it makes the spread of strong reciprocity depend on
the fact that reciprocators tend to ﬁnd themselves in groups with other
reciprocators. However, it depends on some means by which reciproca-
tors may be able to recognize each other and reinforce the clustering
process.
Overall, therefore, we need to remember that all selection is selection
of genes. What is sometimes called “individual selection” can also be
called “gene selection through the eﬀect of the gene on the reproduction
of the individual bearing it.” What is sometimes called “kin selection”
can also be called “gene selection through the eﬀect of the gene on the
reproduction of the bearer’s relatives who are likely to carry copies of
the gene.” And what is sometimes called “group selection” can also be
called “gene selection through the eﬀect of the gene on the reproduction
of other members of the bearer’s group who are likely to carry copies of
the gene.”
How can we use evidence to choose between these three compet-
ing explanations for the ability of genes favoring cooperative behavior
to spread through the population at the expense of rival genes favor-
ing uncooperative behavior? I suggested in chapter 4 that it did not
seem likely that in prehistoric times calculators and strong reciproca-
tors would have behaved in exactly the same way. Put simply, even in a
small hunter-gatherer band there would have been too many opportuni-
ties to cheat. It’s hard to believe the “evolutionary mistake” explanation
for strong reciprocity. However, some scholars argue that we need very

How Did the Social Emotions Evolve? • 85
strong evidence for alternative explanations before we can reject those
based on purely individual selection.
So what about group selection? Several scholars have recently argued
that conditions in hunter-gatherer societies were quite favorable to
the emergence of cooperative behavior under group selection.15 For
instance, the frequency of warfare—Samuel Bowles has estimated the
average risk of death from violence at 14% among hunter-gatherers—
made the diﬀerence between eﬀective cooperation and the lack of it a
matter literally of life and death.16 Together with evidence about the
diversity of average genotypes across groups in the population (of “clus-
tering,” in other words), Bowles suggests this shows that even quite
costly forms of cooperative behavior could have been favored by group
selection. It is hard to know exactly how much the kind of strong reci-
procity documented in economic experiments would have contributed
to the probability of a group’s survival under the conditions of hunter-
gatherer warfare. But so far at least the evidence seems consistent with a
role for group selection, given the violent conditions of hunter-gatherer
existence, and there will undoubtedly be much more research exploring
this possibility in the near future.
Of course, anything that favored clustering, by enabling reciprocators
to recognize each other and choose to cooperate together, would also
have favored the evolution of strong reciprocity by natural selection.
Here it is harder to ﬁnd ﬁrm evidence, but it’s certainly plausible that
intrinsically trustworthy individuals would have tried to seek each other
out, as I suggested when discussing the evolution of smiling and laugh-
ter. It’s more diﬃcult to know how much option individuals had to
choose those with whom they cooperated, and therefore to avoid becom-
ing involved in cooperative activities with those whom they suspected
of being opportunists. It may also be that other characteristics (strength
or intelligence, for instance) made more diﬀerence to people’s attrac-
tiveness as partners in cooperative activities than whether they were
reciprocators or opportunists. The ﬂuidity of coalitions in chimpanzee
societies, for instance, has been documented in gripping detail by the
primatologist Frans de Waal,17 but strong reciprocity doesn’t look like
the ﬁrst quality a chimp would need to do well in the hierarchy.
A possible alternative is that a demonstrated talent for cooperative
behavior was important to groups seeking husbands for their daughters,
since in prehistoric human groups (as in groups of chimpanzees) it was
usually the adolescent females who left the parental home to ﬁnd mates.
However, the idea that this might have provided a signiﬁcant source of

86 • Chapter 5
selective pressure in favor of strong reciprocity, while theoretically pos-
sible, remains a conjecture as a point of fact.18 It’s safe to say that this
question will occupy economists, anthropologists and primatologists for
a long time to come. And we can safely agree that we owe the astonishing
complexity of modern society to the presence of at least some recipro-
cators among our ancestors, as well as to those unrecorded heroes of
prehistory who risked slaughter at the hands of strangers to explore the
opportunities for mutually beneﬁcial trade.
Whatever the explanation, it will not necessarily imply that any partic-
ular form of strong reciprocity is hardwired into the human brain. There
has been much controversy in recent years over the arguments of some
evolutionary psychologists that natural selection has given the human
brain a large number of very precise cognitive modules, which were adap-
tive in prehistoric times but may no longer be adaptive in modern soci-
eties. A potential example of such a module is the talent for “cheater
detection” demonstrated by the Wason selection task discussed in chap-
ter 4. There is controversy over the interpretation of these ﬁndings,19
but however that controversy is resolved it will remain an open ques-
tion to what extent our talents for cheater detection are developed from
experience in childhood as opposed to being present in our brains from
birth. Performing the Wason selection task on adults tells us nothing
about this.
To see why, consider a task I perform on groups of students each year.
I show them a photograph taken in rural Africa showing a group of peo-
ple standing around a trestle table on which there are some pieces of
cloth. I ask the students what is happening in the photograph. The stu-
dents all realize it is a market, so I ask them next who is buying and
who is selling. The students all identify without hesitation the buyers
and the seller, but when pressed as to how they know, they have some
diﬃculty in answering. They eventually realize it is because of the posi-
tion of the subjects’ eyes: the buyers are looking at the cloth, while the
seller is looking at the buyers. What is interesting about this test is that it
shows we all have a very sophisticated ability to size up social situations
(using the position of people’s eyes, for instance, to determine the eco-
nomic relations between them); so sophisticated, indeed, that we know
what the social relationships are before we know how we know. But it
seems unlikely that we have a “market-relations-detection-mechanism”
hardwired in our brains. Hunter-gatherers knew about cheats but they
would not often have found themselves in markets. Instead it makes
sense to infer that we have a sophisticated talent for sizing up social

How Did the Social Emotions Evolve? • 87
relationships, and that we apply this talent to learning which social rela-
tionships have economic signiﬁcance for us. Similarly, the likelihood that
natural selection has given us—or at least some of us—a tendency to
behave in ways characterized by strong reciprocity tells us nothing about
the share of inheritance and learning in the development of that behav-
ior. We may be—some of us—programmed to reciprocate more or less
independently of what we learn in childhood. Or we may just be pro-
grammed to learn to respond to others in ways that adults around us
teach us to follow—reciprocity being an understandable characteristic
for others to want to instill in us.
Reciprocity and Revenge
Strong reciprocity can of course be dangerous, and not just when it is
manipulated. Certainly, it helps to establish cooperation and exchange.
This is partly because of the tendency to repay kindness with kind-
ness, and partly because the tendency to repay unkindness with revenge
makes people more likely to keep their promises. But this second char-
acteristic also means that once promises are broken, the participants
can become trapped in a cycle of revenge. Testimonies to this from his-
tory, anthropology, and imaginative literature are legion. Modern tragedy
has often located dramatic compulsion within human beings’ own iron
subjection to the laws of revenge, which endows the action with a sense
of inevitability in works such as Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and
Gabriel García Márquez’s Chronicle of a Death Foretold. The codes of
honor of the Maﬁa culture of Sicily have come to seem strangely dys-
functional in the modern world, but they have a comprehensible ratio-
nale, as the work of sociologist Diego Gambetta has shown us.20 Gam-
betta emphasizes the way in which Maﬁa families originally took upon
themselves the role of providing some of the underpinnings of trust in
a complex modern society, because the Italian state proved incapable of
doing so in Sicily at the time of Italy’s uniﬁcation in the mid nineteenth
century. But this role came at a heavy cost: the same human motiva-
tions that can reinforce a culture of trust can also entrench a culture
of distrust. In Sicily’s case, trust of insiders has reinforced distrust of
outsiders, a cultural handicap that has cost the region dear as it seeks
to integrate itself into modern Italy and the modern world.
Fortunately, the disposition to trust in members of a certain group
more than others has often been a help, not a hindrance, in widening the
range of people on whom we can rely. An unknown trader coming into

88 • Chapter 5
our village may suﬀer from being an outsider to our group, but he may
beneﬁt from belonging to some other group or tribe with some of whose
members we have previously dealt or to a more distant branch of our
own tribe; he may even come with tokens or letters of recommendation.
To this day, immigrants to North America often seek out members of
their own ethnic community; migrants from the countryside to Indian
cities often contact members of their own caste; the stranger at my door
stands a better chance of admission if he is wearing the uniform of a
reputable company.
The gradual integration of local cultures of trust into larger regional,
national, or even global cultures of trust, punctuated though it has been
by many episodes of reversal, is at the heart of the history of modern
life. It is important not to romanticize this process: when I say I can
trust a stranger, I do not mean that I like him, have any curiosity about
him as a person, or care in any deep sense about what happens to him.
The point is that I do not need to like or care about him in order to be
able to deal conﬁdently and reliably with him. Some people have seen
in this fact a chilling, even dehumanizing quality of modern societies
and have yearned for the times when those who mattered to us were
those we knew, people whom we might hate or love but to whom we
could not feel indiﬀerent. The economist James Buchanan has described
how a purchase of fruit at a roadside stall can take place in spite of
the fact that neither of the people concerned has any particular inter-
est in the well-being of the other: they are “able to…transact exchanges
eﬃciently because both parties agree on the property rights relevant to
them.” In reply the economist Samuel Bowles describes this as creat-
ing “a psychological environment of anonymity, indiﬀerence to others,
mobility, lack of commitment, autonomy” and concludes that “we learn
to function in these environments, and in doing so we become someone
we might not have become in a diﬀerent setting.”21 People vary in how
much this troubles them (Bowles is pointing out that anonymous mar-
kets have an important eﬀect, though not necessarily one we should, on
balance, regret). But it is absolutely clear that a warmer timbre of human
interaction in all our encounters is quite incompatible with the degree
of complex interaction upon which most of us now depend.
Indeed, it is precisely the most tenuous, the most anonymous, of our
links to the outside world that do most to connect us to new opportu-
nities. The powerful implications of this simple fact were drawn by the
sociologist Mark Granovetter in a famous article entitled “The Strength
of Weak Ties.” Granovetter began by reporting a study of the social

How Did the Social Emotions Evolve? • 89
networks that helped unemployed people to ﬁnd jobs. Personal contacts
are often a more important means of ﬁnding work than formal institu-
tions such as employment exchanges. Yet Granovetter found that people
were much less likely to ﬁnd work through close friends (their “strong
ties”) than through casual acquaintances (their “weak ties”), even though
close friends should in principle have more reason to help them. The
reason is that your close friends are likely to know many of the same
people that you do; they are therefore less likely to be able to bring
you genuinely new information and opportunities.22 Casual acquain-
tances, in contrast, are more likely to act as a bridge between otherwise
closed groups and the outside world. Granovetter’s article, and other
work inspired by it, have provided a welcome counterweight to the ele-
giac strain in sociology,23 which has spoken of the alienation induced by
modern living without noting how this is linked to the very conditions
that give it energy and creativity.
Of the impersonal institutions that have enabled this gradual integra-
tion of local cultures of trust into a wider culture governing relations
between strangers, none has been more central to the process than the
institution of property rights. Property rights are a set of rules govern-
ing who has the right to manage the various valuable resources in our
environment, to enjoy their fruits, and to dispose of them to others.
Without the assurance that the resources you theoretically own now will
be protected from marauders until the time comes for you to repay me,
no amount of trust in your good intentions may induce me to be gen-
erous to you today. Another way to express this is that trust cannot be
purely bilateral: trust between any two people rests on a web of trust
between each of them and the others with whom they also deal. For
this reason, as we shall see in later chapters, all societies have needed
the maintenance of defense, civil order, and some degree of consensus
about what the social rules decree. Some historians have even argued
that the ability to establish such property rights, and the social con-
sensus that enables them to be enforced, is the single most cogent
explanation for why some countries (such as Britain and the Nether-
lands) were able to industrialize and grow faster than others at a critical
period in early modern history.24 As with other institutions, property
rights rest on a delicate balance between reciprocity and self-interest,
and diﬀerent societies have placed diﬀerent emphasis on the formal
and the informal (or consensual) components of that balance. A grow-
ing literature on what has come to be called “social capital” examines
the many subtle factors that explain why trust appears to have become

90 • Chapter 5
more securely embedded in some societies than in others.25 What all
stable societies have in common, though, is that the balance between
reciprocity and self-interest holds even when unscrupulous individuals
test its strength.
It is time to look more closely at some of the social institutions that
have been responsible for this extraordinary spread of the willingness
to trust strangers. The hallmark of the most successful of these insti-
tutions is their ability to entrench a culture of trust with a minimum of
explicit enforcement. For instance, what distinguishes safe cities from
dangerous, crime-ridden ones? Jane Jacobs has written that “the public
peace—the street peace and sidewalk peace—of cities is not kept primar-
ily by the police, necessary as police are. It is kept primarily by an intri-
cate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards
among the people themselves, and enforced by the people themselves.”
Indeed, she argued, “once a street is well equipped to handle strangers,
once it has both a good, eﬀective demarcation between private and pub-
lic spaces and has a basic supply of activity and eyes, the more strangers
the merrier.”26 In other words, cities need an institution of peacekeeping,
doubtless backed by formal sanctions but largely informal in its day-to-
day activity. And that institution has to be stable, in the sense that people
react to its presence by behaving more, not less, cooperatively.
We shall look in more detail at cities in chapter 10. But ﬁrst we shall
look at one of the most remarkable trust-creating institutions of all, one
that no sane person would take seriously for a moment were it not for
the fact that everyone else in society is normally quite willing to do so.
It is money.

Money and Human Relationships
Money and Barter
In northwestern Russia a man and a woman are bartering goods, each
oﬀering something they have made against something they want. This
is the way goods have been exchanged for most of the human past, and
it epitomizes the traditional culture of face-to-face interactions. What
are they exchanging? Animal skins, it turns out, against rather simple
shoes. You could be forgiven for imagining the scene as taking place in a
forest clearing, or at the side of a muddy track, with horses occasionally
stamping their feet and launching clouds of breath into the winter air.
In fact, the woman is sitting in a heated oﬃce, and the man is nowhere
to be seen. They are talking on the telephone.
It is February 1992. The consignments whose exchange they are nego-
tiating are far too large to ﬁt on a horse and must be sent for several
hundred miles across the frozen landscape by container truck. Almost
everything about the transaction speaks of the industrial age: the ani-
mal skins have been scalded with chemicals, the shoes have been cut
and stitched by machine, the goods will be accompanied by invoices and
bills of lading, the man and the woman are dressed in machine-made
clothes and work by the glare of strip-lights. Only one thing is preindus-
trial: they refuse to use money. Inﬂation is currently running at 2,000
per cent per year, and the money would lose its value faster than they
could pass it on.
Throughout the decade that followed the end of communism, barter
took the place of money for a remarkable proportion of transactions in
a society that in most other respects had been seeking to model itself
on the market economies of the industrialized West. These were not
just deals between individuals trading household goods or personal ser-
vices (a well-known phenomenon under communism). Firms were trad-
ing commodities with each other instead of trading them for money,
and doing so at all stages and all scales of production. No goods were

too large or too sophisticated to be part of a barter exchange; tanks, air-
plane engines, and oil and gas reﬁnery equipment all featured in such
deals.
Understanding how a modern society can function without money tells
us a great deal about the role money plays in more normal times. For
make no mistake: living without money during that crucial decade cost
Russian society very dear.1 There were some obvious costs: the man who
receives shoes in exchange for his animal skins could not possibly use
so many shoes, not even by distributing some of them to his workers
(who would probably have preferred other things, though they were in no
position to complain). He had to exchange them in turn, and that meant
storing them till he could ﬁnd someone who wanted them. Building a
warehouse cost him his entire annual investment budget; if it could have
held its value, money would have been much cheaper to store.
Sometimes the arrangements required to make barter work were even
more complex. The woman receiving animal hides had set aside a por-
tion of her ﬁrm’s annual investment budget to set up a plant making
sausage skins. Why? The supplier of hides was getting restive, for good

Money and Human Relationships • 93
hides could be sold for American dollars abroad, and he was wondering
whether to stop supplying them to Russian buyers. But the supplier had
his own problem, which was that he also produced meat, and to dispose
of the meat he needed good-quality sausage skins. So the woman had an
idea, which was to make her company indispensable to him by producing
the elusive skins. That way she had a hostage she could use to secure the
supply of his hides. She and her colleagues might know nothing about
making sausage skins, but these were extraordinary times.
Her case was not at all unusual, except in being observed by a vis-
iting British economist. At a shoe factory I visited three years later in
Tashkent in Central Asia, even more complex deals were in the making.
The ﬁnance director had tried in vain to persuade his suppliers to take
shoes in payment, so now he was setting up as a supplier of general con-
sumer goods. His senior management colleagues spent their time scour-
ing local markets and telephoning their friends in other ﬁrms. Tomato
paste, porcelain, and pasta were particularly prized, for they could be
used to pay not only suppliers but the workforce as well.
I visited a plastics factory and tried to talk to the director about his
restructuring plans, but he had other things on his mind. “We’ve found
a reliable source of potatoes,” he told me, with evident pleasure. “The
workforce will be very glad; the arrears in their wages had been building
up. There’s not much else to pay them with. Though to tell the truth, we
tend to turn a bit of a blind eye these days to pilfering from the company
stores.”
In Kiev in 1995 I met an energetic young man who had set up a dairy-
processing plant on the land beside a coal-ﬁred power station. The collec-
tive farms in the region were all hopelessly in arrears for their electricity,
and besides useless Ukrainian currency all they had to oﬀer in exchange
was milk. The power station was not interested in milk payment, unless
some means could be found to process and market it—which was where
the entrepreneur came in. It didn’t sound very ecological, and it would
doubtless be redundant in a few years’ time, but in the meantime it was
working so well that plans were afoot to build a pasta factory and a
brewery on the same site.
In the years that followed the collapse of communism, it was often
fashionable to claim that more than seven decades of communism
had completely atrophied the Russian people’s entrepreneurial spirit.
Nobody seeing the ingenuity devoted to these complex barter deals could
have believed this facile insult for a moment. But like the creativity
with which ordinary Russians evaded taxes, navigated among gangsters,

94 • Chapter 6
found their way around shortages, and cared for their families when
health and education services were collapsing, this ingenuity made one
wonder what Russian society could achieve if it were harnessed to a more
fruitful and less mutually destructive end. Money is one of the great
human inventions precisely because it helps to narrow the gulf between
the ingenuity of each individual and the interest of others; it helps our
inventiveness to serve purposes other than mutual theft. Not the least
of its beneﬁts is that it frees shoe manufacturers to do what they are
good at (making shoes), instead of obliging them to become porcelain
merchants, sausage-skin manufacturers, or stockists of potatoes simply
in order to keep their shoemaking business aﬂoat.
We shall probably never know when the ﬁrst forms of money came
into existence. Coins have been dated to 600 b.c.e., and clay tablets from
Mesopotamia, used to record debts of grain and to transfer them from
one bearer to another, may be twice as old.2 But as James Buchan points
out in his book Frozen Desire: An Enquiry into the Meaning of Money,
“money may be older than writing but we will never know: an archaeolo-
gist may think an object he ﬁnds is old money, but he cannot know it is
without an inscription to tell him so.”3 Modern monetary theorists have
devoted enormous attention to understanding what makes it possible
for something to function eﬀectively as money—but, as we shall see, the
process by which historical economies came to depend upon money is
much more mysterious. Understanding how the web of monetary trust
was spun in the past is not the same as understanding what holds it in
place in the present.
The Web of Monetary Trust
What we do know is that once money has acquired certain character-
istics, its use becomes self-enforcing: people are willing to accept it in
exchange for their goods because they genuinely prefer to do so, and
not because the law says they must. This self-enforcing character is what
enables money to be the kind of institution that makes trust in strangers
possible: we accept it in exchange for valuable goods in spite of the fact
that we may know nothing about the individuals who are oﬀering it to
us.
What are the characteristics that make the use of money self-enforc-
ing? Any form of payment people accept for their own goods and services
with the intention of later trading it for other goods and services we can
call a medium of exchange. In principle a society can try to enforce legal

Money and Human Relationships • 95
tender for any medium of exchange (shopkeepers can be ﬁned if they
refuse to accept it), but in practice legal tender is enforceable only when
the medium has considerable acceptability in its own right. For a medium
of exchange to be attractive it has to have a number of characteristics:
• It has to be reasonably easy to store and to transport. Water is a
poor medium of exchange even in the desert, where it has consid-
erable value.
• It has to be sure not to lose its value before it is resold—through
decay or through theft. Bread is too perishable. Clothing, even valu-
able clothing, is too easy to steal.
• It must be possible for people without specialist expertise to tell
the diﬀerence between good quality and bad.4 Diamonds, though
highly valued, fantastically durable, and easy to hide from thieves,
have rarely been used as a medium of exchange because too much
expertise is required to tell the diﬀerence between gemstones and
fakes. The only circumstances in which diamonds have functioned
temporarily as a medium of exchange is in transactions between
experts and during civil wars in diamond-producing countries,
where, paradoxically, it may be harder to get hold of convincing
fakes than the real thing.
• It must be scarce, either naturally (like gold) or artiﬁcially through
the restricted printing of banknotes that are diﬃcult to forge. If
it were not, there would be easier ways to obtain money than by
oﬀering valuable goods in exchange. If acorns functioned as money,
for instance, people would stop producing other goods and start
collecting acorns instead.
• It has to be more widely acceptable by other people than the goods
in exchange for which it is oﬀered. If it were not, then there would
be no point in accepting the money; the seller could just hold stocks
of her own products until the time came to exchange them.
So the acceptability of money rests in part upon what people believe
about its probable acceptability in the future. There are some factors that
make acceptability more likely, such as anonymity, which ensures that
potentially interested trading partners will not be arbitrarily excluded
from using it. It seems obvious today that money is anonymous; this is
what gives it a quality at once clean and a little sinister, like a room so
exaggeratedly scrubbed as to make one wonder what might have hap-
pened there just before it was cleaned. But historically some kinds of

96 • Chapter 6
money have been restricted to transactions in certain classes of society,
like the shell currencies of the Solomon Islands, which until the late nine-
teenth century (as the anthropologist Denis Monnerie reports) had sepa-
rate denominations for use by chiefs and commoners.5 This had the inci-
dental consequence that a commoner who had sexual intercourse with
the wife of a chief could incur the death penalty. This was not because
it was a capital oﬀense: it was, on the contrary, considered an oﬀense
against property, and like most oﬀenses against property attracted only
a ﬁne. However, the ﬁne could only be paid in the currency of the aris-
tocracy, so the oﬀending commoner would be executed for nonpayment
of the ﬁne rather than for the original oﬀense.6
Not surprisingly, these shell currencies were soon driven out by com-
petition from the currencies brought by foreign traders (most obviously
by the U.S. dollar), once such traders arrived in signiﬁcant numbers in
the late nineteenth century. Why accept shell currencies that not every-
one else will accept when there is a universal and anonymous alternative
readily available? And the story of the shell currencies was very nearly
imitated in the 1990s by the Russian rouble.
Many billions of American dollars circulated inside Russia after the
collapse of communism, although nobody knew exactly how many since
their owners were understandably reticent about revealing their hold-
ings; the uncertainty continues today. This foreign currency cost the
Russian economy dearly: it represented many billions of dollars’ worth
of American goods that could have been bought and shipped to Russia
at a time when many of its people were suﬀering extreme poverty. It
would have been much better if the Russian authorities had been able to
persuade people to hold roubles instead of these dollars, for the cost of
roubles to the country as a whole is only the cost of printing them. But
the loss of conﬁdence in a currency is cumulative; once some people are
reluctant to hold it, others will become reluctant as well. And the very
attractiveness of roubles to the authorities—the fact that they cost so
much less to produce than they are worth in exchange—is exactly why
conﬁdence may be lost in the ﬁrst place. For much of the early 1990s rou-
bles were like acorns. The ease with which the authorities could make
them made it irresistible simply to print more roubles to pay for the
government’s spending on everything from the army to old-age pen-
sions, instead of doing hard work to persuade citizens to pay their taxes
in full and on time. But if roubles are just printed on demand, their
scarcity value—the very quality that makes them valuable as money—
will be inevitably undermined.

Money and Human Relationships • 97
As it happens, the Russian authorities were able to restore the scarcity
value of roubles by the mid 1990s, since the rate of price inﬂation (and
therefore the decline in the value of roubles over time) fell to very modest
levels by around 1995. But the incidence of barter went on rising for at
least another three years. What was wrong now was not the ease of mak-
ing money but the ease of transferring it—the very anonymity that makes
money in most circumstances such a useful component of modern life.
For during the wrenching conditions after the fall of communism, many
Russian ﬁrms had run up extremely large debts, and large debts create
long queues of creditors. If you lend money to a ﬁrm which owes money
to many other people, the chances are high that your loan will not be
used to do anything productive or new, but instead will be used merely
to pay oﬀcreditors further up the queue. In fact, the creditors further up
the queue have a legal right to insist on it, and if these creditors include
the tax authorities, they even have a legal right to impound the money
from the ﬁrm’s bank account. In these conditions it is hardly surprising
that lenders will lose all willingness to provide ﬁnance for business. And
without ﬁnance it is impossible for Russian business to begin the task
of adapting its products and processes to the modern world.
In an economy based on money, then, the queue is long, and the cred-
itors are stern. If the queue becomes too long, barter may provide a way
to jump it.7 If I deliver goods to you in exchange for a promise to pay me
back in money, then the money you have earmarked to pay me may be
seized by any one of your creditors, and the law will uphold their right
to do so. But if you have promised to pay me back in goods, then I count
as one of your customers, not one of your creditors. Your other creditors
are less likely to want to seize your goods anyway, and even if they do,
they cannot invoke the law to help them, so my chances of being repaid
are much higher.
Systematic queue-jumping was obviously at best a quick ﬁx, not a per-
manent answer to the problems of Russia’s chronically overindebted
ﬁrms. Not least of its costs is that everyone ends up settling for sec-
ond best. You may not want the shoes your trading partner oﬀers you:
they may not be the quality or the style you would have chosen, but
you accept them because it is better than not being paid at all. Even the
government was doing it: a ﬁrm manufacturing buses claimed the only
way it could pay its local taxes was to deliver buses to the local author-
ity instead of cash. The buses didn’t work very well; indeed, they broke
down rather often, leaving passengers stranded in the snow. But the local

98 • Chapter 6
tax oﬃce was not concerned, so long as it could place a tick against the
bus company in its records.
Russia’s ﬁrms found things much easier after the late 1990s, thanks
largely to higher prices for Russia’s exports (especially oil) that enabled
more of the creditors in the queue to be paid oﬀthan anyone realistically
imagined. Barter declined to insigniﬁcant levels as a result—fortunately,
for those who have tried barter know how much it hurts. But one eﬀect
of the ﬁnancial crisis on the Russian economy was that by 2009 there
were signs of barter emerging again.8 This is unlikely to last long but it
may inﬂict considerable damage on the Russian economy while it does.
How Did Money Become Established?
Given the characteristics that make certain kinds of money self-enforcing
(and without which it loses its attractiveness, as it did for a while in post-
communist Russia), it’s tempting to think that societies learned histor-
ically to use money through a gradual “bottom-up” process by which
individual initiative gradually converged on the use of particular com-
modities as media of exchange, which were then eventually replaced by
the state currencies that are the forms of money we know today. And
we know of at least one historical episode that ﬁts this characterization
perfectly—so well, indeed, that economists have taken it to be typical
of the process as it occurred elsewhere in history and even in prehis-
tory. But other evidence suggests that this episode may in fact have been
extremely unusual.9
The episode in question took place in a German prisoner of war camp.
It has come to be so well-known because among the prisoners was an
economist called R. A. Radford, who went on to publish an article about
his experiences in the journal Economica a few months after his liber-
ation in 1945.10 The currency that emerged was cigarettes, which were
“homogeneous, reasonably durable, and of convenient size for the small-
est or, in packets, for the largest transactions.” Radford noted the way
in which all other commodities (cheese, jam, chocolate, and so forth)
would have prices quoted in cigarettes. He described episodes of price
inﬂation (following unexpected deliveries of Red Cross parcels contain-
ing cigarettes) and deﬂation (when allied bombing raids disrupted such
deliveries). He also showed how cigarettes displayed many other char-
acteristics of money, including Gresham’s Law, which states that lower-
quality currencies drive out higher-quality ones: high-quality brands of

Money and Human Relationships • 99
cigarettes were rarely used as currency because people preferred to keep
them to smoke.
Similar episodes have been documented elsewhere. U.S. soldiers in Iraq
have also used cigarettes as currency.11 However, recent developments
make cigarettes less than ideal in some settings. Since 2004 smoking
has been outlawed in U.S. federal prisons, and inmates are not allowed
to carry cash. So in many federal prisons the currency that has emerged
is cans or pouches of mackerel ﬁllets. What makes this currency popular,
as the Wall Street Journal reports, is that “each can (or pouch) costs about
$1 and few—other than weight-lifters craving protein—want to eat it”—a
striking conﬁrmation of Gresham’s Law.12
Episodes such as these have helped to convince many economists that
the historical development of money followed a process in which, in the
words of Paul Samuelson, “the age of commodity money gives way to
the age of paper money…Finally, along with the age of paper money,
there is the age of bank money, or bank checking deposits.”13 The idea
behind this is that a spontaneous convergence on commodities as media
of exchange led governments eventually to create currencies (ﬁrst in
coin and then in paper) that fulﬁlled these functions more eﬃciently.
The development of bank deposits as a form of currency (the exchange
of debts of the banking system as means of payment instead of either
commodity or paper money) then had to wait for the development of a
sophisticated banking system.
Reasonable as this conjecture sounds, the evidence doesn’t support it.
Evidence of transferable debt tokens from Mesopotamia is twice as old
as the oldest coins that have yet been found. Evidently, when one per-
son with a debt to a grain merchant wanted to pay another person with
a similar debt, the ﬁrst would pay oﬀthe debt of the second—just like
a modern checking system, in fact, but not at all like a cash economy.
We don’t know whether some commodities also functioned as means of
exchange, or whether people just kept tallies of their debts to the lead-
ing merchants. But the emergence of money in prison camps and during
modern wars tells us nothing about this and may be historically quite
misleading; it happens among people who have been used to sophisti-
cated currencies and are temporarily prevented by circumstances from
using them.
It seems likely, in fact, that what led historically to the emergence of
cash economies in various parts of the world was not the issue by the
political authorities of forms of money with the “right” characteristics to
make them generally acceptable media of exchange. Debt tokens issued

100 • Chapter 6
by various creditors including private banks were probably in circula-
tion in many places where coins did not exist, and many of the great
fairs of medieval Europe cleared debts among the merchants “without
the use of single coin.”14 These debt tokens typically competed with one
another—and with state currencies where these existed. Indeed, as late
as 1859 there were nearly ten thousand diﬀerent kinds of banknotes
circulating in the United States as well as over ﬁve thousand diﬀerent
counterfeit banknotes,15 indicating that even so sophisticated an econ-
omy as the United States was having real diﬃculty coordinating on a
form of currency that everyone could use. Instead, what brought about
convergence on a common currency was the requirement that taxes be
paid in the form of money in question. People would then choose to
use the money because they needed it to pay their taxes to the political
authority. That, rather than any emerging spontaneous consensus, was
the foundation of the social equilibrium that established money—and in
many parts of the world it did not happen until quite recently.
When it did happen, the political authorities would often demand tax
payments in a currency which was designed to have the right character-
istics for use as a medium of exchange. But sometimes political realism
trumped monetary principles, as William Henry Furness reported when
describing the establishment of a tax regime by the German colonial
authorities in Uap (part of the Caroline Islands) in 1898. Despairing of
ever enforcing their insistence that the islanders repair the local roads,
and unable to induce them to work for pay in any known currency, the
authorities made use of the fact that fei—large stone wheels—were used
by the islanders in ceremonial exchange:
[They] marked a certain number of the most valuable fei with a cross in
black paint to show that the stones were claimed by the Government.
This instantly worked like a charm; the people, thus dolefully impov-
erished, turned to and repaired the highway to such good eﬀect from
one end of the island to the other, that they are now like park drives.
Then the Government dispatched its agents and erased the crosses.16
Stone wheels are about as unsuitable a currency as anyone could imagine
for use as a general medium of exchange, but in the circumstances they
were the best available taxable currency. The characteristics that make
money a stable basis for social exchange may not have been enough,
therefore, to establish money historically as an eﬀective medium of
exchange. Quite a lot of coercion may have been needed and, as in the
Caroline Islands, the result may not always have been good news for the
citizens.

Money and Human Relationships • 101
None of this means that political authorities have historically been
able just to decide in what form they insisted on the payment of taxes.
It would be a mistake, for instance, to think that the Russian economy’s
ﬂight to barter in the 1990s happened because the government did not
always insist on payment of taxes in roubles but was prepared to take
buses instead. On the contrary, given the depreciation of the rouble and
the unreliability of rouble bank accounts because of their vulnerability to
seizure, it’s likely that tax authorities who accepted payments in kind did
so because of the impossibility of their ever being paid otherwise. What
that episode shows, though, is that however the institution of money
has come to be established, it plays a vital role in the functioning of a
modern economy based on sophisticated networks of exchange. Money
may not have been established historically as a more eﬃcient alternative
to barter, but given how complex are the networks of a modern economy,
barter has become a lot less eﬃcient than money. But money is fragile,
and if trust in money is undermined, the consequences can be dire.
Money, Anonymity, and Unease
At the same time that Russia’s citizens have been feeling the pain
of barter, the attraction of barter has been growing in some parts of
the industrialized West. The International Reciprocal Trade Association
(www.irta.com) is an enthusiastic ambassador for the beneﬁts of barter
trade in the modern world. It claims (though this is impossible to verify)
that over 400,000 companies worldwide earned some ten billion dollars
through barter transactions in 2008—though even this amounts to only
$25,000 per company. It points to the role of computers and the inter-
net in matching the demands of diﬀerent customers and achieving the
“double coincidence of wants” that has been such a challenge for barter
transactions in the past—the enormous eﬀort that has to be put by sup-
pliers of one good into ﬁnding buyers who not only want the good in
question but have a desirable good to oﬀer in return.
Small-scale barter networks (often known as local exchange trading
systems, or LETS17) have also been growing in a number of towns. They
allow individuals to trade goods and services on a small scale and to build
up credit in points or some other artiﬁcial currency for exchange against
other goods and services at a later date. Their attractiveness may depend
to some extent on the greater ease with which their transactions escape
taxation and to some extent on a yearning to decouple one’s community
from the monetary economy, but for whatever reason their popularity is

102 • Chapter 6
unquestionably on the rise. Similar alternative currencies have been set
up in Venezuela with the blessing of President Chavez, apparently in a
bid to ﬁnd alternatives to the institutions of capitalism.18
Many claims are made for barter by its enthusiasts: that it is more
eﬃcient, that it is more fun, even that it is more ethical. Many people
have felt that there is something a little sinister about the ubiquity and
anonymity of monetary transactions in the modern world. “Money has no
smell,” said the emperor Vespasian, and it is precisely this that makes
some people shudder (Vespasian was referring, somewhat smugly, to
the fact that he had succeeded in imposing a tax on public lavatories).
A lyrical, even purple, expression of this point of view appears in the
closing paragraph of James Buchan’s book Frozen Desire, in which he
holds out the dream of a world free of money:
One day, who knows, the human race might stir. My heroes and heroines
wake from their sleep and rub their eyes. Honour pushes credit away
with an indescribable grimace of disgust, charity runs shrieking from
the Charity Ball and virtue and solvency discuss a separation, which
becomes permanent. Liberty puts down her shopping bag and rests her
bunioned feet. The Owl of Minerva opens one eye, then the other, and
extends her tattered wings for ﬂight. And as these dreams dissolve, the
Age of Money, which came after the Age of Faith, will itself draw, as all
things under the sun, to an end.19
But whatever else may be claimed for it, barter is never an eﬃcient sys-
tem for society as a whole, though taxes and other regulations, or the
absence of trustworthy money, may make it an understandable refuge
for many individuals. Even with sophisticated computer- and internet-
based systems for bringing about a double coincidence of wants, barter
will always run up against a fundamental problem: when searching for
someone who wants to buy what I have to sell, how can I be sure that
what he has to oﬀer in return is of the quality I require? The attraction of
money is precisely that I can be more conﬁdent of its quality than I can of
almost anything else a buyer can oﬀer. Barter will always survive where
participants have already overcome the problem of trust in other ways:
in small communities where people know each other well, and even on a
larger scale where the goods exchanged are suﬃciently standardized for
their quality to be quickly veriﬁable without much eﬀort. But as a means
of mediating the exchange of inscrutables between strangers, on which
more and more of modern life is based, no realistic alternative to money
has ever yet been found.

Money and Human Relationships • 103
What about the ethical appeal of barter? What is the foundation for
this widespread unease about the Age of Money? It doubtless has many
roots, and it would take another book than this to explore them all. Dis-
dain for money is sometimes just a shorthand way of expressing disdain
for wealth (money is, after all, a shorthand for all the many things it can
be used to acquire). More subtly, disdain for money has often been a
coded expression of the insecurity of aristocrats and those who lived
on inherited wealth in the face of wealth acquired through economic
activity and—especially—trade. This insecurity may have had important
social and economic consequences, through the way it shaped attitudes
toward economic activity in many societies, from ancient Athens to mod-
ern Britain. The historian Martin Wiener has argued that the “decline of
the industrial spirit” in Britain was due to exactly such unresolved inse-
curities among the dominant ﬁgures in British culture, from the landed
aristocracy of the nineteenth century to the literary and artistic inﬂu-
ences on so important a ﬁgure as John Maynard Keynes.20 More compli-
catedly still, disdain for money has often played on a deliberate ambigu-
ity between “money” in the sense of wealth and “money” in the sense of
an anonymous medium of exchange whose very anonymity and super-
ﬁciality makes it somehow suspect. As a rhetorical device it becomes a
term of disparagement by a hinted association that would rarely stand
up to examination if it were presented as an explicit argument. Many
writers who bemoan the spread of the market in the modern world
have expressed their complaint in terms of the inﬂuence of a money
mentality,21 a complaint that might be less rhetorically persuasive if it
were directed simply at the division of labor and the spread of social
exchange.
Even a cursory glance at the place of money in poetry and prose liter-
ature reveals how closely this unease is tied up with ambivalence about
the human body, and particularly with the ambiguities of our sexual-
ity. This does not mean that the ambiguities of our sexuality cause us
to feel this way about money, but it is likely that we use terms that
convey our unease about sexuality in order to express the unease we
feel—perhaps for other reasons—about money and its pervasive social
inﬂuence. The word “luxury” used to mean “lechery” as recently as the
seventeenth century, and to this day the French for lechery is “la luxure.”
The Jacobean dramatist Cyril Tourneur has the duke in The Revenger’s
Tragedy described by an onlooker as “a parch’d and juiceless luxur.”22
The word “expense” (as in Shakespeare’s sonnet 129, which begins “the
expense of spirit in a waste of shame”) used to stand for orgasm, and

104 • Chapter 6
until the late nineteenth century the colloquial term for having an orgasm
was not “to come” but “to spend.” Perhaps this analogy is due to the
similarity between the tiredness that follows in the wake of sexual plea-
sure and the ﬁnancial depletion that succeeds the pleasure of spending
money (both kinds of exhaustion frequently occasioning, and perhaps
being confused with, feelings of guilt). Partly it may be due to the sense
that money as an accounting mechanism submits pleasures to an unfor-
giving scrutiny, like that of traditional morality. Most of all it has to do
with money’s anonymity, the sense that the trust it buys is somehow
fraudulently acquired, being based on impersonal rules rather than per-
sonal understanding. Sexuality is the area of human life most permeated
by the ideal of willing and autonomous exchange between partners moti-
vated by convergent desire, and yet it is also the one most poisoned by
the suspicion that the appearance of desire is but simulation, cloaking a
more indirect and mercenary motive. The indirect masquerading as the
direct is likewise at money’s very heart.
Money tantalizes us by the disparity between what it looks like on
the surface and what it hints at underneath. As James Buchan puts
it: “Money, to use an old-fashioned mechanical metaphor, has become
a sort of railway shunting-yard which is for ever receiving the wishes
and dreams of countless people and despatching them to unimagined
destinations.”23 This sense of limitless possibility also undermines the
comfort of familiar categories, leading to an impression that people with
money can buy their way out of conﬁnement by the social and moral
judgments that constrain the rest of us. Balzac puts this complaint in
the mouth of Esther, the rather innocent heroine of his novel Splendors
and Miseries of the Courtesans:
A girl with no income ﬁnds herself in the mud, as I was before I entered
the convent. Men ﬁnd her beautiful, they make her serve their pleasure
without according her the smallest respect, they come for her in a car-
riage and then send her away on foot. If they never quite spit in her face,
it is only her beauty that spares her this outrage. But let her inherit ﬁve
or six million, and she will be sought out by princes, saluted as she
passes in her carriage; she can choose from the most ancient coats of
arms of France and Navarre. This world, which would have sneered at
us [her and her impoverished lover] for being two handsome creatures,
united and content, has constantly honoured Madame de Staël with her
bohemian life, because she had an income of two hundred thousand
livres. The world, which bows before Money and Glory, has no wish to
honor happiness or virtue.24

Money and Human Relationships • 105
A later writer, Martin Amis, uses the same device in a back-to-front
way by making his narrator play with the idea of money as protection:
“Money,” he writes, “I must put money round me, more money, soon.
I must be safe.”25 The deceptive promise of safety has become one of
the most enduring themes in our contemporary attitude toward money,
and one that has become more insistent the safer money has histori-
cally become. It is an intriguing feature of modern life that as sexual
morality has increasingly been privatized, the ethics of ﬁnancial probity
have become the growing object of collective regulation. This is both
inevitable and desirable, but that does not stop it from feeling strange.
Even the AIDS crisis has not reversed the growing belief that in pros-
perous societies ﬁnancial behavior has more seamless links to the fate
of the rest of society than does sexual behavior. Sex may be the subject
of endless curiosity but in the end creates smaller ripples in the pond
(though the tragic exception of Africa, now ravaged by AIDS, reminds us
that in the very poorest societies the reverse may now be true).
The fact that money is safer now in most prosperous societies than
it has ever been makes its remaining hazards all the more troubling.
It symbolizes the way in which we are connected to strangers as never
before. Our response to these connections, and our attempts through
political institutions to reassert control over the ﬁnancial structure of
our economies, have led to ediﬁces of regulation as striking in their com-
plexity as the ﬁnancial institutions they seek to dominate. These are the
subject of chapter 7.

Honor among Thieves: Hoarding and Stealing
Storage, Lending, and Panic
A wide range of animals hoard food outside their own bodies, from the
Sphex wasp (which paralyzes insects for its own larvae to feed on) to
dogs, bees, and squirrels. It is something that becomes harder to do the
larger and more sophisticated the animal. Big animals are big eaters and
big excreters, often too much so for their immediate environment to
support them for long, so they are obliged periodically to move on. But
the gypsy life limits how much you can store, for it must all be carried
with you.
When our ancestors ﬁrst began to settle down to a farming lifestyle
some ten thousand years ago, the burden of carrying stores of food was
soon replaced by the burden of protecting them. How many times must
a family have stared in dismay at the cracked clay vessel, the scattered
stones, the trail of grain marking theft by rats or men and whispering
the prospect of starvation, before it occurred to them that sometimes
the best protection is not the closest to home?
The division of labor long ago proved its value for the hoarding of
food as well as for its production. Indeed, one of the best ways to hoard
the food you have produced is to sell it, to a merchant whose solid ware-
houses give him an advantage in protecting his stores while the coins or
banknotes he gives you in return are more suitable for the limited pro-
tection you can provide. But even before money was invented, families
probably deposited their stocks of grain at the sturdier houses of others
whom they believed they could trust. Later they would do the same with
money too. The ﬁrst banks were no more than places of safekeeping.
Borrowing and lending are as old as communal living, as deeply embed-
ded in social life as the sharing of meat from a kill. But banks are a
remarkable and much more recent innovation; no records can tell us
when they ﬁrst began, but a plausible guess is that it was after the inven-
tion of agriculture and well before, not after, the invention of coinage,

Honor among Thieves: Hoarding and Stealing • 107
as we saw in chapter 6. They may have begun simply as storehouses
(certainly that was true of the ﬁrst recorded banks).1 Their subsequent
transformation into proper banks may even have been the fruit of deceit,
the ingenuity of a warehouse owner who realized that he could lend out
some of the grain he was storing on others’ behalf without the knowledge
of its owners.2 If he was a prosperous enough farmer in his own right, he
might hope to keep secret for a while the fact that not all the grain he lent
out was his own, but in small communities the secret would soon be out.
In towns of some size, the operation might keep going for longer: what
was needed was enough owners of grain, with diverse enough require-
ments, for the ﬂedgling banker to feel conﬁdent he could always meet
the demands of any one owner who came to reclaim his stock, by drawing
on the unclaimed stock of others.
It must still have been diﬃcult, winning the trust of suspicious peas-
ants who wanted to know why the grain they reclaimed came from other
vessels than those in which they had ﬁrst seen it stored, and who must
have wondered whether it was of quality as good as their own. The grad-
ual arrival of money must have made that task easier, since its obvious
anonymity makes irrelevant the question “But is it really mine?” To the
peasant too poor to aﬀord secure storage, the arrival of money meant
that grain could be sold instead of lent, while money could be hoarded
at home, deposited for safekeeping elsewhere, or lent out explicitly for
use by others.
But lending money is risky in its own way. Its anonymity and the ease
with which it can be concealed make fraud all the more tempting. So
banks have not completely displaced that old standby of peasant soci-
eties, the storeroom in a corner of your house. Over a billion peasants
around the world still store food at the end of the harvest for as long
as the supply holds out. Even those who sell the produce often feel the
money is less safe in a bank than under the mattress. In rich industrial
societies it is safer in the bank—most of the time. For banks have ﬂour-
ished because of their ingenious capacities for helping people to live with
risk. Like many of the human institutions that do so, they have reduced
everyday risks to levels low enough to make us forget that risk exists at
all, sometimes leaving us startlingly unprepared for the more unusual
hazards, whose impact can be very large.
If you want to hoard what you value—food, money, objects of beauty—
but don’t trust the safety of your own home, you have to ﬁnd someone
who not only is capable of storing it for you but can also be relied upon
to return it to you afterward. The storage is a service performed on your

108 • Chapter 7
behalf. It will therefore usually cost you something (a portion of the value
preserved), unless your valuables can be made to perform a service of
their own in the meantime. So instead of asking your neighbor to store
grain for you, you could try asking him to plant it. By planting it he will
reap a harvest that may substantially exceed what he needs to return
your grain to you at the end of the season. Now you are doing him a
service, and one for which he should be prepared to pay you. Your hoard
of grain is no longer idle, but it is not instantly accessible. In order to
allow it to perform a useful service you have had to forgo the right to
call it back whenever you want it. And in the meantime it is exposed to
all the usual hazards of the harvest.
The ingenuity of banks rests on their using the law of large numbers
to create the illusion that anyone’s hoard is accessible even while most
people’s hoards are being made to perform a useful service. It is an illu-
sion, though no more dishonest than the illusion that anyone may visit
the U.S. Senate or the Houses of Parliament even though it would clearly
be impossible for everyone to do so at the same time. Or the illusion
that I can go to the bus-stop without a reservation and expect to ﬁnd
a space on the bus. Or the illusion that I can always make a telephone
call without a prior appointment, or switch on the kettle to make myself
coﬀee without overloading the capacity of the electricity grid. Or the
thousands of other daily illusions that keep modern societies in motion.
There are frequent rents in the fabric of such illusions: sometimes the
bus is completely full; a commercial break in the television coverage of
a British royal wedding has been known to cause chaos on the electric
grid as millions of kettles switch on within seconds; and simultaneous
toilet use during the breaks in the Super Bowl imposes heavy strain on
the drains. And once in a while there is a run on a bank.
Bank runs are dangerous, and not just because people’s life savings
may be involved. Some broken illusions lead to a stabilizing reaction: if
the bus is full, I wait for the next one; if the telephone network is busy, I
make my call later. But if I hear a rumor that there is a run on my bank,
do I stay home until the panic has subsided? Not if I know what is good
for me. When a bank run is threatened, the only sensible thing to do is to
run faster than the others, and that in turn means that it may take only
an unsubstantiated rumor for a bank’s customers to run to it in panic.
In a matter of days or even hours, the illusion that their savings are all
simultaneously accessible can unravel.3
This vulnerability of banks to panic runs is what makes the ﬁnan-
cial system a peculiarly fragile part of the network of institutions that

Honor among Thieves: Hoarding and Stealing • 109
make up modern social life. A panic run can damage a healthy and well-
managed bank no less than an incompetent or corrupt one, for even
a healthy bank will have used its deposits to make loans that cannot
all be instantly called back (indeed, if banks did not make such loans,
investments could never be undertaken by people who have ideas but not
enough funds to back them). So the fate of diﬀerent banks may be linked,
and the risks of banking may propagate themselves across a whole soci-
ety with alarming speed. In some ways the dangers are harder to avoid
than many of the other risks that people transmit to each other. Viruses
(physical or informational) can be transmitted rapidly across the world,
but once people realize the dangers, they adjust their behavior to com-
pensate: they are more scrupulous about practicing safe sex, for exam-
ple, more cautious about opening email attachments. With bank runs, by
contrast, the greater the danger, the more people’s behavior multiplies
it as everyone tries to avoid being the last in line.
In most industrial societies, governments have responded to these
dangers by setting up systems of deposit insurance, in which all deposi-
tors are subject to a small tax in order to pay compensation to those who
lose their savings through incompetence or fraud. Even if many panics
have been avoided, crashes have still happened, as we shall see in chap-
ter 8. For if too much nervousness can unravel the delicate system of
illusion on which the banking system depends, too little nervousness
can lead to lethargy and gullibility, thus issuing an open invitation to
fantasists and charlatans. Most days my incoming email contains mes-
sages urging me to make a fortune for almost no eﬀort by sending money
to an address somewhere in cyberspace. It is a safe bet that the few such
invitations that are not downright dishonest are wholly unrealistic, rely-
ing on the chain letter principle to make money for early participants at
the expense of later ones. If I were insured against loss every time I sent
oﬀmoney in response to an email solicitation, I would have no need to
be careful, and the number of people trying to make money out of others
in this simple way would explode. Why do any productive work if you
can make money from people who will be bailed out by the government
for every penny they send to you?
So when governments oﬀer deposit insurance they do so at a price:
only institutions that hold a deposit-taking license may qualify, and as
quid pro quo they must subject themselves to detailed and intrusive
supervision. For if depositors no longer have an incentive to monitor
the activities of banks, the government must do so, on behalf of the
taxpayers whose money is now at risk. As recent events have reminded

110 • Chapter 7

Honor among Thieves: Hoarding and Stealing • 111
us, supervision is not infallible; both incompetence and fraud can and do
slip through the net. Even if runs occur much more rarely than they once
did, they were not unknown even before the crisis of 2007. In January
1991 the newly elected governor of Rhode Island closed forty-ﬁve of the
state’s banks within three hours of taking oﬃce, thereby freezing the
accounts of some three hundred thousand people. He did this because
their deposits had been insured by a private insurer that became insol-
vent, and there were signs of an incipient bank run. The next day the
announcement of losses at the Bank of New England led in turn to a
run on that bank and its subsequent seizure by the government. With-
out the atmosphere of panic caused by the Rhode Island action, there
would probably not have been a run on the Bank of New England. With-
out the insolvency of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity
Corporation, there would have been no closure of Rhode Island banks.
And without losses the previous November by Heritage Loan and Invest-
ment, a tiny, two-branch bank in Providence, Rhode Island, there would
have been no insolvency on the part of the insurer. The president of that
bank, one Joseph Mollicone, was subsequently convicted on ﬁve counts
of embezzlement, nineteen counts of false bank entries, and two counts
of conspiracy and was given a long prison sentence.4
If the failure of a two-branch bank can cause a widespread run, how
much more threatening is the failure of a large bank? Among the main
depositors with banks are other banks, and in any case deposit insurance
is usually less than perfect, and the contagion of panic undiscriminating,
so other banks may suﬀer by association even when they have no direct
links with the failing bank. Deposit insurance and supervision are not
enough, therefore, to prevent either bank failure or the threat of a run
on an otherwise healthy bank. Instead, the authorities ﬁnd themselves
from time to time playing the role of “lender of last resort.” The author-
ities stand ready to do what the markets by themselves will not: they
allow banks to borrow, usually on easy terms, to cover the costs of their
exposure to the bank that has failed. In return they usually insist on
Figure 7.1. President Andrew Jackson (1767–1845) refuses in 1832 to renew
the charter of the Bank of the United States on the grounds that it is a tool
of the rich, choosing to remove all government funds from the bank and to
deposit them in state banks around the country. Pandemonium ensues amid

the closure of the failing bank. Its managers are rarely punished, except
in the most egregious cases of fraud, but most of them lose their jobs
and fritter away their golden parachutes in a retirement of complaint
at their unreliable customers and overzealous regulators. Their fate is
hardly one to strike terror into the heart of their surviving colleagues in
other banks, but the authorities in most industrialized societies think the
damage done by complacent bankers who lend too easily is less severe
than the damage unwittingly done by bankers who are too nervous to
lend at all.
Most of the time the authorities are right, but once in a while the
sheer scale of incompetence and fraud can catch everyone by surprise.
After the great American banking crises of the 1930s, in which some
ten thousand banks failed, and which led to the creation of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), American banking enjoyed thirty-
ﬁve postwar years without runs or panics of any kind and with very few
bank failures at all. But at the beginning of the 1980s, looser regulation of
banks allowed them (and particularly the savings-and-loan institutions
specializing in mortgage ﬁnance) to oﬀer higher interest rates to deposi-
tors while investing speculatively in real estate. Bust followed boom in a
vertiginous cycle. There was a startling increase in bank failures, which
by 1988 were running at over two hundred a year. By 1991 the FDIC was
spectacularly insolvent, ending the year with a deﬁcit of $7 billion even
though it had received an injection of $30 billion from the U.S. Trea-
sury earlier in the year (as one U.S. senator put it, in a diﬀerent context,
“A billion here, a billion there, and soon you’re talking real money”).
The subsequent overhaul of ﬁnancial regulation led most policymakers
to think that the system was now reasonably protected against crises.
They could not have been more wrong.
Buying Trust
The banking system builds great Gothic structures of interdependent
transactions upon a slender foundation of trust, but there are more mod-
est ediﬁces all around us, for trust is the mortar for most of the encoun-
ters between strangers in a modern society. Even something as simple
as a trip to buy fruit at a street market involves the buyer in a careful
evaluation of the quality of the produce on oﬀer. In theory most legal
systems pay homage to the principle of “caveat emptor”—let the buyer
beware—meaning that it is the buyer’s responsibility to ensure she is not
cheated. There is sense in this, for buyers have the keenest interest in

Honor among Thieves: Hoarding and Stealing • 113
looking out for defective goods and are usually the best placed to spot
them. But in practice very few legal systems ever place complete respon-
sibility on the buyer. The fruit I buy may go rotten as soon as I take it
home, and I shall have nobody but myself to blame. But if it contains a
proscribed chemical, then the law may become involved.
The limits of the caveat emptor principle are usually drawn accord-
ing to an uneasy compromise between the wish to encourage care and
skepticism on the part of buyers and the fact that many of the greatest
dangers are too subtle and invisible for buyers to check. In most indus-
trialized countries, the law intervenes in everyday transactions in many
thousands of arenas: safety at work, the chemical content of food and
medicines, the technical speciﬁcation of electrical equipment, the terms
of ﬁnancial services, the training of teachers and doctors, the content
of advertisements, the emission of exhaust gases on cars, the takeovers
and mergers of ﬁrms. Not all of these interventions are justiﬁed by an
appeal to the protection of the buyer, but a large number of them are.
But the law is a clumsy and unreliable ally of the buyer, and its inter-
ventions are inevitably limited to correcting those breaches of trust that
are clear and precise enough to be established in front of a court, or at
least by a formalized administrative procedure. Many of the other famil-
iar institutions of social life can be seen as a way for buyers to seek
allies from among themselves, and even—strange paradox—for buyers
to seek allies from among sellers, the very people whose unreliabil-
ity such alliances seek to prevent. The explanation is that unreliability
harms many sellers too: everyone who has a good car to sell but cannot
persuade a buyer of its merits, good, fresh food to trade that cannot be
made to stand out from the mediocre produce on neighboring stalls, a
medicine that promises a real cure but looks too much like the reme-
dies of a thousand mountebanks. So: trade associations, money-back
guarantees, the Hippocratic oath, the appellation contrôlée, inspectors
of weights and measures, the convention that “my word is my bond,”
trademarks and brand names, the salesman’s uniform, the training cer-
tiﬁcate hanging on the oﬃce wall, the opulence of a professional waiting
room that soothes the visitor’s anxiety about how much it is all going to
cost with the subliminal assurance that nobody who makes this much
money can be peddling unsound advice—all of these are signals, more
or less subtle, that what the seller has to oﬀer is the best anyone could
reasonably expect. Sometimes the signals have to be subtle in order to
make them diﬃcult to fake: comparing television advertisements from
the 1950s with those made half a century later is intriguing because it

114 • Chapter 7
makes us realize how unpersuasive were direct boasts about the qual-
ity of a laundry detergent once viewers woke up to the fact that makers
of low-quality laundry detergent could make the very same boasts. So
the race to be persuasive has taken ever more baroque forms, much
as the peacock’s tail evolved toward an eﬄorescence further and fur-
ther removed from the original signal of health and strength to which
it must have owed its origin. Nowadays television advertisements are
increasingly a parade of dandyish preening and ironic self-reference, as
makers of even the most humble domestic products strive to project that
indeﬁnable quality (panache? ﬂair?) that makes us think we have found
the rare genuine article in a world of dross.
To put the matter slightly diﬀerently, the peasant virtues in all soci-
eties have included never taking anything on trust but always checking
for yourself the quality of what you are oﬀered. But checking for your-
self is impossible once you are involved in more than a few transactions
a day. So modern societies have resorted to a division of labor in the ver-
iﬁcation of authenticity, just as they have resorted to a division of labor
in almost everything else. The creation of brands—now a multibillion
dollar activity in its own right—represents an investment in trustwor-
thiness. It is both a signal to customers (our products must be good if
we can aﬀord to spend so much money telling you about them) and a
commitment mechanism that in fact keeps ﬁrms up to the mark (if we
let standards fall, we shall destroy the value of our brand).
Banks in particular have come a long way from their simple origins
as places of safekeeping. The best bank is no longer the place with the
most secure vault, since the money you entrust to your bank will not
simply be stored; it will be invested elsewhere. The best bank is now the
one with the shrewdest eye for sound investments. It is therefore the
most convincing purveyor of trust in the many claims made by would-
be borrowers for the quality of their business propositions.
Modern man buys his trust as he buys his food and his clothes and
his house. Sometimes the ultimate guarantor of his trust is the state, but
more often, in many thousands of everyday ways that are so familiar as
to be quite invisible unless we open our eyes to them, it is his fellow cit-
izens who are the guarantors—the very people whose trustworthiness
is in question. The idea of “honor among thieves,” though coined as a
paradox, is in fact one of transparent simplicity, for only in a world of
thieves is honor necessary. It is no accident that the strictest codes of
honor in any society are those that govern relations among its crimi-
nals, for honor is one of the most eﬀective ways to organize relations in

Honor among Thieves: Hoarding and Stealing • 115
the shadows where the law does not reach. But even in the daylight, the
law is at most a background presence. The honor, reputation, and trust-
worthiness of those with whom you deal—qualities in which they may
have invested mightily, but which you accept on possibly the slenderest
of objective evidence—are the foundation of your willingness even to
step outside your house in the morning. When the whole structure of a
modern society rests on such a foundation, it is not surprising that the
collapse of trust that can follow a banking scandal, a political upheaval,
or the exposure of corruption among trusted public ﬁgures can take on
the dimensions of a major social earthquake.

Honor among Bankers?
What Caused the Financial Crisis?
A Failure of Trust
The world ﬁnancial crisis that erupted in 2007 was a failure of social
trust on a massive scale. It is in some ways a test case for the arguments
developed in this book, for it is the very success of our most ambitious
institutions for promoting trust that gives them the power to do us such
serious damage. A boom in which too many people trusted others uncrit-
ically to be taking diﬃcult decisions about risk on their behalf has been
followed by a crash in which everyone’s ability to trust others with such
decisions is being reevaluated—in a mood of widespread pessimism that
has as little objective justiﬁcation as the undiscriminating optimism that
preceded it. As we’ll see, this kind of collective mood swing is one to
which the evolved psychology of Homo sapiens sapiens seems particu-
larly vulnerable.
The roots of the excessive optimism date back as far as the U.S. bank-
ing crisis that began in 1929, and the subsequent belief that we now knew
enough about its causes to prevent anything like it from ever happen-
ing again. That crisis was eﬀectively stopped in March 1933 by allowing
banks to borrow currency from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
and requiring them to pay out depositors’ claims in this currency instead
of in gold. At the same time the creation of the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation (FDIC) guaranteed the deposits of private borrowers, so
that few of them wanted to make precautionary withdrawals any more—
indeed many who had previously made withdrawals in gold returned the
gold to the banks. Although more than 5,000 banks had failed in the
three years 1930–32, in 1934 only nine banks failed. This fairly sudden
end to the banking crisis brought a sense of welcome relief to the public
and to policymakers alike. But it encouraged policymakers to draw three
signiﬁcant but mistaken lessons about the role of trust and conﬁdence
in a modern banking system.
The ﬁrst lesson they drew was that the main reason why banks had
failed in the period 1929–33 was that depositors had panicked, rather

Honor among Bankers? What Caused the Financial Crisis? • 117
than that the banks themselves were insolvent. The second false les-
son was that the depositors who were prone to panic would always be
small depositors—households and small ﬁrms—rather than corporations
or professional investors. The third false lesson was that if only conﬁ-
dence in the ﬁnancial system could be maintained, the system itself could
be trusted to survive and prosper. These three assumptions about the
causes of the 1929 Crash at ﬁrst seemed borne out by the long period
of ﬁnancial calm and prosperity that followed; they would be tested to
destruction in the crisis that brought that period to an end. The long
calm so completely blinded most historically informed observers to the
dangers that one reputable ﬁnancial economist was blogging as late as
January 2008 that “the U.S. banking system is probably stronger and
more stable today than at any time in U.S. history.”1 So what exactly was
wrong with the conclusions that had been drawn from the 1930s?
What the Banking System Does when It Is Working Well
To understand why the successful resolution of the banking crisis of
the 1930s should have blinded policymakers to the crisis of the early
twenty-ﬁrst century, it’s important to look again at what banking does.
In a world of ever-present risk, banks create small but vital islands of
safety. The world around me may be in constant ﬂux, and the outlook
for the various economic projects and adventures undertaken by me and
by those I know may be very uncertain, but most of the time there are
some questions that thankfully I just don’t need to ask. When you write
me a check on your bank for ﬁfty dollars I know it will be worth the same
as a check for ﬁfty dollars written on someone else’s bank. I also know
that every ﬁfty dollars I have on deposit in one bank will—in normal
times—be worth the same as ﬁfty dollars in another bank. This is quite
unlike the value of any shares or other securities that I may own, which
ﬂuctuate from day to day (and that is why I don’t use these securities as a
means of conducting my day-to-day transactions). But it’s central to the
stability of my daily life that I can count on my deposits in the banking
system to hold their value. Most of the time, I don’t have to ask questions
about how well each bank has been managed, even though each bank is
managed by people who are complete strangers to me. Indeed, it’s a relief
not to have to be an expert on ﬁnance to be able to use the banking
system. As Gary Gorton has put it, banking does for the nonexpert in
ﬁnance what the electricity grid does for the nonelectrician. It enables
a nonelectrician to use electricity as reliably—most of the time—as an
electrician can.2

118 • Chapter 8
How can the banking system do this? There are two parts to the
answer: ﬁrst it pools risk so as to reduce the total amount of risk, and
then it distributes the remaining unavoidable risk so as to ensure it will
be borne by those who can best aﬀord to bear it. The electricity grid does
the same. Any one person’s demand for electricity will be variable and
uncertain, and the supply of electricity from any one source may also
be variable and unreliable: wind farms and solar panels are an extreme
example since they are totally dependent on the weather, but many other
sources are exposed to serious risks. If each person who wanted to use
electricity had to arrange for its supply from an individual power source,
everyone would have to be an enough of an expert to evaluate the reliabil-
ity of each source. Everyone would be exposed every day to the vagaries
of supply, and its uncertain ﬁt with their own unpredictable demand.
Fortunately, the grid pools the overall uncertainties in both supply and
demand. The ﬂuctuations in supply from diﬀerent sources tend roughly
to even out in the aggregate, as do the ﬂuctuations in demand: as one
person switches on his oven, another is turning hers oﬀ.
But perfect certainty is an illusion. Even this pooling of risk will leave
some remaining uncertainties about overall demand and supply, so the
grid distributes the risk again, granting the highest possible certainty to
those who really value it and concentrating the risk on a smaller group
of users who are ready to accept it (in exchange for a discounted price,
of course). We household users are guaranteed a constant availability of
power because some large commercial users have contracts giving them
a discount if they agree to be disconnected when demand is unexpectedly
high, and because some power suppliers have contracts requiring them
to supply power at short notice when it is needed. And even so, there
can be unexpected power cuts from time to time.
A bank does the same thing with the risks of investment, and the
uncertainties surrounding people’s needs for access to their savings.
Some businesses fail, others succeed, but if a bank lends to a large
enough cross section of them, many of these risks will average out. But
perfect certainty is an illusion here too: there will remain some risk over-
all, so the bank distributes this risk again. Depositors are guaranteed
access to their savings, but the bank’s shareholders are not. In the event
of a shock to the overall proﬁtability of the bank’s investments, the
shareholders are the ones who have agreed to take a hit (in exchange
for a larger return than the depositors most of the time). Most of the
time, this pool-then-redistribute model of ﬁnancial risk works very well,
just as it does for the risks of electric power.

Honor among Bankers? What Caused the Financial Crisis? • 119
There is one crucial diﬀerence between banks and the electric grid:
savings are storable (even if only under the mattress), whereas electric
power is not, except in tiny quantities in batteries. You might think this
made the banking system more stable, but it does the opposite. If you
fear that your electricity grid may break down there is little point in
rushing to use all the electricity you expect ever to need in the future.
But if you fear your bank will fail and if you have no deposit insurance,
you should withdraw all of your savings now, as we saw in chapter 7. If
everyone does this, the bank will indeed fail; it may have made sound
investments but these will not be ones that can be turned into cash at a
moment’s notice. More than the electric grid, therefore, the banking sys-
tem needs to be protected against the kind of panic that makes everyone
withdraw their savings at the same time.
Deposit insurance, properly designed, can normally prevent such pan-
ics. The run on the British building society3 Northern Rock that took
place in September 2007 (and was for most of the public the ﬁrst sign
of anything wrong in the ﬁnancial system) was in many ways a freak
event. It was due to concerns that the U.K. system provided only imper-
fect deposit insurance, with only 90% protection for the bulk deposits
above a very low level, and a potentially lengthy procedure for reim-
bursement; the rules have since been changed. Nothing like it has been
repeated even as the world’s ﬁnancial system has imploded. Yet there
are occasional bank runs even in normal times, like the run on the Bank
of New England described in chapter 7. A run on the Abacus Savings
Bank in New York City in April 2003 was sparked by rumors that one
of the bank’s managers had embezzled a million dollars (prompting a
U.S. Treasury oﬃcial to observe that the real danger to depositors was
that they might be robbed carrying large quantities of cash away from
the bank).4 So while deposit insurance never quite succeeds in prevent-
ing runs completely even in normal times, it has worked well enough to
ensure that runs on banks by small depositors have been no more com-
mon in this crisis than they are in normal times. The Northern Rock run
was the exception that, by remaining exceptional, showed how normally
reliable is the rule.
The Three Mistaken Lessons of the Crisis of the 1930s
Yet the Northern Rock run was revealing because the depositors who
panicked were just the visible face of a much deeper, and much better-
founded panic: that of the professional investors. It was a panic on their

120 • Chapter 8
part that the designers and regulators of the world ﬁnancial system
had completely overlooked in their satisfaction over the resolution of
the American banking crisis of the 1930s. The banking system began
to unravel in 2007 and 2008, not because the uninformed public had
stopped trusting the banks, but because the informed banks, the big
investors, had stopped trusting each other. This was a much bigger
threat, and one that few even of the system’s insiders had foreseen. Why
did they overlook it?
The First Lesson: Don’t Run from Lions
The ﬁrst lesson wrongly drawn from the 1930s was that panics are the
cause of bank failures, rather than imminent bank failures being the
cause of panics. Like the view that running away from lions is what pro-
vokes the lions to eat you, there’s a grain of truth in this view. But it’s
a very small grain, and one on which the average uninsured depositor,
like the average unprotected tourist in a game park, would be ill-advised
to rely. In fact, many panics happen for a good reason.
There has been much debate among economic historians over the main
causes of the many bank failures before the creation of deposit insur-
ance in 1933. The earlier consensus view (due most notably to Milton
Friedman and Anna Schwartz) was that panics were the main cause of
bank failure. This has gradually given way to a more widely held view
that panics were only a small part of the story. Gary Gorton has put it
this way: “The cause of bank failures during normal times is poor man-
agement and illegal activity. During panics or recessions, more banks
fail, but as a percentage of the total failures the causes of failure are still
largely poor management and illegal activity.”5 There remains a good
deal of controversy about such ﬁndings—diagnosing the causes of bank
failure is hardly a precise science. But in any event, whatever the truth
about the 1930s and earlier crises, the crisis of the 2000s has involved
poor management and illegal activity on a spectacular scale, as we shall
see.
The Second Lesson: Professionals Don’t Panic
The second lesson wrongly drawn from the 1930s was that small
depositors—the kind eligible for deposit insurance—were the only kind
of depositors who might panic. We now know this is wrong, but there
was never any serious reason to believe it. If large corporations and other

Honor among Bankers? What Caused the Financial Crisis? • 121
banks themselves have deposits they expect to be able to call on at short
notice, and if they know that not all such deposits can be withdrawn
at the same time, then when there is any suspicion that a bank might
fail, they have as much if not more reason to rush to withdraw them as
households do. The view that only small depositors were prone to panic
seems to have been a natural outgrowth of the view that panics were
due to “irrational” fears, from which other banks and large corporations,
being experienced professional investors, were likely to be immune. Pro-
fessional investors, it was thought, would avoid badly managed banks
in the ﬁrst place, rather than investing their money in an excess of opti-
mism and then withdrawing it again in a rush. And in any case, if the
banking system is subject to prudent and detailed regulation, bad man-
agement may still occur but it will be a sporadic problem unlikely to give
rise to concerns on a large scale.
The logic of this view unravels once we accept that panics may be
due to a justiﬁed fear of bank failure. Then experienced professional
investors, being better informed, may be more prone to panics rather
than less. In fact, by training, proximity, incentives for conformity, and
by the heady intoxication of knowing they are taking risks with other
people’s money, professional investors may be subject to even greater
gusts of optimism and pessimism than are ordinary members of the pub-
lic. While prudent and detailed regulation succeeds in conﬁning failures
of management to sporadic and occasional cases, there may be little
danger of professional panics on a large scale. But once management
failures become systematic, the reaction of professional investors may
even make a bad situation worse.
Lending between banks, and deposits placed by large corporations,
have increased spectacularly in recent years. This “shadow” banking
system has operated outside the structure of regulation that applies to
traditional deposit-taking banks; that, indeed, is why it has grown so
fast. This is particularly true of the so-called “repo” markets (from “sale
and repurchase”), which provide the equivalent services for professional
investors—banks and large corporations—that ordinary bank deposits
provide for individuals and small ﬁrms. These markets have grown to
be around the same size as the total assets of the U.S. banking system—
that is, around 30,000 dollars for every man, woman, and child in the
United States.6 A much greater part of the overall wealth of the modern
U.S. economy has been passing through the hands of the professional
investment system than at any previous period in history.

122 • Chapter 8
Unlike the wealth invested in the stock market, these are not assets
whose owners know and accept that they can go down in value as
well as up: their value to their owners depends on their being more
or less instantly accessible (usually overnight) at precisely their face
value. These “deposits” are not insured, but in normal times profes-
sional investors can avoid asking questions about them, just as ordi-
nary depositors can avoid asking questions about the security of their
money, because they are secured by collateral of very high quality. In a
panic, though, the collateral is worth much less, and the evocatively titled
“haircuts” that professional investors have been taking as a markdown
on their repo transactions have risen spectacularly—from zero before
August 2007 to over 40% by the end of 2008.7 That’s a sign of how little
depositors have been willing to trust those with whom they place their
cash—it’s as though ordinary depositors were withdrawing more than
40% of their deposits from the banking system. It’s also an important
tax on anyone needing to borrow signiﬁcant amounts of cash.
The view that professional investors were cautious and prudent—nei-
ther easily persuaded to part with their money nor prone to panic and
to suddenly demanding it back—was central to the growing consensus
among policymakers in the main industrialized countries from the 1980s
onward that regulation could proceed with a light touch. Of course, a
bank could not be trusted to regulate itself, and of course its deposi-
tors could not be expected to do the job either; the latter were not well
enough informed and in any case deposit insurance had removed their
incentives to care very much. Regulators would, of course, have to keep
an eye on the bank to make sure it did not take excessive risks with
other people’s money. But regulators are always overworked, and always
underpaid relative to those they are supposed to regulate. So, it was
thought, it could only improve matters if the work of regulators could
be supplemented by that of other professionals—the bank’s creditors,
for instance, and the credit rating agencies that rated both the securi-
ties issued by the bank and the assets in which it invested. From there
it was a small step to the conclusion that the more actively were profes-
sional investors involved in ﬁnancial markets the less work there would
be for regulators to do. This logic is seductive but its consequences are
disastrous. It is like claiming that the chef will be able to do his work
better if he has some potato-peelers to help him, and concluding that
the more of the work the chef leaves to the potato-peelers the better the
meal will be.

Honor among Bankers? What Caused the Financial Crisis? • 123
Much has been written about the conﬂicts of interest that led credit
rating agencies to give high ratings to securities of very dubious quality
issued by banks on whose business they depended for their revenue:
in one now-famous internal communication, an employee of Standard
& Poor’s mused that “this product could be structured by cows and we
would still rate it.”8 These conﬂicts, important as they were, may have
been overemphasized relative to two other simpler reasons why ﬁnance
professionals were not the best regulators of what other ﬁnance profes-
sionals were doing. One was that while a bank that is buying the securi-
ties of another bank (or relying on them as collateral) may keep a hawk
eye on anything that casts doubt on the trustworthiness of the seller,
it has no interest in drawing attention to anything that casts doubt on
the reliability of a whole class of securities that it is also selling itself.
A dentist may be highly vigilant about whether another dentist is up to
the job, but don’t ask him to say anything that might lead patients to
question the reliability of dentistry in general.∗The dangers the bank-
ing system was facing in the run-up to the crisis were not, on the whole,
related to the exceptionally bad management of particular individuals
and institutions, but rather to things that almost everyone was doing in
the normal course of business.
The second simple reason why ﬁnance professionals should never
have been expected to ask tough questions of other ﬁnance profes-
sionals is that not asking questions is precisely what the banking sys-
tem enables most of its customers to do, including those who are ﬁnance
professionals. The banking system allows trust without endless interro-
gation. So-called “structured” products illustrated this perfectly.9 Just
like the electricity grid, these were complex packages of risky activities
(like mortgage loans to low-income borrowers), whose packaging lowers
the overall risk, which is then distributed unevenly between its users.
Some of the users (the owners of the “senior tranches”) were consid-
ered, like ordinary household users of the grid, to be protected from all
risk except in the case of the unthinkable, so nobody indeed considered
it worth thinking much about them. Not thinking much about them was
not an aberration due to stupidity or venality; it was the whole point of
the exercise. This made it all the more dangerous that regulators were

system is excellent at asking whether individuals have correctly followed the consen-
sus procedures; it is much less good at asking whether and when these are the right
procedures to follow.

not thinking much about such products either. Their oversight became
even more dangerous as the products became more complex, because
the temptation was to assume that complex products have the virtues
of simple ones only more so. In fact, some complex ﬁnancial products
had even fewer virtues than the simple products from which they were
derived—for instance, because apparently diﬀerent packages of mort-
gages spread risk in identical ways and therefore had highly correlated
risks of default.10
There were many people in the ﬁnancial world who stood to gain hand-
somely from perpetuating the idea that the growing sophistication of
the world’s ﬁnancial machinery meant that no hard questions needed to
be asked by anyone, and their subtle as well as not-so-subtle lobbying
(described by a former chief economist at the IMF as a “quiet coup”11)
played an important part in fueling the unsustainable boom. But those
who were fooled were also complicit to some degree in their own decep-
tion. At all events, if the point of a system is to make most people trust it
without having to think too hard, it should surprise no one that, so long
as there were no obvious accidents, most people—savers, investors, reg-
ulators, and politicians—considered the world ﬁnancial system prior to
2007 to be doing a pretty good job.
The Third Lesson: Keep Your Spirits Up
One of the more eccentric ﬁndings of recent research in neuroscience has
been to explain why it is impossible to tickle yourself.12 Surprisingly, the
explanation has applications to a much wider range of questions, one of
which is why it is impossible to make yourself richer by writing yourself
a check. Tickling appears to be caused by unexpected sensations on cer-
tain areas of the skin, and the brain of a person who is trying to tickle
herself will have anticipated the sensations that will be caused by her
ﬁngers, so they are no longer unexpected (this process of anticipation
appears to be performed by a part of the brain called the cerebellum).
She can, however, succeed in tickling herself through an intermediary—
a machine, for instance, that translates the movements of her ﬁngers
into sensations on the skin by a method indirect enough for the cere-
bellum to be unable to anticipate them. Then, although the conscious
part of her brain knows that the tickling sensation comes from her and
isn’t “really” unexpected, the cerebellum doesn’t get it, and the tickling
works.

Like how ticklish people feel, how wealthy they are is also a matter
of what they believe. This might seem strange. Surely, you might think,
somebody’s wealth is measured by what they own: their house, their
furniture, their other goods and chattels, the contents of their bank
accounts and pension plans and stock portfolios. These are objective
facts, not dependent on what somebody believes. But even if we over-
look the fact that I “own” my house only because of a tacit agreement by
other members of my society not to interfere with my living there, many
of the components of my wealth only have any value at all because of
other people’s beliefs about the future. If I own shares, the certiﬁcates
are intrinsically worthless to me. I can’t eat them, wear them or shelter
under them, and even as wallpaper they would look rather pretentious.
They are valuable only because of the rights they entail to various future
beneﬁts, many of them not at all explicit but dependent implicitly on
the good fortune and good will of other people. When share prices go
up so that I become richer, this is because other people have changed
their beliefs about the likely consequences of owning those shares. If
my house goes up in value it is also because others have changed their
beliefs about the beneﬁts of owning my house. And if I come to believe
that I shall inherit a large sum of money from an elderly relative, that in
itself makes me feel wealthier now; and it may have an impact already
on my saving and spending behavior.
This doesn’t of course mean that I can simply manipulate my own
beliefs; they have to be well founded. If by writing myself a check I come
to believe I shall have a large sum of money entering my bank account,
my belief will soon be shown up for the fantasy it is. Suppose, though,
that I reach an agreement with a friend to exchange houses with each
other for three times their current market value. Would that make us
richer? We might feel good for a while, especially if we could now say
we owned very expensive homes, but it would not take much reﬂection
to realize the hollowness of our gains. It would be like an insuﬃciently
roundabout way to tickle ourselves. The artiﬁciality of the transaction
would be hard to camouﬂage even from our earnest desire to become
rich without perceptible eﬀort.
Astonishingly, though, making ourselves feel richer by selling each
other overpriced houses is exactly what the citizens of many countries
in the industrialized world have been doing for much of the last decade.
From 1995 to 2006 consumer prices in the United States rose by 26.7%
but house prices13 rose by 167% (that means houses cost nearly three
times as much in 2006 as they had cost eleven years before). It was

126 • Chapter 8
not just the wealthy who thought they were beneﬁting. Many so-called
subprime borrowers (those whose income, employment diﬃculties, or
past credit history would ordinarily have made it diﬃcult to borrow)
signed mortgage contracts with low initial interest payments that were
programmed to rise after two years.14 The interest payments would then
become unaﬀordable unless prices could be relied upon to rise enough in
the meantime to let them borrow more to ﬁnance the interest. But since
everyone thought prices would indeed continue to rise, this seemed like a
wonderful way to make money out of nothing by getting onto the housing
ladder. Everyone thought they were getting wealthier with no sweat, like
getting ﬁtter by riding a motorized exercise bike. Not surprisingly, the
U.S. savings rate began to fall. After all, why tighten your belt saving out
of your income if you can sit back and let the rising housing market do
the saving for you? In 1995 it fell to zero—the lowest rate since the Great
Depression. Saving for the future is a fairly basic human tendency whose
disappearance takes some explaining: was America now gripped by the
fantasy of some collective elderly relative, perhaps Chinese?
In fact, the inﬂation in the price of houses had some of the elements of
a giant Ponzi scheme. Charles Ponzi, who died in 1949, was responsible
for turning the older principle of the chain letter into a serious ﬁnancial
racket. Most of us are familiar with chain letters; I ﬁrst took part in one at
the age of six, when the reward for sending on the letter was to receive
friendly postcards from those further down the line. I received some
twenty postcards in return for the one I had sent, and counted myself in
luck. Chain letters involving real money are a tempting form of fraud, not
least because those taking part can persuade themselves that everyone
else takes part voluntarily and nobody is fooled. Or rather, those taking
part are in some sense willingly fooled, since it takes no great mathemat-
ical sophistication to realize that chain letters create no wealth but only
transfer it around. For every person making money somebody else must
be losing it, and for everyone multiplying their wealth by ten, nine other
people are getting strictly nothing. Chain letters are a lottery rather than
a scam, in other words, and those who lose money in lotteries have only
themselves to blame.
Ponzi turned the chain letter principle into a proper scam. In chain
letters the proﬁts of those who take part in the early stages are ﬁnanced
by the contributions of those who join in later, until the chain collapses
(and it must collapse, since a chain letter that really worked would in
less than a dozen rounds have reached the entire population of the
planet). But at least with chain letters everyone can work out what is

Honor among Bankers? What Caused the Financial Crisis? • 127
happening; Ponzi did away with that little detail. He oﬀered an invest-
ment scheme with very impressive returns (based on exploiting a gen-
uine pricing anomaly in the market for international postal coupons). But
it could never have generated such impressive returns on such a large
scale; in fact, Ponzi was paying the early investors with the contributions
of those who came later, but pretending that the returns came from the
investments themselves. It worked with unsophisticated investors; more
surprisingly, Bernie Madoﬀshowed several decades later that it could
also work with some very sophisticated investors indeed.
Making money by watching house prices rise can be a kind of Ponzi
scheme too. Everyone has to live somewhere, so watching prices go up
as if on a taxi meter creates no real wealth. If house ownership is to be
an alternative to saving, there has to be a continual stream of willing
buyers at ever higher prices. The subprime borrowers had to be bailed
out by new buyers, or the chain would collapse. But if the logic is as
transparent as that, what made the chain so successful for so long, and
therefore its collapse so spectacular when it ﬁnally came? The answer
is that the rise in house prices, like the rise in share prices that also
took place over much of this period, was not just a Ponzi scheme. It
was started by something real, a real transformation of the prospects
for the world’s advanced economies.15 Beginning in the 1980s and gath-
ering speed in the 1990s, a number of developments came together:
greater competition, accelerating innovation, the spread of computers
and telecommunications, and above all the entry into the world econ-
omy of the two massive societies of India and China, ready to work
hard and for little reward to make goods and services for the rest of
the world. These developments began to increase the wealth of the rich
world’s citizens, including those who had done little to contribute to
the transformation, but merely had the good fortune to own a stake in
their societies at the time it happened. That stake might be a house in
a desirable location, a share portfolio, or even just a secure job with
prospects, like in government, the universities, or in a large company
with a relatively captive market. There is nothing particularly admirable
about this, but nothing at all reprehensible either: throughout history,
the majority of people who have prospered have done so by being close
enough to catch the spray when someone else strikes champagne. The
important thing to remember, though, is that the wealth that came their
way was real wealth; the world economy was really performing better,
ﬂying higher.

128 • Chapter 8
But the best conmen are those who have a real skill apart from their
plausibility, and the most successful Ponzi schemes are those that are
founded on real investment ability; it’s a delusion that only the untal-
ented need be greedy or dishonest. And the best conmen of all are those
who come to believe their own spin. That is essentially what happened
to all of us in the years of the boom. We thought that an economy that
was really growing and transforming itself could not be too good to be
true, whereas it was precisely an economy that was really growing and
transforming itself that found us with our defenses down. When the
stock market boom of the late 1990s collapsed, the authorities, like most
investors, reacted with the classic ﬁrst stage (denial) of what Elisabeth
Kübler-Ross called the ﬁve stages of grief.16 Not denial of the crash but
denial that it represented anything that needed to cause us to reevalu-
ate how wealthy we really were, and whether we could really aﬀord those
cars and televisions and expensive holidays. There was anguished debate
in policymaking circles about the risk that the collapse in the stock mar-
ket would lead to a recession. There was relief when, with help from
the central banks and their low rates of interest, and from the thrifty
Chinese, whose savings made it cheap for other people to borrow, the
rich countries’ economies continued growing with barely a hiccup. The
sensation of prosperity caused by a rising stock market—which at least
represented a judgment, if an overoptimistic one, about the transforma-
tive potential of new technologies for the world economy—was gradu-
ally replaced by a sensation of prosperity induced by a rising housing
market—which of course represented nothing of the kind. But because
a threat to conﬁdence had been averted, the relief could be heard sigh-
ing along the corridor of every central bank and ﬁnance ministry in the
Western world.
Gradually, the sigh gave way to a smile and then, as banks expanded
their lending during the boom years of the new millennium and house
prices rose ever higher in consequence, to a wonderful sense of deserved
euphoria. The great collective self-tickle had begun to work.
The Crash and Its Effects
When central bankers start to become marketing agents for the real
estate business, we should really start to worry. House prices cannot rise
for ever in relation to people’s incomes, as it is only people’s incomes
that allow them to pay for houses. What happens when they stop rising
depends on the forces that were making them rise in the ﬁrst place. If

Honor among Bankers? What Caused the Financial Crisis? • 129
people were buying houses because their price was lower than the buyers
were prepared to pay for the pleasure of living in them, then prices will
stop when they are judged just to have reached that level, and there’s no
reason for them then to fall. But if people were buying houses because
they wanted to make money out of future rises in their price, then when
the prices stop rising a whole group of buyers will drop out of the market
altogether. So a price that was attractive when it was considered the pre-
lude to future rises will no longer be attractive at all. Thus the mere
fact of ceasing to rise means that the market price is now destined to
fall.17
The immediate cause of the crash was the discovery that house prices
were no longer rising, and that as a result default rates on loans to sub-
prime borrowers were rising too.18 But on its own that seems a poor
explanation for the impact of the crash right across the globe (as P. J.
O’Rourke put it: “Jim Jerk down the road from me, with all the cars up
on blocks in his front yard, falls behind in his mortgage payments, and
the economy of Iceland implodes. I’m missing a few pieces of this puzzle
myself.”19). The truth is that the subprime market was not just a cause
but also a symptom of a looming general problem, like the ﬁrst teenager
to throw up at a party where everyone else has already overindulged.
Iceland imploded because Iceland had overindulged, just like Ireland,
Latvia, Spain, the United Kingdom, Germany, and of course the United
States.
The indulgence had taken diﬀerent forms in diﬀerent places. The sober
German citizenry had not gone on a house-buying spree, but they were
placing their deposits in banks that—unknown to most of them—were
going on an indirect house-buying spree on their behalf, by buying the
securities issued by U.S. mortgage lenders. The prudent Spanish regula-
tors had forbidden Spanish banks to do this, but the party-loving Spanish
went on a house-buying spree anyway. The banks of Iceland had been
promising implausibly high returns to their depositors and had not taken
the precaution of denominating those promises in Icelandic currency or
operating out of a subsidiary based in Nigeria. The Irish were selling each
other houses with abandon, the whole scam made more insidiously plau-
sible by the evident truth that Ireland had become a really cool place to
live. Everyone was enjoying the fact that the smooth functioning of the
banking system meant they didn’t have to ask diﬃcult questions about
its architecture, and in particular about the parts of that architecture
they couldn’t clearly see, such as the risks attached to structured deriva-
tive products and the rules determining who in the end would have to

130 • Chapter 8
bear those risks.20 Flushed by their very success, banks in many coun-
tries and not just the United States had become overstretched, like an
electricity grid that has promised so much guaranteed cheap electricity
to everyone that it can’t handle the commercial-break surge on the day
of the Super Bowl ﬁnal. The greater the overstretch the easier it is for a
small shock to cause a large crash.
Paradoxically, once the crash had occurred it was reinforced by the
very mechanisms that are supposed to work to prevent it happening in
the ﬁrst place. One of the building blocks of trust in the ﬁnancial system
is that insolvent banks must be closed so they do not suck in the sav-
ings of further unfortunate investors in a desperate attempt to return
to health. Banks that are fragile may also face such temptations, which
is why regulators keep a very close eye on them and may step in to
take action even before the insolvency line has been crossed. This vigi-
lance, so necessary to protect depositors, lays an icy hand on the bank’s
own willingness to lend to others, including to entirely creditworthy cus-
tomers. Why lend even to an excellent business in such circumstances
if you can keep your money in cash? So throughout the economy, peo-
ple who need to borrow, if only to pay their workforces and keep their
businesses going, may be unable to ﬁnd credit while others, who have
savings but nothing rewarding to spend them on for the time being, dare
not place those savings in the bank for fear that tomorrow the bank will
no longer exist. Yet if it no longer exists it will be because a regulator
has closed it. This is a startling breakdown of the architecture of social
trust that the banking system supports, with the regulators who are its
master architects cast as the demolition engineers who at any moment
could pull out a cornerstone.
Why Do We Do This?
Why do human societies systematically delude themselves in this way?
What makes us collectively bipolar when the individually bipolar among
us are only a small minority? Asking the question in this way does not
imply that everyone in the boom years was behaving irrationally—on
the contrary, many ﬁnanciers were gambling quite rationally on their
being able to reap proﬁts if things went well and to be bailed out if
things went badly. The deeper question is why the rest of us were com-
plicit in our own deception when, as I have tried to argue in this chapter,
there was abundant evidence that should have made regulators, politi-
cians, and citizens think twice. Flawed regulation may have led some

Honor among Bankers? What Caused the Financial Crisis? • 131
rational ﬁnanciers to behave in ways that damaged the rest of society,
but why did the rest of society show such enthusiasm for letting them
do so?
Ideological blinkering is only the beginning of the story; we still need to
understand why the blinkers were so eﬀective when their consequences
were so costly. In their book Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology
Drives the Economy and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism,21 the
economists George Akerlof and Robert Shiller set out ﬁve main ways
in which modern economies depend on the characteristics of human
psychology: our need for conﬁdence in the future, our strong sense
of fairness, our anger and resentment when our trust is betrayed, cer-
tain perceptual failings that make us subject to money illusion, and our
attachment to narratives to help us in making sense of our lives. They
make a compelling case for the importance of all ﬁve factors in fueling
both the ﬁnancial crisis and the boom that preceded it.
Other factors could be added of which I would cite three. The ﬁrst
is a systematic weakness in our ability to evaluate small risks of highly
damaging events that have not occurred in the recent past, such as cor-
related defaults on various classes of apparently low-risk loans. This is
particularly true when most of the time our assets are protected, as they
are when the banking system is work well, because it encourages us to
push the risky events to the back of our minds.
The second factor that makes us vulnerable is a fascination with strate-
gic reasoning of the third and fourth degree that is inapplicable to prob-
lems of the thousandth degree: faced with evidence that a housing boom
can’t continue forever, we don’t unravel it back to the beginning but try
to ride the boom till the very end, to do just a little better than the very
best of the others. The third is a weakness for trusting groups of insiders
who are like us (other ﬁnance professionals, for instance), coupled with
an instinctive hostility to unwelcome messages if they are delivered by
someone suﬃciently diﬀerent from us, and an intense sensitivity to tiny
diﬀerences in status between those we admit to our circle of insiders and
those we do not. These are all familiar characteristics of the group-living
primates from whom we evolved.
As earlier chapters of this book have emphasized, it should hardly
be surprising to ﬁnd some psychological weaknesses in the makeup of
Homo sapiens sapiens, that species of great ape that ﬁrst appeared on
the African woodland savanna somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000
years ago. Apart from the restlessness that led this ape to leave Africa,
nothing it did during more than 90% of its existence betrayed any signs

132 • Chapter 8
of an interest in banking and ﬁnance, nor any talents that might sub-
sequently lead it to a career on Wall Street. It was a group-living pri-
mate, with characteristics that are common to most species of group-
living primate, notably a combination of strong competitive instincts
with a tendency to form coalitions and groups, and a highly sensi-
tive alertness to distinctions of status and rank. But it was also a very
unusual kind of primate, a large-brained social ape colonizing a very
particular ecological niche involving cooperative hunting and gather-
ing in increasingly sophisticated ways. Its impressive cooperative tal-
ents developed against a background of violent feuding that led to the
destruction of many of the initial achievements of its ﬁrst attempts at
large-scale social organization. When it ﬁnally built a multitrillion dollar
ﬁnancial system that spanned the earth, it was hardly surprising to ﬁnd
that a number of ﬂaws had crept into the construction.
One advantage of this long perspective is that it helps us to be appro-
priately modest about the prospects for preventing further economic
crises in the future. This is the argument pursued in the rest of this
book. Our societies and economies are, in their complexity, both fruitful
and fragile. Large-brained social apes built the world ﬁnancial system
and large-brained social apes have done a lot of damage to that system,
but only large-brained social apes can ﬁx it. Any solution to its ﬂaws has
to be robust to being operated by the same kinds of large-brained social
apes that caused the problem in the ﬁrst place.
Another advantage of the long view is that it helps to keep a sane
perspective on the costs of the crisis. It’s too early to tell whether the
world economy will return to growth again within three or four years,
or whether there will be a prolonged slump—still less to know whether
unrest and violence will accompany the harsh retrenchment that will be
necessary in some countries. But these risks are small beside the dangers
that human cooperation has surmounted in the past, and the violent
breakdown in the social order that has often accompanied wars against
outsiders and the repression of the defenseless at home. As chapter 3
emphasized, the cooperation on which modern economies are built is the
same cooperation that has, to an extent few modern citizens appreciate,
successfully tamed our taste and our talent for violence. As we calculate
anxiously the risks and rewards of our current economic strategies we
are like poker players on the slopes of a volcano, savoring the adrenalin
rush from the ﬂurry of the cards while the real menace lies slumbering
at our feet.

“Some say the world will end in ﬁre, some say in ice,” wrote Robert
Frost. Fire now looks a great deal more probable than ice, but whatever
the truth of that conjecture, we can be reasonably conﬁdent that the
world will not end through a ﬁnancial crisis. That the ﬁnancial crisis
is now, at time of writing in 2009, the major preoccupation of all the
world’s political leaders says something not just about the shortness of
our memories and the limitations of our horizons, but also about how
astonishingly far we have come. The fact that it is the very limitations of
our horizons that have enabled us to come so far will be the subject of
chapter 9.

Professionalism and Fulﬁllment in Work and War
Soldiers and Philosophers
[T]en thousand Greek mercenaries are hired under false pretences by a
Persian prince, Cyrus the younger, for an expedition into the hinterland
of Asia Minor, whose real aim was to oust Cyrus’s brother Artaxerxes II;
but they are defeated at the battle of Cunaxa, and now leaderless and
far from their native land, they have to ﬁnd a way back home amidst
very hostile peoples. All they want is to go back home, but everything
they do constitutes a public menace: there are ten thousand of them,
armed, but without food, so wherever they go they ravage and destroy
the land like a swarm of locusts, and carry in their wake a huge following
of women.
Thus Italo Calvino describes the predicament of a meandering army
in the ﬁfth century b.c.e., one similar to many thousands of others
through the course of history and unusual only in that one of its oﬃ-
cers, Xenophon, recorded its passage in a book that has survived for us
and is called The Anabasis. After comparing Xenophon with the later
writer T. E. Lawrence, and noting—with some approval—that in contrast
to Lawrence’s aestheticizing vision, “with the Greek there is nothing
beneath the exactness and dryness of the narration,” Calvino goes on
to say:
Of course there is a kind of pathos in the Anabasis: it is the anxiety
of the soldiers to return home, the bewilderment of being in a foreign
land, the anxiety not to get separated, because as long as they are still
together they carry their own country within them. … In these memoirs
of a general from the ﬁfth century b.c.e., the contrast is between the
role of locust-like parasites to which the Greek army of mercenaries had
been reduced and the exercise of the classical virtues—philosophical,
civic, military virtues—which Xenophon and his men try to adapt to
these new circumstances. … Man can be reduced to a locust but can
apply to this condition of locust a code of discipline and decorum—in
a word, “style”—and consider himself satisﬁed; man is capable of not
even discussing for a minute the fact that he is a locust but only the
best way of being one. In Xenophon we ﬁnd already delineated, with

Professionalism and Fulﬁllment in Work and War • 135
all its limitations, the modern ethic of perfect technical eﬃciency, of
being “up to the job,” of “doing your job well” quite independently of
what value is put on one’s actions in terms of universal morals. … In
this attempt to give a certain “style” or rule to this parasitical move-
ment of greedy and violent men amidst the mountains and plains of
Anatolia resides all his dignity: not tragic dignity but rather a limited
dignity, fundamentally a bourgeois dignity … the Greek army, creeping
through the mountain heights and fjords amidst constant ambushes
and attacks, no longer able to distinguish just to what extent it is a
victim or an oppressor, and surrounded even in the most chilling mas-
sacres of its men by the supreme hostility or indiﬀerence of fortune,
inspires in the reader an almost symbolic anguish which perhaps only
we today can understand.1
Nowhere more than in an army does the health of the whole depend so
totally upon the absolute reliability of the parts. Armies everywhere seek
through the rigor of their training to impart adherence to a code, a set of
procedures, and what can also be called an ethic, which together aim to
ensure loyalty even in the face of overwhelming individual temptations
to betrayal. This code is transmitted through the procedures of train-
ing, everything from the mindless repetition of parade-ground drill to
the complex task mastery of the military engineer. It is also transmitted
through the atmosphere of the military institution, whether this be the
high-mindedness of the academy, the clubby vulgarity of the mess, or
the intensity of the shared bivouac or the night exercise. This code, once
it has been mastered to the point of second nature, can be called tunnel
vision in its starkest form, one that not only ignores speculation about
the wider consequences of adherence but seeks deliberately to exclude
such speculation. At the Nuremberg war-crimes trial of 1945–46, this
code came up against the onslaught of a diﬀerent, more universalizing
conception of human duty.2
Rudolf Höss, the former commandant of the Auschwitz concentration
camp, though not himself on trial, was among those called to give evi-
dence at Nuremberg. His testimony included heartrending details of the
gassing of prisoners, after which he was asked, “Did you yourself ever
feel pity with the victims, thinking of your own family and children?” He
replied, “Yes.” The examination continued: “How was it possible for you
to carry out these actions in spite of this?” Höss replied, “In view of all
these doubts which I had, the one and only decisive argument was the
strict order and the reason given for it by the Reichsführer Himmler.”
The defendants in the trial also resorted to what has since become
known as the Nuremberg defense, namely, that they were only following

136 • Chapter 9
orders. Few of them gave it a rationale, but Franz von Papen, who had
been chancellor of the Reich in 1932 and later Hitler’s representative
in Vienna and then Ankara, was one who did. Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe
asked: “Why didn’t you after this series of murders [of his close friends
and associates] which had gone on over a period of 4 years, why didn’t
you break with these people and stand up like General Yorck or any other
people that you may think of from history, stand up for your own views
and oppose these murderers? Why didn’t you do it?”
Von Papen replied:
If you ask me, Sir David, why despite everything I remained in the ser-
vice of the Reich, then I can only say that … I did my duty—my duty to
Germany, if you wish to know. I can understand very well, Sir David, that
after all the things we know today, after the millions of murders which
have taken place, you consider the German people a nation of crimi-
nals, and that you cannot understand that this nation has its patriots
as well. I did these things in order to serve my country, and I should
like to add, Sir David, that up to the time of the Munich Agreement,
and even up to the time of the Polish campaign, even the major powers
tried, although they knew everything that was going on in Germany, to
work with Germany. Why do you wish to reproach a patriotic German
with acting likewise, and with hoping likewise, for the same thing for
which all the major powers hoped?
Hermann Göring, the most articulate of all those on trial, was adamant
about the unrealistic nature of the standard to which the defendants
were being held. He was scathing about the impracticability of applying
the Hague Convention of 1907 to the conditions of a modern war, and
when questioned about the possibility of disobedience to Hitler’s will,
asked the court:
How does one imagine that a state can be led if, during a war, or before
a war, which the political leaders have decided upon, whether wrongly
or rightly, the individual general could vote whether he was going to
ﬁght or not, whether his army corps was going to stay at home or not,
or could say “I must ﬁrst ask my division”?
As von Papen and Göring knew only too well—and as many of the judges
and prosecutors uncomfortably realized—ethical considerations are a
fragile restraint against the overwhelming sense of urgency that war-
fare demands from its participants. The Nuremberg process was riddled
with contradictions in any case: the senior Soviet tribunal member I. T.
Nikitchenko had been one of the three prosecutors at the ﬁrst of Stalin’s
show trials in 1936 and was so unused to the concept of a dissenting

Professionalism and Fulﬁllment in Work and War • 137
opinion that he had to ask his Western colleagues how to formulate
one when—on orders from Moscow—he objected to the leniency of their
sentencing.3
The Search for Narratives
The ability to see the limitations of particular individual perspectives,
and their proper place in some overall scheme of things, is a remark-
able human capacity for whose evolution we still have only a partial
explanation.4 It is all the more remarkable since societies with the leisure
to develop and reward this ability among their citizens have usually had
to call upon considerable single-mindedness, both military and commer-
cial, in order to achieve so great a degree of material success. The histo-
rian Peter Hall has noted that the civilization of ancient Athens, to which
we owe just that concern with the right way to live and the capacity for
inquiry into human nature that can be described as the foundation of
the Nuremberg vision, expressed an attitude to trade and the division
of labor so ambivalent as to amount almost to institutionalized denial:
“From the sea the Greeks got trade, and from trade came ideas, and
then empire; but from empire came wealth, and with wealth leisure and
the opportunity to create new ideas and new art. … [But] there was an
emerging contradiction: the old aristocratic value system said it was hon-
ourable to earn one’s living in agriculture, or even in the higher forms of
business and banking; but retail trade and manual labour, even crafts-
manship, were ignoble.”5 He quotes an earlier historian, H. Michell, as
saying that “the citizen was an aristocrat who disliked manual labour;
lounging in the market place and gossiping, or occupying himself with
the endless political intrigues of the state was much more to his taste, if
he could aﬀord it.”
In much less dramatic ways than the army, almost all occupations in
a modern society embody an ethic, a code. For trust requires an assur-
ance of reliability, and some of the most eﬀective policemen are inter-
nal, lodged in the surveillance mechanisms of the individual personality.
The ﬁercest external vigilance will rarely be enough to ensure the hon-
esty of a really determined cheat, so it is far better to deal with people
whose character, training, or upbringing leads them not to want to cheat
even when they have the chance. Those who can convince others of their
intrinsic honesty may thereby prosper, and it may be easier for the gen-
uinely honest to be thus convincing—the more so if honesty, or at least
the true and honorable performance of a certain trade or skill, requires

138 • Chapter 9
a degree of style, conﬁdence, even grace, built up over a long period
of commitment to the task, that are hard for an opportunist to feign.
Even so-called unskilled work involves people in learning how to ﬁt into
a team, on the construction site, on the fruit farm, in the workshop, at
the checkout counter. And most kinds of professional training, whether
apprenticeship as a mechanic or studying for the bar or attending an
oﬀ-site course as a chef, involve learning not just how to accomplish
particular tasks but how to project yourself as a certain kind of person.6
One consequence is that many people have a training that appears dis-
proportionate to the tasks they subsequently need to undertake (or to
put it another way, many people are challenged less by the work they do
than they are led to expect during their training). Another consequence is
that people need to ﬁnd within them the commitment to persevere with
the process of learning how to project themselves in this way. At the
very least, for someone to have this commitment, she needs to be able
to explain to herself the purpose for which her commitment is made. In
a word, she needs a narrative of her life and her work.
For a long period in recorded history, that narrative was supplied to
individual members of society by their social order and its public rela-
tions oﬃcers, that is to say, its poets, philosophers, and priests. The
Indian caste system can be understood as an elaborate social expression
of what was originally a division of labor; soldiers, priests, merchants,
farmers, potters, leather workers, and other occupational groups were
assigned to castes that were not allowed to intermarry, nor even to live in
the same neighbourhood.7 The citizens of modern India have developed
a sophisticated division of labor to which these categories are now wildly
inappropriate, and yet the narrative retains a startling power to govern
the behavior of individuals, as a glance at the matrimonial columns of
any Indian newspaper will conﬁrm. Intercaste marriages remain rare,
and for reasons that are self-reinforcing. In all societies, even if the con-
ventions underlying social compatibility are arbitrary ones, marriages
based on social compatibility can last longer and weather crises better
than ones that set social and erotic bonds in conﬂict with each other, as
countless unsung Romeos and Juliets of the suburbs have found to their
cost. Shakespeare killed his young lovers because he could not bear to
imagine them in resentful middle age.
The European feudal system similarly furnished its members with a
narrative, one that was still being celebrated hundreds of years after the
system had begun to crumble: “The rich man in his castle, / The poor

Professionalism and Fulﬁllment in Work and War • 139
man at his gate, / He made them high or lowly, / And ordered their
estate,” as the Victorian hymnal tells us.
Finer poets and more farsighted priests had seen the shifting of the
sands long before, however. They knew that the social order was too
fragile to have been ordained by God for all eternity. In a sermon deliv-
ered in 1622 John Donne, the dean of St. Paul’s, reminded his audience
of the transiency of social distinctions:
[Death] comes equally to us all, and makes us all equal when it comes.
The ashes of an Oak in the Chimney, are no epitaph of that Oak, to
tell me how high or how large that was; It tells me not what ﬂocks it
sheltered while it stood, nor what men it hurt when it fell. The dust of
great persons’ graves is speechless too, it says nothing, it distinguishes
nothing: As soon the dust of a wretch whom thou wouldest not, as of
a Prince whom thou couldest not look upon, will trouble thine eyes, if
the wind blow it thither; and when a whirlwind hath blown the dust of
the Churchyard into the Church, and the man sweeps out the dust of
the Church into the Churchyard, who will undertake to sift those dusts
again, and to pronounce, This is the Patrician, this is the noble ﬂower,
and this the yeomanly, this the Plebeian bran?8
Donne knew that the apparently eternal verities of status and social
position were all dissolved in death. But in truth they had long been
threatened by the more mundane solvent of economic change. As late
medieval society saw the old categories shift, a trickle of sons began to
ask themselves whether they should aspire only to do the same work as
their fathers (daughters were to ﬁnd it hard for centuries to ask analo-
gous questions about their mothers). The question became inevitable not
only because the division of labor was accelerating and new opportuni-
ties were opening up but also because those new opportunities required
aptitudes that were speciﬁc to the individual and could not simply be
handed down from father to son. Workers moved to the cities, guilds
were challenged by new forms of production, workshops and depots
set up in chaotic competition against one another. And the narratives
they told were in competition too. An individual no longer had a single
public identity as the occupant of a place in a known order but rather
had multiple public identities: apprentice, brother, friend, citizen, war-
rior, competitor. Hamlet is an intellectual, a lover, a prince: but he is
also a son, a fatherless son, and he is tormented because he can neither
deny this identity nor make its demands compatible with the demands
of these other identities.
It is one of the recurring refrains of modern life that as the individ-
ual comes to rely more and more upon others to supply the necessities

140 • Chapter 9
of his daily existence, he can no longer simply borrow from others the
narrative that is to make sense of his life but must fashion his own. The
division of labor in production requires a stern self-suﬃciency in respect
to the story of our own lives. In one of the most famous and melancholy
accounts of the consequences of modernization, Emile Durkheim argued
that some individuals would fail to create a narrative to compensate for
the rootlessness of life in the modern city, and the most desolate among
them would turn to suicide. In eﬀect, the war between multiple identi-
ties within a person can destroy them all, leading to no identity at all. It
represents the same danger for the individual personality as the danger
we have already noted for the individual’s occupation: to survive in the
modern division of labor, each individual must acquire some capacity,
some skill. But some individuals will ﬁnd that the skills they have are
inadequate to the demands the world makes of them, just as some indi-
viduals will ﬁnd that the narrative they have constructed out of their
multiple identities is inadequate to make sense of the demands these
identities impose upon them.
Durkheim’s theory of suicide has been much debated and criticized,
notably for being almost impossible to test.9 It may or may not turn out
to be useful for scientiﬁc understanding or social diagnosis, but it is a
very intuitive and reasonable conjecture about what happens to some of
the people who build an identity for themselves in a world shot through
with risk. This conjecture follows from three observations. The ﬁrst is
that in order to exchange with strangers people need a way to signal their
trustworthiness. The second is that one of the most eﬀective ways to do
this is to create an identity for yourself, a set of internal rules in which
you yourself believe and by which you live, and which will make you
unhappy if you fail to honor them. The third is that dealing with mul-
tiple strangers creates conﬂicts between diﬀerent components of this
identity. Although we should expect evolution to have endowed most of
us with the psychological resources to manage these conﬂicts, the sheer
randomness of modern life—the accidental nature of so many of our
encounters, projects, and challenges—will make some of them very dif-
ﬁcult for some people to bear. Some recent studies of depression are con-
sistent with this view. For instance, episodes of moderate depression in
young adults appear to perform a useful adaptive function, helping them
adjust their aspirations to a more realistic assessment of their potential.
Severe depression, on the other hand, can be triggered by an apparent
inability to adjust aspirations in this way.10

Professionalism and Fulﬁllment in Work and War • 141
Even in contexts less dramatic than among the suicidal, the capac-
ity of people to ﬁnd satisfaction in their work and in their lives may
depend as much on their ability to reconcile the conﬂicting demands of
their multiple identities as on the objective conditions of their lives. The
sociologist Frank Furedi has written (in his book Paranoid Parenting11)
about the widespread perception that children in modern society get too
little attention from parents obsessed with jobs and careers. He claims
that recent decades have seen a dramatic increase, not in the time par-
ents spend at work, but in the time they spend with their children. “Even
full-time employed women with children devoted more time to childcare
in 1995 than non-employed mothers did in 1961.” Whether or not this
startling claim is true (and it’s hard to document such changes rigor-
ously), it is clear that society now has very diﬀerent expectations about
the parenting role: “today’s parents must pay attention to every moment
of their child’s day—ensuring that their lives are ﬁlled with stimulating
and appropriate activities.” It is quite possible, then, for parents to be ful-
ﬁlling their role more faithfully, and simultaneously feeling worse about
it, than ever before.
More optimistically than Durkheim, the American oral historian Studs
Terkel set out in his book Working to recount the many ways in which
people tell the story of their everyday lives. Such a book might simply
have been a collage of stories of how people live and work, but it is much
more than this. His subjects talk not only of what they do but of the shape
this activity gives to their lives (the book’s subtitle is “People Talk about
What They Do All Day and How They Feel about What They Do”). His
much-quoted story of the parking lot attendant is a masterpiece of Zen
concentration:
After twenty-ﬁve, thirty years I could drive any car like a baby, like
a woman change her baby’s diaper. I could handle that car with one
hand. I had a lot of customers would say “How you do this? The way
you go around this way?” I’d say “Just the way you bake a cake, miss, I
can handle this car.” A lotta ladies come to you and a lot of gentlemen
come to you, say “Wow! You can drive!” I say “Thank you ma’am.” They
say, “How long you been doin’ it?” I say, “Thirty years. I started when I
was sixteen and I’m still doin’ it.” … I was so good when I was nineteen,
twenty. A guy bet me ﬁve dollars that when a certain car came in I
wouldn’t make a hole. I had one hand and I whipped it into that hole,
and I did it three times for him. Another guy said, “You’re too short
to reach the gas pedal.” I said, “No, I can even push the seat back and
I can sit and swing that car in with one swing”—when I was younger I
had one customer, he was a good six feet seven and I’m only ﬁve feet

142 • Chapter 9
three. He said, “You better pull the seat up.” It looked like I was sittin’
in the back seat and I was barely touchin’ the brake. I whipped his car
in the hole. He said, “You mean to tell me, short as you are, you put
the car in that hole there?” I said “I never move anybody’s seat.” I may
pull myself up and brace from the wheel, but I never miss that hole. I
make that one swing, with one hand, no two hands. And never use the
door open, never park a car with the door open. Always I have my head
inside the car, lookin’ from the back-view mirror. That’s why they call
me Lovin’ Al the Wizard, One-Swing Al.12
Notable in this and many other extracts is a sense that the activity, how-
ever humble it may seem, has a wider signiﬁcance, often barely articu-
lated. Without such a sense it is hard to see how anyone could devote
himself so single-mindedly to mastering the necessary skills, nor apply
himself so faithfully to performing them with rigor and with love every
working day for years on end.
For all the extravagance of recent claims that the world of work is
under threat of dissolution from new technology, the workplace remains
one of the most important means through which the values of soci-
ety are transmitted between individuals. It is as important as fami-
lies and schools, whose inﬂuence, though formative, is exerted for a
much shorter time. Most individuals cannot survive outside a working
environment—genuinely lone artists are very rare. They depend for their
economic viability on the skills and capacities of their colleagues, in ways
whose consequences for the structure of businesses will be explored in
a later chapter. This very dependence makes them particularly prone to
give a privileged place to the needs and demands of their workplace in
the narrative they construct of their own lives.13
Yet the very distance imposed by a narrative framework—a step back
from immersion in the detail of our working lives—can for some peo-
ple create a vertiginous sense of the futility of the whole endeavor. This
may be because our narratives prompt unrealistic ambitions, so that we
are easily dispirited by the constant intrusion of the tired, the ungainly,
and the mediocre into our own lives. Or they may disconnect our ener-
gies altogether: the concerns that seem so urgent to us because of the
demands of tunnel vision shrink to insigniﬁcance from a more objective
perspective. The variety that is part of the buzz of modern living and a
part of what makes for challenging work,14 can come to seem like mind-
less dissipation. The eﬀect can be tragic, or comic, or both. Here, from
Georges Perec’s Life: A User’s Manual, is a description of the working life
of a television producer, one of the characters in the novel:

Professionalism and Fulﬁllment in Work and War • 143
Rorschash lived out his career entirely in oﬃce buildings. Under the
vague title of “Project Manager” or “Director of Restructuring and
Associated Initiatives,” his only activities consisted of daily attendance
at meetings, conferences, committees, preparatory workshops, AGMs,
interdisciplinary consultations, plenary sessions, working groups and
the other such gatherings that represent, at this level of the hierarchy,
the essence of the life of such an organization, with their telephone
calls, conversations in corridors, business lunches, screenings of rushes
and business trips abroad. Nothing stops us from imagining that, dur-
ing one such meeting, he could have launched the idea of a Franco-
British opera or a historical series inspired by Suetonius, but it is more
likely that he spent his time preparing or commenting upon audience
ﬁgures, picking at budgets, writing reports about the booking levels
of editing studios, dictating memos, or rushing from meeting-room to
meeting-room, taking care to make himself always indispensable in at
least two places at once so that, barely seated, he would be called to
the telephone and obliged immediately to depart.15
In the three decades since Perec wrote, computers, electronic mail, and
portable telephones have done nothing to diminish the satirical energy
of his vision.
Professional Codes and Tunnel Vision
More worryingly, though, some narratives of our working lives, far from
unsettling and depressing us, may not unsettle us enough. They may
reinforce our tunnel vision precisely when its more distant consequences
are most disturbing. Why?
A narrative may serve to give the individual a kind of equilibrium amid
the conﬂicting demands of the modern world. But does what serves the
individual’s equilibrium also serve the interests of the wider world? What
we have seen of the narrowness of tunnel vision gives us reason to pause.
Let us start with an extreme example. A report issued by Amnesty Inter-
national in February 2001 claimed that over 150 companies around the
world manufacture electroshock stun equipment, whose use is almost
exclusively conﬁned to the torture chamber.16 There are some restric-
tions on trade in such equipment, but not many, and such restrictions
as there are serve only to underline the nature of its most probable appli-
cation: for instance, the German government does not allow the weapons
to be used in German prisons or by German police on German residents
but allows German companies to market and sell them for use abroad.
The great majority of the companies making such equipment are not

144 • Chapter 9
criminal organizations but ordinary businesses, with oﬃces where peo-
ple who have families and careers meet, talk, cluster from time to time
around the coﬀee machine, and share a sense of collective endeavor.
A Studs Terkel who arrived with a tape recorder in hand would doubt-
less ﬁnd as much humor, philosophy, and even Zen-like concentration
in such a business as in many of the others whose employees he inter-
viewed. The anthropologist Hugh Gusterson has documented the sub-
tle way in which young, often politically liberal men with doctorates
in physics turned into convinced and professional designers of nuclear
weapons at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California.17 This was
drawn to my attention by Luhrmann (2000), itself a brilliant account of
the subtle but far-reaching consequences of a certain professional train-
ing, namely, in psychiatry. Indeed, the dislocation between the emotions
and qualities fostered in people by their immediate environment and
the more distant consequences of their activities was a central theme
in a later book by Studs Terkel, The Good War. It was inspired by the
paradox that for many veterans, World War II was the ﬁnest moment of
their lives, “a moment in history … when buddies felt they were more
important, were better men who amounted to more than they do now.
It’s a precious memory.”18 The preciousness of the memory appears to
have been unrelated to the ostensible aim of the war (to rid the world of
the Nazi regime) and undiminished by the fact that many individual sol-
diers even on the Allied side were involved in atrocities for which there
was no conceivable military justiﬁcation. It was a product of local bond-
ing, of a relationship between soldiers and their service units that bore
close structural similarities to the hunting groups of our male ancestors.
Eﬀective armies are often those that have known exactly how to exploit
these similarities, as anthropologists Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd
have argued.19
The division of labor between soldiers and other citizens is only an
imperfect analogy for the division of labor among civilian members of
society, and—fortunately—no one can plausibly claim that tunnel vision
typically takes as intense a form outside the army as within it. The
overwhelming majority of businesses do not manufacture torture equip-
ment, and the degree of dislocation required to dissociate oneself from
the consequences of one’s actions is much less striking in most of the
ordinary world of work. But conscientious managers can still drive their
employees to stress and misery in an honorable quest to run their busi-
nesses well; conscientious trade unionists can still inﬂict workplace dis-
ruption that harms those whose cause they wish to serve; conscientious

Professionalism and Fulﬁllment in Work and War • 145
scientists can still devise chemicals that pollute the earth, and consci-
entious political activists can still inﬂict harm on people thousands of
miles away in whose name they believe themselves to be acting. The con-
sequences of their actions can never be corrected purely by an appeal to
their honor or their professionalism, because it is precisely to their honor
and professionalism that the consequences are due. To put it another
way, it is the task of politics more than of ethics to provide tunnel vision
with its appropriate countervailing power.
Warfare is also a terrible reminder of how hard it can sometimes be to
reconcile the conﬂicting visions to which tunnel vision gives rise. We have
no books written by Xenophon’s victims, but later wars have more than
compensated for this deﬁciency.20 A mother sees her son return at the
end of a war, during which she had no idea whether or when she would
ever see him again. She senses in him an echo of her frightened little
boy, let loose in a strange and violent world, negotiating hazards he can
scarcely imagine and that she can picture only by giving them dim and
terrible shapes. She knows that he has aged, in body and in spirit, and her
relief that he has survived this test, when so many of his friends did not,
makes her reluctant to question her sense of deliverance. What can she
say to another mother, a thousand miles away, whose daughter’s corpse
lies in an unmarked grave, abandoned after her rape and torture by a
platoon of advancing soldiers drunk with lust and fear? The bewildered
boys who light up their mothers’ eyes at the end of a war may be the
same as the marauding monsters who formerly darkened the land over
which they moved. The diﬀerence is one of geography and timing.
We may be shocked by evidence that brings home to us the unswerv-
ing ﬁerceness of a military training, though the atrocities of war—of all
war—are by now so well documented that none of us who votes to send
soldiers to war has any excuse for innocence about the consequences.
But we all avert our gaze to some degree from the more distant repercus-
sions of the ways we work and live and cultivate a systematic deafness to
their more disturbing echoes. We could not navigate in the bewildering
complexity of our social world if it were not so—if we did not have rules
of loyalty, of doing as others expect of us, of conforming to a code that
betrays our three-dimensional sense of ourselves but is the only code
simple enough for us to convey reliably to others. And we need others
to follow their codes too: we may be hurt by those who are ﬁerce, but we
could not trust those who were never unswerving. Still, in our moments
of reﬂection we need to understand the unintended consequences of our
tunnel vision for the world as a whole. This is the task of part III.

Epilogue to Parts I and II
Part I described how a surprising degree of coordination can be achieved
by a system of decentralized activity of production and exchange in
which individuals are concerned about nothing more than what is hap-
pening in the markets for the things they buy and sell. Modern economic
analysis has made this claim very precise.1 Speciﬁcally, markets that sat-
isfy a number of key conditions achieve Pareto-eﬃciency, in which all
opportunities for making individuals better oﬀwithout harming others
have been exhausted. The most important of these conditions are:
• There are large numbers of buyers and sellers (so that no one party
has the ability to manipulate the market).
• There are no direct interdependencies (known as externalities)
between individuals other than through their all being participants
in the market; one individual’s actions do not directly aﬀect the
welfare of another.
• There is complete information available to all relevant parties about
the quality of the goods being traded.
In reality, no markets precisely satisfy all these conditions, but mar-
kets where the conditions are not too ﬂagrantly violated are likely to
behave with a reasonable degree of eﬃciency.2 Economic analysis also
tells us where to look for signs that markets may be failing to coordinate
activity eﬃciently: look out for monopoly, or for externalities like pol-
lution, or for circumstances where some participants know much more
than others about the quality of the goods being traded (as in the used
car market). The theory also suggests ways to begin to tackle these prob-
lems: try to foster more competition where possible; try to make sure
that polluters bear the true costs of the damage they cause; and try to
ensure that sellers have an incentive (through regulation, for instance)
not to deceive buyers.
More recently, economic theorists have systematically compared the
merits of imperfect decentralized markets to those of (also imperfect)

148 • Epilogue to Parts I and II
centralized administrative structures in tackling diﬀerent kinds of task.
So, for instance, where the costs of coordination failure are very high, and
the costs of squandering resources to achieve coordination are compar-
atively low (as in directing an airplane safely to its destination), markets
subject to information frictions may pose unacceptable risks of system
failure.3 Such considerations explain why so many advanced industrial-
ized countries have opted for centralized government intervention and
planning in wartime—a choice that has often left them shackled with
bureaucratic structures unsuited for responding to the challenges of
peacetime. Economists have also explored the risks of globalization in a
world in which markets for risk sharing are imperfectly developed.4
Impressive as it is, the theory of competitive and eﬃcient markets has
two major gaps. The ﬁrst is that Pareto-eﬃciency says nothing about
equality: if the poor cannot be made better oﬀwithout harming the rich,
competitive markets will not help them. In fact, the history of recent
economic development suggests that the poor and the rich can have a
mutual interest in exchange,5 but it’s important to remember that com-
petitive markets are about exploring avenues of mutual interest, not
about redressing preexisting imbalances of power and wealth.
The second gap is that the theory says nothing about what makes it
reasonable for individuals to trust those with whom they have to deal. It
takes for granted that when people make deals and write contracts with
each other, the deals will be respected and the contracts carried out. The
fact that the people in modern market societies do seem to trust each
other enough, most of the time, at least to do business together is one
important reason why these societies can achieve such feats of decen-
tralized coordination. But it is a fact that requires in turn an explanation
of its own. Why do we believe that strangers can usually be trusted? This
was the subject of part II.
The divorce between an interest in the psychological and cultural foun-
dations of economic life and an interest in the consequences of economic
interaction has been a peculiar feature of professional economics during
the second half of the twentieth century, rather than an intrinsic charac-
ter of the subject. Indeed, Adam Smith famously wrote about both “The
Moral Sentiments” and “The Wealth of Nations,”6 and the economics pro-
fession has been rediscovering the intimate links between these themes,
as a book by Peter Dougherty describes.7 Part II focused on a subset of
the many questions that have been explored in this literature, namely,
why people are willing to trust strangers, and what happens when this
trust becomes fragile. The diﬃculty people face in trusting the quality

Epilogue to Parts I and II • 149
of the goods oﬀered by their trading partners has been the subject of
a vast literature in the ﬁeld that has come to be known as “the eco-
nomics of information.”8 The fact that this might prevent some markets
from functioning well, or even from existing at all, was the subject of
a famous article on the used car market (“The Market for Lemons”) by
George Akerlof.9 Akerlof’s point was that when some traders sell low-
quality goods, buyers will be so cautious that even sellers of high-quality
goods cannot get a reasonable price unless they can ﬁnd some credible
way to signal the quality of what they are selling.
There has also been a great deal written on the question of whether
people might be more willing to trust one another if they deal with each
other repeatedly, so that cooperation today takes place in the hope of
inducing cooperation in the future. This literature has concluded that
repeated interaction can indeed help to build trust if it is reasonably
frequent (that is, provided the future matters enough relative to the
present), if individuals can observe reliably enough how others have
behaved, and if the cost of forgoing the cooperation of others is high
enough relative to the rewards of cheating.10 Interestingly, some uncer-
tainty about people’s character and motives can actually help (in the right
circumstances). Even unscrupulous people have an incentive to behave
well if they want to make others believe that they are not really unscrupu-
lous after all. They have an incentive, in other words, to “build a repu-
tation,” even if this reputation is created rather than intrinsic to their
character.11 By contrast, those who are known for certain to be untrust-
worthy have no such incentive. We now have a clearer understanding
of when competition for customers can encourage trustworthy behavior
through the need for reputation, and when formal regulation is likely to
be needed.12
This research has drawn attention to the importance of the expec-
tations of others for inducing trustworthy behavior. In short, cultures
of trust and distrust can come to be self-reinforcing.13 Such ideas have
been explored both theoretically and empirically in recent years, and a
large literature on “social capital” has tried to explain the political and
economic performance of whole societies in terms of the presence or
absence of cultures of trust.14
Work analyzing survey evidence as well as experimental ﬁndings has
established that human motivation diﬀers systematically from the sim-
ple calculating self-interest that has been the dominant working hypoth-
esis of most research in economics. First, experiments by Ernst Fehr and
others have shown clearly that reciprocity can be a powerful inﬂuence on

150 • Epilogue to Parts I and II
behavior even when people do not expect to deal with each other in the
future.15 Secondly, careful comparative analysis of families with step-
parents and biological parents has shown that people behave system-
atically less selﬁshly toward those with whom they share close genetic
ties.16 Such research attempts to control carefully for other variables in
order to isolate the eﬀect of individuals’ motivations, but other stud-
ies look at variability of behavior between societies, in which individual
motivations and expectations about the likely behavior of others play
roles that are diﬃcult to distinguish. There seems to be a good deal
of variation between societies in the extent to which they succeed in
inducing a willingness to trust in the reliability of others.17 This under-
scores the way in which societies can take on a character that emerges
from innumerable individual interactions, without any individual having
intended that result.18 Books that apply this “big picture” theme—the
emergence of order—to understanding the process of economic devel-
opment include (obviously) Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations but also
recent works by Eric Beinhocker, William Bernstein, and Ronald Findlay
and Kevin O’Rourke.19

Prologue to Part III
Economists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, like moralists
of the ancient world, were fond of drawing parallels between human
societies and the colonies of social insects such as ants and bees. Man-
deville’s Fable of the Bees was in a tradition stretching back to Aesop,
carried on by his contemporaries such as La Fontaine in the fable of
the grasshopper and the ant, and inspiring the likes of Woody Allen
even today. In fact, those parallels are misleading: modern human soci-
eties are not like colonies of ants, bees, or termites. As we have seen,
human societies involve the interactions of unrelated strangers instead
of close relatives. Although the earlier belief that there were essentially
no peaceful interactions among unrelated individuals of the same social
insect species has now given way to a more complex picture, in which,
for instance, colonies founded by unrelated queens may coexist,1 social
insects provide us with no parallel to the day-to-day interactions of
strangers in human life.
Nevertheless, the social insects hold a diﬀerent lesson for us, for they
provide striking examples of complex systems behaving in ways that are
no part of the intention (or even the awareness) of any of their partici-
pants. Here is a description of the way termites build a nest:
When they start to build a nest, termites modify their local environ-
ment by making little mud balls and placing them on the substrate;
each mud ball is impregnated with a minute quantity of a particular
pheromone. Termites deposit their mud balls probabilistically, initially
at random. However, the probability of depositing a mud ball at a given
location increases with the sensed presence of other mud balls and the
sensed concentration of pheromone. The ﬁrst few random placements
increase the other termites’ probability of putting their loads at the
same place. By this blind and random game little columns are formed;
the pheromone drifting across from neighbouring columns causes the
tops of the columns to be built with a bias towards the neighbouring
columns, and eventually the tops meet to form arches, the basic build-
ing units.2

Termites are not architects, in other words, for all that their handiwork
may look like architecture. They are merely breeze-sniﬃng mud carters.
Architecture emerges from the combination of all their separate endeav-
ors. Over two centuries ago, Adam Smith had a similarly unelevated view
of the motivations of merchants, and a nevertheless upbeat assessment
of what they might achieve in combination:
As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to
employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct
that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value, every indi-
vidual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society
as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the
public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring
the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only
his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its
produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and
he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote
an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse
for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest
he frequently promotes that of the society more eﬀectually than when
he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done
by those who aﬀected to trade for the public good. It is an aﬀectation,
indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need
be employed in dissuading them from it.3
Although many writers and politicians in later times have tried to recruit
Adam Smith as a drumbeater for various right-wing causes, he certainly
did not think the unintended social consequences of private greed were
invariably beneﬁcial. He famously inveighed against cabals of merchants
whose main purpose in meeting together was to raise prices to the detri-
ment of the public. Emma Rothschild has even suggested that his use
of the metaphor of the “invisible hand” was a sardonic echo of the
“bloody and invisible hand” apostrophized by Shakespeare’s Macbeth to
cover up the crimes he is about to commit.4 But although we shall never
know what Smith would have thought of modern political alignments, we
can be sure that he was fascinated by society’s capacity to display pat-
terns that had never been consciously designed by any of its members.
Some of these patterns might provoke admiration, some might provoke
alarm. Smith constantly cautions his readers against thinking we can use
our admiration or disapproval for someone’s motives as a touchstone
for deciding whether their actions in society should be encouraged or
controlled.

Prologue to Part III • 153
Part II of this book asked how cooperation among strangers is possi-
ble in human society—both how it may have come about and on what
psychological and institutional foundations its credibility rests. Part III
now looks at some of the wider consequences of the human behavior
described in part II, often drawing on historical accounts of the results
of human interactions. Chapter 10 looks at cities, which have been the
crucible of prosperity and creativity in society as well as sinks of pol-
lution, violence, and disease—often all of these things simultaneously.
Great cities are never consciously designed in their entirety, but reﬂect a
mysterious tango between conscious planning and happenstance, with
myriad unplanned interactions between individual city dwellers. These
interactions are known to economists as “externalities,” and are the key
to understanding that elusive spark that diﬀerentiates great cities from
the rest. But externalities, especially those of pollution and disease, are a
major challenge to our capacity for cooperation. Cities have often over-
come their own pollution by collective action, usually with the result that
the pollution is exported to the surrounding countryside. But the world
as a whole cannot do so, for it has no surrounding countryside. It must
ﬁnd ways to care for its own environment by accounting properly for
the costs imposed on that environment by the mass of human activity
of which no one is in overall charge. Chapter 11 looks at one particular
kind of environmental problem, the use of water, as an example of both
the challenges faced by humanity and the way in which our response to
such challenges has historically evolved. Successful responses have typi-
cally involved creating property rights—allocations of responsibility—in
which priorities are ranked by systems of prices, yet it is mysterious how
prices can come to embody all the complex information they would need
to play this role. Chapter 12 therefore looks at price systems and how
they evolve through a process of interaction in markets. Though their
participants do not intend this, markets can often extract and summa-
rize information about what their buyers and sellers believe and want,
information that tells us something very important about how to manage
resources in a world of scarcity.
Yet many important interactions between human beings are not medi-
ated by markets at all, taking place instead in institutions whose compo-
nent activities are more consciously coordinated, notably in ﬁrms. Chap-
ter 12 asks what explains the growth and character of the modern ﬁrm
and what are the relative roles of markets and ﬁrms in the division of
labor. Firms have ﬂourished to a considerable extent as vehicles for the
propagation of knowledge, but also as mechanisms for its control. So

154 • Prologue to Part III
chapter 13 considers how the growth of knowledge in society has arisen
as another manifestation of unplanned interaction between strangers—a
division of labor between generations, in eﬀect. Finally, chapter 14 looks
at those excluded from many of the beneﬁts of modern society: the poor
and the sick, notably the mentally ill and depressed. Is the division of
labor partly to blame, and if so could greater conscious coordination
improve their lot? This forms a natural bridge to part IV, which will con-
sider the nature of collective action—planned responses to the more
alarming unplanned consequences of exchange between strangers.

The City, from Ancient Athens to
Modern Manhattan
The Flair of Great Cities
What makes a great city? And in particular, what gives certain cities at
certain periods a burst of creativity, an innovative ﬂair, an ability to
attract and stimulate people with talent and ideas? Here, too, geogra-
phy and timing are everything; it is as simple and as mysterious as that.
The questions “Why here? Why now? Why not there? Why not then?” have
probably been asked more often about cities than about any other human
phenomenon. While the detailed answers diﬀer, there is something the
most convincing answers all have in common. They point to a quality
in all great cities that transcends the particular intentions of any of the
individual people within them, even the most powerful of such people.
This quality has been given many names: the atmosphere, the buzz, the
networks, the opportunities, the pulse. Whatever else people may try to
plan in a city (from its boulevards to its sewage system), nobody can
realistically hope to plan that. The famous painting of the citta ideale in
Italy’s National Gallery of the Marches has the most harmonious propor-
tions imaginable but an eery absence of life.1 The most famous planned
cities in the world—Brasilia, Chandigarh, Canberra, Milton Keynes—are
bywords for worthiness and lack of spark, and even St. Petersburg has
acquired a faintly exotic reputation only with the patina of time (which
is the sole perspective from which the intrigues of bored aristocrats can
appear creative).2 Modern quantitative research has also suggested that
an important part of the reason that Europe overtook the Arab world
economically in the millennium between the years 800 and 1800 was
that its cities were freer to grow in haphazard, unplanned ways, and less
subject to the demands of a predatory state.3
The historian Peter Hall has tried to understand what the golden ages
of a number of cities have in common—whether these are artistic golden

158 • Chapter 10
ages such as those of Athens under Pericles, Renaissance Florence, or
Hapsburg Vienna, or ages of great industrial innovation such as those
of Victorian Manchester, or Glasgow, or postwar Los Angeles. What he
writes of Athens rings true of many other such golden ages:
Athens in the fourth century bc gained enormously from the personal
and social tensions brought forth by a unique moment of social evolu-
tion: a movement from a static, conservative, aristocratic landowning
society to an urban, trading one open to talent. The old society gave
way in face of the new, but at the same time bequeathed to it many
of its values. We ﬁnd that kind of transitional society at other partic-
ular moments in urban history, and nearly always it is highly creative;
it is the society of Elizabethan London, of nineteenth century Paris, of
Weimar Berlin. … However … creativity of that order is never stable; it
carries within it the seeds of its own destruction … the tension between
the principle of order and the principle of freedom brings something
uniquely wonderful, but it does not last beyond a few golden years, for
the tension will result in victory—usually, though not invariably, for
the forces of change—and with that the wellspring of creativity will dry
up.4
More mundanely, the common ingredients of such creativity are (1)
enough wealth to give those with ideas some hope of ﬁnding patrons,
(2) a substantial immigrant population eager to challenge the established
order, and (3) a total population large enough to contain a critical mass of
talent, but with enough focus in its geography to allow for eﬀective net-
working. These are as true of ancient Athens as of today’s Silicon Valley.
Again and again Hall stresses the importance of networks that bring peo-
ple of talent together, and bring them to the attention of ﬁnancial back-
ers (be they art dealers or venture capitalists), but at the same time allow
them enough stimulation by variety, by the unexpected. He writes, for
instance, of ﬁn-de-siècle Paris: “Since the artists were concentrated geo-
graphically in Montmartre and Montparnasse, since they interchanged
between these centres, since they spent so much time in the cafés and
the cabarets, since they lived and worked together on the river, this was
clearly a highly networked society.”5 But it was just as important that
painters did not only mix with painters; Montmartre “was a rendezvous
of the entire avant-garde of the city: an extraordinary crowd of artists,
poets and writers.”6 The fact that networks mix people together matters
critically, and paradoxically the most sophisticated networks may not
mix people up enough. Networks that are too primitive and ineﬃcient
keep people with ideas from ever meeting each other; but networks that

The City, from Ancient Athens to Modern Manhattan • 159
are too predictable and eﬃcient mean that like may spend too much
time with like, the oﬃcial rules may be too solemnly respected, and
nobody is quite open enough to surprise. After all, the most eﬀective
social networks in French society of the time were the academies and
salons against whose formalism and lack of creativity the impression-
ists and their successors had rebelled.
For the fact is that creativity is almost impossible to aim at directly.
As Hall says, some Marxist theories
go wrong in attributing a quite unnatural degree of deliberate knowing-
ness to the artists [of this period], in ascribing to them a deep—perhaps
even unconscious—desire to undermine the foundations of the bour-
geois order. The artists did no such thing: they painted what they found,
and interpreted it in order to solve problems of a purely artistic nature,
problems that obsessed them. They painted people, and they painted
groups of people together in society, but that was because they were
interested in the play of light on them, or the problems of rendering
their three-dimensionality on a ﬂat piece of canvas.”7
Just as nobody can plan an artistic revolution, nobody quite plans the
networks that make them possible. They are the outcome of the vari-
ous aﬃnities that move ordinary people in their choices of where to live
and work. Every time someone moves, she changes the environment she
leaves and gives a new character to the environment she joins, without
intending or necessarily even being aware of it. And the most innovative
people have always been footloose, restlessly seeking out opportunities
over time and space. Over two centuries ago Adam Smith described the
tendency for artisans and innovators to seek each other out, to congre-
gate in towns and cities. Although proximity forced them to compete, it
also enabled them to learn from each other, and their gains from learn-
ing usually outweighed their losses from competition. But in a predomin-
antly agrarian society, there was a natural limit to this clustering process,
because the bulk of people’s work was tied to the land, which cannot
move. Even restless entrepreneurs cannot move too far from other peo-
ple and their activities. Blacksmiths may have needed other blacksmiths,
but they needed horses even more.
When people did move to cities, the free play of their elective aﬃni-
ties shaped their whole physical space, as the historian Robert Hughes
describes in his account of medieval Barcelona:
All work was done by hand until the end of the eighteenth century, and
all workshops were small. Sometimes they were half on the street. They

160 • Chapter 10
consisted, typically, of one skilled man, the mestre, and an apprentice
or two, the aprenents. These little cells agglomerated. The natural sym-
pathy among workers in the same trade created the intricate, durable
esprit de quartier of Barcelona, as of other medieval cities. Like hangs
out with like; tools need to be shared; if you need to buy a plank of
chestnut or a roll of ribbon, and fast, it makes sense to be near other
carpenters or upholsterers. Dyers had to be near running water; shoe-
makers tended to set up shop near tanners, and vice versa. A client
wanted to be able to comparison shop among various craftsmen in the
same place, rather than zigzag all over the city. It was said, with some
truth, that a blind man could ﬁnd his way around the Barri Gòtic by
smell and sound, knowing where he was by the rasp of saws or the
clink of hammers on the cooper’s bands, the stink of tanning leather,
or the fresh-hay smell of drying esparto grass in the espadrille makers’,
or the fumes of forges. These sounds and smells were street signs, and
the concentration of similar workers in the same places also enabled
them to keep out the competition.8
No one in medieval Barcelona set out to create an esprit de quartier, still
less to set up so poetic and sensual a system of street signs: they did
other things, notably to try and make a living, and the esprit de quartier
emerged as a result of their uncoordinated decisions. Each person who
set up a workshop changed the landscape for others, sometimes for
good, sometimes for ill. Economists have given a name to the usually
unintended eﬀects that individuals have upon each other, and which give
rise to some of the most intriguing, exhilarating, and sometimes disturb-
ing aspects of modern life in mass societies. They are called “externali-
ties,” and they are what tunnel vision leaves out.
Some externalities are ignored by tunnel vision because we don’t care
enough about them, even though we can foresee them. It is absolutely
predictable that traﬃc will become gridlocked at the entrance to large
cities in the morning and evening rush. Each driver knows that she is
holding up the cars behind her, but she does not see why she should
leave her car at home in order to clear the lanes a fraction for the beneﬁt
of everyone else. She cares about the delays others impose on her, but not
enough about those she imposes on others. It is quite certain that if every
factory is given the freedom to pump smoke into the air, the atmosphere
of the city will become unﬁt to breathe, for no one factory owner will wish
to exercise forbearance entirely for the sake of the others. Foreseeing and
curbing such externalities, through cajolery or coercion or both, is the
daily task of political life. It is a task that depends (as we shall see in later
chapters) on making the vision of our political institutions comprehend
what the tunnel vision of each individual citizen neglects.

The City, from Ancient Athens to Modern Manhattan • 161
But there are other kinds of externalities which are neglected because
they are extremely hard for us even to foresee, depending as they do
on the idiosyncrasies and serendipities of the way in which individuals
interact and the mutual spark they provoke. The history of urban plan-
ning is full of examples of cities that have worked hard to remove some
of the most obvious causes of physical blight but have proved incapable
of alleviating boredom, delinquency, and violence. In her book The Death
and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs described how even such
matters as physical safety on the streets were less the result of formal
policing than the unintended by-product of the “seeming disorder” of
the sidewalk, which she likened to a dance:
The stretch of Hudson Street [her home in New York’s Greenwich Vil-
lage] is each day the scene of an intricate sidewalk ballet. I make my
own ﬁrst entrance into it a little after eight when I put out the garbage
can, surely a prosaic occupation, but I enjoy my part, my little clang,
as the droves of junior high school students walk by the center of the
stage dropping candy wrappers. (How do they eat so much candy so
early in the morning?)
While I sweep up the wrappers I watch the other rituals of morning:
Mr. Halpert unlocking the laundry’s handcart from its mooring to a
cellar door, Joe Cornacchia’s son-in-law stacking out the empty crates
from the delicatessen, the barber bringing out his sidewalk folding
chair, Mr. Goldstein arranging the coils of wire which proclaim his hard-
ware store is open, the wife of the tenement’s superintendent deposit-
ing her chunky three-year-old with a toy mandolin on the stoop, the
vantage point from which he is learning the English his mother can-
not speak. Now the primary children, heading for St. Luke’s, dribble
through to the south; the children for St. Veronica’s cross, heading to
the west, and the children for P.S. 41, heading toward the east. Two new
entrances are being made from the wings: well-dressed and even ele-
gant women and men with briefcases emerge from doorways and side
streets. Most of these are heading for the buses and subways, but some
hover on the curbs, stopping taxis which have miraculously appeared
at the right moment, for the taxis are part of a wider morning ritual:
having dropped passengers from midtown in the downtown ﬁnancial
district, they are now bringing downtowners up to midtown. Simultane-
ously, numbers of women in housedresses have emerged and as they
crisscross with one another they pause for quick conversations that
sound with either laughter or joint indignation, never, it seems, any-
thing between. It is time for me to hurry to work too, and I exchange my
ritual farewell with Mr. Lofaro, the short, thick-bodied, white-aproned
fruit man who stands outside his doorway a little up the street, his arms
folded, his feet planted, looking solid as earth itself. We nod, we each
glance quickly up and down the street, then look back to each other

162 • Chapter 10
and smile. We have done this many a morning for more than ten years,
and we both know what it means: All is well.9
Though the rhythms of her description might hint otherwise, Jacobs’s
account is not some re-creation of mythical village life transplanted to
an urban context, complete with urban counterparts to the blacksmith
and the priest. No: cities are diﬀerent from villages and small towns
precisely because the streets are mostly full of strangers. But even among
strangers there can be trust, and even people who know each other need
trust to help them deal with the many strangers who surround them.
And, as Jacobs reminds us:
the trust of a city street is formed over time from many, many little pub-
lic sidewalk contacts. It grows out of people stopping by at the bar for a
beer, getting advice from the grocer and giving advice to the newsstand
man, comparing opinions with other customers at the bakery and nod-
ding hello to the two boys drinking pop on the stoop, eyeing the girls
while waiting to be called for dinner, admonishing the children, hearing
about a job from the hardware man and borrowing a dollar from the
druggist, admiring the new baby and sympathizing over the way a coat
faded. Customs vary: in some neighborhoods people compare notes on
their dogs; in others they compare notes on their landlords. Most of it
is ostensibly utterly trivial, but the sum is not trivial at all.10
Stench and Waste
Cities are full of externalities, and they are not all so stimulating to cre-
ativity, nor so poetic, as the street signs in the form of sounds and smells
described by Robert Hughes. Medieval Barcelona, like all large cities of
the period, was periodically racked by epidemics of cholera or plague.
Quattrocento Florence at its most spectacular had just endured an attack
of plague that reduced its population by over a third.11 Nobody intended
to pass the bacillus on to others. No one even knew what caused such epi-
demics until well into the nineteenth century. One of the most famous
maps of London is that drawn by the physician Dr. John Snow in the
cholera epidemic of 1854, who noted the way cases of infection were
geographically clustered around a particular water pump in Soho. His
ﬁndings led the authorities to close the pump, thereby perhaps hasten-
ing the end of the epidemic, though not until it had claimed over ﬁve
hundred lives.12
The disposal of sewage has been a problem for humanity ever since the
beginning of agriculture and a settled lifestyle some ten thousand years

The City, from Ancient Athens to Modern Manhattan • 163
ago. Inadequate solutions to the problem meant that large cities became
sinks of disease, even though they were also the crucible of creativity in
their societies. In early eighteenth-century London between 35 and 40
per cent of infants died in the ﬁrst year of life, a rate well above that of
the surrounding countryside and one that would be utterly intolerable
to us today. Stench and ﬁlth were facts of life in large cities, and it was
not until the nineteenth century and the ﬁrst large-scale sewage works
that a clean urban environment came to be considered something to
which citizens could reasonably aspire. Ancient Athens was remarkable
for the contrast between the grandeur of the Acropolis and the squalor
of its residential streets, but only by a very modern eye would the squalor
even have been noticed.
Jorge Luis Borges, in his essay “The Argentine Writer and Tradition,”
quoted Edward Gibbon to the eﬀect that “in the Arab book par excellence,
the Koran, there are no camels; I believe that if there were ever any doubt
as to the authenticity of the Koran, this lack of camels would suﬃce to
prove that it is Arab. It was written by Mohammed, and Mohammed, as
an Arab, had no reason to know that camels were particularly Arab; they
were, for him, a part of reality, and he had no reason to single them out,
while the ﬁrst thing a forger, or tourist, or an Arab nationalist would do
is bring on the camels.”13 As it happens, Borges (and Gibbon) were wrong
about camels, which appear frequently in the Koran. But it is certainly
rare when reading Balzac or Dickens or any of the other contemporary
ﬁctional chroniclers of life in the great ﬁlthy cities of the past to ﬁnd any
reference to their revolting smell. This is not because smell was unimpor-
tant to city dwellers; it was an object of everyday comment and interest,
fascination, even scientiﬁc inquiry (as Alain Corbin’s book The Foul and
the Fragrant has evocatively described).14 But when novelists wanted to
open their readers’ sensibilities, they would focus on aspects of city life
people did not notice or properly appreciate, rather than those aspects
everyone knew about. To feel the full stench of eighteenth-century Paris
invade our nostrils, we must turn to a modern writer, Patrick Süskind:
In the period of which we speak, there reigned in the cities a stench
barely conceivable to us modern men and women. The streets stank
of manure, the courtyards of urine, the stairwells stank of moldering
wood and rat droppings, the kitchens of spoiled cabbage and mutton
fat; the unaired parlors stank of stale dust, the bedrooms of greasy
sheets, damp featherbeds, and the pungently sweet aroma of chamber
pots. The stench of sulfur rose from the chimneys, the stench of caustic
lyes from the tanneries, and from the slaughterhouses came the stench

164 • Chapter 10
of congealed blood. People stank of sweat and unwashed clothes; from
their mouths came the stench of rotting teeth, from their bellies that
of onions, and from their bodies, if they were no longer very young,
came the stench of rancid cheese and sour milk and tumorous disease.
The rivers stank, the marketplaces stank, the churches stank, it stank
beneath the bridges and in the palaces. The peasant stank as did the
priest, the apprentice stank as did his master’s wife, the whole of the
aristocracy stank, even the king himself stank, stank as a rank lion, and
the queen like an old goat, summer and winter. For in the eighteenth
century there was nothing to hinder the bacteria busy at decomposition,
and so there was no human activity, either constructive or destructive,
no manifestation of germinating or decaying life that was not accompa-
nied by stench. And of course the stench was foulest in Paris, for Paris
was the largest city of France.15
Smell, like some kinds of disease, traveled on the air, and thereby nar-
rowed the distance between rich and poor, a distance that by more con-
ventional measures, such as income, was much larger than it is today.
Until the late eighteenth century, the children of the rich were as vulnera-
ble to disease as the children of the poor: externalities were no respecters
of wealth or class.16 In the modern world, the rich are much less vulnera-
ble to disease than the poor, virtually everywhere on the planet. The rea-
son for this change is that there is a better understanding of the nature
of disease transmission and in most societies a greater political willing-
ness to organize city life to take this understanding into account. Using
this knowledge, the rich have found ways to distance themselves from
the detritus of their lifestyle, whether this involves sending the garbage
away or removing themselves to the suburbs. In every city in the world,
the rich export their waste to a safe distance while the poor remain sur-
rounded by it. As one environmental writer has pointed out, “in poor
cities and especially their poor neighborhoods, environmental problems
tend to stay close to home. Inadequate household water supplies are typ-
ically more critical to people’s wellbeing than contaminated waterways.
Air pollution in the kitchen is often far worse than outdoors.”17
In the process of cleaning up their cities, the world’s aﬄuent have
nevertheless, on the whole, improved the environment of the poor. They
have done so largely out of self-interest, but the achievement is no less
valuable for that. Even in some of the world’s poorest countries, newborn
children have a much better chance of surviving the ﬁrst year of life than
did any children anywhere a century ago. Italy on the eve of World War II
had a rate of infant mortality that was as high as Uganda’s is today,
even though by any other standard Italy was much more prosperous

The City, from Ancient Athens to Modern Manhattan • 165
than Uganda has yet become. This worldwide improvement has been
due partly to the spread of knowledge about what individuals can do
to avoid disease: boiling water, using rehydration solution in cases of
diarrhea, and so on. Partly it has been due to immunization and pub-
lic health campaigns against such diseases as smallpox, malaria, and
tuberculosis, though we are starting to realize that our spectacular early
victories against these diseases will not be permanent. Organisms that
survive complete extinction evolve resistance to the drugs we use against
them. We shall need to go on ﬁnding more and more sophisticated drugs
against the bacteria and viruses of the natural world, in an evolutionary
guerrilla war that we can hope to contain but never to win.
To a considerable extent, though, the improvement in children’s sur-
vival prospects has been due to initiatives in the removal and treatment
of urban waste. The aﬄuent and politically well-connected have realized
that their urban environment need not be as dirty and dangerous as was
universally accepted in the past. They have organized to demand the
construction of sewage systems so that human excreta are no longer
dumped straight into the river. They have found various ways to dis-
pose of ordinary household waste, particularly the skins and packages,
organic and inorganic, in which their food and other consumables are
wrapped. Nowadays all cities of any size undergo a nightly transfor-
mation that begins no later than the hour before dawn, but diﬀerent
cities across the world have diﬀerent methods. Where there is poverty
of resources or public organization, as in Calcutta, the transformation is
brought about by the initiative of individual rag-pickers, tinkers, dung-
gatherers, paper-collectors, dogs, cows, and recyclers of anything and
everything, who emerge as soon as the twilight permits to sort through
last night’s discards of the reveling rich.
You might think from this example that one man’s externalities are
always another man’s opportunities, so that the eternal opportunism of
someone’s tunnel vision might be relied upon to clear up what another
person’s tunnel vision ignores. But as we know from our own history,
such opportunism was the fruit of misery: only a society with desperately
poor and marginalized people could leave its waste disposal entirely to
individual initiative. In Victorian London, the gatherers of “pure”—dog
shit sold for curing leather—were forced by increasing competition to
search earlier and harder each morning, until the weakest and oldest
among them dropped out of the contest altogether. In his classic study
London Labour and the London Poor, published in 1861, Henry Mayhew
distinguished them from “bone-grubbers and rag-gatherers, who are,

166 • Chapter 10
indeed, the same individuals … the cigar-end and old wood collectors
… the dredgermen, the mud-larks and the sewer-hunters … the dust-
men and nightmen, the sweeps and the scavengers.”18 As his classiﬁ-
cation suggests, there were respects in which the division of labor in
Victorian Britain was much more elaborate than it is today, and May-
hew was its ideal chronicler (he was nothing if not meticulous, spending
several pages discussing the merits of rival calculations before conclud-
ing that the amount of horse dung dropped in the whole of London
must lie between seven hundred and a thousand tons per day). May-
hew interviewed “a poor old woman resembling a bundle of rags and
ﬁlth stretched on some dirty straw in the corner of [her] apartment.” He
noted that “to my astonishment I found this wretched creature to be, to a
certain extent, a ‘superior’ woman; she could read and write well, spoke
correctly, and appeared to have been a person of natural good sense,
though broken up with age, want and inﬁrmity.” She described to him
the trials of “pure” gathering in terms that show a very precise grasp of
the laws of supply and demand:
If we only gathered a pail-full in the day, we could live very well; but
we could do much more than that, for there wasn’t near so many at the
business then, and the Pure was easier to be had. For my part I can’t tell
where all the creatures have come from of late years; the world seems
growing worse and worse every day. They have pulled down the price of
Pure, that’s certain; but the poor things must do something, they can’t
starve while there’s anything to be got. Why, no later than six or seven
years ago, it was as high as 3s.6d. and 4s. a pail-full, and a ready sale
for as much of it as you could get; but now you can only get 1s. and in
some places 1s.2d. a pail-full; and, as I said before, there are so many at
it, that there is not much left for a poor old creature like me to ﬁnd.19
Cities that relied on individual initiative alone to dispose of waste have
paid a large human cost.
Civic Action and the Urban Environment
Today in rich societies, fortunately, not everything is left to individual
initiative. There is teamwork, usually organized by the state but often
employing immigrants who are glad of the work. A sight modern visi-
tors to Florence rarely encounter is the teams of silent sweepers—mainly
Ethiopian or Somali—who clean away the Renaissance extravagance of
the ﬁlth that has accumulated in the city’s streets by about 4 a.m. (I
myself have seen them only through a travel-planning failure that left me

The City, from Ancient Athens to Modern Manhattan • 167
without a hotel.) In Mexico City the neighborhoods are divided up among
private, often criminal, gangs, who defend their territory with ﬁerce
and sometimes violent determination, since amid the garbage there are
many dispersed items of value, individually unremarkable but together
amounting to gold. Waste disposal can be a proﬁtable business. May-
hew himself commented of Victorian London that “Were the collection
of mud and dust carried on by a number of distinct individuals—that
is to say, were each individual dustman and scavenger to collect on his
own account, there is no doubt that no one man could amass a fortune
by such means—while if the collection of bones and rags and even dogs’-
dung were carried on ‘in the large way,’ that is to say, by a number of
individual collectors working for one ‘head man,’ even the picking up
of the most abject refuse of the metropolis might become the source of
great riches.”
But it is also a business that thrives by storing up trouble for the future.
It is characteristic of increasing prosperity that people export their pol-
lution to more distant places. The distances to which these eﬀects can
be displaced are limited by the size of the earth, so the policy, adopted
by today’s prosperous countries, of exporting pollution will no longer be
feasible for the more prosperous world of tomorrow.
The inescapable fact is that the comfortable lifestyle to which modern
citizens rightly aspire creates waste. And there are only two things that
can be done with waste. One is to transform it into something harmless
or even beneﬁcial, as happens when we ask our allies among the bacteria
to break down our excreta into compounds that add to the fertility of the
soil, or when scavengers devote their energies to ﬁnding those discarded
items that have alternative uses. The other solution is to send the waste
away to a place where we hope to be able to ignore it for the foreseeable
future (ecologists call such places “sinks”). But as humanity’s exploita-
tion of the planet and its resources has expanded during the course of
the last century, we have come to realize that there are fewer and fewer
places in which our waste may be safely ignored. Until the 1950s and the
great urban smogs of London and other large industrial cities, we had
treated the atmosphere as a sink, and the discovery that soot particles
did not travel far but clung to the city’s mantle produced a systematic
and largely successful political reaction: the air of London, Paris, and
New York really is much cleaner today than it was ﬁfty years ago. We
have since come to realize that carbon dioxide and chloroﬂuorocarbons
(the emissions that cause global warming and deplete the ozone layer)
are no less toxic for acting much more slowly and much further away.

168 • Chapter 10
Sometimes our eﬀorts at recycling even add to the pressure on our atmo-
spheric sinks, as when we use energy to melt glass bottles and thereby
preserve our backyards at the price of adding yet more carbon dioxide
to the air.
As an alternative to the organization of collective life to make our
waste less dangerous (either by breaking it down organically or by remov-
ing it to a “safe” distance), the history of humanity has shown us only
one solution. This is a solution from biology, and a drastic one at that,
namely, the evolution of resistance. As human beings crowded together
into villages, towns, and cities, only those who had some resistance to
the toxic environment would survive into fertile adulthood and transmit
that resistance to the next generation. In his book Guns, Germs and Steel,
Jared Diamond has sought to explain one of the most striking features
of the encounter between European settlers and Native Americans in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries: brutal as the Europeans were, the
numbers of Native Americans they killed were dwarfed by the number
who died of European diseases to which they had no immunity.20 Euro-
peans in turn faced some new American diseases, but far fewer of them
died as a result. The reason, suggests Diamond, is that livestock rearing
was much more common in the agriculture of Europe, so that Europeans
had been used for several millennia to living among cattle, sheep, pigs,
and horses, and to sharing their germs (as Americans had not). Some-
thing similar must have been true of the germs human beings received
from each other, and from rats. The terrible death toll of medieval cities
was part of a process that for millennia had been making European citi-
zens the hardy carriers of germs that would prove more fatal to Native
Americans than any deliberate weaponry.
As Diamond’s evidence about livestock has shown us, it is not only
in cities that human beings transmit externalities to each other. Some
of the world’s great manmade environmental crises have taken place in
rural areas many miles from the cities, like the drying up of the Aral
Sea described in chapter 2. The environmental economists Gary Libecap
and Zeynep Hansen have written about another manmade disaster, the
Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s in the American Great Plains, described
vividly by John Steinbeck in The Grapes of Wrath: “In the morning the
dust hung like fog, and the sun was as red as ripe new blood. All day the
dust sifted down from the sky, and the next day it sifted down. An even
blanket covered the earth. It settled on the corn, piled up on the tops of
the fence posts, piled up on the wires; it settled on roofs, blanketed the
weeds and trees.”21 Libecap and Hansen have shown how the crisis came

The City, from Ancient Athens to Modern Manhattan • 169
about as a result of the division of land on the plains into plots that were
too small to be economically viable. The result was that farmers used
intensive cultivation practices that contributed to severe wind erosion,
failed to place land into fallow, and could not aﬀord to diversify into
pasture. Over two hundred thousand farms in the Great Plains states had
done what they reasonably could to survive. None of them had wanted
to contribute to soil erosion, and none of them individually could have
halted the plowing up of native grasses and the reduction in the size of
soil particles from intensive cultivation that made the land so vulnerable
to the wind once drought set in during the early 1930s. But the result was
devastating: “one dust storm in May 1934 started in Montana and spread
south, carrying some 350 million tons of soil towards the east Coast.
During a storm of February 7, 1937, 34.2 tons of soil fell per square mile
at Ames, Iowa, 14.9 tons at Marquette, Michigan, and 10 tons across
the continent in New Hampshire. [It was] estimated that in 1935 alone
850 million tons of topsoil had blown away from 4.3 million acres in the
southern plains.” The one thing which could have helped, a consolidation
of farms into larger units that could aﬀord to use more sound ecological
practices, was resisted by local politicians out of a combined sentimental
attachment to the idea of the small family farm and fear of the likely loss
of voting population. When such consolidation did eventually occur, the
plains went through successive droughts in the 1950s and 1970s without
anything like the same catastrophic environmental consequences.
These episodes, like the terrible epidemics in medieval Europe, show
us what happens when our political institutions fail to meet the toxic
challenge of our increasingly aﬄuent lifestyle. From one point of view,
our history is encouraging, because those political institutions have
eventually risen to each new environmental challenge: the continuously
falling toll of infant mortality throughout the world is a convincing
response to those pessimists who believe that there is never any progress
in history. Even ancient Athens, with its poky houses and smelly streets,
could oﬀer its (adult, male, free) inhabitants the inspiration of the Acrop-
olis, constructed at enormous expense by concerted political action. In
the late nineteenth century, cities such as London, Paris, and Berlin could
systematically build subways, sewers, and water systems that allowed
vaster populations than ever before to live together without choking on
their own waste.
From another point of view, though, our history is full of warnings:
our political institutions have always responded sluggishly, under pres-
sure from terrible catastrophes, and with a bias toward threats that are

170 • Chapter 10
immediate, visible, and close to home. As the rich and politically pow-
erful become better informed and more organized, those threats have
been gradually better managed. The foreseeable externalities have been
progressively tamed. But threats that are yet to come, invisible, unpre-
dictable, and faraway remain unaddressed. And a larger, more aﬄuent,
and industrially more inventive world population may well create such
threats faster than the tunnel vision of its individual members will allow
them to respond.
Governing Cities
Raymond Chandler once commented on the power and reach of crim-
inal organizations by writing that in the modern world “gangsters can
rule nations and can almost rule cities.”22 His remark is an acknowl-
edgment that even those with apparently great power—derived from
their ability to inﬂict unchallenged violence—ﬁnd the sheer complexity
of cities impossible to organize to their satisfaction. The inhabitants of
cities interact with each other in ways that no one has foreseen, not even
themselves. Conservative authorities—aristocracies, churches, guilds—
have always been wary of cities, seeing them as decadent places not only
because decadent people choose to live there but also because people’s
behavior changes when they arrive in the city. In the city, individuals
experiment and invent; they refashion everything from their political
ideologies, their relationships with their parents, their sexuality, and the
music that moves them, to the industrial processes with which they work.
Others have admired cities for just that reason, and for writers such as
Balzac the corruption and cynicism of the city—the ease with which peo-
ple can change their skin—are the very features that give it energy and
life.
If the world as a whole were really becoming a vast city, the history
of existing cities would be a cause for great optimism about the future
of mankind. Cities have often been violent, pestilential, polluted, and
physically repulsive, but they have also seen some of the most spectac-
ular capacities for human ingenuity, not only in technological invention
but also in political and social organization. Unlike some nation-states
and some civilizations, cities have not destroyed themselves. But that
is because cities have a safety valve in the natural environment that
surrounds them. Cities have been able to live oﬀthe resources of their
hinterland—its food, its water, its energy—and export their waste to it in
turn. But for all the talk of information technology bringing the whole of

The City, from Ancient Athens to Modern Manhattan • 171
humanity face to face in one vast neighborhood, the world as a whole is
not a city, for the simple reason that it has no hinterland. It must ﬁnd its
own resources, and it must dispose of its own waste. In order to do so,
it must start to account properly for them both. For much of human his-
tory, cities have undervalued the resources they used and trivialized the
cost of the waste they created. They have beneﬁted from tunnel vision
much more than they have been harmed. So chapter 11 looks at one such
resource and explores what would be meant by accounting properly for
its use. The resource is one that many people in aﬄuent urban societies
think of as free. It is water.

Water: Commodity or Social Institution?
The Many Meanings of Water
What would it mean to account properly for water as a valuable resource?
To answer that question we need ﬁrst to understand why we value water
and what we value about it. Answers to this question are many, varied,
and paradoxical. The government of Mexico spends around 400 million
dollars per year providing drinking water to its population, of whom
nearly half in rural areas still have no access to safe sources of supply.
This is one-ﬁfth of what consumers in France (which has a population
three-quarters the size of Mexico’s) spend per year on bottled mineral
and spring water, which (as magazine or television advertisements con-
ﬁrm) is primarily marketed as beneﬁcial to health.1 However, French tap
water is of excellent quality and universally available, so the principal
beneﬁt to health from drinking bottled water is that it may induce people
to drink less alcohol. This diﬀerence can hardly mean that Mexicans are
less concerned with health: a child born in Mexico City is more likely to
be vaccinated than a similar child in a large American city. Yet although
water from a standpipe in Mexico City is for most purposes chemically
identical to water from a spring in the Massif Central, and although both
answer to a deep human concern for health, as economic commodities
they could hardly be more diﬀerent.
There is widespread agreement that the world in the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury will face major health, security, or economic crises2 if nations are
not willing to undertake what the Dublin International Conference on
Water and the Environment called the management of water “as an eco-
nomic good,” a concept that is also at the heart of the policies now advo-
cated by the World Bank. But what does this mean? What kind of eco-
nomic good is water? The more we examine the evidence the more we
see that water is not one kind of good, but many. These goods diﬀer
along physical and biological dimensions, but not only along these: they
diﬀer also in the way that human societies construct and evaluate them.

Water: Commodity or Social Institution? • 173
What we shall see in this chapter is that water means such widely
diﬀerent things to diﬀerent people in diﬀerent circumstances—a life-
giver to some, a threat to others, an inspiration for poetry to some, a
reason for concentrating political power to yet others—that it seems the
last thing in the world one could ever realistically value by something
as apparently simple and one-dimensional as a price. And yet, precisely
for that reason, water needs to be properly accounted for as a scarce
resource—in a word, “priced.” For the very complexity of water’s appeal
to diﬀerent users will make it impossible for them to agree how to share
it, unless they focus on the one thing that prevents them from having
as much of it as they would like: its scarcity. And accounting for water
means measuring not how important, beautiful, or poetic it is, but simply
how scarce it is in the places that people need it.
Scarcity is the most fundamental economic characteristic of any good;
indeed, the canonical deﬁnition of economics itself is “the study of the
allocation of scarce resources among competing ends.”3 Water is scarce
in many parts of the world, relative to the physiological needs of the
inhabitants of those regions. Around 1,250 cubic meters of water per
person are required every year for the supply of habitats and the pro-
duction of subsistence crops, without counting the amounts necessary
for industry or cash crops. About one-third of the world’s population
lives in countries subject to moderate-to-high water stress, where more
than 600 people share every million cubic meters of water available annu-
ally, and the proportion of the world’s population living in conditions of
water stress or worse has been predicted by one UN estimate to grow
from 8 per cent in the year 2000 to well over 50 per cent in 2025.4 In
other circumstances and in other parts of the world, water can be in
excess: ﬂoods in Bangladesh or in China regularly claim more lives than
do droughts. There are also regions of the world in a happily interme-
diate position, with water in abundance, neither scarce nor in excess.
Our entire attitude toward water changes with its scarcity: water in con-
ditions of scarcity is life-giving, but in excess it is life-threatening, one
of the most terrifying of natural forces. The consciousness of having
escaped from the threat of the sea was so central to the thought of the
citizens of the early Dutch Republic that they invented a gruesome pun-
ishment, the “drowning cell,” for those convicted of unwillingness to
work: “They are tethered like asses and are put in a cellar that is ﬁlled
with water so that they must partly empty it by pumping if they do not
wish to drown.”5

174 • Chapter 11
The value of water depends, in other words, on whether it is physi-
cally located where we want it to be, and in the right quantity. Royce
Hanson has written that “taken as a whole, the United States has plenty
of water, now and for the future. The problem is, of course, that no-
one lives in the United States as a whole.”6 This is no less true for the
world as a whole: there are on average far more freshwater resources per
head of the world’s population than the most proﬂigate use could ever
require, but they are not where they are needed. Entire empires have been
founded on the need to organize the movement of water from where it is
naturally found to where it is required for human life—from where it is
abundant to where it is scarce. This is the consequence of an important
technological fact: the cost of water to its users is dominated by the cost
of transporting, storing, and delivering it. The technology of doing so
is subject to major economies of scale, meaning that the costs of trans-
porting any given amount of water are lower if it is being transported
in large quantities. This means that the control of water has historically
tended to be a major monopoly—indeed, as the jargon has it, a “natural”
monopoly (one due to the inherent character of technology rather than
to artiﬁcial restrictions on trade). Water has always been controlled by
the politically and militarily powerful rather than by merchants, and in
our day that makes it almost everywhere the prerogative of states more
than of private markets.
Water’s value depends also, and more subtly, upon its quality. Water is
virtually never pure, and its biological or chemical contents can destroy
us. Diarrhea from water-borne diseases alone was estimated in 2004
to kill 1.8 million people in the world every year, equivalent to twelve
jumbo-jet crashes per day.7 The World Health Organization reported in
2008 that there were 247 million annual cases of malaria (spread by
mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water), some 880,000 of which were
fatal.8 Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, infects many millions every
year, mostly in Africa. There were 178,000 reported cases of cholera in
2007.9
For millions of the world’s inhabitants, therefore, even when water is
in abundant quantity, water quality is scarce. Yet organic contents are
in the long run less to be feared as pollutants of water than inorganic
chemicals. There is a natural hydrological cycle, in which the organic
contents of water are broken down by the processes of biological decay
and an equilibrium established in which the stock of water is renewed.
But chemical pollutants threaten this cycle, since many of them are sta-
ble over very long periods of time. Indeed, stability is in many respects

Water: Commodity or Social Institution? • 175
a highly desirable quality of industrial and agricultural chemicals, since
otherwise they would degrade into inert components and cease to per-
form the functions for which they have been synthesized. Much eﬀort,
therefore, is devoted in the world’s laboratories to building longevity
into chemical design, an eﬀort typical of tunnel vision, since it takes no
account of the consequences of this longevity for the natural environ-
ment.
When threatened by suﬃciently persistent chemicals, water ceases to
be a renewable resource and becomes a nonrenewable one. It is possi-
ble to make a comeback from the destruction of water quality by inor-
ganic chemicals only in certain environments, such as rivers (from which
today’s stock of pollutants can be washed out to sea, where they become
someone else’s problem). And even here the cost can be great, as shown
by the many billions of dollars spent on cleaning up the Rhine. The Rhine
Action Plan, agreed to in the mid 1980s, set as its main goal the return of
salmon and other higher aquatic species to the Rhine; since the annual
salmon catch was around a quarter of a million ﬁsh in the late nineteenth
century, this implies that the more than half a billion dollars spent by
one ﬁrm (BASF) alone in 1991 was equivalent to an implicit valuation
of over two thousand dollars per ﬁsh.10 But the impressive technical
success of the plan shows at least that rivers can recover from chemi-
cal pollution. Groundwater sources can be more vulnerable to pollution
and respond more slowly to decontamination eﬀorts. Concentrations of
the pesticide DDT in ﬁsh, for example, have shown impressive improve-
ments since the danger from DDT was ﬁrst identiﬁed in the 1960s. But
a study by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2006 showed that a majority of
groundwater sources in U.S. urban areas contained detectable levels of
other pesticides, and in around one source in twenty these were at levels
potentially dangerous to human health.11
Another of the highly variable physical characteristics of water is the
extent to which it impedes or facilitates movement. Water can be a bar-
rier: the English Channel preserved the British Isles from invasion dur-
ing World War II (as during many earlier conﬂicts), and even today many
political frontiers are marked by rivers. This explains why so many river
basins (which are natural economic units) have to be managed by nego-
tiations between a number of sovereign political authorities. But water
can also be a carrier, of good things or bad. Rivers, canals, and seas have
supported the world’s most eﬃcient long-distance trade routes, and the
great overland routes, such as the Silk Road, ﬂourished only where water-
borne alternatives were too lengthy or dangerous. Inland seas such as

176 • Chapter 11
the Mediterranean and the Black Sea have been the hub of the world’s
most dynamic civilizations.12 But the same water that brought prosper-
ity has also brought disease: rats bearing the Black Death traveled by
ship to Europe, and the great cholera epidemics were transmitted by
contaminated drinking water.
The very invisibility of the dangers transmitted by water means that
our perception of them is prone to powerful cultural manipulation. The
ideological foundation of the Hindu caste system is the fear of pollu-
tion transmitted by members of lower castes, and water is the most
potent symbol of such transmission: even today millions of Hindus will
not accept water unless oﬀered by members of their own caste.13 In
the northeast and far west of the United States, recreational activities
involving bodily contact with the water have traditionally been forbid-
den on domestic water supply reservoirs (in spite of the absence of any
objective health risk), because water managers and public opinion view
such activities as contaminating; in the remainder of the country, such
activities are not only allowed but encouraged.14 Nuclear and industrial
pollution aﬀecting our water has a peculiarly intimate and threatening
contact with us, as the old protest song reminds us: “What have they
done to the rain?”
It is precisely this intimacy that explains our ambivalence toward
water. The change in sexual behavior and conventions in industrialized
countries since World War II may have been accelerated by the Pill, but
enhanced opportunities for personal hygiene have also been a major fac-
tor: aristocracies have always treated sex as a recreation and an art, with
or without contraception, but only with widespread indoor plumbing has
sexuality been democratized. The spread of AIDS means water has come
to seem menacing as well as liberating: bodily ﬂuids are the vector, and
the San Francisco bathhouses are the symbol of the epidemic’s arrival.
But water as the universal solvent has always had powerful and ambiva-
lent poetic force. W. H. Auden begins his melancholy tribute “In Praise
of Limestone” with the words:
If it form the one landscape that we the inconstant ones
Are consistently homesick for, this is chieﬂy
Because it dissolves in water. Mark these rounded slopes
With their surface fragrance of thyme and beneath
A secret system of caves and conduits.15
Water in the poem comes to symbolize balance and familiarity (for it
creates landscapes “of short distances and deﬁnite places”), but also the

Water: Commodity or Social Institution? • 177
mysterious (like music it “can be made anywhere, is invisible and does
not smell”). And of course it stands as well for death, the dissolution of
life. Its omnipresence gives it a multitude of symbolic properties.
In some ways our awareness of water has increased as societies have
grown richer, partly because of its greater domestic availability but also
because education brings us knowledge of its invisible properties. Water
has always had ambivalent chemical functions—sometimes as a catalyst,
sometimes as an extinguisher—but we have long known about the latter,
whereas we are learning ever more about the former. Opinion poll evi-
dence suggests a systematic diﬀerence in perception of water issues in
rich and poor countries.16 Not only are environmental issues generally
ranked as much more important in relation to other matters of politi-
cal concern in rich countries, but water quality typically ranks as one
of the top two environmental issues cited there by poll respondents. In
poorer countries, water quality often appears far down the list: in a 1990
opinion poll in Lima (Peru), pollution of drinking water and pollution of
rivers and seas were each cited by a mere 1 per cent of respondents as
the main environmental problem facing the country, well behind “rub-
bish in streets and public places” (42 per cent), air pollution from vehicle
exhausts (30 per cent), and “air pollution from power plants and indus-
try” (12 per cent). Paradoxically, access to adequate quantities of water
is the concrete concern of the poor, even though water quality is a much
greater objective threat to the poor than to the rich. Only the literal invis-
ibility of water quality can explain this.
So, to sum up, water has a vast range of meanings, uses, and values—
in the abstract or ethical sense of the term “values.” Fortunately, though,
two strangers who exchange water do not need to engage with the mean-
ings, uses, and values each imputes to the good they are exchanging. All
they need to do is agree on a price: how much water against how much
of something else. In this lies the simplicity of market exchange: what
matters is the scarcity of water for each party, relative to the scarcity of
anything else they may want.
Scarcity and Property Rights
But the scarcity of water is not determined just by its physical geography.
It depends also on the kinds of property rights that can be vested in it.
For water that someone can drink but is not allowed to pump through a
pipe will, eﬀectively, be more scarce than water that people are allowed
to transport. To put it another way, the right to transport water to where

178 • Chapter 11
it is needed can relax to some degree the constraint imposed on us by
water’s natural scarcity in the place where it is needed, and that is why
the property right is valuable. Property rights are, above all, rules that
determine how water may be used, and water use is a social institution
whose rules we collectively invent. Throughout the world, we create such
rules in many ways, constrained both by the physical scarcity of the
water and by the direction and nature of the interactions between its
diﬀerent users. Rules are worth making only if we can aﬀord the expense
of enforcing them. So water is sometimes a purely private good, as when
it is bottled for drinking. What it means for it to be a private good is
that its owner must be able to prevent others from having access to
it. Its high weight and volume relative to its value make this unusual:
only when users are willing to pay enough to make it worth the expense
of physically sealing it from the outside world, and when nobody else
beneﬁts or suﬀers from the use made of it, is water strictly a private
good. At the other extreme, some water resources are available to all
users, like the world’s oceans, where the prohibitive cost of enforcing
rules of access beyond territorial waters means there are, eﬀectively,
no rules. Such resources are sometimes called public goods, and they
have two deﬁning characteristics: ﬁrst, that no one can be excluded from
access to them, and, second, that one person’s access to them does not
appreciably diminish the use that others can make of them.
In between the extreme cases of private and public goods lie two types
of property that include most of the interesting cases. Water is some-
times common property, when a whole community has collective juris-
diction over its use. Each member of the community is potentially in a
position to inﬂict externalities on the others, whether by polluting the
resource or simply by failing to take account of the reduced amounts
left for other users. Communal irrigation systems, inshore ﬁsheries, and
many aquifers are of this kind. Alternatively, water use may be charac-
terized by externalities that go in only one direction, such as when one
group of users has control, while another group is aﬀected signiﬁcantly
by the ﬁrst group’s use but has no formal rights it could exercise to
restrain that use and must rely on persuasion. The relationship between
upstream and downstream countries along an international river is the
most striking example of such a system. It is now becoming fashionable
to see the greatest threats to the world’s security in the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury as coming from “water wars,” triggered by the tensions between
such upstream and downstream users and by the inadequacy of interna-
tional legal and arbitration mechanisms to deal with them.17 Outbreaks

Water: Commodity or Social Institution? • 179
of violence in areas of severe water shortage such as Darfur, as well as
continuing tensions over pressure on scarce water in Israel and Palestine,
only indicate how catastrophically our societies may respond if water
shortages become more widespread in future decades.
The nature of property rights in water will be inﬂuenced by how eas-
ily some users are able to exclude others from access. But exclusion is
not an all-or-nothing matter: someone who can be prevented physically
from withdrawing water from an aquifer for use may still be capable
of polluting the source. And again, even if private rights to the water
itself cannot be established, somebody may have clearly deﬁned rights
to something in the water, such as ﬁsh or mineral deposits. This means
that we should expect rules that adequately govern all the uses we may
make of water to be extremely sophisticated, continuously evolving as
technological and other circumstances change, and highly sensitive to
the particular natural context in which the water is found.
There is much historical evidence that our social institutions have
adapted in remarkably ﬂexible ways to the physical circumstances inﬂu-
encing our need and capacity to control water use. One telling example is
the diﬀerence in the forms of law relating to surface water use in the east-
ern part of the United States and the corresponding forms in the west.18
Broadly speaking, the eastern states have laws based on the doctrine
of “riparian rights,” which give no absolute right of ownership of water
resources to any party but a circumscribed right of use to parties located
on the bank of a river or lake. The western states, by contrast, have laws
based on the doctrine of “prior appropriation,” which essentially grants
a more or less unqualiﬁed right to the ﬁrst established user of a water
resource. (There also exist some hybrid legal variants in a number of
central states.) The diﬀerence between the two systems is that riparian
rights emphasize the community of water users and restrict what any
one member of the community may do with a source of water because
of possible external eﬀects on other members. Currently, the cost of
this closer regulation of water use is to restrict incentives for the direc-
tion of water resources toward their most productive applications. Prior
appropriation, however, leaves the interactions between diﬀerent users
of a water resource more open to resolution by collective negotiation
but also frees an individual user to adapt applications (for example, by
transporting water to a diﬀerent place) if it is proﬁtable to do so. Nei-
ther system is perfect, but the former is one whose virtues will be more
apparent when there are signiﬁcant community interactions and diﬃcul-
ties in coordinating a community-level response to these. The system of

180 • Chapter 11
prior appropriation will be better suited to situations where community
interactions are less important than a real need to direct scarce water
resources to productive uses. Indeed, in the American west, where nine-
teen states employ a version of the prior appropriation doctrine (nine of
them strictly), water is much scarcer than in the east, and the law evolved
originally to deal with the high water intensity of hydraulic mining tech-
niques in places that were remote from rivers—and at a time when the
impact of inorganic pollutants on water quality had yet to provoke public
concern. The picture is somewhat more complex with respect to ground-
water rights, where issues of users’ interdependence are more likely to
arise, but a similar east–west division is visible here too.
The notion that the physical characteristics of water might inﬂuence
the evolution of the social and legal practices that deﬁne it as a commod-
ity was taken to an extreme and ambitious conclusion by the historian
Karl Wittfogel in his book Oriental Despotism.19 He used the nature of
water to explain not just parts of a legal system but an entire structure
of centralized social and political authority. Wittfogel sought to explain
the fact that earlier historians, “contemplating the civilizations of the
Near East, India and China … found signiﬁcant in all of them a combina-
tion of institutional features which existed neither in classical antiquity
nor in medieval and modern Europe … the common substance in the
various Oriental societies appeared most signiﬁcantly in the despotic
strength of their political authority.” Wittfogel argued that all of these
societies were created in response to the need to organize what he called
“hydraulic agriculture”—large-scale irrigation works transporting water
from its natural location to where it could most enhance the fertility
of the soil. In contrast to the opportunistic exploitation of rainwater
resources (“small-scale irrigation farming”), which could be achieved by
merely local forms of cooperative organization, hydraulic agriculture
“involves a speciﬁc type of division of labor. It intensiﬁes cultivation.
And it necessitates cooperation on a large scale.” The division of labor
required to build large irrigation works required a degree of political
authoritarianism unnecessary for self-suﬃcient city-states. It also pro-
vided the political authorities with the human resources to build palaces,
temples, and other public works and to maintain that control over the
population which had been necessitated by the requirement for forced
labor in the ﬁrst place. In other words, from an analysis of speciﬁc phys-
ical attributes of water (“Water is heavier than most plants. It can never-
theless be much more conveniently managed…”), Wittfogel went on to
derive a complex and ambitious thesis about the diﬀerences between

Water: Commodity or Social Institution? • 181
societies that happened to ﬁnd themselves in a diﬀerent relation to
this vital natural resource. He did not claim that these diﬀerences were
inevitable and cited numerous cases where the tendency implied by the
underlying physical relationship to water was outweighed by other fac-
tors. But whether or not the substance of his thesis is ultimately convinc-
ing, the underlying idea remains a powerful one: that water as a resource
takes many forms, some of which are due to its varying physical char-
acteristics and some to the varying rules and customs governing its use.
These rules and customs can be so central to the organization of society
that they come in turn to inﬂuence many of society’s other features.
Certainly, more modest analogs to Wittfogel’s argument have been
amply documented. There is considerable evidence that local commu-
nities have been able to evolve sophisticated informal systems of col-
lective management of irrigation resources, systems that can overcome
incentives for the individual to “free ride.” One study of south India by
Robert Wade showed that “villages located towards the tail-end of irriga-
tion systems and with soils fertile enough to support a high density of
livestock show a larger amount of corporate organization than villages
elsewhere,” because these features create a higher risk of crop loss if
water is poorly managed.20 There is therefore a greater incentive to man-
age the economic interdependencies between farmers through a system
of rules, collectively determined and collectively enforced. The fact that
these communities are local is not accidental. It’s easier to evolve sys-
tems that govern the interdependencies between farmers when farms are
close enough together for monitoring and enforcement to be relatively
easy. Wittfogel claimed that the sheer scale and geographical extent of
the water systems he described necessitated correspondingly grander
solutions.
Over the course of history, our social institutions have adapted
remarkably well to the resource constraints imposed by water availabil-
ity. But this is hardly a ground for optimism about our immediate future:
just as nobody lives in the United States as a whole, nobody lives through
the course of history as a whole. There are several reasons why the social
institutions that have adapted well to past constraints may prove cum-
bersome and ineﬀectual in the face of future challenges. Partly this is
just because success in the past is no guarantee of success in the future.
For example, one impressive by-product of the hydraulic civilizations
described by Wittfogel was the development of water clocks, which were
probably far more accurate than the early mechanical clocks developed
in Europe. Yet the historian David Landes has described this technology

182 • Chapter 11
as “a magniﬁcent dead end,” because the rival mechanical clock devel-
oped in Europe, “aside from its usability in all times and weather … was
susceptible of miniaturization, to the point of eventual portability.” This
allowed people, he claims, to apply notions of eﬃciency in the use of time
to the bustle of their everyday lives rather than having to rely on time-
keeping by the public authorities. “The clock made possible, therefore,
private as against public, general as against hieratic or royal time.” The
result in his (admittedly speculative) view was a notion of productivity
and its enhancement that was to underlie much subsequent technolog-
ical advance. “That the mechanical clock did appear in the West, and
with it a civilization organized around the measurement and knowledge
of time, is a critical factor in the diﬀerentiation of the West from the Rest
and the rise of Europe to technological and economic hegemony.”21
A second reason for concern has to do with the direction of water
ﬂow and the asymmetries this creates among users. Upstream users
of a watercourse have a capacity to aﬀect the welfare of downstream
users without being subject to a reciprocal dependency. True, some opti-
mists believe that informal bargaining between the aﬀected parties can
overcome the eﬀects of environmental externalities: a renowned exam-
ple is the economist Ronald Coase, who pointed to the fact that many
lighthouses, generating many beneﬁcial externalities, were built by pri-
vate individuals rather than by state institutions. Indeed, the famous
“Coase theorem” argues that if negotiations can be costlessly undertaken
between all aﬀected parties, all problems of externalities can be resolved.
The polluter may not care about the damage she inﬂicts on the pollutee,
but the pollutee can oﬀer her enough inducements to make her care.22
The optimistic expectation that downstream users can negotiate eﬃ-
cient water management solutions with those upstream—that they will,
in other words, be able to oﬀer inducements to upstream users that cost
less than the beneﬁts gained from the arrangement—ignores the fact
that such bargains, even if desirable, may not be credible. Promises made
today (even in good faith) may be impossible to resist breaking tomor-
row, especially given the long time-spans needed for planning water use
and especially given that political regimes cannot bind their successors.
If every individual living along a trade route were empowered to extract
a toll from commercial traﬃc, such traﬃc would soon dry up. Agree-
ments between individuals about eﬃcient levels of tolls would crum-
ble in the face of the incentive to raise tolls unilaterally. Because such
agreements are hard to monitor, and the individual beneﬁts of breaking
them exceed any likely cost imposed by a retaliation on the part of those

Water: Commodity or Social Institution? • 183
who suﬀer further along the route, each individual would be tempted to
cheat and raise the toll. So, just as the great land routes through Cen-
tral Asia became economically important only once the Mongol emperors
established a centralized monopoly of force along the way, a formal cen-
tralized control of water systems has proved the only credible solution
once water systems extend over a wide enough area. The presence of
some sixty independent tolls along the river Rhine at the beginning of
the ﬁfteenth century was a major obstacle to continental European trade;
in England, where there were no such river tolls, trade ﬂourished.23 The
multiple depredations of warlords in contemporary Afghanistan may be
an instance of the same phenomenon. Centralized control does not, how-
ever, guarantee eﬃcient outcomes, as the sometimes disastrous environ-
mental record of Soviet central planning should remind us.
The evolution of centralized systems may indeed respond in part
to ecological and economic imperatives. But it is dependent upon so
much else—the stability of political structures, the balance of military
power between rival contenders for control—that it would be foolish
optimism to put great faith in our capacity to resolve conﬂicts over water
resources in the twenty-ﬁrst century. Some of the most important inter-
national interdependencies in water management (to be increased by
future developments in damming and irrigation) occur in the basin of the
river Jordan and in the Tigris and Euphrates system, two of the world’s
most politically volatile regions. The institutions of international law are
weak and of disputed legitimacy; there is no mechanism of centralized
control and no agreed-upon criterion of fairness. One of the lessons of
successful collective management, where it occurs, is that it needs stable
norms, supported by consensus: individual incentives to break an agree-
ment are hard enough to overcome even within a generally accepted and
legitimate system. Where there is no legitimacy, no agreed-upon norm,
eﬃciency and equity in the use of water resources may be almost impos-
sible to attain.
The variety of the social institutions that have evolved to deal with
water, testament though it is to the ﬂexibility and adaptiveness of human
society, implies also that the norms and values that characterize our atti-
tudes toward water will be many and conﬂicting. Some people reject the
very idea of treating water as an economic commodity, perhaps because
they think (mistakenly) that if water is an economic commodity it cannot
at the same time be anything else, such as an object of veneration. What-
ever the reason, metering water use and charging for consumption has
been strongly opposed in many countries where water has traditionally

184 • Chapter 11
been treated as a “basic good” that should be, and often is, provided free
by the state. But such arguments make sense only when water is plen-
tiful. Once it becomes scarce, as in more and more parts of the world
today, failing to charge for its consumption will only make it even more
scarce in the future. Some people argue that charging prices for water
is futile because household water consumption is relatively insensitive
to both price and income: a study of the city of Austin, Texas, in the
late 1980s showed that per capita water consumption had changed lit-
tle since the 1950s and not at all since 1970, although the city and its
consumption habits had changed dramatically in every other imaginable
respect. 24 But though direct household consumption may be relatively
insensitive to circumstances, indirect consumption through agriculture
and industry has large eﬀects on water use and is extremely sensitive to
prices. The “green revolution” in agricultural technology in poor coun-
tries since the 1960s has dramatically increased the water intensity of
agriculture, and alternative methods of producing everything from cot-
ton to cars may consume very diﬀerent amounts of this scarce resource.
There is no serious alternative to treating water as an economic com-
modity. It is scarce in many locales even if it is not globally scarce, and
its local scarcity may eventually prove globally threatening. But calling
it an economic commodity begins rather than ends the argument. What
would it mean to treat it as such? First, water’s scarcity requires users
to be given incentives to use it eﬃciently. These need not always be
price incentives, but we know that price incentives often have desirable
features that other kinds do not. In particular, they make possible the
decentralization of decisions, when we lack the detailed knowledge and
mutual trust required for direct regulation or moral persuasion. The
great merit of charging a price for water is that we no longer need to
argue who deserves it more: if people are poor they may deserve our
help, but if water can be priced to reﬂect its scarcity relative to other
goods, we no longer need to argue the case for helping them separately
when we consider food, housing, water, clothes, and all the other aspects
of their lives. Proper pricing strengthens rather than weakens the case
for helping the poor.
A second implication of treating water as an economic commodity
would be to abandon trying to manage water in similar ways across the
whole range of circumstances in which it is found in the world. It is quite
natural that arid zones and humid zones should have diﬀerent systems
of law, diﬀerent institutional arrangements, even diﬀerent attitudes
toward pricing and regulation. Thirdly, treating water as an economic

Water: Commodity or Social Institution? • 185
commodity would mean accepting diﬀerent solutions under diﬀerent
technological constraints. For example, the scale economies involved in
transmission and storage of water make a degree of monopoly almost
inevitable. Water puriﬁcation technologies, on the other hand, are less
dependent on large scale (indeed, it often makes sense to treat water
contamination close to the point of discharge rather than wait until
water has collected in large quantities). The result is that decentral-
ized solutions may be more appropriate to water puriﬁcation than to
water distribution. Fourthly, treating water as an economic commodity
means acknowledging trade-oﬀs: diﬀerent uses of water involve diﬀer-
ent costs and beneﬁts, and diﬀerent distributions of these costs and
beneﬁts across the population. Potentially explosive international con-
ﬂicts over water resources may be made less dangerous by being brought
explicitly into the kind of horse-trading arena that is the daily currency
of relations between states when it comes to other resources.
We saw at the start of this chapter, in the comparison of Mexican piped
water with French bottled water, that cultural perceptions may make two
quite diﬀerent economic commodities out of chemically interchangeable
substances. Systems of law, criteria of fairness, and structures of politi-
cal authority have for centuries shaped the institutions that govern the
management and distribution of water. These diﬀerences are explicable
in terms of the conditions to which they were a response. They will need
increasingly to be reconciled if conﬂicts over the world’s water resources
are to be avoided in the coming century.
Is there a realistic way to reconcile these diﬀerences, given the capacity
for tunnel vision that characterizes our species? In chapter 1 we looked
at the remarkable coordination of international activity that takes place
in the manufacture of shirts. This is achieved without any overall plan,
simply through the reaction of individual participants to the possibilities
oﬀered by customers and suppliers, possibilities represented to them by
prices at which they expect to be able to buy and sell.
Perhaps the hope for escaping conﬂicts over water, as for escaping
conﬂicts over other resources, lies in ensuring that prices more accu-
rately reﬂect costs, the costs to everyone and not just to the immediate
user. To see what this would mean, we must ﬁrst look at how systems of
prices get established in the ﬁrst place, and their strengths and limita-
tions in coordinating reciprocal exchange. This is the task of chapter 12.

Prices for Everything?
Prices as Coordinators
Traders in shares around the world sit in front of computer screens
displaying dozens, sometimes hundreds, of numbers at a time. These
numbers are prices, and they represent the amounts of money at which
other traders (known as “market makers”) are willing to exchange what
are literally shares in the control of ﬁrms—rights to participate with
others in deciding how these ﬁrms should be run, and of course to be
paid some fraction of the proﬁts that result from doing so. Sometimes
nothing much happens for a long time: the numbers rarely change, and
the faces in front of the screens express a trancelike state. Sometimes
news spreads across the world like an electronic spasm: one company
reports that its proﬁts are unexpectedly low; another announces suc-
cessful trials of a miracle drug; the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve
makes a few enigmatic remarks. The news may sound arcane: six U.S.
senators announce that they will vote against a proposal in the Obama
health plan to allow a public insurance option to compete with private
companies, but within moments the share prices of the big private insur-
ers have begun to climb, so somebody is paying very close attention.1 The
clicks of thousands of computer mice transmit orders from the people
who hear the news ﬁrst: buy, sell. The prices change, and others who
haven’t yet heard the news realize something is going on. The adrenalin
surge is powerful: a subtler form of entertainment than bullﬁghts or
public gladiatorial contests but—for those who like that sort of thing—
apparently no less compulsive. And it is very public indeed: traders in
Tokyo and in Tierra del Fuego may be sitting in very distant rooms, pos-
sibly alone, but the chances are that the numbers they are looking at
are the same, even if they are not connected to the same website. Two
quotations for the price of Microsoft shares cannot diﬀer by more than
a tiny margin; if they do, the Lone Rangers who patrol cyberspace will
quickly eliminate the diﬀerence by buying cheap and selling dear.

Prices for Everything? • 187
Not all prices are so public. Visit the souks in Marrakech, and let your
eye linger for a fraction of a second over a carpet. Instantly you will be
invited to discuss the matter, conﬁdentially, perhaps over a glass of mint
tea. You will always be oﬀered a “special price.” There is no deception
here, so long as you do not presume that your special price will always
be especially low. It will be tailored to what the seller guesses to be your
motivation, your expertise, and your budget. Sometimes that means the
price will be higher than others might pay; sometimes it will be lower,
particularly if you can convincingly signal that your expertise is high or
your motivation and budget are low. But it will be your price, and yours
alone, because no one else has observed what you and your interlocutor
have negotiated.
The prices people pay for apparently similar items can display a
startling variety, one that modern innovations such as computerization
and the internet are not necessarily acting to diminish. Next time you
take an airplane, try asking the two people in the seats next to yours
how much they paid for their tickets. You may easily ﬁnd diﬀerences
of up to ten times: one bought a ticket months in advance, another is
returning without staying a weekend, yet another is traveling standby.
Airlines use sophisticated software to diﬀerentiate their fares by route,
by ticket type, and by the day of travel or the day of sale. Their customers
in turn use sophisticated software to compare fares between one airline
and another. Every seller wants to seduce each individual buyer into pay-
ing as much as she can, and each buyer wants to play the ﬁeld of diﬀerent
sellers so as to pay no more than she must. It is a continual tango, con-
strained only by the mysteries of each buyer’s individuality and the fact
that rival sellers are always somewhere else, while the present opportu-
nity is here, is now.
Both sellers and buyers increasingly call technology to their aid: my
computer has been spied upon by little programs (“cookies”) copied on
to my hard disk by sellers whose websites I have visited. Now, when I
return to Amazon, I am greeted with lists of recommendations suppos-
edly tailored to my unique tastes in reading and viewing matter by a
particularly empathic computer. Car manufacturers use ever more elab-
orate strategies to target people who are likely to have a higher desire to
buy a car than most: some car manufacturers have links with “life event”
sites that oﬀer information and support to people who have recently
married, become parents, gotten divorced, or suﬀered a bereavement,
since market research has shown that 80 per cent of such people buy
a new car within a year. (“Mrs. Smith, we were so sorry to hear about

188 • Chapter 12
your husband. We wonder whether now might be an opportune time to
consider switching to a smaller car.”) But customers can respond with
technology in turn: they visit diﬀerent sites to check prices—doing their
research more thoroughly the more expensive their intended purchase.
And they remain stubbornly individual: far from trading sensibly down,
Mrs. Smith may be planning to splash out on that convertible she never
dared to buy while the old curmudgeon was alive.
How can systems of prices—set in this apparently chaotic way—per-
form the remarkable feat of coordinating all the diﬀerent activities that
contribute to modern economic life? Even something as comparatively
simple as making a shirt involves many stages, as we saw in chapter 1,
and nobody is in overall charge of making sure that the diﬀerent stages
connect with each other. Prices are the terms on which the links between
each stage in the chain are forged: the farmer sells his cotton to the mer-
chant at one price, the merchant sells on to the factory for spinning and
weaving at another. The bargaining at each stage will doubtless be hard,
and one party may walk away with most of the beneﬁts of the deal, but
both will be convinced that they are doing better, if only fractionally,
than they might do by dealing with someone else. The more alternative
opportunities they have, the stronger their bargaining position: the mer-
chant may sell to the factory for a much higher price than he paid the
farmer, but he is less likely to be able to do so if the farmer can negoti-
ate with other rival merchants. That is one reason why so much of the
world’s poverty is concentrated in rural areas, where farmers have few
alternative outlets for what they produce.
The fact that increased opportunities strengthen your bargaining posi-
tion explains how prices respond to supply and demand. Are there too
many potatoes on the market today? Customers can shop around more
keenly and oﬀer lower prices, knowing that if any one seller refuses,
there are always others who may accept. Is there a shortage of fresh
fruit? Now it is sellers who have the upper hand, since there are many
willing buyers and a seller can always try to edge the prices upward.
These price movements are not just about transferring cash from buy-
ers to sellers or vice versa, as though the market were one continuous
lottery. For they also signal to those who hold supplies where those sup-
plies can best be sent. When the harvest has failed in one region, the high
prices act as a magnet to outsiders, dampening the price rise but—most
importantly—moving supplies to where the shortages are.
Such a healthy stabilizing reaction depends, of course, on outsiders
having access to where the opportunities are. Not all markets are so

Prices for Everything? • 189
open. When instead access is limited and the markets are controlled by
a monopolist or by a few insiders (perhaps acting together in what is
known as a cartel), then the ability of prices to play a beneﬁcial coordi-
nating role may be seriously compromised. A monopolist will typically
take advantage of the absence of any alternative supplier to raise prices.
He will not raise them without limit, because eventually he would lose
all his customers, who would decide to forgo what he has to sell. But
he will be prepared to sacriﬁce some customers in order to make more
money out of those who remain. The fact that he does so leaves the lost
customers without access to these goods. They would have been willing
to buy them at a price that reﬂected what it cost the monopolist to pro-
duce or procure them, but his unwillingness to supply them at such a
price leads to a lost opportunity for mutually beneﬁcial trade. This is an
example of what economists term a “market failure,” a case where the
prices established by markets no longer send the signals that make eﬃ-
cient exchange between strangers possible. Pathologies such as these—
even more common in the fragmented markets of the developing world
than in rich, industrialized societies—provide the intellectual foundation
for policies to restrain monopolies, open markets, and encourage trade.
Such policies are highly unpopular with would-be monopolists and are
often diﬃcult to devise and enforce, but almost all countries now at least
claim to be giving them serious attention.
It is when there is competition between rival buyers and sellers (so
each has a choice of partners with whom to deal), when buyers and sell-
ers are reasonably well-informed about the opportunities they face, and
when transactions between two people have no serious eﬀects on any-
body else, that tunnel vision is at its most impressive and eﬀective. The
whole complex process of coordinating international shirt production is
ﬁtted together by nothing more sophisticated than the restless oppor-
tunism of buyers and sellers, each seeking out chances to make a slightly
better deal. When consumers decide they like a particular design better
than another, sellers take the chance to shade the prices upward. In turn
they seek out more supplies so as to take advantage of the more favor-
able prices, leading the makers of cloth, thread, and buttons to steer their
eﬀorts in the direction of the more popular design. Nobody is trying to
make the system as a whole respond to demand, but that is exactly what
it does. And anyone who is contemplating a career in shirt-making can
make a shrewd assessment of the prospects by looking at the prices of
shirts, and the prices of all the things that are needed to make shirts,
and calculating whether the margin between the two oﬀers any space

190 • Chapter 12
to breathe. If shirt prices rise by more than the prices of the cloth, the
thread, and the buttons, a few more would-be shirtmakers may decide to
try and ﬁll that space. A career in shirt-making remains a gamble—but it
is a gamble whose odds are better described by the prices of shirts and
their components than by any other information anyone could reason-
ably demand.
The idea that prices summarize important information about the
future in an accessible and easily interpretable way is the key to under-
standing how they can play their extraordinary coordinating role. Shirt
prices tell us something about how much buyers value the chance to own
shirts. The prices of cloth, thread, and buttons tell us something about
how much the producers of these items mind the trouble, expense, and
sheer hard work of creating them. If there is a margin between the two,
this tells us there’s room for shirt-owners and shirtmakers to come to an
arrangement that is in the interests of both sides. Tunnel vision works,
when it does, by putting together a vast jigsaw of bilateral arrangements
that, step by uninspiring step, make all of us dramatically better oﬀthan
we would be if we had to put together all the components of our lives
alone.
Prices as Opinion Polls
What may seem mysterious is how prices can come to summarize infor-
mation in this way. What is the process by which a price, changing in
response to the vagaries of many individual decisions to buy and sell,
can come to embody information about anything interesting at all?
To see how, make a visit to Iowa Electronic Markets2 in the weeks
leading up to an American presidential election. This is a site run by the
Henry B. Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa for the pur-
pose of trading in ﬁnancial contracts (“stocks”). But unlike most ﬁnancial
contracts, such as those traded on the New York Stock Exchange, many
of the contracts here make cash payments that depend on something
other than the performance of ﬁrms. Here you can buy a contract that
pays a dollar if the Republican candidate wins the presidential election,
and nothing otherwise (similar contracts are available for the Democratic
candidate, and for any independents who may stand). This is known
as a “winner-takes-all” contract, in contrast to other contracts that may
pay a range of diﬀerent amounts for diﬀerent outcomes. As the election
approaches, watch the price at which the stock trades. It rises as traders’
estimates of the candidate’s probability of victory improve and falls as

Prices for Everything? • 191
they decline. Why? Suppose the current price is ﬁfty cents. Any trader
who thinks the Republican has a better-than-even chance of victory will
buy, while one who thinks the chance is worse than even will sell. If
there are more of the former than the latter, the price will rise until the
optimists and pessimists just balance each other out. If news comes in
making it more likely that the Republican will win, the price at which they
balance will rise. The price of the stock therefore represents the center
of the traders’ estimates (actually what statisticians call a median)3 of
the probability of victory. The price was correctly predicting a Demo-
cratic victory two months before the election of November 2000—I say
correctly, because “victory” was deﬁned as gaining the largest number
of votes cast, a feat achieved by candidate Al Gore even if this did not
suﬃce to take him to the White House.
As well as a winner-takes-all contract, whose price represents an esti-
mate of the probability of victory, you can also trade contracts that pay a
number of cents equal to the candidate’s share of the popular vote. These
contracts will therefore trade at a price equal to the traders’ collective
best guess about the share of the vote. This is exactly the same informa-
tion that traditional opinion polls have sought to discover, and the Iowa
Electronic Markets have a track record in prediction that most opinion
pollsters would envy. Three months before the elections of both 1992
and 1996 the markets were predicting Bill Clinton’s share of the popu-
lar vote to within two percentage points of the eventual outcome. And
in the 2008 elections the markets had been predicting a roughly four-
percentage-point victory for the Democratic candidate for most of the
previous two years before Barack Obama eventually won with a margin of
around seven points. Other markets which allow trades in larger sums of
money than the IEM maximum, such as Intrade, have also shown impres-
sive performances in political prediction. It’s not surprising, really: an
opinion poll gathers together information about the voting intentions of
one or two thousand people, who have no particular incentive to tell the
pollsters the truth about their intentions. The electronic markets gather
together information about the predictions of as many traders as want to
get involved, and they have a ﬁnancial incentive not only to tell the truth
but to gather information from as many other sources as they possibly
can.
Other websites oﬀer an even more varied array of future events on
which to speculate. Newsfutures4 is a French/American site that has run
bets on various stages in the war on terrorism, the outcomes of the Tour
de France and the Super Bowl, the likelihood that the SETI project will

192 • Chapter 12
discover messages from extraterrestrial beings and that archeologists
will discover the tomb of Cleopatra, the state of human cloning research,
and the love lives of the celebrities Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears,
among other issues of more or less cosmic signiﬁcance. In each case
there are winner-takes-all contracts, deﬁned around a speciﬁed event,
and by tracking the price of the contract, you can plot precisely the rise
and fall in traders’ conﬁdence that the event will happen as described.
Intrade5 is an Irish site that oﬀers the opportunity to bet on a wide range
of events at much larger stakes. The Hollywood Stock Exchange6 oﬀers
contracts of a slightly diﬀerent kind: they are essentially bets on the
box-oﬃce takings of particular movies, and the value of one contract in
dollars is the number of millions of dollars that the movie in question
grossed in its ﬁrst month of release. If the movie grossed 50 million dol-
lars, the contract is redeemed for ﬁfty dollars. Anyone who has informa-
tion suggesting the current price is an underestimate can expect to make
money by buying contracts; anyone who thinks it is an overestimate is
well-advised to sell. When the optimists and the pessimists just balance
each other out, the price will remain steady. So, just as in the other mar-
kets, the price at any time represents a collective best guess, in the sense
that the number of people thinking it an underestimate just matches the
number of people believing it to be an overestimate.
These markets are purely ﬁnancial, in the sense that they involve trans-
fers of money between participants under certain carefully deﬁned cir-
cumstances, but no real goods change hands. A great number of markets,
of course, do involve the transfer of real goods or the performance of real
services. Here what prices do is to represent information about the value
that the goods or services have to the traders. And sometimes the whole
purpose of the markets is to elicit this information so as to ensure that
the goods or services pass to the traders that value them most. In recent
years the role of prices in revealing information has been particularly
visible in the case of auctions.
Auctions
Auctions have been used for a long time and to sell many things: we know
that slaves were auctioned in Roman times and tulips in seventeenth-
century Holland, while the list of categories on the eBay website runs all
the way from “Antiques and Art” to “Yo-yos.” Edward Gibbon recounts
how the entire Roman Empire was oﬀered for auction by the Praetorian
Guard after their murder of the Emperor Pertinax in 193 c.e., since they

Prices for Everything? • 193
feared that from the expected successor, Sulpicianus, “they might not
receive a just price for so valuable a commodity”:
This infamous oﬀer … reached at length the ears of Didius Julianus, a
wealthy senator.… The vain old man hastened to the Praetorian camp,
where Sulpicianus was still in treaty with the guards, and began to bid
against him from the foot of the rampart. The unworthy negotiation
was transacted by faithful emissaries, who passed alternately from one
candidate to the other, and acquainted each of them with the oﬀers of
his rival. Sulpicianus had already promised a donative of ﬁve thousand
drachms (above one hundred and sixty pounds) to each soldier; when
Julian, eager for the prize, rose at once to the sum of six thousand
two hundred and ﬁfty drachms, or upwards of two hundred pounds
sterling. The gates of the camp were instantly thrown open to the pur-
chaser; he was declared emperor, and received an oath of allegiance
from the soldiers, who retained humanity enough to stipulate that he
should pardon and forget the competition of Sulpicianus.7
An auction works by asking people to state their own prices, or at least
to indicate their willingness to pay prices announced by an auctioneer,
or by some other mechanism such as a clock. They can do so openly,
or in a sealed envelope, or in various other ways. People are often cau-
tious about what they say, at least more so than Didius Julianus seems
to have been (though Gibbon records that after he was carried in pro-
cession to the imperial palace, he “passed a sleepless night”). They fear,
often correctly, that the keener they are seen to be to buy something,
the more they will have to pay (in auctions, unlike ordinary markets,
the price at which people actually trade is not determined until after
they have revealed their willingness to pay but adjusts according to the
bids received). So bidders have potentially strong reasons to dissem-
ble. Nonetheless, well-designed auctions succeed in ﬁnding out enough
about how much people really value the goods to allocate them to those
who value them most—an insight the Praetorian Guard put to proﬁtable
use. They may do so through a range of devices. One is to make the win-
ner pay the price of the second-highest bidder (so that people know the
price they pay will not depend on what they themselves say). Another is
simply to encourage bidders to continue until all but one has dropped
out of the race. The last one left does not have to declare the true value
he places on the object, so long as he declares one that is higher than
anyone else is prepared to declare.
Of course, we may doubt whether auctions can really compare the true
value diﬀerent people place on the objects for sale. I may tell myself that

Down through the ages auctions have been used to sell almost
anything, including people. Here are two kinds of human auction. Above, a slave

the wealthy bidder who buys the old-master painting does not really
value it more than I do. He’s just richer; money means less to him. But
the fact that he’s richer means he can aﬀord more of everything than I
can. It’s still true that, compared to me, he values spending his money on
the old master more than on some rival purchase. And it’s in that limited
sense that the auction has allocated the painting to the right person. It
wasn’t the auction’s purpose to redress the imbalance that makes him
richer than I am, merely to ensure that, given the existing imbalance that
gives some people more money than others, the painting goes to the
person who most wants to spend his money on that particular object.
In recent years, auctions have been used increasingly to make a num-
ber of decisions that used to be made by government committees with-
out the involvement of any kind of price mechanism at all. An auction
of radio spectrum licenses for third-generation mobile telephony in the
United Kingdom in March and April 2000 raised the remarkable sum
of 22.5 billion pounds—and this for a privilege (the right to broadcast
on a particular part of the electromagnetic spectrum) that used to be
awarded free to broadcasters and telecom companies alike. In princi-
ple that sounds like good news: the licenses go to those companies
who can make best use of them, and public assets yield revenue to the
state instead of unearned proﬁts to company shareholders. In practice,
though, the good news was tempered by an increasing concern that the
companies concerned may have paid too much, may have suﬀered from
a problem that is known as “the winner’s curse.” In the example of the
painting discussed above, we assumed that buyers wanted a painting
only for their own enjoyment, so that in deciding how much to bid they
had to consult only their own private preferences. In fact, even in art
auctions, many buyers care not only about their own enjoyment of an
object but also about how much the object may fetch on the market in
the future. This is not a subjective matter but an objective (though still
unknown) fact. In auctions of spectrum licenses, the diﬀerences that
exist between companies are small compared to the uncertainty they all
face about how proﬁtable the markets for third-generation mobile tele-
phony will turn out to be. In these circumstances there is a real danger
that the auction may allocate the objects in question not to those who
really value them most but simply to those who are the most wildly opti-
mistic.
“It’s bad news: you’ve won the auction.” The discovery that you were
the greatest optimist of the bunch should often lead you to wonder
what it is that other people know and you don’t. It is a question Didius

196 • Chapter 12
Julianus might well have asked himself. The economist Paul Klemperer
has described Julianus’s victory in the auction for the Roman Empire
as “an early and sad case of the winner’s curse,” since he reigned for
only two months before being overthrown and executed by Septimius
Severus.8 Less violently, the telecom companies that won licenses in the
European spectrums auction have seen their credit ratings downgraded,
their share prices fall, and some of their executives depart to a comfort-
able but nevertheless unwilling retirement. Not many readers will shed
tears for Julianus, and many will likewise feel that the directors of large
companies are paid very large sums of money not to be wildly optimistic
and do not deserve great sympathy for suﬀering the winner’s curse. But
these examples suggest a question about the merits of a system that
awards the spoils systematically to the optimists: is this compatible with
a role for prices as summarizing and transmitting reliable information
about the future?
Actually, this is a misleading way to put the question. Auctions, like
ordinary markets, tend (when they work smoothly) to allocate goods to
those people who most want to own them, without asking questions
about whether this strength of desire is intrinsic or springs from foolish
optimism. Prices for any transaction will settle, as we saw above, at a
level that compromises between the valuations of the more optimistic
traders and the valuations of the more pessimistic. The fact that traders
will end up owning the goods about which they have been most opti-
mistic (relative to others) is what gives both optimists and pessimists
the best incentive to avoid casual misjudgments. You pay the price of
your optimism by being obliged to own the goods about which you were
so optimistic. Even the most enlightened committee of inquiry lacks so
keen an incentive to reach a reasonable collective judgment. As we shall
see in chapter 15, there are strong grounds for saying that markets can
sometimes reﬂect, and even magnify, collective bouts of overoptimism
or overpessimism in modern society. What is remarkable about market
prices is their capacity for reﬂecting individuals’ valuations at all; if these
valuations are foolish, nothing can prevent the resulting market prices
from being foolish too.
Still, auctions would not continue to attract participants if only the
foolish ever won. Most of those who take part in auctions know about the
winner’s curse and adjust their bidding behavior to take it into account.
This makes them cautious, and the greater the uncertainty about what
they are buying, the more cautious they will be (a tendency that has
been well-documented in studies of auctions where signiﬁcant amounts

Prices for Everything? • 197
of money are at stake, notably auctions of oil-drilling rights).9 Cautious
buyers mean less revenue for sellers, who therefore have good reason to
reveal as much information as they can about what they are selling and
to ﬁnd ways to make that information as trustworthy as they can. It’s
not always easy to convince skeptical buyers that your information is
trustworthy, but the ingenious feedback system pioneered by eBay (and
now used by many other sites) has been an important reason for the
remarkable success of this web-based auction ﬁrm. Buyers and sellers
leave ratings about each other, as well as comments, and other buyers
and sellers use them to decide whether they can trust someone they
have never met. As a cruise around the eBay site will quickly reveal,
a high proportion of sellers receive ratings from buyers that are over
99 per cent positive. All well-designed auctions not only rest upon trust
but propagate it: eBay has found a remarkable institutional mechanism
for spreading trust across a vast and widely dispersed community of
internet users.
Is Everything for Sale?
Modern economic life has resulted in the use of explicit prices for a
far greater proportion of exchanges between individuals than was true
for our ancestors. This follows from the uncontroversial fact that the
division of labor has become more extensive and sophisticated, involv-
ing more transactions between strangers. When you’re exchanging with
strangers you need to be particularly careful about keeping accounts—
indeed, accounting systems are central to the systematic symbolic rea-
soning human beings have evolved to handle a complex division of labor,
as we saw in chapters 2 and 3. Some people also believe (though this is
much more speculative) that more exchanges than in the past are made
on explicitly reciprocal terms even between people who know each other,
as part of a deal and involving a clear understanding about the quality
and quantity of both sides of the exchange. In contrast to actions taken
unilaterally, with the actions of some other party in the future remaining
opaque or uncertain, these explicit deals can be said to bring prices into
the realm of familiar relationships. Some people have seen this latter
tendency as an unfortunate consequence of the more widespread use of
explicit prices, as a regrettable commercialization of modern life. If we
are all becoming, in Oscar Wilde’s famous description of a cynic, peo-
ple who know “the price of everything and the value of nothing,” then
modern markets are institutions of vulgar calculation that have been

198 • Chapter 12
sweeping away a subtle heritage of gift exchange based on trust and
mutual esteem.
However we feel about modern markets, it is important not to exag-
gerate the degree of spontaneity in the interactions of our ancestors. The
anthropologist Marcel Mauss argued in his book The Gift that in what he
called “archaic societies” gifts are “in theory voluntary, in reality given
and returned obligatorily,” and that gift exchange constituted the major
mechanism of circulation of goods in such societies.10 If so, one might
imagine that in such societies prices could be established for transac-
tions just as they are in market societies even if they were not prices
expressed in terms of money (“six sheep for one cow”). Exchanges might
easily be every bit as explicit, just as much the product of wheeling and
dealing, even if they come described as gifts. Vulgar calculation in period
costume, you might say. The impression that prices have become more
central to familiar relationships in the modern world might be due sim-
ply to our failure nowadays to be realistic about the nature of relation-
ships in traditional societies.
In fact, though, Mauss argued that gifts were diﬀerent from monetary
transactions in an important way. In particular, the nature of obligation
incurred on receipt of a gift was not determined wholly or even primar-
ily by the nature of the goods received but owed a great deal to relative
status, and to other social and emotional links between donor and recip-
ient. At times he seemed to believe that the complexity of these links
was under threat from market transactions and that modern societies
would reach a phase “of purely individual contract, of the market where
money circulates, of sale proper, and above all of the notion of price reck-
oned in coinage weighed and stamped with its value.” At other times he
rejoiced in the fact that “a considerable part of our morality and our
lives themselves are still permeated with this same atmosphere of the
gift, where obligation and liberty intermingle. Fortunately, everything is
still not wholly categorized in terms of buying and selling. Things still
have sentimental as well as venal value.”
Given that gifts entailed reciprocal obligations, it is not obvious how
they escaped being considered venal. But it seems to have been part of
the strategy of reciprocity in the societies described by Mauss that its
venality should be hidden, or at least made more opaque. Natalie Zemon
Davis has shown in The Gift in Sixteenth Century France11 that multiple
conceptions of gift-giving have coexisted for centuries; complex rules of
reciprocity have been cloaked by more high-minded ideals of “gratuitous
and non-calculating values” and of a liberality whose only reward was the

Prices for Everything? • 199
gratitude of the recipient. Individuals might be no less (and no more) self-
interested than their modern descendants, but in the language of their
transactions interests were more tacit than obligations and ties. Seen in
this light, what makes transactions with explicit prices diﬀerent from
others is not their motivation, not their venality per se, but the lack of
subtlety with which that venality is communicated. Selling a good is like
giving it to someone and simultaneously reminding them of their debt
to you, a debt that (it is implied) sensitive and intelligent individuals
ought to have been aware of without a reminder and might resent being
brought so vulgarly to their attention.
Gifts may indeed have been a more delicate and reﬁned way than
commercial trade to undertake economic exchange. Like many delicate
and reﬁned arts, therefore, they gave an advantage to those who had
the aristocratic privileges that made their mastery easier to acquire. As
Davis’s study makes clear, the rich and privileged could sometimes give
away a great deal, but they rarely gave away real control over important
resources. She writes: “gifts opened channels of communication across
boundaries of status and literacy. They gave expression to the highly
strained but genuine reciprocity between unequals in the social and eco-
nomic order.” She hardly needs to add that they did nothing to change
that order. The terms on which gifts were exchanged were less transpar-
ent than monetary prices, because those who beneﬁted from the social
order had no interest in allowing others to see just how its beneﬁts were
distributed.
Suppose it were true that transactions even between people who
know each other well have become more transparent, more governed
by explicit prices, in the modern world than they were for our ancestors.
Why might this have happened? One reason could be that the very habits
of systematic reasoning and account-keeping we need in order to han-
dle dealings with strangers have also been applied to our dealings with
those we know well. Once a set of mental habits has been developed for
an area of life where it is urgently needed, it can be applied with much
less trouble and eﬀort to other areas where the need has previously been
less urgent.
Another reason could be that property rights have become more
clearly deﬁned than they once were. We saw in chapter 5 that any suc-
cessful large-scale division of labor requires a degree of social consen-
sus about who owns what, and particularly about who is entitled to oﬀer
goods and services in an exchange. This consensus may be embodied in
a formal system of law, such as a registry of land title, an appropriate set

200 • Chapter 12
of statutes governing the exercise of this title, and a system of enforce-
ment that allows people to exercise their rights. Or the consensus may
be more informal, provided it is considered no less reliable by those who
have to use it. For the more uncertain your right to the goods you oﬀer
to give me tomorrow, the less I shall be able to rely upon your promise
to repay the favor you are demanding of me today.
Some kinds of property right have become clearer and more formal
than they were in ancient and medieval times, though this is particu-
larly true of the industrialized Western societies. In ancient Rome there
was no system of title to urban land. People built their houses anywhere
they could get away with it. Something similar is true of the slum areas of
many cities in poor countries today, though in practice the ability of peo-
ple to get away with building even in slum areas is heavily inﬂuenced by
both legal and illegal constraints. Much of the agricultural land of West-
ern Europe in the Middle Ages was also operated in ways that gave less
clear rights to individuals than they were subsequently to obtain from
the “enclosure” movement. That’s not to say that individuals had no pri-
vate property; on the contrary, the English open-ﬁeld system consisted,
in the words of Deirdre McCloskey, of “scattered strips communally reg-
ulated but privately owned.”12 True common land consisted of pasture
land that was useless for arable cultivation and could only be used for
grazing. But the communal regulation, as well as the frequency of dis-
putes brought about by the fragmented and dispersed plots, meant that
individuals had limited control over the uses to which their own land
could be put. Importantly for our purposes, they bore fewer of the costs
and gained fewer of the beneﬁts of using land in the most fruitful way.
Creating clear property rights is most important where the resources
over which the rights to be held are valuable (which is another way of
saying that they are scarce). For otherwise decisions will be made, and
activities undertaken, which aﬀect these resources—deplete or degrade
them—without taking their value properly into account. We saw in chap-
ter 11 that it was in the water-scarce regions of the western United States
that the most comprehensive systems of property rights to water were
developed in the last century. Throughout the world, title to land has
become more systematic in areas where land is in shortest supply rel-
ative to the demands of people for food and housing. That’s the most
important reason why land titles in much of Africa remain collective,
because in much of Africa it isn’t land that is scarce but people able to
work the land. Wherever it matters that some resource should be treated
as valuable, instead of being considered in limitless supply, it will be

Prices for Everything? • 201
important that someone should have clear rights to the resource; other-
wise care for the resource will be overlooked by the tunnel vision of all
concerned. But when the world’s ecology is changing, systems of prop-
erty rights can take a long time to adapt to the new realities. Some of the
Earth’s environmental resources—its atmosphere, for example—have no
individual owners to speak for them and must rely on the collective con-
science of us all.
Buying and selling anything, whether land or grain or ﬁnancial con-
tracts, requires that the individual selling has a clear set of rights to the
object concerned, including the right to transfer those rights to someone
else. It’s probably true that now more of the objects in our world have
had such rights deﬁned over them than was true in the Middle Ages, but
it would be quite misleading to suggest that this has been a continuous
progression. There are many things that I value but I have no right to
transfer to someone else, beginning with the right to my own freedom,
the transferability of which has been illegal since the abolition of slavery.
And it follows from this that there are many things I value that have no
price, for a price implies a transfer with an explicit return. Sometimes
this restraint on the right of transfer rests on a social consensus, as with
slavery (a consensus that nevertheless did not exist in the United States
until after a savage civil war). Sometimes it rests on what can only be
described as a catastrophic social failure. The economist Hernando De
Soto has written of the startling paradox that many of the poor in the
developing world actually “own” highly valuable assets, beginning with
houses that have been constructed in urban slums.13 But their owner-
ship is purely informal, unrecognized by any legal system, a fact that
makes it impossible for them to use these assets as collateral against
loans, and thereby to raise capital that might be put to productive ends
and help lift the theoretical owners from their socially enforced poverty.
Without the right of transfer, in other words, ownership may leave the
owners powerless, unable to beneﬁt from the rights of exchange that lie
at the heart of the modern division of labor.
The boundaries between the things that have prices and those that do
not are often tested. Here is a striking case, described by Jennifer Gann:
In September 1999 an individual oﬀered his right kidney for sale on
eBay, an internet based auction site. In America, where there are over
47,000 patients awaiting kidney transplants, and where the average
wait for a kidney transplant nearly doubled between 1988 and 1996,
this excited considerable interest. The bidding had reached $5.8 million
before being shut down by the administrators of eBay because the sale

202 • Chapter 12
would violate the U.S. National Organ Transplant Act, passed in 1984,
which prohibits the sale of human body parts. The Act itself is silent
regarding the reason for the prohibition, but the language used during
the congressional hearings debating it leaves no doubt as to the moti-
vation of its sponsors: “if … organs of living people should be oﬀered for
buying and selling, then I think this would represent a major degrada-
tion for humankind … this ‘free-market’ sale of an individual’s organs is
morally oﬀensive and ethically indefensible.” Indeed, the moral repug-
nance which we feel at the thought of selling part of our bodies appears
to be near-universal. The UN and the European Union have, respectively,
encouraged and instructed their member countries to prohibit the sale
of human body parts. The World Health Organization has interpreted
the Universal Treaty on Human Rights as prohibiting the sale of human
organs.14
It’s important to note that what many people ﬁnd oﬀensive about sell-
ing body parts is not necessarily the fact that one person’s organs
will be transferred to someone else. A signiﬁcant proportion of trans-
planted kidneys come from live donors, almost all from close relatives
of the recipient. We usually applaud the generosity of such donors. What
oﬀends some people is the thought of donating body parts as an ele-
ment in an explicit transaction, for a price. (Similar reactions are often
expressed toward surrogate childbearing, commercial sex, and—in some
countries—toward donating blood for money.)15 It may be that people
also suspect some kind of covert transaction in the more unusual cases
where kidneys are donated freely by a stranger—to the point of outright
hostility to the motives of such donations where no such transaction can
be proved, as Larissa McFarquhar reported in The New Yorker in 2009.
Reassurance, however, is at hand from the psychological profession:
In 1967, a long-term study of living unrelated kidney donors was
initiated, with the aim of helping transplant centers form policies
on these confounding individuals. The study subjected the donors
to free-associative interviews, dream analyses, and Rorschach and
thematic-apperception tests. Published in 1971, it found evidence, in
the donors, of primitive masochism, reaction formation against early
sadism, homosexual conﬂict, pregnancy symbolism, and penis envy.
But it argued that, in this, the donors were no diﬀerent from the rest
of mankind, and that, after the operation, each donor reported a deep
feeling of increased self-esteem—a feeing “that he had done something
wholesome and natural with no indication of regret.”16
As she reported, in the United States nearly nine people a day die
while waiting for a kidney transplant. The repugnance some people feel

Prices for Everything? • 203
towards explicit trading in human organs is strong, and the prohibition
on such trade helps them preserve a sense of the integrity of the human
body. But that sense of integrity comes at a cost.
Whether or not we are right to draw the boundaries between mar-
ket transactions and implicit or gift exchanges where we do, the fact is
that there are such boundaries and always have been. Even if we keep
careful account of our dealings with strangers, there are many other
arenas of social life where our interactions are less explicitly recipro-
cal, less overtly part of a deal. Sometimes this is because we are tied by
the impulses and obligations of kinship, as within families. Sometimes
it is because we act out of a wish to participate in some voluntary and
collective activity, as in clubs or within relationships of friendship and
community. Sometimes it is because habit or spontaneity are more agree-
able to us than calculation, and are a luxury whose indulgence does us
no real harm.
But sometimes it is because, for all the remarkable achievements of
markets in coordinating the many component activities of modern life,
there are other institutions that can perform feats of coordination that
rival those of markets. Perhaps the most remarkable of such institutions
is the modern ﬁrm. Many individuals join ﬁrms as part of an explicit
deal, usually involving the promise of a salary against the promise of
work. But once they are in ﬁrms, the day-to-day decisions they take are
governed by a logic quite diﬀerent from the explicit logic of markets. It is
a logic of administrative hierarchies, in which people exercise discretion
and issue and obey instructions, few of which bear any resemblance to
explicit deals that can be characterized by prices. In chapter 13 we shall
explore what ﬁrms can do, why they have grown in size and importance
in modern life, and where the boundaries lie between them and markets.
The fact that ﬁrms have such a central role in the modern division of
labor alerts us to some of the many things that markets cannot do.

Families and Firms
The Boundaries of the Firm
The side streets of any major city in the developing world are full of small
workshops in which manufacturing, repair work, and assorted services
are carried out by groups of people of all ages, often related to each
other. Tailors, garage mechanics, assemblers of radios or plastic toys,
jewelers, and pawnbrokers carry on their business for long hours each
day, usually cooking, sleeping, and doing their laundry in the same build-
ing, ﬁtting their domestic lives and their work complicatedly and—to a
bureaucratic eye—messily around each other. These people depend on
markets for their livelihood, but their relationships with each other have
little of the market about them: they are regulated by a system of instruc-
tions passing between those who exercise authority and those who are
subject to it, with no explicit reciprocity and certainly no price system
to coordinate their actions. Someone is always in charge, even if the out-
sider might not always be able to guess who it is. In the sea of decen-
tralized market relationships, with no one in overall charge, there are
countless such islands of centralization, planning, and hierarchy. These
islands are as necessary to the organization of modern society as is the
sea of markets. One of the great challenges of modern life is to under-
stand where the shoreline should be: where the islands need to end and
the sea to begin.1
The answer matters for many reasons, not least because the modern
ﬁrm has been responsible for a spectacular increase in our ability to
produce goods and services, the physical and social furniture of modern
life. The qualitative psychological leap from hunter-gatherers to modern
humans was made many thousands of years ago, and citizens of ancient
Greece or medieval Paris were already used to dealing with strangers in
a way that brings them mentally much closer to us than to our common
Paleolithic ancestors. But in terms of the sheer quantity of resources we
control and consume, the most dramatic changes have taken place in

Families and Firms • 205
the last two or three hundred years and especially in the last century.
The human species now produces around ﬁfty times as much output,
consuming over seventy-ﬁve times as much energy and over sixty times
as much freshwater, as we did two hundred years ago.2 This is not the
result of market exchange on its own but of the ability of ﬁrms to ﬁt
market exchange and internal organization together in an unprecedent-
edly busy and productive partnership. To see how this has happened, we
need to know how ﬁrms respond to the opportunities market exchange
makes possible.
Sometimes small family organizations like the ones in the back streets
of Jakarta or Marrakech carry out operations that in richer countries are
more likely to take place in large factories. Assembling simple electronic
equipment is one example: radios, alarm clocks, ampliﬁers, keyboards.
On the whole, though, the organizations that perform the ordinary work
of society have evolved in size and structure over time, often in simi-
lar ways in very diﬀerent parts of the world. Some sizes and structures
come through experience to seem better equipped to manage particular
tasks. Except when using slave labor on large estates, farming is an activ-
ity that throughout much of history has relied mainly on families;3 the
large industrial farms that dotted the Soviet landscape were a historical
anomaly imposed by the central planners’ liking for size at any price. Car
manufacture, on the other hand, started out as a small workshop activ-
ity but quickly evolved, under Henry Ford’s pioneering example, into one
dominated by large ﬁrms.4 Already in 1913 Ford produced nearly half
the output of the American car industry, while 299 other ﬁrms produced
the other half (employing ﬁve times as many workers in total as Ford did).
Within a few years most of those other ﬁrms had disappeared. So what
makes the diﬀerence between these two kinds of activity—one suitable
for the small workshop, the other requiring the large factory?
The answer is not as simple as “technology” or “standardization.”
Some hi-tech activities, like building aircraft, do indeed take place in
large ﬁrms: the Boeing Aircraft Corporation employs over 150,000 work-
ers. But others, like the manufacture of precision instruments, are car-
ried out overwhelmingly in small ﬁrms of thirty, ﬁfty, at most a hundred
employees. Silicon Valley is full of such ﬁrms, as are the areas around
Cambridge in England and Munich in Germany. And standardization
works both ways: just as it enabled Henry Ford to concentrate production
in large factories, today it enables Nissan to demand very exact speciﬁ-
cations from suppliers of components, who may be small ﬁrms located
hundreds or thousands of miles away from the main assembly plant.

206 • Chapter 13
To understand the answer we need to go back to families, who at
the dawn of history were the only form of centrally organized institu-
tion known to mankind. Families are a form of cooperative organization
that evolved originally around the care of children, who are helpless
for longer in the human species than in any other, the only mammalian
young to require parental feeding long after they have been weaned.
Feeding and mutual protection were tasks that hunter-gatherers could
undertake in relatively small bands, but once settled agriculture began,
both feeding and protection could beneﬁt from organized cooperation
on a larger scale. The ordinary tasks of agriculture—plowing, sowing,
reaping—were and have remained within the grasp of individual fam-
ilies operating on their own, sometimes calling on friends and neigh-
bors for help at critical periods such as harvest time. But as we saw in
chapter 11, irrigation has sometimes needed much more complex orga-
nization, especially when diverting entire rivers along canal systems to
thirsty land some distance away. Protection, too, required both individ-
ual initiative and collective solidarity. Each family needed an element
of prudence, some skill in combat, and, in particular, the judgment to
know when to ﬁght in defense of its home and possessions and when
to ﬂee. Some families relied on individual prudence alone, ﬁnding pro-
tection through invisibility—like the woodcutter in the forest, a ﬁgure
famous from countless children’s stories, who hoped that marauding
armies would not think his poor hovel worthy of pillage and that he
could run and hide in the unlikely event that they did.
But solidarity was often a wiser strategy. Just as ﬁsh ﬁnd safety in the
school even if the school becomes more conspicuous as a result (and as
merchant ships in wartime sail in convoy even when this makes them
more visible to submarines), so many of the ﬁrst farmers found that
banding together in units larger than families gave them an important
advantage in defense. Farmers are conspicuous anyway, both because
their carving of the ﬁelds leaves unmistakable scars on the landscape
and because they need somewhere to store their harvests and tether
their livestock. So the formation of villages and towns provided a means
for them to band together in their own defense, and subsequently to
build fortiﬁcations more solid than anything a family could manage on
its own. The ﬁrst village settlement at Jericho has been dated to before
9000 b.c.e., and within a thousand years it had grown to a substantial
settlement of several hectares of mud-brick houses with thick walls. The
ﬁrst evidence of the famous city walls comes from the early eighth cen-
tury b.c.e., and the presence of great water tanks, probably for irrigation,

Families and Firms • 207
is attested from the seventh century. And a massive ditch, thirty feet
deep and ten feet wide, was dug into the rock without metal tools. A
single family could never have managed protection on this scale.
The growth of villages, towns, and cities took time. Fortiﬁcations were
a great investment of time and energy for people who had a more press-
ing need to grow or ﬁnd food. And the very conspicuousness of fortiﬁca-
tions could attract as well as deter attack, for they signaled the presence
of something worth stealing. The walls of Jericho were destroyed and
rebuilt many times. Settlements on the scale of Jericho were extremely
rare before about 3000 b.c.e. (Çatal Höyük in Turkey was another, ﬂour-
ishing in the seventh and sixth millennia b.c.e.). But slowly the advan-
tages of scale came to seem decisive to those builders of cities who could
mobilize the necessary manpower, a discovery that crystallized onto the
map of the world the urban civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the
Ganges Valley, Minoan Crete, and China, all before the end of the sec-
ond millennium b.c.e. With defense came a vast increase in each family’s
exposure to strangers, who came to trade, to admire, and to beg, as well
as sometimes to conquer, and who brought with them their animals,
their exotic foods, and their diseases, as well as their strange and some-
times beautiful ideas. With defense also came subjection to the law and
the whim of rulers.
Although much of the interdependence of human beings since the
birth of agriculture has been driven by bilateral trade (by what Adam
Smith called the human propensity to “truck, barter and exchange”), the
foundation of villages, towns, and cities is a sign that there are many
important things that bilateral trade between individual families cannot
achieve. These are tasks that need collective action on a larger scale, and
for most of recorded history these tasks have comprised what has come
to be known as “governance,” namely, the building, the management,
and the defense of the collective assets of the community. Families have
joined together to hunt, to build, to defend themselves, to hold festivals,
and to debate and police the rules that govern their communities, includ-
ing the rules by which bilateral trade is conducted and its agreements
enforced. These tasks—building the physical and social infrastructure
of modern life—are the subject of chapter 16.
In contrast to the great collective tasks of governance, those of ordi-
nary business—planting, weaving, milking, smelting, cooking, trading,
hairdressing, creating the goods and services that furnish the lives of
individuals and families—have remained for most of history well within
the capacity of an ordinary family. Large armies may have a history as old

208 • Chapter 13
as that of cities, but large ﬁrms are, with rare exceptions, an invention of
the last three or four hundred years and did not become common until
around two centuries ago.5 Why did these activities remain exclusively
family activities for so long, and why did they cease to be? The answer
in a word is industrialization, though it is an answer that raises a host
of new questions. At all events, it is industrialization that explains how
some organizations founded simply to carry on business have become,
in scale and sophistication, formidable enough to challenge the power
of governments.
In fact, large ﬁrms have found a place in modern life partly by applying
some of the lessons of the successful armies of the past, notably the dis-
covery that certain tasks can be simpliﬁed and standardized so as to be
easily learned and eﬀectively implemented by a large team of people.6 As
one study of the U.S. Navy records: “In boot camp [the] inductee’s credo
is: ‘If it moves, salute it. If it doesn’t move, pick it up. If you can’t pick it
up, paint it white.’ ”7 Some of the earliest of the large ﬁrms founded in the
early modern period even had a semimilitary mandate, like the East India
Company, founded in 1600 with a charter from Queen Elizabeth I to carry
out trade, but also entitled to make and enforce laws in the territories it
entered. (Similar dual-purpose mandates characterized the Hudson’s Bay
Company of 1670 and the Royal African Company.) But most large ﬁrms,
though they have no literal military function, have much in common with
ﬁghting forces. What ﬁrms shared with armies was a commitment to
control over their members, an insistence on supervising their activities,
behavior, even their personal habits. To cite the U.S. Navy study again:
“The [naval] base is a place of close-cropped haircuts and close-cropped
lawns. Here nature and the human form are controlled, arranged, dis-
ciplined, ready to make a good impression.”8 The same ambition ﬁred
some of the early ﬁrms of Europe’s industrial revolution.
Standardization and Surveillance
The royal manufactory at Villeneuvette, in southwestern France, pro-
vides an early example of this development at work. Today it is a quiet
village invaded by grass and wildﬂowers and full of crumbling buildings,
some of which have been restored to house the artists and craft work-
ers selling to tourists who come to enjoy its bucolic charm. But it was
once a center of intense manufacturing activity. Established in the early
seventeenth century by King Louis XIV’s ﬁnance minister, Colbert, it not
only provided a site on which the work of cloth-making—weaving and

Families and Firms • 209
dyeing—could take place but also housed, fed, and supervised the work-
ers, both on the job and in their few hours of leisure. It was a forerunner
of the mill towns of the nineteenth century, like Bournville near Birming-
ham and Pullman outside Chicago,9 whose purpose was avowedly pater-
nalistic: to see to the welfare of workers, because they would be more
productive if well fed, healthy, and closely watched. Supervisors were to
check on the state of workers’ families, enforce churchgoing, and above
all watch for signs of excessive drinking. Productivity, it was thought,
required an investment of the whole person, not just their presence and
eﬀort during the hours of work.
Nevertheless, Villeneuvette and one or two other places like it (the silk
factories of Northern Italy, for example) were exceptional in the Europe
of the time.10 As the medieval guild system began to break down, its
immediate successor was not industrial production but a ﬂexible and
decentralized system (known in England as “putting out”), in which
spinning, weaving, dyeing, and tailoring were carried out in people’s
homes. Various intermediaries—merchants, ﬁnanciers, general organi-
zers—would organize for the delivery of raw material and collect ﬁn-
ished work. This system, with some local diﬀerences, made up the bulk
of textile manufacture in many countries in Europe and was dominant
in Japan until the late 1920s. It ﬁrst began to give way to the factory
system in England in the eighteenth century, under the inﬂuence both
of technical inventions (such as the water frame, a machine for spinning
with rollers) and of innovations in factory organization. The two went
together: Richard Arkwright, who patented the water frame (although
he had stolen the idea from someone else, as emerged in a famous trial
in 1785), was attracted to the invention in large part because it enabled
the centralization of production and the location of the workforce under
a single large roof. This made it possible to engage in rigorous surveil-
lance of the workers. One near-contemporary observed that
the diﬃculties which Arkwright encountered in organising his factory
system were much greater than is commonly imagined. In the ﬁrst place,
he had to train his work-people to a precision and assiduity altogether
unknown before, against which their listless and restless habits rose in
continual rebellion; in the second place, he had to form a body of accu-
rate mechanics, very diﬀerent from the rude hands which then satisﬁed
the manufacturer.
As the historian Sidney Pollard has put it, “what was needed was reg-
ularity and steady intensity in the place of individual design; and care

210 • Chapter 13
of equipment and material instead of pride in one’s tools. … None of
this came easily to the new workforce.” In the more sinister words of
another historian, “throughout the manufacturing districts, mill owners
were faced with the problem of keeping at regular work men who loved
their independence and their ale.”11
Controversy raged then and has continued to this day over whether the
habits of mind and body necessary for industrialization were compatible
with human dignity. Karl Marx famously thought industrialization “alien-
ated” mankind from its true nature, though he admired enormously the
huge increases in productivity that capitalism had made possible. Lenin
was a great admirer of the scientiﬁc-industrial principles of Frederick
Taylor (and notoriously redeﬁned socialism as “Soviet power plus elec-
triﬁcation”), though again it seems to have been the sheer productivity
that impressed him; Lenin’s spirit was nothing if not competitive. One
of the more thoughtful defenses of the factory system’s eﬀect upon its
workers came from Henry Ford:
I have heard it said, in fact I believe it is quite a current thought, that we
have taken the skill out of work. We have not. We have put in skill. We
have put a higher skill into planning, management, and tool building,
and the results of that skill are enjoyed by the man who is not skilled.12
Of course, the factory system was not just about standardizing the
working habits of individual people. It was about standardization in
many other dimensions too: Henry Ford’s innovations radically changed
the nature of parts manufacture. “The parts were so precisely manufac-
tured that several cars could be disassembled, their parts mixed, and
reassembled; this was said to be impossible with any other low-priced
car before 1913.”13 It was not the idea in itself that was new; precision-
engineered, interchangeable parts had been introduced into gun manu-
facture in New England a century before,14 and the so-called “American
system” was a source of much wonder at the Great Exhibition of 1851
in London.15 What was new was its application at a scale and with a
thoroughness that had never been achieved, or even attempted, before.
Standardization certainly had its costs, notably a reduction in the vari-
ety of goods produced. Henry Ford again:
in 1909 I announced one morning, without any previous warning, that
in the future we were going to build only one model, that the model
was going to be the “Model T,” and that the chassis would be exactly
the same for all cars, and I remarked: “Any customer can have a car
painted any color that he wants so long as it is black.” I cannot say that
any one agreed with me.16

Families and Firms • 211
Ford had understood that by drastically reducing variety in the things
he produced and in the processes by which they were made, he could
make so much more with his workers and his machinery that ownership
of a motorcar could be brought within the reach of the ordinary working
family. Unlike some industrialists since, Ford was not blind to the virtues
of variety. Far from it: he had once worked as a farmhand and expressed
the hope that his Model T car might liberate the American farmer from
what Ford saw as the stultifying monotony of rural life.17 His gamble
worked, and worked spectacularly, because the monotony to which he
consigned his workers did not outweigh for them the very much better
wages he oﬀered than other employers, while the monotony in the design
of his cars did not outweigh for them the very much lower prices he
oﬀered than other carmakers.
And the gamble perhaps worked better in America than it could ever
have worked in Europe. One reason was that Europe was more divided by
legal and regulatory barriers erected by its patchwork of (often ﬁercely
nationalistic) states, so the emergence of a genuine mass market across
the content was much less likely than in America. More subtly, the his-
torian David Landes has suggested that one of the main reasons why
the American economy caught up with the British economy during the
nineteenth century, and had overtaken it (in terms of income per person)
by the eve of the World War I, was that America was socially and cultur-
ally ready for a mass market.18 Millions of Americans were prepared to
tolerate cheap, standardized cars, clothes, and furniture—enough poten-
tial customers to permit production on a continental scale. But Europe
remained a continent divided by language and class diﬀerences, where
those who could aﬀord to buy cars, clothes, and furniture preferred to
pay high prices for craft production whose subtle gradations of quality
advertised the buyer’s social aspirations and achievements. In a world
where the leading manufacturers compete to serve an elite, the ordinary
citizen may never get a chance to express a preference for cheap and
plentiful monotony.
What exactly was the connection, though, between standardization
and production on a large scale? Standardization both permitted and
required large scale. It permitted large scale because it allowed proce-
dures to be automated, often through separating out the many compo-
nent parts of a complex activity, allowing them to be performed repet-
itively at high speed, by people or machines or both. Adam Smith has
a famous discussion in The Wealth of Nations of the way in which even
something so apparently simple as pin-making can be divided into many

212 • Chapter 13
component activities (today we would call them subroutines). This not
only makes them faster to perform but also much easier to learn, par-
ticularly by people who lack a craft training. Indeed, the factory system
played an important role in the transmission of certain kinds of know-
ledge from one person to another, a role that is even more important in
the modern world than it was in Smith’s time, and one that we shall look
at more closely in chapter 14.
Standardization also required large scale because of the need for close
surveillance of the quality of work at each stage of the manufacturing
process. A putting-out system, where people worked in their own homes,
was all very well if anyone could tell at a glance whether their work was
of good enough quality for the purpose in hand. But as soon as the ﬁner
details of quality came to matter, ones that might not be instantly vis-
ible to the naked eye, it became important to oversee the process of
production as it was going on, so that ﬂaws and errors could be cor-
rected before they caused too much damage to the overall product. This
lesson, learned by the early industrialists, was never quite appreciated
by their heirs in the Soviet factory system a century and a half later:
uniting factory workers under one roof was regarded as important by
the Soviets for surveillance of workers’ general discipline and eﬀort but
not for detailed oversight of quality. Not until the car or tank left the
production line (and sometimes not until it reached the eventual user)
would anybody discover whether the parts inside were faulty—by which
time the damage they could do was far greater than if they had been
properly tested when they were ﬁrst made.
Sometimes, of course, large scale has other advantages because it en-
ables particularly big or expensive machines or buildings to be more
eﬀectively utilized. More and more, too, large ﬁrms in the modern world
are in fact networks of factories that may individually be of quite modest
size. The size of the ﬁrm (as opposed to the factories) is necessary to take
advantage of some more intangible and indivisible asset, such as a brand
name, a set of relationships with banks and other investors, a particular
capacity in research and development, or even simply the attention span
of an unusually gifted management team. But scale is often needed when
standardization places a premium on eﬀective oversight of quality, and
where monitoring that quality is hard to do at a distance. As economists
studying the characteristics of diﬀerent organizations tend to put it,
we should expect to see large ﬁrms when there are fewer “transactions
costs” associated with bringing diﬀerent activities inside the ﬁrm than
with conducting them at arm’s length, through the market.

Families and Firms • 213
For activities where scale is less important, by contrast, families may
have a big advantage over large ﬁrms. Typically, scale matters less
when the work cannot really be standardized: perhaps it’s a service that
doesn’t require much technological support and for which personal con-
tact with the client is everything, or the manufacture of a product that
must be customized to the needs of individual buyers. Scale also mat-
ters less when it’s easy to specify the requirements for doing well, so
the job can be done at arm’s length from the person who wants it done.
Alternatively, perhaps the work consists of tasks that individual people
just have to go out and do, like plowing a ﬁeld or painting a wall. You
can’t bring the ﬁeld or the wall to your production line, and though it
may help to have a machine to assist you, many people will not nec-
essarily work proportionately more eﬀectively than one person. (Such
customized, ﬁeld-bound activities can even involve quite advanced tech-
nology, such as tailoring a software package to an unusual business or
devising a series of ﬂow meters for an underground mine.) Then, when
scale matters less, it’s more important that the diﬀerent members of a
team should work together with a general trust in each other’s eﬀort
and goodwill. Unlike networks of strangers, families have been tackling
the cooperation problem at a small scale since human prehistory. Noto-
riously, they have often failed at this, but their collective experience is
matched by no other human institution.
Outgrowing the Family
Firms usually begin as family concerns, in fact: even in the United States
today some 90 per cent of all registered businesses are family busi-
nesses, though the remaining 10 per cent account for a large proportion
of total economic activity. The interesting question is what makes some
ﬁrms outgrow their family origins and reach a scale out of the scope of
any single family to manage.19 Firms that employ one hundred or more
people, to take one simple statistical measure, represent a tiny fraction—
less than 0.5 percent—of all registered ﬁrms in the United States, but
their importance is immense: they employ over 60 per cent of all employ-
ees and account for nearly 70 per cent of total sales revenues.20
Outgrowing the family scale is one of the most signiﬁcant challenges
a family business can face. The historian Alfred Chandler has argued
that the failure of many British businesses to outgrow the dominance
of single families is an important reason for the disappointing perfor-
mance of British industry in the twentieth century in comparison with

214 • Chapter 13
both Germany and the United States, where professional managers took
the reins of many important ﬁrms at a comparatively earlier stage in
their development.21 Why then do countries diﬀer in their ability to face
this challenge? Francis Fukuyama has argued that national culture exerts
a subtle but very important inﬂuence on the size of ﬁrms.22 Any family
ﬁrm that needs to undertake activities requiring large scale will be faced
with the need to bring outsiders into positions of discretion and respon-
sibility; eventually there will not be enough family members to do the
job. But bringing in outsiders is risky: How do you know whom to trust?
How much responsibility should you grant them? And what can you do
if you begin to doubt their loyalty? In fact, argues Fukuyama, all cultures
have traditions of dealing with outsiders, and it is to these traditions that
people look for models when they are considering how to structure their
relations with outsiders in a business setting. Most obviously, families
bring in outsiders through marriage. Some cultures, as in Japan, treat
it as normal for those who marry into a family to be given a full say in
family decisions, to share ownership of family assets, and to be trusted
in positions of family responsibility. Other cultures, as in much of China,
are more protective of blood ties, and less commonly give outsiders who
marry into the family a real say in decisions or real control over assets.
The diﬀerence may seem subtle (and is extremely hard to document in
more than an impressionistic way); it certainly appears to have escaped
those who think there is such a thing as a single set of “Asian values.” But
the result is an important diﬀerence in the average size of ﬁrms between
Japan and comparably capitalistic Chinese societies like Taiwan, Hong
Kong, and Singapore. Large ﬁrms are proportionately much more com-
mon in Japan, claims Fukuyama, because when family businesses are
thinking of expanding, they have cultural models for the inclusion of
outsiders that are not available to family businesses in China.
Naturally, cultural models are not all that a family has to hold on to
when thinking about the right size for its business. There is also the
law. The law plays a particularly important role in protecting the inter-
ests of minority shareholders—which is what family members almost
inevitably become once their ﬁrm grows large enough. An expanding
business requires not only manpower but also capital—the resources to
ﬁnance current activities and investment in the future. A family ﬁrm that
lacks these resources will need to ﬁnd other investors willing to pledge
their own funds. They in turn will do so only if assured of mechanisms
that make it more likely that they will be repaid. Broadly speaking, two
kinds of mechanism exist. One, which is much the more common for

Families and Firms • 215
small ﬁrms, is debt. Debt is a legally enforceable promise that if the ﬁrm
does not repay, the lender can request either seizure of assets or a full
bankruptcy (namely, the administration of the ﬁrm by a court-appointed
oﬃcial who operates in the interest of repaying the ﬁrm’s creditors). The
second mechanism is equity, which means a share in the control over the
ﬁrm’s operations, not just in the event of nonrepayment but on a regular
basis, through the power to appoint the board of directors at a share-
holders’ meeting.23
Families seeking to expand their businesses usually face a diﬃcult
choice. Debt leaves them in control but forces them to make repayments
at a ﬁxed level—one that takes no account of the varying fortunes of the
ﬁrm (though it may perhaps vary with overall conditions in the economy).
The inﬂexibility of these repayment promises leaves the family vulnera-
ble to losing control altogether. Equity, on the other hand, involves much
more ﬂexibility; a ﬁrm can simply declare no dividend if business condi-
tions have been bad that year. But this greater ﬂexibility comes at a real
cost: handing over a share in control today, now.
Shared control is a delicate concept. Anybody who controls more than
half of a ﬁrm’s voting shares can theoretically take all of the decisions
without consulting those who own the rest. This is where the law comes
in. The law typically protects (to diﬀerent degrees in diﬀerent legal sys-
tems) the rights of minority shareholders. The most obvious way in
which it does so is by requiring the same dividend per share to be paid to
all shareholders; the majority may not vote itself a large dividend while
voting a small one to the minority. The law often protects minorities in
other ways as well, for example, by ensuring that takeover bidders must
extend share oﬀers to minorities on the same terms as to others. And
minorities in terms of a ﬁrm’s capital may nevertheless entrench them-
selves by remaining majorities in terms of votes; many families have
retained voting control over their ﬁrms by raising outside capital on a
nonvoting basis. In these circumstances the law protects the outsiders
against the insiders, not vice versa.
There is much controversy over whether the law is right to intervene in
detail in the conditions under which a ﬁrm’s current owners may raise
capital from outsiders. Some argue that restrictions on what majority
shareholders may do merely diminish the ﬂexibility of available ﬁnan-
cial arrangements without really making investors better oﬀ. After all,
investors might reasonably choose to forgo explicit legal protection in
exchange for higher returns, just as they may invest in riskier debt (“junk
bonds”) in return for higher interest rates. Others reply that if the range

216 • Chapter 13
of possible levels of protection is too great, investors may simply become
confused, so it is important to assure a certain basic level of protection
for everyone. This debate has had important repercussions in Europe,
where in July 2001 a controversial Takeover Directive that would have
made it easier for outsiders to dislodge controlling insiders was defeated
in the European Parliament by the narrowest possible margin: the vote
was tied, 273 on each side.24 Whatever the merits of one or another form
of legal protection, it is important to see what the debate is fundamen-
tally about. It is about whether those who have started up a business
(who are often, though not always, families) and who now need the help
of strangers in order to ﬁnance its expansion need the protection or the
restriction of the law, or both, in order to establish the necessary mutual
trust.
As we have seen in previous chapters, markets provide a way for
strangers to exchange with one another. The complex institutions that
underpin modern markets can be understood as ways to establish the
trust that such exchange requires. In just the same way, modern ﬁrms
provide a way for strangers to collaborate on those productive tasks that
require more than exchange and would be impossible without central-
ization, planning, and hierarchy on a signiﬁcant scale. The formal and
informal institutions underpinning modern ﬁrms (everything from com-
pany law and accounting systems to dress codes, safety procedures, and
management-speak) can be understood as ways of making trust achiev-
able between strangers. They allow people who share no blood ties and
who know rather little about each other to place their resources, their
welfare, and sometimes even their lives in each other’s hands. Neverthe-
less, the advantages of large-scale production remain delicate. No one
doubts them when it comes to building aircraft or managing the trans-
mission of electricity, but in many other spheres of life even sophisti-
cated networks of artiﬁcial trust are no match for the spontaneous, face-
to-face variety. Restaurants remain small businesses for the most part.
Those that don’t (like McDonald’s) sell standardization to customers in
lieu of reﬁnement or creativity.25
Technology and Firm Size
How is modern technology changing all of this? Before we look at infor-
mation technology and other such wonders of the modern ﬁrm, it’s worth
looking backward at the way in which earlier technological revolutions
aﬀected the scale of business operations. Eighteenth- and nineteenth-

Families and Firms • 217
century technology favored large-scale activity, and in two main ways: by
enabling standardization through precision engineering and by harness-
ing the greater energy eﬃciency of single large machines, whether these
were steamships or railroads or factory equipment. The later develop-
ments of electricity and telecommunications in the early twentieth cen-
tury had a more ambiguous eﬀect: production no longer had to take place
near the customer and thus could be concentrated in a few small centers,
but at the same time, small workshop activity no longer had to cluster
around sources of power and information and thus could compete eﬀec-
tively with larger hubs of production. Alfred Chandler has emphasized,
though, that there was nothing automatic about the beneﬁts from scale.
First, producing at large scale makes sense only if you face large markets
(American ﬁrms in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were obvi-
ously in a better position than those in other countries). Even if you do,
investing in large-scale production facilities is worthwhile only if you
have the management skills necessary to keep your factories running
at high capacity and the marketing skills necessary to reach the many
customers that are theoretically out there.26 What made Du Pont, Gen-
eral Motors, Standard Oil, Sears Roebuck, and U.S. Steel diﬀerent from
other less successful ﬁrms was not that they had diﬀerent technological
opportunities but rather that they had the organizational and managerial
capacity to exploit those opportunities to the full. They supplemented
the invisible hand of the market with the visible hand of management.
(The Visible Hand is the title of Chandler’’s best-known book).27 One con-
sequence of this was that many ﬁrms became large not simply because
they had large production plants but because the best way to ensure
high capacity for these plants was to integrate backward into raw mate-
rial production and forward into distribution and marketing.∗
The Visible Hand was published in 1977, ironically around the very
time that changing economic conditions were starting to reveal the limi-
tations in Chandler’s vision of American business.28 In the time since
then, more and more large ﬁrms, particularly in the traditional pro-
duction industries, have found themselves outperformed by smaller,
nimbler competitors. These competitors are more focused on certain
∗This trend was copied, usually disastrously, by central planners under communism,
who thought that vertical integration, including health services, holiday dachas, and the
farms producing food for the workers’ canteen, was a suﬃcient condition for eﬃcient
production. A Polish minister for industry in the early 1990s told me that the Nowa Huta
steelworks outside Cracow would need only to strengthen its perimeter fence to be able
to declare itself a separate state.

218 • Chapter 13
core activities and tend to coordinate with their suppliers in other ways
than through complete vertical integration. The reasons for this are
not simply technological. For instance, growing international trade and
increased competition at home have forced many ﬁrms to be more hard-
headed about which activities they undertake for themselves and which
they buy outside. In-house suppliers that can’t match the competition
are a luxury ﬁrms can increasingly ill aﬀord.
But technology matters too: the information revolution of the late
twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst centuries is having a powerful impact
on the structure of ﬁrms. To begin with, information technology makes
it possible to produce items to order, with highly individualized speci-
ﬁcations, without losing economies of scale. It also makes it possible to
supply a customer from any distance away, provided the customer and
the supplier can reach agreement at that distance as to what constitutes
acceptable quality. It works for software: much of the software for the
American banking industry is produced in India. It works for precision-
engineered components whose tolerance limits can be written down and
objectively tested (“objectively” means that the test can be performed in
Milan or Manila and still reach the same result). It works—up to a point—
for ﬁnancial services. It doesn’t work, though, for paintings, or for fresh
ﬁsh. Smoked salmon can be bought over the internet, but to buy the fresh
kind, you need to see it directly. Similarly, the internet works for most
books, but not for most clothes. It works—also up to a point—for cut
diamonds and diamond jewelery but hardly at all for rough diamonds,
which still need physical inspection to determine their natural charac-
teristics. On a day when I made the comparison, the most expensive of
over 68,000 polished diamonds or pieces of diamond jewelery for sale
on eBay had a price of $4 million, while the most expensive of a mere 101
rough diamonds had a price of only $299, a tiny fraction of the levels at
which some rough diamonds change hands at the De Beers sales (known
as “sights”) in London.
What exactly is revolutionary about the information revolution? Part
of what information technology brings to ﬁrms is the standardization
of procedures, enabling knowledge of their operation to be transmitted
from one individual to another without the painstaking apprenticeship
of the craft system at each stage in the chain. As I pointed out above,
this is certainly not a new phenomenon; it’s a good description of what
made the Roman army so much more powerful than its predecessors
and rivals. And the growth of the corporation in the late nineteenth cen-
tury was about exploiting exactly such standardization. But two features

Families and Firms • 219
of this process as we experience it today are new. First, we have learned
to standardize procedures that are more complex, more ﬂexible and of
a higher order—not just those required to fasten the nut to the bolt,
Chaplin-style, but those required to stop the entire production line and
retool it for a diﬀerent model of car, an operation that can now be carried
out very much faster than before. As a result, we can decentralize much
more sophisticated operations within a single ﬁrm than the pin-making
tasks described by Adam Smith, beneﬁting in the process from advan-
tages of motivation and adaptability without sacriﬁcing advantages of
scale.29 Secondly, this standardization of procedures is much more likely
to be recorded in reproducible, often digital form. This means that the
knowledge can be easily transmitted across ﬁrms and not just within
them, leading to more unstable and uncontrolled forms of competition.
To learn the Roman army’s procedures you had to be a Roman soldier,
whereas to copy a rival ﬁrm’s accounting system you just have to buy (or
pirate) its software. (Blueprints and chemical formulas have, of course,
performed a similar function for decades and even centuries, as systems
of patents and licenses have sought to recognize.)
Increasing digitization is making the boundaries of the corporation
more porous to valuable information. This can have powerful impacts
on the structure of ﬁrms and not just on what they do—for instance,
the use of on-board computers to monitor truck drivers and to com-
municate between trucks and their despatchers has led to a decline of
owner-operated trucks and a rise in the number trucking ﬁrms inde-
pendent of major manufacturers.30 Still, we should not exaggerate how
new this is. The invention of printing had exactly such an eﬀect on the
medieval church. The alphabet is itself a form of digitally encoding ideas,
but for as long as reproduction of books meant copying by hand in a
monastic scriptorium, the dissemination of these ideas had made little
progress outside the church that controlled the copying process and a
handful of wealthy laypeople who were in a position to own the product.
But printing allowed ideas to seep through the church’s walls to those
outside who owed the institution no particular loyalty—including to its
direct rivals in the market for ideas, namely the Protestant churches,
which were set up independently of the Roman Catholic church just as
trucking ﬁrms were to be set up independently many centuries later.
And since the dawn of history, technical inventions have often spread
through imitation far beyond the contexts in which they ﬁrst appeared.
The domestication of the horse and the development of wheeled chariots
transformed warfare across Europe and Asia during the third millennium

220 • Chapter 13
b.c.e.31 More prosaically, most of the beneﬁts from the invention of air
conditioning accrued not to the inventors or even to the manufacturers
of air-conditioning equipment but instead to the owners of real estate
in places such as Florida.32 Land proved ultimately much scarcer than
the know-how needed to replicate this valuable but relatively low-tech
process.
Nor should we exaggerate how much of our stock of useful know-
ledge can be transmitted across the globe at the click of a mouse. As was
pointed out in chapter 1, many procedures central to modern life will not
be mastered by information technology any time soon—cleaning a hotel
room and weeding a ﬂowerbed, to name but two. Information technology
still cannot tell you how to value a rough diamond, or whether that ﬁsh
smells really fresh, or whether you’re going to look good in that dress.
And many corporate cultures involve intangible qualities that prove
extremely resistant to imitation (though hope springs eternal, as shelf
after dreary shelf of business books in airports attest). Recent research
has shown that distance still matters to a large extent in the spread of
knowledge even in ﬁelds characterized by high scientiﬁc precision: the
use of licenses for inventions patented in American universities tends to
cluster closely around the sites where the inventions originated.33 The
explanation seems to be that there is no substitute for face-to-face con-
tact in transmitting some of the intangible components of knowledge
and skill—and without these intangible components even the tangible
ones will not work very well. Face-to-face contact, sometimes mediated
through a complex chain of responsibility and command, is what dis-
tinguishes the island of the ﬁrm from the sea of market transactions
around it.
Still, even if it sometimes seems as though nothing is truly new under
the sun, the cumulative eﬀect of many subtle changes can make a large
impact on the corporate landscape. If ﬁrms in many traditional produc-
tion industries have been slimming down and focusing on their core
activities, ﬁrms in some service industries and those where branding is
important have been growing very large. One force for size is the fact that
digital information can be almost costlessly reproduced. A ﬁrm such as
Microsoft can devote billions of dollars to developing the ﬁrst copy of
a software product, and then make millions more copies for no more
than the cost of producing a CD-Rom. This is useful if there are many
millions of potential users of the product, but useless if it is a highly spe-
cialized product with only a tiny niche of users. Another force for size is
the importance of networks: a credit card company relies on users being

Families and Firms • 221
able to ﬁnd outlets that will take their cards and on outlets being able to
ﬁnd users—and the value of such linked networks is increasing as peo-
ple travel further and more often across the world. A third force is the
power of branding: a visitor to a Sheraton hotel or a buyer of Coca-Cola
needs to feel conﬁdent that the service they receive or the liquid they
drink is recognizably similar to what they might have received from the
same brand on the other side of the world. And that in turn is credible
only if the ﬁrms that own these brands are large, coherent, and orga-
nized in a reliably uniform way. Staﬀin the Hong Kong Sheraton may
have trained in New York; the Coke sold in Africa may have been bottled
in France. As communications and broadcasting give a bigger share of
the world’s population access to a common pool of information, more
ﬁrms are ﬁnding that it pays to be large.
Nevertheless, at the same time that these forces are favoring size, mod-
ern technology is also playing a part in promoting diversity. The internet
may make more people aware of Sheraton Hotels but it also enables the
intelligent surfer to see that all hotels are not alike and that some reﬂect
a local spirit far better than any large chain could. When I travel to a dif-
ferent country on vacation, I want some things to be like what I have at
home: drinkable water, a reasonable level of hygiene, peace and quiet. But
there are other things I probably want to change: food, scenery, décor, the
ingredients of that elusive element called charm. A brand name is often
a crude signal: it promises reliability without diversity. So I may use the
internet to search for smaller local hotels. Not that branding becomes
irrelevant; on the contrary, some sites, like some series of travel guides,
specialize in what might be called “local branding,” in which they oﬀer
users an assurance that hotels will share a certain quality and charm
even though they express those attributes in diﬀerent ways. The point
about such branding is that if hotels wish to share the qualities of a
hotel chain, they need to belong to the same ﬁrm, or at least to a highly
organized franchise. If instead they wish merely to share a more elusive
character such as “charm,” it is enough for them to belong to the same
information network. Information technology, then, can help to make
some ﬁrms very large, but can bring to others the advantages of size
even when they stay small.
Firms and the Constraints of Their Environment
Let’s return, then, to the question with which this chapter began. What
makes some activities suitable for large ﬁrms and others suitable for

222 • Chapter 13
small ones? And can we really explain the growth of large corporations
as a phenomenon rooted in the underlying soil of economic life? Is it not
just an accident based on fashion, convention, or a quest for power by
those who run them? Few people who have ever set foot inside a modern
corporation would deny that the quest for power is a palpable motive
shaping people’s everyday lives. Executives thirst to command others
and burn with resentment at the slights that come from submitting to
the command of others; junior employees sometimes live out a kind of
prolonged adolescence in continued deference to their supervisors. And
there is ample evidence from more systematic studies, as well as from
journalistic reports, that takeovers and merger deals struck in company
boardrooms can be driven by greed, vanity, and the wish for power, the
desire to run a large ﬁrm (regardless of whether it is an eﬀective one), the
urge to be Number One, the need to belong to what investment bankers
call the “Bulge Bracket.” None of this should be surprising to anyone
familiar with the raw material of human nature. But though none of it
is surprising, none of it—surprisingly—may matter very much. The the-
atrical emotions may be speaking the lines, but larger economic forces
are writing the script.
Why? Greed, vanity, and the wish for power have always driven human
beings’ conquest of their natural environment, but that conquest has
often failed. Those who have succeeded have not necessarily been greed-
ier or more vain nor wished more ardently for power than those who
failed. They have simply adapted those motives more successfully to
the possibilities of the environment, including the environment created
by the motives of others. It’s the same in the business world. It’s not
the desire to run a large ﬁrm that makes you capable of doing so. It’s
not the thirst to take over a competitor, or to diversify your business
into new markets, that makes these strategies viable. Just as in nature,
the strategies need to match the opportunities aﬀorded by the environ-
ment. The big animals that wander the Serengeti may impress competi-
tors, or zoologists, or tourists, but they also consume huge quantities
of energy, and no large animal can survive unless its environment oblig-
ingly feeds it. That’s why so few of the world’s successfully adapted
animals are very large; and why the largest, like the dinosaurs, have
proved so vulnerable to environmental disruption; and why the most
favorable environments for large animals are to be found in the rela-
tively stable surroundings of the oceans. Big ﬁrms, likewise, consume
enormous quantities of resources just to keep running, and no large ﬁrm
can survive for long unless its environment—its owners, its customers,

Families and Firms • 223
its government—obligingly feeds it. Firms that have tried to grow too
large—Enron, Vivendi, WorldCom, Lehman Brothers—have often been
checked when the food supply dried up.
Sometimes, in spite of failing dismally to adapt to their environment,
ﬁrms survive through ﬁnding powerful individual backers. In the mid
1990s, a few years after the collapse of communism, I visited a factory
close to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev. I was used to visiting ﬁrms that
made a wide array of products, but even so this ﬁrm astonished me.
It made docking equipment for space stations. It made pine kitchen fur-
niture. It made plastic medical syringes. It made video arcade games. It
made aircraft. It made mining equipment. It made keyboards for per-
sonal computers. It made precision instruments. None of this was based
on any coherent vision, any idea of whether there were intrinsic com-
plementarities between the skills needed to make precision instruments
and those needed to make furniture. The ﬁrm made anything its team
of twelve hundred ingenious inventors felt like making, regardless of
whether anyone wanted to buy it. It had survived because the ﬁrm’s
director had excellent contacts in the Ministry for Industry, which for
several decades had been prepared to pour bad money after worse.
In the company of the director and several of his colleagues, I enjoyed
a lengthy discussion of the theories of economist John Sutton, who has
done more than any other modern researcher to document the diﬀerent
forces that make some ﬁrms grow while others stay small.34 “Surely it
makes sense for us to keep our aircraft division together with our pre-
cision instruments division,” said the director. “It’s all high-technology,
after all.” Sutton would have pointed out that this makes no more sense
than for a Bond Street tailor making made-to-measure suits to set up
shop in the entrance to Marks & Spencer, on the grounds that “it’s all
cloth.” For a Bond Street tailor has to deal with individual measurements
and requirements that vary subtly (or not so subtly) from one client to
another. Marks & Spencer can go for large-scale production, invest in
advertising, cut its prices, and put lots of identical items on the rails
in the knowledge that subtle diﬀerences need not matter, and that the
large amounts of money it has spent on the strategy will be justiﬁed
by the large number of extra customers the strategy will bring in. Both
strategies may make sense, but they are quite diﬀerent from each other,
and customers need to know which one they are getting. If I buy a suit
from Marks & Spencer, I may be able to ask for the trousers to be slightly
altered, but if I ask for too many alterations, I shall be politely directed to
go to a tailor. It’s the same with aerospace, which tends to make aircraft

224 • Chapter 13
in large numbers by throwing money at a design problem (like how to
transport several hundred people for several hundred miles at minimum
fuel cost). This is quite diﬀerent from precision instruments, which are
bespoke items designed for the precise needs of small numbers of indi-
vidual clients. Aircraft manufacturers are the big hunting mammals of
the industrial world, while precision instrument makers are the small
rodents, the opportunists. Neither could survive on the same diet as the
other.
Similar contrasts can be seen across the world. Aid workers and gov-
ernment oﬃcials in many poor countries have often expressed baﬄe-
ment and despair at the inability of government-subsidized banks and
credit schemes to displace the traditional moneylender from his place in
village life. But the moneylender is a rodent too, beneﬁting from informa-
tion about his borrowers more detailed than any bank could ever acquire,
adapting his strategy, his terms, and the availability of his funds to the
needs, circumstances, and weaknesses of his borrowers. The modern
bank, with its air-conditioned oﬃces, and computerized loan records,
has powerful skills, but it is a large mammal that occupies a quite diﬀer-
ent ecological niche. Neither looks remotely ready to displace the other.
My conversations in Ukraine also revealed a striking parallel between
the worlds of politics and business. Under communism, Ukrainian ﬁrms
were run along autocratic lines, as beﬁtted their tsarist political origins.
An individual director might be good or bad, plodding or inspired, but
what he said (and it was almost always “he”) was the law for his ﬁrm.
Firms in America or Western Europe, by contrast, are coalitions, prod-
ucts of the eighteenth-century political theory of checks and balances
that underlies the American Constitution. Standing behind the inspired
inventor is an accountant asking what it will cost, or a marketing direc-
tor asking how anyone will ever be persuaded to buy it, or a personnel
director asking what will be the impact on the workforce. These are frus-
trating voices for the creative thinker or inventor to hear, and it’s some-
times tempting to think that modern society would be better oﬀwithout
them. Inventors and entrepreneurs can often be seen on television or
in the letters columns of newspapers bemoaning the pettifogging con-
straints of bankers, accountants, and bureaucrats that stop them from
taking their creativity to truly inspiring heights. They deserve just as
much skepticism as politicians who bemoan the constraints placed on
them by advisors, bureaucrats, and voters. A look at the mess made in
that factory in Kiev is enough to dispel this fantasy.

Families and Firms • 225
Many of the most spectacular corporate failures in modern times have
been produced by great creative individuals who overreached them-
selves, in part because the normal restraining mechanisms of the mod-
ern ﬁrm failed to work. Just as the sensory capacities of a large mammal
enable it to see, or hear, or scent danger before the danger arrives, and
thereby check the urge to act on the impulses of hunger or libido, so the
checks and balances of a modern corporation are means to sense disas-
ter before it arrives, and thereby restrain the urge to act on an impulse,
even a great and creative impulse. When a corporation’s internal checks
begin to fail, its days are as surely numbered as those of a large hunting
mammal whose scent or hearing fades. And the larger it is, the faster it
will run out of fuel for its daily metabolic needs.
So the answer to the question at the beginning of this chapter is clear.
Groups of strangers can sometimes collaborate to perform the ordinary
productive tasks of modern life, but large groups will predominate over
small groups only when they have a strategy better adapted to their
environment. Brute force and ambition are never enough. Only when the
environment demands large-scale coordination, using skills that can be
transmitted within an organization through personal contact more eﬀec-
tively (with lower “transactions costs”) than through the anonymity of
markets and information networks, will large groups enjoy a systematic
advantage over small ones. Otherwise they will fall victim to the suspi-
cion that is endemic between strangers, and that dates back to the very
origin of our species.
Modern corporations are not the only organizations to coordinate the
division of labor outside markets. Charities, Maﬁa organizations, govern-
ment departments, churches, ethnic networks, and armies all do some-
thing recognizably similar. As we saw at the start of the chapter, the
large ﬁrm is a relatively modern invention, and it has enjoyed its remark-
able success only because it has proved extremely eﬀective at creating,
absorbing, and transmitting knowledge and skill from one person to
another. For much of human history since the dawn of agriculture—for
perhaps nine and a half of the last ten millennia—control of knowledge
remained the prerogative of generals, priests, and (more recently) master
craftsmen. As we shall see in chapter 14, the escape of knowledge from
the exclusive control of these groups is what has enabled the division of
labor to take such an elaborate, prosperous, and dangerous form in the
modern world.

Knowledge and Symbolism
The First Symbolic Artifacts
Late one Sunday afternoon in 1994, a week before Christmas, three
friends were coming to the end of an afternoon’s potholing in the
Ardèche in southern France. In a small cavity in the rock, a site well-
known to cavers and walkers, they stumbled across an opening that led
to a passage widening out into a large, empty space. They would need
further equipment to continue, which would mean adjourning to their
car, but it was already night and they were tired. Once back at the car,
they nearly decided not to return, but when they did, they discovered a
series of passages linking vast chambers, the whole site extending over
several hundred meters. One of the trio, Eliette Brunel, spotted a small
painting of a mammoth in red ochre on a piece of hanging rock. Alerted
by this discovery, they searched the walls and discovered hundreds of
paintings and rock carvings, some of them of extraordinary energy and
sophistication. Although they did not realize it at the time, the oldest
of these paintings date back a little over thirty thousand years, mak-
ing them twice the age of the famous cave paintings in Lascaux. In one
evening they had extended our understanding of the origins of human
culture back in time by many millennia.
The Chauvet cave (named after the expedition’s leader, Jean-Marie
Chauvet) has now attained worldwide fame and is a central point of ref-
erence for those wishing to understand human evolution.1 The really
surprising thing about the Chauvet paintings, though, is not that such
remarkable works of art should have been created so long ago, but rather
that we have not found more of them. Those who made these paintings
and carvings were clearly beings with both imagination and skill; they
had a capacity for symbolic representation and a curiosity about their
world for which there is absolutely no evidence among any earlier Euro-
pean peoples. Evidence of tool-making has been found in archeological
sites well over a million years old, but if stone tools were useful, they

Knowledge and Symbolism • 227
were very far from being creative. For most of that million-year span,
stone tools showed a tedious lack of variety, of adaptability to local
materials, or of evolution over time.2 The earliest human beings went
on ﬂaking and chipping in exactly the same way that their ancestors did,
with no learning apart from the acquisition of the same ancient skill,
no accumulation of collective knowledge or experience. Nor did humans
show any signs of gradual experimentation with culture—with pictures,
artworks, or personal decoration—or evidence of natural or metaphys-
ical curiosity. When these interests arrived, they seem to have done so
very suddenly.
The likely explanation of their sudden arrival in Europe is not, in fact,
that they suddenly evolved. Instead, they almost certainly evolved else-
where, namely, in Africa; like many of the creative members of any soci-
ety, the master artists of the Chauvet cave were probably recent immi-
grants, at least as measured in evolutionary time.3 Over forty thousand
years ago, people living in the cave of Enkapune Ya Muto, or “Twilight
cave,” in East Africa’s Rift Valley, carved ostrich egg shells into delicate
beads, which they may have used to exchange with others as symbols
of reciprocity in the same way that !Kung San tribesmen in the Kalahari
Desert of Botswana do today.4 Stones engraved with patterns, found in a
cave called Blombos in South Africa, have been dated even earlier, to sev-
enty thousand years ago or more, leading some archeologists to claim
that a capacity for modern cultural behavior may have evolved grad-
ually over many tens, and possibly some hundreds, of millennia. The
suddenness of the break in the archeological record may owe more to
the accidents of preservation and discovery than to any suddenness in
the developments it records.
This interpretation of the evidence is highly controversial, not least
because no one can do more than speculate whether such a revolutionary
development in human behavioral capacities could possibly have been
the result of a relatively slight adjustment in the anatomical microstruc-
ture of the human brain. Brains leave no fossils; only skulls do, and
the skulls of the ﬁrst culturally modern humans were no diﬀerent from
those of their cultureless immediate predecessors. There is also much
argument among specialists about how precisely to describe the mental
capacities that were necessary for human beings to develop culture in
this way. Susan Blackmore, for example, argues in her book The Meme
Machine that all that was needed was an ability to imitate others, an
ability that makes us very diﬀerent from other animals and that, once
acquired, set oﬀan unstoppable ﬂood of copying that has led our ideas

228 • Chapter 14
and institutions to take on lives of their own. Michael Tomasello argues
in The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition that the capacity to imitate
to the extent that we do itself requires other skills—notably an ability to
project ourselves into the point of view of other people.
What is not controversial, though, is how revolutionary this develop-
ment was; it made possible the whole future of human culture. To see
why, think of it as combining two preexisting elements in human behav-
ior: symbolic representation and the creation of physical artifacts.5 Each
of these elements was remarkable enough in its own right, but they
had a truly startling potential in combination. Symbolic representation
means the use of signs for communication, signs whose reference to the
external world is potentially arbitrary but whose meaning depends on
and is reinforced by social convention. The signs used by modern man
could and did draw upon pictorial representation, but their potential
for recombination in new and unexpected ways gave them a ﬂuidity and
expressiveness far surpassing any mechanical copying of nature: one of
the paintings in the Chauvet cave is of a creature with the head and torso
of a bison and the legs of a human being. Symbolic reasoning radically
transformed the ability of human beings to communicate information
about their world, allowing them to represent past and future events as
well as present ones, imaginary events as well as real ones, general ideas
as well as brute instances, hopes and fears and dreams as well as cries
and demands.
Symbolism as such almost certainly long predates modern man: lan-
guage, after all, uses arbitrary sounds to refer to objects,6 and anatomical
evidence suggests that our probable ancestors (such as Homo ergaster)
and cousins (such as Homo neanderthalis) must have spoken languages
that served complex social purposes.7 These languages would have
involved arbitrary systems of signs: when Neanderthal man told Nean-
derthal woman that he had seen two mammoths, he must have uttered
sounds that were neither binary nor mammothlike. But the symbolism of
Neanderthal man vanished into the air as soon as it was uttered; it left
no physical traces and gave subsequent generations only the shifting
sands of memory on which to build. What made symbolism revolution-
ary was its embodiment in physical artifacts, manufactured objects that
could outlast the behavior that created them and even the life span of
their creator. Of course, artifacts as such were not new either. Stone tools
are artifacts—very complex ones, which even today require long training
and a high degree of skill to reproduce. But the stone tools of premod-
ern man had absolutely no symbolic content. What made the cognitive

Knowledge and Symbolism • 229
revolution we see in the Twilight cave and the Chauvet cave so remark-
able was that it combined these two features. For the ﬁrst time in the
story of humanity, artifacts that were also symbols appeared. For the
ﬁrst, time man could leave his descendants objects with a meaning, one
that would make his own ideas live after him.
The ability to learn from those who have preceded us is at the heart
of the story of humanity. Anthropologists sometimes use the term “cul-
ture” to mean any kind of behavior that is learned and that diﬀers from
one community to another for no other reason than historical accident.
In this sense some nonhuman animals have culture too: for instance,
zoologists working with chimpanzees have identiﬁed some kinds of for-
aging behavior that varies between troops in exactly this way.8 Neverthe-
less, culture in the sense of a collective store of ideas that can be used to
meet various challenges in our lives, without all having to be learned and
absorbed in advance, is a uniquely human phenomenon. One of the fea-
tures that distinguished anatomically modern man from his forerunners
was a signiﬁcantly longer life span, and it seems likely that the female
menopause evolved around the same time.9 Both developments greatly
increased the probability that grandchildren would have access to grand-
parents and other senior adults who were not directly preoccupied with
raising children of their own. In this way the memories of these adults
could serve as a repository of knowledge to help the tribe meet the chal-
lenges of an unpredictable environment. But, on its own, such an oral
encyclopedia was perishable and short-lived. It took symbolic artifacts
to put culture on a more lasting footing.
Symbolic artifacts oﬀer several major advantages over a purely oral
culture. They are typically more durable than brain tissue. They can be
shared: many people may look at a picture or read an inscription (these
have some of the features of what economists call “public goods”). As
a result any single individual has access to a vastly greater library of
ideas than she could ever store in her own brain. And ﬁnally, the fact
that symbols can be recombined in new and unexpected ways allows
their users to experiment, to invent as well as to record their inventions
for future users. This “cognitive ﬂuidity,” as archeologist Steven Mithen
has called it, may have been responsible for the invention of agriculture,
through allowing human beings to fashion a new relationship with the
animals and plants they had previously gone out to hunt. At any rate,
it is remarkable that after some millions of years of human evolution,
agriculture should have been invented independently in at least seven
diﬀerent places in the world only a few thousand years after the ﬁrst

230 • Chapter 14
symbolic artifacts were created. Although it has been plausibly argued
that other factors, such as climate change, were involved, there had been
radical climate changes before that had not produced so radical a shift
in human behavior. It could be coincidence, but it is far more likely that
one invention (symbolic artifacts) facilitated the other (agriculture) once
the ecological conditions were suitable.
For the ﬁrst time in human evolution, then, symbolic artifacts allowed
knowledge to become both collective and cumulative. The greatest inven-
tions are those that make it easier for others to become inventive in
turn. The invention of writing is almost certainly another example of
multiple independent invention, one that occurred a little over ﬁve thou-
sand years ago in as many as ﬁve widely separated parts of the world:
Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, Pakistan, and Central America. It made pos-
sible a vast range of subsequent inventions that depended on writing
for their expression, their dissemination, and possibly even their con-
ception. The invention of printing by Johannes Gutenberg around 1450
looks more like a single formative event, though even this took place
at a time of parallel developments (both in Europe and in China) that
suggest printing would soon have been invented even if Gutenberg had
never lived. Its impact was extraordinary, and not just for the immedi-
ate beneﬁts it brought to those newly able to aﬀord books. As historian
Elizabeth Eisenstein has written: “In 1483, the Ripoli Press charged three
ﬂorins per quinterno for setting up and printing Ficino’s translation of
Plato’s Dialogues. A scribe might have charged one ﬂorin per quinterno
for duplicating the same work. The Ripoli Press produced 1,025 copies;
the scribe would have turned out one.” The cost of making books had
fallen to around one three-hundredth of what it had been a few years
before.10
Some of the many new readers who would have access to books as
a result would just read for their own pleasure and instruction. Others
would be inspired by their reading to further invention. For instance,
to cite Eisenstein again, the astronomers Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, and
Johannes Kepler “had an opportunity to survey a wider range of records
and to use more reference guides than any astronomer before.” Others
again would use the invention as a means of founding businesses, like
William Caxton, who in 1476 set up England’s ﬁrst printing press (on
which he printed not only the Bible but also the ﬁrst popular edition
of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales). Even if the original motive was busi-
ness rather than further invention, Caxton’s subsequent contributions

Knowledge and Symbolism • 231
to spelling and editing played a large part in the growing standardiza-
tion of the English language.
In our own time, the fact that symbolic artifacts can multiply a thou-
sand- or a millionfold the power of a single idea has had striking implica-
tions for the rewards that accrue to those who have ideas that others ﬁnd
useful or attractive. Some people, like Bill Gates, can become billionaires
because their ideas can be copied: genius is less than 1 per cent inspi-
ration, more than 99 per cent replication. Similarly, although musicians
worry about the eﬀect of copying on the rewards for their work, it is only
since copying of musical performances became possible that some musi-
cians have become seriously rich. Prior to the twentieth century, musi-
cians relied for their rewards on the audiences for their performances,
which limited the number of paying admirers to those who could be ﬁt-
ted into a single concert hall. One or two became prosperous through
royal patronage, like Jean-Baptiste Lully, who worked for King Louis XIV
of France. Others of great creativity could barely scrape a living: Mozart
died a pauper. Now musicians of microscopic talent compared to Mozart
are multimillionaires, and complain when copies of their songs are down-
loaded free on the internet. In fact, the evidence is strong that ideas feed
the demand for more ideas—as any website manager knows, you will
never get people to subscribe for content if you don’t give some pretty
interesting content away for free. The invention of video recorders did
not impoverish, but rather has massively enriched, the studios of Holly-
wood, which now earn more from DVD rentals than from ticket sales. It
is similarly unlikely that improved copying technology will impoverish
the music industry any time soon.
What it will certainly do, though, is to increase spectacularly the gap
between the rewards enjoyed by the people whose talents appeal (for
whatever reason) to many people and the rewards enjoyed by those
whose talents appeal to relatively few.11 As the economist Robert Frank
describes the process:
Winner-take-all markets have proliferated in part because technology
has greatly extended the power and reach of the planet’s most gifted
performers. At the turn of the century, when the state of Iowa alone had
more than 1,300 opera houses, thousands of tenors earned adequate, if
modest livings performing before live audiences. Now that most music
we listen to is prerecorded, however, the world’s best tenor can be lit-
erally everywhere at once. And since it costs no more to stamp out
compact discs from Luciano Pavarotti’s master recording than from a
less renowned tenor’s most of us now listen to Pavarotti. Millions of us

232 • Chapter 14
are each willing to pay a little extra to hear him rather than other singers
who are only marginally less able or well-known; and this explains why
Pavarotti earns several millions of dollars a year even as most other
tenors, many of them nearly as talented, struggle to get by.12
Not all the rewards of creativity are ﬁnancial. Some people become less
rich than opera stars but nevertheless attract the esteem and admira-
tion of others (esteem being a way in which we reward those who have
done things for us that we value more than the market does). As print-
ing increased the audience for books (and reproducible artworks such
as engravings) in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries,
more attention came to be focused on the notion of the individual liter-
ary or artistic genius. The quality of the symbolic artifact came to count
for more than the sum total of the actions of the person that produced
it. This was understandable, given that the former was much more long-
lived and had much more direct inﬂuence on other people than the latter.
Indeed, by a kind of reverse logic, the idea that individual artists might
have messy, unfocused, unaesthetic lives came to be seen almost as the
touchstone of their artistic authenticity, as though it were a proof of the
perfection of the artifact that it could only come to birth at a supreme
culminating moment in an individual life. It is a curious ﬂowering of
the notion of spiritual attainment that had its roots in the ancient and
medieval injunction to people to fashion their whole lives to the glory of
God.
Trust between Generations
Thanks to the collective and cumulative knowledge made possible by
symbolic artifacts, individual human beings can undertake challenges
unimaginable to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. As we have seen in ear-
lier chapters, the possibilities open to humanity have vastly expanded
because of the division of labor. But even a single modern, educated
individual trying to survive unaided on a desert island would in some
respects fare much better than one of our hunter-gatherer ances-
tors. He would lack the extensive knowledge a hunter-gatherer would
have learned from his living elders—and on occasion such knowledge
might prove critical for his survival. Indeed, hunting and gathering are
extremely cognitively challenging tasks, much more so than many mod-
ern industrial occupations. He might also ﬁnd that the habits of depend-
ing on others for the supply of the goods needed for his daily exis-
tence were too diﬃcult to unlearn. But he would have the accumulated

Knowledge and Symbolism • 233
knowledge of many generations of those no longer living, transmitted
through the symbolic artifacts of cultural exchange. If he survived the
initial challenges he would be able to avoid many of the false starts,
painful experiences, and deadly traps that lay in wait for our ancestors.
Conversely, what hunter-gatherers parachuted into modern life would
require in order to cope with its challenges would be not just a capacity
to share tasks as elaborately as we do but also the cultural and intel-
lectual inheritance of the generations that have preceded us and which
frees us from the need to make every invention anew. To put the mat-
ter another way, symbolic artifacts enable an elaborate division of labor
across generations and not just within them.
In a similar way to the division of labor within generations, therefore,
the use of symbolic artifacts also requires an element of trust—trust
in the strangers who will interpret our communications in the future.
We saw in earlier chapters how trust in modern societies is no longer
just a matter of personal psychology, of how you feel about a particu-
lar individual. More fundamentally, it is about the set of social institu-
tions that make it reasonable to trust someone enough to exchange with
them, regardless of how you feel about them personally. These institu-
tions comprise the law, the mechanisms for enforcing the law, and a
whole range of conventions—informal habits and incentives that, taken
together, give us a reason to predict the trustworthy behavior of others
with an acceptable level of conﬁdence. To the extent that these aﬀect the
degree of conﬁdence that a person can have in the contractual promises
made by others, such factors make up what we can call the system of
property rights in a society. In a similar way, the exercise of symbolic
communication is subject to property rights. To use this terminology
sounds less strange once we reﬂect that the purpose of such rights is to
enhance our trust in those who will interpret our communications. For
trust is of importance to us in a variety of ways, and it will aﬀect the
kinds of symbolic communication we are willing to make. And when we
look more closely, we see that property rights in symbolic communica-
tion have a number of features that make them even more complex than
property rights in ordinary physical things.
Take a simple example. Build a better mousetrap, said Emerson, and
the world will beat a path to your door, though you build your house
in the woods. Suppose I do just that, but my mousetrap is not a piece
of elaborate machinery that I must make for you but rather a simple
idea that you could implement yourself at a cost much lower than the
total beneﬁt to you. I may reasonably think that since my idea beneﬁts

234 • Chapter 14
you I should obtain some share of that beneﬁt. Indeed, the days I may
have spent dreaming up the better mousetrap may have been motivated
precisely by the vision of the world’s beating a path to my door—my
own problems with mice may be rather minor by comparison. What can
I do to ensure that you give me some of the beneﬁt you receive from my
invention?
In theory, perhaps, I could just sell the idea to you. But that suggestion
is more complicated than it sounds, for how can I describe the idea to
you with suﬃcient precision for you to know whether it is worth buying,
without revealing the idea to you for free? This problem has been recog-
nized in the public system of intellectual property rights, embodied in
the laws on patents, copyright, and trademarks. The basic philosophy is
simple. I may be wary of describing the idea of my mousetrap to you, for
you may then announce that it is not worth buying, while secretly using
it all the same. But suppose I could describe it to a trusted third party,
who would ensure that my idea is not trivial, and is genuinely mine, and
will exercise some sanctions against you if you use it without paying me.
I may be willing to trust such a third party even if I have my doubts
about trusting you. The patent oﬃce is just such a third party. It acts as
an intermediary between those who have ideas and those who wish to
use the ideas of others.
Suppose I succeed in patenting my idea, so that others cannot copy it;
they must buy the mousetrap that I make and that embodies my idea.
The world beats a path to my door and I now become very rich. But I
may choose to set a high price that makes me a monopoly proﬁt while
denying the product to many potential buyers who could aﬀord the cost
of making more mousetraps. Alternatively, although my idea may have
been a stroke of genius, I may just not be very good at turning it into a
functioning product. My mousetraps may break down more often than if
I had sold the rights of manufacture to someone else. A third possibility
is that my mousetrap works just ﬁne, but not nearly as well as it might
work if someone else were to improve the idea by adding a truly revolu-
tionary improvement of their own. In each of these cases, the property
right has rewarded me comfortably for my invention, but at the cost of
restricting the transmission of my idea to others. Does this matter, or
is it the necessary price a society must pay for the establishment of the
institution of trust in the development of ideas?
Until recently most economists and lawyers would have given a fairly
simple answer to this question. Monopoly rights over ideas are indeed a
cost, but a necessary cost, of giving incentives to people to produce ideas

Knowledge and Symbolism • 235
in the ﬁrst place. After all, most inventions require a large investment of
time and resources; the majority don’t come serendipitously to the mind
of the inventor, as (perhaps) the idea for my mousetrap did. Without
the prospect of monopoly rights, people would stop trying to invent
and would do something less useful instead. But precisely because they
are a cost, the system of patent rights is restricted in time: patents are
typically granted for twenty years, no longer. Furthermore, the costs of
my monopoly power consist just in the number of mousetraps I refuse
to manufacture in order to keep the price high by restricting supply.
There’s no reason to fear that I shall hold on to my idea when it would
be better to sell the idea to someone else who could either manufacture
it or improve it better than I could. I can license my patent to another
user. And if the other user has a better use for it than I have, I will
license the patent, since that other user will be able to pay me more than
I would have earned by holding on to it myself. I have every interest, so
the argument goes, in the development of better ideas, better versions,
than my own. Such better ideas don’t compete with mine, but rather
enhance them, make them more valuable. If I know what is good for me,
I shall encourage their development.
So indeed the argument goes. But the evidence from history is, to say
the least, ambiguous on this point, for many innovators have sought to
restrict the further development of their ideas. It took the end of Richard
Arkwright’s patent on the water frame for other inventors to set to work
to improve it and incorporate it into related inventions; the most impor-
tant improvements to James Watt’s steam engine had to wait for his
patents to expire.13 Neither of these two great inventors showed much
interest in letting others improve on their work, even when these oth-
ers were willing to pay to do so. Earlier, the Roman Catholic Church had
made great eﬀorts to restrict the circulation of printed books, notably
through the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. These eﬀorts were ultimately
unsuccessful, because they caused a ﬂight of intellectuals and their ideas
to Protestant countries. In Elizabeth Eisenstein’s words, “the inﬂux of
religious refugees into Calvin’s Geneva in the 1550s radically altered the
professional structure of the city. The number of printers and book-
sellers jumped from somewhere between three and six to some three
hundred or more … Geneva gained at the French expense.”
In more recent times, the United States Government alleged, and the
American courts upheld, that Microsoft Corporation had sought to block
development of the web browser software Netscape Navigator, in spite
of the fact that this software would in principle only enhance the value

236 • Chapter 14
of the Windows operating system to which it was added as an appli-
cation. Indeed, the vigorous development of the software industry in
recent years is evidence (as economists Adam Jaﬀe and Josh Lerner
have argued)14 that property rights can sometimes block rather than
encourage innovation. Patents and copyrights play only a minor role
in the software industry; as soon as an important innovation appears,
other innovators set to work to try to improve it, rather than waiting
twenty years for patents to expire. Similar things happen in other indus-
tries, like ﬁnancial services, where innovation is vigorous and continuous
although intellectual property rights play virtually no role. In pharma-
ceuticals, by contrast, patent protection plays an important role, and the
extent of innovation does appear to respond to the strength of the pro-
tection the patent system confers.15 In the nineteenth century innova-
tions were vigorous in some industries like textiles and food processing
even without the help of patents, while in others (such as machinery
for agricultural and manufacturing) the extent of innovation appears to
have depended considerably on the strength of patent protection in the
country concerned.16 It wasn’t a matter of how advanced the innova-
tions were—innovation in scientiﬁc instruments needed little help from
patents. The reasons why patents were important for some activities but
apparently unimportant for others were, and still remain, very hard to
understand.
Although at ﬁrst sight it might seem strange that those who have new
ideas should seek to block the ideas of others that apparently enhance
their own, the Catholic Church (like James Watt, Richard Arkwright, and
perhaps Microsoft, if the U.S. government’s suspicions were correct) may
have had a better grasp of its own long-term interests than the conven-
tional argument gives it credit for. Ideas that build on mine and enhance
them today may return to challenge them tomorrow—that is not just
an unfortunate accident but inherent to the nature of symbolic commu-
nication, with its ﬂexibility and its potential for recombining symbols
in new and unexpected ways. The Catholic Church understood only too
well that a widespread readership even for orthodox works would create
a pool of educated outsiders from which heresy might one day return
strengthened to challenge the ideas by which it had ﬁrst been nour-
ished. Microsoft may have feared that even if Netscape’s web browser
enhanced the value of Windows today, it might develop into a substitute
for Windows in the future. Indeed, a number of scholars have recently
proposed explanations for the otherwise puzzling wish of some ﬁrms to
block complementary developments of their existing products in terms

Knowledge and Symbolism • 237
of a fear that these developments will provide a springboard for future
inventors to challenge those products themselves.17 The key to this fear
is symbolic recombination.
Suppose I have a monopoly over the manufacture of a product with a
low level of symbolic complexity: anvils, say, or railway lines. Then any-
thing that improves the quality of other goods that are complementary to
my monopoly product—horseshoes and railway services, respectively—
will be good news for me, because it will increase the willingness of
people to buy my anvils (or railway lines). I may even have an interest
in encouraging inventors of new types of horseshoe (or developers of
innovative kinds of railway service). Perhaps I give them free access to
my monopoly product while they are working on their inventions. Sim-
ilarly, if I have a monopoly on the production of electricity, I shall be
delighted to see inventors develop refrigerators and washing machines,
and may even give them cheap electricity to help them to do so; every
new power-thirsty invention will give an upward nudge to the demand
for my electricity. In each case, the low level of symbolic complexity of
my own product makes it extremely unlikely that such generosity will
rebound upon me, by giving rise to substitute anvils, alternatives to rail-
ways lines, or refrigerators that generate their own electricity. But when-
ever the symbolic content of my product is high, that is exactly what I
shall fear; the possibilities for symbolic recombination are so rich. My
ideas may spawn others that turn on their own progenitors.
The human brain’s capacity for symbolic tinkering is capable of rein-
terpreting ideas in a startling and sometimes frightening range of ways.
Engineers see in airplanes a triumph of technological coordination
and a soaring of the human spirit; psychoanalysts see them as fanta-
sized penises. Some poets and isolated preindustrial peoples have seen
them as giant birds, while Japanese wartime strategists and present-day
Islamic fundamentalists have looked at the same masses of metal and
seen them as bombs. The human mind’s capacity for creating poetry is
also what has made it so clever at plotting ambush.
By deﬁnition, innovators are those who have not been deterred from
expressing their ideas in the form of symbolic artifacts. When the ﬁrst
cave painters daubed shapes by ﬁrelight onto the walls of the caves of
Chauvet, Altamira, or Lascaux, did they fear that one day enemies might
use them as evidence of habitation, with which to track down and kill the
artists or their descendants? When warriors ﬁrst used wheels to make
chariots, were they deterred by the thought that their enemies would
soon copy their ingenuity and come thundering against them in chariots

238 • Chapter 14
of their own? When the U.S. Department of Defense ﬁrst developed elec-
tronic mail, did it foresee that one day terrorists plotting to attack the
United States would use this technology to coordinate their plans? The
evidence of successful creativity is all around us, and it may seem on
this evidence that the problem of trust between generations has, in this
respect at least, been solved, for innovation has been rapid, and accel-
erating, in recent centuries. But if we focus exclusively on this fact, we
may overlook the more subtle fact that innovators have often sought
to restrict the subsequent dissemination of their own ideas. How fast
innovation takes place will be critical to mankind’s ability in the coming
century to solve problems that are not standing still, problems such as
poverty, disease, and terrorism. So it becomes critical to ask: How well
do our systems of intellectual property cope with the problem of inter-
generational trust? Do they do enough to make the knowledge of each
generation of humanity available to its successors?
Protecting Things, Protecting Ideas
One way of reacting to the evidence that innovators often block the dis-
semination of their own ideas is to challenge the very idea that intel-
lectual property should be protected. Economists Michele Boldrin and
David Levine have made the radical proposal that society should recog-
nize no property rights at all in ideas as such.18 Property rights, they
suggest, should belong to the world of exchangeable things—many of
which, of course, embody ideas. The more powerful the idea embod-
ied in an object, the more valuable it will be to copy, but that is to the
advantage, not the disadvantage, of the person who owns the object. For
instance, the more people who will eventually want to listen to copies of
my new CD, the greater the price I can extract from the ﬁrst purchaser,
who will then enjoy the right to make (and sell) as many copies as he or
she desires.
In fact, it is not hard to show that even in a world in which there were no
intellectual property rights at all, and the law protected only the owner-
ship of physical objects, creators might be able to receive the full rewards
of their creativity. For this to happen, though, requires some quite spe-
cial circumstances. Imagine I have discovered a new drug that has some
remarkable properties. It reverses aging, turns frogs into princes, and
cures cancer, all three.19 Not everyone will value these properties equally,
but the drug is nevertheless very valuable indeed. Now imagine that all
the possible users of the drug are lined up in an order that reﬂects how

Knowledge and Symbolism • 239
much they value the drug. To the left are the elderly frogs with cancer,
to the far right are the healthy young princes. The person at the very far
right is someone who values the drug only just fractionally above the
cost of producing it and would therefore pay no more than this cost. To
his left stands someone who values it a little more. How much would
he pay? He would pay as much as it is worth to him, plus what he can
get for reselling it to the last person in the line. The person next to him
would likewise pay what it is worth to him, plus what he might get for
reselling it to the person on his right. Adding up along the line, we can
see that the ﬁrst buyer should be willing to pay a sum up to the total of all
the values that the buyers in the line attach to taking the drug. In other
words, simply by respecting property rights in the physical object with-
out separately protecting property rights in the idea, it should be possible
to reward the innovators with the full value of what they have created.
Like the Coase theorem, which we met in chapter 11, this argument is
of course a fantasy rather than a realistic proposal (in fact, the argument
is really just an instance of the Coase theorem in another guise). But it
is an instructive fantasy, for it helps to draw attention to the particular
obstacles that real life places in the way of innovators. One reason why
this kind of sequential bargain could not work in reality is that when I
invent my drug, I may have diﬃculty knowing who are the people who
value it most (people do not come neatly sorted into lines according
to their need for the drug).20 Another is that even if I could organize
an auction to ﬁnd out who valued it most, it would require a separate
auction to transfer each unit of the drug to the next buyer in the ﬁctional
line, and by the time these had all been conducted, even the healthy
young princes might have died of cancer, old age, or mad frog disease. A
third problem is that buyers in each auction might not know how much
to bid until they had learned enough about the drug’s characteristics to
be in a good position to make a pirate copy of it themselves. A fourth
problem is that some buyers in the auction might be dissuaded from
bidding their true value for the drug by the hope of waiting until its price
had come down in a later auction. In short, it’s unlikely that, without
at least some protection for ideas, innovators could ever realistically
hope to receive the full value of their innovations to all their users. That
is the understanding on which the admittedly imperfect institution of
intellectual property is based.
Nevertheless, even with these obstacles the fact remains that the eas-
ier it is to copy my drug (and therefore the more patients can potentially
beneﬁt from taking it), the greater, in principle, are the rewards I should

240 • Chapter 14
be able to reap for having invented it. This is a lesson that should be
borne in mind when ﬁrms complain that they are unable to enforce
patent rights in some developing countries. The very possibility of
exporting to developing countries at all increases the rewards to be made
from selling their products, so increased trade beneﬁts innovators, even
if not always by as much as they think they deserve. Indeed, the greater
ease of communications across the world has done much to raise the
rewards of innovation. Just as satellite dishes make it easier for interna-
tionally recognized brands to extend their global reach, so telephones,
faxes, email, and the internet have all increased the ease with which prod-
ucts, processes, and business methods can diﬀuse across national fron-
tiers. Not all of the eﬀects of this are positive, but overall the returns to
both innovation and the adoption of the innovations of others are likely
to rise.
Intellectual property is best understood, therefore, as an institution—
combining a set of formal laws, such as patent and copyright laws, with
a set of social conventions, such as those governing scientiﬁc citations—
that tries to increase our trust in the willingness of others to reward us
for our valuable ideas. Assuring us of the complete and unconditional
ownership of our ideas would be too extreme a way to do this, since we
might do too little to spread the ideas to others. Denying us any own-
ership of our ideas would also be too extreme: it would encourage the
spreading of such ideas as we chose to develop but would make us reluc-
tant to develop them in the ﬁrst place. (Imagine if the contents of your
personal diary and your digital camera were instantly posted on an open-
access website as soon as they were created—would you not be more cau-
tious about what you wrote and photographed?) The balance we strike
between these two will always be imperfect, will work better in some cir-
cumstances than in others, and will in any case need to evolve over time.
But when thinking about the right way to strike that balance, we need to
remember not just the trust that is its purpose but also how many of our
other social institutions have that trust among their intended or unin-
tended consequences. And many of the other institutions of our modern
social life need also to be understood as vehicles for the propagation of
ideas.
Ideas and the Shaping of Modern Institutions
In fact, what Boldrin and Levine have proposed—protect things, not
ideas—is no more than many innovators have been doing informally for

Knowledge and Symbolism • 241
centuries, and in this idea lies the key to understanding the growth of the
modern ﬁrm. Much more important to the growth of ideas than the for-
mal protection of the patent system has been a combination of two kinds
of informal protection. The ﬁrst is to embody ideas in things—or, even
better, in organizations and institutions. As we saw in chapter 13, what
makes ﬁrms a distinct alternative to markets as a way of organizing the
complex task-sharing of modern society is that ﬁrms are able to transmit
certain kinds of knowledge between users more eﬀectively than markets
can. Partly this is because many important innovations are simply orga-
nizational ones: many kinds of international technology transfer, even
in the twenty-ﬁrst century, take place not in the high-science contexts of
pharmaceuticals and aeronautics but in such diverse and comparatively
unglamorous ﬁelds as accounting and international hotel management.
Partly, though, it is because even technologies which are embodied in
physical things—machines or products—need some skill or know-how
to be used to their full eﬀect, or to be debugged and maintained, or to
be operated with a full awareness of their associated dangers (like the
side eﬀects of drug treatments). Many innovators have therefore real-
ized that an organization (a hospital or a ﬁrm, for instance) can deliver
the innovation in a more eﬀective and trustworthy fashion than through
any mere transfer of the physical object via a market transaction. And
what a market transaction cannot accomplish, mere theft will never be
able to achieve. So no innovator who can provide the organizational
support for her innovation need fear that theft will deprive her of all
rewards.
Far from making organizations redundant, the information revolution
of the late twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst centuries has made organiza-
tions more important than ever. As anyone who has ever found a million
responses to an internet search will realize, more information does not
imply more understanding. Increasingly, we need to know what infor-
mation to screen out in order to help us to understand our world. Homo
sapiens sapiens has come a long way from the caves of Blombos, Enka-
pune Ya Muto, and Chauvet. The colorful symbols illuminated by ﬁrelight
were like beacons in a night that was empty of human meaning (and that
prompted man, in his hunger for symbols, to people the forests and the
skies with gods). The contrast with the visual cacophony of symbols in
the modern urban environment could not be more striking. The psycho-
analyst and art critic Adrian Stokes even saw in the jagged sights and
sounds of the modern city a version of the disorder suﬀered by many
of the mentally ill.21 This is not an eccentric hypothesis: one inﬂuential

242 • Chapter 14
theory of the causes of schizophrenia, for example, suggests that suf-
ferers lack the ability to screen out irrelevant sensory information that
the rest of us unconsciously ignore, and for them the world is an unend-
ing howl.22 Modern man could easily suﬀer from a collectively generated
paranoid schizophrenia in the absence of guidance on how to evaluate
the results of each other’s endlessly restless creativity.23 To sort out the
emails oﬀering purported remedies for everything from poverty to sex-
ual impotence, or the torrent of solutions for the problems of the world
oﬀered by aspiring political leaders, or the bewildering variety of tech-
nical speciﬁcations for products and processes available from suppliers
across the world, all of us will continue to need the advice and good judg-
ment of people we can trust. Symbolic communication has not abolished
the problem of trust but has merely shifted it: from wanting to know
whether we can trust an individual to wanting to know whether we can
trust some collective source of information. As a result, the internet,
like the other manifestations of the information revolution, may radi-
cally change the nature of ﬁrms and other such organizations, but it will
never make them disappear.
There is a second way in which creativity has been historically pro-
tected without formal systems of intellectual property rights, and that
is through the support of political organizations of various kinds. The
historian David Landes has written, following earlier work by Eric Jones,
that one of the main reasons why the industrial revolution took place in
Europe before China (in spite of China’s awesome technological advances
during the Middle Ages and a period of impressive growth under the
Sung Dynasty over seven centuries before Europe’s industrialization)
was the continual competition for supremacy between Europe’s shifting
and decentralized political powers.24 This meant that innovators whose
ideas were insuﬃciently appreciated in one place might seek out the
support and protection of another (we saw above how this worked to
the beneﬁt of Protestant Geneva). In China an innovation that failed to
capture the favor of the emperor might not merely languish but even be
suppressed. Landes recounts how the magniﬁcent Chinese naval expe-
ditions of the early ﬁfteenth century, whose “ﬂotillas far surpassed in
grandeur the small Portuguese ﬂeets that came later,” were deliberately
halted by imperial decree: “By 1500, anyone who built a ship of more than
two masts was liable to the death penalty, and in 1525 coastal authori-
ties were enjoined to destroy all oceangoing ships and arrest their own-
ers. Finally, in 1551, it became a crime to go to sea on a multi-masted
ship, even for trade.”25 The Chinese emperor feared no one, certainly no

Knowledge and Symbolism • 243
foreigner. Europe’s potentates, in contrast, lived in a continual climate
of beneﬁcial and creative fear.
Political organizations have intervened in many ways in the workings
of modern societies, often to very good eﬀect. But just as with the mer-
chants about whom Adam Smith was so cynical, their motivations have
often been far less elevated than their rhetoric. Creativity has received
much support from emperors and princes throughout the ages, often in
the hope that it could be turned to aggressive as well as defensive ends.
We shall explore some of the consequences of this public support for
innovation in chapter 16. First, however, we shall look at one more of
the great unintended consequences of the division of labor in modern
society: the exclusion of the unfortunate.

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness
The Unemployed
I visited Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, for the ﬁrst time in 1995. The coun-
try was in a deep economic recession, so I was surprised to see evidence
of a great deal of construction activity. For several kilometers along the
road from the airport to the center of town, half-ﬁnished tower blocks
could be seen, clad in scaﬀolding and dominated by soaring cranes.
There were trucks, cement-mixers, piles of builders’ sand. After we had
driven for some minutes past this astonishing expanse of building site, I
was struck by an oddity, and asked my host, “Is today a public holiday?”
He shook his head. “I know what you’re thinking,” he said. “There’s no
one working there. There hasn’t been anyone for at least a couple of
years.” Suddenly this great panorama of buildings, vehicles, and equip-
ment, which had seemed to bear witness to a frenzy of activity, became
a bleak symbol of exactly the opposite—of so catastrophic a slump in
construction work that no one had bothered to remove those items of
equipment that could be salvaged. There was no point in salvaging them
if there was no work elsewhere for them to do.
In this scene the unemployed workers, in contrast to the unemployed
equipment, were invisible. They were probably at home, either ﬁred from
their jobs or on what is euphemistically termed “short-time working,”
which consoles them with the theoretical possibility of being recalled
in the unlikely event that demand picks up sometime soon. In mod-
ern Western societies, many of the casualties of economic recession,
like the casualties of poverty or illness, are similarly inconspicuous, but
this does not mean they are nonexistent, or few in number. Sometimes
they become visible in ways that can seem startling to those used to
the apparently orderly activity of busy people. The historian Piers Bren-
don has described what he calls “one of the most shocking instances
of state coercion in American history.” It took place during the Great

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 245
Depression, when in 1932 “20,000 unemployed Great War veterans con-
verged on Washington DC”:
Arriving in the capital from all over the country, their numbers swollen
by the attendant publicity … the veterans put up huts in open spaces or
squatted in empty buildings near the seat of government. Most camped
on the mosquito ridden Anacostia mud-ﬂats, nicknamed “Hard-Luck-
on-the-River” … They kept it as clean and sanitary as possible, digging
latrines … and even cultivating small gardens. Some brought their fam-
ilies. The men were digniﬁed and disciplined … [but nevertheless] frus-
tration led to confrontation.1
When veterans occupied several buildings near the Capitol that were due
for demolition, General Douglas MacArthur, the army chief of staﬀlater
to achieve fame and notoriety in the Paciﬁc and Korea, decided to “break
the back” of the demonstration. “So, late in the afternoon of 28 July,
four troops of cavalry, six whippet tanks and four companies of steel-
helmeted infantry with ﬁxed bayonets and machine guns advanced down
Pennsylvania Avenue … beating terriﬁed people with the ﬂats of their
sabers. … Scores of people were injured.” The buildings were emptied
and the shantytown was torched. The government defended the actions
of MacArthur although the latter had exceeded his orders, as he was later
to do more dramatically and dangerously during the Korean War. (He had
already provoked widespread derision when he claimed to the press that
the veterans were “animated by the essence of revolution.”) Though there
is evidence that many members of the administration, even Hoover him-
self, were genuinely disturbed by the massive numbers of unemployed in
depression America, the episode made clear that the unemployed were
expected by the authorities to remain inconspicuous. The more visible
they were, the greater the panic their presence induced. It was the sense
of breaking a prohibition that gave a hard political edge to the work of a
photographer like Walker Evans, who sought to make the victims of the
depression visible to the rest of America. In fact Evans came into con-
ﬂict with his employer the Farm Security Administration, whose photo-
graphic project was intended to show the possibility of a “better future”
for America’s rural poor, a possibility Evans’s bleak documentary realism
seemed to deny.2
The Great Depression popularized the notion that unemployment and
periodic economic collapse were particular characteristics of industrial
capitalism, the dark side of capitalism’s undoubted vigor and produc-
tivity in its sunnier spells. Coming so soon after the boom years of the

246 • Chapter 15
1920s, the depression also provoked the belief that capitalism was, of
all economic systems, the one most peculiarly prone to cycles of boom
and bust, with the good times buoyed up by nothing more solid than
optimism and the bad times locked in by collective gloom. Wall Street,
the center of the ﬁnancial markets, was nothing more than the casino in
which these paroxysms of optimism and pessimism were played out in
gambles made by ﬁnanciers with other people’s money and other peo-
ple’s lives.
Boom, Bust, and the Division of Labor
In fact, though boom and bust in the modern world are alarmingly depen-
dent on an evanescent state of conﬁdence, this is neither new nor pecu-
liar to modern industrial capitalism. It is deeply embedded in the division
of labor itself and is a danger in purely agricultural societies as well as
industrial ones. To see why, think of a simple society, without the use
of money, in which farmers face a choice between growing grain and
doing one of two other activities: baking bread or raising cattle for meat
and milk. Both of these activities have characteristics that make them
dependent on trust. In a society where the division of labor is well estab-
lished, some farmers will grow grain and exchange it with others who
bake bread or raise cattle, since there are advantages in specialization.
Not everyone wants to own or can eﬀectively operate a baking oven; not
everyone has the skills or the equipment appropriate to cattle farming.
We may suppose that both bakers and cattle farmers will need grain to
use in their own production, for feeding the ovens or the bovines, as well
as to eat while they are waiting for their own production to take place.
The diﬀerence between them is that cattle farmers need more grain, and
they need it for longer. Bakers can take grain and return it to the donor in
a day or so in the form of bread; cattle farmers take grain and return it in
the form of meat or milk many months later. This implies that while both
baking and cattle farming need trust, they need it to diﬀerent degrees.
For much of the time, we can imagine, the need for trust in this soci-
ety is fairly latent. Bakers give bread directly in return for grain; cat-
tle farmers oﬀer meat and milk directly for the grain they need—each
one acquires the inputs necessary for future production by oﬀering the
output of production in the past. For established citizens, there is no
problem; it’s a straight swap. Young bakers and cattle farmers starting
up in business, on the other hand, have to persuade grain growers to
lend them grain until they have produced enough bread, milk, or meat

to repay the loan. Becoming a cattle farmer needs more trustworthiness
than becoming a baker, but normally speaking there should be a ready
supply of young recruits to both activities.
Now imagine a crisis of trust in this simple society. Perhaps the word
goes round that the harvest may fail, grain may become scarce, and the
bakers and livestock farmers will no longer repay the grain they owe, pre-
ferring to hoard it instead. Or perhaps echoes of a distant ethnic conﬂict
make arable farmers (from tribe A) suddenly doubtful about the trust-
worthiness of bakers (from tribe B) and openly hostile to cattle farmers
(from tribe C). In this new atmosphere of suspicion, arable farmers may
no longer be willing to lend their grain to either bakers or cattle farmers.
If the crisis is comparatively mild, it may be bakers who suﬀer worst,
since cattle farmers can live for some time oﬀtheir own stocks of meat
and milk, while the bakers have only a few days’ stock to live on. In a
more severe crisis, the cattle farmers may suﬀer more, since their cattle
will die or be taken from them by force, to repay the past loans of grain
on which they have defaulted purely because no one would lend them
any grain for the future. The bakers will have no grain either, but they
will have fewer debts hanging over them and may be able to pick them-
selves up more easily if the crisis passes. Both bakers and cattle farmers
may think wistfully how much easier everything would have been if they
had only stuck to growing grain (siren voices may even call for a return
to permanent self-suﬃciency in the future). Eventually, the scarcity of
bread, meat, and milk will make some more adventurous spirits think
about setting up as bakers or cattle farmers again, and some adventur-
ous fellow citizens willing to lend them grain in order to get going. But
there will have been a cycle of boom and bust driven by nothing more
than the waxing and waning of trust. And not a factory or a stock market
in sight.
This parable naturally simpliﬁes many of the processes at work in
modern industrial societies. We are supposing that cattle farmers may
become bankrupt and unemployed because other people stop trust-
ing cattle farmers. In modern societies, though, it is just as likely that
machine operators will become unemployed because other people stop
trusting ﬁnance directors. Or a crisis of conﬁdence in the housing market
may lead to a fall in house prices, which means that banks will earn less
on mortgage loans and thus have less capital to lend to businesses. So
a ﬁrm making shirts can go bankrupt purely because some people have
changed their minds about the reliability of houses as investments for
the future. Because of the multiplicity of trust relations in the modern

248 • Chapter 15
world, the failure of some particular trust relation can hurt individuals
who were never part of that trust relation in the ﬁrst place. In spite of
its simpliﬁcation, though, what the parable shows very clearly is that
losses of conﬁdence are a risk that is inherent in any society dependent
on the division of labor, whenever that division of labor requires (as it
almost always does) that some individuals depend on the trust of others
in order to be able to specialize. And the more elaborate the division of
labor the greater the possibilities for the web of trust that sustains it to
unravel.
Sometimes trust is too easily gained, and charlatans abuse it. Would-
be cattle ranchers may ﬁnd it easy to borrow enormous quantities of
grain on the strength of a swagger and a Stetson. Or shares in dot.com
start-ups may trade for vast prices without any proﬁts in prospect (the
strength of the share price is an indicator of the ease with which the
ﬁrm’s owners are borrowing money). Sometimes, on the other hand, trust
is too hard to acquire, and honest, competent people cannot make a
living or may even lose the living they had previously been making. In
the early twenty-ﬁrst century, as in the 1930s, we may think that stock
markets are primarily to blame, since in the late 1990s and the ﬁrst
years of the new millennium, as in the late 1920s, stock markets inﬂated
the boom in a way that postponed and magniﬁed the subsequent bust.
Stock markets increase the dangers, by their very eﬃciency at bring-
ing together borrowers and lenders, entrepreneurs and investors, people
with ideas and families with savings. No way has yet been devised, nor
will any ever be, to give us more opportunities to invest for our future
without giving us more chances to be cheated through others’ exploit-
ing our overwhelming desire to become rich. But as this parable should
teach us, stock market booms and crashes are just one particular mod-
ern manifestation of trust cycles, and trust cycles, as we saw in chapter 8,
are a problem that has much older roots.
The 1930s, with their terrible economic conditions and the terrible
political events to which they gave rise popularized the idea that mod-
ern industrial capitalism was peculiarly unstable. The experience of the
Great Depression also popularized the idea that the job of modern gov-
ernments was to step in to control this instability. This is an attractive
and reasonable idea, but also a dangerous one. Modern industrial cap-
italism is indeed unstable, though not uniquely so in our history and
not for historically unprecedented reasons. Markets are indeed full of
charming optimists (not to mention downright charlatans) seeking to
capitalize on our trust, but so are governments and political parties.

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 249
Our political opinions are no less dependent on word-of-mouth commu-
nication and no less vulnerable to herding behavior than our investment
opinions—sometimes more so, since we are less often required to back
our opinions with our own money. Experts too are vulnerable, as we saw
in chapter 8: while it’s true that normally shrewd investors can become
strangely gullible under the inﬂuence of market enthusiasm, so can nor-
mally shrewd regulators. After all, it was the famously cautious Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the United States Federal Reserve Board and
the most powerful economic oﬃcial in the world, who in 1996 warned
about the “irrational exuberance” of stock markets and within a year,
having overlooked his own warning, was suggesting that the extraordi-
nary levels of share prices were warranted by a radical change in the
nature of the American economy—rather as the economist Irving Fisher
had crowed in 1929 that “stock prices have reached what looks like a
permanently high plateau.” The moral, therefore, is that the division of
economic labor certainly leaves us open to cycles of boom and bust. But
so does the division of labor between citizens, the politicians they elect,
and the regulators whom those politicians appoint. Only if we are alive
to the way in which trust is taken and given in the various arenas that
make up modern society will we be able to use the institutions in which
trust remains healthy to cure the deﬁciency of the institutions in which
trust has decayed.
In a year when the world economy is functioning comparatively well
(as it was before the ﬁnancial crisis broke in 2007), there are perhaps 30
million people in the industrialized countries alone who are registered as
unemployed—roughly equal to the populations of Canada or Morocco. In
a bad year, there may be over twice that number, and if they all stood in a
single line for their dole payments, the line might stretch from New York
to Las Vegas or from London to Moscow. In fact, they are dispersed and
comparatively inconspicuous. Many of them—and proportionately more
in the bad years—are like the bakers and cattle farmers in our parable.
They are people whose role in the division of labor was established on the
basis of a trust that has now evaporated, and who will now have to pick
themselves up and start again, perhaps in the same role once the blizzard
has passed, perhaps in a new one. In the meantime, though, the stresses
upon them are severe, since unemployment means the loss not just of
income but also of self-conﬁdence and the sense of belonging. Some of
the unemployed, less disturbingly, are between jobs. (In just the same
way, some of the passengers on a railway will be waiting at the station,
between trains.) Some, however, are unemployed for a diﬀerent reason:

250 • Chapter 15
the only work they can do is so unproductive and so exhausting that it
is better to opt out altogether. This last kind of unemployment certainly
occurs in the industrialized world and can be unintentionally provoked
by tax-and-beneﬁt systems that penalize people by withdrawing beneﬁts
as soon as they begin to earn even a small wage. But it is in the developing
world, and especially in its rural areas, that this kind of unemployment
is chronic, desperate—and visible everywhere.
Poverty and Information Islands
Kovilur is a small hamlet in the arid plain at the center of the state of
Tamil Nadu in south India. After the rains, the inhabitants plant ﬁelds
of sorghum and millet in the newly softened earth, but in the dry season
the ground is a dusty brick-red. The village is made up of around thirty
houses, some of mud, some of concrete, grouped in straggling fashion
around a temple whose high, trapezoid tower, decorated with statues
of Hindu gods, stands in magniﬁcent silhouette against the evening sky.
The temple, though run-down and rarely visited, is unusually ﬁne even by
the standards of southern India, but in many other respects this village
and its neighboring hamlets are little diﬀerent from millions of others
across the developing world. There is signiﬁcant malnutrition among
their inhabitants; preventable illnesses like polio still claim victims; few
children go to school. And many people spend long hours motionless,
inactive, in whatever shade they can ﬁnd. They are unemployed.
That’s not to say they have nothing to do. Most women still rise at
4 a.m., to sweep the house and prepare breakfast for their men and
proﬁt from the cool hours around dawn to fetch water and ﬁrewood,
often walking several kilometers with a cluster of branches on their head
or a swaying pot on their hip. They may not get to sleep before 11 p.m. or
midnight, and most complain that exhaustion is the permanent color of
their lives. The younger and ﬁtter men rise at six and leave their village
by seven in quest of work. Those who have bicycles are lucky. Those
who don’t, like the women whom social regulation prevents from riding
alone, are conﬁned to searching for work within walking distance.
Such work exists. The village of Manipuram, some twelve kilometers
away, is a crowded, bustling place in the green zone irrigated by the
waters of the great river Cauvery.3 Fields of rice paddy, banana, and
sugarcane crowd the available space, and in the waterlogged areas, reeds
are harvested, to be woven into mats. Preparing and drying the reeds pro-
vides work for many, especially for women and children, though men

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 251
will work at this too during lean times. The merchants who manage the
preparations, delivering bundles of harvested reeds to the workers and
collecting the dried results, complain that it is hard to get as many work-
ers as they would like. So why are the workers only twelve kilometers
away still unemployed?
It makes no sense for the merchants to take the reeds to the work-
ers. Newly harvested reeds are heavy, full of moisture, and expensive
to transport. Processed reeds are dry and light, so it makes sense for
the processing to happen near to where the reeds are grown and for the
transport to happen afterward. So why don’t the workers come to the
reeds? Twelve kilometers may seem like nothing to a visiting foreigner
with a car, but it is a whole pilgrimage to an undernourished worker
who must walk in the hot sun with no assurance of being able to ﬁnd
work at the end (those who do make the journey ﬁnd work only three-
quarters of the time, and they are the optimistic, well-connected ones).
When you have little enough to eat in the ﬁrst place, you must conserve
your limited energy rather than gamble it on speculative ventures.
To put it another way, a hungry man can be a formidable competitor,
but a hungry man who has to walk a long way ﬁrst is no competitor at all.
The result is that the comparatively ﬂourishing job market in Manipuram
has little impact on the lives of those who live in Kovilur. These two
villages may be no more than a few kilometers apart, but economically
they are in diﬀerent worlds.
How can we understand why the world excludes some of its potentially
productive citizens in this way? The answer lies in the kinds of connec-
tion that individual citizens have with others in their society. Much of
the history of the last ten thousand years, as we have seen in earlier
chapters, has been about individuals being brought closer to strangers—
either physically closer, as the barriers to movement have fallen, or closer
in the space of knowledge (two people on opposite sides of the world can
know enough about each other to engage in multimillion dollar transac-
tions with as much conﬁdence as they have in crossing the street). Yet
the more sophisticated the modern division of labor becomes, the more
we risk being brought up sharply against its limits. Someone may feel
comfortable lending money to a foreign banker she has never met, but
hesitant to lend money to the man in the next-door apartment. Who is
he, and what is his track record with other people’s money? The man
next door is not physically remote from her, but as far as her ability to
trust him is concerned, he is living on an information island.

252 • Chapter 15
Every village in a poor country is an information island. This does
much to explain why decades of foreign aid, not to mention large ﬂows
of private capital from rich to poor countries, have made so much less
impact on poverty in the developing world than optimists about global
integration have hoped. Investors remain reluctant to invest in societies
about which they know very little, and for good reason, since when
they do invest, they often make foolish choices. And the ignorance of
investors may begin as close as the end of the street. So villagers in
Kovilur cannot raise funds for businesses or schools—some cannot even
raise money to buy bicycles. They remain conﬁned to farm labor which
leaves them hungry and weak. Their hunger and weakness leave them
less able to impress outsiders with their potential for making good use
of investment resources, or even with their reliability for a simple but
demanding task like working the land.
Even in rich countries, individual neighborhoods can be information
islands. In Chicago’s South Side, as sociologist Sudhir Alladi Venkatesh
recounts, unemployment, poverty, and crime persist when prosperity
and dynamism are just a few blocks away.4 But that doesn’t mean that
all a person has to do is move. Dysfunctional though your neighborhood
may seem, if you move away you lose the few ties that protect you from
the worst; you no longer have others to vouch for you, you become an
anonymous drifter in a world where identity is everything.
Not only does modern society often fail to build bridges to those on
information islands; it can even, in subtle but sometimes devastating
ways, weaken those bridges that already exist. The way it does so is
through a process known as “assortative matching,” whose importance
in explaining the persistence of poverty and exclusion is only gradu-
ally coming to be given proper recognition.5 We saw in chapter 14 that
some of society’s most important institutions, such as ﬁrms, are those
that channel information more eﬀectively among their members than is
possible through the comparatively anonymous institutions of the mar-
ket. Something similar is true of villages in the developing world; their
inhabitants, rich and poor, have far fewer secrets from each other than is
possible in cities or in the dormitory villages common in parts of the rich
world. Certainly, information ﬂows far more freely within villages than
between them. A bank oﬃcial might know exactly who could be trusted
to repay a loan among the inhabitants of his own village but might be
completely baﬄed when required to make the same judgment in a vil-
lage a few kilometers away, and might not even know whom he could
reliably ask for advice.

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 253
If institutions such as ﬁrms and villages are eﬀective information chan-
nels, it matters who belongs to the same institutions as you do. People
who can make eﬀective use of the information they have are also peo-
ple who can transmit such information eﬀectively to their fellow mem-
bers. This is a simple point but one with profound consequences. For
as modern society has improved the ease with which people can travel,
search for jobs, choose where to live, or ﬁnd suitable marriage part-
ners or business associates, the membership of society’s most impor-
tant institutions has begun to sort itself into a hierarchy of skill that
increasingly replaces the old hierarchy of birth. Talented individuals
move out of their villages to mingle with other talented individuals in
the towns. High earners marry other high earners. Gifted workers frus-
trated by the constraints of a large organization leave to form start-ups
with similarly gifted colleagues. Parents dissatisﬁed with the education
their children are receiving sell their house to move to a better-funded
(because more prosperous) school district. This restless ambition of the
talented is often the source of much creativity, but it has consequences
for those they leave behind. In recent years, for instance, it has been cited
as the source of important changes in the structure of businesses in rich
countries. Whereas (to caricature the facts a little) the typical Ameri-
can ﬁrm of the 1950s might have been General Motors, a ﬁrm employing
both high-skilled and low-skilled individuals, the typical ﬁrms of the late
twentieth century were Microsoft (employing mainly high-skilled people)
and McDonald’s (employing mainly low-skilled people). The fact that the
high-skilled and the low-skilled are now less likely even to work in the
same ﬁrms matters, precisely because of the way that information ﬂows
more eﬀectively within ﬁrms than between them.
Assortative Matching
How is this happening? Recent theories of assortative matching have
been casting important light on the process, in contexts as diverse as
labor markets, education, sexual behavior, and ﬁnancial markets. A fun-
damental insight of such theories is that each person’s productivity—the
value to herself or to others of what she produces—depends not just
on her own talent and eﬀort but on the talent and eﬀort of those she
works with. This is an insight with which most people who work in large
organizations and dream of how productive they might be if they were
not held back by their mediocre colleagues would wholeheartedly agree
(their colleagues probably feel the same way about them). It implies that

254 • Chapter 15
individuals impose externalities on each other in ﬁrms, just as they do
in cities, as we saw in chapter 10 (cities, after all, are information chan-
nels, just as ﬁrms are). The presence of such externalities alerts us to the
possibility of some pathological eﬀects at the level of society as a whole.
A powerful implication of such theories is that if individuals can
choose their working colleagues, the result is likely to be much more
damaging to those with low ability than it would be if individuals were
obliged to work with those whom chance (or birth, tradition, or family
history) had happened to give them as neighbors. In eﬀect, free choice
leads to sorting, in which the talented pair oﬀwith the talented and the
rest with the rest. As a result, people of low ability are twice cursed: ﬁrst
by their own low ability and then again by the low ability of those with
whom they are obliged to work.6 Another consequence is that people
of high ability have a greater incentive to invest in making themselves
even more productive, because the value of that investment will not be
diminished by the low productivity of the people they have to work with.
It’s worth looking a little more carefully at how this happens. Con-
sider an extreme version of the theory that says a person’s productiv-
ity depends on her colleagues. Call it the “weakest-link” theory of pro-
duction: the productivity of a whole team depends on the talent and
eﬀort of the weakest member of the team. (The economist Michael Kre-
mer has dubbed this the “O-ring” theory of production, after the ring of
rubber sealant whose failure caused the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger on takeoﬀin 1986, thereby illustrating the dependence of a
vast and expensive piece of equipment on the functioning of one simple
component.7) Suppose teams are initially made up of random mixes of
talented and untalented people, and that with a bit of investment any
person’s talents can be improved by the appropriate training. In each
team it makes sense to concentrate the investment on the least talented
person, because that person is the weakest link whose lack of talent
weakens the whole team. So, through society as a whole, looking after
the disadvantaged turns out to be a good bet for the others.
Now suppose people can choose their colleagues. Everyone would like
to have talented colleagues, of course, so somehow there has to be a
mechanism for rationing such people out. Suppose the mechanism is like
an auction. It doesn’t have to be a literal auction: it could work through
the job market or the housing market, in which people (or the ﬁrms
they represent) pay for the privilege of having talented colleagues or
successful neighbors. It’s easy to see that those who are talented and
successful themselves will be willing to bid more in this auction, because

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 255
those whom they recruit will be more productive than if they worked
with less talented bidders. Consequently, the talented will match with
the talented.
Let’s now consider the eﬀect of this on incentives to invest in mak-
ing people more productive, through education or on-the-job training. It
will still be true that, within any one working group, it makes sense to
concentrate investment on the least talented (because of the “weakest-
link” eﬀect). But more talented groups will face a higher return on their
investment than less talented groups, because each newly educated per-
son will be working with more talented colleagues. The result is likely to
be ghettoes of low talent, with low rates of investment and growth, and
neighborhoods of high talent with high rates of investment and growth.
A useful analogy is with investment in the bandwidth of internet con-
nections. Many people who have installed broadband connections adver-
tising download speeds of many megabytes per second have been disap-
pointed to discover that their actual download speeds are a tiny fraction
of this rate. The speed of anyone’s download is determined by the slow-
est connection in the link between the source and destination computers.
Consequently, in any one network it makes sense to concentrate invest-
ment on the slowest connection. But a network with faster connections
on average will still see a bigger improvement in download times for
any given investment. This accounts for the snowball eﬀect of broad-
band connections: when nobody else has them, they are not worth the
expense, but the more other people own them the more valuable they
become. Such eﬀects—sometimes called “network externalities”—arise
whenever technologies connect people, whether by broadband, by tele-
phone, or even by horse and cart along a dirt track. Put simply, it takes
two to connect, and it’s not worth connecting if there’s no one to connect
to. The loneliness of the underconnected global citizen accounts, in one
way or another, for much of the economic stagnation that persists in the
midst of global plenty, blighting the lives of billions of people across the
world.
This is not to say that technology alone is the answer to the problems
of the isolated poor like the villagers of Kovilur. Kovilur is not cut oﬀ
physically from the world. Its inhabitants make the journey out; develop-
ment workers, government oﬃcials, traveling merchants (balancing pots
and pans precariously in beehive formation on the backs of their bicy-
cles) all make the journey in. Travelers with a religious mission occasion-
ally arrive to do puja at the temple, which was a famous pilgrimage desti-
nation in former years. Bankers visit to make loans to those farmers who

256 • Chapter 15
can credibly promise to repay. But in spite of these contacts, the village
moneylenders still do regular business at interest rates far above those
charged by banks in the towns. Too many children leave school after a
year or two of fruitless study, barely able to sign their names. Those who
do continue their studies, in a school whose single teacher often does
not show up for class, may be unable afterward to ﬁnd any work more
rewarding than hard labor in the ﬁelds. Toddlers can be seen sitting in
front of their huts with the sticky look of the malnourished; polio victims
move around angularly on skeletal legs. The village has much potential,
but it is not developed. Those who might help it to develop cannot trust
its inhabitants enough to make the eﬀort seem worthwhile, and its inhab-
itants lack the experience and self-conﬁdence to project themselves as
credible participants in the demanding rituals of the outside world. In
the center of a world that is interconnected as never before in history,
Kovilur, like hundreds of thousands of villages across India and millions
across the world, remains an information island.
Illness and Exclusion
Some prosperous citizens of rich countries can also feel like islands in
an uncomprehending sea, cut oﬀfrom the compact of trust that sus-
tains the majority of their fellow citizens. In any year it is estimated
that some 15 million Americans suﬀer from clinical depression, though
fewer than half of these receive treatment. In 2006 just over 33,000
Americans committed suicide (according to oﬃcial ﬁgures), making it
the third most common cause of death among young people, only a lit-
tle less common than homicide; it’s likely that quite a number of deaths
classiﬁed as accidents (especially car accidents) were suicide as well. In
the world as a whole, around a million people a year commit suicide,
and the rate has been climbing steadily in the half century that inter-
nationally comparable records have been kept.8 The cause of suicide is
mysterious. At an individual level, it’s often linked to economic distress:
suicide rates typically go up in recessions and down in booms (the rates
in America declined every year from 1994 to 1999, for instance, though
they showed no clear pattern from 2000 onwards). Yet poor countries
are not necessarily more vulnerable than rich ones. Countries in Latin
America have much lower rates than the United States or Canada, and
the Latin countries in southern Europe (Italy, Spain, and Portugal) have
much lower rates than Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. There are
some other startling discrepancies in the incidence of suicide. Men kill

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 257
themselves four times as often as women, though women make more
suicide attempts. The Netherlands has a male suicide rate only 40 per
cent that of neighboring Belgium. Norway, Sweden, and Denmark have
only middling rates by world standards (contrary to folk wisdom and the
impression cultivated assiduously by Ibsen, Strindberg, and Bergman),
but Finland has a male suicide rate nearly twice as high as theirs. Con-
trary to folk wisdom too, the suicide rate among Native Americans in the
United States is slightly lower than it is among whites, while for blacks it
is less than half the rate for whites. It is in Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union that suicide has reached epidemic proportions, with more
than one in two thousand Russian, Belorussian, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Lat-
vian, Hungarian, and Lithuanian men killing themselves every year.
No economic theory is ever likely to explain convincingly why one per-
son rather than another succumbs to depression or suicide: depression
is an illness, with organic as well as cognitive causes. But the treatment
of depression is an economic phenomenon, consuming enormous eco-
nomic resources. Both the reported incidence and the nature of depres-
sion, like that of other mental and nonmental illnesses, respond to eco-
nomic incentives and are shaped by economic constraints. Most of the
diﬃcult choices in medicine, involving how much to spend on a person’s
treatment and what exactly to spend it on, are made by healthy people on
behalf of people who are sick. That means they respond to the healthy
person’s sense of priorities. This, though it sounds alarming, is both
inevitable and, on balance, desirable. But the result is to increase the
isolation felt by the sick themselves.
The healthy decide on behalf of the sick in two main ways. First,
healthy people decide how much to spend on care of the sick, instead of
on other things. Often those decisions are made by the patients them-
selves, before they become sick. I may choose between diﬀerent levels
of health insurance, some of which cost more today but give me more
generous beneﬁts if I fall ill. When illness strikes, I may regret that I was
not more generous in my choice of insurance program, but that doesn’t
imply that my choice was foolish. We should all make provision for a
rainy day, but we should also live while the sun shines without expect-
ing to know just when or how often rain will fall. Our choices of health
insurance will depend on how great we think the risks are, as well as
how much we need to put aside to pay for them. Yet however wisely we
make these choices, when we fall ill we come to know something we did
not know before, something which estranges us a little from the healthy
person we were then.

258 • Chapter 15
Often, though, decisions are made by some healthy members of society
about the resources to be devoted to other people who are sick. This may
be because there is a national health service in the country concerned, as
there is in the United Kingdom; we can think of this as a choice to have
collective health insurance, with premiums paid compulsorily through
the tax system. Or it may be because some individuals have not insured
themselves (whether through ignorance, poverty, or deliberate choice)
and lack the resources to fund their own treatment. Most modern soci-
eties are unwilling to live with the consequences of letting uninsured
people fend entirely for themselves. There exist public hospitals, albeit
crowded and underfunded ones, in many countries that have no national
health service as such. Alternatively, healthy people may direct resources
to the sick because they have a direct individual interest in their fate.
Particularly through infectious disease, the sick create important exter-
nalities for others that, as we saw in chapter 10, no modern society can
aﬀord to ignore.
The second way the healthy decide on behalf of the sick is by advising
how given health budgets should be spent. This can be a matter of advis-
ing a sick person how to make choices among the various treatments
available, given the resources she has. Or it can be a matter of advis-
ing a funder—an insurance company, a hospital, a public authority—as
to who is sick and how sick they are. Usually, in fact, it is both at the
same time. In either case, the decision must be made not just by some-
one who is well but by someone with the appropriate medical skills. The
patient herself may need advice not just because she is inexpert but also
because her illness interferes with her judgment. But even a patient with
unimpaired judgment will need the advice of someone with experience
and scientiﬁc knowledge. And in the face of serious illness, in which a
patient is brought into the anteroom of her own mortality, she needs to
feel she can trust the humanity and not just the expertise of her medical
advisers.
So the patient has someone making decisions on her behalf, decisions
that have important consequences for her state of health but also for
the resources available to treat others (every time a doctor recommends
a patient for urgent surgery, other patients on the surgeon’s list have to
wait a little longer). The patient trusts the doctor to act on her behalf,
and the doctor’s Hippocratic oath is a solemn commitment to do just
that. And yet (though the Hippocratic oath does not state this explic-
itly, and many doctors feel acutely uncomfortable even discussing this
awkward fact about their professional orientation) almost all medical

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 259
consultations are conducted on behalf of some funder, some economic
institution, as well as on behalf of the patient herself. The doctor must
not exaggerate the patient’s condition purely in order to win her more
rapid treatment, although common sense and simple humanity often
lead doctors to give the patient the beneﬁt of the doubt. Doctors may
prescribe a drug or an operation but they do so knowing the rules of the
institution they represent, rules that determine priorities for allocating
resources. When is an operation to remove secondary tumors a waste of
resources that could save a patient whose cancer is less far advanced?
When is cosmetic surgery a vital aid for recovery after a disﬁguring acci-
dent rather than just a way of pretending to avoid the aging process?
When is Viagra appropriate? Medical decisions are not simply diagnos-
tic; they are economic through and through.
The Inevitable Distortions of Delegated Decision Making
The economic consequences of having someone else make decisions
on your behalf have been studied in a vast array of contexts in recent
years, from the relations between bosses and workers to those between
politicians and the electorate, from the way farmers made decisions to
the way governments allocate foreign aid. What has come to be known
as the “principal–agent problem” describes the many ways in which a
person who needs something done (known as the principal) can moti-
vate her agent (her doctor, say) to act as closely in accordance with her
interests as possible.9 The motivations that matter most in medicine are
rarely simply ﬁnancial; doctors may care about money, but they rarely
care just about money. They also care about their patients, about their
role as objective scientists, and about the esteem of their professional
colleagues—being struck oﬀfor medical negligence is a blow that costs a
doctor far more than loss of earnings. But economic incentives can work
through manipulating esteem as well. A system in which doctors can be
sued for failing to operate but cannot be sued for performing an opera-
tion that was unnecessary will ineluctably lead to an increase in unnec-
essary operations. And fear of being held responsible can work through
even more indirect channels. As one medical case study puts it, “one rea-
son doctors put patients in the hospital is simply to have them rest and
be taken care of … [but] in the hospital it is easy for physicians (unless
they stop and think about it) to perform unnecessary procedures simply
because the means for doing so are readily available.”10 Sometimes the
pressure is in the other direction: it can be diﬃcult to get admission to

260 • Chapter 15
the hospital at all for some conditions, particularly where diagnosis is as
diﬃcult as it is in mental health. The outcome is paradoxical: too much
treatment for some conditions, too little for others, and inadequate time
in the hospital combined with too much high-technology intervention
while there.
Many case studies of medical practice have emphasized how economic
pressures shape the way doctors think about their patients, and how
these pressures can aﬀect trust. Two features of medicine make this
tension particularly acute. One is that doctors are forced to be servants
of two masters: their patients and those who are paying their patients’
bills. In many industrialized countries the costs of health care have been
rising dramatically, as technology has advanced, as expectations have
risen, and as the comparatively cheap diseases of poverty have given way
to the expensive, chronic diseases of aﬄuence. The response, both by
public authorities and by private insurers, has been to squeeze budgets,
demand more explicit justiﬁcation for each intervention, and demand
that doctors play the role of resource managers in much more explicit
ways than they have been used to. In the United States this has come
about largely through what is known as “managed care,” in which insur-
ance companies, instead of simply reimbursing medical expenses after
treatment, require hospitals to negotiate explicit treatment regimes with
them even before such treatment takes place. Though such pressures
are in some respects inevitable, many doctors ﬁnd them not only diﬃ-
cult but counterproductive. They can undermine the very relationship of
trust that is central to the therapeutic relationship between doctor and
patient in the ﬁrst place.
The second feature of medicine that adds to the tension is that only
some treatments for illness have an immediate, veriﬁable impact. Those
that don’t may be no less important, but their appropriateness for the
particular case is much harder to demonstrate to the satisfaction of an
insurer or a hospital manager. The economists Bengt Holmström and
Paul Milgrom have shown that when agents working for a principal are
forced to choose between tasks whose results are easy to verify and
tasks that are important but hard to verify, they not only cut back on
the tasks that are hard to verify but may even put too much eﬀort into
the easy ones!11 In medical terms that means too many drugs, too little of
almost everything else. Anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann has described
this process at work in American psychiatry. It’s harder to do research
on the eﬀectiveness of psychotherapy than on the eﬀectiveness of drug
treatments. And it’s harder to do research on the long-term impact of

Exclusion: Unemployment, Poverty, and Illness • 261
drug treatments than on their ability to provide immediate symptomatic
relief. It’s harder to show the value of in-patient treatment beyond its
eﬀect on stabilizing the condition of individuals in crisis. So the bud-
getary pressures on American medical care have had a more dramatic
impact on psychiatry than on other branches of medicine, and within
psychiatry there has been a sharp move away from therapy-based “talk-
ing cures” toward purely drug-based interventions.12
Undeniably, some kinds of talking cure are ineﬀective, and others may
go on for longer than their therapeutic eﬀectiveness warrants. Never-
theless, there is growing evidence that drug-based treatments are more
eﬀective when combined with psychotherapy than they are on their
own. Even in the narrow terms of reducing the length of hospital stays,
the pressures of managed care have often been counterproductive, by
encouraging hospitals to oﬄoad their problem cases onto each other
in a way that is collectively self-defeating for everyone. Psychotic or
depressed patients discharged too quickly from one hospital may stop
taking their medication and quickly ﬁnd themselves in the emergency
admissions room of another hospital in the same city; they bounce from
one institution to another, often being treated by doctors unfamiliar with
their case, and in the end require much more extensive hospitalization
than they would have if they had simply stayed longer in the original
facility. Worse, as Luhrmann describes the situation, whole states and
regions compete to play pass-the-parcel:
One of the startling consequences of psychiatric illness is the way state
administrators sometimes oﬄoad patients onto other states. In south-
ern California, patients would show up in the psychiatric emergency
room and explain that they had been in Minnesota or Illinois and had
gone to the bus station and a nice man from the county mental health
had bought them a bus ticket to San Diego, which they thought they’d
like to visit.13
Economic pressures can even aﬀect the very character of illness itself.
In Luhrmann’s words:
Our psychiatric professionals, as well as the rest of us, have expecta-
tions of the psychiatrically ill, and we institutionalize those expecta-
tions in subtle and unsubtle ways that can lead people to mimic the
symptoms we think they should have. If a homeless veteran wants a
warm bed for the night, he can learn what words and gestures will per-
suade the psychiatrist on call to admit him to the hospital. If a woman
receives a disability check each month for her psychiatric diagnosis,
she will learn how to avoid having the support curtailed. … the psychi-
atrically ill learn to play roles our society has designed for them.14

262 • Chapter 15
As the rest of Luhrmann’s study makes distressingly plain, the fact that
some of the mentally ill learn to play the roles we assign them does not
make them any less ill.
Exclusion and Collective Action
The unemployed, the poor, the seriously ill, all in their diﬀerent ways
can ﬁnd themselves excluded from the compact of trust that, by and
large, succeeds in sustaining the baroque ediﬁce that is modern human
society. No one planned it that way, but that’s no less reason to ﬁnd the
result unacceptable. True, the process should not be caricatured: in most
cases it’s less awful to be unemployed, poor, or sick today than it was two
hundred or two thousand or twenty thousand years ago.15 Romanticized
accounts of bucolic poverty in the Middle Ages, or claims that the men-
tally ill are creative souls who would have been revered as saints in the
days before psychiatric drugs and hospitalization, are mostly fantasies
that gloss over the sheer grim misery of most poverty and mental illness,
not to mention the cruelty with which earlier ages often treated their own
unfortunates (burning mentally ill women as witches, for example).16
Accounts of the relaxed and playful life of hunter-gatherers are simi-
larly misleading: aside from the evidence of violence discussed in chap-
ter 3, the skeletons of hunter-gatherers from North and South America
reveal that more than half of them suﬀered from abscesses that must
have been excruciatingly painful in those days long before the inven-
tion of aspirin.17 Nevertheless, the fact remains that while for many cit-
izens of modern society the compact of trust works, if not perfectly, far
better than our ancestors could ever have imagined, for the excluded
it works haphazardly, if at all. And to the extent that the condition of
the excluded has improved in comparison with previous ages, that is
largely due to a conscious eﬀort of collective action. Modern societies
have sought, through coercion or persuasion, to act in groups so as to
modify the results of the uncoordinated division of labor—and fortu-
nately, that division of labor has, by increasing overall prosperity, made
it easier to aﬀord the costs of doing so. This collective action is what we
can call politics, in a very broad sense of the term.
If a society with no one in charge, characterized by tunnel vision and
dependent on a fragile web of trust, cannot protect its environment or
look after its excluded, what can be expected from collective action? How
well can collective action make up for the deﬁciencies of the division of
labor? This will be the subject of part IV.

Epilogue to Part III
The theme of part III has been the way in which the character of human
societies in the mass is shaped by the pervasive presence of externali-
ties. This character may be attractive or repellent, but it has been end-
lessly fascinating to economists.1 Entire branches of economics have
sprung up to deal with various themes that have been touched on in
these chapters: the geography of cities and of economic development
more generally,2 the way in which environmental resources are depleted
in the absence of incentives to take care of them,3 the way in which dif-
ferent types of markets allocate resources and summarize the informa-
tion that traders unwittingly reveal about their motivations and beliefs.4
This last example shows that some of the most subtle but important
externalities are those created by information: what one person does
can reveal to others, often for free, information the person herself may
have had to spend a lot of time, money, or eﬀort to acquire. Jealous of
these revelations, people can be driven to hoard information, often with
only partial success. Whether successful or not, their eﬀorts to hoard
information shape the institutions of which human society is made up.5
Firms, for example, can channel some kinds of information more eﬀec-
tively than markets can, and this advantage gives ﬁrms an edge over
markets in coordinating some kinds of activity. When this advantage is
strong, ﬁrms can even become quite large, standing out as great islands
of hierarchy and planning in a sea of decentralized market activity.
Just as ﬁshermen deplete the stock of cod left in the open sea without
wishing to do so, subject only to the iron law that today’s catch leaves
fewer ﬁsh for the trawlermen of tomorrow, so human beings in their
manipulation of symbols are shaping the stock of knowledge available
for the knowledge users of tomorrow. The use of knowledge, though,
adds to the stock rather than depleting it, so the eﬀorts of today’s
researchers mean that, whether they intend this or not, our descendants
will know many things that we did not know today. As we shall see, this
is not always a good thing.

264 • Epilogue to Part III
Part IV explores one of the most deadly externalities of all: the way
that cooperation within a group (often motivated by a wish to overcome
some of the failings of uncoordinated individual action) can make the
group more lethally aggressive in its dealings with outsiders. Of all the
legacies of our hunter-gatherer past, this poses by far the most troubling
threat to the great experiment launched by humanity ten thousand years
ago.

Prologue to Part IV
One of the great puzzles of prehistory is why agriculture caught on
so fast. You might think that, once the idea appeared and the climate
made it possible, the answer was obvious: why go out to hunt and gather
when you can sit home and watch the grass grow? The reality, though,
is more complex. Sitting and watching the grass grow is not the idyll
it seems, for those who are sedentary are also vulnerable. When ene-
mies attack, hunter-gatherers can simply melt into the forest, but farm-
ers have much more to lose: houses, chattels, stores of food. So farm-
ers not only face high risks but also need to spend time, energy, and
resources defending themselves—building walls, manning watchtowers,
guarding herds, patrolling ﬁelds. This means less time and energy, fewer
resources, devoted to making food. It could even happen that the greater
productivity of the hours they spend growing and raising food is out-
weighed by the greater number of hours they must spend defending
themselves and the food they have grown—meaning that, all in all, they
produce less food. Indeed, studies of the bones and teeth of some of
the earliest agricultural communities of the Near East show that farm-
ers had worse health (due to poorer nutrition) than the hunter-gatherers
who preceded them.1 Increases in agricultural productivity in later mil-
lennia more than made up for this eventually, but even so, the puzzle
remains: what prompted agriculture to be adopted so quickly and often
within a comparatively short space of time? Agriculture seems to have
been independently adopted in at least seven places: Anatolia, Mexico,
the Andes of South America, northern China, southern China, the east-
ern United States, and sub-Saharan Africa (at least once and possibly
up to four times). Almost certainly the end of the last ice age dramati-
cally improved the productivity of agriculture compared with the hostile
conditions beforehand. But what would that have mattered if all of the
additional beneﬁts of the new farming technology ended up being spent
on defense? Why adopt such a technology at all?2

266 • Prologue to Part IV
We shall never know for sure. The need for communities to defend
themselves sometimes leaves clear traces, in the form of walls and
weapons, but most of the time and energy absorbed by defense leave no
archeological record, so we cannot be certain that this is what explains
the poorer nutrition of the ﬁrst farmers. Still, here’s a reasonable guess.
Agriculture dramatically raised the advantages to mankind of banding
together for self-defense. Once constrained by a sedentary lifestyle and
unable any longer to play hide-and-seek with its enemies, a large group is
much more secure than its members could be in multiple smaller groups.
But the result of devoting time, eﬀort, and resources to defending your-
self is not just to make you feel more secure. It usually also makes your
neighbor feel less secure. And in that simple but grim externality lies
one of the driving forces of modern society, of its stunning technological
achievements as well as its capacity for brutality on an industrial scale.
Once the very ﬁrst farming communities began to invest systemati-
cally in defense, the fact that they could do so began to make them a
threat to their neighbors, including communities who were on the mar-
gins of adopting agriculture themselves. For there is no such thing as
a purely defensive technology. Even walls around a town can make it
easier for attacking parties to travel out to raid nearby communities in
the knowledge they have a secure retreat. The club that prehistoric man
used to ward oﬀattackers was the same club he used to attack others.
Once a community has invested in even a modest army, whether of mer-
cenaries or of its own citizens, the temptation to encourage that army to
earn its keep by preying on weaker neighbors can become overwhelm-
ing. So, even if the ﬁrst farming communities were not necessarily any
better oﬀthan they would have been without agriculture, once the pro-
cess had started, many communities had an interest in joining in. Like
the externalities of congestion and disease we saw earlier among city
dwellers, these interactions could lead each to act ineluctably against
the collective interests of all.
It’s possible that the poorer health of the ﬁrst farmers was due entirely
to a combination of the less varied diet they consumed than hunter-
gatherers had done and the greater risk of disease incurred by living
in more crowded settlements and in closer intimacy with animals. How
large a part was played by their defense needs in explaining their poorer
health is not the main issue here: what matters is that once they adopted
a relatively sedentary lifestyle they set in motion a process of invest-
ment in defense that would change the character of human social living
forever.3

Prologue to Part IV • 267
Part IV sketches the implications of this simple logic of attack and
defense for the structure of modern societies. The double-edged sword
of defense has posed three main threats. The ﬁrst is the threat posed
by communities to their neighbors, a threat that encouraged a spiral of
competitive investment between rivals. The second threat is internal: as
communities became more prosperous and could hand over the task
of defense to others (either to mercenaries or to professional armies of
their own citizens), they could ﬁnd themselves threatened by the very
people upon whose protection they had come to rely. This threat seri-
ously preoccupied some of the great political thinkers of the past, from
the great Tunisian philosopher Ibn Khaldun in the fourteenth century
to the Scottish political economist Adam Ferguson in the eighteenth. As
Ferguson put it in his Essay on the History of Civil Society:
By having separated the arts of the clothier and the tanner, we are the
better supplied with shoes and with cloth. But to separate the arts which
form the citizen and the statesman, the arts of policy and war, is an
attempt to dismember the human character, and to destroy those very
arts which we mean to improve. By this separation, we in eﬀect deprive a
free people of what is necessary for their safety; or we prepare a defense
against invasion from abroad, which gives a prospect of usurpation, and
threatens the establishment of military government at home.4
The third main threat comes from the turbulent and unregulated char-
acter of the very economic prosperity that is the foundation for military
strength. States that have grown prosperous on commerce have realized,
sometimes too late, that the same traders and entrepreneurs who supply
their defense needs are also arming their enemies. The democratic liber-
ality of the division of labor, which arms friends and enemies alike, was
a feature of the warfare of antiquity and continues unabated to this day.
Chapter 16 looks at the way in which the modern state has grown since
its foundation as a simple means of defense among members of seden-
tary agricultural communities. Historically, although the common force
of gravity holding all communities together has been the need to band
together for defense, in dealing with their neighbors societies have faced
a continual choice between two kinds of strategy: strength through pros-
perity and prosperity through strength. Though these represent points
along a continuum rather than a diﬀerence in kind, the ﬁrst has, broadly
speaking, been the strategy of city- and nation-states, the second of
empires. Paradoxically, the more successful states have been in pursuit
of strength through prosperity, the more they have been tempted to

268 • Prologue to Part IV
abandon it in pursuit of prosperity through strength. In this cycle of eco-
nomic growth, military adventurism, political overreach, and subsequent
economic decline lies much of the turbulent dynamic of world history.
The temptation to abandon the strategy of peaceful trade with their
neighbors in favor of impatient conﬁscation is not the only danger faced
by prosperous states. As the tasks undertaken by the state have multi-
plied and grown more complex, the ambition of the state to cure the ills
of the modern division of labor has grown in turn. The state now taxes
and subsidizes, redistributes income, regulates markets, intervenes in
response to unemployment. In short, modern states constrain the oper-
ation of citizens, ﬁrms, and markets in historically unprecedented ways.
These activities have the potential to compensate for the failings of a
society where everyone has tunnel vision and no one is in charge. At
the same time they have increased the need for constraints on what
the state itself can do. For as the task of managing modern society
becomes more complex, the state itself has (necessarily and inevitably)
reproduced within its own internal structure the very division of labor
whose failings it seeks to address. There is no longer a king; instead
there are ﬁnance ministries, regulatory agencies, legislatures, commit-
tees, embassies, consultative bodies, cabinets, courts, lobby groups, each
with their own agenda and given to rivalries outsiders can only guess at.
A president or prime minister still holds life-or-death power, notably to
send citizens to war, but the forces shaping such decisions are the result
of many conﬂicting political pressures and subject to tunnel vision in
ways eerily similar to those of market society itself. This does not make
the state impotent in regulating the market economy, nor is it exactly
a case of the blind leading the blind. But the narrow-sighted lead the
narrow-sighted, in a world in which the long reach and destructiveness
of modern technology require panoramic vision as never before.
Chapter 17 asks where the long experiment begun ten thousand years
ago has brought us at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Global-
ization is not a new phenomenon, though it continually reinvents the dis-
guises it wears. Homo sapiens sapiens has built institutions of startling
complexity that have enabled a hunter-gatherer psychology to dominate
its environment in a way quite unprecedented in nature. Those institu-
tions nevertheless have the potential to do great damage to us and to our
world. Any lasting solutions to these dangers need to be adapted both
to the dangers themselves and to our own hunter-gatherer psychology,
which constrains our ability to respond to them.

Defense and Attack
Eﬀective defense requires teamwork. Each member of a team of ﬁghters
almost always has a much better chance of survival in a battle than its
individual members would on their own. The only important exception
is when ﬁghters are mobile and can survive by running away (as guerrilla
ﬁghters have always known). Then and only then can it be an advantage
to be ﬁghting alone.
When our ancestors began farming and herding, they gave up the
advantages of mobility. It’s true that domesticating sheep, cattle, or pigs
does not bind you as tightly to one place as planting grain does. But it cer-
tainly becomes more costly to ﬂee an enemy, who can then help himself
to your accumulated stores of food, even if these have to be rounded
up rather than just plundered from the storehouse. So the beginning
of agriculture implied almost inevitably that our ancestors would band
together in larger groups than they had previously been used to, even if
these were probably just larger family groups at ﬁrst. Hunter-gatherer
families could easily split up once food got scarce or rivalries and ten-
sions grew diﬃcult to manage, but early farmers knew that splitting up
had become a much more dangerous thing to do. It became more than
ever essential to learn to live with others and to manage conﬂict rather
than to escape it.
Banding together was not just a matter of living in larger groups. It
also implied living physically closer together. If you’re going to stay in
one place, it makes sense for that place to be defended; even a sim-
ple wall or fence can gain you valuable seconds in a ﬁght, as well as
keeping out casual scavengers. And it follows from the laws of simple
geometry that the larger the settlement you are trying to defend, the
greater the area protected per meter of wall (the circumference of a cir-
cle increases with its diameter, but its area increases with the square
of the diameter). So agricultural settlements naturally tended to contain

272 • Chapter 16
more people than hunter-gatherer bands. Yet living together also brings
its challenges—how to share space, how to dispose of waste (as we saw in
chapter 10). Solutions to these problems, like strategies for self-defense,
have the character of public goods, as economists call them. This means
that they apply indiscriminately, more or less, to everyone in the com-
munity, regardless of who has contributed to them. A defensive wall
defends everyone, even the shirkers who tried to avoid being part of the
building crew. A system for disposing of human waste is to everyone’s
beneﬁt, including those who try to avoid the costs of managing it. So
unless there were some arrangement for sharing tasks, backed by the
threat of coercion, everyone would try to free-ride on the eﬀorts of oth-
ers. And such an arrangement implies the concentration and exercise of
power. We can therefore understand how a system of collective order
was the natural consequence of the ﬁrst agricultural revolution.
If the system works, the community prospers. Prosperous commu-
nities soon acquire neighbors, either those envious of their prosperity
(or simply curious about it) or the inhabitants of regions into which
the community expands as its prosperity leads to population growth
and pressure on the limited land. And there are only two main ways
you can behave toward your neighbors: you can ﬁght them, or you can
try to live with them. Historically, communities that successfully fought
their neighbors have slaughtered them, driven them oﬀtheir land, or
enslaved them; sometimes a combination of all three. Communities that
have sought to live with their neighbors have either exchanged goods and
favors actively with them (sometimes resulting in an eventual merger) or
tolerated them while attempting to minimize active contact.
We have no written records to tell us which of these ways of dealing
with neighbors was most common during the several thousands of years
immediately after the invention of agriculture. But we have records of
a diﬀerent kind that can rule out at least some possibilities. The work
of human geneticist Luigi Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues has shown a
remarkable ﬁt between the diﬀusion of agricultural technology (chieﬂy
wheat) from the Middle East to various parts of Europe from 7500 b.c.e.
to around 3000 b.c.e. and the pattern of human genetic variation across
Europe.1 The most reasonable interpretation of this evidence is that
farmers gradually expanded across the continent, at no more than an
average of one kilometer per year for over four thousand years. More
recent radiocarbon dating methods have emphasized that the advance
was much more rapid in certain regions than in others,2 and faster in par-
ticular around the Mediterranean basin than in the northern hinterland.

States and Empires • 273
The farmers interbred with local hunter-gatherer communities, who had
diﬀerent frequencies of certain particular genes that have left traces in
their descendants alive today. For instance, we know that inhabitants
of the Basque region of southwestern France and northern Spain have
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent gene frequencies from those of other Europeans,
indicating that they resisted longer and more successfully against inter-
breeding with migrant agricultural groups from further east (though sig-
niﬁcant interbreeding certainly took place). They also speak a radically
diﬀerent language.
What does this show us? First of all, it makes it unlikely that the
agricultural way of life spread predominantly by cultural emulation, as
hunter-gatherers simply copied the practices of their visibly prosperous
neighbors. On the contrary, these practices were spread by migration:
people and techniques moved together. There was some emulation but
it was emulation of new arrivals who were clearly expanding into the
territory.3 This was not just a European phenomenon: it was true also of
the other instances of agricultural diﬀusion that have so far been stud-
ied, such as the expansion from Mexico southward to the Andes and the
Bantu expansion south- and eastward through Africa beginning about
three thousand years ago.4 Ingenious extraction of DNA evidence from
“quids”—pads of yucca ﬁber used as chewing-gum—has now shown this
to be true also of the expansion of maize agriculture into the American
southwest.5
Secondly, it also makes it unlikely that migrant agriculturalists simply
massacred all those hunter-gatherer communities they found along the
way, or even just drove them permanently oﬀthe land. We don’t know,
of course, how many of the men they massacred even as they sought dili-
gently to impregnate the women.6 Evidence from later societies strongly
suggests that, where agriculture was yielded more than a mere subsis-
tence, many of the captured males would have been put to work as slaves.
Indeed, economic historians have now established that almost no soci-
eties did not enslave others at some time in their history, with slavery
becoming more likely the wealthier the society concerned, at least until
they became wealthy enough to aﬀord to take a stand against slavery on
principle.7
At the same time, though, relations between farmers and their hunter-
gatherer neighbors, as well as between diﬀerent agricultural communi-
ties in the same region, must have oscillated between periodic hostilities
and cautious exchange. Both would have been the product of oppor-
tunism and the random demands of subsistence, the rhythm driven by

reached a signiﬁcant size, the choice between ﬁghting their neighbors

a policy, and one that diﬀerent societies shaped in diﬀerent ways.

around 3000 b.c.e.). But a series of inventions—writing, the wheel, the
domestication of the horse, the combination of the wheel and the horse
to make the chariot, ironworking, brick-making, improved techniques of
building in stone, the sail and the oar, as well as the improved agricul-
tural productivity that allowed farmers to support more nonfarmers—
made it possible to organize societies in larger cities, and to coordinate
the activity of larger and more deadly armies, than had ever been seen
before. Larger cities were themselves a means of raising larger armies,
and larger armies had proportionately much better prospects of success
in battle. This made them a source of fear to their neighbors and ene-
mies and enabled them to extort enough resources from those neighbors
to compensate comfortably for the cost of the armies themselves. The
competitive spiral thereby became more intense, as neighbors drew the
conclusion that the only escape from permanent payment of tribute lay
in having large armies too.
Nevertheless, from as early as the eleventh century b.c.e. and the rise
of the Phoenician city-states, some societies have pursued a diﬀerent

276 • Chapter 16
strategy, of seeking strength through prosperity rather than prosper-
ity through strength. In these, production and trade paid for defense,
and diplomacy (usually fostered by trade) allowed states to call on more
defensive resources than they could aﬀord to employ on a full-time basis.
These societies needed a comparatively high degree of internal coordi-
nation, which limited their size to the territory within which informa-
tion and instructions could be transmitted rapidly—in eﬀect, for more
than two millennia, to the city and its hinterland. Such societies usually
needed to oﬀer their citizens a stake in the collective wealth, even if (as in
the Greek city-states) that wealth was in part made possible by the work
of slaves. They also developed, for the ﬁrst time in history, a substantial
merchant class, which represented the city to the outside world.
It’s important not to misunderstand this distinction: all city-states
were concerned about defense and invested heavily in physical means
of protection. Indeed, defense was the main reason these predominantly
agricultural communities concentrated in urban settlements at all, as
the work of the political scientist Azar Gat has shown.8 What distin-
guished the strategy of strength through prosperity was that it required
treating some of one’s neighbors as resources rather than simply as
threats. City-states articulated, then, an importantly diﬀerent strategy
toward their neighbors from any that had yet been seen on the part of
large organized societies. Some neighbors, at least, were best considered
allies and trading partners rather than enemies, even if their trustwor-
thiness could never be taken for granted. Such a strategy was risky, but
its payoﬀwas potentially vast, not just in economic but even in purely
military terms, as the work of military historian Victor Davis Hanson
has shown.9 Economic strength allowed states to buy the most reliably
lethal weaponry, regardless of where it was produced (including tech-
nologically advanced items such as ships, siege engines, and artillery).
It allowed them to pay for mercenary armies when they were needed.
And, at least as importantly, it provided motivation. Hanson argues that
the Greek city-states were “the ﬁrst consensual governments in the his-
tory of civilization that ﬁelded soldiers who were independent and free
property owners—militiamen, family farmers, and voters all in one.” This
encouraged a preference for decisive pitched battle instead of the skir-
mishes and extended campaigns often favored by their enemies; Greek
citizens “had no wish to be absent from their farms on long campaigns.”
The Greeks elaborated pitched battle into a strategy of murderous eﬀec-
tiveness, as the initial victory of the army in which Xenophon fought at

States and Empires • 277
Cunaxa was to demonstrate, when an entire wing of the Persian army was
destroyed at the price of a single Greek soldier wounded by an arrow.
The Athenians were themselves fully aware how much their military
strength depended on their trading economy. In the ﬁrst book of Thucy-
dides’ history of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles tells his fellow Atheni-
ans that their rivals lack the necessary long purse:
Personally engaged in the cultivation of their lands, without funds
either private or public, the Peloponnesians are also without experience
in long wars across the sea, from the strict limit which poverty imposes
on their attacks upon each other. Powers of this description are quite
incapable of often manning a ﬂeet or often sending out an army: they
cannot aﬀord the absence from their homes, the expenditure from their
own funds. … Capital, it must be remembered, maintains a war more
than forced contributions.10
The paradox was that societies that had sought to build prosperity on
strength became not only less prosperous but even less strong than soci-
eties that conceived the relation the other way round. And yet, once the
strength was there, the temptation to exercise it against weaker neigh-
bors could become overwhelming. Both Athens and Rome outgrew their
city-statehood, and for a long time were able to put their merchant skills
to work in the interests of a more expansionist and imperial project.
Hanson contrasts the economic approach to warfare of Greece and Rome
with the more coercive approach of the armies they faced in battle:
The looting of the Achaemenid treasuries by Alexander the Great
spurred a military renaissance in the eastern Mediterranean for more
than two centuries as relatively small cadres of Greek-speaking dynasts
ruled vast Asiatic populations in Seleucid Asia and Ptolemaic Egypt.
… Rome was the capitalist war machine par excellence of the ancient
world [with an] intricate system of logistical supply contracted out to
private businessmen. … The alternative to capitalist-ﬁnanced warfare
was either simple coercion—the forced impressments of warriors with-
out pay—or tribal musters fueled by promises of booty. Both systems
could result in enormous and spirited armies: Vercingetorix’s quarter-
million-man Gallic army that nearly defeated Caesar at Alesia (52 bc)
and the nomadic invasions of Genghis Khan (1206–27) and Tamerlane
(1381–1405), who overran much of Asia, are the most notable examples.
… But even the most murderous hordes could not sustain—feed, clothe
and pay—a military force with sophisticated weaponry for a lengthy
period of time. At some point farmers, traders and merchants do not
work if they are not paid.11

278 • Chapter 16
Put this way, as a matter of simple incentives, the point may seem obvi-
ous. What was not obvious to many of the world’s early political leaders
was that societies unwilling to treat at least some of their neighbors as
partners rather than as enemies would never be able to build up the
capital to underwrite a successful long-term military project in the ﬁrst
place.
Three Flaws in the Commercial Strategy
During the last ﬁve thousand years, the competition between states
and empires (the former founded substantially on commerce, the latter
substantially on coercion) has undergone many ﬂuctuations of fortune,
not unlike the competition between ﬁrms that was discussed in chap-
ter 13. Successful city-states sometimes metamorphosed into empires,
and unsuccessful empires fell apart into squabbling states. Some schol-
ars, such as Paul Kennedy, writing about the period since 1500, have seen
an inherent dynamic in which imperial success led intrinsically to over-
reach, because the kinds of investment required to maintain an empire
were incompatible with the kinds of investment needed to maintain the
commercial foundations of their military success.12 Be that as it may (and
Hanson’s description of the Greek empire in the eastern Mediterranean
suggests that imperial overreach might sometimes take a long time to
set in), the process was also highly dependent on chance—a point also
emphasized for the period after 1400 by the historian John Darwin.13
Whether states could survive against the depredations of empires, for
instance, has depended not just on the skill of their diplomacy but also
on changes in oﬀensive and defensive technology. The training of horses
to carry armored ﬁghters, the development of the trireme in Athens,
and the organizational innovations of the Roman state (including those
famous roads) all tilted the balance in favor of scale, and therefore of
empires; improved building in stone and the invention of the crossbow
and longbow tilted it back in favor of small defensive formations, and
therefore of states.
Many apparently small developments could have large and distant
consequences: the historian Lynn White suggested that the humble stir-
rup (an invention imported from Asia) made possible large-scale com-
bat between mounted knights in Europe and thereby laid the founda-
tions of feudalism.14 White’s theory is no longer taken seriously in its
original form, but it is not disputed that the stirrup had consequences
out of all proportion to its size. Changes in the cost of transport and

States and Empires • 279
communication over large distances could make a crucial diﬀerence to
the viability of empires (the collapse of the Roman empire fed upon itself
as the impoverished regions were no longer able to aﬀord the upkeep
of the infrastructure that had kept the empire together). Organizational
innovations counted as much as physical ones; for example, the census,
which was instituted by both the Chinese and the Roman empires and
was systematically implemented by the nation-states of Europe in the
early modern period in their attempts to consolidate their political, geo-
graphical, and above all ﬁscal hold over their territories. Along with the
census came the innovation of personal surnames, ﬁrst imposed on the
population in China in around the fourth century b.c.e. and attempted
many times elsewhere in the world in subsequent centuries, not always
successfully.15 Indeed, whether a state was capable of standardizing
surnames was as much a test of organizational capacity as a means of
achieving it.
Many innovations had highly ambivalent consequences for the contest
between states and empires: an innovation might favor states initially
but empires in the course of time. Before 1000 b.c.e. the Phoenicians’
remarkable mastery of shipbuilding had laid the foundations of their
trading economy, but these same skills were later to be reﬁned for mil-
itary as well as trading purposes by their Greek and Roman rivals. This
shows that although the strategy of building a commercial foundation
for military strength has proved, over the millennia, spectacularly more
successful than the rival strategy of building a purely military founda-
tion for economic strength, it is a strategy with a major ﬂaw.
The Danger of Disparity in Strength
In fact it has three major ﬂaws, each of them due to the fact that even
defensive technologies always have some potential for being used in
attack. The ﬁrst ﬂaw is that wealthy states can become a source of fear
to their neighbors, since the strategy of trading with those neighbors
rather than ﬁghting them may not outlast the emergence of a major dis-
parity in military strength. And insecure neighbors are not necessarily
good news. They divert resources from peaceful investments that might
help both parties toward expensive and dangerous military technology,
and they can be tempted by opportunities to strike preemptively in order
to forestall the risk of facing a preemptive strike themselves. It was the
insecurity of Sparta in the face of Athens’s growing prosperity that led
to the Peloponnesian War. The popular modern view that trade between

280 • Chapter 16
neighbors makes warfare less likely (a view central to the establishment
of the European Economic Community in Western Europe after World
War II) is one that has no reliable basis in history.16 We can be sure that
the only reasonable alternative to warfare between neighbors is indeed
trade, but that does not mean that trade by itself is a signiﬁcant assur-
ance of stability.
Even when immediate neighbors establish a reasonable, if temporary,
equilibrium between themselves, there are always more distant neigh-
bors who can be threatened. The imperial ambitions of the Western
European nations over the last ﬁve hundred years have been particularly
intense at periods of delicately balanced rivalry between those imperial
powers, whether we look at the sixteenth, the late eighteenth, or the later
nineteenth centuries. Nor have attempts to “civilize” the process on the
part of the rivals themselves necessarily helped the neighbors. The Euro-
pean powers abolished the transatlantic slave trade in the early nine-
teenth century, but the systematic slaughter of indigenous inhabitants
of their colonies continued. These included the aboriginal inhabitants of
Australia and Tasmania (the latter of whom were entirely wiped out), the
Hereros of German Southwest Africa (now Namibia) in 1904,17 and what
may possibly be the largest single genocide in history, the killing of up
to ten million Congolese by Belgian colonists between 1880 and 1920—a
startling average of one murder every two minutes, day and night, for
forty years.18
Military strategists have long known that a disparity in strength be-
tween rivals—and especially a growing disparity in strength—is the most
important single reason to expect an outbreak of hostilities. Intriguingly,
a similar explanation has been advanced for one of the puzzles of animal
behavior, namely, the much greater frequency of violence among adults
of some species than among others. Chimpanzees (like lions, wolves, and
spotted hyenas) regularly kill other adults of their own species; gorillas,
like most other animals, very rarely do. Yet their propensity for violence
as such is about equal. Gorillas—again, like many other species—engage
in high rates of infanticide (for instance, one in seven of the infants
recorded at Dian Fossey’s site in Rwanda were judged to have been killed
by adult gorillas). Infanticide is common in nature, but killing of adults
is rare, and for a simple reason: infants are overwhelmingly weaker than
adults. So it is not surprising that the species where killing of adults reg-
ularly occurs are those in which the accidents of foraging behavior reg-
ularly lead to meetings between groups of unequal size and strength.19
Chimpanzees, operating within an environment where the most eﬀective

States and Empires • 281
group size varies according to the particular task, and where groups
will wander in pursuit of food in exploratory and unpredictable ways
over a wide area, are one such species. Human beings, unfortunately,
are another. Although a move toward a sedentary agricultural existence
at any time in the last ten thousand years might temporarily have slowed
the wanderings of any one particular group, the resulting migrations as
population growth took oﬀ, as well as the strikingly diﬀerent size and
strength of cities and states, dramatically multiplied both the opportu-
nities and the incentives for warfare. In our own century, globalization
may be doing something similar—a point that will be taken up again in
chapter 14. And the enormous disparity in military strength between the
United States and all other countries that has emerged since the end of
the Cold War has proved to be bad news even for the United States itself,
a point to which I shall return.
Soldiers and Civilians
The second ﬂaw in the strategy of building strength through prosperity
is that a successful commercial strategy of defense requires, like a suc-
cessful commercial strategy for anything else, a division of labor between
specialists and the rest. As Ibn Khaldun pointed out so clearly six cen-
turies ago (and Adam Ferguson again nearly four centuries after him),
when a society hands over military decisions to professional soldiers in
order to get on with building prosperity, those soldiers wield immense
power over those whom they have been asked to protect. Over and over
again, that power has been used, not always to kill or enslave, but at
the least to tax or extort (these last two terms meaning often the same
thing). The philosopher Thomas Hobbes famously argued that the abso-
lute power of a single monarch was better than the contested power of
rivalrous local gangsters. Hobbes lived in a period of intense and bloody
rivalry between the European powers (he claimed that his mother had
given birth to him in fright at the coming of the Spanish Armada in
1588). His great work Leviathan was published shortly after the end
of the Thirty Years’ War, one of the bloodiest episodes of ﬁghting to
which the European continent had ever been subjected. This suggests
that Hobbes was so alive to the human costs of rivalry between politi-
cal powers that he underplayed the costs of inequality in power within
states, costs that were to preoccupy political thought in subsequent cen-
turies. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the problem of how to con-
strain the exercise of power within the state has come to be seen as the

282 • Chapter 16
central problem of political philosophy in the modern era (the accidents
of intellectual terminology mean that the problem of constraining the
exercise of power between states is no longer considered philosophical
at all but falls under the disciplinary heading of international relations).
The Arms Bazaar
Both of these ﬂaws in the strategy of commercial states have been horri-
bly exposed by the political and military evolution of the world’s nation-
states in recent centuries. But there is a third ﬂaw, no less deadly, of
which the Greeks themselves were well aware, and which threatens us in
the modern world as much as either of the ﬁrst two. A successful com-
mercial strategy for defense requires, as part of the division of labor,
that those who invent, design, and build weapons should be given con-
siderable freedom. It needs commercial rivalry, room for the maverick,
the ingenious but unexpected solution. And free designers will sell to
whoever will pay them. Victor Hanson writes that in Athens “the impe-
tus was largely capitalistic and democratic: designers were free to proﬁt
by building better weapons than their competitors, while rulers sought
to arm as many of their subjects as possible as cheaply and lethally as
possible.”20 Another historian, Edward Cohen, points out that maritime
commerce in Athens was “characterized by extreme market fragmenta-
tion: there existed at Athens no single owner of a multi-ship ﬂeet, no
dominant trading companies, no enterprise controlling the harbor.”21
Even during the Dark and Middle Ages in Europe, writes Hanson, “Euro-
peans were adept at fabricating a variety of superior military goods in
great numbers, from plate armor to matchless double-edged swords,
crossbows and Greek ﬁre, prompting many states to publish decrees
forbidding their merchants from exporting such arms to potential ene-
mies.” One example of such a decree was that published in 1198 by Pope
Innocent III excommunicating “those who presume to give arms, iron, or
wood to the Saracens for their galleys.”
These export controls did not work. They have never worked when
strong enough economic interests are at stake. Indeed, Pope Innocent
himself was lobbied by Venetian trading interests to relax his decree. He
replied in a spirit of compromise in this letter to the city of Venice:
Our beloved sons Andreas Donatus and Benedict Grilion, your messen-
gers, recently came to the apostolic see and were at pains to explain to
us that by this decree your city was suﬀering no small loss, for she is
not devoted to agriculture but rather to shipping and to commerce. We,

States and Empires • 283
therefore, induced by the paternal aﬀection we have for you, and com-
manding you under pain of anathema not to aid the Saracens by selling
or giving to them or exchanging with them iron, ﬂax, pitch, pointed
stakes, ropes, arms, helmets, ships, and boards, or unﬁnished wood,
do permit for the present, until we issue further orders, the taking of
goods, other than those mentioned, to Egypt and Babylon, whenever
necessary. We hope that in consideration of this kindness you will bear
in mind the aiding of Jerusalem, taking care not to abuse the apostolic
decree, for there is no doubt that whosoever violates his conscience in
evading this order will incur the anger of God.22
The failure of export controls was not just an incidental blemish on
Europe’s statecraft. Far from it: the continual rivalry between producers
and exporters of technology (notably, though not exclusively, military
technology) was one of the main motors of Europe’s remarkable eco-
nomic development in the medieval and early modern periods. David
Landes contrasts the diﬀerent approaches of Europe and Ming dynasty
China. In spite of having invented gunpowder,
the Chinese never learned to make modern guns. Worse yet, having
known and used cannon as early as the thirteenth century, they had let
knowledge and skill slip away. Their city walls and gates had emplace-
ments for cannon, but no cannon. Who needed them? No enemy of
China had them. … [However] no European nation would have been
deterred from armament by enemy weakness; when it came to death,
Europeans maximized.23
The underlying logic of military exports is that developing military
technology takes a lot of investment and creates a strong incentive to
sell as much of the resulting equipment as possible to recoup that ﬁxed
investment. This is as true now, in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, as it has
ever been. Like their medieval predecessors, the most ingenious engi-
neers in the world’s most powerful nations compete to sell the products
of their defense industries to other countries, many of whom will even-
tually use the weapons against their erstwhile benefactors.
The ﬁve major arms-exporting countries together exported nearly $18
billion of conventional armaments in 2008 (in 1990 prices), according to
oﬃcial ﬁgures reported by the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute.24 Naturally, this is dwarfed by total military spending across
the world, estimated at over $1,400 billion dollars in the same year: much
military expenditure consists of paying wages rather than buying hard-
ware. However, it is almost certainly an underestimate, as it does not
include military equipment smuggled or stolen or simply underreported,

284 • Chapter 16
of which there is certainly a great deal. The most dangerous weaponry is
not always the most obviously destructive, because there is a trade-oﬀ
between size and ease of concealment. Aircraft carriers are very destruc-
tive but hard to hide in a suitcase, while the proliferation of small arms
around the world will almost certainly cost more lives in the next few
decades than all other categories of weaponry put together, unless there
is a large-scale nuclear war.
As with the ﬁrst hunter-gatherers, the overall result of the world’s
defense spending is to make us all less secure and to divert energy,
resources, and inventiveness that could have been put to more peace-
ful and productive ends; there is good evidence that a country’s eco-
nomic performance suﬀers when defense spending is escalated.25 But
as with the ﬁrst hunter-gatherers, this does not mean the countries that
do so are being foolish. Again, the evidence suggests that they spend on
weapons when they face a threat, and that spending on weapons makes
better sense for each country than simply hoping the threat will recede
on its own.26 That is why simple appeals to the prudence of individual
countries will never be enough to bring the world’s military expenditures
down to a less dangerous level, for most individual countries are behav-
ing reasonably, even if in the process they are making each other less
secure.
Of course, not all defense expenditure need make your neighbors inse-
cure. Some weapons have greater defensive than oﬀensive potential, and
some are designed expressly never to be used. But arms exporters are,
above all, businessmen (and women). And businessmen know that, as a
rule, there is more money to be made from selling equipment to people
who intend to use it than to people who don’t.
The Business of Government
Of course, the business of government in the twenty-ﬁrst century in-
volves much, much more than defense. Although the ﬁgures are sen-
sitive to the exact deﬁnitions used, to ﬂuctuations from year to year,
and to conjectures about the size of the black economy, the share of
national income taken in taxes by the government in the rich countries
of the world varies from around a third in Japan and the United States to
more than two-ﬁfths in Western Europe and around a half in France and
Scandinavia. A signiﬁcant part of this involves transfers, from taxpay-
ers to others, principally recipients of public pensions, unemployment,
and social security beneﬁts, but also beneﬁciaries of a range of subsidies

States and Empires • 285
from arts grants to export credits for—yes—arms producers. And if we
look just at that part of economic activity that involves consumption of
goods and services (excluding both transfers and investment), govern-
ment in rich countries takes around 20 per cent, while in poor countries
it takes around 16 per cent. Both shares are a lot higher than they were
in previous centuries (even poor countries have beneﬁted from modern
technology for tax collection and social control). Nevertheless, the power
of political command is underwritten in all countries by military power,
and the power of political command is in turn at the heart of the power
to tax, to spend, and to regulate.
This does not mean governments always get what they want. Indeed,
as was described in chapter 1, even governments with massive military
potential are often strangely powerless to control the detail of events
around them, and the greater the commercial vigor of a nation the more
it is likely to be diverse, decentralized, and resistant to control. Nev-
ertheless, governments have sought to regulate activity in a multitude
of ways, for good reasons and bad. Chapter 10 showed how the pollu-
tion and disease of cities has provoked a range of responses to ensure a
cleaner environment at the local level. This has not come about princi-
pally through altruism, but rather through the recognition that external-
ities between the powerful and the powerless bind their fates together.
Unless cities are made more healthy for the poor, they will become unin-
habitable even by the rich. Similarly, the moves to democratize political
systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries often sprang not from
the generosity or goodwill of the politically powerful but from their fear
of revolution if demands for democracy were not met (“Reform, that you
may preserve,” as Macaulay put it during the passage of the Great Reform
Act of 1832).27
Yet, like the very societies they seek to regulate, the regulatory policies
of all governments have come into being less as the product of a coherent
vision than as a series of responses to immediate problems. The busi-
ness of government is just as much subject to a division of labor as is
the business of everything else. Central governments operate with only
a cloudy vision of what is happening in local governments (that’s one of
the reasons why local governments can do some things so much better
than central governments can). Even within central governments, oﬃ-
cials in agriculture ministries know next to nothing about transport regu-
lation; central banks are increasingly given constitutional independence
from oversight by government; competition authorities get on with their
job without liaising with ministries of labor or ministries of defense.

286 • Chapter 16
Sometimes this is the inevitable result of the scale of the task and the
consequent need for specialists: a government of amateurs regulating
an economy full of specialists would be left hopelessly behind. Some-
times it is the result of a belief that some tasks need consistency and
independence from the day-to-day lobbying that accompanies all gov-
ernment activity. Central banking and competition regulation, like the
judicial system, depend not just on making wise decisions but on send-
ing credible and consistent signals to the rest of society, signals whose
very credibility might be undermined by an obviously political process
of implementation. The people charged with these tasks tend, therefore,
to be appointed in ways that insulate them from the pressures of daily
politics that operate elsewhere in the system. Those pressures of daily
politics are themselves the product of multiple conﬂicting initiatives,
by voters, lobbyists, party activists, elected representatives, journalists,
all people with axes to grind, careers to make, families to worry about,
grudges to nurse. Government in a complex modern society is unimag-
inable in any other way.
These are all good, indeed unanswerable, arguments. But when we
worry about where the division of labor in society may be leading us, we
should be wary of supposing that the intervention of government over-
comes the problem rather than posing it anew, albeit sometimes in a
more tractable form. Collective action—politics, in a word—reproduces
through its own operation the very division of labor whose failings it
seeks to redress. It comes with its own version of the virtues and vices—
creativity, ﬂexibility, tunnel vision—which have made such a spectacu-
lar contribution to human development but which simultaneously pose
threats to the future of that development. Over the haphazard web
of loosely coordinated exchanges between private individuals it lays
another haphazard web of loosely coordinated exchanges between coali-
tions of politically minded individuals. Have we any assurance that the
proposed solution is any more reassuring than the original problem?
Faced with poverty, war, and damage to the fabric of our planet,
many of the world’s citizens at the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst cen-
tury are convinced that conventional solutions have failed. Broadcasting
and telecommunications have made us aware of problems more seri-
ous than any to which conventional political processes can promise an
answer. In response, many citizens are seeking to bypass these political
processes, preferring to demonstrate on the streets outside international
political meetings rather than inﬂuence those meetings through the ordi-
nary mechanisms of voting, lobbying, and arguing with political leaders

States and Empires • 287
face to face. The very globalization that enables citizens to be aware of
the plight of others on the far side of the world, as well as to organize
pressure groups with worldwide reach, seems to many of those citizens
to have run out of control. The ﬁnancial crisis that has erupted since
2007 only reinforces the conviction of many that the scale and complex-
ity of the modern world have been allowed to develop beyond reasonable
limits.
Are they right? Has the great experiment launched by Homo sapiens
sapiens ten thousand years ago reached its tolerable limits? And is it
even conceivable to call a halt?

Globalization and Political Action
Solidarity and Difference
Imagine a world in which entire communities make a living by digging
strawberry ice cream of the ﬁnest quality out of the northern tundra
and processing it to extract the strawberries. Further south, hitherto
unknown societies ﬁnd outstanding vintage wine ﬂowing in streams and
process it to remove the alcohol and recover the natural grape juice. If we
were to discover such people, we would no doubt welcome this expan-
sion of the world’s ethnographic riches and think them worthy at least
of a full-color spread in the National Geographic. But, if we could think
beyond the exoticism, we would be aware also that they represented a
marvelous business opportunity.
At least, let’s hope we would. Such a response to the discovery of
people with tastes so diﬀerent from ours might seem sordidly commer-
cial, but it would be a major improvement upon the reaction of many
of our forebears. The discovery of people controlling a resource that
we value more than they do has led, only too often, to their murder
or enslavement. Even in the absence of slavery or genocide, what Adam
Smith famously described as the human propensity to “truck, barter and
exchange” has always coexisted uneasily with a rival temptation to take,
bully, and extort. Smith was an extraordinarily wise and decent man who
nevertheless shocked many of his contemporaries by what they saw as
his cynical praise for the virtues of solid economic self-interest. In one
respect, though, Smith was far from cynical enough, for he drew too little
attention to the fragility of the commercial motive in the face of more
brutal temptations. Yet he lived in times that were bloody enough, and
whose bloodiness sometimes had global consequences. Thus Macaulay
unforgettably described Frederick the Great, provoker of (among many
others) the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, when Adam Smith
was a young man arriving to begin his studies at Oxford: “In order that
he might rob a neighbour whom he had promised to defend, black men

Globalization and Political Action • 289
fought on the coast of Coromandel and red men scalped each other by
the great lakes of North America.”1 Smith himself made many references
in his writings to war and its consequences, though these do not seem to
have dented his conﬁdence in the strength of human beings’ willingness
to cut deals.
Romantic conservatives throughout the ages, from Plato through
Edmund Burke and Thomas Carlyle down to some of the more high-
minded critics of globalization in our own time, such as John Gray,2
have disdained the commercial spirit as vulgar and philistine. Some have
evidently nursed an admiration for the manlier virtues (Burke famously
described the young Queen Marie Antoinette of France in the language
of a hazy, semierotic daydream, bemoaning the fact that “ten thousand
swords” had not “leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look
that threatened her with insult,” and concluding mournfully that “the
age of chivalry is gone; that of sophisters, economists and calculators
has succeeded, and the glory of Europe is vanished for ever”3). Yet the
manlier virtues have been yoked countless times to the service of murder
and extortion, while exchange with someone who is diﬀerent from us,
though it may lack panache, is, in the end, the only civilized thing to do.
We can exchange poetry and works of art if we wish (and if they don’t pre-
fer Coca-Cola), but exchange we must. The problem of civilized society,
though, is how to turn the propensity to truck, barter, and exchange into
something stronger than a propensity—into a habit, into second nature.
Second nature is the best we can hope for since, as modern evolutionary
biology has now shown us (and as Adam Smith was never in a position
to know), it is a long way from being our ﬁrst.
The fantasy of a people who mine ice cream is of course an invention,
but less bizarre than it might seem. For all over the world there are peo-
ple trying to transform, escape, or get rid of things that other people
somewhere else are no less keenly trying to acquire: Bangladeshis who
have too much water while Bedouins have far too little, European farm-
ers accumulating wheat surpluses while Ethiopian children go hungry,
tourists on beaches soaking up the sun that the locals are wisely try-
ing to avoid. It is diﬀerences that make for a common interest between
strangers, diﬀerences that give us reasons to exchange. Sometimes, those
diﬀerences just come about through the accidents of natural bounty;
they provide each side with a “comparative advantage” in trade, as David
Ricardo expressed it nearly two centuries ago.4 Sometimes they are just
the result of specialization among people who are otherwise pretty much
alike. But often they reﬂect diﬀerences of taste, outlook, or vision of the

290 • Chapter 17
world, diﬀerences that give us more reason, rather than less, to exchange.
The expression “de gustibus non est disputandum” is best seen as an
injunction to think of diﬀerences in tastes as an opportunity rather than
a threat.
If violence in the human species were an isolated and individual aﬀair,
we could perhaps be optimistic that the more diﬀerent people were, the
more the gains from exchange would provide a reason to trade rather
than ﬁght. But human violence, like that among chimpanzees, is not
only or even mainly the result of quarrels between individuals. It is also,
systematically and spectacularly, about violence between groups, whose
individuals cooperate among themselves to inﬂict violence more lethally
and cruelly than they could ever do on their own. Groups need to excite
and exploit in the service of violence the very same capacity for coop-
eration that, in other contexts, is the foundation for peace. They do so
by emphasizing the similarities among members of the group and their
diﬀerences from outsiders. They identify convictions (ideas and beliefs
shared and reinforced by the group) as diﬀerent from purely individ-
ual tastes and claim that diﬀerences of conviction provide an excellent
reason to ﬁght. But why should this work? There’s an obvious reason
for the emphasis on similarity: it allows groups of unrelated individuals
to trigger emotions that evolution has favored for the greater cohesion
of kin groups (we talk of brothers, sisters, a fatherland). The reason for
the emphasis on diﬀerence with outsiders is also obvious: evolution has
favored ways of targeting our violence toward those who are likely to be
unrelated to us and therefore our genetic rivals rather than our allies.
These emotions may have served genetic survival during our evolution-
ary history, but today they threaten the physical survival of everyone.
Globalization and Its Legacy
As the twenty-ﬁrst century develops, “globalization” has become a con-
venient catch-all term to sum up the multitude of diﬀerent, often con-
tradictory reasons people have to feel uneasy about the way in which
world events are developing. It is widely discussed as though it were a
phenomenon of the last few years, even though it has been going on, in
one way or another, for much of the last ten thousand years, with waves
of intensiﬁcation beginning ﬁve thousand, two and a half thousand, and
ﬁve hundred years ago, again around a century and a half ago, and yet
again after World War II. In the country where I live, France, politicians
who all bear the indelible marks of globalization in the clothes they wear,

Globalization and Political Action • 291
the food they eat, the books they read, the technology they use, all nev-
ertheless agree that globalization is a bad thing, even when they agree
about very little else.
Although, as we have seen, globalization poses some serious risks to
the future of the planet, it’s as well to be reminded of the spectacular
beneﬁts it has brought to humankind.5 Studying the societies of the past
with the same degree of statistical rigor as we can apply to modern states
is not easy. But one important study by the economists François Bour-
guignon and Christian Morrison has tried to estimate the evolution of
world income—both its average level and its distribution between rich
and poor—over the nearly two centuries since the end of the Napoleonic
Wars.6 Comparing real incomes in the past with those of today is not
straightforward, since many things that are available even in poor coun-
tries today (electricity, for instance) simply did not exist in past eras.
But we can make comparisons in terms of marketable goods and ser-
vices (food, clothes, housing) that form the bulk of the expenditure of
the poor now as they have always done. And the picture Bourguignon and
Morrison paint is very striking. A little under a quarter of the world’s pop-
ulation lives today in conditions of extreme poverty, which they deﬁne
as living on less than a dollar per person per day. This is an awful fact
about the modern world, but there is nothing speciﬁcally modern about
such poverty. On the contrary, Bourguignon and Morrison estimate that
around 84 per cent of the world’s population lived in such conditions in
1820. We do not hear much about them, since the novels, diaries, and
journalism that inﬂuence our perception of that historical period were
written by the rich. When the poor appear in the novels of the nine-
teenth century (by writers such as Balzac, Dickens, and Victor Hugo),
they are usually the urban poor, whose factory-blackened clothes and
bodies suggest an indictment of the industrial system that was also a
product of globalization. The rural poor, who suﬀered in their hundreds
of millions from malnutrition, disease, and early death without going
anywhere near a factory, have largely been written out of the script. We
need to remember: at all previous stages in the great globalizing exper-
iment launched ten thousand years ago by Homo sapiens sapiens, the
overwhelming majority of people were desperately poor, and their lives
were grim.
More striking even than the picture painted by statistics about real
incomes is the evidence that being poor implied in the past a much
greater risk of disease and early death. Remember what was said in chap-
ter 10 about Italy’s level of infant mortality on the eve of World War II,

292 • Chapter 17
as high as Uganda’s is today. This is not an isolated case. In 1860 the
rich countries of today had incomes between around $1,300 and $3,200
per person in today’s prices. That’s between Ghana and Romania on a
modern scale. Yet Romania’s infant mortality today is around 2 per cent
and Ghana’s around 7 per cent; while in the developed countries in 1860
infant mortality lay between 14 per cent (for Sweden) and 26 per cent (for
Austria). Reducing infant mortality for the poor has been one of human-
ity’s remarkable achievements—due not to a magic bullet like the inven-
tion of antibiotics but to steady, sustained progress in hygiene, nutrition,
and waste disposal as well as the diﬀusion of medical knowledge across
the world as a whole.
It is true that the progress of globalization may threaten some of the
world’s more poetic idiosyncrasies. On the streets of the cities and towns
of South India, women can buy lengths of ﬁne cord threaded with tiny
jasmine ﬂowers to put in their hair. The scent of jasmine from the crowds
around me, caught on an evening breeze otherwise laden with the nox-
ious smells of the city, is one of the most exhilarating memories I have
of India, yet it is possible principally because of the labor of children
whose ﬁngers are nimble enough to thread the ﬂowers at a speed that
makes the operation proﬁtable. When India’s poor have become more
prosperous, there will be many fewer children willing to do such work,
but the disappearance of their handiwork is something it would be hard
honestly to regret. It will not be the only casualty of prosperity, but we
should be clear that if globalization causes its disappearance, that will
be counted among globalization’s successes, not among its failures.
It is sometimes startling to compare the resentful rhetoric about eco-
nomic and social openness of present-day politicians with the language
of societies in the past that we usually consider to have been more closed
than our own. Pericles told Athenians in his funeral oration:
We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts exclude
foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although the
eyes of an enemy may occasionally proﬁt by our liberality; trusting less
in system and policy than to the native spirit of our citizens; while in
education, where our rivals from their very cradles by a painful disci-
pline seek after manliness, at Athens we live exactly as we please, and
yet are just as ready to encounter every legitimate danger.7
It is a noble and attractive vision, even if the slave-owning, misogynis-
tic, perpetually warring city-state in which he lived was a long way from
being a modern model of openness to outsiders.8 But there is pathos in

Globalization and Political Action • 293
his ﬁnal clause. Athens lost the Peloponnesian War, and the fragility of
a political and economic system founded on exchange between indepen-
dent states has haunted the world ever since.
Politics and Group Loyalty
So what does politics have to oﬀer in the face of this fragility? Modern
democratic politics is an opportunistic compromise between the talents
of man the reasoner and user of symbolic knowledge and man the emo-
tional loyalist of the hunter-gatherer band. Many of the day-to-day tasks
of government, at least in reasonably functional industrial states, are
undertaken according to a set of rules, framed in terms of abstract cat-
egories that are independent of the particular individual applying them.
A civil service is the epitome of symbolic reasoning, even if its actual
functioning often falls short of the austere objectivity prescribed by the
ideal. But the political process itself rarely even aims at such objectivity.
Politicians explicitly aim to trigger the emotional responses of the fam-
ily group, and the resources of television have now strengthened their
ability to do so even beyond what used to be possible in the meeting hall
or the stadium. A politician speaking on television is cultivating the illu-
sion of speaking to each individual viewer as a kinsman or a friend. The
viewer’s brain may not be fooled, but the brain may not be the target.
Her subliminal responses will be inﬂuenced, just as during human evo-
lution our ancestors were inﬂuenced to respond warmly to smiles and to
laughter, as we saw in chapter 4. “Trust me,” says the smiling politician,
and we relax a little. “Brothers and sisters,” says the concerned-looking
politician, and we become concerned in turn, serious, ready for sacriﬁce.
A reference to the fatherland tugs at our reserves of loyalty—how could
we be so churlish as to withhold our cooperation now?
Politicians are not alone in this; modern business uses similar tech-
niques to sell its products. Why should the fact that a celebrity endorses
a car or a telephone make any diﬀerence to whether we shall decide to
buy it? Because celebrities give us the illusion of being people we know.
They also tap into our wish to belong to powerful and high-status groups
and imply to us that by buying the badge that distinguishes members
from the rest, we can somehow make it more likely that we really do
belong. Our desire for group membership can be very strong: the attrac-
tion of high-status groups is self-evident, but in many circumstances
even weak, low-status groups can seem more attractive than the solitary
life. It must have served us well during our evolution, since it discouraged

294 • Chapter 17
us from leaving the bands of our relatives even when personal relations
were proving diﬃcult. But it’s a wish that makes us vulnerable to manip-
ulative advertising in the very diﬀerent circumstances of today.9 None
of this means, as Vance Packard’s book The Hidden Persuaders argued
several decades ago, that advertisers and the ﬁrms that pay them are all-
powerful.10 After all, they compete against each other for our custom,
and we are not passive stooges. Natural selection has also endowed us
with brains that can reﬂect upon our own emotional vulnerabilities.
Nor is this to say that the daily trickery of politics is always to be
deplored. Some of it may serve the interests of prosperity and peace.
But the fact that similar emotions can be harnessed to both peaceful
and aggressive ends means that we cannot tell from the quality of the
emotional interaction alone what its overall social consequences will be.
When we send our ﬁttest young men to perform in international ath-
letic contests or football tournaments, with politicians declaring their
support for the brave youngsters and coordinating displays of patriotic
solidarity, are we honing the instincts of warriors or enacting a parody
of warfare to divert those instincts from a yearning for the real thing?
When politicians declare war on an abstract noun like poverty, drugs, or
unemployment, how close are they to mobilizing support for real wars,
with real victims?
When the triggers of loyalty within a group work at the expense of
cooperation between groups, everyone may lose out. The economist and
political scientist Leonard Wantchekon performed a brilliant political
experiment in his native Benin, when he persuaded rival political par-
ties in the 2001 presidential election campaign to allow him to select a
number of diﬀerent villages to try out the eﬀects of political programs
that appealed to the general interests of the nation, as opposed to those
that spoke about the same issues (health, unemployment, and so on) in
explicitly partisan terms, promising voters in one place jobs and beneﬁts
even though these would be at the expense of jobs and beneﬁts for voters
elsewhere. The results were clear, and disturbing. When parties oﬀered
programs appealing to general interests, they received fewer votes than
when they oﬀered partisan programs. Perhaps the voters thought such
partisan programs were more credible (because easier to fulﬁll). At all
events, the experiment conﬁrmed what many political scientists have
long feared: that campaigning in partisan terms, to exploit the loyalty
of a group by fanning its rivalry with other groups, may be a strategy
that pays oﬀfor the individual politician even if it is damaging for the
political system as a whole.11

Globalization and Political Action • 295
So where does this leave general ideas and noble principles? Does a
vision of politics based on evolutionary nostalgia, on the emotions of the
hunter-gatherer, have any room for them?
Liberalism and Its History
One of the most powerful political ideas to surface in the modern world
was liberalism. Most accounts of liberalism would date its origins to
between roughly ﬁve hundred and roughly three hundred years ago,
according to whether they date the birth of an idea to its ﬁrst major
visible inﬂuence or to its being explicitly written down. Five hundred
years ago saw the discovery of the New World and the birth of Protes-
tantism (Martin Luther’s stand before the Diet of Worms took place in
1521). And just over three hundred years ago, between 1689 and 1692,
John Locke published his Two Treatises of Government, and his three
Letters on Toleration. In between, much had happened: the early forms
of capitalism had appeared; the English Civil War and its horrible Euro-
pean counterpart, the Thirty Years’ War, had been fought. Historians
have argued at length about the precise nature of the furnace in which
liberalism was forged, but most agree that it is a product of the modern,
capitalist, Christian West.
Like most political philosophies, liberalism comprises both a vision of
the human condition and a set of ideas and values to live by. In spite
of diﬀerences about the details, there are strong common themes in the
values advanced by various liberal writers. These comprise:
• Core values—liberty most obviously, but also, and to varying deg-
rees, equality and pluralism.
• A procedure for moral reasoning—such as the social contract of
Locke and Rousseau, or the “veil of ignorance” proposed by Rawls12
—whose purpose is to undermine the perceived arbitrariness of
appeals to tradition or authority.
• A set of constitutional recommendations to safeguard the core val-
ues, such as universal suﬀrage or a bill of rights.
• A program for political reform, whose content depends on current
political circumstances but which always aims to remove existing
threats to the exercise of liberty.
The vision of the human condition embodied in liberalism is the fruit
partly of a natural psychology, an account of how human beings think
and feel. It is also partly the fruit of a view of their social predicament,

296 • Chapter 17
a story about why human beings who think and feel this way ﬁnd them-
selves often in conﬂict, and what may be done to resolve conﬂicts in a
way that is compatible with the constraints of natural psychology. The
standard history of liberalism takes its natural psychology to be the “tab-
ula rasa” (empty slate) theory of the human mind and its account of the
social predicament to be modern Western capitalism. Since the former
has now been scientiﬁcally discredited, and the latter seems wedded to
a very particular historical time and place, the ability of liberalism to
speak to the concerns of today’s world seems—on this view—extremely
limited. How can it even understand, let alone meet the challenge of,
other philosophies, from socialism to nationalism to Islamic fundamen-
talism? Is the only alternative what Samuel Huntington has famously and
depressingly called a “clash of civilizations”?13
Let’s look ﬁrst at how this conventional historical interpretation has
been framed. Most historical accounts would see the origins of liberalism
in capitalism (and its dependence on what the historian C. B. Macpherson
called “possessive individualism”14), in the Reformation and its uphold-
ing of the sacredness of the individual conscience, and also in shared
and horriﬁed reaction to the brutality of the religious wars that wracked
Europe in the sixteenth and, especially, the seventeenth centuries.15
According to this view, capitalism and the Reformation acted as solvents,
easing the move from status to contract, from gift to market, from magic
to science, from a world of familiars to a world of strangers. They could
do this because of a great malleability in human psychology, one noted
and celebrated by philosophers from Locke to Russell. At the same time,
modernity posed new problems for mankind that required radically new
solutions, and it was the job of the prophets of liberalism not only to
chart the arrival of modernity but actively to propose solutions to its
discontents. So writers such as Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, and John Stu-
art Mill were social reformers, drawing on the resources of liberal ideas
to put forward both speciﬁc solutions to perceived social evils and also
a framework of thought within which such solutions made sense. Their
writings, and the ferment of ideas to which they contributed, had some
momentous consequences:
• the European revolutions of 1789 and 1848;
• the anticolonial movements of the early nineteenth century in Latin
America and, albeit with a very long lag, in Africa and Asia in the
twentieth century;

Globalization and Political Action • 297
• the moves toward free trade by the major European powers, Great
Britain and Germany, in the nineteenth century;
• much more recently, the growing tension between rationalism and
pluralism, between the wish to tolerate alternative lifestyles and the
hope that everything, including lifestyle, is accessible to rational
evaluation and criticism. This is a tension that bedevils modern
multiculturalism, and that some critics of liberalism have seen as
its Achilles heel.16
It is critical to this standard history of liberalism that the predicaments
and concerns it raises are quite diﬀerent from those of the ancient world.
Benjamin Constant’s famous essay “The Liberty of the Ancients and the
Liberty of the Moderns” is perhaps the purest expression of this view,17
but in one way or another it is central to our view of liberalism as a West-
ern capitalist ideology—a view whose ﬁt with the preoccupations of non-
Western, noncapitalist societies and such ideologies as Islam remains
very uncertain. Some writers have queried the strength of the division
between ancient and modern sensibilities (the late Bernard Williams is
an important example).18 But this has not really disturbed the consensus
that sees liberalism as rooted in just one of several rival economic, polit-
ical, and cultural systems, nor the resulting anxiety about the fragility of
liberalism’s claim to oﬀer inspiration across the globe.
And yet this historical account makes no sense of the fact that human
beings have faced the challenge of living with strangers for the last ten
thousand years. The challenge of openness to those who do not share
our traditions did not begin with Columbus’s voyage to the New World.
Protestantism was not the ﬁrst challenge to the authority of insecure
priests. Capitalism was not the ﬁrst set of institutions to create mar-
ketplaces in which a cacophony of languages and kaleidoscope of dress
styles came together in pursuit of a shared interest in exchange. Peri-
cles’ defense of the openness of Athenian society may not have been
delivered at a town hall meeting in a modern liberal state, but it is a per-
fect expression of the predicament to which liberalism must respond,
and the need for a society to overcome its fear of strangers if modern
life is to be possible. This point of view may not have received its full
philosophical stamp of approval until the writings of Locke, Rousseau,
Voltaire, and Hume. But we should not see these writers as the original
inventors of solutions to the problem of cohabiting a planet with people
who are diﬀerent from us, who are our rivals, and who nevertheless also
share common interests. We should understand those writers instead as

298 • Chapter 17
codifying and expressing publicly solutions that were already implicit in
the human capacities that had enabled people for thousands of years to
deal—literally—with strangers.
Seeing liberalism as a set of ideas that are (at least implicitly) ten thou-
sand rather than merely ﬁve hundred years old has two great advan-
tages. First, we can see its proper relation to other political ideologies.
Socialism is not an alternative to liberalism’s conception of humankind’s
social predicament, but rather one proposed means of resolving that
predicament—it is a rival to some of the prescriptions of liberal writers
rather than to their diagnosis. Both socialism and classical liberalism
are compatible with a vision of humanity as needing to ﬁnd a way to live
with strangers; they simply disagree about how much individual enter-
prise and how much collective action are required for the task. Classical
liberalism has frequently been naive about what could be expected from
individual enterprise without collective action. Socialism has been naive
both about the ease of achieving collective action and about the dangers
of its being abused for militaristic or politically repressive ends.
Similarly, Islam as a political ideology consists of a set of ideas and
values that proved extremely successful at building cohesion in soci-
eties under stress at a crucial period in their history. For several cen-
turies Islamic societies led the world in culture, cosmopolitanism, and
military strength: as Bernard Lewis has put it, Islam “created a world
civilization, polyethnic, multiracial, international, one might even say
intercontinental.”19 Some Islamic centers, as in southern Spain before
the Christian reconquest and in the more cosmopolitan parts of the
Ottoman Empire, were models of tolerance and—yes—liberalism that
have rarely been equaled in any culture since. Islam had evolved a
response to the challenge of a world populated with strangers, though
one that has proved fragile under the stresses of more recent centuries.
That fragility is not accidental, though.20 The fact that Islam rapidly
acquired impressive military and political strength within a few years
of its foundation meant that—unlike Christianity—it never needed to
develop a philosophy of compromise with secular authorities and could
indulge the ambition of a comprehensive regulation of social life. Its
periods of tolerance were, therefore, the product of vast self-conﬁdence
and the absence of any real internal challenge rather than an ideology
that had adapted to the permanent presence of strangers. How Islam
will evolve in future decades remains very unclear, but whatever the
rhetoric of its more warlike adherents, whatever the attractions of all-out

Globalization and Political Action • 299
aggression against unbelievers, Islam needs to evolve a new accommoda-
tion with strangers and unbelievers if it is to survive in the modern world.
In the same spirit, the antiglobalization movement cannot be inter-
preted in the literal sense of its title: globalization is a fact of the post-
agricultural age, and it cannot be wished away. Antiglobalization has
proved a very successful slogan for intragroup solidarity, and like all
forms of solidarity based on opposition to a real or imagined external
threat, it has to evolve into a basis for cooperation between groups as
well as within them. Now that the movement has succeeded in capturing
press and media attention, its more thoughtful leaders will need more
than ever to begin that task. The ﬁnancial crisis that began in 2007 will
not make this task easier, though. The justiﬁable rage it has engendered
about the excesses of those who proﬁted from the boom and were bailed
out in the bust may give renewed life to fantasies of self-suﬃciency, abso-
lute control over the economic exchanges undertaken by others, and a
closed economic life unperturbed by strangers to our settled habits. As
has been repeatedly argued throughout this book, indulging these fan-
tasies would do nothing to tackle the underlying risks and instabilities
that are inseparable from modern economic living.
The second great advantage of appreciating the true origins of liber-
alism is that we can appreciate what is valuable in the ideas of the great
liberal philosophers without being wedded to their entirely implausible
natural psychology. Locke’s tabula rasa theory of the human mind is
not taken seriously in psychology any more, and the nature of plastic-
ity in human mental capacities is now seen as the product of ecological
requirements during our prehistory: we are good at learning the kinds of
things it was adaptive for us to learn rather than to inherit as hardwired
competencies. And Rousseau’s account of the mind of the noble savage
makes no sense from an evolutionary perspective. In one almost comi-
cally patronizing passage in his essay “On the Origins of Inequality,” he
wrote that the soul of
the savage man … which nothing disturbs, dwells only in the sensation
of its present existence, without any idea of the future, however close
that might be, and his projects, as limited as his horizons, hardly extend
to the end of the day. Such is, even today, the extent of the foresight of
a Caribbean Indian: he sells his cotton bed in the morning, and in the
evening comes weeping to buy it back, having failed to foresee that he
would need it for the next night.21

300 • Chapter 17
It is hard to see how Caribbean Indians as Rousseau describes them could
have survived for a single generation, let alone populated an entire region
of the world.
Human beings ten thousand years ago had inherited a psychology
that made them intensely suspicious of strangers and capable of sav-
age violence toward them under some circumstances, but able to beneﬁt
spectacularly from institutional arrangements that made it reasonable
to treat strangers as honorary friends. The ability to abstract, therefore,
from purely tribal loyalties and grant strangers the same freedoms as
were granted to friends, the capacity to be open to new opportunities
and choose freely among them, the willingness to communicate with
those who do not share our ways of dressing, eating, and living, and to
share a space with those who do not worship our gods—none of these
constitute a purely Western capitalist mindset, even if historically it has
been Western capitalism that has wrung the most economic mileage out
of them. Indeed, these ideas are not suﬃcient in themselves to consti-
tute a whole mental outlook of any kind, but without them none of the
major historical civilizations could have developed.
This also answers our question about how much ideas matter in pol-
itics. Ideas as abstractions make almost no diﬀerence at all, for politics
remains a very tribal activity, based on competition among would-be
leaders to ﬁnd ways of triggering our instincts for loyalty and coopera-
tion. But ideas can be embodied in habits of thought that aﬀect whom
we treat as honorary friends and in institutions in which those habits of
thought are put to work. As earlier chapters of this book have described
in detail, almost all of the institutions of modern society can be under-
stood as dedicated to an utterly unnatural division of labor between
strangers. The idea of such cooperation on its own would be powerless
without the institutions that make individuals believe in the cooperation
of others, but the institutions, in turn, could not work unless they built
on a natural disposition in human beings to cooperate within them. The
political ideas that humanity will need for its survival in the next century
are, therefore, all ideas about how to make these institutions work.
Reﬂection on this history can help us to make sense of some of the
dilemmas of present-day liberalism. How much can modern citizens of
industrial society concede to alternative cultural outlooks? As much as
is needed to trust them, comes the reply. Reason is not in tension with
pluralism, because what is needed to trust strangers is much less than
what is needed to enter fully into their cultural outlook. We may or may
not like someone else’s cultural outlook, but we do not need to make up

Globalization and Political Action • 301
our minds about it in order to share the same social space with them.
Toleration does not imply bland praise for every set of ideas that diﬀers
from our own; it simply means refusing to allow diﬀerences over ideas to
prevent us from dealing with others in a civilized way. Likewise, dislike
of someone’s culture does not imply we can aﬀord to avoid dealing with
them, nor should dealing with them be construed as a threat to our own
core values.
Such liberal sentiments may sound admirable, and the fact that they
have been in some sense a part of our species’ heritage for ten millennia
may increase our respect for their pertinence to humanity as a whole
rather than just to its prosperous and privileged minorities. But today’s
world is subjecting these sentiments to new and disturbing stresses.
How likely is it that the Great Experiment can survive the unpredictable
human energies it has unleashed?

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment?
Invisible Friends, Silent Enemies
As you are reading these words, somebody you have never met is work-
ing hard on your behalf. Almost certainly many people are working for
you—an Indian farmer driving bullocks across his land so he can plant
the cotton that will be made into the shirt you will buy sometime next
year; a Brazilian farmer harvesting the coﬀee beans for your breakfast
next month; a civil servant planning the road improvements close to that
dangerous junction you pass on your way to work; a chemist synthesiz-
ing molecules to treat the illness that you still do not realize you have.
These people do not know you, but they do not need to, even though
your life, your health, and your prosperity depend upon them. You have
every reason to be grateful for the intimate links that tie them to you.
Possibly too, at this same moment, someone you have never met is
working actively on a plan to kill you. Unless you are a well-known pub-
lic ﬁgure, you may not be the speciﬁc target of his murderous inten-
tion, which may simply be directed at causing random casualties. But in
some ways that makes the possibility more worrying, since it is harder
for you to know how to make precautions, whom to be wary of, what
to avoid. You are likely to develop instead a systematic suspicion of
strangers, which may be precisely the intention of your would-be assas-
sin. Since September 11, 2001, American society in particular has seen
suspicion of strangers—especially strangers of Middle Eastern appear-
ance and Islamic faith—intensify to a remarkable degree.
Perhaps surprisingly, these risks are much less likely to aﬀect you
directly than are the many unintentional interactions between you and
millions of other strangers across the world who are not working con-
sciously to do you either good or harm. The most important immedi-
ate risk is infectious disease. Throughout history, infectious disease has
been a far greater threat than violence, and in spite of antibiotics and
modern medicine, this remains overwhelmingly true today. According to

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment? • 303
the World Health Organization, roughly 57 million deaths were recorded
worldwide in 2002—a reasonably typical year. Of these, nearly 11 mil-
lion were due to infectious or parasitic disease. That’s just under 20
per cent.1 War and violence killed around three-quarters of a million
people—a little over 1 per cent. Even in periods of major conﬂict, war
has rarely rivaled disease as a killer: the inﬂuenza pandemic of 1918 may
have killed over 50 million people worldwide, far more than had died in
the four previous horrifying years of war. As we saw in chapter 3, for all
that television brings us face to face with violence across the world, the
average risk of violence faced by the world’s citizens is almost certainly
as low now as it has ever been in our history.2
Besides cultivating and transmitting infectious diseases, strangers
across the world are also consuming scarce resources, polluting rivers
and the atmosphere, deforesting hillsides, congesting cities and scarce
agricultural land, running down or poisoning aquifers, strewing the
countryside with plastics and depleting energy reserves. They are not
paying the full cost of this wanton damage today, leaving you and oth-
ers to pay some of the cost tomorrow, or next year, or even decades from
now. It makes no sense to resent them for behaving like this, for you are
almost certainly doing many of these things yourself, or paying other
people to do so. But when faced with this alarming catalogue of damage
being done to you by strangers, you might be tempted to think that the
risks of violence are comparatively small. Homo sapiens sapiens, the shy,
murderous ape, may be spreading pestilence and pollution on a global
scale, but his violent instincts at least seem to have been triumphantly
tamed.
In the long run that may be small consolation. For if some people can
do us much good without wishing us well, many others can do us terri-
ble harm without wishing us ill. There remains much uncertainty about
precisely how much of the global warming that has occurred in recent
decades is the result of carbon dioxide emissions caused by human activ-
ity, and about the likely consequences if that activity continues along its
present course. But current best guesses suggest that climate change
is likely to make the existing pressures on resources like water very
much worse in the coming decades.3 More seriously even, many of the
stresses caused by disease and by environmental degradation may them-
selves come to provoke violent conﬂict. There are two main ways this is
likely to happen. First, through the general disruption caused to people’s
livelihoods by degraded environments and dwindling natural resources,
the resulting frustration of such people, and their disillusionment with

304 • Chapter 18
peaceful routes to prosperity. Secondly, through ethnic tensions set up
when groups migrate to escape the pressure of environmental scarcity.4
In turn these conﬂicts may disrupt the institutions that might otherwise
be able to manage environmental resources in a reasonably eﬃcient and
sustainable way—no one can expect wise or farsighted policies for water
conservation to emerge from a society in civil war. For instance, conﬂicts
over access to water have seriously worsened relations between Israelis
and Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. About 40 per cent of Israel’s
groundwater use depends on aquifers that lie principally under the West
Bank,5 and it is mournfully clear that the current state of tension leaves
little chance of reaching a fair and eﬃcient agreement on the conserva-
tion and sharing of water in the future.
At the same time, technology is aﬀecting the likelihood of future vio-
lence in two main ways. First of all, the worldwide reach of technologies
of communication—television and the internet, those two great weapons
of mass distraction—has given those who use violence in the struggle for
scarce resources a vast audience for their campaigns, as well as much
better information about the most vulnerable targets. Such technologies
do not just change the stakes for those whose use of violence is strictly
prudent and instrumental; they also provide a temptingly dramatic stage,
and a seductively compelling narrative, for those prepared to risk death
for violent ends. Modern society has, in part, turned humanity’s violent
tendencies inward, so that, as we saw in chapter 3, more people today
are killed by their own hand than by the hand of others: nearly a million
people in the world commit suicide every year. The overwhelming major-
ity are people who do so in a state of depression, friendless and alone.
Fortunately, perhaps, the crippling eﬀects of depression on the capacity
for foresight and planning mean that few such people will ever be able
to put their decision to kill themselves to a precise military or political
end. But not all who commit suicide are depressed; some are clinically
schizophrenic, while others without the beneﬁt of a formal diagnosis
appear to believe that the reward for their actions will be glory, whether
in a real heaven or in the virtual heaven of the websites and the cable
networks. As modern communications penetrate around the world, we
should not be surprised if growing numbers of the deluded, allied per-
haps to a minority of the desperate, succumb to the allure of a spectac-
ular exit before the world’s television cameras.
Secondly, the progress of military technology—if “progress” is the
appropriate word at this point—means that those inclined toward vio-
lence have increasingly destructive ways of inﬂicting it upon their

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment? • 305
victims. Some of the people who once used ﬁsts can now use knives;
some of those who once used knives can now use guns; some of those
who once used guns can now use bombs. Admittedly, some of the threats
of high-tech terrorism seem overrated. It’s unlikely, for instance, that
biological terrorism will cause even a tiny fraction of the deaths that
occur routinely from infectious diseases invented by nature, without
any malign intent, through random experimentation in her own mil-
lions of laboratories—though the fear generated by biological terrorism
is likely to be out of proportion to any casualties it will cause. Less clear is
whether nuclear weapons are likely to ﬁnd their way into the hands of ter-
rorists able and willing to deliver them to the cities of the industrialized
world. They represent a tempting source of hard currency and inﬂuence
for those states that own them, and it would be foolish to bet against
their being long held in secure custody. But high technology may be a
lesser threat than the steady, unspectacular spread around the world of
familiar, standard-issue weaponry that will allow much greater compass
to any single act of rage, aggression, or revenge. A world in which any
person’s act of rage could destroy or terrorize an entire apartment block,
street, or neighborhood would be unable to sustain the close proximity
to strangers that is at the heart of modern life. And even if in practice
such acts of rage were rare, and a balance of terror prevailed in each
street, a world in which every citizen could resist the demands of the
police, the law courts, and the tax authorities with weaponry that was a
match for the state’s own would be a world in which civic institutions as
we know them could no longer function.
Perhaps, then, the character that has principally deﬁned states for
the last few centuries—namely, their monopoly of coercion within a sta-
ble territory—may now be coming under serious challenge. This might
seem no more than the logical evolution of modern society—monopo-
lies are coming under challenge from smaller and nimbler competitors
everywhere, from telecommunications to steel markets to the domains
of information and ideas—but it would have more disturbing conse-
quences. An easier, more competitive supply of weapons imposes more
dangerous externalities on others than an easier, more competitive sup-
ply of telecoms or steel. It would also limit the ability of the state to func-
tion as the counterweight to market exchange through its powers to raise
taxes and regulate the operation of markets. Not everyone would regret
this limitation. But the infrastructure of modern society, which we think
we can aﬀord to disdain because it is so familiar that we are scarcely

306 • Chapter 18
aware of its existence, would crumble without the coercive potential of
the modern state.
Whether the Great Experiment survives much past its ﬁrst ten thou-
sand years will depend, therefore, on the answers to three main ques-
tions:
• First, can states survive as monopolies of coercion within their own
territorial frontiers?
• Second, can they combine the openness and ﬂexibility needed by
modern industrial societies with the trust in strangers that has
been so laboriously established over previous centuries?
• Third, can they ﬁnd ways to create between themselves an analo-
gous version of the trust in strangers that they seek to create among
their citizens?
The ﬁrst question amounts to asking whether the state can protect peo-
ple from external threats better than any other institution. The second
amounts to asking whether states can protect their own citizens from
each other. The third amounts to asking whether states can protect them-
selves from each other conﬁdently enough to cooperate rather than live
in fear.
The Survival of the State
All monopolies depend for their survival as monopolies either on some
technological advantage over their competitors or on the inherited priv-
ileges derived from a special relationship with the state. The state itself
cannot rely on such inherited privileges, of course. So its survival will
depend on whether it continues to enjoy intrinsic organizational advan-
tages over other institutions that can exercise coercion, such as ter-
rorist organizations, religious orders, or even just isolationist citizens
with heavy weaponry in their back yards. Surprisingly, perhaps (in an
age when new technologies are transforming organizations in so many
domains of life), the continued organizational superiority of the nation-
state looks rather likely for the foreseeable future.
Why? Developing eﬀective military technology still requires control
over territory. A terrorist group operating in a network of cells can make
simple bombs or develop chemical or biological weapons, but these are
undiscriminating devices that cannot be used in self-defense or as a way
to pursue systematic bargaining for political ends. Such a group can-
not deliver massive destructive power to a precise target some distance

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment? • 307
away—the necessary condition for credible military bargaining with a
powerfully armed nation-state—unless it controls territory of its own.
Even owning pirated stocks of weapons-grade uranium is useless to an
organization unless it can develop this into a weapon undisturbed, hide
the weapon from preemptive attack, and then deliver it to its target. All
this requires the organization to have undisputed control over a signif-
icant area of land. But to control territory it is not enough to be rich or
to have superior technological skills. The organization also needs peo-
ple, to patrol its borders, to manage its internal structure and activi-
ties, to protect it from subversion. These people need somewhere to
live, and they need the infrastructure of life—schools, hospitals, leisure
activities—which the organization must either rely on the state to pro-
vide or must provide for itself. Any organization that can provide these
things for itself is already operating on a scale of ambition and internal
coercion to make it, in all essentials, a state, and states will never be
viable in a hostile environment unless they have signiﬁcant populations
(statelets such as Monaco or Liechtenstein survive because they are not
in hostile environments). In short, defense needs a good deal of terri-
tory; managing territory needs a good many people; so in defense there
remains a real advantage to being large. Just how large a viable state has
to be is an open question, and the thresholds of viable size may be falling
in the modern world (just as they have risen and fallen at various stages
in history).6 These thresholds are also open to bloody and protracted
negotiation, with periods of stalemate in which zones can be occupied
by guerrilla organizations able to resist the demands of central govern-
ment but unable to create a properly functioning state of their own, as in
the areas of Sri Lanka that were once occupied by the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam or those of Colombia still occupied by the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia.7 But it is unlikely that the thresholds of via-
bility have fallen so far as to create any credible alternative to something
very like the state as we know it today.
The Survival of Trust within Nation-States
Even so, can nation-states continue to assure our trust in strangers? As
Raymond Chandler pointed out, it can be easier to rule a country than a
city. A future is imaginable in which nation-states can patrol their bor-
ders against invasions but are powerless to stop inﬁltrations; in which
people are safe from foreign armies but live in terror of their neigh-
bors; in which a trip to the grocery store becomes a hazardous and

308 • Chapter 18
adrenaline-fueled venture, as the hunt must once have been for our Pale-
olithic ancestors.
One of the strengths of our trust-building institutions, as they were
described in the early chapters of this book, is how decentralized they
are. We ourselves are the real police; those who wear uniforms are just
the special forces, playing a crucial but minority role in overseeing the
billions of daily interactions between strangers in our modern world.
The barriers to violent or opportunistic behavior consist mostly in habits
learned early in life and performed almost unthinkingly before an audi-
ence of other people rather like ourselves. While this makes them prone
to frequent, small disruptions—the stuﬀof countless human-interest
stories in local newspapers and television reports—large disruptions are
rare. Even a ﬁnancial crisis as grave as the one that erupted in 2007
leaves most of the day-to-day interactions of modern life intact—by long-
run historical standards ﬁnancial crises are minor disruptions, for all
that they may bring countless individual tragedies in their wake. This is
because the system has no real command center and therefore no sin-
gle point of vulnerability. To disrupt the trust-building institutions of
modern society requires subjecting many of them to frontal assault, as
in wartime. Some terrorist organizations aim to do almost this, to repro-
duce through precision assaults on visible and symbolically charged tar-
gets the sense of vulnerability characteristic of a society at war. To the
extent that they can succeed, this will be because even a decentralized
system has certain symbolic centers, damage to which harms our will-
ingness to trust our fellow citizens.8 It will not be because any individual
target (even, say, a capital city) is in itself critical to the functioning of
our institutions of trust.
Researchers have devoted much eﬀort in recent years to studying the
properties that make networks (like computer, power, or transportation
networks) robust against disruption.9 They have stressed the importance
of an architecture that allows some links within a network to do the job
of others that may be damaged through accident or design. Some net-
works function eﬃciently under normal conditions through an architec-
ture built around hubs that connect many diﬀerent links. Major airports,
for instance, allow even complex journeys through an air transportation
network to be made with only one or two interconnections: by ﬂying
through Chicago, you can get to many destinations with just one stop. If
there are too few such hubs, the network can break down dramatically
when one of them fails. The more hubs there are, the more robust is the

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment? • 309
network against disruption (you can reroute through another hub). But
the cost is redundancy—building more links than you normally need.
Occasional malevolent assaults on the hubs of our society are likely
to happen for the foreseeable future. Technology and the global spread
of weapons may make some of these assaults spectacularly deadly. And
to the extent that we are connected to others as never before in our
history, we all face such threats from a greater variety of directions. But
such assaults have always been a hazard of human life, and in many ways
modern society has fewer irreplaceable hubs than in the past. Medieval
European societies had monarchs who embodied authority and legiti-
macy in their own person and whose assassination could provoke mas-
sive bloodletting. Most modern societies invest authority and legitimacy
in presidents or equivalent oﬃceholders who can be replaced by vice
presidents at a moment’s notice without major social breakdown. These
transitions are not always smooth: charismatic individual leaders may
seem irreplaceable, and others may choose to try and make themselves
so by deliberate practice of personalized politics. (When Indian prime
minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated in 1984 by a Sikh member of
her own bodyguard, thousands of people were killed in ethnic violence
between Hindus and Sikhs.) But modern society is nevertheless founded
on the shared presumption that individuals count for less in their con-
tribution to social trust than do the roles they play. If this were not so,
we would need to learn far too much about too many individuals to be
able to trust any of them.
This is true of political oﬃceholders, and it is also true at the humble
level of individual interaction. In a smoothly functioning modern society,
you can trust me to transact reasonably with you not because of my
character and personality (about which you know little and care less),
nor because you share my religion or my politics (which may repel you),
nor because you know my family, but simply because of the social space
we share. If it is to survive future challenges, such a social space needs
construction through institutions (including systems of education) that
are blind to all the particularities of individuals except those that are
strictly necessary for their interaction. In a word, it requires a degree
of impartiality. Members of any one tribe, religion, family, nationality,
or ethnic group need to be sure that when they encounter strangers, it
is safe to deal with them. It is in this sense that education needs to be
secular, multiethnic, liberal, a challenge that education systems in many
countries have yet properly to face.

310 • Chapter 18
Indeed, the secular character of education has been coming under
increasing assault in some countries that wish to see schools reclaimed
as the preserve of communitarian and religious values. Whatever the
merits of transmitting particular sets of communitarian and religious
values to one’s children, schools in the twenty-ﬁrst century need above
all to teach children the one vital skill for the survival of humanity,
namely, how to live peacefully and proﬁtably with people whose commu-
nity and religion are not one’s own. Awareness of religion and ethnicity
need not be banished from the schoolroom, but the schoolroom must be
a place where ethnic groups learn how to meet and mingle rather than
to ﬁght.
Concretely, to take an example that has been much discussed in
France, where I live, a law passed in 2004 forbids the wearing of “con-
spicuous” marks of religious identity in public schools. There are some
obvious problems with such a law. Public discussion has focused on the
ethnic discrimination implicit in the “conspicuousness” provision—it is
much easier for cruciﬁxes, for instance, to be deemed adequately dis-
creet than are most of the marks of Islam. There have also been concerns
that the law may be encouraging religious parents to withdraw their chil-
dren from public schools, which would evidently be counter-productive
from the point of view of promoters of ethnic integration. What has not
been said enough is that the purpose of a secular education should not
be to pretend that religious diﬀerences do not exist, but rather to give
people training in living with them. This requires creating for everyone a
secure environment in which these diﬀerences are no barrier to peaceful
and productive interaction. Such an environment seems hardly threat-
ened by the Islamic headscarf. The same cannot be said of the burqa,
which is a barrier to the facial recognition that underlies human inter-
action and that we use to signal our willingness to treat strangers as
honorary friends. But this is not a problem in schools and is no more
than a marginal phenomenon in France as a whole. In 2009 fewer than
400 women in France wear the burqa, according to the French news-
paper Libération,10 so it hardly seems likely to undermine the secular
state. There is, to be sure, much controversy about such issues, about
how much of our ethnic identity we can legitimately take with us into
public spaces, and about how likely it is that secular systems of edu-
cation can be made to work. But that we need them to work somehow
is an almost inescapable implication of the irreversible intermingling of
strangers in the modern world: it is too late now to unmix the eggs from
the omelette and put them back into their shells.

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment? • 311
It would be naive to think that a system of trust-building institutions
that is decentralized enough to be robust against disruption will always
be impartial enough to inspire the conﬁdence of strangers. Indeed, it is
a mark of decentralized institutions that those who wish to use them
for partial and communitarian ends can always try to do so. We can be
sure that some countries will live through periods of ethnic violence and
suspicion, which will discredit their institutions, doing damage that may
take years or decades to repair. This is a particular danger in countries
located in fragile environments who may face the disappearance of the
resource base on which they depend for whatever prosperity they have
enjoyed in the past. If global temperatures rise dramatically in coming
decades, substantial parts of Africa may become uninhabitable, and the
diﬃculties of integrating their populations into other more hospitable
areas of the globe are likely to provoke ethnic conﬂicts on a large scale. It
is hard to know how probable are catastrophic breakdowns of the order
of modern societies. But what is certain is that no country can hope to live
peacefully and prosperously unless it ﬁnds ways to reconcile its citizens
to mutual trust. And even that is only part of the task. Countries that
have resolved their internal challenges still have to learn how to trust
each other.
Trust between Nation-States
The last decade of the twentieth century saw the political and economic
collapse of one of the two superpowers that had sustained the Cold War,
the spread of democratic institutions to many countries that had not
previously enjoyed them (particularly in central and eastern Europe),
the creation of many new institutions of cooperation between nation-
states (from the International Criminal Court to the World Trade Orga-
nization), the signing of international treaties on such matters as the
control of global warming, and a highly visible and activist role for the
United Nations. If trust between nations could be measured by the pro-
liferation of agreements, the future would surely be bright.
Yet, as is well-known, the ﬁrst years of the twenty-ﬁrst century disap-
pointed the optimists in very many ways. That the United States at the
turn of the century had become militarily predominant over the whole
world to a degree unprecedented in history and paralleled in any part of
the world only by the hegemony of the Roman empire two millennia ago
made it paradoxically harder for the United States to achieve its own
ends. Trust grows more naturally between two wolves than between a

312 • Chapter 18
wolf and a sheep, and no amount of sincere protestation addressed from
wolf to sheep can alter this melancholy fact. Of course, if the United
States were able to function reasonably wisely in the world without the
trust of other countries, this might not matter very much. The U.S.-led
invasion of Iraq in 2003 suggested that this was an inﬂuential American
view, or at least one on which the Bush administration was prepared to
lay a large bet. Not only did many Americans believe that the coopera-
tion of other countries mattered little; they also seemed to believe that
the United States would police the world with prudence and wisdom for
the foreseeable future.
This has revealed itself to be a dangerous mistake. The United States
will need the full and enthusiastic cooperation of other countries if its
prosperity and liberties are to be preserved. This is not just a matter of
American dependence on foreign energy reserves and other imported
goods, and on the mobility of American goods and ideas around the
world. It is also a matter of the need for other countries, in particular the
emerging superpowers China and India, to cooperate in solving problems
where externalities matter on a world scale, notably in the protection of
the environment. American military predominance will not on its own
persuade China and India to cooperate in controlling global warming;
it may even make cooperation more diﬃcult. Most of all, if individual
Americans are to be physically present in the rest of the world, they
will need physical protection there, whether they come as guests or as
policemen. Even policemen need to move comfortably among strangers,
and even policemen rely on a largely voluntary cooperation, most of the
time, from the societies in which they move. And yet, in the old paradox
described by Hegel, the more powerful the policeman, the harder it is
for him to command the free assent on which the creative exercise of
his power depends.
As the Iraq war also showed, the military predominance of the United
States can act against its own interests in a second way, because purely
domestic political checks are not strong enough to prevent that predom-
inance from being exercised in reckless and self-defeating ways. The
knowledge that military aggression carries a high risk of casualties is
the best restraint against the exercise of that aggression. This is true
(as we have seen) for groups of marauding chimpanzees, and it is no
less true for us, their biological relatives. Without such risks, aggressive
wars, fought for plausible but ultimately foolish reasons, are eventu-
ally inevitable. Relying on moral restraint is not enough, for as we have
also seen warfare draws upon and inspires genuinely impressive feats

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment? • 313
of altruism—even when the warfare is aggressive and imprudent. Even
aggressive wars are fought with a moral fervor. Nor are purely political
checks enough. Decisions about acts of war typically rely on intelligence
information that is impossible for citizens to verify, as was demonstrated
by the debate in the United States and the United Kingdom over whether
Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. This means that political
leaders rely on appeals to the trust of citizens, who are in a weak posi-
tion to determine whether that trust has been justiﬁed in any particular
case.
In one respect, though, the asymmetry between the United States and
its rivals provides a reason for optimism. Nearly four decades ago, the
economist Mancur Olson analyzed, in The Logic of Collective Action, the
incentives for members of a group to contribute to public goods. These
are goods that beneﬁt the entire group and from which no members can
be excluded if they fail to contribute. The incentive of members to free-
ride on the contributions of others is well-known—we saw it at work in
chapter 16. But Olson also drew attention to what might happen if there
was signiﬁcant inequality between group members. Members who were
economically powerful, gaining a signiﬁcant share of the beneﬁts from
public goods, would tend to make large contributions, thereby further
diminishing the already low willingness of weaker members to make
any contribution at all. As Olson put it, somewhat provocatively, “there
is a systematic tendency for ‘exploitation’ of the great by the small.”11
Powerful members might wish they could persuade others to contribute
more, but their own need for the public good makes them contribute
enough to satisfy the weaker members’ inclination to pay.
The political leaders of the United States would no doubt recognize
Olson’s description of their plight, and the phrase “the exploitation of the
great by the small” would perhaps strike a responsive chord. They might
consider his analysis to apply mainly to areas where the United States
already intervenes in the world and seeks to share the cost (as in the mili-
tary interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan). But it has lessons equally for
areas where the United States has been reluctant to pursue cooperative
action, perhaps thinking itself insulated from the consequences of inac-
tion. Events in the ﬁrst decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century have begun to
persuade American leaders and citizens that they are less insulated than
they once believed. Olson’s logic may persuade them that they need to
contribute to the building of international stability even without waiting
for the contributions of other nations.

314 • Chapter 18
The implication of these arguments is that, paradoxically, the United
States itself has a strong interest in international institutions that con-
strain its power and discretion. This is a version, projected onto an inter-
national scale, of a fundamental argument that has appeared repeatedly
in this book. When modern man goes out into a city to mingle with
strangers, he is bound by a multitude of constraints that prevent him
from asserting his Paleolithic personality. When a stranger oﬀers him
food, he cannot simply seize it as his prize but must meekly sign a
credit-card slip. When the credit card company asks for settlement of
his account, he cannot proudly tell them to go hang but must pay up,
or face endless petty nuisances that—most of the time—are a credible
incentive to comply. When another stranger picks his pocket, he must
report the theft patiently to the police rather than seeking out the per-
petrator and killing him along with all his tribe. In short, bourgeois pru-
dence has driven out panache, and modern society is unimaginable in
any other way. The stronger and more unchallenged is any one individ-
ual, the more he needs these petty and unexciting constraints. Without
them, he will ﬁnd the marketplace empty, and the few strangers he ever
meets will be cowed and fearful, plotting revenge behind his back for the
humiliations he imposes on them to their face.
This has implications too for the motives to which the strong can real-
istically appeal in seeking the cooperation of the weak, for the weak can
aﬀord panache even less than the strong. Successful coalitions to tackle
some of the world’s most serious problems—such as anticipating and
adapting to large-scale climate change—can only be built on an appeal
to the interests of all. As we saw in chapter 4, ideals such as reciprocity
and a sense of fairness can help to cement trust, but they cannot cre-
ate trust from nothing if no foundation of shared interests exists. Much
public discussion of global warming has represented the problem as one
of fairness to our distant descendants (the Stern Review of 2006 is the
most eminent example, seeking to persuade its readers on philosoph-
ical grounds of the importance of taking into account the interests of
generations a long distance into the future12). Unfortunately, it will be
hard to persuade the poorer citizens of India and China that they must
make sacriﬁces today for very distant descendants the great majority of
whom will be far richer than they themselves are. If instead the prob-
lem is presented as one that, within the lifetime of children alive today,
threatens to provoke a breakdown of social trust due to movements of
populations whose resource base has collapsed, a breakdown that will

Conclusion: How Fragile Is the Great Experiment? • 315
hurt poor countries as badly as rich ones, there is a more realistic chance
of building the coalitions without which all hope of progress is futile.
If the Great Experiment is to survive an era of globalization, environ-
mental degradation, and arms proliferation, international relations will
need the weak to see the advantages of participation, and the strong
will need to see the point of granting them such advantages. For all that
international diplomacy resounds to high-minded declarations, it is all
about compromises and cutting deals; the activities of the marketplace
of nations. But the leaders of the rich world have still to be convinced
that the marketplace of nations needs trust-building institutions as pro-
foundly as do the ordinary market-places of the modern world. It is a
mark of the wound suﬀered by the United States on September 11, 2001
that a country that has mastered better than any other the transforma-
tion of the frontier spirit into the bourgeois virtues should have become,
in the aftermath of that tragedy, so impatient with the demands of bour-
geois prudence in its dealings with the rest of the world.
It’s time to sum up. Contrary to what one might conclude from the
excitable tone of much recent press comment, globalization and its chal-
lenges are not new but a continuation of social developments of at least
the last ten thousand years. The conceptual habits we need to deal with
these challenges are not new either, and the fact that they have been
more explicitly articulated in the last three centuries perhaps indicates
that they are so instinctive and familiar that it has often been easy to
overlook them. But their being instinctive and familiar does not pre-
vent them being fragile. On the contrary, the practical intelligence that
has evolved among human beings is one that is skilled at manipulating
the natural environment, and also at managing the interactions of small
groups of individuals who see each other frequently and know each other
well. It is only in the last ten thousand years that human beings have had
to come to terms on a signiﬁcant scale with the impact of strangers, and
it is only in the last two hundred or so that this impact has become a
dominant fact of everyday life. To manage the hazards imposed on us
by the actions of strangers has required us to deploy a diﬀerent skill
bequeathed to us by evolution for quite diﬀerent purposes, the capac-
ity for abstract symbolic thought. Modern political institutions temper
their appeals to the deep emotions, to family and clan loyalty, with just
enough abstract reasoning to help Homo sapiens sapiens, the shy, mur-
derous ape, emerge from his family bands in the savanna woodland in
order to live and work in a world largely populated by strangers. This
experiment is still young, and needs all the help it can get.

mechanisms.
9. When biologists speak of individuals “sharing” genes, they are referring
to those genes that vary across members of the same species. The great major-
ity of human genes are common to the whole species; indeed, most are shared
with other primates. For the theory of kin selection, what matters is the proba-
bility that two individuals share a mutation that ﬁrst appeared in the genome of
their most recent common ancestor. This probability is given by the proportion
of genes that have been inherited from their most recent common ancestor,
instead of from other ancestors—even if the ones inherited from other ances-
tors are, at most loci, identical.

10. Recent DNA evidence for chimpanzees suggests that the degree of relat-
edness of male chimpanzees in a typical group may be less close than had pre-
viously been thought (see Lukas et al. 2005). In particular, relatedness of males
(who typically remain in the group on becoming adult) may be little greater
than that of females (who come into the group from outside as adolescents).
This evidence needs to be conﬁrmed more widely, but if correct would imply
that explanations for chimp cooperation based on kin selection would need
supplementing by other mechanisms.

spread of advantageous traits would have been through a population dispersed
across the globe.
16. The evolution of human consciousness is brilliantly discussed in Mithen
(1996); early development of these ideas was by Humphrey (1984). Klein & Edgar
(2002) and Klein (2009) give clear accounts of the main questions and uncertain-
ties surrounding the evolution of symbolic capacity in man; for a view placing
the key developments later, see Renfrew (2007). Deacon (1997) is a compre-
hensive account of the challenges facing an evolutionary account of symbolic
ability. Tomasello (1999) links human cultural capacities to an evolved ability to
put ourselves in the position of the psychological responses of others. This abil-
ity was adaptive because it improved our powers to predict and it had dramatic
consequences for the cumulative nature of our culture because it enormously
increased our ability to imitate the behavior of those others. These arguments
are discussed in more detail in chapter 14.
17. The last common ancestor through the maternal line of all human beings
alive today lived around 140,000 years ago (see Cavalli-Sforza 2000, pp. 77–
82; Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 2003). The last common ancestor through the
paternal line lived more recently, perhaps 50,000 years ago (see Thomson et
al. 2000); this reﬂects the fact that the most reproductively successful males
can have more children than the most reproductively successful females, so
their genes spread faster through the population. The last common ancestor
whose inheritance passed through both lines very probably lived much more
recently, possibly even as recently as 2,000–5,000 years ago (Rohde et al. 2004).
However, because of genetic recombination the probability that any mutation in
that individual would have been transmitted to all living descendants is vanish-
ingly small. Suﬃciently adaptive mutations in such an individual might establish
themselves in a large proportion of living descendants within one or two thou-
sand years, especially if such an individual lived in a place that was a center of
commerce and migration (see also Cochrane & Harpending 2009). This explains

Notes to Chapter 1 • 319
the widespread prevalence of certain alleles such as those coding for malarial
resistance or lactose tolerance in adults. But it seems unlikely that those cod-
ing for whatever changes enabled human symbolic capacity were of such recent
origin given their widespread prevalence.
18. The puzzle of multiple discoveries of agriculture is discussed in Richer-
son et al. (2001). See also the prologue to part IV.
19. Blackmore (1999) emphasizes that we cannot conclude that the evolution
of human institutions (which are one form of the behavior patterns she calls,
following Dawkins (1976), “memes”) is beneﬁcial for human beings, or even for
their genes. She argues that “what makes us diﬀerent [from other animals] is our
ability to imitate” and stresses that once behavior patterns are imitated, “some-
thing is passed on. This ‘something’ can then be passed on again, and again,
and so take on a life of its own.” Memes evolve, in other words, for the good
of the memes and not for the good of anyone or anything else. Nevertheless,
we can investigate whether human psychology, as shaped by natural selection,
makes it easier for certain memes to spread than for others; the extent to which
meme evolution is thus constrained by psychology is an empirical question.

21. This is well expressed in Cowen (2009).
22. See Cosmides & Tooby (1992) and other contributions to the same vol-
ume. Buss (2008) is a textbook treatment. Buller (2005) challenges the main
claims of evolutionary psychology on a number of grounds, including its neglect
of the diversity of psychological traits in human populations and of the extent
to which even apparently uniform and stable adult traits may be learned rather
than inherited. The arguments developed in this book are not subject to the
criticisms leveled by Buller, as I discuss in more detail in part II.
Chapter 1. Who’s in Charge?
1. The startling character of cooperative exchange involved in the production
of even simple objects is not a new observation; see, for example, the discus-
sion of pencils in Friedman & Friedman (1990, pp. 11–13). In 2009 an artist
named Thomas Thwaites decided to try producing a toaster “from scratch—
beginning by mining the raw materials and ending with a product that Argos
sells for £3.99.” See www.thetoasterproject.org (accessed October 22, 2009)—
interestingly, the way the artist found to smelt the iron ore into steel was to
use a microwave, so this was hardly an example of economic self-suﬃciency.
Stephen Dubner has drawn attention to the following passage in the Babylonian
Talmud (Tractate Berachot 58a) that predates Adam Smith’s famous tale of the
Babylonian pin factory by some 1,500 years:
Ben Zoma once saw a crowd on one of the steps of the Temple Mount.
He said, Blessed is He that discerneth secrets, and blessed is He who
has created all these to serve me. [For] he used to say: What labours
Adam had to carry out before he obtained bread to eat! He ploughed,
he sowed, he reaped, he bound [the sheaves], he threshed and win-
nowed and selected the ears, he ground [them], and sifted [the ﬂour],

320 • Notes to Prologue to Part II
he kneaded and baked, and then at last he ate; whereas I get up, and
ﬁnd all these things done for me.
And how many labours Adam had to carry out before he obtained a
garment to wear! He had to shear, wash [the wool], comb it, spin it, and
weave it, and then at last he obtained a garment to wear; whereas I get
up and ﬁnd all these things done for me. All kinds of craftsmen come
early to the door of my house, and I rise in the morning and ﬁnd all
these before me.

kinds of work and documents its links to income and education levels. He

4. Hacking (1990) is a fascinating account of the rise of statistics as a disci-
pline and the wonder provoked in its practitioners by the apparent regularity
of human behavior in large numbers.
5. The proportion of jobs in rich countries lost through international compe-
tition is by most estimates smaller than the proportion lost through technical
change. See Bourguignon et al. (2002) for a summary of these issues. Neverthe-
less, the spectacular recent growth of China and India, as well as the growing
importance of service jobs outsourced compared to manufacturing jobs, makes
the potential structural eﬀects of international competition somewhat larger
than they appeared at the time of the ﬁrst edition. See Coe (2008).

2. Though not quite indistinguishable: human brain size has fallen since
around ﬁfty thousand years ago, and some of this fall may have taken place
in the last twelve thousand years. One theory (see Wrangham 2003; Cochrane &
Harpending 2009) suggests this may have been due to a process like the domes-
tication of animals, in which particularly violent or antisocial individuals had
their breeding possibilities reduced through ostracism. Domesticated animals
typically have brains smaller than their wild relatives. It is too early yet to say
whether this theory will prove persuasive, but we can be conﬁdent that it will
not remove the need to explain how human institutions have managed to tame
the violence of which our species is still capable.

Notes to Chapter 2 • 321
Chapter 2. Man and the Risks of Nature
1. In the ﬁrst edition I phrased the second point slightly diﬀerently, as “grand-
children have been, again on average, very slightly more intelligent than their
grandparents.” However, Professor Kimmo Eriksson of Mälardalen University
in Sweden has kindly pointed out that this is not strictly true. As he explains,
“since intelligence has de facto increased, the positive eﬀect of natural selection
must more than cancel the negative average eﬀect of mutations. However, from
grandparents to grandchildren there are two rounds of mutation and only one
round of natural selection, so the negative eﬀect will probably still dominate”
(personal communication). This explains the sadly less elegant formulation to
which I have resorted for this edition. I am grateful to Professor Eriksson for
this clariﬁcation.
2. Suppose that of a population of 200 million, 20 million have a certain con-
dition. Then a test with 99 per cent reliability, applied to the whole population,
will generate 19.8 million true positives and 1.8 million false positives. This
means that if you test positive, you have a probability of just over 90 per cent
of having the condition. If the condition is much rarer, aﬀecting only 20,000 in
the population, then the test will generate 19,800 true positives and 1.98 mil-
lion false positives. This means that even if you test positive, the probability
you have the condition is still only a little over 1 per cent, namely, 19,800 as a
proportion of 1.98 million plus 19,800. This idea is embodied in the statistical
theorem known as Bayes Law.

drivers drive more closely to cyclists who wear safety helmets. However, Sen
& Mizzen (2007) have provided some reasons to be skeptical about the size of
the eﬀects measured in other studies. They point out that sometimes seat-belt
use or the purchase of cars with airbags may be prompted by drivers’ recogni-
tion of preexisting dangers, so the measured association may mean that high
risk causes the adoption of safety measures, rather than vice versa. Overall, it
seems reasonable to expect that there is some oﬀsetting eﬀect of riskier behav-
ior when protective equipment is used, though not enough to neutralize entirely
the protective eﬀect of the equipment.

Chapter 3. Our Violent Past
1. Dostoyevsky 1865.
2. For the evidence that men are, on average, more violent than women, see
Daly & Wilson (1988), Wrangham & Peterson (1996), Barash & Lipton (2002), and
Ghiglieri (1999); Barash (2002) provides a summary. Needless to say, all such
comparisons are based on averages of behavior patterns in the populations in
question and do not imply biological determinism in any individual case.
3. So, of course, does killing a related member of the same sex and species,
but the rivalry is less intense because of the shared genes.
4. Act 4, scene 3.
5. Evidence from a preindustrial society (speciﬁcally, the Yanomamo of
Venezuela) that men who kill others have more children is found in Chagnon
(1988), though it is also a plausible inference from other ethnographic studies,
such as Meggitt (1977). Robarchek & Robarchek (1997, p. 133) cite data that
appear to support this inference, though they themselves have doubts about its
validity.
6. Andersson (1994) discusses the theory of sexual selection at length. It is
discussed speciﬁcally in relation to violence in Ghiglieri (1999). Sexual selection
was central to Charles Darwin’s vision of human society, as I discuss in Seabright
(2009b) and as documented by Desmond & Moore (2009). The role of sexual
selection in generating conﬂict, both between the sexes and among members of
the same sex, has generated a good deal of recent research, summarized in Arn-
qvist & Rowe (2005). This research has been criticized by Roughgarden (2004,
2009). Her criticism wrongly interprets the notion of sexual conﬂict as implying
that the interests of the sexes are opposed; in fact, they have many interests
in common and only some that diverge. Nevertheless, she provides much fasci-
nating empirical material showing how varied are the traits that have evolved
under sexual selection—a point, incidentally, with which I believe Darwin would
have been in much fuller agreement than she concedes.
7. Evidence about infanticide in primates is set out in De Waal (2001, espe-
cially at pp. 27, 30, 60–61, and 88–89). It is also discussed, in relation to primate
and human violence more generally, in Ghiglieri (1999, especially pp. 129–33),
though Ghiglieri overlooks the evidence that bonobos are strikingly less vio-
lent than chimpanzees. Diamond (1993, pp. 290–94) discusses the relevance
for humans of intraspecies violence in nonhuman species and gives a graphic
description of the violence witnessed by Jane Goodall and her team. This vio-
lence is also described by Ghiglieri (1999, pp. 172–77), who points out that
in the chimpanzee groups he observed, recorded violence was lower than in

Notes to Chapter 4 • 323
the Goodall groups, apparently because the former had reached a more stable
accommodation between groups: each group had enough males to make defense
possible without making attack attractive. The best (and best-written) overview
of great-ape violence is certainly Wrangham & Peterson (1996), which is more
balanced and less sensationalist than its title (“Demonic Males”) might lead one
to expect.
8. Lorenz 1963.
9. The evidence about human violence in general is controversial, and ques-
tions about causality (such as whether there is an “instinct” for violence) are
even more controversial than questions about the incidence of violence at par-
ticular times and places. For the argument I advance in this chapter it is enough
to show that human societies have usually been violent in the absence of institu-
tions for deterring violent behavior. Gat (2006) is far the best overall treatment.
Bowles (2009) is a careful summary of evidence about violence among foragers.
Ember (1978) is an early survey of warfare (inter alia) among hunter-gatherers,
and Gat (2000a,b) among preindustrial societies more generally. Ferguson & Gat
(2000) debate the reliability of this evidence. Gat (1999, 2006) also contain evi-
dence about the nature and purposes of such violence. A sobering overview of
the human species’ capacity for murderous violence is Diamond (1993, chap-
ter 16). Robarchek & Robarchek (1997) compare two societies that, at the time of
observation, had very diﬀerent violence levels, though the more peaceful com-
munity (the Semai Senoi of Malaysia) had in previous years been successfully
recruited into the anticommunist armies used by the British colonial adminis-
tration, where they became ruthless and eﬃcient killers (Ghiglieri 1999, p. 185).

10. However, the strength of the reciprocity motivation may have important
implications for the ways in which cooperative behavior can be encouraged in
practice. For instance, there is evidence that increasing penalties for tax evasion
may sometimes result in reduced tax compliance, because it is interpreted by
previously honest taxpayers as a signal that many others are dishonest, thereby
prompting them to reduce their own compliance; see Kahan 2003.

laughter and other similar primate expressions such as the “play face.”
21. Ekman et al. 1988; Frank et al. 1993. Mehu et al. (2007) show that smiles in
general are associated with cooperative dispositions and are found frequently
in situations involving sharing.
22. Krumhuber et al. 2007.
23. There are other theories of the evolution of laughter, not necessar-
ily incompatible with the one outlined here. For instance, Ramachandran &
Blakeslee (1999) propose that laughter evolved to signal to other members of
a social group that a feared threat (from a predator, for instance) is in fact
not serious. This makes sense of the resemblance to the “play face” and could
explain why we laugh in relief. This could in turn account for the use of laughter
to signal to a listener that the person laughing is not himself a threat.
24. Gray & McNaughton 2000, chapter 4.
25. It’s true that drinks tend to be served after agreements are signed, but
trust is as important after the agreement as before: each party still needs to
decide whether it can trust the other to stick to the agreement.

ple (see Zahavi 1975) may also be at work; by drinking alcohol in your company,
I am signaling that I am so conﬁdent in my skill at discerning your trustworthi-
ness that I am willing to disable it with a powerful depressant drug. This can
work both to reassure you that I intend to trust you (by behaving in a trustworthy

Chapter 5. How Did the Social Emotions Evolve?
1. Lerner et al. (2007) have shown that cortisol responses to stressful situ-
ations vary crucially according to whether fear or indignation components are
most important in the emotional characterization of the situation, with cortisol
elevated by fear and lowered by indignation.
2. Marmot (2004). It was widely believed until recently that in nonhuman pri-
mate groups exactly the same thing was true, but when it was ﬁrst possible to
measure cortisol levels of primate groups in the wild, some slightly surprising
results emerged. An interesting paper by Muller & Wrangham (2004) showed
that cortisol levels were positively correlated with dominance among chim-
panzees in the wild. The authors suggest that this is because dominant chim-
panzees in the wild spend a great deal of energy maintaining their dominance—
more so, certainly, than senior civil servants have to do.

War
1. Calvino 1991, pp. 20–23.
2. Quotations from the proceedings are from Marrus (1997, especially pp.
182, 206, 217). The English version is given as in Marrus, even where the trans-
lation is evidently slightly faulty (as in “pity with” instead of “pity for”). Overy
(2001) is a fascinating account of the interrogation of Nazi leaders before the
trial, reproducing many original transcripts.
3. Brendon 2000, p. 404. Nevertheless, though the Nuremberg trials brought
out these tensions explicitly and in a starker form than ever before or since,
the sense that the life of a complex society encourages a single-mindedness
essential to our success, while simultaneously provoking deep unease at the
eﬀects of this single-mindedness on the quality of our lives, has been with us
for many centuries.
4. The evolution of human mental capacities, especially for broad, abstract
reasoning, is the subject of Mithen (1996), whose main focus is the development
of consciousness; on Mithen’s view many of these mental capacities are by-
products of skills that evolved for ecological adaptation and social interaction.
Miller (2000) proposes sexual selection as an explanation: far from being a by-
product, human mental abilities were actively selected by females. In fact, the
two theories are less starkly opposed than they may appear: the particular forms
of mental capacity that were sexually selected were not necessarily the ones we
see today, and sexual interaction was surely one of the most important forms
of social interaction driving the evolutionary process.
5. Hall 1998, pp. 48, 58.
6. An intriguing account of this process in the U.S. Navy is given in Hutchins
(1995, especially pp. 6–26).
7. Dumont 1981.
8. Donne 1997, pp. 126–27.
9. Durkheim’s theory of suicide is set out in Durkheim (1897). He proposed
four types of suicide, distinguishing notably between egoistic suicide, which
was driven by lack of social integration in modern society, and anomic suicide,
which was driven by lack of social regulation. A sense of some of the empirical
and conceptual controversy still surrounding these ideas can be gained from
the readings in Lester (1994), though the discussions of the empirical material
are neither very clear nor (to my mind) very convincing.

15. This work is reviewed in Fehr & Gächter (2000a).
16. Case et al. 2000 and Cox 2001, for example. Bergstrom (1996) discusses
the signiﬁcance of kin selection for the economics of the family, and Robson
(2001) surveys what evolutionary biology has to say about economic preferences
and the nature of economic rationality. Cronk et al. (2000) consists of essays
exploring adaptive explanations for phenomena documented by anthropolo-
gists; Dunbar et al. (1999) also contains much interesting material. Hirshleifer
(1977) is an early and still very readable discussion of the links between biology
and economics, and Ghiselin (2001) provides a large bibliography.

Francois & van Ypersele (2009) for a cross-country econometric study suggest-

18. That the character of societies can be far removed from the intentions
of individuals is something of a truism in sociology; see Barnes (1995) for a
survey of the main sociological approaches to understanding social interaction.
This concept was central to the work of Durkheim, especially his book On the
Division of Labor in Society, ﬁrst published in 1893 (1998). Kaufmann (1995)
describes the general insights of complex systems theory into the nature of
self-organizing structures.

Notes to Chapter 13 • 333
15. The comparative study of British and American blood transfusion sys-
tems—one relying on donations, the other to a much greater extent on sales—
was the subject of a classic study by Titmuss (1970), who claimed that paying
people to give blood was ineﬃcient as well as unethical, because it resulted
in higher levels of infected blood and less willingness to provide blood among
people who would otherwise have been willing to do so for free (this last phe-
nomenon is known as “crowding-out” of altruism by ﬁnancial incentives). See
also the review essays by Solow (1971) and Arrow (1972). Surprisingly, Titmuss’s
hypothesis was not subjected to an experimental test in the realm of blood dona-
tion until the work of Mellström & Johannesson (2008); they found no statisti-
cally signiﬁcant crowding-out on average but did ﬁnd it among women subjects.
Bénabou & Tirole (2006) and Seabright (2009a) discuss ways of understand-
ing crowding-out phenomena as a form of social signaling. Anderson (1995) is
a careful (though in my view largely unconvincing) statement of the case for
refusing to trade in many of the controversial areas listed in the text.

Chapter 13. Families and Firms
1. The classic source for this question about the boundaries of ﬁrms is Coase
(1937). One of the collections in which it is republished (Putterman & Kroszner
1996) contains many useful essays dealing with this and related questions. Hart
(1995, especially part 1) is a good undergraduate-level overview, Williamson
(1985) a less formal one, and a classic reference for what has come to be known
as “transactions cost economics.” Aoki (2001) is a comprehensive monograph
reviewing contributions to the economics of institutions in the transactions cost
tradition. Mokyr (2002, particularly chapter 4) provides an excellent historical
perspective on the impact of technical change on the size and character of ﬁrms
since the industrial revolution.
2. On output, see Bourguignon & Morrison (2002, table 1); on energy and
freshwater, see McNeill (2000, tables 1.5 and 5.1).
3. The exceptions include, not just plantation agriculture in the Americas,
but also the great European feudal estates; it is also true that even family farms
have often been active in labor markets, hiring in or hiring out labor according
to the rhythms of the agricultural year.
4. The material on Henry Ford in this chapter is drawn from Hall (1998, chap-
ter 13).
5. A remarkable exception is reported by Jones (1988): “before the birth of
Christ an ironmaster in Szechuan was employing 1,000 men” (p. 74).

has used the converse argument to point to the absence of mass demand as a
reason why a number of episodes of striking economic growth in the premodern
world were not sustained: “concentration on products for which there could be
no mass demand and from which there were few spin-oﬀs slowed an economic
advance that was technically within the reach of some organized society.”
19. Lamoreaux et al. (2002) gives an interesting account of the evolution of
the textile and other light industries in early nineteenth-century New England,
from a structure based on families and family control to a more centralized
factory system. For example, owners of the new large mills built in the second
and third decades of the century “needed many more workers than could be
obtained from local farm households[;] they had to convince young, unmarried
women from all over New England to come work temporarily in the mills. In
order to make factory employment more attractive to this group, they invested
in boarding houses and educational institutions.”

ing their production, diﬀerences that could persist over many decades.

29. Hutchins (1995) describes in detail how the diﬀerent cognitive tasks

tributed process into a recognizably coherent response to a cognitive problem.

and on their impact on warfare, migration, and the development of civiliza-
tion. Among the intriguing details (p. 196): “at least seventy-seven ancestral
mares…are required to account for the genetic variety in modern populations
around the globe. Wild mares must have been taken into domesticated horse
herds in many diﬀerent places at diﬀerent times. Meanwhile, the male aspect
of modern horse DNA…shows remarkable homogeneity. It is possible that just
a single wild stallion was domesticated.”

2. Mithen (1996) cites Glyn Isaac as describing how “for almost a million
years, toolkits tended to involve the same essential ingredients seemingly being
shuﬄed in restless, minor, directionless changes” (p. 19).
3. The evolution of human culture is a central theme of Klein & Edgar (2001)
and Klein (2009, especially chapter 8); the authors support the hypothesis of
African origins but favor the hypothesis of a relatively sudden transformation.
McBrearty & Brooks (2000) argue strongly in favor of a more gradual African
evolution. Mithen (1996) has an excellent account of the challenge of explain-
ing the development of human cultural and cognitive capacities, as well as an
intriguing hypothesis about how it might have happened.
4. This remains a speculation, though, and it is hard to see what evidence
could, realistically, conﬁrm or refute it.
5. Not all specialists would accept this characterization: Sue Blackmore, for
instance, tells me, in a personal communication, that she doesn’t see why sym-
bolic representation is necessary for imitation. My own view is that imitation
as such had been a feature of human behavior long before the developments
we can describe as culture (all those unchanging stone tools), but it was the
ﬂuidity of symbolic recombination that gave imitation the explosive potential
so grippingly described in Blackmore (1999).
6. And the brain itself uses symbols which are not necessarily images to rep-
resent external objects (see Ramachandran & Blakeslee (1999, chapter 4) for a
particularly clear and intuitive account of this point of view). So a more general
reliance on symbols rather than more speciﬁcally on images for communication
is a natural extension of our biological capacities from the perceptual sphere to
the sphere of communication.
7. Mithen 1996, pp. 160–61. One of the key pieces of evidence is the structure
and position of the larynx, which in humans carries a much greater risk of chok-
ing than in apes. This risk implies that there must already have been adaptive

336 • Notes to Chapter 14
beneﬁts from the greater capacity of the human larynx to produce sounds suit-
able for language; otherwise there would have been strong selective pressures
against its evolution.
8. Whiten et al. 1999; Whiten & Boesch 2001.
9. Diamond 1992, pp. 133–35. It is likely that the increased life span coe-
volved with increased brain size, since larger brains do not instantly increase
ﬁtness but, rather, raise the returns to learning, which is a type of investment.
This would therefore have increased the overall adaptive value of longer life
expectancy, since it gave a longer period in which learning investments would
be productive. See KaplanHurtado et al. (2000) and Robson & Kaplan (2003).
10. The citations about the impact of printing are from Eisenstein (1982),
which was reissued in abridged form as Eisenstein (1993). A ﬁne social history
of printing is Febvre & Martin (1997), while Martin (1994) connects the history
of printing with that of writing and literacy more generally.
11. This is compatible with a large increase in absolute rewards for those
whose talents appeal to a geographically dispersed audience who can be brought
together by the cheap reproduction and diﬀusion of information goods. I recall
reading somewhere that Joseph Losey’s movie version of Don Giovanni has been
seen by more people than have seen the live opera in the more than two centuries
since Mozart wrote it.
12. Frank 1999, p. 38. A previous book by the same author (Frank 1996) was
devoted entirely to such markets and their eﬀects on society. The underlying
idea was ﬁrst developed by Rosen (1981).

20. Kremer & Snyder (2003) have argued that a similar problem explains why
private-sector pharmaceutical companies invest less in vaccines than in curative
drugs.

as “latent inhibition.”
23. Cognitive psychologist Colin Martindale has advanced the theory that
the changing characteristics of all artistic movements can be explained by pres-
sure for novelty generated by the habituation of artistic audiences to familiar
stimuli (Martindale 1990); such a theory seems naturally suited to explaining an
increasing shrillness of artistic movements as they struggle to compete in a sym-
bolically overpopulated space of public attention. An interesting comparison is

lived for nearly a year in 1985 and which I revisited in 1990 and 1992. Research
ﬁndings from these villages have resulted in several publications, one of which
is Seabright (1997). Bliss & Stern (1983) is a detailed and fascinating case study
of the north Indian village of Palanpur, revisited in Lanjouw & Stern (1998). The
best general-purpose textbook on economic development is Ray (1998), though
Basu (1998) has some excellent chapters, particularly the early ones. Bardhan &
Udry (1999) is a good advanced undergraduate textbook on institutional aspects

5. Assortative matching is discussed nontechnically in chapter 5 of Cohen
(1998) and technically in Shimer & Smith (2000). It has been applied to under-
standing a wide range of phenomena, including growing inequality in household
income (Deaton 1995; Lerman 1996), poverty traps in developing economies
(Kremer 1993), peer-group lending in poor countries (Ghatak 1999), rising
divorce rates (Weiss 1997), transmission rates of HIV infection (Dow & Philip-
son 1996), racial and class segregation in the schooling system (Bénabou 1994),
and the changing employment structure of U.S. ﬁrms (Kremer & Maskin 1996;
Acemoglu 1999; Mailath et al. 2000).
6. One piece of evidence suggesting this may be an important phenomenon is
presented in Hamermesh (2001), who argues that measures of job satisfaction—
which are likely to be very sensitive to the quality of a person’s coworkers—have
become more unequal in both the United States and Germany in recent years.

Epilogue to Part
III
1. Schelling (1978) is a superb introduction to the issues.
2. Krugman (1991) remains the best introduction to this literature. See also
Fujita et al. (1999) and the review essay by Neary (2001).
3. Seabright (1993) and Portney (2000) are two introductory essays; Pearce &
Turner (1990), a textbook treatment, Dasgupta (1993, 2001), two comprehensive
monographs, and Dasgupta & Mäler (1997), a set of essays about problems of
environment and development.
4. See McMillan (2002) and Harford (2005) for two very readable introduc-
tions.
5. Farrell (1987) provides a very clear account of the reasons why asymme-
tries of information prevent eﬃcient bargaining of the kind necessary for the
Coase theorem to hold.
Prologue to Part
IV
1. Weisdorf (2005) provides an excellent survey.
2. I have developed the argument about defense and the adoption of agricul-
ture more fully with Bob Rowthorn in Rowthorn & Seabright (2009). Evidence
about the existence of multiple independent adoptions is summarized in Rich-
erson et al. (2001), and the rapid spread of agriculture around the world is
documented in Bellwood (1996) and Cavalli-Sforza et al. (1994). Barker (2006)
provides an encyclopedic overview of what is known about the origins of agri-
culture, emphasizing among other things how many communities had adopted
practices that made agriculture a more natural option than it would otherwise

Notes to Chapter 16 • 339
have been (a point also made by Tudge (1999)). As Mithen (1996) points out, ear-
lier humans had sophisticated biological knowledge, so that it does not seem
likely that their disinclination to adopt agriculture lay in lack of skill. Exist-
ing theories are dominated by two hypotheses: that of a late Pleistocene food
crisis caused by population pressure (Cohen 1977) and that of rapid climate
change including global warming (Richardson et al. 2001). The ﬁrst is problem-
atic because of evidence that hunter-gatherers were able to control population
growth through various measures, including infanticide. According to Cohen &
Armelagos (1984), the second may only be a necessary and not a suﬃcient con-
dition for adoption of agriculture, given the evidence about the health of early
farmers. Given that evidence, climate change might not have increased agricul-
tural productivity enough to make its adoption inevitable. As Mithen points out,
many previous episodes of comparable climate change had not led to agricul-
ture. Two additional theories help explain why adoption of agriculture could
have led to a “point of no return,” though neither explains the initial adoption.
Bar-Yosef & Belfer-Cohen (1989) suggest that sedentism removed constraints
to population growth and made a return to hunting and gathering impossible.
Winterhalder & Lu (1995) suggest that more intense hunting by already seden-
tary communities would have depleted big game, with the same consequence
of rendering a return to hunting and gathering impossible. This hypothesis is
strongly corroborated by data in Stutz et al. (2009). And Mithen himself oﬀers
his account of an evolving human consciousness as a way of explaining why
modern humans might have been more aware of the possibilities of agriculture
than their biologically sophisticated, but less symbolically creative, forebears:
they knew about wild animals and plants but were not used to thinking of them
as potentially domesticable.
So my suggestion that defense needs imposed important externalities is best
seen as a way to reconcile the evidence about the health of early farmers with
the possibility that climate change might nevertheless have made agriculture
suﬃciently productive to become strongly attractive to individual communi-
ties. That defense needs were an important preoccupation of early agricultural
societies is strongly argued by Gat (2006).
3. This point therefore also applies to some hunter-gatherer societies like
the salmon ﬁshers of the Paciﬁc Northwest that had become relatively seden-
tary (and also therefore large, complex, and socially stratiﬁed) because of the
immobile nature of their hunting grounds.
4. Ferguson 1773, p. 218. I owe both this and my acquaintance with Ibn Khal-
dun (1377) to the excellent book by Gellner (1994), on pp. 62–63 of which I
originally came across the reference to Ferguson.
Chapter 16. States and Empires
1. Cavalli-Sforza 2000, pp. 104–13. Renfrew (1989) is a treatment of the puz-
zle of the origins of Indo-European languages that also depends on the hypoth-
esis of a gradual spread of a technology (in this case, a linguistic technology)
carried by the spread of agriculture.

6. Richards (2003) reports point estimates for the proportion of mitochon-
drial DNA from Neolithic migrants from Turkey in northern Greek populations
to be around 20% and the proportion of Y-chromosome DNA to be around
25%—a higher proportion of the latter being expected if indigenous females
were incorporated into the migrants’ gene pool at a higher rate than indigenous
males.
7. The claim that almost no societies refrained from enslaving others at some
time in their history, and that slavery became more likely the wealthier the
society concerned, was due at ﬁrst to Nieboer (1900, especially pp. 255–61,
286–88, 294, 303, 306, and 417–27). I am grateful to Stanley Engerman for this
reference. The classic source for the economics of slavery is Fogel & Engerman
(1974).

16. This view is reviewed and rejected in Keeley (1996, especially pp. 121–
26). Gat (2006) defends a more nuanced version of the view, which is that states
that have overcome the Malthusian population trap have more reason to avoid
conﬂict since they have more to lose; trade may play a part in the generation
of that prosperity. However, if you are more prosperous this gives you a reason
to avoid conﬂict with any opponent, not necessarily only your close trading
partners.

the Hereros, see Diamond (1992, pp. 278–88).
18. Hochschild 1999, passim, but especially chapter 15. Such slaughter may
even have been encouraged by the fact that, with the end of slavery, these inhab-
itants no longer represented an economic resource for their murderers; they
were simply in the way.
19. The argument that asymmetries in size and strength explain violence
between adults in some species is discussed in Wrangham & Peterson (1996,

2. For the inﬂuenza pandemic, see Taubenberger & Morens (2006). Keeley

future—targeted viruses that can kill massive numbers of an enemy population
while leaving a domestic population unharmed, and do not need sophisticated
delivery mechanisms might be one way—but this remains entirely speculative.
7. Geoﬀrey Hawthorn tells me the story of a popular Venezuelan rock band
that was asked by the FARC to play for them. The band said it required twenty
thousand dollars, a decent stadium to play in, and safe passage to and from
Caracas. No problem, said the FARC. The band had its fee, a private jet to and
from the venue, and at the venue itself a large stadium with state-of-the-art
sound and lighting. In itself trivial, but indicative of how much nonstates can
conﬁdently control.
8. Gladwell (2000) provides an excellent account of the way in which ideas
(including panics) can spread, emphasizing the role of certain key individuals
with large numbers of links to others and a strong persuasive power. This means
that societies can have hubs in the realm of ideas even if their physical and
formal organizational hubs are few.
