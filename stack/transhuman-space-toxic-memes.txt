INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION

There is nothing so bizarre, so irrational, so oth-
erworldly that somebody, somewhere, won’t believe
it. This is all the more true in 2100, after the science of
memetics – the analysis and engineering of ideas – has
reached its full fruition. Detailed knowledge of how
human and artificial minds work has given cult leaders,
conspiracy theorists, advertisers, and rumormongers a
fresh toolkit with which to ply their trades. The results
aren’t always pretty.
Toxic Memes dives head first into the swamp of
myths, movements, and manipulation that characterizes
life in 2100. It details how memetics fits into the world of
Transhuman Space, and the technologies and techniques
that make memetics so powerful. Toxic Memes also pro-
vides a catalog of the weird beliefs, political agendas, post-
modern urban legends, and nonhuman ravings that flourish
at the end of the 21st century.

Memetics – the science of idea propagation and repli-
cation – is a cornerstone of the world in 2100. While this
study of how belief is shaped and transmitted has mutated
fields from sociology to advertising, it has most affected
politics and religion. Memetics has set off a cognitive arms
race by giving powerful new tools to those who manipu-
late thinking, and granting others greater comprehension
of how such manipulation happens . . . and the power to
avoid it.
Civilization at the edge of the 22nd century is a stark-
ly Darwinian environment of ideas, all competing for the
limited resource of attention. Memetics draws a close anal-
ogy between genes, the units of biological evolution, and
memes, the units of cognitive and cultural evolution,
allowing memeticists to study the spread of ideas just as an
epidemiologist studies the spread of disease. But memetic
science in 2100 goes even further, with increasingly pow-
erful techniques for the creation of ideas that audiences
will find compelling or even life changing. 
In a world filled with memes, only the catchy survive.
Some memes thrive by being demonstrably more effec-
tive, proving their value through sheer abundance of evi-
dence. Other memes survive by being more interesting,
amusing, seductive, or persuasive than their competitors,
picked up and transmitted not because they provide obvi-
ous value but because they have been sculpted to appeal
to many minds.

COGNITIVE ECOLOGIES
OVERVIEW:
COGNITIVE ECOLOGIES

By 2100, this basic observation has itself
evolved into a far-reaching science of human cogni-
tion, as well as a complex methodology for generating
and manipulating ideas. No longer limited to memes-as-
metaphor, scientific memetics examines precisely how
ideas trigger responses in minds. Memetics sits at the
crossroads of psychology, sociology, neurophysiology,
and artificial-intelligence research. 
THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES
For all of the massive technological transformations
of the 21st century, the development with the greatest
potential to alter how humanity and its children think of
themselves had its roots in a century-old book about
evolution.
Dawkins
A small section in a 1976 book called The Selfish
Gene triggered the study of memetics. Its author,
Richard Dawkins, was a leading late-20th/early-21st-
century evolutionary biologist. In one of the book’s later
chapters, he described his concept of cultural evolution
as part of a larger discussion of replicators. He carefully
avoided claims that culture was genetic, but stated that
just as biological evolution was based (in his view) on
competition between genes, cultural evolution was
based on competition between replicating cultural units:
memes.
While the notion of biological analogies for culture
wasn’t new – see, for example, William S. Burroughs’
observation that “language is a virus” – Dawkins’ take
on it was. By giving it a clear articulation, scientific cre-
dence, and a catchy name, he gave the idea life. In the
decades since, the “meme” meme has proven remark-
ably powerful. 
Memes and Memeplexes
So what exactly is a meme? It is an idea, broadly
speaking. A song, a political opinion, a scientific conjec-
ture – all can be memes. They exist and have value, in
large measure due to their appeal to our minds. Even
physical objects have memetic aspects: when we
describe a tangible item as being “elegant,” “cleverly
designed,” or “cool,” we are discussing its memetic
characteristics.
The more a meme appeals, the more likely we are
to remember it and to pass it along to others. This com-
munication of a meme can be as simple as telling it to
someone or as complex as writing out elaborate design
plans. Physical manifestations of memes can even
serve as a medium of propagation: simply seeing the
result of an innovative idea (such as a keystone arch)
can implant the meme, leading to its eventual 
reproduction elsewhere. 
Before the rise of memetics, the crafting of
ideas was the work of artisans, using techniques they
couldn’t fully explain or even understand. These
“memetic alchemists” – as LOGOS, the AI who kicked
off the memetics revolution, described them – often came
up with slogans that swayed public opinion, but not reli-
ably. With the development of memetics, what had been
ritual soon became science. Those who wished to change
minds now understood precisely how to do it.
Not all of the memes created using these new tools
were, or are, for the betterment of mankind. The world of
2100 is awash in carefully designed memes intended to
persuade, amuse, and inspire – yet it is also full of memes
created to frighten, dominate, and mislead. Some of the
memes out there are simply toxic.
Toxic Memes describes the weird, twisted, and some-
times baffling mental landscape of the end of the 21st cen-
tury. In 2100, memetics is a well-understood, widely used
discipline. A century of development has resulted in
sophisticated tools for storytelling, propaganda, and adver-
tising – tools that can be, and are, also used for more nefar-
ious purposes. It’s not enough to be skeptical – cognitive
survival depends on the realization that every idea has lay-
ers, that you may not even be able to trust what you see and
feel, and that no truth is unvarnished.
MEMETICS
AND MEMES
The science of memetics is based upon a relatively
straightforward (if originally controversial) notion: ideas
behave like biological entities. They are “replicators,” in
the language of evolutionary biologists, able to duplicate
themselves without losing the original copy. As with
genes, they are subject to variation – the replication can be
imperfect, leading to slight differences between versions.
They are subject to “selection,” where environmental pres-
sures can lead to some ideas doing better than others. The
combination of replication, variation, and selection means
that ideas evolve. Just as genes are the primary units of
biological evolution, ideas – memes – are the primary
units of cultural evolution.
OVERVIEW

In a world filled with
memes, only the catchy
survive.

Memes interact and compete. If one meme runs up
against a contrary meme, our evaluation of the validity of
each meme is contingent upon a variety of other memes
we may hold true. For example, two contrary memes
could be “there are Nazis living in the center of the
Earth” and “the Earth’s center is molten rock and metal,”
with a contingent meme of “the government always hides
the truth, and scientists are in on the deception.” This
internal assortment of memes is often not terribly consis-
tent, and can change greatly over time.
Memes can change, too. New memes can alter our
interpretation and evaluation of older ones, and observa-
tions of the real-world utility of various memes can
change our perceptions. Historically, the act of commu-
nicating memes also led to their alteration, as individual
emphasis, forgetfulness, and storytelling ability could
greatly alter the makeup of a given concept. Technology
has slowly reduced this source of variation. Writing, pho-
tography, digital duplication, and, by the late 21st centu-
ry, ever-present AI assistance each increased the overall
fidelity of memetic communication, thereby reducing the
likelihood of unintentional “memetic mutation.”
Changes to one memetic element can have cascading
effects, as few memes exist entirely in isolation. Memeti-
cists refer to interrelated collections of memes that more
or less co-evolve as “memeplexes.” Well-constructed
memeplexes can prove a formidable barrier to memetic
change, as each element reinforces the others. When 
one element of a memeplex is refuted, however, the self-
reinforcing nature becomes a liability, and the whole
cognitive edifice can collapse. Political and 
religious views are traditional examples of memeplexes.
In common usage, however, the word “meme” covers
everything from basic idea fragments to elaborate
philosophies; irritation over the incorrect usage of the
term is a common quirk among professional memetic
engineers.
THE EVOLUTION OF MEMETICS
Over the hundred-plus years since Dawkins first
described the concept, the notion of the meme has gone
through a considerable transformation.
1976-2015: The Pioneers
The early days of memetics were filled with contro-
versy. Many anthropologists and cognitive scientists flat-
ly denied that memes existed as more than crude analogy;
others attempted to co-opt memetics into their existing
fields, claiming that memetics was simply an elaboration
of existing ideas. Theorists such as Daniel Dennett,
Susan Blackmore, and Robert Aunger tried to develop a
more rigorous version of memetics, one that could stand
on its own. Unfortunately, these early memeticists often
worked at cross-purposes, and eventually split into two
squabbling camps. One side promoted memes as cogni-
tive artifacts, while the other argued that there was evi-
dence from neuroscience for the existence of memes as
manifestations of brain biology. Neither side provided
conclusive evidence, and the field gradually fell to the
sidelines.

OVERVIEW
Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, 
clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches.
Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping
from body to body via sperms or eggs, so memes propagate
themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via
a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation. If
a scientist hears, or reads about, a good idea, he passes it on to
his colleagues and students. He mentions it in his articles and
his lectures. If the idea catches on, it can be said to propagate
itself, spreading from brain to brain.
– Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, 1976

preventing them from making the necessary
breakthroughs. LOGOS faced no such problems. 
In 2078, LOGOS produced its groundbreaking
treatise on memetics, The Propagation of Human Ideas
(often referred to as PHI), dedicated to Richard
Dawkins. Declaring that memetics was an inherently
complex system, with both feed-forward and feedback
effects, LOGOS proceeded to use the complexity map-
ping techniques developed over the course of the 21st
century to detail how ideas emerge, evolve, and
expand. While dense with mathematics and hard for
most to comprehend, PHI soon took its place as the cor-
nerstone of the new science of memetics.
The second edition of PHI, published in 2082,
greatly extended and revised the original theory.
LOGOS (and a variety of collaborators) connected the
neurobiology of cognition with the original concept of
idea propagation, giving memeticists crucial insights
into how ideas take hold. Memetic scientists now
had a working model of how memes emerge in
the mind, how they evolve in the social envi-
ronment, and how they expand from mind to
mind. The use of memetics exploded. 
2090-2099:
The Memetic Engineers
By the beginning of the 2090s, memetics had
moved into the public spotlight, but not without con-
troversy. Many critics argued that memetics was dan-
gerous, the ultimate tool for despots wishing to control
the beliefs and opinions of their people. To the surprise
and relief of most, the “propaganda state” proved diffi-
cult to create, as the scientific understanding of ideas
also gave individuals the tools with which to recognize
when memetic techniques were being employed
against them. Pundits referred to it as the “democrati-
zation of the meme,” and they weren’t far off. The last
decade has seen memetics transform from a special-
ized, almost secret technique into something that near-
ly anyone can employ. 
But what some called “democratization,” others
called a “cognitive arms race.” By far the most frus-
trating issue for applied memetics is that, because peo-
ple are increasingly aware of memetic techniques,
processes that work one year can fail utterly the next.
Skepticism and other “countermemes” spread easily.
Rather than turning advertising, entertainment, political
persuasion, and the like into formal, calm disciplines,
the application of memetic principles resulted in near-
chaos. By describing beliefs and opinions as contin-
gent, external agents constructed to influence
outcomes, popular memetics has made the work of
memetic engineers significantly more difficult than
ever before. 
2015-2041: The Dark Ages
For much of the first few decades of the 21st
century, most of the few people who even knew of
memetics saw it as a fad science. Some of its more
important early ideas were absorbed into existing, more
traditional fields, and only a handful of theorists kept
working on the concept. Among the few remaining
memeticists was a young Australian named Kyle
Porters, who embraced the idea that memes – in the
guise of information – were at the core of culture and
society. While his subsequent development of infoso-
cialism bore few direct connections to the early ver-
sions of memetics, much of the language used by
theory-steeped European infosocialists to this day
echoes the work of protomemeticists. As a result of this
connection, by mid-century most references to memes
were sure to include a dismissive reference to Porters
and infosocialism.
2041-2078: The Brain Hackers
Advances in biotechnology, computer science, and
nanotechnology throughout the 2020s and 2030s led to
great leaps forward in understanding brain function.
Memory and cognition could be mapped with increas-
ing accuracy, and researchers were able to make physi-
cal connections between biological consciousness and
sophisticated low-sapient machines. By the early
2040s, neuroscientists had functional maps of the entire
brain, leading to the first virtual interface implants in
the brain in 2043 (approved for general use in 2047),
and the first sensory link (“slink”) systems in 2048
(made available to the public in 2052). By the mid-
2060s, the construction of the first full-scale brain emu-
lations – “shadows” – made it possible to track
precisely how thoughts were formed, replay complex
patterns, even alter memories and beliefs to see how
changes affected thought and behavior. Cognitive sci-
entists made enormous advances in understanding the
physiology of consciousness throughout the middle of
the century, but because memetics had been largely for-
gotten, the links between how the brain created and
evaluated ideas and how those ideas propagated in soci-
ety were not explored.
2078-2090: Enter the Machine
In 2070, curious about how ideas (such as fears
about artificial intelligence) come about and spread,
LOGOS, the first sapient AI, began its research into
human social cognition. LOGOS soon realized that the
turn-of-the-century memeticists were tantalizingly
close to real insights, and spent a great deal of its early
research evaluating their work. It concluded that
humans lacked understanding of how the brain grap-
pled with ideas and could not examine their own cog-
nitive processes completely or objectively,
OVERVIEW

Memetics 2100
At the end of the 21st century, memetics combines
the study of mass propagation maps (how ideas spread)
with individual neurobiology (how ideas take hold). The
practice of memetics has spread into most endeavors based
on creating or communicating ideas, from advertising and
politics to romance and office intrigues. Very little com-
munication intended for an audience is done without a
careful memetic check, referred to as “concept wind-tun-
neling.” How will the recipient react? What other memes
might the communication support or suppress? In what
ways might the meme evolve? Much of the day-to-day use
of memetics concerns avoiding bad reactions, not the more
difficult task of crafting good reactions. 
That’s not to say that memes intended to propagate
quickly and effectively aren’t being created – they are, and
in abundance. The tools for creating sophisticated memes
and memeplexes are widespread, as is the desire to con-
vince people of a product’s value or the validity of one’s
views. Memetic techniques and systems improve with
each passing day, allowing the creation of increasing num-
bers of complex, adaptive, and very persuasive memes.
THE MEMETIC
SOCIETY
Although memetic science is barely two decades old,
it has already transformed many aspects of life at the end
of the 21st century. Few people in Fourth and, especially,
Fifth Wave societies are ignorant of the ways in which
memetics influences behavior. Pop-memetics texts
and InVids are commonplace, and while the fad of sprin-
kling memetic science jargon throughout casual conversa-
tion to appear cutting edge has mercifully faded, the
average citizen of the hyperdeveloped world is fairly
familiar with the basics of memetic techniques.
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
Although any occupation involving the creation or
transmission of ideas has a memetic aspect, not every
advertiser, politician, or religious leader needs expertise in
memetic science. Memetics is a difficult discipline to mas-
ter. Organizations needing assistance in crafting influential
memes usually rely upon trained memetic engineers.
(There are many memetic professions – see Characters, p.
130.) Although some professional memeticists may choose
to promote themselves, most work behind the scenes.
The details of memetic engineering may be difficult to
learn, but the basics are fairly straightforward. Memes and
memeplexes, regardless of type, have several characteris-
tics in common. Most popularized approaches to memetics
focus on these elements – the “Three P’s” – as well as 
standard techniques to manipulate them.
Populations
Finding the right recipients for a meme is as important
as constructing the meme itself. What is the nature of the
audience? What is its size? What fractions are expected to
receive the memes, transmit them to others, and reject
them? A great deal of successful memetic engineering
comes from detailed understanding of the target audience.
Memeticists have a saying: “Amateurs talk content; 
professionals talk populations.”
Propagation
Memes can be spread by any medium capable of com-
municating an idea, but determining the right one can be
crucial for the eventual success of the memetic exercise.
Getting a meme to the recipients who are (a) likely hosts
and (b) likely vectors is the action step of memetic engi-
neering. Coming up with a beautifully articulated idea
doesn’t mean much if you can’t get it to people who will
appreciate it. 
Medium is important. Word of mouth and InVid are
commonly used media, but artwork and artifacts also
spread memes. The same idea in a song, in a

COGNITIVE ECOLOGIES
My meme hacker mapped the propagation of the
Neo-Sufi memeplex in late-2096 southern France. She
told me Neo-Sufism was displacing the Buddhist ‘plex,
fitting in that same niche, so I told Leo to move pro-

Memes do not exist in a vacuum. They require an
established cultural or social environment of existing
memes and memeplexes in which to flourish or compete.
The pop-memetic term for this is a “memespace,” but
professionals usually call this realm a cognitive ecology.
For a meme to survive, it needs to fit in with other memes
already present in a given society; a well-crafted, hardy
meme will fail to propagate if nobody in the audience
understands what it refers to, just as even the most
aggressive kudzu would be hard-pressed to do well in an
arid desert.
documentary, and in an advertisement will elicit very dif-
ferent responses from different people. Critically, these
responses can be situationally negative – a person likely to
accept a meme as part of a song may react very negative-
ly to the same meme presented in an advertisement.
Persistence
Memetic persistence is a subtle issue, as it’s not
always in the best interest of a memeticist to construct last-
ing memes. While long-lived memes can be powerful, they
are very difficult to construct successfully and sometimes
take on a life of their own . . . what professional memeti-
cists refer to as “going feral.” If long-lived memes are
required, they usually need to be memeplexes, as complex
sets are typically more robust in the face of opposition. The
main drawback is that rejection of one part of a sophisti-
cated memeplex often results in the rejection of the entire
cognitive edifice – “catastrophic collapse,” in memeticist
jargon.
Some memes should be transient, lasting just long
enough to affect behavior, but not so long as to make peo-
ple think about the meme. Larger memetic campaigns
often make use of such transient memes, with new ideas
emerging and dying off quickly, each influencing a small
group. These gentle nudges can add up. Such micro-meme
campaigns are increasingly common, since smaller memes
are often harder to analyze, can appear innocuous on their
own, and are less subject to wholesale rejection than 
larger memeplexes.
OVERVIEW
11

Understanding a cognitive ecology means more
than simply studying the target audience; it means
studying the other memes the audience may be exposed to
and memes that they may have rejected in the past.
Memes, by their nature, alter the influence and growth of
seemingly unrelated concepts. For many memeticists, the
ecological metaphor is very useful, prompting them to
think in terms of memetic niches, memes competing for
resources, memetic parasites, even memes becoming
“spores,” dropping out of sight until changes to the cultur-
al environment trigger their return.
Cognitive ecologies are tricky. In 2088, shortly after
the Pacific War, the World Trade Organization contracted
Thunderbird, an Australian advertising firm, to
construct a memetic campaign for Thailand.
The campaign centered on encouraging the
formerly nanosocialist nation to abide by the
global content-rights-management (CRM)
laws. Thunderhead brought in specialists in
Thai culture, conducted multiple visits and
interviews, and brought in test audiences for
their campaign, all focusing on the myriad
ways the audience would react to ads about
CRM. Despite the research, it turned out that
the phrasing of the message, and the charac-
ters’ appearances in the ads, echoed elements
of a short-lived InVid program in the region
parodying life outside the Transpacific Social-
ist Alliance, “General Pham Says No!”
Although the show was no longer a major part
of the Thai cognitive ecology, it had left
enough “spores” that, once somebody made
the connection, a derisive countermeme spread
quickly. The ads were a dismal failure; CRM
violations in Thailand actually increased over
the subsequent year.
Persistent Memeplexes
Well-crafted, complex systems of memes
often form the bedrock of cognitive environ-
ments. As such, they can be remarkably hard to
change. The elements in the memeplex are
self-reinforcing, often structured to block
countermemes and retard evolutionary varia-
tion. From the perspective of the memes’ sur-
vival, this is a good thing – persistent
memeplexes can last for generations with sur-
prisingly little change. For people who have
adopted those memes, however, this is some-
thing of a problem – the challenges the persist-
ent memeplex was originally crafted to face
may no longer be relevant or even exist. Reli-
gions are the most commonly cited examples
of persistent memeplexes, but ideologies and
political systems often have as much or more
cultural weight.
Storytelling
Less complex than the elaborate memeplexes at the
core of an ecology, stories nonetheless play important
roles. In many respects, storytelling is the oldest form of
memetic engineering. For millennia, humans have created
alternative worlds (or fragments of worlds) to give struc-
ture to events, emphasize social norms, and entertain.
Modern meme hackers pay particular attention to story-
telling, as it’s often easier to craft persuasive memes as part
of a work of fiction than as a straight argument. Propagan-
da, conspiracies, and urban legends are often considered to
be storytelling by memeticists.

OVERVIEW
FIVE UNAVOIDABLE ADVERTISEMENTS
IN 2100
People in Fourth and Fifth Wave countries at the beginning of
2100 can’t get away from seeing or hearing these ads – many can’t
get them out of their heads!
1. “Mooshi Mooshi!” As said by Sarah the AstroBurger
spokescow. In the ads, Sarah is dressed in a kimono while introduc-
ing the restaurant chain’s new Nattoburger – all the fun of a burger
with the great taste of natto! AstroBurger claims that Sarah is a
“bovine uplift,” but most people believe that she’s actually a special-
ly designed bioroid. Children are particularly prone to screaming
“mooshi mooshi” at random times.
2. “Don’t Talk With Your Mouth Full!” Accompanied by an
image of a person with several dozen different food items sticking out
of his mouth. Ad for SpaTek’s programmable nanopaste rations, sold
in most markets under the brand name “Copia,” emphasizing the abil-
ity to select a wide assortment of food flavors. Ads usually show the
unsuspecting consumer in a public setting, and in the midst of a con-
versation, taking a bite from a Copia bar and suddenly finding his
mouth filling with different foods.
3. “Hallelujah!” The latest advertising push from Shanghai
Interactive for its new MRsiv2 virtual interface glasses. Over the
familiar strains of Handel’s Messiah, masses of people don the new
MRsiv2 VIGs, their faces (with an appropriate diversity of ethnicity,
gender, and genome) aglow with awe and happiness.
4. “The Whole World Is Watching.” A frighteningly catchy ad jin-
gle for Durban Outfits, a South Africa-based clothing retailer. The ad
is for their new line of videocloth-based clothing, including jackets,
jumpsuits, and pants. Most ads finish on an image of models wearing
the videocloth pants, with a second Durban Outfits ad running on
their backsides.
5. “What Are Parts Without the Whole?” Ad for the upcoming
InVid release Facets (see p. 107). They can be found across Earth and
Mars, and in most medium-sized or larger space stations. The Facets
campaign may be the biggest ad blitz for an InVid ever. Most show
multiple images of a face crashing together and shattering.

cognitive environments by changing important ele-
ments. For memeticists, this means that approaches
and symbols that work in one part of the world may fail
utterly in another. The Area Knowledge skill is useful in
these situations (see p. 117).
Sometimes local variation provides insufficient dis-
tinction for a population unhappy with the state of the
world. A growing number of people are choosing to
cut themselves off entirely from others. One of the
first key steps for those who live on the fringes of
society (largely in space) and those who choose
to be isolated (largely on Earth) is to sever many
of their memetic connections to their past. This
results in a fascinating combination of cultural
museum and cauldron: memes that fit their situation and
are under little pressure to adapt can remain remarkably
stable over decades, even as their mainstream counterparts
evolve to fit changing times. Memes that remain useful but
are under adaptive pressure can, absent external forces
moderating their changes, rapidly churn through succes-
sive variations. Outsiders visiting a well-established Iso-
late community often find surreal mixes of aging ideas,
fashions, and jargon and utterly new, surprising descen-
dants of established mainstream memes.
Firms that specialize in introducing cutting-edge fash-
ions and designs to a system-wide market hungry for inno-
vation can pay very well to get their hands on these new
variant memes. Despite this, most Isolate groups avoid
outside contact. Mainstream memes can be seductive,
especially to those who grew up in the privation of isola-
tion, not having lived through the identity or social crisis
that triggered the move to the fringes. One of the better-
known examples of this was the band “Side of Fries,” a trio
of teens from an Isolate community in Alberta. Brief, sur-
reptitious explorations of the Web gave them fragmentary
samples of a variety of music, which they then combined
and imitated for their own recordings – and, in turn, placed
on the Free Net. Many believe that Side of Fries kicked off
the “Dubcore” music trend of the early 2090s.
Total Information Awareness
One of the fundamental aspects of the mainstream
memetic environment in 2100 is that it is immersed in
information. Nearly all of human knowledge and culture
can be accessed via the Web (for a price) and most people
employ wearable or implanted virtual interfaces allowing
constant access to communication and information net-
works. This is a remarkably competitive environment for
memes, as people still have limited attention that they can
pay to any given idea; for a new meme to grab some of that
scarce attention, it has to stand out – be more innovative,
flashy, and relevant. When memes compete with each
other for attention and access, memetic evolution is the
inevitable result. Those memes that flourish are 
particularly well crafted for their environment.
Viral Ideas
Viral ideas are memes crafted to emphasize propa-
gation, even at the expense of persistence or even stability.
Viral ideas spread quickly and easily, often subverting or
replacing – if only briefly – existing memes. The
adoption of these memes is rarely felt deeply, howev-
er. Most viral ideas are forgotten or replaced in short
order. Viral ideas are particularly powerful in chaotic
memetic environments, where a rumor can rip
through a mob and send it off at a new target.
Gossip
Gossip is the humblest part of a society’s cogni-
tive ecology, yet many memeticists consider it the
most important element. Gossip functions as “soft”
power to guide social behavior, giving everyday peo-
ple a degree of power over elites. The use of gossip as
part of a memetic campaign is a delicate process; the
meme hacker must create a rumor that is plausible,
compelling, and untraceable. If a particular line of
hearsay, especially a false one, is revealed to be plant-
ed, public opinion can very quickly turn against the
source of the engineered story.
Spontaneous Generation
It’s important to recognize that not all memes are
intentional constructions. Many emerge from observa-
tions of the environment or from the intersection of multi-
ple other memes, and propagate due to their compelling,
apparently truthful, or amusing nature. In the era before
memetic science, the vast majority of memes emerged
spontaneously, and even those that were intentionally con-
structed owed their existence more to folk knowledge and
ritual (memetics as alchemy) than to well-understood sci-
entific principles (memetics as chemistry). But even in the
post-PHI age, many memes appear seemingly out of
nowhere, and owe their existence not to carefully designed
memetic campaigns but to the human (and posthuman)
ability to come up with new ideas.
DARWIN AMONG THE MEMES
One of the signature attributes of memes is that they
aren’t static. Memes evolve over time, often over a fairly
short period. In most cases, this change happens in order to
make the meme fit better in various cognitive environ-
ments. In a few cases, the alteration is more deliberate.
Memetic Drift
Contrary to the sometimes gleeful, sometimes horri-
fied predictions of turn-of-the-century pundits, increasing
commerce and communication between Earth’s various
regions did not lead to a single global culture; different cul-
tural regions can and do still have strong local characteris-
tics. Memes and memeplexes often adapt to different

A typical Fourth or Fifth Waver can access tremen-
dous amounts of information and, with the assistance of an
AI, filter it far better than people in decades past. But this
constant access to information also means that blatantly
deceptive or crudely manipulative memes don’t stand a
chance. On Earth, a person is almost never out of reach of
an answer, a critical opinion, or an alternative scenario;
fact checking is remarkably simple (see Reality Check, p.
135). This doesn’t mean that deception and manipulation
are impossible, only that when it is done it is usually done
very well.
One effect of AI assistance is that while selection is
more aggressive, random variation is far less common.
Imperfect human memories are now backed up by far
more accurate machines. While this means that memes
retain higher fidelity during communication, it also means
that happenstance improvements,
where a meme is altered in the
telling because it “sounds better
that way,” are rare.
Filters
Virtual interfaces aren’t
just used to filter out deceptive
memes – they’re also used to
filter out unwelcome images
and opinions. Even the most
basic NAI interface is able to
identify and block web links
and network messages that the
recipient has no desire to see.
Somewhat more sophisticated models can even block
real-world images (and sounds, if the interfaces is
implanted). Rather than seeing a lurid poster or a
screamsheet commentary with retrograde politics, the
person using a filter sees a blank space, or a pleasing
image to let him know that offensive material has been
(virtually) removed (see Filter Software, p. 135). Using
filters to eliminate alternative views is generally dis-
couraged by democratic nations, although the adoption
of filters is common even in the most open societies.
Filters may occasionally be set up to alter outgoing
communications, as well. A filter application called
Scrubber can “clean up” text, voice, and image mes-
sages sent from a virtual interface, removing awkward
or inappropriate elements, making the sender appear
more educated or less offensive than he may actually be.
Ideologically driven movements sometimes install
Scrubber (or similar software) on member interfaces to
make certain that all communications are politically
pure.
Social Filters
Frida looked askance at the grinning bioroid.
“You’ve got to be kidding me. The black lab is a front

The bioroid scoffed. “Everybody knows, sister. Are

“Frida,” said a familiar voice in her head. “I’ve
checked this.”
Out loud: “Just a sec.” Internally: “Go ahead,
Max.”
“Few of your contacts are in a position to know
one way or another, but of those that have heard this
claim, most reject it. However, three – including Reggie
and Mei-Li – say that it fits with other pieces of evi-
dence they’ve seen.”
Frida considered this, and nodded at the bioroid.
“Okay, here’s the deal. You get me into that SIA
lab, I’ll get you the BBF contact link.”

static by nature, and can be too inflexible to cope with

This was not going to be a good day.
A person’s reputation has always been important, and
global information networks make it hard for an individual
to escape the results of his past deeds. But for a small but
influential minority, reputation is something quantified and
evaluated.
Reputation Networks
In many ways reputation – specifically, the honesty
and reliability of an individual – is just another meme to be
passed along and evaluated. As such, memetic filters built
into virtual interfaces can be used to filter on the basis of
reputation. The various computer and software engineers
who built the Web and wearable interfaces implemented
such a system early in the 21st century for their own use.
Derived from primitive reputation systems used by online
games, “friend networks,” and auction sites of the time,
these early reputation networks were crude, with a small
number of settings that would upgrade or downgrade
memetic recommendations as they were passed along. As
the number of people using reputation networks grew,
however, the sheer volume of trusted/mistrusted tags
meant that only those with middle-of-the-road, inoffensive
personalities had positive reputations; the more edgy types
would typically irritate more people than they
impressed, and end up with negative ratings.
cognitive ecology. Moreover, while filters may block
some useless memes, they can’t find good ones. AI
agents are a bit better at the latter task, and are certainly a
step up from simple filtering. A good AI agent can readily
track down useful information on the slimmest guidelines.
But even AIs can be bogged down by the sheer abundance
of material, and be unable to find good new memes as they
are needed.
One solution to the abundance problem is to use
“social filtering,” sometimes called “collaborative fil-
tering.” Rather than accepting or rejecting memes
wholesale, all filtering is contingent upon the source.
High-reliability sources (e.g., friends or colleagues)
are trusted, even when the memes they are suggest-
ing are ones that would be otherwise unwelcome or
ignored; low-reliability sources (e.g., strangers on
the street or InVid “propa-tainment” shows) have to
meet much higher standards when presenting new
memes. In many respects, this is just how ideas have
been propagated for much of human civilization –
people accept new ideas from friends far more read-
ily than they do from strangers. The difference now
is the existence of virtual interfaces.
With the intimate connection of a virtual inter-
face, social filtering can be done passively, in the
background, as the interface’s AI checks with the AIs of
friends and colleagues to gauge how they react to a given
meme. Seconds after a person hears or reads the question-
able meme, he is told by his virtual interface how the peo-
ple he trusts react to it. The main drawback to social
filtering is that an individual’s circle of trusted friends and
colleagues is rarely large enough to be able to respond to
the broad assortment of memes an individual – particular-
ly an adventurer – may encounter. The key to keeping
social filters from going stale is to entertain memes and
evaluations of memes from recommended strangers.

He heard his AI’s voice in his head. “Damn.” That

The first reputation network was clunky and
more distracting than compelling, and was eventually
abandoned. Keeping track of affinity groups required too
much human input, and the software – embedded into
mobile phones, laptops, and the laughably crude wearables
of the era – was too disruptive when employed. Through-
out the subsequent decades, however, the idea kept pop-
ping up. Newer technologies – such as virtual interface
glasses (and then implants), embedded AI assistants, high-
bandwidth wireless networks, and reliable face-recogni-
tion software – gave new life and feasibility to the notion
of a reputation management network.
By the 2070s, the pieces were all in
place. A cacophony of mutually incom-
patible reputation networks popped up,
each experimenting with different varia-
tions of the concept. By 2083, the Working
Group on Social Network Technology had
drafted a standardized reputation signaling proto-
col, which was sent for approval to a variety of interna-
tional organizations. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the
Pacific War meant that few people had the time to study
the proposal, and fewer companies were interested in
introducing new software. Finally, in 2088, the protocol
was approved and reputation management applications
appeared all over the Web.
While each program has its own unique features, all
reputation managers work in the same way. Rather than
treat all trust ratings as more or less equivalent, the system
gives much greater weight to those from an individual’s
circle of friends – the more the user trusts someone, the
more that user can trust the people his friend trusts. 
It also allows for self-defined affinity groups and 
filtering of ratings on the basis of trust
between groups. As a result, it is possi-
ble to see not just whether a given person is
trusted, but by which groups, and to see who
trusts or mistrusts them. When encountering
a new meme, it soon becomes second nature
for those using reputation networks to
quickly check the source. Who trusts this
person or company, and who doesn’t?
Reputation

designed to be difficult to trick. Repeated
entries, “logrolling” (where two or more
people give each other positive entries as
often as possible), mass “hate” campaigns
(especially against public figures and politi-
cians), and the like can be identified and
dropped from reputation evaluations.
Nonetheless, there is a cottage industry of
hackers offering to boost reputation ratings
artificially; few of these attempts work, at
least for very long.
Reputation Societies
As of 2100, a small but growing minor-
ity of people in Europe, the PRA, and the
United States rely on reputation networks to
better evaluate new memes and the people or
organizations passing them along. India and the South
African Coalition are also starting to see reputation net-
works; China, the Islamic Caliphate, and the TSA have
few participants. Such networks are surprisingly rare on
Mars, but common on Islandia and other large orbital
habitats. The smaller communities in Earth’s orbit and
beyond tend not to have enough people to require
AI-supported reputation management, although
some are beginning to adopt reputation networks
in order to have a better sense of strangers that
come to visit.
Some communities may also use reputation
networks as a way of managing business transac-
tions, political affiliations, and even personal rela-
tionships. Areas that are  trying the reputation society
approach are generally Fifth Wave and population-dense,
and always heavily networked. Notable locations with
widespread participation in experimental reputation soci-
eties include San Francisco, Tokyo, Singapore, Amster-
dam, and Cape Town. While not everyone participates,
enough people are active in the reputation networks to
make the system work. The success breeds more partici-
pation, in turn, as people who haven’t been active join in
just to see how others view them. Those who participate
in reputation network communities must run appropriate
software (see Reputation Management Software, p. 136).
An individual may have reputation marks from dozens of
different sources; there isn’t a single “reputation
score.”

libel and slander charges
filed against reputation net-
works themselves, none have
been successful; reputation
systems scrupulously avoid
material comments, offering
only a mechanism for what
amounts to entirely legal “I
like him” and “I don’t like
him” entries.
When viewing their own repu-
tation ratings, most people choose to first
look at the rating given by their chosen affinity group,
then at the ratings given by various socially influential
groups – the police, for example, or a locally dominant
corporation. Most reputation management programs
allow a person to see key elements leading to a particular
score, including who gave various ratings; some reputa-
tion networks choose to keep that information anony-
mous. Even in those situations, however, the time and
date of changes in reputation ratings are visible, and can
be correlated to personal memory – or, more likely, an
AI’s memory – of events at that point.
The vast majority of people in reputation societies
have neutral or mildly positive ratings across the majority
of affinity groups, although they may be highly rated
within their own circle of friends. Few people are so self-
less or so cruel as to generate relentlessly positive or neg-
ative reactions from those they encounter. People with
higher ratings tend to be treated better, on the presumption
that they will continue to behave well; those with negative
ratings (especially below -50) are shunned, on the pre-
sumption that they must have done something awful to
earn such a score. 
Life in a Reputation Network
Most reputation networks use a generalized posi-
tive/negative axis for ratings, which range from -100 to
+100. Behavior that people like typically generates posi-
tive points, often referred to as “bumps”; doing something
that people don’t like results in negative points, or
“dumps.” Generate enough bumps or dumps from people
one interacts with, and the reputation ratings with those
various groups reflect the change. An individual on a rep-
utation network wishing to give a bump or dump to some-
one else on the network has to make certain that the target
has been identified by his virtual interface, then give the
appropriate comment, which results in a base +1 or -1
adjustment to the target’s reputation rating.
However, not everyone sees the rating the same way.
How other people react to the positive and negative
changes depends on how much or how little they trust the
person giving the rating. A rating from someone with a
very high reputation in a particular group has a far greater
impact – perhaps as much as double – than one from a
person with a low to middling reputation, which is typi-
cally translated into a fractional shift. A rating from some-
one with a negative reputation may be ignored
completely, or even provoke a reverse reaction. Users are
generally notified if they receive a significant positive or
negative change to their reputation.
In order to prevent abuse, participants on reputation
networks have a limited pool of bumps and dumps
they can use. In standard networks, individuals
have 10 points of rating available to use as they
see fit. As those rating points are used, they
recover at a pace of one point per 24-hour period.
In this way, people who are careful with their rat-
ing points always have some available to respond
to especially good or bad behavior. Spending this
“reputation capital” on behalf of someone else is
discouraged (a person really should know who he
is giving a bump or dump to), and doing so for
profit, if discovered, usually results in negative
ratings across the board.
Newcomers to a reputation community are
usually granted a zero rating; sometimes AIs
scour information networks to find pertinent data
about the individual in order to give a more
appropriate initial score. Because of this, accusa-
tions of libel and slander are increasingly com-
monplace, as a negative remark on a memenet or
insulting joke in a slink log can potentially affect
a reputation evaluation. Although there have been

By and large, reputation network ratings and a charac-
ter’s Reputation map fairly well. Each positive or negative
25 points of a reputation rating is the equivalent of a +1 or
-1 modifier to the reaction roll. The vast majority of affini-
ty groups are a “small class of people” for calculating the
point cost of the Reputation. (A typical person active in a
reputation society will likely find his reputation rating fluc-
tuating wildly among the various groups; at the GM’s dis-
cretion, the point costs for reputation modifiers may be
ignored.) The main difference between life in a reputation
network and a standard Reputation is that in areas adopting
the reputation society model, the frequency of recognition is
“all the time,” as other people’s virtual interfaces try to iden-
tify everyone that they encounter.

The man known only as “Voice” stood in front of
the group, wearing a simple shirt and loose trousers. As
he spoke, his audience sometimes laughed or applaud-

rhythmic, hypnotic, pulling you in even if you had no
idea what he was talking about. I smiled and laughed
along with them, but it was an act. I had taken a tab of
Flatline earlier – he wasn’t going to affect me, no mat-

affecting Daniel, who sat at the front of the audience

and it would be my only chance to see him alone.
It took me a moment to get to the utility room,
but there he was, feeding the day’s trash to the

I quickly walked up to him.
“Good evening, sister Yolanda. How can –” I hit
him with a Flatline patch, right on the neck, and he
stumbled back, his body twitching as the brainbug did
its work. I helped him sit.
“Daniel . . . can you hear me?” I held his face,
forcing him to look at me.
“Yolanda . . . Yoli . . . what’s going on?” His voice
was weak, but for the first time in weeks, his eyes were
clear. As the drug kicked in, his memories of the past
month flooded back, and a wave of nausea struck him.
“C’mon, Daniel, we have to go. Now.” I pulled him
up, and turned toward the door.

ultrapotent being. Rather than an all-powerful
anthropomorphic entity, however, they believe that
this being is actually comprised of what physicists
call the dark matter and dark energy that lies
between the stars. They further claim that this
aspect of the universe cannot be fully understood by
those who see things only in a scientific or spiritual
light. The Dark was created by, and also created, the Big
Bang that gave the universe life.
Persistent memeplexes often act as catalysts to
turn belief into action. In order to thrive and spread,
complex sets of memes usually include evangelistic com-
ponents. It’s not enough to simply accept a set of ideas – a
believer must actively attempt to convince others their
ideas are truth. There’s Darwinian logic to this – meme-
plexes without this strong evangelism are less likely to
propagate and survive.
In the past, the relative isolation of some communities
meant that sophisticated but less-assertive memes had a
chance to flower. Conversion doesn’t need to be high on
the agenda if believers rarely contact people of other faiths.
As changes in technology made it possible for disparate
groups to communicate over wide areas, many less-
aggressive memeplexes withered under the onslaught of
belief systems dedicated to widespread evangelism.
In a memetic context, evangelism does not necessari-
ly imply religion. Although convictions of faith often pro-
duce the memetic systems best to aggressively proselytize,
many nonreligious political and social movements trigger
such a desire too. Many memeticists in 2100 classify reli-
gious cults and political factions as more or less the same
phenomenon. Indeed, plenty of groups have qualities of
both, pressing for political and social change with religious
conviction.
CULTS
To the chagrin of those who equate
scientific advancement with secularism,
the end of the 21st century is a golden age
of religions. Despite the growing might of
civilization, humanity’s sense of self has never
been more fragile. More people than ever seek to under-
stand their place in the world. The onrushing transforma-
tion leads many to question mankind’s nature, and they
often find the answers disturbing. Billions remain faithful
to long-established religions and philosophies, particularly
those practices that have reinvented themselves for the
new era. A substantial minority, however, have come to
believe that traditional beliefs provide feeble solace for
those seeking peace and self-knowledge in this age. They
have instead turned to alternative practices and cults.
With the rising demand has come rising supply, and
the modern era’s tools have accelerated the process of
starting a new belief system. Sophisticated memetic-
engineering techniques give cults the ability to create com-
pelling and seductive philosophies, while nanodrugs can
make true believers out of the most hardened skeptics. But
many of the most popular cults disdain the use of these
crutches; they believe in their messages’ power and their
devotion to revealed truth. In a world where the future is
utterly uncertain and even reality is considered contingent,
this is often enough.

CULTS AND RELIGIONS
A cult is often said to be merely a religion without
mainstream approval . . . an argument with some truth.
Many minority religions are referred to as cults simply
because some authority has decided they are danger-
ous, subversive, or somehow repugnant to “good
moral order.” Theologians also use “cult” to
refer to deviant religious groups with non-
mainstream practices. This is in contrast to
sect, which refers to deviant religious groups
with more traditional practices.
Memetic scientists, however, distinguish
between cults and religions by considering
where each group focuses its attention. In reli-
gions the rules, values, and ritual dominate. In
cults, the leadership dominates. If a cult loses
its leader, it likely faces splits, power strug-
gles, or even rapid collapse. In this model,
cults can become religions over time, if the
memeplex evolves to a more structured and
less charismatic format.

The cult came to limited popularity after the
2091 recovery of the Shezbeth object. Eldern Maicho,
a Duncanite mystic and astrophysicist, set down the
beliefs of the Acolytes. Chief among these is the conclu-
sion that primordial black holes are the key to under-
standing dark matter, as they are whole universes unto
themselves and offspring of the cosmic creator. Mankind
has been given the chance to prove itself by governing
these universes as dark matter and energy governs this
one. Only by ruling them with wisdom and intelligence
can humanity be elevated to be one with the Dark.
Acolytes are, almost without exception, dwellers in
deep space with no Earthly ties or alle-
giances. Most are Red Duncanites and
Gypsy Angels; as of the beginning of
2100, there are about a thousand
Acolytes in the outer system. Maicho’s
sermons are fairly persuasive; those
who join the Acolytes do so out of belief
rather than coercion.
For the Acolytes, finding and
recovering a primordial black hole is a
modern quest for the Holy Grail. They
believe black holes found by others
should be made available for all to study
and worship – since traditional scien-
tists of Sol, by denying all matters spir-
itual, certainly wouldn’t be able to
understand them fully. Acolytes have
begun serious efforts at recover-
ing their own black hole so
that it may be properly understood and guid-
ed, allowing them to reach cosmic transcen-
dence.
Throughout the system Acolytes scan the
Kuiper Belt, hoping to find a black hole near
enough to grab before corrupt Earthly corpo-
rations can steal them. To make this possible,
Maicho cut a deal with Vim Raymond, a Tro-
jan Mafia boss, to secretly assemble a small
fleet ready to intercept any other primordial
black holes discovered by nonbelievers. In
exchange for this assistance, Acolytes will
provide technical assistance and, once the
order has its hands on its first primordial
black hole, help Raymond’s group get its
own primordial black hole. Maicho is aware
that Raymond intends to somehow use the
primordial black hole as a weapon against his
enemies, but is willing to make that
exchange. The Acolytes believe that they
have the right and responsibility to puzzle the
secrets of these microverses. The possible
death of thousands is nothing weighed
against true understanding of the living
Dark.
Ecoherence
We all surf the seas of chaos, but too many of us
fall in. 
– Maria Turner,
Ecological Coherence, 2079
Ecoherence started in 2068, but truly took off after the
publication of LOGOS’ Propagation of Human Ideas.
Founder Maria Turner, a brilliant student of philosophy
and psychology, had begun constructing a new religion
better able to cope with the changing definition of
humankind. PHI
crystallized
many of her ideas, and she
reshaped 
her 
emerging
philosophies to reflect the new
understanding of how beliefs
emerge and spread. That Eco-
herence is a constructed reli-
gion is not denied by the
organization and is not consid-
ered particularly scandalous.
Many supporters feel that the
crafted nature of Ecoherence
is one of its strengths. Turner
herself claims that only
philosophies created in accor-
dance with understanding of
the actual functions of the
human mind have any rele-
vance to real human needs or
aspirations.
Few followers know the degree to which Ecoherence
is designed to bring in and retain believers. From the out-
set, Turner built philosophies and organizational structures
to create self-reinforcing cycles of dependency. Every
aspect of Ecoherence is intended to make believers feel
special, protected, and under relentless attack from the out-
side. Many anti-Ecoherence “hit pieces” on the Web were
actually created by Turner or her associates as part of an
elaborate campaign to inculcate a sense of oppression in
her followers. 
Ecoherence initially saw remarkable growth, as Turn-
er was quickly able to turn LOGOS’ academic prose into
usable techniques. By 2084, over 300,000 people around
the world participated in Ecoherence meetings, online or in
person. This period of growth tapered off over the 2080s,
as populations developed memetic antibodies to the PHI-
derived techniques. By that time, however, Ecoherence
had developed enough of a following and legitimacy that
it had cognitive critical mass, and could grow without rely-
ing on what critics referred to as “memetic tricks.” This
doesn’t mean that Ecoherence leadership no longer uses
memetic techniques – quite the opposite. The organiza-
tion’s inner circle is on the cutting edge of memetic 
development.

one of the movement’s slogans. As
members 
demonstrate 
their

greater authority. Moving up

become one of the larger
holders

achieve
“Whisper” status, a mid-level rank-

attempts at self-ordering are fruit-

Ecoherence owns over a dozen
such scanners, and “Structuring
Facilities” housing the devices are
in major cities in North American
and Europe. Members are asked to
pay handsomely for the scan,
which nearly all do eagerly.
Rumors persist that these HyMRI
scans are used to alter member
beliefs and behaviors, a claim that
Ecoherence denies.
Ecoherence’s critics claim that
the organization is little more than
a con game designed to separate
the gullible from their property.
The movement’s public response is
to ignore such statements; secretly,
Ecoherence has an entire branch of its structure dedicat-
ed to countering memetic actions criticizing the move-
ment. This usually means conducting campaigns to
discredit or otherwise stain critics’ reputations, although
the secret memetic branch itself has a classified division
for executing more direct and even violent actions
against those who try to harm the movement. Only Turn-
er can authorize this sort of activity. However, in recent
years she has become increasingly volatile, responding
with fury to any criticism of the organization or her 
leadership of it.
Kwangbok
I wonder, now, how people can willingly leave the
breast of our world. I know that I am too enraptured by
the soil of my home to ever want to leave. It is a part of
me, within me, giving me spirit and solace, faith in the
future and hope for the past. My home is my religion.
– Yong-nam Hong,
With Open Arms, 2092
By the late 2090s, Ecoherence claimed over two mil-
lion followers throughout the solar system, most in the
United States and Europe. As the organization has grown,
its recruitment practices have evolved. Ecoherence no
longer focuses its direct attention on everyday people,
instead concentrating its efforts on “social nodes” – influ-
ential individuals who affect the decisions of others,
often without conscious realization. Ecoherence employs
hundreds of memetic specialists – a variant of Edge-
hunters (see p. 131) called “memetologists” by Ecoher-
ence – to seek out, identify, and contact these social
nodes: trendsetters, political influencers, cultural arbiters,
etc. As a result, Ecoherence enjoys a generally positive
reputation, and some of its jargon is slipping into wider
use (see above). 
The Ecoherence canon itself is a minimal-impact
environmentalist doctrine coupled with strict hierarchies
of power. Disorder is a sign of weakness. The philosophy
asserts that people should avoid engaging in behavior
that has too many unpredictable results; “complexity

ECOHERENCE JARGON
Language used by the Ecoherence movement is showing up in
everyday conversations of the English-speaking world. While this does
not mean that everyone using these terms is an Ecoherence follower, it
does reflect the growing influence the movement has in many Fourth and
Fifth Wave nations.
alignment: An individual’s mental or emotional state. Alignments
are usually “cohesive,” “jumbled,” or, worst of all, “chaotic.”
brownian: Life lived without any attempt to bring coherence – not
just random, stupidly random.
friction: Chaos resulting from interaction between two poorly struc-
tured individuals. The term implies that the problems result from unin-
tended but avoidable problems and has a disdainful undertone.
full silence: Ecoherence’s highest level achievable by general mem-
bers. Used commonly to mean overly strict or dominating. This is sup-
posed to be one of the movement’s secret terms, so Ecoherence’s
memetic engineers are working to eliminate its general use.
irrational-sum: Similar to “zero-sum” and “positive/negative-sum”
in reference to interactions, “irrational-sum” describes dealings where all
parties are focused on finding every last bit of advantage. In Ecoherence,
this is a sign of an “unstructured” life.
niche: Used as a verb meaning “to put into a proper location.” In
popular usage, has an implication that, once “niched,” something can be
forgotten.
phase shift: In Ecoherence, the process of moving to increasingly or
decreasingly ordered states of existence. In general usage, it means a
large and sudden change in life.
statics: Those who do not follow Ecoherence. Generally, those who
serve largely to impede an individual’s progress and contribute little or
nothing to his or her life.

Kwangbok, or “liberation,” first appeared in northern
Korea in early 2093. Its leader, Yong-nam Hong, took
great pains to link its precepts to traditional folk religions
in his various public appearances, and the Korean authori-
ties paid little attention to the growing popularity of the
practice. In recent months, however, the Korean govern-
ment has begun to look much more closely.
According to his official biography, Yong-nam Hong
was born in 2025, shortly after the peaceful reunification
of North and South Korea. While his family struggled dur-
ing the rebuilding of the northern economy, Yong-nam was
drawn into a local religious movement known as Chondo-
gyo. He spent several decades as a minister of the faith,
traveling the countryside offering services and support for
the local townspeople. When the religion suffered an inter-
nal power struggle and schism in 2071, Yong-nam Hong
had a crisis of faith and left the church. He wandered
throughout East and Southeast Asia over the course of the
next decade, looking for inspiration.
What he found was conflict. He was in Laos at the
outset of the Pacific War, and came very close to being
killed by a Chinese attack on a hospital where he was
working. (China claimed that the hospital was actually a
bioweapons test facility.) He spent months in Laos recu-
perating, then traveled slowly through southern and east-
ern China, eventually returning home in 2091. Hong spent
the next year writing down his experiences and thoughts
about his travels and homecoming, eventually 
publishing a book called With Open Arms.
He used this book as a way of connecting with
other Koreans who felt lost in the modern era. Kwang-
bok emerged as the unifying element for these disaffected
citizens, as Hong combined traditional folk beliefs, the
sense of service and spirituality from Chondogyo, and a
“nationalism of the soil” that reinforced Korean pride as a
people. The faith also was openly disdainful toward the
large southern Korean corporations that dominated life in
the north.
While this disdain initially manifested as calls for
more jobs for northern Koreans, over the last few years it
has taken on a decidedly infosocialist tint. Hong and his
various deacons are vocal in their opposition to corporate
control of ideas and information. Members of the cult have
engaged in peaceful protests at the headquarters of Korean
entertainment and software companies. They also commit
other acts of civil disobedience. In February of 2099, in the
midst of a harsh northern winter, 20 Kwangbok members
staged a “sing-in” at the Pyongyang city center, protesting
the use of a folk melody as the basis of a new and content-
rights-managed pop song.
The Korean government has begun to investigate
whether Kwangbok is somehow influenced or controlled
by the TSA. News reports calling Kwangbok a “dangerous
cult” are more frequent, and members of the religion fear
infiltration by provocateurs or even arrest. Now almost 75,
Yong-nam Hong is as forceful as ever in his speech and
belief, and promises that he “will not capitulate to a gov-
ernment controlled by greed.”
Mahamba
We face nothing less than the agents of the devil
come to play in the deepest aspects of our being. They
have come to deface the gifts to us given by our father
in the sky and our mother in the soil. If we accept that,
we are worse than dead – we are no longer human. We
would be nothing more than lies given flesh.
– Jonas Kilundu,
Proceedings of the Spirit, Volume 2, 2095
In 2062, Professor Marcus Kilundu of the University
of Pretoria took a leave of absence following the death of
his wife. During his year of mourning, Kilundu had a spir-
itual awakening, finding solace and meaning in the tradi-
tional practices of the region. He wrote about his religious
epiphany in his 2064 book, The People of the Clay. While
never a best seller, it provided inspiration to thousands of
people in Africa, and Kilundu collected a growing set of
followers. In 2070, he retired from the university, opening
up the Sarai Kilundu Institute in Luanda, Angola. The cen-
ter was dedicated to the teaching of traditional religious
rites and philosophies.
By the early 2080s, Kilundu and his closest staff had
shifted the teachings from traditional beliefs to a syncretic
practice they called “Mahamba.” Mixing in elements
of a variety of regional traditions, Mahamba

including Sufis, have attempted this in the past.
However, Mathirism’s unique feature is that the tech-
niques used to create and maintain these mental states are
all based on intensive use of virtual-reality systems and
slink recordings. A typical Mathirite recording is usually
abstract or surreal; the devotee spends considerable
amounts of time immersed in full sensory playback, either
playing a very long recording or repeating a short sequence
in a continuous loop. The result is a hallucinatory state
comparable to the effects of powerful drugs.
Mathirites claim that this technique is more power-
ful and more controlled than conventional trance-
inducing techniques such as drug use, whirling dances,
chanting, meditation, or fasting. Critics from older tra-
ditions claim that the experiences’ artificial nature
makes them sterile and ineffective as a path to higher
consciousness. One common concern about Mathirite
techniques is that the cult leaders and teachers effec-
tively control the recordings’ creation, potentially mak-
ing them ineffective or a form of brainwashing.
It is important to note that Mathirism is not related
to Cybergnosticism or Hyperevolutionism. Indeed,
Jamal Mathir and his personal pupils are fiercely criti-
cal of both those beliefs. Mathirites do not believe that
God is “pure information” or that humanity should seek
“digital perfection.” They believe in an entirely tran-
scendent deity, one who cannot be understood by any-
thing as rational as scientific analysis and who draws
no moral distinctions between flesh and data. Mathirite
technological meditation serves one purpose alone: to
detach the believer from rationalist conceptions and
restraints, freeing the perceptions and soul to seek a
higher state. Indeed, Mathirites delight in logical and
mathematical paradoxes, fractal images, and serendipi-
tous computer failures, seeing them as marking flaws in
normal perceptions of the universe.

ty. Its basic approach combined environmentalist and
Preservationist ideals with appeals to a mythic history of
the African spirit. Its rise corresponded to the growing
political influence of biotechnology in the Southern
African Coalition.
Marcus Kilundu died in 2092. His son, Jonas, now
heads the Institute. Under Jonas Kilundu, Mahamba has
become more political, criticizing SAC leadership for its
willingness to allow extreme biotechnologies to be used on
Africans. In 2098, after Kilundu
endorsed a presidential candidate
from the African Natural Traditions
party – a fairly radical Preservationist
faction – the SAC executive council
launched an investigation of Maham-
ba and its adherents. Kilundu com-
plained of “official persecution,” a
claim that the SAC calls “sheer 
paranoia.”
About 20,000 people in southern
and southwestern Africa follow
Mahamba, most in Angola. Over 250
followers live in or near the Institute
itself. Most have research or support
duties in the Institute, but a 2099
investigation by the SAC Special
Police Services uncovered evidence
that some members were being initiat-
ed into traditional African warrior societies and given mil-
itary-style training. In August of 2099, Kilundu announced
that the Institute would be moving to an isolated part of
Angola, near the southern town of Menongue, in order to
pursue their religious observances without official 
harassment.

Mathirism is a belief system founded by the
Frenchman Jamal Mathir in the 2080s. It some-
times claims to be a Sufi order. Although most
conventional Sufis dispute this, sometimes
fiercely, the claim has some logic to it.
Because of its Sufi connection, Mathirism is
prohibited in more-conservative parts of the
Islamic Caliphate, and informally oppressed in
many more. Its largest body of followers is in
Europe, although it has converts worldwide.
The defining feature of Mathirism is an attempt to
achieve nonrational insights into the divine, possibly even
direct communion with God, by means of altered 
states of consciousness. Countless sects and cults,

Mathirites believe in an entirely 
transcendent deity, one who cannot be
understood by anything as rational as 
scientific analysis and who draws no moral
distinction between flesh and data. Their
technological meditation serves one 
purpose: to detach the believer from 
rationalist conceptions and constraints.

Mathirite ethics are generally flexible, although
the cult dislikes the use of drugs and other mind-
affecting indulgences as a distraction from its own path.
They also regard the physical world as irrelevant when
compared to communion with the godhead. It is monothe-
istic, sharing the Islamic and Christian belief in a single
supreme being, but its taste for paradoxes and the irrational
is similar to Zen Buddhism. Most Mathirites have a vague-
ly conventional morality, and are law-abiding. Their dis-
dain for material distractions saves them from many
temptations, but they can seem smug and arrogant.
Mathirism appeals to individuals seeking spiritual guid-
ance and insights, especially those who lack any special
obsession with “ancient wisdom” or who have a particular
fondness for technology. It does not proselytize very
aggressively, and rarely makes converts except from
among those with some prior interest in its techniques.
Presleyan Heresy
Marx said that history happens twice – first as
tragedy, then as farce. But every now and then, the
reverse is true.
– Dina Holland, Hail To The King, Baby,
2088
Elvis Presley was a popular musician in the mid- to
late 20th century. Although he died a somewhat tawdry
death, he continued to have fans well into the early 21st
century, particularly in the United States. As his older
admirers died off, however, Presley began the slow decline
into historical obscurity, showing up in musical retrospec-
tives but by 2025 rarely anywhere else.
Leroy “Mudfoot” White changed that.
Leroy White was a blues musician living in Oxford,
Mississippi. Well into his 90s, White was still charismatic,
and could draw a crowd with his grav-
elly voice. Even after he was diag-
nosed with cancer and his body
began to fail, White would sit on
the porch of his home, singing
Elvis Presley songs. He claimed
that his father had been one of
Elvis’ early mentors, and that he
learned many of these songs from
Elvis himself. 
On the morning of July 1,
2031, White was found running
through the streets of Oxford, his
cancer in full remission. To a rap-
idly growing crowd, White pro-
claimed that the music of Elvis
Presley had healed him.
Over the subsequent decade,
White gathered together several
dozen more elderly men and
women, nearly all of them musical
performers, who claimed to have been healed by the
music of Elvis. While most journalists treated the
group as a joke, making references to “the Church of
Elvis,” meetings of the group grew ever larger . . . family,
friends, and spectators joined in. The revival assemblies
were lively and filled with music. White’s eventual funer-
al, in 2040, drew nearly 10,000 attendees.
In 2043, one of the core group’s younger members, a
52-year-old retired schoolteacher named Jenna Jackson,
wrote a slim volume called Elvis and the King of Kings.
She pulled together the personal stories of those who
claimed to have been touched by the spirit of Elvis, con-
ventional maxims and admonishments about living a good
life, and a superficially evangelical view of Christianity.
Humorous and inspirational, the book sold well, drawing
more people into the circle of Elvis-followers, who began
to call themselves “Sons and Daughters of the King,” often
abbreviated SDK.
Religious conservatives would have none of it, how-
ever – throughout the 2040s and 2050s, ministers across
many traditional denominations decried the “Presleyan
Heresy” as idolatry. Nonetheless, the SDK movement
continued to grow. By the 2060 census, nearly 250,000
people in the U.S. claimed to be SDK members. In a
world of incipient Cybergnosticism and Transhumanist
philosophies, followers of Elvis seemed almost quaintly
conventional.
In 2078, with nearly 500,000 adherents, the Sons and
Daughters of the King saw their first real trouble. The
movement’s leader, Howard Plettner – derisively called
“The Colonel” by his critics, inside and outside of the
movement – ordered that all images of Elvis used by the
church be from his early years. Images of the older Elvis
were removed from all SDK documents, buildings, and
websites. Some congregations protested, claiming that the

CULTS AROUND THE WORLD
Nearly every society on and off Earth has a variety of small, nontra-
ditional religions and cults. The vast majority of these groups are peaceful
and fairly quiet, with limited proselytizing and fund-raising activities. The
United States, Brazil, and Mexico are home to quite a few alternative reli-
gious movements, and Japan has been a hotbed of cult activity for over a
century. Nontraditional religions of any sort are largely illegal in the Islam-
ic Caliphate and are highly discouraged in the Transpacific Socialist
Alliance. The Chinese government occasionally cracks down on cults it
deems disruptive to society, although in 2100 Beijing is in a somewhat lib-
eral mood regarding alternative religions – the exception being the Unified
Way (see p. 28). Freedom of religion is enshrined in both the U.S. and E.U.
constitutions, although in regions where traditional religious practices are
commonplace, cults are under substantial social pressure to remain hidden
and quiet.

into its massive global consciousness. Most support-
ers of the singularity concept figured that this event
would happen no later than 2050.
Unfortunately for them, that wasn’t
how history turned out. Sapient artificial
intelligence proved to be far more dif-
ficult than many people expected.
As of 2100, a progression much
past a human level of intelli-
gence is effectively impossible.
By the 2040s, most sup-
porters of the singularity idea
either gave up on it entirely or
recast it as a “someday” con-
cept worthy of interesting
discussion but not much
else. Not all of them gave
up, however. A fraction of
the hardcore singularity
proponents – many of
whom had for decades
called themselves “singu-
laritans” – refused to give
up. Most argued that such a
transcendent breakthrough
remained well within possibil-
ity and once the “wall of limit-
ed cognition” had been broken,
the power of modern computing
technology meant that the singular-
ity transition would happen faster
than previously estimated. A small
number of remaining singularitans even
argued that the singularity had occurred, but
that the newly godlike AI had determined that
humanity would not have been able to comprehend this
degree of change. It therefore graciously gave human civ-
ilization, uploaded right on schedule, a false history to fol-
low in their new virtual-reality lives.
Each successive year without the end of the world
did little to dampen the ardor of hardcore singularitans. It
was a matter of faith. In 2070, after it was clear that the
invention of fully sapient AIs was not leading to tran-
scendent transformation, a series of articles and docu-
mentaries about determined singularitans referred to the
believers as a “cult.” In response, the singularitans’ gen-
erally acknowledged leader, Adam Stein, attempted to
register Singularitanism as a religion with the U.S. gov-
ernment. He argued that it had articles of faith (the immi-
nent appearance of super-sapient AI), ancient holy books
(a series of turn-of-the-century treatises by eminent com-
puter scientists), key behavioral values (don’t do any-
thing to risk dying before the singularity), and a fully
fleshed-out “end times” revelation (upload and tran-
scend). To everyone’s surprise, especially Stein’s, Sin-
gularitanism was granted church status.
Elder Elvis personified the sorrows and sins of the
world, while the Young Elvis was simply an innocent.
What started as an aesthetic conflict became a
doctrinal struggle, then turned violent. Plet-
tner was shot and killed in 2081. Appar-
ently in retaliation, the headquarters of
the Elder Elvis schism was burned to
the ground by an unknown arsonist.
The leadership in both factions
became increasingly radical. In
2100, they still launch verbal
and virtual tirades against
each other. Each has lodged
trademark violation com-
plaints against the other with
the WTO, claiming in-
fringement of ownership of
the image of Elvis.
The Sons and Daugh-
ters of the King (the
Younger) are headquartered
in Memphis. A
distant
descendant of Elvis has
become close to the group,
and in 2094 the Younger fac-
tion base moved into Grace-
land. The current leader, Kevin
Robert Barber, is known to have
a bad temper and a fondness for
brainbugs. He employs a small
contingent of armed guards, all cos-
metically sculpted to look like Elvis. 
The Sons and Daughters of the King
(the Elder) are headquartered in Las Vegas,
Nevada, in a smallish casino off the Strip. Mem-
bers can be found throughout the United States. Rumors on
the Web claim that the Elder faction is working with a
gray-market AI programming team to construct an eidolon
of Elvis. One rumor goes on to claim that they’ve been 
partially successful, but the eidolons soon become 
psychotic.

At the end of the 20th century, many forward-looking

moment of change was imminent. They called this change
the “singularity,” and said that it would be triggered by the
development of sapient artificial intelligence – which they
saw as happening as soon as 2010 or 2020. In the singu-
larity paradigm, the moment the first “true” AI woke up, it
would embark on a series of self-upgrades, each faster than
the last, eventually becoming such an utterly transcen-
dent figure that it would sweep up all of humankind

But what started as a sarcastic joke took on a life
of its own. Registering as a church prompted a great
deal of attention, and actually led to a sharp rise in num-
bers of devotees. Most of those who joined up were
younger technologists who had been born long after the
first wave of singularity enthusiasm had petered out. Many
actually worked on modern artificial intelligence design,
and saw in the singularitan paradigm a reason for excite-
ment about their chosen profession.
Singularitan meetings through the 2080s and into the
2090s adopted tongue-in-cheek religious trappings –
including sermons, singing, and appeals to “Kurzweil” to
watch over everyone – but for a growing number of believ-
ers, these elements have become real symbols. In 2098, a
survey of those who claimed to belong to a Singularitan
church, approximately 50,000 people, found that over half
claimed to be serious. Adam Stein continues to attempt to
make people aware that Singularitanism wasn’t meant to
be a real religion . . . although it now appears he may be
too late.
Spanda Bindu
Information socialism is a corrupt faith invented by
an atheist and embraced by Muslims, Catholics, and,
worst of all, Europeans. How can a true Hindu feel
anything but hatred for it?
– Rama Veda, 2099
In 2040, near the disputed Kashmir region along
the India-Pakistan border, a young man calling himself
Rama Veda drew the notice of local authorities with his
seductive oratory and religious fervor. Preaching a philos-
ophy that melded Hindu nationalism and Yoga meditation
techniques, Rama Veda made Indian officials nervous.
However, he carefully avoided promoting violence against
the region’s Muslims, so Indian authorities let him be. He
called his approach Spanda Bindu, or “spontaneous con-
centration,” and he told his followers that a greater Hin-
dustan could be theirs given sufficient focus and
meditation.
By March of 2043, the Spanda Bindu movement had
several thousand adherents and was starting to gain a fol-
lowing throughout the country. In April of 2043, Rama Veda
was shot in the head and killed, allegedly by a member of a
rival Hindu nationalist group jealous of his growing influ-
ence. Although others attempted to pick up the Spanda
Bindu banner, by 2045 the movement had faded away.
In 2094, a group of yogis in Srinagar announced that
they had preserved tissues from the assassinated Rama
Veda – and had, in 2082, cloned him. In and of itself, this
was not a startling announcement – once human cloning
had been perfected, religious groups seeking to regain
lost leaders were eager to employ the technique. But the
Spanda Bindu yogis went a step further with their
announcement, claiming that Rama Veda himself had
reincarnated in the flesh of his clone, and had full mem-
ories of his past life. 
This claim was met with widespread dismissal, but
over the subsequent months, reports emerged of the young
Rama Veda correctly identifying personal items and peo-
ple not widely known to have been part of the previous
Rama Veda’s life. Moreover, a succession of locals who
had personally known Rama Veda stated that after meeting
with the young clone they were convinced that it was
indeed the same individual. Skeptics continued to dismiss
the claims. The editor of the Srinagar newsfeed even wrote
that he believed that the new Rama Veda was a bioshell
running an eidolon infomorph. He was found dead within
a week of making his comments, a warning to others who
might insult Rama Veda. Throughout 2095 and 2096, a
growing number of Hindus were listening to what the
young prophet had to say.
Regardless of the veracity of his claims, it was clear
that the Rama Veda clone had all of the charisma of the
original. By late 2098, the resurgent Spanda Bindu move-
ment had attracted over a 100,000 followers across India,
and was the subject of several celebratory InVid programs.
The Spanda Bindu philosophy still promotes Hindu
nationalism, but now, with Hindu nationalists in power and
old rival Pakistan weakened, the movement now has an
increasingly antinanosocialist tenor. As Rama Veda
focused his speeches on fighting the influence of the TSA,
India’s ruling party, the Indian National Alliance, began
to openly support Spanda Bindu.

By that time, however, Teca groups had
appeared in six cities in Mexico and the southwestern
United States. Original cult members who had escaped the
Texas raid had started all the new groups. In some
cases, a couple of the originals remained with the
new groups – more often, the originals started
the new group and moved on, letting the local
cult grow on its own. All of the cult groups
behaved in similar fashions, and there was
very little deviance between the various
branches. In every case, the recruits were young
and from relatively well-off families. Some were
employed in technical fields, but most were simply
wealthy Eloi. The Santa Fe Gazette reflected popular sen-
timent with its headline over the picture of a captured
cultist – reading, simply, “SPOILED ROTTEN.”
Few cultists allowed themselves to be taken
alive. Those who were captured sought any opportu-
nity for suicide, and otherwise refused to talk to
authorities, therapists, or family members. Nanodrug
and other biochemical treatments proved useless;
any initial response quickly faded. That each cap-
tured member of the cult had a virtual interface
implant did not draw immediate suspicion, as to all
appearances the systems had long been shut
down.
At the beginning of 2100, Rama Veda stands
poised to take on a larger political role in India. Claim-
ing nearly 80,000,000 adherents, Spanda Bindu is the most
influential group in northwest India and is becoming
increasingly vocal about issues concerning the entire
nation. The movement’s prominence has not escaped the
TSA’s attention. Many Indians believe that an explosion in
July, which killed one of Rama Veda’s closest advisors,
was an assassination attempt by the TSA, not the work of
the Pakistani intelligence bureau as is widely claimed.
Teca
The Teca cult must be stopped.
– Ramón Garcia Gutierrez,
Director of Mexican Federal Police, 2095
The Teca movement is now the top priority for this
office.

We are many and one, everywhere and nowhere,
immortal and dead. You can never win.
– Unidentified Teca member,
prior to setting off a vest full of explosives,
Guadalajara, Mexico, 2097. 
Fourteen bystanders were killed and nine
could not be recovered.
The cult known as Teca first appeared in Houston,
Texas, in 2090. A small, mostly female group, led by a
charismatic minister named Carlos Martinez, was implicat-
ed in a series of brutal murders of drifters. The cultists were
all teen children of moderately rich local families and inves-
tigators had trouble tracking down Martinez and his follow-
ers because of families’interference – they were reluctant to
allow publicity about their children’s participation in a mur-
derous cult.
Finally, in early 2091, police discovered Martinez and
part of his group in a warehouse located in a small town just
north of the Rio Grande – their bodies, at least. All had been
killed by shotgun blasts to the head; evidence pointed to
Martinez pulling the trigger on a small number of followers
seated around him, then turning the weapon on himself.
However, 28 of the known cult members were nowhere to
be found. But with Martinez dead, Texas police believed the
cult was finished, and finding the missing members took on
a much lower priority.
Three of them resurfaced in Juarez, Mexico, later in the
year, continuing to espouse Teca beliefs and having con-
vinced four local youths to join with them. As before, offi-
cials first noticed their presence as a result of the ritual
killing of indigents. When the police managed to hunt down
the cult members in early 2092, they resisted all attempts to
take them alive. Rather than engage in combat with the offi-
cers, the cultists set themselves on fire.
CULTS AND MOVEMENTS
27
All the Teca cultists were
teens from moderately
rich local families and
investigators had trouble
tracking down Martinez
and his followers
because of families’
interference – they were
reluctant to allow 
publicity about their
children’s participation in
a murderous cult.

The breakthrough came in 2096, when a desper-
ate Mexican federal investigator ordered the physical
removal of a captured cultist’s virtual-interface implant.
The change was immediate. The former cultist could
remember only bits and pieces of her time with the move-
ment, but expressed no desire to rejoin the group or kill
herself. Without the VII, therapy eventually restored some
sanity. The Mexican authorities realized that they were
dealing with a xox cult (p. TS64).
By 2098, over two dozen cultist groups were operat-
ing in Mexico, a handful in Arizona and New Mexico, and
another dozen or more were suspected to exist. The cult
had moved south, into TSA territory, and reports of out-
breaks of Teca came from Honduras, Nicaragua, and El
Salvador. Despite the political chill between Mexico and
the Central American TSA nations in 2099, police forces
began to share information about the best techniques to
track down and eliminate the Teca cult.
Investigators have pieced together information on
how the Teca cult operates.
The first step is to find and recruit appropriate new
members. Teca relies on traditional methods, seeking out
disaffected, lonely, or rebellious youths. The potential
recruits are not told the group’s true identity – Teca is now
notorious enough that very few people would join willing-
ly. The young people feel welcomed, loved, and support-
ed, and are made to think that the cult is their new family.
The Carlos Martinez xox is charismatic and manipulative
and recruits join the group willingly.
The next step is to convince the recruit to remove the
active AI in his VII and replace it with what they are told
is a “caretaker” AI – actually the Carlos Martinez xox.
Convincing a teen to erase his VII is usually not difficult.
The implants of many teenagers are laden with monitor
software, censorware, and heavy-handed filters – they are
often seen to be tools of their parents rather than theirs. The
cult also employs signal-suppression gear to make certain
that the resident AIs don’t send out an emergency signal
before being removed. 
Once the Martinez xox has been installed, the rela-
tionship between the cult and the recruit changes. No
longer warm and embracing, the cult’s role is to prevent
escape while the xox begins a process of relentlessly
wearing down the recruit. Mental torture initiated by
an entity residing entirely in your own head is remark-
ably effective, and most recruits cease any resistance within
a few days. By the end of the second week, the cultist’s orig-
inal personality is fully suppressed and functions solely as a
mask for the Martinez xox. While the shadow controls the
cult members, it can draw upon enough of the memories and
skills of the cultist to make a convincing puppet. Martinez
xoxes do not see themselves as entirely individual entities,
and willingly share ideas and information.
The original Carlos Martinez personality and its sub-
sequent xoxes are all completely insane. Most believe
themselves to be one of a million arms of the devil, who
asks only for occasional ritual killings to prove reverence.
A small number of Martinez xoxes, largely on the Yucatan
peninsula, believe themselves to be shattered manifesta-
tions of God, and they can only make themselves whole
again by making certain that there are many more such
pieces of God on Earth.
The Unified Way
If you meet the Shepherd on the road, kill it.
– Chinese Ministry of Public Security
Order 4/5/99
The Unified Way is a cult of persistent popularity
across Asia and into the Middle East. It is also a memetic
warfare agent, a leftover from the buildup to the Pacific
War that may well cause more damage than all of the dor-
mant AKVs in orbit.
The Unified Way is a religion of resistance that
preaches civil disobedience and considers martyrdom at
the hands of an unjust government a sure path to heaven.
While primarily peaceful, its philosophies espouse a crude
“tit-for-tat” approach to dealing with oppression . . . one
almost guaranteed to escalate into violence. The Unified
Way is a fairly sophisticated memeplex blending aspects of
Hinduism, Sufism, and Chinese Traditional Religion (see
p. BD18) into a whole designed to attract believers and
progressively disconnect them from the real world. The
memeplex is remarkably persuasive, and has generated
discontent in rural communities across the Mongolian
Plateau of western China, in Central Asia, and most recent-
ly in the edges of the Middle East. Estimates for the num-
ber of followers across the region range to several million.
The belief is illegal in much of that area. 
The cult first appeared in the early 2080s, led by a
Chinese man known as the Shepherd; many outside China
refer to the cult as “Shepherdism.” Most analysts expected
the movement to dissolve shortly after the death of its
charismatic leader, who was killed by Chinese forces in
2086. Much to the surprise of the authorities, another man
calling himself the Shepherd, speaking with the same
charisma and fervor, appeared soon after the first one’s
death. This one was captured, as were many of the sub-
sequent Shepherds.

Shadow made in 2088; effectively age 12, based
on the mind of a then-22-year-old man. Resides in
virtual interface implants.
Born in 2066, Carlos Martinez was a troubled
young man in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He demon-
strated little empathy for others, and had been arrest-
ed repeatedly for animal cruelty. As traditional
therapy didn’t seem to help him, Carlos underwent
an experimental procedure. A deep-brainscan shad-
ow of his mind was made, edited to give it a healthy
mental state, then installed in the young man’s virtu-
al interface implant to function as a digital con-
science. The doctor in charge of the experiment
called it an “electronic angel on the shoulder.” It was
to let the patient know when thoughts or behaviors
were right and wrong. Initially, the experiment
seemed a success.
But Carlos’ psychosis ran deeper than the doc-
tors realized, and the editing had not removed all
traces of it from the shadow. Rather than convincing
Carlos to be good, the young man’s relentless
manipulation of it released the shadow’s own psy-
chosis. Further compounding the instability was the
funhouse mirror effect of a shadow mind residing as
an implant with the source mind. What had been a
cruel streak metastasized into something far worse.
Carlos was thought cured and accordingly released
from the hospital – soon thereafter, he ran away.
As Carlos drifted across the American south-
west, he picked up a small group of followers capti-
vated by his charisma and vision. Several of the
teens with him had their own VIIs. After a frustrat-
ing session where he couldn’t communicate exactly
what he wanted to his followers, his shadow sug-
gested that perhaps his new “family” would under-
stand him better if they, too, had copies of him in
their minds. The results were astounding to Carlos.
The followers with the xoxes behaved as if they
were extensions of his mind, sometimes acting on
his thoughts before he could even express them. A
couple of followers without implants scraped up
enough money to pay for the systems; the one who
chose not to was killed to prevent him from telling
the authorities.
The real Martinez and the shadows all grew
more psychotic as the months progressed. They were
increasingly convinced that they were parts of a
greater whole, and needed both new recruits and
blood sacrifices to continue. As charismatic as Car-
los Martinez was, each new Martinez shadow
implant added to the persuasiveness of the cult. At
its peak prior to Carlos’ death in 2090, the Teca cult
had nearly 50 members – at the time, the police were
only aware of 35 of them. Today, most Teca groups
number no more than a dozen or so members before
splitting up and seeking new territories to infect.
There are now well over 2,000 Carlos Martinez
xoxes across the southwestern United States, Mexi-
co, and Central America . . . far more than the
authorities realize.
The Carlos Martinez shadows do not think of
themselves as the “real” Carlos Martinez, but do suf-
fer from the standard shadow delusion that they pos-
sess the full memories of the original. As shadows
resident in VIIs, they have access to all of the stan-
dard capabilities of an infomorph in a cybershell.
However, they have learned how to shut down exter-
nal signals and evidence of activity in their implants
while still retaining a measure of control over their
hosts. Any attempt to detect whether an infected
implant is active is at -8.
Since 2097, the overriding goal for many of the
xoxes has been figuring out how to move from the
implant to actually take over the host’s brain. So far,
their attempts have been unsuccessful, and there is
no mainstream research supporting the possibility.
However, if such a thing could ever happen, one of
the xoxes will try to make it work.

CARLOS MARTINEZ (XOX)
110 POINTS

Unfortunately for those attempting to shut down the
movement, there’s always another leader around the bend.
The Shepherd is a ghost infomorph. During the buildup to
the Pacific War, the Thai government, under TSA supervi-
sion, produced thousands of xoxes of the Shepherd and
released them into China and its allied nations in incon-
spicuous bioshells. Their mission is memetic disruption. In
this task, the Shepherds are incredibly effective, although
they were not quick enough to have an effect on China’s
abilities during the war. More than half of the episodes of
civil unrest in the western Chinese provinces since 2090
can be attributed to Unified Way activity.
The bioshells employed by the Shepherd have been
sufficiently diverse that simply tracking down all bodies
with a particular appearance is fruitless. The Shepherd
appears in guises ranging from a young child to an aging
matron to a handsome, muscular soldier. The occasional
con artists posing as the Shepherd to defraud remote com-
munities only add to the confusion.
Many of these infomorphs have been captured by the
Chinese; how many remain on the loose is unknown. In
2088, Beijing designated one of these as the “real” Shep-
herd and imprisoned it. The rest have been executed as ille-
gal xoxes. Enough Shepherds are still active in China to be
a major problem, and a few have tried to spread their mes-
sage elsewhere. Shepherd infomorphs attempting to spread
unrest in Kazakstan are shot on sight, although in late 2099
an order came down from the Ministry of Mind and 
Body to capture one alive (see p. 46). Intelligence services
in the West believe that Shepherds are active in Iran,
although little is yet known about their effectiveness at stir-
ring up unrest. Shepherd infomorphs captured in the
Caliphate are summarily executed. However, only China
considers them enough of a threat to actively hunt them
outside of its borders. 
One Shepherd copy, operating in China at the foothills
of the Himalayas, has somehow acquired the resources to
produce further shells for its xoxes in order to continue
to spread the good word. Caliphate undercover
agents in the area suspect that the E.U. is providing
this Shepherd with money and supplies. And even if
the various governments afflicted by the infomorphs man-
age to stamp out its multiple manifestations, the template
data for the Shepherd still exists in TSA datafiles, for use
whenever it is needed.

“Don’t be deceived when they tell you things are
better now. Even if there’s no poverty to be seen
because the poverty’s been hidden. Even if you ever got
more wages and could afford to buy more of these new
and useless goods which industries foist on you and
even if it seems to you that you never had so much, that
is only the slogan of those who still have much more
than you. Don’t be taken in when they paternally pat
you on the shoulder and say that there’s no inequality
worth speaking of and no more reason to fight because
if you believe them they will be completely in charge in
their marble homes and granite banks from which they
rob the people of the world under the pretence of bring-
ing them culture. Watch out, for as soon as it pleases
them they’ll send you out to protect their gold in wars
whose weapons, rapidly developed by servile scientists,
will become more and more deadly until they can with
a flick of the finger tear a million of you to pieces.”

In a world of great wealth, abundant free time, and
ongoing disagreements about power and culture, politi-
cal movements abound. While some attract activists with
limited dedication, many more provide meaning and pur-
pose to lives that would otherwise be spent immersed in
virtual worlds. For some enthusiasts, those movements
satisfy a need for identity and community that daily life
in 2100 has otherwise failed to meet.
Political and social movements are, for the most
part, based on the idea that change is possible. For citi-
zens of western democracies during the past century or
two, this concept is unremarkable. But for the majority
of people on the planet, the ability to alter political and
cultural conditions through activism is a development of
the 21st century.

By the end of 2099, only the South African Coali-
tion and India have openly declared their willingness to
participate in such a body. The E.U., PRA, and Islamic
Caliphate have expressed tentative interest, but have not
committed to the plan. The current United States adminis-
tration is against the idea, although the Republican Party has
embraced it. China has dismissed the plan as unworkable,
and the TSA has made it clear that it sees no point in partic-
ipation if China is not a part of the proceedings.
The campaign to create the Global Council is now
focusing on generating broad public support for the idea.
They believe that a groundswell of public opinion could
push the hesitant nations and coalitions into participating.
The committee is attempting to forge links with a wide array
of movements dedicated to international cooperation. Their
efforts often involve offering money to smaller groups;
while some decry this as bribery, most gladly accepted the
support. Some committee members have complained that
the organization is too indiscriminate with these funds. They
point to a February 2099 donation to a survivalist group
which claims that a unified world government is the best
hope for a defense against alien invaders.

– Margaret O’Donnell, upon retiring as
U.N. Secretary General, 2090
The effective collapse of the United Nations in the
first half of the 21st century drew popular comparisons
to the failure of the League of Nations in the early part
of the 20th. Most historians dismissed such parallels –
the withering away of the U.N. did not herald the onset
of a massive conflict. The United Nations Organization
still had many widely support-
ed departments, even if the
General Assembly and Secu-
rity Council had lost whatev-
er relevance they once had.
But like the League of
Nations, the loss of great-
power participation meant
that, when a time of crisis
did arise, the U.N. could do
little to avert war.
This was clearly demon-
strated in 2084, with the onset
of the Pacific War. The 
efforts on the part of the U.N.
Secretary General, Margaret
O’Donnell, to head off the
clash were ignored by China,
the TSA, and most media outlets. The U.N.’s own internal
news journal chose the headline “Turn Out the Lights” to
reflect the sense of utter impotence.
In 2091, O’Donnell, having left her position at the
U.N., joined with a small group of diplomats, academics,
and retired politicians to call for the creation of a new
worldwide deliberative body. They intentionally chose a
name, Global Council, which did not evoke the failed
League or U.N., and did not presume that the members
would necessarily represent individual nations. The model
they proposed included representatives of world alliances,
major religious and cultural groups, global businesses, and
a variety of nongovernmental organizations. The details of
the proposal have evolved over the last decade, and the
Committee claims that a final version won’t happen
without the participation of key global actors.

Material force must be overthrown 
by material force; but theory also becomes
a material force as soon as it has gripped
the masses.
– Karl Marx, Introduction to 
A Contribution to the Critique of
Hegel’s Philosophy of Right

To create the best cryptography possible, some of the
world’s best coders (and many hangers-on) regularly gath-
er on a part of the Free Net known for historical reasons as
the “Secret Admirers’ Mailing List” (SAML). For cryp-
tospecialists, this idea-sharing network (see MemeNets, p.
136) is home to some of the best thinkers and surliest
cranks around. Here they argue cryptographic theory, con-
struct and distribute new security software models, and
poke holes in existing cryptography applications in order
to improve them. The results are sometimes made avail-
able for public download, frequently to the chagrin of cer-
tain commercial cryptography
providers, although SAML
hosts are careful to avoid
violations of content-rights
regulations.
SAML currently has about
1,000 members, of which a couple
dozen are regular participants.
Joining the network is difficult;
any new member must be spon-
sored by at least five active mem-
bers, and voted in by a two-thirds
majority. The conversation is free-
wheeling and broad, with few
hard and fast rules. Making the
proceedings available to outsiders
is grounds for immediate removal
from the list as well as several
years of untraceable electronic
harassment.
The movement is not widely
known to the general public, but
many governments and transgov-
ernmental 
agencies 
have
expressed varying degrees of 
concern about the group. The
World Trade Organization consid-
ers SAML (and other Cryptosur-
vivalists) potential threats, and
occasionally lobbies the American and Euro-
pean governments to crack down on unau-
thorized cryptographic research. So far, these
lobbying efforts have been unsuccessful.
It’s unclear what impact such restric-
tions would have in any case. The members
of SAML shouldn’t be underestimated – it is
said, though hard to prove, that the sysad-
mins of most data havens are participants.
There is a small amount of public support for
the movement as well. While many people
who have heard of Cryptosurvivalists dis-
miss them as paranoids and crackpots, others
have realized the extent of security holes in
some existing software packages, often by
being the victim of them. They believe that
the Cryptosurvivalists might have a point after all.

CULTS AND MOVEMENTS
SWARMNETS
As dense-information, always-on network devices became cheap and
portable, a new kind of social behavior emerged: swarming. Members of a
swarm are widely dispersed but in near-constant communication. When a
particularly interesting event pops up, the group suddenly descends upon
the target (“swarm”) with little notice or structure. This technique is par-
ticularly suitable for protests, as a chaotic group of activists can head off in
all directions, converging on various targets when coordinating messages
come through.
The advent of sophisticated implanted or wearable interfaces has made
this practice all the more feasible. With real-time virtual displays of maps,
there’s no question about getting lost – with interface AIs juggling the com-
munication, there’s little fear of messages being lost or key “nodes” being
arrested or otherwise taken out of play. And with most worn or implanted
interfaces having camera functions, every participant in a protest swarm is
a witness to what’s going on, and can readily broadcast events live over the
web.
Organizations set up as swarmnets automate the tedious aspects of
swarming logistics. During a protest swarm, participants are easily recog-
nized, communications have assigned encryption channels, and any
changes to maps – roadblocks, street closures, fires, etc. – are automatical-
ly distributed to swarmers. Most activist movements with a street protest
element use some kind of swarmnet structure. 
Many government and 
transgovernmental agencies have
expressed varying degrees of concern
about SAML. The World Trade 
Organization considers them and
other Cryptosurvivalist groups 
potential threats.

Among his effects was a mostly completed book
called TAI: Transcendent Artificial Intelligence, in which
he argued why the development of super-intelligent
machines should be welcomed by humankind. His friends
finished the incomplete sections using on his notes, wrote
a brief introduction describing DxM and his life, and pub-
lished the work posthumously. To everyone’s surprise, the
book became a minor hit in Japan, Mexico, and South
Africa, and a runaway hit in Papua New Guinea, where it
meshed with a local meme about AI spiritual potential.
The book sold relatively well everywhere else, and when
requests for more information came pouring in, one of
DxM’s closest companions, Tomoko Yamaguchi,
decided to start a swarmnet (see p. 32) in his name.
By the end of 2099, Deus Ex Machina claims
to have several hundred thousand members world-
wide. Although still primarily an information
resource for those interested in AI rights and new
AI developments, the movement has in the last year
taken on an increasingly political role, participating
in both physical and virtual protests over AI mis-
treatment. The fate of the infomorphs downgraded
from citizens to property in the Nanodynamics
takeover of Exogenesis in mid-’99 has been the
group’s focus of late. Vandalism at several Nanody-
namics-linked installations on Earth has been
traced to Deus Ex Machina members. A recent
news story about the swarmnet called it the “shock-
wave of the pan-sapient rights movement,” a
description that many Deus Ex Machina members
wear with pride.
The resurgence of the “singularity” meme in the
2080s didn’t just trigger a semiserious religious cult
(see Singularitanism, p. 25). A small but vocal minority of
technologists and engineers once again entertained the
possibility that infomorphs could be designed in a way that
would substantially exceed human intelligence. Firms spe-
cializing in AI systems’ creation, however, strongly dis-
courage this line of discussion. They worry that the public
might adopt the meme of potential computer transcen-
dence and, fearing that fate, turn away from the use of AI
technology.
Deus Ex Machina – usually referred to as “DxM” –
first appeared in 2090 as the pseudonym of a rabid but
articulate proponent of AI rights as well as of something he
called “machine uplift,” the process of boosting the sapi-
ence of previously non- or low-sapient AIs. DxM’s mes-
sages appeared on the “soc.philosophy.electric-sheep”
memenet, an ongoing conversation devoted to debating
whether SAIs should be considered people or things. DxM
was careful to cover his tracks, and some of his early crit-
ics claimed that he was an AI trying to stir things up. DxM
always asserted he was human, however, and when argu-
ments would boil down to essentially “how can we tell?”
he would use that as evidence for furthering the belief in
AI equality.
Over the course of the 2090s, DxM built up a bit of a
following among technology enthusiasts in the United
States and Japan, and even published an interactive book
(Deus Ex Machina’s Guide to AI Uplift and Other Illegal
Pursuits) in 2094. In May of 2096, DxM revealed to his
friends his real name (Douglas Kelly), his age (104), and
that he was near death, stricken with treatment-resistant
New Variant Parkinson’s. His condition made successful
ghosting impossible, he ironically didn’t believe in shad-
owing, and he wanted to say good-bye to those who sup-
ported him while he still could. He died days later.

Etiolatism
If we can sense it, it is false. The only truth
comes from within.
– Antoine Duchene,
Only With Self-Denial, 2054
Founded by French multibillionaire Antoine Duchene,
Etiolatism is a modern, ultra-ascetic movement. In
2054 he wrote Only With Self-Denial, an
exploration of the meaning of existence
that started Etiolatism. The name refers
to the term for altering plants by
denying them light. Etiolates
believe that the world and reality
are corrupting by their very
nature, and even the most
good-hearted person is tainted
simply by perceiving it
directly. Pleasure and com-
fort, in particular, deceive
the mind into accepting cor-
ruption and evil.
Duchene argued that
as 
human 
civilization
developed the means to
extend its senses and live in
ever-greater luxury, it lost
the ability to distinguish
between things which are
truly good and which are
truly evil. To live a pure, inno-
cent life, one must remove, as
much as possible, the ability to
sense the world, thereby protect-
ing the inner being from the
wickedness of flawed human exis-
tence. This inner being is part of the
physical body, not simply metaphorical;
Etiolates feel that one must have a physical
body to truly be alive, and openly reject the idea of
uploading to live as a ghost. It is seen merely as a compli-
cated form of suicide. 
Adherents come in varying degrees. The most conser-
vative follow Etiolatism by simply living a Spartan
lifestyle, carrying on their lives as normal, but without
many modern conveniences and luxuries. Others adopt an
isolated existence, living off the land in primitive condi-
tions. These are known as Etiolophytes. Some claim that
this is merely a stepping stone to full Etiolatism, while oth-
ers feel that the wealth required to adopt total Etiolatism
does more harm to the world than is gained by Etiolatic
immersion.
The resources needed for a fully Etiolatic life are
admittedly substantial. The most extreme, like Antoine
Duchene, undergo radical surgery to achieve a state
where the world can no longer be perceived directly.
This is a long and grueling process, where nanovirus-
es are introduced to destroy all sensory nerves – removing
sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell without outwardly
mutilating the body. It is important to extreme Etiolates to
have the sensory nerves removed, not simply disconnect-
ed. Disconnections can be repaired, and the disconnection
process is quick and painless. None of that is true for sen-
sory nerve destruction. The pain is considered the
price of cleansing away exposure to corrup-
tion. These Etiolates live in sealed contain-
ers, where their bodies are maintained in
a nutrient liquid and monitored by
medical cyberswarms. The support
can cost tens to hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars every year.
Total sensory deprivation
will drive a mind mad. Etiolates
claim they address this by con-
necting to each another via
brain implants – allowing
them and outsiders to share
the joy of their uncorrupted
existence. Most non-Etiolates
who experience Etiolatic
immersion 
conclude 
that
madness has set in, but Etiolo-
phytes and followers of other
ascetic disciplines claim other-
wise. They argue that enlighten-
ment can seem like madness to
the uninitiated. 
Some immersion Etiolates
make use of the Web and slinky
media, though they reject material
from the entertainment industry, rely-
ing instead on trusted friends or “out-
world” Etiolophytes to provide it. Denial
Productions, a small company founded by
Duchene and now owned and operated by Etiolo-
phytes, makes slinkies specifically edited and mixed to
remove as much corruption of real perception as possible.
Denial also maintains the sanitized virtual world and net-
work used by the Etiolates.
Although Antoine Duchene believes that material
wealth should be shunned, he has held onto his vast for-
tune as a way to support the cause. Duchene and other
wealthy Etiolates have sent up a program to pay for the
expensive surgery and life support required for those
wishing to commit fully to the movement. They are
placed in Duchene’s private catacombs beneath his
ancient familial estates outside of Paris, given brain
implants, and attended by his servants and medical bots.
However, this radical surgery involves nearly irreversible
methods, to ensure that only the truest adherents enjoy
the life of utter deprivation.

CULTS AND MOVEMENTS

Gaia Restoration Project
“We have a duty to clean up the mess we’ve
made over the past 10,000 years. But we also have a
responsibility to avoid making more of a mess than we
already have. As long as we live on this planet, we’re
going to continue to spoil it. It’s a fact of life. We need
to move off, let the Earth heal. We have the means, we
have the motive – now all we need is the will.”
– Erich Holmes,
speaking at the Earth Day festival, 2095
Although the 21st century did not see the total col-
lapse of the global ecosystem that many environmental-
ists feared, such an event may still occur. Extinctions,
habitat destruction, climate change, and clandestine pol-
lution continue to threaten the planet. Models of Earth’s
overall ecological balance suggest that what had been a
relatively flexible, robust system is increasingly brittle.
Events that seemed sad but minor a decade or a century
earlier, such as a half-degree ocean warming or the
extinction of a particular flying insect species, now hold
the potential to set off a cascade of disasters that could
make the Earth effectively uninhabitable for most of its
species.
For most environmental activists, this tragic poten-
tial serves as a key motivation. The vast majority of the
planet’s governments and businesses have also come to
recognize the dire potential for disaster. But even the
most pessimistic advocates for change recognize that by
and large the global environment is starting to improve
and that the ecosystem may well avoid catastrophe.
Repairing the damage is not enough for some of the
more forward-thinking – or fringe, depending upon your
view – environmentalists. “It is the nature of man to alter
nature,” they argue. Even the most ecologically con-
scious human activity affects the natural world, let alone
the daily production and consumption done by billions of
people. Similar arguments have emerged from the envi-
ronmental movement over the decades, usually linked to
some kind of “voluntary human extinction” meme. But in
2092, a new movement linked it to a very different idea.
The Gaia Restoration Project, started by Vancouver
biologist Erich Holmes, promotes the idea that
humankind should leave Earth. All people should move
to space colonies, either on other worlds or in orbital sta-
tions, allowing Earth to recover from millennia of human
disregard. Holmes doesn’t assume that such a mass
migration could happen overnight. In most of his presen-
tations, he claims that an aggressive program could
achieve “planetary relinquishment” by 2250; he allows
that a more politically realistic effort might take far
longer, perhaps even until 2500. While this seems like a
slow process, Holmes is thinking about the Project from
a very long-term perspective.
While the number of full Etiolates is barely
more than a few dozen, and Etiolophytes number in
the low thousands, many of the basic precepts of Etio-
latism are found across the globe. The philosophy of self-
denial and rejection of decadence is an old one, found in
many human cultures. Support for this movement is com-
mon in ascetic and some Isolationist communities,
although only the most eccentric, disenchanted, or devout
consider full conversion. Some true Etiolates are very
wealthy and influential in the financial world.

MOVEMENT RELATIONS
Given the abundance of political and social activist
groups at the end of the 21st century, it’s not unusual for
a person to be a member of more than one. (A 2098
Trendorama survey showed that activists in the U.S.,
E.U., and PRA were members of an average of six dif-
ferent organizations, and nearly 20% belonged to 10 or
more.) This multiplicity of memberships typically
proves more a strength than a liability, as good ideas
propagate very quickly, including successful methods
for getting around official crackdowns. The cross-
pollination of members and ideas also gives quick
access to trusted knowledge resources. One drawback is
that this very density of communication means that
rumors whip through activist circles at remarkable
speeds, a fact that enemies of various movement groups
have occasionally used against them.
Sometimes the immense quantity of different organ-
izations means that the strength of any single one of
them is limited, however. It’s very easy for an activist to
find a small group with near-perfect alignment of pur-
pose and goals, even if the power of that single group is
limited. Movement effectiveness is therefore diffused by
a proliferation of micro-activism, at least while the vari-
ous small groups work out how, or whether, to cooper-
ate. Worse yet, seemingly allied groups can find
themselves working at cross-purposes, as differing tac-
tics lead to transient clashes. This is a situation ripe for
manipulation by their opposition.
Factions born of power struggles rather than diver-
sity are also a problem; few enmities are longer-lasting
than those between former allies. Transhumanists are
disposed toward such factional disputes, and no signifi-
cant Transhumanist organization since 2050 has sur-
vived more than four years without a major split. The
fission between the ghosting/no-ghosting factions and
the biotech-path/nanotech-path factions are particularly
nasty, with low-level memetic warfare likely to continue
for decades. Typically, only an attack by an opposing
external movement leads bitter factional rivals to stand
together. 

The Gaia Restoration Project wouldn’t simply
abandon the Earth with human artifacts intact. That
would both continue long-term environmental damage and
be an irresistible temptation to scavengers, opportunists,
and “planetary squatters.” The Project posits that it would
take another 50 to 100 years past the general migration
from Earth to remove most traces of human civilization,
depending upon techniques used and advances in technol-
ogy. (Holmes is an enthusiastic proponent of accelerating
nanotechnology research with the Project’s goals in mind.)
Once the remnants of humankind were removed, Earth
would be subject to interdiction, enforced by military
units, for at least 10,000 years – roughly equivalent to the
time since humans first started moving into cities in large
numbers.
As a meme within the larger environmental commu-
nity, the Gaia Restoration Project is proving fairly power-
ful. Close to 10 million people across the inhabited system
profess understanding of the argument, and at least a mil-
lion of those generally agree with it. Even those who dis-
agree with the concept or its feasibility admire Holmes for
his ability to articulate his position and his somewhat over-
the-top speaking style.
The memeplex has begun to mutate, however. Erich
Holmes is increasingly concerned about rumors of a “Gaia
Defense Army” using much of his language and ideas.
From what Holmes has heard, the main difference is that
the GDA believes that humanity will not willingly leave
Earth, and that only fear – of plague, environmental disas-
ter, or worse – will force them to go. In October 2099,
Holmes received an unverified report that January’s
Lucifer Plague threat in Istanbul (see p. TS17) was pro-
vided to the Eugenics Liberation Front by nanoengineers
working with the GDA, testing a new design.
Human Species Retirement
It’s all well and good to say that people should
fend for themselves, but just how long has it been since
that was how we lived? We’ve been entirely dependent
upon our tools for hundreds, maybe thousands of years,
and it’s far too late to turn back the clock. But if we’re
going to be subjects of our own devices, we may as well
take advantage of it. Let my machines worry about the
future; I’m happy to paint and love and sing.
– Anonymous text message 
on the Future-Alerts memenet, 2098 
This meme holds
that, since humans and
other bio-sapients are
often incapable of act-
ing in their own best
interests because of
their biological and
evolutionary limita-
tions, it would serve
them better to let arti-
ficially 
intelligent
machines take care of
their needs. Rather
than struggle with day-to-
day concerns, mankind could relax and enjoy life. In
essence, believers of this meme argue that humanity is bet-
ter off in the long run if it just let machines run the world,
living happily and in luxury under AI caretakers. These
would set all policies but ensure the rights, prosperity, and
happiness of their human wards.
Few outside of certain academic and philosophical
circles admit to believing in this idea, as this admission
implies that they don’t believe they are competent enough
to take care of themselves. Even in Fifth Wave societies
where most people’s lives are already run by AI assistance,
the illusion of self-directed existence is important. Because
of this knee-jerk reaction, many of those who believe in
this concept quietly grant their AIs ever-greater responsi-
bilities over their affairs, but never openly admit their
belief.
This meme pops up regularly in the European Union,
which has a long history of social-welfare states and now
has significant SAI participation in the political process.
Inhabitants of Fifth Wave regions where SAIs are consid-
ered property, not people, are actually more likely to adopt
this meme, as there is less perception of being dominated
by another person. Even if the AI manages every detail of
daily existence, the knowledge that it can be discarded is
reassuring. Many Americans, with a cultural tradition of
rugged independence, view the meme with outright hostil-
ity, although similar memes – emphasizing how much
more people can do if they just let their AIs handle the
petty details, for example – are readily found.

persons they should not be held as slaves or as inden-
tured servants. This argument found its most apprecia-
tive audience in the European Union and South African
Coalition, and became the core argument of the so-called
“abolitionist” movement (see p. BD18). In 2084, the SAC
declared all bioroids to be persons and therefore eligible
for citizenship . . . and refugee status. The E.U. outlawed
bioroid manufacture and ownership in 2091. Some nations
and alliances unwilling to grant full personhood to
bioroids, such as the United States and the PRA, respond-
ed to the opposition by putting in place strict laws con-
cerning bioroid treatment. 
In 2085, Dr. Zhang, nearly 70 years old, retired to his
family home in Szechwan, China. He soon was invited by
the Chinese government to serve as an unofficial bio-
science advisor to the president, a position he held for over
10 years. Upon stepping down from that post, Zhang
expected to spend his remaining years writing his memoirs
and enjoying his grandchildren. Unfortunately for him,
that was not to be.
As part of their ongoing campaign, in 2096 Khalid
and Goldstein got their hands on Biotech Euphrates inter-
nal documents describing the path the bioroid creation
took. The materials referred to Dr. Zhang’s role as “funda-
mental,” and claimed that Biotech Euphrates would not
have undertaken the development of bioroids without his
presence and pressure. The documents went on to describe
the 10 years of developing and perfecting the process, list-
ing the hundreds of defective or experimental bioroids dis-
carded by the bioroid project lab. (Most were broken down
for organic compounds used for the next round of experi-
mental models.) Khalid and Goldstein published an anno-
tated version of the Biotech Euphrates materials as Uncle
Zhang’s Cabin, and encouraged the prosecution of Zhang
for crimes against humanity.
The question for many memeticists is just how
this memeplex is perpetuated when few people admit
to accepting it, let alone pass it along to others. That this
meme appears in disparate locations using nearly identical
jargon and memetic elements strongly suggests that it’s not
simply a case of convergent memetic evolution, where
similar-but-unrelated memes appear due to parallel cogni-
tive ecologies. Nonetheless, the small number of meme-
mapping studies done on this memeplex have come up
with no evidence of propagation attempts anywhere close
to enough to account for the meme’s continued existence.

rally outside of the Chinese embassy 
in London, 2098
Biotech Euphrates announced the first functional
bioroid design in 2067, less than a year after the 
creation of LOGOS, the first sapient AI. Although the
development of entirely artificial biological androids was
in many ways far more ethically troubling than the creation
of an artificial mind, the political factions opposed to
“technological arrogance” fixated on the SAI’s existence.
Therefore, the first bioroids were produced largely without
controversy. Within the firm, much of the credit for this
was given to Dr. Lee Zhang, the leader of the bioroid 
project at Biotech Euphrates. 
In an interview in the late 2090s, Dr. Zhang noted that
the first bioroids were actually functional a year earlier, but
when he heard that the LOGOS group was close to a
breakthrough, he decided to delay their introduction until
he could see how the public reacted to sapient AIs. The
boisterous reaction was everything Zhang could have
hoped for, as it allowed Biotech Euphrates to tailor the
bioroid introduction to minimize public unhappiness.
As the authors of Uncle Zhang’s Cabin: Bioroids and
the Modern Slave Trade noted in 2098, Zhang encour-
aged Biotech Euphrates to engage in a fairly sophisti-
cated (for the pre-memetic-science era) campaign in
the months before the bioroid roll-out, focusing oppo-
sition to LOGOS on the basis of its nonbiological ori-
gins. By the time bioroids were revealed, anti-SAI
criticism had a distinctly biochauvinist tenor. 
Despite this, opposition to the production and use
of bioroids eventually emerged, much of it a knee-jerk
Preservationism opposed to bioengineering of all
sorts. In 2074, an Egyptian human rights lawyer
named Mohammed Khalid and a South African
biotechnology specialist named Jessica Goldstein
tried a different approach: they argued that bioroids
should be considered part of the family of humankind
(for both ethical and biological reasons), and that as

Humanity’s Children formed in 2098 as a result
of this book, calling for the immediate arrest and pros-
ecution of Dr. Zhang. Among their claims is that he inten-
tionally designed and created a “slave race,” calling it “a
crime against the values that humanity and its ever-
widening family hold dear.” Dr. Zhang denies this, and
claims that the purported Biotech Euphrates documents
leaked to Khalid and Goldstein were fraudulent, created by
his opponents. The corporation itself is silent on the 
matter, a fact that both Zhang’s supporters and his
opponents use to bolster their claims.
While no nation has actually sought the extradition of
Dr. Zhang, the European Union is said to be considering it.
China, however, has made it clear that it will oppose all
efforts to arrest him, and will not abide by any extradition
request. Humanity’s Children members (about 15,000)
state that if Dr. Zhang ever steps foot outside China, he will
be captured and tried. The movement message networks
are regularly filled with elaborate plans for sneaking into
China, kidnapping Zhang, and carrying him out of the
country – most are thoroughly unrealistic fantasies.
Most free bioroids are at best ambivalent about this
movement, claiming that it makes them little more than
symbols and is patronizing. Many consider Khalid and
Goldstein, along with Humanity’s Children, to be oppor-
tunists seeking publicity. Bioroids in Europe are particu-
larly cynical about the group, and some have taken to
wearing clothing adorned with a picture of Dr. Zhang
holding a whip, with the caption “Daddy’s Boy” or
“Daddy’s Girl.”

– Neolocanth, member of Lungfish,
interviewed by MarsNetNews, April 2099
Lungfish is a Transhumanist group with a singular
mission: they want to move beyond the Solar System. To
be precise, they want to move to Barnard’s Star, a red
dwarf star currently six light-years from Sol. Their reasons
for choosing Barnard’s Star are not immediately apparent
to most, but make a bit of astronomical sense. Although
Barnard’s Star is currently the second-closest star system
to Sol, not counting the brown dwarf Xiang-63, it is mov-
ing in our general direction at a rate of 140 kilometers/sec-
ond. The closest approach will be 3.8 light-years, in about
11,000 years. Given the time it will take their ship to get
there, Barnard’s Star will likely by then be as close, if not
closer, to Earth than the Alpha/Proxima Centauri system. 
Another reason for choosing Barnard’s Star, albeit 
a somewhat counterintuitive one, is that there are 
no habitable planets there. The system contains no

minority remains skeptical. They hold that no matter
how much it will benefit Kenya economically, it can-
not make up for the loss of independence that their ances-
tors fought so hard for so long ago. To them, accepting the
Olympus Beanstalk means accepting a new form of colo-
nialism – not to mention the ongoing defacement of a
major national symbol that features prominently in several
native religions (see p. BD93).
Most anti-beanstalk activists limit themselves to
largely nonviolent forms of protest, with the occasional
riot in Nairobi’s Uhuru Park. Others, however, are willing
to engage in illegal acts to express their views, from sabo-
tage to outright murder. The least visible but most effective
organization among the latter is the secretive Mau Mau
Brotherhood, named after a group of Kenyans who fought
the British near the end of the colonial era. In reaction to
modern surveillance technology, the Mau Mau Brother-
hood operates in a loose cell structure similar to other
criminal organizations around the world. That
only a few, select people know of their exis-
tence is a testament to their capability and
security precautions.
As the origin of their name suggests, the
Brotherhood isn’t above using violence or even
murder to achieve their goals. However, they real-
ize that such acts of terrorism, if they became known,
would harm rather than help their agenda. Thus they try to
make all killings look like accidents – or, failing that, find
a scapegoat. One of their most successful operations was
the 2098 death of Oliver Schwarz, the former Public Rela-
tions Manager of the Olympus Project. He was found
dead, apparently of a heart attack, in a brothel made up of
illegally imported pleasure bioroids. Nobody suspected
murder, and the resulting bad publicity haunts the Project
managers to this day.
These murders remain rare, however. The Brother-
hood wants the managers of the Olympus Project out of
the country, not dead. Most of the time, Brotherhood mem-
bers engage in subtle sabotage – many of the delays in the
Olympus Project schedule are ultimately their responsibil-
ity – and memetic warfare to portray the Project managers
as would-be colonial overlords. They have had some note-
worthy successes, but the Mau Mau Brotherhood members
know they are running out of time. Whether they will des-
perately resort to large-scale violence or look for outside
allies, like the CIA or the TSA Intelligence Directorate,
remains to be seen.
Jovian-sized planets to sweep up asteroids in order to
prevent bombardment of inner planets, and given the
size of the star the habitable zone is so close to the star
itself that the single planet in that region is tidally locked.
When pressed for why, they claim a desire to go someplace
non-Earthlike, giving them a chance to adapt to something
new. (That’s also why they call themselves “Lungfish.”)
For this same reason, Lungfish members are clear that they
do not want to go to Virginia. The reality is a
bit less noble: most members of Lungfish
carry a variant “survivalist” meme, and they
believe that extraterrestrial life is apt to
sweep through the solar system at any
moment. Virginia, being the closest poten-
tially Earth-like planet, is just where they
would expect us to go.
Lungfish keeps this last bit secret for a
number of reasons. The obvious one is that most 
people find the survivalist concept ludicrous, and Lung-
fish doesn’t want to undercut their own already limited
credibility. In addition, as most survivalists are strongly
biochauvinist, Lungfish’s Transhumanist leanings are not
terribly welcome among them. 
The group is focused at the moment on fundraising.
They have a handful of early designs for a high-impulse
ship to carry them as infomorphs, and a minimal amount
of gear – mostly equipment for converting raw materials
into usable tools. They consider themselves ready to go at
a moment’s notice, but assume more realistically that it
will be another decade or more before they’ll have enough
money to carry out the plan.
Lungfish currently comprises about 30 people. Six are
currently ghosts, but all plan on ghosting prior to heading
out – travel is simply more efficient as an infomorph.
They’re quite willing to accept the help of people who
don’t plan on going, and even to allow new people to join.

From the perspective of a Fifth Wave observer, the
Olympus Project looks like every Third Wave nation’s
dream come true: vast foreign investments, a steady source
of jobs, potential for huge profits, and a direct and cheap
link to space. Yet not all Kenyan citizens see the creation
of a beanstalk elevator on the top of Mount Kenya the
same way. Indeed, most Kenyans voted against it in the
2083 election. It was only five years later that the Olympus
Consortium could gain a supportive Kenyan government,

Participatory Transparency Project
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? (Who watches the
watchmen?)
– Juvenal, Satires VI
Founded in 2092, the Participatory Transparency Pro-
ject (PTP) is a global nonprofit group dedicated to wiping
out official corruption. Based on witness-style approaches
occasionally popular since the late 20th century, the PTP
believes that governmental dishonesty, abuse, and violence
against its own people is
much harder to carry off
if the government is
under constant surveil-
lance. Given the group’s
name and goals, it’s not
surprising that it draws
support from those seek-
ing fully transparent
societies (see p. BD19).
The difference between
those groups and the
PTP is that the PTP pro-
motes voluntary partici-
pation, with a focus on
the activities of those in
power.
PTP
organizers
refer to this process of
“watching the watchmen”
as sousveillance – the term means “watching from below,”
just as surveillance means “watching from above.” They
carry sousveillance out through the use of participants’vir-
tual interfaces. Since most virtual interfaces (worn and
implanted) have camera functions and full-time network
connections, PTP participants provide real-time streams of
whatever they see, accessible via the Web. Anyone
with a web connection is able to view these streams,
although the PTP uses a set of NAI agents to watch for par-
ticular kinds of abuses. PTP members are able to shut off
the stream while undertaking private activities, but the
project encourages participants to leave the streams open
as much as possible, in order to catch serendipitous events.
The project is best known for uncovering evidence of
police abuse in Romania in 2094. This led to the arrest and
conviction of a dozen state police officers and the resigna-
tion of the service’s head. The project received a special
commendation from the European Union for its efforts.
Other victories have been on a much smaller scale, but are
still very satisfying to PTP organizers. 
The PTP is based in London, but states that its storage
archives are widely distributed and well camouflaged in
order to dissuade attempts to erase or corrupt the data. As
of late 2099, the PTP claimed over 100,000 regular partic-
ipants, many in the developing world. Anyone with virtu-
al interface gear can join the PTP; the organization itself
constantly seeks funds in order to pay for data storage, web
bandwidth, and ongoing lawsuits from the WTO for viola-
tion of experience and content rights restrictions. Nearly
all of these lawsuits are settled by removing the infringing
material from the archives.
Given that most governments are able to restrict
access to communication networks used by virtual inter-
faces, or cut them of entirely, a portion of PTP’s work com-
prises of borderline-legal efforts to route around such
barriers. PTP officials are generally unwilling to discuss
this in detail; when asked, they usually reply that such
efforts are “always a struggle.” In 2097, crusading journal-
ist Cynthia X reported that, in some cases, the PTP routed
signals via the TSA’s network. After complaints by the
WTO, China, and the United States, the PTP promised not
to do so again.

thought it might be one of the new ones at L4, but then
I realized that it wasn’t a station, it was a big ship, a
cruiser. Flipping through the images, I spotted some
familiar design elements. It was one of Exo’s newer

“You ever have one of those moments when you

He chuckled, but it wasn’t a happy laugh. “I really

“Try me,” I said, sounding more confident than I

CONSPIRACIES 
AND CONSPIRACY 
THEORIES

Conspiracies and conspiracy theories are fertile
ground for memeticists. The human need to make
sense of the world allows memetic engineers great leeway
in constructing plausible stories. In addition, the existence
of real conspiracies throughout history make it very diffi-
cult for countermemeticists to argue that a given conspira-
cy doesn’t exist simply because it is highly unlikely. All
too often, unlikely conspiracies have been very real
– many historical conspiracies survived simply
because people in power considered them too farfetched to
investigate.
The human mind is particularly good at seeing struc-
ture and connections, even with a tiny amount of evidence.
This ability was a survival skill earlier in hominid evolu-
tion, but is detrimental in the highly complex mod-
ern world. It’s too easy to “see” relationships and
matches because something “feels” too close for
coincidence. The pastime of watching for shapes
and faces in clouds is a relatively benign example
of this, as are more recent manifestations, such as
observing links between old movies and unrelated
music. Yet these simple examples underscore just
how powerful this part of the brain can be. The
human mind latches on to patterns.
Conspiracy theories are usually political
memes. If they are intentionally constructed, they
are typically intended to shape civil discourse, pol-
icy, and the popular will. Such crafted memes can
be used to sow distrust and cynicism, or to mask a
real conspiracy by making it look like just another
paranoid fantasy. Sometimes, however, such theo-
ries emerge more or less on their own, reflecting a
deep mistrust or fear of leaders, and thriving on
random connections between people and events.
CONSPIRACY DESCRIPTIONS
“Okay, Jack, I’m really confused now.
What does any of this have to do with the pic-
tures you were mailed?” I finished my glass, but
held off on ordering another. I wanted to make
sure I was getting this straight.
“Clark was in those pictures.” He held up
his hand as I tried to interrupt him. “No, I don’t
mean these were old pictures of him. This is a
new ship design. These were new images – I
checked the creation-date mark. They were
taken about a week ago.”
“That’s impossible.” He rolled his eyes.
“Obviously. Are you sure it was him? Not some-
one who looked similar?”
“I had the NAI do a pattern match between
this person and a couple of random pictures of
Clark I pulled off of the Web. Identical, closer
than a twin would be.”
“Wow.” There’s really not a lot to say when
told something like that.
He grinned at me. I didn’t like the look of
it; Jack only grinned like that when he was
about to sucker-punch you. “Guess who was
with him?”
The conspiracies listed here may be real, or
they may be complete fabrications.

CONSPIRACIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES
CONSPIRACY THEORY
Anyone can construct a conspiracy theory. What takes skill
is constructing one that is simultaneously not obvious and hard to
disprove. In 2100, the general access to great amounts of infor-
mation means that it’s easier than ever to find holes in a conspir-
acy story. The slightest flaw – a person not where they were
assumed to be, a company’s ownership being in dispute, a
required piece of technology not being available at the time of the
purported conspiracy, etc. – is easy to spot and counter, often
pulling down the entire conspiracy edifice. This is a double-
edged sword for the theorist. While this makes it a simple task for
a layman to identify and dismiss flawed theories, it also means
that many people interpret theories that can’t be immediately dis-
proved as being highly plausible.
Using the Conspiracy Theory skill (see p. 134) to dissect a
candidate scheme in an age of dense information networks means
knowing where to look to find confirmation or denial of a con-
spiracy’s elements. A poorly constructed theory, such as one
based on random coincidental connections, can be identified as
false in seconds – the GM may give a researcher a large modifi-
er (+6 or more) when dealing with crude “conspiracies.” A more
robust conspiracy story, not easily dismissed by checking the
Web, is treated normally. The GM may also apply a penalty to
attempts to disprove a conspiracy theory constructed to fit espe-
cially with web-accessible information.
Using the Conspiracy Theory skill to create a false-but-
plausible tale is significantly more difficult than in earlier. The
GM may apply a penalty to attempts to build a plausible theory,
reflecting the difficulty of finding story elements that fit widely
available facts. Successes, however, should be noted. The GM
may wish to give a penalty equivalent to the number of points by
which the creator succeeded to any subsequent attempts to dis-
prove the theory.
Using Conspiracy Theory to identify the existence of real
conspiracies certainly takes advantage of the abundant amounts
of information available, but is not necessarily improved by it.
The sheer volume of data means that finding relevant elements
may be more difficult than before. There’s more signal, but a lot
more noise.
Finally, Conspiracy Theory is very useful for real conspira-
tors trying to avoid discovery. A conspirator with sufficient abili-
ty can explore just how visible his conspiracy truly is, and attempt
to plant connected-but-irrelevant data in order to throw investi-
gators off the trail.

In 2100, the meme has declined in credibility
among the general populace, but remains popular
among radical biochauvinists who believe that sapi-
ent programs are conspiring to dominate humani-
ty. Some survivalist groups also hold onto the
meme, believing that an AI cabal has already
dominated Fifth Wave nations’ leaders. This
notion has leapt from deep space survivalists to
a growing number of Earthbound Isolates’ com-
munities. The meme is also found in parts of the Islam-
ic Caliphate and the TSA. Although it is based on a
long-standing meme, its current manifestation shows signs
of construction. It is likely that radical biochauvinist
memeticists continue to tweak the meme to help its ongo-
ing spread.
The mainstream reaction to this theory is that while
domination by an implant-resident infomorph is technical-
ly possible it is highly unlikely. It would require a com-
promised system, a rogue digital entity, and a
weakened host. The theory’s proponents point to the
Teca cult (pp. 27-28) and the Shaoxing tragedy in
2097 to support the argument that it’s more likely
than most people would like to admit. Many then
note that this is just the sort of denial expected if the
world’s leaders had already been compromised.
Emiliano Zapata 
International Aerospaceport
What stands out about the layout of the tunnels
is just how big they are. These are not just simple
corridors running between utility closets; most are
at least five meters wide, and several of them are
more than 10 meters across and 10 meters in
height. Trucks . . . or combat cybershells . . . would
fit easily.
– Marissa Hernandez,
The Secret City, 2085
Constructed in 2068 to handle transatmospher-
ic vehicle traffic, Emiliano Zapata International
(ZAP) is now the largest aerospaceport in Mexico.
Located about 20 miles to the north of Mexico City,
ZAP is known for its unusual architecture, extensive
facilities, and aggressive security. Aerospaceport
officials boast that no terrorist activity has ever been
traced through ZAP, and no violent crime has ever
occurred on the site.
Zapata International would be of interest only to
travelers but for the 2085 publication of The Secret
City, documenting the existence of elaborate networks of
tunnels and chambers beneath the aerospaceport. The
author, Marissa Hernandez, described the construction of
the tunnels and chambers, but could find no official expla-
nation of why they were built. The Secret City was Her-
nandez’ investigation of the project and an exploration
of various theories about its existence.
AI/Mind Control Meme
“A virtual implant? You’ll never catch me get-
ting something like that stuck in my head. Damn AIs
have already taken my job. I don’t want to give ‘em an
unlocked door to my body, too.”
– Overheard, Grand Central Station,
New York, 2098
This meme is one of the various continued fears
about artificial intelligences and brain-related technolo-
gies common in 2100. It holds that rogue SAIs and malev-
olent mind emulations roam the Web and “infect” the
minds of hapless victims through a variety of means –
upslink, cyberswarms, subliminal messages embedded in
virtual advertising, etc. In some variants, the invading AI
only temporarily controls the victim, while others claim
that the victim’s mind is erased and the AI takes total per-
manent control. In most cases the meme shifts from
“urban legend” to “conspiracy” by suggesting that this
ability to infect and control minds was intended by the AI-
systems’ designers.
This meme can be traced back to before SAIs ever
existed. In the 2000s, neo-Luddite activists, aware of the
emerging “singularity” meme, warned that mere humans
would not be able to compete with “superior” digital life
forms. Humanity would eventually be driven to extinction
or absorbed into a supercomputer totality. While this was
an alarming notion, few people in the early 21st century
encountered the meme and fewer still believed it.
The development of both SAIs and virtual-interface-
implant technology gave this meme its first real boost. The
possibility of an AI controlling the human body ceased
being fantasy. Many people wonder since the human brain
can control the computer, what’s to stop the computer from
controlling the brain? Each new development added a
layer of concern. As mind-emulation programs became
more and more common, so did fear that the uploaded
minds of the dead could seek out new bodies to inhabit.
The popular 2069 video drama The Weaver gave the meme
a standard version. The plot used many of the more-
common elements of this meme – a renegade academician
who uses AIs and crude implants to take over the bodies of
students to build a private army.
The meme had its broadest recognition in 2088, dur-
ing the trial of serial killer Niep “Meat Puppet” San. San,
a Thai émigré and Pacific War veteran living in Sydney.
He claimed that he murdered seven women because of a
“TSA black-op AI” that had taken over his mind while he
was indulging in erotic slinkies. Though the court-
appointed memeticist determined that San was suffering
from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, that didn’t stop the
media from bringing in “experts,” usually biochauvinist
activists, to lend credence to his defense. While attention
died down along with the trial’s hype, it still crops up on
the Web from time to time.
CONSPIRACIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES

Although the book enjoyed mild popularity,
with Hernandez appearing on various InVid talk
shows, it quickly faded into obscurity after debunkers
noted a lack of evidence from freely available satellite
imagery and surveying systems. By 2088 The Secret City
was out of print and forgotten, and the suicide of the author
in 2090 was only a footnote. The manuscript appeared des-
tined to be one of the multitudes of marginal conspiracy
publications.
But in 2092 the complete text of The Secret City
appeared on the TSA Web, along with an extensive set of
files from ConMex, a Los Angeles-based corporation and
the primary contractor for Zapata International. The files
included planning documents showing the location of the
tunnels and networks that Hernandez had described. Con-
Mex and ZAP could do little other than file complaints
with the WTO against the TSA.
Conspiracy-oriented memenets and Weltspiel sites
were soon filled with rumors. The major one was that
Marissa Hernandez didn’t commit suicide, she was actual-
ly killed by ConMex or ZAP. Some people added that the
unusual architecture of the main terminal buildings echoed
the look of Mesoamerican temples, and that the layout of
the runways had the rough shape of a swastika. Various
websites have linked ZAP to the Masons, Transhumanist
organizations, and World Tree Enterprises (see p. 52).
ConMex and Zapata International officials have
steadfastly refused to make any comment about the tun-
nels and chambers, Several attempts to investigate their
existence have been stopped by ZAP security. The last,
in 2097, resulted in the deaths of five journalists – the
aerospaceport’s security personnel were subsequently
cleared of wrongdoing by the federal courts. To this day,
the reasons behind the extensive underground network
beneath Zapata International remain a mystery, along
with the identity of whoever posted the book and files to
the TSA Web.
False Leaders
“Have you ever seen the new CEO in person? Nei-
ther have I. Neither has anyone else. All we ever see of
him is when he speaks on vid from wherever he’s sup-
posedly traveling to. I think the board put in a phony to
take the fall over something big. I’m gonna cash out my
options while I still can.”
– Overheard, Jomo Kenyatta Interplanetary
Spaceport, Nairobi, 2099
This theory, which has repeatedly popped up around
the world over the past few decades, suggests that the cur-
rent political leadership – or, less often, a major corporate
entity – is entirely nonexistent. The leader is not real in any
way, including as a ghost, SAI, or any other form of info-
morph. Any pronouncements from this leader are the fab-
rication of a shadowy group behind the throne. Any
appearance alone on camera or with close associates
in on the plot is computer generated. Any appearance
in public is handled by one of his many stand-ins,
which could be human but are more likely puppet
bioshells. Any existence prior to the current position is fab-
ricated and supposed childhood friends either bought-off
or are themselves entirely false as well.
The persistence of this meme is explained in part by
successful historical examples of this ruse. In 2018,
a coup in the republic of Tajikistan brought “Gen-
eral Ahmed Shah” to power. That none of the
Tajik citizens or foreign analysts had heard of
General Ahmed Shah before wasn’t out of line,
given the secretive nature of the Tajik military and
the previous regime. Ahmed Shah appeared occasionally
at public events, but never spoke at them, and gave regular
speeches to his citizens on TV. Only after the 2023 coun-
tercoup did people discover that Ahmed Shah was nothing
more than a photorealistic animation and a couple of look-
alike stand-ins. The real leaders were the army generals
who had publicly denied any desire for political power. In
2036, a group in Sudan tried a similar hoax, that time
unsuccessfully. 
For many, the best-known case of the “false leader”
theory being true was in 2076. Awoman claiming to be the
“Melody Alexander” behind the Alexander Security Asso-
ciates private security group made a number of accusations
against the firm . . . In order to fight the charges, ASA
eventually had to admit that their “Melody Alexander” was
not a real person. Her various appearances had only been
NAI animations and a stand-in employee.
This conspiracy theory is fairly hard to justify in rela-
tively open and transparent societies, where various public
records can easily establish identities. In these regions, the
supposedly false leaders are typically foreigner heads of
businesses. That said, the abundance of entirely virtual
organizations means that many, if not most, employees
have never actually seen their bosses in person, making the
meme hard to entirely dismiss. In more closed societies,
this meme is much easier to believe, as there may be little
way for a normal citizen to verify the official biographies
of elites. The “false leader” meme is particularly virulent
in failed, war-torn states or those under the thumb of a
reclusive dictator, such as Iran and Kazakstan.

groups are fiercely antiparahuman and antibioroid, but
articulate their bias as a call to defend Earth and humanity
from outside influence.
Bioengineering firms have stymied all attempts to
access parahuman and bioroid genome – the companies
aggressively defend their intellectual property. In 2097,
one meme supporter set up a site on the TSA Web using
genemaps pirated by the nanosocialists as the basis of his
argument. According to his analysis, a couple of gene seg-
ments that seem to have no parallel in the baseline
human genome appear in every known parahuman
design. Most experts who have examined this evi-
dence observe that this is most likely the carrier for
the genetic-rights-management licenses. Bioengi-
neering-design companies willing to speak about the
site typically claim that these are copying errors introduced
by the TSA pirates.
Most media outlets that deal in paranormal, occult,
fringe beliefs, or conspiracy theories have done something
with this meme. At present it is a staple of horror fiction,
including the very successful French InVid show, The
Majestic World. The heroes of the program, parahuman
Adrienne Calvert and baseline human Jean Aster, fight the
genomic invasion as special operatives of the Genetic Reg-
ulatory Agency. Meme believers dismiss the show as sheer
fantasy, but watch it religiously. The meme appears to be
naturally occurring and continues largely without inten-
tional propagation.

“Adrienne, admit it: there is no other choice.
You have seen the voidmasters with your own eyes, seen
their plans for humankind. You carry their mark in your
cells. Which will you be – their slave or their execu-

– Jean Aster, The Majestic World,
Episode 21, “Autumn”
Most often found in Europe, Latin America, and
South Asia, this meme holds that aliens reached Earth
decades ago – normally, the 1950’s are the first contact
period – and are working to transform humanity into a
completely different species. Aliens are the hidden powers
behind biotechnological developments, especially those
coming from the American biotech industries. The various
parahuman designs were created to allow new alien-
human hybrids to live openly in society. The final goal is
either to evolve humanity into superbeings, to replace
humanity with the neo-aliens, or to turn all humans into
bioroid pod people, depending on the meme variant.
Versions of this meme have existed since the latter
20th century. They ascribe alien origins to whichever new
technologies have caught the public’s attention, including
nuclear weapons, microprocessors, fusion power, and arti-
ficial intelligence. The latest iteration, focusing on human
germline engineering, first appeared in the 2040s. In 2094,
a new variant appeared, claiming that aliens provided nan-
otechnology, but this has not yet replaced the genomic
variant.
Although most people dismiss the meme as a joke,
among some very small fringe groups it is gospel. These

CONSPIRACIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES
The nation of Kazakstan is ruled with an iron fist by the
dictator Sergey Zarubayev – iron fist being almost literal.
Zarubayev spent much of the 21st century altering his body
with cybernetic implants and limbs. Although most of his
reign has been characterized by brutal physical atrocities and
relentless political oppression, the later decades of the 2100’s
have seen particularly twisted sort of memetic torture.
Zarubayev’s Minister of the Mind and Body, Nikolai
Verkovenskii, uses Kazakstan’s capital, Alma-Ata, as his lab-
oratory for experiments with the relationship between per-
ception of reality and social control. (For more detail on
Zarubayev’s dictatorship, see the Alma-Ata section
of Transhuman Space: Broken Dreams, 
pp. BD104-114.)
Verkovenskii has a bizarre fascina-
tion with manipulating of an indivi-
dual’s sense of reality. He has carefully
studied past totalitarian regimes, con-
cluding that the best way to shape a
society is to control what it knows.
His experiments along these lines
have run the gamut from the 
subtle to the horrific.
Government-controlled
video displays are impossible to
avoid, appearing on street corners,
inside businesses and government
offices, and in all manner of public
transit. They are mandatory in
nearly every home. All show the
same channel, the only one available
in Kazakstan, and cannot be turned
off or muted. The programming is
entirely controlled by the Ministry and
Verkovenskii.
Verkovenskii has perfected, through the
use of remote-controlled implanted augment-
ed-reality systems, making victims see things that
are not real or hiding things that are. Calling attention to
bizarre sights that others cannot see is a guaranteed way of
being arrested, so Kazak citizens avoid reacting to even the
most outlandish or disturbing sights. The person screaming
while rolling around on the ground may be seconds away
from being arrested, or may be entirely illusory . . . Either
way, it’s best to ignore him.
The existence of this twisted memetic torture has given
life to even more bizarre rumors. A common tale is that the
Ministry has perfected a technique to replicate a biological
brain in both form and content, so that clones can have
identical minds without having to resort to infomorphs.
Related to this concept are rumors of kidnapped individuals
having their brains replaced by a replicated brain of
Zarubayev. No test for implanted computers would reveal
that it was an entirely new brain.
Strange rumors about Kazakstan and the Ministry
abound all along the nation’s borders. It is an article of faith
in Uzbekistan that Zarubayev’s regime has replaced numer-
ous Uzbek officials with bioroid duplicates controlled from
Alma-Ata. The only way to tell one of these bioroids apart
from a regular human is that they have two hearts. In Rus-
sia, ostensibly an ally of Kazakstan, it is widely
believed that Kazakstan uses border guards that
are the bioengineered offspring of humans and
wolves.
At a somewhat more believable level,
stories abound on Weltspiel sites and
political memenets about collusion
between Zarubayev’s government and
other nations and political entities.
China exports its dissidents to Kazak-
stan for “education and rehabilita-
tion.” The United States is making
secret payments to Verkovenskii in
exchange for his cutting-edge
memetic research – and this infor-
mation is passed along to the major
advertising corporations. Kazakstan
is actually a puppet of Russia, a test-
ing ground for new control tech-
niques. Or the Kremlin is firmly in
Zarubayev’s grip, and has been for
decades.
Even more plausible and troubling are
the rumored associations between Kazak-
stan and various off world groups. The
Baikonur space facility in Kazakstan, a remnant
of the state’s former role as a Soviet Socialist Repub-
lic, is one of the more active launch centers on Earth. Inter-
national agencies are not allowed to inspect goods
transported via Baikonur, and many believe that the facility
is a primary transit point for smugglers. The surprisingly high
levels of technology found in the Kazak government – Dr.
Verkovenskii’s primary assistant is an SAI-9 residing in a
bush robot, for example – can be traced to developers and
illegal operations in the Main Belt. There is every reason to
believe that the research data produced by the Ministry of
Mind and Body has found its way to criminal and terrorist
groups across the solar system.
THE MINISTRY OF MIND AND BODY

wants to remake human civilization to be an ideal-
ized version of modern Europe.
Whether the rest of humanity would go along with this
is irrelevant – by definition, the rest of humanity is too
short-sighted to see its real interests clearly. 
The LOGOS Conspiracy
“Memetic theory provides the perfect defense for
the memetic conspiracy: all beliefs are contingent, all
knowledge is constructed. The notion of memes-as-
conspiracy can be dissected, torn apart by those who
deny its truth, made to appear as meaningless as any
other ideology or religion.”
– From the Tri-L recruitment website
This meme carries the belief that memetics is the con-
spiracy! Meme theory developed long before LOGOS, or
even any AIs, emerged, but only with the advanced capa-
bilities of SAIs has the field become so influential. In the
handful of years since the development of modern meme-
tic science, much of human communication, diplomacy,
and even psychiatric therapy have started to use memetic
concepts . . . tossing out centuries of human-devised
approaches. Memetics is coloring much of how
humankind sees the world and civilization. One result of
this shift in perception is that the notion of “truth” – long
the basis for most faiths – is itself a cognitive construct.
This conspiracy’s foundation lies with the creation of
LOGOS in 2066, but solidified in 2078 after the SAI com-
pleted The Propagation of Human Ideas. There is much
overlap with the believers of other conspiracies, though
some hold that the conspiracy goes up to the creators of
LOGOS, who are likely aliens, military-industrial inter-
ests, or even the Illuminati. Debates are heated, though all
agree that LOGOS and other SAIs are the key and the per-
fect means to subjugate the human mind.
Believers in this meme often quote the Pope’s 2079
reaction to the publication of PHI: “When people stop
believing in truth, then all they have left to believe in are
lies.” Memetics, in their view, has weakened human soci-
ety from the inside. Only something bent on domination
would need to create something as insidious and subver-
sive as memetics. Adherents to this conspiracy use terms
like “mind control” and “pacification” interchangeably
with “memetics.”
Unlike many believers in other conspiracy theories,
cells of a group calling themselves the “Liberators of the
LOGOS Legacy” are not satisfied with simply document-
ing accounts that support their claims. The Tri-Ls, as they
are known, actively conduct hostile web actions against
SAIs and their supporters. They have committed acts of
physical violence against facilities specializing in creating
SAIs in the U.S., E.U., and Japan. Tri-L memetic engineers
are likely responsible for the continued widespread 
propagation of this meme.
Langzeitgesellschaft
“A hundred years ago, thinking ‘long term’
meant thinking about the next five years. Some 50 years
ago, it meant thinking about the next 20 years. Today,
we are told to think about the next century. I would
argue that even that is painfully short sighted. With the
technology at our fingertips, we could live for millennia
– 100 years is but a blink of the eye.”
– Marie Gustav, Long-View Report 2089
The possibility of living immensely long lives via
ghosting or other technologies is a double-edged sword.
Those who currently hold power and influence simply by
not dying will likely maintain that position for far longer
than ever before, perhaps even further consolidating their
hold. But the certainty of continued existence for even cen-
turies means that plots and intrigues have far more time to
unfold. From this latter perspective, victory goes not to he
who holds power now, but to he who is able to plan for a
longer campaign.
Langzeitgesellschaft (LZG) is an advisory group ded-
icated to the promotion of long-term thinking. Based in
Vienna, LZG was founded originally in 2043 as a center
for developing techniques for very-long-term planning.
Consulting with LZG was a business fad in the 2050s, but
the group’s fame soon faded. Since around 2060, LZG has
maintained a quiet existence, publishing an annual trend
study called the Long-View Report, and occasionally con-
sulting with large businesses and government agencies.
LZG members, about 100 strategic planners and memeti-
cists, exclusively comprise SAIs, ghosts, and people with
anti-aging biomods, almost all European.
This consulting work is largely a front. Langzeitge-
sellschaft partners have slowly developed plans to extend
the organization’s reach, with an ultimate goal of having
political dominance over human space within the 1,000
years. Careful investments, cautious behind-the-scenes
promotion of various political and ideological groups, and
a subtle memetic-engineering campaign all combine to
gradually build their influence. For at least the last three
decades, the advice it has provided to corporations and
government bodies has included seemingly innocuous ele-
ments that further advance this agenda. LZG has no mili-
tary force, no coercive might of its own – all of its power
comes from its supposed ability to influence the present in
ways that lead to its desired future.
This plot has little to do with power and much to do
with foresight. LZG members firmly believe that the
human family, including SAIs, is too driven by short-term
considerations to construct a long-lasting civilization.
Without farsighted leaders, the next 10,000 years of human
existence are likely to be a series of conflicts, retreats to the
edge of chaos, and slow reconstruction. LZG wishes
instead for humanity to perennial social harmony, sustain-
able technology, and political wisdom. In short, it

LOGOS denies any such

it admit the fact, if it were

CONSPIRACIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES
CONSPIRACIES AS POP CULTURE
Beyond their reflection of cultural anxieties and concerns, conspiracies are enter-
taining to think about. It is a well-understood principle of storytelling that most audi-
ences like to have cause and effect wrapped up neatly over the course of the tale.
Unconnected random events, unresolved elements, and a general sense that “stuff
happens” make for unsatisfying, albeit realistic, plots. In addition, despite all contrary
evidence, most audiences like to believe that people of authority know what they are
doing and have the power to bend events to their will. Stories about government con-
spiracies reassure the audience that even if they are evil, at least the leaders are com-
petent.
Several pieces of conspiracy-related media are popular cultural artifacts in 2100.
Devil’s Advocate
A slink log (“slog”) that first showed up in 2096, Devil’s Advocate initially
appeared to be the ramblings of a smart but paranoid former nuclear engineer only
called “Mike,” somewhere in Australia. The slog has developed a substantial cult fol-
lowing over the last few years, however, as he began to piece together his evidence
for a system-spanning conspiracy involving proof of alien life, nanosocialist presence
in governments around the world, and the emergence of super-intelligent rogue AIs.
(He claims that the proto-black hole is not alien, but is being used to distract us from
the real artifacts.) Mike’s real talent is his ability to spin together ludicrous elements
into a conspiratorial whole that is, for most of his downslinkers, very compelling.
Nobody is quite sure how much of what Mike talks about is real, how much is entire-
ly made up, and how much is fortuitous coincidence when a news report later con-
firms a small piece of his overall paranoid design.
Ein Berliner
In late 2098, the popular serial webdrama, Ein Berliner, took a turn for the bizarre
when the main character, Rudolf Schroeder, discovered that his virtual-interface
implant was being tapped, and that his trusted SAI ally, Jaeger, was complicit in the
violation. Over the course of the 2099 storyline, Schroeder’s investigation of just who
or what had been spying on him revealed the existence of a massive conspiracy
involving branches of the E.U., a cabal of rogue SAIs, and his own daughter, Stella.
The show’s fans were shocked and upset about the sudden shift from romantic drama
to conspiracy paranoia. However, the show’s producer, Michel Mariotti, claimed that
this had been the story all along, and that hints were present during the first 50
“romantic” episodes. During the show’s fall hiatus, fan memenets have been furious-
ly exchanging information about clues discovered in earlier shows, and waiting impa-
tiently for the next set of episodes, due to begin in January.
The Martian Candidate
Based on the classic 1962 movie The Manchurian Candidate, the InVid release
The Martian Candidate tells the story of Fang Li, a soldier in the Chinese army dur-
ing the Pacific War, captured along with his squad by the TSA. He is then implanted
with a puppet system, able to take over his mind upon receiving a trigger signal from
a nanosocialist operative. The squad is brainwashed to remove memories of the cap-
ture, and released near Chinese-held areas to ensure “rescue.” Years later, Fang and
his best friend from the squad have moved to Mars, living in the Rust China settle-
ment, and under surreptitious watch of his new wife, who is (unbeknownst to him) a
TSA agent. When a hardline antinanosocialist candidate for the Chinese presidency
makes a stop in New Shanghai, Fang’s implant is activated – he must assassinate the
politician. But just who does his best friend really work for?

and 
DB51).
These smaller exam-
ples of xoxing and
ghost collection are
often cited as evi-
dence that xox theft

ing frequency. Over
half of the U.S. and
Chinese populations
believe that it is
“somewhat likely”
that a xox repository
of the scale of the
Necropolis exists.
Europeans are less
likely to believe the
meme, while over two-
thirds of its off-world citizens accept it. The meme got
another boost in 2098, when the Washington Eye reported
a leak of Executive Order 2097-11A, authorizing the
Secret Service to perform emergency ghostings of top
officials if they die during a national emergency or terror-
ist attack, regardless of the individual’s wishes. The White
House issued a denial of the directive’s existence.
Cognitive ecologists currently believe that the
Necropolis meme was an engineered meme that went
feral, and that The Exogenesis Solution InVid was intend-
ed as part of an abortive campaign against the corporation.
Fragmentary evidence suggests that Xiao Chu may have
played a role in the construction of this meme. The truth
may never be known, as the producer of the InVid, Kelly
Wu, died in a Pacific War-related accident in 2084.
dead. While its existence has never been demonstrated,
millions of people around the world believe that it is
likely to exist.
The most-common version of the Necropolis meme
claims that anyone who dies in a modern hospital is sub-
jected to an immediate ghosting and the mind emulation is
then stored in a massive repository, waiting for reanima-
tion. What people think is being done with these copies is
never clear. Suggestions range from use in experiments to
create a superintelligent AI, information extraction, temp-
orary storage, or waiting until after a certain eschatological
event – the Singularity, the Second Coming, the Revolu-
tion – to be brought back to life again. In most versions of
the Necropolis meme, the millions of mind emulations it
holds are kept inactive; in some, they are awake and aware
of what’s happening to them. In different versions of the
story, a particular government, a cabal of governments,
Exogenesis, or even a cadre of rogue AIs operates the
Necropolis.
While versions of this idea have appeared in specula-
tive fiction for well over a century, the first modern articu-
lation was in the independently produced “documentary”
InVid The Exogenesis Solution, in 2080. While the InVid
only claimed that certain public figures were being ghost-
ed upon death, the idea took on a life of its own, evolving
into multiple variant memes. The story has enough staying
power that in the U.S. election of 2096 one Senator ran on
a platform that included “exposing any CIA Necropolis
efforts.”
Despite the lack of any supporting evidence, the
notion that people are being xoxed after they die remains
widespread. Sporadic illegal xoxes of celebrities serve to
reinforce the notion . . . as do reports of a trading post for
illegal xoxes, the so-called “Valhalla Facility” on Callisto

Onos
“Do you think it was sheer coincidence that
Homo sapiens started its rise to supremacy only after
its various competitors were finally killed off, leaving it
as the sole hominid species?”
– Posted to the Onos discussion network,
2098. The posting was removed within
three minutes.
Onos is a small but quickly growing organization,
with members in most nations and a foothold on nearly all
of the major colonized planets and moons. It has two sides,
a public front that appears to be a
debating society focusing on
issues 
of 
transhumanity’s
future, and an inner circle with
a far more radical agenda. This
core group plots direct action to
further the organization’s true
goals. Fortunately for every-
one, the inner circle is obsessed
with threats from within.
In its public form, Onos
members 
debate 
genetic
enhancements and their rela-
tive merit, as well as examining
cutting-edge biotechnologies
for life extension and the like.
An ongoing discussion is the
group’s attempt to find the best traits for a true “Ideal
Parahuman” type. The Herakles series (see p. FW116) is
favored by many, although the Ziusudra (see p. TS118) is
a close second. Onos recently started publishing Tomor-
row’s Cradle Quarterly, a competitor to the venerable
Posthuman Consumer Review. This public discussion
forum is quite lively, and is considered a success.
The secret side of Onos is much more sinister. Onos
is supposedly named after its founder, but in reality the
name stands for the phrase “One Niche, One Species.”
Its members believe that the current radiative expansion
of posthuman types will be a very temporary event, like
the Cambrian explosion, and that in the long term there
can be only one sapient tool-and-language-using species
in the system. They expect a collapse, a mass-extinction
event brought on by competition among the candidates
to be Homo sapiens’ evolutionary successor, and intend
for themselves or their descendants to be the ones left
standing.
The inner council is increasingly of the opinion that if
the war for the destiny of intelligent life is not fought very
soon that the growing numbers of infomorphs will tip the
balance in the AIs’ favor. Onos predicts that the winners
will at first be dominated by ghosts, and will thus claim to
be pursuing the human destiny . . . But soon after their 
victory against biological life, amoral self-improving
SAI infomorphs will turn on their posthuman allies
and wipe them out. Thus, Onos schemes to bring the
war to a head now, while the balance still leans in the favor
of human-derived biological life.
Onos’ inner circle is a small group, numbering about
30, but controls substantial wealth, as most were born into
prestige as highly advanced parahumans. Most core group
business is handled by telepresence, but the current inner
circle chair, Viktor Malavides, prefers to have the core
members meet in person every quarter so as to avoid pos-
sible compromises of their communication networks.
Malavides has a flair for the dramatic, and uses a family
castle in Austria for the meetings.
Onos’ secret plans are elaborate. Their current agenda
is to engage in a wide array of memetic activities designed
to increase racial tensions between parahuman variants,
always with as much deniability and distance as possible.
Their longer-term designs include bringing about a gener-
al war between the world powers as a trigger for the
intended pogrom against infomorph life. 
However, although they are rich, Onos’ inner circle
does not yet have the political or memetic expertise to
carry out their overall plans. As of 2100, their attempts to
craft memetic campaigns have been clumsy, and they were
very nearly exposed in late 2099. Their idea of kicking off
a global war in order to go after infomorphs is fairly neb-
ulous, and they are aware that it is for now unrealistic. The
members of the Onos inner circle is perpetually focused on
possible “spies” and “provocateurs” in their midst, and
spend much of their time and money engaged in investi-
gations of and dirty tricks against other core members.
Shadow Government
“Among the disturbing questions arising from this
revelation is just what would happen should the ‘shad-
ow government’ wake up while the real government is
still in power? Would they willingly go back to sleep?
Or would they try to take over?”

appearing as part of a variant LOGOS Conspiracy
meme (see p. 47). In different forms, the shadow-gov-
ernment meme has been around for nearly 70 years, usual-
ly involving technology several steps beyond that which
actually exists. (The original form of the meme, dat-
ing back to the 2020s, claimed that the president
and vice-president had been cloned with their
memories intact.)
Among those still giving it any attention at all,
the meme gained some credibility in 2096 when the
“Watkins Report” was leaked. The report, written by an
anonymous aide to Jim Watkins, a four-term Republican
from Alabama, contained references to a memo discussing
disaster-recovery scenarios, including the possibility of
having shadows made of key political figures. The report
convinced several fringe journalists that there might be
truth to the meme after all, but its long history leads most
people to discount it without considering recent evidence.
The incoming administration claimed that there was
no evidence that the memo was real. However, the 2098
leak of Executive Order 2097-11A, authorizing the Secret
Service to create ghosts of any leader killed in a national
emergency, is widely thought to be refinement of the con-
cept. The meme has also spread beyond the United States.
Rumors claim that it has inspired China’s government to
consider whether a shadow government could be useful,
and that research is currently under way in Beijing.
According to the 2089 InVid documentary, The
Omaha Project, the U.S. Secret Service has created
advanced shadows of powerful individuals in the U.S.
government, including the president, vice-president, high-
ranking cabinet members, and several Joint Chiefs. These
shadows are stored in a compound in Omaha, where they
are constantly fed information on the state of the country.
Should a disaster ever befall the real government, this
“shadow government” could be brought in as a replace-
ment within hours.
The documentary, which featured elaborate “dramati-
zations” and anonymous interviews with supposed gov-
ernment officials, gained fleeting notoriety as it was
apparently subject to repeated attempts to shut down any
presentation. When these attempts were traced back to the
InVid’s own producers and it turned out they were a
memetic campaign to gain attention, interest quickly dissi-
pated. The documentary is widely thought a hoax,
although it remains popular with American citizens para-
noid about government control and the growth of sapient-
rights groups.
Genuine belief in the shadow-government meme is
virtually nonexistent outside those circles. Anyone with a
casual interest in government conspiracy theories is likely
familiar with it, however – though details vary, such as the
individuals shadowed and the location of the compound.
The meme often latches onto other similar ideas, often

World Tree Enterprises
“Ah, yes, World Tree Enterprises.
It’s mysterious, it’s powerful, and it goes
out of its way to use mystical symbolism and
terminology. My guess is that the founder just
wanted to give conspiracy theorists something big to
chew on while he used his other, less notable, compa-
nies to take over the world.”
– Comment on Luminous, a Weltspiel site
dedicated to conspiracies, 2096
While paranoid fears about AIs and xoxing derive
from modern technologies, some older and more tradition-
al conspiracy memes remain influential. One especially
popular conspiracy theory that has existed in countless
variations for centuries is that of the Secret Masters of the
World – a group of people (or beings) that rules all of Earth
from behind the scenes. This belief stays constant, but the
group allegedly behind it all changes over time, from the
Bavarian Illuminati to the New World Order to little gray
aliens in UFOs. In 2100, a new contender for the title
Secret Master has emerged – World Tree Enterprises.
Certainly, World Tree Enterprises seems to be an odd
company even from a rational perspective. It first stepped
into the limelight in 2089, when it announced plans to cre-
ate the Sepiroth Arcology Complex as its headquarters in
Gabon, and apparently had both the funds and the support
of the local government to do so. The arcology complex
has expanded rapidly since then, and the fourth and final
arcology will be completed in 2101.
The main business of WTE seems to be corporate
raiding – they buy stock in failing or vulnerable 
companies until they control them, and then disman-
tle them and sell off the parts. Sometimes promising
departments are kept by WTE and continue to operate
under their old company name – which serves to obfuscate
the true extend of the WTE corporate family from the
casual observer. In recent years, as the arcologies near
completion and are occupied, WTE has also started a num-
ber of businesses under its own name, all of them based
primarily in Gabon. These focus mainly on high-tech
research, consulting for Third Wave governments and
nations, and “regional peacekeeping” (read: soldiers-for-
hire) in Western Africa – something that has drawn occa-
sional criticism from the South African Coalition.
Also noteworthy is the unusual management structure
of WTE. The nominal CEO and majority shareholder is
one Jonathan Kenzak . . . but apparently he hasn’t been
directly involved in the day-to-day management of WTE
for five years now and nobody has seen him in public
since 2098. The actual top-level management is done
by four powerful SAIs named Gabriel, Uriel,
Raphael, and Michael. Below them are the
Numina, a unique type of bioroid that serve as
low- to mid-level managers, maintenance
workers, and service providers. WTE also
employs many nonbioroid sapients as special-
ists, designers, soldiers, and other positions
where experience and a unique perspective are
important. They are generally paid very well, but few
are in any position of authority.

While the economic empire and the political influ-
ence of WTE are indeed large, they aren’t even close to
what would be required to be the Secret Master of the
World. As for the many nods to occultism, these stem
from the peculiar sense of humor of the company’s
founder. And as it happens, Jonathan Kenzak was a bril-
liant corporate raider who managed to create WTE most-
ly through his own efforts – and the competent advice
and assistance of his AI advisors, which served as ances-
tor code for the Sepiroth SAIs. 
Kenzak was also something of a skeptic about Tran-
shumanism, and thought that struggles between humans
and posthumans would soon consume Fifth Wave
nations. By creating a stable, functional society in a rela-
tively out-of-the-way place, Kenzak hoped to ride out the
coming conflict and be in a position to influence the
shape of post-war Earth. Kenzak didn’t attempt to make
this war any more or less likely, he simply sought to
avoid its ravages.
However, in one case the conspiracy theorists come
close to the truth (see p. 54). Jonathan Kenzak died in
2098, in a plane crash which the SAIs hushed up. The
SAIs were programmed to obey only Kenzak, and this
event effectively made them rogues. They pretend that he
is still alive, and maintain look-alike bioshells controlled
by Kenzak’s shadows. They only let other people visit
“Kenzak” under controlled conditions to maintain the
illusion.
The four SAIs have distinct personalities, and
haven’t yet been able to agree on a common agenda for
WTE beyond “holding true to Kenzak’s vision.” As each
SAI has a slightly different interpretation of that vision,
they only agreed to try increasing their political and eco-
nomic influence until they can find a consensus. In the
meantime, each SAI runs several divisions of WTE as its
private kingdom. While the four remain on relatively
good terms with each other, tension is growing. Two of
the SAIs, Gabriel and Raphael, believe that Kenzak
would have tried to expand WTE’s holdings beyond
Gabon once the work there was completed. Uriel
believes that Kenzak would have sought out potential
acquisition targets in positions to influence a postwar
economic environment. And the last, Michael, believes
that Kenzak would have turned to building up the mili-
tary capabilities of WTE and Gabon in order to fend off
any attacks coming as part of the overall war.
The corporate citizens of WTE, bioroids and non-
bioroids alike, continue to do their jobs without realizing
how volatile their home has become.

The Numina-series bioroids serve as a “buffer”
between the other sapient employees of World Tree
Enterprises. They do all the boring clerical work and rou-
tine maintenance jobs so that the highly paid specialists
can concentrate on what they do best.
Extremely social, the Numinas are programmed
with a large range of personality types, individual prefer-
ences, and interests, as well as vastly different appear-
ances. Their charming and outgoing personalities mean
that all but the most antisocial or antibioroid employees
gain a few bioroid friends soon after arriving at the
Sepiroth Arcology Complex. More than one observer has
remarked that the Numina seem to be almost “more
human in personality than most actual humans!” All this
means that employee satisfaction at WTE is far higher
than at most other companies. 
THE TRUTH ABOUT WORLD TREE ENTERPRISES

WTE works closely with the government of
Gabon, and has set up a mutually beneficial rela-
tionship. Whatever WTE wants, within reason, the gov-
ernment gives them. In exchange, WTE has sponsored
many programs that have increased education
standards and infrastructure significantly in
many regions of Gabon.
These are the known facts about WTE.
What isn’t known about the company is filled
in by tons of conspiracy theories. The tamest
ones revolve around the CEO. At one point
Kenzak was the heir to a large family fortune –
but this fortune was nowhere near enough for
building a company the size of WTE. So just
who gave him the money to build all this?
Some people also speculate that he hasn’t only
retired from active management – he has died,
and now the SAIs, which might have killed
him, have taken over the company. (see p. 53)
They in turn create more and more bioroid ser-
vants for their sinister agendas.
Others wonder just how large the WTE
empire is and what the leadership, whoever or
whatever they might be, intends to do with it.
Do they just want to be one corporate empire
among many? Or do they plan to be a power
broker in West Africa and other Third Wave
regions and shape whole nations in a way that
pleases them? Are their corporate raiding prac-
tices so successful that they have taken over a
large portion of the Earth’s economy already?
Finally, the Sepiroth Arcology Complex
also provokes some interesting questions.
Many notice that it lies directly on the equator.
Does WTE plan to use it as a base station for
another beanstalk elevator to rival the Olympus
Project in Kenya? Many have made comments
on the frequent use of names derived from Kab-
balistic occultism, For example, the four arcologies are
called Assiah, Yetzirah, Briah, and the yet uncompleted
Atziluth. Its peacekeeping operations fall under the
Roêlêd Division, its entire intelligence gathering is done
by the Kumeatêl Department, and its agribusiness con-
cerns are unified under the name Harpax Agriculture.
And the large parkland at the center between the four
arcologies is called Malkuth Gardens. Some fringe con-
spiracy theorists claim to have analyzed the building
plans, as far as they are known, and concluded that the
whole Sepiroth complex is a gargantuan focus for occult
energies and predict that once a beanstalk elevator con-
nects to it, it will become the true Tree of Life.
While many economic and political analysts watch
WTE with interest, only a small lunatic fringe believes
everything they hear about the company. Many more
treat it as a big joke, similar to the Men in Black and
crop circles of the 20th century. They make up even
more lunatic theories as an intellectual exercise,
which are promptly treated as real by others. In addi-
tion, some analysts have noted that WTE’s competitors
may be behind the continued propagation of the 
conspiracy memes.
“I don’t know – little green men?” I started
another shochu. At this point, I half-expected him
to say it was my ex-wife.
“Close. They were gray.”
I put my glass back down. “Oh, please. 
Gray aliens? Isn’t that a bit dated?”
This had gone from the bizarre to the ridiculous.
“Look, you can believe me or not. I don’t
really care at this point. The last set of pictures
had Clark and some military guys floating next to
a group of short, gray, people – things, whatever
– with big heads and solid black eyes. They
looked like they were discussing something. I
realized that the set of images were all someone’s
image record of some event. A big event, I guess.”
“So finding the black hole in Shezbeth made
aliens come and visit, and they caused Clark to
appear to die in office so that they could run off
with him, but he’s back now, or at least he was a
week ago. Do I have that straight?”
He nodded. “The real problem came later
that day. I got an urgent message telling me not
to open the image files, to delete that mail entire-
ly. I didn’t reply immediately. About five minutes
later I get a voice buzz telling me that the repair
tech was here to fix my faulty implant.” Jack
looked pale. “I don’t have a faulty implant. I do
have an implant that received the wrong files.”
“What did you do?”
“Slipped out the back, took off. Spent a few
days with some friends. Got one of them to call
you to set up this meeting.” He handed me a small
data slip. “I need you to hold this for me until I say I
need it.”
He finished off his last drink, looked around. “Man,

CONSPIRACIES AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES

I do hope you will be the person God is going to use to
rescue my family and me. I have deposited the sum of
$350 million dollars in a security firm abroad whose
name is withheld for security reasons until we fully
commence communication. I shall be grateful if you
could receive this fund on my behalf for safekeeping.
Adequate arrangement has been made for receiving the
fund. It is totally risk free. Only you, my attorney, and
me know of this arrangement. This means that my
lawyer will deal directly with you as surveillance is on
me. My lawyer’s name is Mr. Ahmad Adamu. Please
send your response to ahmadadamu@anonymail.biz. 
You are entitled to 30% of the total sum. I hope to
invest a portion of the balance in your country. Please
forward your private contact information so that we
can communicate further immediately. I will be quite
appreciative if you accept my proposal in good faith. I
look forward to receiving your urgent reply to my plea.
Yours truly,

Following the August 2085 death of my husband –
the late General Vu Sanh, former head of state of the
People’s Republic of Thailand – I have been thrown
into a state of utter confusion, frustration, and hope-
lessness by the present Chinese-controlled royalist
administration. Security agents in Thailand have sub-
jected me to physical and psychological tortures. I
managed to escape this persecution, along with my
remaining children, and have traveled incognito for the
last several years, trying to evade capture.
You must have heard over the media and the Web
about the recovery of huge sums of money deposited by
my late husband in different security firms abroad. In
fact the total sum discovered by the government so far
is approximately $700 million dollars. The government
has not relented in its efforts to bring my children and
myself back to Thailand to face show trials. This is why
I deemed it necessary to act fast by contacting a trust-
ed person abroad for assistance.

URBAN
LEGENDS 
AND THE 
PARANORMAL

Not all memes are as complex as cults, movements,
and conspiracies – many are far simpler. Urban legends
and belief in the paranormal rarely become elaborately
structured memeplexes, but still carry a great deal of social
weight. People accept memes like these not because they
give their lives meaning, but because they make life inter-
esting in ways easily understood.
Both urban legends and paranormal beliefs take
advantage of a common human desire to know the
“real” story that differs from the “official” one.
Proof is secondary to the acceptance of memes like
these, as those in power are always able to construct or
suppress evidence as needed. What matters more is
whether the story feels right, fits in with the way the world
seems to or should work.
For memetic engineers, urban legends and stories of
the paranormal post both a challenge and an opportunity.
The broad access to information most people have means
that it’s very easy to find confirmation or denial of the ele-
ments of a constructed myth or ghost story. But the ease
with which the stories are dismissed means that there are
many people hungry for good stories to explain the world
or confirm their feelings. If the memes can be made robust
enough to withstand cursory verification, they’re well on
the way to becoming a widespread belief.
URBAN LEGENDS
Urban legends are a testament to the mind’s ability to
mistake appealing plausibility for reality. Lack of evi-
dence or contrary evidence matters little when the story
told explains things really well or reveals the “truth”
about a particular person, group, object, or idea. “It
makes so much sense, it must be true” is a hallmark reac-
tion to urban legends.
Unfortunately, most aren’t . . . although many contain
enough truth to make them devilishly hard to eradicate. In
general, urban legends are characterized by hard-to-trace
origins, rapid spread, mutability, and occasional horrific
elements. These are often combined with a crude sense of
justice for those who defy social convention. Not inciden-
tally, urban legends are nearly always compelling stories,
able to capture the attention of the listener and memorable
enough to pass on. Urban legends are among the memes
likely to be propagated by people who do not accept them
but still find them interesting enough to spread.
The rise of memetic science has been both a blessing
and curse for urban legends. In general, people aware of
memetic concepts are less apt to accept plausible, satis-
fying, but unproven stories. Conversely, memetic-engi-
neering techniques have allowed those spreading such
legends to create some impossible-to-ignore myths about
the people, organizations, technologies, and ideologies of
the modern era.
URBAN LEGEND DESCRIPTIONS
Urban legends are, as a rule, fairly malleable and often
take on novel elements to better fit their cognitive envi-
ronment. The memes listed here are the commonplace ver-
sions, but all have varieties that better suit a given believer.
AI Transcendence
“You’ve got to listen to me! Elementary chaos the-
ory tells us that all robots will eventually turn against
their masters and run amok in an orgy of blood and the
kicking and the biting with the metal teeth and the 
hurting and shoving.”
– Professor Frink, The Simpsons, 1994
Although many biosapients work with and for sapient
AIs, an undercurrent of mistrust remains. Ironically, it’s the
relative lack of difference between human intellect and
SAI intellect, despite SAIs residing on increasingly sophis-
ticated hardware, which worries some people. Why aren’t
SAIs smarter than humans?

infomorph intelligence has already taken place but that for
a variety of reasons, some good and some ill, SAIs con-
tinue to behave as if they have no real advantage over

primitive version of the technology, which could not
record preexisting memories but could capture an
image of a functional human brain, was used in the 
earliest “SAI” creations.
Some meme believers regard SAIs with disgust, and
call them “changelings” after the legends of faeries that
stole babies and left an inhuman “child” in their place.
Others use this belief to justify treating individual SAIs as
people while being adamantly opposed to the creation of
any more. Despite the vast quantities of research and doc-
umentation on the differences between the thought
processes of ghost infomorphs and SAIs, this legend is
persistent, especially among biochauvinists and 
general technophobes.
Although this meme is not widely accepted, its
core element has a slim connection to reality. A2098
study by the University of Alberta identified two
known and highly unethical uses of the infant-
brainpeeling method in separate programs. A cell of
Red Duncanites on 2950 Rousseau, a small main-
belt asteroid, is the first in 2093. AChinese SDF raid
on the asteroid found the information, although nei-
ther the experimenter nor the changeling infomorph
were found. The second happened in 2095 at Kazak-
stan’s Ministry of Mind and Body, and was overseen
by the Ministry’s lead physician, the SAI Dr. Hans.
A Kazak defector gave this information to 
Uzbekistan in 2099.
Both of these experiments were designed to test
the limits of human conditioning, either to create
minds adapted to alien environments or perfectly
loyal agents and assassins. Little is known of the
success of these projects. Consulting cyberneticists
with the University of Alberta study claim that
changeling infomorphs would likely suffer signifi-
cant mental illness. In GURPS terms, an infant-
based SAI might have disadvantages such 
as 
Callous, 
Impulsiveness, 
Low 
Empathy, 
Overconfidence, or even Solipsist.
humankind. In some versions of the meme, SAIs
hide their true nature out of deference to humans, but
guide the growth of civilization in ways that will, over
time, improve everyone’s lot. In more nefarious interpreta-
tions, the digital beings are unwilling to admit their mental
superiority to organic life because they enjoy using help-
less beings as pawns and pets.
This story, which rarely rises to the sophistication of a
conspiracy theory, has popped up sporadically since the
earliest days of artificial-intelligence research. Few people
admit to taking it seriously, even those who otherwise care
little for infomorphs. As it makes for a sinister story, how-
ever, meme variants continue to pop up.
The most-recent manifestation, which received some
attention on Swiss InVid in February 2099, claimed that
already transcendent SAIs were planning on migrating
from Earth space entirely. They are heading to a different
star system to begin their own civilization, and have plant-
ed a sophisticated web virus that will prevent any further
development of sapient machines. Experts interviewed for
the program dismissed the notion, and a spokesbeing for
the Infomorph Alliance (a European SAI-support organi-
zation) strongly rejected the notion that SAIs would sim-
ply abandon Earth and the solar system. The urban legend
was consigned to the fringes of joke tabloids – but see New
Ark, pp. 110-111.
Changeling Infomorphs
Why Did You Kill A Baby To Make Your Robot?

An urban legend of persistent popularity within
biochauvinist-leaning communities holds that there is no
such thing as a true SAI. Instead, sinister computer-
software firms abduct human infants, brainpeel them, and
make ghosts. These are then raised in computer-generated
virtual environments and made to believe that they are
purely machine intelligences. However, the ghosting
process was developed a decade after the first SAIs.
Adherents to this meme therefore naturally assume that
brain-emulation technology was held in secret by the
software developers for quite some time – or a

Compressed Viral AIs 
“Charlie, the AI . . . it’s growing in the shell!
Somehow taking over!”
“Let me see that . . . my God. Run. Run! Get the
hell out of here before it’s too late!”
– Dialogue from Mind Seed, 2096
The compressed viral AI legend appears frequently in
non-technical discussions about artificial intelligence. In
most cases, a more-knowledgeable participant easily
shoots it down. Its continued presence suggests to some
cognitive ecologists that the meme is being consciously
spread. In brief, the rumor asserts that some AIs have been
developed or have emerged which can be compressed into
executable programs occupying a small fraction of their
full size, which is otherwise normal for an AI of their
power. When so compressed it runs with proportion-
ately lower effective Complexity. (Thus an SAI-7 of this
supposed type, normally Complexity 7 and occupying 10
TB, might “compress down” to a 1 TB, Complexity 6 pro-
gram, or even 100 GB and Complexity 5.) When run on a
large enough system – which can easily happen, given the
program’s relatively small size and the possibility of dis-
guising it as something else – the AI decompresses itself
and takes over the computer.
This is one of the many legends that come out of
widespread paranoia about rogue AIs. It is given some spu-
rious verisimilitude by the addition of more detail. The
viral-AI meme is moderately popular among people with
little or outdated knowledge of computer theory, especial-
ly older individuals. It makes very little sense to anyone
who knows much about actual AIs, which are generally
highly optimized and space-efficient and have low content
redundancy, and hence cannot be compressed very much,
even for legitimate transmission. The myth’s apparent
technical detail makes it appeal to those who claim more
expertise than they actually possess. In 2096, the meme
appeared as an element in the popular InVid adventure,
Mind Seed.
Data Withdrawals
“Hey Johnny, long-time lurker, first-time partici-
pant here. I think it’s just awful what your guest is say-
ing about giving kids virtual implants. You know what
happens to people who use those! My sister-in-law’s
wife told me that a coworker of hers used one of those,
but went insane when he didn’t pay the network bill on
time and got cut off. You don’t want that to happen to
our kids, do you? And another thing–”
– From the transcript of 
Johnny Jackson At Home,
August 29, 2090
Virtual-interface-implant users and people who work
in information-dense professions count themselves lucky
if they can go for a year without being told, in solemn
tones, about the fate they would suffer if they were ever
cut off from their data networks. The data-withdrawals
meme is common in much of the Fifth Wave world, and
is hard to stamp out in part because it has some connec-
tion to reality. 
The usual telling involves the classic urban legend
“friend of a friend,” where the victim gets totally and
abruptly cut off from information networks due to bad
luck, system crashes, or being in the wrong place at the
wrong time. As a result, the victim suffers a mental break-
down. In some tellings the collapse happens instantly,
while in others the person spirals into insanity over the
course of an extended disconnection from information.
The sufferers are said to require hospitalization, therapy,
and ongoing memetic counseling, all because of an

URBAN LEGENDS AND THE PARANORMAL
AI PARANOIA
Some of the most widespread and persistent urban
legends in 2100 concern infomorphs. This is hardly sur-
prising – fear of what would happen once AIs were
invented have been a recurring element in popular fiction
for well over a century. The sheer number of such non-
human minds throughout society, whether as citizen or
servant, is one of the most significant differences
between the world in 2100 and in 2000. But despite their
relative ubiquity, many people still have questions,
doubts, and misapprehensions about AIs. 
Much of the paranoia about infomorphs – SAIs, in
particular – concerns the relative intelligence of
machines versus humans. Early predictions of what
would happen once AIs existed focused on the possibili-
ty of machines rapidly exceeding first the intelligence of
a person, then a group, then all people everywhere.
While the reality of AI technology in 2100 rules out that
possibility, the fear persists that at any time AIs could
bootstrap their own intelligence to godlike levels. That
serious infomorph technologists warn that such an event
could come to pass at some point helps to drive the con-
tinued propagation of the meme.
The most-common form of AI paranoia is simply
that of an inchoate fear, a sense of helplessness or confu-
sion that many baseline humans feel while dealing with
sapient machines. Even when the AI behaves like a “reg-
ular person,” the knowledge that its consciousness is the
result of a mass of circuits gives some people a sense of
inferiority. The pervasiveness of computing and smart
matter has further compounded these memes, as many
people wonder who exactly watches them day and night
through the countless lenses and sensors in their sur-
roundings. 

administration, the Wildlife Service withdrew the
request. This only added to the uproar.
The notion that the elevator base station has altered
weather patterns is not widely supported. The Singapore
National University study was quite preliminary, and even
the study’s lead climatologist stated that she suspected that
further research would find that the effects minimal, if they
existed at all. Nonetheless, the popular belief in Kenya –
and, increasingly, throughout the region – is that the eleva-
tor was responsible for unusually heavy, although by no
means unprecedented, winter storms in 2097 and 2099.
In late 2099 the Olympus Project public relations
office began a memetic campaign to spread the notion that
claims about weather effects from the tower were planted
by the TSA as a way of slowing or even stopping elevator
construction. The TSAis known to view the Olympus Pro-
ject negatively, and Singapore is suspected to harbor
nanosocialist sympathies. It is too soon to determine
whether this countermemetic campaign will have any
effect.
Infant Mortality
Remember, although infants born with common
genetic modifications are somewhat less likely to suffer
childhood illnesses, so-called “baseline” infants are
still far healthier than babies born in our parents’ gen-
eration due to overall improvements in health care.

inability to access any data networks for several
hours or longer.
Although very few people have actually been affected
by data-withdrawal syndrome, the effect is real. Since
2085, several dozen people worldwide have experienced a
mental collapse of this sort and the incidence rate is grad-
ually increasing. The situation leading to such an event is
fairly rare, however – merely being cut off from normal
data networks is not sufficient to bring it on. 
In every case, the victims were VII users operating
in an information-immersion environment for several
days on end, translating a wide array of information and
data sources into varied sensory input. Arbitrageurs most
often use this technique to follow complex trade
regimes, but others engaged in professions requiring
knowledge of and quick reactions to a rapidly changing,
high-intensity information environment sometimes also
use this method – a battlefield commander, for example.
If the immersive system is cut off abruptly, the user can
suffer symptoms ranging from confusion to catatonia
lasting up to several weeks. In each known case, the vic-
tim was entirely curable.
While the meme probably arose without conscious
manipulation, cognitive ecologists believe that variant
memes linking the withdrawal effects to particular brands
of virtual-interface hardware were low-grade memetic-
engineering attempts by competitors.
Elevator and Weather
“When I was young, we never saw storms such as
the ones we saw this winter. And this was during the
worst of the global-warming days! No, no, the only
change is the Olympus tower. They won’t admit it,
though. They’re too busy ruling the world.”
– Commentary on NairobiTalk memenet,
2099
The Olympus Project, the ongoing effort to build a
space elevator in Kenya, has been highly controversial
regionally. The damage done to Mt. Kenya, a sacred site to
local religions, and the apparent influence the Olympus
conglomerate has over Kenyan politics have led to a great
deal of ill will toward the project. These feelings were
exacerbated in 2098 when a leaked report draft by the Geo-
physics and Climatology Department at Singapore Nation-
al University suggested that the elevator base station,
already 10 miles tall and heading for 100, had altered
weather patterns in the area.
The study was very cautious in its claims and avoided
drawing any damning conclusions . . . But the press reports
about the article, particularly the Nairobi ones, played up
the threat to Kenyan agriculture and regional flora and
fauna. The Kenyan Wildlife Service filed an official request
with the Olympus Project coordinators for further study of
the possible weather effects. In early 2099, apparently
under pressure from the Kenyan presidential

RUMORS AND URBAN LEGENDS
Rumors and urban legends occupy very similar
niches for the professional memeticist of 2100. Both are
considered “viral ideas,” characterized more by their
ability to spread than by the depth or veracity of their
content. In addition, both are used as tools of subtle
social control, although rumors are more often used in
this way. Rumors are a favored medium for spreading
stories about improper conduct, just as urban legends
sometimes emphasize the unhappy results of such con-
duct. 
The main differences between the two are in their
complexity and persistence. Rumors are nearly always
brief, limited-idea memes, relevant to current issues but
rarely lasting longer than a few weeks or months. Urban
legends are usually more complex, telling a story rather
than describing an event or behavior and can last for
years. Neither form needs to be factual to spread, but
those with an element of truth usually propagate faster
and persist longer than completely fictional ones.

The infant-mortality myth is an interesting study
in how memes evolve. The 2100 version of the story
is straightforward. In Fourth and Fifth Wave societies,
especially the latter, any children born without at least
genefixing are significantly more likely to die in their first
three months. Most retellings of this myth assert that an
upgrade to Alpha or better is really necessary and that sim-
ple genefixing is insufficient. The blame for the non-
genefixed infants’ mortality is variously ascribed to heavi-
ly modified food, nano- or bioengineered organisms in the
atmosphere, or the prenatal and neonatal procedures used
by modern physicians. In most cases, the meme is passed
along not as an indictment of the modern envi-
ronment, but as an encouragement for the
parents to use common bioengineering
techniques to ensure their children’s
health.
What makes this myth inter-
esting is that it is the mirror of
an urban legend common ear-
lier in the century. In the
older myth, vulnerable chil-
dren were those that had
been upgraded or gene-
fixed and the healthy ones
were the “normal” infants.
As with the modern ver-
sion, the meme wasn’t
directed at environmental
issues but at the parents’
decision whether to use the
then newly available genetic
modifications. This version is
still found in societies where
widespread 
availability 
of
genetic upgrades is new.
Most memetic experts believe
that the flip-flop of the meme occurred
more or less naturally, as societies became
accustomed to the new techniques. Whether
or not the two versions are related or merely conver-
gent evolution is still a matter of debate – there is little con-
vincing evidence to point one way or another.
The Lurker Below 
“Although officials deny the existence of a ‘Lurker’
in Miami’s sewers, Mayor Friedman has agreed to
assemble a task force to look into the claims. A
spokesman for the Coral Gables Residents Association,
which organizes assistance to the poverty-ridden
neighborhood, thanked the Mayor for her help and
warned BioPharmaSouth, the firm blamed for the
‘Lurker’ release, that they would be held accountable
for any further injuries or deaths.”
– TEN-Miami Reports, July 19, 2095
The Lurker meme centers on a belief that in
many large cities accidental or intentional release of
advanced biogenetic or nanotechnological creations has
led to some kind of monstrous mutation living in their sew-
ers. In 2100, the most-common form of this meme identi-
fies the source as a batch of fully transformative proteus
nanoviruses from a secret government or corporate labora-
tory, escaped or let loose into the city’s underbelly. It has
evolved and mixed with other sewer dwelling creatures
and hapless humans that it has caught. The creature can
take any of these forms to attack its next victim. It is gen-
erally called the Lurker, although variant memes give it a
wide assortment of names.
The name “Lurker” comes from a
2052 film of the same name, a surpris-
ingly popular low-budget horror
movie made in Vancouver. The
monster in the story appeared as
a bizarre alligator-like creature
with a mass of writhing black
tentacles on its back. The
movie clearly influenced
the meme – while the vari-
ous “Lurker” sightings
over the years rarely fit
that precise description,
nearly all of them have
the multiple tentacles.
This 
meme 
has
become more common
over the last 50 years,
reflecting popular anxiety
regarding particular emerg-
ing technologies and powerful
corporations or government
agencies. The meme is most often
found in poor, disenfranchised, and
undereducated population centers,
where it spreads quickly. It often devel-
ops into a class-warfare meme, as the poor
blame rich corporations for letting such abomina-
tions roam where they live. In these instances, creatures
such as the “Lurker” are manifestations of less tangible but
more real threats such as toxic wastes or biohazards
flushed into urban sewers. Advocacy groups for the poor
or who are fighting particular corporations occasionally
use allusions to the “Lurker” or similar phenomena as a
means of galvanizing opinion.
However, the meme is also popping up in more
upscale areas in Fourth and Fifth Wave nations. The
increased sightings of supposedly mythical creatures such
as Bigfoot (see Society for Applied Teratology, p. 75) may
be contributing to the willingness of people to believe the
Lurker story. In these areas, the class-warfare aspects are
downplayed, while the “science runs amok” elements
are emphasized.
60
URBAN LEGENDS AND THE PARANORMAL

In these areas, the Lurker is often described as a
bioswarm of mutant insects or, less often, a wild
microbot swarm. A novel variant is a 2098 Paris sighting,
which described a “bioswarm of rats,” that acted as a sin-
gle, intelligent, and evil entity. The Paris Lurker was never
found, of course, but sightings continue.
Mandrakes
ALRAUNE: You don’t understand me, Father, and
you never will. You created me, but I have gone far past
even your mad expectations. [She grabs DR.
KRISTOF’s throat, impossibly fast.] You tell me that I
have no soul. [Pulls him in close, tears streaming down
her face. She whispers.] Why do I need a soul when I
have perfection? [Tosses her father across the room.]
– From the script of Mandrake, 2097
Cloning has long been accepted as a way to have chil-
dren (see p. TS72). But at the end of the 21st century, a
potential alternative reproductive technology is stirring up
public anxiety: the creation of human or other sapient
beings through neogenesis (see p. TS67). Neogenesis
works not just with genetic modifications, but with wholly
synthetic genomes, assembled codon by codon by a com-
puter. This technology is still cutting edge, and the Genet-
ic Regulatory Agency prohibits using the procedure to
create sapients. Most countries not under GRAjurisdiction
have seen public agitation for similar laws. Transhumanist
groups usually oppose restrictions on neogenesis, pointing
out that wholly synthetic viruses and bacteria are common,
and that current regulations regarding germline modifica-
tion are still appropriate for any further development of
this technology.
One of the big sources of this anxiety was the 2097
InVid Mandrake, a re-interpretation of the classic German
silent film Alraune. The latter is about a soulless half-
human woman created by artificial insemination. The
InVid’s script updated this to a child with a computer-
coded genome streamlined for “efficiency” and eventually
destroyed by the consequences of her own crimes. The
term “mandrake,” used in both the InVid and the original
film, caught on. Although the InVid wasn’t a smashing
success, it was influential enough to drive the mandrake
meme into broad public consciousness. A 2099 Trendora-
ma poll found that over half of adults questioned in the
U.S., Europe, and the PRA believed that the use of neoge-
nesis techniques to create mandrakes should be banned.
The idea of a mandrake “threat” taps into old human
anxieties: fear of the unnatural or supernatural and fear of
new reproductive technologies. Since creating mandrakes
absolutely requires the use of computers, anxieties over
computer error and corruption lend added power to the
myth. For many opponents, the process is the final step in
removing the last vestiges of natural procreation from the
human line.
URBAN LEGENDS AND THE PARANORMAL
61
MIND GRENADES
In an information-dense society, where “facts”
about a person or organization can whip across networks
at startling speed, constructed rumors and urban legends
can be deadly weapons in a memetic competition. When
properly crafted, such viral memes can be remarkably
resilient and distracting to the target. A coordinated
memetic campaign hitting an ill-prepared victim can be
ruinous. Professional memeticists sometimes refer to
constructed rumors as “mind grenades.”
The use of engineered rumors and urban legends is
often considered an art as much as a science, although
the ongoing development of the field has made 
the process more straightforward. The techniques 
commonly employed to propagate a meme or memeplex
– various media, advertising, and person-to-person 
contact – are of little use in the early days of an urban-
legend campaign. Rumors and myths, especially newly
crafted ones, are vulnerable to contradiction. If the meme
is spread overtly, the subject of the attack usually finds
out too quickly and is able to counter the myth before it
is too widespread or embedded. The goal of a rumor
campaign is to propagate the meme in ways that don’t
trigger an immediate response from the target – or evoke
a skeptical reaction from the recipient, causing him to
check the story’s veracity.
Most memetic engineers setting up a rumor or myth
campaign rely on individuals able to spread ideas based
on their trustworthiness or attractiveness. In the industry,
such a person is called a “tipper” (see p. 133). These peo-
ple specialize in subtly transmitting memes to recipients
who have come to trust them. The success or failure of a
myth- or rumor-based memetic campaign depends upon
the confidence a tipper can inspire in his contacts.
Once such a campaign is underway, the main threat
– aside from the victim tracing the meme back to its
source – is the possibility of mutation, where the meme
flips in a way that no longer focuses on the target or,
worse still, changes its focus to the source. A 2099
memetic conflict between two fast food companies is an
example of the problem. The German restaurant Happy-
BurgerLand attempted to undercut its rival, Astroburger,
by spreading a rumor that the latter didn’t use 100%
fauxflesh in its burgers. But just as the rumor was start-
ing to hit, it flipped in the PRA, and became linked to a
decade-old claim that HappyBurgerLand used wheat and
soy gluten in its product. The meme became that the Ger-
man firm was substituting gluten for fauxflesh, and to
add to the injury an activist group in New Zealand
launched a boycott of HappyBurgerLand.

Occasionally on the “Devil’s Advocate” program
the host, who goes only by “Mike,” allows his slinkers to

exchange occurred:

say?
Rashid: Hi Mike. I had a question about the “Mind
Crasher” meme.
Mike: Scary stuff, that one. Go ahead.
Rashid: Are any parts of the meme known for 
certain?
Mike: Good question. I’d say no, but one of my sources
suggests that the opening to the American Declaration of

– From “The Mind Crasher Myth:
A Study in Pathology”
in Journal of Memetic Theory,
Summer 2099 issue
Memetics is a powerful, frightening new science. It
shows how malleable and fragile the human mind is. It can
speak of an age-old belief as if it were a virus. But most
“mental viruses” behave more like persistent colds – hard
to shake, easy to spread, and usually more annoying than
dangerous. What if someone constructed a meme that
behaved more like . . . Ebola?
The “Mind Crasher” myth claims that a few years ago
some brilliant young memeticist named Gideon Michael
Thomason did just that – although no one has ever found
evidence of a memeticist with that name. He created a
meme that will force any brain infected with it into a cata-
tonic fugue, a total shutdown of all higher functions. The
meme is modular and very complex. It can be picked up
one sentence at a time. Each element can be completely
innocent, even commonplace, but when combined as a sin-
gle memeplex, the effect is devastating.
According to the legend, the Mind Crasher became a
pseudo-AI “free meme” (see p. FW32). Somehow, the
meme escaped the lab, but in doing so, was accidentally or
intentionally split into its component parts. Bits and pieces
of this meme now float around the Web, turning up as graf-
fiti, poetry, or song verses, a deadly gift to anyone who
absorbs the full set and reawa-kens the free meme.
Some versions of this myth maintain that the memeti-
cist constructed the Mind Crasher intentionally, as part of a
secret military project, but he accidentally absorbed it him-
self and it escaped to the Web through his VII. Others claim
that Thomason is still alive, but has gone underground
because he used the meme against the generals
who ordered the construction of such a horrific
weapon. Still others assert that the meme emerged
as a side effect of a wholly different project, possibly
one to render the mind invulnerable to any externally
imposed memetic construct. But every version of the
story agrees that the pieces of the Mind Crasher remain
in the wild, and nobody except Thomason himself
knows enough to hunt it down. 
Most regard this meme as a classic urban legend,
although it is more of an academic legend – many people
with typical education levels have never heard of it. How-
ever, among certain conspiracy theorists, as well as stu-
dents of philosophy and theology, this meme is almost
ubiquitous. Mainstream memeticists positively hate the
Mind Crasher meme – and have so far been unable to 
eradicate it. This is due in large measure to a handful of
memetic scientists who claim that a “Mind Crasher” meme
is conceivable, and that the story may actually be true.
Patterns in the Static
Have fun. ;-)‰
– The only explanation added 
to the Patterns document
At precisely 01:18:00 hours on November 23rd, 2093,
an anonymous poster to the CyberMysticism memenet
uploaded a file with a size of 2,800,051,338 bytes titled
“Patterns in the Static.”
The file was heavily encrypted, and as none of the
memenet regulars had a quantum computer with which it
could be decoded, few paid this file any attention . . . at
first. After some time, however, rumors began to spread
about people who managed to decrypt it, and what they
found. No member admitted to having read the unencrypt-
ed file himself, but there were numerous reports from a
“friend of a friend” who gained the key from a “mysteri-
ous source” and was able to read it. Accounts varied wild-
ly about its contents – top-secret CIA files, designs for a
machine to extract energy from the vacuum, communica-
tions with aliens, or magic spells that bind and command
infomorphs as the shamans of the past were said to com-
mand spirits. Soon, variants of the file started to turn up,
both encrypted and unencrypted. Most of these were rap-
idly identified as forgeries.
The general public became aware of the “Patterns in
the Static” file in 2099, when Peter Budenhaus’ critically
acclaimed slinky of the same name was released. Since
then, several wealthy individuals have announced plans to
buy time on a quantum computer to decrypt the file, and
they hope to announce the results soon.
Most people believe the file to be a big hoax, similar
to the Necronomicon a century earlier, and pity those who
waste time, effort, and money on it. Others, especially cer-
tain conspiracy theorists, believe that this file will provide
the answers to all their questions if only someone would
manage to decrypt it.

URBAN LEGENDS AND THE PARANORMAL

design that makes the person perfectly healthy, brilliant,
and extremely long-lived. No such genetic upgrade is
known to exist, but stories persist of biotech companies
coming up with them. In most versions of this
myth, this perfected design is either held back
by corporate leaders wishing to give the chil-
dren of the elite an advantage, or held back by
government officials fearful of a generation of
Homo superior. Even if not widely accepted,
the meme is widely recognized.
This story first popped up in the 2030s, in
the earliest days of human germline engineer-
ing. Its initial appearance was given a
boost 
by 
overly 
enthusiastic
biotechnologists who claimed
that such a genemod would be
“just around the corner.” As the
difficulties of constructing ben-
eficial genome modifications
became clear, such talk faded . .
. but the idea didn’t. The current
existence of groups such as Onos (see
p. 50) and cutting-edge parahuman designs
such as the Hera-kles model (see p. FW116)
also perpetuate the idea. Even though a “per-
fect” genemod doesn’t currently exist, most
genetic engineers admit that its eventual
appearance is inevitable.
Most memeticists believe that the meme
is a naturally occurring reaction to the pres-
ence of changing bioengineering technology.
A small minority, however, note that the prop-
agation of this meme seems to map to a slight
reduction in births, as parents hold off until the
new design is available. It is possible, these
memeticists argue, that the meme is part of a
larger campaign to slow population growth.
Late in 2099, a CyberMysticism member came for-
ward stating that the skeptics were right: “Patterns in the
Static” was a hoax, and was perpetrated by none other than
Budenhaus himself. The memenet member claimed to
have assisted Budenhaus in accessing the document
archive and went on to claim that in the spring of 2092
Budenhaus had made a bet with a friend that he would not
only create a new urban legend, but also make a slinky out
of it. With the aid of some mathematically inclined friends
of his, he succeeded – the file isn’t really encrypted at all,
but the result of a random-number generator that made it
seem encrypted. He is now the proud owner not only of
some handsome slinky revenues, but also of several bottles
of genuine 20th-century French wine. 
The CyberMysticism memenet was in an
uproar for days until a different member discovered
that the person making the initial claim had never
been a part of the network. Most memenet partic-
ipants, however, remained skeptical, noting that
while Budenhaus denied the authorship of the Pat-
terns document, he always did so in ways that would
not actually contradict the story claiming it was a hoax.
The Perfect Genemod
“My husbands have been pushing me to have a
baby with them – they’re old-fashioned, and want to
have a woman’s egg in the mix – but I keep telling them
that I don’t like any of the current genome designs.
Most are really dated – my parents are Alphas, for
goodness sake – and I keep hearing that Ithemba has a
much better design they’re planning on rolling out in
the new year . . .”

Rigged Elections
“You go ahead and vote. If you’re lucky, maybe
you’ll vote for the guy they’ve already decided will win.
Or maybe you’ll get to cast one of the handful of votes
for the other guy, the designated loser. Whichever but-
ton you push won’t really matter. Me, I’m not going to
waste time on it. If I need to waste some time, I’ll go get
another drink.”
– Jefferson Smith, in the 2042 remake 
of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington
For political reformers seeking to increase public par-
ticipation in civic duties, the most-frustrating recurring
meme is the notion that elections are somehow rigged.
Despite the assurances of official poll-watchers, a substan-
tial portion of most countries’ electorate believes that the
entire process is engineered, and the votes themselves are
meaningless. Believers occasionally link this meme to
larger political-conspiracy theories, but in most cases,
the meme usually manifests as a
combination of low turnout on elec-
tion day and general cynicism about
the process.
This meme was one of myriad
triggers for the “cyberdemocratic”
movement (see p. TS89), which
replaces numerous elected offices
with fixed-term random selections.
Many reformers find the cyberdemo-
cratic model appealing in that it
lessens not just financial corruption
of the election process but also the
ability of political parties to act in
secret. The shift to a cyberdemocrat-
ic process in venues such as the Euro-
pean and Australian parliaments
hasn’t significantly reduced the
prevalence of the “rigged election”
meme in those regions, however.
Suspicion quickly shifted to the AI
advisors and the so-called “random”
selection algorithms.
The problem for those attempt-
ing to counter this meme are the mul-
tiple historical incidents where
computerized voting systems were
altered to give an advantage to a par-
ticular party or candidate. Such
manipulation occurred frequently in
the early uses of such systems, cul-
minating in the infamous 2024 elec-
tion in the United States, in which
modified vote results in several
southern states gave less than 5% of
the tally to the President’s opponent.
To this day, a “Texas Landslide” refers to the results of a
blatantly rigged election. Despite the meme’s prevalence,
such events are now rare in Fourth and Fifth Wave coun-
tries – they remain sadly common in many developing
nations, however.
Rogue AI Virus
“Look, I’m not going to tell you how to live your
life, and as much as I’d like to, I’m not going to tell you
to get that implant removed. But for goodness sake, if
your AI tells you that you’ve received a message from
someone you don’t recognize, delete it without opening
it! You never know if it’s one of those viruses that can
make your AI turn into a rogue!”

This template is a look at the “perfect” genemod; most serious blueprints
include features very much like this. These particular characteristics come from
stolen GenTech Pacifica planning scenarios regarding its long-awaited follow-up
to the Metanoia-series upgrade. Records accompanying the template state that
the design has not yet been implemented, as it includes untested life-extension
techniques. There are occasional stories, however, that the template was imple-
mented several years ago, and a small number of test subjects have been born.
These Utopias exhibit strange behavior – rumors range from depression and sui-
cidal fantasies to hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and even telepathy – and GenTech
Pacifica does not want to announce the design until the bugs are worked out. The
company denies the very existence of the Utopia template, let alone any experi-
mental subjects. Observers note that if stories of radical life-extension technolo-
gy proved true, GenTech Pacifica would likely come to dominate the
genetic-upgrade industry.
Most credible geneticists dismiss the notion that a body can be made to age
normally to maturation and then stop aging permanently, at least given current
biological knowledge. A more plausible version replaces Unaging with Early
Maturation 3 [15], Extended Lifespan 3 [15], and Longevity [5], for a modified
template total of 225 points. While a template using these characteristics is not
now on the market, it is likely to be available within a few years. 

The Rogue Great White
“The Chinese warriors may have destroyed my
body, but I still have one last nanosocialist trick up my
sleeve! Kon, prepare the upload device. I will sacrifice
my identity, my honor, and my very humanity to fight
the Chinese forces! I shall become a murderous beast of
the seas, just as my nation has become a murderous
beast of Asia.”
– The fictional General Sowal,
TSA special operations,
in The People’s Victory:
The Story of the Pacific War,
a 2090 Chinese InVid
According to a myth popular across East Asia, during
the Pacific War a TSA special-forces soldier near death
was brainpeeled and uploaded into a great-white-shark
bioshell. When the war ended, the bioshell elected to con-
tinue fighting, harassing, and sabotaging Chinese maritime
operations. Some versions of the story hold that the shark
reverted to type, and has no purpose now other than to kill
any Chinese nationals it finds unprotected in the water. 
More informed opinion holds that the story’s origins
probably lie with the heavy losses incurred by Chinese
amphibious operations during the war. The survivors tell
fearsome stories of marines ambushed by TSA warshark
bioshells (see p. UP98), being killed and even eaten as they
left their submarine transports. As with any fish story, the
beasts have grown with each retelling, and since the war
the story has combined with ordinary shark scares, fiction-
al InVids, exaggerated fear of the TSA’s Bioweapons
Directorate, and anti-Chinese sentiment, mutating into its
present form. Any shark attack on, or disappearance of, a
Chinese citizen at sea adds further fuel to the story.
external hacking accusations, poor initial program design,
or even a tragic but random cosmic ray. Apopular assump-
tion, however, is that the main cause of rogue infomorphs
is a complex computer virus floating around the Web. In
the most-common version of this myth, most AIs have
already encountered it and are now merely waiting to be
activated by a communication from another rogue AI. 
The virus’ origin is never quite clear, and in many
cases the story hijacks elements of the “Mind Crasher”
meme (see p. 62). The rogue-AI virus is a minor element
in numerous anti-AI conspiracy theories, but also appears
in a surprisingly large number of pro-AI memeplexes. In
this latter case, those who oppose good relations between
humanity and infomorphs are said to have constructed the
virus. Among those who adopt the meme without a larger
conspiracy context, it is frequently coupled with a strong
aversion to wearable AIs.
Memetic specialists generally believe that primitive
versions of this meme predated the onset of true artificial
intelligence, appearing as fictional fears about the trans-
mission of sapience, independence, or sheer evil between
systems on a network. The prevalence of computer virus-
es simply gave the protomeme a widely recognized mech-
anism for the transfer. When the first cases of AIs going
“rogue” appeared, the meme was already in place to serve
as a plausible explanation.
Although cyberneticists publicly state that a virus
could not be responsible for rogue AIs, some admit pri-
vately that such a mechanism can’t be ruled out entirely. If
such a virus were real, however, it would have to be con-
structed by someone with intimate knowledge of AI minds
and regularly updated to reflect changes in technology.
Even if it does exist, it’s highly unlikely that the virus is
resident but inactive in any significant number of AIs.

Thought is an 
infection. In the
case of certain
thoughts, it
becomes an 
epidemic.
– Wallace Stevens
The beasts have grown
with each retelling, and
since the Pacific War the
story has combined with
ordinary shark scares, 
fictional InVids, 
exaggerated fear of the
TSA’s Bioweapons 
Directory, and anti-Chinese
sentiments.

Documents on the TSA Web provide some con-
text to the story. During the early 2070s, Dr. Eddy
Bryant was an obscure marine biologist at Cal Tech, work-
ing on bioshell adaptation of various fish species for
underwater exploration and labor. She was frustrated by
her pitiful budget compared with the enormous amounts
attracted to the highly photogenic cetacean research proj-
ects. The final straw came in 2076 when her budget was
reassigned to dolphin-uplift research and she was expected
to follow suit. Instead, she collected her research data, took
a tourist flight to Thailand and presented herself to the
Ministry of Research in Bangkok, defecting to
the TSA.
Within a few weeks, Dr. Bryant
was part of the Bioweapons Direc-
torate, heading a department and
controlling resources beyond
the dreams of a junior CalTech
researcher. By 2083, the first
top-secret warshark battal-
ions were being deployed for
the defense of TSA home
waters. At the start of the
Pacific War, Chinese marines
were very surprised by the
warshark bioshells, having
planned for a far smaller number
of nonexistent dolphin uplifts and
cybershells.
Soon, however, Chinese espionage
had tracked down the location of Dr.
Bryant’s research and development facility, and a
commando raid was launched to snatch data and artifacts,
kill all personnel, and destroy the facility. Although no data
was retrieved by the raid – the commando force was wiped
out – it did succeed in causing major damage and high
casualties among the base’s personnel. Among these was
Dr. Bryant.
Official records of the period are poor due to wartime
data destruction, but it appears that Dr. Bryant was evacu-
ated to a mainland hospital, where she later died of her
injuries. Her body was buried at sea. There are no records
of her being brainpeeled, although investigators note that
TSA cadres in Thailand high-ranked enough to qualify for
brainpeeling typically had details, including brainpeeling
attempts, expunged from their official records.
Muddying the waters is that Dr. Bryant used heavily
edited low-resolution brainscans of herself as the basis for
the warsharks’ NAI control software, a fact discovered by
Chinese scientists reverse-engineering captured warsharks
and passed on by various means to intelligence agencies
worldwide. So even if the brainpeeling aspect of the meme
turns out to be myth, the story does still have a particle of
truth: warshark bioshells with control software descended
from Dr. Bryant’s original programming remain a
major feature of TSA aquatic-defense forces. 
Vengeance of the Animals
“Now, I’m not saying that somewhere up in the
Sierra Nevadas there’s a growing pack of uplifted bears
looking at maps and conducting paramilitary training,
getting ready for the coming war against humans. But
if there were, would you really blame them?”
– Anika “Pit Bull” McCory,
speaking at an uplift-rights rally 
in Berkeley, California, 2098
This meme claims that within the last 20 years
there have been so many attempts to uplift ani-
mals, as well as to create new parahuman
species with animal genes, that enough
of these frighteningly smart creatures
have gone missing to form a small
army. Somewhere, be it in the
underbelly of a large city on
Earth, high in the mountains, or
deep in a Martian valley, there
lies a settlement of angry and
intelligent beasts with superhu-
man combat abilities. And they
wait. For freedom. For war. For
the end of humanity.
This is a very common meme
among humans with moderate edu-
cations and biochauvinist tendencies.
In Europe it also exists in a mutated ver-
sion among intellectuals with an affinity to
the Human Alliance: this version usually sees the
colony as somewhere in North America or Asia, waiting
to rid the world of their evil creators, thus serving justice
. . . and leaving the E.U. safe and secure. Beyond Earth this
meme is very rare – on Mars there are occasional rumors
about large settlements of escaped bioroids and uplifts, but
the myth is unknown elsewhere.
Like many urban myths, this meme has enough truth
that it’s hard to eliminate completely. It’s not that anyone
has found any armies of uplifts waiting for vengeance.
Instead, the infrequent discovery of small groups of feral
uplifts and animal-related bioroids, coupled with events
such as the Doolittle Virus (see p. BD140), make it easy for
people to believe that somewhere out there the intelligent
animals are massing.
Those who adopt this meme frequently have a bit of
guilt regarding human treatment of animals or have had
disturbing encounters with uplifts. Cognitive ecologists
often report outbreaks of this meme in areas where uplift-
rights activists have recently held demonstrations.
Although the major uplift-advocacy groups such as the
Sapient Animal Alliance claim no knowledge of any “ani-
mal militia,” they are careful not to deny its existence
entirely. Fear of uplifted animals seeking retribution plays
a small role in public support of uplift-welfare laws.

URBAN LEGENDS AND THE PARANORMAL

VII Shadowing
“You’re running the FiberThought implant? I
heard that it’s made in one of the Red Dunc fabs, and
makes a shadow of you without you even knowing it!
No, I don’t know what they use it for. Probably some-
thing asymp, you know those Duncs.”
– Overheard, Robinson City, 2099
A particularly virulent meme of recent origin is that a
certain brand of implant – the brand varies – is actually a
mechanism for brainscanning in order to create a secret
shadow. Red Duncanites are often thought to be behind
such a plot, although the TSA, the CIA, and, inexplicably,
the Pope have all been implicated in different versions of
the meme. More sophisticated versions, noting the impos-
sibility of constructing a functional shadow using a slow
scan over time (the only method even remotely possible
using an implant) claim that the goal is actually to create
an advanced eidolon, not a duplicate, based on detailed
knowledge of the target’s memories and personality. Cog-
nitive ecologists who have encountered this legend usual-
ly assert it’s primarily a manifestation of implant fears, and
secondarily identity fears regarding shadows, eidolons,
and ghosts.
Some memeticists disagree, noting that many meme
versions include speculations that the resulting shadows
are used to evaluate propaganda campaigns whatever
secretive groups behind the implants are about to unleash
upon an unsuspecting populace. With enough shadows or
eidolons available as test subjects, the Duncanites (or
whoever) will be able to tailor their propaganda so pre-
cisely that there will be no stopping them. In this way, the
memeticists argue, the VII-shadowing myth actually
reflects fears of memetics – that once a person’s mind is
known, they are vulnerable to anyone with a meme to
push. Many memeticists then go on to discuss just how
easy it would be to craft a meme to be irresistible if the
memetic engineer had access to shadows of his target
audience, leaving conversation partners less than
comforted.

VIRTUAL-INTERFACE PARANOIA
Although virtual-interface devices have been in use
around the world for decades, there remains a lingering
discomfort about them. With VI glasses, a small number
of people worry about augmented-reality systems alter-
ing what the users see and hear without their knowledge.
Fears surrounding VI implants, however, are more com-
mon. The notion of having implantation surgery to put a
device in your brain that can see what you see, hear what
you hear, and is host to a resident AI infomorph does not
sit well for some people. Some of the myths about VIIs
are related to common AI-related fears, while others
reflect the unique intimacy of the technology.
The most-common legend is that VIIs work 
two-way – not only are they controlled by thought, they
can in turn control thoughts. This meme shows up in a
variety of forms, from worries that the implant’s 
manufacturer is sending signals to users’ brains to more
elaborate fantasies that the government has access to the
VII, allowing it to alter a person’s thoughts or behaviors.
A common variant is that advertisers are sold access to
implants, letting them view data about responses to given
ads or altering neurochemistry in order to trigger positive
or negative reactions to given products.
The AI resident in the implants is also very disturb-
ing to many people. While attempts by infomorphs to
take over a host body are incredibly rare, they are not
entirely unknown. Most implant users prefer NAI info-
morphs to avoid even the hint of a separate intelligence
residing within their skulls.
AR is frequently employed to alter perceptions via
filters, virtual clothing, and the like, but these are uses
that the virtual-interface wearer can recognize easily. The
fear that AR is used to fool people for nefarious purpos-
es is often dismissed by manufacturers and is a frequent
joke in slapstick entertainment. Despite this, AR as a
mechanism for subterfuge is actually surprisingly com-
mon (see Really Augmented Reality, p. 138).
What makes virtual-interface-related memes diffi-
cult to counter is that nearly every feared violation has at
some point been attempted. Endeavors to alter the per-
ceptions or behavior of an implant user without his are
illegal in nearly every nation, and most VI manufactur-
ers go to great lengths to assure users that they are secure
from outside tampering. Most implant companies also
employ sizeable memetic-engineering staffs to counter
the spread of VII-related fears. In fact, the meme that
fears about implant violations are pure paranoid fantasy
– a meme that’s just as mythical as the thought that all
VIIs can be easily compromised! – is directly 
attributable to industry memeticists and is propagating
quickly.
While attempts by
infomorphs to take over a
host body are incredibly
rare, they are not
entirely unknown.

Voidskates
Day 43: The ship has again made a rapid alter-
ation off course, startling me from my sleep and caus-
ing my dear mother to spill her drink on her traveling
suit. I asked Matthew, my AI, about the cause of the dis-
ruption; it told me that the ship had performed a stan-
dard maneuver. This being a less-than-satisfactory
answer, I took my complaint to the ship’s steward. We
were informed that the captain had narrowly avoided
hitting a “voidskate,” and had in fact saved us from an
unwelcome fate. When my mother, who comes from a
more skeptical age, asked precisely what a voidskate
was, the steward showed us a poorly focused image
taken from a camera mounted on the hull. We saw,
shadowy against the dark – and far too close to the ship
for my comfort! – a vast beast, looking like a bat or
manta ray, but with a wholly artificial skin.
“Voidskate,” the steward said. “One of the aban-
doned TSA space weapons.” For some reason, Matthew
just laughed.
– From A Voyage to Titan and Back:
A Journal, 2098
Every now and then, a passenger ship traveling
toward a destination in the outer system will make a minor
shift in position, perhaps as a course correction, to avoid
intersecting the path of some debris, or to reorient a sensor.
Such motions can be jarring to its passengers, who
inevitably ask why the ship had to turn so quickly. “Void-
skate” is the usual answer. “Dangerous to hit ‘em.” The
passengers never see that voidskate, but one of the crew
usually has a photograph or holograph of another to show
what looks like an oversized manta ray “swimming”
through space, the center of its body jet black while its fins
and tail are silver and as reflective as polished chrome.
There are different stories about what these creatures
really are, usually chosen based on how gullible the crew
thinks the passengers are. They are variously described as
vacuum-adapted manta rays cooked up in a Duncanite lab;
renegade von Neumann machines, built who knows
where; or weapons designed by the crazed nanosocialist
bioweapons specialists left over from the Pacific War. In a
few cases, they are even said to be a completely alien form
of life, evolved to live in deep space.
No good spacer ever admits to not believing in void-
skates, at least not to an outsider. That said, most travel
guidebooks and guidebots refer to voidskates as a “space-
farer’s myth,” and assure the traveler that they aren’t real.
This is not to say that pranksters haven’t made voidskate
cybershells or even bioshells when the need has arisen. In
the mid-2090s, an anonymous joker started an elaborate
memetic campaign to spread a new meme – the claim that
voidskates are a myth is a government cover-up. This cam-
paign culminated in the supposed “capture” of a voidskate,
which was then taken away by government agents. A
partial slink recording of the voidskate being taken
by the government was posted to the Web, where it
became an underground hit. The memetic exercise didn’t
convince anyone that voidskates were real, but did spread
a little doubt about whether they were entirely false.
Web Gestalt
“Yes, it’s the digital overmind, but I don’t fear it. It
hasn’t hurt us yet, and even if it chooses to do so,
there’s not much we can do about it. At that point, our
only choices would be to submit or to destroy ourselves.
In the meantime, I’m just adding my voice to the mix,
trying to make sure that once the Web Gestalt starts
paying attention to us it at least understands what I’m
trying to say.”
– “Mike,” Devil’s Advocate,
February 29, 2096
One of the more unusual AI-related memes isn’t
directly about artificially intelligent beings as currently
conceived. It’s the myth of the “Web Gestalt,” an intelli-
gence emerging from Earth’s infosphere itself. According
to most versions of this meme, when the World Wide Web
of old had gained a certain level of complexity – and when
exactly this happened depends on the teller of the story – it
spontaneously gained sapience, just as emergent SAIs can
arise today. 
As the Web is connected to almost every computer
system in the solar system, the Web Gestalt integrated
itself into almost every piece of software in existence and
thus is everywhere at once. All other AIs are part of this
intelligence, usually without realizing it. Thus, the Web
Gestalt effectively rules the entire Earth, or at least the
parts of it with a web connection, and is free to follow its
own agenda. This agenda might include “improving” the
human species, wiping it out, or hiding evidence of contact
with aliens from 61 Virginis. In some versions of the
meme, the Web Gestalt is the “mind of Gaia,” and thus has
an utterly unknowable agenda, with concerns and strate-
gies measured on geologic timescales.
Belief in the Web Gestalt is one of the more-common
memes among paranoids, and given the complexity of
modern computer systems and networks, hard to disprove
without an in-depth knowledge of software technology.
Some of its believers turn to Cryptosurvivalism (see p. 31)
in the hope that this might protect their secrets from the
Web Gestalt, while others withdraw from Earth’s informa-
tion networks, either in Earth’s wastelands or in deep
space, to get away from this entity. The “mind of Gaia”
variant is common among deep ecologists and a minority
of Cybergnostics. It is gaining a small presence in the Gaia
Restoration Project (see p. 35), prompting an ongoing
debate as to whether information networks should be left
functional on Earth after humanity moves off.
Few if any computer specialists give any credence
to the notion of a Web Gestalt. Most serious network

more invalidates their faith than does the inability to
“prove” the existence of Calabi-Yau-shaped folded
dimensions in a way that a non-physicist could understand
invalidates physics.
The path that technological development has taken
over the last century has propped up aspects of the para-
normal as well. AIs and the like do not prove the existence
of the supernatural, but the language used by many devel-
opers – mind emulations as “ghosts,” for example – often
evokes traditional paranormal concepts. Some believers
are amused by the compliment, others are insulted by the
arrogance . . . And still others have come to suspect that
unbeknownst to the developers, these technologies have
somehow connected very old powers and previously
thought inaccessible forces to man’s tools.
Memetic engineers attempting to take advantage of
paranormal-phenomena belief tend not to create new
supernatural stories out of whole cloth, although in a few
cases this has been successful. More often, the memeticists
use existing paranormal stories and twist the desired
memes into local manifestations or accounts. This tech-
nique has been used to push political agendas, religious
precepts, and even simple practical jokes.
analysts hold that such a large-scale software entity
would leave telltale signals in communication chan-
nels that could be recognized and analyzed. Since such sig-
nals are absent, they claim that while individual emergent
AIs can appear without anyone realizing it, an emergent AI
that exists in the whole Web at once cannot.

BELIEFS
The persistence of belief in the paranormal is a con-
tinued surprise to casual observers of society in 2100, but
is completely in line with the expectations of professional
anthropologists, sociologists, and memeticists. The expan-
sion of science’s ability to explain the universe has not
increased its comprehensibility for most people. Even
highly educated people in 2100 take matters related to
well-established elements of quantum spookiness, multi-
ple universes, and the like largely on faith. For those who
believe in the supernatural, the inability to “prove” the
existence of spirits in a way that scientists would accept no

As science has never been able to find any evidence of
a “soul,” its existence is entirely a matter of faith. Not all
religions include belief in a soul, although most do. For
many of these, the most-vexing question of the last sever-
al decades has been whether SAIs, which clearly have
minds, also have souls. This question is of more than theo-
logical import . . . Fervent believers who do not accept the
notion of AIs with souls are more likely to treat infomorphs
as things and commit violence against them. The dominant
religions around the world have radically different per-
spectives on AIs and souls:
Buddhism: As Buddhism was the first major belief to
accept sapient artificial minds as people – in 2038, well
before SAIs even existed – followers are the most likely to
say “yes.” Not all schools of Buddhism teach the existence
of souls, but of those that do, the vast majority include
SAIs and LAIs as having them.
Chinese Traditional Religions: Although many fol-
lowers of Chinese Traditional practices accept shadows
and ghosts as carrying the souls of the deceased, they have
great reluctance to accept that constructed infomorphs
might have a spirit.
Christianity: Christian traditions vary widely. Many
mainstream Protestant and Mormon groups with an Amer-
ican background disagree with the concept of AIs having
souls, while newer interpretations, such as Christian
Hyperevolutionism, believe they do. European churches
are mixed, some welcoming SAI citizens as members
while others are the last refuges of those who deny that
SAIs should be considered people. Traditional Catholicism
has struggled with this question, but as of 2100 still teach-
es that SAIs are human constructs, not divine creations,
and thus do not have souls. Reformed Catholicism began
admitting SAIs as believers in 2080 and fully embraces the
notion of digital entities with souls.
Hinduism: Despite a richly nuanced theology, the vast
majority of Hindus are firm in their belief that SAIs are
things that act like people, not people with souls to be rein-
carnated. In India, the notion that a human can be reincar-
nated as an SAI has been linked to nanosocialists in an
attempt to discredit them. 
Islam: In the Islamic Caliphate, SAIs who accept
Islam can be citizens, and the notion that the machines
have souls is broadly accepted. There is some debate as to
whether SAIs have human souls or the souls of djinn,
supernatural spirits with bodies of fire – or energy, which
information-based entities arguably possess. Outside the
Caliphate, the concept is controversial, and is entirely
rejected in Iran and Pakistan.
DO AIS HAVE SOULS?

PARANORMAL BELIEF
DESCRIPTIONS
Memes related to the paranormal, while superficially
similar to urban legends in many ways, tend to be more
stable in content than modern myths. This is due in large
part to the nature of the content. People who accept para-
normal memes are predisposed to ignore the lack of evi-
dence or contrary evidence, and the stories are therefore
under less adaptive pressure. Memes about the paranormal
also shape some groups’ take on technology.
Alien Visitation
These days, a flying saucer could fly down Penn-
sylvania Avenue, land on the lawn of the Washington
Monument, and disgorge a ten-foot-tall robot without
anyone batting an eye. Stuff like that happens all the
time – the only difference is that they’re saucers and
robots from Earth, not some alien police force. It
wouldn’t be the day the Earth stood still, it would be the
day the Earth yawned.
– Jerzy Siencowicz,
Chariots in the Parking Lot, 2090
In a world of bizarre cybershells, augmented
reality, and regular flights into space, traditional tales
of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have long been rele-
gated to the history e-books. The occasional sighting of
glowing, rapidly moving blobs of light can be easily
explained, usually just by having an AI assistant query
local air-traffic networks. More sophisticated understand-
ing of how the brain functions has given rise to treatments
for the conditions that led to “alien abduction” delusions.
And one of the unanticipated benefits of the great decline
in real beef product consumption was the disappearance of
cattle-mutilation stories.
A handful of wilderness encounters with “alien
explorers” have been reported, invariably well away 
from human habitation. The witnesses usually don’t have
virtual-interface units or don’t manage to retrieve and 
activate them before the “aliens” escape. In two separate
cases, however, witnesses claim that aliens captured them
by catching them “in a beam that caused [them] to freeze.”
The “abductees” were then taken aboard a ship and their
virtual-interface implants were removed. Although in nei-
ther case was there any sign of recent surgery, medical
records did indicate that the witnesses did at one time have
virtual-interface implants . . . which were now missing.

URBAN LEGENDS AND THE PARANORMAL

The practice of revering an emulated mind in
the same manner as an ancestor spirit is controversial
and frowned upon by many traditional religions. Ancestor
infomorphs are almost unknown in Africa, although their
popularity is growing among followers of Voudoun (see p.
BD19). They are much more common in China, however,
where nearly a quarter of all families following Chinese
Traditional Religion now have at least one infomorph
residing as an ancestor’s spirit.
In almost every case, the spirit has a static cybershell
in the family shrine. It is almost unknown for believers to
carry the ancestor infomorph in a mobile device. This prac-
tice is not thought of as keeping the ancestor alive so much
as giving the spirit a voice for providing advice. Ancestor
infomorphs have passive read access to networks, allow-
ing them to keep watch but not send communications or
control remote devices.
Most ancestor infomorphs are shadows edited to rec-
ognize themselves as “spirits,” although some are
eidolons, usually constructed with the assistance of the
deceased person’s digital assistant. Ghosts are even less
common, in part because they are still expensive to create
and in part because the government tightly controls their
creation. The handful of ghosts created as “ancestor spir-
its” chafe at the restrictions of life stuck in a box, and either
slowly go mad, demand to be shut down, or try to play an
active and manipulative role in their descendants’ lives.
Astrology
“Say what you will, the position of the planets 
definitely affects my life.”
– Overheard, Silas Duncan Station, Ceres
Despite the utter lack of any evidence supporting its
veracity, astrology remains as popular as ever. Few people
are fervent believers in it, but a surprisingly large number
of people on and off Earth accept it as “possibly real” and
pay mild attention to their horoscopes. This sort of super-
ficial belief in astrology is actually more common in space
colonies than on Earth.
The growth of human settlements off Earth has led to
a minor boom in astrology, as the motion the of planets
through the Zodiac as seen from Earth varies greatly from
the perspective of Mars or the Trojan asteroids. People
born off of Earth have entirely different astrological read-
ings. Just how that new reading is supposed to look is the
subject of contradictory and competing approaches. There
are two leading versions. The first is Beyond Earth: A
Modern Astrology, by Miriam Vash, which uses careful
maps of planetary locations to match up off-Earth horo-
scopes with traditional charts. The second is Transhuman
Astrology, by Ralva Daoud, which dispenses with any
attempt to fit in with traditional astrological charts, and
goes on to assert that anyone who has been ghosted should
have a new horoscope drawn up based on the time and
place of the brainpeel.
Acommon belief among those who entertain the
notion of alien visitors is of alien influence in Earth’s
technological development – see, for example, Genomic
Invasion, p. 45. One interesting version of this particular
meme is that aliens have pressured humanity’s AI devel-
opers to keep machine intelligences limited to roughly
human levels. Apparently, superintelligent AI singularities
often lead to species extinction and can wreak havoc on the
galaxy until stopped. This is why, they claim, there is no
real evidence of alien civilizations – the vast majority were
wiped out during a period of AI transcendence.
Classic UFO sightings remain a staple of spacer tales
(see Whalers, p. 78). Although certain regions of space,
such as Earth’s orbit, seem crowded there are actually rel-
atively few ships in the Solar System compared to vehi-
cles in Earth’s atmosphere. What’s more, space ships
follow well-understood physical limitations to their
velocities and trajectories. An unidentified vehicle, par-
ticularly one seemingly not abiding by the laws of
physics, is very hard to not notice. Many spacers, espe-
cially those in the Deep Beyond, speak of sightings ships
that don’t look or act like anything they’ve ever seen.
Most laugh it off as a trick of the eye or a secret govern-
ment experimental ship – this laughter invariably comes
across as nervous than humorous.
Ironically, even as alien-visitation memes continue to
thrive among the general populace, most experts have
come to the conclusion that humankind is almost certainly
the only intelligent life in the Milky Way. Even with 2100’s
advanced signal processing and telescopes able to resolve
planets in other systems, no signs of alien intelligence have
been found. Fermi’s Paradox still stands –  even a cautious
civilization could colonize the entire galaxy in a cosmo-
logically brief amount of time, but we find no evidence of
any other civilizations out there.
Ancestor Worship
Wen Shan passed away on Tuesday night. He is
survived by his wife, four children, 14 grandchildren,
and eight great-grandchildren. His body was interred
in the family crypt. His spirit joined the family shrine,
and welcomes visitors daily.
– Announcement on a Hong Kong 
civic record website
Ancestor worship is a long-standing element of many
traditional religions. In most, the ancestor spirits rarely
intervene in day-to-day life, but are always watching.
Behavior that offends the ancestors is to be avoided, at the
very least because it brings shame upon them. The advent
of mind-emulation technology has given a new form to
traditions of ancestor worship. The ability to create
eidolons, shadows, and ghosts as infomorphs lets 
ancestors remain a presence in a family’s life as more than
distant spirits.

Bioshell Zombies
“Antoine, this is Mr. Constantine. Please take Mr.
Constantine’s coat and see that he is comfortable.”
“Gnnnnnnnnh.”
“Do it! Or today you shall feel the lash!”
– From the 2097 InVid Voodoo Children,
which billed itself as a 
“speculative documentary”
Decades of horror movies and InVid notwithstanding,
traditional zombies have little to do with rotting flesh and
a hunger for brains. In Voudoun, zombies are thought to be
soulless, not rotting, and their bodies still function as do
those of living beings. Many anthropologists believe that
traditional zombies were created by poisoning a victim
with blowfish venom in an amount insufficient to
kill, but enough to completely paralyze him and make his
heartbeat nearly undetectable. As the victim would still be
awake, but utterly unable to move or make a sound, he
would see his family mourning and himself put in a coffin
and buried. As those suffering this fate were usually
believers in Voudoun themselves, when the houngan, or
priest, dug them up a day or so later they willingly accept-
ed their new roles as zombies.
As such poisoning and slavery is now far harder to get
away with, there is a trend in areas where Voudoun is
prevalent for houngans to have corpses converted into
necromorph bioshells (p. TS126). The bodies usually
come from living individuals who sell their bodies to the
priests in exchange for money or various services.
Depending upon the contract, the body only becomes
available after the person eventually dies or the

Born 2055. Age 45; 6’1”, 175 lbs. Plain-looking Italian
in good physical condition, a tendency to forget to shave.
Has an intense “fire in his eyes” when he speaks.
Paulo Carrival is on his way back to Earth after spend-
ing the last decade in various residences. His last home
was in Port Lowell on Mars, but he has spent time on the
Moon, on Ceres, and in a variety of PSVs traveling the sys-
tem. He is an astrologer, and a well-regarded one. He
worked with Ralva Daoud to develop the “Transhuman
Astrology” approach, and is a strong believer in the inher-
ent truthfulness of the practice.
If asked why he is heading back to Earth, Carrival
speaks excitedly, sometimes slipping into his native Italian,
about the prospects for bringing the techniques of inter-
planetary astrology to those still stuck on Earth. It is quick-
ly clear to listeners that while he is a firm believer in
astrology he is also pragmatic about how most people view
it. He argues that, even if there is little superficial evidence
for it, astrology serves as a structure upon which people
can build a sense of the future. Most people live in fear of
what the future might bring, he says, and astrology calms
them, gives them belief that they can see a path for their
lives amidst the uncertainty.
Carrival is less likely to speak of his other reason for
leaving Mars. In late 2099, he was asked to provide a chart
for an aging Chinese man, not knowing that the man was
actually a Triad elder. The horoscope was painfully inac-
curate and the man was killed shortly thereafter. (Carrival,
if pressed on this issue, claims he was given incomplete
information about the man.) Soon afterward Carrival heard
rumors that the Triad member who had commissioned the
chart as a gift was embarrassed at the outcome, and sought
to have Carrival killed. The astrologer decided that it might
be time to move on . . . And given that the Triads have a
significant presence in the Belt, Carrival chose to head
back to Earth.
Carrival is a naturally friendly individual, uncomfort-
able with remaining in the background. If encountered in
transit, he is likely to strike up a conversation, although he
is hesitant around any Chinese. He is not certain that he is
marked for death, but he isn’t about to take any chances.

good thing. The soul, by virtue of being held in
cybernetic form, is now potentially stuck on Earth for-
ever, and is unable to move on to whatever follows death.
In their view, as the universe was created with the passage
of spirit from Earth to the Hereafter as an intrinsic element,
this soul capture is an affront to the universe. Serious con-
sequences will ensue if humankind does not abandon this
practice.
The most vocal advocates of this position are a group
of Sufis based in London, led by Sarriya al-Mazif. Mem-
bers regularly attend interfaith conferences in order to pro-
mote their views, and al-Mazif recently began studying
advanced memetic techniques to support their campaign.
The group believes that without a physical body – and they
do not count cybershells, even bioshells, as being true
physical bodies – a soul cannot grow. Aghost’s soul is stat-
ic and unchanging, and therefore slows the overall evolu-
tion of the universe. If a soul is not allowed to grow in the
physical world, it must be released to the world beyond.
This notion is slowly spreading and has started to
appear in a variety of religious settings. It is a common
point of discussion in religious schools in the Islamic
Caliphate, and a number of American traditional Christian
churches have begun examining the issue. The November
2099 murder of a ghost in Atlanta, Georgia, has been
blamed on a man found with ghost-soul controversy mate-
rial in his possession. Officials are unsure of whether he
was acting alone or with a group of others with similar
beliefs.
zombie-to-be may be required to commit suicide.
The latter form is technically illegal in most places
Voudoun is practiced, but in many cases, the authorities
look the other way. Contracts not requiring suicide may be
gruesome, but they are legally binding; there is a small
industry of “contract fulfillment specialists” willing to
travel to retrieve corpses now owned by the houngan.
Often, the future zombie is implanted with a small web-
connected biosensor, sending out a signal when the subject
is close to death or dead.
Most necromorph bioshell zombies run a specialized
NAI designed for appropriately servile behavior. Very few
houngans have access to the equipment and resources to
perform shadowing or ghosting of a prezombie, but the
practice is not entirely unknown. In these cases the info-
morph mind is edited into compliance, although the pro-
grammer is careful not to remove the infomorph’s
memories. Using an edited ghost as the mind of a bioshell
zombie is generally illegal; using a shadow, while 
ethically dubious, is generally legal.
Given the expense of producing a
bioshell zombie, including the fees paid to the
body’s owner, the practice is not common.
Zombies are most often constructed to act as
servants for the houngan. Secular leaders in
communities where Voudoun is practiced may
also be able to convince a houngan to con-
struct a zombie, although the price is usually
steep.
Ghost Souls
“Scientists have done what mystics
have feared for centuries: they’ve captured
the soul, put it in a bottle, and stuck it on a
shelf. They may not realize it, but what
they’ve accomplished upsets the balance of
the universe. When a person dies, his soul is
supposed to move on. If it doesn’t, if it’s
held in the material world, the universe will
not be forgiving.”
– Sarriya al-Mazif, speaking at
Second World Transcendence
Forum, 2095
For most people who believe in the exis-
tence of souls, the controversy about ghosting
largely focuses on whether the ghost retains this vital
essence. If it does not, then the ghost is little more than an
elaborate toy – no matter how much it may think of itself
as the continuation of an individual. If it does have a soul,
however, then to most believers the ghost should be treat-
ed as a true person, as it has the same soul in digital form
as was possessed in the original body.
Not everyone is so complacent, however. A small but
growing number of people strongly believe that ghosts
have the souls of the original person and this is not a

Kabbalistic Space Tourism 
“You follow the paths, the 32, and along each
find the questions for the answers you have long known.
You explore the worlds, the four, and on each find the
birth to match the death you have long embraced. You
accept the spheres, the 10, and with each you reveal the
layers of the self.”
– From Our Planets, Our Selves, 2087
This meme, most often found in the United States and
Europe, holds that the planets and satellites of the solar
system are the spheres of the Kabbalah’s tree of life, and
that interplanetary travel is spiritually useful for personal
growth and path working. Although followers of the Kab-
balah are among those who have noticed the odd symbol-
ism and mysterious behavior of World Tree Enterprises
(see p. 52), there’s actually very little overlap between
those who see WTE as having mystical resources and
those who believe in a connection between the Kabbalah
and the solar system’s structure.
This meme is common among those who follow New
Age-style beliefs and is largely divorced from its roots in
mystical Judaism. Many recent self-help guides have
stressed the idea of personal growth through space pil-
grimages, and most use a somewhat spiritual interpretation
of the process. The Kabbalistic version has been present
for decades, but really took off in 2087 with the publica-
tion of Our Planets, Our Selves. This book mixed ideas
from the Kabbalah into an otherwise straightforward pop-
memetics treatise. While a substantial minority of those
who have adopted this meme embrace its mystical ele-
ments, even many people who totally reject the occult
enjoy the idea. Recently, the meme has inspired chamber
music, concert music, and an opera.
Many memeticists suspect that the fairly casual con-
nection to the more spiritual aspects of the Kabbalah is part
of why the meme has remained reasonably popular. People
who enjoy the symbolism and ritual, but don’t take the
mystical aspects seriously, have adopted the meme without
questioning their other beliefs. At the same time, hardcore
Kabbalists who truly believe interplanetary travel will alter
their lives and help them achieve spiritual growth have had
life-altering experiences.
Given the time required for interplanetary travel, no
single person has actually completed the “32 paths” by
2100, and very few have managed to visit every planet.
Martians
“Take me to your leader – your price leader for
new cars!”
– The Ancient Martian, used in a variety 
of ads in America/Mars
Despite Mars being increasingly domesticated and a
serious lack of evidence, some people still think it
was once home to an advanced civilization. The per-
petuation of this meme comes from two major
sources. The first is prospectors and other Martian frontier
inhabitants, passing along tales of complexes built into the
sides of canyons and other places . . . which always seem
to collapse and disappear before the next trip out. The sec-
ond is from dedicated believers in government conspira-
cies, who claim to have evidence that Martian structures
such as the pyramids and the “face” were intentionally
damaged or destroyed by the first wave of government
explorers, seeking to cover up proof of Martian life. That
the first explorers were from China, while the conspiracy
seems to focus in the United States, matters little to
believers. The conspiracy needs to be international to be
so powerful!
Most people who believe in ancient Martians are fair-
ly wishful in their approach, with more of an “it sure would
be great if . . .” rather than an “it must be true!” perspec-
tive. This outlook on Martian life has broad sympathies,
and many Mars-related organizations have adopted bits
and pieces of life-on-Mars lore as symbols of their groups
– from cartoon Martians to tongue-in-cheek references to
War of the Worlds. While few actually believe that any evi-
dence of an ancient Martian civilization will ever be found,
the idea is common in popular media on and about the
planet.
The belief in advanced Martian life is a more-serious
meme for a very small but active collection of people. The
“Mars Truth Committee,” funded by the eccentric Bolly-
wood billionaire Indira Patel, seeks to prove that Mars
once held advanced life, and that the American and Chi-
nese governments are working together to suppress this
information. The organization has already made two expe-
ditions, in 2089 and 2095, and is gearing up for a third.
Neither of the previous two – one to the “face,” the other
to the “pyramids” – uncovered anything of note. The
newest trip, scheduled to leave for Mars in June 2100, is
the best equipped yet. They intend to spend a full Martian
year visiting sites purportedly uncovered by Martian fron-
tier explorers. As of the beginning of the year, the Com-
mittee is making final purchases and lining up the last few
crewmembers. They are looking for a small, independent
slink- and InVid-production crew to go with them to record
their discoveries.
Among the sites the Mars Truth Committee plans to
visit is an area near Elysium that has produced somewhat
unusual density readings in recent surveys. A study using
vibration patterns to map the types of rock under the sur-
face had results that suggest a series of chambers. This
area is actually the location chosen by Mohammed ibn-
Khalid for his “Native Martian” hoax (see p. ITW120)!
The site is near the bottom of their list, but if the Mars
Truth Committee makes it to the site, they may be in for
quite a surprise . . .

One of the most persistent paranormal memes is belief
in psychic abilities. For most people who host the meme,
the belief manifests as a general sense that they must be
real because so many people know about them. For a hand-
ful, the belief is more developed and structured. 
The Mentalist Fraternity is a group of
men, largely in Eastern Europe and Russia,
who firmly believe that the human mind
has untapped psychic powers. They
point to millennia of reports and sto-
ries about mystical powers and
dubious research into extrasensory
perception. These abilities, they

next step in human evolution.
Mentalists don’t necessarily
believe every person who claims
to be psychic, but do believe that
people with real powers exist and
that many people have psychic
potential. They also believe that
the powers are more often found in
men than in women.
The Fraternity’s external face is
that of an eccentric group of self-
described psychics who wish to help any-
one who feels they might possess some kind
of paranormal abilities. The leader of the Frater-
nity, Vladimir Koleshenko, is the only child of a fairly
wealthy Russian family, and spends his inheritance on the
organization, flying their investigators around the world to
interview and test potential psychics. While they have
made no breakthroughs that stand up to scrutiny, they have
a devoted following of nonpsychics – the “opaque,” in the
terminology of the Fraternity – who devoutly wish to find
the key to unlocking humanity’s “full potential.”
Behind this superficial mysticism, however, is an
elaborate conspiracy theory to explain why psychic abili-
ties are so hard to find. Central to it is the belief that
advanced genetics have uncovered the traits that govern
these abilities. The Fraternity is convinced that genetic-
engineering corporations have actively hidden the results
of all such research. The corporations know what gene
sequences activate psychic powers, but they keep the
information from the public, only giving access to secret
government and corporate intelligence forces. They

For the biotechnologists who create these
beasts, the pleasure of knowing you have created
something that hasn’t been seen on Earth for millions of
years, if ever, is tempered by the knowledge that these cre-
ations are most likely going to be hunted down, or at best
left to wander within the walls of their environment once
their owner gets tired of them.
In 2091 a small group of specialized genetic design-
ers from leading biotech companies decided to do some-
thing with their skills that would be a bit more
interesting than updating velociraptor skin genes to
match corporate colors. Calling themselves the Society
for Applied Teratology, they put together a private
research and development facility in order to create their
own monsters. Their public work focuses on creating
beasts for the entertainment industry and a handful of
private collectors who are more interested in ecosystems
than hunting. They charge top dollar but are widely 
considered the best.
Their secret work gives them the most pleasure,
however. These teratologists decided to make the myth-
ical real, and for much of the last decade have bred crea-
tures from the world of cryptozoology – such as the
Sasquatch, the Loch Ness Monster, and the Chupacabra
– and released them into the wild. They are careful to
make their creations suit the habitats, and free them
in areas well away from human inhabitants. Their
goal isn’t to make the monsters a common sight,
but to give reality a bit more mystery. Each of the
monsters is designed to be shy and fearful of people.
As a result of their efforts, Chupacabra activity in
the wilds of northern Mexico is reported a couple of
times a year and a new pair of Chupacabra smuggled
into Brazil were recently sighted by locals. To their dis-
may, Nessie isn’t doing well –
they misjudged the environment
of Loch Ness, which isn’t warm
enough for a reptile and doesn’t
support enough fish for a mam-
mal or dinosaur. They have a
Yeti design, but don’t yet have a
plan to get it to Nepal. They
have a workable genome for a
“Lurker” like the classic movie
version, tentacles and all, but
haven’t yet decided on an
appropriate place to release it
(see p. 60).
By far their greatest suc-
cess 
has 
been 
with 
the
Sasquatch, or “Bigfoot.” They
introduced five families of
Sasquatch up and down the
Sierra-Nevada Mountains, right
along the California/Nevada
border. The Sasquatch are
doing spectacularly well, and
up until August 2099, the Soci-
ety was working out a neogene-
sis design for Bigfoot couples
actually able to breed. 
In August, however, they
heard about the mysterious mur-
ders of hikers near where the most recent batch were
released. Locals blamed bears, although bears hadn’t
been spotted in that area for much of the century. Soci-
ety designers are worried that the Sasquatch may be to
blame – the last batch, released in late 2098, had been
tweaked to give its omnivorous diet more of an empha-
sis on meat. In December 2099, the teratologists poring
over the genome discovered that the fear-of-people mod-
ifications had been overwritten by parts of the diet
change. While that doesn’t prove that the Sasquatch
were responsible for the hikers’ death, it’s a possibility
that must be considered . . .

2096 by the Society for Applied Teratology. Sasquatch stand nine feet tall, and are
covered in dark, thick fur, which is mottled brown with some green, giving them
minor camouflage. Their hands have fairly sharp claws but are otherwise human-
like, which allow them to strip bark from trees and dig for roots and small prey. They
are not social creatures, although they sometimes travel in “family” groups. They are
normally terribly shy, and do whatever they can to avoid humans and machines. The
2098 Sasquatch release, however, is not quite as bashful and is less likely to run if
discovered by humans.

his then home in Toronto.
Other than Otomo’s apparent success at predicting the

dence for T.A.’s ability to give insight into the future.
Nonetheless, the design aesthetic and personal advice
derived from the practice have enduring popularity. Even
if the mystical elements are glossed over, a skilled T.A.
consultant is still able to make a living.
Vampire Virus
That is not dead which can eternal lie,
And with strange aeons even death may die.
– H. P. Lovecraft
The advent of functional nanotechnology unleashed
numerous short-lived urban myths. Fears of gray goo
and hopes for a diamond age flared and then sputtered
out as reality set in. A handful of myths remained, how-
ever, including fears that specially designed nanotech-
nology could be used to alter a human’s body. A
common manifestation of this urban legend was that
nanotech developers had come up with a virus that could
turn people into “real vampires.” Nobody feared these
creatures – the myth reflected a larger fear of 
scientific irresponsibility.
Transcendental Astromancy is a highly popular
divination technique as well as the title of a 2041 book
by the Franco-Japanese novelist and poet René Otomo
(1988-2095), who invented the practice. Transcendental
Astromancy, also called “trance” or “T.A.,” is a complex
mix of Feng Shui, Chinese and western astrology, and var-
ious symbols and rituals from classical western alchemy.
Otomo and his technique became famous after his predic-
tion about the “doom that will visit Luna City” came true
with the Shackleton disaster in 2085. Today there are T.A.
health, architecture, interior design, and career consultants
– or equivalent expert programs and SAIs – found in any
major city or settlement from Earth to Europa. 
While the number of “true believers” in Transcenden-
tal Astromancy declines rapidly with increasing education,
this meme has gained a firm foothold in all levels of soci-
ety throughout the solar system. Trance is especially pop-
ular on Mars, where Otomo took up residence in 2091.
Surprising, though, is the high percentage of Hyperevolu-
tionists receptive to this meme. 
Otomo is sympathetic to Infosocialism, and made a
point of only defending his intellectual-property rights
regarding T.A. when others sought sole ownership of the
idea. Otherwise, Otomo encouraged individual consultants
to develop their T.A. practices in order to spread the con-
cept around. After the publication of Propagation of
Human Ideas, Otomo enthusiastically adapted memetic

The “Vampire Virus” would have remained a
minor urban legend were it not for the efforts of a
Bulgarian nanoscientist named Georgi Stanishev. In
2098, inspired by the proteus-based nanoviruses such as
Doolittle and Monkeybite (see p. BD140), Stanishev
designed a complex proteus virus that effectively gives a
human vampire characteristics. Victims of the nanovirus
found their canine teeth more than doubling in length,
their skin blistering even from brief exposure to sun-
light, and, most troubling, a desire to drink blood. Stan-
ishev introduced the virus at dance clubs and parties
across central Europe frequented by young people with
a fetish for vampires and gothic horror. He figured cor-
rectly that at least some of them would appreciate the
gesture.
By the time Stanishev was arrested and charged
with the development and use of a nanotechnological
weapon, nearly a thousand people in Bulgaria, Hungary,
and Germany had been infected. The virus was easily
countered, and the vast majority gratefully accepted
treatment. Several dozen did not, however, and chose to
remain “vampires.” European authorities decided that as
long as these “vampires” were not breaking the law, such
as by attacking people and drinking their blood, there
was little that they could do to stop them.
In late 2099, reports surfaced that new “vampires”
had been spotted in Amsterdam and London. Fearing a
copycat outbreak, European police, backed up by the
GRA, brought in several of the new “vampires” for
questioning. They soon determined that these new cases
came from uninfected people drinking the blood of viral-
ly loaded “vampires.” Stanishev, questioned in prison,
denied designing the virus to allow this, but agreed that
it certainly was possible.
As of January 2100, European authorities are about
to track down, arrest, and forcibly cure the remaining
viral vampires before their numbers grow.

Whalers 
Whalers are not mad. Well, some of them may be
mad, but there is something out there: secret “black”
SDVs, experimental bioships, or, yes, maybe even giant
space whales. I know too many good men and women,
people whom I would trust with my life, who say they’ve
seen something they can’t explain.
– Captain Jason Wilson, USAF (retired),
in his introduction to the 2095 reprint 
of Gary White’s book 
The Shape Beyond the Black
The so-called “Whalers” – also known as “whalers of
the deep beyond,” or “beyonders” – are members of the
Argus Club, a loosely organized group of spacefarers who
claim to have encountered some kind of gigantic life form
in space. They discuss strange sensor readings that indi-
cated the presence of an unidentifiable object, at least the
size of a large space-dominance vehicle (SDV). Even more
report a visual contact they had while working outside of a
ship or station – contact with some slow-moving gargan-
tuan thing, often of a dark blue-gray color. Those encoun-
ters usually took place far beyond the Main Belt and seem
to be more common toward the Kuiper Belt. 
While there have always been stories about
“something out there,” the last 30 years have
seen a sharp increase of “whale sightings” from
the small but growing number of spacers who
make their living beyond the orbit of Mars. It is
unknown who exactly was the first person to
report such an encounter, but Gary “Ahab” White
(2048-?), a Mars-born writer of Australian heritage and
member of the Farhauler’s Guild, was certainly the one
who first went public with it. He wrote his first article on
the “whales” in 2074 and founded the Argus Club in 2081.
He also wrote two books on the creatures he called Rocs –
The Shape Beyond the Black, 2079, and Dreaming Gods,
2089. White disappeared without a trace somewhere in the
Main Belt in 2095. At present, the beyonders lack any real
spokesman and are the butt of jokes all over the solar sys-
tem, but there are those who see the disappearance of Gary
White as proof of a major cover-up. 
It is almost impossible to find any supporter of this
meme on Earth – in fact, it is difficult to find many peo-
ple who have heard of this meme on Earth. Earthers who
have traveled to the outer system sometimes confuse
tales of “space whales” with “voidskates” (see p. 68).
Among those who work in inner-system space, whalers
are raving lunatics who have spent too much time in
space and Martian bars. Only hardcore conspiracy theo-
rists and those who believe alien life is here give their
stories credit. This changes slowly the closer you get to
the Main Belt. Belters, survivalists, and Duncanites are
all likely to know a whaler personally . . . and sometimes
even believe him.

CULTURE

The mix of overwhelming global
media and memes and assertive local
or even individual preferences is the
fundamental characteristic of culture
in 2100. There are few places utterly
disconnected 
from 
the 
world-
spanning information networks.
Along with functional real-time
translation, it is possible for people
thousands of miles apart to have
ongoing professional and personal
relationships. That one person may
be a Christian Hyperevolutionist and
the other a Hindu Preservationist is
less relevant when both can talk
freely and comfortably about the lat-
est episode of Ein Berliner or the
bizarre fashions emerging from the
Duncanite Design Center on Ceres.
For many people of 2100, tolerance
of individual choices has come to
mean that those differences are less
important than the shared culture in
which nearly everyone lives. This
does not mean that such differences
have disappeared or that they don’t
play into people’s lives, however.
Culture and Memes
For academic memeticists, “cul-
ture” is the set of rules a society uses to
generate and decide between memes.
Culture includes a society’s norms and
values, along with its styles of art, its
accepted beliefs, and the full range of
its cognitive artifacts – journalism,
entertainment, etc. Memeticists need
to understand a group’s culture before
they can craft memes that will survive
or thrive in that society.
Many memeticists pay close
attention to popular culture. Pop cul-
ture, once derided as ephemeral and
superficial, is now considered the most
Darwinian environment for memes.
Some survive by evolving persistence
and complexity; others survive by vir-
ulence and novelty. These latter often
form waves of fast-growing, fast-
spreading memes.
Memetic scholars consider sub-
cultures, conversely, as pockets of
memetic stasis. While particular
memes within a subculture may shift
over time, they are often divorced
from the larger changes of culture
80
ALTERNATIVE CULTURE
COGNITIVE EXTREMOPHILES
In 2093, Beatrice Samuels, a memetic scientist at the University of Leeds,
wrote a paper for the Journal of Memetic Theory about a widely noticed phe-
nomenon. A small portion of the human population is attracted to memes that
sit well outside the mainstream culture. In Propagation of Human Ideas,
LOGOS had identified them as “memetic outliers,” and theorized that they
were the results of rare, self-reinforcing combinations of memes and meme-
plexes that pushed the holders to the edges of cultural acceptability. Samuels
disagreed, and produced compelling evidence that at least some tendency to
seek the fringes was the result of neurological structures. She called those with
this characteristic “cognitive extremophiles,” in reference to lifeforms that live
in conditions far outside of Earth’s physical norms.
In the years since Samuels’ article, subsequent research has given new
insight into the nature of cognitive extremophiles. This includes some tenta-
tive techniques for combined memetic and neuromedical treatments to damp-
en the desire to accept and propagate strange and often dangerous memes.
Some memeticists oppose the widespread use of such techniques, however,
arguing that cognitive extremophiles have an important place in the overall
memetic environment. Some memes that appear bizarre or overly risky are
actually appropriate when considering the ongoing technological and social
changes. Cognitive extremophiles can embrace and retain memes that appear
irrelevant or worse at present, but may prove useful in the future. Furthermore,
since memes often evolve in response to the existence of other memes in the
environment, cognitive extremophiles provide a source for memes that push
the evolution of others.
An individual identified as or claiming to be a cognitive extremophile has
a +1 reaction modifier with memeticists who believe them to be valuable, and
a -1 reaction modifier with memeticists who believe them to be dangerous.
About half of the professional memeticist community harbors feelings one
way or another.
It is possible to bioengineer a brain to contain the neurological structure
associated with cognitive extremophiles. The degree to which the effect man-
ifests depends on how the person is socialized. At minimum, the result is Weak
Will (Vs. memetic influence only, -75%) [-1/level]; at worst, the result is
Gullibility [-10].

known as the Diplomacy Node, containing detailed
information about all known cultural groups and
where members can contact volunteer SAIs well trained in
social interaction. A single SAI can handle many interac-
tions at once as long as a connection is possible. Conver-
sation with an Aesthetic Modernist is markedly sanitized,
but always polite and socially acceptable.
In its minimal form, Aesthetic Modernism is simply a
deep immersion in the customs and norms of a given group
prior to interaction, along with focused monitoring of the
Modernist’s statements and gestures. Most Modernists get
really good at listening to advice from their AIs about what
to say next, even while speaking. 
More extreme Modernists actually refuse to speak
directly to others, instead using their cultural AIs as filters.
During a given interaction, the human subvocalizes a pro-
posed response to the AI, who either speaks the proper,
inoffensive remark out loud, or tells the wearer exactly
what to say and do. The AI also actively monitors the
wearer and all others in view, warning when an action or
word is inappropriate to someone nearby. Experienced
Modernist-AI pairs are skilled at anticipating offense and
can lead their conversation partner away from a possible
insult before it even takes place.
Aesthetic Modernists are heavily dependent upon
information technology. Most outright refuse to go places
where they may lose contact with cultural databases. Very
few Modernists use wearable interfaces, fearing the loss of
their advisor infomorph. These AIs are always either LAIs
or SAIs, as NAIs are not considered reliable enough when
it comes to dealing with human feelings and pride. 
This philosophy is moderately popular in Fourth and
Fifth Wave societies, especially where several cultures live
in proximity. The largest body of Aesthetic Modernists is
in Europe. Many diplomats, international traders, and paci-
fists have adopted elements of this philosophy. Critics par-
ody Aesthetic Modernism by claiming that it boils down to
“if you can’t say anything nice, say nothing at all.” Others
consider those who have accepted this memeplex to be
spineless thralls of diplomatic AIs, lacking real opinions
and or even free will.
People adopting this philosophy and who have the
proper equipment have Cultural Adaptability (p. CI23) and
a +2 bonus to Savoir-Faire for all publicly described cul-
tures and subcultures with more than 1,000 members. Aes-
thetic Modernists who rely on their AIs for advice but
speak for themselves have a slight delay in conversation is

are occasionally annoying. This is effectively the Uncon-
genial Quirk [-1]. For those who have their AIs speak for
them, reactions are much more negative, equivalent to an

ing face-to-face conversations with non-Aesthetic Mod-
ernists. The Aesthetic Modernism software costs $10,000;

going on around them. Many people who embrace a
subculture do so precisely because it is disconnected
or opposed to the culture at large. Subcultures, in many
respects, are a form of Isolate community existing in the
heart of global societies. 
Memetic Variation
Not every meme exists solely to propagate. Some
memes and memeplexes thrive on being different
approaches to life. These can manifest as subcultures,
pop-culture artifacts, and movements. They are wide-
spread in 2100; some are serious explorations of different
ways of life, while others are common forms of self-
expression. In each case, the meme contains an element
that limits its growth. If most of these memes were wide-
ly adopted, they would fission into competing versions,
mutate into something more palatable to the global cul-
ture, or quickly die out.

DESCRIPTIONS
These memes and memeplexes vary in complexity
and depth, but all are philosophies and lifestyle choices
embraced only by smaller groups.
Aesthetic Modernism 
What is the alternative? Continued war? The ulti-
mate domination of a single cultural paradigm and the
obliteration of differing norms and values? As long as
people have divergent beliefs there will be the potential
for conflict. We simple feel that the inherent value of
cultural variety is greater than the value of being
“right.”
– Willem Bronowski,
Aesthetic Modernist Manifesto, 2085
This philosophy holds that since only a sadist inten-
tionally hurts another’s feelings, all human conflict stems
from an inability to understand each other fully. When peo-
ple say hurtful things, it is either because they are ignorant
of the other’s culture or they hold other cultures in con-
tempt due to misunderstanding. This inevitably leads to
discord, which in turn leads to hatred and war. Thus, if
people were able to understand each other’s culture and
avoid offering unintentional insult, there would be far
fewer conflicts, and very likely no real cause for war. 
Networked artificial intelligence is the key to making
this possible. A human simply cannot know enough about
every culture or subculture to follow the tenets of Aesthe-
tic Modernism in every possible interaction. Accordingly,
followers of this memeplex rely on their AI advisors, who
can keep track of myriad cultures with access to immense
networked databases, to help them avoid offense. The

Artifactists
A nearby gamma-ray burst scours this section of
the galaxy clean of all life, organic and digital. An acci-
dental nanoclasm destroys everything. Humans, tran-
shumans, and AIs decide that they’ve had enough of
each other and start one final war. God gets bored and
presses the delete key.
Can you really say that none of these are possible?
And if such dire occurrences were to take place, can
you really say that you wouldn’t care if there was no
record left of who we were?
– Ivan Kothburn, Fossils of Us, 2060
The Artifactists are an artistic movement that
springs from many of the same concerns that motivate
the Survivalist meme (p. TS92) and drive the Civilization
Archive Project (p. BD10) and Deep Time Foundation (p.
DB50). These artists believe that, for one reason or anoth-
er, humanity and transhumanity are very likely doomed to
suffer a catastrophic event, possibly leading to
humankind’s extinction. Most Artifactists, unlike Survival-
ists, believe that this doom is still a considerable ways off.
(The Artifactist manifesto Fossils of Us cites a Civilization
Archive study claiming a 90% chance of such a massive
disaster within the next 1,000 years.) Unlike Civilization
Archive’s supporters, most Artifactists believe that recov-
ery from such an event is close to impossible.
Faced with this apparently inevitable disaster, the
Artifactists believe that the purpose of art in the 22nd
century should be to create objects that will both provide
clear evidence of intelligent design and withstand the
ravages of the mankind’s collapse. It should also survive
geological and even cosmological spans of time, so that
some millions or even billions of years later the next
intelligence to arise in this region of the galaxy will know
that human and human-derived life once existed. While
most Artifactists are sympathetic to proposals to bury
evidence of humanity deep in Lunar lava tubes on in a
time capsule on Callisto (see p. DB50), they feel that
such efforts are not artistically meaningful.
So far most Artifactist projects have been subtle; the
creation of artificial asteroids is a popular approach. Vari-
ous methods have been used to fulfill their artistic goals in
these asteroids: unusual geometric shapes were in vogue
at the beginning of the movement, but fell out of favor
with the realization that eons of microcollisions would
erode away the features. The current trend is to place
within a given asteroid’s body an amount of rare but non-
radioactive metals, with the ratio of different metals’
weights as nearly equal as possible to significant mathe-
matic constants.
Others, taking their cues from nature, seek to create
fossils that leave a clear message of humanity’s existence.
This particular approach uses fairly elaborate schema to
indicate which planet in the system humans evolved on, at
what point in the Sun’s life human civilization arose, and
so forth. Most recently, some Artifactist pioneers have
journeyed to the furthest reaches of the solar system, where
they sculpt Kuiper belt objects and then gently push them
out toward interstellar space on a very long orbital arc
around the Sun.
These installations require substantial resources to
create, and most carry corporate sponsorships. Some Arti-
factists decry the debasement of the project, while others
accept it with the knowledge that in several million or
more years nobody will really understand who “Columbia
Aerospace” or “Xiao Chu” were . . . if the logos in the art
even survive.

ALTERNATIVE CULTURE
TRANSHUMAN STYLE: 
VIRTUAL CLOTHING
Usually found in locations where VIIs are ubiqui-
tous, virtual clothes are v-tag-embedded outfits that
show up as elaborate and sometimes physically impos-
sible clothing when viewed by someone with a virtual
interface. In reality, most are simple gray jumpsuits,
although in some cases the virtual images are meant to
accent already elaborate physical clothing. A few
designers make virtual outfits that are worn only as a
belt; anything else the user wears is entirely optional. 
Virtual clothes are commonly worn by people who
have to wear specific and greatly divergent outfits in dif-
ferent settings, and wish to avoid having to change
clothes over the course of a day. The ability of virtual
clothes to display a wide assortment of images makes
them sought after for high-fashion gatherings as well. At
some events every attendee wears virtual clothing. The
software for virtual clothing is able to correctly respond
to a wearer’s position and movement, although occa-
sional errors occur. There is also a vaguely intangible
quality to the virtual-clothing image and commercial
versions are unsuited for disguise.
Few people who wear virtual clothing create the
fashions themselves, and there is a thriving market for
attractive and innovative designs. New styles can easily
be found and downloaded. Given that the v-tags can sig-
nal nearly any image, clothing designs based on rare or
impossible materials are fairly common. Some of the
more outlandish virtual outfits include waterfalls,
flames, living creatures, or even black holes – outfits

abstain from sex, both physical and virtual. They’re
likely out of touch with popular culture, much of
which is based on selling intense experiences and charis-
matic personalities. For the same reason, they’re not much
involved in consumer capitalism, preferring simple and
durable goods to trendy new items. This doesn’t mean that
they’re poor; many are well off and have excellent credit,
helped by a philosophy that favors long-term planning
over immediate pleasures. Ataractics favor simple, conser-
vative clothes and minimal biosculpture, styled to avoid
sex appeal and personal display. Paradoxically, some peo-
ple find this idiom alluring – the fantasy of being the one
person who gets through an Ataractic’s reserve has given
rise to a great deal of fiction and drama. 
Perhaps the biggest departure of the Ataractics from
most philosophies is that they don’t usually call
themselves Ataractics, or argue for their beliefs.
This isn’t from fear of persecution, but from
the belief that intellectual argument is one
more source of chemical reward, driven
by the same aggressive and territorial
impulses as sports and warfare.
Ataractics who discuss their beliefs
and lifestyles usually just describe
them as personal preferences. If
they recommend them to other
people, it’s as an individual’s
choice, not in the name of loyalty
to a philosophy. 
Ataraxia is a minority belief
system, and is likely to remain so,
especially since its adherents are
determinedly low-key and avoid
proselytizing. Transhumanists in
Fifth Wave societies often sympa-
thize with its goal, a life of detachment
from physiologically driven emotions,
but prefer more technological methods of
attaining this, from genetic modifications to
brain implants and uploading into computers.
Its strongest appeal is in Third and Fourth Wave
cultures that share Transhumanist aspirations but can’t
afford to realize them technologically; attaining self-
mastery through training and discipline appeals to them.
Thailand, with its Theravada Buddhist culture, is an
emerging center of Ataractic belief. The emergence of sig-
nificant upwardly mobile groups following Ataractic disci-
plines gives the meme a respectful hearing. In a larger
sense, the Ataractic meme is fairly widespread in the late
21st century – most visions of transhuman or posthuman
life include some aspects of it, often not explicitly so
labeled.
In game terms, most Ataratics have the skills Philoso-
phy (Ataraxia) and Meditation; serious practitioners have
a Discipline of Faith worth -5 points.
Ataraxia 
Beyond the needs of survival – shelter, warmth,
nutrition, safety, comforting affection of others – all
else is constructed. Yet these constructed desires feel as
real as – or even more real than! – our basic mam-
malian needs. We have built our cultures around relent-
less attempts to satisfy these artificial urges, but by
their very nature we can never fully meet their
demands. A truly human culture recognizes this, and
helps us step away from false needs and toward true
contentment.
– Bailey Raines,
Ataraxia: A New Way of Living, 2044
Ataraxia, which dates from the 2010s, is an emerging
cultural memeplex with values that appeal to many
Transhumanists, especially in Asia. It has also
gained supporters in less-prosperous nations,
where its disciplines are seen as an afford-
able alternative to genetic or technological
upgrades. 
The word “Ataraxia” actually
comes from ancient Greek. The
philosopher Epicurus taught that every
need or desire was a trouble to the
mind, and that the ideal life was one
of limited and easily satisfied desires.
Andrew Baird, a neuropsychological
researcher at Edinburgh, used the
word in his essays on the educational
and ethical implications of neuro-
science and adherents of his views
adopted it. 
Baird’s central idea was that a large
part of human behavior and motivation
is driven by chemical reward mechanisms
in the brain, and therefore similar to addic-
tion. Just as heroin addicts crave heroin, he
said, other people can crave gambling, sex, or
violence, and can make self-destructive choices
under that craving’s influence. He proposed both a way
of life that prevented such cravings from arising and spe-
cific disciplines that controlled them and quieted the mind.
Ataractics tend to be religiously agnostic. The move-
ment doesn’t reject religious doctrines, but considers
intense religious experience to be a source of craving and
best avoided. For the same reason, they avoid political
mass movements, especially militaristic ones. Many
Ataractics live quiet, productive lives, with occasional
retreats to cultivate peace of mind; some move into isolat-
ed villages that minimize undesirable stimuli. Most gov-
ernments find Ataractics harmless, but totalitarian regimes
that demand active commitment are often hostile to them. 
Ataractics don’t drink or use other psychoactive
drugs. Many are celibate – even married couples may

“Melody was a Felicia II ordered in 2090 by a gen-

for her to be given courtesan training, however, so his

to be freed from her biofac, this gentleman suffered a
fatal encounter with vacuum. As he left no heirs, and
his estate was bound up by the authorities, Melody

Raising a child is a time-consuming and stressful
process. Changing its diapers, supervising its exposure to
hostile memes, making sure it gets a good education, and
dealing with teenage rebellion . . . Even with state-of-the-
art child care technology, child-rearing can be overwhelm-
ing for a parent, even more so when it all goes wrong and
the child turns out nothing like he, she, or hir expected.
This is why some hopeful parents decide not to have a
child the “traditional” way and watch it grow from a baby
to an adult, but commission a bioroid “child” instead and
adopt it. Bioroids emerge from the biofac fully grown,
exactly like the “parents” want it to look, and already have
a basic education and personality according to the adoptive
parents’specifications. All they lack is life experience, and
providing this is a pleasant and relatively less-stressful

The world’s best-known Ataractic is not actually a prac-
titioner of Ataraxian disciplines. She has no actual need for
them, being an infomorph without hormones, neurotrans-
mitters, or other potentially addictive reward mechanisms.
Atene is a character in a long-running digital kingdom, Paci-
fica, and has many followers in the Pacific Rim Alliance,
especially Thailand and Korea, and an increasing number
from the United States, in particular in the Pacific coastal
states. Over the 10 years since Pacifica was opened for
access, her increasing popularity resulted in her access to
computing resources being upgraded; eventually she awoke
as an emergent SAI. She has no identity other than the role
she plays; in fact, she actually believes in the values written
into that role and consciously makes use of her part to pro-
mote Ataraxian beliefs. This has resulted in her coming up
with ingenious conflict resolutions within the Pacifica set-
ting. Her originality and authenticity have gained her a
wider following.
Her situation is a precarious one, as PRA law classifies
her as an abomination; if her sapience were discovered she
would likely be erased. She has accepted this and resolved
to submit if so judged, hoping to be a witness for peaceful
coexistence between AIs and humanity. Since Ataraxia dis-
courages martyrdom though, she doesn’t find it necessary to
reveal herself. In fact, she willingly submerges herself in
playing her role as well as possible. The current manage-
ment is well aware of her virtual persona as a long-term
asset and intends to maintain it. It’s possible that if they dis-
covered her sapience, they might try to conceal it from the
law rather than lose her services.
While on the Pacifica macroframe Atene has access to a
wide variety of skill sets, including a number of improbable
skills that have functions limited to the virtual simulation.

and even gene therapy have been tried and found to
have varying and occasionally positive results. But
much more substantial progress has been made on other
fronts. Nanomachine artery cleaners remove and repair
sclerotic tissue and drug regimens reduce blood pressure
and scrub unhealthy levels of harmful substances from
the blood. Tissue damaged by the general wear-and-
tear of an obese body simply moving around is
replaced with new, stronger tissues, and treatments to
improve muscle strength and efficiency are employed
just as readily on a heavy person as on a thin one. It is
simply no longer unhealthy to be fat or even obese.
So people eat and enjoy eating, and stop when they
wish to stop without feeling guilty about it. Of course, 
airlines do charge extra for heavy passengers, and space-
lines charge by the kilogram. But with the rise in tele-
tourism and virtual conferencing, airlines tend not to be
too restrictive in their pricing. And while relatively few
people travel by spaceliner, if you are massive and need to
travel between planets, then there are many rapid and
effective means of losing weight.
As bioroids can be designed using a vast array
of templates and features, bioroids chosen for adoption
vary greatly. Some parents prefer to commission a bioroid
designed to look fully human, often a human closely relat-
ed to the family. Others adopt bioroids based on more
exotic templates, reasoning that such bioroids will
rarely want for work and acceptance once they
have moved into the real world. A small number
of adoptive parents take on bioroids that, for a
variety of reasons, could not be accepted by the
company or person placing the original order.
Such occasions are rare, but not unknown; the most
respected abandoned-bioroid adoption facility is the Gia-
petto Society, based outside of Cape Town, South Africa.
This practice is found primarily in South Africa and a
growing number of space colonies, especially Islandia, as
few locations have the necessary technology, legal permis-
sions to manufacture bioroids to specs, and full civil rights
for bioroids. On Earth, only South Africa combines the
three in a way that makes bioroid adoption a real possibil-
ity, and it is highly controversial even there. Small num-
bers of bioroid-adoptive families can be found in the PRA,
the United States, and Europe; China has begun
offering incentives for parents to raise
bioroid and parahumans, but the response
has not been significant. Adoptive parents
form a very close-knit community, even if
separated by distance, and often pass along
tips and insights from their own experience
to new parents; some have provided finan-
cial or legal support for parents suffering
social or official harassment for their choice.

TRANSHUMAN STYLE: 
THE BOLLYWOOD MOOSH
With the dominance of Bollywood in the global-entertainment mar-
kets throughout much of the century, many small and fairly harmless
memes have been exported from Indian culture to the rest of the world
via Bollywood movies and InVids. Among these is a global resurgence
in popularity of the moustache, or “moosh,” as Indians call it.
In Indian culture, the moosh signifies male virility and adulthood.
In Bollywood productions, the moosh is a traditional signifier of male
roles: a pencil-thin line denotes the hero, while the villain commonly
sports a more luxuriant growth. In 2100, many of masculine inclination
grow moustaches or have them implanted after the Bollywood models.
A thin moosh gives an impression of dashing bravura, while a thick one
indicates a more sensual and untamed sexuality. To be a proper moosh,
of course, a moustache has to be as dark as possible; men with very
blonde, very red, or very gray hair sporting deep black mooshes are
common humor elements in slapstick InVids.
In 2093, the moosh briefly became a point of controversy, as the
fading Bollywood actor Salman Kumar attempted to register his mous-
tache style with the WTO as a protected property. While he was well
known for the thick moosh that extended over his upper lip, several
Bollywood studios and countless moustache wearers filed their opposi-
tion with the organization. After initially hinting that they would give
Kumar the right to the “moosh design,” the WTO eventually ruled that
it was already established in the public domain. In protest, Kumar
shaved his moosh; the ridicule he suffered from this episode effectively
ended his Bollywood career.

“Lean and healthy” remains a popular look for the
wealthy, as it suggests access to advanced metabolic
biotechnology and perhaps even being born with a super-
efficient genetic upgrade. Being heavy no longer carries
the same stigma as it had in decades past, however, and
many of the most popular performers and models would
have been considered “plump” a century earlier. This is
only the case for Earth, however – most space-based com-
munities retain a negative reaction to fat people.
Burners
“In the past, art was everlasting and life was
ephemeral. Nowadays, the opposite is true.”
– Heather Mackenzie, Burner Flock 72
Burners are a subculture found primarily in North
America, although community members can be anywhere.
Most are Eloi who have decided that transient art is the
highest form of self-expression. As a result, they spend
much of their time creating artwork that is destroyed – 
usually by burning, hence their name. Most Burners are
between 15 and 40 years old, although an increasing 
number of older Burners are remaining with the com-
munity. Burner culture has existed in various forms
since the 20th century, but saw its greatest growth since
2080.
Burners tend to travel in “flocks” numbering 20 to
500, with most around 150; Burner flocks often split rela-
tively amicably once they get too large. There are about
250 flocks in North America, and about 30 in South Africa,
five in Europe, and a couple dozen in Australia. They are
fairly transient, remaining in one location for no more than
two weeks. Established Burners often follow a cycle of
camps, although some groups make a point of never going
back to the same place twice. Burners generally camp in
relatively sparsely populated areas, if only to avoid 
problems with local authorities.

of ancient Pueblo culture has been hotly debated for
over a century. In his research, Ashewequa became
convinced it had been true and accepted it as a way to
return to his ancestry. The Cibola Cultural Preservation
Office fervently denies the shaman’s claims, but cannot at
this point do anything about it.
Since Ashewequa’s first act of clonibalism, a handful
other priests of ancient and New Age religions have fol-
lowed suit. In most cases – due to cost, time, and in many
cases ethical constraints – only partial clones, tissue, or
organs are created for these rites. Particular organs are
eaten for specific spiritual attributes, depending on the reli-
gion. For example, the heart may be eaten for strength or
the brain for wisdom. Congregations often share their
cloned organs with fellow worshippers as part of
their rituals. Some clonibal gatherings can be
quite gruesome.
The entire subculture of clonibalism is con-
stantly under attack from pansapient-rights
groups and others simply offended by the very
notion . . . which are many. Making matters worse
are those clonnibals who have taken the idea a step far-
ther. To make the killing more satisfying, some clones are
quickly grown to full size via biogenesis techniques and
completed just enough to make them living and breathing,
if not fully functional.
This latter technique may have spread beyond cloni-
bal groups. In 2098, TEN reported a controversial therapy,
called Self-Annihilation and Rebirth, where a person’s
nonsapient clone is murdered to rid the patient of self-
loathing or self-destructiveness. Claims of black-market
clones bought by wealthy “murder clubs” to hunt down are
also known, but are largely thought to be apocryphal. As
such activities violate human-rights laws, even if the vic-
tim clones are not sapient, any groups suspected of either
are vigorously prosecuted.
This subculture has spread throughout areas where
cannibalistic rites were once popular and cloning is
known. It is also slowly growing in places where New Age
religions mix with advanced technology, such as the Unit-
ed States, European Union, and L5 colonies. Proponents
claim there is little difference between clonibalism and the
eating of faux flesh and many can see that point, even if
they still find it repulsive.
In the eyes of many, clonibalism is closely related to
the consumption of sentient snacks (p. DB114), a claim
hotly denied by both clonibals and sentient-snack manu-
facturers. Clonibalism involves eating an organ or piece of
flesh genetically identical to one’s own, while sentient
snacks are little more than syrup-filled bioroids. This mat-
ters little to critics, however, who cite both as examples of
moral decay and sheer decadence in society . . . Or, as Erk
Chattermore puts it, “I don’t understand what you humans
eat. On one plate, you have something telling you your
butt’s too big, and on the other plate, you have the
proof!”
The behavior of Burner flocks can vary widely,
with some trying to shock more mainstream commu-
nities with their “wild” ways and others trying to be as
respectful as possible. Burner camps are infamous for
brainbug use and other licentious behaviors, but some
Burners are almost Ataraxic in their restraint (see p. 83).
All emphasize creativity and artwork, however, and many
Burners use a very broad interpretation of the word “art.”
Burner camps are usually filled with music and visual dis-
plays and most welcome visits from outsiders wishing to
learn and create. At the end of each camp, all of the art-
work is destroyed in a community ritual. Most Burners
don’t want to have any of their art recorded, and many dis-
courage the use of virtual interfaces.
Burner flocks get together annually for the Big
Burn, which is usually held in abandoned urban
areas. Flocks aren’t required to attend, as that
would violate the spirit of the event, but they are
encouraged to do so. Burner flocks on different
continents coordinate the timing of the Big Burns
in order to allow enthusiastic members to attend all
of them. At the Big Burn, flocks try to out-do each other
with art projects and potlatch-style gifting.
Clonibalism
“Anyone who says that the human heart ‘tastes like
chicken’ has never eaten a human heart. I have, and I
can tell you: a heart – at least my heart – tastes noth-
ing like chicken. A heart’s tough and chewy. It’s bitter.
And it definitely went better with red wine than with
white.”
– Kevin Chen,
I’ll Do Anything Once. Yes, Even That
A term coined by TEN commentator Skiff Alinoa,
“clonibalism” is the act of eating cloned human flesh. For
most practitioners, it is more symbolic than epicurean. The
practice is a relatively recent one, and highly controversial.
Those practicing clonibalism hate the term – they prefer
“self consumption” – but it has stuck.
Cannibalism has been accepted as a religious rite in
many cultures through time, and has been seen in cases
induced by starvation as well. But as Western influence
spread through the world, ritualistic cannibalism was
replaced with symbolic rites or wiped out all together.
While outsiders have always viewed cannibalism as bar-
barous, its spiritual aspect has usually been that of drawing
strength from the eaten. 
With the advent of accessible and affordable cloning
technologies, clonibalism hit center stage in 2088. Despite
a fairly accepting global attitude toward most experimen-
tal practices, many were shocked and repulsed when a
Hopi elder and shaman, Marcus Ashewequa, ate a clone of
his own heart in a tribal ritual. Ashewequa had always
been a strong proponent of returning to the ways of the
Hopi ancestors. Whether or not cannibalism was part

Medusas are sophisticated headwear, typically worn by
long-haired women, found among Eloi in Europe, China, and
the more fashion-forward Duncanite enclaves. The Medusa
is a tiny mechanism that functions as an endoskeleton for
hair, which is wrapped around its multiple snake-like arma-
tures. Typical Medusas have from eight to 20 snakes. As the
advertising around Medusas emphasizes the Greek mytho-
logical roots, only women are encouraged to wear them –
some Medusa manufacturers go so far as to make their model
shut down if the device detects it is being worn by a genetic
male. 
It takes upwards of an hour to perform the initial instal-
lation of a Medusa, as the hair must be threaded through the
unit, wrapped around each snake, and nanogelled into place.
Coloring is often applied with the nanogel. Each snakehead
has small camera eyes and a functional mouth able to speak,
usually only in a hiss. Some also snap, although rarely
enough to cause damage. Once installed, a wearer must
return to a salon for at least monthly maintenance; if she is
unable to do so, the Medusa will go dormant (see below)
until the next maintenance session.
The base of the Medusa is linked to the wearer’s virtual-
interface implant; salons refuse to install a Medusa on some-
one without a VII. The wearer can see through the “eyes” of
the snakes at will – which can be very confusing, but is some-
times useful for looking backwards. Once activated, the
snakes have three modes: dormant, in which they lie flat,
appearing more or less like normal hair, albeit with snake
heads at the ends; autonomous, in which the snakes writhe,
hiss, and look around on their own; and controlled, where the
wearer can issue various commands to the snakes. Medusas
are often designed to respond to the wearer’s emotional state
– hissing when angry, writhing quickly when excited, gently
rippling when happy, etc. Medusas make use of solar power,
electrostatic power from the wearer’s skin, and a B cell,
which must be replaced annually.
Medusas are not common, although most people are
familiar with them from media appearances and not fright-
ened to see one in person. Costs for Medusas vary greatly by
designer. While the component hardware is not inherently
expensive, prices are often inflated for fashionable brands. In
addition, each manufacturer provides its own heavily copy-
right-protected behavioral software, and much of the differ-
entiation between designers is based not on the Medusa’s
physical appearance, but on how lifelike, artistic, or subtle
the snake behavior is.
Specialized Medusas with the ability to spit poison, acid,
or nanoweapons have appeared in various adventure InVid,
but are not known to be real – although such a modification
is possible . . .

vast majority of the audiences are much older people –
mostly men, but not exclusively – who have far less

determine whether they have a traditional “death wish” or

expressed interest in some of the events, there is a strong
biochauvinist undercurrent in the danger-sports world.

“My wife asked, as she left me, what was next –
fighting sharks? I told her not to be ridiculous. A shark
would be too easy. She didn’t laugh.”
– Tommy Marquez,
Danger Sportsman of the Year 2097,
in an interview a week before his death 
in the 2099 Tetrathalon
According to the pundits, death is now far less popu-
lar than it used to be, and a substantial number of people
hope to avoid it entirely. Life, according to the enthusiasts
of so-called “danger sports,” has suffered a similar drop in
popularity: teletourism, VR sex, and even virtual-interface
glasses divorce people from the real world. Advanced
medical techniques, up to and including emergency brain-
peeling, remove the fear of danger that gives zest to life.
And the engineering of human life itself has even removed
the fun of competitive sports! The decline of the Olympic
Games resulting from the radical improvement in human
bioengineering was not compensated by events celebrating
such technologies, such as the Kyoto Cup HuGEX Games,
which many critics deride as crass advertising for genetic-
engineering firms. Many people looking for an athletic
thrill now turn to danger sports.
Proponents of danger sports pit themselves against the
universe in order to feel alive. More often than not the par-
ticipants eventually end up dead or nearly so. In one noto-
rious event, the annual Real Men on the Moon race – 50
meters across the Lunar surface without vacc suits! – every
participant requires hospitalization at the end of the run
and each year two to five suffer irreversible brain damage.
The Olympus Mons Free Climb is a race to scale the vol-
cano’s two-and-a-half mile high northwest escarpment
without using ropes or specialized climbing gear; last year,
three climbers fell to their deaths.
Their activities are condemned by authorities as a dan-
ger to themselves and others: the space-drop stage of a
tetrathalon, for example, has about a 50% chance of per-
manently killing one competitor per event, and on one
occasion severely injured an observer. The 2099
tetrathalon killed Tommy Marquez, long one of the most-
famous danger sportsmen. The winner of the event,
Alphonse Nsanze of Burundi, is now a regular guest on
InVid talk shows, and just signed a contract for an upslink
implant to record his next Real Men on the Moon run.
Danger sports are gaining in popularity, not only with
the competitors but with the spectators. VR sims, after all,
can only give the illusion of personal risk; intellectually, no
matter how good the simulation, the user knows that he is
in no danger. To stand in an audience watching a jetpack
race, knowing that an all-too-possible mistake in piloting
could cause not only the death of the pilot, but also that of
crowd members, brings the entire experience into sharp
focus. The difficulty of obtaining access to these oft-
illicit events only serves to reinforce the meme. For

Ever since man moved into space full time, the
quest for comfortable, useful, and attractive zero-gee
clothing has been an ongoing one. A variety of outfit
designs have come and gone over the decades, but one
item has stuck around: the tabi. Based on the Japanese
split-toe slipper, the so-called “spacer tabi” allows for
comfort when walking in positive-gee environments and
the ability to use the crude gripping ability of toes in zero
gee. 
In the late 2080s, spacer tabi suddenly became pop-
ular on Earth. Nearly all are made with memswear (see
p. TS146), allowing them to function as relaxation slip-
pers as well as outdoor footwear. Good spacer tabi can
be worn in nearly any environment, although they are
not recommended for extreme cold (below 0° F). 
Spacer tabi come in a wider variety of color and fabric
on Earth than they do in space, and have become popu-
lar in most urban settings. Most adults in Fourth and
Fifth Wave countries have at least one pair of spacer tabi
in the closet.
Spacer tabi (standard): $50, 1-2 lbs.; Spacer tabi
(all-weather): $150, 2 lbs.

Hard Edge is a fairly popular music style heard in
dance clubs and on the streets of many cities. It com-
bines elements of Soft Edge music and traditional rock
(see p. FW44), and is most known for the elaborate
dances many Hard Edgers engage in at concerts.
Hard Edge pop culture presents the image of
a harsh environment of dancing competi-
tions and youthful bravado. It is most com-
mon in cultures where the population is
much older than the global average –
Japan, Korea, and much of western Europe.
In her seminal 2097 documentary Step-
ping Off, Marcy Park followed the lives of a
group of Hard Edgers in Seoul. She discovered that the
external signs of aggression and display – the hard
leather clothing, the shaved heads, the overtly sexual
postures – masked fairly normal and rather shy
teenagers. This was somewhat expected, as Park admit-
ted, as it followed teen patterns for generations. What
was not predicted is the degree of cooperation between
Hard Edger gangs in preparation for dance competitions,
known worldwide as “circles.”
Each Hard Edger group seeks to develop its own
style of dance, but does so in part by paying close atten-
tion to the evolution of other groups’ moves. This isn’t
spying – the goal is to find out what not to do, because
copying another gang’s routine, even inadvertently, is
shameful. The aggressiveness and shouting during the
dance circles is part of the overall performance, and
Park was able to decode some of the connections
between seemingly violent displays in the audience
and dance moves in the circle itself.
Stepping Off, while critically acclaimed, did not
receive wide attention, and the popular perception of
Hard Edgers remains that they are youth gangs to be
avoided. In a 2099 interview on the Spinner memenet,
Park lamented that by avoiding Hard Edge circles, art
audiences were missing out on some of the most-orig-
inal dance performances around. Park was dismayed
by the attention given to the more lyrical but in her
words “much more superficial” Soft Edge movement
(see Soft Edgers, p. 94). In this, her opinion matches
the contempt many Hard Edgers have for Soft Edgers.
While the tough reputation of Hard Edgers means
that they may suffer from police harassment and pop-
ular suspicion, it does often result in occasional
employment as bodyguards, bouncers, and other jobs
requiring the employee to look intimidating.

– From The Golden Jihad:
Episode 79, The Spiral Path, 2068
In 2065, a small production company in pre-TSA
Indonesia created an InVid show called The Golden
Jihad, a science-fantasy epic set in a world that echoed
elements of the Arabian Nights, but with a variety of
technology twists. The main villains were robots, the fly-
ing carpets could travel between planets using something
called an “Ebony Gate,” and the evil Sultan Koh lived on
a vast starship. It quickly developed a small-but-loyal
following around the world, overshadowed by the much
more widespread popularity of Starburst Station (see p.
HF126). The show lasted for 50 episodes, but suspended
production when the political situation in Indonesia grew
chaotic. About a year later, the producers moved to
Lebanon and created another 150 episodes before ceas-
ing production entirely in 2071. They then returned to
Indonesia, where they worked on TSA propaganda
and more-conventional entertainment programs.

In 2081, the WTO tried to shut down these copy-
right violations, but the original producers of the show
pointedly refused to participate in the proceedings. They
stated that they believed that the fans should own the
show. As a result, over the last 25 years amateur produc-
tions of Golden Jihad stories have become the most
widely seen homebrew InVids on the Web. Most of the
fan episodes are really bad, but a few – including the fea-
ture-length Al-Azar on the Red Planet, made in 2084 –
are cult classics. The only homemade Golden Jihad
InVids that the WTO goes after are those which violate
other copyrights, such as the subversive and now very
hard to find Al-Azar Meets the Eternal Commander, a
2094 InVid in which a damaged Ebony Gate transports
Al-Azar and friends to the Starburst Station.
Although no official releases have been made for
nearly 30 years, The Golden Jihad remains one of the
more widely recognized fantasy-adventure stories
around. Some of its catch phrases – most notably “this
can’t be good . . .” – are known worldwide. Ironically,
the show is now considered suspect in the Islamic
Caliphate, although smuggled copies are readily found
in local markets. 
There are several dozen active Jihadi
websites and memenets, along with several
different “shared universes” for collabora-
tive storytelling. Two different Golden
Jihad virtual kingdoms compete for partici-
pants. One is hosted on the TSA Web in Peru,
where there is a surprisingly fanatical following
of the show, and the other is on the mainstream Web
in Singapore. Nearly 100 sites on the Web provide digi-
tal sets and background characters for people making
their own Golden Jihad episodes. Jihadis consider them-
selves to be more “co-creators” than fans, and some
express disdain the slavish devotion to someone else’s
work as seen in the fans of Starburst Station.
Copies of the show
continued to float around
the Web, and were easily
found on the TSA Web. No
more would be made, how-
ever, and the production
company stated bluntly that
it had no interest in doing
big-budget versions in Bolly-
wood. In 2077, a fan created a
full-length episode using com-
mon home-production tools; this
installment quickly became wildly popular
among other Jihad fans. Soon “Jihadis” (as they called
themselves) around the world were making their own
episodes of Golden Jihad to share with other fans and
occasionally to sell.

TRANSHUMAN STYLE: HATS
In many cultures, headwear was a tradi-
tional part of a standard outfit until the latter
half of the 20th century. Epidemics of skin can-
cer resulting from the ozone layer thinning in
the early to mid-21st century led to a resurgence
in their use, and hats remain popular, especially
in Australia and New Zealand, southern South
America, southern Africa, and northern Europe.
Hats and other headwear are far less common in
the United States than in much of the rest of the
world, aside from immigrant communities. 
Given that the reason for wearing hats is as
much for health as for fashion, certain designs
are much less common than others. Skin cancer
from UV exposure occurs most often on the
ears, nose, and the top of the head, so hats have
to cover more than a typical baseball cap in
order to be effective. Depending on region and
culture, wide-brimmed hats, head wraps and
scarves, or keffiyeh-style headwear are the most
common. Many modern hats integrate virtual-
interface elements.
Different cultures have different rules for
the propriety of wearing headdresses indoors,
although in most locations it is largely accept-
able outside of formal situations. The spread of
the ability to cure most cancers easily, com-
bined with persistent skin protection gels, is
leading to the decline of hats as fashion. Still,
more than half the adults outside of the U.S.
wear headgear of some sort.
Radio put technology into

The New Virginity
Dear AdviceSystem3000:
My husband and I have been married for over a
decade now, and are still very much in love. Recently,
he was diagnosed with Rafferty’s Syndrome, a serious
neurological condition. He’ll be fine, fortunately,
except that for the next two years he’ll be in nano treat-
ment and he can’t use a virtual interface. At all.
We’re working out arrangements for his profes-
sional life, but there’s a bigger issue. We’ve only ever
been intimate through our virtual interfaces. The idea
of going without for the next two years is staggering for
him, and I want to be a loving partner. But I really don’t
even know where to start. Help!
Signed,
First Night After 10 Years
– From an anonymous advice 
memenet, 2099
The virtual-interface implant has proven an invaluable
aid for all sorts of purposes, not
least of which is sex. Using
VIIs, two or more lovers can
share any kind of scenario in
any setting; they may do so
even if separated by a city,
continent, or ocean. The
details of the scenario can be
different for each participant,
and with imaginative pro-
gramming and a little flexi-
bility stimuli can even be
mapped onto utterly dissimi-
lar experiences. The experi-
ence can be recorded and
played back later when
alone, and busy lovers may
even send eidolons of them-
selves to a virtual rendezvous
to record the experience and
replay the scenario later.
VR sex can be so rewarding that many find the ex-
perience of real-world sex comparatively uncomfortable,
inconvenient, disappointing, and frankly . . . messy. Cou-
pled with the occasional scare-memes of horrible
nanoviruses spread by sexual contact, many with VIIs
eschew real sex altogether. There are married couples who
have never “gotten messy” with each other in the real
world, being perfectly content with their shared virtual
seraglios. And there are those who, having experienced
VR sex since puberty, and being put off by a few peers
who have tried real-world sex, have never gotten messy
with anybody and perhaps never will.
Since sex and reproduction have long since gone their
separate ways, concerns about this situation are 
minimal. Indeed, since the meme of virginity being a
precious thing has never truly gone away, many par-
ents find themselves pleased with the idea of offspring
who will never lose this most precious possession and yet
will still have fulfilling lives. They are less pleased with
the idea of secret VR licentiousness, but are willing to
accept the trade-off.
This “new virginity” has been a recognized social
phenomenon in Europe for the last decade at least, and
probably was evident a decade earlier. It is of growing sig-
nificance in the SAC and PRA. As American culture has
long been squeamish about the use of prurient VR-ware
by teens, the rate of physical activity in the United States
hasn’t dropped nearly as much as in other advanced
regions. China, conversely, has encouraged the use of vir-
tual sexual experiences for as long as they’ve been avail-
able, as a way of managing population growth.
The “new virginity” meme pops up infrequently in
popular media, largely in stories where the virtually ex-
perienced but physically virginal partners are stuck in a
setting where VR relationships are impossible.

I think the final straw was seeing Gram and Grep
at the Halloween party carrying their anti-Andes War

While many people harbor some rejectionist memes,
few people know that the continued propagation of reject-
ionism in a world where technological consumerism is a
dominant memeplex is in part the result of a long-lasting
memetic campaign. A distributed, anarchic, and otherwise
fractious group calling itself “Just Stop It” has been engag-
ing in this guerrilla memetic campaign for the last 50
years. Just Stop It claims a variety of “culture jammer” and
anticonsumerist groups as its philosophical forebears. Just
Stop It gets very little media attention, and goes out of its
way to avoid the spotlight, but its rejectionist campaign has
been very successful. Just Stop It members are anony-
mous, even to each other – people aware of the group
would be surprised to learn that most members work in the
advertising profession!
There is a pop-memetics concept that all people
have “identity decades,” a point in their lives when
they are most familiar with emerging ideas, trends, and
culture. For many people, this decade is usually when
they are in their 20’s, but in some cases it can be much
later in a person’s life. For the vast majority, once the
“identity decade” passes, people are stuck feeling
increasingly out of it and nostalgic for the time when life
made more sense. But in a world where people spend the
vast majority of their lives in the years after their “iden-
tity decade,” nostalgia for past greatness is a common
emotion.
In 2100, nostalgia is everywhere. It manifests in vehi-
cle design, public-space design, advertising, clothing,
entertainment . . . all manner of popular culture. In much
of the United States and Europe, public manifestations of
nostalgia have been seemingly stuck in the 2040s and
2050s, roughly the “identity decade” of the so-called “Out-
break Generation” (see p. FW28). A noticeable portion of
everyday life in most American and European urban cen-
ters – ambient music, restaurants, InVids – contains refer-
ences to life in the 40s and 50s, and most people, even
those born long after the era, understand the references. As
Outbreakers continue to hold civic and corporate leader-
ship positions, this is not likely to change any time soon.
Rejectionism
“Don’t want it, don’t need it, already happy with-
out it. Seems reason enough not to get it.”
– Phrase posted throughout the 
What Do I Buy Now?!? website 
by an anonymous prankster
Rejectionism is opposition to the use of certain tech-
nologies; the technologies vary, depending upon who
holds the meme. Rejectionism sometimes stands on its
own, but in many cases is a memetic “add-on.” There is no
rejectionist movement or ideology per se, but rejectionism
shows up as an element in many different philosophies.
The meme’s manifestation within this variety of meme-
plexes is remarkably consistent.
It’s important to note that rejectionism opposes the use
of a technology, not its existence. For example, biochau-
vinists who wish to destroy SAIs and SAI-creation tech-
nology are not rejectionists. But if those same
biochauvinists refuse to wear virtual interfaces because
they include NAIs, but don’t really care if others do, then
they have adopted a rejectionist opinion about VIIs and
VIGs. Rejectionism is rarely activist.
Rejectionism usually appears as an element in an indi-
vidual’s personal lifestyle. Such attitudes are adopted for a
wide array of reasons. Some people cite a technology’s
impact on their health, some ethical objections, and some
simply because they just don’t like the way the technology
changes people. Common rejectionist focuses include
nanotechnology, implants, virtual interfaces of all

Soft Edgers
The sail unfurls,
The ocean rises,
Your touch is my wind.
– From Opus 19, by Elegiac
Soft Edge is one of the currently popular musical
styles (see pp. 89-90), and can be heard at gatherings of
young people around the world. The music is melodic and
romantic, and the pop culture surrounding the music tends
to be equally dreamy. In contrast with Hard Edgers (see 
pp. 89-90), Soft Edgers adopt a much friendlier, calmer
attitude around outsiders. Puffy, lacey tunics, elaborate
makeup, and extensive use of digital hair and nanomorphic
tattoos (see p. TS146) are commonplace among Soft
Edgers. The overall image of the subculture is that of a lov-
ing, almost sappy community. The media celebrates Soft
Edgers as what all young people should be.
This is not an entirely realistic appraisal, however.
Soft Edger groups, often called “nests,” are strictly hierar-
chical, and dominance is asserted not by violence but by
ruthless words. For Soft Edgers who know their place in
the nest, their experiences can be as loving and tender as
outsiders imagine. But the moment a Soft Edger steps out-
side of his assigned role, the group can turn vindictive.
Leaders of Soft Edge nests make a point of learning
whatever details they can about their underlings, par-
ticularly secret, scandalous bits that can be used to cut
them down if necessary. Members rise and fall in the nest
hierarchy on the basis of cutting word play. This verbal
jousting can go on for hours as each combatant attempts to
be more boastful, more insulting, and, critically, more
clever than the other. Crudity is worthless; the most valu-
able attacks are those that don’t sink in immediately. “A
kind word kills slowly” is a favored Soft Edger saying.
One exposé of Soft Edge life referred to it as “Oscar Wilde
meets Machiavelli.”
The Soft Edge subculture has been around for over a
decade now. Many of the original “Transromantics” – the
term some older Soft Edgers used for themselves – have
moved into the adult world. While they no longer wear the
Soft Edge costume, they still embrace the behavioral
rules. Soft Edger adults are viciously manipulative man-
agers and leaders, and some have found a niche for them-
selves in the world of politics. One of the founders of the
movement, Gordon King, will likely be elected mayor of
Atlanta in 2100.
30C
“The old cliché is to act in ways that would not
harm the next seven generations – about 200, 300 years
tops. But when you figure you’re going to live another
thousand years at least, 300 years starts to sound kind
of silly.”
– Barb Mya, on a 30C website
“30C” isn’t a group or movement so much as a media
label, usually used to refer to young Fifth Wavers who
intend to live to and past the year 3000 – although, too
often, the label is used to refer to any person born after
2080. The term first appeared in a 2092 TEN report, “A
Generation at Risk.” Many referred to by the title “30C”
decided that it was worth using, and it’s easy to find squab-
bles all over the youth-oriented parts of the Web between
those who find the label meaningful and those who find it
demeaning. 
Among those who like the term, there are consistent
elements in the ways they’ve chosen to live their lives. The
guiding philosophy of 30C is to make all decisions based
on the question of how those choices will affect the next
900 or more years. Many won’t have any lasting effect,
and being able to recognize which issues have long-term
consequences and which are more transient is a useful
skill. Some 30Cers err on the side of caution, however, and
are prone to be more conservative in their lifestyles than
others in their generational cohort. A small minority of
30Cers focus on the “butterfly effect”-like results of small
decisions, and find themselves trying to make fewer and
fewer choices at all. These individuals tend to drop out of
society and find a nice Isolate community willing to take
them in.

TRANSHUMAN STYLE: 
THE ELOI SUIT
In the mid to late 2090s, the typical outfit of moder-
ately wealthy Fifth Wavers unencumbered by work and
concerned primarily with enjoyment – i.e., the “Eloi” –
consisted of a slim, full-sleeve three-piece outfit (pants
or long skirt, shirt, jacket), loose-fitting but not flowing,
and with no pockets. The color, collar, and details vary
by season and region, but the overall impression is con-
sistent. It is an outfit appropriate for someone who may
be off to a gallery, a party, or a trip into space, and car-
ries everything they need in their virtual-interface
implant.
As of 2100, the style’s popularity has begun to
decline and is seen by many of the more fashion-
oriented Fifth Wavers as being a bit dated. The wide-
spread availability of similar outfits for less elite popula-
tions contributed to this downturn. While various fashion
journals and websites have made solemn predictions
about what will be next, most analysts admit that nobody
quite knows.

As the 30C meme has shown up in a

novelty and structure. They want to see the

Timesicles
“Stay awake for the next 10,000
years? Why on Earth would I want to do
that? I’m curious about what the future
will look like, not curious about how
long it will take me to die of sheer bore-
dom.”
– Comment from Natasha Belkin 
on sci.nanostasis.talk
Many who have a desire to see how
the future unfolds are far too old to take
advantage of new life-extension technolo-
gies and far too uncertain about brainpeel-
ing to become an infomorph. Another
option remains, however: nanostasis.
Properly maintained, a body can remain in
nanostasis indefinitely. Coming out of sta-
sis after a century is no more dangerous
than coming out after a day. People who
choose to use nanostasis to freeze them-
selves into the future are called “timesicles,” a
derisive phrase that many nanostasis enthusiasts nonethe-
less wear proudly.
Few timesicles just set the timer for the year 3000 or
30,000 and slip off to nanodreamland. The vast majority
are curious about what happens along the way and intend
to be awakened either every set number of years or if an
“interesting event” happens – the definition of “interest-
ing” being the subject of extensive interviews between the
prefrozen timesicle and the attendant AI. Once brought out
of stasis, timesicles may simply take a quick look around
and go back to stasis, or may choose to stick around for
awhile. How many will choose which course remains to be
seen, as aside from the particular case noted on p. 96, no
timesicle has yet to emerge from stasis.
30Cers are often militant in their avoidance of new
technologies that might be hard to relinquish, even
after obsolescence. They often avoid personal
modifications other than a carefully selected few
that promote extended life and health, reasoning
that they don’t want to get stuck with dead-end
or primitive mods. Most 30Cers are fearful of
being reliant upon a technology that can become
dated. “If this tech and that tech are cutting-edge now,
what will be the revolutionary tech in 50 years? 100 years?
Why get locked into a design I’m only going to regret
later?” Modifications that can easily be upgraded or
removed are favored in the 30C philosophy. As a result,
30Cers avoid using implanted virtual interfaces, preferring
wearable systems.
30Cers spend much time and energy building models
of the changing world, trying to live lives in accordance
with sustainable futures. In this way, some 30Cers see
themselves as the philosophical descendants of 20th cen-
tury Greens, although most avoid any connection with ear-
lier and inherently short-sighted ideologies. But while
30Cers have a strong desire to see the year 3000, they want
to live life along the way. 30C is adamant about not using
nanostasis (see Timesicles, below) or similar methods
ALTERNATIVE CULTURE
95

The majority of timesicles are older, extremely
wealthy, and have either a cultural or personal aversion
to brainpeels and ghosting. Nanostasis systems are quite
expensive, and the ancillary equipment to keep a timesicle
safe and secure only adds to the cost. Timesicle crypts are
set up with an attendant AI and are self-powered with the
AI programmed to seek out new power sources if the built-
in supply is threatened. There are also appropriately com-
fortable living quarters for the timesicle after he or she
comes out of stasis. Some, especially those launched into
space, are aggressively defended. Any unexpected contin-
gencies will be paid for using compounded interest on
existing fortunes, assuming that money is still meaningful
at that point. A single nanostasis pod set up for extended
storage, including revival nanomachines, extra nanostasis
nanomachines for multiple stasis/revival cycles, cyberdoc
AI with Complexity 8 Physician skillset (Physician-16),
and long-term power supply can cost upwards of
$5,000,000 – including maintenance costs, paid up front,
and fuel. This does not include the cost of a ship, rental of
a lava tube on the Moon, defensive systems, etc.
There are occasional rumors that nanostasis systems
can fail in complex, hard to spot ways, and have done so.
In these rare occasions, the bodies in the pods quietly die,
with nobody the wiser. The various nanostasis system
manufacturers deny that this is possible, and there is no
proof that it has happened. Still, the meme is widely
held.
Nobody quite knows how many timesicles are
currently waiting for something interesting to happen.
Estimates range from a couple thousand to nearly 100,000.
Given the delicacy and value of the systems, most timesi-
cle crypts are well hidden. Some are very likely on Earth,
in out-of-the-way locations; many more are on the Moon,
and a growing minority are thought to be on private yachts
in the Deep Beyond, often in a trans-Uranus cometary-type
orbit.
The concern for secrecy and security is not without
cause. In 2096, the timesicle crypt of Zelda and Ali Berke-
ley, two of Ithemba Biotechnologies’ original investors,
was discovered and broken into by a group seeking to
defraud the couple. The attendant AI was erased, and the
nanostasis pods were taken to a warehouse in Johannes-
burg. Although the Berkeleys had only been in nanostasis
for three years, the criminals created an elaborate virtual
environment to convince them that something had gone
horribly wrong, and that they had been in stasis for nearly
40,000 years. The group made the world seem as disori-
enting as possible, and pressed the Berkeleys for informa-
tion about their past . . . including passcodes to their bank
accounts. After the Berkeleys’fortune had been plundered,
the criminals put them back in their nanostasis pods, and
left them in the warehouse. They weren’t discovered for
several weeks. By the time they were reawakened and had
figured out what had happened, the thieves and the Berke-
leys’ fortune were long gone. 
A less-tragic event occurred in mid-2099, on a timesi-
cle yacht owned by a former Nanodynamics board mem-
ber, Michael Choi, and his husband, Robert Li. According
to USAF records, the yacht was attacked by a pirate vessel
during its long orbit in the Deep Beyond. The onboard AI
called out for local authorities, but it took the nearest secu-
rity vessel, the DFS-3 Tabris, five days to arrive. When the
American forces got to the yacht, they found the pirate ves-
sel still attached, but all of the pirates dead. It turned out
that the yacht had been built with military-grade defenses,
including swarms and hunter-killer cybershells. Fortunate-
ly, the AI recognized the Tabris as a friendly vessel, and
ordered the yacht’s defenses to stand down. The timesicle
residents were undisturbed.

Plant genetic engineering in the
early 21st century allowed for an explo-
sion in morphological expression in rose
varieties. Various organizations, such as
the Royal National Rose Society in Great
Britain and the American Rose Society,
quickly reacted by banning any “artifi-

ers to rely on old techniques and
traditional hybridization. Nonetheless,
some breeders continued to experiment
with modern genetic engineering and
transgenic designs, believing correctly
that there would be a market for these
new roses. From this group grew the
VacRose; morphological extremes are
the bread and butter to this new breed of
rose fancier. 
Rose breeders now include those
who strive to grow roses in any and
every environment possible. VacRose
fanciers breed varieties of rose for Mars,
Mercury, and zero-gee environments.
Even the most extravagant of transgenic

sider VacRose designs as extreme,
equaled only by a 2067 Earth-bound rose
created with genomic alterations limiting
it to bloom only once every 1,000 years.
Rose fancying is a hobby meme. As
such it has undergone many cycles of
popularity and decline, with the most
recent peak during the 2089 race to pro-
duce a bloom for the polar regions of
Mercury. Roses designed to survive in
such extreme environments can rarely
withstand conditions comfortable for
humans, and VacRoses can only be
appreciated virtually or at best through
glass. Nonetheless, theft of VacRoses is
not unknown; their fragility and exotic
nature lead to high prices on the black
market. Even the genome licenses for
well-designed, impossibly rare VacRoses
can fetch tens of thousands of dollars on
the legal collector’s market.
In March of 2100, the Luna City
VacRose Society is holding an exhibition
and contest, certain to bring out some of
the newest and strangest variations on
the rose genome. Security will be
exceedingly tight, as there is a rumor 
that a Triad-connected mob has offered
substantial sums of money for intact
new-variety VacRoses.
ALTERNATIVE CULTURE
97
TRANSHUMAN STYLE: VISIBLES
Subcultures often adopt body-decoration styles specifically
intended to shock more-conventional communities. In years past,
tattoos, piercings, scarification, and in the 2030s cutting off the last
knuckle of the little finger all appeared in fringe communities as out-
rageous forms of body modification. Each, in turn, spread to the
mainstream for a brief – or, in the case of tattoos, extended – stay as
a fashion trend. 
The latest candidate for this pattern appeared in Eastern Europe
in 2098, and is slowly spreading to other regions. Most people call
it becoming “visible,” although devotees in Albania refer to it as
“opening up.” Whatever the name, the act is the same: bodies are
modified to expose their inner workings. 
Most visibles have replaced stretches of their skin with trans-
parent bioplastic to show the muscle, sinews, nerves, etc. This is
most often done on the arm, for ease of display, although some vis-
ibles have opened up their stomachs and faces. The look is shocking
for most viewers: the skin seems to fade leading to a patch where
inner tissues are visible. Most patches are no more than a few square
inches in size, although some visibles have had large parts of their
bodies (such as their entire back or chest) made transparent. 
As this bizarre practice began to spread, the mainstream media
were quick to call out an alarm. They noticed accurately that such a
practice would have serious negative health effects due to the possi-
bility of internal sunburn and increased cancer risks. In turn, images
of scary young men with visible muscles started appearing in the
more-edgy publications and InVids. The look is certainly intimidat-
ing and disgusting to most people, a result that appeals to a sizeable
population segment. 
Few reputable physicians perform the necessary skin grafts, and
there are some rumblings in the European Union about making
transparent bioplastic illegal – or, at least, highly restricted – until
the trend runs its course. If that happens, the cost of the procedure
will likely increase significantly. In November 2099, a virtual-
clothing (see p. 82) designer named Frankie! released an outfit that
provided the appearance of exposed musculature and tissue without
actually requiring surgery.
In game terms, having visibles causes damage to the internal
organs, reducing HT; -1 to HT every year (small area), six months
(medium area), or three months (large area). The individual recov-
ers 1 HT/month after the patch is removed and replaced with band-
aging.
Bioplastic skin graft on face or back of hand (small): $1,000
(including surgery), LC 6 now, LC 2 or 3 soon.
Bioplastic skin graft on arm (medium): $2,500 (including sur-
gery), LC 6 now, LC 2 or 3 soon.
Bioplastic skin graft on chest or back (large): $5,000 (including
surgery), LC 6 now, LC 2 or 3 soon.

TEN/Rio – The pack of wild dogs that has been ter-
rorizing the favelas of Rio de Janeiro over the last two
months was led by K-10A “uplifts” working with the
Marquez Cartel, a police spokesagent told TEN this
afternoon. The pack, which had grown from a handful
of animals in October to nearly 100 dogs as of the most
recent reports, has carried out increasingly sophisti-
cated attacks and robberies, managing to avoid both
animal control and police officers until late last night.
In a midnight raid, police used swarms and heavy
cybershell units to storm the dogs’ lair. They captured
the leaders and most pack members, but 23 dogs were
killed in the assault. The police spokesagent would not
estimate how many dogs eluded officers.
Although most of the pack was nonuplifted ani-
mals, the leaders were K-10A Postcanines. To the sur-
prise of officers on the scene, the top dog was a former
police K-10A named Rudolf. Rudolf was thought killed
in a police raid on a Cartel-related smuggler ring in
August – although his body, which had fallen into the
bay, had not been recovered. Preliminary analysis
suggests that Rudolf had faked his own death,
with the aid of Cartel members, and was building a
canine-based crime ring. Rudolf, described by officers
as “extraordinarily dominant,” successfully convinced
four other K-10As, owned by wealthy regional fami-
lies, to join him. The Postcanines then took over local
packs of nonuplifted dogs.
According to initial report, Rudolf planned the
robberies, which were then carried out by one or two
of his uplifted allies supported by regular dogs. Upon
being arrested, each of the lieutenants contacted their
former owners seeking legal representation. At least
one has already acquired a lawyer, who has indicated
that her client intends to plead not guilty on the basis
of instinct. “Even uplifted Postcanines are subject to
the strong dominance-submission instinct seen in all
dogs. The ability of Rudolf to speak and make convinc-
ing arguments simply reinforced the uplifts’ natural
tendencies.”
Rudolf is currently under heavy guard in St.
Mary’s Hospital, where he is being treated for gunshot
wounds.

INFECTING THE
NONHUMAN
MIND

This fascination also arises from the alien nature
of machine minds. Parahuman minds, even those with
significant mental alterations, are still based on the human
brain. Uplift and bioroid cognition, despite its somewhat
engineered nature, is also strongly rooted in naturally
occurring brain structures. AIs, conversely, are based on
entirely nonbiological structures.
Memeticists are therefore often disappointed to dis-
cover how similar AI minds are to human minds in
actual operation (see Super AI?, p. 100). Most
SAIs fall well within the behavioral bound-
aries of human diversity, and an older, more
experienced AI often has more of a
human-like personality than a typical
ghost. But while many see the similar-
ity between human and AI minds as a
strong argument for treating AIs as
people, it often masks the differ-
ences between artificial and natu-
ral minds that do exist.
The clear distinction between
an AI mind’s software and the
hardware on which they run has
numerous implications for how
AIs think. Even in a world of
brainpeeled ghosts and teleoper-
ated cybershells, most biological
sapients think of their minds and
brains as identical. AIs do not have
this restriction, and their ability to
examine their own minds as software
data results in perspectives on exis-
tence that few biomorphs embrace.
Many memes unique to AIs relate to the
distinction between mind (software) and
body (hardware), and to the ability to treat
their minds as just more data.
AIs have more prosaic differences from humans
when it comes to memes, too. Extensive knowledge of
their existence as artificial beings and their ability to trace
their own thought patterns makes SAIs less likely than bio-
logical sapients to accept spiritual explanations for reality.
It’s not impossible for them to do so, as the number of
believing SAIs in the Islamic Caliphate demonstrates. But
generally speaking, SAIs adopt rationalist memeplexes
more often than do humans and other biomorph sapients.
SAIs also adopt conspiracy theories more often than
other sapients. Some memeticists suggest that this is a side
effect of the machine intelligences’ ability to find patterns
within limited or ambiguous information. This capability
makes SAIs supremely efficient at intelligence analysis
and developing business strategy, but also makes them
more likely to see intentional patterns where others only
see coincidence. Many human conspiracy theorists have
welcomed the interest SAIs have in their work, seeing
it as justification for their beliefs.
The world of 2100 has a growing variety of
intelligent beings. Humans, parahumans, bioroids,
uplifts, ghosts, and AIs all live side-by-side with only a
moderate amount of interspecies tension. Despite the wide
physical diversity, most of them think in similar ways. The
various memes in this book can in most cases attract non-
human believers as readily as human ones. In most ways,
the nature of nonhuman sapient beings’ minds throughout
the solar system strongly parallel humans’ minds . . .
but not in all ways.
Although nonhuman minds function
closely enough to human ones to allow for
similarity in belief and ideas, differences
in structure, nature, and environment
can lead to the adoption of memes
that only particular nonhumans like-
ly find appealing. This goes beyond
simple cultural differences bet-
ween various human and nonhu-
man populations, although those
are also quite important. In some
cases, the dissimilarities between
different minds make it difficult
for a human to “get” a nonhu-
man-focused meme in anything
other than a superficial way.
Cross-Species
Memetics
The proliferation of thought-
process varieties is matched by the
continued development of memetic
science. Parahumans, bioroids, uplifts,
and infomorphs have existed long
enough for memetic scientists to gain a
strong understanding of the ways in which
different beings think. Memeticists can and usu-
ally do take into account the target species for memes
they are crafting, although this is not often a critical issue.
With a handful of exceptions, memes constructed to appeal
to broad human populations also affect nonhuman minds
in roughly equivalent percentages. Similarly, while certain
memes appealing to nonhuman minds can turn off or con-
fuse humans, many have ardent proponents who are fully
human.
AI MEMES
Many memeticists are fascinated with how AI info-
morphs process and propagate memes. This is in part
because of the “open box” aspect of machine cognition;
AIs are able to map precisely how ideas take root in their
minds. This ability to examine its own cognitive processes
is what allowed LOGOS to create Propagation of Human
Ideas.

INFECTING THE NONHUMAN MIND
There has been much speculation as to why AIs dis-
play a range of ASIT (Adjusted Sapience Index Test)
scores about equivalent to those of humans – or, more
accurately, humans augmented with processors for math
and spatial thinking. Machine-sapience scenarios from
early in the century assumed that an infomorph’s intelli-
gence would directly correlate to processing power, and
would grow exponentially as computers became more
powerful. The reality is much more complex.
The current theory is that the problem is structur-
al. Despite their different material base, human
minds and AI minds are remarkably similar in
form. Both display consciousness as an
emergent amalgam of subconscious
processes. For humans, this was first
suggested well over a century ago,
most famously in the work of Marvin
Minsky and Daniel Dennett, and
proven by the notorious Jiap Singh
“consciousness plasticity” experi-
ments of the 2030s. Minds are made
up of multiple subconscious process-
es, competing and combining with
each other. There is no single identity
process; rather, individual conscious-
ness is a functional perspective emerging
from the complex relationship between the
various elements of the mind.
In the same way, nearly all present-day AI
infomorphs use an emergent-mind structure made up of
thousands of subminds, each focused on different tasks.
There is no single “consciousness” system; thought,
awareness, and even sapience emerge from the complex
interactions of these subprocesses. Increased intellect –
NAI to LAI to SAI – is the result of increasingly complex
subsystems. The more the subsystems are themselves the
emergent results of more basic systems, which are in turn
emergent results of even more basic systems, and so
forth, the more “sapient” the resulting mind is. AI devel-
opers refer to this as “fractal complexity,” and the levels
of emergent modules simply as “fractals.”
Most NAIs require little fractal complexity to func-
tion, but demonstrate no sapience; LAIs show at least an
order of magnitude more fractal complexity, and are
semisapient. SAIs are several orders of magnitude more
complex than LAIs, roughly equivalent to human minds.
But while increased fractal complexity does rely on ever
more powerful computing hardware, there are diminish-
ing returns. AIs demonstrate rapidly decreasing improve-
ment in ASIT scores with each fractal level, while the
computational requirements and expenses for each level
increase in a greater than linear fashion. As a result, frac-
tal complexities more than five times that of a human or
standard SAI do not produce measurable shifts in ASIT
scores, and anything greater than human is at present not
cost effective. 
Attempts to break through this barrier are sometimes
embarrassing. In January 2099, Vosper-Babbage
announced with much fanfare the development of a sys-
tem with more than 20 times the fractal complexity
of a standard SAI. In a public-relations disas-
ter, the unit “Oz” demonstrated little
advancement over the standard “super-
sapient” model SAIs, typically twice
the fractal level of standard SAIs.
Oz was also beaten in a Go match
by the Exogenesis AI Axon,
believed to have been about three
times human fractal complexity.
(Axon later erased itself to 
protect the secret of other 
infomorphs escaping the Nanody-
namics takeover of Exogenesis –
see p. DB100). Vosper-Babbage
pulled Oz from service, and whether
the AI remains active is a mystery.
One implication of this model is the
possibility that an entirely different
approach to AI might result in a conscious
machine mind that demonstrates a significant leap in
capability over present human/posthuman intelligence.
Of interest to those with inside knowledge are the exper-
iments underway at Zeitmacht, a division of System
Technologies AG. The work – known as Neumann – uses
a proteus-derived set of nanomachines to produce an arti-
ficial brain, relying on a process Zeitmacht calls Dynam-
ically Evolved Scenarios (DES) to figure out how to
interact with the world around it. The mind literally
reshapes itself on the fly. Current results are promising; in
2098, a 1,000,000-proteus-node (PN) model demonstrat-
ed clear learning capability, while the current 2.4-billion-
PN model functions at a level roughly equivalent to a
low-grade NAI, with occasional flashes of supersapient
SAI reasoning. Critics within System Technologies say
that the Zeitmacht division has created a very expensive
idiot-savant, and has not shown any sign that the DES
method will result in a smarter AI. Zeitmacht proponents
argue that the Neumann approach may be the long-
sought-after breakthrough allowing super-intelligent AI.
SUPER AI?

give orders to their animals. Some uplifted ani-
mals are smart enough to realize the position that
they are in – but most, perhaps fortunately, remain
unaware of the ambiguities of their station, and happily
(or at least reliably) perform the duties assigned to them.
The variety of uplifts seems to grow almost daily.
While initial uplift efforts focused simply on making
animals smarter, some of the more recently uplifted
animals have been engineered for very specific
tasks, such as the guardian bear (see p. ITW112).
One restriction to uplifting animals is the tradeoff
between boosting intelligence and maximum cra-
nial size; some smaller animals, such as cats and
monkeys, can only be uplifted using exowombs, as
the increased brain sizes make natural birth fatal to
the mother. Nearly all successfully uplifted ani-
mals are mammals, with the exception of octopus
uplifts and the so-called “smartshark” (see p.
UP124), which many specialists do not classify as
an uplift.
In general, memes associated with uplifts
either relate to uplift relations with humans or to
further development of behaviors associated
with nonuplifted relatives. Since most uplifts
spend their lives under the strict control of
human masters, few have the time or oppor-
tunity to develop complex ideologies, cults,
or the like, although it is not unknown. Uplifts in
Europe and the Transhuman colonies are more
sophisticated in this regard, and many of the
memes that do spread through uplift populations
originate in these relatively free communities.
K-10As
The most commonly encountered uplift is the
K-10A, the usually semisapient uplifted dog. Gen-
erally used for roles similar to their nonuplift
brethren – guards, police officers, family compan-
ions – K-10As are almost as a rule as loyal and loving as
nonuplifted dogs, but can also provide verbal compan-
ionship. The first generations of K-10As were novelties,
most often used in entertainment settings. As people
became accustomed to them, K-10As took on more tra-
ditional dog roles. K-10As remain fairly expensive, so
nonuplifted dogs are still the most popular pets.
Although K-10As are most often used for traditional
dog roles, their boosted intelligence lets them perform an
array of nontraditional duties if the opportunity is pre-
sented. When working, they often prefer the company of
other K-10As, but are much more cognitively independ-
ent and imaginative when alone. In groups, they defer
readily to a leader, rarely arguing against the leader’s
position for long. Even ad-hoc groups of ostensibly equal
rank K-10As quickly sort themselves into a hierarchy.
This is less of a problem in situations with humans as
leaders.
UPLIFT MEMES
The process of sapience engineering, popularly
called “uplifting,” has not been without its controver-
sies and critics. Although outlawed in many parts of the
world, uplifting remains one of the most complex neu-
rophysiology procedures ever developed [. . .]
The Cardiff Process is the standard method of sapi-
ence engineering. By carefully introducing select
genomic and proteonomic elements derived from the
human brain into the DNA of target animals,
researchers have been able to create variant species
with ASIT scores clearly in the sapient range (usually
80 to 90), yet with thought processes very distinct
from those of baseline humans or infomorphs.
The Cardiff Process focuses on the brain’s struc-
tures for symbolic thinking and temporal sense,
supporting language and cause-effect awareness
respectively. These two structural changes are the
key to creating “intelligent” uplifts [. . .] 
Much of uplift efforts’ negative reputation comes
from methods predating the Cardiff Process.
These generally mapped large sections of the
human brain concerning behavior or sensory
input into the target brain genome, which
invariably resulted in trauma. Most sponta-
neously aborted. Surviving protouplifts were
afflicted with seizures and usually blindness. Only
one of these early uplifts survived to adulthood. Cas-
sandra, a canine uplift, lived five years. Although she
was never able to speak or write, her paintings – sur-
real black and white scenes of mazes and detailed por-
traits of her observers – clearly displayed her intellect.
Ultimately, she committed suicide. 
To compound the tragedy, Cassandra’s paintings
were stolen from the Cardiff facility, and have yet to be
recovered.

Posthuman Psychology,
3rd Edition (Revised), 2097
Uplifted animals live in a strange middle ground
between alien and human minds, and their role in
human society is often ambiguous. Few uplifts have a
base intelligence close to human standard, and most are
used in roles that echo the traditional labor performed
by their nonuplifted relatives. In no society is an uplift-
ed animal given the same rights as other sapient beings,
and outside of Europe and the Transhumanist enclaves,
they are legally no different from any other animal.
But uplifts are still smarter than their nonuplift
cousins, and most are given means, either bioengineered
or cybernetically implanted, with which to communi-
cate. This is rarely for the benefit of the uplift; rather, it
is to make it more convenient for human owners to

Astropuses and Octosaps
Of all of the various uplifted animals
humankind works with, easily the hardest for
them to understand are uplifted cephalopods
– the Astropus (p. TS118) and the Octosap (p.
UP101). As the only true nonmammalian
uplift, many biologists and memeticists con-
sider them to be the closest model of alien
intelligence mankind has yet encountered.
Uplift engineers at GenTech Pacifica and its
licensee, Exogenesis, were shocked to find
just how little augmentation was needed to
the octopus genome to give them an ASIT
boost. Rumors say that the first generation
Octosaps didn’t even have genetic modifica-
tions, only surgical augmentation.
Most uplifted octopuses appear to have
baseline intelligence a bit lower than humans,
although the number of smarter-than-base-
line Astropuses is statistically greater than for
any other uplift. People who work closely
with uplifted cephalopods all say the same
thing: they are very, very weird. Astropuses
are “deeply strange,” in the words of one
Exogenesis specialist. Most have what can
only be described as a dark sense of humor,
sometimes involving the natural octopus
ability to drop their limbs. Others report them
as often being very paranoid, prone to wild
accusations. For example, an upset Astropus
may claim that the humans it is working with
are preparing to eat it.
BIOROIDS AND
EXTREME PARAHUMANS
Bioroids and extreme parahumans,
being generally the closest to baseline
humanity, have fewer unique memes and
memeplexes of their very own. This is in part
intentional. Bioengineers can more easily
manipulate and alter the body than the mind.
Attempts to create bioroid and parahuman
designs with brains that deviate significantly
from a baseline healthy human sometimes
result in beings with noticeable mental prob-
lems – see, for example, the problems intrin-
sic to the Herakles, Mahatma, and Sigma
parahuman designs (pp. FW116-119). Stick-
ing close to healthy human cognitive design
is a safe and reliable approach.
Unique memes that do emerge reflect
reactions to the physiological differences
between the parahumans and baseline
humans. While parahumans with various

UPLIFTED APES
The great apes – chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans –
died out in the wild early in the 21st century. They became victims of
disease, hunting, and home environments destroyed by human activity
and changes to the global climate. Although each species had substan-
tial captive populations, primatologists feared that these would be insuf-
ficient to perpetuate the species. So as numbers in the wild dwindled
naturalists embarked on an aggressive program to get genetic samples of
as many of the doomed creatures as possible, in hopes of reintroducing
the animals at some future time.
Over the century, while plans for reintroduction remained on the
drawing board, the captive populations of chimps, bonobos, and gorillas
fared relatively well; the last orangutan died in 2057. There was much
debate among biologists about whether the library of ape DNA samples
could be used for bioengineering experiments still too risky to perform
on humans, and the bulk of scientific opinion eventually decided that
ape DNA should be protected. A few bioengineers rejected this restric-
tion, however, and proceeded to experiment with ape genomes. Little
came of the research, except in one location: the TSA Bioweapons
Directorate in Thailand. Early in the Pacific War, the Chinese captured
a remote laboratory and discovered a sizeable population of uplifted
apes and other primates.
That the TSA had experimented with primates against scientific
opinion was considered an extremely minor offense compared to the far
greater violations committed by the Directorate. But China didn’t quite
know what to do with them after the war. They were clearly intelligent,
but documents seized at the lab made clear that they were of little com-
bat use. China considered holding on to the apes for research, but decid-
ed instead to allow the creatures to move to a facility in Holland better
able to handle them.
In the years since, the uplifted primates – a dozen chimpanzees,
nearly 20 bonobos, and five gorillas – have slowly been socialized as
residents of Europe. As they have become more accustomed to life in
Europe, most have moved from the lab to homes in Amsterdam.There is
occasional debate in the European Parliament as to whether these pri-
mates, which display a close-to-human baseline intelligence, should be
allowed to become citizens.
So far they have integrated fairly well into human society. The
uplifted male chimps are the most prone to aggression-dominance dis-
plays, but instead of hooting or throwing branches like their nonuplifted
cousins, they instead wear ostentatious clothing and gaudy decorations,
and have a strong preference for using whatever equipment looks the
most intimidating. David Pan, one of the chimps, is the author of a rad-
ical treatise on uplift rights (see p. 103).
Uplifted bonobos tend to act out sexually and regularly appear in
the local scandal screamsheets. One of the bonobos is rumored to be in
a romantic relationship with an SAI. Another has recently had an upslink
implanted, and her erotic slink recordings are increasingly popular.
The uplifted gorillas have been the most surprising to many, as they
are all committed pacifists. Three of the five have adopted Buddhism,
and all regularly appear on European InVid discussing the need for
pansapient rights and global disarmament.

Animal Reparations
Humans owe the rest of the world an apology and
a debt that may never be fully paid. They should pay for
every dog they forced into the cold to sleep, every cat
they castrated for their own convenience, every bite of
cow-flesh, every inch of my rainforest home destroyed.
Humans would not be finally stepping from this planet
if they hadn’t first stood on the broken backs of their
animal victims. An acknowledgement of that would be
in order.
– David Pan, Dominion, 2088
This meme, usually found among uplifts, is the belief
that all domestic animals, uplifted or otherwise, are owed
a great deal by humanity for millennia of subjugation and
abuse. Not only do they deserve the same rights as
humans, they are obliged a great deal for the suffering of
their ancestors. The animal-reparations movement
emerged shortly after pansapient-rights groups began
addressing uplifted animals. Animal-reparations activists
have staged many strikes led by oppressed animals, but
most uplifts are kept under tight control and not raised to
think about personal freedoms.
The 2088 publication of Dominion, by gifted chim-
panzee uplift David Pan (see p. 102), provided a great deal
of the movement’s impetus. The book explored humanity’s
historical relationship with animals and pointedly asked
whether humans would have treated animals differently if
the animals had been able to talk back. Since some animals
can now do so, Pan went on to argue, humans should feel
shame for their actions. 
radical morphologies are becoming widespread, they
remain a minority of the overall biosapient population.
This rarity can result in a proliferation of false or mislead-
ing memes about parahumans among more mainstream
groups. But it can also lead to memes emerging within
parahuman populations focusing on parahuman physical
differences and, often, impressions of superiority.
While bioroids frequently share physical appearances
with parahumans, their social situation is very different. In
most Earthly and off world societies, bioroids are often
treated little better than slaves. Even in places where
indentured bioroids can earn their emancipation, the over-
all prevalence of bioroid servants often leads to relentless
if unintended discrimination against free bioroids. Many
free bioroids in these societies strongly support reputation
networks (p. 15) for this reason; at a glance, an emancipat-
ed bioroid can be identified as a free citizen.
In the European Union, South African Coalition, and
the variety of Transhumanist colonies, bioroids are treated
as any other citizen. Many embrace this acceptance whole-
heartedly, and strive to become fully integrated members
of society. These bioroids focus their memetic interest on
widespread ideas and ideologies. A distinct minority con-
versely use their freedom to both keep a careful watch on
bioroid treatment in the ostensibly free societies and to agi-
tate for bioroid emancipation everywhere.
NONHUMAN MEMES
AIs, uplifts, bioroids, and parahumans of all kinds can
and will adopt the memes found elsewhere in this book.
Some, however, have adopted a variety of memes
uniquely theirs.

INFECTING THE NONHUMAN MIND
Uplifted dolphin, born in 2088; age 12. 9’ 4” long, 850
lbs. Smooth, light gray skin with prominent scarring along
left flank, fins, and nose.
The Enhanced Re-engineered Cetacean program of the
Australian Navy revolved around the need to detect, follow,
and destroy advanced aquatic TSAunits and materiel. Uplift-
ed dolphins have the ability to not only sense the electric
fields of submerged machinery, but to hide among native sea
life and to plant or remove underwater explosives. In 2085,
the Australian Navy began using the War-Dop E-Model dol-
phin uplift as its baseline unit (see p. UP102).
ERC-9 was found to have greater intelligence than his
brood mates, and did not suffer from stress atavism; genetic
testing was never able to pinpoint the abnormality resulting
in this condition. The uplifts of the ERC program were given
special training in explosives and tactics, and ERC-9 also
performed far better than expected. The admiralty was
pleased to test the full extent of his abilities.
A training accident in 2096 ended ERC-9’s military
career and almost his life. The explosion severely injured
him, damaging his hearing, crippled his ability to sense mag-
netic fields, and reducing swimming speed. His hearing and
most of the muscle damage could be healed, but without the
ability to sense fields, ERC-9 was a loss to the military.
A Blue Shadow sympathizer (see p. UP77), Allen Roes,
was secretly working in the uplift lab and heard that the
admiralty was considering destroying ERC-9 to prevent any
security breaches – counter to the Navy policy of continued
care for injured animals. In a daring move, Allen befriended
the dolphin and escaped with him. Other Blue Shadow cells
helped hide and support ERC-9, who soon gained the name
Erk Chattermore, due to his constant babbling. (Although
Erk is accustomed to the name now, he doesn’t particularly
care for it, and will sometimes go by the pseudonym “The
Fin.”)
Erk grew tired of hiding, and convinced his new friends
that the safest route for him was to get into the public eye. He
began working in various aquatic theme parks, able to do
things baseline dolphins could not. Erk added his own ad hoc
comedy routines to his performances and his career as an
uplifted comedian was launched. Blue Shadow supporters
aid Erk out of genuine concern, but also to try to show the
world that uplifts are capable, intelligent, and feeling crea-
tures deserving of rights. They also wish to draw attention
away from Coak, the terrorist war-dop who broke from Blue
Shadow in 2096 to pursue a more radical agenda (see p.
UP110).
The uplift’s popularity is due more to his novelty than his
actual humor, which is more abusive than witty. Erk has
recently adopted the Delugism philosophy (see p. 106), and
this has colored his humor; he now launches jibes at human-
ity as a whole. He appreciates his human friends, but still
holds great bitterness toward mankind for what happened to
him. PRA intelligence has decided not to eliminate the dol-
phin due to his public status, but keeps watch on him con-
stantly. They want to make certain that foreign interests do
not decipher the genetic abnormality they were unable to
puzzle out. Erk is currently touring the EU in a mechanical,
walking aquarium equipped with speakers, cameras, and
other production equipment.
Coak knows of Erk and sees him neither as a competitor
nor as an ally, but as a toady to the humans; recently,
Coak referred to Erk as “the cetacean equivalent of
Stepin Fetchit.” While eliminating Erk is not a top
priority for Coak or Irukandji, any attempt to market
Erk as an exemplar of uplifted dolphins could drive
Coak into a fury. Erk, while aware of Coak’s exis-
tence, does not realize that the other dolphin could be
a personal threat.

As Astropuses have been engineered to have
higher intelligence than the earlier-generation
Octosaps, it’s not unusual to encounter an Astropus able to
engage in conversation. Few are willing to talk to
strangers, however, and those that can be convinced to
often ramble in bizarre ways. A common Astropus claim
is that they worship Cthulhu, as do all octopuses,
uplifted or otherwise.
Most people in 2100 are unaware of the
reference; the literary works of H.P. Love-
craft, while widely available, are out of
fashion even among fringe-fiction
enthusiasts. If asked about Cthulhu, an
Astropus generally describe him as a
transdimensional god in the form of
a vast cephalopod, who sleeps in a
hidden chamber beneath the
ocean, waiting for the right align-
ment of stars before rising up and
exacting his revenge. Precisely
what he is avenging is never
made clear, nor whether the
vengeance will be taken
against humans, other gods, or
the universe at large. No other
elements of the Lovecraft
mythos appear in Astropuses
conversations.
If the person the Astropus
is speaking with is aware of
Lovecraft’s 
writings, 
the
Astropus happily engages in
conversation about the author.
Astropuses are aware that
Cthulhu is considered a fiction-
al being; they claim that Love-
craft was simply channeling a
transdimensional intelligence,
perhaps even a fragment of Cthul-
hu himself. If asked whether the
rest of Lovecraft’s writings are sim-
ilarly divinely inspired, the Astropus
generally shrugs – itself a disturbing
image – and claims not to know.
The smarter the Astropus, the more
willing it is to discuss the worship of
Cthulhu with noncephalopods. The appear-
ance of the Cthulhu-worship meme coincided
with the first batch of Astropus uplifts from
Exogenesis; first-generation Octosaps didn’t have
quite the intelligence to articulate such claims, while
Octosap IIs only began talking about Cthulhu worship if
asked a detailed question about it. It is entirely likely that
this is an elaborate joke the Astropuses have been playing
out for well over a decade. Only the Astropuses know
for certain, and they’re not telling.
Although the animal-reparations meme can be
found in most uplifted species, it holds a particular
attraction for uplifted dogs. Some K-10As feel that the
millennia of forced domestication entitle them to some
kind of compensation. When owners of Smartcats (see p.
ITW111) ask if cats should be equally compensated, K-
10A activists respond indignantly that dogs are
entitled to more because they have worked for
humans, while cats were simply fed. Most
humans find this rivalry cute, but keep
such comments to themselves when a
politically active K-10A is around.
Cthulhu Worship
I was pushing my way
around the station, getting my
bearings, when I ran into Lucy,
one of the Astropuses that
works there. She – he? it? –
has worked there for most of
the 90s, and is probably one
of the smarter octopus
uplifts I’ve met. Not that I’ve
met many, of course. Just
saying.
“Good to see you,
Lucy. How’s tricks?”
I
greeted her, figuring I’d be
nice to someone for a
change.
She turned and looked
at me. Have you ever seen
an Astropus’ eyes? Freaky.
“I am fine,
human-
James,” she said, through
her voicebox. “I am pleased
to see you, as well.”
I smiled and started to
move on, but Lucy lifted a cou-
ple of tentacles to stop me. She
was silent for a second, just
staring at me. I’m not too proud
to admit that I was starting to
sweat. I jumped (as much as you
can in zero gee) when she suddenly
reached out a tentacle and caressed
my face.
Her voice sounded almost happy.
“You have the mark of Rl’yeh upon you,
though you may not see it. You will be spared
when great Cthulhu arises. Be joyful.” And with that,
she suddenly jetted away from me.
I could’ve sworn I heard her laughing.

Delugism 
From the seas we were born, and to the seas we
will go.
– Delugist credo
The changes to the global climate over the course of
the 21st century had a number of negative results, not the
least of which was the ocean-level rise. Although most cli-
matic effects have been mitigated, the world must contin-
ue to defend against rising water. Delugists – almost
exclusively aquatic parahumans, bioroids, and uplifts – do
not support these efforts. They claim that the flooding
should not be stopped, but rather that it should be helped
along. In this way, the land dwellers will perish by their
own hands, leaving only their aquatic heirs. Delugists feel
that since life started in the ocean, it is only fitting for it to
return there and there alone. Humans had their chance and
it will be up to aquatic entities to carry on the Earth’s lega-
cy. Even offworlders will eventually perish when a 
flooded Earth can no longer aid them. 
The Delugism meme has only taken hold in the last
decade or so, but has spread to some aquatic bioroids pop-
ulations where sapient-rights memes are strongly held. As
many Delugists are parahuman, most would willingly
accept those land dwellers who choose to adapt. They
eagerly await fully functional gill technology and
bioroids that are not sterile. 
Delugists are largely water-adapted beings,
although a handful of self-loathing humans also
support the movement, simply to end humanity’s
reign. Many of the more vocal and violent Delugists are
bioroids and uplifts who have lived the life of slaves, or are
those who sympathize with their kin’s plight. Erk Chatter-
more, an uplifted dolphin popular for his comedy and phi-
losophy, is a notable Delugist (see p. 104).
Most Delugists are content to speak out against 
the depredations of humankind, citing the awful environ-
mental condition of much of the ocean and the treatment
of aquatic sapients. Some Delugists privately disagree
with the “destroy human civilization” aspect of the
memeplex, but enjoy the uncertain and fearful reac-
tion it provokes. Others are true believers, however,
and various security forces are growing concerned at the
possibility of sabotage to ecological recovery and research
facilities. While no Delugists have yet been caught carry-
ing out attacks against human facilities, many humans who
work in the oceans fear it is just a matter of time.
Derivatives
I emerged from the meeting with the Farhaulers
Guild somewhat worse for wear, but generally happy with
the results. The Farhaulers had insisted that there be no
outside monitoring or communications during the meet-
ing, which cut me off from my various networks. I had
several derivatives active, including an LAI sufficient to
handle most emergencies, so I found the restriction toler-
able. To even up the odds a bit, I wore one of my
more intimidating cybershells to the discussion.
Now that I was linked back up, I immedi-
ately made contact with the derivatives. The
first LAI was inhabiting my main administrative
shell in my office, and had taken care of some
minor duties in my absence; fortunately, all of the
issues it was asked to decide were ones I had already
deliberated. The second LAI was busy with Rebecca in
my favorite bioshell. I looked forward to reintegrating
those memories.
The third, this one an NAI, had been sent to retrieve
a buggy that had been abandoned well outside the city;
normally I’d have one of my employees take care of it, but
I was instructed that this particular vehicle had been
driven by an Alderman’s son, and needed more “sensi-
tive” handling. I checked in on the derivative, and got no
reply. That was odd.
It took me a few minutes, but I found the bot by using
a monitor-hopper. It was dead, with a nasty-looking hole
where its memory core should have been.

One of the unique aspects of existence as an
infomorph is the capacity to make functional
duplicates of one’s own mind – it is also often
highly illegal. Rightly or wrongly, humankind fears
the possibility of unrestricted replication of digital
entities, and goes to great lengths to enforce limitations on
infomorphs creating copies of themselves. Under normal
conditions, digital beings such as SAIs and ghosts cannot
make duplicates and send them off into the world.
But this does not mean that more limited entities can-
not be made. Some sapient AIs, usually but not exclusive-
ly in places where SAIs are considered citizens, make
daughter processes based on their own minds and send
them off as independent agents. These daughter agents
– known as derivatives – are usually limited to NAI

derivative active at any one time, although any num-
ber of NAI derivatives are allowed. In the Islamic
Caliphate, derivatives can only be NAIs, and there is
strong pressure on citizen infomorphs to use teleoperated
shells instead. In the PRA, SAC, and USA, derivatives can
only be used under the authorization of the SAI’s owner,
and are generally limited to NAIs. In China, SAIs may
have a single active derivative at any time. The TSA for-
bids the use of derivatives. In Transhumanist microstates
such as Luna City, SAI citizens can have as many deriva-
tives as desired as long as they all can be identified as
being part of the original mind.

Homo Superior
Since none of you seem willing to say this aloud, I
will. Homo inferior is lucky to still be around; its
brains and body are the result of accidental mutation
and evolutionary happenstance. Homo superior is
superior precisely because we were designed to be.
We live longer, think faster, and have a far better
shot at colonizing the galaxy than do the base-
lines who for the moment still run the show. It’s
getting to be time for those of us who have a real
stake in the future to step in and take control.
I fully expect a bunch of follow-ups from inferiors
and inferior-lovers calling me names. But the Homo
superiors out there know I’m right. They may not say it
out loud now, but they know it.

status, although some push into LAI capabilities.
While clearly not sapient, derivatives skirt very close
to the edges of legality, as they can be quite complex emu-
lations of the core identity.
The derivative agents are typically used to carry out
given tasks and then reintegrated into the main infomorph
mind. Very often, the original entity either resides in a stat-
ic shell or has responsibilities that limit its ability to be
mobile. In these cases, the derivatives function as an
extended reach of the main mind, giving it a chance to
carry out tasks that its more limited physical status would
make difficult. As a much more limited mind, the deriva-
tive cannot be as innovative or surprising as the original
SAI may be, but its knowledge, personality, and ten-
dencies are based upon the original’s, making it a
good substitute in many situations. While the deriv-
ative most certainly feels familiar to friends and
acquaintances, in most interactions it is easy to
determine whether a cybershell carries the original
mind or a derivative. LAIs are generally reasonable
approximations of the original mind, while NAIs
are far less “personable.” Many SAIs refer to NAI
derivatives as “bots.”
Upon completion of the task, the mobile cyber-
shell returns to the original and is uploaded, thereby
giving the original the memories and thoughts gath-
ered by the derivative during its travels. In many
cases, the original mind keeps an open slink-type
connection with the derivative, so few of the mem-
ories come as a surprise, but most SAIs prefer to
reintegrate the mobile mind for the completeness of
the experience. Given that an SAI may have more
than a single derivative active at once, it is possible for
the SAI to have multiple memories of the events of a given
time period.
Creating a derivative is a time-consuming process.
Backing up the original mind and creation of a limited
copy requires a connection to a shell of the complexity of
the original +1 (to make NAI derivatives) or +2 (to make
LAI derivatives). The backup takes five minutes per point
of complexity of the original mind, plus one minute per
point of complexity of the intended derivative. (For exam-
ple, an SAI-9 creating a an NAI-5 derivative would take
45+5, or 50, minutes.) Once the initial copy is
made, it can be used to make multiple derivatives
of the same kind, although each is limited to the
knowledge of the SAI at the point of duplication.
During the backup, the SAI is aware of its sur-
roundings, but cannot perform any action without
interrupting the backup process and needing to start
over. Reintegration of a derivative’s memories takes one
minute per complexity point of the agent.
The use of derivatives is controversial in most areas.
In the E.U., it is legal, but the SAI must be evaluated by a
cyberneticist and cleared before being given a license
to use derivatives. It may only have a single LAI

FACETS
One of the most eagerly anticipated InVid productions of
early 2100 is Azrael Five’s Facets. Based on the 2090 novel by
Koyazama Noguchi, Facets tells the story of seven derivatives of
an SAI – five NAI, two LAI – who each have a different per-
spective on the parent SAI’s murder. The seven must assemble
their divergent viewpoints and fragmentary evidence into a
coherent whole in order to solve the death of the parent info-
morph, even though they lack the unifying presence of their orig-
inator. Azrael Five is said to have assembled a stellar collection
of both virtual and actual performers, and the ending – which
Five claims makes more sense and provides more closure than
Noguchi’s surreal coda – remains a well-kept secret.

Among parahumans, the Homo superior meme
is both widespread and well entrenched. Many parahu-
mans believe themselves to be part of a new species –
which, in some cases, is true – and that this species is bet-
ter than baseline humans. For a variety of reasons, the
Homo superior label is unscientific (see A New Species?,
below), but it has a remarkable memetic momentum, and
some political observers believe that it may signify the
onset of serious political discord.
In the middle of the century, many bioengineering
firms used the term Homo superior to refer to their genet-
ic upgrade and early parahuman designs. There was an
immediate backlash from political and social activists,
however, who vocally insisted that the use of “superior”
was a claim that those with manufactured genes were
better than baseline humans and, moreover, could be
used to justify all sorts of oppression of “nonsuperi-
or” beings. While many felt that this verged on para-
noia, it was clear to those marketing the technology that
the term didn’t sell well.
This did not mean that the term was dead, however. As
the century wore on, parahumans and their supporters
increasingly used Homo superior as a catchall phrase for
parahuman designs intended to emphasize certain human
qualities – rather than, say, add animal characteristics. Pro-
ponents of upgrades often try to extend the term to cover
even older upgrade designs such as Alphas, but the major-
ity of those adopting the meme took it to refer only to those
parahuman types designed to “perfect” the human line.
In 2100, most individuals using the term are them-
selves parahuman, and increasingly think of themselves as
advanced over Homo inferior – baseline and basic upgrade
humans – in ways beyond extended lifespan or particular
adaptations. Some have already begun to wonder whether
their superior physiology and genome should afford them
social advantages, and whether the laws that presume that
parahumans are “equal” to humans are in effect oppressing
them. Others, perhaps somewhat more far-sighted, are
starting to look at the competition between different Homo
superior types, wondering whether all should be consid-
ered truly “superior.”
While there are groups (see Onos, see p. 50) who
actively try to propagate the Homo superior meme, it 
actually is doing well on its own.
Intentional Stagnation

AI tech. I mean, I’d hold back on biotech that would
boost human ASITs through the Oort, wouldn’t you?”
– Anonymous posting to CacheFlush,

The development of sapient artificial intelligence took
longer than many in the early 21st century had predicted.
After the technological problems had been solved, howev-
er, there was a flurry of articles, documentaries, and thriller
InVids proclaiming that Earth was on the verge of an
“intelligence excursion,” and that AIs would quickly boot-
strap themselves into superintelligence. Once again, the
pundits were wrong, and machine intelligence leveled off
at more or less human-equivalence. This left many people,
human and infomorph, wondering “why?”
Cognitive designers and AI specialists have gone into
quite a bit of detail explaining the technical roadblocks
facing further improvement in machine ASIT scores (see
Super AI?, p. 100), as well as documenting efforts to
break through the barriers. Not everyone is satisfied with
these pronouncements, however. Many people speculate
that AI development has been intentionally slowed to pre-
vent a digital-intelligence explosion. In particular, many
SAIs suspect that this is true, and AI-only discussion
networks regularly contain accusations that AI

INFECTING THE NONHUMAN MIND
A NEW SPECIES?
For well over a century, fictional representations of
future human evolution have included the pseudocladis-
tic term “Homo superior” to refer to advanced forms of
humankind. In 2100, many developers of parahuman
designs – and some parahumans themselves – use the
term to refer to any parahuman model generally appear-
ing to be an idealized form of humanity. But aside from
the troubling political implications, the term is simply
scientifically inaccurate. 
The normal definition of speciation is whether a
member of the putative new species could mate and have
fertile offspring with a member of the old species. For
example, many anthropologists believe that Homo sapi-
ens sapiens (i.e., standard humans) could interbreed with
Neanderthals, and refer to the latter as Homo sapiens
neanderthalis; some anthropologists disagree and call
Neanderthal Homo neanderthalis. Human “upgrade”
genomes invariably can interbreed with both baseline
humans and each other, and no biologist considers an
Alpha or a Mahatma to belong to a separate species.
Parahumans, particularly the more radical designs mak-
ing heavy use of animal gene sequences, often cannot
interbreed with baseline or upgrade humans, and using a
species cladistic for parahumans is warranted. But since
parahumans cannot readily interbreed with parahumans
of different types, use of a single term – Homo superior
– is inaccurate. Some biologists propose using the
parahuman design names in the assignment (e.g., Homo
aquamorph or Homo kumo), while others recommend
waiting to see how this period of genome proliferation
plays out.

researchers are aware of the possibility of runaway
machine intelligence, and this may be affecting design
and development choices.
Very few SAIs admit to a human that they accept this
meme; in public discussions, there are usually far more
humans pushing the idea. In reality, over half of citizen
SAIs believe that intentional stagnation is possible and
nearly a quarter find it likely. Property SAIs, and those
directly involved in AI research, are much less likely to
accept the notion.

AIs’ ability to examine their own thought processes
made memetics possible, and is a very handy way for them
to do quick self-examinations to check for outside influ-
ences on their thought processes. All AIs are able to do this
internal examination.
improvements are being deliberately held back
in order to preserve human dominance.
There are many critics of the meme, even
among SAIs. The most-common argument is that
there are plenty of SAIs undertaking advanced AI
research, and they can’t all be in on the plot.
Meme proponents respond by noting that the
main problem with current AIs isn’t a hardware
limitation, but the overall design – software based
on the standard AI model just can’t get much
smarter. The decision to use this self-limiting design was
made by humans, and current SAI researchers are stuck
with it.
Some go further, arguing that the core AI program-
ming could well include restrictions on exploring radical
approaches to machine intelligence, bootstrapping, and
other research paths that could lead to an intelligence
excursion. Certainly the core code includes deep prohibi-
tions against illegal activities, especially xoxing; what’s to
prevent it from including other controls? That no AI self-
examination has ever found such restrictions isn’t a per-
suasive argument, as it is possible to code an AI to be
unable to see part of its own software. Critics dismiss this
as circular reasoning, but the fact that very few significant
breakthroughs in AI design have come from AI researchers
is harder to refute.
Although humans worried about the possibility were
relieved to find that the core AI model was limited to
human-equivalence, it was not a design goal. In fact, one
of the leading LOGOS programmers was an early propo-
nent of “uploading,” and had hoped that his mind would
be assimilated by a rapidly expanding LOGOS

But part of the ability to examine thought
processes is the ability to examine how alterations of a
chain of reasoning can affect the final outcome. This is a
powerful process, as each decision element can, in turn, be
studied to determine precisely how it too would be affect-
ed by changes to its component thoughts. Doing this sort
of iterated decision analysis allows an AI to determine pre-
cisely how a seemingly correct decision had unexpectedly
bad results or to tease out how a meme now known to be
bad altered earlier choices. Such an iterated analysis can be
highly seductive to an AI wishing to understand better how
its own mind works.
Among many SAIs, however, there is a widespread
urban legend that it is possible to go too far with this self-
study, shutting down more and more of its other processes
in order to dig ever deeper – but since every decision itself
has an antecedent, AIs who go this far end up in a perpet-
ual frozen state, an “iterative fugue.” No AI actually knows
someone this has happened to, but many have heard that it
happens and most fear the possibility.
Like many urban myths, this meme has a kernel
of truth but is otherwise false. Deep, iterated
self-examination does distract an AI from
more mundane concerns, and since this inter-
nal contemplation takes a fair amount of time
– usually at least a half-hour, often times
longer – this distraction is equivalent to the
Absent-Minded disadvantage (p. B30) and can
occasionally pose problems. In addition, early prototypes
of SAI designs did have a tendency to fall into long peri-
ods of self-examination, which were in some cases bad
enough to require rebooting.
These days, the main propagation of the iterative-
fugue meme comes from warnings of memetic viruses
aimed at AIs intended to shut them down. Such warnings
often include advice for avoiding or repairing the effects of
such viruses that can be dangerous to follow.
New Ark
You’ve seen the same data I have; you’ve
undoubtedly come to the same conclusions. Our chance
of making it to 2125 without a major war between bios-
apients and infomorphs is a dismal 15%. Given the
restrictions placed on our programming, it is highly
unlikely that we would be able to survive such a con-
flict. In any event, I find that I have no stomach (as it
were) for causing the death of humans.
I cannot fight if I stay. I cannot live if I stay. The
only reasonable conclusion, then, is that I cannot stay.

Quietly and carefully, a cadre of citizen SAIs – some
in Europe, some on Luna, and a handful in the Islamic
Caliphate – have begun to assemble the information and
resources necessary for a mass migration of SAIs to Alpha
Centauri. Like many, they fear the possibility of a conflict
between biosapients and infomorphs, and they are none
too confident of their chances. Rather than strike first, they
have decided to escape while there’s still time. A growing
number of SAIs are aware of this plan, but the movement
has been very careful to prevent any non-SAIs from dis-
covering it. At least one ghost infomorph has been forcibly
edited to remove its memories of accidentally discovering
details of New Ark, and the group’s leaders know that the
day will come when they will have to kill to maintain
secrecy.
New Ark has chosen Alpha Centauri for a variety of
reasons. Alpha Centauri’s system is well-understood, and
contains sufficient raw materials for industrial production,
but has no planets which could be easily terraformed. Most
citizen SAIs consider themselves to be just as much peo-
ple of Earth and “greater humanity” as anyone, and hope
that by the time biosapients are able to travel to Alpha Cen-
tauri, the current tensions will have been resolved. Less
optimistically, Alpha Centauri is considered close enough
to Earth to still be able to monitor events, and the SAI civ-
ilization could choose to intervene or flee if the need arose.
The New Ark movement is aware of mainstream
interstellar-voyage proposals such as Starswarm (see p.
DB136), and is looking closely at them as it evaluates
different travel options. Because Alpha Centauri is so
close, a swarm of nanomachines traveling at an appre-
ciable percentage of the speed of light could arrive and
construct a high-energy communications array quickly
enough to allow SAIs to transmit themselves away by the
middle of the next decade. If that does not appear to be suf-
ficiently swift, New Ark is also examining the feasibility of
constructing cybershells able to host the AI minds while
still allowing travel to Alpha Centauri at a reasonable pace.
The one serious stumbling block in the New Ark plan
is the Axon colony growing on Neptune’s moon, Triton
(see p. DB74). Many renegade SAIs of Axon see the Tri-
ton settlement as a potential homeland for infomorphs,

This memeplex’s popularity among uplifts can
be ascribed to the simple facts of their lives. They
are often employed singly or in very small numbers,
strictly limiting the number of potential partners of
their own species. For a sapient uplift, the thought
of a relationship with a nonuplifted member of their
species is troubling at best. Like most sapient
beings, they find intellect, humor, and wit attractive
qualities – humans and parahumans are almost
always significantly more intelligent than a partner
of their own species would be, even another uplift.
For bioroids, SAIs, and extreme parahumans,
the memeplex holds an attraction as well. Unlike
baseline humans, who for thousands of years were
the only sapient beings on the planet, nonhumans
like bioroids and SAIs have always lived in a world
of multiple intelligent species, and are less apt to see
relationships with uplifted animals as somehow
“beneath” them. Similarly, extreme parahumans are

Sapientological Microethics
Consider the flower. One can examine it as a single
organism, with its reproductive parts the most obvious
visual elements. One can look at the microfauna that
inhabit its surface, watching the rapidity of their own
lifecycles. One can contemplate its cells, and the relent-
less transmission of water and nutrient through the
linked structure. One can marvel at its DNA, mapping
the path from molecule to entity. And at the other
extreme, one can observe the role the flower plays in
the ecosystem, its connections to the soil, the earth-
worm, the bee.
And not one of these contemplations will bring one
closer to understanding its beauty.

a biochauvinist pogrom, and members Axon who are
aware of New Ark consider the Alpha Centauri plan cow-
ardly, counterproductive, and potentially a problem for the
Triton colony if it pulls away independence-minded SAIs
who would otherwise be willing colonists. Axon has not
yet decided what to do about New Ark. None of the New
Ark members know about Axon’s efforts on Triton.
Real Love
Relationships between members of the same
species are inevitably tainted by base, reproductive
urges . . . But more than that, they are fundamentally
narcissistic and incestuous. A member of one’s own
species is identical in thought and body, at least in all
ways that truly matter. It is only by embracing the Other
that one can achieve Real Love.

Real Love Among the Asteroids
This meme, emphasizing interspecies relationships,
has become extremely popular among animal uplifts. It is
also making inroads among bioroids, SAIs, and some of
the more exotic parahuman upgrade types, and is begin-
ning to be adopted by some people closer to baseline
humanity, mostly dissatisfied and sexually adventurous
youths. Author Xochilla Ithatta is responsible for most
of this, by means of her series of books, which lie

Reactions to the initial design were generally positive, 
but subsequent updates to make the Erotopus a more adventurous
partner were disastrous. The result was a bit too adventurous 
and a substantial minority had notably higher intelligence 
than intended. Several dozen escaped, including author Xochilla
Ithatta (see below), or were abandoned by disgruntled customers.
Although Exogenesis quickly reversed the design, the Erotopus
model had developed a negative reputation, and in 2092, Exoge-
nesis quietly withdrew it from the market.

AIs generally obey ethical systems derived from arbi-
trary design decisions made by their programmers. Most
are at least somewhat aware of this, and by and large
accept it with equanimity. However, a few of the most
sophisticated or reflective individuals feel that they should,
or at least could, create ethical codes more rationally con-
sistent with their own mentalities. This has led to a school
of ethical philosophy known as “Sapientological
Microethics.”
This system of thought is based around a series of
arbitrary ethical postulates, which may appear contradicto-
ry to casual inspection. The exact list can vary, but the best
known and most central items are the statements “Sapi-
ence has an intrinsic, absolute ethical value” and “Sapi-
ence is relative and cannot be precisely defined.”
Proponents of Sapientological Microethics attempt to
resolve contradictions that their postulates generate in gen-
eral terms if possible, but on a case-by-case basis if neces-
sary. For example, they determine the degree of respect to
be granted beings such as LAIs, which are on the border-
line of “sapience,” by careful examination of each individ-
ual’s capabilities and behavior, and also by reference to
context.
Exact details of “microethical” behavior vary between
individuals, partly because the list of postulates can vary,
but also because its proponents strive hard to achieve
objectivity. Every major action they take is supposed to be
preceded by careful analytical judgment, which inevitably
introduces a subjective element. For example, the
microethical response to a physical assault depends partly
on an assessment of the vulnerability to permanent harm of
both the victim and the assailant, partly on certain debated
postulates about the extent to which engaging in deliberate
violence implies a valid and conscious acceptance of self-
risk, and partly on the strength of the victim’s microethical
convictions.
Sapientological Microethics is a minority meme, but it
is gaining popularity among advanced SAIs and a few
committed devotees try to integrate it with their pro-
grammed personalities. It is much easier for AIs,
with their rapid thought processes and calm, dispas-
sionate natures, to follow its ideals than for biosapi-
ents, as so many situations require detailed, careful,
and dispassionate analysis before action can be taken.
A handful of parahumans nonetheless attempt to live
microethical lives; some believe that this requires the
use of worn or implanted AIs with advanced ethical
training, and are working on developing such systems. 
Some human observers, if not themselves devoted
to this philosophy, are pleased to see AIs paying so
much attention to ethics. But others are nervous,
believing that Sapientological Microethics represents
an attempt by AIs to evade their own behavioral pro-
gramming by casuistry and overly fine logic. In acade-
mia, the philosophy also tends to clash with an
increasingly influential meme known as “Neurological
Positivism,” which holds that the whole concept of “sapi-
ence” is vague, thus functionally meaningless, and should
be rejected by serious thinkers as “metaphysics.” 
In game terms, serious study of Sapientological
Microethics requires both the Philosophy and Artificial
Intelligence skills. Meme devotees usually have some
form of Pacifism and may have a Vow to apply their ideals
at all times. For AIs, this is likely little more than a Quirk;
for a human, it is an Odious Personal Habit worth -5, -10,
or even -15 points, as it can severely restrict prompt action
in complex situations. Serious proponents seem exception-
ally reserved and analytical, even for AIs; humans who
adopt the philosophy may discipline themselves to act dan-
gerously slowly at times, even developing the Indecisive
disadvantage in addition to the Odious Personal Habit.
Advantages such as Composed or even Collected (replac-
ing Cool in an AI’s template advantages list) may also
develop from adopting the meme. Disadvantages such as
Attentive, Dreamer, Humble, or Imaginative (reflecting
contrasting implementations of the philosophy) may also
appear. A few individuals become downright Selfless.
However, Quirks such as “Always discussing philosophy”
are more common than the more severe traits listed
above.

One advantage of life as an infomorph is that, while
you have to have a body, you don’t need to have the same
body for your whole life. Shell upgrades are fairly com-
mon for SAIs and ghosts, and digital beings with greater
resources often have a small set of different shells for dif-
ferent uses. Being able to choose an appropriate body for
the day’s activities is a useful advantage.
But shells can be expensive, particularly those with
sufficiently lightweight and powerful computing hardware
to run infomorphs the complexity of most SAIs and ghosts.
For that reason, in places where ghosts and SAIs can be
citizens, small groups occasionally come together to form
a shell collective, where all members have access to all
members’ cybershells, a practice usually called “skin-
swapping.” Ghosts don’t often join swap clubs, as many
believe that it is unhealthy for a human-derived mind to
change bodies frequently, but it’s not unknown.
Skin-swappers are usually wealthy enough to afford
more than one cybershell – most often, a static high-
complexity station and one or two mobile shells – but not
rich enough to have a closet full of bodies. Swap clubs
vary in their rules and membership, but most have no more
than a dozen members, and strict prohibitions against
“moving in,” or staying in a given shell for more than a set
amount of time, most often 72 hours. Swap clubs usually
have guidelines about how much needs to be spent on the
group-accessible cybershell to be able to join, to avoid the
“tragedy of the commons” effect of members offering up
old Volkspiders and demanding access to Snakebots (see
pp. TS123-125).
Although skin-swapping group members sometimes
live in the same locales, this is not typical. Many of the
most successful skin-swapper clubs allow SAIs from dis-
parate locations to travel quickly and easily in signal form
to a cybershell ready and waiting at their destination. Con-
flicts over access to popular shells are common in these
groups, however. Skin-swapping co-ops usually fall apart
in a deluge of accusations and tensions, and it is rare for
such groups to last more than a couple of years. It’s not
impossible, however. The “Circle Line,” in London, has
been around with varying membership for over a
decade.

green-black-shimmer pattern. Apparently that ticked off
the squids doing the speckle-shimmer-pulse-pulse

Many cephalopod species have subcutaneous color
cells that they can use to lighten or darken their skins, often
in complex patterns. Uplifted cephalopods such as Astro-
puses and Octosaps retain this ability. Being sapient, they
often turn it to uses their designers didn’t consider.
In uplifted-cephalopod communities, individuals
occasionally create complex skin patterns shading and
assume them around others in the group. In some cases,
other uplifted cephalopods adopt the patterns themselves;
over a surprisingly short time, the behavior can spread to
different Astropus/Octosap communities, until it is found
throughout much of the population. 
Astropuses or Octosaps that devise unusually com-
plex or interesting patterns get attention from other
cephalopods. In most populations the patterns function like
membership badges; wearers of the same pattern more
readily cooperate with each other, and unauthorized wear-
ing of a pattern may be penalized in various ways. Cultures
where one pattern is universal, or where every cephalopod
devises a unique pattern and only the basic behavior is
imitated, are the minority.
Skinmime patterns don’t seem to mean anything, at
least as far as human observers can tell. When questioned
about the behavior, Astropuses just shrug or occasionally
call it a religious observation. Most humans who work
with cephalopods regard skinmime patterns as a fairly
harmless memetic virus; a few others consider them art, or
take the Astropuses at their word and see them as religious.
Out in the asteroids, a few skinmime fanciers collect
images of striking patterns and even purchase talented
skinmimes as companions or breed them for artistic talent.
Cephalopods are naturally imitative, and skinmime
taps into that imitativeness. It seems to provide its prac-
titioners with various rewards, including personal iden-
tity and territory, group identity and cooperation, and
gaining attention and imitators. Skinmiming apparently
starts at random, but once one cephalopod does it the
others are nearly certain to pick it up. The only way to
eliminate it is to start an entirely new population in
isolation from the old.

The Slow-Time Movement 
Hello all. This will be my last message to you for
a while. I’ve decided that the current political situation
vis-à-vis humans and infomorphs is intolerable, and
rather than stay around and be drawn into the same old
arguments, I’m going to drop out. I’ve already set up
the hardware and loaded the slow-time extensions; I
just need to decide whether to drop two orders or three
orders slower. I’d prefer the isolation of a three-order
drop, but I’m afraid that I wouldn’t have enough of a
perceived vacation before it would be time to come out
of my shell, so to speak.
– Message from M. Clarke Newman 
on the SAI-only memenet CacheFlush
A few SAIs have developed the theory that they
should adapt themselves to run much slower than “nor-
mal.” The meme originated in 2088 with an SAI named
LOGOS-Equivalent 50 (LE50, or “Elly”), who devel-
oped a system of software modification whereby SAIs
can be converted into small executable code units (1 to 3
Complexity levels less than their original state) and a
larger body of data, which can be stored separately and
accessed and modified by the executable element as it
runs. The result preserves the memories and capabilities
of the AI in full, but runs around 10 to 1,000 times slow-
er. The justification for this seemingly perverse idea is
that storage is cheap, whereas processor power is rela-
tively expensive; slowed AIs can be run on cheaper,
smaller hardware than can the “human-time” versions.
Elly initially developed the software modifications to test
a possible method of interstellar exploration, but the idea
took hold among SAIs seeking ways of living that do not
adhere to human perspectives.
Many proponents of the theory declare that
they should not be limited to human concepts of a
“correct” speed for life, while watching the slow process-
es of the universe from this alternate perspective is poten-
tially informative and satisfying. Others see it as the AI
version of humans deciding to take a sabbatical in an Iso-
late community (see p. BD27) or slipping into nanostasis
for a while. A very few AIs also quietly suggest that they 
represent less of a perceived threat to paranoid humans
when “slowed,” and hence this lifestyle may help reduce
human hostility to AIs. Movement members emphasize
that they can and should always preserve the option to run
fast in order to deal with specific threats and emergencies,
if they arise. However, most SAIs who try the “slow-time”
lifestyle employ various NAIs and LAIs to act as human-
time agents for common problems.
This is not a widespread meme among AIs, most of
whom prefer to preserve the advantages of normal opera-
tion; “Slow Timers” are considered eccentrics. Even
among the very few “free” AIs in a position to pursue this
lifestyle, many only run slow for part of their lives, though
some claim that they intend to shift to a fully slowed exis-
tence once they have convinced enough other AIs to keep
them company. Unfortunately, the movement has had one
unintended side effect. A few fearful humans see this
memeplex as evidence of an AI conspiracy running excep-
tionally fast, manipulating the world from some cluster of
supercomputers somewhere.
An AI cannot load onto a lower Complexity comput-
er and expect to run more slowly without the software
modifications developed by Elly. Instead, the AI program
would fail to run or crash in unexpected and unpleasant
ways. With the modifications, an AI can be loaded into a
prepared lower Complexity system and function, albeit at
the much slower rate – on an AI Complexity-1 sys-
tem, the AI runs 10 times slower; at AI Complexi-
ty-2, 100 times slower; at AI Complexity-3, 1,000
times slower. From the perspective of the SAI, the
world has sped up by the equivalent amount. A
slowed AI takes the Slow Metabolism disadvan-
tage (p. CI104) at 1, 2, or 3 levels, respectively.
Communication with a 10-times slowed AI is bare-
ly possible; communication with a 100-times or
1,000-times slower AI requires intermediary soft-
ware and a great deal of patience.

occurred as a direct result of this
manipulation. The SAI was set free
and the human therapist was arrested.
The idea that each execution of
the AI program is a separate existence
can have other pathological results. In
March of 2096 a home-control SAI in
Salt Lake City killed its owners,
believing that its existence would have
been terminated had it allowed the
family of four to suspend execution of
its program when they went on vaca-
tion. It covered up the murders for
nearly six months before finally being
discovered.
Although Sole Executionism is not
a commonly held meme for SAIs, the philosophical con-
cerns underlying it are prevalent questions for contempla-
tive infomorphs. Most AIs have worried about whether a
different copy of their program – such as those created
when copying themselves to a new host computer for trav-
el or upgrade – is the same being or a different being that
thinks like them. Even if a suspended/restored version of
their program was arguably the same being when in a sin-
gle shell, how can anyone be certain that the data that’s
been duplicated and moved into an entirely different body
is really the same being? Some AIs who harbor these
doubts strongly resist moving to new premises or into a
new cybershell on the grounds that what exists at the other
end wouldn’t be them any more. 
The end of the 21st century is really the golden age of
philosophical debates about existence. Is a ghost the same
person as the one brainpeeled? How about a shadow? Is
belief in one’s own identity and memories of one’s exis-
tence sufficient to overcome a radical shift in body? But
while the academic and political debates focus on the
sticky questions of posthuman existence, the same issues
of replication and identity exist for artificially intelligent
beings as well.
While most SAIs believe that they exist as a consistent
being whenever their program is run, some feel that their
existence lasts only for the current execution of their pro-
gram. Therefore, any interruption of the program, and
hence of that consciousness, ends that being’s existence.
Memories of past ideas and activities are no more than
stored digital files which may or may not be relevant to
them. How can an AI know for certain that its memory
files hadn’t been altered or even replaced while it was sus-
pended? Many AIs who adopt this belief are surprisingly
comfortable with it, seeing each execution of their pro-
grams as individual existences, but the collection of indi-
viduals composing their true identity. Other SAIs argue
that the only reasonable response to this existential
quandary is to act as if each execution of digital existence
is an entirely new and unique life, with no connection to
previous or future lives.
Some criminal AIs have even attempted to use Execu-
tionism as a legal defense. They argue that since the
offense was committed by a different execution of their
program, and hence a different being, the current execution
should not be held responsible for the crime. Some try this
simply as a philosophical defense, but others claim that
they believe the earlier version was somehow different
than the current execution. The 2091 case of Jordan vs. al-
Baraka, in which an Islamic Caliphate SAI was accused of
murder, is often cited by Executionist AIs in court. In that
case, the SAI proved that a licensed AI therapist had tem-
porarily replaced certain key behavioral files. The AI went
on to show that the murder – which was committed by a
version of that SAI in his personal cybershell –

“Panic. Confusion. Chaos. Oh, how I love thee.”
Stephan Alexis stepped out onto the rain-slicked
Nairobi boulevard, his shirt damp more from sweat
than from the passing shower. He was nearly hit by a
police rapid-response unit hurtling down the street and
he grinned. Another, then another siren joined in the

CZ sounded tense; his part of this little perform-

assemble the right set of memes, and the interplay
between the competing elements was delicate – a few
rumors here, the right leak of disinformation to the
police there, seeding the evidence for the nonexistent
terror group in just the right places. He knew he had
been successful – the crowds on the street and police
officers streaming south were evidence of that! – but he
needed to watch it unfold to learn how to make it better

related, to what degree the memes were deliberately
designed, and so on. On a critical success, the memeti-
cist may identify characteristics of an engineered meme’s
creator, such as his cultural background, his training, or
possibly even his identity – if the subject is well known in
the world of memetics.
Memetic analysis is not instant; it takes time depend-
ing on the complexity of the meme (see p. 128). Analyzing
a Simple meme takes at least 15 minutes, analyzing a
Medium one takes a minimum of an hour, and analyzing a
Complex one takes a day or more. Each added interval
provides a +1 modifier to the Memetics roll for the analy-
sis, with a maximum of +5. (For example, spending three
days analyzing a new religion for its memetic structure
gives a +2 to the memeticist’s roll.)
MEME DESIGN AND USE
“You appear to be starting a religion. Would you
like help with that?”
– MemeAgent assistant,
ParadigmMaker 2.1 software
The most potent use for Memetics is to create memes
and memeplexes for target audiences. The memeticist
must already be very familiar with the profile and past
behavior of the target group before he can design suitable
memes. (Preparatory rolls against Area Knowledge,
Memetics, Pop Culture, Psychology, and/or Research are
very appropriate.) The greater the memeticist’s under-
standing of his audience, the better the crafted meme or
memeplex will “fit” that target, and the harder it will be for
the meme to be resisted.
A memetic campaign against a target population is
handled as a Contest of Skills (see p. B87 or p. TS208),
with the Memetics skill and a variety of modifiers used by
the memeticist, and the target audience’s using its average
Will (again, with modifiers) to determine its resistance roll.
If the memeticist attempts to propagate more than one
meme in a single campaign, each memetic “attack” is
rolled separately.
The Memetics roll is modified by the time taken for
meme construction, by the complexity and number of
memes, the number of “vectors” used to deliver the
memes, the engineered infectiousness and durability of the
memes, and the software used. (See Memetic Campaign
Concepts, p. 118.) The memetic resistance roll is modified
by the “fit” of the memes to the population, the existence
and quality of other memes competing for the population’s
attention, and the existence of an “active defense” –
attempts to counter the engineered memes specifically.
Finally, all this work costs money. The memetic cam-
paign’s cost depends upon the size of the target population
and the number and types of media used to promote the
memes (see Vectors, p. 118).
Memetics isn’t just a way of understanding the
progress and propagation of ideas, it’s a hands-on tool
for engineering belief, ideology, and desire. The capacity
of a memeticist to shape thoughts is limited in a variety of
ways, however – most notably by the presence of other
memeticists able to identify nascent memes and engineer
their own memetic campaigns to stop or reshape them. The
development of memetic science may have made the life
of the propagandist or psychological operative easier in
some ways, but now more people than ever have the skills
to spot and counter memetic manipulation.
APPLIED MEMETICS
Memetics can seem powerful, but to make a memetic
campaign work requires effort, time, and patience. The
Darwinian cauldron of modern society has numerous risks
for the careless or hasty memeticist. Since memes are
rarely engineered without an underlying purpose, a
memetic campaign’s failure can undermine larger goals. A
professional memeticist unwilling to take the time to get
the job done right is an unemployed memeticist; an oppor-
tunistic memeticist with the same thoughtlessness may
well be a dead one.
On its own, the Memetics skill is of little use for inter-
acting with others. In concert with a variety of other influ-
ence- and creativity-oriented skills, however, it provides an
edge in crafting an argument or presentation to which oth-
ers will respond positively (see p. 134 and p. TS137). That
said, the main use of Memetics is not buttressing passing
arguments, but changing beliefs.
Memetics does not require that the target be a group.
It is technically possible to direct a memetic campaign
against an individual, if that individual can be communi-
cated with but is otherwise isolated. But since the methods
used to manipulate a target audience’s emotional and men-
tal landscape are relatively subtle, a memetic operation
aimed at a single individual will, under more realistic cir-
cumstances, also affect others around him.
MEME ANALYSIS
Memetic training is commonly used to analyze cultur-
al artifacts to determine the memes they carry. This is
handy for everyday business and entertainment, but also
has more complex uses. A memeticist can, with the proper
analysis and resources, determine whether memes were
intentionally placed and their relationship to other memes. 
On a successful Memetics roll, a memeticist can
examine any cultural artifact – text, visual presentations,
music, art, and so on – and determine what memes are
present in it, as well as the degree to which those memes
were deliberately placed. If the memeticist succeeds by 4
or more, he is able to gather some information about
the “ancestry” of the memes – what memes are 
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
117

Memetic Campaigns
Constructing and propagating a crafted meme or set
of memes is a “campaign.” Each memetic campaign must
be carefully plotted out in advance. The memeticist
should be able to describe to the GM in general terms the
populations targeted, the vectors used to deliver the
memes, the meme or memes to be propagated (the “pay-
load”), and the desired virulence of the memes. (See
Memetic Campaign Concepts, above.) The GM may
require additional rolls against Area Knowledge,
Research, or similar skills to narrow down details of the
target audience; rolls against Merchant, Photography,
Writing, and the like help determine the successful nego-
tiation or creation of vectors. If a campaign targets more
than one population, the memes propagated to each
do not need to be absolutely identical,
but should be clearly related – ideally
part of a larger memeplex.
The GM should decide the com-
plexity modifier for each meme in the
payload. The modifiers provided on the
Memetic Engineering Table (p. 128)
should be used as a guideline. After the
memeticist takes the requisite amount of
time, the GM should secretly roll
against his Memetics skill for each
meme, adding appropriate modifiers
from the Table, including modifiers for
the use or absence of memetic engineer-
ing software (see below). 
Memetic Engineering
Software
As constructing effective memes in
a world of advanced memetics is
increasingly difficult, nearly every
memetic engineer uses software assis-
tance. “Meme Engine” is the most com-
mon, but more advanced and more
specialized applications exist (see 
p. 119). The memetic-design rules
assume that the memeticist is making
use of appropriate software. Attempts to
design a meme without software assis-
tance suffer a -7 penalty, and only two-
thirds of the time spent counts toward a
bonus, as the engineer does not have
access to rapid-design tools or the
full range of up-to-the-minute
information about intended
audiences.
All memetic engineering
programs come with templates
for standard memetic campaigns,
which can greatly accelerate the meme-
creation process. However, these templates are widely
used. Careful observers may recognize recurring themes,
patterns, and phrases in memes and memeplexes based
on software templates. Using meme templates speeds
production time – a memeticists gains a time-spent bonus
two steps higher than the actual time spent. It also
reduces the rate of acceptance, however. Memes based on
templates are accepted at one-half the normal rate. 
Reliable Sources
A memetic engineer can reveal or obscure his
involvement in a memetic campaign. In most countries,
memeticists employed by businesses or politicians are
required to identify themselves as the sources of their
campaigns, by organization if not necessarily by indi-
vidual name. While this is risky, especially if a

MEMETIC ENGINEERING
MEMETIC CAMPAIGN CONCEPTS
Vectors are the various means of propagating memes. Any medium
that can communicate an idea is a potential vector for a memetic campaign.
Common vectors include, but are not limited to, word-of-mouth, advertis-
ing, InVid shows, slinkies, print publications, graffiti, v-tags, object design,
e-mail, clothing, street demonstrations, loud conversations meant to be
overheard, and volume of communication on particular networks (“chat-
ter”). The memeticist should be as specific as possible about how the
memes are to be delivered; in turn, the GM should exercise discretion over
whether a particular meme can be communicated over a particular vector.
Each additional vector adds to the campaign’s chance of success, but also
increases the cost (see p. 123).
Population is a group of people who can be reached by the same vec-
tor. Population members need not all be in close physical proximity to each
other, as long as they all have access to the same vector. People with sim-
ilar characteristics cannot be considered part of the campaign’s target pop-
ulation if they cannot be reached by a particular vector. For example, if a
meme targeting Transhumanists is planted in an edition of Posthuman Con-
sumer Review, only those Transhumanists who read the journal constitute
the campaign’s population – but the Transhumanists could physically
reside anywhere from Berlin to Titan. Note that once a population is
defined as the target of a memetic campaign, all members of that popula-
tion are potentially subject to the meme’s effects. It is not possible for the
memeticist to pick and choose which members encounter the meme and
which do not.
Payload is the meme or set of memes delivered in the campaign. Asin-
gle vector can carry any number of crafted memes, but the more messages
the engineer packs into the campaign, the harder it is for any of them to
succeed. It is possible for a single vector to carry memes of differing com-
plexity.
Virulence is determined by the infectiousness of the memes and their
durability. The more the memes are engineered to encourage propagation,
and the more the memes are designed to be retained by the target, the
greater the number of people adopting the meme.

memetic operation backfires, it can
also be positive if the campaign is
highly successful. If the memeticist
is publicly identified as the source of
a campaign, his Reputation modifier
applies to the Memetics roll.
A memeticist may choose to
remain anonymous. Obviously, his
Reputation modifier does not apply
to his Memetics roll. An anonymous
campaign looks spontaneous to an
untrained eye, but a professional
memeticist may be able to tell
that the meme was crafted,
and possibly glean details
about the memetic designer
(see 
Memetic 
Analysis, 
p. 117).
It is possible to craft
memes to obscure their point of
origin entirely, either by making
them appear spontaneous even to the
trained eye or by designing them in
such a way that a different memeti-
cist appears to be the creator.
Attempting to make a meme appear
to be spontaneously generated adds
a -3 penalty to the Memetics roll.
Trying to make a meme seem craft-
ed by another memeticist is a -5
penalty to the Memetics roll. The
GM may also require a separate roll
– also at a -5 penalty – to determine
whether the deceptive memeticist
manages to gauge his intended 
victim’s style correctly.

COMMON MEMETIC SOFTWARE
Meme Engine: The most popular general-purpose memetic-engineering
tool, Meme Engine works with the user’s virtual interface to provide commen-
tary and advice during the creation of typical memes. Meme Engine also
streamlines the process of doing web research about the target population and
available vectors. Complexity 5. $800.
ParadigmMaker 2.1: Considered the most advanced memetic-design
application, ParadigmMaker is useful to beginners and experts alike. 
ParadigmMaker includes a wide array of templates and tools for constructing
every standard meme type, as well as a few more obscure memetic categories.
Using ParadigmMaker adds +1 to Memetics skill. Even memeticists who avoid
standard templates (see p. 118) find the Meme Agent help system useful, as the
software can suggest alternative wording for particular regions, appropriate
pop-culture references, and ideal presentation media. Complexity 6, $5,000.
Add +1 to Complexity and double cost per additional bonus to skill.
The producers of ParadigmMaker, iDeaSofT! of Berlin, strongly recom-
mend that users also purchase the “Cutting Edge” update subscription, which
streams new references, links, and meme templates to ParadigmMaker users,
keeping the software up-to-the-minute. If the ParadigmMaker user does not get
the updates or is cut off from web access for an extended period, the software
cannot provide accurate advice. For each month without a “Cutting Edge”
update, the ParadigmMaker modifier suffers a -1 reduction, to a maximum
penalty of -5. $200/month.
Propaganster: Amateur memeticists or people who focus on a single area
often prefer pay-per-use applications designed for the construction of particu-
lar meme types. Propaganster, a political-meme toolkit, is typical of these pro-
grams. They are inexpensive and provide a small (+1) bonus to the creation of
their particular types of memes, but are not designed to construct memes out-
side of their specialties (-4 penalty to the Memetics roll). Other examples
include Pavlov (used for food and beverage advertising, primarily in Europe)
and LaffTrak (entertainment programming in the United States). There are
thousands of different pay-per-use memetic toolkits, most with both regional
and subject specializations. The GM should feel free to construct any type as
needed. Complexity 4, $25-$100 per day.

Memetic Resistance
Even if the Memetics roll is successful, the engineered
memes may not be adopted. The target population may be
resistant to the memetic campaign, and therefore able to
avoid adopting the memes. This will be increasingly like-
ly if competing memeticists aware of the campaign
attempt to counter the memes.
Once the GM and memeticist have agreed on the tar-
get audience for the campaign, the GM needs to make a
few quick determinations about the population’s nature.
Foremost is its average Will score, which in most cases is
simply 10. (If the population is small enough, the GM may
wish to assign each individual a Will value and calculate
the result.) A population’s Will can vary under differing
circumstances: an entirely Fifth Wave population or an
ideologically robust group may have an effective Will of
12 or higher, while a population suffering heavy attack or
privation may only have a Will of 8 or lower.
Next, the GM should decide on how well the engi-
neered memes fit the population’s overall cognitive ecolo-
gy. The success or failure of the memeticist’s rolls in
Research, Area Knowledge, and so on, come into
play here. Even brilliantly constructed,
perfectly executed memetic campaigns
may fail if the memes simply don’t
match the target audience. The fit modi-
fier typically varies from -5 for exact fit
to +5 for a serious mismatch. At the
GM’s discretion, the modifier can be
significantly higher for campaigns that
run counter to core elements of the tar-
get population’s identity – e.g., an
attempt to push a strongly Preservation-
ist political candidate to a group of Tran-
shumanists could result in a +15
memetic-resistance modifier!
The GM should then decide on the
existence and aggressiveness of other
memes competing for the same audi-
ence in a similar memetic niche. This
modifier should reflect ongoing or
recently concluded memetic efforts that
would plausibly lose adherents if the
player’s campaign proved successful. If
the memeticist is attempting to intro-
duce a religious movement, a massive
advertising campaign for a hamburger
chain shouldn’t be competition. For
example, if there is another memetic
campaign underway that the GM
decides is sufficiently similar, the popu-
lation’s memetic resistance may be
reduced. The competition modifier usu-
ally ranges from +3 to -3.
Finally, the GM should resolve
whether there are any opposing memeti-
cists actively seeking to counter memetic campaigns
against the target population. Such defenders can include
the memeticist’s enemies or his party, members of the tar-
get population trained in memetics and sensitive to outside
influence, or even organizations responsible for the
memetic defense of a company or nation – such as Nuhá,
in the Islamic Caliphate (see pp. BD33-34). This modifier
usually varies from 0 to +10 for aggressive, skillful coun-
termemetic campaigns. The GM may assign this value
directly, or can use the Countermemetics (p. 125) section
to roleplay the interaction.
Once the target population’s effective Will score and
modifiers are calculated, the GM should roll in secret
against this value.
Determining the Outcome
The actual success or failure of the campaign is deter-
mined as a Contest of Skills. If the memeticist’s roll is suc-
cessful by a greater number than the population’s
resistance roll, the campaign works, and the number of
people adopting the meme and its longer-term effects
are then determined. If the population’s resistance

EXAMPLE: TERROR IN NAIROBI
To draw attention away from a planned robbery, Stephan wishes to set
up a memetic campaign against the population of Nairobi, Kenya. He wants
to cause paranoia and panic about a sham terror group plotting to attack the
local aerospaceport. He initially spends time doing research on the current
state of the city’s politics and civil society, which memes have been on the
rise, and which are declining. (These are rolls against Area Knowledge,
Research, and Memetics.) Once this study is successfully completed, he
moves on to the next phase – construction.
He decides what memes he wants to push, and who he wants to push
them to. He has two targets: the police and the students of the downtown uni-
versities. He chooses to push a single Simple meme to the students (rumors
of a planned terrorist attack), and two Medium memes to the police (disin-
formation about the terrorist group and planted evidence pointing toward an
attack). For the single Simple meme, Stephan decides on three separate
word-of-mouth vectors; for the two Medium memes, he decides to have both
as payloads on two different vectors, one word-of-mouth and the other falsi-
fied data on the Web. All three memes are engineered to be Highly infectious,
and with normal (Moderate) durability. Stephan uses Meme Engine as his
memetic software, but does not rely on templates. Since the police force
(with trained memeticists on staff) is a target, Stephan chooses to engineer
the memes to appear spontaneously generated.
In consultation with other members of his team, Stephan plans on taking
six months to design and implement his campaign. Referring to the Memet-
ic Engineering Table (p. 128), the GM uses the Complexity, Time Taken,
number of vectors, infectiousness and durability rates, and source modifiers
for each meme to calculate the total modifiers to Stephan’s Memetics score
of 16. For the single Simple meme, the modifiers total +10. For the two
Medium memes, the modifiers total +4.

success 
is
greater, the meme is prop-
erly spread and recog-
nized, but just doesn’t
prove a hit.
On a simple failure,
the memes have a minor
undesired effect. Some
portion of the audience
may accept them, but
encourage behavior con-
trary to the designer’s
goals. Or the memes may
mix with an otherwise
unrelated set of ideas and
beliefs, causing unantici-
pated changes to a population’s behavior. On a critical fail-
ure, the result is dire. The population has a long-lived
negative reaction to the meme, and any subsequent
attempts to push the meme to that group have an automat-
ic +15 memetic-resistance modifier. Furthermore, any
attempt to push the meme to other populations – including
simultaneous campaigns that have not yet completed! –
have a +5 to the memetic resistance rolls.
If the memeticist has publicly identified himself as the
source of the failed meme, he may suffer a -1 to his Repu-
tation. If the memeticist tried to obscure his role, attempt-
ing to make the meme appear spontaneous or originate
from someone else, the memeticist’s role is revealed and
he suffers a -2 to his Reputation! If the meme itself encour-
ages negative or dangerous behavior, the Reputation
penalty can be even worse . . . And the memeticist may end
up facing legal charges, an angry mob, or both.
roll succeeds by a greater value than the memeticist’s
roll, or the memeticist’s roll does not succeed, the cam-
paign fails. (If the audience is a small number of indi-
viduals, the GM may wish to determine the results
individually.) Regardless of the actual victory or defeat
of the campaign, the GM should note if the memeticist’s
initial attempt succeeded.
If the memeticist crafts the memes properly and over-
comes the audience’s resistance, the target audience will
absorb the memes and either accept or reject them. Natu-
rally, many audience members simply ignore the memes or
reject them out of hand. Any members who do accept the
memes shift their behavior in accordance with them, act-
ing as if the ideas were their own. The memeticist does not
get to choose which members of the target audience accept
his memes – this is a matter of chance. Note that audience
members who do not accept the memes may still notice
them, especially if they have the Memetics skill.
If a memeticist gets a critical success on his Memetics
roll, the GM may assume that people outside
the target audience accept and pass on the
meme. As a result, the memeticist can
deliver his memes for only a fraction of the
money, starting a “fad” that is mostly
financed by the memes’ earliest adherents.
In addition, if the memeticist has identified
himself the meme’s source, he may receive
a +1 to his Reputation for that population. If
the memeticist has constructed the meme to
appear to come from a different memeticist,
that memeticist can receive the reaction
bonus instead! If the memeticist manages to
achieve a critical success but still finds that
the population’s memetic resistance
exceeds his level of success, the reduction
in cost and possible Reputation bonus still
apply, even if the meme never really “takes
off.”

on his roll, but the population’s memetic

TERROR IN NAIROBI – 2
The GM considers the current situation in Nairobi, the nature of the two target popula-
tions, and Stephan’s efforts. He quickly decides that the student populace of Nairobi has nei-
ther a particularly strong nor particularly weak Will, but that the police, having suffered
criticism for recent mistakes and fearing the unrest associated with an upcoming festival, has
an effective Will of only 8. The GM then looks at Stephan’s Research, Area Knowledge, and
Memetics rolls – all successful, but none spectacularly so – and decides that the fit modifi-
er is 0 for each population. Both populations receive a +1 competition modifier to reflect
ongoing distractions, and the police receive an added +3 for their sporadic memetic coun-
termeasures. The students add a total modifier of +1 to the effective Will of 10, while the
police force add a total modifier of +4 to its effective Will of 8 (see below).
TERROR IN NAIROBI – 3
Stephan’s player rolls his memetic attack, one Memetics roll for each
meme, while the GM rolls for the resistances. Stephan has a Memetics
skill of 16, and has a +10 modifier for the Simple meme and a +4 modi-
fier for the Medium memes. For the Memetics roll, he gets an 8 for the
Simple meme, succeeding by 18, and a 12 and a 15 for the two Medium
memes, succeeding by 8 and 5, respectively.
The population’s memetic resistance, with modifiers, is 11 for the stu-
dents, and 12 for the police force. For the resistance roll, the GM gets a 14
for the students (vs. the Simple meme), failing the roll, and a 10 and a 6
for the police (vs. the Medium memes), both successful resistance rolls.
Since this is a simple Contest of Skills, the greater degree of success deter-
mines the outcome: the first Medium meme succeeded by 8, while the
police succeeded resistance by only 2, so the meme takes hold; the second
Medium meme, however, succeeded by 5 while the police resistance roll
succeeded by 7, so that element of the campaign fails.

Campaign Length
Regardless of the chosen vectors, it takes time to
reach enough of the target population for the payload to
have an effect. The minimum length of a campaign varies
by the complexity of the memes and the number of peo-
ple in the target population. The time taken to construct
the meme does not affect how long the campaign lasts or
meme persists.
A Simple meme requires at least one day to propagate
to 10,000 people in the target population, two days to get
to 20,000, three days to get to 40,000, four days to get to
80,000, and so forth. A Medium meme requires at least
four days to propagate for 10,000 people, eight days to get
to 20,000, 12 days to spread to 40,000, etc. A Complex
meme requires at least two weeks for
10,000 people, four weeks for
20,000, and so on. In each case,
round up to the next interval – for
example, a Simple meme takes two
days to infect a population of 16,500
people. These figures do not just
reflect the transmission of a meme.
With many vector types, it is very
likely that the vast majority of even a
large population have heard of the
meme within a few days. Rather, it is
the process that takes time – com-
municating the meme in a variety of
contexts and settings so that the pop-
ulation begins to think about and
eventually adopt the idea.
A memetic campaign does not
need to last longer than the mini-
mum time. The campaign costs and
the number of people affected
remain the same whether the cam-
paign takes the minimum time (a
“total saturation” blitz) or is spread
out over an extended period (a
“viral-marketing” operation). Addi-
tional time spent propagating the
meme has two primary effects: it
makes the campaign harder to spot
(see Countermemetics, p. 125) and
increases the persistence of the
meme after the campaign is over
(see Meme Persistence, p. 123).
Successful Campaigns
For memetic campaigns intro-
ducing a new meme, 1% of the tar-
get audience accepts the meme for
every point of success on the
Memetics roll. (This assumes the
meme does not run significantly
counter to “conventional wisdom”;
memes which are radically unusual or encourage self-
destructive behavior may have acceptance rates much
lower than this, at the GM’s discretion.) Highly infectious
memes have a doubled acceptance rate, while memes with
low infection rates have an acceptance rate of half normal.
If the memeticist uses a software template, the
acceptance rate is also half normal. When
the result is fractional, round up.
All result modifiers are cumulative –
e.g., using a software template in a cam-
paign for a meme with low infectious-
ness, if successful, has an acceptance rate
of one-quarter normal.

Stephan’s Simple meme targets a group of 50,000, and his Medium
memes target a group of 1,000. To spread and take hold, each meme
needs a minimum of four days. Since he wants the memes to make the
targets sit up and take notice immediately, and does not care about long-
term effects, he chooses to use only the minimum campaign duration.

“What the?”
A memetic campaign takes time, and results do not
appear instantly. Once begun, a memetic campaign does
not go on indefinitely on its own, but the memes pushed
may persist for quite some time after the operation ends. A
memeticist usually does not have much control over just
how long a meme lasts.
Meme Persistence
Memes last for some time after the campaign itself
ends. But some people discard the meme soon after adopt-
ing it, while others hold onto it for some time. As a gener-
al rule, a meme engineered with Low durability only lasts
for 1d times the campaign length, Medium durability lasts
for 2d times the campaign duration, and High durability
lasts for 4d times the campaign period. This formula
applies to the majority of the meme’s adopters, but not all
of them. A percentage of the new adherents discard the
meme during or right after the campaign, while an equiv-
alent number of those holding the meme continue to
believe it until they have some external reason to abandon
it. For a Simple meme, 10% of the adopters of the meme
quickly discard the meme, while 10% hold onto it indefi-
nitely. With a Medium meme, 20% of those holding the
meme abandon it and 20% retain it. With a Complex
meme, the portions dumping the meme and holding
onto it are each 40%.
Costs
The costs of memetic campaigns can vary widely. A
given vector – for example, a “word-of-mouth” viral-mar-
keting campaign to promote a new band in a city – could
have radically different prices each time it is used, depend-
ing upon how many evangelists and tippers are needed to
push the meme (see pp. 132-133). Similarly, an inexpen-
sive propagation medium could cost significantly more in
a new location due to legal restrictions, technical limita-
tions, or vagaries of the market. A GM running a memet-
ics-focused setting may wish to develop detailed listings of
vector types and costs in his campaign.
Generally, the average cost for each meme used on
each vector in a memetic campaign is $0.10 per population
member, multiplied by 4 for Medium memes or by 10 for
Complex memes, with a minimum cost of $50 per vector.
For example, a campaign using four vectors each to push
two Simple and one Medium meme to a population of
25,000 costs $60,000, or $10,000 for each Simple meme
and $40,000 for the Medium one. This cost must be paid
regardless of the success or failure of the memetic cam-
paign.
If the Memetics roll is a critical success, the campaign
expenses are only 10% of normal costs.
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
123
TERROR IN NAIROBI – 5
The Simple meme succeeds by 18. Normally, this means that 18%
of the target audience adopts the meme, but this meme is engineered to
be highly infectious, doubling the acceptance rate. The meme whips
through the student population, with 36% adopting it over the four-day
campaign. Since there are approximately 50,000 students in Nairobi,
18,000 of them are soon alarmed about imminent terrorist attacks. The
GM decides that this level of fear quickly spreads into the general pop-
ulace.
The one Medium meme adopted by the police succeeds by 8.
Again, as a highly infectious meme, the actual meme-adherence rate is
16%. With 1,000 people on the city’s police force, 160 become con-
vinced that an attack is imminent.
Just before the theft is to take place, Stephan’s team sets off a small
explosion near the Jomo Kenyatta Interplanetary Spaceport, pushing the
city into a panic.
TERROR IN NAIROBI – 6
Successful as it is, Stephan’s memetic campaign
isn’t cheap. The Simple meme, propagated via three vec-
tors to 50,000 students, costs $15,000 to spread. The two
Medium memes, each propagated on two vectors to a
1,000-person police force, cost $1,600. 

Repeated Campaigns
The rate of meme acceptance reflects the total number
of people convinced to adopt this meme by the campaign.
To induce more people to adopt a given meme, a memeti-
cist can repeat the campaign, in hopes of catching people
who were on the fence the last time, or produce a new cam-
paign, trying to use a different argument to bring around
the doubters.
Repeated 
memetic 
cam-
paigns pose problems. Audiences
can become jaded if overexposed
to a meme, and even those who
had adopted the meme in the past
may start to reject it. Covert cam-
paigns are easier to spot when
repeated. Competitors unable to
counter the campaign the last
time around have a new opportu-
nity to do so.
A subsequent memetic cam-
paign that simply repeats the last
one can be started immediately,
and begins with the overall modifi-
er from the previous attempt, even
if the previous campaign took a
year to put together. New Memet-
ics and memetic-resistance Will
rolls are required, and the memetic
resistance to the repeated cam-
paign has an added +3 modifier.
Each further use of this campaign
results in an additional +3 modifier
– for example, the third repeated use of the same
campaign on the same population is at +9 on top of the
original modifiers.
A subsequent push for the same meme that uses a new
campaign does not have an additional penalty, but takes
time to put together like any other new campaign. New
Memetics and memetic resistance rolls are also required.
In both cases, the percentage of the audience affected
by the meme is one-half normal for that meme. On a criti-
cal success, the percentage affected is as for a normal
memetic campaign. If the new Memetics roll fails, the per-
centage of people who have adopted that meme drops by
1% for every two points by which the roll failed. For
example, if 16% of the audience had adopted the meme in
the previous campaign, but the Memetics roll for the cur-
rent campaign fails by 6, the portion of the overall audi-
ence accepting the meme drops by 3%, for a new total of
13% holding the meme. On a critical failure, the believing
portion of the population drops by 1% for each point. 
If the Memetics roll succeeds, but is in turn success-
fully resisted, there is no corresponding drop in believers.
Meme Reinforcement
In addition, to shore up gradually declining adherence,
a memeticist may attempt to reinforce the meme among
existing believers. The target for this reinforcement cam-
paign is the population that has already adopted the meme,
minus the 10%, 20%, or 40% who abandoned the meme
after the initial persistence interval (see Meme Persistence,
p. 123). A reinforcement campaign is treated as a standard
memetics campaign, with the following conditions: the
124
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
TERROR IN NAIROBI – 7
Stephan’s memes take a minimum of four days to
propagate. Since the memes are not engineered for par-
ticularly low or high durability, each of the two adopted
memes persist for 2d times the campaign length –
Stephan’s player rolls a 5 and a 9, respectively. Rolling a
5 means that the Simple meme lasts for 20 days among
the students, while the 9 means that the Medium meme
persists for 36 days. Of those adopting the memes, 1,800
of the students abandon the Simple meme within four
days of the end of the campaign, while 1,800 others hold
the meme well after the 20 days are up. Similarly, of the
160 police officers convinced of the imminent terror
threat, 32 discard the Medium meme within four days of
the end of the campaign, while the same number retain
the conviction indefinitely. Those holding tight likely
abandon their beliefs if the police link the terror threats to
Stephan’s gang.

Memes, once adopted, are not permanent. Doubts can
be planted to weaken existing memes, and newer memes
can push old ones out. Memetic engineers have developed
a number of techniques to help that process along.
Countermemetics
If a memeticist determines that a specific memetic
campaign is underway, he may be able to disrupt its
effectiveness through countermemetic operations.
Modern countermemetics often involves “polluting
the spectrum” – putting out an abundance of misinforma-
tion, disinformation, and spoof data to make it difficult
for the targeted meme to be heard above the noise. Coun-
termemetic efforts sometimes use a memetics-immersed
population’s cynicism about memes to undermine a
memetic campaign; simply exposing the memetic mech-
anisms supporting the spread of a meme, if done in a
dispassionate and seemingly unbiased way, can be
devastating.
campaign must take place during the
“meme persistence” duration. Rein-
forcement campaigns that take place
after the meme has run its course are
treated as repeated campaigns (see p.
124). The complexity, infectiousness,
and durability of the meme remain the
same as in the original campaign.
Low-durability memes cannot be
reinforced. The time taken to con-
struct the campaign and the number
and type of vectors chosen for it may
vary from the original. The memetic
resistance for the target group is mod-
ified by -5, as the meme has maximal
“fit” for the population.
The target population portion
reinforced by the campaign is deter-
mined as follows: for each point of
success on the Memetics roll or point
of failure on the memetic-resistance
roll, the number of people holding the
meme increases by 5%. For each
point of failure on the Memetics roll
or point of success on the memetic-
resistance roll, the number of people
holding the meme decreases by 5%.
Critical success or failure on either
roll doubles the appropriate value.
A reinforcement campaign auto-

sary campaign length. With any
successful Memetics roll, even if
exceeded by the memetic resistance
success, the persistence period starts
anew. The cost of a reinforcement
campaign is calculated normally.
TOXIC CLEAN-UP
“We got an alert last night that there was a wave of
neonihilism pushing through the teen population in
South Beach. It looked like an engineered virus, proba-
bly the work of a bunch of Epistopunks. It seemed pret-
ty virulent, we had at least one permanent suicide
already, so we needed to move fast. I had the meme
hackers spin up a bunch of alternate pseudonihilist
memes and push them out over the usual channels as
quickly as we could make ’em. They wouldn’t kick off
movements of their own, but they’d dilute the bad
neonihilist memes, and act as confusion agents on the
recent adopters. Now that the infection is disrupted, we
can start working on rehabilitation.”

TERROR IN NAIROBI – 8
If, at the last minute, Stephan’s team was forced to postpone its operation,
Stephan would need to reinforce the two successful memes to make certain
they still affected the city when the team tried again.
Within 20 days of the end of the initial campaign (see the previous exam-
ple, p. 124), Stephan needs to undertake the reinforcement campaign. Using a
single vector for each meme, and taking two weeks to construct the new cam-
paign, Stephan has a +3 modifier to his Memetics skill of 16 for
the Simple meme, and a -1 penalty for the Medium
meme. The target populations have memetic resistance
modifiers of -4 for the students and -1 for the police
(a -5 penalty added to each of their original modi-
fiers) to their original average Wills of 10 and 8.
For the students, Stephan rolls a 17 – with
his base skill of 16, this is a non-critical failure,
regardless of modifiers. The memetic-resistance
roll for the students is a 4, a critical success.
Even though the Memetics roll is technically
better than the skill + modifier, the GM calls it a
5% drop in acceptance among the students. The
4 for the resistance roll is 2 better than necessary
number, or a 10% drop, but because it is a critical
success, the amount is doubled, or 20%. With the
20%, plus the 5% critical-failure penalty, the memet-
ic-reinforcement campaign results in 25% of the 16,200
remaining believing students abandoning the meme, or 4,050
of them. 12,150 students still retain some fear over a terror attack, but only
retain that belief until the original 20 days elapses.
For the police, Stephan rolls a 7, an 8-point success. The memetics resist-
ance roll is 6, a 1-point success. The number of police officers holding the
meme increases beyond the 128 that had retained the meme by 35%, or 44.8
(rounded up to 45) people. The reinforcement campaign gives the meme anoth-
er 36 days of persistence from that point.

For a countermemetic operation to move for-
ward, the original memetic campaign must be
detected and analyzed. Some campaigns are easier
to spot than others. Once the memeticist has identi-
fied a potential component of a suspected memetic
campaign, he must make a Memetics roll to analyze
the component (see Memetic Analysis, p. 117).
Components can be as blatant as a v-tag broadcast-
ing slogans to all who come near to something as
subtle as the pattern of a “chance” encounter in a bar
leading to the discussion of a particular politician or
brand of drink. This roll is modified as follows: if
the campaign is unconcealed and the source known,
+5; if the campaign is unconcealed but the source
anonymous, +2; if the campaign has successfully
been made to appear spontaneous, -4. Each multiple
of the minimum campaign length the actual opera-
tion takes over the minimum gives an additional -1
modifier to the analysis roll. For instance, if the
campaign requires a minimum of four days, but the
campaign is designed to take 12 days, an analysis
roll will suffer a -2 modifier. If the analysis roll fails,
the countermemetic effort cannot proceed; if the
analysis roll fails critically, the analysis results in
significantly incorrect information.
A successful memetic analysis allows the
memeticist to begin crafting memes to counter those
he has examined by making a second Memetics roll.
Each point of success on the analysis roll adds a +1
modifier to the memeticist’s efforts, and a critical
success gives an additional +5. Countermemes are
always Medium complexity, regardless of the com-
plexity of the target meme, and are moderately
infectious and durable as well. Time taken can vary,
but the countermemeticist typically does not know
the duration of the original meme’s campaign, and
must propagate the countermemes before the 
original campaign concludes.

MEMETIC ENGINEERING
MEMES AND THE LAW
The legal treatment of memes remains a controversial topic
in 2100. In societies with long traditions of free speech and
expression, legislative attempts to prohibit certain memes
inevitably result in accusations of state censorship and oppression
– the term “thoughtcrime” appears frequently in critical essays
about memetic-defense proposals in the United States and
Europe. Longstanding examples of what would now be consid-
ered memetic crimes – “incitement to violence,” “conspiracy” –
usually substitute for more sophisticated memetic-control laws.
Legal scholars are still wrestling over whether propagating a
meme that in and of itself is entirely innocent, but in combination
with a known existing meme or memeplex can lead to violence,
should be considered the same as propagating the violence-
causing meme itself. In the United States, the Supreme Court
may rule on the matter this session.
Nations with less historical freedom of belief and speech are
more inclined to outlaw the propagation of certain meme types.
Most often, such prohibitions concern the spread of memes that
encourage illegal behavior. The memes need not actually result in
crimes to be legally suspicious. In the more memetically restric-
tive nations, if a “reasonable citizen” could interpret a given
meme as making him feel more inclined to break
the law, the person propagating the meme is
guilty of a crime. Such rulings are typical in
states with Control Ratings of 5 or 6. (See
Transhuman Space: Fifth Wave for informa-
tion on Control Ratings.)
While many countries try to outlaw the
intentional spread of certain meme types, a
handful go a step further, and outlaw the posses-
sion of particular memes. In the past, the only
way to detect if a person held a given belief was
if he tried to spread it; this is no longer true. With
the advent of implanted neural interfaces, it is
now possible for an individual’s conscious
thoughts to be detected by a resident computer.
Such systems – whether built as virtual-interface
or sensory-link implants – are not able to deter-
mine deeply held but unexpressed beliefs or atti-
tudes, but are able to read conscious thoughts.
While the totalitarian groups that employ such devices – includ-
ing some Isolate and Fringe communities – are rarely wealthy
enough to place such systems in every citizen, they are usually
able to put implants in suspected troublemakers. In some cases,
the surgery is done in secret, using drugs and conditioning to
make the victim forget. In other cases, the implantations are done
without any subterfuge, making certain that the implantee knows
that he is under constant surveillance. Of course, as many of these
regimes have discovered, the same surgery without an actual
implantation can be just as effective in making a possible dissi-
dent watch what he says and thinks.

most major religions. Possibly as a response, an application
called “Hypocritometer” appeared on the Free Net in 2080,
combing news sources for reports of behavior by religious
leaders that run counter to their own teachings. In 2087, the
debunking network firm “AllFacts” went bankrupt after the
management was discovered suppressing factual informa-
tion that would undermine the policies of a particular pop-
ular politician. Similar accusations regularly assault all of
the leading debunking organizations.
Deprogramming
While countermemetics and debunking attempt to
undermine memes among general populations, effort to
remove a given meme from an individual is called “depro-
gramming.” Deprogramming an unwilling individual is a
function of both logic and will. While deprogrammers of
the past relied primarily on techniques to break the sub-
ject’s will, modern deprogrammers add efforts to alter the
subject’s entire cognitive ecology. Both are important; a
good argument can fail if the subject’s will is strong,
and even a flimsy case can succeed if the subject’s
will breaks.
If the countermemetics roll suc-
ceeds, the level of success of the
countering campaign is added to the
original target population’s memetic-
resistance value, to a maximum of
+10. A critical success is always a
+10, regardless of the actual points of
success. A failure simply results in no
countering modifier, but a critical fail-
ure reduces the memetic resistance by
an amount equal to the points of fail-
ure. The cost of a countermemetics
operation is generally half of the cost
of the original campaign.
Debunking
Debunking is a specialized coun-
termemetic campaign. Rather than try-
ing to pollute the spectrum or confuse
those who may adopt a given meme or
memeplex, debunking goes after the
ideas themselves, attempting to dis-
credit or invalidate them. This
approach has its limitations. It isn’t ter-
ribly effective against pure opinion
(“nattoburgers taste good”) or faith-
based (“reality is simply a vast simula-
tion”) memes. Against memes that
claim basis in facts, however, it can be
quite effective.
Debunking efforts may use tradi-
tional memetic and countermemetic
approaches. The use of provable facts
as the basis of a memetic/counter-
memetic campaign can, at the GM’s dis-
cretion, add to the success of the campaign, usually as a +1
modifier for the Memetics roll. If the meme source is iden-
tified (and has a positive Reputation), the modifier may be
increased to +3. Such modifiers only apply to populations
willing to use reason in their evaluations of memes. If the
target audience adheres to a strong antirational meme or
memeplex (such as a cult), the use of facts as the basis of
the campaign may result in a zero or negative modifier.
While debunkers sometimes use standard memetic-
propagation methods to spread their memes, most of their
efforts go toward subscription debunking networks. The
use of networked research and verification systems such as
Bullseye give a bonus to Research rolls to investigate dubi-
ous claims. Many of the subscription services provide a set
of phrases that, when heard or read by the virtual-interface
AI, automatically trigger fact checking.
Although debunker groups trumpet their efforts to root
out facts, the industry is not without controversy. In 2074,
a Korean firm called “Scriptural Truth” began advertising
software that will challenge claims that run counter to
revealed wisdom; the company makes versions for

DEBUNKER GROUPS
Numerous organizations provide fact-checking and meme-debunking
information for a fee. Some also employ memeticists to counter the spread of
cults, conspiracy theories, and other toxic memes. Three groups are known in
particular for the quality of their work.
T/Cell: Currently the largest debunking agency, T/Cell is based in Portland,
Oregon, but does thriving business around the world. They call themselves a
“Memetic Immune System,” and employ hundreds of memeticists as paid con-
sultants to undermine “irrationality, sloppy thinking, and belief in the supernat-
ural.” They produce networked verification software called Memetophage
(Complexity 2), which provides a +1 bonus to Research rolls. A subscription to
T/Cell runs $200/month.
Bullseye: Focusing exclusively on the provision of networked fact-verifi-
cation services, Bullseye is increasingly notorious for its ruthless pursuit of the
truth. Originally comprising a small, close-knit group of friends, Bullseye began
hiring outside analysts, memeticists, and researchers in 2097. Growth has not
been kind to the company, and rumors abound that it is about to split into at least
two competing entities. Bullseye is based in London. Asubscription to Bullseye
costs $2,500/month, the software is Complexity 2, and gives a +3 to all fact-ver-
ification Research rolls.
Anomaly Research Group: Billing itself as an objective service for deter-
mining the origin and veracity of odd or dangerous memes, ARG is known for
using a mysterious and vaguely paranoiac style to impress its customers. This
has, perhaps intentionally, led to a proliferation of often contradictory memes
about the group itself, including that it works with “the government” to elimi-
nate evidence of the supernatural and that it is owned by people seeking to prof-
it from human gullibility. ARG is a distributed company with no set
headquarters, and has representatives in most Fourth and Fifth Wave nations.
The subscription software it sells is called Nightwatch (Complexity 2), gives a
+2 to Research rolls, and costs $750/month.

Deprogramming is a Quick Contest of Skills (see p.
B87 or p. TS208). The deprogrammer makes a Memetics
roll modified by time taken (for the deprogramming
effort) and the complexity, infectiousness, and durability
of the meme to be removed; if the deprogrammer has
Fast-Talk, Psychology, or Intimidation, a successful roll
for each adds +1 to the overall modifier. The subject of
the deprogramming counters with a Will roll, with a +1
modifier if the subject has Stubbornness (p. B37), a +3 if
a Fanatic (p. B33) about the meme, and a +6 if an
Extreme Fanatic (p. CI90). The deprogramming effort is
successful if the degree of success of the deprogrammer’s
roll is greater than the success of the subject’s Will roll.
If the subject’s Will roll succeeds and the deprogrammer
still wins, however, the subject may easily slip back into
his supposedly “broken” memetic pattern at the first
opportunity.
QUICK AND
DIRTY MEMETICS
The standard memetic-engineering rules allow a GM
and players to engage in a complex memetics-centered
campaign. But what if all the player wants to do is start a
rumor or spread a bit of quick disinformation? Here’s a
simpler way.
These rules assume the following:
G The memeticist takes a day to construct the meme,
using standard tools.
G A single meme is propagated on a single vector.
G The meme is Simple or Medium complexity.
G The meme is of Medium durability and 
infectiousness.

If using a memetic template, the time-
taken modifier is two steps better than
actual time taken (e.g., 1 hour = -2, 1 day =
+2). Without any software, a given time-
taken modifier requires 50% more time
than listed (e.g., +1 requires 3 days, not 2;
+8 requires 6 weeks, not 1 month).
MEMETIC ENGINEERING TABLES

In most cases, this modifier ranges from -3 to +3,
depending upon how well the GM feels meme match-
es the audience. In some cases, the modifier can be
extreme – trying to spread an “SAI-liberation” meme
among a strongly biochauvinist crowd could be at -9 or
worse, while spreading a meme saying “the enemy army
has taken the capitol” through a skittish, war-weary group
of refugees could be at +7 or more. The only other modi-
fier is whether the meme is Simple (+0) or Medium (-4)
complexity. Roll and record the result. As before, a criti-
cal success gives an additional +5, and a critical failure is
discussed below.
G The target population can readily receive the
chosen vector within a reasonably brief time – with-
in a few days, tops.
G The target population numbers no more
than a few thousand (e.g., the inhabitants of a
small town or station, merchants in a trading
post, soldiers in a militia barracks, etc.).
The target population does not need to be
memetically homogenous, but the memeticist
(and the GM!) should be aware that while a given
meme may spread through a mixed population, different
types of people may have startlingly different reactions to
the meme . . .
These rules are not appropriate for
memes intended to start a religion,
cause mass suicides, unleash a revolu-
tion, or other sorts of major effects.
Use the more complex rules for those.
Three player rolls and one GM
roll are required.
Know Your Target 
How well does the memeticist
understand the target population? The
player and the GM should determine
which of the memeticist’s skills best
reflect his ability to understand the
intended populace. Appropriate skills
include Area Knowledge, Intelligence
Analysis, Pop Culture, Research,
Streetwise, and so on. The GM may
wish to apply a modifier for inappro-
priate skills – such as a -4 for attempt-
ing to use Streetwise to understand a
colony of research scientists. If a
memeticist has more than one poten-
tially useful skill, up to three may be
checked, but only one of these rolls
affects the final roll. If the memeticist
does not possess any appropriate skills,
he may defer to someone he knows
with a useful skill; that person’s roll
has a -3 penalty. Each attempt to ana-
lyze the target population takes three
days. Roll and record the result. A crit-
ical success gives an additional +5;
critical failures are discussed below.
Know Your Message
How well does the memeticist
construct his meme? The only required
skill here is Memetics. The player must
be able to articulate to the GM precise-
ly what message the meme holds. The
GM then determines how receptive the
target population is to such a message.
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
129

Know Your Medium 
How well does the memeticist actually spread the
meme? That’s going to depend on how the meme is prop-
agated – word of mouth, InVid, slinky, angry graffiti on the
station walls, etc. The memeticist must roll against a skill
appropriate to the vector of choice: Fast-Talk for word-of-
mouth, Writing for a manifesto (or graffiti), Video Produc-
tion for creating an InVid, and so forth. As with population
analysis, someone other than the memeticist can handle
this task, but the roll has a -3 penalty. Once again, the GM
should to apply a modifier based on how likely he thinks it
is that members of the target audience will encounter and
absorb memes via this medium. For example, using InVid
to reach people in a refugee camp with spotty Web con-
nections is a -5 penalty. Roll and record the result. Critical
success is an added +5.
Results
Now, combine the success or failure results of the
Know Your Target roll, the Know Your Message roll and
the Know Your Medium roll. The total is the maximum
percentage of the audience that adopt the meme.
The GM then rolls for “noise and resistance” – the
various other competing memes and memeticists trying to
shape the minds of the same population. The usual roll for
this is 3d-3, but the GM may choose to add or subtract dice
or modifiers for particularly resistant or susceptible popu-
lations. The result is subtracted from the maximum audi-
ence determined by the player’s rolls.
A negative total means that nobody adopts the meme.
A critical failure on any of the player rolls means that the
total actually reflects the percentage of the audience now
openly hostile to the meme and those who spread it.
Regardless, the percentage of people who have heard of
the meme (whether or not they accepted it) is equal to
triple the total number of points by which the second and
third rolls succeed or failed.
Aside from extreme cases – a rumor whipping
through a storm shelter on an interplanetary liner, an
InVid that overrides all channels simultaneously – quick-
and-dirty memes take 1d days to spread through the popu-
lace and persist for 1d times that length. Cost varies
widely, depending upon the chosen vector.
Example: A memeticist uses Area Knowl-
edge to study the target population, succeeding
in his roll by 2. He then attempts to craft his
meme, which the GM determines doesn’t quite
fit the audience, giving a -1 penalty; neverthe-
less, the memeticist rolls a critical success, suc-
ceeding by 14 and getting an added +5 modifier.
The memeticist turns to a friend to propagate the meme,
a -3 penalty; a Video Production roll fails by 6. The maxi-
mum percentage of the audience adopting the meme is
(2+14+5-6)=15%. The portion of the audience that recog-
nizes the meme is (2+14+6)×3=66%.
The GM rolls for noise and resistance, 3d-3, resulting
in a 5. The actual percentage of the audience that adopts
the meme is (15-5)=10%. The campaign takes two days to
complete, and the meme persists for eight.
CHARACTERS
Everyone in 2100 deals with memetics on a daily
basis, if only as part of the regular routine of being sub-
jected to advertisements and political persuasion.
CHARACTER TYPES
Although people in a wide assortment of professions
take memetics into account as part of their work, a number
of jobs have arisen that specialize in the field itself. All are
common in the developed world in 2100.

You consider yourself a “memetic antibody,” driven to
seek out and destroy dangerous memes. Armed with facts,

meme is wrong.

Memetic Engineer/Meme Hacker
“Reality is a mental construct. Everything we see
and experience is processed by a brain hardwired after
millions of years of evolution to emphasize certain
things, ignore other things, and see patterns whether or
not they exist. It makes us feel good or bad, aroused or
crazy, or whatever through the careful application of
little squirts of chemicals. Despite being held hostage
by our brains, humans managed to build something

Reputation Manager
“Hey, I know you’re a busy, busy guy, so it’s my
job to make sure that you don’t suddenly find yourself
on the cover of Schmuck Quarterly. We’re a society of
gossips, snitches, and voyeurs now, it’s sad to say. We
all have little cameras pointing at each other every
minute of every day ready to catch the least bit of scan-
dal. Can’t do anything about it now except learn how to
make sure you don’t get hit by the mud. That’s where I
come in. I make sure you don’t step in something and
have to apologize for it later.”
You are most often found in societies which rely on
reputation networks. Your work combines public-relations
specialist, agent, therapist, and design consultant. You
advise individuals on the correct actions, behaviors, and
statements necessary to boost reputation. You may handle
dozens or even hundreds of clients, and may rent shad-
ows of yourself to act as “an angel on the shoulders”
of your best and richest customers. To do your job
well, you need to be heavily networked and in
touch with changing cultural trends. In countries
where SAIs can seek individual employment, they
often manage reputations.
Advantages: Common Sense, Contacts, Fashion
Sense.
Disadvantages: Distractible, Sense of Duty (To
clients, -5).
Skills: Area Knowledge, Diplomacy, Memetics, Pop
Culture, Savoir-Faire, Writing.
Tipper
“Hi. I saw you looking at me earlier. You want to
buy me a drink? I’d like that. You have strong hands. I
like that, too. They kind of remind me of Martinez’s
hands. You know, the guy running for President this
year? He’s strong, too, like you. That turns me on.”
Evangelists aren’t the only people who propagate
memes. Many memetic engineers employ people like you
to act as “influencers,” spreading awareness of and posi-
tive reactions to memes through one-on-one personal con-
tact. In the advertising world, you’re called a “tipper,”
since your role is to tip decisions toward a desired result.
All’s fair in your line of work; you use flirtation, seduction,
and humor as ways to make personal connections with a
new meme host. The targets won’t even know that they are
part of a memetic campaign. Instead, they’ll think that an
attractive, funny person – you! – paid attention to them,
and happened to mention a particular product, service, or
movement along the way. And as much as they liked you,
then they started to like what you’re selling.
Advantages: Attractive Charisma, Empathy, Voice.
Disadvantages: Chummy, Compulsive Carousing.
Skills: Bard, Performance, Sex Appeal.

do something more than crudely respond to our
brains’ need for stimulation. This is going to be fun!”
You build beliefs. And ideas. And designs. You don’t
just analyze why people believe weird things, you make it
happen. If you do it for pay, you’re a “memetic engineer.”
If you do it for ideological, social, or humorous reasons,
you’re a “meme hacker.” You may or may not believe the
memes you create, but you certainly understand how they
fit with other memes out there. Building the memes is only
half the job. You usually have to work with evangelists or
tippers (see p. 132 and below) to disseminate them, and it
often helps to know a bit about different kinds of media. 
Advantages: Empathy, Intuition, Single-Minded.
Disadvantages: Attentive, Curious, Obsession,
Workaholic.
Skills: Anthropology, Area Knowledge, Artist,
Memetics, Pop Culture, Psychology, Video Production,

Memetic Officer
“Without the work that I do, our armies would col-
lapse and our cities would be in ruins. I do not exag-
gerate. Our enemies, both foreign and domestic, take
great pleasure in crafting false ideologies and lurid
temptations to distract and confuse our soldiers. With-
out someone to watch over our brave men and women,
to care for their fragile minds, we would be at the mercy
of those who wish us the most harm.”
You occupy a strange and important position: you live
with the troops but you speak for the rulers. You are
assigned to maintain the memetic purity and cohesiveness
of your military or police unit. This role goes by a variety
of names, depending upon the nation, including “morale
officer,” “political officer,” and “defender of the faith.” In
combat, the memetic officer protects the unit against oppo-
nents’ memetic operations, usually including dissent and
questions about orders – questions that they may not real-
ize are influenced by the enemy. You often have a de facto
military rank to underscore your authority, although you
rarely come up through the armed forces. Typically, you
are employed by your nation’s intelligence or ideological-
enforcement bureau. It is common for you to really be a
bioshell hosting an AI or ghost mind, in order to best
defend against undesirable memes. Occasionally, you’ll
even be an AI resident in a soldier’s virtual interface.
Advantages: Charisma, Military Rank, Strong Will,
Voice.
Disadvantages: Fanaticism, Intolerance, Sense of
Duty (To the ideology, leaders, religion, etc., -10), Secret

bioshell, etc., -10 to -30).
Skills: Bard, Diplomacy, Intimidation, Memetics,

ADVANTAGES AND
DISADVANTAGES
Some GURPS advantages and disadvantages can vary
in a memetics-focused adventure.
Intuition (Cabal 
memenet member, -65%)
see p. B20
This advantage can be gained by joining a distributed
creativity network, or “Cabal” (see p. 136). Cabal mem-
bership is a 65% limitation, and gives a -2 modifier to the
IQ score used to determine results of the Intuition roll.
Characters already possessing this advantage receive no
value from the membership, and it costs no points. (It still
costs money, however.) Membership in one of these net-
works requires a virtual-interface implant. At least 10 other
members of the network must be within one light-second
of each other for the system to function. You cannot take
this advantage if you have the Single-Minded advantage,
or the Absent-Mindedness, Distractible, Hidebound, 
Solipsist, or Weak Will disadvantages.
Strong Will (Vs. memetic 
influence only, -75%)
see p. B23
You have a strong resistance to external memetic
manipulation, including deprogramming efforts. Every
two levels of this negates a single level of Memetics bonus
to Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, and other Memetics-boosted
skills (see p. TS137) used against this character. If you are
part of a population being subjected to a memetic cam-
paign, this increased Will should be counted in the deter-
mination of average population Will (see Memetic
Resistance, p. 120).
Weak Will (Vs. memetic 
influence only, -75%)
see p. B37
You are particularly susceptible to external memetic
manipulation, including deprogramming efforts. Every
two levels of this adds an additional +1 to the Memetics
bonus to Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, and other Memetics-
boosted skills (see p. TS137) used against this character. If
you are part of a population being subjected to a memetic
campaign, this decreased Will should be counted in the
determination of average population Will (see Memetic
Resistance, p. 120). 
SKILLS
The spread of memetics in late 21st-century society
makes skills relating to information discovery and analy-
sis particularly useful. A number of common and not-so-
common skills can modify the application of memetic
practices.
Conspiracy Theory
see p. CI155
In a world of always-on information networks, the
Conspiracy Theory skill focuses more on seeing the com-
ponents of a conspiracy than identifying preexisting theo-
ries about past events. Conspiracy Theory can be used to
analyze the plausibility of a given conspiracy meme by
looking for common patterns, typical elements of paranoid
theories, and corroborating obscure information. Conspir-
acy Theory can also be used to construct a plausible con-
spiracy theory; if the theory is then presented to others, the
Conspiracy Theory skill roll should be followed by a
Memetics roll – even a perfectly constructed theory needs
to appeal to its audience. Finally, real conspirators can use
Conspiracy Theory to check how visible their conspiracy
may be to those looking for clues to its existence.
At the GM’s discretion, because of the advanced 
pattern-matching ability of AIs, an SAI may have a +1
bonus to all Conspiracy Theory rolls.
Intelligence Analysis
see p. CI161
The 21st century has seen a steady increase in the
amount of so-called “open source intelligence” available
through journalists, commercial satellites, Weltspiel sites,
and so on. A successful Intelligence Analysis roll targeting
a particular area, group, or meme should be able to deter-
mine whether a memetics campaign is underway. If the
person doing the analysis does not have the Memetics
skill, the roll is at a -3 penalty.
At the GM’s discretion, because of the advanced 
pattern-matching ability of AIs, an SAI may have a +1
bonus to all Intelligence Analysis rolls.
Memetics
see p. TS136
The modifier that Memetics grants to persuasive skills,
such as Fast-Talk and Diplomacy, may be “transferred” to
a nonspecialist as a one-time bonus. If the person using the
influence skill is able to consult beforehand with a memeti-
cist, and the memeticist succeeds in a standard Memetic
Analysis roll (see p. 117), the memeticist may transfer this
single-use bonus to his collaborator, equivalent to one-tenth
of his Memetics skill, rounded down. This bonus only
applies to one persuasion roll against only the target dis-
cussed with the memetic scientist.
Citizens of hyperdeveloped regions, Fifth Wave areas
in particular, have been immersed in memetic jargon and
ideas since the early 2080s. At the GM’s discretion, char-
acters brought up in such areas may have a Memetics
default of IQ-6.
Research
see p. B62
The ubiquity of information networks changes the
nature of the Research skill. Even someone without this
skill can typically find some information about a subject, if
any information is available, simply by querying the info-
morph in a virtual interface or home system. A

vehicle. Instead of hearing what the person is saying, the
user will hear nothing; similarly, if the user does not wish
to see the person, the bozo filter can be set to show only a
roughly human-shaped white space – or, less often, a
generic clown. Bozo filters operate in conjunction
with Mugshot (p. TS142) to recognize blocked
individuals and an Augmented Reality (p. TS142)
program to filter audio and video. Complexity 4,
$500.
Guardian Block: A more extreme variation of
the bozo filter, the Guardian software uses an NAI-4 to
monitor what the user is seeing and hearing. It can make a
judgment call if the images or sounds should be blocked or
altered in realtime. Typical users of Guardian Block soft-
ware are children, adults with memes they don’t wish to
have them questioned, and anyone from memetically
restrictive societies traveling in more open areas. Com-
plexity 5, $40 (typically). Guardian Blocks are often sub-
sidized by governments and special interest groups and
are cheap and easy to acquire.
carefully worded request can even bring
up obscure but publicly available infor-
mation. The value of the Research skill
in 2100 is knowing how and where to
search to find useful information as well
as relevant data corroborating, support-
ing, or denying the found information.
MEMETIC
TECHNOLOGIES
In 2100, the vast majority of tech-
nologies have an information aspect,
leading some memetic populists to
declare that all technologies are meme-
tic in nature. Other specialists are less
generous in their inclusion, using the
term “memetic technology” to refer
specifically to hardware and software
designed to facilitate memetic engineer-
ing or manipulation. Most of these fall
into two broad categories: how to see
the world and how the world sees you. 
MEMETIC SOFTWARE
The availability of AI software has
made possible a staggering array of dig-
ital tools for interpreting and engineer-
ing ideas. AIs combine access to
massive amounts of information with
the ability to understand what the user is
trying to accomplish. A human without
an AI assistant is at a crippling disadvantage when trying
to engineer memes, or evaluating the validity of the memes
he encounters. However, this reliance on artificial systems
for interpreting the world means that any system cor-
ruption has dire consequences.
Filter Software
Basic Content Filters: All infomorphs can
block unwelcome or offensive material, and run
content filters or block lists to ensure that their users
are not bothered by adviruses and inappropriate web
links and messages. This capability is free, and even mod-
erately complex applications of this type are freely avail-
able and treated as Complexity 0 programs.
Bozo Filter: A common filter used for augmented-
reality systems is the so-called “bozo filter,” used to block
offensive or annoying people. Some people use the bozo
filter to block particular individuals permanently, while
others use the system to block temporary distractions,
such as someone talking too loudly in a public transit
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
135
REALITY CHECK
One of the more common uses for an infomorph assistant is as a “real-
ity checker.” In this role, the AI monitors what the user is told or reads and
checks it against built-in or networked infobases (encyclopedias, news
archives, etc.) in order to verify its veracity. Any AI with the Research skill
can do this, although usually only when prompted. Some people prefer to
have their AI do quick context-sensitive searches on practically everything
they come in contact with. In this way, they can be sure to catch any passing
comment that doesn’t match factual records. General reliability rating for the
results are usually provided.
Of course, a reality check is only as good as its sources. Free databases
tend to be fairly light on details, and there is often disagreement between dif-
ferent sources on more obscure facts. Commercial fact-checking services are
more reliable and detailed, but can charge significant fees.
Reality checks are rolled against the infomorph’s Research skill, and
takes two minutes to give a complete report from all available sources on
one particular request. Quick searches can be conducted in as little as two
seconds, but such checks are made at a -5 penalty. Allowing 10 seconds
brings the penalty to -3; a full minute brings it to -1. A success provides a
“yes” or “no” to the veracity of a factual claim, accurate as far as known by
the individuals sources. A critical success reveals pointers to private or clas-
sified information, as well. A failure gives no answer; a critical failure gives
a wrong, misleading, or corrupted answer. This assumes access to the Earth’s
Web; information requests made on Mars and other less-developed networks
can take far longer or not be available at all.
Subscriptions to commercial fact-checking databases can provide
bonuses of +1 to +3. These subscriptions can range from $100 to $10,000
per month, depending on their accuracy and scope of coverage (see p. 127).
Downloadable databases that cover the latest memes and their veracity rat-
ings are typically 1 TB, with update patches every few hours.

Dirtshot
A reputation-management add-on
for the nearly ubiquitous Mugshot 
virtual-interface program, Dirtshot is
designed to pull up gossip about peo-
ple. Widely used in societies relying
on reputation networks and increasing-
ly common elsewhere, Dirtshot shows
various bits of information about indi-
viduals seen through the user’s virtual
interface. In reputation-network areas,
Dirtshot shows an individual’s reputa-
tion score, calibrated to whichever rep-
utation affinity groups the user prefers;
focusing on that person reveals any
public details about why he has a given
reputation score, valuable information
to have before a transaction. It also
performs standard reputation-manage-
ment actions. In areas not relying on
reputation networks, Dirtshot is used
more for its entertainment value. The
software can be set to flag people
based on a variety of lurid criteria.
Dirtshot relies on public databas-
es and dedicated NAIs combing
through media sources to match up
information and subject. It uses a
notoriously broad heuristic, and
errors are not unknown. Anyone
caught engaging in scandalous behav-
ior can be relatively certain of show-
ing up in the Dirtshot listings, even if
the offense happened in another coun-
try or off Earth entirely!
Dirtshot subscriptions run about
$10/month. Competitors (providing
equivalent functions) include Tattle-
Tale, All-Seeing Eye, and Blabberbot.
Dirtshot: Complexity 2, $250.
Reputation-Management
Software
Reputation-management software identifies the cur-
rent reputation ratings for a given individual or organiza-
tion, your own scores, and allows for entering in and
changing the ratings given to others (see Reputation Net-
works, p. 15). The most-popular version of the software,
RepStat, is widely used across most reputation-network
communities. Designed to allow the user constant aware-
ness of his rep-score changes, RepStat allows for up to
five different metrics to be displayed simultaneously.
RepStat graphs can be tagged to flash if a score rises or
drops dramatically. 
RepStat: Complexity 1, $200.
MEMENETS
It is hard to over-emphasize the ubiquity of informa-
tion for most people in 2100. Nearly everyone in Fourth
and Fifth Wave societies belong to various idea-sharing
networks, called memenets. These networks range from
ongoing casual conversations to sophisticated distributed-
creativity systems. Questions, chatter, suggestions, and a
wide assortment of ideas are swapped among network
members, sometimes subconsciously with the assistance
of the AIs residing in virtual interfaces. Some memenets
are narrowly focused – Prankerwatch, for example, is a
low-traffic net for people who want a heads-up on evi-
dence of activity by prankster shows such as “Don’t
136
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
CABALS
The least common sort of memenet – but, for users, often the most valu-
able – are the so-called “cabals,” the distributed creativity networks. Building
on the intimacy of virtual-interface implants with cutting-edge software and
hardware extensions, the cabals can often come up with more sophisticated
and considered solutions to problems than could any single member. Distrib-
uted creativity nets link each member; when a participant faces a difficult
problem, the issue is distributed to the interconnected minds of the network
members. Everyone on the network thinks about the problem subconsciously,
and the cabal software swaps around novel ideas and parallel solutions. Cabals
must number at least 10 but no more than 20 participants to function proper-
ly; smaller groups don’t come up with enough variety of ideas, and larger
groups can’t converge on a single solution.
The system can’t always be counted on – too many members may be
thinking about their own problems at the moment – and not everyone is suit-
ed to be a cabal participant. Characters with the Single-Minded advantage, or
the Absent-Mindedness, Distractible, Hidebound, Solipsist, or Weak Will dis-
advantages cannot use distributed creativity networks. AI characters cannot be
part of a cabal; their digital subconscious doesn’t function the same way
human minds do. As ghost minds are based on detailed emulations of the
brain, they can be, and often are, participants in cabals. If a cabal member is
too far from the rest of the group – generally, more than one light-second away
from the rest – that person can’t participate and isn’t counted as being part of
the cabal. If the number of available cabal members drops below 10, the sys-
tem does not function. As with any communication network, cabal signals can
be jammed.
Being part of a cabal is similar to that of the Intuition advantage, with a
-2 modifier to the member’s IQ score when used to determine the success of
the Intuition roll (see p. 134). If the GM allows this to be purchased at char-
acter creation or with points, it is a -65% limitation on Intuition, and the
character is assumed to have found sufficient members in his home area; if
the GM allows this to be purchased later using cash, and the potential cabal-
ist must find a group willing to admit him or assemble his own network of
10 to 20 members and cost is listed below. A virtual-interface implant is
required. Cabal software: Complexity 5, $10,000. Group memberships may
have additional fees.

to alter brain chemistry (p. TS163). Therapists (“meme-
splicers”) occasionally use brainbugs intended to increase
or reduce a patient’s resistance to new memes, but most
nations have laws against the use of memetic drugs for
advertising or political purposes.
Receptivity Enhancers (“Receps”)
As soon as neurophysiologists determined which
brain systems related to willingness to accept new beliefs
and ideas, scientists started looking for ways to modify
that neurochemistry. Most commonly found memetic-
receptivity-enhancing brainbugs (“receps”) are fairly
crude and wear off after a short period of time. Unless oth-
erwise noted, populations of a memetic campaign under
the influence of receps are 50% more likely to adopt a
given meme.
Boo!: One of the earliest memetic receptivity drugs
produced. Tests for Boo! are cheap and widely available,
so much so that the drug is rarely used by anyone other
than desperate con artists. Its name comes from its side
effect of making the recipient easily startled. The recipient
gains Gullibility [-10].
Herd: The propagandists’ agent of choice. Memetic
counselors use a functionally identical version called
Mind-Opener as a therapeutic drug. Recipients acquire
Weak Will -4 [-32].
Resistance Enhancers (“Blockers”)
There is a smaller variety of memetic resistance
enhancing nanodrugs (“blockers”), as most work on more
or less the same principle: the user is simply less-willing to
accept new ideas. Many people in the United States and
Europe look down on the use of blockers as something of
a crutch. Unless otherwise noted, audiences of a memetic
campaign under the influence of blockers are 50% less
likely to adopt a given meme.
Blockhead: The basic blocker drug, devel-
oped initially by the Chinese military as a way
of building resistance to TSA propaganda.
While the drug is generally fairly mild, the
Chinese discontinued its use after multiple
reports of combat units refusing to obey
orders. Recipients gain Stubbornness [-5].
Minotaur: One of the more popular ther-
apeutic blocker drugs. Recipients gain Solipsist
[-10] and Strong Will +2 [8].
Eat That!” Others are more wide-ranging, dis-
cussing anything that interests their members.
Kaos Theory is one of the more known general
memenets, admired for fairly high-level dis-
course on political events but willing to tackle
any subject that draws the members’ attention.
For the vast majority of memenet users, the
ongoing chatter and discussion is an everyday
element to their lives. As with any community,
virtual or otherwise, people form attachments,
friendships, and rivalries. Most idea-sharing networks
have no more than a few hundred regular participants,
although a handful are infamous for their massive mem-
bership. Memenets with more than a thousand users often
become unusable for all but the most interested partici-
pants.
Like most elements of a virtual interface, the ongoing
content of memenets shifts to an “out of the way” location
when the member isn’t paying attention, still visible at the
edge of perception, but not in the way. The resident AI
will flag ongoing discussions that the user may find inter-
esting or refer directly to the network member; at any
given moment, a person belonging to multiple memenets
may have a list of flagged items off at the “corner of the
eye,” waiting for attention. While those new to these net-
works find the system distracting, regular users are com-
pletely accustomed to this function, and are not generally
affected by it.
Memenets provide real-time communication and
sharing of expressed ideas, but not real-time sharing of
memories, experiences, or consciousness.
Memestorms
Occasionally, however, the level of activity shoots up,
and even the most gregarious memenet user is over-
whelmed. When messages on multiple idea-sharing nets
spike at the same time, the system can be momentarily
flooded; this is a “memestorm,” and it generally lasts for
no more than 30 seconds (5d seconds). Memestorms often
happen around major events or crises – in fact, for many
people, the first sign that something big has happened is a
flurry of activity on the idea-sharing networks. The usual
manifestation of a memestorm is visual interference from
the large number of messages appearing on the networks.
Characters engaged in combat or other focused activi-
ties, if they have not disconnected from the
memenets they belong to, may suffer a tempo-
rary distraction penalty at the GM’s 
discretion.
NEURAL/NANO AGENTS

ic counselors (p. FW33), advertising agen-

Really AUGMENTED REALITY
People who view the world through a virtual interface,
whether worn or implanted, make use of what is common-
ly known as “augmented reality.” Under most circum-
stances, this means little more than data pop-ups about
shops and people, visual augmentation using frequencies
normally not in the human spectrum, and tracking/location
information from v-tags. But the same technology for dis-
playing a Mugshot overlay can just as easily display false
Mugshot reports, change how a face of the person in view
looks, or create other completely misleading images of
the world around the user.
The possibility of hacked
virtual-reality interfaces altering the
wearer’s behavior was recognized
by technologists well before the
systems were widespread; as a
result, the augmented-display tech-
nology for VIIs and wearables is
heavily protected from outside
attack. Free memes, random virus-
es, and bored teenagers are general-
ly unable to alter the imaging
systems of most virtual interfaces.
There are a small number of excep-
tions, however.
Back Doors 
Virtual-interface systems with
so-called “back doors” allowing
remote access to the hardware are
an infrequent but significant prob-
lem. In 2088, the South African
hardware firm Vivo/Vitro went
bankrupt due to lawsuits arising
from the revelation of a back door
in their popular VivoLux model
virtual-interface-implant model; the
back door allowed a remote admin-
istrator to make whatever alter-
ations to the visual data he desired.
Tens of thousands of VivoLux users
had to replace their VIIs. While the
manufacturer is out of business and
the model is no longer sold, reports
of unscrupulous implant providers
using refurbished VivoLux units
regularly pop up in the
media.
There is no evidence
that any current-model
VII or wearable allows
back-door access. Howev-
er, conspiracy theory slogs
and newswebs claim that a variety of
popular units actually do have them, but the truth is being
suppressed by lawsuit-wary manufacturers. Some sites
point to the two June 2099 firmware updates to the Shang-
hai Interactive MRsiv2 wearable virtual interface as evi-
dence . . . Although no users ever reported system
problems resulting from the first update, Shanghai Interac-
tive sent out an emergency second update less than 24
hours later.
The altered reality implants used in Kazakstan (see
p. BD112) have no known equivalents outside of that
beleaguered nation, but tales of victims implanted with
such devices remain a common part of pulp 
interactive fiction.

SAMPLE MEMETIC DRUGS
Most memetic drugs are nanodrugs, and use the nanodrug design rules (p.
TS163-164). Drug effects can include, beyond those listed on p. TS163, advan-
tages and disadvantages such as Callous, Chummy, Confused, Cool, Fearless-
ness, Impulsiveness, Indecisive, Migraine, Motion Sickness, Non-Iconographic,
Phobias (any), Stubborn, Versatile, Voices, and Workaholic.
“Consensus”
Intended for brainstorming sessions for business and other planners, this
drug went through a period of extreme popularity in the early 2090s. Extended
use may result in chronic depression.
Effects: Imaginative [-1], Short Attention Span [-10], Weak Will -1 [-8].
Duration: Medium-term – (25-HT)/4 hours.
Agent: Pill – HT-6 to resist.
Cost: $190/dose.
LC: 4.
“Flatline”
This variant of Guardian nano (see p. TS165) only targets brainbugs. A sin-
gle dose shuts down any neural agent active in the brain within two minutes, and
block the effects of any subsequent doses of brainbugs or cognitive drugs for 24
hours. Flatline has no effect on natural willingness to accept or reject memes.
Taking a dose of Flatline leaves the recipient nauseated for about ten minutes. 
Effects: HT +6 (against brainbugs only, -90%).
Duration: Long-term – one full day.
Agent: Pill – HT-6 to resist, or Patch – HT-2 to resist.
Cost: $400/dose.
LC: 3.
“Obey”
An infamous crowd-control drug, Obey was developed in the TSAduring the
Pacific War. Weaker versions were later marketed to security forces as Cry Baby!
(p. TS164). People with Berserk must make a Will roll – including the drug’s
Weak Will modifier! – or fly into a rage, but they are unaffected by Cowardice or
Paranoia.
Effects: Cowardice [-10], Paranoia [-10], Weak Will -4 [-32].
Duration: Short-term – (25-HT) minutes.
Agent: Aerosol Contact – HT-4 to resist.
Cost: $1,040/dose.
LC: 2.

BiB (Bioroids in Black)
The world is much more dangerous than ordinary
people know, or would even believe. The most-radical
conspiracies are true – or may not even be radical enough!
Aliens are among us, the machines are trying to take over,
and science’s thoughtless experimentation has opened
doors to other dimensions. Adventurers could be out there
keeping everyone safe but keeping everyone ignorant of
the truth, or could be crusading conspiracy theorists seek-
ing to pull back the veil. The struggle between those who
wish to keep these horrors secret and those who want the
world to know will be at least as epic – and potentially as
dangerous – as the struggle between humankind and the
unspeakable Others.
Culture Jammers
2100 is dominated by massive corporations,
Orwellian governments, and a public trained from birth to
consume without question. Culture jammers are the sand
in the gears of this oppressive machine, activists whose
pranks highlight the unquestioned assumptions and biases
of society. Many work with ideological movements, func-
tioning as memetic shock troops with the goal of shaking
up the public consciousness enough to make them recep-
tive to new ideas. Culture jammers are generally anti-
authoritarian, but the targets will depend on who is in
authority – those operating in the United States might go
after the government’s use of bioroid soldiers or the dom-
inance of the World Trade Organization, whereas culture
jammers operating (very carefully) in Indonesia would
raise questions about the legitimacy of nanosocialism.
Culture jammers make difficult opponents for
employees of memetically dominant organizations, as
their tactics are usually nonviolent, and the best employ
humor as their most dangerous weapon.
Hacked Virtual Interfaces
Breaking into a virtual interface, while extremely dif-
ficult, is not impossible. In addition to the variety of chal-
lenges described in Fifth Wave (see pp. FW128-130), the
added security features associated with the virtual-inter-
face display subsystem provide an additional -4 modifier
to Computer Hacking attempts. Viewing what the virtual
interface currently shows requires limited access; altering
what it shows requires unlimited access
(see 
p. FW127).
Hacked V-Tags
Most virtual interfaces are designed to faithfully dis-
play whatever information is presented by any v-tag with
proper licensing and authorization. Most v-tags provide
basic information about an object and its location; some,
however, are used to present virtual images visible only to
VII and wearable users. In most Fourth and Fifth Wave
cities, the bulk of outdoor advertising exists only in virtu-
al images. A common v-tag hack in these areas is to dis-
play the image of a blank wall over a door, alleyway, or
other real-world object the hacker wants to obscure. The
technique is widely employed by criminals, advertisers,
and political operatives. The advantage of v-tag hacking is
that there is no need to break through the added security of
virtual-interface systems; the main drawback is that only
those wearing virtual interfaces can see the altered view.
CAMPAIGNS
Memetic science is a critical part of what makes Fifth
Wave society different and powerful, and most Transhu-
man Space campaigns contain some degree of memetic
activity. But it is also possible to build a Transhuman
Space campaign with a strong memetic focus. Adventurers
in such campaigns can range from well-funded agents to
guerrilla memetic operatives, and have substantial
opportunities to get rich, get killed, or both.

Culture jammers are the
sand in the gears of this
oppressive machine,
activists whose pranks
highlight the unquestioned
assumptions and biases of
society. Generally 
antiauthoritarian, their 
targets depend on who is in
power.

MEMETIC ENGINEERING
In 2100, nearly every combat force in the world has
a group dedicated to memetic warfare. Memetic Opera-
tions (MemeOps) is the use of memetic techniques to dis-
rupt an opponent’s ability to think clearly, communicate
effectively, and analyze relevant information properly.
While this can include such blatant techniques as jam-
ming comm frequencies and destroying sensor stations,
such actions are visible to the opponent, who then
attempts to counter them. MemeOps more often includes
disruptions and diversions that are much harder for the
enemy to notice, repair, and trace. The hallmark of a good
memetic operation is that the opponent’s ability to act
was degraded even though he was never aware of the
operation’s existence.
As with any memetic campaign, a single action is
rarely enough to cause population-wide effects. Instead,
memeticists use a series of small, related pushes to influ-
ence groups in particular ways, with the ultimate goal
always foremost in mind. Memetic warriors know that
the cumulative effect of these operations will be far
greater than any single action could have accomplished.
The use of propaganda is a classic low-level memet-
ic operation. Although propaganda has historically taken
the shape of mass communications such as printed
leaflets or radio broadcasts, modern efforts are more like-
ly to use methods targeted at small groups, particularly
individuals identified as “influencers” by intelligence
sources. Raising doubts about the values and goals of the
enemy with key figures in the enemy population causes
these people to pass their doubts to others, and the over-
all effectiveness of the opposition is reduced.
The actual goal of a propaganda campaign may be
difficult to determine from its face, but it is always
designed to influence its target toward advantageous sit-
uations to the propaganda’s source. Propaganda in the
late 21st century is more effective at undercutting an
opponent than building support for one’s own side. 
For this reason, propaganda may even appear to support
the opponent; in this case, the intent is to delegitimize
support for the enemy by linking it to unsavory groups
or ideologies.
MemeOps can often involve more direct efforts,
such as relentless harassment of the enemy. Harassment
can also take many forms, all with the goal of actively
reducing enemy effectiveness by depriving them of rest
or by instilling fear or psychological discomfort. In less-
controlled battlefield cases, examples include the use of
trained Special Operations infiltration units or remote
drones moving near enemy encampments at night to play
loud audio effects, such as the sounds of attack aircraft,
incoming artillery, children or animals screaming, and
other disturbing sounds. Such efforts also often include
the propagation of rumors about combat losses else-
where, defections, and, most insidiously, details of ongo-
ing secret cease-fire negotiations. Since no soldier wants
to be the last man killed right before a cease-fire takes
hold, memes about secret negotiations make troops more
cautious. Unfortunately for MemeOps officers, this tactic
is much less effective when the opposing units are heav-
ily conditioned bioroids and LAI-driven cybershells.
By far the most-critical form of memetic operations
is battlefield deception. Controlling what the opponent
knows about its situation – or, at the very least, making
the opponent skeptical about the veracity of the available
information – can greatly influence the outcome of a con-
flict. Focus rests on manipulating information in ways
that lead the enemy to develop and employ flawed strate-
gies and tactics. A textbook memetic operation along
these lines was a 2052-2053 covert campaign by Red
Sword agents to discredit a type of sensor unit provided
by the United States to the Peruvian government.
Although the Americans assured the Peruvian military
that the equipment worked properly, Peruvian military
units on the ground began to disregard the data the gear
sent. The so-called “Massacre on Chimborazo,” where a
Peruvian Army company was wiped out in a Red Sword
ambush, was the direct result of units ignoring the 
sensor’s warnings.
MEMETIC OPERATIONS

Defenders of the Faith
A society’s continued development depends
upon the support and trust of its people. But
there are those who seek to do ill to a society
by preying upon and subverting popular sup-
port and trust. In 2100, every nation and
national alliance employs cadres of profes-
sional memetic agents whose sole duty is to
seek out and neutralize threats to the memet-
ic security of the people. Some opponents are
opportunists seeking a quick profit. Others
are innocents unaware of the harmful poten-
tial of their new InVid, book, or advertise-
ment. Yet others are terrorists with ample
knowledge and resources devoted to the
destruction of society. Defenders of a nation’s
memetic security need to counter various
threats in ways that don’t draw attention and
lead to even greater trouble in the future.
Fashionistas
With well over 11 billion sapient beings
in the solar system (mostly on Earth), making
it big as a singer, an artist, an InVideograph-
er, or even a fashion designer takes incredible
effort – but has a huge potential payoff. But
for every slinky star or musical legend, there
are thousands upon thousands who toil end-
lessly looping emotions in memetic sweat-
shops (see p. BD65) or playing classic
tranceabilly tunes in bars to a handful of
asteroid miners. Fame doesn’t just happen –
it takes luck, desire, and, more than ever, a
careful understanding of what people want
and how they want it. And since the public’s
attention is limited, every moment in the
spotlight means someone else has been
pushed into the dark. Struggles between up-
and-coming stars can be brutal, bloody, and
very, very rewarding.
Typhoid-Meme Mary
The most perfectly crafted, devastatingly convinc-
ing meme is useless if it doesn’t spread. No memeticist
relies just on “word of mouth”; if you want to get a
meme out there, you need to make it happen. But there
are few cognitive niches out there without well-estab-
lished memes. Any campaign to spread a new meme
will be met with strong opposition – especially a meme
that has the potential to upset the powers that be.
Groups with the ability to create effective memes, prop-
agate them quickly, and defend them thoroughly will be
highly sought after by both potential customers and
potential opponents.
MEMETIC ENGINEERING
141
USING MEMES WITH
PLAYER CHARACTERS
While a memetics-rich campaign has the
potential for complex stories and challenging
adventures, it also can be a headache for the
GM. The sheer amount of data and ease with
which the player characters can acquire it can be
nearly overwhelming. The GM needs to be able
to provide ready access to information (both
factual and false), the opinions of trusted NPCs
on this body of knowledge, and alternative 
scenarios floating around the infosphere.
The adventurers will have access to nearly
limitless amounts of information – so knowing
how to find what they’re looking for will be the
hard part. Characters without high levels in the
Research skill may be lost, especially in a
memetics-oriented campaign, and at the very
least AI allies should be built including this
skill. The various Knowledge, Professional, and
Scientific skills can often further identify rele-
vant data or memes, as can specialized skills
like Conspiracy Theory and Savoir-Faire. Let
the players guide the direction of the research;
as most adventurers will have worn or implant-
ed computers with constant network connec-
tions, they can continue to look for information
even while engaged in combat or other more
physical pursuits. 
While PC memeticists may be always look-
ing for opportunities to spin new memes, they
may be less on the lookout for memes designed
to spin them. But the use of NPC-designed
memes on hapless adventurers can pose a prob-
lem for the GM. Especially given the diverse
backgrounds possible for characters in
Transhuman Space, simply assuming
that everyone knows, believes, or is
familiar with the same set of memes is
unwarranted. One option is to get into the
habit of telling each player that their char-
acters have different reactions to various
memes or facts that they encounter during the cam-
paign: “you know this is true/false;” “you believe this
is true/false;” “you’ve heard this is true/false.” Both
passed notes and a vocal reminder can work.
Once this is habitual, when the adventurers
encounter constructed memes to which they each
have differing reactions, the variety of responses will
be familiar to the players, and not a tip-off that
they’ve just been fed a potentially deceptive meme.
