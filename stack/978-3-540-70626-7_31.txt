Coherent States
Peter W. Milonni and Michael Martin Nieto
Coherent states (of the harmonic oscillator) were introduced by Erwin Schr¨odinger
(1887-1961)at the very beginning of quantum mechanics in response to a complaint
by Lorentz that Schr¨odinger’s  wave function did not display classical motion.
Schr¨odinger obtained solutions that were Gaussians having the width of the ground
state. The expectation values of the coordinate and momentum for these Gaussian
solutions oscillate in time in just the same way as the coordinate and momentum in
the classical theory of the harmonic oscillator.
In modern parlance Schr¨odinger’s solutions are the 2-parameter (⟨x⟩, ⟨p⟩) states

and having “widths” equal to those of the ground state, (

2x) ≡(ℏ/mω)1/2.1
These can be called minimum uncertainty coherent states.
In the 1960s there was a reawakening of interest in these states in terms of the bo-
son operator formalism. Two other, equivalent formulations of coherent states were
obtained. The ﬁrst yields the annihilation operator coherent states, |α⟩, deﬁned by
a|α⟩= α|α⟩,
(3)
where a (a†) is the annihilation (creation) operator ( creation and annihilation
operator). The second yields the displacement operator coherent states
|α⟩≡D(α)|0⟩= exp[αa† −α∗a]|0⟩.

The real and imaginary parts of the complex number α are the two parameters which

They are a 3-parameter set of Gaussians whose widths are not that of the ground state.

where |n⟩are the number states, i.e., the energy eigenstates of the harmonic oscil-
lator. From the Hermite polynomial generating function these can be shown to be

These ideas have been applied to non-harmonic systems, involving different
symmetries and/or potentials. There the coherence properties are not as strong in
general, since it is the equally-spaced levels of the harmonic oscillator which allow
the system never to decohere if there is no damping or excitation.
An especially interesting system is described by the even- and odd-coherent
states (“cat” states). They are higher-power states, eigenvalues of aa. They are given

The  wave packet of these states are two Gaussians, at positions π apart in
the phase-space circle. The Gaussians keep their shapes as they move as a normal
coherent state would in time evolution, until they overlap. When the even states,
composed of n = 0, 2, 4, . . . number states. interfere, they have a maximum central
peak. (See the left graph in Fig. 1.) The odd states are composed of n = 1, 3, 5, . . .

number states. When the odd Gaussians interfere there is a central minimum and
two slightly smaller peaks on each side. (See the right graph in Fig. 1.)
These states have been observed experimentally (Monroe et al.).
The coherent states have been especially useful in quantum optics. Each mode
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld may be described formally as a harmonic oscillator,
and different quantum states of the oscillator correspond to different states of the
ﬁeld. The ﬁeld from a single-mode laser operating far enough above threshold can
be described for many purposes as a coherent state; it differs from a coherent state
in that its phase drifts randomly. But its photon counting statistics and other prop-
erties make the light from a single-mode laser practically indistinguishable from a
coherent state.
The quantum theory of optical coherence is based on “normally ordered” prod-
ucts of lowering and raising operators a and a† which act, respectively, as photon
annihilation and creation operators. The fact that coherent states are eigenstates of
lowering operators implies that the expectation value of a normally ordered ﬁeld op-
erator product f (a, a†) reduces to the deterministic functionf(α, α∗) for a coherent
state. A coherent state of the ﬁeld therefore comes closest to the idealized classical
stable wave in which there are no random ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. Thus a coherent-state
ﬁeld exhibits maximal fringe visibility or “coherence” in a Michelson interfero-
meter, for instance, and it is maximally coherent as well when more complicated
interference effects involving higher orders of ﬁeld products are considered.
