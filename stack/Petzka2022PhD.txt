Abstract 
 
How are transient memories transformed into lasting ones? While previous research has 
established the significance of sleep for consolidating memories, the intricate brain 
mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent memory consolidation are yet to be explored. 
This thesis investigates the mechanistic role of two cardinal brain oscillations during 
sleep, sleep spindles and slow oscillations, for consolidating associative memories.  
In a first study, a new memory paradigm operationalising multiple aspects of memories, 
precisely temporal and spatial features, is introduced. The results indicate that the 
paradigm indeed captures memory aspects that are consolidated during sleep. By 
combining this paradigm with electrophysiological brain recordings, a second study 
demonstrates that sleep spindles are most pronounced over learning-related cortical areas. 
The extent to which spindles track these learning-related cortical areas predicts 
behavioural measures of memory consolidation. Thereby, the second study provides 
evidence supporting a mechanistic function of sleep spindles for memory consolidation. 
That is, sleep spindles specifically occur in encoding relevant cortical areas to facilitate 
consolidation, presumably by inducing long-lasting changes (plasticity) in these areas.  
In a third and fourth study, the interplay between the two cardinal sleep oscillations (sleep 
spindles and slow oscillations) and memory reactivation is investigated. Besides inducing 
plasticity, memory reactivation has been suggested as a potential mechanism underlying 
sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In the third study, we tested for a synchronisation 
of sequential memory reactivation by slow oscillations. To this end, we employed a 
sequential memory paradigm together with novel analysis techniques enabling the 
tracking of sequential memory reactivation. Results represent first evidence of sequential 

 
memory reactivation in humans and support the hypothesis that reactivation of sequential 
memories is synchronised by slow oscillations. Applying the same analysis techniques in 
a fourth study together with an associative memory paradigm, the importance of slow 
oscillation and sleep spindle coupling for memory reactivation has been tested. Results 
of study four reveal memory reactivation during slow oscillation-sleep spindle complexes 
and moreover, that the temporal precision of slow oscillation-sleep spindle coupling 
predicts memory reactivation strength. Study three and four corroborate a timing function 
of cardinal sleep oscillations in service of memory consolidation, suggesting the temporal 
coordination of memory reactivation as a potential mechanistic function of slow 
oscillations and slow oscillation-sleep spindle complexes.  
The final chapter provides a contextualised overview of the work and discusses the 
interplay between brain oscillations during sleep and the proposed mechanisms, induction 
of plasticity and memory reactivation. Together, this thesis provides further insights into 
the mechanisms subserving associative memory consolidation during sleep.

Past events and previous experiences lie at the core of humans’ personality. They 
influence actions and thoughts in the present and future, making the ability to remember 
them as important as experiencing them in the first place. One process enabling us to 
remember these past events is memory consolidation – a process describing the transition 
of newly made experiences into long-term memories (Müller & Pilzecker, 1900). While 
memory consolidation intermittently occurs during wakefulness (Wamsley, 2019), it is 
the period of sleep in which memory consolidation is significantly facilitated (Born & 
Wilhelm, 2012; Klinzing et al., 2019).  
The first evidence for superior memory performance, i.e. less forgetting, following sleep 
compared to wake was demonstrated at the end of the 19th century (Ebbinghaus, 1885). 
In a series of studies, Ebbinghaus (1885) recorded his own memory performance for non-
sense syllables across different time delays. Based on this, he derived forgetting curves, 
describing a non-linear decrease in memory performance as a function of time. 
Interestingly, forgetting was less pronounced when time was spent asleep rather than 
awake. The finding that forgetting is reduced across a retention interval filled with sleep 
has then been replicated with larger sample sizes many times (Heine, 1914; reviewed in 
Rasch & Born, 2013; Jenkins & Dallenbach, 1924).  
These early findings have ignited a debate about why sleep compared to wake results in 
less forgetting, putting forth three different accounts. First, the decay theory has argued 
that forgetting is the consequence of a decline of neurobiological memory traces over 
time ( Thorndike, 1913; reviewed in Rasch & Born, 2013). To then explain the differences 
in forgetting rates between sleep and wake, it was later argued that the decline happens 
at a slower rate during sleep. As the overall metabolism is slower during sleep, 
assumingly all neurobiological processes, including the decay of neurobiological memory 

 
3 
traces, slow down and result in less forgetting over a time interval filled with sleep 
compared to wakefulness (Ekstrand et al., 1977; Wixted, 2004). Second, the interference 
theory has explained forgetting as a consequence of learning new information which then 
retroactively interferes with old information, with negative effects on the ability to 
retrieve them.  While new, interfering information is constantly processed and learned 
during wakefulness, no processing and learning of new, interfering information occurs 
during sleep leading to less forgetting (McGeoch, 1932). Both the decay as well as the 
interference theory have described sleep as a shelter which passively protects and merely 
postpones deterioration of newly formed memories due to decay or interference (Ekstrand 
et al., 1977). The third account (memory consolidation), however, has assigned a more 
active role to sleep. It postulated the occurrence of a physiological process during sleep 
which transforms newly formed memory traces from a labile into a stable, long lasting 
state (Born & Wilhelm, 2012; Ekstrand et al., 1977; Müller & Pilzecker, 1900).  
Throughout the last century, empirical evidence has substantiated the memory 
consolidation account (Antony et al., 2019; Belal et al., 2018; Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 
2018; Ji & Wilson, 2007; Rasch et al., 2007; Rudoy et al., 2009; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015; 
Skaggs & McNaughton, 1996; Wilson & McNaughton, 1994; Zhang et al., 2018), which 
also builds the theoretical framework of this thesis. Although it is widely accepted today 
that physiological processes explain the beneficial effects of sleep for memory, it is still 
elusive which and how memories are actually consolidated during sleep. In this thesis 
both questions are addressed. The first experimental chapter is a behavioural study 
focusing on the quality of memories being consolidated (which). The second, third and 
fourth experimental chapters describe studies in which brain data were recorded during 

 
4 
both wake and sleep. Together, these three chapters bundle empirical evidence for two 
main mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent memory consolidation (how).  
This introduction offers an (non-exhaustive) overview of the current state of research 
targeting these two questions. Since the main body of the thesis primarily focuses on the 
mechanisms of sleep-dependent memory consolidation (chapter 3, 4 and 5) and only one 
study addressed the quality of memories being consolidated (chapter 2), the introduction 
is weighted accordingly.  
1. Which memories are consolidated during sleep? 
The first studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of sleep on consolidation of declarative 
memories (Ebbinghaus, 1885; Heine, 1914; Jenkins & Dallenbach, 1924). Declarative 
memory summarises the ability to consciously remember facts (semantic memory) and 
events (episodic memory, Tulving, 1972). Declarative memory further enables different 
facts and events to be associated with and set in relation to each other (Squire, 2004). The 
fundamental finding that sleep consolidates declarative memories has been conceptually 
replicated many times with a variety of different declarative memory tasks including 
wordlist and word pair learning (Abel et al., 2019; Bäuml et al., 2014; Denis, Schapiro, 
Poskanzer, Bursal, Charon, et al., 2020; Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007; Ellenbogen, 
Payne, et al., 2006; Plihal & Born, 1999; Schönauer et al., 2015), object-location/scene 
associations (Antony & Paller, 2018; Creery et al., 2015; Diekelmann et al., 2011, 2012; 
Noack et al., 2021; Talamini et al., 2008; van Dongen et al., 2012) and vocabulary 

 
5 
learning (Batterink et al., 2017; Henderson et al., 2012; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015).1 
However, most of these studies applied tasks operationalising either semantic memories 
(Abel et al., 2019; Bäuml et al., 2014; Henderson et al., 2012; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015) 
or some aspects of episodic memories, i.e. memory for temporal sequences (Drosopoulos, 
Windau, et al., 2007; Griessenberger et al., 2012; Wilhelm, Wagner, et al., 2011) or 
memory for spatial locations (Antony & Paller, 2018; Creery et al., 2015; Diekelmann et 
al., 2011, 2012; Noack et al., 2021; Talamini et al., 2008; van Dongen et al., 2012). 
Episodic memory, though, constitutes both the temporal sequence as well as the spatial 
location of elements (Tulving, 2002). To enable a simultaneous operationalisation of 
memory for temporal sequences and spatial locations, a new memory paradigm was 
developed and tested in chapter 2 and 3 (but see Rauchs et al., 2004; Weber, Wang, Born, 
& Inostroza, 2014 for other memory paradigms operationalising temporal sequences as 
well as spatial locations). Due to methodological reasons, in chapter 4 and 5, a simpler 
declarative memory task was used. Here, associations between stimuli had to be encoded.  
The general benefits of sleep for declarative memories are widely established, yet it is 
still an open discussion whether all declarative memories equally benefit from sleep or 
whether sleep preferentially consolidates some declarative memories over others. This 
discussion has commenced with findings showing that despite memories being stabilised 
across a period of sleep, some are still forgotten (Bäuml et al., 2014; Denis, Schapiro, 
 
1 Sleep-dependent consolidation is not limited to declarative memories and has reported for non-
declarative, e.g. procedural, memories as well (King et al., 2019; Lutz, Wolf, Hübner, Born, & 
Rauss, 2018; Plihal & Born, 1999; Schönauer et al., 2015; for a review on sleep-dependent 
consolidation of motor memories see King, Hoedlmoser, Hirschauer, Dolfen, & Albouy, 2017). 
Nevertheless, as in all experimental chapters of this thesis declarative memory tasks has been 
used, the focus lies on sleep-dependent consolidation of declarative memories.

Poskanzer, Bursal, Charon, et al., 2020; Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007; P. Hu et al., 
2006; Lo et al., 2014; Payne et al., 2012; Rauchs et al., 2011; Saletin et al., 2011; Wilhelm, 
Diekelmann, et al., 2011). According to these findings, not all memories seem to be 
equally consolidated during sleep and a potential selection process determines the fate of 
newly encoded memories. Recent studies argue for a preferred selection of weakly 
encoded memories for sleep-dependent memory consolidation (Denis, Schapiro, 
Poskanzer, Bursal, Charon, et al., 2020; Diekelmann et al., 2010; Drosopoulos, Schulze, 
et al., 2007; Schapiro et al., 2017; Sheth et al., 2012). Specifically, when memories are 
weakly encoded, memory performance after sleep is superior to memory performance 
after wake. When memories are encoded to a stronger extent, though, memory 
performance after sleep and wake are often similar. This observation is interpreted as 
sleep preferentially consolidating weakly encoded memories. The first experimental 
chapter uncovers an often overlooked confound when comparing sleep-dependent 
consolidation between weakly and strongly encoded memories, i.e., retrieval difficulty. 
Here, we first replicate the finding that weakly encoded memories are preferentially 
consolidated during sleep under normal retrieval conditions. Importantly though, we 
further demonstrate that, by manipulating the retrieval difficulty, consolidation is not 
limited to weakly encoded memories and emerges for strongly encoded memories as well. 
These results challenge the notion that primarily weakly encoded memories are 
consolidated and give important insights into the quality of memories being consolidated 
during sleep.

2. How are memories consolidated during sleep? 
2.1. The sleeping brain oscillates 
The sleeping brain oscillates on different time scales. First, across a whole night of sleep, 
sleep stages indicating different brain states alternate in a cyclic manner. In humans, four 
different sleep stages can be differentiated based on polysomnography (PSG), the 
simultaneous 
recordings 
of 
the 
electrophysiological 
signal 
of 
brain 
(electroencephalography, EEG), eyes (electrooculography, EOG) and muscles 
(electromyography, EMG). Sleep stage 1 (N1) constitutes the transition from wake to 
sleep and comprises 3-8% of total sleep time (TST). In that stage, the amplitude of the 
EEG signal becomes lower and the frequency slows down from alpha frequencies (8-13 
Hz), predominant during wake with eyes closed, to theta frequencies (4-7 Hz). Sleep stage 
2 (N2) covers 45-55% of total sleep time and is hallmarked by short oscillatory bursts 
between 9-15 Hz (sleep spindles) and high amplitude slower oscillations (<4 Hz). When 
the amplitude of the EEG signal increases and the overall signal becomes slower (<4 Hz), 
sleep stage 3 (N3) is reached (15-20% of total sleep time). Slow wave activity, the 
combination between delta waves (oscillations between 1-4 Hz) and slow oscillations 
(oscillations of <1 Hz), gives sleep stage 3 its alternative name: slow wave sleep (SWS). 
Even though faster oscillatory bursts (sleep spindles) occur during SWS, slow waves 
dominate. Sleep stage 1 – 3 can be summarised to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) 
sleep due to the lack of rapid eye movements (REM). Rapid eye movements are the 
unique and name-giving characteristic of the 4th sleep stage, REM sleep (20-25% of total 
sleep time). Besides these typical eye movements, REM sleep is characterised by a low 

 
8 
amplitude and faster EEG which resembles the wake EEG signal (Iber et al., 2007; Lee-
Chiong, 2005).  
Second, besides cycling through different sleep stages, the sleeping brain oscillates on a 
shorter time scale between excitation and inhibition of neuronal assemblies. During non-
REM sleep, three oscillations are predominant: sleep spindles, slow oscillations (SOs) 
and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. Sleep spindles are distinct events oscillating at a 
frequency of 9-15 Hz in a waxing and waning shape for 0.5-3 seconds. They are 
subdivided into two different types of spindles: Slow (9-12 Hz) and fast (12-15 Hz) sleep 
spindles. While the functional purpose of slow spindles is still elusive (Rasch & Born, 
2013), fast sleep spindles have been repeatedly associated with memory consolidation 
(Gais et al., 2002; Holz et al., 2012; Mölle et al., 2011; Schabus et al., 2004). Fast sleep 
spindles are generated within a thalamo-cortical loop involving the transmission of bursts 
from the reticular nucleus to thalamo-cortical neurons and their back projection (Steriade 
et al., 1993). Slow oscillations, on the other side, are distributed alternations between 
hyperpolarization (down state) and depolarization (up state) of cortical neurons 
membrane potential. Up and down states fluctuate at a frequency of <1 Hz and lead to 
wide-ranging cortical silence during the down state and elevated cortical firing during the 
up state (Klinzing et al., 2019; Volgushev et al., 2006). While sleep spindles and slow 
oscillations can be recorded with EEG, hippocampal sharp-wave ripples are mainly 
prevalent using intracranial recordings. Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples consist of two 
oscillatory patterns: First, ripples which are high oscillatory bursts at ~80Hz and second, 
slower waves (i.e., sharp waves) below 4 Hz. While sharp-wave ripples comprise both 
oscillatory patterns, they can also occur in isolation (Buzsáki, 2015).  

 
9 
Sleep spindles, slow oscillations as well as ripples have each been associated with 
memory consolidation (Gais et al., 2002; Ngo et al., 2013; Schabus et al., 2004; van de 
Ven et al., 2016), yet theories and empirical findings argue for a synchronisation of the 
three oscillations to subserve memory consolidation (Diekelmann & Born, 2010; Helfrich 
et al., 2018; Klinzing et al., 2019; Mikutta et al., 2019; Muehlroth et al., 2019).  
2.2. Synaptic & systems consolidation 
As described earlier, the memory consolidation account postulates the occurrence of 
physiological processes which transform labile memory traces into stable representations 
(Müller & Pilzecker, 1900). These physiological processes take place locally at synapses 
(synaptic consolidation) as well as more globally across different brain areas (systems 
consolidation, Dudai, 2004).  
Synaptic consolidation describes the activity-dependent remodelling of synapses and 
dendritic spines within neural circuits representing a memory trace. The activity-
dependent remodelling of synapses can be differentiated between long-term potentiation 
(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP defines an increase in the synaptic 
transmission strength as the consequence of increased synaptic activity, whereas LTD 
reflects a decrease in the synaptic transmission strength due to a lack of synaptic activity 
(Bear & Malenka, 1994). Empirical evidence demonstrated a direct relationship between 
sleep spindles and LTP. In vitro, sleep spindle related spike trains have been shown to 
induce LTP in neocortical pyramidal cells (Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005). Sleep spindles 
have been furthermore linked to synaptic plasticity as they coincide with an increase in 
Ca2+ activity (Niethard et al., 2018; Seibt et al., 2017). A postsynaptic increase in Ca2+ 
activity triggers LTP (Neveu & Zucker, 1996) and sets early synaptic consolidation 

 
10 
processes in motion (Sejnowski & Destexhe, 2000). While rodent research suggests that 
sleep spindles, in general, induce synaptic plasticity in cortical neurons, it is still unknown 
whether the induction of synaptic plasticity particularly in learning-related areas is one 
mechanism by which sleep spindles reflect memory consolidation. In chapter 3, we tested 
the prediction that memory consolidation can be explained by sleep spindles being 
specifically expressed over learning-related cortical areas.  
Consolidation not only takes place at the synapse, but also at the systems level. Systems 
consolidation entails a redistribution of memory representations from one brain system, 
the hippocampus, which acts as a temporary storage for newly encoded memory traces, 
to another brain system, the neocortex, where memories are stored for the long-term 
(Marr, 1971). A new episode experienced during wakefulness is initially encoded in both 
brain systems. While different areas of the neocortex host different aspects of an episode, 
for instance, a person in a specific location at a specific time, the hippocampus binds these 
aspects together into a unique memory trace (McClelland et al., 1995). During sleep, the 
memory trace is repeatedly reactivated in both systems. Memory reactivation, the re-
occurrence of a neuronal activity pattern present during encoding, is the pre-requisite of 
consolidation (Rasch & Born, 2007). Due to repeated memory reactivation, the memory 
trace is redistributed from hippocampus to neocortex and transformed from a labile into 
a stable representation (active system consolidation hypothesis, Born & Wilhelm, 2012; 
Diekelmann & Born, 2010; Klinzing et al., 2019).  
The communication between brain areas in general and between the hippocampus and 
neocortex in particular is enabled by oscillations and their interplay (Buzsáki, 1996). 
During sleep, neocortical slow oscillations orchestrate the communication between 
hippocampus and neocortex. The up state of slow oscillations drives the generation of 

 
11 
thalamic spindles which then propagate to the hippocampus to synchronise ripples in their 
troughs. It has been empirically shown that memory reactivation in the hippocampus is 
linked to sharp-wave ripples (van de Ven et al., 2016). This can be interpreted as spindles 
and slow oscillations signalling the hippocampus when to reactivate (Rothschild et al., 
2017). Simultaneously, thalamic spindles also propagate to the neocortex synchronising 
hippocampal and neocortical reactivation and potentially inducing synaptic consolidation 
in encoding related areas (Klinzing et al., 2019).  
Taken together, theories addressing systems consolidation suggest that memory 
reactivation in hippocampal and cortical sites is a fundamental mechanism of memory 
consolidation and further, that sleep oscillations (slow oscillations, spindles and ripples) 
synchronise memory reactivation within and across brain areas. Empirical evidence 
supporting these theories comes from animal as well as human research.   
Animal research provided the first empirical evidence for memory reactivation in the 
hippocampus and neocortex. In a seminal paper, hippocampal cell activity was recorded 
during encoding and pre- and post-encoding sleep (Wilson & McNaughton, 1994). 
Intriguingly, hippocampal cells that were active while encoded a spatial content were re-
activated during post-encoding sleep. Since the hippocampal activity pattern was absent 
during pre-encoding sleep, it was concluded that the activity pattern during encoding 
modulated the activity pattern during post-encoding sleep. In humans, indirect evidence 
of memory reactivation was firstly provided by findings demonstrating superior memory 
performance for memories which were auditorily or olfactorily cued during sleep (Rasch 
et al., 2007; Rudoy et al., 2009). For example, during encoding, participants associated 
objects with spatial locations. The presentation of objects at spatial locations was 
additionally accompanied by a semantically related sound (e.g., a cat was accompanied 

 
12 
by a “meow”) resulting in unique object-location-sound associations. During post-
encoding sleep (N2/N3 sleep stages), some of the sounds were played without waking 
participants up. After sleep, participants were tested on their memory for the location of 
each object. Results revealed that memory performance for object-location pairs was 
higher when the associated sounds were presented (cued) during sleep compared to 
object-location pairs for which the sounds were not presented (non-cued) (Rudoy et al., 
2009). Superior memory performance for cued memories can be explained by cued 
memories being reactivated in response to the sounds and therefore consolidated. The 
protocol of presenting sounds which were incorporated in previously encoded memories 
is referred to as targeted memory reactivation (TMR, Rudoy et al., 2009; Schreiner & 
Rasch, 2015). TMR has been extensively explored and is an established tool to increase 
memory consolidation (Cairney, Lindsay, Sobczak, Paller, & Gaskell, 2016; Creery et 
al., 2015; Rasch et al., 2007; Schreiner, Lehmann, & Rasch, 2015; Schreiner & Rasch, 
2015; Wang et al., 2019; for a review see Oudiette & Paller, 2013; for a meta-analysis 
see Hu, Cheng, Chiu, & Paller, 2020).  
However, direct evidence for memory reactivation in humans that goes beyond 
behavioural TMR findings is still scarce (but see Belal et al., 2018; Schönauer et al., 2017; 
Schreiner, Doeller, Jensen, Rasch, & Staudigl, 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). This can be 
explained, at least partly, by a longstanding lack of suitable methods to measure memory 
reactivation in humans. Now, recent developments of novel analysis techniques including 
multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) provide the possibility to capture reactivation of 
memory traces in neuroimaging data (Grootswagers et al., 2017; Norman et al., 2006). 
Chapter 4 and 5 exploit these new methods to provide evidence for endogenous as well 
as induced (via TMR) reactivation. Further, in both chapters, reactivation and its interplay 

 
13 
with sleep oscillations is investigated. The analyses in both chapters share the same 
general approach: MVPA is applied to EEG data obtained during wakefulness and sleep. 
More precisely, a classification algorithm is trained on EEG wake data measured during 
a perception task to find a model that best differentiates between category-specific neural 
patterns (e.g., neural patterns during object vs. scene perception). Importantly, the 
memory task comprises only one of the categories (e.g., encoding of adjective-object 
pairs) which is hypothesised to be reactivated during post-encoding sleep. The model that 
differentiates between category-specific neural patterns (e.g., neural patterns during 
object vs. scene perception) is then tested on sleep data in such a way that above chance 
classification reflects neural activity during sleep which resembles one category-specific 
neural pattern more than the specific pattern of a different category. Evidence for 
reactivation is assumed if above-chance classification of the stimulus category that was 
encoded before sleep is observed during sleep.   
3. Aims of this thesis 
The aims of this thesis are twofold. First, the thesis investigates which memories are 
consolidated during sleep (chapter 2). According to recent studies, sleep-dependent 
consolidation processes favour different types of memories to a different extent. More 
precisely, weaker memories might benefit more from post-learning sleep than stronger 
memories. In chapter 2 we test the hypothesis that sleep-dependent benefits for weaker 
over stronger memories might be the consequence of how memories are tested in the 
experimental task design (i.e., which testing conditions are applied). That is, under 
standard testing conditions, sleep-dependent consolidation effects for stronger memories 

 
14 
might be obscured by ceiling effects. To test this hypothesis, we developed a new memory 
paradigm and systematically manipulated memory strength as well as the testing 
conditions (to push stronger memories away from ceiling). The results of chapter 2 have 
implications for future testing protocols and further the understanding of which memories 
are consolidated during sleep.  
The second aim of this thesis is to investigate the mechanistic role of two cardinal brain 
oscillations during sleep, sleep spindles and slow oscillations, for consolidating 
associative memories. While both sleep oscillations have been associated with memory 
consolidation, the underlying mechanisms are often theoretically outlined but empirical 
evidence is scarce. In chapter 3, the same paradigm of chapter 2 in combination with 
electrophysiological brain recordings is used to investigate the mechanistic function of 
sleep spindles. While rodent research suggests that sleep spindles, in general, correlate 
with synaptic plasticity in cortical neurons (Niethard et al., 2021; Rosanova & Ulrich, 
2005; Seibt et al., 2017), it is still unclear whether the induction of plasticity particularly 
in learning-related areas is one mechanism by which sleep spindles reflect memory 
consolidation. By testing the hypothesis that memory consolidation can be explained by 
an overlap between encoding and sleep spindle topographies (i.e., reflecting the tracking 
of learning-related areas by sleep spindles), chapter 3 provides important insights into 
potential underlying mechanisms of how sleep spindles subserve consolidation.  
In chapter 4 and 5, electrophysiological brain recordings are combined with multivariate 
pattern analysis to test the hypothesis that sleep oscillations orchestrate the reactivation 
of newly encoded memories during post-encoding sleep. While memory reactivation has 
been demonstrated before (Belal et al., 2018; Schönauer et al., 2017; Schreiner et al., 
2018; Zhang et al., 2018), it is still unknown (i) how memory reactivation of sequential 

 
15 
memories evolves over time and (ii) how memory reactivation interplays with sleep 
oscillations, specifically with sleep spindles, slow oscillations and sleep spindles that are 
coupled to slow oscillations. Both points are addressed in chapter 4 and 5, respectively 
which makes those chapters to an important building block in identifying memory 
reactivation in humans and in understanding its synchronisation by sleep oscillations.

Abstract 
Sleep stabilizes newly acquired memories, a process referred to as memory consolidation. 
According to recent studies, sleep-dependent consolidation processes might be deployed 
to different extents for different types of memories. In particular, weaker memories might 
benefit more from post-learning sleep than stronger memories. However, under standard 
testing conditions, sleep-dependent consolidation effects for stronger memories might be 
obscured by ceiling effects. To test this possibility, we devised a new memory paradigm 
(Memory Arena) in which participants learned temporospatial arrangements of objects. 
Prior to a delay period spent either awake or asleep, training thresholds were controlled 
to yield weak or strong memory opportunities. After the delay period, retrieval difficulty 
was controlled via the presence or absence of a retroactive interference task. Under 
standard testing conditions (no interference), a sleep-dependent consolidation effect was 
indeed observed for weaker memory opportunities only. Critically though, with increased 
retrieval demands, sleep-dependent consolidation effects were seen for both weaker and 
stronger memory opportunities. These results suggest that all memories are consolidated 
during sleep, but that memories of different strengths require different testing conditions 
to unveil their benefit from post-learning sleep.

1. Introduction 
How do fleeting experiences become long-term memories? Research has established the 
importance of post-learning sleep for the strengthening of recently acquired memories, a 
process referred to as memory consolidation (Diekelmann & Born, 2010; Jenkins & 
Dallenbach, 1924; Müller & Pilzecker, 1900; Rasch & Born, 2013). However, the 
principles governing sleep-dependent consolidation, i.e., superior memory retention after 
sleep compared to wake, are still poorly understood. Does post-learning sleep benefit all 
memories equally, or are particular types of memories prioritized for consolidation 
processes? Consistent with the latter scenario, evidence has accumulated in recent years 
for a somewhat selective sleep-dependent consolidation process.  
On the one hand, a greater benefit from post-learning sleep has been shown for 
emotionally salient compared to neutral stimuli (P. Hu et al., 2006), for events with high 
compared to low future relevance (Wilhelm et al., 2011) and for items intended to be later 
remembered compared to items intended to be forgotten (Rauchs et al., 2011; Saletin et 
al., 2011). To the extent that emotional salience, high future relevance and the intention 
to remember entail deeper processing during encoding (Craik & Lockhart, 1972), these 
results suggest that sleep-dependent consolidation may prioritise stronger memories. 
Differential post-sleep memory outcomes might then result from a synaptic 
downregulation process during sleep through which weaker memories are pruned but 
stronger memories are preserved (Tononi & Cirelli, 2006).  
On the other hand, there is evidence supporting the notion that sleep-dependent 
consolidation favours weaker memories. For instance, Bäuml, Holterman and Abel 
(2014) compared sleep-dependent consolidation of items that were restudied with items 

 
19 
that were retrieved during a practice period. As retrieval practice usually results in 
stronger memories than restudy ('testing effect', Roediger & Butler, 2011), their finding 
of restudied (i.e., weaker) and not retrieved (i.e., stronger) items showing a sleep-
dependent consolidation effect suggests that weaker memories differentially benefit from 
sleep-dependent consolidation. Two other studies, also indirectly manipulating memory 
strength, came to the same conclusion. They have shown greater sleep-dependent 
consolidation effects for word pairs with low compared to high semantic relatedness (Lo 
et al., 2014; Payne et al., 2012), where low semantic relatedness typically yields weaker 
memories. Moreover, experimentally facilitating consolidation during sleep via targeted 
memory reactivation (Rasch, Büchel, Gais, & Born, 2007; Rudoy, Voss, Westerberg, & 
Paller, 2009; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015) has been demonstrated to be more effective for 
items less well remembered prior to sleep (i.e., weaker memories) (Cairney et al., 2016; 
Creery et al., 2015). Finally, one study directly manipulated pre-sleep memory strength, 
either by having participants learn some stimuli to a lower criterion than others, or by 
imposing a retroactive interference task immediately after learning. Again, results 
indicate greater sleep-dependent consolidation benefits for weaker than for stronger 
memories (Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007).  
How can these different lines of results be reconciled? One possible explanation for the 
result of weaker memories being preferentially consolidated during sleep is a ceiling 
effect for stronger memories. That is, elevating the strength of pre-sleep memory traces 
beyond a certain threshold might conceal the retention benefit typically afforded by sleep. 
In other words, sleep possibly benefits both weaker and stronger memories, but different 
testing protocols (mitigating ceiling effects) are needed to uncover these benefits. One 
effective means to reduce the impact of ceiling effects is to retroactively weaken memory 

 
20 
traces through interference, thereby moving them away from ceiling. For instance, one 
study had participants learn word pairs to a 100% accuracy criterion (corresponding to 
rather strong pre-sleep memories) and applied retroactive interference immediately 
before the final (post-sleep) retrieval session (Ellenbogen, Hulbert, et al., 2006). This 
procedure indeed revealed a sleep-dependent consolidation effect, despite the initially 
high learning criterion. Critically though, that study did not vary pre-sleep memory 
strength, such that it is unclear whether sleep protects both weaker and stronger memories 
from retroactive interference. 
In light of the extant findings, we hypothesised that both weaker and stronger memories 
might benefit from post-learning sleep, but that an increase in retrieval difficulty is needed 
to uncover sleep-dependent consolidation of stronger memories. To assess the beneficial 
effect of sleep-dependent consolidation on weaker and stronger memories as a function 
of retrieval difficulty within the same paradigm, we systematically manipulated (i) pre-
sleep memory strength by varying a training threshold (providing weaker vs. stronger 
memory opportunities) and (ii) retrieval difficulty by inducing retroactive interference. 
To this end, we devised a new memory paradigm (‘Memory Arena’), designed to capture 
de-novo learning of temporal and spatial aspects of episodic memory. Specifically, the 
Memory Arena paradigm has participants learn both the temporal and spatial position of 
20 individual object images placed on a circle. Learning is in principle completed when 
all 20 objects are placed in the correct temporal order to their correct position (100% 
performance). Importantly though, memory strength can be experimentally controlled by 
terminating training at different performance levels. Retroactive interference was induced 
by having participants learn a new temporospatial arrangement of the same objects 
directly before the final retrieval.  

 
21 
Our first aim was to replicate the greater benefit of sleep-dependent consolidation for 
weaker relative to stronger memory opportunities (using a standard testing protocol 
without retroactive interference). Indeed, we found that weaker memory opportunities 
(training threshold of 1x50% accuracy) showed a sleep-dependent consolidation effect, 
whereas stronger memory opportunities (training threshold of 2x70% accuracy) did not. 
We then tested whether increased retrieval demands, i.e., the need to overcome retroactive 
interference, would yield a sleep-dependent consolidation effect for stronger memory 
opportunities as well. Intriguingly, this manipulation revealed sleep-dependent 
consolidation effects for both types of pre-sleep memories (weaker and stronger). These 
results suggest that post-learning sleep might benefit all memories, but that different 
testing conditions are differentially sensitive to unveiling consolidation of weaker vs. 
stronger memories.  
2. Results 
2.1. 
General 
To capture both the temporal and spatial components of episodic memory we designed a 
new paradigm, called Memory Arena (see Figure 1 for the task design). 

 
22 
 
Figure 2.1. Task design. During encoding 20 objects were presented in the Memory 
Arena. After clicking on an object, the current object disappeared and the next object was 
shown. The training session started with all 20 objects randomly arranged around the 
arena. Objects had to be dragged and dropped in the correct sequence to the correct spatial 
position. Feedback was given after each trial and any errors were corrected. Interference 
was induced by encoding of the same objects but in a different sequence and at different 
spatial positions. Retrieval (not shown) followed the same procedure as training, but no 
feedback and correction were provided. 
Our study design included the between-subjects factors Delay (sleep vs. wake), Memory 
Strength (weaker vs. stronger) and Retrieval Difficulty (no interference vs. interference) 
resulting in 8 conditions with 15 participants each (Figure 2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
23 
Figure 2.2. Study design. 120 participants were randomly assigned to one of 8 conditions 
(groups). All sleep groups performed the encoding, training and pre-delay retrieval in the 
evening and the post-delay retrieval 12 hours later in the morning. The wake groups 
performed the encoding, training and pre-delay retrieval in the morning and the post-
delay retrieval 12 hours later in the evening. Besides the between-subjects factor Delay 
(sleep vs. wake), pre-sleep memory strength was manipulated via the training threshold 
(A and C for weaker memory opportunities and B and D for stronger memory 
opportunities). Additionally, half of the participants were given an interference task 
before the post-delay retrieval to increase retrieval difficulty (between-subjects factor 
Retrieval Difficulty, A and B for no interference, C and D for interference). E = encoding, 
T = training, pvt = Psychomotor Vigilance Task, R1 = pre-delay retrieval, R2 = post-
delay retrieval, i = interference  
First, we assessed whether the encoding strength manipulation (1x50% vs. 2x70% 
training performance) affected the training duration, quantified both in terms of training 
rounds required and total time spent to reach criterion, including the encoding part (see 
Supplemental Information, Table S1 for descriptive data). We conducted a 2x2x2 

 
24 
ANOVA with the between-subjects factors Delay, Memory Strength and Retrieval 
Difficulty and the training duration or the total number of training rounds as dependent 
variables. For strong memories (2x70% criterion), participants required significantly 
longer training time (main effect of Memory Strength: F(1, 112) = 8.05, p = .005, ηp2= 
0.07, mean2x70% = 1128.13 sec, 95%CI2x70% = 92.24 sec, mean1x50% = 909.85 sec, 
95%CI1x50% = 120.61 sec) and more training rounds (main effect of Memory Strength: 
F(1, 112) = 15.58, p < .001, ηp2= 0.12, mean2x70% = 4.88, 95%CI2x70% = 0.49, mean1x50% = 
3.22, 95%CI1x50% = 0.67). The time of the day for training (evening for all sleep groups 
and morning for all wake groups) neither impacted training duration (main effect of 
Delay: F(1, 112) = 0.03, p = .869, ηp2< 0.01, BF01 = 5.08) nor the number of training 
rounds needed to reach the criterion (main effect of Delay: F(1, 112) = 1.40, p = .239, 
ηp2= 0.01, BF01 = 2.89). Likewise, there was no significant difference in training duration 
and number of training rounds between no interference and interference groups (duration: 
main effect of Retrieval Difficulty: F(1, 112) = 0.02, p = .884, ηp2< 0.01, BF01 = 5.10; 
rounds: main effect of Retrieval Difficulty: F(1, 112) = 0.01, p = .937, ηp2< 0.01, BF01 = 
5.13). 
Next, we identified one performance metric for all subsequent analyses. The Memory 
Arena paradigm yields two separate measures for memory performance, i.e., sequence 
memory and spatial memory. This allowed us to proceed with the memory measure most 
sensitive to our critical encoding strength manipulation (1x50% vs. 2x70%, pre-delay 
Memory Strength). At the same time, we wanted to ensure that pre-delay memory 
performance did not differ between sleep and wake groups (factor Delay) or between no 
interference and interference groups (factor Retrieval Difficulty). We thus compared 
sequence performance as well as spatial error at pre-delay retrieval in two separate 2x2x2 

 
25 
ANOVAs, each including the between-subjects factors Delay, Memory Strength and 
Retrieval Difficulty. As expected, the 2x70% training threshold led to better pre-delay 
retrieval performance than the 1x50% training threshold for both measures (main effect 
of Memory Strength for sequence performance: F(1, 112) = 73.44, p < .001, ηp2= 0.40; 
main effect of Memory Strength for spatial error: F(1, 112) = 46.80, p < .001, ηp2= 0.29). 
Critically though, the corresponding effect size was markedly higher for sequence (ηp2= 
0.40) than for spatial memory performance (ηp2= 0.29). Consequently, we focused our 
subsequent analyses on sequence performance (but see Supplemental Information, Table 
S2 and Figure S1-S3, for analyses using spatial memory performance and Table S3 and 
Figure S4-S6 for analyses using overall memory performance). Importantly, neither 
Delay (sleep vs. wake) nor Retrieval Difficulty (no interference vs. interference) had a 
significant effect on sequence or spatial memory performance at pre-delay retrieval (all 
F < 1.29, all p > .258, all BF01 > 3.36), ensuring there were no other baseline (pre-delay) 
differences between groups.  
To account for potential differences in attention between pre- and post-delay retrieval, we 
compared the number of attention lapses (reaction times > 500ms, Basner & Dinges, 
2011) during the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). Results showed that there was no 
significant change in the number of lapses in any of the conditions from pre to post-delay 
retrieval (all t < 1.59, all p > .135), ruling out fatigue as a confounding factor for our 
results. 
Consolidation, i.e., the change in sequence memory performance from pre to post-delay 
retrieval, was calculated as a relative change. In the following, sequence consolidation 
denotes the performance during post-delay retrieval relative to pre-delay retrieval, 
meaning that values > 100% reflect an increase, values < 100% reflect a decrease and 

 
26 
values = 100% reflect a stabilization of sequence memory performance. Sleep-dependent 
consolidation is then defined as the differential consolidation effect for the sleep group 
compared to the corresponding wake group (factor Delay).  
As a first analysis we conducted a 2x2x2 ANOVA with sequence consolidation as the 
dependent variable and Delay (sleep vs. wake), Memory Strength (weaker vs. stronger) 
and Retrieval Difficulty (no interference vs. interference) as between-subjects factors. 
Across all groups, post- relative to pre-delay performance was higher in sleep groups than 
in wake groups (main effect for Delay: F(1,112) = 32.69, p < .001, ηp2= 0.23) and lower 
for high retrieval difficulty in comparison to low retrieval difficulty (main effect for 
Retrieval Difficulty: F(1,112) = 44.07, p < .001, ηp2= 0.28). Neither the main effect for 
Memory Strength nor any of the two way interactions reached significance (all F < 2.06 
all p > .154, all BF01 > 2.95). Critically though, we found a significant three way 
interaction (F(1, 112) = 6.21, p = .014, ηp2= 0.05), suggesting that sleep-dependent 
consolidation effects for weaker and stronger memory opportunities might differ as a 
function of retrieval difficulty. We thus conducted two sets of subsidiary ANOVAs: First, 
breaking up the factor Retrieval Difficulty, we conducted separate ANOVAs to test for 
sleep-dependent consolidation effects for weaker vs. stronger memory opportunities 
under standard testing conditions (no interference, see section 2.2.) and with an increase 
in retrieval difficulty (interference, see section 2.3.). Second, breaking up the factor 
Memory Strength, we conducted separate ANOVAs to assess sleep-dependent 
consolidation effects as a function of retrieval difficulty for weaker and stronger memory 
opportunities, respectively (see section 2.4.).  
 

 
27 
2.2. 
No interference: Only weaker memories show a sleep-dependent 
consolidation effect 
To test whether weaker memory opportunities show a greater sleep-dependent 
consolidation effect than stronger memory opportunities under standard testing 
conditions, a 2x2 ANOVA with the between-subjects factors Delay (sleep vs. wake) and 
Memory Strength (weaker vs. stronger) was conducted on sequence consolidation for the 
no interference groups. Overall, sequence consolidation was significantly greater in the 
sleep groups than in the wake groups (main effect of Delay: F(1,56) = 11.59, p = .001, 
ηp2= 0.17). Interestingly though, this sleep-dependent consolidation effect was modulated 
by the initial memory strength (interaction of Delay x Strength: F(1,56) = 5.78, p = .020, 
ηp2= 0.09). Post hoc t-tests revealed that sequence consolidation did not significantly 
differ between the sleep and the wake group for stronger memories (t(20.40) = 1.11, p = 
.28, d = 0.41, BF01 = 1.82). However, for weaker memory opportunities, the sleep group 
showed significantly greater sequence consolidation than the wake group (t(26.63) = 
3.25, p = .003, d = 1.19, Figure 3A). These results are consistent with the notion that 
sleep-dependent consolidation selectively benefits weaker memories.  
As mentioned in the introduction, beneficial effects of sleep for weaker and not for 
stronger memories might result from stronger memories being at ceiling. Indeed, the 
distribution of pre-delay sequence performance for stronger memory opportunities 
significantly deviated from a normal distribution (assessed via Shapiro–Wilk tests) for 
the wake (W = 0.56, p < .001) and the sleep group (W = 0.80, p = .004) and was skewed 
towards high performance values (Figure 3B). Conversely, the distribution of pre-delay 
sequence performance for weaker memory opportunities did not significantly differ from 

 
28 
a normal distribution (wake group: W = 0.95, p = .513, sleep group: W = 0.92, p = .229). 
Under normal testing conditions (in the absence of retroactive interference), post-delay 
sequence performance for stronger memory opportunities was still at ceiling for both the 
wake (W = 0.78, p = .002) and the sleep group (W = 0.85, p = .018), thus likely to obscure 
any benefit of sleep for the consolidation of stronger memory opportunities (see 
Supplemental Information, Table S5 for Shapiro-Wilk tests of all distributions and Table 
S4 for t-tests of pre- vs. post-delay sequence performance).  
 
 
Figure 2.3. Consolidation effects for no interference groups. A. For weaker memory 
opportunities, sequence consolidation (relative performance change from pre- to post-
delay retrieval) is significantly greater in the sleep group (grey, circle) than in the wake 
group (orange, triangle), whereas there is no statistical difference between the sleep and 
wake group for stronger memory opportunities. B. For stronger memory opportunities 
(right column), pre- as well as post-delay sequence performance was at ceiling, while pre-

and post-delay sequence performance for weaker memory opportunities (left column) 
were normally distributed. Only sequence performance for weaker memory opportunities 
in the wake group significantly decreased from pre- to post-delay retrieval. Single 
participant data (grey filled circles for sleep groups and orange filled triangles for wake 
groups), density plots and group means with 95% CIs are shown in A and B. * = p ≤ .05;

2.3. 
Interference: Stronger memories also show a sleep-dependent 
consolidation effect 
As mentioned above, stronger memories may require an increase in retrieval difficulty to 
mitigate possible ceiling effects and to unveil the beneficial effect of post-learning sleep 
for consolidation. To test this hypothesis, we again compared sequence consolidation in 
a 2x2 ANOVA with the between-subjects factors Delay (sleep vs. wake) and Memory 
Strength (weaker vs. stronger), this time focusing on the high retrieval difficulty 
(interference) groups.  
Results demonstrated that sequence consolidation in the sleep groups was again 
significantly higher than in the wake groups (main effect of Delay: F(1,56) = 21.22, p < 
.001, ηp2= 0.28). Importantly though, both weaker and stronger memory opportunities 
showed a significant sleep-dependent consolidation effect (no Delay x Strength 
interaction: F(1,56) = 0.98, p = .327, ηp2= 0.02, BF01 = 2.80). For weaker memory 
opportunities, sequence consolidation was significantly greater in the sleep group than in 
the wake group (t(27.61) = 2.27, p = .031, d = 0.83), which replicated the pattern observed 
with low retrieval difficulty (see above). Critically though and in contrast to the low 
retrieval difficulty conditions, sequence consolidation was also significantly greater in 
the sleep group than in the wake group for stronger memory opportunities (t(27.93) = 

 
30 
4.64, p < .001, d = 1.70, Figure 4A). Indeed, the increase in retrieval difficulty effectively 
eliminated ceiling effects during post-delay retrieval (sleep group: W = 0.96, p = .722, 
wake group: W = 0.98, p = .981, Figure 4B). These findings indicate that both stronger 
and weaker memories benefited from post-learning sleep, but that stronger memories 
required additional retrieval demands to show a benefit from post-learning sleep.

interference, sequence consolidation (relative performance change from pre- to post-
delay retrieval) in the sleep group (grey, circle) is significantly greater for both weaker 
and stronger memory opportunities. B. For stronger memory opportunities (right

performance was normally distributed. For weaker memory opportunities (left column), 
pre- as well as post-delay sequence performance were normally distributed. Sequence 
performance of all memories significantly decreased from pre- to post-delay retrieval.

2.4. 
Sleep-dependent consolidation of stronger memories is modulated by 
retrieval difficulty 
Our previous analyses showed a sleep-dependent consolidation effect for stronger 
memories when retrieval difficulty was increased (interference; see section 2.3.), but not 
under standard testing conditions (no interference; see section 2.2.). To directly test for 
changes in sleep-dependent consolidation effects from low to high retrieval difficulty 
separately for weaker and stronger memory opportunities, two 2x2 ANOVAs with the 
between-subjects factors Delay (sleep vs. wake) and Retrieval Difficulty (no interference 
vs. interference) were performed. For weaker memory opportunities, the increase in 
retrieval difficulty did not affect sleep-dependent consolidation effects (no interaction 
Delay x Retrieval Difficulty: F(1,56) = 0.33, p = .570, ηp2= 0.01, BF01 = 3.45). For 
stronger memory opportunities, we found a significant increase in sleep-dependent 
consolidation effects from low to high retrieval difficulty (interaction of Delay x Retrieval 
Difficulty: F(1,56) = 11.21, p = .001, ηp2= 0.17, Figure 5).

interference, left), the difference in sequence consolidation (relative performance change 
from pre- to post-delay retrieval) between sleep and wake is significant for weaker 
memories only. With an increase in retrieval difficulty (interference, right), sleep-
dependent consolidation effects are seen for both weaker and stronger memory 
opportunities. For stronger memory opportunities, the sleep-dependent consolidation 
effect was significantly greater for high retrieval difficulty (retroactive interference) 
compared to low retrieval difficulty (no interference). Shown are differences in means 
between sleep and wake groups and the corresponding 95% CIs. * = p ≤ .05; n.s. = not

3. Discussion 
The aim of the present study was to assess whether sleep-dependent memory 
consolidation favours weaker over stronger memories. To this end, we devised a novel 
memory paradigm (Memory Arena, Figure 1) and experimentally controlled delay type 
(sleep or wake), pre-delay memory strength (weaker or stronger) and retrieval difficulty 
(no interference or interference) (Figure 2). Under standard retrieval conditions (no 
retroactive interference), our data indeed suggest that weaker memories benefit from 
sleep while stronger memories seem not to (Figure 3). This finding is in agreement with 
a growing body of evidence for sleep-dependent consolidation processes favouring 
weaker memories. Some of these studies used rather indirect manipulations of memory 
strength, e.g. by comparing retrieval vs. restudy (Bäuml et al., 2014), by varying the 
difficulty of motor sequences from low element sequences (resulting in stronger 
procedural memories) to high element sequences (resulting in weaker procedural 
memories, Kuriyama, Stickgold, & Walker, 2013) or by changing the difficulty of a 
problem solving task (Sio et al., 2013). Other studies directly manipulated memory 
strength either by varying the number of presentations (Denis, Schapiro, Poskanzer, 
Bursal, Charron, et al., 2020; Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007; Schapiro et al., 2017; 
Sheth et al., 2012), by inducing retroactive interference immediately after encoding to 
weaken memories (Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007; McDevitt et al., 2015) or by 
comparing participants with high vs. low pre-sleep memory performance (Diekelmann et 
al., 2010; Djonlagic et al., 2009).  
One factor potentially accounting for diminished sleep-dependent consolidation effects 
for stronger memories is that memory strength is often manipulated by repeated encoding 

 
34 
and retrieval of the study material (Denis, Schapiro, Poskanzer, Bursal, Charron, et al., 
2020; Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007; Schapiro et al., 2017; Sheth et al., 2012). That 
is, it has been argued that online retrieval emulates a consolidation process similar to that 
occurring during sleep (Antony et al., 2017). Consequently, stronger memories might 
already be sufficiently consolidated before sleep, yielding less need for further 
consolidation during sleep. Convergent evidence for this notion comes from studies 
examining post-learning sleep spindle activity, with spindles being considered a key 
mechanistic vehicle of memory consolidation (Fernandez & Lüthi, 2020b; Peyrache & 
Seibt, 2020). In particular, an increase in spindle power during a post-learning nap has 
been reported after a high difficulty learning task (producing weaker memories) but not 
after a low difficulty learning task (producing stronger memories) (Schmidt et al., 2006). 
Likewise, spindle density has been linked to consolidation specifically of weaker 
memories (Denis, Mylonas, et al., 2020). Two other nap studies used targeted memory 
reactivation (TMR) to experimentally bolster consolidation. Interestingly, TMR resulted 
in better post-sleep memory performance only for weakly encoded memories (Cairney et 
al., 2016; Creery et al., 2015). Collectively, these findings suggest that sleep-dependent 
consolidation processes are preferentially deployed for weaker compared to stronger 
memories. 
However, one alternative explanation – at least for the behavioural effects described 
above – is that beneficial effects of sleep for stronger memories are obscured by ceiling 
effects. In the present study, we demonstrate that under normal retrieval conditions 
(without interference), ceiling effects for stronger memories during pre-delay retrieval 
still persist during post-delay retrieval and would thereby conceal possible sleep-
dependent consolidation effects. One way to eliminate ceiling effects during post-delay 

 
35 
retrieval is to induce retroactive interference directly before retrieval. This approach has 
been taken in a series of studies explicitly testing the protective effect of sleep against 
retroactive interference. Indeed, despite training participants to 100% pre-delay memory 
accuracy, the introduction of retroactive interference after the delay and before the final 
retrieval revealed a beneficial effect of sleep over wake, i.e. a sleep-dependent 
consolidation effect (Ellenbogen, Hulbert, Jiang, & Stickgold, 2009; Ellenbogen et al., 
2006; but see Bailes, Caldwell, Wamsley, & Tucker, 2020; Pöhlchen, Pawlizki, Gais, & 
Schönauer, 2020). In line with these studies, we used retroactive interference to increase 
retrieval difficulty and thereby push memory performance from ceiling. Critically, this 
manipulation revealed sleep-dependent consolidation effects for weaker as well as for 
stronger memories (Figure 4). One interesting question for future research is whether this 
‘rescue’ of sleep-dependent consolidation effects for strong memories relies on 
interference manipulations, or whether other means of increasing retrieval demands, e.g., 
dual task manipulations, produce similar effects. 
Our current results thus suggest that post-learning sleep benefits all memories, but that 
greater levels of initial memory strength call for adjusted testing protocols. It is interesting 
to note that weaker memories benefitted from sleep irrespective of subsequent retrieval 
demands, at least with respect to the presence vs. absence of retroactive interference as 
employed here. That said, an important goal for future research is to establish the lower 
memory strength boundaries for sleep-dependent consolidation effects to occur. In 
particular, if initial memory strength is too low, a floor effect would likely hinder any 
benefit from subsequent sleep. 

 
36 
It deserves mention that besides retrieval difficulty, a number of other factors appear to 
impact sleep-dependent consolidation. One such factor is the duration of sleep. While 
some studies used 2h daytime naps as a delay period (Cairney et al., 2016; Creery et al., 
2015; Denis, Mylonas, et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2006), others followed a whole-night 
protocol (Bäuml et al., 2014; Diekelmann et al., 2010; Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007). 
Importantly, Schapiro et al. (2017) demonstrated that a full night of sleep and a nap show 
differential selectivity for weaker or stronger memories. In line with other nap studies 
(Cairney et al., 2016; Creery et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2006), they found that a 2h nap 
selectively benefitted weaker memories. However, the selective benefit for weaker 
memories diminished after a full night of sleep. A possible interpretation of these results 
is that weaker memories are reactivated earlier during sleep, i.e., are prioritized as they 
are more prone to forgetting. A full night of sleep, however, provides sufficient time to 
reactivate both weaker and stronger memories. While tempting, this interpretation 
requires additional research systematically controlling nap vs. full night of sleep and 
weaker vs. stronger memories. Another factor to be considered is the particular definition 
of weaker and stronger memories. For example, Tucker and Fishbein (2008) used a 
similar retrieval vs. restudy manipulation as Bäuml et al. (2014) but came to different 
conclusions. They found a sleep-dependent consolidation effect for items subjected to 
retrieval practice (thought to result in stronger memories, see introduction), but not for 
items restudied (thought to result in weaker memories), which is the exact opposite 
pattern as in Bäuml et al. (2014). However, in their retrieval practice condition, Bäuml et 
al. (2014) had participants retrieve fewer items more frequently compared to Tucker and 
Fishbein (2008), likely to result in stronger memories. This illustrates the difficulty of 
categorically designating a particular memory as weak or strong based on behavioural 

 
37 
assays alone. Real-time brain imaging might be used as a complementary measure to 
assess post-learning memory strength (Ezzyat et al., 2018).  
4. Methods 
4.1. 
Participants 
Overall, 128 participants took part in the study. Eight participants were excluded – 6 
participants based on Actigraph recordings (5 participants in a sleep group slept less than 
5 hours between pre- and post-retrieval and 1 participant in a wake group slept during the 
day), 1 participant did not finish the experiment and 1 participant was erroneously 
assigned to the wrong condition. The remaining 120 participants were included in the 
analyses (age = 20.58 ± 2.08 [mean ± SD], female = 83, n = 15 per group). Target sample 
size was based on two relevant studies using between-subjects designs. Drosopoulos et 
al. (2007) used 10 participants per group to demonstrate a greater sleep-dependent 
consolidation effect for weaker than for stronger memories. Ellenbogen et al. (2006) used 
12 participants per group to show that sleep-dependent consolidation effects are impacted 
by retrieval demands. 
Participants had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders and had a normal 
sleep-wake cycle as assessed with a sleep diary. For taking part in the study, participants 
received either monetary reimbursement or study credits. The study was approved by the 
University of Birmingham Research Ethics and Governance Committee and written 
informed consent was obtained from participants before the start of the experiment.  

 
38 
4.2. 
Task design & procedure 
To capture both the temporal and spatial components of episodic memory we designed a 
new paradigm, called Memory Arena. It consists of a circle divided into four quarters, 
each depicting a different scene background (upper left: arctic landscape, upper right: 
desert, lower right: autumn forest, lower left: sea, Figure 1). On top of these backgrounds, 
individual objects are presented in different spatial positions. Participants have to learn 
the temporal (sequential) and spatial position of each object.  
Twenty target objects were randomly selected from a pool of 50 common animate and 
inanimate objects (Konkle, Brady, Alvarez, & Oliva, 2010, coloured and presented on a 
white 90x90 pixels square). The spatial position of each object was restricted by the 
outline of the Memory Arena and by the position of other objects. Thus, there was no 
overlap between objects but it was possible that an object covered multiple background 
scenes.  
During the encoding part of the Memory Arena, all 20 objects were presented one after 
another and participants confirmed an object’s spatial position by clicking on the object. 
The current object then disappeared and the next object was presented (Figure 1). 
Participants were encouraged to associate the objects with each other and with the 
background scenes into a narrative. 
A training session was introduced directly after the encoding part. The training started 
with all 20 objects randomly arranged around the arena. Participants had to drag and drop 
the objects in the correct sequence to the correct spatial position. If an error was made 
regarding the sequence or spatial position, the arena turned red and the error was 
corrected. If the object was placed at its correct sequential and spatial position, the arena 

 
39 
turned green. The sequence position was scored as correct if object i was placed at the ith 
position. The spatial position of an object was scored as correct if the overlap between its 
position and the correct position was higher than 25%.  
After feedback and potential error correction, the object remained at its correct spatial 
position and the next object had to be placed in the arena. When all 20 objects were 
placed, participants received feedback about their overall performance ((n correct objects 
/ n of total objects), where an object was classified as correct when both the sequence and 
spatial position were correct). 
To manipulate pre-sleep memory strength, participants in different groups finished 
training after meeting two different levels of performance. Pre-sleep memory strength 
was defined as ‘weaker’ for participants with a performance criterion of 50%, reached in 
one training round (1x50%) and defined as ‘stronger’ when the performance criterion was 
set to 70%, reached in two consecutive training rounds (2x70%). 
After finishing the training session, participants performed a pre-delay retrieval task. The 
retrieval started, like the training session, with all 20 objects randomly arranged around 
the arena and the objects had to be dragged and dropped in the correct sequence to the 
correct spatial position. Importantly though, no feedback was provided, and errors were 
not corrected meaning that the objects remained at the spatial position where they were 
dropped.  
As we compared memory performance between two retrieval tasks performed at different 
times of day (pre vs. post-delay retrieval, AM vs. PM or PM vs. AM), an alternative 
explanation for a change in memory performance might be a change in attention/level of 
alertness. We thus employed a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) directly before both 

 
40 
retrieval tasks. The PVT started with a white fixation cross presented in the middle of the 
screen. After an average of 6 seconds (with a jitter of ± 4s), the fixation cross was replaced 
by a counter starting at 0 and counting forwards to 2000 in 20ms steps. During that time, 
participants had to press the space bar as fast as possible. Feedback about their reaction 
time was provided after the key press (displayed for 2s).   
In session one encoding, training, PVT and pre-delay retrieval were completed. 12 hours 
later participants returned to the lab for the second session. For half of the participants 
the second session started with an interference task, designed to increase the post-delay 
retrieval difficulty. Participants were not informed about the interference task until the 
beginning of the second session. During the interference task, participants were asked to 
encode the same objects presented in a different sequence and at different spatial positions 
(Figure 1). The new spatial position of every object was more than 5 pixels away from its 
original spatial position (centre to centre distance). Encoding of the interfering 
temporospatial arrangement was implemented in the same way as the original encoding. 
Following encoding, participants performed a retrieval session of the interfering 
arrangement (no training was conducted for the new arrangement). Finally, participants 
performed a second PVT and the retrieval task for the original arrangement (post-delay 
retrieval). All participants in the no-interference condition directly started with the PVT 
and the post-delay retrieval of the original arrangement.  
 
 
 

 
41 
4.3. 
Study design 
We used a 2 (Delay: sleep vs. wake) x 2 (Memory Strength: weaker vs. stronger) x 2 
(Retrieval difficulty: no interference vs. interference) between-subjects design and 
participants were randomly assigned to one of the resulting 8 conditions (Figure 2).  
Participants in the sleep conditions performed the first session including encoding, 
training, PVT and pre-delay retrieval in the evening around 9 pm. After finishing the first 
session they went home to sleep. 12 hours later, at 9 am, they returned to the lab to 
perform the second session. Half of the participants additionally conducted the 
interference at the beginning of the second session while the other half directly started 
with the PVT and post-delay retrieval. Participants in the wake conditions followed the 
same protocol shifted by 12 hours, i.e., performing the first session (encoding, training, 
PVT and pre-delay retrieval) at 9 am and returning to the lab 12 hours later at 9 pm for 
the second session (interference, PVT and post-delay retrieval or PVT and post-delay 
retrieval, respectively).  
4.4. 
Data collection & analysis 
The Memory Arena was implemented with MATLAB 2016a (MathWorks). Behavioural 
responses were recorded using the mouse. Data were prepared and analysed using 
MATLAB and statistical analyses were conducted with the statistical software R. For data 
visualization raincloud tools in R were used (Allen, Poggiali, Whitaker, Marshall, & 
Kievit, 2019; van Langen, 2020). 

 
42 
To capture memory performance, we considered two variables: sequence performance 
and spatial error (placement distance). Sequence performance was based on correct 
transitions within the sequence (3rd object is chosen after the 2nd object) rather than on the 
absolute sequential position (3rd object is chosen at 3rd position), as the absolute sequential 
position is not necessarily the most sensitive measurement for memory performance. For 
example, if the second object in the sequence was erroneously placed first but then the 
order was correctly remembered for all subsequent objects, scoring the absolute positions 
would yield a performance score of 0. However, by scoring the transition between objects, 
all but the last (which now comes after the 19th placement but should have come first) are 
correct. Hence, the sequence performance was calculated based on the difference between 
object xi and object xi-1, where i is the selected sequence position of object x. If the 
transition is correct this difference is 1. The sum of the correct transitions was then 
divided by the total number of possible transitions (n = 19 when nobj = 20) and multiplied 
with 100 to get a percentage score. The spatial error was calculated using the Euclidean 
distance (in pixels) between the centre of the original position and the centre of the placed 
position of every object. 
To test the effects of our experimental factors (Figure 2), parametric ANOVAs were 
applied. Welch’s t-tests were used as post-hoc comparisons as variances between groups 
were not always equal. Note that for Welch’s t-tests, degrees of freedom are adjusted 
according to the Welch–Satterthwaite equation. For effect sizes, we report partial eta 
squared (ηp2) for ANOVAs and Cohens d for Welch’s t-tests. Shapiro-Wilk tests were 
applied to test for normal distributions of pre- and post-delay performance.  

 
43 
As traditional null-hypothesis testing does not allow for conclusions about the absence of 
an effect, we also conducted Bayesian analyses for all non-significant effects using the 
BayesFactor package in R (Morey & Rouder, 2015). According to the BayesFactor 
package, we used a Cauchy distribution (0, 0.707) as a prior. The Bayes factor BF01 (BF01 
= 1/BF10) informs about the likelihood to observe the data if the null hypothesis is true 
(P(D | H0) / P( D| H1)). A Bayes factor (BF01) between 1-3 can be considered as anecdotal 
evidence, 3-10 as moderate, 10-30 as strong, 30-100 as very strong and >100 as extreme 
evidence for H0 (Lee & Wagenmakers, 2013).

7. Supplemental Information 
Analogous to sequence consolidation, we conducted a 2x2x2 ANOVA for spatial 
consolidation with Delay (sleep vs. wake), Memory Strength (weaker vs. stronger) and 
Retrieval Difficulty (no interference vs. interference) as between-subjects factors. Spatial 
consolidation reflects the relative change in error rate (placement distance) from pre- to 
post-delay retrieval. Thus, values > 100% show an increase in error rate, < 100% show a 
decrease and values = 100% show a stabilization of error rate. Overall, post-relative to 
pre-delay error rate was significantly higher in wake groups than in sleep groups (main 
effect for Delay: F(1,112) = 9.22, p = .003, ηp2= 0.08) and higher for high retrieval 
difficulty compared to low retrieval difficulty (main effect for Retrieval Difficulty: 
F(1,112) = 25.71, p < .001, ηp2= 0.19). In contrast to sequence consolidation, we did not 
find a significant three way interaction (F(1, 112) = 0.34, p = .560, ηp2< 0.01, BF01 = 4.57). 
Nevertheless, to fully characterise sleep-dependent consolidation effects for spatial 
memory, we conducted the same subsidiary ANOVAs as described in the main text. 
First, a 2x2 ANOVA with the between-subjects factors Delay (sleep vs. wake) and 
Memory Strength (weaker vs. stronger) was used for the no interference groups only. 
Spatial consolidation did not significantly differ between sleep and wake groups (main 
effect Delay: F(1,56) = 2.59, p = .113, ηp2= 0.04, BF01 = 1.28) and there was no 
modulation by initial memory strength (interaction of Delay x Strength: F(1,56) = 1.49, 
p = .228, ηp2= 0.03, BF01 = 2.06, Figure S1A).

Neither for weaker nor for stronger memory opportunities did spatial consolidation 
(relative change in error rate from pre- to post-delay retrieval) significantly differ between 
the sleep (grey, circle) and the wake group (white, triangle). B. Pre- and post-delay error

participant data (grey filled circles for sleep groups and orange filled triangles for wake 
groups), density plots and group means with 95% CIs are shown in A and B. + = .1 ≥ p > 
.05; * = p ≤ .05 
Second, a 2x2 ANOVA with the between-subjects factors Delay (sleep vs. wake) and 
Memory Strength (weaker vs. stronger) for the interference groups was conducted. In line 
with our notion that an increase in retrieval difficulty unveils sleep-dependent 
consolidation processes, we found a significant difference between the sleep and the wake 
groups (main effect Delay: F(1,56) = 7.68, p = .008, ηp2= 0.12). Similar to sequence 

 
46 
consolidation (see main text, section 3.3.), the sleep-dependent consolidation effect for 
spatial memory was comparable for weaker and stronger memory opportunities (no Delay 
x Strength interaction: F(1,56) = 0.12, p = .727, ηp2< 0.01, BF01 = 3.64, Figure S2A), albeit 
only reaching significance for stronger memory opportunities (t(18.14) = -2.31, p = .033, 
d = 0.84) and not for weaker memory opportunities (t(15.33) = -1.64, p = .121, d = 0.60, 
BF01 = 1.07).  
 
Figure S 2.2. Spatial consolidation effects (error rate) for interference groups. A. Overall, 
spatial consolidation is significantly worse (greater relative change in error rate from pre- 
to post-delay retrieval) for the wake group (white, triangle) than for the sleep group (grey, 
circle). Note that results did not qualitatively change when outliers (N = 3) were excluded.

are shown in A and B. * = p ≤ .05; ** = p < .01; *** = p < .001 

 
47 
Lastly, we conducted two 2x2 ANOVAs with the between-subjects factors Delay and 
Retrieval Difficulty for weaker and stronger memory opportunities, respectively. For 
stronger memory opportunities the sleep-dependent consolidation effect significantly 
increased from low to high retrieval difficulty (interaction Delay x Retrieval Difficulty 
for stronger memories: F(1,56) = 4.88, p = .031, ηp2= 0.08). Note that an increase in sleep-
dependent consolidation is reflected by more negative values as the error rate was used. 
For weaker memory opportunities, there was an overall trend for a sleep-dependent 
consolidation effect (main effect Delay, F(1,56) = 3.95, p = .0518, ηp2= 0.07), without a 
significant interaction of Delay x Retrieval Difficulty (F(1,56) = 1.51, p = .225, ηp2= 0.03, 
BF01 = 2.24, Figure S3).  
 

 
48 
Figure S 2.3. Sleep-dependent consolidation effects. For stronger memory opportunities, 
the difference in spatial consolidation (relative change in error rate from pre- to post-
delay retrieval) between sleep and wake significantly increased with higher retrieval 
difficulty (interference).  Shown are differences in means between sleep and wake groups 
and the corresponding 95% CIs. * = p ≤ .05 
In sum, while increased retrieval difficulty also unveiled a sleep-dependent consolidation 
effect for strong spatial memories, effects for weak spatial memories were more subtle 
than for their sequence memory counterparts. One explanation might be that sequence 
memory was more sensitive to our initial memory strength manipulation (see main text, 
section 2.1. and 2.2.). Note also that both variables were operationalized on different 
scales. While sequence performance for an object is a binary outcome (correct or incorrect 
position in the sequence), spatial performance (i.e., spatial error) is a continuous variable 
(Euclidean distance from centre to centre in pixels). Further studies are needed in which 
temporal and spatial measures are more closely matched to adjudicate whether there are 
differential beneficial effects of sleep on temporal and spatial aspects of memory.  
As our memory strength manipulation was defined based on the overall performance 
during training, we also used overall performance as dependent variable and conducted 
the same analyses as with sequence and spatial performance. Overall performance is the 
combined sequence and spatial performance, with higher values denoting better 
performance. Therefore, overall performance consolidation (relative change from pre- to 
post-delay) can be interpreted analogous to sequence consolidation:  > 100% means an 
increase in performance, < 100% means a decrease and values = 100% mean stabilization 
of performance.  

 
49 
The results of the 2x2x2 ANOVA with Delay (sleep vs. wake), Memory Strength (weaker 
vs. stronger) and Retrieval Difficulty (no interference vs. interference) as between-
subjects factors matched the results for sequence performance. We found two significant 
main effects for Delay (F(1,112) = 12.72, p < .001, ηp2= 0.10) and Retrieval Difficulty 
(F(1,112) = 52.50, p < .001, ηp2= 0.32). The three way interaction - despite only showing 
a trend towards significance (F(1, 112) = 3.09, p = .081, ηp2= 0.03) - still suggests that 
sleep-dependent consolidation effects for weaker and stronger memory opportunities 
might differ as a function of retrieval difficulty. Therefore, we conducted the same 
subsidiary ANOVAs as described in the main text. 
For the no interference groups, the 2x2 ANOVA with the between-subjects factors Delay 
(sleep vs. wake) and Memory Strength (weaker vs. stronger) showed almost the same 
pattern as in the main text. Overall performance consolidation was significantly greater 
in sleep compared to wake groups (main effect Delay: F(1,56) = 5.00, p = .029, ηp2= 0.08) 
and this difference was modulated by the initial memory strength (interaction of Delay x 
Strength: F(1,56) = 5.39, p = .024, ηp2= 0.09). Post hoc t-tests showed no significant 
difference in overall performance consolidation between sleep and wake group for 
stronger memory opportunities (t(28) = -0.08, p = .938, d = 0.03, BF01 = 2.90). However, 
for weaker memory opportunities, the sleep group showed significantly greater overall 
performance consolidation than the wake group (t(27.93) = 2.72, p = .011, d = 0.99, 
Figure S4A).

Figure S 2.4. Consolidation effects for no interference groups. A. For weaker memory 
opportunities, overall performance consolidation (relative performance change from pre- 
to post-delay retrieval) is significantly greater in the sleep group (grey, circle) than in the 
wake group (orange, triangle), whereas there is no statistical difference between the sleep 
and wake group for stronger memory opportunities. B. Pre- and post-delay error rate for 
weaker (left column) and stronger memory opportunities (right column). Single 
participant data (grey filled circles for sleep groups and orange filled triangles for wake 
groups), density plots and group means with 95% CIs are shown in A and B. * = p ≤ .05; 
** = p < .01; n.s. = not significant, p > .1 
After increasing retrieval difficulty by inducing retroactive interference, we still found a 
higher overall performance consolidation in the sleep groups than in the wake groups 
(main effect of Delay: F(1,56) = 7.73, p = .007, ηp2= 0.12). Importantly, both weaker and 
stronger memory opportunities showed a significant sleep-dependent consolidation effect 

 
51 
(no Delay x Strength interaction: F(1,56) = 0.17, p = .684, ηp2= 0.003, BF01 = 3.57), 
indicating that both weaker and stronger memories benefited from post-learning sleep 
(Figure S5A). 
 
 
 
Figure S 2.5. Consolidation effects for interference groups. A. After inducing retroactive 
interference, overall performance consolidation (relative performance change from pre- 
to post-delay retrieval) is significantly greater in the sleep group (grey, circle) than in the 
wake group (orange, triangle) for stronger memory opportunities. B. Pre- and post-delay 
error rate for weaker (left column) and stronger memory opportunities (right column). 
Single participant data (grey filled circles for sleep groups and orange filled triangles for 
wake groups), density plots and group means with 95% CIs are shown in A and B. * = p 
≤ .05; ** = p < .01; n.s. = not significant, p > .1 

 
52 
In a last step, we conducted two 2x2 ANOVAs with the between-subjects factors Delay 
and Retrieval Difficulty for weaker as well as for stronger memory opportunities. For 
weaker memory opportunities, the increase in retrieval difficulty had no impact on sleep-
dependent consolidation effects (no interaction Delay x Retrieval Difficulty for weaker 
memories: F(1,56) = 0.38, p = .541, ηp2= 0.01, BF01 = 3.41). For stronger memory 
opportunities, sleep-dependent consolidation effects significantly increased from low to 
high retrieval difficulty (interaction of Delay x Retrieval Difficulty: F(1,56) = 4.21, p = 
.045, ηp2= 0.07, Figure S6).  
Taken together, the results using overall performance largely correspond to the results 
using sequence performance as dependent variable.

Figure S 2.6. Sleep-dependent consolidation effects, overall performance. With low 
retrieval difficulty (no interference), the difference in overall performance consolidation 
(relative performance change from pre- to post-delay retrieval) between sleep and wake 
is significant for weaker memory opportunities only. With an increase in retrieval 
difficulty (interference), sleep-dependent consolidation effects are seen for both weaker 
and stronger memory opportunities. Shown are differences in means between sleep and 
wake groups and the corresponding 95% CIs. + = .1 ≥ p > .05; * = p ≤ .05; n.s. = not 
significant, p > .1

Abstract 
Memory consolidation, the transformation of labile memory traces into stable long-term 
representations, is facilitated by post-learning sleep. Computational and biophysical 
models suggest that sleep spindles may play a key mechanistic role for consolidation, 
igniting structural changes at cortical sites involved in prior learning. Here we tested the 
resulting prediction that spindles are most pronounced over learning-related cortical areas 
and that the extent of this learning-spindle overlap predicts behavioural measures of 
memory consolidation. Using high-density scalp Electroencephalography (EEG) and 
Polysomnography (PSG) in healthy volunteers, we first identified cortical areas engaged 
during a temporospatial associative memory task (power decreases in the alpha/beta 
frequency range, 6-20 Hz). Critically, we found that participant-specific topographies 
(i.e., spatial distributions) of post-learning sleep spindle amplitude correlated with 
participant-specific learning topographies. Importantly, the extent to which spindles 
tracked learning patterns further predicted memory consolidation across participants. Our 
results provide empirical evidence for a role of post-learning sleep spindles in tracking 
learning networks, thereby facilitating memory consolidation.

1. Introduction 
Sleep after learning bolsters memory retention, a process referred to as sleep-dependent 
memory consolidation (Diekelmann & Born, 2010; Jenkins & Dallenbach, 1924; Müller 
& Pilzecker, 1900). In recent years, sleep spindles – transient 12-15 Hz oscillations 
generated within thalamo-cortical loops - have emerged as a prime mechanistic vehicle 
to support consolidation (Born & Wilhelm, 2012; Fernandez & Lüthi, 2020b; Klinzing et 
al., 2019; Lüthi, 2014; Mednick et al., 2013; Peyrache & Seibt, 2020). Previous studies 
have linked spindles to consolidation in terms of their density (the number of discrete 
spindle events per minute) (Gais et al., 2002), power (Holz et al., 2012) and activity, a 
combination of duration and amplitude (Schabus et al., 2004). Despite their ubiquity, 
however, the specific role spindles play for memory consolidation remains poorly 
understood.  
Ultimately, effective learning requires structural brain changes, beginning at the synaptic 
level 
(Bailey 
& 
Kandel, 
1993; 
Josselyn 
et 
al., 
2015). 
A 
hallmark 
computational/biophysical framework (Sejnowski & Destexhe, 2000) suggests that 
spindles are particularly well-suited to induce changes in synaptic plasticity. Specifically, 
spindles gate influx of calcium (Ca2+) into pyramidal dendrites, setting early synaptic 
consolidation processes in motion. Empirical support for this model has been provided 
by in-vitro application of spindle-like firing patterns (Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005) as well 
as by showing a direct modulation of Ca2+ activity in cortical pyramidal dendrites as a 
function of spindle power during natural sleep in rodents (Seibt et al., 2017). Moreover, 
cortical microelectrode array recordings in humans have shown that spindles group co-
firing of single units within 25 ms, i.e. within a time window conducive to spike-timing-

 
60 
dependent plasticity (Dickey et al., 2021). Critically, however, in order for spindles to 
promote memory consolidation in an adaptive fashion, they need to show some degree of 
regional specificity. That is, not only would global synaptic consolidation be of limited 
use in an ever-changing landscape of tasks, but it would also be at direct odds with extant 
models emphasising the role of sleep in global synaptic downscaling (Tononi & Cirelli, 
2006). Instead, adaptive consolidation has to be selective, specifically strengthening local 
circuits involved in prior learning.  
The current study thus set out to assess (i) whether spindles correspond to specific pre-
sleep learning patterns and (ii) whether this learning-spindle overlap supports memory 
consolidation. To this end, we employed a demanding memory task giving rise to rich 
and idiosyncratic activation patterns during encoding (Memory Arena, Figure 1). After 
learning, participants took a 2-hour nap before their memory retention was tested. This 
protocol allowed us to examine whether spindles recorded during this nap would 
correspond to participant-specific learning patterns and whether the extent of this 
learning-sleep overlap would predict behavioural expressions of consolidation. 
2. Results 
2.1. 
Behavioural results 
We employed a recently developed memory paradigm called ‘Memory Arena’ (Petzka et 
al., 2021) in which participants learn the temporospatial arrangement of objects in a 
circular enclosure across multiple training rounds (see Figure 1A and Methods for 
details). Memory for the temporospatial arrangement was assessed in a first retrieval 

 
61 
block (pre-sleep retrieval) which was followed by a 2-hour nap (see Table S1 for 
descriptive data of sleep stages). Following the nap, participants were instructed to learn 
a new temporospatial arrangement of the same objects (retroactive interference), after 
which they were asked to retrieve the original arrangement (post-sleep retrieval, Figure 
1C). As the dependent measure, we use sequence memory performance as our previous 
work suggested this was the measure most sensitive to capture sleep-dependent 
consolidation. As expected, we found a significant decrease in sequence performance 
from pre- to post-sleep retrieval of the original sequence (t(18) = 4.65, p < .001, Figure 
1D). For further analyses, memory consolidation is defined as memory retention, i.e., the 
relative change in sequence performance from pre- to post-sleep retrieval.  
Figure 3.1. Task, experimental design, behavioural results and group EEG encoding 
pattern. (A) Memory Arena. During encoding 20 objects were presented in a specific 
sequence at different spatial positions. Both sequence and spatial position had to be 
encoded. Training (and retrieval) started with all 20 objects arranged around the arena 
and participants had to drag and drop the objects in the correct sequence to the correct 
spatial position. During training, feedback was given after each trial and errors were 

 
62 
corrected. Training was completed after reaching a performance criterion of 70% twice 
in a row. Retroactive interference was induced by encoding the same objects but in a 
different sequence and at different spatial positions. (B) Every trial of the Psychomotor 
Vigilance Task (PVT) started with a fixation cross. After a delay of 8-15 sec a counter 
started (numbers count). Participants had to press a key as fast as possible and received 
feedback about their reaction time (RT). (C) Participants performed the PVT, encoding, 
training and first retrieval before the 2-hour nap. After the nap, an interference session 
was employed (1x encoding and retrieval, no training), followed by the second retrieval 
of the originally learned arena. (D) Sequence memory significantly decreased from pre- 
to post-sleep. Single participant data, density plots and group means with 95% CIs are

from 6 – 20 Hz during encoding (grey rectangle), most pronounced over temporo-parietal 
areas (bars shown for electrode CP4 - black circle on topography plot).  
2.2. 
EEG results: Spindle amplitude tracks encoding patterns 
To assess whether sleep spindles track learning sites, we first derived an ‘encoding 
pattern’ for each participant. To specifically unravel learning-related activity, we 
contrasted oscillatory power (1-20 Hz) during encoding with power during a control 
condition (Psychomotor Vigilance Task, PVT). On the group level, this contrast revealed 
a significant power decrease in the alpha/beta frequency range (6-20 Hz) during encoding 
relative to the PVT, particularly over right temporo-parietal areas (Figure 1E). This result 
is consistent with previous findings linking decreases in alpha/beta power to memory 
processes (Griffiths et al., 2019, 2021; Hanslmayr et al., 2012; Lega et al., 2017; Noh et 
al., 2014). The reliable group effect notwithstanding, there was considerable variability 
in participant-specific effect topographies of the 6-20 Hz power decrease (Figure S1), 
allowing us to explore whether these participant-specific encoding patterns would bias 
particular event characteristics during subsequent sleep. 

 
63 
As outlined in the introduction, we hypothesized that the topography (i.e., spatial 
distribution) of sleep spindles might be modulated by engagement during pre-sleep 
learning. We thus algorithmically detected sleep spindles during the post-learning nap 
(see Methods) for every channel and extracted their amplitude as well as duration and 
density. As a control, we performed the same analyses for algorithmically detected slow 
oscillations (SOs), which have also been linked to memory consolidation (Heib et al., 
2013; Holz et al., 2012; Huber et al., 2004). At the group level, spindles and SOs showed 
the established prevalence over centro-parietal and frontal areas, respectively (see Figure 
S2 for amplitude, density and duration topographies of spindles and SOs). Furthermore 
and in line with previous observations (Helfrich et al., 2018; Mölle et al., 2002; Muehlroth 
et al., 2019; Schreiner et al., 2021), detected spindle events were on average temporally 
coupled to the up-state of the SO signal (0.3-1.25 Hz, see Figure S3). 
We next turned to the question whether inter-individual differences in the topography of 
sleep events relate to inter-individual differences in learning topographies. For each 
participant, the encoding topography (6-20 Hz power relative to the PVT across 58 
channels) was correlated (Spearman’s rho) with the corresponding topography of 6 
different sleep patterns (amplitude, duration and density for spindles and SOs across 58 
channels). Note that all sleep measures are positively scaled except the SO amplitude. For 
simplicity, we unified all scales by taking the absolute value of the SO amplitude. As 
encoding activity is associated with a decrease in power (negatively scaled values), 
encoding-sleep overlap would be signified by negative correlations. 

 
64 
Participant-specific correlation values were then evaluated at the group level. First, we 
conducted a 2 (event type:   spindles   vs.   SOs) x 3 (event characteristic: amplitude, 
duration, density) repeated measures ANOVA (Figure 2A), assessing whether particular 
sleep event topographies track idiosyncratic encoding topographies. Results revealed that 
topographies of overall spindle characteristics correlated with encoding patterns to a 
greater extent than SO characteristics (main effect of event type F(1,18) = 13.12, p <.001, 
Figure 2B). This was the case for event amplitudes (t(18) = -3.16, p = .005), durations 
(t(18) = -2.53, p = .021) as well as densities (t(18) = -2.14, p = .046). Furthermore, the 
correlation between all three spindle characteristics with the encoding pattern was 
significantly smaller than 0 (spindle amplitude: meanr = -0.38, t(18) = -3.50, p = .003, 
spindle duration: meanr = -0.27, t(18) = -3.26, p = .004, spindle density: meanr = -0.30, 
t(18) = -3.56, p = .002). There was a trend for the main effect of event characteristic 
(amplitude topographies correlating strongest with encoding patterns, F(2,36) = 2.61, p = 
.078) and no interaction (F(2,36) = 0.63, p = .532). 
Figure 3.2. Sleep spindles track cortical learning sites. (A) Grand average (mean ± 95% 
CI) of spindles and SOs at electrode position Cz. Amplitude, duration and density were 
extracted for each participant and channel. (B) Across participants, encoding 
topographies were significantly more strongly correlated with topographies of spindles 
than SOs (density plots, group means, 95% CIs and single participant data are shown. ** 
= p < .01. * = p < .05).  

 
65 
To account for the possibility that spindle amplitude, duration and density topographies 
are correlated amongst each other, we conducted follow-up partial correlations between 
encoding patterns and spindle characteristics. Interestingly, the link between encoding 
and spindle amplitude remained significantly different from 0 when partialling out 
spindle duration or spindle density (for both: meanr < -0.23, t(18) < -2.11, p < .049). When 
partialling out spindle amplitude, however, the overlap between spindle duration/density 
and encoding pattern was not significantly different from 0 (duration: meanr = -0.15, t(18) 
= -1.82, p = .086; density: meanr = -0.01, t(18) = -0.15, p = .885). Together, these results 
suggest that the spindle-encoding overlap is predominantly driven by spindle amplitude.   
To examine whether the overlap with encoding patterns might be restricted to spindles 
that are coupled to SO up-states, we directly compared the encoding-spindle overlap 
(amplitude topographies) for spindle events with higher vs. lower coupling (see 
Methods). We observed no significant difference between the two event types (t(18) = -
0.66, p = .521, see Figure S4). 
Finally, we tested whether the overlap of sleep spindle amplitude and encoding activation 
is linked to behavioural expressions of memory consolidation. To this end, we correlated 
the encoding-spindle amplitude overlap with the relative change in sequence performance 
from pre- to post-sleep retrieval (memory retention) across participants. Indeed, a 
significant negative correlation was observed (r = -0.58, p = .010), indicating that 
participants who showed greater retention of sequence memory also had a greater overlap 
(signified by a more negative value) between encoding and sleep spindle topography 
(Figure 3A). To ensure that the link with behaviour was driven by participant-specific 
encoding-spindle overlap, we first shuffled the encoding topographies between 
participants while retaining participant-specific sleep spindle topography and behavioural 

 
66 
performance. Likewise, we shuffled the sleep spindle topographies between participants 
while retaining participant-specific encoding topography and behavioural performance 
(see Figure 3B for visualization). That way we generated a distribution under the null 
hypothesis that (a) the encoding topography or (b) sleep spindle topography is irrelevant 
for the observed correlation with behaviour. As shown in Figure 3C, the empirical 
correlation between encoding-spindle overlap and behaviour significantly exceeded the 
null distributions in both cases (p = .011 for (a) and p = .018 for (b) based on 1000 
permutations). 
 
Figure 3.3. Extent of encoding-spindle overlap predicts memory consolidation. (A) The 
correlation between encoding and spindle amplitude topographies is predictive for 
sequence retention. The more negative the correlation between spindle amplitude and 
encoding topographies (i.e., the greater the overlap), the greater the levels of sequence 
retention across sleep. (B) Schematic for generating the null distributions in C. Encoding 
or sleep spindle topographies were shuffled across participants while the respective other 
topography (spindle amplitude or encoding power) and behavioural performance were 
retained. (C) The observed correlation between encoding-spindle amplitude overlap and 
sequence retention exceeds both null distributions of encoding or spindle pattern 
exchangeability.

3. Discussion 
Despite accumulating evidence linking sleep spindles to memory consolidation (Born & 
Wilhelm, 2012; Fernandez & Lüthi, 2020b; Gais et al., 2002; Holz et al., 2012; Klinzing 
et al., 2016; Lüthi, 2014; Mednick et al., 2013; Schabus et al., 2004), their specific 
function has remained elusive. Here we tested predictions derived from 
biophysical/computational models, i.e., that spindles are preferentially expressed over 
learning-related sites where they might induce early stages of synaptic plasticity 
(Sejnowski & Destexhe, 2000). Using a recently developed paradigm sensitive to sleep-
dependent memory consolidation (Petzka et al., 2021) and geared towards eliciting rich 
idiosyncratic encoding patterns (Figure 1), we first demonstrate that sleep spindles – in 
particular the topography of spindle amplitudes – track cortical patterns of memory 
encoding (Figure 2). This overlap of encoding patterns with spindles was significantly 
stronger than that with slow oscillations (SOs), ruling out spurious correlations driven by 
generic signal properties across EEG channels. Importantly, we additionally reveal a 
functional link between the observed encoding-spindle overlap and memory 
consolidation, expressed in greater overlap associated with greater levels of memory 
retention (Figure 3).  
Previous work has revealed a number of spindle characteristics that render them well-
suited for inducing local plasticity in task-dependent/learning-related brain regions. For 
instance, intracranial recordings in humans have shown that sleep spindles are local rather 
than global (Nir et al., 2011; Piantoni et al., 2017) and scalp EEG/MEG has demonstrated 
high levels of inter-subject variability of spindle topographies (Cox et al., 2017; Klinzing 
et al., 2016). Moreover, spindle topographies vary as a function of prior learning tasks at 

 
68 
the group level – spindles over left frontal areas are related to consolidation of verbal 
material (Clemens et al., 2005), whereas spindles over parietal areas are related to 
consolidation of visuospatial memories (Clemens et al., 2006). However, as brain activity 
was not measured during learning in these studies, the link between learning activation 
and post-learning spindle topography remained conjectural. Another study employed 
simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings and found a BOLD increase in learning-related 
ventro-temporal regions time-locked to sleep spindles at electrode position Cz (Bergmann 
et al., 2012), but whether spindles per se would be preferentially expressed at learning-
related sites remained unclear due to limited EEG coverage. Finally, we recently showed 
that learning content can be decoded in the presence of centrally recorded sleep spindles 
(Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018; Schreiner et al., 2021), but decoding was based on raw 
EEG data rather than on spindle topographies. In short, despite converging evidence that 
spindle expression can be local, idiosyncratic and flexible, we here provide first evidence 
that they track participant-specific learning patterns in service of memory consolidation. 
These results dovetail with a recent computational study showing that spindles promote 
independent reactivation of multiple memories at network locations corresponding to 
awake training (Wei et al., 2018).  
It deserves mention that the spatial resolution afforded by scalp EEG is relatively coarse, 
only 
capturing 
macro-scale 
topographies 
of 
brain 
networks. 
Intracranial 
recordings/Electrocorticography (ECoG) would provide much finer resolution, albeit at 
the expense of comprehensive whole-brain coverage and consistency across participants. 
That said, a recent study used cortical microelectrode array recordings (Utah Arrays) in 
four pre-surgical epilepsy patients and demonstrated different spindle- and unit firing 
dynamics across a 10 x 10 electrode grid covering < 15 mm2 (Dickey et al., 2021). This 

 
69 
suggests that spindle deployment might be sufficiently fine-tuned in space to selectively 
strengthen local microcircuits of learning networks. 
A key open question is how exactly the deployment of spindles to learning-related cortical 
sites is governed. One speculative possibility is that circuit-specific encoding activation 
establishes transient synaptic tags. Spindles are initially broadcast widely and 
stochastically during sleep but resonate more strongly when coinciding with those 
synaptically primed circuits. This leads to higher spindle amplitudes and a concomitant 
increase in Ca2+ influx, completing the tag-and-capture cycle suggested to underlie long-
term-potentiation (Redondo & Morris, 2011). Increased spindle amplitude, as observed 
here and in other studies (Bergmann et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2014; Yordanova et al., 2017), 
would thus reflect elevated local neural co-activation as a vestige of prior task 
engagement. 
Another possibility is that the same thalamic circuits control deployment of attentional 
resources during wake task performance and spindles during sleep. For instance, a recent 
study capitalised on the orientation-specific response potentiation (OSRP) in mouse 
primary visual cortex (V1), which reflects enhanced firing to a visual grating of particular 
orientation several hours after initial exposure/training. Importantly, neurons in the lateral 
geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus already showed orientation-selective tuning 
during and immediately after training. During post-training sleep, thalamocortical 
coherence mediated by sleep spindles drove post-sleep orientation-selective tuning in V1 
(Durkin et al., 2017). Additional work is needed to elucidate whether similar mechanisms 
apply to more complex tasks in humans, but accumulating evidence across species has 
linked thalamic microcircuits to a wide range of cognitive tasks (Halassa & Kastner, 
2017). This scenario, in which thalamocortical dynamics during learning bias the path of 

 
70 
spindle deployment during sleep, is reminiscent of models of hippocampal functioning. 
Specifically, according to the hippocampal indexing theory (Teyler & Discenna, 1986), 
the hippocampus retains pointers to cortical circuits involved in learning. Upon 
presentation of a partial cue, hippocampus drives reinstatement (pattern completion) in 
cortical target sites. Recent work in rodents (Rothschild et al., 2017) and humans (Ngo et 
al., 2020) points to a cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop around hippocampal ripples, and 
a tentative scenario might be that the initial cortical response in this loop is mediated by 
the aforementioned thalamo-cortical spindle projections.  
Apart from spindles, memory processing during sleep has been linked to slow oscillations 
(SOs) and delta (1-4 Hz) rhythms, together referred to as slow wave activity (SWA) (Born 
& Wilhelm, 2012; Marshall et al., 2006; Rasch & Born, 2013; Tononi & Cirelli, 2006). 
One seminal study showed that SWA was specifically increased over central cortical 
areas thought to be involved in prior motor learning (Huber et al., 2004). Likewise, wake 
immobilisation of a participant’s arm led to a decrease in SWA over corresponding motor 
areas (Huber et al., 2006). Interestingly though, analogous effects were seen in the 
spindle/sigma band in both studies, raising the possibility that both SOs/SWA and 
spindles contribute to sleep-dependent consolidation. One pressing question is whether 
consolidation relies on concomitant or on sequential occurrence of these two sleep events. 
Speaking to the importance of concomitant SWA-spindles, a recent rodent study showed 
that Ca2+ activity was increased threefold when spindles were coupled to slow oscillations 
(Niethard et al., 2018). The importance of coupled SO-spindle complexes has been further 
corroborated by a series of recent findings linking the precision of SO-spindle coupling 
to memory function in ageing (Helfrich et al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019) and to 
reinstatement of prior learning experiences during sleep (Schreiner et al., 2021). 

 
71 
However, we did not observe greater overlap of encoding patterns with spindles coupled 
vs. not coupled to SOs in the current study (Figure S4). Interestingly, a recent EEG/MEG 
study showed that the topography of spindles was unaffected by the topography of 
concurrent SOs (Klinzing et al., 2016). This raises the possibility that consolidation of 
learning patterns relies, at least in part, on the sequential occurrence of spindles and SOs. 
Indeed, in the original framework (Sejnowski & Destexhe, 2000) as well as in a recent 
computational model (Wei et al., 2018), it is proposed that SOs, which show enhanced 
prevalence during later sleep stages, further potentiate strong synapses, incidentally 
leading to downscaling of weak synapses (Tononi & Cirelli, 2003). In other words, sleep-
dependent consolidation might rely on a multi-stage tagging and capture sequence, 
initiated by wake task performance, potentiated by thalamocortical sleep spindles in 
conjunction with hippocampal ripples, and completed by SOs. Whole-night recordings 
would be better-suited to test this notion than the current nap design. 
Apart from the nap design, there are additional limitations in the present study. First, 
conclusions remain correlative rather than causal. A previous study (Lustenberger et al., 
2016) used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to enhance sleep spindles, 
leading to improved post-sleep motor memory performance. It would be intriguing to test 
whether ‘playing back’ participant-specific learning patterns in the form of exogenously 
induced spindle topographies enhances consolidation in our current paradigm. However, 
the spatio-temporal precision required for this endeavor (simultaneously inducing 
different spindle amplitudes at different locations across cortex) would exceed capacities 
of current human non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) tools. Second, the nature of our 
paradigm precludes a direct link between encoding patterns and behavioural performance 
during pre-sleep retrieval as well as requires an external baseline (PVT). Specifically, 

 
72 
unlike in one-shot event-related memory paradigms, retrieval performance here is the 
product of encoding and multiple rounds of training including feedback. Further, the 
absence of clear events (i.e., trials) entails the absence of a baseline for the EEG analysis. 
Consequently, an external baseline had to be used. As the PVT resembles the nature of a 
pre-stimulus baseline in event-related memory paradigms (fixation of a fixation cross in 
the center of the screen), we utilized it as the external baseline. It is worth considering 
that the observed encoding pattern was calculated relative the external baseline and 
cannot be interpreted independently of the activity PVT. Nevertheless, the encoding 
pattern observed here (alpha/beta power decreases over temporo-parietal areas) is 
consistent with previous studies of memory formation (Fellner et al., 2013; Griffiths et 
al., 2016; Hanslmayr et al., 2009; Klimesch et al., 1996).  
To conclude, the present study demonstrates that sleep spindles track cortical areas 
engaged during prior learning and that the extent of learning-spindle overlap predicts 
levels of memory consolidation. An exciting avenue for future work will be to elucidate 
the spatiotemporal dynamics between spindles, ripples and slow oscillations across the 
hippocampus and neocortical sites, both in close temporal proximity and across a whole 
night of sleep.

4. Methods  
4.1. 
Participants 
22 participants were tested. Due to technical issues during data collection, 3 participants 
had to be excluded resulting in 19 participants for the final sample (meanage = 20.7, 
rangeage = 18-31, female = 15).  
Pre-screening ensured that participants had no history of neurological or psychiatric 
disorders and a normal sleep-wake cycle. Participants were instructed to get up one hour 
earlier than normal and avoid caffeine the day of the experiment. After participating in 
the study, participants received monetary reimbursement. The study was approved by the 
University of Birmingham Research Ethics and Governance Committee and written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants before the start of the study.  
4.2. 
Paradigm and procedure 
Memory Arena and PVT were implemented via custom scripts in MATLAB 2016a 
(MathWorks, Natick, USA). For the PVT, functions of the Psychophysics Toolbox 
Version 3.0.14 (Brainard, 1997) were used.  
Memory Arena 
The Memory Arena consists of a circle divided into coloured quarters (upper left: blue, 
upper right: green, lower right: yellow, lower left: red). Within the circle, objects are 
sequentially presented in different spatial positions. Participants have to learn both the 
sequence in which the objects were presented as well as the spatial position of each object.  

 
74 
20 target objects (images of 5 faces, 5 natural objects, 5 animals and 5 manmade objects) 
were randomly selected from a stimulus pool of 40 objects (coloured and presented on a 
grey 90x90 pixels square) (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008; Mehrer et al., 2021). The spatial 
position of each object was restricted by the position of other objects. Consequently, there 
was no overlap between objects, but objects possibly covered more than one colour 
wedge.  
Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) 
A white fixation cross was presented in the middle of the screen. After on average 6 
seconds (jitter ± 4s), a counter replaced the fixation cross. The counter started at 0 and 
counted forward in 20 ms steps to 2000. Upon start of the counter, participants had to 
press the space bar as fast as possible. After the key press, feedback about their reaction 
time was displayed for 2s (Figure 1B). Overall, the PVT lasted 2 minutes.  
Procedure 
The experimental session started at 10 am with the application of electroencephalography 
(EEG), electromyography (EMG) and electrooculography (EOG).  
Approximately one hour later at 11 am, participants started with a short practice session 
(~20 sec) of the PVT which was followed by the actual task. Before they continued with 
the Memory Arena, participants received written instructions and performed a practice 
session (with 3 objects) of each Memory Arena part (encoding, training and retrieval). 
Participants were instructed to associate and combine the objects into a coherent story.  
During the encoding part of the Memory Arena, all 20 objects were sequentially presented 
within the circle. Participants confirm processing of each object by clicking on it. The 
current object then disappeared, and the next object was presented.  

 
75 
Directly after the encoding part, a training session was conducted. The training session 
started with all 20 objects arranged around the arena. The objects had to be dragged and 
dropped in the correct sequence to their correct spatial position. If an error was made 
regarding the sequence or spatial position, the arena turned red and the error was 
corrected. Sequence errors were defined as object i not being placed at the ith position.  
Spatial errors were defined as the overlap between correct and chosen position of an 
object being less than 25%. After potential error corrections, the object remained at its 
correct spatial position and the next object had to be selected and placed in the arena. 
When all 20 objects were placed, feedback about the overall performance was presented. 
The overall performance was defined as the number of correct objects divided by the total 
number of objects, where an object was classified as correct when sequence as well as 
spatial position were correct. Participants finished training after reaching 70% overall 
performance in two consecutive runs.  
A second PVT then followed the training session. After the PVT, the pre-sleep retrieval 
was completed. Like the training, the retrieval started with all 20 objects arranged around 
the arena which had to be dragged and dropped in the correct sequence to their correct 
spatial position. Importantly though, errors were not corrected and no feedback was 
provided.    
Participants started the 2-hour nap between 1pm - 2.30pm (see Table S1 for descriptive 
sleep data). Following the nap, participants continued with an interference task. We were 
particularly interested in using an experimental design that is suitable to capture sleep-
dependent memory consolidation. In a previous study, we used the same task (Memory 
Arena) and found sleep-dependent consolidation effects with a combination of a 2x70% 
training threshold (70% overall performance in two consecutive runs) and the induction 

 
76 
of retroactive interference directly after sleep (Petzka et al., 2021). Therefore, in this 
study, we applied the same methods.  
During the interference task, participants had to encode the same 20 objects but in a 
different sequence and at different spatial positions (Figure 1A). The difference between 
the old and the new, interfering, spatial position of every object was at least 5 pixels 
(Euclidean distance). Encoding of the interfering positions was conducted in the same 
way as the original encoding. Subsequently, participants had to retrieve the interfering 
sequence and spatial positions (without prior training). Lastly, another PVT and the post-
sleep retrieval (of the original sequence and spatial positions) were performed. Until the 
start of the post-sleep retrieval, participants were unaware of the final test.  
4.3. 
EEG data recording 
EEG data were recorded using a Brain Products 64-channel EEG system and were 
sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz. Electrodes were arranged according to the 10-20 system 
(including FCz as reference, AFz as ground and left and right mastoids). Two electrodes 
were placed on the chin to record muscle activity (electromyography, EMG) and two 
electrodes recorded eye movements (electrooculography, EOG).  
4.4. 
Behavioural analysis 
In a previous study using the same paradigm, we found that  sequence performance was 
most sensitive measure to capture sleep-dependent memory consolidation (Petzka et al., 
2021). Consequently, all following analyses focus on sequence performance.  
To calculate sequence performance, the selected order of all 20 object was correlated with 
a vector ranging, in ascending order, from 1 to 20. This correlation approach is preferable 

 
77 
to simply counting the correct sequence position of every object, as it reflects both the 
correct sequence position of every object as well as correct transitions between objects. 
Correlation values were Fisher z-transformed for further statistical analyses. To test for a 
significant sequence performance change from pre- to post-sleep retrieval, a paired t-test 
was computed.   
For correlating the change in sequence performance with the EEG data, a sequence 
retention score was calculated as the relative change from pre- to post- sleep sequence 
retrieval: 100*(post/pre). 
4.5. 
EEG analysis  
EEG analyses were performed using the FieldTrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011) and 
custom written scripts in MATLAB.  
Encoding pattern 
To remove eye movements from the data, an independent component analysis (ICA) was 
used. Data were down-sampled to 200 Hz, re-referenced to linked mastoids, filtered 
(high-pass: 1 Hz, low-pass: 100 Hz, band-stop filter: 48-52 Hz), demeaned and segmented 
in 2 second epochs for a first visual artifact rejection. All phases of the Memory Arena 
and the PVT were concatenated, coarse artifacts were removed based on outliers 
regarding amplitude, kurtosis and variance (implemented in ft_rejectvisual) and bad 
channels were rejected. Based on those data, the unmixing matrix was obtained and bad 
components were identified. The raw data were then preprocessed again, as the first 
preprocessing was optimized for ICA. The data were down-sampled to 200 Hz, re-
referenced to linked mastoids, filtered (high-pass: 0.3 Hz, low-pass: 40 Hz) and 

 
78 
demeaned. The unmixing matrix was applied to the new preprocessed data and bad 
channels were interpolated.  
To derive encoding patterns, the encoding part of the Memory Arena was contrasted 
against the PVT. Note that the PVT was conducted in temporal proximity to the Memory 
Arena and requires sustained attention but no memory-related processes. The data 
recorded during the encoding part of the Memory Arena and the PVT were segmented 
into 1 second epochs (50% overlap), tapered with a Hanning window and transformed 
from time to frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transformation. To facilitate 
reproducibility of results, artifacts were defined based on the 95th percentile uniquely for 
each frequency bin distribution (across epochs). All 1 second epochs above the 95th 
percentile were labelled as artifacts and excluded. Note that results did not qualitatively 
change as a function of the chosen percentile (applying the 90th or 85th percentile as a 
threshold revealed similar results). Power spectra obtained from encoding and PVT were 
contrasted (encoding - PVT), yielding absolute power changes during encoding relative 
to the PVT.  
Significant frequency bins were defined based on the group statistics by applying a two-
sided cluster-based permutation test with 1000 randomisations (Maris & Oostenveld, 
2007). The topography for each participant was then derived by collapsing power values 
across the significant frequency bins for each channel separately resulting in a 1 x channel 
(=58) vector. 
Event Detection 
Sleep spindles and SOs were detected for each participant, based on established detection 
algorithms (Ngo et al., 2013; Staresina et al., 2015). Like wake data, sleep data were 

 
79 
down-sampled to 200 Hz, re-referenced to linked mastoids and filtered (high-pass: 0.3 
Hz, low-pass: 40 Hz). Bad channels were matched between wake and sleep data, excluded 
and interpolated. Finally, to identify and mark coarse artifacts, data were visually 
inspected. Channelwise event detection of both sleep spindles and slow oscillations were 
conducted on data from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep stages 2 and 3. Events 
were only included if free of artifacts between 1s before and 1s after the event.  
To detect fast sleep spindles, data were band-pass filtered between 12-15 Hz (4th order 
two-pass Butterworth filter). The envelope of the signal was calculated with a moving 
average of 200ms. An amplitude criterion (mean + 1.25*SD) was applied to the signal. 
Sleep spindles were detected when the signal exceeded the amplitude criterion for more 
than 0.5 but less than 3 seconds (duration criterion).  
The maximum of the envelope of each detected spindle was used as the amplitude 
measure. Duration was the time from beginning to end of each event and density was 
calculated as the number of detected events / total (artifact free) time spent in NREM 
sleep stage 2 and 3.  
To detect slow oscillations, data were band-pass filtered between 0.3-1.25 Hz (4th order 
two-pass Butterworth filter). Zero crossings were identified, and three criteria (duration 
criterion, trough to peak criterion and amplitude criterion) had to be fulfilled. The length 
criterion was met if one positive to negative crossing was followed by a second positive 
to negative crossing within a time window of 0.8 to 2 seconds. Based on all sufficiently 
long events, mean and standard deviation were calculated for trough to peak amplitudes 
as well as for absolute values of trough amplitudes. All events exceeding both means + 
1.25*SDs were considered slow oscillations.  

 
80 
The amplitude of SOs was defined as the most negative trough (downstate). To facilitate 
comparability between sleep measures, the absolute value of SO amplitudes was used. 
Thus, the downstate became positively scaled to match all other sleep measures. Duration 
was defined as the time between the first positive to negative and the following positive 
to negative crossing. Slow oscillation density was calculated by dividing the number of 
detected events by the total (artifact free) time spent in NREM sleep stages 2 and 3.  
Amplitude, duration and density of detected spindles and SOs were extracted per channel 
and averaged across events (amplitude, duration) resulting in 6 different 1 x channel (=58) 
vectors.  
Coupling of sleep spindles 
For each spindle event, the phase of the EEG trace filtered in the SO frequency band was 
extracted. To this end, the data around each spindle event were filtered from 0.3 – 1.25 
Hz. After applying a Hilbert transform, the instantaneous phase angle at the maximum of 
the envelope of each detected spindle was extracted.  
To compare spindles with higher vs. lower coupling, all spindle events per channel were 
classified based on their phase value. The 50% of spindle events with a phase value 
closest to 0 degrees were classified as spindles with a higher coupling. The remaining 
50% of spindle events were classified as spindles with a lower coupling.  
Comparison between encoding and sleep pattern 
For each participant, the 1x58 vector obtained from encoding was correlated (Spearman’s 
rho) with every 1x58 vector of the sleep characteristics (amplitude, duration and density 
for spindles and SOs). Correlations were then Fisher z-transformed for group statistics.

4.6. 
Statistics 
Correlation distributions between encoding and sleep topographies were tested with a 2 
(event type:   spindles   vs.   SOs) x 3 (event characteristic: amplitude, duration, density) 
repeated measures ANOVA. Paired sampled t-tests and one-sample t-tests were used for 
post-hoc comparisons.  
Partial correlations were conducted to test for mediating effects of spindle characteristics 
(e.g., spindle density) on the correlation between encoding and another spindle 
characteristic (e.g., spindle amplitude).   
To test for an association between sequence retention and the encoding-spindle overlap, 
the Spearman’s rho correlation was conducted. To rule out that the correlation with 
behaviour is solely driven by either sleep spindles or by encoding power, we applied a 
permutation approach and shuffled topographies between participants (1000 
permutations).  To obtain the observed correlation, we derived, for each participant, (i) 
behavioural performance, (ii) encoding topography and (iii) sleep spindle topography. By 
shuffling only one topography (encoding or sleep spindles) between participants while 
retaining the other participant-specific topography and behavioural performance, two null 
distributions were generated: First, a distribution under the null hypothesis that the 
participant-specific encoding topography is irrelevant for the correlation with behaviour 
(shuffling the encoding topographies). Second, a distribution under the null hypothesis 
that the participant-specific sleep spindle topography is irrelevant for the correlation with 
behaviour (shuffling the spindle topographies). The observed correlation was then tested 
against both null distributions.

Abstract 
Consolidation of memories relies on their reactivation during post-learning sleep. While 
most memories incorporate a sequential order of events, the timescale on which 
sequential events are reactivated during sleep in humans is still elusive. To identify and 
characterise reactivation of sequential memories, we here employed a sequential memory 
task and recorded high-density scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during a post-
learning nap. During the post-learning nap, we presented sounds associated with the 
encoded sequences (targeted memory reactivation, TMR) to induce sequential memory 
reactivation and applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to then capture 
reactivation. In response to the sequence-related sounds, we found reactivation of the first 
but not the second sequence element. Critically, when realigning the data to sound evoked 
slow oscillations, reactivation of the second sequence element was nested in their up-
states. Our results provide first evidence of sequential memory reactivation during sleep 
in humans and moreover, attribute the timing of sequential memory reactivation to slow 
oscillations.

1. Introduction 
How are memories consolidated during sleep? Memory reactivation, the re-occurrence of 
a neural pattern representing a memory trace, has been proposed as the mechanism for 
systems consolidation. Due to repeated reactivation, memory traces are redistributed from 
hippocampus to neocortex and hence, transformed from labile into stable representations 
(Born & Wilhelm, 2012; Diekelmann & Born, 2010; Klinzing et al., 2019). Evidence for 
reactivation during sleep as a mechanism for memory consolidation was provided by 
recent studies exploiting the development of new methods (e.g. representation similarity 
analysis, RSA and multivariate pattern analysis, MVPA, Grootswagers, Wardle, & 
Carlson, 2017; Kriegeskorte, 2008; Norman, Polyn, Detre, & Haxby, 2006) allowing to 
measure reactivation. That is, by applying RSA or MVPA to pre-sleep wake as well as 
sleep data, it was demonstrated that memory traces are reactivated during post-learning 
sleep and further, that the strength of reactivation predicted memory consolidation 
(Schreiner et al., 2018, 2021; Zhang et al., 2018). However, while these studies focused 
on paired associations, more naturalistic memories tend to incorporate a cascade of 
sequentially ordered events. The time scale on which sequentially ordered events are 
reactivated during sleep has yet to be explored.  
In rodents, sequential reactivation (replay) has been proposed to occur in a temporally 
compressed manner in both hippocampal and cortical areas (Ji & Wilson, 2007; Nádasdy 
et al., 1999; Skaggs & McNaughton, 1996). In humans, however, empirical evidence for 
sequential memory reactivation during sleep, to the best of our knowledge, is still lacking. 
One study demonstrated a re-occurrence of reactivation patterns in a 1 Hz rhythm 
indicating a timing of multiple reactivation patterns by slow oscillations (Schreiner et al., 

 
89 
2018). Slow oscillations are hypothesised to time simultaneous memory reactivation in 
hippocampal and neocortical areas to enable a redistribution of memory traces from 
hippocampus to neocortex (Rasch & Born, 2013). Whether sequential memory 
reactivation follows the rhythm of slow oscillations or whether it happens on a much 
faster time scale is still unknown.   
This study aims to assess the time scale of sequential memory reactivation during post-
learning sleep in humans. To this end, we employed a sequential memory task in which 
participants had to encode (object-)face-scene sequences whereas objects were always 
the cues and faces and scenes were always the targets (faces = first and scenes = second 
sequence element). To induce sequential reactivation of faces and scenes, sounds that 
were semantically related to the objects (sound cues) were played during subsequent sleep 
(targeted memory reactivation, TMR, Rudoy, Voss, Westerberg, & Paller, 2009; 
Schreiner & Rasch, 2015). Multivariate pattern analysis revealed reactivation of the first 
(faces) but not the second (scenes) sequence element in response to sound cues. 
Intriguingly, when realigning the data to slow oscillations evoked by sound cues, 
reactivation patterns of the second sequence element emerged. Our findings identify slow 
oscillations as the pacemaker for sequential memory reactivation during sleep.

2. Results 
2.1. 
Targeted reactivation of sequential memories increases memory 
performance 
We employed a sequential memory task in which participants associated an object 
(presented visually and auditorily) with two sequence elements presented in a fixed 
sequential order: a face and then a scene (Figure 1A). A fixed order was used as we 
wanted to increase the chances to detect sequential reactivation during sleep (see 
discussion). Memory for faces and scenes was assessed via a cued recall directly before 
sleep (retrieval 1, Figure 1A). Based on retrieval 1 performance, half of the correctly 
remembered face-scene sequences were assigned to a cued and the other half to a non-
cued condition. A face-scene sequence was correctly remembered when both the face and 
the scene were correct. Sound cues (semantically related with the objects) of face-scene 
sequences of the cued condition were then played during the following 2-hour nap 
(targeted memory reactivation, TMR, see Table S1 for descriptive data of sleep stages). 
Memory for faces and scenes was assessed again directly after the nap (retrieval 2) and 
the next morning following a full night of sleep at home (retrieval 3, Figure 1B).

Figure 4.1. Task and experimental design, behavioural results and localiser task. (A) 
During the localiser task, unfamous faces, scenes and objects (not used for the memory 
part) were presented in a randomised order. During encoding, sequences were presented 
which always started with an object (presented visually and auditorily) followed by one 
of two faces (Angelina Jolie, AJ or Barack Obama, BO) followed by one of two scenes 
(Westminster Abbey, WA or Machu Picchu, MP). A cued recall was used to assess 
memory performance (retrieval). A question mark was presented together with a sound 
cue (presenting an object auditorily). After 5 seconds, a legend asking for the correct face 
was shown which was then followed by a legend asking for the correct scene. (B) 
Participants performed the first localiser (loc1), encoding (E), training (T) and first 
retrieval (R1) before taking a 2-hour nap. While participants slept, sound cues were 
presented (targeted memory reactivation, TMR). Following the nap, a second retrieval 
(R2) and a second localiser (loc2) were conducted. Participants did a third retrieval (R3) 
the next morning. (C) During training (T), the probability to forget a face (fa) given that 
the scene (sc) was correctly remembered is significantly lower than the probability to 
forget a scene given that the face is correctly remembered. Density plots, group means 
with 95% CIs and single participant data are shown. ** = p < .01. (D) Memory 
performance of retrieval 3 (R3, proportion of R2 memory) is significantly higher for the 
cued compared to the non-cued condition. Density plots, group means with 95% CIs and 
single participant data are shown. * = p < .05. (E) Stimulus categories (faces vs. scenes) 

 
92 
could be classified based on the EEG localiser data from ~150ms post stimulus onset 
(dotted line, time = 0). The red line indicates significantly higher classification accuracies 
for the actual class labels (blue) compared to a distribution where class labels were 
shuffled (black).    
To test whether participants encoded faces and scenes in the correct sequential order, we 
calculated conditional probabilities for two different outcomes: First, we calculated the 
probability to forget a face given that the scene is correctly remembered (p(~face|scene)) 
and second, we calculated the probability that a scene is forgotten given that the face is 
correctly remembered (p(~scene|face)). We hypothesized that the first outcome 
(p(~face|scene)) is less likely if memories were encoded in the correct sequential order as 
forgetting the face interrupts the sequence and therefore, makes it more difficult to 
remember the scene. Indeed, we found a significantly lower probability for the first 
(p(~face|scene)) compared to the second (p(~scene|face)) outcome (t(18) = -2.99, p = 
.008). Conditional probabilities were calculated based on the training data (retrieval with 
feedback, see Figure 1B and methods). To obtain representative values for conditional 
probabilities of these two outcomes, enough trials of either just remembering the face or 
just remembering the scene are required. During retrieval 1, most trials were either 
completely correct (face and scene remembered) or incorrect (face and scene forgotten). 
Therefore, conditional probabilities were calculated based on the training data. Lower 
conditional probabilities for forgetting faces given that scenes are correctly remembered 
suggest that faces were, on average, encoded first (Figure 1C).  
Next, we turned to the question whether cueing during sleep results in greater memory 
performance. Memory performance was defined as the number of hits (correctly 
remembering both the face and the scene) and compared between cued and non-cued 

 
93 
sequences. Memory performance at retrieval 2 (proportion of retrieval 1 hits that were 
also remembered at retrieval 2) did not differ between cued and non-cued sequences 
(t(18) = -0.02, p = .987, see Figure S1). Interestingly and in line with previous findings 
(Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018), memory performance at retrieval 3 (proportion of 
retrieval 2 hits that were also remembered at retrieval 3) was superior for cued vs. non-
cued sequences (t(18) = 2.69, p = .015, Figure 1D) suggesting that the detection of TMR 
effects relies, at least partly, on overnight consolidation processes (see discussion).  
2.2. 
Sequence elements (faces and scenes) can be classified during the localiser 
task 
EEG data of the localiser task were used to extract neural patterns representing face vs. 
scene processing. This was done by training a classifier (linear discriminant analysis, 
LDA) on the EEG localiser data to differentiate between face and scene trials. Later, this 
classifier was applied to the EEG sleep data to search for the re-occurrence of category-
specific neural patterns in response to the sound cues (reactivation).  
During the localiser, faces and scenes, which were not shown during the memory part, 
were presented in a randomised order and participants had to identify the correct category 
(face, scene) of the presented image. As expected, participants performed the task with 
high accuracy (faces: meanacc = 99.5%, 95%CIacc = 0.48%; scenes: meanacc = 98.8%, 
95%CIacc = 1.15%). To extract category-specific neural patterns, a multivariate pattern 
analysis (MVPA) was conducted on the pooled localiser data from -0.2 pre- to 2 sec post-
stimulus. A fivefold cross-validation (train and test the classifier on the same task data, 
see methods) revealed a sustained above-chance classification starting at ~150ms post-
stimulus (p < .001 at each time point, cluster-corrected, Figure 1E). Therefore, based on 

 
94 
the localiser data, neural patterns representing the processing of face and scene images 
could be extracted.    
2.3. 
Targeted memory reactivation elicits reactivation of the 1st sequence 
element (faces) 
We hypothesised that the presentation of sound cues (objects) during sleep induce the 
sequential reactivation of faces and scenes. In other words, we tested whether category-
specific neural patterns, obtained from the localiser data, re-emerged in response to sound 
cues presented during sleep in the same order as they were encoded (faces = first sequence 
element, scenes = second sequence element). For this, we trained a classifier on each time 
point of the localiser data (0 to 2 sec) to extract neural patterns representing faces and 
scenes. We then applied the obtained classifier weights to each time point of the sleep 
data (-0.2 to 2.5 sec after sound cues, see Figure S2 for the time frequency decomposition 
and event-related potential). In the resulting localiser time x sleep time matrix, positive 
values reflect evidence for neural patterns representing face processing and negative 
values indicate evidence for neural patterns representing scene processing. As shown in 
Figure 2A (bottom), we indeed found a positive cluster in response to the sound 
presentation peaking at around 600 ms post-cue (corrected using a cluster-based 
permutation test, p = .016). While the sound presentation elicited a positive cluster 
indicating reactivation of face representations, no negative cluster reflecting reactivation 
of scene representations survived the correction for multiple comparisons (all negative 
clusters p > .253).

oscillations. (A) Top: The histogram shows how many down-states of evoked slow 
oscillations (number of events, frequencies) were detected at which time point across all 
participants (fixed-effects). Bottom: Face representations were classified ~600 ms after 
sound cues (dotted line = sound onset; white contour lines indicate the significant cluster 
when comparing the actual data vs. data with shuffled class labels, cluster-corrected, p < 
.05). Top: The histogram shows how many down-states of evoked slow oscillations were 
detected at which time point within a pre-defined detection time window (solid vertical 
lines, 0.2-1.5 sec post-cue, dotted line = sound cue onset) across all participants (fixed-
effects). Most down-states were detected ~800ms after sound cues but the variation across 
the whole detection time window was high. (B) Top: Grand average of detected slow 
oscillations evoked by sound cues (mean ± SEM). Bottom: Scene representations were 
classified ~600 ms after down-states of evoked slow oscillations (dotted line = down-
state, white contour lines indicate the significant cluster when comparing the actual data 
vs. data with shuffled class labels, cluster-corrected, p < .05).  
However, we assumed that slow oscillations might time the reactivation of sequential 
memories. Thus, in a next step, we detected slow oscillations evoked by the sound cues 
and tested for reactivation of category-specific patterns in relation to their down-state.  
 

 
96 
2.4. 
Evoked slow oscillations synchronise reactivation of the 2nd sequence 
element (scenes) 
Slow oscillations were detected in a pre-defined time window between 0.2 – 1.5 seconds 
after sound presentation (‘evoked slow oscillations’, see Table S2 for the number of 
detected slow oscillations relative to sound cues). We applied such a narrow detection 
window to ensure that detected slow oscillations were induced by the sound cues and 
thus, were related to the cued sequences. Nonetheless, extending the detection window to 
2 sec did not qualitatively change the results.  
To directly test whether reactivation of scene representations is indeed paced by evoked 
slow oscillations, we realigned the data according to the down-state of evoked slow 
oscillations and re-run the previously described classification analysis. In short, we again 
trained a classifier on each time point of the localiser data, but this time applied the 
classifier weights to each time point of the sleep data around the downstate of evoked 
slow oscillations (-1.5 to 1.5 sec with 0 being the down-state of evoked slow oscillations). 
The resulting localiser time x sleep time matrix revealed a significant negative cluster 
peaking at around 600 ms after the down-state (corrected using a cluster-based 
permutation test, p = .042), whereas no positive cluster reached significance after 
correction (all positive clusters p > .848). The significant negative cluster indicates 
reactivation of scene representations which is nested in the up-state of evoked slow 
oscillations.  
Even though slow oscillations were detected in such a narrow time window (0.2 to 1.5 
sec), the timing of evoked slow oscillations varied on a trial-by trial basis. More precisely, 
down-states were, on average, detected after 0.84 sec after sound onset but varied across 

 
97 
the whole detection window (std = 0.32, see Figure 2A top). The findings that no scene 
reactivation can be found in response to sound cues, but that scene evidence is then timed 
by evoked slow oscillations can be reconciled by such a variation of evoked slow 
oscillations. That is, if reactivation of scene representations is paced by slow oscillations 
and moreover, slow oscillations vary in response to sound cues, reactivation patterns of 
scene representations would be concealed in averaging the sound-locked data and this is 
what we see in Figure 2A.  
Together, our results suggest that slow oscillations evoked by sound cues time 
reactivation of sequential memories.  
3. Discussion 
In our study, TMR combined with MVPA were used to assess reactivation of sequential 
memories during post-learning sleep. After confirming that participants encoded 
sequences in a sequential order (Figure 1C), we found superior memory performance for 
cued compared to non-cued sequences (Figure 1D). When applying MVPA to the sound 
cues presented during sleep, reactivation of the first but not the second sequence element 
was revealed (Figure 2A). Critically, when realigning the sleep data to sound evoked slow 
oscillations, reactivation of the second sequence element emerged during the up-state of 
slow oscillations (Figure 2B).  
It has been assumed that reactivation of memories is induced by presenting associated 
sound cues during sleep (TMR). This assumption is based on behavioural as well as 
physiological findings. Behavioural findings demonstrating superior memory 

 
98 
performance for cued compared to non-cued items, as we do in our study as well, suggest 
memory reactivation in response to sound cues. Accordingly, superior memory 
performance for cued items can be explained, in theory, by cued items being constantly 
reactivated and therefore consolidated (Rudoy et al., 2009; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015; for 
a review see Oudiette & Paller, 2013 ; for a meta-analysis see Hu, Cheng, Chiu, & Paller, 
2020).  
Besides behavioural findings, recent studies also demonstrate physiological changes in 
response to sound cues. In response to sound cues (previously associated with learning 
content) evoked slow oscillations show a higher amplitude and spindle power compared 
to sound cues without any previously learned association (Laventure et al., 2018; 
Schreiner et al., 2015; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015). Moreover, learning content previously 
associated with the sound cues could be decoded when a classifier was trained and tested 
on sleep data locked to sound cues (Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). 
Based on these physiological findings, we were interested in directly testing for 
reactivation in response to sound cues. As reactivation of memories entails the re-
emergence of neural patterns during post-learning sleep which were activated during 
wakefulness, we trained a classifier on wake data to extracted category-specific neural 
patterns. When testing the classifier on sleep data, we found direct evidence for memory 
reactivation in response to sound cues after ~600ms. This finding aligns nicely with 
another study demonstrating evidence for memory reactivation in response to sound cues 
after ~400ms (Schreiner et al., 2018). Interestingly, Schreiner and colleagues (2018) 
found a re-occurrence of memory reactivation ~1 sec after the first reactivation pattern, 
indicating a timing by slow oscillatory activity. Corresponding to their interpretation, we 
found in our study that the reactivation pattern of the second sequence element was nested 

 
99 
in the up-state of evoked slow oscillations, arguing for a timing of reactivation by slow 
oscillations. 
It is worth considering that evidence for face reactivation was not observed when 
realigning the data to evoked SOs (Figure 2B). This suggests that reactivation of the first 
element in a sequence (i.e., the face) was directly induced by the sound cue, whereas 
reactivation of the second item in a sequence (i.e., the scene) was then timed by slow 
oscillations after the sound cue. A recent rodent study proposed that information 
processing in response to sound cues during sleep follows a cortical-hippocampal-cortical 
loop (Rothschild et al., 2017). More precisely, the presentation of sound cues during sleep 
biased auditory cortical activity which then predicted hippocampal reactivation during 
sharp-wave ripples. Hippocampal activity, in return, drove reactivation in the auditory 
cortex and hence, closed the information processing loop. Applying this loop to our 
results, one could speculate that sound cues reactivate cortical areas representing the first 
sequence element which then drives hippocampal reactivation of the second sequence 
element during sharp-wave ripples. Hippocampal together with cortical reactivation is 
synchronised by evoked slow oscillations and nested in their up-states. Thus, variations 
in the temporal coordination of the cortico-hippocampal-cortical loop might have 
obscured the decoding of the second sequence item when locking the data to the sound 
cues and the decoding of the first sequence item when realigning the data to the evoked 
slow oscillations. However, due to the limited spatial resolution of scalp EEG, the 
involvement of hippocampal activity and sharp wave-ripples for reactivating sequential 
memories in our study remains elusive. Future research may unify methods suitable to 
record and detect hippocampal sharp-wave ripples with sequential memory paradigms to 
gain insights into the interplay between hippocampal and cortical reactivation. Similarly, 

 
100 
we cannot draw any conclusions about the meaning of sleep spindles in our paradigm. It 
has been shown that TMR cues elicit evoked slow oscillations which are accompanied by 
an increase in spindle power during their up-states (Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018; Göldi 
et al., 2019; Oyarzún et al., 2017; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015). A precise nesting of sleep 
spindles in slow oscillations up-states is predictive for memory consolidation (Helfrich et 
al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019) and memory reactivation (Schreiner et al., 2021). 
Consequently, the reactivation of scene evidence which is reported in our study might be 
also modulated by a coupling of slow oscillations and spindles rather than slow 
oscillations alone. Owing to a low number of spindles evoked by the sound cues, we 
cannot address this question here, and it remains open for future research.  
A low number of evoked spindles, however, may explain that a full night of sleep in this 
study was required to unfold the benefits of cueing on memory consolidation (Figure 1D). 
Sleep spindles induce synaptic plasticity (Niethard et al., 2018; Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005; 
Seibt et al., 2017; Sejnowski & Destexhe, 2000) and hence, lead to long-lasting changes 
presumably in cortical networks representing memory traces. A low number of spindles 
evoked by the sound cues may not be sufficient to induce synaptic plasticity to such an 
extent that it is expressed in behavioural findings directly after the nap. It might be enough 
though to preserve the cued memories so that they can be further consolidated during a 
following night. Whether and how sleep spindles can preserve memories for a later 
consolidation is yet unknown and requires further investigation.  
Apart from a low number of evoked spindles, there are additional limitations in the 
present study. To increase the chances to detect sequential reactivation during post-
learning sleep, we presented the sequence elements in a fixed order (the face was always 
the first and the scene was always the second sequence element). Randomising the 

 
101 
sequence order within or across participants might result in a mental restructure of the 
sequence order by participants to make the task easier. That is, learning a face followed 
by a scene is potentially easier than learning a scene followed by a face as the former 
aligns with our sentence structure and grammar (a person does something somewhere). 
As mentally restructuring the sequence order obscure the decoding of the actual sequence 
order, a fixed sequence (face-scene) was presented.  
To rule out that the decoding results (increased classifier accuracy for the face category 
which is followed by increased classifier accuracy for the scene category) accidentally 
emerge whenever a sound is presented (independently of whether the sound was 
previously associated with a face-scene sequence), we incorporated control sounds in our 
task design. Control sounds seem not to elicit such an order in classifier accuracies 
(increased face and then scene classifier accuracies, results are not shown).   
It is worth noting that the first sequence element (face) is remembered more frequently 
than the second sequence element (scene). As previous studies argue that weakly memory 
traces tend to be more consolidated, i.e., more reactivated, than stronger one (Denis, 
Mylonas, et al., 2020; Denis, Schapiro, Poskanzer, Bursal, Charon, et al., 2020; but see 
Petzka et al., 2021, chapter 2), an imbalance in memory performance between both 
sequence elements might be reflected in a difference between classifier accuracies of both 
sequence elements. However, as we are specifically interested in the order rather than in 
the magnitude of classifier accuracies, potential differences can be neglected.  
In sum, our results demonstrate reactivation of sequential memories in response to sound 
cues which are moreover synchronised by slow oscillations. Our results not only provide 
mechanistic evidence for behavioural TMR findings but also shed light on the role of 
slow oscillations for sequential memory reactivation.

4. Methods 
The presented data in this paper are a subset of a larger data set. This larger data set also 
include a wake group (between-subjects). The data of the wake group were collected in 
parallel to the presented data of the sleep group. However, as the results of the paper 
exclusively focuses on the sleep group, information about the wake group is not reported.   
4.1. 
Participants 
37 participants were tested. 18 participants had to be excluded due to the following 
reasons: less than one round of cueing (n = 9), technical issues (n = 4), did not reach the 
training threshold (n = 3), cancelled due to other issues (participant had a headache n = 
1, fire alarm went off during nap n = 1). 19 participants were included in the final sample 
(meanage = 20.3, rangeage = 19-23, female = 12). For the final analysis (Figure 2B), another 
participant had to be excluded as the number of evoked slow oscillations was too low (n 
evoked slow oscillations = 3). The sample size aligns with previous human sleep and 
memory studies (Helfrich et al., 2018; Ngo et al., 2015).  
Pre-screening ensured that participants had no history of neurological or psychiatric 
disorders and a normal sleep-wake cycle throughout the experiment. On the day of the 
experiment, participants were instructed to get up one hour earlier than normal and avoid 
caffeine. Moreover, they had to abstain from alcohol the night before. Participants 
received a monetary reimbursement after participating in the study. Written informed 
consent was obtained from all participants before the start of the study. The study was 
approved by the University of Birmingham Research Ethics and Governance Committee.

4.2. 
Paradigm and procedure 
All tasks were implemented via custom written scripts in MATLAB 2016a (MathWorks, 
Munich, Germany) using functions of the PsychoPhysics Toolbox Version 3.0.14 
(Brainard, 1997). The description of the tasks follows the order in which they were 
conducted in the experimental sessions.  
Localiser  
150 objects, unfamiliar faces and scenes were presented in a randomised order. The 
localiser was conducted to later classify brain activity according to these categories. Each 
trial started with a fixation cross presented for 2 ± 0.1 sec in the centre of the screen. One 
of 150 stimuli (either an object, face or scene) was then shown for 2 sec. After 2 sec, a 
legend appeared below the stimulus prompting participants to indicate with a key press 
which category the stimulus belongs to.  
The localiser was conducted twice, at the beginning and end of the first experimental 
session. While the structure of the task was identical, different objects, faces and scenes 
were used.  
Familiarisation 
During the familiarisation, 90 objects accompanied by a semantically related sound were 
presented twice, e.g., a cat together with a “meow”. The same 90 objects acted as cues 
for the 90 sequences that had to be associated during the following encoding. The purpose 
was to strengthen the connection between the object and sound. Each trial started with a 
centred fixation cross presented for 2 ± 0.1 sec. Afterwards, an object was presented for 
2 sec. The semantically related sound was played twice for 500ms, at the beginning (0 – 
500ms) and end (1500 – 2000 ms) of the object presentation. After 2 sec, a legend 

 
104 
appeared below the object inviting participants to listen to the sound again or to continue 
with the next trial. Participants were free to listen to the sounds as often as they wanted 
to.  
Encoding 
Participants had to encode 90 sequences comprising an object as a cue and a face and a 
scene as a target. Each trial started with a centred fixation cross presented for 3 ± 0.1 sec. 
A trial unique object was then presented for 2 sec which was accompanied by a 
semantically related sound (0.5 sec). For example, the image of a guitar was accompanied 
by the sound of a playing guitar. These were the same objects presented during the 
familiarisation. To signify the continuity of the sequence, a centred fixation cross together 
with three dots was shown for 2 ± 0.1 sec, followed by the first target of the sequence, 
the face. The face was either Angelina Jolie or Barack Obama and was on the screen for 
2 sec. After the face, the fixation cross together with three dots were again presented for 
2 ± 0.1 sec, followed by the second target of the sequence, the scene. The scene was either 
Machu Picchu or the inside of the Westminster Abbey. Angelina Jolie/Barack Obama and 
Machu Picchu/Westminster Abbey respectively were used as targets as they were familiar 
to all participants and consequently, facilitate the feasibility of the cued recall.  
During encoding, participants had to create a short story connecting the object with the 
face and scene. Importantly, they had to stick to the order in which the sequence was 
presented. After the scene was shown on the screen for 2 sec, a legend additionally 
occurred below the scene requesting participants to indicate via button press whether they 
were successful in creating a mental story. On button press the next trial started.    
          

 
105 
Training 
A training session was introduced to ensure an appropriate number of hits for a later 
allocation to a cued vs. not-cued condition (see section Nap & Targeted memory 
reactivation). Each training trial started with a centred fixation cross for 3 ± 0.1 sec, 
followed by the visual and auditorily presentation of the object for 0.5 sec. A question 
mark then appeared on the screen indicating the retrieval of the face and scene. After 4.5 
sec, a legend was shown and participants had to indicate first, the face and second, the 
scene the object was presented with. They always had the choice to respond with “don’t 
know”. Whenever participants did a mistake or chose the “don’t know” response for at 
least one of the two targets, the whole sequence was presented again.      
Participants finished the training when they correctly remembered 75 out of the 90 
encoded sequences. Memory performance was assessed in respect to the training 
threshold when all 90 sequences were tested. If the training threshold was not reached, 
not remembered sequences were tested again. After each trial, memory performance was 
assessed again and the training finished as soon as the training threshold was reached.     
Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) 
To assess the vigilance of participants, a PVT was used. A centred fixation cross was 
presented for 6 ± 4 sec. Whenever a counter replaced the fixation cross, participants had 
to press the space bar as fast as possible to stop the counter. Following the key press, 
feedback about the reaction time was provided. Overall, the PVT lasted 2 minutes.  
Retrieval  
Each retrieval trial started with a centred fixation cross presented for 2 ± 0.1 sec. After 
the fixation cross, the object related sound was presented for 0.5 sec, followed by a 

 
106 
question mark (4.5 sec) which prompted participants to retrieve the associated face and 
scene. Then, a legend appeared and participants had to indicate first, which face and 
second, which scene the object was presented with. In both cases, participants could also 
choose a “don’t know” or “don’t recognise the sound” option. A trial was counted as a 
hit when both face as well as scene were correct.   
Nap & Targeted memory reactivation 
Between retrieval and nap, participants had a light lunch (sandwich).  At ~2 p.m. they 
went to the laboratory bedroom for 120 min. They had the opportunity to sleep while their 
brain, muscle and eye activity was recorded with polysomnography (PSG).  
During late sleep stage 2 and early sleep stage 3, the presentation of object sounds was 
initiated (targeted memory reactivation, TMR). Based on memory performance at 
retrieval 1, correctly remembered sequences were divided into a cued and non-cued 
condition. This way, baseline memory performance was equal between cued and non-
cued sequences. For example, if 30 sequences were correctly remembered (face as well 
as scene had to be correct), 15 sequences were assigned to the cued and the other 15 were 
assigned to the non-cued condition. Whenever an odd number of sequences was correctly 
remembered, the remaining sequence was randomly assigned to one of the two 
conditions. In addition to the object sounds, the same amount of control sounds was 
presented. Referring to our example, in addition to the 15 object sounds from the cued 
condition, 15 control sounds were presented. Control sounds were generated by shuffling 
the power spectrum of the real sounds in the frequency domain and thus, resembled noise. 
Object and control sounds were presented (~30dB) in a randomised order with an inter-
stimulus interval of 5 sec. After one round of cueing, the presentation order was shuffled 
and the cueing continued.  

 
107 
Procedure 
The experiment consisted of two experimental sessions. The first session started at 11 am 
with the application of electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG) and 
electromyography (EMG). Approximately one hour later, participants were given written 
instructions and the opportunity to practice each task. Following the practice, the actual 
tasks including localiser, familiarisation, encoding, training, PVT and retrieval 1 were 
conducted.  
Participants then went to bed at ~ 2 pm to take a 2-hour nap (see Table S1 for descriptive 
sleep data). 30 min after waking up, participants continued with a second PVT, retrieval 
2 and the second localiser. The following day at 11 am, participants returned to the lab 
for the second experimental session comprising a third retrieval (without EEG).  
4.3. 
EEG data recording 
EEG data were recorded using a Brain Products 64-channel EEG system and sampled at 
1000 Hz. Electrodes were arranged according to the 10-20 system (including FCz as 
reference, AFz as ground and left and right mastoids). To record muscle activity 
(electromyography, EMG) and eye movements (electrooculography, EOG), two 
electrodes were placed on the chin and two electrodes around the eye.  
4.4. 
Behavioural analysis 
Conditional probabilities for two different outcomes were calculated based on the training 
data: First, we calculated the probability of forgetting a face given that the scene is 
correctly remembered (p(~face|scene) = p(~faceÇscene) / p(scene)) and second, we 
calculated the probability of forgetting a scene given that the face is correctly remembered 

 
108 
(p(~scene|face) = p(~sceneÇface) / p(face)). To obtain representative values for 
conditional probabilities of these two outcomes, enough trials of either just remembering 
the face or just remembering the scene are required. During retrieval 1, most trials were 
either completely correct (face and scene remembered) or incorrect (face and scene 
forgotten). Therefore, conditional probabilities were calculated based on the training data.  
Memory performance at retrieval 2 was calculated as the proportion of hits at retrieval 1 
which were correctly remembered at retrieval 2. Memory performance at retrieval 3 was 
calculated as the proportion of hits at retrieval 2 that were correctly remembered at 
retrieval 3. A trial counted as a hit trial when face and scene were correctly remembered.   
For all behavioural analyses paired-sample t-tests were used to test for statistical 
differences between conditions.  
4.5. 
EEG analysis 
Preprocessing 
Preprocessing of EEG data was performed using the FieldTrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 
2011). To remove eye movements from the wake data, an independent component 
analysis (ICA) was applied. Data were down-sampled to 200 Hz, filtered (high-pass: 1 
Hz, low-pass: 100 Hz, band-stop: 48-52 Hz), demeaned and inspected for coarse artifacts. 
Bad channels were discharged before applying the ICA to identify bad components and 
obtain the unmixing matrix. The raw data were then preprocessed again because the first 
preprocessing was optimised for applying the ICA. Data were down-sampled to 500 Hz, 
filtered (low-pass: 200 Hz, band-stop: 48-52, 98-102, 148-152 Hz) and demeaned. The 
previously defined bad channels were excluded and the unmixing matrix was applied to 

 
109 
the new data. Bad components were removed, bad channels were interpolated, and data 
were re-referenced to common average.      
According to the wake data, sleep data were down-sampled to 500 Hz, filtered (low-pass: 
200 Hz, band-stop: 48-52, 98-102, 148-152 Hz) and demeaned. Bad channels were 
interpolated, and data were re-referenced to common average.    
Multivariate analysis 
Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was conducted using the MVPA-light toolbox 
(Treder, 2020) running in MATLAB. As a classifier a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) 
was used (Lemm et al., 2011).    
Before applying the LDA to the localiser data, data were segmented ([-0.2 – 2 sec post-
stimulus]), smoothed in time with a running average time window of 50ms and baseline 
corrected (-0.2 to 0 sec). Then, a z-transformation across trials was applied to each time 
point. On each time point of the z-transformed data, a classifier was trained with all 58 
channels serving as features and face and scene trials serving as the two classes. To avoid 
overfitting, data (trials) were divided into a training and test set using fivefold cross-
validation (Lemm et al., 2011). Cross-validation was repeated five times and averaged, 
since the assignment of trials into training and test set was random. To operationalise the 
ability of the classifier to differentiate between face and scene classes, the accuracy metric 
was used. Accuracy can be interpreted in such a way that 0.5 reflects random and 1.0 
reflects perfect performance. For example, 0.5 accuracy means that 50% of all tested face 
trials are assigned to the class face and the other 50% of tested face trials are assigned to 
the class scene. Consequently, the classifier cannot distinguish between face and scene 
trials. Accuracy of 1, on the other side, means that all tested face trials are correctly 

 
110 
assigned to the class face reflecting a perfect differentiation between trials. For statistical 
comparisons, decoding performance was calculated again but this time with shuffled class 
labels (faces and scenes).   
To investigate evidence for face and scene representations during sleep, the temporal 
generalization method was used (King & Dehaene, 2014). Before, localiser and sleep data 
were segmented, smoothed with a running average time window of 200ms and a z-
transformation on each time point across trials was applied. The classifier was now 
trained on each time point of the localiser data and tested on each time point of the sleep 
data resulting in a time x time matrix. As localiser and sleep data were independent data 
sets, no cross-validation was required. As a metric for classification, we used accuracy 
([0-1]) and subtracted the chance performance (0.5). However, since both classes, faces 
and scenes, were components of all testing trials, we labelled all testing trials as face 
trials. Consequently, the accuracy measurement has to be interpreted differently. That is, 
above chance classification (positive values, [0.01-0.5]) can be interpreted as face 
evidence, whereas below chance classification (negative values, [-0.5- -0.01]) indicates 
scene evidence. For statistical comparisons, the same analysis was conducted 10 times 
with shuffled class labels (faces and scenes) of the localiser data. The 10 resulting time x 
time matrices were averaged and provide values under the null hypothesis.  
Event Detection 
To detect evoked slow oscillations for each participant, established detection algorithms 
were applied (Ngo et al., 2013; Staresina et al., 2015). Data classified as N2 or N3 sleep 
were band-pass filtered between 0.3-1.25 Hz (4th order two-pass Butterworth filter) and 
zero crossings were detected. For slow oscillations, three criteria had to be fulfilled: A 
length criterion, a peak to trough criterion and an amplitude criterion. The length criterion 

 
111 
was met, if a positive to negative crossing was followed by a second positive to negative 
crossing within 0.8 to 2 sec. Based on all sufficiently long events, mean and standard 
deviation (std) were calculated for trough to peak amplitudes as well as for absolute 
values of trough amplitudes. The peak to trough criterion and the amplitude criterion were 
fulfilled, if events exceed the mean + 1.25*std. Then, evoked slow oscillations were 
identified on electrode position Fz whenever a sound cue was presented 0.2 to 1.5 seconds 
before the trough (down-state). Sleep data were realigned to the down-state of evoked 
slow oscillations (time = 0).   
Statistics 
Paired sampled t-tests were used to test for behavioural differences between conditions 
(Figure 1 C, D).  
To correct for multiple comparisons, FieldTrip’s cluster-based permutation test (Maris & 
Oostenveld, 2007) was applied (1000 randomisations) to compare classifier accuracies 
between real and shuffled labels across time (Figure 1 E). Furthermore, a permutation test 
was conducted to compare time x time classification matrices (real vs. shuffled labels, 
Figure 2). All cluster-based permutation tests were two-sided.

Abstract 
Sleep is thought to support memory consolidation via reactivation of prior experiences, 
with particular electrophysiological sleep signatures (slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep 
spindles) gating the information flow between relevant brain areas. However, empirical 
evidence for a role of endogenous memory reactivation (i.e., without experimentally 
delivered memory cues) for consolidation in humans is lacking. Here, we devised a 
paradigm in which participants acquired associative memories before taking a nap. 
Multivariate decoding was then used to capture endogenous memory reactivation during 
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in surface EEG recordings. Our results reveal 
reactivation of learning material during SO-spindle complexes, with the precision of SO-
spindle coupling predicting reactivation strength. Critically, reactivation strength (i.e. 
classifier evidence in favour of the previously studied stimulus category) in turn predicts 
the level of consolidation across participants. These results elucidate the memory function 
of sleep in humans and emphasize the importance of SOs and spindles in clocking 
endogenous consolidation processes.

1. Introduction 
How do we strengthen memories while we sleep? The prime vehicle of systems 
consolidation is thought to be the reactivation of information encoded during prior 
wakefulness (Diekelmann & Born, 2010; Paller et al., 2021; Rasch & Born, 2013; Walker 
& Stickgold, 2004). Through reactivation, memory representations are relayed between 
the hippocampus and neocortical long-term stores, transforming initially labile 
representations into long-lasting memories during sleep (Buzsáki, 1996; Marr, 1971). The 
communication between the hippocampus and neocortical networks is thought to be 
facilitated by an intricate interplay of the cardinal NREM sleep-related oscillations, 
namely cortical slow oscillations (SOs), thalamo-cortical sleep spindles, and hippocampal 
sharp-wave ripples (Latchoumane et al., 2017; Maingret et al., 2016; Oyanedel et al., 
2020; Sirota et al., 2003; Skelin et al., 2019; Staresina et al., 2015). SOs reflect 
fluctuations of the membrane potential and orchestrate transitions from neuronal silence 
(hyperpolarization, i.e., downstate) to neuronal excitation (depolarization, i.e., upstate, 
Amzica & Steriade, 2002; Steriade et al., 1993). Importantly, they initiate time windows 
of excitability and inhibition not only in cortical but also in subcortical areas (Fernandez 
& Lüthi, 2020a; Isomura et al., 2006; Timofeev, 2011). They trigger the emergence of 
sleep spindles in the thalamus (Mak-Mccully et al., 2017), which nest in the excitable up-
states of the SOs. Spindles have been shown to gate Ca2+ influx into dendrites, thereby 
facilitating synaptic plasticity (Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005; Seibt et al., 2017). Importantly, 
recent evidence from two-photon imaging in mice suggests that Ca2+ influx is strongly 
amplified when spindles coincide with SO up-states (Niethard et al., 2018). Lastly, 
hippocampal ripples are transient network oscillations and have been closely linked to 
reactivation/replay of learning experiences (Buzsáki, 2015; Joo & Frank, 2018). They 

 
118 
have been shown to occur in the excitable troughs of the spindle, suggesting that spindles 
might facilitate information transfer from the hippocampus to neocortical target sites 
(Helfrich et al., 2019; Ngo et al., 2020). The efficacy of systems consolidation through 
memory reactivation might thus hinge on concurrent SO-spindle coupling, ensuring 
optimal conditions to ignite structural changes in cortical target sites (Clemens et al., 
2007; Jiang, Gonzalez-Martinez, & Halgren, 2019; Oyanedel et al., 2020; Staresina et al., 
2015). 
Indeed, recent work in humans has revealed a key role of SO-spindle coupling during 
NREM sleep for behavioural expressions of consolidation. For instance, the precision of 
SO-spindle coupling, i.e., the exact timing of spindle maxima with respect to the SO 
upstate, has been shown to correlate with retention of declarative learning material 
(Mikutta et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). Moreover, levels of SO-spindle coupling track 
the rise and decline of memory performance across development (Hahn et al., 2020; 
Helfrich et al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019). What is unknown, however, is whether there 
is a link between SO-spindle coupling and physiological expressions of consolidation, 
i.e., memory reactivation. A recent rodent study revealed that precise SO-spindle 
coupling is key for maintaining the reactivation of neural ensembles (Kim et al., 2019), 
but whether and how this relates to episodic memory consolidation in humans is unclear. 
In humans, the study of memory reactivation during sleep has mainly relied on targeted 
memory reactivation (TMR) protocols (Oudiette & Paller, 2013; Schreiner & Staudigl, 
2020). This experimental technique follows the rationale that reminder cues are presented 
during sleep to exogenously trigger memory reactivation. Intriguingly, presenting 
auditory reminder cues during NREM sleep reliably induces SO-spindle complexes 
(Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018; Oyarzún et al., 2017; Schreiner et al., 2015). However, 

 
119 
to what extent TMR-induced processes reflect natural/endogenous consolidation 
processes remains unknown. 
Building on the work summarized above, we propose that SO-spindle complexes might 
clock endogenous memory reactivation in service of consolidation during human sleep. 
To test this notion, we devised an experimental paradigm in which participants acquired 
associative memories before taking a nap. Multivariate decoding was then used to assess 
endogenous memory reactivation during NREM sleep. In this work, we show that 
memory reactivation is specifically bound to the presence of SO-spindle complexes, with 
the precision of their coupling correlating with reactivation strength. Reactivation 
strength in turn predicts the extent of consolidation across participants. These findings 
elucidate the memory function of sleep in humans and illustrate the importance of SO-
spindle coupling for clocking endogenous consolidation processes. 
2. Results 
Twenty participants (age: 20.75 ± 0.35; 17 female) took part in two experimental 
sessions. In both sessions they performed an episodic learning task, with memory 
performance being assessed before and after taking a 120 min nap (Figure 1A). 
Depending on the experimental session, participants learned to associate verbs with 
images of objects or scenes during the pre-sleep learning phase. These stimulus categories 
were chosen as they recruit distinctive brain networks (e.g., lateral occipital complex for 
objects, parahippocampal place area for scenes (Epstein & Kanwisher, 1998; Malach et 
al., 1995), thus facilitating the analytical readout of endogenous, experience-dependent 
memory reactivation during sleep. Specifically, learning-related memory reactivation 

 
120 
during sleep would manifest as enhanced representational evidence for the stimulus 
category learned before sleep (i.e., greater evidence for object representations after word-
object encoding and greater evidence for scene representations after word-scene 
encoding, respectively).

encoding, participants were presented with 120 verb-object or verb-scene combinations

which they processed a new set of object and scene images. (b) Behavioural results for

chance) from the localizer EEG data, starting around 150 ms post stimulus onset (the 
black solid line indicates decoding performance (±SEM)). The horizontal dashed line 
indicates surrogate decoding performance, which was estimated by shuffling the training 
labels 250 times. The vertical solid line indicates stimulus onset (time = 0). The lower 
horizontal gray line shows the temporal extent of significant decoding results as derived 
from a dependent-samples t-test (two-sided, p = 0.002, cluster corrected across time).  
Memory performance was tested both before and after the sleep period in a stepwise 
manner. First, participants made word-recognition judgments (old or new). Then, for 
recognized words only, recall of the associated image exemplar (object or scene, 
depending on experimental session) was assessed. The resulting recall performance was 
then normalized by the amount of correctly recognized items (i.e., “hits”). To avoid any 
impact of pre-sleep testing on our behavioural consolidation measures (Antony et al., 
2017; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006), only half of the learned material was tested before 
sleep, while the remaining half was tested after sleep. Finally, at the end of the 
experimental sessions participants performed an independent “localizer task”, where a 
new set of object and scene images was presented (including both stimulus categories, 
irrespective of experimental session). This localizer served to train a linear classifier to 
distinguish object- vs. scene-related electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns. 
2.1. 
Behavioural results and category classification during the localizer task 
First, we calculated d-prime (d′, Macmillan & Creelman, 2005) as a general measure of 
recognition memory performance (for a detailed overview of memory measures as well 
as sleep characteristics see Tables S 1 and S 2). Both pre- and post-sleep d′ levels 
confirmed that participants could reliably discriminate between old and new items (i.e., 
d′ > 0; pre-sleep objects: d′ = 2.11 ± 0.14, scenes: d′ = 2.02 ± 0.22; post-sleep objects: 

 
122 
d′ = 1.76 ± 0.19, scenes: d′ = 1.69 ± 0.23). Out of hits, participants recalled the correct 
image for 64.31 ± 3.23% before sleep (objects: 64.90 ± 3.99%, scenes: 63.72 ± 5.20%) 
and for 57.61 ± 3.91% after sleep (objects: 59.39 ± 5.71%, scenes: 55.82 ± 5.47%). 
To test for potential differences in memory performance between test times and stimulus 
categories, we conducted ANOVAs for recognition memory (d′) and cued recall, 
including the factors category (object vs. scene) and test-time (pre- vs. post-sleep). 
Results indicated that memory performance (both recognition and recall) declined over 
the course of sleep (main factor test-time: recognition memory: F1,19 = 10.91; p = 0.004; 
cued recall: F1,19 = 15.53; p = 0.001). Importantly though, no difference in memory 
performance between categories was observable (main effect category: recognition 
memory: F1,19 = 0.21; p = 0.65; cued recall: F1,19 = 0.38; p = 0.54) and no interaction 
between test-time and learning category (recognition memory: F1,19 = 0.003; p = 0.95; 
associative memory: F1,19 = 0.69; p = 0.41), ensuring that task difficulty was highly 
comparable between image categories (also see Table S1). 
The localizer task at the end of each session was employed to derive the neural signatures 
of object vs. scene processing, which were then used to track category-specific memory 
reactivation during NREM sleep (see below). Participants were presented with novel sets 
of object and scene images and performed a continuous recognition task on these images. 
Specifically, each image was presented twice (mean distance between successive 
presentations = 8.06, range = 2–33) and participants were instructed to indicate whether a 
given item was “new” (first presentation) or “old” (second presentation). As expected, 
participants showed high accuracy levels on this task (objects: 97.02 ± 0.61 correct 

 
123 
decisions; scenes: 92.57 ± 4.44 correct decisions), with performance again matched 
between image categories (t(19) = 1.05, p = 0.31). 
To extract the category-specific (i.e., object and scene) patterns of neuronal activity, we 
pooled the localizer data across experimental sessions and performed multivariate 
classification (linear discriminant analysis; LDA) on these data (Figure 1c). Using 
fivefold cross-validation (see Methods), above-chance classification accuracy emerged 
around 150 ms following image onset, was sustained until 2800 ms and peaked at 600 ms 
(p = 0.002, corrected for multiple comparisons across time). Hence, the localizer data 
allowed us to isolate brain patterns associated with the processing of object and scene 
images, which we then used to guide analysis of category-specific reactivation during 
sleep (for results concerning the stability of the decoding approach see Figure S 1). 
2.2. 
Endogenous memory reactivation during NREM sleep is clocked by SO-
spindle complexes 
As mentioned above, theoretical models and recent empirical findings point to particular 
role of SO-spindle coupling for memory consolidation. We thus tested the resulting 
prediction that the joint presence of SOs and sleep spindles (henceforth referred to as 
“SO-spindle complexes”) would drive endogenous memory reactivation during human 
sleep. SOs and sleep spindles were detected in the EEG data using established algorithms 
(Ngo et al., 2013; Staresina et al., 2015). To isolate SO-spindle complexes, we identified 
events where SO down-states were followed by sleep spindles within a time window of 
1.5 s (for a time–frequency representation of the SO-spindle complexes see Figure 2a; for 
a peri-event SO-spindle histogram, see Figure S 2). To determine whether learning-
related (i.e., category-specific) neuronal activity would be differentially reactivated 

 
124 
during SO-spindle complexes, we first trained a classifier on the concatenated localizer 
data from both experimental sessions [−0.5 to 3 s]. Importantly, the localizer tasks of both 
sessions included object and scene images, to ensure that multivariate measures of 
potential reactivation not merely reflect session-specific EEG properties. The resulting 
training weights were then applied on both sessions’ sleep data, centred around the 
downstate of SO-spindle complexes (for related results where the data were locked to 
different spindle features see Figure S 3). Classifier testing labels reflected the stimulus 
category used in the preceding encoding session (object or scene), such that above-chance 
classification signifies endogenous activation patterns more strongly resembling the just-
learned stimulus category than the alternative stimulus category.

of all SO-spindle segments (z-scored across time; only positive values are displayed, with

represents t values against surrogate decoding performance, which was estimated by 
shuffling the training labels 250 times). The averaged EEG trace (all instances in which 
SO down-states were followed by sleep spindles within 1.5 s at channel Cz in microvolt 
[μV]) illustrates the relationship of the observed reactivation signal with ongoing 
oscillatory activity. The topographical insert illustrates the results of a “searchlight 
decoding procedure”, indicating that bilateral parietal and occipital areas exhibited 
stimulus-category related effects (please note that statistical tests were done for 
illustrative purposes only). (c) Phases of the SO-spindle modulation derived from channel 
Cz, illustrating the clustering of spindle power toward the SO upstate (upstate 
corresponding to 0 and downstate to ± π, with –π/2 reflecting the down- to upstate 
transition; Rayleigh test: p < 0.0001; z = 16.71). The black line illustrates the mean 
coupling direction and vector length (−36.78° ± 5.48°, mean vector length = 0.91). 
Circular-linear correlation analysis between the individual mean SO-spindle coupling 
phase (circles) and the mean reactivation strength (area under the curve [AUC] scores; 
colour coded, with white indicating high classification performance and black low 
classification 
performance) 
revealed 
a 
positive 
association 
(r = 0.66; p = 0.011). (d) Reactivation strength correlated positively with behavioural 
levels 
of 
associative 
memory 
consolidation 
(Spearman’s 
Rank 
Correlation, r = 0.45, p = 0.048).  
As shown in Figure 2b, results revealed a cluster of significant above-chance 
classification from 800 to 1200 ms relative to the SO downstate (p = 0.016, corrected for 
multiple comparisons across time, localizer time-window [1000 to 1800 ms]), emerging 
between maximum and offset of coupled sleep spindles (for the corresponding accuracy 
map see Figure S 4; for participant specific classification values see Table S 3). No 
negative cluster survived correction for multiple comparisons (cluster with 
smallest p > 0.6). 
But does endogenous memory reactivation indeed require the joint presence of SOs and 
spindles? To address this question, we performed the same decoding procedure, but 
locking the data to solitary SO or spindle events (thus, SOs without spindles and vice 
versa). For both types of events, when testing accuracy levels against chance at any 

 
126 
localizer time × sleep time point, no significant cluster of above-chance classification 
emerged (in both cases cluster with the smallest p > 0.2, see Figure S 5; similarly, testing 
the classifier on Slow spindle—SO-locked data did not yield any significant cluster of 
above-chance classification (cluster with smallest p = 0.67; see Figure S 6)). 
2.3. 
Precision of SO-spindle coupling correlates with reactivation strength 
If SO-spindle coupling is indeed instrumental for consolidation, its precision should 
impact the extent of endogenous memory reactivation. To quantify the preferred phase of 
SO-spindle modulation, we determined in every participant the SO phases corresponding 
to the spindle peak amplitudes (electrode Cz). In 16/20 participants we found significant 
nonuniform distributions (p < 0.05; Rayleigh test, mean vector length: 0.34 ± 0.03). In 
line with previous findings, we found a significant nonuniform distribution across 
participants (Rayleigh z = 16.71, p < 0.0001), with spindles peaking near the SO upstate 
(corresponding to 0°; mean coupling direction: −36.78° ± 5.48°; see Figure 2c). 
To further test whether the precision of SO-spindle coupling would be relevant for the 
reactivation of memories we computed a circular-linear correlation between each 
participant’s preferred SO-spindle phase (averaged across sessions) and their mean 
reactivation strength (averaged across the significant cluster shown in Figure 2b). The 
individual SO-spindle modulation phase was significantly correlated with decoding 
accuracy (r = 0.66; p = 0.011). The distribution indicated that the closer the spindles were 
nested towards the SO upstate, the higher the fidelity of the associated reactivation signal 
(see Figure 2c, for a scatter plot see Figure S 7; for additional analyses estimating the 
impact of trait-like characteristics in this context, see Supplementary Notes). 

 
127 
To ensure that the results described above were not driven by differential wake 
classification characteristics, we conducted a partial circular-linear correlation with the 
mean decoding levels from the localizer tasks (averaged across the significant cluster 
shown in Figure 1c) as a covariate. Again, we observed a positive relationship between 
the individual SO-spindle modulation phase and decoding accuracy (r = 0.65; p = 0.012). 
2.4. 
Reactivation strength predicts consolidation of associative memories 
If SO-spindle triggered reactivation reflects memory-related processes, one would expect 
a functional link with behavioural expressions of consolidation. To address this question, 
we correlated, across participants, levels of post-sleep memory retention and reactivation 
strength. Specifically, a “retention index” (proportion of post-sleep recalled images (out 
of hits) in relation to pre–sleep memory performance; see Methods section for details) 
was collapsed across sessions and correlated with decoding accuracies averaged across 
the significant cluster reported above. As shown in Figure 2d, we observed a significant 
positive relationship between the two variables (Spearman rho = 0.45, p = 0.048). Of 
note, no association between decoding accuracy and recognition memory performance 
was detectable (r = 0.02, p = 0.93), indicating that reactivation strength was specifically 
linked to the consolidation of hippocampal-dependent associative memories (Davachi, 
2006). However, the correlation between reactivation and consolidation of associative 
memory was not significantly greater than that with recognition memory 
(z = 1.35; p = 0.17). Lastly, we again controlled this analysis for localizer decoding levels 
using 
a 
partial 
correlation, 
which 
substantiated 
the 
results 
(Spearman 
rho = 0.45, p = 0.049). 

 
128 
3. Discussion 
Our results demonstrate that consolidation relies on endogenous memory reactivation 
clocked by SO-spindle complexes. In particular, we found that during the presence of 
SO-spindle complexes, activation patterns were biased towards the previously encoded 
learning material (Figure 2a, b). Moreover, the precision of SO-spindle coupling 
predicted the fidelity of memory reactivation (Figure 2c). Finally, reactivation strength 
predicted the amount of consolidation across participants, highlighting its functional 
significance for behavior (Figure 2d). 
NREM sleep oscillations (SOs, spindles, and ripples) have long been implicated in the 
memory function of sleep, and recent work has emphasized the importance of their 
temporal synchronization (Klinzing et al., 2019). Specifically, the precise timing of SOs, 
spindles, and ripples is thought to enable the relay of hippocampus-dependent memories 
to cortical networks (Rasch & Born, 2013). Indeed, recent work in rodents has shown that 
their co-occurrence is necessary for effective consolidation as assessed via fear 
conditioning (Latchoumane et al., 2017) or an object-in-place recognition task (Maingret 
et al., 2016). However, how these tasks relate to expressions of episodic memory in 
humans is not entirely clear. Human iEEG work with epilepsy patients has corroborated 
the triple-interaction of these sleep oscillations (Helfrich et al., 2019; X. X. Jiang et al., 
2019; Staresina et al., 2015), but none of these studies has assessed memory reactivation 
or the effects on behaviour. Investigation of healthy participants via scalp EEG has shown 
that brain patterns across sleep differ as a function of prior learning tasks (Schönauer et 
al., 2017), but these activation patterns were not directly related to wake activity or to 
discrete SOs/spindles. Another study employed simultaneous EEG-fMRI and found 

 
129 
univariate signal increases in learning-related areas during spindles (Bergmann et al., 
2012), but it remained open whether such reactivation bears relevance for memory 
consolidation. Finally, the advent of TMR protocols (Rasch et al., 2007; Rudoy et al., 
2009) has shown evidence for both SO-spindle complexes and information processing in 
response to external reminders (Bar et al., 2020; Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018; Göldi et 
al., 2019; Oyarzún et al., 2017; Schechtman et al., 2021; Schreiner et al., 2018; Wang et 
al., 2019), but it is unclear whether and how such exogenous memory reactivation relates 
to endogenous reactivation in service of memory consolidation. In sum, different lines of 
research across species point to a key role in coupled sleep oscillations, but the dynamics 
of endogenous reactivation in humans and its relevance for memory consolidation has 
remained unclear. 
In the current study, we tackled this question by employing two learning sessions per 
participant, each using different and analytically discriminable learning stimuli (object 
and scene images, Figure 1a). To ensure that multivariate measures of reactivation not 
merely reflect session-specific EEG properties, we included an object/scene localizer task 
in each session and trained a linear classifier on the combined data. This allowed us to 
track the re-emergence of learning categories during the nap periods. It deserves mention 
that decoding levels were modest in general and not every participant reached above-
chance classification (18/20, see Figure 2d and Table S 3). Several reasons might limit 
the effect size when decoding memory reprocessing during sleep. First, the signal of 
interest (i.e., sleep electrophysiology) is inherently noisy. Guided by theoretical 
considerations we limited the search-space for memory reactivation to the presence of 
SO-spindle complexes. Still, it is unlikely that each single SO-spindle complex is 
associated with memory reactivation. Including the presence of ripples as a criterion may 

 
130 
increase sensitivity, but even SO-spindle-ripple complexes are unlikely to yield robust 
memory reactivation in every instance (Swanson et al., 2020). Second, our data show that 
SO down-states represent viable reference points for time-locking the analysis of memory 
reactivation. However, there is considerable variability in signal characteristics across 
SOs and spindles (e.g., event durations or peak times), and such across-event variability 
diminishes classification power which relies on spatiotemporal activation patterns 
common across events. That said, decoding levels observed here are in line with previous 
TMR studies examining sleep-related memory reactivation with multivariate 
classification (Belal et al., 2018; Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). 
Importantly, we found that higher decoding performance correlates with the behavioural 
expression of memory consolidation across participants, further corroborating the 
functional significance of reactivation. 
Another key feature of our paradigm was the assessment of both item- and associative 
memory performance. Interestingly, the strength of memory reactivation during sleep 
predicted consolidation levels for associative memory only. This finding could indicate 
that reactivation particularly benefits hippocampus-dependent memories (Davachi, 
2006). However, it might also reflect the fact that reactivation pertained to the categorical 
features of the learning material, which was also the aspect relevant for associative- and 
not item memory. Moreover, while performance levels were carefully matched between 
object and scene tasks (Figure 1b), performance was lower for associative memory than 
for item recognition. Thus, differential effects of reactivation for associative- vs. item 
memory could also suggest differential benefits of sleep for weaker vs. stronger memories 
(Cairney et al., 2016; Creery et al., 2015; Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007; Schapiro et 
al., 2017; but see Petzka et al., 2021).   

 
131 
Owing to the limited spatial resolution of scalp EEG (especially for transient high-
frequency oscillations), our current data remain agnostic with regard to hippocampal 
ripples. That said, a recent iEEG study has shown that both hippocampal ripples and 
hippocampal–cortical interactions are most eminent when preceded by a cortical SO-
spindle complex (Helfrich et al., 2019). To the extent that reactivation observed here is 
linked to hippocampal engagement, the timing of our effects (Figure 2a, b) is consistent 
with accumulating evidence that the hippocampal–cortical dialog is in fact initiated by 
cortex (Helfrich et al., 2019; Navarrete et al., 2020; Ngo et al., 2020; Rothschild, 2019; 
Rothschild et al., 2017). One tentative interpretation of our results might thus be that 
cortical SO-spindle complexes trigger hippocampal memory reactivation while ensuring 
that the cortical target area is optimally tuned for synaptic plasticity and memory 
reprocessing (Niethard et al., 2018; Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005; Sejnowski & Destexhe, 
2000). Indeed, recent rodent work has shown that optogenetic induction of SO-locked 
spindles enhances SOs-spindle-ripple coupling and the consolidation of hippocampus-
dependent memories (Latchoumane et al., 2017). Our finding that reactivation peaks 
towards the end of spindles (Figure 2b) is consistent with the idea that mnemonic 
reprocessing and integration into neocortical networks continue after sleep spindles, i.e., 
during periods of spindle “refractoriness” (Antony et al., 2018). Likewise, intracranial 
recordings in humans have shown that hippocampal–cortical connectivity (“mutual 
information”) mediated by hippocampal ripples occurred ~500–1500 ms after the SO 
downstate (Helfrich et al., 2019), again matching the time window in which we observed 
memory reactivation. Together, one tentative scenario might be that memory processing 
is most beneficial after SO-spindle complexes, i.e., at time points of elevated cortical 
plasticity. 

 
132 
Analytically, our approach relied on (i) matching behavioural performance between 
sessions, (ii) pooling sleep data across both sessions, and (iii) deriving evidence for the 
reactivation of learning material across all aggregated SO-spindle complexes. These 
design features leave some interesting questions open for future work. First, to what 
extent might trait-like participant characteristics drive both reactivation and memory 
processes? Using our sleep questionnaires, we were able to rule out subjective sleep 
quality and circadian rhythm as confounds (see Supplementary Notes), but there may be 
other trait-like factors impacting reactivation and consolidation. An alternative design 
would be to conduct a longitudinal study in which within-participant levels of learning 
and consolidation are experimentally manipulated across multiple sessions (e.g., by 
varying encoding depth or task difficulty). Second, while aggregating all SO-spindle 
events is essential for the classification approach, it leaves open whether reactivation 
occurs during each SO-spindle event. An alternative approach might be to use intracranial 
recordings to identify single neurons that are tuned to stimuli used in a specific learning 
session and then track engagement of these neurons during individual SO-spindle 
complexes. Such more fine-grained methods might provide additional insights into 
reactivation-related characteristics (e.g., accuracy and frequency of reactivation 
processes). In conclusion, our results indicate that endogenous memory reactivation in 
service of sleep-dependent consolidation is clocked by the fine-tuned coupling of SOs 
and spindles. Future work employing simultaneous recordings from the hippocampus will 
further elucidate the intricate dynamics underlying the hippocampal–cortical dialog of 
systems consolidation.

4. Methods 
4.1. 
Participants 
Twenty healthy, right-handed participants (mean age: 20.75 ± 0.35; 17 female) with 
normal or corrected-to-normal vision took part in the experiment. An additional five 
participants had to be excluded due to insufficient sleep (less than 30 min sleep during 
one of the sessions). The sample size was determined in accordance with previous human 
sleep and memory studies (e.g., Helfrich et al., 2018; Ngo et al., 2015). Pre-study 
screening questionnaires (including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI, Buysse, 
Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989), the morningness–eveningness questionnaire 
(Horne & Ostberg, 1976), and a self-developed questionnaire querying general health 
status and the use of stimulants) indicated that participants did not take any medication at 
the time of the experimental session and did not suffer from any neurological or 
psychiatric disorders. All participants reported good overall sleep quality. Furthermore, 
they had not been on a night shift for at least 8 weeks before the experiment. All 
participants were instructed to wake up by 7 a.m. and avoid alcohol the evening before 
and caffeine on the day of the experimental sessions. They confirmed at the beginning of 
each experimental session their adherence to the requirements. The study was approved 
by the University of Birmingham Research Ethics Committee and written informed 
consent was obtained from participants.

4.2. 
Stimuli and procedures 
Overview 
The experiment consisted of two experimental sessions (object and scene condition), 
separated by at least 1 week (mean = 8.5 ± 0.85 days). The order of the two sessions was 
counterbalanced across participants. On experimental days participants arrived at the 
sleep laboratory at 11 a.m. The experimental session started with the set-up for 
polysomnographic recordings during which electrodes for electroencephalographic 
(EEG), electromyographic (EMG), and electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings were 
applied. Before the experimental sessions, participants were habituated to the 
environment by spending an adaptation nap in the sleep laboratory. 
At around 12 a.m. the experiment started with a modified version of the psychomotor 
vigilance task (“PVT”, Dinges & Powell, 1985), followed by the memory task (for details 
see Memory Task below). The sleep period began at ~1 p.m. and participants were given 
120 min to nap (mean total sleep time: 101.63 ± 2.23 min; for sleep characteristics see 
Table S 2). Afterwards, the vigilance of all participants was assessed using the PVT and 
memory performance was tested again. At the end of each session a localizer task was 
conducted (see Localizer Task for details). 
Stimuli 
A set of in total 360 verbs and 240 images (half objects and half scenes) served as 
experimental stimuli during both sessions. Objects were images of animals, food, 
clothing, tools, or household items presented on a plain white background (e.g., a 
hammer). Scenes were images of nameable landscapes or places (e.g., a coffee shop). All 
images were taken from (Konkle et al., 2010).   

 
135 
Experimental tasks 
For the recording of behavioural responses and the presentation of all experimental tasks, 
Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (Brainard, 1997) and MATLAB 2018b (MathWorks, 
Natick, USA) were used. Participants completed a practice run (five trials) of each 
experimental task in advance to ensure they fully understood the instructions. Responses 
were made via keyboard presses on a dedicated PC. Across all experimental phases, 
presentation order of stimuli was randomized across participants. 
Psychomotor vigilance task 
The vigilance of the participants was assessed using a modified version of the “PVT” 
(Dinges & Powell, 1985) before the encoding phase and right after the sleep period. 
Participants were presented with a centred fixation cross on the computer screen. Every 
2–10 s the fixation cross was replaced by a counter counting up from 0 to 2 s in steps of 
20 ms. Participants were instructed to stop the counter as fast as possible by pressing the 
space bar. After each trial participants were provided with feedback about their reaction 
time. The task was administered for 5 min. For PVT related results see Figure S 8. 
Familiarization 
The experiment began with an image familiarization phase. The purpose of this part was 
(i) to facilitate learning of the verb-image pairs in the main encoding session and (ii) to 
provide the proper image names for subsequent cued recall. Each trial started with a 
fixation cross, presented for 1.5 ± 0.1 s. Subsequently, participants saw one of 130 images 
showing objects or scenes (depending on the experimental session). About 120 of these 
images were part of the subsequent learning material and were accompanied by a caption 
naming the exemplar. Ten additional images, which were not further used during the 

 
136 
experiment, were accompanied by an erroneous description. Each stimulus combination 
was presented for 2.5 s on the computer screen. The participants’ task was to press a 
button whenever they encountered a wrong image-word combination. 
Encoding 
Participants learned pairwise associations between 120 verbs and images. The images 
comprised either objects or scenes (depending on experimental session). 
Each trial started with a fixation cross, presented for 1.5 ± 0.1 s. Afterwards, a verb (e.g., 
“jump”) was presented for 1 s on the computer screen and immediately followed by the 
to-be-associated image for 4 s. Participants were instructed to form a vivid mental image 
or story linking the verb and the object/scene. After the presentation of the image (4 s), 
they had to indicate whether the image they had formed was realistic or bizarre. In 
addition, participants were informed that their memory performance for verb- image pairs 
would be tested later. The learning block was run twice with varying trial order to reach 
satisfactory levels of pre-sleep memory performance (as determined in a pilot study). 
Pre-sleep memory test 
In order to prevent any testing effect on our behavioural measures of memory 
consolidation (Antony et al., 2017; Roediger & Karpicke, 2006), only half of the learned 
verb-image combinations was tested during the pre-sleep memory test. Thus, the pre-
sleep memory test included 60 randomly chosen verbs intermixed with 30 new verbs, 
which were not seen by the participants before (“foils”). Each trial started with a fixation 
cross, presented for 1.5 ± 0.1 s. After the fixation cross, a verb was presented on the 
computer screen. After 3 s, participants had to indicate whether the verb was “old” (i.e., 
part of the learning material) or “new”’ (i.e., it was not seen during learning) within the 

 
137 
next 10 s. In case of “new” responses, participants immediately moved on to the next trial. 
In case of “old” responses, participants were required to type a description of the image 
they had in mind or to type “do not know” in case they could not recall the target image. 
Trials were coded as correct if (i) the participant typed the same caption as shown during 
the familiarization phase or (ii) the description unambiguously matched the content of the 
image 
Sleep period 
The nap period began at ~1 p.m. Participants had the opportunity to sleep in a laboratory 
bedroom for 120 min, while their brain activity was monitored using polysomnography). 
Post-sleep memory test 
Twenty minutes after waking up, participants performed another memory test on the 
remaining 60 study items. This followed the same procedures as the pre-sleep memory 
test with the exception that new foil verbs were used. 
Localizer task 
During the localizer task participants were presented with a new set of images comprising 
objects and scenes (90 objects and 90 scenes, irrespective of session). Each trial started 
with a fixation cross, presented for 1.5 ± 0.1 s. Subsequently, a randomly chosen image 
(object or scene) was presented on the computer screen for a minimum of 2.5 and a 
maximum of 10 s. Each image was presented twice during the task and participants were 
instructed to indicate whether it was shown for the first (“new”) or second (“old”) time 
(mean distance between successive presentations = 8.06, range = 2–33). 
By administering the localizer task at the very end of each session, we assured that 
participants engaged exclusively with a given stimulus category before sleep (objects or 

 
138 
scenes, respectively). The rationale of this approach was to keep the category-specific 
representations during learning as pure as possible, in an effort to bias their reactivation 
during the subsequent sleep period. However, presenting both stimulus categories during 
the localizer task ensured that category-specific classifier evidence during sleep would 
not merely reflect general differences between sessions (e.g., electrode impedances, 
electrode positions, etc.). 
4.3. 
EEG 
A Brain Products 64 channel EEG system was used to record electroencephalography 
(EEG) throughout the experiment. Impedances were kept below 10 kΩ. EEG signals were 
referenced online to electrode FCz and sampled at a rate of 1000 Hz. Furthermore, EMG 
and the ECG was recorded for polysomnography. Sleep architecture was determined 
offline according to standard criteria by two independent raters (Iber et al., 2007).   
4.4. 
Data analysis 
Behavioural preprocessing 
To assess recognition memory performance, we calculated the sensitivity index d′ [i.e., 
z(Hits)—z(False Alarms)] according to signal detection theory. Proportions of 0 and 1 
were replaced by 1/2 N and 1–1/2 N, respectively, with N representing the number of 
trials in each proportion (i.e., N = 60, see ref. Macmillan & Creelman, 2005). 
For associative memory performance we calculated the proportion of correctly recalled 
images relative to the number of recognized words (i.e., (recalled images/hits) ∗∗ 100). 
To correlate levels of memory retention and reactivation strength we derived a “retention 
index”. We computed the proportion of post-sleep recalled images (out of hits) in relation 

 
139 
to pre-sleep memory performance (i.e., (recalled out of hits post-sleep/recalled out of hits 
pre-sleep) ∗ 100) and collapsed these measures across sessions. 
EEG data analysis 
EEG data were preprocessed using the FieldTrip toolbox for EEG/MEG analysis 
(Oostenveld et al., 2011). All data were downsampled to 200 Hz. Subsequently, the 
localizer and sleep data were segmented into epochs. The temporal range of the epochs 
was [–1 to 3] s around stimulus onset for localizer trials. As in other studies concentrating 
on the coordination of SOs and spindles (Demanuele et al., 2017; Hahn et al., 2020; 
Helfrich et al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019; Staresina et al., 2015) we specifically 
focused on electrode Cz due to the spatial distribution of both oscillations. Both 
oscillations show strong presence over central areas, rendering Cz an optimal target zone 
for investigating concomitant activity of SOs and (fast) spindles. Hence, for the sleep 
data, slow oscillation—spindle epochs [−2.5 to +2.5 s] time-locked to SO down-states 
were extracted from channel Cz (for details see Event detection). 
Noisy EEG channels were identified by visual inspection, discarded, and interpolated, 
using a weighted average of the neighbouring channels. The localizer data were 
additionally subjected to an independent component analysis (Jung et al., 1998) and ICA 
components associated with eye blinks and eye movements were identified and rejected. 
Event detection and SO-spindle coupling 
SOs and sleep spindles were identified for each participant, based on established detection 
algorithms (Ngo et al., 2013; Staresina et al., 2015). Following standard procedures, all 
sleep data were re-referenced against linked mastoids for sleep scoring and event 
detection (Cox & Fell, 2020; Iber et al., 2007; Silber et al., 2007); please note that the 

 
140 
classification results reported in Figure 2b remained unchanged when using a CAR 
scheme. SOs were detected as follows: Data were filtered between 0.3–1.25 Hz (two-pass 
FIR bandpass filter, order = three cycles of the low frequency cut-off). Only movement-
free data (as determined during sleep scoring) from NREM sleep stages 2 and 3 were 
taken into account. All zero-crossings were determined in the filtered signal at channel 
Cz, and event duration was determined for SO candidates (that is, down-states followed 
by up-states) as time between two successive positive- to-negative zero-crossings. Events 
that met the SO duration criteria (minimum of 0.8 and maximum of 2 s, 0.5–1.25 Hz) 
entered the analysis. 5-s-long segments (±2.5 s centred on the downstate) were extracted 
from the unfiltered raw signal. 
For spindle detection, data were filtered between 12–18 Hz (De Gennaro & Ferrara, 2003; 
Ngo et al., 2020; two-pass FIR bandpass filter, order = three cycles of the low frequency 
cut-off), and again only artifact-free data from NREM sleep stages 2 and 3 were used for 
event detection. The root mean square (RMS) signal was calculated for the filtered signal 
at channel Cz using a moving average of 200 ms, and a spindle amplitude criterion was 
defined as the 75% percentile of RMS values. Whenever the signal exceeded this 
threshold for more than 0.5 s but less than 3 s (duration criteria), a spindle event was 
detected. Epochs time-locked to the minimum spindle trough (−2.5 to +2.5 s) were 
extracted from the unfiltered raw signal for all events. To isolate SO-spindle complexes, 
we determined for all SOs whether a spindle was detected following the SO (SO 
downstate + 1.5 s). Finally, SO-spindle events were extracted (−2.5 to +2.5 s with regards 
to the SO downstate) from the raw signal at channel Cz. 

 
141 
For the analysis of SO-spindle coupling (Helfrich et al., 2019; Staresina et al., 2015), we 
filtered the SO-spindle data in the SO range (0.3–1.25 Hz, two-pass Butterworth bandpass 
filter), applied a Hilbert transform and extracted the instantaneous phase angle. Next, we 
filtered the same data segments in the spindle range (12–18 Hz two-pass Butterworth 
bandpass filter), Hilbert transformed the signal and extracted the instantaneous amplitude. 
Only data points within ±1.5 s were considered to avoid filter-related edge artifacts. Then 
we detected the maximal sleep spindle amplitude in channel Cz and isolated the 
corresponding SO phase angle. The preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling was then 
obtained from averaging all individual events’ preferred phases of each participant, and 
the resulting distribution across participants was tested against uniformity (Rayleigh test, 
CircStat toolbox; Berens, 2009). 
Multivariate analysis 
Multivariate classification of single-trial EEG data was performed using MVPA-Light, a 
MATLAB-based toolbox for multivariate pattern analysis (Treder, 2020). For all 
multivariate analyses, a LDA was used as a classifier (Treder, 2020). Prior to 
classification, all data were re-referenced using a common average reference (CAR). 
For classification within the localizer task, the localizer data were z-scored across all trials 
for each time point separately. Next, data from both sessions were collapsed and subjected 
to a principal component analysis (PCA), which transforms the data into linearly 
uncorrelated components, ordered by the amount of variance explained by each 
component (Jackson, 1991). PCA was applied to reduce dimensionality and limit over-
fitting (Jiang & Guo, 2007) and the first 30 principal components were retained for further 
analysis (Grootswagers et al., 2017; Pinheiro-Chagas et al., 2019; Sankaran et al., 2018). 

 
142 
To quantify whether object and scene representations can be differentiated in the 
localizer, the classifier was trained and tested to discriminate between object and scene 
trials. Data were smoothed using a running average window of 150 ms. The EEG channels 
served as features and a different classifier was trained and tested on every time point. As 
metric, we used Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), which indexes the mean accuracy 
with which a randomly chosen pair of Class A and Class B trials could be assigned to 
their correct classes (0.5 = random performance; 1.0 = perfect performance). To avoid 
overfitting, data were split into training and test sets using fivefold cross-validation 
(Lemm et al., 2011). Since cross-validation results are stochastic due to the random 
assignment of trials into folds, the analysis was repeated five times and results were 
averaged. For statistical evaluation, surrogate decoding performance was calculated by 
shuffling the training labels 250 times. Resulting surrogate performance values were then 
averaged, providing baseline values for each participant under the null hypothesis of label 
exchangeability. 
To investigate differential evidence for object vs. scene representations as a function of 
prior learning during SO-spindle complexes (Figure 2b), we used the temporal 
generalization method (King & Dehaene, 2014). Prior to decoding, a baseline correction 
was applied based on the whole trial ([−0.5 to 3 s] for localizer segments; [–1.5 to 1.5 s] 
for SO-spindle segments). Next, localizer and sleep data were z-scored across trials and 
collapsed across sessions. PCA was applied to the pooled wake-sleep data and the first 
30 principal components were retained. Localizer and sleep data were smoothed using a 
running average window of 150 ms. A classifier was then trained for every time point in 
the localizer data (Figure 2b, vertical axis) and applied on every time point during SO-
spindle complexes (horizontal axis). No cross-validation was required since localizer and 

 
143 
sleep datasets were independent. As metric, we again used AUC (see above). For 
statistical evaluation, surrogate decoding performance was calculated by shuffling the 
training labels (stemming from the localizer task) 250 times. Again, the resulting 
performance values were averaged, providing baseline values for each participant under 
the null hypothesis of label exchangeability.  
To resolve the topography of diagnostic features, we conducted a “searchlight decoding 
procedure”. In brief, PCA components were projected back to sensor space and the 
classification procedure was repeated across moving kernels of small electrode clusters, 
with neighbouring electrodes being selected as features [feature number range: 5 to 9]. 
Classifiers were trained for every time point in the localizer data and applied on every 
time point during SO-spindle complexes. Finally, classification values were collapsed 
across our time windows of interest [localizer time: 1000 to 2000 ms; SO-spindle time: 
800 to 1200 ms] and tested against chance level (corrected for multiple comparisons 
across space). A broad cluster of above-chance classification comprising bilateral parietal 
and occipital areas emerged (pcluster = 0.004). 
Time–frequency analysis 
Time–frequency analysis of the SO-spindle segments was performed using FieldTrip. 
Frequency decomposition of the data, using Fourier analysis based on sliding time 
windows (moving forward in 50 ms increments). The window length was set to five 
cycles of a given frequency (frequency range: 1–30 Hz in 1 Hz steps). The windowed data 
segments were multiplied with a Hanning taper before Fourier analysis. Afterwards, 
power values were z-scored across time [−4 to 4 s]. The longer time segments were 

 
144 
chosen to allow for resolving low frequency activity within the time windows of interest 
[−1.5 to 1.5 s] and avoid edge artifacts. 
4.5. 
Statistics 
Behavioural retrieval data were subjected to a 2 (Category: Object/Scene) × 2 (Test-Time: 
Pre-sleep/Post-sleep) repeated measures ANOVA. To test for potential differences in 
memory accuracy between sessions in the localizer task, a paired sampled t-test was 
computed. The statistical significance thresholds for all behavioural analyses were set 
at p < .05. Spearman correlation was used to assess the relationship between memory 
retention and reactivation strength. To control for mean decoding levels from the localizer 
tasks (averaged across the significant cluster), a partial Spearman correlation was used. 
SPSS (IBM Corp., Version 26) and Matlab was used for behavioural data analyses. 
FieldTrip’s cluster permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007) was used to deal with 
the multiple comparisons problem for all classification analyses. A dependent-samples t-
test was used at the sample level to identify clusters of contiguous time points across 
participants and values were thresholded at p = 0.05. Maxsum (sum of all t values in 
cluster) served as cluster statistic and Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the 
cluster p value (alpha = 0.05, two-tailed) under the permutation distribution. Analyses 
were performed at the group level. The input data were either classification values across 
time (Figure 1c) or time x time classification values (Figure 2b). In all cases a two-sided 
cluster permutation test with 1000 randomizations was used to contrast classification 
accuracy against chance performance. 

 
145 
Non-uniformity of the preferred phase with regard to SO-spindle coupling was assessed 
using the Rayleigh test (CircStat toolbox). The nonlinear relationship between SO-spindle 
coupling and reactivation strength was determined with a circular-linear correlation as 
implemented in the CircStat toolbox. A partial circular-linear correlation modified from 
the CircStat toolbox was used to control for the mean decoding levels from the localizer 
task. In all cases the statistical significance thresholds were set at p < 0.05.

Figure S 5.1. Stability of EEG object vs. scene decoding during the localizer tasks. (a + 
b) To estimate the across-session stability of our decoding approach, we trained a 
classifier on the localizer data of object sessions and tested it on the localizer data of the 
scene sessions. (a) We found robust above- chance classification when training the 
classifier on the localizer of the object session and applying the training weights to the 
corresponding data from the scene session (two-sided dependent-samples t-test; p = 
0.002, cluster corrected across time). (b) The same result pattern emerged when training 
on the scene session data and applying the training weights to the object session data 
(two-sided dependent-samples t-test; p = 0.002, cluster corrected across time). (c + d) 
During the localizer task, each image was presented twice. To estimate the across-
presentation stability of our decoding approach, we trained a classifier on the first image 
presentation tested it on the second presentation. (c) We observed a significant cluster of 
above-chance classification when training the classifier on the first presentation and 
applying it to the second presentation (two-sided dependent-samples t-test; p = 0.0018, 
cluster corrected across time). (d) A highly comparable result pattern emerged when 
training on the second presentation and applying it to the first presentation (two-sided 
dependent-samples t-test; p = 0.002; p =0.019, cluster corrected across time).

Figure S 5.2. Perievent histogram of sleep spindles (amplitude maxima) following SO 
down- states (time = zero; normalized by number of spindles). Note that due to our 
definition of SO-spindle complexes (with sleep spindles following SOs), no spindles 
appear prior to  SO  down-states  (time-point  zero).  
 
 
Figure S 5.3. Classification locked to different spindle features. To test for the impact of 
different features of SO-spindle complexes on the synchronisation of reactivation events, 
the classification was computed on SO-spindle data locked to the onset, maximum and 
offset of spindles. Informed by the   main analysis, the utilized time-window of both the 
localizer task and SO-spindle complexes were adjusted accordingly [localizer time: 1000-
2000ms; SO-spindle time: -500 to 1500ms relative to respective feature (spindle onset, 
maximum amplitude and offset)]. Testing accuracy levels against chance at any localizer   
time x sleep time point for data locked to spindle on-and offsets (a + c) did not lead to 
any significant above chance classification (two-sided dependent-samples t-test; cluster 
with the smallest p-value for spindle onset: p = 0.25; spindle offset: p = 0.051, cluster 
corrected across time). However, testing the classifier on SO-spindle data locked to the 
spindle maximum (b) peaks yielded a positive cluster of significant above chance 
classification (two-sided dependent-samples t-test; p = 0.019, SO-spindle time [250 to 
500ms], localizer time-window [1400 to 1800ms], cluster corrected across time).

Figure S 5.5. Memory reactivation during solitary SO and spindle events. (a + b). To test 
whether endogenous memory reactivation indeed requires the joint presence of SOs and 
spindles, we performed the decoding procedure on solitary SO or spindle events (thus, 
SOs without spindles and vice versa). Time-windows of both the localizer task and SO-
spindle complexes were restricted according to the main results [localizer time: 1000-
2000ms; SO-spindle time: -500 to 1500ms relative to respective event (SO down-state, 
spindle maximum)]. For both types of events, when testing accuracy levels against chance 
at any localizer time x sleep time point, no significant cluster of above chance 
classification emerged (two- sided dependent-samples t-test: in both cases cluster with 
the smallest p > 0.2; cluster corrected across time). The black contour lines in (a) illustrate 
the extent of the significant cluster derived from the main analysis (classification during 
the presence of SO-spindle complexes). (c) Summed t-values of the significant

the average response time during the post-sleep PVT was 355.2 ± 3.6 ms. Reaction times 
did not differ between testing times (pre-encoding vs. post-sleep; t = -1.29, p = 0.20).

Supplemental Notes  
Assessing the impact of trait-like characteristics on the interplay of memory reactivation 
with the preferred SO-spindle phase and the behavioural expressions of consolidation. 
Our results suggest that memory reactivation is linked to the preferred SO-spindle phase 
as well as to behavioural expressions of consolidation. However, SO-spindle coupling 
and consolidation might also be governed by other, trait-like participant characteristics. 
We thus examined - using hierarchical regressions - whether subjective sleep quality (as 

 
153 
determined the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) or circadian rhythm (derived from 
the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ)) would account for memory 
performance or the preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling above and beyond 
reactivation strength during sleep.  
In Step 1, reactivation strength explained 29.5% of the variance in memory performance 
(R2 = 0.295, F1,18= 7.51, P = 0.013). In Steps 2 and 3, neither subjective sleep quality 
(PSQI global score collapsed across the two sessions, range = 2-5 across participants), 
nor circadian rhythm (MEQ score collapsed across the two sessions, range = 31-66 across 
participants) explained significant amounts of additional variance (Step 2: ΔR2 = 0.001, 
ΔF2,16= 0.014, P = 0.91; Step 3: ΔR2 < 0.01, ΔF3,13< 0.01, P = 0.98). Similarly, using 
the preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling as the dependent variable, in Step 1 
reactivation strength explained 37.2% of the variance (R2 = 0.372, F1,18= 10.65, P = 
0.004). In Step 2 and 3, neither subjective sleep quality nor circadian rhythm explained 
significant amounts of additional variance (Step 2: ΔR2 = 0.07, ΔF2,16= 0.18, P = 0.67; 
Step 3: ΔR2 = 0.01, ΔF3,13= 0,30 P = 0.59). Please note that the distribution of the 
preferred phase values (all clustering between –π / 2 and 0 degrees) enabled us to add 
these circular data to the linear regression analysis. Nevertheless, to further test for 
potential associations between subjective sleep quality, circadian rhythm and the 
preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling, we administered additional circular- linear 
correlations. Neither sleep quality (rho = 0.04, p = 0.98) nor circadian rhythm (rho = 0.24, 
p = 0.47) correlated significantly with the preferred phase.  

 
154 
Together, although other trait-like characteristics not captured in the present analysis 
might have an influence, these results rule out that the link between memory reactivation 
and consolidation or the phase of SO-spindle coupling is driven by participants’ 
subjective sleep quality or circadian rhythm.

In this chapter, the main findings of all experimental chapters will be summarised, relate 
to each other and limitations will be highlighted. It will be discussed to which extent 
answers to the two questions raised in chapter 1 (i.e., Which and how are memories 
consolidated during sleep?) are advanced by the main findings of this thesis. Consistent 
and inconsistent findings within the thesis will then be addressed and embedded in the 
existing literature. Future research directions and ideas emerging from findings of this 
thesis and related findings in the field will be outlined.  
1. Main findings 
1.1. Which memories are consolidated during sleep? – Weaker as well as stronger 
memories are consolidated during sleep 
It is well established that sleep benefits declarative memory consolidation (Diekelmann 
& Born, 2010; Jenkins & Dallenbach, 1924; Müller & Pilzecker, 1900; Rasch & Born, 
2013). Yet, it is still unknown whether all declarative memories benefit equally from 
sleep or whether a selection process determines a preferred consolidation of some 
memories over others.  
Recent findings suggest a preferred consolidation of weakly over strongly encoded 
memories during post-encoding sleep (Cairney et al., 2016; Creery et al., 2015; Denis, 
Schapiro, Poskanzer, Bursal, Charon, et al., 2020; Denis, Mylonas, et al., 2021; 
Drosopoulos, Schulze, et al., 2007; Lo et al., 2014; Payne et al., 2012; Schapiro et al., 
2017, 2018). However, performance for weakly and strongly encoded memories is often 
tested under the same retrieval conditions which, in some instances, result in ceiling 

 
157 
effects for stronger memories and hence, complicate the detection of sleep-dependent 
consolidation effects.  
In chapter 2, we tested the hypothesis that both weakly and strongly encoded memories 
may benefit from post-learning sleep, but that an adjustment of retrieval conditions is 
required. We hypothesised that, for strongly encoded memories, retrieval difficulty has 
to be increased to mitigate ceiling effects as ceiling effects may obscure potential sleep-
dependent consolidation effects. To this end, we developed a new memory paradigm 
(Memory Arena, Chapter 2, Figure 1 and Chapter 3, Figure 1) and manipulated in a 
between-subjects design (a) the retention interval which was either experienced asleep or 
awake, (b) memory strength that was either weak or strong (applying a training threshold 
of 1x50% for weakly encoded memories vs. 2x70% for strongly encoded memories) and 
(c) retrieval difficulty that was either normal or difficult (standard retrieval condition vs. 
inducing retroactive interference to increase retrieval difficulty). Under standard retrieval 
conditions (without retroactive interference), we replicated the finding that weakly 
compared to strongly encoded memories are preferentially consolidated during sleep. 
Intriguingly, and in line with our hypothesis, an increase in retrieval difficulty (by 
inducing retroactive interference) revealed sleep-dependent consolidation effects for 
weakly as well as for strongly encoded memories. It is worth noting that the results of 
chapter 3 further substantiate this conclusion. In both chapters, the Memory Arena 
paradigm was used to capture memory consolidation. This offered the possibility to apply 
the most suitable thresholds (for memory strength and retrieval difficulty) to measure 
sleep-dependent consolidation in chapter 3. Thus, in chapter 3, the same thresholds for 
memory strength and retrieval difficulty were applied as for the sleep group with high 
memory strength and high retrieval difficulty in chapter 2: Memories were strongly 

 
158 
encoded by applying a training threshold of 2x70% and following sleep, retrieval 
difficulty was increased by inducing retroactive interference. In chapter 3, we then 
showed that consolidation of memories can be predicted by an overlap between encoding 
and spindle topographies, even though the memories were strongly encoded. Therefore, 
in chapter 3, we demonstrate complementary results substantiating and furthering our 
conclusions from chapter 2 such that strongly encoded memories are consolidated during 
post-encoding sleep and that sleep spindles are a vehicle to provide their consolidation.  
Diverging from our conclusions, a recent study argues for sleep spindles specifically 
predicting memory consolidation of weakly encoded memories (Denis, Mylonas, et al., 
2021). While Denis et al. (2021) did not take encoding topographies into account, it is 
still worth considering that memory strength in this study, like in others (Creery et al., 
2015; Denis, Schapiro, Poskanzer, Bursal, Charron, et al., 2020; Schapiro et al., 2017), 
was manipulated within rather than across participants. Precisely, memory strength was 
manipulated within participants and across word pairs in such a way that for each 
participant, some word pairs were presented more frequently during encoding than others. 
Results revealed that weakly encoded word pairs are preferentially consolidated during 
sleep (Creery et al., 2015; Denis, Schapiro, Poskanzer, Bursal, Charron, et al., 2020; 
Denis, Mylonas, et al., 2021; Schapiro et al., 2017).  
However, while these studies did not vary retrieval demands in dependence of weakly 
and strongly encoded word pairs, we did not manipulate memory strength on the 
individual item level. One might speculate that, independently of our memory strength 
manipulation, some items were more strongly encoded than others. For example, within 
the stronger memory condition (training threshold of 2x70%) memory strength might still 
vary on the individual item level. Consequently, based on our findings, we cannot argue 

 
159 
for the absence of a selection process within each memory strength condition. If a 
selection process according to memory strength is assumed, however, our results imply 
that a possible selection is based, at least partly, on the memory strength of an item 
relative to the memory strength of other items rather than on an absolute memory strength 
threshold. This is because we found a sleep-dependent consolidation effect also in the 
strongly encoded condition.   
To further characterise such a selection process, a future study has to incorporate (a) a 
memory strength manipulation on an individual item level (relative memory strength as 
Denis et al., 2021,  did), (b) a memory strength manipulation of multiple items (between-
subjects factor to manipulate the absolute memory strength threshold as we did in chapter 
2) and (c) a variation of retrieval difficulty depending on an item’s memory strength (e.g., 
by manipulating the target-lure similarity in an item recognition task). This study can test 
three different predictions of how a selection process might look like: First, the selection 
process can be based on an absolute memory strength criterion that is independent of the 
number of items that are competing for consolidation (e.g., items with memory strength 
> xthres are not consolidated at all, independently of the memory strength of other 
competing items). Second, the selection process can be based on a relative memory 
strength criterion that is independent of the absolute memory strength (e.g., item1 is 
always consolidated if memory strength of item1 < memory strength of item2; xthres in this 
case does not matter). Third, the selection process can rely on both, on an absolute as well 
as relative memory strength criterion.  
Together, a follow-up study described here would address the existence as well as the 
characteristic of a potential selection process for sleep-dependent memory consolidation 
and provide important information about which memories are consolidated during sleep.  

 
160 
1.2. How are memories consolidated during sleep? Sleep spindles and slow 
oscillations orchestrate memory reactivation  
Sleep-dependent memory consolidation happens on a synaptic as well as on a systems 
level. While synaptic consolidation includes the remodelling of synapses and dendritic 
spines representing a memory trace, systems consolidation incorporates changes in 
memory representations across different brain areas (Dudai, 2004; Klinzing et al., 2019). 
The two mechanisms underlying consolidation which are discussed in this thesis 
(induction of plasticity and reactivation) might be attributed, at least partly, to the synaptic 
and systems level, respectively. The induction of plasticity as a mechanism subserving 
consolidation is often addressed by synaptic consolidation approaches, whereas memory 
reactivation is often defined as a mechanism by systems consolidation approaches.  
However, in chapter 3 we deviated from a strict categorisation into a synaptic and systems 
level by deriving a hypothesis from findings mainly addressing synaptic consolidation 
and testing this hypothesis on the systems level. Biophysical models and rodent research 
suggest that sleep spindles are a prime candidate to induce changes in synaptic plasticity 
in cortical neurons (Dickey et al., 2021; Niethard et al., 2018; Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005; 
Seibt et al., 2017; Sejnowski & Destexhe, 2000). Consequently, memory consolidation 
might rely on sleep spindles inducing synaptic plasticity specifically in cortical areas 
representing encoded memory traces. To test the hypothesis that memory consolidation 
can be explained by an overlap between encoding and spindle topographies, the memory 
paradigm of chapter 2 was applied in combination with EEG. We first demonstrated that 
the amplitude of sleep spindles correlated with encoding patterns and further, that the 
overlap between encoding and spindle amplitude pattern was associated with memory 
consolidation. Chapter 3 suggests that the induction of synaptic plasticity in encoding 

 
161 
related areas might be a mechanism of how sleep spindles subserve memory 
consolidation. While this is a tempting interpretation, it is worth noting that the evidence 
presented is chapter 3 is indirect (due to calcium activity as a proxy of synaptic plasticity 
not being measured), correlative and based on a small sample size (n = 19). Moreover, 
the Memory Arena Task, despite being a useful task for capturing temporal and spatial 
memory components, it has its downsides. That is, the lack of clearly bounded events 
makes it challenging to analyse the EEG signal due to missing event onsets and a pre-
event baseline. To counteract this limitation, in chapter 3 an external baseline was used 
that closely resembles a pre-event baseline in an event-related memory paradigm. 
Nevertheless, replicating the finding from chapter 3 with an event-related memory 
paradigm would provide important substantiation of the presented results.      
Future research is yet required to replicate the findings and also provide direct evidence 
(on the synaptic level) for our interpretation, e.g., by simultaneously measuring calcium 
and spindle activity during post-learning sleep in rodents and comparing calcium and 
spindle activity between cortical areas engaged and not engaged in pre-sleep learning.   
In chapter 4 and 5, evidence for another mechanism, i.e., memory reactivation, is 
provided. Theories state that memory consolidation is acquired by a simultaneous 
reactivation of memory representations in hippocampal and cortical areas (Rasch & Born, 
2007). Consequently, memory representations are redistributed from hippocampal to 
cortical areas and hence, transformed from labile into stable representations (Marr, 1971). 
The simultaneous reactivation across brain areas (i.e., hippocampus and neocortex) is 
thought to be synchronised by sleep oscillations, including slow oscillations, sleep 
spindles and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (Buzsáki, 1996; Diekelmann & Born, 2010; 
Paller et al., 2021; Walker & Stickgold, 2004). In humans, empirical evidence for 

 
162 
reactivation of information encoded during wakefulness is rare (but see Belal et al., 2018; 
Schönauer et al., 2017; Schreiner, Doeller, Jensen, Rasch, & Staudigl, 2018; Zhang, Fell, 
& Axmacher, 2018), leaving the interplay between memory reactivation and sleep 
oscillations mostly unaddressed. Exploiting new developed methods including MVPA 
(Grootswagers et al., 2017; Norman et al., 2006), we provide evidence for a temporal 
coupling of reactivation and sleep oscillations (slow oscillations and sleep spindles). In 
chapter 4, we investigated the timescale on which sequential memories are reactivated by 
applying MVPA and tested for a potential synchronisation by slow oscillations. To induce 
memory reactivation in this study, we applied a TMR protocol. In chapter 5, we used 
MVPA again to then investigate the interplay between endogenous memory reactivation 
and slow oscillation and sleep spindles. In chapter 4 and 5 slow oscillations up-state were 
identified as the critical time window of memory reactivation. However, while in chapter 
4, memory reactivation (of the second sequence element) was nested in the slow 
oscillations up-state, in chapter 5, memory reactivation was nested in the slow oscillations 
up-state when spindles co-occurred. Solitary slow oscillations, without an accompanied 
sleep spindle, did not synchronise reactivation of previously encoded memories. Directly 
comparing both studies and drawing conclusions about slow oscillation-sleep spindle 
coupling in respect to sequential memory reactivation is difficult. Analysing slow 
oscillation-sleep spindle coupling in chapter 4 was limited due to a low number of 
spindles evoked by sound cues. A full night study design potentially results in a higher 
number of spindles evoked by sound cues and is more suitable to address the importance 
of slow oscillation-sleep spindle coupling for sequential memory reactivation.   
Owing to the limited spatial resolution of scalp EEG, we cannot draw reliable conclusions 
about hippocampal activity and hippocampal ripples. fMRI and/or iEEG are more 

 
163 
suitable to capture hippocampal activity/ripples and should be leveraged to elaborate the 
interplay between the cortex and hippocampus as well as the interplay between slow 
oscillations, sleep spindles and ripples during sleep-dependent memory consolidation.   
2. (In)consistency across studies 
2.1. Sequence memories benefit from post-encoding sleep 
Naturalistic, episodic memories incorporate both spatial locations and also the temporal 
sequence of events. Yet, declarative memory tasks often measure memory for spatial 
locations (Kunz et al., 2021; Rudoy et al., 2009; Shrager et al., 2007; Talamini et al., 
2008; Wang et al., 2019) or for temporal sequences of events (DuBrow & Davachi, 2013, 
2016; Ezzyat & Davachi, 2014; Faber & Gennari, 2015; Michelmann et al., 2019; Tubridy 
& Davachi, 2011) rather than a combination of both (but see Herweg et al., 2020; Rauchs 
et al., 2004; Weber, Wang, Born, & Inostroza, 2014). Moreover, research addressing 
consolidation of declarative memories during sleep has mainly focused on memory for 
spatial locations, e.g., associations between objects and spatial locations, and tends to 
neglect memory for temporal sequences or even temporal durations of events. 
Specifically, memory for spatial locations has been repeatedly shown to be consolidated 
during sleep (Cairney, Lindsay, et al., 2018; Noack et al., 2021; Talamini et al., 2008; van 
Dongen et al., 2012), has been associated with sleep spindles (Antony et al., 2018; Creery 
et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2019) and can be strengthened by TMR (Cairney et al., 2016; 
Oudiette et al., 2013; Rudoy et al., 2009). Consolidation of memory for temporal 
sequences, on the other side, has mainly been investigated as a component of procedural 
memories. For example, the finger tapping task or the serial reaction time task require 

 
164 
participants to (explicitly or implicitly) encode a motor sequence by continuously 
pressing the same progression of keys (Povel & Collard, 1982; Robertson, 2007). Both 
tasks have been demonstrated to be sleep-dependent (Brown & Robertson, 2007; B. R. 
King et al., 2017; Walker et al., 2003).  
So far, only a few studies explored to which extent temporal sequences as a component 
of declarative memories are consolidated during sleep (Drosopoulos, Windau, et al., 
2007; Griessenberger et al., 2012). Here, participants had to encode the sequential order 
of images or nouns. Sleep directly following encoding led to superior memory 
performance for the sequential order compared to wake (Drosopoulos, Windau, et al., 
2007; Griessenberger et al., 2012). Building on these findings, we demonstrate in chapter 
2 that temporal sequences of objects were consolidated during post-learning sleep and 
further, in chapter 3, that memory consolidation of temporal sequences was associated 
with an overlap between encoding and spindle topographies. Our results, together with 
the previous findings, suggest that the temporal sequence of events is consolidated during 
sleep.  
The memory paradigm that we developed offers the opportunity, besides measuring 
memory performance for temporal sequences, to also compare sequence and spatial 
memory consolidation or to investigate possible interactions between them. As recent 
literature suggests that both temporal and spatial aspects of memories are represented in 
the hippocampal signal (Herweg et al., 2020) and hippocampus-dependent memories are 
consolidated during sleep (Diekelmann & Born, 2010), one could speculate that both 
temporal and spatial aspects of memories are equally well consolidated during sleep.    

 
165 
In chapter 2 and 3, however, we did not follow up on this research idea as our primary 
interest was to identify one measure which was most sensitive to our memory strength 
manipulation (for a comparison between weakly and strongly encoded memories), which 
appeared to be sequence memory.    
2.2. Sleep actively consolidates memories 
As outlined in the general introduction, within the last century, three different accounts 
for explaining superior memory performance after sleep compared to wake were put 
forward (decay, interference, consolidation account). Both the decay and interference 
account have described sleep as a passive protector of memories against decay or 
interference which merely postpones the deterioration of newly formed memories 
(Ekstrand et al., 1977). The memory consolidation account, on the other side, has 
attributed a more active role to sleep in such a way that physiological processes during 
sleep actively transform newly formed memory traces into stable representations (Born 
& Wilhelm, 2012; Ekstrand et al., 1977; Müller & Pilzecker, 1900). Empirical evidence 
supporting the consolidation account was provided by elegantly designed behavioural 
studies (Gais et al., 2006; Schönauer et al., 2014; Talamini et al., 2008) as well as by 
studies recording brain activity to directly measure these physiological processes during 
sleep (Ji & Wilson, 2007; Niethard et al., 2018; Seibt et al., 2017; Wilson & McNaughton, 
1994). In line with the latter, chapter 3, 4 and 5 recorded brain activity during post-
encoding sleep to further characterise physiological processes underlying sleep-
dependent memory consolidation, i.e., the induction of plasticity by sleep spindles (which 
was tested indirectly) and memory reactivation.  

 
166 
However, the memory consolidation account as the only explanation of superior memory 
performance after sleep has been recently challenged, as memory consolidation and their 
underlying physiological processes have been shown during wake as well. For example, 
memory consolidation not just depends on sleep following learning but also varies as a 
function of retrieval conditions. Actively retrieving memories result in superior memory 
performance and thus, in greater memory consolidation, compared to passively 
restudying them. Furthermore, actively retrieving memories protects them against 
interference (Potts & Shanks, 2012) similar as sleep does (Ellenbogen, Hulbert, et al., 
2006) and a direct comparison between memory performance after a period of sleep, a 
period of wake and a period of wake with retrieval practice revealed a similar large benefit 
of sleep and retrieval practice on memory consolidation (Denis, DiPietro, et al., 2021). 
Based on these findings, it has been argued that active retrieval emulates a consolidation 
process similar to that occurring during sleep (Antony et al., 2017).  
Besides behavioural findings and theories arguing for sleep-like consolidation processes 
during retrieval, physiological processes underlying memory consolidation (induction of 
plasticity and memory reactivation) are not exclusive to sleep and have also been 
observed during wake. According to the active systems consolidation hypothesis, 
memory representations in hippocampus and neocortex are simultaneously reactivated 
during sleep and thus, are redistributed from the hippocampus, a temporary storage of 
memories, to the neocortex, where memories are long-lastingly stored (Born & Wilhelm, 
2012; Diekelmann & Born, 2010). Repeated memory reactivation results in structural 
changes in cortical areas and stabilises the memory trace in the long-term (Klinzing et al., 
2019). Yet, memory reactivation and its relevance for consolidation has been repeatedly 
demonstrated during wake rest and retrieval. More concrete, the re-exposure of encoding-

 
167 
related cues which assumingly triggers reactivation (targeted memory reactivation, TMR) 
also has a stabilizing effect on memory performance when presented during wake 
(Tambini et al., 2017) and resembles TMR effects during sleep (Oudiette & Paller, 2013; 
Rudoy et al., 2009; Schreiner & Rasch, 2015). In the same vein, applying RSA or MVPA 
to brain data revealed memory reactivation of neural patterns activated during encoding 
in subsequent wake rest periods which was further predictive for memory consolidation 
(Schapiro et al., 2018; Schlichtinga & Prestona, 2014). Similarly, neural patterns 
activated during retrieval resembles neural patterns activated during sleep (Schreiner & 
Staudigl, 2020) which further highlights the similarities between memory reactivation 
during retrieval and sleep. Intriguingly, a recent study presented a newly developed 
method to operationalise plastic changes in cortical areas in humans and revealed an 
induction of structural plasticity in cortical areas representing a memory trace already 1 
hour after learning which was free of any sleep (Brodt et al., 2018). Together, these 
findings strongly suggest active memory consolidation during wake.  
If active memory consolidation occurs during both sleep and wakefulness, then how can 
the superior memory performance after sleep compared to wakefulness be explained? 
Memory consolidation starts already during wakefulness and can be triggered by 
rehearsal or retrieval (Himmer et al., 2019). Nevertheless, subsequent sleep is required to 
ensure a further stabilisation of memories. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that 
either the quality of physiological processes underlying memory consolidation or the 
quantity in which they occur differ between wake and sleep states.  
It is yet still unknown to which extent physiological processes underlying sleep and wake-
dependent consolidation are different or alike, whether they are hard-wired and always 
follow the same pattern or whether they flexibly change across the wake-sleep cycle. 

 
168 
Further, the amount of induced plasticity or the number of reactivation events has never 
been compared between sleep and wakefulness leaving it open for future research to 
investigate whether the quantity in which physiological processes occur differ between 
sleep and wakefulness. 
2.3. Sleep spindles & slow oscillations: sometimes coupled and sometimes not 
Sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies on the communication between the 
hippocampus and neocortex that synchronises memory reactivation in both areas and 
thus, enables a redistribution and stabilisation of memory traces (Diekelmann & Born, 
2010; Rasch & Born, 2013). During sleep, the communication between the hippocampus 
and neocortex is thought to be facilitated by an interplay of slow oscillations, sleep 
spindles and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (Helfrich et al., 2019; Klinzing et al., 2019; 
Staresina et al., 2015). Slow oscillations are changes between neuronal excitation and 
inhibition in cortical as well as subcortical areas (Isomura et al., 2006; Timofeev, 2011). 
They initiate the generation of thalamic spindles that propagate to the neocortex where 
they are nested in the up-state of slow oscillations and to the hippocampus where they 
synchronise hippocampal ripples in their troughs (Ngo et al., 2020; Staresina et al., 2015). 
Thus, the simultaneous occurrence of all three cardinal sleep oscillations enables 
synchronised memory reactivation in hippocampal and cortical sites (Helfrich et al., 
2019; Ngo et al., 2020) and subserve memory consolidation (Hahn et al., 2020; Helfrich 
et al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019).  
In chapter 3 and 5, coupling between slow oscillations and sleep spindles was investigated 
and the results are somewhat inconsistent. In chapter 3, our main finding revealed that 
sleep spindles track encoding patterns in favour of memory consolidation, assumingly by 

 
169 
an induction of plasticity in these encoding-related areas. While recent evidence (Hahn et 
al., 2020; Helfrich et al., 2018; Muehlroth et al., 2019) and our results of chapter 5 
highlight the importance of slow oscillation-sleep spindle coupling for memory 
consolidation and reactivation, in chapter 3 we found that sleep spindles track encoding 
patterns independently of whether they are coupled or not.  
Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that spindle topographies were unaffected by 
concurrent SO topographies (Klinzing et al., 2016) and theoretical and computational 
models (Sejnowski & Destexhe, 2000; Wei et al., 2018) propose a sequential 
consolidation process with sleep spindles and slow oscillations acting at different stages 
in the process. Together, this evidence raises the possibility that (synaptic) consolidation 
of encoding patterns relies, at least partly, on sleep spindles independently of slow 
oscillations.  
It is reasonable to assume that sleep spindles fulfil different mechanistic functions which 
are potentially influenced by their co-occurrence with slow oscillations and hippocampal 
sharp-wave ripples. First, sleep spindles offer an optional time window for the induction 
of synaptic plasticity (Peyrache & Seibt, 2020). To ensure an efficient induction of 
synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks, no new input should be simultaneously 
processed as it results in interference and disrupts the consolidation process. Interestingly, 
presenting sound cues during sleep spindles results in a diminished brain response (Dang-
Vu et al., 2011) and high gamma power is accompanied by a higher arousal threshold to 
sound cues (Lecci et al., 2017), suggesting that the brain is less responsive to external 
cues during sleep spindles. In the same vein, theoretical approaches argue for less 
information processing during oscillations such as alpha oscillations (Hanslmayr et al., 
2012, 2016) or sleep spindles (Helfrich et al., 2021). Oscillations reflect highly 

 
170 
synchronised neuronal activity across brain regions, but information processing requires 
variance in neuronal activity to code information. Variance in neuronal activity is present 
during desynchronised brain states which then enables the (re-) processing of old and new 
information (Hanslmayr et al., 2012, 2016; Helfrich et al., 2021). Sleep spindles as a 
synchronised brain state offer perfect conditions for the induction of plasticity due to 
reduced information processing of new information. To which extent a coupling of sleep 
spindles with slow oscillations or hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, however, is relevant 
for the induction of plasticity is still elusive. While a recent rodent study demonstrated 
that Ca2+ activity is increased threefold when spindles were coupled to slow oscillations 
(Niethard et al., 2018), other studies linked sleep spindles in general to plastic changes 
(Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005; Seibt et al., 2017). Sleep spindles are prime vehicles for 
plastic changes. It is yet to be explored how the coupling of sleep spindles to other 
cardinal sleep oscillations influences the amount of induced plasticity.  
Besides offering a time window for the induction of plasticity, sleep spindles are also 
involved in triggering and synchronising memory reactivation across brain areas 
(Helfrich et al., 2019; Ngo et al., 2020). Plastic changes can occur during solitary sleep 
spindles (Rosanova & Ulrich, 2005; Seibt et al., 2017). Yet, memory reactivation requires 
the co-occurrence of sleep spindles with slow oscillations and sharp-wave ripples 
(Latchoumane et al., 2017; Maingret et al., 2016). According to the previously described 
theoretical approaches  (Hanslmayr et al., 2012, 2016; Helfrich et al., 2021) which argue 
for increased information processing during desynchronised brain activity, memory 
reactivation should ideally occur before or after sleep spindles. Indeed, recent evidence 
suggest an increased information processing after sleep spindles by demonstrating that 
the presentation of a sound cue directly following a sleep spindle (< 1sec) disrupts the 

 
171 
information process and leads to more forgetting (Antony et al., 2018). Similarly, the 
benefits of presenting sound cues during sleep (and the induction of slow oscillations and 
sleep spindles) was blocked when a second sound was presented shortly after (Schreiner 
et al., 2015). In line with this findings, in chapter 5 we found that memory reactivation, 
in the grand average, peaked shortly after coupled sleep spindles pointing to an increase 
in information processing after, not during sleep spindles (but see Cairney, Guttesen, El 
Marj, & Staresina, 2018).  
Together, these two mechanistic functions that can be ascribed to sleep spindles explain 
the discrepancies between results of chapter 3 and 5. One could speculate that solitary as 
well as coupled sleep spindles induce plasticity in encoding-related areas (chapter 3) but 
that sleep spindles coupled to slow oscillations are required to trigger memory 
reactivation (chapter 5).  
A key open question for future research is how memory reactivation and the induction of 
plasticity interact with each other. Is memory reactivation directly followed by plastic 
changes? If not, how long can it take for plastic changes to be induced without disrupting 
the consolidation of the reactivated memory trace? Is there a sequential consolidation 
process during which memory reactivation always happens first and the induction of 
plasticity always follows? To date, direct relations between memory reactivation and 
plastic changes are rare due to different methods required to measure both. For example, 
while plastic changes have been measured using two-photon calcium imaging in rodents 
(Niethard et al., 2018), memory reactivation has been investigated using recently 
developed methods like MVPA and RSA (Cairney, Guttesen, et al., 2018; Schreiner et 
al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Building on a very recently developed method enabling to 
measure plastic changes in humans (Brodt et al., 2018), the simultaneous investigation of 

 
172 
memory reactivation and plastic changes throughout a period of sleep might soon be 
possible.   
3. Concluding remarks 
During the last century, the significance of sleep for memory consolidation has been 
established. While the intricate brain mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent memory 
consolidation remained theoretical for a long time, the recent development of new 
methods has enabled their empirical investigation. By exploiting these methods together 
with the development of a new memory paradigm, this thesis further the understanding 
of mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent memory consolidation and relate them to 
cardinal brain oscillations during sleep, i.e., slow oscillations and sleep spindles.  
Sleep spindles have been previously identified as a vehicle to induce plasticity. In the first 
part of the thesis (chapter 2 and 3), it is demonstrated that memory consolidation can be 
explained by sleep spindles tracking cortical patterns active during learning ascribing a 
mechanistic function to sleep spindles for memory consolidation. That is, sleep spindles 
specifically occur in encoding relevant cortical areas to facilitate consolidation, 
assumingly by inducing long-lasting changes (plasticity) in these areas.  
In the second part of the thesis (chapter 4 and 5), slow oscillations and sleep spindles have 
been linked to another mechanism underlying sleep-dependent memory consolidation, 
memory reactivation. In both chapters, slow oscillations up-states were identified as the 
critical time window for memory reactivation, whereas the last chapter additionally 

 
173 
demonstrate that the precise coupling between slow oscillations and sleep spindles 
predicts memory reactivation strength.    
Together, this thesis provides important insights into the mechanisms subserving 
associative memory consolidation during sleep, raises new interesting research questions 
and hopefully stimulates future work to further investigate both mechanisms 
independently but also in relation to each other.
