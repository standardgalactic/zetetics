A quantum complexity lower bound from 
differential geometry
Adam R. Brown 
  1,2 
Differential geometry has long found applications in physics in general 
relativity and related areas. More recently, it was proposed by Nielsen that 
the tools of differential geometry, when applied to the unitary group, might 
be used to bound the complexity of quantum operations. The Bishop–
Gromov bound—a cousin of the focusing lemmas used to prove the Penrose–
Hawking black hole singularity theorems—is a differential geometry result 
that gives an upper bound on the rate of growth of the volume of geodesic 
balls in terms of the Ricci curvature. Here I apply the Bishop–Gromov bound 
to Nielsen’s complexity geometry to prove lower bounds on the quantum 
complexity of a typical unitary. For a broad class of models, the typical 
complexity is shown to be exponentially large in the number of qubits. This 
technique gives results that are tighter than all known lower bounds in the 
literature, as well as establishing lower bounds for a much broader class of 
complexity geometry metrics than has hitherto been bounded. This method 
thus realizes the original vision of Nielsen, which was to apply the tools of 
differential geometry to study quantum complexity.
Geometric ideas were introduced into the study of quantum complexity 
by Nielsen and collaborators1–5. Their vision was that by considering a 
definition of complexity that replaces quantum gates with a smooth 
path through unitary space, the tools of differential geometry might 
be brought to bear on proving complexity lower bounds. So far this 
vision has not been realized. Here I will use a theorem from differential 
geometry—the Bishop–Gromov bound6, (https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Bishop-Gromov_inequality)—to prove a complexity lower bound 
for the complexity geometry. I address the following basic question: 
for the complexity geometry on N qubits, does the complexity of a 
typical operator grow exponentially with N? For one particular com-
plexity geometry—what below I will call the ‘cliff’ metric—this question 
has already been answered in the affirmative by Nielsen et al.2, using 
a non-geometric technique that leverages previous results from gate 
complexity. Here I will use a tool from differential geometry to red-
erive this result in a way that makes no mention of gates, ϵ balls or error 
budgets, and improves the exponent. I will argue that my improved 
lower bound is tight. Next, I will apply this technique to many differ-
ent complexity geometries, and show that for a broad class of metrics, 
many much less highly curved than the cliff metric, the complexity of 
a typical unitary is still exponential in N.
Review of gate complexity and complexity 
geometry
The complexity of a transformation quantifies how hard it is to imple-
ment. The group of transformations we will be interested in implement-
ing is U(2N), the purity-preserving linear functions on N qubits. Let us 
consider two different sets of primitive operations we might use to 
build elements of this group, which will yield two different definitions 
of complexity.
Gate complexity
For gate complexity, we compile complex unitaries by arranging gates 
in a circuit. Usually the primitive gates may only act on a small number 
(often two) of qubits at a time. There may either be a discrete set of 
primitive gates (for example, CNOT plus Hadamard plus a random 
phase are known to be universal7) or a continuous set (for example, we 
may permit any transformation U(22) on the two qubits). The value of

since equation (3) has an L2 norm. Finally, notice that the metric equa-
tion (3) is ‘right-invariant’, which means the distance from  to U is the 
same as the distance from UR to UUR, as a consequence of which the 
complexity geometry is homogeneous.
We want to know the complexity of a typical operator as a function 
of N and the penalty schedule ℐk. Unlike for gate complexity, we cannot 
just count. We cannot count points because the number of points 
reachable by even an arbitrarily short path is uncountable. Moreover, 
we cannot even count dimensions, since there is no restriction on how 
often the path may change direction, so the dimensionality of the space 
of even arbitrarily short paths is infinity. To find a lower bound to the 
complexity of a typical unitary, we cannot use counting. Instead we 
must measure volume. But first let us note some useful lemmas.
The first useful lemma is that the cliff-metric complexity distance 
is upper bounded by the gate complexity. This is because any 
at-most-2-qubit gate (that is, any element of U(22)) can be synthesized 
by evolving with an at-most-2-local Hamiltonian for a Killing distance 
of at most π. Thus, even for the ‘infinite-cliff’ metric ℐk≤2 = 1, ℐk≥3 = ∞, 
the distance to a given unitary is never more than π times the number 
of 1- and 2-local gates in the smallest circuit that reaches the  
same unitary,
𝒞𝒞geom,cliff[U] ≤π 𝒞𝒞gates[U]
(4)
The second useful lemma relates distances in two different com-
plexity geometries. The more expensive penalty schedule must have 
concomitantly longer distances, so
∀k, ̄ℐk ≥ℐk →𝒞𝒞geom, ̄ℐk[U] ≥𝒞𝒞geom,ℐk[U]
(5)
As a special case, increasing every ℐk in a penalty schedule to be equal 
to the maximum penalty, ̄ℐk = maxkℐk, gives a rescaled version of the 
Killing metric, and so upper bounds
𝒞𝒞geom,ℐk[U] ≤𝜋𝜋maxk√ℐk
(6)
The Bishop–Gromov bound
The volume of a geodesic ball of radius 𝒞 in d-dimensional hyperbolic 
space is given by volumeBG(𝒞𝒞𝒞 where, for unit vectors X,
volumeBG(𝒞𝒞𝒞
≡Ωd−1 ∫
𝒞𝒞
0 dτ (√
d−1
−minX[ℛμνXμXν] sinh [ √−minX[ℛμνXμXν]

d−1
(7)
Since hyperbolic space is isotropic, the ‘min’ here is redundant as 
the Ricci curvature is the same in all directions (and so ℛμνXμXν is inde-
pendent of X). However, the Bishop–Gromov theorem6, (https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop-Gromov_inequality) says that this same 
expression upper bounds the volume of geodesic balls in any 
d-dimensional homogeneous space, even when it is not isotropic
Bishop−Gromov theorem∶
volumeball(𝒞𝒞𝒞≤volumeBG(𝒞𝒞𝒞𝒞
(8)
Although calculating the exact volume of the geodesic ball is hard, the 
Bishop–Gromov theorem gives a simple upper bound in terms of a sin-
gle local geometric quantity. (For mathematicians, the Bishop–Gromov 
bound is a venerable ‘comparison theorem’ of differential geometry 
that needs no introduction, but physicists may find it helpful to think 
of it as arising from the (d + 0)-dimensional Raychaudhuri equation21, 
as discussed in the Supplementary Information.)
Proof strategy overview
Our proof strategy is, schematically,
the complexity is then the number of primitive gates required to build 
the target unitary.
We are interested in the number of gates required to synthesize 
typical elements of U(2N). For a discrete gate set, we must introduce a 
tolerance ϵ if we aspire to reach every element, whereas for a continu-
ous gate set we can hit every element exactly. Either way, we can derive 
an exponential lower bound just by counting. For discrete gates, we 
count the number of ϵ balls in U(2N), namely eO(log[ϵ−1]4N), and then count 
the number of different circuits with 𝒞 gates, eO(𝒞𝒞log[N]); for continuous 
gate sets we count the number of degrees of freedom in U(2N), namely 
4N, and then count the dimensionality of the space of gates, O(1); in 
both cases, therefore, we cannot hope to have fully explored the major-
ity of the unitary group until
𝒞𝒞gates[U(2N𝒞] ≳4N
(1)
For many sets of primitive gates (including the continuous 
two-qubit gate set U(22)) we can, with a little more work, prove that 
this complexity lower bound is approximately tight. For gate complex-
ity the question of the complexity of a typical unitary thus has a simple 
and settled answer. Not so for complexity geometry.
Complexity geometry
Complexity geometry introduces a new metric on the unitary group 
that stretches directions that are hard to move in, so that complex 
unitaries are pushed farther away1–5. The complexity of a unitary may 
then be defined as the length of the shortest path connecting U to the 
identity. We thus compile a complex unitary by gliding through U(2N) on 
a continuous path, guided by a (possibly time-dependent) Hamiltonian.
A complete basis for the Hamiltonians in the tangent space of U(2N) 
is given by the generalized-Pauli operators. A k-local generalized-Pauli 
operator σI is the product of k single-qubit Pauli operators and N − k 
identity operators that act on the other qubits. For example, 
(σx𝒞1 ⊗
2 ⊗(σy𝒞3 ⊗(σy𝒞4 ⊗
5 ⊗… ⊗
N is a 3-local generalized-Pauli 
operator, where the numerical subscript indicates which qubit the 
operator acts on. There are

∑
N
k=0 ( N

4N. In this basis, the complexity 
distance between U and U + dU is then defined by1
ds2 = ∑
IJ
Tr[i dU U†σI]ℐIJTr[i dU U†σJ]
(3)
(See also Section 1 of ref. 8 for a pedagogical introduction and refs. 9–20  
for other recent work.) Here we have normalized the trace so that 
Tr
= 1 and ℐIJ is a positive-definite matrix. Were ℐIJ the identity matrix, 
ℐIJ = δIJ, this would recover the standard ‘bi-invariant’ Riemannian 
metric—sometimes called the ‘Killing metric’—on U(2N), which has a 
maximum separation (diameter) of π. In the Killing metric, it is equally 
‘easy’ to move in any direction. In the complexity geometry, we change 
ℐIJ so that while it may still be inexpensive to move in some directions 
(for example, in the directions of Hamiltonians that act non-trivially 
on only two qubits), other directions may be assigned a large ‘penalty 
factor’ ℐIJ to reflect that moving in highly non-local directions is hard. 
The ℐIJ we will consider here will be diagonal in the generalized-Pauli 
basis, and will have a diagonal value that depends only on the k locality, 
so that the metric is fully specified by the ‘penalty schedule’ ℐk that 
assigns a penalty factor to each value of k ≤ N. The infinitesimal distance 
in off-diagonal directions is then determined by Pythagoras’ theorem,

Here ωd is the volume of the unit d = 4N-dimensional unitary group 
U(2N) with the bi-invariant metric, ℐk = 1, and the quantity in the square-
root is the determinant of the metric. Since the complexity of an opera-
tor is defined as its geometric distance from the identity, the volume 
of unitaries with complexity less than 𝒞 is simply the volume of the 
geodesic ball with radius 𝒞. We cannot hope to be able to synthesize 
the median unitary until this geodesic ball has engulfed (half of)

In summary, our proof strategy for bounding below the complexity 
distance one must travel to reach a typical unitary will be by observing 
in equation (10) that the volume of the whole complexity geometry 
is huge, and then observing in equation (8) that the volume of the 
ball made by shooting geodesics out from a point in every direction 
does not grow very fast as a function of its radius. Combining these 
observations tells us that a geodesic ball must have a ginormous radius 
before it can hope to have encompassed an appreciable fraction of the 
complexity geometry.
The Ricci curvature
To evaluate the Bishop–Gromov bound, we must calculate the most neg-
ative component of the Ricci curvature. The curvature of right-invariant 
metrics was investigated by Milnor22 (note mathematicians use the 
mirror convention and call them ‘left-invariant’). As recounted in the 
Supplementary Information, the Ricci curvature is diagonal in the 
generalized-Pauli basis and given by

(13)
Define #overlapsame as the number of qubits to which σI and σJ assign 
the same SU(2) Pauli operators (σx, σy or σz) and #overlapdiff. as the num-
ber of qubits to which they both assign a Pauli operator (that is, not ) 
but the Pauli operators are different. Then 
1
4Tr([σI, σJ]
2𝒞 will be 1 if #over-
lapdiff. is odd and 0 otherwise. When the commutator is non-zero it is 
another generalized-Pauli operator with weight
weight([σI, σJ]𝒞= weight(σI𝒞+ weight(σJ𝒞
−#overlapdiff. −2#overlapsame
(14)
These formulae, plus some combinatorics, are sufficient to calcu-
late the Ricci curvature for every direction and every penalty schedule.
Approximations
The Bishop–Gromov technique can give a precise lower bound, but 
here we will extract only the exponential behaviour in N. This will allow 
us to make a number of simplifications.
First, since we are interested in a lower bound, we will drop the 
positive term in equation (13). Since 
1
2[σI, (
1
2[σI, σJ]𝒞] = σJ  (or zero 
when σI and σJ commute) we can reorder the sum to write

Second, to make the double-exponentially large terms more man-
ageable, we can take the 4Nth root of equation (12), which to good 
approximation becomes

high-dimensional negatively curved space, geodesic balls grow so 
rapidly that the bounds we can place on the typical complexity are very 
close to the bounds we can place on the worst-case complexity (the 
‘diameter’), and henceforth we will elide the two. We can also neglect 
the difference between the volume of the unit unitary ω4N and the vol-

Complexity lower bounds for specific metrics
In the Supplementary Information, I apply the main result of this 
article, equation (17), to a number of specific metrics. The results are 
summarized in Table. 1. For the particular example of the cliff metric, 
ℐ1 = ℐ2 = 1, ℐk≥3 = ℐmax, the bound as a function of ℐmax is plotted  
in Fig. 1.
Discussion
Here I used the Bishop–Gromov theorem to find a lower bound to the 
complexity of a typical unitary in the complexity geometry, for a range 
of penalty schedules. We saw that the Bishop–Gromov technique was 
able to prove a lower bound of 4N/2 for the cliff schedule, and also lower 
bounds for the other schedules that were also exponential in N. For 
the special case of the cliff metric (and unlike for the other metrics), 
there was already an exponential lower bound known due to the work 
of Nielsen et al.2, namely 4N/3. Both this article and ref. 2 use methods 
that are non-constructive, in the sense that even though both assure 
you that almost all unitaries are highly complex, neither presents you 
with a certified hard unitary. However my method is non-constructive 
even given an oracle for gate complexity, whereas ref. 2 proved that if 
a unitary is exponentially hard to approximate in gate complexity, it 
is also exponentially hard to reach in the cliff metric.
In the literature, there have been two major motivations for study-
ing complexity geometry. The original motivation1–4 saw complexity

geometry as having instrumental value, as a tool for proving results 
about the ‘true’ definition of complexity—gate complexity. I will return 
to this motivation below, where I will discuss the ways in which the 
results of this article contribute to that programme. The more recent 
motivation has seen complexity geometry as having intrinsic value, as 
a definition of complexity in its own right that is in many ways superior 
to the gate definition. This second motivation has been particularly 
prevalent amongst those who study the holographic complexity con-
jectures23–26, in which the numerical value of the complexity is given 
physical significance, and to which the complexity geometry definition 
seems well adapted.
However, for reasons first articulated in ref. 27, the cliff metric 
itself does not provide a promising definition for use in holographic 
complexity. This is because the cliff metric has huge sectional curva-
ture, and so does not capture for example the ‘switch back’ behaviour 
visible in holographic shockwaves. In ref. 27 it was pointed out that  
the exponential metric, discussed in the Supplementary Information, 
has only modest sectional curvatures and is a natural candidate to 
underpin holographic complexity. (The binomial metric, also discussed 
in the Supplementary Information, also has modest sectional curva-
tures.) But there was a gap in the argument. The original inspiration for 
conjecturing that complexity was the quantity holographically dual to 
the size of a wormhole23 was precisely that; like the size of a wormhole, 
complexity is a quantity that can grow exponentially large. However, 
there was no metric that was known both to have modest sectional 
curvature and to have exponential diameter. That gap is now closed.
The results of this article also provide evidence in favour of the 
geometrical conjectures described in ref. 28. In that article, my col-
laborators and I laid out the evidence that there exists a kind of uni-
versality in high-dimensional right-invariant geometries, in which 
the long-distance behaviour of the distance function is surprisingly 
insensitive to the short-distance properties of the metric. This article 
has provided a consistency check on these ideas by showing that there 
is a large class of schedules, all of which give exponential diameters.
The Bishop–Gromov theorem gives a strong bound on the volume 
growth only when the most negative component of the Ricci curvature 
is modest. Nevertheless, I was able to give exponential lower bounds 
on the diameter even for some metrics that have immodestly negative 
Ricci curvature. This is because of equation (5), which is a key idea here. 
This inequality tells us that if one penalty schedule is more expensive 
than another (that is, assigns a larger penalty factor to every basis 
direction), then the more expensive penalty schedule must give a larger 
diameter. Thus to find a lower bound for the diameter of a highly curved 
metric one can first find a less expensive metric that has modest cur-
vature, and then use the Bishop–Gromov theorem to bound the diam-
eter of the cheaper metric. For example, consider the cliff metric in the 
limit that ℐk≥3 = q grows towards infinity. The most negative compo-
nent of the Ricci curvature is approximately −q, so in this limit the 
Bishop–Gromov bound has no purchase. Nevertheless, we saw in Fig. 1  
that I was able to bound the diameter by using the Bishop–Gromov 
theorem on the q = 2N cliff metric and then arguing that increasing q 
can only increase the diameter. Similarly, using equation (5) I was also 
able to bound the diameters of the ‘exponential’ and ‘binomial’ metrics 
by ‘truncating’ the schedules to give them smaller Ricci curvature. Such 
is the power of equation (5) that it is reasonable to conjecture that 
whenever a penalty schedule ℐk has exponential diameter, the Bishop–
Gromov technique can prove it has exponential diameter.
As well as bounding how complex typical unitaries are, the 
Bishop–Gromov theorem may also be used to quantify how atypical 
low-complexity unitaries are. The Bishop–Gromov theorem ‘natively’ 
upper bounds the volume of unitaries with complexity less than a given 
value, but it can also be used to give a lower bound, because of the theo-
rem that6, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop-Gromov_inequality)

(18)
This inequality means that if the growth of the geodesic ball ever 
falls behind the Bishop–Gromov pace, then it can never catch up. Since 
we know that the geodesic ball must have engulfed the whole space by 
the time the diameter is reached, and since we can find an upper bound 
for the diameter (see, for example, equation (6)), this allows us to find 
a lower bound to the volume growth.
The technique developed here should also be able to find a lower 
bound for the diameters of right-invariant metrics on other compact 
Lie groups, in addition to the unitary group. I have focused on the uni-
tary group because it has been the subject of the most previous study, 
and because it is the group most applicable to quantum complexity.
Let us make a mathematical conjecture. In Fig. 1, we saw that for 
the cliff metric with q < 4N the Bishop–Gromov bound was able to 
determine (the exponential part of) the diameter exactly, whereas for 
q > 4N there was a gap between the upper bound and the Bishop–Gro-
mov lower bound. My conjecture is that the Bishop–Gromov lower 
bound is tight:
Conjecture∶the infinite-cliff metric (ℐk≤2 = 1, ℐk≥3
= ∞𝒞has diameter 2N
(19)
Let us describe two pieces of circumstantial evidence in favour of  
this conjecture.
The first piece of evidence is that the Bishop–Gromov bound can-
not be tightened further. In the Supplementary Information, I show 
that by using a ‘staircase’ technique, we can enhance the Bishop–Gro-
mov lower bound on the complexity of the cliff metric from the naive 
2
N
2 to the improved 2N. This is as good as it gets: there is no better shape 
for the staircase that gives an even stronger lower bound. Equation (17) 
tells us that to get a lower bound above 2N we need both min ⃗X[ℛμνXμXν] 
to be exponentially small (or positive) and ℐmax > 4N. However, if 
ℐ2 = 1 and ℐmax > 4N, then there must exist k such that ℐk > 4ℐk−1. 
Equation (15) tells us that this value of k will make at least an O(1) nega-
tive contribution to ℛ2
2. To turn this into a rigorous proof, we need to 
confirm that the positive terms in equation (13) cannot fully cancel 
these negative contributions, and thereby give an upper bound on the 
most negative component of the Ricci curvature when there is a suf-
ficiently large ratio between ℐ2 and ℐmax.

For the second piece of circumstantial evidence, consider a new 
definition of complexity I will call zig-zagδ complexity. In zig-zagδ 
complexity you move in piecewise-linear segments. Within each seg-
ment, you move with a fixed TrH2 ≤ 1 time-independent 2-local Hamil-
tonian, for a Killing distance δ. Then for the next segment you pick some 
new fixed 2-local Hamiltonian. The complexity of a path is defined as 
𝒞= Sδ, where S is the number of segments. This definition interpolates 
between the infinite-cliff complexity geometry when δ = 0 and a model 
that is only somewhat more powerful than the gate definition when 
δ = π. To reach every point, simple dimension-counting tells us we need 
S ≳ 4N, so that we have enough ‘fine motor skills’ to fill out the dimen-
sionality of the neighbourhood of a point. However, even for S = 4N, if 
δ is too small we do not have enough ‘gross motor skills’ to reach every 
ϵ ball. Consider starting with a complexity geometry path and 
‘coarse-graining’ into a zig-zagδ path by dividing up the path into seg-
ments of length δ, and within each segment applying the time-average 
Hamiltonian. This introduces a per-segment Killing error of about δ2, 
for a total Killing error of Sδ2. This suggests that the critical values are 
S = 4N and δ = 2−N, and that the zig-zagδ diameter of the unitary group is 
4Nδ for δ > 2−N and 2N for δ < 2−N. Taking δ → 0 recovers equation (19).
Nielsen’s original vision was to use the tools of differential geome-
try to find a lower bound to the complexity of the complexity geometry, 
and then use that to prove new lower bounds on gate complexity. This 
article has realized the first half of that vision. When I proved complex-
ity lower bounds for the complexity geometry, I also via equation (4) 
implicitly proved lower bounds for gate complexity. But those lower 
bounds were too weak to be new. The problem is that the gate definition 
of complexity is so much less permissive than the complexity geom-
etry definition that in this case it is easier to directly prove limitations 
on gate complexity rather than to indirectly prove limitations via the 
complexity geometry. The Bishop–Gromov bound has proven itself 
to be a powerful tool for establishing complexity lower bounds for the 
complexity geometry—and provided an important existence proof 
that it is possible to prove complexity lower bounds using differential 
geometry—but more progress will be required to realize the totality 
of Nielsen’s vision.

Fig. 1 | Diameter bounds for the cliff metric. The (exponential part of the) 
diameter of the cliff metric for N qubits with ℐ1 = ℐ2 = 1, ℐk≥3 = ℐmax, as derived 
in the Supplementary Information. For ℐmax < 4N the (exponential part of the) 
diameter is exactly √ℐmax; for ℐmax > 4N we can bound the diameter above and 
below: the diameter is somewhere in the shaded region. In the discussion section 
I will conjecture that the correct answer is given by the bottom line and the 
Bishop–Gromov lower bound is tight.
