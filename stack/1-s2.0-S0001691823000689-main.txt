The purpose of this study was to examine if prosodic patterns in oral reading derived from Recurrence Quan­
tification Analysis (RQA) could distinguish between struggling and skilled German readers in Grades 2 (n = 67) 
and 4 (n = 69). Furthermore, we investigated whether models estimated with RQA measures outperformed 
models estimated with prosodic features derived from prosodic transcription. According to the findings, strug­
gling second graders appear to have a slower reading rate, longer intervals between pauses, and more repetitions 
of recurrent amplitudes and pauses, whereas struggling fourth graders appear to have less stable pause patterns 
over time, more pitch repetitions, more similar amplitude patterns over time, and more repetitions of pauses. 
Additionally, the models with prosodic patterns outperformed models with prosodic features. These findings 
suggest that the RQA approach provides additional information about prosody that complements an established 
approach.   
1. Introduction 
Thinking back to our school days, we all remember classmates who, 
in comparison to their peers, struggled while reading a passage aloud. 
These students read passages word for word, syllable by syllable, or even 
letter by letter, with long pauses in between, and they took longer than 
most of their peers to complete reading the passage. This observable 
behavior has been described as a lack of reading fluency in reading 
research and by literacy educators (Allington, 1983; Dowhower, 1991). 
Reading fluency has received considerable attention since the Report 
of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
(National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, 2000). 
However, providing a widely accepted definition appears rather chal­
lenging (Godde et al., 2020). A consensus exists that reading fluency is a 
complex, multifaceted construct, which mainly relies on word recogni­
tion accuracy, automaticity, and prosody (e.g., Hudson et al., 2009; 
Kuhn et al., 2010). Nonetheless, the contribution of each factor to 
reading fluency remains disputed (Kuhn et al., 2010). Despite the ample 
research on reading fluency, it tends to focus on accuracy and automa­
ticity (e.g., Fuchs et al., 2001; Kara et al., 2020), whereas prosody is 
frequently overlooked (Silverman et al., 2013; Wolters et al., 2020). 
According to Dowhower (1991), one possible explanation for the neglect 
of prosody could be that measuring word reading accuracy and word 
reading speed is easier and less time consuming than measuring pros­
ody. In the present study, we employed Recurrence Quantification Anal­
ysis (RQA – Marwan et al., 2007; Wallot et al., 2014) and k-fold cross- 
validation analysis (Browne, 2000) to explore the differences in the 
prosodic patterns of skilled and struggling German readers in second and 
fourth grade. We were particularly interested in identifying prosodic 
patterns that can distinguish between skilled and struggling German 
readers. Furthermore, we investigated whether these prosodic patterns 
could distinguish between struggling and skilled German readers better

than prosodic features, such as appropriate and inappropriate pause 
occurrences acquired from prosodic transcription. In the following sec­
tions, we briefly describe word-reading automaticity, word-reading 
prosody, and the presently available methods to assess prosody, which 
provides the groundwork for our study. 
1.1. Word Reading automaticity and prosody 
Many researchers regard fluency as more or less synonymous with 
word reading automaticity (Dowhower, 1991). Word reading automa­
ticity reflects the ability to recognize words accurately and with minimal 
cognitive effort (Paige et al., 2014). The number of words correctly read 
per minute, which incorporates both word reading accuracy and word 
reading speed, is a common metric of word reading automaticity 
(Benjamin & Schwanenflugel, 2010). Nevertheless, achieving a word 
recognition accuracy threshold is an important precondition before 
word reading speed starts improving (Altani et al., 2020; Juul et al., 
2014; Karageorgos et al., 2019, 2020). For readers who lack a high level 
of word reading accuracy, word recognition will most likely be ineffi­
cient, resulting in a high demand on cognitive resources and slow 
reading speed (Castles et al., 2018; LaBerge & Samuels, 1974). Hence, 
before readers recognize words efficiently, they must first learn the 
grapheme-phoneme correspondence rules and start making use of syl­
lables (Coltheart et al., 2001). 
Even though word reading automaticity is necessary for reading 
fluency and reading comprehension in early primary school (e.g., Ehri, 
2005; Miller & Schwanenflugel, 2008), it is not sufficient (Kuhn et al., 
2010). Prosody, which “refers to reading with expression” (Rasinski 
et al., 2009, p. 351), is also considered by many reading researchers to 
be a key component of reading fluency (e.g., Dowhower, 1991; Hudson 
et al., 2009). Several studies have found a direct positive relationship 
between prosody and reading comprehension (e.g., Benjamin & 
Schwanenflugel, 2010; Rasinski et al., 2009). As a result, reading pros­
ody may deserve closer attention than it currently receives. 
According to Kuhn et al. (2010; see also Couper-Kuhlen, 1986), four 
well-established prosodic features describe the quality of prosody as 
variations in a) pitch, b) duration, c) stress, and d) pausing. Pitch, which is 
also referred to as intonation or fundamental frequency, could be 
described as the rate of vibration of a speaker's vocal folds (Dowhower, 
1991). Pitch appears to depend on a variety of factors such as the lan­
guage or even the dialect of the same language (e.g., Mennen et al., 
2014). In a cross-language comparison, Mennen et al. (2012) found 
significant differences in pitch span between English and German female 
monolingual speakers. English female speakers had a higher pitch at the 
start of a phrase and showed more pitch variations than German female 
speakers (see also Scharff-Rethfeldt et al., 2008). Given that no apparent 
organic or physiological differences existed between the two groups, 
pitch changes could be traced back to the spoken language (Mennen 
et al., 2012, 2014). 
Pitch may also vary depending on a speaker's gender, with men 
having lower fundamental frequencies than women (e.g., Hillenbrand & 
Clark, 2009; Lee et al., 1999; Titze, 1989). Lee et al. (1999) found in 
their study with children speaking American English that these differ­
ences begin to manifest around the age of 11 and are fully established by 
the age of 15. Finally, comparisons between skilled and struggling 
readers in primary school have shown that skilled readers have a larger 
pitch range and more appropriate pitch falls and rises than struggling 
readers (e.g., English: Benjamin et al., 2013; Spanish: ´Alvarez-Ca˜nizo 
et al., 2015). 
The second prosodic feature, duration, refers to the pronunciation 
length of vowels and syllables and is usually measured in milliseconds 
(Kuhn et al., 2010). Duration may depend on a variety of factors. For 
example, vowels in stressed words have longer pronunciations than 
vowels in unstressed words (Temperley, 2009). A vowel's pronunciation 
can even be longer during the phrase-final lengthening, which is the 
lengthening of the vowel at the final position of a phrase (e.g., 
Dowhower, 1987, 1991; Edwards et al., 1991; Turk & Shattuck- 
Hufnagel, 2007). Research has shown that appropriate phrase-final 
lengthening is a good indicator of readers chunking the reading mate­
rial (Cooper & Cooper, 1980; Dowhower, 1991), which enhances 
reading comprehension (Stevens, 1981). Nevertheless, when comparing 
pronunciations between readers, their individual speaking rate should 
also be assessed. Faster readers have a faster speaking rate and therefore 
shorter segment durations than slower readers (Kuhn et al., 2010). 
The third prosodic feature, stress, refers to the phonetical accentua­
tion with which a vowel or a word is read and is usually measured in dB 
(Ktori et al., 2018). Stressing a syllable is particularly important because 
it aids in the distinction of words at the word and sentence level (Ktori 
et al., 2018). For example, stressing the first or second syllable in English 
could indicate whether the word is a noun or a verb (e.g., the noun 
permit versus the verb permit; Himmelmann & Ladd, 2008). Rhythmic 
patterns and rules may differ between languages (Kuhn et al., 2010). In 
some languages, such as Greek and French, special diacritics on written 
words denote the syllables that should be stressed when reading a pol­
ysyllabic word (Protopapas, 2006), but most written systems lack such 
diacritics and stress might be determined by other rules such as mor­
phemes (Rastle & Coltheart, 2000; see also Ktori et al., 2018). Finally, 
comparisons between English skilled and struggling readers in primary 
school showed differences in the frequency of stresses. Skilled readers 
insert a stress every 4.7 words, whereas struggling readers insert a stress 
in almost every word (Clay & Imlach, 1971; Dowhower, 1991). 
The last important prosodic feature, pausing, refers to the intra- 
sentential and inter-sentential pauses that occur during reading and is 
indicated by a silence in the signal (Kuhn et al., 2010). According to 
Lalain et al. (2016, as cited in Godde et al., 2020), pauses can be 
distinguished into three types: breath pauses, syntactic pauses, and 
hesitation pauses. Breath pauses are indispensable for air intake and 
may also be used as discourse markers (Bailly & Gouvernayre, 2012), 
whereas syntactic pauses support sentence parsing and reading 
comprehension, and hesitation pauses indicate cognitive activity and 
are associated with decoding (Godde et al., 2020). Most studies focus on 
the duration, frequency, and appropriateness of the pauses (e.g., En­
glish: Schwanenflugel et al., 2004; French: Godde et al., 2022), which 
are determined to a large extent by the grammatical structure of the text 
(Bailly & Gouvernayre, 2012; Miller & Schwanenflugel, 2008). In 
addition, the duration of pauses may also vary depending on the spoken 
language. For example, Italian has a shorter average pause duration than 
English, German, and French, whereas Spanish has a longer average 
pause duration than these three languages (Campione & V´eronis, 2002). 
Several findings with primary school children also suggest that skilled 
readers take fewer and shorter pauses (e.g., Miller & Schwanenflugel, 
2006; Schwanenflugel et al., 2004), whereas less skilled readers make 
more inappropriate pauses (e.g., ´Alvarez-Ca˜nizo et al., 2015; Miller & 
Schwanenflugel, 2008). 
In sum, despite differences between the languages in the contribu­
tion of the prosodic features to reading, some similarities can be 
observed when comparing skilled readers to struggling readers. Skilled 
readers in primary school show larger pitch ranges and shorter pause 
durations, more appropriate pitch variations, lengthening and stresses, 
and fewer pauses and stresses compared to struggling readers. 
1.2. Present methods for assessing prosody 
Reading prosody rating scales, spectrographic analyses, and prosodic 
transcription are presently the most common methods used for 
measuring and analysing prosodic qualities (e.g., Kuhn et al., 2010; 
Wolters et al., 2020). However, as it is the case with every research 
method, they come with advantages and disadvantages. In reading 
prosody rating scales, human raters make subjective judgements on how 
readers perform according to certain criteria rubrics (Morrison & Wil­
cox, 2020). Several reading prosody rating scales exist, each one 
focusing on different aspects (e.g., Benjamin et al., 2013; Pinnell et al., 
P. Karageorgos et al.

1995; Rasinski, 2004). According to Wolters et al. (2020), the most 
widely used reading prosody scales are the NAEP oral reading fluency 
scale (Daane et al., 2005; Pinnell et al., 1995) and the Multidimensional 
Fluency Scale (Rasinski, 2004). The NAEP is a 4-point holistic rubric that 
measures phrasing, adherence to the author's syntax, and expressiveness 
(Daane et al., 2005; Pinnell et al., 1995). The Multidimensional Fluency 
Scale is a 16-point analytic rubric, with four dimensions and four criteria 
per dimension. Readers are rated in the dimensions of expression and 
volume, phrasing, smoothness, and pace. The main advantage of these 
rating scales is that they are convenient tools for teachers and can be 
used in the classroom (Miller & Schwanenflugel, 2006). However, some 
of these scales require the raters to be trained before they can use them, 
and rating a single reading session can be time consuming. 
In spectrographic analysis, sound waves are transformed into a visual 
representation which is known as a spectrogram (Schwanenflugel et al., 
2004). Many features, such as stress, pitch, and pause lengths, can be 
extracted using this representation (Molholt, 1990; Schwanenflugel 
et al., 2004). Advances in technology and new software have made 
spectrographic analysis easier, and it allows for a more precise assess­
ment of prosodic features (e.g., Praat by Boersma & Weenink, 2021), but 
it is more complex to use than reading rating scales. The required 
technical skills often exceed those of teachers and reading specialists 
(Kuhn et al., 2010). Furthermore, even though spectrograms are a 
powerful tool, researchers must still examine spectrograms to discern 
patterns in the signal (Molholt, 1990). 
In prosodic transcriptions, transcribers identify and annotate all 
prosodic features by employing a transcription system while listening to 
an audio file. There are several well-known transcription systems for 
prosody, for example, Tones and Break Indices (ToBi, Silverman et al., 
1992) for American English, the Gespr¨achsanalytisches Trans­
kriptionssystem (conversation-analytic transcription system, GAT, Selt­
ing et al., 1998) for German, and the International Transcription System 
for Intonation (INTSINT, Hirst, 1991) for cross-linguistic comparisons 
(Bressem, 2013). These transcription systems divide utterances into 
prosodically marked segments and represent prosodic aspects such as 
changes in pitch, accentuation, and lengthening (Bressem, 2013). 
However, prosodic annotation can be rather challenging. Transcription 
of a signal not only requires much time, it also requires the transcribers 
to be familiar with the corresponding transcription system to avoid 
errors. 
1.3. The present study 
The primary aim of the present study was to investigate potential 
differences in prosodic features and prosodic patterns between skilled 
and struggling German readers in primary school by applying the non- 
linear analysis tool RQA (see Wallot, 2017, for an extensive tutorial). 
Although conventional methods, such as prosodic transcription and 
spectrograms, allow for the investigation of this research question, these 
methods have limitations. The advantage of RQA over these methods is 
the possibility to quantify the complexity of a time-series such as the 
extent that a signal is repetitive, noisy, or stationary. This quantitative 
method produces various metrics that accurately and objectively 
represent a signal's patterns (Wallot, 2017) without the need to manu­
ally search for them in a spectrogram. Thus, with this robust semi- 
automated process, identifying patterns in a signal is faster and less 
error prone. We expected that signals of skilled German readers would 
be more structured and stable and would show a less complex and 
chaotic pattern in all prosodic measures with fewer and shorter pauses 
and stresses than the signals of struggling German readers, which is 
analogous to findings from reading research in which the more struc­
tured word reading times and eye movements are associated with higher 
reading skills and comprehension (Tschense & Wallot, 2022; Wallot 
et al., 2014). 
A secondary aim was to investigate whether the metrics obtained 
with RQA, such as signal patterns and complexity, could better 
distinguish between skilled and struggling readers than metrics derived 
from prosodic transcription. By prosodic transcription, transcribers must 
listen to each signal carefully to be able to identify and annotate each 
prosodic feature. Thus, the method yields data about the frequency of 
prosodic feature occurrences but no information on prosodic patterns. In 
contrast, RQA identifies and quantifies prosodic patterns that cannot be 
easily perceived with the human eye, but whether prosodic patterns can 
distinguish between skilled and struggling readers better than the pro­
sodic features obtained with prosodic transcription is still unclear. RQA 
is strongly data-driven and allows for a semi-automated pattern detec­
tion, whereas prosodic transcription is more theory-driven and requires 
manual coding of each piece of information. Thus, the importance of 
RQA metrics regarding the classification to skilled or struggling reader 
compared to prosodic features obtained with prosodic transcription 
should also be investigated. 
2. Method 
2.1. Participants, procedure and design 
Oral reading data were collected in a subsample of a longitudinal 
study that investigated differential effects of three types of reading 
trainings in peer-tutored learning settings (Müller et al., 2015). A sub­
sample of 67 children in Grade 2 from seven schools (32 girls and 35 
boys, aged from 7.35 to 9.19 years, M = 8.04 years, SD = 0.34) and 69 
children in Grade 4 from eight schools (38 girls and 31 boys, aged from 
9.20 to 12.02 years, M = 10.14 years, SD = 0.57) were selected to 
participate in the present study. Half of the children per grade received a 
reading fluency training, the other half was in the control condition and 
received a training of visuospatial working memory. All parents gave a 
written informed consent for the participation of their children. For 
Grade 2, parents of 49 children reported that their children's first lan­
guage was German, parents of 12 children reported that the first lan­
guage of their children was another language than German and parents 
of six children did not share any information about the first language. 
For Grade 4, parents of 43 children reported that their children's first 
language was German, parents of 14 children reported that the first 
language of their children is other than German and parents of 12 
children did not share any information regarding the first language. 
The study was based on an experimental pre−/posttest design with 
randomization at the class level and was conducted in the urban area of 
Kassel, Germany. Participants were first screened with ELFE 1–6 (Len­
hard & Schneider, 2006) for reading comprehension (see Fig. 1). Five 
children with the lowest scores (hereafter referred to as tutees) and five 
children with the highest scores (hereafter referred to as tutors) in each 
class were chosen for the training. To hold skill differences between 
tutees and tutors constant, the allocation of the children in pairs was 
based on their score ranking. The highest-scoring tutee was paired with 
the highest-scoring tutor, the second-best tutee with the second-best 
tutor, and so forth. In Grade 2, this procedure resulted in 33 tutees 
and 34 tutors, and in Grade 4, it resulted in 35 tutees and 34 tutors. The 
proportion of girls and boys in the tutees and tutors groups was 
approximately equal for Grade 2, χ2(1) = 0.02, p = .90, and Grade 4, χ2 
(1) = 0.74, p = .39. 
2.2. Measures 
2.2.1. Reading comprehension 
Reading comprehension skill was assessed with the computer version 
of the subtest text comprehension of ELFE 1–6 (Lenhard & Schneider, 
2006). The test is a standardized reading comprehension test and is 
widely used in Germany. It consists of 13 short narrative and expository 
texts (two to five sentences) with one to three single-choice questions 
each consisting of four items. The test score is the sum of correct re­
sponses achieved within 7 min. 
P. Karageorgos et al.

2.2.2. Prosody measures 
2.2.2.1. Data collection. The training consisted of 25 sessions, each 
lasting 45 min and occurring in addition to regular school classes twice a 
week. At the 23rd training session children read a story aloud individ­
ually while they were being recorded (this issue will be addressed in the 
discussion). At the end of the session, children were required to answer 
two open-ended questions on the story they had just read (see Fig. 2). 
The story for the second graders was 66 words long (9 sentences) and the 
story for the fourth graders was 108 words long (12 sentences). The LIX 
readability measure of the passage for the second graders was 20.97, and 
of the passage for the fourth graders was 22.89. LIX is a measure of text 
difficulty (Bamberger & Rabin, 1984; Bj¨ornsson, 1968). The measure is 
computed by summing the average length of the sentences in a text and 
the percentage of long words with more than six letters. In German, a 
score of less than 25 indicates that the text has a low complexity and is 
appropriate for first graders (Bamberger & Rabin, 1984) 
Each school had a quiet room where the children read the story, with 
only the student assistant and the child present. The story was written on 
a DIN A4 sheet of paper with the font style Calibri, font size 18, and 1.15 
line spacing. During the session, children wore a headset that was con­
nected to a laptop. The audio was digitally recorded using the Audacity 
software (Version 1.2.6; Audacity Team, 2006). 
2.2.2.2. Data processing for RQA. All signals were processed via a 
custom script in the program MATLAB (Version R2017a; The Math 
Works, 2017). First, in an attempt to reduce the noise in each signal, a 
linear smoothing with equal weight in windows of a 50th of 44,100 Hz 
was conducted. Afterwards, boundaries of pronunciation onsets and 
offsets using an amplitude criterion (see MATLAB script in online sup­
plement) were detected and a cut-off criterion of 50 ms was used to 
identify and remove all pronunciation periods with a shorter duration. 
Hence, sounds such as lip smacking were removed from the signal. 
Finally, all remaining pronunciation periods were concatenated to have 
a continuous signal. This signal was partitioned into the pauses and the 
pronunciation periods to investigate them separately. Pitch was 
extracted with an algorithm based on the Voice Analysis Toolbox in 
MATLAB (Tsanas, 2012). All time series were z-standardized, and the 
phase space was normalized with the help of the Euclidean distance. 
2.2.2.3. Transcription and coding. The lengthening within words, final 
pitch movements of intonation at the end of each phrase, pauses be­
tween and within words of a phrase, pauses between phrases, and 
accentuation were transcribed with the transcription editing software 
EXMARaLDA Partitur Editor (Version 1.4.4.; Schmidt & W¨orner, 2009) 
while applying the GAT transcription system (Selting et al., 1998). The 
GAT transcription system is based on a variety of principles and con­
ventions from various disciplines and provides guidelines for the nota­
tion of wording and prosody of spoken interaction (Selting et al., 1998). 
Based on the GAT transcription, we estimated the number of occurrences 
for lengthening, the inappropriate pauses within and between words of a 
phrase, the appropriate pauses between phrases, the accentuations (i.e., 
syllables that carried a focus accent), and the appropriate final pitch 
movements of intonation (i.e., falling intonations at the end of a sen­
tence). All prosodic features were log transformed to reduce the skew­
ness and then z-standardized. 
3. Results 
3.1. Data analysis 
3.1.1. Recurrence quantification analysis 
To capture the complexity and regularity of reading over time in 
each signal, we used Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA; Marwan 
et al., 2007; Wallot, 2017; Wallot et al., 2014) estimated with the CRP 
toolbox (Version 5.24 [R34]; Marwan, 2022) in the program MATLAB 
(Version R2017a; The Math Works, 2017). RQA is a general nonlinear 
time-series analysis technique (see also Wallot, 2017). The advantage of 
RQA compared to other methods is the possibility to quantify the 
complexity of a time series such as the extent that it is repetitive, noisy, 
or stationary. This quantification is accomplished through the

recurrence plot (Eckmann et al., 1987), which is the visualisation of the 
phase space trajectory of a dynamical system in a square matrix (see 
Fig. 3). The recurrence plot allows the extraction of a comprehensive set 
of measures. Four different recurrence plots for each child were gener­
ated: One for the amplitude of the signal, one for the duration of signal 
segments with amplitude above zero, one for the pitch of the signal, and 
one for the duration of all pauses in the signal. The parameters 
embedding dimension, delay and radius were held constant for each 
variable insuring that the average recurrence rate will be below 10 %. A 
complete list of the parameters can be found in the online supplement 
(see Table S1). The generated plots resulted in the extraction of 48 
different RQA measures (12 variables per plot). Means and standard 
deviations for each signal were also estimated and included in the an­
alyses. In the following text, we briefly describe the most important 
measures of RQA (Marwan & Webber, 2015; Webber & Zbilut, 2005) 
and provide an example for each measure in relation to amplitudes. A 
complete list of the measures can be found in the online supplement (see 
Table S2). 
One of the most common measures of RQA is the recurrence rate 
(Marwan & Webber, 2015). This measure is the proportion of recurrence 
points to the total number of possible points in the recurrence plot 
(Wallot, 2017; see also Fig. 3). Therefore, it indicates the overall ten­
dency of the signal to repeat itself within a specified radius (i.e., how 
often a state is revisited). This measure can range from 0 % to 100 %, 
with the lowest value indicating zero probability of recurrent points, 
whereas the highest value indicates that all points in the plot are 
recurrent. A higher recurrence rate in amplitudes, for example, would 
indicate an overall repetitiveness of amplitudes in the signal, i.e., 
readers insert a lot of stresses. 
Another important measure, percent determinism, refers to the exact 
repetition of a sequence over time and is estimated by dividing the 
recurrence points of the diagonal lines by the total number of recurrence 
points in the recurrence plot (Wallot, 2017; see also Fig. 3). Similar to 
recurrence rate, the larger the value, the more exact repetitions in the 
signal. Put simply, percent determinism is a measure of the proportion of 
data points in the signal that are part of recurring patterns and indicates 
the predictability of the system (Marwan & Webber, 2015). Again, in 
relation to amplitudes, a higher determinism would indicate a more 
predictable system, with readers displaying more stress patterns over 
time. This might be the case if readers stress different words in the same 
way throughout the signal. Furthermore, recurrence rate and deter­
minism of reading times have been shown to be positively related to 
reading skill (O’Brien et al., 2014), and determinism has been shown to 
be predictive of reading comprehension and reading speed (Wallot et al., 
2014). 
The third measure, maximal diagonal line length, refers to the length of 
the longest diagonal line in the recurrence plot apart from the main 
diagonal line (Wallot, 2017; see also Fig. 3). The inverse of this measure 
indicates the divergence of the trajectory segments. The diagonal lines in 
the recurrence plot of a chaotic dynamical system are short, whereas 
diagonal lines in the recurrence plot of a periodic system are longer. 
Therefore, the maximal diagonal line length of amplitudes reflects the 
duration of the signal's longest stress pattern. 
The fourth measure, entropy, is a measure of the complexity of the 
Fig. 3. Example of recurrence plots of amplitudes of (A) a struggling second grader and (B) a skilled fourth grader. Recurrence rate is estimated as the proportion of 
all recurrence points to all cells (without the main diagonal line); Determinism is estimated as the proportion of all diagonal recurrence points, parallel to the main 
diagonal, to all recurrence points (without the main diagonal line); Maximal line length is estimated as the longest non-main diagonal line; Laminarity is estimated as 
the proportion of all vertical recurrence points to all recurrence points; Recurrence interval is estimated by averaging the time needed until a recurrence is occurred.

signal and is computed as the Shannon's entropy of the frequency dis­
tribution of the lengths of diagonal lines (Marwan & Webber, 2015; see 
also Fig. 3). In short, entropy indicates the complexity of the patterns in 
the signal (Fusaroli & Tyl´en, 2016). The lower the entropy, the less 
complex and more predictable the system is (Leonardi, 2018), indicating 
the presence of fewer patterns (Fusaroli & Tyl´en, 2016). Consequently, a 
lower entropy of amplitudes indicates a more predictable system with 
fewer stress patterns, that is, stressing words in the same manner 
throughout the signal. 
The fifth measure, laminarity, indicates the degree to which a signal is 
‘trapped’ into repeating the same patterns over time (Cox et al., 2016; 
see also Fig. 3). Put it differently, laminarity quantifies the amount of 
smoothness (Konvalinka et al., 2011). Similar to determinism, lami­
narity is estimated by dividing the recurrence points of the vertical lines 
by the total number of recurrence points in the recurrence plot (Marwan 
et al., 2007). High laminarity indicates a smoother system that remains 
unchanged or changes slowly. The fewer vertical structures compared to 
single recurrence points, the lower the laminarity (Brick et al., 2018; 
Marwan et al., 2007). Accordingly, a high laminarity of amplitudes in­
dicates that reader's stressing pattern changes at a slower rate. For 
example, this could be the case if readers stumble over words 
throughout the signal and stress the same letter several times in 
succession. 
The sixth measure, maximal vertical line length, refers to the length of 
the longest horizontal and vertical line in the recurrence plot (Marwan 
et al., 2007). This line informs us about the maximal length of repeti­
tions that are due to slow changing or identical consecutive occurrences 
(Leonardi, 2018). Therefore, the maximal vertical line length of ampli­
tudes indicates the duration of the longest repetition of stresses in a row. 
The seventh measure, trend, refers to the slope of the regression line 
of the amount of recurrence as a function of their distance from the main 
diagonal line (Marwan & Webber, 2015). Trend is an index of the degree 
of stationarity of the signal, with values near 0 indicating stationarity, 
whereas values far from 0 indicate a nonstationary process (Marwan & 
Webber, 2015). Hence, in relation to amplitudes a trend nearing zero 
indicates that the signal's stresses remain stationary over time, that is, 
they do not change over time. 
Finally, recurrence intervals refer to the average time for the system to 
revisit a successive point in the signal (see Fig. 3). In other words, they 
reflect the average duration between recurrences and indicate the ex­
pected frequency of recurrences. Recurrence intervals are estimated by 
dividing the entire signal time by the total number of a recurrences. The 
shorter the recurrence interval, the more frequently a recurrence is 
likely to occur. Thus, a higher recurrence interval of amplitudes in­
dicates a longer duration between recurring stresses. 
3.1.2. Repeated k-fold cross-validation 
Given the large number of variables obtained through RQA, we 
proceeded with a 100× repeated 5-fold cross-validation separately for 
each grade to train a LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection 
Operator) logistic regression model and identify the most important 
predictors for children's classification as skilled and struggling readers. 
To this end, we used the R caret package (Kuhn, 2008, 2020). In k-fold 
cross-validation, the data are partitioned in k subsets (folds), with k-1 
folds used for the model construction and the one remaining fold used 
for the model validation (de Rooij & Weeda, 2020). In this study, the 
data were partitioned into five folds of approximately equal size. Four 
folds were randomly used to train the models and the one remaining fold 
was used to validate the final models. The exact same procedure was also 
used for the variables obtained through GAT. 
Children's status as tutees or tutors (dummy-coded; 0 = tutee; 1 =
tutor) was used as the outcome variable. All variables were z-stan­
dardized and entered as predictors in the models. The estimated pa­
rameters for each class were saved at the end of each calculation. These 
parameters were then used on the test data to obtain the prediction 
errors and the area under the curve. To increase the accuracy of the 
estimation and assess how many times a particular model had a smaller 
prediction error than the other models, this procedure was repeated 100 
times. The built-in evaluation function of the caret package (Kuhn, 
2008, 2020) was used to generate a list with the predictors ranked ac­
cording to their contribution to the model (see Figs. S1–S4 in online 
supplement for the overall importance). 
3.2. Important variables for distinguishing between tutees and tutors in 
grade 2 
For the data of Grade 2, the 100× repeated 5-fold cross-validation 
showed that the model with the RQA variables had a larger area 
under the curve, a lower root mean square error, and a higher R2 in the 
comparison of the two models (see Table 1). For the model with the RQA 
variables, the average reading rate per second (B = 0.96, OR = 2.61), the 
recurrence interval between pauses (B = −0.49, OR = 0.61), the 
maximal diagonal line length of amplitudes (B = −0.17, OR = 0.84), and 
the maximal vertical line length of pauses (B = −0.01, OR = 0.99) were 
the most important predictors for children's classification into tutees and 
tutors in Grade 2. For the model with the GAT variables, the inappro­
priate pauses within and between words of a phrase (B = −0.75, OR =
0.47) and the number of occurrences for lengthening (B = −0.02, OR =
0.98) were the most important predictors for children's classification 
into tutees and tutors in Grade 2. 
3.3. Important variables for distinguishing between tutees and tutors in 
Grade 4 
For the data of Grade 4, the 100× repeated 5-fold cross-validation 
showed that the model with the RQA variables had a lower area under 
the curve, but also a lower root mean square error, and a higher R2 in the 
comparison of the two models (see Table 1). For the model with the RQA 
variables, a total of 20 predictors were found to be important for chil­
dren's classification into tutees and tutors in Grade 4 (see Table 2 for the 
complete list of the predictors). The five most important predictors were 
the laminarity of pauses (B = 3.65, OR = 38.44), the average diagonal 
line of pauses (B = 3.23, OR = 25.22), the determinism of pitch (B =
−2.77, OR = 0.06), the trend of recurrences in amplitudes (B = −2.17, 
OR = 0.11) and the maximal vertical line of pauses (B = −2.01, OR =
0.13). For the model with the GAT variables, the inappropriate pauses 
within and between words of a phrase (B = −1.11, OR = 0.33) and the 
number of occurrences for lengthening (B = −0.12, OR = 0.89) were the 
most important predictors for children's classification into tutees and 
tutors in Grade 4. 
For each child in each model, logits were estimated and then trans­
formed into probabilities. Estimated probabilities are presented as per­
centages. Classified struggling readers (tutees) from both models are 
shown in the bottom-left quadrant, whereas classified skilled readers 
(tutors) from both models are shown in the top-right quadrant. 
4. Discussion 
The primary goals of this study were to identify prosodic patterns in 
oral reading that differentiate struggling and skilled German readers 
using RQA measures, which have been successfully used to predict 
comprehension scores from reading time measures (Wallot et al., 2014), 
and to compare the discrimination of these patterns with prosodic fea­
tures obtained using the transcription method GAT. For this purpose, 
oral readings of a passage by German second and fourth graders were 
recorded and analysed. 
The results for Grade 2 revealed that the model estimated with the 
RQA measures had a better fit than the model estimated with the GAT 
measures. The average reading rate per second, the recurrence interval 
between pauses, the maximal diagonal line of amplitudes, and the 
maximal vertical line of pauses were the most important predictors of 
the model with the RQA variables.

The importance of the average reading rate in distinguishing be­
tween struggling and skilled readers should not be surprising consid­
ering that skilled readers have been shown to have a faster reading rate 
than struggling readers, reflecting more fluent reading (e.g., Schwa­
nenflugel et al., 2004). Furthermore, one possible explanation for the 
longer intervals between recurring pauses could be that struggling 
readers stumble when reading a word or sentence, resulting in longer 
reading durations between pauses. This explanation, however, fails to 
account for the total number of pauses. According to the results of GAT, 
struggling readers still made 19 inappropriate pauses on average, 
compared to 5.71 inappropriate pauses on average for skilled readers. 
The third important variable, the maximal diagonal line, indicates that 
struggling readers have a more stable and periodic system regarding 
amplitudes than skilled readers. Struggling readers appear to have 
longer repetitions of amplitudes than skilled readers, which is consistent 
with prior research that revealed that skilled readers insert a stress less 
frequently than struggling readers (Clay & Imlach, 1971; Dowhower, 
1991). According to Clay and Imlach (1971), good readers read in 
syntactic chunks, whereas poor readers read the text as if it was a list of 
words. Hence, it seems plausible that inserting a stress can result from 
inefficient word recognition. Readers who are unable to recognize words 
from memory, according to Torgesen and Hudson (2006), may stumble 
over several words and make numerous errors while trying to “sound 
out” the word before recognizing it and moving on to the next one. 
Finally, the maximal vertical line of pauses shows that struggling readers 
have a longer sequence of consecutive pauses than skilled readers. The 
predictor “pauses” includes intra- and inter-sentential pauses, that is, 
pauses within and between words independent of the syntactic phrases. 
This finding is in line with prior research, which found that skilled 
readers take fewer pauses than struggling readers (e.g., Clay & Imlach, 
1971; Schwanenflugel et al., 2004). 
In Grade 4, the results revealed that again the model estimated with 
the RQA measures had a better fit than the model estimated with the 
GAT measures. A total of 20 variables were found to be important in 
classifying tutees and tutors. However, in this section, we will focus on 
the five most important predictors: laminarity of pauses, average diag­
onal line of pauses, the determinism of pitch, trend of recurrences in 
amplitudes, and maximal vertical line of pauses. 
It appears that pause patterns of skilled readers change at a slower 
pace than those of struggling readers, indicating a higher degree of 
repeating pause patterns. Additionally, our results suggest that skilled 
readers show on average more repetitions of a pause pattern than 
struggling readers. However, these findings do not imply that skilled 
readers took more or longer pauses than struggling readers. It simply 
shows that the pause patterns of skilled readers were more stable over 
time than the pause patterns of struggling readers. Furthermore, deter­
minism of pitch suggests that struggling readers exhibit more pitch 
repetitions than skilled readers. One possible explanation for the higher 
pitch repetitiveness could be that struggling readers read words or a 
whole phrase with the same pitch, compared to skilled readers, who 
have been shown to have a larger pitch range and more appropriate 
pitch falls and rises than struggling readers (e.g., English: Benjamin 
et al., 2013; Spanish: ´Alvarez-Ca˜nizo et al., 2015). In addition, when 
compared to skilled readers, struggling readers showed similar ampli­
tude patterns over time. This finding is consistent with previous studies 
which showed that struggling readers insert a stress in each word, 
whereas skilled readers insert a stress less frequently (Clay & Imlach, 
1971). Hence, amplitudes of struggling readers are distributed more 
homogenously over time than the amplitudes of skilled readers. Finally, 
the maximal vertical line of pauses shows that struggling readers have a 
longer sequence of consecutive pauses than skilled readers. This result is 
also in accordance with previous studies, which showed that skilled 
readers make fewer pauses compared to struggling readers (e.g., Clay & 
Imlach, 1971; Schwanenflugel et al., 2004). 
According to the results of the prosodic features obtained with cod­
ing schema GAT, the sum of inappropriate pauses and occurrences of 
lengthening were the most important predictors in distinguishing be­
tween skilled and struggling readers in Grades 2 and 4. Struggling 
readers made hesitant pauses within words or in the middle of a phrase. 
Skilled readers making fewer and shorter ungrammatical pauses than 
struggling readers is also consistent with prior studies (´Alvarez-Ca˜nizo 
et al., 2015; Godde et al., 2020; Schwanenflugel et al., 2004). Inappro­
priate pauses appear to be the result of decoding issues or the misreading 
of a sentence's syntax (Godde et al., 2020; Miller & Schwanenflugel, 
2008) and have been shown to negatively relate to other aspects of 
reading fluency and reading comprehension (Benjamin & Schwanen­
flugel, 2010; Dowhower, 1991). Furthermore, struggling readers in the 
current study prolonged syllables within words, which lead to inap­
propriate word pronunciation. This finding is in line with Lyytinen et al. 
(1995), who showed that lengthening occurrences within words in 
struggling Finnish readers occurs more frequently than in skilled 
readers. One possible explanation for this improper use of vowel dura­
tion marking could be that children have difficulty distinguishing be­
tween long and short vowel phonemes (Landerl & Reitsma, 2005).

In accordance with our expectations, when models with RQA pre­
dictors were compared to models with GAT predictors, models with RQA 
predictors had a higher area under the curve (except for the area under 
the curve in Grade 4), a smaller root mean square error, and a higher R2 
of the two models than the GAT models. The models estimated using 
prosodic patterns performed better than models estimated with prosodic 
features. However, as can be seen in the upper left and lower right 
quadrants of Figs. 4 and 5, the children misclassified by the two methods 
were usually not the same. This misclassification might be caused by 
children demonstrating a behavior pattern in the variables of interest 
that differs from their respective group. For example, by looking at the 
incorrect pauses of second grade tutors who were misclassified as tutees 
using the GAT model and the incorrect pauses of correctly classified 
second grade tutors, we noticed that misclassified tutors made 11.80 
incorrect pauses on average, whereas correctly classified tutors made 
only 4.15 incorrect pauses on average. Nevertheless, it appears that 
despite tapping into distinct processes, both methods can distinguish 
between skilled and struggling readers, with complex prosodic patterns 
obtained with RQA faring better than prosodic features obtained with 
GAT. 
In sum, our findings indicate that German skilled readers in Grade 2 
have a faster reading rate, shorter intervals between pauses, and less 
repetitions of recurrent amplitudes and pauses, whereas German skilled 
readers in Grade 4 had more stable pause patterns over time, less pitch 
repetitions, less similar amplitude patterns over time, and less repeti­
tions of pauses in a row. Furthermore, the RQA models outperformed the 
GAT models in the classification of skilled and struggling readers. 
4.1. Limitations 
Given the scarcity of RQA for prosody data, our findings are 
encouraging. They must, however, be interpreted with some limitations 
in mind. First, because of the large number of variables, we needed to 
conduct a 100 × 5-fold cross-validation to deal with the RQA's curse of 
dimensionality. We reduced this number by employing a LASSO logistic 
regression to identify the most important predictors influencing model 
performance with a feature selection algorithm. Nonetheless, despite the 
exploratory nature of our analyses, this procedure may alleviate some 
concerns regarding overfitting. Therefore, we made every effort to 
document and disclose every stage of our analyses so that they may be 
utilized as a reference for future studies. 
Another limitation of our study is that even though children were 
separated into tutees and tutors at the start of the study based on their 
pre-test reading comprehension scores, they had already participated in 
23 training sessions by the time of the oral reading. Therefore, 
notwithstanding the disparities in reading comprehension between the 
two groups at the post-test, we cannot be certain that the results would 
have been the same if the children had not participated in the training.

In addition, half of the children received a reading fluency training 
whereas the other half received a training of visuospatial working 
memory. However, investigating prosodic patterns separately for each 
training would require a larger sample. Sample sizes in this study were 
relatively small, which might have also impacted the parameter esti­
mates and lead to a relatively low power. 
4.2. Conclusion 
Despite these limitations, the study demonstrates that using RQA for 
prosody analysis is a promising approach. If similar results were to be 
obtained in a longitudinal design identifying prosodic patterns that 
distinguish between struggling and skilled readers throughout primary 
school, RQA might prove to be a versatile tool in research on prosody. 
Confirming our findings would provide experts with another option for a 
precise semi-automatic assessment of prosodic difficulties, which is far 
more economic than hand-coding prosodic features with GAT. Finally, 
the RQA seems to provide additional information about prosody that 
augments established approaches, which might be useful for advancing 
the existing theories.

Fig. 5. Scatter plot of the estimated proba­
bilities from the model with prosodic features 
versus the estimated probabilities for the 
model with prosodic patterns in Grade 4. For 
each child in each model, logits were esti­
mated and then transformed into probabili­
ties. Estimated probabilities are presented as 
percentages. Classified struggling readers (tu­
tees) from both models are shown in the 
bottom-left quadrant, whereas classified skil­
led readers (tutors) from both models are 
shown in the top-right quadrant.
