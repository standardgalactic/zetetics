Preface
This curriculum was originally developed for a fourth-year undergraduate optics
course in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University.
Topics are addressed from a physics perspective and include the propagation of
light in matter, reﬂection and transmission at boundaries, polarization effects,
dispersion, coherence, ray optics and imaging, diffraction, and the quantum
nature of light. Students using this book should be familiar with differentiation,
integration, and standard trigonometric and algebraic manipulation. A brief
review of complex numbers, vector calculus, and Fourier transforms is provided
in Chapter 0, but it is helpful if students already have some experience with these
concepts.
While the authors retain the copyright, we have made this book available free
of charge at optics.byu.edu. This is our contribution toward a future world with
free textbooks! The web site also provides a link to purchase bound copies of the
book for the cost of printing. A collection of electronic material related to the
text is available at the same site, including videos of students performing the lab
assignments found in the book.
The development of optics has a rich history. We have included historical
sketches for a selection of the pioneers in the ﬁeld to help students appreciate
some of this historical context. These sketches are not intended to be author-
itative; the information for most individuals has been gleaned primarily from
Wikipedia.
The authors may be contacted at opticsbook@byu.edu. We enjoy hearing
reports from those using the book and welcome constructive feedback. We occa-
sionally revise the text. The title page indicates the date of the last revision.
We would like to thank all those who have helped improve this material. We
especially thank John Colton, Bret Hess, and Harold Stokes for their careful review
and extensive suggestions. This curriculum beneﬁtted from a CCLI grant from
the National Science Foundation Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE-
9952773).

Chapter 0
Mathematical Tools
Before moving on to chapter 1 where our study of optics begins, it would be good
to look over this chapter to make sure you are comfortable with the mathematical
tools we’ll be using. The vector calculus information in section 0.1 is used straight
away in Chapter 1, so you should review it now. In Section 0.2 we review complex
numbers. You have probably had some exposure to complex numbers, but if you
are like many students, you haven’t yet fully appreciated their usefulness. Your
life will be much easier if you understand the material in section 0.2 by heart.
Complex notation is pervasive throughout the book, beginning in chapter 2.
You may safely procrastinate reviewing Sections 0.3 and 0.4 until they come
up in the book. The linear algebra refresher in Section 0.3 is useful for Chapter 4,
where we analyze multilayer coatings, and again in Chapter 6, where we discuss
polarization. Section 0.4 provides an introduction to Fourier theory. Fourier trans-
forms are used extensively in optics, and you should study Section 0.4 carefully
before tackling Chapter 7.
0.1
Vector Calculus
René Descartes (1596-1650, French)
was born in in La Haye en Touraine
(now Descartes), France. His mother
died when he was an infant. His father
was a member of parliament who en-
couraged Descartes to become a lawyer.
Descartes graduated with a degree in
law from the University of Poitiers
in 1616. In 1619, he had a series of
dreams that led him to believe that he
should instead pursue science. Descartes
became one of the greatest mathemati-
cians, physicists, and philosophers of
all time. He is credited with inventing
the cartesian coordinate system, which
is named after him. For the rst time,
geometric shapes could be expressed as
algebraic equations. (Wikipedia)
Each position in space corresponds to a unique vector r ≡xˆx + y ˆy + zˆz, where
ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz are unit vectors with length one, pointing along their respective axes.
Boldface type distinguishes a variable as a vector quantity, and the use of ˆx, ˆy,
and ˆz denotes a Cartesian coordinate system. Electric and magnetic ﬁelds are
vectors whose magnitude and direction can depend on position, as denoted by
E(r) or B(r). An example of such a ﬁeld is E(r) = q (r−r0)
±
4πϵ0 |r−r0|3 , which
is the static electric ﬁeld surrounding a point charge located at position r0. The
absolute-value brackets indicate the magnitude (or length) of the vector given by
|r−r0| =
¯¯(x −x0) ˆx+
¡

Figure 0.1 The electric ﬁeld vec-
tors around a point charge.
Solution: As mentioned above, the ﬁeld is given by E(r) = q (r−r0)
±
4πϵ0 |r−r0|3 .
We have
r−r0 =
¡
(2−1)ˆx+(2−1)ˆy+(2−2)ˆz

Å =

In addition to position, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds almost always depend
on time in optics problems. For example, a common time-dependent ﬁeld is
E(r,t) = E0 cos(k·r−ωt). The dot product k·r is an example of vector multiplication,
and signiﬁes the following operation:
k·r =
¡
kx ˆx+ky ˆy+kzˆz
¢
·
¡
xˆx+ y ˆy+ zˆz
¢
= kxx +ky y +kzz
= |k||r|cosφ
(0.2)
where φ is the angle between the vectors k and r.
Proof of the ﬁnal line of (0.2)
Consider the plane that contains the two vectors k and r. Call it the x′y′-plane. In
this coordinate system, the two vectors can be written as k = k cosθˆx′+k sinθˆy′ and
r = r cosαˆx′+r sinαˆy′, where θ and α are the respective angles that the two vectors
make with the x′-axis. The dot product gives k · r = kr (cosθcosα+sinθsinα).
This simpliﬁes to k·r = kr cosφ (see (0.13)), where φ ≡θ −α is the angle between
the vectors. Thus, the dot product between two vectors is the product of the
magnitudes of each vector times the cosine of the angle between them.
Another type of vector multiplication is the cross product, which is accom-
plished in the following manner:1
E×B =
¯¯¯¯¯¯

¡

¢

(0.3)
1The use of the determinant to generate the cross product is merely a convenient device for
remembering its form.

0.1 Vector Calculus

Note that the cross product results in a vector, whereas the dot product mentioned
above results in a scalar (i.e. a number with appropriate units). The resultant
cross-product vector is always perpendicular to the two vectors that are cross
multiplied. If the ﬁngers on your right hand curl from the ﬁrst vector towards the
second, your thumb will point in the direction of the result. The magnitude of the
result equals the product of the magnitudes of the constituent vectors times the
sine of the angle between them.
Proof of cross-product properties
We label the plane containing E and B the x′y′-plane. In this coordinate system, the
two vectors can be written as E = E cosθˆx′ +E sinθˆy′ and B = B cosαˆx′ +B sinαˆy′,
where θ and α are the respective angles that the two vectors make with the x′-axis.
The cross product, according to (0.3), gives E×B = EB(cosθsinα−sinθcosα)ˆz′.
This simpliﬁes to E×B = EB sinφˆz′ (see (0.14)), where φ ≡α−θ is the angle be-
tween the vectors. The vectors E and B, which both lie in the x′y′-plane, are both
perpendicular to z′. If 0 < θ −α < π, the result E × B points in the positive z′
direction, which is consistent with the right-hand rule.
Figure 0.2 Right-hand rule for
cross product.
We will use several multidimensional derivatives in our study of optics, namely
the gradient, the divergence, and the curl.2 In Cartesian coordinates, the gradient
of a scalar function is given by
∇f
¡
x, y,z
¢
= ∂f
∂x ˆx+ ∂f
∂y ˆy+ ∂f
∂z ˆz
(0.4)
the divergence, which applies to vector functions, is given by
∇·E = ∂Ex
∂x +
∂Ey
∂y + ∂Ez
∂z
(0.5)
and the curl, which also applies to vector functions, is given by

Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827,
French) was born in Normandy, France
to a farm laborer. Some wealthy neigh-
bors noticed his unusual abilities and
took an interest in his education.
Laplace is sometimes revered as the
Newton of France with contributions
to mathematics and astronomy. The
Laplacian dierential operator as well as
Laplace transforms are used widely in
applied mathematics. (Wikipedia)
We will sometimes need a multidimensional second derivative called the
Laplacian. When applied to a scalar function, it is deﬁned as the divergence of a
gradient:

The Laplacian applied to a scalar gives a result that is also a scalar. In Cartesian
coordinates, we deal with vector functions by applying the Laplacian to the scalar
function attached to each unit vector:

This is possible because each unit vector is a constant in Cartesian coordinates.
The various multidimensional derivatives take on more complicated forms
in non-cartesian coordinates such as cylindrical or spherical. You can derive the
Laplacian for these other coordinate systems by changing variables and rewriting
the unit vectors starting from the above Cartesian expression. (See Problem 0.10.)
Regardless of the coordinate system, the Laplacian for a vector function can be
obtained from ﬁrst derivatives though

The integration on the left-hand side is over the closed surface S, which contains
the volume V associated with the integration on the right-hand side. The unit
vector ˆn points outward, normal to the surface. The divergence theorem is espe-
cially useful in connection with Gauss’ law, where the left-hand side is interpreted
as the number of ﬁeld lines exiting a closed surface.

The integration on the left-hand side is over an open surface S (not enclosing a
volume). The integration on the right-hand side is around the edge of the surface.
Again, ˆn is a unit vector that always points normal to the surface . The vector dℓ
points along the curve C that bounds the surface S. If the ﬁngers of your right
hand point in the direction of integration around C, then your thumb points
in the direction of ˆn. Stokes’ theorem is especially useful in connection with
Ampere’s law and Faraday’s law. The right-hand side is an integration of a ﬁeld
around a loop.

With a basic familiarity with trigonometry, we can approach many optical
problems including those involving the addition of multiple waves. However, the
manipulation of trigonometric functions via identities such as (0.13) and (0.14)
can be cumbersome and tedious. Fortunately, complex-number notation offers
an equivalent approach with far less busy work. The modest investment needed to
become comfortable with complex notation is deﬁnitely worth it; optics problems
can become cumbersome enough even with the most efﬁcient methods!
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783, Swiss)
was born in Basel, Switzerland. His
father, Paul Euler, was friends with
the well-known mathematician Johann
Bernoulli, who discovered young Euler's
great talent for mathematics and tu-
tored him regularly. Euler enrolled at
the University of Basel at age thirteen.
In 1726 Euler accepted an oer to join
the Russian Academy of Sciences in
St Petersburg, having unsuccessfully
applied for a professorship at the Uni-
versity of Basel. Under the auspices of
the Czars (with the exception of 12-year-
old Peter II), foreign academicians in
the Russian Academy were given con-
siderable freedom to pursue scientic
questions with relatively light teaching
duties. Euler spent his early career in
Russia, his mid career in Berlin, and
his later career again in Russia. Euler
introduced the concept of a function.
He successfully dened logarithms and
exponential functions for complex num-
bers and discovered the connection to
trigonometric functions. The special
case of Euler's formula eiπ + 1 = 0 has
been voted by modern fans of math-
ematics (including Richard Feynman)
as the Most Beautiful Mathematical
Formula Ever for its single uses of
addition, multiplication, exponentia-
tion, equality, and the constants 0, 1,
e, i and π. Euler and his wife, Katha-
rina Gsell, were the parents of 13 chil-
dren, many of whom died in childhood.
(Wikipedia)
The convenience of complex-number notation has its origins in Euler’s for-
mula:
eiφ = cosφ+i sinφ
(0.15)
where i ≡
p
−1 is an imaginary number. By inverting Euler’s formula (0.15) (and
its twin with φ →−φ) we can obtain the following representation of the cosine
and sine functions:
cosφ = eiφ +e−iφ
2
,
sinφ = eiφ −e−iφ
2i
(0.16)
Equation (0.16) shows how ordinary sines and cosines are intimately related to
hyperbolic cosines and hyperbolic sines. If φ happens to be imaginary such that
φ = iγ where γ is real, then we have
siniγ = e−γ −eγ
2i
= i sinhγ
cosiγ = e−γ +eγ
2
= coshγ
(0.17)
Proof of Euler’s formula
We can prove Euler’s formula using a Taylor’s series expansion:
f (x) = f (x0)+ 1

The last line of (0.19) is seen to be the sum of the ﬁrst two lines, from which Euler’s
formula directly follows.
Brook Taylor (1685-1731, English) was
born in Middlesex, England. He studied
at Cambridge as a fellow-commoner
earning a bachelor degree in 1709
and a doctoral degree in 1714. Soon
thereafter, he developed the branch
of mathematics known as calculus of
nite dierences. He used it to study
the movement of vibrating strings. As
part of that work, he developed the for-
mula known today as Taylor's theorem,
which was under-appreciated until 1772,
when French mathematician Lagrange
referred to it as the main foundation of
dierential calculus. (Wikipedia)
Example 0.4
Prove (0.13) and (0.14) as well as cos2 φ+sin2 φ = 1 by taking advantage of (0.16).
Solution: We start with Euler’s formula (0.15) for a sum of angles:
cos(α+β)+i sin(α+β) = ei(α+β)
= eiαeiβ
= (cosα+i sinα)(cosβ+i sinβ)
= (cosαcosβ−sinαsinβ)+i(sinαcosβ+cosαsinβ)
Equating the real parts gives (0.13), and equating the imaginary parts gives (0.14).
In the case of β = −α, we have 1 = cos2 α+sin2 α.
Or,
We start with (0.13). By direct application of (0.16) and some rearranging, we have
cosαcosβ−sinαsinβ = eiα +e−iα

We can prove (0.14) using the same technique:

2i

writing

¢

n
˜Aeiαo
(0.20)
where the ‘phase’ β is conveniently contained within the complex factor ˜A ≡Aeiβ.
The operation Re{ } means to retain only the real part of the argument without
regard for the imaginary part. As an example, we have Re{1+2i} = 1. The formula
(0.20) follows directly from Euler’s equation (0.15).
It is common (even conventional) to omit the explicit writing of Re{ }. Thus,
physicists participate in a conspiracy that ˜Aeiα actually means Acos

Gerolamo Cardano (1501-1576, Italian)
was the rst to introduce the notion
of complex numbers (which he called
ctitious) while developing solutions
to cubic and quartic equations. He was
born in Pavia, Italy, the illegitimate son
of a lawyer who was an acquaintance
of Leonardo da Vinci. Cardano was for-
tunate to survive infancy as his father
claimed that his mother attempted to
abort him and his older siblings all died
of the plague. Cardano studied at the
University of Pavia and later at Padua.
He was known for being eccentric and
confrontational, which did not earn him
many friends. He supported himself
in part as a somewhat successful gam-
bler, but he was often short of money.
Cardano also introduced binomial co-
ecients and the binomial theorem.
(Wikipedia)
As an example, note that Re{1+2i} + Re{3+4i} = Re{(1+2i)+(3+4i)} = 4.
However, we must be careful when performing other operations such as multi-
plication. In this case, it is essential to take the real parts before performing the
operation. Notice that

As an example, we see Re{1+2i}×Re{3+4i} = 3, but Re{(1+2i)(3+4i)} = −5.
When dealing with complex numbers it is often advantageous to transform
between a Cartesian representation and a polar representation. With the aid of
Euler’s formula, it is possible to transform any complex number a +ib into the
form ρeiφ, where a, b, ρ, and φ are real. From (0.15), the required connection
between
¡
ρ,φ
¢
and (a,b) is
ρeiφ = ρ cosφ+iρ sinφ = a +ib
(0.23)
The real and imaginary parts of this equation must separately be equal. Thus, we
have
a = ρ cosφ
b = ρ sinφ
(0.24)
These equations can be inverted to yield
ρ =
p

φ = tan−1 b

When a < 0, we must adjust φ by π since the arctangent has a range only from
−π/2 to π/2.

Figure 0.5 A number in the com-
plex plane can be represented
either by Cartesian or polar repre-
sentation.
The transformations in (0.24) and (0.25) have a clear geometrical interpreta-
tion in the complex plane, and this makes it easier to remember them. They are
just the usual connections between Cartesian and polar coordinates. As seen in
Fig. 0.5, ρ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle having legs with lengths a and b,
and φ is the angle that the hypotenuse makes with the x-axis. Again, you should
be careful when a is negative since the arctangent is deﬁned in quadrants I and
IV. An easy way to deal with the situation of a negative a is to factor the minus
sign out before proceeding (i.e. a +ib = −(−a −ib) ). Then the transformation
is made on −a −ib where −a is positive. The overall minus sign out in front is
just carried along unaffected and can be factored back in at the end. Notice that
−ρeiφ is the same as ρei(φ±π).
Example 0.5
Write −3+4i in polar format.
Figure 0.6 Geometric representa-
tion of −3+4i
Solution: We must be careful with the negative real part since it indicates a quad-
rant (in this case II) outside of the domain of the inverse tangent (quadrants I and
IV). Best to factor the negative out and deal with it separately.
−3+4i = −(3−4i) = −

Finally, we consider the concept of a complex conjugate. The conjugate of a
complex number z = a +ib is denoted with an asterisk and amounts to changing
the sign on the imaginary part of the number:
z∗= (a +ib)∗≡a −ib
(0.26)
The complex conjugate is useful when computing the absolute value of a complex
number:
|z| =
p
z∗z =
p
(a −ib)(a +ib) =
p
a2 +b2 = ρ
(0.27)
Note that the absolute value of a complex number is the same as its magnitude ρ
as deﬁned in (0.25). The complex conjugate is also useful for eliminating complex
numbers from the denominator of expressions:
a +ib
c +id = (a +ib)
(c +id)
(c −id)
(c −id) = ac +bd +i (bc −ad)
c2 +d2
(0.28)
No matter how complicated an expression, the complex conjugate is calcu-
lated by inserting a minus sign in front of all occurrences of i in the expression,
and placing an asterisk on all complex variables in the expression. For example,
the complex conjugate of ρeiφ is ρe−iφ assuming ρ and φ are real, as can be seen
from Euler’s formula (0.15). As another example consider

assuming z, ω, and t are real, but E0 and k are complex.
A common way of obtaining the real part of an expression is by adding the
complex conjugate and dividing the result by 2:
Re{z} = 1
2
¡
z + z∗¢
(0.30)
Notice that the expression for cosφ in (0.16) is an example of this formula. Some-
times when a lengthy expression is added to its own complex conjugate, we let
“C.C.” represent the complex conjugate in order to avoid writing the expression
twice.
In optics we sometimes encounter a complex angle, , such as kz in (0.29). The
imaginary part of K governs exponential decay (or growth) when a light wave
propagates in an absorptive (or amplifying) medium. Similarly, when we compute
the transmission angle for light incident upon a surface beyond the critical angle
for total internal reﬂection, we encounter the arcsine of a number greater than
one in an effort to satisfy Snell’s law. Even though such an angle does not exist in
the physical sense, a complex value for the angle can be found, which satisﬁes
(0.16) and describes evanescent waves.

Linear Algebra
Throughout this book we will often encounter sets of linear equations. (They
are called linear equations because they represent lines in a plane or in space.)
Most often, there are just two equations with two variables to solve. The simplest
example of such a set of equations is
Ax +B y = F
and
Cx+Dy = G
(0.31)
where x and y are variables. A set of linear equations such as (0.31) can be
expressed using matrix notation as

As seen above, the 2 × 2 matrix multiplied onto the two-dimensional column
vector results in a two-dimensional vector. The elements of rows are multiplied
onto elements of the column and summed to create each new element in the
result. A matrix can also be multiplied onto another matrix (rows multiplying
columns, resulting in a matrix). The order of multiplication is important; matrix
multiplication is not commutative.
To solve a matrix equation such as (0.32), we multiply both sides by an inverse
matrix, which gives

James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897,
English) made fundamental contribu-
tions to matrix theory, invariant theory,
number theory, partition theory and
combinatorics. He played a leadership
role in American mathematics in the
later half of the 19th century as a pro-
fessor at the Johns Hopkins University
and as founder of the American Journal
of Mathematics. (Wikipedia)
The above review of linear algebra is very basic. In contrast, we next dis-
cuss Sylvester’s theorem, which you probably have not previously encountered.
Sylvester’s theorem is useful when multiplying the same 2×2 matrix (with a de-
terminate of unity) together many times (i.e. raising the matrix to a power). This
situation occurs when modeling periodic multilayer mirror coatings or when
considering light rays trapped in a laser cavity as they reﬂect many times.

Fourier Theory
In the study of optics, it is common to decompose complicated light ﬁelds into
superpositions of pure sinusoidal waves. This is called Fourier analysis.5 This is
important since individual sine waves tend to move differently through optical
systems (say, a piece of glass with frequency-dependent index). After propagation
5See Murray R. Spiegel, Schaum’s Outline of Advanced Mathematics for Engineers and Scientists,
Chaps. 7-8 (New York: McGraw-Hill 1971).

Chapter 0 Mathematical Tools
through a system, we can also reassemble sinusoidal waves to see the effect on the
overall waveform. In fact, it will be possible to work simultaneously with inﬁnitely
many sinusoidal waves, where the frequencies comprising a light ﬁeld are spread
continuously over a range. Fourier transforms are also helpful for diffraction
problems where many waves (all with the same frequency) interfere spatially.
We begin with a derivation of the Fourier integral theorem. As asserted by
Fourier, a periodic function can be represented in terms of sines and cosines in
the following manner:
f (t) =
∞
X
n=0
an cos(n∆ωt)+bn sin(n∆ωt)
(0.40)
This is called a Fourier expansion. It is similar in idea to a Taylor’s series (0.18),
which rewrites a function as a polynomial. In both cases, the goal is to represent
one function in terms of a linear combination of other functions (requiring a
complete basis set). In a Taylor’s series the basis functions are polynomials and
in a Fourier expansion the basis functions are sines and cosines with various
frequencies (multiples of a fundamental frequency).
Joseph Fourier (1768-1830, French)
was born to a tailor in Auxerre, France.
He was orphaned at age eight. Because
of his humble background, which closed
some doors to his education and career,
he became a prominent supporter of the
French Revolution. He was rewarded
by an appointment to a position in the
École Polytechnique. In 1798, partici-
pated in Napoleon's expedition to Egypt
and served as governor over lower Egypt
for a time. Fourier made signicant con-
tributions to the study of heat transfer
and vibrations (presented in 1822), and
it was in this context that he asserted
that functions could be represented as a
series of sine waves. (Wikipedia)
By inspection, we see that all terms in (0.40) repeat with a maximum period
of 2π/∆ω. In other words, a Fourier series is good for functions where f (t) =
f (t +2π/∆ω). The expansion (0.40) is useful even if f (t) is complex, requiring an
and bn to be complex.
Using (0.16), we can rewrite the sines and cosines in the expansion (0.40) as
f (t) =

n=0

(0.42)
where
cn<0 ≡a−n −ib−n
2
cn>0 ≡an +ibn
2
c0 ≡a0
(0.43)
Notice that if c−n = c∗
n for all n, then f (t) is real (i.e. real an and bn); otherwise
f (t) is complex. The real parts of the cn coefﬁcients are connected with the cosine
terms in (0.40), and the imaginary parts of the cn coefﬁcients are connected with
the sine terms in (0.40).
Given a known function f (t), we can compute the various coefﬁcients cn.
There is a trick for ﬁguring out how to do this. We multiply both sides of (0.42) by

(0.44)
The function sin[(m −n)π]/[(m −n)π] is equal to zero for all n ̸= m, and it is
equal to one when n = m (to see this, use L’Hospital’s rule on the zero-over-zero
situation, or just go back and re perform the above integral for n = m). Thus, only
one term contributes to the summation in (0.44). We now have
cm = ∆ω

(0.45)
from which the coefﬁcients cn can be computed, given a function f (t). (Note that
m is a dummy index so we can change it back to n if we like.)
This completes the circle. If we know the function f (t), we can ﬁnd the
coefﬁcients cn via (0.45), and, if we know the coefﬁcients cn, we can generate the
function f (t) via (0.42). If we are feeling a bit silly, we might combine these into a
single identity:

We start with a function f (t) followed by a lot of computation and obtain the
function back again! (This is not quite as foolish as it ﬁrst appears, as we will
discuss later.)
As mentioned above, Fourier expansions represent functions f (t) that are
periodic over the interval 2π/∆ω. This is disappointing since many optical wave-
forms do not repeat (e.g. a single short laser pulse). Nevertheless, we can represent
a function f (t) that is not periodic if we let the period 2π/∆ω become inﬁnitely
long. In other words, we can accommodate non-periodic functions if we take the
limit as ∆ω goes to zero so that the spacing of terms in the series becomes very
ﬁne. Applying this limit to (0.46) we obtain

At this point, a brief review of the deﬁnition of an integral is helpful to better
understand the next step that we shall administer to (0.47).

This concludes our short review of calculus.
Now, (0.47) has the same form as (0.49) if g (n∆ω) represents everything in
the square brackets of (0.47). The result is the Fourier integral theorem:

The piece in brackets is called the Fourier transform, and the rest of the operation
is called the inverse Fourier transform. The Fourier integral theorem (0.50) is often
written with the following (potentially confusing) notation:

. Note that the functions f (t) and f (ω) are en-
tirely different, even taking on different units (e.g. the latter having extra units of
per frequency). The two functions are distinguished by their arguments, which
also have different units (e.g. time vs. frequency). Nevertheless, it is customary to
use the same letter to denote either function since they form a transform pair.

0.4 Fourier Theory

You should be aware that it is arbitrary which of the expressions in (0.51) is
called the transform and which is called the inverse transform. In other words, the
signs in the exponents of (0.51) may be interchanged (and this convention varies
in published works!). Also, the factor 2π may be placed on either the transform or
the inverse transform, or divided equally between the two as has been done here.
Example 0.6
Compute the Fourier transform of E(t) = E0e−t2/2T 2e−iω0t followed by the inverse
Fourier transform.

which brings us back to where we started.
As was previously mentioned, it would seem rather pointless to perform
a Fourier transform on the function f (t) followed by an inverse Fourier trans-
form, just to end up with f (t) again. Instead, we will typically apply a frequency-
dependent effect on f (ω) before performing the inverse Fourier transform. In
this case, the ﬁnal function will be different from f (t). Keep in mind that f (ω) is
the continuous analog of the discrete coefﬁcients cn (or the an and bn). The real
part of f (ω) indicates the amplitudes of the cosine waves necessary to construct
the function f (t). The imaginary part of f (ω) indicates the amplitudes of the sine
waves necessary to construct the function f (t).
Finally, we comment on the Dirac delta function, 6 which is deﬁned indirectly

The delta function δ

is zero everywhere except at t′ = t where it is inﬁnite
in such a way as to make the integral take on the value of the function f (t). (You
can think of δ

at t′ = t with an area unity.) The integral only pays attention to the value of f

From P0.5, the argument in the integral on the right-hand side is zero except at r = r′. Therefore,
if the volume V does not contain the point r = r′, then the result of both integrals must be zero.
Let us construct a volume between an arbitrary surface S1 containing r = r′and S2, the surface
of a tiny sphere centered on r = r′. Since the point r = r′ is excluded by the tiny sphere, the result
of either integral in the divergence theorem is still zero. However, we have on the tiny sphere

Electromagnetic Phenomena
In 1861, James Maxwell assembled the various known relationships of electricity
and magnetism into a concise1 set of equations:2
∇·E = ρ
ϵ0
(Gauss’ Law)
(1.1)
∇·B = 0
(Gauss’ Law for magnetism)
(1.2)
∇×E = −∂B

(Faraday’s Law)
(1.3)
∇× B
µ0
= ϵ0
∂E
∂t +J
(Ampere’s Law revised by Maxwell)
(1.4)
Here E and B represent electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively. The charge
density ρ describes the charge per volume distributed through space.3 The current
density J describes the motion of charge density (in units of ρ times velocity). The
constant ϵ0 is called the permittivity, and the constant µ0 is called the permeability.
Taken together, these are known as Maxwell’s equations.
After introducing a key revision of Ampere’s law, Maxwell realized that together
these equations comprise a complete self-consistent theory of electromagnetic
phenomena. Moreover, the equations imply the existence of electromagnetic
waves, which travel at the speed of light. Since the speed of light had been
measured before Maxwell’s time, it was immediately apparent (as was already
suspected) that light is a high-frequency manifestation of the same phenomena
that govern the inﬂuence of currents and charges upon each other. Previously,
optics had been considered a topic quite separate from electricity and magnetism.
Once the connection was made, it became clear that Maxwell’s equations form
the theoretical foundations of optics, and this is where we begin our study of light.
1In Maxwell’s original notation, this set of equations was hardly concise, written without the
convenience of modern vector notation or ∇. His formulation wouldn’t ﬁt easily on a T-shirt!

with charge density, which makes an appearance only in this chapter.

This relationship is known as Coulomb’s law. The force is directed along the
vector r−r′, which points from charge q′ to q as seen in Fig. 1.1. The length or
magnitude of this vector is given by
¯¯r−r′¯¯ (i.e. the distance between q′ and q).
The familiar inverse square law can be seen by noting that
¡
r−r′¢±¯¯r−r′¯¯ is a unit
vector. We have written the force in terms of an electric ﬁeld E(r), which is deﬁned
throughout space (regardless of whether a second charge q is actually present).
The permittivity ϵ0 amounts to a proportionality constant.

5Actually, Coulomb’s law applies only to static charge conﬁgurations, and in that sense it is
incomplete since it implies an instantaneous response of the ﬁeld to a reconﬁguration of the
charge. The generalized version of Coulomb’s law, one of Jeﬁmenko’s equations, incorporates
the fact that electromagnetic news travels at the speed of light. See D. J. Grifﬁths, Introduction
to Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., Sect. 10.2.2 (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1999). Ironically, Gauss’ law,
which can be derived from Coulomb’s law, holds perfectly whether the charges remain still or are in
motion.

A derivation of this formula is addressed in problem P0.13. The delta function
allows the integral in (1.8) to be performed, and the relation becomes simply
∇·E(r) = ρ (r)
ϵ0
which is the differential form of Gauss’ law (1.1).
    
  
Figure 1.3 Gauss’ law in integral
form relates the ﬂux of the elec-
tric ﬁeld through a surface to the
charge contained inside that sur-
face.
The (perhaps more familiar) integral form of Gauss’ law can be obtained by
integrating (1.1) over a volume V and applying the divergence theorem (0.11) to
the left-hand side:
I

This form of Gauss’ law shows that the total electric ﬁeld ﬂux extruding through a
closed surface S (i.e. the integral on the left side) is proportional to the net charge
contained within it (i.e. within volume V contained by S).

Carl Friedrich Gauss (17771855, Ger-
man) was born in Braunschweig, Ger-
many to a poor family. Gauss was a
child prodigy, and he made his rst sig-
nicant advances to mathematics as a
teenager. In grade school, he purport-
edly was asked to add all integers from
1 to 100, which he did in seconds to the
astonishment of his teacher. (Presum-
ably, Friedrich immediately realized that
the numbers form fty pairs equal to
101.) Gauss made important advances
in number theory and dierential geome-
try. He developed the law discussed here
as one of Maxwell's equations in 1835,
but it was not published until 1867, af-
ter Gauss' death. Ironically, Maxwell
was already using Gauss' law by that
time. (Wikipedia)
1.2
Gauss’ Law for Magnetic Fields
In order to ‘feel’ a magnetic force, a charge q must be moving at some velocity (call
it v). The magnetic ﬁeld arises itself from charges that are in motion. We consider
the magnetic ﬁeld to arise from a distribution of moving charges described by a
current density J
¡
r′¢
throughout space. The current density has units of charge
times velocity per volume (or equivalently, current per cross sectional area). The
magnetic force law analogous to Coulomb’s law is
F = qv×B
(1.11)
6For a derivation of Gauss’ law from Coulomb’s law that does not rely directly on the Dirac delta
function, see J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics 3rd ed., pp. 27-29 (New York: John Wiley,
1999).

The latter equation is known as the Biot-Savart law. The permeability µ0 dictates
the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld, given the current distribution.
Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774-1862,
French) was born in Paris. He attended
the École Polytechnique where mathe-
matician Gaspard Monge recognized his
academic potential. After graduating,
Biot joined the military and then took
part in an insurrection on the side of
the Royalists. He was captured, and
his career might of have met a tragic
ending there had Monge not success-
fully pleaded for his release from jail.
Biot went on to become a professor
of physics at the College de France.
Among other contributions, Biot partic-
ipated in the rst hot-air balloon ride
with Gay-Lussac and correctly deduced
that meteorites that fell on L'Aigle,
France in 1803 came from space. Later
Biot collaborated with the younger Felix
Savart (1791-1841) on the theory of
magnetism and electrical currents. They
formulated their famous law in 1820.
(Wikipedia)
As with Coulomb’s law, we can apply mathematics to the Biot-Savart law
to obtain another of Maxwell’s equations. Nevertheless, the essential physics
is already inherent in the Biot-Savart law.7 Using the result from P0.4, we can

Since the divergence of a curl is identically zero (see P0.6), we get straight away
the second of Maxwell’s equations (1.2)
∇·B = 0
which is known as Gauss’ law for magnetic ﬁelds. (Two equations down; two to
go.)
The similarity between ∇·B = 0 and ∇·E = ρ/ϵ0, Gauss’ law for electric ﬁelds,
is immediately apparent. In integral form, Gauss’ law for magnetic ﬁelds looks the
same as (1.10), only with zero on the right-hand side. If one were to imagine the
existence of magnetic monopoles (i.e. isolated north or south ‘charges’), then the
right-hand side would not be zero. The law implies that the total magnetic ﬂux
extruding through any closed surface balances, with as many ﬁeld lines pointing
inwards as pointing outwards.

response of the magnetic ﬁeld to a reconﬁguration of the currents. The generalized version of the
Biot-Savart law, another of Jeﬁmenko’s equations, incorporates the fact that electromagnetic news
travels at the speed of light. Ironically, Gauss’ law for magnetic ﬁelds and Maxwell’s version of
Ampere’s law, derived from the Biot-Savart law, hold perfectly whether the currents are steady or
vary in time. The Jeﬁmenko equations, analogs of Coulomb and Biot-Savart, also embody Faraday’s
law, the only of Maxwell’s equations that cannot be derived from the usual forms of Coulomb’s law
and the Biot-Savart law. See D. J. Grifﬁths, Introduction to Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., Sect. 10.2.2

Faraday’s Law
Michael Faraday (17911867, English)
was one of the greatest experimental
physicists in history. Born on the out-
skirts of London, his family was not well
o, his father being a blacksmith. The
young Michael Faraday only had access
to a very basic education, and so he
was mostly self taught and never did
acquire much skill in mathematics. As
a teenager, he obtained a seven-year
apprenticeship with a book binder, dur-
ing which time he read many books,
including books on science and electric-
ity. Given his background, Faraday's
entry into the scientic community was
very gradual, from servant to assistant
and eventually to director of the labo-
ratory at the Royal Institution. Faraday
is perhaps best known for his work that
established the law of induction and
for the discovery that magnetic elds
can interact with light, known as the
Faraday eect. He also made many ad-
vances to chemistry during his career
including guring out how to liquify
several gases. Faraday was a deeply re-
ligious man, serving as a Deacon in his
church. (Wikipedia)
Michael Faraday discovered that changing magnetic ﬁelds induce electric ﬁelds.
This distinct physical effect, called induction, can be observed when a magnet is
waved by a loop of wire. Faraday’s law says that a change in magnetic ﬂux through
a circuit loop (see Fig. 1.4) induces a voltage around the loop according to

down; one to go).

André-Marie Ampère (1775-1836,
French) was born in Lyon, France. The
young André-Marie was tutored in Latin
by his father, which gave him access to
the mathematical works of Euler and
Bernoulli to which he was drawn at
an early age. When Ampère reached
young adulthood, French revolutionaries
executed his father. In 1799, Ampère
married Julie Carron, who died of ill-
ness a few years later. These tragedies
weighed heavy on Ampère through-
out his life, especially because he was
away from his wife during much of their
short life together, while he worked as
a professor of physics and chemistry in
Bourg. After her death, Ampère was
appointed professor of mathematics at
the University of Lyon and then in 1809
at the Ècole Polytechnique in Paris. Af-
ter hearing that a current-carrying wire
could attract a compass needle in 1820,
Ampère quickly developed the theory of
electromagnetism. (Wikipedia)

Ampere’s Law
The Biot-Savart law (1.12) can also be used to derive Ampere’s law. Ampere’s law
is merely the inversion of the Biot-Savart law (1.12) so that J appears by itself,
unfettered by integrals or the like.

The latter term in (1.19) vanishes if

(steady-state approximation) (1.20)
in which case we have succeeded in isolating J and obtained Ampere’s law.
Without Maxwell’s correction, Ampere’s law
∇×B = µ0J
(1.21)
only applies to quasi steady-state situations. The physical interpretation of Am-
pere’s law is more apparent in integral form. We integrate both sides of (1.21) over
an open surface S, bounded by contour C and apply Stokes’ theorem (0.12) to the
left-hand side:

This law says that the line integral of B around a closed loop C is proportional to
the total current ﬂowing through the loop (see Fig. 1.5). The units of J are current
per area, so the surface integral containing J yields the current I in units of charge
per time.

Maxwell’s Adjustment to Ampere’s Law
Maxwell was the ﬁrst to realize that Ampere’s law was incomplete as written in
(1.21) since there exist situations where ∇·J ̸= 0 (especially the case for optical
phenomena). Maxwell ﬁgured out that (1.20) should be replaced with
∇·J = −∂ρ
∂t
(1.23)
This is called the continuity equation for charge and current densities. Simply
stated, if there is net current ﬂowing into a volume there ought to be charge piling
up inside. For the steady-state situation inherently considered by Ampere, the
current into and out of a volume is balanced so that ∂ρ
±
∂t = 0.
Derivation of the Continuity Equation
Consider a volume of space enclosed by a surface S through which current is
ﬂowing. The total current exiting the volume is
I =
I
S
J· ˆn da
(1.24)

32
Chapter 1 Electromagnetic Phenomena
where ˆn is the outward normal to the surface. The units on this equation are that
of current, or charge per time, leaving the volume.
Since we have considered a closed surface S, the net current leaving the enclosed
volume V must be the same as the rate at which charge within the volume vanishes:
I = −∂

Since (1.26) is true regardless of which volume V we choose, it implies (1.23).
James Clerk Maxwell (18311879,
Scottish) was born to a wealthy family
in Edinburgh, Scotland. Originally, his
name was John Clerk, but he added his
mother's maiden name when he inher-
ited an estate from her family. Maxwell
was a bright and inquisitive child and
displayed an unusual gift for mathe-
matics at an early age. He attended
Edinburgh University and then Trin-
ity College at Cambridge University.
Maxwell started his career as a professor
at Aberdeen University, but lost his job
a few years later during restructuring,
at which time Maxwell took a post at
King's College of London. Maxwell is
best known for his fundamental contri-
butions to electricity and magnetism
and the kinetic theory of gases. He
studied numerous other subjects, includ-
ing the human perception of color and
color-blindness, and is credited with pro-
ducing the rst color photograph. He
originally postulated that electromag-
netic waves propagated in a mechanical
luminiferous ether. He founded the
Cavendish laboratory at Cambridge in
1874, which has produced 28 Nobel
prizes to date. Maxwell, one of Ein-
stein's heros, died of stomach cancer in
his forties. (Wikipedia)
Maxwell’s main contribution (aside from organizing other people’s formulas9
and recognizing them as a complete set of coupled differential equations—a big
deal) was the injection of the continuity equation (1.23) into the derivation of
Ampere’s law (1.19). This yields

Then substitution of (1.7) into this formula gives
∇× B

the last of Maxwell’s equations (1.4).
This revised version of Ampere’s law includes the additional term ϵ0∂E/∂t,
which is known as the displacement current (density). The displacement current
exists even in the absence of any actual charge density ρ.10 It indicates that
a changing electric ﬁeld behaves like a current in the sense that it produces
magnetic ﬁelds. The similarity between Faraday’s law and the corrected Ampere’s
law (1.4) is apparent. No doubt this played a part in motivating Maxwell’s work.
In summary, in the previous section we saw that the basic physics in Ampere’s
law is present in the Biot-Savart law. Infusing it with charge conservation (1.23)
yields the corrected form of Ampere’s law.
9Although Gauss developed his law in 1835, it was not published until after his death in 1867,
well after Maxwell published his laws of electromagnetism, so in practice Maxwell accomplished
much more than merely ﬁxing Ampere’s law.
10Based on (1.27), one might think that the displacement current ϵ0∂E/∂t ought to be zero in a
region of space with no charge density ρ. However, in (1.27) ρ appears in a volume integral over a
region of space sufﬁciently large (consistent with a previous supposition) to include any charges
responsible for the ﬁeld E; presumably, all ﬁelds arise from sources.

Example 1.4
(a) Use Gauss’ law to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld in a gap that interrupts a current-carrying
wire, as shown in Fig. 1.6.
(b) Find the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld on contour C using Ampere’s law applied
to surface S1.
(c) Show that the displacement current in the gap leads to the identical magnetic
ﬁeld when using surface S2.
Solution: (a) We’ll assume that the cross-sectional area of the wire A is much wider
than the gap separation. Then the electric ﬁeld in the gap will be uniform, and the
integral on the left-hand side of (1.10) reduces to E A since there is essentially no
ﬁeld other than in the gap. If the accumulated charge on the ‘plate’ is Q, then the
right-hand side of (1.10) integrates to Q/ϵ0, and the electric ﬁeld turns out to be
E = Q/(ϵ0A).

Polarization of Materials
We are essentially ﬁnished with our analysis of Maxwell’s equations except for a
brief discussion of current density J and charge density ρ. For convenience, it is
common to decompose the current density into three categories:
J = Jfree +Jm +Jp
(1.28)
First, as you might expect, currents can arise from free charges in motion such
as electrons in a metal, referred to as Jfree. Second, individual atoms can exhibit
internal currents that give rise to paramagnetic and diamagnetic effects, denoted
by Jm. These are seldom important in optics problems, and so we will ignore these
types of currents by writing Jm = 0. Third, molecules in a material can elongate,
becoming dipoles in response to an applied electric ﬁeld. This gives rise to a
polarization current Jp.
Figure 1.7 A polarized medium
with ∇·P = 0.
The polarization current is associated with a dipole distribution function P,
called the polarization11 (in units of dipoles per volume, or charge times length
per volume). Physically, if the dipoles (depicted in Fig. 1.7) change their strength
or orientation as a function of time, an effective current density arises in the
medium. Note that the time-derivative of an individual dipole moment renders
charge times velocity. Thus, the time derivative of ‘sloshing’ dipoles per volume
gives a current density equal to
Jp = ∂P
∂t
(1.29)
Next, we turn our attention to the charge density, which is often decomposed
as
ρ = ρfree +ρp
(1.30)
We seldom consider the propagation of electromagnetic waveforms through
electrically charged materials, and so in this book we will always write ρfree = 0.
One might be tempted in this case to assume that the overall charge density is
zero, but this would be wrong. Even though a material is electrically neutral, the
polarization P can vary in space, leading to local concentrations of positive or
negative charges. This type of charge density is denoted by ρp. It arrises from
nonuniform arrangements of dipoles, as depicted in Fig. 1.8.
Figure 1.8 A polarized medium
with ∇·P ̸= 0.
To connect ρp with P, we write the continuity equation (1.23) for the current
and charge densities associated with the polarization:
∇·Jp = −
∂ρp
∂t
(1.31)
Substitution of (1.29) into this equation immediately yields
ρp = −∇·P
(1.32)
11Unfortunately, the word polarization gets double usage. It also refers to the orientation of the
electric ﬁeld in electromagnetic waves, which is the topic of chapter 6.

1.7 The Wave Equation
35
Example 1.6 To better appreciate local buildup of charge due to variation in
the medium polarization, consider the divergence theorem (0.11) applied
to P:
−
I
S
P(r)· ˆn da = −
Z
V
∇·P(r)dv
The left-hand side is a surface integral, which after integrating gives units of
charge. Physically, it is the sum of the charges touching the inside of surface
S (multiplied by a minus since by convention dipole vectors point from
the negatively charged end of a molecule to the positively charged end).
When ∇·P is zero, there are equal numbers of positive and negative charges
touching S from within, as depicted in Fig. 1.7. When ∇·P is not zero, the
positive and negative charges touching S are not balanced, as depicted in
Fig. 1.8. Essentially, excess charge ends up within the volume because the
non-uniform alignment of dipoles causes them to be cut preferentially at
the surface.12
In summary, in electrically neutral non-magnetic media, Maxwell’s equations
(in terms of the medium polarization P) are13

The Wave Equation
When Maxwell uniﬁed electromagnetic theory, he immediately noticed that waves
are solutions to his set of equations. In fact his desire to ﬁnd a set of equations that
allowed for waves aided his effort to ﬁnd the correct equations. After all, it was
already known that light traveled as waves. Kirchhoff had previously pointed out
12The ﬁgures may give the impression that you could always just draw a surface that avoids
cutting any dipoles. However, the function P(r) is continuous, while the ﬁgures depict crudely just
a few dipoles. In a continuous material you can’t draw a surface that avoids cutting dipoles.
13It is not uncommon to see the macroscopic Maxwell equations written in terms of two auxiliary
ﬁelds: H and D. The ﬁeld H is useful in magnetic materials. In these materials, the combination
B
±
µ0 in Ampere’s law is replaced by H ≡B/µ0 −M, where Jm = ∇×M is the current associated with
the material’s magnetization. Since we only consider nonmagnetic materials (M = 0), there is little
point in using H. The ﬁeld D, called the displacement, is deﬁned as D ≡ϵ0E+P. This combination
of E and P occurs in Coulomb’s law and Ampere’s law. For physical clarity, the authors of this book
elect to retain the prominence of the polarization P in the equations.

Chapter 1 Electromagnetic Phenomena
that 1
±pϵ0µ0 gives the correct speed of light c = 3×108 m/s (which had previously
been measured). Faraday and Kerr had observed that strong magnetic and electric
ﬁelds affect light propagating in crystals. The time was right to suspect that light
was an electromagnetic phenomena taking place at high frequency.
At ﬁrst glance, Maxwell’s equations might not immediately suggest (to the
inexperienced eye) that waves are solutions. However, we can manipulate the
equations (ﬁrst order differential equations that couple E to B) into the familiar
wave equation (decoupled second order differential equations for either E or B).
You should become familiar with this derivation. In what follows, we will derive
the wave equation for E. The derivation of the wave equation for B is very similar
(see problem P1.6).
Derivation of the Wave Equation
Taking the curl of (1.3) gives
∇×(∇×E)+ ∂
∂t (∇×B) = 0
(1.37)
We may eliminate ∇×B by substitution from (1.4), which gives
∇×(∇×E)+µ0ϵ0
∂2E
∂t2 = −µ0
∂J
∂t
(1.38)
Next we apply the vector identity (0.10), ∇×(∇×E) = ∇(∇·E)−∇2E, and use Gauss’
law (1.1) to replace the term ∇·E, which brings us to
∇2E−µ0ϵ0
∂2E
∂t2 = µ0
∂J
∂t + ∇ρ
ϵ0
(1.39)
If we perform the above derivation starting from (1.33)-(1.36) (or equivalently,
if we substitute (1.28)-(1.32) into (1.39)), we obtain the more-useful-for-optics
form

∇(∇·P)
(1.40)
The left-hand side of (1.40), when set to zero, is the familiar wave equation.
However, the right-hand side contains a number of ‘source terms’, which arise
when various currents and/or polarizations are present. The ﬁrst term on the
right-hand side of (1.40) describes currents of free charges, which are important
for determining the reﬂection of light from a metallic surface or for determining
the propagation of light in a plasma. The second term on the right-hand side
describes dipole oscillations, which behave similar to currents. These dipole oscil-
lations play a prominent role when light propagates in non-conducting materials.
The ﬁnal term on the right-hand side of (1.40) is important in anisotropic media
such as crystals. In this case, the polarization P responds to the electric ﬁeld along
a direction not necessarily parallel to E, due to the inﬂuence of the crystal lattice
(addressed in chapter 5).

1.7 The Wave Equation
37
In summary, when light propagates in a material, at least one of the terms on
the right-hand side of (1.40) will be non zero. As an example, in glass, Jfree = 0 and
∇·P = 0, but ∂2P
±
∂t2 ̸= 0 since the medium polarization responds to the light
ﬁeld, giving rise to refractive index (discussed in chapter 2).
Example 1.7
Show that the electric ﬁeld
E = (αx2y3ˆx+βz4ˆy)cosωt

The two expressions are identical, and the wave equation is satisﬁed.14
The magnetic ﬁeld B satisﬁes a similar wave equation, decoupled from E (see
P1.6). However, the two waves are not independent. The ﬁelds for E and B must
be chosen to be consistent with each other through Maxwell’s equations. After
solving the wave equation (1.40) for E, one can obtain the consistent B from E via
Faraday’s law (1.35).
In vacuum all of the terms on the right-hand side in (1.40) are zero, in which
case the wave equation reduces to
∇2E−µ0ϵ0
∂2E
∂t2 = 0
(vacuum) (1.41)
14The expressions in Example 1.7 hardly look like waves. The (quite unlikely) current and charge
distributions, which ﬁll all space, would have to be artiﬁcially induced rather than arise naturally in
response to a ﬁeld disturbance on a medium.

38
Chapter 1 Electromagnetic Phenomena
Solutions to this equation can take on every imaginable functional shape (speci-
ﬁed at a given instant—the evolution thereafter being controlled by (1.41)). More-
over, since the differential equation is linear, any number of solutions can be
added together to create other valid solutions. Consider the subclass of solutions
that propagate in a particular direction. These waveforms preserve shape while
traveling with speed
c ≡1
±pϵ0µ0 = 2.9979×108 m/s
(1.42)
In this case, E depends on the argument ˆu·r−ct, where ˆu is a unit vector specifying
the direction of propagation. The shape is preserved since features occurring at a
given position recur ‘downstream’ at a distance ct after a time t. By checking this
solution in (1.41), one conﬁrms that the speed of propagation is c (see P1.8). As
mentioned previously, one may add together any combination of solutions (even
with differing directions of propagation) to form other valid solutions.

Ole Roemer (16441710, Danish) was
a man of many interests. In addition to
measuring the speed of light, he created
a temperature scale which with slight
modication became the Fahrenheit
scale, introduced a system of standard
weights and measures, and was heavily
involved in civic aairs (city planning,
etc.). Scientists initially became inter-
ested in Io's orbit because its eclipse
(when it went behind Jupiter) was an
event that could be seen from many
places on earth. By comparing accurate
measurements of the local time when Io
was eclipsed by Jupiter at two remote
places on earth, scientists in the 1600s
were able to determine the longitude
dierence between the two places.

Ole Roemer made the ﬁrst successful measurement of the speed of light
in 1676 by observing the orbital period of Io, a moon of Jupiter with a
period of 42.5 hours. When Earth is moving toward Jupiter, the period
is measured to be shorter than 42.5 hours because light indicating the
end of the moon’s orbit travels less distance than light indicating the
beginning. When Earth is moving away from Jupiter, the situation is
reversed, and the period is measured to be longer than 42.5 hours.
(a) If you were to measure the time for 40 observed orbits of Io when
Earth is moving directly toward Jupiter and then several months later
measure the time for 40 observed orbits when Earth is moving directly
away from Jupiter, what would you expect the difference between these
two measurements be? Take the Earth’s orbital radius to be 1.5×1011 m.
To simplify the geometry, just assume that Earth moves directly toward
or away from Jupiter over the entire 40 orbits (see Fig. 1.12).

P1.12
In an isotropic nonconducting medium (i.e. ∇·P = 0, Jfree = 0), the po-
larization under certain assumptions can be written as function of the
electric ﬁeld: P = ϵ0χ(E)E, where χ(E) = χ1+χ2E+χ3E2 ···. The higher
order coefﬁcients in the expansion (i.e. χ2, χ3, ...) are typically small, so
only the ﬁrst term is important unless the ﬁeld is very strong. Nonlinear
optics deals with the study of intense light-matter interactions, where
the higher-order terms in the expansion become important. This can
lead to phenomena such as harmonic generation.

Chapter 2
Plane Waves and Refractive Index
In this chapter, we study sinusoidal solutions of Maxwell’s equations, called plane
waves. Restricting our attention to plane waves may seem limiting at ﬁrst, since
(as mentioned in chapter 1) an endless variety of waveform shapes can satisfy
the wave equation in vacuum. It turns out, however, that an arbitrary waveform
can always be constructed from a linear superposition of sinusoidal waves. Thus,
there is no loss of generality if we focus our attention on plane-wave solutions.
In a material, the electric ﬁeld of a plane wave induces oscillating dipoles,
and these oscillating dipoles in turn alter the electric ﬁeld. We use the index of
refraction to describe this effect. Plane waves of different frequencies experience
different refractive indices, which causes them to travel at different speeds in
materials. Thus, an arbitrary waveform, which is composed of multiple sinusoidal
waves, invariably changes shape as it travels in a material, as the different sinu-
soidal waves change relationship with respect to one another. This dispersion
phenomenon is a primary reason why physicists and engineers choose to work
with sinusoidal waves. Every waveform except for individual sinusoidal waves
changes shape as it travels in a material.
When describing plane waves, it is convenient to employ complex numbers
to represent physical quantities. This is particularly true for problems involving
absorption, which takes place in metals and, to a lesser degree (usually), in
dielectric material (e.g. glass). When the electric ﬁeld is represented using complex
notation, the index of refraction also becomes a complex number. You should
make sure you are comfortable with the material in section 0.2 before proceeding.

Here φ represents an arbitrary (constant) phase term. The vector k, called the
wave vector, may be written as
k ≡k ˆu = 2π
λvac
ˆu
(vacuum) (2.3)
where k has units of inverse length, ˆu is a unit vector deﬁning the direction of
propagation, and λvac is the length by which r must vary (in the direction of ˆu) to
cause the cosine to go through a complete cycle. This distance is known as the
(vacuum) wavelength. The frequency of oscillation is related to the wavelength via
ω = 2πc
λvac
(vacuum) (2.4)
The frequency ω has units of radians per second. Frequency is also often ex-
pressed as ν ≡ω/2π in units of cycles per second or Hz. Notice that k and ω
cannot be chosen independently; the wave equation requires them to be related
through the dispersion relation
k = ω

Typical values for λvac are given in Fig. 2.1. Sometimes the spatial period of the
wave is expressed as 1/λvac, in units of cm−1, called the wave number.

A magnetic wave accompanies any electric wave, and it obeys a similar wave
equation (see P1.6). The magnetic wave corresponding to (2.2) is
B(r,t) = B0 cos
¡
k·r−ωt +φ
¢
,
(2.6)
It is important to note that B0, k, ω, and φ are not independently chosen in (2.6).
In order to satisfy Faraday’s law (1.3), the arguments of the cosine in (2.2) and
(2.6) must be identical. Therefore, in vacuum the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
travel in phase. In addition, Faraday’s law requires (see P1.2)
B0 = k×E0
ω
(2.7)
The above cross product means that B0, is perpendicular to both E0 and k. Mean-
while, Gauss’ law ∇·E = 0 forces k to be perpendicular to E0. It follows that the
magnitudes of the ﬁelds are related through B0 = kE0/ω or B0 = E0/c, in view of
(2.5).
The inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld only becomes important (in comparison
to the electric ﬁeld) for charged particles moving near the speed of light. This
typically takes place only for extremely intense lasers (> 1018 W/cm2, see P2.12)
where the electric ﬁeld is sufﬁciently strong to cause electrons to oscillate with
velocities near the speed of light. We will be interested in optics problems that take
place at far less intensity where the effects of the magnetic ﬁeld can typically be
safely ignored. Throughout the remainder of this book, we will focus our attention
mainly on the electric ﬁeld with the understanding that we can at any time deduce
the (less important) magnetic ﬁeld from the electric ﬁeld via Faraday’s law.

2.2 Complex Plane Waves
45
Figure 2.2 depicts the electric ﬁeld (2.2) and the associated magnetic ﬁeld (2.6).
The ﬁgure is deceptive since the ﬁelds don’t actually look like transverse waves on
a string. The wave is comprised of large planar sheets of uniform ﬁeld strength
(difﬁcult to draw). The name plane wave is given since a constant argument in
(2.2) at any moment describes a plane, which is perpendicular to k. A plane wave
ﬁlls all space and may be thought of as a series of inﬁnite sheets, each with a
different uniform ﬁeld strength, moving in the k direction.

and magnetic ﬁelds associated
with a plane wave.
2.2
Complex Plane Waves
At this point, let’s rewrite our plane wave solution using complex number notation.
Although this change in notation will not make the task at hand any easier (and
may even appear to complicate things), we introduce the complex notation here
in preparation for later sections, where it will save considerable labor. (For a
review of complex notation, see section 0.2.)
Using complex notation we rewrite (2.2) as
E(r,t) = Re
n
˜E0ei(k·r−ωt)o
(2.8)
where we have hidden the phase term φ inside of ˜E0 as follows:1
˜E0 ≡E0eiφ
(2.9)
The next step we take is to become intentionally sloppy. Physicists throughout
the world have conspired to avoid writing Re{ } in an effort (or lack thereof if
you prefer) to make expressions less cluttered. Nevertheless, only the real part of
the ﬁeld is physically relevant even though expressions and calculations contain
both real and imaginary terms. This sloppy notation is okay since the real and
imaginary parts of complex numbers never intermingle when adding, subtracting,
differentiating, or integrating. We can delay taking the real part of the expression
until the end of the calculation. Also, when hiding a phase φ inside of the ﬁeld
amplitude as in (2.8), we drop the tilde (might as well since we are already being
sloppy); we will automatically assume that the ﬁeld amplitude is complex and
contains phase information. Putting this all together, our plane wave solution in
complex notation is written simply as
E(r,t) = E0ei(k·r−ωt)
(2.10)
It is possible to construct any electromagnetic disturbance from a linear superpo-
sition of such waves, which we will do in chapter 7.
1We have assumed that each vector component of the ﬁeld propagates with the same phase. To
be more general, one could write ˜E0 ≡ˆxE0xeiφx + ˆyE0yeiφy + ˆzE0zeiφz.

Upon insertion into (2.1) we obtain the vacuum dispersion relation (2.5), which
speciﬁes the connection between the wavenumber k and the frequency ω.
2.3
Index of Refraction
Now let’s examine how plane waves behave in dielectric media (e.g. glass). We
assume an isotropic,2 homogeneous,3 and non-conducting medium (i.e. Jfree = 0).
In this case, we expect E and P to be parallel to each other so ∇·P = 0 from (1.33).4
The general wave equation (1.40) for the electric ﬁeld reduces in this case to
∇2E−ϵ0µ0
∂2E
∂t2 = µ0
∂2P
∂t2
(2.13)
Since we are considering sinusoidal waves, we consider solutions of the form
E = E0ei(k·r−ωt)
P = P0ei(k·r−ωt)
(2.14)
By writing this, we are making the (reasonable) assumption that if an electric
ﬁeld stimulates a medium at frequency ω, then the polarization in the medium
also oscillates at frequency ω. This assumption is typically rather good except
for extreme electric ﬁelds, which can generate frequency harmonics through
nonlinear effects (see P1.12). Recall that by our prior agreement, the complex
amplitudes of E0 and P0 carry phase information. Thus, while E and P in (2.14)
oscillate at the same frequency, they can be out of phase with respect to each
other. This phase discrepancy is most pronounced for materials that absorb
energy at the plane wave frequency.
2Isotropic means the material behaves the same for propagation in any direction. Many crystals
are not isotropic as we’ll see in Chapter 5.
3Homogeneous means the material is everywhere the same throughout space.
4This follows for a wave of the form (2.14) if P and k are perpendicular.

2.3 Index of Refraction
47
Substitution of the trial solutions (2.14) into (2.13) yields
−k2E0ei(k·r−ωt) +ϵ0µ0ω2E0ei(k·r−ωt) = −µ0ω2P0ei(k·r−ωt)
(2.15)
To go further, we need to make an explicit connection between E0 and P0 (exter-
nal to Maxwell’s equations). In a linear medium, the polarization amplitude is
proportional to the strength of the applied electric ﬁeld:
P0 (ω) = ϵ0χ(ω)E0 (ω)
(2.16)
This is known as a constitutive relation. We have introduced a (to-be-determined)
dimensionless proportionality factor χ(ω) called the susceptibility. We account for
the possibility that E and P oscillate out of phase by allowing χ(ω) to be a complex
number. Since χ(ω) in general depends on the frequency, we appropriately must
think of P0 and E0 also as functions of ω.
By inserting (2.16) into (2.15) and canceling the ﬁeld terms, we obtain the
dispersion relation in dielectrics:
k2 = ϵ0µ0
£
1+χ(ω)
¤
ω2
or
k = ω
c
p
1+χ(ω)
(2.17)
where we have used c ≡1/pϵ0µ0. The oft-used combination ϵ ≡ϵ0(1+χ) is called
the permittivity of the material5; we will stick with writing out 1+χ. In general,
χ(ω) is a complex number, which leads to a complex index of refraction, deﬁned
by
N (ω) ≡n(ω)+iκ(ω) =
p
1+χ(ω)
(2.18)
where n and κ are respectively the real and imaginary parts of the index. (Note
that κ is not k.) According to (2.17), the magnitude of the wave vector is also
complex according to
k = N ω
c
= (n +iκ)ω
c
(2.19)
Please keep in mind that the use of a complex index of refraction only makes
sense in the context of complex representation for a plane wave.
The complex index N takes into account absorption as well as the usual
oscillatory behavior of the wave. We see this by explicitly placing (2.19) into
(2.14):
E(r,t) = E0ei(k ˆu·r−ωt) = E0e−κω
c ˆu·rei
¡ nω
c ˆu·r−ωt
¢
(2.20)
As before, ˆu is a real unit vector specifying the direction of k. Again, when looking
at (2.20), by special agreement in advance, we should just think of the real part,
namely
E(r,t) = E0e−κω
c ˆu·r cos
³nω
c ˆu·r−ωt +φ
´
(2.21)
5Electrodynamics books often use the electric displacement D ≡ϵ0E+P = ϵE. See M. Born and
E. Wolf, Principles of Optics, 7th ed., p. 3 (Cambridge University Press, 1999). The permittivity ϵ
encapsulates the constitutive relation that connects P with E.The index of refraction is given by
N = pϵ/ϵ0.

where an overall phase φ was formerly held in the complex vector ˜E0.6 (The
tilde had been suppressed.) Figure 2.3 shows a graph of (2.21). The imaginary
part of the index κ causes the wave to decay as it travels. This accounts for
absorption. The real part of the index n is associated with the oscillations of the
wave. By inspection of the cosine argument in (2.21), we see that the speed of the
(diminishing) sinusoidal wave fronts is
vphase(ω) = c /n(ω)
(2.22)
It is apparent that n(ω) is the ratio of the speed of the light in vacuum to the speed
of the wave in the material.

Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (18531928,
Dutch) was born in Arnhem, Nether-
lands, the son a successful nurseryman.
Hendrick's mother died when he was
four years old. He studied classical lan-
guages and then entered the University
of Leiden where he was strongly inu-
enced by astronomy professor Frederik
Kaiser, whose niece Hendrik married.
Hendrik was persuaded to become a
physicist and wrote a doctoral disserta-
tion entitled On the theory of reection
and refraction of light, in which he
rened Maxwell's electromagnetic the-
ory. Lorentz correctly hypothesized that
the atoms were composed of charged
particles, and that their movement was
the source of light. He also derived the
transformations of space and time, later
used in Einstein's theory of relativity.
Lorentz won the Nobel prize in 1902
for his contributions to electromagnetic
theory. (Wikipedia)
2.4
The Lorentz Model of Dielectrics
To compute the index of refraction in either a dielectric or a conducting material,
we require a model that describes the response of electrons in the material to
the passing electric ﬁeld wave. Of course, the model in turn inﬂuences how the
electric ﬁeld propagates, which is what inﬂuences the material in the ﬁrst place!
The model therefore must be solved together with the propagating ﬁeld in a
self-consistent manner.
Hendrik Lorentz developed a very successful model in the late 1800s, which
treats each (active) electron in the medium as a classical particle obeying Newton’s
second law (F = ma). In the case of a dielectric medium, electrons are subject to
an elastic restoring force that keeps each electron bound to its respective molecule
and a damping force that dissipates energy and gives rise to absorption.
The Lorentz model determines the susceptibility χ(ω) (the connection be-
tweene the electric ﬁeld E0 and the polarization P0) and hence the index of refrac-
tion. The model assumes that all molecules in the medium are identical, each
with one (or a few) active electrons responding to the external ﬁeld. The atoms
are uniformly distributed throughout space with N identical active electrons per
volume (units: number per volume). The polarization of the material is then
P = Nqere
(2.31)
7It is possible to have n < 0 for so called meta materials, not considered here.

50
Chapter 2 Plane Waves and Refractive Index
Recall that polarization has units of dipoles per volume. Each dipole has strength
qere, where re is a microscopic displacement of the electron from equilibrium.
At the time of Lorentz, atoms were thought to be clouds of positive charge
wherein point-like electrons sat at rest unless stimulated by an applied electric
ﬁeld. In our modern quantum-mechanical viewpoint, re corresponds to an av-
erage displacement of the electronic cloud, which surrounds the nucleus (see
Fig. 2.4). The displacement re of the electron charge in an individual atom de-
pends on the local strength of the applied electric ﬁeld E at the position of the
atom. Since the diameter of the electronic cloud is tiny compared to a wavelength
of (visible) light, we make the approximation that the electric ﬁeld is uniform
across any individual atom.

In an electric field
Figure 2.4 A distorted electronic
cloud becomes a dipole.
The Lorentz model uses Newton’s equation of motion to describe an electron
displacement from equilibrium within an atom. In accordance with the classical
laws of motion, the electron mass me times its acceleration is equal to the sum of
the forces on the electron:
me¨re = qeE−meγ˙re −kHookere
(2.32)
The electric ﬁeld pulls on the electron with force qeE.8 A drag force (or friction)
−meγ˙re opposes the electron motion and accounts for absorption of energy.
Without this term, it is only possible to describe optical index at frequencies away
from where absorption takes place. Finally, −kHookere is a force accounting for
the fact that the electron is bound to the nucleus. This restoring force can be
thought of as an effective spring that pulls the displaced electron back towards
equilibrium with a force proportional to the amount of displacement, so this
term is essentially the familiar Hooke’s law. With some rearranging, (2.32) can be
written as
¨re +γ˙re +ω2
0re = qe
me
E
(2.33)
where ω0 ≡
p
kHooke/me is the natural oscillation frequency (or resonant fre-
quency) associated with the electron mass and the ‘spring constant.’
There is a subtle problem with our analysis, which we will continue to neglect,
but which should be mentioned. The ﬁeld E in (2.32) is the net ﬁeld, which is
inﬂuenced by the presence of all of the dipoles. The actual ﬁeld that a dipole
‘feels’, however, does not include its own ﬁeld. That is, we should remove from E
the ﬁeld produced by each dipole in its own vicinity. This signiﬁcantly modiﬁes
the result if the density of the material is sufﬁciently high. This effect is described
by the Clausius-Mossotti formula, which is treated in appendix 2.B.
In accordance with our examination of a single sinusoidal wave, we insert
(2.14) into (2.33) and obtain
¨re +γ˙re +ω2
0re = qe
me
E0ei(k·r−ωt)
(2.34)
8The electron also experiences a force due to the magnetic ﬁeld of the light, F = qeve ×B, but
this force is tiny for typical optical ﬁelds.

2.4 The Lorentz Model of Dielectrics
51
As a reminder, within a given atom the excursions of re are assumed to be so small
that k · r remains essentially constant. After all, k · r varies typically on a scale
of an optical wavelength, which is huge compared to the size of an atom. The
inhomogeneous solution to (2.34) is (see P2.1)

The electron position re oscillates (not surprisingly) with the same frequency ω as
the driving electric ﬁeld. This solution illustrates the convenience of complex no-
tation. The imaginary part in the denominator implies that the electron oscillates
with a phase different from the electric ﬁeld oscillations; the damping term γ (the
imaginary part in the denominator) causes the two to be out of phase somewhat.
The complex algebra in (2.35) accomplishes quite easily what would otherwise be
cumbersome (i.e. working out a trigonometric phase).

where f j is the aptly named the oscillator strength for the j th species of active
electron, inserted into the model without justiﬁcation to make results better agree
with observation. Each species also has its own plasma frequency ωp j, natural
frequency ω0 j, and damping coefﬁcient γj. For frequency ranges where ωγj and
κ can be ignored (i.e. away from resonances ω0 j), it is common to write Lorentz’s
refractive-index formula (2.40) in terms of λvac = 2πc/ω, in which case it is known
as the Sellmeier equation. (See P2.2.)
Lorentz introduced this model well before the development of quantum
mechanics. Even though the model pays no attention to quantum physics, it
works surprisingly well for describing frequency-dependent optical indices and
absorption of light. As it turns out, the Schrödinger equation applied to two levels
in an atom reduces in mathematical form to the Lorentz model in the limit of
low-intensity light. Quantum mechanics also explains the oscillator strength,
which before the development of quantum mechanics had to be inserted ad hoc
to make the model agree with experiments. The friction term γ turns out not to be
associated with something internal to atoms but rather with collisions between
atoms, which on average give rise to the same behavior.
2.5
Index of Refraction of a Conductor
In a conducting medium, the outer electrons of atoms are free to move without
being tethered to any particular atom. However, the electrons are still subject to a
damping force due to collisions that remove energy and give rise to absorption.
Such collisions are associated with resistance in a conductor. As it turns out,
we can obtain a simple formula for the refractive index of a conductor from the
Lorentz model in section 2.4. We simply remove the restoring force that binds
electrons to their atoms. That is, we set ω0 = 0 in (2.39), which gives
(n +iκ)2 = 1−
ω2

iωγ+ω2
(2.41)
This underscores the fact that ∂P/∂t is a current very much like Jfree. When
we remove the restoring force kHooke = meω2
0 from the atomic model, the elec-
trons effectively become free, and it is not surprising that they exactly mimic the
behavior of a free current Jfree. A graph of n and κ in the conductor model is given
in Fig. 2.7. Below, we provide the derivation for (2.41) in the context of Jfree rather
than as a limiting case of the dielectric model.10

We assume that the current is made up of individual electrons traveling with
velocity ve:
Jfree = Nqeve
(2.43)
As before, N is the number density of free electrons (in units of number per vol-
ume). Recall that current density Jfree has units of charge times velocity per volume
(or current per cross sectional area), so (2.43) may be thought of as a deﬁnition of
current density in a fundamental sense.
Again, the electrons satisfy Newton’s equation of motion, similar to (2.32) except
without a restoring force:
me¨re = qeE−meγ˙re
(2.44)
For a sinusoidal electric ﬁeld E = E0ei(k·r−ωt), the solution to this equation is

(2.45)
where again we assume that the electron oscillation excursions described by re are

Jfree =

Note that in the low-frequency limit (i.e. ω ≪γ), the current density (2.46)
reduces to Ohm’s law J = σE, where σ = Nq2
e /meγ is the DC conductivity. In
the high-frequency limit (i.e. ω ≫γ), the behavior changes over to that of a
free plasma, where collisions, which are responsible for resistance, become less
important since the excursions of the electrons during oscillations become very
small. This formula captures the general behavior of metals, but actual values of
the index vary from this somewhat (see P2.6 ).
In either the conductor or dielectric model, the damping term removes energy
from electron oscillations. The damping term gives rise to an imaginary part
of the index, which causes an exponential attenuation of the plane wave as it
propagates.

Poynting’s Theorem
Until now, we have described light as the propagation of an electromagnetic
disturbance. However, we typically observe light by detecting absorbed energy
rather than the ﬁeld amplitude directly. In this section we examine the connection
between propagating electromagnetic ﬁelds (such as the plane waves discussed
in this chapter) and the energy transported by such ﬁelds.
In the late 1800s John Poynting developed (from Maxwell’s equations) the the-
oretical foundation that describes light energy transport. You should appreciate
and remember the ideas involved, especially the deﬁnition and meaning of the
Poynting vector, even if you forget the speciﬁcs of its derivation.
John Henry Poynting (18521914,
English) was the youngest son of a Uni-
tarian minister who operated a school
near Manchester England where John
received his childhood education. He
later attended Owen's College in Manch-
ester and then went on to Cambridge
University where he distinguished him-
self in mathematics and worked under
James Maxwell in the Cavendish Lab-
oratory. Poynting joined the faculty of
the University of Birmingham (then
called Mason Science College) where
he was a professor of physics from 1880
until his death. Besides developing his
famous theorem on the conservation
of energy in electromagnetic elds, he
performed innovative measurements of
Newton's gravitational constant and
discovered that the Sun's radiation
draws in small particles towards it, the
Poynting-Robertson eect. Poynting
was the principal author of a multi-
volume undergraduate physics textbook,
which was in wide use until the 1930s.

Derivation of Poynting’s Theorem
We require just two of Maxwell’s Equations: (1.3) and (1.4). We take the dot product
of B/µ0 with the ﬁrst equation and the dot product of E with the second equation.
Then by subtracting the second equation from the ﬁrst we obtain

The ﬁrst two terms can be simpliﬁed using the vector identity P0.8. The next two

This is Poynting’s theorem. Each term in this equation has units of power per

It is conventional to write Poynting’s theorem as follows:11
∇·S+ ∂
∂t (uﬁeld +umedium) = 0
(2.51)
where
S ≡E× B

(2.52)
is called the Poynting vector, which has units of power per area, called irradiance.

is the energy per volume stored in the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Derivations of
the electric ﬁeld energy density and the magnetic ﬁeld energy density are given in
Appendices 2.C and 2.D. (See (2.79) and (2.86).) The derivative

2.6 Poynting’s Theorem

describes the power per volume delivered to the medium from the ﬁeld. Equa-
tion (2.54) is reminiscent of the familiar circuit power law, Power = Voltage ×
Current. Power is delivered when a charged particle traverses a distance while
experiencing a force. This happens when currents ﬂow in the presence of electric
ﬁelds.
Poynting’s theorem is essentially a statement of the conservation of energy,
where S describes the ﬂow of energy. To appreciate this, consider Poynting’s
theorem (2.51) integrated over a volume V (enclosed by surface S). If we also
apply the divergence theorem (0.11) to the term involving ∇·S we obtain
I

S· ˆn da = −∂

(2.55)
Notice that the volume integral over energy densities uﬁeld and umedium gives
the total energy stored in V , whether in the form of electromagnetic ﬁeld energy
density or as energy density that has been given to the medium. The integration
of the Poynting vector over the surface gives the net Poynting vector ﬂux directed
outward. Equation (2.55) indicates that the outward Poynting vector ﬂux matches
the rate that total energy disappears from the interior of V . Conversely, if the
Poynting vector is directed inward (negative), then the net inward ﬂux matches
the rate that energy increases within V . The vector S deﬁnes the ﬂow of energy
through space. Its units of power per area are just what is needed to describe the
brightness of light impinging on a surface.

It is common to replace the rapidly oscillating function cos2 (kz −ωt) with its time
average 1/2, but this would have inhibited our ability to take the above derivatives
needed in this speciﬁc problem.
2.7
Irradiance of a Plane Wave
In this section, we consider the irradiance of a plane wave while propagating
in matter. We start with the electric plane-wave ﬁeld E(r,t) = E0ei(k·r−ωt). The
magnetic ﬁeld that accompanies this electric ﬁeld can be found from Maxwell’s
equation (1.3), and it turns out to be (compare with problem P1.2)
B(r,t) = k×E0
ω
ei(k·r−ωt)
(2.56)
When k is complex, B is out of phase with E, and this occurs when absorption
takes place. On the other hand, when there is no absorption, then k is real, and B
and E carry the same complex phase.
Before computing the Poynting vector (2.52), which involves multiplication,
we must remember our unspoken agreement that only the real parts of the ﬁelds
are relevant. We necessarily remove the imaginary parts before multiplying (see
(0.22)). To obtain the real parts of the ﬁelds, we add their respective complex
conjugates and divide the result by 2 (see (0.30)). The real ﬁeld associated with
the plane-wave electric ﬁeld is
E(r,t) = 1

sake of simplicity.

Very often, we are interested in the time-average of the Poynting vector, denoted
by 〈S〉t, since there are no electronics that can keep up with the rapid oscillation of
visible light (i.e. > 1014 Hz). The ﬁrst and last terms in (2.59) rapidly oscillate and
vanish under time averaging.
Additionally, we can use the BAC-CAB rule P0.3 to write E∗

This expression shows that (in an isotropic medium) the ﬂow of energy is in the
direction of ˆu (or k). This agrees with our intuition that energy ﬂows in the direction
that the wave propagates.
The magnitude of expression (2.61) is the irradiance. However, we often refer
to it as the intensity of a ﬁeld I, which amounts to the same thing, but without
regard for the ﬂow of energy. The deﬁnition of intensity is thus less speciﬁc, and
it can be applied, for example, to standing waves where the net Poynting ﬂux of
counter-propagating plane waves is technically zero since the two plane waves
have equal amounts of energy, but propagate in opposite directions. Nevertheless,
atoms in standing waves ‘feel’ the oscillating ﬁeld, and we ascribe an intensity to
it.
In general, the intensity is written as

so that they correspond to the local electric ﬁeld. Equation (2.62) agrees with S in
Example 2.3 where n = 1 and E0 = ˆxE0 is real; the cosine squared averages to 1/2.

Table 2.1 Radiometric quantities
and units.
The ﬁeld of study that quantiﬁes the energy in electromagnetic radiation (in-
cluding visible light) is referred to as radiometry. Table 2.1 lists several concepts
important in radiometry. The radiance at a detector and the exitance from a
source are both direct measurements of the average Poynting ﬂux, and the other
quantities in the table are directly related to the Poynting ﬂux through geometric
factors. One of the challenges in radiometry is that light sensors always have a
wavelength-dependent sensitivity to light, whereas the quantities in Table 2.1
treat light of all wavelengths on equal footing. Disentangling the detector re-
sponse from the desired signal in a radiometric measurement takes considerable
care.
Photometry refers to the characterization of light energy in the context of the
response of the human eye. In contrast to radiometry, photometry takes great care
to mimic the wavelength-dependent effects of the eye-brain detection system so
that photometric quantities are an accurate reﬂection of our everyday experience
with light. The concepts used in photometry are similar to those in radiometry,
except that the radiometric quantities are multiplied by the spectral response of
our eye-brain system.
Our eyes contain two types of photoreceptors—rods and cones. The rods
are very sensitive and provide virtually all of our vision in dim light conditions
(e.g. when you are away from artiﬁcial light at night). Under these conditions we
experience scotoptic vision, with a response curve that peaks at λvac = 507 nm
and is insensitive to wavelengths longer than 640 nm12 (see Fig. 2.9). As the
light gets brighter the less-sensitive cones take over, and we experience photoptic
vision, with a response curve that peaks at λvac = 555 nm and drops to near zero
for wavelengths longer than λvac = 700 nm or shorter than λvac = 400 nm (see
Fig. 2.9). Photometric quantities are usually measured using the bright-light
(photoptic) response curve since that is what we typically experience in normally
lit spaces.

Photometric units, which may seem a little obscure, were ﬁrst deﬁned in terms
of an actual candle with prescribed dimensions made from whale tallow. The
basic unit of luminous power is called the lumen, deﬁned to be (1/683) W of light
with wavelength λvac = 555 nm, the peak of the eye’s bright-light response. More
radiant power is required to achieve the same number of lumens for wavelengths
away from the center of the eye’s spectral response. Photometric units are often
used to characterize room lighting as well as photographic, projection, and display
12Since rods do not detect the longer red wavelengths, it is possible to have artiﬁcial red illumina-
tion without ruining your dark-adapted vision. For example, an airplane can have red illumination
on the instrument panel without interfering with a pilot’s ability to achieve full dark-adapted vision
to see things outside the cockpit.

equipment. For example, both a 60 W incandescent bulb and a 13 W compact
ﬂuorescent bulb emit a little more than 800 lumens of light. The difference in
photometric output versus radiometric output reﬂects the fact that most of the
energy radiated from an incandescent bulb is emitted in the infrared, where
our eyes are not sensitive. Table 2.2 gives the names of the various photometric
quantities, which parallel the entries for radiometric quantities in Table 2.1. We

and units.
Cones come in three varieties, each of which is sensitive to light in different
wavelength bands. Figure 2.10 plots the normalized sensitivity curves13 for short
(S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelength cones. Because your brain gets separate
signals from each type of cone, this system gives you the ability to measure
basic information about the spectral content of light. We interpret this spectral
information as the color of the light. When the three types of cones are stimulated
equally the light appears white, and when they are stimulated differently the
light appears colored. Light with different spectral distributions can produce the
exact same color sensation, so our perception of color only gives very general
information about the spectral content of light. For example, light coming from
a television has a different spectral composition than the light incident on the
camera that recorded the image, but both can produce the same color sensation.
This ambiguity can lead to a potentially dangerous situation in the lab because
lasers from 670 nm to 800 nm all appear the same color. (They all stimulate the
L and M cones in essentially the same ratio.) However, your eye’s response falls
off quickly in the near-infrared, so a dangerous 800 nm high-intensity beam can
appear about the same brightness as an innocuous 670 nm laser pointer.
Because we have have three types of cones, our perception of color can be well-
represented using a three-dimensional vector space referred to as a color space.14
A color space can be deﬁned in terms of three “basis” light sources referred to
as primaries. Different colors (i.e. the “vectors” in the color space) are created
by mixing the primary light in different ratios. If we had three primaries that
separately stimulated each type of rod (S, M, and L), we could recreate any color
sensation exactly by mixing those primaries. However, by inspecting Fig. 2.10 you
can see that this ideal set of primaries cannot be found because of the overlap
between the S, M, and L curves. Any light that will stimulate one type of cone will

known genotype,” Vision Research, 40, 1711-1737 (2000).
14The methods we use to represent color are very much tied to human physiology. Other species
have photoreceptors that sense different wavelength ranges or do not sense color at all. For instance,
Papilio butterﬂies have six types of cone-like photoreceptors and certain types of shrimp have
twelve. Reptiles have four-color vision for visible light, and pit vipers (a subgroup of snakes) have
an additional set of “eyes” that look like pits on the front of their face. These pits are essentially
pinhole cameras sensitive to infrared light, and give these reptiles crude night-vision capabilities.
(Not surprisingly, pit vipers hunt most actively at night time.) On the other hand, some insects can
perceive markings on ﬂowers that are only visible in the ultraviolet. Each of these species would
ﬁnd the color spaces we use to record and recreate color sensations very inaccurate.

Chapter 2 Plane Waves and Refractive Index
also stimulate another. This overlap makes it impossible to display every possible
color with three primaries. (Although it is possible to quantify all colors with three
primaries, even if the primaries can’t display the colors—we’ll see how shortly.)
The range of colors that can be displayed with a given set of primaries is referred
to as the gamut of that color space. As your experience with computers suggests,
we are able engineer devices with a very broad gamut, but there are always colors
that cannot be displayed.
The CIE1931 RGB15 color space is a very commonly encountered color space
based on a series of experiments performed by W. David Wright and John Guild
in 1931. In these experiments, test subjects were asked to match the color of a
monochromatic test light source by mixing monochromatic primaries at 700 nm
(R), 546.1 nm (G), and 435.8 nm (B). The relative amount of R, G, and B light
required to match the color at each test wavelength was recorded as the color
matching functions ¯r(λ), ¯g(λ), and ¯b(λ), shown in Fig. 2.11. Note that the color
matching functions sometimes go negative. This is most noticeable for ¯r(λ), but
all three have negative values. These negative values indicate that the test color
was outside the gamut of the primaries (i.e. the color of the test source could not
be matched by adding primaries). In these cases, the observers matched the test
light as closely as possible by mixing primaries, and then they added some of the
primary light to the test light until the colors matched. The amount of primary
light that had to be added to the test light was recorded as a negative number. In
this way they were able to quantify the color, even though it couldn’t be displayed
using their primaries.

It turns out that the eye responds essentially linearly with respect to color
perception. That is, if an observer perceives one light source to have components
(R1,G1,B1) and another light source to have components (R2,G2,B2), a mixture
of the two lights will have components (R1 +R2,G1 +G2,B1 +B2). This linearity
allows us to calculate the color components of an arbitrary light source with

If R, G, or B turn out to be negative for a given I(λ), then that color of light
falls outside the gamut of these particular primaries. However, the negative
coordinates still provide a valid abstract representation of that color.
The RGB color space is an additive color model, where the primaries are added
together to produce color and the absence of light gives black. Subtractive color
models produce color using a background that reﬂects all visible light equally so
that it appears white (e.g. a piece of paper or canvas) and then placing absorbing
pigments over the background to remove portions of the reﬂected spectrum.
Some color spaces use four basis vectors. For example, color printers use
the subtractive CMYK color space (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black), and some

commission that deﬁnes lighting and color standards.

television manufacturers add a fourth type of primary (usually yellow) to their
display. The fourth basis vector increases the range of colors that can be displayed
by these systems (i.e. it increases the gamut). However, the fourth basis vector
makes the color space overdetermined and only helps in displaying colors—we
can abstractly represent all colors using just three coordinates (in an appropriately
chosen basis).

where X , Y , and Z are the color coordinates in the new basis. The matrix elements
in (2.64) were carefully chosen to give this color space some desirable properties:
none of the new coordinates (X , Y , or Z) are ever negative; the Y gives the pho-
tometric brightness of the light and the X and Z coordinates describe the color
part (i.e. the chromatisity) of the light; and the coordinates (1/3,1/3,1/3) give the
color white. The XYZ coordinates do not represent new primaries, but rather linear
combinations of the original primaries. Find the representation in the CIE1931

primaries contain negative amounts of the physical RGB primaries, the XYZ basis
is not physically realizable. However, it is extensively used because it can abstractly
represent all colors using a triplet of positive numbers.
Appendix 2.B
Clausius-Mossotti Relation
Equation (2.35) has the form re = αE/qe, where α is called the atomic (or molecu-
lar) polarizability. We take absorption to be negligible so that α is real. E is the
macroscopic ﬁeld in the medium, which includes a contribution from all of the
dipoles. To avoid double-counting the dipole’s own ﬁeld, we should replace E
with
Eactual ≡E−Edipole
(2.65)
and write
qere = αEactual
(2.66)

62
Chapter 2 Plane Waves and Refractive Index
That is, we ought not to allow the dipole’s own ﬁeld to act on itself as we previously
(inadvertently) did. Here Edipole is the average ﬁeld that a dipole contributes to its
quota of space in the material.
Since N is the number of dipoles per volume, each dipole occupies a volume
1/N. As will be shown below, the average ﬁeld due to a dipole16 centered in such
a volume (symmetrically chosen) is
Edipole = −Nqermicro
3ϵo
(2.67)
Substitution of (2.67) and (2.66) into (2.65) yields
Eeffective = E+ NαEactual
3ϵo
⇒
Eactual =
E
1−Nα
3ϵo
(2.68)
Then ( 2.66) becomes
qere =
αE
1−Nα
3ϵo
(2.69)
Now according to (2.16) the susceptibility is deﬁned via P = ϵ0χE, where E is
the macroscopic ﬁeld. Also, the polarization is always based on the combined be-
havior of all of the dipoles P = Nqermicro (see (2.31)). Therefore, the susceptibility
is
χ(ω) =
Nα(ω)
ϵo
1−Nα(ω)
3ϵo
(2.70)
This is known as the Clausius-Mossotti relation. In section 2.4, we only included
the numerator of (2.70). The extra term in the denominator becomes important
when N is sufﬁciently large, which is the case for liquid or solid densities.
Since we neglect absorption, from (2.25) we have χ = n2−1, and we may write
n2 −1 =
Nα/ϵ0
1−Nα/3ϵ0
(2.71)
In this case, we may invert the relation to write Nα/ϵ0 in terms of the index:17
Nα
ϵ0
= 3n2 −1
n2 +2
(2.72)
16In principle, the detailed ﬁelds of nearby dipoles should also be considered rather than repre-
senting their inﬂuence with the macroscopic ﬁeld. However, if they are symmetrically distributed
the result is the same. See J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., Sect. 4.5 (New York: John
Wiley, 1999).
17This form of Clausius-Mossotti relation, in terms of the refractive index, was renamed the
Lorentz-Lorenz formula, but probably undeservedly so, since it is essentially the same formula.

2.B Clausius-Mossotti Relation
63
Example 2.5
Xenon vapor at STP (density 4.46×10−5mol/cm3) has index n = 1.000702 measured
at wavelength 589nm. Use (a) the Clausius-Mossotti relation (2.70) and (b) the
uncorrected formula (i.e. numerator only) to predict the index for liquid xenon
with density 2.00×10−2mol/cm3. Compare with the measured value of n = 1.332.18
Solution: At the low density, we may may safely neglect the correction in the
denominator of (2.71) and simply write Natmα/ϵ0 = 1.0007022 −1 = 1.404×10−3.
The liquid density Nliquid is 2.00×10−2/4.46×10−5 = 449 times greater. Therefore,
Nliquidα/ϵ0 = 449×1.404×10−3 = 0.630. (a) According to Clausius-Mossotti (2.71),
the index is
n =
r
1+
0.630
1−0.630/3 = 1.341
(b) On the other hand, without the correction in the denominator, we get
n =
p
1+0.630 = 1.277
The Clausius-Mossotti formula gets much closer to the measured value.

This dipole-ﬁeld expression, while useful for describing the ﬁeld surrounding the dipole, contains
no information about the ﬁelds internal to the diple. Note that we integrate z through the origin,
which would violate the above assumption r ≫d. Alternatively, the inﬂuence of the internal ﬁelds
on our integral could be accomplished using a delta function as is done in J. D. Jackson, Classical
Electrodynamics, 3rd ed., p. 149 (New York: John Wiley, 1999).

if placed at any given point in the ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld and the potential are
connected through
E(r) = −∇φ(r)

We consider the potential to arise from the charges themselves. The factor 1/2
is necessary to avoid double counting. To appreciate this factor consider just
two point charges: We only need to count the energy due to one charge in the
presence of the other’s potential to obtain the energy required to bring the charges
together.

Energy Density of Magnetic Fields
In a derivation similar to that in appendix 2.C, we consider the energy associated
with magnetic ﬁelds.23 The magnetic vector potential A(r) (in units of energy
per charge×velocity) describes the potential energy that a charge moving with
velocity v would experience if placed in the ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld and the
vector potential are connected through
B(r) = ∇×A(r)

terms of a summation over all of the currents (or current density J(r)) located
within the vector potential ﬁeld:

As in (2.74), the factor 1/2 is necessary to avoid double counting the inﬂuence of

substitute Ampere’s law (1.21) into (2.81), which yields

accepted by the sRGB device (commonly 0 to 255) and then the sRGB
coordinates ˜R, ˜G, and ˜B need to be scaled or clipped to ﬁt in the appro-
priate range. (This scaling and clipping result from the fact that your
monitor cannot display arbitrarily bright light.)
Obtain a copy of the XYZ color matching functions from www.cvrl.org

Chapter 3
Reﬂection and Refraction
As we know from everyday experience, when light arrives at an interface between
materials it partially reﬂects and partially transmits. In this chapter, we examine
what happens to plane waves when they propagate from one material (charac-
terized by indices n or even by complex index N ) to another material. We will
derive expressions to quantify the amount of reﬂection and transmission. The
results depend on the angle of incidence (i.e. the angle between k and the surface
normal) as well as on the orientation of the electric ﬁeld (called polarization – not
to be confused with P, also called polarization). In this chapter, we consider only
isotropic materials (e.g. glass); in chapter 5 we consider anisotropic materials (e.g.
a crystal).
As we develop the connection between incident, reﬂected, and transmitted
light waves,1 several familiar relationships will emerge naturally (e.g. Snell’s law
and Brewster’s angle). The formalism also describes polarization-dependent
phase shifts upon reﬂection (especially interesting in the case of reﬂections from
metals).
For simplicity, we initially neglect the imaginary part of the refractive index.
Each plane wave is thus characterized by a real wave vector k. We will write each
plane wave in the form E(r,t) = E0 exp[i (k·r−ωt)], where, as usual, only the real
part of the ﬁeld corresponds to the physical ﬁeld. The restriction to real refractive
indices is not as serious as it might seem. The use of the letter n instead of N
hardly matters. The math is all the same, which demonstrates the power of the
complex notation. We can simply update our expressions in the end to include
complex refractive indices, but in the mean time it is easier to think of absorption
as negligible.

Refraction at an Interface
Consider a planar boundary between two materials with different indices. Let
index ni characterize the material on the left, and the index nt characterize the

material on the right, as depicted in the Fig. 3.1. When a plane wave traveling
in the direction ki is incident on the boundary from the left, it gives rise to a
reﬂected plane wave traveling in the direction kr and a transmitted plane wave
traveling in the direction kt. The incident and reﬂected waves exist only to the
left of the material interface, and the transmitted wave exists only to the right of
the interface. The angles θi, θr, and θt give the angles that each respective wave
vector (ki, kr, and kt) makes with the normal to the interface.
For simplicity, we’ll assume that both of the materials are isotropic here.
(Chapter 5 discusses refraction for anisotropic materials.) In this case, ki, kr, and
kt all lie in a single plane, referred to as the plane of incidence, (i.e. the plane
represented by the surface of this page). We are free to orient our coordinate
system in many different ways (and every textbook seems to do it differently!).2
We choose the y–z plane to be the plane of incidence, with the z-direction normal
to the interface and the x-axis pointing into the page.

Figure 3.1 Incident, reﬂected, and
transmitted plane wave ﬁelds at a
material interface.
The electric ﬁeld vector for each plane wave is conﬁned to a plane perpendic-
ular to its wave vector. We are free to decompose the ﬁeld vector into arbitrary
components as long as they are perpendicular to the wave vector. It is customary
to choose one of the electric ﬁeld vector components to be that which lies within
the plane of incidence. We call this p-polarized light, where p stands for parallel to
the plane of incidence. The remaining electric ﬁeld vector component is directed
normal to the plane of incidence and is called s-polarized light. The s stands for
senkrecht, a German word meaning perpendicular.
Using this system, we can decompose the electric ﬁeld vector Ei into its p-
polarized component E(p)
i
and its s-polarized component E(s)
i , as depicted in
Fig. 3.1. The s component E(s)
i
is represented by the tail of an arrow pointing
into the page, or the x-direction in our convention. The other ﬁelds Er and Et
are similarly split into s and p components as indicated in Fig. 3.1. All ﬁeld
components are considered to be positive when they point in the direction of
their respective arrows.3 Note that the s-polarized components are parallel for
all three plane waves, whereas the p-polarized components are not (except at
normal incidence) because each plane wave travels in a different direction.
By inspection of Fig. 3.1, we can write the various wave vectors in terms of the
ˆy and ˆz unit vectors:
ki = ki
¡
ˆysinθi + ˆzcosθi
¢
kr = kr
¡
ˆysinθr −ˆzcosθr
¢
kt = kt
¡
ˆysinθt + ˆzcosθt

(3.1)
Also by inspection of Fig. 3.1 (following the conventions for the electric ﬁelds
indicated by the arrows), we can write the incident, reﬂected, and transmitted
2For example, our convention is different than that used by E. Hecht, Optics, 3rd ed., Sect. 4.6.2
(Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley, 1998).
3Many textbooks draw the arrow for E(p)
r
in the direction opposite of ours. However, that choice
leads to an awkward situation at normal incidence (i.e. θi = θr = 0) where the arrows for the incident
and reﬂected ﬁelds are parallel for the s-component but anti parallel for the p-component.

Each ﬁeld has the form (2.8). We have utilized the k-vectors (3.1) in the exponents
of (3.2).
Figure 3.2 Animation of s- and
p-polarized ﬁelds incident on an
interface as the angle of incidence
is varied.
Now we are ready to connect the ﬁelds on one side of the interface to the
ﬁelds on the other side. This is done using boundary conditions. As explained in
appendix 3.A, Maxwell’s equations require the components of E that are parallel
to the interface to be the same on either side of the boundary. In our coordinate
system, the ˆx and ˆy components are parallel to the interface, whereas z = 0 deﬁnes
the interface. This means that at z = 0 the ˆx and ˆy components of the combined
incident and reﬂected ﬁelds must equal the corresponding components of the
transmitted ﬁeld:

(3.3)
Since this equation must hold for all conceivable values of t and y, we are com-
pelled to set all the phase factors in the complex exponentials equal to each other.
The time portion of the phase factors requires the frequency of all waves to be the
same:
ωi = ωr = ωt ≡ω
(3.4)
(We could have guessed that all frequencies would be the same; otherwise wave
fronts would be annihilated or created at the interface.) Similarly, equating the
spatial terms in the exponents of (3.3) requires
ki sinθi = kr sinθr = kt sinθt
(3.5)
Now recall from (2.19) the relations ki = kr = niω/c and kt = ntω/c. With these
relations, (3.5) yields the law of reﬂection
θr = θi
(3.6)
and Snell’s law
ni sinθi = nt sinθt
(3.7)
The three angles θi, θr, and θt are not independent. The reﬂected angle matches
the incident angle, and the transmitted angle obeys Snell’s law. The phenomenon
of refraction refers to the fact that θi and θt are different. That is, light ‘bends’ as it
transmits through an interface.
Willebrord Snell (or Snellius) (1580
1626, Dutch) was an astronomer and
mathematician born in Leiden, Nether-
lands. In 1613 he succeeded his father
as professor of mathematics at the
University of Leiden. He was an accom-
plished mathematician, developing a
new method for calculating π as well as
an improved method for measuring the
circumference of the earth. He is most
famous for his rediscovery of the law of
refraction in 1621. (The law was known
(in table form) to the ancient Greek
mathematician Ptolemy, to Persian en-
gineer Ibn Sahl (900s), and to Polish
philosopher Witelo (1200s).) Snell au-
thored several books, including one on
trigonometry, published a year after his
death. (Wikipedia)

Chapter 3 Reﬂection and Refraction
Because the exponents are all identical, (3.3) reduces to two relatively simple
equations (one for each dimension, ˆx and ˆy):

(3.8)
and

We have derived these equations from the boundary condition (3.54) on the
parallel component of the electric ﬁeld. This set of equations has four unknowns
(E(p)
r
, E(s)
r , E(p)
t
, and E(s)
t ), assuming that we pick the incident ﬁelds. We require
two additional equations to solve the system. These are obtained using the
separate boundary condition on the parallel component of magnetic ﬁelds given
in (3.58) (also discussed in appendix 3.A).
From Faraday’s law (1.3), we have for a plane wave (see (2.56))
B = k×E
ω
= n
c ˆu×E
(3.10)
where ˆu ≡k/k is a unit vector in the direction of k. We have also utilized (2.19)
for a real index. This expression is useful for writing Bi, Br, and Bt in terms of the
electric ﬁeld components that we have already introduced. When injecting (3.1)
and (3.2) into (3.10), the incident, reﬂected, and transmitted magnetic ﬁelds turn
out to be
Bi = ni

(3.11)
Next, we apply the boundary condition (3.58), namely that the components of B
parallel to the interface (i.e. in the ˆx and ˆy dimensions) are the same4 on either
side of the plane z = 0. Since we already know that the exponents are all equal
and that θr = θi and ni = nr, the boundary condition gives

These two equations together with (3.8) and (3.9) allow us to solve for the reﬂected
Er and transmitted ﬁelds Et for the s and p polarization components. However,
(3.8), (3.9), (3.13), and (3.14) are not yet in their most convenient form.
4We assume the permeability µ0 is the same everywhere—no magnetic effects.

3.2 The Fresnel Coefﬁcients

3.2
The Fresnel Coefﬁcients
Augustin Fresnel ﬁrst derived the equations in the previous section. Since he lived
well before Maxwell’s time, he did not have the beneﬁt of Maxwell’s equations
as we have. Instead, Fresnel thought of light as transverse mechanical waves
propagating within materials. (Fresnel was naturally a proponent of luminiferous
ether.) Instead of relating the parallel components of the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds across the boundary between the materials, Fresnel used the principle that
the two materials should not slip relative to each other at the boundary. This
‘gluing’ of the materials at the interface also forbids the possibility of gaps or the
like forming at the interface as the two materials experience wave vibrations. This
mechanical approach to light worked splendidly, arriving at the same results that
we obtained from our modern viewpoint.
Augustin Fresnel (17881829, French)
was born in Broglie, France, the son of
an architect. As a child, he was slow to
develop and still could not read when
he was eight years old, but by age six-
teen he excelled and entered the École
Polytechnique where he earned distinc-
tion. As a young man, Fresnel began a
successful career as an engineer, but he
lost his post in 1814 when Napoleon re-
turned to power. (Fresnel had supported
the Bourbons.) This dicult year was
when Fresnel turned his attention to
optics. Fresnel became a major propo-
nent of the wave theory of light and
four years later wrote a paper on dirac-
tion for which he was awarded a prize
by the French Academy of Sciences. A
year later he was appointed commis-
sioner of lighthouses, which motivated
the invention of the Fresnel lens (still
used in many commercial applications).
Fresnel was under appreciated before
his untimely death from tuberculosis.
Many of his papers did not make it into
print until years later. Fresnel made
huge advances in the understanding of
reection, diraction, polarization, and
birefringence. In 1824 Fresnel wrote
to Thomas Young, All the compli-
ments that I have received from Arago,
Laplace and Biot never gave me so
much pleasure as the discovery of a
theoretic truth, or the conrmation of
a calculation by experiment. Augustin
Fresnel is a hero of one of the authors
of this textbook. (Wikipedia)
Fresnel wrote the relationships between the various plane waves depicted in
Fig. 3.1 in terms of coefﬁcients that compare the reﬂected and transmitted ﬁeld
amplitudes to those of the incident ﬁeld. In the following example, we illustrate
this procedure for s-polarized light. It is left as a homework exercise to solve the
equations for p-polarized light (see P3.1).
Example 3.1
Calculate the ratio of transmitted ﬁeld to the incident ﬁeld and the ratio of the
reﬂected ﬁeld to incident ﬁeld for s-polarized light.
Solution: We write (3.8) and (3.14) as
E (s)
i +E (s)
r = E (s)
t
and
E(s)
i −E(s)
r = nt cosθt
ni cosθi
E(s)

Adding these two equations yields
2E (s)
i =

1+ nt cosθt

(3.16)
After a little rearrangement we get
E (s)
t
E (s)
i
=
2ni cosθi
ni cosθi +nt cosθt
(3.17)
To get the ratio of reﬂected ﬁeld to incident ﬁeld, we subtract the equations in
(3.15) to get
2E (s)
r =
·
1−nt cosθt
ni cosθi
¸

(3.18)
We divide (3.18) by (3.16), and after simpliﬁcation arrive at

Chapter 3 Reﬂection and Refraction
The ratio of the reﬂected and transmitted ﬁeld components to the incident
ﬁeld components are speciﬁed by the Fresnel coefﬁcients, which are deﬁned as
follows:
rs ≡E(s)
r
E(s)
i
= ni cosθi −nt cosθt
ni cosθi +nt cosθt
= sinθt cosθi −sinθi cosθt

2sinθt cosθi

=
2sinθt cosθi
sin(θt +θi)cos(θt −θi)
(3.23)
All of the above forms of the Fresnel coefﬁcients are potentially useful, depending
on the problem at hand. Remember that the angles in the coefﬁcient are not
independently chosen, but are subject to Snell’s law (3.7). Snell’s law has been
used to produce the alternative expressions from the ﬁrst.

Figure 3.3 The Fresnel coefﬁcients
plotted versus θi for the case of an
air-glass interface with ni = 1 and
nt = 1.5.
The Fresnel coefﬁcients pin down the electric ﬁeld amplitudes on the two
sides of the boundary. They also keep track of phase shifts at a boundary. In
Fig. 3.3 we have plotted the Fresnel coefﬁcients for the case of an air-glass inter-
face. Notice that the reﬂection coefﬁcients are sometimes negative in this plot,
which corresponds to a phase shift of π upon reﬂection (note eiπ = −1). Later we
will see that when absorbing materials are encountered, more complicated phase
shifts can arise due to the complex index of refraction.
3.3
Reﬂectance and Transmittance
We often want to know the fraction of power that reﬂects from or transmits
through an interface. Energy conservation requires the incident power to balance
the reﬂected and transmitted power:
Pi = Pr +Pt
(3.24)
Moreover, the power separates cleanly into power associated with s- and p-
polarized ﬁelds:
P (s)
i = P (s)
r +P (s)
t
and
P
(p)
i
= P
(p)
r +P
(p)
t
(3.25)
Since power is proportional to intensity (i.e. power per area) and intensity
is proportional to the square of the ﬁeld amplitude. We can write the fraction
of reﬂected power, called reﬂectance, in terms of our previously deﬁned Fresnel

There is another more subtle reason for the inequalities in (3.31). Consider
a lateral strip of light associated with a plane wave incident upon the material
interface in Fig. 3.5. Upon refraction into the second medium, the strip is seen
to change its width by the factor cosθt/cosθi. This is a purely geometrical effect,
owing to the change in propagation direction at the interface. Since power is
intensity times area, the transmittance picks up this geometrical factor via the

David Brewster (17811868, Scot-
tish) was born in Jedburgh, Scottland.
His father was a teacher and wanted
David to become a clergyman. At age
twelve, David went to the University of
Edinburgh for that purpose, but his incli-
nation for natural science soon became
apparent. He became licensed to preach,
but his interests in science distracted
him from that profession, and he spent
much of his time studying diraction.
Taking an empirical approach, Brewster
independently discovered many of the
same things usually credited to Fresnel.
He even made a dioptric apparatus for
lighthouses before Fresnel developed
his. Brewster became somewhat fa-
mous in his day for the development
of the kaleidoscope and stereoscope
for enjoyment by the general public.
Brewster was a prolic science writer
and editor throughout his life. Among
his works is an important biography of
Isaac Newton. He was knighted for his
accomplishments in 1831. (Wikipedia)

Notice rp and Rp go to zero at a certain angle in Figs. 3.3 and 3.4, indicating that
no p-polarized light is reﬂected at this angle. This behavior is quite general, as
we can see from the ﬁnal form of the Fresnel coefﬁcient formula for rp in (3.22),
which has tan(θi +θt) in the denominator. Since the tangent ‘blows up’ at π/2,
the reﬂection coefﬁcient goes to zero when
θi +θt = π
2
(requirement for zero p-polarized reﬂection) (3.34)
By inspecting Fig. 3.1, we see that this condition occurs when the reﬂected and
transmitted wave vectors, kr and kt, are perpendicular to each other (see also
Fig. 3.6). If we insert (3.34) into Snell’s law (3.7), we can solve for the incident
angle θi that gives rise to this special circumstance:

Brewster’s angle for reﬂection.
The angle that satisﬁes this equation, in terms of the refractive indices, is
readily found to be
θB = tan−1 nt
ni
(3.36)
We have replaced the speciﬁc θi with θB in honor of Sir David Brewster who ﬁrst
discovered the phenomenon. The angle θB is called Brewster’s angle. At Brewster’s
angle, no p-polarized light reﬂects (see L 3.4). Physically, the p-polarized light
cannot reﬂect because kr and kt are perpendicular. A reﬂection would require
the microscopic dipoles at the surface of the second material to radiate along
their axes, which they cannot do. Maxwell’s equations ‘know’ about this, and so
everything is nicely consistent.
3.5
Total Internal Reﬂection
From Snell’s law (3.7), we can compute the transmitted angle in terms of the
incident angle:
θt = sin−1
µni
nt
sinθi
¶
(3.37)
The angle θt is real only if the argument of the inverse sine is less than or equal to
one. If ni > nt, we can ﬁnd a critical angle beyond which the argument begins to
exceed one:
θc ≡sin−1 nt
ni
(3.38)
When θi > θc, then there is total internal reﬂection and we can directly show that
Rs = 1 and Rp = 1 (see P3.9).5 To demonstrate this, one computes the Fresnel
coefﬁcients (3.20) and (3.22) while employing the following substitution:
cosθt =
q
1−sin2 θt = i
v
u
u
tn2
i
n2
t
sin2 θi −1
(θi > θc) (3.39)
(see P0.19).
In this case, θt is a complex number. However, we do not assign geometrical
signiﬁcance to it in terms of any direction. Actually, we don’t even need to know
the value for θt; we need only the values for sinθt and cosθt, as speciﬁed by
Snell’s law (3.7) and (3.39). Even though sinθt is greater than one and cosθt
is imaginary, we can use their values to compute rs, rp, ts, and tp. (Complex
notation is wonderful!)
Upon substitution of (3.39) into the Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients (3.20) and
(3.22) we obtain
rs =

Each coefﬁcient has a different phase (note ni/nt vs. nt/ni in the expressions),
which means that the s- and p-polarized ﬁelds experience different phase shifts
upon reﬂection. Nevertheless, we deﬁnitely have |rs| = 1 and
¯¯rp
¯¯ = 1. We rightly
conclude that 100% of the light reﬂects. The transmittance is zero as dictated by
(3.30). We emphasize that one should not employ (3.32) or (3.33) in the case of
total internal reﬂection, as the imaginary θt makes the geometric factor in this
equation invalid.

Even with zero transmittance, the boundary conditions from Maxwell’s equa-
tions (as worked out in appendix 3.A) require that the ﬁelds be non-zero on the
transmitted side of the boundary, meaning ts ̸= 0 and tp ̸= 0. While this situation
may seem like a contradiction at ﬁrst, it is an accurate description of what actually
happens. The coefﬁcients ts and tp characterize evanescent waves that exist on
the transmitted side of the interface. The evanescent wave travels parallel to the
interface so that no energy is conveyed away from the interface deeper into the
medium on the transmission side.

Reﬂections from Metal
In this section we generalize our analysis to materials with complex refractive
index N ≡n +iκ. As a reminder, the imaginary part of the index controls atten-
uation of a wave as it propagates within a material. The real part of the index
governs the oscillatory nature of the wave. It turns out that both the imaginary
and real parts of the index strongly inﬂuence the reﬂection of light from a sur-
face. The reader may be grateful that there is no need to re-derive the Fresnel
coefﬁcients (3.20)–(3.23) for the case of complex indices. The coefﬁcients remain
valid whether the index is real or complex – just replace the real index n with the
complex index N . However, we do need to be a bit careful when applying them.

and κ = 4.05. Note the minimum

Brewster’s angle.
We restrict our discussion to reﬂections from a metallic or other absorbing
material surface. As we found in the case of total internal reﬂection, we actually do
not need to know the transmitted angle θt to employ Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients
(3.20) and (3.22). We need only acquire expressions for cosθt and sinθt, and we
can obtain those from Snell’s law (3.7). To minimize complications, we let the
incident refractive index be ni = 1 (which is often the case). Let the index on
the transmitted side be written as Nt = N . Then by Snell’s law, the sine of the
transmitted angle is
sinθt = sinθi
N
(3.45)
This expression is of course complex since N is complex, which is just ﬁne.7 The
cosine of the same angle is
cosθt =
q
1−sin2 θt = 1
N
q
N 2 −sin2 θi
(3.46)
The positive sign in front of the square root is appropriate since it is clearly the
right choice if the imaginary part of the index approaches zero.
Upon substitution of these expressions, the Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients
(3.20) and (3.22) become
rs = cosθi −
p
N 2 −sin2 θi
cosθi +
p
N 2 −sin2 θi

and
rp =

N 2 −sin2 θi −N 2 cosθi

N 2 −sin2 θi +N 2 cosθi
(3.48)
These expressions are tedious to evaluate. When evaluating the expressions, it is
usually desirable to put them into the form
rs = |rs|eiϕs
(3.49)
and
rp =
¯¯rp
¯¯eiϕp

Chapter 3 Reﬂection and Refraction
We refrain from putting (3.47) and (3.48) into this form using the general ex-
pressions; we would get a big mess. It is a good idea to let your calculator or
a computer do it after a speciﬁc value for N ≡n +iκ is chosen. An important
point to notice is that the phases upon reﬂection can be very different for s and
p-polarization components (i.e. ϕp and ϕs can be very different). This is true in
general, even when the reﬂectivity is high (i.e. |rs| and
¯¯rp
¯¯ on the order of unity).
Brewster’s angle exists also for surfaces with complex refractive index. How-
ever, in general the expressions (3.48) and (3.50) do not go to zero at any incident
angle θi. Rather, the reﬂection of p-polarized light can go through a minimum at
some angle θi, which we refer to as Brewster’s angle (see Fig. 3.10). This minimum
is best found numerically since the general expression for
¯¯rp
¯¯ in terms of n and κ
and as a function of θi can be unwieldy.

Boundary Conditions For Fields at an Inter-
face
We are interested in the continuity of ﬁelds across a boundary from one medium
with index n1 to another medium with index n2. We will show that the compo-
nents of electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the interface surface must
be the same on either side (adjacent to the interface). This result is independent
of the refractive index of the materials; in the case of the magnetic ﬁeld we assume
the permeability µ0 is the same on both sides. To derive the boundary conditions,
we consider a surface S (a rectangle) that is perpendicular to the interface between
the two media and which extends into both media, as depicted in Fig. 3.11.

in the material with index n1 which is perpendicular to the interface. Similarly,
E 2|| and E2⊥are the parallel and perpendicular components of the electric ﬁeld
in the material with index n2. We have assumed that the rectangle is small enough
that the ﬁelds are uniform within the half rectangle on either side of the boundary.
Next, we shrink the loop down until it has zero surface area by letting the
lengths ℓ1 and ℓ2 go to zero. In this situation, the right-hand side of Faraday’s law
(3.51) goes to zero

This simple relation is a general boundary condition, which is met at any material
interface. The component of the electric ﬁeld that lies in the plane of the interface
must be the same on both sides of the interface.

The notation for parallel and perpendicular components on either side of the

Chapter 4
Multiple Parallel Interfaces
In chapter 3, we studied the transmission and reﬂection of light at a single in-
terface between two (isotropic homogeneous) materials with indices ni and nt.
We found that the percent of light reﬂected versus transmitted depends on the
incident angle and on whether the light is s- or p-polarized. The Fresnel coef-
ﬁcients rs, ts, rp, tp (3.20)–(3.23) connect the reﬂected and transmitted ﬁelds to
the incident ﬁeld. Similarly, either Rs and Ts or Rp and Tp determine the fraction
of incident power that either reﬂects or transmits (see (3.26) and (3.30)).
In this chapter we consider the overall transmission and reﬂection through
multiple parallel interfaces. We start with a two-interface system, where a layer of
material is inserted between the initial and ﬁnal materials. This situation occurs
frequently in optics. For example, lenses are often coated with a thin layer of
material in an effort to reduce reﬂections. Metal mirrors usually have a thin oxide
layer or a protective coating between the metal and the air. We can develop
reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients r tot and ttot, which apply to the overall
double-boundary system, similar to the Fresnel coefﬁcients for a single boundary.
Likewise, we can compute an overall reﬂectance and transmittance Rtot and T tot.
These can be used to compute the ‘tunneling’ of evanescent waves across a gap
between two parallel surfaces when the critical angle for total internal reﬂection
is exceeded.
The formalism we develop for the double-boundary problem is useful for
describing a simple instrument called a Fabry-Perot etalon (or interferometer if
the instrument has the capability of variable spacing between the two surfaces).
Such an instrument, which is constructed from two partially reﬂective parallel
surfaces, is useful for distinguishing closely spaced wavelengths.
Finally, in this chapter we will extend our analysis to multilayer coatings,
where an arbitrary number of interfaces exist between many material layers.
Multilayers are often used to make highly reﬂective mirror coatings from dielectric
materials (as opposed to metallic materials). Such mirror coatings can reﬂect
with efﬁciencies greater than 99.9% at speciﬁed wavelengths. In contrast, metallic
mirrors typically reﬂect with ∼96% efﬁciency, which can be a signiﬁcant loss
if there are many mirrors in an optical system. Dielectric multilayer coatings

also have the advantage of being more durable and less prone to damage from

Double-Interface Problem Solved Using Fresnel Coef-
ﬁcients
Consider a slab of material sandwiched between two other materials as depicted
in Fig. 4.1. Because there are multiple reﬂections inside the middle layer, we have
dropped the subscripts i, r, and t used in chapter 3 and instead use the symbols
 and   to indicate forward and backward traveling waves, respectively. Let n1
stand for the refractive index of the middle layer. For consistency with notation
that we will later use for many-layer systems, let n0 and n2 represent the indices
of the other two regions. For simplicity, we assume that indices are real. As with
the single-boundary problem, we are interested in ﬁnding the overall transmitted

ing both forward and backward between the two surfaces. It might therefore seem
that we need to keep track of an inﬁnite number of plane waves, each correspond-
ing to a different number of bounces. Fortunately, the many forward-traveling
plane waves all travel in the same direction. Similarly, the backward-traveling
plane waves are all parallel. These plane-wave ﬁelds then join neatly into a single
net forward-moving and a single net backward-moving plane wave within the

To solve for the connections between the ﬁve ﬁelds depicted in Fig.4.1, we
will need four equations for either s or p polarization (taking the incident ﬁeld as
a given). To simplify things, we will consider s-polarized light in the upcoming
analysis. The equations for p-polarized light look exactly the same; just replace
the subscript s with p. Through the remainder of this section and the next, we
will continue to economize by writing the equations only for s-polarized light
with the understanding that they apply equally well to p-polarized light.

The forward-traveling wave in the middle region arises from both a transmis-
sion of the incident wave and a reﬂection of the backward-traveling wave in the
middle region at the ﬁrst interface. Using the Fresnel coefﬁcients, we can write

Before we continue, we need to specify an origin so that we can calculate
phase shifts associated with propagation in the middle region. Propagation was
not an issue in the single-boundary problem studied back in chapter 3. However,
in the double-boundary problem, the thickness of the middle region dictates
phase variations that strongly inﬂuence the result. We take the origin to be
located on the ﬁrst interface, as shown in Fig. 4.1. Since all ﬁelds in (4.4) and (4.5)
are evaluated at the origin (y,z) = (0,0), there were no phase factors needed.
We will connect the plane-wave ﬁelds across the second interface at the point
r = ˆzd. The appropriate phase-adjusted2 ﬁeld at (y,z) = (0,d) is E

1eik1·r =
E

1eik1d cosθ1, since E

region, and at our selected point it is

Note that E

2 stand for the transmitted ﬁeld at the point (y,z) = (0,d); its local
phase can be built into its deﬁnition so no need to write an explicit phase.
The backward-traveling plane wave in the middle region arises from the
reﬂection of the forward-traveling plane wave in that region:

The relations (4.4)–(4.7) permit us to ﬁnd overall transmission and reﬂection
coefﬁcients for the two-interface problem.

The coefﬁcient ttot

derived in Example 4.1 connects the amplitude and phase
of the incident ﬁeld to the amplitude and phase of the transmitted ﬁeld in a
manner similar to the single-boundary Fresnel coefﬁcients. The numerator of
(4.11) reminds us of the physics of the situation: the ﬁeld transmits through the
ﬁrst interface, acquires a phase due to propagating through the middle layer, and
transmits through the second interface. The denominator of (4.11) modiﬁes the
result to account for feedback from multiple reﬂections in the middle region.3

The initial reﬂection from the ﬁrst interface is described by the ﬁrst term r 01

The numerator in (4.12) can be simpliﬁed algebraically, but we have left it in
this longer form to emphasize the physics of the situation. The numerator of
the second term describes the effect of light that transmits through the ﬁrst
interface, propagates through the middle layer, reﬂects from the second interface,
propagates back through the middle layer, and transmits back through the ﬁrst
interface to interfere with the initial reﬂection. The denominator of the second
term accounts for the effects of multiple-reﬂection feedback.

phase shift of π). While this coating reduces the overall reﬂection as compared
to an uncoated optic, note that it does not eliminate the reﬂection because the
two interfering plane waves have different amplitudes. Figure 4.3 shows the
phase of the overall reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients, written in the form

Transmittance through Double-Interface at Sub Criti-
cal Angles
We are now in a position to calculate the fraction of power that transmits through
or reﬂects from a double-interface arrangement. Because the transmission coefﬁ-
cient (4.11) has a simpler form than the reﬂection coefﬁcient (4.12), it is easier to
calculate the total transmittance T tot

and obtain the reﬂectance, if desired, from
the relationship (see (3.30))

Note that we multiplied the numerator and denominator of (4.11) by e−ik1d cosθ1
before inserting it into (4.14), which make the denominator more symmetric for
later convenience.
When θ1 is also real (i.e. θ0 also does not exceed the critical angle), we can

4.2 Transmittance through Double-Interface at Sub Critical Angles
93
The quantity T max
s
is the maximum possible transmittance of power through the
two surfaces. The single-interface transmittances (T 01
s
and T 12
s
) and reﬂectances
(R10
s
and R12
s
) are calculated from the single-interface Fresnel coefﬁcients in
the usual way as described in chapter 3. The numerator of T max
s
represents the
combined transmittances for the two interfaces without considering feedback
due to multiple reﬂections. The denominator enhances this value to account for
reinforcing feedback in the middle layer.
The exact argument of the sine function, Φs, can strongly inﬂuence the trans-
mission. The term 2k1d cosθ1 represents the phase delay acquired during round-
trip propagation in the middle region. The terms ϕr 10
s
and ϕr 12
s
account for
possible phase shifts upon reﬂection from each interface. They are deﬁned in-
directly by writing the single-boundary Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients in polar
format:
r

If the indices of refraction in all regions are real, ϕr 10
s
and ϕr 12
s
take on values of
either zero or π (i.e. the coefﬁcients are positive or negative real numbers). When
the indices are complex, other phase values are possible.
Fs is called the coefﬁcient of ﬁnesse, which determines how strongly the trans-
mittance is inﬂuenced when Φs is varied (for example, through varying d or the
wavelength λvac).

Example 4.2
Consider a ‘beam splitter’ designed for s-polarized light incident on a substrate of
glass (n = 1.5) at 45◦as shown in Fig. 4.4. A thin coating of zinc sulﬁde (n = 2.32)
is applied to the front of the glass to cause about half of the light to reﬂect. A
magnesium ﬂuoride (n = 1.38) coating is applied to the back surface of the glass to
minimize reﬂections at that surface.5 Each coating constitutes a separate double-
interface problem. The front coating is deferred to problem P4.5. In this example,
ﬁnd the highest transmittance possible through the antireﬂection ﬁlm at the back
of the ‘beam splitter’ and the smallest possible ˜d that accomplishes this for light
with wavelength λvac = 633 nm.
Solution: For the back coating, we have n0 = 1.5, n1 = 1.38, and n2 = 1. We can
ﬁnd θ0 and θ1 from θ2 = 45◦using Snell’s law
n1 sinθ1 = sinθ2

θ1 = sin−1

5We ignore possible feedback between the front and rear coatings. Since the antireﬂection
ﬁlms are usually imperfect, beam splitter substrates are often slightly wedged so that unwanted
reﬂections from the second surface travel in a different direction.

Chapter 4 Multiple Parallel Interfaces
Next we calculate the single-boundary Fresnel coefﬁcients:
r 12
s
= −sin(θ1 −θ2)
sin(θ1 +θ2) = −sin(30.82◦−45◦)
sin(30.82◦+45◦) = 0.253
r 10
s
= −sin(θ1 −θ0)
sin(θ1 +θ0) = −sin(30.82◦−28.13◦)
sin(30.82◦+28.13◦) = −0.0549

The maximum transmittance occurs when the sine is zero. In that case, T tot

we can recover by temporarily setting ˜d = 0, the transmittance would be 90.8%, so
the coating gives a signiﬁcant improvement.
We ﬁnd the smallest thickness ˜d that minimizes reﬂection by setting the argument
of the sine to π:

Beyond Critical Angle: Tunneling of Evanescent Waves
Figure 4.5 Animation showing
frustrated total internal reﬂection.
If n1 < n0, it is possible for θ0 to exceed the critical angle at the ﬁrst interface.
In this case, (4.15) cannot be used to calculate transmittance. However, (4.14)
still holds as long as the angle θ2 is real (i.e. if the critical angle in the absence of
the middle layer is not exceeded). In this case an evanescent wave occurs in the
middle region, but not in the last region. If the second interface is sufﬁciently
close to the ﬁrst, the evanescent wave stimulates the second surface to produce a
transmitted wave propagating at angle θ2 in the last region. This behavior called
tunneling or frustrated total internal reﬂection, can be modeled using (4.14) .
We do not need to deal directly with the complex angle θ1. Rather, we just need
sinθ1 and cosθ1 in order to calculate the single-boundary Fresnel coefﬁcients.
From Snell’s law we have
sinθ1 = n0

Calculate the transmittance of p-polarized light through the region between two

the prism spacing d. Take the index of refraction of the prisms to be n = 1.5
surrounded by index n = 1, and use θ0 = θ2 = 45◦. Neglect possible reﬂections
from the exterior surfaces of the prisms.

Figure 4.7 shows a plot of the transmittance (4.22) calculated in Example 4.3.
Notice that the transmittance is 100% when the two prisms are brought together as
expected. That is, T tot
p (d = 0) = 1. When the prisms are about a wavelength apart,
the transmittance is signiﬁcantly reduced, and as the distance gets large compared
to a wavelength, the transmittance quickly goes to zero (T tot
p (d/λvac ≫1) ≈0).

Fabry-Perot Instrument
Maurice Paul Auguste Charles Fabry
(1867-1945, French) was born in Mar-
seille, France. At age 18, he entered the
École Polytechnique in Paris where he
studied for two years. Following that, he
spent a number of years teaching state
secondary school while simultaneously
working on a doctoral dissertation on
interference phenomona. After com-
pleting his doctorate, he began working
as a lecturer and laboratory assistant
at the University of Marseille where a
decade later he was appointed a pro-
fessor of physics. Soon after his arrival
to the University of Marseille, Fabry
began a long and fruitful collaboration
with Alfred Perot (1863-1925). Fabry
focused on theoretical analysis and mea-
surements while his colleague did the
design work and construction of their
new interferometer, which they continu-
ally improved over the years. During his
career, Fabry made signicant contribu-
tions to spectroscopy and astrophysics
and is credited with co-discovery of the
ozone layer. See J. F. Mulligan, Who
were Fabry and Perot?, Am. J. Phys.
66. 797-802 (1998).
In the 1890s, Charles Fabry realized that a double interface could be used to
distinguish wavelengths of light that are very close together. He and a talented
experimentalist colleague, Alfred Perot, constructed an instrument and began
to use it to make measurements on various spectral sources. The Fabry-Perot
instrument6 consists of two identical (parallel) surfaces separated by spacing d.
We can use our analysis in section 4.2 to describe this instrument. For simplicity,
we choose the refractive index before the initial surface and after the ﬁnal surface
to be the same (i.e. n0 = n2). We assume that the transmission angles are such
that total internal reﬂection is avoided. The transmission through the device
depends on the exact spacing between the two surfaces, the reﬂectance of the
surfaces, as well as on the wavelength of the light.

4.4 Fabry-Perot Instrument

If the spacing d separating the two parallel surfaces is adjustable, the instru-
ment is called a Fabry-Perot interferometer. If the spacing is ﬁxed while the angle
of the incident light is varied, the instrument is called a Fabry-Perot etalon. An
etalon can therefore be as simple as a piece of glass with parallel surfaces. Some-
times, a thin optical membrane called a pellicle is used as an etalon (occasionally
inserted into laser cavities to discriminate against certain wavelengths). However,
to achieve sharp discrimination between closely-spaced wavelengths, a relatively
large spacing d is desirable.
Jean-Baptiste Alfred Perot (1863-
1925, French) was born in Metz, France.
He attended the Ecole Polytechnique
and then the University of Paris, where
he earned a doctorate in 1888. He be-
came a professor in in Marseille in 1894
where he began his collaboration with
Fabry. Perot contributed his consider-
able talent of instrument fabrication to
the endeavor. Perot spent much of his
later career making precision astronom-
ical and solar measurements. See J. F.
Mulligan, Who were Fabry and Perot?,
Am. J. Phys. 66. 797-802 (1998).
As we previously derived (4.15), the transmittance through a double boundary
is
T tot =
T max
1+F sin2 ¡ Φ
2
¢
(4.23)
In the case of identical interfaces, the transmittance and reﬂectance coefﬁcients
are the same at each surface (i.e. T = T 01 = T 12 and R = R10 = R12). In this
case, the maximum transmittance and the ﬁnesse coefﬁcient simplify to
T max =
T 2
(1−R)2
(4.24)
and
F =
4R
(1−R)2
(4.25)
In principle, these equations should be evaluated for either s- or p-polarized light.
However, a Fabry-Perot interferometer or etalon is usually operated near normal
incidence so that there is little difference between the two polarizations.
When using a Fabry-Perot instrument, one observes the transmittance T tot as
the parameter Φ is varied. The parameter Φ can be varied by altering d, θ1, or λ
as prescribed by
Φ = 4πn1d
λvac
cosθ1 +2ϕr
(4.26)
To increase the sensitivity of the instrument, it is desirable to have the transmit-
tance T tot vary strongly as a function of Φ. By inspection of (4.23), we see that this
happens if the ﬁnesse coefﬁcient F is large. We achieve a large ﬁnesse coefﬁcient
by increasing the reﬂectance R.

setup. If the spacing d is variable,
it is called an interferometer; oth-
erwise, it is called an etalon.
The basic Fabry-Perot instrument design is shown in Fig. 4.8. In order to
achieve high reﬂectivity R (and therefore large F), special coatings can be applied
to the surfaces, for example, a thin layer of silver to achieve reﬂectance of, say,
90%. Typically, two glass substrates are separated by distance d, with the coated
surfaces facing each other as shown in the ﬁgure. The substrates are aligned so
that the interior surfaces are parallel to each other. It is typical for each substrate
to be slightly wedge-shaped so that unwanted reﬂections from the outer surfaces
do not interfere with the double boundary situation between the two plates.
Technically, each coating constitutes its own double-boundary problem (or
multiple-boundary as the case may be). We can ignore this detail and simply
think of the overall setup as a single two-interface problem. Regardless of the

98
Chapter 4 Multiple Parallel Interfaces
details of the coatings, we can say that each coating has a certain reﬂectance R
and transmittance T . However, as light goes through a coating, it can also be
attenuated because of absorption. In this case, we have
R +T + A = 1
(4.27)
where A represents the amount of light absorbed at a coating. The attenuation A
reduces the amount of light that makes it through the instrument, but it does not
impact the nature of the interferences within the instrument.

Figure 4.9 Transmittance as the
phase Φ is varied. The different
curves correspond to different
values of the ﬁnesse coefﬁcient.
The total transmittance T tot (4.23) through an ideal Fabry-Perot instrument is
depicted in Fig. 4.9 as a function of Φ. The various curves correspond to different
values of F. Typical values of Φ can be extremely large. For example, suppose
that the instrument is used at near-normal incidence (i.e. cosθ1 ∼= 1) with a
wavelength of λvac = 500 nm and an interface separation of d = 1 cm. From (4.26)
the value of Φ (ignoring the phase term 2ϕr ) is approximately
Φ = 4π(1 cm)
500 nm = 80,000π
As we vary d, λ, or θ1 by small amounts, we can easily cause Φ to change by 2π as
depicted in Fig. 4.9. The ﬁgure shows small changes in Φ in the neighborhood of
very large multiples of 2π.
The phase term 2ϕr in (4.26) depends on the exact nature of the coatings
in the Fabry-Perot instrument. However, we do not need to know the value
of ϕr, which may depend on both the complex index of the coating material
and its thickness. Whatever the value of ϕr, we only care that it is constant.
Experimentally, we can always compensate for the ϕr by ‘tweaking’ the spacing
d, whose exact value is likely not controlled for in the ﬁrst place. Note that the
required ‘tweak’ on the spacing need only be a fraction of a wavelength, which is
typically tiny compared to the overall spacing d.

Figure 4.10 shows the typical experimental setup for a Fabry-Perot interferometer.
A collimated beam of light is sent through the instrument. The beam is aligned so
that it is normal to the surfaces. It is critical for the two surfaces of the interferom-
eter to be extremely close to parallel. When aligned correctly, the transmission
of a collimated beam will ‘blink’ all together as the spacing d is changed (by tiny
amounts). A mechanical actuator can be used to vary the spacing between the
plates while the transmittance is observed on a detector. To make the alignment
of the instrument somewhat less critical, a small aperture can be placed in front
of the detector so that it observes only a small portion of the beam.

Figure 4.11 Transmittance as the
separation d is varied (F = 100).
The transmittance as a function of plate separation is shown in Fig. 4.11. In
this case, Φ varies via changes in d (see (4.26) with cosθ1 = 1 and ﬁxed wave-
length). As the spacing is increased by only a half wavelength, the transmittance

changes through a complete period. The various peaks in the ﬁgure are called
fringes.
The setup for a Fabry-Perot etalon is similar to that of the interferometer
except that the spacing d remains ﬁxed. Often the two surfaces in the etalon are
held parallel to each other by a precision spacer. An advantage to the Fabry-Perot
etalon (as opposed to the interferometer) is that no moving parts are needed. To
make measurements with an etalon, the angle of the light is varied rather than the
plate separation. After all, to see fringes, we just need to cause Φ in (4.23) to vary
in some way. According to (4.26), we can do that as easily by varying θ1 as we can
by varying d. One way to obtain a range of angles is to observe light from a ‘point
source’, as depicted in Fig. 4.12. Different portions of the beam go through the
device at different angles. When aligned straight on, the transmitted light forms a
‘bull’s-eye’ pattern on a screen.

In Fig. 4.13 we graph the transmittance T tot (4.23) as a function of angle
(holding λvac = 500 nm and d = 1 cm ﬁxed). Since cosθ1 is not a linear function,
the spacing of the peaks varies with angle. As θ1 increases from zero, the cosine
steadily decreases, causing Φ to decrease. Each time Φ decreases by 2π we get a
new peak. Not surprisingly, only a modest change in angle is necessary to cause
the transmittance to vary from maximum to minimum, or vice versa.

is assumed that the distance d is
chosen such that Φ is a multiple of
2π when the angle is zero.
The bull’s-eye pattern in Fig. 4.12 can be understood as the curve in Fig. 4.13
rotated about a circle. Depending on the exact spacing between the plates, the
angles where the fringes occur can be different. For example, the center spot
could be dark.
Spectroscopic samples often are not compact point-like sources. Rather, they
are extended diffuse sources. The point-source setup shown in Fig. 4.12 won’t
work for extended sources unless all of the light at the sample is blocked except
for a tiny point. This is impractical if there remains insufﬁcient illumination at
the ﬁnal screen for observation.
In order to preserve as much light as possible, we can sandwich the etalon
between two lenses. We place the diffuse source at the focal plane of the ﬁrst lens.
We place the screen at the focal plane of the second lens. This causes an image of
the source to appear on the screen.7 Each point of the diffuse source is mapped
to a corresponding point on the screen. Moreover, the light associated with any
particular point of the source travels as a unique collimated beam in the region
between the lenses. Each collimated beam traverses the etalon with a speciﬁc
angle. Thus, light associated with each emission point traverses the etalon with
higher or lower transmittance, according to the differing angles. The result is that
a bull’s eye pattern becomes superimposed on the image of the diffuse source.
The lens and retina of your eye can be used for the ﬁnal lens and screen.

Distinguishing Nearby Wavelengths in a Fabry-Perot
Instrument
Thus far, we have examined how the transmittance through a Fabry-Perot instru-
ment varies with surface separation d and angle θ1. However, the main purpose
of a Fabry-Perot instrument is to measure small changes in the wavelength of
light, which similarly affect the value of Φ (see (4.26)).8
Consider a Fabry-perot interferometer where the transmittance through the
instrument is plotted as a function of plate spacing d. At certain spacings, Φ
happens to be a multiple of 2π for the wavelength λvac. Next, suppose we adjust
the wavelength to λvac + ∆λ while observing the locations of these fringes. As
the wavelength changes, the locations at which Φ is a multiple of 2π change.
Consequently, the fringes shift as seen in ﬁgure 4.15.
Transmittance
0
Figure 4.15 Transmittance as the
spacing d is varied for two dif-
ferent wavelengths (F = 100).
The solid line plots the transmit-
tance of light with a wavelength
of λvac, and the dashed line plots
the transmittance of a wavelength
shorter than λvac. Note that the
fringes shift positions for different
wavelengths.
We now derive the connection between a change in wavelength and the
amount that Φ changes, which gives rise to the fringe shift seen in Fig. 4.15. At
the wavelength λvac +∆λ (all else remaining the same), (4.26) shifts to
Φ−∆Φ = 4πn1d cosθ1
λvac +∆λ
+2ϕr
(4.28)
The change in wavelength ∆λ is usually very small compared to λvac, so we can
represent the denominator with a truncated Taylor-series expansion:
1
λvac +∆λ =
1
λvac (1+∆λ/λvac)
∼= 1−∆λ/λvac
λvac
(4.29)
The amount that Φ changes is then seen to be
∆Φ = 4πn1d cosθ1
λ2
vac
∆λ
(4.30)
If the change in wavelength is enough to cause ∆Φ = 2π, the fringes in Fig. 4.15
shift through a whole period, and the picture looks the same.
This brings up an important limitation of the instrument. If the fringes shift
by too much, we might become confused as to what exactly has changed, owing
to the periodic nature of the fringes. If two wavelengths aren’t sufﬁciently close,
the fringes of one wavelength may be shifted past several fringes of the other
wavelength, and we will not be able to tell by how much they differ.
This introduces the concept of free spectral range, which is the wavelength
change ∆λFSR that causes the fringes to shift through one period. We ﬁnd this by
setting (4.30) equal to 2π. After rearranging, we get
∆λFSR =
λ2
vac
2n1d cosθ1
(4.31)
The free spectral range tends to be extremely narrow; a Fabry-Perot instrument is
not well suited for measuring wavelength ranges wider than this. In summary, the

free spectral range is the largest change in wavelength permissible while avoiding
confusion. To convert this wavelength difference ∆λFSR into a corresponding
frequency difference, one differentiates ν = c/λvac to get
|∆νFSR| = c∆λFSR

Example 4.4
A Fabry-Perot interferometer has plate spacing d = 1 cm and index n1 = 1. If it
is used in the neighborhood of λvac = 500 nm, ﬁnd the free spectral range of the
instrument.
Solution: From (4.31), the free spectral range is
∆λFSR =
λ2
vac
2n1d0 cosθ1
= ∆λFSR =
(500 nm)2
2(1)(1 cm)cos0◦= 0.0125 nm
This means that we should not use the instrument to distinguish wavelengths that
are separated by more than this small amount.
We next consider the smallest change in wavelength that can be noticed,
or resolved with a Fabry-Perot instrument. For example, if two very near-by
wavelengths are sent through the instrument simultaneously, we can distinguish
them only if the separation between their corresponding fringe peaks is at least
as large as the width of an individual peak. This situation of two barely resolvable
fringe peaks is illustrated in Fig. 4.16 for a diverging beam traversing an etalon.
We will look for the wavelength change that causes a peak to shift by its own
width. We deﬁne the width of a peak by its full width at half maximum (FWHM).
Again, let Φ be a multiple of 2π where a peak in transmittance occurs. In this case,
we have from (4.23) that
T tot =
T max
1+F sin2 ¡ Φ
2
¢ = T max
(4.33)
since sin(Φ/2) = 0. When Φ shifts to a neighboring value Φ±ΦFWHM/2, then, by
deﬁnition, the transmittance drops to one half. Therefore, we may write
T tot =
T max
1+F sin2 ³
Φ0±ΦFWHM/2
2
´ = T max

(4.34)
In solving for (4.34) for ΦFWHM, we see that this equation requires
F sin2
µΦFWHM

(4.35)
where we have taken advantage of the fact that Φ is assumed to be a multiple of
2π. Next, we suppose that ΦFWHM/4 is rather small so that we may represent the

sine by its argument. This approximation is okay if the ﬁnesse coefﬁcient F is
rather large (say, 100). With this approximation, (4.35) simpliﬁes to
ΦFWHM ∼=

This parameter is often used to characterize the performance of a Fabry-Perot

is the same ratio f . Therefore, we have

As a ﬁnal note, the ratio of λvac to ∆λFWHM, where ∆λFWHM is the minimum
change of wavelength that the instrument can distinguish in the neighborhood of
λvac is called the resolving power:
RP ≡
λvac
∆λFWHM
(4.39)
Fabry-Perot instruments tend to have very high resolving powers as the following
example illustrates.
Example 4.5
If the Fabry-Perot interferometer in Example 4.4 has reﬂectivity R = 0.85, ﬁnd the
ﬁnesse, the minimum distinguishable wavelength separation, and the resolving
power.
Solution: From (4.25), the ﬁnesse coefﬁcient is
F =

The instrument can distinguish two wavelengths separated by this tiny amount,
which gives an impressive resolving power of

0.00065 nm = 772,000
For comparison, the resolving power of a typical grating spectrometer is much less
(a few thousand). However, a grating spectrometer has the advantage that it can
simultaneously observe wavelengths over hundreds of nanometers, whereas the
Fabry-Perot instrument is conﬁned to the extremely narrow free spectral range.
4.7
Multilayer Coatings
As we saw in Example 4.2, a single coating cannot always accomplish a desired
effect, especially if the goal is to make a highly reﬂective mirror. For example, if
we want to make a mirror surface using a dielectric (i.e. nonmetallic) coating,
a single layer is insufﬁcient to reﬂect the majority of the light. In P4.5 we ﬁnd
that a single dielectric layer deposited on glass can reﬂect at most about 46%
of the light, even when we used a material with very high index. We would like
to do much better (e.g. >99%), and this can be accomplished with multilayer
dielectric coatings. Multilayer dielectric coatings can perform considerably better
than metal surfaces such as silver and have the advantage of being less prone to
damage.
In this section, we develop the formalism for dealing with arbitrary numbers
of parallel interfaces (i.e. multilayer coatings).9 Rather than incorporate the single-
interface Fresnel coefﬁcients into the problem as we did in section 4.1, we will
ﬁnd it easier to return to the fundamental boundary conditions for the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds at each interface between the layers.
We examine p-polarized light incident on an arbitrary multilayer coating
with all interfaces parallel to each other. It is left as an exercise to re-derive the
formalism for s-polarized light (see P4.13). The upcoming derivation is valid
also for complex refractive indices, although our notation suggests real indices.
The ability to deal with complex indices is very important if, for example, we
want to make mirror coatings work in the extreme ultraviolet wavelength range
where virtually every material is absorptive. Consider the diagram of a multilayer
coating in Fig. 4.17 for which the angle of light propagation in each region may be
computed from Snell’s law:
n0 sinθ0 = n1 sinθ1 = ··· = nN sinθN = nN+1 sinθN+1
(4.41)
where N denotes the number of layers in the coating. The subscript 0 represents
the initial medium outside of the multilayer, and the subscript N +1 represents
the ﬁnal material, or the substrate on which the layers are deposited.

we must proceed with care, or the algebra can quickly get out of hand. Fortunately,
you have probably had training in linear algebra, and this is a case where that
training pays off.

Periodic Multilayer Stacks
Many different types of multilayer coatings are possible. For example, a Brewster’s-
angle polarizer has a coating designed to transmit with high efﬁciency p-polarized
light while simultaneously reﬂecting s-polarized light with high efﬁciency. The
backside of the substrate is left uncoated where p-polarized light passes with
100% efﬁciency at Brewster’s angle.

structure with alternating high
and low indexes where each layer
is a quarter wavelength in thick-
ness. This structure can achieve
very high reﬂectance.
Sometimes multilayer coatings are made with repeated stacks of layers. In
general, if the same series of layers in (4.68) is repeated many times, say q times,

This formula relies on the condition AD −BC = 1, which is true for matrices of
the form (4.55) and (4.63) or any product of them. Here, A, B, C, and D represent
the elements of a matrix composed of a block of matrices corresponding to a
repeated pattern within the stack.
In general, high-reﬂection coatings are designed with alternating high and
low refractive indices. For high reﬂectivity, each layer should have a quarter-
wave thickness. Since the layers alternate high and low indices, at every other

108

boundary there is a phase shift of π upon reﬂection from the interface. Hence,
the quarter wavelength spacing is appropriate to give constructive interference in
the reﬂected direction.

Chapter 5
Propagation in Anisotropic Media
To this point, we have considered only isotropic media where the susceptibility
χ(ω) (and hence the index of refraction) is the same for all propagation directions
and polarizations. In anisotropic materials, such as crystals, it is possible for
light to experience a different index of refraction depending on the alignment of
the electric ﬁeld E (i.e. polarization). This difference in the index of refraction
occurs when the direction and strength of the induced dipoles depends on the
lattice structure of the material in addition to the propagating ﬁeld.1 The unique
properties of anisotropic materials make them important elements in many
optical systems.
In section 5.1 we discuss how to connect E and P in anisotropic media using a
susceptibility tensor. In section 5.2 we apply Maxwell’s equations to a plane wave
traveling in a crystal. The analysis leads to Fresnel’s equation, which relates the
components of the k-vector to the components of the susceptibility tensor. In
section 5.3 we apply Fresnel’s equation to a uniaxial crystal (e.g. quartz, sapphire)
where χx = χy ̸= χz. In the context of a uniaxial crystal, we show that the Poynting
vector and the k-vector are generally not parallel.
More than a century before Fresnel, Christian Huygens successfully described
birefringence in crystals using the idea of elliptical wavelets. His method gives
the direction of the Poynting vector associated with the extraordinary ray in a
crystal. It was Huygens who coined the term ‘extraordinary’ since one of the
rays in a birefringent material appeared not to obey Snell’s law. Actually, the
k-vector always obeys Snell’s law, but in a crystal, the k-vector points in a different
direction than the Poynting vector, which delivers the energy seen by an observer.
Huygens’ approach is outlined in Appendix 5.D.
5.1
Constitutive Relation in Crystals
In a anisotropic crystal, asymmetries in the lattice can cause the medium polar-
ization P to respond in a different direction than the electric ﬁeld E (i.e. P ̸= ϵ0χE).
1Not all crystals are anisotropic. For instance, crystals with a cubic lattice structure (such as
NaCl) are highly symmetric and respond to electric ﬁelds the same in any direction.

Chapter 5 Propagation in Anisotropic Media
However, at low intensities the response of materials is still linear (or propor-
tional) to the strength of the electric ﬁeld. The linear constitutive relation which
connects P to E in a crystal can be expressed in its most general form as

The matrix in (5.1) is called the susceptibility tensor. To visualize the behavior

electron bound in a crystal lat-
tice with the coordinate system
specially chosen along the princi-
pal axes so that the susceptibility
tensor takes on a simple form.
of electrons in such a material, we imagine each electron bound as though by
tiny springs with different strengths in different dimensions to represent the
anisotropy (see Fig. 5.1). When an external electric ﬁeld is applied, the electron
experiences a force that moves it from its equilibrium position. The ‘springs’
(actually the electric force from ions bound in the crystal lattice) exert a restoring
force, but the restoring force is not equal in all directions—the electron tends to
move more along the dimension of the weaker spring. The displaced electron
creates a microscopic dipole, but the asymmetric restoring force causes P to be in
a direction different than E as depicted in Fig. 5.2.
To understand the geometrical interpretation of the many coefﬁcients χi j,
assume, for example, that the electric ﬁeld is directed along the x-axis (i.e. Ey =
Ez = 0) as depicted in Fig. 5.2. In this case, the three equations encapsulated in
(5.1) reduce to
Px = ϵ0χxxEx
Py = ϵ0χyxEx
Pz = ϵ0χzxEx
Notice that the coefﬁcient χxx connects the strength of P in the ˆx direction with
the strength of E in that same direction, just as in the isotropic case. The other two
coefﬁcients (χyx and χzx) describe the amount of polarization P produced in the
ˆy and ˆz directions by the electric ﬁeld component in the x-dimension. Likewise,
the other coefﬁcients with mixed subscripts in (5.1) describe the contribution to
P in one dimension made by an electric ﬁeld component in another dimension.
Figure 5.2 The applied ﬁeld E
and the induced polarization P in
general are not parallel in a crystal
lattice.
As you might imagine, working with nine susceptibility coefﬁcients can get
complicated. Fortunately, we can greatly reduce the complexity of the description
by a judicious choice of coordinate system. In Appendix 5.A we explain how
conservation of energy requires that the susceptibility tensor (5.1) for typical
non-aborbing crystals be real and symmetric (i.e. χi j = χji).2
Appendix 5.B shows that, given a real symmetric tensor, it is always possible
to choose a coordinate system for which off-diagonal elements vanish. This is
true even if the lattice planes in the crystal are not mutually orthogonal (e.g.
rhombus, hexagonal, etc.). We will imagine that this rotation of coordinates
2By ‘typical’ we mean that the crystal does not exhibit optical activity. Optically active crystals
have a complex susceptibility tensor, even when no absorption takes place. Conservation of energy
in this more general case requires that the susceptibility tensor be Hermitian (χi j = χ∗
ji ).

has been accomplished. In other words, we can let the crystal itself dictate the
orientation of the coordinate system, aligned to the principal axes of the crystal
for which the off-diagonal elements of (5.1) are zero
With the coordinate system aligned to the principal axes, the constitutive
relation for a non absorbing crystal simpliﬁes to

By assumption, χx, χy, and χz are all real. (We have dropped the double subscript;
χx stands for χxx, etc.)
5.2
Plane Wave Propagation in Crystals
We consider a plane wave with frequency ω propagating in a crystal. In a manner
similar to our previous analysis of plane waves propagating in isotropic materials,
we write as trial solutions
E = E0ei(k·r−ωt)
B = B0ei(k·r−ωt)
P = P0ei(k·r−ωt)
(5.4)
where restrictions on E0, B0, P0, and k are yet to be determined. As usual, the
phase of each wave is included in the amplitudes E0, B0, and P0, whereas k is real
in accordance with our assumption of no absorption.
We can make a quick observation about the behavior of these ﬁelds by apply-
ing Maxwell’s equations directly. Gauss’s law for electric ﬁelds requires
∇·(ϵ0E+P) = k·(ϵ0E+P) = 0
(5.5)
and Gauss’s law for magnetism gives
∇·B = k·B = 0
(5.6)
We immediately notice the following peculiarity: From its deﬁnition, the Poynting
vector S ≡E×B/µ0 is perpendicular to both E and B, and by (5.6) the k-vector is
perpendicular to B. However, by (5.5) the k-vector is not necessarily perpendicu-
lar to E, since in general k·E ̸= 0 if P points in a direction other than E. Therefore,
k and S are not necessarily parallel in a crystal. In other words, the ﬂow of energy
and the direction of the phase-front propagation can be different in anisotropic
media.

124
Chapter 5 Propagation in Anisotropic Media
Our main goal here is to relate the k-vector to the susceptibility parameters χx,
χy, and χz. To do this, we plug our trial plane-wave ﬁelds into the wave equation
(1.40). Under the assumption Jfree = 0, we have
∇2E−µ0ϵ0

∂t2 = µ0

Derivation of the dispersion relation in crystals
We begin by substituting the trial solutions (5.4) into the wave equation (5.7). After
carrying out the derivatives we ﬁnd
k2E−ω2µ0 (ϵ0E+P) = k(k·E)
(5.8)

This relationship is unwieldy because of the mix of electric ﬁeld components that
appear in the expression. This was not a problem when we investigated isotropic
materials for which the k-vector is perpendicular to E, making the right-hand side
of the equations zero. However, there is a trick for dealing with this.
Relation (5.9) actually contains three equations, one for each dimension. Explicitly,
these equations are

We have replaced the constants µ0ϵ0 with 1/c2 in accordance with (1.42). We
multiply (5.10)–(5.12) respectively by kx, ky, and kz and also move the factor in
square brackets in each equation to the denominator on the right-hand side. Then
by adding the three equations together we get

The dispersion relation (5.14) allows us to ﬁnd a suitable k, given values for ω,
χx, χy, and χz. Actually, it only restricts the magnitude of k; we must still decide
on a direction for the wave to travel (i.e. we must choose the ratios between kx, ky,
and kz). To remind ourselves of this fact, we introduce a unit vector that points in
the direction of k

We may deﬁne refractive index as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum

introduced for isotropic media (i.e. (2.19) for real index) remains appropriate.
That is
n = kc
ω
(5.17)
This familiar relationship between k and ω, in the case of a crystal, depends on
the direction of propagation in accordance with (5.16).

parameters:

Chapter 5 Propagation in Anisotropic Media
The upper and lower signs (+ and −) in (5.20) give two positive solutions for n2.
The positive square root of these solutions yields two physical values for n. It turns
out that each of the two values for n is associated with a polarization direction
of the electric ﬁeld, given a propagation direction k. A broader analysis carried
out in appendix 5.C renders the orientation of the electric ﬁelds, whereas here we
only show how to ﬁnd the two values of n. We refer to the two indices as the slow
and fast index, since the waves associated with each propagate at speed v = c/n.
In the special cases of propagation along one of the principal axes of the
crystal, the index n takes on two of the values nx, ny, or nz, depending on which
are orthogonal to the direction of propagation.

Calculate the two possible values for the index of refraction when k is in the ˆz

Inserting this expression into (5.20), we ﬁnd the two values for the index:

The index nx is experienced by light whose electric ﬁeld points in the x-dimension,
and the index ny is experienced by light whose electric ﬁeld points in the y-
dimension (see appendix 5.C ).
Figure 5.3 Spherical coordinates.
Before moving on, let us brieﬂy summarize what has been accomplished so
far. Given values for χx, χy, and χz associated with light in a crystal at a given
frequency, you can deﬁne the indices nx, ny, and nz, according to (5.18). Next, a
direction for the k-vector is chosen (i.e. ux, uy, and uz). This direction generally
has two values for the index of refraction associated with it, found using Fresnel’s
equation (5.20). Each index is associated with a speciﬁc polarization direction
for the electric ﬁeld as outlined in appendix 5.C. Every propagation direction ˆu
has its own natural set of polarization components for the electric ﬁeld. The two
polarization components travel at different speeds, even though the frequency is
the same. This is known as birefringence.

and nz = 2.41) .
All anisotropic crystals have certain special propagation directions where the two
values for n from Fresnel’s equation are equal. These directions are referred to as
the optic axes of the crystal. The optic axes do not necessarily coincide with the
principal axes ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz. When propagation is along an optic axis, all polarization
components experience the same index of refraction. If the values of nx, ny, and
nz are all unique, a crystal will have two optic axes, and hence is referred to as a
biaxial crystal.
It is often convenient to use spherical coordinates to represent the compo-
nents of ˆu (see to Fig. 5.3):
ux = sinθcosφ
uy = sinθsinφ
uz = cosθ
(5.24)
Here θ is the polar angle measured from the z-axis of the crystal and φ is the
azimuthal angle measured from the x-axis of the crystal. These equations em-
phasize the fact that there are only two degrees of freedom when specifying
propagation direction (θ and φ). It is important to remember that these angles
must be speciﬁed in the frame of the crystal’s principal axes, which are often not
aligned with the faces of a cut crystal in an optical setup.
By convention, we order the crystal axes for biaxial crystals so that nx < ny <
nz. Under this convention, the two optic axes occur in the x-z plane (φ = 0) at
two values of the polar angle θ, measured from the z-axis (see P5.3):

(Optic axes directions, biaxial crystal) (5.25)
While ﬁnding the direction of the optic axes in a biaxial crystal is straight forward,
obtaining an expression for the associated indices of refraction is messy. The
smaller value is commonly referred to as the ‘fast’ index and the larger value
the ‘slow’ index. Figure 5.4 shows the two refractive indices (i.e. the solutions
to Fresnel’s equation (5.20)) for a biaxial crystal plotted with color shading on
the surface of a sphere. Each point on the sphere represents a different θ and φ.
The two optic axes are apparent in the plot of the difference between nslow and
nfast; the two indices coincide when propagation is along either optic axis. When
propagating in these directions, either polarization experiences the same index.
For the remainder of this chapter, we will focus on the simpler case of uniaxial
crystals.
In uniaxial crystals two of the coefﬁcients χx, χy, and χz are the same. In
this case, there is only one optic axis for the crystal (hence the name uniaxial).
By convention, in uniaxial crystals we label the dimension that has the unique
susceptibility as the z-axis (i.e. χx = χy ̸= χz). This makes the z-axis the optic axis.
The unique index of refraction is called the extraordinary index
nz = ne
(5.26)

128
Chapter 5 Propagation in Anisotropic Media
and the other index is called the ordinary index
nx = ny = no
(5.27)
These names were coined by Huygens, one of the early scientists to study light
in crystals (see appendix 5.D). A uniaxial crystal with ne > no is referred to as a
positive crystal, and one with ne < no is referred to as a negative crystal.

their difference) as a function of

(BBO) at λ = 500 nm (no = 1.68
and ne = 1.56).
To calculate the index of refraction for a wave propagating in a uniaxial crystal,
we use deﬁnitions (5.26) and (5.27) along with the spherical representation of ˆu
(5.24) in Fresnel’s equation (5.20) to ﬁnd the following two values for n (see P5.4):
n = no
(uniaxial crystal) (5.28)
and
n = ne(θ) ≡
none
q
n2
o sin2 θ +n2
e cos2 θ
(uniaxial crystal) (5.29)
The index ne(θ) in (5.29) is commonly referred to as the extraordinary index, in
addition to the constant ne = nz. While this has the potential for some confusion,
the practice is so common that we will perpetuate it here. We will write ne(θ)
when the angle dependent quantity speciﬁed by (5.29) is required, and write ne in
formulas where the constant (5.26) is called for (as in the right-hand side of (5.29)).
Notice that ne(θ) depends only on θ (the polar angle measured from the optic axis
ˆz) and not φ (the azimuthal angle). Figure 5.5 shows the two refractive indices
(5.28) and (5.29) as a function θ and φ. Since ne(θ) has no φ dependence and no
is constant, the variation with direction is much simpler than for the biaxial case.
As outlined in appendix 5.C, the index no corresponds to an electric ﬁeld
component that points perpendicular to the plane containing ˆu and ˆz (e.g. if
ˆu is in the x-z plane, no is associated with light polarized in the y-dimension).
On the other hand, the index ne(θ) corresponds to ﬁeld polarization that lies
within the plane containing ˆu and ˆz. In this case, the polarization component
is directed partially along the optic axis (i.e. it has a z-component). That is why
(5.29) gives for the refractive index a mixture of no and ne. If θ = 0, then the
k-vector is directed exactly along the optic axis, and ne(θ) reduces to no so that
both polarization components experience same index no.
5.4
Refraction at a Uniaxial Crystal Surface
Next we consider refraction as light enters a uniaxial crystal. Snell’s law (3.7)
describes the connection between the k-vectors incident upon and transmitted
through the surface. We must consider separately the portion of the light that
experiences the ordinary index and the portion that experiences the extraordinary
index. Because of the different indices, the ordinary and extraordinary polarized
light refract into the crystal at two different angles; they travel at two different
velocities in the crystal; and they have two different wavelengths in the crystal.

5.5 Poynting Vector in a Uniaxial Crystal
129
If we assume that the index outside of the crystal is one, Snell’s law for the
ordinary polarization is
sinθi = no sinθt
(ordinary polarized light) (5.30)
where no is the ordinary index inside the crystal. The extraordinary polarized
light also obeys Snell’s law, but now the index of refraction in the crystal depends
on direction of propagation inside the crystal relative to the optic axis. Snell’s law
for the extraordinary polarization is
sinθi = ne(θ′)sinθt
(extraordinary polarized light) (5.31)
where θ′ is the angle between the optic axis inside the crystal and the direction of
propagation in the crystal (given by θt in the plane of incidence). When the optic
axis is at an arbitrary angle with respect to the surface the relationship between
θ′ and θt is cumbersome. We will examine Snell’s law only for the speciﬁc case
when the optic axis is perpendicular to the crystal surface, for which θt = θ′.

Example 5.2
Examine Snell’s law for a uniaxial crystal with optic axis perpendicular to the
surface.
Solution: Refer to Fig. 5.6. With the optic axis perpendicular to the surface, if the
light hits the crystal surface straight on, the index of refraction is no, regardless
of the orientation of polarization since θ′ = θt = 0. When the light strikes the
surface at an angle, s-polarized light continues to experience the index no, while
p-polarized light experiences the extraordinary index ne(θt). 3
When we insert (5.29) into Snell’s law (5.31) with θ′ = θt, the expression can be
inverted to ﬁnd the transmitted angle θt in terms of θi (see P5.5):

Poynting Vector in a Uniaxial Crystal
When an object is observed through a crystal (acting as a window), the energy
associated with ordinary and extraordinary polarized light follow different paths,
3The correspondence between s and p and ordinary and extraordinary polarization components
is speciﬁc to the orientation of the optic axis in this example. For arbitrary orientations of the
optic axis with respect to the surface, the ordinary and extraordinary components will generally be
mixtures of s and p polarized light.

giving rise to two different images. This phenomenon is one of the more com-
monly observed manifestations of birefringence. Since the Poynting vector dic-
tates the direction of energy ﬂow, it is the direction of S that determines the
separation of the double image seen when looking through a birefringent crystal.
Snell’s law dictates the connection between the directions of the incident
and transmitted k-vectors. The Poynting vector S for purely ordinary polarized
light points in the same direction as the k-vector, so the direction of energy ﬂow
for ordinary polarized light also obeys Snell’s law. However, for extraordinary
polarized light, the Poynting vector S is not parallel to k (recall the discussion in
connection with (5.5) and (5.6)). Thus, the energy ﬂow associated with extraor-
dinary polarized light does not obey Snell’s law. When Christiaan Huygens saw
this in the 1600s, one can imagine him exclaiming “how extraordinary!” Huygens’
method for describing the phenomenon is outlined appendix 5.D.
To analyze extraordinary polarized light, we would like to develop an expres-
sion analogous to Snell’s law, but which applies to S rather than to k. This then
describes the direction that the energy associated with extraordinary rays takes
upon entering the crystal. First, k inside the crystal is found from Snell’s law (5.31).
In general, the electric ﬁeld E may be obtained from (5.62) and then the magnetic
ﬁeld via B = (k×E)/ω, to evaluate S = E×B/µ0. In general, this process is best
done numerically, since Snell’s law (5.31) for extraordinary polarized light usually
does not have simple analytic solutions.
Example 5.3
Find a relationship between direction of the Poynting Vector in a uniaxial crystal
and the angle of incidence in the special case where the optic axis is perpendicular
to the surface.
Solution: To ﬁnd the direction of energy ﬂow, we must calculate S = E×B/µ0. We
will need to know E associated with ne(θ). We can obtain E from the procedures
outlined in appendix 5.C. Equivalently, we can obtain it from the constitutive
relation (5.3) with the deﬁnitions (5.18):

Let the k-vector lie in the y-z plane. We may write it as k = k

Then the ordinary component of the ﬁeld points in the x-direction, while the
extraordinary component lies in the y-z plane.

p-polarized portions of the incident light can each give rise to both extraordinary
and ordinary rays.
Appendix 5.A
Symmetry of Susceptibility Tensor
Here we show that the assumption of a non-absorbing (and non optically active)
medium implies that the susceptibility tensor is symmetric. We assume that P is
due to a single species of electron, so that we have P = Np. Here N is the number

electron and re is the microscopic displacement of the electron. The force on this
electron due to the electric ﬁeld is given by F = Eqe. With these deﬁnitions, we
can use (5.1) to write a connection between the force due to a static E and the

(5.44)
While there are many possible paths for getting the electron to any speciﬁc dis-
placement (each path speciﬁed by a different history of the electric ﬁeld), the
work done along any of these paths must be the same if the system is conservative
(i.e. no absorption). For example, if the ﬁnal displacement of r = xeˆx + yeˆy we
could have the following two paths:
(0,0,0)
(0,0,0)
Path 1
Path 2
We can use (5.42) in (5.44) to calculate the total work done on the electron
4This inversion assumes the ﬁeld changes slowly so the forces on the electron are always es-
sentially balanced. This is not true for optical ﬁelds, but the proof gives the right ﬂavor for why
conservation of energy results in the symmetry. A more formal proof that doesn’t make this as-
sumption can be found in Principles of Optics, 7th Ed., Born and Wolf, pp. 790-791.

Since the work must be the same for these two paths, we clearly have kxy = kyx.
Similar arguments for other pairs of dimensions ensure that the matrix of k
coefﬁcients is symmetric. From linear algebra, we learn that if the inverse of a
matrix is symmetric then the matrix itself is also symmetric. When we combine
this result with the deﬁnition (5.43), we see that the assumption of no absorption
requires the susceptibility matrix to be symmetric.
Appendix 5.B
Rotation of Coordinates
In this appendix, we go through the labor of showing that (5.1) can always be
written as (5.3) via rotations of the coordinate system, given that the susceptibility

ﬁnally a rotation through an angle α about the new x-axis, can be written as

We have expressly indicated that the off-diagonal terms of χ′ are symmetric (i.e.

consequence of χ being symmetric and R−1 being equal to RT
The three off-diagonal elements of χ′ (appearing both above and below the
diagonal) are found by performing the matrix multiplication in the second line
of (5.55). The speciﬁc expressions for these three elements are not particularly
enlightening. The important point is that we can make all three of them equal to
zero since we have three degrees of freedom in the angles α, β, and γ. Although,
we do not expressly solve for the angles, we have demonstrated that it is always
possible to set

For (5.58) to have a non-trivial solution (i.e. non zero ﬁelds), the determinant
of the matrix must be zero. Imposing this requirement is an equivalent way to
derive Fresnel’s equation (5.19) for n.
Given a direction for ˆu and a value for n (from Fresnel’s equation), we can use
(5.58) to determine the direction of the electric ﬁeld associated with that index.
It is left as an exercise to show that when all three components are nonzero (i.e.
ux ̸= 0, uy ̸= 0, and uz ̸= 0), the appropriate ﬁeld direction for a value of n is given
by

This is a proportionality rather than an equation because Maxwell’s equations
only specify the direction of E—we are free to choose the amplitude. Because
Fresnel’s equation gives two values for n, (5.59) speciﬁes two distinct polarization
components associated with each propagation direction ˆu. These polarization
components form a natural basis for describing light propagation in a crystal.
When light is composed of a mixture of these two polarizations, the two polariza-
tion components experience different indices of refraction.
If any of the components of ˆu (i.e. ux, uy, or uz) is precisely zero, the corre-
sponding entry in (5.59) yields a zero-over-zero situation. This happens when at
least one of the dimensions in (5.58) becomes decoupled from the others. In these
cases, one can re-solve (5.58) for the polarization directions as in the following
example.
Example 5.4
Determine the directions of the two polarization components associated with light
propagating in the ˆu = ˆz direction. (Compare with Example 5.1.)
Solution: In this case we have ux = uy = 0, so as noted above, we have to go back
to (5.58) and re-solve. The set of equations becomes

Notice that all three dimensions are decoupled in this system (i.e. there are no
off-diagonal terms). In Example 5.1 we found that the two values of n associated
with ˆu = ˆz are nx and ny. If we use n = nx in our set of equations, we have

Assuming nx and ny are unique so that ny/nx ̸= 1, these equations require Ey =
Ez = 0 but allow Ex to be non-zero. This proves our earlier assertion that the index
nx is associated with light polarized in the x-dimension in the special case of ˆu = ˆz.
Similarly, when ny is inserted into (5.60), we ﬁnd that it is associated with light
polarized in the y-dimension.

two polarization components.
We can use (5.59) to study the behavior of polarization direction as the direc-
tion of propagation varies. Figure 5.7 shows plots of the polarization direction (i.e.
normalized Ex, Ey, and Ez) in Potassium Niobate as the propagation direction
is varied. The plot is created by inserting the spherical representation of ˆu (5.24)
into Fresnel’s equation (5.20) for a chosen sign of the ±, and then inserting the re-
sulting n into (5.59) to ﬁnd the associated electric ﬁeld. As we saw in Example 5.4,
at θ = 0 the light associated with the slow index is polarized along the y-axis and
the light associated with the fast index is polarized along the x-axis.
In Fig. 5.7(c) we have plotted the angle between the two polarization com-
ponents. At θ = 0, the two polarization components are 90◦apart, as you might
expect. However, notice that in other propagation directions the two linear polar-
ization components are not precisely perpendicular. Even so, the two polarization
components of E are orthogonal in a mathematical sense,6 so that they still com-
prise a useful basis for decomposing the light ﬁeld.
Determining the Fields in a Uniaxial Crystal.
To ﬁnd the directions of the electric ﬁeld for light that experiences the ordinary
index of refraction in a uniaxial crystal, we insert n = no into the requirement
(5.58), and solve for the allowed ﬁelds (see P5.9) to ﬁnd

This ﬁeld component is associated with the ordinary wave. Just as in an isotropic
medium such as glass, the index of refraction for light with this polarization does
not vary with θ. The polarization component associated with ne(θ) is found by

Notice that this polarization component is partially directed along the optic axis
(i.e. it has a z-component), and it is not perpendicular to k since ˆu·Ee(ˆu) ̸= 0 (see
P5.10). It is, however, perpendicular to the ordinary polarization component, since
Ee ·Eo = 0.
Notice that when θ = 0, (5.29) reduces to n = no so that both indices are the same.
On the other hand, if θ = π/2 then (5.29) reduces to n = ne. These limits must be
approached carefully in (5.62).
Appendix 5.D
Huygens’ Elliptical Construct for a Uniaxial
Crystal
In 1690 Christian Huygens developed a way to predict the direction of extraordi-
nary rays in a crystal by examining an elliptical wavelet. The point on the elliptical
wavelet that propagates along the optic axis is assumed to experience the index
ne. The point on the elliptical wavlet that propagates perpendicular to the optic
axis is assumed to experience the index no. It turns out that Huygens’ approach
agreed with the direction energy propagation (5.40) (as opposed to the direction
of the k-vector). This was quite satisfactory in Huygens’ day (except that he was
largely ignored for a century, owing to Newton’s corpuscular theory) since the
direction of energy propagation is what an observer sees.

Figure 5.8 Elliptical wavelet.
Consider a plane wave entering a uniaxial crystal with the optic axis perpen-
dicular to the surface. In Huygens’ point of view, each point on a wave front acts
as a wavelet source which combines with neighboring wavelets to preserve the
overall plane wave pattern. Inside the crystal, the wavelets propagate in the shape
of an ellipse. The equation for an elliptical wave front after propagating during a
time t is

In order to have the wavelet joint neatly with other wavelets to build a plane wave,
the wave front of the ellipse must be parallel to a new wave front entering the sur-
face at a distance ct/sinθi above the original point. This distance is represented

Chapter 6
Polarization of Light
When the direction of the electric ﬁeld of light oscillates in a regular, predictable
fashion, we say that the light is polarized. Polarization describes the direction
of the oscillating electric ﬁeld, a distinct concept from dipoles per volume in a
material P – also called polarization. In this chapter, we develop a formalism
for describing polarized light and the effect of devices that modify polarization.
If the electric ﬁeld oscillates in a plane, we say that it is linearly polarized. The
electric ﬁeld can also spiral around while a plane wave propagates, and this is
called circular or elliptical polarization. There is a convenient way for keeping
track of polarization using a two-dimensional Jones vector.
Figure 6.1 Animation showing
different polarization states of
light.
Many devices can affect polarization such as polarizers and wave plates. Their
effects on a light ﬁeld can be represented by 2×2 Jones matrices that operate on
the Jones vector representing the light. A Jones matrix can describe, for example,
a polarizer oriented at an arbitrary angle or it can characterize the inﬂuence of
a wave plate, which is a device that introduces a relative phase between two
components of the electric ﬁeld.
In this chapter, we will also see how reﬂection and transmission at a material
interface inﬂuences ﬁeld polarization. As we saw previously, s-polarized light
can acquire a phase lag or phase advance relative to p-polarized light. This is
especially true at metal surfaces, which have complex indices of refraction. The
Fresnel coefﬁcients studied in chapters 3 and 4 can be conveniently incorporated
into a Jones matrix to keep track of their inﬂuence polarization. Ellipsometry,
outlined in appendix 6.A, is the science of characterizing optical properties of
materials through an examination of these effects.
Throughout this chapter, we consider light to have well characterized polar-
ization. However, most common sources of light (e.g. sunlight or a light bulb)
have an electric-ﬁeld direction that varies rapidly and randomly. Such sources
are commonly referred to as unpolarized. It is common to have a mixture of
unpolarized and polarized light, called partially polarized light. The Jones vector
formalism used in this chapter is inappropriate for describing the unpolarized
portions of the light. In appendix 6.B we describe a more general formalism for
dealing with light having an arbitrary degree of polarization.

Chapter 6 Polarization of Light
6.1
Linear, Circular, and Elliptical Polarization
Consider the plane-wave solution to Maxwell’s equations given by
E(r,t) = E0ei(k·r−ωt)
(6.1)
The wave vector k speciﬁes the direction of propagation. We neglect absorption
so that the refractive index is real and k = nω/c = 2πn/λvac (see (2.19)–(2.24)). In
an isotropic medium we know that k and E0 are perpendicular, but even after the
direction of k is speciﬁed, we are still free to have E0 point anywhere in the two
dimensions perpendicular to k. If we orient our coordinate system with the z-axis
in the direction of k, we can write (6.1) as
E(z,t) =
¡
Ex ˆx+Ey ˆy
¢
ei(kz−ωt)
(6.2)
As always, only the real part of (6.2) is physically relevant. The complex amplitudes
of Ex and Ey keep track of the phase of the oscillating ﬁeld components. In
general the complex phases of Ex and Ey can differ, so that the wave in one of the
dimensions lags or leads the wave in the other dimension.
The relationship between Ex and Ey describes the polarization of the light.
For example, if Ey is zero, the plane wave is said to be linearly polarized along the
x-dimension. Linearly polarized light can have any orientation in the x–y plane,
and it occurs whenever Ex and Ey have the same complex phase (or a phase
differing by π). For our purposes, we will take the x-dimension to be horizontal
and the y-dimension to be vertical unless otherwise noted.

two orthogonally polarized plane
waves that are out of phase results

we have left circularly polarized
light created as speciﬁed by (6.3).
As an example, suppose Ey = iEx, where Ex is real. The y-component of the
ﬁeld is then out of phase with the x-component by the factor i = eiπ/2. Taking the
real part of the ﬁeld (6.2) we get

(left circular) (6.3)
In this example, the ﬁeld in the y-dimension lags behind the ﬁeld in the x-
dimension by a quarter cycle. That is, the behavior seen in the x-dimension
happens in the y-dimension a quarter cycle later. The ﬁeld never goes to zero
simultaneously in both dimensions. In fact, in this example the strength of the
electric ﬁeld is constant, and it rotates in a circular pattern in the x-y dimensions.
For this reason, this type of ﬁeld is called circularly polarized. Figure 6.2 graph-
ically shows the two linear polarized pieces in (6.3) adding to make circularly
polarized light.
If we view a circularly polarized light ﬁeld throughout space at a frozen instant
in time (as in Fig. 6.2), the electric ﬁeld vector spirals as we move along the z-
dimension. If the sense of the spiral (with time frozen) matches that of a common
wood screw oriented along the z-axis, the polarization is called right handed. (It
makes no difference whether the screw is ﬂipped end for end.) If instead the ﬁeld

6.2 Jones Vectors for Representing Polarization
145
spirals in the opposite sense, then the polarization is called left handed. The ﬁeld
shown in Fig. 6.2 is an example of left-handed circularly polarized light.
An equivalent way to view the handedness convention is to imagine the light
impinging on a screen as a function of time. The ﬁeld of a right-handed circularly
polarized wave rotates counter clockwise at the screen, when looking along the k
direction (towards the front side of the screen). The ﬁeld rotates clockwise for a
left-handed circularly polarized wave.
Linearly polarized light can become circularly or, in general, elliptically po-
larized after reﬂection from a metal surface if the incident light has both s- and
p-polarized components. A good experimentalist working with light needs to
know this. Reﬂections from multilayer dielectric mirrors can also exhibit these
phase shifts.

Jones Vectors for Representing Polarization
R. Clark Jones (19162004, American)
was born in Toledo Ohio. He was one
of six high school seniors to receive a
Harvard College National Prize Fellow-
ship. He earned both his undergraduate
(summa cum laude 1938) and Ph.D.
degrees from Harvard (1941). After
working several years at Bell Labs, he
spent most of his professional career
at Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge
MA, until his retirement in 1982. He
is well-known for a series of papers on
polarization published during the period
1941-1956. He also contributed greatly
to the development of infrared detectors.
He was an avid train enthusiast, and
even wrote papers on railway engineer-
ing. See J. Opt. Soc. Am. 63, 519-522
(1972). Also see SPIE oemagazine,
p. 52 (Aug. 2004).
In 1941, R. Clark Jones introduced a two-dimensional matrix algebra that is useful
for keeping track of light polarization and the effects of optical elements that
inﬂuence polarization.1 The algebra deals with light having a deﬁnite polarization,
such as plane waves. It does not apply to un-polarized or partially polarized light
(e.g. sunlight). For partially polarized light, a four-dimensional algebra known as
Stokes calculus is used (see Appendix 6.B).
In preparation for introducing Jones vectors, we explicitly write the complex
phases of the ﬁeld components in (6.2) as
E(z,t) =
³
|Ex|eiφx ˆx+|Ey|eiφy ˆy
´
ei(kz−ωt)
(6.4)
and then factor (6.4) as follows:
E(z,t) = Eeff

other hand, if Ex happens to be zero, then its phase eiφx is indeterminant. In this
case we let Eeff = |Ey|eiφy, B = 1, and δ = 0.
The overall ﬁeld strength Eeff is often unimportant in a discussion of polariza-
tion. It represents the strength of an effective linearly polarized ﬁeld that would
correspond to the same intensity as (6.4). Speciﬁcally, from (2.62) and (6.5) we
have
I = 〈S〉t = 1
2ncϵ0E·E∗= 1
2ncϵ0 |Eeff|2
(6.10)
The phase of Eeff represents an overall phase shift that one can trivially adjust by
physically moving the light source (a laser, say) forward or backward by a fraction
of a wavelength.

Table 6.1 Jones Vectors for several
common polarization states.
The portion of (6.5) that is relevant to our discussion of polarization is the
vector Aˆx+Beiδˆy, referred to as the Jones vector. This vector contains the essential
information regarding ﬁeld polarization. Notice that the Jones vector is a kind
of unit vector, in that (Aˆx+Beiδˆy) ·(Aˆx+Beiδˆy)∗= 1. (The asterisk represents
the complex conjugate.) When writing a Jones vector we dispense with the ˆx and
ˆy notation and organize the components into a column vector (for later use in
matrix algebra) as follows:
·
A
Beiδ
¸
(6.11)
This vector can describe the polarization state of any plane wave ﬁeld. Table 6.1
lists some Jones vectors representing various polarization states.
6.3
Elliptically Polarized Light
In general, the Jones vector (6.11) represents a polarization state between linear
and circular. This ‘between’ state is known as elliptically polarized light. As
the wave travels, the ﬁeld vector makes a spiral motion. If we observe the ﬁeld
vector at a point as the ﬁeld goes by, the ﬁeld vector traces out an ellipse oriented
perpendicular to the direction of travel (i.e. in the x–y plane). One of the axes of
the ellipse occurs at the angle
α = 1
2 tan−1
µ2AB cosδ

¶
(6.12)
with respect to the x-axis (see P6.8). This angle sometimes corresponds to the
minor axis and sometimes to the major axis of the ellipse, depending on the exact
values of A, B, and δ. The other axis of the ellipse (major or minor) then occurs at
α±π/2 (see Fig. 6.3).
We can deduce whether (6.12) corresponds to the major or minor axis of the
ellipse by comparing the strength of the electric ﬁeld when it spirals through the
direction speciﬁed by α and when it spirals through α±π/2. The strength of the
electric ﬁeld at α is given by (see P6.8)
Eα = |Eeff|

(α±π/2) is given by
Eα±π/2 = |Eeff|
p
A2 sin2 α+B2 cos2 α−AB cosδsin2α
(Emax or Emin) (6.14)
After computing (6.13) and (6.14), we decide which represents Emin and which
Emax according to
Emax ≥Emin
(6.15)
We could predict in advance which of (6.13) or (6.14) corresponds to the major
axis and which corresponds to the minor axis. However, making this prediction is
as complicated as simply evaluating (6.13) and (6.14) and determining which is
greater.
  
  
Figure 6.3 The electric ﬁeld of el-
liptically polarized light traces an
ellipse in the plane perpendicular
to its propagation direction. The
two plots are for different values
of A, B, and δ. The angle α can de-
scribe the major axis (top) or the
minor axis (bottom), depending
on the values of these parameters.
Elliptically polarized light is often characterized by the ellipticity, given by the
ratio of the minor axis to the major axis:
e ≡Emin
Emax
(6.16)
The ellipticity e ranges between zero (corresponding to linearly polarized light)
and one (corresponding to circularly polarized light). Finally, the helicity or
handedness of elliptically polarized light is as follows (see P6.2):
0 < δ < π
→
left-handed helicity

π < δ < 2π

Linear Polarizers and Jones Matrices
In 1928, Edwin Land invented an inexpensive polarizing device. He did it by
stretching a polymer sheet and infusing it with iodine. The stretching caused the
polymer chains to align along a common direction, whereupon the sheet was
cemented to a substrate. The infusion of iodine caused the individual chains to
become conductive, like microscopic wires.
When light impinges upon Land’s Polaroid sheet, the component of electric
ﬁeld that is parallel to the polymer chains causes a current Jfree to oscillate in
that dimension. The resistance to the current quickly dissipates the energy (i.e.
the refractive index is complex) and the light is absorbed. The thickness of the
Polaroid sheet is chosen sufﬁciently large to ensure that virtually none of the light
with electric ﬁeld component oscillating along the chains makes it through the
device.
The component of electric ﬁeld that is orthogonal to the polymer chains
encounters electrons that are essentially bound to the narrow width of individual
polymer molecules. For this polarization component, the wave passes through
the material much like it does through typical dielectrics such as glass (i.e. the
refractive index is real). Today, there is a wide variety of technologies for making
polarizers, many very different from Polaroid.

148
Chapter 6 Polarization of Light
A polarizer can be represented as a 2×2 matrix that operates on Jones vec-
tors.2 The function of a polarizer is to pass only the component of electric ﬁeld
that is oriented along the polarizer transmission axis. If a polarizer is oriented
with its transmission axis along the x-dimension, only the x-component of po-
larization transmits; the y-component is killed. If the polarizer is oriented with
its transmission axis along the y-dimension, only the y-component of the ﬁeld
transmits, and the x-component is killed. These two scenarios can be represented
with the following Jones matrices:
· 1

0
¸
(polarizer with transmission along x-axis) (6.19)
· 0
0
0
1
¸
(polarizer with transmission along y-axis) (6.20)
These matrices operate on any Jones vector representing the polarization of
incident light. The result gives the Jones vector for the light exiting the polarizer.

Use the Jones matrix (6.19) to calculate the effect of a horizontal polarizer on
light that is initially horizontally polarized, vertically polarized, and arbitrarily
polarized.

While you might readily agree that the matrices given in (6.19) and (6.20)
can be used to get the right result for light traversing a horizontal or a vertical
polarizer, you probably aren’t very impressed as of yet. In the next few sections,
we will derive Jones matrices for a number of optical elements that can modify
polarization: polarizers at arbitrary angle, wave plates at arbitrary angle, and
reﬂection or transmissions at an interface. Table 6.2 shows Jones matrices for
each of these devices. Before deriving these speciﬁc Jones matrices, however, we
take a moment to appreciate why the Jones matrix formulation is useful.

The real power of the formalism becomes clear as we consider situations
where light encounters multiple polarization elements in sequence. In these situ-
ations, we use a product of Jones matrices to represent the effect of the compound
systems. We can represent this situation by
· A′
B′
¸

·

(6.21)
where the unprimed Jones vector represents light going into the system and the
primed Jones vector represents light emerging from the system.
The matrix Jsystem is a Jones matrix formed by a series of polarization devices.
If there are N devices in the system, the compound matrix is calculated as
Jsystem ≡JNJN−1 ···J2J1
(6.22)
where Jn is the matrix for the nth polarizing optical element encountered in the
system. Notice that the matrices operate on the Jones vector in the order that
the light encounters the devices. Therefore, the matrix for the ﬁrst device (J1) is
written on the right, and so on until the last device encountered, which is written
on the left, farthest from the Jones vector.
When part of the light is absorbed by passing through one or more polarizers
in a system, the Jones vector of the exiting light does not necessarily remain
normalized to magnitude one (see Example 6.1). The factor by which the intensity
of the light decreases is given by

vector and write it in standard form as follows:

In this section we develop a Jones matrix for describing an ideal polarizer with
its transmission axis at an arbitrary angle θ from the x-axis. We will do this in a
general context so that we can take advantage of the present work when discussing
wave plates in the next section. To help keep things on a more conceptual level,
we revert back to using electric ﬁeld components directly. We will make the
connection with Jones calculus at the end.
The polarizer acts on a plane wave with arbitrary polarization. The electric
ﬁeld of our plane wave may be written as
E(z,t) =
¡
Ex ˆx+Ey ˆy
¢
ei(kz−ωt)
(6.24)
Let the transmission axis of the polarizer be speciﬁed by the unit vector ˆe1
and the absorption axis of the polarizer be speciﬁed by ˆe2 (orthogonal to the
transmission axis). The vector ˆe1 is oriented at an angle θ from the x-axis, as
shown in Fig. 6.6. We need to write the electric ﬁeld components in terms of the
new basis speciﬁed by ˆe1 and ˆe2. By inspection of the geometry, the x-y unit
vectors are connected to the new coordinate system via:
ˆx = cosθˆe1 −sinθˆe2
ˆy = sinθˆe1 +cosθˆe2
(6.25)
Substitution of (6.25) into (6.24) yields for the electric ﬁeld
E(z,t) = (E1ˆe1 +E2ˆe2)ei(kz−ωt)
(6.26)
where
E1 ≡Ex cosθ +Ey sinθ
E2 ≡−Ex sinθ +Ey cosθ
(6.27)
  
Figure 6.6 Electric ﬁeld compo-
nents written in the ˆe1–ˆe2 basis.
Now we introduce the effect of the polarizer on the ﬁeld: E1 is transmitted
unaffected, while E2 is extinguished. To account for the effect of the device, we
multiply E2 by a parameter ξ. In the case of the polarizer, ξ is zero, but when we
consider wave plates we will use other values for ξ. After traversing the polarizer,
the ﬁeld becomes
Eafter (z,t) = (E1ˆe1 +ξE2ˆe2)ei(kz−ωt)
(6.28)
We now have the ﬁeld after the polarizer, but it would be nice to rewrite it in terms
of the original x–y basis. By inverting (6.25), or again by inspection of Fig. 6.6, we
see that
ˆe1 = cosθˆx+sinθˆy
ˆe2 = −sinθˆx+cosθˆy
(6.29)
Substitution of these relationships into (6.28) together with the deﬁnitions (6.27)

Notice that if ξ = 1 (i.e. no polarizer), then we get back exactly what we started
with (i.e. (6.30) reduces to (6.24)).
Edwin H. Land (19091991, American)
was born in Bridgeport Connecticut.
He began college at Harvard University,
but dropped out to work on his idea
of making an inexpensive polarizer. He
had access to scientic literature at New
York Public Library. He gained access
to laboratory equipment by sneaking
into Columbia University after hours. In
a major breakthrough. Land invented
what later would be called polaroid lm.
He resumed his studies at Harvard, but
never graduated. This was in spite of
the eorts of his wife who would ex-
tract answers from him and write up his
homework. A few years later, Land and
a nancial backer formed Polaroid Cor-
poration, which had tremendous success
and growth thanks to Land's continued
innovations over the years, including
his development of an instant camera.
Land would often work on a problem for
days without going home or changing
his clothes. He sometimes needed to be
reminded to eat. (Wikipedia)
To get to the Jones matrix for the polarizer, we note that (6.30) is a linear mix-
ture of Ex and Ey which can be represented with matrix algebra. If we represent
the electric ﬁeld as a two-dimensional column vector with its x component in the
top and its y component in the bottom (like a Jones vector), then we can rewrite
(6.30) as
Eafter (z,t) =
·
cos2 θ +ξsin2 θ
sinθcosθ −ξsinθcosθ
sinθcosθ −ξsinθcosθ
sin2 θ +ξcos2 θ
¸· Ex
Ey
¸
ei(kz−ωt)
(6.31)
The matrix here is a properly normalized Jones matrix, even though we did not
bother factoring out Eeff to make a properly normalized Jones vector, as speciﬁed
in (6.5). We can now write down the Jones matrix for a polarizer by inserting ξ = 0
into the matrix:
·
cos2 θ
sinθcosθ
sinθcosθ
sin2 θ
¸
(polarizer with transmission axis at angle θ) (6.32)
Notice that when θ = 0 this matrix reduces to that of a horizontal polarizer (6.19),
and when θ = π/2, it reduces to that of a vertical polarizer (6.20).
6.6
Jones Matrix for Wave Plates
We next consider wave plates (or retarders), which are usually made from birefrin-
gent crystals. The index of refraction in the crystal depends on the orientation of
the electric ﬁeld polarization. A wave plate has the appearance of a thin window
through which the light passes. The crystal is cut such that the wave plate has
a fast and a slow axis, which are 90◦apart in the plane of the window. If the
light is polarized along the fast axis, it experiences index nfast. The orthogonal
polarization component experiences higher index nslow.
When a plane wave passes through a wave plate, the component of the electric
ﬁeld oriented along the fast axis travels faster than its orthogonal counterpart,
which introduces a relative phase between the two polarization components.
As light passes through a wave plate of thickness d, the phase difference that
accumulates between the fast and the slow polarization components is
kslowd −kfastd = 2πd
λvac
(nslow −nfast)
(6.33)

152
Chapter 6 Polarization of Light
By adjusting the thickness of the wave plate, one can introduce any desired phase
difference.
The most common types of wave plates are the quarter-wave plate and the
half-wave plate. The quarter-wave plate introduces a phase difference of
kslowd −kfastd = π/2+2πm
(quarter-wave plate) (6.34)
between the two polarization components, where m is an integer. This means
that the polarization component along the slow axis is delayed spatially by a
quarter wavelength (or ﬁve quarters, etc.).
The half-wave plate introduces a phase difference of
kslowd −kfastd = π+2πm
(half-wave plate) (6.35)
where m is an integer. This means that the polarization component along the
slow axis is delayed spatially by a half wavelength (or three halves, etc.). When
m = 0 in either (6.34) or (6.35), the wave plate is said to be zero order.

The derivation of the Jones matrix for the two wave plates is essentially the
same as the derivation for the polarizer in the previous section. Let ˆe1 correspond
to the fast axis, and let ˆe2 correspond to the slow axis, as illustrated in Fig. 6.7. We
proceed as before. However, instead of setting ξ equal to zero in (6.31), we must
choose values for ξ appropriate for each wave plate. Since nothing is absorbed,
ξ should have a magnitude equal to one. The important feature is the phase of
ξ. As seen in (6.33), the ﬁeld component along the slow axis accumulates excess
phase relative to the component along the fast axis, and we let ξ account for this.
In the case of the quarter-wave plate, the appropriate factor from (6.34) is
ξ = eiπ/2 = i
(quarter-wave plate) (6.36)
This describes a relative phase delay for the light emerging with polarization along
the slow axis. Substituting (6.36) into (6.30) yields the Jones matrix for a quarter
wave plate:
·
cos2 θ +i sin2 θ
sinθcosθ −i sinθcosθ
sinθcosθ −i sinθcosθ
sin2 θ +i cos2 θ
¸
(quarter-wave plate) (6.37)
For the half-wave plate, the appropriate factor applied to the slow axis is
ξ = eiπ = −1
(half-wave plate) (6.38)
and the Jones matrix becomes:
· cos2 θ −sin2 θ

Remember that θ refers to the angle that the fast axis makes with respect to the
x-axis.
Before moving on, consider the following two examples that illustrate how
wave plates are often used:

The linearly polarized light becomes right-circularly polarized (see Table 6.1)
The previous example shows that a quarter-wave plate (properly oriented) can
change linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light. A quarter wave plate
can perform the reverse operation as well. On the other hand, as seen in the next
example, a half-wave plate can rotate the polarization angle of linearly polarized
light by varying degrees while preserving the linear polarization.

Polarization Effects of Reﬂection and Transmission
When light encounters a material interface, the amount of reﬂected and trans-
mitted light depends on the polarization. The Fresnel coefﬁcients (3.20)–(3.23)
dictate how much of each polarization is reﬂected and how much is transmitted.
In addition, the Fresnel coefﬁcients keep track of phases intrinsic in the reﬂec-
tion phenomenon. This is true also for reﬂections from multilayer coatings with
effective Fresnel coefﬁcients (4.59), (4.60), (4.64) and (4.65).

154
Chapter 6 Polarization of Light
To the extent that the s and p components of the ﬁeld behave differently,
the overall polarization state is altered. For example, a linearly-polarized ﬁeld
upon reﬂection can become elliptically polarized (see L 6.9). Even when a wave
reﬂects at normal incidence so that the s and p components are indistinguishable,
right-circular polarized light becomes left-circular polarized. This is the same
effect that causes a right-handed person to appear left-handed when viewed in a
mirror.
  
  
Figure 6.9 Incident, reﬂected and
transmitted plane waves, each
propagating along the z-axis of its
own reference frame.
We can use Jones calculus to keep track of how reﬂection and transmission
inﬂuences polarization. However, before proceeding, we emphasize that in this
context we do not strictly adhere to a single coordinate system as we did in
chapter 3, for example in Fig. 3.1. Instead, we consider each plane wave, whether
incident, reﬂected or transmitted, to propagate in the z-direction of its own frame,
regardless of the relative angles between the incident and reﬂected wave. This
loose manner of deﬁning coordinate systems, depicted in Fig. 6.9, has a great
advantage. The x and y dimensions in each individual frame is aligned parallel
to their respective s and p ﬁeld component. We will adopt the convention that
p-polarized light in all cases is associated with the x-dimension (horizontal, say).
The s-polarized component then lies along the y-dimension (vertical). These
conventions are different from those used in chapter 3 but will do us no harm.
We are now in a position to see why there is a handedness inversion upon
reﬂection from a mirror. Notice in Fig. 6.9 that for the incident light, the s-
component of the ﬁeld crossed into the p-component of the ﬁeld yields a vector
pointing along the beam’s propagation direction. However, for the reﬂected light,
the s-component crossed into the p-component points opposite to that beam’s
propagation direction.
The Jones matrix corresponding to reﬂection from a surface is
· −rp
0
0
rs
¸
(Jones matrix for reﬂection) (6.43)
By convention, we place the minus sign on the coefﬁcient rp to take care of
handedness inversion. We could put the minus sign on rs instead; the important
point is that the two polarizations acquire a relative phase differential of π when
the propagation direction ﬂips.3
The Fresnel coefﬁcients specify the ratios of the exiting ﬁelds to the incident
ones. When (6.43) operates on an arbitrary Jones vector such as (6.11), −rp
multiplies the horizontal component of the ﬁeld, and rs multiplies the vertical
component of the ﬁeld. Especially in the case of reﬂection from an absorbing
surface such as a metal, the phases of the two polarization components can vary
markedly (see P6.13). Thus, linearly polarized light containing both s- and p-
components in general becomes elliptically polarized when reﬂected from such a
surface. When light undergoes total internal reﬂection, again the phases of the s-

our convention, rs and rp are identical at normal incidence.

and p-components differ markedly, which can cause linearly polarized light to
become elliptically polarized (see P6.14).
Transmission through a material interface can also inﬂuence the polarization
of the ﬁeld, although typically to a lesser degree. However, there is no handedness
inversion, since the light continues on in a forward sense. The Jones matrix for
transmission is

dence does not coincide for suc-
cessive elements in an optical
system, a rotation matrix must be
applied to rotate the x-axis to the
plane of incidence before comput-
ing the effect of each element.
If a beam of light encounters a series of mirrors, the ﬁnal polarization is
determined by multiplying the sequence of appropriate Jones matrices (6.43)
onto the initial polarization. This procedure is straightforward if the normals
to all of the mirrors lie in a single plane (say parallel to the surface of an optical
bench). However, if the beam path deviates from this plane (due to vertical
tilt on the mirrors), then we must reorient our coordinate system before each
mirror to have a new ‘horizontal’ (p-polarized dimension) and the new ‘vertical’
(s-polarized dimension). Earlier in this chapter we performed a rotation of a
coordinate system through an angle θ, described in (6.27), which is also useful
here. The rotation can be accomplished by multiplying the following matrix onto
the incident Jones vector:
·
cosθ
sinθ
−sinθ

¸
(rotation of coordinates through an angle θ) (6.45)
This is understood as a rotation about the z-axis. The angle of rotation θ is
chosen such that the rotated x-axis lies in the plane of incidence for the mirror.
When such a reorientation of coordinates is necessary, the two orthogonal ﬁeld
components in the initial coordinate system are stirred together to form the ﬁeld
components in the new system. This does not change the intrinsic characteristics
of the polarization, just its representation.
Appendix 6.A
Ellipsometry
Measuring the polarization of light reﬂected from a surface can yield information
regarding the optical properties of that surface. As done in L 6.9, it is possible
to characterize the polarization of a beam of light using a quarter-wave plate
and a polarizer. However, we often want to measure reﬂections at a range of
frequencies, and this would require a different quarter-wave plate thickness d
for each wavelength used (see (6.34)). Therefore, many commercial ellipsometers
do not try to extract the helicity of the light, but only the ellipticity. In this case
only polarizers are needed, which can be made to work over a wide range of
wavelengths. If, in addition, a variety of incident angles are measured, it is possible
to extract detailed information about the optical constants n and κ and the
thicknesses of possibly many layers of materials inﬂuencing the reﬂection.
Commercial ellipsometers4 typically employ two polarizers, one before and

one after the sample, where s and p-polarized reﬂections take place. The ﬁrst
polarizer ensures that linearly polarized light arrives at the test surface (polarized
at angle α to give both s and p-components). The Jones matrix for the test surface
reﬂection is given by (6.43), and the Jones matrix for the analyzing polarizer
oriented at angle θ is given by (6.32). The Jones vector for the light arriving at the
detector is then

high precision. Then equations (6.50) can be inverted (see problem P6.15) to

possible even to characterize multilayer coatings involving layers with varying
thicknesses and indices.
Appendix 6.B
Partially Polarized Light
We outline here an approach for dealing with partially polarized light, which is a
mixture of polarized and unpolarized light. Most natural light such as sunshine is

unpolarized. The transverse electric ﬁeld direction in natural light varies rapidly
(and quasi randomly). Such variations imply the superposition of multiple fre-
quencies as opposed to the single frequency assumed in the formulation of Jones
calculus earlier in this chapter. Unpolarized light can become partially polarized
when it, for example, reﬂects from a surface at oblique incidence, since s and p
components of the polarization might reﬂect with differing strength.
Sir George Gabriel Stokes (18191903,
Irish) was born in Skreen, Ireland. He
entered Cambridge University at age 18
and graduated four years later with the
distinction of senior wrangler. In 1849,
he became a professor of mathematics
at Cambridge where he later worked
with James Clerk Maxwell and Lord
Kelvin to form the Cambridge School
of Mathematical Physics. Stokes was a
powerful mathematician as well as good
experimentalist, often testing his the-
oretical solutions in the laboratory. In
addition to his contributions to optics,
Stokes made important contributions to
uid dynamics (e.g. the Navier-Stokes
equations) and to mathematical physics;
Stokes' theorem is employed several
places in this in this book.(Wikipedia)
Stokes vectors are used to keep track of the partial polarization (and atten-
uation) of a light beam as the light progresses through an optical system.5 In
contrast, Jones vectors are designed for pure polarization states. We can consider
any light beam as an intensity sum of completely unpolarized light and perfectly
polarized light:
I = Ipol + Iun
(6.52)
It is assumed that both types of light propagate in the same direction.
The main characteristic of unpolarized light is that it cannot be extinguished
by a single polarizer (even in combination with a wave plate). Moreover, the
transmission of unpolarized light through an ideal polarizer is always 50%. On the
other hand, polarized light (be it linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized) can
always be represented by a Jones vector, and it is always possible to extinguish it
using a quarter wave plate and a single polarizer.
We may introduce the degree of polarization as the fraction of the intensity
that is in a deﬁnite polarization state:
ξpol ≡
Ipol
Ipol + Iun
(6.53)
The degree of polarization takes on values between zero and one. Thus, if the light
is completely unpolarized (such that Ipol = 0), the degree of polarization is zero,
and if the beam is fully polarized (such that Iun = 0), the degree of polarization is
one.
A Stokes vector, which characterizes a partially polarized beam, is written as

is a comparison of the beam’s intensity (or power) to a benchmark or ’input’
intensity, Iin, measured before the beam enters the optical system under consid-
eration. I represents the intensity at the point of investigation, where one wishes
to characterize the beam. Thus, the value S0 = 1 represents the input intensity,

Chapter 6 Polarization of Light
and S0 can drop to values less than one, to account for attenuation of light by
polarizers in the system. (S0 could increase in the atypical case of ampliﬁcation.)
The next parameter, S1, describes how much the light looks either horizontally
or vertically polarized, and it is deﬁned as
S1 ≡2Ihor
Iin
−S0
(6.55)
Here, Ihor represents the amount of light detected if an ideal linear polarizer is
placed with its axis aligned horizontally directly in front of the detector (inserted
where the light is characterized). S1 ranges between negative one and one, taking
on its extremes when the light is linearly polarized either horizontally or vertically,
respectively. If the light has been attenuated, it may still be perfectly horizontally
polarized even if S1 has a magnitude less than one. (Alternatively, one might
examine S1/S0, which is guaranteed to range between negative one and one.)
The parameter S2 describes how much the light looks linearly polarized along
the diagonals. It is given by
S2 ≡2I45◦
Iin
−S0
(6.56)
Similar to the previous case, I45◦represents the amount of light detected if an
ideal linear polarizer is placed with its axis at 45◦directly in front of the detector
(inserted where the light is characterized). As before, S2 ranges between negative
one and one, taking on extremes when the light is linearly polarized either at 45◦
or 135◦.
Finally, S3 characterizes the extent to which the beam is either right or left
circularly polarized:
S3 ≡2Ir-cir
Iin
−S0
(6.57)
Here, Ir-cir represents the amount of light detected if an ideal right-circular po-
larizer is placed directly in front of the detector. A right-circular polarizer is
one that passes right-handed polarized light, but blocks left handed polarized
light. One way to construct such a polarizer is a quarter wave plate, followed
by a linear polarizer with the transmission axis aligned 45◦from the wave-plate
fast axis, followed by another quarter wave plate at −45◦from the polarizer (see
P6.12).6 Again, this parameter ranges between negative one and one, taking on
the extremes for right and left circular polarization, respectively.
Importantly, if any of the parameters S1, S2, or S3 take on their extreme values
(i.e. a magnitude equal to S0), the other two parameters necessarily equal zero.
As an example, if a beam is linearly polarized in the horizontal direction with
I = Iin, then we have Ihor = Iin, I45◦= Iin/2, and Ir-cir = Iin/2. This yields S0 = 1,
S1 = 1, S2 = 0, and S3 = 0. As a second example, suppose that the light has
been attenuated to I = Iin/3 but is purely left circularly polarized. Then we have
6The ﬁnal quarter wave plate is to put the light back into the original circular state – not needed
to measure the Stokes parameter.

6.B Partially Polarized Light

Ihor = Iin/6, I45◦= Iin/6, and Ir-cir = 0. Whereas the Stokes parameters are S0 = 1/3,
S1 = 0, S2 = 0, and S3 = −1/3.
Another interesting case is completely unpolarized light, which transmits 50%
through all of the polarizers discussed above. In this case, Ihor = I45◦= Ir-cir = I/2
and S1 = S2 = S3 = 0.

Chapter 6 Polarization of Light
Note that the unpolarized portion of the light does not contribute to S1, S2,
or S3. Half of the unpolarized light survives any of the test ﬁlters, which cancels
neatly with the unpolarized portion of S0 =
Ipol+Iun
Iin
in Eqs. (6.55)–(6.57).
With the aid of the results in Example 6.4, a completely general form of the
Stokes vector may then be written as

where the Jones vector for the polarized portion of the light is
· A
B
¸
and the intensity of the polarized portion of the light is
Ipol = |A|2 +|B|2
(6.59)
Again, we have hidden the factor 1
2ϵ0c |Eeff|2 for the polarized portion of the light
inside |A|2 and |B|2.
We would like to express the degree of polarization in terms of the Stokes
parameters. We ﬁrst note that the quantity

(6.53) yields

(6.61)
If the light is polarized such that it perfectly transmits through or is perfectly
extinguished by one of the three test polarizers associated with S1, S2, or S3, then
the degree of polarization will be unity. Obviously, it is possible to have pure
polarization states that are not aligned with the axes of any one of these test
polarizers. In this situation, the degree of polarization is still one, although the
values S1, S2, and S3 may all three contribute to (6.61).
Finally, it is possible to represent polarizing devices as matrices that operate
on the Stokes vectors in much the same way that Jones matrices operate on
Jones vectors. Since Stokes vectors are four-dimensional, the matrices used are
four-by-four. These are known as Mueller matrices.8

Hans Mueller (1900-1965, Swiss) was
a shepherd until his late teens. As a
physics professor at MIT, he built on
the work of Stokes and in 1943 formu-
lated a matrix method for manipulating
Stokes vectors. He was an engaging lec-
turer into the 1950s and was known for
his exciting demonstrations. He was a
student of Arnold Sommerfeld, and did
seminal work on ferroelectricity (he is
reported to have coined the term). See

Then ﬁnd the polarizer angle (call it α) that gives a maximum (or a
minimum) of intensity. The angle then corresponds to an axis of the
ellipse inscribing the E-ﬁeld as it spirals. When taking the arctangent,
remember that it is deﬁned only over half of the unit circle. You can
add π for another valid result (which gives a second ellipse axis).

wave plate (oriented at a special angle θ) to convert the unknown
elliptically polarized light into linearly polarized light. A subsequent
polarizer can then extinguish the light, from which you can determine
the Jones vector of the light coming through the wave plate. This must
equal the original (unknown) Jones vector (6.11) operated on by the
wave plate (6.37). As you solve the matrix equation, it is helpful to note
that the inverse of (6.37) is its own complex conjugate.

Chapter 7
Superposition of Quasi-Parallel
Plane Waves
In previous chapters, we considered only individual plane-wave ﬁelds which
have uniform intensity throughout space and time. Some optical ﬁelds can be
well-approximated by a plane wave, but most have a more complicated structure.
It turns out that any ﬁeld (e.g. pulses or a focused beam), regardless of how
complicated, can be described by a superposition of many plane wave ﬁelds. In
this chapter, we develop the techniques for superimposing plane waves.
We begin our analysis with a discrete sum of plane wave ﬁelds and show how
to calculate the intensity in this case. We will introduce the concept of group
velocity, which describes the motion of interference ‘fringes’ or ‘packet’ resulting
when multiple plane waves are superimposed. Group velocity is distinct from
phase velocity that we encountered previously. As we saw in chapter 2, the real
part of refractive index in certain situations can be less than one, indicating
superluminal wave crest propagation (i.e. greater than c)! However, it is the group
velocity that tracks the speed of interference fringes, which are associated with
light intensity.
In section 7.3, we extend our analysis of wave superposition to a continuum
of plane waves. The analysis is based on Fourier theory, which is a tool for keeping
track of the plane waves that make up a given waveform E(r,t). We will learn
how to decompose arbitrary waveforms into plane waves components, which
we know how to propagate in a material (with a frequency-dependent index).
Conversely, we will also learn how to reassemble plane waves into a ﬁnal pulse at
the end of propagation.
Different frequency components of a waveform experience different phase
velocities, causing the waveform to undergo distortion as it propagates, a phe-
nomenon called dispersion. Narrowband packets (i.e. packets comprised of a
narrow range of frequencies and hence long duration) tend to maintain their
shape (with some spreading) while propagating at the group velocity. On the
other hand, broadband pulses (i.e. packets comprised of many frequencies and
possibly of short duration) tend to distort severely while propagating in materials.
169

170
Chapter 7 Superposition of Quasi-Parallel Plane Waves
It turns out that group velocity can also become superluminal when signif-
icant absorption and/or ampliﬁcation of the light pulse is involved. This is no
cause for alarm (nor is it cause for an abundance of gee-whiz papers on the
subject). Absorption and ampliﬁcation can cause a pulse to appear to move
unexpectedly fast through a reshaping effect. Group velocity, or rather its inverse
group delay, takes this into account, which makes it remarkably general. In such
a scenario, energy can be lost from the back of a pulse or perhaps added to an
already-present forward portion of a pulse such that the average pulse position
appears to advance superluminally. When all energy is accounted for (both the
energy in the medium and in the light pulse), however, nothing advances faster
than the universal speed limit c. Appendix 7.B provides analysis of how a medium
exchanges energy with a pulse to produce these eye-catching effects.
7.1
Intensity of Superimposed Plane Waves
We can construct arbitrary waveforms by adding together many plane waves with
different propagation directions, amplitudes, phases, frequencies and polariza-
tions. Consider the following discrete sum of plane waves:
E(r,t) =
X
j
Ejei(kj ·r−ωj t)
(7.1)
The corresponding magnetic ﬁeld according to (2.56) is
B(r,t) =
X
j
Bjei(kj ·r−ωj t) =
X
j
kj ×Ej
ωj
ei(kj ·r−ωj t)
(7.2)
As usual, the (time- and space-independent) individual ﬁeld components Ej
contain both amplitude and phase information for each plane wave.
The Poynting vector (2.52) associated with the ﬁelds (7.1) and (7.2) is
S(r,t) = Re{E(r,t)}× Re{B(r,t)}

km ×Emei(km·r−ωmt)o
(7.3)
(Recall the conspiracy that only the real parts of the ﬁelds are relevant – crucial
before multiplying.) The above expression is cumbersome because of the many
cross terms that arise when the two summations are multiplied. We need some
simplifying assumptions before we can make any real progress on this expression.
For example, we can time-average the rapid ﬂuctuations in the expression that
vary on the scale of optical frequencies. Additionally, it is common to encounter
the situation where all plane-wave components travel roughly parallel to each
other, which will be a big help in simplifying (7.3). Let us further assume that the
km vectors are real.1
1If the wave vectors are complex, the result is essentially the same, but, as in (2.62), the ﬁeld
amplitudes Ej correspond to local amplitudes (adjusted for absorption or ampliﬁcation during
prior propagation).

The terms involving (ωj + ωm)t oscillate rapidly and time-average to zero. By
comparison, the terms involving (ωj −ωm)t oscillate slowly (especially when the
ωj are all in the neighborhood of the ωm) or not at all when j = m. We retain the
slower ﬂuctuations and discard the rapid oscillations. For purposes of computing
the intensity we can approximate the index as approximately constant, and write
km/(ωmµ0) ≈nϵ0c. With these simpliﬁcations, (7.5) becomes

The ﬁnal expression in (7.6) is already manifestly real so there is no need to
apply the operation Re{ }. The time-averaged intensity for light composed of
parallel wave vectors is then well-approximated by
I(r,t) = nϵ0c

E(r,t)·E∗(r,t)

k-vectors and approximately

(7.7)
In a surprising turn of events, it is important that E(r,t) in (7.7) be written as the
entire complex expression for the electric ﬁeld rather than just the real part. Then
(7.7) automatically time-averages over rapid oscillations in such a way that I(r,t)

Chapter 7 Superposition of Quasi-Parallel Plane Waves
retains a slowly varying time dependence. This expression is reminiscent of (2.62),
but it should be kept in mind that we previously considered only a single plane
wave (perhaps with two distinct polarization components).
If some of the k-vectors point in an anti-parallel direction, we can still use (7.7).
This brings up a distinction between irradiance S and intensity I. For example,
〈S〉is zero for standing waves because there is no net ﬂow of energy, whereas
(7.7) still gives a result. Intensity speciﬁes whether atoms locally experience an
oscillating electric ﬁeld without regard for whether there is a net ﬂow of energy
carried by a light ﬁeld.2
We can relax the restriction of parallel kj’s slightly and apply (7.7) also to plane
waves with nearly parallel kj’s. Such a situation occurs, for example, in a Young’s
two-slit diffraction experiment (studied in chapter 8).

Group vs. Phase Velocity: Sum of Two Plane Waves
Figure 7.1 Animation showing su-
perposition of two plane waves
(electric ﬁelds) with different fre-
quencies and traveling at different
speeds.
To begin our study of interference, consider just two plane waves with equal
amplitudes given by
E1 = E0ei(k1·r−ω1t)
and
E2 = E0ei(k2·r−ω2t)
(7.8)
As we previously studied (see P1.9), the velocities of the wave crests for these two
waves are
vp1 = ω1/k1
and
vp2 = ω2/k2
(7.9)
These are known as the phase velocities of the individual plane waves.
Next consider a composite wave created from the superposition of the above
two plane waves:
E(r,t) = E0ei(k1·r−ω1t) +E0ei(k2·r−ω2t)
(7.10)
The two plane waves interfere, producing regions of higher and lower intensity
that move in time. Remarkably, these intensity peaks can propagate at speeds
quite different from either of the phase velocities in (7.9). The intensity (7.7) for
the ﬁeld (7.10) is computed as follows:

2At extreme intensities, when the inﬂuence of the magnetic ﬁeld becomes comparable to that of
the electric ﬁeld, the distinction between propagating and standing ﬁelds becomes important to
the behavior of charged particles in that ﬁeld.

7.2 Group vs. Phase Velocity: Sum of Two Plane Waves
173
The darker line in Fig. 7.2 shows the intensity computed with (7.11). Keep in
mind that this intensity is averaged over rapid oscillations. For comparison, the
lighter line shows the Poynting ﬂux with the rapid oscillations retained, according
to (7.5). It is left as an exercise (see P7.3) to show that the rapid-oscillation peaks
in Fig. 7.2 move with a phase velocity derived from the average k and average ω
of the two plane waves:
vp ≡¯ω

(7.13)
An examination of the cosine argument in (7.11) reveals that the time-averaged
curve in Fig. 7.2 (dark) travels with speed
vg ≡∆ω

(7.14)
This is known as the group velocity. Essentially, vg may be thought of as the
velocity for the envelope that encloses the rapid oscillations. As noted, the group
velocity is often written as a derivative rather than a ratio of ﬁnite differences; the
derivative will be more natural when dealing with a continuum of plane waves
rather than a pair of planes.
Sir William Rowen Hamilton (1805
1865, Irish) was born in Dublin, Ire-
land, the fourth of nine children. At a
very early age, he showed a remarkable
ability to learn languages while living
with his uncle who was a linguist. He
became procient in nearly a dozen
languages and in later life enjoyed read-
ing in various languages as a means
of relaxation. At age eight, Hamilton
entered a mental arithmetic contest
against a nine-year-old prodigy from
America. Hamilton lost and as a result
determined to spend much more time
on mathematics instead of languages.
Hamilton went on to to make enormous
contributions to mathematical physics.
His reformulation of classical dynamics
proved to be the ideal framework for
later developments in electrodynam-
ics, quantum mechanics, and quantum
eld theory. Ironically, Hamilton was
originally employed as an observational
astronomer at Dunsink Obervatory, a
post for which he was not particularly
well suited. The University of Dublin
didn't mind, however, owing to the out-
standing quality of his theoretical per
suits. Hamilton is credited with rst ar-
ticulating the concept of group velocity,
although only abstracts of his lectures
on the subject have been preserved: Re-
searches respecting vibration, connected
with the theory of light, Proc. Roy. Irish
Acad. 1, 267, 341 (1839).(Wikipedia)
In general, vg and vp are not the same. This means that as the waveform
propagates, the rapid oscillations move within the larger modulation pattern, for
example, continually disappearing at the front and reappearing at the back of
each modulation. The group velocity is identiﬁed with the propagation of overall
waveforms. The presence of intensity in a waveform is clearly tied more to vg
than to vp.
Example 7.1
Determine the phase velocity and group velocity for the superposition of two plane
waves in a plasma (see P2.7).
Solution: The index of refraction is given by
nplasma(ω) =
q
1−ω2
p/ω2 < 1
(assuming ω > ωp) (7.15)
The phase velocity for each frequency is computed as
vp =
ω1 +ω2
nplasma(ω1)ω1/c +nplasma(ω2)ω2/c
∼=
c
nplasma(ω)
(7.16)
For convenience, we have taken ω1 and ω2 to lie very close to each other. Since
nplasma < 1, both of these velocities exceed c. However, the group velocity is
vg = ∆ω
∆k
∼= dω
dk =
· dk

¸−1

dω
ωnplasma (ω)
c
¸−1

(7.17)
which is clearly less than c. The derivation of the ﬁnal expression in (7.17) from
the previous one is left as an exercise.

174
Chapter 7 Superposition of Quasi-Parallel Plane Waves
Example 7.1 illustrates that in an environment where the index of refraction
is real (i.e. no net exchange of energy with the medium), the group velocity
does not exceed c, even when the phase velocity does. The ‘fast-moving’ phase
velocity vp results merely from an interplay between the ﬁeld and the plasma.
In a similar sense, the intersection of an ocean wave with the shoreline can also
exceed c, if different points on the wave front happen to strike the shore nearly
simultaneously. The point of intersection between the wave and the shoreline
does not constitute an actual object under motion. Similarly, wave crests of a
wave, at least when interacting with a medium, do not necessarily constitute
actual objects in motion. That is, vp is not the relevant speed at which events up
stream inﬂuence events down stream in a medium.
John William Strutt (3rd Baron
Rayleigh) (18421919, British) was
born in Langford Grove, Essex, England
and was frequently ill in his youth. He
entered the University of Cambridge in
1861 and graduated four years later as
senior wrangler in mathematics. He mar-
ried in 1871 and became the father of
three sons. In 1873, Strutt inherited the
Barony of Rayleigh (and the title Lord
Rayleigh) from his father who died that
year. In 1879 Strutt succeeded James
Clerk Maxwell as the Cavendish Profes-
sor of Physics at Cambridge. Rayleigh
studied a wide variety of subjects. He
is credited with the discovery of argon.
He studied how atoms scatter light
(Rayleigh scattering) and explained why
the sky is blue. He extensively devel-
oped the notion of group velocity and
used it to understand the propagation
of sound. He won the Nobel prize in
physics in 1904 for investigations of
gas densities and for discovering argon.

7.3
Frequency Spectrum of Light
Individual plane waves have inﬁnite length and inﬁnite duration. They do not
exist in isolation except in our imagination. Moreover, a waveform constructed
from a discrete sum (as in the previous two sections) must eventually repeat over
and over (i.e. it is periodic). To create a waveform that does not repeat (e.g. a
single laser pulse or, technically speaking, any waveform that exists in the physical
world since no light source repeats forever) we must replace the discrete sum (7.1)
with an integral that combines a continuum of plane waves. Such a waveform at
a point r can be expressed as
E(r,t) =
1
p
2π
∞
Z
−∞
E(r,ω)e−iωtdω
(7.18)
The function E(r,ω), called the spectrum, has units of ﬁeld per frequency. Essen-
tially, it gives the amplitude and phase of each plane wave that makes up the over-
all waveform. It includes any spatially dependent factors such as exp{ik(ω)·r}.
We distinguish the spectrum E(r,ω) from the wholly separate function E(r,t) by
its argument (i.e. ω instead of t). (Sorry for using E for both functions, but this is
standard notation.) The operation (7.18) is called an inverse Fourier transform as
outlined in section 0.4; it would be a good idea to review section 0.4 thoroughly.
Now. Why haven’t you turned to section 0.4 yet? The factor 1/
p
2π is introduced to
match our Fourier-transform convention. Notice that (7.18) merely sums together
a range of plane waves in much the same way that the discrete summation (7.1)
does.
Given a waveform E(r,t), one might wonder what plane waves should be
added together in order to construct it. Equation (7.18) can be inverted, which
remarkably has a very similar form:
E(r,ω) =
1
p
2π
∞
Z
−∞
E(r,t)eiωtdt
(7.19)

7.3 Frequency Spectrum of Light
175
This operation is called the Fourier transform. It is used to generate the spectrum
E(r,ω) from the ﬁeld E(r,t) in much the same way that (7.18) is used to generate
the ﬁeld E(r,t) from the spectrum E(r,ω).
Although only the real part of E(r,t) is physically relevant, we can continue
our habit of working with the complex ﬁeld and taking the real part of E(r,t) at
our leisure.3 In fact, we will ﬁnd it advantageous to work with the complex ﬁeld
instead of only the real part. We will not run into trouble as long as we remember
never to discard the imaginary part of E(r,ω), only the imaginary part of E(r,t).
The intensity formula (7.7) remains useful for continuous superpositions of
plane waves (i.e. a ﬁeld deﬁned by the inverse Fourier transform (7.18)):
I(r,t) ≡nϵ0c
2
E(r,t)·E∗(r,t)
(7.20)
Remember, this formula speciﬁcally requires the ﬁelds to be in complex for-
mat, and it takes care of the time-average over rapid oscillations automatically.4
Moreover, the above expression for I (r,t) assumes that all relevant k-vectors are
essentially parallel.
Similarly, we will deﬁne the power spectrum produced from E(r,ω), which we
write as
I (r,ω) ≡nϵ0c
2
E(r,ω)·E∗(r,ω)
(7.21)
The power spectrum I (r,ω) is what one observes when the waveform is sent into
a spectral analyzer or spectrometer. We must apologize again for the potentially
confusing notation (in wide usage): I (r,ω) is not the Fourier transform of I(r,t)!
They are deﬁned exclusively through (7.20) and (7.21).
Parseval’s theorem (see Example 0.7) imposes an interesting connection be-
tween the time-integral of the intensity and the frequency-integral of the power
spectrum:
∞
Z
−∞
I(r,t)dt =
∞
Z
−∞
I (r,ω)dω
(7.22)
With the above formalities out of the way, we will illustrate the use of Fourier
transforms through some examples.

ﬁeld (7.23) with T = 4π/ω0 and
T = 10π/ω0, where 2π/ω0 is the
period of the carrier frequency.
Example 7.2
Find E(r,ω) associated with the ﬁeld
E(r,t) = E0 (r)e−t2±
2T 2 e−iω0t
(7.23)
3Since Fourier transforms are linear, one can take the Fourier transform of the real and imaginary
parts of a ﬁeld separately. Appropriate modiﬁcations to E(r,ω) in the frequency domain will not
cause the two parts to become mingled. Upon taking the inverse Fourier transform to obtain E(r,t)
again, the original real part remains purely real, and the original imaginary part remains purely
imaginary.
4To use this expression there needs to be a sufﬁcient number of oscillations within the waveform
to make the rapid time average meaningful.

Chapter 7 Superposition of Quasi-Parallel Plane Waves
The real part of this ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 7.3 for two different durations T . The
intensity proﬁle computed by (7.20) is shown in Fig. 7.4 .
Solution: The argument r is unimportant to our calculation. It merely speciﬁes
that we are considering the ﬁeld at the point r. We compute the Fourier transform
as follows:
E(r,ω) =

Figure 7.4 The intensity (7.20) of
the ﬁelds in Fig. 7.3.
E(r,ω) = T E0 (r)e−T 2(ω−ω0)2
2
(7.25)
Notice that E(r,ω) has units of Field multiplied by time, or in other words, ﬁeld per
frequency.
In general, E(r,ω) is a complex function. E(r,ω) keeps track of the amplitude
and phase of each plane wave needed to compose the waveform E(r,t). More of-
ten than not, E(r,ω) exhibits a complicated complex phase structure, depending
on the time-shape of E(r,t).
The spectrum of the ﬁeld in Example 7.2 is shown in Fig. 7.5. The complex
phase turns out to be boringly uniform for this example; if E0 is real, the imaginary
part of the spectrum turns out to be zero for all frequencies. The corresponding
power spectrum (7.21) is plotted in Fig. 7.6. As expected, the waveform includes
frequencies in the neighborhood of ω0.
A range of frequencies are needed to construct a waveform that turns on
and off. The shorter the duration of the waveform, the wider the frequency
spectrum that is necessary. Note that the temporal width of the waveform (7.23)
is dictated by T while the spectral width of (7.25) is given by Ω≡1/T . This gives an
uncertainty product T Ω= 1. This dictates the minimum spectral width necessary
to produce a pulse of a given duration.

Since only the real part of the time proﬁle E(r,t) is physically relevant, you
might be curious about how the Fourier transform of the real part of the ﬁeld
compares with that of the complex version of the ﬁeld that we have been using.
Indeed, there are situations where it is more appropriate to use the real version
of the ﬁeld rather than its complex form. For example, if a waveform includes
multiple propagation directions or if a waveform contains only a few cycles, then
the motivation/interpretation behind (7.20) and the convenience of the complex
format begins to wane.

From the above example, you might notice that the transform of the real
part of a ﬁeld tends to be more cumbersome than the transform of the entire
complex ﬁeld. For the real ﬁeld, both positive and negative frequency components
contribute to the overall spectrum.5 Moreover, the Fourier transform of a real
function Er (r,t) obeys the symmetry relation
Er (r,−ω) = E∗
r (r,ω)
(if Er (r,t) is real) (7.29)
whereas the Fourier transform of the complex ﬁeld depicted in Fig. 7.5 does not.
7.4
Wave Packet Propagation and Group Delay
Once we have the spectrum for a waveform (obtained by Fourier transform),
we can apply effects to the individual spectral components. In particular, we
can ﬁnd how an overall waveform propagates in a uniform medium by taking
advantage of our knowledge of how individual plane waves propagate (as studied
in chapter 2). At any point in the medium, we can perform an inverse Fourier
transform, which recombines spectral components (i.e. plane waves) to reveal
how the overall waveform looks as a function of time. Thus, we will be able to
predict the temporal proﬁle of a waveform at any location given knowledge of
that waveform at another location.6
Let E(r0,t) be the temporal proﬁle of a pulse at some point r0 in a medium.
The spectrum of this pulse E(r0,ω) (found using (7.19)) gives the amplitudes and
phases of the individual plane wave components at the point r0. A phase shift
5Essentially, the spectrum of the complex representation of the ﬁeld can be understood to be
twice the spectrum of the real representation, but plotted only for the positive frequencies.

to (see (2.20))
E(r0 +∆r,ω) = E(r0,ω)eik(ω)·∆r
(7.30)
The k-vector contains the frequency-dependent information about the material
via k = n(ω)ω/c.7 We take the inverse Fourier transform of E(r0 +∆r,ω) at the

Example 7.6 If a waveform at r0 = 0 has the form E(0,t) = E0e−t2/2T 2e−iω0t,
compute the waveform at r = zˆz if propagation occurs in vacuum in the
z-direction.
Solution: Of course, after traversing ∆r = zˆz in vacuum, the waveform will
look the same, only arriving a time z/c later. We’ll demonstrate that the
tools described above yield this expected result. The Fourier transform of
the Gaussian pulse is given in (7.25):
E(0,ω) = T E0e−

To ﬁnd the ﬁeld downstream we invoke (7.30), assuming k(ω) = kvac (ω)ˆz =

A waveform propagating in a material such as glass can undergo signiﬁcant
temporal dispersion, as different frequency components experience different
indices of refraction. Each frequency component propagates at its own phase
velocity. The speed of the pulse, however, can be quite different; the pulse as a
whole propagates approximately with the group velocity, as will be shown below.
7A complex wave vector k may also be used if absorption or ampliﬁcation is present.

(7.36)
Notice that (7.32) for propagating in vacuum agrees with this result, since kvac (ω0)·
∆r = ω0z/c. The second factor in (7.36) merely gives a phase shift governed by the
phase velocity of the carrier frequency (see (7.9)):
vp (ω0) =
ω0
k (ω0)
(7.37)
The phase shift vanishes for propagation in vacuum. Ignoring the phase shift,
(7.36) is only altered by a delay t′, the time required for the pulse to traverse the
displacement ∆r.
The function ∂k

∂ω ·∆r is known as the group delay function, and in (7.35) it
is evaluated at the carrier frequency ω0. Traditional group velocity is obtained by
dividing the displacement ∆r by the group delay time t′ to obtain

Group delay (or group velocity) essentially tracks the center of the pulse.
In our derivation we have assumed that the phase delay k(ω)·∆r could be well-
represented by the ﬁrst two terms of the expansion (7.33). While this assumption

7.5 Quadratic Dispersion
181
gives results that are often useful, higher-order terms can also play a role. In
section 7.5 we’ll ﬁnd that the next term in the expansion controls the rate at which
the pulse spreads as it travels. We should also note that there are times when the
expansion (7.33) fails to converge (when ω0 is near a resonance of the medium),
and the above expansion approach is not valid. We’ll analyze pulse propagation
in this sticky situation in section 7.6.
7.5
Quadratic Dispersion
A light pulse traversing a material in general undergoes dispersion when different
frequency components propagate with different phase velocities. As an example,
consider a short laser pulse traversing an optical component such as a lens or
window, as depicted in Fig. 7.8. The short light pulse can broaden in time8 with
the different frequency components becoming separated (often called stretching
or chirping). If absorption (and surface reﬂections) can be neglected, then the
amplitude of E(r,ω) does not change – only its phase changes – and the power
spectrum (7.21) remains unaltered.
Continuing our example of a short pulse traversing a piece of glass, we assume
that the pulse travels in the ˆz-direction. We place r0 at the start of the glass where
we assign z = 0, so that k·∆r = kz. We take the Four transform of pulse at z = 0 to
determine the amplitudes and phases of the plane waves involved.
To ﬁnd the waveform at the new position z (where the pulse presumably has
just exited the glass), we must adjust the phase of each plane wave by the factor
kz and take the inverse Fourier transform accruing to (7.31). Again, the function
k (ω) must be speciﬁed. Typically, the functional form of n (ω) spoils any chance
of doing the integral analytically. And as before, we will resort to the expansion
(7.33), but this time we will keep an additional term:
k (ω)z ∼= k0z + v−1
g (ω−ω0)z +α(ω−ω0)2 z +···

Unfortunately, even after resorting to the expansion we won’t be able to per-
form the inverse Fourier transform except for very speciﬁc initial pulses. However,
we can get an idea for how quadratic dispersion works by considering the speciﬁc
example of a Gaussian pulse.

We can immediately make a few observations about (7.46). First, note that
at z = 0 (i.e. zero thickness of glass), (7.46) reduces to the input pulse E(0,t) =
E0e−t2/2T 2e−iω0t, as it should. Secondly, the peak of the pulse moves at speed vg
since the factor e−(t−z/vg)
2/2 ˜T 2(z) controls the pulse amplitude, while the other

183
terms (multiplied by i) in the exponent of (7.46) merely alter the phase. Also
note that the duration of the pulse increases and its peak intensity decreases as it
travels, since ˜T (z) increases with z. In P7.8 we will ﬁnd that (7.46) also predicts
that for large z, the ﬁeld of the spread-out pulse oscillates less rapidly at the begin-
ning of the pulse than at the end (assuming α > 0). This phenomenon, known as
pulse chirping, means that red frequencies get ahead of blue frequencies during
propagation since the red frequencies experience a lower index of refraction.
While Example 7.7 is worked out for the speciﬁc case of a Gaussian pulse,
the results are qualitatively similar for all pulses. The exact details vary with
pulse shape, but all short pulses eventually broaden and chirp as they propagate
through a dispersive medium such as glass. Higher-order terms in the expansion
(7.33) that were neglected cause additional spreading, chirping, and other defor-
mations to the pulses as they propagates. The inﬂuence of each order becomes
progressively more cumbersome to study analytically. It is easier to perform the
inverse Fourier transform numerically; there is no need to resort to the expansion
of k(ω) if the integration is done numerically.

Generalized Context for Group Delay

parts of the refractive index for an
absorptive medium.
The expansion of k(ω) in (7.33) is inconvenient if the frequency content (band-
width) of a waveform encompasses a substantial portion of a resonance structure.
In this case, it becomes necessary to retain a large number of terms in (7.33) to
describe accurately the phase delay k(ω)·∆r. Moreover, if the bandwidth of the
waveform is wider than the spectral resonance of the medium, the series alto-
gether fails to converge. These difﬁculties have led to the traditional viewpoint
that group velocity loses meaning for broadband waveforms near a resonance. In
this section, we study a broader context for group velocity (or rather its inverse,
group delay dk/dω), which is always valid, even for broadband pulses where
the expansion (7.33) utterly fails. The analysis avoids the expansion and so is
not restricted to a narrowband context. Since the imaginary part of the index
becomes important near a resonance, we will need to treat k as complex.
We are interested in the arrival time of a waveform (or pulse) to a point, say,
where a detector is located. The deﬁnition of the arrival time of pulse energy
need only involve the Poynting ﬂux (or the intensity), since it alone is responsible
for energy transport. To deal with arbitrary broadband pulses, the arrival time
should avoid presupposing a speciﬁc pulse shape, since the pulse may evolve
in complicated ways during propagation. For example, the pulse peak or the
midpoint on the rising edge of a pulse are poor indicators of arrival time if the
pulse contains multiple peaks or a long and non-uniform rise time.
For the reasons given, we use a time expectation integral (or time ‘center-of-

(7.49)
For simpliﬁcation, we have assumed that the light travels in a uniform direction
by using intensity rather than the Poynting vector.
Consider a pulse as it travels from point r0 to point r = r0 +∆r in a homoge-
neous medium. The difference in arrival times at the two points is
∆t ≡〈t〉r −〈t〉r0
(7.50)
The pulse shape can evolve in complicated ways between the two points, spread-
ing with different portions being absorbed (or ampliﬁed) during transit as de-
picted in Fig. 7.11. Nevertheless, (7.50) renders an unambiguous time interval
between the passage of the pulse center at each point.
This difference in arrival time can be shown to consist of two terms (see
P7.11):9
∆t = ∆tG (r)+∆tR (r0)
(7.51)
The ﬁrst term, called the net group delay, dominates if the ﬁeld waveform is
initially symmetric in time (e.g. an unchirped Gaussian). It amounts to a spectral
average of the group delay function taken with respect to the spectral content of
the pulse arriving at the ﬁnal point r = r0 +∆r:

where I (r,ω) is given in (7.21). The two curves in Fig. 7.12 show I (r0,ω) (before
propagation) and I (r,ω) (after propagation) for an initially Gaussian pulse. As
seen in (7.52), the pulse travel time depends on the spectral shape of the pulse at
the end of propagation.

7.6 Generalized Context for Group Delay
185
Note the close resemblance between the formulas (7.49) and (7.52). Both are
expectation integrals. The former is executed as a ‘center-of-mass’ integral on
time; the latter is executed in the frequency domain on ∂Rek·∆r/∂ω, the group
delay function (7.38). The group delay at every frequency present in the pulse
inﬂuences the result. If the pulse has a narrow bandwidth in the neighborhood
of ω0, the integral reduces to ∂Rek/∂ω|ω0 ·∆r, in agreement with (7.38) (see P7.9).
The net group delay depends only on the spectral content of the pulse, indepen-
dent of its temporal organization (i.e., the phase of E(r,ω) has no inﬂuence). Only
the real part of the k-vector plays a direct role in (7.52).
Figure 7.13 The center of a
chirped pulse can shift owing
to the reshaping effect when spec-
trum is removed.
The second term in (7.51) is the reshaping delay ∆tR. It represents a delay
that arises solely from a reshaping of the spectral amplitude. Often this term is
negligible. The term takes into account how the pulse time center-of-mass shifts
as portions of the spectrum are removed (or added), as illustrated in Fig. 7.13. It
is computed at r0 before propagation takes place:10
∆tR (r0) = 〈t〉r0
¯¯
altered −〈t〉r0
(7.53)
Here 〈t〉r0 represents the usual arrival time of the pulse at the initial point r0,
according to (7.49). The intensity at this point is associated with a ﬁeld E(r0,t)
whose spectrum is E(r0,ω). On the other hand, 〈t〉r0
¯¯
altered is the arrival time of
a pulse with modiﬁed spectrum E(r0,ω)e−Imk·∆r. Notice that E(r0,ω)e−Imk·∆r is
still evaluated at the initial point r0. Only the spectral amplitude (not the phase)
is modiﬁed, according to what is anticipated to be lost (or gained) during the trip.
In contrast to the net group delay, the reshaping delay is sensitive to how a pulse
is organized. The reshaping delay is negligible if the pulse is initially symmetric
(in amplitude and phase) before propagation. The reshaping delay also goes to
zero in the narrowband limit, and the total delay reduces to the net group delay.

Example 7.8
Find the time required for a Gaussian pulse (7.23) to traverse a slab of absorption
material (neglecting possible surface reﬂections). Let the material response be
described by the Lorentz model described in section 2.3 with the carrier frequency
of the pulse ω0, coinciding with the material resonance frequency. Let the slab
have thickness ∆r = cγ−1/10 and absorption strength ω2
p = 10γ.
Solution: The spectrum of the initially Gaussian pulse is given by (7.25), and its
power spectrum is11

10The reshaping delay can instead be computed after propagation takes place, in which case the
net group delay should be computed with the initial rather than ﬁnal spectrum.
11In general, one should write ˜ω0 to distinguish the carrier frequency of the pulse from the
resonance frequency of the material ω0; in practice, these are often different.

Figure 7.15 Delay as a function of
pulse duration.
The narrowband pulse (with duration T1) in Example 7.8 traverses the ab-
sorbing medium superluminally (i.e. faster than c). The negative transit time
means that the ‘center-of-mass’ of the exiting pulse emerges even before the
‘center-of-mass’ of the entering pulse reaches the medium! On the other hand,
the broadband pulse (with the shorter duration T2) has a large positive delay time,
indicating that the exiting pulse emerges subluminally.
Figure 7.14 shows the intensity proﬁles for these two pulses as they traverse
the absorption slab, calculated with the aid of (7.31). By eye, one can see how
the centers of the two pulses are either advanced or delayed as they go through
the absorption medium. In both cases, the pulse that emerges is well within
the envelope of the original pulse propagated forward at c. In the case of the
broadband pulse, the absorption peak eats a hole in the center of the spectrum
as shown in Fig. 7.12, causing the emerging pulse to be distorted in time. The
analysis in this section predicts the center of pulses, whereas to see the shape of
pulses one needs to calculate (7.31).
Figure 7.16 Narrowband pulse
traversing an absorbing medium.
The results for the two pulse durations in Example 7.8 indicate a trend. Su-
perluminal behavior only occurs for long boring pulses. In the case of a single
absorption resonance, this comes with a severe cost of attenuation. Figure 7.15
shows the delay time as a function of pulse duration. As the injected pulse be-
comes more sharply deﬁned in time, the superluminal behavior does not persist.
Sharply deﬁned waveforms (i.e. broadband) cannot propagate superluminally
precisely because much of their bandwidth lies away from the frequencies with
superluminal group delays.
We should mention that superluminal propagation cannot persist for indeﬁ-
nite distances since the medium eventually removes the superluminal spectral
components through absorption (or else adds subluminal spectral components
in the case of ampliﬁcation). This limits the amount that a pulse center can be
advanced—on the scale of the pulse’s own duration.

ing narrowband vs. broadband

plifying slab (green stripe) slightly

7.A Pulse Chirping in a Grating Pair
187
As we saw for the absorption situation the exiting pulse is tiny and resides
well within the original envelope of the pulse propagated forward at speed c, as
depicted in Fig. 7.16. Without the absorbing material in place, the signal would
be detectable just as early. This statement is also true for amplifying media.12
Figure 7.17 shows narrowband and broadband pulses traversing an amplifying
medium. In this case, superluminal behavior occurs for spectra near by but not
on an amplifying resonance. If the pulse is too broadband, its spectrum will be
ampliﬁed, which adds slower components to the overall group delay.
While it may be surprising at ﬁrst to realize that group velocity can become
superluminal, it is to be expected for pulses whose spectra lie in the vicinity of a
medium resonance. Group velocity vg tracks the presence of ﬁeld energy, whether
that energy propagates or is extracted from the medium at a point down stream.
Energy is never transported faster than the universal speed limit c. A detailed
analysis of energy ﬂow is given in Appendix 7.B.
Appendix 7.A
Pulse Chirping in a Grating Pair
Grating pairs can be used to introduce large amounts of dispersion into a light
pulse. Gratings are especially useful for ampliﬁcation of ultrashort laser pulses,
where laser pulses are ﬁrst stretched in time before ampliﬁcation (to prevent
damage to the ampliﬁer) and then compressed back to short duration just before
the experiment (called chirped pulse ampliﬁcation). Diffraction from a grating
causes each k-vector to travel at a different angle. A second grating parallel to the
ﬁrst can realign all of the k-vectors to be parallel to each other. Since laser beams
are not inﬁnitely wide, the light is typically sent through the grating pair twice to
undo the tendency of the different frequency components to become laterally
separated. In the present analysis, we will consider an inﬁnitely wide plane wave
pulse incident upon a grating. The scenario is depicted in Fig. 7.18: A short plane
wave pulse strikes the grating at an angle, and a spreading pulse emerges.
Consider a plane-wave pulse that ricochets between a pair of parallel grating
surfaces. Although different k-vectors point with different angles, they are all
straightened out upon diffracting from the second grating. For simplicity, we will
consider a pulse just before the ﬁrst bounce and just after the second bounce,
even though we are interested in the dispersion that takes place between the
gratings. This allows us to treat the k-vectors as being parallel for purposes of
computing intensity.

short plane-wave pulse diffracting

the left edge of the frame.
Consider a plane wave incident on a grating at an incident angle θi with
respect to the grating normal (aligned with the x-axis in our coordinate system)
as depicted in Fig. 7.19. The plane wave diffracts from the ﬁrst grating at an angle
θr (also referenced from the grating normal). This angle is governed by the grating

Suppose we know the pulse at a point r0 on the ﬁrst grating. Next we choose a
point r0 +∆r on the second grating where we will determine the outgoing pulse.
Since we are considering an inﬁnitely wide plane-wave pulse, it doesn’t matter
where we choose that point as long as it lies on the surface of the second grating.
The waveform will be the same everywhere on the second grating, only with a
different arrival time. For convenience, we might as well take the second point to
be r0 +∆r = r0 +Lˆx as shown in Fig. 7.19.

Causality and Exchange of Energy with the
Medium
As shown in section 7.6, the group delay function is useful for predicting when the
centroid of a light pulse will arrive to a point in space. Since this is only part of the
whole energy story, there is no problem when it becomes superluminal. The overly
rapid appearance of electromagnetic energy at one point and its simultaneous
disappearance at another point merely indicates an exchange of energy between
the electric ﬁeld and the medium.14
We need not be dazzled by a magician who invites the audience to look only
at the ﬁeld energy while energy transfers into and out of the ‘unwatched’ domain
of the medium. Extra ﬁeld energy seems to appear ‘prematurely’ downstream
only if there is already non-zero ﬁeld energy downstream to stimulate a transfer
of energy from the medium. The actual transport of energy is strictly bounded by
c; superluminal propagation of a sharp signal front is impossible.
In accordance with Poynting’s theorem (2.51), the total energy density stored
in an electromagnetic ﬁeld and in a medium is given by
u(r,t) = uﬁeld (r,t)+umed(r,t)+u (r,−∞)

stored in the medium before the arrival of any pulse (important in the case of an
amplifying medium). uﬁeld(r,t) and umed(r,t) are both zero before the arrival of
the pulse (i.e. at t = −∞). In addition, uﬁeld(r,t), given by (2.53), returns to zero
after the pulse has passed (i.e. at t = +∞).
As umed increases, the energy in the medium increases. Conversely, as umed
decreases, the medium surrenders energy to the electromagnetic ﬁeld. While it is
possible for umed to become negative, the combination umed +u (−∞) (i.e. the net
energy in the medium) can never go negative since a material cannot surrender
more energy than it posesses to begin with.
Poynting’s theorem (2.51) has the form of a continuity equation which when
integrated spatially over a small volume V yields

(7.65)
where the left-hand side has been transformed into an surface integral (via the
divergence theorem (0.11)) representing the power leaving the volume. Let the
volume be small enough to take S to be uniform throughout V .
We can deﬁne an energy transport velocity (directed along S) as the effective
speed at which all of the energy density would need to travel in order to achieve
the Poynting ﬂux:
vE ≡S
u
(7.66)
Note that this ratio of the Poynting ﬂux to the energy density has units of velocity.
When the total energy density u is used in computing (7.66), the energy transport
velocity has a ﬁctitious nature; it is not the actual velocity of the total energy
(since part is stationary), but rather the effective velocity necessary to achieve
the same energy transport that the electromagnetic ﬂux alone delivers. If we
reduce the denominator to the subset of the energy that can move, namely uﬁeld,
the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality (i.e. α2 +β2 ≥2αβ) ensures an energy transport
velocity vE remains strictly bounded by the speed of light in vacuum c. The total
energy density u is at least as great as the ﬁeld energy density uﬁeld. Hence, this
strict luminality is maintained.

where we have assumed that the volume for the integration encloses all energy in
the system and that the ﬁeld near the edges of this volume is zero. Since we have
included all energy, Poynting’s theorem (2.51) can be written with no source terms
(i.e. ∇·S+∂u/∂t = 0). This means that the total energy in the system is conserved
and is given by the integral in the denominator of (7.68). This allows the derivative
to be brought out in front of the entire expression giving
〈vE〉= ∂〈r〉
∂t
where
〈r〉≡

(7.69)
The latter expression represents the ‘center-of-mass’ or centroid of the total en-
ergy in the system, which is guaranteed to evolve strictly luminally since vE is
everywhere luminal.15
It is enlightening to consider umed within a frequency-domain context. In an
isotropic medium, the polarization for an individual plane wave can be written in
terms of the linear susceptibility deﬁned in (2.16):
P(r,ω) = ϵ0χ(r,ω)E(r,ω)
(7.70)
We can use this to express umed in terms of the electric ﬁeld and material suscepti-
bility.

While Scott Glasgow does not have an
entry in Wikipedia, the authors of this
book think he is a great guy. Prof. Glas-
gow teaches mathematics at Brigham
Young University. He worked out the
analysis presented in this appendix, in-
cluding the fact that a linear medium
responds to the instantaneous spectrum,
which explains within the framework of
a spectral analysis why a medium treats
the front and back of a pulse dierently.
Prof. Glasgow is a competitive weight

Expressing umed in terms of the power spectrum

15Although (7.69) guarantees that the centroid of the total energy moves strictly luminally, there is
no such limitation on the centroid of ﬁeld energy alone. The steps leading to (7.69) are not possible
if uﬁeld is used in place of u. Explicitly, that is

As was pointed out, the left-hand side is strictly luminal. However, the right-hand side can easily
exceed c as the medium exchanges energy with the ﬁeld. In an amplifying medium, for example, the
rapid appearance of a pulse downstream can occur when the leading portion of a pulse stimulates
energy already present in the medium to convert to the form of ﬁeld energy. Group velocity is
related to this method of accounting, which is why it also can become superluminal.
16We assume that the real forms of the ﬁelds in the time domain are used for the sake of this
multiplication.

the symmetry (7.29) along with
P∗(r,ω) = P(r,−ω)
and
χ∗(r,ω) = χ(r,−ω).
Then we obtain

The expression (7.75) describes the net energy density transfered to a point
in the medium after all action has ﬁnished (i.e. at t = ∞). It involves the power
spectrum of the pulse. We can modify this formula in an intuitive way so that it
describes the transfer of energy density to the medium for any time during the
pulse.
Since the medium is unable to anticipate the spectrum of the entire pulse
before experiencing it, the material responds to the pulse according to the history
of the ﬁeld up to each instant. In particular, the material has to be prepared for
the possibility of an abrupt cessation of the pulse at any moment, in which case
all exchange of energy with the medium immediately ceases. In this extreme sce-
nario, there is no possibility for the medium to recover from previously incorrect
attenuation or ampliﬁcation, so it must have gotten it right already.
If the pulse were in fact to abruptly terminate at a given instant, it would
not be necessary to integrate the inverse Fourier transform (7.19) beyond the
termination time t after which all contributions are zero. Causality requires that
the medium be indifferent to whether a pulse actually terminates if that possibility
lies in the future. Therefore, (7.75) can apply for any time t (not just for t = ∞)
if the spectrum (7.19) is evaluated just for that portion of the ﬁeld previously
experienced by the medium (up to time t).
The following is then an exact representation for the energy density (7.64)
transferred to the medium:

This time dependence enters only through Et (r,ω)·E∗

Figure 7.20 Real and imaginary
parts of the refractive index for an
amplifying medium.
The expression (7.76) gives physical insight into the manner in which causal
dielectric materials exchange energy with different parts of an electromagnetic
pulse. Since the function Et (ω) is the Fourier transform of the pulse truncated
at the current time t and set to zero thereafter, it can include many frequency
components that are not present in the pulse taken in its entirety. This explains
why the medium can respond differently to the front of a pulse compared to the
back. Even though absorption or ampliﬁcation resonances may lie outside of
the spectral envelope of a pulse taken in its entirety, the instantaneous spectrum
on a portion of the pulse can momentarily lap onto or off of resonances in the
medium.
In view of (7.76) and (7.77) it is straightforward to predict when the electro-
magnetic energy of a pulse will exhibit superluminal or subluminal behavior. In
section 7.5, we saw that this behavior is controlled by the group velocity function.
However, in (7.76) and (7.77), we see that it is also predictable from the imaginary
part of the susceptibility χ(r,ω).
If the entire pulse passing through point r has a spectrum in the neighborhood
of an amplifying resonance, but not on the resonance, superluminal behavior
can result. The instantaneous spectrum during the front portion of the pulse is
generally wider and can therefore lap onto the nearby gain peak. The medium
accordingly ampliﬁes this perceived spectrum, and the front of the pulse grows.
The energy is then returned to the medium from the latter portion of the pulse
as the instantaneous spectrum narrows and withdraws from the gain peak. The
effect is not only consistent with the principle of causality, it is a direct and general
consequence of causality as demonstrated by (7.76) and (7.77).

rowband pulse traversing an am-
plifying medium off resonance.
The black dot shows the move-
ment of the center of all energy.
The red line inside the medium
shows the energy held in that
medium, which cannot go nega-
tive. The lower ﬁgure shows the
instantaneous spectrum of the
pulse at the front of the medium
relative to the narrow amplifying
resonance.
As an illustration, consider the broadband waveform with T2 = γ−1/
p
2 de-
scribed in Example 7.8. Consider an amplifying medium with index shown in
Fig. 7.20 with the amplifying resonance (negative oscillator strength) set on the
frequency ω0 = ˜ω0 +2γ, where ˜ω0 is the carrier frequency. Thus, the resonance
structure is centered a modest distance above the carrier frequency, and there is
only minor spectral overlap between the pulse and the resonance structure.
Fig. 7.21 shows how the early portion of a pulse has a wide instantaneous
spectrum computed by (7.77) that laps onto the amplifying resonance. As the
wings grow and access the neighboring resonance, the pulse extracts more energy
from the medium. As the wings diminish, the pulse surrenders much of that
energy back to the medium, which shifts the center of the pulse forward producing
a superluminal effect.
In this appendix we have indirectly proven that a sharply deﬁned signal edge
cannot propagate faster than c. If a signal edge begins abruptly at time t0, the
instantaneous spectrum Et(ω) clearly remains identically zero until that time. In

194
Chapter 7 Superposition of Quasi-Parallel Plane Waves
other words, no energy may be exchanged with the medium until the ﬁeld energy
from the pulse arrives. Since, as was pointed out in connection with (7.66), the
Cauchy-Schwartz inequality prevents the ﬁeld energy from traveling faster than c,
at no point in the medium can a signal front exceed c.
Appendix 7.C
Kramers-Kronig Relations
In the late 1920s, of Hendrik Kramers and Ralph Kronig independently discovered
a remarkable relationship between the real and imaginary parts of a material’s
susceptibility χ(ω). Recall that the susceptibility as deﬁned in (2.16) relates the
polarization of a material to the ﬁeld that stimulates the medium:
P(ω) = ϵ0χ(ω)E(ω)
(7.78)
They made an argument based on causality (i.e. effect cannot precede cause),
which allows one to obtain the real part of χ(ω) from the imaginary part of χ(ω),
if it is known for all ω. Similarly, one can obtain the imaginary part of χ(ω) from
the real part of χ(ω). We develop the Kramers-Kronig formulas below.17
We can replace E(ω) in (7.78) with the Fourier transform of E(t) in accordance
with (7.19). In addition, we take the inverse Fourier transform (7.19) of both sides
of (7.78) and obtain

at future times t′ > t. Therefore the expression in square
brackets must be identically zero unless t −t′ > 0. This places a restriction on the
functional form of χ(ω) as we shall see.

lowing integral formula:18

18This integral, which is a speciﬁc instance of Cauchy’s theorem, is tricky because it involves two
diverging pieces, to either side of the singularity ω = ω′. The divergences have opposite sign so that
they cancel. The integration must approach the singularity in the same manner from either side, in
which case the result is called the principal value. In practical terms, if the integral is performed
numerically, the sampling of points should straddle the singularity symmetrically; other sampling
schemes can change the result dramatically, which is incorrect.

relations to generate the imaginary part, and visa versa. We see that the real and
imaginary parts of χ cannot be chosen independently, if we are to respect the
principle of causality.

One can use the Kramers-Kronig relations to ﬁnd the real part of the index from
a measurement of absorption, if the measurement is done over a broad enough
range of the spectrum. This is the most useful form of the Kramers-Kronig rela-
tions.
It is sometimes convenient to multiply the numerator and denominator inside
the integrands of (7.88) by ω′ + ω. Then noting that n is an even function and
κ is an odd function allows us to dismiss either ω′ or ω in the numerator and
integrate21 over positive frequencies only:

20This follows from Cauchy’s theorem since the index (subtract one) is the square root of χ(ω).
The Kramers-Kronig relations for χ(ω) guarantee that χ(ω) has no poles in the upper half complex
plane, when ω is considered (for mathematical purposes) to be a complex variable. Taking the
square root does not introduce poles into the upper half plane.
21The integrals (7.88) and (7.89) diverge to either side of ω′ = ω, but with opposite sign. Again,
the principal value of the integral is required, which means a numeric grid should straddle the
singularity symetrically.

Exercises for 7.A Pulse Chirping in a Grating Pair
P7.12
A Gaussian pulse with T = 20 fs is incident with θi = 20◦on a grating
pair with groove separation d = 0.833 µm. What grating separation L
will lead to a pulse duration of T = 100 ps? Assume two passes through
the grating pair for a total effective separation of 2L. Take the pulse
carrier frequency to corresponds to λ0 = 800 nm.


Chapter 8
Coherence Theory
Coherence theory is the study of correlations that exist between different parts
of a light ﬁeld. Temporal coherence indicates a correlation between ﬁelds offset
in time, E(r,t) and E(r,t −τ). Spatial coherence has to do with correlations be-
tween ﬁelds at different spatial locations, E(r,t) and E(r +∆r,t). Because light
oscillations are too fast to resolve directly, we usually need to study optical co-
herence using interference techniques. In these techniques, light from different
times or places in the light ﬁeld are brought together at a detection point. If
the two ﬁelds have a high degree of coherence, they consistently interfere either
constructively or destructively at the detection point. If the two ﬁelds are not
coherent, the interference at the detection point rapidly ﬂuctuates between con-
structive and destructive interference, so that a time-averaged signal does not
show interference.
You are probably already familiar with two instruments that measure coher-
ence: the Michelson interferometer, which measures temporal coherence, and
Young’s two-slit interferometer, which measures spatial coherence. Your pre-
liminary understanding of these instruments was probably gained in terms of
single-frequency plane waves, which are perfectly coherent for all separations in
time and space. In this chapter, we build on that foundation and derive descrip-
tions that are appropriate when light with imperfect coherence is sent through
these instruments. We also discuss a practical application known as Fourier spec-
troscopy (Section 8.4) which allows us to measure the spectrum of light using a
Michelson interferometer rather than a grating spectrometer.

ter.
A Michelson interferometer employs a 50:50 beamsplitter to divide an initial
beam into two identical beams and then delays one beam with respect to the
other before bringing them back together (see Fig. 8.1). Depending on the relative
path difference d (roundtrip by our convention) between the two arms of the
system, the light can interfere constructively or destructively in the direction of
the detector. The relative path difference d introduces a time delay τ, deﬁned by

Figure 8.2 The intensity seen at
the detector of a Michelson inter-
ferometer with a plane-wave input.
Because the plane wave is coher-
ent over an inﬁnite distance, the
output oscillates without dimin-
ishing as the delay τ is adjusted
in either direction. When the in-
tensity at the detector is zero, all
of the light is reﬂected back to the
source.
If the input light is a plane-wave, the net ﬁeld at the detector consists of the
ﬁeld coming from one arm of the interferometer E0ei(kz−ωt) added to the ﬁeld
coming from the other arm E0ei(kz−ω(t−τ)). These two ﬁelds are identical except
for the delay τ. The intensity seen at the detector as a function of path difference
is computed to be

0 is the intensity from one beam alone (when the other arm of
the interferometer is blocked). This formula is probably familiar. It describes how
the intensity at the detector oscillates between zero and four times the intensity
from one beam,1 as plotted in Fig. 8.2.
When light containing a continuous band of frequencies is sent through
the interferometer, (8.1) no longer holds. Instead of repeating indeﬁnitely, the
oscillations at the detector become less pronounced as τ increases. The concept
of temporal coherence describes how fast fringe visibility diminishes as delay is
introduced in an arm of the Michelson interferometer. The less coherent the
light source, the faster the fringes die out as the delay τ increases. To model this
behavior, we need to expand our analysis beyond (8.1).
Consider an arbitrary waveform E(t) (comprised of many frequency compo-
nents) that has traveled through the ﬁrst arm of a Michelson interferometer to
arrive at the detector in Fig. 8.1. The beam that travels through the second arm
of the interferometer is identical, but delayed by the round-trip delay τ: E(t −τ).
The total ﬁeld at the detector is the sum of these two ﬁelds:
Etot(t,τ) = E(t)+E(t −τ)
(8.2)
The total intensity Itot at the detector is found using (7.21) (with n = 1):

As a reminder, the function I(t) = cϵ0
2 E(t)·E∗(t) corresponds to the intensity
of ﬁrst beam at the detector when the second arm of the interferometer is blocked.
1Keep in mind that if a 50:50 beam splitter is used, then the intensity arriving to the detector
from one arm alone (with other arm blocked) is one fourth of the original beam, since the light
meets the beam splitter twice.

8.1 Michelson Interferometer
203
The rapid oscillations of the light are automatically averaged away in I(t) since
we used (7.21), but the slowly varying envelope of the arbitrary pulse is retained.
The intensity of the combined beams Itot (t,τ) varies with t and also depends on
the path delay τ.
Albert Abraham Michelson (1852
1931, United States) was born in
Poland, but he immigrated to the US
with his parents and grew up in the
rough mining towns of California and
Nevada where his father was a mer-
chant. Michelson attended high school
in San Fransisco. He entered the US
Naval Academy in 1869 (with inter-
vention from US President Grant after
Michelson pleaded his case when the
president was walking near the White
House). After two years at sea, Michel-
son returned to the Naval Academy to
teach physics and mathematics for sev-
eral years. Michelson was fascinated by
the problem of determining the speed
of light, and developed successive exper-
iments to measure it more accurately.
He is probably most famous for his ex-
periment conducted at Case School of
Applied Science in Cleveland with Ed-
ward Morley to detect the motion of
the earth through the ether. Michelson
later was a professor at the University of
Chicago and then at Caltech. In 1907,
he became the rst American to win the
Nobel prize, for his contributions to op-
tics. Michelson married late in life and
was the father of four. (Wikipedia)
We consider I(t) to be a pulse with a ﬁnite duration. We will be interested
in the total amount of energy (per area) that the pulse deposits on a detector.2
The detected signal, which we’ll denote by Sig(τ), is the time-integrated intensity,
called ﬂuence in units of energy per area:
Sig(τ) ∝
∞
Z
−∞
Itot (t,τ)dt
(8.4)
The proportionality accounts for the calibration of the detector, which might
report in volts or current, etc. The ﬂuence arriving at the detector is sensitive
to the delay τ between the arms of the interferometer. Presumably, we can
repeatedly send identical pulses into the interferometer and record Sig(τ) for
many different delays τ. We can manipulate the ﬂuence integral in (8.4) into a
more useful form that will make the coherence properties more evident.
Manipulation of the ﬂuence integral

simpliﬁes to

2For sub-nanosecond laser pulses, a detector automatically integrates the entire energy of the
pulse since a detector cannot keep up with temporal variations on such a rapid time scale.
3Note that the second integral is insensitive to τ since a change of variables t′ = t −τ converts it
into the ﬁrst integral.

ferometer does not depend on the phase of E(ω). It depends only on the amount
of light associated with each frequency through I (ω) ≡ϵ0c
2 E(ω)·E∗(ω).
Alternate derivation of (8.9)
We could have derived (8.9) using another strategy, which may seem more intuitive
than the approach above. Equation (8.1) gives the intensity at the detector when a
single plane wave of frequency ω goes through the interferometer. Now suppose
that a waveform composed of many frequencies is sent through the interferometer.
The intensity associated with each frequency acts independently, obeying (8.1)
individually.
The total energy (per area) accumulated at the detector is then a linear superposi-
tion of the spectral intensities of all frequencies present:
∞
Z
−∞
Itot (ω,τ)dω =
∞
Z
−∞
2I (ω)[1+cos(ωτ)]dω
(8.11)
While this procedure may seem obvious, the fact that we can do it is remarkable!
Remember that it is usually the ﬁelds that we must add together before ﬁnding the
intensity of the resulting superposition. The formula (8.11) with its superposition
of intensities relies on the fact that the different frequencies inside the interferom-
eter when time-averaged (over all time) do not interfere. Certainly, the ﬁelds at
different frequencies do interfere (or beat in time). However, they constructively
interfere as often as they destructively interfere, and in a time-averaged picture it
is as though the individual frequency components transmit independently. Again,
in writing (8.11) we considered the light to be pulsed rather than continuous so
that the integrals converge.
We can manipulate (8.11) as follows:

Figure 8.3 shows this signal for a given T . As delay is added (or subtracted), the
output signal oscillates. Eventually enough delay is introduced such that the
very short pulses no longer interfere (arriving sequentially), and the output signal
becomes steady.
8.2
Coherence Time and Fringe Visibility
The degree of coherence function γ(τ) describes the oscillations in intensity
at the detector as the mirror in one arm of the interferometer is moved. The
5Technically, the output intensity is one fourth this, but our calculation of the degree of coher-
ence is insensitive to amplitude.

206
Chapter 8 Coherence Theory
real part of γ(τ) is analogous to cos(ωτ) in (8.1). However, for large delays τ,
the oscillations tend to die off as different frequencies get out of sync—some
interfere constructively, while others interfere destructively. Narrowband light is
temporally more coherent than broadband light because there is less opportunity
for frequencies to get out of sync. Still, for large path differences, the oscillations
eventually die off, and the time-integrated intensity at the detector then remains
steady as the mirror is moved further.
The coherence time τc is the amount of delay necessary to cause γ(τ) to quit
oscillating (i.e. its amplitude approaches zero). This deﬁnition is not very precise,
since the oscillations do not usually have an abrupt end, but instead slowly die off
as τ increases. A useful (although arbitrary) analytic deﬁnition for the coherence
time is
τc ≡

£
Sig(τ)
¤
refers to the detector signal when the mirror is positioned such that
the amount of throughput to the detector is a local minimum. The minimum
and the maximum don’t occur at exactly the same τ, but the difference in τ is
only about half an optical period. As the mirror moves a large distance from the
equal-path-length position, the oscillations in Sig(τ) become less pronounced
as the max and min tend to the same value, and the fringe visibility goes to zero
when γ(τ) = 0. It is left as an exercise (see P8.1) to show that the fringe visibility
can be written simply as6
V (τ) =
¯¯γ(τ)
¯¯
(8.16)
Note that the fringe visibility depends only upon the frequency content of the
light without regard to whether the frequency components are organized into a
short pulse or a longer time pattern.

Solution: By (8.16), the fringe visibility is
V (τ) =
¯¯γ(τ)
¯¯ = e−τ2

This is shown as the dashed line in Fig. 8.4. As expected, the fringe visibility dies
off as delay τ gets farther from the origin (i.e. where the interferometer arms are
equidistant). From (8.13) the coherence time is

which is the delay necessary to cause the fringes to substantially diminish.
8.3
Temporal Coherence of Continuous Sources
Consider a continuous light source such as starlight or a continuous wave (CW)
laser. The integral
R ∞
−∞I(t)dt diverges for such a source, since it is on forever
(or at least for a very long time) and emits inﬁnite (or very much) total energy.
The concept of ﬂuence (i.e. total energy) in this case is not very useful. However,
note that the integrals on both sides of (8.5) diverge in the same way. We can
renormalize (8.5) in this case by replacing the integrals on each side with the
average value of the intensity:
Iave ≡〈I(t)〉t = 1
T
T /2
Z
−T /2
I(t)dt
(continuous source) (8.17)
The duration T must be large enough to average over any ﬂuctuations that are
present in the light source.
For a continuous light source, the signal at the detector (8.9) becomes
Sig(τ) ∝2〈I(t)〉t
£
1+Reγ(τ)
¤
(continuous source) (8.18)
Although technically the integrals used in (8.10) to compute γ(τ) also diverge in
the case of continuous light, the numerator and the denominator diverge in the
same way. Therefore, we may renormalize I (ω) in a similar fashion to deal with
this problem. The units in the numerator and denominator cancel so that γ(τ)
always remains dimensionless. Once we have the degree of coherence function
γ(τ), we can calculate the coherence time and fringe visibility just as we did for
pulsed sources.

Chapter 8 Coherence Theory
Given a measurement of Sig(τ), we might like to ﬁnd the power spectrum I(ω)
that gave it. Unfortunately, I(ω) is buried within an integral in (8.19). However,
since the integral looks like an inverse Fourier transform of I(ω), we will be able
to extract the desired spectrum with a bit of work. This procedure for extracting
I(ω) from an interferometric measurement is known as Fourier spectroscopy.7

The Fourier transform of the measured signal is seen to contain three terms, one
of which is the power spectrum I (ω) that we are after. Fortunately, when graphed
as a function of ω (shown in Fig. 8.5), the three pieces on the right-hand side
of (8.20) do not overlap. As a reminder, the measured signal as a function of τ
looks something like that in Fig. 8.3. The oscillation frequency of the fringes
lies in the neighborhood of ω0. In summary, to obtain I (ω) using a Michelson
interferometer, 1) record Sig(τ); 2) take its Fourier transform; and 3) extract the
curve at positive frequencies.

Young’s Two-Slit Setup and Spatial Coherence
In close analogy with the Michelson interferometer, which is useful for investi-
gating temporal coherence, a Young’s two-slit setup can be used to investigate
spatial coherence of quasi-monochromatic light. Thomas Young, who lived nearly
a century before Michelson, used his two-slit setup for the ﬁrst conclusive demon-
stration that light propagates as a wave. The Young’s double-slit setup and the
Michelson interferometer have in common that two beams of light travel different
paths and then interfere. In the Michelson interferometer, one path is delayed
with respect to the other so that temporal effects can be studied. In the Young’s
two-slit setup, two laterally separate points of the same wave are compared as
they are sent through two slits.
Depending on the coherence of the light entering each slit, the fringe pattern
observed can exhibit good or poor visibility. Just as the Michelson interferometer
is sensitive to the spectral content of light, the Young’s two-slit setup is sensitive
to the spatial extent of the light source illuminating the two slits. For example, if
light from a distant star (restricted by a ﬁlter to a narrow spectral range) is used to
illuminate a double-slit setup, the resulting interference pattern appearing on a
subsequent screen shows good or poor fringe visibility depending on the angular
width of the star. Michelson was the ﬁrst to use this type of setup to measure the
angular width of stars.
In contrast, light emerging from a single ideal point source has wave fronts
that are spatially uniform in a lateral sense (see Fig. 8.6). Such wave fronts are
said to be spatially coherent, even if the temporal coherence is not perfect (i.e.
if a range of frequencies is present). When spatially coherent light illuminates a
Young’s two-slit setup, fringes of maximum visibility are seen at a distant screen,
meaning the fringes vary between a maximum intensity and zero.
As a warmup exercise, we ﬁrst consider a Young’s two-slit setup illuminated
by a single point source. Let the slits be equidistant from the point source. We
represent the ﬁelds on a subsequent screen that transmit through each slit, re-
spectively, as E0ei(kd1−ωt) and E0ei(kd2−ωt). The two ﬁelds are identical except for
a phase associated with the distance from each slit to a particular point on the

These approximations are valid so long as D ≫y and D ≫h.
We next consider how to modify (8.24) so that it applies to the case when
the two slits are illuminated by a collection of point sources distributed over a
ﬁnite lateral extent. This situation is depicted in Fig. 8.7 and it leads to partial
spatial coherence if the phase of each point emitter ﬂuctuates randomly. When
a Young’s two-slit setup is illuminated by an extended random source, the wave
fronts at the two slits are less correlated. This makes the fringes move around on
the screen rapidly and partially ‘wash out’ when time averaged, meaning worse
fringe visibility.
To simplify our analysis, we restrict the distribution of point sources to vary
only in the y′ dimension.9 We assume that the light is quasi-monochromatic so
9The results can be generalized to a two-dimensional source.

time intervals much longer than the period of oscillation 2π/ω.10
The light emerging from the j th point at y′
j travels by means of two very
narrow slits to a point y on a screen. Let E1(y′
j) and E2(y′
j) be the ﬁelds on the
screen at y, both originating from the point y′
j, but traveling respectively through
the two different slits. We assume that these ﬁelds have the same polarization,
and we will suppress the vectorial nature of the ﬁelds. For simplicity, we assume
the two ﬁelds have the same (real) amplitude at the screen E0(y′
j). Thus, we write
the two ﬁelds as

Thomas Young (17731829, English)
was born in Milverton, Somerset, and
was the oldest of ten children. By age
fourteen, he had become procient at a
dozen dierent languages. As a young
adult, he studied medicine and then
went to Göttingen, Germany where he
earned a doctoral degree in physics. In
1801, he was appointed professor of
natural philosophy at the Royal Insti-
tute, but he also maintained an active
medical practice on the side. He con-
tributed to a wide variety of elds and
helped to decipher ancient Egyptian hi-
eroglyphs, including the Rosetta Stone.
He published descriptions of the heart
and arteries as well as how the eye ac-
commodates to see at dierent depths
and how the eye perceives color. In en-
gineering elds, Young is well known
his analysis of stresses and strains in
elastic media. Young's double-slit exper-
iment gave convincing evidence of the
wave nature of light, overturning New-
ton's corpusculor theory. Regarding this,
Thomas Young traded ideas with Au-
gustin Fresnel through correspondence.
(Wikipedia)
At this juncture we make a critical assumption: the phase of the emission
φ(y′
j) varies in time independently at every point on the source. This is sometimes
called the stochastic assumption, and it is appropriate for the emission from
thermal sources such as starlight (ﬁltered to a narrow frequency range), a glowing
ﬁlament, or spontaneous emission from an excited gas or plasma. However, it is
not appropriate for coherent sources like lasers (more on that in appendix 8.B).
A wonderful simpliﬁcation happens to (8.30) when the phase difference
φ(y′
j)−φ(y′
m) varies randomly. If j ̸= m, then exp{i(φ(y′
j)−φ(y′
m))} time-averages
to zero. On the other hand, if j = m, then the factor reduces to e0 = 1. Formally,
this is written

where δj,m is known as the Kronecker delta function. The time-averaged intensity
under the stochastic assumption (8.31) then reduces to

We can generalize (8.33) so that it applies to the case of a continuous distribu-
tion of light as opposed to a collection of discrete point sources. In Appendix 8.A

deﬁnes the locations of the periodic fringes on the
screen. The rest of (8.36) controls the (more interesting) depth of the fringes as
the slit separation h is varied. When the slit separation h increases, the amplitude
of γ(h) tends to diminish until the intensity at the screen becomes uniform.
When the two slits have very small separation (such that e−i khy′

∼= 1) then we
have
¯¯γ(h)
¯¯ = 1 and very good fringe visibility results. γ(h) dictates the degree of
spatial coherence in much the same way that γ(τ) dictates the degree of temporal
coherence. Notice the close similarity between (8.36) and (8.10).
As the slit separation h increases, the fringe visibility
V (h) =

diminishes, eventually approaching zero (see (8.16)). In analogy to the temporal

Spatial Coherence for a Continuous Spatial

In this appendix we examine the spatial coherence of light from a continuous spa-
tial distribution (as opposed to a collection of discrete point sources) and justify
(8.36) and (8.37). We begin by replacing the summations in (8.30) with integrals

Rather than deal with a time average of randomly varying phases, we will instead
work with a linear superposition of all conceivable phase factors. That is, we will
write the phase φ(y′) as K y′, where K is a parameter with units of inverse length,
which we allow to take on all possible real values with uniform likelihood. The
way we modify (8.31) for the continuous case is then

Hence,
R ∞
−∞I(y′)d y′ is the intensity at the screen caused by the entire extended

(8.36).

(8.44)
where we have employed (8.25) and (8.26) and similar expressions involving R
and y′.
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (8.44) is the intensity on the screen
when the lower slit is covered. The second term is the intensity on the screen
when the upper slit is covered. The last term is the interference term, which
modiﬁes the sum of the individual intensities when light goes through both slits.
Notice the occurrence of Fourier transforms (over position) on the quantities
inside of the square brackets. Later, when we study diffraction theory, we will
recognize these transforms as determining the strength of ﬁelds impinging on
the individual slits. This corresponds to a major difference between a spatially
coherent source and a random-phase source. With the random-phase source, the
slits are always illuminated with the same strength regardless of the separation.
However, with a coherent source, ‘beaming’ can occur such that the strength as
well as phase of the ﬁeld at each slit depends on the slit separation.
A beautiful simpliﬁcation occurs when the phase of the emitted light has the
following distribution:
φ(y′) = −ky′2
2R
(converging spherical wave) (8.45)
Equation (8.45) is not as arbitrary as it may ﬁrst appear. This particular phase
is an approximation to a concave spherical wave front converging to the center
between the two slits. This type of wave front is created when a plane wave passes
through a lens. With the special phase (8.45), the intensity (8.44) reduces to

This may seem rather contrived, but at least it is cute, and it is known as the
van Cittert-Zernike theorem.11 It says that the spatial coherence of an extended
source with randomly varying phase drops off with lateral slit separation in the
same way that the ﬁeld pattern at the focus of a converging spherical wave would
drop off, whose ﬁeld amplitude distribution is the same as the original intensity
distribution.

must rotate rapidly to create random time variation of the phase at
each point as would occur automatically for a natural source such
as a star.) Place the double slit at a distance of R ≈100 cm after the
ﬁrst slit. (Take note of the exact value of R, as you will need it for the
next problem.) Use a lens to image the diffraction pattern that would
have appeared on a far-away screen into a video camera. Observe
the visibility of the fringes. Adjust the width of the source with the
single slit until the visibility of the fringes disappears. After making the
source wide enough to cause the fringe pattern to degrade, measure
the single slit width a by shining a HeNe laser through it and observing
the diffraction pattern on the distant wall. (video)

Problems
R40
Second harmonic generation (the conversion of light with frequency
ω into light with frequency 2ω) can occur when very intense laser
light travels in a material. For energy conversion, the laser light and
the second harmonic light need to travel at the same speed in the
material. In other words, both frequencies need to have the same index
of refraction.
Unfortunately, the index of refraction is almost never the same for
different frequencies in a given material, owing to dispersion. However,
in some crystals when one frequency propagates as an ordinary wave
and the other propagates as an extraordinary wave, the two indices can
be made precisely the same by ‘tuning’ the angle of the crystal.
Consider a uniaxial KDP crystal (potassium dihydrogen phosphate)
with ordinary index no and extraordinary index
none

where θ is the angle made with the optic axis. At the frequency of a
ruby laser, KDP has indices no (ω) = 1.505 and ne (ω) = 1.465. At the
frequency of the second harmonic, the indices are no (2ω) = 1.534 and
ne (2ω) = 1.487.
In order to make the indices at the two frequencies the same, decide
which frequency should propagate as an ordinary wave and which
should propagate as an extraordinary one. What angle θ will make the
indices the same?

Chapter 9
Light as Rays
So far in our study of optics, we have described light in terms of waves, which sat-
isfy Maxwell’s equations. However, as you are probably aware, in many situations
light can be thought of as rays pointing along the direction of wave propagation. A
ray picture is useful when one is interested in the macroscopic ﬂow of light energy,
but rays fail to reveal ﬁne details, in particular wave and diffraction phenomena.
For example, simple ray theory suggests that a lens can focus light down to a point.
However, if a beam of light were concentrated onto a true point, the intensity
would be inﬁnite! Nevertheless, ray theory is useful for predicting where a focus
occurs. It is also useful for describing imaging properties of optical systems (e.g.
lenses and mirrors).
Beginning in section 9.3 we study the details of ray theory and the imaging
properties of optical systems. First, however, we examine the justiﬁcation for ray
theory starting from Maxwell’s equations. In the short-wavelength limit, Maxwell’s
equations give rise to the eikonal equation, which governs the direction of rays
in a medium with an index of refraction that varies with position. The German
word ‘eikonal’ comes from the Greek ‘ϵικων’ from which the modern word ‘icon’
derives. The eikonal equation therefore has a descriptive title since it controls the
formation of images. The eikonal equation provides an adequate description as
long as the features of interest are large compared to a wavelength.
The eikonal equation describes the direction of ray propagation, even in com-
plicated situations such as desert mirages where air is heated near the ground and
has a different index than the air farther from the ground. Rays of light from the
sky that initially are directed toward the ground can be bent such that they travel
parallel to or even up from the ground, owing to the inhomogeneous refractive
index. The eikonal equation can also be used to deduce Fermat’s principle, which
in short says that light travels from point A to point B following a path that takes
the minimum time. This principle can be used, for example, to‘derive’ Snell’s law.
Fermat asserted this principle more than a century before Maxwell’s equations
were known, but it is nice to give justiﬁcation retroactively using the modern
perspective.
Much of this chapter is devoted to the propagation of rays through optical

Chapter 9 Light as Rays
systems composed of lenses and/or curved mirrors in the context of paraxial
ray theory. The paraxial approximation restricts rays to travel nearly parallel to
the axis of such systems. We consider the effects of three basic optical elements
acting on paraxial rays: 1) Free propagation through a distance d in a uniform
medium; a ray may move farther away from (or closer to) the optical axis, as it
travels. 2) Reﬂection from a curved spherical mirror, which changes a ray’s angle
with respect to the optical axis. 3) Transmission through a spherical interface
between two materials with differing refractive indices. The effects of each of
these basic elements on a ray of light can be represented as a 2×2 matrix, which
can be multiplied together to construct more complex imaging systems (such as
a lens or a series of lenses and curved mirrors).
Sir Isaac Newton (16431727, En-
glish) was born in Lincolnshire, England
three months after the death of his fa-
ther who was a farmer. Newton spent
much of his childhood with his ma-
ternal grandmother, after his mother
remarried. (Newton did not like his step-
father.) In his teenage years, Newton's
mother tried to persuade him to take
up farming, but his love for education
won out. He became the top-ranked
student at his school and was admit-
ted into Trinity College, Cambridge at
age 18. Newton was inuenced by the
works of Descartes, Copernicus, Galileo,
and Kepler. Upon graduation four years
later, the university closed for two years
because of a plague. Newton's return
to farm life coincided with a remarkable
period when he rst developed ideas on
calculus, gravitation, and optics. New-
ton later returned to Cambridge where
he spent his extraordinarily prolic ca-
reer and became the rst scientist to be
knighted. In optics, Newton advanced
the ray theory of light and image for-
mation. He wrote a landmark textbook
on the subject. He also showed that
`white' light is comprised of many colors
and that the amount of refraction de-
pends on color. He built the rst reect-
ing telescope, which avoids chromatic
aberration. Newton advocated against
the wave theory of light in favor of his
`corpuscular' theory. (Imagining that
Newton foresaw the quantized nature
of light energy gives too much credit!)

We will study image formation in the context of the paraxial approximation,
which in the case of a curved mirror or a thin lens gives rise to the familiar formula
1
f = 1
do
+ 1
di
(9.1)
Even a complicated multi-element optical system obeys (9.1) if do and di are
measured from principal planes rather than the single plane of, for example, a
thin lens.
Paraxial ray theory can also be used to study the stability of laser cavities. The
formalism predicts whether a ray, after many round trips in the cavity, remains
near the optical axis (trapped and therefore stable) or if it drifts endlessly away
from the axis of the cavity on successive round trips.
In appendix 9.A we address deviations from the paraxial ray theory known
as aberrations. We also comment on ray-tracing techniques, used for designing
optical systems that minimize such aberrations.

The Eikonal Equation
For simplicity, consider light consisting of only a single frequency ω. The wave
equation (2.13) for an isotropic medium with a real refractive index may be written
as
∇2E(r,t)+ [n (r)]2 ω2
c2
E(r,t) = 0
(9.2)
where we have already performed the time differentiation on the assumed single-
frequency time dependence e−iωt. Although in chapter 2 we considered solutions
to the wave equation in a homogeneous material, the wave equation remains valid
when the index of refraction varies throughout space (i.e. if n (r) is an arbitrary
function of r). In this case, the usual plane-wave solutions no longer satisfy the
wave equation.
As a trial solution for (9.2), we take
E(r,t) = E0 (r)ei[kvacR(r)−ωt]
(9.3)

(9.4)
Here R (r) is a real scalar function (which depends on position) having the dimen-
sion of length. By taking R (r) to be real, there is no absorption or ampliﬁcation.
Even though the trial solution (9.3) looks somewhat like a plane wave,1 the func-
tion R (r) accommodates wave fronts that can be curved or distorted as depicted
in Fig. 9.1. At any given instant t, the phase of the curved surfaces described by
R (r) = constant can be interpreted as wave fronts. The wave fronts travel in the
direction for which R (r) varies the fastest. This direction is aligned with ∇R (r),
which lies in the direction perpendicular to surfaces of constant phase.

faces of constant phase given by
R(r)) distributed throughout space

becomes constant (i.e. E0 (r) →E0).

Chapter 9 Light as Rays
Don’t be afraid; at this point we are ready to make an important approxima-
tion. We take the limit of a very short wavelength (i.e. 1/kvac = λvac/2π →0), and
the entire right-hand side of (9.6) vanishes. (Thank goodness!) With it we lose the
effects of diffraction so that only macroscopic features are relevant. The equation
also knows nothing about surface reﬂections at abrupt index changes.
Our wave equation has been simpliﬁed to
[∇R (r)]·[∇R (r)] = [n (r)]2
(9.7)
Written another way, this equation is
∇R (r) = n (r)ˆs(r)

where ˆs is a unit vector pointing in the direction ∇R (r), the direction normal to
wave front surfaces. Equation (9.8) is called the eikonal equation.2

9.2 Fermat’s Principle
231
It can be shown that the Poynting vector is directed along ˆs (see P9.2). In other
words, the direction of ˆs speciﬁes the direction of energy ﬂow. The unit vector ˆs
at each location in space points perpendicular to the wave fronts and indicates
the direction that the waves travel as seen in Fig. 9.1. A collection of vectors ˆs
distributed throughout space are called rays.
In retrospect, we might have jumped straight to (9.8) without going through
the above derivation. After all, we know that each part of a wave front advances
in the direction of its gradient ∇R (r) (i.e. in the direction that R (r) varies most
rapidly). We also know that each part of a wave front deﬁned by R (r) = constant
travels at speed c/n (r). The slower a given part of the wave front advances, the
more rapidly R (r) changes with position r and the closer the contours of constant
phase. It follows that ∇R (r) must be proportional to n (r) since ∇R (r) denotes the
rate of change in R (r).
Pierre de Fermat (16011665, French)
was born in Beaumont-de-Lomagne,
France to a wealthy merchant family.
He attended the University of Toulouse
before moving to Bordeaux in the late
1620s where Fermat distinguished him-
self as a mathematician. Fermat was
procient in many languages and went
on to obtain a law degree in 1631 from
the University of Orleans. He continued
his study of mathematics as a hobby
throughout his life. He corresponded
with a number of notable mathemati-
cians, and through his letters made
notable contributions to analytic ge-
ometry, probability theory, and number
theory. He was often quite secretive
about the methods used to obtain his
results. Mathematicians suspect that
Fermat didn't actually prove his famous
last theorem, which was not able to be
veried until the 1990's. Fermat was
the rst to assert that the path taken
by a beam of light is the one that can
be traveled in the least amount of time.
(Wikipedia)
9.2
Fermat’s Principle
As we have seen, the eikonal equation (9.8) governs the path that rays follow as
they traverse a region of space, where the index varies with position. Another way
of deducing the correct path of rays is via Fermat’s principle.3 Fermat’s principle
says that if a ray happens to travel through both points A and B, it will follow a
path between them that takes the least time.
Derivation of Fermat’s Principle from the Eikonal Equation
We begin by taking the curl of (9.8) to obtain4
∇×[n (r)ˆs(r)] = ∇×[∇R (r)] = 0
(9.9)
This can be integrated over an open surface of area A to give
Z
A
∇×[n (r)ˆs(r)]da =
I
C
n (r)ˆs(r)·dℓ= 0
(9.10)
We have applied Stokes’ theorem (0.12) to convert the area integral into a path
integral around the perimeter contour C.
Equation (9.10) states that the integration of nˆs·dℓaround a closed loop is always
zero. If we consider a closed loop comprised of a path from point A to point B and
then a different path from B back to A again, the integrals for the two legs always
cancel, even while holding one path ﬁxed while varying the other. This means
B
Z
A
nˆs·dℓ
is independent of path from A to B.
(9.11)
Now consider a path from A to B that is parallel to ˆs, as depicted in Fig. 9.3. In
this case, the cosine in the dot product is always one. If we choose some other
3M. Born and E. Wolf, Principles of Optics, 7th ed., Sect. 3.3.2 (Cambridge University Press, 1999).

232
Chapter 9 Light as Rays
path that connects A and B, the cosine associated with the dot product is less than
one at most points along that path, whereas the result of the integral is the same.
Therefore, if we artiﬁcially remove the dot product from the integral (i.e. exclude
the cosine factor), the result of the integral will exceed the true value unless the
path chosen follows the direction of ˆs (i.e. the path that corresponds to the one
that light rays actually follow).
In mathematical form, this argument can be expressed as

The integral on the right is called the optical path length (OPL) between points A
and B:

(9.13)
The conclusion is that the true path that light follows between two points (i.e.
the one that stays parallel to ˆs) is the one with the shortest optical path length.
The index n may vary with position and therefore can be different for each of the
incremental distances dℓ.

point A arriving at B.
Fermat’s principle is usually stated in terms of the time it takes light to travel
between points. The travel time ∆t depends not only on the path taken by the
light but also on the velocity of the light v (r), which varies spatially with the
refractive index:

(9.14)
To ﬁnd the correct path for the light ray that leaves point A and crosses point
B, we need only minimize the optical path length between the two points (pro-
portional to travel time). The optical path length is not the actual distance that
the light travels; it is proportional to the number of wavelengths that ﬁt into that
distance (see (2.24)). Thus, as the wavelength shortens due to a higher index of
refraction, the optical path length increases. The correct ray traveling from A to
B does not necessarily follow a straight line but can follow a complicated curve
according to how the index varies.
An imaging situation occurs when many paths from point A to point B have
the same optical path length. An example of this occurs when a lens causes an
image to form. In this case all rays leaving point A (on an object) and traveling
through the system to point B (on the image) experience equal optical path
lengths. Although the ray traveling through the center of the lens depicted in
Fig. 9.4 has a shorter geometric path length, it goes through more material so that
the optical path length is the same as for the outer rays.

a point A, the ray that crosses a second point B is the one that follows the shortest
optical path length. If many rays tie for having the shortest optical path, we say
that an image of point A forms at point B.

Example 9.2
Use Fermat’s principle to derive Snell’s law.
Solution: Consider the many rays of light that leave point A seen in Fig. 9.5. Only
one of the rays passes through point B. Within each medium we expect the light to
travel in a straight line since the index is uniform. However, at the boundary we
must allow for bending since the index changes.
The optical path length between points A and B may be written

We need to minimize this optical path length to ﬁnd the correct one according to

Since points A and B are ﬁxed, we may regard xi and xt as constants. The distances
yi and yt are not constants although the combination
ytot = yi + yt

is constant. Thus, we may rewrite (9.15) as

Use Fermat’s principle to derive the equation of curvature for a reﬂective surface
that causes all rays leaving one point to image to another. Do the calculation in
two dimensions rather than in three.6
Solution: We adopt the convention that the origin is half way between the points,
which are separated by a distance 2a, as shown in Fig. 9.6. If the points are to image
to each other, Fermat’s principle requires that the total path length be a constant;
call it b. If the total path from the ‘object’ point to the ‘image’ point includes a

Paraxial Rays and ABCD Matrices
We now turn our attention to the effects of curved mirrors and lenses on rays of
light. Keep in mind that when describing light as a collection of rays rather than
as waves, the results can only describe features that are macroscopic compared to
a wavelength. The rays of light at each location in space describe approximately
the direction of travel of the wave fronts at that location. Since the wavelength of
visible light is extraordinarily small compared to the macroscopic features that we

Fig. 9.6 represents the end of an ampliﬁer rod while the other represents the end of a thin ﬂash-lamp
tube.

9.3 Paraxial Rays and ABCD Matrices
235
perceive in our day-to-day world, the ray approximation is often a very good one.
This is the reason that ray optics was developed long before light was understood
as a wave.
We consider ray theory within the paraxial approximation, meaning that
we restrict our attention to rays that are near and almost parallel to an optical
axis of a system, say the z-axis. It is within this approximation that the familiar
imaging properties of lenses occur. An image occurs when all rays from a point
on an object converge to a corresponding point on what is referred to as the
image. To the extent that the paraxial approximation is violated, the clarity of
an image can suffer, and we say that there are aberrations present. The ﬁeld
of optical engineering is often concerned with minimizing aberrations in cases
where the paraxial approximation is not strictly followed. This is done so that, for
example, a camera can take pictures of objects that occupy a fairly wide angular
ﬁeld of view, where rays violate the paraxial approximation. Optical systems are
typically engineered using the science of ray tracing, which is described brieﬂy in
section 9.A.
As we develop paraxial ray theory, we should remember that rays impinging
on devices such as lenses or curved mirrors should strike the optical component
at near normal incidence. To quantify this statement, the paraxial approximation
is valid to the extent that
sinθ ∼= θ
(9.23)
is a good approximation, and similarly
tanθ ∼= θ
(9.24)
Here, the angle θ (in radians) represents the angle that a particular ray makes
with respect to the optical axis. There is an important mathematical reason for
this approximation. The sine is a nonlinear function, but at small angles it is
approximately linear and can be represented by its argument. This linearity
greatly simpliﬁes the analysis since it reduces the problem to linear algebra.
Conveniently, we will be able to keep track of imaging effects with a 2×2 matrix
formalism.
Figure 9.7 The behavior of a ray as
light traverses a distance d.
Consider a ray propagating in the y–z plane where the optical axis is in the z-
direction. Let us specify a ray at position z1 by two coordinates: the displacement
from the axis y1 and the orientation angle θ1 (see Fig. 9.7). If the index is uniform
everywhere, the ray travels along a straight path. It is straightforward to predict the
coordinates of the same ray downstream, say at z2. First, since the ray continues
in the same direction, we have
θ2 = θ1
(9.25)
By referring to Fig. 9.7 we can write y2 in terms of y1 and θ1:
y2 = y1 +d tanθ1
(9.26)
where d ≡z2 −z1. Equation (9.26) is nonlinear in θ1, but within the paraxial
approximation it becomes simply
y2 = y1 +θ1d
(9.27)

Here, the vectors in this equation specify the essential information about the ray

traversing the distance. This type of matrix is called an ABCD matrix;7 sometimes
physicists are not very inventive with names.
Example 9.4
Let the distance d be subdivided into two distances, a and b, such that d = a +
b. Show that an application of the ABCD matrix for distance a followed by an

Reﬂection and Refraction at Curved Surfaces
We next consider the effect of reﬂection from a spherical surface as depicted in
Fig. 9.8. We consider only the act of reﬂection without considering propagation
before or after the reﬂection takes place. Thus, the incident and reﬂected rays
in the ﬁgure are symbolic only of the direction of propagation before and after
reﬂection; they do not indicate any amount of travel. We immediately write
y2 = y1
(9.32)
since the ray has no chance to go anywhere.
7P. W. Milonni and J. H. Eberly, Lasers, Sect. 14.2 (New York: Wiley, 1988).

9.4 Reﬂection and Refraction at Curved Surfaces
237
We adopt the widely used convention that, upon reﬂection, the positive z-
direction is reoriented so that we consider the rays still to travel in the positive
z sense. An easy way to remember this is that the positive z direction is always
taken to be down stream of where the light is headed. Notice that in Fig. 9.8, the
reﬂected ray approaches the z-axis. In this case θ2 is a negative angle (as opposed
to θ1 which is drawn as a positive angle) and is equal to
θ2 = −(θ1 +2θi)
(9.33)
where θi is the angle of incidence with respect to the normal to the spherical
mirror surface. By the law of reﬂection, the incident and reﬂected ray both occur
at an angle θi, referenced to the surface normal. The surface normal points
towards the center of curvature of the mirror surface, which we assume is on the
z-axis a distance R away. By convention, the radius of curvature R is positive if
the mirror surface is concave and negative if the mirror surface is convex.
Figure 9.8 A ray depicted in the
act of reﬂection from a spherical
surface.
Elimination of θi from (9.33) in favor of θ1 and y1
By inspection of Fig. 9.8 we can write
y1
R = sinφ ∼= φ
(9.34)
where we have applied the paraxial approximation (9.23). (The angles in Fig. 9.8
are exaggerated. In fact, when φ is small enough for (9.34) to hold, we may also
neglect the small distance δ.) By inspection of the geometry, we also have
φ = θ1 +θi
(9.35)
and when this is combined with (9.34), we get
θi = y1

(9.36)
With this we are able to put (9.33) into a useful linear form:
θ2 = −2

ABCD matrix for a curved mirror
(9.38)
The ABCD matrix in this transformation describes the act of reﬂection from a
concave mirror with radius of curvature R. As noted, the radius R is negative
when the mirror is convex.
The ﬁnal basic element that we shall consider is a spherical interface between
two materials with indices ni and nt (see Fig. 9.9). This has an effect similar to
that of the curved mirror, which changes the direction of a ray without altering

238
Chapter 9 Light as Rays
its distance y1 from the optical axis. Please note that here the radius of curvature
is considered to be positive for a convex surface (opposite convention from that
of the mirror). In this way, if the lower index is on the left, a positive radius R for
the interface tends to deﬂect rays towards the axis just as a positive radius for a
mirror does. Again, we are interested only in the act of transmission without any
travel before or after the interface. As before, (9.32) applies (i.e. y2 = y1).
Figure 9.9 A ray depicted in the
act of transmission at a curved
material interface.
At the interface, the rays obey Snell’s obeys, which in the paraxial approxima-
tions is written
niθi = ntθt
(9.39)
The angles θi and θt are referenced from the surface normal, as seen in Fig. 9.9.
Substituting θ1, θ2 and y1 into Snell’s Law
By inspection of Fig. 9.9, we have
θi = θ1 +φ
(9.40)
and
θt = θ2 +φ
(9.41)
where φ is the angle that the surface normal makes with the z-axis. As before (see
(9.34)), within the paraxial approximation we may write
φ ∼= y1/R

ABCD Matrices for Combined Optical Elements
To summarize the previous two sections, we have developed ABCD matrices for
three basic elements: 1) propagation through a region of uniform index (9.28),
2) reﬂection from a curved mirror (9.38), and 3) transmission through a curved
interface between regions with different indices (9.43). All other ABCD matrices
that we will use are composites of these three. For example, one can construct the
ABCD matrix for a lens by using two matrices like those in (9.43) to represent the
entering and exiting surfaces of the lens. A distance matrix (9.28) can be inserted
to account for the thickness of the lens. It is left as an exercise to derive the ABCD
matrix for a thick lens (see P9.7).

Example 9.5
Derive the ABCD matrix for a thin lens, where the thickness between the two lens
surfaces is ignored. (See P 9.7 for the more general case of a thick lens.)
Solution: A thin lens is depicted in Fig. 9.10. R1 is the radius of curvature for the
ﬁrst surface (which is positive if convex as drawn), and R2 is the radius of curvature
for the second surface (which is negative as drawn).
We take the index outside of the lens to be unity while that of the lens material to
be n. We apply the ABCD matrix (9.43) in sequence, once for entering the lens and
once for exiting:

The matrix for the ﬁrst interface is written on the right, where it operates ﬁrst on
an incoming ray vector. In this case, ni = 1 and nt = n. The matrix for the second
surface is written on the left so that it operates afterwards. For the second surface,
ni = n and nt = 1.

Figure 9.12 A ray that travels
through a distance a, reﬂects from

a distance b.
We have derived our basic ABCD matrices for rays traveling in the y–z plane,
as suggested in Figs. 9.7–9.12. This may have given the impression that it is
necessary to work within a plane that contains the optical axis (i.e. the z-axis
in our case). However, within the paraxial approximation, the ABCD matrices
are valid for rays that become displaced simultaneously in both the x and y
dimensions during propagating along z.
As we demonstrate below, the behavior of rays functions independently in
the x and y dimensions. If desired, one can write a ray vector for each dimen-
sion, namely
£ x
θx
¤
and
h y
θy
i
. Moreover, the identical matrices, for example any
in table 9.1, are used for either dimension. Figs. 9.7–9.12 therefore represent
projections of rays onto the y–z plane. To complete the story, one can imagine
corresponding ﬁgures representing the projection of the rays onto the x–z plane.
8In contrast, the optical path length OPL is effectively longer than free space by the factor n.

9.6 Image Formation
241
Independence of Rays in the x and y Dimensions
Imagine a ray contained within a plane that is parallel to the y–z plane but for
which x > 0. One might be concerned that when the ray meets, for example, a
spherically concave mirror, the radius of curvature in the perspective of the y–z
dimension might be different for x > 0 than for x = 0 (at the center of the mirror).
This concern is actually quite legitimate and is the source of what is known as
spherical aberration. Nevertheless, in the paraxial approximation the intersection
with the curved mirror of all planes that are parallel to the optical axis gives the
same curve.
To see why this is so, consider the curvature of the mirror in Fig. 9.8. As we
move away from the mirror center (in the x or y-dimension or some combination
thereof), the mirror curves to the left by the amount
δ = R −R cosφ
(9.50)
In the paraxial approximation, we have cosφ ∼= 1−φ2/2. And since in this approxi-
mation we may also write φ ∼=
p
x2 + y2
.
R, (9.50) becomes
δ ∼= x2
2R + y2
2R
(9.51)
In the paraxial approximation, we see that the curve of the mirror is parabolic, and
therefore separable between the x and y dimensions. That is, the curvature in
the x-dimension (i.e. ∂δ/∂x = x/R) is independent of y, and the curvature in the
y-dimension (i.e. ∂δ/∂y = y/R) is independent of x. A similar argument can be
made for a spherical interface between two media.
Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de'
Galilei (15641642, Italian) was born
in Pisa, Italy, the son of a musician.
Galileo enrolled in the University of Pisa
with the intent to study medicine but
soon became diverted into mathematics.
He served three years as chair of math-
ematics in Pisa beginning in 1589 and
then moved to the University of Padua
where he taught geometry, mechanics,
and astronomy for two decades. While
Galileo did not invent the telescope,
he improved the design considerably.
With it, he discovered four moons of
Jupiter and was the rst to observe
sunspots and mountains and valleys on
the Moon. Galileo also was the rst to
document the phases of Venus, similar
to the phases of the moon. He used
these observations to argue in favor
of the Copernican model of the solar
system, but this conicted with the pre-
vailing views of the Catholic Church at
the time. He was placed under house
arrest and forbidden to publish of any
of his works. While under house arrest,
he wrote much on kinematics and other
principles of physics and is considered to
be the father of modern physics. Galileo
attempted to measure the speed of
light by observing an assistant uncover
a lantern on a distant hill in response
to a light signal. He concluded that
light is very swift if not instantaneous.

(9.52)
The determinant of the ABCD matrix is one so long as we begin and end in the

table 9.1 are one. Moreover, matrices constructed of matrices whose determinants
are one are guaranteed also to have determinants equal to one.

However, when this matrix is used in succession to form a lens, the resulting matrix has determinant
equal to one.

242
Chapter 9 Light as Rays
where by (9.47) we have replaced 2/R with 1/f . Because of the similarity between
the behavior of a curved mirror and a thin lens, the above expression can also
represent a ray traveling a distance a, traversing a thin lens with focal length f ,
and then traveling a distance b. The only difference is that, in the case of the thin
lens, f is given by lens maker’s formula (9.46).
As is well known, it is possible to form an image with either a curved mirror
or a lens. Suppose that the initial ray is one of many rays that leaves a particular
point on an object positioned a = do before the mirror (or lens). In order for an
image to occur at di = b, it is essential that all rays leaving the particular point on
the object converge to a corresponding point on the image. That is, we want rays
leaving the point y1 on the object (which may take on a range of angles θ1) all to
converge to a single point y2 at the image. In the following equation we need y2
to be independent of θ1:

(9.56)
which is the familiar imaging formula (9.1). When the object is inﬁnitely far away
(i.e. do →∞), the image appears at di →f . This gives a physical interpretation
to the focal length f , as we have been calling it. Please note that do and di can
each be either positive (real as depicted in Fig. 9.13) or negative (virtual meaning
a screen cannot be inserted to display the image).

In the above discussion, we have examined image formation by a thin lens
or a curved mirror. Of course, images can also be formed by thick lenses or by
more complex composite optical systems (e.g. a system of lenses and spaces).
The ABCD matrices for the elements in a composite system are simply multiplied
together to obtain an overall ABCD matrix. We can derive the condition for image
formation by an arbitrary ABCD matrix in the same way that we did above for a
thin lens or curved mirror. As before, consider propagation through a distance do
from an object to the optical system followed by propagation through a distance
di to an image. The ABCD matrix for the overall operation is

Angular Magniﬁcation of a Telescope
A telescope consists of two lenses, the ﬁrst called the objective lens with focal
length fo and the second called the eye piece with focal length fe. The function of a
telescope is to map all rays having incident angle θ1 into corresponding rays all
with wider angle θ2. Importantly, θ2 should only depend on θ1 and not on where
each ray enters the objective lens (i.e. y1).

Principal Planes for Complex Optical Systems
For every ABCD matrix representing an optical system, there exist two principal
planes,10 located (in our convention) a distance p1 before entering the system
and a distance p2 after exiting the system. When the matrices corresponding to
these (appropriately chosen) distances are appended to the original ABCD matrix

of the system, the overall matrix simpliﬁes to one that looks identical to the matrix
for a simple thin lens (9.45).

With knowledge of the positions of the principal planes, one can treat the
complicated imaging system in the same way that one treats a simple thin lens.
That is, we can simply use the common imaging formulas (9.56) and (9.57). The
only difference is that do is the distance from the object to the ﬁrst principal plane
and di is the distance from the second principal plane to the image. In the case
of an actual thin lens, both principal planes are at p1 = p2 = 0. For a composite
system, p1 and p2 can be either positive or negative.
We assert that for any optical system,11 p1 and p2 can always be selected such
that we can write

The ﬁnal matrix is that of a simple thin lens, and it takes the place of the composite

Determination of p1 and p2 and Justiﬁcation of (9.63)
Our task is to ﬁnd the values of p1 and p2 that make (9.63) true. We can straight-
away make the deﬁnition
feff ≡−1/C
(9.64)
We can also solve for p1 and p2 by setting the diagonal elements of the matrix to 1.
Explicitly, we get

It remains to be shown that the upper right element in (9.63) (i.e. p1A + B +

seem unlikely at ﬁrst, but watch what happens!

The ABCD matrix formulation provides a powerful tool to analyze the stability of a
laser cavity.12 The basic elements of a laser cavity include an amplifying medium
and mirrors to provide feedback. Presumably, at least one of the end mirrors is
partially transmitting so that energy is continuously extracted from the cavity.
Here, we dispense with the amplifying medium and concentrate our attention on
the optics providing the feedback.
As might be expected, the mirrors must be carefully aligned or successive
reﬂections might cause rays to ‘walk’ continuously away from the optical axis,
so that they eventually leave the cavity out the side. If a simple cavity is formed
with two ﬂat mirrors that are perfectly aligned parallel to each other, one might
suppose that the mirrors would provide ideal feedback. However, all rays except
for those that are perfectly aligned to the mirror surface normals would eventually
wander out of the side of the cavity as illustrated in Fig. 9.17a. Such a cavity is said
to be unstable. We would like to do a better job of trapping the light in the cavity.
To improve the situation, a cavity can be constructed with concave end mir-
rors to help conﬁne the beams within the cavity. Even so, one must choose
carefully the curvature of the mirrors and their separation L. If this is not done
correctly, the curved mirrors can ‘overcompensate’ for the tendency of the rays
to wander out of the cavity and thus aggravate the problem. Such an unstable
scenario is depicted in Fig. 9.17b.
Figure 9.17c depicts a cavity made with curved mirrors where the separation
L is chosen appropriately to make the cavity stable. Although a ray, as it makes
successive bounces, can strike the end mirrors at a variety of points, the curvature
of the mirrors keeps the ‘trajectories’ contained within a narrow region so that
they cannot escape out the sides of the cavity.
There are many ways to make a stable laser cavity. For example, a stable cavity
can be made using a lens between two ﬂat end mirrors as shown in Fig. 9.17d. Any
combination of lenses (perhaps more than one) and curved mirrors can be used
to create stable cavity conﬁgurations. Ring cavities can also be made to be stable
where in no place do the rays retro-reﬂect from a mirror but circulate through
a series of elements like cars going around a racetrack. The ABCD matrix for a
round trip in the cavity will be useful for this analysis.

where we begin the round trip with transmission through the lens moving to the
right. It is somewhat arbitrary where a round trip begins. Multiplication of the
above matrices will be necessary to do problems P9.16 and P9.17.
To determine whether a given conﬁguration of a cavity is stable, we need to
know what a ray does after making many round trips in the cavity. To ﬁnd the
effect of propagation through many round trips, we multiply the round-trip ABCD
matrix together N times, where N is the number of round trips that we wish to
consider. We can then examine what happens to an arbitrary ray after making N
round trips in the cavity as follows:

θN+1

(9.70)
At this point you might be concerned that taking an ABCD matrix to the N th
power can be a lot of work. (It is already a signiﬁcant work just to compute the
ABCD matrix for a single round trip.) In addition, we are interested in letting N
be very large, perhaps even inﬁnity. You can relax because we have a neat trick to
accomplish this daunting task.
By Sylvester’s theorem in appendix 0.3, we have

(9.71)
where
cosθ = 1
2 (A +D)
(9.72)
This is valid as long as the determinant of the ABCD matrix is one. As noted
earlier (see (9.52)), we are in luck! The determinant is one any time a ray begins
and stops in the same refractive index, which by deﬁnition is guaranteed for any
round trip. We therefore can employ Sylvester’s theorem for any N that we might
choose, including very large integers.
We would like the elements of (9.71) to remain ﬁnite as N becomes very large.
If this is the case, then we know that a ray remains trapped within the cavity
and stays reasonably close to the optical axis. Since N only appears within the
argument of a sine function, which is always bounded between −1 and 1 for

248
Chapter 9 Light as Rays
real arguments, it might seem that the elements of (9.71) always remain ﬁnite
as N approaches inﬁnity. However, it turns out that θ can become imaginary
depending on the outcome of (9.72), in which case the sine becomes a hyperbolic
sine, which can ‘blow up’ as N becomes large. In the end, the condition for cavity
stability is that a real θ must exist for (9.72), or in other words we need
−1 < 1
2 (A +D) < 1
(condition for a stable cavity)
(9.73)
It is left as an exercise to apply this condition to (9.68) and (9.69) to ﬁnd the
necessary relationships between the various element curvatures and spacing in
order to achieve cavity stability.

Aberrations and Ray Tracing
(a)
(b)
Figure 9.18 (a) Paraxial theory pre-
dicts that the light imaged from
a point source will converge to
a point (i.e. have spherical wave
fronts coming to the image point).
(b) The image of a point source
made by a real lens with aberra-
tions is an extended and blurred
patch of light and the converg-
ing wavefronts are only quasi-
spherical.
The paraxial approximation places serious limitations on the performance of
optical systems (see (9.23) and (9.24)). To stay within the approximation, all rays
traveling in the system should travel very close to the optic axis with very shallow
angles with respect to the optical axis. To the extent that this is not the case, the
collection of rays associated with a single point on an object may not converge to
a single point on the associated image. The resulting distortion or “blurring” of
the image is known as aberration.
Common experience with photographic and video equipment suggests that
it is possible to image scenes that have a relatively wide angular extent (many
tens of degrees), in apparent serious violation of the paraxial approximation.
The paraxial approximation is indeed violated in these devices, so they must be
designed using more complicated analysis techniques than those we have learned
in this chapter. The most common approach is to use a computationally intensive
procedure called ray tracing in which sinθ and tanθ are rendered exactly. The
nonlinearity of these functions precludes the possibility of obtaining analytic
solutions describing the imaging performance of such optical systems.
The typical procedure is to start with a collection of rays from a test point such
as shown in Fig. 9.19. Each ray is individually traced through the system using
the exact representation of geometric surfaces as well as the exact representation
of Snell’s law. On close analysis, the rays typically do not converge to a distinct
imaging point. Rather, the rays can be ‘blurred’ out over a range of points where
the image is supposed to occur. Depending on the angular distribution of the
rays as well as on the elements in the setup, the spread of rays around the image
point can be large or small. The engineer who designs the system must determine
whether the amount of aberration is acceptable, given the various constraints of
the device.
Figure 9.19 Ray tracing through a
simple lens.
To minimize aberrations below typical tolerance levels, several lenses can
be used together. If properly chosen, the lenses (some positive, some negative)
separated by speciﬁc distances, can result in remarkably low aberration levels
over certain ranges of operation for the device. Ray tracing is best done with

commercial software designed for this purpose. Such software packages are able
to develop and optimize designs for speciﬁc applications. A useful feature in many
software packages is that the user can specify that the design should employ only
standard optical components available from known optics companies. In any
case, it is typical to specify that all lenses in the system should have spherical
surfaces since these are much less expensive to manufacture. We mention brieﬂy
several common classes of aberrations that can occur if a lens system is not
properly designed.
Chromatic aberration arises from the fact that the index of refraction for glass
varies with the wavelength of light. Since the focal length of a lens depends on
the index of refraction (see, for example, Eq. (9.46)), the focal length of a lens
varies with the wavelength of light. Chromatic aberration can be compensated
for by using a pair of lenses made from two types of glass as shown in Fig. 9.20
(the pair is usually cemented together to form a “doublet” lens). The lens with the
shortest focal length is made of the glass whose index has the lesser dependence
on wavelength. By properly choosing the prescription of the two lenses, you
can exactly compensate for chromatic aberration at two wavelengths and do a
good job for a wide range of others. Achromatic doublets can also be designed to
minimize spherical aberration (see below), so they are often a good choice when
you need a high quality lens.

glass
high dispersion

Figure 9.20 Chromatic aberration
causes lenses to have different
focal lengths for different wave-
lengths. It can be corrected using
an achromatic doublet lens.
Monochromatic aberrations arise from the shape of the lens rather than the
variation of n with wavelength. Before the advent of computers facilitated the
widespread use of ray tracing, these aberrations had to be analyzed analyti-
cally. The analytic results derived previously in this chapter were based on a
ﬁrst-order approximation (e.g. sinθ ≈θ). One can increase the accuracy of the
theory for non-paraxial rays by retaining higher-order terms in the polynomial-
representation of sinθ. With higher-order terms included, the wave fronts con-
verging towards an image point are still approximately spherical, but have aber-
ration terms added in (shown conceptually in Fig. 9.18(b)). Without going into
detail, there are ﬁve aberration terms in the standard second-order analysis,
which represent a convenient basis for discussing aberration.
The ﬁrst aberration term is known as spherical aberration. This type of aber-
ration results from the fact that rays traveling through a spherical lens at large
radii experience a different focal length than those traveling near the axis. For
a converging lens, this causes far-off-radius rays to focus before the near-axis
rays as shown in Fig. 9.21. This problem can be helped by orienting lenses so
that the face with the least curvature is pointed towards the side where the light
rays have the largest angle. This procedure splits the bending of rays more evenly
between the front and back surface of the lens. As mentioned above, you can also
cement two lenses made from different types of glass together so that spherical
aberrations from one lens are corrected by the other.
Figure 9.21 Spherical aberration
in a plano-convex lens.
The aberration term referred to as astigmatism occurs when an off-axis object
point is imaged to an off-axis image point. In this case a spherical lens has a
different focal length in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. For a focusing lens

aged to point a as predicted by paraxial theory. Rays that travel through the lens at
radius ρb in the plane of the ﬁgure are imaged to point b. Rays that travel through the
lens at radius ρb, but outside the plane of the ﬁgure are imaged to other points on the
circle (in the image plane) containing point b. Rays at that travel through the lens at
other radii on the lens (e.g. ρc) also form circles in the image plane with radius propor-
tional to ρ2 with the center offset from point a a distance proportional to ρ2. When
light from each of these circles combines on the screen it produces an imaged point
with a “comet tail.”
this causes the two dimensions to focus at different distances, producing a vertical
‘line’ at one image plane and a horizontal ‘line’ at another (see Fig. 9.22). A lens
can also be inherently astigmatic even when viewed on axis if it is football shaped
rather than spherical. In this case, the astigmatic aberration can be corrected by
inserting a cylindrical lens at the correct orientation (this is a common correction
needed in eyeglasses).

Figure 9.22 Astigmatism causes
the horizontal and vertical di-
mensions to focus at different

A third aberration term is referred to as coma. This is observed when off-axis
points are imaged and produces a comet shaped tail with its head at the point
predicted by paraxial theory. (The term ‘coma’ refers to the atmosphere of a
comet, which is how the aberration got its name.) This aberration is distinct from
astigmatism, which is also observed for off-axis points, since coma is observed
even when all of the rays are in one plane (see Fig. 9.23). You have probably seen
coma if you’ve ever played with a magnifying glass in the sun—just tilt the lens
slightly and you see a comet-like image rather than a point.
The curvature of the ﬁeld aberration term arises from the fact that spherical
lenses image spherical surfaces to another spherical surface, rather than imaging
a plane to a plane. This is not so bad for your eyeball, which has a curved screen,
but for things like cameras and movie projectors we would like to image to a ﬂat
screen. When a ﬂat screen is used and the curvature of the ﬁeld aberration is
present, the image will focus well near the center, but become progressively out
of focus as you move to the edge of the screen (i.e. the ﬂat screen is farther from
the curved image surface as you move from the center).

Pincushion Distortion
Figure 9.24 Distortion occurs

stant across an extended image.
The ﬁnal aberration term is referred to as distortion. This aberration occurs
when the magniﬁcation of a lens depends on the distance from the center of
the screen. If magniﬁcation decreases as the distance from the center increases,
then ‘barrel’ distortion is observed. When magniﬁcation increases with distance,
‘pincushion’ distortion is observed (see Fig. 9.24).
All lenses will exhibit some combination of the aberrations listed above (i.e.

chromatic aberration plus the ﬁve second-order aberration terms). In addition to
the ﬁve named monochromatic aberrations, there are many other higher order
aberrations that also have to be considered. Aberrations can be corrected to a high
degree with multiple-element systems (designed using ray-tracing techniques)
composed of lenses and irises to eliminate off-axis light. For example, a camera
lens with a focal length of 50 mm, one of the simplest lenses in photography, is
typically composed of about six individual elements. However, optical systems
never completely eliminate all aberration, so designing a system always involves
some degree of compromise in choosing which aberrations to minimize and
which ones you can live with.

Chapter 10
Diffraction
Christiaan Huygens (16291695,
Dutch) was born in The Hague, Nether-
lands. His father was friends with the
mathematician René Descartes, which
probably inuenced his upbringing. Huy-
gens studied law and mathematics at
the University of Leiden, which preceded
a very productive career as a scientist
and mathematician. During mid career,
Huygens held a position in the French
Academy of Sciences in Paris for 15
years, but he spent the majority of his
life in The Hague. Huygens was the rst
to advocate the wave theory of light.
He was able to explain birefringence in
terms of his wave theory assuming a
refractive index that varied with direc-
tion. Huygens constructed a telescope
with which he discovered Saturn's moon
Titan. He also made the rst detailed
observations of the Orion nebula. Huy-
gens made signicant advancements in
clock-making technology and wrote a
book on probability theory. Huygens
was one of the earliest science-ction
writers and speculated that life exists on
other planets in his book Cosmotheoros.
(Wikipedia)
In the 1600’s, Christiaan Huygens developed a wave description for light. Unfor-
tunately, his ideas were largely overlooked at the time because Sir Isaac Newton
promoted a competing theory. Newton proposed that light should be thought
of as many tiny bullets, or corpuscles, as he called them. Newton’s ideas pre-
vailed for more than a century, perhaps because he was right on so many other
things, until 1807 when Thomas Young performed his famous two-slit experiment,
conclusively demonstrating the wave nature of light. Even then, Young’s conclu-
sions were accepted only gradually by others, a notable exception being a young
Frenchman named Augustin Fresnel. The two formed a close friendship through
correspondence, and it was Fresnel that followed up on Young’s conclusions and
dedicated his life to a study of light.
Fresnel’s skill as a mathematician allowed him to transform physical intuition
into powerful and concise ideas. Perhaps Fresnel’s greatest accomplishment was
the adaptation of Huygens’ principle of wavelet superposition into a mathematical
formula. Ironically, he used Newton’s calculus to achieve this. Huygens’ principle
asserts that a wave front can be thought of as many wavelets, which propagate and
interfere to form new wave fronts. This is illustrated in Fig. 10.1. The phenomenon
of diffraction is then understood as the spilling of wavelets around obstructions
in the path of light.
After formulating Huygens’ principle as a diffraction integral, Fresnel made
an approximation to his own formula, called the Fresnel approximation, for the
sake of making the integration easier to perform. As far as approximations go,
the Fresnel approximation is surprisingly accurate in describing the light ﬁeld
in the region downstream from an aperture. The diffraction pattern can evolve
in complicated ways as the distance from an aperture increases. At distances far
downstream from an aperture, the diffraction pattern acquires a ﬁnal form that
no longer evolves, other than to grow in proportion to distance. This far-ﬁeld
limit is often of interest, and it turns out that the Fresnel diffraction formula can
be simpliﬁed further in this case. The far-ﬁeld limit of the Fresnel diffraction
formula is called the Fraunhofer approximation.
From the modern perspective, Fresnel’s diffraction formula needs justiﬁca-
257

tion starting from Maxwell’s equation. The diffraction formula is based on scalar
diffraction theory, which ignores polarization effects. In some situations, ignor-
ing polarization is benign, but in other situations, ignoring polarization effects
produces signiﬁcant errors. These issues as well as the approximations leading to
scalar diffraction theory are discussed in section 10.2.
10.1
Huygens’ Principle as Formulated by Fresnel
Figure 10.1 Wave fronts depicted
as a series of Huygens’ wavelets.
In this section we discuss the calculus of summing up the contributions from the
many wavelets originating in an aperture illuminated by a light ﬁeld. Each point
in the aperture is thought of as a source of a spherical wavelet.1 In our modern
notation, such a spherical wave can be written as proportional to eikR/R, where
R is the distance from the source. As a spherical wave propagates, its strength
falls off in proportion to the distance traveled and the phase is related to the
distance propagated, similar to the phase of a plane wave. It should be noted that
by choosing k, we consider only a single wavelength of light (i.e. one frequency).
A spherical wave of the form eikR/R technically does not satisfy Maxwell’s
equations (see P10.4). For one thing, it utterly fails near R = 0. However, if R is
large compared to a wavelength, this spherical wave starts to resemble actual
solutions to Maxwell’s equations, as will be examined in the next section. It is
within this regime that the diffraction formula derived here is successful.
Consider an aperture or opening in an opaque screen located at the plane
z = 0. Let the aperture be illuminated with a light ﬁeld distribution E(x′, y′,z = 0)
within the aperture. Then for a point (x, y,z) lying somewhere after the aperture
(z > 0), the net ﬁeld is given by adding together the contribution of wavelets
emitted from each point in the aperture.
Figure 10.2
Each spherical wavelet is assigned the strength and phase of the ﬁeld at the
point where it originates. Mathematically, this summation takes the form

is the radius of each wavelet as it individually intersects the point (x, y,z). We will
call (10.1) the Huygens-Fresnel2 diffraction formula, although Fresnel is credited
with this integral formulation. The factor −i/λ in front of the integral in (10.1)
ensures the right phase and ﬁeld strength (not to mention correct units). Justiﬁca-
tion for this factor is given in section 10.3 and in appendix 10.A. To summarize,
1For simplicity, we use the term ‘spherical wave’ in this book to refer to waves of the type
imagined by Huygens (i.e. of the form eikR/R). There is a different family of waves based on
spherical harmonics that are also sometimes referred to as spherical waves. These waves have
angular as well as radial dependence, and they are solutions to Maxwell’s equations. See J. D.

(10.1) tells us how to compute the ﬁeld downstream given knowledge of the ﬁeld
in an aperture. The ﬁeld at each point (x′, y′) in the aperture, which may vary
with strength and phase, is treated as the source for a spherical wave. The integral
in (10.1) sums the contributions from all of these wavelets.

the region between a circle and a

When an aperture has a complicated shape, it may be convenient to break
up the diffraction integral (10.1) into several pieces. As an example, suppose that
we have an aperture consisting of a circular obstruction within a square opening
as depicted in Fig. 10.5. Thus, the light transmits through the region between
the circle and the square. One can evaluate the overall diffraction pattern by
ﬁrst evaluating the diffraction integral for the entire square (ignoring the circular
block) and then subtracting the diffraction integral for a circular opening having
the shape of the block. This removes the unwanted part of the previous integration
and yields the overall result. When doing this, it is important to add and subtract
the integrals (i.e. ﬁelds), not their squares (i.e. intensity).
It may be less obvious at ﬁrst that you can use the above superposition tech-
nique to handle diffraction from ﬁnite obstructions that interrupt an inﬁnitely

wide plane wave. One simply computes the diffraction of the blocked portion
of the ﬁeld as though it came from an opening in a mask. The result is then
subtracted from the plane wave (no integration needed for the plane wave), as
depicted in Fig. 10.6. This is known as Babinet’s principle.

block in a plane wave giving rise

shadow.
When Fresnel ﬁrst presented his diffraction formula to the French Academy
of Sciences, a certain judge of scientiﬁc papers named Siméon Poisson noticed
that Fresnel’s formula predicted that there should be light in the center of the
geometric shadow behind a circular obstruction. This seemed so absurd to
Poisson that he initially disbelieved the theory, until the spot was shortly thereafter
experimentally conﬁrmed, much to Poisson’s chagrin. Needless to say, Fresnel’s
paper was then awarded ﬁrst prize, and this spot appearing behind circular blocks
has since been known as Poisson’s spot.
Example 10.2
Find the on-axis (i.e. x, y = 0) intensity behind a circular block of diameter D
placed in a uniform plane wave.
Solution: From Example 10.1, the on-axis ﬁeld behind a circular aperture is

. Babinet’s principle says to subtract this result from a
plane wave to obtain the ﬁeld behind the circular block. The situation is depicted
in Fig. 10.6. The on-axis ﬁeld is then
E (0,0,z) = E0eikz −E0

(D/2)2+z2e−ikp
(D/2)2+z2 = |E0|2
In the exact center of the shadow behind the circular obstruction, the intensity is
the same as the illuminating plane wave for all distance z. A spot of light in the
center forms right away; no wonder Poisson was astonished!
10.2
Scalar Diffraction Theory
In this section we provide the background motivation for Huygen’s principle and
Fresnel’s formulation of it. Consider a light ﬁeld with a single frequency ω. The
light ﬁeld can be represented by E(r)e−iωt, and the time derivative in the wave
equation (2.13) can be easily performed. It reduces to
∇2E(r)+k2E(r) = 0
(10.4)
where k ≡nω/c is the magnitude of the usual wave vector (see also (9.2)). Equa-
tion (10.4) is called the Helmholtz equation. Again, it is merely the wave equation

written for the case of a single frequency, where the trivial time dependence has
been removed. To obtain the full wave solution, just append the factor e−iωt to
the solution of (10.4).
Francois Jean Dominique Arago
(1786-1853, French) was born in Cata-
lan France, where his father was the
Treasurer of the Mint. As a teenager,
Arago was sent to a municipal college
in Perpignan where he developed a
deep interest in mathematics. In 1803,
he entered the Ecole Polytechnique in
Paris, where he purportedly was dis-
appointed that he was not presented
with new knowledge at a higher rate.
He associated with famous French
mathematicians Siméon Poisson and
Pierre-Simmon Laplace. He later worked
with Jean-Baptiste Biot to measure
the meridian arch to determine the
exact length of the meter. This work
took him to the Balearic Islands, Spain,
where he was imprisoned as a spy, be-
ing suspected because of lighting res
atop a mountain as part of his survey-
ing eorts. After a heroic prison escape
and a subsequent string of misfortunes,
he eventually made it back to France
where he took a strong interest in op-
tics and the wave theory of light. Arago
and Fresnel established a fruitful collab-
oration that extended for many years.
It was Arago who demonstrated Pois-
son's spot (sometimes called Arago's
spot). Arago also invented the rst po-
larizing lter. In later life, he served a
brief stint as the French prime minister.
(Wikipedia)
At this point we take an egregious step: We ignore the vectorial nature of E(r)
and write (10.4) using only the magnitude E(r). When using scalar diffraction
theory, we must keep in mind that it is based on this serious step. Under the
scalar approximation, the vector Helmholtz equation (10.4) becomes the scalar
Helmholtz equation:
∇2E (r)+k2E (r) = 0
(10.5)
This equation of course is consistent with (10.4) in the case of a plane wave.
However, we are interested in spherical waves of the form E (r) = E0r0eikr /r. It
turns out that such spherical waves are exact solutions to the scalar Helmholtz
equation (10.5). The proof is left as an exercise (see P10.3). Nevertheless, spherical
waves of this form only approximately satisfy the vector Helmholtz equation (10.4).
We can get away with this sleight of hand if the radius r is large compared to a
wavelength (i.e., kr ≫1) and if we restrict r to a narrow range perpendicular to
the polarization.
Signiﬁcance of the Scalar Wave Approximation
The solution of the scalar Helmholtz equation is not completely unassociated with
the solution to the vector Helmholtz equation. In fact, if Escalar (r) obeys the scalar
Helmholtz equation (10.5), then
E(r) = r×∇Escalar (r)
(10.6)
obeys the vector Helmholtz equation (10.4).
Consider a spherical wave, which is a solution to the scalar Helmholtz equation:
Escalar (r) = E0r0eikr /r
(10.7)
Remarkably, when this expression is placed into (10.6) the result is zero. Although
zero is in fact a solution to the vector Helmholtz equation, it is not very interesting.
A more interesting solution to the scalar Helmholtz equation is
Escalar (r) = r0E0

which is one of an inﬁnite number of unique ‘spherical’ solutions that exist. Notice
that in the limit of large r, this expression looks similar to (10.7), aside from the
factor cosθ. The vector form of this ﬁeld according to (10.6) is

This ﬁeld looks approximately like the scalar spherical wave solution (10.7) in the

Since our use of the scalar Helmholtz equation is in connection with this spherical
wave under these conditions, the results are close to those obtained from the
vector Helmholtz equation.

Figure 10.7
Fresnel developed his diffraction formula (10.1) a half century before Maxwell
assembled the equations of electromagnetic theory. In 1887, Gustav Kirchhoff
demonstrated that Fresnel’s diffraction formula satisﬁes the scalar Helmholtz
equation. In doing this he clearly showed the approximations implicit in the
theory, and made a slight revision to the formula:

The factor in square brackets, Kirchhoff’s revision, is known as the obliquity factor.
Here, cos(R,ˆz) indicates the cosine of the angle between R and ˆz. Notice that this
factor is approximately equal to one when the point (x, y,z) is chosen to be in
the forward direction; we usually study diffraction under this circumstance. On
the other hand, the obliquity factor equals zero for ﬁelds traveling in the reverse
direction (i.e. in the −ˆz direction). This ﬁxes a problem with Fresnel’s version of
the formula (10.1) based on Huygens’ wavelets, which suggested that light could
as easily diffract in the reverse direction as in the forward direction
In honor of Kirchhoff’s work, (10.10) is referred to as the Fresnel-Kirchhoff
diffraction formula. The details of Kirchhoff’s more rigorous derivation, including
how the factor −i/λ naturally arises, are given in appendix 10.A. Since the Fresnel-
Kirchhoff formula can be understood as a superposition of spherical waves, it is
not surprising that it satisﬁes the scalar Helmholtz equation (10.5).
10.3
Fresnel Approximation
Although the Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral looks innocent enough, it is actually
quite difﬁcult to evaluate analytically. Even the Huygens-Fresnel version (10.1)
where the obliquity factor (1+cos(r,ˆz))/2 is approximated as one (i.e. far forward
direction) is challenging. The integration can be challenging even if we choose a
ﬁeld E

that is uniform across the aperture (i.e. a constant).
Fresnel introduced an approximation4 to his diffraction formula that makes
the integration somewhat easier to perform. The approximation is analogous to
the paraxial approximation made for rays in chapter 9.
Besides letting the obliquity factor be one, Fresnel approximated R by the
distance z in the denominator of (10.10) . Then the denominator can be brought
out in front of the integral since it no longer depends on x′ and y′. This is valid to
the extent that we restrict ourselves to small angles:
R ∼= z
(denominator only; Fresnel approximation) (10.11)
The above approximation is wholly inappropriate in the exponent of (10.10) since
small changes in R can result in dramatic variations in the periodic function eikR.

10.3 Fresnel Approximation

To approximate R in the exponent, we must proceed with caution. To this end
we expand (10.2) under the assumption z2 ≫(x −x′)2 +(y −y′)2. Again, this is
consistent with the idea of restricting ourselves to relatively small angles. The
expansion of (10.2) is written as

Unfortunately, the integration in the preceding example must be performed

imation, but at least numerical fast Fourier transforms can aid in the process.
Figure 10.8 shows the result of integration for a rectangular aperture with a height
twice its width.
Paraxial Wave Equation
If we assume that the light coming through the aperture is highly directional, such
that it propagates mainly in the z-direction, we are motivated to write the ﬁeld
as E(x, y,z) = ˜E(x, y,z)eikz. Upon substitution of this into the scalar Helmholtz
equation (10.5), we arrive at
∂2 ˜E
∂x2 + ∂2 ˜E
∂y2 +2ik ∂˜E
∂z + ∂2 ˜E
∂z2 = 0
(10.14)
At this point we make the paraxial wave approximation,5 which is |2k ∂˜E
∂z | ≫| ∂2 ˜E
∂z2 |.
That is, we assume that the amplitude of the ﬁeld varies slowly in the z-direction

such that the wave looks much like a plane wave. We permit the amplitude to
change as the wave propagates in the z-direction as long as it does so on a scale
much longer than a wavelength. This leads to the paraxial wave equation:

Joseph von Fraunhofer (17871826,
German) was born in Straubing, Bavaria.
He was orphaned at age 11, whereupon
he was apprenticed to a glassmaker.
The workshop collapsed, trapping him
in the rubble. The Prince of Bavaria
directed the rescue eorts and thereafter
took an interest in Fraunhofer's educa-
tion. The prince required the glassmaker
to allow young Joseph time to study,
and he naturally took an interest in
optics. Fraunhofer later worked at the
Optical Institute at Benediktbeuern,
where he learned techniques for making
the nest optical glass in his day. Fraun-
hofer developed numerous glass recipes
and was expert at creating optical de-
vices. Fraunhofer was the inventor of
the spectroscope, making it possible to
do quantitative spectroscopy. Using his
spectroscope, Fraunhofer was the rst
to observe and document hundreds of
absorption lines in the sun's spectrum.
He also noticed that these varied for
dierent stars, thus establishing the eld
of stellar spectroscopy. He was also the
inventor of the diraction grating. In
1822, he was granted an honorary doc-
torate from the University of Erlangen.
Fraunhofer passed away at age 39, per-
haps due to heavy-metal poisoning from
glass blowing. (Wikipedia)
10.4
Fraunhofer Approximation
An additional approximation to the diffraction integral was made famous by
Joseph von Fraunhofer. The Fraunhofer approximation is the limiting case of
the Fresnel approximation when the ﬁeld is observed at a distance far after the
aperture (called the far ﬁeld).6 A diffraction pattern continuously evolves along
the z-direction, as described by the Fresnel approximation. Eventually it evolves
into a ﬁnal diffraction pattern that maintains itself as it continues to propogate (al-
though it increases its size in proportion to distance). It is this far-away diffraction
pattern that is obtained from the Fraunhofer approximation. Since the Fresnel
approximation requires the angles to be small (i.e. the paraxial approximation),
so does the Fraunhofer approximation.
To obtain the diffraction pattern at a distance very far from the aperture, we
make the following approximation:7
ei k
2z (x′2+y′2) ∼= 1
(far ﬁeld) (10.17)
The validity of this approximation depends on a comparison of the size of the
aperture to the distance z where the diffraction pattern is observed. We need

(condition for far ﬁeld) (10.18)

Fresnel approximation.

10.5 Diffraction with Cylindrical Symmetry
265
Obviously, the removal of ei k
2z (x′2+y′2) from the integrand improves our chances
of being able to perform the integration analytically. In fact the integral can be
interpreted as a two-dimensional (inverse) Fourier transform on the aperture
ﬁeld E
¡
x′, y′,0
¢
, where kx/z and ky/z can be thought of as ‘spatial frequencies’.
Once we are in the regime where the Fraunhofer approximation is valid, a
change in z is not very interesting since it appears within the integral only in the
combination x/z or y/z. At a larger distance z, the same diffraction pattern is
obtained with a proportionately larger values of x or y. The Fraunhofer diffraction
pattern thus preserves itself indeﬁnitely as the ﬁeld propagates. It grows in size as
the distance z increases, but the angular size deﬁned by x/z or y/z remains the
same.

Diffraction with Cylindrical Symmetry
Sometimes the ﬁeld transmitted by an aperture is cylindrically symmetric. In this
case, the ﬁeld at the aperture can be written as
E(x′, y′,z = 0) = E(ρ′,z = 0)
(10.21)
where ρ ≡
p
x2 + y2. Under cylindrical symmetry, the two-dimensional integra-
tion over x′ and y′ in (10.13) or (10.19) can be reduced to a single-dimensional
integral over a cylindrical coordinate ρ′. With the coordinate transformation
x ≡ρ cosφ
y ≡ρ sinφ
x′ ≡ρ′ cosφ′

where E (r) is assumed to satisfy the scalar Helmholtz equation, (10.5). When

comprised of two parts (i.e. S = S1 +S2 as depicted in Fig. 10.12).

If we know E everywhere on the outer surface S2, this equation allows us to predict
the ﬁeld E (0) at the origin.
Now let us choose a speciﬁc surface S2. Consider an inﬁnite mask with a
ﬁnite aperture connected to a hemisphere of inﬁnite radius R →∞. In the end,
we will suppose that light enters through the mask and propagates to our origin
(among other points). In our present coordinate system, the vectors r and ˆn point
opposite to the incoming light.

Figure 10.13 Surface S2 depicted
as a mask and a large hemisphere.
We must evaluate (10.38) on the surface depicted in the ﬁgure. For the portion
of S2 that is on the hemisphere, the integrand tends to zero as R becomes large.
To argue this, it is necessary to recognize the fact that at large distances the ﬁeld
takes on a form proportional to eikr /r so that the two terms in the integrand
cancel. On the mask, we assume, as did Kirchhoff, that both ∂E/∂n and E are
zero.12 Thus, we are left with only the integration over the open aperture:

to drop a term. Next, we assume that the ﬁeld illuminating the aperture can be

In our derivation, it was less cumbersome to place the origin at a point of interest
12Later Sommerfeld noticed that these two assumptions actually contradict each other, and he
revised Kirchhoff’s work to be more accurate. In practice this revision makes only a tiny difference
as light spills onto the back of the aperture, over a length scale of a wavelength. We will ignore
this effect and go with Kirchhoff’s (slightly ﬂawed) assumption. For further discussion see J. W.

The integrand on the right-hand side of (10.46) can be expanded with the product

Diffraction Applications
In this chapter, we consider a number of practical examples of diffraction. We ﬁrst
discuss diffraction theory in systems involving lenses. The Fraunhofer diffraction
pattern discussed in section 10.4, applicable in the far-ﬁeld limit, is imaged
to the focus of a lens when the lens is placed in the stream of light. This has
important implications for the resolution of instruments such as telescopes or
grating spectrometers.
The array theorem, which applies to Fraunhofer limit, is introduced in sec-
tion 11.3. This theorem is a powerful mathematical tool that enables one to deal
conveniently with diffraction from an array of identical apertures. One of the
important uses of the array theorem is in determining Fraunhofer diffraction
from a grating, since a diffraction grating can be thought of as an array of narrow
slit apertures. In section 11.5, we study the workings of a diffraction spectrometer
and explore resolution limitations.
Finally, we consider a Gaussian laser beam to understand its focusing and
diffraction properties. The information presented here comes up remarkably
often in research activity. We often think of lasers as collimated beams of light
that propagate indeﬁnitely without expanding. However, the laws of diffraction
require that every ﬁnite beam eventually grows in width. The rate at which a laser
beam diffracts depends on its beam waist size. Because laser beams usually have
narrow divergence angles and therefore obey the paraxial approximation, we can
calculate their behavior via the Fresnel approximation discussed in section 10.3.
Appendix 11.A discusses the ABCD law for Gaussian beams, which is a method
of computing the effects of optical elements such as lenses on laser beams. The
ABCD law arbitrates the competition between beam expansion via diffraction
and beam focusing from traversing a lens.
11.1
Fraunhofer Diffraction with a Lens
The Fraunhofer limit corresponds to the ultimate amount of diffraction that
light in an optical system experiences. As has been previously discussed, the
Fraunhofer approximation applies to diffraction when the propagation distance

from an aperture is sufﬁciently large (see (10.18) and (10.19)). Mathematically, it
is obtained via a two-dimensional Fourier transform. The intensity of the far-ﬁeld

(11.1)
Notice that the dependence of the diffraction on x, y, and z comes only
through the combinations θx ∼= x/z and θy ∼= y/z. Therefore, the diffraction
pattern in the Fraunhofer limit is governed by the two angles θx and θy, and
the pattern preserves itself indeﬁnitely. As the light continues to propagate, the
pattern increases in size at a rate proportional to distance traveled so that the
angular width is preserved. The situation is depicted in Fig. 11.1.
Figure 11.1 Diffraction in the far
ﬁeld.
Recall that in order to use the Fraunhofer diffraction formula we need to
satisfy z ≫π
¡
aperture radius
¢2/λ (see (10.18)). As an example, if an aperture
with a 1 cm radius (not necessarily circular) is used with visible light, the light
must travel more than a kilometer in order to reach the Fraunhofer limit. It
may therefore seem unlikely to reach the Fraunhofer limit in a typical optical
system, especially if the aperture or beam size is relatively large. Nevertheless,
spectrometers, which typically utilize diffraction gratings many centimeters wide,
depend on achieving the Fraunhofer limit within the conﬁnes of a manageable
instrument box. This is accomplished using imaging techniques. The Fraunhofer
limit is also naturally reached in other instruments that employ lenses such as
telescopes.
Consider a lens with focal length f placed in the path of light following an
aperture (see Fig. 11.2). Let the lens be placed an arbitrary distance L after the
aperture. The lens produces an image of the Fraunhofer pattern at a new location
di following the lens according to the imaging formula (see (9.56))

(11.2)
Keep in mind that the lens interrupts the light before the Fraunhofer pattern
has a chance to form. This means that the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern may

be thought of as a virtual object a distance z −L to the right of the lens. Since
the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern occurs at very large distances (i.e. z →∞) the
image of the Fraunhofer pattern appears at the focus of the lens:
di ∼= f .
(11.3)
Thus, a lens makes it very convenient to observe the Fraunhofer diffraction pat-
tern even from relatively large apertures. It is not necessary to let the light propa-
gate for kilometers. We need only observe the pattern at the focus of the lens as
shown in Fig. 11.2. Notice that the spacing L between the aperture and the lens is
unimportant to this conclusion.
Even though we know that the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern occurs at the
focus of a lens, the question remains as to the size of the image. To ﬁnd the answer,
let us examine the magniﬁcation (9.57), which is given by
M = −
di
−(z −L)
(11.4)
Taking the limit of very large z and employing (11.3), the magniﬁcation becomes
M →f
z
(11.5)
This is a remarkable result. When the lens is inserted, the size of the diffraction
pattern decreases by the ratio of the lens focal length f to the original distance
z to a far-away screen. Since in the Fraunhofer regime the diffraction pattern is
proportional to distance (i.e. size ∝z), the image at the focus of the lens scales
in proportion to the focal length (i.e. size ∝f ). This means that the angular
width of the pattern is preserved! With the lens in place, we can rewrite (11.1)

which describes the intensity distribution pattern at the focus of the lens.
Although (11.6) correctly describes the intensity at the focus of a lens, we
cannot easily write the electric ﬁeld since the imaging techniques that we have
used do not easily render the phase information. To obtain an expression for
the ﬁeld, it will be necessary to employ the Fresnel diffraction formula, which
we accomplish in the remainder of this section. Before doing so, we will need to
know how a lens adjusts the phase fronts of the light passing through it.
Phase Front Alteration by a Lens
Consider a monochromatic light ﬁeld that goes through a thin lens with focal
length f . In traversing the lens, the wavefront undergoes a phase shift that varies
across the lens. We will reference the phase shift to that experienced by the light

278
Chapter 11 Diffraction Applications
that goes through the center of the lens. We take the distances ℓ1 and ℓ2, as drawn
in Fig. 11.3, to be positive.
Figure 11.3 A thin lens, which
modiﬁes the phase of a ﬁeld pass-
ing through.
The light passing through the off-axis portion of the lens experiences less material
than the light passing through the center. The difference in optical path length is
(n −1)(ℓ1 +ℓ2) (see discussion connected with (9.13)). This means that the phase
of the ﬁeld passing through the off-axis portion of the lens relative to the phase of
the ﬁeld passing through the center is
∆φ = −k (n −1)(ℓ1 +ℓ2).
(11.7)
The negative sign indicates a phase advance (i.e. same sign as −ωt). In (11.7), k
represents the wave number in vacuum (i.e. 2π/λvac); since ℓ1 and ℓ2 correspond
to distances outside of the lens material.
We can ﬁnd expressions for ℓ1 and ℓ2 from the equations describing the spherical
surfaces of the lens:
(R1 −ℓ1)2 + x2 + y2 = R2
1
(R2 +ℓ2)2 + x2 + y2 = R2
2
(11.8)
As drawn in Fig. 11.3, R1 is a positive radius of curvature while R2 is negative, in ac-
cordance with conventions in chapter 9. In the spirit of the Fresnel approximation,
which takes place in the paraxial limit, it is appropriate to neglect the terms ℓ2
1 and
ℓ2
2 in comparison to other terms present in (11.8). Within this approximation, the
equations become
ℓ1 ∼= x2 + y2

and
ℓ2 ∼= −x2 + y2

Equation (11.11) introduces a wave-front curvature to the ﬁeld. For example, if a
plane wave (i.e. a uniform ﬁeld E0) passes through the lens, the ﬁeld emerges with
a spherical-like wave front converging towards the focus of the lens.
Figure 11.4 The phase fronts of a
plane wave are bent as they pass
through a lens.
We compute the diffraction pattern after the lens in three steps, as illustrated
in Fig. 11.5. First, we use the Fresnel approximation to compute the ﬁeld arriving
at the lens. Second, we adjust the phase front of the light passing through the
lens according to (11.11). Third, we use the ﬁeld exiting the lens as the input for a
second diffraction integral to ﬁnd the ﬁeld at the lens focus. The result gives an
intensity pattern in agreement with (11.6) without ever employing the Fraunhofer
approximation. It also provides the full expression for the ﬁeld, including its
phase.

transmitting through the lens. Finally, we use the Fresnel diffraction formula a
second time to propagate the distance f from the back of the thin lens:

Figure 11.5 Diffraction from an

Right off, by choosing to the propagation distance to be f , we get a nice can-
cellation of the phase factor introduced by the lens. Even so, as you can probably
appreciate, the installation of (11.12) into (11.13) makes a rather long formula
involving four dimensions of integration. Nevertheless, two of the integrals can
be performed in advance of choosing the aperture (i.e. those over x′′ and y′′).
This is accomplished with the help of the integral formula (0.55) (even though
in this instance the real part of a is zero). After this cumbersome work, (11.13)
reduces to

Notice that at least the integration portion of this formula looks exactly like
the Fraunhofer diffraction formula! This happened even though in the preceding
discussion we did not at any time speciﬁcally make the Fraunhofer approximation.
The result (11.14) implies the intensity distribution (11.6) as anticipated. However,
the phase of the ﬁeld is also revealed in (11.14).
In general, the ﬁeld caries a wave front curvature as it passes through the
focal plane of the lens. In the special case L = f , the diffraction formula takes a
particularly simple form:

11.2
Resolution of a Telescope
In the previous section we learned that the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern appears
at the focus of a lens. This has important implications for telescopes and other
optical instruments. In essence, any optical instrument incorporates an aperture,
limiting the light that enters. If nothing else, the diameter of a lens itself acts
effectively as an aperture. The pupil of the human eye is an aperture that causes a
Fraunhofer diffraction pattern to occur at the retina. Cameras have irises which
aperture the light, again giving rise to a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern at the
image plane.
Of course, the focus of the lens is just where one wants to look in order to see
images of distant objects. Of course, the Fraunhofer pattern, which occurs at the
focus, represents the ultimate amount of diffraction caused by an aperture. This
has the effect of blurring out features in the image and limiting resolution. This
illustrates why it is impossible to focus light to a true point.
Figure 11.6 To resolve distinct im-
ages at the focus of a lens, the an-
gular separation must exceed the
width of the Fraunhofer diffraction
patterns.
Suppose you point a telescope at two distant stars. An image of each star is
formed in the focal plane of the lens. The angular separation between the two
images (referenced from the lens) is the same as the angular separation between
the stars.1 This is depicted in Fig. 11.6. For reference, we are speaking of the image
that forms between the objective lens and the eye piece of a telescope, as seen in
Fig. 9.15. Often, a CCD camera is placed at that image plane so that there is no
need for an eyepiece.
A resolution problem occurs when the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern asso-
ciated with each star causes them to blur by more than the angular separation
between them. In this case the two images cannot be resolved because they
‘bleed’ into one another.

where f , the focal length of the lens, takes the place of z in the diffraction formula.
The parameter D is its diameter of the lens. This intensity pattern contains the
ﬁrst-order Bessel function J1, which behaves somewhat like a sine wave as seen in
Fig. 11.7. The main differences are that the zero crossings are not exactly periodic
and the function slowly diminishes with larger arguments. The ﬁrst zero crossing
(after the origin) occurs at 1.22π.
The intensity pattern described by (11.16) contains the factor 2J1 (ξ)/ξ (which

we call the jinc2), where ξ represents the combination kDρ/2f . As noticed in
Fig. 11.7, J1 (ξ) goes to zero at ξ = 0. Thus, we have a zero-divided-by-zero sit-
uation similar to the sinc function (i.e. sin(ξ)/ξ), which approaches one at the
origin. The square of the jinc, shown in Fig. 11.7b, is proportional to the intensity
described in (11.16). This pattern is sometimes called an Airy pattern after Sir
George Biddell Airy (English, 1801–1892) who ﬁrst described the pattern. As can
be seen in Fig. 11.7b, the intensity quickly drops at larger radii.
We now return to the question of whether the images of two nearby stars
as depicted in Fig. 11.6 can be distinguished. Since the peak in Fig. 11.7b is the
dominant feature in the diffraction pattern, we will say that the two stars are
resolved if the angle between them is enough to keep their diffracted versions of
their images from seriously overlapping. We will adopt the criterion suggested by
Lord Rayleigh that the peaks are distinguishable if the peak of one pattern is no
closer than the ﬁrst zero to the other peak. This situation is shown in Fig. 11.8.
The angle that corresponds to this separation of diffraction patterns is found
by setting the argument of (11.16) equal to 1.22π, the location of the ﬁrst zero:
kDρ
2f
= 1.22π
(11.17)
With a little rearranging we have
θmin ∼= ρ
f = 1.22λ
D
(11.18)
Here we have associated the ratio ρ/f (i.e. the radius of the diffraction pattern
compared to the distance from the lens) with an angle θmin. Again, the angle
between the images (referenced from the lens) and the angle between the ob-
jects is the same. The Rayleigh criterion requires that the diffraction patterns be
separated by at least this angle before we say that they are resolved.
θmin depends on the diameter of the lens D as well as on the wavelength of
the light. This analysis assumes that the light from the two objects is incoherent,
meaning the intensities in the image plane add; interferences between the two
ﬁelds ﬂuctuate rapidly in time and average away.

Example 11.1
What minimum telescope-lens diameter is required to distinguish a Jupiter-like
planet (orbital radius 8×108 km) from its star if they are 10 light-years away?

This seems like a piece of cake; a telescope with a diameter bigger than 7cm will
do the trick. However, the vastly unequal brightness of the star and the planet is

the real technical challenge. The diffraction rings in the star’s diffraction pattern
completely swamp the faint signal from the planet.
11.3
The Array Theorem
In this section we develop the array theorem, which is used for calculating the
Fraunhofer diffraction from an array of N identical apertures. We will be using
the theorem to compute diffraction from a grating, which may be thought of as a
mask with many closely spaced identical slits. However, the array theorem can be
applied to apertures with any shape and conﬁguration, as suggested by Fig. 11.9.
Figure 11.9 Array of identical aper-
tures.
Consider N apertures in a mask, each with the identical ﬁeld distribution
described by Eaperture(x′, y′,0). Each identical aperture has a unique location on
the mask. Let the location of the nth aperture be designated by the coordinates
¡

. The ﬁeld associated with the nth aperture is then Eaperture(x′−x′

where the offset in the arguments shifts the location of the aperture. The ﬁeld

For the sake of elegance, we have traded back x′ for x′′ and y′ for y′′ as the

that the second factor in brackets is exactly the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern
from a single aperture centered on x′ = 0 and y′ = 0. When more than one
identical aperture is present, we only need to evaluate the Fraunhofer diffraction
formula for a single aperture. Then, the single-aperture result is multiplied by the
summation in front, which contains entirely the information about the placement
of the (many) identical apertures.

3A somewhat abstract alternative route to the array theorem recognizes that the ﬁeld for
each aperture can be written as a 2-D convolution (see P0.26) between the aperture function

The integral in (11.20) therefore may be viewed as a 2-D Fourier transform of a convolution, where
kx/z and ky/z play the role of spatial frequencies. The convolution theorem (see P0.26) indicates
that this is the same as the product of Fourier transforms. The 2-D Fourier transform for the delta

Diffraction Grating
In this section we will use the array theorem to calculate the Fraunhofer diffraction
from a grating comprised of an array of equally spaced identical slits. An array of
uniformly spaced slits is called a transmission grating (see Fig. 11.11). Reﬂection
gratings are similar, being composed of an array of narrow rectangular mirrors
that behave similarly to the slits.

This is the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for the overall grating.
The y dependence in (11.26) is typically unimportant in applications where

sinα = N so we have placed N 2 in the denominator and absorbed

It is left as an exercise to study the functional form of (11.27), especially how
the number of slits N inﬂuences the behavior. The case of N = 2 describes
the diffraction pattern for a Young’s double slit experiment. We now have a
description of the Young’s two-slit pattern in the case that the slits have ﬁnite
openings of width ∆x rather than inﬁnitely narrow ones.

The formula (11.27) can be exploited to make wavelength measurements. This
forms the basis of a diffraction grating spectrometer. In order to achieve good spa-
tial separation between wavelengths, it is necessary to allow the light to propagate
a far distance. Optimal wavelength separation therefore occurs in the Fraunhofer
regime for which (11.27) applies.
A spectrometer has relatively poor resolving power compared to a Fabry-Perot
interferometer. Nevertheless, a spectrometer is not hampered by the serious
limitation imposed by free spectral range. A spectrometer is able to measure a
wide range of wavelengths simultaneously. The Fabry-Perot interferometer and
the grating spectrometer in this sense are complementary, the one being able
to make very precise measurements within a narrow wavelength range and the
other being able to characterize wide ranges of wavelengths simultaneously.
To appreciate how a spectrometer works, consider Fraunhofer diffraction
from a grating, as described by (11.27). The structure of the diffraction pattern
has various peaks. For example, Fig. 11.12a shows the diffraction peaks from a
Young’s double slit (i.e. N = 2). The diffraction pattern is comprised of the typical
Young’s double-slit pattern multiplied by the diffraction pattern of a single slit.
(Note that sin2 ³

.)
As the number of slits N increases, the peaks tend to sharpen while staying in
the same location as the peaks in the Young’s double-slit pattern. Figure 11.12b
shows the case for N = 5. The prominent peaks occur when sin(πhx/λz) in the
denominator of (11.27) goes to zero. Keep in mind that the numerator goes to
zero at the same places, creating a zero-over-zero situation, so the peaks are not
inﬁnitely tall.

286
Chapter 11 Diffraction Applications
With larger values of N, the peaks can become extremely sharp, and the small
secondary peaks in between become tiny in comparison. Fig. 11.12c shows the
case of N = 10 and Fig. 11.12d, shows the case of N = 100.
When very many slits are used, the resulting sharp diffraction peaks becomes
very useful for measuring spectra of light, since the position of the diffraction
peaks depends on wavelength (except for the center peak at x = 0). If light of differ-
ent wavelengths is simultaneously present, then the diffraction peaks associated
with different wavelengths appear in different locations.
Consider the inset in Fig. 11.12d, which gives a close-up view of the ﬁrst-order
diffraction peak for N = 100. The location of this peak on a distant screen varies
with the wavelength of the light. How much must the wavelength change to cause
the peak to move by half of its ‘width’ as marked in the inset of Fig. 11.12d? This
corresponds to the minimum wavelength separation that allows two associated
peaks to be distinguished.
Figure 11.13 Animation showing
diffraction through a number of
slits.
Finding the Minimum Distinguishable Wavelength Separation
As mentioned, the main diffraction peaks occur when the denominator of (11.27)
goes to zero, i.e.
πhx
λz = mπ
(11.28)
The numerator of (11.27) goes to zero at these same locations (i.e. Nπhx/λz =
Nmπ), so the peaks remain ﬁnite. If two nearby wavelengths λ1 and λ2 are sent
through the grating simultaneously, their mth peaks are located at
x1 = mzλ1
h
and
x2 = mzλ2
h
(11.29)
These are spatially separated by
∆xλ ≡x2 −x1 = mz
h ∆λ
(11.30)
where ∆λ ≡λ2 −λ1.
Meanwhile, we can ﬁnd the spatial width of, say, the ﬁrst peak by considering the
change in x1 that causes the sine in the numerator of (11.27) to reach the nearby
zero (see inset in Fig. 11.12d). This condition implies
N

¡
x1 +∆xpeak
¢
λ1z

(11.31)
We will say that two peaks, associated with λ1 and λ2, are barely distinguishable
when ∆xλ = ∆xpeak. We also substitute from (11.29) to rewrite (11.31) as
N πh (mzλ1/h +mz∆λ/h)
λ1z

⇒
∆λ =

(11.32)
Here we have dropped the subscript on the wavelength in the spirit of λ1 ≈λ2 ≈λ.

11.5 Spectrometers
287
As we did for the Fabry-Perot interferometer, we can deﬁne the resolving
power of the diffraction grating as
RP ≡λ
∆λ = mN
(11.33)
The resolving power is proportional to the number of slits illuminated on the
diffraction grating. The resolving power also improves for higher diffraction
orders m.
Example 11.3
What is the resolving power with m = 1 of a 2-cm-wide grating with 500 slits per
millimeter, and how wide is the 1st-order diffraction peak for 500-nm light after
1-m focusing?
Solution: From (11.33) the resolving power is
RP = mN = 2 cm
500
0.1 cm = 104
and the minimum distinguishable wavelength separation is
∆λ = λ/RP = 500 nm/104 = 0.05 nm
From (11.30), with z →f , we have
∆x = m f
h ∆λ =
1 m
2×10−6 m0.05nm = 25 µm
As illustrated in the previous example, it is common to employ a focusing
optic to reach the Fraunhofer limit within a convenient distance. In addition,
since the array theorem requires the same illumination of each slit, the incident
light should be collimated or plane-wave like. This is also accomplished using
a lens. Fig. 11.14 illustrates the typical layout. Light enters a narrow slit located
at the focus of a concave mirror. The collimated light then strikes a reﬂective
diffraction grating. The ﬁrst-order diffracted light is then focused by a second
concave mirror where the Fraunhofer diffraction of the grating appears. If a
CCD camera is positioned at the focus to record many wavelengths at once, the
instrument is called a spectrometer. If instead an exit slit is placed at the focus
so that only one wavelength at a time emerges through the slit, the instrument
is called a monochromator. In the latter case, the angle of the grating can be
scanned to cause different wavelengths to transmit through the exit slit.

consider the intensity of the above ﬁeld distribution:

(11.35)
where ρ′2 ≡x′2 + y′2. In (11.35) we see that w0 indicates the radius at which the
intensity reduces by the factor e−2 = 0.135.

We would like to know how this ﬁeld evolves when it propagates forward from
the plane z = 0. Notice that the phase of (11.34) is uniform or plane-wave like. We
therefore expect the beam to expand outward as it diffracts along z.4 We compute
the ﬁeld downstream using the Fresnel approximation (10.13):

(11.44)
This formula describes the lowest-order Gaussian mode, the most common laser
beam proﬁle.5
It turns out that (11.40) works equally well for negative values of z. The
expression can therefore be used to describe the ﬁeld of a simple laser beam
everywhere (before and after it goes through a focus). In fact, the expression works
also near z = 0! At z = 0 the diffracted ﬁeld (11.40) returns the exact expression for
the original ﬁeld proﬁle (11.34) (see P11.11).There is good reason for this since
the Fresnel diffraction integral is an exact solution to the paraxial wave equation
(10.15). The beam (11.40) satisﬁes the paraxial wave equation for positive and
negative z. In short, (11.40) may be used with impunity as long as the divergence
angle of the beam is not too wide.
5Lasers can also be multimode, exhibiting more complicated structure through ‘higher-order’
modes.

Figure 11.16 A Gaussian laser ﬁeld
proﬁle in the vicinity of its beam
waist.
By inspection, we see that w (z) gives the radius of the beam anywhere along
z. At z = 0, the beam waist, w (z = 0) reduces to w0, as expected. The parameter
z0, known as the Rayleigh range, speciﬁes the distance along the axis from z = 0
to the point where the intensity decreases by a factor of 2. Note that w0 and z0
are not independent of each other but are connected through the wavelength
according to (11.44). There is a tradeoff: a small beam waist means a short depth
of focus. That is, a small w0 means a small Rayleigh range z0.
We next consider the phase terms that appear in the ﬁeld expression (11.40).
The phase term ikz + ikρ2/2R (z) describes the phase of curved wave fronts,
where R (z) is the radius of curvature of the wave front at z. The curvature of
wavefronts is evident in Fig. 11.17. At z = 0, the radius of curvature is inﬁnite (see
(11.43)), meaning that the wave front is ﬂat at the laser beam waist. In contrast,
at very large values of z we have R (z) ∼= z (see (11.43)). In this case, we may
write these phase terms as kz + kρ2
2z ∼= k
p
z2 +ρ2. This describes a spherical wave
front emanating from the origin out to point
¡
ρ,z
¢
. The Fresnel approximation
represents spherical wave fronts as parabolic curves (same as the paraxial ap-
proximation). As a reminder, to restore the temporal dependence of the ﬁeld, we
append e−iωt to the solution, as discussed in connection with (10.4).
The phase −i tan−1 z/z0 is perhaps a bit more mysterious. It is called the Gouy
shift and is actually present for any light that goes through a focus, not just laser
beams. The Gouy shift is not overly dramatic since the expression tan−1 z/z0
ranges from −π/2 (at z = −∞) to π/2 (at z = +∞). Nevertheless, when light goes
through a focus, it experiences an overall phase shift of π.

Write the beam waist w0 in terms of the f-number, deﬁned to be the ratio of z to
the beam diameter 2w(z) far from the beam waist.
Solution: Far away from the beam waist (i.e. z >> z0) the laser beam expands
along a cone. That is, its diameter increases in proportion to distance.

(11.46)
Equation (11.46) gives a convenient way to predict the size of a laser focus.
One calculates the f-number by dividing the diameter of the beam far from the
focus into the distance from the focus. In practice you may be very surprised at
how poorly a beam may focus in comparison with the theoretical prediction (due
to aberrations). It is always good practice to directly measure your focus if its size
is important to an experiment.
Appendix 11.A
ABCD Law for Gaussian Beams
In this section we discuss and justify the ABCD law for Gaussian beams. The
law enables one to predict the parameters of a Gaussian beam that exits from an
optical system, given the parameters of an input Gaussian beam. To make the
prediction, one needs only the ABCD matrix for the optical system, taken as a
whole. The system may be arbitrarily complex with many optical components.
At ﬁrst, it may seem unlikely that such a prediction should be possible since
ABCD matrices were introduced to describe the propagation of rays. On the other
hand, Gaussian beams are governed by the laws of diffraction. As an example of
this dichotomy, consider a collimated Gaussian beam that traverses a converging
lens. By ray theory, one expects the Gaussian beam to focus near the focal point
of the lens. However, a collimated beam by deﬁnition is already in the act of going
through focus. In the absence of the lens, there is a tendency for the beam to grow
via diffraction, especially if the beam waist is small. This tendency competes with
the focusing effect of the lens, and a new beam waist can occur at a wide range of
locations, depending on the exact outcome of this competition.
A Gaussian beam is characterized by its Rayleigh range z0. From this, the
beam waist radius w0 may be extracted via (11.44), assuming the wavelength is
known. Suppose that a Gaussian beam encounters an optical system at position

z, referenced to the position of the beam’s waist as shown in Fig. 11.19. The beam
exiting from the system, in general, has a new Rayleigh range z′
0. The waist of the
new beam also occurs at a different location. Let z′ denote the location of the exit
of the optical system, referenced to the location of the waist of the new beam. If
the exiting beam diverges as in Fig. 11.19, then it emerges from a virtual beam
waist located before the exit point of the system. In this case, z′ is taken to be
positive. On the other hand, if the emerging beam converges to an actual waist,
then z′ is taken to be negative since the exit point of the system occurs before the
focus.
The ABCD law is embodied in the following relationship:
z′ +iz′
0 = A(z +iz0)+B
C (z +iz0)+D
(11.47)
where A, B, C, and D are the matrix elements of the optical system. The imaginary
number i ≡
p
−1 imbues the law with complex arithmetic. It makes two equations
from one, since the real and imaginary parts of (11.47) must separately be equal.
We now prove the ABCD law. We begin by showing that the law holds for
two speciﬁc ABCD matrices. First, consider the matrix for propagation through a

We know that simple propagation has minimal effect on a beam. The Rayleigh
range is unchanged, so we expect that the ABCD law should give z′
0 = z0. The
propagation through a distance d modiﬁes the beam position by z′ = z +d. We
now check that the ABCD law agrees with these results by inserting (11.48) into
(11.47):
z′ +iz′
0 = 1(z +iz0)+d
0(z +iz0)+1 = z +d +iz0 (propagation through distance d) (11.49)
Thus, the law holds in this case.

A beam that traverses a thin lens undergoes the phase shift −kρ2/2f , according
to (11.11). This modiﬁes the original phase of the wave front kρ2/2R (z), seen in
(11.40). The phase of the exiting beam is therefore
kρ2
2R (z′) = kρ2

where we do not keep track of unimportant overall phases such as kz or kz′. With

It is left as an exercise (see P11.14) to show that (11.54) is consistent with (11.52)
and (11.53).
So far we have shown that the ABCD law works for two speciﬁc examples,
namely propagation through a distance d and transmission through a thin lens
with focal length f . From these elements we can derive more complicated sys-
tems. However, the ABCD matrix for a thick lens cannot be constructed from just
these two elements. However, we can construct the matrix for a thick lens if we
sandwich a thick window (as opposed to empty space) between two thin lenses.
The proof that the matrix for a thick window obeys the ABCD law is left as an
exercise (see P11.17). With these relatively few elements, essentially any optical
system can be constructed, provided that the beam propagation begins and ends
in the same index of refraction.

P11.3
On the night of April 18, 1775, a signal was sent from the Old North
Church steeple to Paul Revere, who was 1.8 miles away: “One if by
land, two if by sea.” If in the dark, Paul’s pupils had 4 mm diameters,
what is the minimum possible separation between the two lanterns
that would allow him to correctly interpret the signal? Assume that the
predominant wavelength of the lanterns was 580 nm.
HINT: You don’t need to worry about refractive index inside the eye,
n = 1.33. This causes the angular separation between the images to be
θ/1.33 inside the eye. The wavelength also shortens to 580 nm/1.33,
causing a smaller diffraction pattern. As far as resolution is concerned,
the two effects exactly compensate.

after a short distance. Use a CCD camera to study this focused beam.
The collimated beam serves as a reference to reveal the phase of the
focused beam through interference. Because the weak ghost beam
concentrates near its focus, the two beams can have similar intensities
for optimal fringe visibility. (video)6

is given by (11.45). We now have a formula that retains

(b) Measure the actual spot size w0 at the focus. How does it compare
to the prediction?
HINT: Before measuring the spot size, make a subtle adjustment to
the tilt of the lens. This incidentally causes the phase between the two
beams to vary by small amounts, which you can set to φ = ±π/2. Then
at the focus the cosine term vanishes and the two beams don’t interfere
(i.e. the intensities simply add). This is accomplished if the center of
the interference pattern is as dark as possible either far before or far
after the focus.
(c) Observe the effect of the Gouy shift. Since tan−1 z/z0 varies over a
range of π, you should see that the ring pattern inverts as you move
the camera from before the focus to after the focus (i.e. the bright rings
exchange with the dark ones).
(d) Predict the Rayleigh range z0 and check that the radius of curvature
R (z) ≡z + z2
0 /z agrees with measurement.
HINT: You should see interference rings similar to those in Fig. 11.26.
The only phase term that varies with ρ is kρ2/2R (z). If you count N
fringes out to a radius ρ, then kρ2/2R (z) has varied by 2πN.

Chapter 12
Interferograms and Holography
In chapter 8, we studied a Michelson interferometer in an idealized sense: 1) The
light entering the instrument was considered to be a plane wave. 2) The retro-
reﬂecting mirrors were considered to be aligned perpendicular to the beams
impinging on them. 3) All reﬂective surfaces were taken to be perfectly ﬂat. If any
of these conditions are not met, the beam emerging from the interferometer is
likely to exhibit an interference or fringe pattern. A recorded fringe pattern (for
example, on a CCD camera) is called an interferogram. In this chapter, we examine
typical fringe patterns that can be produced in an interferometer. Such patterns
are very useful for testing the prescription and quality of optical components.1
We will also study holography, where an interference pattern (or fringe pat-
tern) is recorded and then later used to diffract light, in much the same way that
gratings diffract light.2 A recorded fringe pattern, when used for this purpose,
is called a hologram. When light diffracts from a hologram, it can mimic the
light ﬁeld originally used to generate the fringe pattern. This is true even for
complicated ﬁelds, recorded when light scatters from arbitrary three-dimensional
objects. When the light ﬁeld is re-created through diffraction, the resulting image
looks ‘three-dimensional’, since the holographic fringes re-construct the original
light ﬁeld over a wide range of viewing angles.

Consider the Michelson interferometer seen in Fig. 12.1. Suppose that the beam-
spliter divides the ﬁelds evenly, so that the overall output intensity is given by
(8.1):
Itot = 2I0 [1+cos(ωτ)]
(12.1)
As a reminder, τ is the roundtrip delay time of one path relative to the other. This
equation is based on the idealized case, where the amplitude and phase of the two

University Press, 1999).

employed to produce gratings.

What happens if one of the retro-reﬂecting mirrors is misaligned by a small
angle θ? The fringe patterns seen in Fig. 12.2 (a)-(c) are the result. By the law
of reﬂection, the beam returning from the misaligned mirror deviates from the
‘ideal’ path by an angle 2θ. This puts a relative phase variation of
φ = kx sin(2θx)+ky sin
¡

¢
(12.2)
on the misaligned beam.3 Here θx represents the tilt of the mirror in the x-
dimension and θy represents the amount of tilt in the y-dimension.
When the two plane waves join, the resulting intensity pattern is
Itot = 2I0
£
1+cos
¡

¢¤
(12.3)
The phase term φ depends on the local position within the beam through x and
y. Regions of uniform phase, called fringes (in this case individual stripes), have
the same intensity. As the delay τ is varied, the fringes seem to ‘move’ across the
detector. In this case, the fringes appear at one edge of the beam and disappear
at the other.
Another interesting situation arises when the beams in a Michelson interfer-
ometer are diverging. A fringe pattern of concentric circles will be seen at the
detector when the two beam paths are unequal (see Fig. 12.2 (d)). The radius of
curvature for the beam traveling the longer path is increased by the added amount
of delay d = τc. Thus, if beam 1 has radius of curvature R1 when returning to the
beam splitter, then beam 2 will have radius R2 = R1+d upon return (assuming ﬂat
mirrors). The relative phase (see phase term in (11.40)) between the two beams is
φ = kρ2/2R1 −kρ2/2R2
(12.4)
and the intensity pattern at the detector is given as before by (12.3).
12.2
Testing Optical Surfaces
A Michelson interferometer is ideal for testing the quality of optical surfaces. If
any of the ﬂat surfaces (including the beam splitter) in the interferometer are
distorted, the fringe pattern readily reveals it. Figure 12.3 shows an example of a
fringe pattern when one of the mirrors in the interferometer has an arbitrary de-
formity in the surface ﬁgure.4 A new fringe stripe occurs for every half wavelength
that the surface varies. (The round trip turns a half wavelength into a whole
wavelength.) This makes it possible to determine the ﬂatness of a surface with
very high precision. Of course, in order to test a given surface in an interferometer,
the quality of all other surfaces in the interferometer must ﬁrst be ensured.
3This ignores an additive constant for ﬁxed z.
4The surface ﬁgure is a name for how well a surface contour matches a desired prescription.

12.3 Generating Holograms
303
A typical industry standard for research-grade optics is to specify the surface
ﬂatness to within one tenth of an optical wavelength (633 nm HeNe laser). This
means that the interferometer should reveal no more than one ﬁfth of a fringe
variation across the substrate surface. The fringe pattern tells the technician how
the surface should continue to be polished in order to achieve the desired surface
ﬂatness. Figure 12.3(a) shows the fringe pattern for a surface with signiﬁcant
variations in the surface ﬁgure.
(a)
(b)
Figure 12.3 (a) Fringe pattern aris-
ing from an arbitrarily distorted
mirror in a perfectly aligned inter-
ferometer with plane wave beams.
(b) Fringe pattern from the same
mirror as (a) when the mirror is
tilted (still plane wave beams).
The distortion due to surface varia-
tion is still easily seen.
When testing a surface, it is not necessary to remove all tilt from the alignment
before the effects of surface variations become apparent in the fringe pattern. In
fact, it can be helpful to observe the distortions as deﬂections in a normally regu-
larly striped fringe pattern. Figure 12.3(b) shows fringes from the same distorted
surface when some tilt is left in the interferometer alignment. An important
advantage to leaving some tilt in the beam is that one can better tell the sign of
the phase errors. We can see, for example, in the case of tilt that the two major
distortion regions in Fig. 12.3 have opposite phase; we can tell that one region of
the substrate protrudes while the other dishes in. On the other hand, this is not
clear for an interferogram with no tilt.
Other types of optical components (besides ﬂat mirrors) can also be tested
with an interferometer. Figure 12.4 shows how a lens can be tested using a
convex mirror to compensate for the focusing action of the lens. With appropriate
spacing, the lens-mirror combination can act like a ﬂat surface. Distortions in the
lens ﬁgure are revealed in the fringe pattern. In this case, the surfaces of the lens
are tested together, and variations in optical path length are observed. In order
to record fringes, say with a CCD camera, it is often convenient to image a larger
beam onto a relatively small active area of the detector. The imaging objective
should be adjusted to produce an image of the test optic on the detector screen.
The diameter of the objective lens needs to accommodate the whole beam.

Generating Holograms
In the late 1940’s, Dennis Gabor developed the concept of holography, but it wasn’t
until after the invention of the laser that this ﬁeld really blossomed. Consider
a coherent monochromatic beam of light that is split in half by a beamsplitter,
similar to that in a Michelson interferometer. Let one beam, called the reference
beam, proceed directly to a recording ﬁlm, and let the other beam scatter from
an arbitrary object back towards the same ﬁlm. The two beams interfere at the
recording ﬁlm. It is best to split the beam initially into unequal intensities such
that the light scattered from the object has an intensity similar to the reference
beam at the ﬁlm.
The purpose of the ﬁlm is to record the interference pattern. It is important
that the coherence length of the light be much longer than the difference in
path length starting from the beam splitter and ending at the ﬁlm. In addition,
during exposure to the ﬁlm, it is important that the whole setup be stable against
vibrations on the scale of a wavelength since this will cause the fringes to wash

304
Chapter 12 Interferograms and Holography
out. For simplicity, we neglect the vector nature of the electric ﬁeld, assuming
that the scattering from the object for the most part preserves polarization and
that the angle between the two beams incident on the ﬁlm is modest (so that the
electric ﬁelds of the two beams are close to parallel). To the extent that the light
scattered from the object contains the polarization component orthogonal to that
of the reference beam, it provides a uniform (unwanted) background exposure to
the ﬁlm on top of which the fringe pattern is recorded.

Figure 12.5 Exposure of holo-
graphic ﬁlm.
In general terms, we may write the electric ﬁeld arriving at the ﬁlm as5
Eﬁlm (r)e−iωt = Eobject (r)e−iωt +Eref (r)e−iωt
(12.5)
Here, the coordinate r indicates locations on the ﬁlm surface, which may have
arbitrary shape but often is a plane. The ﬁeld Eobject(r), which is scattered from
the object, is in general very complicated. The ﬁeld Eref(r) may be equally compli-
cated, but typically it is convenient if it has a simple form such as a plane wave,
since this beam must be re-created later in order to view the hologram.
Dennis Gabor (19001979, Hungarian)
was born in Budapest. As a teenager,
he fought for Hungary in World War
I. Following the war, he studied at the
Technical University of Budapest and
later at the Technical University of
Berlin. In 1927, Gabor completed his
doctoral dissertation on cathode ray
tubes and began a long career work-
ing on electron-beam devices such as
oscilloscopes, televisions, and electron
microscopes. It was in the context of
`electron optics' that he invented the
concept of holography, which relied on
the wave nature of electron beams. Ga-
bor did this work while working for a
British company, after eeing Germany
when Hitler came to power. Holography
did not become practical until after the
invention of the laser, which provided
a bright coherent light source. (Gabor
had attempted to make holograms ear-
lier using a spectral line from a mercury
lamp.) In 1964 the rst hologram was
produced. Soon after, holograms be-
came commercially available and were
popularized. Gabor accepted a post as
professor of applied physics at the Impe-
rial College of London from 1958 until
he retired in 1967. He was awarded the
Nobel prize in physics in 1971 for the
invention of holography. (Wikipedia)

For typical photographic ﬁlm, the exposure of the ﬁlm is proportional to the
intensity of the light hitting it. This is known as the linear response regime. That
is, after the ﬁlm is developed, the transmittance T of the light through the ﬁlm is
proportional to the intensity of the light that exposed it (Iﬁlm). However, for low
exposure levels, or for ﬁlm speciﬁcally designed for holography, the transmission
of the light through the ﬁlm can be proportional to the square of the intensity
of the light that exposes the ﬁlm. Thus, after the ﬁlm is exposed to the fringe
pattern and developed, the ﬁlm acquires a spatially varying transmission function
according to
T (r) ∝I 2
ﬁlm(r)
(12.7)
If at a later point in time light of intensity Iincident is directed onto the ﬁlm, it will
transmit according to Itransmitted = T (r)Iincident. In this case, the ﬁeld, as it emerges
from the other side of the ﬁlm, will be
Etransmitted (r) = t (r)Eincident (r) ∝Iﬁlm (r)Eincident (r)
(12.8)
where t (r) =

T (r).

Holographic Wavefront Reconstruction
To see a holographic image, we re-illuminate ﬁlm (previously exposed and devel-
oped) with the original reference beam. That is, we send in
Eincident (r) = Eref (r)

struction of wavefront through
diffraction from fringes on ﬁlm.
Compare with Fig. 12.5.
Although (12.10) looks fairly complicated, each of the three terms has a direct
interpretation. The ﬁrst term is just the reference beam Eref (r) with an amplitude
modiﬁed by the transmission through the ﬁlm. It is the residual undeﬂected beam,
similar to zero-order diffraction through a transmission grating. The second term
is interpreted as a reconstruction of the light ﬁeld originally scattered from the
object Eobject (r). Its amplitude is modiﬁed by the intensity of the reference beam,
but if the reference beam is uniform across the ﬁlm, this hardly matters. An
observer looking into the ﬁlm sees a wavefront identical to the one produced
by the original object (superimposed with the other ﬁelds in (12.10)). Thus,
the observer sees a virtual image at the location of the original object. Since
the wavefront of the original object has genuinely been recreated, the image
looks ‘three-dimensional’, because the observer is free to view from different
perspectives.
The ﬁnal term in (12.10) is proportional to the complex conjugate of the
original ﬁeld from the object. It also contains twice the phase of the reference
beam, which we can overlook if the reference beam is uniform on the ﬁlm. In
this case, the complex conjugate of the object ﬁeld actually converges to a real
image of the original object. This image is located on the observer’s side of the
ﬁlm, but it is often of less interest since the image is ‘inside out’. An ideal screen
for viewing this real image would be an item shaped similar to the original object,
which of course defeats the purpose of the hologram! To the extent that the ﬁlm is
not ﬂat or to the extent that the reference beam is not a plane wave, the phase of
E2
ref (r) severely distorts the image. On the other hand, the virtual image previously
described never suffers from this problem.

Example 12.1
Analyze the three ﬁeld terms in (12.10) for a hologram made from a point object,

Solution: Presumably, the point object is illuminated sufﬁciently brightly so as to
make the scattered light have an intensity similar to the reference beam at the ﬁlm.
Let the reference plane wave strike the ﬁlm at normal incidence. Then the reference
ﬁeld will have constant amplitude and phase across it; call it Eref. The ﬁeld from
the point object can be treated as a spherical wave:

We see the three distinct waves that emerge from the holographic ﬁlm. The ﬁrst
term in (12.12) represents the plane wave reference beam passing straight through
the ﬁlm with some variation in amplitude (depicted in Fig. 12.8 (a)). The second
term in (12.12) has the identical form as the ﬁeld from the original object (aside
from an overall amplitude factor). It describes an outward-expanding spherical
wave, which gives rise to a virtual image at the location of the original point object,
as depicted in Fig. 12.8 (b). The ﬁnal term in (12.12) corresponds to a converging
spherical wave, which focuses to a point at a distance L from the observer’s side of
the screen (depicted in Fig. 12.8 (c)).

Chapter 13
Blackbody Radiation
Gustav Kirchho (18241887, German)
was born in Konigsberg, the son of a
lawyer. Kirchho attended the Univer-
sity of Konigsberg. While still a student,
he developed what are now called Kirch-
ho's law for electrical circuits. During
his career, Kirchho was a professor in
Breslau, Heidelberg, and nally Berlin.
Kirchho was one of the rst to study
the spectra emitted by various objects
when heated. Not coincidentally, his
colleague in Heidelberg was Robert
Bunsen, inventor of the Bunsen burner.
Kirchho coined the term `blackbody'
radiation. He demonstrated that an ex-
cited gas gives o a discrete spectrum,
and that an unexcited gas surrounding
a blackbody emitter produces dark lines
in the blackbody spectrum. Together
Kirchho and Bunsen discovered cae-
sium and rubidium. Later in his career,
Kirchho showed how to derive Fres-
nel's diraction formula starting from
the wave equation. (Wikipedia)
Hot objects glow. In 1860, Kirchhoff proposed that the radiation emitted by hot
objects as a function of frequency is approximately the same for all materials.1
The notion that all materials behave similarly led to the concept of an ideal
blackbody radiator. Most materials have a certain shininess that causes light to
reﬂect or scatter in addition to being absorbed and reemitted. However, light
that falls upon an ideal blackbody is absorbed perfectly before the possibility of
reemission, hence the name blackbody.
The distribution of frequencies emitted by a blackbody radiator is related
to its temperature. We often consider a blackbody radiator that is in thermal
equilibrium with the surrounding light that is absorbed and reemitted. If it is
not in thermal equilibrium, for example, if more light is emitted than absorbed,
then the object inevitably cools as light escapes to the environment, moving the
system toward thermal equilibrium.
The Sun is a good example of a blackbody radiator. The light emitted from the
Sun is associated with its surface temperature. Any light that arrives to the Sun
from outer space is virtually 100% absorbed, however little light that might be, so
the name blackbody aptly describes it. Mostly, light escapes to the much colder
surrounding space (i.e. it is not in thermal equilibrium), and the temperature of
the Sun’s surface is maintained by the fusion process within. As another example,
a glowing tungsten ﬁlament in an ordinary light bulb may be reasonably described
as a blackbody radiator. However, surface reﬂections make it less than ideal both
for absorption and emission.
Experimentally, a near perfect blackbody radiator can be constructed from
a hollow object. An example is shown in Fig. 13.1. As the interior of the object
is heated, the light present inside the internal cavity is in equilibrium with the
glowing walls. A small hole can be drilled through the wall to observe the radiation
inside without signiﬁcantly disturbing the system. The observation hole can be
thought of as a perfect blackbody since any light entering the hole from the
outside is eventually absorbed (before being potentially reemitted), if not on the
1An important exception is atomic vapors, which have relatively few discrete spectral lines.
However, Kirchhoff’s assumption holds quite well for most solids, which are sufﬁciently complex.

ﬁrst bounce then on subsequent bounces inside the cavity.
In this chapter, we develop a theoretical understanding of blackbody radiation
and provide some historical perspective. The explanation given by Max Planck
in 1900 marks the birth of quantum mechanics. He postulated the existence of
electromagnetic quanta, which we now call photons. Einstein used Planck’s ideas
to explain the photoelectric effect and to develop the concept of stimulated and
spontaneous emission. Because of his analysis, Einstein can be thought of as the
father (or maybe grandfather) of light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of
radiation (LASER).
Figure 13.1 Blackbody radiator.
Thermal light emerges from the
small hole in the end.
13.1
Stefan-Boltzmann Law
One of the earliest properties deduced about blackbody radiation is known as the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, ﬁrst suggested by Stefan in 1879 and derived thermody-
namically by Boltzmann in 1884.2 This early (somewhat cumbersome) derivation
is provided in appendix 13.A.3 The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that the intensity I
(including all frequencies) that ﬂows outward from an object’s surface is given by
I = eσT 4,
(13.1)
where σ is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temper-
ature (in Kelvin) of the surface. The value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is
σ = 5.6696×10−8 W/m2·K4. The dimensionless parameter e, called the emissivity,
is equal to one for an ideal blackbody surface. However, it takes on smaller values
for actual materials because of surface reﬂections. For example, the emissivity
of tungsten is approximately e = 0.4. This takes into account surface reﬂections,
which make it harder for a material to emit light as well as to absorb light.4
As was mentioned in the introduction, one can construct an ideal blackbody
radiator from a material with e < 1 by creating an enclosure, or cavity, as depicted
in Fig. 13.2. A small hole in the wall behaves to the outside world like an ideal
blackbody surface. From the perspective of the outside world, the hole’s ‘surface’
has emissivity e = 1. Light within the cavity recirculates until it is eventually
absorbed. The intensity emerging from the hole automatically approaches that of
an ideal blackbody radiator.
Figure 13.2 Blackbody radiator
constructed as a cavity with a
small hole to sample the internal
light.
It is sometimes useful to express intensity in terms of the energy density of the
light ﬁeld uﬁeld (given by (2.53) in units of energy per volume). The connection
between the intensity emerging from the observation hole of a blackbody cavity
and the energy density of the thermal light within the cavity is
I = cuﬁeld

2See P. W. Milonni, The Quantum Vacuum An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics, Sect.
1.2 (San Diego: Academic Press, 1994).
3It is less effort to obtain the Stefan-Boltzmann law using the Planck radiation formula as a
starting point (see P13.3).
4Emissivity typically has some frequency dependence, so what is presented here is an oversim-
pliﬁcation.

13.2 Failure of the Equipartition Principle
317
Within the enclosed cavity, light travels at speed c isotropically in all directions. A
factor of 1/2 arrises because only half of the energy travels towards the hole from
within the cavity as opposed to away. The remaining factor of 1/2 occurs because
the light emerging from the hole is directionally distributed over a hemisphere,
rather than ﬂowing in the direction of the surface normal ˆn. The average over the
hemisphere is carried out as follows:

(13.3)
Although (13.1) describes the total intensity of the light that leaves a blackbody
surface, it does not describe what frequencies make up the radiation ﬁeld. This
frequency distribution was not fully described for another two decades, when
Max Planck developed his famous formula. Planck was ﬁrst to arrive at the correct
formula for the spectrum of blackbody radiation, building on the work of others,
most notably Wien, who came very close. At ﬁrst, Planck tweaked Wien’s formula
to match newly available experimental data. When he attempted to explain
it, he was forced to introduce the concept of light quanta. Even Planck was
uncomfortable with and perhaps disbelieved the assumption that his formula
implied, but he deserves credit for recognizing and articulating it.
13.2
Failure of the Equipartition Principle
In 1900, Lord Rayleigh attempted to explain the blackbody spectral distribution
(intensity per frequency) as a function of temperature by applying the equipar-
tition theorem to the problem. James Jeans gave a more complete derivation in
1905, which included an overall proportionality constant. They were hopelessly
behind, since Planck nailed the answer in 1900, but their failed (classical) ap-
proach is useful pedagogically, and for that reason it gets more attention than it
deserves. In this section, we also will examine the Rayleigh-Jeans approach to
illustrate the shortcomings of classical concepts. This will help us better appreci-
ate the quantum ideas in the following section. As we will see, the Rayleigh-Jeans
approach actually gets the right answer in the long-wavelength limit. In fairness
to Rayleigh and Jeans, they represented their formula as being useful only for long
wavelengths.
The thermodynamic law of equipartition implies that the energy in a system
on the average is distributed equally among all degrees of freedom in the system.
For example, a system composed of oscillators (say, electrons attached to ‘springs’
representing the response of the material on the walls of a blackbody cavity)
has an energy of kBT /2 for each degree of freedom, where kB = 1.38×10−23J/K
is Boltzmann’s constant. Rayleigh and Jeans supposed that each unique mode
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld should carry energy kBT just as each mechanical
spring in thermal equilibrium carries energy kBT (kBT /2 as kinetic and kBT /2 as

potential energy). The problem then reduces to that of ﬁnding the number of
unique modes for the radiation at each frequency.5 The idea is that requiring each
mode of electromagnetic energy to hold energy kBT should reveal the spectral
shape of blackbody radiation.
Number of Modes in an Electromagnetic Field
Each frequency is associated with a wave-vector magnitude k =
q
k2x +k2y +k2z.
Notice that there are many ways (i.e. combinations of kx, ky, and kz) to come up
with the same k = ω/c. To count these ways properly, we can let our experience
with Fourier series guide us. Consider a box having length L on each side. The
Fourier theorem (0.42) states that the total ﬁeld inside the box (no matter how
complicated the distribution) can always be represented as a superposition of sine
(and cosine) waves. The total ﬁeld in the box can therefore be written as6

where each component of the wave number in any of the three dimensions is an
integer times
k0 = 2π/L
(13.5)
Considering a box of size L does not artiﬁcially restrict our analysis, since we may
later take the limit L →∞so that our box represents the entire universe. Moreover,
L will naturally disappear from our calculation when we later consider the density
of modes.

coordinate system with axes labeled n, m, and ℓ:

(13.6)
The fact that the integers n, m, and ℓrange over both positive and negative values
automatically takes into account that the ﬁeld may travel in the forwards or the
backwards direction.
We need to know how many more ways there are to choose n, m, and ℓwhen the
wave number k/k0 increases to (k +dk)/k0. The answer is the difference in the
volume of the two spheres shown in Fig. 13.3:

6The Fourier expansion 13.4 implies that the ﬁeld on the right and left of each dimension match
up, which is known as periodic boundary conditions.

According to the Rayleigh-Jeans assumption, each mode should carry on
average equal energy kBT . The energy density associated with a speciﬁed range of
wave numbers dk is then kBT /L3 times the number of modes within that range
(13.7).
The total energy density in the ﬁeld involving all wave numbers is then7

where the extra factor of 2 accounts for two independent polarizations, not speci-
ﬁed in (13.4). As anticipated, the dependence on L has disappeared from (13.8)
after substituting from (13.5).
James Jeans (18771946, English) was
born in Ormskirk, England. He attended
Cambridge University and later taught
there for most of his career. He also
taught at Princeton University for a
number of years. One of his major con-
tributions was the development of Jeans
length, the critical radius for interstel-
lar clouds, which determines whether
a cloud will collapse to form a star. In
his later career, Jeans became some-
what well known to the public for his
lay-audience books highlighting scien-
tic advances, in particular relativity
and cosmology. (Wikipedia)
We can immediately see that (13.8) disagrees drastically with the Stefan-
Boltzmann law (13.2), since (13.8) is proportional to temperature rather than
to its fourth power. In addition, the integral in (13.8) is seen to diverge, meaning
that regardless of the temperature, the light carries inﬁnite energy density! This
has since been named the ultraviolet catastrophe since the divergence occurs
on the short wavelength end of the spectrum. This is a clear failure of classical
physics to explain blackbody radiation. Nevertheless, Rayleigh emphasized the
fact that his formula works well for the longer wavelengths.
It is instructive to make the change of variables k = ω/c in the integral to write

Planck’s Formula
In the late 1800’s as spectrographic technology improved, experimenters acquired
considerable data on the spectra of blackbody radiation. For the ﬁrst time, de-
tailed maps of the intensity per frequency associated with blackbody radiation

Chapter 13 Blackbody Radiation
became available over a fairly wide wavelength range. In keeping with Kirchhoff’s
notion of an ideal blackbody radiator, the results were observed to be indepen-
dent of the material for most solids. The intensity per frequency depended only
on temperature and when integrated over all frequencies agreed with the Stefan-
Boltzmann law (13.1).
Wilhelm Wien (18641928, German)
was born in Gaken, Prussia (now Pri-
morsk, Russia). As a teenager, he at-
tended schools in Rastenburg and then
Heidelberg. He later attended the Uni-
versity of Göttingen and then the Uni-
versity of Berlin. In 1886, he received
his Ph.D. after working under Hermann
von Helmholtz where he studied the in-
uence of materials on the color of light.
In 1896 Wien developed an empirical
formula for the spectral distribution of
blackbody radiation. He collaborated
with Planck, who gave the law a foun-
dation in electromagnetic and thermody-
namic theory. Planck later improved the
formula, whereupon it became known by
his name. However, Wien's formula for
the peak wavelength of the blackbody
curve, called Wien's displacement law,
remains valid. In 1898, Wien identied
a positive particle equal in mass to the
hydrogen atom, which was later named
the proton. Wien received the Nobel
prize in 1911 for his work on heat and
radiation. (Wikipedia)
In 1896, Wilhelm Wien considered the known physical and mathematical
constraints on the spectrum of blackbody radiation and proposed a spectral
function that seemed to work:8
ρWien (ω) = ħω3e−ħω/kBT
π2c3
(13.12)
An important feature of (13.12) is that it gives a result proportional to T 4 when
integrated over all frequency ω (i.e. the Steffan-Boltzmann law).
Wien’s formula did a fairly good job of ﬁtting the experimental data. However,
in 1900 Lummer and Pringshein, colleagues of Max Planck, reported experimental
data that deviated from the Wien distribution at long wavelengths (infrared).
Planck was privy to this information early on and introduced a modest revision
to Wien’s formula that ﬁt the data beautifully everywhere:
ρPlanck (ω) =
ħω3
π2c3 £
eħω/kBT −1
¤
(13.13)
where ħ = 1.054×10−34J·s is an experimentally determined constant.9
Figure 13.4 shows the Planck spectral distribution curve together with the
Rayleigh-Jeans curve (13.11) and the Wien curve (13.12). As is apparent, the Wien
distribution does a good job nearly everywhere. However, at long wavelengths
it was off by just enough for the experimentalists to notice that something was
wrong.
At this point, it may seem fair to ask, “What did Planck do that was so great?”
After all, he simply guessed a function that was only a slight modiﬁcation of
Wien’s distribution. And he knew the ‘answer from the back of the book’, namely
Lummer’s and Pringshein’s well done experimental results. (At the time, Planck
was unaware of the work by Rayleigh.)

Planck gets well-deserved credit for interpreting the meaning of his new
formula. His interpretation was what he called an “act of desperation.” He did
not necessarily believe in the implications of his formula; in fact, he presented
them somewhat apologetically. It was several years later that the young Einstein
published his paper explaining the photoelectric effect in the context of Planck’s
work.
Planck’s insight was an enormous step toward understanding the quantum
nature of light. Nevertheless, it took another three decades to develop a more
8The constant h had not yet been introduced by Planck. The actual way that Wien wrote his
distribution was ρWien (ω) = aω3e−bω/T , where a and b were parameters used to ﬁt the data.
9Planck’s constant was ﬁrst introduced as h = 6.626×10−34J·s, convenient for working with
frequency ν, expressed in Hz. It is common to write ħ ≡h/2π when working with frequency ω,
expressed in rad/s.

complete theory of quantum electrodynamics. Students can take comfort in the
fact that the very people who developed quantum mechanics were also bothered
by its confrontation with deep-seated intuition. If quantum mechanics bothers
you, you are in good company!
Planck found that he could derive his formula only if he made the following
strange assumption: A given mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not able to
carry an arbitrary amount of energy (for example, kBT as Rayleigh and Jeans used,
which varies continuously as a function of temperature). Rather, a ﬁeld mode
can only carry discrete amounts of energy separated by spacing ħω. Under this
assumption, the probability Pn that a mode of the ﬁeld is excited to the nth level
is proportional to the Boltzmann statistical weighting factor e−nħω/kBT . A review
of the Boltzmann factor is given in Appendix 13.B.
Max Planck (18581947, German)
was born in Kiel, the sixth child in his
family. His father was a law professor.
When Max was about nine years old,
his family moved to Munich where he
attended gymnasium. A mathematician,
Herman Muller took an interest in his
schooling and tutored him in mechanics
and astronomy. Planck was a gifted
musician, but he decided to pursue a
career in physics. At age 16 he enrolled
in the University of Munich. By age 22,
he had nished his doctoral dissertation
and habilitation thesis. He was initially
ignored by the academic community and
worked for a time as an unpaid lecturer.
He became an associate professor of
theoretical physics at the University of
Kiel and then a few years later took
over Kirchho's post at the University
of Berlin. After nearly twenty years of
idyllic and happy family life, a series
of tragedies hit the Planck household.
Planck's rst wife and mother of four,
died. Then his eldest son was killed
in action during World War I. Soon
after, his twin daughters each died
giving birth to their rst child. Later
Planck's remaining son from his rst
marriage was executed for participating
in a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler.
Planck won the Nobel prize in 1918 for
his introduction of energy quanta, but
he had serious reservations about the
course that quantum mechanics theory
took. (Wikipedia)

to obtain the probability of having energy nħω in a particular mode:

The expected energy in a particular mode of the ﬁeld is the sum of each possible
energy level (i.e. nħω) times the probability of its occurrance:

We used (0.66) again as well as a clever derivative trick.
Equation (13.15) provides the expected energy in any of the modes of the radi-
ation ﬁeld, as dictated by Planck’s assumption. To obtain the Planck distribution
(13.13), we replace kBT in the Rayleigh-Jeans formula (13.10) with the correct
expected energy (13.15).10
It is interesting that we are now able to derive the constant in the Stefan-
Boltzmann law (13.2) in terms of Planck’s constant ħ (see P13.3). The Stefan-
Boltzmann law is obtained by integrating the spectral density function (13.13)

Einstein’s A and B Coefﬁcients
More than a decade after Planck introduced his formula, and after Niels Bohr
had proposed that electrons occupy discrete energy states in atoms, Einstein
reexamined blackbody radiation in terms of Bohr’s new idea. If the material of a
blackbody radiator interacts with a particular mode of the ﬁeld with frequency
ω, then electrons in the material must make transitions between two energy
levels with energy separation hω. Since the radiation of a blackbody is in ther-
mal equilibrium with the material, Einstein postulated that the ﬁeld stimulates

13.4 Einstein’s A and B Coefﬁcients
323
electron transitions between energy levels. In addition, he postulated that some
transitions must occur spontaneously.
Einstein wrote down rate equations for populations of the two levels N1 and
N2 associated with the transition ħω:11
˙N1 = A21N2 −B12ρ (ω)N1 +B21ρ (ω)N2,
˙N2 = −A21N2 +B12ρ (ω)N1 −B21ρ (ω)N2
(13.18)
The coefﬁcient A21 is the rate of spontaneous emission from state 2 to state 1,
B12ρ (ω) is the rate of stimulated absorption from state 1 to state 2, and B21ρ (ω)
is the rate of stimulated emission from state 2 to state 1. He supposed that the
rate of stimulated transitions ought to be proportional to spectral density ρ (ω).
Albert Einstein (18791955, German)
is without a doubt the most famous sci-
entist in history. Time Magazine named
him Person of the Century. Born in
Ulm to a (non-practicing) Jewish fam-
ily, young Albert was inuenced by a
medical student, Max Talmud, who took
meals with his family and enthusiasti-
cally introduced the 10-year-old Albert
to geometry and other topics. Einstein's
father wanted Albert to be trained as an
electrical engineer, but Albert clashed
with his teachers in that program and
withdrew. Einstein then attended school
in Switzerland, and subsequently en-
tered a mathematics program at the
Polytechnic in Zurich. There, Einstein
met his rst wife, Mileva Maric, a fellow
math student, who he later divorced
before marrying Elsa Lowenthal. Early
on, Einstein could not nd a job as a
professor, and so he worked in the Swiss
patent oce until his "Miracle Year"
(1905), when he published four ma-
jor papers, including relativity and the
photoelectric eect (for which he later
received the Nobel prize). Thereafter,
job oers were never in short supply.
In 1933, as the Nazi regime came to
power, Einstein emigrated from Ger-
many to the US and became a professor
at Princeton University. Einstein is most
noted for special and general relativity,
for which he became a celebrity scientist
in his own lifetime. Einstein also made
huge contributions to statistical and
quantum mechanics. (Wikipedia)
In thermal equilibrium, the rate equations (13.18) are both equal to zero (i.e.,
˙N1 = ˙N2 = 0), since the relative populations of each level must remain constant.
We can then solve for the spectral density ρ (ω) at the given frequency. In this case,
either expression in (13.18) yields
ρ (ω) =
A21
N1
N2 B12 −B21
(13.19)
In thermal equilibrium, the spectral density must match the Planck spectral
density formula (13.13). In making the comparison, we should ﬁrst rewrite the
ratio N1/N2 of the populations in the two levels using the Boltzmann probability
factor (see appendix 13.B):
N1
N2
= e−E1/kBT
e−E2/kBT = e(E2−E1)/kBT = ehω/kBT
(13.20)
Then when equating (13.19) to the Planck blackbody spectral density (13.13) we
get
A21
eħω/kBT B12 −B21
=
ħω3
π2c3 £

(13.21)
From this expression we deduce that12
B12 = B21
(13.22)
and
A21 = ħω3
π2c3 B21
(13.23)
We see from (13.22) that the rate of stimulated absorption is the same as the rate
of stimulated emission. In addition, if one knows the rate of stimulated emission
between a pair of states, it follows from (13.23) that one also knows the rate of

1.8 (San Diego: Academic Press, 1994).
12We assume that energy levels 1 and 2 are non-degenerate. Some modiﬁcations must be made
in the case of degenerate levels, but the procedure is similar.

Chapter 13 Blackbody Radiation
spontaneous emission. This is remarkable because to derive A21 directly, one
needs quantum electrodynamics (the complete photon description). However,
to obtain B21, it is actually only necessary to use a semiclassical theory, where
the light is treated classically and the energy levels in the material are treated
quantum-mechanically using the Schrödinger equation.
In writing the rate equations, (13.18), Einstein predicted the possibility of
creating lasers ﬁfty years in advance of their development. These rate equations
are still valid even if the light is not in thermal equilibrium with the material.
The equations suggest that if the population in the upper state 2 can be made
artiﬁcially large, then ampliﬁcation will result via the stimulated transition. The
rate equations also show that a population inversion (more population in the
upper state than in the lower one) cannot be achieved by ‘pumping’ the material
with the same frequency of light that one hopes to amplify. This is because the
stimulated absorption rate is balanced by the stimulated emission rate. The
material-dependent parameters A21 and B12 = B21 are called the Einstein A and B
coefﬁcients.
Appendix 13.A
Thermodynamic Derivation of the Stefan-
Boltzmann Law
In this appendix, we derive the Stefan-Boltzmann law without relying on the
Planck blackbody formula.13 This derivation is included mainly for historical
interest. The derivation relies on the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics.
Consider a container whose walls are all at the same temperature and in
thermal equilibrium with the radiation ﬁeld inside. Notice that the units of energy
density uﬁeld (energy per volume) are equivalent to force per area, or in other
words pressure. It turns out that the radiation exerts a pressure of
P = uﬁeld/3
(13.24)
on the walls of the container. This can be derived from the fact that radiation of
energy ∆E imparts a momentum
∆p = ∆E
c cosθ
(13.25)
when it is absorbed with incident angle θ on a surface.14 A similar momentum is
imparted when radiation is emitted.
Derivation of (13.24)
13See P. W. Milonni, The Quantum Vacuum An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics, Sect.
1.2 (San Diego: Academic Press, 1994).
14The fact that light carries momentum was understood well before the development of the
theory of relativity and the photon description of light.

13.A Thermodynamic Derivation of the Stefan-Boltzmann Law
325
Consider a thin layer of space adjacent to a container wall with area A. If the layer
has thickness ∆z, then the volume in the layer is A∆z. Half of the radiation inside
the layer ﬂows toward the wall, where it is absorbed. The total energy in the layer
that will be absorbed is then ∆E = (A∆z)uﬁeld/2, which arrives during the interval
∆t = ∆z/(c cosθ), assuming for the moment that all light is directed with angle θ;
we must average the angle of light propagation over a hemisphere.
The pressure on the wall due to absorption (i.e. force or dp/dt per area) is then

In equilibrium, an equal amount of radiation is also emitted from the wall. This
gives an additional pressure Pemit = Pabs, which conﬁrms that the total pressure is
given by (13.24).

body radiator.
We derive the Stefan-Boltzmann law using the concept of entropy, which is
deﬁned in differential form by the quantity
dS ≡dQ
T
(13.27)
where dQ is the injection of heat (or energy) into the radiation ﬁeld in the box
and T is the temperature at which that injection takes place. We would like to
write dQ in terms of uﬁeld, V , and T . Then we may invoke the fact that S is a state
variable, which implies
∂2S
∂T ∂V =
∂2S
∂V ∂T
(13.28)
This is a mathematical statement of the fact that S is fully deﬁned if the internal
energy, temperature, and volume of a system are speciﬁed. That is, S does not
depend on past temperature and volume history; it is dictated by the present
state of the system.
To obtain dQ in the form that we need, we can use the 1st law of thermody-
namics. It states that a change in internal energy dU = d (uﬁeldV ) can take place
by the injection of heat dQ or by doing work dW = PdV as the volume increases:
dQ = dU +PdV = d (uﬁeldV )+PdV

by pressure as the volume changes.

which depends on the number of conﬁgurations nobj for a given state (deﬁned,
for example, by ﬁxed energy and volume). Now imagine that the object is placed
in contact with a very large thermal reservoir. The ‘object’ could be the electro-
magnetic radiation inside a hollow blackbody apparatus, and the reservoir could
be the walls of the apparatus, capable of holding far more energy than the light
ﬁeld can hold. The condition for thermal equilibrium between the object and the
reservoir is
∂Sobj
∂Uobj
= ∂Sres
∂Ures
≡1
T
(13.35)
where temperature has been introduced as a deﬁnition, which is consistent with
(13.27).
The total number of conﬁgurations for the combined system is N = nobjnres,
where nobj and nres are the number of conﬁgurations available within the object
and the reservoir separately. A thermodynamic principle is that all possible

13.B Boltzmann Factor
327
conﬁgurations are equally probable. In thermal equilibrium, the probability for a
given conﬁguration in the object is therefore proportional to
P ∝N
nobj
= nres = eSres/kB
(13.36)
where we have invoked (13.34).
Meanwhile, a Taylor’s series expansion of Sres yields
Sres (Ures) ∼= Sres

(13.37)
Higher order terms are not needed since we assume the reservoir to be very large
so that it is disturbed only slightly by variations in the object. Since the overall
energy of the system is ﬁxed, we may write
Ures −U eq
res = ∆Ures = −∆Uobj
(13.38)
where ∆Uobj is a small change in energy in the object. When (13.35), (13.37), and
(13.38) are introduced into (13.36), the probability for the speciﬁc conﬁguration
becomes P ∝e
1
kB Sres(U eq
res)−
∆Uob j
kBT , or simply
P ∝e−
∆Uob j
kBT
(13.39)
since the ﬁrst term in the exponent is constant. ∆Uobj represents an amount
energy added to the object to establish a conﬁguration. In the case of blackbody
radiation, a mode takes on energy ∆Uobj = nħω, where n is the number of energy
quanta in the mode. The probability that a mode carries energy nħω is therefore
proportional to e−nħω
kBT .

Exercises for 13.1 Stefan-Boltzmann Law
P13.1
The Sun has a radius of RS = 6.96×108 m. What is the total power that
it radiates, given a surface temperature of 5750 K?
P13.2
A 1 cm-radius spherical ball of polished gold hangs suspended inside
an evacuated chamber that is at room temperature 20◦C. There is no
pathway for thermal conduction to the chamber wall.
(a) If the gold is at a temperature of 100◦C, what is the initial rate of
temperature loss in ◦C/s? The emissivity for polished gold is e = 0.02.
The speciﬁc heat of gold is 129 J/kg· ◦C and its density is 19.3 g/cm3.
HINT: Q = mc∆T and Power = Q/∆t. You should consider the power
ﬂowing both ways.
(b) What is the initial rate of temperature loss if the ball is coated with
ﬂat black paint, which has emissivity e = 0.95?

P13.4
(a) Derive Wien’s displacement law
λmax = 0.00290 m·K
T
which gives the strongest wavelength present in the blackbody spectral
distribution.
HINT: See Example 13.1. You may like to know that the solution to the
transcendental equation (5−x)ex = 5 is x = 4.965.
(b) What is the strongest wavelength emitted by the Sun, which has a
surface temperature of 5750 K (see P13.1)?
(c) Also ﬁnd fmax (the peak frequency in Hz) and show that it is not the
same as c/λmax. (We naturally observe λmax when making a measure-
ment using a grating spectrometer.)
