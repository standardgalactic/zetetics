The algebras of interacting “Lie random ﬁelds” that were introduced in J. Math.
Phys.
48,
122302 (2007) are developed further. The conjecture that the vacuum vector deﬁnes a state over a
Lie random ﬁeld algebra is proved. The diﬀerence between Lie random ﬁeld algebras and quantum
ﬁeld algebras is the triviality of the ﬁeld commutator at time-like separation, the ﬁeld commutator
being trivial at space-like separation in both cases. Many properties that are usually taken to be
speciﬁc to quantum theory, such as the superposition of states, entanglement, quantum ﬂuctuations,
and the violation of Bell inequalities, are also properties of Lie random ﬁelds.

INTRODUCTION
Lie ﬁelds were suggested in the 1960s as an elementary way to construct an interacting quantum ﬁeld theory that
satisﬁes the Wightman axioms, which was soon found not to be feasible[1, 2, 3, 4]. A Lie ﬁeld was deﬁned to be an
operator-valued distribution that satisﬁes commutation relations [ˆφf, ˆφg] = ω(g, f) + ˆφξ(g,f), where the test functions
f and g and ξ(f, g) are typically taken from a Schwartz space, but for a Wightman ﬁeld that is a Lie ﬁeld, it was
proved that ξ(f, g) must be zero[4]. An interesting algebraic structure, a “Lie random ﬁeld”[5], is possible, however,
when we take the commutation relations for the ﬁeld to be trivial, [ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0, which we construct as a sum of
creation and annihilation operators, ˆφf = af ∗+ a†
f, where the algebra of creation and annihilation operators satisﬁes
the commutation relations [af, a†
g] = (f, g) + aξ(g,f) + a†
ξ(f,g), following the pattern of the commutation relations of
the Lie ﬁeld. We prove the conjecture introduced in [5, Appendix B] — that the map A 7→⟨0|A|0⟩that is deﬁned by
the vacuum vector is a state over the algebra if (f, g) is an inner product — in subsection II B.
I have pursued the mathematics of Lie random ﬁelds in the hope of two possibilities. Firstly, that from a study
of the diﬀerences, similarities, and relationships between random ﬁelds and quantum ﬁelds and their measurement
theories we might gain greater insight into quantum ﬁeld theory; and secondly, that the mathematics might be usefully
employed in those situations where physicists have successfully employed other stochastic methods. In the latter case,
Stochastic Electrodynamics (SED)[6] is interesting because it explicitly models the eﬀects of quantum ﬂuctuations,
which has been found to extend considerably the range of experiments that can be modeled successfully. There has
been little acceptance of such stochastic methods, however, because they appear ad-hoc relative to algebraic quantum
ﬁeld approaches, a failing that a Lie random ﬁeld approach to some extent addresses by itself being a ﬁeld theory
and algebraic. Lie random ﬁelds, as a particular Hilbert space formalism for constructing random ﬁelds, have almost
precisely the same properties of superposition and of entanglement as are found in quantum theory. Note also that
the violation of Bell inequalities by experiment does not rule out Lie random ﬁelds as a class of physical models[7],
and there is a particle interpretation of the Lie random ﬁeld formalism that is very closely similar to a particle
interpretation of a quantum ﬁeld theory[5, §IV].
A random ﬁeld is a general structure, an indexed set of random variables, that can be used to model classical
stochastic signals. It is always the case, indeed it’s a commonplace, that measurements in classical signal processing
that determine frequency distributions of a signal at a given time are not possible even for deterministic signals, so
that, for example, Wigner functions are frequently used as time–frequency distributions[8]. In the Lie random ﬁeld
context, ˆφf commutes with ˆφg for all test functions f and g, but, as in quantum ﬁeld theory, nonlocal observables
such as a projection operator a†
g|0⟩⟨0|ag or a†
g1a†
g2|0⟩⟨0|ag1ag2 generally do not commute,
h
a†
f|0⟩⟨0|af, a†
g|0⟩⟨0|ag
i
is
generally non-zero independently of whether f and g have space-like separated supports. Indeed, for a trivial Lie
random ﬁeld and test functions restricted to positive frequency, observables such as a†
g|0⟩⟨0|ag generate exactly the
same algebra as they do in a free quantum ﬁeld.

With the introduction of creation and annihilation operators and a vacuum state, Lie random ﬁelds introduce noise
in an essential way. The noise is Gaussian for the vacuum state of a free random ﬁeld, but in general the noise
is non-Gaussian for the vacuum states of the Lie random ﬁelds we discuss here. If the inner product is Lorentz
invariant, the noise is not that of thermal ﬂuctuations (which is not Lorentz invariant), and may reasonably be
called quantum ﬂuctuations[9] (Lorentz invariant noise is called “classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation” in
the SED literature). Random ﬁelds are intended here in a relatively empiricist way: a Lie random ﬁeld is an eﬀective
⋆-algebraic mathematics for generating mutually consistent probability densities, correlations, expected values, etc.,
that are associated with test functions on space-time.
Note, however, that this approach commits us only to a
pragmatic mathematical use of probabilities and statistics, it does not commit us to a frequentist interpretation of
probability.
In Section II, we will discuss the commutation relations
[aX, a†
Y ] = (X; Y ) + aξ(Y ;X) + a†
ξ(X;Y ),
[aX, aY ] = 0,
(1)
where a set of objects Xi are elements in a vector space X, without specializing to physical models. For physics, as
in Section III, X is prototypically taken to be a Schwartz space of functions and the inner product is Lorentz and
translation invariant, allowing us to construct models in space-time, but the commutation relations (1) could be used
with other types of inner product, potentially allowing models to be constructed of causal-probabilistic relationships
between subsystems that are not necessarily spatiotemporal. An account of how to construct suitable Lie random
ﬁelds is given in Section IV. In Section V, X will be taken to be a space of functions on the cotangent manifold of
Minkowski space.

LIE RANDOM FIELDS
We consider the commutation relations (1). At ﬁrst, we consider only the axioms for associativity and for a ⋆-
algebraic structure. Note that we adopt here an opposite convention from that in [5], in that a†
X is taken to be
complex linear, so that aX is complex anti-linear; we retain the physics convention that the inner product (X; Y ) is
complex anti-linear in X and complex linear in Y , a convention that we also use for ξ(X; Y ). We obtain an associative
⋆-algebra if (X; Y )∗= (Y ; X) and we impose the Jacobi identity,
[aX, [aY , a†
Z]] + [aY , [a†
Z, aX]] + [a†
Z, [aX, aY ]] = 0,
(2)
which requires that [aX, a†
ξ(Y ;Z)] = [aY , a†
ξ(X;Z)], so that
(X; ξ(Y ; Z)) = (Y ; ξ(X; Z)),
ξ(ξ(Y ; Z); X) = ξ(ξ(X; Z); Y ),
and
ξ(X; ξ(Y ; Z)) = ξ(Y ; ξ(X; Z)).
(3)
These
relations
allow
us
to
write
a
nested
expression
such
as
ξ(X1; ξ(X2; Y1))
unambiguously
as
ξ(X1, X2; Y1).
More generally, we deﬁne ξ(Xm; ξ(X1, ..., Xm−1; Y1, ..., Yn)) = ξ(X1, ..., Xm−1, Xm; Y1, ..., Yn) and
ξ(ξ(X1, ..., Xm−1; Y1, ..., Yn); Xm) = ξ(Y1, ..., Yn; X1, ..., Xm−1, Xm), and similarly for the inner product (...; ...).
(X1, ..., Xm; Y1, ..., Yn) and ξ(X1, ..., Xm; Y1, ..., Yn) are both symmetric separately in the anti-linear and linear ar-
guments before and after the “;”.
In eﬀect, this construction remembers which of its parameters originated as
annihilation operators and which originated as creation operators and it must preserve the commutativity/symmetry
associated with creation and annihilation operators separately. Given the inner product (X1, ..., Xm; Y1, ..., Yn) and
the linear functional ξ(X1, ..., Xm; Y1, ..., Yn), we can deﬁne ξ(; Y1, ..., Yn) and ξ(X1, ..., Xm; ) by requiring that
(U1, ..., Uj; ξ(; Y1, ..., Yn), V1, ..., Vk) = (U1, ..., Uj; Y1, ..., Yn, V1, ..., Vk)
(U1, ..., Uj; ξ(X1, ..., Xn; ), V1, ..., Vk) = (U1, ..., Uj, X1, ..., Xn; V1, ..., Vk)
(4)
for all U1, ..., Uj and V1, ..., Vk. In terms of (X1, ..., Xm; Y1, ..., Yn) and ξ(X1, ..., Xm; Y1, ..., Yn) and a set of objects
f1, ..., fm, g1, ..., gn ∈X, we can express the commutation relations (1) as
[aξ(f1,...,fj;fj+1,...,fm), a†
ξ(g1,...,gk;gk+1,...,gn)] = (fj+1, ..., fm, g1, ..., gk; f1, ..., fj, gk+1, ..., gn)
+aξ(f1,...,fj,gk+1,...,gn;fj+1,...,fm,g1,...,gk)
+a†
ξ(fj+1,...,fm,g1,...,gk;f1,...,fj,gk+1,...,gn).
(5)
The action of ξ and the inner product can be extended to the symmetrized tensor algebra over X straightforwardly
by linearity, except that the inner product is undeﬁned for the scalar component of the tensor algebra.

A.
Modeling compound systems
The use of Lie random ﬁelds extends our ability to model compound systems. In the vacuum sector, constructed
as usual as a zero eigenvector of all annihilation operators, aX|0⟩= 0, we can construct a vector a†
ξ(;X1,X2)|0⟩
as well as the familiar vector constructed by the action of two creation operators on a vacuum state, a†
X1a†
X2|0⟩.
Neither of these vectors is orthogonal to all one-object vectors a†
Y |0⟩, but for the diﬀerence, the vector |X1, X2⟩2 =

a†
X1a†
X2 −a†
ξ(;X1,X2)

|0⟩, we have ⟨Y |X1, X2⟩2 = 0, for any X1, X2, and Y , so it is these diﬀerences that should
be considered to be true two-object vectors. |X1, X2⟩2 has the somewhat strange property of being undetectable
by any one-object detector, precisely because ⟨Y |X1, X2⟩2 = 0 (of course this is just as much a property of free
ﬁelds; practical detectors must be modeled as mixtures or superpositions of ideal one- and many-object detectors).
Because a†
ξ(;X1,X2) is eﬀectively trivial in the free ﬁeld case, we can understand a†
ξ(;X1,X2)|0⟩as a representation
of the emergent properties of X1 and X2 taken together that is quite distinct from the familiar vector a†
X1a†
X2|0⟩.
Table I shows the inner products for the one- and two-object cases, from which we see the way in which the inner
product (Y1, Y2; X1, X2) (with multiplicity 2) determines the diﬀerence between the free ﬁeld and an interacting ﬁeld,
corresponding, for example, to the potential energy that determines the diﬀerence between two free particles and two
interacting particles in a Hamiltonian formalism. We can construct a similar three-object vector, which is orthogonal

3⟨Y1, Y2, Y3|X1, X2, X3⟩3 from all distinct permutations of (Y1; X1)(Y2, Y3; X2, X3) (with multiplicity 2), as well as with
the obvious emergent behavior associated with (Y1, Y2, Y3; X1, X2, X3) (with multiplicity 12), all of which modify the
free ﬁeld inner product P
σ∈S3(Y1; Xσ(1))(Y2; Xσ(2))(Y3; Xσ(3)) (with multiplicity 1). Appendix B of [5] lists this inner
product explicitly, and the following subsection allows the multiplicities to be computed eﬃciently.
B.
Positive semi-deﬁniteness of the vacuum state
We prove here the conjecture posed in [5, Appendix B], that the linear map A 7→⟨0| A |0⟩is a state over the Lie
random ﬁeld, provided that (...; ...) is positive semi-deﬁnite, that is, ⟨0| BB† |0⟩≥0 for every element of the algebra.
It is enough to prove this for B taken to be a sum of products of annihilation operators. The importance of this is
that a state allows us to construct a Hilbert space using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) construction[10, §III.2.2].
|X1⟩1, |X1, X2⟩2, and |X1, X2, X3⟩3 are the ﬁrst three of a series of orthogonal vectors, which can be recursively
deﬁned as
|X1, ..., Xn⟩n = a†
Xn|X1, ..., Xn−1⟩n−1 −

From equation (9) we immediately observe that ⟨0| aY1 · · · aYm|X1, ..., Xn⟩n = 0 for m < n, so that |X1, ..., Xn⟩n are
mutually orthogonal for distinct n, no matter what internal structure X1, ..., Xn may have (such as Xi = ξ(...; ...) ).
Applying equation (9) twice to n⟨Y1, ..., Yn|X1, ..., Xn⟩n, which we note is equal to n−1⟨Y1, ..., Yn−1|aYn|X1, ..., Xn⟩n

so that the inner product is manifestly of the form given in [5, Appendix B], and hence that it is positive semi-deﬁnite.
This is enough to prove that A 7→⟨0| A |0⟩is a state over the Lie random ﬁeld, provided that (...; ...) is positive semi-
deﬁnite. For the multiplicity of the terms that are generated by the inner product, we note from equation (13) that
(Y1, ..., Yn; X1, ..., Xn) is generated Kn = n(n −1)Kn−1 = n!(n −1)! times in the product n⟨Y1, ..., Yn|X1, ..., Xn⟩n,

III.
EXPLICIT CONSTRUCTION OF A CLASS OF LIE RANDOM FIELDS
To use observables ˆφX = aX∗+a†
X to generate consistent classical multivariate probability densities, we require that
[ˆφX, ˆφY ] = 0, which requires that (X∗; Y ) = (Y ∗, X) and ξ(X∗; Y ) = ξ(Y ∗; X), for all X, Y ∈X. For a construction
in space-time, we can take X to be a Schwartz space of scalar test functions on Minkowski space that are smooth
and approach zero faster than any polynomial at large distances, and f 7→f ∗to be real-space complex conjugation
at a point, f(x) 7→f ∗(x) (so that in Fourier space, ˜f(u) 7→f
f ∗(u) = ˜f ∗(−u)). For a translation invariant scalar Lie
random ﬁeld, we found in [5, §III] that
(f; g) =
Z
δ4(u −v)
˜G∗(u) ˜f ∗(u) ˜G(v)˜g(v)d4ud4v,
˜G(s)˜ξ(f; g)(s) = λ
Z
δ4(s + u −v) ˜G∗(u) ˜f ∗(u) ˜G(v)˜g(v)d4ud4v,
(14)
satisﬁes all the constraints, where ˜G(v) = ˜G∗(−v) is a Lorentz invariant function of the wave-number that models
the causal structure of space-time (it was unstated in [5] that λ must be real).
The condition ˜G(v) = ˜G∗(−v)
is incompatible with the positive semi-deﬁnite Hamiltonian spectrum condition that is required by the Wightman
axioms, for which in this context ˜G(v) must be non-zero only for v forward-pointing and either light-like or time-like
(see Appendix A for a discussion).
Constructions of a Lie random ﬁeld based on a vector ﬁeld or based on the
electromagnetic ﬁeld are possible, using a symmetrized pair-wise contraction of all tensor indices[5, §V].
We will reconsider equation (14) for a moment. Recalling that f
h∗(u) = ˜h∗(−u), [ˆφh1, ˆφh2] is zero for all h1 and h2
if
Z
˜G∗(w) ˜G(w + s)(eix·(2w+s) −e−ix·(2w+s))d4w
(15)
is zero for all s and for all x (in a moment we will reconsider microcausality brieﬂy, for which we require that the
Equation (15) is zero for all s and for all space-like x, but in general is non-zero for time-like x). In eﬀect, we have
here set h1(r) = δ4(r −x) and h2(r) = δ4(r + x); if the commutator is zero for all such choices, it will be zero for all
test functions. Substituting z = 2w + s, we require that
Z
˜G∗
z −s
2

˜G
z + s
2

(eix·z −e−ix·z)d4z
(16)
is zero for all s and for all x. This is satisﬁed for time-like as well as for space-like x if ˜G∗( z−s
2 ) ˜G( z+s
2 ) is invariant
under z 7→−z, yielding a Lie random ﬁeld, which is easily seen to be possible.
In a slight amendment to the derivation in [5], this nonlinear requirement is satisﬁed for functions ˜G(v) for which
˜G(v) = c ˜G∗(−v), |c|2 = 1, not just for ˜G(v) = ˜G∗(−v). The value chosen for c eﬀectively modiﬁes interference
between positive and negative frequency modes. This has a signiﬁcant eﬀect for local observables; for example, for
the fourth moment of the probability density associated with an observable ˆφf, for which ˆφ†
f = ˆφf ∗= ˆφf, f ∗= f, we
have
⟨0|ˆφ4
f|0⟩= (f; f, f, f) + 4(f, f; f, f) + (f, f, f; f) + 3(f; f)2
= (4 + c + c∗)(f, f; f, f) + 3(f; f)2,
(17)
so we can adjust the kurtosis of this probability density by a factor of 3 by adjusting the complex phase of c
(parenthetically, the kurtosis cannot in any case be negative, which is a notable limitation). The value chosen for c
makes no diﬀerence, however, for nonlocal observables such as a†
g|0⟩⟨0|ag (which are commonly used in quantum ﬁeld
theory), where ˜g(v) is non-zero only for v forward-pointing and either light-like or time-like.
Microcausality requires Equation (16) to be zero only for space-like x, which requires invariance of ˜G∗( z−s
2 ) ˜G( z+s
2 )
under all space-like reﬂections z 7→z′ = z −2 z·x
x·xx, x · x < 0, without invariance under z 7→−z. Reﬂections preserve
the inner product, z′ · z′ = z · z, and forward and backward light-cones and mass-shells are separately invariant under
space-like reﬂections so this is equivalent to invariance of ˜G∗( z−s
2 ) ˜G( z+s
2 ) under maps of z to any other point on the
same connected part of its mass-shell, for all z and s. Baumann[4] proves that this construction is not possible for
Wightman ﬁelds, for which s and z ± s are restricted to the forward light-cone, except trivially, ˜G(v) = 0, but it is
clear from the geometry alone, without the tools of analysis, that nontrivial microcausality is also not possible for a
creation and annihilation operator ansatz for Lie ﬁelds even if we do not constrain the spectrum of the Hamiltonian.

IV.
CONSTRUCTING LIE RANDOM FIELDS
It is necessary to build mathematics and intuition that will allow us to match empirical data with Lie random ﬁeld
models as painlessly as possible.
For a free ﬁeld, the fundamental mathematical object is the kernel of the map X 7→(X; X). This map is zero
everywhere except on the mass shell, and correspondingly there are ﬂuctuations associated only with the mass shell.
If we attempt to measure ˆφf using a test function that has no on-mass-shell component, we obtain a probability
distribution with zero mean and zero standard deviation, because the inner product projects all test functions to
the mass shell. We can say, loosely, that only on-mass-shell components of test functions that are used to model
measurement apparatuses “resonate” with states in the Hilbert space that are used to model preparation apparatuses.
For the free electromagnetic ﬁeld, we can construct a quantum or random ﬁeld[5, §V][11, equation (3.27)], omitting
the restriction to positive frequency in the random ﬁeld case,

Repeating the brief discussion of [5, §V], “note that E and F are not electromagnetic ﬁeld tensors, they are bivectors
of classical test functions that contribute to a description of measurement and/or state preparation of the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld. If the fourier transform ˜Fµν(u) of a test function F has electric and magnetic ﬁeld components
(˜e1, ˜e2, ˜e3) and (˜b1,˜b2,˜b3), the integrand for the inner product (F; F)EMq at (u0, 0, 0, u0) is the positive semi-deﬁnite
form u2
0
h
(˜e1 + ˜b2)2 + (˜e2 −˜b1)2i
, which suppresses all except two degrees of freedom of the quantum electromagnetic
ﬁeld at each wave number.” Because we have not included a term ∗˜E∗
µβ(u)uµuν∗˜F β
ν (u), where ∗Fµν = ε
αβ
µν
Fαβ is the
Hodge dual of the test function Fαβ, we have in eﬀect ensured that the electromagnetic ﬁeld itself satisﬁes the Maxwell
equation ǫαλµν∂λFµν = 0 in all states (in this last equation only, Fµν is what we might call the electromagnetic ﬁeld
itself, which we can use here because there are no ﬂuctuations whatsoever in the relevant degrees of freedom, for all
states that can be constructed by the application of creation operators to the vacuum state, but care is required).
The Lie random ﬁeld models of Section III are completely determined by ˜G(u), with the kernel of f 7→f,ג
ff(גu) = ˜G(u) ˜f(u), determining the kernel of X 7→(X; X). Linear constraints on observables and conserved currents
make their appearance in this model as straightforward projective properties of ˜G(u). For nonlinear constraints and
conserved currents, however, I am at present unable to oﬀer a well-formulated conjecture relating constraints and
conserved currents to detailed properties of f 7→f.ג
Although it appears that Lie random ﬁelds can be extended to include Fermionic algebraic elements, the standard
anti-commutation relations for spin- 1
2 ﬁelds are not gauge-invariant, and I have not been able to construct any that are.
It appears, therefore — assuming that we take gauge invariance to have similar signiﬁcance in the theoretical setting
of Lie random ﬁelds to its signiﬁcance in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches — that we may have to work with
conserved observable currents and other constraints between observable ﬁelds, as is commonly advocated in formal
approaches to quantum ﬁeld theory[12]. There are many alternatives to consider, however, and the constraints need
to be articulated in terms appropriate to Lie random ﬁeld models in a way that might reproduce the phenomenology
of quantum electrodynamics, the electroweak model, or the standard model of particle physics.
Even if a Lie random ﬁeld approach to fundamental physics ultimately fails, I have found that understanding this
kind of model relative to quantum ﬁeld theory has greatly illuminated the latter, and Lie random ﬁelds may be of
use as practical models wherever classical stochastic methods have already been useful or would be useful if quantum
ﬂuctuations were explicitly modeled.

LIE RANDOM FIELDS ON COTANGENT MANIFOLDS
A natural extension of the scalar Lie random ﬁeld on Minkowski space M is a scalar Lie random ﬁeld on the
cotangent manifold T ∗M, for which we take the test functions to be maps f : T ∗M →C; (x, p) 7→f(x, p). For some
simple choices of detailed structure, this construction admits a classical relativistic gas interpretation, but a wide
range of detailed Lorentz invariant structures is possible for a Lie random ﬁeld on the cotangent manifold. We will
construct Lie random ﬁelds on the cotangent manifold for which we can take f(x, p) to be relatively unrestricted as
a function of p at a point x, while it is most convenient to require that f(x, p) should satisfy the Schwartz space
requirements of smoothness and faster than polynomial decrease as a function of x.

7
We will write ˜f(u, p) for the Fourier transform of f(x, p) only in the x variable, and we will introduce a function
f(גx, p) for scalar test functions on the cotangent manifold, f
f(גu, p) = ˜G(u, p) ˜f(u, p), for which
(f; g) =
Z
f
f∗ג
(u, p) eg(גu, p)d4ud4p,
(20)
eξ(גf; g)(s, p) = λ
Z
δ4(s + u −v)f
f∗ג
(u, p) eg(גv, p)d4ud4v.
(21)
This constructs a Lie random ﬁeld on the cotangent manifold if ˜G∗( z−s
2 , p) ˜G( z+s
2 , p) is invariant under z 7→−z for
all p and s. An instructive elementary example that satisﬁes this requirement is
˜G(u, p) = θ(u2 −m2)θ(p2)θ(p0) exp
 
−(2 (u·p)2
u·u
−p · p)
2m2
!
,
(22)
which requires that p must be small, in a Riemannian metric sense relative to the time-like direction of u, for there
to be a large contribution to inner products of test functions. The particular choice of ˜G(u, p) given here ensures that
there is a nonzero probability only if p is a forward-pointing 4-momentum vector, which allows us to interpret this
choice as somewhat like a classical relativistic gas.
Moments of the probability density for ˆφf for this choice of ˜G(u, p) are ﬁnite even for a test function such as F(u)Vµpµ
for any 4-vector Vµ and Schwartz space function F(u) because of the “coupling” between u and p. Generally, we can
use a test function F(u)T (u, p) for any multinomial T (u, p) in the 4-vectors uµ and pµ, including the most immediate
examples of a scalar test function F(u) and a set of test functions indexed by a bivector, F(u)B[µν]u[µpν]. This
type of model allows us to model measurements associated with a whole class of tensor-valued Lie random ﬁelds
on Minkowski space as measurements of a single scalar Lie random ﬁeld on the cotangent manifold, which would
represent a signiﬁcant uniﬁcation if there are any physical systems for which it is possible.
We can also introduce a less convergent map f 7→f,גfor which, for example,
˜G(u, p) =
θ(u2 −m2)θ(p2)θ(p0)
(m4 + 2(u · p)2 −(u · u)(p · p))r/2 ,
(23)
which allows us to use a test function F(u)T (u, p) for any multinomial T (u, p) in the 4-vectors uµ and pµ provided
the degree of T (u, p) in p is less than r −2. For multinomials that exceed this degree, this ansatz does not give a
test function that results in well-deﬁned measurements, so we can consider this map f 7→fגto allow us to model a
scalar ﬁeld, a vector ﬁeld, and tensor ﬁelds that have degree less than r −2 in p, but there are also other ﬂuctuations
present that do not allow test functions to be constructed using a tensor multinomial ansatz. In general, the map
f 7→fגdeﬁnes what test functions give well-deﬁned measurements, but, except for the speciﬁcation of the kernel,
there is an element of conventionality to our choice of f 7→f.גMuch more complicated functions ˜G(u, p) are of
course possible, which presumably should be classiﬁed by symmetries of their kernels. A more general ansatz uses an
arbitrary commutative and associative product for the cotangent manifold coordinate (the most elementary example
of which would be convolution instead of the straightforward multiplication used in Equations (20) and (21) ), which
can be implemented in terms of an integral transform f
f(גu, p) =
R ˜G(u, p, q) ˜f(u, q)d4q, with Equations (20) and (21)
otherwise unchanged. This constructs a Lie random ﬁeld on the cotangent manifold if ˜G∗( z−s
2 , p, q) ˜G( z+s
2 , p, q′) is
invariant under z 7→−z for all p, q, q′, and s.

DISCUSSION
We have proved the conjecture posed in [5] that the vacuum vector allows us to construct a state over a Lie random
ﬁeld, and hence we can construct a Hilbert space using the GNS construction. We have also revisited the construction
of Lie random ﬁelds on Minkowski space and introduced a construction of Lie random ﬁelds on the cotangent space
of Minkowski space, which it is hoped may allow a novel form of uniﬁcation of tensor-valued Lie random ﬁelds on
Minkowski space.
The constraints of microcausality and of positive semi-deﬁniteness of the Hamiltonian are so stringent that after
over 50 years only free quantum ﬁelds are known for the Minkowski space case, suggesting that one or both constraints
might proﬁtably be weakened or removed. The microcausality constraint is empirically quite well supported because
of its close and much discussed relationship to the impossibility of sending messages faster than light. In contrast,
that the Hamiltonian must be positive semi-deﬁnite is a mathematically forceful constraint that is barely discussed
in the literature, and we can straightforwardly construct a large class of what otherwise appear to be interesting Lie
random ﬁelds if we relax it.

It has also been understood that the violation of Bell inequalities prevents all classical models, however random
ﬁeld models are capable of modeling the violation of Bell inequalities in exact parallel with quantum ﬁeld models.
Measurement can be modeled by nonlocal projection operators such as a†
g|0⟩⟨0|ag, exactly as is commonly the practice
in quantum optics, and adopting a pragmatic restriction to positive frequencies, instead of modeling measurement by
local operators such as ˆφf. Such nonlocal projection operators, using only positive frequency test functions satisfy
exactly the same noncommutative algebraic structure in a free random ﬁeld model as they satisfy in a free quantum
ﬁeld model, eﬀectively as a mathematics appropriate for classical signal processing. In the free random ﬁeld case, the
restriction to positive frequency is implemented by the modeler using only positive frequency test functions, which
we know from quantum ﬁeld theory is empirically adequate, instead of the restriction being enforced algebraically. In
a more general theoretical setting, it is in principle possible to model the violation of Bell inequalities using random
ﬁelds by virtue of the analysis in [7]. Note that the measurement theory associated with classical random ﬁelds is
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the measurement theory associated with quantum ﬁelds[5, Appendix A].
It should be emphasized that we have not entirely avoided renormalization, but we have reformulated the way in
which characteristic length scales of an experimental apparatus are expressed in the mathematics. Test functions
used in a model of the state preparation and measurement parts of an experimental apparatus deﬁne numerous length
scales that are signiﬁcant to the operation of the experiment. Signiﬁcantly, a test function characterization of the
length scales that are most important for understanding an experiment is better deﬁned and more detailed than the
single renormalization mass scale that is introduced, in a relatively ad-hoc way, when using renormalization group
methods to characterize the entire operation of an experimental apparatus. I cannot yet identify what properties of
the Lie random ﬁeld structure correspond to renormalizable ﬁelds, but renormalizable ﬁelds are generally understood
to be invariant whatever sequences of functions we use when we approach a delta function limit. It seems possible
that such a criterion may characterize a tightly limited class of renormalizable Lie random ﬁelds, however Lie random
ﬁelds are relatively indiﬀerent to such a criterion, and the principle that we should only use renormalizable theories
for fundamental physics is generally no longer considered absolute.
There are two other technical issues that deserve mention. We have not introduced a norm on the Lie random
ﬁeld algebras because the operators are unbounded, following the practice of Wightman ﬁelds and of most particle
physics. We have not, in other words, engaged with the Haag-Kastler axiomatic approach, which posits the existence
of C∗-algebras of bounded observables that satisfy the Haag-Kastler axioms. Secondly, the formalism described here
is manifestly Lorentz and translation covariant, but we have not engaged with the axiomatic insistence that there
must be a continuous action of the Poincar´e group on the Hilbert spaces we construct. This paper, in contrast,
would allow us to take a few test functions, freely generate a Hilbert space using only those functions, then consider
what measurements and state preparations can be modeled in this limited regime. Given a manifestly Lorentz and
translation invariant formalism, we can construct an inﬁnite set of test functions, leading to a representation of the
Poincar´e group, and many of the resources of mathematical analysis in consequence, but practical engineering often
does not require the mathematics of inﬁnite, complete sets of test functions.
I am grateful to Marco Frasca for comments that redirected my thinking on positive semi-deﬁniteness of the
Hamiltonian and to Ken Wharton for comments on a draft of the paper.
APPENDIX A: POSITIVE SEMI-DEFINITENESS OF THE HAMILTONIAN: A DISCUSSION
The concreteness of a Lie ﬁeld approach results in a concentrated focus on positive semi-deﬁniteness of the Hamil-
tonian as constantly preventing the construction of what otherwise appear to be interesting mathematical objects.
We assume here that we wish to preserve the associativity of the algebra of creation and annihilation operators,
the commutativity of creation operators and annihilation operators separately, [aX, aY ] = 0 and [a†
X, a†
Y ] = 0, and a
⋆-algebraic structure. These are already fairly tight constraints, to which we would like to add at least two further
axioms, microcausality and positive semi-deﬁniteness of the Hamiltonian on the vacuum sector.
It is apparent,
however, that all these axioms together more-or-less over-constrain the algebraic structure, in that, except for speciﬁc
interacting quantum ﬁeld models in low dimension, the only known quantum ﬁelds are the free quantum ﬁelds[12].
Of the two additional axioms, microcausality seems more secure because of its relatively direct empirical relationship
to the impossibility of sending messages faster than light (although this does not dictate that the ﬁeld commutation
relations must be nontrivial at time-like separation).
Positive semi-deﬁniteness of the Hamiltonian, in contrast,
although it is a centerpiece of both the Wightman axioms and the Haag-Kastler axioms, is generally given only a
weak theoretical justiﬁcation that it ensures “stability” of the vacuum: if there were lower energy states than the
vacuum, surely the vacuum would decay into them. Against this reading of why we need positive semi-deﬁniteness
of the Hamiltonian in the vacuum sector, thermal sector representations have an energy spectrum that is unbounded
below, but we take the maximally symmetric thermal state to be more thermodynamically stable than other states
in a given thermal sector. Positive semi-deﬁniteness of the Hamiltonian is also central to algebraic approaches to
quantum ﬁeld theory because it ensures various analyticity properties that are relied on heavily in proofs of various

9
theorems, however there are interesting theorems that can be proved in thermal sectors of a quantum ﬁeld theory.
A Lie random ﬁeld is essentially a classical ﬁeld-theoretic model, but a relatively sophisticated formalism is required
to model Lorentz invariant vacuum states and thermal equilibrium states carefully. Classical states that have nontrivial
ﬂuctuations have classical energy inﬁnitely greater than states that have no ﬂuctuations, but may nonetheless be
thermodynamically stable if they are translation invariant. Positive semi-deﬁniteness of the Hamiltonian looks rather
diﬀerent in the classical context of a Lie random ﬁeld than it looks for a quantum ﬁeld, despite extensive algebraic
and geometrical similarities. Both positive and negative frequencies are essential to ensure that the classical trivial
commutation relation [ˆφf, ˆφg] = 0 is satisﬁed for Lie random ﬁelds; the positive or negative frequency of a mode of a
Lie random ﬁeld is not directly related to the inﬁnitely positive classical energy of a mode of a ﬁeld that translation
invariantly ﬁlls all of Minkowski space.
Finally, Lie random ﬁelds are constructed as a block-world formalism. There is no question of “stability” in the
conventional sense; adding a positive or a negative frequency component to a given state just changes the results of
measurement in diﬀerent ways. There is a block-world sense in which there is no evolution of a state, even though
a unitary operator that models active time translations can be constructed[5, §IV], because a state ﬁxes what the
results of measurements would be for all time. Energy arguments are less signiﬁcant in a Lie random ﬁeld formalism
insofar as the Lie random ﬁeld formalism is treated more as a block-world model than is conventional perturbative
quantum ﬁeld theory. Note that this is not an ontological claim that the world is a 4-dimensional block-world, only
a description of the mathematical components of this kind of model.
