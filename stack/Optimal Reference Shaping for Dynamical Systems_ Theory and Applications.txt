Preface
The area of feedback control is rich with analysis and synthesis tools that cater to
continuous and discrete time systems, linear and nonlinear systems, and stochastic
and deterministic systems. Feedback control has created technology that has landed
men on the moon; created commodity products, such as CD players, where the op-
tical pickup needs to be centered on the data track with an accuracy of a few μ
meters; cruise control for cars, and so forth; and in exotic applications such as tele-
manipulation in medical surgery. It is hard to identify an engineering discipline that
has not been impacted by feedback control. Research into feedback control continues
with engineers, economists, biologists, and others studying parochial problems.
Feedforward control refers to techniques that modify or shape the reference input
to the system in anticipation of the expected response of the system. If the system
being controlled is well understood, the expected output will be close to the actual
output. In such scenarios, feedforward control can be selected to meet a desired
objective such as rest-to-rest maneuvering or reject periodic disturbances that can
be measured. In this book, the terms feedforward control, input shaping, and pre-
ﬁltering will be used to refer to the mechanism of selecting an open-loop control
proﬁle to satisfy a desired objective. The systems being studied will be limited to
those that are stable or marginally stable. Three examples in the following para-
graphs are used to illustrate that the beneﬁt of using feedforward control includes the
ability of achieving performance that is unable to be matched by feedback control.
Biomimetics is a term used to label research that endeavors to emulate nature. For
example, artiﬁcial neural networks are an attempt to emulate how the networks of
biological neurons learn, process, and control. Other examples include understand-
ing how bats navigate to permit design of autonomous robots for rescue operations
in post-earthquake disasters. A recent study to understand the cause of stuttering
has led to a conjecture that the process of communicating using sounds includes two
modalities, a feedforward command based on a learned model and a feedback mode
where the auditory output is compared to the commanded signal and the error is used
for correcting speech.
  Numerical simulation has revealed that the weakening of the
feedforward component of the process mandates an increased reliance on the feed-
back component, which results in stuttering due to the delays in the feedback loop.
The low incidence of stuttering among the deaf is a supporting empirical piece of
evidence.

ings of the 7th Oxford Dysﬂuency Conference, St. Catherine’s College, Oxford University, June 29–July

How does the human brain synthesize a motor control proﬁle to move a baseball
bat to make contact with a ball moving at 100 miles/hour? Tracking the motion of
the ball requires oculomotor control, which includes efferent delays in command-
ing the motion of the eyes resulting in about 130 milliseconds (ms) of delay in the
feedback loop. The visuo-motor loop for moving the baseball bat includes delays to
the order of 200 to 250 ms.† A baseball traveling at 100 miles/hour takes 412 ms
to reach home plate from the pitching rubber, a distance of 60.5 feet. By the time
the ball is released by the pitcher and the batter moves the bat, the ball has passed
the halfway point, not giving the batter an opportunity to correct for the curve ball.
Solely employing a feedback controller will not achieve the desired performance of
striking the baseball. Scientists have hypothesized that this complex motion control
is possible because of the coexistence of a feedback and feedforward mode in a mo-
tor control system. The feedforward component of the control relies on a learned
inverse model, while the feedback mode uses a forward model as an estimator to
generate estimated states that are compared to reference states and the error is used
in the feedback control mode. Abnormal behavior of either of these components can
result in inefﬁcient movement execution. Morasso and Sanguineti‡ conclude that er-
rors in the feedforward component of the control are responsible for inaccuracies in
movement execution.
Cells, when exposed to stress can lead to denaturation of proteins. Denaturation
refers to the process where proteins lose their three-dimensional (3D) structure which
can cause disruptions in the functioning of the cell and in the worst case can cause
the death of the cell.§ The cell can produce defense proteins which restore the de-
natured protein. These defense proteins are produced in a feedforward manner to
rapidly respond to the applied stress. However, uncertainties in the estimate of the
stress can lead to an over- or underproduction of the defense protein. Feedback is
the mechanism used by the cell to produce the defense proteins in response to the
measured damage. Its drawback is the delay in responding to the imposed stress.
Clearly, in addition to feedback mechanisms, nature exploits feedforward control,
which is based on knowledge of the system model.
A Google search of the phrase “feedback control” results in nearly 118 million
hits. A search on the phrase “feedforward control” results in about 300,000 hits.
This na¨ıve evidence is quite revealing of the disparity in the investment for develop-
ing feedforward control compared to feedback control. There are some engineering
applications where feedforward control has been used to successfully deal with chal-
lenging problems. For instance, in CD and DVD players the center of the spindle
motor is seldom coincident with the center of the data spiral on the storage medium.
This causes a radial tracking error which is periodic with a frequency which is coin-

cident with the spindle speed. The optical pickup must track the center of the spiral
within a few μ meters precision to reliably read the data. Feedforward controllers
are used to compensate for the periodic disturbance by identifying the amplitude and
phase of the periodic radial disturbance, and have been successfully demonstrated on
optical storage devices.
This book is a modest attempt to ﬁll the gap in the area of shaping the reference
input to dynamical systems whose responses are characterized by lightly damped
modes. This is essentially an open-loop control strategy and requires the system be-
ing controlled to be stable or marginally stable. However, one should note that the
plant being controlled can include a feedback component and the design would con-
sider the closed-loop dynamics of the plant as the system of interest. This book does
not exclusively consider open-loop control. It presents robust feedback controller
design as an extension of an approach that can be exploited for robust open-loop
controller design. The goal of this book is to provide in a tutorial manner various al-
gorithms for attenuating the residual oscillations that are excited by reference inputs
to dynamical systems. Some sections of this book are suitable as complementary
material to undergraduate courses focusing on feedback control. This book would
be suitable for an introductory graduate course in mechanical, aerospace, electrical,
civil, and chemical engineering, despite the use of examples which look suitable for
the mechanical and aerospace communities only. This is because oscillatory behav-
ior exists, among others, in electrical, chemical, or civil engineering applications.
Outline of the Book
This book is organized as follows: Chapter 1 develops models for applications
whose dynamics are dominated by lightly damped poles. Since most of the illus-
trative examples in the rest of the book are benchmark problems, the objective of
the development of dynamic models in Chapter 1 is to provide the reader with a
suite of real-world problems which can be used as exercises. Chapter 2 is devoted
to the development of time-delay ﬁlters (Input Shapers
TM), which are used to shape
the reference input to dynamical systems undergoing rest-to-rest maneuvers, so as
to eliminate or minimize the residual energy which would correspond to accurate
positioning of the ﬁnal states. The time-delay ﬁlter design technique is illustrated
on single- and multi-mode systems and for continuous and discrete-time systems.
Chapter 3 reviews basic concepts in calculus of variations and can be skipped by the
reader who is familiar with this material. Chapter 4 focuses exclusively on four con-
trol problems, all of which include saturation constraints for the control input. The
four problems are: (1) Time-optimal control, (2) Fuel/time-optimal control, (3) Fuel
limited time-optimal control, and (4) Jerk limited time-optimal control. A system-
atic increase in the level of difﬁculty starting from a rigid body system and leading
to a damped ﬂoating oscillator benchmark problem is used to illustrate the change in

the structure of the optimal control proﬁle. Chapters 2 and 4 present a technique for
desensitizing the open-loop proﬁle or shaped proﬁle to uncertainties in model param-
eters. The robustness is achieved by forcing the state sensitivities evaluated about the
nominal model parameters to zero. Chapter 5 poses the problem of design of a ro-
bust time-delay ﬁlter as a minimax optimization problem. This technique can exploit
knowledge of the distribution of the uncertain parameters. Friction is a constant pres-
ence in many mechanical and aerospace applications and is detrimental for precision
position control. Chapter 6 focuses on the development of input constrained design
of open-loop control proﬁles which accounts for friction in the design of point-to-
point control proﬁles. Rigid body and systems with lightly damped modes are used
to illustrate the control techniques. The ﬁnal chapter of this book deals with numer-
ical techniques for solving the problem of design of shaped inputs. Gradient-based
and convex programming-based approaches are presented and illustrated on simple
examples. MATLAB R

Introduction
Imagination is more important than knowledge.
Albert Einstein,1921 Nobel Laureate in Physics
T
HE primary goal of this book is to present techniques to control self-induced
vibrations (oscillations) in linear or quasi-linear dynamical systems. This im-
plies that oscillatory behavior, which is a manifestation of underdamped modes of
the system, are excited by the reference input to the system. For example, the os-
cillatory motion of a portainer (container crane) payload, when the hoist carrying
trolley is used to maneuver containers, is an illustration of the self-excited vibra-
tions. This is in contrast to vibrations of systems excited by exogenous inputs, for
example, wind excited vibrations that led to the destruction of the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge. Precise positioning of the containers in an expeditious manner is mandatory
for efﬁcient operation of ports. Since the mass of the containers which have to be
loaded and discharged are not uniform, control techniques which are insensitive to
variations in container mass are desirous. Techniques which endeavor to desensitize
the controller to variations (uncertainties) in system model will be presented and the
robustness versus performance trade-off will be discussed. In this book, the term
vibration will be loosely used to represent any kind of oscillatory motion.
A large number of applications are characterized by self-excited vibrations. These
include hard disk drives, high-speed tape drives, high-speed elevators for skyscrap-
ers, containers crane, slosh dynamics of ﬂuids in containers, vehicle platoons in in-
telligent transportation, wafer scanners for manufacturing integrated circuits using
photolithography etc. A growing number of applications have exploited techniques
presented in this book or variations of ones presented, with beneﬁcial results. In this
chapter, some of the aforementioned applications will be presented in some detail to
provide examples which the reader can use to test techniques which will be presented
in this book.

Hard Disk Drives
IBM has consistently pioneered breakthrough technology in magnetic storage de-
vices. Following experimenting with rotating cylindrical drums, the ﬁrst disk drives

whose operating concepts are similar to the ones in use today were conceived of in
the 1950s. The ﬁrst production hard disk drive (IBM 305 RAMAC) was introduced
in September 1956, by IBM which stored 5 megabytes on 50 disks of 24 inch diame-
ters. This corresponded to an areal density of 2000 bits/square inch. Areal density is
deﬁned as the product of TPI (tracks per inch) and BPI (bits per inch), i.e., the num-
ber of bits per inch of a track. Prior to the IBM 305 RAMAC, the read/write head of
the hard disk drives were in contact with the surface of this disk to compensate for
the low sensitivity of the electronics of that vintage. This resulted in the read/write
head and the magnetic coating of the disks, wearing out. The IBM 305 RAMAC
was the ﬁrst disk drive which created an air cushion on which the read/write head
ﬂoated. This was achieved by supplying pressurized air to create an air bearing be-
tween the head and the magnetic media [1]. From that breakthrough technology, the
design of heads has progressed to a point where a self-generated air bearing is used
to separate the head from the storage medium with a gap distance which is equal to
mean free path, which is the average distance between collisions of air molecules,
with the relative velocity between the head and the magnetic media greater than 40
meters/sec. The air bearing generated by the relative motion of the disk and the head,
in conjunction with the suspension permits the head to adapt to imperfections on the
disk surface by maintaining a fairly constant ﬂying height.
Over the same period, the read head technology has changed from the inductive
read/write heads which were ﬁrst used to sense the magnetization changes to the
current thin ﬁlm inductive write GMR (giant magneto resistive) read heads. IBM
introduced the 0663-E12 drive in 1991, which had a form factor of 3.5 inches that
illustrated the use of MR (magneto resistive) read heads to greatly increase the areal
density. The MR head consists of magnetic material whose resistance changes as
a function of the incident magnetic ﬁeld. This was followed by the introduction of
the GMR read head technology, by IBM in December 1997. The industry’s ﬁrst
GMR (Peter Gr¨unberg and Albert Fert who discovered GMR won the Nobel Prize in
Physics in 2007) based storage device [2] had an areal density of 2.69 Gbits/in2.
The exponential growth of areal density has permitted the development of drives
with smaller form factors, which has also permitted increasing the spindle speed. The
increased spindle speeds (15,000 rpm, Savvio 15K Seagate Drive [3]) have resulted
in reduced latency and the increased areal density has resulted in the requirement of
high performance seeking and following controllers. Latency is deﬁned as the time
required to position the proper sector under the read/write head and is therefore,
wasted time.
As areal density increases, the precision requirement of the seek and follow con-
trollers increases. Reduction of seek times is another driving factor in the devel-
opment of next generations of hard disk drives. This has to occur in conjunction
with the reduction in size of the hard disk drive. Reduction in seek time for a given
voice coil motor corresponds to reducing the inertia of the actuator. However, this
is associated with a reduction in the natural frequencies of vibrations resulting in
the vibratory modes contributing to an increase in the seek time because of residual
vibration of the head. Thus, there exists a motivation to develop control algorithms
to minimize the seek time with a constraint of eliminating residual vibrations.

Figure 1.1 illustrates a head disk assembly (HDA) which consists of the voice coil
actuator, arm, and the slider. The arm carrying the read/write head is excited by
rapid maneuvering by the voice coil motor. Traditionally, transfer function for the
arm includes a rigid body mode and multiple underdamped ﬂexible modes, which
are used to design controllers. The rigid body model can be represented as [5]:

High-Speed Tape Drives
Since its introduction in 1972 by IBM and 3M, magnetic tape storage has been a
cost effective means of storing and retrieving data. It continues to be used due to its
10 to 1 cost advantage over disk drives [6]. The current roadmap for tape storage
targets a capacity of 16 Terabytes in a cartridge by 2015 [7]. This has prompted
research into utilization of thinner media, increasing the read/write velocity from
the current 4 m/s to 12–15 m/s and increasing the track density [3]. The paramount
problem which needs to be addressed is precise high velocity and low tension control
of the tape media.
Panda and Lu [8] present a tutorial on controller for tape drives. They present a
simple multi-input multi-output model to represent the dynamics of the tape tension
and velocity as a function of the torques used to drive the supply and take-up reels.
Mathur and Messner [9] describe the effect of air entrainment between layers of tape
on the system dynamics for high-speed low-tension tape drives. The model they
proposed is presented here.
Figure 1.2 illustrates schematically a high-speed tape drive.

High-Speed Elevator
With the rapid growth of increasingly taller skyscrapers, there has been a progres-
sive increase in the speed of the elevator. The 1930 Empire State Building elevators
are rated at a speed of 300 meters/min (mpm). Since then, rated speed of elevators
have grown nearly linearly with time culminating with the 1010 mpm speed of the
high-speed elevators in the Taipei 101 in 2004 [11]. With the increasing speed of the
elevators have come numerous other issues which require active control. These in-
clude atmospheric pressure control to regulate the rate of change of cabin pressure to
be the same which has been shown to be physiologically comfortable. Aerodynamic

Cranes
Coulton [14] dates the use of cranes to the 6th century BC by the Greeks. From the
6th century BC to the present day cranes which include gantry cranes, tower cranes,
lufﬁng tower cranes, and boom cranes, have used mechanical advantage generated
by pulleys, hydraulic drives, and so forth, to hoist large loads. The lightly damped
nature of the cable/payload system results in signiﬁcant pendulation of the payload.
This lightly damped oscillatory motion of the payload can be excited by the control
system in the process of reorienting the payload. This motion could also be excited
by exogenous sources such as wind, and wave motion for offshore cranes. The non-
collocated nature of the actuation and the point to be controlled (payload) results
in complex dynamics. Productivity of cranes in ports, construction zones, etc., is
contingent on efﬁcient and robust elimination of residual vibration of the payload.
Controlling swing motion during the maneuver is also important to ensure collisions
are avoided with surrounding objects. Hubbell et al. [15] describes various control
problem in cranes which include: sway control, trim/list/skew control, and snag con-
trol. Sway control can be accomplished by recording expert crane operators motion
and reusing the recorded signal or by using real-time measurement of the system
states for feedback control. The trim/list/skew control is achieved by differential
motion of the ropes supporting the payload.
The cable in any crane can either be modeled as a distributed parameter system
which results in the wave equations describing the dynamic behavior of the cable
[16, 17]. This model is rarely used in control design. Lumped parameter models

Slosh Modeling
Slosh is blamed for the failure of NASA’s ATS-V satellite in 1969 [19]. Hubert
[20] describes how a small amount of liquid adversely affected the stability of the
spin-stabilized satellite, resulting in the loss of the mission. Similarly, rollover of
trucks carrying liquid cargo has been attributed to sloshing effect in partially ﬁlled
tanks [21]. The resulting spill of toxic material can at best cause inconvenience by
requiring evacuation and shutting down of transportation lines and at worst result
in death and damage to property. Bulk Transporter [22] cites 31 rollover incidents
related to transportation of petroleum by one petroleum reﬁner, in 2001. There is
clearly a need to model slosh and develop techniques to alleviate the effect of slosh
on the stability of the dynamic system.
Slosh is of concern in packaging industry as well where open containers carrying
ﬂuids have to be rapidly moved from ﬁlling stations to sealing stations to maximize
throughput [23]. Casting industries also need to move large quantities of molten
metal which mandates development of motion proﬁles which minimize slosh [24].

Vehicle Platooning
Intelligent vehicle highway systems (IVHS) is a catch-all concept to address vari-
ous issues related to relieving congestions in metropolitan highways [28]. Motivation
of increasing throughput, reducing fuel consumed, reducing lost productivity time
for drivers, are compelling auto manufacturers to develop technology to alleviate the
aforementioned issues. IVHS has the potential of improving safety of the highway
systems as well. The cost of augmenting the highway system to cater to increasing
trafﬁc is prohibitive in view of the ﬁnancial and environmental impact. With the in-
creased integration of sensors in vehicles and with reduced cost of microprocessors,
development of self-aware vehicles is viable.
Bae and Gerdes [29] present a simple model to represent the dynamics of a platoon
of tractor trailers. The goal of their research was to prevent actuator saturation of the
vehicles and ensure stability of the coupled tractor platoon. This includes string sta-
bility which implies that disturbances in the upstream inter-vehicle distance should
be attenuated as it travels downstream. The series of tractors can be represented by
lumped masses coupled by virtual springs and dashpots, resulting in a system with
underdamped response. Modifying the reference command to the lead vehicle was
shown to minimize the oscillatory behavior of the inter-tractor distance.
Figure 1.7 illustrates a series of tractor trailers moving in tandem. The protocol
for the platoons includes providing a reference command to the lead vehicle and
the follower vehicles only use knowledge of position and velocity of the preceding
vehicle to make decisions about motion control.
Each vehicle is modeled as a ﬁrst order system to represent the actuator delay.
Thus the transfer function relating the vehicle acceleration to the control input U
 s is:

Summary
This chapter details numerous examples which are characterized by underdamped
oscillatory motion when the dynamic system is tracking a reference input. A large
spectrum of applications are presented to illustrate that the techniques presented in
subsequent chapters are not limited to control of vibrations of structures. Rather,
they can be used to attenuate oscillatory motion excited by the reference input, which
changes the setpoint to the control system. Dynamic models with numerical values
are presented to permit the reader to design and evaluate controllers presented in this
book on examples of their interest.

P
RECISE position control and rapid rest-to-rest motion is the desired objective
in a variety of applications. The desire for reducing the maneuver time requires
reducing the inertia of the structure which usually reduces the stiffness. This re-
sults in the system response being dominated by the low resonance frequencies. The
maneuver time can also be reduced by increasing the available control force which
mandates larger actuators resulting in increased size and cost. If judiciously selected
feedback and/or feedforward controllers can be used to address the issues raised by
the lightly damped modes, one can achieve the beneﬁt of rapid maneuvering with
lightweight structures.
For illustrative purposes, consider a hard disk drive: time dedicated to transition-
ing from one cylinder to another has to be reduced to decrease access time. This
mandates driving the voice coil motor to its limits, which consequently results in
exciting the vibratory modes. Since, the position error of the read/write head has
to be less than 10% of the inter-track distance which translates to 25 nm for a drive
with 100,000 tracks per inch, damping of any vibration is necessary. Clearly, there
is a need to develop strategies, that minimize the residual vibration for such point-
to-point maneuvers.
The requirement of precise position control implies that the vibration of the struc-
ture should be zero or near zero at the end of the maneuver. Some applications that
are characterized by the low-frequency, low-damping dynamics include wafer scan-
ners [1], read/write arms of hard disk drives [2], gantry cranes [3], spacecraft with
ﬂexible appendages [4], and so forth. The natural impulse of control engineers is
to design feedback control which has a rich history of successful application and
proven ability in common place devices such as refrigerators, to esoteric applica-
tions such as control of hydrocephalus by pressure relief valves using sensors which
monitor intracranial pressure. Feedback controllers can broadly be classiﬁed as reg-
ulators where the objective is to maintain a set point, or tracking control where the
set point is a function of time. For tracking control, one has the option of manipulat-
ing the reference proﬁle so as to satisfy tracking objectives, desensitizing the system
response to modeling uncertainties, or satisfying desired transient state constraints.

Optimal Reference Shaping for Dynamical Systems: Theory and Applications
The shaping of the reference proﬁle requires no additional hardware, which makes
its inclusion into legacy systems quite easy.
The problem of rapid maneuvering of a ﬂexible structure between two quiescent
attitudes with the objective of minimizing structural vibration has been addressed
by many researchers. Swigert [5] parameterized the control proﬁle using a sum-
mation of ramp and harmonic (basis) functions and solved for coefﬁcients of the
basis function to satisfy boundary conditions and minimize the energy consumed.
Scientists interested in designing minimum time control proﬁles have exploited the
knowledge that the optimal solution for most systems requires the control to be at
its limits (maximum or minimum) and switch between the limits a ﬁnite number of
times. The switching between the limits which is referred to as bang-bang control
has been represented by hyperbolic tangent functions or splines which permits the
use of gradient based optimization algorithms to solve for the switch times. The mo-
tivation for using the hyperbolic tangent or the spline functions to approximate the
discontinuous switch is to minimize “ringing” of the higher modes of the structure
which can degrade the performance determined by the terminal state errors. A fairly
comprehensive treatment of this family of problems has been presented by Junkins
and Turner [6], Singh and Singhose [7], and Scrivener and Thompson [8].
Thus, there are two main issues which inﬂuence the performance of any control
technique for the point-to-point maneuvering of structures whose transients are dom-
inated by oscillations. These are:
  the natural frequency and damping ratio and the associated uncertainties of the
underdamped modes and
  the higher frequency modes which are generally unmodeled
Model based controllers exploit the knowledge of the system model to design feed-
back or open-loop control strategies. The effect of the errors in model parameters
on the stability and performance of the control system has to be analyzed prior to its
deployment. Similarly, the effect of the unmodeled dynamics which can result in in-
stability of some feedback control systems, has to be carefully studied. To illustrate
this, consider a system whose transfer function is:
Y
 s U

which is characterized by two undamped modes of frequencies ω = 1, and 10 rad/sec.
Assume that the higher frequency corresponds to an unmodeled mode. The step re-
sponses of the system considering only the low frequency mode and both the modes
are shown by the dashed and solid line respectively, in the ﬁrst subplot of Figure 2.3.
It is clear that the high frequency mode’s contribution to the system response is sig-
niﬁcantly smaller than that of the low frequency mode. Further, the system response
is marginally stable since there is no mechanism to dissipate the energy in the sys-
tem. A proportional-derivative (PD) controller can be used to stabilize the system
represented by the low frequency dynamics as shown in Figure 2.1. The effect of

the stabilizing PD controller on the behavior of the system represented by both the
modes is shown in the second subplot of Figure 2.3.
The response to an unit step input is shown by the dashed line in Figure 2.3 which
asymptotically approaches the ﬁnal value of 0.5. Simulating the same PD controller
with the unmodeled mode, as shown in Figure 2.2 results in an unstable response,
illustrated by the solid line in Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.2: PD Control of Complete Model
This simple example illustrates the fact that the effect of unmodeled dynamics on
the open-loop control system is small. However, the desired objective of forcing the
output to a ﬁnal value is unachievable. On the other hand, the effect of the unmodeled
dynamics on the closed-loop system is manifested in the form of instability. Since
the control designer can anticipate the response of the open-loop system to a given
input, the question of shaping the input to satisfy the ﬁnal value constraints is an
obvious problem to be studied.
Posicast Control
A very interesting technique was proposed by Tallman and Smith [9] which in-
volved splitting the input excitation into several segments such that the sum of all

transient terms equals zero after the last excitation. This technique was referred to as
the Posicast technique. Figure 2.4 illustrates schematically the response of a Posicast
controller.
The transfer function of the system illustrated in Figure 2.4 is one with undamped
poles. As shown in the upper part of the ﬁgure, the response of the system to a step
input of magnitude 0.5 is harmonic, with a peak magnitude of unity. Consider the
same step input applied to the system delayed by a time T as shown in the bottom half
of Figure 2.4. As anticipated, the response is harmonic and its initiation is delayed
by T. If the delay T is selected to be one-half of the period of oscillation of the
system output ( π
ω ), summing the output of the systems to the two step inputs results
in a nonoscillatory response as shown by the middle graph. Thus, replacing the unit
step input with a staircase input which is generated by summing the two steps of
magnitude 0.5, with one delayed by T seconds, results in a ﬁnite time point-to-point
transition. This staircase input can be represented as:

where H
    is the Heaviside unit step function.
The successful application of the Posicast controller is contingent on the precise
knowledge of the system’s natural frequency. Any errors in the estimated natural fre-
quency which corresponds to an incorrect selection of T results in poor performance
of the controller. This fact prevented the use of the Posicast controller for numerous
applications which are characterized by underdamped system response.

Figure 2.4: Posicast Control
In this chapter, we ﬁrst design a time-delay controller for a single mode system
and illustrate that the resulting solution is the same as the Posicast controller. To min-
imize the loss of performance due to errors in estimated model parameters, it will be
shown that multiple instances of this controller in cascade lead to controllers that
are less sensitive to parameter errors. We then design a time-delay controller, where
the time-delay is user selected, this is a generalization of the time-delay controller
proposed by Singh and Vadali [10]. This is followed by studying some properties
of the controller regarding the sign of the gains of the time-delay elements and pe-
riodicity of the controller. We refer to the magnitude of the delayed step input, as
the time-delay gain. A general procedure for the design of user selected time-delay
controllers for multi-mode systems is presented. The controller presented in Sec-
tion 2.3.2 is based on minimizing the time-delay with the gains of the time-delay
elements constrained to lie between 0 and 1. An indexing mechanism with a PD
controller is used to illustrate the time-delay controller.
Effects of high frequency unmodeled modes have been identiﬁed as a cause of
degradation of performance of controlled systems. Rolling off the frequency re-
sponse function as a function of frequency leads to simple techniques to alleviate
the problem caused by the high frequency unmodeled modes. These techniques are
expounded and tested on an illustrative example in Section 2.4. Finally, the design of
time-delay ﬁlters for discrete-time systems is presented and illustrated on the bench-
mark ﬂexible transmission problem.
An important point to note is that the techniques presented in this chapter deal with
shaping the reference input to the plant. The plant could represent an open-loop or

stable and its response is dominated by underdamped or undamped oscillations.

Proportional Plus Multiple Delay (PPMD) Control
The single time-delay ﬁlter, by virtue of canceling the poles corresponding to the
oscillatory behavior of the system, provides us with a technique to produce non-
oscillatory response. The cancelation of the poles of the system is contingent on
the availability of accurate data regarding them. To improve the robustness of the
time-delay ﬁlter to errors in estimated poles, a two-time-delay ﬁlter is proposed as
illustrated in Figure 2.7. The zeros of the ﬁlter are given by the equation:

The robustness of the time-delay ﬁlter to uncertainties in estimated damping and

magnitude of G s  in the vicinity of snom is reduced.

Optimal Reference Shaping for Dynamical Systems: Theory and Applications
To study the variation in the performance of the PPD and PPMD time-delay ﬁlters
in the presence of errors in estimated inertia of the system, the square root of the
residual energy of the systems driven by ﬁlters designed for the nominal systems are
determined and plotted in Figure 2.10. The solid line which corresponds to the PPD
ﬁlter illustrates that the performance of the PPD ﬁlter deteriorates rapidly as the error
in the estimated inertia increases. The results of the PPMD ﬁlter illustrated by the
dashed line conﬁrm the insensitivity of the PPMD ﬁlter in the vicinity of the nominal
model of the system.
2.2
Proportional Plus User Selected Multiple Delay Control
In the time-delay ﬁlter designed in Section 2.1, the time-delays appears non-
linearly in the equations, which increases the difﬁculty of arriving at closed-form
solutions for anything except a one or two mode system. The time-delay of the mul-
tiple time-delay controller is a function of the natural frequencies of the system. To
eliminate this constraint, we propose, in this section, a class of time-delay ﬁlters
where the time-delay is selected by the user, thus giving greater latitude to the de-
signer. The unknown gains of the time-delayed signals, which appear linearly, can
be easily solved for. Consider an underdamped second-order plant and a two-time-
delay ﬁlter (Figure 2.12) where T is selected by the user. We choose the second
time-delay to be twice that of the ﬁrst although this is not necessary. We need to
determine A0, A1, and A2 to cancel the poles of the system. We require that the zeros
of the time-delay ﬁlter be coincident with the system poles. The equations

function of the time-delay ﬁlter over the s-domain. It is clear that the function goes
to zero at the estimated location of the poles of the system. However, there is a rapid
increase in the magnitude as one moves away from the poles of the system. Thus,
any error in estimated frequency or damping, will lead to an oscillatory response to a
step input. To build robustness into the time-delay ﬁlter, we require that, in addition
to the cancelation of the poles of the system, the variation of Equations (2.50) and
(2.51) with respect to frequency be zero. This leads to a total of ﬁve equations with
three unknowns. We therefore introduce two more delays in the controller whose

It is to be noted that we will arrive at the same solution if we force the variations

increased with respect to errors in estimated frequency and damping.
2.2.1
Signs of the Time-Delay Gains
It might sometimes be required to limit the magnitude of the time-delay gains to
be positive, while satisfying Equation (2.52). This is desirable from a practical stand-
point as we would not require the actuator to track large steps, which could occur if
the time-delay gains were unconstrained. Hence, we require from Equation (2.54),
that the time-delay T satisfy

Figure 2.13 illustrates the variations of the gains of the time-delay ﬁlter as a func-
tion of the user selected time-delay. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that there exist
periodic intervals over which all the gains are positive. The ﬁgure is generated for a
system mode with a frequency of 1 and a damping ratio ζ of 0.1.

The time-delay ﬁlter leads to an inﬁnite number of zeros, one pair of which cancels
a pair of poles of the system. To determine the zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter as a

The time-delay ﬁlter can be mapped into the z-domain, where one can show that
the same objective is met, i.e., cancelation of the poles of the system by the time-
delay ﬁlter zeros. However, in the z-domain, we would solve a polynomial equation
to arrive at the zeros of the ﬁlter, which are ﬁnite in number, unlike in the s-domain
where we solve a transcendental equation to results in an inﬁnite set of zeros of the
ﬁlter.
2.3
Time-Delay Control of Multi-Mode Systems
The technique for the design of time-delay ﬁlters for single-mode systems can
be extended to multiple-mode systems by cascading the time-delay ﬁlters designed
for each mode. This will not lead to the smallest number of delay times to cancel
the dynamics of the two underdamped modes. Figure 2.14 illustrates the cascaded
time-delay ﬁlter for a multi-mode system.

Concurrent Time-Delay Filter Design for Multi-Mode Systems
Time-delay ﬁlters for multi-mode system can be designed by selecting the param-
eters of the ﬁlter to concurrently satisfy the pole cancelation constraints. Analytical
solutions to multi-mode systems can rarely be derived. This prompts posing an op-
timization problem to numerically design the time-delay ﬁlter. Consider a system
with m underdamped modes (poles). The time-delay ﬁlter can be parameterized as:

the reference proﬁle.
2.3.2
User Selected Time-Delay
The design of the time-delay ﬁlters in Section 2.2 was simpliﬁed as the unknowns
appeared linearly in the constraint equations. This concept can easily be extended to
the design of time-delay ﬁlters for systems with more than one mode of vibration.
The easiest design would be to connect the time-delay ﬁlters for each of the modes
in series. This, however, will not lead to the minimum number of delays in the

For certain values of T, the above matrix might become singular. In such cases, the
solution can be obtained by using the pseudo-inverse technique. The pseudo-inverse
solution will be exact for a row deﬁciency, but for a column rank deﬁciency, a least
square approximation solution results, which does not satisfy the constraints. In this
case, we need to select a different T so that column rank deﬁciency is avoided.

could ring the unmodeled dynamics of the system. This is undesirable for ﬂexible
structures. With all the time-delay gains being positive, we are assured that they
will lie in the range 0–1. We reformulate the design process so as to minimize the

Solution of the optimization problem leads to the desired time-delay ﬁlter. The

Jerk Limited Input Shapers
Jerk is the time rate of change of acceleration, i.e., the derivative of the control
input and is a measure of the impact level. Impact in mechanical systems is man-
ifested in the form of noise and reduces life due to fatigue. For various ﬂexible
structures, higher level of jerk correlates to exciting the higher modes of the system
which is commonly referred to as ringing. The input shaping/time-delay ﬁlter design
requires information of the natural frequency and damping ratio of speciﬁc modes to
be controlled. If it is necessary to roll off the energy over the high frequency spec-
trum, which includes unmodeled modes, additional constraints need to be included
in the ﬁlter design. It is interesting to note that human ballistic motion which refer
to movement initiated by robust muscular contractions followed by relaxed muscles
while the momentum carries the limbs to their ﬁnal destination, has been shown to
be jerk limited.
This section will address the problem of jerk limited input shapers for preﬁltering
command inputs to vibratory systems without rigid body modes. The papers by
Muenchhof and Singh [12, 13] addressed the problem of design of control proﬁles
for systems with rigid body modes. This section will start by addressing the design
of time-delay ﬁlters where the delay time and the gains of the delayed signals are

parameters to be solved for. This will be followed by the presentation of a general
concept to design input shapers by including additional dynamics to the time-delay
ﬁlter such as harmonic oscillators and ﬁrst order dynamics to permit smooth ramping
up and ramping down of control proﬁles.

So, for a given J or ω, we can solve for ω or J respectively for which T1 and T2 are
equal, which corresponds to a simple ramp input to the system.
Figures 2.19 and 2.20 illustrate the variation of the switch times and the ﬁnal time
of the time-delay ﬁlter as a function of varying jerk and frequency, respectively. It
is clear from Figure 2.20, that the ﬁrst and second switches coincide, which corre-
sponds to the solid line intersecting the dashed line. Figure 2.20 is generated for J
= 3, for which we have from Equation (2.105), ω = 6π, 18π, 30π, for which the
switches collapse, which corroborates the results in Figure 2.20.

2.5
Robust Jerk Limited Time-Delay Filter
Most systems have errors in estimated damping and natural frequencies which
can result in signiﬁcant residual errors when a rest-to-rest maneuver is performed.
It is therefore imperative to design ﬁlters which can handle uncertainties in esti-
mated model parameters. There are multiple approaches to achieve robustness. The
simplest includes reducing the sensitivity of the residual energy of the modes to un-
certain parameters, based on the nominal values of uncertain parameters. If bounds
and distributions of the uncertain parameters are available to the designer, the mini-
max approach proposed by Singh [15] can be used to arrive at ﬁlters which minimize
the maximum magnitude of the residual energy in the domain of interest. This will
be presented in detail in Chapter 5. In this development, robustness is achieved by
placing multiple zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter at the location of the uncertain poles
of the plant.
The added requirement of robustness results in a ﬁlter with increased number of
parameters to be determined. The approach for the design of robust jerk limited time-
delay ﬁlters is developed for damped systems with the knowledge that the undamped
systems are a subset of the damped system. The robust jerk limited time-delay ﬁlter
is parameterized as

To illustrate the reduced sensitivity of the residual energy to variations in the fre-
quency, the response of the system was studied for various values of model frequen-
cies with a ﬁlter designed for a frequency of 15 rad/sec and a permitted jerk of 4.
Figure 2.21 illustrates the improved performance of the robust jerk limited time-
delay ﬁlter.

Jerk Limited Time-Delay Filters for Multi-Mode Systems
The proposed approach can be used for the control of systems with multiple un-
derdamped modes. A generic formulation is developed below. The number of pa-
rameters to be optimized for can be reduced for undamped systems by exploiting
the symmetric characteristics of the time-delay ﬁlter. The transfer function of the
time-delay ﬁlter is

respect to damping simultaneously desensitizes the ﬁlter to the frequency as well.
The design of jerk limited time-delay ﬁlters for user speciﬁed time-delays follows
the process proposed described in Section 2.3.2. It is clear that additional number of
delays are required since the delay times are no longer variables in the optimization
process.

respectively. It is clear that the residual vibration of the two modes is eliminated after

Filtered Input Shapers
The technique presented in this section, where an integrator is concatenated to a
time-delay ﬁlter to satisfy the constraint of jerk limited ﬁlter design can be extended
by cascading other transfer functions such as that of ﬁrst-order systems, harmonic
systems, and so forth.
2.7.1
First-Order Filtered Input Shaper
Instead of using an integrator in conjunction with a time-delay ﬁlter to account for
the limit on the permitted jerk, one can concatenate a ﬁrst-order ﬁlter to a time-delay
ﬁlter to generate a smooth input which can then be used to drive a time-delay ﬁlter
designed to cancel the underdamped poles of the system of interest. Figure 2.23
illustrates the proposed ﬁlter structure where T is a user selected time-delay which
in the case of a discrete time implementation, can be an integral multiple of the
sampling interval.

Sinusoid Filtered Input Shaper
Filtering with a transfer function of a scaled sinusoid results in an input which
emulates a step input but with zero initial and ﬁnal slopes. The scaling of the sinusoid
transfer function is to satisfy the requirement that the DC gain of the transfer function
is unity. The sinusoid ﬁltered time-delay ﬁlter is illustrated in Figure 2.24, which can
be rewritten as shown in Figure 2.25.

from the frequency response plots of the sinusoid ﬁltered time-delay ﬁlter. Fig-
ure 2.27 illustrates the frequency response plots of the time-delay ﬁlter, jerk limited
time-delay ﬁlter and a sinusoid ﬁltered time-delay ﬁlter. The sinusoid ﬁltered time-
delay ﬁlter has been designed such that the maximum jerk of the control proﬁle is
equal to the maximum permitted jerk. It can easily be seen that the magnitude plots
of the sinusoid ﬁltered time-delay ﬁlters rolls off much more rapidly compared to
the time-delay ﬁlter and the jerk limited time-delay ﬁlter. Thus, this input will not
signiﬁcantly excite the unmodeled dynamics.

the damping present in the oscillatory pole to be canceled, the jerk can lie in the limit

If the pole to be canceled is undamped the maximum jerk is ω
4 since A0 and A1 are
equal to 0.5. When the poles to be canceled contain damping, A0 is greater than 0.5
and A1 is less than 0.5, resulting in the maximum jerk lying in the range speciﬁed by
Equation (2.126).
This constraint is valid when the time-delay ﬁlter is designed to cancel the un-
wanted underdamped pole. However, if the underdamped pole has to be controlled
using a robust time-delay ﬁlter, the limits on the jerk changes, since the robust time-
delay ﬁlter uses smaller gains.
Example 2.3:
To illustrate the beneﬁt of using the ﬁltered input shaper, consider a two-mass
system shown in Figure 2.29, which includes the dominant mass m which is driven by
a force transmitted through the spring of stiffness k. A secondary mass ms connected

where x is the displacement of the mass m in an inertial frame, y is the differential
displacement of mass ms with respect to mass m and r is the reference displace-
ment imposed on the system. Figure 2.30 illustrates the displacement of the two
masses. The parasitic response of mass ms is of high frequency and can be out-
side the bandwidth of the actuator. It is desirable to minimize the excitation of the
parasitic oscillations by shaping the reference input to the system.
Assuming m = 1, ms = 0.1, k = 1, ks = 50, the natural frequencies of the system
are ωi = 0.95 and 23.45 rad/sec. Designing a ﬁnite jerk Input Shaper, a ﬁrst-order
ﬁltered Input Shaper and a sinusoid ﬁltered Input Shaper with a jerk limit of 4, we
can compare the performance of these jerk limited input shapers to the standard PPD
time-delay ﬁlter (ZV Input Shaper). Figure 2.31 illustrates the shaped reference
proﬁles derived based on the four ﬁltering approaches listed above. Figure 2.32
presents the corresponding displacement of the main mass m and the parasitic mass
ms. The solid line, the dotted line, the dashed lines, and the dash-dot lines correspond
to the input shaper, jerk limited input shaper, the ﬁrst-order ﬁltered input shaper, and
the sinusoid ﬁltered input shaper, respectively. It is clear that the parasitic oscillations
of the sinusoid ﬁltered input shaper are signiﬁcantly smaller than the rest of the
shapers. The cost trade-off with reference to maneuver time is small as can be seen
in the evolution of the position of mass m.

Discrete-Time Time-Delay Filters
The pole-zero cancelation concept for the design of pre-ﬁlters can be extended to
discrete-time systems where the pre-ﬁlter is parameterized as a FIR (ﬁnite impulse
response) ﬁlter. Consider a general FIR ﬁlter of the form
H

(2.129)
which has k poles at the origin of the z-plane which implies stability. This ﬁlter is
also referred to as a moving average ﬁlter. The transfer function H
 z  has k zeros
whose locations are a function of ci. Selecting the cis so as to cancel the poles of
the system to be controlled results in the counterpart of the time-delay ﬁlter in the
discrete-time domain.
Figure 2.33 illustrates the implementation of a time-delay ﬁlter in the discrete-
time domain for a nth order system. The n poles of the system which are the roots

series results in the zero vibration derivative Input Shaper which provide robustness
to uncertainties in damping ratio and natural frequency simultaneously. The tech-
nique to design time-delay ﬁlters is extended to pre-ﬁlters where the delay times are
speciﬁed by the user. This is compatible with implementing it using a discrete time
control system. The time-delay ﬁltering techniques can also be used to minimize
residual vibration of multi-mode systems.
There are numerous applications where the goal of the control system is to perform
point-to-point maneuvers. The reference input to such systems is a step input. Filter-
ing the step input through a time-delay ﬁlter results in a staircase form of a reference
input which minimizes the magnitude of residual energy compared to the applica-
tion of the step input to the nominal system. The staircase input still might excite
higher modes and unmodeled dynamics and furthermore, actuators cannot track step

inputs. The section on jerk limited time-delay ﬁlters provides a technique to account
for the jerk limits on the actuator and also provide a mechanism to generate a refer-
ence proﬁle which reduces the excitation of the higher frequency unmodeled modes
as shown by the frequency response plots of the jerk limited time-delay ﬁltered sig-
nals. The jerk limited time-delay ﬁlter is generated by including an integrator into
the pre-ﬁlter. This motivated the design of ﬁltered Input Shapers where ﬁrst- and
higher-order ﬁlters are integrated with the standard time-delay ﬁlter and the result-
ing reference proﬁles are smooth, which further reduces the excitation of unmodeled
dynamics.
Although the development and illustration of the time-delay ﬁltering technique
has been illustrated for point-to-point control, the pre-ﬁltering of any reference in-
put results in nonoscillatory tracking of the reference input. For instance, requiring
the glass plate of a ﬂat-bed scanner to follow a trapezoidal velocity proﬁle can be
achieved by ﬁltering the reference velocity proﬁle through a time-delay ﬁlter. Simi-
larly, inserting a time-delay ﬁlter between a drive pendant of a gantry crane and the
actuators can reduce the pendulation of the crane to arbitrary inputs.

The optical pick-up of a compact disc (CD) player consists of a sledge for
large displacements and a radial servo which is limited to move over a few
hundred tracks. The optical pickup is a two-degree of freedom system with
one degree catering to the motion of an objective lens for focusing and a
second degree for ﬁne radial positioning. Vidal et al. [17] model the pick-
up as a two mass-spring system. Figure 2.42 illustrates a schematic of the
pickup system where mass m1 corresponds to the objective and m2 is the
mass of the objective suspension links. The model relating the displacement

Assume 16,000 tracks per inch (TPI) of track density, the intertrack distance
is 1.5875e-7 meters. To move the objective by 100 tracks requires a step
input reference signal of magnitude 0.0265 volts. Design a time-delay ﬁlter
to complete the seek motion of 100 tracks with no residual vibrations.

LASSICAL control refers to techniques that include Bode diagrams, Nyquist
plots, Nichols charts, and so forth, used to design controllers based on measures
such as gain and phase margins and bandwidth. Following the development of the
root-locus technique by Evans after World War II, time-domain approaches which
use measures such as percent overshoot, rise, settling, and peak time were used to
design controllers. The post–World War II period led to numerous breakthroughs
in controller design, which have been labeled modern control. Contributions by
Bellman, LaSalle, Pontryagin, Kalman, Bryson, and others laid the foundation for
what is currently referred to as optimal control. Optimal control has been extensively
used in aerospace, electrical, automotive and other applications. Recently, problems
of precision control of systems characterized by low frequency lightly damped modes
have been formulated as optimal control problems.
Chapter 2 presented a simple technique to shape the reference input to a stable or
marginally stable system, which minimizes the excitation of the underdamped modes
about the desired reference trajectory. The technique was illustrated on rest-to-rest
maneuvers only. The time-delay ﬁlter was designed so as to cancel the underdamped
poles of the system which resulted in rest-to-rest motion with no residual vibrations.
To address the problem of uncertainties in estimated model parameters, the time-
delay ﬁlter was required to place multiple sets of zeros at the nominal location of
the uncertain underdamped poles, which resulted in improved performance in the
proximity of the nominal model. The time-delay ﬁlter design was not posed as an
optimal control problem, but can be designed by posing an appropriate optimal con-
trol problem. This chapter will introduce the basic theory of optimal control and well
known controllers such as linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and frequency-shaped
LQR will be used to design optimal controllers for benchmark spring-mass systems.

Calculus of Variations
Optimal control theory is founded on the fundamentals of calculus of variations
whose roots can be traced to the Brachistochrone problem posed by Bernouilli in
1696 CE. The pioneering work of Euler (1741) which provides a geometrical ap-
proach to interpret the variational problem provided the seed for the development
of what is now referred to as calculus of variations. In 1755, 19-year-old Lagrange
wrote Euler a letter where he regenerated Euler’s results using an elegant method of
variations, which Euler embraced and called calculus of variations.
Calculus of variations was designed to extend results from the differential calculus,
notably necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for extreme values of ordinary functions
over ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces, to extreme values of functions of functions,
or functionals, over inﬁnite-dimensional function spaces. We begin by deriving the
Euler-Lagrange equations for a ﬁxed time, ﬁxed boundary conditions problem. This
is followed by the development of the constraints for the optimization of a functional
subject to differential equation constraints. Finally, the Hamiltonian formulation,
which results in the canonical representation of the necessary conditions of optimal-
ity is derived.

  is a functional, that is a mapping from a function space into a scalar.
The function space (in this case of continuously differentiable functions) is inﬁnite-
dimensional and the functional J
 x t
  t
  maps it to a real scalar space. It is assumed
that φ and x  t
  are continuously differentiable with respect to their arguments up to
order 2, i.e., they are C2. t0 and tf represent the initial and ﬁnal times, respectively,
and x  t0
  and x  tf
  are assumed to be ﬁxed. x  t
  represents the optimal and unknown
path which needs to be determined.
The increment of the functional J is deﬁned as

to be smooth and of class C2. The increment can therefore be represented as

Figure 3.3: Brachistochrone Solutions
Figure 3.3 illustrates the optimal shapes for three different end points. It can be
seen that for some end points, the mass has to move up toward the end of the maneu-
ver to complete it in minimum time.
The optimal shape which is a cycloid has another interesting property. Starting
from rest at any point on the curve, the time required to reach the lowest point is
the same. Hence, this curve is also called a tautochrone and was ﬁrst presented by
Huygens in 1657 CE [2].

Optimal Control

The control law which satisﬁes Equations (3.56) through (3.59) is called the op-
timal controller. Equation (3.58) is referred to as the optimality condition which
assumes that the control input is unbounded. If the control input is restricted to an
admissible set, the Pontryagin’s minimum principle (PMP) is sufﬁcient to determine
the optimal control law. The PMP states that the optimal control at any instant of
time satisﬁes the constraint

presence of model uncertainties, the objective was to minimize the residual vibra-
tion of the system response. The shaping or ﬁltering of the reference input is an
open-loop solution.
Wiener [4] developed a ﬁlter to minimize the effect of noise on a signal. He posed
an optimization problem where the goal was to minimize the expected value of the
square of the difference of the stationary noisy signal and the truth. Subsequently,
Kalman and Koepcke [5] used the same quadratic cost function to develop state
feedback controllers for linear systems. The resulting solution (LQR) is one of the
most popular and widely studied technique for feedback controller design. This
section will illustrate the formulation of the LQR problem.

that the terms of the Riccati matrix are nearly constant for the ﬁrst ten seconds of the

LQR without State Penalty
For the speciﬁc case of quadratic cost functions which are not a function of system
states, a closed-form expression for the open-loop control proﬁle can be derived to
move the system from speciﬁed initial to ﬁnal states in a speciﬁed time tf . This
section describes in detail the approach for designing the optimal control proﬁle.
Consider the cost function

Figure 3.12 illustrates the variation of the system states and control for the open-
loop optimal control proﬁle. Comparing Figure 3.12 to Figure 3.11 it is clear that the
optimal solutions are identical.
3.2.3
Desensitized LQR Control
It is desirous to design controllers which are robust to errors in model parameters,
i.e., they are insensitive to errors in estimated values of the parameters of the system
model. The motivation comes from the fact that in real physical systems, the values
which are assumed to be constant (e.g., natural frequency, damping ratio) are not
known exactly. When this is the case, the control proﬁle determined using estimated
model parameters will not move the system from its initial states to the desired ﬁnal
states. To desensitize the control proﬁle to errors in estimated model parameters, the
sensitivity of the system states to the uncertain parameters are forced to zero at the
end of the maneuver [7]. Consider the state-space model

Figure 3.13: Evolution of States and Control
Figure 3.13 illustrates the variation of the system states and control proﬁle for the
robust minimum power control proﬁle. The residual energies of the minimum power
and the robust minimum power control proﬁles for variations in estimated spring
stiffness is shown in Figure 3.14 where it is clear that around the nominal value of
the spring stiffness, the robust control proﬁle has increased the insensitivity of the
controllers to errors in estimated model parameter.
One can conjecture that the increased robustness of the control trade-offs an in-
crease in the performance index. The cost function corresponding to the optimal
control in Example 3.8 is 0.2098 and the cost function of the insensitive control in
Example 3.9 is 0.9784, a 366% increase which is a signiﬁcant penalty for the result-
ing robustness.

Minimum Power Control
Another important subset of the LQR problem is one where the state errors are
not penalized. Minimizing the integral of the quadratic of the input is referred to
as minimum power control. This section will describe the development of a closed-
form expression for the open-loop minimum power, point-to-point motion control.
The focus here is on the control of structures whose dynamics are represented by
second-order matrix differential equations.

robustness to uncertainties in the system parameters, the sensitivity states can be

the constraints that the sensitivity states be zero at the end of the maneuver will result

It is patent from Figure 3.17 which plots the residual energy of the system at
the end of the maneuver, that the robust minimum power control proﬁle provides
robustness to uncertainties of the spring stiffness around the nominal estimate of
the system model. The cost trade-off corresponds to an increase in the performance
index from 0.0504 (Example 3.10) to 0.0666 (Example 3.11), a modest 32% increase
in the power consumed.

3.3.3
Minimum Time/Power Control
The minimum power optimal control formulation requires the maneuver time to
be speciﬁed. In application such as disk drives for laptops, minimizing the consumed
power is clearly desirable. However, if the tradeoff of power versus maneuver time is
large, the resulting controller is not realistic. Minimization of a weighted combina-
tion of maneuver time and power consumed can lead to appealing control strategies
which permits users to dial up or down, the penalty associated with the maneuver
time and power consumed. This section will present the optimal control formulation
and illustrate it with two examples.
The cost function which minimizes a convex combination of the maneuver time
and the power consumed is:
J
   tf
0
  1
 α
  α 1
2uTRu
 dt
(3.241)
where α is a scalar which lies between zero and one and permits the cost function to
span the spectrum of minimum time control and minimum power control problems.
The positive deﬁnite matrix R permits relatively weighting inputs in a multi-input
control system. The linear model of the controlled system is:
˙x

and the controller is subject to the boundary conditions:

Figure 3.18 illustrates the variation of the cost J as a function of the maneuver time tf
for α = 0.5. The optimal maneuver time can be determined by a line search algorithm
and results in tf = 4.5315.
Figure 3.19 illustrates the variation of the maneuver time and the consumed power
as a function of the weighting parameter α.
The variation of power consumed
(dashed line) is plotted on a log scale which implies that the power consumed rapidly
reduces as α is increased from 0. It is also clear that the maneuver time (solid line)
varies slowly till α is close to 1.

Frequency-Shaped LQR Controller
The LQR design approach assumes that the model describing the system is valid
at all input frequencies. However, most models are inherently erroneous with both
structured and unstructured uncertainties. The structured uncertainties refers to the
errors in model parameters and unstructured uncertainties corresponds to unmodeled
dynamics. If one can include a penalty function which is a function of frequency, one

can then compensate for errors in system models in speciﬁc frequency regions. Gupta
[9] proposed an elegant approach to combine frequency domain penalty functions
into the classical LQR design process. This section describes the frequency shaped
LQR design process and illustrates it on the ﬂoating oscillator benchmark problem.
The standard LQR design process is related to the determination of a controller
which minimizes the cost function

where P is the solution of the algebraic Riccati equation

The Q and R matrices are the state and control penalty matrices, respectively, which
are generally constant matrices. The Parseval’s theorem [10] can be exploited to
rewrite the quadratic cost function (Equation 3.283) in the frequency domain as

In this formulation, it can be seen that the states and control are equally penalized
at all frequencies. In some systems, the actuators, sensors, or the system might have
poor characteristics at speciﬁc frequencies. Increasing the penalty of the states and
control at these frequencies permits shaping the frequency response characteristics
of the closed-loop system. The frequency-shaped cost function can be represented
as

Figure 3.21: System Response and Control Input
Figure 3.21 illustrates the displacement response of the two masses of the closed-
loop system and the corresponding control input. It is clear that an underdamped
oscillatory response dominates the response of the system. This corresponds to a
closed-loop frequency of ω = 1.3899, which corresponds to the undamped mode of
frequency ω = 1.4142 of the open-loop system. It is therefore warranted to penal-
ize the frequency content of the states at frequencies around the undamped natural
frequency of the uncontrolled system. A frequency domain quadratic cost function
which penalizes the velocity of the ﬁrst mass is proposed

potential energy in the spring of the benchmark problem is plotted in Figure 3.23

estimating the natural frequency of the benchmark problem, the frequency shaped
LQR controller can accommodate small errors and it reduces the magnitude plot in

LQR Control with Noisy Input
Real-world applications include situations when the system is subject to random
disturbance inputs. For instance, random wind gusts act as disturbances to the con-
trollers of the Segway scooter, helicopters, airplanes, the effect of waves on a ship-
borne crane, besides others. The effect of the disturbances in the presence of model-
ing uncertainties has been an active area of research over the past decade [12]. This

Burl [13] presents a simple development to prove that the optimal feedback gain

noisy input). The beneﬁt of using the development presented in this section is that
it provides P, the covariance of the states. One can pose constrained optimization
problems where the variance of a state can be required to be less than a designer
speciﬁed limit.

for optimality. The Hamiltonian formulation for the design of optimal controllers
was presented which was subsequently used to derive the optimal state feedback

problem was described and benchmark examples were used to illustrate the tech-
nique. The LQR problem has been extensively studied and some of the extensions to
the classic LQR problems were presented. These include the minimum power con-
trol problem, the desensitized LQR problem, and the frequency-shaped LQR prob-
lem, which provided a means to include frequency weighting in the design of the
state feedback controller.

Saturating Control
We know very little, and yet it is astonishing that we know so much,
and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much
power.
Bertrand Russell (1872–1970); English philosopher, mathematician
O
PTIMAL control is a phrase used to describe the ﬁeld of study where one en-
deavors to minimize or maximize a cost function subject to the dynamic model,
state and control constraints and has been extensively studied over the past 50 years.
Contributions by Pontryagin and Bellman laid the foundation on which the ﬁeld had
grown rapidly and matured. Table 4.1 lists a few applications in the ﬁrst column
and three parameters which are of interest in the optimal control formulation for the
listed applications. A check mark is used to highlight the parameters of interest.
These applications have been selected to motivate the cost functions which will be
presented in this chapter.
Consider a race car pit crew for a Formula 1 racing team. They would like to
minimize the time for their car to complete the racetrack in minimum time, subject
to the constraint that the available fuel is constrained. On the other hand, a subway
railcar that starts and stops frequently requires a control strategy that moves people
as rapidly as possible subject to constraints on the rate of change of acceleration
(jerk), which inﬂuences passenger comfort. It is clear that different applications de-
mand different performance metrics. In this chapter we will address the problem of

rest-to-rest maneuvers of systems where the control input is subject to saturation con-
straints. Four cost functions will be considered which include: (1) Minimum-Time,
(2) Minimum Fuel/Time, (3) Fuel Limited Time Optimal, and (4) Jerk Limited Time
Optimal Control problems. All the optimal controllers presented in this chapter are
open-loop. For real-world applications, models which are used for the design of
controllers invariably include modeling errors, process and sensor noise, and ini-
tial condition uncertainties. In such situations, open-loop controllers cannot reliably
satisfy terminal state constraint. A hybrid control scheme where the open-loop con-
trollers are used to move the states to the vicinity of desired states and subsequently
a feedback controller is used to asymptotically reach the ﬁnal states, is a potential
approach for obtaining the beneﬁts of open-loop and closed-loop controllers. These
open-loop controllers can also be used to generate nominal control and state proﬁles
which in conjunction with a tracking feedback controller can inﬂuence the states
such that the tracking error asymptotically tends to zero. All of the aforementioned
problems will be solved for the rest-to-rest maneuver of a double integrator which
represents the motion of a rigid body and the ﬂoating oscillator benchmark problem
which captures the characteristics of a maneuvering ﬂexible structure [1].

The decoupled equations are used to derive the constraint equations for the optimiza-

Every section in this chapter will study three problems. The ﬁrst corresponds to
the rigid body model given by Equation (4.6a). The next problem studied is the
undamped benchmark problem and ﬁnally, the results of the effect of damping on
the solution to the benchmark problem will be presented.

the Hamiltonian H is not affected by any selection of the control u  t

lem is called a singular time-optimal problem. Figure 4.2 schematically illustrates a

Since exp ATt

solution, a singular solution requires that the controllability matrix be singular which
corresponds to an uncontrollable linear time invariant system. Thus, a controllable
system is normal and the resulting time-optimal control is bang-bang.
4.2.2
Rigid Body
With the knowledge that the time-optimal control is bang-bang, the control proﬁle
can be represented as the output of a time-delay ﬁlter subject to a step input which is
parameterized to generate a bang-bangcontrol proﬁle. For example, the time-optimal
control proﬁle for a rest-to-rest maneuver of double integrator,

The time-optimal control of any linear controllable time invariant system can be
stated as the design of a time-delay ﬁlter so that a set of zeros of the transfer function
of the time-delay ﬁlter cancel all the poles of the system.
4.2.3
Time-Optimal Rest-to-Rest Maneuvers
Many researchers have noted the antisymmetric characteristic of the minimum-
time control proﬁles designed for rest-to-rest maneuvers for ﬂexible structures with-
out damping [5–7]. The term antisymmetry refers to proﬁles which can be generated
by rotating the ﬁrst half of the proﬁle about the mid-maneuver time, by π radians.
For example, a single period of a sinusoid (sin ωt
 ) is antisymmetric since the pro-
ﬁle from t=0 to π
ω when rotated about the point t= π
ω , which is half the period of
oscillation, by π radians, generates one cycle of the sinusoid.
We ﬁrst show that a control proﬁle that is antisymmetric about the mid-maneuver
time leads to a transfer function of a time-delay ﬁlter with two zeros at the origin of
the s plane. Figure 4.5 illustrates the minimum-time control proﬁle for an undamped
system with the time delays selected to ensure antisymmetry. The transfer function
of a time-delay ﬁlter (Figure 4.4) containing 2n+2 time-delays (2n+1 switches) is

where the mass matrix M is positive deﬁnite, and K is the stiffness matrix which
is positive deﬁnite or positive semideﬁnite. The stiffness matrix is positive semi-

given by Equation (4.38) can be represented in a modal form as:

tions (4.31) and (4.32) which are derived by forcing zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter to

it can be seen that the pole-zero cancelation constraint is equivalent to forcing the
displacement and velocity of the ﬂexible modes to zero at the ﬁnal time. Finally,
Equation (4.46) can be shown to be the same as Equation (4.36) which illustrates
that the boundary conditions for the states of a rest-to-rest maneuver are satisﬁed by
designing a time-delay ﬁlter whose zeros cancel the poles of the system and which
is required to satisfy the ﬁnal value constraint given by Equation (4.36).

The parameter optimization problem to be solved includes nonlinear constraints
and may have multiple solutions. To verify the optimality of the switch times arrived
at from the parameter optimization problem, the satisfaction of the costate equations
and the optimality conditions which results in the switching control, need to be ver-
iﬁed. Since the costate equation for the minimum-time optimal control problem for

This single switch control proﬁle cancels the poles corresponding to the rigid body
and ﬂexible modes. This can be easily explained by studying Equation (4.20) which
lists the location of zeros of a single-switch bang-bang control proﬁle. Substituting
the switch time given by Equation (4.59) into Equation (4.20), the time-delay ﬁlter

Effect of Damping
The time-optimal control proﬁle for systems with damping are no longer antisym-
metric about the mid-maneuver time [8]. With this in mind, the transfer function of
a time-delay ﬁlter which generates the optimal control proﬁle can be parameterized
as:

from zero to one [9, 10]. The spring stiffness is assumed to be k = 50 and the rigid
body displacement yf = 0.5. Figure 4.7 plots the variation of the switch times and the
maneuver time as a function of the damping ratio. It is clear that for small and large
magnitude of the damping ratio, the time-optimal control includes three switches.
However, for a certain region of the damping ratio, the time-optimal control proﬁle
includes ﬁve switches. Figure 4.8 illustrates the switching function and the corre-
sponding time-optimal control proﬁle for three values of the damping ratios. It can
be conjectured that as the damping ratio is increased, two switches are introduced
towards the end of the maneuver. As the damping ratio is further increased, two
switches near the middle of the maneuver coalesce resulting in a three-switch con-
trol proﬁle.

the equation
u
  sgn  BTλ
 t

(4.73)
which indicates that the control input changes sign when the switching function
BTλ
 t
  passes through zero. With the variation of certain parameters in the con-
trol problem, switches can be introduced or eliminated from the control structure. If
there exists a control proﬁle transition created by switches appearing at the initial or
ﬁnal time of the control input, the equation that has to be satisﬁed is
BTλ
 ttran
  0
(4.74)
at the initial or ﬁnal time respectively, since only one switch can enter from either
end of the time boundaries. The variation of the costates with respect to the system
parameters is assumed to be smooth. Since the costates are smooth functions of
time, if the switches appear in between the initial and ﬁnal time, then two switches
are introduced simultaneously and the transition occurs when the equations [10]

(4.75a)

are satisﬁed. Equation (4.75a) is the constraint that forces the value of the switching
function to be zero at the transition point, and Equation (4.75b) indicates that the
slope of the switching curve at the transition point should also be zero.
A parameter optimization problem is solved where the parameters to be solved
for are the damping ratio and the time which corresponds to when Equations (4.75a)
and (4.75b) are simultaneously satisﬁed. Figure 4.9 illustrates the transition of the
time-optimal control proﬁle from a three-switch to a ﬁve-switch control proﬁle as the
damping is increased. Figure 4.10 corresponds to the transition from a ﬁve switch to
a three switch control proﬁle as the damping is increased.
Deﬁning fuel consumed as
  tf
0
 u   dt, it is clear that the bang-bang control proﬁle
corresponds to a large consumption of fuel. In applications where the available fuel
is limited such as satellites, laptop computers, hybrid or plug-in cars, and so forth,
control policies which maximize the operation life or range of the application be-
tween recharge would be the optimization objective. A judicious balance between
fuel consumed and maneuver time can be posed as a fuel/time optimal control prob-
lem. The next section addresses this problem.

With the knowledge that the time-optimal control is bang-off-bang, the control
proﬁle can be represented as the output of a time-delay ﬁlter subject to a step input
which is parameterized to generate a bang-off-bang control proﬁle. For example, the

is:

Fuel/Time Optimal Rest-to-Rest Maneuver
As in the case of time-optimal control proﬁles for undamped systems, the fuel/time
optimal control proﬁle for undamped ﬂexible structures with a rigid body mode is
antisymmetric about the mid-maneuver time (Figure 4.14) and this information is
exploited in the parameterization of the transfer function of a time-delay ﬁlter which
generates a bang-off-bang proﬁle when subject to a unit step input [15]. The transfer

Sufﬁciency Conditions
As in the case of the design of time-optimal control, the parameter optimization
problem for the fuel/time optimal control problem can result in multiple solutions,
since the constraints are nonlinear. To corroborate the optimality of the control pro-
ﬁle, the rest of the necessary conditions for optimality have to be veriﬁed. This
includes the deadzone function which deﬁnes the optimal control in terms of the
optimal costates. The costates for the system

Benchmark Problem
With the knowledge that the fuel/time optimal control proﬁle is bang-off-bang,
we construct a time-delay ﬁlter whose output is bang-off-bang when it is subject to a
step-input. The amplitudes of the time-delayed signals are constrained by the bounds

on the control, requiring the determination of the time-delays to completely specify
the time-delay ﬁlter.
To deﬁne the time-delay ﬁlter completely, one can formulate a constrained pa-
rameter optimization problem, where the parameters to be determined are the time-
delays. To eliminate any residual vibration of the system, the complex poles located
at
 jω have to be canceled by a complex conjugate pair of zeros of the time-delay
ﬁlter leading to the ﬁrst constraint. The next constraint, to satisfy the boundary con-
ditions, is arrived at by integrating the rigid body equation of motion. Singh and
Vadali [16] have illustrated that the transfer function of a time-delay ﬁlter that gen-
erates a control proﬁle which is antisymmetric about its mid-maneuver time, has a
minimum of two zeros at the origin of the complex plane, which cancel the rigid body
poles of the system. This fact is exploited to reduce the dimension of the parameter
search space.
We consider the problem of reorientation, i.e., a rest-to-rest maneuver with bound-
ary conditions

Since the cost J is a unimodal function for positive n (negative n are not valid as
they imply a negative cost J), we can solve for nopt that minimizes J, assuming n is
continuous. The integer values that ﬂank nopt are used to determine the optimum n.

Since n is an integer, the value of J corresponding to the integer values of n that ﬂank
the value of n estimated by Equation (4.136) are evaluated to determine the optimum
n. A point to note is that the optimal control proﬁle leads to displacement of the
rigid body mode at mid-maneuver time which is half of the total maneuver and the
displacement of the vibratory mode which is zero at the mid-maneuver time.
Since, the structure of the control proﬁle for the rigid body and the benchmark
problem are identical, it is informative to plot the variation of the switch times and
the maneuver time as a function of α. Figure 4.16 illustrates the variation of the ﬁrst
switch time for the rigid body (dashed line) and the benchmark problem. It can be
seen that the switch time remains constant for a range of α. Figure 4.17 illustrates
the variation of the maneuver time versus α. It can be seen that for some values of α,
the maneuver time of the benchmark problem is smaller than the rigid body system.
However, as is shown in Figure 4.18, the variation of the cost function of the rigid
body system is either equal to or smaller than the cost of the benchmark problem.
Figure 4.18 also illustrates the variation of the parameter n as a function of α.
It was shown in Section 4.2 that the time-optimal control proﬁle, which corre-
sponds to α=0, is a three-switch bang-bang proﬁle, which is antisymmetric about
the mid-maneuver time. Since, the fuel/time optimal control proﬁle should in the
limit tend toward the time-optimal control proﬁle (α
  0), it is clear that a transi-
tion control proﬁle should exist which can generate the two-switch bang-off-bang,

For θf = 1, Figure 4.21 illustrates the variation of the structure of the control proﬁle.
As expected, for α = 0, the control proﬁle is bang-bang. Increasing α, the penalty
on fuel consumed results in the three switches of the bang-bang control splitting into
six switches of a bang-off-bang proﬁle. Further increase in α leads to a transition oc-
curring at αcr = 0.6824, where the two pulses near the mid-maneuver time collapse,
resulting in a two-switch bang-off-bang control proﬁle.
4.3.7
Effect of Damping
As in the case of the time-optimal control, the structure of the fuel/time optimal
control proﬁle is not antisymmetric about the mid-maneuver time. This implies that
as the weighting parameter α of the fuel/time cost function is varied, there will be
a transition when two switches of the bang-off-bang control proﬁle collapse. How-
ever, unlike the undamped case where four switches collapsed simultaneously, in the
damped case two switches will collapse at a time. To conﬁrm this conjecture, the
damped benchmark problem is studied with a damping ratio of ζ = 0.1.
Two switches of the bang-off-bang control proﬁle collapse when

Figure 4.23: Switch Time Variation
Consider the problem of planning a control strategy for a race car to complete a
race circuit in minimum time, with a ﬁnite amount of fuel. The fuel/time optimal
control problem where a soft constraint is imposed on the fuel consumed would not
be the appropriate problem formulation. One approach is to search for the value
of α which solves the fuel/time optimal control problem with exactly the permitted
fuel usage. But this requires solving the fuel/time problem many times. Another
approach is to minimize time while setting a hard constraint on the fuel. To impose
hard constraints on the fuel consumed, an integral constraint has to be imposed.
The next section will develop the fuel limited, minimum-time control problem and
illustrates that the optimal solution corresponds to a speciﬁc penalty imposed on fuel
consumed in the fuel/time optimal control formulation.

Singular Fuel Constrained Time-Optimal Control
The same proof which illustrated that ﬂexible structures with rigid body modes
cannot support singular fuel/time optimal control is valid for the fuel constrained
time-optimal control.

Rigid Body
With the knowledge that the fuel constrained time-optimal control is bang-off-
bang, the control proﬁle can be represented as the output of a time-delay ﬁlter subject
to a step input which is parameterized to generate a bang-off-bang control proﬁle.

Since the switching curve φ0λ2 is a straight line, the fuel constrained time-optimal
control proﬁle is a two-switch bang-off-bang proﬁle and can be parameterized as
shown in Figure 4.24. The initial control pulse accelerates the mass to reach a cruis-
ing velocity which reduce time to the desired terminal location while consuming
half of the available fuel, while the antisymmetric pulse is needed to decelerate the
system to settle into the desired terminal state.

Benchmark Problem
In this section, the fuel constrained time-optimal control of the benchmark prob-
lem is presented. With the knowledge that the fuel constrained time-optimal control
proﬁle has a bang-off-bangstructure, the control proﬁle for the undamped system can
be parameterized to reﬂect the antisymmetry about the mid-maneuver time. Since,
the control proﬁle is three-switch bang-bang when an unlimited fuel supply is avail-
able, one can conjecture that the three-switch bang-bang control proﬁle morphs to a
six-switch bang-off-bang proﬁle (Figure 4.14). Having parameterized the bang-off-
bang control proﬁle, the following parameter optimization problem can be solved to
determine a candidate optimal solution:

satisfy all the necessary constraints except for displacements which match that given

trates the spectrum of the structure of the optimal control proﬁle over a permitted
fuel ranging from 0.4 to 1.5.
One can see the change in the structure of the optimal control proﬁle as a function
of varying the damping constant. Figure 4.32 illustrates the variation of the switch
times of a six- to a four-switch-control proﬁle at c
  0  156, with increasing damping
constant.
Biomimetics or Bio inspired design has captured the imagination of numerous
researchers in the robotics and control communities. Emulate nature and you cannot
go wrong is an axiom numerous researchers have taken to heart. Recently, Ben-Itzak
and Karniel [18] illustrated that humans reaching motion is one which is jerk limited.
This has prompted the focusing of research interest in the development of control
strategies which satisfy constraints on jerk. Jerk which also goes by the moniker jolt,

Jerk Limited Time-Optimal Control
Jerk is the time rate of change of the inertia forces, i.e., the derivative of the con-
trol input and is a measure of the impact level. Impact in mechanical systems is
manifested in the form of noise and reduces life due to fatigue. For various ﬂexible
structures, higher level of jerk correlates to exciting the higher modes of the system
which commonly are commonly referred to as ringing. For systems where the ac-
tuator is not an on-off device, but can be throttled, jerk limited time-optimal control
proﬁles are desirable since they can reduce noise and the consequences of fatigue.
Furthermore, the actuators are better able to track the optimal control proﬁle since
bandwidth limitations make it difﬁcult to track bang-bang proﬁles.
This section addresses the problem of design of jerk limited time-optimal control
proﬁles for rest-to-rest motion of systems. To include limits on the rate of change
of the control, a new state is introduced into the model which represents the control
input to the system. The rate of change of the control is now the input to be de-

There exists boundary conditions for the rest-to-rest maneuver for which the con-
straint is active. The optimal jerk proﬁle (v) is a bang-off-bang proﬁle as shown in
Figure 4.34(i).
Since, the optimal control proﬁle is a combination of a number of time-delayed
ramp functions, the requirement of time-optimality can be satisﬁed by ensuring that

Jerk Limited Time-Optimal Rest-to-Rest Maneuver
The optimal jerk-constrained control proﬁle will be the combination of a num-
ber of time-delayed ramp functions with different slopes. The requirement of time-
optimality can be satisﬁed by ensuring that u  t
  is in saturation for as much time
as possible during the maneuver. This is justiﬁed by the bang-bang principle [22],
which states that if an optimal control exists, then there is always a bang-bang con-
trol proﬁle that is optimal. Hence, if the optimal control is unique, it is bang-bang.
For the controller presented in this section, the jerk is the control variable. Thus, the
jerk proﬁle will be bang-bang, resulting in a ramping control input. For larger per-
missible amounts of jerk, the control input will eventually reach the saturation level.
Then a bang-off-bang proﬁle will be used. In the off-phases, the control input u  t
 remains saturated, exerting the maximum possible control authority.
It will be assumed that the actuator has symmetric limits in u  t
 , therefore umax
  umin
  1. The time rate of change is limited by
  ˙u  t
    J and is parameterized as
shown in Figure 4.38(i). The resulting control proﬁle is shown in Figure 4.38(ii).

costate constraints have to be studied. The switching function for the augmented
system λ TB
  ψ should equal zero when control reaches a boundary arc, i.e., when
one of the state constraint becomes active. Figure 4.40 illustrates the evolution of
the switching function (solid line) and the evolution of the switching function with
no state constraints (dashed line). Equation (4.216c) states that the derivative of the
costate equation ψ is discontinuous when the state constraint becomes active and the
associated singular control is given by the equations

discontinuity as shown in Figure 4.40. Since the switching function is equal to zero
every time the state constraints become active, the initial costates can be determined
from the equation

the transition to jerk limited control proﬁle results in a parameterization of an eight-

the unconstrained time-optimal control proﬁle corresponding to a switch of the jerk
proﬁle.
It can be seen from Figure 4.41 that the jerk proﬁle can be described by two pa-
rameters, the time of the ﬁrst zero crossing T1 of the control input u, and the mid-
maneuver time, Tmid. This is the reﬂection of the fact that for large jerk, the ﬁrst
switch is equal to 1  J, i.e., the time required for the control input to reach its satu-
ration limit of unity and the transition time from the upper and lower bound of the
control takes 2  J. The jerk proﬁle can therefore be parameterized as

Figure 4.42: Case 1: Variation of Switch Times vs. Jerk
Figure 4.42 illustrates the variation of the switch time as a function of permitted
jerk. It can be see that the structure of the jerk proﬁle changes from an eight-switch
bang-off-bang to a six-switch proﬁle. This is due to the fact that the third and fourth
and the ﬁfth and sixth switches collapse into each other. For a displacement of unity,
this occurs for a jerk of J = 1.7539. At this transition, i.e., when the third and fourth
and the ﬁfth and sixth collapse into each other, the jerk proﬁle shown in Figure 4.43
can be parameterized as

Equation (4.283) is a transcendental function which can be used to solve for Tmid
given a desired ﬁnal displacement of yf .
It is conceivable that instead of the third and fourth and the ﬁfth and sixth switches
coalescing, the ﬁrst and second and the seventh and eighth could coalesce for a dif-
ferent set of model parameters. The transition equations for this scenario can be
derived as shown above.

For jerk values below that corresponding to the transition given by Equation (4.283),
the control magnitude does not saturate in the region where the switches have col-
lapsed. The maximum magnitude of the control input in this region becomes a vari-
able to be optimized for.
Figure 4.44 illustrates the jerk proﬁle parameterized in terms of the mid-maneuver
time Tmid, and u2 which corresponds to the maximum magnitude of the control in the
region where the switches have collapsed. The jerk proﬁle can be described by the

occurs for a jerk of J = 1.445065. At this transition, i.e., when the ﬁrst and second
and the ﬁfth and sixth collapse into each other, the jerk proﬁle parameterized by

Since the state constraints are not active for this case as well, the corroboration of
optimality for this case is identical to that of the time-optimal control problem.
Figure 4.50 illustrates that the switching curves start from a triangular proﬁle and
as the permitted jerk is decreased, ends up with a triangular control proﬁle again. It
can be seen that two switches are introduced earlier to the ﬁrst switch of the triangular
control proﬁle and as the jerk is decreases, the second switch drifts towards the third
and coalesces with it reducing the jerk proﬁle to one which generates a triangular
control input.
To illustrate the entire spectrum of control proﬁles, the entire suite of proﬁles and
the variations of switch times as a function of jerk are presented in Figure 4.51. It
can be seen from Figure 4.51 that reducing the jerk from J
  ∞to J = 2, the ﬁnal
time increases from 4.2179 to 4.8017, a small increase in maneuver time while the
fuel consumed drops from 4.2179 to 2.8017, a signiﬁcant percentage. To study the

calculated and its magnitude is plotted in Figure 4.52 which clearly demonstrates
that the energy injected into the higher frequency modes is reduced.
Figure 4.53 illustrates the optimal jerk proﬁles and the corresponding switching
function for the four distinct cases described in this section. It can be seen that for
Cases 1 and 2, singular intervals exist. For Cases 3 and 4, the control input never
saturates and the switching function does not include any singular intervals.
For the Hubble telescope, the rate of change of jerk (snap) was considered in the
design process. One can easily extend the techniques presented in this chapter to
design controllers that are subject to constraints on snap, or the rate of change of
snap (crackle), or the rate of change of crackle (pop), to successively develop control
proﬁles whose frequency spectrum has an increased roll off at higher frequencies
resulting in smoother control proﬁles.

Summary
The objective of this chapter was to present design of controllers with control
constraints. The cost function studied are:
  Time-Optimal Control
  Fuel/Time Optimal Control
  Fuel Limited Time-Optimal Control
  Jerk Limited Time-Optimal Control
All the cost functions selected for design resulted in controllers which can be char-
acterized as bang-bang or bang-off-bang controllers. Such control proﬁles can be
represented as the sum of time-delayed step inputs of different amplitudes. The am-
plitudes deﬁne whether the resulting control proﬁle is bang-bang or bang-off-bang.
The combined time-delayed step inputs can be generated by a time-delay ﬁlter sub-
ject to a unit step input which corresponds to the reference input for a rest-to-rest

values, can then be posed as the design of the time-delays of a time-delay ﬁlter so as
to cancel all the poles of the system and satisfy the rigid body boundary conditions.

The Hamiltonian formulation is used to derive the necessary conditions for opti-
mality. Since only part of the necessary conditions for optimality are used to arrive at
the parameter optimization problem, the satisfaction of the remaining necessary con-
ditions need to be corroborated to guarantee optimality. A simple technique is used
to determine the initial costates which can then be used to determine the switching
function. If the control proﬁle resulting from the switching function is coincident
with that determined from the parameter optimization problem, optimality is guar-
anteed.
For all the cost functions considered in this chapter, closed form solutions for the
optimal control for a rigid body system are derived. This is followed by a study of
the undamped ﬂoating oscillator benchmark problem. Parametric studies related to
variation of the ﬁnal displacement, damping ratio, weighting factor of the cost func-
tion, and so forth, are studied for their effect on the structure of the optimal control
proﬁles. Except for the jerk limited time-optimal control problem, none of the other
cost functions resulted in singular control proﬁles for rest-to-rest maneuvers.

Minimax Control
If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because
they do not realize how complicated life is.
John von Neumann (1903-1957); Hungarian–American mathematician
C
HAPTERS 2, 3, and 4 described various techniques for the control of systems
with vibratory modes. These techniques are model–based and are often sen-
sitive to errors in model parameters. In Chapter 2, the sensitivity of the pole-zero
cancelation constraints with respect to the uncertain model parameters was used to
design ﬁlters/controllers. The resulting control proﬁles are robust around the nominal
model of the system. Thus, for shaping the reference input to a system with model-
ing errors, it was shown that by cascading multiple instances of the time-delay ﬁlter
designed to cancel the poles of the system, resulted in a ﬁlter that was insensitive to
error in modeled natural frequency and damping ratio. The idea of locating multi-
ple zeros of a time-delay ﬁlter at the estimated location of the poles of the system
has been exploited to design robust time-optimal control [1,2], robust fuel/time opti-
mal control [3], fuel constrained time-optimal control [4], and so forth, as shown in
Chapter 4. The concept of using terminal state sensitivities with respect to the uncer-
tain model parameters can be extended to nonlinear systems undergoing rest-to-rest
maneuver, and has been shown to result in robust control by Liu and Singh [5].
If knowledge of the range of uncertainty or the probability distribution function
(pdf) of the uncertain parameter is available, developing control algorithms that can
exploit this knowledge in the design of the pre-ﬁlters or feedback controllers seems
patent. One can consider a worst case design over the domain of uncertainty. This
would entail design of a controller which minimizes the maximum magnitude of the
cost function over the domain of uncertainty. If the knowledge is in the form of a
pdf then minimizing the expected performance index over that pdf is an alternative
to minimizing the maximum over domain which includes regions of extreme un-
likelihood. Particularly in the case where the region of support is unbounded (e.g.,
Gaussian), one must minimax over the entire space, which is computationally chal-
lenging. For a system with one uncertain parameter, Figure 5.1 illustrates the varia-
tion of the cost function over the range of uncertainty. The objective of the control
design is to minimize the maximum magnitude of the cost over the range plb and
pub, the lower and upper bound of the uncertain parameter p. In this chapter, a mini-
max optimization problem is formulated to design controllers which are robust over

a speciﬁed range of uncertainties. This approach can accommodate distribution of
the uncertainties. First, a technique for the design of time-delay pre-ﬁlters which
shape the reference input to the system is presented. The objective of the design is to
arrive at an optimal pre-ﬁlter which minimizes the maximum magnitude of the resid-
ual vibration of a system undergoing rest-to-rest maneuvers. This is followed by the
development of feedback controllers which minimize a performance index which is
an inﬁnite time horizon, integral of a quadratic function of the system states.

Minimax Time-Delay Filters
Minimax is a word used in decision theory, game theory and statistics when one
is interested in minmizing the worst outcome. In a control design setting, one can
consider the uncertain model parameter such as the spring stiffness to take a value
which maximizes the residual energy over the domain of uncertainty, for a rest-to-
rest maneuver. The minimax control objective is to determine the parameters of
the controller to minimize the worst (i.e., largest) residual energy. This worst case

design obviously trades off performance in the nominal case for robustness. This
section will formulate the optimization problem for the design of time-delay ﬁlters
for uncertain mechanical systems undergoing rest-to-rest maneuvers.

where x represents the generalized coordinates and M the mass matrix is positive

rigid body modes. p is a vector of uncertain parameters which satisﬁes the con-
straints:

the objective of a rest-to-rest maneuver is to move the system from its initial state

system at the end of the maneuver as the cost function. For systems without rigid
body modes, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy at the end of the maneuver

to the kinetic and potential energy [6]. The pseudo-potential energy term is equal to
zero when the rigid body mode has zero energy. The augmented cost function is

For the design of robust controllers where the domain of uncertainty of the vector

lated to minimize the maximum magnitude of the residual energy over the domain

where Γ is the covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution and pnom is the vector
of nominal value of the uncertain parameters. The Γ matrix is diagonal if all the un-
certain parameters are independent. For distributions whose support is unbounded,
one can limit the support to include 95–99% of the most likely values. Figure 5.2
illustrate some of the distributions for a single uncertain parameter case, that one
can exploit in the design of the minimax controller. These distributions can be nor-
malized such that the area under the curve is equal to one. However, this is not
necessary since the optimization algorithm uses these distributions to differentially
weight various parameter sets over the uncertain domain.

where H

  is the Heaviside function, T0 is zero and N is the number of delays
in the ﬁlter. From Equation (5.7), it is clear that the input u can be represented by
a sum of delayed step inputs and since the system we are considering is linear, the
magnitude of the states at any time can be determined by the sum of the states at
any time due to each of the delayed step inputs. The van Loan identity is an efﬁcient
technique for the calculation of the states of a system subject to a step input, at any
time.

It can be seen that the upper right hand term of the matrix Z is the convolution in-
tegral of the system given by Equation (5.8) subject to a unit step input. Thus, the
value of the states at time T for a unit step input are given by the ﬁrst n rows of
the last column of Z. This permits us to calculate the ﬁnal states for a step input
accurately, without numerical integration. This is very attractive for numerical opti-
mization where a signiﬁcant cost of optimizing dynamical system is contributed by
the numerical simulation of the response of the system. For instance, the response of
the system represented by Equation (5.8) to the input represented by Equation (5.7)
is given by the ﬁrst n rows of the last column of the matrix

The optimization algorithms which are used to solve minimax problems are gen-
erally gradient based. Thus, the accuracy and the speed of the optimization can be
increased by providing analytical gradients to the optimization algorithm. Fortu-
nately, for the time-delay control, closed form equations representing the gradients
of the cost and constraints can be easily derived as shown below.
For the optimization algorithm, we require the value of the gradient of the cost F
and the constraints, with respect to the controller parameters. For the control given
by Equation (5.7), the gradients of F (Equation 5.3) with respect to Ai and Ti are
given by

ence input to the underdamped system so as to minimize the maximum magnitude
of the residual vibration over the range of uncertainty, for a rest-to-rest maneuver.

In Chapter 2, it was shown that a single time-delay ﬁlter that is designed to locate a
pair of zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter at the nominal location of the underdamped poles
of the system results in a ﬁnite-time interval for a rest-to-rest maneuver. This solution
corresponds to the Posicast solution [8]. It has also been shown that by cascading
this single time-delay ﬁlter, i.e., locating multiple pairs of zeros of the time-delay
ﬁlter at the nominal location of the underdamped poles, results in robustness around
the nominal poles of the system [9]. In this design, the only information necessary is
the location of the nominal poles of the system. Often, the range of uncertainty and
the distribution of uncertainty is known in addition to the nominal parameters of the
system. The technique presented in this chapter endeavors to exploit this knowledge
in the design of a robust pre-ﬁlter. Since the basic robust time-delay ﬁlter consists
of two time-delays, we start by studying the minimax problem by considering the
two-time-delay ﬁlter. The transfer function of the time-delay ﬁlter is:

Figure 5.4 (dotted line) illustrates the variation of the residual energy of the sys-
tem as a function of the uncertain parameter k. It can be seen that the maximum
magnitude of the residual energy in the range of the uncertain parameters occurs
at the bounding limits (k = 0.7, k = 1.3) and at a value of k which lies between
the limits. It is also clear that the maximum magnitude of the residual energy is

signiﬁcantly smaller than that resulting from the robust time-delay ﬁlter deﬁned by
Equation (2.40) over the entire range of k. However, at the nominal value of k = 1, the
minimax solution has a large magnitude of residual vibration. The minimax solution
is similar to the extra-insensitive input shaper proposed by Singhose et al. [10] where
an optimization problem is formulated by deﬁning the magnitude of residual vibra-
tion permitted at the nominal value of the uncertain parameter and solving for the
magnitudes of a sequence of impulses. The impulse sequence is required to satisfy
the constraints that the magnitude of the residual vibration is zero at two frequencies
which ﬂank the nominal value and the slope of the residual energy distribution is
zero at the nominal value of the uncertain parameter.

The trade-off resulting from the minimax design is evident from Figure 5.4. Min-
imizing the maximum magnitude of the residual vibration over the range of uncer-
tainty has required an increase in the magnitude of residual vibration at and near the
nominal value of the uncertain parameter. To address this disadvantage, an additional
constraint can be included in the optimization problem which requires the magnitude
of the residual vibration at the nominal value of k, be forced to zero. This can only
be achieved by adding a time-delay to the two time-delay ﬁlter, which implies that
the maneuver will take longer. The transfer function of this pre-ﬁlter is

Figure 5.5 illustrates the distribution of the residual energy of the time-delay ﬁlter
designed by cascading three nonrobust time-delay ﬁlters (solid line) and the minimax
time-delay ﬁlter (dashed line). It is clear from Figure 5.5 that the maximum magni-
tude of the residual energy of the minimax controller over the uncertain range (0.7
 k
  1.3), is signiﬁcantly smaller than the robust three-time-delay controller, which is
a metric to gauge the robustness of the controllers. One should note that the improved
performance at and near the nominal value of the uncertain parameter is acquired at
a cost of an increase in the maneuver time compared to the two-time-delay ﬁlter.

nonrobust ﬁlter results in zero residual energy. However, over the entire uncertain
region, the minimax ﬁlter outperforms the nonrobust ﬁlter.

expound techniques that have been proposed by Bryson et al. [12,13] for the design
of controllers which minimize the maximum quadratic function of the systems states

Minimax Feedback Controllers
We will ﬁrst consider the design of feedback controller for uncertain systems
where knowledge of the range and distribution of uncertainties are known. A mini-
max optimization problem is formulated to arrive at feedback gains to minimize the
worst performance of a plant over the uncertain space. The cost function which will
be minimized is the integral of a quadratic function of the states and control:

Since the system is stable only for c greater than 0, we are only interested in the
graph which corresponds to c

  2 is the opti-
mal solution which corresponds to the critically damped case. However, it can be
seen that the graph has a discontinuity around the origin which corresponds to the
transition from the stable to the unstable region. To prevent this, a scaled version
of the negative of the reciprocal of J is plotted and is shown by the dashed line. It
is clear that the minimum of this function coincides with that of J, but it does not
include the discontinuity around the origin which is a useful property for gradient
based optimization algorithms.

The design problem is to determine the feedback gain which minimizes the maxi-
mum magnitude of the cost (Equation 5.63) over the entire range of uncertainty. For
one or two uncertain parameters, it is reasonable to discretize the uncertain region
and determine the cost function at each of the grid points. However, for systems
with a large number of uncertainty, this does not result in a feasible approach for the
determination of the minimax solution. Bryson and Mills [12] propose to determine
the cost at the corners of the uncertain hypercube and minimize the maximum mag-
nitude of the cost over all the vertices (Figure 5.14). The small cube at the center
of the uncertain cube represents the location of the nominal plant parameter set and
the vertices of the cube are functions of the lower or upper bounds of the uncertain
parameters.

correspond to Knom and Kminimax respectively. The ﬁnal stem corresponds to the cost
of the nominal plant. The dashed lines correspond to the gain Knom and it is clear
that the maximum magnitude of the cost for the gain Kminimax had been reduced.
Concurrently the cost of the nominal plant has increased, as a trade-off.
5.2.1
Exponentially Weighted LQR Cost
The Q and the R matrices of the standard LQR cost function deﬁne the relative
penalty of the states and the control input. The penalty is not a function of time
and all state and control variations from zero are equally penalized for all time. For
applications such as the docking or the intercept problem, it is desirable to design
controllers where the penalty on the state and control excursions from zero are pe-
nalized with an exponentially growing function. The following development presents
controller design for an exponentially weighted quadratic-cost function.
Consider the cost which penalizes the integral-quadratic cost of states and control,

cost for the gain Kminimax had been reduced. Concurrently the cost of the nominal
plant has increased, as a trade-off.
Figure 5.18 illustrates the variation of the reciprocal of the integral-quadratic func-
tion of the states and control input as a function of % variation of the model parame-
ters from the nominal parameter set. A σ of zero corresponds to the cost function for
the nominal plant and for any σ greater than 0, the largest cost evaluated over the set
of plants corresponding to the vertices of the uncertain hypercube is plotted. When
the graph goes to zero, that corresponds to the transition from a stable to an unstable
region. These graphs are generated for the standard LQR problem, the proposed cost
function evaluated for the nominal plant and a minimax problem solved for a σ of
0.3. Two other curves are generated where the integral-quadratic cost is penalized
by an exponentially increasing function of time for a λ equal to 0.1.
The larger the cost for σ equal to 0, the better the integral-quadratic cost. The
dashed line corresponds to the LQR problem, and the solid lines corresponds to
the solution of a optimization problem using the cost J
  1  tr
 ΣP  . Here the
maximum magnitude of J
  1  tr
 ΣP   is minimized with a σ of 0.3. It can be
seen that the solution of the minimax optimization results in increased gain margin
compared to the curve corresponding the solution based on the nominal plant only.
It is also clear that the performance of the nominal plant deteriorates. This is an
expected trade-off. It can also be seen that as the exponential penalty increases,
the gain-margin increases with a corresponding decrease in the performance for the

for the nominal plant is better than that of the output feedback controller. This is due
to the fact that the state at time t contains complete information of how the future
will evolve when given the input, while the output does not.

Summary
High-ﬁdelity representation of dynamical models ensures experimental reproduc-
tion of the performance expected based on numerical simulations. However, expe-
rience informs us that model truncation, errors in estimated model parameters and
variation of model parameters as a function of the environment preclude an accurate
representation of the system model. In such scenarios one would like to ensure some
baseline performance of the controlled system over the domain of model errors. This
problem can be posed as a “worst case design,” i.e, the system models which gener-
ates the worst performance are the ones which most inﬂuence the controller design.
Under perfect nominal conditions, this minimax pre-ﬁlter or feedback controller can-
not reproduce the performance of a controller designed for the nominal model only.

It can guarantee that no other controller will have a better performance over the en-
tire uncertain domain. This chapter dealt with minimax design of time-delay ﬁlters
and full state feedback controllers which minimize a quadratic cost. The trade-off
between performance and robustness is illustrated for both the pre-ﬁlters and feed-
back controllers. The technique presented in this chapter can easily be extended to
discrete-time systems.

Friction Control
In science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to the
man to whom the idea ﬁrst occurred.
Sir William Osler (1849–1919); Canadian physician
F
RICTION is a nonlinearity which is ubiquitous. In applications where very high
precision is desired and where the system dynamics are characterized by ﬂexible
modes, the presence of friction poses a challenge to the design of controllers for rest-
to-rest maneuvers. For systems where the coefﬁcients of friction and the damping
and natural frequencies of the ﬂexible modes are uncertain, there is a need to design
desensitized controllers.
Numerous applications such as hard disk drives, ﬂexible arm robots, high-precision
machine tools, servo-motors, and so forth, are applications where the presence of
friction is a signiﬁcant factor in the deterioration of the performance of these devices.
Thus, there is a motivation to study controllers which can account for the presence
of friction and track a desired output accurately. This chapter presents techniques
for the design of controllers for systems undergoing rest-to-rest maneuvers in the
presence of friction. First, the time-optimal control problem will be addressed. This
will be followed by a detailed development of pulse-width pulse-amplitude modu-
lated control techniques for rigid body system. The chapter will conclude with the
extension of the pulse-width pulse-amplitude technique to the motion control of the
ﬂexible benchmark problem.

Time-Optimal Rest-to-Rest Maneuvers
Maneuvering structures from quiescent initial conditions to quiescent ﬁnal condi-
tions in minimum time have applications in hard disk drives [1, 2], digital versatile
discs [3], industrial robots [4, 5], and container cranes [6], which are used to load
and unload ships, and so forth. All these applications have joints that are subject to
friction which signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the positioning accuracy of controllers. This
section will consider the simplest model of friction, Coulomb friction, and develop

minimum-time control proﬁles for rest-to-rest maneuvers. As in earlier chapters, a
rigid body is used as the ﬁrst example to illustrate the design technique. This is
followed by the development of the optimal controller for ﬂexible structures.

   (6.6)
The resulting control proﬁle becomes bang-bang, where the input switch is deter-
mined by the switching function, BTλ.
6.1.1.1
Parameterization of Linearizing Input
In Equation (6.1), the equation of motion is nonlinear because of the signum func-
tion in the Coulomb friction model. To eliminate the nonlinearity attributed to the
signum function, a simple technique is presented in this section which permits pa-
rameterization of the new input to the system which includes the external input and
the friction force. This net input now acts on a linear system, permitting the use of
all the tools available for the design of controllers for linear systems.
Assume that the time-optimal control proﬁle for the problem in Equation (6.1) is
a one-switch bang-bang proﬁle. By deﬁning a linearizing net input such that [7]
unet
  u
  fcsgn ˙x   (6.7)
the system equation of motion becomes linear. However, the new linearizing net
input is not a bang-bang proﬁle anymore. Figure 6.2 illustrates how the linearizing
net input can be determined. First, the velocity proﬁle of the optimal control proﬁle
is assumed as shown in the top plot of Figure 6.2. T1 and T3 correspond to the
time when the velocity of the frictional body becomes zero, and T2 is the time when
the actual control input switches. The friction force can be determined from this
velocity proﬁle which is shown in the third plot of Figure 6.2. Then the linearizing
net input can be determined as the sum of actual input and friction force as shown
in the last plot of Figure 6.2. Now the linearizing net input can be parameterized
by the unknown velocity and control switches, and ﬁnal time [T1 T2 T3 Tf ]. Without
losing generality, for a rigid body system, we can assume that the ﬁnal position of
the mass is always greater than the initial position of the mass, i.e., x1
 Tf
   x1
 0  .
Then the spectrum of velocity proﬁles of the general time-optimal problem consist
of four cases shown in Figure 6.3, depending on the initial and ﬁnal states of the
system. Based on these cases, the linearizing net control input for the corresponding
velocity proﬁle can be written as:

The three unknown switch and ﬁnal times, [T1 T2 Tf ] can now be solved from Equa-
tion (6.13). It is also possible to formulate a problem using time-delay ﬁlters. The
linearizing net input, unet

Then, zeros of G s  are designed to cancel the poles of the rigid body while satisfy-
ing the displacement constraint. Similar procedures are used to ﬁnd the linearizing
control inputs, unet
 iii  and unet
 iv .
6.1.1.2
Optimality Condition
For a rigid body with Coulomb friction, the control proﬁle is a one-switch bang-
bang with the switching curve BTλ. To show that the resulting control proﬁle is
optimal, the switching curve is computed to show that it passes through zero at the
actual switch time.
Assume that the control input has a switch at
  time instants (Ti
 i
  1  2     
)
and the velocity of the rigid body changes its sign m times at the kth
j time instant Tkj
(j

   m). For example, in Figure 6.2, T2 is the actual control switch and T1 and
T3 are the velocity switches. Therefore,
   2, k1

general case, the optimal control problem in Equation (6.1) can be rewritten with the

Therefore, the jump discontinuity in the costates has to meet continuous Hamiltonian
requirements. The costates are computed from differential equation of the costates
in Equation (6.22) with the initial costates. Since the initial costate vector is un-
known, the fact that the switching function is zero at the control switch is used.
First, costates are integrated in terms of initial costates λ
 0   forward in time. Since
costates are discontinuous at the interior point where the velocity of the mass is zero,
the discontinuity in the function is handled by deﬁning

Flexible Structure
In contrast to rigid-body systems which are only subject to the control and fric-
tion forces, ﬂexible structures include additional spring and damping forces which
complicate the analysis and synthesis of minimum-time control proﬁles. This sec-
tion presents a detailed development of the design of time-optimal control proﬁles
for rest-to-rest maneuvers of ﬂexible structures which are represented as a chain of
spring-mass-dampers. The assumption in this development is that the control and
friction forces act on the same mass.

where BTλ

  is the switching function. Therefore, the time-optimal solution for
this system is a bang-bang proﬁle. However, this may not be always true for the
frictional ﬂexible systems because of the additional state constraints imposed on the
optimal control problem. This is due to the fact that the friction force varies to match
the imposed forces when the velocity of the frictional body is zero. For a time-
optimal control proﬁle for the rigid body, it is guaranteed that the control input is
always larger than the force needed to initiate the movement when there is a velocity
reversal. For a ﬂexible system, however, external forces acting on the frictional
body include the input and spring forces, and the available friction force becomes a
function of the external forces acting on the frictional mass, when the net force to
the frictional body is not enough to initiate the motion (i.e., when stiction occurs).
Therefore, the bang-bang control proﬁle in Equation (6.48) is only valid when the
external forces to the frictional body at the velocity reversal are greater than the
resisting friction force. The bang-bang control input is parameterized in the next
section and the transitions of the control input as a function of displacement are
presented in later sections.

6.1.2.2
Linearizing Net Input and Parameterization of Control
It was shown previously that the time-delay ﬁlter can be used to cancel the dynam-
ics of a ﬂexible systems undergoing rest-to-rest maneuvers. The time-delay ﬁlter can
be used for the ﬂexible systems with friction if the linearizing net input formulation
is used. The system equation shown in Equation (6.43) can be rewritten in a linear
form as:
˙x
 t
  Axt
 Bunet

The linearizing net input, unet

body, resulting in the equation
unet
 t
  u t
   fcsgn  ˙xs
 (6.50)
In order to solve the time-optimal problem using the time-delay ﬁlter technique, the
zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter should cancel out the rigid body and ﬂexible poles in
addition to satisfying the displacement boundary conditions of the problem. With
the net control input, the velocity of the frictional body must be zero when the sign
of the frictional force changes. Figure 6.6 shows a schematic of the thought process
in developing this technique for a two-mass-spring system where the control and
frictional force are acting on the ﬁrst mass. The ﬁrst plot in Figure 6.6 shows the
assumed velocity proﬁle of the ﬁrst mass. The second plot in Figure 6.6 is the actual
input to the system, which is described by Equation (6.48), assuming no singular
interval, to be bang-bang. The linearizing net input is parameterized and is shown
in the ﬁnal plot, which is the sum of actual input and friction force. For the general
system shown in Figure 6.5, assuming that the control has n switch times at the
 th
i time instant (i
  1
   n). The velocity of the sth mass is assumed to change its
sign m times at the kth

G s  must cancel out all of the poles of the system while the control input satisﬁes

is canceled due to Equation (6.51) having a zero at s
  0. To cancel the other rigid
body pole, the derivative of Equation (6.51) with respect to s must also have a zero
at s

Variation of Control Structure as a Function of Final Position
In the previous example, the velocity of the ﬁrst mass is zero at T2 and T4. As
the ﬁnal position increases for the previous example, the time gap between T3 and
T4 becomes smaller until they coincide. The control proﬁle for this transition shown

shown in Figure 6.10 after the transition displacement, creates an overconstrained
problem. Therefore, the velocity of the ﬁrst mass should cross zero before the new
control switch activates. This implies that now T3 is the time when the velocity
is zero and T4 is the time when the control switches. At T
 3 , the velocity becomes
positive and therefore the friction force becomes
 fc. However, the linearizing input
with the new friction value drives the ﬁrst mass to the negative direction if the net
input is less than zero. Once the ﬁrst mass crosses the zero velocity, the net input
changes its sign again because of the change in friction value to
 fc. This chattering

effect will continue until the sum of all the forces to the frictional body overcomes
the friction force. Another interpretation of this region is by introducing stiction
instead of chattering. Since the sum of all the applied forces to the ﬁrst mass is
not large enough to overcome static friction, the velocity of the ﬁrst mass stays zero
until the new control switch is activated to overcome static friction. One way to
formulate an optimal control problem with stiction is adding an additional constraint
to the problem such that the velocity of the ﬁrst mass is zero for this time interval.
For the example problem, the predicted velocity proﬁle of the ﬁrst mass is plotted in
Figure 6.11 illustrating that the velocity of the ﬁrst mass is zero until the new switch
activates. It is also possible that the spring force itself can overcome the friction force
before the new control switch occurs, which will require an additional constraint
satisfying the constraint that the spring force is equal to the Coulomb friction value
at the exit of the zero velocity domain. With the velocity proﬁle in Figure 6.11, a

Equation (6.88) has a state equality constraint on the velocity of the ﬁrst mass. Be-
cause of this constraint, the friction force during stiction is considered zero. Bryson
and Ho [8] have developed a method to handle the state equality constraints in the
optimal control problem. From [8], Equation (6.88) can be restated as

It is interesting to see that although the control input needed for the ﬁrst mass to be
immobile for T3
  t
  T4 is deﬁned by Equation (6.90), because of the assumption of
stiction during the interval, it is possible to use a constant control input value of u
  1. Now, the control proﬁle can be parameterized from the predicted velocity proﬁle
including the state constraint effect of stiction. The time-delay ﬁlter cannot be used
for this proﬁle because of the feedback control effect in the chattering interval which
alters the system equation. However, the control proﬁle can be used to integrate the
system forward in time using the given initial guesses of the switch times to obtain

In Figure 6.12, the linearizing control input along with the switching curve is plot-
ted. The Hamiltonian is also plotted which is zero for all time. The actual control
input is computed by subtracting the frictional force from the linearizing control in-
put. Because the friction force is zero when the velocity of the ﬁrst mass is zero,
the linearizing input is equal to the actual input in the stiction region. However, the
actual control input becomes u
  1 for the stiction interval, since the compensa-
tion of the spring force is not necessary to stay stuck. Therefore, the actual control
input becomes a three switch bang-bang. The resulting net control input satisﬁes the
necessary optimality conditions as shown in Figure 6.12.

As the ﬁnal displacement is increased further, the proﬁle of the control shows
another transition where the velocity of the ﬁrst mass can be illustrated as shown in
the upper plot in Figure 6.13. The control proﬁle can be solved in a manner similar
to the previous development, when the velocity of the ﬁrst mass is forced to zero for

The switch times are plotted as a function of ﬁnal displacement showing that con-

This section focused on the design of time-optimal control proﬁles for systems
subject to Coulomb friction which result in an open-loop control solution. There are
legacy systems that are plagued by the effects of friction and which use feedback con-
trol for tracking reference inputs. These feedback controlled systems can maneuver
the systems states to the proximity of the desired position, but the effect of friction
is manifested in the form of steady state error. The following section deals with the

Pulse-Width Pulse-Amplitude Control
For small motions of systems subject to friction, Yang and Tomizuka [10] pro-
posed a technique that uses the pulse-width control (PWC). Here, it is assumed that
a standard feedback control is used to move the system to the vicinity of the desired
ﬁnal position. The presence of inaccurate knowledge of friction precludes the accu-
rate tracking of the desired position. In such a setting, an adaptive PWC technique
can be used to accurately move the system to the desired position. This technique will
be presented as a precursor to the development of the pulse-width pulse-amplitude
control (PWPAC) technique.

Rigid Body
This section will review the pulse-width control technique proposed by Yang and
Tomizuka [10] for a rigid-body system subject to Coulomb friction. The beneﬁt of
estimating the coefﬁcient of friction and using it in conjunction with the pulse-width
control will be illustrated. This will be followed by the development of the pulse-
amplitude pulse-width control technique that will be shown to reduce the terminal
position error compared to pulse-width control.

It is clear from Figure 6.18(ii) that the overestimation of the coefﬁcient of friction
results in a net displacement which is larger than anticipated for each pulse. This
results in a series of pulses whose signs change and whose widths monotonically
decrease as shown in Figure 6.18(i).
Figure 6.19 presents the phase plots of the pulse-width control for the case where
the friction is under- and overestimated. When friction is overestimated, signiﬁcant
overshoot can result which might be undesirable when displacement constraints are
imposed on the motion of the system.

Adaptive Pulse-Width Control
The friction model used for the determination of the pulse width is a simple one,
which does not capture the stiction, Stribeck effect, and so forth. Therefore, the
ﬁnal displacement will differ from the desired displacement. Subsequent pulses are
required to move the system to within a prespeciﬁed tolerance of the ﬁnal desired
position. This prompts the use of an algorithm for the real-time estimation of the
friction coefﬁcient ( ˆfc) which can subsequently be used to solve for the pulse width
to drive the system to the ﬁnal position. Assuming that only the pulse width can be
modiﬁed for each implementation of the pulse, Yang and Tomizuka [10] suggested
representing the system displacement dynamics as:

The superscript H stands for the Hermitian transpose. In this case, all values are
real and thus H can be replaced by T. In [11], K is described as the time-varying
gain vector and P as the inverse correlation matrix. The λ in the algorithm represents
the forgetting factor. Generally, the forgetting factor is selected to be smaller than
but close to 1 and is set to 1 if all data is to be equally weighted. If the forgetting
factor is not required, λ should be set to 1.
For the initiation of the adaptation algorithm, initial conditions for P  0   and ˆb  0  are required. ˆb  0   should be chosen as accurately as possible and the inverse covari-
ance matrix P  0   is set to P  0   δ

and small if otherwise.
Assuming a true friction coefﬁcient of 0.3 and an initial estimate of friction of
0.25, simulation results with a pulse amplitude of 1 are illustrated in Figure 6.21.

Figure 6.23 illustrates the evolution of the estimate of the friction coefﬁcient and
it is clear that they tend toward the true friction coefﬁcient of 0.3.
The nonadaptive system resulted in an unstable response when a friction estimate
of 0.5 was used for a system with a true friction of 0.3. Figure 6.24 illustrates the

Pulse-Amplitude Pulse-Width Control (PAPWC)
The PAPWC permits adaptation of the amplitude of the pulse in addition to pulse
width. This additional degree of freedom is exploited in digital implementation of
the PAPWC since the pulse width of the PWC might not coincide with an integer
multiple of the sampling interval. Since the desired displacement remains the same
for the PWC and the PAPWC, altering the pulse width results in an adjustment of the
pulse amplitude as well.

The constant b must change to b

Instead of using tp and up, the control pulse is speciﬁed by Tx and u

for the implementation of the PAPWC scheme.

Optimal Reference Shaping for Dynamical Systems: Theory and Applications
Assuming as in the section on adaptive pulse-width control, a true friction coefﬁ-
cient of 0.3 and an initial estimate of the coefﬁcient of friction of 0.25 and 0.35, nu-
merical simulations are used to illustrate the beneﬁt of the adaptive pulse-amplitude
pulse-width control. Figures 6.25 and 6.26 illustrate the control proﬁles and the cor-
responding evolution of the system states. It is clear from Figures 6.25 and 6.26 that
the maneuver time is 4.641 and 4.93 seconds, for the maneuvers which correspond
to an underestimation and overestimation of the coefﬁcient of friction, respectively.
This compares to 5.020 and 4.648 seconds, for the adaptive pulse-width control.

A true comparison of the adaptive PWC and PAPWC requires that identical sam-
pling times be selected. In the section on adaptive PWC, it was assumed that the
pulse width could be implemented without any round-off of the maneuver time to an
integer multiple of the sampling time. Figures 6.28 and 6.29 illustrate the time evolu-
tion of the system states and the control proﬁles when the controller is initiated with
an under- and an overestimate of the coefﬁcient of friction respectively. The solid
lines correspond to the adaptive PWC and the dashed line to the adaptive PAPWC.
It is clear from Figure 6.28, that the adaptive PWC results in a limit cycle. In both
scenarios, the adaptive PAPWC outperforms the adaptive PWC. A sampling time of
Ts
  0  05 was selected for the simulation.

Benchmark Problem
This section will extend the pulse-amplitude pulse-width control technique for
point-to-point control of the benchmark ﬂoating oscillator system subject to friction.
A three pulse control is parameterized which assumes that the velocity of the mass
subject to friction will not change sign over the duration of the maneuver. The pole-
zero cancelation approach developed in Chapter 2 will be exploited in the design of
the control proﬁle.
6.2.2.1
Problem Formulation
The ﬂoating oscillator under the inﬂuence of friction is illustrated in Figure 6.30,
where m1, m2 are the ﬁrst and second mass, k is the spring constant, u the control
input, f the friction force and x1, x2 are the positions of the ﬁrst and second mass.
The equation of motion of the system can be written as

In our development, a three pulse proﬁle is initially assumed as shown in Figure
6.31(a). The control proﬁle results in an active control period of time T3 at which
point the system is traveling with nonzero velocity [13]. Following the implementa-
tion of the third pulse, the system is allowed to coast to rest. The pulse widths are

the velocity state of the ﬁrst mass is assumed to remain positive over the duration
of the maneuver, the new input to the linear system is biased by the magnitude of
Coulomb friction as shown in Figure 6.31(b). The Coulomb friction biased input can

In order to eliminate the vibration at the end of the maneuver, a pair of zeros of

The ﬁnal time can be found by adding the coasting time to T3. Since, satisfying
Equations (6.161) and (6.162) is equivalent to the ﬂexible states being forced to zero
at the ﬁnal time, the coasting time is found by solving the rigid body equation for

If the ﬂexible motion states q  Tf
  and ˙q Tf

residual vibration will be eliminated. Since the ﬁnal time in Equation (6.166) is a
function of pulse amplitudes, Equations (6.161) and (6.162) are difﬁcult to solve.
To address this problem, the states of the ﬂexible mode at t

ﬂexible motion to be zero at the ﬁnal time are derived. Solutions of the ﬂexible mode

maneuver time is a function of pulse amplitudes and therefore, an iterative approach
is used to ﬁnd the total maneuver time and Tc. Rewriting the constraint Equations

To ﬁnd initial values for the input pulse amplitudes and ﬁnal time, solve Equation
(6.173) for A1, A2, and A3 in terms of A0 by letting q  T3
   ˙q  T3
   0. By substi-
tuting A1, A2, and A3 into the rigid body constraint in Equation (6.163), A0 can be
determined. Once the pulse amplitudes are found, the ﬁnal time is found by substi-
tuting the pulse amplitudes into Equation (6.166). With this initial Tf , ﬂexible states
at t
  T3 are computed using Equation (6.172). The new pulse amplitudes and total
maneuver time is calculated with these new ﬂexible states at t
  T3. This procedure
is repeated until the ﬂexible states and ﬁnal time converge.
Instead of the iterative approach proposed in this section, an optimization problem
can be posed to minimize Tc subject to the constraints given by Equations (6.163),
(6.166), (6.172), and (6.173), where the variables to be solved for are A0

coincident with that of the optimization algorithm.

Bounds on Control Pulse
The multiple pulse input development so far allows the user to select pulse widths
for the prescribed displacement. However, bounds on pulse amplitudes should be
examined because of the positive velocity constraint. The ﬁrst pulse amplitude A0
should be greater than the static friction, fs. Also, the pulse amplitude should be less
than the permitted peak input amplitude, up. Therefore, the bounds on A0 become

designed. However, the model of the system will be represented by a series of piece-

Incorrect estimates of the friction and frequency of the system result in a steady
state error and residual vibration at the ﬁnal time. Figure 6.37 represents the steady
state error of the ﬁrst mass with respect to variations in the spring constant and
Coulomb friction. It can be seen that the ﬁnal displacement is more sensitive to
the friction variation compared to variations in the frequency. Robustness to the
frequency variation can be obtained with additional pulses which permits placing
additional zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter at the estimated pole locations which corre-
spond to the vibratory modes. The friction variation can be handled by successive
application of the proposed control proﬁle until the desired position is reached. Sta-

the friction coefﬁcient is overestimated, the residual energy increases at a rate greater

Summary
This chapter focused on the development of open-loop controllers for systems with
friction. As in the previous chapters, the two systems considered to illustrate the con-
trollers are a rigid body system and the ﬂoating oscillator benchmark problem which
includes one rigid body mode and one ﬂexible mode. The ﬁrst problem considered
is the design of time-optimal control proﬁles. A simple technique which eliminates
the frictional nonlinearity by integrating the friction force into a linearizing control
proﬁle is proposed. The resulting control proﬁle is not bang-bang, but it drives a lin-
ear system permitting the formulation of a parameter optimization problem for the
rest-to-rest maneuver of a linear system.

A pulse-width controller which is useful for small motions is also presented in
this chapter. A closed-form expression describing the relationship between the pulse
width and the displacement as a function of the coefﬁcient of friction is determined.
The effect of uncertainty on the stability of the repeated application of the pulse-
width controller is studied and bounds on the overestimation of the coefﬁcient of
friction is solved for which is useful for the analysis of the controlled system. To im-
prove the performance of the pulse-width controller, an estimator is included into the
control algorithm which results in reduction in the maneuver time compared to the
nonadaptive pulse-width controller. To account for constraints on the pulse width
which results from the sampling time, a pulse-width pulse-amplitude controller is
developed which in conjunction with the estimator results in improved performance.
The technique to design pulse-width pulse-amplitude controller for rigid-body sys-
tems is extended to control ﬂexible structures subject to friction and is illustrated on
the benchmark ﬂoating oscillator problem.

HIS chapter describes different techniques to solve for the parameters of input
shaper/time-delay ﬁlters (IS/TDF) and saturating controllers. Except for a very
small class of systems, closed form solutions for IS/TDF and saturating controllers
cannot be derived. One has to therefore resort to numerical techniques to determine
the optimal control proﬁles. This chapter describes three techniques to determine the
IS/TDF and saturating controllers. The ﬁrst entails parameterizing the control proﬁle
and solving for the optimal parameters via a gradient based constrained optimization
algorithm. The second technique exploits the strengths of linear programming in
conjunction with a bisection algorithm to determine the optimal IS/TDF and sat-
urating control proﬁles. The third exploits semideﬁnite optimization techniques to
optimize a linear cost subject to linear matrix inequalities (LMI). All three techniques
are illustrated on simple examples. MATLAB program listing which encode the two
algorithms are also provided. This chapter deals with input shaper/time-delay ﬁl-
ters, saturating controllers, minimax controllers that desensitize the control proﬁle to
modeling errors, and also presents results for benchmark examples.

where A1, A2, T1, and T2 are the parameters to be determined. The constraints on

sider a system with a pair of undamped poles at s =
 j. The following MATLAB
script is executed:
MATLAB Program 7.3:
x0 = [3 1 0 . 7 ] ;
poles = j ;
x = fmincon ( ’ cost ’ , x0 , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , ’ co n st ra i n t s ’ , [ ] , poles )
where x0 is the initial guess of the parameters to be optimized for. The vector x0
contains three terms corresponding to the parameters T, A1, and A2 of a single time-
delay ﬁlter. The variable poles is the listing of the poles to be canceled. Only one
of the pair of complex conjugate poles need to be listed. The MATLAB function for
constrained minimization is “fmincon.” The output of the optimizer is
x =
3.1416
0.5000
0.5000
which coincides with the solution given by Equations (2.14) and (2.17) which cor-
responds to the solution of the Posicast controller. If it is desired to desensitize the
IS/TDF to errors in estimated natural frequency, it has been shown that one needs to
place multiple zeros of the time-delay ﬁlter at the estimated location of the poles to
be canceled. This will requires additional delays in the ﬁlter transfer function. The
MATLAB script for this problem is:
MATLAB Program 7.4:
x0 = [3 6 0.3 0.7
0 . 4 ] ;
poles = [ j ; j ] ;
x = fmincon ( ’ cost ’ , x0 , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , ’ co n st ra i n t s ’ , [ ] , poles )
The output of the optimizer is
x =
3.1416
6.2832
0.2500
0.5000
0.2500
which is the same as the solution given by Equation (2.41) determined in Chapter 2.
This also corresponds to the ZVD input shaper by Singer and Seering [1].
Saturating controllers refer to control proﬁles where the control constraint is ac-
tive for all or part of the maneuver. Such control proﬁles correspond to time-optimal,
fuel-time optimal, fuel-constrained time-optimal control proﬁles besides others. Sat-
urating control proﬁles can be parameterized by switch times of the control pro-
ﬁles. For instance, the time-optimal solution for rest-to-rest maneuver of a double
integrator is a single switch bang-bang control proﬁle. The control proﬁle is thus,
parameterized in terms of the switch time and the maneuver time.

Analytic Gradients
Gradient-based optimizers require exact values or estimates of the gradient of the
cost with respect to the parameters being optimized for to calculate the updates of
the parameters. Often optimization software determine the gradients using ﬁnite
difference. However, if analytical gradients can be provided to the software, it will
expedite the convergence of the algorithm. In this section, the determination of the
analytic gradients for the control proﬁles which have been parameterized to generate
staircase proﬁles or bang-bang and bang-off-bang proﬁles is described.

MATLAB optimization functions “fmincon,” “fminimax” are gradient-based opti-
mization algorithms and as with any gradient-based algorithms, these often converge
to local optima. The initial guess strongly inﬂuences whether the gradient-based
optimization algorithm converges to the global optima. Computationally expensive
ﬁxes to the problem are available, e.g., Monte Carlo initial guesses, gridding initial
guesses, simulated annealing, and so forth. Posing a problem as a convex optimiza-
tion problem eliminate the problem of converging to a local optima. Linear program-
ming and semideﬁnite programming are two techniques which ensure convergenceto
a global optima. The next section presents a technique for the determination of opti-
mal control proﬁle using linear programming. This technique requires converting the
continuous-time problem to a discrete-time problem. As the sampling interval de-
creases, the solution of the discrete-time problem converges to the continuous-time
problem.

Linear Programming
A linear program is a problem which can be represented in the form:
minimize
cTz
(7.54a)
subject to
Aeqz
  beq
(7.54b)
Az
  b
(7.54c)
where z is the vector of parameters to be solved for. The simplex method for linear
programming that has been called one of the top 10 algorithms of the millennium by
the IEEE Computer Society [2], is a powerful algorithm that has been used exten-
sively to solve a variety of problems. Leonid Vitalyevich Kantorovich (who earned
his doctorate at the age of 18) and George Dantzig are considered the fathers of linear
programming (LP). In 1939, Kantorovich posed an LP problem to solve a problem
dealing with manufacturing schedules. Dantzig proposed the simplex algorithm for
solving a linear programming problem when working on a research project for the
U.S. Air Force, which related to coordinating supplies for troops in World War II.
Kantorovich was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1975 for his work
on optimal allocation of scarce resources.
Linear programming can be exploited in the design of controllers for linear sys-
tems. Consider the discrete-time state-space representation of a dynamical system
with a sampling time Ts:
x  k
 1    Gx k

Hu k
 where k
  1  2     N
(7.55)
where x is the state vector and u is the control input. The state response for the
control input u  k
  is
x  k
 1    Gkx1   k
∑
i 1
Gk  iHu  i (7.56)
where x 1   represents the initial state of the system. To solve control problems with
speciﬁed initial and ﬁnal states, in addition to the ﬁnal time (Tf ), the ﬁnal state con-
straint can be represented as
x N
 1    GNx1   N
∑
i 1
GN
 iHu  i (7.57)
where the maneuver time Tf
  N
1  Ts, i.e., the maneuver time is discretized into
N intervals. Equation 7.57 can be rewritten in the standard equality constraint form:

  u  k
   uub
(7.59)
where ulb and uub are the lower and upper bounds on the control, respectively, and
can be included in the problem formulation. Constraints on the states or combination
of states which have to be satisﬁed over the duration of the maneuver can be included
in the problem formulation. The state constraints can be represented as:
CGNx 1   N

∑
i 1
CGN
 iHu  i   0
 i
  0 N
 (7.60)
where C is the output matrix. Note that while states and inputs can be speciﬁed, con-
strained or treated as unconstrained variables within the linear program formulation
(Equation 7.54), this is not the case with the maneuver terminal time. TN must be
speciﬁed. This limits how minimum time control is to be managed, as described in
the next section.
7.2.1
Minimum Time Control
Since the linear programming approach requires the maneuver time to be spec-
iﬁed, the determination of the time-optimal controller using this approach requires
that an initial estimate of the maneuver time be used to determine whether it supports
a feasible solution. If it does not, the candidate optimal maneuver time is increased,
else it is iteratively decreased till the maneuver time cannot be reduced without vio-
lating the constraints. A MATLAB-based Bisection algorithm (Program 7.9) is used
to ﬁnd the lower bound for the feasible region of the maneuver time. This program
requires the name of a ﬁle which returns the exitﬂag which indicates whether the
linprog command resulted in a feasible solution. This program requires a lower (XL)
and upper (XU) bound of the maneuver time. One can select 0 for the lower bound
and a large time for the upper bound if one has no idea of the maneuver time. The
bracketing interval is halved every iteration and after N iterations, the optimal is
guaranteed to lie in the interval XU
 XL
2N
. In other words for a desired error tolerance
of ε, the algorithm requires
N
  log2
 XU
 XL
ε
 (7.61)
iterations irrespective of the function considered. The complexity of each iteration
however, is determined by the function.

Optimal Reference Shaping for Dynamical Systems: Theory and Applications
The minimum time formulation can be used to solve for the time-optimal control
proﬁles for systems with rigid-body modes which results in a bang-bang proﬁle for
Normal systems. It can also be used for the determination of input shaped reference
proﬁles for systems without rigid-body modes.
First, we will consider the problem of design of pre-ﬁltered reference proﬁle to
drive the system states to their ﬁnal values in ﬁnite time. Consider the undamped

be greater than zero results in the classic input-shaper solution, as shown in Fig-

To account for uncertainties in the plant model, a linear programming problem is
formulated where additional constraints which are a function of the sensitivity of the

The minimum fuel optimal control problem is solved for the undamped ﬂoating
oscillator problem where the maneuver time is assumed to be 6 seconds. The LP
problem results in a six-switch optimal control proﬁle which is antisymmetric about
the mid-maneuver time.

where α is a weighting parameter which speciﬁes the relative importance of the fuel
consumed to the maneuver time. This cost function is not conducive to the formula-
tion of an LP problem unlike the minimum fuel optimal controller. A technique sim-
ilar to the approach used to solve the minimum-time control problem is proposed.
Figure 7.8 illustrates the variation of the cost (Equation 7.83) as a function of the
maneuver time for α = 8 for the undamped ﬂoating oscillator benchmark problem.
It is clear from Figure 7.8 that the variation of the weighted fuel/time cost is a
multi-modal function of the maneuver time. A single-dimension search strategy such
as the golden section algorithm can be used to solve for the maneuver time which
corresponds to the minimum of the weighted fuel/time cost function. It should be
noted that the global minimum should be bracketed to preclude the possibility of the
algorithm converging to a local minima.

Figure 7.9 illustrates the two switch optimal control proﬁle and the corresponding

to that presented by Singh [3] where a parameter optimization problem is solved
to arrive at the fuel/time optimal control proﬁles for an undamped two-mass spring
system.

Minimax Control
Design of input shaped controllers which are insensitive to modeling uncertainties
has been posed in the framework of a minimax problem by Singh [4]. The residual
energy of the system over the domain of uncertainty is calculated and the maximum
magnitude is minimized. Since the residual energy is a quadratic function, it is not
compatible with the constraints of an LP problem.
In this section, we describe how a minimax problem can be solved using the LP
framework. Consider the problem

ing the uncertain domain of k into 21 models, the

is solved and the resulting control proﬁle and the system response for the nom-
inal model which corresponds to a stiffness of k = 1, are shown in Figure 7.11.
Figure 7.12(i) illustrates the variation of residual energy of the

the minimax ( Æ symbols) control proﬁles, respectively. It is clear that the minimax
solution has a smaller maximum magnitude of residual energy over the range of un-

faster than the determination of the minimax control proﬁle.

line corresponds to the value of the

seen that all the
  symbols lie within the square bounded by the dashed line.
Since the maneuver time is a user-selected variable, it is of interest to explore the
effect of variation of the maneuver time on the residual energy distribution and the
 ∞
norm. Three control proﬁles are derived for maneuver times of tf = 6.3405, 7.3405,
and 8.3405 seconds. Figure 7.13 illustrates the reduction in the maximum magnitude
of the residual energy over the range of uncertain k as a function of increasing ma-
neuver time. Since the input-shaped control proﬁle is not parameterized in terms of a
sequence of impulse sequences (input shaper) or the transfer function of a time-delay
ﬁlter, the ﬂexibility of the selection of the maneuver time in the LP formulation is
conducive to real-time implementation of the control proﬁles.
Figure 7.14 illustrates the reduction of the
 ∞norm as the maneuver time increases.
It can be seen that as the maneuver time varies, the components of the residual energy

Since it is clear that the insensitivity of the control proﬁle to errors in estimated
spring stiffness decreases with maneuver time, the proposed approach provides a
technique to trade-off robustness for reduced maneuver time. Figure 7.16 illustrates
the variation of the
 ∞norm which bounds the absolute magnitude of the residual
tracking error of all the uncertain models, as a function of the maneuver time. It can
be seen that there is a rapid reduction of the
 ∞norm until a maneuver time of about
9.5 seconds. A further increase in maneuver time does not signiﬁcantly reduce the
 ∞norm. This curve can be used by the control designer to trade-off maneuver time
for robustness.

Since the stiffness matrix is singular, the system states cannot be weighted by the
square root of the stiffness matrices. To account for this, a pseudo-spring stiffness
of 1 is attached to the ﬁrst mass so as to have 0 potential energy at the ﬁnal position.

where the Cholesky decomposition of the stiffness matrix is used to weigh the dis-
placement states. k
  corresponds to the stiffness of the pseudo-spring whose potential
energy is zero when the ﬁrst mass is at the desired ﬁnal state and is selected to be 1
for the following results.
Figure 7.17 illustrates the control proﬁle and the corresponding evolution of the
system states. The solid line represents the states of the mass to which the control
is applied and the dashed line represent the states of the noncollocated mass. The
control proﬁle for the
 ∞minimax controller is a ﬁve-switch bang-bang proﬁle which
has a structure identical to that designed to minimize the
 2 norm. The maneuver
time is selected to be 5.866, which is the maneuver time of the
 2 minimax optimal
controller.
Figure 7.18 illustrates the sensitivity of the residual energy as a function of varying
spring stiffness and the residual error states of the two mass for the entire set of
uncertain plants which are shown to lie in a box whose

 1 Optimal Control
Figure 7.19 illustrates the region whose boundaries corresponds to the
 1 norm
equal to f. For the two dimension case, the polygon is a cube rotated 45 degrees.
For the three-dimension case, the octahedron surfaces correspond to the
 1 norm
being a constant.
This section will focus on the design of control proﬁles which minimize the
 1
norm of the residual states over the span of uncertain models. To illustrate the for-
mulation of the necessary constraints, the two- and three-dimensional examples will
be exploited. Consider a system with two states X1 and X2 as shown in Figure 7.19(i),
the equations which constrain the
 1 norm to be less than f are:

It can be seen from the Equations (7.110) through (7.113) and (7.114) through (7.121),
that the coefﬁcients of the linear equations correspond to the vertices of a square and
cube, respectively, of edge length equal to
 2, centered at the origin. For exam-
ples, the vertices of a square centered at the origin with edge length
 2 are
 1  1  ,
 1  1 ,
 1  1 , and
 1  1  which are also the coefﬁcients of the linear con-
straint equations. Thus, the constraint equations for a system of order n can be de-
rived by determining the vertices of a n dimensional hypercube of edge length
 2,
and centered at the origin.
The minimax problem to design control proﬁles which minimize the
 1 norm of
the residual states over the domain of uncertain models can be stated in an LP form
as:

The
  symbols which represent the
 1 solution are bounded by the dashed line which
corresponds to the
 1 norm of 0.0229.
Since the LP approach to solving the minimax
 1 problem requires the maneuver
time to be speciﬁed, the effect of the maneuver time on the robustness can be stud-
ied. Figure 7.22 illustrates the sensitivity curves for maneuver times of tf = 6.3405,
7.3405, and 8.3405 seconds. As was evident in Example 7.3, an increase in the
maneuver time results in increased robustness of the controllers.
As in Example 7.3, the variation of the
 1 norm as a function of the maneuver
time is plotted in Figure 7.25. The
 ∞is plotted as well and it can be seen that the
trends are identical and the knee of both curves occur around a maneuver time of 9.5
seconds.

Discretizing the maneuver time into 1000 intervals, the LP problem is solved. Fig-
ure 7.26 illustrates the
 1 minimax control proﬁle and the evolution of the nominal
system states.
The solid line represents the states of the mass to which the control is applied and
the dashed line represents the states of the noncollocated mass. The control proﬁle
for the
 1 minimax controller is a ﬁve-switch bang-bang proﬁle which has a structure
that is identical to that designed to minimize the
 2 norm. The maneuver time is se-
lected to be 5.9093 which is the maneuver time of the
 2 minimax optimal controller.
Figure 7.27 illustrates the sensitivity plot of the
 1 and the
 2 minimax controllers.
The
 2 minimax controller is derived using a nonlinear programming approach and
its sensitivity is illustrated by the line with the
Æ marks. It can be seen that the

imax solution has a performance which is marginally better than that of the

 2 Optimal Control
In this section, an approach to use linear programming to solve the minimax prob-
lem that minimizes the residual energy of the system which is a
 2 norm is presented.
This involves approximating the n-dimensional hypersphere with (n–1)-dimensional
hyperplanes (simplex). A simplex is the convex hull of n
 1 points in n dimensional
space where the points do not all lie in some n
  1 dimensional subspace. For the
single dimension, the simplex is a line, for two dimension, it is a triangle, for the
third dimension it is a tetrahedeon, in the fourth dimension it is a pentatope, and so
on. Barycentric coordinates [5] which are also referred to homogeneous coordinates
or trilinear coordinates use n
 1 points to locate a point in n space relative to some
n dimensional simplex. Barycentric coordinates sum to unity. By requiring all the
coordinates to be positive constraints the points to lie in the simplex.
Figure 7.29 illustrates the approximation of an unit circle with lines and Fig-
ure 7.30 illustrates a unit sphere with multiple planes. Considering the three se-
quential approximation of the circle and sphere with lines and planes as Level 1, 2,
and 3, it is clear from Level 3, that the approximation of the
 2 norm by planes is
quite good.

Figure 7.31 illustrates the barycentric concept. The points Q and R on the line
connecting the points P1 and P2 are given by the barycentric coordinates
 0  5 0  5
 and
0  25 0  75
 , respectively. Similarly, the barycentric coordinates for the points
Q and R on the triangle formed by the points P1, P2, and P3 are given by the
three-tuples
1  3 1  3 1  3
 and
1  2 1  2 0
 , respectively.
The barycentric coordinates means for parameterizing speciﬁc points in an n-
simplex provides us a simple mechanism to recursively divide the n-simplex into
smaller segments. For example, if we start with two points specifying a line
P1
  1

and we are interested in dividing the line into four segments, we ﬁrst determine the

which corresponds to the constant

These points, which deﬁne patches are used to divide each patch into smaller
patches using the barycentric coordinate approach. These result in point which lie
on the plane deﬁned by the basic n-simplex. After the division of the n-simplex,
all the points are normalized to lie on an unit radius hypersphere. The patches after
normalization deﬁnes new planes which are inscribed within the unit radius hyper-
sphere. These planes now deﬁnes linear constraint equations which permit us to
approximately represent the spherical constraint with a set of linear constraints. To
illustrate this process, consider the plane deﬁned by the points P1, P2, and P3
in three-dimensional space. All possible combinations 3C2 of the points P1, P2,
and P3 are determined which are

which correspond to the barycentric coordinates

determined and are shown in Figure 7.32(i). Normalizing the points P4, P5, and
P6 results in points which lie on the sphere as shown in Figure 7.32(ii). The six
points deﬁne four planes which are deﬁned by the equations:

To determine the largest error in using hyperplanes to approximate hypersphere,
we need to calculate the shortest distance of every hyperplane from the origin and
the difference of this distance from unity is the error.

Having determined the coefﬁcients of the hyperplanes to approximate the hyper-

error is given as the difference from unity (the radius of the unit hypersphere) of the
shortest Euclidean distance of the plane from the origin. The point of intersection

Figure 7.34(i) illustrates the variations of the square root of the residual energy
as a function of the spring stiffness. The graph with the
  symbols corresponds to
the solution determined by the linear programming problem where eight lines are
used to approximate the circle which contains the residual states, and the graph with
the
Æ symbols corresponds to the solution derived form a nonlinear programming
problem (NLP). It can be seen that the difference between the solutions is minimal.
Figure 7.34(ii) illustrates the absolute magnitude of residual displacement plotted
versus the absolute magnitude of the velocity. The
 and the
Æ symbols corresponds
to the residual states for 51 models which span the range of uncertain stiffness for
the LP and NLP solutions. The dashed lines represent the lines that are used to
approximate the circle. It can be seen that all the
 symbols lie within the polygon
bounded by the dashed lines and the abscissa and the ordinate, and the
Æ symbols lie
in the region bounded by the arc of a circle and the x and y axes.

Figure 7.35 illustrates the results of the sensitivity curves and the norm of the

mate a circle. It can be seen that compared to Figure 7.34 the solutions are closer to
that of the NLP solution, but the incremental improvement might not warrant solving
a larger size LP problem.
Figure 7.36 illustrates the minimax control proﬁle generated using 8 and 16 lines
to approximate a circle, respectively. It can be noted that the solutions with an in-
creasing number of lines to approximate the circle, tends toward the two-switch min-

The 16
 1 = 1 planes are divided into 11 planes resulting in a total of 176 planes
to approximate the four-dimensional hypersphere. Each of these planes can be re-
cursively divided into 11 planes each for better approximation of the hypersphere.
In this example, we will stay with the 176 planes to approximate the hypersphere.
Using 21 points to discretize the uncertain spring stiffness space, results in an LP
problem with a total of 3696 inequality constraints. Dividing the time interval into
301 time instants, results in a total of 302 variables to be solved which correspond
to the magnitude of the control at 301 time instants and the variable which approx-
imates the radius of the hypersphere which bounds the residual energy of the 21
uncertain models.

gramming algorithms that can solve large-order systems. Recently, there has been
a tremendous growth in semideﬁnite programming which permit solving problems
that include linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Constraints that require the feasible
solution to lie within a hypersphere, which is deﬁned by a quadratic inequality equa-
tion, can be represented as an LMI. This permits posing the minimax problem in a
convex programming framework which guarantees convergence to a global optimal.

Linear Matrix Inequality
A linear matrix inequality can be described by the equation:
F
 x  F0
 x1F1
     xnFn
  0
(7.158)
where the symbol
  means negative deﬁnite. Fi are real symmetric matrices and
x
  x1 x2
    xn
 is a vector of real variables. LMIs are convex constraints, i.e., if
F
 x   0 and F

LMIs are important since numerous engineering problems can be posed as LMI
problems. To illustrate this, consider the linear dynamic system:
˙z

(7.160)
where z is the state vector and A is the system matrix. The system represented by
Equation (7.160) is asymptotically stable if:

(7.162)
which implies that the system is stable if a positive deﬁnite P can be determined
which satisﬁes Equation (7.161). Equations (7.161) and (7.162) constitute matrix-
valued LMIs which can be represented as a combined LMI:

has to be included in the linear programming problem.
Since the formulation does not include a hard constraint which requires satisfac-
tion of the boundary conditions, the numerical solution corresponds to one which
minimizes γ. Figure 7.40 illustrates the variation of γ as a function of the maneuver
time tf .
Thus, one can use the bisection algorithm to determine the maneuver time which
corresponds to the smallest time for which γ is less than some prespeciﬁed tolerance.
Figure 7.41 illustrates the solution determined using the LMI formulation and a bi-
section algorithm to determine the minimum time for a rest-to-rest maneuver for a
single spring-mass-dashpot system.

The LMI formulation for the design of time-delay ﬁlters to minimize residual
vibrations of a rest-to-rest maneuver can be extended to design robust time-delay
ﬁlters. Given a domain of uncertainty of the model parameters, a set of models (M )
are derived by sampling the uncertain space. The errors in terminal states for each
of these models is determined and the maximum of the norm of the terminal state
errors is minimized. The minimax problem can be stated as:

Modal Weighted Minimax Time-Delay Filters
The minimax time-delay ﬁlter design presented in the previous section minimized
the maximum magnitude of the residual energy in the system, over the domain of
uncertain parameters. As compared to traditional robust input shapers where the
sensitivity of the residual energy at the nominal model parameters is minimized, the
minimax approach resulted in a smaller value of the worst performance over the
domain of uncertainty.

Is minimizing the worst residual energy of the system the best metric to be used in
the design of robust time-delay ﬁlter, or can one conceive of a different metric which
generate an input shaped proﬁle which targets the output of interest? To motivate
this, consider the three mass-spring system shown in Figure 7.43. The three modes
of this system

are shown in the same ﬁgure. The frequencies corresponding to the three modes are:

which clearly indicates that the second mode’s contribution is the largest and the third
mode’s is the smallest. These modal contributions can be used to relatively weigh
the modal energies to formulate a cost function whose maximum can be minimized
over the uncertain domain.
Consider a second-order linear mechanical system of the form

where the mass matrix M is positive deﬁnite, C is a positive semideﬁnite damping

For controlling the output with high precision, e.g., if the displacement of the ﬁnal

If one is interested in displacement precision, the residual energy of each of the mode
is ﬁrst weighted so as to correspond to the same ﬁnal displacement. For instance, if
the displacement of the ﬁrst two modes are the same, we have the constraint:
y1
  y2
(7.216)
which can be rewritten in terms of potential energies as:
1
2ω2
1y2
1
  1
2ω2
2y2
2
 ω2
1
ω2
2
 (7.217)
which states that the potential energy of the second mode has to be scaled by ω2
1
ω2
2
to satisfy the displacement precision constraint. Furthermore, since the output is a
linear combination of the modal displacements, each of the modes has to be rescaled
to reﬂect the modal contribution of every mode. For a system with an output equation
in modal form:
y
 n
∑

(7.218)
the cost function for optimization can be written as:

(7.219)
where yf

be posed to minimize the maximum magnitude of the weighted residual energy given
by Equation (7.219).

coefﬁcient of friction is c = 1.0 N/(m/s). To control the position of the trolley (Fig-

gain of 1 was used. Robust pre-ﬁlters for shaping the position reference when there
is uncertainty in the mass of payload, m2 were designed using the aforementioned
methodology. The system needs to be repositioned from the initial state of

The ﬁnal time for both the solutions is 9.46 seconds. To permit a fair comparison
of both the solutions, the true residual energy of the double pendulum at 9.46 sec-
onds is determined and plotted as a function of the uncertain mass m2. Figure 7.46(i)
illustrates that the maximum magnitude of the residual energy of the system con-
trolled by an input proﬁle designed by minimizing the cost function J1 (total residual
energy) is smaller than that designed based on the modal weighted residual energy,
which is not a surprising result. However, if one were to plot the ﬁnal mass residual
energy metric deﬁned as:

as shown in Figure 7.46(ii), the control proﬁle based on minimizing the cost function
J2 clearly outperforms the one based on minimizing the cost function J1. In all these
graphs, the dashed line corresponds to the solution when minimizing J1 and the solid
line when minimizing J2.

The improved performance of using the cost function J2 to design a shaped proﬁle
can be gauged from Figures 7.47 and 7.48, which illustrate the motion of the mass
m2 relative to the trolley after the ﬁnal time tf
  9  46 seconds, for various values of
the uncertain mass m2. The mesh plot in Figure 7.47 has a larger variation about the
zeros position compared to the variation illustrated in Figure 7.48.
One has to note that the modal weighted approach can encounter a pathologic
problem when one or more modes might have no contribution to the output of inter-
est. For instance, in the three-mass-spring system illustrated earlier, if the output of
interest is the second mass, then the second mode does not contribute to the output. In
such situations, the noncontributing modes are not included in the cost function and
the resulting shaped reference proﬁle does not regulate the noncontributing modes.
One can remedy this situation by including the noncontributing modes with a small
weight in the cost function.

terizations can be used to represent the optimal control proﬁle such as using switch
times to parameterize bang-bang controllers for minimum-time control, a nonlinear
parameter optimization can be formulated and any gradient based algorithm can be
used to arrive at the optimal solution. A caveat that should always be stated regarding
the convergence of gradient based algorithms to local optima.

ensure convergence to global optima since they apply to convex problems. Optimal
controller design can be posed in discrete-time domain which permits exploitation
of convex programming approaches to arrive at the near-globally-optimal solutions.
The sampling time selected to discretize the control proﬁle inﬂuences the quality of
the solution. Smaller the sampling time, closer is the solution to the true optimal so-
lution. If the exact optimal solution is desired, the results of the convex optimization
approach can be used to identify the structures of the optimal control proﬁle. For ex-
ample, the linear programming approach used to determine the time-optimal solution
provides the structure of the control proﬁle with the correct number of switches and
accurate estimates for their values. The estimate of the number of switches and their
values permit posing a nonlinear programming problem which will often converge
to the globally optimal solution given that the initial guess is close to the optimal
solution. Linear programming and linear matrix inequalities are used to illustrate
design of various controller which include control and state constraints. Inclusion
of sensitivity states and minimax formulation permit design of robust controllers for
rest-to-rest maneuvers.
