Preface
The very small and the very large are intimately connected in Nature. Particle
physics and astrophysics meet in fundamental questions: the structure and
evolution of stars; their end and how this is manifested; how we think galaxies
are created from matter we have yet to discover and why we believe the most
energetic particles cannot come from the most distant universe.
During the IV Escuela Mexicana de Astrof´ısica (EMA-2005), held in the
beautiful colonial city of Morelia between 18 and 23 July 2005, we reviewed
and explored the numerous connections between astrophysics and particle
physics. The core of the school program, aimed to advanced postgraduated
students and young researchers in physics and astrophysics, was formed by
half a dozen extended lecture courses delivered by recognized experts in their
ﬁelds. The written versions of these courses became the main substance of this
book. Three review talks were devoted to the techniques and results of novel
astronomical windows of the XX and XXI centuries: radioastronomy, gamma-
ray astronomy and gravitational wave astronomy. This volume includes also
six short contributions, presented as single talks during the EMA-2005, ex-
amples of experimental and theoretical research work presently conducted in
M´exico and Latin-America.
This book is the ﬁnal product of a two year process centered on the EMA-
2005. We believe it will serve as a guide not just to the participants but also
to the communities of all interrelated ﬁelds.

Nuclear Astrophysics: Evolution of Stars from
Hydrogen Burning to Supernova Explosion

1 Introduction
Nuclear astrophysics has developed in the last twenty years into one of the
most important subﬁelds of ‘applied’ nuclear physics. It is a truly interdisci-
plinary ﬁeld, concentrating on primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis, stellar
evolution, and the interpretation of cataclysmic stellar events like novae and
supernovae.
The ﬁeld has been tremendously stimulated by recent developments in
laboratory and observational techniques. In the laboratory the development
of radioactive ion beam facilities as well as low-energy underground facilities
have allowed to remove some of the most crucial ambiguities in nuclear as-
trophysics arising from nuclear physics input parameters. This work has been
accompanied by signiﬁcant progress in nuclear theory which makes it now
possible to derive some of the input at stellar conditions based on microscopic
models. Nevertheless, much of the required nuclear input is still insuﬃciently
known. Here, decisive progress is expected once radioactive ion beam facili-
ties of the next generation, like the one at GSI, are operational. The nuclear
progress goes hand-in-hand with tremendous advances in observational data
arising from satellite observations of intense galactic gamma-sources, from ob-
servation and analysis of isotopic and elemental abundances in deep convective
Red Giant and Asymptotic Giant Branch stars, and abundance and dynam-
ical studies of nova ejecta and supernova remnants. Recent breakthroughs
have also been obtained for measuring the solar neutrino ﬂux, giving clear
evidence for neutrino oscillations and conﬁrming the solar models. Also, the
latest developments in modeling stars, novae, x-ray bursts, type I supernovae,
and the identiﬁcation of the neutrino wind driven shock in type II supernovae
as a possible site for the r-process allow now much better predictions from
nucleosynthesis calculations to be compared with the observational data.

It is impossible to present all these exciting developments in a set of four
hour-long lectures. We will rather focus on a classical aspect, the evolution
of massive stars in hydrostatic equilibrium from the initial hydrogen burning
phase up to their cataclysmic ﬁnal fate as a core-collapse supernova. This
means, however, that other important aspects of nuclear astrophysics have
to be omitted. These include evolution of binary systems and their related
nucleosynthesis (novae, x-ray bursters, type Ia supernovae), nucleosynthesis
beyond iron (s-process, r-process, p-process) or big-bang nucleosynthesis. For
the interested reader I will at least point to some excellent recent reviews
which discuss aspects of nuclear astrophysics. We mention here a few:

2 The Nuclear Physics Input
2.1 Rate Equations and Reaction Rates
Nuclear reactions play an essential role in the evolution of a star and in many
other astrophysical scenarios. Obviously, they change the chemical composi-
tion of the environment in a manner that can be described by a set of rate
equations,

δt =

where Yi is the relative abundance, by number, of the nuclide i. Alternatively,
the rate equation can be expressed in terms of the mass fraction Xi of a
nuclide, which is related to the relative abundance via Xi = AiYi, where Ai
is the number of nucleons in the nuclide i. For a complete description of the
astrophysical scenarios with which we are concerned in the chapter, the rate
equations have to be supplemented by equations that, in the case of a star,
describe energy and momentum conservation, energy transport, the state of
matter, etc., or in the early universe, the time evolution of the temperature.
The coeﬃcients C in Eq. (1) are the rate constants. In the case of the
destruction of the nuclide j, as in photodissociation (γ+j →i+y), the nuclide
i will be generated and the coeﬃcient Ci
j is positive. Similarly, the nuclide i
can either be generated (e−+ j →i + ν) or destroyed (e−+ i →j′ + ν)
by electron capture. Correspondingly, the coeﬃcients Ci
j would be positive or
negative. In two-body reactions, the nuclide i can be produced (j +k →i+...)
or destroyed (i + j →k + ...). The (positive) rate coeﬃcients are then given
by
Ci

Rjk =
ρ
mu
⟨σv⟩jk
Ck
ij = ρ(1 + δij)
NiNjmu
Rij =
ρ
mu
⟨σv⟩ij
(2)
where ρ is the (local) mass density, mu = 931.502 MeV is the atomic mass
unit, and Ni is the number density of nuclide i. To derive an expression for
the nuclear reaction rates Rij, consider a process in which a projectile nucleus
X reacts with a target nucleus Y (X + Y →...). The cross section for this
reaction depends on the relative velocity v of the two nuclei and is given by
σ(v). The number densities of the two species in the environment are Nx and
Ny. Then, the nuclear reaction rate Rxy is simply the product of the eﬀective
reaction area (σ(v)·Ny) spanned by the target nuclei and the ﬂux of projectile
nuclei (Nx · v). Thus
Rxy =
1
1 + δxy
NxNy⟨σ(v)v⟩
(3)
where we have taken account of the distribution of velocities of target and
projectile nuclei in the astrophysical environment. Thus, the product σ(v)v
has to be averaged over the distribution of target and projectile velocities, as
indicated by the ⟨⟩brackets in Eq. (3). The Kronecker-symbol avoids double-
counting for identical projectile and target nuclei. Sometimes, three-body re-
actions, like the fusion of 3α-particles to 12C (see Section 3), play a role in the
nuclear network requiring the rate equations (1) to be modiﬁed appropriately.
In all applications with which we are concerned below, the velocity dis-
tribution of the nuclei is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
characterized by some temperature T. Then one has (E = µ
2 v2) [1]

2.2 Neutron-Induced Reactions
The interstellar medium (ISM) from which a star forms by gravitational con-
densation contains only (Z ≥1) nuclei. Because the neutron half-life is about
10 minutes, which is short on most astrophysical time scales, the ISM does
not contain free neutrons. However, neutrons are produced in stellar evolution
stages by (α, n) reactions like 13C(α, n)16O and 22Ne(α, n)25Mg (Section 3).
These neutrons thermalize very quickly in a star and can therefore also be
described by Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions.
At low energies, nonresonant neutron-induced reactions are dominated by
s-wave capture and the cross section σn approximately follows a 1/v law [2].
Thus, ⟨σnv⟩≈constant. At somewhat higher energies, partial waves with
l > 0 may contribute. To account for these contributions, the product σnv
may conveniently be expanded in a MacLaurin series in powers of E1/2,
σnv = S(0) + ˙S(0)E1/2 + 1

resulting in

where the parameters S(0), ˙S(0), ¨S(0) (the dots indicate derivatives with
respect to E1/2) have to be determined from experiment (or theory).
2.3 Nonresonant Charged-Particle Reactions
During the hydrostatic burning stages of a star, charged-particle reactions
most frequently occur at energies far below the Coulomb barrier, and are
possible only via the tunnel eﬀect, the quantum mechanical possibility of pen-
etrating through a barrier at a classically forbidden energy. At these low en-
ergies, the cross section σ(E) is dominated by the penetration factor,
P(E) = | ψ(Rn) |2
| ψ(Rc) |2

radii, Rn (several fermis), and at the classical turning point Rc. By solving the
Schr¨odinger equation for s-wave (l = 0) particles interacting via the Coulomb
potential of two point-like charges

one obtains [3]

(13)
where the energy E is deﬁned in keV.
For the following discussion it is convenient and customary to redeﬁne the
cross section in terms of the astrophysical S-factor by factoring out the known
energy dependences of the penetration factor (12) and the de Broglie factor,
in the model-independent way,
S(E) = σ(E)(E) exp [2πη(E)]
(14)
For low-energy, nonresonant reactions, the astrophysical S-factor should have
only a weak energy dependence that reﬂects eﬀects arising from the strong
interaction, as from antisymmetrization, and from small contributions from
partial waves with l > 0 and for the ﬁnite size of the nuclei. The valid-
ity of this approach has been justiﬁed in numerous (nonresonant) nuclear
reactions for which the experimentally determined S-factors show only weak
E-dependences at low energies. For heavier nuclei, the S-factor becomes some-
what more energy-dependent because of the ﬁnite-size eﬀects, especially as E
is increased.

T6 measures the temperature in units of 106 K.
Examples of E0, ∆and Imax, evaluated for some nuclear reactions at the
solar core temperature (T6 ≈15.6), are summarized in Table 1.
We conclude from Table 1 that the reactions operate in relatively narrow
energy windows around the astrophysically most eﬀective energy E0. Further-
more, it becomes clear from inspecting the diﬀerent Imax values that reactions
of nuclei with larger charge numbers eﬀectively cannot occur in the sun as,
for these reactions, even the solar core is far too cold.
However, it usually turns out that the astrophysically most eﬀective en-
ergy E0 is smaller than the energies at which the reaction cross section can
be measured directly in the laboratory. Thus for astrophysical applications,
an extrapolation of the measured cross section to stellar energies is usually
necessary, often over many orders of magnitude.
In the case of nonresonant reactions, the extrapolation can be safely per-
formed in terms of the astrophysical S-factor, because of its rather weak en-
ergy dependence. One can then expand the S-factor in terms of a MacLaurin
expansion in powers of E,
S(E) = S(0) + S(0)E + 1

2.4 Resonant Reactions of Charged Particles
For resonant reactions, the assumption of an astrophysical S-factor that is only
weakly dependent on energy is no longer valid. In fact, the cross section shows
a strong variation over the energy range of the resonance that can usually be
approximated by a Breit-Wigner single-resonance formula,
σBW(E) = πλ2ω
ΓaΓb
(E −ER)2 + Γ 2/4
(24)

10
K. Langanke
where the Γi are the partial widths that deﬁne the decay (or formation) proba-
bilities of the resonance in the channels i. (A nuclear resonance can in principle
decay into all possible partitions of the nucleons that are allowed by the var-
ious conservation laws, e.g. energy, angular momentum, etc. Such a partition
of nucleons is often called a channel. As an example, a resonance just above
the 6Li + p threshold can decay only into the 6Li + p, 3He + 4He and 7Be
+ γ “channels.”) The total width Γ is the sum of the partial widths. The
statistical factor ω is given by
ω =
(2J + 1)
(2JP + 1)(2JT + 1)(1 + δP T )
(25)
where J is the total angular momentum of the resonance, while JP , JT are
the spins of the projectile and target nuclei, respectively.
For further discussion, it is convenient to distinguish between narrow and
broad resonances. By a narrow resonance we will understand a resonance for
which the total width is much smaller than its resonance energy ER, Γ ≪ER.
Then one can assume that the Maxwell-Boltzmann function and the E-factor
in the integral (4) are nearly constant over the energy range of the resonance
and obtain

where the product ωΓaΓb/Γ is often called the “resonance strength”. If possi-
ble, the parameters Γa, Γb, Γ, J and ER should be determined experimentally
by using either direct or indirect techniques. Note that the reaction rate de-
pends sensitively on the resonance energy ER because of its appearance in an
exponent.
For broad resonances (Γ ∼ER), the cross section is still given by a Breit-
Wigner formula (24). However, now one has to remember that the partial
width corresponding to the entrance channel, Γa, and possibly also the par-
tial widths of the outgoing channels may be strongly energy dependent over
the energy range of the resonance. Because this energy dependence stems
mainly from the E dependence of the probability of penetration through the
Coulomb barrier, one can approximate Γ(E) for charged-particle reactions by
the expression
Γ(E) = Pl(E, Rn)
Pl(ER, Rn) × Γ(ER)
(27)

Nuclear Astrophysics
11
where Γ(ER) is the width at the resonance energy. The penetration factors in
the partial wave l can be expressed in terms of regular and irregular Coulomb
functions [9]
Pl(E, Rn) =
1
F 2
l (kRn) + G2
l (kRn)
(28)
where k is the wave number. Even for radiative capture reactions, the energy
dependence of the width in the exit channel has to be considered. Here one
ﬁnds
Γγ(E) =
 E −Ef
ER −Ef
2L+1
Γγ(ER)
(29)
where L is the multipolarity of the electromagnetic transition, Ef is the energy
of the ﬁnal state in the transition, and Γγ(ER) is the radiative width at the
resonance energy. For a reliable description of broad-resonance contributions
to the nuclear reaction rate, quantities like Γ(ER) in Eq. (27) and Γγ(ER),
L, and Ef in Eq. (29) should be determined experimentally.
The evaluation of ⟨σv⟩may be simpliﬁed by the fact that broad resonances
frequently occur at energies ER that are large compared with the most eﬀec-
tive energy E0. Thus, at astrophysical energies, only the slowly-varying tail
of the resonance contributes. This tail can usually be expanded adequately in
terms of a MacLaurin series for the resulting S-factor (20), so that the formal-
ism developed for nonresonant reactions in Section 2.3 can then be applied to
describe the reaction rates for broad resonances when ER is far above E0.
2.5 The General Case
In the most general situation the astrophysical S-factor might have contribu-
tions, in the relevant energy range near E0, arising from narrow resonances,
the low-energy tails of higher-energy, broad resonances, nonresonant reaction,
and the high-energy tails of subthreshold states [for an important example, see
the discussion of the 12C(α, γ)16O reaction in Section 3]. For a subthreshold
resonance, the cross section may also be described by a Breit-Wigner formula
above the threshold. The energy dependences of the widths have to be taken
into account, of course. While an analytical expression exists for the evolution
of ⟨σv⟩for subthreshold resonances, the resulting integral in Eq. (15) is most
simply calculated numerically.
Note that the contributions arising from the various sources listed above
can interfere if they have the same J-value and parity. In many cases, the
interference terms in the cross sections are the most important part of the
extrapolation procedure. However, even the experimental determination of
the sign of the interference term is sometimes not possible, and it is then only
possible to put upper and lower limits on the extrapolated astrophysical cross
sections.

For astrophysically important reactions, a series of regularly updated com-
pilations gives conveniently parameterized presentations of the reaction rates
as functions of temperature [4, 6, 7, 8, 10]. For a much more detailed dis-
cussion of the topics presented in this section, the reader is referred to the
excellent textbook by Rolfs and Rodney [1] and references listed therein.
2.6 Plasma Screening
Up to now we have evaluated the reaction rates for the case of bare nuclei, in
which the repulsive Coulomb barrier extends to inﬁnity. In the astrophysical
environment with which we are concerned here, the nuclei are surrounded
by other nuclei and free electrons (“plasma”). The electrons tend to cluster
around the nuclei, partially shielding the nuclear charges from one another.
Consequently, in a plasma, two colliding nuclei have to penetrate an eﬀective
barrier that, at a given energy, is thinner than for two bare nuclei. As a result,
nuclear reactions proceed faster in a plasma than would be deduced from the
cross section for bare nuclei. This relation is usually deﬁned by introducing
an enhancement factor f(E) [11]:
⟨σv⟩plasma = f(E)⟨σv⟩bare nuclei
(30)
where ⟨σv⟩bare nuclei corresponds to the expressions derived in Sections 2.3 and
2.4.
In the plasmas of the stellar hydrostatic burning stages the average kinetic
energy kT is much larger than the average Coulomb energy between the con-
stituents Ecou. In this “weak screening limit” (Ecou ≪kT), the Debye-H¨uckel
theory is applicable and the Coulomb potential can be replaced by an eﬀective
shielded potential [11]:
Veﬀ(R) = Z1Z2e2
R
e−R/RD
(31)
where the Debye radius RD is a characteristic parameter of the plasma with
RD =

and
ζ =

(Z2
i + Zi)Xi
Ai
(33)
The sum in Eq. (33) runs over all diﬀerent constituents of the plasma. As an
example, RD = 0.218 ˚A in the solar core.
During the barrier penetration process, the separation of the two colliding
nuclei is usually much smaller than the Debye radius (R ≪RD); accordingly,
Veﬀ(R) can be conveniently expanded as

indicating that the eﬀect of the plasma on the nuclear collision is approxi-
mately equivalent to providing a constant energy increment for the colliding
particles of Ue. With Eqs. (4) and (34) it is simple to derive an expression for
the enhancement factor f(E):

Applying the Debye-H¨uckel approach to the solar core (with RD = 0.218 ˚A,
kT = 1.3 keV), one ﬁnds that the plasma enhances reactions like 3He(3He,
2p)4He and 7Be(p, γ)8 by about 20%. We note that stellar and in particular
solar models use screening descriptions which go beyond the simple Debye-
H¨uckel treatment.
2.7 Electron Screening in Laboratory Nuclear Reactions
Electron screening eﬀects also become important at the lowest energies cur-
rently feasible in laboratory measurements of light nuclear reactions [12]. Here,
the electrons inevitably present in the target (and sometimes also bound to
the projectile) partly shield the Coulomb barrier of the bare nuclei. Conse-
quently, the measured cross section is larger than that of bare nuclei would be.
Again, this can be expressed by introducing an enhancement factor deﬁned
as
Smeas(E) = flab(E)S(E)bare nuclei
(36)
Note that the enhancement factor flab is not the same as deﬁned in Eq.
(30) as the physics behind the screening is quite diﬀerent. In the plasma, the
electrons are in continuum states, while the target electrons are bound to the
nuclei. Thus, for astrophysical applications, it is important to deduce ﬁrst
the cross sections for bare nuclei from the measured data, by using a relation
like Eq. (36). Then, in a second step, the resulting reaction rates have to be

14
K. Langanke
modiﬁed for plasma screening eﬀects, e.g. using Eq. (35). It is also important
to recognize that the general strategy in nuclear astrophysics of reducing the
uncertainty in the cross section at the most eﬀective energy E0, by extending
the measurements to increasingly lower energies, introduces a new risk, as it
requires a precise knowledge of the enhancement factor flab(E). At this time,
there is a signiﬁcant, unexplained discrepancy between the experimentally
extracted enhancement factors and the current theoretical predictions.
The 3He(d, p)4He reaction is probably the best studied example of labo-
ratory electron screening eﬀects, both experimentally and theoretically. As in
the plasma case, the nuclear separation during the penetration process (R <∼
0.02 ˚A at E = 6 keV) is far inside the electron cloud of the atomic 3He target,
and the calculated screening eﬀect of the electrons in the nuclear collision is
to eﬀectively provide a constant energy increase ∆E [12]. As ∆E ≪E, one

(37)
At very low energies, the collision can be described in the adiabatic limit
where the electrons remain in the lowest state of the combined projectile and
target molecular system. It has been argued [12] that the adiabatic limit can
already be applied at the lower energies at which 3He(d, p)4He data have
been taken. This assumption was in fact approximately justiﬁed in a study of
this reaction in which the electron wave functions were treated dynamically
within the TDHF approach [13]. In the adiabatic limit, ∆E = 119 eV for
the d+3He system, which corresponds to the diﬀerence in atomic binding
energies between atomic He and the Li+-ion. Using this value in Eq. (37),
one underestimates the enhancement shown by the experimental data, which
suggests Ue ∼220 eV [14].
3 Hydrostatic Burning Stages
When the temperature and density in a star’s interior rises as a result of grav-
itational contraction, it will be the lightest (lowest Z) species (protons) that
can react ﬁrst and supply the energy and pressure to stop the gravitational
collapse of the gaseous cloud. Thus it is hydrogen burning (the fusion of four
protons into a 4He nucleus) in the stellar core that stabilizes the star ﬁrst (and
for the longest) time. However, because of the larger charge (Z = 2), helium,
the ashes of hydrogen burning, cannot eﬀectively react at the temperature and
pressure present during hydrogen burning in the stellar core. After exhaustion
of the core hydrogen, the resulting helium core will gravitationally contract,

Nuclear Astrophysics
15
thereby raising the temperature and density in the core until the temperature
and density are suﬃcient to ignite helium burning, starting with the triple-
alpha reaction, the fusion of three 4He nuclei to 12C. In massive stars, this
sequence of contraction of the core nuclear ashes until ignition of these nuclei
in the next burning stage repeats itself several times. After helium burning,
the massive star goes through periods of carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon
burning in its central core. As the binding energy per nucleon is a maximum
near iron (the end-product of silicon burning), freeing nucleons from nuclei
in and above the iron peak, to build still heavier nuclei, requires more en-
ergy than is released when these nucleons are captured by the nuclei present.
Therefore, the procession of nuclear burning stages ceases. This results in a
collapse of the stellar core and an explosion of the star as a type II supernova.
As an example, Table 2 shows the timescales and conditions for the various
hydrostatic burning stages of a 25 M⊙star. One observes that stars spend
most of their lifetime (∼90%) during hydrogen burning (then the stars will
be found on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram). The rest
is basically spent during core helium burning. During this evolutionary stage,
the star expands dramatically and becomes a Red Giant.

Stellar evolution depends very strongly on the mass of the star. On general
grounds, the more massive a star the higher the temperatures in the core
at which the various burning stages are ignited. Moreover, as the nuclear
reactions depend very sensitively on temperature, the nuclear fuel is faster
exhausted the larger the mass of the star (or the core temperature). This is
quantitatively demonstrated in Table 3 which shows the timescales for core
hydrogen burning as a function of the main-sequence of the star. One observes
that stars with masses less than ∼0.5M⊙burn hydrogen for times which are
signiﬁcantly longer than the age of the Universe. Thus such low-mass stars
have not completed one lifecycle and did also not contribute to the elemental

16
K. Langanke
abundances in the Universe. A star like our Sun has a life-expectation due to
core hydrogen burning of about 1010 y, which is about double its current age
(∼4.55 × 109 y).
As the temperatures and densities required for the higher burning stages
increase successively, stars need a minimum mass to ignite such burning
phases. For example, a core mass slightly larger than 1M⊙is required to
ignite carbon burning. One also has to consider that stars, mainly during core
helium burning, have mass losses due to ﬂashes or stellar winds. In summary,
as a rule-of-thumb, stars with main-sequence masses ≤8M⊙end their lifes as
White Dwarfs. These are stars which are dense enough so that their electrons
are highly degenerate and are stabilized by the electron degeneracy pressure.
There exists an upper limit for the mass of a star which can be stabilized by
electron degeneracy. This is the Chandrasekhar mass of ∼1.4M⊙. Stars with
masses of ≥13M⊙go through the full cycle of hydrostatic burning stages
and end with a collapse of their internal iron core. If the mass of the star is
less than a certain limit, M ∼30M⊙, the star becomes a supernova leaving
a compact remnant behind after the explosion; this is a neutron star. More
massive stars might collapse directly into black holes.

3.1 Hydrogen Burning
In low-mass stars, like our Sun, hydrogen burning proceeds mainly via the pp
chains, with small contributions from the CNO cycle. The later becomes the
dominant energy source in hydrogen-burning stars, if the temperature in the
stellar core exceeds about 20 million degrees (the temperature in the solar
core is 15.6 106 K).

Nuclear Astrophysics
17
The pp chains start with the fusion of two proton nuclei to the only bound
state of the two-nucleon system, the deuteron. This reaction is mediated by the
weak interaction, as a proton has to be converted into a neutron. Correspond-
ingly, the cross section for this reaction is very small and no experimental data
at low proton energies exist. Although the reaction rate at solar energies is
based purely on theory, the calculations are generally considered to be under
control and the uncertainty of the solar p+p rate is estimated to be better
than a few percent [16]. The next reaction (p + d →3He) is mediated by the
electromagnetic interaction. It is therefore much faster than the p+p fusion
with the consequence that deuterons in the solar core are immediately trans-
formed to 3He nuclides and no signiﬁcant abundance of deuterons is present
in the core (there is about 1 deuteron per 1018 protons in equilibrium under
solar core conditions). As no deuterons are available and 4Li (the endproduct
of p+3He) is not stable, the reaction chain has to continue with the fusion
of two 3He nuclei via 3He+3He→2p+4He. This reaction terminates the ppI
chain where in summary four protons are fused to one 4He nucleus with an
energy gain of 26.2 MeV; the rest of the mass diﬀerence is spent to produce
two positrons and is radiated away by the neutrinos produced in the initial
p+p fusion reaction. Once 4He is produced in suﬃcient abundance, the pp
chain can be completed by two other routes. At ﬁrst 3He and 4He fuse to
7Be which then either captures a proton (producing 8B) or, more likely, an
electron (producing 7Li). The two chains are then terminated by the weak
decay of 8B to an excited state in 8Be, which subsequently decays into two
4He nuclei, and by the 7Li(p,4He)4He reaction. In summary, both routes fuse
4 protons into one 4He nucleus. The energy gain of these two branches of the
pp chains is slightly smaller than in the dominating ppI chain, as neutrinos
with somewhat larger energies are produced en route [17].
All of the pp chain reactions are non-resonant at low energies such that the
extrapolation of data taken in the laboratory to stellar (solar) energies is quite
reliable [16]. For two reactions (3He+3He→4He+2p and p+d →3He) the cross
sections have been measured at the solar Gamow energies, thus making ex-
trapolations of data unnecessary (see Fig. 1). These important measurements
have been performed by the LUNA group at the Gran Sasso Laboratory [18]
far underground to eﬀectively remove background events due to the shielding
by the rocks above the experimental hall. For many years the p+7Be fusion
reaction has been considered the most uncertain nuclear cross sections in solar
models. However, impressive progress has been achieved in determining this
reaction rate in recent years and it appears that the goal of knowing the solar
reaction rate for this reaction better than the limit of 5%, as desired for solar
models, has been reached [19].
Also in the CNO cycle four protons are fused to one 4He nucleus. However,
this reaction chain requires the presence of 12C as catalyst. It then proceeds
through the following sequence of reactions:
12C(p,γ)13N(β)13C(p,γ)14N(p,γ)15O(β)15N(p,α)12C.

Fig. 1. S-factors for the low-energy 3He+3He and d + p fusion reactions. The data
have been taken at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory by the LUNA collab-
oration. For the ﬁrst time, it has been possible to measure nuclear cross sections at
the astrophysically most eﬀective energies covering the regime of the Gamow peak.
The 3He+3He data include electron screening eﬀects which have been removed to
obtain the cross section for bare nuclei.
The slowest step is the p+14N reaction. There has been decisive experi-
mental progress in determining this reaction rate in the last two years by the
LUNA and LENA collaborations which both showed that the reaction rate is
actually smaller by a factor 2 than previously believed [20, 21]. As a conse-
quence the CNO cycle contributes less than 1% of the total energy generation
in the Sun. The new p+14N reaction rate has also interesting consequences
for the age determination of globular clusters [22].
For many years the solar neutrino problem has been one of the outstanding
puzzles in astrophysics [17]. It states that the ﬂux of solar neutrinos measured
by earthbound detectors was noticeably less than predicted by the solar mod-
els. The solution to the problem are neutrino oscillations. Within the solar
pp chains only νe neutrinos are produced. Enhanced by matter eﬀects some
of these neutrinos are transformed into νµ or ντ neutrinos on their way out
of the Sun. As the original solar neutrino detectors can only observe νe neu-
trinos, the observed neutrino ﬂux in these detectors is smaller than the total
neutrino ﬂux generated in the Sun. This picture was conﬁrmed by the SNO
collaboration in the last two years [23]. The SNO detector has also the ca-
pability to observe neutral current events induced by neutrinos (the neutrino
dissociation of deuterons into protons and neutrons in heavy water). As the
neutral current events can be induced by all neutrino families such signal de-
termines the total solar neutrino ﬂux. It is found that it is larger than the νe
ﬂux and agrees nicely with the predictions of the solar models.
3.2 Helium Burning
No stable nuclei with mass numbers A = 5 and A = 8 exist. Thus, fusion
reactions of p+4He and 4He+4He lead to unstable resonant states in 5Li and

Nuclear Astrophysics
19
8Be which decay extremely fast. However, the lifetime of the 8Be ground state
resonance (∼10−16 s) is long enough to establish a small 8Be equilibrium
abundance under helium burning conditions (T ∼108 K, ρ ∼105 g/cm3
for a sun-like star), which amounts to about ∼5 × 10−10 of the equilibrium
4He abundance. As pointed out by Salpeter [24], this small 8Be equilibrium
abundance allows the capture of another 4He nucleus to form the stable 12C
nucleus. The second step of the triple-alpha fusion reaction is highly enlarged
by the presence of an s-wave resonance in 12C at a resonance energy of 287
keV. To derive the triple-alpha reaction rate under helium burning conditions,
it is suﬃcient to know the properties of this resonance. These quantities have
been determined experimentally and it is generally assumed that the triple-
alpha rate is known with an accuracy of about 15% for helium burning in Red
Giants. A current estimate for the uncertainty of the triple-α rate is given
in Ref. [25] which discusses also the inﬂuence of the rate on some aspects
of subsequent stellar evolution. An improved triple-α rate for temperatures
higher than in Red Giant helium burning is given in [26].
The second step in helium burning, the 12C(α, γ)16O reaction, is the cru-
cial reaction in stellar models of massive stars. Its rate determines the relative
importance of the subsequent carbon and oxygen burning stages, including
the abundances of the elements produced in these stages. The 12C(α, γ)16O
reaction determines also the relative abundance of 12C and 16O, the two bricks
for the formation of life, in the Universe. Stellar models are very sensitive to
this rate and its determination at the most eﬀective energy in helium burning
(E = 300 keV) with an accuracy of better than 20% is asked for. Despite
enormous experimental eﬀorts in the last 3 decades, this goal has not been
achieved yet, as the low-energy 12C(α, γ)16O reaction cross section is tremen-
dously tricky. Data have been taken down to energies of about E = 1 MeV,
requiring an extrapolation of the S-factor to E = 300 keV. The data are
dominated by a J = 1−resonance at E = 2.418 MeV. Unfortunately there
is another J = 1−level at E = −45 keV, just below the α+12C threshold.
These two states interfere. In the data the broad resonance at E = 2.418 MeV
dominates, while at stellar burning energies it is likely to be the other way
around. It turns out to be quite diﬃcult to determine the properties of the
particle-bound states, although a major step forward has been achieved using
indirect means by studying the β-decay of the 16N ground state to states in
16O above the α-threshold and their subsequent decay into the α+12C channel
[27]. The γ-decay of the J = 1−states to the 16O ground state is of dipole
(E1) nature. If isospin were a good quantum number, this transition would
be exactly forbidden, as all involved nuclei (4He, 12C, 16O) have isospin quan-
tum numbers T = 0. The observed dipole transition must then come from
small isospin-symmetry breaking admixtures. The data, indeed, suggest that
the transitions are suppressed by about 4 orders of magnitude compared to
‘normal’ E1 transitions. Such a large suppression makes it possible that E2
(quadrupole) transitions can compete with the dipole contributions. This is
conﬁrmed by measurements of the 12C(α, γ)16O angular distributions at low

20
K. Langanke
energies which are mixtures of dipole and quadrupole contributions. While
both, dipole and quadrupole, cross sections can thus be determined from the
data (although the measurement of angular distributions is much more chal-
lenging than the determination of the total cross section), the extrapolation
of the E2 data to stellar energies at E = 300 keV is strongly hampered by the
fact that the stellar cross section is dominated by the tail of a particle-bound
J = 2+ state at E = −245 keV, which, however, is much weaker in the data
taken at higher energies.
The latest results for the 12C(α, γ)16O S-factor are presented in [28] and
in [29].
The 16O(α, γ)20Ne is non-resonant at stellar energies and hence very slow,
compared to the α+12C reaction. Thus, helium burning ﬁnishes with the
12C(α, γ)16O reaction.
3.3 Carbon, Neon, Oxygen burning
In the fusion of two 12C nuclei, the α and proton-channels have positive
Q-values (Q = 4.62 MeV and Q = 2.24 MeV). Thus, the fusion produces
nuclides with smaller charge numbers, which can then interact with other
carbon nuclei or produced elements. The main reactions in carbon burn-
ing are:
12C(12C,α)20Ne,
12C(12C,p)23Na,
23Na(p,α)20Ne,
23Na(p,γ)24Mg,
12C(α, γ)16O, which determine the basic energy generation. However, many
other reactions can occur, even producing elements beyond 24Mg like 26Mg
and 27Al.
The 12C+12C fusion cross section data at low energies show oscillations,
which are characteristic for resonances and have been interpreted as evi-
dence for the existence of 12C+12C molecules. Astrophysically it is interesting
whether the resonant behavior of the fusion data (measured down to E ∼2.3
MeV) continues to lower energies which might have consequences in the sim-
ulations of the screening corrections for this reaction in compact objects.
Neon burning occurs at temperatures just above T = 109 K. At these
conditions the presence of high-energy photons is suﬃcient to photodissociate
20Ne via the 20Ne(γ,α)16O reaction which has a Q-value of -4.73 MeV. This
reaction liberates α particles which react then very fast with other 20Ne nuclei
leading to the production of 28Si via the chain 20Ne(α,γ)24Mg(α,γ)28Si. Again,
many other reactions induced by protons, 4He and also neutrons, which are
produced within the occurring reaction chains, occur.
In the fusion of two 16O nuclei, the α and proton-channels have positive
Q-values (Q = 9.59 MeV and Q = 7.68 MeV). Like in carbon burning, the
liberated protons and 4He nuclei react with other 16O nuclei. Among the
many nuclides produced during oxygen burning are nuclei like 33Si and 35Cl.
These have quite low Q-values against electron captures making it energet-
ically favorable to capture electrons from the degenerate electron sea (the
Fermi energies of electrons during core oxygen burning is of order 1 MeV) via
the 33Si(e−ν)33P and 35Cl(e−ν)35S reactions. The emitted neutrinos carry

energy away, thus cooling the star. In fact, neutrino emission is the most ef-
fective cooling mechanism during all advanced burning stages, subsequent to
helium burning. As we will see in the next section, electron captures play also
a decisive role in core-collapse supernovae.
3.4 Silicon Burning
The nuclear reaction network during silicon burning is initiated by the pho-
todissociation of 28Si, producing protons, neutrons and α-particles. These par-
ticles react again with 28Si or the nuclides produced. During silicon burning,
the temperature is already quite high (T ∼3 −4 × 109 K). This makes the
nuclear reactions mediated by the strong and electromagnetic force quite fast
and a chemical equilibrium between reactions and their inverse processes es-
tablishes. Under such conditions, the abundance distributions of the nuclides
present in the network becomes independent of the reaction rates, establishing
the Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE) (see [30, 31]). Then the abundance
of a nuclide with proton and neutron numbers Z and N can be expressed in
terms of the abundance of free protons and neutrons by:
YZ,N = GZ,N(ρNA)(A−1) A3/2
2A ( 2πℏ2
mukT )3/2(A−1) exp{BZ,N
kT }Y N
n Y Z
p
(38)
where GZ,N is the nuclear partition function (at temperature T), BZ,N the
binding excess of the nucleus, mu the unit nuclear mass and Yp, Yn are the
abundances of free protons and neutrons. The NSE distribution is subject to
the mass and charge conservation, which can be formulated as:

i
AiYi = 1 ;

i
ZiYi = Ye
(39)
where Ye is the electron-to-nucleon ratio. Until the onset of oxygen burning,
one has Ye=0.5 (nuclei like 12C have identical protron and neutron num-
bers, while the number of electrons equals the proton number). Once electron
capture processes start, the Ye value is reduced (protons are changed into
neutrons, while the total number of nucleons is preserved). The value of Ye
changes as reactions mediated by the weak force are not in equilibrium (there
is no abundance of neutrinos in the star which can initiate the inverse reac-
tions). However, this changes in the late stage of a core-collapse supernova.
For ‘normal’ temperatures and densities, NSE favours the nuclei with high-
est binding energies (among those with Z/A ∼Ye dictated by charge conser-
vation). However, we observe from Eq. (38) the following two limiting cases
which are both relevant for core collapse supernovae. Due to the factor ρA−1
the NSE distribution favors increasingly heavier nuclei with increasing density
(at ﬁxed temperature); this happens during the collapse. On the contrary, the
factor T −3/2(A−1) implies that, at ﬁxed densities, the NSE distribution drives
to nuclei with smaller masses with increasing temperature; in the high-T limit

22
K. Langanke
the nuclei get all disassembled into free protons and neutrons; this occurs in
the shock-heated material.
We ﬁnally note that, during silicon burning, not a full NSE is established.
However, the nuclear chart breaks into several regions in which NSE equilib-
rium is established. The diﬀerent regions are not yet in equilibrium, as the
nuclear reactions connecting them are yet not fast enough. One uses the term
‘Quasi-NSE” for these conditions.
4 Core Collapse Supernovae
At the end of hydrostatic burning, a massive star consists of concentric shells
that are the remnants of its previous burning phases (hydrogen, helium, car-
bon, neon, oxygen, silicon). Iron is the ﬁnal stage of nuclear fusion in hydrosta-
tic burning, as the synthesis of any heavier element from lighter elements does
not release energy; rather, energy must be used up. If the iron core, formed
in the center of the massive star, exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass limit of
about 1.44 solar masses, electron degeneracy pressure cannot longer stabilize
the core and it collapses starting what is called a type II supernova. In its
aftermath the star explodes and parts of the iron core and the outer shells are
ejected into the Interstellar Medium. Although this general picture has been
conﬁrmed by the various observations from supernova SN1987a, simulations
of the core collapse and the explosion are still far from being completely un-
derstood and robustly modelled. To improve the input which goes into the
simulation of type II supernovae and to improve the models and their numeri-
cal simulations is a very active research ﬁeld at various institutions worldwide.
The collapse is very sensitive to the entropy and to the number of leptons
per baryon, Ye [32]. In turn these two quantities are mainly determined by
weak interaction processes, electron capture and β decay. First, in the early
stage of the collapse Ye is reduced as it is energetically favorable to capture
electrons, which at the densities involved have Fermi energies of a few MeV,
by (Fe-peak) nuclei. This reduces the electron pressure, thus accelerating the
collapse, and shifts the distribution of nuclei present in the core to more
neutron-rich material. Second, many of the nuclei present can also β decay.
While this process is quite unimportant compared to electron capture for
initial Ye values around 0.5, it becomes increasingly competitive for neutron-
rich nuclei due to an increase in phase space related to larger Qβ values.
Electron capture, β decay and photodisintegration cost the core energy
and reduce its electron density. As a consequence, the collapse is accelerated.
An important change in the physics of the collapse occurs, as the density
reaches ρtrap ≈4 · 1011 g/cm3. Then neutrinos are essentially trapped in the
core, as their diﬀusion time (due to coherent elastic scattering on nuclei) be-
comes larger than the collapse time [33]. After neutrino trapping, the collapse
proceeds homologously [34], until nuclear densities (ρN ≈1014 g/cm3) are
reached. As nuclear matter has a ﬁnite compressibility, the homologous core

23
decelerates and bounces in response to the increased nuclear matter pressure;
this eventually drives an outgoing shock wave into the outer core; i.e. the en-
velope of the iron core outside the homologous core, which in the meantime
has continued to fall inwards at supersonic speed. The core bounce with the
formation of a shock wave is believed to be the mechanism that triggers a su-
pernova explosion, but several ingredients of this physically appealing picture
and the actual mechanism of a supernova explosion are still uncertain and
controversial. If the shock wave is strong enough not only to stop the collapse,
but also to explode the outer burning shells of the star, one speaks about the
‘prompt mechanism’ [35]. However, it appears as if the energy available to the
shock is not suﬃcient, and the shock will store its energy in the outer core,
for example, by dissociation of nuclei into nucleons. Furthermore, this change
in composition results to additional energy losses, as the electron capture rate
on free protons is signiﬁcantly larger than on neutron-rich nuclei due to the
smaller Q-values involved. This leads to a further neutronization of the mat-
ter. Part of the neutrinos produced by the capture on the free protons behind
the shock leave the star carrying away energy.
After the core bounce, a compact remnant is left behind. Depending on
the stellar mass, this is either a neutron star (masses roughly smaller than 30
solar masses) or a black hole. The neutron star remnant is very lepton-rich
(electrons and neutrinos), the latter being trapped as their mean free paths in
the dense matter is signiﬁcantly shorter than the radius of the neutron star. It
takes a fraction of a second [36] for the trapped neutrinos to diﬀuse out, giving
most of their energy to the neutron star during that process and heating it
up. The cooling of the proto-neutron star then proceeds by pair production
of neutrinos of all three generations which diﬀuse out. After several tens of
seconds the star becomes transparent to neutrinos and the neutrino luminosity
drops signiﬁcantly [37].
In the ‘delayed mechanism’, the shock wave can be revived by the outward
diﬀusing neutrinos, which carry most of the energy set free in the gravitational
collapse of the core [36] and deposit some of this energy in the layers between
the nascent neutron star and the stalled prompt shock. This lasts for a few
100 ms, and requires about 1% of the neutrino energy to be converted into
nuclear kinetic energy. The energy deposition increases the pressure behing the
shock and the respective layers begin to expand, leaving between shock front
and neutron star surface a region of low density, but rather high temperature.
This region is called the ‘hot neutrino bubble’. The persistent energy input by
neutrinos keeps the pressure high in this region and drives the shock outwards
again, eventually leading to a supernova explosion.
It has been found that the delayed supernova mechanism is quite sensitive
to physics details deciding about success or failure in the simulation of the
explosion. Very recently, two quite distinct improvements have been proposed
(convective energy transport [38, 39] and in-medium modiﬁcations of the neu-
trino opacities [40, 41]) which increase the eﬃciency of the energy transport
to the stalled shock.

24

Current one-dimensional supernova simulations, including sophisticated
neutrino transport, fail to explode [42, 43] (however, see [44]). The interest-
ing question is whether the simulations explicitly require multi-dimensional
eﬀects like rotation, magnetic ﬁelds or convection (e.g. [38, 39]) or whether
the microphysics input in the one-dimensional models is insuﬃcient. It is the
goal of nuclear astrophysics to improve on this microphysics input. The next
section shows that core collapse supernovae are nice examples to demonstrate
how important micro-physics input and progress in nuclear modelling can be.
4.1 The Role of Electron Capture and β Decay During Collapse
Late-stage stellar evolution is described in two steps. In the presupernova
models the evolution is studied through the various hydrostatic core and shell
burning phases until the central core density reaches values up to 1010 g/cm3.
The models consider a large nuclear reaction network. However, the densities
involved are small enough to treat neutrinos solely as an energy loss source.
For even higher densities this is no longer true as neutrino-matter interactions
become increasingly important. In modern core-collapse codes neutrino trans-
port is described self-consistently by spherically symmetric multigroup Boltz-
mann simulations. While this is computationally very challenging, collapse
models have the advantage that the matter composition can be derived from
Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE) as the core temperature and density
are high enough to keep reactions mediated by the strong and electromagnetic
interactions in equilibrium. This means that for suﬃciently low entropies, the
matter composition is dominated by the nuclei with the highest Q-values for a
given Ye. The presupernova models are the input for the collapse simulations
which follow the evolution through trapping, bounce and hopefully explosion.
The collapse is a competition of the two weakest forces in nature: grav-
ity versus weak interaction, where electron captures on nuclei and protons
and, during a period of silicon burning, also β-decay play the crucial roles.
Which nuclei are important? Weak-interaction processes become important
when nuclei with masses A ∼55 −60 (pf-shell nuclei) are most abundant in
the core (although capture on sd shell nuclei has to be considered as well). As
weak interactions changes Ye and electron capture dominates, the Ye value is
successively reduced from its initial value ∼0.5. As a consequence, the abun-
dant nuclei become more neutron rich and heavier, as nuclei with decreasing
Z/A ratios are more bound in heavier nuclei. Two further general remarks
are useful. There are many nuclei with appreciable abundances in the cores of
massive stars during their ﬁnal evolution. Neither the nucleus with the largest
capture rate nor the most abundant one are necessarily the most relevant for
the dynamical evolution: What makes a nucleus relevant is the product of rate
times abundance.
For densities ρ ≤1011 g/cm3, stellar weak-interaction processes are dom-
inated by Gamow-Teller (GT) and, if applicable, by Fermi transitions. At

Nuclear Astrophysics
25
higher densities forbidden transitions have to be included as well. To under-
stand the requirements for the nuclear models to describe these processes
(mainly electron capture), it is quite useful to recognize that electron capture
is governed by two energy scales: the electron chemical potential µe, which
grows like ρ1/3, and the nuclear Q-value. Importantly, µe grows much faster
than the Q values of the abundant nuclei. We can conclude that at low densi-
ties, where one has µe ∼Q (i.e. at presupernova conditions), the capture rate
will be very sensitive to the phase space and requires an accurate as possible
description of the detailed GT+ distribution of the nuclei involved. Further-
more, the ﬁnite temperature in the star requires the implicit consideration of
capture on excited nuclear states, for which the GT distribution can be dif-
ferent than for the ground state. As we will demonstrate below, modern shell
model calculations are capable to describe GT+ rather well and are therefore
the appropriate tool to calculate the weak-interaction rates for those nuclei
(A ∼50 −65) which are relevant at such densities. At higher densities, when
µe is suﬃciently larger than the respective nuclear Q values, the capture rate
becomes less sensitive to the detailed GT+ distribution and is mainly only
dependent on the total GT strength. Thus, less sophisticated nuclear models
might be suﬃcient. However, one is facing a nuclear structure problem which
has been overcome only very recently. We come back to it below, after we have
discussed the calculations of weak-interaction rates within the shell model and
their implications to presupernova models.
In recent years it has been possible to derive the electron capture (and
other weak-interaction rates) needed for presupernova and collapse models on
the basis of microscopic nuclear models. The results are quite distinct from
the more empirical rates used before and have lead to signiﬁcant changes in
supernova simulations. This progress and the related changes are discussed in
the next two subsections.
4.2 Weak-interaction Rates and Presupernova Evolution
The general formalism to calculate weak interaction rates for stellar environ-
ment has been given by Fuller, Fowler and Newman (FFN) [45, 46, 47, 48].
These authors also estimated the stellar electron capture and beta-decay rates
systematically for nuclei in the mass range A = 20 −60 based on the inde-
pendent particle model and on data, whenever available. In recent years this
pioneering and seminal work has been replaced by rates based on large-scale
shell model calculations. At ﬁrst, Oda et al. derived such rates for sd-shell nu-
clei (A = 17 −39) and found rather good agreement with the FFN rates [49].
Similar calculations for pf-shell nuclei had to wait until signiﬁcant progress
in shell model diagonalization, mainly due to Etienne Caurier, allowed cal-
culations in either the full pf shell or at such a truncation level that the
GT distributions were virtually converged. It has been demonstrated in [50]
that the shell model reproduces all measured GT+ distributions very well and
gives a very reasonable account of the experimentally known GT−distribu-

tions. Further, the lifetimes of the nuclei and the spectroscopy at low energies
is simultaneously also described well. Charge-exchange measurements using
the (d,2He) reaction at intermediate energies allow now for an experimental
determination of the GT+ strength distribution with an energy resolution
of about 150 keV. Fig. 2 compares the experimental GT+ strength for 51V,
measured at the KVI in Groningen [51], with shell model predictions. It can
be concluded that modern shell model approaches have the necessary pre-
dictive power to reliably estimate stellar weak interaction rates. Such rates
have been presented in [52, 53]. for more than 100 nuclei in the mass range
A = 45-65. The rates have been calculated for the same temperature and
density grid as the standard FFN compilations [46, 47]. An electronic table of
the rates is available [53]. Importantly one ﬁnds that the shell model electron
capture rates are systematically smaller than the FFN rates. The diﬀerence is
particularly large for capture on odd-odd nuclei which have been previously
assumed to dominate electron capture in the early stage of the collapse [54].
The diﬀerences are related to an insuﬃcient treatment of pairing in the FFN
parametrization, as discussed in [52].
To study the inﬂuence of the shell model rates on presupernova models
Heger et al. [55, 56] have repeated the calculations of Weaver and Woosley [57]
keeping the stellar physics, except for the weak rates, as close to the original

studies as possible. Fig. 3 exempliﬁes the consequences of the shell model
weak interaction rates for presupernova models in terms of the three decisive
quantities: the central Ye value and entropy and the iron core mass. The central
values of Ye at the onset of core collapse increased by 0.01-0.015 for the new
rates. This is a signiﬁcant eﬀect. We note that the new models also result in
lower core entropies for stars with M ≤20M⊙, while for M ≥20M⊙, the
new models actually have a slightly larger entropy. The iron core masses are
generally smaller in the new models where the eﬀect is larger for more massive
stars (M ≥20M⊙), while for the most common supernovae (M ≤20M⊙) the
reduction is by about 0.05 M⊙.
Electron capture dominates the weak-interaction processes during presu-
pernova evolution. However, during silicon burning, β decay (which increases
Ye) can compete and adds to the further cooling of the star. With increasing
densities, β-decays are hindered as the increasing Fermi energy of the elec-
trons blocks the available phase space for the decay. Thus, during collapse
β-decays can be neglected.
We note that the shell model weak interaction rates predict the presuper-
nova evolution to proceed along a temperature-density-Ye trajectory where
the weak processes are dominated by nuclei rather close to stability. Thus
it will be possible, after radioactive ion-beam facilities become operational,
to further constrain the shell model calculations by measuring relevant beta
decays and GT distributions for unstable nuclei. Ref. [55, 56] identify those
nuclei which dominate (deﬁned by the product of abundance times rate) the
electron capture and beta decay during various stages of the ﬁnal evolution
of a 15M⊙, 25M⊙and 40M⊙star.

4.3 The Role of Electron Capture During Collapse
In collapse simulations a very simple description for electron capture on nuclei
has been used until recently, as the rates have been estimated in the spirit
of the independent particle model (IPM), assuming pure Gamow-Teller (GT)
transitions and considering only single particle states for proton and neutron
numbers between N = 20–40 [58]. In particular this model assigns vanishing
electron capture rates to nuclei with neutron numbers larger than N = 40,
motivated by the observation [59] that, within the IPM, GT transitions are
Pauli-blocked for nuclei with N ≥40 and Z ≤40. However, as electron
capture reduces Ye, the nuclear composition is shifted to more neutron rich
and to heavier nuclei, including those with N > 40, which dominate the matter
composition for densities larger than a few 1010 g cm−3. As a consequence of
the model applied in the previous collapse simulations, electron capture on
nuclei ceases at these densities and the capture is entirely due to free protons.
This employed model for electron capture on nuclei is too simple and leads to
incorrect conclusions, as the Pauli-blocking of the GT transitions is overcome
by correlations [62] and temperature eﬀects [59, 60] (see also [61]).
At ﬁrst, the residual nuclear interaction, beyond the IPM, mixes the pf
shell with the levels of the sdg shell, in particular with the lowest orbital, g9/2.
This makes the closed g9/2 orbit a magic number in stable nuclei (N = 50)
and introduces, for example, a very strong deformation in the N = Z = 40
nucleus 80Zr. Moreover, the description of the B(E2,0+ →2+
1 ) transition in
68Ni requires conﬁgurations where more than one neutron is promoted from
the pf shell into the g9/2 orbit [63], unblocking the GT transition even in this
proton-magic N = 40 nucleus. Such a non-vanishing GT strength has already
been observed for 72Ge (N = 40) [64] and 76Se (N = 42) [65]. Secondly,
during core collapse electron capture on the nuclei of interest here occurs at
temperatures T ≥0.8 MeV, which, in the Fermi gas model, corresponds to
a nuclear excitation energy U ≈AT 2/8 ≈5 MeV; this energy is noticeably
larger than the splitting of the pf and sdg orbitals (Eg9/2 −Ep1/2,f5/2 ≈3
MeV). Hence, the conﬁguration mixing of sdg and pf orbitals will be rather
strong in those excited nuclear states of relevance for stellar electron capture.
Furthermore, the nuclear state density at E ∼5 MeV is already larger than
100/MeV, making a state-by-state calculation of the rates impossible, but
also emphasizing the need for a nuclear model which describes the correla-
tion energy scale at the relevant temperatures appropriately. This model is
the Shell Model Monte Carlo (SMMC) approach [66, 67] which describes the
nucleus by a canonical ensemble at ﬁnite temperature and employs a Hubbard-
Stratonovich linearization [68] of the imaginary-time many-body propagator
to express observables as path integrals of one-body propagators in ﬂuctuat-
ing auxiliary ﬁelds [66, 67]. Since Monte Carlo techniques avoid an explicit
enumeration of the many-body states, they can be used in model spaces far
larger than those accessible to conventional methods. The Monte Carlo results

Nuclear Astrophysics
29
are in principle exact and are in practice subject only to controllable sampling
and discretization errors.
To calculate electron capture rates for nuclei A = 65–112 SMMC calcula-
tions have been performed in the full pf-sdg shell, considering upto more than
1020 conﬁgurations. From the SMMC calculations the temperature-dependent
occupation numbers of the various single-particle orbitals have been deter-
mined. These occupation numbers then became the input in RPA calculations
of the capture rate, considering allowed and forbidden transitions up to mul-
tipoles J = 4 and including the momentum dependence of the operators. The
model is described in [62]; ﬁrst applications in collapse simulations are pre-
sented in [69, 74]. There have been several nuclear structure studies performed
with the SMMC in the same model space and with the same interaction which
give conﬁdence that the model is capable of described correlations across the
N = 40 gap quite well. These studies dealt with the magicity of the nu-
cleus 68Ni [70], the origin of deformation in the N ∼Z ∼40 nuclei [71] and
the competition of pairing and deformation degrees of freedom as function of
temperature [72].

the rates.
For all studied nuclei one ﬁnds neutron holes in the (pf) shell and, for
Z > 30, non-negligible proton occupation numbers for the sdg orbitals. This
unblocks the GT transitions and leads to sizable electron capture rates. Fig. 4
compares the electron capture rates for free protons and selected nuclei along
a core collapse trajectory, as taken from [43]. Dependent on their proton-

stages of the collapse. For all nuclei, the rates are dominated by GT transitions
at low densities, while forbidden transitions contribute sizably at ρ ≥1011
g/cm3.
Simulations of core collapse require reaction rates for electron capture on
protons, Rp = Ypλp, and nuclei Rh = !
i Yiλi (where the sum runs over all
the nuclei present and Yi denotes the number abundance of a given species),
over wide ranges in density and temperature. While Rp is readily derived
from [58], the calculation of Rh requires knowledge of the nuclear composi-
tion, in addition to the electron capture rates described earlier. In [69, 74]
NSE has been adopted to determine the needed abundances of individual iso-
topes and to calculate Rh and the associated emitted neutrino spectra on the
basis of about 200 nuclei in the mass range A = 45 −112 as a function of
temperature, density and electron fraction. The rates for the inverse neutrino-
absorption process are determined from the electron capture rates by detailed
balance. Due to its much smaller |Q|-value, the electron capture rate on the
free protons is larger than the rates of abundant nuclei during the core col-
lapse (Fig. 4). However, this is misleading as the low entropy keeps the protons
signiﬁcantly less abundant than heavy nuclei during the collapse. Fig. 5 shows
that the reaction rate on nuclei, Rh, dominates the one on protons, Rp, by
roughly an order of magnitude throughout the collapse when the composition
is considered. Only after the bounce shock has formed does Rp become higher
than Rh, due to the high entropies and high temperatures in the shock-heated

matter that result in a high proton abundance. The obvious conclusion is that
electron capture on nuclei must be included in collapse simulations.
It is also important to stress that electron capture on nuclei and on free
protons diﬀer quite noticeably in the neutrino spectra they generate. This is
demonstrated in Fig. 5 which shows that neutrinos from captures on nuclei
have a mean energy 40–60% less than those produced by capture on protons.
Although capture on nuclei under stellar conditions involves excited states in
the parent and daughter nuclei, it is mainly the larger |Q|-value which signif-
icantly shifts the energies of the emitted neutrinos to smaller values. These
diﬀerences in the neutrino spectra strongly inﬂuence neutrino-matter interac-
tions, which scale with the square of the neutrino energy and are essential for
collapse simulations [43, 42] (see below).

Fig. 6. The electron fraction and velocity as functions of the enclosed mass at
bounce for a 15 M⊙model [55]. The thin line is a simulation using the Bruenn
parameterization while the thick line is for a simulation using the combined LMP [73]
and SMMC+RPA rate sets. Both models were calculated with Newtonian gravity.
The eﬀects of this more realistic implementation of electron capture on
heavy nuclei have been evaluated in independent self-consistent neutrino ra-
diation hydrodynamics simulations by the Oak Ridge and Garching collabo-
rations [74, 75]. The basis of these models is described in detail in Refs. [43]
and [42]. Both collapse simulations yield qualitatively the same results. The
changes compared to the previous simulations, which adopted the IPM rate
estimate from Ref. [58] and hence basically ignored electron capture on nu-
clei, are signiﬁcant. Fig. 6 shows a key result: In denser regions, the additional
electron capture on heavy nuclei results in more electron capture in the new

32
K. Langanke
models. In lower density regions, where nuclei with A < 65 dominate, the shell
model rates [52] result in less electron capture. The results of these competing
eﬀects can be seen in the ﬁrst panel of Figure 6, which shows the distribution
of Ye throughout the core at bounce (when the maximum central density is
reached). The combination of increased electron capture in the interior with
reduced electron capture in the outer regions causes the shock to form with
16% less mass interior to it and a 10% smaller velocity diﬀerence across the
shock. This leads to a smaller mass of the homologuous core (by about 0.1
M⊙). In spite of this mass reduction, the radius from which the shock is
launched is actually displaced slightly outwards to 15.7 km from 14.8 km in
the old models. If the only eﬀect of the improvement in the treatment of elec-
tron capture on nuclei were to launch a weaker shock with more of the iron
core overlying it, this improvement would seem to make a successful explosion
more diﬃcult. However, the altered gradients in density and lepton fraction
also play an important role in the behavior of the shock. Though also the
new models fail to produce explosions in the spherically symmetric limit, the
altered gradients allow the shock in the case with improved capture rates to
reach 205 km, which is about 10 km further out than in the old models.
These calculations clearly show that the many neutron-rich nuclei which
dominate the nuclear composition throughout the collapse of a massive star
also dominate the rate of electron capture. Astrophysics simulations have
demonstrated that these rates have a strong impact on the core collapse tra-
jectory and the properties of the core at bounce. The evaluation of the rates
has to rely on theory as a direct experimental determination of the rates
for the relevant stellar conditions (i.e. rather high temperatures) is currently
impossible. Nevertheless it is important to experimentally explore the con-
ﬁguration mixing between pf and sdg shell in extremely neutron-rich nuclei
as such understanding will guide and severely constrain nuclear models. Such
guidance is expected from future radioactive ion-beam facilities.
4.4 Neutrino-induced Processes During a Supernova Collapse
While the neutrinos can leave the star unhindered during the presupernova
evolution, neutrino-induced reactions become more and more important dur-
ing the subsequent collapse stage due to the increasing matter density and
neutrino energies; the latter are of order a few MeV in the presupernova
models, but increase roughly approximately to the electron chemical poten-
tial [58, 62]. Elastic neutrino scattering oﬀnuclei and inelastic scattering on
electrons are the two most important neutrino-induced reactions during the
collapse. The ﬁrst reaction randomizes the neutrino paths out of the core and,
at densities of a few 1011 g/cm3, the neutrino diﬀusion time-scale gets larger
than the collapse time; the neutrinos are trapped in the core for the rest of the
contraction. Inelastic scattering oﬀelectrons thermalizes the trapped neutri-
nos then rather fastly with the matter and the core collapses as a homologous
unit until it reaches densities slightly in excess of nuclear matter, generating

33
a bounce and launching a shock wave which traverses through the infalling
material on top of the homologous core. In the currently favored explosion
model, the shock wave is not energetic enough to explode the star, it gets
stalled before reaching the outer edge of the iron core, but is then eventually
revived due to energy transfer by neutrinos from the cooling remnant in the
center to the matter behind the stalled shock.
Neutrino-induced reactions on nuclei, other than elastic scattering, can
also play a role during the collapse and explosion phase [76]. Note that dur-
ing the collapse only νe neutrinos are present. Thus, charged-current reac-
tions A(νe, e−)A′ are strongly blocked by the large electron chemical poten-
tial [77, 78]. Inelastic neutrino scattering on nuclei can compete with νe + e−
scattering at higher neutrino energies Eν ≥20 MeV [77]. Here the cross sec-
tions are mainly dominated by ﬁrst-forbidden transitions. Finite-temperature
eﬀects play an important role for inelastic ν + A scattering below Eν ≤10
MeV. This comes about as nuclear states get thermally excited which are con-
nected to the ground state and low-lying excited states by modestly strong
GT transitions and increased phase space. As a consequence the cross sec-
tions are signiﬁcantly increased for low neutrino energies at ﬁnite temperature
and might be comparable to inelastic νe + e−scattering [79]. Thus, inelastic
neutrino-nucleus scattering, which is so far neglected in collapse simulations,
should be implemented in such studies. This is in particular motivated by
the fact that it has been demonstrated that electron capture on nuclei domi-
nated during the collapse and this mode generates signiﬁcantly less energetic
neutrinos than considered previously. Examples for inelastic neutrino-nucleus
cross sections are shown in Fig. 7. A reliable estimate for these cross sections
requires the knowledge of the GT0 strength (see below). Shell model predic-
tions imply that the GT0 centroid resides at excitation energies around 10
MeV and is independent of the pairing structure of the ground state [80, 79].
Finite temperature eﬀects become unimportant for stellar inelastic neutrino-
nucleus cross sections once the neutrino energy is large enough to reach the
GT0 centroid, i.e. for Eν ≥10 MeV.
The trapped νe neutrinos will be released from the core in a brief burst
shortly after bounce. These neutrinos can interact with the infalling matter
just before arrival of the shock and eventually preheat the matter requiring less
energy from the shock for dissociation [76]. The relevant preheating processes
are charged- and neutral-current reactions on nuclei in the iron and also sili-
con mass range. So far, no detailed collapse simulation including preheating
has been performed. The relevant cross sections can be calculated on the ba-
sis of shell model calculations for the allowed transitions and RPA studies for
the forbidden transitions [80]. The main energy transfer to the matter behind
the shock, however, is due to neutrino absorption on free nucleons. The eﬃ-
ciency of this transport depends strongly on the neutrino opacities in hot and
very dense neutron-rich matter [82]. It is likely also supported by convective
motion, requiring multidimensional simulations [83].

4.5 Explosive Nucleosynthesis
When in an successful explosion the shock passes through the outer shells, its
high temperature induces an explosive nuclear burning on short time-scales.
This explosive nucleosynthesis can alter the elemental abundance distribu-
tions in the inner (silicon, oxygen) shells. Recently explosive nucleosynthe-
sis has been investigated consistently within supernova simulations, where a
successful explosion has been enforced by slightly enlargening the neutrino
absorption cross section on nucleons or the neutrino mean-free path, which
both increase the eﬃciency of the energy transport to the stalled shock. The
results presented in [84, 85] showed that in an early phase after the bounce
the ejected matter is actually proton-rich. The proton-to-nucleon ratio Ye is
determined by the competition of the neutrino and anti-neutrino absorption
on free nucleons where in this early phase, the νe neutrinos have suﬃciently
large energies to drive the matter proton-rich. In later stages, when neutri-
nos are produced by pair emission due to cooling of the proto-neutron star,
the neutrino opacities in the neutron-rich matter ensures that ¯νe have larger
average energies than νe and ¯νe absorption on protons dominates driving the
matter neutron-rich (allowing for the r-process to occur).
Nucleosynthesis in the proton-rich environment allows for the generation of
certain elements like Sc, Cu, Zn, which have been strongly underproduced in
previous studies. Another interesting result is shown in Fig. 8 which shows the
importance of neutrino-induced reactions during the nucleosynthesis process.
Thus, neutrino interactions do not only determine the Ye value of the mat-
ter, they also strongly inﬂuence the matter ﬂow. In the proton-rich matter,
neutrons are basically incorporated into wellbound N = Z nuclei like 56Ni or
64Ge, with some free protons available. These nuclei have halﬂives (beta de-
cay or against proton capture) which are longer than the duration time of the

Nuclear Astrophysics
35
process. Thus, the network would come to a hold, if neutrino interactions were
to be ignored. While reactions induced by νe are suppressed, as all neutrons
are in nuclei, ¯νe absorption on the free protons are a source of free neutrons
which are then captured by heavy nuclei. Thus the network can continue well
to nuclei heavier than 64Ge. It is currently investigated how much this new
nucleosynthesis process (called νp process by Martinez-Pinedo) contributes to
the production of proton-rich nuclei in the mass range A ∼64 −100.
Fig. 8. Elemental abundance yields (normalized to solar) for elements produced
in the proton-rich environment shortly after the supernova shock formation. The
matter ﬂow stops at nuclei like 56Ni and 64Ge (open circles), but can proceed to
heavier elements if neutrino reactions are included during the network (full circles)
(from [86]).
4.6 Constraining Neutrino-nucleus Cross Sections from Data
Currently no data for inelastic neutral-current neutrino-nucleus cross sections
are available for supernova-relevant nuclei (A ∼60). However, as has been
demonstrated in [87], precision M1 data, obtained by inelastic electron scat-
tering, supply the required information about the Gamow-Teller GT0 distri-
bution which determines the inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections for su-
pernova neutrino energies. The argumentation is built on the observation that
for M1 transitions the isovector part dominates and the respective isovector
M1 operator is given by
Oiv =

4π

k
[l(k)bftz(k) + 4.706σ(k)tz(k)] µN
(40)
where the sum is over all nucleons and µN is the nuclear magneton, and the
spin part of the isovector M1 operator is proportional to the desired zero-

36
K. Langanke
component of the GT operator. Thus, experimental M1 data yield the needed
GT0 information to determine supernova neutrino-nucleus cross sections, to
the extent that the isoscalar and orbital pieces present in the M1 operator
can be neglected. First, it is wellknown that the major strength of the or-
bital and spin M1 responses are energetically well separated. Furthermore,
the orbital part is strongly related to deformation and is suppressed in spher-
ical nuclei, like 50Ti, 52Cr, 54Fe. These nuclei have the additional advantage
that M1 response data exist from high-resolution inelastic electron scattering
experiments [88]. Satisfyingly, large-scale shell model calculations reproduce
the M1 data quite well, even in details [87]. The calculation also conﬁrms
that the orbital and isoscalar M1 strengths are much smaller than the isovec-
tor spin strength. Thus, the M1 data represent, in a good approximation,
the needed GT0 information (upto a constant factor). Fig. 9 compares the
inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections for the 3 studied nuclei, calculated
from the experimental M1 data and from the shell model GT0 strength. The
agreement is quite satisfactory. It is further improved, if one corrects for pos-
sible M1 strength outside of the explored experimental energy window. Also
diﬀerential neutrino-nucleus cross sections as functions of initial and ﬁnal neu-
trino energies, calculated from the M1 data and the shell model, agree quite
well [87]. On the basis of this comparison, one can conclude that the shell
model is validated for the calculations of inelastic neutral-current supernova
neutrino-nucleus cross sections. This model can then also be used to calculate
these cross sections at the ﬁnite temperature in the supernova environment
[87]. Juodagalvis et al. have calculated double-diﬀerential inelastic neutrino-
nucleus cross sections for many nuclei in the A ∼56 mass range, based on
shell model treatment of the GT transitions and on RPA studies of the for-
bidden contributions [81]. A detailed table of the cross sections as function
of initial and ﬁnal neutrino energies and for various temperatures is available
from the authors of [81].
4.7 Supernova Neutrino Observation and Constraints
Supernova neutrinos from SN1987a have been observed by the Kamiokande
and IMB detectors and have conﬁrmed the general supernova picture. The
observed events were most likely due to ¯νe neutrinos. To detect the predicted
diﬀerences in the distributions for the various neutrino families and thus more
restrictive tests of current supernova models requires the ability of neutrino
spectroscopy by the neutrino detectors. Current and future detectors (e.g.
Superkamiokande, SNO, KamLAND, ICARUS, OMNIS) have this capability
and will be able to distinguish between the diﬀerent neutrino types and de-
termine their individual spectra. The various detectors need neutrino-induced
cross sections for 16O (Superkamiokande), 40Ar (ICARUS) and 208Pb (OM-
NIS) (see [89]).
While supernova νµ, ντ and their antiparticles (combined called νx) and
νe neutrinos are not directly observed yet, Heger et al. [90] point out that

constraints on their spectra might be attainable from nucleosynthesis consid-
erations within the ν process [91]. In the ν process certain nuclides can be
made in a large fraction of their observed solar abundance by neutrino-induced
spallation oﬀnuclei in the outer shells of a massive star during a supernova
explosion. The main observation is that the huge ﬂuence of neutrinos in a
supernova can overcome the tinyness of the neutrino-nucleus cross sections
and in situations where, as a rule of thumb [92], the solar abundance of the
daughter is smaller than the parent abundance by three orders of magnitude
or more, neutrino nucleosynthesis can signiﬁcantly contribute to the solar pro-
duction of the daughter. Woosley et al. [91] showed that the ν-process, i.e.
nucleosynthesis by neutrino-induced reactions, can be responsible for most or
a large fraction of the solar 11B, 19F, 138La and 180Ta abundance. For 11B
and 19F the ν-process excites the parent nuclides 12C and 20Ne above the
particle thresholds where they then decay by proton or neutron emission. As
both nuclides have rather large particle thresholds, the neutrino nucleosyn-
thesis of 11B and 19F is dominated by neutral-current reactions induced by
supernova νx neutrinos which have the higher energy spectrum compared to
νe and ¯νe neutrinos. However, as found in detailed stellar evolution studies
[90] the rare odd-odd nuclide 138La is mainly made by the charged-current
reaction 138Ba(νe, e−)138La. Hence, the ν-process is potentially sensitive to
the spectra and luminosity of νe and νx neutrinos, which are the neutrino
types not observed from SN1987a. The GT strength on 138Ba has recently
been measured by the (3He,t) reaction in Osaka [88]; the 138Ba(νe, e−)138La

cross section derived from these data agrees quite well with the calculated one
adopted in [90].
We mention that neutrino nucleosynthesis studies are quite evolved re-
quiring state-of-the-art stellar models with an extensive nuclear network. In
the ﬁrst step stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis is followed from the ini-
tial hydrogen burning up to the presupernova models. The post-supernova
treatment then includes the passage of a neutrino ﬂuence through the outer
layers of the star, followed by the shock wave which heats the material and
also induces noticeable nucleosynthesis, mainly by photodissociation (the γ
process). Modelling of the shock heating is quite essential as the associated
γ process destroys many of the daughter nuclides previously produced by
neutrino nucleosynthesis.

Pulsars as Probes of Relativistic Gravity,
Nuclear Matter, and Astrophysical Plasmas
James M. Cordes

1 Introduction
Pulsars are rotating neutron stars (NSs) that provide unique information
about their interiors, about the relativistic plasma physics of their magne-
tospheres, and about the intervening media through which pulses emitted by
these objects must propagate. NS spins represent the clock mechanism that
underlies usage of pulsars as precise timekeepers for their motions. This last
topic is the ﬁnal aim of this chapter, namely using pulsars to probe gravity
in binary stellar systems — particularly those involving a pulsar and another
compact star (white dwarf [WD], NS, or black hole [BH])— and also to probe
gravitational wave backgrounds that aﬀect the location of both the pulsar and
the Earth. Pulsars also provide exquisite opportunities for probing neutron
stars and their magnetospheres through a variety of techniques.
To set the stage, I will describe the historical and scientiﬁc background
and the phenomenology needed to understand the capabilities and limitations
of using pulsars as clocks. The four main sections of this chapter are:
1. Pulsar basics that are relevant to their use as laboratories.
2. Pulsar populations in the Milky Way Galaxy, their high velocities and
mechanisms for inducing them, and modeling the interstellar medium
(ISM) using pulsars;
3. Pulsar surveys and how they will yield rare objects that can serve as
gravitational laboratories;
4. Using pulsar timing to probe gravity and the internal workings of neutron
stars.
The chapter ﬁnishes with a list of “big questions” that deﬁne the forefront of
NS and related science.
The reader is referred to other recent articles that discuss in greater detail
some of the topics presented here, including the tremendous capabilities of the
next generation radio telescope, the Square Kilometer Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
and books on compact objects [7, 8].

2 Neutron Stars’ Greatest Hits
Since the pulsar discovery in 1967 [9], neutron star astronomy has provided
many discoveries and important insights into the way stars evolve, and pro-
vided opportunities for probing nuclear matter and making precision measure-
ments of neutron star masses and constraints on relativistic gravity. A short
list of important milestones in this history includes:
1. 1967: Discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell, Tony Hewish et al. using a
radio array telescope designed to ﬁnd compact radio sources that displayed
interplanetary scintillation [9].
2. 1967: Discovery of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the Vela satellite net-
work, whose purpose was to detect gamma-rays from nuclear explosions.
GRBs were unannounced until 1973 [10].
3. 1968: Discovery of the pulsar in the Crab Nebula and measurement of the
secular increase in spin period, verifying a prediction by T. Gold about
the spinning NS concept [11, 12, 13].
4. 1969: Detection of a rapid spinup in the Vela pulsar [14], signifying that
the NS interior contained neutrons in a superﬂuid state.
5. 1973: Nobel Prize in Physics to A. Hewish for the discovery of pulsars.
6. 1974: Discovery of the ﬁrst binary pulsar, B1913+16, with a NS companion
in an 8-hr orbit [15].
7. 1979: The March 5, 1979 gamma-ray burst event from a source in the Large
Magellanic Cloud was detected by many satellites. The source turned out
to be the ﬁrst soft-gamma repeater (SGR), now recognized to be a NS
with very large magnetic ﬁeld, a magnetar.
8. 1982: Discovery of the ﬁrst millisecond pulsar, B1937+21, with a period
of 1.56 ms [16].
9. 1992: Discovery of the ﬁrst extrasolar planets. Remarkably, these orbit a
millisecond pulsar and were identiﬁed using pulse timing methods [17].
10. 1993: Nobel Prize to R. Hulse and J. Taylor for the discovery of the
binary neutron star system containing the pulsar B1913+16, which led
to a demonstration that gravitational waves are emitted by the system in
accord with Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity.
11. 1990s-2000s: Identiﬁcation of pulsars as a runaway population through
constraints on their space velocity distribution and discovery of an indi-
vidual object moving fast enough to escape the Galaxy. About 50% of the
pulsar population will escape [18, 19].
12. 2003: Discovery of the ﬁrst double pulsar [20], J0737−3939, a 2.4 hr binary
with a relatively slow, 2.8 s pulsar and an old, recycled pulsar with 23 ms
period. This system is the best gravitational laboratory so far, showing
GR apsidal advance of 17 deg yr−1 as compared to Mercury’s ∼43 arc
sec century−1.
13. 2004: A giant ﬂare from the magnetar SGR 1806–20 on 27 December
2004 induced an ionospheric perturbation comparable to that produced

45
by the Sun, even though the object is halfway across the Milky Way
Galaxy [21, 22, 23].
14. 2005: Analysis of the short-duration GRB 050709 and its afterglow, sug-
gesting a lower total event energy and a location oﬀset from the source’s
birth galaxy, consistent with a merger event of two NS or a NS and a
black hole [24].
3 Pulsar Basics
Pulsars are important in physics and astrophysics because they serve as
(1) Laboratories for gravity near the strong ﬁeld limit, especially binary
pulsars with NS or BH companions in compact orbits with orbital periods
of a few hours or less;
(2) Gravitational wave detectors of long-wavelength gravitational waves
(wavelengths ∼light-years);
(3) Fossil information for the physics of core-collapse supernovae via their
characteristic high velocities in the Galaxy;
(4) Venues for nonlinear, relativistic plasma physics; and
(5) Probes of the interstellar medium, including magnetic ﬁelds and tur-
bulence and as a foreground through which we view the radio universe.
In order to understand and use NS as gravitational laboratories, etc., we need
to understand a great deal of pulsar phenomenology.
3.1 Who Discovered Neutron Stars?
It is well known that Baade and Zwicky hypothesized, in 1933, the existence
of neutron stars as remnant cores of stars that explode as supernovae and
they did so only one year after the neutron itself was discovered by Chadwick
and only two years after Chandrasekhar published an analysis of the limiting
mass for white dwarf (WD) stars. Contributing to this fast pace of events
were the models for neutron stars by Oppenheimer and his colleagues in the
late 1930s that incorporated General Relativity. Then followed nearly thirty
years of “dark ages” until pulsars were discovered by accident by Jocelyn
Bell and Tony Hewish using a low-frequency array telescope near Cambridge,
UK. Since the 1967 discovery of pulsars there has been a virtual explosion
of activity over the entire electromagnetic spectrum and also neutrino and
gravitational wave detectors.
However, this synopsis begs the question that heads this section. Directly
or indirectly who, indeed, discovered neutron stars? I think great credit should
be given to the Chinese and Native Americans. The Chinese detected — and
recorded — the explosion of the star on July 4, 1054 that became the Crab

46
J. Cordes
Nebula and left behind a rapidly rotating neutron star, the Crab pulsar, that
was discovered in 1968, 954 years after the Chinese observations. Chinese
records indicate that the explosion was visible for 23 days during daytime and
were able to monitor it for 653 days until it became invisible to the naked eye.
Less quantitatively but equally dramatic is the pictograph from the Anasazis
in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico that shows a bright star near a cresent moon
that is consistent with the lunar phase on the dates given by the Chinese.
The Crab Nebula itself was discovered by Charles Messier in 1758, be-
coming the ﬁrst entry in his catalog of “uninteresting” nebulous objects to be
avoided if you were a serious searcher of comets. The Crab appellation was
given by Lord Rosse in 1844. In modern times both the Crab nebula and its
pulsar have been the targets of thousands of astronomical observations. While
sometimes considered Rosetta stones for supernova remnants and pulsars ow-
ing to the large body of empirical data and their easy detection across the
electromagnetic spectrum, both may be anomalous and thus not representa-
tive of their object classes.
3.2 Endstates of Stellar Evolution
The cores of ordinary stars — by which we mean main sequence stars in whose
centers hydrogen is fused to helium — eventually collapse because gravity
wins the tug of war it has with gas pressure. What then happens depends
on the mass of the collapsing core. For low-enough masses, the collapse is
halted by degeneracy pressure. This pressure arises from the Pauli exclusion
principle for fermions, which states that no two particles may have the same
quantum state, and which may be viewed in terms of the uncertainty principle,
∆x∆p ≥ℏ. Gravitational collapse requires non-zero particle momenta and,
hence, pressure that exceeds that associated with random thermal motions.
When particles become relativistic, the star cannot ﬁnd an equilibrium state
at ﬁnite radius. Low mass cores become white dwarf stars while intermediate
masses become neutron stars supported, respectively, by degenerate electron
and degenerate neutron pressure. The Chandrasekhar mass is the maximum
mass that can be supported and depends on the mean particle mass and is
in the ballpark of 1 M⊙for white dwarfs and ∼1.4 to 2 M⊙for NSs. The
uncertainty on the maximum NS mass is both theoretical and empirical, the
former because of our lack of precise knowledge about the equation of state of
nuclear matter, the latter because of residual model dependences on inferences
from binary pulsar timing observations. Still larger masses lead to black holes.
While the three mass regimes for WDs, NSs and BHs are deﬁned primar-
ily with respect to fundamental constants and secondarily to composition,
astrophysical factors complexify how the original masses of progenitor main
sequence stars lead to particular compact objects. These are associated with
the fact that most stars are born in multiple star systems (binary, triple stars,
etc.). During the evolution of a binary, for example, mass exchange can take

Gravity and Nuclear Matter with Pulsars
47
place as one of the stars evolves oﬀthe main sequence and later its compan-
ion. In suﬃciently compact systems, mass exchange can change the ultimate
endstate from a WD to a NS, for example, of the acceptor object if it receives
a signiﬁcant amount of mass. Some binaries are disrupted if the more massive,
faster-evolving object explodes as a supernova and carries away suﬃcient en-
ergy to unbind the system. Others become unbound after a second explosion.
Those massive, rare binaries that remain bound and are compact will inspiral
owing to energy loss from gravitational wave emission, ultimately leading to
a gravitational catastrophe associated with the merger of the two stars.
3.3 Why Pulsars are Highly Magnetized Neutron Stars
Radio pulsars were discovered by accident during a survey of the sky at
81 MHz (just below the FM band) whose goal was to identify compact
quasi-stellar objects that displayed interplanetary scintillation1. The key
technical element of the survey that allowed the discovery of pulsars was
high time resolution of less than one second, an unprecedented short time
scale for astronomical samples. On a human level, it was the persistence of
Jocelyn Bell in pursuing the origin of the “bit of scruﬀ” on literally miles of
chart recordings that led to the discovery.
In a pulsar, radio pulsations are caused by the rotation of the NS, which
swings a beam of radiation into and out of the line of sight to the observer. This
light house model emerged in the late 1960s as the overwhelmingly favored
picture for the pulsar phenomenon for the following reasons:
1. Other causes of the periodicity, such as radial vibrations of a star or
orbital motion, were not fast enough to account for the range of periods
seen. Moreover, the increase of the pulse period with time was much more
readily explainable as the spindown of a rotating object. Decaying orbital
motion would lead to a decrease in pulse period, contrary to observation.
2. The energetics of spindown were consistent with the rate at which energy
is pumped into the surroundings of the Crab pulsar [25].
Stability of Spinning Objects
Some simple calculations can verify these statements. First, consider the sta-
bility of a spinning object, by analyzing the forces on a test mass m on the
surface of a star of mass M, radius R∗and angular spin frequency Ω. To stay
bound, the gravitational force must exceed the centrifugal force:
1 IPS is a propagation eﬀect similar to the twinkling of optical starlight. Twinkling
is caused by turbulent, refractive index variations in the Earth’s atmosphere as-
sociated with temperature variations on spatial scales ∼1 cm. Refractive index
variations in the ionized solar wind (a.k.a. the interplanetary medium) are caused
by turbulent electron density variations.

Table 1 evaluates this expression for several pulsars and compares the implied
density lower bounds with densities of ordinary stars and WDs. While the
ﬁrst pulsar discovery could have been accounted for by a spinning WD, the
discovery of the Crab pulsar ruled out spinning WDs and the discovery of
the ﬁrst millisecond pulsar, B1937+21, implied a mean density comparable to
that of an atomic nucleus.

Spindown, Magnetic Torques and the Braking Index
A second calculation yields the spindown energy loss rate and relates it to the
surface magnetic ﬁeld. We assume that the neutron star is highly conducting
and that a dipolar magnetic ﬁeld is frozen into it. For a magnetic moment m
inclined at an angle α from the spin axis, the energy loss rate from magnetic
dipole radiation (MDR) is
˙EMDR = IΩ˙Ω= 2|m|2Ω4 sin2 α
3c3
,
where Ωis the spin frequency and ˙Ωis its time derivative. Both quantities are
observables that are derived readily from pulsar timing measurements. The
moment of inertia is I = 1045I45 gm cm2 typical of NS models to within a
factor of two. The surface magnetic ﬁeld B is

P ˙P−15

.
where the temporal period derivative ˙P = 10−15 s s−1 ˙P−15. It was well known
before the discovery of pulsars that the Crab Nebula’s expansion was acceler-
ating and energy input was needed at the level ∼1038 erg s−1. With P = 0.33s
and ˙P−15 = 422.7, the implied ˙E accounts for that needed to drive the accel-
eration.
The characteristic time scale for spindown is given by
τS =
Ω
2| ˙Ω|
= P
2 ˙P
,
which is related to the chronological age t by
t = τS
$
1 −(P0/P)n−1%
.
If a pulsar was born spinning with a period P0 ≪P then the characteristic
and chronological time scales are nearly identical. How does this work for
the Crab pulsar? The Crab Nebula and pulsar were born in 1054 AD, so
their chronological age of 952 yr (in 2006) is smaller than the spindown age,
τS = 1239 yr, calculated from current spindown parameters. If the Crab pulsar
was born with P0 a non-negligible fraction of its present period, the spindown
time can be reconciled with the true age. However, there are likely to be other
factors, such as non-constancy of the braking index or time-variation of the
magnetic ﬁeld.
Do pulsars really spin down in accordance with MDR? The short answer
is no. But one must qualify this by stating that the implied torques are not
really all that diﬀerent from what we expect from MDR. We generalize the
spindown law by writing
˙Ω= kΩΩn,
where kΩis a coeﬃcient that may or may not depend on time and n is the
braking index. For MDR, n = 3. Detailed measurements of a few pulsars,
particularly young, highly magnetized pulsars with large Ωand large ˙Ω, it
is also possible to measure the second derivative, ¨Ω. If we assume that kΩis
time independent, then the braking index is
ˆn = Ω¨Ω
˙Ω2 ,
where the caret signiﬁes that the value obtained is merely an estimate, which
may not equal the true braking index. What has been found is that ˆn ≈2.5
for a few objects and ˆn ≈1.1 for the Vela pulsar.
Such values of n can be interpreted in various ways. First, they are not all
that diﬀerent from n = 3 for MDR. That suggests that the use of the MDR
formula to estimate surface magnetic ﬁelds may be ok. Second, the diﬀerences
from n = 3 may result from several factors, including

50
J. Cordes
1. The true braking index may be diﬀerent from n = 3 if there are other
contributions to ˙E that combine with the magnetic torque. Examples are
mass loss from a wind or gravitational radiation.
2. The coeﬃcient kΩmay vary with time. If so, then
ˆn = n + (n −1)τS
τk
,
where τk ≡−˙k/¨k. For n > 1, a decaying (growing) coeﬃcient yields ˆn > n
(ˆn < n). At present, there is conﬂicting evidence about whether magnetic
ﬁelds decay on time scales that are relevant to the lifetimes of pulsars.
3. The size of the magnetosphere inﬂuences the torque mechanism, as the
ﬁnite size of the conducting region relative to the light cylinder radius
(deﬁned below) can reduce the apparent braking index to values < 3 [26]
. The braking index is n ∼2 for a very short-period pulsar and asymptotes
to n = 3 as the pulsar spins down.
4. Internal torques involving interactions between the crust and a more fastly
rotating superﬂuid can alter the eﬀective moment of inertia of the crust as
well as transferring angular momentum from the superﬂuid to the crust.
5. Pulsars that show X-ray jets such as the Crab and Vela pulsars may also
have conducting equatorial disks that alter the spindown torques, tending
to reduce the braking index [27].
It is possible that there are other contributions to the torque besides losses
from MDR. Internal torques from interactions with a more fastly-rotating neu-
tron superﬂuid are thought to underly glitches [28], which appear as sudden
spinups of the pulsar. An additional external torque may arise from any in-
ﬂux of neutral material into the magnetosphere. Cheng [29] writes the total
spindown energy loss as
˙Etotal = ˙EMDR + Ω4B2R6
c3
 I∗


,
where the ﬁrst term is the contribution from low-frequency dipole radiation
and the second term results from the torque exerted by magnetospheric cur-
rents; I∗is the actual current and IGJ is the Goldreich-Julian current [30],
the integral over the magnetic polar cap of the current −cΩ· B/2πc that is
implied if the magnetosphere is nearly “force free.” External gains in Cheng’s
model contribute to the current ﬂow and thus alter the energy loss rate from
that expected purely from MDR.
3.4 Manifestations of Neutron Stars
Originally, in the 1930s, the prospects appeared slim for detecting neutron
stars because the envisioned method was to detect thermal X-rays from the
blackbody emission from a hot neutron star. The small radius of a a neutron
star (∼10 km) worked against the success of such a plan, at least at those

Gravity and Nuclear Matter with Pulsars
51
times. As discussed, neutron stars were ﬁrst detected by accident through ra-
dio emission from their magnetospheres. Only later in the 1960s were neutron
stars detected in X-rays and that was from magnetospheric emission or from
hot, accreting gas, not surface blackbody radiation, A short list of the ways
in which neutron stars have been detected is:
1. Rotation-driven pulsars: Radiation has been seen across the entire
electromagnetic spectrum from the Crab pulsar that derives from spin
energy losses. How the spin energy is converted to photons is not well un-
derstood but involves radiation that appears to be coupled to the magnetic
ﬁeld, as in curvature and synchrotron radiation. Inverse Compton radia-
tion may also contribute to high-energy emission. Radio emission is nec-
essarily coherent, i.e. the intensity levels seen require collective radiation
rather than randomly superposed radiation from independent electrons.
2. Accretion driven pulsars: NS in binary systems usually accrete mate-
rial from a companion star at one or more stages. The X-ray luminosity
is LX = ε ˙Mc2, where
˙M is the accretion rate and ε ≈0.1 is an eﬃciency
factor. Gas falling into the magnetosphere, if free falling, would approach
a few tenths of the speed of light. Collisional heating drives the gas to
X-ray emitting temperatures. Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB) are NS
with stellar companions that typically will form a WD. High-mass X-ray
binaries are NS and BH with companions that also will eventually form
another NS or BH.
3. Magnetic-driven emission from Magnetars: some objects appear to
radiate from dissipation of magnetic energy rather than spin or accretion
energy. Magnetars radiate pulsed X-rays in excess of their spin energy
loss rates, ˙E and generally appear to be isolated (as opposed to binary)
objects. Such emission may derive from heating of the NS crust from
dissipation of magnetic energy. Energetic bursts from anomalous X-ray
pulsars (AXPs) and soft-gamma repeaters (SGRs) probably derive from
crust quakes driven by magnetic stresses.
4. Gamma-ray emission from gravitational catastrophes: We have
known for many years that some NS will spiral-in and coalesce with their
companions (WD, NS or BH) on time scales ∼108 yr. A notable exam-
ple is the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar. What happens during coalescence?
During the 1990s people thought that inspiraling NS-NS, NS-BH or BH-
BH binaries might account for most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However
localization of the longer GRB events (≫sec) and linking their afterglows
with star-forming regions in galaxies and association of a few GRBs with
extragalactic supernovae suggests that such GRBs are associated with
hypernovae. A hypernova is an explosion that appears to involve energy
releases larger than that of a canonical Type II supernova (1051 erg in
baryonic matter and photons, 1053 erg in neutrinos). There may yet be
a role for coalescences in the GRB story, however. Short-duration bursts
may in fact be associated with coalescences, an idea that receives support

52
J. Cordes
from the recent discovery of a burst source well outside the conﬁnes of an
optical galaxy. Coalescing binaries will have high space velocities due to
momentum kicks imparted by the explosions that produced the compact
objects and will either oscillate to large distances from their host galaxy
or escape the galaxy altogether (particularly at high redshift when galax-
ies tended to have lower masses). Detection of gravitational waves from
merging binaries is to be expected in the not-too-distant future, perhaps
when LIGO II comes on line or when LISA is launched.
3.5 Pulsar Classes
The distribution of pulsars vs. P and ˙P in the so-called “P −˙P” diagram
allows us to identify groupings that reﬂect the formation and evolution of NS.
1. Canonical pulsars: These pulsars, like those ﬁrst discovered, have present-
day spin periods ranging from tens of milliseconds to 8 s and surface
magnetic ﬁeld strengths B ∼1012±1 G. They are often thought to be
born with periods ∼10 ms, though evidence suggests that some objects
are born with periods longer than 0.1 s. In the standard picture of NS
formation, all pulsars start as canonical pulsars. In the P −˙P diagram of
Fig. 1 most of these pulsars are located at P ∼1s and ˙P ∼10−15. Young
pulsars are especially important members of this class as they are associ-
ated with supernova remnants and often show large numbers of glitches.
2. Modestly recycled pulsars: are objects in binaries that survived a ﬁrst SN
explosion and subsequently accreted matter that spun-up the pulsar and
reduced the eﬀective dipolar component of the magnetic ﬁeld. Accretion is
terminated in these objects by a second supernova explosion that usually,
but not always, unbinds the binary. Those that survive are seen today as
relativistic NS-NS binaries. Evolutionarily, it is possible that some surviv-
ing binaries include black-hole companions. In the P −˙P diagram of Fig. 1
these pulsars are typically located around P ∼30 ms and ˙P ∼10−18.
3. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs): objects in binaries that survive the ﬁrst SN
explosion and in which the companion object eventually evolves into a
white dwarf. The long preceding accretion spins the pulsar up to millisec-
ond periods while attenuating the (apparent) dipolar ﬁeld component to
108 −109 G. The consequent small spin-down rates seem to underly the
high timing precision of these objects and imply spin-down time scales
that often exceed a Hubble time. In the P −˙P diagram (Fig. 1) these pul-
sars are typically located around P ∼5 ms and ˙P ∼10−20. Evolutionary
scenarios that produce recycled pulsars and MSPs are discussed in [31].
4. Strong-magnetic-ﬁeld pulsars: Recently discovered radio pulsars have in-
ferred ﬁelds ∼> 1014 G [32, 33], rivalling those inferred for “magnetar”
objects identiﬁed through their X-and-γ radiation that seems to derive
from non-rotational sources of energy. The relationship between magne-
tars and these high-ﬁeld radio emitting pulsars, whose radiation derives

that have
˙P > 0 and S400 > 1 mJy kpc2. Pulsars in the largest grouping have
surface magnetic ﬁeld strengths ∼1012±1 Gauss. Objects in the bottom left quadrant
are “recycled” pulsars, many of which are in binary systems (designated by circles
around the points) and have ﬁeld strengths ∼109 Gauss. As pulsars spin down they
move downward toward the right such that ˙P ∝P 2−n where n is the braking index
(see text). The spinup line is an estimate of the asymptotic spin state that a pulsar
can reach as it spins up from accretion. The death line signiﬁes the empirical fact
that pulsars either become much weaker or shut oﬀentirely in their radio emission
as they age. Bottom: A 3D plot that adds a luminosity axis to the P −˙P plane.
The third axis is actually the “pseudo-luminosity” commonly used in radio pulsar
studies, Lp = S400D2, where S400 is the time-averaged ﬂux density at 400 MHz and
D is the distance in kpc. The distribution of Lp indicates that the most luminous
pulsars are at intermediate spin periods and that pulsars become dimmer before
they reach the death line region.

solely from spin energy, is not yet known. In the P −˙P diagram of Fig. 1
these radio pulsars are typically located around P ∼5 s and ˙P ∼10−13.
Death or Dearth Line?
There is clearly a dearth of pulsars in the bottom right corner of the P −˙P
diagram. Some pulsar surveys discriminate against long-period objects in the
signal processing. Also, longer period pulsars have narrower beams and thus a
smaller beaming fraction, deﬁned as the fraction of objects whose beams will
intersect the line of sight. Nonetheless, selection eﬀects alone cannot explain
the deﬁcit of longer period pulsars. One explanation for the dearth is that the
e± cascade thought to be required for radio emission (see below) cannot be
sustained for long periods and/or small magnetic ﬁelds (and hence small ˙Ps).
The bounding line is not unlike that drawn in Figure 1 but one needs to invoke
surface magnetic ﬁeld topologies that have much smaller radii of curvature
near the magnetic axis than does a dipolar ﬁeld. Such may be accounted
for by higher-order multipolar components near the surface. However, the
distribution of pulsars does not conform to that expected if there is a bona
ﬁde threshold eﬀect that is the same for all pulsars. Pulsars pile up at longer
periods because ˙P ∝P 2−n ∼P −1/2 whereas the peak density of pulsars in the
P −˙P plane is well to the left of the drawn death line. Rather than shutting oﬀ
suddenly, pulsars may simply fade out as the spin energy available for driving
radiation wanes. This interpretation is consistent with the fact that the radio
luminosity becomes a sizable fraction of ˙E for long-period objects [19]. Thus
the nearly empty region in the lower-right of the P −˙P diagram may simply
result from fading away of the radio luminosity rather than a dramatic shutoﬀ.
Spinup Line for Recycled Pulsars
NSs that remain bound in a binary after the supernova explosion that formed
them often accrete material as their companions expand and overﬂow their
Roche lobes. Accreting material produces X-ray emission and also carries
angular momentum that spins up the NS because the angular momenta in
the system will have aligned in the pre-supernova stages. Accreting material
eﬀectively applies a torque to the NS at the Alfven radius deﬁned by balance
of magnetic and gas pressure. Once the NS spins faster than the Keplerian
orbital speed at this radius, the accretion will no longer spin up the star. This
constitutes the spinup line, the asymptotic period that a NS can reach as
it moves across the P −˙P plane to shorter periods. Another consequence of
accretion is attenuation of the eﬀective dipolar ﬁeld strength, which may arise
from burial and dissipation of the ﬁeld or by reconﬁguration of the magnetic
ﬁeld topology. These eﬀects appear to account for the existence and spin
properties of millisecond pulsars. That recycling can turn on radio emission
as a pulsar recrosses the death-line region implies that the “death” process is

reversible and does not involve dissipation of consumables, such as particular
elements on the surface of the NS.
Many but not all MSPs are currently in binary systems with WD compan-
ions. The most economical explanation for the existence of isolated MSPs is
that the re-activated pulsar energy loss evaporates its companion, a process
that is ongoing in the MSP B1957+20. Theoretical work has trouble obtaining
short-enough evaporation time scales so there appears to be some mechanism
that enhances the evaporation rate.
3.6 Pulsar Magnetospheres
Neutron stars have gravitational ﬁelds ∼1011 larger than Earth’s. However,
canonical pulsars (1012 Gauss with 1-s spin periods) induce electric forces that
are 109 larger than gravity.
Figure 2 shows cartoons of pulsar magnetospheres and particle acceleration
regions inspired by [30, 34] along with a semi-realistic display of the radio
beam pattern. Key elements of the magnetosphere include:
1. Light Cylinder (LC): The surface where the corotation velocity would be
c is given by RLC = c/Ω= cP/2π = 109.68 cm.
2. Dipolar Magnetic Field: Much work is consistent with the dominant ﬁeld
structure being dipolar. Spindown is dominated by the dipolar component
because relevant torques are applied at the LC at radius rLC ≫R∗. Radio
polarization measurements probe the structure of the magnetosphere and
indicate in some cases that the topology at radii where conal radio emis-
sion originates is close to dipolar in form. However, some pulsars show
departures from the dipolar form either in polarization measurements or
in the appearance of “extra” pulse components. Magnetospheric physics
indicates that the topology should include a toroidal component near the
LC because of ﬁeld line inertia.
3. Closed Magnetosphere: Field lines that close within the LC are nearly
equipotentials and thus do not support particle acceleration.
4. Open Field Line Region: The open ﬁeld lines extend through the LC
and reconnect through unknown, complex topologies. Particle accelera-
tion takes place because the ﬁeld lines are not equipotentials.
5. Magnetic Polar Cap: The foot of the last open ﬁeld line bordering the
closed magnetosphere is at an angle θPC relative to the dipole axis given by
sin θPC = (R∗/rLC)1/2. For large enough P, the diameter of the magnetic
polar cap is
2θPC ≈2(R∗/rLC)1/2 ≈1.66◦P −1/2

pulse components include core and cone components [35]. Core emission
(Fig. 2) has an angular width comparable to 2θPC and so probably orig-
inates close to the NS surface. For a dipolar ﬁeld, the opening angle of
the open ﬁeld line region at radius rem is a factor (rem/R∗)1/2 larger
than the polar cap size, thus yielding pulse widths (in angular units)
W = 1.66◦P −1/2 (rem/10 km)1/2. Rankin [36] determined a scaling law
for core beam widths ∼2.45◦P −1/2 by investigating observed pulse shapes
and taking into account orientation angles of spin and dipole axes relative
to the line of sight. Taken at face value, this suggests an emission alti-
tude of 22 km or about two stellar radii for R∗= 10 km. Alternatively,
NS radii could be larger than 10 km if the equation of state is relatively
hard; however, other constraints and considerations suggest that 10 km
is a good estimate for R∗. It is also recognized that gravitational bending
of ray paths plays a role both in the beaming of outgoing radiation and
in the pair production cascade that also depends on photon trajectories.
Conal emission is signiﬁcantly broader than core emission and is likely
produced at many NS radii (10 to 100) above the surface. Rankin [35]
argues convincingly that there are probably two, essentially conal beams
that vary in relative strength for diﬀerent pulsars.
7. Outer gap emission: an outer acceleration region is associated with the null
surface where Ω· B = 0 and the Goldreich-Julian charge density needed
to short-out parallel electric ﬁelds would vanish. Such a region is unsta-
ble and thus gives rise to parallel ﬁelds that can accelerate particles. The
implied beam components and, thus, pulse components are skewed in an-
gle and pulse phase, respectively, from polar-cap components. Outer-gap
components appear to underly high-energy and other non-radio emission
from the Crab and Vela pulsars and a few other objects. Interestingly,
a few objects show “giant” radio pulses that align with the high-energy
components. These objects include the Crab pulsar (P = 0.033 s) and
the MSP B1937+21 (P = 1.56 ms), which have drastically diﬀerent light
cylinder sizes and surface magnetic ﬁeld strengths but, remarkably, have
nearly identical magnetic ﬁeld strengths at their light cylinders if we as-
sume a dipolar scaling ∝r−3.
4 Pulsar Distances, Velocities and Kicks
Pulsars were ﬁrst recognized to be a high-velocity population by Gunn and
Ostriker in 1970 [53]. Since then our knowledge of NS kinematics has grown
enormously owing to empirical work on the pulsar distance scale and on proper
motion measurements and other measures of pulsar velocities.
As shown in Table 4, pulsar distances have been measured directly through
parallax determinations using pulse timing or interferometry. Associations of
pulsars with supernova remnants and other objects yield additional distances.

magnetized neutron star with dipole moment skewed from the rotation axis. The
light cylinder with radius c/Ω= cP/2π deﬁnes the boundary between the open
and closed portion of the magnetosphere by the last ﬁeld line that closes inside it.
Radio emission is thought to arise from the relativistic particle ﬂow along the open
ﬁeld lines near the dipole axis. Some radio emission may originate from additional
acceleration regions that are associated with a surface deﬁned by Ω· B = 0, the so
called “outer gap” regions. Top right: Detail of activity at the surface of the neutron
star according to the picture of [34]. The size of the magnetic polar cap is as shown.
Boundary conditions at the NS surface and at the last closed-ﬁeld-line surface require
E · Bne0, thus leading to acceleration of particles. Under conditions that require
large Ωand/or large B, an electron-positron (e±) cascade can be sustained that
drives a two-stream instability, which provides coherent radio emission. Turn-oﬀof
the cascade may account for the “death line” in the P −˙P diagram. Bottom left:
Field line structure near the neutron star. The open ﬁeld lines (those that do not

a typical pulsar, showing an inner core and outer, hollow-cone beam component. The
strengths of these components appear to depend on P and possibly on ˙P. Additional
components are needed for some pulsars, including a second hollow-cone component
and components associated with outer-gap emission regions.

Atomic hydrogen (HI) absorption at 21 cm wavelength combined with a kine-
matic model for Galactic rotation yields distance constraints. By far, most
pulsar distances are obtained using the dispersion measure combined with a
Galactic model for the electron density.

The distance scale is obviously important for establishing luminosities of
pulsars across the electromagnetic spectrum. More importantly, good distance
estimates are needed to correct pulsar timing measurements for acceleration
eﬀects that are a function of distance, such as the Shklovsky eﬀect2 and Galac-
tic acceleration. These contribute terms to pulse arrival times that are covari-
ant with the long-term evolution of compact orbits and thus aﬀect GR tests.
Recent very long baseline interferometry [47, 48, 50, 49, 51] has yielded
important new parallax measurements and over the next few years, a large
number of parallaxes should emerge. Parallaxes provide anchor points for
electron density models for the Galaxy which then can be used to the much
larger sample of pulsars where parallaxes are lacking.

even if the pulse period is intrinsically steady. This simple geometric eﬀect arises
because the distance to the pulsar steadily increases with time. Note that the
motion along the line of sight is already absorbed into the nominal period.

4.1 Dispersion Measure Distances
The dispersion measure (DM) is the observable for estimating pulsar distances
that is obtained routinely for all radio pulsars. Figure 3 shows a single pulse
from the Crab pulsar that displays diﬀerential time of arrival (TOA) vs. fre-
quency. Pulsed ﬂux evidently is emitted simultaneously (or nearly so) at the
pulsar, so the systematic variation with frequency is caused by propagation
through the interstellar plasma.
The plasma frequency in the ISM νp ≈1.56 kHz (ne/0.03 cm−3)1/2 and the
gyrofrequency νB ≈2.8 HzBµG. Magnetic ﬁelds introduce birefringence that
is most easily detected as Faraday rotation. The index of refraction in a cold
magnetized plasma like the ISM for ν ≫νp and ν ≫νB∥is (e.g. Thomson,

The frequency dependent time delay is calculated by integrating (group

t = tDM ± tRM.

The variation of TOA vs ν is thus TOA(ν) ∝DMν−2, so multifrequency
TOA measurements readily yield DM. An electron density model such as
NE2001 [52] can be used to invert the integral that deﬁnes DM. Such distances
are on average good to perhaps 25%. However, any given pulsar can be nearer
or farther by factors of two owing to ﬁne-scale structure in the ionized ISM.
4.2 Pulsar Space Velocities
Proper motions of pulsars (their angular motion on the sky) have been mea-
sured using the same techniques as for parallaxes (see Table 4). Work over
the last 10 years has reﬁned the original conclusion by Gunn and Ostriker [53]
that pulsars are a “runaway” population. Speciﬁcally, we know that

Fig. 3. Plot of intensity against time and frequency, showing a single dispersed
pulse as it arrives at diﬀerent frequencies centered at 0.43 GHz. The right-hand
panel shows the pulse amplitude vs. frequency while the bottom panel shows the
pulse shape with and without compensating for dispersion delays. This pulse is the
largest in one hour of data, has S/N ∼1.1 × 104, and a pulse peak that is 130
times the ﬂux density of the Crab Nebula, or ∼155 kJy. Note that the segments
at either end of the bandpass where the pulse arrival time is opposite the trend at
most frequencies is caused by aliasing of the signal.
1. Canonical (∼1012 Gauss) pulsars have a mean 3D peculiar speed (adding
to Galactic rotation) ∼400-500 km −1 [18, 54, 19, 55]. For comparison,
solar-type stars have rms peculiar speeds ∼10 km s−1 and so-called OB
runaways have speeds up to ∼100 km s−1.
2. The velocity distribution extends to high velocities (> 103 km s−1) [51].
3. The velocity distribution is inferred to be bimodal [54, 19] with a low
velocity component ∼100 km s−1 and high velocity component ∼500 km
s−1. Selection biases undoubtedly aﬀect both the low-velocity and high-
velocity pulsars. Recent work [55] reports a good ﬁt to the proper motions
of 233 pulsars using only a unimodal, Maxwellian distribution with a 1D
rms ∼265 km s−1. However, this work did not include corrections for

Gravity and Nuclear Matter with Pulsars
61
selection eﬀects. With the increase in source sample and the continued
output of precision parallaxes, a reanalysis that takes into account the
parallax sample as well as the most recent electron density model needs
to be done to improve the inferences about the shape of the velocity
distribution.
4. Millisecond pulsars are a low-velocity population (by pulsar standards):
their typical 3D speed is ∼50-100 km s−1 [56, 55]. Such low speeds are
consistent with a velocity selection eﬀect in the formation of MSPs: such
objects are formed only if their binarity is preserved after the supernova
explosion that formed the NS.
Pulsar Recoils and Kicks
Several processes have been suggested for the large peculiar motions of pulsars.
Here we describe them and report the implied orientation of the velocity and
the spin axis:
1. Recoil from supernova disruption of a binary (Ω⊥V ): Sudden
mass loss from a supernova causes the individual stars in a compact binary
to recoil at high velocities [57]. Blaauw’s original explanation was for OB
runaway stars but also applies to NS formed in binaries.
2. Recoil from evanescent NS binaries (Ω⊥V ): A rapidly rotating
proto-NS may fragment to form a double proto-NS, one of which will lose
mass and explode as it reaches the minimum stable mass. The resulting
explosion in the very compact binary imparts a large recoil velocity to the
surviving NS [61, 62].
3. Natal kicks from asymmetrical supernova explosions (random Ω·
V or Ω∥V with rotational averaging): Momentum thrust(s) occurring
during the ∼1 sec of core collapse can lead to even larger space velocities
than the recoil mechanism. Candidate eﬀects include neutrino and mass
rocket eﬀects associated either with advection in the collapsing core or,
if magnetic ﬁelds are very large (> 1015 Gauss), neutrino asymmetry due
to the magnetic ﬁeld.
4. Slow acceleration after the supernova explosion (Ω∥V ): A mag-
netic dipole oﬀset from the center of a NS would not only spin down the
star but also accelerate the NS translationally [58]. Large enough veloc-
ities require short spin periods at birth (∼1 ms), and a sizable oﬀset, a
few tenths of a NS radius [59].
Several lines of evidence indicate that recoil alone cannot account for the
largest pulsar velocities, requiring either natal kicks or the dipole rocket ef-
fect. Other evidence for favoring natal kicks involves speciﬁc objects for which
either geodetic precession or orbital precession occurs, processes that necessi-
tate there having been a sudden misalignment of the spin and orbital angular
momenta. It is expected that accreting binaries will have aligned angular mo-
menta because the time scales for alignment are relatively short. Geodetic

62
J. Cordes
precession comprises wobble of the spin vector about the total (spin + or-
bital) angular momentum. A pulsar’s magnetic axis and thus its radiation
beam(s) will also wobble, producing secular changes in pulse shape. Such
changes are seen in several of the NS-NS binaries, including the Hulse-Taylor
binary (B1913+16), B1534+12, and the double pulsar, J0737–3939. Statisti-
cally, the small fraction of binary radio pulsars also appears to require kicks in
addition to recoil. Population synthesis studies indicate that too many pulsars
remain in binaries if there is no kick.
Corroborating evidence for natal kicks comes from the orientation of X-
ray jets relative to the proper motions of the Crab and Vela pulsars. X-ray
jets are aligned with the spin axis, thus implying alignment of the velocity
vectors with the spin axes in these objects. Such alignment can occur if the
time scale tkick for the kick process is larger than the spin period P(t) of the
proto-NS, thus inducing spin averaging of the kick force into a direction along
the spin axis [60]. Not all objects show such alignments so either these are
chance alignments or mis-aligning eﬀects occur, like the combination of kicks
from two supernovae in cases where the binary remains bound after the ﬁrst.
Given that natal kicks combine with recoil to produce the net velocity dis-
tribution, it is a bit of a conundrum to explain the evidently bimodal shape
of the velocity distribution. Suppose there are at least two contributions to
the peculiar velocity (kicks + recoil) and there may be multiple kick processes
(neutrino + matter rocket eﬀects). If these processes act independently each
with its own contributing velocity distribution, then the sum of the contribu-
tions should have a distribution that is the convolution of the various distri-
butions. If these are all individually unimodal then so too will be the sum.
The bimodal velocity distribution therefore suggests that the various eﬀects
are not independent. An example would be if kick amplitudes were somehow
inﬂuenced by evolution in binary systems. Another suggestion is that all pul-
sars are not NS but rather some are strange stars that receive kicks from the
phase transition to quark matter [63].
Bow Shocks
As the mean pulsar speed V is highly supersonic and super-Alfv´enic, shocks
are expected at the interface between the pulsar wind and the ISM. The
momentum of the relativistic NS wind is ˙E/c under the assumption that the
spindown energy loss is carried away by the relativistic wind. Balanced with
ISM ram pressure, the stand-oﬀradius is

High resolution images of the region marked with a box (∼16 arcsec in size) were
obtained with the HST PC in 1994 (right) and 2001 (left). North is upward and east
is to the left.
This expression conforms to the observed bow shocks, which are rare ow-
ing to the requirements needed for the pulsar environment in order to see a
detectable tracer, such as Hα emission [64].
Figure 4 shows the Guitar Nebula, a spectacular bow shock seen in Hα.
The length of the nebula corresponds to ∼300 yr of travel. The spindown
age of the pulsar is 106 yr, so it has moved about 1 kpc from its birth site.
The “nose” of the bow shock is unresolvable from the ground because the
small ˙E and large space velocity ∼1600 km s−1 (using the proper motion
and nominal DM distance) imply a small R0. The nose is resolved in Hubble
Space Telescope images, two epochs of which are shown in the ﬁgure, which
demonstrate the secular advance of the bow shock through the ISM. This and
other pulsar bow shocks thus show that (a) the pulsar wind is relativistic and
(b) does not manifest any anisotropy that would aﬀect the bow shock contours;
such anisotropy should exist but evidently is not suﬃcient to be observable
once rotational averaging takes place. In addition, bow shocks corroborate the
velocities inferred for pulsars for which we have only a DM-based distance.

plete” Galactic census for pulsars to be conducted with the SKA. The number of
active radio pulsars in the Galaxy that are detectable in periodicity searches is the
birth rate ∼10−2 yr−1 multiplied by the typical radio lifetime for canonical pulsars
∼107 yr, or ∼105 objects. Of these ∼20% are beamed toward us, yielding ∼2×104
potentially detectable pulsars. Recent work [65] has identiﬁed a population of pul-
sars detectable only or primarily through single-pulse searches; the number of such
“pulsar transients” is comparable to the number detectable in periodicity surveys.
5 Pulsar Surveys
Pulsar surveys have been ongoing since the original 1967 discovery and have
made ever-growing use of innovations in computer technology to increase the
sensitivity. Figure 5 shows the pace of discovery, which is expected to increase
dramatically with the ongoing Arecibo ALFA survey and surveys expected
with the Square Kilometer Array and demonstrator arrays for the SKA, lead-
ing to a full-Galactic census of pulsars.
Why conduct a full pulsar census of the Galaxy? The ﬁrst reason for
proposing a complete Galactic census is obvious: the larger the number of
pulsar detections, the more likely it is to ﬁnd rare objects that provide the
greatest opportunities for use as physical laboratories. These include binary
pulsars as described above and also those with black hole companions; MSPs

Gravity and Nuclear Matter with Pulsars
65
that can be used as detectors of cosmological gravitational waves; MSPs spin-
ning faster than 1.5 ms, possibly as fast as 0.5 ms, that probe the equation-
of-state under extreme conditions; hypervelocity pulsars with translational
speeds in excess of 103 km s−1, which constrain both core-collapse physics
and the gravitational potential of the Milky Way; and objects with unusual
spin properties, such as those showing discontinuities (“glitches”) and appar-
ent precessional motions (including “free” precession in isolated pulsars and
binary pulsars showing geodetic precession).
The second reason for a full Galactic census is that the large number of
pulsars can be used to delineate the advanced stages of stellar evolution that
lead to supernovae and compact objects. In particular, with a large sample
we can determine the branching ratios for the formation of canonical pulsars
and magnetars. We can also estimate the eﬀective birth rates for MSPs and
for those binary pulsars that are likely to coalesce on time scales short enough
to be of interest as sources of periodic, chirped gravitational waves (e.g. [66]).
The third reason is that a maximal pulsar sample can be used to probe
and map the ISM at an unprecedented level of detail. Measurable propaga-
tion eﬀects include dispersion, scattering, Faraday rotation, and HI absorption
that provide, respectively, line-of-sight integrals of the free-electron density
ne, of the ﬂuctuating electron density, δne, of the product B∥ne, where B∥
is the LOS component of the interstellar magnetic ﬁeld, and of the neutral
hydrogen density. The resulting dispersion measures (DM), scattering mea-
sures (SM), rotation measures (RM) and atomic hydrogen column densities
(NHI) obtained for a large number of directions will enable us to construct a
much more detailed map of the Galaxy’s gaseous and magnetic components,
including their ﬂuctuations.
5.1 Where Should We Search?
From the above discussion, the target classes that comprise the forefront are:
1. Sub-millisecond pulsars: Finding any pulsar with P < 0.5 ms would rule
out all current equations of state (EOS) for neutron star matter and would
require the role of strange matter.
2. Slow pulsars: Very slow pulsars (5 to 10 s) require radio pulsars to have
ﬁeld strengths B > 1013 Gauss in order to produce radio emission. We
do not understand the relationship of the few radio pulsars having such
strong ﬁelds with magnetars, X-ray and gamma-ray objects from which
radio emission has not (yet) been detected. What is the longest period at
which we might ﬁnd radio emission?
3. High-velocity pulsars: Selection eﬀects work against ﬁnding the highest
velocities so we do not know what the largest kick is. Finding this out
may help us identify or at least rule out some kick mechanisms.
4. Relativistic binaries: NS-NS and NS-BH binaries should exist with orbital
periods of hours and less. The more compact the orbit, the greater the

I(t, ν), intensity vs. time and frequency that is sampled with resolutions δt ∼100 µs
and δν ∼10−103 kHz. The ﬁrst step is to dedisperse the signal (see text) with trial
values of DM when the DM is not known (which is typical). Next in the periodicity
search is an FFT of the resulting dedispersed time series, followed by trial harmonic
sums, which are thresholded to identify candidate signals. The time series is “folded”
at candidate periods in order to build up a pulse shape, which is then subjected to
additional tests. The acid test in the analysis is to conﬁrm the candidate through
a new observation. The other analysis path for a transient search involves cross-
correlation of dedispersed time series with a set of matched ﬁlters that correspond
to diﬀerent pulse widths. Output correlation functions are subjected to threshold
tests to identify candidate single-pulses.
number of relativistic eﬀects that can be detected and the stronger the
tests of GR. Also, a comprehensive sample of compact binaries allows bet-
ter estimates of the merger rate relevant for GRB studies and for detection
rates for LIGO and other gravitational wave telescopes.

5. Globular clusters: Clusters are proliﬁc factories for recycled pulsars be-
cause the stellar density is high enough that stars can exchange partners
and thus enhance the prospects for recycling. Some globular clusters may
contain medium-mass black holes with orbiting pulsars. Finding them is
challenging but will provide great payoﬀfor testing GR.
6. Pulsars orbiting the massive black hole in the Galactic center: Pulsars
orbiting the 3 × 106 M⊙black hole in the center of the Milky Way are
especially interesting for subsequent pulse timing and tests of GR [67, 69,
68]. The GC is similar to, but much larger than, a globular cluster, so we
expect many recycled pulsars in binaries to exist in the star cluster around
Sgr A*. Presently, no pulsars are known in this region because radio wave
scattering smears the pulses from any pulsar that happens to be there. The
pulse broadening time ∼300 s at a frequency of 1 GHz but scales as ν−4.
Thus a search at ν > 10 GHz can yield pulsars with periods ∼< 0.3 s. Yet
shorter period objects require even higher frequencies. However, pulsar
spectra typically fall oﬀas ν−x with x ≈1.5, so high-frequency surveys
will not detect many, if any, pulsars using existing telescopes. Success in
this area may require the SKA or, at least, an Arecibo-sized telescope
operating in the southern hemisphere.
5.2 Pulsar Search Processing
A two branch ﬂow chart for search processing is shown in Figure 6. The pe-
riodicity search that uses Fourier techniques to identify the periodic signal
has characterized pulsar signals up until now. The transient search branch
assumes nothing about periodicity and simply identiﬁes single pulses in the
time series. Both branches have “dedispersion” in common, which compen-
sates the diﬀerential arrival times due to dispersive propagation (Fig. 3). In
both branches, identiﬁcation of the pulsar signal strives for matched ﬁltering
in order to optimize the signal to noise ratio (S/N) of various test statistics.
The same is true for detection of gravitational waves.
There are two types of dedispersion techniques:
1. Coherent Dedispersion operates on the radio telescope voltage ∝elec-
tric ﬁeld E(t), which contains phase information about the pulsar radia-
tion. The emitted electric ﬁeld is modiﬁed by the phase factor exp(ik(ω)z)
where k(ω) contains DM and other quantities. Dedispersion simply in-
volves multiplication of the FFT of the voltage by the inverse ﬁlter,
exp(−ik(ω)z). Coherent dedispersion is most useful for low-DM pulsars or
for high-frequency observations. The resulting time resolution is 1 / (to-
tal bandwidth) and thus easily can be better than 1 µs. However, another
propagation eﬀect — pulse broadening from interstellar scattering (multi-
path propagation) — may determine the actual time resolution. Coherent
dedispersion is computationally very expensive and is typically used for
precision timing and single-pulse studies rather than in pulsar searching.

A notable example is the nano-second duration shot pulse sub-structure
seen in giant pulses from the Crab pulsar [70].
2. Post-detection Dedispersion is an approximate method that operates
on the “detected” (i.e. squared) voltage and shifts the time series ob-
tained in each of a large number of individual frequency channels. Such
data are obtained with multi-channel spectrometers whose outputs are
recorded at fast intervals (∼100 µs). Dedispersion involves shifting the
intensity I(ν, t) by a time tDM ∝DM/ν2. The example in Figure 3 shows
the dispersed and dedispersed pulse in the bottom panel. This method is
computationally much less demanding than coherent dedispersion. How-
ever, signiﬁcant investment must be made in hardware spectrometers that
have fast recording capabilities.
Dedispersion uses matched ﬁltering of the dispersion signature in the frequency-
time plane. Other aspects of matched ﬁltering for pulsar searches include:
1. Single pulse searches: one must match the shape and the width of the
pulses, neither of which are known in advance.
2. Periodicity searches: the period as well as the pulse shape and width needs
to be matched. An approximation for doing so is harmonic summing,
which involves using partial sums of candidate harmonics in the power
spectrum of the dedispersed time series.
3. Pulsars in compact orbits: acceleration within a binary with orbital period
of a few hours can smear the pulse if uncompensated even for data sets
of duration T of just a few minutes. Optimal S/N mandates a search in
an acceleration parameter for the cases T ≫Porb. For T ∼> Porb, matched
ﬁltering involves a large parameter space, although approximate methods
can reduce the computational load if orbital sidebands are searched as
part of the harmonic summing process [71].
6 Probing Gravity and Neutron Stars with Pulsar
Timing
6.1 Arrival Time Analysis
Pulsar timing is conceptually simple: at an observatory a pulsar’s signal is
processed (i.e. dedisperse and average over some number of pulse periods) to
establish a time of arrival (TOA) for the pulse. Measurements of TOAs over
long periods of time by deﬁnition correspond to integer multiples of pulse
periods separating the TOAs. Through appropriate analysis, one can identify
the many eﬀects that contribute to the TOA, including those within the pulsar
itself, those that arise from binary motion (if any) of the pulsar, interstellar
propagation eﬀects, and those that arise from the observatory’s motion in the
solar system. Added to these are relativistic eﬀects occurring anywhere along
the line of sight. A comprehensive model that accounts for all these eﬀects,

sar B1740+09 [37] with their average at

when ﬁtted to the TOAs, will yield timing residuals that have zero mean,
showing non-zero values only as a result of random measurement errors.
In practice, TOAs are estimated from a measured pulse shape using (again)
matched ﬁltering. This involves a cross correlation of a template ﬁlter, which
is the idealized or long-term-average pulse shape, with the data and identi-
fying the time oﬀset between template and pulse. Such a procedure is based
on the assumption that the pulsar’s pulse shape is invariant with time and
that the only source of random error on the shape is additive. These are only
approximately true. As seen in Figure 7, single pulses show signiﬁcant ampli-
tude ﬂuctuations and phase jitter. These induce N −1/2 ﬂuctuations when N
pulses are combined.
Once a TOA is estimated, it is useful to refer it to an (approximate) inertial
frame, the solar system’s barycenter, as shown in Figure 8. Barycentric TOAs
may then be analyzed with a timing model. The simplest model applies to an
isolated pulsar that spins down smoothly on a time scale much longer (≫103
yr) than the set of TOAs (years). For this case a quadratic or cubic phase
model suﬃces:
φspin(t) = φ0 + νt + 1
2 ˙νt2 + 1
6 ¨νt3,
(7)
where the data are assumed to start at t = 0. For most pulsars, even the
cubic term from spindown is negligible. Figure 9 shows the residual phases
R(t) = φ(t) −nt, where nt is the integer number of periods corresponding
to time t) (expressed as Pδφ(t) in time units) for 14 pulsars. Some objects

show R(T) consistent with random errors while others clearly show large,
correlated residuals. In all of these cases, the excess residuals are caused by
“timing noise,” which appears to be stochastic with a “red” spectrum, mean-
ing that power is concentrated at low ﬂuctuation frequencies. A better name
for this timing noise would be spin noise because it all appears to derive from
activity within the NS, such as crustquakes combined with noisy superﬂuid
interactions with the NS crust. Spin noise correlates with large ˙P and thus
appears to have something to do with the rate at which the crust spins down
in response to the magnetic torque and how the spindown is communicated to
the internal, more fastly rotating superﬂuid. Spin noise is of astrophysical in-
terest in and of itself. However, our discussion here will treat it as a limitation
to how well we can measure other eﬀects, such as gravitational eﬀects.
6.2 Arrival Time Contributions
Contributions to arrival times (or, equivalently, pulse phase) include eﬀects
that are imposed in one or more locations along the line of sight. Ideally, we
would like to estimate the actual emission time te from the TOA or reception
time tr of a pulse:

where the various terms are discussed in detail in [6]. The second line is
the dispersion delay associated with the ISM. The Roemer term is the delay
associated with the separation and relative motion of the observatory and the
solar system barycenter; the Einstein term is associated with the gravitational
redshift and time dilation of the Sun’s (or pulsar companion’s) gravitational
ﬁeld; and the Shapiro delay is associated with the gravitational potential of
the Sun or the pulsar’s companion (if any). Stochastic variations in the TOA
include noise from the ISM, orbital noise from (e.g.) an ensemble of asteroids,
spin noise within the pulsar, and the last term represents variations associated
with gravitational wave backgrounds.

6.3 Binary Pulsars
For pulsars in binary systems, TOAs are used to monitor the pulsar’s orbit
with extrarordinary precision. For some objects, the TOAs can be measured
to a precision of less than 100 ns, though for canonical pulsars, the precision
may be as large as 1 ms. Nature fortunately has conspired to make those
pulsars in the most interesting binary systems — pulsars with white dwarf or
NS companions with orbital periods of hours to days — the objects with the
best TOA precision. This arises because such pulsars are typically recycled
objects with short periods and ﬁeld strengths much smaller than 1011 G. In
a ﬁxed amount of time, there are many more pulses that can be summed to
improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Also low ﬁelds correspond to small values
of ˙P that appear to be associated with low levels of spin noise.
Compact orbits need to be described by General Relativity or some other
gravitational theory. Therefore TOA analysis can be used to test how well GR
works [38, 39] and determine the masses of the orbiting objects. The Shapiro
delay provides a combined determination of the companion’s mass and the
inclination of the orbit, since the eﬀect depends on the impact parameter of
the line of the sight to the pulsar’s companion:
s = Ω2/3

where M = mp + mc is the total mass, Ωorb is the angular frequency of the
orbit, and ap is the semi-major axis of the pulsar’s orbit. Apsidal motion —
precession of the (approximately) elliptical orbit at a rate ˙ω provides another
combination of parameters involving the mass,
˙ω = 3(GM)2/3 Ω5/3

.
(9)
By combining measurements of s and ˙ω, the individual masses mp and mc
and the orbital inclination can be determined. Through this approach, masses
of a sizable number of neutron stars have been determined (Figure 10).
Radiation of gravitational waves causes the two objects to spiral in, yield-
ing a increase in orbital frequency at a rate, ˙Ωorb. The measured increase has
been shown to be consistent with GR for several pulsars, most notably for the
Hulse-Taylor binary and for the double pulsar.
6.4 Pulsars as Gravitational Wave Detectors
A gravitational wave causes a test mass to move at the frequency of the wave.
The amount of motion is very small. In a pulse timing context, both the
Earth and the pulsar serve as test masses (Figure 11). Long-period waves
(years) induce cumulative changes in pulse phase (and, thus, TOAs), so the
greatest sensitivity is to waves that are comparable in period to the length

of a many-year data set of TOAs. The technique is well discussed in [6] and
was originally proposed by [40]. Measurements [41, 42, 43] yield upper bounds
on the eﬀective mass-energy density of a cosmological background of waves
at the level of Ωgh2 ∼< 10−8, where Ωg is the density in units of the closure
density of the universe. A good discussion of one kind of background is in
[44]. Various workers have proposed a “pulsar timing array” [45, 46] which
would use multiple pulsars to discriminate between other sources of timing
perturbations while also detecting a correlated signal that is present because
the Earth is in common to all lines of sight. The pulsar timing array is a key
science project for the Square Kilometer Array [4].

Theory of Gamma-Ray Burst Sources
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
Institute for Advanced Study, Einstein Drive, Princeton, NJ 08540:
enrico@ias.edu
In the sections which follow, we shall be concerned predominantly with the
theory of γ-ray burst sources. If the concepts there proposed are indeed rele-
vant to an understanding of the nature of these sources, then their existence
becomes inextricably linked to the metabolic pathways through which gravity,
spin, and energy can combine to form collimated, ultrarelativistic outﬂows.
These threads are few and fragile, as we are still wrestling with trying to under-
stand non-relativistic processes, most notably those associated with the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld and gas dynamics. If we are to improve our picture-making
we must make more and stronger ties of physical theory. But in reconstruct-
ing the creature, we must be guided by our eyes and their extensions. In this
introductory section we have therefore attempted to summarise the observed
properties of these ultra-energetic phenomena.
1 A Field Guide to Gamma-Ray Bursts
1.1 A Burst of Progress
The ﬁrst sighting of a γ-ray burst, alias GRB, came on July 2, 1967, from the
military Vela satellites monitoring for nuclear explosions in veriﬁcation of the
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty [52]. These γ-ray ﬂashes proved to be rather diﬀerent
from the man-made explosions that the satellites were designed to detect. Over
the next 30 years, hundreds of GRB detections were made. Frustratingly, they
continued to vanish too soon to get an accurate angular position to permit
follow-up observations. The reason for this is that γ-rays are notoriously hard
to focus, so γ-ray images are generally not very sharp.
Before 1997, most of what we knew about GRBs was based on observa-
tions from the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), whose results have been sum-
marised in [30]. BATSE, which measured about 3000 events, revealed that
between two or three bursts occur somewhere in the observable universe on a

typical day. While they are on, they outshine every other source in the γ-ray
sky, including the sun. Although each is unique, the bursts fall into one of two
rough categories. Bursts that last less than two seconds are short, and those
that last longer – the majority – are long. The two categories diﬀer spectro-
scopically, with short bursts having relatively more high-energy γ-rays than
long bursts do (Section 1.2).
Arguably the most important result from BATSE concerned the distribu-
tion of bursts. They occur isotropically – that is, evenly over the entire sky,
suggesting a cosmological distribution with no dipole and quadrupole com-
ponents. This ﬁnding cast doubt on the prevailing wisdom, which held that
bursts came from sources within the Milky Way. The uniform distribution led
most astronomers to conclude that the instruments were picking up some kind
of event happening throughout the universe. Unfortunately, γ-rays alone did
not provide enough information to settle the question for sure. The detection
of radiation from bursts at other wavelengths would turn out to be essential.
Visible light, for example, could reveal the galaxies in which the bursts took
place, allowing their distances to be measured. Attempts were made to detect
these burst counterparts, but they proved fruitless.
A watershed event occurred in 1997, when the spacecraft BeppoSAX suc-
ceeded in obtaining high-resolution X-ray images [22] of the predicted fading
afterglow of GRB 970228 – so named because it occurred on February 28,
1997. This detection, followed by a number of others at an approximate rate
of 10 per year, led to positions accurate to about an arc minute, which allowed
the detection and follow-up of the afterglows at optical and longer wavelengths
[110]. This paved the way for the measurement of redshift distances, the iden-
tiﬁcation of candidate host galaxies, and the conﬁrmation that they were at
cosmological distances [71].
Among the ﬁrst GRBs pinpointed by BeppoSAX was GRB 970508. Radio
observations of its afterglow provided an essential clue. The glow varied er-
ratically by roughly a factor of two during the ﬁrst three weeks, after which
it stabilised and then began to diminish. The large variations probably had
nothing to do with the burst source itself; rather they involved the propa-
gation of the afterglow light through space. Just as the Earth’s atmosphere
causes visible starlight to twinkle, interstellar plasma causes radio waves to
scintillate. Therefore, if GRB 970508 was scintillating at radio wavelengths
and then stopped, its source must have grown from a mere point to a dis-
cernible disk. “Discernible” here means a few light-weeks across. To reach
this size the source must have been expanding at a considerable rate – close
to the speed of light [115]. The BeppoSAX and follow-up observations have
transformed our view of GRBs. The old concept of a sudden release of energy
concentrated in a few brief seconds has been discarded. Indeed, even the term
“afterglow” is now recognised as misleading – the energy radiated during both
phases is comparable.
The next step for GRB astronomy is to ﬂesh out the data on burst, after-
glow and host-galaxy characteristics. One needs to measure many hundreds

of bursts of all varieties: long and short, bright and faint, bursts that are
mostly γ-rays and bursts that are mostly X-rays. Currently we are obtain-
ing burst positions from the second High Energy Transient Explorer satel-
lite, launched in October 2000, and the Interplanetary Network, a series of
small γ-ray detectors piggybacking on planetary spacecraft. The Swift mis-
sion, recently launched, now oﬀers multi-wavelength observations of tens of
long GRBs and their afterglows. On discovering a GRB, the γ-ray instrument
triggers automatic onboard X-ray and optical observations. A rapid response
determines whether the GRB has an X-ray and/or visible afterglow. A strik-
ing development in the last several months has been the measurement and
localization of fading X-ray signals from several short GRBs by Swift. Other
missions, though not designed solely for GRB discovery, will also contribute.
The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, detects between 10
to 20 GRBs a year. The Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope, planned
for launch a decade from now, will have a sensitive gamma-ray instrument
capable of detecting thousands of GRBs.
1.2 Gamma Rays: Clues
GRBs are brief ﬂashes of radiation at hard X-ray and soft γ-ray energies that
display a wide variety of time histories, though in ∼25% of the cases a char-
acteristic single-pulse proﬁle is observed, consisting of a rapid rise followed
by a slower decay [30]. GRBs were ﬁrst detected at soft γ-ray energies with
wide ﬁeld-of-view instruments. Peak soft γ-ray ﬂuxes reach hundreds of pho-
tons cm−2 s−1 in rare cases. The BATSE instrument is sensitive in the 50-300
keV band, and provides the most extensive data base of GRB observations
during the prompt phase. It searches for GRBs by examining strings of data
for > 5.5σ enhancements above the background on the 64 ms, 256 ms, and
1024 ms time scales, and triggers on GRBs as faint as ≈0.5 ph cm−2 s−1,
corresponding to energy ﬂux sensitivities < 10−7 ergs cm−2 s−1.
The integral size distribution of BATSE GRBs in terms of peak ﬂux φp
is very ﬂat below ∼3 ph cm−2 s−1, and becomes steeper than the −3/2
behaviour expected from a Euclidean distribution of sources at φp > 10 ph
cm−2 s−1 [111]. GRBs typically show a very hard spectrum in the hard X-
ray to soft γ-ray regime, with a photon index breaking from ≈−1 at photon
energies Eph < 50 keV to a −2 to −3 spectrum at Eph > several hundred
keV [5]. Consequently, the distribution of the peak photon energies Epk of the
time-averaged νFν spectra of BATSE GRBs are typically found in the 100
keV - several MeV range [64]. The general trend is that the spectrum softens,
and Epk decreases, with time. More precise statements must however wait for
larger area detectors.
In Figure 1 are plotted representative spectra, in the unconventional co-
ordinates ν and νFν, the energy radiated per logarithmic frequency interval.
Some obvious points should be emphasised. We measure directly only the
speciﬁc luminosity D2νIν ≡(1/4π)νLν (the energy radiated in the direction

Figure 1 is that of 9206022 which was observed simultaneously by BATSE,
COMPTEL and Ulysses. The time integrated spectrum on those detectors
ranges from 25 keV to 10MeV [43].
Most GRBs are accompanied by a high-energy tail which contains a signif-
icant amount of energy – ν2N(ν) is almost constant. The EGRET instrument
on the CGRO detected 7 GRBs with > 30 MeV emission during the prompt
phase [30], including the extraordinary burst GRB 940217, which displayed
> 100 MeV emission 90 minutes after the onset of the GRB, including one
photon with energy near 20 GeV [49]. This gives unambiguous evidence for
the importance of nonthermal processes in GRBs. TeV radiation has been re-
ported to be detected with the Milagrito water Cherenkov detector from GRB
970417a [4]. If correct, this requires that this source be located at z < 0.3 in
order that γ −γ attenuation with the diﬀuse intergalactic infrared radiation
be small.
A class of X-ray rich GRBs, with durations of order of minutes and X-ray
ﬂuxes in the range 10−8-10−7 ergs cm−2 s−1 in the 2-25 keV band, has been
detected with many X-ray satellites, including Ariel V, HEAO-1, ROSAT,
Ginga, and Beppo-SAX [45].

A typical GRB (if there is such a thing) lasts about ten seconds. Observed
durations vary, however, by six orders of magnitude, from several milliseconds
[30] to several thousand seconds [53]. The shortest BATSE burst had a du-
ration of 5ms with a 0.2ms structure [10]. The longest so far, GRB940217,
displayed GeV activity one and a half hours after the main event [49]. The
bursts GRB 961027a, GRB961027b, GRB 961029a and GRB 961029b oc-
curred in the same region of the sky within two days [30]; if this gang of
four is considered as a single event then the longest duration so far is two
days! These observations may indicate that some sources display a continued
activity (at a variable level) over a period of days.

BATSE lightcurves of various individual bursts. The y axis is the photon
count rate in the 0.05 to 0.5 MeV range; the x axis is the time in seconds since the
burst trigger. Both before and after the burst trigger, no γ-rays are detected, above
background, from the same direction. Clockwise, from top left: GRB 990123, GRB
990510, GRB 000131, and GRB 000131.
The bursts have complicated and irregular time proﬁles which vary dras-
tically from one burst to another. They range from smooth, fast rise and
quasi-exponential decay, through curves with several peaks, to variable curves
with many peaks. Various proﬁles, selected from the BATSE catalogue, are
shown in Figure 2. About 3% of bursts are preceded by a precursor with a
lower peak intensity than the main event [57], while 8% of them contain at

least one long period of quiescence [87]. Several bursts observed by Ginga
showed signiﬁcant thermal X-ray emission before the main high energy pulse
[73]. Some of these bursts were also followed by low energy X-ray tails. These
are probably pre-discovery detections of the X-ray afterglows observed now
by Swift and HETE-II and previously uncovered by BeppoSAX.
Fig. 3. Hardness ratio versus duration of BATSE bursts. The hardness ratio is a
measure of the shape of the spectrum: larger values correspond to harder spectra.
Diﬀerent line levels denote number density contours. The bimodality of the distrib-
ution of their duration is conﬁrmed by the associated spectral shape. Indicated are
the positions in the diagram of the BeppoSax GRBs with detected optical transients.
All information derived from the precise localization of BeppoSax refers only to long
duration GRBs.
The duration of a GRB is deﬁned by the time during which the mid-
dle 50% (t50) or 90% (t90) of the counts above background are measured.
A bimodal duration distribution is measured, irrespective of whether the t50
or t90 durations are considered [58]. About two-thirds of BATSE GRBs are
long-duration GRBs with t90 > 2 s, with the remainder comprising the short-
duration GRBs. This bimodality is conﬁrmed by the associated spectral shape,
since short bursts, on average, appear harder than long GRBs. Figure 3 shows
the hardness ratio as a function of the duration of the emission. The hardness
ratio is a measure of the slope of the spectrum where larger values means that
the ﬂux at high energies dominates.
The BATSE results also showed that the angular distribution of GRBs on
the sky is isotropic, and that the size distribution exhibits a strong ﬂattening
for faint bursts [65]. This behaviour follows from a cosmological origin of
GRB sources, with the decline in the number of faint bursts due to cosmic

expansion. Follow-up X-ray observations with the Narrow Field Instrument
on BeppoSAX has permitted redshift determinations that ﬁrmly establish the
distance scale to the sources of > 2 s duration GRBs, which are those to which
BeppoSAX was sensitive (Figure 3).
1.3 A Warm Afterglow
Launched on April 1996, the BeppoSAX satellite made breakthrough obser-
vations of GRBs, succeeding in positioning them with error boxes of only
a few arcminutes through its coded mask Wide Field Camera, sensitive at
medium–hard X–ray energies (i.e. 2–25 keV). The BeppoSAX GRB obser-
vations revealed that essentially all long-duration GRBs have fading X-ray
afterglows [23]. The Wide Field Camera on BeppoSAX has sensitivity down
to ∼10−10 ergs cm−2 s−1 with < 10′ error boxes. Spacecraft slewing requires
6-8 hours, but permits Narrow Field Instrument X-ray observations with sen-
sitivity down to ∼10−14 ergs cm−2 s−1 and error boxes < 0.5′. The ﬁrst X-ray
afterglow was obtained from GRB 970228 [22], which revealed an X-ray source
which decayed according to a power-law behaviour φX ∝tχ, with χ ∼−1.33.
Typically, χ ∼−1.1 to −1.5 in X-ray afterglows. The spectral shape is re-
markably softer than the prompt emission, with F(ν) roughly proportional to
ν−1.
The small X-ray error boxes allow deep optical and radio follow-up stud-
ies. GRB 970228 was the ﬁrst GRB from which an optical counterpart was
observed [110], and GRB 970508 was the ﬁrst GRB for which a redshift was
measured [26, 71]. Detection of optical emission lines from the host galaxy,
and absorption lines in the fading optical afterglow due to the presence of
intervening gas has provided redshifts for about 30 GRBs. No optical coun-
terparts are detected from approximately one-half of GRBs with well-localized
X-ray afterglows, and these are termed dark bursts. These sources may be un-
detected in the optical band because of dusty media [44] or because they are
optically faint by nature [7].
The monochromatic ﬂux decreases in time as a power law Fν(t) ∝t−0.8
– t−2. Usually, the magnitudes of the optical afterglow detected ∼one day
after the γ–ray event are in the range 19–21. An observation that attracted
much attention was the discovery [1] of a prompt and extremely bright (vi-
sual magnitude mv ∼9) optical ﬂash in GRB 990123, 15 s after the GRB
started and while it was still going on. The term ﬂash is indeed appropriate.
A magnitude 9 at a redshift z = 1.6 corresponds a power L ∼5×1049 erg s−1
in the optical band, meaning that if the event had instead taken place a few
thousands light-years away, it would have been as bright as the midday sun,
albeit for a short time. Due to the brightness of the afterglow and its prompt
optical emission, photometric observations were extensive, making it one of
the best-studied afterglows (Figure 4).

Fig. 4. One of the brightest GRB yet recorded went oﬀon January, 23, 1999.
The radiation, which started out concentrated in the γ-ray range during the burst,
progressively evolved into an afterglow radiation that peaked in the X-rays, then
ultraviolet (UV), optical, infrared, and radio. GRB 990123 is still the only burst
detected so far in the optical while the prompt emission was still on, by the robotic
telescope ROTSE, 22 seconds after the trigger at mv ∼11.7, reaching mv ∼9 a few
tens of seconds after [1].
Approximately 40% of GRBs have radio counterparts and the transition
from scintillating to smooth behaviour in the radio afterglow of GRB 970508
provides direct evidence for relativistic source expansion [32].
The redshifts of nearly 100 GRBs are now known (early 2006), with the
median ⟨z⟩∼1.5 and the largest measured redshift at z = 6.295. The corre-
sponding distances imply apparent isotropic γ-ray energy releases in the range
from ≈1051-1054 erg (Figure 5). For a solar-mass object, this implies that an
unusual large fraction of the energy is converted into γ-ray photon energy.
This spread in the inferred luminosities obtained under the assumption of
isotropic emission may be reduced if most GRB outﬂows are jet-like.
X-ray emission lines, possibly due to Fe Kα ﬂuorescence, were detected
during a re-brightening phase in the afterglow of GRB 970508 [82], and in the
afterglow spectra of GRB 991216 [83] and GRB 000214 [3]. A detection of soft
X-ray emission features was also reported from GRB 011211 [92]. The observed
frequencies of the lines appear displaced from the laboratory frequency, as
expected from the Doppler shift caused by the expansion of the universe, in
agreement with the redshift measured in optical lines from the host galaxy.
A transient absorption feature was detected from GRB 990705 [2], and X-ray
absorption in excess of the Galactic hydrogen column density has also been
reported in GRB 980329 [35]. These results oﬀer an alternative method of

redshift determination, and provide important clues about the environment
of the progenitor object, showing that a high column density of gas must be
present in the vicinity of these sources.
1.4 Hosts, Supernova Family Ties, and Cosmological Setting
Demography
For the long GRB afterglows localized so far, a host galaxy has been found
in most cases. As of early 2006, plausible or certain host galaxies have been
found for all but 1 or 2 of the bursts with optical, radio, or X-ray afterglows
localised with arcsecond precision. The median apparent magnitude is R ≈25
mag, with tentative detections or upper limits reaching down to R ≈29 mag.
The few missing cases are at least qualitatively consistent with being in the
faint tail of the observed distribution of host galaxy magnitudes [20]. We note
also that the observations in the visible probe the UV in the rest frame, and
are thus especially susceptible to extinction. However, sub-mm detections of
dusty GRB hosts are currently limited by the available technology to only a
handful of ultraluminous sources [8].
The majority of redshifts so far are from the spectroscopy of host galaxies,
but an increasing number are based on the absorption-line systems seen in the
spectra of the afterglows (which are otherwise featureless power-law continua).
Reassuring overlap exists in several cases; invariably, the highest-z absorption
system corresponds to that of the host galaxy, and has the strongest lines.
In some cases (a subset of the so-called “dark bursts”) no optical transient is
detected, but a combination of the X-ray and radio transient unambiguously
pinpoints the host galaxy [27].

86
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
Are the GRB host galaxies special in some way? This is hard to answer
[27] from their visible (∼restframe UV) luminosities alone: the observed light
traces an indeterminate mix of recently formed stars and an older population,
and cannot be unambiguously interpreted in terms of either the total baryonic
mass, or the instantaneous star formation rate (SFR).
The magnitude and redshift distributions of GRB host galaxies are typical
for the normal, faint ﬁeld galaxies, as are their morphologies when observed
with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST): they are often compact, and some-
times suggestive of a merging system [17], but that is not unusual for galaxies
at comparable redshifts. Within the host galaxies, the distribution of GRB-
host oﬀsets follows the light distribution closely [17], which is roughly pro-
portional to the density of star formation (especially for the high-z galaxies).
It is thus fully consistent with a progenitor population associated with the
sites of massive star formation. Spectroscopic measurements provide direct
estimates of recent, massive SFR in GRB hosts [27]. The observed unobscured
SFRs range from a few tenths to a few M⊙yr−1 [8]. All this is entirely typical
for the normal ﬁeld galaxy population at comparable redshifts. However, such
measurements are completely insensitive to any fully obscured SFR compo-
nents.
Equivalent widths of the [O II] 3727 doublet in GRB hosts, which may
provide a crude measure of the SFR per unit luminosity (and a poorer mea-
sure of the SFR per unit mass), are on average somewhat higher [27] than
those observed in magnitude-limited ﬁeld galaxy samples at comparable red-
shifts [48]. A larger sample of GRB hosts, and a good comparison sample,
matched both in redshift and magnitude range, are necessary before any solid
conclusions can be drawn from this apparent diﬀerence. One intriguing hint
comes from the ﬂux ratios of [Ne III] 3869 to [O II] 3727 lines: they are on
average a factor of 4 to 5 higher in GRB hosts than in star forming galaxies at
low redshifts [27] . Strong [Ne III] requires photoionization by massive stars
in hot H II regions, and may represent indirect evidence linking GRBs with
massive star formation.
The interpretation of the luminosities and observed star formation rates is
vastly complicated by the unknown amount and geometry of extinction. The
observed quantities (in the visible) trace only the unobscured stellar compo-
nent, or the components seen through optically thin dust. Any stellar and star
formation components hidden by optically thick dust cannot be estimated at
all from these data, and require radio and sub-mm observations [89]. As of
late 2002, radio and/or sub-mm emission powered by obscured star formation
has been detected from 4 GRB hosts [34, 8]. The surveys to date are sensitive
only to the ultra-luminous (L > 1012L⊙) hosts, with SFR of several hundred
M⊙yr−1 (Figure 6). Modulo the uncertainties posed by the small number
statistics, the surveys indicate that about 20% of GRB hosts are objects of
this type, where about 90% of the total star formation takes place in obscured
regions.

frequencies to facilitate a direct comparison. These highly star forming galaxies
are more luminous than Arp 220, and are similar to HR 10, indicating that their
bolometric luminosities exceed 1012 L⊙, and their star formation rates are of the
order of 500 M⊙yr−1. On the other hand, the spectral slopes in the optical regime
are ﬂatter than both Arp 220 and HR 10, indicating that the GRB host galaxies are
bluer than Arp 220 and HR 10. Panel from [8].
Given the uncertainties of the geometry of optically thin and optically
thick dust, optical colours of GRB hosts cannot be used to make any mean-
ingful statements about their net star formation activity. The broad-band
optical colours of GRB hosts are not distinguishable from those of normal
ﬁeld galaxies at comparable magnitudes and redshifts [17]. It is notable that
the optical/NIR colours of GRB hosts detected in the sub-mm are much bluer
than typical sub-mm selected galaxies, suggesting that the GRB selection may
be probing a previously unrecognised population of dusty star-forming galax-
ies [89, 108, 8].
On the whole, the GRB hosts seem to be representative of the normal,
star-forming ﬁeld galaxy population at comparable redshifts, and so far there
is no evidence for any signiﬁcant systematic diﬀerences between them.
Supernova Partnership
At cosmological distances, the total energy of GRBs is roughly of the same
order of magnitude as that of supernovae; in GRBs, however, the energy is
emitted much more rapidly. The reason is that in supernovae the energy (ex-
cept that in neutrinos) is thermalised by a large amount of mass (several solar

88
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
masses). It therefore came as something of a surprise when [38] found that
the BeppoSAX error box of GRB 980425 contained the supernova SN 1998bw.
This supernova is located in a spiral arm of the nearby galaxy ESO 184-G82,
at a redshift of 2550 km/s, corresponding to a distance of 40 Mpc. On the
basis of very conservative assumptions regarding the error box and the time
window in which the supernova occurred, [38] determined that the probabil-
ity that any supernova with peak optical ﬂux a factor of 10 below that of SN
1998bw would be found in the error box by chance coincidence is 10−4.
With respect to apparent properties (peak ﬂux, duration, burst proﬁle)
GRB 980425 was not remarkable. Of course, at its distance of 40 Mpc, its
total energy 8 × 1047 erg/s is some ﬁve orders of magnitude smaller than that
of normal GRBs.
Independent of its connection with a GRB, SN 1998bw is extraordinary
for its very high radio luminosity near the peak of the SN lightcurve [59].
An analysis of the optical lightcurve [38] and its early spectra [50] showed
that it was an extremely energetic event – total explosive energy in the range
2−6×1052 erg, i.e. a factor of ∼30 higher than is typical for a Ib/c supernova.
Because the sampling volume for low luminosity bursts such as 980425 is
smaller than that of normal GRBs by a factor of 106, the rate (per galaxy) of
the former events may well exceed those of the latter by a large factor. Due to
their small distances they are expected to contribute a φ−3/2
p
component to
the log N(> φp) distribution. From the absence of a turn-up at the ﬂux limit
(φp ≃0.2), [55] inferred that such a Euclidean component can contribute at
most 10% to the observed BATSE burst sample. With a normal GRB rate
of 10−8 per galaxy per year [117], the corresponding limit on events like SN
1998bw is thus a few 10−4 per galaxy per year. With an observed rate of type
Ib/c supernova of a few times 10−3 per year per galaxy [112], this rather weak
limit serves to show that at most a fraction of the SN Ib/c produce GRBs.
The observational basis for a connection between GRBs and supernovae
was greatly enriched with the discovery by [15] of a late time component
superposed on the power law optical lightcurve of GRB 980326, which they
argue reﬂects an underlying supernova. The optical lightcurve of GRB 980326
showed an initial rapid decay; the lightcurve ﬂattened after ∼10 days to a
constant value R = 25.5 ± 0.5. Such ﬂattening has been seen in the light
curves of other afterglows as well, and has been interpreted as the signature
of an underlying host galaxy [111]. Observations by [15] made ∼3 weeks
after the burst revealed a surprising brightening of the afterglow, to a ﬂux
level 60 times above that expected from an extrapolation of the power-law
decay. At the same time, the spectral energy distribution became very red.
Observations made ∼9 months after the burst showed that any host galaxy is
fainter than R=27.3. Using the multicolour light curve of SN 1998bw [38] as a
template, [15] found that they can reproduce the observed optical light curve
of GRB 980326 by a combination of a power-law and a bright, simultaneous
1998bw-like supernova at a redshift z ∼1.

Theory of Gamma-Ray Burst Sources
89
A number of other GRBs since then have shown similar late deviations
from a power-law decline (the best example being GRB 011121 [40]), but
they still lacked a clear spectroscopic detection of an underlying supernova.
Detection of such signature was recently reported by [106] for GRB 030329.
Due to its extreme brightness and slow decay, spectroscopic observations were
extensive. The early spectra consisted of a power-law decay continuum (Fν ∝
ν−0.9) typical of GRB afterglows with narrow emission features identiﬁable
as Hα, [OIII], Hβ and [OII] at z = 0.1687, making GRB 030329 the second
nearest burst overall (GRB 980425 possibly associated with the nearby SN
1998bw is the nearest at z = 0.0085) and the classical burst with the lowest
known redshift.
Fig. 7. The supernova dominated spectrum of GRB 030329 obtained in April 8
with the MMT telescope by [106]. The residual spectrum shows broad bumps at
approximately 5000 ˚A and 4200 ˚A (rest frame), which are similar to those seen in
the spectrum of the peculiar type Ic SN 1998bw a week before maximum [79].
Beginning April 6 (i.e. 8 days after the GRB), the spectra showed the
development of broad peaks in ﬂux, characteristic of a supernova. The broad
bumps are seen at approximately 5000 ˚A and 4200 ˚A (rest-frame). Over the
next few days the SN features became more prominent as the afterglow faded
and the SN brightened towards maximum. The afterglow spectrum of April
8, clearly supernova dominated, is shown in Figure 7. For comparison, spectra
of SN 1998bw at maximum and a week before maximum are also displayed
[79]. The similarities are striking. While the presence of supernovae has been
inferred from the lightcurves and colours of GRB afterglows in the past, this
is the ﬁrst convincing spectroscopic evidence that a supernova was lurking
beneath the optical afterglow of a long duration GRB.

GRBs and Cosmology
While interesting on their own, GRBs are now rapidly becoming powerful
tools to study the high-redshift universe and galaxy evolution, thanks to their
apparent association with massive star formation, and their brilliant luminosi-
ties. There are three basic ways of learning about the evolution of luminous
matter and gas in the universe. First, a direct detection of sources (i.e., galax-
ies) in emission, either in the UV/optical/NIR (the unobscured components),
or in the FIR/sub-mm/radio (the obscured component). Second, the detec-
tion of galaxies selected in absorption along the lines of sight to luminous
background sources, traditionally QSOs. Third, diﬀuse extragalactic back-
grounds. Studies of GRB hosts and afterglows can contribute to all three of
these methodological approaches, bringing in new, independent constraints for
models of galaxy evolution and of the history of star formation in the universe
[11, 89, 27].
Already within months of the ﬁrst detections of GRB afterglows, no optical
afterglows were found associated with some well-localised bursts despite deep
and rapid searches; the prototype dark burst was GRB 970828 [28]. Perhaps
the most likely explanation for the non-detections of optical transients when
suﬃciently deep and prompt searches are made is that they are obscured
by dust in their host galaxies. This is an obvious culprit if indeed GRBs
are associated with massive star formation. The census of optical afterglow
detections for well-localised bursts can thus provide a completely new and
independent estimate of the mean obscured star formation rate [89]. There is
one possible loophole in this argument: GRBs may be able to destroy the dust
in their immediate vicinity up to ∼10 pc [116, 39], and if the rest of the optical
path through their hosts (∼kpc scale?) was dust-free, the optical afterglow
would become visible. Such a geometrical arrangement may be unlikely in
most cases, and our argument probably still applies. A more careful treatment
of the dust evaporation geometry is needed, but it is probably safe to say that
GRBs can provide a valuable new constraint on the history of star formation
in the universe.
Absorption spectroscopy of GRB afterglows is now becoming a powerful
new probe of the ISM in evolving galaxies, complementary to the traditional
studies of quasar absorption line systems. The key point is that the GRBs,
almost by deﬁnition (that is, if they are closely related to the sites of ongoing
or recent massive star formation, as the data seem to indicate), probe the lines
of sight to dense, central regions of their host galaxies (∼1−10 kpc scale). On
the other hand, the quasar absorption systems are selected by the gas cross
section, and favour large impact parameters (∼10 −100 kpc scale), mostly
probing the gaseous halos of ﬁeld galaxies, where the physical conditions are
very diﬀerent.
The growing body of data on GRB absorption systems shows exception-
ally high column densities of gas, when compared to the typical quasar ab-
sorption systems; only the highest column density DLA systems (themselves

Theory of Gamma-Ray Burst Sources
91
ostensibly star-forming disks or dwarfs) come close [72]. This opens the in-
teresting prospect of using GRB absorbers as a new probe of the chemical
enrichment history in galaxies in a more direct fashion than is possible with
the quasar absorbers, where there may be very complex dynamics of gas ejec-
tion, infall, and mixing at play.
Possibly the most interesting use of GRBs in cosmology is as probes of the
early phases of star and galaxy formation, and the resulting reionization of
the universe at z ∼6−20. The bursts for which redshifts are known are bright
enough to be detectable, in principle, out to much larger distances than those
of the most luminous quasars or galaxies detected at present [60]. Within
the ﬁrst minutes to hours after the burst, the optical light from afterglows is
known to have a range of visual magnitudes mv ∼10 −15, far brighter than
quasars, albeit for a short time. Thus, promptly localized GRBs could serve
as beacons which, shining through the pregalactic gas, provide information
about much earlier epochs in the history of the universe. The presence of iron
or other X-ray lines provides an additional tool for measuring GRB distances,
which may be valuable for investigating the small but puzzling fraction of
bursts which have been detected only in X-rays but not optically, perhaps
due to a high dust content in the host galaxy.
Short-Lived Mysteries
Until recently, short GRBs were known predominantly as bursts of γ-rays,
largely devoid of any observable traces at any other wavelengths. However,
a striking development in the last several months has been the measurement
and localization of fading X-ray signals from several short GRBs, making pos-
sible the optical and radio detection of afterglows, which in turn enabled the
identiﬁcation of host galaxies at cosmological distances [18, 31, 41, 86]. The
presence in old stellar populations e.g., of an elliptical galaxy for GRB050724,
rules out a source uniquely associated with recent star formation [9]. In addi-
tion, no bright supernova is observed to accompany short GRBs [18, 31, 47],
in distinction from most nearby long GRBs [46].
The newly launched Swift spacecraft is expected to yield localizations for
about 100 long and 10 short bursts per year. Swift is equipped with γ-ray, X-
ray and optical detectors for on-board follow-up, and capable of relaying to the
ground arc-second quality burst coordinates within less than a minute from
the burst trigger, allowing even mid-size ground-based telescopes to obtain
prompt spectra and redshifts. This will permit much more detailed studies of
the burst environment, the host galaxy, and the intergalactic medium between
galaxies.
This concludes our compendium of the facts. For ease of reference in the
chapters that follow, they have been assembled here with a minimum of spec-
ulative interpretation.

2 Metabolic Pathways
In this section, we present a partial summary of some general ways by which
gravity, angular momentum and the electromagnetic ﬁeld can couple to power
ultrarelativistic outﬂows, along with reviewing the most popular current mod-
els for the central source.
2.1 Bestiary
As is well known, one of the ﬁrst proposals that was made, soon after the
discovery of quasars in 1963, was that they were powered by accretion onto
massive black holes[119, 99]. The fundamental reason why this proposal was
made was that quasars were known to be prodigiously powerful, with lumi-
nosities equivalent to hundreds of galaxies, and that up to ∼0.1c2 ≡1020 erg
g−1 of energy per unit mass could be released by lowering matter close to a
black hole. This eﬃciency could be over a hundred times that traditionally
associated with nuclear power. Since this time, we have also learned about
black holes with masses ∼5 −10 M⊙in Galactic binary systems and ultra-
luminous X-ray sources which, with decreased conﬁdence, we also associate
with black holes, primarily on energetic grounds. In these objects, accretion
(and the accompanying radiation) is usually thought to be limited by the
Eddington rate, a self–regulatory balance imposed by Newtonian gravity and
radiation pressure. The standard argument gives a maximum luminosity
LEdd = 1.3 × 1038(M/M⊙) erg s−1.
(1)
Although this may not be strictly the case in reality – as in the current
argument concerning the nature of ULXs – it does exhibit the qualitative
nature of the eﬀect of radiation pressure on accreting plasma, in the limit of
large optical depth.
The photon luminosity, for the few-second duration of a typical short burst,
is of course colossal: it exceeds by many thousands the most extreme out-
put from any active galactic nucleus (thought to involve super massive black
holes), and is 12 orders of magnitude above the Eddington limit for a stellar-
mass object. The total energy, however, is not out of line with some other
phenomena encountered in astrophysics - indeed it is reminiscent of the en-
ergy released in the core of a supernova. The Eddington photon limit (1) is
circumvented if the main cooling agent is emission of neutrinos rather than
electromagnetic waves. This regime requires correspondingly large accretion
rates, of the order of one solar mass per second, and is termed hypercritical
accretion. Such high accretion rates are never reached for black holes in XRBs
or AGN, where characteristic rates are below the Eddington rate. They can,
however, be achieved in the process of forming neutron stars and solar-mass
black holes in the core collapse of massive stars. In such a situation, the den-
sities and temperatures are so large (ρ ≃1012 g cm−3, T ≃1011 K) that
photons are completely trapped, and neutrinos are emitted copiously.

Unless they are beamed into less than one percent of the solid angle,
the triggers for GRBs are thousands of times rarer than supernovae. The
current view is that they arise in a very small fraction ∼10−6 of stars which
undergo a catastrophic energy release event toward the end of their evolution.
One conventional possibility is the coalescence of binary neutron stars [61,
75, 29, 74, 94, 96]. Double neutron star (NS) binaries, such as the famous
PSR1913+16, will eventually coalesce due to angular momentum and energy
losses to gravitational radiation. When a neutron star binary coalesces, the
rapidly-spinning merged system could be too massive to form a single neutron
star; on the other hand, the total angular momentum is probably too large to
be swallowed immediately by a black hole [95]. The expected outcome would
then be a spinning hole, orbited by a torus of NS debris.
Other types of progenitor have been suggested - e.g. a NS-BH merger,
where the neutron star is tidally disrupted before being swallowed by the hole
[74, 54, 62]; the merger of a He star (or a WD) with a black hole [120, 36];
or a category labelled as hypernovae [77] or collapsars [118, 63], where the
collapsing core is too massive to become a neutron star, but has too much
angular momentum to collapse quietly into a black hole (as in a so-called
failed supernova). Table 1 provides a summary of the various rate estimates
for some of these GRB progenitors, while Figure 8 illustrates their diﬀerent
production channels. The reader is referred to the excellent review by [66] for
a description of other source models. Aside from the rate of SNe events, the
rate of short GRBs and plausible progenitors in Table 1 are uncertain by at
least a factor of a few. All of the progenitor scenarios listed roughly scale with
the rate of star formation; therefore, the rates at redshift of z = 1 are a factor
of ∼10 higher than locally.
It has become increasingly apparent in the last few years that most plausi-
ble GRB progenitors suggested so far (e.g. NS-NS or NS-BH mergers, He-BH
or WD-BH mergers, and failed SN) are expected to lead to a black hole plus
debris torus system, although a possible exemption includes the formation
from a stellar collapse of a fast rotating neutron star with an ultrahigh mag-
netic ﬁeld. The binding energy of the orbiting debris, and the spin energy of
the BH are the two main reservoirs in the former case. The ﬁrst provides up

to 42% of the rest mass energy of the torus, while the latter can grant up to
29% (for a maximal spin rate) of the mass of the black hole itself. How can the
energy be transformed into outﬂowing relativistic plasma? There seem to be
two options. The energy released as thermal neutrinos is expected to be recon-
verted, via collisions outside the dense core, into electron-positron pairs and
photons. Alternatively, strong magnetic ﬁelds anchored in the dense matter
could convert the gravitational binding energy of the system into a Poynting-
dominated outﬂow. A brief summary of the various metabolic pathways is
presented in Figure 9.

Neutrino Emission
The ν¯ν →e+e−process [29] can tap the thermal energy of the torus produced
by viscous dissipation. For this mechanism to be eﬃcient, the neutrinos must
escape before being advected into the hole; on the other hand, the eﬃciency
of conversion into pairs (which scales with the square of the neutrino density)
is low if the neutrino production is too gradual. An e±, γ ﬁreball arises from
the enormous compressional heating and dissipation which can provide the
driving stresses leading to the relativistic expansion.
Typical estimates suggest a ﬁreball of ≤1051 erg [97, 85], except perhaps in
the collapsar or failed SN Ib/c case where [85] estimate 1052.5 erg for optimum
parameters. If the ﬁreball is collimated into a solid angle Ωνν then of course
the apparent isotropized energy would be larger by a factor (4π/Ωνν).
Fig. 9. Metabolic pathways for the extraction of energy. Panel a: Energy released as
neutrinos is reconverted via collisions outside the dense core into electron-positron
pairs or photons (i). The neutrinos that are emitted from the inner regions of the
debris deposit part of their energy in the outer parts of the disc (ii), driving a strong
baryonic outﬂow. This wind may be responsible for collimating the jet. Panel b:
Strong magnetic ﬁelds anchored in the dense matter can convert the binding and/or
spin energy into a Poynting outﬂow. A dynamo process of some kind is widely
believed to be able to operate in accretion discs, and simple physical considerations
suggest that ﬁelds generated in this way would have a canonical length-scale of the
order of the disc thickness (i). Open ﬁeld lines can connect the disc outﬂow and may
drive a hydromagnetic wind (ii). The above mechanism can tap the binding energy
of the debris torus. A rapidly rotating hole could contain a larger energy reservoir.
This energy could be extracted in principle through MHD coupling to the rotation
of the hole (iii;iv).
Magnetic Processes
An alternative way to tap the torus energy is through dissipation of mag-
netic ﬁelds generated by the diﬀerential rotation in the torus [76, 74, 69, 51].

96
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
The orbiting debris with its large magnetic seed ﬁelds and its turbulent ﬂuid
motion will give rise to a plethora of electromagnetic activity.
If the sun and the simulations, are any guide, then a magnetic ﬁeld that
is growing in the disc will also escape into the corona. We expect coronal
arches, as well as larger scale magnetic structures, to be quite common and
to be regenerated on an orbital timescale. If the footpoints of an arch are
at diﬀerent orbital radii in the disc then they will separate tangentially in
a single period. Field lines will be stretched across the disc surface and will
quickly be forced to reconnect. Diﬀerential rotation will cause the loop to twist
and probably to undergo some topological rearrangement. This provides an
alternative mechanism for heating the disc corona and perhaps for driving an
outﬂow through thermal heating (similar to the neutrino heating mechanism
described above). Although these tangential ﬂux loops may be regenerated by
buoyancy, they will also be stretched and pulled back into the disc.
Field ampliﬁcation could in principle continue until the magnetic pressure
becomes comparable to the gas pressure. This limit can also be written in
the form B2/(4πΣ) < csΩ, where Σ is the surface mass density. The radial
force exerted by such a ﬁeld is predominantly the tension force, the mag-
nitude of which integrated over the disc thickness is BφBp/2π. A poloidal
ﬁeld can in principle exist up to strengths such that this radial force starts
contributing signiﬁcantly to support against gravity. This can be formulated
as B2/(4πΣ) < Ω2r. This limit on B2 is a factor Ωr/cs larger than the
strength in B =

8πρc2s, at which point the magnetic ﬁeld becomes buoyant.
The saturation ﬁeld amplitude is determined by a balance between nonlinear
growth, and dissipative process like reconnection and buoyant escape, and can
clearly really only be estimated through careful, three dimensional, numerical
simulations (which are just now becoming possible).
If the magnetic ﬁelds do not thread the black hole, then a Poynting out-
ﬂow can at most carry the gravitational binding energy of the torus. For a
maximally rotating and a non-rotating black hole this is 0.42 and 0.06 of the
torus rest mass, respectively. The torus or disc mass in a NS-NS merger is
Mt ∼0.1M⊙[98], and for a NS-BH, a He-BH, WD-BH merger or a binary
WR collapse it may be estimated at Mt ∼1M⊙[37]. In the He-BH merger and
WR collapse the mass of the disc is uncertain due to lack of calculations on
continued accretion from the envelope, so 1 M⊙is just a rough estimate. The
largest energy reservoir is therefore associated with NS-BH, He-BH or binary
WR collapse, which have larger discs and fast rotation, the maximum energy
being ∼8×1053ϵ(Mt/M⊙) erg; for the failed SNe Ib (which is a slow rotator)
it is ∼1.2 × 1053ϵ(Mt/M⊙) erg, and for the (fast rotating) NS-NS merger
it is ∼0.8 × 1053ϵ(Mt/0.1M⊙) erg, where ϵ is the eﬃciency in converting
gravitational into MHD jet energy.
Field lines that leave the surface of the inner disc, go up to high latitude,
and then connect with either the gas plunging into the hole or the event
horizon of the black hole, are likely to be more signiﬁcant and they, too,
can extract energy and angular momentum. They have the further advantage

Theory of Gamma-Ray Burst Sources
97
that they are likely to propagate in a region where the Alfv´en speed is large
and there is causal contact between the inﬂow and the disc from closer to
the hole. In fact it is quite likely that, except in the region close to the disc
or the infalling matter, the Alfv´en speed will become relativistic, which may
allow substantial energy to be extracted from the black hole itself [36]. This
is the basis of the proposal that spinning black holes power jets, and possibly
GRBs. The power is created as a large scale Poynting ﬂux or equivalently as
a battery-driven current ﬂowing around an electrical circuit [12]. This neatly
avoids the problem of catastrophic radiative drag close to the jet origin, and
allows the terminal jet Lorentz factors to be large.
Rapid rotation is essentially guaranteed in a NS-NS merger. Since the
central BH will have a mass of about 2.5MBH [94], the NS-NS system can
thus power a jet of up to ∼1.3 × 1054ϵ(MBH/2.5M⊙) erg. The scenarios less
likely to produce a fast rotating BH are the NS-BH merger (where the rotation
parameter could be limited to a ≤MNS/MBH, unless the BH is already fast-
rotating) and the failed SNe Ib (where the last material to fall in would have
maximum angular momentum, but the material that was initially close to
the hole has less angular momentum). For instance, even allowing for low
total eﬃciency ϵ ∼0.3, a NS-NS merger whose jet is powered by the torus
binding energy would only require a modest beaming of the γ-rays by a factor
(4π/Ω) ∼20, or no beaming if the jet is powered by the B-Z mechanism,
to produce the equivalent of an isotropic energy of 1053.5 ergs. The beaming
requirements of BH-NS and some of the other progenitor scenarios are even
less constraining.
3 Great Balls of Fire
In this section, we examine the consequences of the hypothesis that GRB
sources are powered by jets of matter which arise from hydrodynamical ex-
pansion of a relativistic hot ﬂuid. The properties of these outﬂows are strongly
constrained by the physical processes occurring near their origin site. The
emitted radiation is an observable diagnostic of the microphysical processes
of particle acceleration and cooling occurring within the bulk ﬂow. Astrophysi-
cists understand supernova remnants reasonably well, despite continuing un-
certainty about the initiating explosion; likewise, we may hope to understand
the afterglows of GRBs, despite the uncertainties about the trigger that we
have already emphasised.
At cosmological distances the observed GRB ﬂuxes imply energies of order
of up to a solar rest-mass (≤1054 erg), and from causality these must arise
in regions whose size is of the order of kilometres in a time scale of the order
of seconds. This implies that an e±, γ ﬁreball must form [75, 42, 105], which
would expand relativistically. The diﬃculty with this is that a smoothly ex-
panding ﬁreball would convert most of its energy into kinetic energy of acceler-
ated baryons rather than into luminosity, and would produce a quasi-thermal

98
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
spectrum, while the typical time scales would not explain events much longer
than milliseconds. This problem was solved by postulating that shock waves
would inevitably occur in the outﬂow, after the ﬁreball became transparent,
and these would reconvert the kinetic energy of expansion into nonthermal
particles and radiation energy [90]. Best–guess numbers are Lorentz factors Γ
in the range 102 to 103, allowing rapidly-variable emission to occur at radii in
the range 1014 to 1016 cm.
The complicated light curves can be understood in terms of internal shocks
[91] in the outﬂow itself, caused by velocity variations induced near or at the
source. This is followed by the development of a forward shock or blast wave
moving into the external medium ahead of the ejecta, and a reverse shock
moving back into the ejecta as the latter is decelerated by the back-reaction
from the external medium [67]. In the presence of turbulent magnetic ﬁelds
built up behind the shocks, the electrons produce a synchrotron power-law
radiation spectrum similar to that observed in the afterglow [111]. We shall
focus here on the afterglow itself, since the prompt γ-ray emission will be
considered in fuller detail in the following section.
3.1 Elementary Blast Wave Physics
The simplest version of the standard blast wave model involves a spherical,
uncollimated explosion taking place in a uniform surrounding medium. A
relativistic pair ﬁreball is formed when an explosion deposits a large amount of
energy into a compact volume. The pressure of the explosion causes the ﬁreball
to expand, with the thermal energy of the explosion being transformed into
bulk kinetic energy due to strong adiabatic cooling of particles in the comoving
frame [68, 81]. Because of the Thomson coupling between the particles and
photons, most of the original explosion energy is carried by the baryons that
were originally mixed into the explosion. Under certain conditions involving
less-energetic, temporally extended, or very baryon-clean explosions, neutrons
can decouple from the ﬂow [24]. If this does not occur, then the coasting
Lorentz factor Γ0 ∼= E0/Mbc2 , where Mb is the baryonic mass and E0 =
1052E52 ergs is the apparent isotropic energy release.
In the simplest version of the model, the blast wave is approximated by
a uniform thin shell. A forward shock is formed when the expanding shell
accelerates the external medium, and a reverse shock is formed due to decel-
eration of the cold shell. The forward and reverse shocked ﬂuids are separated
by a contact discontinuity and have equal kinetic energy densities. From the
relativistic shock jump conditions [100], 4Γ(Γ −1)n0 = 4 ¯Γ( ¯Γ −1)n′
sh, where
Γ is the blast wave Lorentz factor, ¯Γ is the Lorentz factor of the reverse
shock in the rest frame of the shell, n′
sh is the density of the unshocked ﬂuid
in the proper frame of the expanding shell, and n0 is the density of the cir-
cumburst medium (CM), here assumed to be composed of hydrogen. Particle
acceleration at the reverse shock is unimportant when the reverse shock is
non relativistic, which occurs when

(2)
The unique feature of GRBs is that the coasting Lorentz factor Γ0 may
reach values from hundreds to thousands. By contrast, Type Ia and II SNe
have ejecta speeds that are in the range of ∼5000-30000 km s−1. The rela-
tivistic motion of the radiating particles introduces many interesting eﬀects
in GRB emissions that must be properly taken into account.
Three frames of reference are considered when discussing the emission
from systems moving with relativistic speeds: the stationary frame, which is
denoted here by asterisks, the comoving frame, denoted by primes, and the
observer frame. The diﬀerential distance travelled by the expanding blast wave
during diﬀerential time dt∗is simply dr = βcdt∗, where β =
√
1 −Γ −2. Due to
time dilation, dr = βΓcdt′. Because of time dilation, the Doppler eﬀect, and
the cosmological redshift z, the relationship between comoving and observer
times is (1 + z)Γdt′(1 −β cos θ) = (1 + z)dt′/δ = dt, where θ is the angle
between the emitting element and the observer and δ = [Γ(1 −β cos θ)]−1 is
the Doppler factor. For on-axis emission from a highly relativistic emitting
region, we therefore see that dt ∼= (1 + z)dr/Γ 2c; consequently the blast wave
can travel a large distance Γ 2c∆t during a small observing time interval. A
photon measured with dimensionless energy ϵ = hν/mec2 is emitted with
energy δϵ′/(1 + z).
A blast wave expanding into the surrounding medium acts as a ﬂuid if
there is a magnetic ﬁeld in the comoving frame suﬃciently strong to conﬁne
the particles within the width of the blast wave. The blast-wave width depends
on the duration of the explosion and the spreading of the blast-wave particles.
Because a few seconds duration is regularly observed in GRB light curves, the
blast-wave width must be ∼light-seconds, and is probably much thicker in
view of the 100 s duration observed in some GRBs. We denote this length scale
by ∆0 cm. The shell will spread radially in the comoving frame by an amount
r′
∥≃vsprt′, where t′ ∼= r/(βΓc) is the available comoving time and vspr is the
spreading speed. This implies a shell width in the observer frame of ∆= r/Γ 2
0
due to length contraction, and a spreading radius rspr = Γ 2
0 ∆0, assuming
that the shell spreads with speed vspr ∼= c. The width of the unshocked blast-
wave ﬂuid in the rest frame of the explosion is therefore ∆= min(∆0, r/Γ 2
0 )
[68, 101]. Milligauss ﬁelds are suﬃcient to conﬁne relativistic electrons.
As the blast wave expands, it sweeps up material from the surrounding
medium to form an external shock [67]. In a colliding wind scenario, the blast
wave intercepts other portions of the relativistic wind [91]. Protons captured
by the expanding blast wave from the CM will have total energy Γmpc2 in
the ﬂuid frame, where mp is the proton mass. The kinetic energy swept into
the comoving frame by an uncollimated blast wave at the forward shock per
unit time is given by [13]
dE′
dt′ = 4πr2n0mpc3βΓ(Γ −1).
(3)

100
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
The factor of Γ represents the increase of external medium density due to
length contraction, the factor (Γ −1) is proportional to the kinetic energy
of the swept up particles, and the factor β is proportional to the rate at
which the particle energy is swept. Thus the power is ∝Γ 2 for relativistic
blast waves, and ∝β3 for non relativistic blast waves. This process provides
internal energy available to be dissipated in the blast wave.
A proton that is captured by the blast wave and isotropized in the co-
moving frame will have energy Γmpc2 in the comoving ﬂuid frame, or energy
Γ 2mpc2 in the observer frame. The expanding shell will therefore begin to
decelerate when E0 = Γ0Mbc2 = Γ 2

for non relativistic (β0Γ0 ≪1) explosions, giving v ∝r−3/2, r ∝t2/5, and
v ∝t−3/5, as is well-known. In the relativistic (Γ0 ≫1) limit, Γ ∝r−3/2 and
t ∼= c−1 (

The adiabatic behaviour does not apply when radiative losses are important.
A non relativistic supernova shock becomes radiative at late stages of the
blast-wave evolution. It is not clear whether a GRB ﬁreball is highly radiative
or nearly adiabatic during either its gamma-ray luminous prompt phase or
during the afterglow [114, 113]. In the fully radiative limit, energy conservation
reads β0Γ0M0 ∼= βΓ[M0 + 4πn0r3/3], giving the asymptotes Γ ∝r−3 when
Γ0 ≫Γ ≫1 and β ∝r−3 when Γ −1 ≪1.
Most treatments employing blast-wave theory to explain the observed
emission from GRBs assume that the radiating particles are electrons. The
problem here is that ∼mp/me ∼2000 of the nonthermal particle energy
swept into the blast-wave shock is in the form of protons or ions, unless the
surroundings are composed primarily of electron-positron pairs [56]. For a ra-
diatively eﬃcient system, physical processes must therefore transfer a large
fraction of the swept-up energy to the electron component. In elementary
treatments of the blast-wave model, it is simply assumed that a fraction ee of
the forward-shock power is transferred to the electrons, so that

The strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is another major uncertainty. The
standard prescription is to assume that the magnetic ﬁeld energy density
ub = B2/8π is a ﬁxed fraction eB of the downstream energy density of the
shocked ﬂuid. Hence
B2
8π = 4eBn0mpc2(Γ 2 −Γ) .

It is also generally supposed in simple blast-wave model calculations that some
mechanism – probably the ﬁrst-order shock Fermi process – injects electrons
with a power-law distribution between electron Lorentz factors γmin ≤γ ≤
γmax downstream of the shock front. The electron injection spectrum in the

The observed νFν synchrotron spectrum from a GRB afterglow depends
on the geometry of the outﬂow. Denoting the comoving spectral luminosity by

For a spherical blast-wave geometry, the spectral power is ampliﬁed by two

where D is the luminosity distance.
For collimated blast waves with jet opening angle θj, equation (14) does
not apply when θj < 1/Γ because portions of the blast wave’s radiating
surface no longer contribute to the observed emission. In this case, the blast-
wave geometry is a localised emission region, and the received νFν spectrum
is given by

Here the observed ﬂux is proportional to four powers of the Doppler factor:
two associated with solid angle, one with energy and one with time.
From this formalism, analytic and numerical models of relativistic blast
waves can be constructed. It is useful to deﬁne two regimes depending on
whether γmin < γc, which is called the weak cooling regime, or γmin > γc,
called the strong cooling regime [102]. If the parameters p, ee and eB remain
constant during the evolution of the blast wave, then a system originally in
the weak cooling regime will always remain in the weak cooling regime. In
contrast, a system in the strong cooling regime will evolve to the weak cooling
regime (Figure 10)

As an example of the elementary theory, consider the temporal index in the

(or slow cooling regime) during a portion of the evolution of a blast wave in a uni-
form surrounding medium. The temporal indices χ, and νFν spectral indices αν are
shown, respectively above and below the lines that represent diﬀerent families of
possible emission trajectories.
Figure 11 shows spectral and temporal indices that are derived from the
preceding analytic considerations of a spherical adiabatic blast wave that is
in the strong cooling regime (or weak cooling regime) during a portion of its
evolution. We use the notation that the νFν spectrum is described by
fϵ ∝tχϵαν .
(17)
Observations at a speciﬁc photon energy ϵ will detect the system evolving
through regimes with diﬀerent spectral and temporal behaviours. The rela-
tivistic Sedov phase corresponds to the afterglow regime, and we also consider
a possible relativistic reverse shock (RRS) phase. If equation (2) is satisﬁed
with Γ replaced by Γ0, then the blast wave will not evolve through the RRS
phase. Even for this simple system, a wide variety of behaviours is possi-
ble. Inclusion of additional eﬀects, including a nonuniform external medium
[70] or blast-wave evolution in a partially radiative phase [19] will introduce
additional complications.
The heavy solid and dotted lines in Figure 11 represent the evolution of
the cooling photon energies ϵc and ϵmin, respectively. In the lower-right hand
corner of the diagram, one sees that observations in the afterglow phase may

detect a transition from the uncooled portion of the synchrotron spectrum
where χ = (3−p)/2 and αν = (3−p)/2 to a cooled portion of the synchrotron
spectrum where χ = (2 −3p)/4 and αν = (2 −p)/2. Thus a change in photon
index by 0.5 units is accompanied by a change in temporal index by 1/4 unit,
independent of p. Comparison with afterglow observations can be used to test
the blast-wave model [78]. The recently launched Swift telescope will be able
to monitor behaviours in the time interval between the prompt and afterglow
phase, and to search for other regimes of blast wave evolution and evidence
for evolution in the non-adiabatic regime.
3.2 Isotropic or Beamed Outﬂows?
An observer will receive most emission from those portions of a GRB blast
wave that are within an angle ∼1/Γ to the direction to the observer. The
afterglow is thus a probe for the geometry of the ejecta - at late stages, if
the outﬂow is beamed, we expect a spherically-symmetric assumption to be
inadequate; the deviations from the predictions of such a model would then
tell us about the ejection in directions away from our line of sight [93]. As the
blast wave decelerates by sweeping up material from the CM, a break in the
light curve will occur when the jet opening half-angle θj becomes smaller than
1/Γ. This is due to a change from a spherical blast wave geometry, given by
equation (14), to a geometry deﬁned by a localised emission region, as given
by equation (15). Assuming that the blast wave decelerates adiabatically in
a uniform surrounding medium, the condition θj ∼= 1/Γ = Γ −1

can be derived [103]. Note that the beaming angle is only weakly dependent
on n0 and E0. The appearance of achromatic breaks in the development of
GRB afterglows has been interpreted as indicating that they are jet ﬂows
beamed towards us [33], though these observations may also be associated with
the trans-relativistic evolution of spherical blast waves. Collimation factors of
Ωi/4π < 0.01 have been derived from such steepenings [33, 78]. If GRBs are
mostly jets, then this reduces the energy per burst by two or three orders of
magnitude at the expense of increasing their overall frequency [33].
4 An Unsteady Relativistic Outﬂow
A widely recognised problem is that if the rest mass energy of entrained
baryons in the outﬂow exceeded even 10−5 of the total energy, the associ-

106
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
ated opacity would trap the radiation so that it was degraded by adiabatic
expansion (and thermalised) before escape. This problem arises if the event
is approximated as an instantaneous ﬁreball, or as an outﬂowing wind which
is steady over the entire burst duration. In the previous chapter we have dis-
cussed how kinetic energy can be reconverted into radiation by relativistic
shocks which form when the ejecta run into external matter. Alternatively,
we postulate here an outﬂow persisting (typically) for a few seconds. But in-
stead of assuming this to be a steady wind we suppose that it is irregular on
much shorter timescales. For instance, if the Lorentz factor in an outﬂowing
wind varied by a factor of more than 2, then the shocks that developed when
fast material overtook slower material would be internally relativistic. Dissi-
pation would then take place whenever internal shocks developed in the ejecta
– it need not await the deceleration by swept-up ambient external matter.
Whenever part of the ejecta catches up with other material ejected earlier
at a lower Lorentz factor, an internal shock forms, which dissipates the relative
kinetic energy. To illustrate the basic idea, suppose that two shells of equal
rest mass, but with diﬀerent Lorentz factors Γi and Γj (with Γi > Γj ≫1) are
ejected at times t1 and t2, where t2 −t1 = δt. In the case of highly relativistic
ejecta, the shock develops after a distance of order cδtΓjΓi. For high Lorentz
factors, therefore, the shock takes a long time to develop, even if Γ ≫1. This
is, of course, because the distance that must be caught up is (in the stationary
frame) of order cδt, but the speeds all diﬀer from c by less than 1/Γ 2
j .
For illustration, suppose that the Lorentz factor of the outﬂow is, on av-
erage, Γ∗∼100, but varies from Γ∗/2 to 2Γ∗on a timescale δt. The velocity
diﬀerences are of order 10−4c, so the distance for the shock to develop in
the lab frame is 104cδt. The reconversion of bulk energy can nevertheless be
very eﬃcient: when the two blobs share their momentum, they move with
Γij =

ΓiΓj, so the fraction of the energy dissipated is
ε = Γi + Γj −2

ΓiΓj
Γi + Γj
.
(20)
For the previous numerical example, the eﬃciency would be 0.2. High eﬃ-
ciency does not, therefore, require an impact on matter at rest; all that is
needed is that the relative motions in the comoving frame be relativistic – i.e.
Γi/Γj > 2.
Suppose that the mean outﬂow (over some time tw ∼tgrb) can be charac-
terised by a steady wind with given values of Lw and η = Lw/ ˙Mc2. We then
assume that the actual value of η (or Lw) is unsteady.
The mean properties of the wind determine the average bulk Lorentz factor
Γ ∼(r/r0) for r < rη or Γ ∼η otherwise. Here r0 is the central source
dimension. The Lorentz factor saturates to Γ ∼η at a saturation radius
rη/r0 ∼η where the wind energy density, in radiation or in magnetic energy,
drops below the baryon rest mass density in the comoving frame [21]. The
comoving density in the (continuous) wind regime is n′ = (Lo/4πr2mpc3ηΓ),

Theory of Gamma-Ray Burst Sources

and using the above behaviour of Γ below and above the coasting radius,
as well as the deﬁnition of the Thomson optical depth in a continuous wind
τT ≃n′σT (r/Γ) we ﬁnd that the baryonic photosphere, where τT = 1, due to
electrons associated with baryons, is

(21)
where η2 = (η/102) and Lw,52 = (Lw/1052erg). The above equation holds
provided that η is low enough that the wind has already reached its terminal
Lorentz factor at rτ. This requires η < 103L1/4

, if one takes r0 ∼cδt,
where δt0 = (δt/1sec).
Fig. 12. Schematic spacetime diagram in source frame coordinates of a relativistic
outﬂow, with a range of Lorentz factors, triggered by an explosion that can be
approximated as instantaneous. The axes (logarithmic) are r versus t −(r/c), where
t is time measured by a distant observer, and is zero when the burst is observed to
start. In this plot, light rays are horizontal lines. The primary gamma-ray emission
is assumed to continue, with a quasi-steady luminosity Lw, for a time tw. If Γ
ﬂuctuates by a factor of ∼2 around its mean value, relative motions within the
outﬂowing material give rise to internal shocks. Decreasing η values lead to world
lines further to the left. In case (a), η < ητ and the dissipation occurs when the wind
is optically thick. In case (b), with ηd > η > ητ, ejecta collide in an optically thin
region before reaching the contact discontinuity. The contact discontinuity and the
forward shock are being decelerated because of the increasing amount of external
matter being swept up (giving rise to a long-term afterglow; case [d]), so that they
lag behind the light cone by an increasing amount ∆r , whose increase with r is
steeper than linear. This deceleration allows ejecta to catch up and pass through a
reverse shock just inside the contact discontinuity (case [c]).

108
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
If the value of η at the base increases by a factor > 2 over a timescale δt,
then the later ejecta will catch up and dissipate a signiﬁcant fraction of their
energy at some radius rι > rη given by
rι ∼cδtη2 ∼3 × 1014δt0η2
2 cm.
(22)
Dissipation, to be most eﬀective, must occur when the wind is optically thin.
Otherwise it will suﬀer adiabatic cooling before escaping, and could be ther-
malised. Outside rτ, where radiation has decoupled from the plasma, the
relativistic internal motions in the comoving frame will lead to shocks in the
gas. This implies the following lower limit on η:
η > ητ ≈3 × 101L1/5
w,51δt−1/5
0
.
(23)
The initial wind starts to decelerate when it has swept up ∼η−1 of its
initial mass. For suﬃciently high η, the deceleration radius given in equation
(4) can formally become smaller than the collisional radius of equation (22).
This requires
η > ηd ≈8 × 102L1/8
w,52t1/8
w,1n−1/8
0
δt−3/8

.
(24)
This deceleration allows slower ejecta to catch up, replenishing and re-
energising the reverse shock and boosting the momentum in the blast wave
[88].
Figure 12 shows the schematic world-lines of a relativistic outﬂow with
a range of Lorentz factors. We identify three types of contributions to the
observed time history, each with a diﬀerent character. For a relatively low
Lorentz factor η < ητ, as in curve (a) of Figure 12, the radius rι < rτ, and
the dissipation occurs before the wind is optically thin. Below the baryonic
photosphere, shocks would occur at high optical depths and their spectrum
would suﬀer adiabatic cooling before escaping. For a larger Lorentz factor
η > ηd, corresponding to curve (c) of Figure 12, the ejecta would expand freely
until the contact discontinuity had been decelerated by sweeping up external
material. It would then crash into the reverse shock, thermalising its energy
and boosting the power of the afterglow. In curve (b), with intermediate η,
deceleration occurs at radii rd >
rι, and dissipation takes place when the
wind is optically thin (i.e. when it is most eﬀective).
If the Poynting ﬂux provides a fraction α of the total luminosity Lw at the
base of the wind (at r0), the magnetic ﬁeld there is B0 ∼1010α1/2L1/2

If the electrons are accelerated in the dissipation shocks to a Lorentz factor

(26)
so a very high radiative eﬃciency is ensured even for δt as high as seconds.
If the shock dissipation leads to photons whose energy in the comoving
frame exceeds 1 MeV, then there is the possibility of extra pair production
from photon collisions. For the dissipation to occur outside any possible pair-
dominated photosphere (a requirement that may actually be unnecessary if
the pairs annihilate on a shock cooling timescale) rτ would need to be higher
than in equation (21).
It is clear from equation (26) that a magnetic ﬁeld can ensure eﬃcient
cooling even if it is not strong enough to be dynamically signiﬁcant (i.e. even
for α ≪1). If, however, the ﬁeld is dynamically signiﬁcant in the wind, then
its stresses will certainly dominate the (pre-shock) gas pressure. Indeed, in a
wind with α = 1 the magnetosonic and Alfv´en speeds may remain marginally
relativistic even beyond rη if the ﬁeld becomes predominantly transverse. In
this extreme case, magnetic ﬁelds could inhibit shock formation unless η var-
ied by much more than a factor of 2. On the other hand, the presence of
a dynamically-signiﬁcant and non-uniform ﬁeld could actually drive internal
motions leading to dissipation even in a constant-η wind [107].
5 General Considerations
In the preceding sections, we have endeavoured to outline some of the physical
process that are believed to be most relevant to interpreting GRBs. Although
some of the features now observed in GRB sources (especially afterglows)
were anticipated by theoretical discussions, the recent burst of observational
discovery has left theory lagging behind. There are, however, some topics on
which we do believe that there will be steady work of direct relevance to
interpreting observations.
Foremost amongst these topics is the development and use of sophisti-
cated hydrodynamical codes for numerical simulation of GRB sources. Exist-
ing two dimensional codes have already uncovered some gas-dynamical prop-
erties of relativistic ﬂows unanticipated by analytical models, but there are
some key questions that they cannot yet tackle. In particular, high resolu-
tion is needed because even a tiny mass fraction of baryons loading down the
outﬂow severely limits the attainable Lorentz factor. We must wait for useful
and aﬀordable three dimensional simulations before we can understand the
nonlinear development of instabilities. Well-resolved three dimensional sim-
ulations are becoming increasingly common and they rarely fail to surprise
us. The symmetry-breaking involved in transitioning from two to three di-
mensions is crucial and leads to qualitatively new phenomena. The key to
using simulations productively is to isolate questions that can realistically be
addressed and where we do not know what the outcome will be, and then
to analyse the simulations so that we can learn what is the correct way to
think about the problem and to describe it in terms of elementary principles.

110
Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz
Simulations in which the input physics is so circumscribed that they merely
illustrate existing prejudice are of less value!
Another topic which seems ripe for a more sophisticated treatment con-
cerns the intensity and shape of the intrinsic spectrum of the emitted radia-
tion. Few would dispute the statement that the photons which bring us all our
information about the nature of GRBs are the result of particle acceleration
in relativistic shocks. Since charged particles radiate only when accelerated,
one must attempt to deduce from the spectrum how the particles are being
accelerated, why they are being accelerated, and to identify the macroscopic
source driving the microphysical acceleration process.
Collisionless shocks are among the main agents for accelerating ions as well
as electrons to high energies whenever suﬃcient time is available. Particles re-
ﬂected from the shock and from scattering centres behind the shock in the
turbulent compressed region when coming back across the shock into the tur-
bulent upstream region have a good chance to experience multiple scattering
and acceleration by ﬁrst-order Fermi acceleration. Second-order or stochastic
Fermi acceleration in the broadband turbulence downstream of collisionless
shocks will also contribute to acceleration. In addition, ions may be trapped
at perpendicular shocks. The trapping forces are provided by the electrostatic
potential of the shock and the Lorentz force exerted on the particle by the
magnetic and electric ﬁelds in the upstream region. With each reﬂection at
the shock the particles gyrate parallel to the motional electric ﬁeld, picking
up energy and surﬁng along the shock surface. All these mechanisms are still
under investigation, but there is evidence that shocks play a most important
role in the acceleration of cosmic rays and other particles to very high energies.
There is no in situ information available from astrophysical plasmas. So
one is forced to refer to indirect methods and analogies with accessible plas-
mas. Such plasmas are found only in near-Earth space. Actually, most of the
ideas about and models of the behaviour of astrophysical plasmas have been
borrowed from space physics and have been rescaled to astrophysical scales.
However, the large spatial and long temporal scales in astrophysics and astro-
physical observations do not allow for the resolution of the collisionless state
of the plasmas. For instance, in the solar wind the collisional mean free path
is of the order of a few AU. Looked at from the outside, the heliosphere, the
region which is aﬀected by the solar wind, will thus be considered collision
dominated over time scales longer than a typical propagation time from the
Sun to Jupiter. On any of the smaller and shorter scales this is wrong, because
collisionless processes govern the solar wind here. Similar arguments apply to
stellar winds, molecular clouds, pulsar magnetospheres and the hot gas in
clusters of galaxies. One should thus be aware of the mere fact of a lack of
small-scale observations. Collisionless processes generate anomalous transport
coeﬃcients. This helps in deriving a more macroscopic description. However,
small-scale genuinely collisionless processes are thereby hidden. This implies
that it will be diﬃcult, if not impossible, to infer anything about the real
structure, for instance, of collisionless astrophysical shock waves. The reader

is refer to [6], and [109] for an excellent presentation of the basic kinetic col-
lisionless (space) plasma theory.
When terrestrial plasma physics becomes an exact science, a change of
scale by 10 or 20 orders of magnitude, and the incorporation of the eﬀects of
special relativity may suﬃce to provide us with a fully predictive theory!
The most interesting problem for a theorist remains, however, the nature
of the central engine and the means of extracting power in a useful collimated
form. In all observed cases of relativistic jets, the central object is compact,
either a neutron star or black hole, and is accreting matter and angular mo-
mentum. In addition, in most systems there is direct or indirect evidence that
magnetic ﬁelds are present – detected in the synchrotron radiation in galactic
and extragalactic radio sources or inferred in collapsing supernova cores from
the association of remnants with radio pulsars. This combination of magnetic
ﬁeld and rotation may be very relevant to the production of relativistic jets.
Much of what we have summarised in this respect is conjecture and revolves
largely around diﬀerent prejudices as to how magnetic, three dimensional ﬂows
behave in strong gravitational ﬁelds. There are serious issues of theory that
need to be settled independent of what guidance we get from observations
of astrophysical black holes. The best prospects probably lie with performing
numerical magneto-hydrodynamical simulations.

The old dream of integrating into one the study of micro and macrocosmos is
now a reality. Cosmology, astrophysics and particle physics converge within a
scenario (but still not a theory) of cosmic structure formation and evolution
called Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM). This scenario emerged mainly to explain
the origin of galaxies. In these lecture notes, I ﬁrst present a review of the
main galaxy properties, highlighting the questions that any theory of galaxy
formation should explain. Then, the cosmological background and the main
aspects of primordial perturbation generation and evolution are pedagogically
detached. Next, I focus on the “dark side” of galaxy formation, presenting a
review on ΛCDM halo assembling and properties, and on the main candidates
for non–baryonic dark matter. Finally, the complex processes of baryon dis-
sipation inside the non–linearly evolving CDM halos, formation of disks and
spheroids, and transformation of gas into stars are brieﬂy described, remark-
ing on the possibility of a few driving factors and parameters able to explain
the main body of galaxy properties. A summary and discussion of some of the
issues and open problems of the ΛCDM paradigm are given in the ﬁnal part
of these notes.
1 Introduction
Our vision of the cosmic world and in particular of the whole Universe has
been changing dramatically in the last century. As we will see, galaxies were
repeatedly the main protagonist in the scene of these changes. It is about 80
years since Edwin Hubble established the nature of galaxies as gigantic self-
bound stellar systems and used their kinematics to show that the Universe as
a whole is expanding uniformly at the present time. Galaxies, as the building
blocks of the Universe, are also tracers of its large–scale structure and of its
evolution in the last 13 Gyrs or more. By looking inside galaxies we ﬁnd
that they are the arena where stars form, evolve and collapse in constant
interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM), a complex mix of gas and

plasma, dust, radiation, cosmic rays, and magnetics ﬁelds. The center of a
signiﬁcant fraction of galaxies harbor supermassive black holes. When these
“monsters” are fed with infalling material, the accretion disks around them
release, mainly through powerful plasma jets, the largest amounts of energy
known in astronomical objects. This phenomenon of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN) was much more frequent in the past than in the present, being the
high–redshift quasars (QSO’s) the most powerful incarnation of the AGN
phenomenon. But the most astonishing surprise of galaxies comes from the
fact that luminous matter (stars, gas, AGN’s, etc.) is only a tiny fraction
(∼1 −5%) of all the mass measured in galaxies and the giant halos around
them. What this dark component of galaxies is made of? This is one of the
most acute enigmas of modern science.
Thus, exploring and understanding galaxies is of paramount interest to cos-
mology, high–energy and particle physics, gravitation theories, and, of course,
astronomy and astrophysics. As astronomical objects, among other questions,
we would like to know how do they take shape and evolve, what is the origin of
their diversity and scaling laws, why they cluster in space as observed, follow-
ing a sponge–like structure, what is the dark component that predominates
in their masses. By answering to these questions we would able also to use
galaxies as a true link between the observed universe and the properties of the
early universe, and as physical laboratories for testing fundamental theories.
The content of these notes is as follows. In §2 a review on main galaxy
properties and correlations is given. By following an analogy with biology,
the taxonomical, anatomical, ecological and genetical study of galaxies is pre-
sented. The observational inference of dark matter existence, and the baryon
budget in galaxies and in the Universe is highlighted. Section 3 is dedicated
to a pedagogical presentation of the basis of cosmic structure formation the-
ory in the context of the Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) paradigm. The main
questions to be answered are: why CDM is invoked to explain the formation of
galaxies? How is explained the origin of the seeds of present–day cosmic struc-
tures? How these seeds evolve?. In §4 an updated review of the main results on
properties and evolution of CDM halos is given, with emphasis on the aspects
that inﬂuence the propertied of the galaxies expected to be formed inside the
halos. A short discussion on dark matter candidates is also presented (§§4.2).
The main ingredients of disk and spheroid galaxy formation are reviewed and
discussed in §5. An attempt to highlight the main drivers of the Hubble and
color sequences of galaxies is given in §§5.3. Finally, some selected issues and
open problems in the ﬁeld are resumed and discussed in §6.
2 Galaxy Properties and Correlations
During several decades galaxies were considered basically as self–gravitating
stellar systems so that the study of their physics was a domain of Galactic
Dynamics. Galaxies in the local Universe are indeed mainly conglomerates of

hundreds of millions to trillions of stars supported against gravity either by
rotation or by random motions. In the former case, the system has the shape
of a ﬂattened disk, where most of the material is on circular orbits at radii that
are the minimal ones allowed by the speciﬁc angular momentum of the mater-
ial. Besides, disks are dynamically fragile systems, unstable to perturbations.
Thus, the mass distribution along the disks is the result of the speciﬁc angular
momentum distribution of the material from which the disks form, and of the
posterior dynamical (internal and external) processes. In the latter case, the
shape of the galactic system is a concentrated spheroid/ellipsoid, with mostly
(disordered) radial orbits. The spheroid is dynamically hot, stable to pertur-
bations. Are the properties of the stellar populations in the disk and spheroid
systems diﬀerent?
Stellar Populations
Already in the 40’s, W. Baade discovered that according to the ages, metal-
licities, kinematics and spatial distribution of the stars in our Galaxy, they
separate in two groups: 1) Population I stars, which populate the plane of the
disk; their ages do not go beyond 10 Gyr –a fraction of them in fact are young
( <
∼106 yr) luminous O,B stars mostly in the spiral arms, and their metallicities
are close to the solar one, Z ≈2%; 2) Population II stars, which are located
in the spheroidal component of the Galaxy (stellar halo and partially in the
bulge), where velocity dispersion (random motion) is higher than rotation
velocity (ordered motion); they are old stars (> 10 Gyr) with very low metal-
licities, on the average lower by two orders of magnitude than Population I
stars. In between Pop’s I and II there are several stellar subsystems1.
Stellar populations are true fossils of the galaxy assembling process. The
diﬀerences between them evidence diﬀerences in the formation and evolution
of the galaxy components. The Pop II stars, being old, of low metallicity, and
dominated by random motions (dynamically hot), had to form early in the
assembling history of galaxies and through violent processes. In the meantime,
the large range of ages of Pop I stars, but on average younger than the Pop
II stars, indicates a slow star formation process that continues even today
in the disk plane. Thus, the common wisdom says that spheroids form early
in a violent collapse (monolithic or major merger), while disks assemble by
continuous infall of gas rich in angular momentum, keeping a self–regulated
SF process.
1 Astronomers suspect also the existence of non–observable Population III of pris-
tine stars with zero metallicities, formed in the ﬁrst molecular clouds ∼4 × 108
yrs (z ∼20) after the Big Bang. These stars are thought to be very massive,
so that in scaletimes of 1Myr they exploded, injected a big amount of energy to
the primordial gas and started to reionize it through expanding cosmological HII
regions (see e.g., [20, 21] for recent reviews on the subject).

Interstellar Medium (ISM)
Galaxies are not only conglomerates of stars. The study of galaxies is incom-
plete if it does not take into account the ISM, which for late–type galaxies
accounts for more mass than that of stars. Besides, it is expected that in
the deep past, galaxies were gas–dominated and with the passing of time
the cold gas was being transformed into stars. The ISM is a turbulent, non–
isothermal, multi–phase ﬂow. Most of the gas mass is contained in neutral
instable HI clouds (102 < T < 104K) and in dense, cold molecular clouds
(T < 102K), where stars form. Most of the volume of the ISM is occupied by
diﬀuse (n ≈0.1cm−3), warm–hot (T ≈104 −105K) turbulent gas that con-
ﬁnes clouds by pressure. The complex structure of the ISM is related to (i)
its peculiar thermodynamical properties (in particular the heating and cool-
ing processes), (ii) its hydrodynamical and magnetic properties which imply
development of turbulence, and (iii) the diﬀerent energy input sources. The
star formation unities (molecular clouds) appear to form during large–scale
compression of the diﬀuse ISM driven by supernovae (SN), magnetorotational
instability, or disk gravitational instability (e.g., [7]). At the same time, the en-
ergy input by stars inﬂuences the hydrodynamical conditions of the ISM: the
star formation results self–regulated by a delicate energy (turbulent) balance.
Galaxies are true “ecosystems” where stars form, evolve and collapse in
constant interaction with the complex ISM. Following a pedagogical analogy
with biological sciences, we may say that the study of galaxies proceeded
through taxonomical, anatomical, ecological and genetical approaches.
2.1 Taxonomy
As it happens in any science, as soon as galaxies were discovered, the next
step was to attempt to classify these news objects. This endeavor was taken
on by Edwin Hubble. The showiest characteristics of galaxies are the bright
shapes produced by their stars, in particular those most luminous. Hubble
noticed that by their external look (morphology), galaxies can be divided into
three principal types: Ellipticals (E, from round to ﬂattened elliptical shapes),
Spirals (S, characterized by spiral arms emanating from their central regions
where an spheroidal structure called bulge is present), and Irregulars (Irr,
clumpy without any deﬁned shape). In fact, the last two classes of galaxies
are disk–dominated, rotating structures. Spirals are subdivided into Sa, Sb,
Sc types according to the size of the bulge in relation to the disk, the openness
of the winding of the spiral arms, and the degree of resolution of the arms into
stars (in between the arms there are also stars but less luminous than in the
arms). Roughly 40% of S galaxies present an extended rectangular structure
(called bar) further from the bulge; these are the barred Spirals (SB), where
the bar is evidence of disk gravitational instability.
From the physical point of view, the most remarkable aspect of the mor-
phological Hubble sequence is the ratio of spheroid (bulge) to total luminosity.

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
119
This ratio decreases from 1 for the Es, to ∼0.5 for the so–called lenticulars
(S0), to ∼0.5 −0.1 for the Ss, to almost 0 for the Irrs. What is the origin of
this sequence? Is it given by nature or nurture? Can the morphological types
change from one to another and how frequently they do it? It is interesting
enough that roughly half of the stars at present are in galaxy spheroids (Es
and the bulges of S0s and Ss), while the other half is in disks (e.g., [11]), where
some fraction of stars is still forming.
2.2 Anatomy
The morphological classiﬁcation of galaxies is based on their external aspect
and it implies somewhat subjective criteria. Besides, the “showy” features
that characterize this classiﬁcation may change with the color band: in blue
bands, which trace young luminous stellar populations, the arms, bar and
other features may look diﬀerent to what it is seen in infrared bands, which
trace less massive, older stellar populations. We would like to explore deeper
the internal physical properties of galaxies and see whether these properties
correlate along the Hubble sequence. Fortunately, this seems to be the case in
general so that, in spite of the complexity of galaxies, some clear and sequential
trends in their properties encourage us to think about regularity and the
possibility to ﬁnd driving parameters and factors beyond this complexity.
Figure 1 below resumes the main trends of the “anatomical” properties of
galaxies along the Hubble sequence.
The advent of extremely large galaxy surveys made possible massive and
uniform determinations of global galaxy properties. Among others, the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS2) and the Two–degree Field Galaxy Redshift Sur-
vey (2dFGRS3) currently provide uniform data already for around 105 galaxies
in limited volumes. The numbers will continue growing in the coming years.
The results from these surveys conﬁrmed the well known trends shown in
Fig. 1; moreover, it allowed to determine the distributions of diﬀerent prop-
erties. Most of these properties present a bimodal distribution with two main
sequences: the red, passive galaxies and the blue, active galaxies, with a frac-
tion of intermediate types (see for recent results [68, 6, 114, 34, 127] and
more references therein). The most distinct segregation in two peaks is for
the speciﬁc star formation rate ( ˙
Ms/Ms); there is a narrow and high peak
of passive galaxies, and a broad and low peak of star forming galaxies. The
two sequences are also segregated in the luminosity function: the faint end is
dominated by the blue, active sequence, while the bright end is dominated by
the red, passive sequence. It seems that the transition from one sequence to
the other happens at the galaxy stellar mass of ∼3 × 1010M⊙.

ical sequence. The latter is basically a sequence of change of the spheroid–to–disk
ratio. Spheroids are supported against gravity by velocity dispersion, while disks by
rotation.
The Hidden Component
Under the assumption of Newtonian gravity, the observed dynamics of galax-
ies points out to the presence of enormous amounts of mass not seen as stars
or gas. Assuming that disks are in centrifugal equilibrium and that the orbits
are circular (both are reasonable assumptions for non–central regions), the
measured rotation curves are good tracers of the total (dynamical) mass dis-
tribution (Fig. 2). The mass distribution associated with the luminous galaxy
(stars+gas) can be inferred directly from the surface brightness (density) pro-
ﬁles. For an exponential disk of scalelength Rd (=3 kpc for our Galaxy), the
rotation curve beyond the optical radius (Ropt ≈3.2Rd) decreases as in the
Keplerian case. The observed HI rotation curves at radii around and beyond
Ropt are far from the Keplerian fall–oﬀ, implying the existence of hidden mass
called dark matter (DM) [99, 18]. The fraction of DM increases with radius.
It is important to remark the following observational facts:

Fig. 2. Under the assumption of circular orbits, the observed rotation curve of disk
galaxies traces the dynamical (total) mass distribution. The outer rotation curve of
a nearly exponential disk decreases as in the Keplerian case. The observed rotation
curves are nearly ﬂat, suggesting the existence of massive dark halos.
• the outer rotation curves are not universally ﬂat as it is as-
sumed in hundreds of papers. Following, Salucci & Gentile [101], let
us deﬁne the average value of the rotation curve logarithmic slope,
▽≡(dlogV/dlogR) between two and three Rd. A ﬂat curve means
▽= 0; for an exponential disk without DM, ▽= −0.27 at 3Rs. Ob-
servations show a large range of values for the slope: −0.2 ≤▽≤1
• the rotation curve shape (▽) correlates with the luminosity and
surface brightness of galaxies [95, 123, 132]: it increases according the
galaxy is fainter and of lower surface brightness
• at the optical radius Ropt, the DM–to–baryon ratio varies from
≈1 to 7 for luminous high–surface brightness to faint low–surface
brightness galaxies, respectively
• the roughly smooth shape of the rotation curves implies a ﬁne
coupling between disk and DM halo mass distributions [25]
The HI rotation curves extend typically to 2 −5Ropt. The dynamics at
larger radii can be traced with satellite galaxies if the satellite statistics allows
for that. More recently, the technique of (statistical) weak lensing around

122
Vladimir Avila-Reese
galaxies began to emerge as the most direct way to trace the masses of galaxy
halos. The results show that a typical L∗galaxy (early or late) with a stellar
mass of Ms ≈6 × 1010M⊙is surrounded by a halo of ≈2 × 1012M⊙([80] and
more references therein). The extension of the halo is typically ≈200−250kpc.
These numbers are very close to the determinations for our own Galaxy.
The picture has been conﬁrmed deﬁnitively: luminous galaxies are just
the top of the iceberg (Fig. 3). The baryonic mass of (normal) galaxies is only
∼3 −5% of the DM mass in the halo! This fraction could be even lower for
dwarf galaxies (because of feedback) and for very luminous galaxies (because
the gas cooling time > Hubble time). On the other hand, the universal baryon–
to–DM fraction (ΩB/ΩDM ≈0.04/0.022, see below) is fB,Un ≈18%. Thus,
galaxies are not only dominated by DM, but are much more so than the
average in the Universe! This begs the next question: if the majority of baryons
is not in galaxies, where it is? Recent observations, based on highly ionized
absorption lines towards low redshift luminous AGNs, seem to have found a
fraction of the missing baryons in the interﬁlamentary warm–hot intergalactic
medium at T <
∼105 −107 K [89].

The present–day abundance of baryons in virialized objects (normal stars,
gas, white dwarfs, black holes, etc. in galaxies, and hot gas in clusters) is
therefore ΩB ≈0.0037, which accounts for ≈9% of all the baryons at low
redshifts. The gas in not virialized structures in the Intergalactic Medium
(cold-warm Lyα/β gas clouds and the warm–hot phase) accounts for ≈73%
of all baryons. Instead, at z > 2 more than 88% of the universal baryonic
fraction is in the Lyα forest composed of cold HI clouds. The baryonic budget’s
outstanding question is: Why only ≈9% of baryons are in virialized structures
at the present epoch?
2.3 Ecology
The properties of galaxies vary systematically as a function of environment.
The environment can be relatively local (measured through the number of
nearest neighborhoods) or of large scale (measured through counting in de-
ﬁned volumes around the galaxy). The morphological type of galaxies is ear-
lier in the locally denser regions (morphology–density relation),the fraction
of ellipticals being maximal in cluster cores [40] and enhanced in rich [96]
and poor groups. The extension of the morphology–density relation to low
local–density environment (cluster outskirts, low mass groups, ﬁeld) has been
a matter of debate. From an analysis of SDSS data, it was found that [54]
(i) in the sparsest regions both relations ﬂatten out, (ii) in the intermediate
density regions (e.g., cluster outskirts) the intermediate–type galaxy (mostly

124
Vladimir Avila-Reese
S0s) fraction increases towards denser regions whereas the late–type galaxy
fraction decreases, and (iii) in the densest regions intermediate–type fraction
decreases radically and early–type fraction increases. In a similar way, a study
based on 2dFGRS data of the luminosity functions in clusters and voids shows
that the population of faint late–type galaxies dominates in the latter, while,
in contrast, very bright early–late galaxies are relatively overabundant in the
former [34]. This and other studies suggest that the origin of the morphology–
density (or morphology-radius) relation could be a combination of (i) initial
(cosmological) conditions and (ii) of external mechanisms (ram-pressure and
tidal stripping, thermal evaporation of the disk gas, strangulation, galaxy
harassment, truncated star formation, etc.) that operate mostly in dense en-
vironments, where precisely the relation steepens signiﬁcantly.
The morphology–environment relation evolves. It systematically ﬂattens
with z in the sense that the grow of the early-type (E+S0) galaxy fraction with
density becomes less rapid ([97] and more references therein) the main change
being in the high–density population fraction. Postman et al. conclude that
the observed ﬂattening of the relation up to z ∼1 is due mainly to a deﬁcit
of S0 galaxies and an excess of Sp+Irr galaxies relative to the local galaxy
population; the E fraction-density relation does not appear to evolve over the
range 0 < z < 1.3! Observational studies show that other properties besides
morphology vary with environment. The galaxy properties most sensitive to
environment are the integral color and speciﬁc star formation rate (e.g. [68,
114, 127]. The dependences of both properties on environment extend typically
to lower densities than the dependence for morphology. These properties are
tightly related to the galaxy star formation history, which in turn depends on
internal formation/evolution processes related directly to initial cosmological
conditions as well as to external astrophysical mechanisms able to inhibit or
induce star formation activity.
2.4 Genetics
Galaxies deﬁnitively evolve. We can reconstruct the past of a given galaxy by
matching the observational properties of its stellar populations and ISM with
(parametric) spectro–photo–chemical models (inductive approach). These are
well–established models specialized in following the spectral, photometrical
and chemical evolution of stellar populations formed with diﬀerent gas in-
fall rates and star formation laws (e.g. [16] and the references therein). The
inductive approach allowed to determine that spiral galaxies as our Galaxy
can not be explained with closed–box models (a single burst of star forma-
tion); continuous infall of low–metallicity gas is required to reproduce the local
and global colors, metal abundances, star formation rates, and gas fractions.
On the other hand, the properties of massive ellipticals (specially their high
α-elements/Fe ratios) are well explained by a single early fast burst of star
formation and subsequent passive evolution.

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
125
A diﬀerent approach to the genetical study of galaxies emerged after cos-
mology provided a reliable theoretical background. Within such a background
it is possible to “handle” galaxies as physical objects that evolve according
to the initial and boundary conditions given by cosmology. The deductive
construction of galaxies can be confronted with observations corresponding to
diﬀerent stages of the proto-galaxy and galaxy evolution. The breakthrough
for the deductive approach was the success of the inﬂationary theory and the
consistency of the so–called Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario with parti-
cle physics and observational cosmology. The main goal of these notes is to
describe the ingredients, predictions, and tests of this scenario.
Galaxy Evolution in Action
The dramatic development of observational astronomy in the last 15 years
or so opened a new window for the study of galaxy genesis: the follow up of
galaxy/protogalaxy populations and their environment at diﬀerent redshifts.
The Deep and Ultra Deep Fields of the Hubble Spatial Telescope and other
facilities allowed to discover new populations of galaxies at high redshifts,
as well as to measure the evolution of global (per unit of comoving volume)
quantities associated with galaxies: the cosmic star formation rate density
(SFRD), the cosmic density of neutral gas, the cosmic density of metals, etc.
Overall, these global quantities change signiﬁcantly with z, in particular the
SFRD as traced by the UV–luminosity at rest of galaxies [79]: since z ∼1.5−2
to the present it decreased by a factor close to ten (the Universe is literally
lightening oﬀ), and for higher redshifts the SFRD remains roughly constant or
slightly decreases ([51, 61] and the references therein). There exists indications
that the SFRD at redshifts 2–4 could be approximately two times higher
if considering Far Infrared/submilimetric sources (SCUBA galaxies), where
intense bursts of star formation take place in a dust–obscured phase.
Concerning populations of individual galaxies, the Deep Fields evidence
a signiﬁcant increase in the fraction of blue galaxies at z ∼1 for the blue
sequence that at these epochs look more distorted and with higher SFRs than
their local counterparts. Instead, the changes observed in the red sequence
are small; it seems that most red elliptical galaxies were in place long ago.
At higher redshifts (z >
∼2), galaxy objects with high SFRs become more and
more common. The most abundant populations are:
Lyman Break Galaxies (LBG) , selected via the Lyman break at 912˚A in the
rest–frame. These are star–bursting galaxies (SFRs of 10 −1000M⊙/yr) with
stellar masses of 109 −1011M⊙and moderately clustered.
Sub-millimeter (SCUBA) Galaxies, detected with sub–millimeter bolometer
arrays. These are strongly star–bursting galaxies (SFRs of ∼1000M⊙/yr)
obscured by dust; they are strongly clustered and seem to be merging galaxies,
probably precursors of ellipticals.

126
Vladimir Avila-Reese
Lyman α emitters (LAEs), selected in narrow–band studies centered in the
Lyman α line at rest at z > 3; strong emission Lyman α lines evidence phases
of rapid star formation or strong gas cooling. LAEs could be young (disk?)
galaxies in the early phases of rapid star formation or even before, when the
gas in the halo was cooling and infalling to form the gaseous disk.
Quasars (QSOs), easily discovered by their powerful energetics; they are as-
sociated to intense activity in the nuclei of galaxies that apparently will end
as spheroids; QSOs are strongly clustered and are observed up to z ≈6.5.
There are many other populations of galaxies and protogalaxies at high
redshifts (Luminous Red Galaxies, Damped Lyα disks, Radiogalaxies, etc.).
A major challenge now is to put together all the pieces of the high–redshift
puzzle to come up with a coherent picture of galaxy formation and evolution.
3 Cosmic Structure Formation
In the previous section we have learn that galaxy formation and evolution
are deﬁnitively related to cosmological conditions. Cosmology provides the
theoretical framework for the initial and boundary conditions of the cosmic
structure formation models. At the same time, the confrontation of model
predictions with astronomical observations became the most powerful test-
bed for cosmology. As a result of this fruitful convergence between cosmology
and astronomy, there emerged the current paradigmatic scenario of cosmic
structure formation and evolution of the Universe called Λ Cold Dark Mat-
ter (ΛCDM). The ΛCDM scenario integrates nicely: (1) cosmological theories
(Big Bang and Inﬂation), (2) physical models (standard and extensions of the
particle physics models), (3) astrophysical models (gravitational cosmic struc-
ture growth, hierarchical clustering, gastrophysics), and (4) phenomenology
(CMBR anisotropies, non-baryonic DM, repulsive dark energy, ﬂat geometry,
galaxy properties).
Nowadays, cosmology passed from being the Cinderella of astronomy to
be one of the highest precision sciences. Let us consider only the Inﬂation/Big
Bang cosmological models with the F-R-W metric and adiabatic perturba-
tions. The number of parameters that characterize these models is high,
around 15 to be more precise. No single cosmological probe constrain all of
these parameters. By using multiple data sets and probes it is possible to
constrain with precision several of these parameters, many of which correlate
among them (degeneracy). The main cosmological probes used for precision
cosmology are the CMBR anisotropies, the type–Ia SNe and long Gamma–
Ray Bursts, the Lyα power spectrum, the large–scale power spectrum from
galaxy surveys, the cluster of galaxies dynamics and abundances, the peculiar
velocity surveys, the weak and strong lensing, the baryonic acoustic oscillation
in the large–scale galaxy distribution. There is a model that is systematically
consistent with most of these probes and one of the goals in the last years has

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
127
been to improve the error bars of the parameters for this ‘concordance’ model.
The geometry in the concordance model is ﬂat with an energy composition
dominated in ∼2/3 by the cosmological constant Λ (generically called Dark
Energy), responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the Universe.
The other ∼1/3 is matter, but ∼85% of this 1/3 is in form of non–baryonic
DM. Table 2 presents the central values of diﬀerent parameters of the ΛCDM
cosmology from combined model ﬁttings to the recent 3–year WMAP CMBR
and several other cosmological probes [109] (see the WMAP website).

In the following, I will describe some of the ingredients of the ΛCDM sce-
nario, emphasizing that most of these ingredients are well established aspects
that any alternative scenario to ΛCDM should be able to explain.
3.1 Origin of Fluctuations
The Big Bang4 is now a mature theory, based on well established observational
pieces of evidence. However, the Big Bang theory has limitations. One of
them is namely the origin of ﬂuctuations that should give rise to the highly
inhomogeneous structure observed today in the Universe, at scales of less
than ∼200Mpc. The smaller the scales, the more clustered is the matter.
For example, the densities inside the central regions of galaxies, within the
galaxies, cluster of galaxies, and superclusters are about 1011, 106, 103 and
few times the average density of the Universe, respectively.
The General Relativity equations that describe the Universe dynamics in
the Big Bang theory are for an homogeneous and isotropic ﬂuid (Cosmologi-
cal Principle); inhomogeneities are not taken into account in this theory “by
deﬁnition”. Instead, the concept of ﬂuctuations is inherent to the Inﬂation-
ary theory introduced in the early 80’s by A. Guth and A. Linde namely to
4 It is well known that the name of ‘Big Bang’ is not appropriate for this theory. The
key physical conditions required for an explosion are temperature and pressure
gradients. These conditions contradict the Cosmological Principle of homogeneity
and isotropy on which is based the ‘Big Bang’ theory.

overcome the Big Bang limitations. According to this theory, at the energies
of Grand Uniﬁcation ( >
∼1014GeV or T >
∼1027K!), the matter was in the state
known in quantum ﬁeld theory as vacuum. Vacuum is characterized by quan-
tum ﬂuctuations –temporary changes in the amount of energy in a point in
space, arising from Heisenberg uncertainty principle. For a small time interval
∆t, a virtual particle–antiparticle pair of energy ∆E is created (in the GU
theory, the ﬁeld particles are supposed to be the X- and Y-bosons), but then
the pair disappears so that there is no violation of energy conservation. Time
and energy are related by ∆E∆t ≈
h
2π. The vacuum quantum ﬂuctuations
are proposed to be the seeds of present–day structures in the Universe.
How is that quantum ﬂuctuations become density inhomogeneities? Dur-
ing the inﬂationary period, the expansion is described approximately by the
de Sitter cosmology, a ∝eHt, H ≡˙a/a is the Hubble parameter and it is con-
stant in this cosmology. Therefore, the proper length of any ﬂuctuation grows
as λp ∝eHt. On the other hand, the proper radius of the horizon for de Sitter
metric is equal to c/H =const, so that initially causally connected (quan-
tum) ﬂuctuations become suddenly supra–horizon (classical) perturbations to
the spacetime metric. After inﬂation, the Hubble radius grows proportional
to ct, and at some time a given curvature perturbation cross again the hori-
zon (becomes causally connected, λp < LH). It becomes now a true density
perturbation. The interesting aspect of the perturbation ‘trip’ outside the
horizon is that its amplitude remains roughly constant, so that if the ampli-
tude of the ﬂuctuations at the time of exiting the horizon during inﬂation is
constant (scale invariant), then their amplitude at the time of entering the
horizon should be also scale invariant. In fact, the computation of classical per-
turbations generated by a quantum ﬁeld during inﬂation demonstrates that
the amplitude of the scalar ﬂuctuations at the time of crossing the horizon is
nearly constant, δφH ∝const. This can be understood on dimensional grounds:
due to the Heisenberg principle δφ/δt ∝const, where δt ∝H−1. Therefore,
δφH ∝H, but H is roughly constant during inﬂation, so that δφH ∝const.
3.2 Gravitational Evolution of Fluctuations
The ΛCDM scenario assumes the gravitational instability paradigm: the cos-
mic structures in the Universe were formed as a consequence of the growth of
primordial tiny ﬂuctuations (for example seeded in the inﬂationary epochs)
by gravitational instability in an expanding frame. The ﬂuctuation or pertur-
bation is characterized by its density contrast,
δ ≡δρ
ρ = ρ −ρ
ρ
,
(1)
where ρ is the average density of the Universe and ρ is the perturbation den-
sity. At early epochs, δ << 1 for perturbation of all scales, otherwise the
homogeneity condition in the Big Bang theory is not anymore obeyed. When
δ << 1, the perturbation is in the linear regime and its physical size grows

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
129
with the expansion proportional to a(t). The perturbation analysis in the lin-
ear approximation shows whether a given perturbation is stable (δ ∼const or
even →0) or unstable (δ grows). In the latter case, when δ →1, the linear
approximation is not anymore valid, and the perturbation “separates” from
the expansion, collapses, and becomes a self–gravitating structure. The grav-
itational evolution in the non–linear regime is complex for realistic cases and
is studied with numerical N–body simulations. Next, a pedagogical review of
the linear evolution of perturbations is presented. More detailed explanations
on this subject can be found in the books [72, 94, 90, 30, 77, 92].
Relevant Times and Scales
The important times in the problem of linear gravitational evolution of per-
turbations are: (a) the epoch when inﬂation ﬁnished (tinf ≈10−34s, at this
time the primordial ﬂuctuation ﬁeld is established); (b) the epoch of matter–
radiation equality teq (corresponding to aeq ≈1/3.9×104(Ω0h2), before teq the
dynamics of the universe is dominated by radiation density, after teq dominates
matter density); (c) the epoch of recombination trec, when radiation decouples
from baryonic matter (corresponding to arec = 1/1080, or trec ≈3.8 × 105yr
for the concordance cosmology).
Scales: ﬁrst of all, we need to characterize the size of the perturbation. In
the linear regime, its physical size expands with the Universe: λp = a(t)λ0,
where λ0 is the comoving size, by convention ﬁxed (extrapolated) to the
present epoch, a(t0) = 1. In a given (early) epoch, the size of the pertur-
bation can be larger than the so–called Hubble radius, the typical radius
over which physical processes operate coherently (there is causal connection):
LH ≡(a/˙a)−1 = H−1 = n−1ct. For the radiation or matter dominated cases,
a(t) ∝tn, with n = 1/2 and n = 2/3, respectively, that is n < 1. Therefore,
LH grows faster than λp and at a given “crossing” time tcross, λp < LH. Thus,
the perturbation is supra–horizon sized at epochs t < tcross and sub–horizon
sized at t > tcross. Notice that if n > 1, then at some time the perturbation
“exits” the Hubble radius. This is what happens in the inﬂationary epoch,
when a(t) ∝et: causally–connected ﬂuctuations of any size are are suddenly
“taken out” outside the Hubble radius becoming causally disconnected.
For convenience, in some cases it is better to use masses instead of sizes.
Since in the linear regime δ << 1 (ρ ≈ρ), then M ≈ρM(a)ℓ3, where ℓis the
size of a given region of the Universe with average matter density ρM. The
mass of the perturbation, Mp, is invariant.
Supra–horizon Sized Perturbations
In this case, causal, microphysical processes are not possible, so that it does
not matter what perturbations are made of (baryons, radiation, dark mat-
ter, etc.); they are in general just perturbations to the metric. To study the
gravitational growth of metric perturbations, a General Relativistic analysis
is necessary. A major issue in carrying out this program is that the metric

130
Vladimir Avila-Reese
perturbation is not a gauge invariant quantity. See e.g., [72] for an outline of
how E. Lifshitz resolved brilliantly this diﬃcult problem in 1946. The result is
quite simple and it shows that the amplitude of metric perturbations outside
the horizon grows kinematically at diﬀerent rates, depending on the dominant
component in the expansion dynamics. For the critical cosmological model
(at early epochs all models approach this case), the growing modes of metric
perturbations according to what dominates the background are:
δm,+ ∝a(t) ∝t2/3, .................matter
(2)
δm,+ ∝a(t)2 ∝t, .................radiation
δm,+ ∝a(t)−2 ∝e−2Ht, ..Λ (deSitter)
(3)
Sub–horizon Sized Perturbations
Once perturbations are causally connected, microphysical processes are
switched on (pressure, viscosity, radiative transport, etc.) and the gravita-
tional evolution of the perturbation depends on what it is made of. Now,
we deal with true density perturbations. For them applies the classical per-
turbation analysis for a ﬂuid, originally introduced by J. Jeans in 1902, in
the context of the problem of star formation in the ISM. But unlike in the
ISM, in the cosmological context the ﬂuid is expanding. What can prevent the
perturbation amplitude from growing gravitationally? The answer is pressure
support. If the ﬂuid pressure gradient can re–adjust itself in a timescale tpress
smaller than the gravitational collapse timescale, tgrav, then pressure prevents
the gravitational growth of δ. Thus, the condition for gravitational instability
is:
tgrav ≈
1
(Gρ)1/2 < tpress ≈λp
v ,
(4)
where ρ is the density of the component that is most gravitationally domi-
nant in the Universe, and v is the sound speed (collisional ﬂuid) or velocity
dispersion (collisionless ﬂuid) of the perturbed component. In other words,
if the perturbation scale is larger than a critical scale λJ ∼v(Gρ)−1/2, then
pressure loses, gravity wins.
The perturbation analysis applied to the hydrodynamical equations of a
ﬂuid at rest shows that δ grows exponentially with time for perturbations
obeying the Jeans instability criterion λp > λJ, where the exact value of λJ
is v(π/Gρ)1/2. If λp < λJ, then the perturbations are described by stable
gravito–acustic oscillations. The situation is conceptually similar for pertur-
bations in an expanding cosmological ﬂuid, but the growth of δ in the unstable
regime is algebraical instead of exponential. Thus, the cosmic structure forma-
tion process is relatively slow. Indeed, the typical epochs of galaxy and cluster
of galaxies formation are at redshifts z ∼1 −5 (ages of ∼1.2 −6 Gyrs) and
z < 1 (ages larger than 6 Gyrs), respectively.

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
131
Baryonic matter. The Jeans instability analysis for a relativistic (plasma)
ﬂuid of baryons ideally coupled to radiation and expanding at the rate H =
˙a/a shows that there is an instability critical scale λJ = v(3π/8Gρ)1/2, where
the sound speed for adiabatic perturbations is v = p/ρ = c/
√
3; the latter
equality is due to pressure radiation. At the epoch when radiation dominates,
ρ = ρr ∝a−4 and then λJ ∝a2 ∝ct. It is not surprising that at this epoch
λJ approximates the Hubble scale LH ∝ct (it is in fact ∼3 times larger).
Thus, perturbations that might collapse gravitationally are in fact outside
the horizon, and those that already entered the horizon, have scales smaller
than λJ: they are stable gravito–acoustic oscillations. When matter dominates,
ρ = ρM ∝a−3, and a ∝t2/3. Therefore, λJ ∝a ∝t2/3 <
∼LH, but still radiation
is coupled to baryons, so that radiation pressure is dominant and λJ remains
large. However, when radiation decouples from baryons at trec, the pressure
support drops dramatically by a factor of Pr/Pb ∝nrT/nbT ≈108! Now, the
Jeans analysis for a gas mix of H and He at temperature Trec ≈4000 K shows
that baryonic clouds with masses >
∼106M⊙can collapse gravitationally, i.e. all
masses of cosmological interest. But this is literally too “ideal” to be true.
The problem is that as the Universe expands, radiation cools (Tr = T0a−1)
and the photon–baryon ﬂuid becomes less and less perfect: the mean free path
for scattering of photons by electrons (which at the same time are coupled
electrostatically to the protons) increases. Therefore, photons can diﬀuse out
of the bigger and bigger density perturbations as the photon mean free path
increases. If perturbations are in the gravito–acoustic oscillatory regime, then
the oscillations are damped out and the perturbations disappear. The “iron-
ing out” of perturbations continues until the epoch of recombination. In a
pioneering work, J. Silk [104] carried out a perturbation analysis of a relativis-
tic cosmological ﬂuid taking into account radiative transfer in the diﬀusion
approximation. He showed that all photon–baryon perturbations of masses
smaller than MS are “ironed out” until trec by the (Silk) damping process.
The ﬁrst crisis in galaxy formation theory emerged: calculations showed that
MS is of the order of 1013 −1014M⊙h−1! If somebody (god, inﬂation, ...)
seeded primordial ﬂuctuations in the Universe, by Silk damping all galaxy–
sized perturbation are “ironed out”. 5
Non–baryonic matter. The gravito–acoustic oscillations and their damping by
photon diﬀusion refer to baryons. What happens for a ﬂuid of non–baryonic
DM? After all, astronomers, since Zwicky in the 1930s, ﬁnd routinely pieces
5 In the 1970s Y. Zel’dovich and collaborators worked out a scenario of galaxy for-
mation starting from very large perturbations, those that were not aﬀected by
Silk damping. In this elegant scenario, the large–scale perturbations, considered
in a ﬁrst approximation as ellipsoids, collapse most rapidly along their shortest
axis, forming ﬂattened structures (“pancakes”), which then fragment into galax-
ies by gravitational or thermal instabilities. In this ‘top-down’ scenario, to obtain
galaxies in place at z ∼1, the amplitude of the large perturbations at recombina-
tion should be ≥3 × 10−3. Observations of the CMBR anisotropies showed that
the amplitudes are 1–2 order of magnitudes smaller than those required.

of evidence for the presence of large amounts of DM in the Universe. As
DM is assumed to be collisionless and not interacting electromagnetically,
then the radiative or thermal pressure supports are not important for linear
DM perturbations. However, DM perturbations can be damped out by free
streaming if the particles are relativistic: the geodesic motion of the particles
at the speed of light will iron out any perturbation smaller than a scale close to
the particle horizon radius, because the particles can freely propagate from an
overdense region to an underdense region. Once the particles cool and become
non relativistic, free streaming is not anymore important. A particle of mass
mX and temperature TX becomes non relativistic when kBTX ∼mXc2. Since
TX ∝a−1, and a ∝t1/2 when radiation dominates, one then ﬁnds that the
epoch when a thermal–relic particle becomes non relativistic is tnr ∝m−2
X .

133
The more massive the DM particle, the earlier it becomes non relativistic,
and the smaller are therefore the perturbations damped out by free streaming
(those smaller than ∼ct; see Fig. 4). According to the epoch when a given
thermal DM particle species becomes non relativistic, DM is called Cold Dark
Matter (CDM, very early), Warm Dark Matter (WDM, early) and Hot Dark
Matter (HDM, late)6.
The only non–baryonic particles conﬁrmed experimentally are (light) neu-
trinos (HDM). For neutrinos of masses ∼1 −10eV, free streaming attains to
iron out perturbations of scales as large as massive clusters and superclus-
ters of galaxies (see Fig. 4). Thus, HDM suﬀers the same problem of bary-
onic matter concerning galaxy formation7. At the other extreme is CDM, in
which case survive free streaming practically all scales of cosmological inter-
est. This makes CDM appealing to galaxy formation theory. In the minimal
CDM model, it is assumed that perturbations of all scales survive, and that
CDM particles are collisionless (they do not self–interact). Thus, if CDM
dominates, then the ﬁrst step in galaxy formation study is reduced to the
calculation of the linear and non–linear gravitational evolution of collisionless
CDM perturbations. Galaxies are expected to form in the centers of collapsed
CDM structures, called halos, from the baryonic gas, ﬁrst trapped in the
gravitational potential of these halos, and second, cooled by radiative (and
turbulence) processes (see §5).
The CDM perturbations are free of any physical damping processes and
in principle their amplitudes may grow by gravitational instability. However,
when radiation dominates, the perturbation growth is stagnated by expansion.
The gravitational instability timescale for sub–horizon linear CDM perturba-
tions is tgrav ∼(GρDM)−2, while the expansion (Hubble) timescale is given by
texp ∼(Gρ)−2. When radiation dominates, ρ ≈ρr and ρr >> ρM. Therefore
texp << tgrav, that is, expansion is faster than the gravitational shrinking.
Fig. 5 resumes the evolution of primordial perturbations. Instead of spa-
tial scales, in Fig. 5 are shown masses, which are invariant for the pertur-
bations. We highlight the following conclusions from this plot: (1) Photon–
baryon perturbations of masses < MS are washed out (δB →0) as long
as baryon matter is coupled to radiation. (2) The amplitude of CDM per-
turbations that enter the horizon before teq is “freezed-out” (δDM ∝const)
as long as radiation dominates; these are perturbations of masses smaller
than MH,eq ≈1013(ΩMh2)−2M⊙, namely galaxy scales. (3) The baryons are
trapped gravitationally by CDM perturbations, and within a factor of two
in z, baryon perturbations attain amplitudes half that of δDM. For WDM

The reference to “early” and “late” is given by the epoch and the corre-
sponding radiation temperature when the largest galaxy–sized perturbations

based on solar neutrino oscillations. Therefore, neutrinos contribute to the matter

The processed power spectrum of perturbations. The exact solution to the
problem of linear evolution of cosmological perturbations is much more com-
plex than the conceptual aspects described above. Starting from a primordial
ﬂuctuation ﬁeld, the perturbation analysis should be applied to a cosmolog-
ical mix of baryons, radiation, neutrinos, and other non–baryonic dark mat-
ter components (e.g., CDM), at sub– and supra–horizon scales (the ﬂuid as-
sumption is relaxed). Then, coupled relativistic hydrodynamic and Boltzmann
equations in a general relativity context have to be solved taking into account
radiative and dissipative processes. The outcome of these complex calculations
is the full description of the processed ﬂuctuation ﬁeld at the recombination
epoch (when ﬂuctuations at almost all scales are still in the linear regime).
The goal is double and of crucial relevance in cosmology and astrophysics:

1) to predict the physical and statistical properties of CMBR anisotropies,
which can be then compared with observations, and 2) to provide the initial
conditions for calculating the non–linear regime of cosmic structure formation
and evolution. Fortunately, there are now several public friendly-to-use codes
that numerically solve the cosmological linear perturbation equations (e.g.,
CMBFast and CAMB 8).
The description of the density ﬂuctuation ﬁeld is statistical. As any random
ﬁeld, it is convenient to study perturbations in the Fourier space. The Fourier
expansion of δ(x) is:
δ(x) =
V
(2π)3

δke−ikxd3k,
(5)
δk = V −1

δ(x)eikxd3x
(6)
The Fourier modes δk evolve independently while the perturbations are in
the linear regime, so that the perturbation analysis can be applied to this
quantity. For a Gaussian random ﬁeld, any statistical quantity of interest can
be speciﬁed in terms of the power spectrum P(k) ≡|δk|2, which measures
the amplitude of the ﬂuctuations at a given scale k9. Thus, from the linear
perturbation analysis we may follow the evolution of P(k). A more intuitive
quantity than P(k) is the mass variance σ2
M ≡⟨(δM/M)2
R⟩of the ﬂuctuation
ﬁeld. The physical meaning of σM is that of an rms density contrast on a
given sphere of radius R associated to the mass M = ρVW (R), where W(R)
is a window (smoothing) function. The mass variance is related to P(k). By
assuming a power law power spectrum, P(k) ∝kn, it is easy to show that
σM ∝R−(3+n) ∝M −(3+n)/3 = M −2α

for 4 < n < −3 using a Gaussian window function. The question is: How the
scaling law of perturbations, σM, evolves starting from an initial (σM)i?
In the early 1970s, Harrison and Zel’dovich independently asked them-
selves about the functionality of σM (or the density contrast) at the time
adiabatic perturbations cross the horizon, that is, if (σM)H ∝M αH, then
what is the value of αH? These authors concluded that −0.1 ≤αH ≤0.2, i.e.

9 The phases of the Fourier modes in the Gaussian case are uncorrelated. Gaus-
sianity is the simplest assumption for the primordial ﬂuctuation ﬁeld statistics
and it seems to be consistent with some variants of inﬂation. However, there are
other variants that predict non–Gaussian ﬂuctuations (for a recent review on this
subject see e.g. [8]), and the observational determination of the primordial ﬂuc-
tuation statistics is currently an active ﬁeld of investigation. The properties of
cosmic structures depend on the assumption about the primordial statistics, not
only at large scales but also at galaxy scales; see for a review and new results [4].

αH ≈0 (nH ≈−3). If αH >> 0 (nH >> −3), then σM →∞for M →0; this
means that for a given small mass scale M, the mass density of the perturba-
tion at the time of becoming causally connected can correspond to the one of a
(primordial) black hole. Hawking evaporation of black holes put a constraint
on MBH,prim
<
∼1015g, which corresponds to αH ≤0.2, otherwise the γ–ray
background radiation would be more intense than that observed. If αH << 0
(nH << −3), then larger scales would be denser than the small ones, contrary
to what is observed. The scale–invariant Harrison–Zel’dovich power spectrum,
PH(k) ∝k−3, is for perturbations at the time of entering the horizon. How
should the primordial power spectrum Pi(k) = Akn
i or (σM)i = BM −αi (de-
ﬁned at some ﬁxed initial time) be to produce such scale invariance? Since ti
until the horizon crossing time tcross(M) for a given perturbation of mass M,
σM(t) evolves as a(t)2 (supra–horizon regime in the radiation era). At tcross,
the horizon mass MH is equal by deﬁnition to M. We have seen that MH ∝a3
(radiation dominion), so that across ∝M 1/3
H
= M 1/3. Therefore,
σM(tcross) ∝(σM)i(across/ai)2 ∝M −αiM 2/3,
(8)
i.e. αH = 2/3 −αi or nH = ni −4. A similar result is obtained if the pertur-
bation enters the horizon during the matter dominion era. From this analysis
one concludes that for the perturbations to be scale invariant at horizon cross-
ing (αH = 0 or nH = −3), the primordial (initial) power spectrum should be
Pi(k) = Ak1 or (σM)i ∝M −2/3 ∝λ−2
0
(i.e. ni = 1 and α = 2/3; A is a nor-
malization constant). Does inﬂation predict such power spectrum? We have
seen that, according to the quantum ﬁeld theory and assuming that H =const
during inﬂation, the ﬂuctuation amplitude is scale invariant at the time to exit
the horizon, δH ∼const. On the other hand, we have seen that supra–horizon
curvature perturbations during a de Sitter period evolve as δ ∝a−2 (eq. 4).
Therefore, at the end of inﬂation we have that δinf = δH(λ0)(ainf/aH)−2. The
proper size of the ﬂuctuation when crossing the horizon is λp = aHλ0 ≈H−1;
therefore, aH ≈1/(λ0H). Replacing now this expression in the equation for
δinf we get that:
δinf ≈δH(λ0)(ainfλ0H)−2 ∝λ−2
0
∝M −2/3,
(9)
if δH ∼const. Thus, inﬂation predicts αi nearly equal to 2/3 (ni ≈1)! Recent
results from the analysis of CMBR anisotropies by the WMAP satellite [109]
seem to show that ni is slightly smaller than 1 or that ni changes with the
scale (running power–spectrum index). This is in more agreement with several
inﬂationary models, where H actually slightly vary with time introducing
some scale dependence in δH.
The perturbation analysis, whose bases were presented in §3.2 and resumed
in Fig. 5, show us that σM grows (kinematically) while perturbations are in the
supra–horizon regime. Once perturbations enter the horizon (ﬁrst the smaller
ones), if they are made of CDM, then the gravitational growth is “freezed
out” whilst radiation dominates (stangexpantion). As shown schematically

Fig. 6. Linear evolution of the perturbation mass variance σM. The perturbation
amplitude in the supra–horizon regime grow kinematically. DM perturbations (solid
curve) that cross the horizon during the radiation dominion, freeze–out their grow
due to stangexpantion, producing a ﬂattening in the scaling law σM for all scales
smaller than the corresponding to the horizon at the equality epoch (galaxy scales).
Baryon–photon perturbations smaller than the Silk mass MS are damped out (dot-
ted curve) and those larger than MS but smaller than the horizon mass at recom-
bination are oscillating (Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation, BAO).
in Fig. 6, this “ﬂattens” the variance σM at scales smaller than MH,eq; in
fact, σM ∝ln(M) at these scales, corresponding to galaxies! After teq the
CDM variance (or power spectrum) grows at the same rate at all scales. If
perturbations are made out of baryons, then for scales smaller than MS, the
gravito–acoustic oscillations are damped out, while for scales close to the
Hubble radius at recombination, these oscillations are present. The “ﬁnal”
processed mass variance or power spectrum is deﬁned at the recombination
epoch. For example, the power spectrum is expressed as:
Prec(k) = Akni × (D(trec)/D(ti))2 × T 2(k),
(10)
where the ﬁrst term is the initial power spectrum Pi(k); the second one is
how much the ﬂuctuation amplitude has grown in the linear regime (D(t) is
the so–called linear growth factor), and the third one is a transfer function
that encapsulates the diﬀerent damping and freezing out processes able to
deform the initial power spectrum shape. At large scales, T 2(k) = 1, i.e. the
primordial shape is conserved (see Fig. 6).
Besides the mass power spectrum, it is possible to calculate the angu-
lar power spectrum of temperature ﬂuctuation in the CMBR. This spectrum
consists basically of 2 ranges divided by a critical angular scales: the an-
gle θh corresponding to the horizon scale at the epoch of recombination

((LH)rec ≈200(Ωh2)−1/2 Mpc, comoving). For scales grander than θh the
spectrum is featureless and corresponds to the scale–invariant supra–horizon
Sachs-Wolfe ﬂuctuations. For scales smaller than θh, the sub–horizon ﬂuctu-
ations are dominated by the Doppler scattering (produced by the gravito–
acoustic oscillations) with a series of decreasing in amplitude peaks; the po-
sition (angle) of the ﬁrst Doppler peak depends strongly on Ω, i.e. on the
geometry of the Universe. In the last 15 years, high–technology experiments
as COBE, Boomerang, WMAP provided valuable information (in particular
the latter one) on CMBR anisotropies. The results of this exciting branch of
astronomy (called sometimes anisotronomy) were of paramount importance
for astronomy and cosmology (see for a review [62] and the W. Hu website10).
Just to highlight some of the key results of CMBR studies, let us mention
the next ones: 1) detailed predictions of the ΛCDM scenario concerning the
linear evolution of perturbations were accurately proved, 2) several cosmolog-
ical parameters as the geometry of the Universe, the baryonic fraction ΩB,
and the index of the primordial power spectrum, were determined with high
precision (see the actualized, recently delivered results from the 3 year analy-
sis of WMAP in [109]), 3) by studying the polarization maps of the CMBR it
was possible to infer the epoch when the Universe started to be signiﬁcantly
reionized by the formation of ﬁrst stars, 4) the amplitude (normalization) of
the primordial ﬂuctuation power spectrum was accurately measured. The lat-
ter is crucial for further calculating the non–linear regime of cosmic structure
formation. I should emphasize that while the shape of the power spectrum is
predicted and well understood within the context of the ΛCDM model, the
situation is fuzzy concerning the power spectrum normalization. We have a
phenomenological value for A but not a theoretical prediction.
4 The Dark Side of Galaxy Formation and Evolution
A great triumph of the ΛCDM scenario was the overall consistency found
between predicted and observed CMBR anisotropies generated at the recom-
bination epoch. In this scenario, the gravitational evolution of CDM pertur-
bations is the driver of cosmic structure formation. At scales much larger than
galaxies, (i) mass density perturbations are still in the (quasi)linear regime,
following the scaling law of primordial ﬂuctuations, and (ii) the dissipative
physics of baryons does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the matter distribution. Thus,
the large–scale structure (LSS) of the Universe is determined basically by
DM perturbations yet in their (quasi)linear regime. At smaller scales, non–
linearity strongly aﬀects the primordial scaling law and, moreover, the dissi-
pative physics of baryons “distorts” the original DM distribution, particularly
inside galaxy–sized DM halos. However, DM in any case provides the original
“mold” where gas dynamics processes take place.

The ΛCDM scenario describes successfully the observed LSS of the Uni-
verse (for reviews see e.g., [49, 58], and for some recent observational results
see e.g. [115, 102, 109]). The observed ﬁlamentary structure can be explained
as a natural consequence of the CDM gravitational instability occurring pref-
erentially in the shortest axis of 3D and 2D protostructures (the Zel’dovich
panckakes). The clustering of matter in space, traced mainly by galaxies, is
also well explained by the clustering properties of CDM. At scales r much
larger than typical galaxy sizes, the galaxy 2-point correlation function ξgal(r)
(a measure of the average clustering strength on spheres of radius r) agrees
rather well with ξCDM(r). Current large statistical galaxy surveys as SDSS
and 2dFGRS, allow now to measure the redshift–space 2-point correlation
function at large scales with unprecedented accuracy, to the point that weak
“bumps” associated with the baryon acoustic oscillations at the recombination
epoch begin to be detected [41]. At small scales ( <
∼3Mpch−1), ξgal(r) departs
from the predicted pure ξCDM(r) due to the emergence of two processes: (i)
the strong non–linear evolution that small scales underwent, and (ii) the com-
plexity of the baryon processes related to galaxy formation. The diﬀerence
between ξgal(r) and ξCDM(r) is parametrized through one “ignorance” para-
meter, b, called bias, ξgal(r) = bξCDM(r). Below, some basic ideas and results
related to the former processes will be described. The baryonic process will
be sketched in the next Section.
4.1 Nonlinear Clustering Evolution
The scaling law of the processed ΛCDM perturbations, is such that σM at
galaxy–halo scales decreases slightly with mass (logarithmically) and for larger
scales, decreases as a power law (see Fig. 6). Because the perturbations of
higher amplitudes collapse ﬁrst, the ﬁrst structures to form in the ΛCDM
scenario are typically the smallest ones. Larger structures assemble from the
smaller ones in a process called hierarchical clustering or bottom–up mass
assembling. It is interesting to note that the concept of hierarchical clustering
was introduced several years before the CDM paradigm emerged. Two seminal
papers settled the basis for the current theory of galaxy formation: Press &
Schechter 1974 [98] and White & Rees 1979 [131]. In the latter it was proposed
that “the smaller–scale virialized [dark] systems merge into an amorphous
whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas
in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires suﬃcient concentration to
self–gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size”.
The Press & Schechter (P-S) formalism was developed to calculate the
mass function (per unit of comoving volume) of halos at a given epoch,
n(M, z). The starting point is a Gaussian density ﬁeld ﬁltered (smoothed)
at diﬀerent scales corresponding to diﬀerent masses, the mass variance σM
being the characterization of this ﬁltering process. A collapsed halo is iden-
tiﬁed when the evolving density contrast of the region of mass M, δM(z),

140
Vladimir Avila-Reese
attains a critical value, δc, given by the spherical top–hat collapse model11.
This way, the Gaussian probability distribution for δM is used to calculate
the mass distribution of objects collapsed at the epoch z. The P-S formalism
assumes implicitly that the only objects to be counted as collapsed halos at a
given epoch are those with δM(z) = δc. For a mass variance decreasing with
mass, as is the case for CDM models, this implies a “hierarchical” evolution
of n(M, z): as z decreases, less massive collapsed objects disappear in favor
of more massive ones (see Fig. 8). The original P-S formalism had an error of
2 in the sense that integrating n(M, z) half of the mass is lost. The authors
multiplied n(M, z) by 2, argumenting that the objects duplicate their masses
by accretion from the sub–dense regions. The problem of the factor of 2 in the
P-S analysis was partially solved using an excursion set statistical approach
[17, 73].
To get an idea of the typical formation epochs of CDM halos, the spheri-
cal collapse model can be used. According to this model, the density contrast
of given overdense region, δ, grows with z proportional to the growing fac-
tor, D(z), until it reaches a critical value, δc, after which the perturbation is
supposed to collapse and virialize12. at redshift zcol (for example see [90]):
δ(zcol) ≡δ0D(zcol) = δc,0.
(11)
The convention is to ﬁx all the quantities to their linearly extrapolated values
at the present epoch (indicated by the subscript “0”) in such a way that D(z =
0) ≡D0 = 1. Within this convention, for an Einstein–de Sitter cosmology,
δc,0 = 1.686, while for the ΛCDM cosmology, δc,0 = 1.686Ω0.0055

, and the
growing factor is given by
D(z) =
g(z)
g(z0)(1 + z),
(12)
11 The spherical top–hat model refers to the exact calculation of the collapse of
a uniform spherical density perturbation in an otherwise uniform Universe; the
dynamics of such a region is the same of a closed Universe. The solution of the
equations of motion shows that the perturbation at the beginning expands as the
background Universe (proportional to a), then it reaches a maximum expansion
(size) in a time tmax, and since that moment the perturbation separates of the
expanding background, collapsing in a time tcol = 2tmax.
12 The mathematical solution gives that the spherical perturbed region collapses
into a point (a black hole) after reaching its maximum expansion. However, real
perturbations are lumpy and the particle orbits are not perfectly radial. In this
situation, during the collapse the structure comes to a dynamical equilibrium un-
der the inﬂuence of large scale gravitational potential gradients, a process named
by the oxymoron “violent relaxation” (see e.g. [14]); this is a typical collective
phenomenon. The end result is a system that satisﬁes the virial theorem: for
a self–gravitating system this means that the internal kinetic energy is half the
(negative) gravitational potential energy. Gravity is supported by the velocity dis-
persion of particles or lumps. The collapse factor is roughly 1/2, i.e. the typical
virial radius Rv of the collapsed structure is ≈0.5 the radius of the perturbation
at its maximum expansion.

ΩM,0 (1 + z)3. For the Einstein–de Sitter model, D(z) = (1 + z). We need
now to connect the top–hat sphere results to a perturbation of mass M. The
processed perturbation ﬁeld, ﬁxed at the present epoch, is characterized by the
mass variance σM and we may assume that δ0 = νσM, where δ0 is δ linearly
extrapolated to z = 0, and ν is the peak height. For average perturbations, ν =
1, while for rare, high–density perturbations, from which the ﬁrst structures
arose, ν >> 1. By introducing δ0 = νσM into eq. (11) one may infer zcol
for a given mass. Fig. 7 shows the typical zcol of 1σ, 2σ, and 3σ halos. The
collapse of galaxy–sized 1σ halos occurs within a relatively small range of
redshifts. This is a direct consequence of the “ﬂattening” suﬀered by σM
during radiation–dominated era due to stangexpansion (see §3.2). Therefore,
in a ΛCDM Universe it is not expected to observe a signiﬁcant population of
galaxies at z >

The problem of cosmological gravitational clustering is very complex due
to non–linearity, lack of symmetry and large dynamical range. Analytical
and semi–analytical approaches provide illuminating results but numerical
N–body simulations are necessary to tackle all the aspects of this problem. In
the last 20 years, the “industry” of numerical simulations had an impressive
development. The ﬁrst cosmological simulations in the middle 80s used a few
104 particles (e.g., [36]). The currently largest simulation (called the Mille-

142
Vladimir Avila-Reese
nium simulation [111]) uses ∼1010 particles! A main eﬀort is done to reach
larger and larger dynamic ranges in order to simulate encompassing volumes
large enough to contain representative populations of all kinds of halos (low
mass and massive ones, in low– and high–density environments, high–peak
rare halos), yet resolving the inner structure of individual halos.
Halo Mass Function
The CDM halo mass function (comoving number density of halos of diﬀerent
masses at a given epoch z, n(M, z)) obtained in the N–body simulations is
consistent with the P-S function in general, which is amazing given the ap-
proximate character of the P-S analysis. However, in more detail, the results
of large N–body simulations are better ﬁtted by modiﬁed P-S analytical func-
tions, as the one derived in [103] and showed in Fig. 8. Using the Millennium
simulation, the halo mass function has been accurately measured in the range
that is well sampled by this run (z ≤12, M ≥1.7 × 1010M⊙h−1). The mass
function is described by a power law at low masses and an exponential cut–oﬀ
at larger masses. The “cut-oﬀ”, most typical mass, increases with time and
is related to the hierarchical evolution of the 1σ halos shown in Fig. 7. The
halo mass function is the starting point for modeling the luminosity func-
tion of galaxies. From Fig. 8 we see that the evolution of the abundances of
massive halos is much more pronounced than the evolution of less massive
halos. This is why observational studies of abundance of massive galaxies or
cluster of galaxies at high redshifts provide a sharp test to theories of cosmic
structure formation. The abundance of massive rare halos at high redshifts
are for example a strong function of the ﬂuctuation ﬁeld primordial statistics
(Gaussianity or non-Gaussianity).
Subhalos. An important result of N–body simulations is the existence of sub-
halos, i.e. halos inside the virial radius of larger halos, which survived as
self–bound entities the gravitational collapse of the higher level of the hier-
archy. Of course, subhalos suﬀer strong mass loss due to tidal stripping, but
this is probably not relevant for the luminous galaxies formed in the inner-
most regions of (sub)halos. This is why in the case of subhalos, the maximum
circular velocity Vm (attained at radii much smaller than the virial radius) is
used instead of the virial mass. The Vm distribution of subhalos inside cluster–
sized and galaxy–sized halos is similar [83]. This distribution agrees with the
distribution of galaxies seen in clusters, but for galaxy–sized halos the number
of subhalos overwhelms by 1–2 orders of magnitude the observed number of
satellite galaxies around galaxies like Milky Way and Andromeda [70, 83].
Fig. 9 (right side) shows the subhalo cumulative Vm−distribution for a
CDM Milky Way–like halo compared to the observed satellite Vm−distribution.
In this Fig. are also shown the Vm−distributions obtained for the same Milky–
Way halo but using the power spectrum of three WDM models with particle
masses mX ≈0.6, 1, and 1.7 KeV. The smaller mX, the larger is the free–
streaming (ﬁltering) scale, Rf, and the more substructure is washed out (see

§3.2). In the left side of Fig. 9 is shown the DM distribution inside the Milky–
Way halo simulated by using a CDM power spectrum (top) and a WDM
power spectrum with mX ≈1KeV (sterile neutrino, bottom). For a student it
should be exciting to see with her(his) own eyes this tight connection between
micro– and macro–cosmos: the mass of the elemental particle determines the
structure and substructure properties of galaxy halos!
Halo Density Proﬁles
High–resolution N–body simulations [87] and semi–analytical techniques (e.g.,
[3]) allowed to answer the following questions: How is the inner mass distrib-
ution in CDM halos? Does this distribution depend on mass? How universal
is it? The two–parameter density proﬁle established in [87] (the Navarro-
Frenk-White, NFW proﬁle) departs from a single power law, and it was
proposed to be universal and not depending on mass. In fact the slope
β(r) ≡−dlogρ(r)/dlogr of the NFW proﬁle changes from −1 in the cen-
ter to −3 in the periphery. The two parameters, a normalization factor, ρs
and a shape factor, rs, were found to be related in a such a way that the proﬁle
depends only on one shape parameter that could be expressed as the concen-
tration, cNF W ≡rs/Rv. The more massive the halo, the less concentrated on
the average. For the ΛCDM model, c ≈20−5 for M ∼2×108−2×1015M⊙h−1,
respectively [42]. However, for a given M, the scatter of cNF W is large
(≈30 −40%), and it is related to the halo formation history [3, 22, 125] (see

are typically not relaxed or disturbed by companions or external tidal forces.
Is there a “cusp” crisis? More recently, it was found that the inner density
proﬁle of halos can be steeper than β = −1 (e.g. [84]). However, it was shown
that in the limit of resolution, β never is as steep a −1.5 [88]. The inner
structure of CDM halos can be tested in principle with observations of (i) the
inner rotation curves of DM dominated galaxies (Irr dwarf and LSB galaxies;
in dwarf and LSB galaxies has a roughly constant density core, in contrast
to the cuspy cores of CDM halos (the literature on this subject is extensive;
see for recent results [37, 50, 107, 128] and more references therein). If the
either astrophysical mechanisms able to expand the halo cores should work
eﬃciently or the ΛCDM scenario should be modiﬁed. In the latter case, one of
the inner velocity dispersion of dSph galaxies is also being used as a test),

the possibilities is to introduce weakly self–interacting DM particles. For small
cross sections, the interaction is eﬀective only in the more dense inner regions
of galaxies, where heat inﬂow may expand the core. However, the gravo–
thermal catastrophe can also be triggered. In [32] it was shown that in order to
avoid the gravo–thermal instability and to produce shallow cores with densities
approximately constant for all masses, as suggested by observations, the DM
cross section per unit of particle mass should be σDM/mX = 0.5 −1.0v−1

cm2/gr, where v100 is the relative velocity of the colliding particles in unities
of 100 km/s; v100 is close to the halo maximum circular velocity, Vm.
The DM mass distribution was inferred from the rotation curves of dwarf
and LSB galaxies under the assumptions of circular motion, halo spherical
symmetry, the lack of asymmetrical drift, etc. In recent studies it was discussed
that these assumptions work typically in the sense of lowering the observed
inner rotation velocity [59, 100, 118]. For example, in [118] it is demonstrated
that non-circular motions (due to a bar) combined with gas pressure support
and projection eﬀects systematically underestimate by up to 50% the rotation
velocity of cold gas in the central 1 kpc region of their simulated dwarf galaxies,
creating the illusion of a constant density core.
Mass–velocity relation. In a very simplistic analysis, it is easy to ﬁnd that
M ∝V 3
c if the average halo density ρh does not depend on mass. On one
hand, Vc ∝(GM/R)1/2, and on the other hand, ρh ∝M/R3, so that Vc ∝
M 1/3ρ1/6
h . Therefore, for ρh =const, M ∝V 3
c . We have seen in §3.2 that
the CDM perturbations at galaxy scales have similar amplitudes (actually
σM ∝lnM) due to the stangexpansion eﬀect in the radiation–dominated era.
This implies that galaxy–sized perturbations collapse within a small range
of epochs attaining more or less similar average densities. The CDM halos
actually have a mass distribution that translates into a circular velocity proﬁle
Vc(r). The maximum of this proﬁle, Vm, is typically the circular velocity that
characterizes a given halo of virial mass M. Numerical and semi–numerical
results show that (ΛCDM model):

amazingly similar to the observed infrared Tully–Fisher relation [116], one of
the most robust and intriguingly correlations in the galaxy world! I conclude
that this relation is a clear imprint of the CDM power spectrum of ﬂuctuations.
Mass Assembling Histories
One of the key concepts of the hierarchical clustering scenario is that cos-
mic structures form by a process of continuous mass aggregation, opposite to
the monolithic collapse scenario. The mass assembly of CDM halos is charac-
terized by the mass aggregation history (MAH), which can alternate smooth

146
Vladimir Avila-Reese
mass accretion with violent major mergers. The MAH can be calculated by
using semi–analytical approaches based on extensions of the P-S formalism.
The main idea lies in the estimate of the conditional probability that given a
collapsed region of mass M0 at z0, a region of mass M1 embedded within the
volume containing M0, had collapsed at an earlier epoch z1. This probability
is calculated based on the excursion set formalism starting from a Gaussian
density ﬁeld characterized by an evolving mass variance σM[17, 73]. By us-
ing the conditional probability and random trials at each temporal step, the
“backward” MAHs corresponding to a ﬁxed mass M0 (deﬁned for instance at
z = 0) can be traced. The MAHs of isolated halos by deﬁnition decrease to-
ward the past, following diﬀerent tracks (Fig. 10), sometimes with abrupt big
jumps that can be identiﬁed as major mergers in the halo assembly history.

To characterize typical behaviors of the halo MAHs, one may calculate the
average MAH for a given virial mass M0, for a given “population” of halos
selected by its environment, etc. In the left panels of Fig. 10 are shown 20
individual MAHs randomly selected from 104 trials for M0 = 3.5×1011M⊙in
a ΛCDM cosmology [45]. In the bottom panel are plotted the average MAH
from these 104 trials as well as two extreme deviations from the average. The
average MAHs depend on mass: more massive halos have a more extended
average MAH, i.e. they aggregate a given fraction of M0 latter than less mas-
sive halos. It is a convention to deﬁne the typical halo formation redshift, zf,
when half of the current halo mass M0 has been aggregated. For instance, for
the ΛCDM cosmology the average MAHs show that zf ≈2.2, 1.2 and 0.7 for
M0 = 1010M⊙, 1012M⊙and 1014M⊙, respectively. A more physical deﬁnition
of halo formation time is when the halo maximum circular velocity Vm attains
its maximum value. After this epoch, the mass can continue growing, but the
inner gravitational potential of the system is already set.
Right panels of Fig. 10 show the present–day halo circular velocity pro-
ﬁles, Vc(r), corresponding to the MAHs plotted in the left panels. The average
Vc(r) is well described by the NFW proﬁle. There is a direct relation between
the MAH and the halo structure as described by Vc(r) or the concentration
parameter. The later the MAH, the more extended is Vc(r) and the less con-
centrated is the halo [3, 125]. Using high–resolution simulations some authors
have shown that the halo MAH presents two regimes: an early phase of fast
mass aggregation (mainly by major mergers) and a late phase of slow aggre-
gation (mainly by smooth mass accretion) [133, 75]. The potential well of a
present–day halo is set mainly at the end of the fast, major–merging driven,
growth phase.
From the MAHs we may infer: (i) the mass aggregation rate evolution of
halos (halo mass aggregated per unit of time at diﬀerent z′s), and (ii) the ma-
jor merging rates of halos (number of major mergers per unit of time per halo
at diﬀerent z′s). These quantities should be closely related to the star forma-
tion rates of the galaxies formed within the halos as well as to the merging of
luminous galaxies and pair galaxy statistics. By using the ΛCDM model, sev-
eral studies showed that most of the mass of the present–day halos has been
aggregated by accretion rather than major mergers (e.g., [85]). Major merg-
ing was more frequent in the past [55], and it is important for understanding
the formation of massive galaxy spheroids and the phenomena related to this
process like QSOs, supermassive black hole growth, obscured star formation
bursts, etc. Both the mass aggregation rate and major merging rate histories
depend strongly on environment: the denser the environment, the higher is
the merging rate in the past. However, in the dense environments (group and
clusters) form typically structures more massive than in the less dense regions
(ﬁeld and voids). Once a large structure virializes, the smaller, galaxy–sized
halos become subhalos with high velocity dispersions: the mass growth of the
subhalos is truncated, or even reversed due to tidal stripping, and the merging
probability strongly decreases. Halo assembling (and therefore, galaxy assem-

148
Vladimir Avila-Reese
bling) deﬁnitively depends on environment. Overall, by integrating the MAHs
of the whole galaxy–sized ΛCDM halo population in a given volume, the gen-
eral result is that the peak in halo assembling activity was at z ≈1 −2. After
these redshifts, the global mass aggregation rate strongly decreases (e.g., [121].
To illustrate the driving role of DM processes in galaxy evolution, I men-
tion brieﬂy here two concrete examples:
1). Distributions of present–day speciﬁc mass aggregation rate, ( ˙M/M)0,
and halo lookback formation time, T1/2. For a ΛCDM model, these distri-
butions are bimodal, in particular the former. We have found that roughly
40% of halos (masses larger than ≈1011M⊙h−1) have ( ˙M/M)0 ≤0; they
are basically subhalos. The remaining 60% present a broad distribution of
( ˙M/M)0 > 0 peaked at ≈0.04Gyr−1. Moreover, this bimodality strongly
changes with large–scale environment: the denser is the environment the,
higher is the fraction of halos with ( ˙M/M)0 ≤0. It is interesting enough
that similar fractions and dependences on environment are found for the spe-
ciﬁc star formation rates of galaxies in large statistical surveys (§§2.3); the
situation is similar when confronting the distributions of T1/2 and observed
colors. Therefore, it seems that the the main driver of the observed bimodal-
ities in z = 0 speciﬁc star formation rate and color of galaxies is the nature
of the CDM halo mass aggregation process. Astrophysical processes of course
are important but the main body of the bimodalities can be explained just at
the level of DM processes.
2. Major merging rates. The observational inference of galaxy major merg-
ing rates is not an easy task. The two commonly used methods are based on
the statistics of galaxy pairs (pre–mergers) and in the morphological distor-
tions of ellipticals (post–mergers). The results show that the merging rate
increases as (1 + z)x, with x ∼0 −4. The predicted major merging rates in
the ΛCDM scenario agree roughly with those inferred from statistics of galaxy
pairs. From the fraction of normal galaxies in close companions (with sepa-
rations less than 50 kpch−1) inferred from observations at z = 0 and z = 0.3
[91], and assuming an average merging time of ∼1 Gyr for these separations,
we estimate that the major merging rate at the present epoch is ∼0.01 Gyr−1
for halos in the range of 0.1 −2.0 1012M⊙, while at z = 0.3 the rate increased
to ∼0.018 Gyr−1. These values are only slightly lower than predictions for
the ΛCDM model.
Angular Momentum
The origin of the angular momentum (AM) is a key ingredient in theories of
galaxy formation. Two mechanisms of AM acquirement were proposed for the
CDM halos (e.g., [93, 23, 78]): 1. tidal torques of the surrounding shear ﬁeld
when the perturbation is still in the linear regime, and 2. transfer of orbital AM
to internal AM in major and minor mergers of collapsed halos. The angular
momentum of DM halos is parametrized in terms of the dimensionless spin
parameter λ ≡J
√
E/(GM 5/2, where J is the modulus of the total angular

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
149
momentum and E is the total (kinetic plus potential). It is easy to show that λ
can be interpreted as the level of rotational support of a gravitational system,
λ = ω/ωsup, where ω is the angular velocity of the system and ωsup is the
angular velocity needed for the system to be rotationally supported against
gravity (see [90]).
For disk and elliptical galaxies, λ ∼0.4−0.8 and ∼0.01−0.05, respectively.
Cosmological N–body simulations showed that the CDM halo spin parameter
is log–normal distributed, with a median value λ ≈0.04 and a standard de-
viation σλ ≈0.5; this distribution is almost independent from cosmology. A
related quantity, but more straightforward to compute is λ′ ≡
J
√
2MVvRv [23],
where Rv is the virial radius and Vv the circular velocity at this radius. Recent
simulations show that (λ′, σλ′) ≈(0.035, 0.6), though some variations with en-
vironment and mass are measured [5]. The evolution of the spin parameter
depends on the AM acquirement mechanism. In general, a signiﬁcant system-
atical change of λ with time is not expected, but relatively strong changes are
measured in short time steps, mainly after merging of halos, when λ increases.
How is the internal AM distribution in CDM halos? Bullock et al. [23]
found that in most of cases this distribution can be described by a simple
(universal) two–parameter function that departs signiﬁcantly from the solid–
body rotation distribution. In addition, the spatial distribution of AM in
CDM halos tends to be cylindrical, being well aligned for 80% of the halos, and
misaligned at diﬀerent levels for the rest. The mass distribution of the galaxies
formed within CDM halos, under the assumption of speciﬁc AM conservation,
is established by λ, the halo AM distribution, and its alignment.
4.2 Non–baryonic Dark Matter Candidates
The non–baryonic DM required in cosmology to explain observations and cos-
mic structure formation should be in form of elemental or scalar ﬁeld particles
or early formed quark nuggets. Modiﬁcations to fundamental physical theories
(modiﬁed Newtonian Dynamics, extra–dimensions, etc.) are also plausible if
DM is not discovered.
There are several docens of predicted elemental particles as DM candi-
dates. The list is reduced if we focus only on well–motivated exotic particles
from the point of view of particle physics theory alone (see for a recent review
[53]). The most popular particles beyond the standard model are the super-
symmetric (SUSY) particles in supersymmetric extensions of the Standard
Model of particle physics. Supersymmetry is a new symmetry of space–time
introduced in the process of unifying the fundamental forces of nature (includ-
ing gravity). An excellent CDM candidate is the lightest stable SUSY particle
under the requirement that superpartners are only produced or destroyed in
pairs (called R-parity conservation). This particle called neutralino is weakly
interacting and massive (WIMP). Other SUSY particles are the gravitino and
the sneutrino; they are of WDM type. The predicted masses for neutralino
range from ∼30 to 5000 GeV. The cosmological density of neutralino (and of

150
Vladimir Avila-Reese
other thermal WIMPs) is naturally as required when their interaction cross
section is of the order of a weak cross section. The latter gives the possibility
to detect neutralinos in laboratory.
The possible discovery of WIMPs relies on two main techniques:
(i) Direct detections. The WIMP interactions with nuclei (elastic scattering)
in ultra–low–background terrestrial targets may deposit a tiny amount of en-
ergy (< 50 keV) in the target material; this kinetic energy of the recoiling
nucleus is converted partly into scintillation light or ionization energy and
partly into thermal energy. Dozens of experiments worldwide -of cryogenic
or scintillator type, placed in mines or underground laboratories, attempt to
measure these energies. Predicted event rates for neutralinos range from 10−6
to 10 events per kilogram detector material and day. The nuclear recoil spec-
trum is featureless, but depends on the WIMP and target nucleus mass. To
convincingly detect a WIMP signal, a speciﬁc signature from the galactic halo
particles is important. The Earth’s motion through the galaxy induces both a
seasonal variation of the total event rate and a forward–backward asymmetry
in a directional signal. The detection of structures in the dark velocity space,
as those predicted to be produced by the Sagittarius stream, is also an speciﬁc
signature from the Galactic halo; directional detectors are needed to measure
this kind of signatures.
The DAMA collaboration reported a possible detection of WIMP particles
obeying the seasonal variation; the most probable value of the WIMP mass
was ∼60 GeV. However, the interpretation of the detected signal as WIMP
particles is controversial. The sensitivity of current experiments (e.g., CDMS
and EDEL-WEISS) limit already the WIMP–proton spin–independent cross
sections to values
<
∼2 10−42 −10−40cm−2 for the range of masses ∼50 −104
GeV, respectively; for smaller masses, the cross–section sensitivities are larger,
and WIMP signals were not detected. Future experiments will be able to test
the regions in the cross-section–WIMP mass diagram, where most of models
make certain predictions.
(ii) Indirect detections. We can search for WIMPS by looking for the prod-
ucts of their annihilation. The ﬂux of annihilation products is proportional
to the square of the WIMP density, thus regions of interest are those where
the WIMP concentration is relatively high. There are three types of searches
according to the place where WIMP annihilation occur: (i) in the Sun or the
Earth, which gives rise to a signal in high-energy neutrinos; (ii) in the galactic
halo, or in the halo of external galaxies, which generates γ−rays and other
cosmic rays such as positrons and antiprotons; (iii) around black holes, spe-
cially around the black hole at the Galactic Center. The predicted radiation
ﬂuxes depend on the particle physics model used to predict the WIMP candi-
date and on astrophysical quantities such as the dark matter halo structure,
the presence of sub–structure, and the galactic cosmic ray diﬀusion model.
Most of WIMPS were in thermal equilibrium in the early Universe (thermal
relics). Particles which were produced by a non-thermal mechanism and that

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
151
never had the chance of reaching thermal equilibrium are called non-thermal
relics (e.g., axions, solitons produced in phase transitions, WIMPZILLAs pro-
duced gravitationally at the end of inﬂation). From the side of WDM, the most
popular candidate are the ∼1KeV sterile neutrinos. A sterile neutrino is a
fermion that has no standard model interactions other than a coupling to the
standard neutrinos through their mass generation mechanism. Cosmological
probes, mainly the power spectrum of Lyα forest at high redshifts, constrain
the mass of the sterile neutrino to values larger than ∼2KeV.
5 The Bright Side of Galaxy Formation and Evolution
The ΛCDM scenario of cosmic structure formation has been well tested for
perturbations that are still in the linear or quasilinear phase of evolution.
These tests are based, among other cosmological probes, on accurate mea-
surements of:
• the CMBR temperature ﬂuctuations at large and small angular scales
• the large–scale mass power spectrum as traced by the spatial distribu-
tion of galaxies and cluster of galaxies, by the Lyα forest clouds, by maps of
gravitational weak and strong lensing, etc.
• the peculiar large–scale motions of galaxies13.
• the statistics of strong gravitational lensing (multiple–lensed arcs).
Although these cosmological probes are based on observations of lumi-
nous (baryonic) objects, the physics of baryons plays a minor or indirect role
in the properties of the linear mass perturbations. The situation is diﬀerent
at small (galaxy) scales, where perturbations went into the non–linear regime
and the dissipative physics of baryons becomes relevant. The interplay of DM
and baryonic processes is crucial for understanding galaxy formation and evo-
lution. The progress in this ﬁeld was mostly heuristic; the ΛCDM scenario
provides the initial and boundary conditions for modeling galaxy evolution,
but the complex physics of the baryonic processes, in the absence of funda-
mental theories, requires a model adjustment through confrontation with the
observations.
Following, I will outline some key concepts, ingredients, and results of the
galaxy evolution study based on the ΛCDM scenario. Some of the pioneer pa-
pers in this ﬁeld are those of Gunn [57], White & Reese [131], Fall & Efstathiou
[43], Blumental et al. [15], Davis et al. [36], Katz & Gunn [65], White & Frenk
[130], Kauﬀmann et al. [66]. For useful lecture notes and recent reviews see
e.g., Longair [76, 77], White [129], Steinmetz [113], Firmani & Avila-Reese
[46].
13 Recall that linear theory relates the peculiar velocity, that is the velocity deviation
from the Hubble ﬂow, to the density contrast. It is said that the cosmological
velocity ﬁeld is potential; any primordial rotational motion able to give rise to a
density perturbation decays as the Universe expands due to angular momentum
conservation.

Vladimir Avila-Reese
The main methods of studying galaxy formation and evolution in the
ΛCDM context are:
• Semi-analytical Models (e.g., [130, 66, 28, 9, 108, 29, 12, 10]), where
the halo mass assembling histories are calculated with the extended Press–
Schechter formalism and galaxies are seeded within the halos by means of
phenomenological recipes. This method is very useful for producing whole
populations of galaxies at a given epoch and predicting statistical properties
as the luminosity function and the morphological mix.
• Semi-numerical Models (e.g, [45, 2, 119, 16]), where the internal physics
of the galaxies, including those of the halos, are modeled numerically but
under simplifying assumptions; the initial and boundary conditions are taken
from the ΛCDM scenario by using the extended Press–Schechter formalism
and halo AM distributions from simulations. This method is useful to predict
the local properties of galaxies and correlations among the global properties,
as well as to follow the overall evolution of individual galaxies.
• Numerical N–body+hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., [65, 27, 64, 86,
112, 126, 1, 110, 56]), where the DM and baryonic processes are followed in
cosmological simulations. This is the most advanced and complete approach to
galaxy evolution. However, current limitations in the computational capabili-
ties and the lack of fundamental theories for several of the physical processes
involved, do not allow yet to exploit optimally this method. A great advance
is being made currently with an hybrid approach: in the high–resolution cos-
mological N–body simulations of only DM, galaxies are grafted by using the
semi–analytical models (e.g., [67, 60, 38, 13, 111, 63]).
5.1 Disks
The formation of galaxy disks deep inside the CDM halos is a generic process
in the ΛCDM scenario. Let us outline the (simpliﬁed) steps of disk galaxy
formation in this scenario:
1. DM halo growth. The “mold” for disk formation is provided by the mass
and AM distributions of the virialized halo, which grows hierarchically. A
description of these aspects were presented in the previous Section.
2. Gas cooling and infall, and the maximum mass of galaxies. It is common
to assume that the gas in a halo is shock–heated during collapse to the virial
temperature [131]. The gas then cools radiatively and falls in a free–fall time
to the center. The cooling function Λ(n, Tk; Z) depends on the gas density,
temperature, and composition14. Since the seminal work by White & Frenk
(1990) [130], the rate infall of gas available to form the galaxy is assumed to
14 The main cooling processes for the intrahalo gas are collisional excitation and
ionization, recombination, and bremsstrahlung. The former is the most eﬃcient
for kinetic temperatures Tk ≈104−105K and for neutral hydrogen and single ion-
ized helium; for a meta–enriched gas, cooling is eﬃcient at temperatures between
105 −107K. At higher temperatures, where the gas is completely ionized, the

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
153
be driven either by the free–fall time, tff, if tff > tcool or by the cooling time
tcool if tff < tcool. The former case applies to halos of masses smaller than
approximately 5×1011M⊙, whilst the latter applies to more massive halos. The
cooling ﬂow from the quasistatic hot atmosphere is the process that basically
limits the baryonic mass of galaxies [105], and therefore the bright end of the
galaxy luminosity function; for the outer, dilute hot gas in large halos, tcool
becomes larger than the Hubble time. However, detailed calculations show
that even so, in massive halos too much gas cools, and the bright end of the
predicted luminosity function results with a decrease slower than the observed
one [12]. Below we will see some solutions proposed to this problem.
More recently it was shown that the cooling of gas trapped in ﬁlaments
during the halo collapse may be so rapid that the gas ﬂows along the ﬁlaments
to the center, thus avoiding shock heating [69]. However, this process is eﬃ-
cient only for halos less massive than 2.5×1011M⊙, which in any case (even if
shock–heating happens), cool their gas very rapidly [19]. Thus, for modeling
the formation of disks, and for masses smaller than ∼5 × 1011M⊙, we may
assume that gas infalls in a dynamical time since the halo has virialized, or in
two dynamical times since the protostructure was at its maximum expansion.
3. Disk formation, the origin of exponentially, and rotation curves. The gas,
originally distributed in mass and AM as the DM, cools and collapses until
it reaches centrifugal balance in a disk. Therefore, assuming detailed AM
conservation, the radial mass distribution of the disk can be calculated by
equating its speciﬁc AM to the AM of its ﬁnal circular orbit in centrifugal
equilibrium. The typical collapse factor of the gas within a DM halo is ∼
10 −1515, depending on the initial halo spin parameter λ; the higher the λ,
the more extended (lower surface density) is the resulting disk. The surface
density proﬁle of the disks formed within CDM halos is nearly exponential,
which provides an explanation to the long–standing question of why galaxy
disks are exponential. This is a direct consequence of the AM distribution
acquired by the halos by tidal torques and mergers. In more detail, however,
the proﬁles are more concentrated in the center and with a slight excess in the
periphery than the exponential law [45, 23]. The cusp in the central disk could
give rise to either a photometrical bulge [120] or to a real kinematical bulge due
to disk gravitational instability enhanced by the higher central surface density
[2] (bulge secular formation). In a few cases (high–λ, low–concentrated halos),
purely exponential disks can be formed.
Baryons are a small mass fraction in the CDM halos, however, the disk
formed in the center is very dense (recall the high collapse factors), so that
dominant cooling process is bremsstrahlung. At temperatures lower than 104K
(small halos) and in absence of metals, the main cooling process is by H2 and
HD molecule line emission.
15 It is interesting to note that in the absence of a massive halo around galaxies, the
collapse factor would be larger by ∼M/Md ≈20, where M and Md are the total
halo and disk masses, respectively [90].

the contribution of the baryonic disk to the inner gravitational potential is
important or even dominant. The formed disk will drag gravitationally DM,
producing an inner halo contraction that is important to calculate for obtain-
ing the rotation curve decomposition. The method commonly used to calculate
it is based on the approximation of radial adiabatic invariance, where spher-
ical symmetry and circular orbits are assumed (e.g., [47, 82]). However, the
orbits in CDM halos obtained in N–body simulations are elliptical rather than
circular; by generalizing the adiabatic invariance to elliptical orbits, the halo
contraction becomes less eﬃcient [132, 52].
The rotation curve decomposition of disks within contracted ΛCDM halos
are in general consistent with observations [82, 45, 132] (nearly–ﬂat total ro-
tation curves; maximum disk for high–surface brightness disks; submaximum
disk for the LSB disks; in more detail, the outer rotation curve shape depends
on surface density, going from decreasing to increasing at the disk radius for
higher to lower densities, respectively). However, there are important non–
solved issues. For example, from a large sample of observed rotation curves,
Persic et al. [95] inferred that the rotation curve shapes are described by an
“universal” proﬁle that (i) depends on the galaxy luminosity and (ii) implies
a halo proﬁle diﬀerent from the CDM (NFW) proﬁle. Other studies conﬁrm
only partially these claims [123, 132, 26]. Statistical studies of rotation curves
are very important for testing the ΛCDM scenario.
In general, the structure and dynamics of disks formed within ΛCDM halos
under the assumption of detailed AM conservation seem to be consistent with
observations. An important result to remark is the successful prediction of the
infrared Tully–Fisher relation and its scatter16. The core problem mentioned
in §4.2 is the most serious potential diﬃculty. Other potential diﬃculties are:
(i) the predicted disk size (surface brightness) distribution implies a P(λ)
distribution narrower than that corresponding to ΛCDM halos by almost a
factor of two [74]; (ii) the internal AM distribution inferred from observations
of dwarf galaxies seems not to be in agreement with the ΛCDM halo AM
distribution [122]; (iii) the inference of the halo proﬁle from the statistical
study of rotation curve shapes seems not to be agreement with CMD halos.
In N–body+hydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxy formation there was
common another diﬃculty called the ‘angular momentum catastrophe’: the
simulated disks ended too much concentrated, apparently due to AM trans-
ference of baryons to DM during the gas collapse. The formation of highly con-
centrated disks also aﬀects the shape of the rotation curve (strongly decreas-
ing), as well as the zero–point of the Tully–Fisher relation. Recent numerical
16 In §4.1 we have shown that the basis of the Tully–Fisher relation is the CDM halo
M −Vm relation. From the pure halo to the disk+halo system there are several
intermediate processes that could distort the original M −Vm relation. However,
it was shown that the way in which the CDM halo couples with the disk and the
way galaxies transform their gas into stars “conspire” to keep the relation. Due
to this conspiring, the Tully–Fisher relation is robust to variations in the baryon
fraction fB (or mass–to–luminosity ratios) and in the spin parameter λ [45].

simulations are showing that the ‘angular momentum catastrophe’, rather
than a physical problem, is a problem related to the resolution of the simula-
tions and the correct inclusion of feedback eﬀects.
4. Star formation and feedback. We are coming to the less understood and
most complicated aspects of the models of galaxy evolution, which deserve
separate notes. The star formation (SF) process is studied at two levels (each
one by two separated communities!): (i) the small–scale physics, related to the
complex processes by which the cold gas inside molecular clouds fragments and
collapses into stars, and (ii) the large–scale physics, related to the disk global
instabilities that give rise to the largest unities of SF, the molecular clouds.
The SF physics incorporated to galaxy evolution models is still oversimpli-
ﬁed, phenomenological and refers to the latter item. The large-scale SF cycle
in normal galaxies is believed to be self–regulated by a balance between the
energy injection due to SF (mainly SNe) and dissipation (radiative or turbu-
lent). Two main approaches have been used to describe the SF self–regulation
in models of galaxy evolution: (a) the halo cooling-feedback approach [130]),
(b) the disk turbulent ISM approach [44, 124].
According to the former, the cool gas is reheated by the “galaxy” SF feed-
back and driven back to the intrahalo medium until it again cools radiatively
and collapses into the galaxy. This approach has been used in semi–analytical
models of galaxy formation where the internal structure and hydrodynamics
of the disks are not treated in detail. The reheating rate is assumed to depend
on the halo circular velocity Vc:
˙Mrh ∝
˙Ms/V α
c , where
˙Ms is the SF rate
(SFR) and α ≥2. Thus, the galaxy SFR, gas fraction and luminosity depend
on Vc. In these models, the disk ISM is virtually ignored and the SN–energy
injection is assumed to be as eﬃcient as to reheat the cold gas up to the virial
temperature of the halo. A drawback of the model is that it predicts hot X-ray
halos around disk galaxies much more luminous than those observed.
Approach (b) is more appropriate for models where the internal processes
of the disk are considered. In this approach, the SF at a given radius r is
assumed to be triggered by disk gravitational instabilities (Toomre criterion)
and self–regulated by a balance between energy injection (mainly by SNe)
and dissipation in the turbulent ISM in the direction perpendicular to the
disk plane:
Qg(r) ≡vg(r)κ(r)
πGΣg(r) < Qcrit
(15)
γSNϵSN ˙Σ∗(r) + ˙ΣE,accr(r) = Σg(r)v2
g(r)
2td(r)
,
(16)
where vg and Σg are the gas velocity dispersion and surface density, κ is
the epicyclic frequency, Qcrit is a critical value for instability, γSN and ϵSN
are the kinetic energy injection eﬃciency of the SN into the gas and the
SN energy generated per gram of gas transformed into stars, respectively,
˙Σ∗is the surface SFR, and ˙ΣE,accr is the kinetic energy input due to mass

accretion rate (or eventually any other energy source as AGN feedback). The
key parameter in the self–regulating process is the dissipation time td. The
disk ISM is a turbulent, non-isothermal, multi-temperature ﬂow. Turbulent
dissipation in the ISM is typically eﬃcient (td ∼107−108yr) in such a way that
self–regulation happens at the characteristic vertical scales of the disk. Thus,
there is not too much room for strong feedback with the gas at heights larger
than the vertical scaleheigth of normal present–day disks: self–regulation is
at the level of the disk, but not at the level of the gas corona around. With
this approach the predicted SFR is proportional to Σn
g (Schmidt law), with
n ≈1.4 −2 varying along the disk, in good agreement with observational
inferences. The typical SF timescales are not longer than 3−4Gyr. Therefore,
to keep active SFRs in the disks, gas infall is necessary, a condition perfectly
fulﬁlled in the ΛCDM scenario.
Given the SFR radius by radius and time by time, and assuming an IMF,
the corresponding luminosities in diﬀerent color bands can be calculated with
stellar population synthesis models. The ﬁnal result is then an evolving inside–
out luminous disk with deﬁned global and local colors.
5. Secular Evolution The “quiet” evolution of galaxy disks as described above
can be disturbed by minor mergers (satellite accretion) and interactions with
close galaxy companions. However, as several studies have shown, the disk may
suﬀer even intrinsic instabilities which lead to secular changes in its structure,
dynamics, and SFR. The main eﬀects of secular evolution, i.e. dynamical
processes that act in a timescale longer than the disk dynamical time, are the
vertical thickening and “heating” of the disk, the formation of bars, which are
eﬃcient mechanisms of radial AM and mass redistribution, and the possible
formation of (pseudo)bulges (see for recent reviews [71, 33]). Models of disk
galaxy evolution should include these processes, which also can aﬀect disk
properties, for example increasing the disk scale radii [117].
5.2 Spheroids
As mentioned in §2, the simple appearance, the dominant old stellar popu-
lations, the α–elements enhancement, and the dynamically hot structure of
spheroids suggest that they were formed by an early (z >
∼4) single violent event
with a strong burst of star formation, followed by passive evolution of their
stellar population (monolithic mechanism). Nevertheless, both observations
and theory point out to a more complex situation. There are two ways to de-
ﬁne the formation epoch of a spheroid: when most of its stars formed or when
the stellar spheroid acquired its dynamical properties in violent or secular
processes. For the monolithic collapse mechanism both epochs coincide.
In the context of the ΛCDM scenario, spheroids are expected to be formed
basically as the result of major mergers of disks. However,

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
157
• if the major mergers occur at high redshifts, when the disks are
mostly gaseous, then the situation is close to the monolithic collapse;
• if the major mergers occur at low redshifts, when the galaxies
have already transformed a large fraction of their gas into stars, then
the spheroids assemble by the “classical” dissipationless collision.
Besides, stellar disks may develop spheroids in their centers (bulges) by
secular evolution mechanisms, both intrinsic or enhanced by minor mergers
and interactions; this channel of spheroid formation should work for late–
type galaxies and it is supported by a large body of observations [71]. But
the picture is even more complex in the hierarchical cosmogony as galaxy
morphology may be continuously changing, depending on the MAH (smooth
accretion and violent mergers) and environment. An spheroid formed early
should continue accreting gas so that a new, younger disk grows around.
A naive expectation in the context of the ΛCDM scenario is that massive
elliptical galaxies should be assembled mainly by late major mergers of the
smaller galaxies in the hierarchy. It is also expected that the disks in galaxies
with small bulge–to–disk ratios should be on average redder than those in
galaxies with large bulge–to–disk ratios, contrary to observations.
Although it is currently subject of debate, a more elaborate picture of
spheroid formation is emerging now in the context of the ΛCDM hierarchical
scenario (see [106, 46, 39] and the references therein). The basic ideas are
that massive ellipticals formed early (z >
∼3) and in a short timescale by the
merging of gas–rich disks in rare high–peak, clustered regions of the Universe.
The complex physics of the merging implies (i) an ultraluminous burst of SF
obscured by dust (cool ULIRG phase) and the establishment of a spheroidal
structure, (ii) gas collapse to the center, a situation that favors the growth of
the preexisting massive black hole(s) through an Eddington or even super–
Eddington regime (warm ULIRG phase), (iii) the switch on of the AGN activ-
ity associated to the supermassive black hole when reaching a critical mass,
reverting then the gas inﬂow to gas outﬂow (QSO phase), (iv) the switch oﬀ
of the AGN activity leaving a giant stellar spheroid with a supermassive black
hole in the center and a hot gas corona around (passive elliptical evolution).
In principle, the hot corona may cool by cooling ﬂows and increase the mass
of the galaxy, likely renewing a disk around the spheroid. However, it seems
that recurrent AGN phases (less energetic than the initial QSO phase) are
possible during the life of the spheroid. Therefore, the energy injected from
AGN in the form of radio jets (feedback) can be responsible for avoiding the
cooling ﬂow. This way is solved the problem of disk formation around the
elliptical, as well as the problem of the extended bright end in the luminosity
function. It is also important to note that as soon as the halo hosting the
elliptical becomes a subhalo of the group or cluster, the MAH is truncated
(§4). According to the model just described, massive elliptical galaxies were
in place at high redshifts, while less massive galaxies (collapsing from more
common density peaks) assembled later. This model was called downsizing or

158

anti-hierarchical. In spite of the name, it ﬁts perfectly within the hierarchical
ΛCDM scenario.
5.3 Drivers of the Hubble Sequence
• Disks are generic objects formed by gas dissipation and collapse inside the
growing CDM halos. Three (cosmological) initial and boundary conditions
related to the halos deﬁne the main properties of disks in isolated halos:
1. The virial mass, which determines extensive properties
2. The spin parameter λ, which determines mainly the disk surface
brightness (SB; it gives rise to the sequence from high SB to low SB
disks) and strongly inﬂuences the rotation curve shape and the bulge–
to–disk ratio (within the secular scenario). λ also plays some role in
the SFR history.
3. The MAH, which drives the gas infall rate and, therefore, the
disk SFR and color; the MAH determines also the halo concentration,
and its scatter is reﬂected in the scatter of the Tully–Fisher relation.
The two latter determine the intensive properties of disks, suggesting a
biparametrical sequence in SB and color. There is a fourth important pa-
rameter, the galaxy baryon fraction fB, which inﬂuences the disk SB and
rotation curve shape. We have seen that fB in galaxies is 3–5 times lower
than the universal ΩB/ΩDM fraction. This parameter is related probably to
astrophysical processes as gas dissipation and feedback.
• The clustering of CDM halos follows an spatial distribution with very
diﬀerent large–scale environments. In low–density environments, halos live
mostly isolated, favoring the formation of disks, whose properties are driven
by the factors mentioned above. However, as we move to higher–density envi-
ronments, halos form from more and more clustered high–peak perturbations
that assemble early by violent major mergers: this is the necessary condition
to form massive ellipticals. At some time, the larger scale in the hierarchy col-
lapses and the halo becomes a subhalo: the mass aggregation is then truncated
and the probability of merging decreases dramatically. Elliptical galaxies are
settled and continue evolving passively. Thus, the environment of CDM halos
is another important driver of the Hubble sequence, able to establish the main
body of the observed blue–red and early–type morphology sequences and their
dependences on density.
• Although the initial, boundary and environmental conditions provided
by the ΛCDM scenario are drivers of several of the main properties and cor-
relations of galaxies, astrophysical processes should also play an important
role. The driving astrophysical processes are global SF and feedback. They
should come in two modes that drive the disk and elliptical sequences: (i)
the quiescent disk mode, where disk instabilities trigger SF and local (nega-
tive) feedback self–regulates the SFR, and (ii) the bursting mode of violent
mergers of gaseous galaxies, where local shocks and gravothermal catastrophe
trigger SF, and presumably a positive feedback increases its eﬃciency. Other

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
159
important astrophysical drivers of galaxy properties are: (i) the SN–induced
wind–driven outﬂows, which are important to shape the properties of dwarf
galaxies (M <
∼1010M⊙, Vm
<
∼80km/s), (ii) the AGN–induced hydrodynamical
outﬂows, which are important to prevent cooling ﬂows in massive ellipticals,
(iii) several processes typical of high–density environments such as ram pres-
sure, harassment, strangulation, etc., presumably important to shape some
properties of galaxies in clusters.
6 Issues and Outlook
Our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is in its infancy. So far,
only the ﬁrst steps were given in the direction of consolidating a theory in
this ﬁeld. The process is apparently so complex and non–linear that several
specialists do not expect the emergence of a theory in the sense that a few
driving parameters and factors might explain the main body of observations.
Instead, the most popular trend now is to attain some description of galaxy
evolution by simulating it in expensive computational runs. I believe that
simulations are a valuable tool to extend a bridge between reality and the
distorted (biased) information given by observations. However, the search of
basic theories for explaining galaxy formation and evolution should not be
replaced by the only eﬀort of simulating in detail what in fact we want to get.
The power of science lies in its predictive capability. Besides, if galaxy theory
becomes predictive, then its potential to test fundamental and cosmological
theories will be enormous.
Along this notes, potential diﬃculties or unsolved problems of the ΛCDM
scenario were discussed. Now I summarize and complement them:
Physics
• What is non–baryonic DM? From the structure formation side, the preferred
(and necessary!) type is CDM, though WDM with ﬁltering masses below ∼
109M⊙is also acceptable. So far none of the well–motivated cold or warm non–
baryonic particles have been detected in Earth experiments. The situation is
even worth for proposals not based on elemental particles as DM from extra–
dimensions.
• What is Dark Energy? Dark Energy does not play apparently a signif-
icant role in the internal evolution of perturbations but it crucially deﬁnes
the cosmic timescale and expansion rate, which are important for the grow-
ing factor of perturbations. The simplest interpretation of Dark Energy is the
homogeneous and inert cosmological constant Λ, with equation of state pa-
rameter w = −1 and ρΛ =const. The combinations of diﬀerent cosmological
probes tend to favor the ﬂat-geometry Λ models with (ΩM, ΩΛ)≈(0.26, 0.74).
However, the cosmological constant explanation of Dark Energy faces serious
theoretical problems. Several alternatives to Λ were proposed to ameliorate

160
Vladimir Avila-Reese
partially these problems (e.g. quintaessence, k–essence, Chaplygin gas, etc.).
Also have been proposed unifying schemes of DM and Dark Energy through
scalar ﬁelds (e.g, [81]).
Cosmology
• Inﬂation provides a natural mechanism for the generation of primordial
ﬂuctuations. The nearly scale–invariance of the primordial power spectrum is
well predicted by several inﬂation models, but its amplitude, rather than being
predicted, is empirically inferred from observations of CMBR anisotropies.
Another aspect of primordial ﬂuctuations not well understood is related to
their statistics, i.e., whether they are Gaussian–distributed or not. And this
is crucial for cosmic structure formation.
• Indirect pieces of evidence are consistent with the main predictions of
inﬂation regarding primordial ﬂuctuations. However, more direct tests of this
theory are highly desirable. Hopefully, CMBR anisotropy observations will
allow for some more direct tests (e.g., eﬀects from primordial gravitational
waves).
Astrophysics
• Issues at small scales. The excess of substructure (satellite galaxies) can
be apparently solved by inhibition of galaxy formation in small halos due to
UV–radiation produced by reionization and due to feedback, rather than to
modiﬁcations to the scenario (e.g., the introduction of WDM). Observational
inferences of the inner volume and phase–space densities of dwarf satellite
galaxies are crucial to explore this question. The direct detection (with gravi-
tational lensing) of the numerous subhalo (dark galaxy) population predicted
by CDM for the Galaxy halo is a decisive test on the problem of substruc-
ture. The CDM prediction of cuspy halos is a more involved problem when
confronting it with observational inferences. If the disagreement persists, then
either the ΛCDM scenario will need a modiﬁcation (e.g., introduction of self–
interaction or annihilation), or astrophysical processes involving gas baryon
physics should be in action. However, there are still unsolved issues at the
intermediate level: for example, the central halo density proﬁle of galaxies is
inferred from observations of inner rotation curves under several assumptions
that could be incorrect. An interesting technique to overcome this problem
is being currently developed: to simulate as realistically as possible a given
galaxy, “observe” its rotation curve and then compare with that of the real
galaxy (see §§4.1).
• The early formation of massive red elliptical galaxies can be accommo-
dated in the hierarchical ΛCDM scenario (§§5.2) if spheroids are produced by
the major merger of gaseous disks, and if the cold gas is transformed rapidly
into stars during the merger in a dynamical time or so. Both conditions should
be demonstrated, in particular the latter. A kind of positive feedback seems

Understanding Galaxy Formation and Evolution
161
to be necessary for such an eﬃcient star formation rate (ISM shocks produced
by the jets generated in the vicinity of supermassive black holes?).
• Once the elliptical has formed early, the next diﬃculty is how to avoid
further (disk) growth around it. The problem can be partially solved by con-
sidering that ellipticals form typically in dense, clustered environments, and
at some time they become substructures of larger virialized groups or clusters,
truncating any possible accretion to the halo/galaxy. However, (i) galaxy ha-
los, even in clusters, are ﬁlled with a reservoir of gas, and (ii) there are some
ellipticals in the ﬁeld. Therefore, negative feedback mechanisms are needed to
stop gas cooling and accretion. AGN–triggered radio jets have been proposed
as a possible mechanism, but further investigation is necessary.
• The merging mechanism of bulge formation within the hierarchical model
implies roughly bluer (later formed) disks as the bulge–to–disk ratio is larger,
contrary to the observed trend. The secular scenario could solve this problem
but it is not still clear whether bars disolve or not in favor of pseudobulges. It
is not clear also if the secular scenario could predict the central supermassive
black hole mass–velocity dispersion relation.
• We lack a fundamental theory of star formation. So far, simple models,
or even just phenomenological recipes, have been used in galaxy formation
studies. The two proposed modes of star formation (the quiescent, ineﬃcient,
disk self–regulated regime, and the violent eﬃcient star–bursting regime in
mergers) are oversimpliﬁcations of a much more complex problem with more
physical mechanisms (shocks, turbulence, etc.). Closely related to star forma-
tion is the problem of feedback. The feedback mechanisms are diﬀerent in the
ISM of disks, in the gaseous medium of merging galaxies with a powerful en-
ergy source (the AGN) other than stars, and in the diluted and hot intrahalo
medium around galaxies.
• We have seen in §§2.2 that at the present epoch only ≈9% of baryons
are within virialized structures. Where are the remaining 91% of the baryons?
The fraction of particles in halos measured in ΛCDM N–body cosmological
simulations is ∼50%. This sounds good but still we have to explain, within
the ΛCDM scenario, the ∼40% of missing baryons. The question is were
these baryons never trapped by collapsed halos or were they trapped but
later expelled due to galaxy feedback. Large–scale N–body+hydrodynamical
simulations have shown that the gravitational collapse of ﬁlaments may heat
the gas and keep a big fraction of baryons outside the collapsed halos [35].
Nevertheless, feedback mechanisms, especially at high redshifts, are also pre-
dicted to be strong enough as to expel enriched gas back to the Intergalactic
Medium. The problem is open.
The ﬁeld has plenty of open and exciting problems. The ΛCDM scenario
has survived many observational tests but it still faces the diﬃculties typical
of a theory constructed phenomenologically and heuristically. Even if in the
future it is demonstrated that CDM does not exist (which is little probable),
the ΛCDM scenario would serve as an excellent “ﬁtting” model to reality,
which would strongly help researchers in developing new theories.

Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays: From GeV to
ZeV

1 Introduction
Cosmic ray (CR) particles arrive at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere at
a rate of around 103 per square meter per second. They are mostly ionized
nuclei - about 90% protons, 9% alpha particles traces of heavier nuclei and
approximately 1% electrons. CRs are characterized by their high energies:
most cosmic rays are relativistic, having kinetic energies comparable to or
somewhat greater than their rest masses. A very few of them have ultra-
relativistic energies extending beyond 1020 eV (tens of joules).
In this lecture we will give an overview of the main experimental char-
acteristics of the cosmic ray ﬂux and their astrophysical signiﬁcance with a
particular emphasis on the higher end of the spectrum. Unfortunately, due
to space limitations, only a fraction of the content of the lectures is included
in the present manuscript. In particular, the production mechanisms are not
included and the fundamental topic of anisotropies is only dealt with in a very
superﬁcial way.
2 Energy Spectrum
Thus, the cosmic ray energy spectrum extends, amazingly, for more than
eleven orders of magnitude. All along this vast energy span, the spectrum
follows a power law of index ∼2.7. Therefore, the CR ﬂux decreases approx-
imately 30 orders of magnitude from ∼103 m2sec−1 at few GeV to ∼1 km−2
per century at 100 EeV.
The only spectral features are a slight bending at around few PeV, known
as the ﬁrst knee, another at approximately 0.5 EeV known as the second knee,
and a dip extending from roughly the second knee up to beyond 10 EeV,
known as the ankle (see ﬁgure 1). Note that in the right panel the spectrum
is multiplied by E3, a usual trick to highlight features that otherwise would
be almost completely hidden by the rapidly falling ﬂux.

uniform power law with [right] few bends knee (few PeV), second knee (0.5 EeV),
ankle (EeV to few tens of EeV) and the still poorly known highest energy tail.
Adapted from [1].
The second knee has been observed in the vicinity of 4×1017 eV by Akeno
[2], Fly’s Eye stereo [5, 6, 7], Yakutsk [3, 4] and HiRes [10]. The physical
interpretation of this spectral feature is uncertain at present. It may be either
the end of the Galactic cosmic ray component or the pile-up from pair creation
processes due to proton interactions with the cosmic microwave background
radiation during propagation in the intergalactic medium.
The ankle, on the other hand, is a broader feature that has been observed
by Fly’s Eye [5, 6, 7] around 3 × 1018 eV as well as by Haverah Park [8] at
approximately the same energy. These results have been conﬁrmed by Yakutsk
[3, 4] and HiRes [10]. AGASA also observed the ankle, but they locate it at a
higher energy, around 1019 eV [9]. As with the ankle, more than one physical
interpretations are possible, which are intimately related with the nature of the
second knee. The ankle may be the transition point between the Galactic and
extragalactic components, the result of pair creation by protons in the cosmic
microwave background, or the result of diﬀusive propagation of extragalactic
nuclei through cosmic magnetic ﬁelds.
Composition
Certainly, one of the scientiﬁcally most relevant pieces of information inside
the transition energy interval previously deﬁned, is the precise chemical com-
position of the primary CR ﬂux as a function of energy.
Several techniques have been used to determine the composition of cos-
mic rays along the spectrum and, in particular, in the highest energy region
[12]: (i) depth of maximum of the longitudinal distribution, Xmax [13, 14];
(ii) ﬂuctuations of Xmax [15, 16]; (iii) muon density [17]; (iv) steepness of the

lateral distribution function [25, 26]; (v) time proﬁle of the signal, in particu-
lar rise time of the signal [27]; (vi) curvature radius of the shower front; (vii)
multi-parametric analysis, such as principal component analysis and neural
networks [28], etc... Unfortunately, as is frequently the case in physics, when-
ever several techniques are applied to measure the same physical magnitude,
correspondingly, several results are obtained and, not always agreeable among
themselves. As will be shown below, this is critical to the understanding of
the astrophysics of ultra high energy cosmic rays.
In order to analyze the astrophysical implications of the composition along
the second knee/ankle energy region, it is more instructive to start from much
lower energies. A signiﬁcant point is the ﬁrst knee. Following KASCADE [20],
a gradual change in composition is observed through the knee, from a lighter
to a heavier composition. The ﬁrst knee is a broad feature which can be
understood as a composition of power law energy spectra with breaks that
are in agreement with a rigidity scaling of the knee position.
Therefore, at energies above few times 1016 eV, the ﬂux is dominated by
iron nuclei. These particles are of Galactic origin and what is being detected
is, very likely, the end of the eﬃciency of supernova remnant shock waves as
accelerators as the Larmor radii or characteristic diﬀusion scale lengths of the
nuclei become comparable to the curvature radius of the remnants, breaking
down the diﬀusive approximation. If there are not more powerful accelerators
in the Galaxy, the Galactic cosmic ray ﬂux continues dominated exclusively
by iron above 1017 eV up to the highest energies produced inside the Milky
Way. It must be noted that, even if the previous results are quantitatively
dependent on the hadronic interaction model used in the data analysis, they
are qualitatively solid and there is considerable degree of consensus on the ex-
istence of a progressive transition in composition through the knee. At higher
energies, the composition has been measured by several experiments in the
past, e.g., Haverah Park, Yakutsk, Fly’s Eye, HiRes-MIA prototype and HiRes
in stereo mode (see ﬁgure 2).
The Xmax data suggest that, above 1016.6 eV, the composition changes
once more progressively from heavy to light. At the lower limit of this energy
interval, the composition is still heavy, i.e., iron dominated, in accordance to
Kascade results. Nevertheless, at energies of 1019 eV, even if still showing
signs of a contamination by heavy elements, it is more consistent with a ﬂux
dominated by lighter elements.
Despite the fact that there is a consensus among most of the experiments
about the reality of this smooth transition, there is no consensus about the
rate and extent to which the transition occurs. In fact, the combined data
from the HiRes-MIA prototype and HiRes in stereo mode, signal to a much
more rapid transition from heavy to light composition (see ﬁgure 3), starting
1017 eV but which would be over by 1018 eV [29]. Beyond that point, the
composition would remain light and constant.
The later scenario, however, is not supported by the data of other experi-
ments. Haverah Park, for example, shows a predominantly heavy composition

up to 1018 eV, followed by an abrupt transition to lighter values compat-
ible with HiRes stereo at around 1018 eV (see ﬁgure 4a). Volcano Ranch,
even though there is a single experimental point, is compatible with a heavy
composition still at 1018 eV, somewhat in accordance to Haverah Park data.
Akeno (A1), on the other hand, is consistent with a continuation of the grad-
ual transition from the second knee all across the ankle up to at least 1019 eV,
only reaching there the same light composition that HiRes stereo claims from
an order of magnitude below in energy. It must also be noted that above 1019
eV AGASA is only able to set upper limits for the fraction of iron, but these
limits are high enough to leave room for much more complex astrophysical
scenarios with a substantial added mixture of extragalactic ultra-high energy
heavy elements [30].
Figure 4b shows a compendium of several of the available measurements
of composition between ∼1017 and ∼1019 eV, with their corresponding error
bars, under the simplistic assumption of a binary mixture of protons and

iron nuclei. The emerging picture is one complete uncertainty, which has deep
practical implications and imposes severe limitations to theoretical eﬀorts.
At energies beyond ∼10 EeV the composition is essentially unknown.
However, it seems compatible with hadrons even if some photon contribution
cannot be discarded [31, 32, 33] (see ﬁgure 5). Although it is implicitly re-
garded as purely protonic in many theoretical works, only upper limit exists
for the iron fraction (e.g. ﬁgure 4b) and therefore not much can be said until
more accurate measurements are made available by new generation experi-
ments like Auger and TA.
3 Galactic Propagation
The fundamental question of cosmic ray physics is, “Where do they come
from?” and in particular, “How are they accelerated to such high energies?”.
These are diﬃcult questions not fully answered after almost a century of his-
tory of the ﬁeld. Some very general hints can be obtained, however, through

region encompassing the second knee and the ankle: literally almost any abundance

very simple arguments. The interstellar and intergalactic mediae are magne-
tized and, being charged, the CR are forced to interact with these ﬁelds.
From the point of view of propagation of charged particles, the Galaxy
behaves as a magnetized volume, where the ﬁeld is structured on scales of
kpc, with typical intensities of the order of some few micro Gauss. The Larmor
radius of a nucleus of charge Ze can be conveniently parameterized as:
rL,kpc ≈1
Z ×
EEeV
BµG

(1)

Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays: From GeV to ZeV
171
where EEeV is the energy of the particle in units of 1018 eV and rL,kpc is
expressed in kpc.
Equation (1) clearly shows that, given the typical intensity of the mag-
netic ﬁelds present in the interstellar medium (ISM), nuclei with energies
below some few tens of EeV, regardless of their charge, have Larmor radii
much smaller than the transversal dimensions of the magnetized Galactic
disk. They must, therefore, propagate diﬀusively inside the ISM. This trans-
forms the Galaxy in an eﬃcient conﬁnement region for charged particles with
energies below the second knee. The conﬁnement region is a ﬂattened disk of
approximately 20 kpc of radius and thickness of a few hundreds of pc.
Consequently, from the lowest energies and up to the second knee, the
Galaxy is undoubtedly the source of the cosmic ray particles and of their
kinetic energy. There is not a consensus about the actual source of the par-
ticles in itself, but the two main lines of thought propose either nuclei pre-
accelerated at the chromospheres of normal F and G type stars or ambient
electrically charged nuclei condensed in the dense winds of blue or red giant
stars [37, 38]. On the other hand, several acceleration mechanism must be at
play but it is widely expected that the dominant one is ﬁrst order Fermi accel-
eration at the vicinity of supernova remnant shock waves. Nevertheless, the-
oretically, the Galactic accelerators should become ineﬃcient between ∼1017
to ∼1018 eV. This upper limit could be extended to ∼1019 eV if additional
mechanisms were operating in the Galaxy, e.g., spinning inductors associated
with compact objects or cataclysmic events like acceleration of iron nuclei by
young strongly magnetized neutron stars through relativistic MHD winds [39].
At energies above the second knee, particles start to be able to travel from
the nearest extragalactic sources in less than a Hubble time. Consequently,
at some point above 1017.5 eV a sizable cosmic ray extragalactic component
should be detectable and become dominant above 1019 eV. Therefore, it is
expected that the cosmic ray ﬂux detected between the second knee and the
ankle of the spectrum be a mixture of a Galactic and an extragalactic ﬂux,
highlighting the astrophysical richness and complexity of the region.
The type of propagation strongly depends on the charge of the correspond-
ing nucleus. Protons with energies ∼> 1017 eV have gyroradii comparable or
larger than the transversal dimensions of the eﬀective conﬁnement region and,
therefore, can easily escape from the Galaxy. On the other end of the mass
spectrum, just the opposite occurs for iron nuclei that, even at energies of the
order of 1019 eV, have gyroradii < 102 pc and must be eﬀectively conﬁned
inside the magnetized ISM.
The previous results are based only on the consideration of the regular
component of the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld. However, there exist a superimposed
turbulent component whose intensity is at least comparable to that of the
regular ﬁeld. Its spectrum seems to be of the Kolmogorov type, extending
from the smallest scales probed, ∼100 pc, to Lc ∼100 pc, the correlation
length of the turbulent ﬁeld.

Wave-particle interactions between cosmic rays and MHD turbulence are
resonant for wavelengths of the order of the Larmor radius, λ ∼rL. This
means that, for a nucleus of charge Z, a critical energy can be deﬁned,

Lc ≈102pc ⇒Ec,EeV ≈0.5 × Z ,
(2)
below which modes resonant with the particle gyroradius able to eﬃciently
scatter the particle in pitch angle exist. Consequently, at energies below Ec the
diﬀusion coeﬃcient is small enough for the particle trajectory to be diﬀusive.
Above Ec, on the other hand, the propagation is essentially ballistic.
Due to the interaction with the turbulent magnetic component, protons
experience a propagation regime very diﬀerent than iron inside the ankle en-
ergy region. Protons propagate ballistically in the ISM above ∼3 × 1017 eV,
while iron nuclei propagate diﬀusively even at energies ∼> 1019 eV. Therefore,
along the energy region extending from the second knee up to almost the end
of the ankle, all nuclei from p to Fe, i.e. 1 < Z < 26, experience a transition
in their propagation regime inside the ISM changing gradually from diﬀusive
to ballistic as the energy increases.
A pictorial example of how this transition takes place can be seen in ﬁg-
ure 6a-d [40], which shown how protons with energies ranging from 0.5 to 6
EeV injected at the Galactic center propagate out of the Galaxy assuming a
characteristic BSSS magnetic model. It must be noted that, despite the fact
that the deﬂections induced by the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld (GMF) diminish
rapidly with energy for all nuclei, they can still be important even at the
highest energies. This is more critical for heavier primaries and for all nuclei
traversing the central regions of the Galaxy. Figure 7 illustrates this point by
showing the intrinsic deﬂections experienced by proton and iron nuclei as a
function of arrival Galactic coordinates [41].
Figure 8 shows deﬂections for 100 EeV protons for a more sophisticated
GMF model inspired on Han’s proposal [11]. The GMF is modelled by a disk
BSSS component of 100 pc half thickness, embedded in an ASSA halo and a
dipolar component originated in a Southward magnetic momentum anchored
at the Galactic center.
4 Extragalactic Propagation
4.1 Superposition of the Extragalactic and Galactic ﬂuxes
In the same way as the magnetic characteristic of the interstellar medium allow
Galactic particles at these energies to escape into the extragalactic environ-
ment, extragalactic cosmic rays are also able to penetrate inside the Galactic
conﬁnement region. But, of course, extragalactic particles must ﬁrst be able
to reach us from the nearest Galaxies in less than a Hubble time.

A crude approximation to this eﬀect can be made in the following way.

Equation (7) shows that there is a rather restrictive magnetic horizon. Basi-
cally, no nucleus with energy smaller than 1017 eV is able to arrive from regions
external to the local group (D ∼3 Mpc). Taking as a minimum character-
istic distance D = 10 Mpc, which deﬁnes a very localized region completely
internal to the supergalactic plane and even smaller than the distance to the
nearby Virgo cluster, only protons with E > 2 × 1017 eV, or Fe nuclei with
E > 5 × 1018 eV are able to reach the Galaxy in less than a Hubble time.
Therefore, it is at the energies of the second knee and the ankle that
diﬀerent nuclei start to arrive from the local universe. Concomitantly, at these
same energies the magnetic shielding of the Galaxy becomes permeable to
these nuclei, allowing them to enter the ISM and to eventually reach the solar
system. Eﬀectively, the energy interval from ∼2×1017 to 1019 eV is the region
of mixing between the Galactic and extragalactic components of cosmic rays.
Above few times 1017 eV, the dominant interactions experienced by cosmic
rays are due to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) and,
additionally in the case of nuclei, to the infrared background (CIBR) [43].
The diﬀuse radio background, despite its much lower density, must in turn
become important at high enough energies.
At energies above ∼1019.2 eV, the dominant process is the photo produc-
tion of pions in interactions with the CMBR (see ﬁgure 9a), which drastically

reduces the mean free path of protons to a few Mpc, making the universe op-
tically thick to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (ﬁgure 9b). This interaction,
in the most conservative models, should produce a strong depression in the
energy spectrum, with a major fall in the observed ﬂux above 1020 eV, the so
called GZK cut-oﬀ[45, 46].
At energies smaller than ∼1019.2 eV, the dominant process is the photo-
production of electron-positron pairs in interactions with the CMBR. At these
lower energies the attenuation length attain values of the order of Gpc and the
universe is essentially optically thin to energetic baryons. CR observations at
these energies sample the universe at cosmological distances, contrary to the
highest energies, that only sample a sphere of a few tens of Mpc in diameter,
a small portion of the local universe [49, 50, 51]. Therefore, strictly from the
point of view of propagation in the extragalactic medium, in going down from
the highest energies to the transition region, the observable horizon drastically
increases from 101 to 103 Mpc, i.e., essentially the whole universe.
It can also be seen from ﬁgure 9a that the dependence of the cross section
with energy is suggestive, since its shape resembles that of the ankle in the
cosmic ray energy spectrum. In fact, the structure of the ankle can be ex-
plained exclusively as a result of pair photo-production by nucleons traveling
cosmological distances between the source and the observer [47].
The energy region where the superposition of the Galactic and extragalac-
tic spectra takes place is a theoretically challenging region, where the smooth

From the theoretical point of view, the transition region is highly complex and the

matching of the two rapidly varying spectra has yet to be explained. It must
be noted that, even if the shape of the spectrum is important, it is by far insuf-
ﬁcient to decipher the underlying astrophysical model. The Galactic magnetic
ﬁelds are intense enough to dilute any directional information, which prevents
the discrimination among the galactic and extragalactic components from the
arrival direction of the incoming particles. The variation of the composition
as a function of energy turns then into the key to discriminate both ﬂuxes
and to select among a variety of theoretical options.
As in the case of the ISM, it is expected that the intergalactic medium has
a strong magnetic turbulent component which can severely aﬀect propagation
[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]. The correlation length estimated from Faraday rotation
measurements, Lc, is consistent with a maximum wavelength for the MHD
turbulence determined by the largest kinetic energy injection scales in the
intergalactic medium, Lmax ∼Lc ∼1 Mpc. In analogy to equation (2):

For a given nucleus of charge Ze, the propagation is ballistic for E > Ec being
diﬀusive otherwise. Therefore, protons are ballistic above ∼1018 eV, but dif-
fusive at the energies of the second knee. Iron nuclei, on the other hand, propa-
gate diﬀusively along the ankle and even at energies as high as ∼5 × 1019 eV.
The boundaries for the transition between the ballistic and diﬀusive propaga-
tion regime for proton and Fe nuclei are shown in the ﬁgure 11. Furthermore,
besides the total intensity and the minimum wavenumber, also the energy

distribution among the diﬀerent modes, that is the type of turbulence present
in the intergalactic medium, has observational expression. In this case, the af-
fected portion of the extragalactic spectrum is the lower energy region, where
the ﬂux is strongly suppressed by magnetic horizon eﬀects. Figure 11 shows
clearly this eﬀect for three diﬀerent assumptions for the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.
Obviously, this has profound theoretical implications not only for the struc-
ture of the extragalactic magnetized medium, but also for cosmic ray accel-
eration conditions inside the Galaxy. This is exempliﬁed in ﬁgure 12 where it
is graphically illustrated that, by subtracting a given extragalactic spectrum
from the observed total spectrum, conclusions can be drawn about relevant
aspects of the Galactic component. For example, an extragalactic spectrum
that has a small contribution at low energies, can imply the existence of ad-
ditional acceleration mechanisms in the Galaxy other than the shock waves
of supernova remnants.
4.2 The Highest Energies
Propagation of Protons
As was mentioned in the previous section 4.1 (see ﬁgure 9), above the threshold
for photo-pion production by protons interacting with the CMBR, ∼40 EeV

the universe becomes rapidly opaque for hadrons as the attenuation length
goes down to values as low as ∼10 Mpc at few ×1020 eV. This determines
a relatively small maximum distance scale, RGZK ⋍50 −100 Mpc, to the
sources that are able to contribute appreciably to the detected CR ﬂux.
Under very general assumptions regarding the nature of the primaries and
the cosmological distribution of the sources, photo-pion production should
lead to the formation of a pile-up immediately followed by a severe reduction
in CR ﬂux, popularly known as the GZK cut-oﬀ. The existence of this spectral
feature was proposed short time after the discovery of the CMBR [45, 46] but
its actual existence is still a matter of considerable debate.
At present, there are conﬂicting measurements coming from two diﬀerent
experiments: AGASA and HiRes. The ﬁrst one is a surface detector while
the second one is a ﬂuorescence detector, which further complicates the com-
parison of their results. As shown in ﬁgure 13, the diﬀerences are not only
quantitative but, fundamentally, qualitative. While HiRes apparently shows
the expected GZK ﬂux suppression, AGASA seems incompatible with this
result, showing an energy spectrum that extends undisturbed well beyond
100 EeV. There is also an apparently large diﬀerence in ﬂux between both

from [60]).
experiments at energies below the cut-oﬀ. However, the fact that the energy
spectrum has been multiplied by E3 in ﬁgure 13 should be taken into account
when assessing the signiﬁcance of such diﬀerence.
Actually, both results may be reconciled at the 1.5 σ level by re-scaling
the energy of the experiments by 30% or both by 15% [61]. The Auger Obser-
vatory, being the largest detector ever built and having hybrid capacity i.e.,
simultaneous ﬂuorescence and surface detection [62], has the potential -but not
yet the statistics- to give a deﬁnite answer to this fundamental problem [63].
The absence of the GZK cut-oﬀ, if conﬁrmed, could be compatible with
a wide range of astrophysical scenarios. At least three possibilities can be
considered, some rather conservative, some more exotic:
•
The distance scale between sources could be large enough that, by chance,
the few (or single) sources inside the GZK sphere dominate the ﬂux, the
rest of the population of ultra high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) acceler-
ators being too distant to contribute appreciably to the observed ﬂux at
Earth.
•
The primary CR might be particles that do not interact with photons
or do so at much larger, and as yet unobserved, energies. These could
be familiar standard model particles that present unexpected behavior at
ultra-high energies, like neutrinos with hadronic cross section that can de-
velop showers in the atmosphere resembling those expected from proton
primaries [64, 65]. Another possibility could be a new stable hadron, heav-

181
ier than a nucleon, for which the threshold for photo-meson production
would be at higher energy. An example of the latter would be uhecrons,
e.g., a uds-gluino bound state [66].
•
The primaries might be normal hadrons, but Lorentz invariance, never
previously tested at γ ∼1011, could be violated at ultra-high energies,
hampering photo-meson production [67, 68, 69]. The small violation of
Lorentz invariance required might be result of Planck scale eﬀects [70, 71].
•
The observed spectrum could be the superposition of two components: (a)
a hadronic component with a GZK cut-oﬀand (b) a harder, top-down
component that becomes dominant above ∼100 EeV. These second com-
ponent could be originated in the decay or annihilation of super heavy
dark matter or topological defects [72, 73, 74, 76]. These scenarios have
the general disadvantage of overproducing ultra-high energy neutrinos and
photons rather than nucleons, which seems to be increasingly constrained
by the observation [33, 81]. Nevertheless, there could still be models, like
those involving necklaces, that could present an appreciable baryon con-
tent at energies ∼> 100 EeV [75]. In any case, these models suﬀer from a
discomforting level of ﬁne tuning with respect to the normalization of the
intensities of the GZKed and the top-down spectra.
It must also be noted that the presence of the GZK ﬂux suppression does not
imply the non-existence of supra-GZK particles. These have certainly been
detected by at least Volcano Ranch [77, 78], Fly’s Eye [79], AGASA, HiRes
and, more recently, Auger [80]. This means that, the detection of the GZK
feature does not solve the puzzle about the generation of UHECR.
Propagation of UHE Photons
The propagation of photons is dominated by their interaction with the photon
background. The main processes are photon absorption by pair-production on
background photons (γγb →e+e−), and inverse Compton scattering of the
resultant electrons on the background photons. These two processes acting in a
chain are responsible for the rapid development of electromagnetic cascades in
the intergalactic or interstellar media, draining energy to the sub-TeV region.
For a given UHE photon of energy Eγ, the minimum background photon
energy, Eb, for electron-positron pair production is
Eb = m2

and the corresponding cross section peaks near the threshold: σP P ∝(m2
e/s)∗
ln(s/2me) (see Carrami˜nana, in this volume). Inverse Compton scattering, on
the other hand, has no threshold but its cross section is also largest near the
γγb pair production threshold. Therefore, the most eﬃcient background for
both processes is given by equation (9). For UHE this means that the cosmic
radio background, whose magnitude is highly uncertain, is dominant followed

182
Gustavo Medina Tanco
by the CMBR below 1017 – 1018 eV. At progressively lower energies, the CIRB
and optical background are important.
In the Klein-Nishina limit, s ≫m2
e, one of the components of the γγb-
produced pair carries most of the energy of the energy of the UHE photon.
This leading particle, afterwards, undergoes Compton scattering in the same
limit, for which the inelasticity is very near 1. Therefore, the Compton up-
scattered photon still has an appreciable fraction of the energy of the original
UHE photon. The presence of magnetic ﬁelds in the medium may speed up the
development of the cascade by draining the electron and positron energy due
to synchrotron radiation. The larger the ﬁelds, the smaller the penetration.
The electromagnetic cascades produced in this way can propagate an eﬀective
distance that is much larger than the interaction length yet, severely limit our
UHE-γ horizon to the nearest regions of the supergalactic plane. Figure 14
[72] shows the eﬀective penetration length of electromagnetic cascades for two
diﬀerent estimates of the cosmic radio background and two diﬀerent average
intergalactic magnetic ﬁeld intensities.
Since the single pair cross section decreases as ln(s)/s for s ≫m2
e, multi-
ple pair production becomes important at extreme energies. Thus, double pair
production (γγb →e+e−e+e−) begins to dominate above ∼1021 – 1023 eV.
The relevant process for electrons is triple pair production (e±γb →e±e−e+),
whose attenuation becomes dominant at ∼1022 eV. Other processes (e.g.,
moun, tau or pion pair production, double Compton scattering, gamma scat-
tering and pair production of single photons in magnetic ﬁelds) are in general
negligible for electromagnetic cascade development. However, at energies in
excess of 1024 eV, the pair production of single photons in the Galactic mag-
netic ﬁeld should eliminate all the photons above that energy from speciﬁc
lines of sight, generating an arrival direction anisotropy.
The penetration lengths shown in ﬁgure 14, combined with the threshold
energies given by equation (9), imply that the injection of UHE-γ in the in-
tergalactic medium results in the pile-up of photons at energies below 100
MeV, whose contribution to the diﬀuse cosmic γ background is already obser-
vationally constrained by EGRET. This overproduction of low energy diﬀuse
photons is a strong restriction for top-down UHECR production models.
Besides the limitations imposed by the possible overproduction of low en-
ergy photons, the results in ﬁgure 14 have other profound implications for
top-down scenarios. Models that claim decay or annihilation of dark matter,
in general, tend to produce mainly photons and only a few percent baryons.
Therefore, in such models, most of the detected CR should be photons from
our own Galactic halo, with perhaps some localized contribution from An-
dromeda. The products of the decay of more distant dark matter would be
cleared from photons, and only the small fraction of remaining baryons, sup-
pressed by GZK eﬀects, would give a positive contribution at Earth. In any
case, for most top-down models, photons should be dominant above the GZK
cut-oﬀ, but with perhaps a sizable baryonic component.

Propagation of Nuclei
Heavy nuclei are attenuated by two basic processes: photodisintegration and
electron-positron pair creation by interaction with background photons. For a
given total energy, the threshold photo-pion production for a nucleus of mass
A increases to Eth ≃4 × 1019 × A. Therefore, given the energies observed at
present, pion production is not relevant for nuclei heavier than He. Figure 15
shows that below ∼20 EeV, all nuclei are able to travel for virtually a Hubble
time, while Fe can do the same up to ∼100 EeV. Above that energy, nuclei
start to disintegrate fast and the loss time is highly reduced.
It is clear from composition observations around the ﬁrst knee of the cosmic
rays spectrum that the acceleration mechanism by shock waves, either ﬁrst
order Fermi or drift are limited by the magnitude of the radius of curvature
of the shock. This results in the preferential acceleration of large charge (Ze)
nuclei, those with the smallest Larmor radius, to the highest energies.
Even if the mechanism responsible for the acceleration of the ultra-high
energy extragalactic component is essentially unknown, the most conservative
view points to bottom-up mechanisms. If the later is actually the case, then
the most economic assumption is that shock wave acceleration. In this mini-
malistic, but still realistic, scenario the most likely high energy output would
be heavy nuclei, very likely Fe as in the Galactic case. At lower energies,

progressively lighter nuclei should be observed due to two factors: (a) the ac-
celeration process in itself and (b) the photo-disintegration on ﬂight of the
heavier nuclei due to their interaction with the CIBR. The latter process is
very eﬃcient, and can extract approximately one nucleon every few Mpc at
the highest energies, depending on the CIBR level. Since photodisintegration
occurs, to a good approximation, at constant energy per nucleon, disintegra-
tion of a nucleus A at energy E will produce light nuclei at energies nE/A
and (A −n)E/A with preferentially small n (e.g., n = 1, 2, 3, 4).
Figure 16 shows that power law spectra injected at cosmological sources
with diﬀerent compositions can produce experimentally very similar at the
highest energies. Nevertheless, they can always be distinguished at smaller
energies in the ankle region. In particular, ﬁgure 16a show a purely protonic
ﬂux can reproduce the ankle feature solely as an eﬀect of photo production
of electron-positron pairs in interactions with the CMBR. In this case, the
transition between the Galactic and extragalactic ﬂuxes must be located at
the second knee or very near to it. Figure 16b shows that, on the other hand,
for a heavier mixed composition the extragalactic spectrum falls down steadily
with decreasing energy. In this scenario, the ankle must be the result of the
composition between the Galactic and extragalactic spectra. Moreover, the
composition will be a strong function of energy inside this interval, giving an
additional tool to assess details of the astrophysical model.
The eﬀects of photo-disintegration are clearly shown in ﬁgure 17, depicting
the evolution of a pure iron injected spectrum as it propagates out from the
source. Blue histograms correspond to p, white to the original surviving Fe

and red to intermediate mass nuclei. As the distance to the source increases,
intermediate nuclei are produced at increasingly smaller masses and less total
energy (fragmentation takes place at roughly constant mass per nucleon). At
distances of the order of the GZK horizon, the region with larger mixing of
nuclei, i.e., with a larger composition gradient, is the ankle. Consequently,
this is the ideal region for the discrimination of the primary composition from
local composition measurements.
5 Cosmic Magnetic Fields and Anisotropy
Luminous matter, as traced by galaxies, and dark matter, as traced by galaxies
and clusters large scale velocity ﬁelds, are distributed inhomogeneously in
the universe. Groups, clusters, superclusters, walls, ﬁlaments and voids are
known to exist at all observed distances and are very well mapped in the local
universe. Hence, the distribution of matter inside the GZK-sphere is highly
inhomogeneous and so is, very likely, the distribution of UHECR sources.
Synchrotron emission and multi-wavelength radio polarization measure-
ments show that magnetic ﬁelds are widespread in the Universe. But how do
they encompass the structure seen in the distribution of matter we do not
yet know [42]. The available limits on the intergalactic magnetic ﬁeld (IGMF)
come from rotation measure estimates in clusters of galaxies and suggest that
BIGM × L1/2

< 10−9 G × Mpc1/2 [42], where Lc is the ﬁeld reversal scale.
Note, however, that this kind of measurement does not set an actual limit to
the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld unless the reversal scale is known along a

particular line of sight. The latter means that, depending on the structure of
the IGMF, substantially diﬀerent scenarios can be envisioned that are able
satisfy the rotation measure constraints.
Unfortunately, we do not know what is the actual large scale structure of
the IGMF. But we can imagine two extreme scenarios that are likely to bound
the true IGMF structure. In ﬁgure 18 calculations of large scale structure for-
mation by Ryu and co-workers [99] have been modiﬁed by hand to exemplify
these scenarios. The top frame displays Ryu’s IGMF simulation results in the
background showing how by z = 0 the magnetic ﬁeld has been convected to-
gether with the accretion ﬂows into walls, ﬁlaments and clusters, depleting the
voids from ﬁeld. According to these calculations, the magnetic ﬁeld is conﬁned
in high density, small ﬁlling factor regions, bounded by a rather thin skin of
rapidly decreasing intensity, surrounded by large volumes of negligible IGMF.
As suggested by the free-hand lines on top of the ﬁgure, the IGMF inside these
structures is highly correlated in scales of up to tens of Mpc. Furthermore,
in order to comply with the rotation measurement constraints mentioned be-
fore, the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the density structures must be

ture and (bottom) cellular structure. These schematic plots are adaptations by hand

correspondingly high, 0.1–1 µG, which is comparable with values within the
ISM. We will call the latter scenario laminar-structure.
The second model, that we will call cellular-structure, is depicted in the
bottom panel of ﬁgure 18. We imagine the space divided into adjacent cells,
each one with an uniform magnetic ﬁeld randomly oriented. We identify the
size of a cell with the magnitude of the local reversal scale. Furthermore, one
can assume that the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld scales as some power of the
local matter (electron) density and, consequently, the rotation measurement
constraint BIGM×L1/2
c
< 10−9 G × Mpc1/2 tells us how the reversal scale, i.e.,
the size of the cells, should scale. A convenient reference, such as the IGMF
in the Virgo [85] or Coma [89] cluster can be used for normalization. The

cellular-structure scenario leads to a more widespread IGMF, ﬁlling even the
voids. The observational constraints imply then that the IGMF varies much
more smoothly, from 10−10G inside voids to a few times 10−9–10−8G inside
walls and ﬁlaments, only reaching high values, 0.1 −1 µG, inside and around
clusters of galaxies. Observations cannot presently distinguish between these
two scenarios. Nevertheless, we can still try to asses what are their implications
for UHECR propagation which, inspecting ﬁgure 19, must be important.
5.1 UHECR Propagation in a Laminar-IGMF
A laminar-IGMF is the most diﬃcult scenario to dealt with because it does
not accept a statistical treatment and results are very dependent on details
about the exact magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration inside the GZK-sphere, which is
beyond our present knowledge.
A simple approach is to study the UHECR emissivity of a single wall sur-
rounded by a void [94, 93]. Figure 20a shows the corresponding model for a
wall immersed in a void. The magnetic ﬁeld inside the wall has two compo-
nents: an uniform ﬁeld along the z-axis of intensity 0.1µG, plus a random
ﬁeld with a Kolmogoroﬀpower law spectrum of amplitude equal to 30% of
the regular component. One hundred UHECR sources are included inside the
wall, and each one of them injects protons at the same rate and with the
same power low energy spectrum, dNinj/dE ∝E−2. Pair-production and
photo-pion production losses in interactions with the infrared and microwave
backgrounds are also included. The wall has a radius of 20 Mpc, a thickness

of 5 Mpc and is sandwiched by a transition layer 5 Mpc in thickness where
the magnetic ﬁeld decreases exponentially up to negligible values inside the
surrounding void. Once the system reaches steady state, a detector can be
shifted around the wall to simulate observers at arbitrary positions with re-
spect to the wall. In a real situation, this system could be representative, for
example, of the supergalactic plane; in that case the Milky Way, i.e. we, the
observers, should be located at some point on the x −z plane (but we do not
know at what angle with respect to the z-axis). The simulations show that
the UHECR ﬂux measured can vary by three orders of magnitude depending
on the relative orientation between the wall, the ﬁeld and the observer. At the
same time, almost all directional information is lost, and the strength of the
GZK-cut-oﬀwould vary considerably as a function of orientation [93].
The previous eﬀects can be intuitively understood by looking at ﬁgure 20b,
showing a cross section at z = 0 of the wall in ﬁgure 20a. Particle trajectories
are shown for protons injected at E = 100 EeV, with diﬀerent azimuthal angles
and a slight elevation with respect to the x−y plane. It can be seen that there
is nothing like a random walk: particles tend to be trapped inside the wall
and move in a systematic way. Most of the particles drift perpendicularly to
the regular ﬁeld while their guiding centers bounce along the ﬁeld. It can also
be seen how the gyroradii decrease as the particles lose energy in interactions
with the radiation backgrounds. Even the few particles that escape from the
wall, do so in a anisotropic manner (e.g., predominantly to the right for y > 0).
The laminar IGMF model is, actually, the worst scenario for doing some
kind of astronomy with UHECR. It would be very diﬃcult to interpret the
UHECR angular data and to identify individual particle sources. Furthermore,
the signiﬁcance of any statistical analysis would be greatly impaired due to
systematics. Further studies on this model can be found in [103, 104].

5.2 UHECR Propagation in a Cellular-IGMF
The cellular model is the easiest scenario to deal with numerically and, by
far, the most promising from the point of view of the astrophysics of UHECR.
This is also the IGMF model that has been used probably more frequently in
the literature [86, 90, 53, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98].
The main assumption is that the intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld scales with
density. Indeed, for those spatial scales where measurements are available, the
intensity of the magnetic ﬁelds seem to correlate remarkably well with the
density of thermal gas in the medium. This is valid at least at galactic and
smaller scales [100, 96]. It is apparent that B can be reasonably well ﬁtted
by a single power law over ∼14 orders of magnitude in thermal gas density
at sub-galactic scales. A power law correlation, though with a diﬀerent power
law index, is also suggested at very large scales (c.f. ﬁgure 5 in [96]), from
galactic halos to the environments outside galaxy clusters, over ∼4 orders of
magnitude in thermal gas density. This view [100] is, however, still controver-
sial [42]. In fact, magnetic ﬁelds in galaxy clusters are roughly ∼1 µG, of the
same order as interstellar magnetic ﬁelds; furthermore, supracluster emission
around the Coma cluster suggests µG ﬁelds in extended regions beyond cluster
cores. The latter could indicate that the IGMF cares little about the density
of the associated thermal gas density, having everywhere an intensity close to
the microwave background-equivalent magnetic ﬁeld, BBGE ≃3 × 10−6 G.
Taking the view that a power law scaling exists, a model can be devised
in which the IGMF correlates with the distribution of matter as traced, for
example, by the distribution of galaxies. A high degree of non-homogeneity
should then be expected, with relatively high values of BIGMF over small
regions ( <
∼1 Mpc) of high matter density. These systems should be immersed
in vast low density/low BIGMF regions, with BIGMF < 10−9 G. Furthermore,
in accordance with rotation measures, the topology of the ﬁeld should be
structured coherently on scales of the order of the correlation length Lc which,
in turn, scales with IGMF intensity, Lc ∝B−2
IGMF (r). BIGMF should be
independently oriented at distances > Lc. Therefore, a 3D ensemble of cells
can be constructed, with cell size given by the correlation length, Lc, and such
that Lc ∝B−2
IGMF (r), while BIGMF ∝ρ0.35
gal (r) [100] or ∝ρ2/3
gal (r) (for frozen-in
ﬁeld compression), where ρgal is the galaxy density, and the IGMF is uniform
inside cells of size Lc and randomly oriented with respect to adjacent cells
[91, 98]. The observed IGMF value at some given point, like the Virgo cluster,
can be used as the normalization condition for the magnetic ﬁeld intensity.
The density of galaxies, ρgal, is estimated using either redshift catalogs (like
the CfA Redshift Catalogue [92, 95] or the PSCz [88]), or large scale structure
formation simulations [98]. This is a convenient way to cope with, or at least
to assess, the importance of the several biases involved in the use of galaxy
redshift surveys to sample the true spatial distribution of matter in 3D space.
The spatial distribution of the UHECR sources is tightly linked to the nature
of the main particle acceleration/production mechanism involved. However, in

most models, particles will either be accelerated at astrophysical sites that are
related to baryonic matter, or produced via decay of dark matter particles.
In both cases the distribution of galaxies (luminous matter) should be an
acceptable, if certainly not optimal, tracer of the sources.
The relevant energy losses for UHECR during propagation are γ −γ pair
production with CMB for photons, redshift, pair production and photopion
production in interactions with the CMB for nuclei and, for heavy nuclei, also
photo-disintegration in interactions with the infrared background. All of these
can be appropriately included [87, 101, 102, 72].
Once the previously described scenario is built, test particles can be
injected at the sources and propagated through the intergalactic medium
and intervening IGMF to the detector at Earth. Figure 21a-b show the ar-
rival probability distribution of UHECR protons in Galactic coordinates for
a distribution of sources following the distribution of luminous matter in-

side 100 Mpc (CfA2 catalog). A power law injection energy spectrum at the
sources is assumed, dNinj/dE ∝E−2, with (a) Einj > 4 × 1019 eV and (b)
Einj > 1020 eV respectively. It can be seen that, in contrast to the laminar
IGMF case, in this scenario information regarding the large scale distribu-
tion of the sources inside the GZK-sphere is easily recoverable. The super-
galactic plane and the Virgo cluster, in particular, are clearly visible between
ℓ≃0 −100. The increase in resolution as the energy reaches the 100 EeV
range and the gyroradii of UHECR protons become comparable to the size
of the GZK-sphere can also be appreciated. It is in the cellular model that
the deﬂection angle of the incoming particle with respect to the true angular
position of the source is small enough for UHECR astronomy to develop at
the largest energies (ﬁgure 22).
5.3 Anisotropy Observations and Magnetic Fields
CR anisotropies can be divided, in principle, according to the angular scales
they aﬀect at a given energy region: (a) large scales, extending across several
tens of degrees in the sky, (b) medium scales, <
∼10◦and (c) small scales, of the

Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Rays: From GeV to ZeV

order of the angular resolution of the experiment, i.e, ∼1−3◦. At all energies
CR are remarkably isotropic. At energies below ∼100 TeV, a ﬁrst harmonic
analysis shows an anisotropy amounting to less than 0.07%. At large energies,
on the other hand, measurements are increasingly diﬃcult due to lowering
statistics and ambiguities in the interpretation of the data due to the non-
uniformity of the detectors’ acceptance [105, 106]. Nevertheless, all the data
available are consistent with large scale isotropy [107, 108, 109, 80]. In fact,
besides the AGASA experiment, neither HiRes or Auger have been able so
far of detecting anisotropy at any energy or angular scale [109, 80, 110].
At energies around 1 EeV, i.e., the beginning of the ankle where there
should still be a sizable Galactic contribution to the ﬂux, Fly’s Eye has en-
countered a statistically signiﬁcant correlation with the Galactic plane in the
energy range between 0.2 and 3.2 EeV [111]. They assessed the probability
of this result being a statistical ﬂuctuation of an isotropic distribution at
< 0.06%. The most signiﬁcant enhancement is in the interval 0.4–1.0 EeV.
AGASA, on the other hand has reported a > 4σ excess towards the direction
of the Galactic center [112]. The excess was conﬁrmed in two independent data
sets with 18274 and 10933 events in the 1–2 EeV region, with chance proba-
bilities of 0.3 and 0.5% respectively. The 4.5σ eﬀect observed corresponds to
506 events detected in a region of the sky where only 413.6 were expected.
Associated with this enhancement was a probably dipolar signal towards the
inner regions of the Galaxy of amplitude 0.04 [113]. An independent conﬁr-
mation of an anisotropy possibly related to this one comes from the SUGAR
experiment [114] which, diﬀerent from AGASA, was able to look directly at
the Galactic center. Unfortunately, these ﬁndings have not been conﬁrmed so
far by either HiRes or Auger [115].
At small scales, < 2.5◦, comparable with the resolution of the experiment,
AGASA has reported the existence of pairs and triplets of events, which have
grown in number over the years to a total of 7 pairs and 1 triplet (or 9 pairs
if the triplets is counted as 2 pairs) above 40 EeV [119, 120, 121, 122]. Since,
following AGASA estimations, a total of 1.7 pairs was expected at this sepa-
ration, the results has a chance probability of less than 0.1%. This result has
not been conﬁrmed by HiRes in the combined AGASA-HiRes data set [123],
but still remains a topic of hot debate due to its enormous astrophysical signif-
icance. It must also be noted that it is diﬃcult to understand simultaneously
the existence of at least the three original pairs when the actual distribution
of matter inside the GZK sphere is taken into account [92].
Finally, another very promising anisotropic signal coming from the AGASA
experiment is found as an alignment in the relative orientation of pairs of in-
coming events above 10 EeV in the ∆ℓ−∆b plane (Galactic coordinates)
on scales of
<
∼10◦[116, 117]. It must be noted that this anisotropy is funda-
mentally diﬀerent from a simple clustering of events in a given angular scale,
since it is limited to an aligned structure in the two point correlation function.
This signal can only be produced as the result of charged CR bending their
trajectories in the Galactic magnetic ﬁeld. The astrophysical implications of
this observation have been analyzed in detail in [118]. CR polarization, if con-

194

ﬁrmed, could turn into a powerful tool for the determination of the number
of nearby CR point sources and for imposing constraints on the intensity and
topology of the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic ﬁelds.
Summing up the results on anisotropy at the highest energies so far, and
remembering our discussion about the eﬀects of diﬀerent spacial structures
and intensities of the IGMF (sections 5.1 and 5.2), the high degree of isotropy
observed by most experiments, seems to favor a laminar IGMF structure.
However, it must be remembered that local coherent magnetized structures,
as our own halo may be, could de-focus particles coming from point sources
into an apparently isotropic ﬂux further complicating the analysis [124, 125].

Radio astronomy was the second electromagnetic window used to study the
Universe and its development opened the door to the multiwavelength as-
tronomy that characterizes much of the present day research. I brieﬂy review
the early story and achievements of radio astronomy. I also present recent
astronomical discoveries obtained at radio wavelengths, as well as the char-
acteristics and key science drivers of the next generation of radio telescopes,
now under construction or design in various countries. I will also discuss the
situation of this area of astronomical research in Mexico and the possibilities
for the future.
1 Introduction
Radio astronomy is the science that studies the Universe in electromagnetic
radiation with wavelengths between approximately 20 meters and 0.3 millime-
ters. Radio astronomy then covers a range of about 104 in the size of the waves
studied (as opposed to a factor of only 2 in the visible waves). This has an im-
mediate consequence: since it is impossible in practice to build an instrument
that will detect eﬃciently waves that are so diﬀerent in size, it is necessary
to have diﬀerent radio telescopes to cover the whole of the radio window. In
what respects to the atmospheric transparency, at the long wavelengths the
limit is set by the ionosphere, that reﬂects radiation of longer wavelengths
coming into the earth’s surface (or going out). At the short wavelengths the
limit is set by absorption in the the troposphere by molecules like H2O (water
vapor) and O2 (molecular hydrogen).
The ﬁrst detection of extraterrestrial radio waves was made by Karl Jan-
sky in 1931. Jansky was a physicist working for the famous Bell Labs, with
the assignment of identifying the sources of static that might interfere with
radio voice transmissions. He built an antenna, shown in Figure 1, designed
to receive radio waves at a frequency of 20.5 MHz (a wavelength of about
14.5 meters). It was mounted on a turntable that allowed it to rotate in any

direction, so that one could ﬁnd the direction of origin in azimuth of the radio
signals. Jansky soon found that most of the static was coming from thunder-
storms, both nearby and distant. But in addition he found a faint steady hiss
of unknown origin. Over the years it became clear that Jansky had detected
emission from the plane of our Galaxy, that emits synchrotron radiation (pro-
duced by relativistic electrons spiraling in the magnetic ﬁelds that exist in
interstellar space). The emission was strongest in the direction of the center
of our Galaxy.
Jansky wanted to investigate the nature of the radio waves from space
and proposed to Bell Labs the building of a 30 meter diameter dish antenna.
However, Jansky was assigned to other projects and did no more research in
radio astronomy, dying in 1950 at the early age of 44 years.

Professional astronomers in the epoch of Jansky did not take seriously the
fact that the Universe could be studied at wavelengths other than those of the
visible light and did not make any serious follow up of his work. Grote Reber,
a ham radio operator, learned about Karl Jansky’s discovery and constructed
in his back yard in Wheaton, Illinois a radio telescope (see Figure 2) to learn
more about cosmic radio waves. He was able to conﬁrm the radiation detected
by Jansky and to show that it was stronger at the longer wavelengths, a key

observational fact to interpret its nature as synchrotron radiation. Reber lived
to be 90, dying in Tasmania in 2002.
Radio astronomy became institutional only after the Second World War,
when the developments in radar technology opened the doors to the con-
struction of large radio telescopes in many countries in the world. Since radio
astronomy started working ﬁrst in the long wavelengths (meter and centime-
ter), where atmospheric weather aﬀects very little the radio observations, this
new ﬁeld was particularly attractive for countries like England or Holland,
where secular poor weather and lack of high elevation sites had diﬃculted
the development of modern optical observatories. Radio astronomy became
an important alternative for these countries. With time, radio astronomical

research included also the short wavelengths (millimeter and submillimeter),
where the atmosphere aﬀects seriously the observations and high and dry
sites, similar to those for optical observatories, are required.
In the beginnings, angular resolution was a serious limitation of radio
astronomy. The angular resolution of a telescope is given by
θ ≃λ
D,
(1)
where θ is the angular resolution in radians, λ is the observed wavelength,
and D is the diameter of the telescope, in the same units that the λ. For a
radio telescope with D = 24 m observing at λ = 21 cm, the angular resolu-
tion is 9 × 10−3 radians or about half a degree, the angular diameter of the
Moon. This is a very poor angular resolution and optical astronomy had been
achieving for decades angular resolutions thousands of times better (about
one arc second). This lack of angular resolution in the early years of radio
astronomy also helped explain the modest interest that the new science pro-
duced in the consolidated community of optical astronomers. Paradoxically,
with time radio astronomy strongly developed interferometry, where at least
two and preferably many radio telescopes observing simultaneously the same
region in the sly are spread over a large region. The angular resolution of an
interferometer is given by
θ ≃λ
B ,
(2)
where now B is the maximum separation (or baseline, as it is usually called)
between the radio telescopes that form the interferometer. B can be kilome-
ters or even thousands of kilometers long and over the years radio astronomy
eventually surpassed all other astronomies in angular resolution. Now inter-
continental interferometers routinely reach angular resolutions of milliarc sec-
onds.
2 The Achievements of Radio Astronomy
Beyond the scientiﬁc contributions that we will review later, the major
achievement of radio astronomy is that it persuaded the astronomical commu-
nity (then mostly optical astronomers) that it was worthwhile to look at the
Universe at other wavelengths. Nowadays, we observe the Universe in all the
windows of the electromagnetic spectrum: radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet,
X rays, and γ rays. Of these waves, only the visible light, part of the infrared,
and the radio waves can be observed from the surface of the earth (see Fig. 3).
The other electromagnetic windows had to wait for the development of space
technology to blossom. Certainly, it was radio astronomy the one that opened
the possibility of multiwavelength astronomy, that is now more the rule than
the exception in attacking an astronomical problem. At present many studies

are being made combining results from several windows of the spectrum (plus
a theoretical interpretation).
2.1 Nobel Prizes of Physics to Radio Astronomers
Perhaps one indicator that we could use to quantify the importance of radio
astronomy is to look for results that deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics. On
my count, there have been seven Nobel Prizes in Physics given to astronomers;
of these three have been to radio astronomers:
• 1974: Martin Ryle and Antony Hewish (”for their pioneering research
in radio astrophysics: Ryle for his observations and inventions, in particular
of the aperture synthesis technique, and Hewish for his decisive role in the
discovery of pulsars”)
• 1978: Robert W. Wilson and Arno Penzias (”for their discovery of cosmic
microwave background radiation”)
• 1993: Russell A. Hulse and Joseph H. Taylor Jr. (”for the discovery of
a new type of binary pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities
for the study of gravitation”)
But it would be a mistake to judge radio astronomy (or other branch of
astronomy) by the number of Nobel Prizes in Physics received. Astronomy
has its own goals and priorities that are key to astronomy and not necessarily

204

so to physics. In what follows, we will try to present a wider panorama of the
achievements of radio astronomy.
2.2 The Discovery of Cosmic Sources “Invisible” at Other
Wavelengths
One on the most important contributions of radio astronomy was the discov-
ery of new types of sources that since they do not emit at detectable levels
at visible wavelengths, had remained “invisible” even for the most powerful
optical telescopes. In this class we have the cosmic background radiation and
the pulsars (whose discovery, as we mention before, merited a Nobel Prize in
Physics). We also have in this class the radio galaxies, that are gigantic lobes
of synchrotron-emitting plasma that have been discovered in many galaxies
(see Fig. 4). These lobes are produced by activity at the center of the galaxy
almost certainly related to the presence of a supermassive black hole with
masses between millions and billions of solar masses.
Relativistic ejecta from the surroundings of black holes are usually traced
via radio observations. The ejected plasma carries relativistic electrons and
magnetic ﬁelds and this produces synchrotron radiation that is typically
brightest in the radio regime. In addition to the radio galaxies and quasars,
now it is known that also galactic black holes with masses of a few times that
of the Sun can also produce relativistic ejecta that can be detected and stud-
ied in the radio. These black holes are part of a binary system and are called
microquasars to emphasize that they reproduce in small scale the phenomena
seen in quasars (see Fig. 5)
Another type of sources that are “invisible” at other wavelengths and
where radio astronomy provides unique information are those sources embed-
ded in large amounts of cosmic dust and gas, such as forming stars and forming
galaxies. In these sources dust opacity can be so large that even infrared radi-
ation is severely attenuated on its way out and only radio can penetrate the
obscuration. These are sources that emit at wavelengths other than radio, but
where dust obscuration renders them ‘invisible”. The origin and formation
of sources can take place in conditions of enormous dust obscuration and its
study beneﬁts greatly from the radio contributions.
3 Some Recent Contributions
As in all ﬁelds of astronomy, at radio wavelengths the scientiﬁc results have
continued to ﬂow with great continuity. In the present section I have listed
some recent results that sample the great variety of research being undertaken
at present. By far, the list is not complete and only tries to convey the vitality
and versatility of the ﬁeld.

bright twin jets emanate from the center of the galaxy (not visible in this radio
image) and develop into distorted lobes at a distance of 300 kpc from the center.
The radio structure is very large; our Galaxy has a diameter of about 25 kpc, about
a tenth of the size of this radio galaxy. Image courtesy of NRAO/AUI.
3.1 Our Galaxy
The Sun and Stars
For a summary of the type of radio observations of the Sun been carried out
in recent years, we refer the reader to section 2.5.3 of [1].
[2] were able to follow the radio emission in the wind-collision region of
the archetype W-R+O star colliding-wind binary system WR 140. They ﬁnd
that the region is a bow-shaped arc that rotates as the orbit progresses and
are able to model it.

Fig. 5. The quasar-microquasar analogy. Diagram illustrating current ideas about
quasars and microquasars (not to scale). As in quasars, the following three basic
’ingredients’ are found in microquasars: (1) a spinning black hole, (2) an accretion
disk heated by viscous dissipation, and (3) collimated jets of relativistic particles.
But in microquasars the black hole is only a few solar masses instead of several
million solar masses; the accretion disk has mean thermal temperatures of several
million degrees instead of several thousand degrees; and the particles ejected at
relativistic speeds can travel up to distances of a few light years only, instead of the
several million light years as in some giant radio galaxies. In quasars matter can be
drawn into the accretion disk from disrupted stars or from the interstellar medium
of the host galaxy, whereas in microquasars the material is being drawn from the
companion star in the binary system. In quasars the accretion disk has a size of
109 km and radiates mostly in the ultraviolet and optical wavelengths, whereas in
microquasars the accretion disk has a size of 103 km and the bulk of the radiation
leaves as X-rays. Image from [3].

Using VLBI observations, [4] have made very precise (2%) determinations
of the trigonometric parallax of T Tau South. This technique could be ex-
tended to other gyrosynchrotron stars in regions of star formation.
Molecular Clouds and Star Formation
A recent review on ultra-compact H II regions and massive star formation has
been made by [5]. An update of more recent results is presented in [6].
Observing at millimeter wavelengths, [7] and [8] have studied the density
structure of molecular cores to test the “inside-out” collapse models. A de-
tailed chemical study of the molecular core in 25 transitions of 9 molecules
was presented by [9].
[10] presented images and kinematical data of a disk of dust and molecular
gas around a high-mass protostar. This result is important because it has been
proposed that high-mass stars form through accretion of material from a cir-
cumstellar disk, in essentially the same way as low-mass stars form. However,
the alternative possibility that high-mass stars form through the merging of
several low-mass stars should be further explored. Along these lines, the ob-
servations of proper motions in the BN object and the I source in the Orion
KL region suggest the possible formation of a close binary or even a merger
after a three-body encounter between young massive stars ([11]).
Glycine, the simplest of aminoacids, may have been detected by [12] using
an improved search strategy for intrinsically weak molecular lines. However,
[13] have questioned the detection arguing that several key lines necessary for
a rigorous interstellar glycine identiﬁcation have not yet been found.
Pulsars and Supernovae
[14] reported the detection of the 2.8-second pulsar J0737–3039B as the com-
panion to the 23-millisecond pulsar J0737–3039A in a highly relativistic double
neutron star system. It is expected that this true binary pulsar system will
allow unprecedented tests of fundamental gravitational physics.
[15] report the discovery of isolated, highly polarized, two-nanosecond sub-
pulses within the giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar. The plasma struc-
tures responsible for these emissions must be smaller than one meter in size,
making them by far the smallest objects ever detected and resolved outside
the Solar System, and the brightest transient radio sources in the sky.
[16] identiﬁed 21 new millisecond pulsars in the globular cluster Terzan
5, bringing the total of known such objects in Terzan 5 to 24. These discov-
eries conﬁrm fundamental predictions of globular cluster and binary system
evolution.
[17] detected a radio counterpart to the 27 December 2004 giant ﬂare from
SGR 1806−20 and were able to obtain a high-resolution 21-cm radio spectrum
that traces the intervening interstellar neutral hydrogen clouds. Analysis of
this spectrum yields the ﬁrst direct distance measurement of SGR 1806−20:

208
Luis F. Rodr´ıguez
the source is located at a distance greater than 6.4 kpc and the authors argue
that it is nearer than 9.8 kpc. If correct, this distance estimate lowers the total
energy of the explosion and relaxes the demands on theoretical models.
[18] measured the proper motion and parallax for the pulsar B1508 + 55,
leading to model-independent estimates of its distance (2.37 ± 0.22 kpc) and
transverse velocity (1083 ± 100 km s−1). This is the highest velocity directly
measured for a neutron star.
Microquasars
The microquasar GRS 1915 + 105 has been studied exhaustively and the
combination of radio and X ray data has advanced our understanding or the
coupling between inﬂow (in an accretion disk) and outﬂow (in the relativistic
jets) in this source ([19]). [20] ﬁnd in the galaxy 3C120 that, as has been
observed in microquasars, the dips in the X-ray emission are followed by
ejections of bright superluminal knots in the radio jet. This result points to
an accretion-disk origin for the radio jets in active galaxies.
The Galactic Center
The studies of the linear and circular polarizations associated with Sgr A*
are expected to reveal crucial information with regard to the radio source
[21, 22]. A radio image of Sgr A* at a wavelength of 3.5 mm, reported by [23],
demonstrated that its size is ∼1 AU. When combined with the lower limit on
its mass, the lower limit on the mass density is 6.5 × 1021 M⊙pc−3, which
provides strong evidence favoring Sgr A* as a supermassive black hole.
[24] report a transient radio source, GCRT J1745-3009, which was detected
during a moderately wide-ﬁeld monitoring program of the Galactic Centre
region at 0.33 GHz. The characteristics of its bursts are unlike those known
for any other class of radio transient.
3.2 Extragalactic Sources
Galaxies
[25] report the detection in HI of what appears to be a dark halo that does not
contain the expected bright galaxy. A galaxy with the observed velocity width
would be expected to be 12 mag or brighter; however, deep CCD imaging has
failed to turn up a counterpart down to a surface brightness level of 27.5 B
mag arcsec−2. However, [26] argue that this object is not really a dark halo
but most likely tidal debris from the nearby galaxy NGC 4254.
[27] have reviewed the sample of 36 detected galaxies that have molecular
masses in the range of 4×109 to 1×1011 M⊙and star formation rates derived
from their FIR luminosities in the range of 300 to 5000 M⊙yr−1. These objects

are generally starbursts in centrally concentrated disks, sometimes, but not
always, associated with active galactic nuclei.
[28] measured the angular rotation and proper motion of the Triangulum
Galaxy (M33) with VLBI observations of two H2O masers on opposite sides of
the galaxy. By comparing the angular rotation rate with the inclination and
rotation speed, they obtain a distance of 730 ± 168 kiloparsecs. This distance
is consistent with the most recent Cepheid distance measurement.
Gamma Ray Bursts
Radio astronomy played a key role in the elucidation of the nature of cosmic
gamma ray bursts [29, 30].
Active Galaxies and Quasars
A review on mega-masers in external galaxies was completed by [31]. [32, 33]
have questioned the so-called radio loud/quiet dichotomy by ﬁnding many
“intermediate” radio galaxies in their samples. [34] show evidence that binary
supermassive black holes may be produced by galactic mergers as the black
holes from the two galaxies fall to the center of the merged system and form a
bound pair. They propose that the winged or X-type radio sources are galaxy
pairs in which this merging has occurred.
3.3 Cosmology
A major development was the accurate measurement and interpretation of
the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background [35]. The spectrum of
amplitudes of temperature (or brightness) ﬂuctuations expanded in multipole
moments reported by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)
satellite is a remarkable achievement that allowed accurate determination of
the main cosmological constants [36, 37]. The detection of polarization in the
cosmic microwave background [38] conﬁrmed the predictions of the standard
theory.
There also signiﬁcant advances in the measurement of the Sunyaev-
Zeldovich eﬀect in clusters of galaxies [39, 40]. The realization that the ﬁrst
generation of stars may be detectable by means of radio observations of red-
shifted atomic hydrogen [41] triggered the development of ad hoc radio tele-
scopes for this purpose and results may be obtained in a few years.
4 The Challenges of the Future
4.1 International Level
At the international level the radio community faces two major challenges:
1) the construction and operation of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array

210
Luis F. Rodr´ıguez

of NRAO/AUI and ESO.
(ALMA, see Fig. 6) and 2) the design and ﬁnancing of the Square Kilometer
Array (SKA).
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) project is a millimeter
and sub-millimeter interferometer originally planned to be constituted by 64
radio antennas, each 12 meters in diameter. The project will be located in
the Chajnantor plateau in northern Chile, one of the highest (5,000 meters),
driest places on Earth. It is well underway, with major contributions from the
USA, Europe and Japan, as well as other countries. This interferometer will
revolutionize all we know from studies in that region of the electromagnetic
spectrum. Perhaps the major challenge is, with the rising costs of petroleum
and steel, to avoid a downsizing of the design (from example, reducing the
number of antennas from 64 to 50) that could compromise the expected high
performance (see [42] for an update on this issue).
The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project has as its major goal to be the
next generation interferometer for meter and centimeter wavelengths. As you
may remember at the beginning of this article we mentioned that since radio
wavelengths vary by a factor of 104, it is impossible to do all radio astronomy
with a single instrument. ALMA will then cover the short wavelengths, from
a few millimeters and shorter, and SKA will cover the longer wavelengths.
At present, the Very Large Array (VLA) is the major centimeter interferom-
eter in the world and is being upgraded, with collaborations from the USA,
Canada, and M´exico to become the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA).
New receivers and wider bandwidths will give one or two more decades of

premier science with the EVLA. However, the total area of the EVLA is at
present some 13,000 square meters. The SKA project proposes to build a new
interferometer with a total area of about one square kilometer, about two
orders of magnitude larger than the EVLA. The challenge here is that some
new solution for the building of large surfaces in a relatively inexpensive way
is needed. Several countries are interested in hosting the SKA.
4.2 Mexican Level
In a developing country like M´exico, radio astronomy and all other scientiﬁc
activities are also just developing. At present, we count with about one dozen
radio astronomers distributed in a handful of institutions. The Center of Ra-
dio Astronomy and Astrophysics (CRyA) of the National University has led
a successful eﬀort to participate in the EVLA project, getting in exchange
competitive access to both the EVLA and ALMA, in the same conditions of a

USA university. Another institution in M´exico, the National Institute for As-
trophysics, Optics, and Electronics has undertaken, in collaboration with the
University of Massachusetts, the construction of the Large Millimeter Tele-
scope (LMT, see Fig. 7). This telescope is a 50-m diameter single-dish tele-
scope optimized for astronomical observations at millimeter wavelengths (0.85
mm≤λ ≤4 mm). A principal scientiﬁc goal of the LMT is to understand the
physical process of structure formation and its evolutionary history through-
out the Universe. The telescope site is Volc´an Sierra Negra (lat. of +19◦),
situated about 100 km east of INAOE, in the Mexican state of Puebla, at an
altitude of 4,600 m. This project is well underway and it is expected that it
will see ﬁrst light in the year 2008. The LMT, in combination with the com-
petitive access to the EVLA and ALMA as well as with the share of time that
mexican astronomers have in the Gran Telescopio Canarias (Large Canary
Islands Telescope) in Spain, open many observational possibilities that the
young generation of mexican astronomers will seize.

Introduction: γ-rays and γ-ray Astronomy
Gamma-rays were ﬁrst found as photons with energies in the range of tens of
keV to several MeV produced by unstable nuclei. High energy photons can
be produced by other types of processes, like inverse Compton scattering, ex-
panding the γ-ray spectrum to arbitrarily high energies. A photon with energy
E ≥mec2 ≃0.511 MeV can be deﬁned as a γ-ray, making an exception at
lower energies for (line) photons produced by radioactive decay. A ﬁner divi-
sion of the spectrum is often made on instrumental basis: low energy γ-rays are
detectable via the photoelectric (E <∼1 MeV) or Compton eﬀects (1–30 MeV);
high energy γ-rays (30 MeV–30 GeV) with pair production telescopes in or-
bit; very high γ-rays (100 GeV–10 TeV) are observed through the ˇCerenkov
emission of secondary particles in the atmosphere; ﬁnally, ultra high energy
γ-rays (E >∼10 TeV) can be studied by the direct detection of secondary par-
ticles in extended air shower arrays or the ﬂuorescence emission they cause in
atmospheric nitrogen nuclei. This review addresses the pair production and
ˇCerenkov regimes, with lower emphasis on the low energy band.
Gamma-ray astronomy had an early -but slow- start with the ﬁrst de-
tection of ˇCerenkov light from atmospheric cascades, reported in 1953 [1].
In the 1960s the technique was already in use for the search of celestial γ-
ray sources [2], but today we know that those instruments were too crude
to permit real detections, as an eﬀective method for separating cosmic-rays
from γ-rays is mandatory. Solid evidence for celestial sources came from the
OSO-III satellite, a spark chamber which detected the Galactic plane in the
early 1970s [3]. Shortly after, SAS-II conﬁrmed the OSO-III results, with evi-
dence for a handful of point sources [4], prior to the second COS-B catalog of
high energy γ-ray sources which contains 25 entries [5]. At present more than
250 sources of photons with E > 100 MeV are known, as listed in the third
catalog compiled with EGRET on-board of the Compton Gamma-Ray Ob-
servatory (CGRO) [6]. An attempt to join results from diﬀerent experiments
lead to the general γ-ray source catalog [7]. In the low energy γ-ray band the

ﬁrst COMPTEL catalog reports about 30 steady sources in the 0.75–30 MeV
interval [8]. In the hardest X-ray bands, the IBIS-Integral team compiled a
catalog of over 200 sources at 20–100 keV from their Galactic plane survey [9].
In the absence of MeV and GeV telescopes in orbit, γ-ray astronomy is
presently relying on the soft γ-ray data of Integral, in the 100s keV ,and on
the new generation of ˇCerenkov telescopes, like the productive HESS array
working around 300 GeV [10]. HESS is been joined by the MAGIC large
aperture telescopes and the Veritas array [11, 12]. These pointed air ˇCerenkov
telescopes are complementary to water ˇCerenkov experiments, like MILA-
GRO [13], that continuously cover a sizable fraction of the sky, although at
lower point source sensitivity. HAWC, a proposed 90,000 m2 high altitude wa-
ter ˇCerenkov tank to be located above 4000 meter sea-level, has the potential
of a wide area survey with a point source sensitivity equivalent to the Whipple
telescope and prompt coverage of TeV transients [14]. New pair production
telescopes, based on solid state technology, are also coming along. AGILE
is an Italian compact telescope of sensitive area comparable to EGRET but
much improved oﬀ-axis performance, almost ready for launch [15]. It is similar
in concept, but smaller than GLAST, the Gamma-ray Large Aperture Space
Telescope that will be in orbit by the end of 2007 [16]. GLAST will have a large
collecting area, ﬁeld of view and improved tracker reconstruction, resulting in
over an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity compared to EGRET. This
will result in an energy coverage overlap with ground based telescopes.
I will describe physical absorption processes behind γ-ray telescopes, often
relevant in astrophysical scenarios (§1); then proceed to the most common
production mechanisms of γ-rays, like neutral pion production and inverse
Compton scattering (§2); this will lead to an outline of some relevant results
in γ-ray astronomy and related astrophysical scenarios (§3).
1 Gamma-ray Absorption and Detection
The three basic interaction processes for high energy photons are the photo-
electric eﬀect, Compton scattering and pair production, each dominant in a
diﬀerent energy band (Figure 1). Photoelectric absorption is the basic process
behind hard X-ray and low energy γ-ray telescopes; Compton scattering, the
preferred absorption process at 1–10 MeV, is the basis for Compton telescopes;
and pair production is the underlying process behind high energy space tele-
scopes and very high energy ground-based telescopes and experiments.
1.1 Photoelectric Eﬀect
In the photoelectric eﬀect a photon of energy E is absorbed by an atom of
ionization potential φ ≤E. Most hard X-ray and low-energy γ-ray telescopes
are based on photoelectric absorption in crystals like NaI. These have intrinsic
poor angular resolution, requiring collimators or other devices to improve their

response. The development of codded mask apertures has given a noticeable
improvement in angular resolution, >∼1 arc-min for telescopes like Swift and
Integral, wide ﬁeld of view monitors to search for γ-ray bursts (GRBs) [17, 18].
OSSE and Integral are diﬀerent low energy telescopes conceived with suﬃcient
energy resolution and mapping capabilities to study the annihilation line at
0.511 MeV and radioactive decay lines in the interstellar medium [19, 20].
1.2 Compton Scattering
Compton scattering is the energy exchange between a photon and a charged
particle, usually an electron, eγ →eγ. Seen in the rest frame of the electron
prior to the interaction, a photon of initial energy ℏω acquires an energy
ℏω1 =
ℏω
1 + (ℏω/mc2) (1 −ˆk · ˆk1)
,
(1)
with ˆk and ˆk1 the initial and ﬁnal direction of the photon momentum. Expres-
sion (1) describes the loss of energy of a photon scattered by an electron at
rest. The diﬀerential cross section, dσ/dΩ, is given by the Klein-Nishima ex-
pression, with dipolar shape at low energies and a well-deﬁned preference for
a photon recoil at high energies [21]. The total cross section decreases slowly
from σ = 8πr2
e/3 at low energies to σ = r2
e(1/2 + ln 2x)/x at high energies,
with re = e2/mc2 the classical electron radius and x = ℏω/mc2.
The Compton cross section dominates for 0.5 MeV <∼ℏω <∼30 MeV
(Fig. 1), with a dependence on the composition of the target [22]. This is a
very thought energy regime technically with the added problem of a very high
background induced by cosmic-ray collisions in the spacecrafts. COMPTEL,

the only telescope to perform a sky survey in the low MeV range, followed a
two level conﬁguration design, with Compton scattering occuring in the upper
D1 layer of NaI detectors followed by photoelectric absorption in the lower D2
layer. The locations and energy deposits of the interactions, E1 and E2, were
measured and the scattering angle was recovered from eq. 1, with the total
photon energy given by Eγ = E1 +E2. However, the scattering angle by itself
is insuﬃcient to point to the celestial source and telescopes like COMPTEL
suﬀered from a severe azimuthal indetermination, resulting in a ring shaped
point spread function of tens of degrees radius and over a degree wide. Another
drawback was that Eγ = E1+E2 assumes the scattered photon to be absorbed
in D2, rather than re-scattered outside the instrument. This was known not
to be the general case and was considered in the COMPTEL analysis soft-
ware. Even through the use of the Compton eﬀect has proven to be much
harder than the photoelectric eﬀect or pair production, the increased cross
section at MeV energies demands pursuing the design of new types of Comp-
ton telescopes. To obtain a signiﬁcant improvement in sensitivity, Compton
telescopes must include features like measuring the recoil electron to suppress
the azimuthal uncertainty, as in the design of MEGA [23].
1.3 Pair Production
Two photon pair production, like γγ →e+e−, is an important process in re-
gions with high photon density, like the environment GRBs or the vicinity of
accretion disks. It also has been found to have an important eﬀect over cosmo-
logical distances. In the center of momentum reference frame (CM), two pho-
tons of identical energy ω produce a particle pair of same energy1, γ = ω. In-
variance under Lorentz transformations gives ω =

ω1ω2(1 −cos θ)/2, where
ω1 and ω2 are the photon energies in the observer frame and θ is the angle
between their momenta. The total cross section, of the form σ = r2
ef(ω), has
a relatively narrow proﬁle, decaying rapid from ω = 1 to ω ∼10. The diﬀer-
ential angular cross section is roughly isotropic for pair production just above
threshold, ω >∼1, becoming biased to pairs moving in the same directions as
the original photons (in the CM!) at high energies.
Direct one photon pair production γ →e−e+, forbidden in vacuum, can
occur in the presence of a ﬁeld or medium able to warrant energy-momentum
conservation. In matter, pair production dominates over Compton scattering
for energies above 30 or 50 MeV (Fig. 1). At high energies the cross section
is given by the Bethe-Heitler cross section [21],

so far. Their design is based on combining a converter system, where electron-

positron pairs are materialized, with a tracker system, to reconstruct the tra-
jectories of each e±, and a calorimeter, to measure the total energy of the pair.
GLAST incorporates sensitive solid state elements in the tracker, avoiding the
use of expendable gas needed in previous spark chamber based telescopes.
When applied to air, expression (2) gives an absorption path of ξp =
µmH/σ ≈37 g cm−2 at ℏω ≃1 TeV. With a total depth of 1032 g cm−2,
the Earth atmosphere is about 28 absorption lengths thick, ensuring the ab-
sorption of incoming γ-ray photons. The bremsstrahlung (§ 2.3) e →γe and
pair production cross sections are intimately related at high energies, result-
ing in very similar paths for secondary high energy electrons to produce new
photons and photons to produce new pairs. The succession of pair production
and bremsstrahlung processes results in the development of electromagnetic
cascades, which grows until Compton scattering takes over pair production
(ℏω ∼10 MeV) and photo-ionization over bremsstrahlung (γmc2 ∼84 MeV).
Secondary particles of a cascade can reach sea level for primaries with 1015eV,
allowing the use of arrays of particle detectors as γ-ray detectors. In practise
the atmosphere acts as a γ-ray converter and ground-based telescopes serve
as calorimeters, detecting secondaries either directly or through the ˇCerenkov
radiation produced when moving faster than light in the medium. The index
of refraction of air is n ≃1 + 3 × 10−4, and the ˇCerenkov condition v > c/n
becomes γ > 1/

2(n −1) for (n −1) ≪1, or γmc2 >∼20 MeV for air.
One of the main problems for ground-based γ-ray telescopes resides in
the high ﬂux of cosmic-rays, which also produce atmospheric cascades. The
ﬁrst interaction of a cosmic-ray nucleon in the atmosphere diﬀers in pro-
ducing charged and neutral pions, leading to a more complex cascade with
muonic, nucleonic and electromagnetic components. Cosmic-rays can be re-
jected through numerically modelling nucleon initiated and photon initiated
cascades and comparing the predicted and measured distributions of ˇCerenkov
light or particles on the ground. Imaging the ˇCerenkov light provides an eﬀec-
tive method of cosmic-ray rejection, as ﬁrst demonstrated by the 1989 Whipple
high signiﬁcance detection of the Crab nebula [24].

A diﬀerent kind of very high energy γ-ray detector is made taking into
account that the index of refraction of water is 1.33, implying a threshold
γ > 1.52. Practically any cascade e± reaching water radiates therein. Wa-
ter ˇCerenkov detectors are better suited for high altitude sites in order to
maximize the number of cascade e±. MILAGRO is among the ﬁrst of these
TeV monitors that observe a large portion of the sky and, through precise
timing of signals in its phototubes, they reconstruct the direction of arrival
of events [13]. Larger area detectors, like the 150×150m MiniHawc proposal,
may be able to provide the sensitivity required to a proper monitoring of
ﬂaring celestial sources like active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and GRBs.
2 Gamma-ray Production
2.1 γ-rays from Nuclear Decay
The production of nuclear γ-rays in the interstellar medium can be due to
the excitation of atomic nuclei by cosmic-rays or through direct production of
unstable species in violent events, like novae or supernovae. A particular case
of interest in astrophysics is the neutron capture reaction, n + H →D + γ,
which gives 2.23 MeV photons, as observed in solar ﬂares [25]. Gamma-ray
line astronomy has succeeded in detecting the decay of radioactive species of
particular astrophysical interest [20]. For example, COMPTEL and Integral
have mapped the distribution of the 1.8 MeV line produced by the decay of
26Al in the Galactic plane. The short lived 44Ti, with a decay time of just
80 years, was detected in the young supernova remnant Cas A [26].
2.2 Electron - Positron Annihilation
Electron-positron annihilation, usually e+e−→γγ, can proceed through two
photon or three photon production, e+e−→γγγ, the later via the intermedi-
ate creation of a positronium e+e−bound system. In the CM the cross section
is inversely proportional to the speed of each of the particles, σ ∝1/β, favour-
ing annihilation of low speed pairs and the emission of a thin line spectrum.

γ-ray Astrophysics
221
The decay of the positronium into three photons gives an underlying contin-
uum of photons with energies ℏω <∼mc2. This Galactic plane emission was
ﬁrst detected with a balloon experiment, then measured with OSSE on board
CGRO (Fig. 3) and more recently better mapped with Integral [27, 19, 28].
2.3 Bremsstrahlung
Bremsstrahlung radiation is produced when an electron of energy E = γmc2
is deﬂected during encounters with atomic nuclei of charge Ze. A relativistic
electron travelling through a medium of nuclei number density n suﬀers an
exponential energy loss, dE/dt = −(c/x0)E , of characteristic length,

for a mixture of media. For air this gives ξb ≃36 g/cm2,
close to the pair production value, both processes working at the same scales in
atmospheric cascades. The relativistic bremsstrahlung energy spectrum is ﬂat,
equivalent to a photon number spectrum N(ℏω) ∝1/ℏω. When integrating
over a power-law distribution of electrons with E ≥E0, spectral index p and
energy density ue one obtains a power-law spectrum

2.4 Inverse Compton Scattering
Compton scattering can be a mechanism of photon energy loss or gain, de-
pending on the electron involved. Equation (1) applies in the original rest
frame of the electron and does not describe photons interacting with relativis-
tic electrons, i.e. inverse Compton scattering. This is better described with
transformations to and from the CM frame, where the energies of the pho-
tons (ωcm) and electrons (γcm), related by γ2
cm = 1 + ω2
cm, remain unchanged
through the interaction, which consists in a re-orientation of the momenta
weighted with the CM diﬀerential cross section. The scattering of a photon
from ω to ω1 seen by an arbitrary observer, can be translated to the CM
using,

with θ the interaction angle (observer) and →indicating the β →1 limit.
The γ-ray spectrum arising from the interaction of isotropic populations
of monoenergetic electrons and photons is obtained considering the ˆk′

distribution consistent with the angular cross section, averaged and integrated
over incidence angle θ. This mono-mono spectrum can be weighted with input
photon and electron populations, like a black body and power-law combina-
tion, to give the Compton component of a γ-ray spectrum model.
The Synchrotron Connection and Curvature Radiation
The distribution of cosmic-ray electrons is generally much harder to know
than that of nucleons. As their energy losses are much more rapid, cosmic-ray
electrons are short lived and hardly propagate after acceleration, as shown
by the low ﬂux of cosmic-ray electrons above Earth’s atmosphere, ∼1% of
the total cosmic-ray ﬂux [29]. Considering the energy dependence of electron
synchrotron lifetime, τ = 0.93 × 106 yrs (B/3µG)−2(γmc2/TeV)−1 and their
highly diﬀusive propagation, their density is bound to be a complicated func-
tion of the distance to cosmic-ray sources, magnetic ﬁeld and energy. On the
other hand, the synchrotron radiation of cosmic-ray electrons in galactic mag-
netic ﬁelds is the origin of the radio emission of the galaxy. The spectral index
of the optically thin region of the radio spectrum, s, is directly related to the
spectral index of the electron distribution, p, through s = (p −1)/2.
Synchrotron emission works mostly below the γ-ray range. However, the
same basic process is behind curvature radiation, a relevant emission mech-
anism in highly magnetized neutron stars where energetic charged particles
are constrained to move along magnetic ﬁeld lines. Relativistic e± moving
along a ﬁeld line have signiﬁcant radial acceleration due to the large curva-
ture radius, Rc, deﬁned by the assumed dipolar geometry (R∗<∼Rc <∼c/Ω).
This gentle radial acceleration translates into radiation in the γ-ray range.
Energy losses, d(γmc2)/dt = γ4 "

, occur in timescales larger than
the e± travel time along the magnetic ﬁeld lines for γmc2 <∼1 TeV -assuming
Rc = R∗= 10 km- with the production of GeV photons. Given an acceleration
mechanism along the magnetic ﬁeld lines, the curved motion ensures MeV to
GeV emission through the standard synchrotron formulas. Elaborate pulsar
models have been constructed following this principle [30, 31].
2.5 Hadronic Production of γ-rays
Energetic hadrons produce γ-rays during nuclear collisions, the most relevant
process for high energy astrophysics been the intermediate production and

γ-ray Astrophysics
223
decay of neutral pions, π0 →γγ. In normal galaxies most of the γ-rays come
from cosmic-ray nucleons colliding with interstellar medium particles. More
violent scenarios involve hadronic collisions in mildly relativistic shocks apply
to supernovae, while highly relativistic shocks occur in GRBs or blazars.
Neutral pion decay into two photons of identical energy, ω = mπ/2 and
opposite momenta in the pion rest frame. In the observer frame the photon
energies are are ω± = γπmπ(1 ± βπ cos θ)/2, with βπ the pion velocity and θ
the angle between the photon momenta in the pion frame and the pion veloc-
ity in the observer frame. Averaging over solid angle, photons are produced
with a ﬂat spectrum in the range 1
2γπmπ(1−βπ) ≤ω ≤1
2γπmπ(1+βπ). Tak-
ing one step back, neutral pion production is mediated by the production of
the intermediate ∆(1232) particle, conserving energy and momentum at head
step. This has an impact on the π0 and γ-ray spectra produced by protons or
nucleons of given kinetic energy, as calculated for the cosmic-ray population
of the Milky Way [32].
2.6 Particle Acceleration
High energy electrons and nucleons are the basic ingredient for γ-ray pro-
duction and the fundamental connection between cosmic-ray and γ-ray astro-
physics. Except for the low energy range, γ-ray production requires a particle
acceleration mechanism. In 1949 Fermi proved that a series of collisions be-
tween a macroscopic system and a microscopic charged particle can lead to a
power-law spectrum of high energy particles, similar to the observed cosmic-
ray spectrum [33]. Fermi ﬁrst consideration of particle acceleration due to
interstellar turbulence evolved to the present paradigm of diﬀusive shock ac-
celeration in supernova fronts as the source of Galactic cosmic-rays [29]. With
the important exceptions of electrodynamical particle acceleration models in
pulsars, either in polar caps or outer gaps [34, 35], or in supermassive black
holes [36], most γ-ray production scenarios involve shock acceleration. Accel-
eration models can be divided as leptonic or hadronic [37, 38]. Electrons can
be accelerated up to radiative loss limit, while acceleration of proton and nu-
clei is limited to their Larmor radii reaching the size of the accelerating region,
ℓ. Hadrons can reach larger energies, but -even assuming no losses- they are
ultimately limited by the accelerating region, the velocity of the front shock,
βc, and the magnetic ﬁeld, B, to Emax <∼βℓB, as illustrated by Hillas [39].
3 Celestial Sources of γ-rays
The third EGRET catalog contains 271 entries of which close to two thirds
are unidentiﬁed γ-ray sources of E > 100 MeV photons [6]. Non catalogued
known EGRET sources are the Galactic plane, GRBs, the Moon and the ex-
tragalactic γ-ray background [40, 41, 42, 43]. The signiﬁcation non detection of
the quiet Sun has a bearing on normal stars as a class [42]. Identiﬁed sources

include solar ﬂares, pulsars, normal galaxies and radio loud ﬂat spectrum
blazars [44, 45]. We believe unidentiﬁed sources include Galactic sources like
radio quiet pulsars, supernova remnants and, maybe, black hole related ob-
jects like miniquasars [46]. Recently HESS has found several unidentiﬁed γ-ray
sources along the Galactic plane which are under investigation [47]. Another
active topic of research is pair production absorption of TeV photons, an un-
expected mechanism to explore the far infrared extragalactic background [48].
3.1 The Galactic Plane and Star Forming Galaxies
The most prominent feature in the 100 MeV sky is the diﬀuse emission of the
Galactic plane found by the OSO-III satellite [3]. This emission is fairly well
understood and modelled as the interaction of cosmic-rays with interstellar
gas [40]. Supernova are believed to provide the cosmic-rays which create the
Galactic γ-ray emission through bremsstrahlung, π0 production and inverse
Compton scattering [49]. This process must also be in action in other normal
galaxies. If cosmic-rays are produced locally within the galaxies, their γ-ray
emission must scale with supernova rate and interstellar medium density. The
non-detection of M 31 and the SMC suggests their cosmic-ray density is lower
than that of the Milky Way and the overall paradigm of the local origin
of cosmic-rays. The detection of some nearby normal galaxies seems to be
certain during the GLAST era, at least for the LMC, the SMC, M 31 and
maybe even M 33 [50]. Within the same scenario, starburst galaxies must
possess a high density of cosmic-rays and be γ-ray sources. EGRET was not
able to detect a sample of starbursts galaxies but the upper limits do not
constrain signiﬁcantly the properties of these, like the transfer of SNe energy
into cosmic-rays [51]. GLAST will have good prospects for detecting starburst
galaxies, from NGC 253 to Arp 220, and luminous infrared galaxies also [52].

COMPTEL and EGRET histograms. Right: the GeV light curve of the Crab pulsar.
Dots indicate the energies -right-hand side axis- and phases of E > 10 GeV photons.
3.2 Pulsars
Pulsars were the ﬁrst type of γ-ray source identiﬁed, their pulsed signal pro-
viding a perfect identiﬁcation signature. The Crab pulsar was found as a γ-ray
source in balloon experiments [53], while the Vela pulsar required the conﬁr-
mation of marginal balloon detections by SAS-II [54, 55]. Both pulsars were
clearly seen by COS-B [56] and remained the only pulsars ﬁrmly established
as high energy γ-ray emitters until the launch of CGRO. EGRET detected
over half a dozen pulsars above 100 MeV [57], with COMPTEL supplying
signiﬁcant detections in the 0.75–30 MeV range for the Crab and Vela and
signiﬁcant non-detections of Geminga and PSR 1706–44 [58]. Of particular
relevance during the CGRO era was the discovery that Geminga is a radio-
quiet γ-ray loud pulsar [59]. This had led to the idea that of most of the
unidentiﬁed EGRET sources might be radio-quiet γ-ray pulsars [60].
Crab, Vela and Geminga are the brightest sources above 100 MeV. As
pulsars they show a double peaked light curve with ∆φ ≃0.4 peak-to-peak
separation for Crab and Vela, and ∆φ ≃0.5 for Geminga. But they do show
their own peculiarities. For example, the secondary peak of the Crab light
curve becomes dominant in the MeV region to return to a secondary status
above 100 MeV [61]. The Crab light curve keeps a similar shape over more than
nine orders of magnitude, from the near infrared to 1 GeV, although the pulse
separation has a slight but real increase with energy (Fig. 5). PSR B1706–44
is a relatively bright pulsar coincident with a COS-B source which shows a
single broad pulse [62]. The detection of the old pulsar PSR B1055–52 implies a
high degree of beaming together with a high eﬃciency in converting rotational
energy into γ-rays, prompting for an age-eﬃciency relation. Interesting physics
apply to PSR B1509–58, a pulsar with a large magnetic ﬁeld, B ∼Bcr ≃
4.4×1013 G, detected by COMPTEL up to >∼10 MeV, where photon splitting
appears to play a major role in its magnetosphere [64, 65].

226
Alberto Carrami˜nana
ˇCerenkov telescopes have detected a few plerions, most notably the Crab,
but have found no pulsar to date. Interestingly, the Crab is a pulsed source
in the highest end of the EGRET range, certainly up to E >∼4 GeV, with
marginal evidence above 10 GeV. In fact the highest energy photon detected
by EGRET, at 120 GeV, is in phase with the Crab main pulse (Fig. 5). This
is below but close to the 0.25–4 TeV range where the Whipple telescope ﬁnd
no pulsations [66] and inside the energy interval of the Celeste experiment,
which set a limit of 12% to the pulsed fraction of the Crab signal above
60 GeV [67]. GLAST will be able to resolve this near-conﬂict situation, mea-
suring the pulsed and unpulsed components of the Crab spectrum between
10 and 100 GeV. Although the common consensus is that the Crab emission
seen by ˇCerenkov telescopes originates in the nebula, it is theoretically feasible
that pulsars might produce unpulsed high energy photons [68].
3.3 Supernova Remnants and Unidentiﬁed EGRET Sources
Supernova remnants (SNR) have been expected to be γ-ray sources since
the 1949 paper of Fermi -who associated particle acceleration to interstellar
turbulence in 1954 [33, 69]. Moving shocks are able to accelerate charged
particles with a power-law spectrum close to E−2. Indirect evidence that SNRs
are the sources of cosmic-rays resides in the energetics of supernova explosions,
which release energy at a rate large enough to sustain the cosmic-ray energy
density. SNR have the power and the means to produce Galactic cosmic-rays,
with energies up to E <∼1015 eV [70]. There is indeed a positional correlation
between EGRET sources and SNRs [71]. However, the physical association is
not fully conﬁrmed by the EGRET data, which cannot rule out a pulsar origin
for the GeV emission. A powerful diagnostic would be for GLAST to resolve
the extended emission structure of a SNR. In that respect the most clear
evidence for diﬀusive shock acceleration of cosmic-rays comes from ˇCerenkov
telescopes, like HEGRA and Hess, which have been able to map the extended
TeV emission in some SNR [72].
Most of the 3EG catalog entries are unidentiﬁed γ-ray sources within our
Galaxy, with at least two populations of objects: bright sources in the Galac-
tic plane, |b| <∼5◦, form a ﬁrst group of objects; a second group is made of
fainter sources forming an halo around the Galactic center direction [73]. The
ﬁrst group matches the distribution of known γ-ray pulsars and is believed
to correspond to young objects: the second group might be formed by older
recycled pulsars, like millisecond pulsars, as suggested by Grenier [74]. Other
Galactic sources could be black holes, miniquasars and molecular clouds. Al-
though most of the unidentiﬁed sources are Galactic, a smaller component of
extragalactic objects is not ruled out.
Motivated by the serendipitous discovery of an unidentiﬁed TeV sources,
the HESS collaboration has been performing a Galactic Plane survey which
has uncover more unidentiﬁed γ-ray sources. GLAST might accurately locate
some of these to encourage their multiwavelength identiﬁcation [75, 47].

γ-ray Astrophysics

3.4 Blazars and the Extragalactic Background
Prior to the 1991 launch of CGRO only one extragalactic γ-ray source was
known, 3C273 as observed by COS-B [76]. Aside from a single radio galaxy
detection, Cen A, EGRET detected ﬁfty to eighty radio loud ﬂat spectrum
sources [45]. These radio sources correspond with quasars or Bl Lac objects, a
large fraction of which show strong variability and/or superluminical motions.
The data support scenarios based on the supermassive black hole paradigm of
AGNs. Particles accelerated in relativistic shocks inside jets pointed towards
the observer produce γ-rays either through π0 decay of hadrons or inverse
Compton scattering of X-ray or optical photons from an accretion disk, or
photons produced by synchroton from the same relativistic electrons, forming
the Synchrotron Self Compton picture. The present data cannot distinguish
between hadronic and leptonic models.
During the 1990s, ˇCerenkov telescopes failed to detect most of EGRET
blazars, except for the nearest of them, Mk 421. The TeV detections of Mk 501
(undetected by EGRET) prompted the suggestion that TeV photons could
be absorbed by the IR extragalactic background [77]. Further observations
provided blazar spectra ﬁtted with a power law spectrum attenuated with a
reasonable infrared background model [78]. In fact the background responsible
of attenuating TeV photons has not been directly measured and the γ-ray data
are providing lower limits, still in debate [48]. GLAST will be able to detect
over a thousand blazars, providing numerous lines of sight to test extragalactic
pair absorption, in coordination with HESS, MAGIC and VERITAS.
The extragalactic γ background was found and measured by SAS-II [79].
EGRET determined the 30 MeV–100 GeV spectrum, with COMPTEL cover-
ing 0.8–30 MeV [43, 80]. Although the ﬂux and spectral index are consistent
with non resolved blazars, much interest in its study with γ-ray instruments
remains due to the possibility of dark matter signatures [81].
3.5 Gamma-ray Bursts in the GeV Regime
GRBs are extremely brief and intense burst of high energy radiation. They
are isotropically distributed and have been associated to high redshift galax-
ies which, together with their non-repeatability, led to models which consider
catastrophic events, either highly beamed supernova explosions or mergers
of compact objects, like neutron stars and/or black holes. They often show
afterglow emission at lower energies, which allowed the identiﬁcation of long
duration (> 2 s) events with high redshift galaxies. They are extensively re-
viewed in the literature and will not be described in detail here (Ramirez Ruiz
in this volume). As they are more easily monitored in the tens to hundreds of
keV, their behaviour in the actual γ-ray regime is deduced from a relatively
small sample of events detected by COMPTEL and EGRET. GRBs show
power-law, or broken power-law spectra in the MeV region [82]. Of particular
interest was GRB 940217, where GeV photons were detected over an hour af-
ter the BATSE trigger, probably as a high energy afterglow [83]. These γ-ray

228
Alberto Carrami˜nana
data established the need of anisotropic emission to overcome pair produc-
tion absorption in the highly photon dense environment [84]. The detection
of a 18 GeV photon in this event suggests that ˇCerenkov detections might be
feasible. Another burst of interest was GRB 941017, modelled with a distinct
high energy component extending beyond 200 MeV, not seen before in previ-
ous GRBs [85]. GLAST is expected to observe dozens of GRBs, probing their
high energy emission, providing excellent targets for ground-based telescopes

Summary. The LIGO gravitational wave detectors have achieved their designed
sensitivity, and are currently in operation. We describe the technology of the detec-
tors, as well as results from the analysis of some of the data collected so far.
1 Introduction
The existence of gravitational waves is a beautiful, if straightforward, pre-
diction of Einstein’s theory of relativity, arising from the deep relationship
between space and time: dynamic changes in matter distribution will distort
the space time, and the space-time “ripples” will travel outwards from the
source, carrying energy and precious information about the astrophysics of the
source. Many black hole scenarios would not emit electromagnetic waves and
thus be invisible to instruments detecting diﬀerent wavelengths of light; they
would, however, produce gravitational waves traveling at the speed of light.
Many other astrophysical sources (supernovae, collisions of neutron stars,...)
would produce both electromagnetic and gravitational waves, but they would
carry very diﬀerent information: gravitational waves would tell us about the
macroscopic structure of the mass of the source and the eﬀects on the space
time produced by the large relativistic ﬁelds. Gravitational waves interact
very weakly with matter: most of the universe is essentially transparent to
the traveling waves; the information encoded in them is pristine.
Gravitational waves distort space-time, changing distances between freely
falling objects (acting as coordinate markers) by an amount proportional
to the gravitational wave strength, and the distance between the objects:
∆L = hL. Gravitational waves have a transverse and quadrupolar nature: a
plane wave would change distances in the plane perpendicular to the direc-
tion of propagation, and it would make distances shorter in one direction, and
longer in the perpendicular direction, as shown in Figure 1. There are two po-
larizations of a plane wave, called “×” and “+” corresponding to maximum
distortions along two directions 45◦apart.

polarization.
Gravitational waves are produced by accelerated mass quadrupoles Qij,
and the strength of the wave is proportional to the second derivative of
the mass quadrupole, and inversely proportional to the distance r to the
source: h ≈2G ¨Q/c4r. The rate of energy radiated away from the source
is P = (G/5c5)(d3Q/dt3)2: the source will be changed due to the loss of radi-
ated energy. An orbiting system of the most compact of stars, neutron stars,
is known to exist from pulsar observations, and forms a radiating quadru-
pole, thus emitting gravitational waves. The energy of the system decreases
due to the emission of gravitational waves: the orbit shrinks, and the orbit-
ing frequency of the system increases (from Newton’s law ω2 = GM/r3).
The agreement of the predicted change in orbit parameters has been beauti-
fully demonstrated with observations of the ﬁrst pulsar binary system PSR
1913+16, discovered by Hulse and Taylor in 1974 [1].
Since gravitational waves do exist, as proven by the Hulse Taylor system,
it is the nature of human curiosity to try to directly detect them. However, the
eﬀect of gravitational waves is very small: a binary system of neutron stars,
about 10 diameters or 200 km away from each other, at a distance r from
Earth, would emit gravitational waves of about 300 Hz with an amplitude of
h ∼10−22(20MPc/r). The changes in distance produced by a source in the
Virgo Cluster is an atom diameter for a distance of several million kilometers!
This shows the incredible challenge to measuring such small eﬀects, even from
large astrophysical systems. However, we will show that present detectors
can achieve measurements of sub-nuclear distances, over distance of kilometer
scale, making the direct observation of gravitational waves a plausible, and
very exciting, enterprise.

2 Interferometric Gravitational Wave Detectors
The quadrupolar nature of gravitational waves seems naturally appropriate
to be measured by some of the oldest precision measurement instruments,
Michelson interferometers. Such a detector measures diﬀerences in length be-
tween perpendicular arms, so it can be naturally adapted to measure the
eﬀect of a passing gravitational wave that changes the length of its arms.
However, even for a 4km long interferometer (as they now exist!), a gravi-
tational wave with strength h ∼10−22 produces a diﬀerence in arm length
of ∆L = hL ≤10−18m, or a thousandth of a nucleon diameter. The mea-
surement of such a small quantity, with an instrument with km scale, seems
to defy quantum mechanics, not just common sense. Are gravitational waves
detectable? The answer is yes, if the question is well deﬁned, and the instru-
ment sensitive enough. First, even though we talk about sub-nuclear length
scales, the question does not enter the realm of quantum uncertainty, because
we are not measuring the position of any one nucleon, or atom, but instead
we are measuring changes in distances deﬁned by macroscopic objects, whose
position is well deﬁned, well beyond nuclear distances: in other words, we are
measuring the average position of many atoms, which is better deﬁned than
the position of any one of the atoms forming the system. The quantum nature
of the world does limit the sensitivity of the measuring instruments, but the
limitations depend on the instrumental set up.
Technology has also been available to measure such small distances, in
more than one way. Resonant bar detectors, pioneered by Joseph Weber in
the ’70s and still in use in the US and Italy, have achieved sub-nuclear dis-
placement sensitivities, even if not reaching their quantum limit (most are
limited by the noise in their transducers). These detectors consist of a large
resonant masses of meter scale in length, and 1-2 tons in mass, placed in
vacuum, at low temperatures, with very sensitive transducers to measure the
diﬀerential displacement of the ends of the mass. The measurements are most
sensitive near the resonance frequency bars, about a kHz.
The LIGO interferometric detectors, through very diﬀerent measurement
techniques than resonant bars, achieve similar precision for displacement
sensitivity, but over longer length scales (kilometers!), which then makes
for more sensitive detectors to strain, the natural measure of gravitational
wave strength. Interferometers are also most sensitive at lower frequencies
(∼100 Hz), and have a broader response, which makes for a better chance of
measuring signals from several other astrophysical sources, other than colli-
sions or explosions of stars.
2.1 The LIGO Detectors
The LIGO detectors [2] use interferometric techniques: they are essentially
Michelson interferometers that use coherent light and an optical readout to
deduce, from the interference of the beams returning from each arm, the

234

diﬀerence in arm length. In the famous Michelson-Morley experiment, such
interference would be caused by the diﬀerent light speed in each arm, presum-
ably aﬀected by ether. In a gravitational wave detector, the diﬀerence in arm
length would ideally be caused by the distance between the beamsplitter and
the mirrors at the ends of the arms being aﬀected diﬀerentially by a gravita-
tional wave. In the LIGO detectors, a coherent laser source is used (a NdYAF
laser with λ = 1064nm wavelength), and the signal detected at the antisym-
metric port is the power on a photodiode, measuring the phase diﬀerence
between beams that travel in the diﬀerent arms of the detector. The antisym-
metric port is kept “dark” with feedback controls, which push on the mirrors
to make the interference between the returning beams to be destructive. In
this case, the beams returning to the laser source have constructive interfer-
ence, making the whole detector behave like a mirror. In order to enhance
the signal, the light in each arm is stored in a Fabry-Perot optical resonant
cavity, using partially transmissive input mirrors; two more feedback loops are
needed to keep these cavities resonant. The circulating power in the detector
is increased by making another optical resonant cavity between the light re-
ﬂected by the detector, and a partially transmissive mirror at the input, or a
“recycling” mirror. A schematic drawing of the optical topology used in the
LIGO detectors is shown in Fig. 2.
In order to allow an approximation of free masses for the mirrors (and
to improve seismic isolation), the mirrors are suspended as pendulums by
single looping wires. The mirrors are cylindrical, made of fused silica, 25 cm
in diameter, 10cm thick, and 10 kg heavy. To avoid spurious phase diﬀerences
due to varying index of refraction, the light travels in vacuum beam tubes:
this is the largest volume high vacuum system in the world!
Of course, even in the absence of a gravitational wave, the signal at the
output is not identically zero: there is a certain amount of “noise” that will
then limit the magnitude of detected gravitational waves. The noise detected
will be the sum of several diﬀerent noise sources: some sources of noise make
the actual distance between mirrors change (like seismic noise and brownian
motion of the mirrors), and some sources of noise aﬀect the readout (like
shot noise of the laser light). The diﬀerent noise sources have each their own
spectral features, with diﬀerent power at diﬀerent frequencies: seismic noise is
largest at low frequencies, brownian motion is largest at the resonances of the
pendulum systems and the mirror masses, shot noise is largest at frequencies
above the optical cavity pole frequency (∼100 Hz). The resulting sum of all
the noise sources makes the detectors most sensitive at frequencies near 100-
200 Hz, but have a broad sensitive band between ∼50 Hz and a few kHz, as
shown in Fig. 3.
There are two 4km long LIGO detectors in the United States, one in the
LIGO Livingston Observatory, in the state of Louisiana, and another in the
LIGO Hanford Observatory, in the state of Washington; they are about 3000
km away. This will allow increased conﬁdence in an eventual detection, since
the false alarm rate is greatly reduced by requiring coincidence between the

detectors, within the maximum 10ms of light travel distance. In the LIGO
Hanford Observatory there is also an independent 2km long detector, which
again reduces the false alarm rate, and allows for a consistency check on
amplitude of a possible detection: since the gravitational wave produces a
change in distance proportional to distance, for a true signal, the measured
change in length in the 2km detector should be half as large as in the 4km
detector.
The LIGO detectors have improved their sensitivity since they were ﬁrst
turned on, as noise sources were identiﬁed and reduced or eliminated one by
one. Since 2002, the detectors reached signiﬁcantly better sensitivity than any
previous gravitational wave detector in its frequency band, and work in the
detectors was stopped four times to allow for data taking. These “Science
Runs” were called S1, S2, S3 and S4, and happened for 17, 61, 70, and 30
days respectively, starting in Aug 23 2002, Feb 14 2003, Oct 31 2003 and Feb
22 2005, also respectively. Not only the sensitivity, but also the duty cycle
improved in S4 with respect to previous runs, since an improved, active seismic
isolation system was installed in the LIGO Livingston Observatory to allow
daytime operations (the LIGO Hanford Observatory is more isolated from
human noise sources). In fall of 2005, the detectors achieved their designed
sensitivity, and starting taking data in continuous mode since November 2005
for an extended period of time, which will end when a year of coincident data
is obtained.
3 Astrophysical Sources of Gravitational Waves
There are several diﬀerent astrophysical sources of gravitational waves that
may produce signals in the LIGO detectors’ sensitive frequency band. Accord-
ing to their spectral content, we classify them in four groups: continuous sig-
nals from rotating stars; signals from binary systems; stochastic signals from
a cosmological background; and burst signals from collisions and explosions
of stars.
Rotating stars will produce gravitational waves if they are not perfectly
spherical, and have a mass quadrupole. The signal produced at the source is
monochromatic, with the frequency of the gravitational wave being twice the
rotation frequency of the star. There are many neutron stars in our Galaxy
that are pulsars, emitting radio waves that can be detected on Earth by radio
telescopes. From the detected radio signals, we know their position in the sky
and their rotational frequency. Some of these sources are also known to be
slowing down: they are “spinning” down. If we attribute the loss of energy to
the emission of gravitational waves, we obtain from the known spin derivative
an upper limit on the magnitude of the gravitational waves. With the LIGO
detectors, we can obtain a direct observational limit for the known pulsars,
since the predicted gravitational waves are in the detectors’ band. The data
is searched for a periodic signal with the appropriate Doppler shift for the

Gravitational Wave Detectors: A New Window to the Universe
237
star’s position in the sky and Earth’s rotation; in the absence of a signal,
an upper limit can be deduced on the strength of the gravitational waves
emitted by the source. This upper limit can also be translated into an upper
limit for the ellipticity of the star. With S2 LIGO data, 28 isolated radio
pulsars were studied, and limits were set in strain as low as few times 10−24
and in ellipticity of 10−5 [3]. The search for rotating stars at all positions
in the whole sky is computationally more challenging, and must be tackled
by diﬀerent techniques [4], or using shared resources. The American Physical
Society sponsored an exciting project, “Einstein@Home”, which uses people’s
idle computers to search for gravitational waves from rotating stars in LIGO
data.
The emission of gravitational waves from binary star systems is well un-
derstood as long as the objects are far enough away from each other for Post-
Newtionina approximations to apply: the signal emitted will have a frequency
equal to twice the orbital frequency, and will increase in frequency and am-
plitude as the system loses energy. Binary neutron star and small black holes
systems (< 20M⊙) will emit waves in the LIGO detectors’ band. We can in
fact translate a sensitivity curve into a distance at which we would detect
a binary neutron star system with average position in the sky and average
orientation, with a signal to noise larger than 8. The curves shown in Figure
3 correspond to a range of 80 kpc (S1), 1Mpc (S2) , 6.5 Mpc (S3), 8.4 Mpc
(S4) and 12 Mpc (S5). With optimal orientation and position in the sky, sys-
tems from distances up to 2.2 times farther away could be detected: in S5,
we are observing a fraction of the systems in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies.
The search in S2 data for neutron stars and black holes smaller than 1M⊙
resulted in no detections, and the ﬁrst direct upper limits on galactic and
extra-galactic systems [5, 6].
Looking for signals from violent events such as collisions of stars (the ﬁnal
stage of a binary system) or supernova explosions does not have models to use
in the search, so they rely on techniques looking for excess power in the data,
as measured by Fourier transforms, wavelet transforms, or other appropriate
methods. Searches for “bursts” in S2 data with frequency content in the 100-
1100 Hz data yielded no candidates. The sensitivity of this search, measured
in root-sum-square of the strain of possible waveforms, lies in the range of
h ∼10−20 −10−19/
√
Hz.
Sources of Gamma Ray Bursts are known to be supernova explosions, at
least for a large fraction of the “’long” bursts (more than two seconds long):
depending on the asymmetry of the mass distribution of the star and the
explosion, these sources can also originate gravitational waves in the LIGO
detectors’ frequency band. During one of the brightest Gamma Ray bursts,
GRB030329, the LIGO Hanford detectors were in operation, taking data for
the Second Science Run, and a dedicated search of the data at the time of the
Gamma Ray Burst yielded no detection, and an upper limit on the emitted
strain by an optimally polarized source of hrss ∼10−20 was obtained [8].

The superposition of many unresolved burst signals results in a continuous
random signal, or a “stochastic background”. These signals can be generated
by astrophysical sources such as the ones considered earlier, or to cosmological
processes, similar to the cosmic microwave background. Although the signal in
a single detector would be undistinguishable from other random noise sources,
the signal in a network of independent detectors can be detected by ﬁnding
correlated noise. The correlation will get weaker and eventually vanish for
signals with wavelengths shorter than the distance between the detectors. A
stochastic background can be characterized by a dimensionless function of
frequency Ωgw(f), the gravitational wave energy density per unit logarithmic
frequency, divided by the critical energy density to close the universe; if the
spectrum is ﬂat, the quantity Ωgw is a constant Ω0 independent of frequency.
The analysis of LIGO S3 data resulted in an upper limit Ω0 < 8.4 × 10−4 in
the frequency band between 60 Hz and 156 Hz [9].
4 Present and Future of Gravitational Wave
Astrophysics
Although there has not been any direct observation of gravitational waves yet,
the data being taken now with the LIGO detectors in the Fifth Science Run
that started in November 2005 shows enormous promise: even if no signal is
found, the observational upper limits on the strength of diﬀerent sources of
gravitational waves will be orders of magnitude better than previous published
results. The prediction for the rate of observation of signals from binary neu-
tron systems, extrapolated from the few known pulsar binary systems known
in the galaxy, is low enough so that no signal is expected in a year of operation
[10] (barring serendipity, never out of the question). However, extrapolations
from recent observations of short gamma ray burst implying an association
with the coalescence of compact binary systems [11], suggest that the rates,
especially for black holes, may be high enough to either expect direct ob-
servations in a year of data, or, in the absence of signals, to begin ruling
out some possible evolutionary astrophysical scenarios. A detector in Europe
built by the VIRGO French-Italian collaboration [12], with topology and sen-
sitivity similar to the LIGO detectors, may also begin operations in the near
future; the existence of a network with four detectors will not only lower the
frequency of possible false alarms, but also, in the case of detections, help
identify physical parameters of the source, such as polarization and location
in the sky.
The most exciting prospect, however, is that now that we know that the
basic technologies work in detectors of kilometer scale (a non trivial task!),
new and better technologies can be used to improve the sensitivity of the
LIGO detectors by about an order of magnitude. Since the reach in distance is
proportional to the sensitivity, the volume surveyed increases with the cube of
the sensitivity, and the rate of sources could be as much as 1,000 times higher

than in the present LIGO detectors. The predicted rate for such Advanced
LIGO detectors from binary neutron star systems extrapolated from galactic
systems [10] is a detection every few days! The Advanced LIGO detectors
could be operating at the beginning of the next decade. Even a few months
of observations will result in a signiﬁcant advance in our knowledge of the
Universe: a new window will be opened, and we cannot expect less than a few
surprises.

Summary. We describe the design of an extensive air shower detector array built
in the Campus of the University of Puebla (located at 19◦N, 90◦W, 800 gcm−2)
to measure the energy and arrival direction of primary cosmic rays with energies
around 1015 eV. The array consists of 18 liquid scintillator detectors (12 in the ﬁrst
stage) and 6 water Cherenkov detectors (one of 10 m2 cross section and ﬁve smaller
ones of 1.86 m2 cross section), distributed in a square grid with a detector spacing of
20 m over an area of 4000 m2. In this paper we discuss the calibration and stability
of the array, and discuss the capability of hybrid arrays, such as this one consisting
of water Cherenkov and liquid scintillator detectors, to allow a separation of the
electromagnetic and muon components of extensive air showers. This separation
plays an important role in the determination of the mass and identity of the primary
cosmic ray. This facility is also used to train students interested in the ﬁeld of cosmic
rays.
1 Introduction
The collisions of primary cosmic rays with nitrogen and oxygen nuclei high
in the Earth atmosphere give rise to extensive air showers (EAS).The latter
are composed of a large number of of secondary particles which penetrate the
atmosphere. EASs can be studied by measuring their particle densities as they
arrive at the ground by means of ground detectors or their particle densities
as they traverse the atmosphere by means of ﬂuorescence or Cherenkov light
telescopes on the ground.
EASs consist of four components depending on the type of secondary
particles: hadronic, electromagnetic, muonic and neutrino component; out of
these components only the electromagnetic and the muonic are detected with
ground detectors, because the hadronic components die away converting their
energy into the other components soon after the primary collisions take place.

In turn, the neutrino component is undetected because neutrinos interact only
weakly.
The energy spectrum of cosmic rays has been studied extensively by direct
measurements with detectors on balloons and satellites for the energy range
109 - 1014 eV, where their ﬂux is large enough to allow direct detections with
light-weight small-area detectors. For higher energies of the primaries, only
indirect measurements with detectors on the ground are possible due to the
small ﬂuxes involved, i.e., arrays of particle detectors on the ground or arrays
of telescopes that measure the ﬂux of ﬂuorescence or Cherenkov light produced
by the charged particles in the EAS as they interact with the atmosphere.
It has been found that the energy spectrum of primary cosmic rays is well
described by a power law, i.e., dE/dx ∼E−γ, over many decades of energy
with the spectral index γ approximately equal to 2.7, and steepening to γ = 3
at E = 3 × 1015 eV [1]. This structural feature is known as the “knee” of the
cosmic ray spectrum.
The nature of the knee is still a puzzle despite the fact that it was discov-
ered more than 46 years ago [2]. Most theories consider its origin as astrophys-
ical and relate it to the breakdown of the acceleration mechanisms of possible
sources within our galaxy or to a leakage during propagation of cosmic rays
in the magnetic ﬁelds within our galaxy; in particular, these theories lead to
the prediction of a primary composition richer in heavy elements around the
knee due to the decrease of galactic conﬁnement of cosmic rays with increasing
energy of the primary cosmic rays. Alternatively, there are scenarios where a
change in the hadronic interaction at the knee energy gives rise to new heavy
particles [3] which produce, upon decay, muons of higher energies than those
produced by normal hadrons.
The best handle to study the composition of primary cosmic rays by using
ground detector arrays is the measurement of the ratio of the muonic to the
electromagnetic component of EAS; in fact, Monte Carlo simulations show
that heavier primaries give rise to a bigger muon/EM ratio compared to lighter
primaries of the same energy [4]. In fact, evidence for such variations has been
reported recently [5].
The extensive air shower detector array at University of Puebla (EAS-
UAP) was designed to measure the lateral distribution and arrival direction of
secondary particles for EAS in the energy region of 1014−1016 eV. The special
location of the EAS-UAP array; 2200 m above sea level; and all the facilities
coming from the Campus of the University of Puebla make it a valuable
apparatus for the long term study of cosmic rays and at the same time an
important training center for new physics students interested in getting a ﬁrst
class education in the ﬁeld of cosmic rays in Mexico. In this paper we describe
the experimental setup of the EAS-UAP array and discuss the ability of arrays
like this one to measure the independent contributions of the muonic and EM
components of EASs.

2 Experimental Setup
The EAS-UAP array is located in the campus of the University of Puebla
in Mexico (UAP) at 19◦N, 89◦W and 800 gcm−2; it consists of 18 liquid
scintillator detectors distributed uniformly on a square grid with spacing of
20 m, and six water Cherenkov detectors (one of 10 m2 cross section and
ﬁve smaller ones of 1.86 m2), as shown in Fig. 1, where liquid scintillator
detectors are represented by black cylinders and water Cherenkov detectors
by stars (the bigger one is close to tl 6).
Each of the liquid scintillator detectors consists of a cylindrical container
of 1 m2 cross section made of polyethylene and ﬁlled with 130 l of liquid
scintillator up to a height of 13 cm. As sensor we use a 5” photomultiplier
(PMT) located inside each tank along the axis of the cylinder and facing down
with the photo-cathode 70 cm above the surface of the liquid scintillator. We
used commercial liquid scintillator manufactured by Bicron.
Out of a total of six water Cherenkov detectors, the array has one detector
bigger than the other ﬁve; it consists of a cylindrical tank made of roto-molded
polyethylene with a cross section of 10 m2 and a height of 1.5 m. This tank
is ﬁlled with puriﬁed water up to a height of 1.2 m and has three 8” PMTs
looking downwards at the tank volume from the water surface. The ﬁve smaller
water Cherenkov detectors consist of cylindrical tanks made of polyethylene
with an inner diameter of 1.54 m and a height of 1.30 m ﬁlled with with 2300 l
of puriﬁed water up to a height of 1.2 m.

2.1 Data Acquisition System
The trigger we use is ﬂexible enough, one of its options requires the coincidence
of signals from the four central liquid scintillator detectors (tl 1, tl 3, tl 7 and
tl 7) which form a rectangular sub-array with an area of 40 × 40 m2. This
trigger sub-array enhances the events in which the shower core falls inside this
sub-array. The measured trigger rate in this case is 80 events per hour. The
data acquisition system consists of a set of digital oscilloscopes that digitize
the signals from the PMTs of the liquid scintillator detectors and the water
Cherenkov detectors. All the digital oscilloscopes are connected to the GPIB
port of a PC in a daisy chain conﬁguration.
The system is controlled by the PC running a custom-made acquisition
program written in a graphical language called LabView [6]. We used com-
mercial NIM modules to discriminate the PMT signals at a threshold of -30
mV and to generate the coincidence trigger signal. The DAQ system acquires
all the PMT traces for each triggered event. The acquired traces are used by
the PC to perform on-line measurements of the integrated charges, arrival
times, amplitudes and widths of all signals the PMTs, these data are saved
into a hard-disk ﬁle for further oﬀ-line analysis.
2.2 Monitoring and Calibration
Single particle triggers are used simultaneously with EAS triggers for mon-
itoring the stability of the array and for obtaining the calibration constants
for each detector. We make use of the natural ﬂux of background muons and
electrons to monitor and calibrate our detectors.
Calibration of the detectors is essential as it allows the conversion of the
electronics signals measured in each detector into the number of particles in
the EAS that reach the detectors and ﬁnally into the energy of the primary
cosmic ray. For the location of the EAS-UAP, muons are the dominant contri-
bution to the ﬂux of secondary cosmic rays for energies above 100 MeV with
about 300 muons per second per m2 and a mean energy of 2 GeV; at lower
energies, up to 100 MeV, electrons dominate with a ﬂux 1000 times bigger
and a mean energy around 10 MeV [7].
It is important to keep in mind that a 2 GeV muon can cross the de-
tector (dE/dx ∼2MeV/cm) whereas a 10 MeV electron cannot; therefore
muons produce more Cherenkov light than lower energy electrons (the range
of 10 MeV electrons in a water-like liquid is about 5 cm). A vertical equiva-
lent muon (VEM)is the integrated charge on a PMT pulse as a consequence
of a vertical muon traversing the detector. Techniques to measure the values
of one VEM are reported elsewhere for water Cherenkov detectors [8] and
liquid scintillator detectors [9]. Thanks to these measurements we have a re-
liable way of converting the charge deposited in each detector into a number
of equivalent particles (electrons for liquid scintillator and muons for water
Cherenkov detectors) [10].

3 Performance of the EAS-UAP Detector Array
We have reported on the performance of the EAS-UAP array elsewhere [11,
12, 13]. The direction of the primary cosmic ray is inferred directly from the
relative arrival times of the shower front at the diﬀerent detectors. The core
position, lateral distribution function and total number of shower particles on
the ground Ne are reconstructed from a ﬁt of the measured electron-positron
densities to the NKG [14] expression
ρ(S, r) = K(S)( r
R0
)S−2(1 + r
R0
)S−4.5
(1)
where S is the shower age, r the distance of the detector to the shower core,
K(S) is a normalization constant and R0 is the Moliere radius (90 m for an
altitude of 2200 m a.s.l.) [15]. This ﬁt is done on an event-by-event basis. The
shower energy is obtained by using the following relation [16]
Ne(E0) = 117.8E1.1
0
(2)
where Ne is the total number of particles on the ground obtained by integrat-
ing Eq. (1) and E0 is the energy of the primary cosmic ray expressed in TeV
[15, 17].
Figure 2 shows a real event taken from the EAS-UAP event display and
Fig. 3 shows the measured particle densities and the ﬁtted lateral distribution
function for the same near-vertical shower. For this particular event, the num-
ber of electrons and positrons at the ground obtained by ﬁtting the data to
Eq. (1) were 174 600 and the reconstructed energy obtained by using Eq. (2)
was 459 TeV.
Given that our array is not uniform and therefore the center-of-gravity
method is not applicable to ﬁnd the position of the shower core on the ground,
we use the core position that provides the best ﬁt (i.e., with the ﬁt with a
minimum for χ2/dof) of the data data to the NKG formula given by Eq. (1).
We have tested that this procedure and the energy reconstruction method
work reasonably well for near-vertical MC showers by using Monte Carlo
showers generated with the MC shower generator called Aires [18].
4 Muon/EM Separation
Finally, we discuss a number of diﬀerent types of hybrid and composite ar-
rays and their capabilities to separate the electromagnetic from the muonic
component of EASs. As mentioned earlier, this separation constitutes the best
handle to study the mass and identity of the primary cosmic ray. Note that
this discussion represents work in progress and it is yet incomplete until the
eﬀect of photons, which are the dominant contribution among the particles in
EAS, is taken into account.

4.1 Water Cherenkov-Liquid Scintillator Hybrid Array
In the case of hybrid arrays such as EAS-UAP composed of two types of detec-
tors: water Cherenkov detectors with cross section AC and liquid scintillator
detectors of cross section AL the set of equations for the muonic (ρmuon) and
electromagnetic ρEM particle densities is the following:
QCherenkov
V EMC
= ρmuonAC + ρEMAC
24
(3)
QLiqScint
V EML
= ρmuonAL + ρEMAL
3
(4)
where QCherenkov and QLiqScint are the PMT charges collected in the Cherenkov
and liquid scintillator detectors, respectively; V EMC and V EML are the mea-
sured PMT charges that correspond to the detection of a vertical muon in the
Cherenkov and liquid scintillator detectors, respectively and the numbers 24
and 3 correspond to our explicit measurement that on the average a penetrat-
ing muon deposits 24 times more Cherenkov signal than a 10 MeV electron
in a 120 cm high water Cherenkov detector and 3 times more signal than a
10 MeV electron on a 13 cm high liquid scintillator detector [9].

This scheme for independently measuring ρmuon and ρEM is presently under
tests both at the EAS-UAP and through MC simulations.
4.2 Composite Array with Two Types Water Cherenkov Detectors
Similarly, if we place water Cherenkov tanks with ﬁlled with half the volume
of water, i.e., ﬁlled up to 0.60 m, side by side with fully ﬁlled tanks, i.e., ﬁlled
up to 1.2 m, we have in this case the set of equations:
QCherenkov
V EMC
= ρmuonAC + ρEMAC
24
(7)
Q′
Cherenkov
V EM ′
C
= ρmuonAC + ρEMAC

(10)
where QCherenkov and Q′
Cherenkov are the PMT charges collected in the water
Cherenkov tank ﬁlled up to 1.20 m of water and 0.60 m, respectively.
4.3 Non-Hybrid Array of Water Cherenkov Detectors
The relevant equation in this case is
QCherenkov
V EMC
= ρmuonAC + ρEMAC
24
(11)
One possible solution to accomplish muon-EM separation in this case makes
use of the fact that the lateral distribution functions for muons is steeper
than that for electrons and therefore it is possible to do a three-parameter ﬁt
to a modiﬁed-NKG function to obtain the number of muons, the number of
electrons and the shower age.
4.4 Use of Neural Networks
Another possibility is to use the diﬀerent temporal structure of the PMT
pulses in water Cherenkov detectors of bundles of EM particles (electrons,
positrons and photons) with respect to muons. We have studied this possibility
for a water Cherenkov detector with encouraging results [19].
5 Conclusions
We have discussed the importance of measuring the electromagnetic and
muonic components of extensive air showers to study the mass and iden-
tity of the primary cosmic ray. We have also described the EAS-UAP array
located in the campus of the University of Puebla, Mexico to study cosmic
rays around the knee of the spectrum and some ideas in which this array can
be used in a simple way to measure the relative contributions of muons in
near-vertical extensive air showers.

We present results from a search for GRBs in the energy range from tens of
GeVs to one TeV with an array of 6 water Cherenkov detectors located at 4500
m a.s.l. as part of the high mountain observatory of Sierra Negra (N18◦59.1,
W97◦18.76) near Puebla city in M´exico. The detectors consist of light-tight
cylindrical containers of 1 m2 cross section ﬁlled with 750 l of puriﬁed water;
they are spaced 25 m and have a 5” photomultiplier (EMI model 9030A)
facing down along the cylindrical axis. We describe preliminary experimental
results obtained by using a single-particle counting technique for a data taking
period of 58 days.
1 Introduction
Discovered by military satellites in the 60’s and more properly studied until
1991, when NASA launched the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO),
Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are probably the most energetic phenomena in
the Universe. As its name indicates, GRBs are gamma ray explosions that
can liberate up to 1053 ergs in about one second. In order to detect and study
GRBs, CGRO carried onboard 4 instruments: BATSE, EGRET, COMPTEL
and OSSE . These instruments were able to detect gamma-ray photons at
diﬀerent energy ranges; in particular, BATSE detected more than 2700 GRBs
with photon energies in the range from 20 KeV to 1 MeV. On the other hand,
7 GRB events were observed with photon energies greater than 30 MeV by
EGRET, with 6 of them with photon energies greater than 1 GeV. The event
named GRB940217 had the highest energy photon, 18 GeV [8].
It is important to mention that so far BATSE and EGRET have not ob-
served a cut-oﬀin the GRB energy spectrum; this suggests that the spectrum
may extend up to high energy components, with TeV photons, or even greater
as some models predict [5,13]. GRBs have been very well studied in the range
from KeV to MeV by the CGRO and BEPPO-Sax missions, however the high

energy component from GeV to TeV is still unknown. The GLAST mission
will be launched with this purpose next year.
In contrast, we are interested in detecting GRBs with energies in the 10
GeV to 1 TeV range using a ground-based detector array. This array is oper-
ating in a single-particle counting and coincidences modes. We describe this
water Cherenkov detector array located at the high mountain observatory of
Sierra Negra and we also describe the array’s capabilities in comparison with
other ground-based observatories.

tanks.
2 Ground-Based Experiments
Since gamma rays coming from outside the Earth cannot penetrate the at-
mosphere, it is necessary to use detectors on balloons or satellites to detect
them directly. In addition, as photon energies increase, the photon ﬂuxes de-
crease as a power law. Therefore, in order to detect small ﬂuxes of gamma
radiation or high energy photons in the range of GeV to TeV is necessary to
construct more sensitive detectors with larger areas. Satellite- borne detectors
with large collecting areas become impractical due to their cost. However, with
inexpensive ground-based experiments of large area, it is possible to detect
the relativistic secondary particles produced by the interaction of GeV or TeV
gamma-ray photons with the nuclei of the upper atmosphere.

Search for Gamma Ray Bursts at Sierra Negra, M´exico
255
Currently, there exists a handful of ground-based experiments around the
world searching GRBs: Chacaltaya at 5200 m a.s.l. in Bolivia [6]; Argo at
4300 m a.s.l. in Tibet [4], China; Milagro at 2630 m a.s.l. in New Mexico [10],
USA; the Pierre Auger Observatory at 1400 m a.s.l. in Malarg¨ue, Argentina
[1] and Sierra Negra at 4550 m a.s.l. in M´exico. Of all these experiments only
the prototype of Milagro called Milagrito has reported the possible detection
of signals associated to a GRB, GRB 970417 [2]. Milagro is the largest area
(60 m×80 m) water Cherenkov detector capable of continuously monitoring
the sky at energies between 250 GeV and 50 TeV. Although the Pierre Auger
Observatory was designed to study ultra high energy cosmic rays, it is also
a competitive high energy GRB ground-based detector due to its large area
and the good sensitivity to photons of its water Cherenkov detectors [1].
3 Sierra Negra Experiment
The high mountain array prototype of Sierra Negra is located near Puebla city,
M´exico, at 4550 m a.s.l. At present, the array consists of 3 cylindrical light-
tight water Cherenkov detectors located at the vertices of a 25 m side pentagon
and another detector will be shortly added 14 m away from an existing one
to allow the possibility to detect secondary particles in coincidence between
them. Each tank has a cross section of 1 m2. The tanks are ﬁlled with 750 l
of ultra-pure water (Fig. 1). The interior of each tank is covered with tyvek
and all of them contain a PMT to collect the Cherenkov light produced in the
water. The PMT signals are read out by a DAQ system that measures the
rates of secondary particles each tenth of second.
4 Sensitivity of Sierra Negra to GRBs
GRBs can be detected with ground-based detectors if the secondary particles
produced by their interactions with the atmosphere give rise to an excess in
the counting rate signiﬁcantly larger than the statistical ﬂuctuations of the
background rate. The method of counting every single particle that hits the
tank is known as single particle technique [12]. It is important to mention
that any observed counting excess due to GRBs should be temporally coin-
cident with a detection by one of the satellite experiments that observe a
common part of the sky, for example SWIFT [11]. In this way any other back-
ground processes that give rise to particle counting excesses are discarded. A
GRBs can be detected with a statistical signiﬁcance of n standard deviations
if Ns/σb > n [12], where Ns is the signal detected by the array. This signal
is proportional to the area and to the ﬂux of secondary particles; σb is the
background noise and it is proportional to the square root of all the secondary
particles produced by cosmic rays. In general, n is taken as 4.

detector response to muons and electrons. The deposited charge ratio from muons
and electrons is 41.7/3.5 =12, which is consistent with muon energies around 1 Gev
crossing 70 cm of water and electrons with energies around 10 Mev.
The background consisting of all the secondary particles produced by cos-
mic rays entering into the terrestrial atmosphere varies with altitude as shown
in Vernetto [12, Fig. 2 Left]. Then, for the altitude of Sierra Negra, the back-
ground rate of charge particles and photons is ≈1600 part m−2 s−1 and ≈4000
photons m−2 s−1 respectively. Knowing the background, we can calculate the
minimum ﬂux of particles detectable by an array of a given area, located at
a given altitude. It is assumed that the shower is originated by a GRB with
a total energy L = 1053 ergs and photons of E >1 GeV arriving vertically
to the detector array during 1 second. For Sierra Negra, we expect a min-
imum detectable ﬂux of secondary particles around 93 part m−2 s−1 for a
detector area of 3 m2. For Chacaltaya in Bolivia, which is the highest altitude
array at 5.2 Km a.s.l, the minimum detectable ﬂux is ≈26 particles m−2 s−1
considering an eﬀective area of 48 m2 and a background of ≈2100 particles
m−2 s−1.
The sensitivity increases strongly with the altitude of observation. Showers
generated by primary photons of the same energy increase the size (number
of secondary particles) with altitude. As an example, the mean number of
particles generated by a photon of 16 GeV at 5200 m is 1 while at 2000 m
(altitude of the EAS TOP experiment) is only 0.03, i.e., the sensitivity at
Chacaltaya is better even though its detecting area (48 m2) is considerable
smaller than that of EAS TOP (350 m2). The Sierra Negra array is sensi-
ble to GRBs of energies E < 200 GeV with the present detectors using the
single-particle technique which is represents our ﬁrst approach to detecting
GRBs.

On the other hand, due to the geographic coordinates of Sierra Negra (N
18◦59.1, W 97◦18.76), we have the advantage of the almost zenithal transit of
the Crab Nebula everyday. The Crab Nebula is a constant source of gamma
rays that can be used as a standard candle for calibration [7]. Therefore, in
Sierra Negra we have the possibility to detect it by using a simple method
based on the rate of coincidences or showers detected by the array. First of
all, we need to know the photon ﬂux expected from the Crab Nebula when it
is located at the zenith of Sierra Negra. Assuming that the source is observed
during 4 hours everyday (±30◦from the zenith) with 3 detectors in the vertices
of a triangle that covers 300 m2 of area. And knowing the Crab Nebula ﬂux,
f = 2.68 × 10−7E−2.59 photons m−2 s−1 TeV −1 [2, 3], we obtain a ﬂux of
one photon per day. In other words, we expect to detect one shower per day
coming from the Crab Nebula. On the other hand, from the coincidence data
of the Sierra Negra array, we are presently detecting around 160 showers per
minute (Fig. 3, Right). This means that if we are able to discriminate the 95%
of the muonic component in the showers, and to detect 50% of the photons
and reduce the uncertainty in the ﬁeld of view to ±20 (corresponding to 16
minutes of Crab Nebula observation), we expect to detect the Crab Nebula
with a signiﬁcance of 5 in less than 6 months!
Fig. 3. (Left) .- Coincidence rate/0.1 sec for the three water Cherenkov detectors
with a separation of 14 m. (Right).- In a period of 30 minutes we had about 160
showers per minute.
However, in order to achieve this goal, we need to be able to discriminate
out the muonic component. The right plot of Fig. 2. shows that with a water
Cherenkov detector and a fast digitization system we can indeed achieve a
separation of the muon component from the electromagnetic one. Further
steps planned will optimize the single-particle technique of detection with
higher levels of coincidence triggers and a better shower reconstruction. It
is worth mentioning that the Crab Nebula has already been detected at high

energies by ground-based experiments such as Milagro, located in New Mexico,
USA (2630 m a.s.l.) and ARGO, located in the Tibet, China (4300 m a.s.l.).
5 Data Analysis and Results
The data were taken from 3 water Cherenkov detectors operating in Sierra
Negra, Puebla, M´exico. The background rate measured in 0.1 s intervals ver-
sus time for each tank is not constant as shown in Fig. 4. The variations in the
background rate are mainly due to two factors: the outdoor temperature and
the atmospheric pressure, eventually solar activity may also be detectable [9].
Although, we have few atmospheric data at the site of Sierra Negra, we found
that the background rates measured with each detector are correlated with
temperature and pressure (Fig. 4). However, the time scale of these modula-
tions is much larger than the typical time duration of GRBs and therefore they
do not aﬀect our GRB search. In addition, during night time the background
rate of the 3 detectors is much more stable.
Figures 5 and 6 show the particle rate versus time and the particle rate
distribution for each tank. The standard deviation and the mean rate of the
ﬁtted Gaussian for tank 1 is 20 part m−2/0.1s and 206 part m−2 /0.1s. For
tank 2 these parameters are 11 part m−2/0.1s and 104 part m−2 /0.1s re-
spectively. The coincidence rate/0.1s for the two closer detectors is shown in
Fig. 3 Left. The measured background rate in tanks 1 and 3 is about a fac-
tor of 1.3 greater than that predicted by Vernetto [12] for the Sierra Negra
altitude (about 1600 part m−2 s−1). Out of the total background [12], ap-
proximately 41% corresponds to the electromagnetic component (electrons,
positrons and photons), 33% corresponds to the muon component and all the
rest is due to the hadronic component. It is also observed that at low altitude
places, <3.5 Km, the muon component is dominant while at higher altitudes
the electromagnetic component is dominant (Fig. 2 Left). According to our
data, 4 standard deviations corresponds to 800 part m−2 s−1, then a GRB will
be detected if it shows a counting rate excess of at least this number of single
particles. Notice that this ﬂux of secondary particles is above the theoretical
minimum ﬂux detected by Sierra Negra array (93 part m−2 s−1).
6 Conclusions
From the analysis of data and theoretical calculation, we expect that with a
simple array at high altitude and a good method to discriminate the muonic
component in the extended air showers we will be able to detect the Crab
Nebula in less than 6 months. In addition, GRBs that produce a total energy
above 1053 erg with photon energies E > 1 GeV are also within the detection
reach capabilities of Sierra Negra.

time the background rate is stable for all the detectors. The slight increase in the
background rate of tank 3 is well correlated with measured changes in temperature
and pressure.

almost the same, about 207 part m2/0.1s. while tank 2 shows a mean value of 104
part/m2/0.1s. The typical dispersion rms/mean was lower than 9%.

Basic aspects of strange quark matter (cold quark matter composed of roughly
equal numbers of up, down and strange quarks) and the possible capture
by the Earth’s magnetosphere of the population of strangelets (hypothetical
stable lumps of strange matter) are discussed to gauge the prospects for their
detection.
1 Strange Matter and Strangelets
As an alternative to normal nuclei, strange matter (i.e. cold catalyzed quark
matter composed of roughly equal numbers of u, d and s quarks) has been
conjectured to be the ground state of hadronic matter (see [1, 2, 3]). The
speculation on which this hypothesis has been based is that there is a gain
in energy for converting some of the u and d quarks into s quarks in the
soup by weak interactions which may be larger than the energy loss due to
the ﬁnite s quark mass. Simple physical models [4] have shown that this is
not unreasonable for a range of bagged QCD parameters. Since these initial
works, a large number of papers have appeared devoted to the physics and
astrophysics of strange matter (see the Proceedings of SQM Workshop for
references and Madsen [5] for an update). Small chunks of strange matter
having a low baryon number have been termed “strangelets”. Roughly speak-
ing, strangelets can be further divided into two broad classes depending on
their baryon number. For A ∼100 it has been shown that shell eﬀects at the
quark level are very important and mainly determine the properties of the
states. When A ≥100 the shell eﬀects are less important and the states can
be described by a liquid drop model in which a surface correction and so-called
curvature terms are included in addition to the bulk volumetric terms in the
free energy. Since for several parameter sets E/Astrangelet ≤930 MeV, they

are candidates for stable baryonic particles and may be produced in a variety
of astrophysical environments.
Some cosmic rays (hereafter CR) events have been tentatively identiﬁed
with primary strangelets in the past. However, no conﬁrmation of these candi-
dates has emerged and the identiﬁcation of new ones has proved to be elusive.
It is fair to say that strangelets are at most a rare component of CR. Of par-
ticular interest is the question of astrophysical mechanisms of production and
the total mass present in the galaxy [6, 7].
If present among CR primaries, an alternative place to look for strangelets
may be the Earth’s magnetosphere, where analogously to the well-known
trapped radiation belts [8], a geomagnetically trapped strangelet belt could
be present and amenable to direct measurements. This hypothesis has been
made several years ago [9] and recently revisited by us. Several key issues in
strangelet phiscs and radiation belt physics must be addressed to evaluate the
actual existence of a trapped strangelet component. Such calculations would
also help to design and analyze the experiments to detect this component. It
is the purpose of this work to discuss some of these questions in the follow-
ing sections. Section 2 is devoted to discuss the state-of-the-art of strangelet
physics. In Section 3 we address the expected trapped component features.
Section 4 presents our ﬁrst conclusions.
2 Strangelet Physics
Finite lumps of strange matter (strangelets) have been investigated by several
authors using a spherical MIT bag model approach. For small A ≤100 the
mass (or energy per baryon) calculated by explicit mode-ﬁlling [4, 5, 10].

where the subindex f stands for the u, d and s ﬂavors, k labels the order of
the eigenfuntions corresponding to the Dirac solutions for a cavity of radius
R and B is the MIT parametrization of the false vacuum energy. Due to
ﬁnite mass of the s quark, the ﬁlling of the levels is quite cumbersome with
increasing number of quarks and the strangelet “magic numbers” are not easily
predicted. Moreover, the states are strongly degenerate around a minimum
energy. Since many of a given set of those states are stable with respect to
strong interactions and also long-lived because weak decays are Pauli-blocked,
they may jointly contribute to laboratory experiments. However ,when dealing
with catalyzed astrophysical stangelets, a single state for a given A will be
selected. As a general feature, mode-ﬁlling calculations show that the charge
Z of the most stable strangelet is ≪A (see, for example [11]). Generally
speaking, the presence of A ≤100 “magic” strangelets is very dependent on
the bulk limit energy per baryon of strange matter ϵb. If ϵb −mn is small, the

265
small strangelets are metastable at most, a result which has been explained in
terms of the free energy expansion [12]. On the other hand, for ϵb −mn ≃tens
of MeV, absolutely stable small strangelets exist and are interesting in CR
research. It has been shown [12] that small strangelets are strongly disfavored
energetically and, unless shell eﬀects dominate [13] they should not be stable
at all.
A further complication of this picture is the (very interesting) possible
existence of attractive interaction among quarks generating a paired state
instead of a pure, uncorrelated Fermi liquid. The best studied case is the
so-called CFL (color-ﬂavor locked), which was investigated in both the bulk
limit [14] and strangelet [12] limits. In both cases the pairing interaction was
found to enlarge substantially the parameter space for stability.
With these caveats in mind we adopt the charge-to-mass ratio for both
(“normal” and “CFL” strangelets) found from a ﬁtting of the exact calcula-
tions
Z = 0.1 A ,
Z = 0.3 A2/3 ,
(2)
in which we have ﬁxed the mass of the s quark to a ﬁducial value ms =
150 MeV.
Once A ≥100 the strangelets are not critically dependent on shell ﬁll-
ing and can be described by a free-energy expansion around the bulk limit
including surface (∝R2) and curvature (∝R) corrections. One unusual fea-
ture of strangelets physics is that the curvature term largely dominates the
surface one, a result due to relativistic nature of adopted MIT model conﬁned
to a cavity, but believed to be more general than this. The curvature term
is clearly less important as A (and therefore R) grows. For strangelets in the
A ≥100 regime (which may be important since several proposed candidates in
CR [15] belong to it), a Thomas-Fermi analysis [16] renders a charge-to-mass
relationship

for a strange quark mass ms = 80 MeV (this should be compared with the
Farhi and Jaﬀe work [4], where Debye screening has not been taken into ac-
count). For even larger strangelets A > 104 the charge-to-mass ratio becomes
Z ∝A2/3, but since the ﬂux of these massive species is expected reasonably
to be a rapidly decreasing function of A in the cosmic ﬂux, and in any case
the particles would be very diﬃcult to brake and trap, we need not worry
about this regime for our purposes. The theoretical relations eqs. (2) will be
the basis for our calculations.
3 Features of a Strangelet Belt
The features of the Earth’s radiation belts have been reviewed by a number
of authors [8]. The basic equation of charged particle motion was derived

266

by St¨ormer at the beginning of the century when he solved the problem of
determining the allowed and forbidden regions of the sky for a particle of
momentum p coming from inﬁnity to reach an observer at a given latitude λ,
this condition reads
sin θ =
2γ
r cos λ −cos λ
r2
(4)
where θ is the angle between p and the meridian plane, r = (qM/pc)1/2 is the
St¨ormer variable with M the Earth’s magnetic moment and q the charge of
the particle, and 2γ is the impact parameter. Trapped (or closed) trajectories
follow from the condition sin θ ≤1. The actual relevance of St¨ormer’s theory
was recognized in the ‘60s after the discovery of radiation belts by Van Allen
and collaborators. The discrimination between the inner (mainly protons)
and outer (electrons) belts become clear after the Pioneer spacecraft ﬂights
and prompted several theoretical and experimental studies of these particle
families.
Another important landmark in the study of magnetospheric particles was
the discovery of trapped anomalous cosmic rays by Chan and Price [17] in the
data taken onboard the Skylab and reviewed by Biswas et al. [18]. The origin
and features of this trapped component was immediately addressed in several
works and received deﬁnitive conﬁrmation in a successive series of experiments
(see [18] for a list of references). More recent data by SAMPEX (see [19] and
references therein) has shown the consistency of several measured features
with the suggested single-ionized, interplanetary ACR origin [20].
The important questions to be addressed about the hypothesis of strange-
lets being trapped analogously to ACR are the trapping conditions, their
lifetime in the belt and the expected ﬂuxes.
The simplest possibility is that the trapping mechanism discussed by Blake
and Friesen [20] for anomalous cosmic ray nuclei (hereafter ACR) applies to
the trapping of strangelets. According to these authors, the high mass-to-
charge ratio of singly-ionized ACRs enables them to penetrate deeply into
the magnetosphere. ACRs with trajectories near a low altitude mirror point
interact with particles in the upper atmosphere, losing one or all their remain-
ing electrons. Immediately after stripping, the particle gyroradius is reduced
by a factor of 1/Z, and the ion can become stably trapped. Since low A
strangelets are expected to have already lost all their surrounding electrons
due to interactions in the ISM, they will only be trapped if they already meet
the Blake-Friesen conditions when fully ionized. The latter depend on the
so-called “adiabaticity” parameter (ϵ), deﬁned by Blake and Friesen as
ϵ = 0.049 (A/Z) L2 [γ2 −1]1/2
(5)
where γ is the Lorentz factor of the particle. The parameter ϵ determines the
maximum L-shell that allows stable trapping for a given particle, as charac-
terized by the values of A, Z and momentum, or alternatively, the maximum
A for a given L-shell and momentum, indicating, as already expected, that
particles with high A and/or high p can not be stably trapped.

Are There Strangelets Trapped by the Geomagnetic Field?
267
Direct observations of L-shell distribution [21] suggest that ions with ϵ <
1/10 (and a suitable pitch angle) at the time of stripping would be stably
trapped (fulﬁlling the requirements for triply −adiabatic motion).
For a particle to penetrate up to a certain region in the magnetosphere,
its energy must be enough to overcome the local geomagnetic cutoﬀrigidity,
a condition that can be written as
Rparticle >
59.6 cos4 λ
L2[1 + (1 −cos γ cos3 λ)1/2]2
GV

(6)
where λ is the latitude and γ the arrival direction of the particle (East - West).
When considering charged particles trapped in a magnetic ﬁeld their mo-
tion may be thought as the composition of three diﬀerent motions: the bounc-
ing motion of a guiding center along the magnetic ﬁeld line; the rotational
motion of the particle itself around that guiding center; and the longitudinal
drift of the guiding center. In this way, an important condition intimately
related to the validity of the guiding center approximation is that the mag-
netic ﬁeld intensity must vary very slowly along a cyclotron orbit, imposing a
maximum energy allowed for stable trapping in these conditions
p⊥
qB ≪
B
∇⊥B .
(7)
Figure 1 shows graphically these constraints for CFL strangelets for a ﬁxed
value L = 2 in addition to the minimum baryon number which is required
for strangelet stability [5]. The value adopted has been Amin = 30 and may
be trivially altered for any other threshold.
The constraint (7) has been enforced to a 10% conﬁdence level, and the as-
sumption E⊥∼E, which means we are actually underestimating the number
of particles that could be stably trapped in the geomagnetic ﬁeld.
It is easy to understand that the conditions enforced by the Blake and
Friesen model of trapping are much more restrictive for strangelets than for
anomalous cosmic rays, mainly because their large inertia and small charge.
In this way, if strangelets are a component of the ACR belt there should be a
mechanism other than the Blake and Friesen one responsible for populating
this region of the magnetosphere (the curves for normal strangelets, not shown
in this work, lead to the same conclusion). Alternatively, the trapping may
be still achieved, although not conserving the triple-adiabatic invariants. This
case is much more complicated and the trajectories and other features must
be found by numerical integration.
Additional considerations are relevant for the fate of a trapped population
of strangelets. It is well-known that the solar wind has a strong inﬂuence on the
ACR ﬂux upon the Earth. The most abundant ACR heavy ion, oxygen, shows
a strong intensity variation with the solar cycle, having its interstellar ﬂux of
8-27 MeV/nucleon lowered up to two orders of magnitude during periods of
solar maximum activity [18].

and λ = 45o (lower),where ﬁeld lines at L = 2 penetrate the earth surface in the
dipole model.
Solar modulation would only act signiﬁcantly on low-baryon number, low-
energy strangelets. It could, however, have a measurable inﬂuence since the
strangelet ﬂux decreases towards higher values of baryon number and rigidity
but probably not as important as the inﬂuence detected for ACR’s. Therefore,
the search for trapped strangelets in the geomagnetic ﬁeld should be more
successful if performed during the solar maximum activity whether they are an
important component of the radiation belt or are to be measured penetrating
the atmosphere towards to surface of the Earth due to reduced component of
ACR.
4 Conclusions
We have analyzed here the possible trapping of non-relativistic strangelets
with A <
∼102 already ionized by collisions with electrons in the ISM. A trap-
ping mechanism similar to the one proposed by Blake and Freisen for ACRs
can not work for the exotic strangelets, which display a very low charge-to-
mass ratio. If strangelets are a component of the anomalous cosmic ray belt
at L ∼2, a more suitable mechanism must be found. These exotic baryons
could in principle be detectable in the Earth magnetosphere whether stably
trapped in a radiation belt (particularly during the period of maximum solar

269
activity) or merely passing though the atmosphere, perhaps being captured
and trapped in non-adiabatic conditions. We do not have yet ﬁrm estimates,
which may require considerable numerical work. Independently of this pro-
posal, ground-based methods and heavy ion collisions are still good sites for
strangelet searches. The detection of those particles having low Z/A ratio (like
the candidate presented in [22]) would be very important for determining the
properties of cold, dense baryonic matter.

We show for the ﬁrst time the evolution of non-spherically symmetric balls of a
self-gravitating scalar ﬁeld in the Newtonian regime. In order to do so, we use
a ﬁnite diﬀerencing approximation of the Shcr¨odinger-Poisson (SP) system of
equations with axial symmetry in cylindrical coordinates. Our results indicate
that spherically symmetric equilibrium conﬁgurations of the SP system are
late-time attractors for non-spherically symmetric initial proﬁles of the scalar
ﬁeld, which is a generalization of such behavior for spherically symmetric
initial proﬁles. Our system and the boundary conditions used, work as a model
of scalar ﬁeld dark matter collapse after the turnaround point. In such case, we
have found that spherically symmetric halos are late time attractor solutions
of possible axisymmetric initial scalar ﬁeld overdensities.
1 Introduction
Recently, scalar ﬁelds have played the role in several scenarios related to as-
trophysical phenomena. The reason is that such ﬁelds are quite common in
theoretical physics, specially branches related to theories beyond the standard
model of particles, higher dimensional theories and brane world models of the
universe. In the present research we deal with the scalar ﬁeld dark matter
model (SFDM), which assumes the dark matter to be a classical minimally
coupled real scalar ﬁeld determined by a cosh-like potential. Such potential
provides the ﬁeld with the necessary properties to mimic the behavior and
successes of cold dark matter at cosmic scales. In fact in [1, 2, 3] it was shown
that the mass parameter of the scalar ﬁeld gets ﬁxed by a desired cut-oﬀof
the power spectrum, which has two eﬀects: i) the theory gets ﬁxed and ii)
there is no overabundance of substructure, which standard cold dark matter
cannot achieve. One important consequence is that the boson has to be ultra-
light with masses around m ∼10−21,−23eV. This is a substantially important

bound, because in the standard dark matter models there are no such ultra-
light dark matter candidates. The beneﬁt obtained however, is two fold: the
scalar ﬁeld can represent a Bose Condensate of such ultralight particles and
the de Broglie wavelength forbids the scalar ﬁeld to form cuspy structures.
After the ﬂuctuation analysis about this candidate and its correspond-
ing concordance with observations -the model mimics the properties of the
ΛCDM at cosmic scales-, the next step has to be in the direction of the study
of structure formation and the explanation of local phenomena, like rotation
curves in galaxies. Fortunately there have been important advances in such
direction [4, 5]. In [6] it was shown that relativistic self-gravitating scalar
ﬁeld conﬁgurations can be formed when they have galactic masses provided
the mass of the boson is ultralight. Nevertheless, because the gravitational
ﬁeld in galaxies is weak, the race turned into the newtonian limit of the sys-
tem of equations, which was developed in [7]. The price to be paid is that
it is not possible to apply the approach at very early stages of the evolution
of the universe, and the proﬁt is that the scalar ﬁeld in the non-relativistic
regime provides a clear interpretation within the Bose Condensate formal-
ism and classical quantum mechanics. In both cases, the strong gravity and
the Newtonian regimes, a wide range of arbitrary spherically symmetric ini-
tial conﬁgurations collapse and form gravitationally bounded and virialized
objects with a smooth density everywhere (except those that are related to
unstable initial conﬁgurations that collapse into black holes in the strong ﬁeld
regime) [8, 9]. This property seems to be fundamental in order to form galactic
halos, because several high resolution observations are consistent with regular
galactic dark matter proﬁles in the center of the galaxies [10, 11, 12, 13].
It is clear then, that two approaches are in progress, both are comple-
mentary and are useful to explore the SFDM hypothesis. Turning back to
the astrophysical scenario, at stages after the turnaround point where weak
ﬁeld applies, the question is whether dark matter halos are gravitationally
bounded objects of scalar ﬁeld which have been formed through a gravita-
tional collapse of initial scalar ﬁeld overdensities. The newtonian version of
the Einstein-Klein-Gordon system of equations is provided by the Schr¨odinger-
Poisson equations (SP), which are the ones that lead the gravitational collapse
of the system. This approximation should work for the evolution of an initial
density proﬁle after the epoch when the overdensity ﬂuctuation starts to evolve
independently of the cosmological expansion.
In the recent past, it has been found that in spherical symmetry the SP
system has stationary solutions, from which only the nodeless one is stable
[8, 14]; even further, it has been found that such conﬁgurations behave as
late-time attractors for initially quite arbitrary spherically symmetric den-
sity proﬁles [7, 15]. The goal of the present manuscript is to show that such
attractor behavior extends beyond spherical symmetry, still within axially
symmetric initial density proﬁles.
In the next section we present the code to solve the axially symmetric
SP system and enumerate the physical quantities that characterize the axial

conﬁgurations. In order to provide testbeds of our code, in section 2 we show
the evolution of spherically symmetric equilibrium conﬁgurations, which be-
havior is well known; latter in the same section we show the evolution of
non equilibrium axial symmetric conﬁgurations and the attractor behavior of
the spherically symmetric ground states. Finally in section 3 we draw some
comments and conclusions.
2 Numerical Evolution of Axially Symmetric Initial
Proﬁles
In order to solve the SP system with axial symmetry we developed a code that
uses cylindrical coordinates (x, z). The scalar ﬁeld Φ is of the form Φ = Φ(x, z)
and the SP system in such coordinates reads
i∂Φ
∂t = −1

∂2Φ
∂x2 + 1

∂Φ
∂x + ∂2Φ
∂z2

+ UΦ
(1)
∂2U
∂x2 + 1
x
∂U
∂x + ∂2U
∂z2 = Φ∗Φ
where U is the gravitational potential due to the presence of Φ. Notice that we
are using units in which c = ℏ= 1 and the associated mass of the scalar ﬁeld
has been normalized to one. The way we solve the whole system is as follows:
given an initial scalar ﬁeld proﬁle, the evolution process consist in solving
Poisson’s equation using centered ﬁnite diﬀerencing, then, once U is known
the Schr¨odinger equation is solved using a second order accurate explicit time
integrator, then we use such new wave function to solve Poisson’s equation
and repeat.
The term containing the 1/x factor deserves special attention; it happens
that when r →0 such term does not converge (when it does not in fact
diverge) with second order. In order achieve second order convergence at such
point we have staggered the grid in the x direction and used the discretized
version 2
dΦ

∂Φ
∂x and 2 dU
d(x2) instead of
1
x
∂U
∂x , where
d
d(x2) is a
derivative with respect to x2.
Another important issue has to do with the boundary conditions. We as-
sume the system is physically open, however Schr¨odinger equation is far from
being the wave equation and no sommerfeld boundary conditions can be ap-
plied as far as we are aware. However we emulate open boundaries by applying
fully reﬂecting boundary conditions and implementing a sponge region in the
outermost grid points of the domain. The sponge consists in adding in such a
region an imaginary potential to the Schr¨odinger equation, whose eﬀects are
those of a sink of density of probability. Thus the particles near the boundaries
are trapped by the sponge. Details about the implementation of the sponge
for spherical symmetry can be found in [8], and we just implemented the same
idea in a two dimensional domain.

Because we are dealing with a classical quantum mechanical system, it
is possible to calculate expectation values of physical operators. Among the
important quantities we want to monitor are: the density of probability ρ =
ΦΦ∗, the mass of the conﬁguration M =
(
ρd3x, the expectation value of the
kinetic K = −(1/2)
(
Φ∗∇2(Φ)d3x, potential W = (1/2)
(
ρUd3x and total
E = K + W energies. The number of particles allows us to calculate the
material content in a region of space. The expression 2K + W determines
whether the system is dynamically virialized or not; we say that the system is
nearly virialized when 2K + W ∼0; it is fair to say that because the systems
we deal with are intrinsically perturbed due to discretization errors (discrete
approximation of the equations), the relation will never be strictly equal to
zero and we only demand that it converges to zero with second order in the
continuum limit.
2.1 Tests of the Code
As a testbed for the code, it is necessary to verify whether in these non-
spherical coordinates the code is able to reproduce the expected results for
an equilibrium conﬁguration, that is, a spherically symmetric stationary solu-
tion. In spherical symmetry, in order to construct stationary conﬁgurations the
scalar ﬁeld is assumed to have the form Φ = e−iσtφ(x); provided the bound-
ary conditions φ = 0 at inﬁnity and demanding the gravitational potential to
be smooth at the origin, the SP system becomes an eigenvalue problem. The
eigenvalues σ related to the eigenfunctions Φ are non degenerate and take a
diﬀerent values for diﬀerent central ﬁeld φ(0). Because the time dependence
of Φ is harmonic, ρ = ΦΦ∗and therefore the gravitational potential U should
be time independent. Another property of the equilibrium conﬁgurations con-
structed in this way is the number of nodes of the wave function; the solution
with a nodeless wave function is said to be in the ground state and it has been
shown (see [8]) that only the ground state solutions are stable. In fact a linear
perturbation analysis has revealed that such ground state systems oscillate
with a speciﬁc angular frequency when slightly perturbed, a property that
is quite useful when dealing with the discretized version of the SP equations.
Another important property of the system (1) is the following scale invariance:
{t, x, U, Φ} →{λ−2ˆt, λ−1ˆx, λ2 ˆU, λ2 ˆΦ}
(2)
{ρ, M, K, W} →{λ4ˆρ, λ ˆ
M, λ3 ˆK, λ3 ˆW}
(3)
where λ is a scaling parameter. Property (2-3) implies that if a solution is
found for a given central ﬁeld value ˆφ(0) = ˆφ0 (e.g. ˆφ(0) = 1) it is possible
to build the whole branch of equilibrium conﬁgurations. For instance, if the
plot M vs φ(0) is to be constructed, we know from [8] that for ˆΦ(0) = 1 we
have ˆ
M = 2.0622; using the relations (2-3) for Φ and M we ﬁnd λ =

Φ(0) for all central values of the scalar ﬁeld. This function is used later
on when showing the attractor behavior of these equilibrium conﬁgurations.
Therefore, without lost of generality we tested this code by evolving the
particular ground state equilibrium conﬁguration with φ(0) = 1.0; in practice
we construct initial data for this particular central ﬁeld value in spherical co-
ordinates and interpolate the value of Φ and U into our xz−plane. We know
from the construction of these solutions that the density and the gravitational
potential are time independent. However, as happens to the virial theorem,
both the density and the potential are slightly time-dependent due to the
discretization error that is present at all times during the evolution of the
system. The eﬀect of such an error is a perturbation that can be analyzed
through linear perturbation theory; in fact it was found in [8] that for the
present system the central density of the system should oscillate with a fre-
quency γ ∼0.046. Then, a test consists in demanding that the central density
actually oscillates with this frequency within our axisymmetric code, and that
the central density converges to the correct value in the continuum limit, that
is ρ(t, 0, 0) = |Φ(t, 0, 0)|2 = 1. In Figure 1 we show both results. The virial re-
lation is also convergent to zero in the continuum limit. These results indicate
that we are obtaining the expected results for an equilibrium conﬁguration.

resolutions ∆xz = 0.2 and ∆xz = 0.1, ρ0.2 and ρ0.1 respectively; ρ0.2 has been

order convergence of the value 1. Right: The Fourier Transform of the central density
shows its main peak -which is associated to the fundamental mode frequency of the
system- at γ ∼0.046 (see text for details). These plots, together with the convergence
of the virial relation indicate that our code works properly.
2.2 Evolution of Non Spherical Initial Proﬁles
In this section we show that spherically symmetric ground states, are late
time attractors for initial conﬁgurations which are not spherically symmetric.

A ﬁrst step would be to show that equilibrium conﬁgurations are stable against
axisymmetric perturbations, and a second step would be to show how quite
arbitrary axisymmetric initial data evolve toward a spherical equilibrium con-
ﬁguration. We decided to skip the ﬁrst step and go straight to the second one.
We carried out a series of simulations with initial data consisting of the su-
perposition of an equilibrium conﬁguration with φ(0) = 1 and a gaussian-like
proﬁle given by the expression δψ = Ae[−x2/σ2
x−z2/σ2
z] that we call invading
proﬁle. The parameters of the invading proﬁle for the cases shown here corre-
spond to σx = 1 and σz = 1.5, with amplitudes A = 0.1, 0.2, which implies an
addition of 5% and 9% of the total mass of the original equilibrium conﬁgu-
ration. The reason to proceed in such way is that beyond the perturbation of
the system we wonder whether the invading particles attach to the spherical
conﬁguration and together they evolve toward a rescaled equilibrium conﬁg-
uration.
The result is that the whole system evolves toward a stationary conﬁgura-
tion through the gravitational cooling process [8, 15], which is powered by the
ejection of a small amount of scalar ﬁeld mass of 0.05% and 0.12% respectively.
In the left panel of Figure 2, we show the evolution of the mass M versus the
central density ρc = ρ(x = 0, z = 0) for both initial proﬁles. The solid line
is the branch of all the equilibrium conﬁgurations constructed as described
above. What can be observed in the plot is that the initial conﬁgurations
oscillate around the branch of equilibrium conﬁgurations and at late times it
tends to converge to one of such solutions. This attractor behavior has been
shown for spherically symmetric conﬁgurations in [15] and is shown here for
the ﬁrst time for the case of non-spherical proﬁles. However, the information
related to the convergence to an equilibrium conﬁguration is not enough, and
in the right panel of Figure 2 we show the ellipticity of the system, which
we deﬁne as the integrated diﬀerence between ρz = ρ(0, z) and ρx = ρ(x, 0)
measured from the center of mass of the conﬁguration; we can see that after
a transient with initial ellipticity the system relaxes and becomes spherical in
the continuum limit.
3 Conclusions
We have presented a new code that solves the SP system of equations with
axial symmetry using ﬁnite diﬀerencing and an explicit time integrator. We
tested our code with the evolution of an equilibrium spherically symmetric
ground state conﬁguration, and obtained the correct values of the fundamental
frequency of perturbations due to the discretization errors; in fact we showed
that such error is spherical and no axisymmetric modes are excited through
the discretization of the SP equations in cylindrical coordinates. Moreover we
veriﬁed that the virial state of such system behaves in the expected way in
the continuum limit.

Fig. 2. Evolution of two axially symmetric initial data made of an equilibrium
conﬁguration plus a non-spherical gaussian like proﬁle. Left: we show that the initial
axially symmetric conﬁgurations evolve toward spherical equilibrium conﬁgurations
(points in the solid line) through the emission of scalar ﬁeld. Right: the ellipticity is
shown for both simulations. Bottom: we show the value of the expression 2K + W;
as it oscillates around zero with a decreasing amplitude we conclude that the system
tends to a virialized state.
Using such code we evolved non-spherically symmetric conﬁgurations made
with the superposition of an equilibrium conﬁguration and a gaussian-like ax-
ially symmetric proﬁle. The gaussian-like proﬁle was more than just a pertur-
bation, because the amount of matter added to the equilibrium system was of
the same order of its mass; therefore we actually tracked the evolution of an
axially symmetric initial proﬁle. We showed that at late times, the conﬁgura-
tions tend toward an equilibrium spherical ground state solution. This result
suggests a late time attractor behavior of spherical ground states for axisym-
metric initial scalar ﬁeld density proﬁles, which would be a generalization of
such behavior for spherically symmetric proﬁles.

278
Argelia Bernal and F. Siddhartha Guzm´an
In the context of the scalar ﬁeld dark matter model we have quite a new
result: the collapse of overdensities tolerates an initial non-sphericity of the
proﬁles, and moreover, initially axisymmetric proﬁles tend toward a spherical
ground state.

We study interacting dark energy (DE) and cold dark matter (DM) in the con-
text of an inhomogeneous and anisotropic spacetime. DM and DE are modeled
as an interactive mixture of inhomogeneous dust (DM) and a generic homoge-
neous dark energy (DE) ﬂuid. By choosing an “equation of state” linking the
energy density (µ) and pressure (p) of the DE ﬂuid, as well as a free function
governing the radial dependence, the models become fully determinate and can
be applied to known speciﬁc DE sources, such as quintessense scalar ﬁelds or
tachyonic ﬂuids. For the case of the simple equation of state p = (γ −1) µ
with 0 ≤γ < 2/3, the free parameters and boundary conditions can be se-
lected for an adequate description of a local DM overdensity evolving in a
suitable cosmic background that accurately ﬁts current observational data. If
the particular case when DE ﬂuid corresponds to a quintessense scalar ﬁeld,
the interaction term can be associated with a well motivated non–minimal
coupling to the DM component. The eﬀects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy
yield diﬀerent local behavior and evolution rates for observational parameters
in the local overdense region.
1 Introduction
Observational data on Type Ia supernovae strongly suggests that the universe
is expanding at an accelerated rate [1, 2]. This eﬀect has lead to the wide-
spread assumption that the inventory of cosmic matter–energy could contain,
besides baryons, photons, neutrinos and cold dark matter (DM)3, an extra
contribution generically known as “dark energy” (DE), whose kinematic ef-
fect could be equivalent to that of a ﬂuid with negative pressure. While the
large scale dynamics of the main cosmic sources (DE and DM) is more or
3 We shall assume henceforth that DM is of the “cold” variety, i.e. CDM.

less understood, their fundamental physical nature is still a matter for de-
bate, thus various physical explanations have been suggested. Cold DM is
usually conceived as a collisionless gas of supersymmetric particles (neutrali-
nos), while DE can be modeled as a “cosmological constant”, quintessense
scalar ﬁelds, tachyonic ﬂuids, generalized forces, etc [3, 4]. The standard ap-
proach is mostly to consider a Friedman-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)
metric, with linear perturbations, making also the simplest assumption that
DE only interacts gravitationally with DM. However, there are still some un-
resolved issues, such as the so–called “coincidence problem”, concerning the
odd apparent fact that the critical densities of DM and DE approximately
coincide in our cosmic era [5, 6]. Aiming at a solution to this problem and
bearing in mind our ignorance on the fundamental physics of DM and DE,
various models have been proposed recently which include assorted forms of
interaction between these sources [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
It is customarily assumed that DE dominates large scale cosmic dynamics,
so that DM inhomogeneities in galactic clusters and superclusters can be
considered a local eﬀect or can be treated by means of linear perturbations
in a FLRW background. Thus, a reasonable generalization of existing models
could be to assume inhomogeneous DM interacting with homogeneous DE,
so that large scale dynamics is governed by the latter. We propose in this
paper a class of analytic models which provide a reasonable description of
inhomogeneous DM interacting with a generic homogeneous DE source. The
models are based on the decomposition of a perfect ﬂuid tensor as a mixture
of an inhomogeneous dust component (DM) plus a homogeneous perfect ﬂuid
with negative pressure (generic DE), as the matter source of the spherically
symmetric subcase of the Szafron–Szekeres exact solutions of Einstein’s ﬁeld
equations [12]. However, the underlying geometry of the models we present
can be easily generalized to include non–spherical symmetries or even the case
without any isometry, since Szafron–Szekeres solutions do not usually admit
Killing vectors.
The decomposition of a perfect ﬂuid tensor as a mixture of an inhomo-
geneous dust component plus a homogeneous ﬂuid has been considered pre-
viously [13, 14] but in the context of mixtures of baryons and radiation. We
consider in this paper only the type of models examined in [14], by assum-
ing the homogeneous ﬂuid to describe a generic DE source, while the dust
component corresponds to inhomogeneous DM, all of which is a reasonable
assumption since the dynamical eﬀects of quintessence mostly become domi-
nant in very large scales, larger than the “homogeneity scale” (100–300 Mpc),
while DM (galactic clusters and superclusters) is very inhomogeneous at scales
of this magnitude and smaller.
In order to determine the time evolution of the sources, we need to as-
sume a physical model, or “equation of state” for the generic DE source (the
homogeneous ﬂuid). Thus, we assume in section VIII a simple “gamma law”
equation of state of the form p = (γ −1) µ, where p, µ are the pressure and
matter–energy density of the DE source. Such an equation of state leads to a

DE homogeneous ﬂuid evolving like a FLRW ﬂuid with ﬂat spacelike sections
with a scaling law of the form µ ∝t−2, which is compatible with a scalar ﬁeld
with an exponential potential [15]. Although this is a very simple type of DE
source, it yields analytic forms for the DM density, observational parameters
and all other relevant physical and geometric quantities.
The assumption of a gamma law equation of state fully determines the
time dependence of all relevant quantities, while the spacial dependence is
determined once we select an arbitrary function whose form depends on the
choice of suitable boundary conditions associated with a description of a local
DM overdense region in a DE dominated cosmic background that accurately
complies with observational constraints on observational parameters: Ωfor
DM and for DE and the deceleration parameter q. We provide a full graphical
illustration of the interplay between “local” and “cosmic background” eﬀects
on these observational parameters: for example, anisotropy emerges in the
local dependence of these quantities on the “oﬀ-center observation angle” ψ
(Figure 2), while inhomogeneity leads to local conditions in the overdense
region (DM dominates over DE and q is positive) that are diﬀerent from
those of the cosmic background: DE dominates and q < 0, as required by an
“accelerated” universe whose large scale dynamics is dominated by a repulsive
force associated with DE (Figures 3).
The issue of the interaction between DE and DM is dealt with in section
VI. We show that the individual momentum–energy tensors for DM and DE
are not independently conserved, thus the models are incompatible with these
components interacting only gravitationally. However, if we assume the DE
ﬂuid to be a scalar ﬁeld quintessense type of source, then the models can
accommodate various prescriptions for a DE–DM interaction, like those pro-
posed in the literature [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Finally, in section VII we present a
discussion and summary of our results. The results presented in here have
been further generalized and expanded in [16].

So far, the homogeneous DE ﬂuid with µ, p is a generic form of DE. Once
we choose an “equation of state” p = p(µ), corresponding to a speciﬁc DE
model for this ﬂuid (for example, a scalar ﬁeld), we can ﬁnd H by integrating
(4) and (5), and then a and T by integrating (6) and (7). Once H and T have
been determined, we can obtain the DM density ρ for a given choice of the
arbitrary function f(r). This free function represents the freedom to choose
an initial DM density proﬁle along a given surface of constant t.
Other important quantities are the expansion kinematic scalar Θ = ua ;a

The metric (1) looks like a FLRW line element modiﬁed by the terms con-
taining T, F and f. In fact, all r–dependent variables derived above reduce
to their FLRW forms: ρ = σ = 0, Θ/3 = H, if these “perturbations” vanish,
i.e. if either T = 0 or f = f ′ = 0. This homogeneous subcase is a FLRW
spacetime whose source is the DE perfect ﬂuid with matter–energy density
and pressure given by µ and p. In a sense, if f T ≪1 and F T ≪1 the

models would correspond formally to speciﬁc exact perturbations of FLRW
cosmologies.
Notice that the form of the two equations (4) and (5) is identical to the ﬁeld
equations of a FLRW spacetime with ﬂat space sections and matter source
with µ, p. This suggest that we identify µ, p, a and H with variables somehow
associated with a FLRW background. In fact, the function f can be suitably
selected so that such a background can be identiﬁed with conditions r →∞
along surfaces of constant t. We must stress, though, that the correct inter-
pretation of physical and observational quantities must be given in terms of
tensorial quantities like (9-10) characteristic of the inhomogeneous spacetime
(1-8).
3 Observational Parameters
The quantity H in (7) is the Hubble expansion factor associated with a FLRW
geometry, for the inhomogeneous metric (1) the proper generalization of this
parameter is given by [17, 18]
H = Θ
3 + σab nanb,
(11)
where the vector na complies with nana = 1, uana = 0. For a spherically
symmetric spacetime, it is necessary to evaluate na for general comoving ob-
servers located in an “oﬀ–center” position in the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ)
centered at r = 0. For the metric (1) equation (11) becomes in general
H = H + F ˙T ,
F = 2 [f (1 + F T) + 3

(12)
where ψ is “observation angle” between the direction of a light ray and the
“radial” direction for a fundamental observer located in (r, θ, ϕ) [18]. There-

Hence the free function f must be suitably chosen so that the large scale
spatial dependence of the observational parameters (11), (13), (13) and (14)
ﬁts these bounds. However, these restrictions can be strongly relaxed, at a
local level, if we examine the spatial variation of local values of DM density
and observational parameters in scales smaller than the homogeneity scale
∼100−300 Mpc.
A convenient choice for the asymptotic behavior of f as r →∞is to choose
it monotonously decreasing in r so that
f →f ∗,
F →f ∗,
as

(16)
where f ∗is a positive constant. This yields Σ∞= 0 so that [σa b]∞= 0 and

The choice (27) is well suited to examine a large scale (supercluster scale or
larger) spherical inhomogeneity whose evolution requires that we somehow
“plug in” the eﬀects of a cosmological background, while the asymptotic be-
havior f →0 as r →∞(case f ∗= 0) may be preferable for a relatively small
scale and/or large density contrast description of an homogeneity (cluster of
galaxies) that ignores cosmic eﬀects.
4 A Simple Example: The “Gamma Law”
In order to illustrate how to work out the expressions we have derived, we
consider now the simple case of a homogeneous DE ﬂuid satisfying a simple
equation of state known as the “gamma–law”
p = (γ −1) µ,
(19)
where γ is a constant. The dust plus homogeneous ﬂuid mixtures that we
are studying were examined previously [13], assuming (among other choices)

Inhomogeneous Dark Matter in Non-trivial Interaction with Dark Energy
285
this equation of state, but placing especial emphasis in a dust and radiation
(γ = 4/3) mixture. Since our emphasis is now on modeling DE sources, we
will assume 0 < γ < 2/3, so that −1 < p/µ < −1/3. In this case we have from
(4), (5), (6) and (7)

where H0 = 100 km/(sec Mpc), h = 0.7 and T ∗is a dimensionless constant
denoting the asymptotic value of T (we have then in (6) the choice c0 = 3
2 γ h).
Notice that the assumptions (20-22) have been obtained from the FLRW
equations (4) and (5) and yield a power law form for the function a (equivalent
to the FLRW scale factor). Therefore, following [15], this form of the homo-
geneous DE ﬂuid is equivalent to a scalar ﬁeld with an exponential potential
following the so–called “scaling law”.
The density of the dust component and the generalized Hubble factor are
found by inserting (20-22) into (8) and (12)

From (20-22), we see that R scales as tk, so that k > 1/3 for γ < 2, hence
using (21) and (24) and assuming an arbitrary but ﬁnite f and F, we obtain

indicating that for all cosmic observers the mixture homogenizes and
isotropizes as the homogeneous DE ﬂuid dominates asymptotically over the
cold DM component.
5 Numerical Exploration
Having found T, H and a = R/R0 for the particular case of a gamma law (19),
we only need to select the function f = f(r) in order to render the models
fully determinate. A convenient form for f is

286
Roberto A. Sussman, Israel Quiros and Osmel Mart´ın Gonz´alez
f = f ∗+
δ
1 + r2 ,
(27)
where δ > 0 so that f(0) = f ∗+ δ > f ∗. Notice also that asymptotically as
r →∞, we have: M →r if f ∗= 0 and M →r3 if f ∗> 0.
The regularity of models requires ρ, √grr, √gθθ to be non–negative, but
√grr = 0 must not occur in all the range in which √gθθ > 0. The regular
evolution range for the models is the coordinate range (τ, r) for which this
condition holds with a, H, T given by (19-22) and f, F given by (8) and (27).
Thus, the coordinate surface 1 + fT = 0 marks a non–simultaneous initial
central singularity or “big–bang”, we can take then the big bang time as the
value τ = τbb at this surface corresponding to r →∞, that is:
τ 1/γ1
bb
=
γ1 (f ∗+ δ)
1 + (f ∗+ δ) T ∗
(28)
Thus, considering the “age of the universe” roughly as ∆t0 ≈14 Gys and
h ≈0.7, the present cosmic era corresponds to
τ0 = τbb + 3
2γ h H0 ∆t0 ≈τbb + 3.17 γ
(29)
Since the big bang surface √gθθ = 0 is not simultaneous, for any hypersurface
τ = constant, the regions near the center at r = 0 will be “younger” than
those asymptotically far at large values of r.
The parameter δ = f(c) −f ∗> 0 in (27) provides a measure of inhomo-
geneity contrast, or “spatial” variation of all quantities along the rest frames
(t = constant) between the symmetry center r = 0 and r →∞. Thus, a
suﬃciently large/small value of δ makes the values at r = 0 and r →∞
suﬃciently close/far to each other, thus indicating small/large “contrast” or
degree of inhomogeneity.
The appropriate numerical value for the asymptotic constant, f ∗, can be
found by demanding that the cosmological observational parameters ΩDE,
ΩDM, q, evaluated in the cosmic background (r →∞) at the present era (τ =
τ0), take (for a given γ) reasonably close values to those currently accepted
from observational data. Since (25) with T ∗= 0 and f given by (27), evaluated
at τ = τ0 and r →∞, is independent of δ and ψ, we can plot ΩDE, ΩDM, q as
functions of f ∗and γ. As Figures 1a, 1b and 1c illustrate, the desired value
of f ∗for any given γ can be selected so that the forms (13), (13) and (14) at
τ = τ0 and r →∞yield:
0.6 < ΩDE < 0.7,
0.3 < ΩDM < 0.4,
−0.5 < q < −0.4 .
(30)
In particular, if we select γ = 0.15, an appropriate value is f ∗≈100, leading
to ΩDE ≈0.64, ΩDM ≈0.35 and q ≈−0.5. Notice that ΩDE+ΩDM ≈1, but the
present Omega for DM would be slightly higher than the currently accepted
value ΩDM ≈0.3. Thus, we could argue that these parameter values would

The asymptotic value of f is given by
f ∗. Assuming T ∗= 0 and an arbitrary δ, we
can ﬁnd a suitable value for f ∗, for any given γ,
by demanding that the observational parameters
ΩDE, ΩDM, q (panels (a),(b) and (c)) have appro-
priate “present” cosmological values as r →∞
for τ = τ0 (gray stripes). Each curve is marked
by a given value of γ. Notice that for γ = 0.15,
the choice f ∗≈100 yields ΩDE = 0.64, ΩDM =
0.35, q = −1/2, which are reasonably close to cur-
rently accepted observational data. For γ closer to
0 (cosmological constant), we would have to select
larger values for f ∗, while larger γ close to 0.3 cor-
respond to f ∗∼1.
become a very accurate approximation to actually inferred cosmological pa-
rameters if we would consider ρ as the compound density of DM and baryonic
matter.
The eﬀects of anisotropy emerge in the dependence of H, as given by (25),
on the oﬀ–center “observation angle” ψ. This implies dependence on ψ for
ΩDE, ΩDM, q. Considering the free parameter values
T ∗= 0,
f ∗= 100,
δ = 200,
γ = 0.15,
(31)
complying with the cosmic background ranges (30-30), Figure 2 displays ΩDE
and ΩDM, evaluated at τ = τ0, as a function of log10 r for assorted ﬁxed values
of ψ. The same proﬁles of ΩDE and ΩDM occur for ψ = 0 and ψ = π (thick
black lines) and, in general for any two values of ψ that diﬀer by a phase
of π, with the highest “peaks” corresponding to gray curves with ψ = π/2
and ψ = (3/2)π. This singles out two “preferential” distinctive directions:

the dependence of the proﬁles of ΩDE and
ΩDM, along τ = τ0, on the oﬀ–center “obser-
vation” angle ψ. The thick black curves cor-
respond to ψ = 0, π, while the gray curves
provide the proﬁles of ΩDE and ΩDM for var-
ious other values of ψ. In particular, the
larger “peaks” of these parameters occur for
ψ = π/2, 3π/2 and around r ∼1. Notice
how these eﬀects of anisotropy are negligi-
ble in the overdensity region around r = 0
and in the cosmic background for large r.

fects are negligible for all r.
one along the axis ψ = 0, π and the other along ψ = π/2, (3/2)π. This is a
clear representation of a quadrupole pattern, as expected for a geodesic but
shearing 4-velocity [17, 18]. Also, as revealed by Figure 2, the curves for the
various ψ diﬀer from each other only in the transition region near r ∼1, thus
the eﬀects of this quadrupole anisotropy are negligible near the center of the
local overdensity and in the cosmic background asymptotic region.
The eﬀects of inhomogeneity are illustrated by Figures 3a, 3b and 3c,
displaying ΩDE, ΩDM and q as functions of τ and log10 r for ψ = 0, π and
using the free parameters (31). It is particularly interesting to remark how as
τ grows we have:
ΩDE →1, ΩDM →0 and q →−1/2 for all r, as expected
for a DE dominated asymptotically future scenario and associated with an
ever accelerating universe that follows a “repulsive” dynamics. However, in
the present cosmic era (thick black curve) this repulsive accelerated dynamics
on which ΩDE dominates and q < 0 only happens in the cosmic background
region, with ΩDM > ΩDE and q > 0 (i.e. “attractive” dynamics) in the local
overdensity region with a relatively large DM density contrast δ = 200.
Conditions (15) and (15) place stringent limits on large scale deviations
from homogeneity and anisotropy, but these bounds do not apply to local
values of these quantities. If we plot these quantities (see [16]) for the cases
depicted in the previous ﬁgures, all characterized by (19), (20-22), (27) and
(31), and even considering the relatively large value δ = 200, condition (15)
holds throughout most of the coordinate range (τ, r) including the far range
“cosmological background” region of large r and the local overdensity region
near the symmetry center r = 0, so that for the present cosmic time τ = τ0
it only excludes the relatively small scale local region around r ∼1 that
marks the “transition” from the local overdensity to the cosmic background.
However, a choice like δ = 0.01 would yield similar level curves, but with
values three orders of magnitude smaller, thus denoting a state of almost
global homogeneity, since (15) would hold in almost all local scales in τ = τ0.
A graph that is qualitatively very similar emerges for condition (15).

on τ and r (panels (a), (b) and (c)) for ψ = 0.
The thick black curves denote the hypersurface
of present cosmic time τ = τ0. The ﬁgures clearly
show the diﬀerences among the overdense re-
gion around r = 0, the cosmic background for
large r and the transition zone between them
around r ∼1. As in the previous ﬁgure, it is
evident that DE dominates over DM in the cos-
mic background, but DM dominates over DE in
the center, with both converging as τ →∞to
asymptotically homogeneous states with values
ΩDE →1, ΩDM →0. Notice in (c) how the de-
celeration parameter, q, is negative in the cosmic
background (accelerating universe), but is posi-
tive in the overdense region where the dynamics
of local gravity should not be repulsive.
This diﬀerence between the dynamics of local inhomogeneities and that of
the cosmic background cannot be appreciated in such a striking and spectac-
ular way if one examines DE and DM sources by means of the usual FLRW
models and their linear perturbations.
6 Interaction Between the Mixture Components
As we mentioned before, the two mixture components: DM (inhomogeneous
dust) plus DE (homogeneous ﬂuid) are not separately conserved. Considering
(9) and (10), the energy balance for the total energy–momentum tensor, ˙e +
(e + p) Θ = 0,
can be written in terms of the DM and DE components as

290
Roberto A. Sussman, Israel Quiros and Osmel Mart´ın Gonz´alez
Since each term in square brackets in the left hand side of (32) corresponds to
the energy balance of each mixture component alone, a self–consistent form
for describing the interaction between the latter is given by
˙µ + (µ + p)

3 H + Z ˙T

= −Q,
˙ρ + ρ

3 H + Z ˙T

= Q,
(33)
where Q = Q(t, r) is the interaction term. Since the physics behind DM
and DE remains so far unknown, we cannot rule out the existence of such
interaction. Notice that once a given model has been determined by specifying
an “equation of state” p = p(µ) and a form for f = f(r), as we have done
in the previous sections, this interaction term would also be fully determined.
In general, if the interaction term in (33-33) is a negative valued function,
then DM transfers energy into the DE and viceversa. Considering the free
parameters given by (19), (27) and (31), we plot in Figure 4 the interaction
term Q in (33-33), as a function of τ and log10 r. Notice that Q is initially
positive and remains so today (DE transfers energy to DM at τ = τ0) but
will change sign in a future time (DM transfers energy to DE), tending to
zero asymptotically as τ →∞. The time–asymptotic state is that of only
gravitational interaction between DE and DM (i.e. separate conservation of
each component).
However, the relevant question is not so much the explicit functional form
of Q, but its interpretation in terms of a self–consistent physical theory that
would be regulating the interaction between DM and DE. In fact, one of the
challenges of modern cosmology is to propose such a self–consistent theoretical
model of this interaction, while agreeing at the same time with the experimen-
tal and observational data. In this context, the interaction between DM and
DE has been considered, using homogeneous FLRW cosmologies, in trying
to understand the so–called “coincidence problem”, that is, the suspiciously
coincidental fact the DE and DM energy densities are of the same order of
magnitude in our present cosmic era [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].
If the homogeneous DE ﬂuid corresponds to a quintessense scalar ﬁeld,
φ = φ(t), with self-interaction potential V (φ), we have instead of (19):
µ =
˙φ2
2 + V (φ),
p =
˙φ2
2 −V (φ).
(34)
In this case, the interaction term in (33-33) can be associated with a well
motivated non–minimal coupling to the DM component. Consider a scalar-
tensor theory of gravity, where the matter degrees of freedom and the scalar
ﬁeld are coupled in the action through the scalar-tensor metric χ(φ)−1gab[21]:

Therefore, once we determine a given model, so that Q can be explicitly
computed, we can use (37) to ﬁnd the coupling function χ that allows us to
relate the underlying interaction with the theoretical framework associated
with the action (35).
For the models under consideration, we can integrate (in general) the
constraint (37) with the help of (1), (4-6), (8), (9), (36) and using Θ =
(d/dt) [ln(Y 2 Y ′)]. This yields

where ξ(r) is an arbitrary function that emerges as a constant of integration.
Notice that the models require φ = φ(t), so that the assumption χ = χ(φ)
implies χ = χ(t). However, from (38), we have in general χ = χ(t, r), with
the case χ = χ(t) occurring for the following particular cases, associated with
very special forms of f and ξ
F = 0,
f ∝r−3/2,
ξ ∝r−1/2, ⇒χ−1/2 ∝H,
(39)
f + F = 0,
f ∝r−3,
ξ ∝r4, ⇒χ−1/2 ∝

(40)
or, if F ̸= 0 and f+F ̸= 0, then f and ξ must be obtained from the constraints:

.
(41)
However, since (39-40) and (41) yield very special forms of f, ξ and of χ, we
prefer to apply (35) under the most general assumption that the coupling
function χ should be a function of φ and of position, i.e. χ = χ(φ(t), r), as
given by (38) for suitable forms of the free functions f, H and T (thus, φ and
V (φ)), hence ξ can be considered a wholly arbitrary free function.
However, we should point out that relating the interaction term, Q, to
the formalism represented by (35) is strictly based on the formal similitude
between the ﬁeld equations derived from the action (35), on the one hand,
and equations (33-33) and (34), on the other. Also, the interaction between
DM and DE in the context of (35) is severely constrained by experimental
tests in the solar system [20]. A more detailed and careful examination of the
relation between χ and φ that incorporates properly these points, as well as
the application of (35) to the models presented here, will be undertaken in
future papers (see also [16]).

7 Conclusion
We have presented a class of inhomogeneous cosmological models whose source
is an interacting mixture of DM (dust) and a generic DE ﬂuid. The relevance
of the present paper emerges when we realize that there are surprisingly few
studies in which DE and DM are the sources of inhomogeneous and anisotropic
spacetimes (see [22]), as practically all study of the dynamical evolution of
these components is carried on in the context of homogeneous and isotropic
FLRW cosmologies or linear perturbations on a FLRW background. There
are also very few papers that examine the possibility of non–gravitational
interaction between DE and DM.
Once we assume or prescribe an “equation of state” (i.e. a relation between
pressure, p, and matter–energy density, µ, of the DE ﬂuid), we have a speciﬁc
DE model (quintessense scalar ﬁelds, tachyonic ﬂuid, etc) and all the time–
dependent parameters can be determined by solving diﬀerential equations
reminiscent of FLRW ﬂuids. Since the spatial dependence of all quantities
is governed by the function f = f(r), once the latter is selected the mod-
els become fully determined. In order to work out this process we chose the
simple “gamma law” equation of state: p = (γ −1)µ (equation (19)), leading
to analytic forms for all relevant quantities, including the main observational
parameters, ΩDE, ΩDM and q. Our choice for a DE ﬂuid complying with (19)
is equivalent to a scalar ﬁeld with exponential potential, satisfying a scaling
power law dependence on t [15]. Although this is a very idealized quintessense
model, our aim has been to use it as a guideline to illustrate how more so-
phisticated DE scenarios can be incorporated in future work involving the
models.
As shown in Figures 3, the models homogenize and isotropize asymptoti-
cally in cosmic time for all fundamental observers and/or assumptions on the
DE ﬂuid, thus they are well suited for studying the interaction between DE
and DM in the context of the evolution of large scale inhomogeneities (of the
order of the scale of homogeneity ∼100 −300 Mpc). By selecting appropriate

Inhomogeneous Dark Matter in Non-trivial Interaction with Dark Energy
293
boundary conditions (form of f), we can examine inhomogeneities at various
scales and/or asymptotic conditions (see Figures 2 and 3). In particular, we
have explored the case of a local DM overdense region, whose scale can be ar-
bitrarily ﬁxed and with an asymptotic behavior that accurately converges to
a cosmic background characterized by observational parameters that ﬁt cur-
rently accepted observational constraints: 0.6 < ΩDE < 0.8, 0.2 < ΩDM < 0.4
and q ≈−0.5 (see Figure 4). As illustrated by the various graphical examples
that we have presented, this interplay between a local overdensity, a cosmic
background and a transition region between them, shows in a spectacular
manner how inhomogeneity and anisotropy lead to interesting and important
information that cannot be appreciated in models based on FLRW metrics
and/or linear perturbations. For example, as revealed by Figure 2, the eﬀect
of anisotropy emerges as a dependence of observational parameters on local
observation angles in “oﬀcenter positions”, an eﬀect which is only signiﬁcant
in the transition between the overdensity and the cosmic background. On the
other hand, as shown by Figures 3, inhomogeneity allows for radically diﬀer-
ent ratios between DM and DE in the overdensity and the cosmic background,
so that DM dominates over DE, locally, in the overdense region, as a contrast
with DE dominating DM, asymptotically, in the cosmic background (as ex-
pected). Also, while q is negative in the cosmic (DE dominated) background,
thus denoting the expected “repulsive” accelerated expansion at large scales,
we have q > 0 along smaller scales in the local overdensity. For all parameters
there is a smooth convergence between local and asymptotic values in the
transition region.
We have also examined the non–gravitational interaction between DE and
DM. Plotting the interaction term, Q, (Figure 4) shows that energy ﬂows from
DE to DM at the present cosmic era, with the ﬂow reversing direction in the
future and evolving towards an asymptotic future state characterized by pure
gravitational interaction: Q →0. If we take the DE ﬂuid to be a quintessense
scalar ﬁeld, the DE vs DM interaction can be incorporated to the theoretical
framework of an action like (35), associated with a non–minimal coupling of
scalar ﬁelds and DM. Since DM is inhomogeneous while the scalar ﬁeld is
homogeneous, only for some particular forms of spacial dependence (i.e. the
function f) we obtain a coupling function expressible as χ = χ(φ). In gen-
eral, we have to allow for the possibility that χ = χ(φ(t), r). However, we
have examined this interaction just in qualitative terms, with the purpose of
illustrating the methodology to follow in future applications. As guidelines for
future work, we have the application of the models to more sophisticated and
better motivated DE formalisms, perhaps in the context of the “coincidence”
problem [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. See [16] for a more comprehensive version of
this article.

Our aim in this review is to brieﬂy describe the main results in the topic of
scalar ﬁeld dark matter, in which a scalar ﬁeld is the dark matter particle.
We will start with a revision of the concept of scalar ﬁelds at the classical
and quantum levels. We will then continue with some of the relevant solu-
tions for self-gravitating scalar ﬁelds in a cosmological setting. At the end, we
will discuss the constraints cosmological observations impose upon the free
parameters of a scalar ﬁeld dark matter model.
1 What is a Scalar Field?
The properties of any system are given by its Lagrangian, and for a classical
scalar ﬁeld φ(t, x) minimally coupled to gravity is given by [1, 2, 3]
Lφ = −√−g
1
2∂µφ∂µφ + V (φ)

,
(1)
where V (φ) is called the scalar potential, and encodes in itself all of the scalar
ﬁeld self-interactions. We shall assume that the scalar ﬁeld lives in a curved
spacetime which is described by the metric gµν with signature (−1, 1, 1, 1)
(our units are such that c = 1), and g = det(gµν).
The equation of motion for the scalar ﬁeld, also known as the Klein-Gordon
(KG) equation, arises from the Euler-Lagrange equations, and then is of the
form
2φ = −dV (φ)
dφ
,
(2)
where we identify the (covariant) d’Alembertian operator 2 ≡(1/√g)∂µ
(√−g∂µ).
The scalar potential V (φ) depends on the kind of scalar system we would
like to describe. The simplest choice is the free scalar ﬁeld potential 1, V (φ) =

tion, in the following manner. If the free particle version of the latter appears from

(1/2)m2φ2, where m is called the mass of the scalar ﬁeld2. For simplicity, we
will work out the free case only, as it will help us to illustrate the properties
of a scalar ﬁeld in a cosmological setting.
1.1 Quantization of a Free Scalar Field
The accepted interpretation of scalar ﬁelds is that their excitations, once we
quantize them, represent particle states so that the single-particle interpreta-
tion of the wave function φ should be abandoned. In this section, we brieﬂy
describe the quantization of scalar ﬁelds, (for details see [1, 2, 3]).
To begin with, we consider the (ﬂat) Minkowski spacetime in which gµν =
ηµν ≡diag(−1, 1, 1, 1). Thus, the KG equation is just the wave equation for
a massive particle, and then the general solution is given as a superposition
of (properly normalized) plane waves of the form φp(t, x) ∝eip·x−iEt, with
momentum p and energy E2 = p2 +m2 (p = |p|). This solution reinforces the
interpretation of parameter m as the mass of the scalar ﬁeld.
At the quantum level, the scalar ﬁeld φ is taken as a quantum operator, so
that its expansion is of the form
ˆφ(t, x) =

p
$
ˆapφp(t, x) + ˆa†
pφ∗
p(t, x)
%
,
(3)
where we recognize the annihilation ˆap and creation ˆa†
p operators which obey
the usual commutation relations. We should think of functions φp(t, x) as
a complete basis of functions formed with the solutions of the KG equa-
tion (2). That is, the quantum scalar ﬁeld is a time-dependent quantum oper-
ator (within the so-called Heisenberg picture), and the coeﬃcients in (3) are
solutions of the classical KG equation (2).
Deﬁning the number operator ˆNi = ˆa†
iˆai, the state vectors on which the
quantum operators act are such that
ˆNi|N1, N2, ...⟩= Ni|N1, N2, ...⟩,
(4)
where Ni will represent the number of particles with momentum pi. The
aforementioned states can be constructed if we assume that there is a vacuum
state |0⟩= |0, 0, ...⟩, and then we obtain the other states according to the
known formula for creation and annihilation operators
ˆa†
i|N1, N2, .., Ni, ..⟩=

Ni + 1|N1, N2, .., Ni + 1, ..⟩,
(5)
ˆai|N1, N2, .., Ni −1, ..⟩=

Ni|N1, N2, .., Ni −1, ..⟩.
(6)
The states constructed in this manner are orthonormal, and represent particle
states, each composed of many scalar particles of mass m.
substituting E →i∂t and p →i∇in the classical energy conservation equation
E = p2/(2m), then the KG equation appears from using instead the relativistic
equation E2 = p2 + m2.
2 In general, we deﬁne the mass of the scalar ﬁeld as ∂2
φV (φc) = m2, where φc
denotes the scalar ﬁeld at the minimum of the potential.

1.2 Self-gravitating Scalar Fields
All of the above formalism can be generalized to the case of an arbitrary
curved spacetime with metric gµν. We would like to stress in here that ex-
pansion (3) can be used in any spacetime, curved or not. Hence, functions φp
are (appropriately) orthonormal functions that form a complete basis of solu-
tions of the KG equation in a curved spacetime. The rest of the formalism is
preserved: assuming the existence of a vacuum state, a set of quantum states
can be constructed using the creation and annihilation operators3.
The gravitational interaction for classical scalar ﬁelds is taken into ac-
count by the Einstein equations, which are generically written in the form
Gµν = 8π GTµν. The so called Einstein tensor Gµν is constructed from the
geometrical properties of the spacetime, while Tµν is the energy-momentum
tensor of matter. For a classical scalar ﬁeld, the energy-momentum tensor can
be obtained from the Lagrangian (1), and then
Tµν = φ;µφ;ν −1
2gµν [φ;σφ;σ + 2V (φ)] .
(7)
However, if we are taking scalar ﬁelds as quantum operators, so is the
energy-momentum tensor, and then the expectation value of the latter is what
appears on the r.h.s. of the Einstein equations; this is known as semiclassical
approximation that have revealed so many surprises.
With this in mind, we can deﬁne the expectation values of the energy
density and momentum density ﬂux, respectively, as ρφ = −⟨| ˆT 0
0 |⟩and P i =
⟨| ˆT i0|⟩, where the bra-ket operation is done over all of the quantum number
states, that is,
⟨| |⟩≡

particles with momentum pi.
When working with scalar ﬁelds, whether classical or quantum, we require
to solve the classical EKG equations in a curved spacetime. Hence, in the fol-
lowing sections, we will review (typical) classical solutions of the EKG system
in Cosmology.
2 Cosmological Solutions
For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, the spacetime is described by the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. For simplicity, we shall only consider the
spatially ﬂat case. In such a space time, the scalar ﬁeld is homogeneous and
3 The quantum theory in a curved spacetime is far richer than the brief description
I have given here; for many more details see the classical text [1].

298
L. Arturo Ure˜na–L´opez
isotropic too, and then the (basis) functions depend only on time, φ = φ(t).
The KG equation we have to solve is
¨φ + 3H ˙φ + m2φ = 0 ,
(9)
where a dot means derivative with respect to time.
Eq. (9) can be solved easily if there is a regime in which H < m. In this
case, the scalar ﬁeld φ oscillates with a time scale (given by m−1) shorter
than the expansion time scale (given by H−1), so that the universe only feels
the energy density averaged on a large number of oscillations. The averaged
energy density goes as ⟨ρφ⟩∼a−3, and then the scalar ﬁeld behaves as cold
dark matter [4, 5, 6]. This is the main result of this section.
The discussion in the above paragraph is quite general, and applies to any
massive scalar ﬁeld, that is, to any scalar ﬁeld potential with a minimum
around which it can be written quadratically in ﬁrst approximation.
3 (Real) Scalar Field Stars: Oscillatons
We are also interested in studying the kind of gravitationally-bounded objects
scalar ﬁelds can form. The motivation for this is to investigate whether a scalar
ﬁeld, which in some circumstances can behave as cold dark matter, can also
form stable cosmological structure.
It is known that there are long-lived solutions of the EKG equations in a
spherically symmetric spacetime, which are generically called oscillatons [7].
We will describe below these objects in both the relativistic and Newtonian
regimes.
3.1 Relativistic Oscillatons
The most general spherically-symmetric spacetime in the polar-areal slicing
reads
ds2 = α2(t, r)dt2 + a(t, r)dr2 + r2dΩ2 ,
(10)
where dΩis the usual solid angle element. The EKG equations in this space-
time are simple, but have to be solved numerically. It was a bit surprising
that the most general solution can be given as a (convergent) Fourier series
of the form [7, 8]
φ(t, r) =

j=0
φj(r) cos (jωt) ,
(11)
and similar expansions are used for the metric functions α and a, too.
Parameter ω is called the fundamental frequency, and its values are deter-
mined from an eigenvalue problem, which arises once one imposes the bound-
ary conditions of regularity at the center (∂rφj(0) = 0), and of asymptotic

ﬂatness at large distances (φj(r →∞) = 0). The total mass of each conﬁg-
uration, i.e., for each eigenvalue of ω, is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of a
representative radius Rmax. Notice that there is a maximum point, indicating
the existence of a critical conﬁguration. As a matter of fact, the conﬁgurations
on the left of the critical point are intrinsically unstable, whereas those on the
right are long-lived4.

λC is the Compton length of the scalar ﬁeld. The mass units are given by m2
Pl/m,
where mPl is the Planck mass. This ﬁgure was taken from [8].
3.2 Newtonian Oscillatons
The relativistic conﬁgurations described above are in the strong-ﬁeld regime,
and can be very compact objects. However, it is also our interest to study the
weak-ﬁeld limit, in which gravity interactions and velocities (v/c ≪1) are
small [9, 10].
One ﬁrst step is to realize that higher order modes in expansion (11)
contribute less and less as the scalar ﬁeld becomes weak, more precisely, as
√
8πGφ ∼O(v2/c2) ≪1. Hence, in the weak ﬁeld limit one expects the
contribution of only the ﬁrst term. It is then convenient to write a weak-ﬁeld
expansion as
√
8πGφ(t, r) = ψ(t, r)eimt + C.C. ,
(12)
where ψ is a complex function in general. Notice that the weak-ﬁeld limit
translates into the constraint |ψ| ∼O(v2/c2) ≪1.
Likewise, we have to expand the metric coeﬃcients in order to separate
out its weak-ﬁeld limit contributions. We will not go into the details, but it is
enough to expand the gtt metric coeﬃcient in the form
4 We are being careful of not saying stable, since the numerical runs we arranged
to test stability can only prove it for ﬁnite (though certainly long) times.

L. Arturo Ure˜na–L´opez
α2(t, r) = 1 + 2U(t, r) ,
(13)
where function U(t, r) can be identiﬁed with the usual Newtonian potential,
which is also of order U(t, r) ∼O(v2/c2) ≪1.
Preserving only the terms of order O(v2/c2) ≪1 in the EKG equations,
we ﬁnd the so-called Schr¨odinger-Newton (SN) equations that govern the dy-
namics of the scalar ﬁeld φ in the weak-ﬁeld limit,
i∂τψ = −1
2∇2ψ + Uψ ,
(14)
∇2U = |ψ|2 ,
(15)
where we have made use of dimensionless time (τ = mt) and distance variables
(x = mr), which are normalized by the scalar ﬁeld mass m.
To better visualize the properties of (weak-ﬁeld) Newtonian oscillatons,
we deﬁne a weakness parameter as λ2 =
√
8πGφ, so that λ ∼O(v/c). Thus,
it can be veriﬁed that the SN system possesses (i.e., is invariant under) the
following scaling symmetry
τ, r, ψ, U →λ−2τ, λ−1r, λ2ψ, λ2U .
(16)
Such an invariance implies some expected properties of the SN system. To
begin with, it conﬁrms that the complex ﬁeld ψ and the Newtonian potential
U are of order ∼O(v2/c2).
But it also tells us about the time and distance scales typical of Newtonian
oscillatons. As in the relativistic case, these scales are determined by the mass
of the scalar ﬁeld. In the Newtonian case, though, time and distance scales
are larger as the system becomes weaker (λ →0). In other words, Newtonian
oscillatons can be much larger and live much longer that their relativistic
counterparts.
Equilibrium conﬁgurations can be also found for Newtonian oscillatons,
in which the complex ﬁeld is of the form ψ = ϕ(r)e−iγt. Under the same
assumptions of regularity at the origin and asymptotic ﬂatness, the solution
of the SN system becomes an eigenvalue problem from which we can determine
the (eigen) frequency γ. Notice that in order to preserve the scaling symmetry
of the SN system, the frequency should scale as γ →λ2γ.
Due to the scaling symmetry, all of the possible Newtonian oscillatons
can be obtained through a scale transformation applied to a properly chosen
equilibrium conﬁguration. For simplicity, one usually chooses the one in which
ϕ(0) = 1.
We show in Fig. 2 a plot M (mass) vs Rmax for Newtonian oscillatons.

scalar ﬁeld model for dark matter. Up to this point, we have described the

transformation (16). Also shown are the migration paths of other conﬁgurations that
end up at the line representing 0-node (ground) equilibrium conﬁgurations. This
shows that (0-node) Newtonian oscillatons are in general attractor solutions. The
mass units are given by m2
Pl/m, where mPl is the Planck mass. Figure from [9].
properties of self-gravitating scalar ﬁelds endowed with a quadratic scalar
potential. We argued that such a potential is a good approximation to any
scalar potential with a minimum, and then the relevant free parameter is the
scalar ﬁeld mass m.
We have just to ﬁnd out which values of the scalar ﬁeld mass m could
have physically interesting consequences. The constraints we have to take
into account are the following.
•
The standard cosmological model requires the existence of a matter domi-
nated era in order to allow the formation of structure. This in turn implies
that the scalar mass cannot be too small, and that m ≥Heq, where Heq
denotes the value of the Hubble parameter at the time of equivalence be-
tween radiation and matter [4, 6].
•
On the other hand, real galaxies are Newtonian objects, for which v/c ∼
10−3, so that Newtonian oscillatons should be the appropriate scalar ob-
jects to describe them, if we think of a scalar ﬁeld as a good dark matter
candidate. Hence, as the size of a Newtonian oscillaton would have to be
of the order (λm)−1 > 10 kpc, this implies that m ≤0.1pc−1 ∼10−22eV
[10].
Resuming in, we see that the more massive a scalar ﬁeld is, the earlier that
it behaves as cold dark matter. On the other hand, the lighter a scalar ﬁeld
is, the larger a Newtonian oscillaton is, and then the more likely it can ﬁt
galactic observations.
Therefore, the two constraints above are complementary: cosmological evo-
lution imposes a lower bound on the scalar mass, whilst galactic evolution im-
poses on it an upper bound. That is, we cannot expect any scalar ﬁeld model
to ﬁt observations at all scales, but it must be a very particular model.

Our group has determined, through a more detailed study, that a massive
scalar ﬁeld should have a mass of about m ∼10−23eV in order to accomplish
all of cosmological observations in a decent manner [4, 5].
However, there may be properties we are not taken into account properly,
as extra terms in the scalar potential may add desirable properties and then
alleviate the constraints imposed upon the free scalar ﬁeld. We expect to re-
port on them in a future communication.
