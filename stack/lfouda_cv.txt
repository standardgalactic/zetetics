Yale University
Postdoctoral Associate
I am a part of the Center for Biodiversity and Global Change at Yale University where I work as part of the
Biodiversity Movement and Global Change group.
My work focuses on understanding the drivers and impacts of animal movement on a changing planet.
I utilise high-resolution global animal movement data to explore space use and changes over time. I hope
to identify how conservation practices and projects aid in the protection of highly mobile and migratory
species.

British Antarctic Survey
Research Associate
I worked with two teams at the British Antarctic Survey. The first team is analysing acoustic recordings
from South Georgia. The second team (Whales from Space) is reviewing VHR satellite images collected
from the Antarctic peninsula.
In the acoustic monitoring project, I identified underwater sound sources. The main focus is to monitor
recovering populations of baleen whales in South Georgia.
In the ‘Whales From Space’ project I classified features of interest and environmental conditions within
each VHF image. The main focus is to examine humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) presence and
habitat use across the year.
