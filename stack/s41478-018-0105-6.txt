Abstract  The proposed Fuzzy Logic and Distance Measure based Adaptive Fil-
ter (FDMA) uses the principles of fuzzy logic and distance measure for the detec-
tion and correction of fixed-value impulse noise, respectively. This filter, in the noise 
detection phase, classifies the pixel of the corrupted image either as uncorrupted or 
corrupted ones, using fuzzy logic and statistical measures and thereby constructs 
a flag matrix. In the noise correction phase, the intensity of each corrupted pixel 
is replaced by an estimated intensity value, computed using its uncorrupted neigh-
bouring pixel, lying within Minimum Euclidian Distance. The noise suppression 
capability of this filter is quantitatively measured using Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, 
Mean Structural Similarity Index Matrix and Coefficient of Correlation values. 
Additionally, the merit of this filter is endorsed by Human Visual Perception of the 
restored images. The noise restoration ability of FDMA is confirmed to outperform 
the reported filters. This filter can seamlessly be employed in the application domain 
wherein fixed-value impulse noise is the primary cause for quality degradation.

1  Introduction
In the recent years, the applications of digital image processing techniques have 
expanded their frontiers to diverse areas like molecular structure studies, surface 
chemistry, remote sensing, medical diagnosis and forensic science. Image restoration 
is one of the preprocessing techniques that improve the quality of an image distorted 
by noise or blur. Noise is unwanted and undesirable information distributed over the 
image which can be conceptualized as mathematical and/or statistical models. Gen-
erally, noise attenuates due to the imperfections in the devices and process of image 
acquisition/transmission as well as due to the unfavourable atmospheric conditions. 
There is a compelling need to restore such impulse noise corrupted images, in order 
to make them more suitable for higher order image processing methods [1, 2].
It is evident from the literature that the non-linear filters outperform the linear 
filters due to their edge and detail preserving potentials. In general, non-adaptive 
filters have a major drawback of altering the intensities of impulse-free pixels too, 
while denoising as those filters do not possess any mechanism to differentiate the 
impulse-prone pixels from its counterparts. The researchers, in order to overcome 
this major drawback have devised many adaptive filters with a mechanism to detect 
the corrupted pixels in a degraded image and to correct them [3].
These adaptive non-linear filters are generally devised using mathematical/sta-
tistical tools, soft computing techniques and intuitive methods, etc., for detection 
and correction. The mathematical and statistical tools provide a viable platform to 
develop such filters. Adaptive median-based denoising techniques and Partial Dif-
ferential Equations (PDE) based filters are found to be more effective than the clas-
sical linear and non-linear filters. The soft computing methods, such as fuzzy and 
neural network based filters are proved to complement the performance of the image 
processing techniques. Among the new strategies of noise suppression, fuzzy logic 
systems are broadly used to develop computationally simple and high performing 
filters.
The newly devised adaptive non-linear filter FDMA uses fuzzy logic for noise 
detection and distance measure for noise correction. This filter is confirmed to 
restore even the digital images corrupted with 90% noise density.
The fixed-value impulse noise model is described in Sect. 2 and a brief account 
on the noise filters report in the literature is given in Sect. 3. The metrics used for 
the performance evaluations of FDMA are detailed in Sect. 4. The computational 
procedure of FDMA is given in Sect. 5. The results and discussion are presented in 
Sect. 6 and the conclusion in Sect. 7.
2  Noise model
Impulse noise commonly creeps into images due to faulty sensors and transmission 
media. Fixed-value impulse noise assumes either minimum or maximum intensity 
value of the dynamic range of image intensity and the percentage of noise distribu-
tion is equally divided among those two intensity values [1].

Fuzzy logic and distance measure based adaptive fixed value…
The probability distribution of fixed-value impulse noise of p % in a corrupted 
image I′ is described as:
where ­Imax and ­Imin are noise intensities. ­Ui,j is the probability of the uncorrupted 
pixels in I′ [4].
3  Related works
The Standard Median filter (SM) uses a window which is also known as a mask or 
template that partitions the input image into either overlapping or non-overlapping 
subimages. The intensity value of each pixel lying at the center of each window 
is replaced by the median of the pixels bounded by that window [4]. The Center 
Weighted Median filter (CWM) assigns a weight to the central pixel of the window 
while finding the median and replaces it with the computed median [5]. Iterative 
Median filter (IMF) aims to suppress noise iteratively, using the principle of median 
filter. It is proved to perform better than CWM and SM [6]. Signal Dependent Rank 
Order Median filter (SDROM) aims to replace every false signal (i.e. pixel intensity) 
by an approximated intensity, which is estimated from its neighbouring true infor-
mation and this method is proved to be efficient than its predecessors [7]. The CWM 
filter with modified adaptive and recursive approaches named as Adaptive Center 
Weighted Median (ACWM) and Recursive Adaptive Center Weighted Median 
(ACWMR) filter respectively have exhibited better noise suppression potential [8].
Switching median filter, an adaptive noise filter uses a pre-defined threshold 
value to locate and correct the noise-prone pixels subsequently. The threshold value 
is ideally determined by the researchers either intuitively or by trail-and-error. The 
Tri-State Median filter (TSM) is an adaptive switching filter that uses either SM or 
CWM filter for noise suppression. The decision for noise correction is made using a 
threshold value [9, 10].
The researchers have also developed many PDE-based filters. The numerical 
solution formulae of PDE are used for the correction of the corrupted pixel. These 
filters are applied selectively on impulse valued pixels in the image. The PDE filter 
is found to yield better results than the other filters [11–13]. The threshold-based 
median filters techniques have also produced significant results. The decisive based 
non-local mean filters compute the local statistics to find the noisy pixels and correct 
those pixels using the reference image-based non-local statistics [14, 15].
Fuzzy Systems provide greater degree of independence to frame the problem-
specific rules and inferences which are proved to be computationally simple. The 
denoising filter proposed by Sun and Russo is reported to give better results using 
fuzzy logic than other median based filters [16–19].

4  Metrics used
4.1  Hit ratio
The potential of noise detection of a filter is assessed by the Hit Ratio, which is a ratio 
between the number of actual noise pixels and number of correctly spotted noisy pixels 
in a given corrupted image. It is mathematically represented as:
where Hit and Miss respectively represents the number of noisy pixels that rightly 
identified and the number of noisy pixels which are missed during detection.
The performance of FDMA filter is recorded both quantitatively as Peak Signal-to-
Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Structural Similarity Index Matrix (MSSIM) and Coeffi-
cient of Correlation (CoC) and qualitatively in terms of Human Visual Perception.
4.2  Peak signal‑to‑noise ratio (PSNR)
The PSNR measures the denoising degree of a filter, on the corrupted image as:
where the Mean Square Error (MSE) is computed as
where Ir,c and I′r,c denote the pixels of original image and restored image respec-
tively, N denotes the number of pixels in the row or column of the given image [4]. 
The PSNR Values ensures the quality of the images. If the PSNR values are high, 
the image is high quality image otherwise it is poor quality.
4.3  Structural similarity index matrix (sSIM)
The MSSIM is calculated as:

where K represents the number of windows for the process, I′
p and rp are the noisy 
and restored image respectively. The SSIM refers to the Structural Similarity Index 
Matrix which is computed as:
where 휇I′ and 휇r represent the mean of noisy image and restored image respectively. 
휎I′ and 휎r represent the variance of corrupted and restored image respectively. C1 
and C2 are the arbitrary constants. The MSSIM values are lies between 0 and 1. If 
the value tends to 1, the image guarantees the edge preservation that is similar to 
original image.
4.4  Coefficient of correlation
The CoC is computed as:
where Ir,c and Ir,c
′  represents the Original and Restored Image respectively and their 
means are denoted as μI and μI′. The CoC ensures the similarity relation between the 
original and restore image. If the CoC value tends to 1, then the restored image is 
similar to original image.
5  FDMA filter
The FDMA filter presented in this paper consists of two phases namely, noise detection 
and noise correction. The noise detection is achieved through fuzzy inference while 
noise correction is carried out by fuzzy normalization by using Distance Measure.
5.1  Fuzzification of the noisy image
The noise image is transformed into fuzzy member values using the fuzzy membership 
function given in Eq. 8. The fuzzy values of the pixels of an input image lie between 
0.5 and 1. The fuzzy membership function of FDMA is framed as given in Eq. (8).

where µ(i, j) represents the fuzzy member values of the corrupted image I′ at the 
spatial coordinates (i, j) and Max represents the noisy image and the maximum 
intensity value of the noisy image respectively. The value of a and b are arbitrarily 
set as 8 and 247 which can be fixed.
The grayscale values are divided into 32 segments. The first and last segment is 
the darkest member and brightest member respectively. As these segments are con-
sidered as noisy, their values assumed as 1 and fuzzy member value is computed for 
the rest of the segments. The flag matrix is constructed with 0 s and 1 s representing 
the noise-free fuzzy members and noisy fuzzy member respectively.
5.2  Noise correction
The adaptive correction process, instantly decides to correct the corrupted pixels 
with reference to the flag matrix values. For every 1 in the flag matrix, the normal-
ized intensity values of I′ are computed using uncorrupted neighbourhood values 
which are qualified by the distance measure as per in Eq. (8) and are left unchanged 
otherwise. For every member value which is traced to be corrupted, the uncorrupted 
intensity values in the nearest neighbourhood are found in all direction of the cor-
rupted pixel. The distances of the uncorrupted values are computed using Eq. (8). 
Then, the corrupted value is replaced by an uncorrupted pixel at the minimum dis-
tance. This process is carried over in the entire image.
where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) represent the coordinates of the pixel under process and 
an uncorrupted neighbouring pixel.
5.3  Defuzzification
After fuzzy normalization, the fuzzy member values are converted into their image 
intensity values using a defuzzification function, given in Eq. (10):
where r(i, j) represents the intensity values of the restored image, µ(i, j) is the nor-
malized fuzzy value and Max is the maximum intensity of the image.

Algorithm of FDMA Filter
Phase I: Noise Detection
Input: Corrupted image I´
Output: Flag Matrix, FX
Step 1: Read the corrupted image (I´).
Step 2: Convert the corrupted images into fuzzy members set (μ) using membership function as in 
Eq. (8).
Step 3: Construct the flag matrix using the following Fuzzy Rules.
F(i, j) =
{
1 if 휇(i,j) = 1
0 Otherwise
1 ≤i ≤M, 1 ≤j ≤N
Phase II: Noise Correction
Input: Corrupted image I′, Flag Matrix F,
Output: Restored Image R
Step 1: If F(i, j) = 1 then compute the distance between the membership value of the corrupted and every 
uncorrupted ones in the neighbourhood.
Step 2: Select the nearest uncorrupted membership value with minimum distance, using Eq. (9).
Step 3: Replace the corrupted values by the minimal distanced uncorrupted value
Repeat this process for the entire image.
Step 4: Fuzzy member values are converted into image pixel values using Defuzzification function in 
Eq. (10)
Step 5: Stop.
The fuzzy-based noise detection procedure of FDMA thoroughly detects all the 
corrupted pixels with 100% accuracy, for any given degree of noise densities. Hence, 
every corrupted pixel is suitably replaced by its nearest uncorrupted neighbour.
6  Results and discussion
The FDMA filter is developed using Scilab. The filter was tested on the standard 
images like Lena, Mandrill, Saturn, Cameraman and Peppers and also on some real 
images, of size 256 × 256. Table 1 shows the hit ratio of the FDMA. If the hit ratio of 
a noise detection technique is nearer to 1 then its noise detection potential is inferred 
to be very good and weak otherwise.
From Table 1, it is apparent that the noise detection is excellent for the images 
with the noise density of 30% and above. For the rest of the noise densities, the 
Hit Ratio is much acceptable. The noise detection algorithm never misclassifies the 
noise-prone in the corrupted images.
The performance of this filter is compared with other high performing noise fil-
ters in terms of PSNR values for Mandrill and Lena images, which are depicted 
in Tables 2 and 3 respectively [18]. Both tables endorse the merit of FDMA filter. 
Table 2 shows that FDMA filter produces the highest PSNR values than the other 
filters for 10–90% noise densities, which is reconfirmed Table 3 as well.
The proposed filter is tested Lena (512 × 512) grayscale image and is com-
pared with high performing filters such as Standard Median Filter (SMF), Adap-
tive Median Filter (AMF), Universal Impulse Noise Filtering using GP (UIN-
FGP), Impulse Noise Filtering using GP (INFGP), Robust Outlyingness Ratio

- Non-Local Means (ROR-NLM), Impulse Noise Detection and Estimation using 
Genetic Programming (INDEGP) [20–22]. The FDMA filter outperforms than 
other high performing filters in terms of PSNR values which is listed in Table 4.
The MSSIM values of FDMA filter are enlisted in Table 5. It shows that this 
filter produces the highest MSSIM values than other filters for the noise densities 
above 40%. For the rest of the noise densities, it gives comparable MSSIM values 
with ATSM, LEAM and MPATS filters. MSSIM values of the devised filter are 
superior to TSM and SM filters.

The CoC values of FDMA filter recorded in Table 6. It is evident that FDMA 
filter gives good CoC values than the other filters reported in literature. The CoC 
values of FDMA filter exhibit that the restored images of FDMA filter are quite 
similar to the original Images.
The time complexity of this filter was computed on the test images using Intel 
Core 2 Duo Processor 2.33 GHz. The average computation time of the five high 
performing filters was recorded in Table 7, with respect to 25 trails. The FDMA 
filter is confirmed to have the least computation time among the filters chosen 
for comparison namely TSM, ATSM, MPATS and LEAM filters. The respective 
chart for the Average Running Time is depicted in Fig. 1.

The human visual perception of the restored output images also substantiates the 
efficiency of FDMA filter in terms of quality. Figures 2 and 3 depict the degree of noise 
suppression as well as the detail and edge preservation potential of this filter.
Figures 4 and 5 exhibits the potential of noise reduction of FDMA filter on the cor-
rupted real-time colour images. Figure 6 shows the performance of FDMA on the real 
images such as Thermal Mammogram Image, Satellite Image and SEM image of Gold 
Nano Particle.

7  Conclusion
The newly devised FDMA filter is proved to effectively denoise the images cor-
rupted with fixed-value impulse noise of probabilities 10–90%. This filter is 
found to be more efficient than other high performing fixed-value impulse noise 
filters in terms of PSNR, MSSIM and CoC values. The human visual perception

of the filtered images too authenticates the merit of this filter. It is evident from 
the restored images of various types that FDMA filter exhibits higher edge and 
detail preservation potential on the restored images in the least computation time.
