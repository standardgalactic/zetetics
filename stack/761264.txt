The
recent
applications
of the stochastic
variational
method
is reported.
Besides
the
review of the earlier

for atomic,
nuclear
and subnuclear

presented.
1. Introduction
The stochastic
variational
method
(SVM)
optimizes
the variational
trial
functions
by
randomly
selecting
their nonlinear
parameters.
This approach
has a long history
and has
been used in different
subfields
of physics.
In quantum
chemistry
the explicitly
correlated
gaussian
basis functions
has often been parametrized
by “random
tempering”
[1] and the
basis functions
which most significantly
contribute
to the ground
state
energy
are selected
by “sorting”
[1]. In nuclear
physics
the stochastic
variational
method
has been
invented
to solve few-nucleon
problems
by successively
increasing
the variational
basis adding
ran-
domly
selected
new states
[2].
Condensed
matter
physicists
often
face the
problem
of
diagonalization
of extremely
large matrices
and the
“stochastic
diagonalization”
[3] has
proved
to be a very useful
tool.
All of these
methods
are examples
of stochastic
opti-
mization,
a method
that
has earned
its popularity
by being
able to avoid traps
of local
minima.
In this work the following variant
of the stochastic
variational
method
is used:
First
we
set up a basis by successively
increasing
the number
of states
adding
randomly
selected
new elements
to the basis.
To select a new element
we randomly
generate
several
states
and
compare
the
energy
gain
obtained
by adding
them
to the
basis.
The
state which
lowers the energy
most
is added
to the basis.
This
procedure
is continued
until
energy
“significantly”
decreases.
After the energy
seems to converge
and further
increase
of the
dimension
does not really improve
the ground
state
energy, we start
to “refine”
the basis
parameters.
In the refining
cycle the number
of basis states
is fixed and the basis states
are reoptimized
replacing
the previous
states
by a new better
random
set.
This procedure
is cyclically
repeated
until there
is no improvement
in the energy.
Further
details
can be
found in Ref.
[4].
We have used correlated
Gaussian
basis functions
in our calculations.
The
correlated
Gaussians
offer computational
advantages:

2.
Atomic
physics
To test the method
we have calculated
many well-known
quantum
mechanical
systems,
especially
Coulombic
systems
(small
atom
and molecules)
and
compared
the results
to
those
of other
methods.
Our
results
are in very
good
agreement
with
those
of other
methods
for Coulombic
few-body
systems.
Some examples
are shown in Table
1.
We have investigated
the stability
and structure
of systems
comprising
a negative
ion
and positrons
[8] by the stochastic
variational
method.
It is shown that
the H– and the
Li-
ions can bind not only one but two positrons.
The binding
energies
of these
double
positronic
atoms
E(H-
,e+,e+)=0.57eV
and E(Li- ,e+,e+)=0.15eV
are somewhat
smaller
than those of their single positronic
counterparts
(E(HPs)=l.06eV
and E(LiPs)=O.32
eV).
We have also found that
a system
of Ps-,
Ps-
and a proton
is bound.
(See Table
2.)
J. Mitroy
and
his collaborators
have extensively
used
the
SVM
and its
“fixed core”
variant
[9–11] to study
the binding
of positrons
and positroniums
to atoms.
They
have
proved,
for the first time,
that
a position
can cling itself to a neutral
Lithium
[9]. Later
they have shown that
many
atoms
(Na,Cu,Ag,Be,Mg,
Zn) is capable
to bind a positron.
These electronically
stable
states
do decay by the process of electron-positron
annihilation.
It is also shown
that
besides
the H atom
the Lithium,
Natrium
and Kalium
atoms
also
form bound
state
with
a positronium
(HPs,LiPs,NaPs
and KPs).

Nuclear
physics
Our primary
goal is to use the SVM to calculate
the energies
and other
properties
of
light
nuclei by using
realistic
interactions.
This
is an obviously
challenging
application
due to the noncentral
forces and strong
repulsive
core of the nuclear
interaction.
We have
calculated
the energies of the triton
and the alpha particle
by different
realistic
interactions
[16]. The
energies
obtained
were in good
agreement
with
other
methods.
In particular
we agreed with the results
of the Green Function
Monte
Carlo
(GFMC)
calculations
[15]
within
the statistical
error (+ 0.2MeV)
of the GFMC.
The GFMC
calculations
have been
greatly
improved
in the last few years
and
the statistical
error
for the
alpha
particle
is
about
O.OIMeV.
We have repeated
our calculation
for the alpha
particle
improving
our
approach
in two respects.
We have used the full “A” matrix
, combined
with
a global
vector
representation
for the orbital
part.
In the previous
calculation
the matrix
of the
nonlinear
parameters
were chosen to be diagonal,
and a (truncated)
partial
wave expansion
was used.
In these
calculations
not only the nonlinear
parameters
but
the spin-isospin
components
and the orbital
quantum
numbers
are also randomly
chosen.
Our results
are
improved
by about
150 keV (see Table
3.
and
4.).
There
is a nice agreement
between
SVM and the Faddeev-Yakubovski
calculation
for the expectation
values
of the different
components
of the interactions
(the GFMC
is only exact for the energies,
the expectation
values are based
on an approximation).
Other
methods
[18] give similar
results.
Calculations
for A=6
nuclei
are under
way.
The
convergence
of the
energy
requires
considerable
larger
basis for these systems.
At present
the energy
of the 6Li is below the
alpha particle
threshold
but it is not bound
with respect
to the alpha-deuteron
level. The
‘He is likely to be unbound
without
three-body
interaction.

Atoms
in strong
magnetic
fields
The theoretical
interest
in the studies
of atomic
and molecular
systems
in magnetic
field
is motivated
by a number
of experimental
observations.
One of these
is the discovery

the strong
magnetic
field on (magnetic)
white dwarfs
[19] (~ 107 G) and on the surface
of
neutron
stars
[20] (X 1012 G). (The strongest
available
laboratory
magnetic
field strength
is about
106 G.) On the other
hand
there
are a lot’s of experiments
on excitons,
excitonic
complexes
and quantum
dots
in semiconductors.
The
small
effective
masses
and
large
dielectric
constant
results
in very large effective field strength
in these
systems.
Beyond
the perturbation
regime,
the
Coulomb
interaction
is rivaled
by the
external
magnetic
field and
the
calculation
of the binding
energies
of multielectron-systems
be-
comes
very complicated.
In these
systems
the spherical
symmetry
of the
Coulomb
in-
teraction
is strongly
broken
by the magnetic
field.
This intricate
geometry
of the highly
anisotropic
charge distribution
is very challenging
for conventional
theoretical
approaches
and only the hydrogen
and helium
atom
has been
solved with
accuracy
required
by the
spectroscopical
needs.
Precise
calculation
of the
spectra
of light
elements
in magnetic
field would greatly
help the interpretation
of the optical
absorption
spectra
and therefore
the understanding
of the composition
of the atmosphere
of stars.
The
conventional
form
of the
CG’S are spherically
symmetric,
so for example
for a
two-particle
system
they
are assumed
in the simple
exp{–olr~
– a2r~ – /3r1rz} form.
In
the case of a strong
magnetic
field the particles
are in the field of an isotropic
harmonic
oscillator
in the x-y plane.
The spherical
CG basis does not provide
sufficient
flexibility
to describe
this
situation
because
its parameters
in the
x-y and
z direction
are equal.
The simplest
extension
of the CG’S to tackle
this problem
is to choose different
nonlinear
parameters
in the x-y plane
and in the z direction:
exp{–al
(x? + y~) – al..z~ – a2(z~ +
!):) – cw2zi – P(z1z2 + YIW)
– /3Az2}.
By choosing equal parameters
in the x-y plane
and z-direction the deformed CG (DCG)
basis trivially
reduces
to the spherical
one, but
in the case of magnetic
field it has the required
flexibility
to be able to describe
of the
harmonic
oscillator
wave function
in the x-y plane
and motion
governed
by the Coulomb
interaction
in the
z direction.
At the
same
time,
the
basis
allows for the
correlation
between
the electrons.

We choose a deformed
form of the correlated
Gaussians
(DCG):
(4)
where
the
nonlinear
parameters
are different
(and
independent)
in the
“xy”
and
“z”
directions
(pi =
(xi, yi)).
This
extension
brings
a great
deal of flexibility
by allowing
a
separate
description
on the
“xy” plane
and
along
the
“z” axis.
The
Hamiltonian
does
not commute
with L2 but it has common
eigenfunctions
with Lz. The above form of the
DCG belongs
to M = O. To allow for M # O states
we multiply
the basis by
hfw(~i)
where
&m(p)= (z + Zv)m.

our variational

Charged
excitons
in semiconductor
quantum
wells
Negatively
(X-)
and positively
(X+) charged
excitons
in quantum’
wells have been the
subject
of intense
studies
in the last years, both
experimentally
and theoretically.
These
studies
revealed
that,
due to the confinement,
the 2 dimensional
charged
excitons
have
binding
energies which are an order of magnitude
larger than
the charged
excitons
in the
corresponding
bulk
materials.
Due to the increased
binding
energy
these
systems
can
be studied
in room
temperature
and
this
also opens
the
way for various
technological
applications
(e.g. lasers,
etc.)
The Hamiltonian
of a negatively
charged
exciton
in a quantum
well is, in the effective
mass approximation,
given by
~=
T1e+T2e+Th+vc+vle+v2e+Vh,
(7)
where
le, 2e indicate
the electrons
and h the hole; Vie, Vh are the quantum
well confine-
ment potentials;
Ti is the kinetic
energy operator
for particle
i. The confining
interaction
is modelled
by a square
well potential:
V(z) = O if
[z[ < a
and
V(z)
= V.
otherwise.
(8)
Due to this confinement
in the z-direction
the spherical
symmetry
is broken and we have to
use the trial functions
introduced
in the previous
section.
While the Coulomb
three-body
problem
is relatively
easily solvable
with excellent
accuracy
in the spherically
symmetric
case this cylindrical
geometry
poses considerable
difficulties
in obtaining
accurate
results.
Our results
are compared
to the experimental
values [26] in Figure
1. This figure shows the
dependence
of the experimental
and theoretical
binding
energies
of the negatively
charged
exciton
on the well widths
in a GaAs/AIGaAs
quantum
well. The theoretical
results
for
the binding
energy
are represented
by a shaded
region
which
gives the accuracy
of our
calculation
for the binding
energy.
Note that
the accuracy
obtained
for the total
energy
is better
than
l%, however,
its error propagates
and increases
because
of the subtractions
which
have
to be made
in order
to obtain
the
binding
energy,
which
is one order
of
magnitude
lower than
the total
energy.
The
results
are reported
in detail
in [28]. The
investigation
of the effect of magnetic
field on confined
excitonic
complexes
is under
way.

Summary
,-
The SVM is a very simple and powerful
approach
to solve few-body
problems
in physics.
Flurry
of examples
in atomic,
nuclear
and solid state
systems
shows its effectiveness
and
usefulness.
One of the major
limitation
of the method
is that
by increasing
the number
of
particles,
the evaluation
of the matrix
elements
gets longer and longer on the computer.
That
prevents
us from trying
the necessary
number
of random
candidates
and lowers the
chance
of finding the most
appropriate
parameters.
