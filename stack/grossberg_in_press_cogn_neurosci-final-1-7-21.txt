Hard criteria or explanatory scientific theory?
Doerig, Schurger, and Herzog list ‘hard criteria for 
empirical theories of consciousness’. Their abstract 
notes that ‘many Theories of Consciousness (ToCs) 
have been proposed,’ ‘diverse in nature,’ that exhibit 
a ‘lack of stringent criteria specifying how empirical 
data constrains ToCs’. They ‘review 13 of the most influ­
ential ToCs’ and ‘their strengths and weaknesses from 
a strictly empirical point of view’.
Listing ‘stringent criteria’ is not how scientific pro­
gress on developing theories of mind and brain usually 
occurs. Typical humans have conscious experiences of 
seeing, hearing, feeling, and knowing. Thousands of 
psychological and neurobiological experiments about 
vision and these other faculties have been carried out 
for over a century. The psychological experiments clarify 
how visual stimuli cause conscious experiences of visual 
qualia – including perceived form, color, brightness, 
depth, and motion – and when consciousness fails. 
Many neurobiological experiments have correlated con­
scious experiences with brain dynamics.
To understand these data, theorists discover organi­
zational principles that are embodied in a small number 
of equations. In mind/brain studies, these equations 
help to define modules, or microcircuits, which are spe­
cialized in modal neural architectures, where ‘modal’ 
stands for different modalities of biological intelligence, 
including vision. An integrated self with a conscious 
mind is possible because it builds on a shared set of 
equations and modules within modal architectures that 
can interact seamlessly together to generate emergent 
properties that mimic detailed properties of conscious 
psychological experiences (Grossberg, 2017b).
The foundational equations describe short-term mem­
ory, or STM; medium-term memory, or MTM; and long- 
term memory, or LTM, that were introduced in Grossberg 
(1968, 1969); see Grossberg (2013b) for a review.
In Section 1, Doerig et al. write about ‘whether we can 
close the explanatory gap or whether it is impossible for 
principled reasons’. This gap actually started to be closed 
40 years ago (Grossberg, 1980). They mention only a few 
data, and write that ‘maybe the plethora of ToCs simply 
reflects the fact that we have too few experimental 
constraints’ (Section VI), despite the existence of huge 
databases about conscious experiences that have been 
getting explained and simulated on the computer for 
many years. Their underconstrained analysis cannot lead 
to mechanistic understanding.
All conscious states are resonant states, but not 
conversely
Humans also have conscious experiences of hearing, feel­
ing, and knowing, and huge interdisciplinary databases 
describe them. In all these areas, the interdisciplinary com­
putational neural theory called Adaptive Resonance 
Theory, or ART, links brain mechanisms to their emergent, 
or interactive, properties that embody psychological

functions and conscious experiences. ART shows how adap­
tive resonances enable us to be conscious of all these kinds 
of experiences, while binding them together into coherent 
moments of unified conscious awareness. ART provides 
detailed mechanistic explanations of all the issues and 
data mentioned by Doerig et al., as sketched below.
ART has been incrementally developed since it was 
proposed in Grossberg (1976) to explain and predict 
how humans learn to attend, recognize, and predict 
objects and events in a changing world. ART was not 
derived to explain consciousness. However, as its unify­
ing explanations became increasingly mature, it became 
clear that ‘all conscious states are resonant states, but 
not conversely’. For recent reviews, see Grossberg 
(2013a, 2017b, 2018, 2021). For a summary of resonances 
that support different conscious experiences, see 
Figure 1.
A thought experiment shows that ART solves 
a universal problem of error correction
ART design principles and mechanisms can be derived from 
a thought experiment that asks the question: How can 
a coding error be corrected in a changing world if no indivi­
dual cell knows that one has occurred (Grossberg, 1980)?
Using only familiar environmental facts as hypoth­
eses, every step of the thought experiment is translated 
into processes operating autonomously in real time with 
only locally computed quantities. Thus, when familiar 
environmental constraints on incremental knowledge 
discovery are overcome in a self-organizing manner, 
then ART circuits naturally emerge as a universal solution 
to correcting errors in a changing world.
Resonances that are not conscious
Resonant states that are not conscious include parietal- 
prefrontal resonances that trigger selective opening of 
basal ganglia gates to enable the read-out of contex­
tually-appropriate thoughts and actions (Brown et al., 
2004; Buschman & Miller, 2007; Grossberg, 2016b) and 
entorhinal-hippocampal resonances that dynamically 
stabilize the learning of entorhinal grid cells and hippo­
campal place cells during spatial navigation (Grossberg 
and Pilly, 2014; Kentros et al., 2004; Morris & Frey, 1997). 
These resonances do not include feature detectors that 
are activated by external senses, such as those that 
support vision or audition, or internal senses, such as 
those that support emotion.

Why did evolution discover consciousness? 
Seeing is for reaching
Evolution may have discovered conscious states because 
multiple processing stages carry out three functionally 
distinct processes of ‘hierarchical resolution of uncer­
tainty’ to construct brain representations that are suffi­
ciently complete, context-sensitive, and stable to control 
effective actions (Grossberg, 2017b). The visual represen­
tation on the retina is noisy and incomplete. For exam­
ple, the large blind spot and retinal veins prevent the 
processing of connected objects that are registered by 
the retina at their positions. Multiple stages of boundary 
completion and surface filling-in complete the retinal 
representation (Grossberg, 2016a).
How do our brains select sufficiently complete visual 
representations to control actions? My answer is that 
brain resonance, and with it conscious awareness, is trig­
gered at complete representational stages to escape the 
disastrous consequences that could occur were actions 
based on incomplete representations at earlier proces­
sing stages. For example, we consciously see in order to 
look and reach based upon a surface-shroud resonance 
(Figure 2) that occurs between cortical area V4 and the 
posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The selected V4 represen­
tations attend objects to act upon via PPC (Grossberg, 
2017b, 2019). We consciously recognize what we see 
using a feature-category resonance V4 and the inferotem­
poral cortex (IT); see Figures 2 and 3. These two 
resonances synchronize when we see and know about 
a familiar object.
Explaining mental disorders using ART
Resonances can fail or be degraded due to anatomical 
lesions or improperly functioning neuromodulators. ART 
provides neural explanations of psychological symp­
toms and neurobiological data about how conscious­
ness is altered during mental disorders like Alzheimer’s 
disease, autism, amnesia, Fragile X syndrome, and 
neglect, including a key role for acetylcholine neuromo­
dulation in regulating the vigilance with which cognitive 
learning, attention, and consciousness occur (Franklin & 
Grossberg, 2017; Grossberg, 2017a, 2017b; Grossberg & 
Kishnan, 2018; Grossberg & Seidman, 2006).
Rivalry, change blindness, crowding, masking, 
attentional blink, and Hermann grid
Doerig et al. mention several visual phenomena, notably 
those in this section’s title, that have all been explained 
by interactions between model visual cortical processes 
that preprocess visual inputs and the surface-shroud 
resonances that support consciously seeing them; e.g., 
binocular rivalry and percepts of unimodal vision 
(Grossberg et al., 2008); change blindness, motion- 
induced blindness, masking, and attentional blink 
(Grossberg, 2017b); crowding (Foley et al., 2012); and 
Figure 2. Seeing and knowing. A surface-shroud resonance that supports conscious seeing and a feature-category resonance that 
supports conscious knowing, or recognition, can occur simultaneously and be supported by a synchronous resonance that bridges the 
What and Where cortical streams. [Adapted with permission from Grossberg (2017b).].

Hermann grid (Grossberg and Todorovic, 1988). Scores 
of additional visual percepts have also been explained in 
a unified way; see sites.bu.edu/steveg.
Cortical synchronization, gamma and beta 
oscillations, and wakefulness and sleep
The authors mention gamma oscillations in Section IV.4.a. 
In spiking laminar thalamocortical ART models, faster 
gamma oscillations emerge during a good enough 
match between bottom-up and top-down signals, as dur­
ing a feature-category resonance (Figure 3), whereas a big 
enough mismatch causes slower beta oscillations 
(Grossberg & Versace, 2008), a prediction with subsequent 
support from neurophysiological experiments on V1, V4, 
and hippocampus.
ART clarifies how brains switch between wakefulness 
and sleep, and explains UP and DOWN sleep states 
(Grossberg, 2017a).
Gaze direction and social cognition
How gaze direction enables us to ‘infer the mental state 
of others and to predict their behavior’ (Section IV.4.b) is 
explained by how joint attention supports goal-oriented 
orienting, reaches, and tool use during social cognition 
(Grossberg & Vladusich, 2010).
Unfolding and large and small networks
The authors note that ‘any function can be implemented 
by different physical systems’ (Section III.4). However, 
sufficiently rich multiplexed combinations of functions 
cannot be so implemented. Indeed, ART uniquely fol­
lows from a thought experiment about a universal pro­
blem about error correction in a changing world 
(Grossberg, 1980).

Figure 3. During a feature-category resonance, a bottom-up input pattern activates a distributed pattern of feature-selective cells 
which send bottom-up signals to a category coding level. These bottom-up signals are multiplied by adaptive weights, or long-term 
memory (LTM) traces, that are tuned by learning. An activated category reads out a top-down expectation. These top-down signals are 
also multiplied by LTM traces. These expectations help to focus attention upon expected combinations of cues, called critical feature 
patterns, that control learning and action. If a good enough match occurs between the top-down expectation and a currently active 
bottom-up feature pattern, then a feature-category resonance begins to form between them via the active bottom-up and top-down 
excitatory pathways. This resonance supports conscious recognition of the object that is represented by the attended critical feature 
pattern. [Reprinted with permission from Grossberg (2019).].

Resonance, and Synchrony – the CLEARS processes – 
cannot be unfolded into a feedforward network 
(Grossberg, 2019).
Classifying biological neural models like ART as either 
small or large is unhelpful because, to explain why we 
are conscious, ART’s multiple processing stages carry out 
a ‘hierarchical resolution of uncertainty’ in a particular 
order.
