T R A N S L A T O R ’S N O T E
Edmund Husserl’s Ideen zu einer reinen Phanomenologie undph'anomeno- 
logischen Philosophic, Erstes Buch: AUgemeine Einfuhrung in die reine PKdno- 
menologie, was first published in 1913 in the first volume of Jahrbuchfur 
Philosophie und phanomenologische Forschung, edited by Edmund 
Husserl, Adolf Reinach, Max Scheler, Moritz Geiger and Alexander 
Pfander (Halle: Max Niemeyer), pp. 1-323. In 1922 the book was 
reprinted with an “ Ausflihrliches Sachregister” prepared by Gerda 
W alther. Reprinted again in 1928, the book contained a “Sachregis­
ter” prepared by Ludwig Landgrebe replacing that of Gerda 
W alther. A new edition of the book was published in 1950 by 
M artinus NijhofT, The Hague. Edited by W alter Biemel, the title 
page states that the edition is a “Neu, auf Grund der handschriftli- 
chen Zusatze des Verfassers erweiterte Auflage.” This edition, pub­
lished as Volume III of Edmund Husserl, Gesammelte Werke (Hus- 
serliana) included additions, insertions and marginal notes of Husserl 
which were either run into the text itself or printed in a section of 
“Textkritische Anmerkungen” (pp. 463^83). Much of this supple­
mentary material was taken from three copies of Ideen which Husserl 
annotated between 1913 and 1929. Biemel also included as ap­
pendices manuscripts of Husserl in which he either developed further 
certain ideas in the text or else tried to rewrite existing sections of the 
book.
In 1976 Biemel’s edition was replaced by one edited by Dr. Karl 
Schuhmann (Husserliana III, 1 and III, 2), also published by M ar­
tinus NijhofT. This new edition establishes a corrected text of the 
three editions printed during Husserl’s lifetime and contains, in a 
second volume, revised and corrected texts of the supplementary 
material found in Biemel’s edition along with material not found in 
that edition. In addition to reproducing Husserl’s annotations in still

another copy of Ideen (the copies are identified as Copies A, B, C, D),1 
this edition prints, among others, all of the manuscripts which 
Husserl had prepared for W. R. Boyce Gibson but which the latter 
did not use in his translation.2
Every effort has been made to conform the present translation to 
the text as published by Dr. Schuhmann. Included in footnotes is a 
representative selection of Husserl’s annotations in his four copies of 
Ideen along with a number of very short appendices. The source of the 
note is identified according to Dr. Schuhm ann’s edition (e.g., 
‘‘Addition in Copy A” ), while Husserl’s own footnotes in the printed 
editions during his lifetime are identified by the locution, 
“A U T H O R ’S FO O TN O TE.” Numbers of the appendices refer to 
Dr. Schuhm ann’s arrangement of them. Unless otherwise stated, the 
supplementary material is to be applied after the word to which the 
footnote is affixed. All internal page references, including those of the 
indices, are to the pages of the first printed edition and which appear 
in the margins of the pages.
Although all of the supplementary materials published by Dr. 
Schuhmann is valuable to anyone seeking a thorough scholarly and 
philosophical understanding of Husserl’s great work (Dr. Schuh­
mann published 38 pages of Husserl’s annotations, and 132 pages of 
appendices), chiefly for reasons of economy I have translated only a 
selection of this material. As a consequence, the make up of this 
volume differs from that of Dr. Schuhmann. Taken as a whole, 
however, the supplementary materials included in the present trans­
lation provide what, in my judgment, is a good picture of a significant 
commentary by Husserl on his own text over a period of about 
sixteen years and which, I believe, will satisfy the immediate needs of 
the English-speaking reader.
1 For a discussion of the nature and dating of Husserl’s annotations in these copies, see 
Schuhmann’s account in Husscrliana III, 2, pp. 657f., and his “ Einieitungdes Herausgebers” in 
III, 1, pp. Lff. According to Schuhmann (III, 2, p. 478), Copy A was annotated from 1913 to 
1929; Copy B between 1914 and 1921; Copy C ca. 1921, and Copy D in the Fall of 1929.
* 
Dated from around 1925 to 1929, these manuscripts are printed in III, 2, pp. 627-651, and 
discussed by Schuhmann in III, 1, pp. XLVIIff. The manuscripts chiefly concern the second 
chapter of Part II of Ideen, and reflect Husserl’s attempt both to reformulate the line of thought 
in that chapter concerning the psychological and transcendental reductions, and to rewrite the 
text in such a way that it is brought up to the level of his thought in the late 1920’s. An 
important and detailed study of the various groups of manuscripts involved in the genesis and 
development of Ideen also can be found in the second volume of Karl Schuhmann’s Die Dialektik 
der Phdnomenologie (Den Haag: Martinus NijhofT, 1973); and a penetrating study of Ideen is given 
in the same author’s Die Fundamentalbetrachtung der Phanomenologie. £um Weltproblem in der 
Philosophie Edmund Husserls (Den Haag: Martinus NijhofT, 1971).

A basic concern in making this translation has been to preserve 
Husserl’s distinctions in English and to render his ideas by ex­
pressions which conform to the things themselves which he sought to 
describe. O f great help in this connection was the Guidefor Translating 
Husserl by Dorion Cairns3. The translation also benefited from a 
comparison with the following published translations: Idles directrices 
pour unephenomenologie, traduit de l’allemand par Paul Ricoeur (Paris: 
Gallimard, 1950); Ideas relativas a una fenomenologia puray una Jilosofia 
fenomenoldgica; con las adiciones, notas marginales y correcciones 
postumas, traducido por Jose Gaos (Mexico-Buenos Aires: Fondo de 
Cultura Economica, 1962); and Ideas: General Introduction to Pure 
Phenomenology, translated by W. R. Boyce Gibson (London: George 
Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1931).
A translation is always only that — a translation. While it is 
possible to make Husserl’s philosophy accessible and, hopefully, 
equally plausible in English, it is also to be hoped that final judgm ent 
of the work will be made of the expression of this philosophy in the 
original, and that the failings of the translator will not be laid to the 
author.
I dedicate this translation to the memory of my Mother, who 
thoughtfully gave me my copy of Ideen as a graduation present from 
college; and to the memory of Dorion Cairns, who patiently helped, 
me learn to read it.
W. R. Boyce Gibson’s translation of Ideen was of great help to me in 
preparing my translation, and I have tried to preserve the high 
standard he set for the translation of Husserl. I wish to express here 
my deep gratitude to Professor Q. B. Gibson of the Australian 
National University for his generous cooperation in permitting the 
publication of my translation.
I also wish to acknowledge the help and encouragement in prepar­

the papers left by Dorion Cairns at his death in 1973 was a very early draft of about half of Ideen,

exceptions, this draft did not conform at all to Cairn’s translations of Cartesian Meditations (The

IDEAS PERTAINING TO A PURE PHENOMENOLOGY AND TO A 
PHENOMENOLOGICAL PHILOSOPHY
IN T R O D U C T IO N  
<1>
Pure phenomenology, the way to which we seek here, the unique 
position of which relative to all other sciences we shall characterize 
and show to be the science fundamental to philosophy, is an es­
sentially new science which, in consequence of its most radical 
essential peculiarity, is remote from natural thinking and therefore 
only in our days presses toward development. It is called a science of 
“phenomena” . O ther sciences, long known, also concern pheno­
mena. Thus we hear that psychology is designated as a science of 
psychical “appearances” or phenomena and that natural science is 
designated as a science of physical “appearances” or phenomena; 
likewise on occasion historical phenomena are spoken of in the 
science of history, cultural phenomena in the science of culture; and 
something similar is true of all other sciences of realities. No m atter 
how varied may be the sense of the word “phenomena” in such 
locutions, and no m atter what further significations it may have, it is 
certain that phenomenology also relates to all these “phenomena” 
and does so with respect to all significations of the word “pheno­
menon.” But phenomenology relates to them in a wholly different 
attitude whereby any sense of the word “phenomenon” which we 
find in the long-known sciences becomes modified in a definite way.
To understand these modifications or, to speak more precisely, to 
bring about the phenomenological attitude and, by reflecting, to 
elevate its specific peculiarity and that of the natural attitudes into 
the scientific consciousness — this is the first and by no means easy 
task whose demands we must perfectly satisfy if we are to achieve the 
realm of phenomenology and scientifically assure ourselves of the 
essence proper to phenomenology.
During the last decade much has been said in German philosophy <2> 
and psychology about phenomenology. In supposed agreement with

the Logische Untersuchungen} phenomenology has been conceived as a 
substratum of empirical psychology, as a sphere comprising “imma- 
nental” descriptions of psychical mental processes, a sphere compris­
ing descriptions that — so the immanence in question is understood
— "are strictly confined within the bounds of internal experience. It 
would seem that my protest against this conception2 has been of little 
avail; and the added explanations, which sharply pinpointed at least 
some chief points of difference, either have not been understood or 
have been heedlessly pushed aside. Thus the replies directed against 
my criticism of psychological method are also quite negative because 
they miss the straightforward sense of my presentation. My criticism 
of psychological method did not at all deny the value of modern 
psychology, did not at all disparage the experimental work done by 
eminent men. Rather it laid bare certain, in the literal sense, radical 
defects of method upon the removal of which, in my opinion, must 
depend an elevation of psychology to a higher scientific level and an 
extraordinary amplification of its field of work. Later an occasion will 
be found to say a few words about the unnecessary defences of 
psychology against my supposed “attacks.”3 I touch on this dispute 
here so that, in view of the prevailing misinterpretations, ever so rich 
in consequences, I can sharply emphasize from the start that pure 
phenomenology> access to which we shall prepare in the following essay
— the same phenomenology that made a first break-through in the 
Logische Untersuchungen, and the sense of which has opened itself up to 
me more deeply and richly in the continuing work of the last decade
— is not psychology and that neither accidental delimitations of its field 
nor its terminologies, but most radical essential grounds, prevent its 
inclusion in psychology. No m atter how great the significance which 
phenomenology must claim to have for the method of psychology, no

is placed in square brackets.

m atter how essential the “foundations” which it furnishes for it, pure 
phenomenology (if only because it is a science of ideas) is no more 
psychology than geometry is natural science. Indeed, the difference 
proves to be an even more radical one than that in the case com­
pared. The fact that pure phenomenology is not psychology is in no 
respect altered by the fact that phenomenology has to do with4 
“consciousness,” with all sorts of mental processes, acts and act- 
correlates. W hat with the prevailing habits of thinking, to achieve an 
insight into that indeed requires no little effort. T hat we set aside all 
hitherto prevailing habits of thinking, that we recognize and tear 
down the intellectual barrier with which they confine the horizon of 
our thinking and now, with full freedom of thought, seize upon the 
genuine philosophical problems to be set completely anew made 
accessible to us only by the horizon open on all sides: these are hard 
demands. But nothing less is required. Indeed, what makes so extra­
ordinarily hard the acquisition of the proper essence of phenome­
nology, the understanding of the peculiar sense of its problems, and 
of its relationship to all other sciences (in particular to psychology), is 
that, for all this, a new style of attitude is needed which is entirely altered 
in contrast to the natural attitude in experiencing and the natural 
attitude in thinking. To move freely in it without relapsing into the 
old attitudes, to learn to see, distinguish, and describe what lies 
within view, require, moreover, peculiar and laborious studies.
It will be the pre-eminent task of this First Book to seek ways by 
which the excessive difficulties of penetrating into this new world can 
be overcome, so to speak, piece by piece. We shall start from the 
natural standpoint, from the world as it confronts us, from5 consci­
ousness as it offers itself in psychological experience; and we shall lay 
bare the presuppositions essential to psychological experience. We 
shall then develop a method of “phenomenological reductions” <of 
psychological experience), with respect to which we cannot only do 
away with barriers to cognition that belong to the essence of every 
natural style of research but which, at the same time, also divert the 
one-sided direction of regard proper to every natural style of research 
until we shall have acquired, finally, the free vista of “ transcendent­
a l^ ” purified phenomena and, therewith, the field of phenome­
nology in our peculiar sense.

Let us draw the preliminarily indicative lines yet a little more 
definitely; and let us start from psychology as demanded not only by 
the prejudices of the times but also by the internal communities of the 
matter in question.
Psychology is an experiential science. Two things are implied in the 
usual sense of the word “experience:”
1. It is a science offacts, of matters of fact in David Hume’s sense.
2. It is a science of realities. The “phenomena” that it, as psych- 
<4> ological “phenomenology,” deals with are real occurrences which, as
such occurrences, if they have actual existence, find their place with 
the real subjects to whom they belong in the one spatiotemporal 
world as the omnitudo realitatis.
In contradistinction to that, pure or transcendental phenomenology will 
become established, not as a science of matters of fact, but as a science of 
essences (as an “eidetic” science); it will become established as a science 
which exclusively seeks to ascertain '‘cognitions of essences” and no 
“matters of fact” whatever. The relevant reduction which leads over 
from the psychological phenomena to the pure “essence” or, in the 
case ofjudgm ental thinking, from matter-of-fact (’’empirical” ) uni­
versality to “eidetic” universality, is the eidetic reduction*
Secondly, the phenomena of transcendental phenomenology will become char­
acterized as irreal \irreal\. Other reductions, the specifically transcend­
ental ones, “purify” psychological phenomena from what confers on 
them reality and, with that, their place in the real “world.”7,8 O ur 
phenomenology is to be an eidetic doctrine, not of phenomena that 
are real, but of phenomena that are transcendentally reduced.
W hat all this signifies will become distinct in greater detail only in 
what follows. In a precursory manner, it designates a schematic 
framework of the introductory series of investigations. I hold it 
necessary to add only one remark here. 11 will strike the reader that in 
the aforementioned two points, instead of the generally customary 
single separation of sciences into sciences of realities and sciences of 
idealities (or into empirical sciences and a priori sciences), two 
separations of sciences appear to be used which correspond to the two 
contrasting pairs: m atter of fact and essence, real and non-real. In 
place of the usual contrast between real and ideal, the distinguishing

reduction into eidetic and specifically phenomenological.
7 Insertion in C.opy A: and in any real world whatever.
H Marginal note in Copy D: The manner of expression is dangerous.

of these two contrasts will find a detailed justification in the later 
course of our investigations (and particularly in the Second Book). 11 
will become apparent that the ordinary concept of reality needs a 
fundamental limitation according to which a difference between real 
being and individual being (temporal being simpliciter) must be 
established. The transition to pure essence yields, on the one side, 
eidetic cognition of the real; on the other side, with respect to the 
remaining sphere, it yields eidetic cognition of the irreal. Moreover, 
it will become apparent that all transcendentally purified “mental 
processes” ["Erlebnisse”] are irrealities posited outside any incorpo­
ration into the “actual world.” Just these irrealities are explored by 
phenomenology, not, however, as single particulars, but in “es­
sence.” To what extent, however, transcendental phenomena as <5> 
single facts are accessible to an investigation and what relationship 
such an investigation of matters of fact may have to the idea of 
metaphysics, can only be considered in the concluding series of 
investigations.9
In the First Book, however, we shall not only treat the general 
doctrine of phenomenological reductions, which make transcendent­
ally purified consciousness and its eidetic correlates visible and ac­
cessible to us; we shall also attem pt to acquire definite ideas of the 
most general structure of this pure consciousness and, mediated by 
them, of the most general groups of problems, lines of investigations, 
and methods which belong to the new science.10
In the Second Book we shall then treat in detail some particularly 
significant groups of problems, the systematic formulation and char­
acteristic solution of which are the precondition for being able to 
make actually clear the difficult relationships of phenomenology, on 
the one hand, to the physical sciences of Nature, to psychology and to 
the cultural sciences; on the other hand, however, to all the a priori 
sciences. The projected phenomenological sketches on this occasion 
offer at the same time welcome means of considerably deepening the 
understanding of phenomenology gained in the First Book and of 
acquiring an incomparably richer recognition of its vast areas of 
problems.

A Third and concluding Book is devoted to the idea of 
philosophy.11
The insight will be awakened that genuine philosophy, the idea of 
which is the actualizing of absolute cognition, is rooted in pure 
phenomenology; and rooted in it in a sense so important that the 
systematically strict grounding and working out of this first of all 
genuine philosophies is the incessant precondition for every meta­
physics and other philosophy “ that will be able to make its appear­
ance as a science”
Because phenomenology will become established here as a science 
of essence — as an “a priori” or, as we also say, an eidetic science — it 
is useful to let all efforts that are to be devoted to phenomenology 
itself be preceded by a series of basic expositions concerning essences 
and eidetic science and, in opposition to naturalism, a defense of the 
original independent legitimacy of eidetic cognition.
We close these introductory words with a brief consideration of 
<6> terminology. As already was the case in the Logische Untersuchungen, I 
avoid as much as possible the expressions “a priori” and “a posteriori” 
because of the confusing obscurities and many significations clinging 
to them in general use, and also because of the notorious philosoph­
ical doctrines that, as an evil heritage from the past, are combined 
with them. They are to be used only in contexts that confer upon 
them unambiguousness and only as equivalents of other terms which 
are joined to them and on which we have conferred clear and univocal 
significations, particularly where it is a m atter of allowing for histori­
cal parallels.
With the expressions Idee [idea] and Ideal [ideal], it is perhaps not 
quite so bad with respect to disconcerting varieties of significations, 
though, on the whole, still bad enough, a fact to which the frequent 
misinterpretation of my Logische Untersuchungen have made me suffi­
ciently sensitive. In addition, the need to keep the supremely import­
ant Kantian concept of idea cleanly separated from the universal con­
cept of (either formal or material) essence decided me to make a 
terminological change. I therefore use, as a foreign word, the ter- 
minologically unspoiled name “Eidos” ; and, as a German word, the 
name “ Wesen” [“essence”] which is infected with harmless but oc­
casionally vexatious equivocations.
u Marginal note in Copy D: Phenomenology as first philosophy.

Probably I should also have eliminated the badly burdened word 
Real [real], if only a fitting substitute had offered itself to me.
Generally, the following must be noted. Because it will not do to 
choose technical expressions that fall entirely outside the frame of 
historically given philosophical language and, above all, because 
fundamental philosophical concepts are not to be defined by means 
of firm concepts identifiable at all times on the basis of immediately 
accessible intuitions; because, rather, in general long investigations 
must precede their definitive clarifications and determinations: com­
bined ways of speaking are therefore frequently indispensable which 
arrange together a plurality of expressions of common discourse which 
are in use in approximately the same sense and which give termin­
ological pre-eminence to single expressions of this sort. One cannot 
define in philosophy as in mathematics; any imitation of m athem at­
ical procedure in this respect is not only unfruitful but wrong, and has 
most injurious consequences. For the rest, each of the above termin­
ological expressions is to receive its fixed sense by means of a deter­
minate, intrinsically evident validation of that sense in the de­
liberations to be carried out. Meanwhile, circumstantial critical 
comparisons with the philosophical tradition in this respect, as in all 
others, must be renounced if only because of the length of this work.

CHAPTER ONE
M A T T E R  OF FA C T AND ESSENCE
§1. Natural Cognition and Experience.
Natural cognition begins with experience and remains within 
experience. In the theoretical attitude which we call the “natural99
<theoretical attitude>x the collective horizon of possible investigations is 
therefore designated with one word: It is the world. Accordingly, the 
sciences of this original2 attitude are, in their entirety, sciences of the 
world; and, as long as it is the exclusively dominant theoretical 
attitude,> the concepts “true being,” “actual being,” that is, real 
being and — since everything real joins together to make up the 
unity of the world — “being in the world” coincide.
To each science there corresponds an object-province as the 
domain ofits investigations; and to all its cognitions, i.e., here to all its 
correct statements, there correspond, as primal sources of the 
grounding which validates their legitimacy, certain intuitions in 
which objects belonging to the province become themselves-given as 
existing and, at least some of them, given originarily. The presentive 
intuition [gebende Anschauung] belonging to the first, the “ natural” 
sphere of cognition and to all sciences of that sphere, is natural 
experience; and the <natural> experience that is presentive of some­
thing originarily is perception, the word being understood in the ordi-

hi.stork al-devclopmental genesis need be, or should be, thought of when we speak here of 
originality. What other sense is meant will not become reflectively and scientifically clear until 
later. From the start, however, everyone feels that the empirical-concrete cognitions of matters 
of fact being earlier than every other cognition, e.g., every mathemetical-ideal cognition, need 
not have an Objective temporal sense. Addition to this sentence in Jirstand third printed editions: and is

<8> nary sense.3 To have something real given originarily and “at­
tentively to perceive”4 and “experience” it in an intuiting simpliciter 
are one and the same. We have originary experience of concrete 
physical things in “external perception,” but no longer in memory or 
in forward-regarding expectation; we have originary experience of 
ourself and5 of our states of consciousness in so-called internal or self­
perception; not, however, of others and of* their mental processes in 
“empathy.” As belonging to them, we “view the mental processes of 
others” on the basis of the perception of their outward manifestation 
in the organism. This empathic viewing is, more particularly, an 
intuiting, a presentive act, although no longer an act that is pre­
sentive of something originarily. The other and his psychical life are, 
to be sure, given in consciousness as “ themselves there” and in union 
with his organism; but they are not, like the latter, given in conscious­
ness as originary.7
The world is the sum-total of objects of possible experience and 
experiential cognition, of objects that, on the basis of actual 
experiences, are cognizable in correct theoretical thinking. This is 
not the place to discuss how the methods of experiential science look 
when seen more closely, how that method grounds its right to go 
beyond the narrow bounds of direct experiential givenness. Sciences 
of the world, thus sciences in the natural attitude, the sciences of 
material nature, but also those of animate beings with \he\r psychophys­
ical nature, consequently also physiology, psychology, and so forth, 
are all so-called natural sciences in the narrower and broader sense. 
Likewise all the so-called Geisteswissenschaften belong here: the science 
of history, the sciences of culture, sociological disciplines of every sort. 
Concerning these we can, for the present, leave it an open question 
whether they should be treated as like the natural sciences or con­
trasted with them, whether they should be regarded as themselves 
natural sciences or as sciences of an essentially novel type.

§2. Matter of Fact. Inseparability of Matter of Fact and Essence.
Experiential sciences8 are sciences ^ “matters of fact.” The founding 
cognitional acts of experiencing posit something real individually; 
they posit it as something factually existing spatiotemporally, as 
something that is at this temporal locus, that has this duration of its 
own and a reality-content which, with respect to its essence, could 
just as well have been at any other temporal locus. On the other 
hand, it is posited as something that is at this place, in this physical 
shape (or else is given in union with something organismal having 
this shape), whereas the same real something considered with respect 
to its own essence could just as well be at any other place and have <9> 
any other shape, could also be changing though it is in fact unchang­
ing, or could be changing otherwise than in the manner in which it is 
changing in fact. Individual existence of every sort is, quite univers­
ally speaking, “contingent ” It is thus; in respect of its essence it could 
be otherwise. Even though definite laws of Nature obtain according 
to which if such and such real circumstances exist in fact then such 
and such definite consequences must exist in fact, such laws express 
only de facto rules which themselves could read quite otherwise. 
Moreover, they already presuppose, as something pertaining from 
the start to the essence of objects of possible experience, that objects of 
possible experience which are governed by them are, considered in 
themselves, contingent.
But the sense of this contingency, which is called factualness, is 
limited in that it is correlative to a necessity which does not signify the 
mere de facto existence of an obtaining rule of coordination among 
spatiotemporal matters of fact but rather has the character of eidetic 
necessity and with this a relation to eidetic universality. When we said 
that any m atter of fact, “in respect of its own essence,” could be 
otherwise, we were already saying that it belongs to the sense of anything 
contingent to have an essence and therefore an Eidos which can be apprehended 
purely; and this Eidos comes under eidetic truths belonging to different 
levels of universality. An individual object is not merely an individual 
object as such, a “This here,” an object never repeatable; as qualit- 
ied “in itself9 thus and so, it has its own specific character, its stock of 
essential predicables which must belong to it (as “an existent such as it 
is in itself’) if other, secondary, relative9 determinations can belong

to it. Thus, for example, any tone in and of itself has an essence and, 
highest of all, the universal essence tone as such, or rather sound as 
such — taken purely as the moment that can be singled out in­
tuitively in the individual tone (alone or else by comparing one tone 
with others as “something common” ). In like manner any material 
thing has its own essential species and, highest of all, the universal 
species “any material thing whatever,” with any temporal deter­
minations whatever, any duration, figure, materiality whatever. 
Everything belonging to the essence of the individuum another individuum can 
have too; and highest eidetic universalities of the sort just indicated in 
our examples delimit “regions” or “categories” of individual

[individuelle Anschauung] .n
At first “essence” designated what is to be found in the very own being 
ofan individuum as the W hat of an individuum. Any such W hat can, 
however, be “put into an idea.” Experiencing, or intuition of something 
individual can become transmuted into eidetic seeing (ideation) — a 
possibility which is itself to be understood not as empirical, but as 
eidetic. W hat is seen when that occurs is the corresponding pure 
essence, or Eidos, whether it be the highest category or a particulari­
zation thereof— down to full concretion.
This seeing which is presentive of the essence12 and, perhaps, presentive 
of it originarily, can be an adequate one such as we can easily obtain in, 
for example, a seeing of the essence tone. But it can also be a more or 
less imperfect, “ inadequate” seeing, and not only in respect of a greater 
or lesser clarity and distinctness. The specific character of certain 
categories of essences is such that essences belonging to them can be 
given only “onesidedly,” in a sequence “many-sidedly,” yet never “all- 
sidedly.” Correlatively, the individual singularizations correspond­
ing to such essences can then be experienced and otherwise ob- 
jectivated only in inadequate, “one-sided” empirical intuitions. This 
holds good for every essence relating to something physical; and it 
holds with respect to all the essential components of extension or of

materiality. Indeed, as can be seen on closer inspection (the analyses 
following later will make this evident), it holds good for all realities 
without exception, as a result of which the vague expressions one­
sidedness and many-sidedness will then take on definite significations 
and different sorts of inadequateness will become separated.
For the present it is sufficient to point out that it is essentially 
impossible for even the spatial shape of the physical thing to be given 
otherwise than in mere one-sided adumbrations and that — re­
gardless of this inadequateness which remains continually, despite all 
gain, throughout any course of continued intuitions — each physical 
property draws us into infinities of experience: that every experient­
ial multiplicity, no m atter how extensive, still leaves open more 
precise and novel determinations of the physical thing; and it does so 
in infinitum.
O f whatever sort intuition of something individual may be, 
whether it be adequate or inadequate, it can take the turn into seeing 
an essence; and this seeing, whether it be correspondingly adequate 
or correspondingly inadequate, has the characteristic of a presentive 
act. But the following is implicit in this:
The essence ( Eidos) is a new sort of object. Just as the datum of individual 
or experiencing intuition is an individual object y so the datum of eidetic intuition 0 1) 
is a pure essence.
Not a merely external analogy but a radical community is present 
here. Seeing an essence is also precisely intuition, just as an eidetic object is 
precisely an object. The universalization of the correlatively interre­
lated concepts “intuition” and “object” is not an arbitrary conceit 
but compellingly demanded by the nature of the matters in quest­
ion.13 Empirical intuition or, specifically, experience, is conscious­
ness of an individual object; and as an intuitive consciousness it 
“makes this object given,” as perception it makes an individual 
object given originarily in the consciousness of seizing upon this object 
“originarily,” in its “personal” selfhood. In quite the same manner
i3a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : H o w  hard it is in our day for psychological investigators to approp­
riate this simple and quite fundamental insight is shown in an exemplary manner by Oswald 
Kiilpe’s surprising polemic against my doctrine of categorial intuition in his work Die Reali- 
sierung <Grundlegung der Realwissenschaften> [The Positing oj Realities. Foundation of the Sciences oj 
Reality| <Leipzig: Hirzeb, 1912, Vol. I, p. 127, which has just reached my hands. I regret being 
misunderstood by the distinguished scholar. A critical reply becomes impossible, however, 
when the misunderstanding is so perfect that nothing remains of the sense of one’s own 
assertions.

intuition of an essence is consciousness of something, an “object,” a 
Something to which the intuitional regard is directed and which is 
“itself given” in the intuition; it is something which can, however, be 
“objectivated” as well in other acts, something that can be thought of 
vaguely or distinctly, which can be made the subject of true and 
false predications — just like any other “object” in the necessarily 
broadened sense proper to formal logic. Any possible object — logically 
speaking, “any subject of possible true predications” — has, prior to all 
predicative thinking, precisely its modes of becoming the object of an 
objectivating, an intuiting regard which perhaps reaches it in its 
“personal selfhood,” which “seizes upon” it. Seeing an essence is 
therefore intuition; and if it is seeing in the pregnant sense and not a 
mere and perhaps vague making present, the seeing is an originarily 
presentive intuition, seizing upon the essence in its “personal” self­
hood.14 On the other hand, it is an intuition of an essentially peculiar 
<12) and novel sort in contrast to the sorts of intuition which correlatively 
belong to objectivities ofother categories and especially in contrast to 
intuition in the usual and narrower sense, that is, intuition of some­
thing individual.
Certainly its own specific character is such that intuition of essence 
has as its basis a principal part of intuition of something individual, 
namely an appearing, a sightedness of something individual, though 
not indeed a seizing upon this nor any sort of positing as an actuality; 
certainly, in consequence of that, no intuition of essence is possible 
without the free possibility of turning one’s regard to a “correspond­
ing” individual and forming a consciousness of an example — just as, 
conversely, no intuition of something individual is possible without 
the free possibility of bringing about an ideation and, in it, directing 
one’s regard to the corresponding essence exemplified in what is 
individually sighted; but this in no respect alters the fact that the two 
sorts of intuition are essentially different; and propositions such as we have 
just stated indicate only the essential relations between them. To the 
essential differences between the intuitions there correspond the 
essential relationships between “existence” (here obviously in the 
sense of individual factual existent) and “essence,” between matter of
I4a u t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : In the Logische Untersuchungen 1 used the word Ideation [ideation] for 
the seeing that is originarily presentive of an essence and even, in most cases, for adequate 
seeing of that kind. But obviously a freer concept is required which encompasses every 
consciousness directed simply and immediately to an essence and apprehending it, positing it 
- in particular, every “obscure,” thus non-intuiting, consciousness of that kind.

fact and Eidos. Following up such interconnections, with insight we 
seize upon the conceptual essences which correspond to these terms 
and will be firmly attached to them from now on; and thus all the semi- 
mystical thoughts clinging particularly to the concepts Eidos (idea) and 
essence will remain cleanly separated from them.15
§4. Eidetic Seeing and Phantasy. Eidetic Cognition Independent of All 
Cognition of Matters of Fact.
The Eidos, the pure essence, can be exemplified for intuition in 
experiential data — in data of perception, memory, and so forth; but 
it can equally well be exemplified in data of mere phantasy. Accord­
ingly, to seize upon an essence itself, and to seize upon it originarily, we 
can start from corresponding experiencing intuitions, but equally well 
from intuitions which are non-experiencing, which do not seize upon factual 
existence but which are insteadC(merely imaginative”.
I f we produce in free phantasy spatial formations, melodies, social practices, 
and the like, or if we phantasy acts of experiencing of liking or disliking, of <13) 
willing, etc., then on that basis by “ideation” we can see various pure essences 
originarily and perhaps even adequately: either the essence of any spatial shape 
whatever, any melody whatever, any social practice whatever, etc., or the 
essence of a shape, a melody, etc., of the particular type exemplified.
In this connection, it does not m atter whether anything of the sort 
has ever been given in actual experience or not. If, by some psych­
ological miracle or other, free phantasy should lead to the imaginat­
ion of data (sensuous data, for example) of an essentially novel sort 
such as never have occurred and never will occur in any experience, 
that would in no respect alter the originary givenness of the corre­
sponding essences: though imagined Data are never actual Data.
Essentially connected with this is the following: Positing of and, to 
begin with, intuitive seizing upon, essences implies not the slightest 
positing of any individual factual existence; pure eidetic truths contain not the 
slightest assertion about matters of fact. And thus not even the most 
insignificant matter-of-fact truth can be deduced from pure eidetic 
truths alone. Just as any thinking, any predicating, which concerns 
matters of fact needs experience to ground it (in so far as the essence of
15a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : Cf. my article in Logos, Vol. I, 1910/11, N o.3, p. 315. <“ Philosophie als 
stronge Wissensrhaft” [“ Philosophy as Rigorous Science,” pp. 1 lOf. ]>.

well-foundedness peculiar to such thinking necessarily demands this), so 
thinking about pure essences — unmixed thinking about them which 
does not connect matters of fact and essences — needs the seeing of 
essences as its legitimating foundation.
§5. Judgments about Essences and Judgments having Eidetic Universal 
Validity.
But the following should now be noted, Judging about essences and 
relationships among essences is not the same as eidetic judging of 
whatever sort when this concept has the breadth which must be given 
to it; eidetic cognition does not have, in the case of all its asserted propositions, 
essences as the “objects about which ” And, closely connected with this: 
Intuition of essences —  taken as it has been up to now —  as a 
consciousness analogous to experience, to seizing upon a factual 
existence, as a consciousness in which an essence is seized upon as an 
object just as something individual is seized upon in experience, is not 
the only consciousness which involves essences while excluding every 
positing offactual existence. Essences can be an intuitive consciousness 
of essences, in a certain m anner they can also be seized upon, without 
becoming “objects about which.”
Let us start with judgments. Stated more precisely, it is a m atter of 
the difference between judgments about essences and judgments 
which, in an indeterminately universal manner and without ad­
mixture of positings of the individual nevertheless judge in the mode 
Any [Uberhaupt] about the individual, though purely as a single particular
<subsumed under>1B essences [Einzelheit der Wesen]. Thus in pure geome­
try we do not judge, as a rule, about the Eidos straight line, angle, 
triangle, conic section, or the like, but rather about any straight line
16 Translator's note: For justification for translating ’’Einzelheit der Wesen” as “single part­
icular subsumed under an essence.” see below, §13, where Husserl distinguishes between the 
“subsumption” of an individual under an essence in the sense either of an infima species or a 
genus, and the subordination of an essence to its higher species or genus. It is clear that here 
Husserl speaks of an individual in the sense of a single particular with respect to the infima 
species or genus (depending on the example). Ricoeur translates “ Einzelheit der Wesen” as 
'Yas particulier des essences,” p. 26; Gaos as “caso singular de las esencias,” p. 24; and Boyce 
Gibson as “instance of essential being,” p. 58. None of these translations would seem to express 
the distinction Husserl makes; there seems to be no reason for translating “Wesen” as “essential 
being” since Husserl distinguishes essence from being.

whatever, any angle whatever — or about a straight line, an angle, or 
“as a straight line,” “as an angle,” about any individual triangles 
whatever, any conic sections whatever. Such universal judgments 
have the characteristic of eidetic universality, “pure” or, as it is also 
called, “strict ” absolutely “unconditional” universality.
For the sake of simplicity let us assume that it is a m atter of 
“axioms,” immediately evident judgments to which indeed all the 
other judgments in a mediate grounding lead back. Provided that, as 
presupposed here, they judge in the above-stated manner about 
individual single particulars, such judgments need for their noetic 
grounding — i.e., in order to make them matters of insight — a 
certain seeing of essences which one could designate also (in a modified 
sense) as a seizing upon essences; and this seeing too, like the eidetic 
intuition which makes essences objects, is based on sighting but not 
on experiencing individual single particulars <subsumed under> the 
essences. For such judgments, too, more phantasy-objectivations, or 
rather individuals sighted in phantasy, are sufficient. There is consci­
ousness of what is sighted, as sighted; it “appears” but is not seized 
upon as factually existent. If, for example, we judge with eidetic 
universality (“unconditional” universality, “pure” universality),
“Any color whatever is different from any sound whatever,” the 
statement just made can be confirmed by examining our judging. A 
single <subsumed under> the essence color and a <single subsumed> 
under the essence sound are intuitionally “objective” ["vorstellig”] as 
singles subsumed under their essences; phantasy-intuition (without a 
positing of factual existence) and eidetic intuition are there at the 
same time in a certain manner; but the latter intuition is not there as 
one which makes the essence an object. It is, however, of the essence of 
the situation which we are at all times free to shift to the correspond­
ing Objectivating attitude, that this shifting is precisely an essential 
possibility. In accord with the altered attitude, the judgment would 
be altered; it would then state: The essence (the “genus” ) color is 
other than the essence (the genus) sound. And so everywhere.
Conversely, any judgment about essences can be converted into an equivalent 
unconditionally universal judgment about single particulars <subsumed under> 
essences as single particulars subsumed under essences [dieser Wesen als 
solches]. In this manner, judgments concerning what is purely essential 
(purely eidetic judgments) belong together, no matter what their logical <15) 
form may be. W hat is common to them is that they posit no individual

existence17 even when they judge — as they may, namely with purely 
eidetic universality — about something individual.
§6. Some Fundamental Concepts. Universality and Necessity.
It is now apparent that the following ideas belong together: eidetic 
judgmg, eidetic judgment or asserted eidetic proposition, eidetic truth 
(or true proposition); as correlate of the last idea: the eidetic pre- 
dicatively formed affair-complex simpliciter (as what obtains in eidetic 
truth); finally, as correlate of the first ideas: the eidetic predicatively 
formed affair-complex in the modified sense of merely what is meant, in 
the sense of the judged as judged which can either obtain or not 
obtain.
Any eidetic particularization and singularization of an eidetically 
universal predicatively formed affair-complex, in so far as it is that, is 
called an eidetic necessity. Eidetic universality and eidetic necessity are there­
fore correlates. But the use of the word “necessity” varies following 
the interrelated correlations: the corresponding judgments are also 
called necessary. It is important, however, to heed the distinctions 
and above all not to designate eidetic universality a necessity (as 
people usually do). The consciousness of a necessity, more particular­
ly a judging consciousness in which there is consciousness of a pre­
dicatively formed affair-complex as a particularization of an eidetic 
universality, is called an apodictic18 consciousness; thejudgment itself, 
the asserted proposition, is called an apodictic (also an apodictically 
“necessary” ) consequence of the universal judgm ent with which it is 
connected. The stated propositions about the relations among uni­
versality, necessity, and apodicticity can be framed more universally 
so that they hold good for any, and not only for purely eidetic, 
spheres. Obviously, however, they require a distinctive and particu­
larly im portant sense within the eidetic limitation.
The combination of an eidetic judging about any individual what­
ever with a positing of the factual existence of something individual is also 
very important. The eidetic universality becomes transferred to an 
individual posited as factually existing, or to an indeterminately 
universal sphere of individuals (which undergoes positing as factu-
17In Copy D, existence 
changed to factual existence.

ally existent). Every “application” of geometrical truths to cases in 
Nature (Nature, posited as actual) belongs here. The predicatively 
formed affair-complex, posited as actual, is then a matter of fact in so 
far as it is an individual predicatively formed actuality-complex; it is, <16) 
however, an eidetic necessity in so far as it is a singularization of an 
eidetic universality.
The unrestricted universality of natural laws must not be mistaken for 
eidetic universality. To be sure, the proposition, “All bodies are heavy,” 
posits no definite physical affair as factually existing within the 
totality of Nature. Still it does not have the unconditional univers­
ality of eidetically universal propositions because, according to its 
sense as a law of Nature, it carries with it a positing of factual 
existence, that is to say, of Nature itself, of spatiotemporal actuality:
All bodies — in Nature> all “actual” bodies — are heavy. In contra­
distinction, the proposition, “All material things are extended,” has 
eidetic validity and can be understood as a purely eidetic proposition 
provided that the positing of factual existence, carried out on the side 
of the subject, is suspended. It states something that is grounded 
purely in the essence of a material thing and in the essence of 
extension and that we can make evident as having “unconditional” 
universal validity. We do this by making the essence of the material 
thing something given originarily (perhaps on the basis of a free 
phantasying19 of a material thing) in order, then, in this presentive 
consciousness, to perform the steps of thinking which the “insight,” 
the originary givenness of the predicatively formed eidetic affair- 
complex explicitly set down by that proposition, requires. That 
something actual in space corresponds to truths of that sort is not a mere 
fact; instead, it is an eidetic necessity as a particularization of eidetic 
laws. Only the actual thing itself, to which the application is made, is 
a m atter of fact here.
§7. Sciences of Matters of Fact and Eidetic Sciences.
The ground for a corresponding interrelation between sciences of 
matters of fact and eidetic sciences is the connection (itself eidetic) 
obtaining between individual object and essence, according to which 
an essential composition belongs to each individual object as its
19Insertion in Copy A: and variation.

essence20 — just as, conversely, to each essence there correspond 
possible individua which would be its factual singularizations. There 
are pure eidetic sciences such as pure logic, pure mathematics, and the 
pure theories of time, space, motion, and so forth. Throughout, in 
every step of their thinking, they are pure of all positings of matters of 
fact; or, equivalently: in them no experience, as experience, that is, as a 
consciousness that seizes upon or posits actuality, factual existence, 
can assume thefunction of grounding. Where experience functions in them 
<17) it does not function as experience. The geometer who draws his figures 
on the board produces thereby factually existing lines on the factu­
ally existing board. But his experiencing of the product, qua 
experiencing, no more grounds his geometrical seeing of essences and 
eidetic thinking than does his physical producing. This is why it does 
not m atter whether his experiencing is hallucination or whether, 
instead of actually drawing his lines and constructions, he imagines 
them in a world of phantasy. It is quite otherwise in the case of the 
scientific investigator of Nature. He observes and experiments; that is, 
he ascertains factual existence according to experienc for him experienc­
ing is a grounding act which can never be substituted by a mere 
imagining. And this is precisely why science of matters of fact and 
experiential science are equivalent concepts. But for the geometer who 
explores not actualities but “ideal possibilities,” not predicatively 
formed actuality-complexes but predicatively formed eidetic affair- 
complexes, the ultimately grounding act is not experience but rather the 
seeing of essences.
So it is in all eidetic sciences. Grounded on the predicatively 
formed eidetic affair-complexes (or the eidetic axioms), seized upon 
in immediate insight, are the mediate, predicatively formed eidetic 
affair-complexes which become given in a thinking with mediated 
insight — a thinking according to principles, all of which are objects 
of immediate insight. Consequently each step in a mediate grounding is 
apodictically and eidetically necessary. The essence of purely eidetic 
science thus consists of proceeding in an exclusively eidetic way; from 
the start and subsequently, the only predicatively formed affair- 
complexes are such as have eidetic validity and can therefore be 
either made originarily given immediately (as grounded immediate­
ly in essences originarily seen) or else can become “inferred” from
20 
Marginal note in Copy A opposite thefirst part of this sentence: Thus essences of essences make their 
appearance here; and the essence of individuality as individuality.

such “axiomatic” predicatively formed affair-complexes by pure 
deduction.
Connected with this is the practical ideal of exact eidetic science which, 
strictly speaking, only recent mathematics has shown how to ac­
tualize:21 it has shown how to bestow on any eidetic science the 
highest degree of rationality by reducing all of its mediate steps of 
thinking to mere subsumptions under the axioms of the particular 
eidetic province, these axioms having been assembled once for all 
and reinforced with the whole set of axioms belonging to “formal” or 
“pure”logic (in the broadest sense: mathesis universalis22) — unless, of 
course, from the very beginning it is a m atter of that logic itself.
And in this connection there is also the ideal of “ mathematization” 
which, like the ideal just characterized, has great significance for the 
cognitive practice of all the “exact” eidetic disciplines23 whose entire 
stock of cognitions (as in geometry, for example) is included in the 
universality of a few axioms with purely deductive necessity. But this 
is not the place to go into that.24
§8. Relationships of Dependence Between Science of Matters of Fact and 
Eidetic Science.
After the foregoing it is clear that the sense of eidetic science necessarily 
precludes any incorporation of cognitional results yielded by empirical sciences. 
The positings of actuality that occur in the immediate findings of 
these sciences obviously extend throughout all of their mediate 
findings. From matters of fact nothing ever follows but matters of 
fact.
But although every eidetic science is necessarily independent of 
every science of matters of fact, the reverse holds, on the other hand, 
for the latter sciences. There is no science of matters offact which, were it 
fully developed as a science, could be pure of eidetic cognitions and 
therefore could be independent of the formal or the material eidetic sciences. 
For, in the first place, it is without question that an experiential

<18>

science, wherever it brings about mediate grounding of judgments, 
must proceed according to the formal principles treated by formal 
logic. Since, like any other science, an experiential science is directed 
to objects, it must be universally bound by the laws that belong to the 
essence of anything objective whatever. It thereby enters into a relation 
with the complex ot formal-ontological disciplines which, besides 
formal logic in the narrower sense, embraces the other disciplines of 
“mathesis universalis” (for example arithmetic, pure analysis, theory o f 
multiplicities). Moreover, in the second place, any matter of fact 
includes a material essential composition; and any eidetic truth be­
longing to the pure essences comprised in that composition must 
yield a law by which the given factual singularity, like any other 
possible singularity, is bound.
<19) §9. Region and Regional Eidetics.
Any concrete empirical objectivity finds its place within a highest 
material genus, a “region,” of empirical objects. To the pure re­
gional essence, then, there corresponds a regional eidetic science or, as we 
can also say, a regional ontology. In this connection we assume that 
the regional essence, or the different genera composing it, are the 
basis for such abundant and highly ramified cognitions that, with 
respect to their systematic explication, it is indeed worth speaking of 
a science or of a whole complex of ontological disciplines correspond­
ing to the single generic components of the region. We shall be able to 
convince ourselves amply of the great extent to which this presup­
position is in fact fulfilled. According to what we were saying, any 
empirical science belonging to the extension of a region will be 
essentially related not only to the formal but also to the regional, 
ontological disciplines. We can also express this as follows: Any science 
of matters of fact (any experiential science) has essential theoretical 
foundations in eidetic ontologies. For (in case the assumption made is 
correct) it is quite obvious that the abundant stock of cognitions 
relating in a pure, an unconditionally valid manner to all possible 
objects of the region — in so far as these cognitions belong partly to 
the empty form of any objectivity whatever and partly to the regional 
Eidos which, as it were, exhibits a necessary material form of all the 
objects in the region — cannot lack significance for the exploration of 
empirical facts.

In this m anner there corresponds, e.g., to all the disciplines com­
prised in natural science, the eidetic science of any physical Nature 
whatever (the ontology of Nature), since there corresponds to de facto 
Nature an Eidos that can be apprehended purely, the “essence” Any 
Nature Whatever, with an infinite abundance of predicatively formed 
eidetic affair-complexes included in the latter. If we fashion the idea of 
a perfectly rationalized experiential science of Nature, i.e., one so far 
advanced in its theorization that every particular included in it has 
been traced back to that particular’s most universal and essential 
grounds, then it is clear that the realization of that idea essentially depends on 
the elaboration of the corresponding eidetic sciences; that is to say, it depends 
not only on the elaboration offormal mathesis, which is related in one <20) 
and the same m anner to all sciences taken universally, but especially 
on the elaboration of those disciplines of material ontology which 
explicate with rational purity, i.e., eidetically, the essence of Nature 
and therefore the essences of all essential sorts of natural objectivities 
as such. And obviously that holds for any other region.
Also with regard to cognitive practice it is to be expected beforehand 
that the closer an experiential science comes to the “rational” level, 
the level of “exact,” of nomological science — thus the higher the 
degree to which an experiential science is provided with developed 
eidetic disciplines as its fundamentals and utilizes them for its C og­
nitive) groundings — the greater will become the scope and power of 
its cognitive-practical performance.
This is confirmed by the development of the rational natural 
sciences, the physical sciences of Nature. Their great era began in the 
modern age precisely when the geometry which had already been 
highly developed as a pure eidetics in antiquity (and chiefly in the 
Platonic school) was all at once made fruitful in the grand style for 
the method of physics. People made clear to themselves that the 
material thing is essentially res extensa and that geometry is therefore the 
ontological discipline relating to an essential moment of material thinghood, 
namely the spatial form. But, in addition, people also made it clear to 
themselves that the universal (in our terminology, the regional) 
essence of the material thing extends much further. This is shown by 
the fact that the development followed at the same time along the line 
that led to the elaborating of a series of new disciplines coordinate 
with geometry and called on to perform the same function, that of rationaliz­
ing the empirical. The magnificent flowering of the formal and material 
mathematical sciences sprang from this aim. With passionate zeal

these sciences were developed, or newly constructed, as purely “ra­
tional” sciences (as eidetic ontologies in our sense), and indeed (in the 
beginnings of the modern age and for a long time after) not for their 
own sake but for the sake of the empirical sciences. They then 
abundantly bore the hoped-for fruits in the parallel development of 
that much-admired science, rational physics.
§10. Region and Category. The Analytic Region and its Categories.
If we put ourselves in the position of an investigator in any eidetic 
<21) science, e.g., the ontology of Nature, we find that (indeed, that is the 
normal case) we are directed not to essences as objects but to objects 
subsumed under essences which, in our example, are subordinate to 
the region Nature. In this connection, we observe, however, that 
“object” is a name for various formations which nonetheless belong 
together — for example, “physical thing,” “property,” “ relation­
ship,” “predicatively formed affair-complex,” “aggregate,” “orde­
red set.” Obviously they are not on a par with one another but rather 
in every case point back to one kind of objectivity that, so to speak, 
takes precedence as the primal objectivity, whereas all the others offer 
themselves as, in a way, merely its modifications. Naturally in our 
example the physical thing itself takes this precedence in contra­
distinction to the physical property, the physical relationship, etc. 
But precisely this is part of that formal structure which must undergo 
clarification if the terms “object” and “object-region” are not to 
remain in a state of confusion. From that clarification, to which we 
devote the following observations, the important concept of category, 
related to the concept of region, will automatically result.
O n the one hand, category is a word which, in the phrase “category 
of a region,” points back precisely to the region in question, e.g., to the 
region Physical Nature. On the other hand, however, it relates the 
particular determined material region to the form of any region whatever 
or, equivalently, to the formal essence of any object whatever and to the 
“formal categories” pertaining to this essence.
Let us begin with a not unimportant remark. At first formal 
ontology seems to be coordinate with material ontologies provided 
that the formal essence of any object whatever and the regional 
essences seem to play like roles <in formal ontology and in the regional

ontologies respectively). One is therefore inclined to speak not 
simply of regions, as we have up to now, but instead of material 
regions and now, in addition, of the “formal region ” If we accept this 
manner of speaking, we must be rather cautious. On the one side 
stand material essences; and in a certain sense they are the “essences 
proper ” But on the other side there stands something that is indeed 
eidetic but which, nevertheless, differs in its fundamental essence: a 
mere essenceform, which is indeed an essence but completely “empty”, 
an essence that, in the manner pertaining to an empty form, jits all possible 
essences; it is an essence which, with its formal universality, has all 
material universalities, even the highest of them, under it and pre­
scribes laws for them by virtue of the formal truths pertaining to its 
formal universality. Therefore the so-called “formal region” is, after all, 
not something co-ordinate with the material regions (the regions <22) 
simpliciter); properly it is not a region but the empty form of any region 
whatever; all the regions, with all their materially filled eidetic par­
ticularizations stand, not alongside it, but under it — though only 
formally. This subordination of the material to the formal is shown 
by the circumstance thatformal ontology contains theforms of all ontologies 
(scL all ontologies “proper,” all “ m aterial”ontologies) and prescribes 
for material ontologies aformal structure common to them all— including 
that structure which we must now study with a view to the distinction 
between region and category.
Let us start from formal ontology (always as pure logic in its full 
extent as mathesis universalis) which, as we know, is the eidetic 
science of any object whatever. Anything and everything is an object 
in the sense proper to formal ontology, and an infinity of various 
truths, distributed among the many disciplines of mathesis, can be 
established for it. But they all lead back to a small stock of immediate 
or “fundamental” truths which function as “axioms” in the disci­
plines of pure logic. We define now as logical categories or categories of the 
logical region, any object whatever: the fundamental concepts of pure logic 
which occur in those axioms — the concepts by means of which, in 
the total set of axioms, the logical essence of any object whatever 
becomes determined, or the concepts which express the uncondition­
ally necessary and constituent determinations of an object as object, 
of anything whatever in so far as it can be something at all. Because 
the purely logical, in the sense delimited by us with absolute exact­
ness, determines that concept of the “analytic”25 as contrasted with
“ a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : c f. Logische Untersuchungen, Vol. II, “Third Investigation,” §§11 ff.

the “synthetic,” which alone is important (but which is important 
fundamentally) to philosophy, we may also designate these categories 
as analytic.
Accordingly, concepts such as property, relative determination, 
predicatively formed affair-complex, relationship, identity, equal­
ity, aggregate (collection), cardinal number, whole and part, genus 
and species, and the like, are examples of logical categories. 
But the “signification-categories” the fundamental concepts belonging 
to the essence of the proposition (apophansis) — the fundamental 
<23) concepts of different kinds of propositions, proposition-members, 
and propositions-forms — also belong here. They belong here, 
moreover, according to our definition in view of the eidetic truths 
that connect “any object whatever” and “any signification what­
ever” so that, furthermore, pure signification-truths can be converted 
into pure object-truths. For that very reason “apophantic logic ” 
although it makes statements exclusively about significations, is 
nevertheless part of formal ontology in the fully comprehensive sense. 
Still one must set the signification-categories apart as a group by 
themselves and contrast them with the others as the formal objective 
categories in the pregnant sense.26
It may also be noted that by categories we can understand, on the 
one hand, the concepts in the sense of significations but, on the other 
hand the formal essences themselves which find their expression in 
those significations. For example, the “category” predicatively 
formed affair-complex, plurality, and the like, understood in the 
latter sense, is the formal Eidos any predicatively formed affair- 
complex whatever, any plurality whatever, and the like. The am ­
biguity is dangerous only as long as one has not learned to separate 
cleanly the things that must be separated throughout: “significat­
ion” and that which can undergo “expression” by signification; and, 
again, signification and signified objectivity. Terminologically one

formal-ontological categories, cf. Logische Untersuchungen, Vol. I, §67 [Logical Investigations,

part. At that time I did not venture to take over the expression “ontology” which was 
objectionable on historical grounds; rather I designated this investigation (p. 222 of the first 
edition) as part of an “ apriorische Theorie der Gegenstande als solchery> [“apriori theory of objects as

| “objcct-theory” ]. Now that times have changed, however, I consider it more correct to 
rehabilitate the old expression, “ontology.”

can distinguish between categorial concepts (as significations) and 
categorial essences.
§11. Syntactical Objectivities and Ultimate Substrates. Syntactical Categories.
In the realm of any objectivities whatever there is need now of an 
important distinction that is mirrored within the theory of the 
forms of significations by the (“pure-grammatical” ) distinction be­
tween “syntactical forms” and “syntactical substrates” or “stuffs.”
As a consequence, a separation of the categories of formal ontology 
into syntactical categories and substrate-categories makes itself known; and <24) 
this separation will now be discussed in greater detail.
By syntactical objectivities we mean objects derived from other ob­
jectivities by means of “syntacticalforms ” The categories correspond­
ing to these forms we shall call syntactical categories. Among them 
belong, for instance, categories such as predicatively formed affair- 
complexes,. relationship, condition or quality, unit, plurality, car­
dinal number, ordered set, ordinal number, etc. The eidetic situation 
obtaining here may be described as follows: Every object, in so far as 
it can be explicated, related to other objects or, in short, logically 
determined, takes on various syntactical forms; as correlates of the 
determining thinking, objectivities of a higher level become con­
stituted; conditions, or qualities, and objects determined by con­
ditions or qualities, relationships between some objects or other, 
pluralities of units, members of ordered sets, objects as bearers of 
ordinal numerical determinations, etc. If the thinking is predicative, 
there accrue, step by step, expressions and relevant apophantic 
signification-formations which mirror the syntactical objectivities 
with respect to all the articulations and forms of the latter, in precisely 
corresponding significational syntaxes. Like any other objectivities, 
all those “categorial objectivities”27 can function as substrates of 
categorial formations w hich, in turn, can do the same, etc. Converse­
ly, every such formation evidently refers back to ultimate substrates, to 
objects of a first or lowest level; i.e., to objects which are no longer 
syntactical-categorial formations, which no longer contain any of those 
ontological forms which are mere correlates of the thinking functions
^ a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : Cf. Logische Untersuchungen, Vol. II, “Sixth Investigation,” Part 2, 
particularly §46f. \Logical Investigations, pp. 786AT.]

(predicating, denying a predicate, relating, connecting, countings, 
etc.). Accordingly the formal region, any objectivity whatever, is 
divided into ultimate substrates and syntactical objectivities. The 
latter we shall call syntactical derivatives28 of the corresponding sub­
strates, among which, as we shall soon hear, all “individuals” belong. 
When we speak of an individual property, an individual relationship, 
etc., naturally we call these derivative objects <“individual” > on 
behalf of the substrates from which they are derived.
The following should also be noted. One reaches the ultimate, 
syntactically formless substrates likewise from the standpoint of the 
theory of forms of significations: Any proposition or any possible 
<25) member of a proposition contains, as the substrates of its apophantic 
forms, its so-called “ terms.” These can be terms in a merely relative 
sense; that is to say, they can themselves contain forms (e.g., the 
plural form, attributives, etc.29). But in every case we get back — 
necessarily — to ultimate terms, ultimate substrates, which contain no 
syntactical formation at all.30,31
§ 12. Genus and Species.
We now need a new group of categorial distinctions pertaining to the 
whole sphere of essences. Each essence, whether materially filled or

empty32 (thus, purely logical), has its place in a hierarchy of essences, 
in a hierarchy of generality and specificity. This series necessarily has 
two limits which never coincide. Descending, we arrive at the infimae 
species or, as we also say, the eidetic singularities; ascending through the 
specific and generic essences, we arrive at a highest genus. Eidetic 
singularities are essences which necessarily have over them “more 
universal” essences as their genera, but do not have under them any 
particularizations in relation to which they would themselves be 
species (either proximate species or mediate, higher, genera). In like 
fashion, that genus is the highest which has no genus over it.
In this sense, within the realm of pure logic which is made up of 
significations, the highest genus is “any signification whatever;” each 
determinate proposition-form, and each determinate form of a pro- 
position-member, is an eidetic singularity; any proposition whatever 
is an intermediate genus. In the same fashion, any cardinal number 
whatever is a highest genus. Two, three, etc. are its infimae species or 
eidetic singularities. In the sphere of materially filled essences we find 
as examples of highest genera any physical thing whatever and any 
sensuous quality, any spatial shape, and any mental process what­
ever; the eidetic compositions belonging to the determinate physical 
things and to the determinate sensuous qualities, spatial shapes, and 
mental processes, as qualities, shapes, and processes, are eidetic and 
accordingly materially filled singularities.
These eidetic relationships designated by Genus and Species (not 
the relationships among classes, i.e., sets) are such that, in the <26) 
particular essence, the more universal essence is “immediately or 
mediately c o n ta in e d — in a determined sense, the character of 
which can be seized upon in eidetic intuition. For that reason many 
investigators include the relationship of an eidetic genus or species to 
its eidetic particularization among the relationships of “ part” to 
“whole.” “Whole and part” then expresses the broadest concept of 
“that which contains and that which is contained,” of which the 
eidetic species-relationship is a particularity. The eidetically singular 
essence [eidetisch Singulare] thus implies collectively the universals 
lying above it and which, for their part, level by level, ‘lie one inside 
another,” the higher always lying inside the lower.

§13. Generalization and Formalization.
One must sharply distinguish the relationships belonging to gen­
eralization and specialization from the essentially heterogeneous 
relationships belonging, on the one hand, to the universalization of 
something materially filled into the formal in the sense of pure logic and, on 
the other hand, to the converse: the materialization of something 
logically formal. In other words: generalization is something totally 
different from that formalization which plays such a large role in, e.g., 
mathematical analysis; and specialization is something totally differ­
ent from de-formalization, from “filling out” an empty logico-mathe- 
matical form or a formal truth.
Accordingly, the subordinating of an essence to the formal univers­
ality of a pure-logical essence must not be mistaken for the subordinat­
ing of an essence to its higher essential genera. Thus, e.g., the essence, 
triangle, is subordinate to the summum genus, Spatial Shape; and 
the essence, red, to the summum genus, Sensuous Quality. On the 
other hand, red, triangle and similarly all other essences, whether 
homogeneous or heterogeneous, are subordinate to the categorial 
heading “essence” which, with respect to all of them, by no means 
has the characteristic of an essential genus; it rather does not have that 
characteristic relative to any of them. To regard “essence” as the 
genus of materially filled essences would be just as wrong as to 
misinterpret any object whatever (the empty Something) as the 
genus with respect to objects of all sorts and, therefore, naturally as 
simply the one and only summum genus, the genus of all genera. On 
the contrary, all the categories of formal ontology must be designated 
as eidetic singularities that have their summum genus in the essence, 
“any category whatever of formal ontology.”
It is clear, similarly, that any determinate inference, e.g., one 
ancillary to physics, is a singularization of a determinate purely 
<27) logical form of inference, that any determinate proposition in physics 
is a singularization of a propositional form, and the like. The pure 
forms, however, are not genera relatively to the materially filled 
propositions or inferences, but are themselves only infimae species, 
namely of the purely logical genera, proposition, inference, which, 
like all similar genera, have as their absolutely highest genus “any 
signification whatever.”34 The filling out of an empty logical form
34Substitution in Copy D for signification: syntagma. Marginal note in Copy D: Signification, 
signification-categories: that is in need of greater precision.

(and mathesis universalis includes nothing but empty forms) is 
therefore an “operation” entirely different in contrast to genuine 
specialization down to the infimae species. This can be ascertained 
throughout; thus, e.g., the transition from space to “ Euclidean 
manifold” is not a generalization but a “formal” universalization.
To verify this radical separation we must, as in all such cases, go 
back to eidetic intuition which at once teaches us that logical form- 
essences (e.g., the categories) are not “inherent” in the materially 
filled singularizations in the same manner in which the universal, 
red, is “inherent” in the different nuances of red, or in which 
“color” is inherent in red or blue, and that they are not, in the proper 
sense, “in” the materially filled singularizations at all — i.e., not in 
any sense that would have enough in common with the usual narrow 
sense of a part-relationship to justify speaking of a containedness.
No detailed exposition is needed to show, likewise, that the sub­
sumption of an individual, of any This-here, under an essence (a 
subsumption whose characteristic varies and depends on whether an 
infima species or a genus is involved) must not be mistaken for the 
subordination of an essence to its higher species or to a genus.
In the same way we shall merely indicate the changing use of the 
word extensions, especially with reference to the function of essences in 
the universal judgm ent — a use which obviously must be differ­
entiated in accord with the differences just explained. Any essence 
which is not an infima species has an35 eidetic extension, an extension 
made up of specificities and always ultimately of eidetic singularities. 
Any formal essence has, on the other hand, its formal or “mathemat­
icalextension. Furthermore, any essence whatever has its extension of 
individual singularizations, an ideal sum-total of possible This-heres 
to which it can be related in cidctically universal thinking. The 
phrase, empirical extension, indicates more than that: namely, the 
restriction to a sphere offactual being by virtue of a combined positing 
of factual being annulling the pure universality. All this is transferred, 
naturally, from essences to “concepts” as significations.
§14. Substrate-categories. The Substrate-essence and the Todi Ti.
We note further the distinction between “full,” “ materially filled” 
substrates, with the correspondingly “full,” “materially filled” syn-
35Insertion in Copy D: materially filled.

tactical objectivities, and empty substrates with the syntactical ob­
jectivities formed out of them, the variants of the empty Something. 
The latter class is itself by no means empty or poverty-stricken; it is 
determined, that is to say, as the totality of the predicatively formed 
affair-complexes belonging to the realm of pure logic as mathesis 
universalis, with all the categorial objectivities out of which they are 
constructed. Thus every predicatively formed affair-complex expres­
sed by some syllogistic or arithmetical axiom or theorem, every form 
of inference, every number, every numerical formation, every funct­
ion in pure analysis, and every Euclidean or non-Euclidean manifold 
well-defined, belongs in this class.
If we now concentrate on the class of materially filled objectivities, 
we arrive at ultimate materially filled substrates as the cores of all syntact­
ical formations. The substrate-categories belong to these cores and find 
their place under the two disjunctive main headings: “materially filled 
ultimate essence” and “ This here!” or pure, syntactically formless, 
individual single particular. The term individuum, which suggests 
itself here, is unsuitable because, no m atter how it might be defined, 
the indivisibility that the word connotes should not be admitted into 
the concept “This here!” but rather must be reserved for the part­
icular and quite indispensible concept individuum. Consequently, 
we take over the Aristotelian expression tode ti which, at least accord­
ing to the wording, does not include that sense.
We have contrasted the formless ultimate essence and the This- 
here. Now we must ascertain the essential connection obtaining 
between them, which consists of each This-here having its materially 
filled essential composition characterized by a substrate-essence that 
is formless in the sense stated.
§15. Selfsufficient and Non-self sufficient Objects. Concretum and Individuum.
Yet another basic distinction is needed: that between self sufficient and 
non-selfsujficient objects. For example, a categorial form is non­
selfsufficient in so far as it necessarily refers back to a substrate whose 
form it is. Substrate and form are referred to one another and are 
<29) unthinkable “without each other.” In this broadest sense, a purely 
logical form is thus non-selfsufficient; e.g., the categorial form, 
object, is non-selfsufficient with respect to all object-materials, the 
category, essence, is non-selfsufficient with respect to all determinate

essences; and so forth. Let us now set aside these non-selfsufficiences 
and relate a pregnant concept of non-selfsufficiency or selfsufficiency 
to concatenated “contents” proper, to relations of “containedness,” 
“unity ” and perchance “connectedness” in a more proper sense.
O f particular interest here is the situation with the ultimate sub­
strates and, still more narrowly conceived, with materially filled 
substrate-essences. Two possibilities arise for them: either one such 
substrate-essence grounds with another substrate-essence the unity 
of one essence, or it does not do so. In the first case, we arrive at 
relationships, to be described more precisely, which are perhaps of 
unilateral or reciprocal non-selfsufficiency; and with respect to eide­
tic and individual single particulars falling under united essences, we 
arrive at the apodictically necessary consequence that single part­
iculars falling under one essence cannot exist without being deter­
mined by essences which at least share a generic community with 
that of the other essences.36 37 E.g., sensuous quality necessarily refers 
to some species or other of spread; spread is, again, necessarily the 
spread of some quality united with it, “covering” it. A moment, 
“enhancement,” e.g., under the category of intensity, is only possible 
as immanent in a qualitative content, and a content subsumed under 
such a (qualitative) genus is, in turn, not thinkable without some 
degree or other of enhancement. As a mental process of a certain 
generic determinateness, an appearing is impossible except as an 
appearing of something “apparent, as apparent;” and, likewise, the 
converse holds. And so forth.
As a result, we arrive at important definitions of the formal 
categorial concepts of individuum, concretum and abstractum. A 
non-selfsufficient essence is called an abstractum, an absolutely 
selfsuflicient essence a concretum. A This-here, the material essence of 
which is a concretum, is called an individuum.38
If we now comprehend the “operation” of generalization under 
the now broadened concept of logical “variation,”39 then we can say
J6a i;t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : Cf. the detailed analyses of the Logische (Jntersuchungen, Vol. II, “Third 
Investigation,” especially in the somwhat improved presentation of the new edition (1913).

Investigation” I chiefly drew upon the restriction to relationships of inexistence “proper.”

that the individuum is the primal object required by pure logic, the 
(30) absolute of10 logic back to which all logical variants refer.41
A concretum is obviously an eidetic singularity because species 
and genera (expressions which ordinarily exclude the infima species) 
are non-selfsufficient on principle. Eidetic singularities are divided into 
abstract and concrete.
Eidetic singularities included discretely [disjunktiv] in a concretum 
are necessarily “heterogeneous” in view of the formal-ontological 
law that two eidetic singularities of one and the same genus cannot be 
combined into the unity of one essence;42 or, as we also say: the infimae 
species of a genus are mutually “incompatible.” Accordingly, every 
singularity finding a place in a concretum, seen as an infima species, 
leads to a separated system of species and genera, thus also to 
separated summa genera. For instance, in the unity of a phenomenal 
thing the determinate shape leads to the summum genus of any 
spatial shape whatever, a determinate color to any visual quality 
whatever. Nonetheless, the infimae species in a concretum, instead of 
being discrete, can also be so related that one is comprehended in the 
other. For example, physical properties presuppose and include in 
themselves spatial determinations. In that case, the summa genera 
too are not, then, discrete,.
As a further consequence, the genera are divided in characteristic 
and fundamental ways into those genera having concreta, <as in­
fimae species,) under them, and into those having abstracta under 
them. For the sake of convenience we speak of concrete and abstract 
genera despite the double sense which the adjectives now acquire. 
Obviously no one would be inclined to take concrete genera them­
selves for concreta in the original sense. Where precision demands it, 
however, the unwieldly expression “genera” must be used respec­
tively of concreta and of abstracta. Examples of concrete genera are 
real thing, visual phantom (sensuously filled appearing visual 
shape), mental process and the like. In contrast, spatial shape, visual 
quality and the like are examples of abstract genera.

§16. Region and Category in the Materially Filled Sphere. Synthetical Cogni­
tions A Priori.
Moreover, with the concepts individuum and concretum the concept 
of region, fundamental to the theory of science, is defined in a strictly 
“analytical” way. A region is nothing other than the total highest 
generic unity belonging to a concretum, i.e., the essentially unitary nexus of 
the summa genera pertaining to the infimae species within the <31) 
concretum. The eidetic extension of the region comprises the ideal 
totality of concretely unified complexes of infimae species belonging 
to these genera; the individual extension comprises the ideal totality 
of possible individua having such concrete essences.
Each regional essence determines “synthetical” eidetic truths, that is to 
say, truths that are grounded in it as this generic essence, but that are not mere 
particularizations of truths included in formal ontology. Accordingly, 
neither the regional concept nor any of its regional specifications is 
freely variable in these synthetical truths; the substitution of indeter­
minate terms for the related determinate ones does not yield a law of 
formal ontology, as it does, in characteristic fashion, in the case of any 
“analytic” necessity. The set of synthetical truths grounded in the 
regional essence makes up the content of the regional ontology. The 
total set o(fundamental truths among them, the regional axioms, delimits
— and defines for us — the set of regional categories. These concepts do 
not, like all concepts, merely express particularizations of the 
categories of pure logic, but rather are distinguished by the fact that 
they express, by virtue of the regional axioms, that which is peculiar to 
the regional essence or, correlatively, express with eidetic universality 
that which must belong, “a priori” and “synthetically,” to an individual object 
within the extension of the region. Though such concepts do not belong to 
pure logic, their application to given individuals is apodictically and 
unconditionally necessary; it is governed, moreover, by the regional 
(synthetical) axioms.
In order to retain the allusions to K ant’s critique of reason (in spite 
of considerable differences in the fundamental conceptions, although 
the differences do not exclude a basic affinity), one would have to 
understand by synthetical cognitions a priori the regional axioms; and we 
should have as many irreducible classes of such cognitions as we have 
regions. The “ synthetical fundamental concepts” or categories, would be 
the regional fundamental concepts (essentially related to the deter­
minate region and its synthetical fundamental laws or principles);

and we should have as many different groups of categories as there are 
regions to differentiate.
At the same time formal ontology takes its place outwardly alongside 
the regional (the proper “material ” “synthetical”) ontologies. Its re- 
<32) gional concept, “object” (cf. §10 above), determines the system of 
formal axioms and, through them, the set of formal (“analytical” ) 
categories. In this fact there indeed lies a justification for regarding 
(formal ontology and the material ontologies) as parallel in spite of all 
the essential differences which have been emphasized.
§17. Conclusion of Our Logical Considerations.
O ur whole consideration has been a purely logical one; it has not 
moved in any “ m aterial” sphere nor, as we may say equivalently, in 
any determinate region. It has spoken universally of regions and 
categories; and this universality, according to the sense of the de­
finitions we have built one upon another, has been a purely logical 
universality. It has been our purpose to outline, on the basis of pure logic 
and as part of the fundamental structure of all possible cognition or cognitive 
objectivities proceeding from pure logic, a schema in conformity with which 
individua must be determinable under “synthetical principles a priori” according 
to concepts and laws, or in conformity with which all empirical sciences 
must be grounded on the regional ontologies which are relevant to them and not 
merely on the pure logic common to all sciences.
At the same time, from here on the idea of a task arises: Within the 
circle ofour intuitions of individuals, to determine the summa genera of 
concretions and, in this manner, to effect a distribution of all intuited 
individual being according to regions of being, each of which marks off an eidetic 
and empirical science (or group of sciences) that is necessarily distinct from 
other sciences because it is distinguished from them on the most 
radical eidetic grounds. The radical distinction, we may add, in no 
way excludes an interweaving or a partial overlapping of the 
sciences. Thus, for example, “material thing” and “psyche” are 
different regions of being, and yet the latter is founded on the former; 
and out of that fact arises the fact that psychology is founded on 
somatology.
The problem of a radical “classification” of the sciences is, in the 
main, the problem of separating regions; and this, in turn, requires 
antecedent investigations in pure logic like those which were con­
ducted here along some lines. On the other side, to be sure, a 
phenomenology is also required — of which we still know nothing.

§ 18. Introduction to the Critical Discussions.
In contrast to matters of fact and the science of matters of fact, the 
universal statements about essence and the science of essences deal in 
advance with the essential foundations for our construction of the 
idea of a pure phenomenology (which, according to the “ Introduct­
ion,” should develop as a science of essences) as well as for the 
understanding of its position relative to all empirical sciences and, 
therefore, relative to psychology in particular. But much depends on 
all of our essential determinations being understood in the correct 
sense. In them, let it be sharply emphasized, we were not arguing 
from pregiven philosophical standpoints; nor did we use traditional 
philosophical doctrines, not even those which may be universally 
acknowledged. Instead, we carried out some essentially necessary clarifi­
cations in the strictest sense, i.e., we only gave faithful expression to 
(eidetic) differences that are directly given to us in intuition. We took 
the differences precisely as they are given in intuition, without any 
hypothetical or interpretative explication, without reading into 
them anything which may be suggested to us by traditional theories 
ot ancient or modern times. The findings thus made are actual 
“beginnings;” and if, like ours, they have a universality related to the 
comprehensive regions of being, then they are assuredly essentially 
necessary in the philosophical sense and themselves belong to philo­
sophy. But this latter, too, is something which we need not presup­
pose; our previous as well as our future considerations should be free 
from any relation of dependence on a “science” so contested and 
suspect as philosophy. In our fundamental findings we have presup­
posed nothing, not even the concept of philosophy, and thus we shall 
also proceed in the future. Formulated explicitly, the philosophical

frio/Tl1 that we are undertaking shall consist of our completely abstaining 
from any judgment regarding the doctrinal content of any previous philosophy 
and effecting all of our demonstrations within the limits set by this abstention. 
On the other hand, therefore, we need not and cannot avoid speak­
ing of philosophy as a historical fact, otde facto philosophical lines of 
<34) thought which have determined, for good and often for ill, the 
general scientific convictions of mankind and done so particularly 
with respect to the basic points treated here.
Precisely in this connection we must enter into a controversy with 
empiricism; but because it involves points that admit of being as­
certained immediately, it is a controversy which we can very easily 
settle while maintaining our fercox'fl. If philosophy has any stock 
whatever of “essentially necessary” fundamentals in the genuine 
sense which, according to their essence, can therefore be grounded 
only by an immediately presentive intuition, then the controversy 
concerning them is decided not only independently of any philosoph­
ical science, but of the idea of such a science and of the latter’s 
allegedly legitimated theoretical content. The situation forcing the 
controversy upon us is that “ideas,” “essences,” “cognition of es­
sence,” are denied by empiricism. This is not the place to develop the 
historical reasons why precisely the trium phant advance of the 
natural sciences — however much, as “ mathematical,” they owe 
their high scientific level to the laying of eidetic foundations — has 
favored philosophical empiricism and made it the predominant 
conviction, indeed, almost the solely dominant one among empirical 
investigators. In any case, among empirical investigators, and there­
fore among psychologists, hostility to ideas prevails that eventually 
must endanger the progress of the experiential sciences themselves 
because, owing to this hostility, the still uncompleted eidetic found­
ing of these sciences and the perhaps necessary constituting of new 
eidetic sciences indispensible to their progress have become inhi­
bited. As will be clearly shown later on, what has just been said 
directly concerns phenomenology which2 makes up the necessary 
eidetic foundations of psychology and the cultural sciences. Some­
thing must be said, therefore, in defense of our findings.

§19. The Empiricistic Identification of Experience and the Onginarily Pre­
sently e Act.
As we must acknowledge, empiricistic naturalism springs from the 
most praise worthy motives. In contrast to all “idols,” to the powers 
of tradition and superstition, of crude and refined prejudices of every 
sort, it is a radicalism of cognitive practice that aims at enforcing the 
right of autonomous reason as the sole authority on questions of 
truth. But to judge rationally or scientifically about things signifies to <35) 
conform to the things themselves or to go from words and opinions back 
to the things themselves, to consult them in their self-givenness and to 
set aside all prejudices alien to them. Only another mode of expression for 
just this — so the empiricist believes — is that all science must proceed 
from experience, must ground its mediate cognition on immediate 
experience. The empiricist therefore takes genuine science and 
experiential science to be identical. When contrasted with matters of 
fact, what are “ideas,” “essences,” but Scholastic entities, metaphys­
ical spectres? To have freed mankind from any such philosophical 
phantom is held to be the chief merit of modern natural science. All 
science, it is alleged, only deals with experienceable, real actuality. 
W hatever is not actuality is imagination; and a science based on 
imaginings is just an imagined science. Naturally, one will allow 
imaginings as psychical facts; they belong to psychology. But what 
we tried to show in the preceding chapter was that by virtue of a so- 
called eidetic seeing based on imaginings there spring from the 
imaginings new data, “eidetic” data, objects that are irreal [ irrealj.
But that, so the empiricist will conclude, isjust “ideological excess,” a 
“reversion to Scholasticism” or to those “speculative constructions a 
priori” in the first half on the nineteenth century by which an 
idealism, alienated from natural science, so greatly hampered genu­
ine science.
However, everything said here by the empiricist is based on 
misunderstandings and prejudices — no m atter how well meant or 
how good the motive which originally guided him. The essential 
fault in empiricistic argumentation consists of identifying or confus­
ing the fundamental demand for a return to the “ things themselves” 
with the demand for legitimation of all cognition by experience. With 
his comprehensible naturalistic constriction of the limits bounding 
cognizable “ things,” the empiricist simply takes experience3 to be the

only act that is presentive of things themselves. But things are not 
simply mere things belonging to Nature, nor is actuality in the usual 
sense simply all of actuality; and that originarily presentive act which 
we4 call experience5 relates only to actuality in Nature. To make identificat- 
<36) ions here and treat them as supposed truisms is blindly to push aside 
differences which can be given in the clearest insight. The question 
therefore is: Which side is prejudiced? Genuine freedom from pre­
judice only demands a rejection of “judgments alien to experience” 
when the proper sense of the judgments demands their legitimation by 
experience. Simply to assert that ^//judgments admit of, indeed even 
demand, legitimation by experience without having previously sub­
mitted the essence of judgments to a study with respect their funda­
mentally different species and without having, in so doing, con­
sidered whether that assertion is not ultimately countersensical: that is 
a “speculative construction a priori” made no better by the fact that it 
happens to issue from the empiricistic camp. Genuine science and its 
own genuine freedom from prejudice require, as the foundation of all 
proofs, immediately valid judgments which derive their validity from 
originally presentive intuitions. The latter, however, are of such a charac­
ter as prescribed by the sense of the judgments, or correlatively by the 
proper essence of the predicatively formed judgment-complex. The funda­
mental regions of object and, correlatively, the regional types of 
presentive intuitions, the relevant types ofjudgments, and finally the 
noetic norms that demand for the establishment ofjudgments belong­
ing to a particular type just this and no other species of intuition: 
none of that can be postulated or decreed from on high. One can only 
ascertain them by insight; and, as before, that signifies disclosing 
them by originally presentive intuition and fixing them by judg­
ments which are faithfully fitted to what is given in such intuition. It 
seems to us that that is how the procedure actually free from pre­
judice, or purely objective, would look.
Immediate “seeing”* not merely sensuous, experiential seeing, but 
seeing in the universal sense as an originally presentive consciousness of any kind 
whatever, is the ultimate legitimizing source of all rational assertions. 
This source has its legitimizing function only because, and to the 
extent that, it is an originally presentive source. If we see an object 
with full clarity, if we have effected an explication and a conceptual

apprehension purely on the basis of the seeing and within the limits of 
what is actually seized upon in seeing, if we then see (this being a new 
mode of “seeing” ) how the object is, the faithful expressive statement 
has, as a consequence, its legitimacy. Not to assign any value to “ I see 
it” as an answer to the question, “Why?” would be a countersense — 
as, yet again, we see. Moreover, as may be added here to prevent 
possible misinterpretations, that does not exclude the possibility that, <37> 
under some circumstances, one seeing conflicts with another and 
likewise that one legitimate assertion conflicts with another. For that, 
perhaps, no more implies that seeing is not a legitimizing basis than 
the outweighing ofone force by another signifies that the outweighed 
force is not a force. It does say, however, that perhaps in a certain 
category of intuitions (and that is the case precisely with sensuously 
experiencing intuitions) seeing is, according to its essence, “imper­
fect,” that of essential necessity it can become strengthened or weaken­
ed, that consequently an assertion having an immediate, and there­
fore genuine, legitimizing ground in experience nevertheless may 
have to be abandoned in the further course of experience because of a 
counter legitimacy outweighing and annulling it.
§20. Empiricism as Skepticism.
For experience we therefore substitute something more universal: 
“intuition;” and by so doing we reject the identification of science 
taken universally with experiential science. Furthermore, it is easily 
recognized that by defending this identification, and by contesting 
the validity of purely eidetic thinking, one arrives at a skepticism 
which, as genuine skepticism, cancels itself out by a countcrsense.7 
We need only ask the empiricist about the source of the validity of his 
universal theses (e.g., “All valid thinking is based upon experience as 
the only presentive intuition” ), and he becomes involved in a de­
monstrable countersense. After all, direct experience only presents 
particular singularities and no universalities; therefore it is 
insufficient. He cannot appeal to eidetic insight because he denies it; 
but surely he can then appeal to induction and thus generally to the 
whole complex of modes of mediate inference by which experiential
’a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : On the characteristic concept of skepticism, cf. the “Prolegomena z u r 
reinen Logik,” Logische Untersuchungen, I, §32 [Logical Investigations, Vol. I, pp. 135ff.]

science acquires its universal propositions. Now, we ask, what about 
the truth of mediate inferences, regardless of whether or not they are 
deductive or inductive? Is this truth8 (indeed, we could ask, is even the 
truth of a singular judgment) itself something experienceable and 
hence ultimately perceivable? And what about those principles of the 
modes of inference to which one appeals in the case of controversy or 
doubt? For example, what about the syllogistic principles, the prin­
ciple “that two things, each of which is equal to a third thing, are 
equal,” etc., to which, as ultimate sources, the justification of all 
modes of inference in such cases leads back? Are they themselves also 
empirical universalizations, or is it not the case that such a con­
ception implies a most radical countersense?
<38) 
W ithout entering here into more lengthy analyses, in which we 
would only repeat what has been said elsewhere,9 we may have made 
it at least apparent that the fundamental theses of empiricism need a 
more precise analysis, clarification and grounding; and that this 
grounding itself must square with the norms that the theses state. At 
the same time, however, there manifestly exists here at least a serious 
suspicion that a countersense is hidden in this relation to something 
antecedent — yet hardly the beginning of a serious attempt to 
produce actual clarity and a scientific grounding of the fundamental 
theses can be found in the literature of empiricism. Here, as everywhere 
else, a scientific, empirical grounding would require that we start 
from single cases strictly fixed in the manner befitting to theory, and 
proceed to universal theses employing a method illuminated by 
eidetic insight. The empiricists have apparently failed to see that 
the very scientific demands that they, in their theses, present to all 
cognitions are also addressed to those theses themselves.
As genuine standpoint-philosophcrs, and in obvious contradistin- 
tion to their principle of freedom from prejudice, the empiricists start 
from unclarified preconceived opinions whose truth has not been 
grounded. On the other hand, we take our start from what lies prior to 
all standpoints: from the total realm of whatever is itself given 
intuitionally and prior to all theorizing, from everything that one can 
immediately see and seize upon — if only one does not let himself be 
blinded by prejudices and prevented from taking into consideration

whole classes of genuine data. If “positivism” is tantamount to an 
absolutely unprejudiced grounding of all sciences on the “positive,” 
that is to say, on what can be seized upon originaliter, then we are the 
genuine positivists. In fact, we allow no authority to curtail our right 
to accept all kinds of intuition as equally valuable legitimating 
sources of cognition — not even the authority of “modern natural 
science.” When it is actually natural science that speaks, we listen 
gladly and as disciples. But it is not always natural science that speaks 
when natural scientists are speaking; and it assuredly is not when they 
are talking about “philosophy of N ature” and “epistemology as a 
natural science.” And, above all, it is not natural science that speaks 
when they try to make us believe that general truisms such as all 
axioms express (propostions such as “ a +  1 = 1 + a,” “a judgm ent <39) 
cannot be colored,” “of only two qualitatively different tones, one is 
lower and the other higher,” “ a perception is, in itself, a perception of 
something” ) are indeed expressions of experiential matters of filet; 
whereas we know with full insight that propositions such as those give 
explicative expression to data of eidetic intuition. But this very 
situation makes it clear to us that the “positivists” sometimes confuse 
the cardinal differences among kinds of intuition and sometimes 
indeed see them in contrast but, bound by their prejudices, will to 
accept only a single one of them as valid or even as existent.
§21. Obscurities on the Idealistic Side.
Obscurity in this matter, it is true, also holds sway on the opposite , 
side. More particularly, one assumes a pure, an “a priori” thinking 
and thus rejects the empiricistic thesis; but reflectively it is not 
brought to clear consciousness that there is something such as pure 
intuiting as a kind of givenness in which essences are given originarily 
as objects entirely10 in the same way that individual realities are 
given in experiential intuition; it is not recognized that every judging 
process of seeing such as, in particular, seeing unconditionally universal 
truths, likewise falls under the concept ofpresentive intuition which has many 
differentiations, above all, those that run parallel to the logical categories.11 To 
be sure, they speak of evidence; but instead of bringing it, as an act of

Likewise §3, above. [Logical Investigations, pp. 792fT]

seeing, into essential relations with ordinary seeing, they speak of a 
“feeling of evidence” which, as a mystic index veri, bestows an emotional 
coloring on the judgments. Such conceptions are possible only as 
long as one has not learned to analyze kinds of consciousness in pure 
observation and eidetically instead of theorizing about them from on 
high. These alleged feelings of evidence, of intellectual necessity or 
whatever else they may be called, are no more than theoretically 
invented feelings.12. This will be acknowledged by everyone who has 
brought any case of evidence to actually seen / schauenden / givenness 
and has compared it with a case of non-evidence of the same 
<40) judgment-content. One then immediately notes that the tacit pre­
supposition of the affective theory of evidence, namely that a judging 
which is the same with respect to the rest of its psychological essence 
appears on one occasion with affective coloring and on another 
without it, is fundamentally erroneous; and that, rather, an identical 
upper stratum, that of an identical stating, as a mere significational 
expressing, on the one occasion conforms step by step to a “clearly 
seeing” intuition of an affair-complex,13 whereas on the other occa­
sion a wholly different phenomenon, a non-intuitive, perhaps a 
wholly confused and unarticulated consciousness of an affair- 
complex functions as the lower stratum. W ith the same justice in the 
sphere of experience one could conceive the difference between the 
clear and faithful judgm ent of perception and any vaguejudgment of 
the same affair-complex as consisting merely of the former being 
endowed with a “feeling of clarity” while the latter is not.
§22. The Reproach of Platonic Realism. Essence and Concept.
Repeatedly particular offense has been caused by the fact that, as14 
“platonizing realists,” we set up ideas or essences as objects and 
ascribe to them, as to other objects, actual (veritable) being as well 
as, correlatively with this, the possibility of being seized upon by 
intuition — just as we do in the case realities. We may disregard here 
the sort of hasty reader, unfortunately rather frequent, who at-

Lehrbuch der Psychologie [Textbook of Psychology] <(Tiibingen, 1912)>, pp. 289ff., are, in my 
opinion, psychological fictions without the least foundation in the phenomena.

tributes to the author concepts of his own that are quite foreign to the 
author and who then does not find it hard to read absurdities into the 
author’s statements.15 If object and something real, actuality and real 
actuality, have one and the same sense, then the conception of ideas 
as objects and actualities is indeed a perverse “ Platonic hypo- 
statization.” But if, as in the Logische Untersuchungen, the two are 
sharply separated, if object is defined as anything at all, e.g., as 
subject of a true (categorial, affirmative) statement, what offense can 
remain — except one which stems from obscure prejudices? I did not 
invent the universal concept of object; I ojily restored the concept 
required by all propositions of pure logic and pointed out that it is an 
essentially indispensible one and therefore that it also determines 
universal scientific language. And in this sense the tone-quality c, <41) 
which is a numerically unique member of the tonal scale, the number 
two, in the series of cardinal numbers, the figure in the ideal world of 
geometrical constructs, and any propositions in the “world” of pro­
positions16 — in short, many different ideal affairs — are “objects.” 
Blindness to ideas is a kind of psychical blindness; because of pre­
judices one becomes incapable of bringing what one has in one’s field 
of intuition into one’s field of judgm ent. The truth is that all human 
beings see “ideas,” “essences,” and see them, so to speak, continu­
ously; they operate with them in their thinking, they also make 
eidetic judgments — except that from their epistemological 
standpoint they interpret them away.17 Evident data are patient; 
they let the theories pass them by, but remain what they are. It is the 
business of theories to conform to the data, and the business of 
theories of knowledge to distinguish fundamental kinds of data and 
describe such kinds with respect to their proper essences.
Prejudices make people remarkably easy to satisfy with respect to 
theories. There can be no essences and therefore no eidetic intuition 
(ideation); therefore where ordinary language contradicts this, it 
must be a m atter of “grammatical hypostatization” by which one must 
not let himself be driven to “metaphysical hypostatizations” W hat we 
have to deal with in fact can only be real psychical processes of

consequence, “ theories ofabstraction” are zealously constructed and 
psychology, so proud of being empirical, is enriched here, as in all 
intentional spheres (which, after all, make up the chief themes of 
psychology) with invented phenomena, with psychological analyses which are 
no analyses at all. Ideas or essences, it is said, are thus “concepts” and 
concepts are “ mental constructs“products of abstraction,” and, as 
such, indeed play a large part in our thinking. “Essence,” “idea” or 
Eidos:” these are but elegant “philosophical” names for “sober 
psychological facts.” They are dangerous because of their metaphys­
ical suggestions.
We answer: Certainly essences are “concepts” — if by concepts 
one understands, in so far as that ambiguous word allows, precisely 
essences. Only let one make clear to himself that then it is nonsense to 
talk about them as psychical products and likewise as concept- 
formations, provided the latter is to be understood strictly and pro­
perly.18 One occasionally reads in a treatise that the series of cardinal 
numbers is a series of concepts and then, a little further on, that 
<42) concepts are products of thinking. At first cardinal numbers them­
selves, the essences, were thus designated as concepts. But are not 
cardinal numbers, we ask, what they are regardless of whether we 
“form” or do not form them? Certainly, I frame / vollziehe / my 
numbers, form my numerical objectivations in adding “one plus 
one.”19 These numerical objectivations are now these and when I 
then form them a second time in an identical way, they are different. 
In this sense, at one time there are no numerical objectivations of one 
and the same number, at another time there are many, as many 
numerical objectivations as we please of one and the same number. 
But just with that we have made (and how can we avoid making) the 
distinction; the numerical objectivation is not the number itself, it is 
not the number two, this single member of the numerical series 
which, like all members, is an atemporal being. To designate it as a 
psychical formation is thus countersense, an offence against the sense 
ofarithmetical speech which is perfectly clear, discernible at any time 
and therefore which precedes all theory. If concepts are psychical 
formations then those affairs, such as pure numbers, are not con­
cepts. But if they are concepts, then concepts are not psychical 
formations. As a consequence, one needs new terms if only to resolve 
ambiguities as dangerous as these.

In Copy A this part of the sentence was changed to read: provided they are understood as the

§23. The Spontaneity of Ideation. Essence and Fictum.
But, one might object, is it not still true and evident that concepts or, 
if you will, essences, such as Red, House, etc., arise by abstraction 
from intuitions of something individual? And do we not at will 
construct concepts out of those already formed? Thus we do indeed 
deal with psychological products. One might even add that it is 
similar to the case of arbitrary fictions: The flute-playing centaur we 
freely imagine is precisely our objectivational formation. — Certain­
ly “concept-formation” and likewise free fiction are carried out 
spontaneously, and what is spontaneously generated is obviously a 
product of the mind. But what we arrive at with the flute-playing 
centaur is objectivation in the sense in which the objectivated is 
called objectivation, and not the sense in which objectivation is the 
name of a psychical mental process. Obviously the centaur itself is 
nothing psychical; it exists neither in the soul nor in consciousness, 
nor does it exist somewhere else; the centaur is indeed “nothing,” it is 
wholly “imagination;” stated more precisely: the mental process of 
imagining is the imagining of a centaur. To that extent the 
“supposed-centaur,” the centaur-phantasied, certainly belongs to 
the mental process itself. But one also should not confuse just this 
mental process of imagining with what is imagined by it as 
imagined.20 As a consequence, in spontaneous abstracting it is also <43) 
not the essence which is generated but instead the consciousness of the 
essence;21 and the situation for this is that, and obviously essential­
ly,22 an originary presentive consciousness of an essence (ideation) is in 
itself and necessarily spontaneous, whereas spontaneity is extraes­
sential to the sensuously presentive, the experiential consciousness: 
the individual object can “appear,” can be apprehended by con­
sciousness but without a spontaneous “activity” performed “upon” 
it. Other than those of confusion, there are, accordingly, no dis­
coverable motives which could demand the identification of con­
sciousness of essence with essence itself and which ultimately there­
fore demand the latter’s being psychologized.
Nevertheless, the parallel of feigning consciousness might still raise 
a doubt, namely with respect to the “existence” of essence. Is essence

work.
21 In Copy A, opposite this sentence: N.B.??
22Marginal note in Copy A to “essentially:” this can still be improved.

not a fiction as the skeptics would like to have it? Despite that, just as 
the parallelism of fiction and perception under the more general 
concept of “intuiting consciousness” prejudices the existence of per­
ceptually given objects, so the parallelism effected above prejudices 
the “existence” of essence. Things can be perceived and remem­
bered, and therefore there can be consciousness of them as “actual;” 
or, in modified acts there can be consciousness of things as “doubt­
ful,” null (illusory); finally, in entirely different modifications as 
well, there can be consciousness of things as “simply hovering before 
us” and hovering before us as quasi-actual, null, etc. The case is 
wholly similar with essences: like other objects they can at times be 
intended to [vermeint] correctly, at times falsely, as, e.g., in false 
geometrical thinking. The seizing upon and intuition of essences is, 
however, a complex act, specifically seeing essences is an originary 
presentive act and, as a presentive act, is the analogue of sensuous perceiving 
and not of imagining,
§24. The Principle of All Principles.
Enough now of absurd theories. No conceivable theory can make us 
err with respect to the principle of all principles: that every originary 
presentive intuition is a legitimizing source of cognition, that everything 
originarily (so to speak, in its “personal” actuality) offered to us in 
“ intuition” is to be accepted simply as what it is presented as being, but also 
<44) only within the limits in which it is presented there. We see indeed that each 
<theory) can only again draw its truth itself from orginiary data. 
Every statement which does no more than confer expression on such 
data by simple explication and by means of significations precisely 
conforming to them is, as we said at the beginning of this chapter, 
actually an absolute beginning called upon to serve as a foundation, a 
principium in the genuine sense of the word. But this holds especially 
for this kind of generical cognitions of essences to which the word 
“principle” is commonly limited.
In this sense the scientific investigator of Nature is perfectly right in 
following the “principle” that we question every assertion bearing 
upon matters of fact of Nature relative to the experience which 
grounds it. Because that is a principle, it is an assertion in so far as we 
make perfectly clear the sense of the expressions used in the principle 
and make given in purity the essences pertaining to the expressions.

But in the same sense the scientific investigator of essences, and whoever at 
any time employs and states generical propositions, must follow a 
parallel principle; and such a principle must be given because the one 
just granted, the principle of the grounding of all cognition of matters 
of fact by experience, is not itself given with insight in experience — 
as is the case with every principle and every cognition of essence 
without exception.
§25. In Praxis: The Positivist as Scientific Investigator of Nature. In Reflect­
ion: The Scientific Investigator of Nature as Positivist.
Defacto the positivist rejects eidetic cognitions only when he reflects 
“philosophically” and allows himself to be deceived by the sophisms 
of empiricistic philosophers; but he does not do any of this when, as 
scientific investigator ofNature, he thinks and grounds his thought in 
the normal, natural scientific attitude. For there he obviously lets 
himself be guided to a very wide extent by eidetic insights. It is well 
known that the basic means of natural scientific theorizing are the 
purely mathematical disciplines such as the material disciplines of 
geometry or phoronomy, the formal (purely logical) disciplines such 
as arithmetic, analysis, etc. It is manifestly clear that these disciplines 
do not proceed empirically, that they are not grounded by ob­
servation and experiments on experienced23 figures, movements, and 
so forth.
Empiricism will certainly not see this. But should one take seri­
ously its argument that far from there being too few grounding 
<45) experiences, there are, instead, an infinity of experiences at our 
command? In the collective experience of all generations of man, 
even in the generations themselves of animals preceding them, an 
immense treasure of geometrical and arithmetical impressions have 
been collected and integrated in the form of interpretational habitu- 
alities, and from out of this foundation our geometrical insights now 
are drawn. — But from where does one then know of these alleged 
collective treasures when no one has observed them scientifically and 
faithfully documented them? Since when are long forgotten and 
completely hypothetical experiences the grounds of a science — and, 
in that connection, of the most exact science — instead of actual

experiences most carefully demonstrated in their genuine experien­
tial function and range? The physicist observes and experiments and 
satisfies himself with good grounds, 
not with prescientific 
experiences, not to mention instinctive interpretations and hypo­
theses about alleged hereditary experiences.
O r should one say, as has in fact been said on other sides, that we 
owe geometrical insights to “experience in phantasy ” that we ought to 
effect them as inductions based upon experiments in phantasy? But why, we 
ask in contra, does the psysicist make no use of such marvelous 
experience in phantasy? For no other reason than because experi­
ments in the imagination are imagined experiments, just as figures, 
movements, multiplicities in phantasy are not actual but imagined 
ones.
However, in contrast to all such interpretations, instead of adopt­
ing and arguing from their basis, we take the most correct course by 
referring to the sense proper of mathematical assertions. In order to 
know, and to know without doubt, what a mathematical axiom 
states, we have to turn not to empiricistic philosophers but rather to 
that consciousness in which, in full insight, we mathematizingly seize 
upon axiomatic predicatively formed affair-complexes. If we hold 
ourselves to this intuition in purity, there is no doubt at all that pure 
essential connections are expressed without the slightest correlative 
positing of experiential matters of fact.24 One must not philosophize 
and psychologize about geometrical thinking and intuiting from 
outside instead of livingly carrying it out and determining its imma- 
nental sense on the ground of direct analysis. It may be that we have 
inherited cognitive dispositions from cognitions of past generations; 
but in so far as the question about the sense and value of our 
cognitions is concerned, the histories of these heritages are as indiffer­
ent as the history of gold is for the value of our gold.

method. This is fortunate for them. Natural science has become great 
by unhestitatingly setting aside the luxuriant growth of ancient 
skepticism and refusing to conqueror it. In place of slaving over such 
puzzling seperate questions as how cognition of an “external” 
Nature is at all possible, or how all the difficulties were to be resolved 
which the ancients had already found in this possibility, they prefer­
red to busy themselves with the question about the right method of 
cognition of Nature which can actually be carried out and which is as 
perfect as possible: cognition in the form of exact natural science. 
Having this orientation by which it acquired a free avenue for its 
material research, natural science, however, has taken half a step 
backwards again whereby it has given room to new skeptical reflections and let 
itself be limited by skeptical tendencies in its possibilitiesfor work. As a result 
of being abandoned to empiricistic prejudices, skepticism now re­
mains put out of action only with respect to the sphere of experience, but 
no longer with respect to the sphere of essence. This is because it is not 
sufficient to draw the eidetic into its circle of research under false 
empiricistic colors. Such transformations of value are tolerated only 
by eidetic disciplines, like the mathematical ones which are 
grounded in antiquity and protected by the rights of custom; whereas 
(as we have already indicated) the empiricistic prejudices must 
function with respect to the grounding of newer disciplines as 
completely effective obstacles. The right position, dogmatic in a good 
sense, that is, prephilosophicaly sphere of research in which all experiential 
sciences belong (but not only those sciences) is that position which sets 
aside with full awareness all skepticism together with all “natural philosophy” 
and “theory of knowledge” and takes cognitive objectivities where one 
actually finds them — no m atter what difficulties an epistemological 
reflection on the possibility of such objectivities may always point out 
afterwards.
Just here there is an unavoidable and important division to be 
made in the realm of scientific research. On the one side stand sciences 
of the dogmatic attitude turned toward things, unconcerned with 
epistemological or skeptical problems. They start out from the origi- <47) 
nary givenness of their things (and always again return to it in the 
demonstration of their cognitions); and they ask: As what are the 
things immediately given, and on that basis, what can be mediately 
concluded about these things and about any things whatever of the 
domain? On the other side stands scientific research peculiar to the 
epistemological, to the specifically philosophical attitude which pur-

sues the skeptical problems of the possibility of knowledge which are 
directly resolved into the universality of principles so that, by apply­
ing the solutions acquired, the consequences forjudging about the 
ultimate sense and cognitive value of the results of the dogmatic 
sciences can be drawn. In the present situation, and as long as there is 
indeed lacking a highly developed cognitive critique which succeeds 
in perfect rigor and clarity, it is at the least right to close the boundaries of 
dogmatic research to “critical” modes of inquiry. In other words, at the 
moment it appears right to us to take care that epistemological (and, 
as a rule, skeptical) prejudices — the correctness and incorrectness of 
which philosophical science has to decide, but which need not 
concern the dogmatic investigator — are not obstacles to the course 
of the dogmatic investigator’s inquiries. But it is precisely the way of 
skepticisms that they are susceptible of unfavorable obstacles of that 
kind.
Just in that connection and at the same time, the relevant situation 
is designated for the sake of which the theory of knowledge as science 
needs its own dimension. No m atter how satisfied cognition might be 
which is purely materially directed and borne by insight, as soon as it 
reflectively turns back upon itself the possibility of validity of all 
modes of cognition and, under that, even of intuitions and insights, is 
infected by confusing unclarities, by sheer, unresolvable difficulties; 
and this is especially the case with respect to the transcendence which 
cognitive Objects claim over against cognition. Just for this reason 
there are skepticisms which become prevalent in spite of all intuition, 
all experience and insight, and which, as a further consequence, can 
result in being obstacles to the practical cultivation of science. We exclude 
these obstacles in the form of the natural “dogmatic” science (a term 
which here, and throughout this book, ought not to express any 
depreciation) by making clear to ourselves and vividly keeping in mind 
<48) only the most universal principle of all2b methods, the principle of the original 
right of all data, whereas we ignore the substantive and varied pro­
blems concerning the possibility of different cognitive modes and 
correlations.

§27. The World of the Natural Attitude: I and My Surrounding World.
We begin our considerations as human beings who are living natur­
ally, objectivating, judging, feeling, willing “in the natural attitude99 
W hat that signifies we shall make clear in simple meditations which 
can best be carried out in the first person singular.
I am conscious of a world endlessly spread out in space, endlessly 
becoming and having endlessly become in time. I am conscious of it: 
that signifies, above all, that intuitively I find it immediately,1 that I 
experience it.2 By my seeing, touching, hearing, and so forth, and in 
the different modes of sensuous perception, corporeal physical things 
with some spatial distribution or other are simply therefor me, “on hand99 
in the literal or the figurative sense, whether or not I am particularly 
heedful of them and busied with them in my considering, thinking, 
feeling, or willing. Animate beings too — human beings, let us say — 
are immediately there for me: I look up; I see them; I hear their 
approach; I grasp their hands; talking with them I understand 
immediately what they objectivate and think, what feelings stir 
within them, what they wish or will. They are also present as 
actualities in my field of intuition even when I do not heed them. But 
it is not necessary that they, and likewise that other objects, be found 
directly in my field of perception.3 Along with the ones now perceived, 
other actual objects are there for me as determinate, as more or less 
well known, without being themselves perceived or, indeed, present
(49) in any other mode of intuition. I can let my attention wander away

from the writing table which was just now seen and noticed, out 
through the unseen parts of the room which are behind my back, to 
the verandah, into the garden, to the children in the arbor, etc., to all 
the Objects I directly “know o f’ as being there and here in the 
surroundings of which there is also consciousness — a “knowing of 
them” which involves no conceptual thinking and4 which changes 
into a clear intuiting5 only with the advertence of attention, and even 
then only partially and for the most part very imperfectly.
But not even with the domain of this intuitionally clear or obscure, 
distinct or indistinct, co-present — which makes up a constant halo 
around the field of actual perception — is the world exhausted which 
is “on hand” for me in the manner peculiar to consciousness at every 
waking moment. On the contrary, in the fixed order of its being, it 
reaches into the unlimited. W hat is now perceived and what is more 
or less clearly co-present and determinate6 (or at least somewhat 
determinate), are penetrated and surrounded by an obscurely intended 
to horizon of indeterminate actuality. I can send rays of the illuminative 
regard of attention into this horizon with varying results. Determin­
ing presentations, obscure at first and then becoming alive, haul 
something out for me; a chain of such quasi-memories is linked 
together; the sphere of determinateness becomes wider and wider, 
perhaps so wide that connection is made with the field of actual 
perception as my central surroundings. But generally the result is 
different: an empty mist of obscure indeterminateness is populated 
with intuited possibilities or likelihoods; and only the “form” of the 
world, precisely as “ the world,” is predelineated. Moreover, my 
indeterminate surroundings are infinite, the7 misty and never fully 
determinable horizon is necessarily there.
W hat is the case with the world as existing in the order of the 
spatial present, which I have just been tracing, is also the case with 
respect to its order in the sequence of time. This world, on hand for me 
now and manifestly in every waking Now, has its two-sidedly infinite 
temporal horizon, its known and unknown, immediately living and 
lifeless past and future. In the free activity of experiencing which 
makes what is present intuited, I can trace these interrelations of the 
actuality immediately surrounding me.

I can change my standpoint in space and time, turn my regard in
(50) this or that direction, forwards or backwards in time; I can always 
obtain new perceptions and presentiations, more or less clear and 
more or less rich in content, or else more or less clear images in which 
I illustrate to myself intuitionally what is possible or likely within the 
fixed forms of a spatial and temporal world.
In my waking consciousness I find myself in this manner at all times, 
and without ever being able to alter the fact, in relation to the world 
which remains one and the same, though changing with respect to 
the composition of its contents. It is continually “on hand” for me 
and I myself am a member of it. Moreover, this world is there for me 
not only as a world of mere things, but also with the same immediacy 
as a world of objects with values, a world of goods, a practical world. I simply 
find the physical things in front of me furnished not only with merely 
material determinations but also with value-characteristics, as 
beautiful and ugly, pleasant and unpleasant, agreeable and disag­
reeable, and the like. Immediately, physical things stand there as 
Objects of use, the “table” with its “ books,” the “drinking glass,” the 
“vase” the “piano, ” etc. These value-characteristics and practical 
characteristics also belong constitutively to the Objects “on hand” as 
Objects, regardless of whether or not I turn to such characteristics 
and the Objects. Naturally this applies not only in the case of the 
“mere physical things,” but also in the case of humans and brute 
animals belonging to my surroundings.8 They are my “friends” or 
“enemies,” my “servants” or “superiors,” “strangers” or “re­
latives,” etc.
§28. The Cogito. My Natural Surrounding World and the Ideal Surrounding 
Worlds.
The complexes of my manifoldly changing spontaneities of conscious­
ness then relate to this world, the world in which I find myself and which is, 
at the same time, my surrounding world — complexes of investigative 
inspecting, of explicating and conceptualizing in descriptions, of 
comparing and distinguishing, of collecting and counting, of presup­
posing and inferring: in short, of theorizing consciousness in its
8Insertion in Copy A: with respcct to their social character Marginal note in Copy D: I and other 
human beings are, accordingly, present as worldlinesses

different forms and at its different levels. Likewise the multiform acts 
and states of emotion and of willing: liking and disliking, being glad 
and being sorry, desiring and shunning, hoping and fearing, decid­
ing and acting. All of them9 — including the simple Ego-acts in 
which I, in spontaneous advertence and seizing, am conscious of the 
world as immediately present — are embraced by the one Carte­
sian expression, cogito. Living along naturally, I live continually in 
<51) this fundamental form of “active” / aktuellen” / living whether, while so 
living, I state the cogito, whether I am directed “reflectively” to the Ego 
and the cogitare. If I am directed to them, a new cogito is alive, one 
that, for its part, is not reflected on and thus is not objective for me.10
I always find myself as someone who is perceiving, objectivating in 
memory or in phantasy, thinking, feeling, desiring etc.; and I find 
myself actively related in these activities for the most part to the 
actuality continually surrounding me. For I am not always so re­
lated; not every cogito in which I live has as its cogitatum physical 
things, human beings, objects or affair-complexes of some kind or 
other that belong to my surrounding world. I busy myself, let us say, 
with pure numbers and their laws: Nothing like that is present in the 
surrounding world, this world of “ real actuality.” The world of 
numbers is likewise there for me precisely as the Object-field of 
arithmetical busiedness; during such busiedness single numbers of 
numerical formations will be at the focus of my regard, surrounded 
by a partly determinate, partly indeterminate arithmetical horizon; 
but obviously this factual being-there-for-me, like the factually exist­
ent itself, is of a different sort. The arithmetical world is therefor me only if\ 
and as long as, I am in the arithmetical attitude.u The natural world, 
however, the world in the usual sense of the word is, and has been, 
therefor me continuously as long as I go on living naturally. As long as 
this is the case, I am “ in the natural attitude ” indeed both signify 
precisely the same thing. That need not be altered in any respect
9Marginal note in Copy A: Social acts should be mentioned too
10Marginal note in Copy A opposite the last two sentences: Natural attitude is related here to the real 
world at hand; the world is a universe of “what exists in itself.” But being broadened it must 
become related to everything “ideal” “existing in itself’ over against “us” which, to be sure, is 
there for us as coming from spontaneities, as a product, but then it too is nevertheless there 
“mentally.”
II Marginal note in Copy D: I am not always having experience and co-experience of it, as 1 am 
of the real world. Substitution in Copy A: The arithmetical world is there for me only if, and after, I 
have studied arithmetic 
only if, and after, I have systematically formed arithmetical ideas, 
seen them, and consequently appropriated them to myself along with an all-embracing 
horizon.

whatever if, at the same time, I appropriate to myself the arithm et­
ical world and other similar “worlds” by effecting the suitable 
attitudes.12 In that case the natural world remains “on hand:” after­
wards, as well as before, I am in the natural attitude, undisturbed in it 
by the new attitudes.13 If my cogito is moving only in the worlds pertain­
ing to these new attitudes, the natural world remains outside con­
sideration; it is a backgrond for my act-consciousness, but it is not a 
horizon within which an arithmetical world finds a place. The two worlds 
simultaneously present are not connected,14 disregarding their Ego- 
relation by virtue of which I can freely direct my regard and my acts 
into the one or the other.15
§29. The “Other” Ego-subjects and the Intersubjective Natural Surrounding 
World.
All that which holds for me myself holds, as I know, for all other 
human beings whom I find present in my surrounding world. <52> 
Experiencing them as human beings, I understand and accept each 
of them as an Ego-subject just as I myself am one, and as related to his 
natural surrounging world. But I do this in such a way that I take 
their surrounding world and mine Objectively as one and the same 
world of which we all are conscious, only in different modes. Each has 
his place from which he sees the physical things present; and, accord-

above, I once acquired the arithmetical world for myself, and therefore it has for me a time-

themselves, are not in space nor in space-time; they themselves have no place in a spatiotem-

here and there nor really connected with the real in which they may be “inherent.” Their

ingly, each has different physical-thing appearances. Also, for each 
the fields of actual perception, actual memory, etc., are different, 
leaving aside the fact that intersubjectively common objects of 
conciousness in those fields are intended to as having different modes, 
different manners of apprehension, different degrees of clarity, and 
so forth. For all that, we come to an understanding with our fellow 
human being and in common with them posit an Objective spa- 
tiotemporal actuality as our factually existent surrounding world16 to which 
we ourselves nonetheless belong.
§30. The General Positing which Characterizes the Natural Attitude.
W hat we presented as a characterization of the givenness belonging to 
the natural attitude, and therefore as a characterization of that 
attitude itself, was a piece of pure description prior to any “theory.” In 
these investigations, we keep theories — here the word designates 
preconceived17 opinions of every sort — strictly at a distance. Only as 
facts of our surrounding world, not as actual or supposed unities of 
validity, do theories belong in our sphere. But we do not set for 
ourselves now the task of continuing the pure description and raising 
it to the status of a systematically comprehensive characterization, 
exhausting the breadths and depths of what can be found as data 
accepted in the natural attitude (to say nothing of the attitudes 
which can be harmoniously combined with it). Such a task can and 
must be fixed — as a scientific task; and it is an extraordinarily 
important one, even though barely seen up to now.18 It is not our task 
here. For us, who are striving toward the entrance-gate of phenome­
nology, everything needed along that line has already been done; we 
need only a few quite universal characteristics of the natural attitude 
which have already come to the fore with a sufficiently full clarity in 
our descriptions. Just this full clarity was of particular consequence to 
us.
Once more, in the following propositions we single out something 
most important: As what confronts me, I continually find the one

rounding world,” each of us has his surrounding world accepted by him, the same communal

spatiotemporal actuality to which I belong like all other human 
beings who are to be found in it and who are related to it as I am. I19 
<53) find the “actuality” , the word already says it, as a factually existent 
actuality and also accept it as it presents itself to me as factually existing. No 
doubt about or rejection of data belonging to the natural world alters 
in any respect the general positing which characterizes the natural attitude. 
“The” world is always there as an actuality; here and there it is at 
most “otherwise” than I supposed; this or that is, so to speak, to be 
struck out of it and given such titles as “illusion” and “ hallucination,” 
and the like; <it is to be struck out of “ the” world> which — according 
to the general positing — is always factually existent. To cognize 
“the” world more comprehensively, more reliably, more perfectly in 
every respect than naive20 experiential cognizance can, to solve all 
the problems of scientific cognition which offer themselves within the 
realm of the world, that is the aim of the sciences belonging to the natural 
attitude.21
§31. 
Radical 
Alteration 
of the Natural 
Positing. 
“Excluding,” 
“Parenthesizing. ’ ’
Instead of remaining in this attitude, we propose to alter it radically. W hat we 
now must do is to convince ourselves of the essential possibility of the 
alteration in question.
The general positing, by virtue of which there is not just any 
continual apprehensional consciousness of the real surrounding 
world, but a consciousness of it as a factually existing “actuality,” 
naturally does not consist of a particular act, perchance an 
articulated22judgm ent about existence. It is, after all, something that 
lasts continuously throughout the whole duration of the attitude, i.e., 
throughout natural waking life. That which at any time is perceived, 
is clearly or obscurely presentiated — in short, everything which is, 
before any thinking, an object of experiential consciousness issuing, 
from the natural world — bears, in its total unity and with respect to 
all articulated saliencies in it, the characteristic “there,” “on hand;”
19In Copy A changed to read: In a never deviating concatenated experience I, as a waking Ego,
i0In Copy A naive is substituted by mere

natural positivity.
22Insertion in Copy A: predicative

and it is essentially possible to base on this characteristic an explicit 
(predicative) judgm ent of existence agreeing with it. If we state such 
a judgment, we nevertheless know that in it we have only made 
thematic and conceived as a predicate what already was somehow 
inherent, as unthematic, unthought, unpredicated, in the original 
experiencing or, correlatively, in the experienced, as the character­
istic of something “on hand.”
We can now proceed with the potential and inexplicit positing 
precisely as we can with the explicit judgment-positing. One pro­
cedure, possible at any time, is the attempt to doubt universally which 
Descartes carried out for an entirely different purpose with a view 
toward bringing out a sphere of absolutely indubitable being. We 
<54) start from here, but at the same time emphasize that the attempt to 
doubt universally shall serve us only as a methodic expedient for picking 
out certain points which, as included in its essence, can be brought to 
light and made evident by means of it.
The attem pt to doubt universally belongs to the realm of our perfect 
jreedom: we can attempt to doubt anything whatever, no matter how 
firmly convinced of it, even assured of it in an adequate evidence, we 
may be.
Let us reflect on what lies in the essence of such an act. Someone who 
attempts to doubt some “ being” or other, or predicatively expli­
cated, a “that exists,” a “that is how it is,” or the like. The sort of 
being does not matter. For example, someone who doubts whether 
an object, the being of which he does not doubt, is qualified thus and 
so, doubts precisely the being-qualified-thus-and-so. Obviously this is 
carried over from doubting to attempting to doubt. Furthermore, it is 
clear that we cannot doubt a being and, in the same consciousness 
(with the form of unity belonging to the simultaneous) posit the 
substrate of this being, thus being conscious of the substrate as having 
the characteristic, “on hand.” Equivalently expressed: The same 
material of being cannot be simultaneously doubted and held to be 
certain. In like manner, it is clear that the attempt to doubt anything 
intended to as something on hand necessarily effects a certain annulment of 
positing and precisely this interests us. The annulment in question is 
not a transmutation of positing into counter positing, of position into 
negation; it is also not a transmutation into uncertain presumption, 
deeming possible, undecidedness, into a doubt (in any sense what­
ever of the word): nor indeed is anything like that within the sphere of 
our free choice. Rather it is something wholly peculiar. We do not give up the

positing we effected, we do not in any respect alter our conviction which 
remains in itself as it is as long as we do not introduce newjudgment- 
motives: precisely this is what we do not do. Nevertheless the positing 
undergoes a modification: while it in itself remains what it is, 
we, so to speak, “put it out of action’” we “exclude it,” we “parenthesize it”. It 
is still there, like the parenthesized in the parentheses, like the 
excluded outside the context of inclusion [wie das Ausgeschaltete 
auferhalb des %\usammmhanges der Schaltung]. We can also say: The 
positing is a mental process, but we make “no use” of it, and this is not 
understood, naturally, as implying that we are deprived of it (as it 
would if we said of someone who was not conscious, that he made no <55) 
use of a positing); rather, in the case of this expression and all 
parallel expressions it is a matter of indicative designations of a 
definite, specifically peculiar mode of consciousness which is added to the 
original positing simpliciter23 (whether this is or not an actional 
[aktuelle] and even a predicative positing of existence) and, likewise in 
a specifically peculiar manner, changes its value. This changing of value 
is a matter in which we are perfectly free, and it stands over against all cogitative 
position-takings coordinate with the positing and incompatible with the 
positing in the unity of the'“simultaneous,” as well as over against 
all position-takings in the proper sense of the term.
In the attem pt to doubt which accompanies a positing which, as 
we presuppose, is certain and continued, the “excluding” is brought 
about in and with a modification of the counter positing, namely the 
“supposition” of non-being which is, therefore, part of the substratum of 
the attempt to doubt. In Descartes this part is so predominant that 
one can say that his attem pt to doubt universally is properly an 
attempt to negate universally. Here we disregard this part; we are 
not interested in every analytically distinguishable component of the 
attempt to doubt, and consequently we are not interested in the exact 
and fully sufficient analysis of it. We single out only the phenomenon of 
“parenthesizing” or “excluding” which, while obviously not restricted to 
the phenomenon of attempting to doubt, is particularly easy to 
analyze out and which can, on the contrary, make its appearance also 
in other combinations and, equally well, alone. With regard to any 
positing we can quite freely exercise this peculiar £tcoxt|, a certain 
ref raining from judgment™ which is compatible with the unshaken conviction of
23Marginal note to this clause in Copy A: which relates to the original positing
24Marginal note in Copy D: better, refraining from belief

truthy even with the unshakable conviction of evident truth. The positing is 
“put out of action,” parenthesized, converted into the modification, 
“parenthesized positing;” the judgment simpliciter is converted into 
the “parenthesized judgment”
Naturally one must not identify this consciousness with the consci­
ousness called “mere phantasying,” let us say, that nymphs are 
performing a round dance. In the latter consciousness, after all, no 
excluding of a living conviction, which remains alive,25 takes place. 
The consciousness of which we are speaking is even further from 
being a m atter ofjust thinking of something in the sense of “assuming” 
or presupposing, which, in ordinary equivocal language, can also be 
expressed by “ It seems to me (I make the assumption) that such and 
<56) such is the case.”
It should also be said that nothing prevents speaking correlatively of 
parenthesizing with respect to a positable26 objectivity belonging to no 
m atter what region and category. When speaking thus, we mean that 
every positing21 related to this objectivity is to be excluded and converted into 
its parenthetical modification. Furthermore, when the metaphor of 
parenthesizing is closely examined it is seen to be, from the very 
beginning, more suitable to the object-sphere; just as the locution of 
“putting out of action” is better suited to the act- or consciousness- 
sphere.
§32. The Phenomenological2* bnoxi\.
We could now let the universal £ko%t\, in our sharply determinate 
and novel sense of the term, take the place of the Cartesian attem pt to 
doubt universally. But with good reason we limit the universality of 
that. Since we are completely free to modify every positing and every 
judging [Urteil] and to parenthesize every objectivity which can be 
judged about if it were as comprehensive as possible, then no pro­
vince would be left for unmodified judgments, to say nothing of a 
province for science. But our purpose is to discover a new scientific 
domain, one that is to be gained by the method of parenthesizing which, 
therefore, must be a definitely restricted one.

26In Copies A and D positable is changed to somehow posited 
27In Copy A positing is changed to positing of being 
28Itt.se>tion in Copy I): transcendental

The restriction can be designated in a word.
We put out of action the general positing which belongs to the essence of the 
natural attitude; we parenthesize everything which that positing en­
compasses with respect to being:29 thus the whole natural world which is 
continually “ there for us” , “on hand,” and which will always remain 
there according to consciousness as an “actuality” even if we choose 
to parenthesize it.
If I do that, as I can with complete freedom, then I am not negating 
this “world” as though I were a sophist; I am not doubting its factual 
being as though I were a skeptic; rather I am exercising the “ pheno­
menological” foioxfl30 which also completely shuts me offfrom any judgment 
about spatiotemp oral factual being.
Thus I exclude all sciences relating to this natural world no matter how 
firmly they stand there for me, no m atter how much I admire them, 
no m atter how little I think of making even the least objection to 
<57) them; I make absolutely no use of the things posited in them [von ihren 
Geltungen]. Nor do I make my own a single one of the propositions belonging to 
<those sciences>, even though it be perfectly evident; none is accepted by me; none 
gives me afoundation — let this be well noted: as long as it is understood

to the positive sciences, a universal realm of being for a cognition which progresses in 
experience and thinking. From now on I effect no experience of the real in a naively 
straightforward way. I do not receive what an experience of the real offers me as simply 
existing, as presumably or probably existing, as doubtful, as null (as illusion). The modes of 
acceptance operative in naive experiencing, the naive effecting of which is one’s “standing on 
the basis of experience” (without having put oneself on that basis by a particular purposing 
and decision), I put out of operation, I deny myself that basis. This concerns experiences of 
something worldly, not merely singly, one by one. Any single experience of something has, 
according to its essence, “its” universal experiential horizon which, although inexplicitly, 
carries with itself the openly endless totality of the existing world as continiously co-accepted.
I inhibit precisely the being-accepted-beforehand of “this” world or its antecedent being-for- 
me which, as a being posited both actually and habitually, carries me continuously in my 
entire natural living and is thus the foundation of all my practical and theoretical living; I 
take from it the force that, up to now, gave me the world of experience as my basis. And yet 
the old course of my experience goes on as it always has, except that this experience, modified 
by the new attitude, no longer supplies the “basis” on which I was standing up to now. In this 
manner I exercise the phenomenological epoche, which also shuts me off, eo ipso, from 
effecting any judgment, from taking any position predicatively toward being and being-thus 
and all the modalities of being which pertain to the spatiotemporal factual being of anything 
“real.”

as it is presented in one of those sciences as a truth about actualities of 
this world. I must not accept such a proposition until after I have put 
parenthesis around it.31 That signifies that I may accept such a pro­
position only in the modified consciousness, the consciousness of 
judgment-excluding,32 and therefore not as it is in science, a proposition 
which claims validity and the validity of which I accept and use.
The £710X^1 in question here is not to be mistaken for the one 
which33 positivism requires, but which indeed, as we had to persuade 
ourselves, is itself violated by such positivism. It is not now a matter of 
excluding all prejudices that cloud the pure objectivity of research, 
not a m atter of constituting a science “free of theories,” “free of 
metaphysics,” by groundings all of which go back to the immediate 
findings,34 nor a m atter of means for attaining such ends, about the 
value of which there is, indeed, no question. W hat we demand lies in 
another direction. The whole prediscovered world posited in the 
natural attitude, actually found in experience and taken with perfect 
“freedom from theories” as it is actually experienced, as it clearly 
shows itself in the concatenations of experience,35 is now without 
validity for us;36 without being tested and also without being con­
tested, it shall be parenthesized. In like manner all theories and 
sciences which relate to this world, no m atter how well they may be 
grounded positivistically or otherwise, shall meet the same fate.

§33. Preliminary Indication of “Pure” or “ Transcendental” Consciousness As 
the Phenomenological Residuum.
We have learned to understand the sense of the phenomenological 
£710x^1 but not by any means its possible effect. Above all, it is not 
clear to what extent the previous delimitation of the total sphere of 
the friox*! actually involves a restriction of its universality.1 What can 
remain, if the whole world} including ourselves with all our cogitare, is 
excluded?2,3
<58) 
Since the reader already knows that the interest governing these 
meditations concerns a new eidetics, he will at first expect that, more 
particularly, the world as m atter of fact is excluded but not the world 
as Eidos, not any other sphere of essences. Indeed, the exclusion of the 
world actually does not signify the exclusion of the world of, e.g., the 
number series or arithmetic as relating to it.
Nevertheless we shall not take this path; it does not lead toward 
our goal which we can also characterize as the acquisition of a new region 
of being never before delimited14 in its own peculiarity — a region which, like
1Substitution in Copy D for this sentence: First of all, it is not clear to what extent the previously 
given outline of the scope of the epoche may involve a restriction to something less than the 
universal sphere of experienceable being and possible judgments.
2Addition in Copy D: After the exclusion of the universal basis provided in experience, 
experience in the usual sense, can any possible experience and experiential basis whatever 
remain by which the field of being for a science might be given?
3Substitution in Copy A for this sentence: What can remain if the whole world, including us 
human beings, is excluded? Marginal note: Is the wordly All not the All of whatever exists? Is 
there any sense to ask for that which “remains”? As a matter of fact, the expression is 
objectionable because, having been taken from the world of sensuous reality, it carries with it 
the thought of doing away with one part of a whole, one part of a real context. The question 
may, however, still have a legitimate sense when stated in the form: What can still be posited as 
being if the worldly All, the All of reality, remains parenthesized?
xIn Copy A the word delimited changed to exhibited

any other genuine region, is a region of individual being.5 W hat that 
means we shall learn, more particularly, from the findings that 
follow.
We shall proceed, first of all, with a direct demonstrable showing 
and, since the being that we want to demonstrably show is nothing 
else than what we shall designate, for essential reasons,6 as “pure 
mental processes,” “pure consciousness” with its pure “correlates of 
consciousness” and, on the other hand, its “pure Ego” <we shall> start 
with the Ego, the consciousness, and the mental processes which are 
given to us in the natural attitude.7.
I,8 the actual human being, am a real Object like others in the 
natural world. I effect cogitationes, acts of consciousness in both the 
broader and narrower sense and these acts, as belonging to this 
human subject, are occurrences within the same natural actuality. 
And likewise all my other9 mental processes, out of the changing 
stream of which the specific Ego-acts flash in so specifically peculiar a 
manner, pass over into one another, become connected in syntheses, 
become incessantly modified. In a broadest sense, the expression con­
sciousness comprehends (but then indeed less suitably) all mental pro­
cesses.10 “In the natural attitude,” as we are even in our scientific 
thinking, by virtue of extremely firm habits which have never been 
contravened, we take all these findings of psychological reflection12 
as real worldly occurences, just as mental processes in the lives of 
animate beings. So natural is it for us to see them only as such that 
now, when already acquainted with the possibility of an altered 
attitude and searching for the new Object-province, we do not even 
note that it is from these very spheres of mental processes that the new
*Note in Copy A: Individual being is given as actual by experience. Correlatively, then, we are 
saying also that it is a question of discovering an experience which, as contrasted with Objective
— or, to characterize it more distinctly, worldly — experience, is of a completely new kind, an 
all-embracing, endless experience, in (lie harmonious course of which this new sphere of being 
becomes constituted.

province arises by virtue of the new attitude.13 As a consequence, it 
follows that instead of keeping our regard turned toward those14 
spheres, we turned it away from them and sought the new Objects in 
the ontological realms of arithmetic, geometry, and the like — 
where, after all, nothing genuinely new could be attained.
We shall therefore keep our regard fixed upon the sphere of <59) 
consciousness15 and study what we find immanently within it. First of 
all, without as yet effecting the phenomenological judgment- 
exclusions, we shall subject it to a systematic, though by no means 
exhaustive, eidetic analysis. W hat we absolutely need is a certain 
unversal insight into16 the essence of any consciousness whatever and also, 
quite particularly, of consciousness in so far as it is, in itself, by its 
essence consciousness of “natural” actuality. In these studies we shall 
go as far as is necessary to effect the insight at which we are aiming, 
namely the insight17 that consciousness has, in itself\ a being of its own which 
in its own absolute essence, is not touched by the phenomenological exclusion. It 
therefore remains as the “phenomenological residuum ” as a region of 
being which is of essential necessity quite unique and which can

17 The following text from Copy D m il serve to illustrate one of several attempts made by Husserl to rewrite 
the text at this point. It is published as Appendix 37 by Schuhmann (Fall, 1929): <the insight that> 
consciousness can be seized upon in a consequential internal experience as essentially coherent 
in itself, an openly endless and yet self-contained sphere of being with its own forms, those of an 
“immanental” temporality. And it will be our task to show that just this sphere of being is not 
touched by the phenomenological exclusion described above.
To state the matter more precisely: By virtue of the phenomenological putting out of action 
our existential acceptance of the Objective world as existing, this sphere of “immanental” 
being does indeed lose the sense of being a real stratum in the reality belonging to the world and 
human being (or beast), which is a reality already presupposing the world. It loses the sense of 
being human conscious life, as can be seized upon progressively by anyone in purely “internal” 
experience. But it is not simply lost; rather, when we maintain that attitude of epoche, it 
receives the sense of an absolute sphere of being, an absolutely self-sufficient sphere which is, in 
itself, what it is —  apart from any question concerning the being or non-being of the world and 
its human beings, while we refrain from taking any position regarding that matter, thus 
receiving the sense of something already existing beforehand in itself and for itself, no matter 
how the question of the being of the world — which can be righdy asked and answered only in 
this sphere — may be answered on the basis of good or bad reasons. Therefore the sphere of 
pure consciousness with whatever is inseparable from it (including the “pure Ego”) remains as 
the “phenomenological residuum,” as a region of being which is essentially quite unique, a 
region which can become the field of a science of consciousness with a correspondingly novel 
an essentially novel — sense: phenomenology.

indeed become the field of a science of a novel kind: phenomenology.
The “phenomenological” foioxfj W*U deserve its name only by 
means of this insight; the fully conscious effecting of that £rcoxf| will 
prove itself to be the operation necessary to make “pure” consciousness, 
and subsequently the whole phenomenological region, accessible to us. Precisely 
that makes it comprehensible why this region and the18 novel science 
correlated with it remained necessarily unknown: In the natural 
attitude nothing else but the natural world is seen. As long as the 
possibility of the phenomenological attitude had not been recog­
nized, and the method for bringing about an originary seizing upon 
the objectivities that arise with that attitude had not been developed, 
the phenomenological world19 had to remain unknown, indeed, 
hardly even suspected.20
Concerning our terminology we may add the following. Im port­
ant motives, grounded in the21 epistemological problematic, justify 
our designating “pure” consciousness, about which we shall have so 
much to say, as transcendental consciousness and the operation by which 
it is reached the transcendental friox*!. As a method this operation22will 
be divided into different steps of “excluding,” “parenthesizing;” and 
thus our method will assume the characteristic of a step-by-step 
reduction. For this reason we shall, on most occasions, speak of 
<60) phenomenological reductions (but also, with reference to their collective 
unity, we shall speak of the phenomenological reduction) and, ac­
cordingly, from an epistemological point of view, we shall refer to 
transcendental reductions. It should be added that these terms and all 
our others must be understood exclusively in the senses that our 
expositions prescribe for them and not in any others which history or 
the terminological habits of the reader may suggest.23

The word, “phenomenology,” and its derivatives have many significations. What is aimed at 
here, as is apparent from the indications given up to now, is a phenomenology of an entirely 
peculiar sort, the definite designation of which is transcendental phenomenology. I wish to 
emphasize especially and with direct reference to these terms (in particular the term “tran­
scendental”) that they (like all the terms to be introduced later) [original text follows. The 
Appendix was written Fall, 1929.]

§34. The Essence of Consciousness as Theme.2*
We begin25 with a series of observations which we shall make without 
troubling ourselves with any phenomenological26 £rcoxfl. We are 
directed to the “external world”27 in a natural manner and, without 
relinquishing the natural attitude, we effect a psychological28 re­
flection on our Ego and its mental living. Quite as we should if we had 
heard nothing of the new29 sort of attitude, we engross ourselves in 
the essence of the30 “consciousness of something” in which, for example, we 
are conscious of the factual existence of material things, animate 
organisms, human beings, the factual existence of31 technical and 
literary works, and so forth.32 We follow33 our universal principle 
that every individual event has its essence, which can be seized upon 
in eidetic purity and, in this purity, must belong to a field of possible 
eidetic research. Accordingly, the general natural fact, “ I am ,” “ I 
think,” “ I have a world over against me,”34 and the like, has its 
essential content with which we shall now busy ourselves exclusively. 
We therefore effect, as examples, any single mental processes what­
ever of consciousness and take them as they themselves are given to us 
in the natural attitude, as real hum an facts; or else we presentiate 
such mental processes to ourselves in memory or in freely inventive 
phantasy. On the basis of such examples which, let us presuppose, are 
perfectly clear,35 we seize upon and fix,36 in an adequate ideation,37

the pure essences that interest us. In the process, the single facts, the 
facticity of the natural world taken universally, disappear from our 
theoretical regard — as they do wherever we carry out a purely 
eidetic research.
Let us limit our theme still more narrowly. Its title runs: conscious­
ness or, more distinctly, any mental processes whatever of consciousness in 
an extraordinarily broad sense,38 the exact limitation of which for­
tunately does not matter. Such a limitation does not lie at the 
beginning of analyses of the sort which we are carrying on here, but is 
a late result of great labors. As the starting point, we take conscious- 
<61) ness in a pregnant sense and one which offers itself first, which we can 
designate most simply by the Cartesian term cogito, by the phrase “ I 
think.” As is well known, cogito was understood so broadly by 
Descartes that it comprised every “ I perceive, I remember, I 
phantasy, I judge, I feel, I desire, I will,” and thus all egoical mental 
processes which are at all similar to them, with their countless 
flowing particular formations. The Ego itself, to which they are all 
related or which, in very different manners, lives “in” them actively, 
passively or spontaneously, which “comports” itself receptively and 
otherwise in them, shall be at first left39 out of consideration; more 
particularly, the Ego in every sense40 shall be left out of considerat­
ion. Later on41 the Ego shall be dealt with thoroughly.42 For now, 
enough is left that gives support to43 analysis and the apprehension of 
essences. In that connection, we shall find ourselves immediately 
referred to those comprehensive concatenations of mental processes 
that compel a broadening of the concept, mental process of consci­
ousness, beyond this sphere made up of cogitationes in the specific 
<Cartesian> sense.
We consider44 mental processes of consciousness in the entire fullness 
of the concreteness within which they present themselves45 in their 
concrete context — the stream of mental processes — and which, by

virtue of their own essence, they46 combine to make up. It then 
becomes evident that every mental process belonging to the stream47 
which can be reached by our reflective regard has an essence of its own 
which can be seized upon intuitively,48 a “content” which allows of 
being considered by itself in its ownness *9 O ur concern is to seize upon 
and to universally characterize this50 own content of the cogitation in 
its pure ownness51 by excluding everything which does not lie in the 
cogitatio with respect to what the cogitatio is in itself. It is equally our 
concern to characterize the unity of consciousness required, and there­
fore necessarily required, purely by what belongs to the cogitationes as their 
own such that they could not exist52 without that unity.
§35. The Cogito as “Act.” 53 Non-actionality Modification.
Let us begin with examples. Lying in front of me in the semi-darkness 
is this sheet of paper. I am seeing it, touching it. This perceptual 
seeing and touching of the sheet of paper, as the full concrete mental 
awareness of the sheet of paper lying here and given precisely with 
respect to these qualities, appearing to me precisely with this relative 
obscurity, with this imperfect determinateness in this orientation, is a 
cogitatio, a mental process of consciousness. The sheet of paper itself, 
with its Objective determinations, its extension, its Objective posit­
ion relative to the spatial thing called my organism,54 is not a <62) 
cogitatio but a cogitatum; it is not a mental process of perception 
but something perceived.55 Now something perceived can very well

52Addition in Copy D: and thereby acquiring the insight that an experience of pure conscious­
ness can be of such a sort that, progressing from one pure mental process to another, it never 
touches on, nor takes in, anything other than more consciousness — to which all syntheses of 
consciousness belong. Thus, in other words, a universal field of pure consciousness, first of all, 
my pure consciousness in the psychological sense, shall be exhibited as a self-contained infinite 
field of possible experience and experiential showing: as such, a field for an effectable reduction 
to purity [ein Feld zu vollziehender reiner Reduktion].

y,Ma)guial note m Copy A: That is obscure. The sheet of paper itself, the sheet of paper existing,

be itself a mental process of consciousness; but it is evident that such 
an affair as a material physical thing, for example, this sheet of paper 
given in the mental process of perception, is by essential necessity not a 
mental process but a being56 of a wholly different mode of being.57
Before we investigate that further, let us multiply the examples. In 
perceiving proper, as an attentive perceiving, I am turned toward 
the object, for instance, the sheet of paper; I seize upon it as this 
existent here and now. The seizing-upon is a singling out and seizing; 
anything perceived has an experiential background. Around the 
sheet of paper lie books, pencils, an inkstand, etc., also “perceived” in 
a certain manner, perceptually there, in the “field of intuition;” but, 
during the advertence to the sheet of paper, they were without even a 
secondary advertence and seizing-upon. They were appearing and 
yet were not seized upon and picked out, not posited singly for 
themselves. Every perception of a physical thing has, in this manner, 
a halo of background-intuitions (or background-seeings, in case one 
already includes in intuiting the advertedness to the really seen), and 
that is also a “mental process of consciousness” or, more briefly, “consci­
ousness,” and, more particularly, “o/” all that which in fact lies in the 
objective “ background” seen along with it. Obviously in saying this 
we are not speaking of that which58 is to be found “Objectively”59 in 
the60 Objective space which may belong to the seen background; we 
are not speaking of all the physical things and physical61 occurrences 
which valid and progressing experience62 may ascertain there. We 
speak exclusively of the halo of consciousness which belongs to the63 
essence of a perception effected in the mode of “advertence to the
or perhaps not existing, in Objective truth, as what it is in truth with its determinations which 
perchance belong to it in Objective truth, is not the mental process even though it belongs 
inseparably to the mental process, that “this sheet of paper” belongs to it <as> “being <in> the 
spatial world.” The mental process is a perceiv <ing>. [The glosses are by Schuhmann.]
56 In Copy A being is changed to existent

contained therein as a real component part. Consequently, with all that is proper to it, it 
undergoes the phenomenological epoche. Addition in Copy A: And yet it is clear that the cogitatio 
is, in itself, cogitatio of its cogitatum, and that its cogitatum, as cogitatum, and in the manner in 
which it is there, is inseparable from the cogitatio.

Object”64 and, furthermore, of what is inherent in the essence proper 
of this halo. In it, however, there is the fact that certain modifications 
of the original mental process are possible65 which we characterize as a 
free turning of “regard” — not precisely nor merely ofthe physical, but 
rather of the “mental regard’ \“geistigen Blickes”] — from the sheet of 
paper regarded at first, to the objects appearing, therefore intended to 
“implicitly” before the turning of the regard but which become 
explicitly intended to (either “attentively” perceived or “incidentally 
heeded” ) after the regard is turned to them.
Physical things are intended to not only in perception but also66 in 
memories and in presentiations similar to memories as well as in free 
phantasies.67 All this, sometimes in “clear intuition,” sometimes 
without noticeable intuitedness in the manner of “obscure”68 ob­
jectivations; in such cases they hover before us with different “char­
acteristics”69 as actual physical things, possible physical things, 
phantasied physical things, etc.. O f these essentially different mental 
processes obviously everything is true that we adduced about mental <63) 
processes of perception. We shall not think of confusing the objects 
intended to in these modes of consciousness70 (for example, the 
phantasied water nymphs) with the mental processes themselves of 
consciousness which are consciousness of those objects.71 We re­
cognize then that, to the essence of all such mental processes — these 
always taken in full concreteness — there belongs that noteworthy 
modification which converts consciousness in the mode of actional 
[aktueller] advertence into consciousness in the male of non-actionality 
[Inaktualitat] and conversely. At the one time the mental process is, so 
to speak, “explicit” consciousness of its objective something, at the

other time it is implicit, merely potential. The objective something can 
be already appearing to us72as it does not only in perception, but also 
in memory or in phantasy; however, we are not yet “directed” to it with 
the mental regard, not even secondarily — to say nothing of our being, 
in a peculiar sense,73 “busied” with it.74
In the sense pertaining to the sphere of the Cartesian examples we 
note something similar in no matter what other cogitationes: with 
respect to all mental processes of thinking, feeling, or willing, except 
that, as the next section will show, the “directedness to,” the “adver- 
tedness to,” which distinguishes actionality [Aktualitat] does not (as 
in the preferred — because the simplest — examples of sensuous 
objectivations) coincide with that heeding of Objects of conscious­
ness which seizes upon and picks them out. It is likewise obviously true of 
all such mental processes that the actional ones are surrounded by a 
“halo” of non-actional mental processes; the stream of mental processes 
can never consist of just actionalities.75 Precisely these, when contrasted 
with non-actionalities, determine with the widest universality, to be 
extended beyond the sphere of our examples, th t pregnant sense of the 
expression “cogito ” “ I have consciousness of something,” “ I effect an 
act of consciousness.” To keep this fixed concept76 sharply separated, 
we shall reserve for it exclusively the Cartesian terms, cogito and 
cogitationes — unless we indicate the modification explicitly by some 
such adjunct as “non-actional.” 77
We can define a “waking” Ego as one which, within its stream of 
mental processes, continuously effects consciousness in the specific 
form of the cogito;78 which naturally does not mean that it continu­
ally gives, or is able to give at all, predicative expression to these 
<64) mental processes. There are, after all, brute animal Ego-subjects. 
According to what is said above, however, it is of the essence of a

§36. Intentive Mental Processes. Mental Process Taken Universally.
However thorough the alteration which mental processes of actional 
consciousness undergo in consequence of their going over into non- 
actionality, the modified mental processes still continue to have a 
significant community of essence with the original ones. Universally 
it belongs to the essence of every actional cogito to be consciousness of 
something. In its own manner however, according to what was set 
forth previously, the modified cogitatio is also consciousnessy and79 consci­
ousness of the same thing as that intended to in> the corresponding 
unmodified consciousness. Accordingly the universal essential pro­
perty pertaining to consciousness is still preserved in the modifica­
tion. All mental processes having these essential properties in common 
are also called “intentive mental processes” (acts in the broadest sense of 
the Logische Untersuchungen); in so far as they are consciousness of 
something, they are said to be “ intentively referred19 to this something.
As a consequence, it should be well heeded that here we are not 
speaking of a relation between some80 psychological occurrence — called a 
mental process — and another real factual existence — called an 
object — nor of a psychological connection81 taking place in Objective 
actuality between the one and the other. Rather we are speaking of 
mental processes purely with respect to their essence, or of pure 
essences82 and of that which is “a priori” included in the essences with 
unconditional necessity.

facts, the pure essence which is seized upon in ideation as a pure

and anything to be found in the stream of mental processes; accord­
ingly91 not only the intentive processes, the actional and potential 
cogitationes taken in their full concreteness, but also whatever is to be 
found in the way of really inherent moments in this stream and its 
concrete parts.
One easily sees, that is, that not every really inherent moment in the 
concrete unity of an intentive mental process itself has thefundamental 
characteristic, intentionality, thus the property of being “consciousness of 
something.” That concerns, for example, all data of sensation which 
play so great a role in perceptual intuitions of physical 
things. Within the mental process of perceiving this sheet of white 
paper, more precisely, within those components of the perceiving 
which relate to the quality, whiteness, belonging to the sheet of 
paper, we find, by a suitable turning of regard,92 the Datum of 
sensation, white. This white93 is something which belongs insepar­
ably to the essence of the concrete perception, and belongs to it as a 
really inherent concrete component. As the content that is “pre­
sentive” with respect to the appearing white of the paper, it is the 
bearer of an intentionality; however, it is not itself a consciousness of 
something. The very same thing obtains in the case of other really 
inherent Data, for example, the so-called sensuousfeelings. Later on we 
shall discuss this in greater detail.
§37. The Pure Ego’s “Directedness-to” Within the Cogito and the Heeding 
Which Seizes Upon.
W ithout being able to go more deeply here into a descriptive94 eidetic 
analysis of intentive mental processes, we shall bring out some mo­
ments which should be heeded in the interest of further exposition. If 
an intentive mental process is actional, that is, effected in the manner 
of the cogito, then in that process the subject95 is “directing” himself 
to the intentional Object. To the cogito itself there belongs, as 
immanent in it, a “regard-to” the Object which, on the other side,

wells forth from the “Ego” which therefore can never be lacking. 
This Ego-regard to something varies with the act: in perception, it is 
a perceptual regard-to; in phantasying, an inventive regard-to; in 
liking, a liking regard-to; in willing, a willing regard-to; etc. This 
signifies that this having the mind’s eye on something, which pertains 
to the essence of the cogito, of the act as act,96 is not itself, in turn, an act 
in its own right and especially must not be confused with a perceiving 
<66) (no m atter how broad a sense) nor with any sorts of act akin to 
perceptions. It should be noted that97 intentional Object of a consci­
ousness (taken in the manner in which the intentional Object is the 
full correlate of a consciousness), by no means signifies the same as 
Object seized upon. We are accustomed simply to include being 
seized upon in our concept of the Object (any object whatever)98 
because, as soon as we think of the Object, as soon as we say 
something about it, we have made it the object in the sense of what is 
seized upon. The seizing-upon in the broadest sense is equivalent to 
noticing it, whether in being especially attentive or in heeding it 
incidentally: at least as these locutions are usually understood. Now 
this heeding or seizing-upon is not a matter of the mode of any cogito whatever, 
the mode of actionality; seen more precisely, it is instead a particular 
act-mode which can be taken on by any consciousness, or any act, 
which does not already have it. If that occurs, its intentional Object is 
not just any object whatever of consciousness and in view as some­
thing to which the mental regard is directed; it is rather an Object 
seized upon, heeded. To a physical thing, to be sure, we cannot be 
turned otherwise than in the manner of seizing upon; and so for all 
objectivities which can be “objectivated s im p ly advertence (even if it be in 
phantasying) is eo ipso “seizing upon,” “heeding.” However, in the 
act of valuing, we are turned to the valued; in the act of gladness, to 
the gladsome; in the act of loving, to the loved; in the acting to the 
action; but without seizing upon any of them. Rather the intentional 
Object, the valuable as valuable, the gladsome as gladsome, the 
loved as loved, the hoped as hoped, the action as action, becomes an 
object seized upon only in a particular “ objectifying” turn. Being 
turned valuingly to a thing involves, to be sure, a seizing upon the 
mere thing; not, however, the mere thing, but rather the valuable thing

or the value" is the full100 intentional correlate of the valuing act. (About 
this we shall still speak in more detail.) Accordingly, “being turned 
valuingly to a thing” does not signify already “having99 the value101 “as 
object99 in the particular sense of the seized-upon object such as we 
must have it in order to predicate about it; and it is the same in the 
case of all logical acts relating to it.
In acts of the sort to which valuing acts belong, we thus have “an 
intentional Object99 in a dual sense: We must distinguish between the mere 
“thing93 and thefull intentional Object; and, correspondingly, <there is> a 
dual intentio,102 a two-fold advertedness.103 If we are directed to a thing <67> 
in an act of valuing, then our direction to the thing itself is a 
heeding104 of it, a seizing upon it; but we are “directed” — only not in 
the manner of seizing upon — also to the value. Not only the ob- 
jectivating of the thing but also the valuing of the thing which 
includes105the objectivating, has the mode of actionality,106
But we must immediately add that the situation is as simple as this 
only in simple acts of valuing. Universally, emotional acts and acts of 
willing are founded on higher levels; and, accordingly, the inten­
tional Objectivity is multiplied as are the manners in which the 
Objects included in the unitary total Objectivity are, or can be, 
turned to. In any case however, what is said in the following para­
graph holds good:
In any act107 some mode of heedfulness dominates. But whenever the act is not 
simply consciousness of a thing, whenever there is founded on such a 
consciousness a further consciousness in which “a position is taken” 
with respect to the thing, then thing and full intentional Object (for 
example: “thing” and “value” ), likewise heeding and having the mind9s 
eye on, separately arise. But, at the same time, the essence of these 
founded acts involves the possibility of a modification by which their 
full intentional Objects become heeded and, in this sense, “ob-

confront, and therefore as members of the natural world, not <only> mere 
things of nature but also values and practical Objects of every sort: 
streets with street lights, dwellings, furniture, works of art, books, 
tools, and so forth.108
§38. Reflections on Acts. Perception of Something Immanent and of Something 
Transcendent.
We add the following:109 When living in the cogito we are not101 
conscious of the cogitatio itself as an intentional Object; but at any 
time it can become an Object of consciousness; its essence involves the 
essential possibility of a reflective turning of regard and naturally in the 
form of a new cogitatio that, in the manner proper to a cogitatio 
which simply seizes upon,111 is directed to it. In other words, any 
<cogatio> can become the object of a so-called “internal perception” 
and in further succession the Object of a reflective valuation, an 
approval or a disapproval, etc. The same holds in a correspondingly 
<68) modified way not only for actual112 acts in the sense of act-
106 Addition in Copy D (published by Schuhmann as Appendix 40, dated Fall, 1929): It is thus not only 
in the case of concrete real Objects, but also in the case of processes, relationships, com­
binations, wholes and parts, and the like. For example: we have not only natural processes but 
also actions, alterations in the works of the mind, in cultural Objects of every sort and as 
cultural Objects (e.g., loss of value in works of art because of “spoiling,” machines becoming 
useless), and complexes of literary works, not as mere physical things belonging to Nature but 
as chapters in a book or as the complex of works making up a national literature, relative to 
authors, readers, nations, etc. With respect to the manners of givenness, we then find not
merely plnsical “horizons” as horizons of a possible experience of Nature, but also value-
horizons and practical horizons; for example, the practical horizon which the doer has at all 
limes in his purposefully activc doing relative to the unity of a goal which itself stands in mere 
cxicnsivc <oncaicnations of ends. In addition, however, there are essentially possible dif­
ferences in attitude (always within the total frame of the natural attitude) such that all 
Objectivities, no matter how highly founded, for instance, those arising from the originally 
valuing attitude, or from the originally practical attitude, can be taken over into the “theoret­
ical” attitude of seizing-upon and can therefore become the themes of either a transitory or a 
consistently maintained “objectivating:” in particular, an experiencing, explicating, predicat­
ing, etc.

impressions, but also for acts of which we are conscious “in ” 
phantasy, “in” memory, or else “in” empathy when we are under­

memory,114 empathy, etc., and in the various possible modifications, 
make the acts of which there is consciousness “in” them Objects of 
seizing-upon and of position-taking acts based on seizings-upon.115
We start here with* the distinction between perceptions or acts of 
whatever sort of something transcendent and of something immanent. 
Because of serious objections to it, we shall avoid the locution, 
external 
and 
internal 
perception. 
We offer the following 
clarifications.
116By acts directed to something immanent, more generally formulated, 
by intentive mental processes related to something immanent, we understand 
those to which it is essential that their intentional objects, if they exist at all, 
belong to the same stream of mental processes to which they themselves belong. 
That is the case, for example, wherever an act related to an act 
(wherever a cogitatio relates to a cogitatio) of the same Ego, or where 
an act relates to a sensuous feeling-Datum belonging to the same 
Ego, etc. The consciousness and its Object form an individual unity 
made up purely of mental processes.
Intentive mental processes of which that is not the case are directed to 
something transcendent. Such, for example, are all acts directed to 
essences or to intentive mental processes belonging to other Egos with 
other streams of mental processes, and likewise all acts directed to 
physical things or to realities of whatever sort, as will be shown.
In the case of a perception117 directed to something immanent, or 
briefly expressed, a perception of something immanent (so-called “inter­
nal” perception), perception and perceived 118 form essentially an un­
mediated unity, that of a single concrete cogitatio. Here the perceiving 
includes its Object in itself in such a manner that it only can be

moment, from its Object. If that which is being perceived is an 
intentive mental process, as it is when we are reflecting on a convic­
tion which is alive just now (perhaps stating: I am convinced th a t...), 
we have an interpenetration of two intentive mental processes, at 
least the higher of which is non-selfsufficient and at the same time not 
<69) only founded on the lower but also intentively turned to it.
This sort of really inherent “includedness” (strictly speaking, a meta­
phor) is a pre-eminent characteristic of the perception of something immanent 
and of the position-taking founded on such perception; it is lacking in most 
other cases120 of relation to something immanent on the part of 
intentive mental processes.121 Thus, for example, it is lacking even in 
the case of rememberings of rememberings. The remembered re­
membering that occurred yesterday does not belong to the present 
remembering as a really inherent component of its concrete unity. 
With respect to its own full full essence, the present remembering could 
exist even though in truth the past remembering had never existed; 
whereas the past remembering, if it actually did exist, belongs 
necessarily with the present remembering, to the one identical and 
uninterrupted stream which continuously mediates the two by vari­
ous concretions of mental processes. In this respect, the situation is 
obviously quite different in the case of perceptions of something 
transcendent and other intentive mental processes relating to some­
thing transcendent. Not only does the perception of the physical 
thing not contain the physical thing itself as part ofits really inherent 
composition; the perception of the physical thing is also without any122 
essential unity with it, its existence, naturally, being presupposed here. 
The unity of the stream of mental processes is the only unity determined purely by 
the123 essences proper of the mental processes themselves; or, this being the 
same thing, a mental process can be combined only with mental 
processes to make up a whole the total essence of which embraces and 
is founded on the124 essences proper of these mental processes. In the 
sequel this proposition will become even clearer and acquire125 its 
proper, and great, significance.

§39. Consciousness and Natural Actuality. The “Naive” Human Being's 
Conception.
All of the essential characteristics of a126 mental process and of 
consciousness which we have discovered are for us so many necessary 
steps127 for reaching the goal continually guiding us, namely the 
acquisition of the essence128 of that129 “pure” consciousness which will 
determine the field of phenomenology. O ur observations have been 
eidetic; but the single particulars falling under the essences Mental 
Process, Stream of Mental Processes, and “Consciousness” in every 
sense, have130 belonged to the natural world as real occurrences. We 
have therefore, not abandoned the basis of the natural attitude. An 
individual consciousness is involved with the natural world in a dual 
manner: it is the consciousness belonging to some human being or beast; 
and, at least in a great number ofits particularities, it is consciousness <70) 
of that world.131 In view of this involvement with the real world, what is meant 
now by saying that a consciousness has an essence “of its own” and that, with 
another consciousness, it makes up a self-contained concatenation deter­
mined purely by the essences proper, a concatenation of the stream of 
consciousness? Since we can understand consciousness here in any, 
even the broadest, sense, which ultimately coincides with the concept 
of mental process, the question concerns the essence proper of the 
stream of mental processes and all its components. To what extent, in 
the first place, is the material world something of an essentially differ­
ent kind excluded from the132 essentiality proper of mental processes? And 
if that is true of the material world, if the material world stands in

131 In Copy D the next two sentences are bracketed and the following change suggested (published by

involvement? Is it not the real world which exists for us, and is as it is for us, exclusively as the 
world objectivated, experienced and otherwise intended to in our consciousness? Is not 
consciousness itself, in its many different modes and syntheses in us, in its own essential 
coherence, that which gives us the world as the world obtaining for us and perhaps proving 
itself in us, and gives us its whole sense and with all evidences, proofs, groundings in this sense- 
bestowing — flowing concatenations in the stream of consciousness itself, in the current 
conscious life of the Ego (which comprises all ofits pure doing / Leisten 7)?
132Insertion in Copy D: immanental

contrast to all consciousness, and to the own-essentiality of conscious­
ness, as “something alien,” the “otherness,” then how can consciousness 
become involved with it — with the material world and consequently 
with the whole world other than consciousness? For one is easily 
persuaded that the material world is not just any part, but rather the 
fundamental stratum 133 of the natural world to which all other real 
being is essentially related. The components still lacking from the 
material world are the psyches of humans and brutes;134,135 and the 
novelty which they introduce is, above all, their “mental living” 
with their relatedness to their surrounding world in the manner 
peculiar to consciousness. Nevertheless consciousness and physicalness are a 
combined whole,136 combined into the single psychophysical unities 
which we call animalia and, at the highest level, combined into the 
real unity of the whole world. Can the unity of a whole exist otherwise 
than by virtue ofits parts, and must the latter not have some sort of 
community of essence instead of being heterogeneous of essential 
necessity?
To answer these questions I shall look for the ultimate source 
which feeds the general positing of the world effected by me in the 
natural attitude, the source which, therefore, makes it possible that I 
consciously find a factually existing world of physical things con­
fronting me and that I ascribe to myself a body in that world and now 
am able to assign myself a place there. Obviously this ultimate source 
is sensuous experience.131. For our purposes, however, it will be sufficient 
if we consider138 sensuous perception which plays the role among 
experiencing acts ofwhat may be called, in a certain legitimate sense,

a major part of their grounding force. Any perceiving consciousness 
has the peculiarity of being a consciousness of the own presence140 “in 
person” of an individual Object which is, for its part, either an indi- <71) 
viduum in the sense of pure logic or else a logico-categorial variant of 
such an individuum.141 In our case, that of sensuous perception or, 
more plainly, perception of a physical thing, the logical individuum 
is the physical thing; and it is sufficient to treat perception of the 
physical thing as the representative of all other perceptions (of 
qualities, processes, and the like).
O ur natural wakeful Ego-life is142 a continuous actional or non­
actional perceiving. Incessantly the world of physical things and, in 
it, our body, are perceptually there. How does, and how can, consci­
ousness itself become separated out143 as a concrete being in itself?144 And 
how does that which is intended to in it, the perceived being, become 
separated out as “over against” consciousness and as “in itself and by 
itselfr
At first I shall meditate as a “naive” hum an being. I see and 
apprehend the physical thing as given “in person.” To be sure, I am 
sometimes deceived, and not only with respect to perceived deter­
minations but also with respect to the factual being of the thing itself.
I suffer an illusion or hallucination. At such times perception is not 
“genuine” perception. But when it is, and that means when it allows 
of being “confirmed”145 in concatenations of actional experience, 
perhaps with the help of correct thinking based on experience, then 
the perceived physical thing is actual and, more particularly, actually 
itself given in perception “in person.” The perceiving,146 when I 
consider it purely as a consciousness and disregard my body and 
bodily organs, appears like something which is, in itself, inessen­
tial:147 an empty looking at the Object itself on the part of an empty 
“ Ego” which comes into a remarkable contact with the Object.148.

§40. “Primary” and “Secondary” Qualities. The Physical Thing Given “In 
Person ” a ^Mere Appearance” of the “ True Physical Thing” Determined In 
Physics.
If I, as a “naive149 human being” who is “deceived by the senses” 
have yielded to my inclinations to develop such reflections, I now 
recall, as a “scientific” human being the well-known distinction 
between secondary and primary qualities according to which the specific 
qualities pertaining to the senses are “ merely subjective,” and only 
the qualities dealt with in geometry and physics are “Objective.” 
The color, the sound, the odor, and the taste of the physical thing, 
however much they appear “in person” in the thing, as qualities 
<72) included in its essence, are not themselves actually as what they 
appear to be there, but are instead mere “signs” of certain primary 
qualities.150But if I recall certain familiar theories of physics, I see at 
once that such widely favored propositions should not be taken 
literally, as though only the “specific” sensuous qualities of the per­
ceived physical thing were a mere appearance; for that would be 
saying that the “prim ary” qualities, which remain after the “spec­
ific” sensuous qualities are removed along with other such qualities 
which do not appear, belong to the physical thing existing in ob­
jective truth. If the propositions are so understood, then the old 
Berkeleyian objection is correct that extension, the essential core of 
corporeality and of all primary qualities, is inconceivable without 
secondary qualities. Rather151 the entire essential contents of the perceived 
physical thing, thus the whole physical thing standing there “in 
person” and all its qualities, including all those which could ever be 
perceived, is a “mere appearance” and152 that the “ true physical thing” 
is the one <determined> by physics. When physics determines the physical 
thing given153 exclusively by such concepts as atoms, ions, energies, 
and so forth, and as, in any case, space-filling processes for which the 
only characterizations are mathematical expressions, it means them 
as something transcedent to the whole physical-thing content standing there “in 
person” As a consequence, it cannot mean the physical thing as 
something located in the natural space pertaining to the senses. In

other words, the space of physics cannot be the space belonging to the 
world given “in person” in perception: if it were, then the 
Berkeleyian objection would also apply to it.
Therefore “true being” would be something determined completely and, of 
essential necessity, differently from the actuality given “in person” in per­
ception154 given exclusively with sensuous determinations, to which 
spatial determinations pertaining to the senses also belong.155 156 The 
experienced physical thing proper provides the mere “ This” an empty X, which 
becomes the bearer of mathematical determinations and corresponding math­
ematical formulae, and which exists, not in perceived space, but in an 
“Objective space”157 of which <perceived space> is merely a “sign” — a 
three-dimensional Euclidean multiplicity which is representable only 
symbolically .158
Let us accept that. Let us assume, as the theory maintains, that 
whatever is given “in person” in any perception is “mere ap­
pearance,” of essential necessity “merely subjective,” though still not 
an empty illusion. By applying the strict method of natural science, <73) 
what is given in perception serves to validly determine — which 
anyone can do and test by insight —  that transcendent being of which 
it is the “sign.” The159 sensuous contents of the perceptually given 
itself are always held to be other than the true physical thing existing 
in itself; nevertheless, the substrate, the bearer (the empty X) of the 
perceived determinations, is always held to be that which is deter­
mined by the exact method as having the predicates assigned to it in 
physics. Conversely, then, any cognition in physics serves as an index to the 
course of possible experiences with the things pertaining to the senses and their 
occurrences found in those experiences. It serves, therefore, to orient us in 
the world of actional experience in which we all live and act.

§41. The Really Inherent Composition of Perception and Its Transcendent 
Object,160
Now, all of that being presupposed, what is included in the concrete, really 
inherent composition of perception itself, as the cogitatio? Obviously not the 
physical thing as determined by physics, that utterly transcendent 
thing — transcendent161 to the whole “world of appearance.” But not 
even the latter, although it is called “merely subjective,” with all the 
particular physical things and occurrences belonging to it, is 
excluded from the really inherent composition of perception; it is 
“ transcendent” to perception. Let us consider this more closely. We 
have already spoken,162 though only in passing, of the transcendence 
of the physical thing.163 We now must acquire a deeper insight into 
how the transcendent stands with respect to the consciousness which is a conscious­
ness of it, into how this mutual relationship, which has its paradoxes, 
should be understood.
Let us therefore exclude the whole of physics and the whole 
domain of theoretical thinking. Let us remain within the limits of 
simple intuition and the syntheses belonging to it, among which 
perception is included. It is evident then that intuition and intuited, 
perception and perceived physcial thing are, more particularly, 
essentially interrelated but, as a m atter of essential necessity, are not 
really inherently and essentially one and combined.
Let us start with an example. Constantly seeing this table and 
meanwhile walking around it, changing my position in space in 
whatever way, I have continually the consciousness of this one 
<74) identical table as factually existing “in person” and remaining quite 
unchanged. The table-perception, however, is a continually chang­
ing one; it is a continuity of changing perceptions. I close my eyes. 
My other senses have no relation to the table. Now I have no 
perception of it. I open my eyes; and I have the perception again. The 
perception? Let us be more precise. Returning, it is not, under any 
circumstances, individually the same. Only the table is the same, 
intended to as the same in the synthetical consciousness which 
connects the new perception with the memory. The perceived phys-

193 Addition in Copy D: of mere sensuous experience, the physical thing which in everyday life,

ical thing can exist without being perceived, without even being 
potentially intended to (in the already described164 mode of non- 
actionality); and it can exist without changing. The perception itself, 
however, is what it is in the continuous flux of consciousness and is 
itself a continuous flux: continually the perceptual Now changes into 
the enduring consciousness of the J ust-Past and simultaneously a new 
Now lights up, etc. Like the perceived thing as a whole, whatever 
parts, sides, moments accrue to it necessarily, and always for the same 
reasons, transcends the perception regardless of whether the par­
ticular property be called a primary or a secondary quality. The color 
of the seen physical thing is, of essential necessity, not a really 
inherent moment of the consciousness of color; it appears, but while it 
is appearing the appearance can and must, in the case of a legitimat­
ing experience, be continually changing. The same color appears “in” 
continuous multiplicities of color adumbrations. Something similar is 
true of every sensuous quality and also of every spatial shape. One 
and the same shape (given “in person” as the same) appears con­
tinuously but always “in a different m anner,” always in different 
adumbrations of shape. That is a necessary situation, and obviously 
it obtains universally. Only for the sake of simplicity have we taken as 
our example the case of a physical thing appearing in perception as 
unchanging. The application to cases involving changes of any kind 
is obvious.
O f essential necessity there belongs to any “all-sided ” continuously, uni- 
tarily, and self-confirming experimental consciousness [ Erfahrungsbewufitsein / 
of the same physical thing a multifarious system of continuous multiplicities of 
appearances and adumbrations in which165 all objective moments falling within <75) 
perception with the characteristic of being themselves given “in person” are166 
adumbrated by determined continuities.167 Each determination has its 
system of adumbrations; and each of them, like the physical thing as 
a whole, is there as the Same for the seizing-upon consciousness 
which synthetically unites memory and new perception as the Same, 
despite any interruption of the continuous course of actional per­
ception.
At the same time we now see what actually and indubitably is 
included in the really inherent composition of those concrete inten-

tive mental processes called perceivings of physical things. Whereas 
the physical thing is the intentional unity, the physical thing inten­
ded to as identical and unitary in the continuously regular flow of 
perceptual multiplicities168 which interpenetrate and change into 
one another, the perceptual multiplicities themselves always have 
their (terminate descriptional composition essentially coordinated with 
that unity. For example, each phase of the perception necessarily 
contains a determined content of adumbrations of color, adum bra­
tions of shape, etc. They are included among “the Data of sensations,” 
Data of an own peculiar region with determined genera and which 
join together with one of these genera to make up concrete unities of 
mental processes sui generis (“fields” of sensation). Furthermore, in a 
manner which we shall not describe here more precisely, the Data are 
animated by “construings” within the concrete unity of the perception 
and in the animation exercise the “presentive function,” or as united 
with the construings which animate them, they make up what we call 
“ appearings o f ’ color, shape, and so forth. These moments, combined 
with further characteristics, are the really inherent components 
making up the perception which is a consciousness of one and the 
same physical thing by virtue of joining together, grounded in the 
essence of those construings, to make up a unity of construing, and again 
by virtue of the possibility, grounded in the essence of various unities of 
construing, to make up syntheses of identification,169
It must be borne clearly in mind that170 the Data of sensation 
which exercise the function of adumbrations of color, of smoothness, 
of shape, etc. (the function of “presentation” ) are, of essential necess­
ity, entirely different from color simpliciter, smoothness simpliciter, 
shape simpliciter, and, in short, from all kinds of moments belonging 
to physical things. The adumbration, though called by the same name, of 
essential necessity is not of the same genus as the one to which the adumbrated 
belongs. The adumbrating is a mental process. But a mental process is 
possible only as a mental process, and not as something spatial. 
However, the adumbrated is of essential necessity possible only as 
<76) something spatial (it is spatial precisely in its essence), and not 
possible as a mental process. In particular it is a countersense to take
168Insertion in Copy A: perceived in the harmony of the perceptual continuity as existing and

the adumbration of shape (e.g., the adumbration of a triangle) for 
something spatial and possible in space; and whoever does so171 
confuses the adumbrating with the adumbrated, i.e., with the ap­
pearing shape. As for how the different really inherent moments of 
the perception as cogitatio (in contrast to the moments of the 
cogitatum, which is transcendent to it) are to be separated from one 
another and characterized with respect to their sometimes very 
difficult differences, is a theme for extensive investigations.
§42. Being as Consciousness and Being as Reality. Essentially Necessary 
Difference Between the Modes of Intuition.
O ur considerations have established that the physical thing172 is 
transcendent to the perception of it and consequently to any con­
sciousness whatever related to it; it is transcendent not merely in the 
sense that the physical thing cannot be found in fact as a really inherent 
component of consciousness; rather the whole situation is an object of 
eidetic insight: With an absolutely unconditional universality and necess­
ity it is the case that a physical thing cannot be given in any possible 
perception, in any possible consciousness, as something really inher­
ently immanent. Thus there emerges a fundamentally essential dif­
ference between being as mental process and being as a physical thing. O f 
essential necessity it belongs to the regional essence, M ental 
Process173 (specifically to the regional particularization, Cogitatio) 
that it can be perceived in an immanental perception; fundamentally 
and necessarily it belongs to the essence of a spatial physical thing 
that it cannot be so perceived. If, as we learn from a deeper analysis, 
it is of the essence of any intuition presentive of a physical thing that, 
along with the physical-thing datum , other data analogous to phys­
ical things can be seized upon in a corresponding turn of the regard in 
the manner, let us say, of detachable strata and lower levels in the 
constitution of the appearing physical thing — e.g., “sight thing” 
with its different particularizations — still precisely the same is true 
of them: They are of essential necessity transcendencies.
Before tracing this contrast between something immanent and
171 Insertion in Copy A: (the confusion continually pervades the literature of psychology)
lltInsertion in Copy A: as an object of sensuous experience
x73In Copy A Mental Process changed to anything subjective whatever and subjective mental 
living

something transcedent somewhat further, let us introduce the follow­
ing remark. Disregarding perception, we find intentive mental pro­
cesses of many kinds that, by virtue of their essence, exclude the really 
inherent immanence of their intentional objects no m atter what the 
objects may otherwise be.174 That holds, for example, of any pre­
sentation: of any memory, of the empathic seizing upon someone 
else’s consciousness, etc. Naturally we must not confuse this tran- <77 
scendence with the transcendence with which we are concerned here.
To the physical thing as physical thing, to any reality in the genuine 
sense, the sense of which we have yet to clarify and fix, there belongs 
essentially and quite “universally”175 the incapacity of being imma- 
nently perceived and accordingly of being found at all in the con­
catenation of mental processes. Thus the physical thing is said to be, 
in itself, unqualifiedly transcendent. Precisely in that the essentially 
necessary diversity among modes of being, the most cardinal of them 
all, becomes manifest: the diversity between consciousness and reality.176
O
u t  exposition has brought out the further fact that this contrast 
between something immanent and something transcendent includes 
an essentially fundamental difference between the corresponding kinds of given­
ness. Perception of something immanent and of something transcend­
ent do not differ merely in that the intentional object, which is there 
with the characteristic of something it itself, “in person,” is really 
inherently immanent in the perceiving in one case but not in the 
other: rather they are differentiated by modes of givenness the 
essential difference between which is carried over mutatis mutandis 
into all the presentiational modifications of perception, into the 
parallel memorial intuitions and phantasy intuitions. We perceive 
the physical thing by virtue ofits being “adum brated” in respect of 
all the determinations which, in a given case, “actually” and pro­
perly “fall within the scope o f ’ perception. A mental process is not 
adumbrated.171 It is neither an accident of the own peculiar sense of the 
physical thing nor a contingency of “our human constitution,” that

strict sense, referring to the highest and therefore the most radical, eidetic universalities or
necessities.
178Addition in Copy D: But we have not yet progressed far enough to apprehend that diversity
in its purity. On the natural basis upon which we are operating, my consciousness, my stream of
consciousness even when taken purely as immanental, and my pure Ego as pertaining to my 
consciousness, are still worldly determinations of the real human being.
177Insertion in Copy D: in this maimer

“our” perception can arrive at physical things themselves only 
through mere adumbrations178 of them. Rather is it evident and 
drawn from the essence of spatial physical things (even in the widest 
sense, which includes “sight things” ) that, necessarily a being of that 
kind can be given in perception only through an179 adumbration; 
and in like m anner it is evident from the essence ofcogitationes, from 
the essence of mental processes of any kind, that they exclude any­
thing like that. For an existent belonging to their region, in other 
words, anything like an “appearing,” a being presented, through180 
adumbrations makes no sense whatever. Where there is no spatial 
being it is senseless to speak of a seeing from different standpoints 
with a changing orientation in accordance with different perappea- 
rances,181 adumbrations. On the other hand,182 it is an essential 
necessity, to be seized upon as essential in apodictic insight, that any 
spatial being whatever is perceivable for an Ego (for any possible 
Ego) only with the kind of givenness designated. A spatial being183 
can “appear” only in a certain “orientation,” which necessarily 
predelineates a system of possible new orientations each of which, in 
turn, corresponds to a certain “mode of appearance” which we can 
express, say, as givenness from such and such a “side,” and so forth. If 
we understand modes of appearance in the sense of modes of mental 
processes (the phrase can also have a corresponding ontic sense, as is 
evident from the description just offered), then this signifies: It is 
essential to certain sorts of mental processes which have a peculiar 
structure, more precisely, it belongs to certain concrete perceptions 
which have a peculiar structure,184 that what is intended to in them is 
meant as a spatial physical thing; to their essence belongs the ideal 
possibility of their changing into determinately ordered185 cont­
inuous multiplicities of perception which can always be continued, 
thus which are never completed. It is then inherent in the essential 
structure of those multiplicities that they bring about the unity of a 
harmoniously presentive consciousness and, more particularly, of the one

perceptual physical thing appearing ever more perfectly, from ever 
new sides, with an ever greater wealth of determinations.186 On the 
other hand, the spatial thing187 is nothing other than an intentional 
unity which of essential necessity can be given only as the unity of 
such modes of appearance.188
§43. The Clarification of a Fundamental Error.
It is therefore fundamentally erroneous to believe that perception 
(and, after its own fashion, any other kind of intuition of a physical 
thing) does not reach the physical thing itself. The latter is not given 
to us in itself or in its being-in-itself. There belongs to any existent the 
essential possibility of being simply intuited as what it is and, more 
particularly, of being perceived as what it is in an adequate percep­
tion, one that is presentive of that existent itself, “in person,” without 
any mediation by “appearances ” God, the subject possessing an ab­
solutely perfect knowledge and therefore possessing every possible 
adequate perception, naturally has that adequate perception of the 
very physical thing itself which is denied to us finite beings.
But this view is a countersense. It implies that there is no essential 
difference between something transcendent and something immanent, 
that, in the postulated divine intuition, a spatial physical thing is 
present as a really inherent constituent, that it is therefore itself a 
mental process also belonging to the divine stream of consciousness 
and divine mental processes generally. The holders of this view are 
misled by thinking that the transcendence belonging to the spatial 
physical thing is the transcendence belonging to something depicted or 
represented by a sign. Frequently the picture-theory is attacked with 
<79) zeal and a sign theory substituted for it. Both theories, however, are 
not only incorrect but countersensical. The spatial physical thing 
which we see is, with all its transcendence, still something perceived, 
given “in person” in the manner peculiar to consciousness. It is not 
the case that, in its stead, a picture or a sign is given. A picture-

consciousness or a sign-consciousness must not be substituted for 
perception.
Between perception, on the one hand, and depictive-symbolic or 
signitive-symbolic objectivation, on the other hand,189 there is an un­
bridgeable essential difference. In the latter kinds of objectivation we 
intuit something in consciousness as depicting or signitively indicat­
ing something else; having the one in our field of intuition we are 
directed, not to it, but to the other, what is depicted or designated, 
through the medium of a founded apprehending. Nothing like that is 
involved either in perception or in simple memory or in simple 
phantasy.190
In immediately intuitive acts we intuit an “it itself;” on their 
apprehendings no mediate apprehendings are built up at a higher 
level; thus there is no consciousness of anythin gfor which the intuited 
might function as a “sign” or “picture.” And just on that account it is 
said to be immediately intuited as “it itself.” In perception the “it 
itself’ is further characterized in its peculiarity as “in person” in 
contrast to its modified characteristic as “floating before us,” as 
“presentiated” in memory or in free phantasy.191 One would fall into 
a countersense if one were to confuse these modes of objectivation of 
essentially different structures, and if one were, accordingly, to mix 
up, in the usual fashion, the correlative objects given in these modes: 
thus confusing simple presentiation with symbolizing (whether de­
pictive or signitive) and — even worse — simple perception with 
both ot them. The perception of a physical thing does not presentiate 
something non-present, as though it were a memory or a phantasy;192 
perception makes present, seizes upon an it-itself in its presence “in 
person.” Perception does this according to its own peculiar sense; and to <80) 
attribute something other than that to perception is precisely to 
contradict its sense. If we are dealing, as here, with the perception of

tuition^, and offered a detailed report of my further research — which, incidentally, has 
meanwhile exerted both a terminological and a material influence on the literature. I hope to 
be able to publish these and other investigations, long since utilized in my lectures, in the next 
volumes of the Jahrbuch.

a physical thing then it is inherent in its essence to be an adumbrative 
perception; and, correlatively, it is inherent in the sense of its in­
tentional object, the physical thing as given in it, to be essentially 
perceivable only by perceptions of that kind, thus by adumbrative 
perceptions.
§44. Merely Phenomenal Being of Something Transcendent, Absolute Being of 
Something Immanent,193
Moreover, and this is also an essential necessity, the perception of a 
physical thing involves a certain inadequacy. O f necessity a physical 
thing can be given only “one-sidedly;” and that signifies, not just 
incompletely or imperfectly in some sense or other, but precisely 
what presentation by adumbrations prescribes. A physical thing is 
necessarily given in mere “modes of appearance” in which necessari­
ly a core of “what is actually presented” is apprehended as being sur­
rounded by a horizon of “ co-givenness” which is not givenness proper, and 
of more or less vague indeterminateness. And the sense of this indeter­
minateness is, again, predelineated by the universal essence of this 
type of perception which we call physical-thing perception. Indeed, 
the indeterminateness necessarily signifies a determinableness which has 
a rigorously prescribed style. It points ahead to possible perceptual multi­
plicities which, merging continuously into one another, join together 
to make up the unity of one perception in which the continuously 
enduring physical thing is always showing some new “sides” (or else 
an old “side” as returning) in a new series of adumbrations. Accord­
ingly, those moments of the physical thing which are also seized 
upon, but not in the proper sense of the word, gradually become 
actually presented, i.e., actually given; the indeterminacies become 
more precisely determined and are themselves eventually converted 
into clearly given determinations; conversely, to be sure, the clear is 
changed again into the unclear, the presented into the non­
presented, etc. To be in infinitum imperfect in this manner is part of the 
unanullable essence of the correlation between “physical thing” and perception of 
a physical thing. If the sense of the physical thing is determined by the
l93In Copy A this section is retitled: The Merely Phenomenal Givenness of Something 
Transcendent as the Absolute Givenness of Something Immanent. Marginal note in Copy A: 
None of §44 can be used!

data of physical-thing perception (and what else could determine it?), 
then that sense demands such an imperfection and neccessarily refers 
us to continuously unitary concatenations of possible perceptions <81) 
which, starting from any perception effected, extend in infinitely 
many directions in a systematically and rigidly regular m anner194 and, 
moreover, extend in every direction without limit, being always do­
minated throughout by a unity of sense. Necessarily there always 
remains a horizon of determinable indeterminateness, no matter how 
far we go in our experience, no matter how extensive the continua of 
actual perceptions of the same thing may be through which we have 
passed. No god can alter that no more than the circumstance that 
1 +  2 =  3, or that any other eidetic truth obtains.
It can already be seen universally that, no m atter what its genus 
may be, the being of something transcendent, understood as a being 
for an Ego, can become given only in a m anner analogous to that in 
which a physical thing is given, therefore through appearances.195 
Otherwise it would be precisely a being of something which might 
become immanent; but anything that is perceivable immanently is 
perceivable only immanently. Only if one is guilty of the above­
indicated confusions, which now have been cleared up, can one 
believe it possible for one and the same affair to be given on one 
occasion by196 appearance in the form of a perception of something 
transcendent and, on another occasion, by a perception ofsomething 
immanent.
First of all, let us still develop the other side of the specific contrast 
between a physical thing and a mental process. No mental process, we 
said, is presented [stellt sich... nicht dar\,197 That means that the 
perception of a mental process is a simple seeing of something 
which198 is (or can become) perceptually given as something absolute, and

which is itself presented by adumbration with respect to all that which it is. Human beings, 
other persons, to be sure, are not themselves given to me as unities of adumbration with respect

If I look at it, I have201 something absolute; it has no sides that could 
be presented sometimes in one mode and sometimes in another.202 I 
can think something true or something false about a feeling, but what 
I see when I look at it is there, with its qualities, its intensity, etc., 
absolutely.203 A violin tone, in contrast, with its objective identity, is 
given by adumbration, has its changing modes of appearance. These 
differ in accordance with whether I approach the violin or go farther 
away from it, in accordance with whether I am in the concert hall 
itself or am listening through the closed doors, etc. No one mode of 
appearance can claim to be the one that presents the tone absolutely 
although, in accordance with my practical interests, a certain ap­
pearance has a certain primacy as the normal appearance: in the 
<82) concert hall and at the “right” spot I hear the tone “itself5 as it 
“actually” sounds. In the same way we say that any physical thing in 
relation to vision has a normal appearance; we say of the color, the 
shape, the whole physical thing which we see in normal daylight and 
in a normal orientation relative to us, that this is how the thing 
actually looks; this is its actual color, and the like. But that points to 
what is only a kind o/204 secondary objectivation within the limits of total 
objectivation of the physical thing, as we can easily be persuaded. 
For, indeed, it is clear that if we were to retain the “normal” mode of 
appearance while cutting off the other multiplicities of appearances 
and the essential relationships to them, none of the sense of the 
givenness of the physical thing would remain.205
We therefore hold fast to the following: Whereas it is essential to 
givenness by appearances that no appearance presents the affair as 
something “absolute” instead of in a one-sided presentation, it is

essential to the giveness of something immanent precisely to present 
something absolute which cannot ever be presented with respect to 
sides or be adum brated.206 It is indeed evident also that the adum ­
brative sensation-contents themselves, which really inherently 
belong to the mental process of perceiving a physical thing, function, 
more particularly, as adumbrations of something but are not them­
selves given in turn by adumbrations.207
The following distinction should also be noted. It is the case also of 
a mental process that it is never perceived completely, that it cannot 
be adequately208 seized upon in its full unity.209 A mental process is, 
with respect to its essence, in flux which we,210 directing the reflective 
regard to it, can swim along after it starting from the Now-point, 
while the stretches already covered are lost to our perception. Only in 
the form of retention do we have a consciousness of the phase which 
has just flowed away, or else211 in the form of a retrospective re­
collection. And my whole stream of mental processes is, finally, a 
unity of mental processes which, of essential necessity, cannot be 
seized upon completely in a perceiving which “swims along with it.”
But this incompleteness or “imperfection,” pertaining to the essence 
of the perception of a mental process, is radically different from the 
incompleteness or “imperfection” pertaining to the essence of the 
perception of something “transcendent,” perception by means of 
adumbrative presentation, by means of something such as 
appearance.
All the modes of givenness, and all the differences among modes of 
givenness, which we find in the sphere of perception are also present, 
but in a modified fashion, in the sphere of reproductive modifications. The 
presentiations of physical things make those things “present” by 
virtue of presentations such that the adumbrations themselves, the <83) 
apprehensions and, accordingly, the whole phenomenon, are repro- 
ductively modified throughout. We also have reproductions of mental 
processes and acts of reproductively intuiting mental processes in the 
manner characteristic of presentation and of reflection in presentia-

tion. Naturally we do not find any reproductive adumbrations here.
We now add the following contrast. Gradual differences in relative 
clarity or obscurity belong to the essence of presentiations. Obviously 
this difference in perfection has nothing to do with the one related to 
givenness by virtue of adumbrative appearances. A more or less clear 
objectivation is not adumbrated by the degree of clarity, namely in 
the sense which determines our terminology, according to which a 
spatial shape, any quality which covers a shape, and therefore the 
whole “appearing physical thing as appearing” is manifoldly adum ­
brated — whether the objectivation of them is clear or obscure. A 
reproductive objectivation of a physical thing has its various possible 
degrees of clarity and, more particularly, for each of its modes of 
adum bration’. One sees that it is a m atter of differences that lie in 
different dimensions. It is also obvious that the distinctions we make 
within the sphere of perception itself under the headings of “clear 
and unclear” , “distinct and indistinct” seeing do indeed exhibit a 
certain analogy with the differences in clarity of which we were just 
now speaking in so far as, in both cases, it is a matter of gradual 
increases and decreases in the fullness with which the objectivated 
affair is given; but these differences also belong to other dimensions.
§45. Unperceived Mental Processes, Unperceived Reality.
If we penetrate more deeply into this situation we also understand 
the following difference in essence between mental processes and 
physical things with respect to their perceivableness.
The kind of being belonging to mental processes is such that a 
seeing regard of perception can be directed quite immediately to any 
actual mental process as an originary living present. This occurs in 
the form of “reflection,”212 which has the remarkable property that 
what is seized upon perceptually in reflection is characterized funda­
mentally not only as something which exists and endures while it is 
being regarded perceptually but also as something which already 
existed before this regard was turned to it. “All mental processes are 
intended to:” This signifies, then, that in the specific case of intentive 
<84> mental processes not only are they consciousness of something and
212Insertion in Copy A: (stated more explicitly, reflection on a mental process) Marginal note in 
Copy A: Cf. §77, p. 144

present213 as consciousness of something when they themselves are 
the Objects of a reflecting consciousness, but also that they are there 
already as a “background” when they are not reflected on and thus 
of essential necessity are “ready to be perceived” in a sense which is, in the 
first place, analogous to the one in which unnoticed physical things in 
our external field of regard are ready to be perceived. Physical things 
can be ready to be perceived only in so far as already, as unnoticed 
things, they are intended to and this signifies: only if they are 
appearing. Not all physical things fulfill this condition: the “field of 
attentive regard” embracing everything which appears is not in­
finite. On the other hand, the mental process which is not reflected on 
also must fulfill certain conditions of readiness, although in quite 
different ways and as befits its essence. After all, it cannot be “ap­
pearing.” Nevertheless it fulfills those conditions at all times by the 
mere mode ofits existence; it fulfills them, more particularly, for the 
particular Ego to which it belongs, the Ego-regard which, per­
chance, lives “in” it. Only because reflection and the mental process 
have those essential peculiarities which have been mentioned here, is 
it possible for us to know something about mental processes, includ­
ing reflections themselves, which are not reflected on. That repro­
ductive (and retentional) modifications of mental processes have the 
same determination, correspondingly modified, is obvious.
Let us develop that contrast further. We see that the sort of being 
which belongs to the mental process is such that the latter is essentially capable of 
being perceived in reflection. The physical thing is also essentially capable 
of being perceived, and it is seized upon in perception as a physical thing 
belonging to my surrounding world. Even without being perceived it 
belongs to that world; and, therefore, even when it is not perceived it is 
there for the Ego. But still not in such a manner that, in general, a 
regard of simple heeding could be directed to it. The background 
field, understood as a field of simple observability, includes only a 
small piece of my surrounding world. That the unperceived physical 
thing “is there” means rather that, from my actually present per­
ceptions, with the actually appearing background field, possible and, 
moreover, 
continuously-harmoniously 
motivated 
perception- 
sequences, with ever new fields of physical things (as unheeded 
backgrounds), lead to those concatenations of perceptions in which 
the physical thing in question would make its appearance and
213In Copy D present cancelled.

become seized upon.214 Fundamentally, nothing essential is altered 
if, instead of a single Ego, a plurality of Egos is taken into con­
sideration. Only by virtue of the relationship of possible mutual 
understanding can my experienced world become identified with 
that of others and, at the same time, enriched by their more extensive 
experience. Thus a transcendency which lacked the above-described 
<85) connection by harmonious motivational concatenations with my 
current sphere of actually present perceptions would be a completely 
groundless assumption; a transcendency which lacked such a con­
catenation essentially would be nonsensical. Such then is the kind of 
presence characterizing what is not currently perceived pertaining to 
the world of physical things; it is something essentially different from 
the necessarily intended-to being of mental processes.215
§46. Indubitability of the Perception of Something Immanent, Dubitability of 
the Perception of Something Transcendent.
From all of this there emerge important consequences. Every per­
ception of something immanent necessarily guarantees the existence 
ol its object. If reflective seizing-upon is directed to a mental process 
of mine, I have seized upon something absolute itself, the factual 
being of which is essentially incapable of being negated, i.e., the 
insight that it is essentially impossible for it not to exist; it would be a 
countersense to believe it possible that a mental process given in that 
manner does not in truth exist. The stream of mental processes which is 
mine, of the one who is thinking, no matter to what extent it is not 
grasped, no m atter how unknown it is in the areas of the stream 
which have run their course and which have yet to come — : as soon 
as I look at the flowing life in its actual present216 and, while doing so, 
apprehend myself as the pure subject of this life (later we shall busy 
ourselves particularly with what that means), I say unqualifiedly 
and necessarily that I am, this life217 is, I am living: cogito.
214Marginal note in Copy D: What the essential foundation is for the fact that one’s attentive 
regard becomes directed to this or.that in the background field of regard (“affection” and 
essential conditions governing affection), is a special problem and will not be treated here.

To each stream of mental processes and to each Ego, as Ego, there 
belongs the essential possibility of acquiring this evidence; each bears 
in itself, as an essential possibility, the guarantee218 of its absolute 
factual being. But, one might ask, is it not conceivable that an Ego 
have only phantasies in its stream of mental processes, that this 
stream consists ofnothing but inventive intuitions? Such an Ego would 
find only phantasies [Fiktionen] of cogitationes; its reflections, 
because of the nature of these mental processes as the medium <in 
which it reflected) \bei der Natur des Erlebnismediums], would be 
exclusively reflections in imagination. — But that is an obvious 
countersense. What hovers before one may be a mere figment; the 
hovering itself, the inventive consciousness, is not itself invented and 
there belongs to its essence, as to any other mental process, the 
possibility of a perceiving reflection which seizes upon absolute 
factual being. No countersense219 is implicit in the possibility that 
every other consciousness, which I posit in empathic experience, is 
non-existent.220 But my empathizing, my consciousness of whatever 
sort,221 is originarily and absolutely given not only with respect to its 
essence but also with respect to its existence. Only for an Ego, or a 
stream of mental processes, in relation to itself, does this distinctive <86) 
state of affairs exist; here alone there is, and here there must be, such a 
thing as perception of something immanent.222

222Addition in Copy D: As a consequence, however, I must not attribute to my mental processes
anything which I do not seize upon absolutely, anything which they do not make up of
themselves in their own-essentialness — that they are a component of the real human being,
psychophysically united with one’s organism, that the Data of sensation are caused physically
and psychophysically in Nature, and the like, does not itself belong to the mental process with
respect to its own absolute essence; and if I have knowledge of it, if I “apprehend” my mental
processes accordingly as pertaining to human being (I as a human being) and have the most
certain convictions about this, then precisely these apprehendings, these convictions, are new
mental-process moments which I can bring to light as really immanent Data, whereas I
experience the real world, including all of my human self, only transcendently and non-
apodictically. — To be sure, this exposition forces us to go further, and actually it is not
adequate; yet what is brought out here is not to be taken lightly. The being of mental processes
may involve identifiability and therefore an ability to go back to them again; it may be that the
absoluteness of components belonging to recollection and an apodictic content are presup­
posed and, above all, if I am to speak of my life, my stream of mental processes, my identical
being as an Ego, in their own essential purity: But one sees in advance that here an answer may
be possible and that there is a content, in itself absolutely concrete and self-containedly unitary,
in itself indefeasibly existent, as the content in which alone I can experience, know, and in
acting presuppose, the world and my human being as a worldly real existence, and that thus
there is a pure, own essential being prior to the being of the world.

In contradistinction, as we know, it is of the essence of the physical 
world that no perception, however perfect, presents anything ab­
solute in that realm; and essentially connected with this is the fact 
that any experience, however extensive, leaves open the possibility 
that what is given does not exist in spite of the continual consciousness 
ofits own presence “in person.” According to eidetic law it is the case 
that physical existence223 is never required as necessary by the givenness of 
something physical, but is always in a certain manner contingent. 
This means: It can always be that the further course of experience 
necessitates giving up what has already been posited with a legitimacy 
derived from experience. Afterwards one says it was a mere illusion, a 
hallucination, merely a coherent dream, or the like. Furthermore, as 
a continuously open possibility in this sphere of givenness, there exists 
such a thing as alteration of construing, a sudden changing of one 
appearance into another which cannot be united harmoniously with 
it and thus an influx of the latter upon the earlier experiential 
positings owing to which the intentional objects of these earlier 
positings suffer afterwards, so to speak, a transformation — occur­
rences all of which are essentially excluded from the sphere of mental 
processes.224 In this absolute sphere225 there is no room for conflict, 
illusion, or being otherwise. It is a sphere of absolute positing.
Thus in every manner it is clear that whatever is there for me in the 
world of physical things226 is necessarily only a presumptive actuality 
and, on the other hand, that I myself, for whom it is there (I, when the 
“part of me” belonging to the world of physical things is excluded)227 
am absolute actuality or that the present phase of my mental processes 
is an absolute actuality, given by an unconditional, absolutely inde­
feasible positing.
Over against the positing of the world, which is a “ contingent” positing, there 
stands then the positing of my pure Ego and Ego-life which is a “necessary ” 
absolutely indubitable positing. Anything physical which is given “in 
person” can be non-existent ;228 no mental process which is given “in person” can

be non-existent. This is the eidetic law defining this necessity and that 
contingency.229
Obviously that does not imply that the necessity of the being of this 
or that present mental process is a pure essential necessity, that is: a 
purely eidetic particularity subsumed under an eidetic law; it is the 
necessity of a fact, and is called so because an eidetic law is involved in 
the fact and indeed, in this case, involved in the existence of the fact as 
fact. The ideal possibility of a reflection having the essential charac- <87) 
teristic of an evidently indefeasible positing of factual existence is 
grounded in the essence of any230 Ego whatever and of any mental 
process whatever.231
The deliberations just carried out also make it clear that no 
conceivable proofs gathered from experiential consideration of the 
world could make the existence of the world certain for us with an 
absolute assurance. The world is dubitable not in the sense that 
rational motives are present to be taken into consideration over 
against the tremendous force of harmonious experiences, but rather 
in the sense that a doubt is conceivable because, of essential necessity, 
the possibility of the non-being of the world is never excluded.232 Any 
force of experience, no m atter how great, can gradually become 
counterbalanced and outweighed. The absolute being of mental 
processes is in no respect altered thereby; in fact, they always remain 
presupposed by all of that.
O ur considerations now have succeeded in reaching a point of 
culmination. We have acquired the cognitions we needed. Already 
included in the concatenations of essences disclosed to us are the most 
important premises from which we shall draw the inferences con-

ca. 1917): One should notice in what sense, and what particular sense this contingency 
pertaining to the positing of the world possesses. (See above, on this page). One must never tear 
such sentences out of context. The physical thing must exist if the continuity of experience goes 
on harmoniously ad infinitum. (Miss Stein believes that this might become misunderstood.)

rational motives are present, to be taken into consideration over against the tremendous force 
of harmonious experiences; the world even has an empirical dubitability since it <is> apodicti-

experienced physical things and of the <world>; but dubitability exists in the sense that a 
becoming doubtful and a becoming null are conceivable; the possibility of non-being, as an 
essential possibility, is never excluded. [Glosses by Schuhmann.]

cerning the essential detachableness of the whole natural world from 
the domains of consciousness, of the sphere of being pertaining to 
mental processes; we can persuade ourselves that, in these inferences, 
justice is at last done to a core of Descartes’s Meditations (which were 
directed to entirely different ends) which only lacked a pure, 
effective development. Subsequently, to be sure, we shall need some 
easily acquired additional supplementations in order to reach our 
final goal. In a preliminary way we draw our consequences within 
the bounds of a restricted application.

CHAPTER THREE
§47. The Natural World as a Correlate of Consciousness.
Taking the results of the last chapter as our point of departure, we 
may take the following into consideration. The de facto course of our 
human experiences is such that it constrains our reason to go beyond 
intuitionally given physical things 
(those of the Cartesian 
imaginatio) and base them on the “truth of physics.” But that course <88) 
might be different. It is not as though human development had never 
progressed, nor would ever progress, beyond the prescientific stage so 
that, while the world of physics indeed had its truth, we should never 
know anything about it. And it is not as though the world of physics 
were different and ordered according to laws different from the ones 
that in fact obtain. Rather it is conceivable that our intuited world 
were the ultimate one, “behind” which would be no world of physics 
whatever, i.e., that perceived physical things would lack m athem at­
ical or physical determination, that the data of experience would 
exclude any physics belonging to the same kind with ours. The 
concatenations of experience would then be correspondingly other 
and different in kind from what they in fact are in so far as the 
experiential motives fundamental to the fashioning of the concepts 
and judgments of physics would be absent. But, on the whole, within 
the limits of the presentive intuitions which we comprehend under the 
name “simple experience” (perception, recollection, etc.), “physical 
things” can still be presented as they are now as intentional unities 
persisting continuously in multiplicities of appearances.1
1 
Addition in Copy A to this sentence: persisting, that is, undergoing consistent confirmation 
during our actual and foreseeable living. Addition in Copy D: thus in me and in the multiplicities 
of appearances of the others being demonstrated in the first place in me, being “empathically” 
demonstrated purely for me as pure subject, therefore <as> multiplicities of appearances being 
manifested in presentations of their own specific kind.

But we can go further in this direction: No limits check us in the2 
process of conceiving the destruction of the Objectivity of something 
physical — as the correlate of experimental consciousness. It must 
always be borne in mind here that whatever physical things are — the 
only physical things about which we can make statements, the only 
ones about the being or non-being, the being-thus or being-otherwise 
of which we can disagree and make rational decisions — they are as 
experienceablephysical things. It is experience alone that prescribes their 
sense; and, since we are speaking of physical things in fact, it is actual 
experience alone which does so in its definitely ordered experiential 
concatenations. But if the kinds of mental processes included under 
experience, and especially the fundamental mental process of per­
ceiving physical things, can be submitted by us to an eidetic consider­
ation, and if we can discern essential possibilities and necessities in 
them (as we obviously can) and can therefore eidetically trace the 
essentially possible variants of motivated experiential concatenat­
ions: then the result is the correlate of our factual experience, called 
“ the actual world ” as one special case among a multitude of possible worlds and 
surrounding worlds which, for their part, are nothing else but the 
correlates of essentially possible variants of the idea, “an experiencing conscious- 
<89) ness,” with more or less orderly concatenations of experience. As a 
consequence, one must not let oneself be deceived by speaking of the 
physical thing as transcending consciousness or as “existing in itself.” 
The genuine concept of the transcendence of something physical 
which is the measure of the rationality of any statements about 
transcendence, can itself be derived only from the proper essential 
contents of perception or from those concatenations of definite kinds 
which we call demonstrative experience. The idea of such tran­
scendence is therefore the eidetic correlate of the pure idea of this 
demonstrative experience.
This is true of any conceivable kind of transcendence which could 
be treated as either an actuality or a possibility. An object existing in 
itself is never one with which consciousness or the Ego pertaining to consciousness 
has nothing to do. The physical thing is a thing belonging to the 
surrounding world even if it be an unseen physical thing, even if it be a 
really possible, unexperienced but experienceable, or perhaps 
experienceable, physical thing. Experienceableness never means a mere 
logical possibility, but rather a possibility motivated in the concatenat-
2Insertion in Copy A: imaginative

ions of experience.3 This concatenation itself is, through and 
through, one oF “motivation,”5 always taking into itself new mo­
tivations and recasting those already formed. With respect to their 
apprehension-contents or determination-contents, the motivations 
differ, are more or less rich, are more or less definite or vague in 
content depending on whether it is a m atter of physical things which 
are already “known” or “completely unknow n/’ “still undiscov­
ered” or in the case of the seen physical thing, whether it is a matter of 
what is known or unknown about it. It is exclusively a matter of the 
essential structures of such concatenations which, with respect to all 
their possibilities, can be made the objects of a purely eidetic explo­
ration. It is inherent in the essence that anything whatever which 
exists in reality but is not yet actually experienced can become given 
and that this means that the thing in question belongs to the undeter­
mined but determinable horizon of my experiential actuality at the 
particular time. This horizon, however, is the correlate of the compo­
nents of undeterminateness essentially attached to experiences of 
physical things themselves; and those components — again, essenti- <90) 
ally — leave open possibilities of fulfillment which are by no means 
completely undetermined but are, on the contrary, motivated possi­
bilities predelineated with respect to their essential type. Any actual 
experience points beyond itself to possible experiences which, in turn, 
point to new possible experiences and so ad infinitum. And all of that 
is effected involving species and regulative forms restricted to certain 
a priori types.
Any hypothetical formulation in practical life or in empirical 
science relates to this changing but always co-posited horizon 
whereby the positing of the world receives its essential sense.
3Marginal note in Copy A: rationally motivated
*Insertion in Copy D: purely immanental
5a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : It should be noted that this fundamental phenomenological concept of 
motivation, which arose immediately with the isolation of the purely phenomenological sphere 
in the Logische Untersuchungen (and in contrast to the concept of causality, as relating to the 
transcendent sphere of reality), is a universalization of that concept of motivation in accordance 
with which we can say, e.g., that the willing of the end motivates the willing of the means. 
Incidentally, the concept of motivation undergoes, for essential reasons, a variety of modificat­
ions; the corresponding equivocations become harmless, and even appear to be necessary as 
soon as the phenomenological situations are clarified.

§48. The Logical Possibility and the Material Countersense of a World 
Outside Ours.
The hypothetical assumption of something real outside this world is, 
of course, “logically” possible; obviously it involves no6 formal con­
tradiction. But when we ask about the essential conditions on which 
its validity would depend, about the mode of demonstration de­
manded by its sense, when we ask about the mode of demonstration 
taken universally essentially determined by the positing of something 
transcendent — no matter how we might legitimately universalize its 
essence — we recognize7 that something transcendent necessarily 
must be experienceable8 not merely by an Ego conceived as an empty 
logical possibility but by9 any actual Ego as a demonstrable unity 
relative to its10 concatenations of experience. But one can see (here, to 
be sure, we are not yet advanced enough to establish it in detail; only 
our later analyses can provide all the premises for doing so) that what 
is cognizable by one11 Ego must, of essential necessity, be cognizable by 
any Ego.12 Even though it is not infact the case that each stands, or can 
stand, in a relationship of “em pathy,” of mutual understanding with 
every other, as, e.g., not having such relationship to mental lives 
living on the planets of the remotest stars, nevertheless there exist, 
eidetically regarded, essential possiblities of effecting a mutual understand­
ing and therefore possibilities also that the worlds of experience 
separated in fact become joined by concatenation of actual 
experience to make up the one intersubjective world, the correlate of 
the unitary world of mental lives (the universal broadening of the 
community of human beings13). When that is taken into account the

Ego” also derives its legitimacy from sources belonging to my experience; the demonstration of 
the other (a demonstration which, to begin with, must not be understood as being any logical 
actus) is effected in me. And if I then reduce natural human existence to the proper essentiality 
of an Ego and a life, as I do in my own case, I see that I can do likewise in the case of any other 
human being who becomes demonstrated to me and that I thus attain the pure Ego-plurality.

formal-logical possibility of realities outside the world, the one spa- 
tiotemporal world, which is fixed by our actual experience, materially <91 > 
proves to be a countersense. If there are any worlds, any real physical 
things whatever, then the experienced motivations constituting them 
must be able to extend into my experience and into that of each Ego14 
in the general manner characterized above. Obviously there are 
physical things and worlds of physical things which do not admit of 
being definitely demonstrated in any human experience; but that has 
purely factual grounds which lie within the factual limits of such 
experience.
§49. Absolute Consciousness as the Residuum After the Annihilation of the 
World.
On the other hand, all of that does not imply that there must be some 
world or some physical thing or other. The existence of a world is the 
correlate of certain multiplicities of experience distinguished by 
certain essential formations. But it cannot be seen that actual 
experiences15 can flow only in such concatenated forms; nothing like 
that can be seen purely on the basis of the essence of perception taken 
universally, and of the essences of other collaborating kinds of 
experiential intuition. It is instead quite conceivable that experience, 
because of conflict, might dissolve into illusion not only in detail, and 
that it might not be the case, as it is de facto,16 that every illusion 
manifests a deeper truth and that every conflict, in the place where it 
occurs, is precisely what is demanded by more inclusive contextures 
in order to preserve the total harmony; in our experiencing it is 
conceivable that there might be a host of irreconcilable conflicts not 
just for us but in themselves, that experience might suddenly show 
itself to be17 refractory to the demand that it carry on its positings of 
physical things harmoniously, that its context might lose its fixed 
regular organizations of adumbrations, apprehensions, and ap­
pearances18 — in short, that there might no longer be any19 world.

Nevertheless, in that case it could be that, to some extent, crude 
unity-formations become constituted, transient supports for intuit­
ions which were mere analogues of intuitions of physical things 
because quite incapable of constituting conservable “realities,” en­
during unities “which exist in themselves, whether or not they are 
perceived.”
Now let us add the results reached at the end of the last chapter; let 
us recall the possibility of non-being of everything physically tran­
scendent: it then becomes evident that while the being of consciousness, of 
any stream of mental processes whatever, would indeed be necessarily 
modified by an annihilation of the world of physical things it own existence would 
<92) not be touched. Modified, to be sure. For an annihilation of the world 
means, correlatively, nothing else but that in each stream of mental 
processes (the full stream — the total stream, taken as endless in both 
directions, which comprises the mental processes of an Ego), certain 
ordered concatenations of experience and 
therefore certain 
complexes of theorizing reason oriented according to those concate­
nations of experience, would be excluded. But that does not mean 
that other mental processes and concatenations of mental processes 
would be excluded. Consequently no real being, no being which is 
presented and legitimated in consciousness by appearances, is neces­
sary to the being of consciousness itself (in the broadest sense, the stream of 
mental processes).
Immanental being is therefore indubitably absolute being in the sense that by 
essential necessity immanental being nulla “re” indiget ad existendum.
In contradistinction, the world of transcendent “ res” is entirely referred to 
consciousness and, more particularly, not to some logically conceived conscious­
ness but to actual consciousness.
In so far as its most universal sense is concerned, that has already 
been made clear by the exposition above (in the preceding sections). 
A something transcendent is given20 by virtue of certain concatena­
tions of experience. As given directly21 and with increasing perfection 
in perceptual continua which show themselves to be harmonious and 
in certain methodical forms of thinking based on experience, a 
something transcendent acquires, more or less immediately, its in­
sightful, continually progressive determination. Let us assume that 
consciousness, with its constituent mental processes and with the course it
20Insertion in Copy A: though, of essential necessity, only with a proviso
21 In Copy A directly substituted by originaliter

runs, is actually of such a nature that the conscious subject, in his free 
activity of theoretical experiencing and of thinking oriented accord­
ing to experience,22 could effect all such concatenations (in which 
connection we should also have to take into account the reinforce­
ment received by mutual understanding with other Egos and other 
streams of mental processes) ;23let us assume, furthermore, that the 
pertinent regularities of consciousness are actually m aintained,24 
that, in the course of consciousness taken universally, nothing what­
ever is lacking which is requisite for the appearance of a unitary 
world and for the rational theoretical cognition of such a world. All 
that being assumed, we now ask: is it still conceivable and not rather a 
countersense that the corresponding transcendent world does not exist?
Thus we see that consciousness (mental process) and real being are 
anything but coordinate kinds of being, which dwell peaceably side 
by side and occasionally become “related to” or “connected with” 
one another. Only things which are essentially akin, the respective 
proper essences of which have a like sense, can become connected in <93) 
the true sense of the word, can make up a whole. An immanental or 
absolute being and a transcendent being are, of course, both called 
“existent,” an “object,” and have, more particularly, their objective 
determining contents. But it is evident that what is called “an object” 
and “an objective determination” in the one case, and what is called 
by the same name in the other case, are called so only with reference 
to the empty logical categories. In so far as their respective senses are 
concerned, a veritable abyss yawns between consciousness and reali­
ty. Here, an adumbrated being, not capable of ever becoming given 
absolutely,25 merely accidental and relative;26 there, a necessary 
and absolute being, essentially incapable of becoming given by 
virtue of adumbration and apprearance.27

Thus it becomes clear that, in spite of all our assuredly well- 
founded statements about the real being of the human Ego and its 
conscious mental processes, in the world and about everything in the 
way of “psychophysical” interconnections pertaining to them — 
that, in spite of all that, consciousness considered in its “purity” must 
be held to be a self-contained complex of being, a complex of absolute being 
into which nothing can penetrate and out of which nothing can slip, 
to which nothing is spatiotemporally external and which cannot be 
within any spatiotemporally complex, which cannot be affected by 
any physical thing28 and cannot exercise causation upon any phys­
ical thing — it being presupposed that causality has the normal sense 
of causality pertaining to Nature as a relationship of dependence 
between realities.
On the other hand, the whole spatiotemporal world, which includes 
human being and the human Ego as subordinate single realities is, 
according to its sense, a merely intentional being, thus one has the merely 
secondary sense of a being for a consciousness.29 It is a being posited 
by consciousness in its experiences which, of essential necessity, can 
be determined and intuited only as something identical belonging 
to30 motivated multiplicities of appearences: beyond that it is nothing.31
§50. The Phenomenological Attitude; Pure Consciousness as the Field of 
Phenomenology.
Thus the sense commonly expressed in speaking of being is reversed. 
The being which is first for us is second in itself; i.e., it is what it is, only 
in “relation” to the first. <But it is> not as though there were a blind 
regularity such that the ordo et connexio rerum necessarily con-

leads back to multiplicities of a possible experience presentive of it-itself, experiences ofit in the 
modes of the itself-here, the itself-having-been, the itself-coming — a being which, of essential 
necessity, can be determined and intuited only as something identical belonging to motivated

formed to the ordo et connexio idearum.32 Reality, the reality of the 
physical thing taken singly and the reality of the whole world, lacks <94> 
self-sufficiency in virtue of its essence (in our strict sense of the word). 
Reality is not in itself something absolute which becomes tied sec­
ondarily to something else; rather, in the absolute sense, it is nothing 
at all; it has no “absolute essence” whatever; it has the essentiality of 
something which, of necessity, is only intentional, only an object of 
consciousness, something presented [Vorstelliges] in the manner 
peculiar to consciousness, something apparent <as apparent).33
We now turn our thoughts back again to the first chapter, to our 
observations concerning the phenomenological reduction. It now 
becomes clear that, in contrast to the natural34 theoretical attitude, 
the correlate of which is the world, a new attitude must in fact be 
possible which, in spite of the “exclusion” of this psychophysical 
universe of Nature, leaves us something: the whole field of absolute 
consciousness. Instead, then, of living naively in experience and 
theoretically exploring what is experienced, transcendent Nature, 
we effect the “phenomenological reduction.” In other words, instead 
of naively effecting the acts pertaining to our Nature — constituting 
consciousness35 with their positings of something transcendent, and 
letting ourselves be induced, by motives implicit in them, to effect 
ever new positings of something transcendent — instead of that, we 
put all those positings36 “out of action,” we do not “participate in 
them;” we direct our seizing and theoretically inquiring regard to 
pure consciousness in its own absolute being. That, then, is what is left as the 
sought-for “phenomenological residuum ” though we have “excluded”37 
the whole world with all physical things, living beings, and humans, 
ourselves included. Strictly speaking, we have not lost anything but 
rather have gained the whole of absolute being which, rightly under­
stood, contains within itself, “constitutes” within itself, all worldly 
transcendencies.38
*zMarginal note to this sentence in Copy D: As the motivated actuality and potentiality in the

continuable acts of habitual acceptance

Let us make this clear to ourselves in detail. In the natural attitude 
we simply effect all the acts by virtue of which the world is there for us. 
We live naively in perceiving and experiencing, in these39 acts of 
positing in which unities40 of physical things appear and not only 
appear but also are given with the characteristic of things “on hand,” 
“actual.” When engaged in natural science we effect experientially 
and logically ordered acts of thinking in which these actualities, 
being accepted as they are given, become conceptually determined 
and in which likewise, on the basis of such directly experienced and 
determined transcendencies, new transcendencies are inferred. In 
the phenomenological attitude in essential universality wz prevent the 
effecting of all such cogitative positings, i.e., we “ parenthesize” the 
positings effected; for our new inquiries we do not “participate in 
<95) these positings.” Instead of living in them, instead of effecting them, 
we effect acts of reflection directed to them; and we seize upon them 
themselves as the absolute being which they are.41 We are now living 
completely in such acts of the second degree, acts the datum of which 
is the infinite field of absolute mental processes — the fundamental 
field of phenomenology.
§51. The Signification of the Transcendental Preliminary Considerations.
O f course reflection can be effected by anyone and anyone can bring 
consciousness42 within the sphere of his seizing regard; but that is not 
necessarily to effect a phenomenological reflection, nor is the conscious­
ness seized upon necessarily pure consciousness. Radical considera­
tions, such as we have carried out,43 are necessary in order to44 
penetrate to the cognition that there is any such thing as the field of45 
pure consciousness, indeed, that there is such a thing which is not a

component part of Nature,46 and is so far from being that, that 
Nature is possible only as an intentional unity motivated in tran- 
scendentally pure consciousness by immanental connections. Such 
considerations are necessary in order to know, moreover, that such a 
unity is given to us, and theoretically explorable by us, only in an 
attitude other than the one in which the consciousness “constituting” 
that unity, and likewise any absolute consciousness whatever, is 
explorable.47They are necessary in order that, in the face of our 
philosophical poverty in which, under the fine name of a “world view 
founded on natural science,” we are vainly fatiguing ourselves, it 
may at last become clear that a transcendental investigation of 
consciousness cannot signify an investigation of Nature48 and cannot 
presuppose the latter as a premise because Nature49 is as a m atter of 
essential necessity parenthesized in the transcendental attitude.
They are necessary in order to recognize that our disregarding of the 
whole world in the form of the phenomenological reduction is 
something totally different from a mere abstracting from compo­
nents within more comprehensive interconnections, be they neces­
sary or factual. If mental processes of consciousness were incon­
ceivable without involvement with Nature in the same fashion in which 
colors are inconceivable without extension, then we could not regard 
consciousness as an absolutely peculiar region by itself in the sense in 
which we must so regard it. One must see, however, that by such an 
“abstracting” from Nature50 only something natural can be ac­
quired, and not transcendentally pure consciousness. And, again, 
phenomenological reduction does not mean a mere restriction of 
judgment to a connective part of actual being as a whole.51 In any 
particular science of actuality the theoretical interest is restricted to a 
particular province within the whole of actuality; the others remain <96) 
disregarded in so far as the real relations which run back and forth 
between provinces do not compel a mediative inquiry. In this sense 
mechanics “abstracts” from optical events, from physics taken as a

Still, as every natural scientist knows, that does not mean that any 
province of reality is isolated; the whole world is ultimately a 
single53“Nature,” and all the natural sciences are members of the one 
natural science.54 The situation is fundamentally and essentially 
different in the case of the domain made up of mental processes as 
absolute essentialities.55 It is a strictly self-contained domain, yet 
without any boundaries separating it from other regions. For any­
thing which could limit it would have to share a community of 
essence with it. It is, however, the All of absolute being in the definite 
sense brought out by our analyses. In its essence it is independent of all 
worldly, all natural, being; nor does it need any worldly being for its 
existence. The existence of a Nature cannot be the condition for the 
existence of consciousness, since Nature itself turns out to be a 
correlate of consciousness: Nature is only as being constituted in 
regular concatenations of consciousness.56
Note
In passing let us note the following in order to prevent misunder­
standings: If the factuality in the given organization of the course of 
consciousness with its separate individual streams, and the teleology 
immanent in that factuality were grounds for seeking the basis for 
precisely that organization, then for essentially necessary reasons the 
theological principle which might perhaps be rationally supposed could 
not be assumed as something transcendent in the sense in which the world is 
something transcendent; for, as is already evident in advance from our 
findings, that would involve a countersensical circularity. The order­
ing principle of the absolute must be found in the absolute itself, 
considered purely as absolute. In other words, since a worldly God is 
evidently impossible and since, on the other hand, the immanence of

God in absolute consciousness cannot be taken as immanence in the 
sense of being as a mental process (which would be no less counter- 
sensical), there must be, therefore, within the absolute stream of 
consciousness and its infinities, modes in which transcendencies are 
made known other than the constituting of physical realities as 
unities of harmonious appearances; and ultimately there would also 
have to be intuitional manifestations to which a theoretical thinking 
might conform, so that, by following them rationally, it might make <97> 
intelligible the unitary rule of the supposed theological principle. It is 
likewise evident, then, that this rule must not be taken to be “causal” 
in the sense determined by the concept of causality as obtaining in 
Nature,57 a concept attuned to realities and the functional interde­
pendencies proper to their particular essence.
But none of that concerns us here any further. O ur immediate aim 
is not theology but phenomenology, however mediately important 
the latter may be for the former. To phenomenology, however, the 
fundamental considerations, since they were indispensable,58 served 
to open up the absolute sphere as the field of research peculiar to 
phenomenology.

60 Thefollowing passage inserted in Copy D (published by Schuhmann as Appendix 46, dated Fall, 1929):
With reference to the material world which is, however, only the core-stratum of the world 
itself, the world of realities. This world, which is the surrounding world common to us all, is, 
more particularly with respect to each single real being belonging to it, also material but, in 
general, not merely that: not <in the case of> man and beast who indeed <include> materially 
corporeal organisms but <are> not mere organisms as corporeally real worldly occurences, <nor 
in the case of> language, art, state, etc. Although they, as belonging to the real world as far as 
each of their single real constitutents is concerned, have their physical strata, they also have a 
“spiritual” stratum. Yet even if we were emphasizing only the specifically natural, our 
consideration seems insufficient. We take the Object belonging to Nature, the material 
physical thing, only as the Object of mere sensuous imagination (sensuous experience).
[Glosses by Schuhmann.]

the physical thing as determined by physics, for which the sensuously 
appearing (the perceptually given) physical thing is said to function 
as a “mere appearance,” perhaps even as something “merely sub­
jective.” Nevertheless it is already implicit in the sense of our earlier 
statements that this mere subjectivity ought not to be confused (as it 
is so frequently) with a subjectivity such as characterizes mental 
processes, as though the perceived physical things, with respect to 
their perceptual qualities, and as though these qualities themselves 
were mental processes. Not can it be the true opinion of scientific 
investigators of Nature (particularly if we keep, not to their pro­
nouncements, but to the sense of their method) that the appearing 
physical thing is an illusion or a faulty picture of the “true” physical 
thing as determined by physics. Likewise the statement that the 
determinations of the appearance are signs of the true determinations 
is misleading.61
Are we then allowed to say, in accordance with the “realism” which 
is very widely accepted: The actually perceived (and, in the primary 
sense, appearing) should, for its part, be regarded as an appearance 
of, or an instinctive basis for, inferring something else, intrinsically 
foreign to it and62 separated from it? May we say that, theoretically 
considered, this something else should be accepted as a reality, 
<98) completely unknown by acquaintance, which must be assumed 
hypothetically in order to explain the course of mental appearance- 
processes, <accepted> as a hidden cause of these appearances charac- 
terizable only indirectly and analogically by mathematical 
concepts?
Already, on the basis of our general presentations (which will be 
greatly deepened and undergo continual confirmation by our further 
analyses), it becomes evident that such theories are possible only as 
long as one avoids seriously fixing one’s eyes on, and scientifically 
exploring, the sense of a physical thing-datum and, therefore, of “any 
physical thing whatever,” a sense implicit in experience’s own essence
— the sense which functions as the absolute norm for all rational 
discourse about physical things. If anything runs counter to that 
sense it is countersensical in the strictest signification of the word;63

and that, without doubt, is true of all epistemological theories of the 
type indicated.
It could easily be shown that if the supposed unknown cause existed 
at all, it would have to be essentially perceivable and experienceable if 
not by us then by other Egos who see better and further. W hat is in 
question here is not, perchance, an empty, merely logical possibility 
but rather an essential possibility which is rich in content and valid 
with that content. Furthermore, it could be shown that the possible 
perception itself64 would, as a m atter of essential necessity, have to be 
another case of perception by means of appearances and that, con­
sequently, we should fall into an inevitable infinite regress. It could 
be pointed out, moreover, that an explanation of perceptually given 
processes by hypothetically assumed causative realities, by unknown 
physical affairs (for example, the explanation of certain planetary 
disturbances by the assumption of an as-yet-unknown planet, 
Neptune) is something essentially different from an explanation in 
the sense of a determining of experienced physical things in the 
manner peculiar to physics — an explanation by such physical- 
scientific means as atoms, ions, and the like. In this manner a great 
many points having a similar sense might be developed.
Here we need not enter into a systematically exhaustive discussion 
of all such matters. It is sufficient for our purposes to bring out 
distinctly a few main points.
We begin with the easily verified statement that the perceived 
physical thing itself is always and necessarily precisely the thing which the 
physicist explores and scientifically determines following the method of physics.
This proposition seems to contradict the propositions stated ear­
lier65 in which we sought to determine more precisely the sense of 
certain locutions commonly used by physicists and the sense of the 
traditional distinction between primary and secondary qualities. 
After eliminating obvious misinterpretations we said that the 
“experienced physical thing proper” gives us the “mere This,” an 
“empty X ” which becomes the bearer of the exact determinations 
ascribed in physics which do not themselves fall within experience 
proper. The being which is “ true according to physics” would 
therefore “of essential necessity be determined quite differently”
occasionally fallen into countersense; and, if it is our scientific duty to say so, that will not impair 
our respect for them.

<ioo>
from the being which is given “in person” in perception itself The 
latter is present with purely sensuous determinations which are 
precisely not those ascribed in physics.
Nevertheless, the two presentations are quite compatible and we 
need not quarrel seriously with that interpretation of the conception 
involved in physics. We need only understand it correctly. By no 
means ought we to fall into either the picture-theory or the sign- 
theory, the fundamentally wrong theories which we considered ear­
lier without particular regard to the physical thing as determined in 
physics and which we likewise refuted in a radically universal 
manner.66 A picture or a sign refers to something lying outside it 
which would “itself5 be seized upon were we to go over into a 
different mode of objectivation, into that of presentive intuition. In 
themselves, a sign or a picture do not “make known” the designated 
(or depictured) affair itself.67 The physical thing as determined by 
physics, however, is nothing foreign to what appears sensuously “in 
person;” rather it is something which makes itself known originaliter 
in it and, more particularly, a priori (for indefeasible eidetic reasons) 
only in it. Accordingly, even the sensuous determination-content of 
the X  which functions as bearer of the determinations ascribed in 
physics is no clothing foreign to these determinations and hiding 
them: rather, only because the X  is the subject of the sensuous deter­
minations is it the subject also of the determinations ascribed in 
physics which, for their part, make themselves known in68 the sensuous 
determinations. According to what has been set forth in detail, it is 
necessary that a physical thing, and precisely the physical thing of 
which the physicist speaks, can be given only sensuously in sensuous 
“modes of appearance;” and the identical appearing in the changing 
continuity of these modes of appearance is what the physicist subjects 
to a causal analysis69 in its relationship to all experienceable (thus 
perceived or perceivable) concatenations which can be considered as 
“circumstances,” an exploration with respect to its necessary real 
connections with them. The physical thing which he observes, with 
which he experiments, which he continually sees, takes in his hand, 
puts on the scale or in the melting furnace: that physical thing, and 
no other, becomes the subject of the predicates ascribed in physics,

such as weight, temperature, electrical resistance, and so forth. 
Likewise, it is the perceived processes and concatenations themselves 
which become determined by means of concepts such as force, 
acceleration, energy, atom, ion, etc. The sensuously appearing thing, 
which has the sensuous shapes, colors, odor- and taste-properties, is 
thus anything but a sign for some other thing; rather it is, so to speak, a 
sign for itself.

such and such sensuous determinations under the given phenomenal 
circumstances is, for the physicist, who has already carried out in a universal 
manner for all such physical things, in phenomenal concatenations of 
the sort in question, their determination by means of concepts peculiar to 
physics, an indicative sign of a wealth of causal properties belonging to 
this same physical thing which, as causal properties, make them­
selves known in phenomenal dependencies of familiar sorts. W hat 
makes itself known here — by being made known in intentional 
unities pertaining to mental processes of consciousness — is obviously 
something essentially transcendent.
According to all this it is clear that even the higher transcendency 
characterizing the physical thing as determined by physics does not signify 
reaching out beyond the world which is for consciousness, or for every Ego 
functioning as a cognizing subject (singly or in an empathic context).
Indicated in a universal way, the situation is this, that the thinking 
pertaining to physics establishes itself on the foundation laid by 
natural experiencing (or by natural positings which it effects). Fol­
lowing the rational motives presented to it by the concatenations of 
experience, it is compelled to effect certain modes of conception, 
certain intentional constructions required by reason, and to effect 
them for the theoretical determination of sensuously experienced things. 
Precisely because of this there arises the contrast between the physical 
thing as object of the sensuous imaginatio simpliciter and the phys­
ical thing as object of the physicist’s intellectio; and, for the latter 
side, all the ideally inherent ontological formations produced by 
thinking accrue which become expressed in the concepts peculiar to <101) 
physics and which draw, and should draw, their sense exclusively 
from the method of natural science.
If experiential-logical reason, under the name of physics, fashions 
in this manner an intentional correlate belonging to a higher level —
70Insertion in Copy A at beginning of paragraph.: What that signifies can easily be made clear.

if it fashions the Nature determined by physics out of simply appear­
ing Nature — then we rightly call it mythologizing when this in­
tellectually seen datum  of reason, which indeed is nothing more than 
the experiential-logical determination of the Nature given in intuition 
simpliciter, is made out to be an unknown world of physical realities 
which is hypothetically substructed for purposes of explaining the 
appearances causally.11
In a countersensical manner one thus connects by causality things 
pertaining to the senses and physical things as determined by physics. 
As a consequence, in the usual realism, however, one confuses the 
sensuous appearances by virtue of their “ mere subjectivity,” i.e., the 
appearing objects, as appearing (which are themselves already some­
thing transcendent), with the absolute mental processes of any ap­
pearing, of any experiencing consciousness whatever, which is con­
stituting them. Everywhere this confusion is perpetrated in at least 
this form: one speaks as though Objective physics were engaged not in 
explaining the “physical thing-appearances” in the sense of the 
physical things appearing, but in the sense of the constituting mental 
processes of experiencing consciousness.72 Causality, which belongs 
essentially to the context of the constituted intentional world and has 
sense only within that world, is now made not merely into a mythical 
bond between the “Objective” being which physics determines and 
the “subjective” being which appears in immediate experience — 
the “merely subjective” thing pertaining to the senses with the “sec­
ondary qualities” — ; rather, by the illegitimate shifting from the 
latter to the consciousness constituting it, causality is made into a 
bond between the being which physics determines and absolute 
consciousness and, specifically, the pure mental processes of 
experiencing. In so doing, one attributes a mythical absolute reality 
to the being determined by physics, while completely failing to see 
what is truly absolute: pure consciousness as pure consciousness in its 
purity. Accordingly, no note is taken of the absurdity involved in 
absolutizing Nature as conceived by physics, in absolutizing this 
intentional correlate of logically determinative thinking; and like­
wise no note is taken of the absurdity in making this Nature, which

determines the directly intuited physical world in terms of experien­
tial logic and which, in this function, is fully known (so that to look for 
something behind it makes no sense) into an unknown and only < 102) 
secretely indicated reality which itself can never be apprehended 
with respect to any determination ofits own, and to which one now 
imputes the role of a causative reality in relation to the courses of 
subjective appearances and experiencing mental processes.
A not insignificant influence is exercised in these misinterpreta­
tions by the circumstance that one misinterprets the lack of sensuous 
intuitability which is a property of all categorial unities produced by 
thinking (and is particularly striking, naturally, in the case of those 
formed at a highly mediated level) as well as the useful inclination in 
the practice of cognition to attach sensuous images, “models,” to 
these unities: that which is not intuitable sensuously is understood to 
be a symbolic representative of something hidden, which could become 
an object of simple sensuous intuition if there were a better intellec­
tual organization; and the models are understood to serve as intuited 
schematic pictures in place of this hidden reality having, accord­
ingly, a function similar to that belonging to the hypothetical draw­
ings of extinct living beings73 which the paleontologist makes on the 
basis of meagre Data. One does not pay attention to the evident sense 
of the constructional unities produced by thinking, as constructional; 
and one overlooks the fact that here the hypothetical is restricted to 
the sphere of cogitative synthesis. Not even a Divine physics74 can 
make simply intuited determinations out of those categorial deter­
minations of realities which are produced by thinking, any more 
than a Divine omnipotence can bring it to pass that someone paints 
elliptic functions or plays them on the violin.
However greatly this exposition needs deepening, however sen­
sible to us because of the need for a full clarification of all relevant 
matters may be, what we require for our purposes has become 
evident to us: that of essential necessity the transcendency belonging 
to the physical thing as determined by physics is the transcendency 
belonging to a being which becomes constituted in, and tied to, 
consciousness, and that the taking into consideration of m athem at­
ical natural science (no m atter how many particular enigmas may be 
involved in its cognition) in no way alters our results.

It requires no special explanation75 to see that everything we have 
made clear to ourselves with respect to Objectivities belonging to 
Nature, as “mere things,” must hold in the case of all axiological, and 
<all> practical Objectivities which are founded on them:76 all aesthe­
tic objects, all cultural formations, etc. And, likewise, in the case of all 
transcendencies of whatever sort which become constituted in the 
manner peculiar to consciousness.77
<103) §53. Animalia and Psychological Consciousness.
Great importance is attached to another extension of the limits 
within which we have confined our observations. We have included 
within the sphere of our findings the whole of material Nature, 
appearing sensuously, and the nature founded in the latter and 
determined by physics at a higher level of cognition. But what about 
animate realities, humans and beasts? W hat about their psyches and 
psychical mental processes? The complete world is not merely physical; it 
is also psychophysical.78 It must — who can deny it? — include all 
the streams of consciousness connected with animated organisms. 
Thus, on the one hand consciousness is said to be the absolute in which 
everything transcendent and, therefore, ultimately the whole psy­
chophysical world, becomes constituted; and, on the other hand, con­
sciousness is said to be a subordinate real event within that world. How can 
these statements be reconciled?
Let us make clear to ourselves how consciousness, so to speak, can 
enter into the real world, how that which in itself is absolute can 
relinguish its immanence and take on the characteristic of tran­
scendence.79 We immediately see that it can do so only by a certain

participation in transcendence in the first, the originary sense; and 
this is obviously the transcendence belonging to Nature. Only by 
virtue ofits experienced relation to the organism does consciousness 
become real hum an or brute consciousness, and only thereby does it 
acquire a place in the space belonging to Nature and the time 
belonging to Nature — the time which is physically measured. We 
also recall that only by virtue of the80 connection joining a conscious­
ness and an81 organism to make up an empirically intuited unity 
within Nature82 is any such thing as mutual understanding between 
animate beings pertaining to a world possible; and that only thereby 
can any cognizing subject83 find the complete world and at the same 
time know it as one and the same surrounding world belonging in 
common to him and to all other subjects.
A peculiar kind of apprehending or experiencing, a peculiar kind of 
“apperception,” effects the production of this so-called “annexation,” 
this reification \Realisierung] of consciousness. Regardless of that 
whereof this apperception consists, or of what particular kind of 
demonstration it may demand, this much is obvious: Consciousness 
itself, in these apperceptive involvements or in this psychophysical 
relationship to something corporeal, loses none ofits own essence and 
can take up into itself nothing alien to its essence; indeed, that would < 104) 
be a countersense.84 Corporeal being is essentially a being which 
appears, which becomes presented by virtue of sensuous adumbration. 
Consciousness apperceived as part of Nature [naturhaft apperzierte 
Bewufitsein], the stream of consciousness given as a stream of human 
or brute consciousness, naturally does not become, by means of that 
apperception, something which appears by virtue of adumbration.
And still it has become something other, a component part of 
Nature. In itself, it is what it is by its absolute essence. But it is not 
seized upon in this flowing thisness; it is instead “apprehended as 
something;”85 and in this specifically peculiar apprehending a tran-

scendence of a peculiar kind becomes constituted: there now appears a 
sequence of conscious states of an identical real Ego-subject86 which 
manifests in them its individual real properties and who now — as this 
unity of properties becoming manifest in states — is intended to as 
united with the appearing organism. Thus, as something which appears, 
the psychophysical unity in Nature, a human or a beast, becomes 
constituted as a somatically founded unity corresponding to the found­
ing involved in apperception.87
As in the case of any other transcending apperception, so here two 
attitudes are essentially effected. With one our seizing regard is di­
rected to the apperceived object, as it were, through the transcending 
apprehension; in the other it is directed reflectively to88 the pure 
apprehending consciousness. In our case we have, accordingly, on 
the one hand, the psychological attitude in which our naturally focused 
regard is directed to mental processes — e.g to a mental process of 
rejoicing — as a sequence of mental states of hum an or beast. O n the 
other hand, we have the phenomenological attitude combined with the 
latter89 as an essential possibility which, reflecting and excluding the 
positings of something transcendent, is a turning toward absolute, 
pure consciousness and finds, as an absolute mental process, the 
apperception of a sequence of states: thus, in the example above, the 
affective mental process of rejoicing as an absolute phenomenolog­
ical datum, but in the medium of an apprehensional function which 
animates it — precisely the function of “manifesting” a sequence of 
states connected with the appearing organism and belonging to a 
human Ego-subject. The “ pure” mental process90 “ lies,” in a certain 
sense, within what is psychologically apperceived, in the mental 
process as a human state; in its own essence it takes on the form of a 
sequence of states and with that form its intentional relationship to 
<105) the human Ego and the human organism.91 If the mental process in 
question — in our example, the feeling of rejoicing — loses that 
intentional form (and it is, after all, conceivable), it does indeed 
undergo an alteration, but only in that it is thereby simplified so that

§54. Continuation. The Transcendent Psychological Mental Process Acci­
dental and Relative; the Transcendental Mental Process Necessary and 
Absolute.
Let us imagine that we effect natural apperceptions, but that our 
apperceptions are always invalid93 since they allow for no harmoni­
ous concatenations in which experienced unities might become con­
stituted. In other words, let us imagine that, in the manner described 
above,94 the whole of Nature, in the first place, physical nature, is 
“annihilated.” Then there would be no more animate organisms and 
therefore no more human beings. I should no longer exist as a human 
being: and, a fortiori, no fellow hum an beings would exist for me. But 
my consciousness, greatly as the mental processes comprised in it 
would be altered, would remain a stream of absolute mental pro­
cesses with its own essence. If anything were still left which allowed 
my mental processes to be apprehended as “states” of a personal95 
Ego, states in the changes of which identical personal96 psychical 
properties became manifest, we could dissolve those apprehendings, 
do away with the intentional forms which they constitute, and 
reduce <my mental processes> to pure mental processes.97 Psychical 
states also point back to regularities of absolute mental processes in 
which they become constituted, in which they take on the inten­
tional, and in its fashion, transcendent form “state.”
Certainly a consciousness without an animated organism and, 
paradoxical as it sounds, also without a psyche, a consciousness 
which is not personal,98 is imaginable. That is to say, a stream of 
consciousness in which the intentional unities of experience, organ-

ism, psyche, and empirical Ego-subject did not become constituted, 
in which all of these experiential concepts, and therefore the concept 
of a mental process in the psychological sense (as a mental process of a "  
person, an animate Ego), were without any basis and, in any case, 
without any validity. All empirical unities, and therefore also psycho­
logical mental processes, are indices pointing to concatenations of absolute 
mental processes™ having a distinctive essential formation, along with 
which other formations are imaginable; all101 are, in the same sense, 
transcendent, merely relative, accidental. One must convince oneself 
<106) that the obviousness with which every mental process in one’s own 
life or in another’s is accepted, and quite legitimately, as a psycholog­
ical and psychophysical sequence of states of an animate subject, has 
its limit in the aforementioned consideration: that in contrast to the 
empirical102 mental process there stands, as a presupposition for the sense 
of that process, the absolute mental process; that the latter is not a 
metaphysical construction but rather something which, in its ab­
soluteness, can become indubitably demonstrated, given in direct 
intuition by a corresponding change in one’s attitude. One must 
convince onself that anything psychical, in the sense relevant to psychology, 
psychical personality, psychical properties, mental processes or 
states, are103 empirical unities and are therefore, like other realities of 
every kind and level, merely unities of intentional “constitution” — 
in its sense, truly existing: intuitable, experienceable, scientifically 
determinable on the basis of experience, but still “merely inten­
tional” and hence merely “relative.” To take them as existing in the 
absolute sense is consequently a countersense.
§55. Conclusion. All Reality Existent By Virtue of “Sense-bestowal.” Not a 
“Subjective Idealism

some metaphysical postulates or other, but because we can show it by

consciousness which, for its part, exists absolutely and not by virtue of 
another sense-bestowal. If one derives the concept of reality from 
natural realities, from unities of possible experience, then “all the 
world” or “all of Nature” is, of course, equivalent to the all of 
realities; but to identify the latter with the all of being, and thus to 
absolutize it itself is a countersense. An absolute reality is just as valid as a 
round square. Reality and world are names here precisely for certain 
valid unities of sense, unities of “sense” related to certain concatena­
tions of absolute, of pure consciousness which, by virtue of their 
essence, bestow sense and demonstrate sense-validity precisely thus 
and not otherwise.
If anyone reading our statements objects that they mean changing 
all the world into a subjective illusion and committing oneself to a 
“Berkeleyan idealism,” we can only answer that he has not seized <107) 
upon the sense of those statements. They take nothing away from the 
fully valid being of the world as the all of realities, just as nothing is 
taken away from the fully valid geometrical being of the square by 
denying that the square is round (a denial admittedly based, in this 
case, on what is immediately obvious). The real actuality is not 
“reinterpreted,” to say nothing ofits being denied; it is rather that a 
countersensical interpretation of the real actuality, i.e., an interpre­
tation which contradicts the latter’s own sense as clarified by insight, 
is removed. That interpretation stems from a philosophical absolutiz­
ing of the world completely alien to the natural way of considering 
the world. This is, precisely, natural; it lives naively in the effecting of 
the general positing described by us; thus it can never become a 
countersense. The countersense only arises when one philosophizes 
and, while seeking ultimate intelligence about the sense of the world, 
never even notices that the world itself has its whole being as a certain 
“sense” which presupposes absolute consciousness as the field where 
sense is bestowed;105 and when, at the same time, one fails to notice 
that this field, this sphere of being of absolute origins,106 is accessible to

§56. The Question About the Range ofthe Phenomenological Reduction. Natural 
and Cultural Sciences.
The exclusion1 of Nature was for us the methodic means for initially 
making possible the turning of regard to transcendentally pure 
consciousness. Now that we have brought it into the purvue of seeing 
regard, it is still useful to consider, conversely, what must remain 
excluded for the purpose of an investigation of pure consciousness and 
whether the necessary exclusion2 concerns only the sphere of Nature. 
From the standpoint of the phenomenological science which we 
propose to establish, that signifies <considering> in addition which 
sciences it might draw from without violating its pure sense, which 
<sciences> it might and might not use as given beforehand, which, hence, 
need “parenthesizing.” Because ofits peculiar essence as a science of 
“origins,” methodological questions of that sort, which are far re­
moved from any naive (“dogmatic” ) science, must be considered 
carefully by phenomenology.
In the first place, it is immediately understandable that, with the 
exclusion of the natural world, the physical and psychophysical3 
world, all individual objectivities which become constituted by axi- 
ological and practical functionings of consciousness are excluded,4 all 
the sorts of cultural formations, all works of the technical and fine arts, 
of sciences (in so far as they come into question as cultural facts rather 
than as accepted unities), aesthetic and practical values of every form. 
Likewise, naturally, such actualities as state, custom, law, religion. 
Consequently, all natural sciences and cultural sciences, with their total

stock of cognition, undergo exclusion5 precisely as sciences which re­
quire the natural attitude.
< 109) §57. The Question of the Exclusion of the Pure Ego [Ich ].
Difficulties arise at one limit. Hum an being as natural being and as 
person in personal association, in that of “society,” is excluded; 
likewise every other animate being. But what about the pure Ego? Has 
the phenomenological Ego which we also find become a transcenden­
tal nothing because of the phenomenological reduction? Let us reduce 
to the stream of pure consciousness. In reflection every cogitatio 
effected takes on the explicit form, cogito. Does it lose this form if we 
exercise the transcendental reduction?
This much is clear from the very beginning: After carrying out this 
reduction we shall not encounter the pure Ego anywhere in the flux of 
manifold mental process which remains as a transcendental residuum
— neither as one mental process among others, nor as strictly a part of a 
mental process, arising and then disappearing with the mental process 
of which it is a part. The Ego seems to be there continually, indeed, 
necessarily, and this continualness is obviously not that of a stupidly 
persistent mental process, a “fixed idea.” Instead, the Ego belongs to 
each coming and going mental process; its “regard” is directed 
“through” each actional cogito to the objective something. This ray of 
regard changes from one cogito to the next, shooting forth anew with 
each newcogito and vanishing with it. The Ego, however, is something 
identical. At least, considered eidetically, any cogito can change, come 
and go, even though one may doubt that every cogito is necessarily 
something transitory6 and not simply, as we find it, something in fact 
transitory. In contradistinction, the pure Ego would, however, seem to 
be something essentially necessary; and, as something absolutely ident­
ical throughout every actual or possible change in mental processes, it 
cannot in any sense be a really inherent part or moment of the mental processes 
themselves.
In every actional cogito the ego lives out its life in a special sense. But 
all mental processes in the background likewise belong to it; and it

belongs to them. All of them, as belonging to the one stream of mental 
processes which is mine, must admit of becoming converted into 
actional cogitationes or incorporated into actional cogitationes as 
immanental constituents. In K ant’s words,7 “The V think’ must be 
capable of accompanying all my presentations
If® we retain a pure Ego as a residuum after our phenomenological 
exclusion of the world and of the empirical subjectivity included in it 
(and an essentially different pure Ego for each stream of mental <110) 
processes), then there is presented in the case of that Ego a transcen­
dency of a peculiar kind — one which9is not constituted — a transcen­
dency within immanency. Because of the immediately essential role played 
by this transcendency in the case of any cogitation, we must not 
undertake its exclusion; though in many investigations the questions 
concerning the pure Ego can remain in suspenso. But only in so far as its 
immediate, evidently ascertainable essential peculiarity and its given­
ness along with pure consciousness extend do we propose to count the 
pure Ego as a phenomenological datum; all theories about it which 
exceed those limits undergo exclusion. I n the Second Book of this essay 
we shall find occasion, moreover, to devote a separate chapter to the 
difficult questions concerning the pure Ego; in that context we shall 
also make secure the position taken here in a preliminary way.10
f 58. The Transcendency, God, Excluded.
After the natural world is abandoned, we encounter yet another 
transcendency which is not given, like the pure Ego, immediately in 
union with reduced consciousness but becomes cognized in a highly 
mediated fashion,11 a transcendency standing, as it were, in polar 
contrast to the transcendency pertaining to the world. We mean the

world concerning which there can be classifying and describing 
sciences. At the same time precisely this world, with respect to the 
material lower level, admits of becoming determined in the theoretical 
thinking of the mathematical natural sciences as the “appearance” of a 
Nature as determined by physics, subject to laws of Nature which are exact. 
In all this, since the rationality made actual by the fact is not a rationality 
demanded by the essence, there is a marvelous teleology.
<111) 
Furthermore: The systematic exploration of all teleologies to be 
found in the empirical world itself, for example thefactual evolution of 
the sequence of organisms as far as human being and, in the develop­
ment of mankind, the growth of culture with its spiritual treasures, is 
not yet completed with the natural-scientific explanation of all such 
produced formations as coming from the given factual circumstances 
and according to the laws of Nature. Rather, the transition to pure 
consciousness by the method of transcendental reduction leads neces­
sarily to the question about the ground for the now-emerging factual­
ness of the corresponding constitutive consciousness. Not the fact as 
such, but the fact as source of endlessly increasing value-possibilities 
and value-actualities forces the question into one about the “ground”
— which naturally does not have the sense ofa physical-causal reason. 
We pass over whatever else, from the point of view of religious 
consciousness, is able, as a rationally grounding motive, to lead to the 
same principle. W hat concerns us here, after merely indicating 
different groups of such rational grounds lor < believing in> the exist ence 
of an extra-worldly “divine” being is that this being would obviously 
transcend not merely the world but “absolute” consciousness. It 
would therefore be an “absolute” in the sense totally different from that in 
which consciousness is an absolute, just as it would be something transcendent 
in a sense totally different from that in which the world is something 
transcendent.
Naturally we extend the phenomenological reduction to include 
this “absolute” and “ transcendent” being. It shall remain excluded 
from the new field of research which is to be provided, since this sh all be a 
field of pure consciousness.

§59. The Transcendency of the Eidetic. Exclusion of Pure Logic as Mathesis 
Universalis.12
Having excluded individual realities in every sense of the word, we now 
attempt to exclude all other sorts of “ transcendencies.” This attempt 
concerns the set of “universal” objects, of essences. They are also 
‘1 transcendent” to pure consciousness in a certain manner; they are not 
to be found as really inherent within it. Nevertheless, we cannot go on 
excluding transcendencies without limit; transcendental purification 
cannot mean an exclusion of all transcendencies since otherwise even 
though a pure consciousness would indeed remain, there would not 
remain, however, any possibility of a science of pure consciousness. <112)
Let us make this clear. Let us attempt the maximum possible 
exclusion of the eidetic and consequently a like exclusion of all eidetic 
sciences. To each regionally delimi table sphere of individual being, in 
the broadest logical sense, there belongs an ontology. For example, an 
ontology of Nature belongs to physical nature; an ontology of psycho­
physical being to the psychophysical. All of these disciplines, whether 
already developed or merely required, undergo reduction. In contrast 
to the material ontologies, we find “formal” ontology (united with the 
formal logic of significations produced by thinking), to which the 
quasi-region, “any object whatever,” belongs. If we try to exclude in 
addition <formal ontology>, doubts arise which will, at the same time, 
concern the possibility of an unrestricted exclusion of the eidetic.
The following series of thoughts emerge. To each province of being 
we must attach, for the purposes of science, certain eidetic spheres as 
adjunts, not simply as provinces ofresearch but as places into which the 
investigator of the province in question must be allowed to reach for 
eidetic cognitions whenever the interconnected theoretical motives 
within the essential peculiarity of that province incline him to do so.
Above all, every investigator must surely be able to freely call on formal 
logic (or formal ontology). For no matter what things he may be 
investigating, they are always objects; and whatever is true formaliter 
ofany objects whatever13 (any properties whatever, any predicatively 
formed affair-complexes whatever, and the like) ? that too is his. And no 
m atter how he frames concepts and propositions, draws conclusions, 
etc., what formal logic establishes with formal universality regarding
14 Addition to title of section in Copy A: The Norm of Phenomenology
13 Insertion in Copy A: with respect to all their categorially produced forms

such significations and their genera, concerns him too and, in the same 
manner, any other investigator of the special sciences. Therefore it 
concerns the phenomenologist. Every pure mental process is also 
subsumed under the logically broadest sense of the word, object. It 
appears that we are consequently unable to exclude formal logic or 
formal ontology. And, for obviously similar reasons, we should also be 
unable to exclude universal noetics which enounces eidetic insights 
concerning the rationality or irrationality ofanyjudgmental thinking 
the significational contents of which are determined only in formal 
universality.
But if we consider the situation more closely, we see that, given 
certain presuppositions, there arises a possibility of “parenthesizing” 
formal logic and consequently all the disciplines of formal mathesis 
(algebra, theory of numbers, theory of manifolds, etc.). If we pre­
suppose, namely, that the investigation of pure consciousness by 
phenomenology does not and need not impose any problems other 
<113) than those of a descriptive analysis which can be solved in pure 
intuition, then neither the forms14 of theories of the mathematical 
disciplines nor any derivative theorems of the latter can be of use to 
phenomenology. Where the fashioning of concepts and judgments is 
not a process of constructing them, where no systems of mediate 
deductions are built, the doctrine of forms15 of all deductive systems, as 
found in mathematics, cannot function as an instrument in material 
research.
Now phenomenology is, in fact, a purely descriptive discipline, ex­
ploring the field of transcendentally pure consciousness by pure in- 
tuition. The only propositions of logic to which phenomenology might 
ever have occasion to refer would therefore be mere logical axioms, like 
the law ofcontradiction, axioms the universal and absolute validity of 
which it would be able16 to make evident, however, on the basis of 
examples included among its own data. Therefore we can extend the 
explicitly excluding £7ioxf| to formal logic and to mathesis in its entirety 
and, in so doing, be assured of the legitimacy of the norm which we, as 
phenomenologists intend to follow: To avail ourselves of nothing but what 
we can make essentially evident by observing consciousness itself in its pure 
immanence.17

At the same time we thus acquire the explicit knowledge that a 
descriptive phenomenology is essentially independent of all those 
disciplines. In connection with a utilization of phenomenology for 
philosophical purposes, this finding is not without importance; and it is 
therefore advantageous to take note of it on this occasion.
§60. The Exclusion of Material-Eidetic Disciplines.
As for what now concerns the material-eidetic spheres, one of them is 
marked out for us in such a manner that obviously there can be no 
thought of excluding it: the eidetic sphere pertaining to phenomeno- 
logically purified consciousness itself. Even if our aim were to study 
pure consciousness in its single particularizations, i.e., in the way 
proper to a science of matters of fact, though not as it is studied by 
empirical psychology (since we are operating within the limits im­
posed by our phenomenological exclusion of the world), we could not 
do without the Apriori belonging to consciousness. A science of matters 
offact cannot renounce the right to make use of the eidetic truths which 
relate to individual objectivities belonging to its own province. But, 
according to what has already been said in the Introduction, our aim is <114) 
precisely to found phenomenology itself as an eidetic science, as the 
theory of the essence of transcendentally purified consciousness.
If we do that, phenomenology embraces as its own all “immanental 
essences ” i.e., all those which become singularized exclusively in the 
individual events of a stream of consciousness, in fleeting single mental 
processes of any kind. Now it is of fundamental importance to see that 
not all essences belong to that sphere, that just as in the case of individual 
objectivities the difference between immanental and transcendent ob­
jectivities obtains, so too it obtains in the case of the corresponding 
essences. Thus, for example, the essences “physical thing,5’ “spatial 
shape, “motion,” “color of a physical thing,” and the like, and also the 
essences “human being,” “human sensation,” “psyche,” “psychical 
process” (mental process in the psychological sense), “person” “charac­
ter trait,” and the like, are transcendent. If we intend to develop a 
phenomenology as a purely descriptive eidetic doctrine of the immanental 
consciousness-formationsy the occurrences in the stream of mental pro­
cesses which can be seized upon within the boundaries drawn by 
phenomenological exclusion, then no transcendent individuals and, 
therefore, none of the “transcendent essences” belonging within those

boundaries are included. These have their logical place in the eidetic 
doctrine of the relevant transcendent objectivities.18
Concerned only with the immanental, phenomenology in no way 
posits the being ofsuch essences, makes no statements about their validity 
or nonvalidity, or about the ideal possibility of objectivities correspond­
ing to them, and establishes no eidetic laws relating to them.
Regions and disciplines concerning transcendent essences are es­
sentially incapable of contributing any premises for a phenomenology 
which actually seeks to restrict itself to the region of pure mental 
processes. Since our aim is to ground phenomenology precisely in this 
purity (in conformity with the norm stated a moment ago), and since 
extremely great philosophical interests depend on its being developed 
with full awareness as havingsuch purity, we explicitly broaden the original 
reduction to cover all provinces of transcendent essences and the 
ontologies pertaining to them.
Thus, just as we exclude actual physical Nature and the empirical 
natural sciences, we exclude the eidetic natural sciences, i.e., those 
which investigate19 whatever essentially belongs to objectivity per­
taining to physical nature as physical nature. Geometry, phoronomy, 
<115) and the “pure” physics of matter, are parenthesized. In like manner, 
just as we have excluded all experiential sciences of animate natural 
beings and all empirical cultural sciences ofpersonal beings in personal 
associations, of human beings as the subjects of history, the bearers of 
culture, and also such sciences of cultural formations themselves, etc., 
so now we also exclude the eidetic sciences corresponding to those 
objectivities. We exclude them before the fact and in idea; because up 
to now, as everyone knows, these20 eidetic sciences (e.g., rational 
psychology and rational sociology) have not been founded or else have 
not been founded purely and in a manner free from objection.
With respect to the philosophical functions which phenomenology 
is called upon to assume, it is well to state explicitly that our exposition 
has, at the same time, established the fact \ha.\. phenomenology is absolutely 
independent of the material-eidetic sciences, as well as of all the others.
O ur broadenings of the phenomenological reduction obviously do 
not have the fundamental significance which attaches to our original 
exclusion merely ot the natural world and the sciences relating to it.

This first reduction is, after all, what makes it at all possible in the first 
place to turn one’s regard to the phenomenological field and seize upon 
its data. The other reductions, because they presuppose the first, are 
secondary; but this by no means implies that they have less 
significance.
§61. The Methodological Signification of the Systematic Theory of Phenomen­
ological Reductions.
For the phenomenological method (and consequently for the me­
thod of any transcendental inquiry whatever) a systematic doctrine 
of all the phenomenological reductions which we have tried to 
outline here has a great importance. Their explicitly stated “paren- 
thesizings” have the methodic function of continually reminding us 
that the spheres of being and cognition in question essentially lie 
outside the one which, as the transcendental phenomenological 
sphere, is to be explored, and that any intruding of premises belon­
ging to those parenthesized spheres is an indication of countersensi- 
cal confusion, a genuine (Liexdpaoig. If the province of phenomenology 
were presented with such immediate obviousness as the province 
pertaining to the natural attitude in experiencing, or if it became <116) 
given in consequence of a simple transition from the latter to the 
eidetic attitude as, for example, the province of geometry becomes 
given when one starts from what is empirically spatial, then there 
would be no need of circumstantial reductions with the difficult 
deliberations which they involve. Nor would there be any need for 
care in distinguishing the separate steps were it not for the continuous 
temptations to fallacious Metabasis, particularly in the interpretation 
of the objectivies pertaining to the eidetic disciplines. They are such 
strong temptations that they threaten the person who, in so far as 
some single provinces are concerned, has freed himself from generally 
prevalent misconceptions.
In the first place, there is the extraordinarily wide-spread inclina­
tion of our age to psychologize the eidetic. Its victims include many who 
call themselves idealists; indeed, the effect of all empiricistic concep­
tions on the idealistic camp has been a strong one. Anyone who 
regards ideas, essences, as “psychical structures,” anyone who, in the 
case of those operations of consciousness in which the “concepts” of 
color, shape, etc., are attained on the basis of an exemplificatory

intuition of physical things with their colors, shapes, etc., confuses the 
resulting consciousness of these essences (color, shape) with the 
essences themselves, ascribing to the flux of consciousness as its really 
inherent component part something which necessarily transcends it: 
anyone who does this, on the one hand, corrupts psychology since it 
concerns even empirical consciousness; on the other hand (and this is 
what interests us here) it corrupts phenomenology. It is of very great 
importance, then, that clarity be produced in this respect if the 
region sought is to be actually found. This, however, is done natural­
ly along the way which we have followed: first of all in a universal 
vindication of the eidetic as eidetic, and then in the context of the 
doctrine of the phenomenological reduction as involving a specific 
exclusion of the eidetic.
Now this exclusion, to be sure, had to be restricted to the eidetics of 
transcendent individual objectivities in every sense. Here a new funda­
mental moment is to be considered. Once we have freed ourselves 
from the inclination to psychologize the essence and the relationships 
among essences, it is another great step forward, one which by no 
means follows as a m atter of course, when the highly significant 
distinction which we have designated briefly as the distinction bet­
ween the essence of something immanent and of something transcendent is 
recognized and consistently taken into consideration throughout. 
On the one hand, essences of formations belonging to consciousness 
17) itself; on the other hand, essences of individual affairs transcendent to 
consciousness, thus the essences of those individual affairs which only 
become “manifested” in formations belonging to consciousness, 
which become “constituted” in the manner peculiar to consciousness 
by virtue of sensuous appearances.
At least for me the second step was very difficult, even after the 
first. Today that cannot escape an attentive reader of the Logische 
Untersuchungen. With complete decisiveness the first step was taken 
there by grounding in detail the independent legitimacy of the 
eidetic in oposition to its being psychologized — much against the 
spirit of the times which was reacting so strongly against “Platonism” 
and “logicism.” As for the second step, it was decisively taken in some 
theories, for example, in those concerning logico-categorial objectivi­
ties and the presentive consciousness of them; but in other expositions 
in the same volume the vacillation is obvious, e.g., in that the concept 
of the logical proposition is related sometimes to the logico-categorial 
objectivity and sometimes to the corresponding immanental essence

of the judgmental thinking. The fact is that the beginner in phenome­
nology finds it difficult to acquire a reflective mastery of the different 
focusings of consciousness with their different objective correlates.
That, however, is true with respect to all eidetic spheres which do not 
pertain to the immanency of consciousness itself. One must gain this 
insight not only regarding formal-logical and formal-ontological 
essences and relationships among essences (thus in the case of essences 
such as “proposition” and “syllogism” and, on the other hand, 
“num ber,” “ordered set” and “manifold” ), but also regarding essen­
ces drawn from the sphere of the natural world (like “physical 
thing,” “bodily shape,” “human being,” and “person”). An index to 
this insight is the broadened phenomenological reduction. Ruling us 
as a result is the practical consciousness that, as in the case of the 
sphere of the natural world, none of these eidetic spheres of essential 
necessity must be accepted by the phenomenologist as spheres given 
with respect to their veritable being; that, to ensure the purity of 
one’s region of inquiry, his judgments may refer to them only as 
parenthesized spheres; and that, from all the sciences pertaining to 
them, not a single theorem, indeed not even an axiom, can be taken 
and admitted as a premise for phenomenological purposes — all of 
this now acquires great methodological significance. Precisely by this 
<practical consciousness> we protect ourselves methodically against 
these confusions so deeply rooted in us as born dogmatists; in no other 
way could we avoid them.
§62. Epistemological Anticipations. The “ Dogmatic” and the Phenomeno- <118) 
logical Attitude.
I just used the word “dogmatist.” It will become apparent that this 
was no merely analogical usage and that, on the contrary, the 
epistemological allusion has its source in the proper essence of the 
matters under consideration here. There is good reason for recalling 
here the epistemological antithesis between dogmatism and criticism 
and for calling all the sciences which have undergone reduction 
“d o gm aticFor it can be seen, by virtue of the own peculiar essence of 
the sources, on the one hand, that they and they alone are the sciences 
which require “criticism” — and, indeed, a criticism, which they 
themselves are essentially incapable of effecting; and, on the other 
hand, that the science having the unique function of effecting the

criticism of all others and, at the same time, of itself is none other than 
phenomenology.21 Stated more precisely: It is the distinctive pecu­
liarity of phenomenology to embrace within the sphere ofits eidetic 
universality all cognitions and sciences and, more particularly, with 
respect to everything in them which is an object of immediate insight, or 
at least would have to be such if they were genuine cognitions. The 
sense and legitimacy of all possible immediate starting-points and of 
all immediate steps in any possible method lie within its sphere of 
jurisdiction. Thus phenomenology includes all the eidetic (therefore 
unconditionally and universally valid) cognitions with which the 
radical problems of “possibility” relating to any alleged cognitions 
and sciences become solved. As applied phenomenology, of essential 
necessity it produces the ultimately evaluative criticism of each 
specifically peculiar science; and thus, in particular, it determines the 
ultimate sense of the “being” of its objects and the fundamental 
clarification of its methods. Accordingly, it is understandable that 
phenomenology is, so to speak, the secret nostalgia of all modern 
philosophy. The striving toward phenomenology was present al­
ready in the wonderfully profound Cartesian fundamental considera­
tions; then, again, in the psychologism of the Lockean school; Hume 
almost set foot upon its domain, but with blinded eyes. And then the 
first to correctly see it was Kant, whose greatest intuitions become 
wholly understandable to us only when we had obtained by hard 
work a fully clear awareness of the peculiarity of the province 
<119) belonging to phenomenology. It then becomes evident to us that 
K ant’s mental regard was resting on that field, although he was still 
unable to appropriate it or recognize it as a field of work pertaining to 
a strict eidetic science proper. Thus, for example, the transcendental 
deduction in the first edition of the Kritik der reinen Vernunft was 
actually operating inside the realm of phenomenology, but Kant 
misinterpreted that realm as psychological and therefore he himself 
abandoned it.
But we are anticipating matters to be presented later (in the Third 
Book of this essay). Let the preliminary indications stated here 
serve to justify us in calling the complex"of sciences which undergo 
reduction “dogmatic” and in contrasting them with phenomenology 
as a science pertaining to a completely different dimension. At the

same time we draw a parallel contrast between the dogmatic and the 
phenomenological attitude. Obviously the natural attitude is then sub­
ordinate to the dogmatic attitude as a particularity.
Mote
The circumstance that the specifically phenomenological exclusions 
we have expounded are independent of the eidetic exclusion of 
individual existence suggests the question of whether, within the 
limits drawn by those exclusions, a factual science of transcendental- 
ly reduced mental processes is possible. This question, like every 
other question concerning fundamental essential possibilities, can be 
answered only within the realm of eidetic phenomenology. The 
answer is such that it becomes understandable why any attempt to 
start naively with a phenomenological science of matters of fact, 
before developing the phenomenological theory of essences, would be 
nonsense. For it is apparent that, alongside the extra-phenomenolo- 
gical sciences of matters of fact, there can be no phenomenological 
science of matters of fact as a science parallel to and co-ordinate with 
them. The reason for this is that the ultimate evaluation of all the 
sciences of matters of fact leads to a unitary link connecting the 
factual phenomenological contexts and the phenomenological con­
texts motivated as factual possibilities which correspond to all those 
sciences — a connected unity which is nothing else than the field 
belonging to the missing phenomenological sciences of matters of 
fact. A major part of this science is therefore a “phenomenological 
conversion” of the ordinary sciences of matters of fact which eidetic 
phenomenology makes possible; and the only remaining question is 
whether, starting from there, something more should be done.

§63. The Particular Significance of Methodic Deliberations for Phenomenolo­
gy-
If we heed the norms prescribed by the phenomenological reduc­
tions, if, as they demand, we exclude precisely all transcendencies 
and if, therefore, we take mental processes purely as they are with 
respect to their own essence, then, according to all that has been said, 
a field for eidetic cognitions is opened up to us. Once the initial 
difficulties have been overcome, it presents itself as infinite on every 
side. The multiplicity of kinds and forms of mental processes, with 
their really inherent and essential intentional constituents, is indeed 
inexhaustible as is, accordingly, the multiplicity of concatenations of 
essences and apodictically necessary truths based on <those kinds and 
forms>. This infinite field of the Apriori of consciousness which, in its 
peculiar ownness, has never received its due, indeed, has actually 
never been seen, must be brought under cultivation, then, and made 
to yield its fullest fruits. But how can we find the right beginning? As a 
m atter of fact, the beginning is what is most difficult here, and the 
situation is unusual. The new field does not lie spread out before our 
view with a wealth of salient data in such a manner that we can 
simply reach out and be sure of the possibility of making them the 
objects of a science — to say nothing of being sure of the method by 
which we ought to proceed.
If we attempt to increase our knowledge of them by investigative 
activities of our own, the situation here is not as it is in the case of what 
is given in the natural attitude, particularly in the case of objects 
belonging to Nature which, because of continuous experience and
1

however, should be taken into account and, in part, introduced into the exposition of 
phenomenology itself.

ways of thinking which have been practised for centuries, are quite 
familiar to us with respect to manifold peculiarities, with respect to 
their elements and laws. Anything unknown there is a horizon of 
something known. Every methodic effort starts from something 
given; every further development of the method starts from the 
method already on hand; generally speaking, it is only a m atter of 
developing special methods which fit into the already given and fixed 
style of a tested set of general scientific methods the discovery of 
which is guided by that style.
<121) 
How different it is in phenomenology. It is not only that, prior to 
any method for determining matters within its field, a method is 
needed in order to bring, without exception, the field of affairs 
pertaining to transcendentally pure consciousness within the regard 
which seizes upon it; it is not only that this requires a difficult turning 
of the regard from the natural data which continue to be objects of 
consciousness and are thus, as it were, interwoven with the data 
newly intended to, so that the danger of confusing the two sets of data 
is always threatening; but it is also that everything helpful to us in the 
case of the natural sphere of objects is lacking: familiarity by virtue of 
long-practiced intuition, the benefit of inherited theorizations and 
methods adapted to the subject-matter. Obviously, even in the case 
of methods already developed there is lacking that comfortable 
confidence which would be nourished by a multiplicity of successful 
and confirmed applications in the accepted sciences and in the 
practice of daily life.
In making its first appearance phenomenology must therefore 
reckon with a fundamental mood of skepticism. It must not only 
develop the method for acquiring novel cognitions from the novel 
subject-matter; with respect to the sense and validity of that method 
it must produce the most perfect clarity so that it can meet every 
serious objection.
In addition — and this, because it pertains to something essential­
ly fundamental, is much more important — phenomenology, by 
virtue ofits essence, must claim to be “first” philosophy and to offer 
the means for carry ingout every possible critique of reason; therefore 
it demands the most perfect freedom from presuppositions and, 
concerning itself, an absolute reflective insight. It is ofits own essence 
to realize the most perfect clarity concerning its own essence and 
therefore also concerning the principles ofits method.
For these reasons the painstaking efforts to acquire insight into the

basic components of its method, into that which is methodically 
determinative for the new science from its very inception and conti­
nually throughout its progress, have a significance for phenomenolo­
gy quite distinct from that which analogous efforts could ever have 
for other sciences.
§ 64. The Phenomenologists Self-Exclusion.
We must mention, first of all, a methodological objection which 
blocks even the first steps.
We exclude the entire natural world and all transcendent-eidetic 
spheres; by so doing we should acquire a “pure” consciousness. But < 122) 
have we not just said that “we” exclude? Can we phenomenologists, 
who are indeed included among the members of the natural world, 
put ourselves out of action?
One is soon convinced that there is no difficulty whatever in so 
doing, provided that we have not shifted the sense of “excluding.”
We can even go on calmly speaking in the way we must as natural 
human beings; for as phenomenologists we are not supposed to stop 
being natural human beings or positing ourselves as such when we 
speak. But as a part of the method for ascertaining the truths which 
are to be entered in the registry book of phenomenology, which we 
are about to begin, we prescribe for ourselves the norm of phenome­
nological reduction which is concomitantly related to our empirical 
factual being and prevents us from entering any proposition which 
contains, explicitly or implicitly, natural positions of that kind. In so 
far as it is a m atter of individual factual being, the phenomenologists 
proceed like any other eidetic scientist, e.g., the geometer. In their 
scientific treatises geometers often speak of themselves and their 
research; but the mathematizing2 subject is not included among the 
eidetic contents of mathematical propositions themselves.
§65. The Reflexive Reference of Phenomenology to Itself.
Again, it might be found objectionable that in the phenomenological 
attitude we direct our regard to some pure mental processes or other
2 Insertion in Copy A: human

in order to explore them, but that the mental processes of this 
research itself, with this attitude and line of vision, should, when 
taken in phenomenological purity at the same time belong to the 
realm to be explored.
Here, too, there is no difficulty. The situation is precisely similar in 
psychology and likewise in logical noetics. The thinking of the 
psychologist is itself something psychological; the thinking of the 
logician is something logical, i.e., something which lies within the 
realm to which the norms of logic apply. This reflexive reference to 
themselves would be of concern only if the phenomenological, psy­
chological, or logical cognition of the thinking currently done by the 
particular thinker were a condition on which the cognition of all the 
other things in the respective provinces of research would depend. But 
that is an obviously absurd proposition.
Admittedly, a certain difficulty is involved in all disciplines reflex- 
ively related to themselves, in that the first introduction to them, as 
<123) well as the first investigative penetration into them, must operate 
with methodic resources to which <the discipline in question> can only 
subsequently give a scientifically definitive form. Without prelimi­
nary and preparatory deliberations on its subject-matter and 
method, no new science could ever be projected. But the concepts and 
the other elements of method with which an incipient psychology or 
phenomenology operates in such preparatory efforts are themselves 
psychological or phenomenological and acquire their scientific 
stamp only within the system of the science after the latter has 
already been legitimated.
Obviously no serious objections which could hinder the actual 
development ofsuch sciences, particularly phenomenology, are to be 
found along the way. If phenomenology, then, is to be entirely a 
science within the limits of mere immediate Intuition, a purely “descriptive” 
eidetic science, then what is universal ofits procedure is already given 
as something obvious. It must expose to its view events of pure 
consciousness as examples <and> make them perfectly clear; within 
the limits of this clarity it must analyze and seize upon their essences, 
trace with insight the essential interconnections, formulate what is 
beheld in faithful conceptual expressions which allow their sense to 
be prescribed purely by what is beheld or generically seen; and so 
forth. This procedure, followed naively, serves at first only for the 
sake of looking about in the new province, acquiring some general 
practice in seeing, seizing upon and analyzing in it and becoming

somewhat familiar with its data. Then scientific reflection on the 
essence of the procedure itself, on the essence of the modes of given­
ness functioning in it, on the essence, the effect, the conditions of 
perfect clarity and insight as well as of perfectly faithful and fixed 
conceptual expression, and on other such things, now takes on the 
function of a generical and logically rigorous grounding of the 
method. Consciously followed, it now assumes the characteristic and 
rank of a scientific method which, in any given case, allows for 
practicing a limiting and improving criticism by applying the strictly 
formulated norms of method. Here the essential relatedness of phe­
nomenology to itself becomes manifest in that what reflection on the 
method examines and ascertains under the headings of clarity, in­
sight, expression, and the like, is, on its side, itself included in the 
domain of phenomenology and that all the reflective analyses which 
are phenomenological analyses of essences and the acquired method­
ological insights, with respect to what they ascertain, must square 
with the norms which they formulate. Therefore one must be able to < 124) 
persuade oneself at any time, by new reflections, that the predicative- 
ly formed affair-complexes asserted in the methodological state­
ments can be given with perfect clarity, that the concepts used 
actually conform faithfully to what is given, etc.
W hat has just been said obviously holds for all methodological 
investigations relating to phenomenology, no m atter how far we 
might extend their limits; we therefore understand that this whole 
essay, which aims at preparing the way for phenomenology, is itself 
phenomenology throughout.
§66. Faithful Expression of Clear Data. Unambiguous Terms.
Let us directly follow a bit further the most universal methodological 
thoughts which have come out in the previous sections. In phenome­
nology, then, which is to be nothing else but a theory of essences 
<produced> within pure intuition, we perform acts of seeing essences 
immediately in given examples of transcendentally pure conscious­
ness and fix them conceptually and terminologically. The words used 
may derive from the common language; they may be ambiguous and 
their changing senses may be vague. As soon as they “coincide55 with 
the intuitionally given in the m anner characteristic of an actual 
expression, they take on a definite sense as their actually present and

clear sense, hie et nunc; and starting from there we can fix them 
scientifically.
To be sure, not everything has been done in merely applying the 
word in faithful conformity to the essence seized upon intuitionally, 
even though everything necessary may have been carried out in so far 
as this intuitive seizing-upon is concerned. Science is possible only 
where the results of thinking can be stored up in the form of knowl­
edge and used for later thinking in the form of a system of statements 
which are distinct in their logical sense and can be understood or 
actualized in a judging, but without clearness in the underlying 
objectivatings and therefore without insight. O f course, <science> 
requires at the same time subjectivevand objective provisions for the 
reproducing at will (and, more particularly, intersubjectively) the 
relevant groundings and actual insights.
All of that, now, requires that the same words and sentences 
preserve an unambiguous coordination with certain intuitionally 
apprehensible essences which make up their “fulfilling sense.” On the 
ground, then, of eidetic intuition and thoroughly practised intuitions
< 125) of single examples they are furnished with distinct and single signifi­
cations (the other significations which occasionally emerge by force 
of habit being, as it were, “cancelled” ) in such a manner that, in all 
possible concatenations of actually present thinking, they keep their 
concepts produced by thinking and lose their capacity of conforming 
to other intuitional data with other fulfilling essences. Since, for good 
reasons in view of the existing ambiguities of common usage, foreign 
technical terms should, in so far as possible, be avoided in the 
generally accepted language, there is a continuing need for caution 
and for frequent re-examination to see whether what was fixed in the 
earlier context is actually employed in the same sense in the new one. 
But this is not the place for going more precisely into these and similar 
rules (including, e.g., those relating to science as a product of inter- 
subjective collaboration).

§67. The Method of Clarification .3 “Nearness of Givenness33 and 
“Remoteness of Givenness/3*
O f greater interest to us are methodological deliberations relating, 
not to expression, but to the essences and essential concatenations to 
be expressed by it and to be seized upon prior <to being expressed>. If 
our inquiring regard is directed to mental processes they will general­
ly offer themselves with an emptiness and a vague remoteness which make 
them useless for either single or eidetic findings. The situation would 
be different if, instead of those mental processes themselves, we were 
interested in their mode of givenness and if we wished to explore the 
essence of emptiness or vagueness itself which, for their part, become 
given in such cases with the fullest clarity rather than vaguely. But if 
something itself vaguely intended to, e.g., the obscurely hovering 
object of memory or phantasy, is asked to deliver up its essence, then 
what it delivers up will have to be something imperfect; that is, where 
those intuitions of single particulars which are the basis for seizing upon 
an essence have a low degree of clarity, the seizings upon the essence 
likewise <have a low degree of clarity>; and, correlatively, what is 
seized upon is, in respect ofits sense, “unclear:93 it is hazy, undecisively 
separated both internally and externally. One cannot decide, or can 
decide “only roughly,” whether what is seized upon here and what is 
seized upon there as the same (or the same essence); one cannot 
ascertain what components are actually included in it, or what those 
components “really are” which perhaps are already shown by vague 
contrast or are indicated in a wavering fashion.
That which floats before us in fluid unclarity, with a greater or less < 126) 
intuitional remoteness, must therefore be brought into normal near­
ness and made perfectly clear before it can be used as the basis for a 
correspondingly valuable eidetic intuition in which the essences and 
eidetic relationships intended to attain perfect givenness.
Thus the seizing upon essences itself has its degrees of clarity, as does 
the single particular floating before us. However, just as there is for 
the moment corresponding to it in the individual, there is for any 
essence an absolute nearness, so to speak, in which its givenness, com­
pared to the series of degrees of clarity, in an absolute — i.e., a pure 
givenness of it itself. We are aware of what is objective [das Gegenstand-

liche <scl. either the objective essence or the individual] not merely 
somehow or other as “it itself5 standing in view and as “given,” but 
as a purely given something itself, completely and precisely as it is in itself. 
In so far as a residue of unclarity remains, it casts a shadow over 
certain moments in that which is “itself5 given and, accordingly, 
those moments remain outside the circle of light suffusing the purely 
given. In the case of complete unclarity, the polar opposite to complete 
clarity, nothing at all has become given; the consciousness is “blind,” 
is no longer in the least intuitive, is not at all a “presentive” consciousness 
in the proper sense.5 As a consequence, we have to say:
A presentive consciousness in the pregnant sense and an intuitive conscious­
ness in contradistinction to a non-intuitive consciousness, a clear cons­
ciousness in contradistinction to an unclear one: these coincide. The 
same holds for degrees of givenness, of intuitedness, and of clarity. The 
zero-limit is complete obscurity; the limit, one, is complete clarity, 
intuitedness, givenness.
In this context, however, givenness must not be understood as 
originary givenness and therefore not as perceptual. We do not 
identify what is “given as it itself ’ with what is “given originarily ” “given 
in person ” In the definitely characterized sense, “given” and “given 
as it itself’ are the same; and our employment of the redundant 
expression serves only to 
givenness in the broader sense in which it
is said, ultimately, concerning anything objectively intended to [je- 
dem Vorstelligen] that it is given in the intending to it [ Vorstellung] 
(though perhaps in an “empty m anner” ).6
As can be seen immediately, our definitions apply moreover to any 
intuitions and empty objectivatings [Leervorstellungen\, and therefore 
without any restriction with respect to the objectivities,7 although we are 
<127) interested here only in the manners in which mental processes and 
their phenomenological (really inherent and intentive) components 
are given.
But in consideration of future analyses, it should be also noted that 
the most essential part of the situation remains: whether or not the 
regard of the pure Ego goes through the mental processes in question; 
stated more precisely, whether or not the pure Ego “adverts to” a

“datum ” and perchance “seizes upon” it. Accordingly, for example, 
“perceptually given” — instead of being tantam ount to “perceived” 
in the proper and normal sense of seizing upon this datum  in its being
— can signify merely “ready for perception.” In like manner, “given 
in the mode characteristic of phantasy” need notsignify “seized upon 
in a phantasying;” and the like is true universally and with respect to 
all degrees of clarity or obscurity. We refer in advance to “readiness,” 
which is to be discussed in detail later on, and wish to say at the same 
time that where nothing to the contrary is added or obvious from the 
context, under the heading of “givenness” we also understand being 
seized upon and, in the case of givenness of an essence, being seized 
upon originarily.
§68. Genuine and Spurious Degrees of Clarity. The Essence of Normal 
Clarification.
But we must still continue our descriptions. If we speak of degrees of 
givenness or clarity, we must distinguish between genuine graded 
degrees of clarity, with which one may include, in the same series, 
graded degrees of obscurity; and spurious degrees of clarity, namely extensive 
broadenings of the sphere of clarity, perhaps with a simultaneous intensive 
enhancement of clarity.
An already given, already actually intuited moment, e.g., a tone or 
a color, can be given with greater or less clarity. Let us exclude all 
apprehendings which reach out beyond what is given intuitionally.
We are dealing then with a number of graded degrees which occur 
inside the limits within which the intuited moment is indeed actually 
intuited; intuitedness as intuitedness admits of continuous intensity­
like differences under the heading of clarity which, like intensities, 
begin with zero but end with a fixed upper limit. One might say that 
the lower degrees indicate the latter in a certain fashion; intuiting a 
color in a mode bf imperfect clarity, we “m ean” the color as it is “in 
itself’ — i.e., precisely the color given with perfect clarity. Neverthe­
less one must not let oneself be misled by the metaphor of indicating < 128)
— as though one thing were a sign of another; nor may one speak 
here (we recall something noted once before)8 of a presentation of the 
“In itself’ by virtue of the unclear, somewhat as a physical property

becomes “presented,” i.e., adumbrated, in intuition by virtue of a 
moment belonging to sensation. Graded differences in clarity are exclusive­
ly differences of a peculiar kind in the mode of givenness.9
The situation is quite different where an apprehending which 
reaches out beyond the intuitionally given interweaves empty appre­
hendings with the actually intuitive apprehendings so that, in a 
quasi-graded fashion, more of what is emptily intended to can become 
intuited and, conversely, more of what is already intuited can be­
come emptily intended to. Accordingly, in this case making something 
clear to oneself consists of processes of two kinds which combine with 
one another: processes of actualizing intuition and processes of enhancing the 
clarity of what is already intuited.10
But that is a description of the essence of normal clarification. For, as a 
rule, it is not the case that pure intuitions are present or that pure 
empty intendings turn into pure intuitions; rather it is normally the 
case that, perhaps as intermediate stages, impure intuitions play a 
major role, <intuitions> which make their objects intuited with respect 
to certain sides or moments, but intend to them only emptily with 
respect to others.
§69. The Method of Perfectly Clear Seizing Upon Essences.
In consequence ofits essence,perfectly clear seizing-upon has the advan­
tage that it allows for an absolutely certain identifying and distin­
guishing, explicating, relating, and so forth, thus allowing for effec­
ting all “logical” acts “with insight.” The acts of seizing upon essences also 
belong among these acts to the correlates of which, as already said 
above, the differences in clarity, to be spelled out now in greater 
detail, are transferred just as, on the other hand, the methodological 
cognitions we just now acquired are transferred to the attainment of 
a perfect givenness of essences.
Thus the method, which is afundamental part of the method of all eidetic 
science, universally requires proceeding step by step. The intuitions of 
single particulars serving the seizing upon essences may be already 
clear to an extent which allows for acquiring an essentially universal 
<129) moment which, however, does not extend as far as the guiding

intention; clarity is lacking on the side pertaining to more detailed 
determinations of the essences combined with <what had been attain­
ed), consequently there is a need to bring the exemplificatory single 
particulars nearer or to provide anew more suitable ones in which the 
confusedly and obscurely single traits intended to stand out and, 
consequently, can become given with maximum clarity.
A bringing nearer is effected here throughout, even in the sphere of 
obscurity. W hat is obscurely intended to comes closer to us in its own 
manner; finally it knocks at the door of intuition, but even so it need 
not come in (and perhaps it cannot “because of psychological obs­
tructions” ).
It should also be mentioned that what is given at any particular time is 
usually surrounded by a halo of undetermined determinability, which has its 
mode of being brought closer “explicatively” in becoming separated 
into a number of in tendings [Vorstellungen]] at first it still may be in 
the realm of obscurity, but then within the sphere of givenness until 
what is intended to comes into the sharply illuminated circle of 
perfect givenness.
Attention should also be called to the fact that it would doubtless 
be too much to say that all evidence in seizing upon essences requires a 
complete clarity of the underlying single particulars in their concreteness. To 
seize upon the most universal eidetic differences, like those between 
color and sound and between perception and will, it is doubtless 
sufficient that the examples be given with a low degree of clarity. It is 
as though the most universal, the genus (color taken universally, 
sound taken universally) were given completely but not as yet the 
differentia. The phraseology is objectionable, but I see no way of 
avoiding it. Let the reader make the situtation present to himself in 
living intuition.
§70. The Role of Perception in the Method of Eidetic Clarification. The 
Primacy of Free Phantasy.
Let us bring out a few especially important features of the method 
followed in seizing upon essences.
It is of the universal essence of the immediately intuitive seizing 
upon essences that (as we have already emphasized11) it can be

effected on the ground of a mere presentiation of exemplificative single 
particulars. Presentiation, e.g., phantasy, however, as we have just 
<130) explained, can be so perfectly clear that it makes possible a perfect 
seizing upon essences and a perfect eidetic insight. Originarily presen- 
live perception in general and, of course, external perception in particu­
lar, has its primacies over all kinds of presentiation not merely as an 
experiencing act for findings about factual being (which, after all, do 
not concern us here), but also as a foundation for phenomenological 
eidetic findings. External perception has its perfect clarity with 
respect to all the objective moments actually given in it in the mode of 
originariness.12 But it also offers, perhaps with the cooperation of 
reflection related back to it, clear and steady singularizations for 
universal eidetic analyses of a phenomenological kind, more precise­
ly even for act-analyses. Anger may be evaporated, its content may be 
quickly modified by reflection. Nor is it always available like percep­
tion, producible at any time by easy experimental arrangements. To 
study it reflectively in its originariness is to study an evaporating 
anger which, to be sure, is by no means insignificant but may not be 
what ought to be studied. In contrast, external perception, which is 
so much more accessible, is not “evaporated” by reflection; its 
universal essence and the essence of its components and essential 
correlates universally belonging to it can be studied within the limits 
of originariness without particular efforts to produce clarity.13 If it 
be said that perception also has its differences in clarity, namely with 
reference to cases of perception in the dark, in a fog, etc., we do not 
wish to become involved in more precise deliberations about whether 
or not these differences should be placed on a par with those already 
discussed. It is sufficient that perception is not normally beclouded 
and that clear perception is always at our disposal when we need it.
If the primacies of originariness were very important for our 
method we should now have to consider where, how, and to what 
extent they are realizable in the various kinds of mental processes, 
which kinds of mental processes come especially close in this respect 
to the privileged sphere of sense perception, and many other similar 
questions. But all that may be disregarded. There are reasons by 
virtue of which in phenomenology, as in all other eidetic sciences, 
presentiations and, more precisely, f r e e  phantasies acquire a position of
12 Insertion in Copy A: and corresponding to the perfection with which they are so given

primacy over perceptions and do so even in the phenomenology of perception <131) 
itself , excluding, to be sure, the phenomenology of the Data of sensation.
In his investigative thinking the geometer operates on the figure or 
model incomparably more in phantasy than in perception, and even 
more so does the “ pure” geometer, i.e., the one who dispenses with 
algebraic methods. In phantasy, to be sure, he must make an effort to 
attain clear intuitions from which he is exempted by the sketch or 
model. But in actually sketching and constructing a model he is 
restricted; in phantasy he has incomparably more freedom reshap­
ing at will the figures feigned, and in running through continuously 
modified possible shapings, thus in generating an immense number 
of new formations; a freedom opens up to him for the very first time an 
access to the expanses of essential possibilities with their infinite 
horizons of eidetic cognitions. For that reason the sketches normally 
come after the phantasy-constructions and the eidetically pure think­
ing done on the basis of the latter and serve chiefly to fix certain 
stages in the previously performed process, thereby making it easier 
to presentiate again. Even where one “ponders” while looking at the 
figure, the processes of thinking which follow are, with respect to 
their sensuous substratum, processes of phantasy the results of which 
fix the new lines in the figure.
In its most universal features, the situation is no different for the 
phenomenologist who deals with reduced mental processes and their 
eidetically necessary correlates. There are also infinitely many eide­
tic phenomenological formations. He too can use the resource of 
originary givenness only to a limited extent. To be sure, in the mode 
of originary givenness he has at his free disposal all the chief types of 
perceptions and presentiations as perceivable exemplifications for a 
phenomenology of perception, phantasy, memory, etc. In so far as 
the most universal essences are concerned, in the sphere of originari- 
ness he has at his command in the same way examples of judgings, 
deemings likely, feelings, and willings. However, of course <he does 
not have examples> for all possible particular formations any more 
than the geometer has sketches or models at his disposal for the 
infinitely many kinds of solids. Here, in any case, the freedom of 
eidetic research also necessarily demands operating in phantasy.
While on the other hand (and, again, as in geometry which not 
without reason has recently attached great value to collections of 
models and the like), naturally, it is necessary to exercise one’s <132) 
phantasy abundantly in the required activity of perfect clarification

and in the free reshaping ofphantasy-data, it is also necessary, before 
doing that, to fertilize one’s phantasy by observations in originary 
intuition which are as abundant and excellent as possible: whereby 
this is not to say that experience as experience has here a function in 
grounding validity. Extraordinary profit can be drawn from the 
offerings of history, in even more abundant measure from those of 
art, and especially from poetry, which are, to be sure, imaginary but 
which, in the originality of their invention of forms [Neugestaltungen], 
the abundance of their single features and the unbrokenness of their 
motivation, tower high above the products of our own phantasy and, 
in addition, when they are apprehended understandingly, become 
converted into perfectly clear phantasies with particular ease owing 
to the suggestive power exerted by artistic means of presentation.
Thus if one is fond of paradoxical phrases, one can actually say, 
and if one means the ambiguous phrase in the right sense, one can say 
in strict truth, that “feigning” [Fiktion”] makes up the vital element of 
phenomenology as of every other eidetic science, that feigning is the source 
from which the cognition of “eternal truths” is fed.14
§71. The Problem of the Possibility of a Descriptive Eidetics of Mental 
Processes.
Repeatedly in the foregoing we have characterized phenomenology 
simply as a descriptive science. There again a fundamental question 
of method arises, and a consideration which checks us, eager though 
we may be to penetrate the new province. Is it correct to set for 
phenomenology the tasks of mere description? A descriptive eidetics— is that not 
something altogether wrong?
The motives for such questions are sufficiently obvious in all of us. 
Anyone who in our fashion is, so to speak, feeling his way into a new 
eidetics, asking what kind of inquiries are possible here, what starting 
points should be taken and what methods should be followed, looks 
involuntarily at the old highly developed eidetic disciplines, thus at 
the mathematical disciplines, especially geometry and arithmetic. 
We note immediately, however, that these disciplines cannot be 
called upon to offer guidance in our case, that in them the relations
14a L 'T H o r ’s  f o o t n o t e :  A s e n t e n c e  w h i c h ,  a s  a  q u o t a t i o n ,  should b e  e s p e c i a l l y  s u i t a b l e  f o r  a  
n a t u r a l i s t i c  r i d i c u l i n g  o f  t h e  e i d e t i c  m o d e  o f  c o g n i t i o n .

must be essentially different. For the person who has not yet become <133) 
acquainted with any piece of genuine phenomenological eidetic 
analysis there is some danger here of becoming puzzled about the 
possibility of a phenomenology. Since the mathematical disciplines 
are the only ones which can at present represent in an effective 
manner the idea of a scientific eidetics, he will at first be far from 
thinking that there could be eidetic disciplines of another kind, non- 
mathematical eidetic disciplines fundamentally different from the 
familiar eidetic disciplines in their whole theoretical kind. Therefore 
if he has let himself be won over by general considerations to the 
belief that a phenomenological eidetics is required, the immediately 
abortive attempt to establish anything like a mathematics of pheno­
mena can mislead him into a relinquishing of the idea of a phenome­
nology. But that would really be wrong.
Let us make clear to ourselves the most universal peculiarities of 
mathematical disciplines as contrasted with those of an eidetic theory of mental 
processes9 and let us therefore make clear what those aims and me­
thods really are which, as we have suggested, are essentially inappro­
priate to the sphere of mental processes.
§72. Eidetic Sciences: Concrete, Abstract, “Mathematical”
We start from the division of essences and eidetic sciences into 
material and formal. The formal ones we can eliminate (thereby 
eliminating the whole set of formal mathematical disciplines), since 
phenomenology obviously belongs among the material eidetic scien­
ces. If analogy can be any guide to method, it will act most powerfully 
if we restrict ourselves to material mathematical disciplines like, for 
example, geometry and accordingly ask more specifically whether a 
phenomenology must be, or can be, constituted as a “geometry” of 
mental processes.
To acquire the insight desired here, it is necessary to bear in mind 
some important findings which belong to the general theory of 
science.15
Any theoretical science unites an ideally closed totality by refer­
ence to a province of knowledge which, for its part, is determined by a
15a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  Inconnection with the further exposition, cf. above Part One, Chapter 
One, especially §§12, 15 and 16.

< 134) higher genus. A radical unity is attained only when we go back to the 
absolutely highest genus, i.e., when we go back to the particular 
region and to the components of the regional genus, i.e., to the 
highest genera united in the regional genus, genera which may be 
based one upon another. The structure of the highest concrete genius 
(the region), made up in part of discrete highest genera and in part of 
highest genera founded one upon another (and, in this fashion, 
embracing one another), corresponds to the structure of the subordi­
nate concreta made up in part of discrete lowest species and in part of 
lowest species founded one upon the other; for example, in the case of 
the physical thing, temporal determinateness, spatial determinate­
ness and material determinateness. To each region there corresponds 
a regional ontology which comprises a number of regional sciences 
either self-sufficiently closed or perhaps based one upon another, 
corresponding precisely to the highest genera which are united in 
making up the region. To subordinate genera mere disciplines or so- 
called theories correspond — e.g., the discipline pertaining to conic 
sections corresponds to the genus conic section. In conceptual terms, 
such a discipline has no complete self-sufficiency, since in its cogni­
tions and in their cognitive groundings it naturally must have at its 
disposal the entire foundation of eidetic cognitions which derives its 
unity from the highest genus.
In accordance with whether the highest genera are regional (con­
crete) or merely components of regional genera, the sciences are either 
concrete or abstract. The distinction obviously corresponds to the uni­
versal distinction between concrete and abstract genera.16 Conse­
quently the province is made up either of concrete objects (as in the 
case of the eidetics of Nature) or else of abstract objects (such as 
spatial shapes, temporal shapes, or the shapes of movements). The 
essential relationship of all abstract genera to concrete and ultimate­
ly to regional genera gives to all abstract disciplines and complete 
abstract sciences an essential relationship to concrete sciences and 
<ultimately> to the regional sciences.
The division of eidetic sciences has its exact parallel, moreover, in a 
division of the experiential sciences. They too are distinguished from 
one another with respect to the regions. We have, for example, one 
physical science of Nature; and all the single sciences of Nature are 
properly mere disciplines: the potent set of laws, not only eidetic but

also empirical, which pertain to Nature as a whole prior to any 
separation into spheres of Nature, gives them unity. In addition, 
different regions can prove to be interconnected by empirical laws, as 
for example the region of the physical and the region of the psychical. <135)
If we look now at the familiar eidetic sciences, we are struck by the 
fact that their procedure is not descriptive, that, e.g., the lowest eidetic 
species, that is to say, the countless spatial shapes which can be drawn 
in space, are not seized upon in intuitions of single particulars, 
described and ordered into classes by geometry, as do the empirical 
sciences of Nature with respect to the empirical formations of Nature.
On the contrary, geometry fixes a few kinds of fundamental structu­
res, the ideas of solid, plane, point, angle, and the like, the ones which 
play the determining role in the “axioms.” With the help of the 
axioms, i.e., the primitive eidetic laws, it is then in a position to derive 
purely deductively all the spatial shapes “existing,” that is, ideally 
possible <shapes>, in space and all the eidetic relationships pertaining 
to those shapes in the form of exactly determining concepts which 
take the place of the essences which, as a rule, remain foreign to our 
intuition. The generic essence of the province of geometry, or the 
pure essence of space, is of such a character that geometry can be 
completely certain of dominating actually by its method all the 
possibilities and of determining them exactly. In other words, the 
multiplicity comprising all spatial formations has a remarkable fun­
damental logical property, indicated in the names, “definite manifold99 
and “mathematical manifold in the pregnant sense 99 which we hereby 
introduce.
Such a manifold is characterized by the fact that a finite number of 
concepts and propositions derivable in a given case from the essence of the 
province in question, in the manner characteristic of purely analytic necessity 
completely and unambiguously determines to totality of all the possible forma­
tions belonging to the province so that, of essential necessity, nothing in the 
province is left open.
We can also say that such a manifold has the distinctive property of 
being “mathematically-exhaustively definable.99 The “definition” consists 
of the system of axiomatic concepts and axioms; and the “m athema­
tically exhaustive” consists of the fact that the defining assertions 
involve the greatest conceivable prejudgment [Prajudiz\ concerning 
the manifold: nothing remains undetermined.
An equivalent of the concept of a definite manifold is contained in 
the following propositions:

Any proposition which can be constructed out of the distinctive 
<136) axiomatic concepts, regardless ofits logical form, is either a pure 
formal-logical consequence of the axioms or else a pure formal- 
logical anti-consequence — that is to say, a proposition formally 
contradicting the axioms, so that its contradictory opposite would be 
a formal-logical consequence of the axioms. In the case of a mathemati­
cally definite manifold the concepts “true” and “formal-logical consequence of 
the axioms” are equivalent; and so are the concepts “false” and “formal- 
logical anti-consequence of the axioms.”
A system of axioms which, in the manner indicated, “exhaustively 
defines” a manifold purely analytically is what I call also a definite 
system of axioms. Any deductive discipline based on such a system is a 
definite discipline or, in the pregnant sense, one which is mathematical.
The definitions continue to exist collectively if we let the material 
particularization of the manifold become completely undetermined
— that is to say, if we undertake formalizing universalization. The 
system of axioms then changes into a system of forms of axioms; the 
manifold, into a form of manifolds; and the discipline, into a 
discipline-form.17
§73. Application to the Problem of Phenomenology. Description and Exact 
Determination.
W hat can be said, then, about phenomenology in comparison with 
geometry as a representative of all material mathematics? It is clear 
that phenomenology belongs among the concrete-eidetic disciplines. 
Its extension is made up of essences of mental processes which are not 
abstracta but instead concreta. These concreta, as concreta, have
17 
a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : On this cf. Logische Untersuchungen, Vol. 11, §§69 and 70. - The concepts 
introduced here served me already at the beginning of the 1890’s (in the “Untersuchungen zur 
Theorie der formal-mathematischen Disziplinen” [“ Investigations Pertaining to the Theory of 
Formal-Mathematical Disciplines”], which I intended as a continuation of my Philosophie der 
Arithmetik) [Philosophy oj Arithmetic], namely to the purpose of finding a fundamental solution to 
the problem of the imaginary. (Cf. the brief reference, Logische Untersuchungen, V ol.I1, p. 250 
<English translation, p. 242>.) Since then I have often had occasion to develop the relevant 
concepts and theories in lectures and seminars, partly in complete detail; and in the winter 
semester of 1901 /02 [reading with Schuhmann, instead of 1900jOI as in the three printed editions] I dealt 
w ith them in a double lecture to the Gottingen Mathematical Society. Some parts of this train 
of thoughts have found their way into the literature, without mention of their original sources.
The close relationship of the concept of definiteness to the “axiom of completeness” 
introduced by Hilbert for the foundation of arithmetic will be immediately obvious to every 
mathematician.

abstract moments of many kinds; and the question now is: Do the 
highest genera pertaining to those abstract moments form provinces 
here for definite disciplines, “mathematical” disciplines after the 
manner of geometry? Must we accordingly look for a definite system < 137) 
of axioms here and erect a deductive system upon it? Correlatively, 
must we look for “fundamental formations” here, and from them 
derive by construction, i.e., deductively by a consequential applica­
tion of the axioms, all the other essential formations in the province 
and their essential determinations? But involved in the essence of 
such a deriving, and this must also be noted, is that it is a mediate 
logical determining the results of which, even if they are “drawn in 
the figure,” are of essential necessity incapable of being seized upon 
in immediate intuition. We can frame a correlative version of our 
question in these words: Is the stream of consciousness a genuine 
mathematical manifold? Taken in its factualness, is it like Nature, the 
Nature which physics is about, which indeed, if the ideal which 
guides the physicist is valid, and strictly conceived, must be charac­
terized as a concrete definite manifold?
A highly significant problem pertaining to the theory of science is 
that of becoming completely clear about all the relevant essential 
questions involved here; thus after the concept of the definite mani­
fold has been fixed, there is <the problem> of examining the conditions 
which a materially determined province must satisfy if it is to corres­
pond to that idea. One necessary condition is exactness in “concept- 
formation ” which is by no means a m atter of free choice and logical 
technique; rather, in the case of the supposedly axiomatic concepts 
which, after all, must be demonstrable in immediate intuition, it 
presupposes exactness in the essences themselves which are seized upon. But 
the extent to which “exact” essences can be found in a particular 
eidetic province, and whether exact essences can be seized upon in 
actual intuition as substructing all essences and accordingly as sub- 
structing all their eidetic components too, are matters depending 
entirely on the peculiar nature of the province in question.
The problem just mentioned is intimately related to the funda­
mental and still unsolved problems pertaining to an essentially 
necessary clarification of the relationship between “description,” with 
its “descriptive concepts,” and “unambiguous determination” or “exact 
determination,” with its “ideal concepts”, and, parallel with that, a 
clarification of the so-little understood relationship between “des­
criptive” and “explanatory” sciences. An attempt to deal with these

problems will be communicated in the sequel to these investigations. 
Here the interruption of the main trend of our deliberations must not 
<138) be unduly prolonged; nor has our preparation been sufficient to 
enable us to treat such questions exhaustively. In what follows here it 
will be enough if we indicate in a general fashion some points 
deserving our consideration.
§ 74. Descriptive and Exact Sciences.
Let us connect our considerations to the contrast between geometry 
and descriptive natural science. The geometer is not interested in de 
facto sensuously intuitable shapes, as the descriptive natural scientist 
is. He does not, like the latter, fashion morphological concepts of vague 
configurational types which are directly seized upon on the basis of 
sensuous intuition and which, in their vagueness, become concept­
ually and terminologically fixed. The vagueness of such concepts, the 
circumstance that their spheres of application are fluid, does not 
make them defective; for in the spheres of knowledge where they are 
used they are absolutely indispensable, or in those spheres they are 
the only legitimate concepts. If the aim is to give appropriate concep­
tual expression to the intuitionally given essential characteristics of 
intuitionally given physical things, that means precisely that the 
latter must be taken as they are given. And they are given precisely as 
fluid; and typical essences can become seized upon as exemplified in 
them only in immediately analytic eidetic intuition. The most perfect 
geometry and the most perfect practical mastery of it cannot enable 
the descriptive natural scientist to express (in exact geometrical 
concepts) what he expresses in such a simple, understandable, and 
completely appropriate manner by the words “notches,” “scal­
loped,” “lens-shaped,” “umbelliform,” and the like — all to them 
concepts which are essentially, rather than accidentally, inexact and conse­
quently also non-mathematical.
Geometrical concepts are “ideal” concepts, expressing something 
which cannot be “seen;” their “origin” and therefore their content 
are essentially other than those of descriptive concepts; as concepts they 
express, not “ideals,” but essences drawn immediately from intuition 
simpliciter. Exact concepts have as their correlates essences which 
have the characteristic of “ideas'” in the Kantian sense. Contrasted with 
these ideas, or ideal essences, we find morphological essences as the 
correlates of descriptive concepts.

That ideation which yields ideal essences, as ideal “limits” which it 
is essentially impossible to find in any sensuous intuition but which 
morphological essences “approach” more or less closely without ever < 139) 
reaching them — this ideation is fundamentally different in its 
essence from the seizing upon an essence by simple “abstraction” in 
which a salient “moment” is raised into the region of essences as 
something essentially vague, as something typical.18 The firmness and 
the pure distinguishability of generic concepts, or generic essences, which 
have their extension in the realm of fluidity, must not be confused 
with the exactness of ideal concepts and of genera which include only the 
idea in their extension.19 It can then be seen, furthermore, that exact 
sciences and purely descriptive sciences do indeed combine but that they 
cannot take the place of the other, that no exact science, i.e., no 
science operating with ideal substructions, no m atter how highly 
developed, can perform the original and legitimate tasks of pure 
description.20
§ 75. Phenomenology as a Descriptive Eidetic Doctrine of Pure Mental Proces­
ses.
As for phenomenology, it is concerned to be a descriptive eidetic 
doctrine of transcendentally pure mental processes as viewed in the 
phenomenological attitude; and, like any other descriptive, non- 
substructing and non-idealizing discipline, it has its inherent legiti­
macy. W hatever can be apprehended eidetically in pure intuition as 
belonging to reduced mental processes, either as a really inherent 
component part or as an intentional correlate of the latter, properly 
belongs to phenomenology and is for it a great source of absolute 
cognitions.
But let us examine somewhat more closely the extent to which 
actually scientific descriptions can become established in the pheno­
menological field with its innumerable eidetic concreta, and what 
such descriptions are in a position to accomplish.
18 Marginal note inCopy A: Yet another fundamental kind ofabstraction is thalofforming formal- 
ontological eidetic concepts
19 Addition to this sentence in Copy A: nor with the cxactncss of formal-logical concepts, which are 
exact themselves. But the latter need not be considered here in the material sphere.
20 Marginal note inCopy A: That is not correct because thedifTerence between a limit-idea and a 
formal idea is not taken into consideration. On the other hand, material disciplines and material 
eidetic laws were the things to be considered here.

It is peculiar to consciousness of whatever sort that it fluctuates in 
flowing away in various dimensions in such a manner that there can 
be no speaking of a conceptually exact fixing of any eidetic concreta 
or of any of their immediately constitutive moments. Let us take, for 
example, a mental process of the genus, “phantasy of a physical 
thing,” as that process is given to us in a phenomenological- 
immanental perception or in an (always reduced) intuition of some 
other kind. Then the phenomenologically single example (the eidetic 
singularity) is that physical thing-phantasy in the entire fullness ofits 
concretion precisely as it flows smoothly in the flux of mental proces­
ses, precisely the determinateness and indeterminateness with which 
<140) it makes its physical thing appear now from one side and now from 
another, precisely in the distinctness or blurriness, in the vacillating 
clarity and intermittent obscurity, etc., which are indeed proper to it. 
Phenomenology not only drops the individuation but elevates the whole 
essential content, in the fullness of its concretion, into eidetic con­
sciousness and takes it as an ideally identical essence which, like any 
other essence, could be singularized not only hie et nunc but also in 
countless examples. One sees at once that there can be no thought of a 
conceptual and terminological fixing of this or any other such fluid 
concretum, and that the same holds with respect to each ofits immedi­
ate and no less fluid parts and abstract moments.
But though there can be no speaking of an unambiguous determi­
ning of eidetic singularities in our sphere of description, the situation is 
quite otherwise in the case of essences belonging to higher levels of 
specificity. These are accessible to rigid differentiation, to continuous 
identifying maintenance [Durchhaltung], and strict conceptual for­
mulation and likewise to analysis into component essences; and 
accordingly in their case the tasks of a comprehensive scientific 
description can be imposed as meaningful tasks.
Thus we describe and, in so doing, determine by strict concepts the 
generic essence of perception taken universally or that of subordinate 
species, such as the perception of physical things and their determi­
nations, the perception of animate beings, etc.; likewise the essence of 
memory taken universally, empathy taken universally, willing taken 
universally, etc. Prior to these, however, are the highest universali­
ties: the mental process taken universally, the cogitatio taken univer­
sally, which already make extensive essential descriptions possible.

The nature of the process of seizing upon, analyzing, and describing 
generic essences is obviously such that what can be done at higher 
levels is not dependent on what has been done at lower levels, e.g., in 
such a manner that a systematic inductive procedure might be the 
required method, a gradual ascending of the scale of increasing 
universality.
Still another consequence may be added here. According to what 
has been stated, deductive theorizings are excluded from phenome­
nology. Mediate inferences are not exactly denied to it; but, since all its 
cognitions ought to be descriptive, purely befitting the immanental 
sphere, inferences, non-intuitive modes of procedure of any kind, 
only have the methodic function of leading us to the matters in 
question upon which a subsequent direct seeing of essences must 
make given. Analogies which emerge may suggest presumed likeli­
hoods about concatenations of essences prior to actual intuition, and <141) 
conclusions may be drawn from them; but ultimately an actual 
seeing of the concatenations of essences must redeem the presumed 
likelihoods. As long as that has not occurred, we have no phenome­
nological result.
I n the eidetic province of reduced phenomena (either as a whole or 
in some partial province), this admittedly does not answer the 
pressing question of whether, besides the descriptive procedure, one 
might not follow — as a counterpart to descriptive phenomenology — 
an idealizing procedure which substitutes pure and strict ideals for 
intuited data and might even serve as the fundamental means for a 
mathesis of mental processes.
However much the investigations just carried out were compelled 
to leave open, they have advanced us considerably and not just by 
bringing a series of important problems within our field of vision. It is 
now completely clear to us that nothing of value for the establishing 
of phenomenology can be gained by proceeding according to analo­
gy. It is only a misleading prejudice to believe that the methods of 
historically given a priori sciences, all of which are exclusively22 exact 
sciences of ideal objects, must serve forthwith as models for every new 
science, particularly for our transcendental phenomenology — as 
though there could be23 eidetic sciences of but one single methodic 
type, that of “exactness.” Transcendental phenomenology, as a
22 Insertion in Copy D: throughout idealizing
23 Insertion in Copy A: only material

descriptive science of essence, belongs however to afundamental class of 
eidetic sciences totally different from the one to which the mathematical 
sciences belong.

§76. The Theme of the Following Investigations.
The realm of transcendental consciousness as the realm of what is, in a 
determined sense, “absolute” being, has been provided us by the 
phenomenological reduction. It is the primal category of all being 
(or, in our terminology, the primal region), the one in which all other 
regions of being are rooted, to which, according to their essence, they 
are relative and on which they are therefore all essentially depen­
dent. The theory of categories must start entirely from this most 
radical of all ontological distinctions — being as consciousness and 
being as something which becomes “manifested” in consciousness, 
“transcendent” being — which, as we see, can be attained in its 
purity and appreciated only by the method of the phenomenological 
reduction. In the essential relationship between transcendental and 
transcendent being are rooted all the relationships already touched on 
by us repeatedly but later to be explored more profoundly, between 
phenomenology and all other sciences — relationships in the sense of 
which it is implicit that the dominion of phenomenology includes in a 
certain remarkable manner all the other sciences. The excluding has at 
the same time the characteristic of a revaluing change in sign; and with this 
change the revalued affair finds a place once again in the phenomenological 
sphere. Figuratively speaking, that which is parenthesized is not 
erased from the phenomenological blackboard but only parenthesi­
zed, and thereby provided with an index. As having the latter it is, 
however, part of the major theme of inquiry.
It is absolutely necessary that this situation with the points of view 
peculiar to it be understood thoroughly. Included here is, for exam­
ple, the fact that physical Nature undergoes exclusion, while at the 
same time there is not only a phenomenology of natural-scientific 
consciousness as a matter of natural-scientific experiencing and think-
<142>

ing but also a phenomenology of Nature itself as the correlate of 
natural-scientific consciousness. Likewise, though psychology and 
the cultural sciences are affected by the excluding, there is a pheno­
menology of man, his personality, his personal properties and his 
(human) flow of consciousness; furthermore, a phenomenology of the 
social mind, of social formations, cultural products, etc. Everything 
transcendent, in as much as it becomes given in consciousness, is an 
object for phenomenological investigation not only with respect to 
the consciousness of it — e.g., the different modes of consciousness in 
which it becomes given as the same — but also, though this is 
essentially involved with the former, as what is given and accepted in 
the modes of givenness.
Thus there are immense domains of phenomenological research 
for which one is not in the least prepared when one starts out from the 
idea of the mental process — especially if one begins, as we all do, 
with the psychological attitude and has allowed the concept of the 
mental process to be prescribed for him in the first place by the 
psychology of our times — and which one will at first be little inclined 
to accept as at all phenomenological because of the influence of 
<143) internal hindrances. In the case of psychology and the cultural 
sciences this inclusion of what has been parenthesized results in quite 
peculiar and at first rather confusing situations. To indicate this only 
in the case of psychology we note that consciousness, as a datum  of 
psychological experience, thus as human or brute consciousness, is an 
object of psychology, in experiential-scientific research, an object of 
empirical psychology; in essential-scientific research, an object of 
eidetic psychology.1 On the other hand, as having the modification 
effected by parenthesizing, the whole world with all its psychical 
individuals and their psychical processes, belongs in phenomenolo­
gy: all of it as a correlate of absolute consciousness. Consciousness 
therefore makes its appearance here in different modes of apprehen­
sion and different contexts, and different ones moreover within 
phenomenology itself: namely, within the latter itself first as absolute 
consciousness and secondly, in the correlate, as psychological cons­
ciousness which occurs in the natural world — as in a certain manner 
revalued, yet without losing the content peculiar to it as conscious­
ness. Those are difficult and extraordinarily important contexts. 
They account for the fact that any phenomenological finding concer-

ning absolute consciousness can be reinterpreted as an eidetic- 
psychological finding (which, strictly considered, is itself by no me­
ans phenomenological), although here the phenomenological modes 
of observing things is the more inclusive and, as absolute, is the more 
radical mode. To see all this and consequently to confer a completely 
transparent clarity on the essential relationships between pure phe­
nomenology, on the one hand, and eidetic and empirical psychology 
(or cultural sciences, as the case may be) on the other hand, is of great 
concern to those disciplines and to philosophy. Specifically psycholo­
gy, which is aspiring so strongly in our times, can acquire the radical 
foundation still lacking to it only if it has at its command far-reaching 
insights into the essential contexts indicated.
The indications just given make us sensible of how far we still are 
from an understanding of phenomenology. We have learned to 
practice the phenomenological attitude; we have removed a number 
of confusing methodological objections; we have defended the legiti­
macy of a pure description: the field of research lies open. But we do 
not yet know what the major themes are in <that field>; more particular­
ly, what fundamental lines of description are prescribed by the most universal 
essential species of mental processes. To produce clarity in these con­
nections, in the following chapters we shall attem pt to characterize <144) 
just these most universal essential species, at least with respect to 
some especially important traits.
With these new considerations we are not actually forsaking the 
problem of method. O ur discussions of method up to the present were 
already determined by the most universal insights into the essence of 
the phenomenological sphere. It is obvious that a more penetrating 
knowledge of the latter — not with respect to its single particulars but 
with respect to the all-prevasive universalities — must also put into 
our hands norms of method which have a richer content and which 
are, at the same time, norms with which all specific methods must 
square. A method, after all, is nothing which is, or which can be, 
brought in from outside. Rather than a method, formal logic and 
formal noetics provide only the form of a possible method; and useful 
as a knowledge of form may be methodologically, a determinate me­
thod — determined not with respect to its technical particularity but 
with respect to the universal type of method <to which it belongs> — is 
a norm which arises from the fundamental regional specificity and 
the universal structures of the province in question, so that a cogni­
tive seizing upon such a method depends essentially on knowledge of 
these structures.

§77. Reflection as a Fundamental Peculiarity of the Sphere of Mental Proces­
ses. Studies in Reflection.
Among the most universal essential peculiarities of the sphere of pure 
mental processes we shall deal with reflection first. We shall do so 
because ofits universal methodological function: the phenomenologi­
cal method operates exclusively in acts of reflection. But concerning 
the efficacy of reflection and therefore the possibility of any pheno­
menology whatever there exist skeptical doubts which we wish to 
remove completely at the outset.
Already in our preliminary deliberations we had to speak of 
reflection.2 The results which we achieved there, even before enter­
ing the field of phenomenology, we can still take over now while 
rigorously effecting the phenomenological reduction, since those 
findings concerned only what is essentially peculiar to mental proces­
ses, thus, as we know, what need only be transcendentally purified 
with respect to the formulation placed upon them in order for us to 
retain them as a secure possession. First of all we shall recapitulate 
what is already familiar and attem pt at the same time to penetrate 
more deeply into the subject-matter as well as into the nature of the 
phenomenological studies made possible and demanded by reflect­
ion.
<145) 
Each Ego is living its mental processes, and in the latter a great 
variety is included really-inherently and intentively.3 It lives them: 
that is not to say that it has them and <has> its “eye on” what they 
include and is seizing upon them in the m anner characteristic of an 
experiencing of something immanent or of any other intuiting and 
objectivating of something immanent. Any mental process which is 
not an object of regard can, with respect to ideal possibility, become 
“ regarded;” a reflection on the part of the Ego is directed to it, it now 
becomes an object for the Ego. The situation is the same in the case of 
possible Ego-regards directed to the components of the mental pro­
cess and to its intentionalities (to that of which the mental process may 
be a consciousness). In turn, the reflections are mental processes and, 
as reflections, can become the substrates of new reflections; and so on 
ad infinitum as a m atter of essentially necessary universality.
2 a u t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : Cf. above, §38, pp. 65f., and §45, p. 83.
'Marginal note in Copy A: It is always better not to refer to the plurality of Egos, moreover, and 
could give rise to unnecessary doubt.

When the mental process which, at any particular time, is actually 
being lived comes into reflective regard it becomes given as actually 
being lived, as existing “now.” But not only that: it becomes given as 
having just now been and, in so far as it was unregarded, precisely as 
having been unregarded, as not having been reflected on. In the 
natural attitude, without our thinking about it, we take it for 
granted that mental processes do not exist only when we advert to 
them and seize upon them in an experience of something immanent; 
and we also take it for granted that they actually existed and, indeed, 
were actually lived by us if they are still, in reflection on something 
immanent, within retention (“prim ary” memory) as having been 
“just now,” “still intended to.” .
We are convinced moreover that reflection on the basis of and “in” 
recollection gives us cognizance of our earlier mental processes, the 
ones which were present “then,” which were then perceivable, 
though not perceived, as something immanent.4 According to the 
naively natural view the very same holds with respect to anticipa­
tion, to forward-looking expectation. The first thing to be considered 
in that connection is immediate “protention” (as we might say), the 
precise counterpart of immediate retention; and then, presentiating 
in a quite different way, the anticipation which is, in more proper 
sense, reproductive and is the counterpart of recollection [Wiederc rin- 
nerung]. <ln such anticipation> the intuitively expected, that to 
which one intends in foresight as “coming in the future,” has at the 
same time, owing to possible reflection “in” anticipation, the signifi­
cation of some thing which will be perceived; just as the retrospective­
ly remembered has the signification of something which was percei­
ved. Thus we can reflect in anticipation too, and become aware of 
mental processes of our own upon which we were not focused in it, as 
processes belonging to the anticipated as such: as we do whenever we 
say that we shall see what is coming, our reflective regard on such <146) 
occasions adverting to the “future” mental processes of perception.
We make all that clear to ourselves in the natural attitude, perhaps 
as psychologists, and we trace the broader contexts in which the 
phenomena are involved.
If we now effect the phenomenological5 reduction, our findings 
(inside their parentheses) change into exemplificatory cases of eidetic
4 Marginal note in Copy A: Reflection in memory (also p. 148).
5 Insertion in Copy D: and eidetic

universalities which we can appropriate and systematically study 
within the limits of pure intuition. For example, in a living intuition 
(which even may be imaginary) we put ourselves into the effecting of 
some act or other, perhaps into a rejoicing at a course of theoretical 
thought which goes on freely and fruitfully. We effect all the reduct­
ions and see what lies in the pure essence of the phenomenological 
matters here. First of all, then, a being adverted to the thought which 
are going on. We develop the exemplificatory phenomenon still 
further: During the pleasing course of thoughts a reflective regard 
becomes adverted to the rejoicing. The latter becomes a mental 
process regarded and perceived as something immanent, fluctuating 
and fading away thus and so as it is regarded reflectively. At the same 
time, the freedom of the course of thought suffers; we are now 
conscious of it in a modified manner; the pleasingness belonging to its 
continuance is also affected essentially — that too we can observe by 
adverting our <reflective> regard in yet other directions. But let us 
leave this out of considerations now and take note of the following.
The first reflection on the rejoicing finds it as actually present now, 
but not as only now beginning. It is there as continuing to endure, as already 
lived before, only not looked at. That is, there evidently exists the 
possibility of tracing the past duration and mode of givenness of what 
is pleasing, of paying attention to earlier phases in the course of the 
theoretical course of thought and also to the regard which was 
previously directed to it; on the other hand, there exists the possibili­
ty of paying attention to the rejoicing advertence to it and, by 
contrast, to seize upon the lack of a regard adverted to it in the 
phenomenon which has run its course. But also, with respect to the 
rejoicing which has subsequently become an object, we have the 
possibility of effecting a reflection on the reflection which objec- 
tivates the latter and of thus making even more effectively clear the 
difference between a rejoicing which is lived, but not regarded, and a 
regarded rejoicing; likewise the modifications which are introduced by 
the acts of seizing-upon. explicating, etc., which start with the 
advertence of regard.
<147) 
All that we can consider in the phenomenological attitude and 
eidetically, either in its higher universality or with respect to whatever 
may come to light essentially in the case of particular kinds of mental 
processes. The entire stream of mental processes, with the lived 
processes which, in the mode of consciousness as not modified reflectionally} 
belong to it, can thus be submitted to a scientific eidetic study aiming

at systematic completeness and, more particularly, with respect also to 
all the possibilities of mental process-moments intentively contained 
in them and therefore specifically with respect to the mental proces­
ses which are perhaps intended to in them in a modified manner and 
to the intentionalia of these processes. We have already become 
acquainted with examples of the latter in the form of those modifica­
tions of mental processes which are intentively included in all presen- 
tiations and can be singled out by reflection “in” presentations: for 
example, the “was-perceived” which is contained in any memory 
and the “will-be-perceived” contained in every expectation.
The study of the stream of mental processes is, for its part, carried 
on in variety of peculiarly structured reflective acts which themselves 
also belong in the stream of mental processes and which, in corres­
ponding reflections at a higher level, can be made the Objects of 
phenomenological analyses. This is because their analysis is funda­
mental to a universal phenomenology and to the methodological 
insight quite indispensible to it. Something similar is obviously true 
in the case of psychology. By vague references to a study of mental 
processes in reflection or in memory — which people usually identify 
with reflection — nothing is accomplished, apart from many a falsity 
which is frequently combined directly with such references (precisely 
because of the lack of serious eidetic analysis) such as, e.g., that there 
can be no such thing at all as perception and observation of some­
thing immanent.
Let us enter somewhat more closely into these matters.
§78. The Phenomenological Study of Reflections on Mental Processes.
According to what has just been explained, reflection is a name for 
acts in which the stream of mental processes, with all its manifold 
occurrences (mental process-moments, intentionalia) become evi­
dentially apprehensible and analyzable. It is, as we can also say, the 
name of the method of consciousness leading to the cognition of any 
consciousness whatever. By this very method, however, it itself be­
comes an Object of possible studies: Reflection is also the name for 
kinds of mental processes which belong essentially together and is 
therefore the theme of a main chapter of phenomenology. The task of < 148) 
that chapter is to distinguish the different “ reflections” and analyze 
them all in a systematic order.

In this connection, first of all, one must make it clear that “reflect­
ion” of any kind has the characteristic of being a modification of a 
consciousness and, moreover, a modification which essentially any 
consciousness can undergo.
We speak here of modification because any reflection is, according 
to its essence, the consequence of changes in attitude whereby an 
already given mental process or really immanental Datum thereof 
(one not modified reflectionally) undergoes a certain transmutation 
precisely into the mode of consciousness (or object of consciousness) 
reflectionally modified. The already given mental process can itself 
already have the characteristic of reflectionally modified conscious­
ness of something, so that the new modification belongs to a higher 
level; but ultimately we get back to mental processes which are 
absolutely unmodified reflectionally, and to the really inherent and 
the intentive dabile belonging to them. Now, according to an eidetic 
law, any mental process can become converted into reflectional 
modifications, and <can be converted) along different lines with 
which we shall become more precisely acquainted.
The fundamental methodological significance of the eidetic study 
of the reflections for phenomenology and, no less, for psychology, is 
shown by the fact that under reflection all modes of the seizing upon 
the essence of something immanent and, on the other hand, of 
experiencing something immanent, are included. Included therefore 
is, e.g., perception of something immanent which is, in fact, a reflecti­
on in so far as it presupposes a turning of one’s regard from something 
else of which one was conscious to the consciousness of that some­
thing. In like manner, as we mentioned (in the last section) when 
discussing the taken-for-granted features of the natural attitude, any 
memory admits not only of a reflective turning of one’s regard to it 
itself but also of the peculiar modification of reflection “in” memory. 
In memory there is at first, perhaps, consciousness of, e.g., the course 
of a piece of music unmodified reflectionally in the mode of the “past. ” 
But there belongs to the essence of the object of such a consciousness 
the possibility of reflecting on the having-been-perceived of that 
object. There likewise exists for expectation, for consciousness foresee­
ing “what is coming,” the eidetic possibility of turning one’s regard 
away from what is coming to its having-become-perceived. Inherent 
in these eidetic connections is the fact that the statements, “ I remem­
ber A” and “ I have perceived A,” “ I foresee A” and “ I will perceive 
A,” are a priori and immediately equivalent — but they are only 
equivalent since the sense is different in each case.

Here the phenomenological task is to investigate systematically all < 149) 
the modifications of mental processes falling under the heading of 
reflection, in connection with all the modifications to which they are 
essentially related and which they presuppose. The latter concerns the 
totality of essential modifications which any mental process must 
undergo during its originary course and, in addition, the different 
kinds of variations which can be conceived idealiter as effected on 
each mental process by means of “operations.”
In itself every mental process is a flux of becoming, is what it is in a 
generation originaliter of an invariant essential type; it is a continuous 
flow of retentions and protentions mediated by a flowing phase of 
originarity itself in which there is consciousness of the living now of 
the mental process in contradistinction to its “ before” and “after.”6 
On the other hand, every mental process has its parallel in the 
different forms of reproductions which can be regarded as ideally 
inherent “operative” transformations of the original mental process: 
each has its “precisely corresponding” and yet thoroughly modified 
counterpart in a recollection, likewise in a possible anticipation, in a 
possible mere7 phantasy and, again, in the reiterations of such 
variations.
Naturally we conceive all the parallelized mental processes as 
parallelized processes of a common essential composition: the paral­
lel mental processes should therefore intend to the same intentional 
objectivities, and intend to them in identical modes of givenness by 
virtue of the range of all those which, in other respects of possible 
variation, can take place.
Because the8 modifications under consideration belong to any 
mental process as ideally inherent possible variations, thus to a 
certain extent designating operations idealiter which can be thought 
of as effected on any <mental process>, they are reiterable ad infinitum, 
they are also to be effected on the modified mental processes. Conver­
sely, starting from any mental process already characterized as such 
a modification, and which then in itself is always characterized as that 
<modification>, we are led back to certain primal mental processes, to 
“impressions99 which absolutely originary mental processes exhibit in the 
phenomenological sense. Thus perceptions of physical things are origi­
nary mental processes in relation to all rememberings, presentiations

in phantasy; and so forth. They are therefore as originary as concrete 
mental processes can be universally. This is because they have in
< 150) their concretion, more precisely considered, only one, but also always 
a continuously flowing, absolutely originary phase — the moment of the 
living now.
We can relate these modifications primarily to the actionally 
conscious mental processes not reflectionally modified, since we can 
see at once that everything intended to in reflectionally modified 
consciousness eo ipso must acquire a share in these primary modifica­
tions by the fact that they, as reflections on mental processes and taken in 
full concretion, are themselves conscious mental processes not reflec­
tionally modified and as not so modified take on all modifications. 
Now, reflection is certainly itself a new kind of universal modification
— this directing itself to mental processes pertaining to the Ego and in 
unity with the effecting of acts of the cogito (particularly of acts 
belonging to the lowest, fundamental stratum, that of presentation 
simpliciter) “in” which the Ego directs itself to its mental processes; but 
just the combining of reflection with intuitive or empty apprehen­
sions or seizing-upon conditions the necessary combining of the study 
of the reflectional modifications with that of the modifications indi­
cated above.
By the reflectional experiencing acts alone we know something of the 
stream of mental processes and of the necessary relatedness of the 
<stream> to the pure Ego; thus we know that it is a field of free 
effectings of cogitationes belonging to one and the same pure Ego; 
that all mental processes of the stream are the Ego’s precisely in so far 
as it regards or can direct its regard “ through” <the stream> to 
something other than the Ego. We are convinced that these experienc- 
ings also preserve their sense and legitimacy as reduced <experienc- 
ings>, and in generical eidetic universality we seize upon the legitima­
cy of any experiencings of such a characteristic, just as, in a way 
parallel with that, we seize upon the legitimacy of seeing an essence 
related to any mental process whatever.
Thus, e.g., we seize upon the absolute legitimacy of reflection on 
preceiving something immanent, i.e., perception simpliciter of some­
thing immanent9 and, more particularly, with respect to what, in its 
flowing away, it actually makes given originarily; similarly, the 
absolute legitimacy of retention of something immanent with respect to what

is intended to in it in the characteristic of what is “still” living and 
what has “just now” been, but of course only so far as the content of 
what is thus characterized reaches. Thus, e.g., in view of the fact that 
it was the perceiving of a tone and not of a color. We likewise seize 
upon the relative legitimacy of recollection of something immanent 
which reaches so far as the content of this remembering, singly 
regarded, shows the genuine recollection-characteristic (which, uni­
versally, by no means is done by each moment remembered) — a 
legitimacy which occurs entirely in any recollection. But, of course, it 
is merely a “relative” <legitimacy>, one which can be outweighed no 
matter to what extent it is still a legitimacy. And so forth.
As a consequence, we see with the most perfect clarity and with the 
consciousness of unconditioned validity that it would be countersens- 
ical to mean that mental processes would be cognitionally assured 
only to the extent that they are given in the reflectional consciousness 
pertaining to the perceiving of something immanent; or even that 
they would only be assured in the particular actual Now; that it 
would be wrong to doubt the having existed of what, in the turning 
back of the regard, is found as “still” intended to (the immediate 
retention); and, again, <it is wrong> finally to doubt whether mental 
processes which become the object of a regard are not, as a conse­
quence, converted toto coelo into something different; and so forth. 
It is only necessary here not to let oneself be confused by arguments 
which, in all formal precision, allow that conformity to the primal 
source, to that of pure intuition, be confounded; it is necessary to 
remain faithful to the “principle of all principles” that perfect clarity 
is the measure of all truth, and that statements which faithfully 
express their data need not be concerned about arguments, no 
matter how refined they may yet be.
§79. Critical Excursis. Phenomenology and the Difficulties of 
“ Self-observation. ”
From what has just been set forth we can see that phenomenology is 
not affected by that methodological skepticism which in empirical 
psychology has, in parellel cases, so frequently led to the denial or the 
improper limitation of the value of experience of something internal. 
Recently H.J. W att10 has, nevertheless, believed that this skepticism
<151)

can be advocated against phenomenology whereby he certainly has 
not seized the sense peculiar to pure phenomenology which the 
Logische Untersuchungen tried to introduce; nor has he seen the differ­
ence between pure phenomenological matters and empirical psycho­
logical ones. No m atter how closely akin the difficulties of both sides 
<152) are, there is still a difference between whether we ask, <on the one 
hand>, about the range and the essentially necessary cognitive value 
of existential findings which give expression to the givennesses of our 
(human) experiences of the internal — we therefore ask about 
psychological method; or if we ask, on the other hand, about the 
phenomenological method, about the essentially necessary possibili­
ty and range of essential findings which, on the ground of pure 
reflection, should concern mental processes as mental processes with 
respect to their own being free from natural apperception. Neverthe­
less, between both <methods> there subsist inner relationships, indeed 
in an appreciable measure congruences, which justify our taking into 
consideration W att’s objections, in particularly significant state­
ments such as the following:
“One can indeed scarcely even inquire into the likelihood of how 
one arrives at the cognition of immediate mental living. For it is 
neither knowledge nor the object of knowledge; it is rather something 
else. It is not to be discerned how a report about the mental living of 
mental living, even when it is there, could be put down on paper.” 
“But this is always the ultimate question of the fundamental problem 
of self-observation.” “Today one designates this absolute description 
as phenomenology.”11
Reviewing the work of Th. Lipps, W att then further states: “The 
known I gewufiten ] actuality of objects of self-observation stands over 
against the actuality of the present Ego and the present 
consciousness-processes. This actuality is mentally lived [namely, me­
rely lived, not ’known,’ i.e., not seized upon reflectively]. It is there­
fore precisely absolute actuality.” “One may now be of a very dif­
ferent conviction,” he now adds for his part, “about what one can do

J. Watt polemicizes exclusively against Th. Lipps. Although my name is not mentioned in that 
connection, I still believe that his critique must be regarded as also directed against me since a 
large part of his exposition of the literature could just as well be related to my Logische 
Untersuchungen (1900/01) as to the later writings ofTh. Lipps.
11 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : Ibid., p. 5.

with this absolute actuality... Moreover, it is a matter here only of the 
results of self-observation. When, now, this ever retrospective obser­
vation is always knowledge about mental processes just had as objects, 
how can one establish the states of which one has no knowledge, of 
which there is only consciousness? Indeed, it all turns on the impor­
tance of the whole discussion of, namely, the derivation of the concept 
of immediate mental living which is not knowledge. One must be able 
to observe. Finally, each of us lives mentally. Only he does not know it.
And if he were to know it, how can he know that his mental living is in 
actuality absolutely thus as he thinks it is? From whose head does <153) 
phenomenology spring fully armed? Is a phenomenology possible and 
in which sense? All of these questions thrust themselves to the fore. 
Perhaps a discussion of the question of selfobservation by experimen­
tal psychology will shed new light on this domain. For the problem of 
phenomenology is one which also necessarily arises for experimental 
psychology. Perhaps the latter’s answer will also be more careful since 
it lacks the zeal of the discoverer of phenomenology. In any case, it is, 
by virtue of itself, referred more to an inductive method.” 12
With the pious belief in the omnipotence of the inductive13 m eth­
od referred to in the last lines (and which W att would scarcely be able 
to m aintain if he were to reflect on the conditions for the possibility of 
this method), it is certainly surprising to find the admission “that a 
functional-analytic psychology will never be able to explain the facts 
of knowledge.”14
In contrast to these statements characteristic of recent psychology
— precisely in so far as they are meant psychologically — we must 
bring to light, in the first place, the separation made above between 
psychological and phenomenological questions and, in this respect 
emphasize the fact that a phenomenological doctrine of essences is of 
no more interest to the method by which the phenomenologist can 
make sure of the existence of those mental processes which serve him as 
foundations for his phenomenological findings than the geometer 
would be interested in how the existence of figures on the board or the 
models on the shelf could be methodologically established. As sciences 
of pure essence, geometry and phenomenology do not recognize any 
findings about real existence. Connected with just that is the fact
12 a u t h o r s’s f o o t n o t e : Ibid., p. 7.
13 Insertion in Copy A: and hence indirect
14 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : Ibid., p. 12.

that clear feignings not only offer them foundations as good as, but 
to a great extent better than, the data of actual perception and 
experience.15
If, now, phenomenology does not, as a consequence, have to make 
existential findings about mental processes, if it thus need not make 
“experiences” and “observations” in the natural sense, in the sense in 
which a science of matters of fact must support itself by them, it 
nevertheless makes eidetic findings about reflectionally unmodified 
mental processes as the essentially necessary condition ofits possibili­
ty. But it owes this to reflection, more precisely to reflectional intui- 
<154) tion of essences. As a result, the skeptical doubt with respect to self­
observation likewise comes into view for phenomenology; it comes 
into view for phenomenology, more particularly, in so far as this 
doubt allows of being extended in an obvious way from reflection on 
something immanent to reflection taken universally.
As a m atter of fact, what should phenomenology become if it 
“were not to be seen how a report about the mental living of mental 
living, even when it is there, could be put down on paper”? W hat 
should be made of phenomenology if it could make statements about 
the essence of “known,” reflectionally modified mental processes but 
not about mental processes pure and simple? W hat should it be if 
“one can scarcely even inquire into the likelihood of how one arrives 
at cognition of immediate mental living?” — or, to cognition ofits 
essence? It may be that phenomenology cannot produce any existen­
tial findings in relation to the mental processes which hover before it 
as examples for its ideation. Yet in these ideations it only sees, one can 
object, ideas of just what it has before its eyes at the moment in the 
examples. As soon as its regard adverts to the mental process, it only 
adverts to what is now presented to the regard, just as when it turns 
away the regard it adverts to a different <mental process>. The essence 
seized upon is only the essence of the reflectionally modified mental 
process; and the conviction proves to be completely ungrounded that 
by reflection we can acquire absolutely valid cognitions true for any 
mental process whatever, be it reflectionally modified or not. “How 
can one establish states,” even as essential possibilities, “of which one 
can have no knowledge?”
That obviously concerns every kind of reflection, although in 
phenomenology each of them still holds as the source of absolute

cognitions. In phantasy a physical thing, be it even a centaur, hovers 
before me. I mean to know that it is presented in certain “modes of 
appearance,” in certain “adumbrations of sensations,” apprehen­
sions, and so forth. I mean to have there the eidetic insight that such an 
object taken universally can only be intuited in that kind of modes of 
appearance only by means of such and such adumbrational functions 
and whatever else might play a role here. But having my eye on the 
centaur, I do not regard its modes of appearance, adumbrative Data, 
apprehensions; and seizing upon its essence, I do not seize upon those 
modes of appearance, Data and apprehensions and their essence. A 
certain reflective turning of the regard to them is necessary, but 
which modifies and brings the whole mental process into flux; and in 
the new <act of> ideation I therefore have my eye on something new 
and need not assert that I have acquired the eidetic components of 
the reflectionally unmodified mental process. Nor need I assert that it <155) 
pertains to the essence of a physical thing as physical to be presented 
in “appearances,” to be adumbrated by Data of sensation of the kind 
indicated which, on their side, undergo apprehensions, etc.
Obviously the difficulty also concerns analyses of consciousness 
with respect to the “sense” of intentive mental processes, with respect 
to everything which belongs to what is meant, to what is intentional­
ly objective as intentional, to the sense of a statement; and the like.
For that too is analysis within the relevantly directed reflections.
W att himself even goes so far as to say that “psychology must make it 
clear that in the case of self-observation the relation to something 
objective pertaining to the mental processes to be described changes. 
Perhaps this change has a much greater signification than one is 
inclined to believe.”16 If W att is right, then we would, as a conse­
quence, be asserting too much by claiming in self-observation that 
we were just now attentive to this book here and were still attentive to 
it. At best that holds prior to reflection. But reflection changed “ the 
mental process to be described” pertaining to attention and, more 
particularly (according to W att), with respect to the relation to 
something objective.
All genuine skepticism of whatever kind and persuasion is indica­
ted by the essentially necessary countersense that, in its argum enta­
tions, it implicitly presupposes as conditions of the possibility of its 
validity precisely what it denies in its theses. W ithout difficulty one

can persuade himself that this feature is equally true of the argumen­
tations under discussion. He who also says: I doubt the cognitive 
signification of reflection, asserts a countersense. For as he declares 
his doubt, he reflects, and setting down this statement as valid 
presupposes that reflection actually and without doubt (scl. for the 
cases present) has the cognitive value doubted, that it does not change 
the relation to something objective, that the reflectionally unmodi­
fied mental process does not forfeit its essence in the transition to 
reflection.
Furthermore: The argumentations continuously speak of reflec­
tion as a m atter of fact and of that which it encumbers and can 
encumber; as a consequence, one also speaks, naturally, of the 
“unknown,” reflectionally unmodified mental processes as, again, 
matters of fact, namely as those on the basis of which the reflectional­
ly modified processes arise. Therefore a knowledge of reflectionally 
unmodified mental processes, among them reflectionally unmodified 
reflections, is continuously presupposed, while at the same time the 
possibility of that knowledge is placed in question. This occurs in so 
<156) far as there is doubt concerning the possibility of claiming anything 
whatever about the content of the reflectionally unmodified mental 
process and about the production of reflection: to what extent does it 
change the original mental process, and does it falsify it, so to speak, 
making it a totally different <mental process>?
However, it is clear that if this doubt and the possibility posited in 
it were legitimate, there would not remain the slightest ground of 
justification for the certainty that a reflectionally unmodified mental 
process and a reflection are given and can be given at all. It is clear, 
moreover, that the <certainty> which indeed was the continual pre­
supposition can only be known by reflection, and that it can only be 
legitimated as immediate knowledge by a reflectionally presentive 
intuition. The case is the same with respect to the assertions of the 
actuality or the possibility of modifications which subsequently came 
by reflection. But if the like is given by intuition, then it is given in an 
intuitional content; it is therefore countersensical to assert that there 
is here nothing cognizable, nothing with respect to the content of the 
reflectionally unmodified mental process and the kind of modifica­
tions which it undergoes.
All that is sufficient to make the countersense distinct. Here, as 
everywhere, the skepticism loses its force by going back from verbal 
argumentations to eidetic intuition, to originarily presentive intui-

tion and the legitimacy primally its own. O f course, everything 
depends on one also actually effecting it and being capable of raising 
what is in question into the light of genuine eidetic clarity or presen­
tations, as we have tried to do in the previous paragraphs — thus 
taking them up in the same intuitive way in which they have been 
effected and offered.
The phenomena of reflection are, in fact, a sphere of pure and 
possibly perfectly clear data. It is an eidetic insight, always attainable 
because immediate, that starting from the objectively given as objec­
tive reflection on the presentive consciousness and its subject is 
always possible: starting from the perceived, from what is “there ‘in 
person’,’’ a reflection on the perceiving; starting from the remember­
ed, just as it “hovers before us” as remembered, as “having been,” a 
reflection on the remembering; starting from the statement in the 
flowing off of its being given, a reflection on the stating, etc. As a 
consequence, the perceiving becomes given as the perceiving of just 
this perceived, the present consciousness becomes given as conscious­
ness ofsomething intended to. 11 is evident that by virtue ofits essence
— thus not for adventitious reasons, perchance merely “for us” and 
our adventitious “psychological constitution” — something such as <157) 
consciousness and consciousness-content (in the sense of what is 
really inherent or intentional) is cognizable by reflection. God is also 
bound to this absolute necessity given in insight, just as He is to 
discerning that 2 + 1 = 1 + 2. Even God can only acquire cognition 
of His consciousness and consciousness-content by reflection.17
In that connection, it is said at the same time that with the ideal of 
perfect cognition reflection cannot be implicated in any antinomian 
controversy. We have had to emphasize many times that each species 
of being has, owing to its essence, its modes of givenness and with that 
its own cognitive method. It is countersensical to treat their essential 
peculiarities as deficiencies, let alone to count them among the sort of 
adventitious, factual deficiencies pertaining to “our hum an” cog­
nition. Another question, but likewise to be considered in eidetic 
insight, is, however, that about the possible “ range” of the cognition 
in question; it is thus the question about how we are to protect 
ourselves from statements which go beyond what is actually given at
17 
a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : We do not extend the controversy here to the domain of theology. The 
idea of God is a necessary limiting concept in epistemological considerations, and an in­
dispensable index to the construction of certain limiting concepts which not even the philosophiz­
ing atheist can do without.

the moment and which is to be seized upon eidetically. And still 
another question concerns the empirical methods: how do we human 
beings have to proceed, for instance as psychologists, under given 
psychological circumstances in order to confer upon our human 
cognitions the highest dignity possible.
In addition, we must emphasize that our repeated recourse to 
insight (evidence or intuition) is not to mere rhetoric here or any­
where else; in the sense of the introductory part, the regress to what is 
ultimate in cognition signifies, instead, precisely the same thing when 
the word insight is used in the most primitive logical and arithmetical 
axioms.18 But he who has learned to apprehend with insight what is 
<158) given in the sphere of consciousness will be able to read with astonish­
ment statements such as the ones cited above: “One cannot even 
inquire into the likelihood of how one arrives at the cognition of 
immediate mental living;55 from this we can see how alien the eidetic 
analysis of the immanent still is to modern psychology, even though 
<eidetic analysis) is the uniquely possible method for fixing the con­
cepts which have to function as determinative in all psychological 
description of what is immanent.19,20
18 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : While this book was in press I read in thejust published Erkenntnistheorie 
aufpsychophysiologischer undphysikalischen Grundlage [ Theory ofKnowledge on the Grounds of Psychophysi­
ology and Physics] <(Jena, 1912)> by Theodor Ziehen a characteristic utterance about “that 
suspicious, so-called intuition or evidence ... which has two principal properties: first of all, it 
varies from one philosophical school to another; and, secondly, it has a special preference for 
occurring just when the author renders an especially doubtful point of his theory. We are then to protect 
ourselves from doubt by bluff.” As the context reveals, this critique is concerned with the theory of 
“universal objects” or “essence” and intuition of essence which is worked out in the Logische 
Untersuchungen. Thus Ziehen further states: “ In order to distinguish these supra-empirical 
concepts from the common herd of ordinary concepts, one often has even ascribed to them in 
addition a particular universality, an absolute exactitude, and the like. I takeall this to be human 
arrogance.” [Ibid., p. 413) No less characteristic for this theory of knowledge is the utterance on p. 
441 related to the intuitiveseizingupon the Ego (but in theauthor’ssense having a quite universal 
validity): “I can conceive ofonly oneactual testimony forsuch a primary intuition: the agreement 
of all sentient and thinking individuals in witnessingsuch an intuition.” — Certainly it cannot be 
denied that excesses have often been committed by appealing to ‘ ‘intuition.” Theonly question is 
whether or not this excess with an alleged intuition can be discovered any other way than by an 
actual intuition. Even in the sphere of experience many excesses are committed in the appeal to 
experience, and it would be hard to accept if one were, on that account, to designate experience 
taken universally as “bluff,” and its “testimony” made to depend on the “agreement of all 
sentient and thinking individuals in the witnessing of such ‘experience’.” [Addition to this sentence

The intimate connection between phenomenology and psycholo­
gy is especially tangible in the problems of reflection dealt with here.
Every description of essence related to species of mental processes 
expresses an unconditionally valid norm for possible empirical exis­
tence. In particular, this naturally concerns as well all the species of 
mental processes which are themselves constitutive for the psycholog­
ical method, just as that <method> holds for all modes of experience 
of the internal. Thus phenomenology is the court of appeal for <159) 
methodologically basic questions of psychology. Psychology must 
recognize, and if need be, rely on, what it has established generically 
as the condition for the possibility of all its further methods. W hat 
proves to be contradictory in that connection characterizes an essenti­
ally necessary psychological countersense in precisely the same way that, in 
the physical sphere, whatever contradicts the truths of geometry and 
the ontology of Nature taken universally is the essentially necessary 
countersense of the natural sciences.
One such essentially necessary countersense is expressed, accor­
dingly, in the hope of overcoming the skeptical doubts about the 
possibility of self-observation by psychological induction in the ways of 
experimental psychology. Again, it is like the case in the domain of 
the cognition of physical nature where one would overcome by experi- 
mental physics the parallel skepticism about whether it is not the case 
that ultimately every perception of something external is deceptive 
(since, indeed, taken singly, each actual perception can deceive) 
when in fact the legitimacy of perception of something external is 
presupposed at every step.
Moreover, what is said here in universality will gain in force by 
everything which follows, in particular by the clarifications of the 
range of reflectional eidetic insights. The relations touched upon here 
between phenomenology (or between eidetic psychology, which has 
not even been separated form phenomenology in a preliminary way,
c ame to me while this book was in press, shows again how little even significant investigators have 
succeeded in freeing themselves from the bonds of the dominant prejudices and, while 
sympathetic to the efforts of phenomenology, how little they have succeeded in apprehending the 
own specific characteristics of phenomenology as a “ theory of essence ” Both, and especially Messer 
(even in his earlier <( 1912)> critical statements in Archivf d. ges. Psychol., Vol. X X II / ‘Husserls 
Phanomenologie in ihrem Verhaltnis zur Psychologie” [“Husserl’s Phenomenology in its 
Relationship to Psychol ogy” ]>), have misunderstood the^^w^ofmy presentations and to such an 
extent that the theories against which they argue there as mine, areinno way mine at all. It is my hope 
that the detailed expositions of the present work will not allow misunderstandings of this sort to 
arise again.

and which in any case is intimately tied up with phenomenology) 
and psychology as an experiential science will also be subject to 
clarification in the Second Book with all the profound problems 
pertaining to it I am certain that in the not too distant future it will be 
a common conviction that phenomenology (or eidetic psychology) 
will be the methodologically foundational science for empirical psy­
chology in the same sense that the material mathematical disciplines 
(e.g., geometry and phoronomy) are foundational for physics.
The old ontological doctrine that the cognition of “possibilities” must 
precede the cognition of actualities is, in my opinion, in so far as it is 
correctly understood and made useful in the right ways, a great 
truth.
§80. The Relationship of Mental Processes to the Pure Ego.
Among the universal essential peculiarities pertaining to the trans- 
cendentally purified realm of mental processes the first place is due 
the relationship of each mental process to the “pure” Ego. Each
< 160) “cogito,” each act in a distinctive sense, is characterized as an act of 
the Ego, it “proceeds from out of the Ego,” it “lives” “actionally” in 
the act. We have already spoken about this and will recall in a few 
sentences what was previously elaborated.
While observing, /  perceive something; in a like manner /a m  often 
“ busied” with something in memory; while quasi-observing, /follow 
in inventive phantasy what goes on in the phantasied world. O r I 
reflect, I draw conclusions; I take back a judgment, perchance 
“abstaining” from making any judgments at all. I am pleased or 
displeased, I am glad or sad, I wish, or I will and I do<something>; o r, 
again, I “abstain” from being glad, from wishing, willing and doing. 
In all such acts I am present, I am actionally there. Upon reflecting, I 
apprehend myself as the human being who is there.
But if I effect the phenomenological £tcoxt), then, as in the case of 
the whole world in the natural positing, there “ I, the human being” 
undergoes exclusion; what remains behind is the pure act-process 
with its own essence. However, I also see that the apprehension of 
<that process> as human mental process, apart from the positing of 
existence, brings in a variety of things which need not of necessity be 
there21 and that, <on the other hand, no> excluding can annul the

form of cogito and cancel out the “ pure” subject of the act: the “ being 
directed to,” the “being busied with,” the “ taking a position to­
ward,” the “undergoing,” the “suffering from,” necessarily includes in 
its essence this: that it is precisely <a ray> “ emanating from the Ego” 
or, in a reverse direction of the ray, “ toward the Ego” — and this Ego 
is the pure Ego; no reduction can do anything to it.
We spoke before of mental processes of the particular type “cogi­
to.” The other mental processes, which form the universal milieu for 
the Ego-actionality, to be sure, lack the distinctive Ego-relatedness 
which we have just mentioned. And yet they also have their share in 
the pure Ego and the pure Ego has its share in them. They “belong” 
to <the pure Ego> as “its own” <mental processes,> they are its 
consciousness-background, its field of freedom.
In these peculiar combinations with all of “ its” mental processes, 
the Ego living in mental processes [<das erlebende Ick\ is not something 
taken for itself and which can be made into an Object proper of an 
investigation. Aside from its “modes of relation” or “modes of com­
portm ent,” the <Ego> is completely empty of essence-components, 
has no explicatable content, is undescribable in and for itself: it is 
pure Ego and nothing more.22
For this reason there is still the occasion for a multiplicity of 
important descriptions precisely with respect to the particualr ways 
in which it is an Ego living in the kinds of mental processes or modes of 
mental processes in question. Accordingly, there are always distin­
guished — in spite of the necessary relatedness to one another — the 
mental process itself and the pure Ego pertaining to the mental living. 
And, again: <there are always distinguished) the purely subjective mo­
ments of the mode of consciousness and, so to speak, the rest of the content of 
the mental process turned away from the Ego. As a consequence, there is a 
certain, extraordinarily important two-sidedness in the essence of the 
sphere of mental processes, of which we can also say that in mental 
processes there is to be distinguished a subjectively orientedI23 side and 
an objectively oriented side: a manner of expression which must not be 
understood, indeed, as if we taught that the “Object” of the mental 
processes were something in it analogous to the pure Ego. The 
manner of expression will nevertheless be justified. And we add at 
once that to this two-sidedness, at least in significant stretches, there

corresponds a division of the investigation (if not an actual separa­
tion), one part of which is oriented toward pure subjectivity, the 
other part toward what belongs to the “constitution” of Objectivity 
for the subjectivity. We shall have a great deal to say about the 
“intentional relation” of mental processes (or of the pure Ego living 
in them) to Objects, and about the many sorts of mental process- 
components and “intentional correlates” which belong together 
with <that relations But all of these can be explored and described 
analytically or synthetically in comprehensive investigations with­
out having to be occupied in any more profound way with the pure 
Ego and its modes of participation. O f course, frequently one must 
touch upon the pure Ego in so far as the pure Ego is something 
necessarily involved there.
The meditations which we intend to carry out further in this Part 
give preference to the objectively oriented side as that which offers 
itself in the first place when starting from the natural attitude. The 
problems indicated in the introductory paragraphs of this Part 
already refer to this objectively oriented side>.
§81. Phenomenological Time and Consciousness of Time.
A proper discussion is required by phenomenological time as a 
universal peculiarity of all mental processes.
W'e must carefully observe the distinction between this phenomenolog­
ical time, this unitary form of all mental processes within one stream of 
mental processes (within one pure Ego), and the “objective ” i.e., the 
cosmic time.24
<162) 
By means of the phenomenological reduction consciousness has 
not only lost25 its apperceptive “attachem ent” (which, of course, is a 
metaphor) to material reality and its incorporation into space, even 
though this is secondary, but also its place in cosmic time. That time 
which, by virtue ofits essence belongs to the mental process as mental 
process, with its modes of givenness of Now, Before, After, with their 
modally determined simultaneity and recession, etc., is not measured 
nor to be measured by any position of the sun, by any clock, by any 
physical means .
24 Marginal note to cosmic time in Copy A: cosmic can still be misleading; space-time?
25 Marginal note to lost in Copy D: lost?

Cosmic time is related to phenomenological time in a certain way 
analogous to the way in which a “spread” belonging to the imma­
nental essence of a concrete sensation-content (perhaps a visual 
sensation-content in the field of visual sensation-Data) is related to 
objective spatial “extension,” namely <the “extension’s of the ap­
pearing physical Object being visually “adum brated” in this 
sensation-Datum. Just as it would be countersensical to subordinate 
a sensation-moment, such as color or spread, under the same essent­
ial genus with the physical moment, such as the color of the physical 
thing and the physical extension, adumbrated <by the sensation- 
Datum): so the same would be the case with regard to the phenomen- 
ologically temporal and the worldly temporal. Transcendent time 
can be presented by way of appearance in the mental process and its 
components; but of essential necessity it makes no sense here as 
elsewhere to suppose a metaphorical similarity between the presen­
tation and the presented which, as similarity, would presuppose 
oneness of essence.
In addition, it should not be said, for instance, that the way in 
which cosmic time is manifested in phenomenological time is precisely 
the same way in which other, material-essential moments of the 
world are phenomenologically presented. Certainly the presenting of 
colors and other sensuous qualities of physical things (in correspon­
ding sense Data pertaining to sense-fields) is essentially different in 
kind; and, again, the adumbrating of spatial shapes of physical things 
in the forms of spread within D ata of sensation is different in kind.
But in what was worked out above commonality exists everywhere.
Moreover, as will emerge from investigations to follow later on, 
time is a name for a completely delimited sphere of problems and one of 
exceptional difficulty. It will be shown that in order to avoid confu­
sion our previous presentation has remained silent to a certain 
extent, and must of necessity remain silent about what first of all is 
alone visible in the phenomenological attitude and which, disregard­
ing the new dimension, makes up a closed domain of investigation. <163) 
The transcendentally “absolu te” which we have brought about by the 
reductions is, in truth, not what is ultimate; it is something which 
constitutes itself in a certain profound and completely peculiar sense 
ofits own and which has its primal source in what is ultimately and 
truly absolute.
Fortunately we can leave out of account the enigma of conscious-

ness of time26 in our preliminary analyses without endangering their 
rigor. In the following sentences we only touch upon it:
The essential property, which the term temporality expresses for 
any mental process whatever, not only designates something univer­
sally belonging to every single mental process, but also a necessary form 
combining mental processes with mental processesP Each actual mental 
process (we effect this evidence on the ground of clear intuition of an 
actuality characterizing mental processes) is necessarily an enduring 
one; and with this duration it finds its place in an infinite continuum 
of duration — in a fulfilled continuum. O f necessity it has an all­
round, infinitely fulfilled temporal horizon. At the same time this 
says: it belongs to one endless “stream of mental processes ” Every single 
mental process, e.g., a mental process of joy, can begin as well as end 
and hence delimit its duration. But the stream of mental processes 
cannot begin and end. Every mental process, as temporal being, is a 
mental process of its pure Ego. Belonging of necessity to this is the 
possibility (which, as we know, is no empty logical possibility) that 
the Ego directs its pure regard to this mental process and seizes upon 
<the mental process> as actually existing or as enduring in phenome­
nological time.
But, again, there belongs to the essence of the situation the possibili­
ty that the Ego directs its regard to the temporal modes of givenness and 
knows with evidence (as we all in fact acquire this evidence by 
reliving what is described in intuition) that no enduring mental 
process is possible unless it is constituted in a continuous flow of 
modes of givenness as something unitary pertaining to the event and 
to the duration; moreover, <it knows with evidence> that this mode of 
givenness of the temporal mental process is itself again a mental 
<164) process, although of a new kind and dimension. Thus, for instance, I 
can have, first of all, in the pure regard the joy itself which begins and 
ends and endures in the meantime; I go along with its temporal 
phases. However, I can take heed of its modes of givenness: I take 
heed, in the particular case, of the mode of “Now” and accordingly of 
the fact that a new and continually new <Now> follows upon this Now 
and, ofessential necessity, upon every <Now> in necessary continuity, of 
the fact that in unity therewith every actually present Now is chan-
26 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : The efforts of the author concerning this enigma, and which were in 
vain for a long time, were brought to a conclusion in 1905 with respect to what is essential; the 
results were communicated in lecturcs at the University of Gottingen.

ged into a Just Now, the Just Now once more and continuously into 
an always new Just Now of the Just Now; and so forth. This holds for 
every new ensuing Now.
The actually present Now is necessarily and remains something 
punctual, a persisting form for ever new material. It is likewise with the 
continuity of “just now;’ it is a continuity of forms of always new 
contents. At the same time this signifies: the enduring mental process 
of joy is given “in the manner peculiar to consciousness” in a 
consciousness-continuum of constant form: A phase, impression, as 
the limit-phase of a continuity of retentions which, however, are not 
on an equal footing; they are instead to be related to one another 
continuously-intentively — a continuous complexity of retentions of 
retentions. The form always contains a new content, thus continu­
ously “attaches” to each impression in which the Now of the mental 
process is given, a new <impression> corresponding continuously to a 
new point of the duration; an impression continuously changes into a 
retention; this retention continuously changes into a modified reten­
tion; and so forth.
To this must be added the counter-direction of continuous chan­
ges: to the Before there corresponds the After; to the continuum of 
retentions there corresponds that of protentions.
§82. Continuation. The Three-fold Horizon of Mental Processes As At The 
Same Time the Horizon of Reflection On Mental Processes.
But we also know still more in this connection. Each Now of the 
mental process, be it even the beginning phase of a newly appearing 
mental process, necessarily has its horizon of Before. But of essential 
necessity that cannot be an empty Before, an empty form without 
content, a non-sense. O f necessity it has the signification of a past 
Now which comprises in this form a past something, a past mental 
process. Every mental process which has newly begun is of necessity 
temporally preceded by mental processes; the past of mental proces­
ses is continuously fulfilled. However, every Now of the mental 
process also has its necessary horizon of After, and that is also not an 
empty horizon; of necessity every Now of the mental process, even if it < 165) 
is the end-phase of duration pertaining to a mental process which is 
ceasing, changes into a new Now, and it is of necessity a fulfilled one.
In that connection, one can also say: O f necessity there is attached

to the consciousness of Now the consciousness of the just past, the 
consciousness of which is itself again a Now. No mental process can cease 
without there being consciousness of the ceasing and of the having ceased, and 
that is a newly filled out Now. The stream of mental processes is an 
infinite unity, and the stream-form is a form which necessarily comprises 
all mental processes pertaining to a pure Ego — a <form> with a variety of 
systems of forms.
We reserve for future expositions, already announced, the more 
precise elaboration of these insights and the pointing out of their 
great metaphysical consequences.
The universal peculiarities of mental processes just dealt with, as 
possible data of reflective (immanental) perception, are a compo­
nent part of a still more comprehensive peculiarity which is stated in 
the eidetic law that every mental process in an essentially self-enclosed 
concatenation of mental processes is not only considered in view of 
temporal succession but in view of simultaneity. That means that every 
Now of a mental process has a horizon of mental processes which also 
have precisely the originary form of “Now” and, as “Now,” make up 
an originary horizon of the pure Ego, its total originary Now of conscious­
ness.
In a unitary way this horizon enters into the modes of the past. As a 
modified Now, every Before implies for every mental process in view, 
whose Before it is, an infinite horizon embracing everything which 
belongs to the same modified Now; in short, it embraces its horizon of 
“what was simultaneously.” The descriptions given a little while ago 
are therefore to be supplemented by a new dimension, and only when 
we do that do we have the whole field of phenomenological time of the 
pure Ego — <a field> which, from any one of “its” mental processes, it 
can traverse according to the three dimensions of Earlier, Later, and 
Simultaneity; or, in other words, we have the whole, essentially unified 
and strictly self-contained stream of temporal unities of mental proces­
ses.
One pure Ego — one stream of mental processes fulfilled with 
respect to all three dimensions, essentially concatenated in this 
fulfilling, summoning itself in its continuity of content: these are 
necessary correlates.

§83. Seizing Upon the Unitary Stream of Mental Processes as “Idea ”
To this primal form of consciousness the following is related by eidetic 
law.
When the pure regard of the Ego reaches any mental process by 
reflecting and, more particularly, by seizing upon it perceptually, the 
possibility then exists of the regard turning toward other mental 
processes as far as this concatenation reaches. But by essential necessi­
ty this whole concatenation is never given or to be given by a single 
pure regard. In spite of this, it also can be seized upon intuitively in a 
certain, albeit essentially different way; <the whole can be seized upon> 
in the fashion of “limitlessness in the progression” of intuitions of the 
immanent going from the fixed mental process to new mental proces­
ses pertaining to its horizon of mental processes, from its fixing to 
those of its horizons; etc. The term horizon of mental processes not only 
signifies here, however, the horizon of phenomenological temporali­
ty according to its described dimensions, but also differences in novel 
modes of givenness. Accordingly, a mental process which has become 
an Object of an Ego-regard, which therefore has the mode of being 
made an object of regard, has its horizon of unregarded mental 
processes; a mental process seized upon in a mode of “attention” and 
possibly in unceasing clarity, has a horizon of inattention in the 
background with relative differences of clarity and obscurity as well 
as salientness and lack of salientness. Eidetic possibilities are rooted 
therein: <the eidetic possibility) of making the unregarded an object 
of the pure regard, of making the marginally noticed the primally 
noticed; of the making of the unsalient salient, the obscure clear and 
always clearer.28
In the continuous progression from seizing-upon to seizing-upon, 
in a certain way, I said, we now seize upon the stream of mental processes 
as a unity. We do not seize upon it as we do a single mental process but 
rather in the m anner of an idea in the Kantian sense. It is not something 
posited or affirmed by chance; it is instead an absolutely indubitable 
givenness. Even though it is also grounded in intuition, this indubita- 
bility has a source entirely different from that which exists for the 
being of mental processes, which therefore becomes given in the 
perception of the immanent. It is precisely the peculiarity of the
28 
a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : “Horizon” thus has the same value here as the terms “halo” and 
“background.”

ideation which sees a Kantian “idea” that it does not on that 
<167) account, perhaps, lose the insight because the adequate determina­
tion ofits content, here the stream of mental processes, is unattaina­
ble. At the same time we see that a series of distinguishable modes of 
givenness belongs to the stream of mental processes and its compo­
nents — a series of modes of givenness the systematic inquiry into 
which must form a chief task of universal phenomenology.
On the basis of our considerations we can also formulate the 
eidetically valid and evidential statement that no concrete mental process 
can be accepted as a self-sufficient one in thefull sense. Each is “in need of 
supplementation” with respect to a prescribed concatenation, which 
is therefore not arbitrary according to its kind and form.
E.g. : We observe any perception of something external, let us say 
of this determined perception of a house taken in concrete fullness; 
there then belongs to this perception the surroundings of mental 
processes as a necessary determinational part; however, it is, to be 
sure, a specifically peculiar, necessary and yet “extra-essential” deter­
minational part, namely that determinational part the change of 
which alters nothing in the essential contents proper to the mental 
process.29 Thus perception itself changes according to change in determined­
ness of the surroundings, while the ultimate specific differences of the 
genus Perception, its inner ownness, can be conceived as identical.
That, in this ownness, two essentially identical perceptions are also 
identical with respect to the determination of the surroundings, is of 
essential necessity impossible for they would then be individually one 
perception.30
In any case, one can make that evident with respect to two 
perceptions and therefore to any two mental processes whatever 
which belong to one stream of mental processes. Every mental process 
influences the (bright or dark) halo of further mental processes.
A more precise consideration would show, besides, that two streams 
of mental processes (spheres of consciousness for two pure Egos) of an 
identically essential content are inconceivable, as well that no completely 
determined mental process of the one stream can belong to the other — 
which can be seen from what has been said before; only mental 
processes of an identical inner characteristic can be common to them
29 Marginal note to this phrase in Copy D: proper as perception
30 Marginal note to (his paragraph in Copy D: thus the individual difference inheres in the 
surroundings and hcnce in the temporal locus.

(although not common as individually identical), but not two31 
mental processes which, in addition, have a “halo” absolutely alike.
§84. Intentionality as Principal Theme of Phenomenology
We now pass over to a peculiarity of mental processes, to intentiona­
lity, which one can directly designate as the general theme of “Objec­
tively” oriented phenomenology.32 Intentionality is an essential <168) 
peculiarity of the sphere of mental processes taken universally in so 
far as all mental processes in some manner or other share in it; 
nevertheless, we cannot say oieach mental process that it has intention­
ality in the same sense as when we say, e.g., of each mental process, 
even if it is an abstract moment of the mental process entering as 
Object into the regard of possible reflection, that it is a temporal 
<mental process>. Intentionality is what characterizes consciousness in 
the pregnant sense and which, at the same time, justifies designating 
the whole stream of mental processes as the stream of consciousness 
and as the unity of one consciousness.
In the preliminary eidetic analyses of the Second Part concerning 
consciousness in its universality (still at the entrance gate to pheno­
menology and, more particularly, for the goal of acquiring it by the 
method of the reduction) it was already necessary to work out a series 
of the most universal determinations concerning any intentionality 
whatever and concerning the distinctiveness of “acts,” of the “cogi­
tatio.”33 We have made further use of them, and had to do so even 
though the original analyses were still not carried out under the 
explicit norm of the <transcendental> phenomenological reduction. 
Because they concern the pure essence proper of mental processes, 
they cannot, as a consequence, be touched by the excluding of the 
psychological apperception and positing of being. Since it is now a 
matter of explaining intentionality as a comprehensive name for all-inclusive 
phenomenological structures, and to sketch the sets of problems essentially 
related to these structures (in so far as that is possible in a general 
introduction), we shall recapitulate what we said earlier but in a 
form required by our goals which now have an essentially different 
direction.

Under intentionality we understand the own peculiarity of mental 
processes “to be consciousness of something.” We first of all encoun­
ter this marvelous ownness, back to which all rational-theoretical 
and metaphysical enigmas lead, in the explicit cogito: a perceiving is a 
perceiving of something, perhaps a physical thing; a judging is a 
judging of a predicatively formed affair-complex; valuing of a 
predicatively formed value-complex; a wishing of a predicatively 
formed wish-complex; and so forth. Acting bears upon action. Doing 
bears upon the deed, loving bears upon the loved one, being glad 
bears upon the gladsome; and so forth. In every actional cogito a 
<169) radiating “regard” is directed from the pure Ego to the “object” of 
the consciousness-correlate in question, to the physical thing, to the 
affair-complex, etc., and effects the very different kinds of conscious­
ness of it. However, now, phenomenological reflection teaches that 
this object!vating, thinking, valuing ... Ego-advertence, this being- 
busied-with-the-correlate-object actionally, this being-directed-to-it 
(or also away from it — and yet with the regard upon it) is not to be 
found in every mental process: even so <the mental process> can still 
include intentionality within itself. Thus it is clear, for instance, that 
the objective background, from out of which the cognitively per­
ceived object is singled out by virtue of the fact that the distinctive 
Ego-advertence is allocated to it, is, as a mental process, actually an 
objective background. That is, while we are now adverted to the pure 
object in the mode of “cogito,” all sorts of objects “appear;” they are 
“intended to” intuitively, they flow together into the intuitive unity 
of a conscious field of objects. It is a potential field of perception in the 
sense that a particular perceiving (an attentive cogito) can advert to 
something which thus appears; but not in the sense as though the 
sensation-adumbrations present as a mental process, e.g., the visual 
<sensation-adumbrations> spread out in the unity of the visual 
sensation-field, lack any objective construing and therefore only 
constitute intuitive appearances of objects with the adverting of the 
regard.
There belong here, moreover, mental processes of the actionality- 
background, such as the “arousal” of likings, of judgments, of wishes, 
etc., at different distances in the background or, as we can also say, at 
a distance from and a nearness to the Ego, since the actional pure Ego 
living in the particular cogitationes is the point of reference. A liking, 
a wishing, a judging, and the like, can be “effected” in the specific 
sense, namely by the Ego which is “livingly busied” in this effecting

(or, as in the “effecting” of sorrow, <the Ego> actionally “undergoes 
suffering” ); but such modes of consciousness can already be “stir­
ring” be arising in the “background” without having to be “effec­
ted.” With respect to their own essence these non-actionalities are 
likewise already “consciousness of something.” As a consequence, we 
have not included in the essence of intentionality what is specific to 
the cogito, the “regard-to,” (what is still to be understood in various 
ways and phenomenologically investigated) the Ego-advertence;34 
we have instead accepted this cogitatio as a particular modality of < 170) 
that something universal which we call intentionality.
On Terminology
In the Logische Untersuchungen precisely this something universal is 
designated as “act-characteristic” and every concrete mental process 
of this characteristic as “act.” The continual misinterpretations 
which this concept of act has undergone has decided me (here as in 
lectures for a number of years back) to delimit the terminology 
somewhat more cautiously and no longer to use the expressions act 
and intentive mental process as equivalent without taking precau­
tions. The sequel will establish the fact that my original concept of act 
is everywhere quite indispensable, but that it is continually necessary 
to take into account the modal differences between acts which are 
and are not effected.
When nothing is added, and we speak simply of act, we mean 
exclusively the genuine, so to speak, actionally effected acts.
Moreover, we must note quite universally that in phenomenology, 
at the beginning, all concepts or terms must remain in flux in a 
certain way, always at the point of being differentiated in accord 
with the progress of the analysis of consciousness and the cognition of 
new phenomenological strata within what is at first seen in undiffer­
entiated unity. All terms chosen have their tendencies of being 
connected <with other terms>; they refer to relational directions, of 
which it is afterwards brought out that they do not have their source 
only in one essence-stratum; as a result, it is better to limit or otherwise 
to modify the terminology at the same time. Therefore we can only 
count on definitive terminologies at a very advanced stage of deve-

lopment of a science. It is an error and basically absurd to apply 
extrinsic and formal criteria of a logic of terminology to scientific 
expositions which are just emerging and to demand terminologies of 
the sort which fix the concluding results of great scientific develop­
ments at the beginning. For the beginning, any expression is good 
and, more particularly, any suitably chosen figurative expression 
which enables us to guide our regard to a phenomenological occur­
rence which can be seized upon clearly. Clarity does not exclude a 
certain halo of indeterminateness. Its further determination or clari­
fication is precisely the futher task just as is, on the other hand, the 
internal analysis carried out by comparisons or by varying the 
<171) contexts: the dividing up into components or strata. Those who, 
dissatisfied with the intuitive demonstrations, demand “definitions” 
as in the “exact” sciences or who believe that they can easily get 
along in a non-intuitive scientific thinking and thereby advance 
phenomenology with phenomenological concepts acquired from 
rough analyses of a couple of examples and which they assume to be 
fixed, are but beginners who have not yet even grasped the essence of 
phenomenology and the method essentially and necessarily required 
by it.
W hat has just been said is true no less for the empirically oriented 
psychological phenomenology in the sense of a description of psycho­
logical phenomena which is attached to what essentially pertains to 
the immanent.
The concept of intentionality, apprehended in its undetermined 
range, as we have apprehended it, is a wholly indispensable funda­
mental concept which is the starting point at the beginning of 
phenomenology. The universality which it designates may be ever so 
vague prior to more precise investigation; it may enter into an ever so 
great plurality of essentially different formations; it may be ever so 
difficult to set forth in rigorous and clear analyses what makes up the 
pure essence of intentionality, which components of the concrete 
formations genuinely contain it in themselves and to which <compo- 
nents> it is intrinsically alien — in any case, mental processes are 
observed from a determined and highly im portant point of view 
when we cognize them as intentive and say of them that they are 
consciousness of something. It is, moreover, indifferent to us in such 
assertions whether concrete mental processes of abstract strata of 
mental processes are involved: for they can also show the peculiarity 
in question.

§85. Sensuous iikrj, Intentive fitOQ<pt]
We already suggested above, when we characterized the stream of 
mental processes as a unity of consciousness, that intentionality, 
disregarding its enigmatic forms and levels, is also like a universal 
medium which ultimately bears in itself all mental processes, even 
those which are not themselves characterized as intentive. At the 
level of consideration to which we are confined until further notice, a 
level which abstains from descending into the obscure depths of the 
ultimate consciousness which constitutes all such temporality as 
belongs to mental processes,35 and instead takes mental processes as 
they offer themselves as unitary temporal processes in reflection on 
what is immanent, we must, however, essentially distinguish two 
things:
1. all the mental processes designated in the Logische Untersuchungen < 1 72) 
as “primary contents;”36
2. the mental processes or their moments which bear in themselves 
the specific trait of intentionality.37
Among the former belong certain “sensuous” mental processes 
which are unitary with respect to their highest genus, “sensation- 
contents” such as color-Data, touch-Data and tone-Data, and the like, 
which we shall no longer confuse with appearing moments of physi­
cal things— coloredness, roughness, etc. — which “present themsel­
ves” to mental processes \erlebnismafiig] by means of those ^ ‘con­
tents”). Likewise the sensuous pleasure, pain and tickle sensations, 
and so forth, and no doubt also sensuous moments belonging to the 
sphere of “drives.” We find such concrete really immanental Data as 
components in more inclusive concrete mental processes which are 
intentive as wholes; and, more particularly, we find those sensuous 
moments overlaid by a stratum which, as it were, “animates,” which 
bestows sense (or essentially involves a bestowing of sense) — a stratum 
by which precisely the concrete intentive mental process arises from

37 Marginal note in Copy A: Accordingly, that would ultimately be intentionality at a higher level

W hether everywhere and necessarily such sensuous mental proces­
ses in the stream of mental processes bear some “animating cons­
truing” or other (with all the characteristics which this, in turn, 
demands and makes possible), whether, as we also say, they always 
have intentivefunctions, is not to be decided here. On the other hand, we 
likewise leave it undecided at first if the characteristics essentially 
making up intentionality can have concreteness without having 
sensuous foundations.
Be that as it may, this remarkable duality and unity of sensuous ukr| 
and intentive jJiOQcpf] plays a dominant role in the whole phenome­
nological sphere. In fact these concepts of stuff and form force 
themselves upon us if we presentiate to ourselves any clear intuitions 
or clearly effected valuations, acts of liking, willings, or the like. The 
intentive mental processes are there as unities by virtue of sense- 
bestowing (in a greatly extended sense). Sensuous Data present 
themselves as stuffs for intentive formings, or sense-bestowings, be­
longing to different levels, for simple formings and formings which 
<173) are founded in a peculiar manner; we shall return to this in greater 
detail. T hat these locutions are very fitting will be confirmed from 
another side by the doctrine of “correlates.” As for the possibilities 
left open above, they should be entitled accordingly formless stuffs and 
stuffless forms.
With respect to terminology, the following may be added. The 
expression, primary content, no longer appears to us sufficiently 
characteristic. On the other hand, the expression, sensuous mental 
process, cannot be used for the same concept because general locut­
ions such as sensuous perceptions, sensuous intuitions of every sort, 
sensuous gladness, and the like, stand in the way — locutions charac­
terizing as sensuous intentive mental processes rather than bare 
hyletic processes; owing to its new ambiguities, the locution, “bare,” 
or “pure,” sensuous processes, obviously would not improve the 
matter. In addition there are the peculiar ambiguities belonging to 
the word “sensuous” {“sinnlich”], which are retained after the phe­
nomenological reduction. Apart from the double sense which surfa­
ces in the contrast between “sense-bestowing” [“sinngebend”] and 
“sensuous” and which, disturbing as it occasionally is, can hardly be 
avoided, the following should be mentioned: sensuousness [Sinnlich- 
keit] in a narrower sense designates the phenomenological residuum 
of what is conveyed by the “senses” in normal perception of the 
external. After the reduction there becomes apparent an essential

kinship among the remaining “sensuous” Data of intuitions of the 
external; and to it corresponds a peculiar generic essence, correla- 
tivelv a fundamental concept of phenomenology. In the broader and 
essentially unitary sense, however, sensuousness also comprises the 
sensuous feelings and drives which have their own generic unity and, 
on the other side, no doubt likewise an essential kinship of a general 
sort with the aforesaid sensuousness in the narrower sense — all that 
regardless of the additional community expressed by the functional 
concept of hyle. Together, both compelled the old transference of the 
orignially narrow term sensuousness to the spheres of emotion and 
will, namely to the intentive mental processes in which sensuous Data 
belonging to the designated spheres make their appearance as func­
tioning “stuffs.” Be that as it may, therefore, we need a new term 
which expresses the whole group by the unity of the function and the 
contrast to the forming characteristics; and we choose for it the 
expression hyletic Data or stuff-Data, likewise simply sensuous stuffs.
Where it is necessary to awaken the memory of the old expressions, 
unavoidable in their way, we shall speak of sensual, indeed even 
sensuous stuff [sensuelle, wohl auch sinnliche Stoffe].
W hat forms the stuff into intentive mental processes and what <174) 
brings in that which is specific to intentionality is precisely the same 
thing as what gives the locution, consciousness, its specific sense: 
precisely according to which consciousness eo ipso indicates some­
thing of which it is consiousness.38 Because, now, the locutions, 
moments of consciousness, awarenesses, and similar constructions, 
and likewise because the locution, intentive moments, are made 
quite unusable by the many different equivocations which will be 
distinctly brought out in what follows, we introduce the term noetic 
moment or, in short, noesis. These noeses make up what is specific to 
nous in the broadest sense of the word; it refers us back, according to all its 
actional life-forms, to cogitationes and then to any intentive mental 
processes whatever^ and as a result comprises everything (and essen­
tially only that) which is the eidetic presupposition of the idea of the norm.
At the same time, it is not unwelcome that the word, nous, recalls one 
ofits distinctive significations, namely precisely “sense ” although the 
“sense-bestowing” which is effected in the noetic moments compri­
ses many different things and only as foundation <comprises> a 
“sense-bestowing” following upon ^he pregnant concept of sense.
M arginal note in Copy A to this sentence: modes of appearance and position-takings?

There would be good grounds for designating this noetic side of 
mental processes as the psychical side. This is because the regard of the 
philosophical psychologists was directed, with a certain perference, 
in the locutions of 
and the psychical to what <the locution>
intentionality introduces, while the sensuous moments were predica­
ted of the organism and its sensuous activities.39 This old tendency 
has found its most recent expression in Brentano’s differentiation of 
“physical” and “psychical” phenomena. It is especially significant 
because the <differentiation> blazed the trail for the development of 
phenomenology — although Brentano himself still remained far 
from the phenomenological standpoint, and although he did not 
encounter with his differentiation what he really searched for: 
namely the differentiation of the realm of experience pertaining to 
the physical natural sciences from psychology. W hat is of special 
concern for us here is only the following: Brentano, more particular­
ly, still did not find the concept of stuff-moments — and this is 
because he did not take account of the differentiation between the 
“physical phenomena” as stuff-moments (sensation-Data) and 
‘'physical phenomena” as objective moments (physical color, phys­
ical shape, and the like) appearing in the noetic apprehension of the
< 175) former — in contradistinction, on the other side he characterizes the 
concept of “psychical phenomena” in one of its delimiting deter­
minations by the peculiarity of intentionality. Precisely as a result he 
brought the “psychical” into the sphere of vision of our times in that 
distinctive sense which had a certain emphasis but was not annuled 
in the historical signification of the word.
But what speaks against the use of the term as equivalent to 
intentionality is the circumstance that, without doubt, it is not 
suitable to designate in the same way the psychical in this sense <scl. 
intentionality> and the psychical in the sense of the psychological 
(therefore of that which is the peculiar Object of psychology). More­
over, in view of this latter concept we also have the disagreeable 
ambiguity which has its source in the familiar tendency toward a 
“psychology without a soul.” Belonging together with that is the fact 
that under the heading of the psychical — especially of the actual 
psychical in contrast to the corresponding “psychical dispositions” — 
one preferably thinks of mental processes in the unity of the empiri­
cally40 posited stream of mental processes. But it is now unavoidable

40 In Copy D  empirically changed to Objectively-real

to designate as Object of psychology, as also the psychical, the real 
bearers of this psychical, the animate beings, or their “souls” and 
their psychically real properties. The “psychology without a soul” 
c o n f u s e s ,  as it would seem to us, the exclusion of the soul-entity, in the 
sense of some sort of nebulous metaphysics of the soul, with the 
exclusion of the soul taken universally, i.e., the psychical reality 
factually given in empeiria, the states of which are mental processes. By 
no means is this reality the mere stream of mental processes insepara­
ble from the organism and empirically governed in certain ways, for 
which dispositional concepts are mere indices to their regularities. 
Nevertheless, the presence of equivocations and, above all, the cir­
cumstance that the dominant concepts of the psychical do not bear 
upon the specifically intentional, make the term unsuitable for us.
We therefore retain the term noetic and say:
The stream of phenomenological being has a stuff-stratum and a noetic 
stratum.
Phenomenological considerations and analyses which specifically 
concern stuff can be termed hyletic-phenomenological ones just as, on the 
other hand, those relative to the noetic moments can be termed noetic- 
phenomenological considerations and analyses. The incomparably more 
important and richer analyses are found on the side of the noetic.
§86. The Functional Problems.41
Nonetheless, the greatest problems of all are the functional problems, or 
those of the “constitution of consciousness-objectivities ” <These problems> 
concern the way in which noeses, e.g., with respect to Nature, by 
animating stuff and combining it into manifold-unitary continua 
and syntheses bring about consciousness of something such that the 
Objective unity of the objectivity allows of being harmoniously 
“made known,” “legitimated” and “rationally” determined.
In this sense ‘ function” (in an entirely different sense in contrast to 
the mathematical one) is something wholly unique, grounded in the 
pure essence of noesis. Consciousness is precisely consciousness “o f’ 
something; it is ofits essence to bear in itself “sense,” so to speak, the 
quintessence of “soul,” “spirit,” “reason.” Consciousness is not a 
name for “psychical complexes,” for “contents” fused together, for
<176)

“bundles” or streams of “sensations” which, without sense in them­
selves, also cannot lend any “sense” to whatever mixture; it is rather 
through and through “consciousness,” the source of all reason and 
unreason, all legitimacy and illegitimacy, all reality and fiction, all 
value and disvalue, all deed and misdeed. Consciousness is therefore 
toto coelo different from what sensualism42 alone will see, from what 
in fact is irrational stuff without sense — but which is, of course, 
accessible to rationalization. We shall soon learn to better under­
stand what rationalization signifies.
The point of view of function is the central one for phenomenology; 
the investigations radiating from it suitably comprise the whole 
phenomenological sphere, and, finally, all phenomenological analy­
ses in some m anner or other enter into its service as component parts 
or preliminary stages. In place of analysis and comparison, descrip­
tion and classification restricted to single particular mental proces­
ses, consideration arises of single particularities from the “ teleologi- 
cal” point of view of their function, of making possible a “synthetical 
unity.” O f essential necessity the consideration turns to the multipli­
cities of consciousness, predelineated, so to speak, in or, as it were, 
extracted from, the mental processes themselves, their noeses of 
whatever sort: thus, e.g., in the sphere of experience and experimen­
tal thinking, <the consideration turns to> the multiformed continua 
of consciousness and the discontinuous connections of consciousness- 
processes which are connected in themselves by belonging to conca­
tenations of sense by means of the unitarily encompassing conscious- 
<177) ness of one and the same Objective something, sometimes appearing 
in this way, sometimes in that way, being given intuitively or being 
conceptually determined. <The consideration) seeks to inquire into 
how something self-identical, how Objective unities of any kind 
which are not really immanental are “intended to,” “meant;” how 
consciousness-formations of very different and yet essentially requi­
red structures belong to the identity of the meant, and how these 
formations are to be strictly described which respect to method. 
Moreover, <the consideration) seeks to inquire into how, correspon­
ding to the double heading of “reason” and “unreason,” the unity of 
the objectivity of any objective region and category can and must be 
“legitimated” and “rejected,” how it can and must be determined in 
the forms of consciousness, more “precisely” determined or deter-

mined “otherwise,” or be entirely rejected as “null,” “illusion.” In 
that context all distinctions are accordingly subsumed under the 
trivial and yet so paradoxical headings of “actuality” and “illusion,” 
“true” reality, “illusion-reality,” “true” values, “illusory value and 
disvalue,” the phenomenological clarification of which follows upon 
<these considerations).
It is therefore a m atter of inquiring, in the most comprehensive 
universality, into how Objective unities of any region and category 
are “constituted in the manner peculiar to consciousness.” It is a 
question ofsystematically showing how, by its essence, all the concatena­
tions of actual and possible consciousness — precisely as eidetic 
possibilities — are predelineated: from the simple or founded intui­
tions intentively related to them, the confused or clear, expressive or 
non-expressive, prescientific or scientific formations at lower or high­
er levels produced by thinking, to the highest formations of strict, 
theoretical science.43 All of the basic kinds of possible consciousness 
and the variations, fusions,44 syntheses of essential necessity belong­
ing to them are a m atter to be studied and made evident in eidetic 
universality and phenomenological purity; how <these basic kinds,> 
by their own peculiar essence predelineate all possibilities of being (and 
impossibilities of being); how, according to absolutely fixed eidetic 
laws an existing object is the correlate for concatenations of cons­
ciousness of quite determined eidetic contents, just as, conversely, the 
being of such concatenations is equivalent to an existing object; and 
that, referred to all regions of being and all levels of universality down 
to the concretion of being.
In its purely eidetic attitude “excluding” every sort of transcen­
dence, on its own peculiar basis of pure consciousness, phenomenolo- < 1 
gy necessarily arrives at this entire complex of transcendental problems in 
the specific sense, and on that account deserves the name of transcendental 
phenomenology. On its own peculiar basis phenomenology must come 
to consider mental processes not as any sort of dead fact such as 
“content-complexes” which merely exist without signifying any­
thing, <without> meaning anything; nor should it consider them only 
with respect to elements, complexes of constructions, with respect to 
elements, complexes of constructions with respect to classes and 
subclasses;45 <transcendental phenomenology should> instead make

itself master of the essentially unique set of problems which mental 
processes offer, and offer purely by their eidetic essence, as intentive mental 
processes, as “ consciousness-of”
Naturally, the pure hyletic is subordinated to the phenomenology of 
transcendental consciousness. In addition, it has the characteristic of 
a self-contained discipline; as a self-contained discipline it has a value 
in itself; on the other hand, but from a functional point of view, it has 
signification by the fact that it provides possible gussets in the 
intentional weave, possible stuffs for intentive formations. Not only 
with regard to the difficulties which it arrives at, but also with regard 
to the ranking of problems from the standpoint of the idea of an 
absolute cognition, it obviously stands far below the noetic and 
functional phenomenology (both of which, moreover, are properly 
not to be separated).46
We now turn to more precise expositions in the following chapters.
Note
The word, function, in the phrase “psychical function,” is used by 
Stumpf in his important47 essay for the Berlin academy48 in con­
trast to what he calls “appearance.” The distinction is meant as a 
psychological one, and coincides, then, with our opposition (only 
applied psychologically) between “acts” and “primary contents.” It 
is to be noted that the terms in question in our presentation have a 
completely different signification when in those of the distinguished 
investigator. Superficial readers of both writings have confused more 
than once Stum pf s concept of phenomenology (as the doctrine of 
“appearances” ) with ours. Stumpfs phenomenology would corres­
pond to what was defined above as hyletic, except that our definition
< 179) in its methodical sense is essentially conditioned by the encompassing 
frame of transcendental phenomenology. On the other hand, the 
idea of the hyletic eo ipso is transferred from phenomenology to the 
basis of an eidetic psychology which, according to our conception, 
would include Stum pfs “phenomenology.”

§87. Preliminary Remarks.1
The peculiarity of the intentive mental process is easily designated in 
its universality; we all understand the expression “consciousness of 
something,” especially in ad libitum exemplifications. It is so much 
more difficult to purely and correctly seize upon the phenomenologi­
cal essence-peculiarities corresponding to it. That this heading cir­
cumscribes a large field of painfully achieved findings and, more 
particularly, of eidetic findings, would seem even today alien to the 
majority of philosophers and psychologists (if we can judge by the 
literature). This is because nothing is accomplished by saying and 
discerning that every objectivating relates to something objectiva- 
ted, that every judging relates to something judged, etc. O r that, in 
addition, one refers to logic, theory of knowledge, ethics, with their 
many evidences, and now designates these as belonging to the essence 
of intentionality. This is, at the same time, a very simple way of 
taking the phenomenological doctrine of essences as something very 
old, as a new name for the old logic and those disciplines which must 
be ranked with it. For without having seized upon the peculiar 
ownness of the transcendental attitude and having actually appro­
priated the pure phenomenological basis, one may of course use the 
word, phenomenology; but one does not have the matter itself. In 
addition, it does not suffice, let us say, to merely change the attitude, 
or to merely carry out the phenomenological reduction in order to 
make something like phenomenology out of pure logic. For how far 
logical and, in a like way, pure ontological, pure ethical, and what­
ever other apriori propositions one may cite, actually express some­
thing phenomenological, and to which phenomenological strata the

respective <propositions> may belong, is not obvious. On the contra­
ry, the most difficult problems of all are hidden, <problems> the sense 
of which is naturally concealed from all those who still have no 
inkling of the determinative fundamental distinctions. In fact, it is (if 
<180) I may be allowed a judgment from my own experience) a long and 
thorny way starting from purely logical insights, from insights pertain­
ing to the theory of signification, from ontological and noetical 
insights, likewise from the customary normative and psychological 
theory of knowledge, to arrive at seizing upon, in a genuine sense, the 
immanent-psychological and then phenomenological data, and fi­
nally to arrive at all at the concatenations of essence which make the 
transcendental relations intelligible apriori. Something similar is the 
case no m atter from where we might set out on the way from 
objective insights to acquire phenomenological insights which essen­
tially belong to them.
“Consciousness of something” is therefore something obviously 
understandable of itself and, at the same time, highly enigmatic. The 
labyrinthically false paths into which the first reflections lead, easily 
generate a skepticism which negates the whole troublesome sphere of 
problems. Not a few already bar access by the fact that they cannot 
bring themselves to seize upon the intentive mental process, e.g., the 
perceptual process, with the essence proper to it as perceptual pro­
cess. Rather than living in the perception, adverted to the perceived 
in considering and theorizing they do not manage to direct the 
regard instead to the perceiving, or to the own peculiarities of the 
mode of givenness of the perceived, and to take what is offered in 
analysis of something immanent with respect to its essence, just as it 
is given. If the right attitude has been won, and made secure by 
practice, above all, however, il one has acquired the courage to obey 
the clear eidetic data with a radical lack of prejudice so as to be 
unencumbered by all current and learned theories, then firm results 
are directly produced, and the same thing occurs for everyone having 
the same attitude; there accrue firm possibilities of communicating to 
others what one has himself seen, of testing descriptions, of making 
salient the unnoticed intrusions of empty verbal meanings, of making 
known and weeding out errors by measuring them again against 
intuition — errors which are also possible here just as in any sphere of 
validity. But now to the matters at hand.

§88. Really Inherent and Intentive Components of Mental Processes.
The Noema.
If, as in the present deliberations generally, we begin with the most 
universal distinctions which, so to speak, can be seized upon at the 
very threshold of phenomenology, and which are determinative for 
all further methodic proceedings, then with respect to intentionality <181) 
we immediately confront a wholly fundamental distinction, namely 
the distinction between the components proper2 of intentive mental 
processes and their intentional correlates and their components. We 
already touched upon this distinction in the preliminary eidetical 
deliberations of Part II.3 In that connection, in making the transi­
tion from the natural to the phenomenological attitude, the distinction 
served us to make clear the own peculiar being of the phenomenolo­
gical sphere. But that it acquired a radical signification within this 
sphere itself, thus in the frame of the transcendental reduction, 
conditioning the entire set of problems pertaining to phenomenolo­
gy: of that we could not speak there. On the one side therefore, we 
have to discriminate the parts and moments which we find by an 
analysis of the really inherent pertaining to mental processes, whereby we 
deal with the mental process as an object like any other, inquiring 
about its pieces or non-selfsufficient moments really inherent in it 
which make it up. But, on the other side, the intentive mental process 
is consciousness of something, and it is so according to its essence, e.g., 
as memory, as judgment, as will, etc.; and we can therefore inquire 
into what is to be declared as a m atter of essential necessity about the 
side of this “of something.”
Owing to its noetic moments, every intentive mental process is 
precisely noetic;4,5 it is of its essence to include in itself something 
such as a “sense” and possibly a manifold sense on the basis of this 
sense-bestowal and, in unity with that, to effect further productions 
[Leistungen] which become “senseful” precisely by <this sense-
2 The following note, published by Schuhmann as Appendix 51, ca. 1923, appended in Copy D: It is not until 
p. 199 that it is said in passing that “noesis” signifies the same thing as “ concrete-complete 
intentive mental process,” with “emphasis on its noetic components.” Th u s xhchyletic moments 
belong to the noesis in so far as they hear the function^of intentionality, undergo sense-bestowal, 
help constitute a concrete noematic sense. But this must be stated earlier with corresponding 
•seriousness. 1 myself have vacilated before in distinguishing noetic and hyletic moments.

6 Insertion in Copy A: “ noetic;” that signifies

bestowab. Such noetic moments are, e.g., directions of the regard of 
the pure Ego to the objects “ m eant” by it owing to sense-bestowal, to 
<the object) which is “inherent in the sense” for the Ego; furthermore, 
seizing upon this object, holding it fast while the regard adverts to 
other objects which appear in the “ meaning” [“ Vermeinen”]; like­
wise, producings pertaining to explicatings, relatings, comprisings, 
multiple position-takings of believings, deemings likely, valuings; 
and so forth. All of these are to be found in the mental processes in 
question, no m atter how differently structured and varied they are. 
Now, no m atter to what extent this series of exemplary moments refer 
to really inherent components of mental processes, they nevertheless 
also refer to what is not really inherent, namely by means of the heading 
of sense.
Corresponding in every case to the multiplicity of Data pertaining 
to the really inherent noetic content, there is a multiplicity of Data, 
demonstrable in actual pure intuition, in a correlative “noematic 
<182) content” or, in short, in the “noema” — terms which we shall continue 
to use form now on.
Perception, for example, has its noema, most basically its percep­
tual sense,6 i.e., the perceived as perceived. Similarly, the current case of 
remembering has its remembered as remembered, just as its <remem- 
bered>, precisely as it is “meant,” “intended to” in <the remember­
ing); again, the judging has the judged as judged, liking has the liked as 
liked, and so forth. In every case the noematic correlate, which is 
called “sense” here (in a very extended signification) is to be taken 
precisely as it inheres “immanentally” in the mental process of per­
ceiving, ofjudging, ofliking; and so forth; that is,just as it is offered to 
us when we inquire purely into this mental process itself.
How we understand all of this will become clear by carrying out an 
exemplary analysis (which we will effect in pure intuition).
Let us suppose that in a garden we regard with pleasure a blossom­
ing apple tree, the freshly green grass of the lawn, etc. It is obvious 
that the perception and the accompanying liking are not, at the 
same time, what is perceived and liked. In the natural attitude, the 
apple tree is for us something existing in the transcendent realm of 
spatial actuality, and the perception, as well as the liking, is for us a

psychical state belonging to real people. Between the one and the 
other real things, between the real person or the real perception, and 
the real apple tree, there exist real relations. In such situations 
characterizing mental processes, it may be in certain cases that 
perception is “mere hallucination,” the perceived, this apple tree 
before us, does not exist in “actual” reality. Now the real relation, 
previously meant as actually existing, is destroyed. Only the per­
ception remains, but there is nothing actual there to which it is 
related.
Let us now go to the <transcendental> phenomenological attitude.
The transcendent world receives its “parenthesis,” we exercise the 
frtoxr) in relation to <positing> its actual being. We now ask what, of 
essential necessity, is to be discovered in the complex of noetic 
processes pertaining to perception and in the valuation of liking.
With the whole physical and psychical world, the actual existence of <183) 
the real relation between perceiving and perceived is excluded;7 and, 
nonetheless, a relation between perceiving and perceived (as well as 
between liking and liked) remains left over, a relation which becomes 
given essentially in “ pure immanence,” namely purely on the 
ground of the phenemenologically reduced mental processes of per­
ceiving and liking precisely as they fit into the transcendental stream 
of mental processes. Precisely this situation, the purely phenomeno­
logical one, will occupy us now. Concerning hallucinations, illusions 
and perceptual deception of whatever sort, it may be that phenome­
nology has something to say, and perhaps even a great deal: but it is 
evident that here, in the role which they played in the natural 
attitude, they undergo exclusion.8 Here, in the case of perception 
and also in the case of any progressive concatentation of perceptions 
whatever (as when we consider the blossoming tree ambulando), 
there is no question to be raised of the sort whether or not something 
corresponds to it in “ the” actuality.9 This posited actuality10 is 
indeed not there for us in consequence of judging.11 And yet, so to

speak, everything remains as of old. Even the phenomenologically 
reduced perceptual mental process is a perceiving of“this blossoming 
apple tree, in this garden,” etc., and, likewise, the reduced liking is a 
liking of this same thing. The tree has not lost the least nuance of all 
these moments, qualities, characteristics with which it was appearing in 
this perception, <with which> it <was appearing as> “lovely,” “attractive ” 
and so forth “in” this liking.
In our <transcendental> phenomenological attitude we can and 
must raise the eidetic question: what the “perceived as perceived” is, which 
eidetic moments it includes in itself as this perception-noema. We receive the 
answer in the pure directedness to something given in its essence, and we 
can faithfully describe the “appearing as appearing” in complete 
evidence. It is only another expression for this to say that we “de­
scribe perception in its noematic respect.”
§89. Noematic Statements and Statements About Actuality. The Noema in the 
Psychological Sphere.12
It is clear that all these descriptive statements, even though they may 
sound like statements about actuality, have undergone a radical 
modification of sense; similarly, the described itself, even though it is
< 184) given as “precisely the same,” is yet something radically different by 
virtue of, so to speak, an inverse change of signs. “ In” the reduced 
perception (in the phenomenologically pure mental process), we 
find, as indefeasibly belonging to its essence, the perceived as percei­
ved, to be expressed as “material thing,” “plant,” “ tree,” “blossom­
ing;” and so forth. Obviously, the inverted commas are significant in 
that they express that change in sign, the correspondingly radical 
significational modification of the words. The tree simpliciter, the 
physical thing belonging to Nature, is nothing less than this perceived 
tree as perceived which, as perceptual sense, inseparably belongs to 
the13 perception. The tree simpliciter can burn up, be resolved into 
its chemical elements, etc. But the sense — the sense of this perception, 
something belonging necessarily to its essence — cannot burn up; it 
has no chemical elements, no forces, no real properties.
Everything which is purely immanent and reduced in the way
12 Addition to title in Copy D : The Psychological Phenomenological Reduction
13 Insertion in Copy A : particular

peculiar to the mental process, everything which cannot be concei­
ved apart from it just as it is in itself, and which eo ipso passes over 
into the Eidos in the eidetic attitude, is separated by an abyss from all 
of Nature and physics and no less from all psychology — and even 
this image, as naturalistic, is not strong enough to indicate the 
difference.
Obviously the perceptual sense also belongs to the phenomenolo- 
gically unreduced perception (perception in the sense of psycholo­
gy). Thus one can make clear here at the same time how the 
phenomenological reduction can acquire for psychologists the useful 
methodic f unction offixing the noematic sense by sharply distinguish­
ing it from the object simpliciter, and recognizing it as something 
belonging inseparably to the14 psychological essence of the intentive 
mental process.
On both sides, in the psychological as well as in the phenomenolo­
gical attitude, one must therefore not lose sight of the fact that the 
“perceived” as sense includes nothing in itself (thus nothing should 
be imputed to it on the ground of “indirect cognizances”) other than 
what “actually appears” in the given case in something perceptually 
appearing and, more precisely, in the mode of givenness in which it is 
precisely something intended to in the perception. At any time a 
specifically peculiar reflection can be directed to this sense as it is imma­
nent in the perception, and the phenomenological judgment has to 
conform in faithful expression to what is seized upon in it.
§90. The “Noematic Sense” and the Distinction Between “ Immanental” and < 185) 
“Actual Objects
like perception, every intentive mental process — just this makes up 
the fundamental part of intentionality — has its “intentional O b­
ject,” i.e., its objective sense. Or, in other words: to have sense or “to 
intend to” somethihg \etwas “im Sinne zu h a b e n is the fundamental 
characteristic of all consciousness which, therefore, is not just any 
mental living [Erlebnis] whatever, but is rather a <mental living> 
having sense, which is “noetic.”
Certainly what has become prominent as “sense” in the analysis of 
our examples does not exhaust the full noema; correspondingly, the
14 Insertion in Copy D : pure

noetic side of the intentive mental process does not merely consist of 
the moment of “sense-bestowal” proper specifically belonging to the 
“sense” as correlate. It will be shown directly that the full noema 
consists of a complex of noematic moments, that in <that complex> the 
specific sense-moment only fashions one kind of necessary core-stratum 
in which further moments are essentially founded which, therefore, 
should likewise be designated as sense-moments, but in an extended 
meaning.
Nevertheless, let us remain at first with what alone has clearly 
emerged. W ithout doubt we have shown that the intentive mental 
process is of such a character that in a suitable focusing of regard a 
“sense” is to be drawn from it. The situation defining the sense for us 
cannot remain concealed: the circumstance, namely, that the non­
existence (or the15 conviction of non-existence) of the objectivated 
or thought of Object pure and simple pertaining to the objectivation 
in question (and therefore to any particular intentive mental process 
whatever) cannot steal its something objectivated as objectivated,16 
that therefore the distinction between both must be made. Such a 
striking distinction has required expression in the literature. As a 
m atter of fact, the Scholastic distinction between the “mental” “inten­
tional39 or “ immanental33 Object on the one hand, and the “actual33 
Object on the other hand, refers back to it. Nevertheless, it is an 
immense step to go from seizing upon a distinction pertaining to 
consciousness for the first time to its right, phenomenologically pure, 
fixing and correct valuation — and precisely this step, which is 
decisive for a harmonious, fruitful phenomenology, has not been 
effected. Above all, what is decisive consists of the absolutely faithful 
description of what is actually present in phenomenological purity 
and in keeping at a distance all the interpretations transcending the 
given. Here denominations already evince interpretations, and often 
quite false ones. These interpretations betray themselves here in 
<186) expressions such as “mental,” “immanental” Object, and the ex­
pression “intentional Object” requires them the least of all.
It would even be tempting to say: In the mental process the 
intention is given with its intentional Object which, as intentional 
Object, inseparably belongs to it, therefore itself inherently dwells 
within <the intention). Indeed, it is and remains its <Object> meant,
15 Insertion in Copy A: subsequent
16 Insertion in Copy A : its something intrndecT 10 in suc h and such a manner

objectivated, and the like, no m atter if the corresponding “ actual 
Object” precisely is or is not in actuality, if it has been annihilated in 
the meantime, etc.
But if, in this way, we try to separate the actual Object (in the case 
of perception of something external, the perceived physical thing 
pertaining to Nature) and the intentional Object, including the 
latter <as> really inherently in the mental process as “immanent” to 
the perception, we fall into the difficulty that now two realities ought 
to stand over against one another while only one <reality> is found to 
be present and even possible. I perceive the physical thing, the 
Object belonging to Nature, the tree there in the garden; that and 
nothing else is the actual Object of the perceptual “intention.” A 
second immanental tree, or even an “internal image” of the actual 
tree standing out there before me, is in no way given, and to suppose 
that hypothetically leads to an absurdity. The image as a really 
inherent component in the psychologically real perception would be 
again something real — something real which would function as a 
depicturing of another something real. But that can only be by virtue 
of a depicturing consciousness in which something first appears — 
with which we would have a first intentionality — and this would 
function again in consciousness as a “picture Object” representing 
another “picture Object” — for which a second intentionality foun­
ded in the first intentionality would be necessary. It is no less evident 
that each particular one of these modes of consciousness already 
requires the distinction between the immanental and actual object, 
thus comprising the same problem which should have been resolved 
by the construction. Over and above this, in the case of perception, 
the construction is subject to the objection which we have discussed 
earlier:17 to include depictive functions in the perception of some­
thing physical signifies ascribing to it a picture-consciousness which, 
descriptively considered, is something of an essentially different kind 
of constitution. Nevertheless, the main point here is that perception 
and, then consequently, every mental process, requires a depictive 
function, unavoidably (as can be seen at once from our critique) 
leads to an infinite regress.
In contradistinction to such errors we have to abide by what is <187) 
given in the pure mental process and to take it within the frame of 
clarity precisely as it is given. The “actual” Object is then to be

“ parenthesized.” Let us reflect on what that signifies: if we begin as 
people in the natural attitude, then the actual Object is the physical 
thing there, outside <us>. We see it, we stand before it, we have 
directed our eyes fixingly to it, and then we describe it and make our 
statements about it just as we find it there in space as what confronts 
us. Likewise we take a position toward it in valuing; what confronts 
us, what we see in space, pleases us, or determines us to act; we seize 
upon or manipulate what is given there, etc. If we now effect the 
phenomenological reduction, then every positing of something trans­
cendent, thus above all what is inherent to perception itself, receives 
its excluding parentheses, and this is passed on to all of the founded 
acts, to every judgm ent of perception, to the positing of value, and 
possibly to the value judgment grounded in it. Implicit in this is that 
we only allow all these perceivings, judgings, etc., to be considered, to 
be described, as the essentialities which they are in themselves, to pin 
down what is evidently given with or in them. But we do not tolerate 
any judgm ent which makes use of the positing of the “ actual” 
physical thing, nor of the whole “ transcendent” Nature, or which 
“joins in” <that positing>. As phenomenologists we abstain from all such 
positings. But on that account we do not reject them by not “taking 
them as our basis,” by not “joining in” them. They are indeed there, 
they also essentially belong to the phenomenon. Rather we contem­
plate them; instead of joining in them, we make them Objects, take 
them as component parts of the phenomenon — the positing pertain­
ing to perception £s well as its components.
And, keeping these excludings in their clear sense, we therefore ask 
quite universally, then, about what is evidentially “inherent” in the 
whole “reduced” phenomenon. Now, inherent too precisely in per­
ception is this: that it has its noematic sense, its “perceived as 
perceived,” “ this blossoming tree there, in space” — understood 
with inverted commas — precisely the correlate belonging to the 
essence of phenomenologically reduced perception. Figuratively 
stated: the “parenthesis” undergone by perception prevents any 
judgm ent about perceived actuality (i.e., any <judgment> having its 
basis in unmodified perception, thus taking up into itself its positing). 
But it does not prevent thejudgment about the fact that perception is
< 188) consciousness of an actuality (the positing of which, however, should 
not be “effected” ); and it does not prevent any description of this 
perceptually appearing “actuality” as appearing with the particular 
ways in which it is here intended to, appearing only “one-sidedly,” in

this or that orientation; and so forth. With minute care we must now 
take heed against attributing to the mental process anything which is 
n o t actually included in its essence, and <we must> “attribute” <what 
is included> exactly and just as it precisely is “inherent” in it.
§91. Extension to the Widest Sphere of Intentionality.
What was carried out in detail primarily in the case of perception 
actually holds now for all kinds of intentive mental processes. After the 
reduction we find the remembered as remembered in remembering, 
the expected as expected in expecting, the phantasied as phantasied 
in inventive phantasy.
“ Inhering” in each of these mental processes in a noematic sen­
se,18 and however this <noematic sense> may be akin in different 
mental processes, indeed perchance essentially quite alike with res­
pect to a core-component, in any case the <noematic sense> is different 
in kind in various sorts of mental processes; what is common in a 
given case is at least differently characterized and is so of necessity. In 
every case it may be a matter of the blossoming tree, and in every case 
this tree may appear in a ccrtain way such that the faithful descrip­
tion of what appears as it appears necessarily results in the same 
expression. But for that reason the noematic correlates are still 
essentially different for perception, phantasy, presentiating some­
thing depicted, remembering, etc. At one time what appears is 
characterized as “actuality in person,” at another time as fiction, 
then again as something presentiated in a remembering, etc.
These are characteristics which we find present in the perceived, 
phantasied, remembered, and so forth, as perceived, phantasied, 
remembered — in the sense of the perception, in the sense of phantasy, in the 
sense of memory — as something inseparable and as something necessarily 
belonging in correlation to the respective kinds of noetic processes.
Where it is a m atter of describing the intentional correlates faith­
fully and completely, there we must also apprehend all such charac­
teristics which are never accidental but are instead governed by 
eidetic law and fixed into rigorous concepts.
In this connection, we note what within the full noema (in fact, as < 189) 
we have previously indicated) we must separate essentially different

strata which which are grouped around a central “core ,”19 around a 
pure “objective sense” — around that which, in our examples, was 
describable with purely identical objective expressions because there 
can be something identical in the parallel mental processes which are 
different in sort. When, again, we set aside the parentheses effected 
on the positing, we see that, in a parallel way, corresponding to the 
different concepts of sense we must distinguish different concepts of 
unmodijied objectivities, of which the “object simpliciter,” namely the 
something identical which is perceived at one time, another time 
directly presentiated, a third time presented pictorially in a painting, 
and the like, only indicates one central concept. This indication is 
sufficient for us in a preliminary way for the moment.
Let us scrutinize the sphere of consciousness still further and try to 
get acquainted with the noetic-noematic structures in the principal 
modes of consciousness. In the actual demonstration we shall, at the 
same time, step by step, assure ourselves of the complete validity of the 
fundamental correlation between noesis and noema.20
§92. The Noetic and Noematic Aspects of Attentional Changes.
In our preparatory chapters we spoke repeatedly of a species of 
remarkable changes in consciousness which cut across all other 
species of intentional events and thus make up a quite universal 
structure of consciousness having its own peculiar dimension: We 
spoke metaphorically of the pure Ego’s “mental regard” or the “ray 
ofits regard,” ofits advertings toward and turning away from. The 
relevant phenomena stood out unitarily for us with perfect clarity 
and distinctness. Wherever “attention” is spoken of originarily, they 
play a major role without being separated phenomenologically from 
certain other phenomena; and, mixed with these others, they are 
usually designated as modes of attention. For our part, we mean to 
retain the word and, moreover, to speak of attentional changes, but with 
exclusive reference to the events we have separated distinctly and the 
groups of phenomenal changes still to be described more precisely in 
what follows.

Addition in Copy A: just as, moreover, also of objectivity simpliciter 
incase it exists there, in 
the broadest sense of the term.

In this context it is a question of a series of ideally possible changes < 190) 
which already presuppose a noetic core and the characterizing 
moments of various genera which necessarily belong to it; of them­
selves, <these possible changes> do not alter the correlative noematic 
productions but, nevertheless, exhibit alterations of the whole mental 
process with respect to both its noetic and noematic sides. The ray of 
the pure Ego’s regard sometimes goes through one noetic stratum 
and sometimes through another, or (as, e.g., in the case of remem­
berings within rememberings21) through one encasement-level or an­
other, sometimes straightforwardly, sometimes reflectively. Within 
the given total field of potential noeses and correlative objects of 
noeses we sometimes look at a whole, the tree, perhaps, which is 
perceptually present, sometimes at these or those parts and moments 
of it; then, again, we look at a nearby physical thing or at a complex 
context and process. Suddenly we turn our regard to an object of 
memory which “comes to mind:” Instead of going through the 
perceptual noesis, which, in a continuously unitary though highly 
articulated manner, constitutes for us the continually appearing 
world of physical things, the regard goes through a remembering 
noesis into a world of memory; it wanders about in this world, passes 
over into memories of other degrees or into worlds of22 phantasy, 
and so forth.
For the sake of simplicity, let us remain in one intentive stratum in 
the world of perception which stands there in simple certainty. Let us 
take a physical thing or a physical process of which there is a 
perceptual consciousness, and fix it, in idea, with respect to its 
noematic contents, while we take the whole concrete consciousness of 
physical thing or the physical process throughout the corresponding 
section of phenomenological duration, and fix it with respect to its 
full immanental essence. For the idea in question involves fixing of 
the attentional ray as wandering in a determinate manner throughout 
that section of phenomenological duration,) since <the attentional 
ray> too is a moment of the mental process. It is then evident that 
modes of alteration of the fixed mental process are possible23 which 
we designate by the name, “alterations merely in the distribution of 
attention and its modes.” It is clear that, throughout such alterat-
il 
Addition in Copy A: which may themselves he, in turn, rememberings of the second or of a still
higher degree
22Insertion in Copy A: mere
23Insertion in Copy A: ideally speaking

ions, the noematic composition of the mental process remains the same 
in so far as one can always say that the same objectivity is continuous­
ly characterized as being there in person, presenting itself in the 
same modes of appearance, in the same orientations, with the same 
appearing traits; that in the modes of indeterminate indication, of 
making non-intuitively copresent, and so forth, there is a conscious­
ness of such and such a stock of content belonging to it. Selecting out 
<191) and comparing parallel noematic components, we say that the alter­
ation consists merely of the fact that, in one of the compared cases, one 
moment of the object is “favored” and, in another case, another; or of 
the fact that one and the same moment is “paid attention to prim ari­
ly” at one time and only secondarily at another time, or “just barely 
noticed still,” if not indeed “completely unnoticed” though still 
appearing. Those are indeed different modes belonging specifically 
to attention as such. Among them the group of actionality modes are 
separated from the non-actionality mode, from what we call complete 
inattention, the mode which is, so to speak, dead consciousness of 
something.24
On the other hand, it is clear not only that these are modifications 
of the mental process itself with respect to its noetic composition, but 
also that they affect its noema, that, on the noematic side — without 
touching the identical noematic core — they present a separate 
genus of characterizations. Attention is usually compared to a spot 
light. The object of attention, in the specific sense, lies in the cone of 
more or less bright light; but it can also move into the penumbra and 
into the completely dark region. Though the metaphor is far from 
adequate to differentiate all the modes which can be fixed phenome- 
nologically, it is still designative in so far as it indicates alterations in 
what appears, as what appears. These changes in its illumination do 
not alter what appears with respect to its own sense -composition; but 
brightness and obscurity modify its mode of appearance: they are to 
be found and described when we direct out regard to the noematic 
Object.
Obviously the modifications in the noema are not of such a kind 
that25 mere outward adjuncts are added to something which re­
mains unvaryingly identical; on the contrary, the concrete noemas

change through and through, it being a question of necessary modes 
belonging to the mode in which the identical is given.
Yet, on closer inspection, it is not the case that the entire noematic 
content (the attentional core, so to speak) characterized by this or that 
mode can be kept constant in contrast to any attentional modifica­
tions whatever.26 On the contrary, looked at from the noetic side it 
becomes apparent that certain noeses, either necessarily or with 
respect to their determined possibility, are conditioned by modes of 
attention and in particular, by positive attention in the distinctive 
sense <of this word>. All ,,effecting of acts,” the “actional takings of 
positions,” e.g., “effecting” the settlement of a doubt, the “making”
[“ Vollzug”] of a refusal, the “effecting” of a27 subject-positing and a <192) 
predicative positing-thereupon, the making [Vollzug] of a valuation 
or of a valuation for the sake of something else, the making of a 
choice, and so forth — all these presuppose positive attention to that 
toward which the Ego takes a position.28 But this in no way alters the 
fact that this functioning of the regard, which moves about and 
broadens or narrows its span, signifies a dimension sui generis of correla­
tive.. noetic and noematic, modifications, the systematic inquiry into the 
essence of which is among the fundamental tasks of general pheno­
menology.
It is in their actionality-modes that attentional formations have, in 
a pre-eminent manner, the characteristic of subjectiveness:29 and this 
characteristic is consequently acquired by all the30 functionings 
which become modalized by these modes or which, according to 
their specific sort, presuppose them. The ray of attention presents 
itself as emanating from the pure Ego and terminating in that which 
is objective, as directed to it or being diverted from it. The ray does 
not become detached from the Ego; on the contrary, it is itself an 
Ego-ray, and remains an Ego-ray. The “Object” is struck; it is the 
target, it is put into a relation to the Ego (and by the Ego itself) but is 
not “subjective.” A position-taking which bears the Ego-ray is, 
because of it, an act of the Ego itself; the Ego does or undergoes, is free 
or conditioned. The Ego, as we also said, “lives” in such acts. Its

living in them signifies, not the31 being of some “contents” or other 
in a stream of contents, but rather a multiplicity of describable 
manners in which the pure Ego, as the “free being” which it is, lives 
in certain intentive mental processes, those which have the universal 
modus cogito. But the expression, “as a free being,” indicates nothing 
else than such modes of living pertaining to freely going out of itself or 
freely withdrawing into itself, spontaneous doing, being somehow 
affected by the Objects, suffering, etc. W hat goes on in the stream of 
mental processes outside the Ego-ray or the cogito is essentially 
characterized otherwise; it lies outside the Ego’s actionality and 
yet, as we indicated earlier, it is appertinent to the Ego in so far as it is 
the field of potentiality for the Ego’s free acts.
So much by way of a general characterization of the noetic-noema- 
tic themes which must be treated with systematic thoroughness in the 
phenomenology of attention.32
<193) §93. Transition to the Noe tic-Noematic Structures of the Higher Spheres of 
Consciousness.
In the next series of considerations we wish to examine the structures 
which belong to the “higher” spheres of consciousness in which a 
number of noeses are built up on one another in the unity of a concrete mental 
process and in which, accordingly, the noematic correlates are likewise 
founded. Thus the eidetic law, confirmed in every case, states that 
there can be no noetic moment without a noematic moment specifically 
belonging to it.
31 Insertion in Copy I): merely
32 a i 't h o r 's  f o o tn o te : Attention is one of the chief themes of modern psychology. Nowhere 
does the predominantly sensualistic character of modern psychology show itself more strikingly 
than in the treatment of this theme, for not even the essential connection between attention and 
intentionality 
this fundamental fact: that attention of every sort is nothing else than a 
fundamental species of intentive modifications 
has ever, to my knowledge, been emphasized 
before. Since the appearance of the Logische Untersuchungen (see the statements in Part II, “Second 
Investigation," §§22t., pp. 159 165, and “Fifth Investigation" §19, p. 385 <[2nd ed., pp. 
160 166 and 405; English translation, pp. 381 386 and 584f. |> a few words are, to be sure, said 
occasionally about a connection between attention and “consciousness of objects” but, with 
lew exceptions I refer to the writings ofTheodor Lipps and Alexander Pfander), in a manner 
showing a lack ofunderstanding for the fact that what is in question here concerns the radically 
first beginning of the theory of attention and that the further investigation must be conducted 
within the limits oi intentionality and, moreover, not forthwith as an empirical, but first of all as 
.in eidetical investigation, <fIn Copy A forthwith as an empirical crossed out\>

Even in the case of noeses of a higher level33 — taken in concrete 
completeness — there at first emerges in the noematic composition a 
central core thrusting itself to the fore in a predominate way, the 
“meant Objectivity as Objectivity,” the Objectivity in inverted 
commas as required by the phenomenological reduction. There this 
central noema must also be taken precisely in the modified Objective 
composition in which it is just that noema, something intended to as 
intended to. Because the Objective something taken in a modified 
way itself becomes, to be sure, under the heading of sense, as, e.g., in 
our scientific investigation of it, again an Objective something al­
though of a dignity peculiar to it, one will subsequently see here that 
this novel Objectivity has its modes of givenness, its “characteristics,” its 
manifold modes with which it is intended to in the full noema 
pertaining to the noetic mental process or to the species of mental 
process in question. O f course, here again all the distinctions in the 
noema must also correspond to parallel distinctions in the unmodi­
fied Objectivity.
11 is then a further undertaking of more precise phenomenological 
study to discover what is prescribed according to eidetic law precisely 
by the species, and what is so prescribed by the differentiating 
particularities, for noemata of changing particularities of a fixed <194) 
species (e.g., perception). But the restriction holds throughout: in the 
sphere of essences there is nothing accidental; everything is connec­
ted by eidetic relations, thus especially noesis and noema.
§ 94. Noesis and Noema in the Realm of Judgment.
As an example from this sphere of founded essences let us consider the 
predicative judgment. The noema of the judging, i.e., of the concrete 
judgmental process, is the “judged as judged;” that, however, is 
nothing else, or at least with respect to its main core, it is nothing else 
than what we usually call simply the judgment.
If the full noema is to be seized upon, the judgm ent must be taken 
here in the full noematic concreteness intended to in the concrete 
judging. W hat is judged must not be confused with what is judged 
about. If the judging is based on perceiving or on some other simply 
‘"positing” objectivating, the noema of the objectivatinggoes into the

full concretion of the judgm ent34 (just as the objectivating noesis 
becomes an essential component of the concrete judgmental noesis) 
and takes on certain forms in the judging. That which is objectivated 
(as objectivated) receives the form of the apophantic subject, or that 
of the apophantic predicate, or some other such form. Here, for the 
sake of simplicity, let us disregard the higher stratum pertaining to 
verbal “expression.” These “objects about which,” especially the 
ones which take on <apophantic> subject <-forms> [Subjektge gens land] 
are the objects judged about. The whole which is formed out of them, 
the total What which is judged— and, moreover, taken precisely in the 
fashion (with the characterization, in the mode of givenness) in which it is 
“intended to” in the mental process — makes up the full noematic 
correlate, the “sense” (in the broadest signification of the word) of the 
judgm ental process. Stated more pregnantly, it is the “sense in the 
How ofits mode of givenness” in so far as this mode of givenness is to 
be found as a characteristic belonging to it.
In this connection, we must not overlook the phenomenological 
reduction which requires us to “parenthesize” the making of the 
judgment if we wish to acquire the pure noema of our judgmental 
process. If we do so, then we have in its phenomenological purity the 
full concrete essence of the judgmental process or, as we now express 
it, the judgment-noesis, taken concretely as an essence, and the judgment- 
noema belonging to and necessarily united with that noesis, the “ made 
judgment” as an Eidos, and it also in its phenomenological purity.

Psychologistic readers will object to all these statements; they are 
not inclined to distinguish between judging [Urteilen] as an empirical 
mental process and judging [Urteil]'6b as an “idea,” an essence. For us 
this distinction has already been thoroughly established. But the 
reader who accepts it will also be perplexed. For he is required to 
recognize that this one distinction is by no means sufficient and that it 
is necessary to fix a number of ideas which lie on two different sides 
within the essence of judgmental intentionality. It must above all be 
recognized that here, as in the case of any other intentive mental 
process, the two sides, noesis and noema, must by essential necessity 
be distinguished.
Critically it may be remarked here that the concepts of the “in­
tentive” and the “cognitional essence” which were established in the

Logische Untersuchungen36 are indeed correct but are capable of a 
second interpretation since they can be essentially understood as 
expressions not only of noetic but also of noematic essences, and that 
the noematic interpretation, as carried through there one-sidedly in 
framing the concept of the judgment in pure logic is precisely not the 
one to be used in framing the judgment-concept of pure logic (i.e., 
the concept demanded by pure logic as pure mathesis in contrast to 
the concept of noetic judging demanded by normative logical noe- 
tics). The difference between the making of a judgment and the judgment 
made, a difference already recognized in ordinary speech, can serve to 
point out the correct view, namely that to the judgmental mental 
process there belongs correlatively as noema /Ae judgm ent simpliciter.
The latter, then, should be understood as the “judgm ent” or 
proposition in the sense of the word in pure logic — except that pure logic is 
interested in the noema, not with respect to its components, but only 
in so far as it is conceived as exclusively determined by a narrower 
essence, to the more precise definition of which the above-mentioned 
attempt at a distinction in the Logische Untersuchungen pointed the way.
If we wish to obtain the full noema of a determinate judgmental 
process we must, as has already been said, take “ the” judgment 
precisely as it is intended to in just that process; whereas, for formal 
logic, the identity of “ the” judgm ent extends much further. An 
evident judgment, S is p, and “the same” judgm ent as a “ blind” 
judgment are noematically different but identical with respect to a 
core of sense which alone is decisive from the standpoint of formal 
logic. The difference here is similar to that already mentioned <196) 
between the noema of a perception and that of a parallel pre­
sentiation which intends to the same object, with precisely thesameset 
of determinations and with the same characterization (as “certainly 
existing,” “doubtfully existing,” or the like). The act-species are 
different, and there is wide room for phenomenological differences in 
other respects — but the37 noematic W hat is identical. Let us add 
that the idea of the judgment which has just been characterized and 
which functions as the fundamental concept in formal logic 'that 
discipline within mathesis universalis pertaining to predicative sig­
nifications) has as its correlate the noetic idea: “ the judgm ent” in a 
second sense understood, namely, as any judging whatever, with an
a i t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : CX op. ci(., Vol. II, Part One, “Fifth Investigation,”§21, pp. 3911'. <[2nd
pp. 417f.; English translation pp. 590f.)>
37 In Copy A changed to “ a ”

eidetic universality determined purely by the form. It is the funda­
mental concept in the formal noetic theory of correct judging.38
Everythingjust said is also true for other noetic mental processes; 
for example, it obviously holds good for all those which are essentially 
akin to judgings as predicative certainties: for the corresponding 
deemings possible, deemings likely, doubting, also rejectings. Among 
these the agreement can go so far that, in the noema, a sense-content 
occurs which is identical throughout and is merely furnished with 
<197) different “characterizations.” The same “ S is p,” as a noematic core, can 
be the “content” of a certainty, a deeming possible, a deeming likely, 
etc. In the noema the “S is p” does not stand alone; rather, as singled 
out of the noema by thinking, it is something non-selfsufficient; it is 
intended to with changing characterizations indispensable to the full 
noema: it is intended to with the characteristic of something “cer­
tain,” “possible,” “probable,” “null,” or the like — characteristics, 
to which the modifying inverted commas collectively belong and 
which, as correlates, are specifically coordinated with the noetic 
moments of considering-possible, considering-probable, consider- 
ing-null, and the like.
With this, as we see at the same time, two fundamental concepts of 
'[judgment-content” and likewise of likelihood-content, question- 
content, etc., are separated from one another. Not infrequently 
logicians use the term judgment-content in such a way that obviously
38a u t h o r ’s f o o r n o te : As for Bolzano’s concept of the “judgment in itself’ or “the proposition 
in itself,” the exposition in the Wissenschaftslehre (Sulzbach, 1837) shows that Bolzano had not 
made clear to himself the proper sense of his pioneer conception. He never saw that we have here 
two essentially possible interpretations, each of which yields something which might be called 
‘ ‘ t he j udgmen t i n i tself: ” t he specific essence of the j udging process (the noetic idea) and the noematic 
idea correlative to the noetic idea. His descriptions and explanations are ambiguous. Given a 
mathematician'sobjcctive interest, he undoubtedly had the noematic concept in mind —though 
an occasional phrase seems to indicate the contrary (cf. op. cit.. Vol. I, p. 95, the approving 
quotation from Mehmel’s Denklehre <scl. Versuch einer vollstandigen analytische Denklehreals Vorphilo- 
sophie und im Geiste der Philosophie (Erlangen, 1803)>). He had it in mind, precisely as the 
arithmetician has number in mind — being interested in operations with numbers but not in the 
phenomenological problem of the relationship between number and consciousness of number. 
Here in the sphere oflogic, as well as everywhere else, phenomenology was something quite alien to 
the great logician. That cannot fail to be clear to anyone who has actually studied Bolzano's
11 issenu haftslehre (which has unfortunately become so scarce) and who, in addition to that, is not 
inclined to confuse every working out of fundamental eidetic concepts 
the phenomenologi­
cally naive production 
with a phenomenological production. If one did this, then, in the 
interest ofconsistencyonewould have tosay that every mathematician whocreates concepts,e.g., 
Georg Cantor, as the genius who framed the fundamental concepts of the theory of sets, is a 
phenomenologist, including the unknown creator of the fundamental geometrical concepts in 
hoary antiquity.

(even though without the so necessary distinction) the noetic or the 
noematic-logical concept of judgm ent is meant, the two concepts 
which we previously characterized. The corresponding pairs of con­
cepts pertaining to likelihoods, questions, doubts, etc., run parallel 
with them, naturally without ever coinciding with them or with one 
another. Here, however, a second sense of judgment-content results
— as a “content” which the judgm ent <(or the judging)> can have 
identically in common with a likelihood (or a deeming likely), with a 
question (or an asking), and with other act-noemas or noeses.
§95. The Analogous Distinctions in the Emotional and Volitional Spheres.
Analogous statements hold, then, as one can easily see, for the 
emotional and volitional spheres, for mental processes of liking or 
disliking, of valuing in any sense, of wishing, deciding, acting. All 
these are mental processes which contain many and often hetero­
geneous intentive strata, the noetic and, correspondingly, also the 
noematic ones.
I n that connection, the stratifications, generally speaking, are such 
that the uppermost strata of the total phenomenon can be removed 
without the remainder ceasing to be a concretely complete intentive 
mental process,39 and, conversely, a concrete mental process can also 
take on a new noetic total stratum: as when a non-selfsufficient 
moment of “valuing” is stratified on a concrete process of simply 
objectivating or, on the other hand, is removed again.40
If, in this manner, a perceiving, phantasying, judging, or the like, < 198) 
founds a stratum of valuing which overlays it completely, we have 
different noemata or senses in the stratified whole which is called a concrete 
mental process of valuing by being designated according to the 
highest level within it. The perceived as perceived specifically be­
longs as sense to the perceiving, but it is also included in the sense of 
the concrete valuing, founding the latters’s sense. We must distinguish 
accordingly: the objects, the physical things, the qualities, the pre­
dicatively formed affair-complexes, which are present as valued in
39 Insertion in Copy A : (To be sure, the removal of an upper stratum effects a modification of the 
remainder, in spite ofits identity)

in Copy C: Still, with the removal, certain phenomenological modifications of the lower strata 
occur too.

the valuing, or else the corresponding noemata of the objectivatirigs, 
thejudgings, or the like, which found the value-consciousness; on the 
other hand, the value-objects themselves and the predicatively 
formed value-complexes themselves, or else the noematic modifica­
tions corresponding to them; and then, universally, the complete 
noemata belonging to the concrete value-consciousness.
By way of explanation let us say first of all that, for the sake of 
greater distinctness, we do well (here and in all analogous cases) to 
introduce distinctive relative terms in order to keep sharply separate 
valuable object and value-object, valuable predicatively formed 
affair-complex and predicatively formed value-complexes, valuable 
property and value-property ( a term having itself two senses). We 
shall speak of the mere “ thing” which is valuable, which has a value- 
characteristic, which has value-quality; in contradistinction, we speak 
of concrete value itself or the value-Objectiveness [ Wertobjektitdt J. Likewise 
we shall speak of the mere predicatively formed affair-complex or the mere 
lay of things [Sachlage J and the predicatively formed value-complex or the 
lay of values [ Wertlage/, namely where the valuing has a consciousness 
of a predicatively formed affair-complex as its founding substratum. 
The value-Objectiveness involves its mere materially determinate 
thing [Sache/; it introduces, as a new Objective stratum, the value- 
quality. The predicatively formed value-complex contains the mere 
predicatively formed affair-complex belonging to it; in like manner 
the value-property contains the materially determinate thing- 
property and, in addition the value-quality.
Here too one must distinguish between the value-Objectiveness 
simpliciter and the value-Objectiveness in inverted commas which is in­
cluded in the noema. Just as the perceived as perceived stands over 
against the perceiving in a way excluding the question of whether the 
perceived truly exists, so the valued as valued stands over against the 
valuing, and likewise in a way excluding the question of the being of 
the value (the being of the valued thing and the latter’s being truly a 
value). One must exclude all actional positings in order to seize upon 
the noema. Moreover, careful attention must be paid to the fact that 
the full “sense” of the valuing includes its W hat in which it is 
< 199) intended to in the mental process of valuing in question, and that the 
value-Objectiveness in inverted commas is not, by itself, the full 
noema.
In like manner the distinctions made here can be made in the
volitional sphere.

On one side we have the deciding which we effect together with the 
mental processes which it demands as a substratum, and which, 
when it is taken in its concreteness, it includes. To it belong many 
different noetic moments. Volitional positings are based on valuing 
positings, physical-thing positings, and the like. On the other side we 
find the decision as a peculiar kind of Objectiveness specifically be­
longing to the province of volition; and it is an Objectiveness obvi­
ously founded on other such noematic Objectivenesses. If, as pheno- 
menologists, we exclude all our positings, the volitional pheno­
menon, as a phenomenologically pure intentive mental process, still 
retains its “willed as willed,” as a noema belonging peculiarly to the willing: 
the “volition-meaning,” precisely as it is a “meaning” in this willing (in 
the full essence <of the willing)) and with everything being willed and 
“aimed at.”
We said, “ the meaning.” This word suggests itself in all these 
contexts, just as do the words “sense” and “signification.” To the 
meaning [Meinen\ or intending to \Vermeinen], then, corresponds the 
meant [Meinung]; to signifying, the signification. But the greatest 
precaution is called for with respect to these words because they all 
have been infected with so many equivocations by transference, not 
least of all by equivocations which arise from slipping from one to 
another of the correlative strata which we are trying to separate with 
scientific rigor. The scope of our present observations is the broadest 
extension of the essential genus, “ intentive mental process.” 
“M eaning,” on the other hand, is normally spoken of in referring to 
narrower spheres which,, however, function as substrata for other 
phenomena in the wider sphere. As technical terms, therefore, this 
word and cognate expressions should be used only with reference to 
those narrower spheres. In referring to the universalities involved, we 
are undoubtedly better served by our new terms and the attached 
analyses of examples.
§96. Transition to Further Chapters. Concluding Remarks.
We have bestowed such great care on working out universally the 
difference between noesis (i.e., the concretely complete intentive 
mental process, designated by a name emphasizing its noetic compo­
nents) and noema because the seizing upon and mastering it are of <200) 
the greatest importance for phenomenology, are indeed decisive for

the legitimate grounding of phenomenology. At first glance it would 
seem to be something obvious: Any consciousness is a consciousness of 
something, and the modes of consciousness are highly diversified. On 
approaching more closely, however, we became sensible of the great 
difficulties involved. They concern our understanding of the mode of 
being of the noema, the way in which it is “implicit” in the mental 
process, in which it is “intended to” in the mental process. Quite 
particularly they concern the clean separation of those things which, 
as its really inherent components, belong to the mental process itself 
and those which belong to the noema, which must be assigned to the 
noema as its own <components>. Subsequently the correct analysis of 
the parallel structures of noesis and noema involves considerable 
difficulties. Even when we have succeeded in making some of the 
major relevant distinctions in examining the objectivatings and 
judgings, where they are first presented and for which logic has done 
valuable though far from adequate preliminary work, some effort 
and self-control is needed in order to actually make the parallel dis­
tinctions clearly given in the case of emotional acts, instead of only 
postulating and asserting them.
Here, in the context of our merely introductory meditations, we 
cannot undertake to develop parts of phenomenology systematically. 
Nevertheless, our aims require that we go into things more deeply 
than we have up to now and project the, beginnings of such in­
vestigations. That is necessary in order to make noetic-noematic 
structures clear enough so that their significance for the problems 
and methods of phenomenology may become understandable. A 
detailed idea of the fruitfulness of phenomenology, the magnitude of 
its problems and the nature of its procedure is only achieved by 
actually entering province after province and seeing the extent of the 
relevant problems. But any such province is actually entered and 
becomes sensible as a field for solid work only when one makes the 
phenomenological distinctions and clarifications by which alone 
the sense of the problems to be solved in it can become under­
standable. O ur further analyses and exhibitions of problems will be 
strictly confined to this style, as our previous efforts have been in part. 
However complicated the matters treated may seem to the novice, 
still we shall consider only restricted spheres. Naturally we shall 
<201) give preference to what is relatively close to the gates of phenome­
nology and to what is unconditionally necessary in order to trace 
main systematic lines extending throughout the realm. All of it is hard

and requires laborious concentration on the data of specifically pheno­
menological eidetic intuition. There is no “royal road” into 
phenomenology and therefore none into philosophy. There is only 
the one road prescribed by phenomenology’s own essence.
Finally, the following remark would seem to be in order. 
Phenomenology is presented in our exposition as a beginning science. 
How many of the results of the analyses undertaken here are de­
finitive, only the future can tell. Certainly much of what we have 
described will have to be described otherwise sub specie aeterni. But 
one thing we may and must strive for: that at each step we faithfully 
describe what we, from our point of view and after the most serious 
study, actually see. O ur procedure is that of an explorer journeying 
through an unknown part of the world, and carefully describing 
what is presented along his unbeaten paths, which will not always 
be the shortest. Such an explorer can rightfully be filled with the sure 
confidence that he gives utterance to what, at the time and under the 
circumstances, must be said — something which, because it is the 
faithful expression of something seen, will always retain its value — 
even though new explorations will require new descriptions with 
manifold improvements. With a like conviction, in the sequel we 
propose to be faithful describers of phenomenological structures and, 
moreover, to preserve the habit of inner freedom even with respect to 
our own descriptions.

§97. The Hyletic and Noetic Moments as Really Inherent Moments, the 
Noematic Moments as Really Non-inherent Moments, of Mental Processes.
When introducing the distinction between the noetic and the noema­
tic in the last chapter, we used the expressions, analysis of the really 
inherent and intentional analysis. Let us start with that. A phenomeno- 
logically pure mental process has its really inherent components. For 
the sake of simplicity, let us restrict ourselves to noetic mental 
processes of the lowest level, namely1 to those which are not com­
plicated in their intentionality by a variety of noetic strata built one 
upon another such as we found to be the case in acts of thinking and 
in emotional and volitional acts.
A sensuous perception may possibly 3erve as an example: the 
tree-perception simpliciter which we have while looking out into the 
<202) garden when, in a unity of consciousness, we are looking at that tree 
over there which is now motionless and then appears blown by the 
wind, and which is also presented in greatly differing modes of 
appearance as we, during our continuing observation, change our 
spatial position relative to the tree — perhaps we go to the window or 
simply alter the position of our head or eyes, while perhaps at the 
same time relaxing and concentrating our <visual> accomodation, 
etc. In this way the unity of one perception can include a great 
multiplicity of modifications which we, as observers in the natural 
attitude, sometimes ascribe to the actual objects as its changes, 
sometimes to a real and actual relationship to our real psychophysical 
subjectivity and sometimes, finally, to the latter itself. But now we 
must describe what is left of that as a phenomenological residuum if

we reduce it to its “pure immanence” and what therefore may or may 
not hold good for the really inherent component of the pure mental process. And 
here it must be made perfectly clear that, more particularly, there 
belongs to the essence of the mental process of perception in itself the 
“perceived tree as perceived,” or the full noema, which is not 
touched by excluding the actuality of the tree and that of the whole 
world; on the other hand, however, this noema, with its “tree” in 
inverted commas, is no more contained inherently than is the tree which 
belongs to actuality.
W hat do we find really inherent in <the perception> as pure mental 
process, contained in it as the parts, the pieces and the moments not 
divisible into pieces, of a whole? We have, on occasion, distinguished 
such genuine really inherent component parts by the names stuff- 
component parts and noetic component parts. Let us contrast them 
with the noematic components.
The color of the tree trunk, pure as the color of which we are 
perceptually conscious, is precisely the “same” as the one which, 
before the phenomenological reduction, we took to be the color of the 
actual tree (at least as “natural” human beings and prior to inter­
vention of information provided by physics). Now, this color, put into 
parenthesis, belongs to the noema. But it does not belong to the 
mental process of perception as a really inherent component piece, 
although we can also find in it “something like color:” namely, the 
“sensed color,” that hyletic moment of the concrete mental process 
by which the noematic, or “objective,” color is “adumbrated.”
Accordingly, however, one and the same noematic color which is 
intended to throughout the continuous unity of changeable per­
ceptual consciousness as an identical and, in itself, unchanged color, <203) 
is being adumbrated by a continuous multiplicity of sensed colors.
We see a tree unchanged with respect to color — its color, the color of 
the tree — while the positions of the eyes <and our> relative orientat­
ions are changing^ and our regard is incessantly moving over the 
trunk and branches, and while, at the same time, we come closer and 
thus, in various ways, bring the mental process of perception into a 
flow. Let us reflect on sensations, on adumbrations: we then seize 
upon them as evident data and, in perfect evidence, changing the 
focus and direction of attention, we can also relate them and the 
corresponding objective moments, cognize them as corresponding 
and, in so doing, see at once that, e.g., the adumbrative colors 
pertaining to any fixed physical-thing color are related to it as a

continuous “multiplicity” is related to a “unity.” 2
Effecting the phenomenological reduction, we even acquire the 
generical eidetic insight that the object, tree, can only appear at all in a 
perception as Objectively determined in the mode in which it does 
appear in the perception if the hyletic moments (or, in the case of a 
continuous series of perceptions, if the continuous hyletic changes) 
are just those and no others. This therefore implies that any changes3 
of the hyletic content of the perception, if it does not quite do away 
with perceptual consciousness, must at least result in what appears 
becoming objectively “other,” whether in itself or in the orientation 
in which it is appearing, or the like.
It is also absolutely indubitable, then, that here “unity” and 
“multiplicity” belong to wholly different dimensions and, more part­
icularly, that everything hyletic belongs in the concrete mental process 
as a really inherent component, whereas, in contrast, what is “presen­
ted,” “adum brated,” in it as multiplicity belongs in the noema.4
But the stuffs, we said earlier, are “anim ated” by noetic moments; 
they undergo (while the Ego is turned, not to them, but to the object) 
“construings,” “sense-bestowals,” which, in reflections, we seize 
upon precisely in and along with the stuffs. In view of this it im­
mediately follows that not only the hyletic moments (the sensed 
colors, sounds, etc.), but also the animating construals — thus both 
together: the appearing of the color, the sound and thus of any quality 
<204) whatever of the object — belong to the “really inherent” com­
position of the mental process.
Now, the following is universally true: In itself the perception is a 
perception of its object; and to every component which is singled out 
in the object by “objectively” directed description there correspond 
a really inherent component of the perception; but, note well, only in 
so far as the description faithfully conforms to the object as it “is there” 
in that perception itself. Moreover, we can designate all those noetic 
components only by appealing to the noematic Object and its mo­
ments: thus saying, for example, consciousness, more particularly, 
perceptual consciousness, of a tree trunk, of the color of the trunk, etc.

4 Marginal note to this paragraph in Copy A: Indeed, relatively: the hylctic Datum is, after all, 
itself a unity, but, to be sure, an immanental, subjectively really inherent one; on the other 
hand, behind it, something subjective of a higher level, something subjective constituting that 
unity.

On the other hand, our considerations have shown indeed that the 
really inherent unity within the mental process of hyletic and noetic 
component pieces is totally different from the <unity> of noematic 
component pieces “intended to” in the noesis; and it is also different 
from the unity which unites all those really inherent components in 
the mental process with that whereof, as a noema, we are conscious in 
and through them. That which is “transcendentally constituted” “on the 
ground o f’ the material [stofflich] mental processes “by” the noetic 
functions is, to be sure, something “given;” ’ and in pure intuition we 
faithfully describe the mental process and its noematic object intend­
ed to [sein noematisch Bewufites], it is something evidently given; but it 
belongs to the mental process in a sense entirely different from the 
sense in which the really inherent and therefore proper constituents 
belong to the mental process.
The characterization of the phenomenological reduction and, 
likewise, of the pure sphere of mental processes as “transcendental” 
rests precisely on the fact that we discover in this reduction an 
absolute sphere of stuffs and noetic forms whose determinately struc­
tured combinations possess, according to immanental eidetic necessity, the 
marvelous consciousness of something determinate and deter­
minable, given thus and so, which is something over against consci­
ousness itself, something fundamentally other, non-really inherent 
[Irreelles\, transcendent; <the characterization of mental processes as 
“transcendental” further rests on the fact> that this is the primal 
source in which is found the only conceivable solution of those 
deepest problems of cognition concerning the essence and possibility 
of an objectively valid knowledge of something transcendent. 
“Transcendental” reduction exercises the 
with respect to
actuality: but what it retains of<actuality> includes the noemas with 
the noematic unity included within them themselves and, accord­
ingly, the mode in which something real is intended to and, in 
particular, given in consciousness itself. The knowledge that 
everywhere it is a m atter of eidetic, therefore unconditioned, necessary 
concatenations opens up a great field of research into the eidetic <205) 
relations between the noetic and the noematic, between the mental 
process of consciousness and the correlate of consciousness. The latter 
term, however, includes: consciousness ofobjectivity as consciousness 
ofobjectivity and, at the same time, the forms of the noematic How of 
mcantness of givenness. Within the domain from which we have 
taken our example, there arises, first of all, the universal evidence

that perception is not an empty presentive having of the object, but 
that instead it belongs (“a priori” ) to the essence proper of percep­
tion to have “its” object, and to have it as the unity of a certain 
noematic composition which is always a different, yet always eidet­
ically predelineated composition in the case of other perceptions of 
“ the same” object; or that it is of the essence of the object in question, 
objectively determined thus and so, to be and only to be able to be a 
noematic object precisely in perceptions of such a descriptive sort, 
etc.5
§98. The Mode of Being of the Noema. Theory of Forms of Noeses. Theory of 
Forms of Noemata .6
Im portant supplementations are still, however, necessary. First ofall, 
it must be carefully noted that any transition from a phenomenon 
into the reflection which itself is an analysis of the really inherent, or 
into the quite differently articulated <reflection> which dissects its 
noema, generates new phenomena, and that we would fall into error 
were we to confuse the new phenomena — which, in a certain way, 
are recastings of the old — with the old phenomena, and were we to 
impute to the old what really inherently or noematically is included in 
the <new>. Thus it is not meant, e.g., that the material contents, let us 
say the adumbrative color-contents, are present in the perceptual 
mental process in just the same way in which they are present in the 
mental process of analyzing. To mention only one difference,> in the 
former they were contained as really inherent moments, but they 
were not perceived therein, not seized upon as objects. But in the 
analyzing mental process they are objects, targets of noetic functions 
which were not present before. Although these stuffs are still laden 
with their presentive functions, even these have undergone essential 
changes (to be sure, of other dimensions). That will be discussed later. 
Obviously, this difference has an essential importance for the pheno­
menological method.

Addition in Copy A: Naturally all of this is true in the case of perceptions in the very broadest 
sense and not merely in the case of perceptions of physical things. It holds for all originarily 
presentive acts: To each fundamental kind of objectivity there corresponds an eidetically 
appertinent fundamental kind of constitutive <consciousness> originaliter — i.e., consciousness 
presentive originaliter of just that <objectivity> and no other 
and eidetically this conscious­
ness has its quite determinate structures the exploration of which is the task.
6Marginal note in Copy D to Title:?

Following this remark let us turn our attention to the following 
points belonging to our particular theme. In the first place, every <206) 
mental process is so structured that there exists the essential possibil­
ity of turning one’s regard to it and its really inherent components 
and, likewise, in the opposite direction to the noema, perchance to 
the seen tree as seen. That which is given in this focusing of regard is 
now, more particularly, stated logically, an object, but utterly non­
selfsufficient. Its esse consists exclusively ofits “percipi” — except that 
this proposition does not have the Berkeleyian sense because here the 
esse does not include the percipi as a really inherent component 
piece.
This is naturally transferred to the eidetic mode of consideration: 
the Eidos of the noema points to the Eidos of the noetic consciousness; 
both belong together eidetically. The intentive as intentive [Intentionale 
als solches] is what it is as the intentiveness [Intentionales] belonging to 
consciousness structured thus and so, consciousness which is conscious­
ness of it.
In spite of this non-selfsufficiency the noema allows for being 
considered by itself, compared with other noemas, explored with 
respect to its possible transformations, etc. One7 can project a theory of 
the universal and pure forms of noemata which would have as its contrast­
ing correlate a theory of the universal and no less pure forms of concrete 
noetic mental processes with their hyletic and specifically noetic components.
Naturally these two theories would by no means be related as, so to 
speak, mutual reflections; nor would the one be transformed into the 
other by a mere change of sign, let us say, by substituting “conscious­
ness of N ” for each noema N. That already follows from what we 
explained before in connection with the way in which unitary qual­
ities belong together in the physical thing — noema with their hyletic 
adumbration-multiplicities contained in possible perceptions of 
physical things.8
It would now seem as though the same would also be true with 
respect to the specifically noetic moments. More particularly, one 
can refer to those moments which bring it about that a complex 
multiplicity of hyletic Data, e.g., color-Data, etc., acquire the func-

tion of a manifold adumbration of one and the same objective 
physical thing. Indeed, it only need be recalled that in the stuffs 
themselves, by virtue of their own essence, the relation to the 
Objective unity is not unambiguously predelineated; the same 
material complex, instead, can undergo a diversity of mutually 
discrete and shifting construings by virtue of which different ob- 
<207) jectivities are intended to. Is it not therefore already clear that 
essential differences lie in the animating construings themselves as moments of 
mental processes, and which are differentiated along with the atten­
dant adumbrations and by virtue of the animation of which they 
constitute “sense”? One may therefore draw the following conclu­
sion: A parellelism between noesis and noema is indeed the case, but it 
is such that one must describe the formations on both sides and in their 
essentially mutual correspondence. The noematic is the field of 
unities, the noetic is the field of “constituting” multiplicities. The 
consciousness which unities the manifold “functionally” and, at the 
same time, constitutes unity never in fact shows an identity9 even where 
an identity of the “object” is given in the noematic correlate. Where, 
for example, different segments of an enduring perceiving which is 
constituting a physical-thing unity shows something identical, the one 
tree unchanging according to the sense of this perceiving — given 
now in this, then in that orientation, now from the front, now from 
the back, at first indistinctly and indeterminately, then distinctly and 
determinately with respect to the properties of one or another place 
seized upon visually — : there the object found in the noema is 
intended to as an identical object in the literal sense, but the consci­
ousness of it is a non-identical, only combined, continuously united 
consciousness in the different segments ofits immanental duration.
No matter to what extent these statements contain something 
right, the conclusions drawn are still not wholly correct; indeed, the 
greatest caution is required in dealing with these difficult questions. 
The parallelisms obtaining here — and there are many which are only 
too easily confused with one another — involve great difficulties 
which are still in need of clarification. We must carefully keep in view 
the difference between concrete noetic mental processes, the mental 
processes together with their hyletic moments, and the pure noeses as 
mere complexes of noetic moments. Again, we must preserve the
9 
Insertion in Copy A: in the different phases and adumbrations belonging to perceptions of the 
same

distinction between the full noema and, e.g., in the case of percep­
tion, the “ appearing object as appearing.” If we take this “object” 
and all its objective “predicates” — the noematic modifications of 
the predicates of the perceived physical thing, posited in normal 
perception simply as actual predicates — then this object and these 
predicates are indeed unities in contradistinction to multiplicities of 
constituting mental processes of consciousness (concrete noeses). But 
they are also unities of noematic multiplicities. We recognize that as <208) 
soon as we take into consideration the noematic characterizations of 
the noematic “object” (and its “predicates” ), characterizations 
which until now we have grossly neglected. Thus it is certain, for 
instance, that the appearing color is a unity in contradistinction to 
noetic multiplicities and, specifically, multiplicities of noetic 
construing-characteristics. But more precise investigations reveal 
that changes in these characteristics correspond to noematic parallels
— if not in the “color itself,” which continues to appear there, then at 
least in their changing “modes of givenness,” e.g., in their appearing 
“orientation with respect to me.” In this way, then noetic” character­
izations” are mirrored in the noematic ones.
How that is the case, and not simply for the sphere of perception 
emphasized here by way of example, must now become a theme of 
comprehensive analyses. We shall analyze in sequence the different 
kinds of consciousness with their many different noetic character­
istics and explore them with respect to their notic-noematic parallels.
In advance, however, we must impress upon ourselves that the 
parallelism between the unity of the object noematically “meant” in such and 
such a way, the unity of the object in the “sense,” and the constituting 
formations of consciousness (“ordo et connexio rerum — ordo et 
eonnexio idearum”) must not be confused with the parallelism between noesis 
and noema, understood more particularly as the parallelism of noetic 
and corresponding noematic characteristics.
The following considerations concern the latter parallelism.
§99. The Noematic Core and Its Characteristics in the Sphere of Original 
Presentations and Presentations.
It is our task, therefore, to considerably broaden the sphere of what 
has been exhibited in the two parallel series of noetic and noematic 
events in order to arrive at the full noema and the full noesis. W hat

previously we had in view, although without suspecting the great 
problems it contains, is indeed only a central core and, in addition, 
not even an unambiguously delimited one.
Let us recall,10 in the first place, that “objective sense” which, by 
<209) comparing the noemata of different sorts of objectivations, of per­
ceptions, of memories, picture-objectivations, and the like, previ­
ously proved to be something describable exclusively with Objective 
expressions and even with identical ones in the preferentially 
chosen limiting cases in which a wholly like object — oriented in a 
like way, apprehended in a like way in every respect — e.g., a tree, is 
presented perceptually, memorially, pictorially, etc. In contrast to 
the identical “appearing tree as appearing,” with its identical 
“Objective” How of appearing, there remain the differences in modes 
of givenness varying from one kind of intuition to another kind and in 
accordance with other sorts of objectivation.
That which is identical is at one time intended to “orginarily,” at 
another time “memorially,” then “pictorially,” etc. In that connec­
tion, however, characteristics, found when one’s regard is directed to the 
noematic correlate and not to the mental process and its really 
inherent composition, are indicated in the “appearing tree as appear­
ing.” Expressed, accordingly, are not “modes of consciousness” in the 
sense of noetic moments, but rather modes in which the object itself 
intended to and as intended to is given. As characteristics belonging to 
what is, so to speak, “ideally inherent” [“Ideelien”], they are them­
selves “ideal” [“ideell”] and not really inherent.
Upon more precise analysis one observes that the characteristics 
mentioned as examples do not belong to a single series.
On the one side we have the reproductive modification simpliciter, 
the presentation simpliciter, which, in its own essence, remarkably 
enough, is given as modification of something else. Presentiation refers 
back to perception in its own peculiar phenomenological essence; 
e.g., as we have already noted before, remembering something past 
implies “having perceived;” thus in a certain fashion the “corre­
sponding” perception (perception of the same sense-core) is intended 
to in the memory, although it is not actually contained in it. Precisely 
in its own peculiar essence, memory is a “modification o f’ per­
ception. Correlatively, what is characterized as past in itself is presen­
ted as “having been present,” thus as a modification of the “present”

which as the unmodified, is precisely the “originary,” the “present in 
person” of the perception.
On the other side, \hzpictorializing modification belongs to another 
series of modifications. It presentiates “in” a “picture.” However, the 
picture can be an originarily appearing one, e.g., the “painted” 
picture which we seize upon perceptually (obviously not the painting 
as physical 
of which it is said, e.g., that it hangs on the wall11). But <210) 
the picture can also be something which appears reproductively, as 
when we have picture-objectivations in memory or in free phantasy.12
At the same time one observes that the characteristics of this new 
series are not only related back to the first series, but also presuppose 
combinations: the latter <presupposed> with reference back to the 
difference between “picture” and “depictured” which noematically 
belongs to the essence of consciousness. One sees too, on that account, 
that here the noema always includes a pair of characteristics which 
refer to one another even though they include differing objects as 
objects of objectivatings.
Finally, sign-objectivations, with their analogous opposites of sign 
and designated, offer us a closely related and nonetheless new type of 
modifying noematic characteristics (to which, as everywehere, there 
correspond parallel noetic characteristics); accordingly, again com­
binations of objectivations occur, and, as correlates of their own 
peculiar unity as sign-objectivations, pairs of characterizations 
which belong together noematically occur in the noematic object- 
pairs.
One also notes that just as the “picture” [“jBiW”] in itself, accord­
ing to its sense as image [Bild], is given as the modification of 
something which, without this modification would be there itself 
simply as “in person” or as presentiated, so the “sign” <is given>, but, 
in its fashion, likewise as the modification of something.
§100. Eidetically Lawful Hierarchical Formations of Objectivations in the 
Noesis and Noema.
All the types ofobjectivation-modifications previously dealt with are 
always accessible for always newer hierarchical formations of such a
11 a u t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : On this difference, cf. below, §111, p. 226.

in memory, a painting stands “before our eyes,” and the like

kind that the intentionalities in the noesis and noema are hierarchically 
built up on one another or, rather, in a unique way, encased in one 
another.
There are presentiations simpliciter, modifications simpliciter of per- 
ceptions. But there are also presentiations of a secondy third and, essentiallyy 
of any level whatever. Rememberings “in5 5 rememberings will serve as 
an example. Living in the remembering we “effect” a concatenation 
of mental processes in the mode of presentiation. We persuade 
ourselves of this by reflecting “in” the remembering (which, for its 
1 > part, is a presentiation-modification of an originary reflecting), and 
we then find the concatenations of mental processes characterized as 
memorially “having been lived.” W hether we reflect on them or not, 
among mental processes characterized that way rememberings can 
themselves now occur characterized as “rememberings having been 
lived,” and the regard can be directed through them to the remem­
bered at the second level. In the secondarily modified concatenation 
of mental processes, rememberings can arise once again, and thus 
idealiter in infinitum.
A mere change of sign (the own specific peculiarity of which we 
must yet learn to understand) translates all of these events into the 
type, free phantasy, so that phantasyings into phantasyings are 
yielded, and this at any level of encasement.
Moreover, there are then mixtures of them. It is not only the case 
that each presentiation, according to its essence, with respect to the 
next level below it, includes presentiation-modifications of perceptions 
which become the object of a seizing regard by the wonderful 
<process> of reflection in presentiation; in the unity of the 
presentiation-phenomenon we can find at the same time, besides 
presentiations of perceptions, presentiations of rememberings, 
expectations, phantasyings, etc., whereby the presentiations in ques­
tion can be themselves of any of these types. And all of this <is found> 
at different levels.
This also holds for the types of combinations, depictive objectivation 
and sign-objectivation. Let us take an example with a very complicated 
and yet easily understandable objectivation-formation belonging to 
objectivations of higher level. A name reminds us, namingly, of the 
Dresden Gallery and of our last visit there: we walk through the halls 
and stand before a picture by Teniers which represents a picture 
gallery. If, let us say, we allow that pictures in the latter would 
represent again pictures which, for their part, represent legible

inscriptions, and so forth, then we can estimate which inclusion of 
objectivations and which mediacies are actually produceable with 
respect to objectivities which can be seized upon. But such very 
complicated examples are not required for eidetic insights, in par­
ticular for the insight into the ideal possibility for continuing ad 
libitum the encasement of one objectivation into another.
§101. Characteristics of Levels. Different Sorts of “Reflections ”
It is clear that in all those kinds of hierarchical structures which 
contain reiterated presentiation-modifications in their members, <212) 
noemas with a corresponding hierarchical formation are constituted. In the 
consciousness of a depicturing at the second level a “picture” in itself 
is characterized as a picture at the second level, as picture of a 
picture. If we recall how yesterday we remembered a childhood 
experience, then the noema, “childhood experience,” in itself has a 
characterization as something remembered at the second level. Thus 
in general:
To every noematic level there belongs a characteristic appropriate to 
that level as a kind of index with which each thing characterized 
manifests itself as belonging to its level — whether it would otherwise 
be a primary object or one lying in some line or other of the reflective 
regard. For indeed to every level belong possible reflections at that level, so 
that, e.g., with respect to remembered things at the second level of 
remembering, <there are> reflections on perceivings of just these 
things belonging to the same level (thus presentiated at the second 
level).
Furthermore: each noematic level is an “objectivation” “of" the 
data of the following <level>. “Objectivation” does not signify here, 
however, the objectivation-process, and the “of” does not express 
here the relation of consciousness and the Object of consciousness. It 
is, as it were, a noematic in contrast to a noetic intentionality,13 The latter 
includes in itself the former as its consciousness-correlate, and its 
intentionality, in a certain way, goes clear through the line of 
noematic intentionality.
This will become more distinct when we allow the Ego’s attentive
13 
Marginal comment in Copy A: Dubious, and to be more precisely characterized as a relative 
way of speaking

regard to be directed to the consciousness of something objective. 
The <Ego’s regard> then goes straight through the noemata of the 
sequence of levels — until it arrives at the Object of the ultimate deveb 
beyond which it cannot go, but upon which, instead, it fixes. The 
regard can, however, shift from level to level, and instead of going 
through all of them it is rather directed to the data of that level upon 
which it fixes; it <can do this> either in a “straightforwardn' or in a 
reflective direction of regard.
In the previous example: the regard can remain at the level of the 
Dresden Gallery — “rememberingly” we walk through the Gallery 
in Dresden. Then we can, again within memory, live in the observa­
tion of pictures and find ourselves in the world of pictures. After this, 
adverted to the gallery of paintings in picture consciousness of the 
second level, we look at the paintings themselves; or we reflect 
hierarchically upon the noeses, etc.14 
This multiplicity of possible 
<213) directions of the regard essentially belongs to the multiplicity of 
intentionalities related to and founded in one another; and wherever 
we find analogous founding relationships — and in what follows we 
will become acquainted with many very different kinds — analogous 
possibilities of changing reflection are brought out.
It need not be said that these relations require scientifically detail­
ed explorations with respect to their essence.
§102. Transition to New Dimensions of Characterizations.
With respect to all of the specifically peculiar characterizations 
which we encountered in complex domains of modifications through 
presentiations, we must clearly distinguish, on grounds already in­
dicated, between the noetic and the noematic. The noematic “ob­
jects” — the picture-Object, or the depictured Object, the <Object> 
functioning as sign and the designated <Object>, disregarding the 
characterizations belonging to them such as “picture for,” “depic­
tured,” “sign for,” “designated” — are unities transcendent to, but 
evidentially intended to in, the mental process. But if that is the case, 
then characteristics,15 which arise in <those unities> for consciousness 
and which are seized upon as their properties in focusing the regard on 
them, cannot possibly be regarded as really inherent moments of the

Marginal note to this sentence in Copy A: The entire concept of the noetic is problematic simply

mental process. No m atter how difficult the problems may still be in 
how both — that which is a really inherent composition of the mental 
process and that which is intended to in the mental process as not 
really inherent in it — may stand with respect to one another, we 
must make the differentiation throughout. More particularly, <we 
must make it> not only with respect to the noematic core, the 
“intentional object as intentional” (and taken in its “Objective” 
modes of givenness), which emerges in the particular case as the 
bearer of the noematic “characteristics,” but also as well with respect 
to the characteristics themselves.
There are, however, still quite different sorts of characteristics 
which always attach to the noematic core, and the ways in which 
they pertain to <the core> are very different. They find their place 
within fundamentally different genera, within, so to speak, fundamentally 
different dimensions of characterization. On that account, it may be 
pointed out at the very beginning that all of the characteristics 
suggested here or still to be suggested (mere headings of necessary 
analytic-descriptive research) are of all-embracing phenomenological 
scope. When we also deal with them immediately, primarily in the 
case of the relatively simplest structured mental processes which 
comprise a determined and fundamental concept of “objectivation ” 
and which make up necessary foundations for all other intentive <214) 
mental processes, then these same fundamental genera and species of 
characteristics are also to be found among all these founded and, 
therefore, among all intentive mental processes whatever. The situation is 
such that, accordingly, always and necessarily a noematic core, an 
“object-noema,” is intended to which must be characterized in some 
manner and, moreover, according to this or that (on its side, 
exclusive) species in each genus.
§103. Belief-characteristics and Being-characteristics.
If we look about for new characteristics we notice, first of all, that 
being-characteristics are combined with those obviously totally differ­
ent characteristics we dealt with before. As noetic characteristics 
related to correlative modes of being — “doxic” or “belief- 
characteristics” — we find perceptual belief and, sometimes, to be sure, 
perceptual certainty, really inherently included in intuitive objec­
tivations, e.g., in those of normal perceptions as “attentive percep-

tions;” corresponding to <perceptual certainty> as its noematic corre­
late belonging to the appearing object is the being-characteristic: 
“actual.” The same noetic or noematic characteristic is shown by 
“certain” representation, by every sort of “sure” mindfulness of 
something which was, or is now, or which will be in the future (as in 
the case of anticipated expectation). They are being- ‘positing,” “posit­
ional'” acts. To be sure, we must note concerning this expression that 
if it refers also to an actus, to a position-taking in a specific sense, 
precisely this is left out of consideration.
In the sphere considered up to now, that which appears perceptu­
ally or memorially had the characteristic of “ actually” existing 
simpliciter — of “certainly” existing as we also say in contrast to 
other being-characteristics. For this characteristic can become 
modified; it can become transformed, perhaps, in the same pheno­
menon by actual modifications, The mode of “certain” belief can 
change into the mode of mere deeming possible or deeming likelyy or 
questioning and doubting; and, as the case may be, that which appears 
(and which, with regard to the first dimension of characterizations is 
characterized as “originary,” “reproductive,” and the like has taken 
on now the being-modalities of “possible” of probable yyy of “ questionable” 
of “doubtful ”
For example: at first a perceived object is there with simple 
(215) unquestionedness, in certainty. Suddenly we suspect that we may 
have fallen victim to a mere “illusion,” we suspect that what is seen, 
heard, and the like, may be “mere semblance.” O r what is appearing 
keeps its being-certainty, but we are unsure about some deter­
minational complex or other. The thing “suggests itself’ as possibly a 
man. Then a contrary deeming possible occurs: it could be a tree 
which, in the darkness of the forest, looks like a man who is moving. 
Now, however, the “weight” of the one “possibility” becomes con­
siderably greater; we decide in its favor, perhaps in the manner in 
which we definitely deem it likely that “it was a tree after all.”
Being-modalities likewise change even more frequently in memory 
and, more particularly, they change such that, in a large measure, 
they are set up and replaced within the bounds of intuitions, or of 
obscure objectivations, without the participation of any “thinking” 
in the specific sense, without a “concept” and predicative judgment.
At the same time, one sees that the relevant phenomena suggest 
various studies, that many further characteristics (like “ decided ” 
“weights” of possibilities, and the like) make their appearance here,

and that, in particular, the question about the essential foundations 
of the various characteristics, the question about the whole structure 
of noemas and noeses governed by eidetic laws, also requires pro­
founder investigations.
And here, as elsewhere, it is sufficient to have brought out16 the 
group of problems.
§104. The Doxic Modalities as Modifications.
But with respect to the series of belief-modalities specifically occupy­
ing us, we must still point out that, in the pre-eminent specific intentional 
sense of the word, modification again finds the application which we 
made distinct for ourselves in the analysis of the previous series of 
noetic or noematic characteristics. In the present series belief- 
certainty obviously plays the role of the unmodified or, as we had to 
say here, the “unmodalized” primal form of the mode of believing. Corre­
latively, in the correlate: the being-characteristic simpliciter (the 
noematically “certain” or “actually” existing) functions as the primal 
form <from which all being-modalities <are derived>. I n fact, all of the being- 
characteristics originating from it, the ones, to be specifically called 
being-modalities, have in their own sense a relation back to the 
primal form. In itself “possible” is tantam ount to “ possibly existing;” 
“probable,” “doubtful,” “questionable” are tantam ount to “prob- <216) 
ably existing,” “doubtfully and questionably existing.” The in­
tentionality of the noeses is mirrored in these noematic respects 
\Beziehungen], and one feels oneself forced to speak again even of a 
“ noematic intentionality” as a “parallel” of the noetic <intentionality>, 
which is <intentionality> properly so called.
All of this is transferred to the full “posita ” i.e., to the unities of 
sense-core and being-characteristic.17.
It is convenient, besides, to employ the term “being-modality” for 
the whole series of the being-characteristics, thus also for unmodified 
“ being” wherever this is to be considered as a member of this series — 
perhaps similar to the way in which the arithmetician also includes 
“ones” under the name number. In the same sense, we universalize 
the sense of the phrase, doxic modalities, under which we comprise,
16 
Addition in Copy A: the main lines and

often consciously with a double significancy, the noetic and noematic 
parallels.
Furthermore, in the designation of unmodalized being as “being 
certain,” one should heed the equivocation of the word “certain,” 
“certainty” [“gewi/3”]y and not only with respect to its signifying 
sometimes noetic, sometimes noematic “being certain.” It also serves 
(and here this is very misleading) to express, e.g., the correlate of 
affirmation: “yes” as the opposite of “no” and “not.” This must 
remain strictly excluded here. The significations of words continually 
shift within the bounds of immediate logical equivalence. But our 
task is to bring to light everywhere the equivalences, and to sharply 
seperate what lies behind them in essentially different phenomena.
Belief-certainty is belief simpliciter in the pregnant sense. It has, in 
fact, according to our analyses a highly remarkable special place in 
the multiplicity of acts all of which are comprehended under the title 
of belief— or “judgm ent” as is frequently but unsuitably said. A 
proper expression is needed which takes account of this special place 
and blots out every memory of the conventional placing of certainty 
and other belief-modes on a par. We introduce the term primal belief 
o rprotodoxa, by which the intentional retrorelatedness, elaborated by 
<217) us, of all “belief-modalities” is suitably expressed. We add further 
that we shall use this latter expression (or “doxic modality” ) for all 
intentional variants grounded in the essence of protodoxa, even for 
those new ones to be brought out in the following analyses.
We scarcely require a critique of the basically false theory accord­
ing to which a genus, “belief’ (or “judgm ent” ) is only differentiated 
into certainty, uncertain presumption, etc., as though it were a 
m atter there of a series of coordinate species (no m atter where the 
series is broken off) — just as color, sound, etc., are coordinate species 
in the genus, sensuous quality. In addition, we must refrain here, as 
elsewhere, from pursuing the consequences of what we have as­
certained phenomenologically.
§ 105. Belief-modality as Belief \ Being-modality as Being.
If, with respect to the highly remarkable situation described above, 
we speak of an intentionality whereby the secondary modes relate 
back to proto-doxa, the sense of this locution requires the possibility 
of multiple directions of regard of the kind which universally belong

to the essence of intentionality at a higher level. The possibility 
indeed exists. On the one hand, we can, e.g., while living in probability- 
consciousness (in the deeming likely) look at what is probable; on the 
other hand, we can, however, <look at> the probable itself as pro­
bable, that is, at the noematic Object as having the characteristic 
alloted to it by the deeming-likely noesis. The “Object,” however, 
with its sence-composition and with this probability-characteristic, is 
given as existing in the second focusing of regard: in relation to this, 
ac cordingly, consciousness is simple belief in the unmodified sense. 
Likewise we can live in possibility-consciousness fin the “deeming 
possible” ), or in questioning and doubting, our regard being directed 
to what we are conscious of there as possible, questionable, doubtful.
But we can also look at the possible, the questionable, doubtful as 
possible, questionable, doubtful and then, perhaps explicitly, seize 
upon the being possible, the being questionable, the being doubtful, 
predicating them of the sense-Object: the latter then is given as being 
in the unmodified sense.
Thus quite universally we can observe the highly remarkable 
eidetic peculiarity that, in relation to all the noetic moments the “intentional 
Object” as “ Object” is constituted as having by means of its noeses, every mental <218) 
process functions as belief-consciousness in the sense of protodoxa; or, as we 
can also say:
It is not the case that only new noematic characteristics are 
constituted by the new supervening noetic characteristics or by 
modifications of old ones; instead, new Objects posited as existent are 
therewith eo ipso constituted for consciousness; to the noematic 
characteristics correspond predicable characteristics in the sense- 
Object as actual and not merely noematically modified predicables.
These propositions will acquire further clarity when we have made 
ourselves familiar with new noematic spheres.
§106. Affirmation and Denial Along With Their Noematic Correlates.
Again a new retrorelated modification and, moreover, one which is 
possibly on a higher level by virtue ofits essential intentional relation 
back to belief-modalities of every sort, is rejection as well as its ana­
logue, assent. Expressed more specifically: denial and affirmation. Every 
denial is denial of something, and this something refers us back to 
some belief- modality or other. Noetically, therefore, negation is the

“ modification” of some “position” or other; that does not signify an 
affirmation but instead a “positing” in the extended sense of some 
belief-modality or other.
Its new noematic effect is the “cancellation” of the corresponding 
posited characteristic, its specific correlate is the cancellation-charac­
teristic, the characteristic of “not” The line of negation goes through 
something positional, more concretely stated, through a “positum” 
and, more particularly, by virtue of the cancellation of a specific 
positum-characteristic, i.e., of its being-modality. Precisely on this ac­
count this characteristic and the positum itself are present as “modifi­
cation” of something else. Differently stated: by transmutation of the 
simple being-consciousness into the corresponding negation- 
consciousness, the simple characteristic “existing” becomes, in the 
noema, “non-existing ”
Analogously, “possible,” “probable,” “questionable,” become 
“ impossible,” “improbable,” unquestionable.” And hence the 
whole noema, the whole “positum ” taken in its concrete noematic 
fullness, becomes modified.
Just as negation, metaphorically speaking, strikes out, so affirma* 
<219) tion “underscores ” it “confirms” a position by “assenting” instead of 
“annulling” it as in negation. This too yields a series of noematic 
modifications parallel to the cancellation-modifications. We cannot 
follow up on this here.
Up to now we have disregarded what is peculiar to the “position- 
taking” of the pure Ego which, in the rejection, specifically here in 
the negating <rejection>, is “directed” against what is rejected, against 
the being to be cancelled, just as in the affirmation <the Ego> is inclined 
toward what is affirmed, directed to it. This descriptive side of the 
situation should also not be overlooked and requires its own 
analysis.
Similarly, account is to be taken, again, of the circumstance that, 
with respect to the complexity of the intentionalities, different direc­
tions of the regard are always possible. We can live in the negating 
consciousness, in other words, “effect” the negation; the regard of the 
Ego is then directed to that which undergoes the cancellation. But we 
can also direct the regard as a seizing <regard> to the cancelled as 
cancelled, to that which bears the stamp of cancellation: <the cancelled) 
is then there as a new “Object” and, to be sure, it is there in the simple 
protodoxic mode as “existing ” The new focusing does not generate the 
new Object posited as existent; in the “effecting” of the rejection

what is rejected is also intended to as having the characteristic of 
cancelledness; but it is only in the new focusing that the characteristic 
becomes the predicable determination of the noematic sense-core. 
Likewise the same is also true, naturally, of affirmation.
The tasks of phenomenological eidetic analysis also lie, therefore, 
in this direction.18
§107. Reiterated Modifications.
W hat we have already appropriated by such analyses is sufficient 
to directly achieve the following advance of insight:
Since every negatum and affirmatum is itself an Object posited as 
existent, it can, like everything else intended to as having a mode of 
being, become affirmed or denied. In consequence of the constitution of 
something as existent effected anew at every step, an ideally infinite 
chain of reiterated modifications therefore results. Thus at the first level, <220) 
“not non-existent,” “not impossibly existent,” “not unquestionably 
existent,” “not improbably existent,” and so forth.
The same holds good, as is immediately seen, for all the modifica­
tions of being discussed earlier. That something is possible, probable, 
questionable, and so forth, can itself be intended to again in the mode 
of possibility, probability, questionability, the noematic being- 
formations corresponding to the noetic formations: it is possible that 
it is possible, that it is probable, that it is questionable; and thus in all 
complexities. Affirmata and negata correspond to the formation of 
higher levels, they being modifiable anew, and thus it continues, 
ideally stated, in infinitum. It is a m atter here of anything but mere 
verbal repetitions. We need only recall the theory of probability and 
its applications where possibilities and probabilities are continually 
weighed, denied, doubted, deemed likely, inquired into, ascertained, 
etc.
But it should aKvays be noted that the term modification refers, on 
the one hand, to a possible transmutation of the phenomena, thus to 
a possible actional operation; on the other hand, it refers to the much 
more interesting eidetic peculiarity of the noeses or to the noemas in
18 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : It would be instructive to think over the acute essay of Adolf Reinach,
“Zur Theorie des negativen Urteils” [“On the Theory of Negative Judgment”], Miinchntr 
Philos, Abhandlungen, 1911, on the basis of clarifications of the esscnce of doxic events which we 
have attempted in the present chapter, and to view its problems in our own light.

their pointing back to something other, something unmodified in 
their own essence, without any consideration of origin. But in both 
respects we stand on pure phenomenological grounds. For the terms 
transmutation and origin here refer to phenomenological eidetic 
occurences and in no way signify empirical mental processes as facts 
of Nature.
§108. Noematic 
Characteristics 
Not 
Determinations 
Produced 
by 
“Reflection
With each new group of noeses and noemas of which we have 
acquired clear consciousness, it is necessary that we also assure 
ourselves anew of the fundamental cognition so contrary to the habits 
of psychologistic thinking: that noesis and noema must be distin­
guished actually and correctly precisely to the extent demanded by 
faithful description. If one has already become accustomed to pure 
eidetic description of what is immanent (which so many have failed 
to do who otherwise prize description), and has brought himself in 
<221) that connection to grant to every consciousness an intentional Object 
as belonging to it and describable in its immanence, the temptation is 
still great to construe the noematic characteristics, and above all the 
ones last dealt with, as determinations merely produced by “reflection ” 
Recalling the usually narrow concept of reflection, we understand 
what that signifies: Determinations which accrue to the intentional 
Objects by virtue of being referred back to the modes of consciousness in 
which they are precisely Objects of consciousness.
Thus the negatum, the affirmatum, and the like, supposedly result 
because when relating reflection bears on the negating, on the 
affirming, likewise on the deeming likely, the “judgm ent-’’object is 
characterized as negated, as affirmed, as probable, and thus 
throughout. This is mere construction19already shown to be wrong 
by the fact that if these predicates were actually only predicates of 
relating reflection they could only be given just in actual reflection on 
the act-side and in relating to it. It is evident, however, that they are 
not given by such reflection. We seize upon what is properly a m atter 
of the correlate when we direct our regard directly and precisely to 
the correlate. We seize upon the negatum, the affirmatum, the
19 
a u t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : c f. Logische Untersuchungen, II1, 6. Unters., §44, pp. 61 Iff. <]second 
edition, Vol. II, 1, pp. 139ff.; English translation, pp. 782ff. )>

possible, the questionable, etc., the appearing object as appearing is 
constituted as having. Accordingly, in no way do we direct our 
regard back to the act. Conversely, the noetic predicates accruing by 
such reflection by no means have the same sense as the noematic 
predicates in question. Connected with this is the fact, therefore, that 
also from the standpoint of truth, non-being is obviously only equival­
ent to, and not identical with, “being validly negated;” being possible 
<is only equivalent to, and not identical with> “being accepted as 
possible in a valid way;” and the like.
Natural language, undistorted by any psychological prejudice, 
provides a witness for us should we need it. Looking into the stereo­
scope, we say: this appearing pyramid is “nothing,” is mere “semblan­
ce;” W hat is appearing as appearing is obviously the subject of 
predication and we ascribe to it (which is a physical thing-noema but 
not a physical thing) what we find present in it itself as a character­
istic — precisely nullity. Here, as throughout phenomenology, one 
must have the courage to accept what is really to be seen in the 
phenomenon precisely as it presents itself rather than interpreting it 
away, and to honestly describe it. All theories must be directed 
accordingly.
§ 109. The Neutrality Modification.
Among the modifications related to the sphere of belief we must still 
characterize a most important one which occupies a completely 
isolated place, therefore which need not be located in a series discus­
sed above. If we dedicate a detailed consideration of it at this place, 
this is justified by the peculiar manner in which it is related to doxic 
positing and by the circumstance that it can only be discovered in its 
peculiarity with a more profound investigation — as a highly signifi­
cant universal modification of consciousness rather than one specifi­
cally belonging just to the sphere of belief In this connection, we will 
also find the occasion to examine a kind of genuine belief- 
modification still lacking to us, easily confused with the new modifi­
cation in question: assumption.
It is a matter, now, of a modification which, in a certain way, 
completely annuls, completely renders powerless every doxic mod­
ality to which it is related — but it is a modification in a totally 
different sense than that of negation which, moreover, as we saw, has
<222)

its positive effect in the negatum: a non-being which is itself again a 
being. <The modification> does not cancel out, does not “effect” 
anything: it is the conscious counterpart of all producing: its neu­
tralization}20 It is included in every abstaining-from-producing 
something, putting-something-out-of-action, “parenthesizing-” it, 
“leaving-something-undecided” and then having-an-“undecided”- 
something, being-“immersed”-in-the-producing, or “merely con­
ceiving” the something produced without “doing anything with 
it.”21.
Since this modification has never been scientifically elaborated, 
and, therefore, also not fixed terminologically (where it had been 
touched upon it had been confused with other modifications), and 
since even a univocal name is lacking for it in ordinary language, we 
can only approach it circumscriptively and successively by a process 
of elimination. For all the expressions just collected together as a 
preliminary indication contain a surplus of sense. They all connote a 
voluntary doing, whereas that should not m atter at all. We therefore 
eliminate it. In any case, the result of this doing has a content 
peculiar to it which, by disregarding the fact that it “originates” in 
the doing (which too, naturally, would be a phenomenological 
Datum), can be considered in itself apart from such voluntary doing 
as it is possible and present in the concatenation of mental processes. 
If we thus exclude the letting-it-be-undecided pertaining to every­
thing voluntary, but also not understanding it in the sense of some- 
<223) thing dubitable or hypothetical, then there remains a certain having- 
an-“undecided” something or, better still, a certain having- 
something-“standing there” which is not “ actually” intended to as 
standing there. The posited characteristic has become powerless. 
Believing is now no longer serious believing, deeming likely is no 
longer serious deeming likely, negating is no longer serious negating, 
etc. It is a “neutralized.33 believing, deeming likely, negating, or the 
like, the correlates of which repeat those of the unmodified mental 
processes but in a radically modified way: the being simpliciter, the 
being possible, the being probable, likewise the non-being and each 
of the other negata and affirmata — all that is consciously there 
although not in the manner of something “actually” thought of but 
instead as something “merely thought of,” as “mere thought.” Every­
thing has the modifying “parentheses,” closely akin to22 to that of

which we have spoken so much before, and which is so important for 
preparing the way to phenomenology. Positings simpliciter, the non­
neutralized positings, have as resultant correlates “posita” which are 
characterized altogether as “what exists.” Possibility, probability, 
questionability, non-being and yes-being [Jasein] — all that is it­
self something “existing:” namely, characterized in the correlate 
as existing, as “intended to” in consciousness. Neutralized posit­
ings are essentially differentiated, however, by the fact that their 
correlates do not contain anything positable, anything actually predicable; in no 
respect does neutralized consciousness play the role of a “ believing” 
for what is intended to.
§110. Neutralized Consciousness and Legitimation of Reason. Assuming.
That an incomparable peculiarity of consciousness is really present 
here is shown by the fact that, in accordance with their essence, 
genuinely non-neutralized noeses are subject to the “ legitimation of 
reason ” whereas the question about reason and unreason makes no sensefor the 
neutralized noeses.
The situation is the same, correlatively, for the noemas. Everything 
characterized noematically as existing (certainly), as possible, 
deemed likely, questionable, null, etc., can thus be characterized in a 
“valid” or “invalid” way; it can be “in truth,” be possible, be null, 
etc. Whereas mere thinking-of “posits” nothingy it is not a positing conscious­
ness. The “mere thought o f’ actualities, possibilities, etc., “claims” 
nothing; it is neither to be admitted as correct nor rejected as 
incorrect.
Doubtless any merely thinking-of can be converted into an assum- <224) 
ing, a supposing, and this new modification (in the same way as that 
of merely thinking-of) is subject to unconditioned free will. In its 
turn, however, supposing is thus something like positing; the supposed, 
in its turn, is a kind of “positum” except that it is a modification of 
doxic positing entirely ofits own sort standing over against and apart 
from the principal series dealt with above. It can enter into the unity 
of posita to be judged about rationally as a member (the supposed as 
hypothetical “antecedent” or consequent) and hence itself be subject 
to rational valution. It is not of a mere undecided thought, but rather 
of what is hypothetically supposed that it can be said that it is correct 
or not. It is a fundamental error to confuse the one with the other and

to overlook the equivocations contained in the locutions: merely 
thinking-of or mere thought-of.
In addition there is, likewise, a deceptive equivocation contained 
in the word thinking in so far as it is at one time related to the 
distinctive sphere of explicating, conceiving and expressing thinking, 
to logical thinking in a specific sense; and, at another time, it is 
related to the positional as positional which, precisely as we have it in 
view here, does not ask about any explicating and conceiving 
predicating.
All of the occurrences considered here we find in the sphere of mere 
sensuous intuitions and their modifications into obscure objectivat­
ions, to which we have given preference in the first place.
§111. The Neutrality Modification and Phantasy.
But a still more dangerous equivocation of the expression, “merely 
thinking of,” comes into question; that is to say, a very likely confu­
sion must be guarded against, namely the confusion of the neutrality 
modification with phantasy. The deceptive and not really easily un­
tangled circumstance here consists of the facts that phantasy itself is 
in fact a neutrality modification, that it is of universal significance in 
spite of the peculiarity ofits type, applicable to all mental processes, 
that it also plays its role in most of the formations pertaining to 
thinking-of and must, nonetheless, be distinguished in that con­
nection from the universal neutrality modification with its manifold 
formations corresponding to all kinds of position.
More precisely stated: universally phantasying is the neutrality modifi­
cation of “positing” presentiation> therefore of memory in the widest 
conceivable sense.
<225) 
It must be noted here that in ordinary language presentiation 
(reproduction) and phantasy overlap. We use the expressions such 
that, taking account of our analyses, we leave the universal term 
presentiation without the indication of whether the relevant “posi­
tion” is properly so-called or neutralized. For universally presentat­
ions are divided into two groups: memories of every kind and their 
neutrality modifications. Nevertheless, it will be shown in what follows 
that this division cannot be accepted as a genuine classification.23

On the other hand, any mental process whatever (so to speak, any 
actually living <mental process>) is a mental process “presently exist­
in g ” Belonging to its essence is the possibility of reflection on the 
same <essence> in which it is necessarily characterized as certainly and 
presently existing. Accordingly, there corresponds to every mental 
process, as to every originarily individual being of which there is 
consciousness, a series of ideally possible memorial modifications. To 
mental living, as originary consciousness of the mental process, there corre­
spond, as possible parallels, the memories of it; in addition, therefore, 
as neutrality modifications <of memories> there correspond phantasies.
So it is for every mental process, no matter how it might be attended 
to in the pure Ego’s direction of regard. The following will serve by 
way of elucidation:
Whenever any objects whatever are presentiated — let us assume for 
the moment that it is a mere world of phantasy, and that we are 
attentively adverted to it — it then belongs to the essence of 
phantasying consciousness that not only this world, but also at the 
same time the perceiving “presentive o f’ it, is phantasied. We are 
adverted to it, to the “perceiving in phantasy” (i.e., the neutrality 
modification of memory), but only when, as we said before, we 
‘'reflect in phantasy.” It is, however, of fundamental significance not 
to confuse this modification, ideally possible at all times, which would 
convert any mental process, even the phantasying process itself, into 
the precisely corresponding mere phantasy, or, which is the same3 into 
neutralized memory, with that neutrality modification which we can set 
over against each “positing” mental process. In this respect memory is 
a wholly specific positing mental process. Another is normal per­
ception, yet another is the perceptive or reproductive consciousness <226) 
of possibility, probability, questionability, the consciousness of 
doubt, of negation, affirmation, supposition, etc.
We can persuade ourselves by an example that the neutrality 
modification of normal perception, positing in unmodified certainty, is the 
neutral picture-0 bject-consciousness which we find as component in 
normally considering the perceptually presentive depictured world.
Let us try to make that clear to ourselves: Let us suppose that we are 
considering Diirer’s engraving, “Knight, Death and the Devil.” In 
the first place, let us distinguish the normal perceiving, the correlate of 
which is the physical thing, “engraved print” this print in the portfolio.
In the second place, we distinguish the perceptive consciousness in 
which, within the black, colorless lines, there appear to us the figures

of the “knight on his horse,” “death,” and the “devil.” We do not 
advert to these in aesthetic contemplation as Objects; we rather 
advert to the realities presented “in the picture” — more precisely 
stated, to the “depictured” realities, to the flesh and blood knight, etc.
The consciousness of the “picture” (the small, grey figures in 
which, by virtue of founded noeses something else is “depictively 
presented” by similarity) which mediates and makes possible the 
depicturing, is now an example for the neutrality modification of 
perception. This depicturing picture-Object is present to us neither as 
existing nor as not existing> nor in any other positional modality; or, rather, 
there is consciousness of it as existing, but as quasi-existing in the 
neutrality modification of being.
Likewise the depictured too, when we comport ourselves purely 
aesthetically and take the same thing again as a “mere picture” 
without imparting to it the stamp of being or non-being, of being 
possible or being deemed likely, or the like. But this does not signify, 
as is apparent, any privation, but instead a modification — precisely 
that of neutralization. Except that we must not objectivate it as a 
transforming operation attached to a previous position. It can also be 
this on occasion. But it need not be.
§112. Reiterability of the Phantasy Modification. Non-reiterability of the 
Neutrality Modification.
The radical difference between phantasy in the sense of neutralizing 
<227) presentiation and neutralizing modification taken universally is shown
— to emphasize still more sharply this decisive point of difference — 
by the fact that, as presentiation, the phantasy modification is reiterable 
(there are phantasies at no matter what levels: phantasies “in” 
phantasies), while reiteration of the “operation” of neutralization is, by 
virtue of its essence, excluded.
O ur assertion of the possibility of reiterating reproductive (as well 
as depictive) modifications seems to meet with rather general oppo­
sition. This will only be changed when there will be more extensive 
practice in genuine phenomenological analysis than heretofore has 
been the case. As long as one deals with mental processes as “con­
tents” or as psychial “elements” which are still regarded as bits of 
things despite all the fashionable arguments against atomizing and 
physicalizing psychology, as long as one can believe that he has

found, accordingly, the distinction between “sensation-contents” 
and corresponding “phantasy-contents” only in the material traits of 
“intensity,” “fullness,” or the like, there can be no improvement.
One must first learn to see that at issue here is a difference 
pertaining to consciousness, that therefore the phantasma is not a mere, 
pale sensation-Datum but instead, in accord with its essence, 
phantasy of the corresponding sensation-Datum; furthermore, one 
must learn to see that this “o f’ cannot enter in by any rarefaction, no 
matter how refined, of intensity, of content-fullness, etc., pertaining 
to the sensation-Datum in question.
He who is practiced in consciousness-reflections (and has previ­
ously learned to see any data of intentionality of whatever sort) will 
see precisely without any further difficulty the levels of consciousness 
which present themselves with phantasies in phantasies or with 
memories in memories or in phantasies. One will then see too what is 
inherent in the essential sort of this hierarchical formation: namely 
that every phantasy of a higher level can be freely converted into a direct 
phantasy of what was indirectly phantasied in it, whereas this free 
possibility does not take place in going over from phantasy to the 
corresponding perception. For spontaneity there is an abyss here which the 
pure Ego can transcend only in the essentially new form of actualiz­
ing action and creation (where account must also be taken of 
hallucinating).24
554 a u t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : With respect to the points of the doctrine of neutrality modification 
dealt with up to now, the Logische Untersuchungen, in the main, had already arrived at the correct 
notion, especially with respect to what concerns the relation to phantasy. Cf. ibid., Fifth 
Investigation, especially §39, and the contrast of “qualitative” and “imaginative modificat­
ion” where the first has the sense of what is called here neutrality modification. — Since 
Meinong’s book, Uber Annahmen [On Assumptions] <Leipzig>, 1902) > has dealt in a detailed 
manner with questions closely akin lo those elaborated in the present chapter, I must explain 
hy 1 could relate the discussion only to my old writings and not to his book. In my opinion this 
book, which here as el.sewhere has such extensive coincidcnces with parallel parts of the Logische 
I ntetsuchungen 
with respect to content and theoretical thought — has not demonstrated any 
actual advance beyond my attempts, neither materially nor methodically. Many motivating 
thoughts, to which both before and afterwards 1 believe great weight should be attached, are 
not considered <by \leinong>, specifically not even with respect to the points dealt with above. 
T h e  confusions clarified in our last discussions make up exactly the principal c o re  of M e i n o n g ’.s 
conception of assumption.

<228) §113. Actual and Potential Positings,25
Our considerations of the neutrality modification and position neces­
sitate important supplementations. We have employed the term 
“positing” consciousness in a wide sense which necessarily requires a 
differentiation.
We distinguish26 actual and potential positing, and we employ “posit­
ion consciousness” as the universal heading which otherwise we cannot 
do without.
The difference between actuality and potentiality pertaining to 
positing is closely related to the previously discussed27 difference in 
actuality between attention and inattention. However, by no means 
do they coincide. By taking notice of the neutrality modification, a 
duality is introduced in the universal difference between the actu­
ality and non-actuality of the attentional turning of the Ego’s regard, 
or an ambiguity is introduced in the concept expressed by the term 
actuality, the essence of which we must clarify.
The neutrality modification appears to us in the contrast of actual2* 
believing, deeming likely, etc., with the peculiar modified conscious­
ness of “clearly phantasied possible” believing, deeming likely, etc.; 
stated correlatively, in the contrast between having what exists, what 
probably exists, etc., “ really” before one or “actually posited,” and 
having it in the manner of a “merely undecided something,” not 
actually posited. But at the outset we also indicated the essentially 
different proceeding of a non-neutral and a neutral consciousness 
with respect to the potentiality of positions. On the basis of any 
<229) “actual” consciousness various positings potentially included may be
25 
Note of translator: There is considerable ambiguity in Husserl’s use of the words aktuell and 
inaktuell. Earlier (§35) a mental process which is aktuell is one in which the ego “lives” in 
contrast to one in which the ego does not or is not now “living.” Here the same term, aktuell, is 
used for a different contrast: those mental processes which are “actual” or “potential” if not. 
This latter contrast cuts across the earlier one; thus a mental process in which the ego is not 
“living,” one which is inaktuell, can be aktuell in the sense of §113. Husserl’s apparent dissat­
isfaction with the terms can be seen in his frequent changes of aktuell to wirklich in his various 
copies of Ideen. (In later writings Husserl uses the terms aktiv and passiv for the earlier contrast, 
but also with significant conceptual differences.) To express Husserl’s distinction here in 
English, aktuell ( and inaktuell) in the earlier contrast is translated by actional (and non-actional)\ 
aktuell in the contrast of §113 is translated by actual.

derived, and these are then actual positings: in everything actually 
doxically intended to there are actual predicables. But in itself a 
neutral consciousness does not “contain” any sort of “ actual” predic­
ables. The explication by attentional actualities, by advertence to the 
different predicates of the objective something intended to, yields 
nothing but neutral acts or nothing but modified predicates. This 
disparate potentiality in neutral and non-neutral consciousness, this 
remarkable fact that the universal potentiality pertaining to at­
tentional advertences is thus bifurcated, now requires a profounder 
investigation.
The considerations of the last paragraph but one reveal that every 
actual mental process, as existing in the present — or, as we can also 
say, as the temporal unity constitued in phenomenological consci­
ousness of time — carries with itself, in a certain way, its own 
characteristic of being in a way similar to something perceived. To every 
present of the actual29 mental process there corresponds idealiter a 
neutrality modification, namely a possible present of the phantasy- 
process which precisely corresponds to it in content.30 Each such 
phantasy-process is not present as actually existing, but rather is 
characterized as “quasi” present. It is in fact quite similar to the 
comparison of noematic givennesses of any perception whatever with 
those of phantasying (contemplation in phantasy) precisely corre­
sponding to it idealiter: Everything perceived is characterized as 
“actually present being,” everything phantasied in parallel as the 
same in content but as “mere phantasy,” as “quasi” present being. 
Thus:
Consciousness of time originaliter itself functions as31 perceptual conscious­
ness and has its counterpart in a corresponding phantasy- 
consciousness.
However, this all-embracing consciousness of time is obviously not 
a continual perceiving of something immanent in the pregnant sense, i.e., in the 
sense of an actually positing perceiving which is, indeed, a mental 
process in our sense: a mental process inherent in immanental time, 
enduring in the present, constituted in the consciousness of time. In 
other words, it is without question not a continual inner reflection in 
which mental processes posited in the specific sense, seized upon as 
actually existing> would become objective.

Among the mental processes there are distinctive ones called 
reflections on something immanent, especially perceptions of some- 
<230) thing immanent which are directed to their objects in actually seizing 
upon and positing being. In addition, among the same mental 
processes there are also those perceptions, positing being in the same 
sense, which are directed to something transcendent, the so-called 
perceptions of something external. In the normal sense of the word, 
“perception” not only signifies universally that some physical thing or 
other appears “personally”present to the Ego, but that the Ego attentively 
perceives the appearing physical thing, seizing upon, positing it as 
actually existing. The actuality of positing factual existence is, ac­
cording to what was elaborated before, neutralized in perceptual 
picture-consciousness.32 Adverted to the “picture” (not to the de­
pictured), we do not seize upon anything actual as object, but instead 
precisely a picture, a fictum. “Seizing-upon” has the actuality per­
taining to advertence, but it is not “actual” seizing-upon; it is rather 
mere seizing-upon in the modification of “quasi” the positing is not 
actual33 positing but instead modified into “quasi-<positing>.”
By turning the mental regard away from the fictum, the at­
tentional actuality pertaining to the neutralized position passes over 
into potentiality: the picture still appears but is not “heeded,” it is 
not — in the mode of “quasi” — seized upon. Included in the essence 
of this situation and its potentiality are possibilities for actual adver­
tences which here, however, never allow actualities of position to 
emerge.
Something similar occurs when we compare “actional” (not neu­
tral, actually positing34) rememberings with those in which the remem­
bered still appears, to be sure, but is no longer actually posited by 
turning away the regard. The potentiality of the position of what

there emerge not just any seizing-upon cogitationes whatever, but 
precisely those which “ actually” seize upon, which actually posit. In 
the neutrality modifications of rememberings, i.e., mere phantasies, 
we have attentional potentialities the transmutation of which into 
actualities yield, to be sure, “acts” (cogitationes), but entirely neu-

rather it only “hovers” before us as what is without actuality of 
position.36 Mere advertence of the regard cannot set aside this neu­
trality, no more than it can generate posited actuality37 in other 
cases.
Every perception has — and this can still serve us by way of further 
illustration — its background of perception. The specific physical 
thing seized upon has its perceptively co-appearing physical sur­
roundings, lacking particular positing of factual existence. It is also an <231) 
“actually existing” surroundings, intended to in such a manner that
— in the sense of an eidetic possibility — an actual, existence-positing 
regard can be directed to it. It is, to a certain extent, a unity of potential 
positions. The situation is similar in the case of memory and its 
memorial background; or also in the case of perception or of memory 
with respect to their halo ofretentions and protentions, retrospective 
memory and anticipations which press forward in greater or lesser 
fullness and change in their degrees of clarity, but are not effected in 
the form of actual positings. In all these cases the actualization of 
“potential positions” necessarily leads, by corresponding adver­
tences of regard (attentional actuality), to always new actual posit­
ions, and this belongs to the essence of this situation. But if we pass 
over to the parallel neutrality modifications, then everything is 
translated into the modification of the quasi, even the “potentiality” 
itself. The picture-Object and the phantasy-Object also (and neces­
sarily) have attentional backgrounds. “Background” is, again, the 
name for potential advertences and “seizings-upon.” However, the 
effecting of actual advertence does not, of essential necessity, lead 
here to actual positions but always only to modified ones.
O f particular interest to us here is the fact that the same thing 
happens with the modal variations of the specific doxic positing 
(doxic primal positing), with deeming likely, deeming possible, 
questioning, etc., as well as with denying and affirming. The corre­
lates intended to in them, possibility, probability, non-being, and the 
like, can undergo doxic positing and therefore at the same time 
specific “objectivation.” But while we “live in” the deeming likely,

questioning, rejecting, affirming, or the like, we do not effect any 
doxic primal positing — although other “positings ” in the sense of a 
necessary universalization of the concept, <are effected) — that is to 
say: positings pertaining to deeming likely, to questionability, to denying, etc. 
But we can at any time effect the corresponding doxic primal posit­
ings; grounded in the essence of the phenomenological situations is the 
ideal possibility of actualizing the potential positings included in them.38 
This actualization leads now, if actual positings were involved at the 
outset, always again to actual positings as potentially included in the 
<232) positings which are the starting point. If we translate the positings 
which are the starting point into the language of neutrality, the 
potentiality is also translated into <the language of neutrality.) If we 
effect deemings likely, questionings, or the like, in mere phantasy, 
then everything developed before indeed subsists, but now with 
changed signs. All of the doxic positings and modalities of being, 
derived from the original acts or act-noemas by possible attentional 
turning of the regard, are now neutralized.
§114. Further Concerning the Potentiality of Positing and the Neutrality 
Modification.
The difference between non-neutral and neutral consciousness con­
cerns, according to the analyses carried out, not only processes of 
consciousness in the attentional mode of the cogito, but also in the 
mode of attentional non-actuality. <The distinction) is manifested in 
the double comportment of the “backgrounds” of consciousness in 
their attentional transmutation into “foregrounds;” more precisely 
stated, in their transmutation into attentional actualities with which 
the original mental process is converted into a doxic cogito, indeed, 
into protodoxa. This39 is without question possible under all circum­
stances; for belonging to the essence of every intentive mental process 
is the possibility of “looking at” its noeses as well as its noemas, at the 
noematically constituted objectivities and their predicates — of 
seizing upon and positing them in the mode of protodoxa.

39 In Copy A This is ... circumstances changed to read: Now, what we have ascertained in the case 
of doxic mental processes and also especially in the case ot doxic modalities, is transferred to all 
intentive mental processes universally; fpublished by Schuhmann as Appendix 57, ca. 1914\.

As we can also say, the situation is that the neutrality modification is 
not a specific modification attached to actional positings, which are the 
only ones which are actual; it is, instead, an eidetically fundamental 
peculiarity concerning any consciousness whatever, expressed in the attitude 
toward actual protodoxic positableness or non-positableness. Whence 
the necessity to exhibit them just in the actual primal positings or in 
the modification which they undergo.
Determined in greater detail, it is a question of the following: O f 
whatever kind and form it may be, taken universally, consciousness is 
traversed by a radical separation: in the first place, as we know, there 
belongs to every consciousness in which the pure Ego does not live 
from the outset as an “effecting” Ego, which therefore does not have 
the form “cogito” from the outset, the essentially possible modifica­
tion of being converted into this form. There now exist two funda­
mental possibilities for the mode of the effecting of consciousness 
within the mode of cogito;40 or expressed in another way:
To every cogito there belongs a counterpart which precisely corresponds to it <233) 
such that its noema has its precisely corresponding counter-noema in the 
parallel cogito.
The relationship of the parallel “ acts” consists of the fact that one 
of the two is an “actual act,” the cogito an “actual” <cogito,> an 
“actually positing” cogito, while the other is a “shadowing” of an act, 
an improper, not “ actually positing” cogito. The one act actually 
produces, the other is a mere reflection of a production.41
To this there corresponds the radical difference of correlates: on the 
one side, there is the constituted noematic production which has the 
characteristic of the unmodified, actual production; on the other 
side, there is the “mere thought of ’ the precisely corresponding pro­
duction. The actual and modified <productions> correspond to each 
other idealiter with absolute precision and yet they are not of the same 
essence. For the modification is carried over to the essence: to the originary

41 In Copy A marginal note to this paragraph: Does not agree with p. 236; substitute appendix.
Published as Appendix 58, ca. 1914, by Schuhmann, this paragraph is altered to read: The relationship of 
the parallel “acts” consists of the fact that one of the two is an actually positing act (an actual 
believing, doubting, valuing, wishing, etc.), the other, in contrast, is only a quasi positing act 
of the sort whose positing is improper, namely neutrally modified, and that quite apart from the 
attrntional form of the cogito. (We thus broaden, at the same time, the concept of position to 
cover all the “act-characteristics” parallel to the doxic “act-characteristic, 
as wi 
explained still more precisely.)

essence there corresponds its counter-essence as a “shadow” of the same 
essence.
O f course, in the metaphorical language of shadows, reflection, 
picture, one should not insinuate anything of mere illusion, of de­
ceptive opinion, or the like, by which indeed actual acts or positional 
correlates would be given. It is not necessary to warn anew against 
the so obvious confusion of the modification at issue here with the 
phantasy modification which likewise creates a counterpart, its 
phantasy image, for every mental process — as the present of the 
mental process in the consciousness of internal time.
The radical separation of intentional mental processes into two 
classes which stand to each other as actuality and powerless reflection 
of noematic producing, is made manifest to us here (when we start 
out from the doxic domain) by the foWoWmgfundamental propositions:
Every cogito is42 in itself either a doxic primal positing or it is not. 
But by virtue of a lawfulness once more belonging to the generically 
fundamental essence of any consciousness whatever, any cogito can 
become converted into a doxic primal positing. <That occurs,> how­
ever, in many different ways, and especially in such a way that every 
“posited characteristic” in the widest sense, constituted in the noema of 
this cogito as correlate of noetic “positing” (in a correspondingly 
widest sense) belonging to the cogito, undergoes transmutation into a 
being-characteristic and accordingly takes on the form of a modality of 
being in the widest of all senses. In this way the characteristic of “pro­
bable,” which is the noematic correlate of deeming likely and, to be 
<234) sure, specifically of the “act-characteristic” of the “postiting” of 
deeming likely as deeming likely, is converted into being probable; 
similarly, the noematic characteristic of “questionable,” this specific 
correlate of positing of questionability, is converted into the form of 
being questionable; the negation-correlate is converted into the form 
of non-being: pure forms which, so to speak, have taken on the stamp of 
the actual doxic primal positing. But this extends still further. We 
will find grounds for extending the concept of positing to all act- 
spheres and thus speak of, e.g., liking—positing, wishing-positing, 
willing-positing, with their noematic correlates “likes,” “wished 
for,” “ought to be in the practical realm,” and the like. These 
correlates also take on the form of being-modalities in an extremely 
extended sense by the a priori possible conversion of the acts in

question into a doxically primal positing: Thus the “liked,” the 
“wished for,” the “ought,” etc., become predicable; for in the actual, 
primal belief-positing it is intended to as being pleasant, as being 
wished for, etc.43 But the conversion — in these examples — is to be 
understood in such a way that it preserves the noema of the original 
mental process with regard to its whole essence except for the mode of 
givenness which changes with the conversion in conformity to laws. 
Nevertheless, this point still requires supplementation.44
The cases are now radically separated by the fact that the proto­
doxa in question is either an actual protodoxa, so to speak, an 
actually believed belief or, however, its powerless counterpart, the 
mere “thinking of” (being simpliciter, being possible, etc.). W hat 
results from that doxic transmutation of the particular mental pro­
cess, be it the unfolding of its noematic components into actual 
doxically primal positions, or be it exclusively into protodoxic neu­
tralities, is predetermined with absolute firmness by the essence of the 
intentive mental process in question. From the outset, therefore a 
firm set of potential being-positions is predesignated in the essence of 
every mental process of consciousness and, more particularly, de­
pending on how the respective consciousness is characterized from 
the beginning, a field of possible actual positions or possible neutral 
“shadow positions” <is predesignated>.
And, again: universally consciousness is of such a character that it is of 
a double type: prototype and shadow, positional and neutral conscious­
ness. The one is characterized by the fact of its doxic potentiality 
leading to actual positing doxic acts; the other by being only a <235) 
shadow-image of such acts, by only allowing a neutrality modifica­
tion to emerge from them; in other words, <it is characterized by the 
fact> that nothing doxically graspable is contained in its noematic 
composition or, which again is equivalent, that it does not contain an 
“actual” noema but instead only a counter-image of an <“actual” 
noema>.45Merely one doxic positedness only remains to the neutral

45 In Copy A the following text substituted for And, again ... counter-image, and published by 
Schuhmann as Appendix 59, ca. 1914: More precisely in this regard, the following law holds:
Universally, any process of consciousness has a double value in accordance with its double type 
as “prototype” and “shadow.” as positional or neutral consciousness, as well as with respect to its 
doxic potentiality: if it is of the positional type, then the unfolding ofits doxic potentiality leads to
purely actual, to positional doxic acts; if it is of the neutral type, to purely neutral acts. In the 
latter cases it contains, in other words, in its noematic composition nothing at all which is 
doxically seizable or, equivalently stated, it contains nothing “actually” noematic of any kind 
but only “counter-images” of noemas.

mental processes: that belonging to them as consciousness of Data in 
immanental time, determining them precisely as modified conscious­
ness of a modified noema.46
From now on the expressions “positional” and “neutral” should 
serve us terminologically. Every mental process, whether it has the 
form of cogito or whether it is or is not an act in some other particular 
sense, falls under this opposition. Positionality therefore does not 
signify the presence or the effecting of an actual position; it only 
expresses a certain potentiality for the effecting of actional positing 
doxic acts. Let us nevertheless include in the concept of positing 
mental processes the case where a mental process is from the outset a 
position which has been effected — an inclusion which is less ob­
jectionable because, according to eidetic law, to every position effec­
ted there belongs a plurality of potential positions.
The distinction between positionality and neutrality does not express, 
as has been confirmed, any mere, peculiar ownness related to belief- 
positings, any mere sort ofbelief-modification such as deeming likely, 
questioning, or the like, or, in another direction, assumings, negat- 
ings, affirmings — therefore not variations of a primal mode, of 
believing in the pregnant sense. As we had foretold, it is in fact a 
universal difference pertaining to consciousness but which, for good reasons, 
in the course of our analysis appears connected with the distinction 
specifically demonstrated in the narrow sphere of the doxic cogito 
between position (i.e., actual) believing and its neutral counterpart 
(the merely “thinking-off”). There emerge really remarkable and 
profound eidetic combinations among act-characteristics of believ­
ing and all other kinds of act-characteristics, and thus all kinds of 
consciousness.

oppostition of potentiality and actuality and, more particularly, in 
the universal signification of these terms in so far as we now, in the 
transition to the explicit49 cogito and in the reflection on the mental 
process not made explicit50 along with its noetic-noematic compo­
nents, are able to recognize that it includes in itself intentionalities or 
noemas which are peculiar to it. Thus, e.g., with regard to conscious­
ness of the unobserved, but subsequently observed, background in 
the case of perception, memory, etc. The explicit51 intentive mental 
process is an “ I think” which is “ effected.” But the same “ I think” 
can be converted into a “non-effected” one by way of intentional 
changes. The mental process pertaining to an effected perceiving, to 
an effected judging, feeling, willing, does not disappear when at­
tention adverts “exclusively” to something new; this implies that the 
Ego “lives” exclusively in a new cogito. The earlier cogito “fades 
away,” sinks into “darkness” , but nonetheless always has an 
existence pertaining to the mental process, even if modified. Similar­
ly, cogitationes break forth into the background of the mental pro­
cess, sometimes modified memorially, sometimes neutrally, even 
sometimes unmodified. E.g., a belief, an actual belief, is “aroused;” 
we already believe “before we know it.” Similarly, under circum­
stances positing of likings or dislikings, desirings, even resolves, are 
already alive before we “live” in them, before we effect the cogito 
proper, before the Ego is “activated” judgingly, likingly, desiringly, 
willingly.
Thus the cogito designates in fact (and so we had introduced the 
concept previously) the act proper of perceiving, of judging, of 
liking,52 etc. On the other hand, however, the whole structure of the 
mental process in the cases described, with all its positings and 
noematic characteristics, is the same even when this actionality of the 
cogito is lacking to it. It is to that extent that we separate more 
dictinctly effected acts and non-effected acts;bZ the latter are either acts 
which “have fallen out of effectuation,” or they are act-arousals. The 
latter term can just as well be employed universally for any non-

by Schuhmann]

effected acts whatever. Such act-arousals are lived with all their 
intentionalities, but the Ego does not live in them as an “effecting 
subject.” With that the concept of act is extended in a determined and 
quite indispensable sense. The effected acts, or as stated better in a 
certain respect (namely, with respect to the fact that it concerns 
processes), the act-effectings make up the “position-takings” in the widest 
<237) sense, whereas the use of the term “position-taking” in the pregnant 
sense54 refers back to founded acts of the sort which we shall examine 
in more precise detail: E.g., to position-takings of hatred, or of the 
one who hates toward what is hated which, on its side, is already 
constituted for consciousness in noeses at a lower level as the existing 
person or affair; likewise, position-takings of negation or affirmation 
with respect to existential claims or the like would belong here.55
It is now clear that acts in the widest sense,56 precisely as in the case 
of specific cogitationes, bear within themselves the distinction be­
tween positionality and neutrality, that they are productive noemat­
ically and positionally prior to the transmutation into cogitationes, 
except that we only first catch sight of these productions by acts in the 
narrower sense, by cogitationes. The positings, or the positings in the 
mode of “quasi,” are already actually present in them with the whole 
noeses to which these positings belong: the ideal case being presup­
posed that they are not also intentively enriched and otherwise 
altered at the same time <that the noeses are> transmuted. In any case, 
we can exclude these alterations (and, in particular, also the in­
tentive enrichments and new formations which enter into the flow of 
mental processes immediately after the transmutations).
In our whole examination under the title “neutrality”57 doxic 
positings were given preference. Neutrality has its index in potent­
iality.58 Everything rests upon the fact that any positing act-characteristic
54 In Copy A this sentence changed to read (published by Schuhmann as Appendix 60, ca. *1914): Pre­
eminently the use of the term “to effect” is applicable to the moment of positing (position) 
pertaining to the essence of the act, of else to the variation shared by precisely this moment in 
the conversion into the form cogito. The effected positing (according to the earlier mode of 
expression, the actual or actualized positing) determines 
restricting ourselves to the case of 
positionality — a widest sense of the use of the term “position-taking” or position-taking acts. 
There is, accordingly, a position-taking act for every perceiving, judging, valuing, etc., for every 
effected and non-ncutralized <at t>. On the other hand, while the use of the term “position- 
taking” [the original text continuesJ

whatever (any act-“intention,” e.g., the liking-intention, the valuing, 
willing-intention, the specific characteristic of liking-positing, 
willing-positing) includes in its essence a characteristic of the genus, doxic 
positing, “coinciding” with it in a certain manner. According as the act- 
intention in question is non-neutralized or neutralized,59 so is the 
doxic positing included in it — thought of here as primal positing.
In the further analyses this preference for doxic primal positing 
will undergo a limitation. It will be seen that the eidetic lawfulness we 
have developed requires a more precise determination in so far as, 
first of all and universally, the doxic modalities (in the specific sense 
which also embraces assumings) obtain in place of, or replace, the 
doxic primal positings as the “doxic positings” included in all 
positings. Within this universal primacy of any doxic modalities 
whatever, the doxic primal positing, the doxic certainty, then has, 
however, the quite particular primacy of these modalities themselves <238) 
being transmuted into aoxic positings so that now, again, all neu­
trality has its index in the doxic potentiality in the distinctive sense of 
being related back to the primal positing. In this connection, the kind 
of “coincidence” of anything doxic whatever with positing of any 
sort receives its more precise determination.60
Now, the propositions stated in the widest universality (although 
with some omissions), but which can only be made with insight into 
specific act-spheres, immediately require a broader basis of ground­
ing. We have not yet thoroughly examined the parallelism of noesis 
and noema in all realms of intentionality. O f itself this principal 
theme of this Part also demands the extension of analysis. However, 
in carrying out this extension our universal assertions about the 
neutrality modification will at the same time be confirmed and 
supplemented.
§116 Transition to New Analyses. The Founded Noeses and Their Noema­
tic Correlates.
We studied before a series of universal events in the structure of 
noeses and noemas within a large and yet very restricted framework
— studied them, to be sure, on a very modest scale only to the extent

required to make them stand out and to achieve our guiding purpose 
of acquiring for ourselves a universal idea, rich in content, of the 
groups of problems which the universal dual theme of noesis and 
noema carries with it. No m atter how many different complications 
they have attracted, our studies are related to a mere lower stratum 
of the stream of mental processes to which intentionalities of an even 
relatively simpler structure always belong. We have shown a pre­
ference (aside from the last anticipatory observations) for sensuous 
intuitions, in particular those of appearing realities, as well as for 
the61 sensuous objectivations which emerge from them by being ob­
scured and yet which, without question, are united with them by a 
community of essence. At the same time, <sensuous objectivation> 
designates the genus. As a result, we also draw into consideration, 
more particularly, all phenomena essentially belonging to it, thus 
reflective intuitions and objectivations taken universally, the objects 
<239) of which are no longer things pertaining to the senses.62 The universal 
acceptance of our results, given the way in which we have conducted 
the investigation, and suggesting the feeling that whatever is attached 
to the lower domain is incidental, is forced upon us as soon as we 
extend the framework of our research. We then see that all the 
differences between the central core of sense (which certainly needs 
further analysis), and the posited characteristics grouped about it, 
return and likewise all the modifications which — like those of 
presentiation, attention, neutralization — affect the core of sense in 
its own peculiar ways, nonetheless leaving its “something identical.” 
We can now follow two different directions, both of which lead to 
intentionalities founded on objectivations: we can either go in the 
direction toward noetic syntheses, or in that which leads up to new 
sorts of,63 but founded, species of “positing”
If we take the latter direction, then we encounter the noeses of 
feeling, of desiring, of willing (first of all, the simplest ones possible, i.e., 
free of syntheses at lower or higher levels), which are founded on 
“objectivations,” 
on 
perceptions, 
on 
memories, 
on 
sign- 
objectivations etc., and which, in their structure, show obvious

82 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  The firm and essential delimitation of the broadest concept of 
objectivation which arises from the spheres designated is, naturally, an important task for 
systematic phenomenological research. For all such questions we refer to prospective publica­
tions. The present investigation briefly indicates the findings derived from the theoretical 
content of those future publications.
63 In Copy A new sorts of changed to new

differences in level-by-level founding. We now give preference 
everywhere, as concerns the total acts, to the positional forms (which 
ought not, however, exclude neutral lower levels) because what is to 
be said of them carries over, appropriately modified, to the corre­
sponding neutralizations. For example, an aesthetic liking may be 
founded on a neutrality-consciousness with a perceptual or repro­
ductive content; a gladness or a sorrow on a (non-neutralized) belief 
or belief-modality; a striving for or against on the same, but related to 
something valued as agreeable, or beautiful, etc.64
Before going into the species of this structure, what interests us here 
is that with the new noetic moments new noematic moments also make 
their appearance in the correlates. On the one hand, there are new 
characteristics which are analogous to the modes of belief but possess, at 
the same time, themselves doxo-logical65 positiableness in their new 
content; on the other hand, connected with the novel moments there 
are also novel “apprehensions ” and a new sense becomes constituted 
which is founded on, while at the same time embracing, the noesis 
underlying it. The new sense brings in a totally new dimension of sense; 
with it no new determining parts of mere “ things” are constituted, 
but instead values of things, value-qualities, or concrete Objects with <240) 
values: beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness; the use-Object, 
the art work, the machine, the book, the action, the deed, and so 
forth.
Moreover, any full mental process of the higher level also shows in 
its full correlate a structure similar to the one we have seen at a lower 
level. In the noema belonging to the higher level the valued as valued is possibly a 
core of sense surrounded by new posited characteristics. The “valued,” the 
“likeable,” “happy,” etc., function in a way similar to the “possi­
ble,” “presumable,” or, again, like “ null,” or “indeed” — although 
it would be absurd to put them in this series of characteristics.
With respect to these new characteristics consciousness is again, in 
this connection, a positing consciousness: the “valued” can be doxi­
cally posited as being valuable. Furthermore, “being,” which be­
longs to “value” as its characterization, can also be meant as modal- 
ized like any “existing” or “certain:” if so, consciousness is then 
consciousness of possible values; the “ thing” only suggests itself as

<possibly> valuable; or else it is intended to as presumably valuable, as 
non-valuable (which, however, is not equivalent to saying “worthless”
— bad, ugly or the like; cancelling out “value” is expressed simply by 
“non-valuable” ). All such modifications affect value-consciousness, 
the valuing noeses, not just externally but also internally, as well as 
the corresponding noemas (cf. p. 243).
A multiplicity of profound alterations result again in the form of 
attentional modifications according as, in conformity with the mani­
fold eidetic possiblities, the attentive regard passes through the various 
intentive strata to the “materially determinate affair” and the 
material moments — resulting in an interrelated system of modificat­
ions which we already know as a lower level; but the regard then is 
also directed to the values, to the constituted determinations belong­
ing to a higher level, by passing through the apprehensions constitut­
ing them; then <the attentive regards is directed> to the noemas as 
noemas, again, to their characteristics or, in the other reflection, to 
the noeses — and all of this in the specific modes of attending to, 
marginal observing, non-observing or the like.
Extremely difficult investigations are to be carried out in order to 
explicate purely and make clear these complicated structures, how, 
eg., the “value-apprehensions” are related to the apprehensions of 
materially determinate affairs, how the new noematic character- 
<241) izations (good, beautiful, and so forth) are related to modalities of 
belief, how they systematically fit into series and species, and the 
same for similar questions.
§117. The Founded Positings and the Conclusion of the Doctrine of Neutrality 
Modifications. The Universal Concept of Positing.
We shall now examine the relationship of new noetic and noematic 
strata of consciousness to neutralization. We relate this modification 
to doxic positionality. As we can easily persuade ourselves, in the 
strata now being made prominent, this <positionality> plays the role 
in fact which we attributed to it in advance in the widest act-spheres 
and which we specifically considered in the <act-sphere> of modalities 
of judgment. In the consciousness which deems likely, the “likely,” 
the “probable,” are positionally “inherent;” likewise, however, in 
the consciousness which likes, the “pleasing” is also “inherent;” in 
the consciousness which is glad, the “gladsome” is inherent; and so

forth. It is inherent in it, i.e., it is accessible to doxic positing, and on 
that account it is predicable. Accordingly, every emotional consci­
ousness, along with its novel founded emotional noeses, comes under 
the concept of positing consciousness as we have elaborated this 
concept for ourselves — with reference to doxic positionalities and 
ultimately to positional certainties.
Seen more precisely, however, we must still say that the relating of 
the neutrality modification to doxic positionality, important as the 
insights are which it grounds, still has been taken in a certain sense in 
a roundabout way.
Let us make it clear, first of all, that acts of liking (“effected” or 
not), likewise emotional or volitional acts, of every kind are precisely 
“acts,” “intentive mental processes,” and that belonging to them, in 
every case, is the “intentio,” the “position-taking;” or, expressed in 
another way, they are “positings” in a widest but essentially unified 
sense, although not doxic positings. We said above in passing, quite 
correctly, that, taken universally, act-characteristics are “positings”**
— positings in the extended sense and only in the particular belief- 
positings or their modalities. The essential analogy of specific liking- 
noeses with the belief-positings is obvious, as is the case with wishing- 
noeses, willing-noeses, etc. Even in valuing, wishing, willing, some­
thing is “posited,” apart from the doxic positionality “inherent” in 
them.67 That is indeed also the source of all parallelizations between 
the various species o f’consciousness and the classification of those 
species: one properly classifies the species of positing.
To the essence of every intentive mental process, whatever may <242) 
otherwise be found in its concrete composition, there belongs the 
having of at least one, but as a rule many, “positing-characteristics,” 
“positings,” interconnected by way of the relationship of founding; 
there is, in this plurality, then, necessarily a positing which is archon- 
tic, so to speak, which unifies and governs all the others.
The highest generic unity connecting all these specific “act- 
characteristics,” the characteristic of “positing,” does not exclude 
essential and generic differences.68 Thus the emotional positings are

akin to the doxic positings as positings, but they by no means belong 
together as do all modalities of believing.
Given eo ipso along with the generic community of essence belong­
ing to all positing-characteristics is the community of essence belong­
ing to their noematic correlates of positing (the “positing character­
istics in the noematic sense” ); and if we take the latter with their 
further noematic foundations, then the community of essence be­
longing to all “posita” is eo ipso given. Ultimately grounded in this, 
however, are the analogies, always felt, between universal logic, 
universal theory of values, and ethics which, if followed to their 
ultimate depths, lead to the constitution of the universal formal 
parallel disciplines of formal logic, formal axiology, and theory of 
practice.69
We are thus led back to the universalized heading of “positing,” to 
which we now relate the following proposition:
Every consciousness is either an actual or potential “positing” consciousness. 
The earlier concept of “actual positing ” and along with it that of 
positionality, undergo therefore a corresponding extension. As a con­
sequence, our doctrine of neutralization and its relationship to posit­
ionality is carried over to the extended concept of positing. There 
thus pertains to any positing consciousness whatever, whether or not 
it is effected, the universal modification which we called the neu­
tralizing modification and, more particularly,70directly in the follow­
ing way. On the one hand, we have characterized positing of posi­
tions [positionalen Thesen] by the fact that they are actual positings or 
are converted into actual ones; that, as a consequence, they have 
“actual” positable noemata — actually positable in the extended 
sense. In contrast to these, there are the improper, the “quasi”- 
positings, the ineffectual mirrorings, incapable of taking up into 
themselves any actual position-effectuations with respect to their 
<243) noemata, not even neutralized ones. The distinction between neu­
trality and positionality has its noetic and noematic parallel; it 
directly concerns, as conceived here, all sorts of positional character­
istics without taking the way around positions in the narrow and only 
ordinary sense of the word doxic primal positing — in which it alone 
can demonstrate itself.
But that signifies that the pre-eminence of this specifically doxic 
positing has its deepest foundation in the things themselves. Accord-

ing to our analyses precisely the doxic modalities, and among them in 
a particular way, the doxic primal positing, that of belief-certainty, 
have the unique primacy that their positional potentiality embraces 
the entire sphere of consciousness. According to an eidetic law, any 
positing, of no m atter what genus, can be transmuted into an actual 
doxic positing by virtue of the doxic characterizations inseparably 
belonging to its essence. A positional act posits, but in no matter 
which “quality” it posits, it also posits doxically; whatever is posited 
by it in another mode is also posited as existing: except that <it is not 
posited> actually. But actuality can be generated in conformity with 
its essence in the manner of an essentially possible “Operation.” Any 
“positum,” e.g., a wish-positum, can thereby be transmuted into a 
doxic positum, and it is then in a certain manner still both in one: at 
the same time, doxic positum and wish-positum.
In this connection, it is conformable to the eidetic laws that the 
primacy of the doxic properly concerns the doxic modalities in a universal way.
For every emotional mental process, every valuing, every wishing, 
willing, is in itself either characterized as being certain or as being 
deemed possible or else as a valuing, wishing, being willed, deemed 
likely, doubtful.71 Thus, for example, when we are not focused on the 
doxic modalities value is precisely not actually posited in its doxic 
characteristics. Value is intended to in valuing, the pleasing in liking, 
the gladsome in being glad, but sometimes in such a way that we are 
not entirely “certain” in valuing; or, such that the thing is only 
deemed possible as valuable, as perhaps valuable, while we still do 
not take sides in the valuing. Living in such modifications of valuing 
consciousness, we need not be focused on the doxic. But we can 
become so focused when, perchance, we are living in the positing of 
deeming possible and then pass over into the corresponding belief- 
positing which, conceived predicatively, now receives the form: “ the <244) 
thing should be valuable;” or, turning to the noetic side and to the 
valuing Ego: “it suggests itself to me as valuable (or perhaps valu­
able).” The same holds for other modalities.
Doxic modalities, in this form, are inserted into all posited characteristics 
and, if the mode is that of certainty, doxic primal positings coincide 
with the posited characteristics according to the noematic sense. But 
because this also holds for the doxic variations, doxic primal positings

thus also inhere (now no longer in noematic coincidence) in every 
act.
We can, accordingly, also say: Every act, or every act-correlate, includes 
in itself, implicitly or explicitly, something “logical ” It is always to be 
explicated logically, namely by virtue of the essential universality 
with which the noetic stratum of “expressing” allows of being at­
tached to everything noetic (or that of expression to everything 
noematic). 11 is thereby evidential that with the passing over into the 
neutrality modification the expressing itself and its expressed as 
expressed are neutralized.
Resulting from all that is the fact that any acts whatever — even 
emotional and volitional acts — are “objectivating,” “constituting” objects 
originaliter <and therefore necessary sources of different regions of 
being and their respective ontologies. For example: valuing consci­
ousness constitutes the unique “axiological” objectivity in contrast to 
the mere world of things, a “being” of a new region in so far as 
precisely by virtue of the essence belonging to any valuing conscious­
ness whatever actual doxic positings are predelineated as ideal possi­
bilities which single out objectivities of a unique content — values — 
as “intended to” in valuing consciousness. In emotional acts they are 
intended to as emotional; by actualization of the doxic content 
belonging to these acts they come into doxic and, furthermore, into 
logical-expressive, meantness.
Every non-doxically effected act of consciousness is in this fashion 
potentially objectivating; the doxic cogito alone effects actual objectivation.
Included here is the profoundest of those sources on the basis of 
which the universality of the logical, ultimately that of the predicative 
judgment, is to be clarified (whereby we include the stratum of 
significational expressing, which has not yet been considered in 
detail), and on that foundation the ultimate ground of the univers- 
<245) ality of the supremacy of logic itself is also understood. In further 
consequence the possibility, indeed the necessity, is conceived of 
moral and material noetic or noematic and ontological disciplines 
essentially related to emotional and volitional intentionality. We 
shall take up this theme later on after we have ascertained a few 
supplementary cognitions.72

§118. Syntheses of Consciousness. Syntactical Forms,73
If now we turn our attention to the second of the directions indicated 
above,74 to the forms of synthetical consciousness, then a multiplicity of 
modes of formations belonging to mental processes by means of 
intentive connections make their appearance in our horizon which, 
as eidetic possibilities, pertain in part to all intentive mental processes 
whatever, in part to the peculiarities of their particular genera. A 
consciousness and a consciousness are not only bound together uni­
versally, but they are combined into one consciousness the correlate of 
which is one noema which, on its side, is founded on the noemas of the 
combined noeses.
We have not aimed at, here, the unity of consciousness of immanental 
time, although that must be remembered too as the all-embracing 
unity for all mental processes belonging to the stream of mental 
processes and, more particularly, as a unity of consciousness combining 
consciousness with consciousness. If we take any particular mental 
process, it is thus constituted as a unity spread out in phenomenolog­
ical time in the continual consciousness “originaliter” of time. We 
can, in the case of a suitable reflective attitude, take heed of the 
modes of givenness for consciousness of the extents of mental pro­
cesses belonging to segments of the duration of mental processes; and 
we can, accordingly, say that the whole consciousness constituting 
this duration-unity is continually composed of segments in which the 
segments of the duration of mental processes are constituted; and 
that therewith the noeses are not only combined but one noesis is 
constituted with one noema (the fulfilled duration of the mental 
process) which is founded on the noemas of the combined noeses.
W hat holds for a particular mental process also holds for the whole 
stream of menial processes. No m atter how alien in essence mental 
processes can be with respect to one another, they are nonetheless 
constituted altogether as one temporal stream, as members in the one 
phenomenological time.
Nevertheless, we have excluded this primal synthesis of conscious- <246) 
ness originaliter of time (which is not to be thought of as an active and 
discrete synthesis) along with the set of problems belonging to it. We 
shall now speak, therefore, of syntheses not in the framework of

consciousness of time, but instead in the framework of tune itself‘ the 
concretely fulfilled phenomenological time, taken 
as we have 
always taken it up to now — as enduring unities, as events receding 
into the stream of mental processes which itself is nothing else than 
the fulfilled phenomenological time. On the other hand, we do not 
even enter into the very important continuous syntheses, in any case, 
such as those, for example, which essentially belong to all conscious­
ness constituting spatial physicalness. Later on we shall find ample 
opportunity to become more precisely acquainted with these syn­
theses. O ur interest is turned, rather, to many-memberedsyntheses, thus 
to the peculiar modes in which discretely separated acts are com­
bined into a membered unity, into a synthetical act of a higher 
hierarchical order. In the case of a continuous synthesis we do not 
speak of an “act of a higher order;”75 rather the unity (noetic as well 
as well as noematic and objective) belongs to the same hierarchical 
order as the unified. It is easy to see, moreover, that many of the 
universal considerations to follow concern in the same way con­
tinuous as well as membered - - pohthetical - syntheses.76
Examples of synthetical acts ofa higher level are offered to us in the 
volitional sphere by the willing relating to “someone else’s sake;” 
similarly, in the realm of the emotional acts, the liking with respect to, the 
being glad “in reference to ” or, as we can likewise say, “for the sake of 
someone else.” And thus for all similar act-occurrences in the case of 
different act-genera. Obviously, all acts of preference belong here too.
We will subject to closer consideration another group of syntheses, 
universal in a certain fashion. It comprises collecting (taking to­
gether), disjunctive (concerning the “this or that” ), explicating, relating 
syntheses; taken universally, <the group comprises> the whole series of 
syntheses which, according to the pure forms of the synthetical 
objectivities being constituted in them, determine the formal- 
ontological forms, and, on the other side, with respect to the structure 
<247) of the noematic formation are mirrored in the apophantic sigrrijica- 
tiona! forms belonging to formal logic {the exclusively noematicallv direc­
ted logic of propositions).
The relation to formal ontology and logic already indicates that it is 
a matter there of an essentially determined closed group of syntheses 
which acquire an unconditioned universality of possible application

with respect to the species of mental processes to be combined which, 
on their side, should therefore be noetic unities of whatever 
complexity.
§119. The Transmutation of Polythetical into Monothetical Acts.
The following must be noted, first of all, with regard to all species of 
membered syntheses, of polythetical acts:
No matter how many particular positings and syntheses may be 
fitted into it, each synthetically unitary consciousness possesses the 
total object belonging to it as a synthetically unitary consciousness. It 
is called a total object in contrast to the objects which intentionally 
pertain to the synthetical members of a lower or higher level in so far 
as all of them also contribute to it in the fashion of founding and are 
fitted into it. Each noesis delimited in its own peculiar way, even if it 
were a non-selfsufficient stratum, makes its contribution to the con­
stitution of the total object; as, for example, the moment of valuing 
which is non-selfsufficient since it is necessarily founded on a consci­
ousness of a mere thing, and which constitutes the objective value- 
stratum, that of “value-quality.”
New strata of this sort are also the specific synthetical ones of the 
previously designated, most universal consciousness-syntheses, that 
is to say, all the forms which specifically stem from synthetical 
consciousness as synthetical, thus the forms of combination and the 
synthetical forms inherent in the members themselves (in so far as 
they are included in the syntheses).
We said that a total synthetical object is constituted in synthetical 
consciousness. But it is “objective” therein in a quite different sense 
than what is constituted in a simple positing. Synthetical conscious­
ness, or the pure Ego “in” it, is directed by many rays to something 
objective; the positional consciousness simpliciter is <directed to 
something objective by one ray. Thus synthetical collecting is a 
“plural” consciousness; it is one and one and one taken together. 
Similarly, in a primal relating consciousness the relation is con­
stituted in a two-fold positing. And likewise everywhere.
1 o every such many-raved (polythetical) constituting of synthet 
ical objectivities 
which, according to their essence can become 
intended to “originaliter” only synthetically 
there 
accor
ing to eidetic law, the possibility of converting what is intended to in many

rays into what is intended to simpliciter in one ray, the possibility of “making 
objective” in a “monothetical” act in thespecijic sense what is constituted 
synthetically in the first act.
The synthetically constituted collection thus becomes objective in 
a distinctive sense, it becomes an object of a simple doxic positing in 
the relation of a simple positing back to the collection just constituted 
originaliter, thus in an appertinent noetic attaching of a positing to 
the synthesis. In other words: The plural consciousness, in conformity with 
its essence, can become converted into a singular consciousness which draws 
the plurality from <the plural consciousness> as one object, as some­
thing single; on its side, the plurality now can be combined with other 
pluralities and other objects become posited in a relationship to 
them; and so forth.
Structured in a way wholly analogous with the collecting consci­
ousness, the situation is the same for disjunctive consciousness and its 
ontic or noematic correlates. Similarly, the synthetically-originally 
constituted relationship can be drawn from the relating consciousness in 
a simple positing attached to it, and be made an object in a distinctive 
sense; and as an object in a distinctive sense it may be compared with 
other relationships and, taken universally, become applied as a 
subject of predicates.77
But it must be made fully evident in that connection that what is 
presentiated simpliciter and what is synthetically unitary are really 
the same, and that the subsequent positing, or the extracting, rather 
than attributing anything to the synthetical consciousness, seizes 
instead upon what this presents. Also evidential is, certainly, the 
essentially different mode of givenness.
This conformity to laws is evinced in logic by the law o fi(nomi- 
n a liza tio n according to this law, something nominal corresponds to 
every proposition and to every component form distinguishable in 
the proposition: the nominal that-proposition corresponds to the 
proposition itself, let us say, to “S is p;” e.g., in the subject-place of 
new propositions being-P corresponds to “is p,” similarity corre­
sponds to the relationship-form “similar,” plurality to the plural- 
<249) form; and so forth.78

Conceived as exclusively determined by the pure forms, the con­
cepts which have issued from “nominalization” fashion formal- 
categorial variations in the idea of any objectivity whatever and supply the 
fundamental conceptual material of formal ontologies and all of the 
formal-mathematical disciplines they include. This proposition is of 
decisive importance for understanding the relations between formal 
logic, as logic of apophansis, and the universal formal ontology.
§ 120. Positionality and Neutrality in the Sphere of Syntheses.
All syntheses proper, and those are the ones we have had in view all 
along, are built up on positings simpliciter— taking this term in the 
universal sense established above where it comprises all “intentions,” 
all “act-characteristics;” and syntheses themselves are positings, posit­
ings of a higher level.79 Everything which we have ascertained about 
actuality and non-actuality, about neutrality and positionality, is 
extended, 
accordingly, 
to syntheses — which 
requires no 
explanation.
In contrast, a more precise investigation would be needed here in 
order to ascertain in which different ways the positionality and 
neutrality of founding positings are related to founded positings.
Universally, and not only for the specifically founded acts which 
we call syntheses, it is clear that one cannot say simply that a positing 
of a position of a higher level presupposes genuine positions posited at 
a lower level. Thus an actual seeing of an essence is indeed a 
positional act and not a neutralized act founded on some exempli- 
cative intuiting consciousness or other which, on its side, can very 
well be a neutral,80 a phantasy consciousness. Something similar is 
true for an aesthetic liking with respect to its appearing object, for a 
positional depicturing consciousness with respect to the depictured

image.
If, now, we observe the group of syntheses of interest to us, we 
immediately recognize the fact that every synthesis in the group is, with 
respect to its posited characteristic, dependent on the founding noeses; more
79 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : The concept of synthesis, moreover, has an ambiguity which is 
scarcely harmful in that sometimes it designates the full synthetical phenomenon and some­
times it designates the mere synthetical “act-characteristic, the highest positing of t e 
phenomenon.

<250) precisely, that it is positional (and can only be positional) if all the 
lower positings together are positional, and neutral if they are not.
For example, a collecting is an actual collecting or a collecting in 
the mode of “quasi;” it is an actual or neutralized positing. In the one 
case, all the acts related to the particular collection-members are 
actual positings, whereas in the other case they are not. The situation 
is the same for all other syntheses of the class mirrored in logical 
syntaxes. Pure neutrality can never function as positional synthesis; it 
must at least undergo transmutation into “suppositions,” perchance 
into hypothetical antecedents or consequents, into hypothetically 
supposed nominatives as, e.g., “pseudo Dionysius,”81 and other 
similar expressions.
§ 121. Doxic Syntaxes82 in the Emotional and Volitional Spheres.
If we now ask how the syntheses of this group come to be expressed in 
the syntactical forms of predicative propositions which the logical 
theory of forms has developed, then the answer is at hand. They are 
precisely, it will be said, doxic syntheses; or, as we may also say recalling 
the logical-grammatical syntaxes in which they are expressed, they 
are doxic syntaxes. Belonging to the specific essence of doxic acts are 
syntaxes of “and,” or the plural forms, the syntaxes of “or,” of the 
relating positing of a predicate to the substratum pertaining to a 
subject-positing; and so forth. No one can doubt that “belief’ and 
“judgm ent” in the logical sense are intimately related (even if one 
does not immediately identify them), that belief-syntheses find their 
“expression” in the forms of predicative propositions. However cor­
rect that may be, it is still to be seen that the interpretation indicated 
does not comprise in itself the whole truth. These syntheses of “and,” 
of “or,” of “if,” or of “because” and “ thus,” in short, the syntheses 
which first of all are presentive as doxic, are by no means merely doxic.
It is a fundamental fact83 that those syntheses also belong to the 
essence proper of non-doxic positings and that they do so, more 
particularly, in the following sense.

83 a u t h o r 's  bOOTNOTE: The author ran up against this fact (now more than ten years ago) in 
the attempt to realize the idea of a formal axiology and theory of practice as analogues of formal 
logic. [Reading, with Schuhmann, Idee instead o/Tdeen as in all printed editions.]

Undoubtedly there is such a thing as a collective gladness, a <251) 
collective liking, a collective willing, etc. Or, as I usually express it, 
there is besides the doxic “and” (the logical “and” ) an axiological 
and practical “and.” The same holds for the “or” and all the 
syntheses belonging here. For example: the mother who looks lov­
ingly upon her flock of children, embraces each child singly and all 
together in one act of love. The unity of the collective act of loving is 
not a loving and, in addition, a collective objectivating, even if it is 
attached to the loving as its necessary foundation. Loving, instead, is 
itself collective; it is, similarly, as many-rayed as the objectivating 
and perhaps the plural judging “underlying” it. We should speak of a 
plural loving in precisely the same sense as we speak of a plural 
objectivating, or judging. The syntactical forms enter into the es­
sence of the emotional acts themselves, namely into the positional 
stratum specifically peculiar to them. This cannot be carried out for 
all syntheses; the example given suffices for an indication.
But let us now recall for ourselves the eidetic affinity investigated 
above between doxic positings and positings taken universally. A 
parallel doxic positing is included in any positing whatever, in 
conformity to what it produces noematically, e.g., as this love- 
intention. Obviously, the parallelism between the spheres pertaining 
to the doxic positings and those pertaining to all other positings (the 
parallelism of the doxic “and,” “or,” etc., with the “and,” “or,” of 
valuing and willing) is a special case of the same eidetic affinity. For 
the synthetical emotional acts -  synthetical, namely, with respect to 
the syntactical forms explicated here — constitute synthetical emotional 
objectivities which are objectivated by the corresponding doxic acts.
The flock of children loved is, as love-Object, a collectivum; in the 
correlative application of what was explained above, that signifies 
not only a material collectivum and in addition a love, but a love- 
collectivum'. Just as, in a noetic respect, a ray of love emanating from 
the Ego is distributed among a bundle of rays each of which bears 
upon a particular object, so the many noematic love-characteristics are 
distributed among the love-collectivum as particular objects collec­
ted, and there are just as many posited characteristics which are 
synthetically combined into the noematic unity of a positional char­
acteristic.
We see that all of these syntactical forms are parallel forms, that is 
to say, that they belong as much to the emotional acts themse ves 
with their specific emotional components and emotional synt eses

do also the doxic positionalities which run parallel to them and form 
an eidetic unity with them, which are extracted from them by the 
appropriate turning of one’s regard to the particular substrata and 
superstrata. Naturally, what is true for the noetic sphere is transfer- 
ed to the noematic sphere. The axiological “and” essentially in­
cludes in itself a doxic “and,” every axiological syntactical form of 
the group considered here <includes> a logical syntactical form>: 
precisely just as every noematic correlate simpliciter includes in itself 
a “being” or another being-modality and, as its substratum, the form 
of “something” and the forms which otherwise pertain to it. Each 
time it is a m atter of essentially possible turnings of one’s regard and 
of the co-included positional and synthetical-doxic procedures for 
fashioning a new act on the basis of an emotional act in which we 
wholly live, so to speak, only emotionally, thus without actualizing 
the doxic potentialities — a new act in which the only potential 
emotional objectivity for the present is converted into an actual doxic 
and possibly expressly explicit <objectivity>. It is possible, accord­
ingly, and not unusual in empirical life that, for example, we consider 
many intuitive objects, positing them doxically; that, accordingly, 
we effect a synthetical emotional act at the same time — perhaps the 
unity of collective liking, or the unity of a selective emotional act, of a 
preferential liking, of a repudiating disliking; and all the while we do 
this, by no means do we go on to turn the whole phenomenon into a 
doxic phenomenon. But we do effect that turn when we make a 
statement, e.g., about our liking of the many, or of the one in the 
many, about our preference for the one over against the others; and 
so forth.
It need not be emphasized how important the careful carrying out 
of such analyses is for cognizing the essence of axiological and 
practical objectivities, significations and modes of consciousness, 
therefore for the problems of the “origin” of ethical, aesthetical 
concepts and cognitions as well as those eidetically akin to them.
Because it is not our proper task here to solve phenomenological 
problems, but rather to work out scientifically the principal pro­
blems of phenomenology and to predelineate the directions of in­
vestigation cohering with them, we must be satisfied with having 
carried the matters under discussion this far.84

§122. Modes of Effectuation of the Articulated Syntheses. “ Theme.”85
There belongs to positings and syntheses an important group of 
universal modifications, a brief indication of which we had best add 
here.
A synthesis can be effected step by step; it becomes, it arises in original 
production. This originarity of becoming in the stream of consciousness 
is a quite peculiar one. The positing and synthesis become while the 
pure Ego actionally takes one step and each new step; the Ego itself 
lives in the step and “steps forth” with it. The positing, the positing- 
thereupon, positing antecedently and consequently, etc., is its free 
spontaneity and activity; the Ego does not live in the positings as 
passively dwelling in them; <the positings> are instead radiations from 
the <pure Ego> as from a primal source of generations. Every positing 
begins with a point of initiation, with a positional point of origin; so it is 
with the first positing, as with every further one in the concatenation 
pertaining to the synthesis. This “initiation” belongs precisely to the 
positing as positing qua distinctive mode of original actionality. It is, 
perchance, like thejiat, like the initiating point of willing and acting.
Still, one should not confuse the universal with the particular. The 
spontaneous resolve, the purposive, accomplishing deed is one act 
among other acts; its syntheses are particular syntheses among 
others. But every act of no m atter what species can begin in the mode of 
spontaneity pertaining, so to speak, to its creative beginning in which the pure 
Ego makes its appearance as the subject of the spontaneity.
This mode of initiating is immediately, and according to an eidetic 
necessity, converted into another mode. For example, perceptual 
seizing upon, taking hold of, are immediately and without a break 
changed into the “ having in one9s grip.”
Yet another new modal alteration ensues when the positing is a 
mere step toward a synthesis, when the pure Ego effects a new step, 
and when now, in the all-inclusive unity of the synthetical conscious­
ness, it “still keeps” in grip what it just had in its grip: seizing upon the 
new thematic Object, or rather seizing upon a new member of the 
total theme as primary theme, but still holding on to the member 
previously seized upon as belonging to the same total theme. For

example, in collecting I do not allow what I just perceptually seized 
upon to escape while I turn the seizing regard to the new Object.
<254) Demonstrating an argument, step by step I run through the thoughts 
which are premises; I abandon no synthetical step that I have 
acquired, nor do I lose my grip on it; however, the mode of action­
ality has essentially changed with the effectuation of the new thema­
tic primal actionality.
In that connection it is also, though not merely, a m atter of ob­
scurations. The differences we have just tried to describe rather 
exhibit a completely new dimension in contradistinction to the 
differences of clarity and unclarity, although both sets of differences 
are quite closely interwoven.
We may further observe that these new differences fall under the 
law of the correlation of noesis and noema no less than those of clarity 
and all other differences in intentionality. Thus, again, the noetic 
actionality-modifications correspond to the species of noematic 
modifications which belong here. For example: the mode of given­
ness of the “meant as m eant” changes in the variation of positing, or 
in the steps of the synthesis, and one can show these changes in the 
particular noematic content and make them salient in it as a stratum 
proper.
When the actionality-mode (stated noematically, the givenness- 
mode) - disregarding the changes in continuous flux — necessarily 
varies according to certain discrete types, there still always remains 
throughout the variations something essentially common. Noemat­
ically, a W hat is preserved as the identical sense; on the noetic side, 
the correlate of this sense, furthermore the whole form of articulation 
according to positing and synthesizing.
However, a new eidetic modification now occurs. The pure Ego 
can withdraw wholly from the positing; it releases the positional corre­
late from its “g r i p “adverting to another theme.” W hat was a moment 
ago still its theme (theoretical, axiological, and so forth), with its 
articulations, even though more or less obscured, has not disap­
peared from consciousness; it is still intended to, but no longer in the 
thematic grip.
This holds likewise for isolated positings as well as for members of 
synthesizings. While thinking about something, a whistle from the 
street momentarily distracts me from my theme (here the theme of 
my thinking). For a moment I advert to the noise, but then im­
mediately return to the old theme. The seizing upon the noise has not

been effaced, the whistle is still intended to in a modified way; 
however, it is no longer in my tnental grip. It does not belong to the 
theme, nor even to a parallel theme. Note that this possibility of <255) 
simultaneously, perhaps mutually “penetrating99 and “disruptive99 
themata and of thematic syntheses, refers to still further possible 
modifications; we note then how the heading “ theme 99 related to all 
basic species of acts and act-syntheses, makes up an important theme 
of phenomenological analysis.
^ 123. Confusion and Distinctness as Modes of Effectuation of Synthetical Acts.
I ,et us now consider further the modalities of effectuation which, so to 
speak, lie in a converse direction from the preferred mode of action­
ality arising originaliter. A thought, furnished with simple or mani­
fold positings, can arise as “confused.99 It is then given as a simple 
presentation without any actional-positional articulation. Perhaps 
we recall a proof, a theory, a conversation — it “just comes to mind.”
At first we do not even advert to it; it comes up “in the background.”
Then a regard of the Ego is directed to it in a single ray, seizing upon 
the noematic objectivity in question in an unmembered grip. Now a 
new process can begin, the confused recollection being converted 
into a distinct and clear one: step by step we remember the course of 
the proof, we “regenerate” the positings and synthesizings pertain­
ing to the proof, we “recapitulate” the stages of yesterday’s conver­
sation, and so forth. Naturally, such reproduction by way of re­
collection, of regeneration of "earlier” originary generations, is 
something non-essential. Perhaps a new theoretical idea for carrying 
out a complicated theory comes to mind in a unitary but confused 
way, which is then developed in freely effected steps and transformed 
into synthetical actualities. Everything indicated is without question 
to be related in the same way to all species of act.
This important difference between confusion and distinctness plays a 
significant role in the phenomenology of “expressings,” explicit 
objectivatings, judgings [Urteile\, emotional acts, etc., which we have 
yet to examine. We need only think of the way in which we are 
accustomed to seize upon very complex, synthetical formations 
making up the “intellectual content” of our reading at a given time, 
and reflect on what, in the understanding of what we have rea , 
comes to actual originary actualization with respect to the so-ca e 
intellectual foundations of expressions.

<256) §124. 
The Noetic-Noematic Stratum of “Logos” Signifying and 
Signification.
Interwoven with all the acts considered before are the expressive 
act-strata, which are ‘'logical0 in the specific sense, in which the 
parallelism between noesis and noema is to be made evident no less 
than in the other acts. The universal and unavoidable ambiguity of 
locutions conditioned by this parallelism, and shown to be at work 
wherever the relevant relationships are expressed in language, is, 
naturally, also found in the terms expression and signification. The 
ambiguity is dangerous only as long as one does not recognize it as 
dangerous, or else has not separated the parallel structures. But if 
that occurs, care must be taken so that there can be no doubt as to 
which of the structures the terms ought to be referred.
VVe begin with the familiar distinction between the sensuous, so to 
speak, the corporeal side of the expression, and its non-sensuous or 
“m ental” side. We need not enter into a closer examination of the 
first side; likewise, we need not consider the manner of unifying both 
sides. Obviously they too designate headings for not unimportant 
phenomenological problems.
We shall restrict our regard exclusively to “signifying” and “sig­
nification.” Originally, these words concerned only the linguistic 
sphere, that of “expressing.” But one can scarcely avoid and, at the 
same time, take an important cognitive step, extending the sig­
nification of these words and suitably modifying them so that they 
can find application of a certain kind to the whole noetic-noematic 
sphere: thus application to all acts, be they now combined with 
expressive acts or not.86 Thus we have continued to speak of “sense” 
in the case of all intentive mental processes — a word which is used in 
general as equivalent to “signification.” For the sake of distinctness 
we shall prefer the term signification for the old concept and, in 
particular, in the complex locution of “logical” or “expressive” sig­
nification. We shall continue to use the word sense as before in the most 
all-inclusive range.
For example: an object is present to perception with a determined 
<257) sense, posited monothetically in determined fullness. As is our

normal custom after first seizing upon something perceptually, we 
effect an explicating of the given and a relational positing which 
unifies the parts or moments singled out — perhaps according to the 
schema, “This is white.” This process does not require the minimum 
of “expression,” nor of expression in the sense of verbal sound, nor of 
anything like a verbal signifying, the latter also being capable of 
being present independently of the verbal sound (as when this would 
be “forgotten” ). But if we have “thought” or asserted, “This is white,” 
then a new stratum is co-present, unified with the purely perceptu­
ally “meant as m eant.” In this fashion anything remembered as 
remembered, anything phantasied as phantasied, is also explicatable 
and expressable. Anything “meant as m eant,” anything m^ant in 
the noematic sense (and, more particularly, as the noematic core) 
pertaining to any act, no m atter which, is expressable by means of 
“significations.” Quite universally we may say:
Logical signification is an expression.
The verbal sound can only be called an expression because the 
signification belonging to it expresses; expressing inheres in it 
originaliter. "Expression” is a distinctive form which allows for 
adapting to every “sense” (to the noematic “core” ) and raises it to 
the realm of “Logos,” of the conceptual and, on that account, the 
“ universal.”
As a consequence, the last words are understood in a quite deter­
minate signification to be separated from other significations of these 
words. Universally, what has just been indicated designates a major 
theme for phenomenological analysis which is fundamental for eidet- 
ically clarifying logical thinking and its correlates. In the noetic 
respect, a particular act-stratum should be designated under the 
heading of “expressing” to which, in their own peculiar way, all 
other acts are to conform and with which they are to fuse in a 
distinctive manner so that every noematic act-sense, and conse­
quently the relationship to objectivity lying in it, is “conceptually” 
stamped on the noematic correlate of the expressing. An appertinent 
intuitional medium is present which, according to its essence, has the 
distinction, so to speak, of mirroring every other intentionality ac­
cording to form and content, depicturing it in its own colors and 
hence imprinting on it its own form of “conceptuality. To be sure, 
these locutions of mirroring or depicturing imposed upon us are to be 
taken with care since their metaphorical use can easily lead to error.
Extraordinarily difficult problems are related to the phenomena <25

subsumed under the headings of “signifying” and “signification.”87 
Because every science is objectivated in the specifically “ logical” 
medium, in that of expression, in accord with its theoretical content 
and with everything which is “doctrine” in it (theorem, proof, 
theory), the problems of expression and signification are the most 
immediate for philosophers and psychologists guided by universal 
logical interests; and they are, therefore, the first to require a phenom­
enological inquiry into essence as soon as one seriously comes to 
seek out their ground.88 From there, on that basis, one is led to the 
question of how the “expressing” of the “expressed” is to be under­
stood, how expressive mental processes are related to non-expressive 
ones, and what the latter undergo in supervening expressings: one 
finds himself referred to their “intentionality,” to the “sense imma­
nent” in them, to the “m atter” and “quality” (i.e., the act- 
characteristic of the positing); <one is referred to>the difference be­
tween these senses, to the essential moments which lie in the pre­
expressed, and to the signification of the expressive phenomenon 
itself and its own moments; and so forth. In many ways, one still sees 
in the current literature how little justice is done to the major 
problems indicated here with respect to their full and profound sense.
Apart from the fact that it confers expression precisely on all other 
intentionalities, the stratum of expression - and this makes up its 
own peculiarity — is not productive. Or, if one wishes: its productivity, 
its noematic production, is exhausted in theexpressing and with the form of the 
conceptual which is introduced with <the expressions
As a consequence, the expressive stratum, with respect to the 
posited characteristic, is perfectly identical in essence with the 
stratum undergoing the expression, and in the coincidence takes up 
its essence into itself to such an extent that we call the expressive 
objectivating just objectivating itself, the expressive believing, 
<expressive> deeming likely, <expressive> doubting themselves, and as 
a whole, just believing, deeming likely, doubting; similarly, we call 
the expressive wishing or willing just wishing or willing. It is evident 
<259) that even the distinction between positionality and neutrality passes

88 
a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : In fact, this was the way in which the Logische Untersuchungen 
endeavored to penetrate into phenomenology. A second way, starting from the opposite side, 
namely from the side of experience and sensuous givenncss followed by the author since the 
beginning of the 1890’s, was not fully expressed in that work.

over into the expressive, and we have already considered it above. 
The expressive stratum can have no other qualified posited or neutral position 
than the stratum subject to the expression, and in the coincidence we find 
not two positions which are to be separated but only one position.
89The full clarification of the structures belonging here raises 
considerable difficulties. Already it is not easy to recognize that, after 
abstraction from the sensuous verbal sounds, a stratification of the 
kind we presuppose here is actually present, thus in every case — 
even in that of a thinking which is still quite unclear, empty, merely 
verbal — a stratum of expressive signifying and a substratum of the 
expressed; nor is it easy to understand the essential connections of 
these stratifications. For not too much should be expected of the 
metaphor stratification; expression is not something like a coat of 
varnish, or like a piece of clothing covering it over; it is a mental 
formation exercizing new intentive functions on the intentive sub­
stratum and which, correlatively, is subjected to the intentive func­
tions of the <substratum>. W hat this new metaphor signifies for its part 
must be studied in the phenomena themselves and in all their es­
sential modifications. O f particular importance is the understanding 
of the different sorts of “universality” which make their appearance 
there: on the one side, those which belong to each expression and 
moment of expression, also to the non-selfsufficient “is,” “not,” 
“and,” “if,” and so forth; on the other side, the universality of 
“universal names” such as “human being” in contrast to proper 
names such as “Bruno;” again, those which belong to an essence 
which, in itself, is syntactically formless in comparison to the different 
universalities of signification just touched upon.
§ 125. The Modalities of Effectuation in the Logical-Expressive Sphere and the 
Method of Clarification.
In order to clear up the difficulties indicated particular regard must 
obviously be directed to the differences in modes of actionality dealt 
with above:90 the modalities of act-effectuation which, like all posit­
ings and synthesizings, concern as well the expressive modalities. But
89 Marginal note to this part of the sentence in Copy A: false, th e  e x p re ssin g  p ro p e r is th e

this occurs in a double way. On the one hand, they concern the 
signification-stratum, the specifically logical itself; on the other 
hand, the founding substrata.
In the course of reading we can articulate and freely effect each 
signification; we can, as a consequence, synthetically connect sig­
nifications with significations in the predesignated way. In this 
effectuation of acts of signification in the mode ofproduction proper we acquire 
perfect distinctness of “logical” understanding.
This distinctness can be converted into confusion in all the modes 
described above: the sentence just read sinks into darkness, loses its 
living articulation, ceases to be our “ theme,” to be “still in grip.”
Such distinctness and confusion are, however, to be separated 
from that which affects the expressed substrata. A distinct under­
standing of word and sentence (or a distinct, articulated effectuation 
of the act of stating) is compatible with the confusion belonging to the 
substrata.91 This confusion does not signify mere unclarity, although it 
can also signify that. The substratum can be a confused unitary 
something (and often is) which does not actually include in itself its 
articulation; but instead it owes <its articulation> to mere adaptation 
to the stratum of the logical expression actually articulated and 
effected in original actionality.
T hat has a highly important methodological signification. We call 
attention to the fact that essential supplementations are needed by 
our earlier discussions about the method of clarification92 with respect to 
the proposition, which is the element oflife in science. It is now easy 
to designate what needs to be done in order to come from confused 
thinking to genuine and fully explicit cognizing, to distinct and, at 
the same time, clear effectuation of acts of thinking: In the first place, 
all “logical” acts ( those of signifying), in so far as they were still effected 
in the mode of confusion, are to be converted into the mode of 
originary, spontaneous actionality; thus perfect logical distinctness is to 
be established. But now the analogue is also to be produced in the 
grounding substratum, everywhere unliving is to be converted into the 
living, all confusion into distinctness, but also all non-intuitiveness 
into intuitiveness.93 Only when we perform this work <of conversion>

in the substratum — in the event that the incompatibilities becoming 
visible in it do not make further work superfluous — does the 
previously described method come into action, whereby account is to 
be taken of the fact that the concept of intuition, of clear conscious­
ness, is transferred from the monothetical to the synthetical acts.
Moreover, as a profounder analysis will show, it all depends on the 
species of evidence which should be acquired in each case, or else on the 
stratum to which the evidence is turned. All evidences related to pure- 
logical relations, to concatenations of essences of noematic significa­
tions — therefore those which we obtain from fundamental laws of 
formal logic — require precisely the givenness of significations, 
namely, the givenness of expressive posita of the forms prescribed by 
the law of signification in question. The non-selfsufficiency of sig­
nifications also brings it about that exemplification of the logically 
produced essence-formation mediating the evidence of the law also 
carries along with it substrata and, more particularly, those sub­
jected to logical expression; but these substrata need not be made clear when 
it is a matter of a pure-logical insight. Correspondingly modified, that 
holds for all “analytic” cognitions.94
§126. Completeness and Universality of Expression.
To be emphasized, furthermore, is the difference between complete 
and incomplete expression.95 The unity of something which expresses 
and something which is expressed in the phenomenon is, to be sure, 
that of a certain coincidence, although it is not necessary that the 
superstratum be expressively extended over the whole substratum. 
The expression is complete when it stamps all synthetical forms and 
materials of the substratum in a conceptual-significational way; it is in­
complete when it only partially does that: as when, with respect to a 
complex event, such as the arrival of a carriage, perhaps, bringing 
long-awaited guests, we shout in the house: the carriage! the guests!
— Obviously this difference of completeness cuts across that of 
relative clarity and distinctness.
An incompleteness wholly different from the one just mentioned is 
that which belongs to the essence of expression as expression, that is
94 Marginal note in Copy A: N.B.
95 a u t h o r 's f o o t n o t e : Cf. Logische Untersuchungen, n. 4. Unters., §§

to say, to its universality. “ I would like” universally expresses the wish; 
the form of the command, the command; “might well be” expresses 
the deeming likely, or what is deemed likely as likely; and so forth. 
Everything determined more precisely in the unity of expression is 
itself again expressed universally. It is inherent in the sense of the 
universality belonging to the essence of expressing that all the part- 
<262) iculars of the expressed can never be reflected in the expression. The 
stratum of signifying is not, and of essential necessity cannot be, a 
kind of reduplication of the substratum. Whole dimensions of varia­
bility in the substratum do not enter at all into the expressive 
signifying; they, or their correlates, do not indeed “express them­
selves” at all: thus the modifications of relative clarity and distinct­
ness, the attentional modifications, and so forth. But even in that 
which indicates the particular sense of the word expression there 
subsist essential differences, thus with respect to how the synthetical 
forms and the synthetical stuff find expression.
Reference is also to be made here to the “non-selfsufficiency” of all 
forms of significations and all “syncategorematic” significations 
taken universally. The isolated “and,” “if,” the isolated genitive “of 
the heavens,” are comprehensible and yet are non-selfsufficient and 
in need of completion. The question here is what this need of 
completion signifies, what it signifies with respect to both strata and 
in retrospect of the possibilities of incomplete signifying.96
§ 127. The Expression ofJudgments and the Expression of Emotional Noemas.
All these points must be clarified if one of the oldest and most difficult 
of problems pertaining to the sphere of signification is to be solved — 
a problem which has remained without solution until now precisely 
because it has lacked the requisite phenomenological insights: the 
problem of how statings as the expressions of judging are related to the 
expressing of other sorts of acts. We have expressive predications in which 
a “thus it is!” is expressed. We have expressive deemings likely, 
askings, doubtings, expressive wishes, commands; etc. Verbally, we 
find here proposition-forms structured in the way peculiar to them 
but which are to be interpreted ambiguously: along with predicative
96a u t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : Cf. Ibid., §5, p p  296-307 [Second edition, p p . 305-316; English 
translation, p p . 501-509.]

propositions there are interrogative propositions, presumption- 
propositions, optative propositions, imperative propositions, etc. 
Leaving aside grammatical wordings and their historical forms, the 
original argument in that connection was related to whether or not 
all of these propositions with respect to their signification were not in 
truth predicative propositions. In the latter case, all pertinent act- 
formations, e.g., those of the emotional sphere which, in themselves, 
are not acts ofjudging, would only be able to come to “expression” in 
a roundabout way by means of a judging founded on them.
Nonetheless, the whole relation of the problem to the acts, the <263) 
noeses, is insufficient, and the continual overlooking of the noemata 
to which the regard is directed just in such reflections on significa­
tions, hinders the understanding of these affairs. In order to be able to 
penetrate to the correct setting of the problem, universally it is 
necessary to refer to the different structures we have indicated: the 
universal cognition of the noetic and noematic correlations as one 
which pervades all intentionalities, all posited and synthesized 
strata; likewise the separation of the logical signification-stratum 
from the substratum to be expressed by it; furthermore, the insight 
here, as elsewhere in the intentive sphere, into the essentially possible 
directions of reflection and the directions of modifications; but, 
specifically, there is needed the insight into the ways in which each 
consciousness is converted into a judgmental consciousness, just as 
predicatively formed affair-complexes of noetic and noematic kinds are to 
be drawn from every consciousness. The radical problem back to which 
we are finally led, as it emerges from the concatenation of the whole 
series of the last problem-analyses, is to be formulated as follows:
Is the medium of expressive signifying, this appertinent medium of the 
Logos, a specifically doxic one? In the adaptation of the signifying to the 
signified, does it not coincide with the doxic itself inherent in all positionality?
O f course that would not exclude the fact that many modes of 
expression, let us say of emotional mental processes, are given. One of 
them would be the direct, i.e., simple expressions of mental processes 
(or for the correlative sense of the word expression, its noema) by the 
immediate adaptation of a membered expression to the membered 
emotional mental process whereby the doxic coincides with the 
doxic. The doxic form inherent in the emotional mental process with 
respect to all components would thus be what makes possible the 
adaptability of the expression, as an exclusively doxo-positional 
mental process, to the emotional mental process which, as emo-

tional and according to all its members, is multi-positing but also 
necessarily including doxo-positional <members>.
More precisely stated, this direct expression, if it is to be a faithful 
and complete expression, would only accrue to doxic, non-modalized 
mental processes. If, in wishing, I am uncertain, it is then incorrect to 
say in direct adaptation: May S be p. For all expressing is, in the sense 
<264) of the foundational apprehension, a doxic act in the pregnant sense, 
i.e., a certainty of believing.97It can, therefore, only express cer­
tainties (e.g., wish-certainties, volitional certainties).98 In cases of 
that kind, the expression is only produced as indirectly faithful, 
perchance in the form: “Perhaps S may be p.” As soon as modalities 
make their appearance, in order to acquire the most suitable ex­
pression possible it is necessary to recurr to the doxic positings with 
changed positional material which lie, so to speak, hidden in them.
If we grant this interpretation as a correct one, then the following 
must still be pointed out by way of supplement:
There are at all times a number of possibilities of indirect expressions 
with “periphrases.” To the essence of any objectivity as objectivity, 
be it constituted by no m atter which acts, be the acts simple or 
complex and synthetically founded acts, there belong various possi­
bilities of relating explication: thus different acts can follow upon any 
act, e.g., an act of wishing, related to it, to its noematic objectivity, to 
its entire noema; concatenations of subject-positings, of predicate- 
positings posited thereupon in which, perchance, what is meant in 
the original act of wishing is judgmentally unfolded and correspond­
ingly expressed. The expression is then not adapted to the pheno­
menon originaliter, but instead directly to that which is predicatively 
derived from it.
In this connection it is always necessary to note that, <on the one 
side> explicative or analytic synthesis 
(judgment prior to 
the 
conceptual-significational expression), on the other side statement

§128. Introduction.
The phenomenological excursions of the last chapter have led us into 
almost all spheres of intentionality. Guided by the radical point of 
view of the distinction between analysis of the really inherent and 
intentional analysis, between noetic and noematic analysis, we en­
countered in all cases structures which always and again became 
newly ramified. In the case of this distinction, we can no longer avoid 
the insight that it is indeed a m atter of a fundamental structure 
pervading all intentional structures which must, therefore, deter­
mine a governing Leitmotiv of phenomenological methods and the 
course of all inquiries into problems of intentionality.
With this distinction it is clear at the same time that there becomes 
salient a distinction between two realms of being which are radically 
opposed and yet essentially related to one another. We emphasized 
earlier that consciousness taken universally must be accepted as a 
proper region of being. We recognized then, however, that eidetic 
description of consciousness leads back to that of what is intended to 
in it, that the correlate of consciousness is inseparable from conscious­
ness and yet is not really inherent in it. The noematic became 
distinguished as an objectivity belonging to consciousness and yet 
specifically peculiar. In that connection, we notice that while objects 
simpliciter (understood in the unmodified sense) stand under funda­
mentally different highest genera, all object-senses and all noemas 
taken completely, no matter how different they may be otherwise, 
are of essential necessity of one single highest genus. It then also 
obtains, however, that the essences, Noema and Noesis, are insep­
arable from one another: Infima species on the noematic side eidet- 
ically point back to infima species on the noetic side. That becomes 
extended naturally to all formations of genus and species.

Cognitions of the essential two-sidedness of intentionality, accord­
ing to noesis and noema, have the consequence that a systematic 
<266) phenomenology is not allowed to direct its aim one-sidedly at an 
analysis of what is really inherent in mental processes and specifically 
of intentive mental processes. The temptation to do so is, however, 
very great at the beginning because the historical and natural course 
from psychology to phenomenology brings with it that one under­
stands the study of what is immanent in pure mental processes, the 
study of their own essence, as without question a study of their really 
inherent components.1 In truth there become opened up in respect of 
both sides great provinces of eidetic research which are continually 
related to one another and which yet, as comes to light, are separated 
with respect to broad extents. In great measure what one has held to 
be act-analysis, noetic analysis, is gained entirely from the direction 
of regard to the “meant as m eant,” and thus it was noematic 
structures which one described in that analysis.
In our next considerations it will be our purpose to direct our 
attention to the universal structure of the noema from a point of view 
which, up to now, has often been mentioned but was still not the 
guiding one for noematic analysis: The phenomenological problem of the 
relation of consciousness to an objectivity has primarily its noematic side. 
The noema in itself has an objective relation and, more particularly, 
by virtue ofits own “sense.” If we ask, then, how the consciousness- 
“sense” has access to the “object” which belongs to it and can be “the 
same” in manifold acts of very different content, how we see this in 
the sense, then new structures emerge the extraordinary significance 
of which is evident. For, progressing in this direction and, on the 
other side, reflecting on the parallel noeses, we finally confront the 
question of what the “claim” of consciousness actually to “relate” to 
something objective, to be “well-founded,” properly signifies, of how 
“valid” and “invalid” objective relations become phenomenologi- 
cally clarified according to noesis and noema: and with that we 
confront the great problems of reason, the clarification of which within 
the realm of phenomenology, the formulation of which as phenomen­
ological problems, will become our aim in this <fourth> part of <the 
First Book>.
1 
a u t h o r ’s f o o tn o te : That is still the focus of the Logische Untersuchungen. However great the 
extent to which the nature of the matters themselves compels the carrying out of noematic 
analyses, the noemas are nevertheless regarded more as indices for the parallel noetic struc­
tures; the essential parallelism of the two structures has not yet attained clarity there.

§129. “Content" and “Object;" the Content as “Sense."
In our previous analyses a universal noematic structure played its 
continuous role, designated by the separation of a certain noematic <267) 
"core" from the changing “characteristics" belonging to it <and> with 
which the noematic concretion appears involved in the flow of 
different sorts of modifications. This core has not yet received its 
scientific due. It was intuitionally, unitarily, and clearly salient so 
that we could refer to it in general. Now the time has come to consider 
it more closely and place it at the center of phenomenological 
analysis. As soon as one does that, universally significant differences 
running throughout all act-species emerge which are guiding for 
great groups of investigations.
We begin with the usual equivocal verbal reference to the content 
of consciousness. As content we take the “sense,” of which we say that 
in or through it consciousness relates to something objective as “its” 
something objective. So to speak, as title and aim of our discussions 
we take the propositions:
Each noema has a “content" that is to say, its “sense,” and is related 
through it to “its” object.
In recent times one often hears it praised as a great advance, that 
now at last the foundation-laying differentiation among act, content, 
and object has been attained. The three words in this juxtaposition 
have 
become 
nothing short 
of slogans, 
particularly since 
Twardowski’s fine treatise.2 Yet, however great and doubtless the 
service of this author in having acutely discussed certain generally 
ordinary confusions and made their error evident, it must still be said 
that in the clarification of the relevant conceptual essence he did not 
get considerably beyond what was well-known to the philosophers of 
earlier generations (despite their incautious confusions). This is not, 
perchance, to be charged to him as a fault. A radical advance was just 
not at all possible before a systematic phenomenology of conscious­
ness. With phenomenologically unclarified concepts such as “act,” 
“content,” “object” of the “objectivatings,” nothing is of help to us.
What is there which cannot be called “act" and especially which 
cannot be called “content of an objectivating,” and an “objectivat­
ing?” And what can be called so must itself be cognized scientifically.
2 
a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  K. 'Twardowski, ^ur Lek™ von Inholt und Gegenstdndder Vorstellungen [On 
the Theory of the Content and the Object of Objectivatings) (Vienna, 1894).

In this respect a first and, as it would appear to me, necessary step 
was attempted by means of the phenomenological distinguishing of 
“m atter” and “quality” by means of the idea of the “intentional 
essence” in its distinction from the “cognitional essence.” The one­
sidedness of the noetic direction of regard in which these differen- 
<268) tiations were made and meant becomes easily overcome by taking 
into consideration the noematic parallels. We can therefore under­
stand the concepts as noematic; the “quality” (judgment-quality, 
wish-quality, and so forth) is nothing else than that which we have 
dealt with up to now as “posited” characteristic \“Setzungs” Charakter, 
“ thetischen” Charakter] in the broadest sense. The expression, orginat- 
ing from contemporary psychology (Brentano’s), appears to me now 
hardly suitable; each specifically peculiar position has its quality but 
it is not itself to be designated as quality. Obviously now the 
“m atter,” which is, in the particular case, the “what” which receives 
the posited characteristic, the “quality,” corresponds to the “noe­
matic core.”
The task is now to systematically develop this beginning, to clarify 
it more deeply, to analyze these concepts further and to carry them 
through in all noetic-noematic provinces. Each actually successful 
advance in this direction must be of exceptional significance for 
phenomenology. It is indeed a question, not of side issues, but of 
essential moments belonging to the central structure of every in­
tentive mental process.
In order to approach matters more closely, let us begin with the 
following deliberation.
The intentive mental process, so one is accustomed to say, has 
“relation to something objectivebut one also says that it is “consciousness 
of something ” for example, a blossoming apple tree, the one here in 
this garden. To begin with, we shall not hold it to be necessary, in the 
light of such examples, to discriminate the two manners of speaking. 
If we recall the preceding analyses, we find the full noesis related to 
the full noema as its intentional and full What. It is then clear, 
however, that this relation cannot be the one m eant in speaking of 
the relation of consciousness to its intentional objective something; 
for to each noetic moment, especially to each positing noetic one, 
there corresponds a moment in the noema and, in the latter, there is 
set apart from the complex posited characteristics the noematic core 
characterized by them. If we recall, furthermore, the “regard-to” 
which, under circumstances, goes through the noesis (which goes

through the actional cogito) and which converts the specifically 
positing moments into rays of positing actionality of the Ego, and if 
we heed precisely how this Ego now with them “directs” itself to 
something objective as seizing upon being, as deeming likely, as 
wishing, how its regard goes through the noematic core — we then 
become attentive to the fact that, with the statements about the 
relation (and specifically the direction) of consciousness to its ob­
jective something, we are referred to an innermost moment of the <269) 
noema. It is not the just designated core itself but rather something 
else which, so to speak, makes up the necessary central point of the 
core and functions as “bearer” for noematic peculiarities specifically 
belonging to the core, that is to say, the noematically modified 
properties of the “meant as m eant.”
As soon as we go into it more precisely we are immediately 
cognitively aware that indeed the distinction between “content” and 
“object” is to be made not only for the “consciousness,” for the 
intentive mental process, but also for the noema taken in itself. Thus the 
noema too is related to an object and possesses a “content” by 
“means” of which it relates to the object; in which case the object is 
the same as that of the noesis; as then the “parallelism” again 
completely confirms itself.
§130. Delimitation of the Essence, “Noematic Sense."3
Let us bring these remarkable structures closer to us. We simplify the 
deliberation in such a way that we leave the attentional modifica­
tions out of consideration; we restrict ourselves further to positing acts 
in the positions of which we live, perhaps, according to the sequence 
oflevels of the founding — living sometimes in the one, sometimes in 
the other partial position while the others are, it is true, in effect but in 
a secondary function. That our analyses do not suffer in the least with 
respect to the universality of their validity by such simplifications is to 
be made evident subsequently and without further ado. We are 
concerned precisely with an essence which is insensitive to such 
modifications.
If we then put ourselves into a living cogito, it has, according to its
3 
Marginal note to title in Copy A: Matter in the sense of the Logische Untersuchungen; objective 
sense in the lectures.

essence and in a pre-eminent sense a “direction” to something 
objective. In other words, there belongs to its noema “something 
objective” — in inverted commas — with a certain noematic com­
position which becomes explicated in a description of determinate 
delimitation, that is to say, in such a description which, as a description 
of the “meant objective something, as it is meant ” avoids all “subjective” 
expressions. There formal-ontological expressions are applied, such as 
“object,” “determination,” <and> “predicatively formed affair- 
complex;” material-ontological expressions, such as “physical 
thing,” “bodily figure” [“Figur”], <and> “cause;” determinations 
with a material content, such as “rough,” “hard,” <and> “colored”
— 
all have their inverted commas, accordingly the noemat
modified sense. Excluded, in contrast, for the description of this meant 
objective something as meant are such expressions as “perceptual,” 
<270) “memorial,” “clearly intuited,” “conceptual,” and “given” — they 
belong to another dimension of descriptions, not to the objective 
something which is an object of consciousness, but to the mode in which 
it is an object of consciousness. In contrast, in the case of an appearing 
physical thing-Object, it would again fall in the bounds of the 
description to say: a “front side” is thus and so determined with respect 
to color, shape, etc., its “rear side” has “a color” but a “not further 
determined” one; the appearing physical thing-Object is, in these 
and those respects, altogether “undetermined” as to whether it is thus 
or so.
That is true not only in the case of objects belonging to Nature but 
quite universally; for example, in the case of objects with value. To 
their description belongs that of the meant “mere thing” and, in 
addition, the statement of the “value,” as when we say of the 
appearing tree, “according to the sense” of our valuing-meaning <of 
it>, it is covered with “delightfully” scented blossoms. Moreover, the 
value predicates too have their inverted commas; they are pre­
dicates, not of a valuable object [eines Wertes] simpliciter, but of a 
value noema.
With this, obviously, a quite fixed content in each noema is delimited. 
Each consciousness has its What and each means “its” objective 
something; it is evident that, in the case of each consciousness, we 
must, essentially speaking, be able to make such a noematic de­
scription of<“its” objective somethings “precisely as it is m eant;” we 
acquire by explication and conceptual comprehension a closed set of 
formal or material, materially determined or “undetermined” (“emp-

lily” meant4) “predicates” and these in their modified signification 
determine that “content” of the object-core of the noema which is 
spoken of.5
§131. The “Object ” the “Determinable X  in the Noematic Sense ”
The predicates are, however, predicates of “something ” and this 
‘‘something” also belongs, and obviously inseparably, to the core in 
question: it is the central point of unity of which we spoke above. It is 
the central point of connection or the “bearer” of the predicates, but 
in no way is it a unity of them in the sense in which any complex, any 
combination, of the predicates would be called a unity. It is neces­
sarily to be distinguished from them, although not to be placed 
alongside and separated from them; just as, conversely, they are its <271) 
predicates: unthinkable without it, yet distinguishable from it. We 
say that the intentional Object is continuously intended to in the 
continuous or synthetical course of consciousness but again and 
again “presents” itself “differently;” it is “the same;” it is only given in 
other predicates with a different determination-content; “it” shows 
itself only from different sides, whereby the predicates which re­
mained undetermined would have become more closely determined; 
or “the” Object has remained unchanged in this stretch of givenness, 
now however “it,” the identical, becomes altered, it increases in 
beauty through this alteration, it loses utility-value, and so forth. If 
this is always understood as noematic description of the currently meant 
as meant and if this description, as is possible at any time, is made in 
pure adequation, then the identical intentional “object” becomes 
evidently distinguished from the changing and alterable “predi­
cates.” It becomes separated as central noematic moment: the 
“object” [“Gegenstand”], the “ Object” [“Objekt”], the “Identical,” the 
“determinable subject of its possible predicates” — the pure X  in 
abstraction from all predicates — and it becomes separated from these 
predicates or, more precisely, from the predicate-noemas.
4 Addition in Copy A (published by Schuhmann as Appendix 66, ca. 1914): It would be well to add 
here that the situation naturally is not essentially different in the psychological sphere.
Subjects, such as persons, furthermore their psychical properties, their transitory or permanent 
dispositions, finally their perceptions and other psychical states, can become Objects, and there 
too the Objective something and its “subjective” mode of givenness are to be distinguished.
5 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  The emptiness of undetermined ness should not be confused with 
being devoid of intuition, the emptiness of the obscure objectivation.

With the one Object we coordinate multiple modes of conscious­
ness, acts, correlatively act-noemas. Obviously this is nothing ac­
cidental; no <Object> is conceivable without there also being con­
ceivable multiple intentive mental processes, connected in cont­
inuous or in properly synthetical (polythetical) unity — processes in 
which “it,” the Object, is intended to as an identical object and yet in 
a noetically different mode: such that the characterized core is a 
changeable one and the “object” , the pure subject of the predicating, 
is precisely an identical one. It is clear that we can regard each partial 
extent of the immanental duration of an act as an “act”6 and the total 
act as a certain harmonious unity of the continuously combined acts. 
We can say then: several act-noemata have here, throughout, different 
cores1, yet in such a manner that, in spite of this, they are joined together 
to make a unity of identity, to make a unity in which the “something,” 
the determinable which inheres in each core, is intended to as an 
identical “something.”
In just the same manner, however, separate acts, like, for example, 
two perceptions or a perception and a memory, can join together to 
make a “harmonious” unity and by virtue of the specific character of 
<272) this union, which is obviously not alien to the essence of the acts 
joined together, there is consciousness of the possibly at one time so 
and at another time otherwise determined something of the at first 
separated cores as the same something or as harmoniously the same 
“object.”
As a consequence, therefore, there is inherent in each noema a 
pure object-something as a point of unity and, at the same time, we 
see how in a noematic respect two sorts of object-concepts are to be 
distinguished: this pure point of unity, this noematic “object simpli­
citer 
and the “object in the How of its determinations— including 
undeterminednesses which for the time being “remain open” and, in 
this mode, are co-meant. This “How,” moreover, is to be taken 
precisely as that which the particular act prescribes, as which it 
consequently belongs actually to the noema <of the act>. The “sense,” 
of which we speak repeatedly, is this noematic “Object in the H ow ”

with all that which the description characterized above is able to find 
evidently in it and to express conceptually.
Let it be noted that now we cautiously said “sense,” not “core.”
For it will turn out that, in order to gain the actual, concretely 
complete core of the noema, we must take into account yet another 
dimension of differences which finds no expression in the character­
ized description <but> which defines the sense for us. If at first we keep 
here purely to that which this <description> comprehends, the “sense” 
is therefore a fundamental piece of the noema. Universally it is a 
piece which, under circumstances, changes from noema to noema, 
but <which> under circumstances <is> an absolutely like <piece> and 
perhaps even characterized as “identical,” in so far as the “object, in 
the How of determinations,” stands there on both sides as the same 
and as one to be described in an absolutely like manner. In no noema, 
however, can it or its necessary center, the point of unity, the pure 
determinable X, be missing. No “sense” without the “something” and, 
again, without “ determining content ” In that connection, it is evident 
that the subsequent analysis and description do not first introduce 
such a thing but rather that, as condition for the possibility of evident 
description and prior to this, it inheres actually in the correlate of 
consciousness.
Through the sense-bearer (as empty X) belonging to the sense and 
through the possibility of harmonious combination to make sense-unities of 
any level whatever — a possibility grounded in the essence of the sense
— not only does each sense have its “object” but also different senses 
relate to the same object, just as far as they are to be made members of <273) 
sense-unities in which the determinable X  of the united senses become 
coincident with one another and with the X  of the total sense of the particular 
unity of sense.
O ur exposition becomes extended from monothetical acts to syn­
thetical or, more distinctly, to polythetical acts. In a positing, many- 
membered consciousness each member has the described noematic 
structure; each has its X with the latter’s “determining content;”10 
but in addition to that the noema of the synthetical total act has, with 
respect to the “archontic”11 position, the synthetical X and its deter­
mining content. In the effecting of the act, the ray of the pure Ego’s

regard, dividing itself into a plurality of rays, goes to the X which 
arrives at synthetical unity. With the change we call “nominaliza- 
tion” the synthetical total phenomenon becomes modified in such a 
way that a ray of actionality goes to the highest synthetic X.
§132. The Core As a Sense in the Mode Belonging to its Fullness.12,
As we have determined it, the sense13 is not a concrete essence in the total 
composition of the noema but a sort of abstract form inherent in the 
noema. That is to say, if we hold the sense fast, consequently the 
“m eant,” precisely with the determination-content in which it is 
something meant, then clearly a second concept of the “object in its 
How” is yielded — <the object> in the How of its modes of givenness. If, in 
addition, we disregard all attentional modifications, all differences of 
the sort to which differences in the modes of effecting belong, there 
come into consideration — always within the preferred sphere of 
positionality — the differences in fullness of clarity, which are cogni- 
tionally so very determinative. Something intended to obscurely, as 
obscurely intended to, and the same thing as intended to clearly are, 
with respect to their noematic concreteness, very different, just as the 
whole mental processes are. But nothing stands in the way of the 
determination-content with which the thing intended to obscurely is 
meant being absolutely the same as the determination-content of the 
thing intended to clearly. The descriptions would coincide, and a 
synthetical unity-consciousness could envelop the consciousness on 
one side and that on the other in such a way that it was actually a 
matter of the same meant something. As full core we shall, accord­
ingly, count precisely the full concreteness of the noematic compo­
nent in question, consequently the sense in the mode belonging to its 
fullness.14

§133. The Noematic Positum. Posited and Synthetical Posita.15 Posita in the <274) 
Realm of Objectivations.
There would now be needed a careful carrying-through of these 
distinctions in all act-provinces as well as supplementary considera­
tion of the posited moments which have a peculiar relation to the sense 
as noematic. In the Logische Untersuchungen they were (under the title 
“quality” ) taken into the concept of sense (ofsignificational essence) 
and therefore in this unity the two components, “m atter” (sense, in 
the present conception) and quality, were distinguished.16 But it 
seems more suitable to define the term “sense” as merely that 
“m atter” and then to designate the unity of sense and posited 
characteristic as “positum.”17 We have then one-membered posita (as in 
the case of perceptions and other positional intuitions) and many- 
membered, synthetical posita, such as predicative doxic posita (judg­
ments), uncertain likelihood-posita with predicatively membered 
material, etc. One-membered as well as many-membered <posita> 
are, furthermore, liking-posita, wish-posita, command-posita, etc. The 
concept of the positum is accordingly indeed extraordinarily and 
perhaps surprisingly broadened, but nevertheless within the bounds 
of an important essential unity. Continually it is indeed to be kept in 
view that the concepts sense and positum contain for us nothing 
pertaining to expression and conceptual signification; on the other 
hand, however, they comprehend under themselves all explicit 
posita or, correspondingly, all posita-significations.
According to our analyses these concepts designate an abstract 
stratum belonging to the full web of all noemata. For our cognitions 
it is of great significance to gain this stratum in its fully comprehen­
sive universality, consequently to have the insight that it has its place 
actually in all act-spheres. Also in the case of intuitions simpliciter the 
concepts sense and positum have their necessary application, neces­
sarily the particular concepts intuition-sense and intuition-positum must

be coined. So, for example, in the province of perception of some­
thing external the object-sense, the physical thing-sense of this perception, 
which is a different sense (as well as with respect to “the same” 
physical thing) from perception to perception, is to be singled out 
intuitively from the “perceived object as perceived” by abstracting 
from the characteristic of perceivedness as something inhering in the 
<275) noema prior to all explicating and conceiving thinking. If we take 
this sense <in its> completion, with its intuitional/w//wm, a determined 
and very important concept of appearance results.18 To these senses 
correspond posita, intuition-posita, objectivation-posita, perceptual 
posita, and so forth. In a phenomenology of intuition of something 
external which, as phenomenology has to do, not with objects simpli­
citer in an unmodified sense, but with noemas as correlates of noeses, 
concepts like those brought out here stand at the center of scientific 
research.
If we first turn back to the general theme, the further task now 
arises of systematically distinguishing the fundamental sorts of senses, 
of simple and of synthetic senses (that is to say, of senses belonging to 
synthetical acts), of senses of the first and higher levels. Following 
partly the fundamental sorts of determinations with respect to con­
tent, partly the fundamental forms of synthetic formations playing 
their role for all significational provinces in a like manner, and thus 
taking into account everything which is, without exception, deter­
minative a priori for the general structure of senses with respect to form 
and content, all that is common to all spheres of consciousness or is 
peculiar to generically closed spheres — we ascend to the idea of a 
systematic and universal doctrine of the forms of senses (significations). If in 
addition to that we take into consideration the systematic distin­
guishing of posited characteristics, there is at the same time produced 
thereby a systematic description of the types of posita.19

§134. The Doctrine of Apophantic Forms.
It is a principal task here to project a systematic “analytic” doctrine of 
the forms of “ logical” significations, respectively such a doctrine of the 
forms of predicative posita, of “judgm ents” in the sense expressed by this 
word in formal logic, <a doctrine> which considers only the forms of 
analytic or predicative synthesis and leaves undetermined the sense-terms 
entering into these forms.20 Although this task is a special one, still it 
has universal significance because the heading, predicative synthesis, 
designates a class of operations possible with respect to all possible 
species of sense; everywhere, equally possible operations of explica­
tion and of relating apprehension of the explicated: as determination 
of the subject of determination, as part of the whole, as relatum ofits 
referent, and so forth. Combined with those <operations> are the <276) 
operations of collection, of disjunction, of hypothetical connection.
All of that prior to all statement and the explicit or “conceptual” 
comprehension appearing with it for the first time and, as a sig- 
nificational expression, clinging to all forms and materials.21.
This doctrine of forms,22 the idea of which we have repeatedly 
touched upon before and which, according to our showings, makes 
up the essentially necessary lower level of a scientific mathesis univer­
salis, loses its isolation because of the results of present investigations; 
it acquires its home within the universal doctrine of forms of senses of 
whatever sort — a doctrine conceived as an idea — and its ultimate 
place of origin in noematic phenomenology.
Let us bring that somewhat closer to us.
Analytic-syntactical operations are, we said,23 possible opera­
tions with respect to all possible sense and posita of whatever 
determination-content which the noematic sense in question24 may 
include “ non-explicatedly” (the noematic sense being actually noth­
ing else than the “ meant” object as “m eant” and with the particular 
How of its determination-content). However, it always admits of 
explication and some operations or other essentially connected with 
explication (“analysis” ) admit of being effected. The synthetical25

forms which thus accrue (in reminiscence of grammatical “syntaxes” 
we also called them the syntactical forms) are wholly determinate, 
belonging to a fixed system of forms; they can be singled out by 
abstraction and comprehended conceptually-explicitly. Thus, for 
example, that which is the perceived as perceived in a perceptual 
position simpliciter can be treated by us analytically in a manner 
which is indicated in the expressions: “This is black, an inkpot, this 
black inkpot is not white, is, if white, then not black,” and the like. 
With each step we have a new sense; instead of the original one- 
membered positum <we have> a synthetical26 positum which, according 
to the law of the expressability of all protodoxic posita, admits of 
being brought to expression or to predicative statement. W ithin the 
membered posita each member has its syntactical form originating 
from the analytic synthesis.
Let us assume that the positings belonging to these sense-forms are 
doxic proto-positings: then different forms of judgments in the logical 
sense [apophantic posita) accrue. The aim of determining a priori all 
these forms, of controlling in systematic completeness the infinitely 
manifold and yet regulatedly delimited form-formations, designates 
for us the idea of a theory of the forms of apophantic posita, respectively 
syntaxes.
<277) 
But positions and, in particular, the synthetical total position can 
also be doxic modalities. We deem likely, perhaps, and explicate that in 
the mode “presumably” intended to; or it stands there as ques­
tionable and, in the questionability-consciousness, we explicate the 
questionable; etc. If we give expression to the noematic correlates of 
these modalities (“S may well b ep ,” “ Is S p?” and the like) and if we 
do the same also for the unmodified predicative judgment itself, as we 
also express affirmation and negation (e.g.: “S is not p.” “Yet S is p,” 
“S is certainly, actually p” ) — then the concept of form and the idea of 
the theory of the forms of posita is consequently amplified. The form is 
now27 manifoldly determined, partly by means of the properly syn­
tactical forms, partly by means of the doxic modalities. Accordingly, 
a total position belonging to the total positum always remains, and a 
doxic position is included in it. At the same time, by means of a sense- 
explication and predication which converts the modal characteristic 
into a predication, each such positum and the conceptual “ex-

pression” suitable to it admits of being converted into a predicative 
proposition, into a judgment which judges about the modality of a 
content of such and such a form (e.g., “it is certain, it is possible, 
probable that S. is p ” ).
As with judgment-modalities, so it is similarly the case with founded 
positions or with senses and posita belonging to the emotional and 
volitional spheres, with the syntheses belonging specifically to them and 
their corresponding modes of expression. The aim of the new theory 
of forms of posita and specifically of synthetical posita is then easily 
indicated.
In this connection, one also sees at the same time that the theory of all 
posita is mirrored in a suitably amplified theory of forms of doxic posita — if, 
in precisely the same way as the being-modalities, we include in the 
judgment-material the modalities of ought to be (providing that the 
analogous locution is allowed). W hat this inclusion means certainly 
does not require a long exposition, but at the most illustration by way 
of examples: Instead of saying “ May S be p,” perhaps <we say>: It 
may be that S be p, it is desirable (not desired); instead of “S ought to 
be p:” It ought to be that S be p, it is something which ought to be.
Phenomenology itself does not see its task in the systematic 
elaboration of the theories of forms in which, as is to be learned from 
the theory of apophantic forms, the systematic possibilities of all <278) 
further formations become deductively derived from primitive 
axiomatically fundamental formations; the field <of phenomenology) 
is the analysis of the Apriori which can be legitimated in immediate 
intuition, the fixing of immediately evident essences and concatenat­
ions of essences and their descriptive cognition in the systematic 
combination of all strata in transcendentally pure consciousness.
W hat the theorizing logician isolates in the formal theory of sig­
nification by virtue of his one-sided direction of interest as something 
dealt with for itself, without heeding and comprehending the noema­
tic and noetic context in which it is phenomenologically interwoven
— that the phenomenologist takes in its full interrelationship. To 
trace out the phenomenological complex of essencesfrom all sides is his 
great task. Every axiomatic legitimation of a fundamental concept in 
logic becomes a heading for phenomenological investigations. W hat 
has already been brought out purely and simply in the broadest 
logical universality as “positum” (judgmental positum), as categor­
ical or hypothetical positum, as attributive determination, nomi- 
nalized adjectivum or relativum, and the like, gives rise to difficult and

far-reaching groups of problems of pure phenomenology in so far as 
<what has been brought out> is set back into the corresponding 
noematic concatenations of essences from which the theorizing 
regard has singled it out <in the first place>.
§135. Object and Consciousness. The Transition to the Phenomenology of 
Reason.
Just as every intentive mental process has a noema and therein a 
sense by which it is related to an object, so, conversely, everything 
which we call object, of which we speak, which we confront as 
actuality which we hold as possible or probable, no m atter how 
indeterminately we think it, is precisely therefore already an object of 
consciousness; and that signifies that whatever world and actuality 
taken universally may be called, they must be represented in the 
framework of actual and possible consciousness by corresponding 
senses or posita filled with more or less intuitive contents. If, as a 
consequence, phenomenology effects “exclusions,55 if <phenome- 
nology> as transcendental parenthesizes all actual positing of realities 
and effects the other parenthesizings which we have described ear­
lier, then we now understand on the basis of a profounder ground the 
sense and rightness of the earlier thesis: that everything excluded 
<279) phenomenologically in a certain change of sign still belongs within 
the boundaries of phenomenology.28 That is to say, the real and ideal 
actualities which undergo exclusion are represented in the pheno­
menological sphere by the total multiplicities of senses and posita 
corresponding to them.
For example, each actual physical thing belonging to Nature is 
thus represented by all the senses and changing fulfilled posita in 
which it is the correlate of possible intentive mental processes as 
determined and further determinable thus and so; <it is> therefore 
represented by the multiplicities of “full cores” or, which signifies the 
same thing here, by all possible “subjective modes of appearance”29 
in which it can be noematically constituted as identical. But this 
constitution is related in the first place to an essentially possible 
individual consciousness, then also to a possible communal con-
28 a u t h o r ’s  f o o t n o t e :  Cf. §76, p- 142.
29 Marginal note in Copy D to modes of appearance: apparencies

sciousness, i.e., to an essentially possible plurality of consciousness- 
Egos and consciousness-streams standing in <mutual> “exchange,” 
for which one physical thing is to be intersubjectively given and 
identified as the same objective actuality. It is always to be noted that 
all our statements, including the present ones, are to be understood in 
the sense of the phenomenological reductions and in eidetic 
universality.
On the other hand, there corresponds to each physical thing, and 
ultimately to the whole world of physical things with one space and 
one time, the multiplicity of possible noetic occurrences, the possible 
mental processes of single individuals and communal individuals 
related to them — mental processes which, as parallels to the previ­
ously considered noematic multiplicities, have in their essence itself 
the peculiarity of relating themselves to this world of physical things 
according to sense and positum. There thus appear in them the 
multiplicities of hyletic Data in question, with the relevant “con- 
struings,” positional act-characteristics, etc., which, in their 
connected unity, make up precisely what we call experimental consci­
ousness of physical thingness. The unity of the physical thing stands 
over against an ideally infinite multiplicity of noetic mental processes 
of a wholly determined essential content and which can be surveyed 
despite the infinity, all of them united by being consciousness of the 
“same thing.” This unification becomes given in the sphere of con­
sciousness itself, in mental processes which, on their side, also belong 
again to the group which we have delimited here.
For the restriction to experiential consciousness was meant only as 
an example, likewise that to the “physical thing” belonging to the <280) 
“world.” Each and everything is eidetically prescribed no matter 
how far we stretch the framework <of inquiry>, no matter on which 
level of universality and particularity we also move — be it even <on 
the level of> the lowest concretions. As the sphere of mental processes 
is rigorously conformable to law according to its transcendental 
essential structure, so that possible essential formation according to 
noesis and noema is firmly determined in it, just as any possible figure 
to be inscribed in space is determined by the essence of space accord­
ing to unconditionally valid laws. W hat is called possibility (eidetic 
existence) in both cases is, therefore, absolutely necessary possibility, 
an absolutely firm member in an absolutely firm framework of an 
eidetic system. <To achieve> scientific cognition is its goal, i.e., to 
theoretically stamp and control it <so that it becomes> a system of

concepts and statements of laws which have their source in the pure 
intuition of essences. All fundamental differentiations, which make 
formal ontology and the theory of categories accruing to it the theory 
of the distribution of regions of being and their categories of being, as 
well as the constitution of material ontologies appropriate to them — 
are, as will be understood in particular details in further steps, 
principal headings for phenomenological investigations. Necessarily 
corresponding to them are the noetic-noematic essential connections 
which must allow of being systematically described and determined 
with respect to possibilities and necessities.
If we examine more precisely what the essential connections be­
tween object and consciousness characterized in the present consid­
eration signify and must signify, we are made to feel an ambiguity, 
and in following it up we notice that we stand at a major turning 
point in our investigations. We assign to an object a multiplicity of 
“posita” and of mental processes of a certain noematic content and, 
more particularly, in such a way that syntheses of identification 
become a priori possible through them by virtue of which the object 
can and must be presented as the same. There is necessarily con­
sciousness of the X as the same in the different acts or act-noemas 
furnished with differing “determination-contents.” But is it actually 
the same? And is the object itself “actual”? Can it not be non-actual while 
the manifoldly harmonious and even intuitionally fulfilled posita — 
posita of any essence-content whatever — still flow off in the way 
peculiar to consciousness?
We are not interested in the factualities of consciousness and its 
processes; rather we are interested instead in the problems of essence 
<281) which might be formulated here. Consciousness, or the conscious- 
ness-subject itself, judges about actuality, asks about it, deems it likely, 
doubts it, resolves the doubt and thereby effects the “legitimations of 
reason.” Must not the essence of this legitimacy and, correlatively, the 
essence of “actuality” — related to all kinds of objects according to 
all formal and regional categories — be allowed to become clear in 
the essential context of transcendental consciousness, thus purely 
phenomenologically?
There was, therefore, an ambiguity in our speaking of the noetic- 
noematic “constitution” of objectivities, e.g., physical thing-objectivi- 
ties. Pre-eminently in every case we thought of “actual” objects, of 
physical things belonging to the “actual world” or at least of “an” 
actual world taken universally. But, then, what does “actual” signify

for objects which, in the manner peculiar to consciousness, are still 
only given through sense and posita? W hat does it signify for these 
posita themselves, for the essential sorts of these noemas and of the 
parallel noeses? W hat does it signify for the particular modes of their 
structure according to form and fullness? How is this structure 
particularized according to the particular object-regions? The quest­
ion is, thus, how, noetically and noematically, in phenomenological 
scientificalncss, all the concatenations of consciousness are to be 
described which make necessary, precisely in its actuality, an object 
simpliciter (which, in the sense of ordinary speech, always signifies an 
actual object). In the broader sense, however, the object is “constitut­
ed” — “whether or not it is actual” — in certain concatenations of 
consciousness which in themselves bear a discernible unity in so far as 
they, by virtue of their essence, carry with themselves the conscious­
ness of an identical X.
As a m atter offact, what has been worked out does not concern just 
actualities in some pregnant sense or other. Questions about actu­
ality enter into all cognitions as cognitions, even in our 
phenomenological cognitions bearing upon the possible constitution 
of objects: they all have, indeed, their correlates in “objects” which 
are meant as “actually existing.” When, it may everywhere be asked, 
is the noematically “intended-to” 
Vermeintes”] identity of X “ac­
tually” the identity <of X> instead of the “merely” intended-to 
<identity>? And what does this “merely intended-to” everywhere 
signify?30
We must, therefore, devote new considerations to the problems of 
actuality and to the correlative ones of rational consciousness which 
in itself legitimates <that actuality>.

In Copy D the noematically... identity of X Changed to: the noematically “intended-to,” the

If one speaks simply of objects, one normally means actual, truly 
existing objects belonging to the particular category of being. No 
matter what one says about such objects, that which is meant and 
stated must — if one speaks rationally — be something which can be 
“grounded,” “shown,” directly “seen” or mediately “seen intellectually.” 
In the logical sphere, in the sphere of statement, “being truly” or 
“actually" and “being something which can be shown rationally” are necessari­
ly correlated. This holds, moreover, for all modalities of being, all doxic 
positional modalities. Obviously the possibility of the rational show­
ing referred to here should be understood, not as empirical, but as 
“ideal,” as an essential possibility.
§136. The First Fundamental Form of Rational Consciousness: Originarily 
Presentive “Seeing ”
If we now ask what rational showing signifies, that is, of what rational 
consciousness consists, the intuitive presentiation of examples and the 
beginnings of eidetic analysis performed on them offers us at once a 
number of differences:
First, the difference between positing mental processes in which 
the posited becomes given originarily and those in which it does not 
become given in that mode: thus, between “perceiving” or “seeing” acts
— in a broadest sense — and non- “perceiving” acts.
Thus a memorial consciousness — for example, of a landscape — is 
not originarily presentive; the landscape is not perceived as it would 
be in case we actually saw it. By this we do not mean to say that 
memorial consciousness has no competence ofits own: only that it is 
not a “seeing” consciousness. Phenomenology brings to light an 
analogue of this contrast in each of the other kinds of positing mental

processes. For example: We can assert “blindly” that two plus one is 
equal to one plus two; but we can also make the same judgment in the 
manner peculiar to intellectual seeing. When we do this, the pre­
dicatively formed affair-complex, the synthetical objectivity corre­
sponding to the judgment-synthesis, is given originarily, seized upon 
in an originary manner. It is no longer given originarily after effecting 
the actual \lebendigen\ intellectual seeing which becomes forthwith an 
obscured retentional modification. Even though this may have a 
rational superiority to just any obscure or confused consciousness <283) 
with the same noematic sense — for example, an “unthinking” 
reproduction of something learned and, perhaps, intellectually seen 
on an earlier occasion — it is not an originarily presentive 
consciousness.
These differences do not concern the pure sense or the pure 
positum, since in both members of any such exemplary pair this is 
identical and also can always be intentively seen as identical. The 
difference concerns the mode in which the bare sense or the bare positum — 
which, as merely an abstract moment in the concrete noema of 
consciousness, requires complementary moments — is or is not a 
fulfilled sense or positum.
A fullness of the sense does not make all the difference; the How of 
the fulfilledness matters as well. One mode of consciousness pertain­
ing to the sense is the “intuitive” mode, which is such that the “meant 
object as m eant” is intentively intuited; and an especially pre­
eminent case here is the one in which the mode of intuition is precisely 
the originarily presentive mode. In the perception of the landscape the 
sense is fulfilled perceptually; in the mode of “itself in person” there is 
consciousness of the perceived object with its colors, forms, and other 
determinations (in so far as they “are included in the perception” ).
Similar pre-eminent cases are found in every act-sphere. Again the 
situation is one which is two-sided in the sense of a parallelism; it is 
noetic and noematic. Focusing on the noema we find, fused with the 
pure sense, the characteristic “in person” (as originary fulfilledness); 
and the sense, with this characteristic, now functions as the basis for the 
noematic posited characteristic or, this being the same thing here: the 
being-characteristic. We find the parallel to this in focusing on the 
noesis.
But the posited characteristic has as its own a specific rational character, as a 
distinguishing mark accruing to it essentially, if and only if it is a position 
on the basis of a fulfilled, originarily presentive sense and not merely 
on the basis ofjust any sense.

Here, and in the case of any other kind of rational consciousness, 
the word “ belong” takes on a peculiar signification. For example:1 
Position belongs to any appearing “in person” on the part of a physical 
thing; it is not just somehow one with the appearing (perhaps even as 
merely a universal fact — this being out of the question here); it is one 
with it in a peculiar manner: it is “motivated” by <the appearing) and 
<284) again, not just somehow, but “rationally motivated.” That is to say, 
position has its original legitimizing basis in originary givenness. With 
other modes of givenness legitimizing bases need not be lacking; 
lacking, however, is the superiority of the original basis which plays its 
pre-eminent role in the relative estimating of other legitimizing 
bases.
In just the same manner, the position of the essence of pre­
dicatively formed essence-complex given “originarily” in the seeing of 
essences “belongs” to the position-“material” <of the essence or pre­
dicatively formed essence-complex>, to the “sense” in its mode of 
givenness. It is rational and as certainty of believing it is an originally 
motivated position; it has the specific character of an “intellectually 
seeing” position. If the position is blind, if the verbal significations are 
effected on the basis of an obscure and confusedly intentive act- 
substratum, then the rational character belonging to intellectual 
seeing is necessarily lacking; that character is essentially incompatible 
with obscure givenness of the predicatively formed affair-complex (if 
the word givenness is still to be used here) or with such a noematic 
outfitting of the sense-core. On the other hand, this does not exclude 
a secondary rational character, as is shown by the example of an 
imperfect re-presentiating of eidetic cognitions.
Intellectual seeing, evidence of any kind, is thus a wholly distin­
guishing occurrence; in terms ofits “core” it is the unity of a rational 
position with that which essentially motivates the position — this whole 
situation being understandable as noetic and also as noematic. The 
word motivation is particularly suited to the relation between the 
(noetic) positing and the noematic positum in its mode of fulfilledness. 
The expression, “evident positum,” is, in its noematic signification, 
immediately understandable.
The double sense of the word evidence, in its application, some­
times to noetic characteristics or to full acts (for example, evidence of
1

as <thc physical thing-sense> appears “in person.” The position as the position of this sense is 
motivated by the appearing “in person.”

judging) and sometimes to noematic posita (for example, evident 
logical judgm ent, evident predicative proposition), is a case of the 
universal and necessary double significances of expression relating 
to moments of the correlation between noesis and noema. 
Phenomenological demonstration of their source makes these double 
significances harmless and, indeed, makes it possible to recognize 
their indispensability.
We should note furthermore that the word fulfillment has another 
double sense which lies in a quite different dimension. Sometimes it 
signifies “fulfillment of the intention,” as a characteristic which the 
actual positum takes on by virtue of the particular mode of the sense; 
sometimes it signifies precisely the peculiarity of this mode itself or <285) 
the peculiarity of the sense in question, as including2 a “filling” which 
motivates rationally.
§137. Evidence and Intellectual Sight. “Originary” and “Pure” Evidence, 
Assertoric and Apodictic Evidence.
The pairs of examples used above illustrate a second and third differ­
ence.3 W hat we usually call evidence and intellectual sight (or intellectual 
seeing) is a positional, doxic and adequately presentive consciousness 
which “excludes being otherwise;” the positing is motivated in a 
quite exceptional manner by the adequate givenness and is, in the 
highest sense, an act of “reason.” The arithmetical example illus­
trates that for us. In the example of the landscape we have, it is true, a 
seeing, but not an evidence in the usual pregnant sense of the word, 
an “intellectual seeing.” Observing more precisely, we note two 
differences. In the one example it is a matter of  essences; in the other, a 
m atter of something individual; secondly, in the eidetic example the 
originary givenness is adequate, whereas in the example from the 
sphere of experience it is inadequate. The two differences, which cross 
one another under some circumstances, will prove to be significant 
with respect to the kind of evidence.4

Highest point of view: immediate evidence: 1) something individual — 2)essence; mediate

With regard to the first difference, it is phenomenologically ob­
servable that, so to speak, the “assertoric” seeing of something individual, 
for example, the “attentive perceiving” of a physical thing or of an 
individual affair-complex, differs essentially in its rational character 
not only from an “apodictic” seeing, from the intellectual seeing of an essence 
or of a predicatively formed essence-complex;5 but it also differs from the 
modification of this intellectual seeing which may come about 
through mixture of the two, namely in the case where something seen 
intellectually is applied to something seen assertorically and in any 
case of knowing the necessity of the being-thus of a posited single 
particular.
Evidence and intellectual seeing, in the usual pregnant sense, are 
understood as signifying the same thing: apodictic intellectual 
seeing. We propose to separate the two in our terminology. We need 
a more universal term which encompasses in its signification both 
assertoric seeing and apodictic intellectual seeing. It should be 
regarded as a phenomenological cognition of the greatest impor­
tance that the two belong to one essential genus and that, compre­
hended more universally, any rational consciousness whatever is a highest 
<286) genus of positional modalities within which the “seeing” (in the 
extremely broadened sense) related to originary givenness is pre­
cisely a rigidly delimited species. Now in order to name the highest 
genus one has the choice between extending either the signification of 
the term “seeing” (as has just been done, but going very much 
further) or that of the terms “intellectual insight” and “evidence.” It 
seems best to choose the term evidence for the most universal concept; 
then, for every rational position characterized by a motivational 
relation to originariness of givenness, the expression originary evidence 
would be available. Furthermore, a distinction should be made 
between assertoric and apodictic evidence; and the term intellectual seeing 
should be used, as before, to designate this apodicticity. Going still 
further, one should contrast pure intellectual seeing and impure in­
tellectual seeing (for example, cognition of the necessity pertaining to 
something factual, the being of which need not itself be evident) and 
likewise, quite universally, jfrwr and impure evidence.

being.

Yet other differences result if one inquires more deeply — dif­
ferences in the motivating foundations which affect the evidence- 
characteristic. For example, the difference between purely formal 
(“analytic,” “logical” ) and material (synthetic a priori) evidence.
Here, however, we must not go beyond the first indications.
§138. Adequate and Inadequate Evidence.
Let us return to the second distinction concerning evidence indicated 
above, with which the distinction between adequate and inadequate 
givenness is connected and which, at the same time, provides us with 
the occasion for describing a distinctive type of “impure” evidence.
The positing of the physical thing on the ground of the appearance 
“itself in person” is, to be sure, a rational positing, but the ap­
pearance is always only a one-sided, “imperfect” appearance; inten­
ded to as “itself in person,” what “properly” appears is not only 
there, but simply this physical thing itself, the whole in conformity 
with the total sense, though only one-sidedly intuited and, moreover, 
multifariously indeterminate. W hat “properly” appears cannot be 
separated from the physical thing as, let us say, a physical thing for 
itself; in the full sense of the physical thing, the sense-correlate <of 
what “properly” appears> fashions a non-self sufficient part which can 
only have unity and selfsufficiency of sense in a whole which necessarily 
includes in itself empty components and indeterminate components.
O f essential necessity something physically real, a being with that 
sense, appears only “inadequately” in a closed appearance. Essentially 
tied up with this is the fact that no rational positing which rests upon <287) 
that sort of inadequately presentive appearance can be “ultimately valid” 
“insurmountable;” and that no <rational positing> is equivalent in its 
singularization to the <positing> simpliciter: “The physical thing is 
actual;” it is only Equivalent to the positing: “it is actual” — assum­
ing that the further course of experience does not bring forth “strong­
er rational motives” which show the original positing as a positing 
to be “cancelled out” in the broader context. Accordingly, the 
positing is only rationally motivated by the appearance (the imper­
fectly fulfilled perceptual sense) in and for itself, considered in its 
singularization.
The phenomenology of reason must therefore study the different 
occurrences which are a priori predelineated in the sphere of the

modes of being which are necessarily only inadequately presentive 
(,transcendencies in the sense of realities). It must make clear how 
consciousness of inadequate givenness, how the one-sided appearing, 
is related to one and the same determinable X in the continuous 
progress to always new appearances which are continually being 
blended with one another; which eidetic possibilities result here; 
how, on the one hand, a continuation of experience is possible and 
always rationally motivated by continually available rational posit­
ings: precisely the course of experience in which the empty places of 
the previous appearance are filled out, the indeterminacies are more 
precisely determined and thus always in the m anner of a thoroughgoing 
harmonious fulfilling with a steadily increasing rational power. On the other 
hand, it must make clear the contrary possibilities, the cases of fusion or 
polythetical syntheses of discordancy, the “determination otherwise” of the X 
always intended to as the same — otherwise than in the correspond­
ingly original sense-bestowal. Moreover, it must show how positional 
components pertaining to the earlier perceptual flow suffer can­
cellation together with their sense; how, under circumstances, the 
whole perception, so to speak, explodes and splits up into “conflicting 
physical thing-apprehensions,” into suppositions concerning physical 
things; how the positings of these suppositions are annulled and 
uniquely modified in this annulment; or else how the one positing, 
remaining unmodified, “conditions” the cancellation of the 
“counter positing;” and similar processes of the same kind.
<288) 
To be studied in still more detail are the relevant modifications 
which the original rational positings undergo such that they incur a 
positive phenomenological increase with respect to their motivating “force” 
in the further course of harmonious fulfillment, such that they con­
tinually acquire a “weight” always and essentially have a weight, to 
be sure, but one which differs by degrees. There are, moreover, the 
other possibilities to be analyzed: how the weight of positings is 
affected by “counter motives,” how, in the case of doubt, they are 
mutually “held in balance,” how a positing in competition with one of 
“greater” weight is “overcome” “abandoned” etc.
In addition, naturally, it is necessary to subject to a comprehensive 
eidetic analysis the processes in the sense, as the appertinentposition- 
materials, which are essentially determinative for alterations in the 
posited characteristics (e.g., the processes of “conflict” or “ rivalry” 
of appearances). For here, as everywhere, in the phenomenological 
sphere there are neither accidents nor facticities: everything is mot­
ivated by essential determination.

In the same m anner an inquiry into the essence of all kinds of immediate 
rational acts is to be carried out in the context of a universal phenom­
enology of noetic and noematic data.
To every region and category of alleged objects there corresponds 
phenomenologically not only afundamental sort of sensey or ofposita, but 
also a fundamental type of originarily presentive consciousness of such senses 
and, belonging to it, a fundamental type of originary evidence which is 
essentially motivated by originary givenness of such a character.
Every such evidence — understanding the term in our broadened 
sense — is either adequate evidence, of essential necessity incapable of 
being further “strengthened” or “ weakened,” thus without degrees of 
weight; or the evidence is inadequate and thus capable of being increased 
and decreased. W hether or not this or that evidence is possible in a 
given sphere depends on its generic type. It is therefore a priori 
prefigured, and it is countersense to demand in one sphere the 
perfection belonging to the evidence of another sphere (e.g. that of 
eidetic relationships) which essentially excludes it.
It must still be noted that the original signification of the concepts 
of “adequate” and “inadequate” related to modes of givenness had <289) 
to be extended to the essential peculiarities pertaining to the rational 
positings themselves which are founded by them precisely by virtue 
of this nexus — one of those unavoidable equivocations by extension 
<and> which is harmless as long as one recognizes it as such by being 
fully aware of the distinction between the original and the derived.
139. The Interweaving of All Kinds of Reason. Theoretical. Axiological and 
Practical Truth.
According to what has been explained so far, a positing of no m atter 
what quality has-k-s legitimacy as a positing of its sense when it is 
rational; the rational characteristic is precisely itself the character­
istic of legitimation which “befits” it essentially and, therefore, not as 
an accidental fact among accidental circumstances pertaining to a 
factually positing Ego. Correlatively, the positum is also said to be 
legitimated: it is present in rational consciousness, furnished with its 
noematic legitimacy-characteristic which, again, essentially belongs 
to the positum as the noematic position qualified in this or that way, 
and of this or that sense-material. More precisely stated: there 
belongs to it a fullness of such a character which, on its side, grounds 
the rational distinctiveness of the position.

Here the positum has its legitimacy in itself. But it can also be that 
“something speaks on behalf of the positum,” that it can still have a share in 
reason without “itself’ being rational. In order to remain within the 
doxic sphere, let us recall the relevant connection of the doxic 
modalities with the protodoxa6 to which everything refers back. If, 
on the other hand, we consider the rational characteristics belonging 
to these modalities, then at the outset the thought thrusts itself to the 
fore that all of them, no matter how different they may otherwise be 
with respect to materials and motivational foundations, refer back, 
so to speak, to a primal rational character belonging to the domain of 
primal belief, back to the case of originary and ultimately perfect 
evidence. It is noteworthy that profound concatenations of essences 
obtain between these two kinds of retroreference.
Just to indicate the following: in itself, something deemed likely 
can be characterized as rational. If we follow the reference, inherent 
in it, back to the corresponding primal believing, and if we adopt this 
believing in the form of a “supposing,” then “something speaks for 
it.” It is not the belief itself, simpliciter, which is characterized as 
rational, although it has a share in reason. We see that further 
<290) rational-theoretical distinctions and inquiries related to them are 
needed here. Concatenations of essences are made prominent be­
tween the different qualities with the rational characteristics peculiar 
to them and, more particularly, reciprocal concatenations; and,finally, 
all lines run back to primal believings and their primal reason; that is to say, 
to primal truth, or to “truth” <in an absolute sense>.7
Truth is manifestly the correlate of the perfect rational character­
istics pertaining to protodoxa, to certainty of belief. The expression, 
“something posited protodoxically, for instance a predicative pro­
position, is true,” and then the expression, “perfect rational 
characteristics accrue to the corresponding8 believing, judging” — 
are equivalent correlates. Naturally nothing is said about the fact of a 
mental process and about the one whojudges, although it is eidetical-
6 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  C f §104. p .  215.
7 In Copy B the last part of sentence changed to read: All doxic truth ultimately leads back to the idea 
of absolute ( — adequate) truth, to perfect truth. This truth is the correlate. In Copy C the last part 
of sentence changed to read: all truth ultimately leads back to the idea of primal truth.
8 Marginal note in Copy B to “corresponding:” Corresponding believing! = There is an absolute 
(an adequate) evidence. Adequate truth is not as good an expression: absolute truth. Still one 
can also accept it and say: adequation consists of the fact that truth is directed toward the 
existing piedicatively formed affair-complcx. The “there is” [‘Vj gibt"\ = the mathematical 
“there is.”

ly unquestionable that truth can only be actually given in an actual 
evidential consciousness; and this holds for the truth of the unques­
tionableness itself, the truth of the equivalence just indicated, and so 
forth. If the protodoxic evidence, that of certainty of belief, is lacking 
to us, then for its sense-content, “S is p,” we say, a doxic modality can 
be evident — for example, the presumed likelihood, “S ought to be 
p.” This modal evidence is manifestly equivalent to and necessarily 
connected with a protodoxic evidence of an altered sense, i.e., with 
the evidence or with the primal truth: “That S is p is likely 
(probable);” on the other hand, <the modal evidence is also connect- 
ed> with the truth: “Something speaks for S being p;” and, again: 
“Something speaks for Sp being true;” and so forth. With all this 
eidetic connections are indicated which require phenomenological 
inquiries into their origin.
But evidence is by no means a mere name for those sorts of rational 
processes in the sphere of belief (and even less in the sphere of the 
predicative judgment); it is rather a name for all positional spheres and, 
in particular, also for the significant rational relationships obtaining 
between them.
It therefore involves the highly difficult and far-reaching groups of 
problems of reason in the sphere of emotional and volitional posit­
ings9 as well as their interwovenness with the “theoretical,” i.e., 
doxic, reason. The “theoretical” or “doxological truth” or evidence, has 
its parallel in the “axiological and practical truths or evidence” whereby 
the latter “truths” are given expression and cognized in doxological <291) 
truths, that is to say, in specifically logical (apophantical) ones.10 It 
need not be said that to deal with these problems there must be 
fundamental investigations of the sort which we tried to embark 
upon above: investigations involving the eidetic relationships which 
connect the doxic positings with all other kinds of positings, those of 
the emotions and the will and, again, those which lead all doxic 
modalities back to the protodoxa. Precisely by such investigations it 
is made understandable on the basis of ultimate grounds why the 
certainty of belief and, correspondingly, the doxological and ul-
9 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  A first impulse in this direction was given by Brentano’s brilliant 
work, Vom Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis (Leipzig, 1889) [The Origin of Our Knowledge of Right and 
Wrong, translated by Roderick M. Chisholm and Elizabeth H. Schneewind (New York, 1969)] 
a work to which I feel gratefully indebted.
10 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  Cognition is, above all, a name for logical truth: designated from the 
standpoint of the subject, as the correlate of his evidential judging; but it is also a name for every 
sort of evidential judging itself and, finally, for every doxically rational act.

timately the primal truth play such a dominant role in all of reason — 
a role which, at the same time, also makes it obvious that, with 
respect to their solution, the problems of reason in the doxic sphere 
must take precedence over those of axiological and practical reason.
§140. Confirmation. Justification Without Evidence. Equivalence of Positional 
and Neutral Intellectual Sight.
Further studies are required concerning the problems presented to us 
by combinations of “coincidence” which (to mention but one distinctive 
case), in accord with their essence, are to be established between acts of 
the same sense and positum, but of different rational values. For example, an 
evidential act and a non-evidential act can coincide, as a con­
sequence of which, in the transition from the latter to the former, the 
former acquires the characteristic of a validating act, whereas the 
latter, <the non-evidential act,> acquires the characteristic of an act 
which is being validated. The positing with intellectual seeing of the 
one functions as “confirmatory5’ for the positing without intellectual 
seeing of the other. The “positum” is “verified” or even “con­
firmed,” the imperfect modes of givenness are converted into perfect 
ones. How the process looks, and can look, is predelineated by the 
essence of the kinds of positing in question, or else by the essence of the 
posita in the particular case in their fulfillment. For every genus of 
posita the forms of essentially possible verification must be made 
clear phenomenologically.
If the positing is not non-rational, then motivated possibilities are 
to be drawn from its essence showing that and how the positing can 
become converted into an actual rational positing which verifies it. It 
is to be intellectually seen, in this connection, that not every imper­
fect evidence prescribes a course of fulfillment which terminates in a 
<292) corresponding originary evidence, in an evidence of the same sense; on 
the contrary, such an originary verification, so to speak, is necessarily 
excluded by certain sorts of evidence. T hat holds, e.g., for retro­
spective memory and, in a certain way, for any remembering what­
ever, and likewise essentially for empathy to which we shall assign, in 
the <Second> Book, a fundamental kind of evidence (and which we 
shall investigate there in greater detail). In any case, we have 
designated very important phenomenological themes.
Yet to be observed is that the motivated possibility, of which we

spoke above, is to be sharply distinguished from empty possibility:11 
it is motivationally determined by that which the positum includes in 
itself, given such as it is fulfilled. It is an empty possibility that the 
now unseen underside of this desk here has ten legs instead of four, 
which is actually the case. In contrast, the number four is a motivated 
possibility for the determinate perception which I am in the process 
of effecting. For any perception whatever it is a motivated possibility 
that, in certain ways, perceptual “circumstances” can change, that 
“as a consequence” in corresponding modes the perception can 
change into a series of perceptions of determinate kinds prede­
lineated by the sense of my perception and which fulfills it and 
confirms its positing.
For the rest, with respect to “empty” or “mere” possibility of 
validation two further cases are to be distinguished: Either the 
possibility coincides with actuality, that is to say, such that the intellectual 
seeing of the possibility eo ipso carries with it consciousness of originary 
givenness and consciousness of reason; or, however, that is not the 
case. The latter obtains in the example just used. Actual experience, and 
not merely a running through in presentiation of “possible” per­
ceptions, provides an actual validation of positings bearing upon something 
real, let us say, validation of the positing of the factual existence of 
events belonging to Nature. In contrast, in any case of a positing of an <293) 
essence, or else of a positum pertaining to an essence, the intuitive 
presentiation of its perfect fulfillment is equivalent to the fulfillment itself, just 
as a priori the intuitive presentiation, indeed the mere phantasy, of 
an eidetic concatenation is “equivalent” to the intellectual seeing of 
that concatenation, i.e., the one changes into the other by means of a 
mere alteration of attitude; and the possibility of this reciprocal 
conversion is an essentially necessary, rather than accidental, one.
11 
a u t h o r ’s  f o o t n o t e :  This is one of the most essential equivocations of the term “possi­
bility,” to which others (the formal-logical possibility,the mathematical-formal non­
contradiction) are added. It is of fundamental importance that the possibility, which plays its 
role in the theory of probabilities, and that accordingly the consciousness of possibility (the 
being deemed possible), of which we spoke in the theory of doxic modalities as being parallel to 
the consciousness which deems likely, has motivated possibilities as correlates. A probability is 
never built out of unmotivated possibilities; only motivated possibilities have “weight,” etc.

§141. Immediate and Mediate Rational Positing. Mediate Evidence.
As we know, all mediate grounding leads back to immediate 
grounding. With respect to all object-provinces and positings related 
to them, the primal source oj all legitimacy lies in immediate evidence 
and, more narrowly delimited, in originary evidence, or in the originary 
givenness motivating it. But in different ways one can indirectly 
draw upon this source, deriving from it the rational value of a 
positing which, in itself, is not an evidence, or if the positing is 
immediate, confirming and corroborating it.
Let us consider the last case. In an example let us indicate the 
difficult problems which are involved in the relationship of non- 
evidential, immediate rational positing to originary evidence (in our sense 
related to the originarity of givenness).
In a certain mode, any clear memory has original, immediate legit­
imacy: considered in and for itself, it “weighs” something, no matter 
how much or how little; it has a “weight.” But it only has a relative 
and imperfect legitimacy. With respect to what memory present- 
iates, a past event, let us say, there is inherent in it a relationship to 
the actual present. It posits the past event and along with it necessari­
ly posits a horizon, even though in a vague, dark and indeterminate 
way; made clear and positionally distinct, it must allow of being made 
explicit in a complex of positionally effected memories which would 
terminate in actual perceptions, in the actual hie et nunc. This holds for 
memories of whatever sort in our broadest sense related to all temporal 
modes.
In such posita, intellectual seeings of essences are unmistakably 
enounced. They point to interconnections of essences with the val- 
<294) idation of which the sense and the kind of verification, of which each 
memory is capable and “in need,” would be clarified. With every 
advance from memory to memory into the concatenation of mem­
ories being made distinct, memory is confirmed. To a certain extent 
the confirmation is a reciprocal one, the weights of the memories are 
functionally dependent on one another; each memory in the con­
catenation12 has a growing force with the amplification of the con­
catenation — a force greater than they would have in a narrower 
concatenation or in isolation. If, however, the explication is carried
12 
In Copy A this clause changed to read: in the concatenation of memories which has become 
intuitive

out to the actual now, then something of the light ofperception and its evidence 
shines back upon the whole series.
One can even say: in hiddenness the rationality, the characteristic of 
legitimacy, of memory springs from the power of perception, effective 
throughout all confusion and darkness even if the perception is “not 
in effect.”
In any case, however, it needs such verification so that what pro­
perly bears the mediate reflection of perceptual legitimacy may 
clearly emerge. Memory has its own kind of inadequacy in that what is 
not remembered can be confused with what is “actually” remem­
bered, or in that different memories transpire and can pass for the 
unity of one memory; whereas in the unfolding of its horizon being 
actualized, the relevant series of memories are separated and in such 
a way that the unitary memory-image “explodes,” becoming disper­
sed into a plurality of mutually incompatible memorial intuitions: as 
a result, there would be processes to describe similar to those which 
we had occasion to indicate for perception (manifestly in a way very 
much more capable of universalization).13
All of this serves as an indication by example of great and import­
ant groups of problems pertaining to “confirmation” andcc verification” of 
immediate rational positings (as well as to illustrate the division of 
rational positings into pure and impure, unmixed and mixed 
positings); but, above all, here we seize upon one sense in which it is 
valid to say that all mediate rational positing and, in further con­
sequence, all predicative and conceptual rational cognizing, leads 
back to evidence. Properly understood, only originary evidence is the <295) 
source of legitimation “originaliter” and, e.g., the rational positing 
pertaining to memory and thus to all reproductive acts, even includ­
ing empathy, is not original and is, in a certain manner, “derived.”
However, there are quite different forms to be drawn from the 
source of originary givenness.
One such form has already been indicated on occasion: the 
weakening of rational values in the continual transition from living 
evidence to non-evidence. But now an essentially different group of 
cases may be referred to, where a positum is mediately related to 
immediately evident grounds in a synthetical complex which is evident 
at every step. As a consequence, there arises a new universal type of 
rational positings phenomenologically different in rational charac-

teristics from immediate evidence. We therefore also have here a kind 
of derived, “mediate evidence” — the kind usually aimed at exclusively 
by the expression, <“mediate evidence.”) In accord with its essence, 
this derived characteristic of evidence can only appear in the final 
member of a concatenation of positings which begins with immediate 
evidences, goes on in differing forms and in all further steps is borne 
by evidences; whereby these evidences are in part immediate, in part 
already derived; in part intellectually seen, in part not, originary or 
non-originary. As a result, a new field of the phenomenological 
theory of reason is designated. The task here is to study in noetic and 
noematic respect the generical as well as the specific eidetic processes 
pertaining to reason in mediate groundings, validatings of every kind and 
form and in all positional spheres; to trace back to their phenomen­
ological origins the different “principles” of such validating which, 
e.g., are of essentially different kinds depending in each case on 
whether or not it is a matter of objectivities given as immanental or 
transcendent, adequate or inadequate; and, on this basis, in retro­
spect of all the phenomenological strata involved, to make these 
“principles” intelligible.
§ 142. Rational Positing and Being.
Along with the universal awareness of reason, which is the aim of the 
groups of investigations indicated — reason in the widest sense 
extended to all species of positings as well as to the axiological and 
practical positings — there must be acquired eo ipso the universal 
clarification of the eidetic correlations combining the idea of true being 
<296) with the ideas: Truth, Reason, Consciousness.
Accordingly, a generical intellectual sight is soon yielded, namely 
that not merely “truly existing object” and “object to be rationally 
posited” are equivalent correlates, but also that “truly existing 
object” and object to be posited in an originally perfect rational 
positing are equivalent. The object would not be given to the rational 
positing imperfectly, merely “one sidedly.” The sense underlying it 
as material for the determinable X would not leave anything “open” 
with respect to any apprehensionally predesignated sides: no deter­
minableness which would not be established determinateness, no 
sense which would not be fully determined, delimited. Since the 
rational positing should be a positing originaliter, it must have its

rational ground in the originary givenness in the full sense of what is 
determined: The X is not only meant in full determinedness, but is 
given originarily precisely in this determinedness. The equivalence 
indicated now signifies:
O f essential necessity (in the Apriori of unconditioned eidetic 
universality), to every “truly existing99 object there corresponds the idea of 
a possible consciousness in which the object itself is seized upon originarily 
and therefore in a perfectly adequate way. Conversely, if this possibility 
is guaranteed, then eo ipso the object truly exists.
Particularly significant here is the following: In the essence of 
every apprehensional category (which is the correlate of every object- 
category) there is determinately predesignated which formations of 
concrete, perfect or imperfect, apprehensions of objects pertaining to 
such categories are possible. Moreover, it is essentially predesignated 
for each imperfect apprehension how it is to be perfected, how its 
sense is to be completed, fulfilled by intuition, and how the intuition 
is to be further enriched.
Every object-category (or every region and every category in our 
narrower, pregnant sense) is a universal essence which of necessity is 
itself made adequately given. In its adequate givenness it /^scribes an 
intellectually seen generical rule for every particular object becoming 
intended to in multiplicities of concrete mental processes (which 
mental processes here, naturally, are to be taken not as individual 
singularities but instead as essences, as ultimate concreta). It pre­
scribes the rule for how an object subordinate to it would be fully 
determined with respect to sense and mode of givenness, how it 
would be made adequately given in an originary way; it prescribes <297) 
by which broken or continually unbroken concatenations of consci­
ousness <the object is given> and which concrete essences are fur­
nished the concatenations. How much is inherent in these brief 
statements will become comprehensible in the more detailed exposit­
ions in the last chapter (from §149 on).
Here a brief indicative example will be sufficient: We know in 
apodictic evidence that the unseen determinations ofa physical thing 
are, like any physical thing-determinations whatever, necessarily 
spatial: this yields a law-conforming rule for the possible modes of 
spatial completion of the unseen sides of the appearing physical 
thing; a rule which, fully developed, is called pure geometry. 
Furthermore, physical thing-determinations are temporal and 
material ones: there belong to them new rules for possible (thus not

arbitrary) sense-completions and, in further consequence, for possi­
ble positional intuitions, or appearances. O f which essential contents 
these can be, under which norms their stuff, their possible noematic 
(and noetic) apprehensional characteristics, stand, that too is a priori 
predesignated.
§143. Adequate Physical Thing-Givenness as Idea in the Kantian Sense.
But before beginning with those problems, an addition is required to 
set aside the illusion of a contradiction with our earlier presentation 
(p. 286). O f essential necessity there are only given, we said, inade­
quately appearing (thus also only inadequately perceivable) objects. 
However, we must not overlook the restrictive addendum which we 
made. We said: inadequately perceivable in a closed appearance. There 
are objects — and included here are all transcendent objects, all 
“realities” comprised by the name Nature or World — which cannot 
be given in complete determinedness and, likewise, in complete 
intuitiveness in a closed consciousness.
But perfect givenness is nevertheless predesignated as “Idea” (in the 
Kantian sense) — as a system which, in its eidetic type, is an 
absolutely determined system of endless processes of continuous 
appearings, or as a field of these processes, an a priori determined 
continuum of appearances with different, but determined, dimensions, 
and governed throughout by a fixed set of eidetic laws.
This continuum is determined more precisely as infinite14on all 
sides, consisting of appearances in all its phases of the same deter- 
<298) minable X so ordered in its concatenations and so determined with 
respect to the essential contents that any of its lines yields, in its 
continuous course, a harmonious concatenation (which itself is to be 
designated as a unity of mobile appearances) in which the X, given 
always as one and the same, is more precisely and never “otherwise” 
continuously-harmoniously determined.
If, now, a closed unity of the course, thus an act only finitely 
mobile, is inconceivable by virtue of the all-sided infinity of the 
continuum (that would yield a countersensical finite infinity): the 
idea of this continuum and the idea of perfect givenness prefigured by 
the idea of the continuum is then nevertheless presented in intellectual

seeing 
seen intellectually just as precisely as an “idea” can be 
intellectually seen by its essence designating its own peculiar type of 
intellectual seeing.
The idea of an infinity motivated in conformity with its essence is 
not itself an infinity; seeing intellectually that this infinity of necessity 
cannot be given does not exclude, but rather requires, the intellectu­
ally seen givenness of the idea of this infinity.
§144. Actuality and Originary Presentive Consciousness: Concluding 
Determinations.
It therefore remains as a result that the Eidos, True-Being, is corre­
latively equivalent to the Eidos, Adequately-Given and To-Be- 
Evidentially Positable — but that either in the sense of finite given­
ness or givenness in the form of an idea. In the one case, being is 
“immanental” being, being as closed mental process or noetic 
mental process-correlate; in the other case, being is transcendent 
being, i.e, being, the “ transcendence” of which inheres precisely in 
the infinity of the noematic correlate which it requires as the 
“material” of being.
When a presentive intuition is adequate and immanental, then, to be 
sure, it is not sense and object which coalesce but, instead, originarily 
fulfilled sense and object. The object is precisely that which is seized 
upon, posited, as the originary It Itselfin adequate intuition; it is seen 
intellectually by virtue of originarity, and by virtue of the sense- 
completedness and completed originary sense-fulfilledness it is ab­
solutely seen intellectually.
When the presentive intuition is one of something transcendent to it, 
then something objective cannot become adequately given; only the 
idea of that something objective can be given, or else ofits sense and its 
“epistemic essence,” and consequently there can be given an a priori 
rule for law-conforming infinities of inadequate experiences.
How the further course of experiences must proceed certainly <299) 
cannot be unambiguously determined on the ground of currently 
effected experiences and of this rule (or of the multiple rule-sytems 
which it includes). To the contrary, infinitely many possibilities 
remain open, but which are prefigured with respect to their type by 
the a priori governing rules so very rich in content. The rule-systems 
of geometry determine with absolute precision all possible forms of

movement which can supplement the observed piece of movement 
here and now, but it does not distinguish a single actual course of 
movement of what is actually moving. How can empirical thinking, 
grounded in experience, be of further help there? How is it possible 
scientifically to determine physical affairs as unities posited accord­
ing to experience, yet which include infinitely many significations? 
How, within the positing of Nature, can the goal of univocal deter­
mination be reached — determination in conformity with the idea of 
the Object belonging to Nature, of the Event belonging to Nature, 
and so forth (which is fully determined as the idea of something 
individually unique)? All these questions pertain to a new level of 
research. They belong to the phenomenology of specifically 
experiencing reason and, in particular, to the phenomenology of 
reason peculiar to physics, psychology and the natural sciences as 
such, which traces back to their phenomenological sources the ont­
ological and noetic rules belonging to experiential science. But this 
signifies that it searches out and eidetically explores the phenomen­
ological strata, noetic and noematic, in which the content of these 
rules are embedded.
§ 145. Critical Considerations Concerning the Phenomenology of Evidence.
It is clear from considerations carried out that the phenomenology of 
reason, noetics in a pregnant sense, which will undertake an intuitive 
exploration not just of any consciousness, but of consciousness of 
reason, everywhere presupposes universal phenomenology. It is itself 
a phenomenological fact that — in the realm of positionality15 — 
positing consciousness is ruled by norms in every genus; the norms are 
nothing else than eidetic laws which, with respect to their kind and 
<300) form, are related to noetic-noematic concatenations to be strictly 
analyzed and described. In that connection, even “non-reason99 is 
naturally everywhere to be regarded as the negative counterpart of

part, absurdity,16 The universal eidetic theory of evidence with its analyses

evidential; and so forth.

related to the most universal eidetic distinctions fashions a relatively 
small, though fundamental, piece of the phenomenology of reason. 
Accordingly, what was briefly maintained at the beginning of this 
Book17 against the inverted interpretation of evidence is confirmed
— and the deliberations just carried out are sufficient to see that 
perfectly.
Evidence is, in fact, not some sort of consciousness-index attached 
to a judgment (and usually one18 speaks of such evidence only in the 
case of judgment), calling to us like a mystic voice from a better 
world: Here is the truth; — as though such a voice would have 
something to say to free spirits like us and would not have to show its 
title to legitimacy. We no longer need to argue with skepticism, nor 
take into consideration objections of the old type which cannot 
overcome the theory of evidence which resorts to indices and feeling: 
whether an evil genius (the Cartesian fiction) or a fateful change in 
the factual course of the world could make it happen that just any 
false judgm ent would be outfitted with this index, this feeling of 
intellectual necessity, of the transcendent oughtness; and the like. If 
one proceeds to the study of the phenomena themselves which belong 
here, and does so within the limits of the phenomenological re­
duction, then one recognizes with fullest clarity that here it is a 
m atter of a relevant mode of positing (thus not of anything so 
insignificant as some sort of attached content, nor of an appendage of 
whatever sort) which belongs to the eidetically determined con­
stitutions of the essence of the noema (e.g., the mode of original 
intellectual seenness belonging to the noematic composition of 
“originarily” presentive seeing of essences). One then further re­
cognizes that once more the eidetic laws rule the relationship of those 
positing acts which do not have this distinctive constitution to those 
which do; that, 
there is something like consciousness of the
“fulfillment of the intention” of justification and confirmation specifi­
cally related to posited characteristics, just as there are the corre- <301) 
sponding counter characteristics of unjustification, disconjirmation. One fur­
ther recognizes that the logical principles require a profound pheno-

phenomenological studies for dealing with the problems of reason in the present chapter.

menological clarification, and that, e.g., the principle of contra­
diction leads us back to concatenations of essences of possible veri­
fication and possible disconfirmation (or rational cancellation).19 
Universally, one acquires the intellectual insight that, above all, it is 
a question here, not of accidental facts, but instead of eidetic pro­
cesses which stand in their eidetic context, and that, therefore, what 
takes place in the Eidos functions as an absolutely insurmountable 
norm for the fact. In this phenomenological chapter one should also 
make clear that not every positing mental process (e.g., any mental 
judgment-process you please) cannot become evident in the same 
manner and, specifically, that not every positing mental process can 
become immediately evidential; furthermore, that all manners of 
rational positing, all types of immediate or mediate evidence, are 
rooted in phenomenological complexes in which the fundamentally 
different regions of objects are noetically-noematically distributed.
In particular, it is of concern to study systematically the con­
tinuous unions of identity and the synthetical identifications in every 
domain with respect to their phenomenological constitution. Once 
one has become acquainted — which is the first step needed — with 
the inner structure of intentive mental processes with respect to all 
universal structures, the parallelism of these structures, the stratifi­
cation in the noema such as sense, subject of sense, posited character­
istics, fullness: then it is necessary to make fully clear in all cases of 
synthetical unions how not just any act-combinations whatever take 
place, but rather how combination into the unity of one act takes 
place. More particularly, how identifying unions are possible, how 
here and there the determinable X is made to coincide, how, in that 
<302) case, sense-determinations and their empty places — here that 
signifies their moments of indeterminateness — are related; likewise, 
how fullnesses, how, therefore, the forms of confirmation, of val-

edition, II, 2, pp. 11 Iff.; English translation, pp. 756fT.]. It is to be regretted that W. Wundt 
judges otherwise here, as he does about phenomenology as a whole. The scientific inquiry, 
which does not in the slightest go beyond the sphere of purely intuitional data, he interprets as 
“Scholasticism.” He designates as a ‘chosen formal schema” the distinction between sense- 
bestowing and sense-fulfilling acts (Kleine Schriften [Shorter Writings], I. <Leipzig,> 1910/11, p. 
613), and the results of our analyses, he says, are the “most primitive” “verbal repetitions:” 
“Evidence is evidence, abstraction is abstraction.” He introduces the conclusion of his critique 
with words which I may be permitted to quote: “Husserl’s foundation of a new logic, directed 
more theoretically than practically, ends in each of its conceptual analyses, in so far as they 
possess a positive content, with the assurance that A actually = A, and that it cannot be 
otherwise” {ibid., pp. 613-614).

idation, of progressive cognition, at lower and higher levels of consci­
ousness, become clear and are intellectually seen in analysis.
However, these and all parallel studies of reason are carried out in 
the “ transcendental,” in the phenomenological attitude. No judg­
ment which occurs there is a natural judgment presupposing the 
positing of natural actuality as background, and not even where the 
phenomenology of the consciousness of actuality, of cognition of 
Nature, of seeing of values related to Nature and intellectual seeing of 
values is concerned. Everywhere we investigate the fashionings of 
noeses and noemata, we project a systematic and eidetic morph­
ology, everywhere bring into relief essential necessities and essential 
possibilities: the latter as necessary possibilities, forms of unions of 
compatibility which are prescribed in the essences and delimited by 
laws of essences. Everywhere “object” is the name for eidetic con­
catenations of consciousness; it appears first of all as noematic X, as 
the subject of sense pertaining to different essential types of sense and 
posita. Moreover, it appears as the name, “actual object,” and is 
then the name for certain eidetically considered rational concatenat­
ions in which the sense-conforming, unitary X inherent in them 
receives its rational position.
Similar names for determined, eidetically delimited groups of 
consciousness-formations “teleologically” belonging together, to be 
fixed by the inquiry into essences, are the expressions, “possible 
object,” “probable,” “dubitable” object; and so forth. The con­
catenations there are always again other, to be described strictly in 
their otherness: thus, e.g., it is easily seen intellectually that the 
possibility of an X determined thus and so20 is not justified simply by 
originary givenness of this X in its sense-composition, thus by auth­
entication of actuality, but rather that even merely reproductively 
founded deeming^possible can be reciprocally confirmed in the 
harmonious coming together; similarly, that doubtfulness is justified in 
conflicting phenomena between modalized intuitions of certain de­
scriptive sorts; and so forth. As a result, the investigations of the 
theory of reason are combined which relate to the distinction of 
materially determinate affairs, values, practical objectivities, and 
which then investigate the formations produced by consciousness 
constitutive for them. Phenomenology therefore actually encom­
passes the whole natural world and all of the ideal worlds which it <303)

excludes: phenomenology encompasses them as the “world sense” by 
virtue of the sets of eidetic laws connecting any object-sense and 
noema whatever with the closed system of noeses, and specifically by 
virtue of the eidetic concatenations of rational positing the correlate 
of which is the “actual object” which, thus, on its side, always 
exhibits the index for the whole determined system of teleologically 
unifying fashionings of consciousness.

TH E  PR O BLEM S O F T H E  T H E O R Y  OF REASON
Previously our meditations on the problems of a phenomenology of 
reason have moved on the heights of universality which did not bring 
about the essential ramifications of the problems and their con­
nections with formal and regional ontologies. In this respect we must 
attempt to be more precise; only in that way will the full sense of the 
phenomenological eidetics of reason and the whole realm of their 
problems be disclosed to us.
§146. The Most Universal Problems.
Let us return to the sources of the problems of reason and follow them 
in their ramifications in the most systematic way possible.
Intentionality is the name of the problem encompassed by the 
whole of phenomenology. The name precisely expresses the funda­
mental property of consciousness; all phenomenological problems, 
even the hyletic ones, find a place within it. As a consequence, 
phenomenology begins with problems of intentionality; but first of 
all <it begins> in universality and without drawing into its sphere 
questions about ac^trat (true) being intended to in consciousness. We 
leave out of consideration the fact that positing consciousness with a 
posited characteristic can be designated in the most universal sense as 
a "meaning” [vermeinen\, and as "meaning” it necessarily comes 
under the rational opposition of validity and invalidity. We only 
arrived at these problems in the last chapters in retrospect of the chief 
structures of consciousness which, in the meantime, have become 
understandable. Because it was a m atter of eidetic beginnings, we 
accordingly carried out the analyses in the greatest possible univer­
sality. The systematic way goes from higher to lower universality in all 
eidetic spheres, even if the analyses tracing them out are attached to

<304) something particular. We spoke of reason and the positing of reason 
taken universally, of originary and derived, of adequate and inade­
quate evidence, of intellectually seeing essences and evidence of 
something; and the like. The descriptions we sketched already pre­
suppose a broad phenomenological basis, a whole series of difficult 
distinctions which we worked out in the chapters on the most univer­
sal structures of consciousness. W ithout the concepts of sense, 
positum, fulfilled positum (epistemic essence in the language of the 
Logische Untersuchungen) we do not arrive at all at the radical formulat­
ion of any problems of the theory of reason. These concepts pre­
suppose, again, other eidetic differentiations corresponding to them: 
the differences of positionality and neutrality, those of posited char­
acteristics and their materials, the exclusion of the relevant eidetic 
modifications which do not enter into the Eidos “positum,” such as, 
e.g., attentional modifications; and so forth. At the same time, in 
order not to underestimate the range of necessary analyses in the 
most universal stratum of the theory of reason, of which we speak 
here, we emphasize that the eidetic descriptions of the last chapters 
should be accepted as simple beginnings. Just as everywhere else, so 
here we only follow through on the methodic aim of preparing so 
much solid ground for each essentially new stratum which should be 
sketched as a field of phenomenological investigations, such that we 
can assure ourselves of it, formulate the problems of departure and 
ground related to it, and freely cast our regard around in the horizon 
of problems surrounding it.
§147. Ramifications of the Problem. Formal Logic, Axiology and Theory of 
Practice.
The universal phenomenology of reason is ramified when we take 
into account the further structural differences which are deter­
minative for rational characteristics: when we take account of the 
differentiations with respect to fundamental kinds of positings, of the 
difference between positing simpliciter and founded positing, and of 
the intersecting differences of one membered positings and synthesiz- 
ings. The chief problem-groups of reason (problems of evidence) are 
related to the chief genera of positings and the position-materials 
essentially required by them. Standing in first place are, naturally, 
proto doxa, the doxic modalities with the modalities of being corre­
sponding to them.

In pursuing such goals of the theory of reason one necessarily gains 
the rational-theoretical problems of clarifying formal logic and the parallel <305) 
disciplines which I have called formal axiology and theory of practice.
It is necessary, first of all, to refer to the earlier expositions1 
concerning the theories of the pure forms of posita and, specifically, of 
synthetical posita related to the predicative doxic synthesis as well as to 
synthetical forms belonging to the doxic modalities, moreover to 
emotional and conative acts. (Thus, e.g., the forms of preference, of 
valuing and willing “for the sake of another,” the forms of the 
axiological “and” and the “or” .) In these theories of form we speak 
noematically of synthetical posita with respect to their pure form 
without raising the question of the validity or non-validity of reason. 
Therefore they still do not belong to the stratum of the theory of 
reason.
However, as soon as we raise these questions and, more particular­
ly, for any posita whatever in so far as they are conceived as deter­
mined exclusively by the pure forms, we find ourselves in formal logic 
and in the above mentioned parallel formal disciplines which, in 
accord with their essence, are built up upon the corresponding theory 
of forms as their lower level. Included in the syntheticalforms — which, as 
forms of positings or posita pertaining to the categories of posita in 
question, obviously presuppose much but leave it undetermined in 
its particularity —  are a priori conditions of possible validity which are 
expressed in the set of eidetic laws which govern the disciplines in question.
Specifically, the a priori conditions of the possibility of doxic cer­
tainty of reason — stated noematically, of possible truth — are included 
in the pure forms of predicative (analytic) syntheses. The Objective 
exhibition <of the doxic certainty of reason> is produced by formal 
logic in the narrowest sense: the formal apophantics (the formal logic of 
“judgments” ) which, thus has its foundation in the theory of forms of 
these “judgments.”
Something similar holds for the synthesizings and their noematic 
correlates belonging to the emotional and conative acts, thus for their 
kinds of synthetical “posita,” the systematic theory of forms of which 
must serve again as the substratum for the structure of the formal 
theory of validity. Actually implicit precisely in the pure synthetical 
forms of these spheres (as, e.g., in the connections of ends and means)
1 a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e : Cf. §§133f., p p . 274-278 [Reading with Schuhmann 274 instead of27 3 in all 
printed editions).

(306) are conditions of the possibility of axiological and practical “truth” In that 
case, by virtue of “Objectivating” which, e.g. is also effected in 
emotional acts, all axiological and practical rationality as we under­
stand it is converted into doxic rationality and, noematically, into 
truthy objectively into actuality: we speak of true or actual goals, 
means, preferences, etc.
Understandably, unique and highly important phenomenological 
investigations are related to all these complexes. Already the kind of 
characterization of the formal disciplines just given is phenomen­
ological and presupposes a great deal from our analyses. In pure logic 
dealt with “dogmatically,” the researcher abstractively seizes upon 
the apophantic forms (“any positum whatever,” or “judgm ent” — 
categorial, hypothetical, conjunctive, disjunctive judgment, etc.) 
and fixes axioms of formal truth for them. He knows nothing of 
analytical synthesis, of noetic-noematic relations of essences, of the 
inclusion of the essence he has singled out, seized upon and conceptu­
ally fixed, in the eidetic complex of pure consciousness; he carries out 
his research in isolation of what can only be understood fully in this 
full eidetic context. Only by regress to the sources of intuition in 
transcendentally purified consciousness does phenomenology make 
clear to us what is properly implied when, at one time, we speak of 
formal conditions of the truth and, at other times, of the forms of 
cognition. Universally, it clarifies for us essences and relations among 
essences which belong to the concepts of cognition, evidence, truth, 
being (object, predicatively formed affair-complex, etc.); it teaches 
us to understand the structure of judgings and judgments, the 
manner in which the structure of the noema is epistemically deter­
minative, how in that connection the “posita” play their special role 
and, again, the differing possibility of its epistemic “fullness.” It 
shows which manners of fulfillment are essential conditions for the 
rational characteristic of evidence, which kinds of evidence are in 
question in any given case; and so forth. It especially allows us to 
understand that involved in the case of a priori truths of logic are eidetic 
connections between the possibility of intuitive fulfillment of the positum 
(whereby the corresponding predicatively formed affair-complex 
enters into synthetical intuition) and the pure synthetical form of the 
positum (of the logically pure form), and that, at the same time, each 
possibility is the condition for possible validity.
Seen more precisely, phenomenology also shows that two things
<307) are to be distinguished here which correspond to the correlation of

noesis and noema. In formal apophantics (e.g., in the syllogistic) we 
speak of judgments, as noematic posita, and their “formal truth.” 
Throughout, the focus is noematic. On the other hand, in the formal 
apophantic noetics the focus is noetic; we speak of rationality, correct­
ness of judging; norms of this correctness are enounced and, more 
particularly, in relation to the forms of posita. For example, one 
cannot maintain a contradiction as true; whoever judges according 
to the forms of the premises of valid modes of inference, “must” draw 
the consequences pertaining to the corresponding forms. In the 
phenomenological context these parallels are understood at once. 
The processes which involve thejudgings, the noesis, as well as those 
corresponding to them in the noema, in the apophansis, are in­
vestigated precisely in their necessary mutual relation and in the full 
weave of consciousness.
The same holds, naturally, for the remaining formal disciplines 
with respect to the parallelism of noetic and noematic regularities.
§148. Problems of the Theory of Reason Pertaining to Formal Ontology.
From those disciplines we are led to turn to the corresponding 
ontologies. The context is already given phenomenologically by the 
universally possible turning of one’s regard which can be effected 
within each act whereby the constituents, which one has as objects of 
one’s regard, are reciprocally combined with one another by various 
eidetic laws. The primary attitude is focused on something objective: 
the noematic reflection leads to the noematic constituents, the noetic 
reflection to noetic compositions. From these constituents the disci­
plines of interest to us here abstractively single out and seize upon 
pure forms and, more particularly, the formal apophantics seizes 
upon noematic forms, the parallel noetics, noetic forms. Just as those 
forms are connected with one another, so both are essentially con­
nected with ontic forms, ontic forms which can be seized upon by 
turning the regard back to ontic constituents.
Each formal-logical law is to be equivalently converted into a 
formal ontological law. Instead of judgments, predicatively formed 
affair-complexes will now be judged about; instead of judgmental 
members (e.g., nominal significations), objects will be judged about; 
instead of predicational significations, characteristic marks will be 
judged about; and so forth. We no longer even speak of truth, of the

validity ofjudicial posita, but rather of the composition pertaining to 
a predicatively formed affair-complex, of the being of objects, and 
the like.
<308) 
Obviously the phenomenological content of this turn is also to be 
clarified by regress to the content of the determining concepts.
Moreover, formal ontology extends very far beyond the spheres of 
such simple conversions pertaining to formal apophantic truths. 
Great disciplines accrue to it by that “nominalization” of which we 
spoke before.2 In plural judging, the plural appears as plural posit­
ing.3 By the nominalizing turn the object becomes the set, and 
accordingly the fundamental concept of the theory of sets arises. In this 
theory, sets are judged about as objects which have their relevant 
kinds of properties, relations, etc. The same is true for the concepts of 
relation, number, etc., as fundamental concepts of mathematical disci­
plines. Again, in the case of the theory of simple forms of posita we 
have to say that it is not the task of phenomenology to develop these 
disciplines, thus to cultivate mathematics, syllogistics, etc. Only the 
axioms and their conceptual composition interest phenomenology as 
names for phenomenological analyses.
W hat has been said is transferred to the formal axiology and the theory 
ofpractice, as well as to the formal ontologies of values (in a very extended 
sense <of the term value>), of goods, which are coordinate to formal 
axiology and theory of practice as theoretical desiderata — in short, 
to the whole ontic spheres which are correlates of emotional and 
conative consciousness.
One will note that in these considerations the concept of “formal ontology” 
has been extended. The concrete values, the practical objectivities, are 
subsumed under the formal name, “objects,” “anything whatever.” 
From the standpoint of universal analytic ontology, they are there­
fore materially determined objects; the relevant “formal” ontologies 
of concrete values and practical objectivities are therefore material 
disciplines. On the other hand, the analogies, grounded in the 
parallelism of posited genera (belief, or modalities of belief, concrete

judging refers back to a collecting consciousness, or else to a plural consciousness already prior 
to predicating. By means of the nominalizing turn, the plural becomes a manifold of objects, 
and accordingly the fundamental concept of the theory of sets arises. (In the presentation in the 
text, it seems as though the plural would arise as singular Object pertaining to the judgmental 
sphere which still was understood here as the sphere of predicative signifying.)

values, willing) and the syntheses and syntactical formations at­
tached to them, have their power and indeed such an efficacious one 
that K ant directly designated4 as “analytic” the relation of willing of 
the end to willing of the means, and thereby certainly confuses <309) 
analogy with identity. The analytic proper, which belongs to the 
predicative synthesis of doxa, need not be confused with its formal 
analogon which is related to the syntheses of emotional and conative 
positings. Profound and important problems pertaining to the 
phenomenology of reason are attached to the radical clarification of 
these analogies and parallels.
§149. The Problems of the Theory of Reason Pertaining to Regional Onto­
logies. The Problem of Phenomenological Constitution.
After having discussed the problems of the theory of reason set for us 
by the formal disciplines, we must make the transition to the material 
and, first of all, the regional, ontologies.
Each objective region is constituted in the manner peculiar to 
consciousness. An object determined by the regional genus has, as 
object, in so far as it is actual, its a priori predesignated modes of 
being perceivable, somehow objectivatable clearly or obscurely, 
conceivable, demonstrable. We thus return again, in view of what 
founds rationality, to senses, posita or propositions, epistemic essen­
ces; but now not to the simple forms: instead, since we have our eye on 
the material universality of regional and categorial essences, we 
return to those posita the determinational content of which is taken 
in its regional determinateness. Each region here furnishes the clues to 
an intrinsically self-contained group of investigations.
Let us take, for example, the region, M aterial Thing, as clue. If we 
correctly understand what this guide means, then at the same time 
we seize upon, accordingly, a universal problem which is deter­
minative for a great and relatively self-contained phenomenological 
discipline: the problem of the universal “constitution” in transcendental 
consciousness of objectivities pertaining to the region, Physical Thing. More 
briefly expressed: “ the phenomenological constitution of any phys­
ical thing whatever.” Along with this we also become acquainted
4 
a u t h o r ’s f o o t n o t e :  Cf. Grundlegung zur Methaphysik der Sitten [Metaphysics of Morals ](A 
417): “He who wills the end also wills the means in his power necessarily indispensable to 
achieving the end. This proposition is, in so far as willing is involved, analytic.”

with the methods of investigation coordinate with this guiding pro­
blem. Precisely the same holds, then, for each region and for each 
discipline related to its phenomenological constitution.
W hat is involved is the following: the idea of the physical thing, to 
remain with this region, if we speak of it now, is represented in the 
manner peculiar to consciousness by the conceptual thought, “phys­
ical thing,” with a certain noematic composition. To every noema 
(310) there essentially corresponds an ideally closed group of possible 
noemata which have their unity by being capable of a synthetical 
unification by coincidence. If the noema, as here, is a harmonious 
one, then intuitive and especially originarily presentive noemata are 
found in the group — noemata in which all other sorts of noemata of 
the group are fulfilled in the identifying coincidence, drawing from 
them the confirmation, the fullness of the power of reason in the case 
of positionality.
We thus proceed from the verbal, perhaps quite obscure, ob­
jectivation of the physical thing as we directly have it. In freedom we 
generate intuitive objectivations of the same any- “physical thing” - 
whatever and we make the vague sense of the word clear to us. Since a 
“universal objectivation” is involved, we must proceed by way of 
example. Let us generate optional intuitions in phantasy of physical 
things, such as free intuitions of winged horses, white ravens, golden 
mountains, and the like; they would, in any case, be physical things, 
and objectivations of them therefore serve as examples just as well as 
objectivations of the physical things given to actual experience. 
Effecting ideation on that basis, in intuitive clarity we seize upon the 
essence, “physical thing,” as the subject of universally delimited 
noematic determinations.
It must now be noticed (recalling what has already been es­
tablished earlier5) that, in this connection, the essence, “physical 
thing,” is, to be sure, originarily given, but that this givenness of 
essential necessity can never be an adequate one. We can make the 
noema or the physical thing-sense adequately given to us; but the 
multiple physical thing-senses, even taken in their fullness, do not 
contain the regional essence, “physical thing,” as an originarily- 
intuitive composition immanent in them, no more than the multiple 
senses related to one and the same physical thing contain the indi­
vidual cssence of the physical thing. In other words, regardless of

whether it is a question of the essence of a physical thing-individuum 
or of the regional essence, “any physical thing whatever,” there is no 
case in which a single intuition of a physical thing or a finite, closed 
continuity or collection of intuitions of physical things would be 
sufficient to acquire in an adequate manner the desired essence in the 
whole fullness ofits essential determinatenesses. But that suffices for 
an inadequate seeing of essences; in contrast to an empty seizing upon 
an essence such as one to be established on the exempflicative 
substratum of an obscure objectivation, it always has the great 
advantage of having the essence originarily given.
This is true for all levels of eidetic universality, from the essence ofan <311) 
individual all the way up to the region, Physical Thing.
Now, however, it is a generical eidetic insight that each imperfect 
givenness6 (each inadequately presentive noema) includes in itself a rule 
for the ideal possibility of its being perfected. It belongs to the essence of the 
appearance of the centaur which I now have — a merely “one-sided” 
appearance presentive of the essence of the centaur — that I can 
trace out the different sides of the physical thing, that what remains 
undetermined and open in the first place can be made determinate 
and intuitive in free phantasy. In the continuation of this always 
more perfect intuitional, more precisely determining process of 
phantasy, we are in a wide measure free; indeed, at random we can 
intuitionally ascribe to the phantasied centaur more precisely deter­
mining properties and changes in properties; but we are not completely 
free provided we ought to progress in the sense of a harmonious course 
of intuition in which the subject to be determined is identically the 
same and can always remain harmoniously determinable. We are, 
e.g., bound by a law-conforming space as a frame prescribed for us by 
the idea of any possible/physical thing whatever. However arbitrarily 
we may deform w ha/is phantasied, spatial forms are always again 
converted into spatial forms.
But what does it mean phenomenologically to speak of rule or law?
W hat is implied by the fact that the inadequately given region,
6Insertion in Copy D to the beginning of this paragraph (published by Schuhmann as Appendix 75, ca.
1915): It should be noted that by “imperfect givenness” we understand precisely a givenncss 
which, as a givenness, can include no discordancies, e.g., the inadequate appearance of an 
object. Discordancies can enter in through syntheses, e.g., when further objectivations and, 
more particularly, those which, with respect to the X, coincide with the appearance, are 
combined with the appearance of the object. How we understand the word “apprehension” in 
all contexts where we impute an apprehension to an appearance, is a question there not of an 
objectivation proper, but instead of a characteristic, etc.

“physical thing ” prescribes rules for the course of intuitions — and that 
signifies, manifestly, as well for possible perceptions?
The answer is: There belong to the essence ofsuch a physical thing- 
noema, and with absolute evidence, ideal possibilities of “limitlessness 
in the progression”7 of harmonious intuitions and, more particularly, 
according to typically determined predesignated directions (there­
fore also parallel limitlessnesses in the continuous sequential con­
catenations of the corresponding noeses). Let us recall here the 
earlier expositions concerning the acquisition by intellectual seeing 
of the universal “idea,” Any Physical Thing Whatever, which re­
mains valid for each lower level of universality down to the lowest 
concretion of the individually determined physical thing. Its tran­
scendence is expressed in each limitlessness in the progression of 
intuitions of it. Always and again the intuitions are to be converted 
<312) into intuitional continua and the pregiven continua are to be ampli­
fied. No perception of the physical thing is definitively closed; there is 
always room for new perceptions, for determining more precisely the 
indeterminatenesses, for fulfilling the unfulfilled. With every pro­
gression the determinational content of the physical thing-noema, 
which continually belongs to the same physical thing-X, is enriched. 
It is an eidetic insight that each perception and multiplicity of per­
ceptions is capable of being amplified; the process is thus an endless 
one; accordingly, no intuitive seizing upon the physical thing-essence 
can be so complete that a further perception cannot noematically 
contribute something new to it.
On the other hand, we still seize upon the “idea,” Physical Thing, 
with evidence and adequately. In the consciousness of the limitless­
ness of the progression of harmonious intuitions, we seize upon <the 
“ idea” > in the free process of running-through. We first of all seize 
upon the unfulfilled idea of the physical thing and this individual 
physical thing as something which is given “so far,” precisely as far as 
the harmonious intuition “reaches,” but thereby remains determin­
able “ in infinitum.” The “etc.” is an evident and absolutely indispens­
able moment in the physical thing-noema.
On the basis of the consciousness of this limitlessness as an 
example, we seize upon, furthermore, the “idea” of determined 
directions of infinity and, more particularly, for each of the directions
7 a u t h o r ' s f o o t n o t l : Cf Kant, K n t i k  der remen Vernunft, the fifth argument about space (A 
2T)'i [Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, translated by Norman Kemp Smith (London, 1953), p. 69.]

of the intuitional course which we run through. Again we seize upon 
the regional “idea” of any physical thing whatever as of something identical 
which is being maintained in the course determined as of such a type 
and being manifested in the determinately articulated infinite series 
of noemata which belong to it.
Like the physical thing, so each property belonging to the eidetic 
content, and, above all, each constitutive “form,” is an idea; and this 
holds from the regional universality all the way down to the lowest 
particularity. Explained more precisely:
In its ideal essence, the physical thing is given as res temporalis, in 
the necessary “form” of time. The intuitive “ideation” (which quite 
particularly deserves its name as the seeing of the “idea” ) acquaints 
us with the physical thing as necessarily enduring, as of necessity 
endlessly extendable in view ofits duration. In “pure intuition” (for 
this ideation is the phenomenologically clarified concept of K ant’s 
pure intuition) we seize upon the “idea” of temporality and all the 
essential moments included in it.
The physical thing is, furthermore, according to its idea, res 
extensa; it is capable, e.g., with respect to space, of infinitely multiple 
changes in form and, in the case where the shape and alterations in <313) 
shape are retained as identical, of infinitely multiple alterations of 
place; it is “moveable” in infinitum. We seize upon the “idea” of space 
and the ideas included in it.
Finally, the physical thing is a res materialis; it is a substantial unity 
and as such a unity it is a unity of causalities and, with respect to 
possibility, of infinitely complex causalities. With these specifically 
real properties we also encounter ideas. Thus all components of the 
idea of the physical thing are themselves ideas; each one implies the 
“and so forth” of “infinite” possibilities.
W hat we have carried^ut here is not “theory,” “metaphysics.” It 
is a matter of eidetic liecessities indefeasibly included in the physical 
thing-noema and, correlatively, in the consciousness presentive of 
the physical thing, to be seized upon throughout by intellectual 
seeing and to be systematically investigated.
§150. Continuation. The Region, Physical Thing, As Transcendental Clue.
After having made understandable to ourselves in the most universal 
terms the infinities which the intuition of the physical thing as

physical thing (with respect to noesis and noema) includes in itself— 
or, as we can also say: the idea of the physical thing and the 
dimensions of infinity which it includes in itself— soon we shall be 
able to understand too the extent to which the region, Physical Thing, 
can serve as clue for phenomenological investigations.
Intuiting an individual physical thing, its movements, its 
approaching and receding, its revolvings, its alterations in form and 
quality, pursuing in intuition its modes of causal relations, we effect 
continua of intuitings which coincide thus and so, which join tog­
ether into a unity-consciousness: the regard is accordingly directed to 
the identical, to the X of the sense (or of the posited or neutralized 
positum), to the one and the same itself changing, revolving, etc. The 
case is the same when we follow after, in free intuition, the infinitely 
possible modifications with respect to the different fundamental 
directions in the consciousness of limitlessness in progression pertain­
ing to this intuitional process. And likewise, again, when we go over 
to the attitude of ideation and, let us say, make clear the regional idea 
of the physical thing: thus proceeding in that case like the geometer in 
the freedom and purity of his geometrical intuition.
But with all of this we do not know anything about the processes of 
<314) intuition itself and the essence and essential infinities which pertain 
to <intuition>; we know nothing about the latter’s stuff and noetic 
moments, nothing about its noematic constituents, about the dif­
ferentiable and eidetically graspable strata on both sides. W hat we 
actually livingly experience (or are conscious of in phantasy modifi- 
t&tion) we do not see. Therefore a change in attitude is required; the 
different hyletic, noetic, noematic “reflections” are required (col­
lectively quite correctly named “reflections” since they are deviat­
ions of the original “straightforward1’ direction of the regard to the 
X). It is these reflections which now open up for us a great field of 
research, coherent in itself; that is to say, a powerful set of problems 
subsumed under the idea of the region, Physical Thing.
This, then, raises the question:
How are we to describe systematically the noeses and noemas belonging to the 
unity of the intuitively objectivating consciousness of the physical thing?
If we confine ourselves to the noematic sphere, then the question is: 
How do the multiple posited intuitions, the “ intuitional posita” look in 
which an “actual” physical thing becomes given and, in the manner 
peculiar to intuition, shows its actuality in originaliter “experience”?
In order to abstract from the doxic position, how do the mere —

noematically understood — appearances look, appearances which, in 
themselves, considered purely eidetically, “make appear” one and 
the same physical thing, the quite determined physical thing at any 
time, which belongs to this intuition-multiplicity or appearance- 
multiplicity as a necessary correlate? O f essential necessity, phenome­
nology does not remain with vague talk, with obscure universalities; 
it demands systematically determined clarification, analysis and 
description which penetrate into eidetic complexes and down to the 
ultimate particularizations attainable of those complexes: phenome­
nology demands exhaustive work.
The regional idea of the physical thing, its identical X with its 
determining sense-content, posited as existing, prescribes rules governing 
the multiplicities of appearances. That means: there are no multiplicities 
whatever which accidentally come together, which already follows 
from the fact that, in themselves, purely essentially, they have a 
relationship to the physical thing, the determined physical thing.
The idea of the region prescribes a quite determined, determinately 
ordered, strictly closed series of appearances progressing in infinitum 
taken as an ideal collectivity — a determined, internal organization 
of their flows which, in conformity with essence and accessible to 
investigation, cohere with partial ideas universally designated in the 
regional idea of the physical thing as its components. It is shown, for <315) 
example — as a concrete portion of this organization — that the 
unity of a mere res extensa is conceivable without the unity for which 
the idea of the res materialis is a norm: although no res materialis is 
conceivable which would not be a res extensa. It becomes apparent 
(always in eidetic phenomenological intuition) that each physical 
thing-appearance necessarily includes in itself a stratum which we 
call the physical thing-schema: it is the spatial shape merely filled with 
“sensuous” qualities -p^vithout any determinateness of “substant­
iality” and “causality” (scl. in inverted commas, understood as 
noematically modified). Already the relevant idea of a mere res 
extensa is the name for a wealth of phenomenological problems.
There are many affairs which we take as simple facts in phenomen­
ological naivete: that to “us hum an beings” a spatial thing always 
appears in a certain “orientation,” e.g., oriented in the visual field of 
sight with respect to above and below, left and right, near and far; 
that we can see a physical thing only at a certain “depth,” “distance;” 
that all the changing distances at which it is to be seen are related 
to an invisible center of all depth-orientations familiar to us as an

ideal limit-point which we “localize” in the head — all these alleged 
facticities, thus contingencies of intuition of space, which are alien to 
the “ true,” the “objective” space, prove to be eidetic necessities even 
in the least significant empirical particularities. It is shown, there­
fore, that something such as a physical thing in space is only in- 
tuitable by means of appearances in which it is and must be given in 
multiple but determined changing “perspective” modes and, ac­
cordingly, in changing “orientations” not just for human beings but 
also for God — as the ideal representative of absolute cognition.
It is now necessary not only to legitimate this as a universal thesis 
but to follow it through in accord with all single formations. The 
problem of the “origin of the idea of space” the profoundest phenomeno­
logical sense of which has never been grasped, is reduced to the 
phenomenological analysis of the essence of all the noematic (and 
noetic) phenomena in which space is intuitively presented and is 
“constituted” as the unity of appearances, of descriptive modes of 
presentation of something spatial.
Accordingly, the problem of constitution clearly signifies nothing else 
but that the regulated series of appearances necessarily belonging 
together in the unity of what appears can become intuitively sur- 
<316) veyed and seized upon theoretically — in spite of their infinities 
(unambiguously controllable precisely in the determined “and so 
forth” ) — : that, in their eidetic own peculiarity, they are analyzable 
and describable; and that the law-conforming production of perfect corre­
lation between what determinately appears as unity and the determinately infinite 
multiplicities of appearances can become fully seen intellectually and 
thus all enigmas can be removed.
This holds likewise for the unity inherent in the res extensa (the res 
temporalis, too), thus also no less for higher unities, the founded ones, 
which the expression, “material physical thing,” i.e., the substantial- 
causal physical thing, indicates. All these unities are constituted at the 
level of experiencing intuition in “multiplicities,” and everywhere 
the eidetic concatenations of both sides must be illuminated 
completely in all their strata with respect to sense and sense-fullness, 
positional functions, etc. Finally, there must emerge from this perfect 
intellectual seeing of what the idea of the actual physical thing represents in 
phenomenologically pure consciousness, how it is the absolutely necessary 
correlate of a structurally investigated and eidetically described 
noetic-noematic complex.

§151. The Strata of the Transcendental Constitution of the Physical Thing. 
Supplementations.
These investigations are essentially determined by the different levels 
and strata of physical thing-constitution in the frami of originary experiencing 
consciousness. Every level, and every stratum in the level, is character­
ized by the fact that it constitutes an own peculiar unity which, on its side, 
is a necessary middle member for the full constitution of the physical 
thing.
If we take, for example, the level of the perceptual physical 
thing-constitution, the correlate of which is the thing pertaining to the 
senses furnished with sensuous qualities, then we refer to a single 
stream of consciousness, to the possible perceptions of a single per­
ceiving Ego-subject. Here we find many sorts ofunity-strata: sensuous 
schemata, the “sight things” of a higher and lower order which must be 
perfectly exhibited in this order and studied with respect to their 
noetic-noematic constitution both in isolation and in their intercon­
nectedness. At the highest strata pertaining to this level there is the 
substantial-causal physical thing, already a reality in the specific sense of 
the term, but always still constitutively restricted to one experiencing <317) 
subject and his ideal perceptual multiplicities.
The next higher level is then the inter subjectively identical physical thing
— a constitutive unity of a higher order. Its constitution is related to 
an open plurality in relation to subjects “understanding one an­
other.” The intersubjective world is the correlate of intersubjective 
experience, i.e., <experience> mediated by “empathy.” We are, as a 
consequence, referred to the multiple unities of things pertaining to 
the senses which are already individually constituted by the many 
subjects; in further course we are referred to the corresponding 
perceptual multiplicities thus belonging to different Ego-subjects 
and streams of consciousness; above all, however, we are referred to 
the novel factor of empathy and to the question of how it plays a 
constitutive role in “Objective” experience and bestows unity on 
those separated multiplicities.
Moreover, all the investigations must be carried out in the 
completeness and comprehensiveness required by the essence of the 
affairs in question. Thus, in conformity with the goals of an intro­
duction, we have, above, fixed our regard on merely a first, a 
fundamental, system of constituting multiplicities of appearances, 
that is to say, those in which one and the same physical thing always

harmoniously appears. In limitless progressions with respect to all 
systematic lines, perceptions become purely coincident, the positings 
continually undergo confirmation. There is only more precise deter­
mination here, never determination otherwise. None of the physical 
thing-determinations which have been posited by the previous flow 
of experience (within this inherently-ideally closed system) undergo 
“cancellation” and “substitution” by other determinations pertain­
ing to the same category of determination which is formally predesig­
nated by the regional essence. There are no disturbances of the 
harmony and no processes which counterbalance the disturbances, 
not to mention that “exploding” of the harmony by which the 
posited physical thing is entirely cancelled. But now these counter 
cases are no less to be accounted for phenomenologically since they 
too play or can play their role in the complex of possible constitution 
of experiential actuality. The pathway of factual as well as ideally 
possible cognition leads through errors, even at the lowest cognitive 
level, the level of intuitively seizing upon actuality. Thus the per­
ceptual flows, in which partial ruptures of harmony occur and in 
which the harmony is to be preserved only by means of “cor­
rections,” are to be systematically characterized with respect to the 
<318) noetic and noematic essential constituents: apprehensional altera­
tions, own specific positional processes, the transvaluation and de­
valuation of what was apprehended before, e.g., as “semblance,” 
“illusion,” transition to a “conflict” unresolved here and there; and 
so forth. Over against the continuous synthesis of harmony, the 
syntheses of conflict, of misinterpretations and determination 
otherwise, and whatever else they may be called, must be given their 
due: for a phenomenology of “ true actuality” the phenomenology of 
“nullifying illusion” is also quite indispensable.
§ 152. Extension of the Problem of Transcendental Constitution to Other 
Regions.
We see at once that what was said here by way of example for the 
constitution of the material physical thing — and, more particularly, 
what was said with respect to the constitution in the system of 
multiplicities of experience prior to all “ thinking” — must be 
extended to all regions of objects with respect to problems and with 
respect to methods. For “sensuous perceptions” there now enter,

naturally, the kinds of originarily presentive acts essentially coor­
dinate to the regions in question — acts which must be exhibited and 
investigated beforehand.
Very difficult problems are attached to the interwovenness of different 
regions. They condition combinations in the constituting fashionings 
of consciousness. The physical thing is nothing isolated in contrast to 
the experiencing subject, as has already been noted in the indications 
above concerning the intersubjective constitution of the “Objective” 
physical thing-world. Now, however, this experiencing subject is 
himself constituted in experience as something real, as human being or 
as brute, just as the intersubjective communities are constituted as com­
munities of humans and other animals.
Although essentially founded in psychical realities which, for their 
part, are founded in physical realities, these communities prove to be 
novel objectivities of a higher order. Universally it is shown that there are 
many sorts of objectivities which defy all psychologistic and natural­
istic misinterpretations. Such are all kinds of value-objects and practical 
objects, all concrete cultural formations which determine our actual 
life as hard realities, such as the state, the law, custom, the churchy and so 
forth. Objectnesses must be described with respect to fundamental <319) 
kinds and in their hierarchies just as they become given, and the 
problems of constitution set and solved for them.
Quite clearly their constitution also leads back to that of some­
thing physical in space and to psychical subjects: they are founded 
precisely in such realities. As the lowest level, finally, material reality 
grounds all other realities and, as a consequence, the phenomenology of 
material Nature assuredly acquires a pre-eminent place. But seen without 
prejudice and phenomenologically led back to their sources, the 
founded unities are Precisely founded and novel; the novel factor, 
which is constitute^ with them, can, as eidetic intuition teaches, 
never become reduced to the mere sum of other realities. Thus in fact 
each own specifically peculiar type of such actualities carries along with it its 
own peculiar constitutive phenomenology and therefore a new concrete theory 
of reason. In every case the task is essentially the same: It is necessary 
to make cognized with respect to all levels and strata the complete 
system of fashionings of consciousness which constitute the originary 
givenness of all such Objectivenesses, and consequently to make un­
derstandable the consciousness-equivalent of the kind of “actuality” 
in question. Also everything which can be truthfully said here in 
order to preclude the many and obvious misunderstandings involved

in the correlation of being and consciousness (as, e.g., that all actu­
ality is “resolved into the psychical” ), can only be said on the basis of 
the eidetic interrelations of the constitutive groups seized upon in the 
phenomenological attitude and in the light of intuition.
§153. The full Extension of the Transcendental Problem. The Articulation of 
the Investigations.
A discussion of so general a sort which has only been possible up to 
now cannot evoke an adequate idea of the enormous extent of the 
investigations recognized and required as possible so far. To that 
end, at least for the major types of actualities, portions of detailed 
investigations would be needed; it would, therefore, be necessary to 
proceed as we did with respect to the set of problems pertaining to the 
universal structures of consciousness. Meanwhile in the next Book 
discussion of the controversies which occupy so much of current 
thought concerning the mutual relationship of the groups of sciences 
<320) designated by the names of the natural sciences, psychology and the 
cultural sciences, and especially concerning their relationship to 
phenomenology, will provide the occasion, at the same time, to draw 
the problems of constitution into an accessible proximity. But so much 
should already have been made clear here: that the controversies 
actually involve serious problems and that provinces of investiga­
tions have been opened up concerning everything which is, in the genuine 
sense, essentially necessary to all sciences with a material content. The “es­
sential and fundamental” is indeed nothing else but what is grouped 
around the regional ideas according to the basic concepts and basic 
cognitions, and what finds or must find its systematic unfolding in the 
corresponding regional ontologies.
W hat has been said is extended from the sphere of material objects 
to the sphere of formal objects and to the ontological disciplines approp­
riate to the latter, therefore to all principles and any sciences whatever 
based on principles — provided that we suitably broaden the idea of 
constitution. The frames of constitutive inquiry are accordingly, of 
course, broadened such that what has been said can encompass the 
whole of phenomenology.
That will emerge by itself when we add the following supplemen­
tary considerations:
In the first place, there are the problems of the constitution of

objects related to the multiplicities of possible originarily presentive 
consciousness. Thus, for example, in the case of physical things, there 
are the problems related to the totality of possible experiences, indeed, 
perceptions of one and the same physical things. Following upon this 
is the supplementary consideration of the reproductive sorts of posit­
ing consciousness and the explorations of their constitutive rational 
production or, what amounts to the same thing, their production for 
intuitive cognition simpliciter; the same is the case for consideration 
of the obscurely objectivating (but simpliciter) consciousness and the 
problems of reason and actuality related to it. In short, we move, first 
of all, in the mere sphere of “objectivation”
But connected with that are the corresponding investigations 
which refer to the productions of a higher sphere, the so-called “sphere 
of the understanding” or of “reason” in the narrower sense of the term, with 
their explicating, relating and otherwise “logical” (also, then, axi­
ological and practical) syntheses; with their “conceptual” operat­
ions, their statements, their new mediating forms of grounding. 
Objectivities which were given first of all in monothetical acts, let us say, 
in simple experiences (or conceived as given in the idea), can be 
made subject to the play of synthetical operations and by virtue of them 
constitute synthetical objectivities of an always higher level — ob- <321) 
jectivities which contain a number of positings in the unity of the 
positing as a whole and which contain a number of materials stand­
ing out as members in the unity of their total material. One can 
collect, “fashioning” collectiva (sets) of different hierarchical orders 
(sets of sets); one can “single out” or “abstract” “parts” from 
“wholes,” properties, predicates in their subjects; one can “ relate” 
objects to objects, at will “making” this one into the referential term, 
the other into the object referred to; and so forth. One can effect such 
syntheses “actually,” “properly,” i.e., in synthetical originarity; then, 
in accord with its synthetical form, the synthesized objectivity has the 
characteristic of being originarily given (e.g., <the characteristic) of 
the actually given collection, subsumption, relation, etc.), and it has 
the full characteristic of originarity if the positings have it, thus if the 
positing act-characteristics are originarily motivated as rational.
One can also draw upon free phantasies, relate the originarily given 
and the quasi-given, or else effect the syntheses exclusively in the 
form of modification, change the object of consciousness into a 
“supposed” object, “frame” hypotheses, “draw consequences” from 
them; or else draw comparisons and distinctions, subject the similar-

ities and differences themselves given in them to synthetical operat­
ions combined with all the ideations, eidetic positions and sup­
positions; and thus in infinitum.
Moreover, underlying the operations are acts which are partly 
intuitional, partly non-intuitional, or else quite confused, of lower and 
higher levels of Objectivation. In the case of obscurity or confusion, 
one can set out to clarify the synthetically “ produced formations,” to 
raise the question of their possibility, of their resolution by means of 
“synthetical intuition;” or also the question of their “actuality,” of 
their being resolved by means of explicit and originarily presentive 
synthetical acts, or by way of mediate “inferences” or “proofs.” 
Phenomenologically, all of these types of synthesis, in perfect corre­
lation with the synthetically “constituted” objectivities in them, are 
to be submitted to investigation; the different modes of givenness and 
their signification for “actual being” of such objectivities, or for truly 
being possible, for actually being probable, are to be clarified; and the 
same is the case for all questions of reason, truth and actuality. Thus 
here too we have “problems of constitution ”
Now, the logical syntheses are, to be sure, grounded in the lowest 
positings with simple materials (senses), but in a manner such that 
<322) the system of eidetic laws pertaining to the levels of synthesis, and 
specifically the laws of reason — in a very broad, determinately 
delimited “formal” sphere — are independent of the particular 
materials of the members of the synthesis. Precisely by this means a 
universal and formal logic indeed becomes possible, <a logio which 
abstracts from the “m aterial” of logical cognition and thinks it in 
undetermined, freely variable universality (as “something or other” ) 
As a consequence, the investigations related to constitution are also distinguished 
into those which, on the one hand, follow the basic formal concepts 
and take them alone as “clues” to problems of reason, or problems of 
actuality and of truth; on the other hand, those which, as previously 
sketched, follow the basic regional concepts and, in first place, the 
concept of the region itself, and, to be sure, with the question of how 
something individual in such a region attains to givenness. With the 
regional categories and the investigations predesignated by them, jus­
tice is done to the particular determination which the synthetical form 
undergoes by virtue of the regional material; and <justice is done> likewise to 
the influence which the particular restrictions (such as find expression in 
the regional axioms) exercise on the regional actuality
Manifestly what has been explained is transferred to all spheres of

acts and objects, therefore also to the objectivities for the constituting of 
which emotional acts with their specific positings and materials have to be a 
priori responsible, and in a manner again with respect to form and 
material particularity, which it is the great, scarcely suspected, let 
alone adopted, task of the corresponding constitutive phenome­
nology to clarify.
As a consequence, the intimate relationship of the constitutive 
phenomenologies to the a priori ontologies and, finally, to all eidetic 
disciplines, also becomes evident (excepting, here, phenomenology 
itself). The sequence of levels of formal and material theories of essence 
prescribes in a certain way the sequence of levels of the constitutive phenome­
nologies, determines their levels of universality and provides them 
with “clues” in the ontological and materially eidetic fundamental 
concepts and principles. By way of example, the fundamental con­
cepts of the ontology of Nature, such as time, space, matter, and their 
immediate derivatives, are indices to strata of constituting conscious­
ness of material thingness, just as the relevant fundamental principles 
are indices to connections of essences in and between the strata. The <323) 
phenomenological clarification pertaining to pure logic makes it 
understandable, then, that and why also all mediate propositions 
pertaining to the pure theory of time, of geometry, and thus of all 
ontological disciplines, are indices to sets of eidetic laws of transcend­
ental consciousness and its constituting multiplicities.
But it must be explicitly noted that in these interrelations between 
constitutive phenomenologies and the corresponding formal and 
material ontologies nothing is implied about the grounding of the former by 
the latter. The phenomenologist does not judge ontologically when he cognizes 
an ontological concept or principle as an index to constitutive eidetic 
complexes, whefn he sees a clue in them for intuitive validations 
which bear purely within themselves their right and validity. This 
universal finding will be verified for us much later in more basic 
expositions which are, in any case, required by virtue of the im­
portance of this situation.
A comprehensive solution to the problems of constitution which 
equally takes into consideration the noetic and the noematic strata of 
consciousness would be manifestly equivalent to a complete 
phenomenology of reason with respect to all its formal and material 
fashionings and, at the same time, with respect to its non-normal 
(negatively rational) as well as its normal (positively rational) 
<fashionings>. But it must be admitted, furthermore, that so complete

a phenomenology of reason would become coincident with 
phenomenology taken universally, that a systematic working out of 
all descriptions of consciousness required by the collective name, 
constitution of objects, must include in itself all descriptions what­
ever of consciousness.

Note of Translator: The subject index is based on that of Ludwig Landgrebe, published in the 
third edition of Ideen, 1928. The page numbers refer to the pagination of the first edition printed 
in the margins of the text. In this connection, see Schuhmann’s comments in Husserliana m/1, pp. 
472f.; Gerda Walther’s autobiography, <\um Anderen Ufer (Remagen: Otto Reichl Verlag,
