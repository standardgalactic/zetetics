Modular arithmetic  is referenced in number theory, group theory, ring 
theory, knot theory, abstract algebra, computer algebra, computer science, 
chemistry and the visual and musical arts. 
 
 
It is also one of the foundations of number theory, touching on almost every aspect of its 
study and provides key examples for group theory, ring theory and abstract algebra. 
 
Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where 
numbers “wrap around” upon reaching a certain value – the 
modulus. 
 
 
The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by 
Carl Friedrich Gauss, in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, which 
was published in 1801.  
 
 
 
For a positive integer n, two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n,  
and as written as 


n
b
a
mod

, if their difference 
b
a 
is an integer multiple of n  
(or n divides 
b
a 
, while integers congruent to a modulo n are creating a set  
called congruence class, residue class or simply residue of the integer a, modulo n.

Illustration of the Modular Arithmetic 
 
 
A familiar use of modular arithmetic is in 
the 12-hour clock, in which the day is divided into 
two 12-hour periods.  
 
If the time is 9:00 now, then 4 hours later it 
will be 1:00.  
 
Usual addition would suggest that the later time should be 9 + 4 = 13, but this is not the 
answer because clock time "wraps around" every 12 hours; in 12-hour time, there is no "13 
o'clock". The added 4 hours will then give the 1:00 time. 
 
Using the notion of modular arithmetic, specifically the basic concept of the theory of 
congruences: 


n
b
a
mod

 
 
We let a be the result of adding 4 hours to the original time 9:00, hence: 
 
a = 9 + 4 = 13 
 
Since the hour number starts over after it reaches 12, this is arithmetic modulo 12. So we let 
n be equal to 12 and b be the equivalent time after the addition of hours. 
 
 
 
 
        
 
 
    
 
 1 is the remainder so it gives the desired 1:00 time 
 
This congruence is true since 12 divides (13 – 1)=12. 
 
Likewise, if the clock starts at 12:00 (noon) and 21 hours elapse, then the time will be 9:00 
the next day, rather than 33:00.  
 
12 is congruent not only to 12 itself, but also to 0, so the time called "12:00" could also be 
called "0:00", since 12 is congruent to 0 modulo 12.This analogy is a little loose. The proper way to 
interpret this is that the group of integers modulo n act on the numbers of a clock, rather than the 
numbers on the clock being added together. Adding together two times on a clock is an example of 
a type error. However, it provides a useful way to understand the concept for the first time. 
 
There are many other applications of congruence in different areas of living, may it be in 
sports, work-related tasks, security concerns or even the daily routine and expenses. 
 
Time is money, as what other people say. Whether a person is setting appointments, 
payment arrangements or planning holidays, determining the day of the week for any given date is 
always helpful – and this is one of the many practical and relevant uses of the theory discussed 
above.

Instructor’s Guide: 
 
After making sure that the students understood this part of review, you may ask        
them some other illustrations of the modular arithmetic for intervention purposes. 

 
Skip Counting to determine the day of the week for a given date may be very helpful 
when dealing with small intervals between two dates. Whenever given with a very large number 
of days to count, this may not be of practical use anymore, what more if one is given a date in 
the past or a day in the future which is very far from the reference date. Try to answer the 
following questions below:   
 Do you know on what day you were born? 
Do you know on what day you were born? Do you know on what day we will be celebrating 
Do you know on what day we will be celebrating Christmas of 2014? 
Christmas of 2014? Can you predict the day when 2020 would officially start? 
Can you predict the day when 2020 would officially start?  
 
 
There is actually a way for us to easily determine these days. Discover it yourselves with 
everything presented on the next pages!

 PERPETUAL CALENDAR 
PERPETUAL CALENDAR 
A perpetual calendar is a calendar valid for many years, usually 
designed to allow the calculation of the day of the week for a given date 
in the future. In this section, an interesting formula will be developed to 
determine the day of the week for any date in any year. But before 
accomplishing this goal, we must be given with a hint of the historical development of the 
popular calendar. A hint of history… 
A hint of history… 
 
 
Around 738 B.C. , Romulus, the legendar founder of Rome, is said to have introduced a 
calendar consisting of 10 months, comprising a year of 304 days. His successor, Nauma, is 
credited with adding two months to the calenda. This new calendar was followed until Julius 
Ceasar changed  the Egyptian calendar, which was based on a year of exactly 365 days, to a 
new calendar – the Julian calendar – with a year of average length of 365 ¼ days, with leap 
years every fourth year, to better reflect the true length of the year. The Julian calendar 
consisted of 12 months of 30 and 31 days, except for February, which had 29 days  and every 
fourth yea, 30 days. 
 
However, more recent calculations have shown that  the true length of the year is 
approximately 365.2422 days. As the centuries passed, the discrepancies of 0.0078 days per 
year added  up, so that by the year 1582 approximately 10 extra days had been added 
unnecessarily as leap years. To remedy this, in 1582, Pope Gregory set up a new calendar.  
First, 10 days were added to the date, so that October 5, 1582 became October 15, 1582 (and 
the 6th through the 14th of October were skipped) 
 
The Gregorian calendar designates those century yeas divisible by 400 as leap years; all 
noncentury years divisible by 4 are also leap years. As an example, the year 1700, 1974, 1800, 
1900 and 2100 are not leap years but 1600, 1776 and 2000 are. With this arrangement. 
 
The Gregorian calendar, now used throughout the world, is so accurate that it differs to the 
true year by 0.0003. The average length of 365.2425 days is rather close to the true year of 
365.2422 days. The result is an error of 3 days per 10000 years.  
 
In dealing with calendar dates for various parts of the world, we must also take into 
account the fact that the Gregorian calendar was not adopted everywhere in 1582. In Britain, 
the Gregorian calendar was adopted  only in 1752, and by then , it was necessary to add 11 
days. Japan changed over 1873, the Soviet Union and nearby countries in 1917, while Greece 
held out until 1923.  
 
 
 
 
 
Instructor’s Guide: 
 
This should not be an optional part of the discussion. Without this section, the 
students might find it difficult to understand some important concepts of the perpetual 
calendar. 

 
 PERPETUAL CALENDAR
PERPETUAL CALENDAR
 
The first century leap year occurred in 1600 which is 18 years after the introduction 
of the Gregorian calendar; so the algorithm discussed below was developed to hold for years beyond 
1600.   
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ALGORITHM: 
Also, since a leap year adds a day to February, we will count the New Year beginning with 
March 1.  
For example, January 3000 is considered the 11th month of 2999, whereas April 
3000 is the 2nd month of year 3000. 
Also, February 29 of 1976 is the last day of the 12th month of 1975. 
We will assign these numbers for the months (m), and days (d) of the week. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For example, d = 3 denotes Wednesday and m = 5 denotes July. 
Also, d = 0 denotes Sunday and m = 11 denotes January. 
 
To compute d  from d1600 
 
 
We let dy denote the day of the week of March 1 (the first day of the year) in year y, 
where

To determine d1600 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Extension of Formula B: 
 
 
To generalize the formula, we need to know the number of days the first of the month is 
moved up from that of the previous month modulo 7.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is the summary for the monthly additional values. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example: 
Because March 1, 1994 fell on a Tuesday, d1994=2. For y= 1994, C=19 and D=94 
 
 
Thus, d1600  was a Wednesday. And substituting for d1600 in the formula A, 
 
 
The day of the first of the month following a 30-day month is advanced by 2 days. 
The day of the first of the month following a 31-day month is advanced by 3 days. 
 
Example: 
 
December 1, 1992 was a Tuesday. So January 1, 1993 fell on 
day (2 +3) = 5, which is a Friday. 
           March 1 to April 1:    3 days 
     April 1 to May 1:    2 days 
     May 1 to June 1:    3 days 
    June 1 to July 1:     2 days 
          July 1 to August 1:     3 days 
August 1 to September 1:     3 days 
  September 1 to October 1:    2 days 
      October 1 to November:    3 days 
November 1 to December 1:    2 days 
    December 1 to January 1:    3 days 
      January 1 to February 1:    3 days 
Instructor’s Guide: 
 
If not time-constrained, you may also ask the students to solve for themselves  
and identify the incremental values for each month, instead of giving them right away, 
 

To find a function f that produces these increments: 
 
As what can be observed from the summary given, the sum of the increments is 29 days, the 
average of which is

C = the first two digits of the year 
r = given day of the given month 
D = last two digits of the year 
m = number code for the given month (March as the 1st month) 
 
This formula helps us to determine the day of the week of any 
given date in the Gregorian calendar.  
Determine the day of the week on which January 13, 2020, falls. 
Solution: 
 
Since January is the 11th month of 2019, so y=2019, hence, 
 
 
C = 20 , D = 19, m = 11, and r = 13 
 
Thus, January 13, 2020 falls on a Monday.

Determine the day of the week on which August 12,1990 falls. 
Solution: 
 
Since February is the 6th month of 1990, so y=1990, hence, 
 
 
C = 19 , D = 90, m = 6, and r = 12 
 
Thus, August 12, 1990 falls on a Monday. 
Determine the day of the week on which December 25, 2014 falls. 
Solution: 
 
Since December is the 10th month of 2014, so y=2014, hence, 
 
 
C = 20 , D = 14, m = 10, and r = 25 
 
Thus, Christmas of 2014 will be celebrated on a Thursday.

Learning Activity No. 3 
 
This activity may be given to students as a group exercise or homework. The activity’s 
instructions are presented below. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Divide the class into 12 groups. Each group will be assigned one (1) 
unique month of the year 2050 to work on that said month’s schedule or 
calendar, again by using the algorithm for the perpetual calendar.  
 
Once done and asked to submit, all the 12 by-month calendar will be 
compiled and will be a project of the class. The class must still check whether 
each group’s work is accurate and correct, that is, all the months are in sync 
with all the other months to have made a whole year round. 
Instructor’s Guide: 
 
You may provide a blank calendar sheet for each group to make the calendar 
organized and more presentable.
