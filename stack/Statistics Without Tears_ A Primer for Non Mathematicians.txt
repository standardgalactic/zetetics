Acknowledgements
This book
is dedicated to Professor Peter Moore of the London
Business School who gave me just
the kind of confidence
in
approaching
statistics
that
1 hope my book
will
give
to
its
readers.
I take this opportunity also of thanking my Open University
colleagues, Professor Brian Lewis, John Bibby, Gordon Burt and
Fred Lockwood - and Penguin's advisory editor, David Nelson -
for
their detailed and constructive comments on
earlier drafts
which helped me greatly
in preparing this
final version of the
book. Lastly,
I thank my secretary, Heida Darling, for producing
the immaculate typescript on which those comments were made.


Introduction
So here
is yet another introductory book about statistics. Who
needs
it? What makes me
believe
I can
lead students
into the
subject along paths that have not already been trodden
flat by
authors galore?
Perhaps
I can best
tell you how different this book
is going to
be by mentioning some of the possible titles
I considered for
it:
Statistics
Without
Calculations^
Statistics
for
the
Innumerate,
Statistics in Words and Pictures^ The Underlying Ideas oj Statistics^
and How to Think Statistically.
All of these say something about my attitudes and intended
approach. The
first two
titles recognize that many non-mathe-
maticians take (are made to take?) a course in statistics as part
of some
wider
program
of
studies.
Such
non-mathematical
students may be more than a little dismayed at the sight of pages
bristling with formulae, equations and calculations. As it happens,
many
statistics textbooks begin by promising
that *the reader
will need no more than the ability to add, subtract, multiply and
divide, and to substitute numbers for
letters
in formulae.' But
most soon go on to lose him (or her) in calculations so involved
and time-consuming that the student forgets about the concepts
that the calculations are supposed to illustrate. He can't see the
statistical wood for the computational trees.
The third
title expresses how
I intend
to teach the essentials
of statistics without computation - by relying on the power of
words and
pictures. The
last two
titles indicate where
I believe
the emphasis should
lie in an introductory text - not on calcula-
tions but on ideas. This book does not teach you how to chew up
numbers and
spit out
plausible 'answers'
(a pocket calculator
could do this for you), but how to understand the key concepts of
9

10
Introduction
statistics and use them
in
thinking statistically about whatever
real-world
problems you
find them relevant
to.
If you are a
'consumer'
of
statistics
(interpreting
other
people's
research
reports, for instance), this may be all you need.
If, however, you
are a 'producer' of statistics, there are plenty of books to show
you how
to perform
all
the
necessary
calculations. And you
should find the learning of such computational procedures much
more meaningful after having first acquired a conceptual picture
of statistics as a whole. For such readers, this book will serve as a
useful primer, and that
is the idea
1 have embodied in my sub-
title.
But as you can see,
I ended up with the main title of Statistics
Without
Tears, from which you may infer
that
1 hope
to save
you from the weeping (and/or wailing and/or gnashing of teeth)
that
is so often to be heard among students drawn willy-nilly into
the study of statistics. But - be warned - 1 do not imply Statistics
Without
Eff'ort. As you'll
see,
1 expect you
to work for your
understanding!
How to use this book
You will soon notice (if you haven't already) that this book does
not present you with the usual stream of continuous text. Instead
of offering thousands of words for you to 'read, learn and
in-
wardly digest' as best you can, every now and again
I pause to
ask you a question. This questioning approach
is meant to make
the book less like a lecture than a 'tutorial in print' - a technique
used
with
considerable
success
in
the
correspondence
texts
produced by
Britain's Open
University, and
in some modern
textbooks.
The questions I ask will not, of course, require you to perform
calculations. (The nearest you will normally come to that is when
1 ask you to judge whether something we have discussed is likely
to be bigger or smaller than, or about the same size as, something
else.)
Rather, my questions
will
require you
to recognize ex-
amples of the concepts we are discussing, to distinguish between

Introduction
1
examples and non-examples of a given concept,
to
relate one
concept to another, to apply the concepts to practical problems,
to
predict
likely outcomes,
to
interpret
results, and so on.
In
short, my questions will be asking you not just to read, but also
to think about the subject.
So, every now and again, whenever we have got to a point
worth emphasizing, you
will
see a row of asterisks across the
page, like the one a few lines below. And just before you get to
that row of asterisks you will find
I have posed a question of some
kind. Here
is a question now (a
* multiple-choice' question, this
one) to get you into the spirit of the thing.
Judging by what
I have just said, what do you think will be
my main purpose in asking you questions? Is it:
(a)
to slow up your reading? or
(b) to help you learn? or
(c)
to test what you have learned?
*
:K
4e
*
III
Immediately after the row of asterisks, you will read my comments
on possible answers to the question, before we continue with the
discussion. So, as far as the question above is concerned, (b) is the
answer
I hope you'll have chosen. However,
it
is also true that
my questions will slow you up, because they will require you to
think as well as to read; in some cases, they will also enable you
to
test what you
have
learned
so
far.
However,
their
main
purpose
is to ensure that you do learn - by using the ideas we
discuss.
So the row of asterisks
is meant to act as a visual signal
re-
minding you of this message: please pause here, do not
READ ON UNTIL YOU HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTION.
Usually, the questions will require only a few seconds' thought,
and you will rarely need to write anything down. But do please
try to answer each one before going on to read my discussion of
it. If you were to skip the questions, you would get through the
book a lot faster, but you wouldn't have learned much. In fact, it is
quite a good idea to guard against even accidentally seeing my
discussion of an answer before trying the question. You may like

12
Introduction
to keep a sheet of paper handy with which to cover the text
below the next row of asterisks, until you are ready to read
it.
Four more points about reading this book, before you begin:
(1 ) The subject-matter is largely sequential. That is to say, the ideas
in Chapter 2 build on those in Chapter
1
; Chapter 3 depends on
Chapter 2; Chapter 4 cannot be understood unless you under-
stand the concepts
in Chapter
3, and so on. So please read the
chapters in the order in which I have set them out, and do not
skip any.
(2) Because this sequential style of argument may be rather new to
you (especially
if your main interest
lies on the arts-side or in a
social
science), you may find
it
useful, occasionally, to review
some earlier chapters before starting on a new one. You should
be helped
in this by my use of sub-headings for sections within
chapters. In each chapter I have also signalled the introduction of
important new concepts by
printing
their names
in capital
LETTERS.
(3) Even within a chapter, you
will sometimes find
it
helpful
(indeed essential)
to read a section or paragraph several times.
Don't be alarmed if you do this often. Many of the ideas in this
book are very
difficult to grasp without repeated reading (and
reflection).
(4) For maximum eff'ect, discuss the statistical ideas you meet in
this
book
with
tutors and
fellow
students,
or
with anyone
knowledgeable about the subject. And keep your eyes open for
occasions when you can put the ideas to practical use.

1. Statistical inquiry
Let me begin by assuring you that the kind of thinking involved
in statistics will not be entirely new to you. Indeed, you will find
that many of your day-to-day assumptions and decisions already
depend on
it.
Take a simple example: suppose
I
tell you
that two adult
friends of mine happen to be sitting
in the next room while
I
write. One
is five feet tall and the other is just under six feet tall.
What would be your best guess as to each one's sex, based on
that information alone?
:ic
:ie
:ie
:ie
>|e
4e
i|e
I expect you felt fairly confident in assuming that my friend five
feet
tall was female while
the
near-six-footer was
male. You
could have been wrong, of course, but experience tells you that
five-foot men and six-foot women are somewhat rare. You have
noticed
that, by and
large, men tend to be taller than women.
Of course, you have not seen
all men, or
all women, and you
recognize that many women are
taller than many men; never-
theless you feel reasonably confident about generalizing from the
particular men and women you have known to men and women
as a whole. That
is, in the absence of any other information^ you
would think
it more likely that a tall adult
is male and a small
adult
is female.
The above is a simple, everyday example of statistical thinking.
I could quote many more. Any time you use phrases
like: *On
average,
I cycle about 100 miles a week* or *We can expect a lot
of rain at this time of year' or The earlier you start reviewing,
the better you are likely to do in the exam,' you are making a
statistical statement, even though you may have performed no
13

14
Statistical inquiry
calculations. In the first example, past experience
is being sum-
marized in a rough-and-ready way. In the second and third cases,
the speaker
is generalizing from
his previous experience - of
how weather varies with the calendar or how exam success
is
related to study
tactics -
in order to make a prediction for a
particular year or a particular student.
Making sense of experience
It
is by making sense of our experience that we human beings
grow wiser and gain greater control over the environment we
live in. This has been true for the development of the human race
over the centuries.
It
is equally true for each of us as individuals
in our own
lifetimes.
Fortunately, we have
this capacity
for
noticing
things. We observe
people,
things and events
in
the
world around
us. We
notice
their
similarities and
differences,
their patterns and
regularities - especially when such
features
could endanger us or, alternatively, be turned to our advantage.
Many of our observations involve us in counting and measur-
ing. Perhaps we do so in rough-and-ready fashion, and often so
intuitively that we are scarcely aware of this habit of 'quantifica-
tion.' Nevertheless our observations and comparisons are often
in terms of 'how much?', 'how big?', 'how often?', 'how far?',
*how difficult?', 'how quickly?', 'how well?', and so on.
Sometimes our observations concern a single thing or person
or event. For example, we may notice the size of the potato-crop
in a particular field this year. We may make several observations
about the same thing: not only the size of the crop in this field but
also how much
fertilizer was used, the nature of the
soil, how
much sunshine and rain
it had, etc. Sometimes our observations
concern several similar but different things. For example, we may
observe the size of the potato-crop in several different fields this
year, or in the same field over a succession of years.
Thus, we may make one or more observations on one indi-
vidual, or we may do so for several individuals. Soon we have a
collection of observations (or 'data. Mo use the technical jargon).

Making sense of experience
15
Inquisitively, as
if by instinct, we start looking for connections
and patterns,
similarities and differences, among the things we
happen to have noticed. We ask ourselves questions about the
data.
For example, what
questions might we ask
in
looking
for
connections among the data we have collected about the size of
potato-crops?
4e
*
4(
Â«
i|c
9it
We might ask:
is the size of the crop similar
in
all
fields
this
year? Or,
is
it similar in this field from one year to another? If
not, why not ? What else
is different about those fields, or years,
that might explain the differences?
All such questions lead to an even more vital one: what can
we learn from the connections we see among this collection of
data that might help us act more effectively in the future?
This
is where statistics comes
in.
It has been developed as a
way
of making
sense of collections of observations.
It
aims,
particularly, to help us avoid jumping to conclusions and to be
cautious about the extent to which we can generalize from our
always limited experience.
The tendency to generalize is an essential part of our everyday
thinking.
Because
this
particular
field was generously
treated
with a certain fertilizer and gave a bigger than usual potato-crop,
we may
feel
inclined to generalize and suggest
that,
therefore,
other fields so treated would give bigger than usual potato-crops.
Would you think
it safe to generalize in this way - on the basis
of experience with one field ? Why, or why not ?
4c

Â«

He

In fact, such a generalization would be rather dangerous -
it
is
very likely to be wrong. The bigger crop may be due not to the
fertilizer but to, say, the weather. (That
is, we may have jumped
to an incorrect conclusion.) So even the same field, treated in the
same way with fertilizer, may give a very different yield in another
year. And as for the other fields,
they may
differ
in yet other
ways that could influence the potato-yield, e.g. type of soil, crop

Statistical inquiry
grown
in
the
previous
year,
prevalence
of
plant-disease
in
neighboring
fields,
and
so
on. (Hence
the weakness
in our
generalization.)
So, what
is true of one field in one year may not be true of the
same field in other years,
let alone ot other fields. If we want to
generalize more confidently, we need more experience - more
observations. The more
fields we look
at, and over more and
more years, the more confident we can be in suggesting how the
potato-crop
is likely to turn out in other, similar fields.
But notice the word
* likely
' in the sentence above.
' Likelihood'
or
* weighing up the chances' (that is, probability) is central to
the statistical view of the world.
It recognizes no 100% certain-
ties,
especially
when
dealing
with
individual
people,
things
or events. For example, a particular kind of field may, in general,
produce a
bigger potato-crop
if treated
in a certain way,
but
there will be many exceptions.
In which of these two cases would you think me more likely
to be proved correct:
(a)
if
I
predict
that
fields of a
certain
type
will,
in
general,
produce a bigger crop
if treated in such-and-such a way? or
(b)
if I predict that any such particular field you care to pick out
will do so?
:ie
i|e
4e
4e
%
:)(
:ic
I'd be more likely to be correct in (a) than in (b). While such fields
in general (maybe nine out of ten of them)
will behave as ex-
pected,
I can't be sure that any one particular field you happen to
choose will be one of those that do.
As you
will
learn,
statistics
helps
us
to
look
for
reliable
regularities and associations among things 'in general' and *in
the long run .' At the same time, however,
it teaches us proper
caution
in expecting these to hold true of any particular
indi-
viduals. The two chief concerns of statistics are with (1) sum-
marizing
our
experience
so
that we
and
other
people
can
understand
its essential features, and (2) using the summary to
make estimates or predictions about what
is likely to be the case
in other (perhaps future) situations. In this book we'll be looking

What is statistics ?
17
at statistical concepts that enable us to summarize and predict
more precisely than we normally would in everyday conversation.
What is statistics?
Before we go any further, we'd better take note, in passing, that
the word
* statistics'
is used in at least four different senses. First
of all,
it can indicate, very broadly, a whole subject or discipline,
and everything that gets studied or practiced in its name. Sec-
ondly,
and more
specifically,
the
term may
refer
to
the
methods used to
collect or process or interpret
quantitative
data. Thirdly, the term may be applied to collections of data
gathered by
those methods. And
fourthly,
it may
refer
to
certain
specially
calculated
figures
(e.g.
an
average)
that
somehow
characterize
such
a
collection
of
data.
Thus,
to
illustrate the four meanings
in turn, a researcher in a firm's
statistics department may use
statistics
(statistical methods)
to gather and
interpret
statistics
(data)
about
the revenue
from sales of a new detergent, and may summarize his find-
ings by quoting the statistics of 'average sales per thousand of
population' in various towns and 'range of sales revenue from
town to town.'
The meaning
T shall emphasize in this book
is the second of
those mentioned above: statistics as a set of methods of inquiry.
It
is these methods that enable us to think statistically - a very
powerful way to think - about a variety of situations that involve
measurements or observations of quantities.
Statistical thinking (of one kind or another) has a long history.
From earliest times, kings and governments have been collecting
stat(e)istics about the population and resources of their states.
The Domesday Book compiled for William the Conqueror
is a
comparatively recent example. Even the Old Testament mentions
rulers, like the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, who had a keen interest
in data about how many people they had
available
to
build
pyramids
or
fight
wars,
and how much
wealth
they
could
conceivably squeeze out
of them
in
taxation. Today, govern-
ments are the most prolific generators of statistics (in the sense of

18
Statistical inquiry
collections of data)
: on cost of living, unemployment, indus-
trial production, birth-rates, imports and exports, etc. (See the
Statistical Abstracts
of
the
United
States,
several hundred
pages of data produced by the government, or the equivalent
publications in most other industrialized countries.)
Gamblers,
too, have made an
indispensable contribution to
statistical thinking. To them, and their desire to 'figure out the
odds' in games of chance, we owe the theory of probability. Such
theory only began to develop in the seventeenth century, largely
due to the interest aroused in the French mathematician, Blaise
Pascal, by (so
it
is said) the problems posed by a dice-playing
friend. The gambling
table proved
a good
test-ground
for a
theory concerned with
prediction, but
probability theory soon
began to reveal
its explanatory and predictive powers in areas like
astronomy, heredity and genetics, business, and even warfare. *
Today, few professional activities are untouched by statistical
thinking, and most academic disciplines use
it to a greater or
lesser degree. Its applications in science, especially the 'biological
sciences'
like
genetics,
medicine
and
psychology,
are
both
numerous
and
well
known.
But
the
physical
sciences
(e.g.
meteorology,
engineering
and
physics)
also
need
statistical
methods. And even
in
the
humanities,
the dating of ancient
fragments of textile or pottery has been revolutionized by the
essentially
statistical
technique
of radio-carbon
dating;
while
statistical methods have also been used in literary studies to help
decide such questions as whether a
particular author wrote a
certain work, or
at what
point
in
his
lifetime
it was
written.
Statistics has developed out of an aspect of our everyday thinking
to become a ubiquitous tool of systematic research.
But
it
is time we got down
to
discussing what
it
is about
statistical thinking that can lend
itself to such a variety of pur-
suits.
Statistics arises out of caution
in the face of uncertainty.
Statistical thinking is a way of recognizing that our observations
of the world can never be totally accurate; they are always some-
what uncertain. For instance, a child we record as being four feet
* See How to Take a Chance by Darrell Huff (Norton,
1964).

Descriptive and inferential statistics
19
in height
will not be exactly that - somewhere between
3
feet
Hi inches and 4 feet i inch maybe, but not exactly four feet. And
the chance of inaccuracy
is even greater
if we use our present
observations
to
estimate
what
observations
elsewhere
might
reveal. Thus, we might want to use our knowledge that four feet is
the average height
in
this
child's
class
to
predict
the average
height in another class.
In such matters there can be no certainty. But statistics enables
us to estimate the extent of our errors. Thus, we may express
near certainty that the child's height
lies within a range of four
feet plus or minus half an
inch; or we may calculate that the
chances are ninety-nine
in a hundred that the average height in
another class lies within two inches of four feet.
Descriptive and inferential statistics
You will find that statistics textbooks commonly make a distinc-
tion between
(1) descriptive statistics (methods used to
summarize or describe our observations), and (2) inferential
STATISTICS
(using
those observations
as a
basis
for making
estimates or predictions,
i.e. inferences about a situation that has
not yet been observed).
Look again at those three
* everyday' statements
I mentioned
earlier. Which of them appear(s)
* descriptive' and which
* in-
ferential,' in the sense indicated above?
(i)
'On average, I cycle about 100 miles a week';
(ii)
'We can expect a lot of rain at this time of year';
(iii) 'The earlier you start reviewing, the better you are likely
to do in the exam.'
Â«
4e
9K
Statement (i) is descriptive (an attempt to summarize experience),
while (ii) and (iii) go beyond what has been observed, in order to
make inferences about what
is likely to happen in the future.
The distinction between
descriptive and
inferential
statistics
depends upon
another:
the
distinction
between
samples and
populations.

20
Statistical inquiry
In
statistical
jargon,
'population'
does
not
necessarily
refer to a body of people.
It may refer to people, but
it may
equally well refer to white mice, to light-bulbs of a particular
brand, to substandard dwellings in inner cities, to meteorites,
to future examination
results
in secondary
schools, and
so
on. The point is that population refers to all the cases or situations
that the
* statistician' wants his inferences or guesses or estimates
to apply to. Thus, different statisticians may be making inferences
about the learning ability of (all) white mice; predicting how long
all light-bulbs of a particular type are likely to burn; estimating
the cost of renovating (all) substandard dwellings; predicting the
composition of (all) meteorites; guessing the (total) numbers of
candidates passing various examinations, and so on.
Perhaps it is also worth pointing out that the researcher will not
be interested in every aspect of members of a population. Rather,
he
is interested
in just some - maybe only one - of the many
attributes or characteristics that members might have in common.
Thus a psychologist may not be concerned to speculate about the
tail-length or litter-size of white mice (though these characteristics
might interest other researchers); he
is interested simply in their
learning ability. Neither might the astrophysicist be interested in
predicting
the geographical
distribution
or
the
size of
falling
meteorites as well as their composition.
However, even
if he
is interested in only one characteristic of
his population, the researcher will be most unlikely to study all
members of
it.
Usually he has to do the
best he can with a
SAMPLE - a relatively small selection - from within the popula-
tion. Often he must do this to save time and expense. For the
astrophysicist to tour the world inspecting every meteorite that
has ever been known to
fall would be prohibitively expensive.
Again, an
industrial researcher who
is estimating the burning-
life of a brand of light-bulb by
* testing to destruction' cannot
test all the population or there will be none left to sell.
In some
cases,
it may
be
logically
impossible
to study
all
members of the population. The population may be
infinite, or
simply not yet available for study. Thus, the psychologist who
is
studying learning ability in white mice will hope his results, and

Descriptive and inferential statistics
21
therefore his inferences, will have some application to
all white
mice - not just the millions that exist at
this moment
but also
the further millions not yet born. He may even hope his results
can
be
generalized
to
explain human
learning.
Likewise,
the
astro-physicist may well use
his
statistics to generalize not just
about the meteorites that have already fallen to earth, or even
about those that
will
fall
in the future; he may hope to specu-
late also about the composition of other objects flying around
in space.
All such researchers go beyond the available information. They
generalize from a sample to the population, from the seen to the
unseen. (So do we
all, though
often
in a rather careless,
un-
controlled way, when using everyday 'common sense.') This idea
of generalizing from a sample applies to research
in the arts as
well as in the sciences. For example, one would not need to have
read
everything
ever
written
by,
say,
D.
H.
Lawrence
and
Joseph Conrad before one could begin generalizing about how
they compared and contrasted as novelists. One could work from
a sample of two or three books by each author.
Anyway, descriptive statistics
is concerned with summarizing
or describing a sample.
Inferential statistics
is concerned with
generalizing from a sample,
to make estimates and
inferences
about a wider population. Consider a
biologist experimenting
with
the feeding of chicks. He may
report
(using
descriptive
statistics) that a particular sample of 60 chicks, fed a particular
compound, grow
faster
than
a
similar sample
fed on some
standard diet. So much (the weight gain) he reports as a fact. But
he goes beyond the fact. He uses inferential statistics to suggest
that all similar chicks (the wider population) would grow faster if
given similar treatment.
How safe are such generalizations from a part to the whole?
Well, that
is
largely what
statistics
is
about:
quantifying
the
probability of error. We will be looking at the underlying ideas in
subsequent chapters. One thing we can say at this stage, however:
the reliability of the generalization will depend on how well the
sample mirrors the population. Is the sample truly representative
of the population?

22
Statistical inquiry
For example,
suppose you
read
that an
educational
re-
searcher has established that a group of 12-year-old American
boys learned appreciably more French when taught by 'con-
versation' than did an otherwise similar group who learned
from a textbook. The researcher,
like
all researchers,
is not
interested simply in the language acquisition of the particular
boys in his sample. He wants to generalize from
it to suggest
how other people
(his wider population)
might
best
learn
French.
For
which
of
the
following
possible
populations
would you think
it most reasonable to suggest that the 'con-
versational' method might be as effective as with the sample,
and for which of them would you think
it least reasonable to
suggest this:
(i)
all 12-year-old American children;
(ii)
all 12-year-old American boys;
(iii) all 12-year-old boys;
(iv)
all boys; or
(v)
all learners?
:|e

What I was really asking there was: *Of which population was the
sample likely to be most/least representative?' So, the superiority
of the conversational method that was found in the sample would
be most
likely
to
be
true of population
(ii),
all
12-year-old
American
boys.
But
there would
still be
a
big margin
of
doubt: how typical was the sample of
all
12-year-old boys?
Did the boys in the sample, for instance, cover the same cross-
section of natural
ability, interest
in languages, previous ex-
perience,
etc.,
as would
be
found
in
the
population
as
a
whole? Clearly, attempts to generalize to populations less and
less
like
the sample would be more and more doomed
to
error. Girls may not learn in the same way as boys. Children
of other nationalities may not learn as American children do.
Adult learners may need different approaches from those of
children. Hence, what
is true of the sample
is least likely to
be true of population (v), all learners.
Over-generalizing
is common enough
in everyday conversa-

Collecting a sample
23
tion. But
it
is sometimes found
in
* scientific' discourse also. A
researcher may have
failed to notice that the members of his
sample
differed
in some important
respect from
those of the
population he was hoping to generalize to. For example, during
the Second World War, gunners
in R.A.F. bombers returning
from
raids were asked from which
direction
they were most
frequently attacked by enemy fighters. The majority answer was
'from above and behind.' Why might
it have been unwise to
assume, supposing you were a gunner, that this would be true
of attacks on R.A.F. bombers in general? (Think of the wider
population from which that sample of gunners came.)
4c
:ic
4c
*
*
*
This was not an easy
question. However,
the
risk of a
false
generalization
lay
in
the
fact
that
the researcher was
able
to
interview only
the survivors of attacks.
It could
well
be
that
attacks from below and behind were no less frequent, but did not
get represented in the sample because (from the enemy's point of
view) they were successful.
Collecting a sample
The problem here has been called the 'paradox of sampling.' A
sample is misleading unless
it
is representative of the population;
but how can we
tell
it
is representative unless we already know
what we need to know about the population, and therefore have
no need of samples! The paradox cannot be completely resolved;
some
uncertainty
must
remain.
Nevertheless,
our
statistical
methodology enables us to collect samples that are
likely to be
as representative as possible. This allows us to exercise proper
caution and avoid over-generalization.
In some
statistical
inquiries,
the
sample
'chooses
itself.'
(Some writers prefer
to use the term
'batch'
for such sam-
ples.) Suppose, for instance, that a family doctor wants to do
some research on the frequency with which various ailments
occur among the patients who happen to visit his office over

24
Statistical inquiry
a period of time.
Since
his sample members choose them-
selves, he will have to be very careful if he wishes to general-
ize to any wider population. Certainly he can't assume that the
varieties of ailment found among his sample
will be typical
of people in general living in his area. He might be somewhat
safer in inferring that they are similar to those presented to
other local doctors. He would be much less safe in assuming
that doctors in quite different areas would have to deal with
the same ailments in the same proportions. In short, he must
say to himself:
'I have some interesting data about a sample:
but is there a wider population
I can generalize to?'
In other
inquiries, however, the researcher starts off with a
population in mind. He then selects a sample that he believes will
represent
it. In order for
it to be representative, members for the
sample must be chosen at random from the population. That
is,
each member of the population should have an equal chance of
being chosen for the sample. This
is not always easy to achieve.
For example, if you go into a busy street to interview a
* random'
sample of passers-by about, say, their political opinions, you are
unlikely to be successful. Why? Because you are most likely to
approach people who look approachable and are obviously not
in a great hurry to be somewhere
else. Such people may well
differ in their political opinions from people who look surly or
bad-tempered, or who are
in a hurry. Thus you
will have
in-
troduced an imbalance or bias into your sample.
It will not be
random.
To avoid
bias,
it
is preferable to use mechanical methods of
selecting a random sample. For instance, we may give each item
in the population a number, and then refer to what is called a table
of random numbers. This table will give us as many numbers
as we want - a random selection - say 04, 34, 81, 85, 94, 45,
19, 38, 73, 46,
if we want a sample of ten. We then pick out
those members of the population
that have those numbers.
This type of sampling can be done effectively through using a
computer, especially when large numbers are involved.
If you have neither a computer nor tables of random numbers,
all you can do
is use the
* raffle' principle. If your population
is
small enough, put a marker bearing the name or number of each

Collecting a sample
25
member into a box, shake them up, and then draw out at random
(for instance, blindfold) enough markers to make up your sample.
Achieving randomness in our street interviews might be rather
more difficult. After all, we don't know who's going to be around,
and we can't give them numbers in advance. Can you see any way
of making the selection mechanical ?
4e *****
*
The sort of thing one might do
is to stand near a comer and
decide to accost, say, the fifth person to come round the corner
after you have concluded the previous interview. Alternatively,
you might
decide
to
interview
the
first
person
to round
the
corner after, say, one minute
has elapsed. Anyway, the
object
is to give every member of the population (people on the street
at that time of day) an equal chance of being chosen.
However,
it
is conceivable that you could use random methods
and
still end up with a biased sample. That
is, the sample could,
by accident,
still turn out to be unrepresentative of the popula-
tion you hoped to generalize to. For example, suppose you are
trying to determine students' attitudes to the food provided in a
certain college. There are 1,000 students in the college (600 men
and 400 women). You decide to take a sample of 100 and you
select
it from the college
roll by using random numbers.
Is
it
possible that the sample could consist entirely of men or entirely
of women?
*******
Yes, of course it's possible that the sample could consist entirely
of men or entirely of women. After
all, there are 600 men and
400 women, and you're taking only 100 students. Similarly, the
sample could consist entirely of students from one year. Such
samples would be extremely unlikely, of course. But
it
is almost
certain that the sample would be unbalanced to some extent - that
is to say, we could hardly expect the sample of 100 students to
contain exactly 60 men and 40 women, or to reflect exactly the
proportions
between
first-year,
second-year
and
third-year
students. This may or may not matter. There may be no reason

26
Statistical inquiry
to suspect that, say, men and women students will differ any more
in their opinions about the food than would blue-eyed students
and green-eyed students. But if there is a systematic difference in
opinion between students in different categories then the sample is
biased. We'll not be able to generalize from
its overall opinions
to those of the population. Instead, we'll have to generalize from
women in the sample to women in the population, and from men
to men, and so on.
In such
cases,
it
will be preferable to use what
is called a
STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLE. That
is, we have realized
in
advance that different groups within the population (e.g. different
sexes,
different age-groups,
different
income-levels) may
differ
also
in
the characteristic we are
interested
in. So we
state
in
advance the number of men and women,
adults and children,
rich and poor,
that we need
in our sample. We then choose
randomly from within those groups (or strata) in the population.
Let's end
this chapter with a dramatic example of bias
in a
sample. The sample was one gathered by doctors at a Canadian
hospital
some
years
ago,
and
consisted
of
several
hundred
patients on whom the newly-introduced diphtheria vaccine was
tried out. At the same time, a 'control group' of patients was
treated, not with the vaccine but with the methods commonly
used up to that period. Over several years of trials,
it was found
that 16% of the vaccinated patients died, while only 8% of the
patients treated in the normal way died. The generalization might
seem crystal clear: patients are less likely to survive
if you give
them the vaccine. And yet that same diphtheria vaccine
is used
today as a routine preventive measure. Why? The answer
lies
in a bias built into the samples. Can you imagine what
it might
be?
9ie

Â«
4c

*
Well, the fact of the matter is that neither the vaccine sample nor
the control group truly represented the population of patients
on whom the vaccine
is now regularly used. No doubt for the
most professional of reasons, the doctors had been administering
the vaccine only to patients who were very seriously ill; while the

traditional
treatment
was
reserved
for
patients
with
milder
symptoms.
Thus,
the two
samples
were
biased,
in
different
directions, and
neither truly represented the population of all
patients.
The possibility of chance bias within a sample is one we'll have
to consider again later in this book, when we think further about
generalizing from samples to population. Meanwhile,
let's look,
in Chapter 2, at the terms in which we might describe what we
see in a sample.

2. Describing our sample
What do we do with the members of a sample, once we've got
them ? As far as statistics
is concerned, whatever else we do with
them, we are going to produce a set oj numbers related to which-
ever of their common characteristics we are interested
in. This
set of numbers may,
for
instance,
indicate the proportions of
married, single, widowed or divorced people among the sample;
alternatively,
it may indicate their ages or their incomes.
If the
members of our sample are people, an outraged humanist might
suggest that we are reducing them to numbers. In fact,
it would
be bad statistics as well as bad ethics
if we allowed ourselves to
forget that there
is much, much more to the members of such a
sample than we have been able to capture in numbers - and it may
bear crucially on how we are to interpret our results.
Statistical variables
Samples are made up of individuals. The individuals in a parti-
cular sample may be humans, rodents, light-bulbs, months of the
year, potato-fields, or whatever. All members of the sample will
share some common attribute or characteristic we are interested
in: color, sex, weight, price, durability,
etc.
Furthermore, each
individual member of the sample will differ from one or more of
the others on this characteristic: some will be one color,
some
another; some will be male, others female; some will be lighter,
others heavier; etc.
So,
in looking at the members of a sample, we ask how they
vary among themselves on one (or more) of such characteristics.
Because of the variation among individuals, such characteristics
are
called
variable
characteristics
or,
simply, variables. A
28

Statistical variables
29
variable in statistics, then,
is any attribute or characteristic that
will enable us to distinguish between one individual and another.
For instance, suppose you are thinking of buying a second-hand
bicycle. Can you
list some variables that you might consider in
distinguishing between
the
various
bicycles
that would
be
offered for sale?
*
*
*
*
Uti
Below, you'll see the variables that I'd be interested in. Your list
may include some, or all, of these, and some others:
Make of bicycle (e.g. Raleigh, Falcon, Puch, Fuji, etc.)
Type of bicycle (e.g. racer, tourer, roadster, etc.)
Color
Age
Condition (e.g. Excellent, Acceptable, Poor)
Price
Size of frame
Number of gears
On each of these characteristics, each bicycle could be expected
to
differ from
at
least one of the
others. They
are
variable
characteristics. ('Number of wheels' would not be a variable,
because we would not expect to see a
bicycle offered for sale
with other than two wheels. Variation here
is ruled out.)
The question now
is: how do we evaluate each
individual
bicycle, in the sample available to us, in terms of these variables?
This depends on the type of variable.
With a variable like 'Make of bicycle,' we set up categories,
e.g. Raleigh, Falcon, Puch, Fuji, etc. Then we classify or cate-
gorize each bicycle simply by noting its name. In this book,
I'll
be
using
the
term category-variable
to
refer
to
any
variable that involves putting individuals into categories. In fact,
a
category-variable
like *Make
of
bicycle'
is
often
called a
'nominal variable' (Latin nominalis = of a name), because
we are giving names to the different forms the variable may take.
Which of the variables in the
list above would you say are
category-variables ?

30
Describing our sample
Certainly, 'Type of bicycle' and
* Color'
are category-variables.
In both cases, we inspect the bicycle concerned and decide which
of two or more categories
it belongs in. (These are also nominal
variables.)
But you may also have considered
' Cond ition ' to be a category-
variable. So
it
is. Three categories of condition are mentioned
above:
Excellent, Acceptable, Poor. This
is a different kind of
category-variable, however. The categories here imply that each
individual bicycle can be judged as better or worse than others.
Whenever we can say a sample member
is better, or bigger, or
faster, or
in any way has more of a certain characteristic than
does another, then we can arrange them in order. Thus, Excellent-
Acceptable-Poor
are
ordered
categories,
and
this
kind
of
category-variable
is
therefore
often
called
an
'ordinal
VARIABLE.'
Suppose
just
ten
bicycles are available to us at present. We
decide to judge them on 'Relative condition', and we rank them
from
1st (the bicycle in best condition) down to 10th (the bicycle
in worst condition). Here we have set up ten categories, and we'll
have one member of the sample in each. What kind of category-
variable is this? Is
it (a) nominal or (b) ordinal?
'Relative condition'
is an ordinal variable. We have to arrange
the sample members
in
order, according to how much of the
characteristic we judge each to
have. Only then can we
label
them with the rank numbers:
1st, 2nd, 3rd
.
.
. 9th,
10th.
But notice here an important difference between splitting the
bicycles into three ordered categories and ranking them in order
from
1st to
10th. Which method would demand we inspect the
bicycles more closely? And which method
gives greater
infor-
mation about the individual differences among the bicycles?
4c
:|c
4c
4(
The method demanding closer inspection, and giving greater in-
formation about
the
differences,
is
that of ranking. With the
three ordered categories we might,
for example, have lumped

Statistical variables
3
five or
six
bicycles together as
* acceptable.' But with ranking
we'd have to find sufficient difference between those five or six
bicycles
to be able to
sort them
out
into
five or
six ordered
categories (the middle-rank positions).
Before
I go on to talk about the other main type of variable Vd
like you
to
be
familiar
with,
let's
just
notice how numbers
have been used
in ranking.
In
fact, they were used simply
as
labels:
first, second,
third, fourth,
etc. We can't do arithmetic
with these numbers.
Would you, for example, assume that the bicycle ranked 4th
was twice as bad as the bicycle ranked 2nd? Would you assume
that the difference in condition between bicycles
1 and 2
is equal
to that between 3 and 4?
*
sic
:ic
He
*
He
Well, I hope you didn't try to make any such assumptions. There
are no grounds for them. The numbers are attached simply to
show the order - not to show how much better each
is compared
with others. (Really,
this
is rather like a race
in which, for ex-
ample, the first two runners finish almost together; then there is a
gap of a second or two before the third, fourth and fifth cross the
line; then the rest of the runners finish with varying intervals of
time between them.)
In the second main type of variable I want you to know about,
however, numbers are used
in quite a different fashion. In
fact,
with
this kind of variable,
individual sample members can be
described only
in terms of numbers. This means that when we
look at an individual to see how he, she or
it differs from others
on this characteristic, what we are looking for
is a quantity that
can be counted or measured. In the case of our bicycles, one such
variable would be
* Number of gears.'
Here we look at each bicycle and ask
: how many ? One ? Three ?
Four? Here the numbers are not simply
labels. A
bicycle with
six gears has twice
as many
as one with
three.
If
I buy one
bicycle with five gears and another with ten gears, my two bicycles
will have fifteen gears between them. These are numbers (quanti-
ties) that you can do arithmetic with.

32
Describing our sample
Look again
at the variables
listed on page
29. Which ones
are of this
latest type - where the differences between sample
members will be expressed as quantities?
4e
4c
4c
*
Â«
*
The other variables on which bicycles will differ in quantity are:
Age, Price, Size of frame. Just as we asked how many gears a
bicycle has, so we can ask how old
it
is; we can ask
its price;
and we can measure
its frame size. All such variables - where
what we are looking for is a numerical value, a quantity - we'll
call QUANTITY-VARIABLES.
As with category-variables,
there
is more than one kind of
quantity-variable.
One
distinction
we
can
make
is
between
quantity-variables that do and those that do not use a scale of
numbers on which the zero-point means that the characteristic
does
not
exist
at
all.
Most
quantity-variables
(e.g.
income)
do have such a zero-point. If someone's income is $0, then he
earns nothing; he
is completely lacking
in income. Similarly,
this means that someone who earns $10 per day earns twice
as much as someone who earns $5 per day. But some quantity-
variables do
not have
this kind of zero-point - temperature,
for
instance. An
object with a temperature of 0Â°
is not com-
pletely
lacking
in
heat.
Consequently,
an
object whose tem-
perature
is 10Â°
is not twice as hot as one whose temperature
is
5Â°;
it
is simply 5Â° hotter. Many quantity-variables invented by
social
scientists,
e.g.
intelligence quotient and socio-economic
status, are of this latter type.
Another
distinction
is
between
quantity-variables
that
are
discrete and those that are continuous. A discrete variable
is one
in which the possible values are clearly separated from
one another. A classic example
is family size: a family can have
1 child, or 2,
3, 4, 5, etc. But
it cannot have 1\ or 4.75.
With continuous variables, on the other hand, whatever
two values you mention,
it
is always possible to imagine more
possible values
in between them. Height
is a good example. A
child may be 4 feet high this year and 4 feet 3 inches next year. In
the meantime, however, he will have been not just 4 feet
1 inch

Statistical variables
33
and 4
feet 2
inches, but an
infinite number of heights
in be-
tween: 4.0001
feet
.
.
. 4.00015 feet
.
.
. 4.0002 feet ... and so on.
How do we evaluate a sample member in terms of these two
types of quantity-variable?
Discrete
variables imply
counting,
but with continuous variables we need a measurement. Among
our bicycle variables, 'Price'
is discrete. Money is counted rather
than measured (except perhaps in banks where coins are some-
times weighed in bags). But the point
is this: you may be asked
for a
price,
say,
of $40 or
(for some
unlikely reason)
of
$40.01; but
there's no
possible price between these two,
or
between any other two that are 10 apart.
'Size of frame,' on
the other hand,
is continuous:
the frame may measure
21
inches or 21.1
inches, or an infinite number of possible sizes
in between.
Which of the other quantity-variables to do with bicycles (page
29)
is discrete and which continuous?
The only remaining discrete variable
is 'Number of gears.' If
we count the gears on a bicycle, we find
it has
1, 3, 4, 5, 8 or
10.
In-between values are not possible.
(This
is
rather an
unusual
discrete
variable,
in
that
its
possible
values
are
not
equally
spaced.)
'Age,' on the other hand,
is a continuous variable:
it
is measured along a scale that allows for an infinite number of
possible ages between, say, ten months and eleven months (or
any other two values)
Here
is a diagram to illustrate the main relationships between
types of variable:

Diff'erent variables produce data that have to be handled
dif-
ferently
in
statistics,
as
you'll soon
see. The main
distinction
you'll need to remember, however,
is between what I've called

34
Describing our sample
category-variables and quantity-variables. But before we move on,
it's worth
noticing
that data about
quantity-variables can be
converted into category data. For example, people under 5 feet
can be categorized as 'small,' those between 5 feet and 6 feet
as 'medium,' and those over 6 feet as
'tall.' Similarly, students
who have scored
less than 60%
in an examination may be
considered to have 'failed,' while those who got 60% or more
have 'passed.' The drawback to this sort of procedure, how-
ever,
is that LOSS of information occurs.
If the numbers in
categories only are recorded, we
lose data about the
actual
measured heights and the exact examination
scores. Such a
sacrifice may sometimes
be worth
while
in
the
interest
of
making
the
data
easier
to
handle.
However,
the
sacrifice
should not be made without weighing up the pros and cons.
j
Two other points of terminology are worth clearing up at this
j
point. First of all, some books use the word 'measurement'
in
connection with
all
variables - not just with quantity-variables
that are continuous. That
is to say, they regard categories as a
very
crude
form
of
measurement,
with
ordered
categories,
ranking,
discrete
quantity-variables and
continuous
quantity-
variables becoming increasingly less crude. Thus, you may often
come across the word 'values' (which one might think would be
used only
in connection with quantity-variables) being used to
refer to the various named categories of a category-variable.
Secondly, you'll find
I speak frequently of 'observations' or
'observed values.' By this,
I mean each measurement, or count or
classification, that
is made for each member of the sample. For
instance,
if we record the ages of a sample of 100 students, we'll
have 100 observations.
If we record each one's sex as well, we'll
have a total of 200 observations (or 200 'observed values,' if we
use the terminology just mentioned.)
The word 'observation' might sometimes be used even though
we had actually not seen the student's age or sex for ourselves
(for example, on a birth certificate). We might not even have seen
the student at all, but only his or her responses to a questionnaire.
In such cases,
it would really be preferable to talk of 'recorded
values (or data).'

Error, accuracy and approximations

Error, accuracy and approximations
In collecting data from a sample, which kind would you expect,
in general, to be more accurate!

example, how much gas they used in a previous week), and
give a 'guesstimate' instead; or, of course, they may choose to
record a deliberate lie (say, about their age or income).
However,
as
I
suggested
earlier, we cannot
expect
perfect
accuracy
in
statistical data. Even when we are doing our own
counting or measuring, some error
is
inevitable.
Lapses of
concentration or the necessity to work quickly can cause us to
put a sample-member in the wrong category, to count an item
twice, or to leave one out. Also, with measuring, the limitations
of our instruments (e.g. the markings on a ruler) mean that we
can never record, for example, the exact length, only the length
to the nearest inch, or tenth of an inch, etc. So, a room recorded
as being 10 feet long (to the nearest foot) may measure anything
between 9i feet and lOi feet in length. (A slightly smaller room
would have been recorded as 9
feet long and a slightly
larger
one as
1
1 feet long - to the nearest foot.) The value recorded may
be
in error by anything up to six inches either way. We could
indicate the possible error by stating
the room's length
as
10
feet Â± 6 inches: that
is, 'ten feet plus or minus six inches
.'
Could
the room have been measured
in such a way
as
to
produce a recorded value containing
(i) a possible error smaller
than Â± 6 inches, and/or (ii) no error at all ?

36
Describing our sample
If we'd used a smaller unit of measurement, measuring, say, to the
nearest inch, we'd have made the possible error smaller. Thus, if
we'd measured the room as being 9 feet 10 inches (to the nearest
inch), the true length could not
lie outside the range 9
feet 9^
inches to 9 feet 10^ inches. So the maximum possible error (the
difference between our recorded value and the true value) would
be half an inch. But, no matter how much we reduced the unit of
measurement (measuring, say, to the nearest tenth of an inch, or
to the nearest millimeter), we'd never reduce the possible error to
zero. The same goes for weighing, timing, or any other form of
measurement.
Experimental
scientists
use
great
ingenuity
in
devising more and more precise instruments with which to do
their measuring; yet, however sophisticated the instrument, even
they must concede
that, between
true value and observation,
some difference (perhaps infinitesimal) must remain.
Greater accuracy, even
if practicable
at
all,
will
usually be
more expensive -
in time,
if not
in money. And
it may not be
worth the bother. For example, if you were buying carpet for that
room we discussed a few moments ago, you'd no doubt need to
know
its length and width to the nearest inch; but
if you were
buying paint to decorate
its walls, a measurement to the nearest
foot (or even yard) would suffice. A more accurate measurement
could not affect the amount of paint you'd decide to buy.
Naturally,
the
size of the
possible
errors
differs from one
subject-area to another. In experimental science, they are likely
to be minute.
In the social
sciences, they are much
larger. In
business and economics, where so much data
is collected by
questionnaire, with very little check on the responses, errors can
be enormous. National figures concerning,
say, unemployment
in various towns, or output from various industries, may easily be
off by 10 to 15%. (This may be one of the reasons why gov-
ernment predictions of future population-sizes and inflation-
rates, for example, can turn out to be so very inaccurate.)
Whatever the subject-area,
it
is sensible to remember that the
observations
or
recorded
values
are
really
just approxima-
tions
to some
true
values.
If we've counted
carefully and
enjoyed good co-operation from our questionnaire respondents

Error, accuracy and approximations
37
(or
if we've measured
carefully with a small enough
unit of
measurement),
our
data
should
contain
minimal
error.
The
sample-figures
will
be accurate enough
for us to base sensible
decisions on them. But
if our counting or measuring has been
careless or crude, or if we have to rely on data that someone else
may (for all we know) have collected carelessly or crudely, then
the error may be large and we can't be so confident about inter-
preting
them.
Furthermore,
despite a common
belief
to
the
contrary, statistics cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
Once they've been collected and recorded,
well or poorly, no
amount of statistical manipulation can improve on the accuracy
of our data.
In Chapter
3, we'll go on to consider what can be done with
our sample data, once we've got
it.

3. Summarizing our data
When we have finished collecting our data from a sample, we may
have pages covered with figures. (These are our 'observations.')
Our first problem
is to sort them out and summarize them, so
that both we and other people will be able to make sense of them.
Tables and diagrams
I expect you have had enough of those second-hand
bicycles
in the previous chapter, so let's change the subject.* Suppose a
college in a large town has been collecting data from a sample of
50 students, covering many variables relating to student health
and social and academic activities.
One of the variables
is
'Students' methods of transport
to
college.' Here the obvious way to arrange our data is in the form
of a table, showing the frequency with which each category of
transport (bus,
car,
train,
etc.) was mentioned. This
will be a
FREQUENCY TABLE.
A convenient way to build up such a table (e.g., when checking
questionnaire-responses) is to make a tally mark for each member
of the sample alongside the category into which he (or she) falls.
* By the way,
I hope you will sympathize with me in the impossibility of
finding examples that could be of equal interest to the variety of people
(psychologists,
economists,
geographers,
engineers,
teachers,
biologists,
sociologists, etc.) who may be reading this book.
If the idea of pulse-rales
seems boring and irrelevant to your interests, please
feel
free to imagine
that the numbers refer instead to test-scores, cell-thicknesses, crop-yields,
work-days lost through industrial disputes, breaking strengths of materials,
or whatever does seem
appropriate. The same
statistical concepts
will
apply, whatever the figures refer to.
38

Tables and diagrams
39
(As you'll see in the table below, we tally the observations by
making a vertical stroke for each new member until we get to the
fifth, whose stroke goes across the previous four; then we start
building up towards
the
next
'bundle' of
five. The resulting
bundles are easy to count up afterwards.)

Total = 50 students
The 'tally marks' have been added up at the end of each row to
give
the
actual number
of students
in
each
category. When
dealing with a sample, as here, however, we are usually more
interested
in
proportions - because we wish
to
estimate
the
proportions in the total population. Hence it is normal to convert
the figures to percentages. This
I have done
in the table that
follows, but
I have left the original figures in brackets, so that our
readers are in no doubt about the size of the sample. I have also
tidied things up by rearranging the categories in order of size.

Summarizing our data
What else might we do to show up the difference in proportions
here? The obvious thing
is to illustrate the figures with a block
DIAGRAM - with each block proportional m height to the number
of students in a category:

Another way of
illustrating such
category-data
is
to
use a
PIE CHART. Here, a circle
is divided mto slices, with the angle
each makes at the center of the circle being proportional to the
frequency in the category concerned.
I would say that one of the two types of diagram above
is
preferable if you want to emphasize how each category compares
in size with the whole. But the other
is preferable
if you want to
compare the size of one category with that of each of the others.

Do you agree? Which type of diagram do you think is preferable
for each of these two purposes ?

I think the pie chart is clearer if we wish to compare each category
(slice) with the total. But the block diagram seems clearer
if we
want to compare one category with another (by comparing the
heights of the columns).
Whichever diagram we use,
it
is apparent that a large propor-
tion of the sample cycles to college. Clearly, if that proportion
is
true
for
the
1,000-strong
student-population
as
a
whole,
then the college will need considerable space for storing bicycles.
Again, college staff may wish to compare the figures with those
from previous years. For example, the proportion of students
travelling by car may be known for each of the last several years
up to 1981. When put on a chart, they look like this:

Up to 1978, only about 2% of students travelled by car. Then the
proportion began to increase. IJ the trend were to continue after
1981
(as shown by the broken
line), about what percentage of
students would be travelling to college by car by 1985?

If the trend were to continue (and
it's a big if), about 20% of
students would be travelling by car by 1985.
Data arranged as in the chart above, recording a succession or
series of values of a variable over time, is called a time series.

42
Summarizing our data
The analysis of time series - looking for trends over a long period
of time, and for regular fluctuations within a shorter period -
is
an important statistical technique in business, economic history,
medicine, and a variety of other activities.
Another useful approach to the kind of category-data we have
been
talking of so
far might
be
to carry
out what are called
'cross-tabulations' or 'cross-breaks.' That
is, we break down
each category -
splitting up
the members
within
it
into sub-
categories on the
basis of what we know about them on some
other
variable we
have
inquired
into,
e.g.
attendance
record,
membership of college societies, age, sex, etc.
(I expect you have
heard about the members of a sample being broken down by age
and sex!) Thus,
it might emerge that women account for most
of the bus-travellers and very few of the cyclists; the car-users are
almost exclusively third-year students; and the women who live
far away from
college
are
far
less
likely
to
be
late
for early-
morning classes than are the men; but the women are less likely
to stay on, or make a special journey, to attend college functions;
and so on. Such findings may all be of relevance to understanding
life within the college.
Now
let's
see how we might summarize some data from a
quantity-variable. We have measured the pulse-rate of each of our
50 students. Here are the figures in the order we recorded them:

Presented like this,
it's hard to get to grips with such figures. Is
there any pattern in them ? What
is the general picture ? How easy
is
it, for example, to pick out the minimum and maximum pulse-
rates? Are the other pulse-rates spread out evenly between the
minimum and maximum, or are some
pulse-rates much more
common than others?
Suppose you know your own pulse-rate to be about 74 beats

these students' pulse-rates? (Don't spend more than half a minute
on this.)

You no doubt decided that
it wasn't at all easy to get that infor-
mation out of the block of figures. Perhaps you felt it might have
been easier if the figures had been arranged in order of size. Let's
do that and see whether it helps reveal any pattern:

By the way, when the observed values of a quantity-variable are
arranged in order (as they are here, for example)
it
is called an
array or, more generally, a distribution.
Looking at the distribution above, we can now at least see the
minimum and maximum pulse-rates: 62 and 96 beats per minute.
This gives us the range. In statistics, the range is the difference
between the maximum and minimum values you observe in the
variable. In this case, 96 minus 62 gives a range of 34 beats per
minute.
What else have we gained by arranging the observed values in
order of size? One thing we can locate fairly easily is the median
value. The median (from the Latin for 'middle')
is one way we
might indicate the center of a distribution. It is often quoted as a
kind of representative value.
In fact, the median
is whatever value splits a distribution
in
half. There should be as many observed values greater than the
median as there are less. Thus,
if the following were the number
of miles cycled per week by seven students:
0
16
18
20
33
48
68
the median would be 20 (miles per week). That
is the value with
equal numbers of observations greater and lesser.

44
Summarizing our data
When the number of observed values
is even, then of course
there
will
be no observed value with equal numbers of values
either side of it. In such cases, the median
is quoted as the value
half-way between the two middle values. Thus,
if the student
cycling 68 miles had not been part of the sample and our distri-
bution looked like this:
0
16
18
20
33
48
the median would
be half-way between
18 and 20
(the two
18
4- 20
middle values). â^â =19; and 19
is the value (even though
no student actually cycled just 19 miles) that has equal numbers
either side of it.
If the two middle observations happen to be of the same value,
then that value
is given as the median. Thus,
if the student who
cycled 20 miles had cycled two less, the two middle values would
have been 18 and that would have been the median.
What
is the median of our distribution of pulse-rates above?
Here we have 50 observed values, so we need the value that exceeds
25 of them and falls short of the other 25. We split the difference
79
_i_ go
between the 25th and the 26th value, giving
^â ~ ^9.5 beats
per minute as the median.
The median
is one kind of 'representative' average va'ue (even
when
it
is not a value
that was actually observed). But a far
more commonly quoted representative value is the arithmetic
MEAN. The mean
is what
is normally
called
*the average'
in
elementary arithmetic (though actually there are several kinds of
average besides the arithmetic mean and the median). The mean is
calculated by adding together all the observed values and dividing
by
the number of observations. Thus we would calculate the
mean number of miles cycled by the seven students mentioned
earlier as follows:
0 4- 16 + 18 + 20 + 33
-1- 48 + 68 _ 203 _ ^9 miles.

Tables and diagrams
45
Again, no student cycled exactly 29 miles, just as no Ameri-
can family actually has the mean number of children - 2.35!
As I promised you no calculations,
I won't set you the daunting
task of adding up the 50 pulse-rates and dividing by
fifty.
Til
simply tell you that the mean pulse-rate is 79.1 beats per minute.
Notice that
it
is not quite the same as the median.
Is your own pulse-rate above or below the 'average' of this
sample?

Weil, T don't know about yours, but mine is well below average
for this sample. And this
is a very common use of the idea of
average.
It enables us to locate a particular individual score or
value
(e.g.
one's own
pulse-rate) with
respect
to some value
typical or representative of a distribution.
How far have we got in describing our set of data? Arranging
the pulse-rates in order of size made it easier to pick out maximum
and minimum
values and the median
value.
(It
also made
it
easier for me to calculate the mean, but
I won't trouble you with
the details.) What has perhaps not yet become clear, however, is
the averall shape of the distribution.
For example, looking back at the distribution, how easy is
it to
see whether the observed values are spread out fairly evenly over
the range or whether they tend to bunch together at any point ?
(Again, don't spend more than half a minute on this.)

Well,
it certainly wasn't obvious at a glance. In
fact, we can
convey a better idea of the pattern of the distribution as a whole
by 'picturing'
it. The 'dot-diagram' below reveals that the pulse-
rates tend to bunch around the middle of the range. For instance,
Each dot represents one student

Pulse-rate (beats per minute)

46
Summarizing our data
each pulse-rate between 77 and 82 has been recorded for more
separate students than has any bigger or smaller pulse-rate.
An arrangement in diagrammatic or tabular form like the one
above
is called a frequency distribution
It shows up the
frequency with which each value in the distribution was observed.
For instance, how frequently were pulse-rates of (i) 90 and (ii) 69
beats per minute recorded?
Pulse-rates of 90 were recorded on two occasions (frequency = 2)
but pulse-rates of 69 were not recorded at
all (frequency = 0).
We can use the frequency distribution as pictured in the dot-
diagram to check whether any pulse-rate was more frequently
recorded than any other. The value in a distribution that has been
observed with greatest frequency
is called the mode of the dis-
tribution.
It
is the most 'fashionable' or
* popular' value. Thus,
size 8
IS the mode, or modal value, in men's shoes -
it
is the size
that shoe shops sell most of. The mode can be another way of
indicating a typical or representative value among those recorded.
It
is a third kind of 'average
.'
In the distribution above, no one value has been observed more
frequently than any
other. There are two values (80 and
81)
sharing greatest popularity. We would say the distribution there-
fore has two modes (80 and 8 1
) and, since they are close together,
this might help someone trying to picture
it.
In fact, the mode is often most useful as a description when the
sample concerns categories rather than quantity-variables. For
example, suppose a survey of college teachers showed that more
were
married
than
were
divorced,
single
or
widowed;
then
'married' would be the modal category. (There
is no way of
calculating a mean or median with category-variables.)
Returning now to our set of pulse-rates, what else can we do to
bring out the pattern within the distribution? One thing we can
do
is to group the observations. For example, we can ask how
many observations are there of at least 60 but less than 65 ... at
least 65 but less than 70 ... at least 70 but less than 75
.
.
. and so
on. If we do, we get a table like this:

50 = TOTAL
An arrangement like this
is called a grouped frequency distribu-
tion.
It brings out the overall pattern even more clearly - in this
case, a bunching of observed values
in the middle. But
it loses
information about the individual values observed. For instance,
the fastest pulse-rate recorded could be 95 or 96 or 97 or 98 or 99
beats per minute. Detail has been sacrificed to clarify the overall
pattern.
We can bring out the pattern in 2i grouped ^r^qu^ncy distribution
even more clearly with a histogram. This
is a block diagram
whose blocks are proportional
in area to the frequency in each
class or group. In the histogram below, the group * 70-74 beats per
minute' has twice as many members as the class
* 90-94' - and so
its
block
is
twice
as
big.

points of the classes.)

And the total area enclosed by the histogram (that
is, the shaded

is proportional to the number of observations (50). If we
drew a similar histogram for, say, 25 students on these scales,
it
would occupy only half the space.

would you say is the modal class ?

The modal class is the one with the largest frequency. In this case

the class* 75-79').
So what have we noticed so far about summarizing the results
obtained from a sample? We have seen
that a
set of *raw
data' - the untreated figures - can be rather obscure. The first
step is to rearrange them in order of size. Grouping them may also
help emphasize any
pattern
within the distribution. And
dia-
grams give a better idea of the shape of the distribution than do
figures alone.
Also, we have begun to look for figures (like an average, or the
range) that quantify important features of the distribution. In
fact, to describe a distribution statistically, or to use it in making
inferences or predictions, we must have such figures. The two
most important of them are a measure of central tendency
(or average) and a measure of dispersion (or variability).
Central tendency {averages)
By 'central tendency' we mean the tendency of the observations
to center around a particular value (or
pile up in a particular
category) rather than spread themselves evenly across the range or
among the available categories. We have already noticed three
measures of such a
tendency. These
are
the
three averages:
the mode, median and mean. Which one is used will depend on the
type of variable.
For example, which type of 'measure of central tendency' (or
average) would be used with the following type of data?

The average or measure of central tendency to use with such
'category
data' would be the mode.
'Bicycle' would be
de-
scribed as the modal category. There would be no point work-
ing out a mean number of students per method of transport
(dividing fifty by 6) or in looking for a 'median' method.
While the mode
is most likely to be used when our data con-
cerns categories,
it will not be much used with quantity-variables.
There, the average used will probably be the mean or, occasion-
ally, the median.
As
a
measure
of
central
tendency,
the mean
has
several
advantages, the chief one being that
it
is fairly stable from one
sample to another, that
is,
if we take a number of samples from
the same population, their means are likely
to differ
less than
their medians or their modes. Thus, a sample mean gives us the
most reliable estimate of central tendency in the population.
However, there are some situations where
it may be as well to
concentrate on the sizes of the middle values only and use the
median
instead of the mean. For example, look
at
these two
distributions of earnings. Each represents a different group of
five people:
X
$30,000
$38,000
$42,000
$57,000
$73,000
Y
$30,000
$38,000
$42,000
$57,000
$244,000
The median income
is the same for each group - $42,000.

Summarizing our data
But, while the mean income of group X
is $48,000, the mean
for group Y is $82,200.
Either mean or median could reasonably
* represent' group X.
But which average would give the better idea of typical earnings in
group Y ? Would
it be (a) mean or (b) median?

In group Y, the median would give a better idea of typical earn-
ings. The mean
has
been
boosted
considerably
by one
very
unusual value, while the median remains unaffected.
So the median
is preferable in distributions where there are
a few extreme
(high or low)
values observed. The
effect of
these extreme values would be to distort the mean, pulling
it
too far away from the center of the distribution.
Also, the median must be used where there is uncertainty about
the sizes of some of the values in the distribution. For example,
suppose we are given the ages of five bus passengers as follows:
Under 12,
22,
48,
54,
over 65 years.
Here we can't calculate the mean age (unless we arbitrarily assign
ages to the youngest and the oldest person). But the median
is
clearly 48
years.
Half the
passengers
are
older and
half are
younger.
So the mean (or sometimes the median)
is the value we nor-
mally quote to indicate the center of the distribution. Next, if we
are dealing with a quantity-variable, we need a measure of the
extent
to which the observed values are spread out from
this
center. The more variable the values, the more dispersed they will
be - so we are looking for a measure of dispersion (or vari-
ability).
Measures of dispersion
To get a picture of dispersion, compare the two dot-diagrams
below. The first of them is the one you have already seen.

What seems to you the most striking difference between the two
distributions? Can you mention a figure (a statistic that you have
already met) that would help quantify the difference?
:|c

To me, the most striking difference is that the observed values in
B are far less spread out than they are in A. Perhaps the simplest
way of quantifying
dispersion
in
the two
distributions
is
to
compare the ranges:
In A, range = 96 â 62 = 34 beats
In B, range = 88 â 70 = 18 beats
Clearly there
is much
less variability
in sample B than
in A.
Now the range
is a rough-and-ready measure of dispersion.
Its great virtue
is
that
it
is so easy
to calculate and
is
fairly
apparent at a casual glance. However, the range
is not usually a
measure we can put much trust in.
It depends totally on just two
values -
the two most extreme
cases. These may be
quite
untypical of any other values in the sample. You've seen this
already in the income distribution of group Y on page 49.
We can make the point also with dot-diagrams. Here are the
marks gained by two different groups of twenty students on a
test:

Which of the two distributions above would you tend to say is
the more dispersed - group X or group Y? Does
it also have
the bigger range?
Â«
4c

#
Overall, surely, the distribution of group X seems to be the more
dispersed. In group Y, apart from the two extreme values, only
four different values (all adjacent) - 10, 11, 12, 13 -were observed,
whereas thirteen different values were observed
in X. However,
thanks to the influence of the two extreme values
in Y.
its
range is bigger than that of X.
One way of getting a
'fairer' measure
of dispersion
is
to
take a kind of 'mini-range' from nearer the center of a
dis-
tribution, thus avoiding any extremes. This range
is based on
what are called the quartiles of the distribution. Just as the
median
is the value that cuts the observations
in two, so the
quartiles
are
the values
that
cut
the observations
into
four
equal lots:
25% of the
observations

25% of the

As the diagram shows, there are three quartiles, Qi, Q2, and Q3.
The second quartile is the same value as the median.
The
* mini-range'
1 mentioned above
is
called
the inter-
quartile range. It is the distance between Qi and Q3.

Measures of dispersion
53
Let's apply this to our two distributions, group X and group
Y. Since there are twenty observations
in each, we want
the
value that cuts off the bottom five values and the top five. Thus,
Q, will be a value half-way between the fifth and sixth observa-
tions. Q3 will be the value half-way between the fifteenth and
sixteenth.
In distribution X, the fifth value
is 8 and the sixth value
is 9.
So Qi = 8i. Also, since the fifteenth value is 14 and the sixteenth
is 15, Q3 = 14i.

Q, = SYz
Q2 = 1472

Therefore the inter-quartile range = 14^ â 8^ = 6 marks.
What is the inter-quartile range for distribution Y ?
*
*
*
*
*
*
In distribution Y, the fifth value
is 10 and the sixth
is
11. So
Oi =
lOi. The fifteenth value
is
13 and the sixteenth
is
14, so
Q3 = 13i, and the inter-quartile range = 13^ â 10^ = 3 marks.
You will no doubt agree that the inter-quartile range gives a
more reasonable indication of the dispersion in these two distri-
butions than does the full range.
The inter-quartile range
is the measure of dispersion you will
often find used along with the median. But
it's time we began to
concentrate now on
the measure of dispersion
that
is more
commonly used than any other: the standard deviation.
Like the mean,
the standard deviation takes
all the observed
values into account.
How
does the standard
deviation work?
If there were no
dispersion at all in a distribution, all the observed values would be
the same. The mean would also be the same as
this repeated
value. No observed value would deviate or differ from the mean.
But, with dispersion, the observed values do deviate from the

54
Summarizing our data
mean, some by a lot, some by only a little. Quoting the standard
deviation of a
distribution
is a way of indicating a kind of
'average' amount by which all the values deviate from the mean.
The greater the dispersion,
the
bigger the deviations and the
bigger the standard
(* average') deviation.
Which of these sets of values would you expect to have the
larger standard deviation ?
(a)

49
64
(mean = 36)
(b)
111
114
117
118
120
(mean = 116)
The values in (a) are more dispersed (that
is, they deviate more
from the mean) than those in (b), so we can expect the standard
deviation to be larger. Let's see how this works out. In (b) the
values differ from the mean of
1 16 as follows:
Value:
111
114
117
118
120
Deviation from 116:

+2

Now we can't simply take an average (arithmetic mean) of the
deviations because we'll find they always add up to zero - the
negative deviations
will exactly cancel out the
positive. So, to
overcome this difficulty, we square each deviation, thus getting
rid of the minus signs:
Deviation:
â5
â2
+1
+2

Squared deviation:

The mean of these squared deviations
is called the variance:

Variance =

"^"5~^
The variance
is a measure with uses of its own (as we'll see later
in
this book). But
it does have one disadvantage for everyday
practical purposes: if the original values (and therefore the mean)
of the distribution were
in
units
of,
let's say,
*heart-beats per
minute', then the variance would be so many
square heart-beats
per minute'! This would hardly be an easy idea to play around
with. So, to get the measure of dispersion back into the same units

Measures of dispersion
55
as the observed values (and the measure of central tendency),
we take the square root of the variance - and this is what we call
the standard deviation:

As
1 am sure you predicted, we see that the standard deviation of
distribution
(a)
is very much greater than
that of (b). This
is
because distribution (a)
is much more dispersed.
Look back now at the two distributions pictured on page 52.
Which of those would you expect to have the larger standard
deviation ?
Of the two distributions on page 52, X has a larger standard
deviation than Y
: 4.3 marks, as compared with 3.3 marks.
Now look back at the two distributions (A and B) pictured on
page 51. One of the pairs of figures in the
list below shows the
standard deviations for the two distributions. Which would you
think
is the correct pair? Which of the two standard deviations
belongs to which of the distributions?
(a) 4.6 and 7.6 beats per minute;
(b) 7.6 and 37 beats per minute; or
(c) 19 and 37 beats per minute.

56
Summarizing our data
The standard deviation of A
is 7.6 and that of B is 4.6 beats per
minute.
1 don't suppose you had any trouble deciding that the
larger standard deviation in the pair went with the more dispersed
distribution. But was
it difficult deciding which was the correct
pair ?
I hope you were able to reject pair (b) by noticing that even
if 7.6 were correct for the
less dispersed distribution, 37 would
exceed even the range in the other. Similarly, the figures given in
pair (c) would exceed the range for both distributions.
In fact, the standard deviation never approaches anywhere near
the range. Even with a very highly dispersed set of values
like:
1
2
3
997
998
1000
where the range is 999, the standard deviation
is only about 500.
With samples of about ten, the standard deviation can be expected
to be about one third of the range. With samples of one hundred,
it will be down to about one fifth. These rough ratios may be
helpful
if you ever need to guess a standard deviation.
So how do we summarize the data provided by sample mem-
bers? Rather than presenting
it 'raw' we can:
(1) display
it
in some kmd of table that shows up any pattern
within
it; and
(2) illustrate
it with a diagram that gives a picture of the quanti-
ties involved; and
(3) find a suitable figure to indicate
its 'central tendency'
(e.g.
mode, median
or mean)
and,
in
the
case
of a
quantity-
variable,
another
figure
to
indiciate
its
'dispersion'
(e.g.
range, inter-quart ile range, or standard deviation).
The type of table, diagram and figure we'd use would depend
chiefly on whether the data related to category-variables or to
quantity-variables. In the next chapter we'll build on these ideas.

4. The shape of a distribution
With the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation you have
two very powerful ways of describing most statistical distributions
that
involve
quantity-variables. (And
the median and
inter-
quartile range can be useful statistics on occasions too.) However,
we must not overlook the descriptive power of pictures, particu-
larly in conveying the overall shape of the distribution.
It may or may not have struck you that
all the distributions
we've looked at so far have been fairly symmetrical. Indeed, they
have all been symmetrical
in the same way: most observations
being recorded near the center of the range of values and gradu-
ally thinning out towards the extremes. Here
is one example:

Skewed distributions
59
The histogram on the left (a) is for scores on test X, while histo-
gram (b) represents the score distribution on test Y.
Clearly, the two distributions are not at all symmetrical Unlike
those we've looked at so far, the bulk of the observations are not
found in the middle of the range of marks (around 20-30) with
numbers of observations falling off fairly evenly to either side as
the more extreme values are recorded. Rather, in each distribu-
tion the bulk of the observations are piled up towards one end of
the range and
tail
off gradually towards
the
other.
But
the
distributions differ in that each piles up towards a different end.
Such distributions as this are said to be skewed. The skew
is
the long tail of observations. (I found
it helpful to remember that
''queue'' is French for 'tail* and think of the *skew' as *s(queue)'.)
A distribution can be positively or negatively skewed
: positively,
if the skew (tail)
is on the right (positive) side; negatively,
if the
skew (tail)
is on the left (negative) side.
Which of the two distributions above is positively, and which
negatively, skewed?

Distribution
(a)
is
positively
skewed
while
(b)
is
negatively
skewed. In (a) the long tail
is on the right: in (b)
it is on the left.
Although the maximum and minimum observed values in each
distribution are much the same, the means are greatly different.
In (a) the mean
is 17.1 marks; in (b)
it
is 30.2 marks.*
It is worth noticing the effect that skewness has on the relative
sizes and positions of mean, median and mode. In symmetrical
distributions of the kind we were looking at
earlier,
all
three
measures of central tendency are to be found in the same pl ace -
at the center. Look at this simple dot-diagram, for instance:
*In case youVe wondering how
I calculated the mean of a grouped dis-
tribution,
I operated as though all the observations for a particular group
of values were recorded for the value at the mid-point of that group. Thus,
for example,
I treated the eleven observations of '20-24 marks'
in
(a) as
though they were all recorded for a mark of 22.
1 would operate likewise in
calculating the standard deviation. The result will be very
little different
from what would have been obtained, using the *raw* marks.

60
The shape of a distribution
2
Mode
Median
Mean
It shows one observation of value 1, two of 2 and one of 3. The
mode - the most frequently observed value -
is 2. The median -
the
value
that
splits
the
distribution
into
equal numbers
of
observations larger and smaller - is 2. And the mean - the total
value of the observations shared out equally between them,
i.e.
1+2+2+3
.
,
^
â
^
â
...
IS also 2.
4
Now let's see what happens if we skew that simple distribution
by adding a couple of observations to one side, thus giving
it a
tail. We will add one observation of 4 and one of 5
How does this influence the three averages? Well, the most
frequently observed value
is
still 2; so 2 remains the mode. But
what about the median? Since there are now
six observations
(rather than four) in the distribution, the median has to
lie mid-
way between the values of the third and the fourth. The third
observation is a 2 and the fourth is a 3 ; so the median is 2^. The
median,
then, has been dragged away from the mode,
in the
direction of the skew.
And what about the mean ? Where will
it lie in relation to the
other two averages, now that the distribution is skewed?

Skewed
distributions
61
The mean gets pulled even further in the direction of the skew,
because
it is influenced by the size of the new observations as well
as their number. In fact, the mean of the new distribution is
1 +2 + 2 + 3+4 + 5
17
So, in the skewed distribution, the position of the three averages
is like this:
0

if we'd had a distribution with a tail on the other side, the

In a skewed distribution, the relative positions of the three
averages
is always
predictable. The mode
will
be under
the
peak of the distribution, the mean will have been pulled out in the
direction of the skew (whether to
left or right) and the median
will be in between the mode and the mean. The greater the skew-
ness, the greater will be the distance between the mode and the
mean. (There is a statistic known as the 'coefficient of skewness'
which is calculated from this relationship, but you probably won't
often see
it used.)
I'll now show you our two mark -distributions again, this time
with arrows indicating where the three averages are in each:

By the way, there is an explanation for the two different kinds
of skewness on these two tests. Distribution (a) shows students'
marks on a mathematics test soon after lessons began, while (b)
shows how they performed at the end of the course. Clearly, the
great majority did very much
better, although a few students
seem not to have benefited and are still in the low-score groups.
Looking back at the histograms, can you form an impression
as to whether dispersion
in
distribution
(b) has increased, de-
creased or stayed about the same as in distribution (a)?

Skewed distributions
63
Well,
there
really
is
little
obvious
difference.
However,
dis-
persion
in distribution (b)
is rather smaller than in distribution
(a). Notice that the range
is slightly
less and the three highest
columns slightly higher.
In
fact the standard deviation
in
dis-
tribution (b)
is 8.1 marks, compared with 9.1 marks in (a). (So
these summary figures reveal what
is not too apparent
in the
diagrams.)
All
distributions you meet
in
practice are
likely
to have a
certain amount of skewness. It can be even more exaggerated than
we have seen in the above example.
For instance, suppose you stood at a busy cross-roads each
day for a month and counted the number of traffic accidents each
day. You might well find that you recorded 0 accidents on more
days than you recorded any other value - followed by 1, 2, 3, 4

Other everyday examples of highly skewed distributions might
be the incomes of salary-earners or the number of faults in each
of a batch of newly produced television tubes.
In this book, however, we will be concentrating on the very
common kind of distribution that
is fairly symmetrical around a
central peak. Before we go on to consider this further, though,
we ought to notice that there could be other kinds of symmetrical
distributions. For instance we could have 6/modal symmetry as in

Introducing the normal distribution
Before we talk any further about distributions,
let's simplify the
way we picture them. Instead of drawing dots or bars, we'll use
the outline that defines the boundary of the distribution.
If we
join up the uppermost dots in a dot-diagram, or the tops of the
bars
in a histogram, with a smooth curved
line, we get what
is
called thecuRVE of the distribution. This is the underlying
shape of the distribution. For mstance, here are our two distri-
butions with their underlying curves:

Your curves should look roughly like this:
Now let's try the same thing with a dot-diagram. Here again
is our distribution of 50 student pulse-rates. As you see, if we try
to outline
it with a curve, the result is pretty lumpy:
50 students

100
Pulse-rate (beats per minute)
Although the students tend to pile up towards the middle of the
range, they don't do so very evenly, and the curve contains a
number of
* peaks' and
* valleys.' It is not as smooth as those we
have looked at so far.

66
The shape of a distribution
However, suppose we measured the pulse-rates of 25 more
students and added them to our dot-diagram. It would then show
the distribution of 75
pulse-rates. We could go on to measure
more and more students, so as to show the distribution of, say,
100, 150 or 200 pulse-rates.
As we added to our distribution, we would find the *peak-and-
valley' effect beginning to disappear. As the sample-size increased,
the outline curve of its distribution would become smoother and
smoother. For instance:

diagrams. After all, the area under a curve is, like that in a histo-
gram, proportional to the number of observations. So, if I'd kept
to the same scale as before, I'd have needed a much taller diagram
to represent thousands of students rather than just a couple of
hundred.)
The shape of the distribution above follows what
is called the
NORMAL CURVE of distribution. (This curve was first recognized

68
The shape of a distribution
in
the seventeenth century by
the
English
mathematician,
de
Moivre.) The curve is bell-shaped and perfectly symmetrical; and
its mean (and mode and median)
is in the center.
As with any distribution curve (normal or not), a line drawn
vertically upwards from a value on the base-line will cut the area
enclosed by the curve into two slices. With a
* normal' distribu-
tion, as you'll soon see, we'll be able to find out what percentage
of the observations lie on either side of that particular value of the
variable.
For instance,
in the diagram above, what percentage of the
total observations
lies on either side of the mean (marked by a
vertical broken line)?
The mean here is in the center of a perfectly symmetrical distribu-
tion. So the broken line cuts the total area into two equal slices,
so that 50% of the observations lie on one side of the mean and
50% on the other side.
The normal curve may be tall and thin, or short and stocky, or
slumping out very flatly. This depends on whether the standard
deviation
is small or large - or on the relationship between the
particular
vertical
and
horizontal
scales
on
which we
have
chosen to draw the graph. For instance,
in the diagram below,
notice how the curve gets flatter and flatter as we compress the
vertical scale compared with the horizontal scale.

But whatever the height or width of the normal curve, the
distribution of the area under it is always the same. In the diagram
above, the proportion of the total area that lies between, say, 15
and 20 on the horizontal scale
is the same under each of the
three curves.
Below, I've drawn three different curves {a, b and c), all on the
same chart. Which of the three curves looks most like that of a
'normal' distribution?

Uti
Curve b looks most like that of a normal distribution. It
is not
only symmetrical about a central peak (which c is not) - but it also
appears to have about the right proportions (which a does not).
When we call this the
' normal' curve, we do not mean that
it is
the
* usual ' curve. Rather,
* norm '
is being used in the sense of a
pattern
or standard -
ultimate,
idealized,
'perfect' -
against
which we can compare the distributions we actually find in the
real world. And
it
is a fact that many such distributions (e.g. the
sizes or weights of natural or man-made objects of a given type)
do come close to this idealized curve. That
is to say, they are
reasonably symmetrical and bell-shaped about a central mean.
We must remember, though, that the normal curve is a mathe-
matical abstraction - defined by what I'm sure many of my readers
\^oald regard as a particularly horrendous-looking equation! -
and
it assumes an infinitely large population. Samples of the size
we get
in everyday
life
will never produce so perfect a curve.
However, quite a small sample can often produce a fairly bell-
shaped distribution. This may not have been too apparent in our
dot-diagram of 50 student pulse-rates (though
it was certainly

70
The shape of a distribution
becoming clear with a sample of 100). But, even with 50, there is
the suggestion of a central peak, with observations gradually (if
unevenly) thinning out to either side:

As you'll see, the curve based on the grouped data
is
still rather
lumpy and somewhat skewed; but
it does bear more of a resem-
blance to the normal curve:
c
Pulse-rate (beats per minute)
So, even with quite a small
real-life sample, the distribution
can look as if it
is 'trying' to be normal! This suggests that such
a sample may have come from a larger population whose distri-
bution could indeed be described by the normal curve.
When
this
is
the
case, we can
interpret
the sample,
using
certain powerful
characteristics of the normal
distribution.
In
fact,
the
normal
curve
is
characterized
by
the
relationship

Introducing the normal distribution
71
between
its mean and
its standard deviation. The shape of the
normal distribution
is such that we can state the proportion of the
population
that
will
lie between any two
values of the
variable.
To accomplish
this,
all we need to know
is the mean and the
standard deviation. We can then regard any given value
in the
distribution as being *so many standard deviations' away from
the mean. We use the standard deviation as a unit of measure-
ment.
For instance, suppose we have a sample of student pulse-rates
with a mean of 80 and a standard deviation of 6 beats per minute.
A student whose pulse-rate is 86 beats per minute would be *one
standard deviation above the mean.'
(Let's abbreviate standard
deviation to SD when we're using
it as a unit of measurement.)
Similarly, a
student whose
pulse-rate
is 74
beats
per minute
could be said to be
1 SD below the mean. A pulse-rate of 89 beats
per minute would be H SD above the mean, and so on.
In terms of mean = 80 and SD = 6, how would you describe
the pulse-rates of students who recorded
(i) 98 beats per minute,
(ii) 77 beats per minute and
(iii) 68 beats per minute? How far
(in SDs) IS each one above or below the mean ?

is 2 SD (i.e. 2x6)
below the mean.
If we draw just the base-line of the histogram or curve of the

The shape of a distribution
Thus any value in a distribution can be re-expressed as so many
SDs above or below
the mean. This we can do whether the
distribution
is normal or not. But when
it
is normal (or approxi-
mately
so), we can use what we know of the normal curve to
estimate how many observations lie between any two given values.
The standard deviation slices up a bell-shaped distribution into
'standard '-sized slices, each slice containing a known percentage
of the
total observations. You've already noticed
that
half of
them
lie on either side of the mean.
But, as you'll
see below,
about two-thirds of them are to be found within one standard
deviation either side of the mean - one-third on one side, and one-
third on the other.
Proportions under the normal curve
Look at the curve of the normal distribution below as it falls away
from
its peak on either side. At first the slope
is convex (bulging
outwards) as
it
falls faster and
faster. But at a certain point -
known as the
* point of inflection' (bending back) -
it becomes
concave (bulging inwards) as the slope begins to
level
off. The
distance between the mean and the point of inflection on either
side
is equal to the standard deviation. About f (68%) of all the
observations
in a normal
distribution
lie within one standard
deviation either side of the mean. We call this range
* Mean plus
or minus one SD', or M dz
1 SD.

We know that M Â±
1 SD (the range between
1 SD below the mean
and
1 SD above
it) encloses about 68% of the observations. So
100 â 68 = 32% must
lie outside this range. Since the distribu-
tion is symmetrical, we can expect half of the 32% (that is 16%) to
lie below â1 SD and the other 16% to lie above +1 SD.

Let me give you an example of how you might use this know-
ledge. A police radar check has monitored the speeds of 1,000

is
approximately normal. Suppose

is
45 mph and the standard deviation 5 mph.

The shape of a distribution
The legal speed limit of 40 mph
is
I standard deviation (5 mph)
below the mean speed of 45 mph. So the 50% of cars travelling
faster than the mean speed plus the 34% between the mean and
- 1 SD were all breaking the law. 50% + 34 % = 84%, and 84%
of 1,000 is 840 cars.

(If the 1,000 cars were a random sample of all cars passing the
check-point, then we would be justified
in making similar esti-
mates about speeding within that population. But more of this in
the next chapter.)
So we've seen that the range of values within one standard
deviation either side of the mean takes in about two-thirds of the
observations. What happens if we extend the range by an amount
equal to another standard deviation on either side? We find that
95% of the observations lie within about two (actually 1.96) stan-
dard deviations either side of the mean:

(iii)

of the observations lie beyond mean Â±3 SD. Hence,
in the
normal distribution, the standard deviation is about equal to
one-sixth of the total range.)

76
The shape of a distribution
In fact, there are tables that will tell us what percentage of the
observations are cut off by any given value in a distribution. All
we have to do is translate 69 heart-beats per minute, or 5 1 mph (or
whatever) into so many SDs above or below the mean. Then (even
with 'awkward' fractions like â1.85 SD or +2.33 SD) we can
use the tables to read off the percentage of observations (e.g. of
students or of cars) we may expect on either side of that value.
Some readers will undoubtedly be content to learn that this
is
so. As long as they know that someone else has taken the trouble
to gather the necessary figures, they'll be quite ready to take my
word for
it and will wait for me to
let them know of the most
important
items. Others, however,
will
be suspicious
that
I'm
keeping something up my
sleeve.
They'll
not be content
until
they've at least glimpsed these mysterious tables themselves.
If you're in that
latter category,
you'll find the tables
(in
one form or another)
in the back of many statistics textbooks.
(They enable you
to work out
just what proportion of the
total area under the curve
lies between any two points along
the base-line.) Alternatively, you can look at the panel on the
opposite page, where
I show a selection from such a table.
If, however, you are
willing to take my word
for the main
proportions under the normal curve, simply read on. In this book,
for our present purposes, the approximate proportions shown in
the diagram below should suffice:

Proportions under the normal curve

A selection ofproportions under the normal curve
The figures below are a selection from a table showing the proportions
under the normal curve. That
is, they answer the question: what area
lies between
the mean and any
point on
either
side of
it, whose
distance away
is measured in units of the standard deviation?
The table below will allow you to see the proportion between the
mean and, say, 1.25 SD or
1.50 SD. But the /w// table would show the
proportion between the mean and
1.26 SD
.
.
.
1.265 SD
.
.
. and so
on.
However,
I
have picked out enough
figures
to show you
the
general pattern.
To take an obvious example:
at 0 SD
away from the mean (that
is, at the mean
itself),
.5000
(or 50%)
of the
area
lies
beyond.
But we see that, between the mean and
(Â±)1.00 SD.
lies
0.3413
of
the
area
(or
34.13%).
This we
see
in column
A.
In
column B we see that 0.1587 (or 15.87%)
lies beyond
1.00 SD.
I have bracketed together the figures of
(1.96 and 2.00 SD) and (2.50 and 2.58 SD).
The
reason
is
that,
in
this
book,
I am
using 2 SD and 1\ SD as 'easy' approxi-
mations of the SD-values that cut off 95%
and 99 % of the area (which are actually the
proportions cutoff by 1.96 and 2.58 SD).
To
find
the
proportion
of
the
curve
included on
both
sides of the mean, we
have to double the appropriate figure. Thus
2 x 0.3413 = 0.6826
lies
within
1
SD
either side of the mean. And 2 x 0.1587 =
0.3174 lies beyond this range.
The full tables would allow you to work
in reverse also. Suppose, for some reason,
you wanted
to know how
far from
the
mean you had
to
travel (in terms of SD)
to
include,
say, 49.7% of the
area. You
would look in the body of the table and (as
you
can
see from
the
underlined
figure
alongside) read off the distance of 2.75 SD.
The
full
tables would, of course, enable
you to do this for any propoition: 20%,
25%, 75%, or whatever.

The shape of a distribution
As you'll remember, a normal curve can be
tall and
thin or
wide and spreading - but its proportions will always be the same.
It may interest you to check how far these
* ideal' proportions
are true of our not-so-'normalMooking distribution of pulse-
rates. There, you'll remember, we found a mean of 79.1 beats per
minute and a standard deviation of 7.6
beats per minute, so:
M - 3 SD = 79.1 - (3 X
7.6) =
56.3 beats per minute
M - 2 SD = 79.1 â (2 X
7.6) =
63.9 beats per minute
M â
1 SD = 79.1 â
7.6 =
71.5 beats per minute
M
=79.1 beats per minute
M +
1 SD = 79.1 +
7.6 =
86.7 beats per minute
M + 2 SD = 79.1 + (2 X 7.6) =
94.3 beats per minute
M + 3 SD = 79.1 + (3 X
7.6) = 101.9 beats per minute
None of these seven figures was actually observed, of course,
but let's put them into the distribution of recorded values and see
into what proportions they split the observations.

There are 50 observations (half of 100) altogether. So it's easy to
work out what
percentage of them
lies between each
pair of
SD-points. We simply count them and double the numbers to
get the percentages. For
instance, there are 7 observations be-
tween -1 SD (71.5) and -2 SD
(63.9), which makes 14%.

It seems that the proportions are reasonably close to those pre-
dicted by the normal curve.
Comparing values
So, when we know the mean and standard deviation of a bell-
shaped
distribution, we
also know
a
lot
about
its
internal
proportions. One thing this enables us to do is to compare two or
more
observations from
different
distributions.
For example,
suppose we know that Bill scored 90 in the Economics exam and
Linda scored 80 in Law. We know also that, as
is often the case,
the
students'
scores
within
each
subject
are
approximately
'normal' in distribution. Now, which of our two students has
the
better
score, compared with
his or her fellow-students?
Many people would jump to the conclusion that
it must be Bill
because he has a higher score than Linda. But, conceivably. Bill's
90 might be the lowest score
in Economics, while Linda's 80
might be the highest
in Law. Next, we need to ask how the two
scores relate to those of other students. Well, the mean score in
Economics was 60, and
in Law
it was 65. So both scores are
above average. Bill's by 30 points and Linda's by 15 points. Does
that make Bill's the better score? Not quite. We need to know
how many other students exceeded the mean by as much as Bill
and Linda.
Suppose I now tell you that in Economics the standard devia-
tion was 15 marks, while in Law it was 5 marks. Can you use this

80
The shape of a distribution
information (and what you know about the proportions of the
normal
curve)
to
decide: what
proportion
of
tlie Economics
students exceeded Bill's score of 90? And what proportion of the
Law students exceeded Linda's score of 80? (Look at the diagram
on page 77 to refresh your memory.) So which student had the
better score, compared with
his or her fellow-students?
(It
may help you to sketch out a diagram.)
In Economics, the mean was 60 and the standard deviation was
15 marks. So Bill's score of 90 was wo standard deviations above
the mean (2x15 marks above
60), and
Bill's score would be
exceeded by only 2.5%
of his fellow-students.
In Law,
the
mean was 65 and the standard
deviation was
5
marks. So
Linda's score of 80 was three standard deviations above the
mean (3X5 marks above 65), and Linda's score would be
exceeded
by
only 0.15%
of
her
fellow-students.
Clearly,
then,
as we can
see
in
the diagram
below, Linda
has
the
better score, compared with fellow-students.

The above chart shows the base-line of the distribution measured
off in units of the standard deviation - often called z-values -
and in the scores of the Economics and the Law distributions.

Comparing values
81
In effect, we have translated the observations of both distribu-
tions into z-values.* That is to say, we have re-expressed them as
being so many SDs above or below the means of their distribu-
tions. Thus, we can see at a glance that an Economics score of 30
is equivalent to a Law score of 55, since both are two standard
deviations below the mean.
Again, which is the better score, 60 in Economics or 60 in Law ?

<
60 in Economics is the mean score but, in Law, 60 is one standard
deviation below the mean. So 60 in Economics is the better score.
As you see, converting values to z-values enables us to compare
two different distributions.
It could even allow us to compare
values from two different variables. For example, we might ask
whether
a
particular
student's
blood-pressure
was
as
high
(relative to that of other students) as
his
pulse-rate. We'd be
asking,
' Does his blood-pressure exceed the mean blood-pressure
by as many standard deviation units as his pulse-rate exceeds the
mean pulse-rate?'
So,
if you know the mean and standard of a bell-shaped dis-
tribution, you can do a great deal. You can estimate what propor-
tions of the observations
will
fall above or below or between
various values of the variable. And you can compare values from
two different distributions (or even two different variables) by
first translating them into z-values. Furthermore, whether your
distribution is bell-shaped or not, you can use it as a sample from
which to make predictions about some larger population. How
confident you can be about doing so is what we'll discuss in the
next chapter.
Any value in a distribution can be converted into a z-value by subtracting
the mean of the distribution and dividing the difference by the standard
deviation. For example, when the mean
is 50 and the standard deviation
is
10, a raw score of 60 would have a z-value of
=
-J^ = 1. That is, 1 SD
above mean = z-value of 1.

5. From sample to population
We saw in Chapter 4 that
if we know the mean and standard
deviation of a sample, we can often form a pretty good idea of
its overall shape. We can,
for example, make a well informed
guess as to how many observations were made between this and
that value, or how many exceeded such-and-such a value. This
can be useful
if we are reading a report of someone else's
in-
vestigation and have no access to the raw figures which the two
key measures (mean and standard deviation) are meant to sum-
marize.
However,
it
is usually not the shape of the sample itself that
we are mterested m - or, at least, not for
its own sake. Rather,
we are concerned with how far we can generalize from
it. Is what
we see m the sample true also of some wider population? If the
mean pulse-rate among the 50 students tested
is 79.1
beats per
minute, would that be the mean also if we tested all the students
in the college? The short answer, of course,
is No. But (assuming
the sample is random) the two means would be similar (as would
the dispersion). How similar
is what we'll need to think about
next.
Estimates and inferences
The figures we use to describe our sample can be seen as esti-
mates of the figures that would truly describe the population. In
statistical theory, the distinction between sample and population
is basic.
It
is underlined by calling the sample figures (for mean,
mode, median,
range, standard deviation,
inter-quartile range,
etc.) statistics;
while
the
true
mean,
mode,
etc.,
of
the

population
(which we
cannot know
for
certain)
are
called
PARAMETERS.*
Furthermore, each statistic is normally represented in formulae
by a Roman
letter (e.g. sample mean = x) while parameters are
represented by Greek letters (e.g. population mean =
Since
we won't be using formulae, I'll not ask you to learn the necessary
Greek.
I'll simply abbreviate 'sample-mean'
to *S-mean' and
* population-mean' to 'P-mean',
etc., where necessary. (By the
way, to help your memory, notice that
* sample' and 'statistic,'
which go together, both begin with S. Similarly, 'population' and
'parameter' both happen to begin with P.)
So, a
statistic
is used to estimate a parameter. Knowing the
S-mean, we can estimate the P-mean; S-range suggests P-range;
S-standard deviation
gives some idea of P-standard deviation;
and so on. The process involved
is statistical inference. Let's see
how
it works.
Human nature being what
it
is, we don't need much informa-
tion to prompt us into making inferences. Suppose you look up
from this book now to find yourself being stared at by what you
can only assume must be a gnome, pixie, or elf. He (or she or
it)
is wearing rather fanciful clothes and
is about 10 centimeters in
height.
This
is the first gnome (or whatever) you've seen, and you've
not heard reports of other people's sightings. A
furtive glance
around convinces you
that
there are no more
lurking
in
the
vicinity. So, here you have a sample of one. Not a
lot to go on.
Still, what
is your
best guess as to the average height of the
gnome population from which your sample of one
is drawn?
What further information would you need to be more confident
about your estimate?
*

Your best guess as to P-mean would be 10 cm. However, since
you've seen only one specimen, you have no idea how variable in
*This

But they use
it to mean something like 'dimensions' or 'constraints'; for
example, *We haven't yet faced up to the parameters of this situation.' They
are not talking statistically.

84
From sample to population
height gnomes might be; and so you can't be sure how likely it is
that you've been visited by a particularly small one or large one.
So you need to see more.
All the same,
it would be reasonable to assume that gnome
heights are distributed according to the normal curve. So you'll
realize that some distribution curves for the population are more
likely than others. For instance, which of the curves illustrated
below seem
less
likely and which more
likely to describe the
population? Why?

The curves A and B are least likely to describe the gnome popu-
lation. Curve A would suggest that the gnome who
is watching
you
IS more than
3 SD above the mean which, as
you'll
re-
member, would make him one of the
tallest 0.15%.
Similarly,
curve B would imply that he is more than 2 SD below the mean,

Estimates and inferences
85
and therefore one of the smallest 2^%. So B is a little more likely
than A, but
still very unlikely compared with any of the curves
CI, C2 and C3. Each of these shows distributions with a mean of
10 cm; but, since we know nothing yet about variability in the
gnome species, CI
indicates small dispersion, C2 medium, and
C3 wide dispersion.
Clearly, as shown below, any of these C-curves (let's say C2)
can be shifted to
left or right to some extent and
still remain
fairly plausible. But the further
it moves, putting 10 cm further
and further from its centre, the less likely
it is on the basis of the
one specimen we've seen so far.
centimetres
But suppose our gnome
is suddenly joined by four chums -
measuring 9.2, 9.6,
10.3 and 10.5 cm. We can now make a new
estimate of the population-mean (9.9 cm) based on a sample of
five. We can also make an estimate of the variability or dispersion
in the population based on that in the sample. In fact, the sample-
standard deviation
is only about 0.5 cm, suggesting few gnomes
in the population are likely to be much smaller than 8i cm
or
bigger than 11^ cm (that
is, mean i 3 SD).
It begins to look as
though CI might be a somewhat better guess as to the shape and
position of the population curve.
What
is the point of all this speculation about the heights of
gnomes? Simply to show that we can start making inferences in
novel situations on the basis of very
little information; but that
we must modify those inferences as more information becomes
available. With
little information, many inferences are possible
(though some are very
unlikely). With
increasing information,
more and more of the
possible
inferences can
be ruled
out:

86
From sample to population
fewer and fewer of those that remain will fit the observed facts of
the sample.
But we can never end up with certain knowledge about the
population. Not unless we measure the whole population - in
which case, we are not making an
inference. The best we can
expect
to do
is
to say
that
the
*true' P-mean
or P-standard
deviation, or whatever, has such-and-such a probability of lying
within such-and-such a range of possible
values.
Inference
is
inescapably attended by error, which
all the formulae and com-
putations of statistical method will not eliminate. All they can do
is to make
it explicit.
The logic of sampling
I am not going to bother you with those formulae and computa-
tions; but
it is important for you to understand the logic that lies
behind them. Let's return again to thinking about the pulse-rates
of students in our college. Suppose we want to estimate the mean
pulse-rate
for the population
as a whole. We take a random
sample of 10 students and find that the S-mean
is just over 78.6
beats per minute.
Now suppose we were to take four more random samples of
10 students each. Would you expect the sample-mean in each case
to be 78.6 beats per minute?
9|e
4e
*
*
If you expected the same mean each time, you'd almost certainly
be
disappointed. With
four more samples
of
10,
we'd most
probably get four different S-means. For instance, if we take each
row of the table on page 42 as a random sample of 10, we get the
following S-means: 78.6; 79.6: 78.0; 79.9; 79.4.
Clearly, dispersion or variability
is not a characteristic simply
of the observed values within a sample. The means of samples are
variable too. So, also, are their other statistics. This variability
from one sample to another is known as sampling variation.
Now if we pool our five samples, we get a mean for the total
sample of 50 students of 79.1 beats per minute. (This is the mean

A distribution of sample-means
87
of the five means.) But another random sample of 50 students
would give yet a different mean - maybe 79.4 or 78.9. If we took
bigger samples (e.g. of 100 students at a time), their means would
be
less variable. But the dispersion (due to sampling variation)
would never disappear altogether. So how do we cope with
it ?
A distribution of sample-means
What we do
is this: think of taking a large number of random
samples of a given size from the same population. Each of these
many samples will have
its own sample-mean. Now
let's look at
all those sample-means on their own. Let's see how they compare
in size from smallest to largest, and how many we have of each
size. In other words, imagine we make a frequency distribution
of the sample-means themselves. (Are you
still with me? We're
treating *size of sample-mean' as the variable here.) So we get
a DISTRIBUTION OF S-MEANS.
This distribution of S-means will itself have a mean - the mean
of the S-means.
If we have taken a
large enough number of
samples, the distribution curve of their S-means will center around
the population-mean. That
is, the mean of the S-means
will be
equal to P-mean.
What shape do you imagine the distribution curve of S-means
might have?
4c
:|c
9|c
*
*
if
*
As you may have guessed, the distribution of sample-means will
approximate to the normal distribution. Why
is this? Well,
in
the population, values become
increasingly scarce as they
get
bigger or smaller than the mean of the population. So, in sampling
from that population we are likely to get more observed values
similar in size to the P-mean than very different from
it. Hence,
samples whose observed values are mostly close to the P-mean
are likely to be more numerous than samples with a lot of values
very distant from P-mean. Thus, in turn, samples whose S-means
are similar to the population-mean are also
likely to be more
frequent than samples whose S-means are very different from
it.

88
From sample to population
So, as you see
in the diagram below,
if we were to make a
distribution of S-means, we would find that
it centers around
P-mean, with fewer and fewer larger and smaller S-means either
side of it:
Small
Population-
Large

â¢
Values of sample-means
This
is perhaps the most elegant and valuable feature of the
normal distribution: whether or not the population (and therefore
the samples) is normally distributed, the means we compute from
samples will be approximately normal in distribution. The bigger
the samples (and the more bell-shaped they are), the closer to
normal will be the distribution of their S-means.
In
the
real
world, however, we never see a
distribution of
sample-means, from which
to estimate
the
population-mean.
Usually, as you'll remember, we have to make an estimate of
P-mean on the basis of just one sample. We

error
if we
use
this
single sample-mean
as an
estimate of P-mean. But
.
.
. shall we be more likely to make (a) a
big error? or (b) a small error? (Check with the diagram above.)
:ki
*
*
*
^
*
*
We are more likely to make a small error. In estimating P-mean
from the S-mean of a single sample, the bigger the mistake we
could make (that is, the bigger the difference between S-mean and
P-mean), the less likely we are to make
it. As you can see in the
diagram above, the bigger differences between S-mean and P-

A distribution of sample-means
89
mean are out towards the tails of the distribution. In other words,
fewer and fewer samples have means that are so much smaller or
larger than that of the population.
Now let's look at the amount of dispersion among the sizes of
the sample-means.
Just
as the distribution of S-means has
its
own mean (equal to P-mean), so it has its own standard deviation.
How will this standard deviation among the means of samples
compare with the standard deviation of the population
itself?
Would you expect
it to be larger, smaller, or about the same?
(You may find
it
helpful
to sketch out distribution curves
in
coming to your decision.)
4c
*
4e
*
:ic
*
The standard deviation of the distribution of sample-means will
be smaller than that within the population. That
is to say, the
means of samples will not differ among themselves as much as
do the raw values in the population. The distribution of sample-
means will then, in general, be less dispersed than are ind vidual
samples.
We can illustrate these relationships on the diagram below. It
has three curves, representing (1) the distribution of the popula-
tion, (2) the distribution of just one (rather large) sample, and
(3) the distribution of means from a large number of samples.
P-mean
Values of the variable
Which curve is which ?

90
From sample to population
The population distribution
is (A). The sample, with
its mean
slightly to the right of the population mean, but with similar
range, is (C). And the distribution of sample means, with the same
mean
as the population but a considerably smaller dispersion
than either the sample or the population,
is (B).
So, even though we take only one sample, and therefore have
only one sample-mean, we can
think of
it
as
belonging
to a
distribution
of
possible
sample-means.
And,
provided
we're
thinking of samples of reasonable size, this distribution will be
normal. When we imagine such a distribution for a statistic (like
the mean or standard deviation) drawn from samples, we call
it a SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF A STATISTIC.
As we've seen, the sampling distribution of a statistic will have
a mean and standard deviation of
its own. In the case of the
sampling distribution of S-means, the mean will be the same as
that of the population; but the standard deviation will be smaller
than that of the population.
The standard deviation of a sampling distribution (e.g. of the
sample-means) is called the standard error (SE). (This
is to
distinguish
it from the standard deviation of a sample or of the
population.) The idea of standard error enables us to calcu-
late the chances that a particular sample-mean will be much
bigger or smaller than the population-mean.
For instance, since the distribution of sample-means is normal,
we can say, for example, that about 68% of all sample-means will
lie between the mean and *one standard deviation of the sample-
means^ (one standard error) either side:

Suppose we knew that the mean of the sampling distribution of
mean pulse-rates was 78 beats per minute with a standard error of
1.4 beats per minute. In what percentage of samples would we
expect to find a mean bigger than 79.4 beats per minute?
9ie
4e
A sample with a mean of more than 79.4 beats per minute would
occur in
1 6% of samples. That
is, 79.4 is
1 standard error (SD of
the S-means) above the mean (78); 50% of samples will have a
mean
less than 78; 34% will have a mean between 78 and 79.4;
samples with a mean exceeding 79.4
will
therefore be
in
the
remaining 100 â (50 + 34)% = 16%. For confirmation, see the

92
From sample to population
This
is
all very well, you may say, but how can we expect to
know the mean and standard deviation of a sampling distribution
of means - consisting of the sample-means from a huge number
of samples? All we usually have
is one sample. We know
its
mean and the standard deviation of the observed values within
it.
How are we to determine the standard error of all the possible
sample-means when we have only one sample-mean to go on?
In fact,
it can be shown that the standard error of the mean
is
related
to
three
factors:
(1)
the standard
deviation within the
sample, (2) the size of the sample, and (3) the proportion of the
population covered by the sample.
Let's think about
these
factors one by one.
(1) Would you
expect the standard error of the means
to be
larger when the
samples concerned have small standard deviations or when they
have large standard deviations?
(1) The more variable the values within a sample, the more likely
it
is that the means of such samples would vary
greatly. So a
bigger sample-SD
will
lead
to a bigger SE of the means from
such samples. (Actually, SE depends on variability in the popula-
tion; but provided the sample contains 30 or more observations,
sample-SD
is a sufficiently accurate estimate of population-SD.)
Now
for
the second
factor. How does
the
size of SE
(the
variability of sample-means)
relate
to
the
size of the samples
concerned? (2) Would you expect the standard error of the mean
to be larger when samples are small or when they are large?
4c
*
4c
*
Â«
(2) The
larger the sample,
the
closer (on
average) would
the
means of such samples be to P-mean
in size. Therefore, the less
would be the standard error. The diagram below shows how the
dispersion
of a sampling
distribution
of the sample-mean
is
smaller with big samples than
it
is with small ones:

Again,
I'll just remind you that sampling distributions such as
these are the imaginary result of taking a huge number (actually
an mfinite number) of samples of the relevant size.
Now for the third factor influencing the size of SE. (3) How
would you expect the size of the standard error to be influenced
by increasing the proportion of (he population covered in samples?
)N
*
4:
*
*
(3) The larger the proportion covered
in samples, the lower the
variability (SE) of the means. But, and
it
is a big but - this factor
is
remarkably
unimportant.
It
has
some,
but
very
little,
in-
fluence on the
size of the standard
error.
It
is the
size of the
sample
itself,
the
sheer amount of information
available
(not
the
percentage
of
possible
information),
that
determines
the
accuracy of the results. Some extra accuracy is added (that
is, the
standard
error
will
be reduced)
if the sampling
fraction
(the
proportion of the population covered) exceeds 10% - but not
much. This
is just as well because real-life samples are often well
below 10%
-
especially,
of
course,
where
the
population
is
infinite (like all white mice) or expensive to sample from (say, the
testing *to destruction' of light bulbs).
So for practical purposes we can say that the standard error
of the mean depends on the size of the sample and
its standard
deviation. Standard error
will be smaller than the sample-SD.
How much smaller depends on the size of the sample. The larger

94
From sample to population
the sample, the greater the proportion by which standard error is
smaller than the standard deviation.
In fact, the standard error of the mean is calculated by dividing
sample-SD by the square root of the number of observations in
the sample. Thus a sample of 100 examination scores with a
standard deviation of, say, 15 marks would lead us to expect the
means of all such samples to have a standard error of:
1.5 marks = SE
VlOO
10
To halve the size of the standard error we'd need to quadruple
the sample size (from 100 to 400):
= 0.75 marks = SE
ViOO
20
The smaller the standard error, the more confident we can be that
our sample-mean
is close to the population-mean. But big
in-
creases in sample size produce relatively small improvements in
accuracy.
It seems to fly in the face of common sense that the size of the
population has
little effect on the accuracy (the standard error)
of the sample. Nevertheless
it is so. If the sample is big enough to
contain adequate information, don't worry about how small
it is
compared with the population. How to decide whether
it
is big
enough, we'll think about towards the end of this chapter.
Estimating the population-mean
So the standard error of the mean
is,
in
eff*ect, determined by
the size and standard deviation* of the sample. We can now say,
for example, that the range: P-mean Â±1
/^^!^"^-^
^
'
^
V sample size
that
is, P-mean Â± 1 SE
Strictly speaking, SE should be determined by the standard deviation of
the population rather than of the sample. But, with samples of about 30 or
more,
it is safe to use S-SD as an estimate of P-SD.

Estimating the population-mean
95
would contain about 68% of all sample means. But what use
is
this? All we have is one sample-mean. How do we use it to make
an inference about the size of the population mean ?
Here
is how:
look
at
the diagram
below, which shows a
distribution of sample-means. The distance of
1 SE is marked off
on
either
side of the P-mean. (68% of
ail sample-means
fall
within this range.)
Think about
all those S-means in the range P-mean Â±
1 SE.
(I've
indicated two 'specimens,' Mi and
Mi.) For every such
S-mean,
the range S-mean Â±
1 SE will contain the population
mean. That
is, the population-mean will
lie within one SE either
side of any such sample-mean.
(I have drawn lines either side of
Mi and M2, equal
in length to
1 SE, and you'll notice that,
in
each case, one of the lines crosses the mid-point of the distribu-
tion, which
is P-mean.)
What about sample-means like M3 and M4? Would the range
S-mean Â±
1 SE contain the population-mean in their cases also?
(Draw
lines of
1 SE
in length on either side of M3 and M4
if
you wish to check.)
:|e
*
3|c
:|c
4c
*
As you'll see in the diagram above, M3 and M4 lie more than
1 SE
away from the population-mean. So a range of
1 SE either side
of such sample-means would not contain P-mean.

96
From sample to population
So long as an S-mean is no more than
1 SE away from P-mean,
the range S-mean Â±
1 SE will contain the P-mean. Now, we know
that about 68% of all sample-means (including M, and M2 above)
are no more than
1 SE away from the P-mean. Therefore, what-
ever the mean of any sample we happen to have taken, there is a
68%
probability
that
the range S-mean Â±
1 SE contains the
population-mean - and, of course, a 32% probability that it does
not.
Consider our random sample of 100 students' examination
marks: the mean mark
is 50 and the standard deviation
is 15. So
the standard error of the mean
is
=
! ^ =
1.5 marks. How
VlOO
10
would this help us estimate the mean mark of all students who
took that exam? Well, there is a 68% probability that the P-mean
lies within
1 SE of the S-mean. Thus, we can say that we are 68%
confident that the mean mark of the total population of students
lies between S-mean Â±1 SE = 50 Â±
1 .5 marks, which gives a
range of 48.5 to 51.5 marks. This range (or interval) would be
called the 68% confidence interval.
What
is the probability that the true mean
lies outside that
rather narrow range of marks ?
*
*
i|c
Â«
*
The probability that the true mean of the population lies outside
the range
is 32%. Since 48.5 to 51 .5 marks is the 68% confidence
interval, we can be equally confident
that 32% of
all sample
means will not fall within
it.
So our sample-mean does allow us to infer a population-mean
of 50 Â±
1.5 marks - but with only a 68% probability of being
right.
If we want
to be more confident
that our estimate
is
correct, we'll have to widen the confidence interval. For instance,
we could be considerably more confident that the population-
mean
lies between 50 i 3 marks. To increase our confidence in
our estimate, we have here widened the range (the confidence
interval) to 2 SEs either side of the sample-mean.

Estimating the population-mean
97
If we wanted to be practically 100% confident (99.7% anyway),
we'd say the population-mean lay between sample-mean Â± how
many SE? (Check back to the diagram on page 77 if you need a
hint.)
4c
4e
*
*
The range of S-mean Â± 3 SD should contain practically all the
sample-means (99.7% in fact). It is the 99.7% confidence interval.
So, if our sample of 100 students' marks gave a mean of 50 and a
standard error (not SD, remember) of 1.5 marks, we could be
99.7% certain that the true population-mean lay between
50 Â± 3 (1.5) = 50 Â± 4.5 = 45.5 to 54.5 marks.

BUT,
it could
still be that 50 was one of the 0.3% of sample-
means that lay outside that range. The probability is small but, as
Aristotle once remarked, even the improbable does sometimes
happen.
In
this context,
it would happen three times
in every
1,000 samples.
So we can make a wide estimate with a high degree of con-
fidence or more precise estimates with lower degrees of confidence.
In
fact, the two confidence
intervals most commonly used are
those of 95% and 99%.

According to the diagram above (i) the 95% confidence interval

(i) The 95% confidence interval
is S-mean Â± 2 SE.

confidence
interval
is S-mean Â± 2^

precisely, we
should say 1.96 SE and 2.58 SE, but the rounded numbers above
will serve our purposes well enough in this book.)
Let's
illustrate these confidence intervals by returning to our
sample of 50 pulse-rates which had a mean of 79.1
beats per
minute and a standard deviation of 7.6 beats per minute. What is
the true mean of the population (of nearly 1,000 students)? First
we calculate the standard error of means from such samples:

In other words, there is only one chance in twenty (5%) that the
true mean of the population
is less than 76.9 or more than 81.3
beats per minute.
If we felt that 95% certainty was not enough and we wanted to
be even more confident that the range we quoted included the
true population-mean, we might use the 99% confidence interval:
79.1 Â± 21(1.1)
= 76.35 to 81.85 beats per minute.
There
is only one chance in a hundred that the true mean
falls
outside this range. But remember,
if one hundred such samples
were taken, probability warns us to expect one of them to have a
mean from which we would wrongly
infer a population-mean
outside of this range.
Estimating other parameters
Other parameters of the population can be estimated from sample
statistics
in much
the same
way. One
parameter we
might
particularly wish to know is a proportion. This will be the case
when the characteristic we are interested in is a category-vsLriablQ,
say, whether or not a graduate
is unemployed.
For instance, we may be anxious to know what proportion of
students
leaving
colleges
last
year
are
still unemployed. The
proportion
in the whole population can be estimated from the
sample - but with a range of possible error indicated.
Again, the underlying idea is that, in a large number of samples,
the proportion of unemployed would vary from one to another -
0.19 in one, 0.23
in another, 0.21
in a third, and so on. But the
distribution of such samples would be approximately normal and
centered around the true proportion (perhaps 0.22 of last year's
graduates are unemployed). We can thus calculate the standard
ERROR OF THE PROPORTION. Howcver, sincc a single sample
will have no variability from which to estimate variability across
all samples, we use a diff"erent method of deciding standard error.
It is calculated from the sample by multiplying the proportion we
are interested
in by the proportion remaining, dividing by the
number of cases in the sample, and taking the square root.

100
From sample to population
Thus,
if a random sample of 100 ex-students shows that 20 of
them are unemployed (and 80 are not):
SE proportion = sj^^^^
V 100
= \/0.0016
=
004
So,
if we wanted to be 99% confident of the proportion of un-
employed among all the students who left college last year, we'd
say
the
proportion
lay
between:
0.2 Â±
2i(0.04) =
0.10
to
0.30.
So, as you see, even the 99% confidence interval
is very wide
with a proportion.
(It would have been even wider, as you can
check
yourself
if you
like
arithmetic,
had
the
proportion
of
unemployed
in the sample been nearer 50%.) We can say with
99% certainty only that the number of unemployed ex-students
in the population of, say, 5,000 ex-students
lies somewhere be-
tween 500 and
1,500. This
is quite a range of error and perhaps
too wide to be of any practical valus.
Unfortunately,
there
is only one way we could reduce the
width of that confidence interval (and
still be 99% certain). Can
you guess how we'd do it? (Check back to page 91
if you want a
clue.)
The only way we could narrow the range
is by taking a bigger
sample. But
it would have to be a much bigger sample to have
real
effect. Since the standard error
is mfluenced by only the
square root of sample size, a fourfold increase in the sample size
would only halve the confidence
interval. Thus, a sample
size
of 400 (in which 20% were unemployed) would lead us to expect
between
750
and
1,250 unemployed
ex-students among
the
population of 5,000.

an

(whether
into
a
category-
variable
or a
quantity-variable),
it can
be
worth conducting

Estimating other parameters
101
a
* pilot inquiry' to estimate the likely standard error.
If, with a
category-variable, the proportion approaches 50%, or
if, with a
quantity-variable, the standard deviation seems large, then you'll
need a bigger sample than otherwise.
Thus, a metallurgist might be happy to infer the breaking point
of a new alloy on the basis of a handful of specimens - because
they show little variability. However, the psychologist wishing to
generalize about
the breaking point of human
beings
(e.g.
in
their reaction to stress) might be unwilling to do so except after
observations of several hundred - because human beings are far
more various in their behavior than are lumps of metal.
In general,
if we want to be sure of estimating the mean or the
proportion within the population with a certain precision (for
example, Â± 5 or Â± 5%), and with a certain confidence level (for
example, 99%), we could work out how large a sample we'd need
to reduce the standard error to the necessary
level. Whether we
could afford to gather a sample of such size would, of course, be
another matter.
If the cost or danger of making
incorrect
in-
ferences would be high
(say,
in
testing a
potentially harmful
drug), we might just feel compelled to afford
it.
To sum up this chapter: whatever our sample and the statistics
we draw from that sample, we can never use them to say exactly
what the mean or proportion (or any other parameter) of the
population really
is. The bigger the sample and the less variable
its
observations
(or the more unevenly
divided between one
category and another), the more certain we can be. But we can
never pin down one figure with 100% certainty. Our best estimate
of the mean (or proportion) must have a range of uncertainty
around
it. And
it must be stated in terms of probability: there is
an X% likelihood that the true mean (or proportion, etc.)
falls
within such-and-such a range. Not very satisfactory, perhaps, but
the best we can do in the real world!

6. Comparing samples
In Chapter 5 we considered how to make inferences about a
population based on what we know of a single sample. We can
now consider another highly important area of statistical
in-
ference: looking at two (or more) different samples and asking
whether or not they imply a real difference in populations. This
is what
lies behind questions
like: 'Are
girls more
intelligent
than boys?' *Does treatment with the new drug help more patients
than would
the
standard
treatment?'
'Which
of
these
four
methods is the most effective way of teaching French?' 'Are the
costs of running model-X
car more
variable than those
of
running model-Y?'
From the same or different populations?
As an example, suppose we measure the blood-pressures of two
random samples of students, 50 males and 50 females. What can
these two random samples
tell us about the difference between
the blood-pressures of male and female students in general? Are
the samples so similar that we'd be justified
in lumping them
together and saying they are from the same population; or are
they so
different
that
they
signify two
different
populations?
(For instance,
in order to estimate a student's blood pressure,
would
it help to know that student's sex?)
Just suppose the distribution curves for our two samples looked
something like this:
M
blood-pressures
102

From the same or different populations ?
103
Would we be justified in thinking that both samples came from
the same population? That
is, would
it seem
likely
that
the
population of female blood-pressures has the same mean and
standard deviation as the population of male blood-pressures?
Why, or why not ?
*
*
*
*
*
Although the means are much the same in the two samples above,
the standard deviations are very
different. We know that the
standard
deviation of a sample (provided
it has 30 or more
members) can be taken as a reasonable estimate of the standard
deviation in the population from which that sample comes. So,
having
two
very
different
standard
deviations,
the
samples
pictured above would seem to come from different populations.
The population of male blood-pressures would appear to be more
variable than that of female blood-pressures.
Another, more difficult comparison arises, however, when the
standard deviation
is much the same
in each sample, but the
means differ. Look at the diagram below: it shows three different
Blood-pressures

104
Comparing samples
pairs of sample distributions. In each pair, the dispersion
(e.g.
standard deviation) of each sample
is the same. But the means
differ between the two samples in each pair.
In which of these cases (A, B or C) would you
feel
(i) most
confident and
(ii) least confident that the pair of samples came
from different populations ?
9|c

Hi
%

In each of the three pairs of samples, the means are different. In
(A) they are very different, in (B) they are much less different, and
in (C) they differ scarcely at all. Now, we know about the chance
factors of sampling variation, so we don't expect two random
samples drawn from the same population
to have exactly the
same mean. But we also know that we are more likely to draw
a pair of samples with means
fairly close together than a pair
whose means are far apart. (Do you remember the distribution of
possible sample-means on page 88?) Therefore, our chances of
choosing
pair (A), above, from a
single population are small
compared with our chances of choosing pair (B), and especially
small compared with our chances of choosing pair (C). So, to
look at
it the other way round, (A)
is the pair of samples I'd feel
most sure came from different populations. Similarly, (C)
is the
pair I'd feel least sure came from populations with different means.
So, given two samples with
similar dispersion
but
different
means, how do we decide whether or not they are from the same
population? Let's work
it out, using our blood-pressure example:
two random samples, 50 males and 50 females. Suppose the mean
male blood-pressure
is 120 mm, and the standard error of the
mean (calculated from the standard deviation of all 50 blood-
pressures)
is
1.6 mm. Knowing these
figures, we can
be 99%
confident that the population mean (and the mean of any other
sample of 50 from that population) would
lie within a clearly
defined range. There would be only one chance in a hundred of
getting a sample of 50 with a mean falling outside this range.
Just to remind yourself of what we discussed in Chapter 5:
How would you define this range: S-mean Â± how many SE?
Â«
Â«
He

From the same or different populations ?
105
We could be 99% confident that the population-mean
lies in the
range: S-mean Â± 2\ SE (or 2.58 SE, to be more precise). So the
population-mean lies in the range: 120 Â± 2^(1.6) mm. (If you're
a non-mathematician, as I'm assuming, you won't be offended
by my mixing vulgar fractions and decimals
in
this way!) So,
for
the
male
blood-pressures,
P-mean
lies
between
116
and 124 mm.
Similarly, if the sample of women's blood-pressures had a mean
of 110 mm and, let's say, the same standard deviation and there-
fore the same standard error of the mean, we could work out that
there was only one chance in a hundred of finding such a sample
with a mean
falling outside the range 106 to 114 mm; that
is,
S-mean dr 2i (1.6).
Let's put all these figures in a table, just to keep check on how
far we've come:
Sample
S-mean
Estimate of P-mean (99% level)
Males
120 mm
116 to 124 mm
Females
1 10 mm
106 to
1 14 mm
What can you conclude from this so far?:
(a) no woman will have higher blood-pressure than a man ? or
(b) very few women will have higher blood-pressure than a man ?
or
(c) no random samples of women will have a higher mean blood-
pressure than a similar sample of men? or
(d) very few random samples of women will have a higher mean
blood pressure than a similar sample of men?
:ic

*

:|c
Although there will be a considerable number of women who
have a higher blood-pressure than men, very few samples of fifty
women
(d)
will have a higher mean blood-pressure
than
fifty
men.
See how this looks on a diagram. (Strictly speaking, the curves
for the sampling distributions of the means should be infinitely
tall if they are to appear on the same chart as the sample-curves.

106
Comparing samples
After all, the area under each sample-curve is supposed to rejTre-
sent only 50 observations, while the sampling distributions of the
means
are supposed
to
represent
populations of
infinite
size.
However, although
they're
not
tall enough on
this
scale,
the
lower parts of those two curves are correctly shown; and
it is the
overlap at the base that we are chiefly interested in here.)
The area where female-mean may be
greater than male-mean
Blood-pressures (mm)
While there
is a considerable overlap between the two samples,
there
is scarcely any overlap between the two distributions of
possible sample-means.
We can
calculate
the
probability of picking out
a
pair of
samples
(one
female,
one
male)
in
which
the
female mean
equalled or exceeded the male.
In one
in
100 cases, we might
expect the men's mean to be outside the range
1 16 to 124. And in
one in 100 cases, the women's mean might be outside the range
106 to
114.
In only one out of 100 x
100 pairs of samples of
fifty would both means be outside the limits. So even that pos-
sibility
is extremely unlikely - one in 10,000 chances. But, even
then, the female mean might be low while the male
is high; or
both may be low; or both may be high; only when the female
mean
is high and the male mean low
is there a chance that the
female mean would exceed the male. We would therefore have
to take 4 x
10,000 samples to cover all these four equally pos-
sible eventualities. So the probability of picking out a pair of
samples of 50 in which the female mean exceeds the male mean is
less than ^ 1.^^ . It
is so small as to be negligible.

Significance testing
107
The
sample
statistics
(mean,
and
standard
deviation,
and
standard error) have signified a difference in the populations from
which the samples were drawn. We can be certain that the female
blood-pressures are, statistically speaking, drawn from a different
population than
the male blood-pressures. There
is a
reliable
and
* systematic*
difference between male and
female
blood-
pressure at this age.
Significance testing
When we compare samples in this way we are applying a test
OF SIGNIFICANCE. We are asking whether the
difference
be-
tween samples
is big enough to signify a real difference between
populations. (Whether such a difference, even
if real,
is in any
sense important,
is a matter we'll consider later.)
How exactly do we carry out a significance test? Tve already
illustrated one way, based on the likelihood of an overlap
be-
tween the distributions of sample means. A more common ap-
proach, however,
is to think
in terms of a distribution of
DIFFERENCES between
means. At
first,
this
idea may
strain
your imagination even more than did that of a distribution of
sample-means! But you'll soon find
it makes sense.
Suppose we consider a population
(e.g. the blood-pressures
of male students) and draw samples of, say, 100 from
it. Let's
say we draw two random samples at a time - call them A and B.
Naturally, we would not rely on the mean of sample A being the
same as the mean of sample B. Most often, perhaps, they would
be the same; but quite often mean-A would be slightly bigger
than mean-B, or vice versa; and occasionally, mean-A would be
considerably bigger than mean-B, or vice versa. If we compared
an infinite number of pairs of reasonably large samples from this
population, we
could
form
a
frequency
distribution
of
the
differences between
pairs of S2irc\p\t-means.
In other words, we
are
asking:
With what
frequency
does mean-A
considerably
exceed mean-B? How often does
it slightly exceed it? How often
are
the two means equal? How
often
does mean-B
slightly

108
Comparing samples
exceed mean-A ? How often does it exceed considerably ? And so
on.
This
is to say, a difference between means
is another statistic
- this time descriptive of two samples, rather than one. As with
other
statistics, we can thus start thinking about
its
* sampling
distribution
What would be the distribution of this statistic in an
infinite number of such pairs of equally sized samples? Can you
imagine what shape this distribution would have? Can you guess
what
its mean would be ?

The distribution of differences between
the means of pairs of
samples from
the same
population would
be
approximately
normal. (This would be so even
if the distribution of the popula-
tion itself were not normal.) The mean of the distribution would
be zero - overall, the A-means would exceed the B-means as often
and by the same amount as the B-means exceeded the A-means;
small differences would be more frequent than big ones. Here is
the distribution curve:

This distribution curve takes a little getting used to. Although
it looks like any other normal curve,
it has one very distinctive
feature of its own: the base-line does not simply, as with previous
curves, represent larger and larger quantities as we read from

Significance testing
109
left to right. Instead, the quantities (differences between means)
start large on the left. Then, as we read towards the right, they
diminish to zero (in the middle) and then start to increase until
the maximum on the extreme right matches that on the extreme
left. (You may wonder why we don't simplify things by laying
the
left-hand
side
on
top
of
the
right and
have a skewed
curve with a normal base-line running from 0 to maximum. But
you'll see
later that we need to
identify the direction of a
dif-
ference - which mean
is bigger than which - as well as the size.)
The center-point of the distribution
(the mean) represents the
frequency of pairs of samples with zero difference between their
means. (50% of pairs should have mean-A bigger than mean-B;
while in the other 50% of sample pairs, mean-B should be bigger
than mean-A.)
Suppose we take three pairs of samples from this population.
The means (in mm) happen to be as follows:
(i)
sample A-mean =118, sample B-mean =120;
(ii)
sample A-mean =
121, sample B-mean =120;
(iii) sample A-mean =
121, sample B-mean =
122.
How big is the difference between the means of the two samples
in each case? Will each difference belong on the left- or the right-
hand side of the distribution ? Which of the three differences will
be furthest from the center (the mean) of the distribution?
*
:|c
:|c
4e
*
*
In
(i), sample B's mean
is 2 mm bigger than sample A's, so
it
belongs on the right-hand side of the distribution. In (ii), sample
A's mean
is
1 mm bigger than the B-mean; so that difference
belongs on the left-hand side. In
(iii), sample B's mean
is
1 mm
bigger than sample A's mean, so that difference belongs on the
right-hand side. The biggest of the three differences between the
sample-means
is in pair
(i), so that
is the difference that will be
furthest from the mean in the distribution.
This, then,
is the sort of theoretical distribution we'd expect
from the differences between the two means of a huge number of
pairs of samples drawn from
the same
population.
It
is
the

110
Comparing samples
'sampling distribution' of the differences between
means. The mean would
be
zero, and
the
dispersion would
depend on the amount of dispersion
in the population. That
is,
the
greater
the
variability
within
the
population,
the more
variable the samples would be and the greater the likelihood of
widely differing means.
The dispersion in the distribution of differences between sample-
means can
be measured
in standard
deviation
units. As with
the
distribution
of
sample-means,
this
standard
deviation
is
known as the standard error - this time the standard error
OF the differences between means (SE-diff). Hence,
all
the proportions of the normal curve can be assumed; that
is,
about 68% of all differences between sample-means will
lie be-
tween 0 Â±
1 SE-diff; about 95% will
lie between 0 Â± 2 SE-diff,
and so on.

Very few (0.3%) of differences will be bigger than 3 x SE-diff.
Now,
let's see how
all this helps in an actual situation. How
would
it apply in comparing our two samples of blood-pressures ?
Right from the start, you'll remember, we noticed that the mean

Significance testing
111
blood-pressure of the 50 men students was 10 mm higher than
that of the 50 women. What we wanted to know was whether this
difference was significant. That
is, was
it big enough to signify (or
indicate)
a
difference
in
blood-pressure
between
such
men
students and women students
in general? Or
is
this difference
between the sample-means just one that we'd anyway expect to
arise quite often by chance? To decide this we carry out a test
of significance.
Now scientists are expected to be cautious - especially about
evidence that might seem to support their theories. (As Charles
Darwin once said:
'I always make special notes about evidence
that
contradicts
me:
supportive
evidence
I
can
remember
without
trying!') So statisticians have developed an especially
cautious
convention.
The
convention
is
that we
test
for
a
significant difference by asking:
* Could
it be that the difference is
not significant?'
So we start out as
if assuming that there
is no real difference
between the blood-pressures of men and women. We assume, in
effect,
that
they are
all from
the same
population. Thus,
the
difference between the means of our two samples would be just
one possible difference from the theoretical distribution above,
where the mean difference is zero. This assumption, or hypothesis,
is called the null hypothesis. (It attempts to nullify the dif-
ference between the two sample-means by suggesting
it
is of no
statistical significance.)
From this point on, the null hypothesis is
* under assault." If the
difference between
the two sample-means turns out
to be too
big to be explained away as the kind of variation that would often
occur by chance between random samples, then we must
reject
it.
It
will not explain our findings. We shall have to replace
it
with
an
alternative
hypothesis.
The
most
usual
alternative
hypothesis would be simply that the two population-means are
not equal.
This
is not the only possible alternative hypothesis, of course.
Can you think of another, perhaps one
that would
be more
precise?
He

Comparing samples
Another
alternative hypothesis might be
that the mean male
blood-pressure is higher than the female mean, or vice versa. (You
might even hazard that one was higher than the other by at least
some specified amount, e.g. 5 mm.)
Anyway, the null hypothesis (that there
is no real difference
between the P-means)
is assumed true until - and unless - the
difference between S-means proves too big for us to believe easily
that both samples could have come from the same population.
So we are assuming that the difference of 10 mm between the
means of the two samples of blood-pressures is just one difference
from a normal distribution of differences between the means of
such samples.
The mean of the distribution
is zero. What
is the standard
deviation - the standard error of the mean of the difference?
Of course, without taking an infinite number of pairs of samples,
we can't know for certain. So we have to estimate the standard
error of the difference between sample-means (just as we estimated
the standard error of a mean). In fact, the standard error of the
difference between means
is found by combining the standard
errors of the two means.
In the case of our two blood-pressure samples, the standard
deviation of the fifty values in each sample happens to be the same
(1 1.3 mm). Therefore the standard error of the mean in each case
is also the same:
^Ij = 1.6 mm.
V50
In fact, we square the two standard errors, add them together and
take the square root (so the SE-diff must always be larger than
either of the SE-means)
SE-diff = Vl.6^ + 1.6^

Following the null hypothesis
(i.e. assuming these two samples
come from
the same
population),
then a
distribution of the
differences between the means of pairs of such samples would

So, even if there were no real difference between male and female
blood-pressures, we could
expect
that
in
a hundred
pairs of
samples, 68 would differ in mean by up to 2i mm. Sometimes the
male means would be up to 1\ mm bigger than the female, some-
times vice versa. But such a difference, one way or the other, would
68

ference

we'd certainly have assumed
it was just the result of random,
chance variations
in sampling - far too likely an occurrence to
signify a real difference in the population means.
What would be the probability of the means of two randomly
chosen samples differing by more than 1\ mm? (Check with the

As we'd expect of a normal

the distribution's area lies within Mean Â± 2 SD). So, m the case
of our
pairs of blood-pressure
samples,
the
probability
of a
difference in means of 2 x SE-diff (i.e. 2 x 2.26 mm = 4.52 mm)
is about
or one in twenty. (Remember that, of course, this
luu
one pair could have the female mean bigger than the male, or
vice versa.)
Similarly, we know that Mean Â± 2\ SD covers about 99% of
the normal curve. So,
if there actually
is no real difference be-
tween male and female blood-pressures
in general, a difference
between means
as
big
as 2^ x 2.26 mm = 5.65 mm can
be
expected
in only one pair of samples
in a hundred (1% proba-
bility). (Again, female bigger than male mean, or vice versa.)
What would be the probability of a pair of samples in which the
male mean was at least 5.65 mm bigger than the female mean?

Since the probability of either male exceeding female or female
exceeding male mean by
that amount
is
(or 1%, or 0.01),
then the probability of a particular one of these alternatives
is
half of that:
or i% or 0.005.

Difference between pairs of sample-means
Perhaps
it's time we thought again about our two samples of
blood-pressures and
our
null
hypothesis. We
said
that
we'd
assume the samples both came from one population - unless the
difference in their means turned out to be so large that we could
not account for
it in terms of chance variations among samples
from a single population.
Well, the distribution above shows the frequency with which
we'd expect
the means of
pairs of such samples
to
differ by
various amounts (if they came from the same population).
Our two sample-means differed by 10 mm. Would
this be a
very
likely occurrence? Would
it
lead you
to accept
the
null
hypothesis (no real difference), or to reject
it ?

116
Comparing samples
A difference of 10 mm would not be very likely. We know that
even a difference of 3 x SE-diff would be bigger than 99.7% of
all such differences. But here we have one of 4 x
SE-diff. The
probability of so large a difference could be calculated (using the
normal curve tables) as
less than six chances in a thousand - so
small that we can safely discount the possibility. This means we
can
reject
the
null
hypothesis. The
difference
between
these
samples signifies a real difference between the populations (young
men's and young women's
blood-pressures). The difference
is
significant - very, very significant, some people might say.
The significance of significance
At
this point
I'll
just remind you
that,
in
statistical
thinking,
'significant'
does
not
necessarily
imply
* interesting'
or
'im-
portant.' For instance, suppose we compare a new method of
teaching geography with an old method. The mean exam mark of
students taught with
the new method
is,
let's
say, 66%, while
that of a similar sample taught by the old method
is 60%.
If
the samples are large enough, we can establish that this difference
is significant. But
all we are saying
is
that we
believe the
dif-
ference to be real, that we believe the new method has put students
into a different population from that of the old method - one
with a
slightly higher mean examination mark. We anticipate
that some such
difference would be replicated
in
future com-
parisons between pairs of samples from these two populations.
('Reliable' would probably be a more appropriate word to use
than
'significant' -
but
it's no doubt too
late
to change
the
vocabulary of statisticians now!)
Notice that we are not making any value judgements. We are
not saying that the difference is worth striving for (or even worth
having - geography teachers' reaction to a difference of 6% may
well be 'So what!'). We are certainly not saying that the new
method (and
it might just as easily be a new drug-treatment
in
medicine or a new production-process
in
industry) should be
adopted
in place of the old. This has to be decided on other

The significance of significance
117
(non-statistical) grounds, such as: how much does it cost (say, in
time and resources) to achieve such a difference? And, would yet
other methods achieve bigger differences at less cost ?
Which of the following two differences would you say
is the
more significant, statistically speaking:
(a) The mean sentence-length in novels by author X
is 3 words
longer than in those of author Y ; this difference is calculated
as being equivalent to 2^ x SE-diff.
(b) The survival-rate among patients given a certain operation is
20% higher than that among patients judged to be in need of
such an operation but who, for various reasons, have not
been able to have
it. This difference
is calculated
as, being
equivalent to 2 x SE-diff.
*
*
4c
*
*
*
Statistically speaking, the more significant difference is that in (a).
That is to say,
it appears that a difference of 3 words per sentence
is less likely to happen by chance than
is a difference of 20% in
survival rate - in the samples compared. Note that
it
is not the
social or human value of the difference we are looking at (nor
even its absolute size) - only how big it is m terms of the standard
error
of
such
differences
(as
indicated
by
variability
in
the
samples to which
it relates).
(Remember: the more variable the values in a population, the
more variable
will be the values observed
in samples. And the
more variable the samples, the more variable will be their means -
and the more variable will be the differences between the means
from pairs of such samples. And the greater the variability all along
the chain, the bigger the difference between means we'd need to
convince us that our two samples did not come from the same
population.)
So, a 'significant' difference is one that signifies a real difference
in populations. But how big does a difference have to be in order
to count as significant? Now this
is a bit
like asking: *How big
do people have to be to count as "tall"?' There
is always some-
thing rather arbitrary about drawing a line at a certain value and

118
Comparing samples
saying that values on one side of
it are significant and on the
other
side are not
significant.
Nevertheless, two such
'cut-off
points' are commonly used by
statisticians. These are the 5%
level and the 1%
level (often written as the 0.05
level and the
0.01
level).
It may not be obvious at
first glance, but a diff*erence
is less
significant if it is at the 0.05 level than if it is at the 0.01
level. That
is, we may accept a
diff'erence as
significant
if
it could have
occurred by chance (from a single population) in only five pairs
of samples
in every hundred, or we may
insist that
it should
be so
large
that
it could
have occurred
in
only one
pair of
samples
in a hundred. (We can
relate
this
to
the confidence
levels we discussed
in the
last chapter:
in the
first case we are
95% confident that
the
diff'erence
is a
real one;
in the second
case we are 99% confident.)
So,
if we are going to reject the null hypothesis, we will do so
more confidently
if the diff'erence between our sample-means
is
significant (a) at the 1% level? or (b) at the 5% level? Which?
4e
*
Â«
4t
Â«
Â«
Â«
The bigger the diff'erence, the more confidently we can reject the
null hypothesis (that there is no real diff'erence between the means
of the populations from which the samples are drawn). To be
significant at the 1% level (one chance in 100 of so large a dif-
ference), the diff'erence must be bigger than
if it were significant
only at the 5% level (five chances in 100). So we'd reject the null
hypothesis more confidently with a diff'erence significant at the
1% level.
A diff'erence that
is significant at the 5% level
is often merely
called
* significant'; while a diff'erence significant at the 1% level
is
called
* highly
significant'; (and
at 0.1%
level
*very
highly
significant'). However, these verbal labels really add nothing to
what
is shown
in the figures - though they may make the re-
searcher
feel
happier
that he has produced something worth
while.
For
instance,
suppose
two
related
experiments
each
produced a difference, one that would have a 4.9% chance of
arising merely because of sampling variation, and the other a

5.1% chance. In fact, these two experiments would seem to be in
very close agreement about the presence of a real difference; yet
in one case
it would be labelled
* significant' and
in the other
'not
significant'
(or,
at
best, 'almost
significant'). Perhaps,
in
evaluating such
data,
it
is
better to
let the
figures speak
for
themselves.
Let's return to our samples of blood-pressures. How large a
difference of means would we have needed for it to be significant
at the 5% level? And how large a difference for 1% significance?
Â«
Â«
:|c
Â«
Â«
*
Â«
A
difference
is
significant
at the 5%
level
if
it
is bigger than
2 X SE-diff. (In this case, 2 x SE-diff = 4i mm.) To be signifi-
cant at the 1% level
it must be at least 2i x SE-diff (i.e. 5f mm).
If the difference had been less than 4i mm, we could not have
rejected
the
null
hypothesis.
It would
simply have
been
too
probable that the difference was due to sampling variations from
within one
population.
In
effect, we'd
be
accepting
the
null
hypothesis - agreeing that a real difference has not been proved.
The difference would not be significant.
So,
in significance testing, there are two opposite risks. First,
one may accept a difference as significant when
it
is not. This is
called a type
i error. We guard against this by demanding a
more stringent level of significance (say, 1% rather than 5%). But,
as we
increase the significance
level
(asking
for a
bigger
dif-
ference between the sample-means), we increase our risk ofmaking
the opposite error.
Can you see what this opposite error would be?

If we ask for a bigger difference between sample-means before
we'll accept that there
is a difference between the populations,
then the more likely
it
is that we'll
fail to recognize a difference
as being real, even when
it
is. This
is the type
ii error.
In short: Type I error is to reject the null hypothesis when
it is
true; Type
II error
is to accept the null hypothesis when
it
is
false. We can picture
it like this:

OUR
DECISION
However,
since there
is no way of knowing whether the
null
hypothesis
is 'really' true or false, we can never tell which of the
above boxes our decision puts us in. What we can tell
is that the
more we reduce our risk of making a Type
I error (by demanding
*more significant' differences), the more we
... (a) reduce? or (b)
increase?
... our risk of making a Type II error. Which?
4c
:ic
4c
a|c
*
*
4c
The more we reduce our risk of making Type T errors the more we
increase (b) our risk of Type
II errors. The more and more con-
fident we wish to be that we are not going to claim a real
dif-
ference when there is none, the bigger the difference we'll demand
between our samples. But the more we decrease our probability
of being wrong in this way, the bigger the differences we'll have
decided to disbelieve as indicators of real population differences.
And, because of the increasing probability that some of these
sample-differences will represent real population-differences, the
greater our chance of overlooking them and saying two samples
are from the same population when in fact they are not.
There
is a clear parallel between
this dilemma and that
in-
volved in the use of evidence in a court of law. If we are prepared
to accept rather weak evidence of a person's guilt, then we'll risk
punishing a
lot of innocent
people.
Conversely,
if we
ignore
anything but the strongest possible evidence, then a number of
guilty people will go unpunished.
What does
all this mean
in practical terms? If the researcher
is very strict in his choice of a significance level, he can be pretty
confident of the reality of any differences he does recognize; but

The significance of significance

he may miss many promising possibilities that might have been
worth following up with further investigations. On the other hand,
if he is lenient in his choice of significance level, he'll be catching
all those promising leads, but he may also draw attention to a
number of diff"erences on which he (and colleagues influenced by
his findings) may subsequently spend a lot of research time and
resources, before deciding that the diff'erence was due merely to
sampling
variation
after
all. We can imagine how
this might
apply,
say, to some branch of cancer
research where
nothing
approaching a cure has yet been discovered but where the costs
of research are extremely high. No doubt the temptation to follow
up every faint possibility of a cure would be constantly at odds
with the desire to concentrate scarce resources on investigating
only the most promising leads (and to avoid raising false hopes
among doctors and suff'erers). If the costs of a Type
I error (re-
jecting the null hypothesis and mistakenly claiming a real
dif-
ference) could be expected to be high, researchers would demand
a
stringent
significance
level - certainly 1% and maybe even
To%

it
all depends on the circum-
stances.
Such procedures may seem arbitrary and untidy. But there
is
no such thing as absolute 100% proof in science (or out of it). All
we have
is probability and
levels of confidence. People with a
claim to be scientists are simply more honest about
it than others
-
at
least when they are acting scientifically. The risk of error
is quantified and stated. We can never know for certain if we have
made a Type
I or a Type II error, though further experiments or
inquiries may reduce
the
uncertainty. But
the conventions of
science are conservative. They demand
significance
levels
that
ensure we are far more likely to fail to claim a result that (un-
known to us) would have been justified, than to claim a result that
is illusory.
So the emphasis
is on avoiding errors of which type - I or II?

Comparing samples
Comparing dispersions
Before we go on to the final section of this chapter, here
is a
reminder: we've talked mostly about samples differing in mean.
But they can also differ in dispersion (that
is, in standard devia-
tion, or variance).
1 showed you this diagram at the beginning of
the chapter:
In this diagram, the two samples do not differ much in mean. But
they do differ considerably in dispersion. Sample Y is much more
spread out, much more variable
in
its values, much more dis-
persed, than sample X. There will be a big difference between the
standard deviations of these samples.
Can a difference
in
dispersion between two samples be big
enough to signify that they come from different populations? Yes,
it can. You'll not be surprised to learn that there are ways of
testing the significance of a difference in dispersion - but you'll
no doubt be pleased to hear that we're not going to look into
them! The difference
in
dispersion
pictured above would
cer-
tainly prove significant; that
is, those samples could be assumed
to come from two populations differing in variance (though not
much in mean).
There are many situations in which we might wish to compare
dispersion (e.g. standard deviations) rather than, or as well
as,
means.
For
example,
anxiety
or
certain
kinds
of drug
(for
example, alcohol) may make some people in a sample better at
performing a certain task, while making some worse. Thus, while
the mean performance
in
the sample might
not
differ much
before and after taking the drug, the variability of performance,
or dispersion, might well have increased significantly.
As a matter of fact, the significance test we've been discussing
so far in this chapter (for the difference in means) does actually

Comparing dispersions
123
depend on an assumption about the dispersion in the samples:
it
assumes
that
the
pair
of samples
are
sufficiently
similar
in
standard deviation to indicate that they come from populations
of equal dispersion. The greater the difference in standard devia-
tion (or variance) between two samples, the less accurately can we
establish the significance of the difference between their means.
For example, in which of the three pairs of samples illustrated
below would we apply our
test for the significance of the
dif-
ference between means ? And in which would we not ? Why ?
i|e
4c
*
*
The test
is effective only on the assumption that dispersion
is
about equal in the two samples. This is the case only in pair (B)
above. So that is the case in which we'd test for the significance
of the
difference between
the means.
In
case (C) above,
the
means of the two samples clearly do
differ. However, our test
would not give an accurate idea of the significance of this dif-
ference, because the dispersions are also widely
different. Nor
would
it in (A), for the same reason.
When two samples differ in both mean i7Â«^/ standard deviation,
it may be sensible to compare the dispersions
first.
If the
dis-
persions turn out to be significantly
different, then
it may be
safer to
assert
that
the samples probably do come from
dif-
ferent
populations - and
leave
it
at
that.
In
other words,
it
might not be worth carrying out a further
test of significance
because of the difficulty of separating differences
in mean from
differences
in
dispersion.
However,
we're
getting
into
deep
theoretical waters, here - where even
professional
statisticians
may disagree as to what is acceptable practice. So let's move on.

124
Comparing samples
Non-parametric methods
I wonder
if
it's occurred to you that the
statistical techniques
we've been talking about seem heavily dependent on the normal
curve of distribution? If not, just flip through the pages of this
book and notice how that bell-shaped curve appears over and
over again -
tall and
thin, short and
fat, and
all
states
in be-
tween.
It
is a
fact that most of the
* classical'
statistical
tech-
niques assume that samples are drawn from normally distributed
populations and allow us
to estimate the parameters of such
populations. Hence, such techniques are called 'parametric'
But there are many cases where we would definitely be wrong
to assume a population
is normal in distribution. And there are
yet more cases where we may be wrong but can't be sure. For
instance, the idea of a normal
distribution
is inappropriate to
category-data. Suppose we
are
interested
in
the employment
chances of our
' honors ' and
' ordinary
' graduates. We check up
on a hundred of each, one year after graduation, and find that
90 of the honors
graduates
are employed
as
are 80 of the
ordinary graduates. By a method
I'll be describing
in the next
chapter,
it is possible to show that there are less than five chances
in a hundred that such would be the proportions if honors
and
ordinary graduates, in general, are equally likely to be employed.
That
is, we can
reject
the
null
hypothesis
(at
the 0.05
level,
anyway). There seems to be a systematic 'non-chance' diff"erence
between the two categories of graduate as far as employment
is
concerned.
But have we made any assumptions about whether employ-
ment is normally distributed?
iti
*
*
*
*
*
Of course we have made no assumptions about the distribution of
employment. We have not even measured the amount of em-
ployment enjoyed by any individual graduates.
Nevertheless,
without
any
such
assumptions,
and
without
calculating means and standard deviations, we are able to test for
the significance of a diff'erence in such category-data. This, then,

Non-parametric methods
1 25
is a NON-PARAMETRIC TEST -
it Can Operate without assump-
tions about the normality of a distribution.
Another
* category'
occasion
when
only
non-parametric
techniques can be used
is
if our data consists of ranks. This is
when we know which members of a sample are ranked
1st, 2nd,
3rd, 4th, etc.
(e.g.
in beauty,
intelligence, charm, or whatever).
Here the sample members are arranged
in order according to
*how much' of the relevant characteristic they are deemed to
have. However,
these ordered categories may
well have been
arrived at without any quantity-measurements having been made.
For instance, suppose the students in a college department have
arranged the five senior members and four junior members of
staff in order of what they regard as their
* teaching ability
Since
no quantity-measurements have been made, there
is no way we
can average the teaching ability of each group and ask whether
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the mean
'teaching
ability' of junior and senior staff. All we know
is that the rank
order from
best
to worst teacher
is as follows (where S
is a
senior teacher and J is a junior):
best.
.
.
... worst
1st
2nd
3rd
4th
5th
6th
7th
8th
9th
S
S
S
J
J
S
S
J
J
However,
there
is a non-parametric
technique
(the Mann-
Whitney U test) that would allow us to compare this order with
the order we might expect
if seniors and juniors were equally
competent (e.g. sjsjsjsjs) - and, in this case, conclude that the
order we have found
is not significantly different.
Such
non-parametric
tests
are
usually
relatively
simple
to
calculate. Consequently, researchers often use them as
'short-
cut' (or 'quick-and-dirty') methods, even when they have a full
set of measurements and can also assume a normal curve. For
instance, they may reduce a set of individual scores on examina-
tions to the numbers of students passing or failing. Alternatively
they may forget about the actual scores and simply work on the
rank order of the scores.
Naturally, this results in information about the real differences

126
Comparing samples
between the members of the samples being lost. For instance, the
exam scores of two male students may be 100 and 10, and those
of two females may be 90 and 80. So, the male ranks are 1st and
4th, while the female are 2nd and 3rd. The mean rank
is 2i in
each case.
It seems that women and men did equally well in the
exam,
if we go by rank-positions alone. But can we still believe
in this 'no difference'
if we look back at the actual scores made
by the men and the women ?
s|Â»
9|c
^
^
^
^
Well,
the two women made a
total
of 90 + 80 = 170,
while
the men's total was 100 + 10 =
110. Knowing the actual scores
has enabled us to see the superiority of the women. But this was
hidden when our only information concerned ranks.
So, when we lose detailed information by reducing measured
data to a few categories (e.g. pass/fail) or by using rank-positions
only, we hide differences. This means we have more difficulty in
detecting differences that are significant. Therefore, to put
it the
other way round, non-parametric tests require differences to be
much
bigger
if they
are
to
be accepted
as
significant.
Thus,
although non-parametric techniques are comparatively simple to
apply
to most
statistical
inquiries (and must be used
in some
because
parametric
techniques
are
inappropriate),
they
do
increase the risk that we'll accept the null hypothesis when
it
is
false (Type II error).
Perhaps
that's enough of a digression on non-parametric
methods. They are very important to the practicing statistician,
and
I'll be mentioning one such method in each of the following
two chapters. But statistics
is,
I believe, best explained from the
parametric tradition. So the normal distribution will continue to
dominate in the remainder of our discussion.
You've probably found
this the most taxing chapter
in the
book so
far. Thinking up a theoretical distribution beyond the
observed facts; juggling with what seem like the double negatives
of the null hypothesis - setting up a result you don't expect just
so
that you can
demonstrate
its
improbability and
thus
in-
directly vindicate an alternative result you expected all along and

Non-parametric methods
127
might just as well have set out to test directly ; expressing the signi-
ficance of the result in terms of the probability of its being wrong
rather than in terms of being correct:
all these may make signi-
ficance testing seem a weird form of mental gymnastics. None the
less,
it is at the core of statistical method.
In the next chapter
I'll
give you a chance to improve your
*feer for significance by taking you, step by step, through a case
study in which we'll apply a significance test to an experimental
comparison. Meanwhile, if you feel the need to skim through this
chapter again before starting on the next,
I shan't be in the least
surprised. In fact, I'd warmly recommend it!

7. Further matters of significance
In this chapter I want to apply significance testing, step by step,
to a new problem. In the process
Til introduce a controversial
aspect that I've avoided so
far. We'll then go on to deal with
more than two samples at once. And we'll end up by considering
ways of testing the significance between diff'erences in category-
as well as quantity-variables.
Let us suppose we have developed a
* memory drug' which we
hope will help students do better in examinations - and, whatever
other
qualities
they
test,
examinations
still
do make
heavy
demands on the memory. We want to know whether students can
expect to benefit from taking the memory drug.
We select two random samples, each of 100, from among the
students taking a particular examination. Just before they enter
the examination room we
give
the
* experimental' group
the
'memory
pill.' The other sample of 100
is used
as a 'control
group.' We give them a 'placebo' - a
pill which looks like the
real thing but
in fact does not contain the drug we are testing.
All 200
students
are
told
they have been
given
the memory
drug. (This
is to guard against students
in the drug group per-
forming diff'erently, not because of the drug, but simply because
they have been picked out for special treatment.)
Now, what diff'erence will the drug make to the examination
grades of our two samples? (Of course,
we'll have to make
sure the tests are marked by teachers who are not aware of
which students did and did not receive the drug; we wouldn't
want to risk their marking being affected by such knowledge.
This
is called a 'double-blind' in experimental design; neither
observed nor observer knows who
is who!)
Ultimately, we'll
want to generalize from the apparent effect on these particular
students to its possible effect on other such students in future.

One- versus two-tailed tests
129
But
first, we'll be interested
in the mean examination scores
of our two samples.
What should be our null hypothesis about these means?
:fc
*
Hi
The null hypothesis (which we'll hope to find untenable!)
is that
there
is no
significant
difference
between
the mean
score
of
students who took the drug and of those who did not. (This
is
tantamount
to suggesting that whatever difference appears,
it
might have arisen by chance, without our drug having had any
effect.)
How large a difference are we looking for? Well, let's say there
is a good deal of scepticism among our colleagues as to whether
such a pill will work. So we feel we can't reject the null hypothesis
if the difference turns out to be significant merely at the 5% level.
It won't be very convincing
if the chance of being wrong
is as
great as one in twenty.
So we decide we need a difference that
is significant at the 1%
level
if we are to be able to justify further work on the memory
drug. This way,
we'll be looking for a bigger difference - the
chances that we'll claim a difference as significant when
it
isn't
will be down to one in a hundred. Only at the 1% level will we
say that the alternative hypothesis seems reasonable and worth
pursuing.
One- versus two-tailed tests
But what
is the alternative hypothesis? Here we touch upon a
controversial issue that has been rumbling away in the background
of statistics for more than a quarter of a century. Shall our alter-
native hypothesis be merely that there is a significant difference,
or shall we be more specific and assert that the significant
dif-
ference
lies
in
a
particular
direction! To
be
blunt,
shall we
hypothesize
that
the
*drug'
students
will
score
significantly
higher than the
* placebo' students? This,
after
all,
is what we
have been hoping and working for. (There are no grounds, after
all,
for expecting a difference to favor the 'placebo' students.)

130
Further matters of significance
What
does
it
matter
whether
our
alternative
hypothesis
specifies simply
*a
significant
difference' or *a
significant
dif-
ference
in
a
specified
direction'?
Well,
think of
it m
betting
terms,
in terms of probability:
Which of these two forecasts (a) or (b) is more likely to be correct:
(a)
either the drug students will score significantly better than the
placebo
students,
or
else
the
placebo
students
will
score
significantly better than the drug students? or
(b)
the drug
students
will
score
significantly
better than
the
placebo students?
:ic

4c
*
*
4:

The more likely proposition
is in (a). After all,
it mentions two
possible outcomes, and (b) mentions only one of them. (A bettor
who says 'horse X or horse Y will be first past the post'
is more
likely to win than one who mentions horse X only.)
So,
if we say in advance that we are looking not simply for a
real
diff'erence but
for a
significant
diff'erence
in
favor of the
*drug' students, we would appear to be reducing our chances of
success! In fact, we'll make up for this. Let's see how.
If our alternative hypothesis had simply been 'there will be
a diff'erence that
is significant at the 1%
level,' we'd have been
looking for a diff'erence big enough to occur in one or other of the
two
tails of the theoretical
distribution of the
diff'erences that
could
be expected even
if students were
unaff'ected
by
being
given the drug or a placebo.
As we did with the comparison of blood-pressure means (where
we had no reason to suspect the diff'erence would
lie in a par-
ticular direction), we'd be using a two-tailed test of signi-
ficance.
To reject the null hypothesis (of no significant difference) we'd
have required the difference to be so big that there'd be no more
than half a chance
in a hundred of getting a *drug' mean this
much bigger than a 'placebo' mean, and no more than half a
chance
in a hundred of getting a 'placebo' mean
this much
bigger than a 'drug' mean,
if the 'two' populations really were

one. So the 'critical' VALUES would have been all those that
were at least 2\ times the SE-diff (since we know that about 99%
of the differences will be less than 1{ SE-diff).

Drug-mean score bigger than

Difference between two groups in mean exam-score
But that would have been a two-tailed test - appropriate when
we have no expectations about the direction of the difference.
This
time, however, we are posing a more
specific alternative
hypothesis. We are saying that we will not reject the null hypo-
thesis (and accept the alternative) unless the difference
in favor
of the 'drug' students
is so big that
it would have no more than
1% chance of being due to sampling variation.
In
fact, we are
about
to use a one-tailed test. We are
interested only
in
differences where the 'drug' students' mean exceeds that of the
'placebo' students (and not vice versa).
So, instead of taking the i% of differences that would
lie in the
left-hand tail together with the i% from the right-hand
tail, we
choose to take the whole l%from one tail - the tail where 'drug'

132
Further matters of significance
means would exceed 'placebo' means. (In this case,
it happens to
be the right-hand tail.) We'll reject the null hypothesis only if we
get a difference that would be in that right-hand 1%.
How large must a difference in favor of the
'drug' students be
if
it
is to
fall
in that biggest I/i of all such differences? (Check
with the curves above.)
(a) Must
it be 2i SE-diff? or
(b) Can
it be less than 2i SE-diff? or
(c) Must
it be more than 2i SE-diff?
He
4e
*
*
We'll be looking for a difference in favor
of the
* drug' students
of (b) less than 2\ SE-diff. In other words,
if 2\ SE-diff is about
the size of difference that cuts off i% from the right-hand tail, we
can see that enlarging that slice to take in an extra i% will push
the cut-off point back along the
base-line, implying a smaller
difference.
273 SE-diff
If we look
in the tables showing the proportions under the
normal curve, we find that the z-value needed to cut off 1% of the
distribution in one tail
is about 2i. So any difference of 2i SE-diff
or more
(in favor of the 'drug' mean) will be in that right-hand
tail. To reject the null hypothesis at the 1% level of significance

One- versus two-tailed tests
133
in this one-tailed test, we'll need a difiference of at least 2i SE-diff
- in favor of the drug.
So, although we might seem to have restricted our chances of
finding a significant difference by sticking our
necks
out and
predicting the direction of the difference, we have, in the process,
ensured that the difference we need to find
is smaller * (What
we've lost on the swings we've gained on the roundabouts!)
Does this seem to you like sharp practice or sleight of hand?
Many people have objected to the use of one-tailed tests, chiefly
on the grounds that the experimenter, who knows in which direc-
tion the difference should lie, will find
it easier to get a significant
difference and so
reject the
null
hypothesis. Hence there
is a
greater risk of Type
I error - claiming a difference as significant
when
it
is merely due to sampling variation. And, besides, since
such
experimenters
are
ignoring
the
possibility
that
the
dif-
ference may, against all expectations, lie in the opposite direction,
many important new phenomena may go unrecorded. Perhaps
the most
telling criticism of all
is
this:
*If you know so much
about the difference that you can even be confident about the
direction
in which
it will
lie, why do you need to test for signi-
ficance at all? A difference so predictable must be
significant.'
Some objectors also fear that the experimenter who fails to find
a significant difference using a two-tailed test may be tempted to
switch to a one-tailed test. For although a result of 'no significant
difference' might seem a worthwhile
scientific outcome
to an
experiment -
helping
close
off another
unpromising
line
of
inquiry - the fact
is that such experiments are far less likely to be
reported and,
if reported, far less likely to be published, than are
those in which a significant difference emerged. To some extent,
many researchers will feel that lack of significance denotes lack of
success.
However much people may criticize them,
it seems reasonably
certain that researchers will go on using one-tailed as well as two-
*By the way,
if we'd decided to do a one-tailed test of significance at the
5% level (rather than the
1 %), the tables would
tell us to look
for a
dif-
ference of li SE-difT or more - rather than 2 SE-diff or more which would
have been needed in a two-tailed test.

tailed
tests. If we are to be confident about his integrity, when
should a researcher state which test he
is using (and the level of
significance he proposes for rejecting the null hypothesis)?:
(a) before collecting his data? or
(b) after collecting his data? or
(c) at either of the above ?
4:
4:
4c
*
:|c
*
The researcher should say whether he
is using a one-tailed or
two-tailed test (and the level of significance at which he will reject
the null hypothesis) before collecting the data. (Bookmakers would
have little sympathy for someone who tried to place his bet only
once the race had been run!)
If, for example, the researcher used
a two-tailed
test to discover whether there was any reliable dif-
ference at
all, he should not switch to a one-tail comparison in
order to report a higher level of significance. What he should do,
in such circumstances,
is to collect more data with new samples,
and apply a one-tailed test to that.
Unfortunately,
it
is
not
always
possible
to
tell
whether a
researcher's alternative hypothesis was formulated prior to the
experiment, or was somehow tailored to fit the results themselves.
In
interpreting other people's reports we must be wary about
accepting their claims of 'significance' at face value. We should
consider first the background of the experiment (for example, the
results
of
similar
experiments
elsewhere, and
the
theoretical
reasonableness of the result). Then we can ask: does the proba-
bility of the recorded
diff"erence arising purely out of sampling
variation seem low enough to justify expecting it to occur reliably
in future comparisons?
So
let's find out how our examination candidates performed.
What was to be the null hypothesis in this experiment ?
4:
*
4e
The null hypothesis, you'll remember, was that the mean score of
the 'drug' students would not be significantly diff'erent from that
of the 'placebo' students. Our alternative hypothesis (formulated

One- versus two-tailed tests
135
in advance of comparing the results, you'll notice) was that the
*drug' mean would be higher.
The next step in significance testing is to specify the theoretical
distribution of differences between means we'd expect from a
population //the null hypothesis were really true. That is to say,
we'd expect a normal distribution with a mean of zero (no dif-
ference) and a standard deviation estimated by combining the
standard errors of the two means we'll get from our samples. (In
other words, the greater the dispersion in the samples, the greater
will
be
their
standard
deviations;
the
greater
their
standard
deviations, the greater will be our estimate of the standard errors
of their means; and the greater will be our estimate of the stand-
ard deviation, or standard error,
of differences
between means
from such samples.)
We now specify the level of significance at which we'll reject the
null
hypothesis. We decided, you remember, on a significance
level of 1%. This implies we want a difference between means (in
favor of the 'drug' mean)
so
large that the probability of
its
occurring by chance from the theoretical *no difference' popula-
tion mentioned above would be 1% or less. Thus we can indicate
a 'critical region' in the theoretical distribution, where the
alternative hypothesis will seem more acceptable to us than the
null hypothesis. In this case, the critical region will
fall in the tail
of the distribution where 'drug' means exceed 'placebo' means
by at least 2^ SE-diff.
273 SE-diff

136
Further matters of significance
Now we can look at the actual examination scores. We cal-
culate the means and standard deviations for the two samples of
students to be as follows:
mean
standard
score

*Drug' students
62.8

Â«
*
Â«
*
The difference in mean scores is 2.8 marks and
it does favour the
drug students. But
is
it a big enough difference to
fall
in what
we've decided should be the critical region? To answer this, we'll
need to know the standard error of the difference between the
means.
This
we'll
get
by combining
their
separate
standard
errors.
So,
the
standard
errors
of the two means
are
as
follows
(remember, there are 100 students in each sample):
SE-mean (drug)
= -y/l^ ^
^
^ ^^^^

SE-mean (placebo) = y'jQQ ^ Jq ^

(Just to remind you what SE-means are about, the above figures
imply that about 68% of any large group of similar students would
score between
62.8 Â±
1
marks
if given the
drug,
or
between
60 Â± 0.9 marks
if given the placebo.)
The standard error of the difference between the means
is a
combination of their separate standard errors:
SE-diff =
+ 0.92
= Vl + 0.81
=
â
1.3 marks

One- versus two-tailed tests
137
We can now indicate the theoretical distribution of differences
that would exist // the null hypothesis were true and both sample-
means came from the same population.
Since SE-diff =
1.3 marks, we can work out that 2 SE-diff = 2.6
marks,
3
SE-diff = 3.9
marks, and
so
on.
But
the
value of
SE-diff we are particularly interested in is 2} SE-diff, because this
is the value that cuts off the
critical
region. Our difference
in
means has to be larger than this
if it is to fall in that region and
thus be significant at the 1% level.
Well,
2i
SE-diff = 2.3 x
1.3 = 3
marks.
Is
the
difference
between
the mean
scores
of
'drug'
students
and
'placebo'
students (that is, 2.8 marks) significant at the 1% level?
4t
*
*
*
*
*
Since the difference between the mean scores of 'drug' students
and 'placebo' students is 2.8 marks, we have to conclude that
it is
not significant
at the 1%
level - not quite! (To get
in the 1%
critical region, we'd have needed a difference of at least 3 marks.)

138
Further matters of significance
This
difference
of
2.8 marks would,
of course,
have
been
significant
at the 5%
level. As you'll remember,
in a one-tailed
test, the 5% critical region would have included all diff"erences of
at least If SE-diff". Since, in this case,
1 J SE-diff = If x
1.3 = 2
marks, our diff'erence of 2.8 marks would have been well into the
5% critical region.
This
is just one of those cases where we might be tempted to
retreat
into meaningless verbal
labels - saying the diff'erence
is
not
* highly
significant' but
it
is
* significant'! Common
sense,
however, suggests that we look at the figures themselves before
making a decision. Admittedly the difference was not quite big
enough to have a less than 1% probability of occurring by chance.
So we can't be 99% certain that the two means come from dif-
ferent populations, and thus we can't reject the null hypothesis.
However, the difference did come very close to the critical region.
Suppose the same difference had been found between two much
larger samples - say of 150 students each. Would its significance
have been the same?
4c
4e
*
*
*
*
*
No,
if the same
diff'erence had been found
in a pair of much
larger samples,
its significance would have been
greater. With
samples of 150 students each (which would reduce the standard
error
to
about
1.1
marks),
the
diff'erence would
have
been
significant at the 1% level.
So, although there is insufficient evidence to be sure that *drug'
students can be relied on to do better than
* placebo' students, we
may take reassurance from the fact that the weight of the evi-
dence does nevertheless favor such a possibility.
Hence,
if the
drug was not too expensive to prepare, and appropriate exam-
ination candidates not too
difficult
to
get hold
of, we might,
after
all,
try the experiment again with larger samples. On the
other hand, we might well decide that, even if it turned out to be
real, a
diff'erence of just two or three marks wouldn't
be big
enough
to
justify further work. What we make of a difference
(given
its probability of having arisen by chance) must depend

z-tests and t-tests
139
not only on which side of the
* magic' 5% or 1%
it
lies, but on
many other, non-statistical factors also.
Z' tests and t-tests
By the way, the significance test we've spoken most of so far
is
sometimes called a z-test. This
is because we use the standard
deviation as a unit (z-unit)
for measuring the point where the
critical
region
begins
(e.g.
2 SD - 5%
or
1\ SD = 1%,
for
two-tailed tests) and relate
it to the proportions of the normal
curve.
However,
this
is
accurate
only
with
large
samples. When
samples
contain
less
than
30 members,
the sample
standard
deviation can no longer be relied on as an estimate of the standard
deviation
in
the population. (You'll remember, from page 92,
that the calculation of the standard error of the mean, on which
the whole structure depends, is based on such a reliance.) Indeed,
William Gossett, who published under the pen-name of ' Student
,'
noted that, in small samples, sample-SD w/2^/^/'-estimates popula-
tion-SD more than half the time.
Consequently, with samples of
less than
30, Student's
t-test
is used instead.
I won't trouble you with the details of this. But
you'll come across the term, so you'd better have a general idea.
In
fact, the
/-test uses the standard error of the differences be-
tween means (calculated exactly as in a z-test, but re-named the
'/-value').
But,
for the necessary proportions either
side of a
given value, we refer not to the normal distribution but to the
t-distribution
The /-distribution is similar to the normal distribution in being
symmetrical about a mean of zero, and
bell-shaped. But
it
is
flatter (more dispersed) and
its dispersion varies according to the
size of the sample. The diagram on the next page shows the
normal distribution and
the
/-distributions
for samples of 6
and of 20. As you can
see, the bigger the sample, the more
nearly does the /-distribution approach the normal
distribu-
tion.

Look at the area beyond 2 SE-diflf in the graph above. Compare
the proportion of the differences (the area under the curves) in
each of the three distributions. Clearly, the proportion of extreme
differences between two samples
is assumed to get greater and
greater as the sample size gets smaller. That
is, small samples are
more likely to give significant-looking results.
So, to establish significance at a given level (e.g. the 5% level),
the
/-test
for
small samples must demand what
kind
of
dif-
ference: (a) a smaller difference or (b) a larger difference?
The smaller the samples, the larger the difference demanded by
the /-test; otherwise, since big differences occur more frequently
as samples get smaller, the probability of getting a significant
result would increase as the sample size decreases.
With the
/-test, then, a big difference
is needed to establish
significance if the samples are small. As the sample size increases,
smaller and smaller differences become significant. For instance,
to be significant at the 5% level, the difference between samples of
4 would need to exceed 3.2 x SE-diff. But with samples of 12, a
difference of 2.2 x SE-diff would
be
significant
at
this
level.
Then, with samples of around
100,

Comparing several means

reach 2 x SE-diff. With such
large samples, the /-distribution
becomes identical with the normal distribution.
Comparing several means
The z-test (or /-test)
is used when we wish to check whether two
samples are likely to have come from the same or from different
populations. But very often we are interested
in the differences
between three or more samples. For instance, though we com-
pared the mean scores of
* drug' students and 'placebo' students,
perhaps we should have compared their mean scores with that of
a
third sample group - a random sample from among those
examination candidates who were given neither drug nor placebo.
(After all, the 'placebo' students may have performed better than
untreated students simply because they thought they had been
given the drug.) Similarly, we may wish to know whether there are
any significant differences in learning ability between four breeds
of mice
.
.
. five different methods of teaching quadratic equations
... six different conditions for the germination of seeds
.
.
. and
so on.
At
first
sight, you may not be aware that there's a problem
here. Why not simply compare each
possible pair of samples,
using a z-test or /-test ? Thus, for example, the drug sample could
be compared with the placebo sample and with the no-treatment
sample, and
the placebo sample could
be compared with
the
no-treatment sample: three significance tests in
all. Similarly,
if
we
were
looking
for
significant
differences
between
samples
A,
B, C and D, we could compare them
like this: A-B; A-C;
A-D; B-C; B-D; C-D;
six
tests
in
all.
Unfortunately,
as we
increase the number of samples to be compared, the number of
inter-sample comparisons increases at a much faster rate. Thus,
six samples would involve 15
tests, eight would involve 28, ten
would involve 45, and so on.
Now the sheer
labor
of doing
all
these
tests
is one
disin-
centive. How frustrating to do, say, 45 inter-sample comparisons
before discovenng
that
there
is no
significant
difference any-

142
Further matters of significance
where among them -
especially
since
there
is one
test
that
enables you to check first whether there
is such a difference at all
before you start trying to track
it down.
But there
is an even more important reason for doing one test
rather than
several. Remember
that,
if we
are
looking
for a
diff'erence that
is significant at, say, the 5% level, we risk that in
the long run we'd be mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis five
times
in a hundred. That
is to say, because of chance variations
in
samples, one out of every twenty comparisons
is
likely
to
reach the 5% level of significance by chance alone.
So, as we increase the number of z-tests (or r-tests) we do on a
body of data, how does
it
aff"ect our chances of making a false
claim ?

The greater the number of separate tests we make, the greater is
the
likelihood
that
we'll
claim some
differences
as
real when
actually they are due to chance.
All right, so multiple tests can't be justified. Another solution
that might occur to you
is to take the pair of samples with the
biggest
difference
in means, and apply the significance
test to
them. (And
perhaps,
if that
difference proves
significant, you
next take the pair with the second biggest difference, and keep on
until you reach a difference that
is no longer significant.) How-
ever, to do this would be to load the odds unfairly in favor
of
finding a significant difference. Can you see why?
4e

:ie
He
*
Well, the significance test applies only to the difference between
pairs of samples chosen randomly from the population. Clearly,
if we choose a pair of samples because they are very different, then
we are not choosing at random.
After all,
it should be apparent that the chance that the biggest

Comparing several means
143
of several
differences
will
turn
out
to be
significant
is much
greater than that of a single difference whose size you don't yet
know. (Similarly,
if you predict merely that the winner of the
next Olympics pole-vault
will break the world record, you are
on to a safer bet than
if you have to forecast the name of the
record-breaker.) The
problem
resembles
that
with
one-tailed
versus two-tailed
tests. You would be justified
in
testing
indi-
vidual differences only
if you'd predicted the ones
likely to be
significant in advance.
Fortunately, there is a single test whereby several samples can
be compared at once.
It
is called the f-test - after the British
statistician,
R.
A.
Fisher, who
developed
the
process
called
ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, on which
it rcsts. Analysis of variance
could be applied to comparing two groups.
In such a case, the
F-test would give the same result as a z-test or f-test.
It
is more
commonly used, however, when three or more samples are to be
compared.
It answers the question: 'Are there one or more signi-
ficant differences anywhere among these samples?' If the answer
is No, there will be no point
in examining the data any further.
The computations involved in analysis of variance can be quite
complex.
Nevertheless, since
it
is such an important technique,
I really must
try
to convey some idea of
its underlying prin-
ciples.
The basic situation
in which we use the technique
is this: we
have a number of observed values, divided among three or more
groups. What we want to know
is whether these observed values
might all belong to the same population, regardless of group, or
whether the observations
in at
least one of the groups seem to
come from a different population. And the way we'll get at an
answer
is by comparing the variability of values within groups
with the variability of values between groups.
I'd better just mention, in this connection, that the F-test makes
a similar assumption to the /-test (or z-test) which is: the samples
are all supposed to have similar dispersions.

in which the
dispersion
is approximately
the same
in
all samples.
But
not
to situation
(ii), in which one of the samples
is quite different in
dispersion.
Now let's illustrate analysis of variance with an example - an
extreme one to make the point. We have given a
test to three
groups of students. But first, we gave our memory-drug to one
group (A), a placebo to a second group (B), and did nothing at all
to a
third group
(C). Their
test-results (out of 30) show the
following (somewhat striking!) pattern:
Group B
Group C

Compare the variability of scores within groups with that between
groups. Would you, or would you not, feel that one or more of
these groups was significantly different from the others ?
Students'

nn *****

Comparing several means
145
The variability of scores within groups
is small.
It happens to
be the same in each case, with scores differing by no more
than four points either way from the group-means of 25,
15
and
5.
(In
fact,
the
standard
deviation
of
each
group
is
3.16*, suggesting a similar standard deviation in the popula-
tion from which they came.)
But
clearly
the
scores
differ
much more from group to group than they do within groups.
There
is no overlap between the groups. Group A scores are
all in the twenties. Group B
in tens, and Group C
in
units.
(In fact, the standard deviation (standard error) of the three
sample means (25, 15 and 5)
is lO.t)
If these means were all
to come from
the same
population
of
sample-means,
this
standard
error
suggests
that
the population would need
to
have a standard deviation of about 22 - far bigger than the
population-SD suggested by the variability within the groups.
So we can
feel pretty sure that
all three groups are
signifi-
cantly different from one another - they come from different
populations. We'd expect similar group differences in similar
circumstances. We
can
predict
that,
on
average,
students
given the memory-drug will do better than students given
a
placebo, and both
will do better than students who are
left
alone.
So the analysis of variance depends on comparing the varia-
bility
of
values
within
groups
with
the
variability
between
groups. We ought to be asking whether the random variability
between individuals seen in the samples was sufficient to account
for the variability between samples. In a case like that above, we
wouldn't need to apply analysis of variance, because the answer
leaps out at us. Let's look
briefly at another example,
still very
simple, but less blatant, and follow through the logic of analysis
of variance.
With samples as small as this, to divide the sum of the squared deviations
from the mean by the number m the sample
(in
this case
5) would be to
ttÂ«i/er-estimate the population-SD.
It
is customary
to divide by one
less
than the number
in the sample, so
I have divided by 4.
t Again,
I have divided the sum of the squared deviations from the overall
mean by one less than
in the sample of three means,
i.e. 2.

Students'
scores
It
is not so easy here to compare variability within and between
the groups. We cannot
tell, just at a glance, how different the
groups are from one another.
If you examine the scores closely,
however, you should be able to see which group has the largest
mean and which the smallest. Which
is which ?
The three means are: A-28; B-26; C-23.
Are these means
sufficiently different (taking account of the
variability in
all the data) to suggest that they come from more
than one population? Analysis of variance will
tell
us.
We'll begin with the null hypothesis that all three samples are
from the same population. The alternative hypothesis
is that they
are not all from the same population. That
is,
it could be that one
of the samples comes from a population whose mean
is different
from that of the population the other two samples come from. Or
it could be that
all three samples come from populations with
different means.
Anyway, with the data we have available, we can make two
different estimates of variability
in the common population we
are assuming under the null hypothesis. According to how closely
these two estimates agree, we accept or reject the null hypothesis.
For computational reasons, which
I won't bother you with, this
variability
is expressed not by a standard deviation but by the
square of the standard deviation. This, you may remember (from
page 54)
is called the variance. So V = SD^.
We get our first estimate of the variability in the population by
pooling the variability from within the three samples. Calculations

Comparing several means
147
would show
that
the average variance within
the samples
is
4.17.
Our second estimate of the variability in the population comes
from the three sample-means. The variance among them
is only
6.33; but, if they are all supposed to have come from one popula-
tion,
its variance would have to be much larger. In fact, using the
relationship between SE-mean (which we can calculate directly
from the sample-means), sample-SD, and sample-size - which we
last
looked
at on page 92 -
the population
variance can
be
estimated as 31.65.
So we have two estimates of variance in the common popula-
tion we assumed under the
null
hypothesis. To assess the null
hypothesis, we'll need to compare the two estimates.
Which of the two estimates of variance would you expect to be
larger
if we are to
reject
the
null
hypothesis (and say that the
samples come from more than one population)? Would
it be (a)
the within-groups estimate? or(b) the between-groups estimate?
;|c
4^
*
*
*
*
9|c
If the null hypothesis
is
false (and there
is a real difference in
population-means) we can expect the between-groups estimate of
variance (b) to be larger than the within-groups estimate. That
is,
it will be suggesting a variability greater than the mere sampling
variation suggested by the within-groups variance.
In
this
case,
the
between-groups
estimate
of
population
variance (31.65) is clearly much larger than the within-groups one
(4.17).
But,
is
it
large enough
for us to be confident
that
it
is
attributable not simply to random, sampling variation but also to
the fact that at least one of the samples contains values that are,
on
the whole,
significantly greater or smaller than one of the
other samples?
(In
short, we're asking whether the difference
between these samples
is a reliable one that we could expect to
see repeated in similar tests.)
Next, we compare the two estimates by calculating the ratio
between them - dividing
the between-groups estimate by
the
within-groups estimate - and
observing whether
it
is
greater
than 1. We then check this variance-ratio (or f-r atio) against the

148
Further matters of significance
F-DiSTRiBUTiON. This
is a 'family' of curves,
like the ^distri-
butions, whose shape differs according to the samples. The F-
curves,
however,
differ
not
only according
to
the
size of the
samples
but
also
according
to how many samples
are
being
compared. In general, the smaller the samples (and/or the fewer
of them),
the
bigger must
the
F-ratio
be m
order
to
attain
significance.
Of course, there are tables
of the F-distribution,
giving the
critical ratios for all sample-sizes and numbers of samples.
If we
looked
in these tables, we'd see that, with three samples of five
students, we'd need an F-ratio of at
least 3.89
in order to reach
significance at the 5%
level, and an F-ratio of at
least 6.93
to
reach the 1% level of significance.
Our two estimates of population variance give an F-ratio of
31.65 ^
4.17
'"^^
which clearly exceeds 6.93 and indicates that the two estimates
are significantly different at the 1%
level. How can we interpret
this difference:
(a)
all three samples are from the same population? or
(b) the samples are not all from the same population? or
(c) the three samples are all from different populations?
:|e

He
It
is not possible to say whether the sample-means are all signi-
ficantly different or whether two of them are the same. All we
can
be sure of
is
(b),
the samples are not
all from
the same
population. Thus we reject the null hypothesis.
So, as we've seen
in the above example, analysis of variance
is a technique used to analyse the overall variance
in a set
of
samples. The
variance
is
divided
into two components:
the
within-samples variance and the between-samples variance. If the

Comparing several means
149
between-samples estimate of variance
is much bigger than that
from
within
samples,
we
conclude
that
ordinary
sampling
variation is not enough to account for the difference in means. At
least one of the samples comes from a population with a different
mean.
The analysis of variance can be applied to much more complex
comparisons than the example given above. That was a one-
way ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. But wc could have two-way,
three-way, four-way, etc., analysis of variance. As an example of a
TWO-w^AY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, wc might re-run our test
(but with a larger sample), noting the scores not only according
to whether students were given the drug, the placebo, or nothing,
but also according to whether they were, say, male or female.
This would
give us six groups of students. Each group might
have a
different mean
score on
the
test, something
like
this
perhaps:
Drug
Placebo
Nothing
Male
25
26
22
Female
28
22
25
Looking at the variability of the scores within the groups as well
as between them, we could
then ask whether
the means
are
significantly
different
for men and women
as well
as whether
they are significantly different for the three conditions originally
compared. We might also have classified our test students as, say,
introvert or extrovert, and thus done a three-way
analysis of
variance. (We'd then have needed
3 x 2 x 2 = 12 groups
to
ensure we had reasonably large samples.
It should be clear that
we have to be very careful about how we design our experiment
if there
is any
intention of using analysis of variance on
the
resulting data.)
Finally, on analysis of variance, we might notice that once we
get on to two-way, three-way, etc., we can look for interaction
EFFECTS between conditions. For instance,
in the table above

150
Further matters of significance
we see that how students do on the test depends not only on how
they are treated beforehand, but also on which sex they are. If
we brought in the personality dimension, we might discover that,
say,
introvert males responded to the memory-drug more
like
extrovert
females
than
like
extrovert
males,
and
so
on. By
analysing
the
overall
variance of the students'
scores
into
its
separate components, we could
test any such hypotheses
that
seemed worth following up.
Comparing proportions
To end this chapter,
I must just mention a very important kind
of
significance
test
that
is
used when our
investigation
con-
cerns category-variables rather than quantity-variables (that
is,
when we are concerned not with a measurement
of quantity
for each member of the sample but with counting how many
members
fall
into each of a number of descriptive categories).
This
is one
of
the
'non-parametric'
tests
1 mentioned
back
on page 125.
The simplest comparisons would concern characteristics with
just two categories:
e.g. male/female; yes/no;
pass/fail;
plain/
fancy, and so on. For instance, one characteristic might concern
the sex of applicants to college, and the second might concern
whether
or
not
they
have had
previous
work-experience
(as
defined in a questionnaire). We might then test whether there is a
significant
diff"erence
between
the
proportions
of males and
females who have had prior work-experience.
In fact we could
test the significance of such a difference by
using a statistic mentioned on page 99:
the standard error of
a proportion. There
is a test for the significance of a difference
between two proportions
that
closely
follows
the method we
discussed for testing the difference between two means. However,
I want to introduce here an alternative method, which can be used
with attributes that have more than two categories.
It
is, in fact,
one of the most widely used tests in social statistics. It is called the
test. (That, by the way,
is not a large X but the Greek letter.

Comparing proportions
151
chi, pronounced 'Kye' as in
'sky'.)
You'll see
it written
also
as the CHI-SQUARE TEST.
How would we use this test to compare the work-experience of
male and female applicants? Consider the data we obtain from
a random sample of applicants, 100 of each sex:
Obtained frequencies
Work Experience
yes
no
total
Sex of
male
70
30
100
Applicant
female
50
50

200
Can you see any signs of a correspondence between an appli-
cant's sex and
whether
or
not
he/she
has
had
prior work-
experience ?
The table does seem to show a correspondence. 70% of the men
have had work-experience compared with 50% of the women.
However, what we have to decide
is whether this represents a
real, reliable difference between the proportions in the popula-
tions of male and female applicants. How far can we be sure
that
it's not
just a chance, sampling variation
that
could
be
wiped out, or even reversed,
if we took another sample of 200
applicants?
We'll
start,
as always, by
stating our
null hypothesis: men
and women
applicants
are
equally
likely
to
have had work-
experience. On the basis of this
null
hypothesis we draw up a
table of EXPECTED FREQUENCIES. That
is,
if men and women
are really equally likely to have work-experience, how many of
the 200 students would we expect to
fall
into each of the four
cells of the middle table? (If we are to assert that there is a real
difference between men and women on
this attribute, then we
must demonstrate that the gap between the expected frequencies

152
Further matters of significance
and those we actually obtained is just too big to have arisen out of
sampling variation alone.)
So what are the expected frequencies? How would the 200
students be expected to parcel themselves out if there really were
no sex differences? Surely, we would expect to see the percentage
of experienced men
equal
to
the
percentage
of experienced
women. And
both should
be equal
to
the
percentage of ex-
perienced applicants in the sample as a whole,
i.e. 60%.

We saw from our sample that 60% of applicants overall (1 20 out of
200) had work-experience. So how would you
fill
in the four
middle cells of the table to show what we'd expect, //this propor-
tion were true also for the men and women separately?

Now we'll put our expected (E) and obtained (O) frequencies
together and see how much they differ. The bigger the difference,
the less likely
it is to have arisen within a single population.

As you can check, the difference between the obtained and the
expected frequency in each cell is + 10 or â 10. Is this big enough
to be significant? The way we decide
is by calculating the chi-
square
statistic. The size of
depends on the sizes of the dif-
ferences and
(loosely speaking) on how many
differences
are
involved.
For the data above,
turns out to be equal
to 8.33.
If the
differences between observed and expected frequencies had been
greater, then chi-square's value would have been more than 8.33.
(Similarly
if there had been more categories involved.) On the
other hand, smaller differences would have made
smaller than
8.33 But, again,
is 8.33 big enough to be statistically significant?
You won't be surprised, by this time, to hear that we'd look
for the answer in a table
showing the distribution of chi-square.
The chi-square distribution, like that of / and of F,
is a family of
curves;
their shapes vary
(loosely speaking) according
to
the
number of differences involved. When we look at the table for
distribution of chi-square involving four differences, we find that a
of 3.84
is exceeded
in only 5% of occasions,
and
a x^
of
6.33 in only 1%.
So,
is the x^ we have found - 8.33 - significant? And,
if so, at
what
level? And what does
this
result
tell
us about the
likely
work-experience of men and women applicants generally?
Â«
*
*
4c
*
Â«
Â«
The value of chi-square we obtained, 8.33, clearly exceeds not
only 3.84 but also 6.63. We can say, therefore, that
it is certainly

154
Further matters of significance
significant at the 1% level. A value this big should occur less than
once in a hundred samples
if there really were no difference
in
work-experience between men and women applicants. So we are
prepared
to
reject
the
null
hypothesis and
assert
(with 99%
confidence!) that the difference
is real - we can rely on
its ap-
pearing again in similar samples.
Enough of significance testing. You will no doubt have found
the
last two chapters quite tough going. The
next, and
final,
chapter should seem considerably easier. In our final chapter we'll
look
at
the
important
statistical
concepts of correlation and
regression. But youMl find
this
gives
us an
opportunity to re-
view many of the ideas we've touched on earlier.

8. Analysing relationships
In previous chapters we have considered how to describe samples
in terms of some category- or quantity-variable. We have also
considered how to generalize (with proper caution) from a sample
to a population. Furthermore, we have compared samples with a
view to inferring a difference between populations. In particular,
we have seen how to show whether two or more samples that are
different
in one variable are also significantly different
in some
other variable. For instance, we know how chi-square is used -
as we did to establish whether students who have prior work-
experience are more likely to pass the first year of the course than
students who have none. And we understand the use of a /-test
(or a z-test) - for example to establish whether the students whose
travelling-time to college
is above average have a significantly
higher absentee-rate than students whose travelling time
is less
than average.
However, such comparisons merely
establish a connection.
They tell us something about students in general, but they do not
allow us to make very precise predictions about individuals. This
is because so much information has been
lost by reducing the
data to dichotomies (above/below average;
pass/fail,
etc.), and
by representing a spread of values by one
* typical* value, the
mean. In fact, most of the procedures we've discussed so far are
appropriate
chiefly
to
exploratory
research:
identifying
con-
nected variables.
But we often want to go beyond this. We want to establish the
nature of the relationship between two or more variables. For
some reason or other, we may also want
to predict,
say, the
following: given that a certain student has so many months of
work-experience, what percentage is she likely to get in her first-
year exam?
Alternatively,
given
that another student
lives so
many minutes away from the college, how often is he likely to be
155

156
Analysing relationships
late during the term? Or, again, given that a student has such-
and-such a pulse-rate, what
is his blood-pressure
likely to be?
And, in all such situations, the accuracy of our predictions would
depend on the strength of the relationship.
This takes us into the study of correlation and regres-
sion.
Correlation
concerns
the
strength
of
the
relationship
between the values of two variables. Regression analysis deter-
mines the nature of that
relationship and enables us to make
predictions from
it.
Paired values
In studying correlation, weMl be looking at samples where each
member has provided us with a value on two (or more) different
variables. For
instance, we might
test the
intelligence and the
manual
dexterity of thirty students and so
get
thirty
pairs of
values. We might compare crime-rate and unemployment-rate
for each of the country's twenty largest cities. We might compare
the distance and the brightness of a hundred stars. In each case,
we can look to see how far large values on one variable are as-
sociated with large values on the other, or whether large values
on one are linked with small values on the other.
So, from each member of the sample, we get two different
measurements. Taking a very clear-cut example to
start
with,
suppose our sample consists of a number of circles of differing
radii. For each circle we know the radius and the circumference.
Here are the figures:
Circle

How would you
describe
the
relationship between
these two
variables - what happens to the values of one variable as those of
the other increase or decrease ?
9|e

Clearly, the circumference increases
in length when the radius
increases. Big values on one variable are associated with
big

Paired values
157
values on the other, and small with small. Variables that vary
together are said to be correlated - related one to the other.
We can illustrate the exactness of this particular relationship by
plotting the values on a new kind of dot-diagram. Each dot on
the diagram below represents a sample member, for which we
have two measurements.

Radius (cm)
(You can,
if you
like, see this as a combination of two dot-
diagrams of the type
I used in Chapter 3 to describe distributions.
To show you what
I mean, I've
* dotted' the distritiution of radius
sizes along the horizontal
axis, and
that of the circumference
up the vertical
axis. Then
I've pulled
these up and across,
re-
spectively, to form the common distribution of paired values.)
Once we are satisfied that some relationship does exist, we can
establish
the
precise nature of that
relationship and
use
it
to
predict
values of one
variable
that would correspond
to any
given values of the other. In the case of our circles, we know that
radius and circumference are related by a formula (C = Inv =
2 X 3.142 X
r). So we can
* predict' exactly the circumference
of any circle, given
its radius, e.g. a circle of 20 cm radius will be
2 X 3.142 X 20 = 125.68 cm
in circumference.
The exactness of the relationship can be seen
in the diagram
above. The plotted points
lie along an imaginary straight line. If
we were actually to draw a line through them, we could use it for
making exact predictions without even using the formula.
Most correlations are not so clear cut, however; hence our

158
Analysing relationships
predictions can be nothing like so accurate. Suppose we take a
sample of ten students (A-J) and compare their marks on two
different tests, one theoretical, one practical:

What relationship can you see among these pairs of scores? Are
high theory marks associated with high or low practical marks?
Always, or just usually?
With a few exceptions,
students with high theory scores also
did well on the practical. However,
it was not too easy to see this
pattern in the raw data. Let's try to bring out the relationship with

This diagram shows quite clearly that there
is a relationship
between how students score on the two
tests. Higher practical
scores tend to go with higher theory scores, and lower with lower.
But there are exceptions. The relationship (the correlation)
is
much less strong than that between the radius and circumference
of circles.
Because the correlation is weaker, the dots do not lie along a
straight line. Admittedly, as I've done in the diagram above, we
can
* imagine' a straight line running through (among) the dots -
from bottom-left to top-right. But the dots would be scattered
away from any such line, with some on either side of it.
In fact,
it is usual for this to happen in a dot-diagram illustrat-
ing a correlation. The dots are usually scattered on either side of

an imaginary straight line. Hence, such a dot-diagram is called a
SCATTER DIAGRAM.
Three kinds of correlation
The scatter diagram of scores above shows an example of what
is
called
positive correlation.
There,
changes
in
one
variable are accompanied by changes in the other variable and in
the some direction; that
is, larger values on one variable tend to
go with larger values on the other.
But
in many, equally strong relationships, the two variables
change in opposite directions. Larger values on one will tend to
go with smaller values on the other. This
is called negative
correlation. There might
well, for example, be a negative
correlation between age and running speed within a group of
college lecturers,
i.e. the older, the slower; and the younger, the
faster.
If there were no clear tendency for the values on one variable
to move in a particular direction (up or down) with changes in
the other variable, we might say we had something approaching a
zero correlation.
(I say
* approaching' because
it
is very
difficult to find two variables with absolutely no relationship at
all.) The relationship between age and weight of adult students
might well approach zero correlation.
Here are three scatter diagrams. They illustrate the three kinds
of correlations mentioned above. Which is which?

The correlations
illustrated
in
the
scatter diagrams above are
negative (A), approximately zero (B), and positive (C).
Now
let
us determine
the correlation
between each of the
following pairs of variables. Mark each
pair to show whether
you'd expect each correlation to be positive (+), negative (â ), or
towards zero (0).
(i) Rainfall and attendance at football games.
(ii) The age of a car and
its value.
(iii) Length of education and annual earnings.
(iv) Sales of television sets and cinema attendances over a period
of time.
(v) Ability to see in the dark and quantity of carrots eaten.
(vi) Level of unemployment and installment plan sales over
a period of time.
(vii) Miles driven and amount of fuel consumed.
(viii) Amount of smoking and incidence of lung cancer.
(ix) The scores obtained on each of two dice thrown together.

I would expect the following correlations:

The strength of a correlation
As
I have
already mentioned,
correlations vary
not
only
in
direction (+ or â ) but also
in strength. We saw the strongest
possible relationship - a perfect relationship - between the radius
and the circumference of circles. Here the plotted points on the
'scatter' diagram lay on a straight line.
Similarly, of course, we could have a perfect negative relation-
ship:
say, between the
size of a
withdrawal you make from
your bank account and the amount that would be
left to your
credit. There, too, the dots on the 'scatter' diagram would
lie
along a straight line.

162
Analysing relationships
However, perfect correlation
is unlikely to occur in statistical
inquiries (though
it
is common enough
in
mathematics and
scientific theory). Usually we have to deal with weaker relation-
ships - where the plotted points on a dot-diagram are scattered
away from a
straight
line. That
is to
say,
the values on one
variable keep roughly in step (positively or negatively) with those
on the other - but not exactly in step. In general, then, the closer
the plotted points lie to a straight line, the stronger the relation-
ship - the higher the degree of correlation. (And the higher the
degree of correlation, the more confidently we can predict values
of one variable, given values of the other.)
Which of the three scatter diagrams below would seem to show
the highest degree of correlation?

The highest degree of correlation is shown in B, where the plotted
points
lie closest
to a straight
line.
In A, the points are more
scattered. In C, the points are so scattered that we can't see any
sign of a straight
line, indicating about zero correlation.
So the amount of scatter in a scatter diagram gives us a rough
measure of the strength of a correlation. But for serious statistical
work something more precise
is required. We need a numerical
measure - a number, or index, or coefficient that
will be at a
maximum when the correlation
is strong and reduce to a mini-
mum as the correlation weakens. Such an index exists and
is
called the correlation coefficient. It is usually represented
by the letter r.
Like an average or a measure of dispersion, the correlation
coeflficient is a statistic. It helps describe a sample - in this case a

sample of paired values from two different variables. The cor-
relation coefficient measures the closeness with which the pairs of
values fit a straight line.
In
fact,
there are several
different
kinds of correlation
co-
efficient (as there are, you'll remember, different kinds of averages
and measures of dispersion). The one most commonly used
is
called (because of its mathematical origins, which we won't delve
into)
the product-moment correlation coefficient.
The appropriate formula takes into account the amount by which
each value
differs from
the mean of
its own
distribution, the
standard deviation of the two distributions, and the number of
pairs of values.
There
is
also
a
non-parametric formula which
produces a
RANK CORRELATION COEFFICIENT.
It
Can
be
used when
measured values do not exist (or are unreliable), especially when
sample-members
have
been
merely
ranked
in order on two
category-variables. The closer the relationship between rankings,
the bigger will be the correlation coefficient.
Both formulae are so arranged that the correlation coefficient
(/â¢) cannot
lie outside the range between + 1 and â 1
. Those two
values of r represent,
respectively,
perfect
positive and
perfect
negative correlation. When r = 0, there
is no correlation at
all.
The closer the correlation coefficient gets to + 1 or â 1
, the stronger
the correlation; the closer it gets to 0, the weaker
it is:

Analysing relationships
Thus
r = +0.73 would
indicate a
stronger relationship than
r = +0.45; and
r = â0.84 would be stronger than
either of
them. The coefficients for the three correlations shown
in the
scatter diagrams on page 160 are, in (A) r = â 0.67; in (B) r =
approx. 0; and in (C) r = +0.95
Look at the three scatter diagrams opposite. The sizes of the
coefficients
for these correlations are 0.98, 0.58 and 0.47. But
what
sign
( + or â )
goes
with
each
coefficient,
and
which
coefficient do you think belongs to each diagram ?
The correlation coefficients for the relationships shown opposite
are: in (A) r = -0.58; in (B) r = +0.47; and in (C) r = -0.98.
It may have taken you a while to decide which of (A) or (B) was
the more scattered. In fact,
it
is one of the limitations of scatter
diagrams that with correlations of less than about r = 0.5,
it's
quite difficult to judge the difference in scatter.
The significance of a correlation coefficient
So the correlation coefficient describes the strength and direction
of the relationship between
pairs of values from two different
variables. But, of course,
it
is based upon a sample. For example,
we may find a correlation of r = +0.80 between
lateness and
travelling-time to college among a sample of 49 students. By now,
you'll be sophisticated enough in the ways of statistics to realize
immediately that
if we took another sample of 49 we'd be most
unlikely
to
get a correlation
coefficient of exactly
+0.80. We
might easily get +0.75 or +0.89, for instance - simply as a result
of sampling variation.
So we cannot jump from description to inference and say that,
in the population as a whole, r = +0.80 also. How far we can
trust a sample-r as an estimate of population-r will depend on two
factors. The first
is the size of the coefficient. The bigger
it
is, the
less likely
it
is to have arisen by chance. We'd be unlikely to find
r = â0.95,
for
instance,
unless
the two
variables
really
are

negatively
related (though
not
necessarily so
strongly).
If, on
the
other
hand, we found
r = +0.10,
say, we'd
not
be too
surprised
to
get
r = 0 or even
(reversing the direction of the
relationship) r = â0.10 on another sample.
So the size of the coefficient
is one of the two factors on which
its reliability depends. Can you imagine what the other will be?
4c
)(e
4:
*
*
*
The other factor is the size of the sample. The more pairs of values
we have
in the sample, the more
likely we are to see a similar
correlation coefficient in other samples (and in the population as a
whole).
We can
use
these two
factors
to
calculate
the standard
ERROR OF THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT. (In this CaSC, the
standard error represents the standard deviation of a hypothetical
distribution of correlation coefficients among samples of a given
size drawn from
the same population.) We can estimate
it by
squaring the correlation coefficient, subtracting
it from one, and
then dividing
it by the square root of the number of pairs in the
sample.
So, the standard error of the correlation coefficient of +0.80
which came from a sample of 49 pairs
is:
SE. = L:^W =
^ -0-64 ^ 036 ^
V49
7
7
As you can
see,
the bigger the correlation coefficient^ the larger
would be the number subtracted from
1, and the smaller the
number into which the square root of the sample size is divided;
and so the smaller the size of the standard error. Similarly, the
larger the sample, the larger the square root we divide by, and
hence the smaller the standard error.
What does this mean?
It means that
if we continued to draw
samples of 49 from the same population to study the relationship
between lateness and travelling-time, we could expect to find that
about 68% of them had correlation
coefficients
in
the range
r Â±
1 SEr, (i.e. +0.80 Â± 0.05); the value of r would
lie between
+0.75 and
+0.85. Furthermore, about 95% of all coefficients

The significance of a correlation coefficient
167
would lie between rÂ±2 SEr, (i.e. +0.80 Â± 0.10). And about 99%
would lie within 2i SEr either side of +0.80, (i.e. +0.80 Â± 0.1 25).
These latter two ranges are the 95% and 99% confidence intervals
for the correlation coefficient we found. To sum up, we can be:

+0.75 and +0.85

If we wanted to be practically certain (99.7%) of including the
true correlation coefficient of the population, we would say
it
lies in the range of r = +0.80 Â± (how manyl) SEr.
4(
*
*
The true correlation coefficient of the population (like the true
mean of a population)
is 99.7% certain to
lie within 3 standard
errors
of the sample
statistic;
in
this
case,
within
the range
+0.80 Â±
3(0.05). So
the
true
correlation
coefficient
for
the
population from which our sample-r of +0.80
is drawn
is most
unlikely to be smaller than +0.65 or larger than +0.95.
With a correlation coefficient as large as +0.80 and from a
sample of 49 pairs, we need have little doubt that the relationship
is genuine.
It could scarcely have arisen by chance from a popu-
lation with a true r of 0 (or thereabouts). If our sample-r had been
small, however, we could not have been so certain. Suppose, for
instance, that we'd found r = +0.10 in this sample. This would
have given a standard error of
V49
7

Clearly,
this sample
correlation
coefficient
could
easily have
arisen in a population with r = 0. The standard error is actually
larger than the coefficient. Even the range of r Â±
1 SEr, giving
possible values of r between â0.03 and +0.23 (taking in 68% of
all correlation coefficients from such samples), would be sufficient
to reverse the relationship, by including negative correlations as
well
as
positive ones! We could have no
faith here that we'd
found a reliable relationship. Though
it clearly does exist in the
sample,
it perhaps does not in the population.

168
Analysing relationships
If we want to state the certainty with which we claim to have
found a real relationship, we can apply a significance test. (There
is, in fact, a /-test in which a /-value is calculated from the size of
the coefficient and the size of the sample, and then assessed by
reference to the /-distribution mentioned in the previous chapter.)
What do you think the null hypothesis would be in testing the
significance of a correlation ?
The null hypothesis
is that there
is no relationship in the popu-
lation; thus we assume that population-r =
0.
If the population-r were really 0,
it would be normally distri-
buted with a standard error of
1 - (0)2
1
Vsample-size
Vsample-size
So, in about 95% of samples from such a population, sample-r
would be within 2 standard errors of 0; and
in about 99%
it
would be within 2^ standard errors. Hence, as a rough-and-ready
test (slightly more inclined to Type
II errors than the /-test), we
can say that a sample correlation coefficient
is significant

at the 5% level if its size (+ or â ) exceeds 2 x-7=L=

and
at the 1%

if its size (+ or â) exceeds 2^ xVsample-size
Thus, in a sample of 49 pairs of values, to be significant at the
5% level, the coefficient would have to be greater than

probability was clearly far less than one in a hundred that such a
large
coefficient would have
arisen from a population where
really r = 0.) Equally obviously, the coefficient of 0.10 would not
have been significant at either level.
Suppose you calculated the height/weight correlation in a sample

need to convince you that the relationship was significant at the

The coefficient would be significant if it was greater than

Interpreting a correlation coefficient
As we've seen before, a statistic can be
* significant ' without, in the
everyday sense, being either strong or important. This is equally
true of the correlation coefficient. Quite a small value of r can be
significant
if
it
has come from
a
large enough
sample. For
example, in a sample of 1,000, a correlation of Â± 0.08 would be
significant at the 1% level. This leads many people to ask what
counts as a weak correlation or a strong one - or even to ask when
a correlation can be considered
* satisfactory
.
If you remember our discussion on the usefulness of attaching
verbal labels to levels of significance, you won't expect me to be
very sympathetic to verbal descriptions of correlations. However,
you'll find other writers using them - though not necessarily in
the same way as one another. But, just as a guide, here is the kind
of label they might attach to particular ranges of the correlation
coefficient (whether positive or negative, of course):

170
Analysing relationships
0.0 to 0.2
very weak, negligible
0.2 to 0.4
weak, low
0.4 to 0.7
moderate
0.7 to 0.9
strong, high, marked
0.9 to 1.0
very strong, very high
What about the other question, as to what counts as a 'satis-
factory' level of correlation? This
is as daft as asking what
is a
satisfactory
height.
It
all
depends on
the
context. A
height
satisfactory
for an
aspiring jockey or female
ballet dancer
might not be satisfactory for an aspiring policeman or tennis
champion. Similarly,
in some circumstances a small correla-
tion may be highly satisfactory, whereas in others a high one
may
not
be
high
enough.
But
perhaps
in
the
majority
of
cases, the question of 'satisfactoriness' is totally irrelevant.
Consider these cases:
(i) A sociologist establishes a correlation of +0.65 between the
ages of men and women getting married in a certain town.
(ii) A mathematics
test we devised has been criticized on the
grounds
that
it
demands
that
students
read
verbal
de-
scriptions of problems and so gives an advantage to students
with
higher
verbal
ability. To check
the
validity of this
criticism, we try out the math
test and also a test of verbal
ability on a sample of students and calculate the coefficient
of the correlation between the two sets of scores. It
is near
zero.
(iii) A new method of measuring soil acidity has been proposed.
We test a sample of different soils, using both methods, on
two
different
occasions. The correlation between
the two
measurements using the old method
is +0.97. The correla-
tion between the two
sets of measurements with the new
method
is +0.90.
In the above cases, would you think any of the correlations were
considered satisfactory or unsatisfactory? If so, which?

Interpreting a correlation coefficient
171
In
(i)
it seemed irrelevant to regard the obtained correlation (or
any that might have been obtained) as satisfactory or unsatis-
factory. It was just a fact. In (ii) the correlation (or lack of it) was
considered satisfactory because
it indicated that the math
test
was not being 'contaminated' by testing verbal ability also. In
(iii) the correlation obtained by test-retest using the new method,
although high, was not high enough to be satisfactory compared
with that obtained from the old method.
So the correlation between the values of two variables is a fact.
Whether we regard it as strong or weak, satisfactory or otherwise,
is a matter of interpretation. Another matter of interpretation
arises when people ask whether one variable somehow causes or
determines the other. Now correlation does not imply causation.
If variables X and Y are correlated, this may be because X causes
Y, or because Y causes X, or because some other variable
is
affecting both X and Y, or for a mixture of these reasons; or the
whole relationship may be a coincidence.
For
instance,
suppose someone
points
out
that
there
is a
strong correlation between adults' intelligence-test scores and the
amount of time they have spent being educated. Does this mean
that IQ
is
* caused by' education? (In other words, can we say
that the longer a person spends in education, the larger he can
expect his IQ to become?) Possibly, but the relationship could be
working the other way round. The higher a person's IQ, the
longer he will have chosen (or been allowed) to stay in education.
If so, IQ will have 'caused' education. Or
it could be that both
these
variables (IQ
of adults and
years
spent
studying)
are
caused by an outside variable - for example, the intelligence of
the parents. That
is, the more intelligent the parents, the more
intelligent their children are likely to be and the more likely the
parents are to encourage them to prolong their education. If such
were the case, X and Y would be correlated, not because one
caused the other, but because of an outside variable, Z.
Another example:
it has been pointed out that there
is a high
positive correlation between the size of a child's hands and the

quality of his handwriting. How would you explain
it? Would
you say that:
(a) bigger hands can hold a pen more steadily? or
(b) practice in writing makes hands bigger? or
(c) there is a third variable and,
if so, what might
it be?
4c
:|c
*
4c
*
*
Of course, there
is a third variable (c) affecting both the size of a
child's hands and the quality of his writing - his age.
But very often this game of 'hunt the missing variable' will be
quite fruitless.
It may be that the relationship
is a coincidence.
For instance, there was a high positive correlation between the
proportion of marriages taking place in church and the death-
rate during the years 1866 to 191 1. That
is, in years when people
were most
likely to get married
in church (rather than
in a civil
ceremony) the death-rate was higher than in years with a smaller
proportion of church-weddings. One could rack one's brain for
explanations. Did getting married in church cause people to die
faster than they would otherwise have done? Or was it the increase
in death-rate that made people want a church-wedding more? Or
(to be subtle) was
it
that people who choose to get married
in
church are somehow weaker and therefore more likely to die than
most?
All those explanations are nonsense, of course. The variables
are quite unconnected. All they had in common was that both
were
decreasing
over
time.
During
the
years
1866
to
1911,
improved medical science and public hygiene lowered the death-
rate, while the influence of religion weakened and fewer people
thought
it necessary to get married in church.
The fact
is, any two sets of numbers that have an overall trend
upwards or downwards are likely to show some correlation if you
consider them
in
pairs. There may nevertheless be no sensible,
logical
connection
between
the two
variables.
Correlation
(a
mathematical relationship) can never prove a causal connection.
What
it does do
is give support to an explanation you can justify
on logical grounds. And clearly this explanation will carry more
weight
if you've used
it to anticipate the correlation before col-
lecting the data. Hence, correlation is often used in the first stages

Interpreting a correlation coefficient
173
of testing a theory. By checking whether two or more variables
are closely related to one another, the researcher can pin down the
factors that explain and control the variable he is interested in.
One of the first theories to be tested in this way was that human
beings inherit physical characteristics from their parents. Take, for
instance,
the theory
that
the heights of parents somehow de-
termine the heights of children. What kind of correlation would
you look for to lend support to this theory ? (Negative or positive?
Between what and what ?)
Â«

You would look
for a
high
positive correlation between
the
heights of children (when fully grown) and their parents. And you
would
find
it.
But,
of course,
the
correlation would
not
be
perfect, because there
is variation within families as well as be-
tween them. Besides, would we expect a girl's height to be cor-
related with that of her mother, and a boy's with that of his
father; or any child's to be correlated with some kind of average
of both parents' heights, or what? This leads us into a considera-
tion of just what
is implied by the size of a correlation coefficient.
Suppose we have compared the heights of a sample of sons and
their fathers and found the correlation to be +0.8. It seems reason-
able to say that the sons'
heights can, to some extent, be
* ex-
plained by' the fathers' heights. But where does the 0.8 come in?
Does this mean that 80% of a son's height was caused by
his
father's height ? Or that 80 out of every hundred sons owe their
heights to
their fathers? Or what? What does the
size of the
correlation coefficient tell us?
For
reasons which
1
won't
go
into,
it
is
accepted
that
the square of the correlation
coefficient
tells us how much of
the variation in one variable can be explained by variations in the
other. Thus, we see that 0.8 ^ = 0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64 or 64% of the
variation
in our sample of sons'
heights can be explained by
variations in their fathers' heights. Thus, 36% of the variation
is
to be explained by other factors.
Similarly, many
studies have shown
correlations between
students' SAT
scores and
their cumulative
averages
of
less
than
+0.4.

It appears that less than 16%
of the variation in grade aver-
age
is determined by aptitude, while 84%
is to be explained
by other factors (personality, diligence, motivation, luck, etc.).
Let's return to the relationship between the heights of children
and parents. We found that the heights of fathers accounted for
only 64% of the variation in heights of sons. Clearly, other factors
are at work also.
What other factor would you think
is the chief one that might
help account for the variability in the heights of sons?
*
*
:|e
Â«

Surely, the heights of mothers
is the chief other
factor. (Diet
and exercise could also have some effect.)
In
fact, we thought of this before carrying out the investiga-
tion. We checked the correlation between the sons' heights and
the mothers' heights also.
It was +0.7. This means that about
what percent of the variation in sons' heights can be explained by
variations in the heights of mothers?
*

*

He
*
*
About 49% of the variation in sons' heights can be explained by
variations in mothers' heights.
So the sons' heights were more closely related to the fathers'
heights than to the mothers'. If you had to choose,
it would be
safer to predict a particular son's height from that of his father
than from that of his mother.
*But wait a minute,'
1 hear you say. *If 64% of the variation in
sons' heights
is due to the fathers and 49% to the mothers, this
adds up to 64 + 49 = 113%, which doesn't make sense.'
A good point, and here
is the explanation. Some of the varia-
tion
in
sons'
heights
is caused
by
variations
in
fathers' and
mothers' heights acting together. There
is an overlap or inter-

Interpreting a correlation coefficient
175
action effect. The fact that the 'explained' part of the variation
in sons' heights comes to more than 100% is due to the fact that
fathers' and mothers' heights are correlated also with each other.
This
is reasonable enough. When taking marriage partners,
tall
people tend to prefer other tall people, and short people go for
short people.
As another example, consider an American study in which the
social class of families was correlated with the amount of educa-
tion of the father; and also with the 'grade' of area in which the
family
lived. The
coefficients
of correlation were
+0.78 and
-1-0.69 respectively. Were the variables 'grade of living area' and
'amount of education' correlated with each other?

Of the variation in social class, 0.78 x 0.78 = 61%
is explained
by
father's education and 0.69 x 0.69 = 48%
is explained by
{not caused by) the living area. Since 61 + 48 is more than 100%,
these two
latter variables must be correlated with each
other.'
This is surely logical, since better-educated people generally have
more money and can
live
in more 'desirable' areas than poor
people.
This technique of explaining variation in a variable
in terms
of variations in other variables
is another aspect of the analysis
of variance.
It would
lead
into several techniques (partial cor-
relation,
multiple
correlation,
factor
analysis,
cluster
analysis)
which can be of great value to researchers faced with
several
causes acting at once. However, we can't go any further in this book.
One thing you may have got from this discussion of 'explained'
and 'unexplained' variation
is some idea of how to weigh up the
size of a correlation coefficient. For instance,
it's obvious that a
correlation of, say, â0.6 between two variables
is stronger than
if the correlation were only â0.3. But is the relationship twice as
strong? Do you think that
(a) yes,
it is exactly twice as strong? or
(b) no,
it is more than twice as strong? or
(c) no,
it is less than twice as strong?

176
Analysing relationships
No, a correlation of â0.6
is more than twice as strong as one of
â0.3.
It would mean that 0.6 x 0.6 = 36% of the variation in
one variable could be explained by variation in the other variable,
rather than a mere 0.3 x 0.3 = 9%.
In other words, a doubling of the correlation coefficient means
a quadrupling of the amount of agreement
between
the two
variables concerned. This in turn means that we are dispropor-
tionately
safer
in making estimates and
predictions when r
is
larger. (Here, for instance,
in making estimates when r = â0.6
we would be four times more confident (not two times) than
if
r = -0.3).
Actually, trying to estimate or predict from one variable to
the other
is not a very rewarding business when the correlation
coefficient
is much below Â±0.80. However, smaller correlations
are more helpful than none at all. But this takes us into the field
of regression,
f
Prediction and regression
It
often happens that we have two
sets of related values (for
example, the course-work marks of a group of students and their
final exam marks), and we want to estimate or predict the value
on one variable that would correspond with a given value on the
other. For example, we know Sue Smith's course-work mark, but
for some reason she was unable to take the final exam. Can we
estimate what her mark would have been? Well,
if there were
no correlation between the two sets of marks, we could play safe
by giving her the mean of the exam marks scored by her fellow-
students. But,
if there
is any sort of correlation,
it will help us to
make a better-informed estimate. How much better depends on
the strength of the correlation.
Let's say that Sue's course-work mark
is 60. Now, suppose we
make a scatter diagram for the course-work and exam marks of
the other students. We can then see what kind of exam scores
were made by other students who scored 60 in course-work. The
range of their exam marks gives us an estimate for Sue's.

Prediction and regression
177
However, as I indicated above, the precision of this estimate
depends on the degree of correlation. For instance, either of the
two scatter diagrams below might describe the relationship. In
which case (A or B) would
it be possible to give the more precise
estimate of Sue's exam score?

scale, we see the students who scored that mark and then read
across
to see
their exam marks.
In
(A), such students scored
between 24 and 56. In (B) they scored between 28 and 44. So, if
(A)
represented
the correlation
in
Sue's group, we'd have to
estimate her exam score as 'between 24 and 56' (a range of 32);
but if (B) represented her group, our estimate would be
' between
28 and 44' (thus narrowing the range to
16).
Clearly, the
less the vertical spread of the scattered dots, the
more precise our estimates; and, of course, the less the spread, the
greater the correlation.
Perfect (100%) estimates or predictions
are possible only when all the dots
lie on a straight line (as they
did with our example of the radii and circumferences of circles).
With perfect correlation, we can say exactly what value of one
variable will go with any given value of the other.
Hence, one approach to prediction
is to
* reduce' the data to a
straight
line. We ask: *What
is the
*' underlying"
straight
line
from which
all these points deviate?' We look for the so-called
*LiNE OF BEST FIT'. This acts rather
like a measure of central
tendency, in that
it attempts to average out the variations.
Here, for example, is where I'd put the
' line of best fit
' on one of
the two scatter diagrams we just looked at.
1 could then use this
line to make a precise estimate of the exam mark corresponding
to any given course-work mark. If we took this line to represent

the
relationship, what exam mark would correspond
to Sue's
course-work mark of 60?
Â«
*
4:

The corresponding exam score would be 36.
The problem
is, of course: where does
the
line of best
fit
belong ? We can sketch
it in
* by eye
as
I did above.
I n doing so -
trying to find a sensible straight path through the dots - we must
try to judge whether, on average, the dots would deviate by as
much on one side of a possible line as they would on the other.
No easy task! And you can be sure that we'd
all draw rather
different lines of best
fit, with the result, of course, that we'd
all
make
slightly
diff"erent estimates of Sue's missing mark. And,
again, the weaker the correlation, the bigger the scatter, and the
more we'd diff'er in where we drew the line - see how difficult
it
would be to decide in the other scatter diagram on page
1 77 - and
so the more we'd
diff'er in our estimates.
Not surprisingly, then, techniques exist for calculating a posi-
tion for lines of best
fit. (They must, for example, pass through
the mean score on both variables.) Such lines are called regres-
sion LINES. The term was introduced by the nineteenth-century
British
scientist,
Francis Galton.
In
studying
the
relationship
between
the
heights of sons and
their
fathers, he found
that,
while
taller-than-average
fathers
tended
to
have
taller-than-
average sons (and smaller fathers, smaller sons), the sons tended
to be nearer the average height of all men than were their fathers.
This he called a
* regression to mediocrity' - a falling back to-
wards
the average. He and
his
friend
Karl
Pearson (who in-
troduced
the
correlation
coefficient)
developed
a
variety
of
techniques
for studying such
relationships, and
these became
known as regression techniques.
Like any other straight
line on a graph, a regression line can
be
described by an
equation.
This
is
called
a ^regression
equation'. For instance,
letting x stand
for the course-work
marks and y for the exam marks, the regression equation for the
line in the diagram above would bQ y = ix â
\1, Values of x

180
Analysing relationships
(the exam
marks)
can
then
be
estimated
directly
from
the
equation without looking at the scatter diagram any further.
Try using the equation yourself. Suppose a student made a
course-work mark (x) of 80. What would you estimate as his
exam mark (j) ?
Â«
4t
Â«
Â«
4c
Â«
Since exam marks (y) and course-work marks (x) are connected
by the regression equation y = ix â
17, a course-work mark (x)
of 80 suggests an exam mark of
y = i(80) - 17
= 70-17
= 53
As you can check from the scatter diagram, this seems to agree
with the value we'd read off, using the regression line directly.

Of course, you may well wonder at the wisdom of making
precise-looking
estimates
on
the
basis
of a
regression
line,
especially when the points are actually scattered quite far away
from
it. In
fact, any such estimate could only be stated with
honesty if accompanied by an indication of the possible error -
do you remember the idea of a confidence interval ?

An alternative approach to prediction
is to display the scatter
in a table. In our scatter diagrams so far, we have assumed that
no two members of the sample had the same pair of values, e.g.
that no two students both scored 50 on course-work and 40 in
the exam. So each dot has represented a different member of the
sample. But,
in practice, especially with large samples,
it's quite
likely that, on several occasions, a particular pair of values would
be shared by more than one member of the sample. To represent
this diagrammatically, we'd
need a three-dimensional
chart -
with columns instead of dots, varying in height according to the
number of times each
particular
pair of values was observed.
Another solution
is to use a table like the one below:

Practical marks
This table shows that, for example, of the ten students who
scored 7
in the practical
test, three scored 8 on the theory
test,
four scored
7, two scored 6 and one scored
5. We might then
predict, on the basis of this sample, that a student who scored 7
on the practical would have a
or 40% chance of scoring 7 in the
theory test. We might also point out that, although the mean theory
score of students scormg 7 on practical is 6.9, such a student has a
30% chance of scoring 8 on theory.
Again, we might notice that the mean theory score of students
scoring 5 on
practical
is
5.5. However, suppose we think of a
wider population of similar students who might have taken the
practical
test but not the theory.
If we can generalize from the

182
Analysing relationships
sample in this table, what
is the probability that such a student
who scored 5 on the practical will score
(i) less than 5; (ii) more
than 5 on the theory test ?******
Of the twenty students who scored 5 on practical, five scored less
than 5 on theory and eleven scored more. So the probability of
a student with 5 on practical scoring (i) less than that on theory
is
oi)- or 25%, while the probability of his scormg
(ii) more
is
or 55%.
Notice that the table makes clear the evidence on which our
prediction
is based. While a precise estimate can be offered (e.g.
the mean
score),
the probability of greater or
lesser scores
is
plainly visible.
If we were to draw such a table for a large sample, covering
as wide a mark-range (0-100) as we envisaged for the pairs of
course-work/exam marks, we'd probably group the data. Thus, as
youMI
see
in
the example below, one
cell
might show
that
6
students scored between 60 and 69 on course-work and between
50 and 59 on the exam. Precise information
is lost. We no longer
show exactly what course-work mark and exam mark each of these
students obtained. But the data are easier to handle, and the only
precision lost in the estimates we'd make is a fairly spurious kind
of precision anyway.

Sue, with her course-work score of 60, would obviously be
compared with one of the twenty students in the '60-69' column.
It would seem that there is only a ^20^ ^ ^ ^

of her having made the same score or higher on the final exam.
Indeed, there
is a 2^ or 20% chance that she may have scored as
low as 30-39. There is even a -g-Q- or 5% chance that her exam score
may be between 20 and 29. What is her most likely exam score;
and what is its probability?
Â«
*
iie
4c
He
Sue's most
likely exam
score
is 50-59 marks. Of the twenty
students comparable with her on course-work marks, more (6)
fell into that exam-mark range than into any other - the proba-
bility of such a score is
or 30%. (Sue also benefits from the way
we happen to have grouped the marks.
If she'd scored 59 rather
than 60, she'd have fallen in the 50-59 class-work group, and her
most likely exam score would be only 40-^9.)
Don't
forget, however,
that we have a very
limited sample:
only twenty students in Sue's range of course-work marks. Yet
we wish to generalize to such students in general, and to Sue in
particular. Sue, for all we know, may have special qualities that
would enable her to score 100 in the exam. It appears improbable,
but
it remains possible.
This seems a suitable point
at which
to begin drawing
this
book
to a conclusion. For we are back where we began,
dis-
tinguishing between samples and populations, and asking how
reasonable
it
is to generalize from one to the other. And,
in any
case, what are the risks in predicting for just one individual (Sue)
from the population? Statistics, as I'm sure you'll have gathered,
is far better equipped to make inferences about things
' in general
and *in the long run' than about particular things on a particular
occasion.
This,
though,
is one of
its most
important
lessons.
Human
beings
are bound
to
generalize,
expecting
to
see
the
characteristics, diff'erences, trends and associations we have noted
in one instance to be repeated
in apparently similar instances.
Without some
such
expectation
of constancy, we
could
not

184
Analysing relationships
survive. But
all such expectations must be hedged about with
probability. They must
be
tentative rather than
absolute. We
must expect them to be confounded much of the time. Unless we
can, to some extent at
least, expect things to be different from
what we expect, then we cannot learn from experience. And that
is also a path to stagnation and extinction.

Postscript
In
the preceding pages I've been very much aware that we've
been skimming the surface of most
issues. This
is because my
aim was to give you a bird's-eye-view of the field of statistical
concepts, rather than take you crawling, like a calculating snake,
through the undergrowth of statistical computation.
If you
feel
I've raised more questions
in your mind than I've answered,
I
shan't be surprised or apologetic. The library shelves groan with
the weight of the books
in which
you'll find answers to such
questions (see the Bibliography, pages 191-5). Even though you'll
be well aware that statistics
is a subject with ramifications and
inter-connections far beyond anything we've discussed here, you
should be pretty confident that you've *got the feel' of its main
lines of concern.
If you have worked through the book to this point, you should
now have a
basic grasp of the concepts and terminology of
statistics.
It should be of great help to you
in:
(1) reading a
research
report
(or a newspaper) with some expectation
that
you'll
see
the
point of any
statistics
it may contain;
(2)
de-
scribing your research
interests to a professional statistician
in
terms that would enable him to offer you technical advice; and
(3) turning to books or courses on statistical calculation with a
view to learning the techniques yourself.
Unless you have to pass an exam
in statistics, you may well
need little more than you have already learned. Although students
in many subjects must take courses
in
statistics, much of what
they are taught often seems of doubtful relevance to their other
activities. Certainly research has shown (if it can be relied upon!)
that social scientists tend to retain only a partial knowledge of the
statistics they were taught. But perhaps they remember all that
185

186
Postscript
is useful to them. For when social scientists do make liberal use of
statistics in their research reports, one often gets the impression
they are being used to make the work look more 'scientific' (and
therefore believable) rather than to clarify
its meaning.
To conclude, TU
briefly review the
* bird's-eye-view* and add
a final note of caution.
Review
Statistics
is a means of coming to conclusions
in
the
face of
uncertainty.
It enables us
to recognize and evaluate the errors
involved in quantifying our experience, especially when general-
izing from what
is known of some small group (a sample) to some
wider group (the population).
Statistical analysis begins
in a description of the sample. We
may find diagrams a revealing way of describing a sample and
comparing
it with other
distributions.
But we are
particularly
interested
in getting a measure of the sample's central tendency
and, where appropriate, a measure of its dispersion. The two most
important
such
measures
(with
quantity-variables)
are
the
arithmetic
mean
and
the
standard
deviation.
These
are
of
particular value in defining the normal distribution: a symmetri-
cal, bell-shaped curve.
Once we have the mean and the standard deviation, we can
compare values from two different distributions (in z-units) and
we can estimate the percentage of observations in a distribution
that would
fall above and below various values of the variable.
We can
also
infer parameter values
(in the population) based
upon
the
statistics
(from
the
sample),
using
the
concept
of
standard error to decide the confidence interval within which we
believe the true population value (e.g. a mean or a proportion) to
lie. We would commonly quote a range
in which we are 95%
certain the true value
lies, or a wider one about which we can be
99% confident.
Following the same principles, we can compare two (or more)
samples, and ask whether they are sufficiently similar to have come

Review
187
from the same population. Or is the difference between them big
enough
to
signify a
real
difference
in populations - one that
would be repeated in subsequent pairs of samples chosen in the
same way? We make a null hypothesis that the samples come
from
the same population and
that
the
difference has arisen
purely by chance. Tests enable us to determine the plausibility of
this
hypothesis.
If the
probability of
getting two samples so
different from one population
is less than 5%, we may reject the
hypothesis.
If we want to be more careful
still, we may prefer
not to reject the null hypothesis (i.e. not recognize the difference
as a real one) unless it is so big that its probability in two samples
from the same population
is
less than 1%. Such differences are
said to be significant (even though they may not be important in
any practical sense).
There are also tests to establish whether there appears to be
a significant difference anywhere among a group of more than
two samples. This involves the analysis of variance: comparing
the variance between groups with
the variance within groups.
When dealing with categories rather than with quantity-variables,
and
asking whether
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
two samples
in proportions rather than means, we use a non-
parametric technique called the chi-square
test. This compares
the frequency with which we'd expect
certain
observations to
occur,
if chance only were operating, with the frequency
that
actually
occurred.
(Such
non-parametric
techniques
are
es-
sential when dealing with category-variables and may in other
cases be advisable when we can't be sure that the parent popula-
tion
Is normally distributed.)
Finally, we are often
interested
in
the relationship between
related pairs of values from two different variables (for example,
people's heights and weights)
Correlation
is a measure ot such
relationship and the correlation coefficient indicates
its strength-
on a
scale irom â1 and +1
(equally
strong) down
to
zero.
Scatter diagrams are a useful way of displaying correlation, but
may need to be replaced by tables when the same pair of values is
recorded
for
several members of the sample. With
regression
techniques, we can use the relationship observed in the sample to

188
Postscript
predict,
for the population, values of one variable that would
correspond with given values of the other variable. The
likely
accuracy of such predictions increases with the strength of the
correlation.
Even
when
the
correlation
is
very
strong
and
predictions are firm, we cannot use that
fact to prove that one
variable causes the other, even
if we can explain a causal con-
nection. Variable X may cause variable Y, or vice versa, or both
may be determined by another variable, Z, or the mathematical
relationship may be a coincidence. As usual in statistics, however,
the data would lend support (or deny
it) to a reasoned argument
along one of these lines, but absolute proof is never forthcoming.
Caution
Finally, a few words of caution.
It has been pointed out, over
and over again, that:
* There are lies, damned lies, and statistics!'
or
* Figures don't
lie but
liars use figures!' or,
less hysterically
(but despite what
1 said at the end of the last paragraph)
' You
can prove anything with statistics.' How to Lie with Statistics
by Darrell Huff and Irving Gels (Norton, 1954)
is the classic
book on this topic; the warnings
it conveys are both deadly
serious and amusingly presented.
in
general,
it
is well
to remember that a person who uses
statistics may be someone with an axe
to
grind. He may be
propping up a weak case with rather dubious figures which he
hopes will impress or intimidate any potential critics. For example,
a British politician recently claimed
that *50% more
teachers
considered that educational standards had fallen rather than risen
over the previous five years.' This pronouncement
is worrying
but rather obscure: 50% more
.
.
. than what ? In fact, it was based
on a survey in which 36% of the teachers believed that standards
of pupil achievement had
fallen, 24% believed they had
risen,
32% believed they had remained the same, and 8% didn't know.
Clearly,
the
politician
ignored
the
* stayed
the same' and the
'don't know' groups (a cool 40% of the sample) to arrive at his
'50% more' figures. Had he wished to propagate a rosier view

Caution
189
of British educational standards, he might, with equal validity,
have
pointed
out
that no
less than 64% of teachers do
not
believe that standards have fallen. On the other hand, he might
have painted an even
blacker
picture by saying
that 76% of
teachers do not believe standards have risen!
But please don't think that untrustworthy statistics are found
only
in the rantings of politicians and the cajolements of ad-
vertisers. Just
this week, as
1 put the finishing touches to
this
chapter, the leading French opinion poll stands accused of sup-
pressing the fact that 77% of the French people polled thought
that immigrants should be sent home; and publishing instead
the false figure of 57% - a figure that would be more acceptable
to their clients (the French government).
Even scientific researchers are subject to human failings. They
are most unlikely to attempt out-and-out deception - though the
life-work of a famous, recently deceased British psychologist
is
currently alleged by some critics to be based on fraudulent ex-
perimental and
statistical
data. But even they may get carried
away by the desire to 'prove' a pet theory and,
in the process,
overlook the inadequacy or bias in a particular sample, or choose
inappropriate
tests or
insufficiently
stringent
levels of
signifi-
cance. Studies of journal
articles
(in
the psychology
field,
for
example) have indicated many such
lapses.
Indeed, a
* classic'
1971 study by a Finnish medical researcher (which suggested that
one's chance of heart disease would be reduced by eating vege-
table margarine rather than butter) is now being attacked for just
such statistical weaknesses.
Of course, you cannot be expected
to
sniff* out
the
trans-
gressors. You simply do not have sufficient technical expertise.
Nor do
I want to encourage you to be unduly suspicious. Your
problem will chiefly lie in understanding and interpreting people's
statistics, not
in trying to catch them. At the same time, your
interpretation
will
be
colored
by what you
have
learned
in
this book:
for instance the
possibility of bias
in samples, the
distinction between
significance and importance,
the
fact
that
correlation does not imply causation, and so on. Needless to say,
if you should find yourself producing statistics for other people,

190
Postscript
to back up an argument of your own,
I assume you will strive
for all the honesty you'd wish for from others.
Jn short: as a consumer of statistics, act with caution; as a
producer, act with integrity.

Bibliography
Here
is a small (and not
at
all random!)
sample from
the
vast population of books in which you might follow up what
you have learned so far.
I begin with a small 'general' section,
listing books that should be helpful to the reader who wants
to go
a
little
bit
further.
I
follow
this with
sections
listing
books that apply
statistical thinking
to each of several
par-
ticular subject-areas. This
is not to imply, however, that such
books could be of help only to students of the subject under
which they are
listed. You might well find the exposition of
some authors to be so good that you'd be prepared
to over-
look the fact that their examples were not drawn from your
subject.
(In any
case, my
classification has
to be somewhat
arbitrary, since some of the books could appear in more than
one category.) However, what
I am assuming really
is
that,
having endured my general introduction, you'll be most con-
cerned
to hear from authors who
tackle problems
in your
own subject-area.
