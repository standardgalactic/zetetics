When five-year old 
Luisa writes her name, she 
proudly announces each 
letter in turn and carefully 
adds a curlicue for good 
measure. “It’s cursive,” she 
explains. Luisa recognizes 
that these lines and shapes 
are something special and delights in her growing knowledge of the alphabet. 
As Luisa continues to learn about letters, she will develop the alphabet 
recognition skills that are essential for learning to read. Luisa is happily on 
her way to becoming a reader and building a strong foundation that predicts 
future school success.
Alphabet recognition—knowing the names for letters and the sounds they 
represent—begins for many young children with the familiar song, “A, B, C, 
D, E, F, G… .” As children sing the alphabet song again and again, they learn 
the letter names, an important first step for alphabet recognition. But children 
also need to learn the printed form of each letter (uppercase and lowercase, 
in and out of sequence) and the most frequent sound each letter represents. 
Research shows that speed and accuracy are two important factors in alphabet 
recognition. Children who can recognize letters with speed and accuracy 
can more efficiently focus on sound-letter relationships as they learn to read 
(Adams, 1990; as cited in Blevins, 2006). Over-learning the letters—their 
names, shapes, and sounds—is recommended for achieving this goal. 
Instant Practice Packets: Alphabet provides the repeated practice children 
need to thoroughly learn the letters of the alphabet. These ready-to-go, 
reproducible packets—one for each letter—are designed to help children 
build a foundation for early reading success. The format and sequence of 
activities on the pages support children in working independently.
Teaching 
Tip
Pages 1 and 2 of each 
packet feature letter-
formation practice.  
For children who are  
left-handed, consider 
writing the target letter 
at the end (right side) 
of each practice line to 
provide a model they can 
easily see as they trace 
and write the letters.
Introduction

Instant Practice Packets: Alphabet  •  © 2011 by Joan Novelli & Holly Grundon  •  Scholastic Teaching Resources
In addition to letter recognition activities, opportunities to practice letter 
formation are an important component of each packet. In writing letters of 
the alphabet, children begin to notice the different features of letters (such 
as height, straight and curved lines, intersecting lines, and loops), which 
“significantly helps letter recognition” (Clay, 2002, 2006). From tracing and 
writing letters to turning them into works of art, letter formation activities are 
built into each page. Additional highlights for each packet include:
•	 multisensory activities that reflect research about the 
way young children learn—for example, the hand-sign 
component of each packet adds a kinesthetic connection 
•	 activities that provide necessary practice with letter 
recognition in isolation as well as in the context of words
•	 key pictures and words that help children learn letter-sound 
relationships
•	 predictable text that features each target letter to help 
children take the next step in becoming readers
•	 kid-friendly layouts that keep interest high
Teaching With the  
Alphabet Packets
The packets in this book are organized in alphabetical order, but can be 
used in any sequence to meet your instructional needs. To prepare the packets 
for use, photocopy the pages and staple to bind. Introduce the packets by 
“walking” through each page with children. Review each activity and model 
how to complete it. The packets allow children to work at their own pace, and 
taking time in advance to review directions will facilitate their independence. 
Following is an overview of each page.
Page 1: The first page of each packet introduces the target letter and 
provides guided practice with letter formation. In addition, children 
explore different letter styles (through a variety of fonts) and take a turn 
creating a letter style all their own! (Encourage creativity as children 
Research shows that 
“supporting literacy and 
language skills in the 
first language provides 
a base for successful 
literacy development in 
the second language” 
(Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 
1998, as cited by 
Northwest Regional 
Educational Laboratory, 
2005). One way to 
implement that strategy 
using the packets is to 
give English Language 
Learners opportunities 
to teach others how to 
say the letter names and 
words for pictures in their 
first language.

“design” a new way to write the letter.) They also learn that hand signs are 
another way to form letters and can practice making the hand sign for the 
target letter. This kinesthetic component helps further reinforce children’s letter 
learning experiences.
Page 2: The top section of this page gives children 
continued practice in letter-writing. At the bottom, 
children take a “Letter Walk,” which engages them in 
noticing similarities and differences among letters as 
they identify uppercase and lowercase examples of the 
target letter along a path. 
Page 3: With an alphabet-book-like setup, this page 
features pictures and words that help children learn 
the sound commonly associated with the target letter. 
Children trace the letter and write it to complete the word 
for each picture. To reinforce sound-letter relationships, 
encourage children to say the name for each letter as 
they trace or write it and the word for the picture. In 
the final section on this page, children draw their own 
picture to represent the letter and write (or dictate) the 
word. Note: In the case of the letter x, the pictures on page 
3 illustrate words in which x appears as a final consonant. 
(Words with x at the beginning are generally too advanced for this purpose.)
Page 4: “Star Words” introduces children to words that 
begin with (or end with, in the case of the letter x) the 
target letter, including many from sight-word vocabulary 
lists (such as Dolch and Fry). Children trace the letters 
to spell four words, then color the stars to show 
which of those words they can read. As an extension, 
you might build a wall chart of the Star Words from 
each packet. To use the chart, point out and read the 
words with children frequently to support acquisition 
of sight-word vocabulary. Other features on this page include “Animal ABCs” 
and “doodle.” With Animal ABCs, children practice writing the target letter to 
complete the name of an animal. The predictable text in this activity encourages 
early reading skills. The doodle activity invites children to form the letter, then 
have fun transforming it into a picture. This exercise encourages a playfulness 
that motivates further learning.
Instant Practice Packets: 
Alphabet offers effective 
support for Response 
to Intervention (RTI). For 
example, children who 
do not have adequate 
knowledge of the 
alphabet and therefore 
struggle academically 
with reading may benefit 
from the systematic 
approach the packets 
provide—from letter-
writing practice that 
draws attention to 
important features of 
each letter to picture-
word combinations 
that reinforce letter-
sound relationships. 
Additionally, the 
formatted practice  
pages make it easy  
for these learners to 
focus on specific skills.

Using the Supplemental  
Reproducible Activity Pages
The supplemental activities (pages 115–128) are designed to provide the repetition 
children need to strengthen alphabet recognition skills. A review of these pages, along 
with suggestions for teaching with the activities, follows.
Letter Formation Practice Template (page 115)
Customize this page to provide additional letter-writing practice for up to five different 
letters. First, photocopy the page and write the target letter at the beginning of the line 
to provide a model for children. Then make copies for children to complete. 
Letter Cards (pages 116–119)
Copy and laminate sets of these uppercase and lowercase letter cards for an endless 
variety of activities that will actively engage children in learning the alphabet. 
Suggestions follow.
Letter Buddies: Copy the uppercase letter cards; leave the page intact. Copy the 
lowercase letter cards and cut them apart. Mix up the lowercase letters and have 
children match each card to the corresponding uppercase letter. Alternately, have 
children match the uppercase letter cards to an intact page of lowercase letters. 
Big and Little Letter Match: Have children use the cards to play Concentration. 
Pre-select and cut out a set of 8–10 uppercase and lowercase letter pairs for children 
to match in the game. (Using the entire set of cards may be too challenging for  
some children.) 
Alphabet Soup: Copy and cut apart a set of uppercase and lowercase letter cards. Label 
two paper bowls (on the inside) “BIG LETTERS” and “little letters.” Write a few uppercase 
and lowercase letters on each bowl to provide visual support. Mix up the uppercase and 
lowercase letter cards and have children sort them into the corresponding bowls.
Letter Line Up: Provide either a set of uppercase or lowercase letter cards. Mix up the 
cards and have children line them up in alphabetical order. Children can work with a partner, 
taking turns to find each letter. If they like, they can use a one-minute (or more) timer

and see how many cards they can place in alphabetical order before time runs out (and 
with continued practice, notice how that number grows). Encourage children to sing the 
alphabet song as they work to help figure out which letter comes next.
Before and After: Copy two sets of cards (either uppercase or lowercase), each on a 
different color paper. Spread out one set of cards faceup on a table. Shuffle the second set 
and stack the cards facedown. Have children take turns selecting the top card from the 
stack, placing it faceup, naming the letter, then searching the cards that are spread out to 
find the letter that comes before and the letter that comes after it. (For A and Z, children 
can find the two letters that come immediately after or before). When finished, children 
return the “before and after” cards to the table and place the card from the stack to  
the side.
Alphabet Mini-Book (pages 120-122)
This interactive mini-book is designed to extend learning for each packet. To prepare 
the mini-book, write the target letter in the box provided on the cover and on pages 1–3 
before making copies for children. Cut apart the mini-book pages and arrange them in 
order, then staple to bind. Suggestions for teaching with each page follow.
Cover: Have children write their name in the space at the 
bottom, then color the picture if they wish.
Page 1: This page provides letter formation practice. Write 
tracing letters as needed at the beginning of each practice line. Give 
children a star sticker (or stamp) to place next to their best letter. 
Page 2: This activity helps children learn to recognize letters 
that appear in different fonts, sizes, and colors. To complete the 
page, have children search for examples of the target letter in 
magazines, newspapers, and old workbook pages. Have them cut 
out the letters and glue them in the box to create a letter collage.
Page 3: Have children write a large version of the letter in the 
center of the big box. Model how to trace the letter in one color, 
then write the letter again with three more colors, each time 
tracing closely around the outside of the previous color to create 
a “rainbow.”

Page 4: The activity on this page strengthens alphabet and sequencing skills. To 
prepare, write the target letter in one of the four boxes, keeping in mind that children 
will fill in the letters that come just before and/or after. For example, if the target letter is 
A, write the letter A in the first box. Children will then write the next three letters. If the 
target letter is Z, write that letter in the last box so that children can fill in the preceding 
three letters. You can write target letters such as D, E, and F in any of the boxes since 
there are at least three letters before and after that children can fill in. [Note: You might 
program this page before making copies for children.]
Page 5: This activity helps children make a connection between letters and words, as 
they hunt for words that contain the target letter and copy them onto the page. After 
children complete their mini-books, read the words on this page together to reinforce 
sound-letter associations.
Missing Letters Game (pages 123-127)
This write-and-erase game provides the repetition children need to learn to recognize  
and write the letters of the alphabet. Two versions of the game board offer practice 
separately for both uppercase and lowercase letter forms. Children may play the  
game independently, with a partner, or with a small group (up to four players).  
Follow the steps outlined below to prepare the game for use. (For materials and 
directions for play, see page 125.)
1. 	 Copy the game boards on pages 123 and 124 (enlarge first if desired). Color 
each game board for added visual appeal, then laminate. 
2. 	 Make multiple copies of the game directions, game cards, and the blank game card 
template (pages 125–127). Laminate the directions and at least four game cards 
for each game set. (Each player needs a game card, but the cards do not have to be 
different.) Use the game card template to create new game cards as desired.
3. 	 When not in use, store materials for each game set in a large resealable bag. 
Alphabet Hand Signs Mini-Poster (page 128)
This reproducible mini-poster revisits the hand signs featured in each packet to 
provide children with a complete set of the alphabet. Children can practice each 
hand sign in turn as they sing the alphabet song and use the hand signs to finger 
spell familiar words, such as their names. Display the mini-poster in the classroom 
or make an individual copy for each child.

•	 Number cube or die
•	 Game card  
(one per player)
•	 Game marker  
(one per player)
•	 Dry erase pen  
(one per player)
•	 Paper towels 
1.	 Choose a game marker. Place it on any “letter” space. (Players may 
share a space.)
2.	 Take turns rolling the number cube. Move that number of spaces (in any 
direction), then follow the directions on the space, as indicated below:
• “Letter” space: Check your game card for that letter of the 
alphabet. Write the letter in the correct place if it is missing. 
• “Free” space: Fill in any one missing letter on your game card.
• “Move ahead…” or “Move back…” space: Move as directed  
and check your game card for that letter. Write the letter, if it  
is missing.
3.	 Keep playing until one player fills in all missing letters on his 
or her game card (or play until all players complete their cards).  
Erase your game card and play again.
