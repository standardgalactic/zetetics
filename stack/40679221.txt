 ABSTRACT
 After reviewing the most important aspects of the cosmic-string model of formation of stru
 recent results on galaxy formation are summarized. The origin of galactic angular momentum
 tidal torquing is discussed, and the evolution of the mass function of galaxies is studied.
 Key words: cosmology-cosmic strings-galaxy formation
 I. Introduction
 There are two basic aspects to any theory of formation
 of structure: a source of primordial energy density pertur-
 bations and the specification of the dark matter.
 I shall follow popular theoretical prejudice and assume
 that the universe is flat, i.e., Í1 = 1. Since only a small
 fraction of this mass can be in baryons (based on the
 constraints from nucleosynthesis, see, e.g., Yang et al.
 1984), there must be nonbaryonic dark matter. Roughly,
 we can distinguish two types of dark matter: hot dark
 matter (e.g., 30-eV neutrinos) which has large thermal
 velocities (close to relativistic) at the time of equal matter
 and radiation teq, and cold dark matter (e.g., axions)
 which has negligible velocities at teq.
 There must be a source of primordial energy density
 perturbations. Roughly speaking, we can again distin-
 guish two classes of initial fluctuations: random-phase
 adiabatic perturbations and nonrandom-phase nonadia-
 batic perturbations. Figure 1 is an attempt to emphasize
 the difference between the two. Random-phase adiabatic
 perturbations can be viewed as fluctuations in the dark
 matter which are plane waves of various wavelengths
 superposed with random phases. Nonrandom-phase
 nonadiabatic perturbations are fluctuations in the matter
 field which is not the dark matter and which look like
 delta-function perturbations of various strengths. The
 point perturbations can be either accretion seeds or ex-
 plosion seeds.
 The above discussion has been oversimplified. There
 are other possible initial fluctuation scenarios. Besides
 adiabatic plane-wave perturbations there are isothermal
 and isocurvature fluctuations, etc. Instead of trying to
 give a complete listing of the different types of fluctua-
 tions I shall mention the important connection with parti-
 cle physics. The simplest inflationary universe models
 (Guth 1981) (those with a single scalar field) produce

 adiabatic random-phase perturbations with a scale invari-
 ant spectrum (for a review see, e.g., Brandenberger
 1987), models with cosmic strings (for a review see
 Vilenkin 1985) give nonadiabatic nonrandom-phase per-
 turbations. Ordinary cosmic strings yield accretion seeds
 (Turok and Brandenberger 1986; Sato 1986; Stebbins
 1986); superconducting cosmic strings (Witten 1985) may
 yield explosion seeds (Ostriker, Thompson, and Witten
 1986).
 The "cold dark-matter model" (for a review see, e.g.,
 Blumenthal et al. 1984) is based on random-phase adia-
 batic perturbations from inflation and cold dark matter;
 the cosmic-string model of formation of structure can be
 considered with either cold dark matter or hot dark mat-
 ter. The reader should be warned that from particle
 physics there is no overwhelming reason for one or the
 other mechanism - neither is inevitable. However, one
 pragmatic reason for studying the cosmic-string model of
 galaxy formation is that it is based on a fluctuation spec-
 trum which in the way indicated above is opposite to the
 well-studied "cold dark-matter model", and by studying it
 one can learn which predictions are model independent
 and which are the most sensitive to variations of the
 model.
 The focus of this article will be galaxy formation with
 cosmic strings. Both hot and cold dark-matter models will
 be considered. Of the many aspects of galaxy formation I
 shall focus only on two: the origin of angular momentum
 and the evolution of the mass function. Other important
 aspects such as the correlation function (Turok 1985)
 and the density profile (Zurek 1986; Brandenberger et al.

 1987; Dobyns 1988; Bertschinger and Watts 1988) have
 been discussed elsewhere in the literature. The work
 summarized here was done in collaboration with E. P. S.
 Shellard (Brandenberger and Shellard 1988).
 In Section III I shall discuss angular-momentum gener-
 ation via tidal torquing. In the cosmic-string model with
 cold dark matter the effect is large enough to explain the
 observed large angular momentum of spiral galaxies,
 whereas for hot dark matter tidal torquing is not sufficient
 to explain the observations.
 In Section IV I discuss the mass function of galaxies in
 the cosmic-string model. With hot dark matter the mass
 function computed using heuristic arguments has slope
 -3/2 and is, hence, in good agreement with the Shechter
 luminosity function. With cold dark matter the mass func-
 tion computed at the heuristic level has slope -5/2, much
 too steep to match observations. However, for cold dark
 matter, competition between string loops and mergers
 are important effects which change the mass function. I
 summarize recent work which shows that there is a sub-
 stantial evolution of the mass function between redshift
 z = 10 and the present time. The final mass function is in
 good agreement with observations.
 II. Cosmic- String Review
 In this section I shall summarize the features of the
 cosmic-string model which are most important for cos-
 mology. Cosmic strings are lines in space of trapped
 energy density p. The dimensions of these strings are
 unusual: The energy per unit length (x is about 1015 tons
 cm"1; the width is about 10~22 of the radius of a hydrogen
 atom. The pressure in the direction of the string is -p.
 In particle-physics models, which admit cosmic strings,
 a network of strings forms during a phase transition in the
 very early universe, typically about 10"35 s after the big
 bang. In order to study cosmological implications we
 must evolve the cosmic-string network until a time feq ~
 1011 s, the time of equal matter and radiation. This extrap-
 olation is only possible because the network of cosmic
 strings approaches a "fixed point", the so-called scaling
 solution (Kibble 1985; Albrecht and Turok 1985; Bennet
 and Bouchet 1988).
 The scaling solution states that at any time t there is of

 the order one infinite string segment per horizon volume.
 The network of infinite strings can be viewed as a collec-
 tion of random walks with curvature radius t , each seg-
 ment having a large velocity. When two string segments
 hit they do not cross but intercommute, as sketched in
 Figure 2. Hence, loops are produced. Up to a constant v
 the density of loops with radius R is well determined by
 this process. Loops of radius R are created at time t ~ R,
 and the density at the time of production is n(R) ~ fí~4.
 For t > R the number density simply redshifts. Hence,
 today in the radius range of interest for galaxy formation
 n(R)~R~5/2 , (1)
 where n(R)dR is the number density in 
 the radius interval [fí,fí + dR].
 Cosmic strings form accretion seeds for 
 as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Accreti

 [n>R{d)]d3 = 1 . (2)
 Here n>R is the number density of loops with r
 greater than R. Since this argument depends only on
 number density it is independent of (x and of th
 matter.
 The arguments given so far assume that there is no
 competition between loops and no merging of structures.
 Under this assumption it is easy to derive the mass func-
 tion of galaxies. For cold dark matter the mass 3K(R)
 accreted around a loop of radius R is proportional to R.
 Hence the mass function is
 n(m)~m-5/2 , (3)

 1988). We get Hft(fí) ~ fí3 which implies
 nP)~äT3/2 . (4)
 An easy way to see this is to calculate the radius r(fí) for
 which Ô372/272 = 1. Since the excess mass inside r is
 m(r) ~ fìr2 , (5)
 r (fí ) is proportional to fí, and thus by equation (5) the total
 nonlinear mass is proportional to fí3.
 In Section IV I shall show that for cold dark matter
 competition between loops and merging becomes impor-
 tant and, hence, the final mass function differs sharply
 from equation (3). For hot dark matter the above effects
 are much less important.
 III. Angular Momentum From Tidal Torquing
 Tidal torquing as the source of angular momentum of
 galaxies has been studied in the context of models with
 random-phase perturbations by Peebles (1969), White
 (1984), and Barnes and Efstathiou (1987). Here I shall
 show that tidal torquing can generate enough galactic
 angular momentum to explain observations in the cosmic-
 string model, provided the dark matter is cold.
 The mechanism is sketched in Figure 4. If galaxies are
 elliptical rather than spherical the gravitational forces
 between nearest neighbors generate torques and, hence,
 angular momenta. In the cosmic-string theory the eccen-
 tricity of a galaxy is generated by the accretion onto
 moving loops (Bertschinger 1987). The resulting eccen-
 tricity e is of the order 1. The distance between nearest-

 teq
 where the spatial integral runs over the virialized region
 and the force density F(x, t ') has amplitude
 F(x,t') = Gm(t')9(x)d-2(x,t') . (7)
 Here m(t ') is the mass of the galaxy exerting the force and
 p(x) is the density at point x. Expanding d(x, t ) as
 d(x,t) = d(t)(l+-^j , (8)
 we observe that on substituting equations (7) and (8) into
 equation (6) the dipole term vanishes. The quadrupole
 term gives the dominant contribution. The integral (eq.
 (6)) is dominated by the time t{ when all free gas has been
 accreted onto some loop. Thereafter, the integrand de-
 creases in time as z~3(t) since masses and radii are con-
 stant. Before tf, masses and radii increase as t and hence
 the integrand increases. Thus, we can roughly evaluate
 equation (6) as
 L-'g t(xn(t() iti(íf)R2 (íf) d'%) e(íf) , (9)
 where tft and fi are mass and virialized radius of the galaxy
 acquiring angular momentum.
 The separation between nearest neighbor galaxies can
 be parameterized as
 d = d(R)/N0 , (10)
 where d (fi) is the mean separation betw

 masses, radii, and correlation functions by
 N0=10N10 , (12)

 and

 For hot dark matter the masses and radii are typi
 one order of magnitude smaller. In addition, the tor

 turn. The result is
 L ~ 1070 cm2 g s"1 (I mh Ro2ol tf¿) . (15)
 We conclude that in the cosmic-string model with cold
 dark matter, tidal torquing can explain the observed an-
 gular momenta of up to 1075 cm2 g s"1 in spirals. For hot
 dark matter the answer is negative, and we need a differ-
 ent mechanism for explaining the angular momenta of
 spiral galaxies.
 IV. Evolution of the Mass Function
 In the cosmic-string model with cold dark matter, the
 assumption that all string loops accrete mass indepen-
 dently up to t0 breaks down. Under the assumption of
 independent accretion, the energy density virialized
 about strings is
 t
 p(i) = jdR n(R,t) ß|üL R zeq z-1 (t) . (16)
 7G|lfeq
 ß ~ 10 is a constant which gives the length of a loop in
 terms of its mean radius (Alb recht and Turok 1985). The
 lower cutoff on loops comes from gravitational radiation
 (see, e.g., Vilenkin 1985). p(t ) is equal to the total energy
 density p0 at a redshift z (tf) - 10. For hot dark matter, p(f)
 ~ 10" * p0 at the present time t0.
 Since competition between loops and merging will
 inevitably be important for the cosmic-string model with
 cold dark matter we must be more careful in calculating
 the mass function. I shall summarize the results of some
 recent work (Brandenberger and Shellard 1988).
 We first analytically calculated the mass function at the
 redshift z (t{) = 10 in a model with cosmic strings and cold
 dark matter. We must incorporate the fact that many
 small loops are inside the turnaround radius of larger
 loops. Let F(R) be the fraction of space inside the
 turnaround radius of loops with radius > R. The number
 density of loops which give rise to independent structures
 (and hence determine the mass function) is then given by
 A(R) = n(R)(l-F(R)) . (17)
 Evaluated at z(t{) = 10 we get the mass function shown in
 Figure 5. We checked the results by numerical simula-
 tions. The analytical and numerical results agree within
 the statistical errors of the numerical simulations.
 As a second step we studied the evolution of the mass
 function for z < 10 numerically, using an N-body code
 developed by E. P. S. Shellard (1988). The N bodies are N
 string, loops (the accreted mass included). The distribu-
 tion of radii is given by equation (17), and neither nonran-
 dom correlations nor nonvanishing peculiar velocities are
 included. The code is a "sticky particle" code. Two bodies
