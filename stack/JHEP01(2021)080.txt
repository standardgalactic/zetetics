Abstract: We compute sigma model solutions for rigidly rotating open strings suspended
between giant gravitons in general LLM geometries. These solutions are conﬁned to the
LLM plane. These all have a dispersion relation for ∆−J that is consistent with saturation
of a BPS bound of the centrally extended spin chain. For the special case of circularly
symmetric LLM geometries, we can further evaluate the amount of angular momentum
J carried by these strings. This quantity diverges for string conﬁgurations that try to
move between diﬀerent “coloring regions” in the LLM plane. All of these quantities have
a perturbative expansion in the t’Hooft coupling. For the strings suspended between AdS
giants, we can compute in ﬁeld theory the leading result of J carried by the string via an
analytic continuation of the SU(2) result, with the help of the Bethe Ansatz for the SL(2)
sector. We thus provide additional information on how the radial direction of AdS arises
from (open) spin chain calculations.

Introduction
The AdS/CFT correspondence has established an equivalence between some theories of
quantum gravity in asymptotically AdS spacetimes and certain gauge theories. The most
celebrated example is the equivalence between IIB string theory on AdS5 × S5 and N = 4
SYM theory [1].
The free strings propagating on the AdS5×S5 background are believed to be integrable
for all values of the t’Hooft coupling. A review of the main results in this direction can
be found in [2]. On the ﬁeld theory side, the integrability takes the form of a spin chain
Hamiltonian [3, 4].
The spin chain acts on the list of gauge invariant local operators,
the states being generated by traces of words of local ﬁelds of N = 4 SYM and their
derivatives. Finding the energy spectrum on the spin chain side corresponds to computing
the eigenvalues of the matrix of anomalous dimension of the operators in N = 4 SYM.
Integrability, combined with supersymmetry is very powerful. A particularly important
result that combines the two is the dispersion relation for magnons on the gauge theory spin
chain [5]. It follows from a central extension in the symmetry algebra of the spin chain and
from the fact that magnons are in short representations of the centrally extended symmetry
algebra. This shortness condition ﬁxes the kinematics.

When the magnons carry a lot of momentum on the spin chain, they become geomet-
rically large string solutions in the AdS dual. These are called giant magnons [6]. These
also carry central charge on the spin chain. The total central charge of a closed string state
vanishes because of the level-matching constraint. In the spin chain side this arises from
the cyclic property of the trace [7].
The central charge on the gauge theory spin chain can also be sourced by open bound-
ary conditions. These can be realized by supersymmetric D-branes in the AdS side, with
open strings attached to them. These D-brane states provide a very tractable connection
between the gauge theory dynamics and the AdS geometry. This connection to the cen-
tral charge extension on the spin chain and gravity dual side has been analyzed in the
works [8–14]. Particularly, it has been suggested in [11] that the central charge extension
on the spin chain side is very closely related to the central charge extension of the Coulomb
branch of N = 4 SYM. Our recent work [14] showed how this works on the sigma model
side for open string states suspended between D-brane states made of AdS giant gravitons.
A complete picture in the analysis of the spin chain side is still missing.
As a reminder, giant gravitons are D-brane states that preserve half the supersym-
metry of the N = 4 SYM theory. They can grow into the sphere [15], or into the AdS
directions [16, 17]. The ones that grow in the AdS directions are related to (classical)
spontaneous symmetry breaking from U(N) →U(N −1) × U(1) via the Higgs mechanism,
which generates expectation values for the scalars [17] (see also [18]). All of these D-brane
states can be understood in terms of the classiﬁcation of half-BPS states in N = 4 SYM
in terms of Young tableaux [19]. Sphere giant gravitons are represented by long single
columns [20], while AdS giant gravitons are long single rows.
Very importantly, the AdS giant gravitons explore the radial direction of the AdS5
geometry. This has always been the most mysterious emergent dimension in the AdS/CFT
correspondence. It has been related to a UV-IR relation [21], where the position in AdS
is related to the UV scale of physics on the boundary. The radial direction has also been
related to the Renormalization group ﬂow [22] and via the AdS D-branes, it is also related
to the Higgs mechanism.
The radial direction on the spin chain side is much less well understood. Some states
that explore the radial direction appear when rotating strings in AdS are studied [23],
see also [24, 25]. They are characterized by logarithmic contributions in the spin quan-
tum number to their anomalous dimension. An argument for their logarithmic scaling of
anomalous dimension is given in [26]. The open strings strecthing between AdS giants
that have been studied previously by us [14] do not have such logarithmic contributions to
their anomalous dimension. Instead, their anomalous dimensions are governed by super-
symmetry, and in particular, by the amount of central charge they carry. Their dispersion
relation is
∆−J =
s
Q2 +
λ
4π2 |Z|2,
(1.1)
where Q is the angular momentum on S3 ⊂AdS5 and Z is the central charge of the open
string, in geometric units. At very large angular momentum on the sphere (Q →∞), for the
– 2 –

JHEP01(2021)080
giant magnons suspended between D-branes, their anomalous dimension can be arbitrarily
close to zero, even at strong coupling. This follows because the square root can be expanded
in powers of Z/Q. This is a power series in the t’Hooft coupling λ, and therefore one can in
principle match coeﬃcients order by order in perturbation theory on the CFT side. Other
sets of works suggest that the giant magnon dispersion relation also plays a role in more
general geometries. In particular, it has been argued that the central charge extension
controls magnon dispersion relations in concentric LLM geometries [27, 28]. The LLM
geometries are solutions of type IIB supergravity on AdS5×S5 that preserve exactly half of
the supersymmetries [29]. They can be thought of as condensates of sphere giant gravitons
and/or AdS giant gravitons. In the ﬁeld theory dual, these condensates are expected to
describe the quantum corrected half-BPS Coulomb branch of the ﬁeld theory, where the
corrections are induced by the boundary sphere curvature. Because they describe part of
the Coulomb branch, one would expect that the central charge extension of the Coulomb
branch has a role to play in the dynamics.
The LLM geometries depend on a two coloring of a degeneration plane (the LLM
plane). If the coloring is made out of concentric circles, the background geometry has a
well deﬁned additional circular symmetry generated by a U(1) R-charge J. This is the
same J that appears in (1.1). For a general LLM background, only ∆−J is well deﬁned.
The backgrounds break the J, ∆symmetries independently, leaving ∆−J = 0 for the
background conﬁguration. The concentric geometries are eigenstates of J, ∆in the dual
ﬁeld theory.
The purpose of the current work is to address this idea on the sigma model side. In
particular, we want to understand exact solutions of the sigma model for open strings
stretching between sphere giant gravitons or AdS giant gravitons in general LLM geome-
tries. These are more complicated geometries than AdS5×S5. To get a simple ﬁnite answer,
there must be interesting cancellations taking place in the gravity calculation. One of our
goals to see how this analytic behavior arises in the string sigma model computation.
In particular, we will ﬁnd exact expansions in the t’Hooft coupling for ∆−J as above,
that can in principle be matched to perturbative computations in ﬁeld theory. It turns
out, that even though the sigma model in these geometries is not expected to be integrable
(for example, a naive Bethe ansatz is expected to have inelastic boundary conditions [30]),
it is under enough analytic control so that these BPS strings are analytically solvable and
the dispersion relations for the open strings will look identical to equation (1.1). We pay
extra attention to geometries that correspond to concentric circles, because they allow us
to explore the amount of charge J that the string carries. It will turn out that the quantity
J contains additional information that is not carried by either the angular momentum Q
or the central charge. It depends on more details of the precise position of the string in
the background geometry. Nevertheless, after some manipulations, we will show that it
also gives rise to an expansion in the t’Hooft coupling that can be matched between the
spin chain and the geometry, at least to leading order. These seem to be non-protected
quantities associated to the symmetries that are spontaneously broken by the D-brane
background for these states. These determine in the end if a putative string state belongs
to the Hilbert space or if it does not. If the J charge diverges, the string state is not allowed.

Such phenomena already arise in the spin chain computations [11], so it is important to
understand their behavior in the gravity dual setup as well.
Another interesting aspect of the open strings between sphere giant gravitons is that
there is a relation of the geometric sigma model solution and the Bethe ansatz on the
spin chain [10]. When one studies open strings attached to these giant gravitons, sites can
“jump in” and “jump out” of the spin chain [31]. To have a more standard description,
one realizes the spin chain in a bosonized language. One writes the states in terms of the
number of sites between defects on the spin chain, rather than in terms of spin up and
spin down state. Now, the number of sites in the spin chain is ﬁxed, and the boundary
conditions allow number non-conservation for the bosonic excitations instead. If one writes
coherent states for these generalized bosons, one ﬁnds that the equations that lead to the
ground state of the spin chain can be understood as a bound state condition on the S-
matrix of the magnons, subject to corresponding boundary conditions. Similar results are
not known in the dual SL(2) sector. An approximation for the SL(2) sector at very large
vevs of the central charge for strings stretching between a dual giant graviton and itself can
be found in [32], where the “jumping in” and “jumping out” of letters is self-consistently
ignored in the limit of large spin/central charge. A similar connection to the Bethe ansatz
is not known.
We provide evidence in this paper that the open strings stretching between dual giant
gravitons also have an interpretation in terms of zeros of an S-matrix for the SL(2) sector.
In particular, we get a better understanding of the analytic continuation of the SU(2)
spin chain to the SL(2) sector. We will also show that our interpretation of the analytic
continuation is compatible with the sigma model calculations.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we review the form of all half BPS
solutions to type IIB supergravity, and we re-express them in form that makes certain
cancellations clearer. In section 3 we provide an explicit example of the open string solutions
in question by considering the case of AdS5 × S5. In section 4 we solve for open strings
stretching between both sphere and AdS giants in a general half BPS geometry, ﬁnding
very similar expressions to those in the case of AdS5 × S5. In section 5 we concentrate
on concentric half-BPS geometries, for which we study the form of the R-charge J and its
relation to the metric of the half-BPS geometry. In the case of AdS5 ×S5, we study various
limits for which this expression simpliﬁes, and match the leading sigma model answer on
R × S3 to a computation on the dual one-loop SU(2) spin chain. We are able to interpret
the equations that lead to the sigma model solution as a continuum version of the condition
for having a pole of the magnon S-matrix for the SU(2) and SL(2) sectors. The answers on
both sectors are related to each other by an analytic continuation of the radial parameter
of the LLM plane.

the regularity of (2.1), we must have that the quantity H−2 =

4 −z2 remains ﬁnite as
y approaches zero. This means that z = ± 1
2 on the y = 0 plane which we will call the
LLM plane. Because of this, the metric is completely determined by a coloring of the LLM
plane into regions where z = ± 1

This is convenient since the parametrization (2.3) makes the metric explicitly regular at
y = 0 inside the colored regions. Generically, at the boundary of a droplet the one form V
becomes singular, but such singularities can be eliminated via coordinate transformations.
An explicit form of V is:
Vi(x1, x2, y) = ϵij

(2.4)
Here the integration is taken along the boundaries of the droplets. This guarantees that
Vi →0 as |x|, |y| →∞. Finally, the regions z = ± 1
2 are the degeneration loci of the either
one of the two three-spheres, which is clear from equation (2.3).

Open strings on AdS3 × S1
Now we wish to review the solutions of the Nambu-Goto sigma model corresponding to
rigidly rotating strings on a AdS3 × S1 subspace of AdS5 × S5 that appeared in [14], but
studying the solution directly in the LLM cordinates instead. The corresponding metric
in the coordinates (2.1) is described by a single droplet conﬁguration on the LLM plane of
radius r0:
z(r, y; r0) =

(3.1)
We will be interested in solutions that reside at the y = 0 locus, with a D3 brane wrapping
the non-vanishing three-sphere and with the string rotating along a circle of the non-
vanishing sphere. The eﬀective metric for the space on which the strings move can be

with s = sgn(r0 −r). The eﬀective geometry for r > r0 corresponds to AdS5 × S1, while
r < r0 corresponds to Rt × S5. One should also note that the behavior of Vφ at y = 0 is
non-trivial as r crosses r0:
Vφ(r < r0, y = 0) =

(3.4)
Where the variable r has been re-scaled to be unitless. Now we can consider the string
sigma model on this geometry, concentrating on rigid open string solutions that end on
two static dual giant gravitons. The boundary conditions allow for the endpoints of the
string to move freely along the ψ direction, so we restrict to conﬁgurations where the string
endpoints co-rotate at the same angular velocity β. A convenient ansatz for the embedding
coordinates is of the form:
t = τ
r = r(σ)
φ = φ(σ)
ψ = βτ + g(σ) .
(3.5)
Then, the string action in these coordinates is given by:
S = −

(r2 −1)2g′2 + 2β(r2 −1)φ′g′ + φ′2(β2(1 −r2) + r2) + (1 −β2)r′2) .
(3.6)
For the coordinate g one has to impose Neumann boundary conditions, which is equivalent
to saying that the worldsheet current density ∂L
∂g′ vanishes at the end points of the string.
In addition to this, since the action is independent of g this current must vanish identically
along the string. This leads to the condition:
g′ = −βφ′
r2 −1
(3.7)
which can be used to eliminate g in the action. This reduces the problem to a geodesic
equation on a ﬂat plane, as long as r ̸= 1 where equation (3.7) degenerates:

Due to the rotational symmetry of the droplet, a general solution can always be transformed
to one determined by a pair of angles φ1, φ2 from the x1 axis and the closest approach to
the origin a. These are the same solutions studied in [14] in slightly diﬀerent coordinates.
In particular, the conserved charge associated to time translations of the coordinates (3.4)
follows a relativistic dispersion relation

where Q is the angular momentum associated to rotations along ψ and Z is the central
charge associated to the separation of the branes. It is also important to notice that the
density of central charge and angular momentum per unit length are constant along the
string. One can also check that the angular momentum density J associated to rotations
along the LLM plane diverges if the string solution touches boundary of the droplet. We
will make this more explicit in section 5.

Open strings on LLM geometries
We can now discuss more general solutions corresponding to open strings on general 1
2-BPS
geometries. As we will see these share many similarities to the solutions discussed in the
previous section.
4.1
Strings outside a droplet
First we consider the case for a string inside a connected region with z = −1
2. Within each
of these regions we have a non-vanishing three-sphere on which we can wrap D3 branes.
In the end, we will be interested in rotating string solutions, so we will also single out a
circle within this three-sphere with coordinate ψ on which the string endpoints rotate. The
branes will sit at y = 0, but it is convenient to keep the value of y unﬁxed along the string
as this makes the various cancellations clear. The appropriate ansatz for the embedding
coordinates is the similar to the one before,
t = ωτ
xi = xi(σ)
y = y(σ)
ψ = βτ + g(σ)
(4.1)
except that the eﬀective metric is now of the general form:

(4.3)
Where we have set ω = 1 for simplicity. The coordinate g′ can be eliminated by a com-
bination of its equation of motion and boundary conditions as before. This leads to the
simple relation which generalizes (3.7):
g′ = βVix′
i .
(4.4)
Once again, the relation (4.4) shows that the variable g′ becomes ill-deﬁned whenever the
string touches the boundary of a droplet (2.4) at y = 0. One can also express this relation
in a way that is independent of the parametrization,
dg = βV
(4.5)
so that dg is well deﬁned in regions where z is locally constant. Substituting this relation
into the action (4.3) will cancel the terms in G which are multiplied by the warp factor H,
which simpliﬁes the action to the form:

to ω:

Z
dτdσ
s

(1 −β2( 1
2 −z))(x′2

(4.7)
In general, having the string extend in the y direction makes the equations non-linear, but
such conﬁgurations happen to not have minimal energies. The minimal energy conﬁgura-
tions are those for which y = 0 along the string, for which the action reduces to a geodesic
problem on the LLM plane.
S = −

(4.8)
This is the same result as for open strings between D-branes in AdS5×S5, so the kinematic
features are the same.
As a result, this class of solutions also admit a giant magnon
dispersion relation:
ϵ =

JHEP01(2021)080
Generically, an LLM geometry will not have rotational invariance along the LLM plane
due to the placement of sources for z. This means the charge J associated to this rotation
is no longer a good quantum number in the dual description. However, there is always an
approximate translational symmetry in the limit that one zooms into the boundary of a
droplet. The eﬀective geometry in this limit is always a plane-wave, and the density of the
momentum associated to the approximate translational symmetry will generically diverge.
This is because such quantities are always proportional to the gauge potential V which is
not well deﬁned at the interfaces between the diﬀerent values of z.
4.2
Inside a droplet
The analysis for connected regions with z = 1
2 is completely analogous to the one in the
previous section. In this case there is a diﬀerent non-vanishing three-sphere ˜
S3, from which
we single out a circle ˜θ. The eﬀective metric is a simple variation of (4.2)

.
(4.10)
The appropriate ansatz in this case is the same as before (3.5), but we replace the variable
ψ by:
˜θ = ˜βτ + h(σ) .
(4.11)
The computation of the action is entirely analogous as to the discussion in the previous
section. The analogous condition (4.4) that arises from the boundary conditions for h is:
h′ = ˜βVix′
i
(4.12)
which tells us that h′ is the pullback of V on the worldsheet inside the droplet regions.
This means that h′ has the same singularities along interfaces as g′ did, so that continuing
the variable g to regions inside a droplet becomes problematic. After eliminating h, the
action takes the same form as before with the appropriate change in kinematic factors:
S = −

Similarly, the energy can be easily shown to satisfy a similar relativistic dispersion relation

(4.14)
Where ˜Q is the angular momentum along the circle ˜θ.

On-shell charges
For this section we will concentrate on 1
2-BPS geometries that correspond to concentric
droplets and rings on the LLM plane.
This is useful since we will want to study the
behavior of the charge J associated to rotations around the origin of the LLM plane. One
important point that should be noted is that the coordinates (2.1) are implicitly rotating
– 9 –

JHEP01(2021)080
with respect to an observer that is far away from the sources to whom the geometry looks
like AdS5 × S5. So solutions that are static in these coordinates correspond to strings that
rotate along a cycle that asymptotically looks like the equator of S5. As such the charge
ϵ associated to time translation symmetry in the LLM coordinates actually corresponds
to ∆−J in the global AdS coordinates. One can ﬁnd the expression for J for a general
concentric geometry by modifying the ansatz for the coordinate φ (3.5) to include time
dependence,
φ = ϕ(σ) + γτ
(5.1)
and in the end substituting the on-shell value γ = 0. Unlike the charges ϵ, Z, Q( ˜Q) the
angular momentum J turns out to be sensitive to the details of the geometry. This is
because the general form of ϵ is ﬁxed by supersymmetry [5], and the other charges assemble
into a relativistic dispersion relation.
As discussed in [11], the shortening condition is
essential to get the right multiplicities for light open strings between nearby giants. This
is what guarantees that the local physics looks like N = 4 SYM on the Coulomb branch.
For concreteness we ﬁrst concentrate on the case where the strings live in a region outside
a single circular droplet on the LLM plane, and then we show that the analysis extends
to solutions sitting inside the droplet. The resulting expression for J and its density along
the string are:

From this we can see that the density J is proportional to Vφ, so that it becomes
inﬁnite at the boundaries of the droplets as claimed. Since the central charge density is

One can also express the density J in terms of the quantum numbers Q, Z, the t’Hooft cou-
pling λ and r. For completeness we will carry this out for the simplest droplet conﬁguration
studied in section 3, in the regime that the strings are far away from the droplet.
5.1
Strings near the boundary
We would like to evaluate (5.2) for a string solution that sits very far away from a single
droplet, while the size of the string remains ﬁnite but large. These correspond to strings
that sit near the boundary of AdS5. As it turns out, the expression (5.2) is not the same
as the angular momentum measured by an asymptotic observer in global AdS, since the
– 10 –

JHEP01(2021)080
coordinates (3.4) describe a rotating frame ˜φ = φ−t, so that the expression for J is actually
a linear combination of the scaling dimension ∆and the spin ˜J seen by a static observer
near the boundary. The two quantities J, ˜J are related by a simple change of coordinates,
but it is more convenient to work with the expressions in [14] which have a clearer physical
interpretation.
More concretely, this is the choice of coordinates for which the scaling
dimension ∆grows with the distance from the origin, while the spin ˜J becomes smaller:
˜J =

( dr
d˜φ)2 + β2 −1 + r2
(r2 −1)
q
(1 −β2)(r2 + ( dr
d˜φ)2)
.
(5.4)
Here ˜φ = φ−t corresponds to the coordinate for the equator of the S5. We should also note
that this expression for ˜J is not gauge invariant, as it will turn out that this expression
is related to the one form V that appears in the metric. On the one hand these gauge
transformations can be always absorbed into a redeﬁnition of the string coordinates g and
h (4.4). However, one should also keep in mind that gauge transformations that vanish
at inﬁnity do not change the asymptotics of ˜J, so that the coordinate choices for which
˜J vanishes at inﬁnity are well-deﬁned. In order to ﬁx the residual gauge symmetry one
has to choose coordinates that look asymptotically like static global AdS rather than the
rotating LLM coordinates. It will also be convenient to make the choice Vr = 0 in order to
keep the rotational symmetry explicit.
We wish to ﬁnd an expression for (5.4) in terms of the angular momentum Q, the string end
points ξ1, ξ2, and the t’Hooft coupling λ. For this, it is best to re-express the integral using
an aﬃne parametrization for the complex coordinate on the LLM plane z = ξ1(1−s)+ξ2s.
In order to eliminate the angular velocity β, we have to impose a double scaling limit based
on (3.9). The particular double scaling limit we will be interested in comes from ﬁxing the
angular momentum Q and the positions of the end points of the string:
Q
Z =
√
λ
2π
β
p
1 −β2 < ∞.
(5.5)
This is a physical choice of scaling, since the strings become tensionless in the relativitic
limit β →1.
This leaves us with two independent parameters to tune which we can
choose to be the ratio Q
Z and the t’Hooft coupling, since changing the value of β has to be
compensated by a change of λ in order to keep Q and Z ﬁxed. This means that the angular
velocity and the t’Hooft coupling can’t be changed independently from each other. The
full expression for ˜J in terms of these parameters can be expressed as a sum of two terms:
˜J =

(5.6)
This expression is interesting as it is a series expansion in λ around zero, while also showing
a scale separation given at small and large energies ϵ.
In particular, one can expect that this quantity can be recovered via a perturbative
calculation in the dual ﬁeld theory since we have a series expansion in the t’Hooft coupling.
– 11 –

JHEP01(2021)080
This is diﬀerent from in the other giant magnon solutions studied in the literature which
always have inﬁnite spin ˜J and correspond to closed strings [6, 33]. Alternatively, one
can expand in κ = λ/Q2, which can be done even at strong coupling. This is similar to
how in the plane wave limit the eﬀective perturbation parameter depends on the quantum
numbers of an excitation [7].
We will reproduce the leading term of the expansion in the su(2) sector by an explicit
computation from the one-loop spin chain Hamiltonian with boundary conditions. Moti-
vated by an analytic continuation of the Bethe ansatz, we will obtain an expression for the
sl(2) spin chain with open boundary conditions, even when we do not know the form of
the precise computation on the dual ﬁeld theory for this sector. In general, these boundary
conditions are expected to break integrability, but the existence of a Bethe-like ansatz for
the su(2) in terms of Cuntz oscillator coherent states suggests that a similar story exists
for the sl(2) spin chain. One should also note that even though the leading term is in-
dependent of λ, the computation requires knowing the one-loop mixing Hamiltonian for
the su(2) sector, and higher order corrections arise from higher loop contributions to the
mixing of operators.
5.1.1
Rapidly rotating strings
An interesting limit to consider is when the strings rotate with a large angular velocity
β →1 with ﬁxed angular momentum Q. This is the limit where the t’Hooft coupling
becomes small, so that the second term in (5.6) can be ignored.

In the limit that the string end points are very far away from the origin we can ignore the
1 in the denominator of (5.7):
˜J =
θ12|Q|
|ξ1||ξ2| sin θ12
+ . . .
(5.9)
Although the expression (5.9) is regular at θ12 = 0 where the string end points are colinear,
there is a divergence at θ12 = π coming from the fact that the string has to cross the droplet.
In the strict ξ →∞limit, the leading order contribution for ˜J vanishes. Generically, in
the strict β →1 limit the divergent contributions to the LLM angular momentum will
decouple so that the expressions for ˜J and J match. More explicitly, the expression (5.2)
becomes much simpler in this limit.

Where r(s) is an aﬃne parametrization for the string in the LLM plane. It also turns
out that the expression (5.10) is valid inside and outside the droplet regions as long as
one chooses the correct branch for Vφ(y = 0). Another thing to note is that value of Vφ
inside of the droplet is related to its value outside the droplet by a change of sign and a
transformation r →r2
0
r , where r0 is related to the AdS radius r2
AdS = r0. By restoring the
dependance on r0, the expression (5.9) should be understood as the leading order expansion
in r0/m2, where m2 is a large mass parameter compared to r0. This can be done by either
sending the string end points to inﬁnity, or by considering a small droplet. This is also the
regime where the contribution to masses of the conformally coupled scalars coming from
the curvature of R × S3 is negligible in the ﬁeld theory, which is a decompactiﬁcation limit
of the S3. This suggests that the leading non-vanishing term in J at large β should be
reproducible from a Coulomb branch computation, while the higher order terms in powers
r0 should come from taking into account correctly the mixing between the higgsinos and
gauginos, since a priori the massive vectors do not couple to the curvature RS3 ∼RAdS. A
calculation with background ﬁelds properly included would look similar to [34], where the
localization in the geometry is provided directly by the D-brane background ﬁelds, rather
than a saddle point.
For more general concentric droplet geometries the expression for Vφ outside the largest
droplet is given by a linear combination of droplets [29]:
Vφ(r, y = 0) =

(5.11)
The leading expression for ˜J in this case can be easily seen to come from adding the

(5.12)
This suggests that the leading order computation on the dual ﬁeld theory side also
comes from summing simple contributions and at leading order the droplets don’t aﬀect
each other.
5.2
Strings inside a droplet
We can also do the analogous computation for string solutions sitting inside a circular
droplet region. In this case the motion of the string is restricted to an S3 × R subspace of
AdS5 × S5. It is well known that the giant magnons on S3 × R have a dual description in
terms of a su(2) integrable spin chain whose Hamiltonian computes the mixing of operators.

5.2.1
Dual spin chain picture
The one loop Hamiltonian for the SU(2) sector with open boundary conditions is of the
form [11, 31]:
H1 = λ
k
X
i=0
(a†
i −a†
i+1)(ai −ai+1)
(5.13)
Here a0 and ak+1 are complex numbers describing the collective coordinates of the giant
gravitons, and the ai are Cuntz oscillators satisfying the algebra:
aia†
j = δij
a†
iai = 1 −|0⟩i⟨0|i
(5.14)
The integer k + 1 is associated to the angular momentum ˜Q which counts the number of
sites of the oscillator chain, which has a length corresponding to the central charge Z. In
the gauge theory variables k counts the number of Y insertions between Z in the operator:
O ∼. . . ZZZY L1Z . . . ZY Ln . . .
X
i
Li = k + 1
(5.15)
A complete combinatoric picture of how the strings are attached to the giants and how
the boundary conditions emerge is found in the works [35–38]. To ﬁx the angular position
of the brane one needs to add a coherent state description of the D-branes [8]. These
discussions usually only pertain to the SU(2) sector. For he SL(2) sector, an incomplete
description in the Cuntz oscillator language is found in [32], which was derived from [39].
This description of the SL(2) sector is not that of a spin chain with local nearest neigh-
bor terms only. This makes a direct analysis very cumbersome. When we discuss such
calculations, we will sidestep this direct route of computation by utilizing ideas from the
Bethe ansatz.
We then proceed by considering an unnormalized coherent state for each oscillator:
|zi⟩=
∞
X
n=0
zn
i |n⟩
(5.16)
Substituting this into the Hamiltonian and minizing the energy one obtains the condition
zi −zi+1 = δZ for every adjacent pair of sites, where δZ is a constant which acts as a
lattice spacing for the string. The quantity δZ is generically complex, but we can always
align the coordinates so that it is real.
This means that the central charge density along the chain Z
˜Q is a ﬁxed constant. It
can also be checked that this is in fact an eigenstate of the one-loop Hamiltonian with
minimal energy.
One can easily check that,
⟨¯z|z∂z|z⟩=
∞
X
n=0
nzn|n⟩=
z¯z
(1 −z¯z)2
⟨¯z|z⟩=
1
1 −z¯z .
(5.17)
– 14 –

JHEP01(2021)080
So that the average occupation number for each site is given by:
⟨¯z|z∂z|z⟩
⟨¯z|z⟩
=
z¯z
1 −z¯z
(5.18)
This occupation number also computes the R-charge J for each oscillator, so that in total
we have:
J =
k
X
i=1
zi¯zi
1 −zi¯zi
.
(5.19)
Since the central charge density along the string is constant, we can multiply each term by
the central charge density |δZ| = |zi −zi−1| = Z
k
J = | ˜Q −1|
Z

δZ −→δZ→0 | ˜Q|

(5.20)
The sum can then be approximated by an integral as we take the eﬀective lattice spacing
δZ to zero, by which one expects to recover the continuum string description.
5.2.2
Sigma model computation
The computation of the spin J for the sigma model is straightforward. In this case we
should take the metric with r < 1 where the string motion occurs on S3 × R as opposed
to AdS3 × S1. As before we will be interested in the double scaling limit that arises from
taking ˜β →1 while holding the angular momentum ˜Q and central charge constant. The
charge ˜Q and angular frequency ˜β should not be confused with Q and β although their
roles are very similar. The leading order expression is simply:
J = | ˜Q|
Z 1
0
dsVφ (r(s), y = 0) .
(5.21)
Again, we can introduce an aﬃne parametrization for the complex variable on the LLM
plane z = η1(1 −s) + η2s and re-express (3.3) in complex coordinates r2 = z¯z:
J = | ˜Q|
Z 1
0
ds
z¯z
1 −z¯z .
(5.22)
Which matches the spin chain computation precisely. We can evaluate the integral explic-
itly by noting that there is a simple relation between the angular momentum density inside
and outside the droplet,
z¯z
1 −z¯z =
1
1 −z¯z −1 .
(5.23)
Which reduces to the same integral (5.8) as before:

5.3
Magnon S-matrix and Bethe Ansatz
An interesting property of the coherent state ansatz for the one-loop Hamiltonian is that
it leads to solutions to the Bethe equations. To see this more explicitly, substituting the
coherent state ansatz into the Hamiltonian and minimizing over the complex parameters
zi one ﬁnds that their second diﬀerence vanishes:
zi+1 −2zi + zi−1 = 0 .
(5.25)
We can always choose to parametrize the complex variables zi = eρi, which leads to the
relation:
eρi+1−ρi−1 −2eρi−ρi−1 + 1 = 0 .
(5.26)
To make the connection to the Bethe ansatz more explicit it is convenient to make a change
of variables:
ipl+1 + ipl = ρl+1 −ρl−1
ipl = ρl −ρl−1 .
(5.27)
Solving these relations leads to an expression purely in terms of p1,2,
eip2+ip1 −2eip1 + 1 = 0
(5.28)
which can be recognized as a pole for the 2-magnon S-matrix for the SU(2) sector:
Ssu(2)
12
= −eip2+ip1 −2eip2 + 1
eip2+ip1 −2eip1 + 1 = u1 −u2 −i
u1 −u2 + i
eipl = ul −i/2
ul + i/2 .
(5.29)
The interpretation of this pole is that we have formed a bound state of the magnons. Such
magnon bound states have the same dispersion relation of (3.9), as they are also in short
representations of the centrally extended spin chain [40]. In this sense, the Bethe ansatz
computation and the sigma model are fully consistent with each other.
5.3.1
Analytic continuation to SL(2)
Another important fact is that the 2-magnon S-matrix for the SL(2) sector is related up
to a phase factor to the inverse of the SU(2) S-matrix (we follow [41]):
Ssl(2)
12
∝−eip2+ip1 −2eip1 + 1
eip2+ip1 −2eip2 + 1 = u1 −u2 + i
u1 −u2 −i
eipl = ul + i/2
ul −i/2 .
(5.30)
In the formula above, the right hand side of the S-matrix looks the same, but the identi-
ﬁcation of momentum with the u variable diﬀers, and is clearly the inverse of the one of
SU(2) above.
In particular, the role of poles and zeros is exchanged with respect to the SU(2) sector.
Naively one would expect that the Cuntz oscillator representation of the SU(2) Hamiltonian
– 16 –

JHEP01(2021)080
can be analytically continued by allowing the complex parameters zi to lie outside the unit
disk, but this is not the case because then the ground state is no longer normalizable and
the S-matrix would not have the correct pole structure. In particular the relation (5.25)
would lead to a zero of the 2 magnon S-matrix rather than a pole. If instead one exchanges
zi ↔
1
zi = ˜zi, one ﬁnds that the zeros of (5.29) are exchanged with poles, while having
|˜zi| > 1. Substituting this directly in (5.19) leads to the expression:
J =
k
X
i=1
1
zi¯zi −1
(5.31)
where k now counts the number of derivatives between the Z operators as opposed to
counting the number of Y insertions between Z’s. When we take the continuum limit
of this expression one obtains the same integral that appears in the string sigma model
computation for AdS3 × S1.
This analytic continuation also appears naturally in the LLM coordinates as the trans-
formation that maps the inside and outside of a droplet to each other. It now also appears
as a consistency condition for the analytically continued S-matrix. The fact that the string
solutions are straight lines on the LLM plane would translate to having a pole on the
magnon S-matrix for the SL(2) sector.

Discussion
In this work we studied a class of open string solutions ending on (dual) giant gravitons
in 1
2-BPS geometries of type IIB string theory. We showed that important simpliﬁcations
happen when one takes into consideration the appropriate boundary conditions for the end
points of the string. The solutions found have a relativistic dispersion relation so that
they generalize the giant magnon solutions to open strings in more general backgrounds.
This dispersion relation is related to a shortening condition of the central charge extension
symmetry on the worldsheet. In the solutions we studied, the strings are allowed to extend
into the non-compact dimensions of the spacetime, and they have well-deﬁned ﬁnite charges
inside droplet regions in the LLM plane.
We also found that the solutions cannot be
extended between regions of diﬀerent colors in the LLM plane without having divergences
in the approximate charges that generate translations parallel to the droplets, or in the
case of concentric geometries the angular momentum J associated to rotations in the LLM
plane. Additionally, the coordinates of the string along the non-vanishing three-sphere ﬁber
directions are related to the pull-back of a one form V of the geometry, so that the string
charge density on the ﬁber (and the analytic solution itself) diverges at the boundaries of
the droplets. As a consequence, one can expect that the operators corresponding to such
crossing string solutions do not exist within the class considered. These divergences are
also suggestive of possible instabilities for the states corresponding to the solutions where
the strings grace a droplet, like when one crosses a wall of marginal stability ( see also [11]).
Less supersymmetric solutions are allowed if the strings leave the LLM plane.
Finally, although one can explictly match the sigma model answer for J to a simple
computation in the SU(2) sector of the dual spin chain description, the analogous com-
– 17 –

JHEP01(2021)080
putation for the SL(2) has not been carried out and seems quite diﬃcult. The fact that
the sigma model predicts that the central charge is a constant per unit worldsheet angular
momentum (charge) appears in the dual SU(2) spin chain description as a condition on the
coherent state ansatz for the excited states. These conditions on the parameters zl = eρl
can be related to a Bethe ansatz solution to the Heisenberg spin chain, where the ratios
zl/zl+1 behave like Bethe roots.
It is natural for us to expect that a similar condition should arise in the SL(2) sector, as
the sigma model descriptions of both sectors are analytic continuations of each other. This
Bethe ansatz analysis was carried out by us in this paper and gives rise to a consistency
check with the sigma model computation. The analysis is interesting in that the variables
that would naturally play the role of zi, which are required to satisfy |zi| < 1 on the sphere
need to be transformed to zi →1/zi so that now they are lying outside the LLM plane.
This is exactly what is required to exchange the poles and zeros in the S-matrix, which is
a natural relation between the SL(2) and SL(2) Bethe ansatz S-matrices.
Similar bubbling solutions exist for six dimensional supergravity [42, 43] but the details
of the geometries are more complicated. Our results seem to apply to an isolated class of
these geometries, at least when the torus ﬁbration of the geometries is a product of circles.
The analysis for general 6d 1
2 BPS bubbling geometries is complicated by the appearance
of an axion corresponding to the oﬀ-diagonal component of the metric for the torus ﬁber,
which introduces additional singularities where non-trivial sectional circles of the torus
vanish. Similarly, when we try to work with 1
4 and 1
8 BPS geometries in ten dimensions,
the ﬂat LLM plane is replaced by a four or six dimensional Kähler base with three or
ﬁve dimensional droplets [44], and constructing explicit metrics is a very non-trivial task.
In all these situations the backgrounds preserve only 8 or 4 supersymmetries rather than
16 and this seems to be the main reason the analysis is more complicated. Even open
strings suspended between AdS giants in AdS5 × S5 that together only preserve 1
4 of the
supersymmetries seem to have additional corrections. We are currently investigating these
issues. These might be more tractable in the limit that the AdS giant gravitons carry very
large charge, as in this limit the analysis also simpliﬁed for the 1
2 BPS case.
