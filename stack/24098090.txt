 Is the Hubble flow a result of inverse cascade?*
 V. Krishan
 Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore 560 034, India
 A few general characteristics of nonlinear open systems
 are described. A turbulent fluid is one such system
 which exhibits order by supporting structures in an
 otherwise random medium through the transfer of
 energy from small spatial scales to large spatial scales.
 The spatial distribution of energy so derived is found
 to account well for two disparate situations like the
 solar granulation and the rotation curves of galaxies.
 Encouraged by these successes, one wonders if the
 spatial distribution of energy at the largest scales, i.e.
 V(L) « L has anything to do with the Hubble flow.
 Coherent structures, correlated motions and well-defined
 patterns are observed on a variety of spatial as well as
 temporal scales. Organized states of matter and motion
 can be seen in a convection cell, cloud complexes, a
 tornado, a cyclone, zonal flows on planetary surfaces,
 the Red Spot of Jupiter, convective flows on stellar
 surfaces, spiral patterns in galaxies, clusters of galaxies
 and perhaps ourselves. Figure 1 a-c represents distribu
 tion of clouds in the earth's atmosphere, of convective

 motions on the solar surface and of galaxies in clusters
 of galaxies. Could you tell one from the other? Figure
 2 a, b represents the velocity vectors in a cluster of
 galaxies and on the solar photosphere. Both show con
 verging and diverging flows. The usual interpretation
 for clusters of galaxies is infall of matter in the strong
 gravitational field of the unseen dark matter, whereas
 the solar photosphere acquires the same pattern due to
 the formation of fluid vortices. Can the vortices account
 for the flow patterns in clusters of galaxies? Is the
 invisible matter indispensable? In other words, do these
 organized states of matter and motion arise under equi
 librium or non-equilibrium conditions? Is it substance
 and or style? Are these dissipative structures?
 Our proposal1-6 is that apparently disparate phenomena
 of (i) non-equilibrium motions on stellar surfaces, (ii)
 the large scale organization of matter, motion and mag
 netic field or in general the large scale structure of the
 universe have their origin in the inverse cascade of
 energy leading to self-organization in an otherwise non
 linear turbulent medium.

 to its initial state and is said to be stable. Under far-from chemical clocks. A bifurcation is associated with the
 equilibrium conditions, a system, when driven sufficiently breaking of a symmetry. One starts with a system
 far, may never return to its initial state and is said to describable by completely symmetric equations and finds
 be unstable. The system undergoes a bifurcation, where their solutions which are not symmetric, i.e. a bifurcation
 the initial solution becomes unstable and the new state splits into a so-called right handed and a left handed
 behaves in a manner completely different from that of solution. The physical reality may be embedded in only
 the initial state. The new state that emerges after a one of these solutions. For example, sea shells usually
 bifurcation is known as a dissipative structure. A spec- have a preferential chirality. It is seen that in a highly
 tacular example of this phenomenon is provided by unstable dynamical system, the trajectories starting from
 infinitesimally close points diverge exponentially in time
 a
 and such a system is said to be in a chaotic state. Th
 a completely deterministic description supports a chaoti
 solution, which lends it a probabilistic behaviour, i.
 the system is intrinsically random and irreversible. F
 example, a collection of particles moving parallel
 each other, develops randomness with the passage o
 time, i.e. they try to reach equilibrium. Now time
 inversion symmetry requires that the reverse must happen,
 i.e. randomly directed velocity vectors must align them
 selves with the passage of time. But this is never
 observed (Figure 3). This means that we need repre
 sentations of dynamics which are not invariant with
 respect to time inversion and such representations do
 exist for highly unstable systems. This reduces the
 predictability of a system. Tomorrow is not already
 present in today! Instead, it emerges in an unpredictable
 way, the way improvization is achieved in Indian music.

 It is in intrinsically random, irreversible, unsymmetric,
 non-equilibrium systems that all phenomena of material
 existence are embedded. The conditions for formation
 of dissipative structures can therefore be summarized
 as7'8: (i) a macroscopic system far from equilibrium, so
 that it can develop correlations among its different parts,
 (ii) the system is open towards its environment, i.e. it
 can draw from its surroundings, and (iii) it should be
 able to self-reinforce itself autocatalytically by a sustained
 level of fluctuations deriving from its neighbourhood.
 Fluid turbulence
 Far from equilibrium conditions exist everywhere in the
 universe, including its origin, the big bang. Many struc
 tures like galaxies and clusters of galaxies are suggested
 to form and exist in non-equilibrium states. The belief
 in equilibrium has led us to darkness, since, equilibrium
 commands that most of the matter in the universe remain
 invisible. To investigate the role of non-equilibrium
 nonlinear processes in astrophysical objects, we need to
 go to the fluid description since several aspects of
 stellar, galactic and the universe as a whole can be
 understood by treating them as fluids, always in a state
 of turbulence. The fluid turbulence is a tricky subject.
 Even Heisenberg found the problem too difficult. He is
 reputed to have said that he hoped, before he dies,
 some one would explain quantum mechanics to him,
 but after he died, he hoped, God would explain turbulence
 to him9. Nevertheless, a few characteristics of fluid
 turbulence can be summarized here. It is a random state
 of fluid motion that supports several interacting length
 and time scales through the excitation of instabilities.
 The scales are constrained by boundaries, buoyancy and
 dissipation. Turbulence affects all transport and diffusion

 processes, generally leading to an enhanced efficiency.
 Quantification of turbulence
 Mean values of the products of field variables (like
 velocity U, magnetic field, etc.) and their derivatives
 form the fabric of a turbulent medium. Out of these,

 and demonstrated that energy cascades from small spatial
 scales to large spatial scales according to K~s/3 law,
 thus setting up an inverse cascade1".
 Inverse cascade in 3D turbulence
 The appearance of large scale structures in the 3D
 atmospheres of planets compels us to look for the
 possibility of inverse cascade in 3D systems. Specifically,
 the observations of helical type of flow structures in
 circumstances varying from oceans to cloud complexes,
 brought to the fore, the importance of helicity in turbulent
 fluids. The fundamental idea that needed to be appreciated
 was that the large helicity fluctuations always exist in
 a turbulent medium, even if the average helicity vanishes.
 It was shown that the fluctuating topology of the vorticity
 field in turbulent flows can be characterized by the
 statistical helicity invariant I represented by conserved
 mean square helicity11"13:
 / = J<A(X)A(X + i)></V, (7)
 where
 h = V-VxU.
 Thus E and / are the two invariants of a helically
 turbulent 3D system. Again using Kolmogorovic argu
 ments for the I invariant, one finds the spectrum in the
 inertial range as
 E(K) a AT1
 and the total energy density
 W= jE{K) dK oc log [L(t)/l]. (8)
 Here L(r) is the transient length scale excited at time
 t. One observes that the energy grows very slowly as
 the spatial scale L(t) grows. So, practically, there is
 little transfer of energy towards large scales. But, what
 happens is that as the correlation length of helicity
 fluctuations increases, the velocity and vorticity become
 more and more aligned and as a consequence the non
 linear term (V-V)V of the Navier-Stokes equation de
 creases and flow of energy towards small scales is
 retarded. On the other hand, the growth of correlation
 length cannot go on indefinitely. Especially if the medium
 is restricted in the vertical direction by gravity or
 buoyancy as is true of atmospheres of any celestial
 object, may it be a planet or a star. Under such
 circumstances, the correlation length continues to grow
 in the horizontal plane and the system becomes more
 and more anisotropic. In addition, I{K) is found to be
 544
 dominant at small K while E(K) is larger at large K
 and the inverse cascade of I follows.
 What is achieved by the growth of correlation leng
 of helicity fluctuations is the anisotropy in the syst
 which can now be approximated to a quasi 2D system
 Here, the horizontal scale is much larger than the vertic
 scale and the vertical velocity is smaller than the ho
 zontal velocity. Under these conditions, the energy a
 the I spectrum become identical and go as K~5/}, as
 the 2D case. One expects that an increasing fraction 
 energy is transferred to large spatial scales as the
 anisotropy in the system increases. This can go on until
 coriolis force begins to be effective. The length scale
 Lc where the nonlinear term of the Navier-Stokes equa
 tion becomes comparable to the coriolis force is given
 by L. = U/Q., where Q. is the angular velocity. At these
 large scales, the system simulates 2D behaviour and
 enstrophy conservation begins to play its role. One may
 consider scales L>Lc as a source of vorticity injection
 into the system. The enstrophy then cascades towards
 small scales with a power law spectrum given by:

 The Hubble flow
 The energy spectrum at the largest spatial scales is
 governed by enstrophy transfer and goes as
 E(K)ocK~3. (11)
 Putting in the proportionality constants, the 
 density per unit gram varies as
 W(L) = V \L) = (e/L*)273 L2
 or
 V(L)*(e/Ll)l/3L. (12)
 g = V 2/t is the energy injection rate and {e/Lfy is the
 enstrophy injection rate. Substituting for Lc, the scale
 at which the coriolis force becomes comparable to
 nonlinear inertial force, one finds
 V(L) at (Q2/t)u3L (13)
 which, when compared with the Hubble flow expressed as
 V=HL
 gives the value of the Hubble constant H to be
 H = (Q2/f)w3. (14)
 546
 Does this mean that the velocities with which the
 galaxies are receding from each other like dots on an
 expanding balloon are given by the largest spatial scale
 end of the same energy spectrum whose small spatial
 scale part accounts so very well for the flat rotation
 curves? If one assumes that the angular speed at scales
 ~ L. is such that £2'1 =r, then one gets //"'= age of
 the universe = r, the duration for the injection of energy.
 If stars are the main contributors to turbulence, the age
 of the universe r is nothing but the age of the oldest
 stars. Of course, the big bang itself is a source of
 turbulence in the universe.
 Conclusion
 The need of the hour is to think non-equilibrium. Thi
 may alleviate some of the caveats that arise from th
 belief that equilibrium rules the universe. Hydrodynamics
 in addition to gravitational processes must be included
 in the scheme of things since a self-consistent distribution
 of matter and motion must be determined. One must
 realize that converging flows commonly occur in a
 turbulent fluid without the necessity of invoking great
 masses. The whole question of mass distribution or the
 large scale structure of the universe can only be settled
 by including the physics of hydrodynamical processes
 in the making of structures. The angular momentum
 must be treated with reverence!
