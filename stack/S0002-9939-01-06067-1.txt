COMPLETING THE CONFORMAL BOUNDARY
OF A SIMPLY CONNECTED LORENTZ SURFACE
ROBERT W. SMYTH
(Communicated by Wolfgang Ziller)
Abstract. This paper extends Kulkarni’s conformal boundary ∂L for a sim-
ply connected Lorentz surface L to a compact conformal boundary ∂cL. The
procedure used is analogous to Carath´eodory’s construction (in the deﬁnite
metric setting) of prime ends from the accessible points of a bounded simply
connected planar domain. The space ∂cL of conformal boundary elements is
homeomorphic to the circle, and contains Kulkarni’s conformal boundary ∂L
as a dense subspace.
1. Introduction
A Lorentz surface L = (S, [h]) is an oriented, connected C∞2-manifold S to-
gether with a conformal class of indeﬁnite metrics on S. Such a conformal class
of indeﬁnite metrics determines a naturally ordered pair of smooth null direction
ﬁelds X and Y on S, with X and Y distinct at each point of S. Local coordinates
x, y on S are called proper null coordinates (with respect to [h]) if
∂
∂x lies along X,
∂
∂y lies along Y and h = 2Bdxdy for some positive function B. The inextendible
integral curves of X are referred to as X-lines and the inextendible integral curves
of Y are called Y-lines. These two families of null lines capture the structure of L.
Although this structure is locally trivial, it has some interesting global properties.
(See [12] or [5] for a much more thorough presentation.) For later reference, we
note here that the span of a null line γ is the set of all points on null lines which
cross γ. The joint span of two null lines of opposite type (which meet each other)
is the intersection of their spans.
There are stark contrasts between the consequences of conformality in the def-
inite and indeﬁnite metric cases. For example, the celebrated Koebe uniformiza-
tion theorem shows that there are exactly 3 conformally distinct simply connected
Riemann surfaces, but there exist uncountably many conformally distinct simply
connected Lorentz surfaces. (See [9] or [10].) While C1 conformal maps (and even
1-quasiconformal maps) between Riemann surfaces must be smooth, there exist Cj
conformal equivalences between Lorentz surfaces which are not Cj+1 conformally

equivalent for j = 0, 1, . . .. (See [8].) Nevertheless, this paper develops a construc-
tion of conformal boundary elements for any simply connected Lorentz surface in a
way which is closely analogous to Carath´eodory’s construction of prime ends. Sev-
eral references are made in this paper to [7] in order to highlight the analogy. (All
page number references to [7] refer to volume 3.) Alternatively, one may consult
the treatment of Carath´eodory’s construction in [1] or [2].
2. Topological Lorentz surfaces
The natural correspondence between Lorentz surfaces and box surfaces can be
readily adapted to provide a deﬁnition of a topological Lorentz surface. The detailed
presentation from [12] of this correspondence is summarized below. Charts χ : U →
R2 and ˆχ : ˆU →R2 from the diﬀerentiable atlas A on S are C□-related if ˆχ ◦χ−1
may be expressed in some neighborhood of any point in χ(U ∩ˆU) by functions
ˆx = f(x) and ˆy = g(y) with f ′g′ > 0. A box surface is an ordered pair (S, A□)
where A□is a subatlas of A such that all charts of A□are C□-related and A□
is maximal with respect to this condition. Given a box surface (S, A□) one can
construct an indeﬁnite metric h on S such that the charts in A□yield proper null
coordinates on S with respect to [h]. Conversely, given a Lorentz surface L = (S, [h])
the collection of all charts that yield proper null coordinates forms a maximal C□-
atlas on S. The most trivial example of a Lorentz surface is the Minkowski plane
E2,1 = (R2, [dxdy]). The X-lines of the Minkowski plane are the horizontal lines
and the Y-lines are the vertical lines. Among the box charts of the corresponding
box surface are the maps obtained by restricting the identity on the plane to each
open subset.
The deﬁnitions above may be adapted to the context of topological 2-manifolds
merely by replacing the condition f ′g′ > 0 by the condition f and g both strictly
increasing or both strictly decreasing. The concept of a topological box surface
which results may be used as the deﬁnition for a topological Lorentz surface. Let
L = (S, A□) be a topological Lorentz surface. The box surface characterizations in
the diﬀerentiable setting of important Lorentz surface theory objects are here used
as deﬁnitions. Coordinates on S are proper null if they come from a chart in A□.
A locally one-to-one curve γ : I →S is called null if for any c ∈I and any χ ∈A□
whose domain contains γ(c), there exist a, b ∈I such that a < c < b and the image
of χ◦γ|(a,b) is a horizontal or vertical segment. An inextendible null curve which ﬁts
the horizontal (resp. vertical) case above at each point of its domain is called an X-
line (resp. Y-line). (Here a curve which may be extended after reparameterization is
considered extendible.) Two null lines which are reparameterizations of each other
are sometimes treated as the same null line. A conformal homeomorphism from
the topological Lorentz surface L1 = (S1, A□
1 ) to the topological Lorentz surface
L2 = (S2, A□
2 ) is a homeomorphism from S1 to S2 which takes X-lines to X-lines
and Y-lines to Y-lines.
Many of the basic results about Lorentz surfaces can be shown to hold also for
topological Lorentz surfaces with trivial modiﬁcations to statements and proofs.
(E.g.
Lemmas 3, 4 in [12].)
Other basic results (e.g.
Lemmas 11-15 in [12])
follow readily from the invariance of indices computed using Hamburger polygons
constructed with null arcs. (See [3].) Of course any Lorentz surface L determines
a topological Lorentz surface whose null lines are the same as those of L together
with all C0 reparameterizations thereof.

3. Kulkarni’s conformal boundary
The following treatment of Kulkarni’s conformal boundary diﬀers in ﬂavor some-
what from Kulkarni’s original presentation in [5], but is nevertheless easily seen to
amount to much the same thing.
Suppose L = (S, A□) is a simply connected topological Lorentz surface. Given
a null line γ : (a, b) →S and c ∈(a, b), the restrictions γ|(a,c] and γ|[c,b) are called
end rays. If the traces tr(α) and tr(β) of the end rays α and β have noncompact
intersection, then α and β are said to have the same ideal endpoint.
(Lemma
15 of [12] implies that two end rays that have the same ideal endpoint lie along
the same null line.) End rays α and β are called adjacent if there exists a chart
(U, χ) ∈A□with tr(α), tr(β) ⊂U such that χ(tr(α)) and χ(tr(β)) are adjacent
sides without the common vertex of some rectangle.
Let ∼be the equivalence
relation on the collection of all end rays of L generated by the relations of adjacency
and having the same ideal endpoint. The conformal boundary ∂L of L is the set of
all equivalence classes of ∼. Clearly conformal maps respect ∼so that a conformal
map f : L →ˆL between simply connected Lorentz surfaces induces a well-deﬁned
map ∂f : ∂L →∂ˆL given by ∂f([α]) = [f(α)] where α is any end ray in L.
(The relation ∼used here to form conformal boundary points as classes of
end rays may be viewed as an indeﬁnite metric analog of the relation used by
Carath´eodory to form accessible boundary points of a bounded simply connected
planar domain as classes of Jordan half-intervals. See the deﬁnition on p. 52 and
Theorem 2.9 of [7]. Note, however, that a conformal map between bounded sim-
ply connected subspaces of E2 = (R2, [dx2 + dy2]) need not take accessible points
to accessible points.) The rank of a conformal boundary point P is equal to the
largest possible number of representatives of P no two of which have the same ideal
endpoint.
Consider for example the topological Lorentz surface L∞= (R2, A□
∞) where the
charts in A□
∞include the complex exponential map restricted to each open subset
of R2 on which it is one-to-one. For each c ∈R and k ∈Z the horizontal ray
γc,k : (−∞, c] →R2 given by γc,k(t) = (t, πk
2 ) is an end ray in L∞. The end
ray γc,k lies along an X-line if k is even and along a Y-line if k is odd. End rays
γc,k and γd,l have the same ideal endpoint if and only if k = l. The end rays γc,k
and γd,k+1 are adjacent. (Consider their images under exp restricted to the strip
π
2 k −π
2 < y < π
2 (k + 1) + π
2 .) It follows that all of the end rays γc,k with c ∈R and
k ∈Z are among the representatives of a single (inﬁnite rank) conformal boundary
point (which we will call P∞).
4. Cyclic order on ∂L
Given P, Q ∈∂L, a trail from P to Q is a simple curve formed by concatenating
an end ray representing P with a piecewise null arc followed by an end ray repre-
senting Q. If Γ is a trail from P to Q (with P ̸= Q), S\tr(Γ) has two components,
RΓ (the one to the right of Γ) and LΓ. Deﬁne the ∂L-interval (P, Q) as the set of all
conformal boundary points other than P and Q which have end ray representatives
contained entirely in RΓ. It is intuitively clear that the set so obtained does not
depend on the choice of trail Γ, but only on the initial and ﬁnal points P and Q.
A proof appears in [11]. That there exists a trail connecting any given pair of dis-
tinct points of ∂L follows from Lemma 15 in [12] and the fact that any two points
of L may be joined by a piecewise-null arc. Lemma 1 lists the most fundamental

844
ROBERT W. SMYTH
properties of ∂L-intervals. The reader is encouraged to make a comparison with
the H-intervals of the deﬁnite metric case as deﬁned on pp. 58-60 in [7].
Lemma 1. Given P, Q, R, S ∈∂L with P ̸= Q,
(a)
(P, Q) ̸= ∅,
(b)
(P, Q) ∩(Q, P) = ∅,
(c)
(P, Q) ∪(Q, P) = ∂L\{P, Q},
(d)
if R ∈(P, Q), then Q ∈(R, P), and
(e)
if R ∈(P, Q) and Q ∈(P, S), then R ∈(P, S).
To see that (P, Q) is not empty, choose a trail Γ = γ1 + · · · + γn from P to Q,
where γ1, γn are end rays and γ2, . . . , γn−1 are null arcs. Without loss of generality,
it may be assumed that Γ is minimal in the sense that n is as small as possible. If
Γ makes a turn to the left at some vertex V , then the end rays emanating from V
which immediately enter RΓ are forced, by the minimality of Γ, not only to remain
in RΓ but also to represent conformal boundary points distinct from P and Q.
Suppose Γ does not make any turns to the left. For each point S on γi which is not
a vertex of Γ, consider the end ray α emanating from S which immediately enters
RΓ. Since Γ is minimal, either α represents a point of (P, Q), or i ≥3 and α meets
γi−2, or i ≤n −2 and α meets γi+2. The supposition that the ﬁrst case never
holds leads to a contradiction. The contradiction is relatively easy to obtain after
observing that n must (under the supposition) be at least 4, and the joint span of
the null lines on which γ2 and γ3 sit may be conformally embedded in a bounded
subspace of E2,1. (See Lemma 23 in [12].) Part (c) follows from Lemma 15 in [12].
Parts (b), (d) and (e) are intuitively compelling. The proofs are repetitive and are
therefore omitted.
Let [P, Q] = (P, Q) ∪{P, Q}. The results in Lemma 1 imply
Lemma 2. Given P, Q, R, S ∈∂L, with P ̸= Q and R ̸= S,
(a)
if R ∈(P, Q) and S /∈[P, Q], then Q ∈(R, S),
(b)
if R, S ∈[P, Q], then [R, S] ⊂[P, Q] or [S, R] ⊂[P, Q],
(c)
if R ∈[P, Q] and S /∈[P, Q], then Q ∈[R, S] and P ∈[S, R],
(d)
if [R, S] ̸⊂[P, Q] and P, Q /∈[R, S], then [P, Q] ∩[R, S] = ∅, and
(e)
if [R, S] ⊂[P, Q], then R ∈[P, S] and S ∈[R, Q].
The key behind teasing Lemma 2 out of Lemma 1 is the following perspective.
For each conformal boundary point P deﬁne the relation <P on ∂L\{P} by R <P Q
if R ∈(P, Q). For each P ∈∂L the relation <P is a linear order on ∂L\{P}.
Furthermore if P, Q, R and S are distinct elements of ∂L, then R <Q S if and only
if Q <P R <P S, R <P S <P Q or S <P Q <P R.
The topology on ¯L = L ∪∂L in [12] is equivalent to the one obtained by taking
B = {RΓ ∪(P, Q) : Γ is a trail from P to Q} as a subbase. Let C be a countable
dense subset of the surface S. The set D of conformal boundary points represented
by end rays that lie along null lines which intersect C is also countable. The proof
above which shows that (P, Q) is nonempty for distinct P, Q ∈∂L may be readily
adapted to show that (P, Q) contains some element of D. It follows that ∂L (with
the subspace topology inherited from ¯L) is separable. Henceforth ∂L is presumed
to be endowed with this subspace topology.

5. Completing the boundary
For many simply connected Lorentz surfaces the conformal boundary seems to
be topologically pathological. In [5], Kulkarni introduces the phrase wild at inﬁnity
to describe any Lorentz surface whose conformal boundary is not a topological 1-
manifold. For example L∞is wild at inﬁnity since ∂L∞is not locally connected at
P∞. Even the Minkowski plane itself has a noncompact conformal boundary with
four connected components. This paper shows that the conformal boundary of a
simply connected Lorentz surface is always homeomorphic to a dense subspace of
the circle.
The sequence of intervals {[Pn, Qn]}∞
n=1 is called nested and shrinking if [Pn, Qn]
⊃[Pn+1, Qn+1], Pn ̸= Pn+1, Qn ̸= Qn+1 for n = 1, 2, ... and T∞
n=1[Pn, Qn] contains
at most one point. Deﬁne the relation ≃on the set of all nested, shrinking sequences
of ∂L-intervals as follows. Write {[Pn, Qn]} ≃{[Rn, Sn]} if, for any m ∈Z+ there
exists l ∈Z+ such that [Rl, Sl] ⊂[Pm, Qm]. Reﬂexitivity and transitivity of ≃
are trivial. It is also not very hard to show (using Lemmas 1 and 2) that ≃is
symmetric. Deﬁne the space of conformal boundary elements ∂cL as the set of
equivalence classes of ≃. (See the analogous developments involving H-intervals on
pp. 60-62 of [7]. In particular, compare the deﬁnition of ≃above with Theorem
2.14, and Corollary 1, Lemma 4 and Proposition 1 below with Theorem 2.15.)
Lemma 3. If {[Pn, Qn]} and {[Rn, Sn]} represent distinct points of ∂cL, then there
exists N such that [PN, QN] and [RN, SN] are disjoint.
Proof. Since {[Pn, Qn]} ̸≃{[Rn, Sn]} there exists m ∈Z+ such that [Rl, Sl] ̸⊂
[Pm, Qm] for all l ∈Z+. We can assume that T[Rl, Sl] does not equal {Pm} or
{Qm} (by replacing m with m+1 if necessary). Thus there exists k ∈Z+ such that
Pm, Qm ̸∈[Rk, Sk]. By Lemma 2(d), [Pm, Qm] ∩[Rk, Sk] = ∅. The result follows
with N = max{m, k}.
Corollary 1. If T∞
n=1[Pn, Qn] = {P} = T∞
n=1[Rn, Sn] for nested shrinking se-
quences {[Pn, Qn]} and {[Rn, Sn]}, then {[Pn, Qn]} ≃{[Rn, Sn]}.
The separability of ∂L (noted above) yields the following lemma.
Lemma 4. Given P ∈∂L there exists a nested shrinking sequence of intervals
{[Pn, Qn]} with T∞
n=1[Pn, Qn] = {P}.
Proof. Choose points R, S ∈∂L such that R, S and P are distinct. By Lemma
1(c), P ∈(R, S) or P ∈(S, R). In the former case, let P1 = R and Q1 = S.
Otherwise let P1 = S and Q1 = R. Since ∂L is separable, there exist sequences
of points {Ri}∞
i=1 and {Si}∞
i=1 which have dense images in (P1, P) and (P, Q1),
respectively. For n > 1, choose Pn from (Pn−1, P) ∩Tn
i=1(Ri, P) and Qn from
(P, Qn−1) ∩Tn
i=1(P, Si).
The resulting sequence {[Pn, Qn]}∞
n=1 is easily seen to
have the required properties.
The preceding corollary and lemma yield a natural injection ∂L
i,→∂cL, so that
∂L may be identiﬁed as a subspace of ∂cL. Points in ∂cL\∂L may be assigned rank
0. Intervals of boundary elements may be deﬁned as follows. Suppose P, R and
T are distinct points of ∂cL represented by {[Pn, Qn]}, {[Rn, Sn]} and {[Tn, Un]},
respectively. By Lemma 3 we may choose N such that [PN, QN], [RN, SN] and
[TN, UN] are pairwise disjoint. The interval (P, T )c contains the point R if RN ∈
(PN, TN). This deﬁnition is independent of the choice of representatives of P, R and

846

T as well as of the choice of N. For P, Q ∈∂L, (P, Q) = (P, Q)c∩∂L. Notice that if
linear orders are introduced on ∂cL by analogy with the linear orders on ∂L deﬁned
above, <P on ∂cL extends <P on ∂L for each P ∈∂L. The set Lc = L∪∂cL may be
topologized so that ¯L is a subspace. Simply take Bc = {RΓ ∪(P, Q)c : P, Q ∈∂L, Γ
is a trail from P to Q} as a subbase. It is readily seen that ∂cL (with the subspace
topology inherited from Lc) contains ∂L as a dense subset. It should also be noted
that the map ∂f : ∂L →∂ˆL induced by a conformal equivalence f : L →ˆL
between the simply connected Lorentz surfaces L and ˆL takes nested, shrinking
sequences of ∂L-intervals to nested, shrinking sequences of ∂ˆL-intervals in a way
that respects the relation ≃. Thus f induces a map on the conformal boundary
elements ∂cf : ∂cL →∂c ˆL.
Proposition 1. The extended boundary ∂cL is homeomorphic to the circle.
Proof. Begin by deﬁning in stages a map f : ∂cL →[0, 2π). Let {Pn}∞
n=1 be a
sequence of distinct points of ∂L whose image is dense in ∂L. Deﬁne f(P1) = 0
and f(P2) = π. Extend f inductively as follows. Suppose f has been deﬁned on
{P1, ..., Pn} with n ≥2 so that f : ({P2, ..., Pn}, <P1) →((0, 2π), <) is order pre-
serving. If we wish to deﬁne f at Pn+1 so that f : ({P2, ..., Pn+1}, <P1)→((0, 2π), <)
is order preserving, the possible images of Pn+1 constitute one of the connected com-
ponents of (0, 2π)\{f(P2), ..., f(Pn)}. Deﬁne f(Pn+1) to be the midpoint of that
distinguished component. Since f : ({Pn : n = 2, 3, ...}, <P1) →((0, 2π), <) is order
preserving it is one-to-one. The image f({Pn : n = 2, 3, ...}) is dense in (0, 2π).
Suppose P ∗∈∂cL\{Pn : n = 1, 2, ...}. Deﬁne f(P ∗) = sup{f(Pn) : Pn <P1 P ∗}.
The map f : (∂cL\{P1}, <P1) →((0, 2π), <) is order preserving and onto.
The composition eif : ∂cL →S1 is a homeomorphism.
In [4], Klarreich uses the map f of Proposition 1 to characterize the class of
simply connected Lorentz surfaces whose conformal boundaries are C0 smoothable.
The analogy between the procedure used above to pass from Kulkarni’s confor-
mal boundary to the space of conformal boundary elements and Carath´eodory’s
construction of prime ends may be summarized as follows. End rays here take the
place of Jordan half-intervals, while Kulkarni’s boundary points are the analog of
accessible points and conformal boundary elements are the analog of prime ends.
The classiﬁcation of prime ends into 4 kinds is well known. We suggest the fol-
lowing classiﬁcation of conformal boundary elements in the indeﬁnite metric case.
A boundary element in ∂cL is of the ﬁrst kind if it corresponds to a point of ∂L.
If a rank 0 boundary element is isolated in ∂cL\∂L, then it is of the second kind.
Otherwise it is of the third kind. For example, the subspace of E2,1 above the
graph of the greatest integer function has two boundary elements of the third kind,
countably many of the second kind, and uncountably many of the ﬁrst kind.
