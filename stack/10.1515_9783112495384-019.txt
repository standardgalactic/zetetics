Dedicated to Prof. Dr. Dr. h. c. Dr. E . h. P. GÖHLICH on the occasion of his 80th birthday 
The critical behaviour of the random field Ising model is calculated in d = 2 + e dimensions, 
using previous findings on interface roughening of Grinstein and Ma. The critical exponents are 
expressed in terms of £ and the dimension ß/v of the order parameter field, e and ß/v are assumed 
to be small. For nonvanishing random field strength H K the critical behaviour is governed by 
a zero temperature fixed point line ~ (e + 2ß/v)3li. In particular fi = 3/4 and v'1 = -§- (e + 2/S/v) 
are obtained for the interface tension and the correlation length exponent, respectively. The rela-
tion between interface and bulk correlation lengths in the various regions is discussed. 
Das kritische Verhalten des Ising-Modells in einem Zufallsfeld wird in (d — 2 -f f (-Dimensionen 
mit der schon früher von Grinstein und Ma gefundenen Grenzflächenrauhigkeit berechnet. Die 
kritischen Exponenten werden über e und die Dimension ßjv des Ordnungsparameterfeldes aus-
gedrückt. Es wird angenommen, daß s und ß/v klein sind. Für eine nichtverschwindende Stärke des 
Zufallsfeldes HR wird das kritische Verhalten durch einen T = 0 Fixpunkt HRC ~ (e + 2/?/i>)3/4 
bestimmt. Speziell für den Grenzflächenspannungs- und den Korrelationslängenexponenten 
werden die Werte ß = 3/4 und v'1 = -§ (e + 2ß/v) erhalten. Die Beziehung zwischen Grenz-
flächen- und Volumen-Korrelationslänge in verschiedenen Bereichen wird diskutiert. 
1. Introduction 
The drastic effects of random fields (RF) on the behaviour of Ising-like models have 
been debated extensively in recent years. Stability analysis of the ordered state initiated 
by Imry and Ma [1] yields dl = 2 as the lower critical dimension (l.c.d.), below which 
no long-range order is present. This result has been called into question by results of 
a perturbation theory around the upper critical dimension dc = 6, which gave a 
dimensionality shift by two between the R F and the pure Ising model [2], This 
suggests d, = 
+ 2 == 3. In an interlude people tried to understand a l.c.d. equal 
to three in terms of the Imry-Ma argument by domain wall roughening which might 
lower the domain wall energy and hence lead to a destabilization of the ferromagnetic 
state for d < 3 even at T = 0 [3]. Deeper consideration, however, showed that walls 
become actually rough, but the corresponding lowering of wall energy is not strong 
enough to shift the l.c.d., thus dt = 2 [4, 5]. More detailed information about this 
development as well as references can be found in review papers [6, 7]. 
The present status of our knowledge of the critical behaviour of the R F Ising model 
(RFIM) is unsatisfactory. The above-mentioned perturbation theory, which works in 
6 — s dimensions breaks probably down below four or five dimensions because of 
the existence of metastable states [7].

In their paper Aharony et al. [2] also raised the possibility of a reduction in dimen-
sion such that the properties of the d-dimensional RFIM are those of the «^-dimen-
sional pure Ising model with 
d0 = d - 2 + r]0(d0) , 
(1.1) 
where r]0(d0) = rj(d) is the critical exponent of the pure system in d0 or of the RFIM 
in d dimensions. Since r)0(dm = 1) = 1, i.e. d{ = d0i + 1 but r]0(doc) = 0, i.e., dc = 
= doc + 2, (1.1) would reconcile domain arguments with perturbation theory. 
Schwartz [8] rederived (1.1) by relating the RFIM with quenched disorder to a cor-
responding annealed problem. 
Using a non-perturbative approach, which treats basically the local response of 
the system, Shapir [9] finds a reduction 
d0 = d 
j j - 
if 
oc0(d0) > 0, 
"oK) 
(1.2) 
d0 = i (
d +
i
f 
This yields again d, = 2. More interesting, according to (1.2) the critical properties 
of the RFIM in d = 3 dimensions should be those of the two-dimensional Ising model. 
In particular, the predictions <x = 0 and v = 1 are in agreement with specific heat, 
birefringence, and heat capacitance experiments [10]. We note however, that although 
important for fitting the experimental data, (1.2) probably does not describe the true 
equilibrium properties of RFIM. 
In the present paper, we try to extract the critical properties of the RFIM from the 
behaviour of interfaces close to the critical point. The approach is oriented on — 
although at present less profounded than — the interface calculations for pure models 
as invented by Wallace andZia [11], Our calculation is based on the results of Grinstein 
and Ma (GM) [4] for the fluctuation renormalized interface tension. However, in order 
to enter the critical region we have to alter their expressions in a self-consistent way. 
The results should be valid in d — 2 + e dimensions. As for pure models, we are not 
able to obtain the exponent /? (or rj) from interface calculations alone. This requires 
the consideration of a multi-droplet ensemble [11]. Unfortunately, contrary to the 
pure problem, even the determination of v involves ¡3 in the present case. To lowest 
order in e and 2/?/i> 
we get 
Together with ¡ji = -f- for the surface tension exponent and the modified hyperscaling 
relation (4.6) other exponents can be found once /? is given. Despite this modest 
achievement we hope that the present study motivates further investigations in this 
direction. 
2. Interface Fluctuations. The T = 0 Case 
Grinstein and Ma [4] start from the following Hamiltonian for the distortions f(r) 
of an interface in the RFIM : 
m 
X = f d*-ir [<r0 /1 + (V/)2 - J dz 0(r, z) HR(r, z)] . 
(2.1) 
o 
(T0 denotes the bare interface tension, including, say, interface fluctuations on a length 
scale q 
go with q0 arbitrary but fixed. A natural choice for o0 would be o0 ss; f 0 where 
£0 denotes the interface width at vanishing disorder: T = II  = 0. Below we use 
eo =

HR(r), r = {r, z) is a Gaussian correlated random field with 
HAr) = 0 , 
HR(r) Hn(r') = Hi 8(r - r') . 
(2.2) 
The bar denotes the configurational average. The bulk order parameter &(r) was 
set equal to unity in GM's original treatment. Below we use the notation H(r) = 
= HR{r) 0{r) etc. 
Neglecting the change of the short-distance cut-off q0, the scale transformation 
(b> 
1) 
r — br', 
z — bz', 
f — bf, 
g — bg' 
(2.3) 
leaves 3€¡T invariant, provided we set 
T' = W--dT, 
H' = bV~dV2H. 
(2.3') 
GM calculate now the change Aa1 of the interface tension by integrating over fluctua-
tions on the scale g0 ... bg0. This scale transformation and integration is repeated many 
times until we reach a macroscopic scale. The interface tension after the w-th re-
normalization group (RNG) step is 
On = o0 + £ Aff, , 
(2.4) 
where for T = 0 (Al = 1) [4, 5] 
A a, = -C ^ 
Al; 
Hl = HbM-MV. 
(2.5) 
C is a constant of order unity which could not be determined within the crude ap-
proximation scheme of GM. Below we absorb C in the definition of HR. As an im-
portant restriction GM ignore any new terms which may be generated by the elimi-
nation of the short-wavelength degrees of freedom and so just keep the two variables 
T and H at each stage. Further Hi/cr0 had to be assumed to be small. This restricts 
the calculation in general to H much smaller than the critical field strength Hc where 
the randomness disorders the system (dy- dt = 2). 
In order to extract critical properties from the GM results, we introduce two impor-
tant alterations: 
(i) It is in the spirit of the RNG calculus to make the computation self-consistent 
by replacing a0 by the true interface tension Oi on the scale q = bt. For an infinitesimal 
scale change Al —> dZ = dg/g In b we get from (2.5) 
provided ht = Hijoi 
1 now. For simplicity we have chosen b = e. 
(ii) Close to the critical point it is important to take into account the scaling proper-
ties of the order parameter. Thus, instead of (2.5), we use 
2-d 
Id —2 \ 
Ht = Hr e 2 0t = Hu e A 2 
) y t f / S ) , 
(2.7) 
where A = ¡¡¡v with ¡3 and v are the exponents of the order parameter and bulk 
correlation length f, <p(x) a; 1, xA for x —• 0, x — oo, respectively. 
(2.7) can be understood as follows. Ht is essentially given by 
Hf « 
/ d<V - r') HRJ(r) 0,(r) HR,,(r') <Dt(r') 
|r-r'|£l 
J 
drf(r - r') HR(r el) &(r el) HR(r 
e!) &(r' el) . 
(2.7') 
-r'|<l

Th. Nattermann 
For el 
£ the main contribution to Ht arises from terms on the right-hand side of 
(2.7'), where 0 is replaced by & ~ f-^". Together with (2.2) this yields (2.7) for 
x = e'/f 
1. On the contrary, for f 
e' we are in the scaling region where &{r el) = 
= eIA 0(r), A denotes the dimensionality of the field. This yields (2.7) for x <t, \. No 
further renomalization of H E besides the trivial one has been assumed! 
The introduction of a non-zero A and of £ look rather artificial at this point. It 
has no counterpart in the treatment of the corresponding pure model [11]. However, 
for a consistent description of the R F model, it is necessary to take into account the 
change of the coupling strength between the R F and the interface distortion due to 
fluctuations right and left from the interface (e.g. domains within domains). 
From (2.6), (2.7) we get for hi = H,/oi

(2.8) has an ultraviolet stable fixpoint, 
(2.8) 
(2.8') 
For ht < hc, ht is iterated to zero under the RNG flow. On the contrary, for ht 
hc, 
hi increases, leaving finally the domain of validity of our approach. Since hc is infrared 
unstable, it is tempting to identify it with a critical point. Because of the condition 
ht 
1 our treatment is restricted to dimensionalities d — 2 + 2 A < ^ 1 . Since we 
expect that the critical point vanishes for d —• 2, A should vanish as well. Thus, we 
have to assume A — 2 = e 
1. 
Integration of (2.6) between I* and I yields 
of/» = a\lZ - h-*ls(Ht's - Htl3) . 
(2.9) 
Actually, Ht on the right-hand side of (2.9) is now given by (2.7) with q> replaced by 
a new cross-over function ^(e'/f) with

Since we are restricted so far to T = 0, it is natural to choose q* = 1 , i.e. Oi» = <r0 in

denotes the scale on which the interface is locally 
fuzzy. 
To show this, we consider 
the expression for the mean-square interface width on the scale Q, W2(Q) = F2 (equa-
tion (3.29) of [4]). To be consistent with our above approach, we replace again <r0 by 
CT(Q) and H 
by H Q ~

(PIG/^). 
W(Q)

(2.15) 
(2.16) 
For Q 5S A, the typical gradient of the interface is of order unity, or larger, i.e. the 
interface is fuzzy. In particular, for Q ^ ^ we get from (2.10) to (2.12)) and (2.16)

In the critical region only a single length scale should exist and hence 
« f has 
to be expected. We come back to this point in Section 5.

i.e. Xi decreases strongly (A

Thence there is a critical value lc such that xt <[ s for I > lc, and e 
1 fixed. On 
scales i > ic we may use the results of Section 2, identifying lc with I*. 
In principle we can integrate da/dl between 1 = 0 and I = lc, using (3.2) and (3.1) 
for Xi 
1 and xt 
1, respectively. As a result, we get ai,. with lc, rric depending on 
T, H, c0 (and e). Since the conditions d — 2 
1 and d — 1

we do not try here to find the explicit T- and .ff-dependence of cr?c from (3.1), (3.2), 
but assume that the resulting 
He = H(el°, au) = h(Hn,

(cf. (2.11)) leads to a unique solution Hn = H0{T) (or T^H^)) of 
HR =

4. Scaling and Critical Exponents 
It is the aim of this section to calculate the critical exponents of the RFIM from the 
results obtained above. As mentioned already in Section 2, one should expect only 
a single length scale £ ~ 
in the critical region. To substantiate this belief, we con-
sider the scaling behaviour of kH by approaching Tc(H-n) for H n fixed.

Thus I/a0 > 1 for |i| < \t„\ if d < 6.

theory gives vT = 3/2(d — 1), i.e. XT grows faster than f for d < 4 such that we get 
XT ~ f for |i| — \tT\ = (7/<r0)2,(4_rf). tT is theGinzburg critical region of the pure model 
as can be easily shown from (4.3). The corresponding graph is depicted in Fig. 2b. 
We conclude from these two examples that within interface models the Levanyuk-
Ginzburg critical region is characterized by A —• f, where A scales the large-scale inter-
face roughening and f denotes the bulk correlation length. 
For weak fields such that \tH\ 
|i| 
\ tT\, exponents get renormalized by thermal 
fluctuations. Using the classical hyperscaling relation (we use the subscript zero for 
the exponents of the pure model), 
v0d = 2 — a0 
(4.5) 
and <% + 2/? + y = 2, we get /j, = fi0 = v0{d — 1) , vH = [vj(d — 2)] (d — rj0) > v0. 
In this case XH « f

For d < 4, \iH\ < \tH\ and the R F 
Ginzburg region is given by \tH\.

Villain [12] has shown that XH(tH) characterizes the 
minimal size of metastable domains in the vicinity of TC(H). 
In the last part of this section we consider the region |i| < |iH|. The approach has 
certain speculative aspects. The essential point is the assumption of the hyperscaling 
relation 
v(d - 2 + rj) = 2 — a

which replaces (4.5). (4.6) is usually derived from a variation of a Pippard argument 
[2,6] (see also [8]). An alternative derivation goes as follows. In a homogeneous external 
field h, | ~ 
for T = Tc. For a correlated region t1 there is an average excess 
field h ~ 
or £ ~ {hjH)-^d. 
Thus, ft + y = vd/2 which yields with the ¿-inde-
pendent scaling law 2(/S + y) = 2 — <x + j>(2 — rj) (4.6). Inserting (4.6) into (4.1) 
yields 
p = v{d — 3 + rj) ; 
vH = v . 
(4.7) 
From (2.18) vH = "i + (n — v) 2A/(d — 2) which gives with (4.7) 
v1 = v. 
(4.8) 
We come now back to the results of Section 2. From (2.10), (2.13), (4.7), (4.8), and

Since the present approach does not determine /S (typical for interface calculations 
[11]), we are even not able to determine v (typical for the RFIM because of the special 
coupling between the disorder and the interface coordinate). Assuming /3 <^ oo, 
for d —* 2 v —* oo, a —» —oo, r] —• 1, in agreement with previous findings [9] and the 
common expectations at the l.c.d. 
In order to get results for d = 3 we have to make an assumption about the value of /?. 
From their Monte Carlo data for the RFIM Landau and coworkers [13] find /3 = 0.2 
in d = 3 dimensions. Using this value we get v = 1.1, r] = 0.68, y = 1.45, « = 0.15. 
The value for y is somewhat larger than y = 1.40 found by Khurana et al. [14] from 
a high-temperature expansion. Also v and tx are larger than the experimental values 
»1 « 1 and a ^ 0 [10]. However, the £-expansion around the l.c.d. is usually believed 
to give less satisfactory agreement with the true exponents than other approaches 
potentially do. Moreover, it is rather likely that present experiments do not reveal 
the real equilibrium properties of the system but merely probe the behaviour in a 
certain metastable state. 
Within the present approach the next work to be done should be the determination 
of Plv from a multi-droplet theory as worked out by Bruce and Wallace [11] for the 
pure case. It would be also important to see, how a systematic expansion in e could 
be constructed. This task includes the determination of higher-order terms in the 
Gell-Mann-Low function (2.8), which is probably very hard. Moreover, it would be 
more satisfactory if one could avoid the use of the hyperscaling relation (4.6) or, 
possibly, to prove it to a certain order in e.

Note added in proof: 
After submitting this paper for publication we received two very interesting preprints by Villain [a] 
and Bray and Moore [b] who derived scaling relations between three independent exponents. In our 
notation, the third exponent results from a non-trivial renormalization of H
A 
= (JIv — f/2 with 
£ J> 0 and likely 'Q —> 0 for d —>• 2. £ is related to the anomalous dimension rj entering the disconnect-
ed part of the correlation function, rj = 2»? — £. 
Since T is a dangerous irrelevant variable, the hyperscaling relation is modified to v(d + At) = 
= 2 — <x where /.t denotes the thermal eigenvalue of the RNG recursion relation linearized at the 
zero temperature fixed point hc [c]. From da/dl = Hi • F(ht, tt), (2.7) and (3.3) At = ( — d/2) + A = 
= — 2 + rj — £, irrespective of the details of the function F'. The ¿-independent scaling laws rem-
ain unchanged. Hence, if £ > 0, /i = v(d — 1 + At), v_1 = 2(e + 2A)/3, the other exponents are 
related to v via the modified scaling relations. Contrasting theoretical results are 
= 2e/3 [a] 
and 
= 
£ = /? = 0 [b], respectively, whereas Birgenau et al. [d] found recently v = 1.52 + 
+ 0.13 for a 3-dimensional experimental realization of the RFIM. The latter would be in accord 
with our results if A — 0.
