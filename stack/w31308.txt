ABSTRACT
We study migration in the right tail of the talent distribution using a novel dataset of Indian high 
school students taking the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), a college entrance exam used for 
admission to the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT). We find a high incidence of 
migration after students complete college: among the top 1,000 scorers on the exam, 36% have 
migrated abroad, rising to 62%for the top 100 scorers. We next document that students who 
attended the original “Top 5” Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) were 5 percentage points 
more likely to migrate for graduate school compared to equally talented students who studied in 
other institutions. We explore two mechanisms for these patterns: signaling, for which we study 
migration after one university suddenly gained the IIT designation; and alumni networks, using 
information on the location of IIT alumni in U.S. computer science departments.

1. Introduction 
Highly skilled immigrants make important contributions to innovation and technology in 
the United States. Often, they study in elite universities in their home countries before getting 
advanced degrees abroad. For example, many successful Indian immigrants in the technology 
industry—including Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc./Google, and Arvind Krishna, the 
CEO of IBM—are undergraduate alumni of the selective Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). 
Similarly, Chinese students in U.S. Ph.D. programs overwhelmingly come from a set of highly 
selective Chinese universities (Gaulé and Piacentini, 2013).  
In this paper, we study migration in the very right tail of the talent distribution for high 
school students in India, focusing on the extent to which elite universities in their home country 
facilitate migration. We focus on the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The IITs are 
prestigious and highly selective technical universities with lower acceptance rates than Ivy League 
colleges, particularly for the original five IIT Campuses.1 Admission to the IITs is solely through 
the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), where nearly one million exam takers compete for less than ten 
thousand spots. Desai, Kapur, McHale, and Rogers (2009) document anecdotal evidence related 
to the role of elite institutions in India, such as the IITs and the All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences, in facilitating skilled migration to the United States. IIT students have even been 
described as “America’s most valuable import from India” (Leung, 2003). 
Emigration is often difficult to observe from administrative datasets, and few surveys have 
been conducted with a focus on top talent that are not selected on future success or mobility.2 We 
were able to overcome these challenges by leveraging the unanticipated public release of the names 
and scores of JEE exam takers in 2010, combined with an intensive manual collection effort on 
exam takers’ outcomes. The result is a novel dataset of high school students who took the JEE 
exam, linked to college attended and later career, education, and migration outcomes. The data 
provides individuals’ scores received on the exam and their national ranking. An important feature

2 Survey evidence of Indian academics suggests that academic performance and educational institutions attended 
matter for later international mobility, but focusing on academics leads to a sample more likely to be mobile and 
selected on later success (Czaika and Toma, 2017).   

3 
 
of the data is that we can observe the whole set of IITs and majors an individual could have chosen 
to attend, since admission to an IIT and a major course of study are based solely on the JEE score. 
First, we document a salient correlation between an individual’s score on the JEE exam 
and migration up to eight years later among the top exam takers. Among the top 100 scorers, for 
instance, 62% have migrated abroad, primarily to the U.S. and for graduate school. Among the top 
1,000 scorers, 36% have migrated abroad, which is still sizeable but much lower.  
Among students in the top end of the score distribution (top 0.2% of test takers), we find 
that holding JEE score fixed, those who attended one of the five most prestigious IITs are 4 
percentage points more likely to migrate than equally high-scoring students who attended other 
universities. These similarly talented students attended other institutions in the IIT system, such as 
IIT Roorkee, IIT Guwahati, or BHU Varanasi, which are organized along similar lines but are 
relatively less prestigious. The effects are mainly driven by migrating for graduate school and a 
Ph.D., specifically, while there is no significant effect for migrating for work.3   
We next investigate what mechanisms can explain these patterns. First, we examine 
whether, among students with identical JEE scores, if those who attend a Top 5 IIT are likely to 
select different majors, thus providing students with different types of human capital. While 
students attending a Top 5 do have different majors on average compared to those who do not, we 
obtain similar results when we control for the major area of study. Second, elite universities could 
be a signal of quality, effectively solving an information friction about a potential migrant’s ability 
or quality of their human capital to future employers or graduate programs. To explore the role of 
signaling, we leverage a natural experiment when one institution (Banaras Hindu University, 
BHU) unexpectedly received IIT status, without any concomitant changes to its staff or 
curriculum.4  Comparing students who enrolled at BHU before the change was made, we find that 
                                                            
3  In order to develop a better understanding of the drivers of migration for work in this setting, we conducted several 
field interviews with placement offices at the IITs. Our interviews revealed that top multinationals had been hiring IIT 
graduates for their local subsidiaries in India well before the period of study (e.g., McKinsey in 1992, BCG in 1995, 
Microsoft in 1990, Goldman Sachs in 2006), while the American offices of these firms were explicitly barred from 
recruiting directly from the IITs. Individuals who migrated to the U.S. for work often do so by transferring within 
these companies (or after acquiring some work experience in India). By contrast, individuals migrating for graduate 
school would typically do so right after their IIT degree. We suggest that the signalling value of having a Top 5 IIT 
degree may be less relevant for people who have work experience, since the work experience itself reveals important 
information, in particular for transfers within a firm. 
4 As we discuss later in Section 6, discussions on granting IIT status to BHU had been ongoing since the 1970s. 
Thus, while BHU becoming an IIT was a possibility, prospective students could not anticipate whether this change 
would have occurred by the time they graduated. 

4 
 
students who (plausibly exogenously) received an IIT degree were 10 percentage points more 
likely to migrate than those of preceding cohorts. 
The BHU experience allows us to separately identify the signaling value of an IIT degree, 
as the quality of education/human capital acquired by the students in the cohorts before and after 
the change remained constant, while only the name of the university on the degree received 
differed. Importantly, the unanticipated nature of the change implies that we are comparing 
students who were not expecting to receive an IIT degree and would be similar in terms of 
unobservable factors such as motivation or ambition. 
Another possible mechanism is that students attending elite universities may become part 
of a network of successful alumni and faculty, many of whom have migrated, and this network can 
facilitate migration. Prior literature has shown the role of such diaspora networks in lowering 
migration costs and increasing migration flows, but this literature has not focused on extremely 
highly skilled migrant networks as we do here (Beine, Docquier, and Özden, 2011). To examine 
the role of networks, we conduct a case study of which U.S. computer science Ph.D. programs IIT 
graduates attend. We find that the number of alumni of one’s own IIT among a U.S. computer 
science department’s faculty is positively associated with attending that department for a Ph.D. By 
contrast, we find no such association for the number of alumni of other IITs. 
Overall, our results suggest that elite schools play a key role in shaping migration 
outcomes, both in terms of the overall propensity and the particular migration destination. The 
BHU evidence suggests that the quality of acquired human capital does not appear to be the 
mechanism driving this phenomenon. Our evidence, rather, supports the view of elite education as 
mainly signaling a potential migrant’s ability or quality of their human capital, and providing 
access to valuable networks. U.S. graduate programs—a key pathway for migration—are 
especially keen to recruit the best and brightest. However, to identify the best and brightest, they 
must rely on external information and signals, and elite home universities may provide these. 
Our paper contributes to the literature on the international migration of highly skilled 
individuals. International migration, particularly high-skilled migration, is often facilitated by 
institutional actors. Recent literature has documented the important role firms play in facilitating 
skilled migration (Kerr and Lincoln, 2010; Clemens, 2013; Kerr, Kerr, and Lincoln, 2015; 
Choudhury and Kim, 2019).  In this paper, we argue that other institutional actors, i.e., elite 

5 
 
universities, play an important role in facilitating skilled migration of talent from emerging to 
developed countries.5  
While prior migration literature has documented the role of universities from the demand 
side (e.g., Borjas and Doran, 2012, 2015; Amornsiripanitch, et al., 2021) and the significant 
enrollment of students from India in U.S. graduate programs (Bound, et al., 2021), arguably an 
important gap remains relative to studying elite universities from the supply side, i.e., as facilitators 
of skilled migration. In particular, while Kerr, Kerr, Özden, and Parsons (2016) postulate that host 
country universities facilitate high-skilled migration through admission decisions, our paper 
additionally sheds light on the agency of home country elite universities in facilitating high-skilled 
migration through the twin mechanisms of signaling and networks.  
Our paper also complements extant literature that studies high-skilled migrants in the 
context of U.S. universities (e.g., Kahn and MacGarvie, 2020), the literature on migration patterns 
of the best and brightest academic performers from other countries (e.g., Gibson and McKenzie, 
2011; Gibson and McKenzie, 2012; Agarwal, et al. 2023) and the literature on skill selectivity of 
migrants (Saint-Paul, 2004; Docquier and Marfouk, 2006; Docquier and Rapoport, 2012; Grogger 
and Hanson, 2011, Kerr, et al., 2016).  
Finally, our paper contributes to the literature on the labor market returns to attending 
selective colleges. In general, the findings on the impact of attending an elite college have been 
mixed (e.g., Dale and Krueger, 2002; Pop-Eleches and Urquiola, 2013; Abdulkadiroğlu, Angrist, 
and Pathak, 2014; Zimmerman, 2019). Interestingly, this literature tends not to find effects of 
college selectivity on earnings in the U.S., but some effects on earnings and career outcomes in 
Italy (Anelli, 2020) and in several developing country contexts, including Chile (Zimmerman, 
2019), India (Sekhri, 2020; Bertrand, Hanna, and Mullainathan, 2010) and Colombia (Barrera-
Osorio and Bayona-Rodriguez, 2019). These effects tend to appear to be driven by signaling or 
networks, complementary to our findings regarding the  attending an elite home country institution 
and migration.   
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides historical background on the 
development of the IITs and details about the admissions process. Section 3 describes the data,

followed by the potential mechanisms in Section 6. Section 7 concludes. 
2. IITs: Historical Background and Context 
As India transitioned to independence after World War II, national leaders sought to 
establish higher education institutions focused on developing India’s technological capacity. The 
institutions would conduct research in addition to teaching undergraduate and postgraduate 
students. Prominent IIT alumni include current CEO of Google and Alphabet Sundar Pichai,  Sun 
Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla, and former IMF Chief Economist Raghuram Rajan. 
The first of these higher technical institutions—called the Indian Institute of Technology—
was founded in 1951 in Kharagpur. Over the following decade, another four IIT campuses opened: 
in Bombay (1958), Kanpur (1959), Madras (1959), and Delhi (1961). The five original IITs were 
spread across the country, each located in a different region.  
The Institutes expanded in the late 1990s and early 2000s to include 23 branches (see 
Appendix Table A1). A few of the new branches—including IIT (BHU) Varanasi—were 
converted from existing institutions, which we will leverage in our analysis. We will refer to the 
five initial campuses as the “Top 5” IITs, as they have stronger reputations and rank higher than 
the newer institutes (for the locations of the Top 5 IITs, see Appendix Figure A1).6  
 
At the undergraduate level, admissions to the IIT system are determined solely based on 
student performance on the annual Joint Entrance Examination (JEE), a centrally administered 
exam covering mathematics, chemistry, and physics. The competition is fierce; in 2010, for 
instance, around 450,000 individuals took the JEE, competing for less than 10,000 IIT places. 
Some IIT spots are reserved for special categories, including individuals from disadvantaged 
castes. We focus here on the general category where the majority of participants compete. 
After the JEE results are released, test takers rank their top institution and major pairs (e.g., 
IIT Delhi/Electrical Engineering). Seats are then allocated by rank, with each student in turn 
“allotted” to their top still available institution-major seat.7  The most popular combinations fill up 
                                                            
6 “QS India University Rankings 2020.” https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/rankings-by-
location/india/2020, accessed May 16, 2023. 
7 Test takers indicate their preferences for particular IIT/course combinations after finding out their own scores, 
while also knowing the likely cut-offs for entering particular IIT/course combinations. Therefore, strategic 

7 
 
quickly: IIT Bombay/Computer Science, for instance, only has around 40 seats available, and a 
rank of 100 in India would not be sufficient for admittance to that particular program (for opening 
and closing ranks for key institution/major combinations, see Appendix Table A2). 
Instead of attending an IIT, test takers may attend a variety of other institutions, with the 
most popular options being the Birla Institute of Technology (BITS Pilani, ranked among the top 
10 engineering colleges in India in 20208) and one of the National Institutes of Technology or 
NITs (see Appendix Table A3). Admission into the NITs is also based on the JEE examination.9   
3. Data 
Studying who migrates, empirically, is challenging since it requires information both about 
stayers and migrants. Few surveys have been conducted with a specific focus (or good coverage 
of) top talent.10 To overcome the lack of relevant survey data, we use observational data generated 
by the unanticipated public posting of the results of the 2010 JEE online.11, 12 The data released 
included full name and scores (math, chemistry, and physics). After receiving their JEE results, 
students enter the “allotment process” by which they are matched to institutions and major 
according to their preferences, rank, and available seats. We observe the result of this allotment 
process in the released JEE data, which in turn gives a good indication of where individuals studied 
                                                            
behaviour in choosing particular IIT/course combinations is not a major issue, unlike in the case of similarly 
selective exams where preferences are indicated in advance of taking the exam.

10 One exception is Agarwal, et al. (2023), who survey around 500 former participants in the International 
Mathematical Olympiads, with a focus on the decision to migrate for undergraduate studies. 
11 Abhay Rana, a programmer also known as Nemo, found a way to scrape the JEE 2010 results and released them at 
https://captnemo.in/projects/iitjee/. Previously, the results of the JEE 2009 had been released in bulk format on the 
IIT-JEE website. Both the JEE 2010 and JEE 2009 data include names and scores, but the JEE 2010 data also includes 
the allotted institution and course course. 
12 The use in research of potentially confidential data made publicly available through third parties is potentially 
controversial. A recent example of such use is Alstadsæter, Johannesen, and Zucman (2019), who combine the 
“Panama papers” with administrative wealth records in Scandinavia to study tax evasion. Relatedly, Braguinsky, 
Mityakov, and Liscovich (2010) and Braguinsky and Mityakov (2015) use leaked administrative income data on 
Moscow citizens to shed light on issues of transparency and hidden earnings. In contrast to these studies, the data we 
use is rather less sensitive and confidential. Indeed, every year the names and scores of the top JEE scorers tend to be 
publicized by both coaching and testing centers. Moreover, following a freedom of information request, the Indian 
government released the full results of the 2009 JEE exams through the IIT-JEE website. The data released included 
information on names, names of the parents, scores, and locality for more than 400,000 individuals. The data we use 
is considerably smaller and generally has less information, but has the advantage of including the IIT and major 
individuals have chosen. 

8 
 
for their undergraduate degree.13 To complement the released JEE data, we systemically collected 
data on migration outcomes through an intensive manual data collection effort. Given the costs 
involved in the data collection, we focused on test takers from the very top (scoring 243 and above, 
corresponding to roughly the top 2,500 scorers in the general category). Summary statistics of 
individuals are shown in Table 1. Appendix Figure A2 shows the distribution of total scorers for 
whom we manually collected outcomes. Individuals in this range would have the option to attend 
a Top 5 IIT in their choice set. Our final sample includes 2,470 test takers. The data collection 
team used various sources to locate outcomes for individuals, including LinkedIn profiles, College 
alumni yearbooks, Github, AngelList, ResearchGate, and other sources. In searching for 
individuals, we leveraged the fact that we know not only their names but also the undergraduate 
institution they attended, and when they finished high school. We were able to find career and 
education histories (and thus directly infer migration information) for close to 90% of the sample. 
For the remainder, we assume that they have not migrated. We believe that this is a reasonable 
assumption given the widespread prevalence of LinkedIn in the U.S. (the main migration 
destination among identified migrants) and the sectors in which IIT graduates tend to work. For 
instance, in 2022, LinkedIn was reported to have 175 million U.S. users, compared to a U.S. 
working-age population of 205 million. In the results section, we conduct sensitivity checks to 
alternative assumptions on the migration status of individuals with missing career histories.  
(Insert Table 1 About Here) 
We additionally collected outcomes for scorers lower in the score distribution, in ranks 
5,000 to 8,291, corresponding to scores of 197‒220. However, we were only able to find migration 
outcomes for 68% of individuals in this sample. Individuals in this range (ranks 5,000 to 8,291) 
would have the option to attend a less prestigious IIT, but not one of the Top 5 IITs. Given the 
lower quality of this data, we only use it descriptively, to assess the share of migrants by score and 
rank (as in Figure 1), but not in the main analysis. 
4. Empirical Strategy 
                                                            
13 In a few cases, students may not actually attend the institution to which they have been allotted. We checked the 
incidence of that and it seems to concern only a handful of cases. Moreover, there are few individuals (less than 1% 
of the sample) whose allotment status is missing; those are excluded from the analysis.  

9 
 
Our empirical analysis compares migration outcomes of individuals who had the same 
score in the Joint Entrance Exam governing entry to the Indian Institutes of Technology. By 
comparing individuals with the same score, we control not just for ability (or prior stock of human 
capital) but also for the choice set faced by individuals. Indeed, a key advantage of our setting is 
that admissions are offered purely on the score in the Joint Entrance Exam and do not factor in 
unobservables such as essay quality, as would be the case in the U.S. context (Dale and Krueger, 
2002, Arcidiacono, Kinsler, and Ransom, 2020).  
In our main analysis, we run the following regression at the individual level: 
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝛼𝛼+ 𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇5𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽2𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ ∑𝟏𝟏(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗
+ 𝜀𝜀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖                  (1) 
Where i indexes individual exam takers and j exam scores (sum of mathematics, chemistry, 
and physics scores), with j being the score obtained by individual i. 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an indicator 
variable for whether the individual migrated out of India after graduation (in some specifications, 
we distinguish whether the individual migrated for graduate school—Ph.D. or Masters—or 
migrated for work). 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇5𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 is an indicator variable for attending one of the five original IITs 
(IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Madras, and IIT Delhi). Technically, we observe 
which IIT individuals are “allotted” to attend, but this matches very closely with the institution 
individuals actually attend in our sample. 
∑𝟏𝟏(𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)𝑗𝑗
𝑗𝑗
 is a set of score fixed effects and 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of individual characteristics, 
including gender and major. By including score fixed effects, we compare equally talented students 
who scored high enough to study in a Top 5 IIT but chose not to attend.   
As discussed earlier, selection by colleges is based on a student’s entrance exam score, and 
we can control for scores directly in our regressions. However, there could be endogenous 
enrollment decisions in this setting or self-selection into IIT attendance, for instance, if individuals 
who are more motivated to migrate are also more likely to attend a Top 5 IIT. If so, our analysis 
would overstate the causal effect of attending a Top 5 IIT on migration.  
A regression discontinuity research design based on scores in the Joint Entrance Exam 
would alleviate such concerns most effectively. However, there are no clear thresholds in JEE 
score that would lead to a large jump in IIT attendance, which prevents us from estimating the 
impact on the marginal attendee. For instance, as shown in Appendix Figure A3, the minimum 

10 
 
rank that allows entry into a Top 5 IIT is 6,653, yet the share of scorers just above this rank going 
to a Top 5 IIT is quite low. The reason is that a score in this range would only suffice for an 
unpopular major at a Top 5 IIT (e.g., architecture rather than computer science) and that other IITs 
or engineering colleges are effectively more appealing. Similar issues apply to other plausible 
thresholds.14  
5. Association of Test Scores with Migration and IIT Attendance 
5a. Migration 
We first document that a large share of JEE test-takers eventually migrate abroad and, more 
generally, that the incidence is very high at the extreme right tail of the distribution. Figure 1 shows 
the share of migrants across the score distribution and the share migrating for graduate school. 
Among the top 10 scorers, nine have migrated. Among the top 100 scorers, 62% have migrated, 
and 36% among the top 1,000. While the incidence of migration is sizeable throughout our sample, 
it is striking that it increases dramatically towards the extreme right tail of the score distribution. 
To put things in perspective, more than 20 million people were born in India in 1992 and reached 
age 18 in 2010. Thus, the top 1,000 scorers corresponds to 0.2% of the test takers and to 0.00005% 
of the birth cohort.   
(Insert Figure 1 About Here) 
The U.S. is the main destination country, with 65% of the migrants heading to the US, 3% 
to Canada, 5% to the UK, and 16% to other countries (see Appendix Figure A4). Regarding the 
type of migration, as evident from Figure 1, most individuals are migrating for graduate school. In 
our sample, 83% of individuals migrated to pursue a Master's or Ph.D. degree, with only 17% 
migrating for work. Among the top 10 scorers, only four migrated for graduate school and the 
others to work. The dominant type of migration in our sample is thus migrants going to graduate 
school in the United States. Naturally, these migrants may subsequently work in the U.S., but they 
first come to the U.S. as students. 
                                                            
14 In a study of affirmative action and the returns to attending engineering colleges in one Indian state, Bertrand, et 
al. (2010) note that a regression discontinuity approach was not possible due to the strenuous data requirements. 
Data requirements also prevent us from implementing an IV strategy à la Kirkeboen, Leuven, and Mogstad (2016), 
who study returns to studying different majors using rich Norwegian administrative data. 

11 
 
5b. Determinants of Top 5 IIT Attendance 
A key concern in estimating the relationship between attending a Top 5 IIT and migration 
is the role of selection or endogenous enrollment decisions. As discussed earlier, attendance is 
determined solely by performance on the JEE exam, which also gives us a measure of ability that 
we can control for. However, there could be concerns about endogenous enrollment if certain 
individuals choose to attend a Top 5, and observed or unobserved factors are correlated with our 
outcome of interest (migration). While we cannot determine to what extent selection on 
unobservables plays, we next examine the determinants of Top 5 IIT attendance focusing on the 
observable characteristics we have in our data about test takers: gender and geography. Prior work 
shows that having to travel further to school or college is associated with higher costs, and distance 
to a school or college is used as an instrument for educational attainment (e.g., Card, 1995).   
Research has also suggested that women may differentially respond to the increased costs of 
traveling to a college further away from home. Borker (2021), for example, shows that in Delhi, 
women are willing to attend a lower quality college if the travel route is perceived to be unsafe.   
Thus, gender and geography are important determinants of college attendance in some 
settings, but it is unclear whether they will play a similar role in this sample of top talent aiming 
to attend elite institutions. Next, we investigate whether gender and geography are significant 
determinants of attending a Top 5 IIT. Figure 2 shows the share of test takers attending a Top 5 
IIT by rank and gender (in 200-person bins). We can see that for the top 800-ranked test takers, 
while all women choose to attend a Top 5, and a small share of men do not attend a Top 5 in this 
part of the distribution, there do not seem to be large gender differences in the expected direction 
of women being less likely to attend a Top 5. After 1,000, the share attending a Top 5 falls, and 
there are no clear patterns in differences by gender. We note that Figure 2 also shows clearly that 
at the top of the distribution, almost all test takers go to an IIT, which means that in this sample, 
almost no one is going to study in the U.S. instead of attending an IIT.15  
In Table 2, we estimate the determinants of attending a Top 5 IIT. In column 1, we see that 
scoring higher on the JEE is significantly associated with attending a Top 5, which is expected as 
the sole criterion for admission to an IIT is score on the JEE.  In column 2, we see that there is a 
                                                            
15 This is consistent with accounts that it is highly competitive for the very top to go to an IIT and those with lower 
scores might go to the U.S. instead (Najar, 2011).

negative relationship between being from a state with a Top 5 IIT located in it and attending a Top 
5 IIT.16 As evident in Figure A1 showing the location of the IITs, the Top 5 are indeed in ‘all 
corners’ of India, so geography may not play the driving force it might in other settings. In Column 
3, we interact gender and state with a Top 5 IIT and find no significant gender differences in the 
role of geography. While we cannot account for the role of unobserved factors playing a role in 
attending a Top 5 IIT, this analysis suggests that scores are indeed the biggest determinant of 
attending a Top 5. We will explore the robustness of our main results to concerns about geography 
further in the next section. 
(Insert Table 2 About Here) 
 
6. Association of IIT Attendance with Migration, Conditional on Test Scores 
 
Now we turn to our analysis of the relationship between attending a Top 5 IIT and 
subsequent migration. In Table 3, we present regression results for attending a Top 5 IIT and 
migration based on our main sample of 2,470 top scorers who had scores high enough to enter at 
least one track in a Top 5 IIT. As discussed in the empirical strategy section, we hold ability/prior 
human capital and the choice set constant by controlling for the number of points scored through 
fixed effects. Column 1 shows that attending a Top 5 IIT is associated with a 4.2 percentage point 
increase in the likelihood of migration. When we consider migration for graduate school 
specifically (column 2), we see that attending a Top 5 IIT is associated with a 4.9 percentage point 
increase in the propensity to migrate for graduate school and a 5.4 percentage point increase in the 
propensity to migrate for Ph.D. studies. Relative to the propensity among those not attending a 
Top 5 IIT (4.2%), this implies that going to a Top 5 IIT is associated with a higher likelihood of 
migrating for graduate school of over 100%. When we further separate migration for graduate 
school into migrating for a Ph.D. vs. a Master’s, most of the increase in the likelihood of migrating 
                                                            
16 While this may seem surprising, we note that because the Top 5 IITs are located in or nearby major population 
centers, students from a state with a Top 5 IIT may also have more attractive alternative education options nearby. 
For instance, students from the capital territory of Delhi are close to IIT Delhi (a Top 5 IIT) but also to IIT Roorkee 
(200 km away from Delhi). Because popular majors have lower entry requirements outside the Top 5 IITs, students 
may eschew more prestigious (and possibly closer) institutions for a more desirable major at a lower ranked 
institution. 

13 
 
is for Ph.D. programs (almost 18 percentage points). Meanwhile, we see no significant effect for 
the likelihood of migrating for work (as opposed to for graduate school). 
 
As discussed earlier, a key concern with the regressions in Table 3 is endogenous 
enrollment decisions. One way that endogenous enrollment can impact the estimates is if among 
two equally scoring individuals, one who has more family responsibilities or who has a strong 
attachment to the home region chooses to stay close to home and not attend a Top 5IIT.  This 
would be a problem for our main estimates as these individuals would also be less likely to move 
abroad, biasing our estimates for attending a Top 5 on migration upwards.   
 To probe the extent to which our results from the main specification may be driven by 
individuals who are geographically bound to their home location, we run the regressions from 
above, excluding individuals who study close to home.17 First, we note that the share of students 
studying close to home is small: 86% of students study outside their home states and 82% study 
more than 200 km away. In Table 4, Panel A, where we exclude those who study in the same state, 
the results are quite similar across all outcomes to the main specification. In Table 4, Panel B, 
where we exclude those who study more than 200 km away, only the main effect of migrating for 
a Ph.D. holds, but the point estimates for the other outcomes are similar. Overall, this evidence 
provides some reassurance that the results are not driven by pre-existing (and persistent) 
geographical mobility constraints. 
A separate concern relates to the fact that we impute migration status to non-migrant for 
individuals in our sample who have missing career histories (11 percent of the sample). In 
Appendix Table A4, we report the result of a sensitivity exercise where we assume instead that all 
individuals with missing career histories are migrants. The results are similar to those of the main 
specification despite the very conservative assumption, possibly due to the fact that having a 
missing career history is not correlated with attending a Top 5 IIT (controlling for score). 
6. Potential Mechanisms 
6a. Human Capital: Choice of Major 
                                                            
17 To code distance, we exploit the fact that we can observe in which testing centers (out of 300+) individuals took 
the JEE test. Taking the testing center as a proxy for home location, we compute the distance between the home 
location and the college attended. 

14 
 
One potential explanation for the estimates in Table 3 is differences in the human capital 
obtained by those attending Top 5 IITs. One way human capital can differ is if the quality of 
education differs across Top 5 IITs and other institutions attended by individuals in our sample. 
While we cannot directly test for differences in the quality of education, the Top 5 IITs and other 
IITs and non-IIT engineering colleges are known to provide high-quality instruction. Another way 
human capital could differ is if those who attend a Top 5 IIT pursue different courses of study or 
majors. As discussed in section 2, admission to a particular IIT is course-specific, so individuals 
are choosing an institution and a course of study simultaneously. Individuals in our sample 
commonly face a choice between pursuing a more popular major (such as computer science) 
outside a Top 5 engineering college or a less popular major in a Top 5 IIT. 
We indeed find that those who attend a Top 5 IIT pursue different majors than individuals 
not attending an IIT. In Appendix Table A5, we show that controlling for the total score, those 
who attend a Top 5 IIT are less likely to complete a computer science, electrical engineering, or 
mechanical engineering major. However, once we control for major area of study in our main 
regression estimating the impact of Top 5 IIT on migration (shown in Table 5), we find similar 
results as in Table 2. This suggests that human capital differences in terms of major area of study 
are likely not playing a large role in the differences in migration probabilities. Appendix Table A6 
also shows interactions of Top 5 and different majors on our main outcomes. There do not seem 
to be clear differences in the role of a Top 5 by major. Further, course selectivity does not appear 
to be correlated with migration when controlling for Top 5 IIT attendance (shown in Appendix 
Table A7) 
6b. Signaling: The BHU Name Change 
Next, we examine whether the IIT ‘brand’ may play a signaling role that facilitates 
migration. Distinguishing the signaling value of the IIT brand from other features of an IIT 
education is challenging. However, we are able to leverage an interesting situation whereby one 
university received IIT designation without any concomitant changes to its staff, curriculum, or 
admission system, similar to the approach used by studies of the signaling value of university 
names (Acton, 2022) or degrees (Tyler, Murnane, and Willett, 2000) net of human capital effects. 
We note that similar to Acton (2022), the signaling value of the IIT brand here does not imply 

15 
 
signaling on students’ innate ability, but rather that the IIT diploma may provide a signal of the 
quality of the human capital gained in an IIT to graduate schools or employers after graduation. 
Institute of Technology at Banaras Hindu University, a respected engineering college 
tracing its roots to the early 20th century, became the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) 
Varanasi in 2012.18 The timing of the change was difficult to anticipate: the IIT Council initially 
proposed converting IT-BHU into an IIT campus as early as 1971, but political considerations led 
the proposal to be shelved for many years until it took effect in 2012.19 While the name officially 
became IIT BHU on June 21, 2012, it took time for the name to be used practically.  For example, 
the website only went live in late September 2012.20 
Using a purpose-built ancillary dataset, we compare the migration rate of the BHU students 
graduating before and after it received the IIT designation. Note that the cohorts of students 
enrolled at BHU at the time of the change had made their decision to study at BHU without 
knowing when BHU might become an IIT. Since we are comparing migration rates across different 
cohorts, we define our outcome of interest to be migration within five years of graduation in order 
to avoid truncation issues.  
The data for the BHU students was collected from the IIT BHU Alumni website and 
LinkedIn.21 The sample of 1,956 BHU students includes all students who graduated from BHU 
between 2005-2015 with a B.Tech, B.Pharm, M.Tech, or IDD degree.22 In case of ambiguity in 
matching student names across the Alumni website dataset and LinkedIn, the team of RAs used 
information on the department of study at BHU and graduation year to determine the match. 
                                                            
18 The institution was founded in 1919, as Banaras Engineering College (BENCO). 
19 IIT (BHU) Varanasi is one of three IIT locations that were converted from existing institutions. In August 2010, 
Minister of State for Human Resource Development D. Purandeswari introduced a bill formalizing the conversion, by 
amending the 1961 Institutes of Technology Act. The amendment passed the Lok Sabha (lower house of Indian 
parliament) in March 2011  and the Raiya Sabha (upper house of Indian parliament) in April 2012.  It was signed into 
law by the President of India in June 2012.  
20 From the Way Back Machine the posting of the new website in September 2012 is evident: 
https://web.archive.org/web/20120915000000*/https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/ 
21 IIT BHU Alumni website can be accessed at: https://connect.iitbhuglobal.org/members.dz# 
22 Including the following streams of study: Biochemical Engineering, Ceramic Engineering, Chemical Engineering, 
Civil Engineering, Computer Science Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, Mechanical 
Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Mining Engineering, Pharmaceutical Engineering, Material Science & 
Technology, Biomedical Engineering, Industrial Management, Power Electronics, Systems Engineering, and Power 
Systems.

Figure 3 shows the share of students migrating (for graduate school) by year of graduation 
from 2005 to 2015. There is a slow secular increase in migration throughout the period (as shown 
through the linear trend). There is also a clear increase in the share migrating for graduate school 
for those who graduated in 2014 and 2015 after BHU became an IIT. Table 6 shows the regression 
estimates comparing the migration probability of students graduating in 2013‒2015 vs. earlier 
years before the change to an IIT. This shows that controlling for a linear time trend, the 
designation of BHU as an IIT led to a 5.4 percentage point increase in the probability of migration 
for graduate school. Compared to a baseline propensity of 10.5 percent prior to IIT designation, 
our estimates correspond to a roughly 50 percent increase in the propensity to migrate for graduate 
school. While sizeable, this effect size is noticeably smaller than in the main specification of 
section 5. The difference could be due to Top 5 IITs providing a stronger signal, to the main 
specification estimates, or both.  
 
One limitation of the preceding results is that they are based on time effects within BHU 
graduates. To provide some reassurance on the validity of the analysis, we also compare BHU 
graduates to graduates from two other engineering colleges that did not gain IIT designation in a 
simple difference-in-differences setting (shown in Appendix Table A8). The point estimate for the 
diff-in-diff coefficient is positive and significant, and larger in magnitude than in the main 
exercise. However, the diff-in-diff results are also noisy due to shorter time coverage and the 
relatively small number of students in the control institutes.  
Taken as a whole, the results from this subsection suggest that the IIT brand by itself 
facilitates migration and that signaling may play a role in the greater incidence of migration among 
IIT graduates. 
6c. Role of Alumni Networks 
Lastly, we examine whether alumni networks can facilitate migration.  Alumni networks 
can lower the costs of migration for IIT students by providing information about educational and 
employment opportunities. Alumni may also facilitate access to particular programs where they 
have influence over admissions or hiring decisions. 
To examine the role of networks, we consider the case of computer science graduate 
programs in the U.S., where we are able to precisely observe the composition and, importantly, 

17 
 
the undergraduate education of faculty members, thanks to a community data collection effort 
(Papoutsaki, et al., 2015). The computer science faculty data cover around 2,400 faculty members 
in 55 top U.S. graduate programs. Remarkably, 134 (5.6%) of these faculty members are alumni 
of one of the IITs. The distribution of these IIT alumni is uneven, with 12 programs having no IIT 
alumni at all and MIT and the University of Illinois each having as many as eight. 
We next combine the faculty data with information on which universities IIT graduates in 
our sample attended for their U.S. graduate studies. We focus here on the 39 individuals in our 
sample who enrolled in a U.S. graduate program in computer science and the top 25 graduate 
programs in the U.S. News of the World ranking.23 For each individual, we consider the 25 
potential destinations and estimate a multinomial logit model of the type: 
log 𝑝𝑝൫𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝑘𝑘൯
𝑝𝑝൫𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝐾𝐾൯= 𝛼𝛼+ 𝛽𝛽1𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝛽𝛽2𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝛽𝛽3𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖+ 𝜀𝜀 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 
where i indexes individuals, j indexes the IIT they are graduating from with an 
undergraduate degree, k indexes U.S. Ph.D. programs, and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 is the score the individual 
obtained on the IIT Joint Entrance Exam. Our dependent variable is the log odds of enrolling in a 
particular program k.  Our variables of interest are (1) 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖—the number of faculty 
members in the U.S. program who are alumni of the IIT attended by the student—and (2) 
𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖—the number of faculty members in the U.S. program who are alumni of 
other IITs. To illustrate, the computer science department at MIT has five alumni from IIT Madras 
among its faculty members, as well as one alumnus from IIT Bombay, one from IIT Delhi, and 
one from IIT Kanpur. A student from IIT Madras considering MIT would have a value of five for 
𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and a value of three for 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼_𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖.   
Table 7 reports the results of the multinomial logistic model as relative risk ratios. An 
additional alumnus from one’s own IIT in a particular destination is associated with a 30% increase 
in the likelihood of enrolling in that destination. By contrast, the number of IIT alumni from other 
IITs does not appear to correlate with the decision to enroll in a program: the point estimate of the 
                                                            
23 We are considering this particular—admittedly small—slice of our sample because we know the faculty 
composition of various U.S. departments in computer science, but not in other disciplines. We observe only a 
handful of IIT graduates enrolling in computer science program outside the top 25.  

18 
 
relative risk ratio is not just insignificant, but is also very close to one. Overall, the results suggest 
that alumni networks may facilitate access to particular U.S. graduate programs. 
7. Conclusion 
Using a novel dataset of students taking the JEE exam and their education and career 
outcomes, we have documented that the incidence of migration among top talent is sizeable, and 
particularly so at the very right tail of the talent distribution. Among the top 1,000 scorers at the 
JEE (corresponding to 0.2% of the test takers and 0.00005% of the birth cohort), the share of 
migrants is around 36%, rising to 62% among the top 100 scorers, and to 9 out of the top 10 scorers. 
While prior literature has documented that the incidence of migration rises with educational 
attainment (Saint-Paul, 2004; Docquier and Marfouk, 2006; Docquier and Rapoport, 2012; 
Grogger and Hanson, 2011; Kerr, et al., 2016), our work reveals that this masks considerable 
heterogeneity among the tertiary-educated in the ability dimension. Indeed, the incidence of 
migration rises dramatically among the most extraordinarily able, as conjectured by Saint-Paul 
(2004). 
We have also documented that graduates of the most elite IITs are more likely to migrate 
abroad after graduating compared to equally talented individuals who chose other IITs.  Prior 
research has documented the large enrollment of Indian students in U.S. graduate programs 
(Bound, et al., 2021). We show that Indian educational institutions are playing an important role 
in facilitating this enrollment, as Top 5 IIT graduates are more likely to migrate for graduate school 
than others, and to migrate to the U.S. to attend Ph.D. programs, in particular. We find that this is 
likely due to the signaling value of the IIT brand, as well as to the networks that are formed among 
alumni of specific IIT campuses. In fact, these networks likely play an even larger role than our 
analysis of computer science faculty alumni networks suggests.    
While prior work has emphasized the gatekeeping role of elite universities in host countries 
(Kerr, et al., 2016, Amornsiripanitch, et al., 2021), our paper surfaces the similar role played by 
elite universities in source countries. While we cannot observe the full extent of the mechanisms 
contributing to these effects, our analysis suggests that through a combination of signaling and 
network effects, elite universities in source countries play a key role in shaping migration 
outcomes, both in terms of the overall propensity and the particular migration destination. We note 

19 
 
that the fact that elite home universities act as gatekeepers for migration further raises the stakes 
of their own admission policies. 
We conclude by mentioning two lines of inquiry that could be explored in future research. 
The first is why the incidence of migration rises dramatically at the very right tail of the talent 
distribution (above and beyond the gatekeeping role of universities). One potential explanation is 
that the private return to extraordinary ability is higher in destination countries (perhaps due to 
agglomeration effects) than in source countries. This raises the question of whether home countries 
should make special efforts to retain their top talent. It will be interesting to study whether patterns 
of migration at the right tail of the talent distribution change based on increased access to 
entrepreneurial opportunities in the home country,24 adoption of remote work, or other 
contemporary changes. The second avenue to explore is whether alternative arrangements to the 
current dominant skilled migration model (with elite universities in home and host countries acting 
as gatekeepers) would be preferable from the point of view of the source country, destination 
country, or the immigrants themselves. For instance, analysis could examine the impacts of the 
United Kingdom’s new “High Potential Individual” visa route, open to graduates from the top 50 
global universities, to attract global talent.25 Other scenarios to examine in further research include 
whether IIT graduates could be hired by U.S. companies straight out of their undergraduate 
programs (instead of obtaining graduate degrees in the U.S.) or whether U.S. universities should 
formally use JEE scores in their undergraduate admission decisions or give scholarships to attract 
top talent to their institutions. 
 
 
                                                            
24 An example of such increased access to entrepreneurship opportunities relates to the relatively recent founding of 
research parks at some of the IITs. See: https://respark.iitm.ac.in/. 
25 As of 2022, however, this list did not include any IITs, or indeed any Indian university.

Figure 3. Share of BHU Graduates Migrating Before and After BHU Acquired IIT 
Designation  
 
Notes: The Figure displays the share of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) graduates migrating within five 
years of graduation, by year of graduation. In June 2012, the Institute of Technology at BHU became Indian 
Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, without concomitant changes to its staffing or curriculum. The 
first cohort potentially affected would be the one graduating in 2013. Individuals graduating in 2014 
(respectively 2015) would have enrolled in 2010 (respectively 2011), when it was not known if/when BHU 
would become an IIT (discussions about designating BHU as an IIT had been ongoing since the 1970s). 
Superimposed is a linear fit based on the years 2005‒2013.

Notes: Admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology is exclusively through the Joint Entrance Exam 
(JEE). Our data leverages the unanticipated public release of the 2010 JEE data combined with an intensive 
data collection effort on migration outcomes conducted by a dedicated team. Our dependent variable is 
whether the individual migrated from India (column 1), whether the individual migrated from India to 
attend graduate school (Master’s or Ph.D., column 2), whether the individual migrated from India to attend 
graduate school for a Master’s degree (column 4), whether the individual migrated from India to attend 
graduate school for a Ph.D. degree (column 5) or whether the individual migrated from India for work 
(column 3). The sample includes the 2,470 top scorers in the general category (scores 243 and above, 
corresponding to an All India Rank below 3,000). Estimation is by OLS. We control for JEE score fixed 
effects (and hence ability/prior human capital, as well as the choice set faced by individuals). Robust 
standard errors in parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01

Notes: Individuals who forego studying at a Top 5 IIT may do so to stay closer to family (say to take care 
of an ailing parent or younger sibling) or because they have a strong attachment to their home region. This, 
in turn, could lead to lower migration propensities. This table investigates the robustness of our results to 
excluding individuals who study close to home and may thus be “geographically bound.” Panel A replicates 
Table 3, panel B is run on the subsample of individuals who study outside their home state, and panel C is 
run on the subsample of individuals who study outside a 200 km radius from the location where they took 
the JEE test. All specifications include JEE score fixed effects and gender. Robust standard errors in 
parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01

Notes: This Table analyzes migration propensities among (BHU) graduates. In June 2012, the Institute of 
Technology at BHU became Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, without concomitant changes 
to its staffing or curriculum. The first cohort potentially affected would be the one graduating in 2013. 
Individuals graduating in 2013 (respectively 2014, 2015) would have enrolled in 2009 (respectively 2010, 
2011), when it was not known if/when BHU would become an IIT (discussions about designating BHU as 
an IIT had been ongoing since the 1970s). The sample includes BHU graduates from 2005 to 2015 and we 
consider cohorts graduating in 2013, 2014, and 2015 as treated by IIT designation. The dependent variables 
are migrating out of India within five years of BHU graduation (column 1 and 2) or migrating out of Indian 
for graduate school within five years of BHU graduation (column 3 and 4). Columns 2 and 4 control for a 
linear time trend in the year of graduation. Estimation is OLS. Both specifications include major fixed 
effects. Robust standard errors in parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01

Notes: For this analysis, we focus on computer science, where we are able to observe precisely the faculty 
composition of U.S. graduate programs. Our sample is based on the 39 individuals in our sample who 
enrolled in a U.S. Ph.D. program in computer science, and the top 25 computer graduate programs in the 
U.S. News of the World ranking as potential destinations. Our variables of interest are (1) the number of 
faculty members in the U.S. program who are alumni of the IIT attended by the student, and (2) the number 
of faculty members in the U.S. program who are alumni of other IITs. We estimate a multinomial logit 
choice model and report relative risk ratios. Standard errors in parentheses.

Notes: As discussed in the main text, career histories could not be traced for around 11% of 
individuals in the sample. We generally assume these individuals have not migrated. In this 
robustness table, we reproduce Table 3 assuming these individuals did migrate (in terms of type of 
migration—migrating for work/graduate school/Ph.D./Master’s—we assume each type occurs in 
the same proportion as in the observed migration episodes). Note that share of observation with 
missing career histories is similar across those who attended a Top 5 or not. Robust standard errors 
in parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01

Notes: This Table investigates whether attending a Top 5 IIT is more or less strongly associated with migration, 
depending on the major of study. The main effect of aerospace drops out due to there being (in our sample) no one 
studying aerospace outside the Top 5 IITs. Robust Standard errors in parentheses.+ p < 0.10,* p < 0.05,** p < 0.01

Notes: This Table analyzes migration propensities among graduates from three well-respected Indian 
engineering colleges: a) The Institute of Technology at BHU b) Motilal Nehru National Institute of 
Technology and c) National Institute of Technology Karnataka. In June 2012, The Institute of Technology 
at BHU became Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi, without concomitant changes to its staffing 
or curriculum. The other two institutes did not gain IIT designation in this period and are used as controls. 
The sample goes from 2009 to 2015 (as opposed to 2005 to 2015 in Table 6 due to limited data availability 
for the two control institutes). Our variable of interest is a dummy taking value one for BHU graduates 
graduating after 2013, and we control for cohort fixed effects and the main effect attending BHU. Robust 
standard errors in parentheses. + p < 0.10, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01
