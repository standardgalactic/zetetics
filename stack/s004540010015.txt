Abstract.
We consider rotations A, B of ﬁnite order in SO(3), about axes separated by
an angle of restricted type, and attempt to classify the possible group relations between A
and B. We show that the relations responsible for the symmetries of Platonic solids have
consequences far beyond that simple geometric setting.
1.
Introduction and Results
In two recent papers [1], [3] we classiﬁed certain subgroups of SO(3), namely, those
generated by two rotations, of order p and q, respectively, about perpendicular axes.
Presentations were given for these groups, and an interesting feature emerged: for all
these groups the only relators needed were based on symmetries of the cube.
In [4] we generalized these results to pairs of rotations of ﬁnite order whose axes are
separated by an angle α which is a rational multiple of π—in other words, for which
e2iα is a root of unity. Again the only relators needed were based on symmetries of the
cube, and, in particular, there are never any relations between generators of odd order.
This is surprising, since the group of rotational symmetries of the tetrahedron is
generated by two rotations of order 3. Moreover, the group of rotational symmetries
of the icosahedron (or dodecahedron) may be generated in several distinct ways by
two rotations of odd order: either two rotations of order 3, two of order 5, or one

of order 3 and one of order 5. In each of these cases the angle α between the axes
of rotation is not, of course, a rational multiple of π. Instead, α is in many cases
an angle whose squared trigonometric functions are rational. This means that e2iα is
algebraically simple in a different way. Instead of treating e2iα = eiπ as a (square)
root of unity, we can think of it as satisfying a quadratic polynomial with integer
coefﬁcients.
Angles whose squared trigonometric functions are rational are called “geodetic” and
were introduced in [2]. If an angle α is geodetic, then x = exp(2iα) is at worst a quadratic
irrational, since x + x−1 + 2 = 4 cos2(θ) is rational. Geodetic angles are denoted by the
squares of their sines: ∠(a/c) denotes sin−1(√a/c).
In [2] we found all additive relations between geodetic angles. Equivalently, we
classiﬁed all relations between rotations in the plane by geodetic angles. In this paper we
extend this analysis to three dimensions, analyzing relations between rotations of ﬁnite
order about axes that are separated by geodetic angles, as in Platonic solids.
A basic feature of our method is to employ only those relators coming from Pla-
tonic symmetry groups. In a sense the main result we report is that although this is
not sufﬁcient for all these groups, it does go surprisingly far. With only a few excep-
tions, the relations that can occur are direct consequences of symmetries of Platonic
solids.
Given a geodetic angle ∠(a/c), where a and c are relatively prime positive integers
with a < c, we let A = R2π/p
x
be a rotation about the x axis by angle 2π/p and let
B = R2π/q
ℓ
be a rotation about the ℓaxis by 2π/q, where the ℓaxis is in the x–y plane,
itself making an angle of ∠(a/c) with the x axis.
Theorem 1.
The following conditions are necessary for there to be nontrivial relations
between A and B:
H1. c is not divisible by any prime greater than 5.
H2. c is not divisible by 23, 33, or 52.
H3. If c is even, then both p and q are even.
H4. If c is divisible by 3, then p or q is divisible by 3.
H5. If c is divisible by 32, then both p and q are divisible by 3.
H6. If c is divisible by 5, then both p and q are divisible by 5.
H7. If p and q are both odd, then a is divisible by 4.
Corollary.
There is only a ﬁnite set of geodetic angles ∠(a/c) that can support non-
trivial relations between ﬁnite-order rotations A and B about axes separated by ∠(a/c).
These angles have c ∈{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180}.
It is a daunting task to understanding which of the geodetic angles of the corollary
actually do support relations for which values of p and q, and to understand what the
relationsactuallyare.However,when p andq areofprimeorder,acompleteclassiﬁcation
is possible:
Theorem 2 (The Primordial Theorem).
Assume p and q are prime and that the group
generated by A and B is not the free product of the obvious cyclic groups. The following

examples occur, and are the only ones possible:
(i)
α = ∠1
1, p = 2 and/or q = 2;
(ii)
α = ∠8
9, p = q = 3;
(iii)
α = ∠4
5, p = q = 5;
(iv)
α = ∠3
4, p = q = 2;
(v)
α = ∠2
3, {p, q} = {2, 3};
(vi)
α = ∠1
2, p = q = 2;
(vii)
α = ∠4
9, p = q = 3;
(viii)
α = ∠1
3, {p, q} = {2, 3};
(ix)
α = ∠1
4, p = q = 2.
Furthermore, the relations derive straightforwardly from those exhibited in Platonic
solids.
The assumption of prime order in Theorem 2 is essential. Allowing composite orders
we have the additional
Example.
If c = 6, a = 5, p = 6, and q = 2, then
A2B A3B A2B A4B A3B A4B
is the identity. (This follows from the “accidental” fact that A2B A3B A2 commutes
with B.)

We will consistently use the last expression for ˆBk. Notice that the expressions (10) for
ˆAk and ˆBk involve rational integers, roots of unity, and the square roots of b and c. These
are all elements of the cyclotomic ring of integers Z[ζN], where ζN is a primitive Nth
root of unity and N is any common multiple of 8, b, c, p, and q. We therefore do all our
analysis in this ring.

Some Algebraic Facts about Cyclotomic Rings of Integers
Lemma 1.
Let pn(z) be the minimal polynomial for a primitive nth root of unity, n ≥2.
Then
pn(1) =
½P,
if n is a power of a rational prime P;
1,
otherwise.
(11)
Proof.
If n is a prime, then pn(z) = 1+ z +· · ·+ zn−1 so pn(1) = n. If n is composite,
then pn(z) = (1 + z + · · · + zn−1)/5pm(z), where 1 < m < n and m ranges over the
factors of n. The two formulas for pn(1) when n is composite then follow by induction
on the number of factors of n.
Lemma 2.
If z and z′ are both primitive nth roots of unity, then z −1 and z′ −1 divide
one another in Z[ζN], for any multiple N of n.
Proof.
Since z and z′ are both primitive nth roots of unity, there exist integers r and s
such that z′ = zr and z = z′s. However, then z′ −1 = (z −1)(1 + z + · · · + zr−1) and
z −1 = (z′ −1)(1 + z′ + · · · + z′s−1).

458
J. H. Conway, C. Radin, and L. Sadun
Lemma 3.
Let n|N and let ζn be a primitive nth root of unity. If n has distinct prime
factors, then ζn −1 is a unit in the ring Z[ζN]. If n = Pk, P a rational prime, then
[ζn −1]Pk−Pk−1 = P×(unit).
Proof.
pn(1) = 5j(1 −vj) = ±5j(vj −1), where vj ranges over all the primitive nth
roots of unity. If n has distinct prime factors, then pn(1) = 1 and ζn −1, which divides
pn(1), is a unit. If n = Pk, by Lemma 2 and induction each of the Pk −Pk−1 terms
in the product 5j(1 −vj) are equal, up to multiplication by a unit, so P = pn(1) =
(ζn −1)Pk−Pk−1× unit.
For each rational prime P which divides N choose the largest power k such that Pk
divides N. ζPk −1 is irreducible in Z[ζN], so for each element x ∈Z[ζN] we associate a
unique power of P as follows. Let y be the largest rational integer such that (ζPk −1)y
divides x and associate to x the power y/(Pk −Pk−1) of P, sometimes described by
saying x is divisible by y/(Pk −Pk−1) powers of P.
4.
Proof of Theorem 1
We are now ready for the proof of Theorem 1. We show that if any of the conditions
H1–H7 is not met it is impossible for a product ˆτ = ˆA1 ˆB1 · · · ˆAn ˆBn to be a multiple
of the identity. The strategy is the same for each condition: assuming the condition is
violated, we ﬁnd a rational prime P such that the matrix element ˆτ22 is divisible by fewer
powers of P than is ˆτ11, so ˆτ22 ̸= ˆτ11, so ˆτ is not a multiple of the identity, and neither
is τ. In particular, we show that the term
( ˆA1)21( ˆB1)12 · · · ( ˆAn)21( ˆBn)12 = (
√
b + √c)n 5n
k=1(vk −1)(wk −1)
(12)
in the expansion of ˆτ22 is divisible by fewer powers of P than any other term, and fewer
than any term in the expansion of ˆτ11. The point is that all other terms in the expansion of
ˆτ22, and all terms in the expansion of ˆτ11, take the same form as (12) but with pairs of off-
diagonal matrix elements replaced by diagonal matrix elements. Each such replacement
exchanges a factor of (
√
b + √c)(vk −1)(wl −1) for 2√c times a unit (either vk or wl).
So to prove the theorem we need only show that if any of the conditions is violated,
then 2√c is divisible by more powers of P than is (
√
b +√c)(vk −1)(wl −1), for every
possible vk and wl. In other words, the comparison is always
(
√
b + √c)(vk −1)(wl −1)
versus
2√c.
(13)
Suppose that c is divisible by a rational prime P. Since a and c are relatively prime
in Z, the Euclidean algorithm shows that a is not divisible by any powers of P. Then
(√c −
√
b)(√c +
√
b) = c −b = a implies the same for (√c +
√
b). If p (or q) is
divisible by P, then vk −1 (or wl −1) has at most 1/(P −1) powers of P, while if p
(or q) is not divisible by P, then vk −1 (or wl −1) has no powers of P.
If P > 5, then the left-hand side of (13) has at most 2/(P −1) < 1
2 powers of P,
while the right hand has at least half a power of P (since P|c), and there cannot be a
relation. This establishes condition H1.

Relations in SO(3) Supported by Geodetic Angles
459
If P ≤5 there is still a limit to the number of powers of P on the left-hand side of
(13). If the right-hand side exceeds this number, then there can be no relation. If P = 5
there is at most half a power of 5 on the left-hand side, but if 52 divides c there is at least
one power of P on the right. If P = 3 there is at most one power of 3 on the left, but
if 33 divides c there are at least one and a half powers on the right. If P = 2 there are
at most two powers of 2 on the left, but if 23 divides c there are at least two and a half
powers on the right. This establishes H2.
If c is even, then there are at least one and a half powers of 2 on the right. However,
if either p or q is odd, then there can only be one power of 2 on the left. This establishes
H3.
If c is divisible by 3, then the right has at least half a power of 3, and we need either
p or q divisible by 3 to obtain half a power of 3 on the left. If c is divisible by 32, then
the right is divisible by 3, and we need both p and q divisible by 3 to obtain one power
of 3 on the left. This establishes H4 and H5.
If c is divisible by 5, then the right has at least half a power of 5. Since vk −1 and
wl −1 each have at most a quarter of a power of 5, to get half a power of 5 on the left
requires both p and q to be divisible by 5. This establishes H6.
Finally, suppose p and q are odd, so that vk −1 and wl −1 are not divisible by
any powers of 2. The right-hand side has an explicit power of 2 (regardless of c), so
to obtain relations we must have (√c +
√
b) divisible by 2. However, in that case
√c −
√
b = √c +

b −2
√
b is also divisible by 2, so a = (√c +

b)(√c −

b) must

Platonic Relations and the Angle-Dividing Trick
Let Gα(p, q) be the subgroup of SO(3) generated by rotations A and B of order p
and q, respectively, about axes separated by an angle α. We say an angle α supports
relations if, for some integers p and q, the group Gα(p, q) is not the free product of
the obvious Zp and Zq subgroups. The corollary to Theorem 1 says that only a ﬁnite
number of geodetic angles support relations. In this section we consider the angles
that do.
We begin with the Platonic relations known since antiquity. The symmetry group of
each Platonic solid is ﬁnite (and in particular not free), so the angle between any two
axes of symmetry must support relations.
The tetrahedron has an axis of threefold symmetry (a triad) through each vertex,
passing through the middle of the opposite face. It also has axes of twofold symmetry
(dyads) passing from the middle of each edge through the middle of the opposite edge.
The triad axes make angles of ∠8
9 with one another and ∠2
3 with the dyad axes. The dyad
axes are perpendicular to one another.
The cube has triad axes through each pair of opposite vertices, fourfold (quad) axes
through opposite faces and dyad axes through opposite edges. The angles ∠1
3, ∠2
3, ∠8
9,
∠3
4, and ∠1
2 appear as dyad-triad, quad-triad, triad-triad, dyad-dyad, and dyad-quad
angles, respectively. The angles ∠2
3 and ∠8
9 appear both in the tetrahedron and the cube.
This reﬂects the fact that one can embed a tetrahedron in a cube, making the tetrahedral
group a subgroup of the cube group.

460
J. H. Conway, C. Radin, and L. Sadun
In the icosahedron one ﬁnds the angles from the tetrahedron repeated once again, and
the additional angles ∠1
4, ∠4
5, and ∠4
9, corresponding to dyad-dyad, pentad-pentad and
triad-triad angles, respectively. The angles between other pairs of axes support relations,
of course, but are either not new or not geodetic, and so are not listed.
The angles appearing in Platonic solids form a short list, but from them we can
construct many angles that support relations, thanks to
Theorem 3 (The Angle-Dividing Trick).
Iftheangle α supportsrelations,thensodoes
α/n for every positive integer n.
Proof.
Suppose Gα(p′, q′) is not a free product and let β = α/n, n ≥2. Let p =
q = 2p′q′. We will show that Gβ(p, q) is not a free product of the obvious Zp and Zq
subgroups.
The group Gβ(p, q) contains rotations of order p about the x and ℓaxes. Since p = q
is even, it contains a rotation Bq/2 by π about the ℓaxis. Then C = Bq/2ABq/2 is a
rotation of order p about an axis ℓ′ making an angle 2β with the x axis. Conjugating
B by C p/2 gives a rotation D of order p about an axis ℓ′′ making an angle 3β with the
x axis. See Fig. 1. Continuing in this way we construct a rotation Z of order p about
an axis making an angle of nβ = α with the x axis. However, by assumption there are
relations between Z2p′ and A2q′, hence relations between A and B.
Note that, although the proof used p = q = 2p′q′, smaller values will typically
sufﬁce. In particular, if α supports relations between two rotations of order p′, then α/2
supports relations between a rotation of order p′ and a rotation of order 2. For example,
∠8
9 supports triad-triad relations, while ∠1
3 = 1
2∠8
9 supports a triad-dyad relation.
Fig. 1.

Relations in SO(3) Supported by Geodetic Angles

6.
Proof of Theorem 2
We know from Theorem 1 that, for ∠(a/c) to support relations, c must be of the form
2s3t5u, where 0 ≤s ≤2, 0 ≤t ≤2, 0 ≤u ≤1.
(a) If c = 1, then a = 1 and the axes are orthogonal. Since a is not divisible by 4,
either p or q is even (hence equal to 2) and the group in question is a ﬁnite dihedral
group. This can be viewed as coming from the cube group by the angle-dividing trick.
For the remainder we can assume c > 1.
(b) If u = 1, then p = q = 5, so c = 5 and a = 4. Angle ∠4
5 is indeed an angle
between two pentad axes of the icosahedron.
For the remainder we can assume u = 0.
(c) If s ̸= 0, then p = q = 2 and c = 2 or 4, giving ∠1
2 = π/4, ∠3
4 = π/3,
and ∠1
4 = π/6. The ﬁrst is a quad-dyad angle in the cube group, the second is a dyad-
dyad angle in the cube group, and the third is half the second, hence obtainable by the
angle-dividing trick.
For the remainder we can assume s = 0, so c = 3 or 9.
(d) If c = 3, then p or q = 3. If the other was odd, then a = 4 and we would have a
contradiction (a > c). So one of p, q is 3, the other is 2, and the two possible angles are
∠1
3 and ∠2
3. Each is a dyad-triad angle, the ﬁrst from the cube and the second from the
tetrahedron.
(e) If c = 9, then p = q = 3, so a = 4 or 8. Angle ∠4
9 is the angle between two
triad axes of the icosahedron, while ∠8
9 appears as the angle between two triad axes of
the tetrahedron (also of the cube and of the icosahedron).
7.
Which Angles Support Relations?
Theorems 1–3 largely determine which rational or geodetic angles can support relations.
All rational angles support relations, and the relations are simple: they derive from
the symmetries of the cube, extended by the angle-dividing trick. By contrast, only
a ﬁnite number of geodetic angles support relations. Some of these relations come
from symmetries of Platonic solids, while others (such as the example with ∠5
6) do not
appear to.
The question naturally arises of how to understand which angles in general can support
relations. We present here two results that illuminate the scope of the problem:
Theorem 4.
If the angle α supports nontrivial relations, then e2iα is algebraic.
Proof.
Let N = pq. Every element of the group Gα(p, q) can be built from the
rotations R2π/N
x
, Rα
z , and R−α
z , which we represent as
µζN + 1

(14)
respectively, where z = eiα. The matrix elements of any purported relator τ are therefore

462
J. H. Conway, C. Radin, and L. Sadun
polynomials in z with coefﬁcients in Z[ζN]. τ is a multiple of the identity if and only if
z satisﬁes the polynomial equations
τ11 −τ22 = τ12 = τ21 = 0.
(15)
If τ is a nontrivial relator, then τ11 −τ22, τ12, and τ21 cannot all be the zero polynomial,
as we know that there are some angles (e.g., ∠1
11) that do not satisfy (15). Thus z (and
therefore z2) is algebraic.
Although every angle that supports relations is algebraic, the relations themselves,
and thus the minimal polynomials, can be arbitrarily complicated:
Theorem 5.
Fix p and q, and let τ be an arbitrary (but ﬁxed) word in A and B,
rotations of order p and q, respectively, about axes separated by α. For a dense set of
angles α ∈[0, 2π], a power of τ is a relator.
Proof.
For any α, τ is a rotation by some angle θ about some axis. The angle θ depends
real analytically on α, and can be recovered from the trace of τ, represented as a matrix
in SO(3). Whenever θ is a rational multiple of π, a power of τ is a rotation by a multiple
of 2π, hence is the identity. If θ is not constant as α varies, the denseness of the α’s that
give rational θ’s follows from the denseness of the rational numbers and the analytic
dependence of θ on α. If θ is constant, it equals the value for α = 0, which is a multiple
of 2π/pq. In that case a power of τ is a relation for all α.

Conclusions
We have been discussing the group relations that exist between a pair of elements of
SO(3), more speciﬁcally, a pair of rotations of ﬁnite order about axes separated by
an angle α of restricted type. Our method for analyzing such group relations involves
algebraic relations of e2iα. In previous papers we solved all cases where e2iα is a root of
unity, and in this paper we consider the next simplest situation, where e2iα is a quadratic
irrational—a class with natural geometric signiﬁcance.
It is plausible that this effort could be extended to algebraic angles of higher order,
but Theorem 5 suggests that progressively higher orders will yield progressively more
complicated (and more difﬁcult) results. In principal it seems to us unlikely that an
understanding of such groups could be attained for arbitrary α, but that other reasonable
subclasses might be proﬁtably attempted.
