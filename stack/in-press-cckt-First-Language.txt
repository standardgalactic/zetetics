Abstract
The study by Kidd and Garcia is long overdue. Their analyses of published research on 
language acquisition highlight the lack of typological diversity in studies of how children 
acquire their native tongue. We concur with their conclusion that more research on 
understudied languages is urgently needed. However, we argue that what the field 
needs is not just wider cross-linguistic coverage but a systematic comparative approach 
to language acquisition – one in which investigations of well-studied languages still has 
much to contribute.

Special Issue: How diverse is child language acquisition research

First Language 00(0)
In their article, Kidd and Garcia (2022) note how the world’s more than 7,000 current 
languages provide a treasure trove of linguistic diversity that can yield new insights 
into how children acquire their native tongue. Yet, their analyses of published research 
in four key language acquisition journals over the past 45 years clearly demonstrate 
that most studies in this field focus on English and other closely related Indo-European 
languages. In our own analyses (Christiansen et al., 2022), we found a similar bias in 
a large-scale multi-lab replication study of infant-directed speech (The ManyBabies 
Consortium, 2020) as well as in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000), which 
supports much of the computational work on acquisition. Given the alarming rate of 
language loss, as noted by Kidd and Garcia, more research on the acquisition of under-
studied languages is crucial. Their study is thus a welcome call to arms for language 
acquisition researchers.
Although we agree that documenting the acquisition of endangered and moribund 
languages is of utmost importance, we believe that such studies would add the most sci-
entific value when conducted within a systematic comparative framework. That is, 
whereas the acquisition of individual languages so far has tended to be the norm in the 
field, we advocate for a comparative cross-linguistic approach to acquisition (see also 
Slobin & Bowerman, 2007). Specifically, we have proposed three levels of cross-linguis-
tic comparisons (Christiansen et  al., 2022): coarse-grained comparisons between the 
acquisition of unrelated languages to evaluate broad universalist claims, fine-grained 
comparisons between genetically and/or typologically related languages to assess the 
effect of specific factors on learning, and within-language comparisons to investigate 
how socio-communicative factors affect acquisition.
Coarse-grained comparisons between the acquisition of very different languages are 
fundamental to evaluating broad theoretical claims by uncovering commonalities (to 
establish general tendencies) or substantial qualitative differences (to dispute universal-
ist generalizations). Here, the inclusion of understudied languages is vital, as noted by 
Kidd and Garcia (2022). They discuss several important examples of such comparisons, 
including variations in children’s linguistic environment and its impact on acquisition 
(e.g. Casillas et al., 2020; see Christiansen & Chater, 2022, for a discussion). Of the few 
previous studies that have conducted cross-linguistic comparisons of language acquisi-
tion, most have done so at this coarse-grained level of contrast (e.g. Bates et al., 1984; 
Chouinard & Clark, 2003).
Melissa Bowerman (personal communication, as cited in Plunkett & Strömqvist, 
1992) pointed to a second level of systematic cross-linguistic comparison between 
typologically related languages to reveal how specific linguistic differences might 
affect acquisition. This kind of fine-grained comparisons can usefully be made 
between genetically and/or typologically related languages, whether they are under-
studied or not. In our own work on the Puzzle of Danish project, for example, we 
studied the learning and processing of Danish relative to its genetically and typologi-
cally similar neighboring languages – Norwegian and Swedish. We found that a 
higher degree of phonetic reduction in Danish, compared with the two neighbor lan-
guages, leads to the delayed acquisition of vocabulary and morphology (Trecca et al., 
2021). Fine-grained comparisons have also been made between less studied lan-
guages, such as the investigation by Pye and Pfeiler (2014) of differences in

children’s use of suffixes when acquiring two closely related Mayan languages, 
K’iche’ and Yucatec. Future fine-grained contrasts may also yield insights into the 
effects of cultural and societal differences on language acquisition, for example, by 
comparing the acquisition of variants of the same language spoken in different coun-
tries (such as Chilean Spanish vs. Peninsular Spanish) to provide evidence about 
language-external influences on learning.
Whereas a few other researchers have similarly called for a more comparative 
approach to language acquisition (see, for example, Plunkett & Strömqvist, 1992; Pye 
& Pfeiler, 2014; Slobin & Bowerman, 2007), we are the first to propose a multi-
pronged comparative approach that also includes within-language comparisons 
(Christiansen et  al., 2022). Given that language is inherently social (e.g. Beckner 
et al., 2009), it is important to study the influences of variations in social factors on 
language. To help isolate the impact of such factors, this is best done as a within-
language comparison, contrasting language acquisition by children living in the same 
country but in different socio-communicative settings. This kind of investigation has 
primarily been conducted in Western countries and has typically centered on varia-
tions in socioeconomic status and its relation to the quantity of child-directed speech, 
such as the research on the ‘30-million-word gap’ in the United States (e.g. Suskind 
et al., 2015; see Ochs, Kremer-Sadl, 2020, for a critique). However, we believe that a 
focus on differences in socio-communicative context instead might be more produc-
tive. For example, studies of socially diverse communities in the United States have 
revealed efficient alternatives to child-directed speech as avenues for language acqui-
sition, such as learning through observation (Silva et al., 2010) or inter-child collabo-
ration (Alcalá et  al., 2018). As with fine-grained contrasts, within-language 
comparisons are equally informative whether they are conducted within well-studied 
or understudied languages.
Our systematic multipronged comparative approach to cross-linguistic research on 
language acquisition dovetails nicely with the call by Kidd and Garcia (2022) for 
more research on understudied languages. We agree with them that ‘(. . .) when we 
ask the right questions of them, research on lesser studied and typologically diverse 
languages can move us forward at a faster rate than work on typically studied European 
languages’ (p. 4). However, we would add that this will primarily be the case for 
coarse-grained comparisons. When it comes to both fine-grained and within-language 
comparisons, we are likely to learn as much – or perhaps even more, given the wealth 
of knowledge we already have about them – from well-studied languages as from 
understudied ones.
Kidd and Garcia (2022) correctly point out that working with understudied languages 
is both time-consuming and difficult. Moreover, given financial, familial, and practical 
considerations, going into the field to study such languages is not feasible for all scholars 
of language acquisition. We suggest, however, that we still have much to learn of theo-
retical importance by investigating how well-studied languages are acquired – especially 
when such studies are conducted within a systematic comparative approach to linguistic 
diversity. Only then can we hope to reap the full benefit from studying the world’s more 
than 7,000 natural experiments in the cultural evolution of language (Christiansen & 
Chater, 2022).
