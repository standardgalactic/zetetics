THERE IS A BETTER TYPEWRITER KEYBOARD 
AUGUST DVORAK, Lieut. Comdr., USNR 
(Formerly Director of Research, University of Washington) 
How 
THE PRESENT SO-CALLED U N I -
VERSAL (STANDARD) 
KEYBOARD 
WAS DESIGNED 
In 1873 Christopher Latham Sholes 
designed, and the Remington Arms 
Company put on the market, the first 
workable 
typewriter. 
By 
modern 
standards, 
the 
machine 
was 
very 
crude. The platen, mounted above the 
type bars, formed a sort of crude 
diameter for the type bars, which hung 
downward in a circle beneath it. The 
type bars, operated by wires connected 
to the key bars, came up to the platen 
as radii of the typebar circle, and pro-
duced typing on the under side of the 
platen. When released, .the type bars 
returned by force of gravity. The net 
result was obviously slow and sluggish. 
The 
keyboard 
arrangement 
of 
Sholes' 1873 typewriter was typically 
the product of its time. Sholes' aim 
was to develop a machine that would 
write with print characters and could 
be operated at the then inconceivably 
dazzling rate of ''equal to handwrit-
ing." He expected that typist's would 
"hunt and neck" with the first finger 
of each hand. Touch typing and type-
writing speed as we know them today 
were not then even being imagined. 
But Sholes' primary problems were 
mechanical. The action of his machine 
was so sluggish that to avoid the clash-
ing of typebars being struck in succes-
sion he purposely sought to locate in 
different 
quadrants of the typebar 
circle the letters most frequently used 
together in words. For the modern 
touch typist, the keyboard resulting 
from these concepts and mechanical 
difficulties was one of the worst ar-
rangements possible.* Yet with one 
little change that keyboard is the so-
called Standard Keyboard of today. 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE SO-
CALLED-STANDARD KEYBOARD? 
In 1925 Ford's study of the inci-
dence of typist errors disclosed that the 
most frequently 
mistyped words in 
their order of frequency were—the, to, 
oj, and, is, which, it, that, when, jor, 
with, here, be, etc. The mistyping of 
such common monosyllables could not 
be attributed to insufficient practice, 
infrequent use, difficulty of spelling, 
lack of familiarity. It was apparent that 
other factors not commonly considered 
were involved. 
Further 
disclosures 
by 
Kochka,1 
Kibby,2 and. Carmichael3 were to the 
effect that student typing performances 
•It is possible to make at random dozens of type-
writer keyboards which are as good or better than the 
"•Sholes" Universal 
Keyboard. It the letters and 
characters^ the lower three rows of keys on the 
"Sholes" Keyboard are drawn jrom a ha; and placed 
by pure chance, keyboard arrangements frequently 
are secured on which the total hand and finger loads 
are more equitably divided, on which there is better 
row-load distribution (Figure 1), on which there are 
fewer one-hand words, and on which there are 
fewer awkwardly stroked letter-sequences (Figure 2) 
than on the mentioned "Sholes" Universal Keyboard.

after one or two years of training were 
disappointingly low. Moreover, it was 
an accepted practice for students de-
siring to acquire a salable skill in type-
writing to supplement two years of 
high school training with an additional 
year of business college. Manifestly, 
something was fundamentally wrong 
with the whole system. 
Two grants from the Carnegie Cor-
poration of New York through the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advance-
ment of Teaching made possible a 
study of the problems of teaching and 
learning typewriting. This study dis-
closed 
what 
many 
teachers 
and 
typists suspected, viz., that typing was 
needlessly difficult to master,' slozv, in-
accurate, and fatiguing because of the 
keyboard arrangement. 
Typewriting is basically a neuro-
muscular skill. As such it is subject to 
the principles developed in the analyses 
of skills. Inspired by the work of 
Frank B. Gilbreth the writer and his 
colleagues decided on the time and 
motion-study approach in their analysis 
of typewriting skill. Principles which 
seemed to apply to typewriting are: 
1. Simple motions, simple motion 
patterns, and simple processes 
are easier to master than intricate 
and complicated ones. 
2. Simple motions, simple motion 
patterns, and simple processes 
are easier to execute rapidly and 
correctly than are intricate and 
complicated ones. 
3. Short movements require less 
time and energy than longer 
movements. 
4. Unnecessary motions increase 
the time, energy, and feeling costs 
. of processes. 
5. In integrated or sequential skills, 
the time required lor slowest 
steps, or the slowest members, or 
the most overworked members 
(bottlenecks) 
determines 
the 
final production rates. 
6. Rhythmic motions, rhythmic mo-
tion 
patterns, 
and 
rhythmic 
sequences of motions are less 
fatiguing than are erratic ones. 
7. In integrated or sequential proc-
esses involving several members, 
fatigue of any member • is in-
fluenced in a large measure by 
the extent that necessary motions 
and energy output are equitably 
distributed or inequitably con-
centrated. Processes with sharp 
and severe peaks in' necessary 
energy output arid concentration 
are fatiguing. 
S. Even timing, smoothly flowing 
motions, and absence of operator 
tension are characteristic of well-
planned processes. 
9. Concentration, energy, and feel-
ing costs determine for operators 
the effect of pleasantness or un-
pleasantness of processes. 
In the light of the above principles, 
six defects or handicaps to easy mo-
tions and efficient 
operation were 
discovered to be inherent in the old 
keyboard: 
A. The so-called Standard Keyboard 
overloads the commonly weaker 
left hand. The characters struck 
by the fingers of the left hand 
make up 57% of ordinary, copy, 
leaving only..43% for the more 
skillful right hand, clearly violat-
ing principles 5 and 7 above, 
B. The so-called Standard Key-
board, designed for one-, or two-
finger typing, overworks certain 
fingers, and does not assign 
enough work to others, and defi-

nitely violates principles 5 and 7 
which in turn violates principles 
6, Si arid 9. 
C. The so-called Standard Key-
board causes too little typing 
(only 32%) to be done on the 
home- or guide-row. Too much 
(68%) of the typing is done on 
the upper (52%) and the lower 
(16%) rows. It violates prin-
ciples 3, 4, and 6 above. 
D. The so-called Standard Key-
1 board requires the fingers to 
execute an excessive amount of 
jumping back and forth from 
row to row, e.g., in the high-fre-
quency, same-finger, letter-
sequences, as br, cc, cc, rv, ny, 
my, um, tin, mu, nu, mi, ni, im, 
in, om, on, mo,.no. A good typist's 
finger, tips travel from 12 to 20 
miles a day in these small but 
frequent and intricate hurdles 
and reaches from row to row. 
This condition wrecks havoc 
with principles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 
and 9. 
E.'Toq.few words—only about 100 
(including plurals and s forms of 
verbs)—can be typed exclusively 
on the. so-called Standard Key-
board home-row. Consequently 
for almost every word the fingers 
must reach up to the third or 
down to the first row—very fre-
quently from the first to the third 
and back again as for instance, in 
such words, as, expect, extreme, 
December, nerve, minimum, mo-
nopoly. 
F. The so-called Standard Keyboard 
requires that over 3,300 different 
words be typed by the weaker 
left hand alone while the stronger 
and more agile right hand idles, 
e.g., such common words as ex-
tra, exaggerate, address, was, 
were, etc. Over 500 words, e.g., 
hoop, mink, monopoly, kill, hill, 
mill, etc, must be typed by the 
right hand alone while the left 
hand idles. In a word like mini' 
mum both defects D and F are 
combined. This condition is a 
serious violation of principle 
5. 
How 
HAVE THE DEFECTS OF THE 
OLD KEYBOARD BEEN REMEDIED? 
The Simplified Keyboard was de-
signed on the basis of scientific data 
relative to the frequency of use of dif-
ferent letters, and the frequency of 
different two, three, four and five 
letter-sequences. The aim was to ar-
range the keys in a four-row, 42-key 
keyboard so as to remove completely 
or practically completely each of the 
defects (A to. F) in the so-called 
Standard Keyboard. 
The removal of those defects re-
sulted in an arrangement which did 
not violate the nine principles of motion 
study. The data on the rearrangement 
show that: 
The following consequences flow 
from the foregoing defects in the so-
called Standard Keyboard arrange-
ment : (a) the mastery of skillful type-
writing is unnecessarily difficult and 
time-consuming, (b) typewriting rates 
are lowered by the extreme complexity 
of the motions, (c) typists make more 
typographical errors than they would 
if the motions were simpler and more 
evenly balanced between the two 
hands and the eight fingers, and (d) 
the unnecessarily intricate and exces-
sive motions cause mental tension, 
typist-fatigue, and decreased efficiency 
and accuracy. 

A. On the Simplified Keyboard the 
right hand docs more work than 
the left—56% and 44%, respec-
tively. 
B. On the Simplified Keyboard the 
work assigned to the different 
fingers is proportionate to their 
skill and strength. 
C. On 
the 
Simplified 
Keyboard 
70% of the typing is done on the 
home row—only 22% in the 
third, and 8% in the lower row. 
D. On 
the 
Simplified 
Keyboard 
finger motions from row to row 
have been reduced by more than 
90%. 
A 
100-word-pcr-minute 
typist's finger tips in an eight-
hour day travel only a little over 
a mile in motions from row to 
row as compared to 12 to 20 
miles a day for a typist on the 
Standard Keyboard. There arc 
only two infrequently used Iclter-
scquence hurdles, xp and rr, on 
the Simplified Kcylxrard. 
K. On 
the 
Simplified 
Keyboard 
more than 3,000 different words 
(35% of all the words used in 
ordinary copy) are tyjx'd ex-
clusively in the hump row. 
/ 
F. On the Simplified Keyboard only 
61 different, infrequently used, 
monosyllabic words are tyi>cd 
exclusively by one hand whereas 
over 3.S00 different words are 
typed by one hand on the Stand-
ard Keyboard.

How 
SUPERIOR Is THE SIMPLIFIED 
KEYBOARD? 
For forty years the annual Inter-
national Typewriting Contests were 
considered the proving ' ground for 
typewriters and for methods of teach-
ing typewriting. In these contests 
from 1933 to 1941, students from the 
writer's classes, using different makes 
of typewriters equipped with the Sim-
plified Keyboard, competed against the 
outstanding typists selected each year 
from approximately a million student 
typists in].the United States. In nine 
contests Simplified Keyboard typists 
successively set 26 International rec-
ords; won 45 first places; won 115 
first, second and third places; won four 
grand championships; and four times 
won the Stowell Trophy for fastest dic-
tating machine 
transcription. 
Miss 
Velma Crismon, a 16-year-old high 
school student, set a world record for 
high school students of 128 words 
per minute. Miss Lenore Fenton set 
several world records, including one of 
108 net words per minute in 30-minute 
dictating machine transcription and 
was recently selected as the demon-
strator in several U. S. Navy Training 
Films on typing. 
The 
International 
Commercial 
Schools Contest Committee during the 
years 1933-1941 rigorously maintained 
eligibility rules which insured that stu-
dent typists competing in each class 
had equivalent amounts of training. 
Consequently 
Simplified 
Keyboard 
student contest winnings and records 
indicate the advantages of the Simpli-
fied Kcylxiard for outstnnding typists. 
At the University of Chicago Lab-
oratory School typewriting is offered 

to seventh and eighth grade pupils as 
a general education subject. Although 
the instruction time in these seventh 
and eighth grade typing classes is less 
than;509& of the time allowed so-called 
Standard Keyboard high school typing 
students, the Laboratory class average 
be mastered for any given typing level 
in about 50% of the time usually re-
quired for students to reach the same 
average level of performance on the so-
called standard keyboard. 
This economy in learning time will 
result in cither an annual saving of

performances on the Simplified Key-
board exceed those of high school 
typing students with twice the instruc-
tion time on the old so-called Standard 
Keyboard. The results reported for 
high school classes ("see figure) on 
the Simplified Keyboard with similar 
instruction time confirms the conclu-
sion that the Simplified Keyboard can 
approximately thirty million dollars in 
the cost of teaching typewriting in the 
United States or the opportunity to 
provide 
typewriting 
instruction

twice the present number of typing stu-
dents with the present cost and facili-

The must acatratc study of typing 
accuracy mi the old so-called Standard 
and the new Simplified Keyboards is 
. a l'h.D. Thesis-by Davis.1 This study 
revealed (4) That, Simplified Key-
• lioard students make fewer typo-
graphical errors than do old standard 
keyboard typists, and (2) that whereas 
on the old standard keyboard the most 
frequently mistyped words are simple, 
short words like to, of, the, is, etc.,.on 
the. Simplified Keyboard the words 
most frequently mistyped are beautiful, 
obliijc, certain, everything, October, 
possible, committee, principle, arrange-
ment, character, addition, particular, 
January, nezi; during, etc. It is evident 
that errors on the Simplified Keyboard 
are on long words and on words with 
inherent spelling difficulties rather than 
on short words requiring intricate 
finger motions. . 
Davis' study of errors on the two 
keyboards showed that on the so-
called Standard Keyboard the errors 
on the 100 simple but most frequently 
mistyped words comprise more than 
• two-thirds of all the errors tabulated, 
indicating inherently difficult motions. 
Whereas the 3.00 most frequently mis-
typed words on the Simplified Key-
board, constitute less than two-thirds 
of the total errors tabulated, indicating 
that a. large proportion of the errors 
on the Simplified Keyboard are random 
or chance errors and arc not therefore 
errors due to difficulties inherent in the 
motions involved in typing on the Sim-
plified Keyboard.

fied Typewriter Keyboard." Journal of Business 
Education, May. June, Septerolier, and October, 
Uicasiiics ut leaf oi errors, nieiuai ten-
sion and fatigue, are not available. The 
„ best practical and cpmparative data on 
the above are first, the testimony of 
typists who have used both keyboards. 
These typists are unanimous in their 
statements that they "do not get as 
tired.from typing all day on the Simpli-
fied Keylward as they did on the old 
• Standard Keyboard." Simplified Key-
board typists are relieved of the fear of 
errors common to Standard Keyboard 
. typists. That freedom from fear is evi-
dent in their appearance of relaxation, 
ease and confidence. 
Second, Standard Keyboard typists 
who were retrained to use the Simpli-
fied Keyboard are unanimous in their 
statements that they will not go back 
to so-called standard keyboard typing 
unless forced to do so by the most 
stringent of necessities. Other evidence 
is the extent that typist production or 
output in the afternoon is maintained 
at the typists' morning level. Employ-
ers arc agreed that the end-of-the-day 
production of Simplified 
Keyboard 
typists is superior to that of old-
standard keyboard typists, and thai 
every observation of typists indicates 
the Simplified Keyboard is conducive 
lu less tension, greater enjoyment of 
typists in their work, greater accuracy, 
and consequently greater daily output. 
WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THE 
SiMi'Lii-iEn KEYBOARD?" 
Few important improvements have 
ever been available at so.-little cost and 
difficulty as is the adoption of the 
Simplified Keyboard. Before "Pearl 
Harbor" new typewriters with the 
Simplified Keyboard were sold at the 
same price as new machines with the 
old keyboard. Present old keyboard 
machines may be converted to the 

Simplified Keyboard in local type-
writer shops by changing the key cards 
or keys, and removing and resoldering 
the type (heads) on typebar's to cor-
respond to the changed keyboard ar-
rangement Prior to "Pearl Harbor" 
the cost of this change ranged from 
$10.00 to $15.00; it may be higher now. 
Another method of converting old key-
board typewriters to the new arrange-
ment is to remove the typebars and 
have them retyped at the factory. 
All objections to the adoption of the 
Simplified Keyboard seem to dwell 
upon the feasibility and the advisability 
of permitting students and typists to 
.use or to learn to use a keyboard ar-
rangement because it is different, re-
gardless of how much better it may be. 
Manifesdy, if such objections had pre-
vailed, the public would not today 
have the advantages of Frigidaire, 
radio, the automobile, steam engine, 
or even typewriters with the present 
1873-keyboard. 
In offices and industry, both public 
and private, and in our economic and 
social philosophy, time and people are 
valuable. In offices, the typewriter is 
the sine qua non of both. Despite such 
importance, however, it is the least ex-
pensive item in the cost of stenographic 
work. The major item is the stenogra-
pher's salary. Next come space, heat 
and light, and supplies, and finally the 
typewriter which represents a mere 
J/2% to V/2% of the total. Thus it is 
apparent that a 15% economy on the 
major cost of stenography—the typist's 
salary—in one year will cover the 
typewriter cost for at least 10 years. 
Economies, like those above men-
tioned, invariably accompany adoption 
of the Simplified Keyboard. Firms that 
have employed typists, who were re-
trained to use iimpnned Keyooara 
typewriters report a 25% to 35% im-
provement in the efficiency and. output 
of such typists. 
RETRAINING OLD KEYBOARD TYPISTS 
Retraining universal or so-called 
standard keyboard typists to use the 
Simplified Keyboard is surprisingly 
easy, practical, and economical. Typing 
that is more accurate, more rapid, and 
less fatiguing than old keyboard typing 
may be achieved within five to ten 
weeks, depending upon the amount of 
time devoted daily to retraining. Su-
perior so-called—standard keyboard 
typists require 
approximately 
100 
hours for retraining to secure a 35% 
to 50% improvement in daily output 
(speed and accuracy). Slow and 
mediocre standard keyboard typists 
frequently double and even triple their 
typing performance after 100 hours of 
retraining. 
In the present manpower shortage, 
the ease of, and the shortened time re-
quired for, mastering typing on the 
Simplified Keyboard are an asset in 
training typists for replacements and 
increases in stenographic personnel. 
The conversion of all typists in the 
United States to the Simplified Key-
board would through the resulting im-
proved efficiency increase stenographic 
production by an equivalent of approxi-
mately 8,000,000 stenographic hours 
daily. This result, in a critical sector 
of our prosecution of the war, would 
have immediate incalculable value; sub-
sequently, when children learn to type 
in the Junior High School, Simplified 
Keyboard typewriters are destined to 
be an educational tool of students and 
scholars—as common in homes as 
radios and automobiles.
