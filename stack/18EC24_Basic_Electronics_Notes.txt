Chapter-1: Semiconductor Diodes. 
 
Introduction:  
 
Semiconductor is a chemical Element in which the conductivity lies between conductor 
and insulator, Hence the movement of electrons (Current Conduction) can be controlled easily by 
means of an external voltage (Biasing). 
 
Two types of Semiconductors  
1. Intrinsic Semiconductor (Pure Semiconductor) and  
2. Extrinsic Semiconductor (Impure semiconductor/Added impurity) 
 
Extrinsic semiconductor is further classified into two types 
a. P-Type Extrinsic Semiconductor (Doping Trivalent element) and 
b. N-Type Extrinsic Semiconductor (Doping Pentavalent element). 
 
The holes are majority charge carriers and electrons are minority charge carriers in P-Type and 
electrons are majority and holes are minority charge carriers in case of N-Type Semiconductor. 
 
P-N Junction(Semiconductor Diode/ Diode): 
 
Construction: + 
 
Starting with a piece of intrinsic semiconductor and divide it into two halves, one half is 
doped with any tri-valent element such as Boron, Aluminum etc., to form P-Type semiconductor, 
in which the holes are majority charge carriers and electrons are minority charge carriers. Other 
half is doped with any penta-valent element such as phosphorus, arsenic etc., to form N-Type 
Semiconductor, in which the electrons are majority charge carriers and holes are minority charge 
carriers.  
The Junction or a line dividing the P-Type and N-Type is called P-N Junction. Metallic 
contact is connected to P-Type and N-Type material to get terminals for the device called 
Electrodes such as Anode and Cathode, this device is called P-N Junction Diode or Semiconductor 
diode or simply Diode as shown in figure(1). 
 
Figure(1): P-N Junction Diode/Diode 
 
Working:  
 
The working principle can be studied in three different operations or Biasing arrangements 
as follows. 
 
Case (1): Zero Biasing.  
Without any external supply and at normal room temperature, at the time of contact with 
P-Type and N-Type material, it has a tendency to move or diffusing the electrons from N side and

occupies holes from the P side. Similarly holes in the P side attract electrons in the N side. This 
results forming a thin layer near the P-N Junction due to loosing electrons near the junction from 
the N side and holes near the junction from the P side. This layer or region is called depletion layer 
and it acts as an intrinsic semiconductor as shown in figure (2).  
 
Figure (2): P-N Junction Diode/Diode with depletion layer/region. 
 
Case (2): Reverse Biasing. 
External supply with Positive terminal of the battery is connected to the cathode and 
negative terminal of the battery is connected to the anode is called Reverse biasing.  
With this biasing the negative terminal of the battery sucks out or attracts the holes from 
P- Type material and positive terminal of the battery sucks out or attract electrons from N-Type 
material, this results wider depletion region and the resistance is very high, and the current that 
flows through the device only due to minority charge carriers as shown in figure (3).  
The magnitude of current under reverse biasing is in terms of nano amperes for silicon 
diodes.  
 
Figure (3): P-N Junction Diode is under Reverse Biasing. 
 
Case (3): Forward Biasing. 
 
External Supply with Positive terminal of the battery is connected to the anode and negative 
terminal of the battery is connected to the cathode is called forward biasing. 
With this biasing the negative terminal of the battery pushes or pumps more electrons to 
the N-Type material and positive terminal of the battery pushes or pumps more holes to the P-
Type material. By go on increasing the biasing voltage the width of the depletion region decreases, 
Resistance decreases and the current flowing through the device is increases( not proportional to 
voltage). If the Biasing voltage VS   is greater than or equal to Vγ (Thresold Voltage) the depletion 
layer completely vanishes and easily current will flow as shown in figure (4).The cut in voltage or 
threshold voltage (Vγ) for silicon diodes is 0.7 V and for Germanium diodes is 0.3V.

Figure (5) shows the V-I Characteristics of P-N Junction diode, VS is the biasing voltage, 
ID is the Diode Current and VBD is the Break down voltage. The leakage current flows through the 
device under reverse biasing due to minority charge carriers. Under forward biasing and biasing 
voltage is greater than or equal to the threshold voltage, the device then acts as a conducting 
material.

Equivalent Circuit of diode: 
1. DC Equivalent Circuit. 
The DC equivalent circuit of a diode under reverse biasing is an open circuit or Reverse 
Resistance Rr(typically in terms of MΩ) shown in figure (6a), and under forward biasing as shown 
in figure (6). Where Rf is the forward resistance of the diode, VON is the voltage drop across the 
diode under Conduction State (VON=0.7V for Silicon diodes and VON=0.3V for Germanium 
Diodes).

Figure (6b): Diode DC Equivalent Circuit under forward biasing. 
 
2. AC Equivalent Circuit. 
The AC equivalent circuit of a diode under reverse biasing and for forward biasing is the 
parallel connection of a Resistor and a Capacitor as shown in figure (7a) and figure (7b) 
respectively. 
Under reverse biasing the depletion layer width increases and acts as a parallel plate 
capacitor with dielectric, hence the diode will be considered as a capacitor called Transition 
Capacitance/ Junction Capacitance/ Space charge Capacitance. 
 
Figure (7a): AC Equivalent circuit under Reverse Biasing. 
Under forward biasing the rate of change of charge carriers increases with respect to the 
applied forward voltage, hence the diode under forward biasing acts as a capacitor called 
diffusion Capacitance.

Effect of Temperature on Diodes: 
The number of charge carriers will vary depending on the temperature. i.e., if temperature 
increases the number of charge carriers also increases and due to this the conduction current (ID) 
also increases. The relation between current, voltage and temperature is as follows. 
 
 The reverse saturation current doubles for every 10oC rise in Temperature. 
i.e.,  𝑰𝑶
’ = 𝑰𝑶 𝒙 𝟐( 𝒕𝟐−𝒕𝟏
𝟏𝟎)  ; 
where,  
IO’ is the reverse saturation current at temperature t2 and 
IO is the reverse saturation current at temperature t1. 
 
 The forward voltage drop across the diode reduces 2.56mV for every 1oC rise in 
temperature. 
i.e., 𝑽𝑭
′ = VF −𝟐. 𝟓𝟔𝒎(𝒕𝟐−𝒕𝟏). 
Where, 
VF’ is the voltage drop across the diode at t2 and  
VF is the voltage drop across the diode at t1 
 
Rectifiers: 
Rectifiers are the electronics circuits that convert AC quantity into to DC quantity. This 
can be achieved by using unidirectional conduction devices like diode. 
Depending on the conduction angle the rectifier circuits are classified into two types, they 
are, 
1. Half wave Rectifier and  
2. Full wave Rectifier. 
The Full wave Rectifiers are further classified (based on number of diodes using) into two 
types, they are, 
a. Center Tap Transformer (Two Diodes) full wave rectifier and  
b. Bridge Type (Four Diodes) full wave rectifier. 
 
1. Half wave Rectifier: 
The half rectifier is an electronic circuit, which converts AC quantity into pulsating DC, 
by using a single diode with conduction angle only 180o that is only half cycle. 
 
Circuit Diagram: 
 
Figure (8): Half wave Rectifier circuit. 
 
Figure (8) shows the circuit diagram of a half wave rectifier, where D is a diode (Assume Diode 
is ideal), RL is the load resistor, input is an AC signal and output is the Pulsating DC Signal. 
 
Explanation:

Page 6 
 
During every Positive half cycle diode D conducts and acts as a short circuit, hence the 
current flows through the Load resistor and is proportional to the input voltage according to Ohm’s 
law, therefore the voltage across RL is same as input signal. 
i.e., 𝑽𝒐= 𝑽𝒊 
 
During every negative half cycle diode D does not conducts and acts as an open circuit and 
no current flows through the load element, hence the voltage across RL is zero. 
i.e., 𝑽𝒐= 𝟎 
 
Waveforms: 
Figure (9) shows the waveforms of an half wave rectifier circuit, and it can be observed that the 
output is only half cycle for every complete cycle input and also pulsating DC (Ripples/ some AC 
Components also present), i.e., not a pure DC.   
 
Figure (9): Input and Output Waveforms of a Half wave Rectifier circuit. 
 
Mathematical expressions: 
The output of half wave rectifier circuit is irregular in nature and hence, need to analyze the circuit 
for average DC and AC voltage or current along with the efficiency and ripple factor.

reverse voltage, which occurs at the peak of the input signal when the diode is reverse biased is 
called Peak Inverse Voltage or Peak Reverse Voltage.

Rectifier with C Filter: 
From the above discussion it was observed that the output of the rectifier is not a pure dc. 
i.e., some ac components (ripples) also present, to remove the ripples we need to connect a filter. 
Filter can be capacitor or inductor, in the following context the capacitor filter will be discussed. 
Filter is an electronic circuit which converts pulsating dc into pure dc. 
The property of the capacitor is that it allows the ac component (High frequency component and 
low resistance) and blocks the dc component (low frequency component and high resistance).  
 
Figure (10), shows the circuit diagram of an half-wave rectifier with capacitor filter, i.e., a 
capacitor is connected across the load resistor RL. When AC voltage is applied, during the positive 
half cycle, the diode D is forward biased and allows electric current through it and capacitor starts 
charging instantly to its maximum level. During negative half cycle diode does not conducts and 
no current flow through the capacitor and hence starts discharging slowly. The discharging time 
constant is given by, 
𝑻𝒅= 𝑪𝑹𝑳 
Note: If C or RL or both increases the discharging time also increases and we will get pure dc. For 
very high Td the capacitor never discharges and it acts as a voltage source of value is equal to load 
voltage. 
As we already know that, the capacitor provides high resistive path to dc components (low-
frequency signal) and low resistive path to ac components (high-frequency signal). 
Electric current always prefers to flow through a low resistance path. So when the electric 
current reaches the filter, the dc components experience a high resistance from the capacitor and 
ac components experience a low resistance from the capacitor.

Page 10 
 
The dc component does not like to flow through the capacitor (high resistance path). So 
they find an alternative path (low resistance path) and flows to the load resistor (RL) through that 
path shown in figure (11).  
 
 
Figure (10): Half wave Rectifier circuit with Capacitor Filter. 
 
Figure (11): Working of Capacitor filter. 
 
Electric current always prefers to flow through a low resistance path. So the AC 
components will flow through the capacitor whereas the DC components are blocked by the 
capacitor. Therefore, they find an alternate path and reach the output load resistor RL. The flow of 
AC components through the capacitor is nothing but the charging of a capacitor.

Advantage: 
 Simple and easy to construct. 
 PIV is only Vm. 
 
Disadvantages: 
 Conducts only half cycle, due to this more power will be wasted. 
 More ripples occur in the output. 
 
 
2. Full wave Rectifier using Center tap transformer: 
A full wave rectifier is a type of rectifier which converts both half cycles of the AC signal 
into pulsating DC signal. 
Circuit Diagram: 
 
Figure (13): Full-wave Rectifier circuit. 
 
As shown in the figure (13), the full wave rectifier converts both positive and negative half cycles 
of the input AC signal into output pulsating DC signal. 
 
Note: The center tapped transformer shown in figure (14), works almost similar to a normal 
transformer. Like a normal transformer, the center tapped transformer also increases or reduces 
the AC voltage. However, a center tapped transformer has another important feature. That is the 
secondary winding of the center tapped transformer divides the input AC current or AC signal (VP) 
into two parts.  
 
Figure (14): Working of Center Tapped Transformer. 
 
The upper part of the secondary winding produces a positive voltage V1 and the lower part of the 
secondary winding produces a negative voltage V2. When we combine these two voltages at output 
load, we get a complete AC signal. 
i.e. 𝑽𝑻𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 = 𝑽𝟏 + 𝑽𝟐 

Basic Electronics [18EC14/24] 
 
Prepared by Mohankumar V., Assistant Professor, Dept. of ECE, Dr.AIT 
Page 12 
 
The voltages V1 and V2 are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. That is the voltages 
(V1 and V2) produced by the upper part and lower part of the secondary winding are 180 degrees 
out of phase with each other. However, by using a full wave rectifier with center tapped 
transformer, we can produce the voltages that are in phase with each other. In simple words, by 
using a full wave rectifier with center tapped transformer, we can produce a current that flows only 
in single direction. 
 
The AC source is connected to the primary winding of the center tapped transformer. A 
center tap (additional wire) connected at the exact middle of the the secondary winding divides the 
input voltage into two parts. 
The upper part of the secondary winding is connected to the diode D1 and the lower part of the 
secondary winding is connected to the diode D2. Both diode D1 and diode D2 are connected to a 
common load RL with the help of a center tap transformer. The center tap is generally considered 
as the ground point or the zero voltage reference point. 
 
Explanation: 
The center tapped full wave rectifier uses a center tapped transformer and two diodes to 
convert the input AC voltage into output DC voltage. 
When input AC voltage is applied, the secondary winding of the center tapped transformer 
divides this input AC voltage into two parts: positive and negative.  
During every positive half cycle of the input AC signal, terminal A become positive, 
terminal B become negative and center tap is grounded (zero volts). The positive terminal A is 
connected to the p-side of the diode D1 and the negative terminal B is connected to the n-side of 
the diode D1. So the diode D1 is forward biased during the positive half cycle and allows electric 
current through it.  
 
Figure (15): Full-wave rectifier circuit during every positive half cycle. 
 
On the other hand, the negative terminal B is connected to the p-side of the diode D2 and 
the positive terminal A is connected to the n-side of the diode D2. So the diode D2 is reverse biased 
during every positive half cycle and does not allow electric current through it. 
The diode D1 supplies DC current to the load RL. The DC current produced at the load RL will 
return to the secondary winding through a center tap. 
i.e., 𝑽𝒐= 𝑽𝒊 
During the positive half cycle, current flows only in the upper part of the circuit while the 
lower part of the circuit carry no current to the load because the diode D2 is reverse biased. Thus, 
during the positive half cycle of the input AC signal, only diode D1 allows electric current while 
diode D2 does not allow electric current as shown in figure (15). 
During every negative half cycle of the input AC signal, terminal A become negative, 
terminal B become positive and center tap is grounded (zero volts). The negative terminal A is 
connected to the p-side of the diode D1 and the positive terminal B is connected to the n-side of 
the diode D1. So the diode D1 is reverse biased during the negative half cycle and does not allow 
electric current through it.

Figure (16): Full-Wave Rectifier during every negative half cycle. 
On the other hand, the positive terminal B is connected to the p-side of the diode D2 and 
the negative terminal A is connected to the n-side of the diode D2. So the diode D2 is forward 
biased during the negative half cycle and allows electric current through it. 
The diode D2 supplies DC current to the load RL. The DC current produced at the load RL will 
return to the secondary winding through a center tap as shown in figure (16). 
During the negative half cycle, current flows only in the lower part of the circuit while the 
upper part of the circuit carry no current to the load because the diode D1 is reverse biased. Thus, 
during the negative half cycle of the input AC signal, only diode D2 allows electric current while 
diode D1 does not allow electric current. 
Thus, the diode D1 allows electric current during the positive half cycle and diode 
D2 allows electric current during the negative half cycle of the input AC signal. As a result, both 
half cycles (positive and negative) of the input AC signal are allowed. So the output DC voltage 
is almost equal to the input AC voltage as shown in figure (17).  
 
Figure (17): Full-wave rectifier with total output. 
 
The diodes D1 and D2 are commonly connected to the load RL. So the load current is the sum of 
individual diode currents. 
We know that a diode allows electric current in only one direction. From the figure (17),  we can 
see that both the diodes D1 and D2 are allowing current in the same direction. 
We know that a current that flows in only single direction is called a direct current. So the 
resultant current at the output (load) is a direct current (DC). However, the direct current appeared 
at the output is not a pure direct current but a pulsating direct current. 
The value of the pulsating direct current changes with respect to time. This is due to the 
ripples in the output signal. These ripples can be reduced by using filters such as capacitor and 
inductor. 
The average output DC voltage across the load resistor is double that of the single half wave 
rectifier circuit.

Waveforms: 
 The output waveforms of the full wave rectifier is shown in figure (18).  
 
Figure (18): waveforms of full wave rectifier. 
The first waveform represents an input AC signal. The second waveform and third 
waveform represents the DC signals or DC current produced by diode D1 and diode D2. The last 
waveform represents the total output DC current produced by diodes D1and D2. From the above 
waveforms, we can conclude that the output current produced at the load resistor is not a pure DC 
but a pulsating DC.

Full-wave Rectifier with C Filter: 
 
The filter is an electronic device that converts the pulsating Direct Current into pure Direct 
Current. 
In the circuit diagram, the capacitor C is placed across the load resistor RL. 
 
Note: The working of the full-wave rectifier with filter is almost similar to that of the half wave 
rectifier with filter. The only difference is that in the half wave rectifier only one half cycles (either 
positive or negative) of the input AC current will charge the capacitor but the remaining half cycle 
will not charge the capacitor. But in full wave rectifier, both positive and negative half cycles of 
the input AC current will charge the capacitor. 
 
The main duty of the capacitor filter is to short the ripples to the ground and blocks the 
pure DC (DC components), so that it flows through the alternate path and reaches output load 
resistor RL. 
 
Figure (19) shows the circuit diagram of a full-wave rectifier with Capacitor filter, when input AC 
voltage is applied, during the positive half cycle, the diode D1 is forward biased and allows electric 
current whereas the diode D2 is reverse biased and blocks electric current. On the other hand, 
during the negative half cycle the diode D2 is forward biased (allows electric current) and the diode 
D1 is reverse biased (blocks electric current).

Figure (19): Full-wave Rectifier circuit with Capacitor filter. 
 
During the positive half cycle, the diode (D1) current reaches the filter and charges the 
capacitor. However, the charging of the capacitor happens only when the applied AC voltage is 
greater than the capacitor voltage. 
Initially, the capacitor is uncharged. That means no voltage exists between the plates of the 
capacitor. So when the voltage is turned on, the charging of the capacitor happens immediately. 
During this conduction period, the capacitor charges to the maximum value of the input 
supply voltage. The capacitor stores a maximum charge exactly at the quarter positive half cycle 
in the waveform. At this point, the supply voltage is equal to the capacitor voltage.  
 
Figure (20): Full-wave Rectifier filtered output. 
 
When the AC voltage starts decreasing and becomes less than the capacitor voltage, then 
the capacitor starts slowly discharging as shown in figure (20). 
The discharging of the capacitor is very slow as compared to the charging of the capacitor. 
So the capacitor does not get enough time to completely discharge. Before the complete discharge 
of the capacitor happens, the charging again takes place. So only half or more than half of the 
capacitor charge get discharged. 
When the input AC supply voltage reaches the negative half cycle, the diode D1 is reverse 
biased (blocks electric current) whereas the diode D2 is forward biased (allows electric current). 
During the negative half cycle, the diode (D2) current reaches the filter and charges the capacitor. 
However, the charging of the capacitor happens only when the applied AC voltage is greater than 
the capacitor voltage. 
The capacitor is not completely uncharged, so the charging of the capacitor does not happen 
immediately. When the supply voltage becomes greater than the capacitor voltage, the capacitor 
again starts charging. 
In both positive and negative half cycles, the current flows in the same direction across the 
load resistor RL. So we get either complete positive half cycles or negative half cycles. In our case, 
they are complete positive half cycles.

3. Bridge type Full wave Rectifies: 
The Bridge Type Full-wave rectifier is an electronic circuit, which converts AC quantity 
into pulsating DC, by using the four diodes with conduction angle only 360o that is complete cycle. 
 
Circuit Diagram: 
The Circuit diagram of a bridge rectifier is shown in figure (21). The bridge rectifier is 
made up of four diodes namely D1, D2, D3, D4 and load resistor RL. The four diodes are connected 
in a closed loop (Bridge) configuration to efficiently convert the Alternating Current (AC) into 
Direct Current (DC).  
 
Figure (21): Full-wave Bridge Rectifier Circuit diagram. 
 
Explanation:  
The input AC signal is applied across two terminals A and B and the output DC signal is 
obtained across the load resistor RL which is connected between the terminals C and D. 
The four diodes D1, D2, D3, D4 are arranged in series with only two diodes allowing electric 
current during each half cycle. For example, diodes D1 and D2 are considered as one pair which 
allows electric current during the positive half cycle whereas diodes D3 and D4 are considered as 
another pair which allows electric current during the negative half cycle of the input AC signal. 
When input AC signal is applied across the bridge rectifier, during the positive half cycle 
diodes D1 and D2 are forward biased and allows electric current while the diodes D3 and D4 are 
reverse biased and blocks electric current. On the other hand, during the negative half cycle diodes 
D3 and D4 are forward biased and allow electric current while diodes D1 and D2 are reverse biased 
and blocks electric current. 
During the positive half cycle, the terminal A becomes positive while the terminal B becomes 
negative. This causes the diodes D1 and D2 forward biased and at the same time, it causes the 
diodes D3 and D4 reverse biased. 
The current flow direction during the positive half cycle is shown in the figure (22) (i.e. A to D to 
C to B).

Figure (22): Bridge Rectifier during every positive half cycle. 
 
During the negative half cycle, the terminal B becomes positive while the terminal A becomes 
negative. This causes the diodes D3 and D4 forward biased and at the same time, it causes the 
diodes D1 and D2reverse biased. 
The current flow direction during negative half cycle is shown in figure (23) (I.e. B to D to C to 
A).  
 
Figure (23): Bridge Rectifier during every negative half cycle. 
 
From the two figures (22 and 23), we can observe that the direction of current flow across 
load resistor RL is same during the positive half cycle and negative half cycle. Therefore, the 
polarity of the output DC signal is same for both positive and negative half cycles. The output DC 
signal polarity may be either completely positive or negative. In our case, it is completely 
positive. If the direction of diodes is reversed then we get a complete negative DC voltage.  
Thus, a bridge rectifier allows electric current during both positive and negative half cycles of the 
input AC signal. 
The output waveforms of the bridge rectifier is shown in figure (24).

Choke Filter: 

Basic Electronics [18EC14/24]

Page 22 
 
 
Choke filter is a circuit consists of an inductor connected in series with load and capacitor 
connected across the load. The choke filter is also called L-section filter as shown in figure (25). 
 
Figure (25): Choke Filter. 
The choke filter is used to remove the ripples present in the rectified output. The Pulsating DC 
signal pass through the inductor or choke will blocks ac and allows dc and further the ripples i.e., 
some of the residual ripples will get bypassed through the capacitor (capacitor blocks dc and allows 
ac). Hence from the choke filtered output is pure dc.  
The Ripple factor of a filtered output signal is given by 
 
𝛾= 1.19
𝐿𝐶 
 
Significance of Choke filters: 
 The series inductor filter decreases the current, and shunt capacitor filter increases the current. 
 
Zener Diode: 
 
The reverse current through the normal diode is in terms of microamperes and it is almost 
constant until the reverse voltage is less than break down voltage, if the reverse voltage is greater 
than or equal to the break down voltage the junction breaks and high current will flow through the 
device and more power will be dissipated then the device may be destroyed or damaged.  
 
If we limit the current through the device by means of connecting a resistor in series with 
the device, the power dissipation reduces and the device may not be destroyed even under 
breakdown region. By using this principle the special type of diode is designed by Clearance Zener 
called as Zener diode. 
There are two types of breakdown occurs in Zener diode depending on the break down 
voltage levels. 
i) Zener Break down: 
This type of breakdown occurs in the device if the breakdown voltage is less than or equal 
to 6V(typically), this strong electric field at the junction becomes very large and breaks the 
covalent bonds to release free electrons, due to this very high current will flow through the device. 
This mechanism or process is called ionization by Electric field. 
 
ii) Avalanche Breakdown: 
This type of breakdown occurs in the device if the breakdown voltage is greater than 6V 
(Typically), this high potential forces minority charge carriers to move quickly means kinetic 
energy increases, due to this the minority charge carriers collide with atoms to break covalent 
bonds which increase the free electrons and hence the current increases sharply. This process or 
mechanism is called, Impact Ionization or Ionization by collision. In this mechanism, the free 
electrons increase in multiples and hence called avalanche breakdown.

VI Characteristics of Zener Diode:

Zener Diode Voltage Regulator: 
Zener diode provides constant voltage if the Zener Current is between IZmin to IZmax under 
reverse biasing, this feature of Zener diode will be utilized to design a voltage regulator.  
Voltage regulator is a system which produces the constant voltage irrespective of variations 
in line (Input) and load. 
Figure (27) shows the circuit diagram of a Zener Diode Voltage Regulator. Where, R is the 
Series Resistor used to limit or control the sharp current flowing through the Zener diode under 
breakdown condition, RL is the Load resistance, Vi is the unregulated power supply, IZ is the 
current through the Zener diode, IL is the load current, VR is the voltage drop across series resistor. 
VZ is the Zener Voltage, Vo is the voltage across the load resistor called output voltage and I is the 
input current. 
 
Figure (27): Zener Diode Voltage Regulator Circuit. 
 
From the above figure, the input unregulated power supply Vi, Positive terminal is 
connected to the cathode terminal and negative terminal is connected to the anode terminal, hence 
the Zener diode is operating in the reverse biasing mode. 
And the above circuit provides a constant voltage even by varying the input voltage and 
varying load, i.e., provides regulation for both line and load. 

Basic Electronics [18EC14/24]

Page 24 
 
 
Case(i): Line Regulation; Variable input and constant load: 
 
 If the input voltage Vi is less than the Zener Voltage VZ ( Zener Break Down Voltage), the 
output voltage is same as the input voltage Vi, because the Zener diode is in off state, if the input 
voltage is greater than the Zener voltage VZ, the diode in ON state and hence it acts as a voltage 
source of VZ Volts.  
 
If Vi increases, the input current I also increases, and IZ increases to maintain IL constant, 
but IZ should be between IZmin to IZmax. 
If Vi decreases, the input current I also decreases, and IZ decreases to maintain IL constant, 
but IZ should be between IZmin to IZmax. 
 
Therefore the voltage across the load resistor constant and is given by 
Vo=VZ 
 
Case(ii): Load Regulation; Fixed input and variable load: 
 
If RL increases, IL decreases and to keep input current I constant IZ increases, but IZ should 
be between IZmin to IZmax. 
 
If RL decreases, IL increases and to keep input current I constant IZ decreases, but 
IZ should be between IZmin to IZmax. 
Therefore the voltage across the load resistor constant and is given by 
Vo=VZ 
 
Special types of diodes 
 
The PN junctions with additional features are called special types of diodes, which have 
special form of PN junction compared to normal diodes. Most of the special diodes converts one 
form of energy into another form, few of them are discussed in the following section. 
 
 
 
1. Photodiodes: 
 
Photo diodes are special type of diode or special form of PN junction, which conducts or 
produces current when the junction is exposed to light radiation under reverse biasing condition. 
I.e., photo diodes converts light radiation into electrical energy. If the radiation increases, the 
current produced by the device also increases. 
 
Circuit symbol and realistic view of photodiode: 
                       
 
The pair of inward arrow indicates that, the device starts conducting, when the device receives 
light radiation. 
 
Internal structure with biasing arrangement:

Page 25 
 
 
Figure shows the internal structure of the photodiode, these types of diodes are surrounded by a 
glass surface to allow the radiation into the junction. V is the voltage supply for biasing the device 
in reverse biasing mode. Ammeter connected in series with the device to read the current produced 
by the device. Photo diodes will work in two modes  
i) Photovoltaic (Solar cells) : Under un-biasing condition, when the junction exposed to radiation, 
the device will produces current is called photovoltaic mode of operation of photodiode. Example: 
Solar cells. 
ii) Photoconductive (Photo diode): The device is under reverse biasing and the junction exposed 
to radiation, produces current. This mode of operation is called photoconductive mode. 
 
Working principle: 
 
Under reverse biasing the depletion region increases and immobile ions accumulates near 
the junction on both sides, which acts as a barrier and avoids further movement of charge carriers 
from one region to another region. When the junction is exposed to light radiation, the junction 
takes sufficient energy to break the covalent bonds. The covalent bonds breaks and generates free 
electrons, due to the movement of these free electrons, current will be flowing through the device. 
 
VI Characteristics: 
 
Figure shows the VI characteristics of a photodiode, which is a plot of reverse voltage vs 
current through the device with constant and different light intensities. If the device under reverse 
biasing and does not exposed to radiation, only small current will flow through the device due to 
minority charge carriers, this current is called dark current. If the light intensity increases, the 
current through the device increases.

2. Light emitting diode (LED): 
 
Light emitting diode is a special type of diode or special form of PN junction, which converts 
electrical energy into light energy under forward biasing. The reverse bias operation of LEDs is 
avoided due to very low breakdown voltage. 
 
Circuit symbol and realistic view of LED: 
 
The pair of outward arrows, indicates when the device conducts, which emits visible light. 
 
Internal structure with biasing arrangement and working: 
 
Figure, shows the internal structure and biasing arrangement of light emitting diode, these 
types of diodes are surrounded by a transparent plastic hard epoxy hemisphere cell to protect the 
device from the external shock and to emit the visible light in different colors. 
 
 
 
 
V is the voltage supply for biasing the device in forward biasing mode. Energy gap must be greater 
than 1.8eV in order to emit the visible light. The device needs some energy to move the free 
electrons from valence band to conduction band and during the recombination, electrons releases 
approximately same amount of energy, if the released energy in the form of photon. 
Energy of photon is the product of plank’s constant and frequency of radiated electromagnetic 
wave. 
i.e., 𝐸𝑔= ℎ𝑓−−−(1) 
𝑤. 𝑘. 𝑡. , 𝑓= 𝑐
𝜆−−−(2) 
Where, c is the velocity of light and 𝜆 is the wavelength of electromagnetic wave. 
 
From the equations (1) and (2), we get, 
𝐸𝑔 𝛼1
𝜆−−−(3) 

Basic Electronics [18EC14/24] 
 
Prepared by Mohankumar V., Assistant Professor, Dept. of ECE, Dr.AIT 
Page 27 
 
i.e., energy of a photon is directly proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to 
wavelength, if the energy gap increases, LEDs emit electromagnetic waves of different 
wavelength(different colors).  
 
If the energy gap is less than 1.8eV, electrons releases energy in the form of infra-red radiation, 
which is not visible to human eyes. If the energy gap is greater than or equal to 1.8eV, during the 
recombination process, which releases energy in the form of light, which are visible to human eye.  
Ge and Si are not suitable elements to produce visible light signals, so compounded semiconductor 
materials like gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide, gallium nitride, gallium arsenide phosphide 
etc…are used to develop light emitting diodes. The cut-in voltage of LEDs ranges from 1.2V to 
4V. 
 
VI Characteristics: 
 
Figure shows the VI characteristics of an LED, which is a plot of forward voltage vs current 
through the device. 
  
 
Applications: 
• 
Traffic signal lamps 
• 
Medical devices 
• 
Camera flash lights etc. 
 
3. Photocoupler: 
 
Also called as optocoupler or optoisolator, acts as an interface between two different circuits 
with different voltage levels. These devices supplies electrical isolation between input and output 
source.  
 
Photocouplers are composed of two semiconductor devices, namely light emitting diode and 
photo-transistor. The photocouplers receives electrical signal as an input from the source and 
emits light, photo-transistor receives the light signal and converts back into electrical signal.  
Figure shows the working principle of optocouplers.

capacitors are required for the input and output. 
• 
Low cost - these linear voltage regulators can be obtained for a very low cost. 
 
NOTE: 79XX series voltage regulators are similar to 78XX series regulators, but 79XX series 
regulators provides negative voltage.

Chapter-1: Bipolar Junction Transistor. 
 
Introduction:  
Electronic systems are interconnection or combination of electronic devices and electrical 
elements. Electrical elements in the electronic systems are used to bias the electronic devices. 
Semiconductor devices such as diodes and transistors are called electronic devices. Electronic 
devices are used for switching and amplification purpose. Diodes are used for switching 
applications and they are not having the capability of amplifying the signals. Therefore diodes are 
limited to switching applications.  
The transistor is a three-terminal device that can amplify the signals as well as performing 
switching action.  
The term transistor is derived from the statement transfer of resistor that is a transistor 
will transfers the resistance from one junction to another junction through proper biasing. Hence, 
transistors perform amplification by changing their resistance. 
 
Transistor 
Transfer of Resistor 
 
 The first transistor was demonstrated on 23rd Dec 1947, by Dr. Willian Shockley and his 
team at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, USA 
The important features of transistors compared to vacuum tubes are listed as follows. 
1. Three terminal solid-state device 
2. Smaller and lightweight 
3. Rugged construction 
4. No heater requirement 
5. Requires less power 
6. Lower operating voltage and  
7. More efficient. 
With these advantages, transistors are developed and used in all electronic systems as a 
switch and/or amplifier.

Step1: start with a piece of intrinsic semiconductor and divided it into three regions 
 
Figure 4: Piece of intrinsic semiconductor  
Step2: Three regions are doped to form NPN regions 
 
 
Figure 5: Doped intrinsic semiconductor  
 
Doping with pentavalent element gives N-type material and doping with trivalent element gives 
P-type semiconductor material. 
 
Step3: Metallic contacts are deposited at each layer to connect the electrodes to form terminals 
 
Figure 6: Electrodes connected to each layer  
 
Step4: Terminals are named as Emitter, Base, and Collector 
 
Figure 7: Terminals are named as emitter, base, and collector 
 
The emitter terminal emits more electrons and hence, the emitter region is doped heavily, 
Collector terminal collects the emitted electrons, hence the width of the collector region is high.

The base terminal is a lightly doped and thin region, which controls the electrons flow from 
emitter to collector. 
 
Working Principle: 
The BJTs are working under three different modes, such as cut-off, saturation and active modes 
and the working principle of NPN-BJT is explained with these three modes. 
Case (i): Cut-off mode 
• 
Both Emitter-Base and Collector-Base junctions are reverse biased 
• 
The depletion region widens at both the junctions and no current will flow through the 
device. 
• 
Acts as an OFF switch 
 
Figure 8: Cut-off mode operation of BJT  
 
Case (ii): Saturation Mode 
• 
Both Emitter-Base and Collector-Base junctions are forward biased 
• 
The depletion region reduces at both the junctions and maximum current will flow 
through the device. 
• 
Acts as an ON switch. 
 
Figure 8: Saturation mode operation of BJT  
 
Case (iii): Active Mode 
• 
Emitter-Base Junction is forward biased and Collector-Base junction is reverse biased 
• 
The width of the depletion region decreases at EB Junction. 
• 
Width of the depletion region Increases at CB Junction. 
• 
Electrons move through the base region, but the base region is lightly doped and only a 
few electrons recombine with the holes present in the base region, remaining electrons are 
drifted towards the collector region and constitute a collector current. 
• 
Only 2-5% of electrons recombine at the base region, remaining 95 to 98% electrons move 
to the collector region 
• 
Transfer of resistance takes place, hence it is called the transistor. 
• 
Acts as an amplifier

Characteristics of BJT: 
 
Bipolar junction transistor is a three-terminal device and BJTs are need to be modeled as 
a two-port network. A pair of terminals is called a port, the two-port network means, the network 
has two pairs of terminals. One pair of terminals used to apply the input and another pair of 
terminals is used to take the corresponding output. Figure (9) shows the block diagram of two-
port model. 
 
 
Figure 9: Two-port model 
 
 One terminal of BJT can be connected to the ground or made common to both input and 
output to form a two-port model, which leads to three different configurations they are. 
 
1. Common Base (CB) Configuration 
2. Common Emitter (CE) Configuration and  
3. Common Collector (CC) Configuration. 
 
Each of these configurations is having its advantages and disadvantages. To study the behavior of 
these configurations, VI characteristics need to be obtained, VI Characteristics of BJTs are divided 
into two types they are.  
 
1. Input characteristics and 
2. Output characteristics

Input Characteristics: 
 
• 
VEB vs IE with zero or constant VCB 
• 
Initially, the collector-base voltage VCB is kept at zero, and emitter current IE is increased 
from zero by increasing VEB. 
• 
The EB junction depletion region reduces by increasing VEB and if VEB is greater than or 
equal to cut-in voltage, current starts increasing. 
• 
This characteristic is similar to the forward bias characteristics of the diode.  
• 
Effect of VCB: If VCB is increased, the depletion region of the CB junction increases and 
the depletion region penetrates deeper into the base region, which leads to a decrease in 
the width of the based region, so emitter current increases. This effect is called early 
effect or based width modulation.

• 
If IE is zero, and CB junction reverse-biased, a small current will flow through the device. 
This current is called reverse leakage current, denoted as ICBO. 
• 
If IE increases by increasing VEB, the emitter terminal injects more electrons and less 
recombination takes place at the base region due to early effect, and hence collector 
current increases proportionally to emitter current.

Transistor DC Load line analysis 
 
Applying DC voltage of proper magnitude and polarity at the two junctions without AC 
signal is called DC biasing. When the BJT is biased, it will establish certain current and voltage 
conditions, these conditions are called operating conditions of the transistor. 
In Common emitter configuration, collector to emitter voltage (VCE) and collector current(IC) 
are Operating conditions, these operating conditions are also called as DC operating point or 
quiescent point or simply Q-point. This operating point must be stable for the proper operation 
of the transistor. 
 
Q point will be written in the following format: Q (VCE, IC)  
 
In the following section, finding the Q point for CE configuration is explained. 
Consider a BJT in common emitter configuration, Base-emitter junction is biased for the forward 
bias and Collector-base junction is biased for reverse bias. Resistors are connected through the 
base and collector terminals for biasing the device with proper magnitudes.

Figure 22: DC biasing of CE configuration NPN-BJT 
 
The value of the collector current and emitter current at any time will satisfy  
𝑉𝐶𝐶= 𝐼𝐶𝑅𝐶+ 𝑉𝐶𝐸−−−(1) 
If 𝑉𝐶𝐸= 0, 
 𝐈𝐂(𝐦𝐚𝐱) =
𝐕𝐂𝐂
𝐑𝐂−−−(𝟐) 
i.e., the collector current is maximum at zero collector-emitter voltage, denote this point as A. 
If 𝐼𝐶 = 0,  
𝐕𝐂𝐄(𝐦𝐚𝐱) = 𝐕𝐂𝐂−−−(𝟑) 
i.e., the voltage across collector and emitter terminals is maximum, if collector current is zero, 
denote this point as B. 
 
By locating the points A and B on output characteristics of common emitter configuration BJT, 
and joining the points gives DC load line. The intersection of the output characteristic curve and 
DC load line gives the operating point of the transistor. As shown in figure (23). 
 
 
Figure 23: DC load line 
 
The Q point must be at the middle of the active region for perfect amplification if the Q point 
moves towards the x-axis, the transistor will operate in cur-off mode and if the Q point moves 
towards the Y-axis, then the transistor will operate in saturation mode. The slope of the DC load 
line is
1
𝑅𝐶. 
 
NOTE:  
 
1. The leakage current, ICBO greatly affected by temperature variations. The collector to base 
leakage current doubles for every 10oC rise in temperature.

And,

Collector current depends on ICBO which is the temperature-dependent quantity and hence, the Q 
point may shift towards saturation or cut-off region, leads to unexpected behavior and response 
from the system. This process is termed as a thermal run-away, i.e., destruction of Q point due 
to temperature variations is called thermal run-away. So, proper biasing is necessary to maintain 
the location of the Q point constantly. 
Also, VBE is a temperature-dependent variable, which decreases by 2.5mV for every 1oC rise in 
temperature. 
 
2. The Q point also depends on the value of β, β is a highly sensitive factor, and small changes in 
the input current lead to very high changes at the output (Collector current and collector to emitter 
voltage). So, proper biasing is necessary to maintain the location of Q point constantly. 
i.e., 
∆𝐼𝐶= 𝛽∆𝐼𝐵−−−(7) 
 
 
3. Location of the Q point and its corresponding response.

Transistor as an amplifier: 
 
Amplifier is an electronic circuit, which increases the strength of the weak signal, in 
otherward amplifier is an electronic circuit, which increases the amplitude of the input (current 
or voltage or both) signal. 
Common emitter configuration of BJT is best suitable for amplification purpose, because 
common collector configuration can amplify both voltage as wells as current. 
Consider a common emitter configured BJT with simple biasing method, shown in figure 
(27). RB is the base resistor and RC is the collector resistor which is to be properly chosen to 
maintain the location of the Q point in the middle of the active region for zero signal. 
 
Figure 27: Transistor amplifier circuit. 
 
When an ac signal is applied across the base to emitter terminal, that signal superimposed 
with the DC base current. The small change in base current ∆𝐼𝑏 provides a very high change in 
collector current∆𝐼𝑐, because of large𝛽.

RC decides the transistor to work in saturation and cu-off region with respect to VBB. The switching 
action of transistor is discussed as follows. 
 
Case (i): Cut-off 
If VBB=0, based current is zero and hence collector current through the transistor is zero lead to 
collector to emitter voltage is equal to the applied voltage VCC, hence the terminals collector and 
emitter acts as an open circuit called OFF switch.

Case (ii): Saturation 
When positive voltage of sufficient magnitude applied across the base terminal, base to emitter 
junction conducts and sufficient base current will drive the transistor to saturation region and 
maximum collector current flows through the device. Hence, the collector to emitter terminal acts 
as a short circuit and called ON switch.

Chapter-2: Feedback amplifier. 
 
Feedback is a process/technique where a portion of the output signal of a system is fed back 
and recombined with the input. 
• 
Feedback is used in all amplifier circuits. 
• 
Some circuits virtually acts as a feedback in electronic systems and also can be introduced 
externally for some amplifiers. 
• 
Invented in the year 1928 by Harold black, engineer, Western electric company. 
 
Figure (1) shows the canonical form representation of a feedback system, block AOL is the 
amplifier with gain A or AOL and block β is the feedback network with gain β. 
 
Figure 1: Canonical for representation of feedback system 
 
Based on the way of combining the signals at input, feedback systems are classified into: 
• 
Positive feedback 
• 
Negative feedback 
 
Positive Feedback: 
• 
Positive feedback is a process of adding the portion of the output with the input and 
amplifying. This process is continuous and regenerative action takes place shown in 
figure (2). 
 
Figure 2: Canonical for representation of positive feedback system 
 
Though the positive feedback increases the gain of the amplifier, it has the disadvantages such 
as 
• 
Increasing distortion 
• 
Instability 
 
NOTE: Positive feedback is mainly used in the design of oscillators.

Negative Feedback: 
 Negative feedback is a process of subtracting the portion of the output with the input and 
amplifying. This process is continuous and degenerative action takes place shown in figure (3).

 Increases the input impedance 
 Decreases the output impedance 
 Bandwidth increases 
 Increases upper cut-off frequency 
 Decreases the lower cut-off frequency

 Reduction in noise 
 
Disadvantage:  
 Decreases the gain

Circuit diagram 
  
Figure 5: Circuit diagram of RC phase shift oscillator 
 
Figure (5) shows the circuit diagram of the RC phase shift oscillator. BJT CE configuration 
is biased with voltage divider biasing technique using the resistors R1 and R2. RC and RE are 
collector and emitter resistors. CC is a coupling capacitor that isolates the DC biasing settings and 
CE is the bypass capacitor to avoid decreasing the output voltage by acting low resistance path 
across RE under ac signal.  
Further, three stages of the RC network are connected between the output terminal to the 
input terminal as a feedback circuit and this feedback circuit acts as a frequency selective network. 
Three stages of RC networks provide a constant attenuation factor of 1/29 (β) and an amplifier 
circuit should be designed to provide an amplification factor of 29(A), which satisfies the first 
condition of Barkhausen’s criterion. Also, each RC stage is designed to provide a 60o phase shift, 
so three stages of the RC network provide a 180o phase shift and the BJT amplifier produces a 
180o phase shift. Hence, the total phase shift around a loop is 360o or 0o, which is the second 
condition of Barkhausen’s criterion. Equation (1) is the expression of frequency of generated 
sinusoidal oscillations and figure (6) shows the waveform of generated oscillations.

from the source terminal to the drain terminal and will be controlled by the gate terminal. If the 
volume of the water in the tank is more,  water movement will be faster, and more could be 
collected at the sink, similarly if the drain to source voltage increases, more electrons will drift 
from the source terminal to the drain terminal and causes a conventional current from drain to 
the source terminal, called as drain current. 
 
Now consider a rotating knob of tap, that will be rotated to block the flow of water, but 
assume that it does not block completely. And due to more pressure of water flow from the tank, 
there should be a constant amount of water will flow. If the further increasing the pressure of 
water flow from the tank, the controlling element in a tap is going to damage, and more current 
will flow. 
 
Similarly in JFET, if the pinch-off condition occurs, the constant current will flow from 
drain to source, which is due to the increase in drifting of electrons towards the drain terminal or 
due to high current density (conventional current will flow in opposite direction to the movement 
of 
the 
electrons). 
This 
occurs 
at  
VDS=VP (Pinch-off Voltage). If VDS>|VVBD|, Junction will break and the device will get damaged. 
1.4. N-Channel JFET. 
 
In the N-channel Junction field-effect transistor, N-type material is the major part and 
the electrons are majority charge carriers, the current conduction takes place by these majority 
charge carriers.

1.4.1. Construction: 
 
Starting with a large piece of N-type semiconductor material, it acts as a channel and two 
small pieces of P-type Semiconductor materials are embedded in the two sides of the N-type 
material, forming two PN Junctions shown in figure 1.2. The Major portion in the structure is the 
N-type semiconductor material and it is between the two P-type semiconductor materials that 
create an N-channel, hence called as N-Channel JFET. 
 
Figure 1.2: Structure of the N-Channel JFET. 
 
The metallic contacts are deposited on the sides of the structure to connect the electrodes. 
The upper electrode is denoted as D and it is called as Drain terminal, the bottom electrode is 
denoted as S and it is called as Source terminal, the other two sides are internally connected and 
denoted as G and it is called as Gate terminal, shown in figure 1.2. 
 
The N-Channel is having electrons that are majority charge carriers and holes are minority 
charge carriers, similarly, P-type materials are having holes that are majority charge carriers and 
electrons are minority charge carriers. Under normal room temperature, without bias, the 
electrons from the channel tend to move from N-type to P-type and vice-versa creates a small 
depletion region shown in figure 1.2. 
1.4.2. Working Principle: 
 
The working of N-Channel JFET will be discussed in two cases, as follows. 
Case I: VGS=0( Zero Gate Biasing) and VDS>0V(Positive Voltage). 
Case II: VGS<0(Negative Biasing) and VDS>0V(Positive Voltage). 
 
1.4.2.1. Case I: VGS=0( Zero Gate Biasing) and VDS>0V(Positive Voltage).

The N-Channel JFET is Biased with a positive voltage between Drain to Source and Zero 
Biasing between Gate to source as shown in figure 1.3. 
 
Figure 1.3. Under Positive Drain voltage and zero gate voltage. 
 
By increasing the Positive voltage VDD, the depletion region increases in the form of wedge 
shape shown in figure 1.3., because the PN Junction near the Drain terminal is reverse biasing 
and near the source terminal is forward biasing, hence the depletion region near the drain 
terminal is more compared to near the source terminal.  
 
The shape of the depletion region is further explained in detail with the following analogy. 
The channel is like a resistor and considers there are five equal valued resistors are connected in 
series between drain to source shown in figure 1.4., suppose the applied voltage is 5 Volts, the 
voltage drop across each resistor is 1V. 
 
With respect to A, the voltage is 1V, at B 2V, at C 3V, and at D 4V, i.e., the Positive voltage 
at D is more positive than C, at C is more Positive than B, and so on. Hence the width of the 
depletion region is more near the drain terminal compared to the Source.

Figure 1.4. Showing Analogy for Channel. 
 
If VDD is increasing, the area and width of the channel decreases, hence less drain current 
will flow through the channel from drain to source, if VDD is further increased to a level, which 
touches both the depletion regions(not overlapping) and it is called Pinch-Off. The 
voltage(positive voltage applied between drain to source) at which, the depletion regions are going 
to the Pinch-off condition, is called Pinch-off voltage shown in figure 1.5. 
 
Figure 1.5. Pinch off condition 
 
At Pinch-off condition, the constant current will flow from drain to source, because at 
pinch-off the depletion regions will touch but it will not create a barrier to move electrons from 
source to drain, and also due to high current density.  
The output characteristic of N-Channel JFET is shown in figure 1.7.

Figure 1.7. Output characteristics of N-channel JFET, with VGS=0 and VDS>0V. 
1.4.2.2. Case II: VGS<0(Reverse Biasing) and VDS>0V (Positive Voltage). 
 
The N-channel JFET's drain terminal is biased with positive voltage i.e. VDS=+ve, and the 
gate terminal is biased with negative voltage i.e., VGS=-Ve, shown in figure 1.8. In this case, the 
pinch-off condition occurs quite earlier and is decided by the negative potential applied at the gate 
i.e. more negative the VGS, earlier the pinch-off, reducing IDSS shown in the output characteristics, 
refer figure 1.9. As the phenomenon continues, it is seen that a condition arises wherein the 
saturation level of the drain-to-source current occurs right for a value of 0 mA. This means the 
current doesn’t flow through the device and essentially the device will turn OFF. The value of VDS 
for which this happens will be nothing but the negative pinch-off voltage i.e. VDS = -VP.

2. SCRs:  
SCR is an acronym for Silicon Controlled Rectifier. 
 
The device which converts ac to dc or the device which conducts current only in the 
forward direction is called rectifier/Diode.  
 
If the diode is made up of silicon material, then the diode is called a silicon diode/silicon 
rectifier. The silicon material is used instead of Germanium because of the requirement of 
high temperature to handle high currents and power. 
 
If the silicon diode is controllable, then the device is called a silicon-controlled 
diode/silicon-controlled rectifier. 
Hence, the SCRs are defined as the devices which conduct current in the forward direction and 
also controllable and are made up of using silicon material. These devices have three junctions, 
three terminals, and four layers. 
2.1. Basic Structure of SCR. 
 
The basic Structure of SCR is shown in figure 2.1, which consisting of four layers, its four 
layers are arranged as PNPN. The outer layers are connected to terminals to form a positive 
terminal called an Anode, a Negative terminal called a Cathode, and a terminal from P-Layer 
nearer to the cathode called a Gate.

2.2. Circuit symbol. 
The circuit symbol of SCR is shown in figure 2.2, the terminals anode, cathode, and gate are 
shown. IA is Anode Current, IG is the gate current, which is applying to control the anode current 
during the forward bias.  
 
Figure 2.2: Circuit Symbol of SCR. 
2.3. Working Principle. 
 
Silicon Controlled Rectifiers begin their conduction during the forward bias, the forward 
biasing arrangement shown in figure 2.3. That is Positive terminal of the battery is connected to 
the anode terminal and the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the cathode terminal. 
The working principle of SCRs can be analyzed using two cases. 
Case I: Without Gate signal(VG=0 and VAA>0). 
Case II: With Gate signal(VG>0 and VAA>0). 
2.3.1. Case I: Without gate signal(VG=0) and VAA>0. 
 
When the SCR is under forward biasing and without the gate signal, as shown in figure 
2.3. The junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased and J2 is reverse biased. Hence conduction path 
does not exist. During this condition, the device acts as an open circuit even under forward 
biasing.

Figure 2.3: Forward Biasing of SCR without Gate Signal. 
2.3.2. Case II: With Gate signal(VG>0) and VAA>0. 
 
When a gate signal(Generally positive Clock Pulse) is applied along with forward biasing 
of SCR shown in figure 2.4. The gate current IG(sufficiently large enough to drive the device) flows 
into the gate terminal and hence the junction J2 gets forward biased along with J1 and J2, then the 
device goes to conduction mode and the current will flow from anode to cathode terminal. During 
this condition, the device acts as a short circuit/ON switch. 
The silicon-controlled rectifiers, forward current offers a very low resistance of 0.01 to 0.1Ω, 
whereas it offers infinite resistance under non-conduction mode.  
 
Figure 2.4: Forward Biasing of SCR with Gate Signal. 
 
During forward biasing and with gate signal, all the junctions J1, J2, and J3 are forward 
biased and regenerative action takes place. Because of regenerative action, even after removing 
the gate current, the device will not be turned off. Hence, an External circuitry/Commutation 
process is used to turn off the SCRs.

The two-transistor model of SCR is shown in figure 2.5. The four layers of SCR are divided 
into two transistors by subdividing the middle N and P Layers. The cross-sectional view of SCR is 
shown in figure 2.5(a) and the equivalent circuit using BJT symbols is shown in figure 2.5(b). 
 
Figure 2.5(a): Cross sectional view. Figure 2.5(b): Transistor equivalent circuit. 
Figure 2.5: Two Transistor model of SCR. 
 
From the above diagrams, it is observed that the four layers of SCR are comprised of two 
transistors, one NPN and another PNP. As there is electrical continuity between the two

transistors, the base of the T1 is connected to the Collector of T2; and the collector of T1 is connected 
to the base of T2 is shown in figure 2.5b. 
2.4.1. Switching action 
Case-I: Without gate signal(VG=0) and VAA>0. 
 
Gate(C1/B2) and Cathode(E2) are connected to the ground terminal, i.e., the zero gate bias. 
Let a positive voltage VAA be applied to the anode(E1). With VG=0, the VBE2=0 so, the CB junction 
of T2 is reverse biased, and only leakage current(ICO) will be supplied to the base of T1. It is too 
small to turn on the transistor T1. Thus both T1and T2 are in the off state. Refer to figure 2.6. 
 
Figure 2.6: Showing Working principle of SCR under VG=0. 
so anode current is given by, IA=IB1=ICO is of negligible quantity. That is SCR is in the turn-off 
state. means SCR acts as an Open Circuit or Open Switch. 
Case-II: With Gate signal(VG>0 ) and VAA>0. 
Let a Positive voltage VG be applied at the gate terminal(C1/B2). As VBE2=VG, and on making VG 
sufficiently large, IB2 will cause T2 to turn on and the collector current IC2 becomes large. As IB1=IC2, 
T1 turns on causing a large collector current IC1(IA=IC1) to flow. This in turn increases IB2 causing a 
regenerative action to set in  (this is indeed positive internal feedback). Refer to figure 2.7.

Figure 2.7: Showing Working principle of SCR under VG>0. 
so anode current is given by, IA=IE1=IE2 is of maximum current. that is SCR is led to turn-on. i.e., 
SCR acts as a short circuit or closed switch. 
2.4.2. Commutation. 
As observed from the switching action of SCR, once the SCR is turned on, due to regenerative 
action, the SCR always remains in ON condition, thus Commutation circuits/mechanisms are 
required to turn off the SCR. 
Commutation is a process of turn-off the SCR, there are two types of commutation  
 
Natural Commutation 
 
Forced Commutation. 
2.4.2.1. Natural Commutation. 
The AC signal is fed to the SCR, when the signal passes through zero shown in figure 2.8, the 
current becomes zero, in that situation the SCR turns off naturally. This type of turning off the 
SCR is called natural commutation and also called line commutation. 
 
Figure 2.8: Signal Passes through Zero.

Prepared by Mohankumar V., Assistant Professor, Dept. of ECE, Dr.AIT 
Page 73 
 
2.4.2.2. Forced Commutation. 
 
Forced commutation is a process of turn-off the SCR, through an external circuit. In this 
case, the current through the SCR is forced to become zero by passing a current through it in 
opposite direction from the external circuit. 
 
There are many types of forced commutation, in the present context, a simple series 
combination of the transistor and a dc battery is discussed to turn off the SCR as shown in figure 
2.9. 
 
To turn off the SCR, a positive IB pulse of magnitude, large enough to drive the transistor 
into the saturation level is applied at the transistor base. the transistor acts as a short circuit. This 
causes the flow of very large Ioff through the SCR in opposite direction to its conduction current. 
The total SCR current reduces to zero in a very short time causing SCR to turn off. 
Turn off time of an SCR is typically 5-30µs. 
 
Figure 2.9: Turn-off Circuit 
2.5 SCR Characteristics. 
 
when the positive voltage VAK=VF is applied between Anode to the cathode. Without a gate 
signal, a small leakage current will flow from anode to cathode due to minority charge carriers, 
which is negligibly small and considered as an OFF state. The voltage drop across the SCR is the 
same as the applied voltage, during the OFF state. 
 
When a gate pulse is applied, the SCR will turn on, once the SCR turns on the voltage 
across the SCR i.e., VAK drops to the threshold voltage level(Vt=0.7V, because Silicon controlled 
rectifier) and current suddenly increases. Further increase in VF causes an increase in IA but 
Voltage remains constant. The Plot of VAK vs IA is shown in figure 2.10 for different values of IG. 
If the forward break-over voltage VF is small, more gate current is required to trigger the SCR. 
The SCRs will trigger even without a gate signal if the voltage across the SCR exceeds VBD(Break 
down voltage, practically very high voltage level).

2.5.1. Terminologies used in SCR and its characteristics. 
a. Forward break-over voltage(VF) 
Forward break-over voltage is the voltage at which for a given IG, the SCR enters into 
conduction mode. This voltage reduces as IG increases. 
b. Holding Current(IH) 
Holding current is the value of the current below which SCR switches from conduction mode to 
forward blocking mode(OFF mode). 
c. Forward and Reverse blocking  
Forward and Reverse blocking regions are those regions in which the SCR is open-circuited and 
no current flows from anode to cathode. 
d. Latching current(IL) 
Latching current is the minimum anode current above which gate losses its control.

UNIT IV: Operational Amplifiers and Digital Electronics. 
 
Chapter-1: Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps). 
 
1.1. Introduction 
 
 
The operational amplifier in short Op-Amp is a linear Integrated circuit, also called a differential 
amplifier.  Op-Amp is a linear and active device, which performs various operations like, signal 
conditioning, filtering, addition, subtraction, integration, differentiation, etc...  
 
 
Op-amps are voltage amplifiers designed to be used with feedback circuits, using the elements 
Resistors or capacitors. The feedback elements determine the operation of the op-amps. 
 
 
Op-Amps have three terminals, two input terminals named Inverting input terminal, Non-
Inverting input terminal, and one output terminal. The op-Amp performs the amplification of the difference 
of the two input signals through +VCC and -VEE DC biasing power supply. Hence the name differential 
amplifier, shown in figure(1).  
 
1.2. Circuit Symbol of an Op-Amp:

Page 76 
 
i) Infinite Voltage Gain/loop gain 
 
Voltage gain is the ratio of output voltage to the input voltage. 
i.e., Av =
Vout
Vin  
 
NOTE: Ideally ∞, typically 2x105. 
ii) Infinite input impedance 
  
Input impedance is the ratio of input voltage to the input current, an Op-amp, the input current is 
zero., Hence, the Input impedance is infinite. 
i.e., Zi =
Vin
Iin 
NOTE: Ideally ∞, typically 1MΩ-2 MΩ. 
iii) Zero output Impedance 
 
Output impedance is the ratio of output voltage to the output current, in op-amp output current is 
maximum. Hence, the output impedance is zero. 
i.e., Zo =
Vout
Iout 
NOTE: Ideally 0, typically 50-75 Ω. 
iv) Infinite Bandwidth 
 
 
An op-amp has an infinite frequency response and can amplify the signal from DC to the highest 
frequencies. 
NOTE: Ideally ∞, typically few GHz. 
 
v) Infinite Common Mode Rejection Ratio(CMRR) 
 
CMRR is the ratio of differential gain to the common-mode gain., Common-mode gain is the 
difference of the two input signals is zero. If Common mode voltage gain is zero, the CMRR is infinite. 
i.e., CMRR =
AD
ACM 
ACM = Vinv −Vnon−inv ≈0 
NOTE: Ideally ∞, typically  70-90dB. 
vi) Zero Slew rate 
 
Slew rate is the rate of change of output voltage, which tells how fast the system responds to the 
change in the input signal. 
 
i.e., Slew Rate =
dVout
dt  
 
NOTE: Ideally 0, typically 0.5V/µsecs. 
vii) Infinite Power supply rejection ratio(PSRR) 
 
The ratio of change in output voltage to change in supply voltage(due to ac ripples) is called the 
Power supply rejection ratio. 
i.e, PSRR =
∆Vout
∆Vin  
NOTE: Ideally ∞,, typically 50-100dB 
 
viii) Input Bias Currents:   
 
The current flowing through the base terminals of the input stage transistors circuit of an op-amp 
is called input bias currents, denoted as IB1 and IB2. 
 
NOTE: Ideally 0A, typically 80nA and maximum 500nA. 
 
ix) Input offset current: 
 
The magnitude of the difference between the input bias currents is called Input offset current, 
denoted as Iio. 
i.e., Iio = |IB2 −IB1| 
 
NOTE: Ideally 0A, typically 20nA, and maximum 200nA. 
 
x) Input offset voltage: 
 
Op-amp produces zero output voltage for zero input voltage, but practically a small dc voltage 
appears across the output terminal of an op-amp even if the input is zero, that voltage is called input offset 
voltage, denoted as Vio. 
 
NOTE: Ideally 0V, typically 1mV, and maximum 5mV.

NOTE: The typical values given in the above characteristics are related to µA741. 
 
 
 
1.5. Concept of Virtual ground 
 
 
 
Op-amp is a differential amplifier, which amplifies the difference between the two input signals. 
i.e., Vout = A(V2 −V1) 
We know that, the ideally A=∞. 
Therefore,  Vnon−inv −Vinv = 0 
or 
Vnon−inv = Vinv 
 
From the above equation, observed that the inverting terminal voltage is the same as the non-
inverting terminal voltage. i.e., if one of the input terminals is connected to ground(zero potential), the 
other terminal voltage is also zero, which indicates that there are virtually short-circuited. In other words, 
a node that has zero potential with respect to the ground but is not connected to the ground. This concept 
is called virtual ground. 
 
  
1.6. Applications of Op-amps 
 
In this section, the linear applications of op-amp have been discussed. 
 
1.6.1. Inverting amplifier 
 
An electronic circuit or device, which increases the strength of the input signal and the output signal 
is 180o out phase with the input signal is called inverting amplifier. Figure(3) shows the circuit diagram of 
the op-amp inverting amplifier.

The input signal is applied to the inverting terminal through R1 and the non-inverting terminal is 
connected to the ground, RF is the feedback(Negative feedback) resistor connected from the output 
terminal to the input terminal.

From equation (5), it has been observed that the output signal is RF/Rin times that of the input signal with 
a negative sign indicates phase reversal.

1.6.2. Non-Inverting amplifier 
 
An electronic circuit or device, which increases the strength of the input signal and the output signal 
is in phase with the input signal is called a non-inverting amplifier. Figure(4) shows the circuit diagram of 
the op-amp non-inverting amplifier.

Rin −−−−−(12) 
 
 
1.6.3. Op-Amp summing amplifier 
 
An electronic circuit or device, which amplifies the summation of two or more signals is called a 
summing amplifier. Figure(5) shows the circuit diagram of the op-amp summing amplifier for three inputs.

1.7. Wein Bridge Oscillator using Op-Amp 
 
 
An electronic circuit that generates oscillations without oscillating input signal, such circuits are 
called oscillators. Wein bridge oscillator is a low frequency and type of RC oscillator, the resistors are 
connected in the form of Wein bridge, Hence the name Wein bridge oscillator. Figure (10) shows the circuit 
diagram of the Wein bridge oscillator. 
 
 
 
Figure 10: Wein Bridge oscillator 
 
 
The output signal of the amplifier is fed back to the input through terminals 1 and 3 of the feedback 
network. Input to the amplifier stage is supplied from terminals 2 and 4 of the feedback network. Hence 
the amplifier output becomes the input voltage of the bridge whilst the output of the bridge becomes 
the input voltage of the amplifier. When the bridge is balanced the input voltage to the amplifier 
becomes zero, to produce the sustained oscillations input to the amplifier must be non-vanishing. 
Therefore the bridge is unbalanced by adjusting the proper values of the resistors. The RC network is 
responsible for determining the frequency of the oscillator.

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital systems, it is an electronic circuits, which produces 
one output by taking one or more inputs. The relation between output to input/s are based on certain logic, 
the logic operations are named as AND, OR, NOT etc.. 
 
Logic gates are classified into two types. 
 
i. Basic Gates 
 
The logic gates which performs the basic operations, such as AND, OR and NOT are called basic 
gates. 
a. AND gate 
b. OR gate 
c. NOT gate 
 these gates are explained as follows. 
 
a. AND gate: 
 
A logic gate, which performs logical AND operation is called AND gate. AND gates are having 
multiple input and single output. These gates produces logical value one, if all the inputs are one's else 
output is zero. Two inputs and single output gate is explained as follows.

Figure: Switching Equivalent circuit 
 
Explanation: 
 
 
Figure shows the switching equivalent circuit of logical AND gate, which consisting of Voltage 
supply and series connected of two switches along with a bulb. Switches are considered as inputs A and B. 
case(i): If A=0 and B=0, i.e., two switches are in open state, the complete circuit is open circuit. Hence 
current will not flow through the circuit and energy will not be supplied to bulb, so the bulb will not glow. 
Hence, output Y=0. 
case(ii): If A=0 and B=1, i.e., Switch A is open and Switch B is closed, the complete circuit is open circuited. 
hence current will not flow through the circuit and energy will not be supplied to  the bulb, so the bulb will 
not glow. Hence, output Y=0. 
case(iii): If A=1 and B=0, i.e., Switch A is Closed and Switch B is Open, the complete circuit is open circuited. 
hence current will not flow through the circuit and energy will not be supplied to  the bulb so the bulb will 
not glow. Hence, output Y=0. 
case(iv): If A=1 and B=1, i.e., two switches are in closed state, current will flow through the circuit and 
energy will supply to the bulb, so the bulb will glow. Hence, output Y=1. 
 
b. OR gate: 
 
 
 
A logic gate, which performs logical OR operation is called OR gate. OR gates are having multiple 
input and single output. These gates produces logical value one, if any one of the input is logical one, if all 
the input are zero's then the output is zero. Two inputs and single output gate is explained as follows.

case(i): If A=0, i.e., Switch A is open and the circuit is closed. hence current will flow through the circuit 
and energy will be supplied to  the bulb, so the bulb will glow. Hence, output Y=1. 
case(ii): If A=1 i.e., two switch A is closed, the energy will not supply to the bulb, so bulb will not glow and 
hence the output Y=0.

circuits.

(b) A + (B C) = (A + B) (A + C) 
 
4. Identity Law 
(a) A + A = A 
(b) A A = A

T=27+273=300K 
We know that 
k=1.38x10-23J/K 
q=1.6x10-19 C

Note: 
1. If primary voltage of the transformer is given with turns ratio, calculate the

value).

Therefore, Vs =

Np xVp => (

12) x230 => 19.167 V  
Vs is the rms value of the secondary of the transformer. 
Hence, convert into peak value. 
Vm = √2 x Vs 
 
2. If the rms value of the secondary voltage of the transformer is given, then 
convert into peak value. 
Example:  
If Vs is 200V-0V 
Vs=200V and vm = √2 x Vs=>282.84V

Example 1: 
vp=230 V with turns ratio 12:1:12 (Np:Ns:Np) 
w.k.t. 
Vp
Vs
=

Ns
 
Therefore, Vs =

Np xVp => (

12) x230 => 19.167 V  
Vs is the rms value of the secondary of the transformer.  
Hence, convert into peak value. 
vm = √2 x Vs
2   
NOTE: in the above expression, peak value is the √2𝑉𝑠 divided by two, because the secondary 
voltage would be divided into two halves at upper part and lower part of the secondary of the 
center tap transformer. 
 
Example 2: 
If Vs is given as 200V-0V-200V 
Vs=200V and vm = √2 x Vs=>282.84V 
 
Example 3: 
If Vs is given as 200V rms 
NOTE: Vs is the total secondary voltage. 
𝑉𝑚= √2 x Vs
2 => 141.2𝑉 
Example 4:  
If Vs is given as 50V-0-50V peak value 
Then, 𝑉𝑚= 50𝑉 
 
Example 5:  
If Vs is given as 100 V peak value 
Then, 𝑉𝑚=

2 => 50𝑉 
 
Example 6:  
If Vs is given as 100V peak to peak rms value

If Vs is given as 100V peak to peak value 
Then, 𝑉𝑚=

Example1:  
If Vs is 300V peak to peak rms value 
Vm = √2Vs

=> 212.13V 
Example2:  
If Vs is 300V peak to peak instantaneous value is given 
Vm = Vs
2 => 150 V 
NOTE:  
1. In half wave rectifier, there is only one pulse for every complete one cycle, hence, frequency 
of the output signal is same as the frequency of the input signal. 
2. In full wave rectifier, there are two pulses for every complete one cycle, hence, the 
frequency of the output signal is two times that of the frequency of the input signal.

P8. An HWR generates 30W DC power from 120W of AC input power. 
(i) What is the rectification efficiency? 
(ii) What happens to remaining 50 watts? 
Given data:  
PDC = 30 Watts 
Pac = 120 Watts 
To find:  
η, reason for lost of remaining 90W 
Solution: 
η = PDC
Pac
=> 25% 
25% rectification efficiency does not implies that, the remaining 90W power is wasted in the 
circuit. Out of 120W, 60W for positive half cycle and remaining 60W for negative half cycle. Also 
the internal resistance of the circuit affects the delivered output. 
Actually, power efficiency is 
30w
60w => 50%.  
That is, half wave rectifier accepts only 60W input power and converts into 30W DC. Therefore, 
it is appropriate to say that efficiency of rectification is 25% and not 50% which is power 
efficiency.

Problems on Zener diode voltage regulator 
 
Important mathematical expressions on Zener diode voltage regulator: 
 
1. Design of R: 
Current through the Zener diode depends on input voltage. When the input voltage is maximum, 
Zener current is maximum and should not increase IZ(max) rating of the Zener diode. In order to 
limit this, minimum value of R should be selected.  
Similarly, when the input voltage is minimum, Zener current is also minimum and it should not 
fall below IZ(min) in order to do so maximum value of R should be selected. 
Hence, in voltage regulator circuit, R acts as a current limiting resistor. 
 
W.K.T.,  
𝑅= Vin −VZ
I

Assume IL is constant 
If Vin = Vin(max) 
Iz = IZ(max) 
I = IZ(max) + IL 
Rmin = Vin(max) −VZ
IZ(max) + IL
−−−(2) 
If Vin = Vin(min) 
IZ = IZ(min) 
I = Iz(min) + IL 
Rmax = Vin(min) −VZ
IZ(min) + IL
−−−(3) 
 
 
2. IF the voltage across the Zener diode is greater than the Zener diode voltage, 
then inly Zener diode is working under break down region.

RL = RL(min) 
IL = IL(max)

RL + R 
If Vin = 40V, Vout = 20 V (> VZ, hence Zener diode is in break down region) 
 
If Vin = 80V, Vout = 40 V (> VZ, hence Zener diode is in break down region)

Justification:  If Vin varying from 40V to 80V, the reverse voltage applied across the Zener diode 
is greater than the Zener voltage, hence Zener diode is under break down region and it acts as a 
voltage source of VZ volts. RL is connected across the VZ and hence output voltage is a constant 
15V. 
 
2. Zener diode voltage regulator circuit is designed to provide 20V constant voltage across 
the load of 2K Ohms, if the input is 50V find the value of series resistance required. Also 
find diode current. Given PZ=0.5W and VZ =20V.

across the load, if Zener current are 5mA and 20mA, find the value of R required. Given 
input DC is 10V±20%. 
Given data:

To Find: 
𝑅_ min𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑅_𝑚𝑎𝑥  
Solution: 
𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑚𝑖𝑛) = 10 −20% ∗10 = 8𝑉 
𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑚𝑎𝑥) = 10 + 20% ∗10 = 12 𝑉 
𝑅𝑚𝑖𝑛= 𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑚𝑎𝑥) −𝑉𝑍
𝐼𝐿+ 𝐼𝑍(𝑚𝑎𝑥) => 87.5 𝑂ℎ𝑚𝑠 
𝑅𝑚𝑎𝑥= 𝑉𝑖𝑛(𝑚𝑖𝑛) −𝑉𝑍
𝐼𝐿+ 𝐼𝑍(𝑚𝑖𝑛) => 120 𝑂ℎ𝑚𝑠 
Average of Rmin and Rmax can be connected to the circuit. Hence R≈100Ohms
