A
rctic sea ice is that which forms on the Arctic Ocean during 
the winter months. Pure water, which contains no other 
molecules, substances or impurities, freezes at 0 degrees 
Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). The world’s seawater, on the other 
hand, contains around 3.5 per cent dissolved minerals and salts. This 
additional material lowers the freezing point of the seawater to around 
-2 degrees Celsius (28.4 degrees Fahrenheit) because the freezing 
point depends on the number of molecules present in a solution, as 
well as the type of molecule(s). During the winter months, when the 
air temperature in the Arctic starts to fall dramatically, a deep layer of 
seawater begins to develop minuscule ice crystals; this slushy water 
is called frazil ice. A further drop in temperature causes the frazil ice 
to thicken. Pockets of salty slush accumulate until they become so 
heavy they start to sink. This leaves the top layer of icy crystals with 
significantly less salt content. The freezing point of this surface water 
therefore becomes higher and the falling temperatures enable the 
crystals to solidify into pack ice. This pack ice grows to become one 
huge floating sheet (made up of many smaller floes), the thickness and 
coverage of which varies over the year, but reaches its peak in March. 
During the warmer summer months, meanwhile, the ice begins to 
retreat and break up, reaching its lowest extent around September.

Sea ice at the poles is important because it influences 
the weather across the entire planet. The ice acts like a 
mirror, deflecting the Sun’s rays back into the 
atmosphere. As the ice melts, more of the ‘dark’ ocean 
beneath, capable of absorbing the Sun’s heat, is 
exposed. When the Arctic is frozen, warmer water 
entering from the Pacific or Atlantic begins to cool, 
becoming dense and sinking. This displacement of 
water drives the circulation of Earth’s oceans, affecting 
weather and conditions throughout the world. So, in 
many respects, the amount and extent of Arctic sea ice 
is absolutely critical to the global climate.
High reflection
The white sea ice cover acts like a 
mirror, reflecting the Sun’s rays back 
out to space, preventing the sea from 
heating excessively.
Sea exposed
As the ice melts, there is more dark 
seawater to absorb sunlight, which 
further melts the ice.
Low reflection
The more sunlight absorbed by the 
seawater, the more the ice melts 
until, eventually, significantly less 
light is reflected back into space.

W
ater is not given enough credit for the role it plays in 
shaping Earth. Tectonic plates and volcanic eruptions are 
often cited as the culprits for most land features, but it 
is water and wave action that shapes our world’s coastlines. When a 
wave crashes on the shore it carries sediments that are suspended in 
the water, and it pushes larger sediments along the ground too. When 
a wave recedes it also takes sediment with it, but rarely at an equal 
rate. If a wave deposits more sediment than it takes away then this 
sediment builds up, causing coastlines to extend. Conversely, when 
more sediment is being removed than added, the coastline recedes or 
erodes. Coastal erosion is responsible for some of the most amazing 
landforms we know today, from the Twelve Apostles in Australia to 
the White Cliffs of Dover in England. The type of coastline that is 
created from erosion varies greatly depending on any number of 
factors, including the strength of the wave action and wind, 
the sediment composition of the coastline and the types 
of nearby rock. Coastal erosion is a very slow process, 
taking hundreds of years, but scientists believe that 
climate change is speeding things up. Climate 
change has caused a rise in sea levels and storm 
frequency and severity – both of which play a key 
role in erosion. Indeed, the UK’s Environment 
Agency estimates that the British coastline could 
erode from 67-175 metres (220-575 feet) over the 
next 100 years.

1. Cracks
Water finds the weakest point in the rock 
of a headland and then creates small 
cracks through hydraulic action.
2. Cave
As the waves break against 
the cracks, they open out 
into a small cave, which 
becomes larger and larger 
as time goes by.
3. Arch
Wave action from both 
sides of the cave causes 
it to break open, 
forming an arch-shaped 
structure over the sea.
4. Stack
Eventually, the meeting point of 
the tip of the arch and the 
headland will collapse, leaving a 
free-standing stack, separated 
entirely from the headland.
7. Stump
The stack gets eroded away 
even further until it eventually 
leaves just a stump, which is 
often covered at high tide.

W
hile corals may look like rocks and share several 
characteristics of plants, they are in fact animals. To be 
exact they are aquatic marine invertebrates (known as 
polyps) that live in the warm shallows of the clear coastal waters 
located around the world. A huge number of marine organisms 
make their home among the corals, making reefs some of the most 
abundant and varied habitats on Earth. Because the nutrients on 
which plankton need to feed dissolve better in deeper, cooler water, 
the warmer layers become a less attractive spot for the huge numbers 
of floating plankton to occupy. Therefore, the upper shallows remain 
warm and clear – the ideal living conditions for microscopic algae, 
which use sunlight to combine carbon dioxide and water to create 
their own food source, which they share with their coral.
Corals live in partnership with single-celled zooxanthellae algae, 
which are also responsible for the bright colours. If the algae die the 
coral will turn white, a damaging effect known as coral bleaching. Like 
jellyfish, corals are cnidarians, except they are rooted to the spot by a 
tube attached to a surface (usually rock), rather than floating freely like 
jellyfish. Cnidarians consist of a simple body, featuring a central mouth 
opening that is surrounded by stinging tentacles. The coral polyp is 
the soft individual organism that forms from a single-celled alga and 
lives within a larger community of similar polyps called a colony. They 
use calcium and a variety of other minerals in the seawater – together 
with the food waste they produce – to construct their own protective 
calcium carbonate skeleton shelters in which to live. When coral dies, 
the hard, chalky skeletal remains are left behind and new polyps will 
grow on top of these. Sedimentary limestone rock is formed when 
the coral skeletons are compacted over many thousands of years. 
Over hundreds of thousands of years, a colony of polyps can grow big 
enough to link up with other colonies to form a large coral reef.

How do 
seahorses 
reproduce?
Discover what makes 
this equine marine creature 
so unusual
U
sually found in the shallows 
of warm coastal areas, 
the seahorse is a breed of 
bony fi sh that mates for life. They 
swim upright and have a distinctly 
horse-like appearance, hence their 
name. Amazingly, it’s the male of 
this species that bears the young. 
The female deposits her eggs into 
the male’s brood pouch on its 
ventral side, which he then fertilises 
internally. The eggs later hatch into 
tiny seahorses inside this pouch. 
Brood pouch
The female deposits her 
eggs here for the male to 
fertilise in his body. The 
eggs remain in the pouch 
until they hatch into baby 
seahorses.
Stomach 
That’s a bit 
misleading as the 
seahorse actually 
doesn’t have a 
stomach. Instead 
the food they eat 
– note, they have 
no teeth – passes 
straight through 
their system. This 
is why they must 
consume so 
much.
Prehensile tail
The seahorse uses this 
tactile appendage to cling 
to corals, reeds and other 
marine vegetation so they 
can catch passing tiny sea 
creatures.
Dorsal fi n
For propulsion the 
seahorse has a small 
dorsal fi n, which can 
fl utter around 35 times 
per second. The 
creature moves 
vertically up and down 
through the water by 
increasing or 
decreasing, 
respectively, the 
volume of gas that’s 
inside its swim bladder.
Body
The entirety of a seahorse’s 
body – except for the male’s 
brood pouch – is protected by 
plates of bony armour, so 
predators tend to leave 
seahorses alone. Their size 
ranges from 1.5-35cm 
(0.6-14in) long.

Environment
How do 
pearls 
form?
P
earls develop inside molluscs – including oysters, mussels 
and clams – whenever a foreign particle enters its shell and 
irritates the soft inner tissues. If the animal can’t expel the 
irritant, it will engage a unique defence mechanism. To protect itself 
from the particle, the mollusc produces a substance called nacre, or 
mother-of-pearl, which also lines the inner surface of the creature’s 
shell. Layer upon layer of the hard crystalline nacre is then used to 
smother the invading object so it cannot harm or contaminate the 
mollusc. A pearl’s iridescent appearance is due to the many layers of 
nacre that consist of many microscopic crystals. The thickness of one 
layer of calcium carbonate plates is similar to the wavelength of visible 
light. Some of the light passing through the top layer of nacre will be 
reflected, but some will continue to travel through to the bottom layer 
where further light is reflected. Multiple reflections interfere with each 
other at different wavelengths, causing colours to be reflected and 
scattered in all directions, creating an iridescent finish.
How do pearls form?
How does a speck of dirt turn into a precious gem?
Irritant
If an invading microbe or 
grain of dirt infiltrates the 
shell, the mollusc will 
defend itself.
Shell
Cells in the shell’s outer 
mantle enable the 
mollusc to expand as the 
creature grows.
Epithelial cells
A ‘pearl sac’ of epithelial 
cells forms around the 
irritant. This sac secretes 
a smooth, crystalline 
substance called nacre.
Nacre
Layer upon layer of the 
calcium carbonate-based 
nacre builds up to protect 
the mollusc, and eventually 
form a pearl.

A 
red tide is the rapid accumulation of a mass of aquatic algae 
made up of mobile single-celled micro-organisms known as 
dinoflagellates – which means ‘whirling whip’ due to the nature 
of the tail-like projections that propel them through the water. The 
algae grows, or blooms, more rapidly than usual in order to consume 
nutrients that have suddenly risen up from the colder depths of the 
ocean below. The red hue is down to the presence of a certain species 
of dinoflagellate, or phytoplankton. Together with the more abundant 
diatom algae, dinoflagellates make up the majority of ocean plankton. 
Despite the rather startling appearance of a sea that has been turned 
red, many algal blooms are actually completely harmless. However, 
you shouldn’t consume seafood following a red tide as certain 
phytoplankton can release harmful substances into the water. Some 
dinoflagellates can produce toxins when eaten by other creatures and 
the harmful substances then concentrate inside the creatures that 
feed on them, and subsequently any humans who go on to dine on 
the contaminated seafood. The billions of microscopic dinoflagellates 
in a red tide can also cause spectacular bioluminescence at night. One 
species in particular – the lingulodinium polyedrum – can create its 
own light from within. When the organism is jostled or collides with 
something in the ocean, a chemical reaction occurs when an enzyme 
called luciferase and a substrate called luciferin, both contained within 
the organism, combine. This is the catalyst for a chemical reaction 
that releases a flash of blue light. When this occurs millions of times 
simultaneously, the effect is quite remarkable for onlookers.

O
n the north-east coast of County Antrim in Northern Ireland 
lies an unusual rock formation which draws in millions of 
visitors from around the world every year. They flock to see 
a vast plateau of polygonal basalt columns – which are commonly 
known as the Giant’s Causeway – which looks like a carpet of 
enormous stepping stones extending out into the Irish Sea. The basalt 
pillars that make up this amazing rock formation dramatically range 
in size from a matter of centimetres to several metres high. Although 
the Giant’s Causeway is so-named due 
to an ancient legend, its formation 
actually began up to 65 million years 
ago during the Tertiary period when 
volcanic activity forced tectonic plates 
to stretch and break. This caused 
magma to spew up from inside the 
Earth and spill out across the surface 
as lava. The temperature of erupting 
lava can range from between 700 
and 1,200 degrees Celsius (1,292 and 
2,192 degrees Fahrenheit). However, 
upon contact with the surface it will 
immediately begin to cool. At first this 
cooling is extremely rapid and this 
results in a hardened crust forming on 
top of the superhot substance, which

insulates the still liquid lava below. Because the lava is now insulated 
the cooling becomes increasingly slow over time. While you could 
probably walk on the crust after just half an hour or so, thick lava 
fl ows can take a number of years to cool completely and solidify all 
the way through. While the temperature falls the lava begins to dry 
out, and it’s this drying that causes the solidifying lava to crack and 
form regular pillars of basalt rock. The size and shape of each column 
is ultimately determined by the rate at which the lava actually cools 
and dries, and therefore the speed at which what’s called the ‘drying 
front’ moves. Scientists from the University of Toronto discovered that 
the slower the cooling rate the larger the basalt columns that formed.

I
n 2007, a team of 41 cavers worked their way into the limestone of 
the Arabika Massif in the Western Caucasus, Georgia, to descend 
to new depths of the Voronja Krubera cave system. Two branches 
of this subterranean warren were discovered to reach 1,775 metres 
(5,823 feet) and 1,920 metres (6,299 feet), but the deepest point – a 
sump dubbed ‘Two Captains’ – exceeded the two-kilometre (1.2-mile) 
mark to become the deepest natural cave in the world at 2,191 metres 
(7,188 feet). Essential kit used for casual spelunking (or potholing) 
includes a hard hat, headlamp, waterproofs, thermals, climbing gear 
and basic rations for longer expeditions. But the 2007 Krubera caving 
trip was comprised of professional spelunkers, known as speleologists, 
who weren’t just experienced at exploring caves but specialists in 
cave sciences including biology, hydrology and geology. The 41 team

well as recording the temperature and sampling sediments, micro-
organisms and speleothems (which include cave formations such as 
stalagmites). So as well as standard camping gear, sample containers 
and more unusual scientifi c devices such as ground-penetrating 
radar were used to help plan the best possible route ahead. Georgia 
(specifi cally the disputed region of Abkhazia) is home to the top three 
deepest caves on Earth and, incredibly, Two Captains is known to go 
deeperstill. Ropes and carabiners in the hands of expert climbers are 
essential for exploring these incredible depths, as the Voronja-Krubera 
system includes drops like the Big Cascade, which alone plummets 152

J
et streams are currents of fast-moving air that can be found high 
in the atmosphere of some planets. Here on Earth, when we 
refer to ‘the jet stream’, we’re typically talking about either of the 
polar jet streams. There are also weaker, subtropical jet streams located 
higher up in the atmosphere, but their altitude means they have less 
of an eff ect on commercial air traffi  c and the weather systems in 
more populated areas. The northern jet stream travels at about 161-322 
kilometres (100-200 miles) per hour from west to east, ten kilometres 
(six miles) above the surface in a region of the atmosphere that is 
known as the tropopause (the border between the troposphere and 
the stratosphere). 
It’s created by a combination of our planet’s rotation, atmospheric 
heating from the Sun and the Earth’s own heat from its core creating 
temperature diff erences and, therefore, pressure gradients along which 
air rushes. In the northern hemisphere, the position of the jet stream 
can aff ect the weather by bringing in or pushing away the cold air 
from the poles. Generally, if it moves south, the weather can turn 
rather wet and windy; too far south and it will become much colder 
than usual. The reverse is true if the jet stream moves north, inducing 
drier and hotter weather than average as warm air moves in from the 
south. In the southern hemisphere, meanwhile, the jet stream tends to 
be weakened by a smaller temperature contrast created by the greater 
expanse of fl at, even ocean surface. However, on occasion it can also 
impact the weather in the same way as the northern jet stream does. 
How do 
jet streams work?
They’re a vital component in regulating global 
weather, but what do jet streams actually do?

How do jet 
streams work?
27
Northern polar jet
Travelling west to east around the northern hemisphere, 
it helps keep northern Europe temperate.
Subtropical jet
These winds are much higher in the atmosphere than their 
polar counterparts, at around 17,000m (55,000ft).
Southern polar jet
The southern hemisphere’s 
jet stream runs around
the circumference of the 
Antarctic landmass.
Hadley cell
This atmospheric 
cell is partly 
responsible for 
the deserts 
and rainstorms in 
the tropics.
Polar cell
These north-south 
circulating winds bring 
in cold air from the 
freezing poles and 
produce polar 
easterlies.
Ferrel cell
These cells are balanced by 
the Hadley and polar cells, 
and create westerly winds. 
They are sometimes referred 
to as the ‘zone of mixing’.
 Winds of change 
Currents in the jet stream travel at various speeds, but the 
wind is at its greatest velocity at the centre, where jet streaks 
can reach speeds as fast as 322 kilometres (200 miles) per 
hour. Pilots are trained to work with these persistent winds 
when fl ying at jet stream altitude, but wind shear is a 
dangerous phenomenon that they must be ever vigilant of. 
This is a sudden, violent change in wind direction and speed 
that can happen in and around the jet stream, aff ecting even 
winds at ground level. A sudden gust like this can cause a 
plane that’s taking off /landing to crash, which is why wind 
shear warning systems are equipped as standard on all 
commercial airliners.

R
egular rainbows occur when moisture in the air refracts 
sunlight in such a way that it is broken up into its constituent 
colours. The phenomenon occurs when the Sun is positioned 
behind you and sunlight passes through the airborne water. The light 
refracts (bends) inside the droplets and the white light is broken up. 
Each colour has a diff erent wavelength so, depending on the angle 
of refraction, a diff erent colour of light will be refl ected outwards; the 
result of this process is what we observe when we see a rainbow.
Every rainbow is accompanied by another, secondary rainbow, 
but it’s usually too dim to see. This double rainbow eff ect is due to 
the continued refl ection of light inside each water drop. Sunlight is 
actually refl ected twice inside a drop: once to produce the primary 
rainbow and a second time at the back of the drop. This second 
refl ection inverts the light but undergoes the same refraction, so 
exits in the same way as before – though upside down. This second 
refl ection reduces the intensity of the sunlight, but it also produces a 
second inverted rainbow, creating a double arc of multicoloured light.

Secondary
If the incoming light is 
strong enough, a faint 
secondary rainbow will 
be observable.

irds of prey boast the greatest visual acuity of all animals and 
zoologists believe some hawks and eagles have vision eight 
times sharper than ours. An eagle’s retina sports around 1 
million sensory cells per square millimetre – around five times what 
you’d find in a human retina. It pays off: some birds of prey can spot 
and track a rabbit 1.5km (0.9 miles) away!
If you gauge eyesight in terms of light spectrum perception instead 
of acuity, the mantis shrimp is the champ. Mantis shrimp perceive 
11 or 12 primary colours, putting our three to shame, and they see 
ultraviolet and infrared light too.

the fl ow of water, causing it to churn and

much of the light that hits them, making 
the water appear white. Whether a river

water. This creates a variety of features in 
the river. Where water doubles back on 
itself, pockets fi lled with bubbles open up; 
these provide much less buoyancy and 
feel like ‘holes’. Objects lodged in the river 
can act as strainers, allowing water to 
pass through, but blocking larger debris. 
In areas where the water moves rapidly, 
it wears away at the surface of rocks 
underneath, creating undercuts.
The challenges of navigating the 
features of white-water rapids – whether 
jutting rocks or whirlpools – attract 
kayakers and rafters every year.

Third eyelid
Woodpeckers have a 
thick inner eyelid,

belt to ensure the bird’s 
eyeballs don’t pop out 
and also prevents 
tearing the retina. The 
eye is fi lled with blood

W
oodpeckers whack their heads against wood up to 20 
times a second, at 1,200 times the force of gravity, without 
suff ering concussion, detached retinas or any other 
symptoms of head injury. This is achieved through the incredible 
structure of their heads.
Holes
Woodpeckers excavate small 
rectangular holes on the sides 
of tree trunks, prying off  wood 
to expose tasty beetle larvae 
and carpenter ants.
Skull
Woodpeckers have a thicker skull than most other birds. 
It’s made of extremely strong yet spongy compressible 
bone, to help cushion the blow. The beak and skull are 
linked by elastic connective tissue.
Brain
Unlike human brains, which are fl oating about in a pool 
of cushioning cerebrospinal fl uid, woodpecker brains 
are tightly enclosed in the skull with practically no 
cerebrospinal fl uid.
Beak
The strong bones that 
comprise the woodpecker’s 
straight bill are strengthened 
by a horn-covered beak, which 
hammers into the wood and 
bark of a tree at something like 
12,000 impacts per day in 
search of bugs and ants.
Hyoid apparatus
Within the long tongue 
is a skeletal structure 
called the ‘hyoid 
apparatus’. This is a 
collection of small 
bones supported 
by cartilage and 
muscles, which fold 
up like an accordion 
and enable the 
woodpecker to stick its 
tongue out further.

ot quite. In the wild, giant pandas only live in China but 
captive ones have been sent to zoos around the world as gifts 
since the Fifties. None of those pandas are still alive though 
and, since 1984, almost all pandas have been given to zoos on a ten-
year lease. They remain Chinese 
property and so do any cubs born 
in captivity from the leased pandas. 
There are a few exceptions, however. 
In 2008 China gave, rather than

enus flytraps, like the rat-eating carnivorous plant, tend to grow 
in boggy soil that’s low in nutrients, hence they need to find 
another source of food to sustain them, namely insects that 
happen to land on their leaves. These leaves are about eight to 15cm 
long and are ‘hinged’ along the midline with spiny teeth around the 
edges. The folding and trapping action is triggered by pressure on 
six sensitive hairs that, when stimulated will snap the leaf shut 
in about half a second, although the actual nature of the action 
is still debated. As well as these sensitive hairs, the leaf also 
has glands on its surface that secrete a sap which digests the 
insect’s body. This process takes about ten days, after which 
the leaf reopens.

A
s we exhaust more easily accessible natural gas reserves, 
countries across the globe are increasingly turning to shale 
gas. But how do you release gas that’s imprisoned in millions 
of tiny pores inside shale rock, deep beneath Earth’s surface? The 
answer is hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.
Fracking involves drilling deep into rock and pumping a highly 
pressured jet of water, sand and chemicals down the wellbore. This 
forces a network of tiny cracks to open up and spread through the 
impermeable rock, allowing pockets of gas within the rock to seep out.
The main ingredient that makes up fracking fluid is water. Since 
water is incompressible, it can pass on the extreme pressures needed 
from the pump to the shale rock over 2,000 metres (6,560 feet) below. 
Sand or ceramic beads act as ‘proppants’, holding the cracks open after 
the pressure drops and while the gas is collected.
Finally, a cocktail of different chemicals is added. Their uses range 
from averting micro-organism growth to preventing corrosion 
of metal pipes, maintaining fluid viscosity and reducing 
friction during extraction.
Hydraulic fracturing was first used in the 1940s, 
but is far more efficient today. The advent of 
horizontal drilling in the Nineties, for instance, 
made wells far more productive, making the 
operation economically viable.
While fracking has allowed governments to 
unlock previously unreachable and abundant 
shale gas resources, it has sparked concerns 
among some geologists and conservationists. A 
fracking well uses millions of litres of water per

fracking fluid remains in the rock and, although much deeper than 
groundwater, some fear it could, over time, contaminate drinking 
supplies. The fluid recovered at the surface also needs to be disposed

from fault lines since they can increase the likelihood of earthquakes 
and tremors in at-risk areas.

elieve it or not, some of the world’s most forward-looking 
engineering is actually in operation right now, in the 
unexpected setting of the world’s theme parks. 
From the pioneering 18th Century ‘Russian Mountains’, people have 
been hooked on the frightful thrill of a roller coaster – and ever since, 
the challenge has been to make an even bigger, even better, even more 
terrifying one.
Today, they incorporate solutions that are at the leading edge of 
scientific development. This means they are able to accelerate as fast 
as a drag racer and let passengers experience G-forces way in excess of 
a Formula 1 race car. 
They do all this in complete safety, having passed the very  
strictest engineering standards. People travel for miles to ride on the 
latest roller coaster – they’ll even cross continents just to experience 
the thrill.
Roller coaster trains are unpowered. They rely on an initial 
application of acceleration force, then combine stored potential energy 
and gravitational forces to continue along the track. This is why they 
rise and fall as they twist and turn. 
There are various methods of launching a roller coaster. 
Traditionally, a lift hill is used – the train is pulled up a steep section of 
track. It is released at the top, where gravity transfers potential energy 
into kinetic energy, accelerating the train. Launches can be via a chain 
lift that locks onto the underneath of the train, or a motorised drive

tyre system, or a simple cable lift. There is also the catapult  
launch lift: the train is accelerated very fast by an engine or a  
dropped weight. 
Newer roller coasters use motors for launching. These generate 
intense acceleration on a flat section of track. Linear induction motors 
use electromagnetic force to pull the train along the track. They are 
very controllable with modern electronics. Some rides now have 
induction motors at points along the track, negating the need to store 
all the energy at the lift hill – giving designers more opportunities to 
create new sensations. Hydraulic launch systems are also starting to 
become more popular.
Careful calculation means a roller coaster releases roughly enough 
energy to complete the course. At the end, a brake run halts the train – 
this compensates for different velocities caused by varying forces due 
to changing passenger loads.

 How are roller coasters designed?

Dive loop
A dive loop is a type of roller coaster 
inversion where the track twists upwards 
and to the side, and then dives toward the 
ground in a half-vertical loop.
Zero gravity roll
Riders experience 0g – gravity is 
cancelled out by opposing forces so 
there is a feeling of weightlessness. It is 
often felt on uphill 360-degree twists. 
Train
Two or more cars linked up are 
called a train. The position of the 
car in a train dictates the eff ects 
on the riders. 
Brake run
These are sections of track, usually at 
the end, that incorporate a braking 
device to slow the roller coaster. These 
can be skids, a fi n on the car or, more 
recently, magnetic eddy current brakes.
Roller coasters comprise many elements, each with its 
own specifi c physical characteristics. Designers give a 
ride character by applying an understanding of physics 
to build up a sequence of thrills. These are all 
interrelated and mean the experience of every ride is 
exciting and unique.
Computer models can analyse the forces that will be 
produced by each twist and turn, ensuring they are 
kept within specifi c boundaries. Roller coasters may 
look like just a random snake of track, but the reality is 
actually years of scientifi c calculations to provide just 
the right eff ects.

T
oday there are two main methods for waterproofing a 
smartphone: physical barriers such as port covers and sealed 
seams that prevent liquid entering externally, and nanocoatings 
that penetrate the device entirely and actively repel water. While both 
techniques are used, the most effective is the latter, enabling devices 
to be water resistant without compromising on size and aesthetics.
There are different types of nanocoating, but one of the most 
commonly used is that made by P2i. This company’s waterproofing 
process involves subjecting any electronic gizmo to a plasma-
enhanced vapour in a vacuum chamber at room temperature. The 
vapour contains a gaseous polymer, which when brought into contact 
with the device’s surfaces – both external and internal – forms a super-
strong covalent bond and waterproof barrier 1,000 times thinner than 
a human hair.
Once on the phone, the ultra-thin polymer layer then dramatically 
reduces its surface energy, forcing any water that comes into contact 
with it to bead up and be repelled. Obviously, in the case of a 
smartphone, this action would prevent water from penetrating the 
delicate internal components. However, due to the vapour disposition 
process, even if water were to penetrate the mobile’s casing, each 
internal component would also be coated with the polymer, protecting 
them until the water evaporated or was dried off manually.

ard-disk drives (HDDs) have been around since IBM conceived 
of the need for extra computer storage in 1956. A hard disk 
uses magnetised platters made of aluminium, ceramics or 
even glass to store data. These are typically rotated at 5,400 or 7,200 
revolutions per minute for drives in home PCs. An arm that hovers just 
above the platters reads data from and writes data to the disk. SSDs, 
meanwhile, are built very much like the USB fl ash drives that have 
become popular over the last decade. There are no moving parts in an 
SSD, which helps it to access data signifi cantly faster. SSDs use a type 
of memory called NAND, which is non-volatile: instead of writing a 
magnetic pattern to a ceramic substrate, it stores data as an electrical 
signal that it retains even after the computer is switched off . Each SSD 
features a small processor called a controller, which performs the same 
role as the read/write arm of an HDD.

L
ight trails are a colourful and creative effect that photographers 
can capture by employing long-exposure shooting on their 
camera. The basic principle of light trail creation is that by 
manually dropping a camera’s shutter speed to a very low level, light 
is captured by the sensor over an artificially long period of time, with 
every passing vehicle having its lights tracked and recorded over the 
visible distance of the road. 
To take a shot like this one, find a roadside vantage point in 
which no other moving objects are visible other than the passing 
vehicles. Second, mount the camera on a tripod, as stability is key 
while shooting long-exposure imagery. This is because if there is 
any camera shake while the unit’s shutter is open, then the 
captured light will lose its direction and smudge across 
the entire image. Next select the shutter priority

How do 
machines 
make ice?
I
cemakers are essentially conveyor belts of ice cubes made for 
instant use. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes for different 
purposes, but almost all use the method of freezing water in a 
mould and then heating it slightly so the ice cubes slide out with ease. 
Here we look at how a conventional icemaker built into a domestic 
fridge-freezer works.
1. Water valve
At the start of the 
cycle, a valve 
opens for a few 
seconds to  
allow water into 
the mould.
4. Heating coil
Once frozen, a heating 
coil warms the bottom 
of the ice to loosen the 
cubes from the 
mould’s surface.
3. Cooling
The water is frozen by 
the cooling unit in the 
refrigerator, rather 
than the icemaker.
5. Blades
A motor spins a 
gear that rotates 
blades to scoop 
the ice cubes out 
the moulds.
7. Shut-off arm
A shut-off arm 
prevents the cycle 
repeating until 
more ice cubes are 
required.
2. Ice mould
The water fills the ice 
moulds, with each 
connected to the 
next by a cavity.
6. Collection
The ice cubes are pushed 
out by the blades and are 
deposited into a bin.

Compasses/ 
Printer inks
S
uppose printers used red, green and blue ink instead. Which 
colours would you mix to make yellow? You couldn’t do it. 
Mixing red and green light gives yellow because you are 
adding together photons of diff erent wavelengths. 
But with ink, you start with white ambient 
light and refl ect it off  the pigment molecules, 
which absorb some of the photons. So you are 
subtracting wavelengths, rather than adding 
them. The printer ink colours of cyan, 
magenta and yellow are used because they 
each absorb one of the primary colours – yellow 
ink absorbs blue light, and refl ects red and green, 
for example.
Can a compass work underground?
Would a traditional compass work beneath the surface?
Should print inks be primary colours? 
What are the best colour inks to use in printers?
Right
A compass like this 
might work 
underground – it just 
depends how far!
T
he compass app on your phone probably won’t 
work because it relies on radio signals that are 
easily blocked by rock or water, but 
for a compass with a wobbly needle, it just 
depends on how far underground. A compass 
works because its magnetised needle lines up 
with the magnetic fi eld that runs between 
Earth’s north and south poles, and that fi eld is 
just as powerful if you go down a mineshaft 
or into the depths of the ocean. But the fi eld is 
created by swirling molten iron in Earth’s core, 
and if you could drill that far down, you’d fi nd 
your magnetic needle going haywire.

M
odern missiles can be guided to a target, often by their  
own systems. The most common kind of homing  
technology detects and locks on to infrared (IR) radiation, 
such as the heat from a jet exhaust. Modern systems detect two 
wavelengths: 3-5 micrometres and 8-13 micrometres. The second 
wavelength isn’t absorbed by the atmosphere, so it’s much easier to 
track. This also makes flares – the intense infrared countermeasures 
that are ejected by a target in 
order to lure the missile off 
course – less effective.
Missiles are essentially 
rockets fitted with an explosive 
warhead and an infrared 
detection sensor connected 
to a flight computer. These 
sensors are often made of 
mercury cadmium telluride to 
pick up the specific infrared 
wavelengths emitted by the 
enemy target.

Technology

However, sometimes missiles need to be fed targeting information 
constantly from their launcher, while the on-board fl ight control 
system steers the weapon. Indeed, on some occasions this means the 
target will be ‘painted’ with a laser; that energy signature will then 
guide the missile. Others still make use of mounted cameras which 
let an operator direct the missile post-launch and guarantee it’s not 
duped by countermeasures.
Homing tech can be used for defence as well as attack, as this anti-missile system shows…
1. Enemy missile
A ballistic is fi red from a 
hostile state or aircraft 
many miles away.
2. Radar station
The launch is detected by a radar 
station and a targeting trajectory is 
instantly fed to the interceptor.
3. Interceptor homing missile
The interceptor is launched, initially 
targeted at the course the hostile 
weapon was detected on.
4. Acquisition
When it gets to a close enough position, 
the interceptor’s own on-board IR 
systems lock on to the target.
5. Interception
The missile steers itself towards the 
incoming bomb, exploding when close 
enough and destroying them both.

R
andom access memory (RAM) is a type of physical data 
storage that can be used to read and write data to so it can be 
accessed by a computer’s CPU (central processing unit). RAM is 
considerably faster than the hard disk drive memory used to store fi les 
and, as such, allows data to be processed more effi  ciently. Importantly, 
unlike hard disk memory, RAM is volatile and 
does not retain info after power is cut to the 
machine, resetting for future usage. Today, 
DDR SDRAM – or double data rate synchronous 
random access memory – is popular as it 
provides a high bandwidth for fast reading and 
writing. Apart from use in PCs, today RAM is 
also present on most smartphones.

arcodes are a machine-readable way of writing letters and

many types of barcodes, but the ones most commonly found in 
supermarkets use a row of lines of diff erent widths. The diff erent 
widths represent diff erent numbers. In the UK many items are 
coded with a GTIN – Global Trade Item Number. This allows 
the manufacturer to print the barcode on the packages. The 
numbers are unique to that item. The barcode only has a 
number, but no product information. That is held in a database 
which the retailer can access at the point of sale. It also means 
that shops can set their own prices and change them easily.

The same mechanism
that is used in 
traditional 
fi rearms was only 
slightly adapted for 
the fl are gun
A 
fl are gun works in the same way as any traditional fi rearm 
with one key diff erence: it must ignite its projectile and propel 
it high into the sky. Generally credited to Edward Very, the 
fi rst gun that could fi re a fl are was tested by the American Navy back 
in 1882. When the trigger of a fl are gun is pulled, a chain of events 
begins. First, the fl are’s propellant is ignited as the gun’s hammer 
strikes the detonator cap. The signal is then pushed out of the gun’s 
barrel through defl agration, which is a subsonic combustion process 
where an intense burning of gases in a small space generates pressure.
The short time it takes to ignite the propellant is enough for the 
fl are to also be lit. These objects burn so brightly because they contain 
magnesium, an element also used in fi reworks. Other chemical 
additives can produce varying colours. In some cases, the fl are will 
also have an in-built parachute (most commonly for military use) 
that prolongs its fall to Earth and extends the 
average 40-second period that a fl are will 
typically burn brightly for.

F
ire sprinkler systems are fed by pressurised water from the 
mains or by their own supply. This water is kept from being 
released by a plug inside the sprinkler head that will only 
be released when the room’s temperature exceeds 68 degrees 
Celsius (155 degrees Fahrenheit). At this temperature, the tiny 
ampule that seals the plug mechanism will shatter to release a 
deluge of water.
In more vulnerable environments, smaller-diameter ampules 
are used for a faster response time. Some sprinkler heads have 
spring-loaded plates soldered in place over the plug, and are 
activated when the solder melts. These are known as closed-
type sprinklers, because once they are opened, they will spray 
water until their supply is cut. The on-off  sprinkler features a 
heat-sensitive pilot valve that stops the discharge of water 
once the temperature has dropped.

What is underfloor heating?
What is this economical and efficient way of keeping our homes toasty?
T
raditional wall-mounted radiator heating systems that are 
found in most homes convect heat into the room, sending 
heat towards the ceiling in a circular cycle. In contrast, 
underfloor heating consists of electric elements, or water pipes,  
that radiate heat up evenly throughout the whole room. For 
optimum efficiency, a thermostat in each room can monitor and 
control the temperature.
Underfloor heating is also unobtrusive and easier to maintain 
as the elements, or pipework, can be embedded in concrete floors 
when houses are constructed, or they can be fitted under existing 
flooring. A saving of 20 per cent can be made on fuel bills, and for 
buildings with high ceilings, savings can reach as high as 40 per 
cent compared with traditional heating systems.

T
ower cranes flock to money. During the economic boom years, 
high-rise construction cranes migrated from Beijing to Shanghai 
to Dubai, where it was estimated in 2006 that there was one 
tower crane for every 44 residents of the desert boom-opolis. 
Tower cranes are feats of structural engineering that often outshine 
their creations. They are designed to stand 80 metres tall and reach 80 
metres out supported only by a narrow steel-frame mast, a concrete 
foundation and several counterweights.
The engineering principle that keeps the twiggy tower crane from 
tipping over is something called a ‘moment’. If you hang a weight  
from the crane’s jib arm, it exerts a rotational force or torque where  
the arm connects to the top of the mast. The magnitude and  
direction of this force (clockwise or anti-clockwise) is called the 
moment. If the weight is hung close to the mast, the magnitude of  
the moment is lower than if the weight is hung far out on the jib. To 
keep the crane upright, counterweights are used to create a moment  
of equal magnitude in the opposite direction, balancing out the 
rotational forces. 
Once a tower crane meets its maximum unsupported height, it 
can be tethered to the building itself and continue to grow with the 
rising skyscraper. The tower cranes that rose with the construction of 
the record-breaking Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai reached a truly 
dizzying height of 750 metres.

How do cranes 
get so high?
53
Technology
One of the most remarkable engineering feats of tower 
cranes is that they can literally build themselves. With 
help from a large mobile crane, construction workers 
secure the base sections of the tower and assemble the 
top unit of the crane – the slewing unit, jib and 
machinery arm. 
But before the top section of the crane is attached, 
workers slide a hydraulic climbing unit around the 
base of the tower. Once everything is in place, the 
hydraulic climbing unit lifts the entire top section of 
the crane (including the horizontal jib and operator’s 
cab) just enough to slide in a new section of tower 
beneath. Once the new section is secured, the 
hydraulic unit continues to climb up, section by 
section, as the crane slowly builds itself higher. 
 How is a crane assembled? 
Operator’s cab
It’s a long climb to the cab, where the crane 
operator has a bird’s-eye view of the construction 
site through floor-to-ceiling windows.
The tower
Also known as the mast, each 2.8-metre tower 
section has four sides, each with vertical, horizontal 
and diagonal trusses for full structural integrity. 
Jib arm
The horizontal arm of a 
tower crane can extend 
outward 85m. The arm has 
three sides forming an isosceles 
triangle with a trolley track running 
along the bottom section.
Trolley
The trolley and hook are connected by 
cables to a trolley motor mounted on 
the upper side of the jib arm. The 
operator can roll the trolley back and 
forth with hand controls. 
Cat head tower
On hammerhead tower 
cranes, the cat head tower 
reinforces the jib arm and 
counterweight jib using thick 
steel cables called pendants. 
Machinery arm
The power to raise and lower 
the load line is supplied by a 
huge winch located along the 
counterweight jib or 
machinery arm. 
Counterweights
Multiple concrete slabs – 
each weighing several tons 
– are hung or piled on the 
very back end of the 
counterweight jib to 
overcompensate for the 
crane’s lifting capacity. 
Hydraulic climbing 
section
The hydraulic unit attaches 
to the outside of the tower. A 
powerful hydraulic arm lifts 
the entire top section of the 
crane just enough for the 
crane to insert a new section 
beneath.
Concrete foundation
Large tower cranes get their core stability by 
burying the bottom of the tower in several metres 
of concrete weighing 185 tons. 
Slewing unit
This motorised pivot allows 
the jib arm to rotate nearly 
360 degrees to lift and drop 
materials all across the 
construction site.

the panel of the jukebox, or via a remote-control unit, a location 
wheel on the pick-up mechanism sends it along its track to the 
correct CD location.
The pick-up mechanism lifts the selected disc, takes it back 
to the centre of the jukebox, and drops it down to the playback 
head. The CD playing head will scan the number of tracks on 
that disc and play the one that was selected. Once the track has

How do 
kettles boil 
water?
T
he electric kettle works thanks to two design breakthroughs 
achieved in Britain in the Twenties and Thirties. The fi rst is the 
immersed heating resistor, the piece of technology responsible 
for actually heating the water in the kettle. Resistors, which take 
the form of the heating element in the bottom of the kettle, work by 
resisting the fl ow of electric current passed through them, creating 
resistance and consequently heat. This heat is then passed into the 
water, which is subsequently heated up. The second of these advances 
allowed for an automatic cut-off  point, preventing the kettle from 
perpetually heating up the water. A bimetallic strip was introduced 
to the electric kettle by Russell Hobbs in 1955 which when heated by 
steam expanded, triggering a shut-off  switch.
Although some kettles have fancier and 
more complex heating and shut-off  
designs, it is through these two basic 
principles that the electric kettle 
evolved into the appliance we have 
in our kitchens today.

A
long with liquids and solids, gases 
are one of the three major states of 
matter. Typically they result when 
a substance is heated in its liquid state 
to its boiling point, or when evaporation 
occurs from the surface of a liquid. There 
are numerous types and classifications 
of gases, including elements that naturally 
exist in a gaseous form, compound gases 
comprising more than one element, and mixtures 
of individual pure gases.
Gas particles are much more loosely connected than 
those found in liquid or solid states, which results in 
lower density – and this is ultimately what sets a gas apart 
from the other two phases. Without changes in pressure 
or temperature, gas particles move around freely 
and randomly. They have no set shape and only change 
direction and momentum when bouncing off one  
another or off the inside of a container. Negatively 
charged areas of particles are attracted to positively 
charged areas – how these interact varies 
depending on the gas and are part of what 
makes each one unique. Because most gases are 
colourless, they are measured by four different 
properties: volume, temperature, pressure and 
number of particles; the latter property is more 
commonly known as moles. When put into a 
container (and not pressurised) gas molecules 
will evenly distribute themselves.

hen we breathe in, the inhaled air can contain dust, 
chemicals and other irritants that can be harmful to the 
body, particularly to organs in the respiratory system like 
the lungs. While the tiny hairs inside the nostrils (cilia) trap many of 
these particles, some will often get through. To help you out, your 
body reacts to try and forcibly expel the offending particles via the 
sneeze reflex arc.
There are a number of other reasons why we sneeze, including to 
clear the nasal passages when you have a cold, to expel allergens if 
you are allergic to something, and even bright sunlight can cause 
some people to sneeze.
When a stimuli is detected by the nerve endings in the nose, 
impulses are sent to the brain, which initiates a chain of physiological 
events that enable the body to rid itself of the unwelcome item.
Why do we sneeze?
How does this automatic reflex expel unwanted irritants from the body?

1. Irritation
Prior to irritation, the 
diaphragm muscles are relaxed. 
When an irritant enters the 
body, nerve endings in the 
lining of the nose signal to  
the brain.
2. Muscles contract
The brain tells the respiratory 
muscles – including throat, 
chest and diaphragm –  
to contract.
3. Intake of breath
Contraction of the diaphragm 
causes a sharp intake of breath.
4. Air pressure rises
The brain signals to the throat 
to close. This, combined with 
the contraction of the 
abdominal muscles, raises the 
air pressure inside the lungs.
5. Sneeze
The throat reopens suddenly, 
explosively forcing air out of the 
body, making the chest cavity 
contract sharply. The diaphragm 
relaxes once again.
6. Mucus
Together with the offending 
irritant, saliva and mucus 
from inside the mouth and 
nasal cavity are also 
expelled from the body at 
up to 160km/h (100mph).

nside a glow stick is a thin glass vial containing chemicals. When 
you bend the stick you’re breaking this vial open, releasing the 
chemicals into the rest of the glow stick, where other chemicals 
react with them and release light. 
Some chemical reactions produce light, known as 
‘chemiluminescence’. Usually the vial contains a solution phenyl 
oxalate ester and a fluorescent dye – which will determine the colour 
of the glow stick – while the surrounding tube contains a solution of 
hydrogen peroxide. Mixing these compounds causes the electrons to 
rise to a higher energy level and return to their normal state, releasing 
energy as light as they do. 
How do glow sticks glow?
What’s going on inside these popular light sticks?
How do glow 
sticks glow?
Science
1. Snap
When the glow stick is bent or 
snapped, the glass vial breaks 
and releases its chemicals into 
the surrounding chemical-
containing tube.
2. Oxidise
The phenyl oxalate ester in the 
vial is oxidised by the hydrogen 
peroxide in the tube, producing a 
chemical called ‘phenol’ and 
unstable peroxyacid ester.
3. Decompose
The unstable peroxyacid ester 
decomposes, which creates 
additional phenol and another 
peroxy compound, which 
decomposes to carbon dioxide.
4. Energy
The decomposition to 
carbon dioxide releases 
energy into the dye, which 
causes the electrons in the 
atoms to move to a higher 
energy level.
5. Light
The electrons will then fall back 
down to their original energy level 
by releasing this additional gained 
energy in the form of light.

T
he eye is often compared to a basic camera, and indeed the 
very first camera was designed with the concept of the eye 
in mind. We can reduce the complex process that occurs to 
process light into vision within the eye to a relatively basic sequence of 
events. First, light passes through the cornea, which refracts the light 
so that it enters the eye in the right direction, and aqueous humour, 
into the main body of the eye through the pupil. The iris contracts to 
control pupil size and this limits the amount of light that is let through 
into the eye so that light-sensitive parts of the eye are not damaged.
The pupil can vary in size between 2mm and 8mm, increasing to 
allow up to 30 times more light in than the minimum. The light is 
then passed through the lens, which further refracts the light, which 
then travels through the vitreous humour to the back of the eye and is 
reflected onto the retina, the centre point of which is the macula.
The retina is where the rods and cones are situated, rods being 
responsible for vision when low levels of light are present and cones 
being responsible for colour vision and specific detail. All the light 
information that has been received by the eye is then converted 
into electrical impulses by a chemical in the retina called rhodopsin, 
also known as purple visual, and the impulses are then transmitted 
through the optic nerve to the brain where they are perceived as 
‘vision’. The eye moves to allow a range of vision of approximately 180 
degrees and to do this it has four primary muscles which control the 
movement of the eyeball. These allow the eye to move up and down 
and across, while restricting movement so that the eye does not rotate 
back into the socket.

Cornea
The cornea is a transparent 
layer, covering the pupil, iris 
and aqueous humour. It helps 
refract the light towards the 
retina so that light is received 
in the correct area.
Iris
The iris is the coloured part of 
the eye which contracts to 
control the level of light 
admitted into the eye. The hole 
which light enters through is 
called the pupil.
Lens
The lens is a transparent 
disc in the eye which, 
with the cornea, refracts 
light that enters the eye 
so that it is received by 
the retina.
Sclera
This is the fi brous, white 
exterior of the eye that 
is an important 
protective layer for the 
more delicate insides of 
the eye.
Optic nerve
After the retina has 
processed light into 
electrical impulses, the 
optic nerve transports 
this information to 
the brain.
Retina
The retina is the light-sensitive area 
which processes light admitted into 
the eye and converts it into 
electrical impulses which are 
transmitted to the brain via the 
optic nerve.

How does 
our vision 
work?
Science
Rods are the light-sensitive cells in our eyes that aid our 
vision in low levels of light. Rods are blind to colour and 
only transmit information mainly in black and white to 
the brain. They are far more numerous with around 120 
million rods present in every human eye compared to 
around 7 million cones. Cones are responsible for 
perceiving colour and specifi c detail. Cones are 
primarily focused in the fovea, the central area of 
the macula whereas rods mainly surround the outside 
of the retina. Cones work much better in daylight as 
light is needed to perceive colour 
and detail.
Colour is not actually inherent in any object. We 
only see colour because objects absorb some 
colour from light, and refl ect others. It is the 
refl ected ones that we see and that give an object a 
set ‘colour’. Therefore, for example, grass is not 
green, it purely absorbs all other colours in light 
and refl ects back green. If an object refl ects all 
colours we will see it as white, if it absorbs all 
colours we see it as black. We use cones to perceive 
colour as rods are blind to colour.

How does detergent get our 
clothes clean?
Discover the chemistry at work inside your washing machine
Cleaning 
clothes
A
nionic surfactants are the workhorse ingredients of most 
washing detergents. They are compounds such as sodium 
alkyl sulphate and are made up of molecules that have 
opposite charges at diff erent points (polar molecules). Water is also 
made of polar molecules and, when mixed with washing detergent, 
the hydrophilic (water-loving) part of the surfactant molecule 
attracts to the water molecule, while the hydrophobic (water-
hating) part of the molecule adheres to the dirt and grease in 
your clothes. This makes the dirt and grime more soluble in 
the water, allowing for easier removal from your clothing.
Another cleaning eff ect surfactants have is to lower 
the surface tension of water. Surface tension is created 
by these polar molecules pulling on one another due to 
their charge. This accounts for how pond skaters walk 
on water and why beads of water hang on grass. By 
lowering surface tension, the water can become more 
‘wet’ and permeate clothes better.
Grime buster
Surfactants in detergent break down the 
bonds in water molecules so that they can 
react better with any molecules of dirt.

Bubbles/ 
De-icer
D
e-icers work by lowering the freezing point of water, which 
causes it to turn back from ice into liquid water. Usually 
this is due to the addition of a chemical compound such 
as sodium chloride (often called 
rock salt) or calcium chloride. Most 
de-icers that you can buy off the shop 
shelf aren’t designed to melt every 
piece of ice they come into contact 
with – they simply break the bond 
between the ice and the surface 
allowing for easier manual removal 
of the ice.

a high surface tension due to intermolecular

another, trying to minimise the surface area 
and be as flat as possible. Soap reduces this 
surface tension. However the effect of surface 
tension is still present which causes the bubble 
‘film’ to be stretched. A sphere is formed 
because this shape is the shape with the least

W
hiplash is a widespread term used to describe a number 
of injuries caused when the neck is suddenly and quickly 
forced to move back and then forth, or forward then back, 
or even from side to side. Such movement is often the result of a traffi  c 
collision, or following a blow to the head or fall during a contact sport.
The bones of the human spine serve to protect the fragile spinal 
cord which is located within. Of the 33 vertebrae of the human 
spine, whiplash aff ects the seven cervical vertebrae found at the top. 
Vertebrae are connected to one another by bands of fi brous connective 
tissue called ligaments. They are also connected to the surrounding 
muscles by tendons. In the event of an incident, damage can be done 
to both of these tissues in the vicinity of the neck.
During an incident where a vehicle has struck the victim from 
behind, the head will be forced very quickly back and then forwards, 
but likewise if the sudden neck movement is due to very abrupt 
deceleration, the head will instead be jerked in the other direction 
– ie fi rst forward and then back. Both types can result in whiplash 
injuries ranging from neck stiff ness and loss of movement to back and 
shoulder pain, headaches and even numbness that can radiate down 
the shoulders, arms and hands.
It should be noted that although whiplash is considered a fairly 
minor injury, any head or neck trauma should be checked out by a 
medical professional. However, most muscle and tissue injuries do not 
show up on X-rays, so sometimes it can be diffi  cult to diagnose.

67
Science
© SPL
1. Like a whip
A collision from behind causes the 
head to jolt backwards before 
quickly being whipped forwards 
due to momentum.
4. Jerk
When the head is jerked 
forwards fl exion of the 
vertebrae takes place as 
momentum thrusts the head 
down onto the chest.
5. Further tearing
The ligaments are 
further damaged and 
often torn as they are 
stretched in the 
opposite direction.
2. Intervertebral discs
The shock-absorbing intervertebral discs allow for some vertebral 
motion – extension (back) and fl exion (forwards); during whiplash, 
however, they are squeezed between the vertebrae. When the nerves 
are pinched between two vertebrae this can cause pain or numbness.
3. Torn ligaments
The cervical ligaments, tendons 
and muscles become damaged as 
the head is forced back into a 
position beyond its normal range 
of movement.
 Tendons vs ligaments 
While both tendons and ligaments are made of collagen 
cells, that’s where the similarity ends. Ligaments are 
the tough connective tissues that link bone to bone by a 
joint and provide shock absorbency. They are strong 
and fl exible bands of tissue but cannot be stretched. An 
overstretched ligament results in a sprain as 
experienced during whiplash.
Tendons, meanwhile, are the whitish fi brous cords 
that link one end of a muscle to a bone or other 
structure. Tendons look white as, unlike muscles, they 
don’t contain many blood vessels.
A damaged ligament can often be surgically 
reattached to a joint bone, with mobility returning 
relatively quickly. A tendon, however, is part of the 
neuromuscular system and so electrical signals must be 
able to pass across the tendon to reach a muscle in order 
for it to react. Treatment typically involves a rest period, 
with a support, and then a gradual return to exercise.

A 
mutation is a change in the genetic material of an organism. 
We’re made from trillions of cells, each with a nucleus 
composed of DNA – a set of instructions that tells the cell what 
to do. Cells copy themselves with astonishing accuracy, but every now 
and then a piece of code is copied incorrectly. This is largely due to 
natural radiation interacting with our DNA. This incorrect 
piece of code can become a permanent change in the 
DNA. Mutations are rarely harmful though. Indeed, most 
mutations go unnoticed, as the body has mechanisms to 
stop a cell copying itself. Sometimes mutations can benefit 
organisms. When a mutation allows an organism to cope 
better with an environmental stress, it will be passed on to 
future generations through natural selection.

C
entrifugal force describes the sensation one has of being 
pushed outward when moving along a circular path. The 
feeling of being pushed outwards when speeding round a 
corner in a vehicle, or while riding on a merry-go-round, comes  
from your preference to move in a straight line. Isaac Newton 
showed that all objects have inertia and will either stay at  
rest, or move in a straight line, unless a force acts on them. 
When you move in a circle there is a force pulling on 
you, changing your direction from that of a straight line. 
This is centripetal force and pulls inwards. The feeling of 
the ‘outward pull’ of centrifugal force is just your natural 
resistance to this.

Why do we sweat?
As your doctor may tell you, it’s glandular…
Why do
we sweat?
S
weat is produced by dedicated sweat glands, and is a mechanism 
used primarily by the body to reduce its internal temperature. 
There are two types of sweat gland in the human body, the 
eccrine gland and the apocrine gland. The former regulates body 
temperature, and is the primary source of excreted sweat, with the 
latter only secreting under emotional stresses, rather than those 
involved with body dehydration.
Eccrine sweat glands are controlled by the sympathetic nervous 
system and, when the internal temperature of the body rises, secrete 
a salty, water-based substance to the skin’s surface. This liquid then 
cools the skin and the body through evaporation, storing and then 
transferring excess heat into the atmosphere.
Both the eccrine and apocrine sweat glands only appear in 
mammals and, if active over the majority of the animal’s body, act as 
the primary thermoregulatory device. Certain mammals only have 
eccrine glands in specific areas – such as paws and lips – warranting 
the need to pant to control their temperature.

A
vacuum is a space that has less gaseous pressure than the 
standard atmospheric pressure at sea level on Earth. A partial 
vacuum can be easily created by simply pumping air out 
of a container. If the container is not sealed, though, the air will be 
replaced fairly quickly.
In everyday life, vacuums are used in light bulbs, cathode ray tubes, 
cleaning appliances, and to package, protect and preserve a range of 
foodstuff s. Creating a vacuum drove the piston mechanism in the 
Newcomen steam engine and was also used in the braking systems 
of trains. Household vacuum cleaners work by sucking in air, which 
creates a lower air pressure than that outside the device. To restore the 
partial vacuum the outside pressure forces air, and with it dirt/dust etc, 
into the appliance.
The purest vacuums can be found in outer space. Between 
galaxies, the vacuum density drops to ~0.001 atoms per cubic 
centimetre, while in the void between stars in the Milky Way, the 
vacuum is ~0.1-1 atoms per cubic centimetre. This is in 
contrast to a vacuum cleaner that produces a vacuum of 
around 1019 molecules per cubic centimetre, though 
highly sophisticated extreme-high vacuum (also 
known as XHV) lab chambers have managed to 
achieve a vacuum of fewer than 1,000 molecules 
per cubic centimetre.
Whether man-made or natural, there is 
no such thing as a perfect vacuum. Even 
in a virtually complete vacuum, physicists 
have discovered the presence of quantum 
fl uctuations and vacuum energy. See opposite 
for more on fi re and sound work inside a vacuum.

How do 
painkillers  
cure headaches?
W
e all feel pain differently, depending on the severity of the 
injury or ache, as well as our health and our pain threshold. 
When you are in pain, nerve endings transmit the pain 
signal to the brain via the spinal cord. The brain then interprets the 
level of pain. 
There are two key types of painkillers that are commonly used. 
The first include ibuprofen and paracetamol, which block the body’s 
‘prostaglandins’ (chemicals that produce swelling and pain) at the 
source of the pain, reducing swelling in the area and reducing the 
intensity of pain. These ‘aspirin medicines’ are used frequently for 
mild to moderate pain, but they can only work up to a certain intensity 
of pain. There are different types of painkillers within this group, such 
as anti-inflammatory medicines, like ibuprofen, which are commonly 
used to treat arthritis, sprains and strains. Aspirin is used to help lower 
the risk of blood clots when used in a low dosage, as they thin the 
blood. Paracetamol is what’s known as an analgesic, which is used for 
reducing pain and lowering a temperature. 
The second type of 
painkillers include morphine 
and codeine (narcotic 
medicines), which block  
the pain messages in the 
spinal cord and the brain. 
This is for much more 
severe pain. As both types 
of painkillers use slightly 
different methods to treat 
pain, they can be  
combined, such as in 
co-codamol, which blends 
codeine and paracetamol.

What is a 
photon?
A
photon is one of the elementary particles of the universe and 
is accountable for much of its basic structure. Photons are 
responsible for one of the fundamental forces of nature – the 
electromagnetic force – and are often regarded by many as the basic 
unit of light. They are also responsible for forces in an electromagnetic 
field and are the main constituent of light that enables it to travel 
throughout the cosmos.
Photons are basically little packets of energy, or electromagnetic 
waves, but they contain no mass or electrical charge whatsoever. They 
are released from atoms when a change in energy occurs, travel at the 
speed of light and can exist as both a wave and as a particle. When we 
see light, what we are really observing is the emission of photons from 
agitated atoms.

Why do our 
muscles ache?
Why do our muscles ache?
Learn what causes stiffness and pain in our muscles for days after exercise
N
ormally, when our muscles contract they shorten and bulge, 
much like a bodybuilder’s biceps. But if the muscle happens to 
be stretched as it contracts it can cause microscopic damage.
The quadriceps muscle group located on the front of the thigh 
is involved in extending the knee joint, and usually contracts and 
shortens to straighten the leg. However, when walking down a steep 
slope, the quadriceps contract to support your body weight as you step 
forward, but as the knee bends, the muscles are pulled in the opposite 
direction. This tension results in tiny tears in the muscle and this is 
the reason that downhill running causes so much delayed-onset pain.
A muscle is made up of billions of stacked sarcomeres, containing 
molecular ratchets that pull against one another to generate 
mechanical force. If the muscle is taut as it tries to contract, the 
sarcomeres get pulled out of line, causing microscopic damage. The 
muscle gets inflamed and fills with fluid, causing stiffness and pain.
Bending
Normally when the biceps 
muscle group contracts it 
shortens, pulling the 
forearm towards the 
shoulder.
Pain
The soreness associated 
with exercise is the result 
of repetitive stretching of 
contracted muscles.
Straightening
As the arm straightens 
out, the biceps are 
stretched, but the weight is 
still pulling down on the hand, so 
the muscles remain partly contracted 
to support it.
Stretching
As the muscle tries to 
contract, the weight pulls in 
the opposite direction, 
causing microscopic tears 
within the muscle cells.

How do we know how 
much food to eat?
Discover how the body manages to keep track of its energy  reserves
I 
n order to know how much food to eat, the human body needs 
a way of assessing how much energy it currently has in storage. 
Leptin – more commonly known as the ‘fat hormone’ – essentially 
acts as our internal fuel gauge. It is made by fat cells and tells the 
brain how much fat the body contains, and whether the supplies are 
increasing or being used up.
Food intake is regulated by a small region of the brain called the 
hypothalamus, which manages many of our hormones. When fat 
stores run low and leptin levels drop, the hypothalamus stimulates 
appetite in an attempt to increase food intake and regain lost energy. 
When leptin levels are high, appetite 
is suppressed, reducing food intake 
and encouraging the body to burn 
up fuel.
It was originally thought 
that leptin could be used as a 
treatment for obesity. However, 
although it is an important 
regulator of food intake, 
our appetite is aff ected 
by many other 
factors, from how 
full the stomach is 
to an individual’s 
emotional state or 
food preferences. 
For this reason, it’s 
possible to override the 
leptin message and gain 
weight even when fat stores 
are suffi  cient.

L
aunching a rocket takes years of planning, and the most 
important element is the launch pad and its attendant facilities. 
The launch pad cradles, fuels and powers the rocket, before it 
is unleashed. In the case of NASA’s Space Shuttle, its rocket motors 
produced 3.2 million kilograms (7 million pounds) of thrust at 
launch. The corrosive exhaust and intense flames from the engines 
were channelled through a horizontal V-shaped flame trench, which 
consisted of two 453,600-kilogram (1 million-pound) deflectors made 
from steel coated with 12.7 centimetres (five inches) of heat-resistant 
Fondu Fyre concrete, which flakes off to disperse the intense heat.
The Space Shuttle was assembled on a moving launch platform 
(MLP) at the nearby vehicle assembly building (VAB) and taken to the 
launch pad on top of a crawler transporter. At the pad, a fixed service 
structure (FSS) has a lift to gain access to any level of the rocket. 
Anchored to it is the rotating service structure (RSS) that comprises a 
clean room used to load the rocket’s cargo.
It took at least a month for 170 technicians and specialists to 
prepare, check and launch the Space Shuttle, though for less 
complex, unmanned rockets the timescale is a matter of days. During 
the countdown, all links between the FSS and the rocket were 
systematically released, and lastly at blast-off explosive bolts free 
the shuttle from the MLP. To protect the delicate components of the 
vehicle and the pad itself, the MLP is flooded with water at a rate of 3.4 
million litres (900,000 gallons) per minute to suppress the damaging 
sound waves and heat produced by the engines.

S
olar wind streams from the Sun at a blistering 400 kilometres 
(250 miles) per second. The intense heat of the corona – the 
outermost portion of the Sun’s atmosphere – energises particles 
to such a level that the Sun’s gravitational field can no longer hold 
on to them and they escape into space. Solar wind strength varies, 
creating space weather capable of disrupting technology, like global 
positioning system (GPS) satellites.
The movement of solar wind has a characteristic pattern that 
resembles a rope wobbling up and down – technically known as an 
Alfvén wave (after Hannes Alfvén). These magnetic strings can be 
observed as the greenish light that appears during the polar auroras. 
Until recently scientists have struggled to understand this unusual 
wave behaviour, but a new set of models – based on similar waves 
generated by polarised light – might enable us to understand, and even 
predict, future fluctuations in solar wind.

A
ll of the planets and nearly all asteroids in the Solar System 
orbit in the same direction (anticlockwise if you were looking 
down on the Solar System from way above the Earth’s north 
pole) – and they all orbit close to the same flat plane as well. This is 
because they, along with the Sun itself, all formed from the same 
protoplanetary nebula – a cloud of interstellar gas and dust that began 
to collapse under its own gravity around 5 billion years ago.
As the nebula became more concentrated, it flattened out and 
began to spin more quickly, and the Sun, asteroids and planets then 
condensed out of different parts of this flattened disc. 
The few objects that follow backward, or retrograde, orbits – and 
those whose orbits are sharply tilted to the lane of the Solar System – 
tend to be the result of close encounters with the disruptive gravity of 
a giant body like Jupiter.

A 
celestial wonder, the Sun is a huge star formed from a massive 
gravitational collapse when space dust and gas from a nebula 
collided, It became an orb 100 times bigger and weighing over 
300,000 times that of Earth. Made up of 70 per cent hydrogen and 
about 28 per cent helium (plus other gasses), the Sun is the centre of 
our solar system and the largest celestial body anywhere near us.
“The surface of the Sun is a dense layer of plasma at a temperature 
of 5,800 degrees kelvin that is continually moving due to the action 
of convective motions driven by heating from below,” says David 
Alexander, a professor of physics and astronomy at Rice University. 
“These convective motions show up as a distribution of what are 
called granulation cells about 1,000 kilometres across and which 
appear across the whole solar surface.”
At its core, the Sun’s temperature and pressure are so high and 
the hydrogen atoms are moving so fast that it causes fusion, 
turning hydrogen atoms into helium. Electromagnetic 
radiation travels out from the Sun’s core to its surface, 
escaping into space as electromagnetic radiation, a 
blinding light, and incredibly high levels of solar 
heat. In fact, the core of the Sun is actually hotter 
than the surface, but when heat escapes from 
the surface, the temperature rises to over 1-2 
million degrees. Professor Alexander explained 
that astronomers do not yet fully understand 
why this giant star’s atmosphere is so hot, but 
they think that it has something to do with 
magnetic fi elds.

What is an event horizon?
What makes these a black hole’s point of no return?
T
here are three basic elements to a black hole. There’s the singularity 
itself, at the heart of a black hole and made of stellar matter 
compressed to an infi nite density. Outside the singularity is the black 
hole’s interior space, where the rules of physics as we know them get bent 
and broken, and where space and time are stretched and compressed like 
putty. If your spacecraft has entered a black hole’s interior space, then it’s too 
late for you. You’re past the third component: the event horizon.
Also known as the Schwarzschild radius, this is the part that lets us know 
where black holes are by outlining them in black. It marks the point of no 
return for anything falling beyond it, as to re-cross it would require travelling 
faster than the speed of light, which – as far as we know – is impossible.
Event horizons aren’t solely attributed to black holes – they’re just a 
noteworthy phenomenon that possesses them. According to some theories 
governing the expansion of the cosmos, there are areas that won’t ever be 
observable because light will never reach us from them. So the boundary 
limit at which we can observe the universe is also an event horizon.

T
he Carina Nebula is – astronomically speaking – close to the 
Earth at only 7,500 light years away. It was formed 3 million 
years ago and, far from being an inert cloud, it contains over 
14,000 stars, with this fi gure in constant fl ux. Evidence points to the 
fact that supernova explosions are on the up in the region and new 
stars are being born all the time. Stars are conceived when gravity 
gathers up molecules of the nebula gas, packing them tightly together 
and increasing the temperature. The cloud begins to rotate faster and 
the core reaches around 10,000 Kelvin (9,700 degrees Celsius/17,500 
degrees Fahrenheit) at which point hydrogen molecules have broken 
down into their component atoms and fusion reactions start. The cloud 
then becomes a protostar – 30 times the size of the Sun.
The protostar collapses further until core pressure and temperature 
is great enough to sustain nuclear fusion. At this stage the star is 
contained in a dust envelope, a kind of exhaust from the process of 
the star’s gestation, making the star invisible to the naked eye. In time, 
pressure exerted by radiation blows the envelope away to reveal the 
new star.
This recent image from the ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) has 
revealed the Carina Nebula in unprecedented detail. The bright yellow 
star near the middle is Trumper 14, while the dark patches to the right 
are the dust envelopes disguising new stars. In the bottom-left is Eta 
Carinae; at around 100 solar masses, it is one of the biggest stars in 
the galaxy that radiates with 5 million times more power than our 
Sun. It’s near the end of its life and is expected to go supernova in an 
astronomically short amount of time. In fact, some astronomers believe 
it could explode any time in the next millennium.

es, it’s possible, but the impact required would be so large that 
the Earth would likely be destroyed. Many astronomers think 
that around 4.5 billion years ago, when the Solar System was 
forming, the Earth got a ‘big whack’, which resulted in our moon being 
formed. According to this theory, a Mars-sized object struck 
the early Earth. At this stage in the Solar System’s evolution 
both bodies would have been made mainly of molten 
material that had not yet solidified. Their iron-rich cores 
merged, while parts of their outer layers were vaporised and 
thrown into orbit around the Earth. This material eventually 
coalesced to form our rocky moon. The Earth gained angular 
momentum, and its orbit may have changed slightly.

How are solar 
tsunamis 
caused?
S 
olar tsunamis are surges of material sent crashing across the Sun 
as the result of a solar flare being launched into space. They can 
travel at speeds up to 1.6 million km (1 million miles) per hour. 
These solar tsunamis are made of hot plasma and magnetic energy. 
The first was observed by Gail Moreton in 1959, and since then several 
more studies have been conducted by the Solar and Heliospheric 
Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory 
(STEREO) spacecraft, both of which orbit the Earth. 
Solar tsunamis are formed when the Sun emits a coronal mass 
ejection (CME) – a massive burst of solar wind commonly associated 
with solar flares. Around the ejection point, a circular wave extends 
outwards in all directions and travels across the surface of the Sun at a 
super-fast rate. In February 2009, the two STEREO spacecraft watched 
as a billion-ton cloud of gas was hurled off the surface of the Sun from 
a CME. The result of this ejection was a massive solar tsunami that 
towered 100,000km (60,000 miles) high and which sped across the 
star’s surface at about 900,000km (560,000 miles) per hour. It was 
estimated to contain the same energy as 2.4 million megatons of TNT.

T
he story of why the Earth spins goes back to the formation 
of the Solar System. Roughly 4.7 billion years ago, the Solar 
System was a large swirling cloud of dust and gas. Over time 
this gradually coalesced into stars and planets, being drawn into 
these shapes by gravity. Being pulled inwards increased the angular 
momentum of the various bodies, and made them rotate faster. 
The law of inertia states that anything stationary or moving with a 
constant speed wants to continue doing so until it is acted upon by 
another body/force. Considering the Earth rotates in space, which is a 
vacuum, there is nothing to drastically slow the Earth down, which is 
why it continues to spin. Interestingly, early in its formation, the Earth 
spun up to five times faster than it does now – so it has slowed down.
The culprit is the moon, via something known as tidal locking. To 
understand tidal locking, imagine you and a friend both pull on a rope, 
but at the same time you spin in a circle around a pivot at the 
centre of the rope. As you tug harder, you are eventually 
able to spin less and less fast. Eventually, you will be 
stuck simply pulling on the rope, unable to move as 
your pulling force is too great; this is essentially 
what happened between Earth and the moon. 
As the moon orbits Earth it exerts a pull on the 
planet, responsible for causing tides. The Earth 
is much bigger so continues to spin freely, but 
the moon’s rotation now matches the time it 
takes to complete one orbit. Small as it is, the 
moon will continue to effect the Earth and, in 
millions of years, a day could last up to 26 hours.

Why is the 
surface of 
Mars red?
T 
he red colour that we usually see in images of Mars is actually 
the result of iron rusting. Rocks and soil on the surface of Mars 
contained a dust composed mostly of iron and small amounts 
of other elements such as chlorine and sulphur. The rocks and soil 
were then eroded by wind and the resulting dust was blown across the 
planet’s surface by the activity of ancient volcanoes. Recent evidence 
suggests dust was also spread across Mars by water, a theory backed 
up by the presence of channels and ducts across the planet’s surface.
 The iron contained within the dust then reacted with the oxygen 
in the atmosphere, producing the distinctive red rust colour, while 
the sky appears red because storms carried the red dust high up into 
the planet’s atmosphere. This dusty surface, which is between a few 
millimetres and two metres deep, also sits above a layer of hardened 
lava which is mostly composed of basalt. The concentration of iron 
that is found in this basalt is much higher than it is in basalt on Earth, 
and this also contributes to the red appearance of Mars.

How do 
ocean tides 
work?
Y
ou’re sitting on a beach, cooking a barbecue with the family. 
The Sun sets in the distance. You look around and – like 
the famous scene from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang – you’re 
surrounded by water. The phenomenon of ocean tides is caused by 
gravitational forces as the Earth moves around the Sun, and the moon 
moves around the Earth.
The eff ect of tides as we see them is due to gravity pulling water to 
one side of the Earth or another. It helps to think of a giant bathtub, 
with vast bodies of water being moved as the tub is tipped.
How do ocean tides work?
Gravitational forces tip ocean waters like a bathtub
Space
Earth
There are two scientifi c principles at work, says Iheanyi N Osondu PhD, an associate professor of geography at 
Fort Valley State University in Georgia. “The rotation of the Earth produces the Coriolis eff ect,” he says. “The movement 
of currents of water and air is aff ected by Coriolis. Ferrell’s law states that any object or fl uid moving horizontally in the 
northern hemisphere is defl ected to the right of its path of motion regardless of compass direction. In the southern 
hemisphere, it is defl ected towards the left.”
Gravitational pull 
It helps to think of the ocean 
as a giant bathtub fi lled with 
water: if you tipped the 
bathtub to one side, the water 
would rise. In the ocean, the 
water levels change when 
gravity pulls water to one side 
of the Earth, which causes the 
water level to lower on the 
other side.
Moon pull
A second reason for ocean tides rising 
and lowering: the ocean tends to bulge 
on the side of the Earth that is closest 
to the moon. “The moon makes one 
complete rotation round the Earth every 
29 and a half days,” says Osondu. “On the 
other hand, the Sun also infl uences the 
tides. It should, however, be noted that 
the moon has a greater infl uence on tides 
than the Sun because it is nearer, even 
though the Sun is much larger.”
Tides 
There are also three kinds of 
tides on the planet, says 
Osondu. Diurnal is when the 
tide rises and lowers once per 
day, and is common in the Gulf 
of Mexico. Semidiurnal, 
common in the Atlantic coasts, 
has two similar tides per day. 
Mixed tides, where there are 
two dissimilar tides per day, are 
common in the Pacifi c coasts.

Why does Saturn have rings?
The mysteries of how Saturn’s rings were formed are only 
now revealing themselves to us…
A
t least 60 times more powerful than its predecessors, the laser at the 
National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California is an impressive 
feat of precision engineering. It contains the largest optical 
instrument ever built, 7,500 flash-lamps, 97 kilometres (60 
miles) of mirrors and fibre optics, and is roughly the size of 
three football pitches.
At the master oscillator of the NIF, a low-energy pulse of 
photons is generated using 
an optical 
fibre laser. To 
amplify the laser pulse it 
is broken down into 192 separate beams; 
these are then carried through fibre-optic cables to a series 
of amplifiers.
Powerful white flash-lamps are used to energise sheets 
of neodymium-impregnated phosphate glass, which energises 
electrons in the neodymium atoms. As the photons pass through the 
amplifier they cause the electrons to drop back to their ‘ground state’, and

in the process more photons are released. The photons collide and vibrate 
together, creating a stream of photons all of the same wavelength and 
travelling in a single direction.
An optical switch in the amplifier works like a mirror and 
forces the photons to travel back and forth, bumping in to 
more electrons and producing more and more identical 
photons. This process boosts the power of each beam 
from a fraction of a joule to over  
 
 
 
20,000 joules. Once the beams have 
been amplified, two ten-storey mirrored ‘switchyards’ 
focus them into a spherical target chamber, pinpointing a 
target smaller than a pencil eraser. The combined power of 
all 192 beams heats the target to 100 million degrees Celsius 
(180 million degrees Fahrenheit) – more than six times hotter 
than the core of the Sun – and puts it under a force exceeding 100 
billion atmospheres, all in less than a second.

Zone?
What is the Goldilocks Zone?
Life-sustaining planets require such exacting standards that scientists call the 
area they occupy ‘the Goldilocks Zone’
T
he Goldilocks Zone is an area ‘just right’ for a life-sustaining 
planet – the perfect distance from a star with a surface neither 
too hot nor too cold. It is an intersection of life-sustaining 
regions within both a solar system and a galaxy. Astronomers believe 
that the Goldilocks Zone ranges from 0.725 to three astronomical units 
(each about 150 million kilometres, or the mean distance between the 
Earth and the Sun). 
Recently some planetary bodies have come close to fi tting the bill. 
The April 2007 discovery of Gliese 581c in the Libra constellation, 
for example, seemed promising until further research proved it was 
too hot. However, a nearby planet, Gliese 581d, may turn out to be 
just right. At the same time, the defi nition of the Goldilocks Zone is 
expanding as scientists discover life on Earth in places previously 
thought too extreme to sustain it.
Location
Solar systems must be in the right place in the galaxy 
to sustain the formation of terrestrial planets, but 
not receive high doses of radiation.
Distance from the Sun
If the Earth had formed just a few percentage points 
closer or further from the Sun, it would be either 
covered in ice or have no oceans.

How do ice 
volcanoes form?
How do ice volcanoes form?
Saturn’s freezing moon Enceladus has volcanoes, 
but they’re not what you’d expect
T
hey’re known as cryovolcanoes, and though scientists don’t 
have cast-iron proof that volcanoes spouting ice from a sub-
zero caldera exist on Enceladus, there is strong evidence for it. 
The flyover by Cassini two years ago revealed jets spurting from four 
cracks along the moon’s surface, named Alexandria, Cairo, Baghdad 
and Damascus. The eruptions were so high that they could easily be 
seen in profile from space.
Volcanoes found on Earth 
and also Jupiter’s moon 
Io spout silicate lava that 
is heated by the pressure 
beneath the crust. Ice 
volcanoes work in a similar 
way: scientists believe that 
subterranean geological 
activity on Enceladus warms 
the freezing surface into a 
slush of water, ice and  
organic compounds, which 
is then ejected out by force 
through the surface by ice 
sheets grinding up against  
one another.
Enceladus has an elliptical 
orbit similar to our moon, 
so as Saturn’s gravity pulls 
unevenly at Enceladus it 
creates a bulge that generates 
the friction and heat necessary 
to cause this previously 
unheard-of phenomenon.
Space
Enceladus’s eruptions
Tidal heating
Hard packed ice beneath 
the crust is partially melted 
into slush by the force of 
Saturn’s gravity.
Under pressure
The water ice slush is 
squeezed between the 
ice sheets on the surface.
Ice sheets
Temporary cracks 
open up in the ice 
sheets on Enceladus’s 
surface, allowing 
meltwater to escape.
Eruption
When the ice sheets clash, 
any slush caught between 
them is ejected under the 
immense pressure.

or millennia, would-be aviators knew bird flight had something 
to do with wing structure, but were clueless regarding the 
details. As it turns out, the shape of a wing is optimised to 
generate lift, an upward force caused by manipulating airflow. A wing 
has a rounded leading edge with a slight upward tilt, a curved topside, 
and a tapered trailing edge pointing downward. This shape alters 
the flow of air molecules into a downward trajectory. This results 
in – as Newton put it in his Third Law of Motion – “an equal and 
opposite reaction.” When the wing pushes the air molecules down, the 
molecules push the wing up with equal force. The airflow also creates 
a lower pressure area above the wing, which sucks the wing up. 
Constructing wings is the easy part. To fly, you need to generate 
enough forward force – or thrust – to produce the necessary lift to 
counteract gravity. The Wright Brothers accomplished this by linking 
a piston engine to twin propellers. A plane propeller is simply a group 
of rotating wings shifted 90 degrees, so the direction of lift is forwards 
rather than upwards. In 1944, engineers upgraded to jet engines, 
which produce much greater thrust by igniting a mixture of air and 
fuel, and expelling hot gasses backward. 
A pilot controls a plane by adjusting movable surfaces on the 
main wings, as well as smaller surfaces and a wing-like rudder on 
the tail. By changing the shape and position of these structures, the 
pilot varies the lift force, acting on the different ends of the plane to 
essentially pivot the plane along three axes: its pitch (up or down tilt of 
the nose), roll (side to side rotation), and yaw (turn to the left or right). 
Engineers keep planes as light and aerodynamic as possible. Modern 
fighter jets are manufactured from super-strong, lightweight composite 
material, applied in layers to form precise, aerodynamic shapes.

Drag
The mass of molecules in the air 
creates resistance to the 
forward-moving plane, causing 
backward drag that works against 
the thrust. As the plane speeds up 
and encounters more air particles 
per second, drag increases. 
Thrust
The forward thrust of the plane, generated by 
propellers, jet engines or rockets, counteracts 
drag and moves the wings through the air to 
generate lift. 
Yaw
Planes have a vertical tail rudder, 
which is similar to the rudder on a 
boat. When you tilt the rudder to the 
left, rushing air will pivot the tail to 
the right. To turn successfully, it’s 
necessary to adjust the yaw and roll 
simultaneously.
Roll
To roll the plane, the hinged wing surfaces, 
called ailerons, have to be adjusted. To roll 
right, the aileron on the right wing has to be 
raised, which reduces lift, while simultaneously 
lowering the aileron on the left wing, which 
increases lift. The left wing rises and the right 
wing drops, rolling the plane to the right.
More than a century after the Wright Brothers, physicists are still debating exactly how 
wings work. Accessible explanations for the rest of us can’t help but leave things out, and 
some common answers are fl at-out wrong.
The crucial thing to understand is that air is a fl uid, and that wings alter the fl ow of 
that fl uid. The top and bottom of the wing both defl ect air molecules downwards, which 
results in an opposite upward force. In the typical airfoil design, the top of the wing is 
curved. Flowing air follows this curve, causing it to leave the wing at a signifi cant 
downward angle. This also generates a low-pressure area above the wing, which helps 
pull it up. 
Long, skinny wings are more effi  cient because they produce minimal drag 
proportional to lift. But they’re also fragile and slow to manoeuvre. In contrast, stubby 
wings off er high agility and strength, but require more thrust to produce lift.

Lift
The relative pressure of air rushing over and under the 
wings generates the upward lift force that keeps the 
plane aloft. In a typical small plane, the force of lift equals 
about ten times the force of thrust. Lift increases with 
the wings’ surface area.
Gravity
Planes need suffi  cient lift to overcome the continual 
downward force of gravity. The heavier the plane, the 
more lift is needed – either from larger wings, greater 
thrust, or both. 
Pitch
Tail wings called stabilisers include adjustable fl aps called 
elevators. When the elevators are tilted up, they generate 
lift that forces the tail downward. The nose tilts up, 
increasing the wing’s angle of attack, causing the plane to 
climb. Tilting the elevators down lifts the tail, pitching the 
plane forward into a dive.

A
t first glance it may seem like a car is wildly out of control, 
but drifting is a highly technical form of driving involving the 
calculated shifting of balance of a vehicle, and has developed 
into one of the fastest-growing motorsports in the world. The idea 
behind it is to maintain a state of oversteer while negotiating a 
series of corners. A driver will call on constant, quick adjustments to 
the throttle, brakes, clutch, gears and steering. Only cars with rear-
wheel drive can be successfully drifted, and these are placed under 
high stress, requiring strengthened components like a clutch and 
handbrake. These cars tend to get through a good number of tyres.
Drifting is loud and creates lots of tyre smoke and the practice 
is forbidden on public roads. Specially organised drift events let 
enthusiasts practise and compete to complete a course with the best 
drifts according to a panel’s criteria.
How do you drift in a car?
It looks like just a cool trick, but drifting involves driving 
precision and unique physics
How do

in a car?
2. Counter-steer
Once the car is pointing 
directly into the inside corner 
of the bend, apply counter-
steer, as well as throttle, to 
ensure the car doesn’t spin off.
1. Approach
Head into a corner with 
high momentum, with 
plenty of revs. Steer hard 
into the corner to send 
the rear of the car sliding.
6. Exit
You can maintain 
a drift even on a straight, 
but to exit a drift come 
off the power and aim 
your wheels forward.
5. Next corner
With the car now entering the 
second corner with the rear 
swung to the other side, apply 
counter-steer again, aiming for 
the end of the corner.
4. Swing round
As the car leaves the first corner 
and you prepare for the second, 
apply full throttle under 
opposite lock in order to push 
the rear of the car swinging 
round to the other side.
3. Steering adjustment
From here, minor tweaks to 
steering and throttle will keep the 
car balanced in a state of oversteer 
through the corner. Dab the 
throttle, keeping the revs high to 
maintain control.

A 
pitstop is a motorsport operation where a racing car – such 
as those used in Formula 1 – is refuelled, fixed, adjusted or 
gets a new driver. In an F1 context, a pitstop generally entails 
changing the car’s wheels and fixing any damage.
Pitstops are carried out in the pits, a segment of track that runs 
parallel to the main circuit’s starting grid, and is broken down into a 
series of bays. Each bay is assigned to a team, with a bay consisting of 
an internal garage and an external, pit-side operations area.
When a car needs attention, the team’s communications crew calls 
the vehicle in to the pits, which involves the driver completing their 
current lap and then entering the pit lane. For safety, a set speed limit 
is imposed within the pit lane. The driver then proceeds down the 
lane and is flagged into their bay by a sign-waving crew member.
As soon as the driver is stationary, operations can begin. Once any 
repairs and adjustments have been completed, the car is released to 
travel to the end of the pit lane and then the circuit proper, where it 
merges back into the racing pack.

pneumatic wrenches 
within just a couple of 
seconds at the same 
time as the fuel hose 
is inserted.
3. Fuel hose
A dedicated team accesses the fuel port and inserts a 
high-speed hose to quickly refill its tank. This no longer 
occurs in F1 as all cars are fully fuelled to the end of the race.

car is stationary 
in the pit a series 
of jacks is used 
to lift it off the 
ground. This 
allows the tyres

T
ransmissions play a fundamental role in the process of moving 
a vehicle. A car’s transmission is connected to the engine and 
serves to ‘transmit’ the power generated there to the wheels 
that drive it. Within this, gears reduce the number of revolutions of a 
crankshaft, ensuring more eff ective use of the engine’s torque.
When a car is in neutral, power from the engine is driving 
the transmission input shaft, in turn rotating some parts in the 
transmission on idle. However, once fi rst gear is selected to go 
forwards or reverse to go backwards, the clutch is depressed, 
disengaging the input shaft from the engine. Due to inertia, the input 
shaft could still spin for some time however, meaning certain parts of 
the transmission will be spinning too fast to interlock with the gears.
A clutch brake works by fi xing to the input shaft on a manual 
gearbox, acting as a source of friction between the release bearing 
and transmission bearing retainer cap, reducing the input shaft’s rate 
of rotation and slowing the spinning inside the gearbox. This allows 
for the gears to ‘mesh’ eff ectively without any signifi cant grinding or 
clashing. Clutch brakes are instrumental in avoiding excessive wear of 
those all-important inner transmission components.
There are three common types of clutch brake found in vehicles: a 
one-piece clutch brake, a two-piece ‘hinged’ clutch brake and a torque-
limiting clutch brake. The one-piece variety can only be installed 
with the transmission removed from the vehicle, so it can go over the 
circular input shaft. Its thick plate provides a good friction surface to 
slow the input shaft when it’s spinning. A two-piece hinged clutch 
brake, on the other hand, can be installed with the transmission in 
place by hinging and then fi xing around the input shaft. Finally, a 
torque-limiting clutch brake is used for more heavy-duty applications 
and features a hub with washers that slip under a certain amount of 
torque, ensuring the smooth engagement of gears in the transmission.

How do hang 
gliders fly?
How do hang gliders fly?
Propelled solely by hot air, hang gliders make engineless flight possible 
H
ang gliders work by generating lift through their body and 
wing shape, as well as exploiting the natural meteorological 
updrafts created in Earth’s atmosphere. Through this, they use 
gravity as a source of propulsion, yet stay airborne for lengthy periods 
of time The relationship between the amount of lift the glider is 
capable of and the amount of drag inflicted on it by the atmosphere’s 
air molecules is key to its sustained flight, with the more metres of 
forward glide to every one metre of descent, the better. 
When hang gliders were first invented, their heavy construction 
materials (wood and heavy metals) prevented pilots from achieving 
a good ratio. Today, however, super-lightweight carbon composite 
materials allow gliders to have significant glide ratios, usually over 15:1.
Construction consists of two parts, the control frame and the wings. 
The wings are designed to generate as much lift as possible as air 
passes over them, and maintain pitch and yaw equilibrium when 
gliding. The triangular control frame is attached to the centre of the 
wings; it provides a fixed platform for the pilot to be strapped to and 
shift within to alter course and altitude. Control is achieved by the 
pilot moving their weight fore or aft in opposition to the frame.

Boat braking
D
iff erent boats use diff erent 
ways to propel through 
water. For boats with 
propellers, the spinning propeller 
pushes water back and this pushes 
the boat forwards. You can slow 
them by stopping the propeller 
spinning. If you spin the propeller 
backwards, the boat will push 
water forwards and this will start to 
push the boat backwards and it will 
slow down a bit faster. An anchor is 
then used to keep the boat still.

ll tyres use a form of poppet valve, with the most common 
being the Schrader valve. This consists of a hollow cylindrical 
stem that has threading outside it. Running through the centre 
of the stem is a spring-loaded pin inside a sleeve.
A small disc that is located at the bottom of the pin prevents any air 
from escaping through the sleeve, and when the pin is then pushed 
down, air is then able to escape through the valve. The strength of the 
spring determines the pressure that is needed to push it open.
Transport
Valve open
When the pin at the centre of the valve is depressed, air 
will escape. An air pump has a centre pin that depresses 
the valve pin, allowing air to be pumped into the tyre.

ey to how a bulldozer operates is its large powerful engine and 
tracks, which when combined allow the machine to push, pull 
and carry many-ton loads day in, day out, without seeming 
to struggle at all. This is because the tracks generate excellent 
ground hold and weight distribution, preventing the bulldozer from 
becoming stuck or slipping on diffi  cult terrain. This ability, 
in partnership with the vast amount of 
torque generated by the vehicle’s diesel 
engine and torque divider, allows 
substantial loads to be manipulated 
with ease – indeed, modern 
bulldozers can pull tanks that 
weigh over 70 tons!

F
unicular – or incline – railways are typified as two connected 
rail carriages running over a steeply inclined four, three or 
two-rail track. Both carriages are connected as they operate 
under the principle of counterweight. In order to overcome the 
lack of traction generated by steel rails and tram wheels, funicular 
railways use each of their pair of carriages to power and 
balance the other over a central, top-mounted pulley.
With this design, very little electrical power is required 
to haul many tons of carriage up a steep incline, with the 
only additional power needed to initialise the pulley’s 
motor. The pulley provides enough force to overcome the 
difference in weight between the carriages (ie passengers) 
as well as counteract any friction between the two forces.

predominant colour, so all buses in the 
Greater London area became red.

How do ships stay level?
Stabilisers are the secrets behind sailing straight in rough waters
How do ships 
stay level?
S
hip stabilisers come in three main categories: bilge keels, ship 
stabilisers and gyroscopic ship stabilisers. Bilge keels are long 
thin strips of metal that run in a ‘V’ shape along the length of a 
ship at the turn of the bilge (the area on the outer surface of a ship’s 
hull where the bottom curves meet the vertical sides). Bilge keels work 
by dampening a ship’s roll capability by counteracting roll pressure 
with physical hydrodynamic resistance. Ship stabilisers diff er to bilge 
keels in shape and positioning, resembling fi ns rather than gills and 
are often positioned in pairs at the stern and bow of a ship. They do, 
however, work in the same way and are usually positioned on the bilge 
in line with the ship’s bilge keel. Due to their larger size and protrusion, 
ship stabilisers off er greater resistance to ship roll but negatively aff ect 
its manoeuvrability and increase its hull clearances when docking.
Gyroscopic ship stabilisers are complex fi n systems that can be 
incrementally adjusted in their angle of attack (a vector representing 
the relative motion between lifting body and the fl uid through which 
it is moving) to counteract roll, and brought in and out of the hull at 
will thanks to specially tailored hydraulic mechanisms.

Why can these machines

T
he ability of hovercraft to cross dry land as 
well as water has seen them employed in the 
military and tourism sectors for many 
years. Although once billed as the next generation 
of transportation, they have somewhat decreased 
in popularity over the last decade. Despite this, their 
usefulness is still readily apparent.
The core principle of a hovercraft is that the hull of 
the vehicle is suspended on top of a giant cushion of air, 
held in place by flexible rubber that allows it to traverse 
difficult terrain or choppy waves without being torn 
apart. At the centre of a hovercraft is a huge fan that fires 
air downwards, pushing the hull off the ground as high as 
two metres (6.5 feet). Smaller fans on top of the hull push 
air backwards, giving the hovercraft forward momentum. 
Rudders direct this flow of horizontal air to allow a 
hovercraft to change its direction.
Traditional hovercraft have an entirely rubber base that 
allows for travel on land or sea, but others have rigid sides 
that, while suited only to water, can have propellers or 
water-jet engines attached for a quieter craft.

115
Transport
Plenum chamber 
The region of trapped air underneath the 
craft is known as the ‘plenum chamber’, which 
controls the escape of air to create a high-pressure 
environment and thus a circulation of controllable air.
Lift 
When the pressure 
of air underneath

greater than the 
weight of the 
hovercraft, the 
vehicle will rise  
up to a height of a 
few metres.
Hovergap 
When the amount of 
air escaping through 
the gap between the 
skirt and the ground 
(hovergap) is being 
equally replaced by air 
from the lift fan, the 
hovercraft is at its 
maximum height.
Air 
Hovercraft float on 
top of a large 
cushion of air  
that greatly 
reduces drag and 
friction, allowing 
the vehicle to  
travel over almost

Hull 
The hull is where you’ll 
find the driver, 
passengers and cargo 
of the hovercraft. It sits 
on top of the cushion 
of air that keeps the 
vehicle aloft.
Thrust fans 
The hovercraft gains its 
propulsion from these 
backwards-facing fans, 
normally mounted on 
the back of the vehicle. 
Some use ducted fans 
while others favour 
naked propellers.
Rudders 
Flaps at the back control the 
hovercraft like an aircraft, directing 
airflow in certain directions to allow 
it to be steered.
Lift fan 
Air is pumped into the plenum chamber by 
the main fan in the centre of a hovercraft. 
Although some hovercraft divert air from 
the thrust fans instead, lift fan designs 
are much easier to construct.

How do 
kayaks  
stay afloat?
K 
ayaks are small, narrow boats – most commonly single-seater 
– designed to transport their user over a variety of watery 
environments, be that calm, flat lakes, choppy coastal waters 
or torrential river rapids. Due to their ability to traverse such varied 
terrains, kayaks can take many forms. For example, racing kayaks are 
long and narrow – often exceeding six metres (19 feet) in length – to 
reduce drag and maximise the distance per stroke generated by the 
paddler’s oar. On the other hand, white-water kayaks are short and 
squat, often measuring in at no more than 1.5 metres (five feet) as 
stability and the ability to turn sharply are the key requirements when 
navigating jagged rocks and steep drops.
Indeed, when you consider this rather diverse usage, it won’t come 
as a surprise to discover that there are over six main categories of 
kayak, including: recreational, oceanic, white-water, racing, surf and 
hybrid types.
How do kayaks stay 
afloat in rough waters?
A look inside these versatile boats
Rudder
Due to their great length, sprint 
kayaks can be fitted with a small 
rudder to aid turning, which is 
controlled by the paddler’s feet.
Beam
The beam, or widest part, of a 
kayak, is rarely much wider than 
the kayaker’s width. This greatly 
reduces the drag experienced by 
the kayak.
Chassis
Modern kayak chassis are constructed 
from carbon fibre, fibreglass or wood. 
This ensures a light weight and 
therefore higher speed.

Can you

sound barrier?
W
hen Chuck Yeager broke the sound 
barrier with the Bell X-1 rocket plane 
in 1947, he was doing something that 
many people thought would never be possible. The 
sound barrier is simply the point an object exceeds 
the speed of sound – a speed many scientists once 
considered impossible. 
Sound is a travelling wave of pressure. A moving 
object pushes nearby air molecules, which push 
the molecules next to them, and so on. As a plane 
approaches the speed of sound, its pressure waves 
‘stack up’ ahead of it to form a massive area of 
pressurised air, called a shock wave. Shock waves 
would shake old planes violently, creating an 
apparent ‘barrier’ to higher speeds. 
You can hear shock waves as sonic booms. 
Sometimes they’re even visible: the high  
pressure area can cause water vapour to condensate 
into liquid droplets, briefly forming a cloud around 
the plane.

sound barrier?

are used to carry and launch large missiles and rockets. These 
comprise thin narrow rails mounted under an aircraft’s fuselage, to 
which missiles are attached by a basic slot mount. These rail systems 
work by simply dropping the missile on command from the mount, 
with the weapon then propelling itself clear of the plane under the 
power of its own ignited engine and kinetic energy. 
Ejector racks make up the second type of hardpoint, although 
technically speaking the rack is not a hardpoint but is attached to one  
via a pylon. Ejector racks consist of braces of free-fall bombs and 
small rockets in a close-knit array hung beneath a plane’s wings. 
The positioning of the rack away from the wing surface ensures that 
control surfaces are not disrupted. The ejector racks also work by 
physically pushing the bomb/missile free, this time using explosive 
cartridges, which when engaged destroy the rack’s weapon hooks. 
To make sure the primed weapon is definitely released, each rack is 
equipped with both primary and secondary charges, as a backup.
The third station is the wet hardpoint. These are referred to as 
‘wet’ as they are plumbed and capable of interfacing with drop tanks 
mounted on them. This allows an aircraft to carry extra stores of fuel 
outside of its primary reservoir, supplementing its maximum combat 
range. Importantly, despite their connection to the aircraft’s fuel tank, 
wet hardpoints can still be jettisoned when empty to reduce weight 
and drag, and also be used to mount additional weaponry if needed.

How do snowmobiles work?
Read on to fi nd out how these vehicles traverse icy terrain
I
n the pursuit of getting from A to B as quickly as possible, it was 
only a matter of time before traditional skis were replaced when 
traversing snow and ice, and the snowmobile invented. The roots 
for this snowy-terrain vehicle are in military technology, where the 
rubber in the off -road tracks was proven to work even in adverse 
winter conditions.
A Canadian inventor called Joseph Armand Bombardier took the 
design, adapted and refi ned it to create the fi rst single-passenger 
snowmobile in 1959: the Ski-Doo. Bombardier Industries has gone on 
to be a leader in the snowmobile market, while the snowmobile itself 
has become the de facto standard for fast travel across ice and snow-
dominated landscapes.
Engine
A similar design to 
engines found in 
jetskis, it has a large 
gear mechanism that 
turns the tracks.
Clutch
The engine uses a primary and 
secondary clutch system to ensure 
smooth gear changing at all times. 
Tracks
The 38cm (15in)-wide tracks are 
similar to those on tanks, except 
made of rubber or aluminium. 
They can be equipped with studs 
too, for extra traction.
Skis
Wheels are near 
useless in snow, 
while skis spread 
the weight of the 
vehicle across a 
larger surface 
area.
Handlebars
Tanks and construction vehicles use variable track 
speeds to steer, while snowmobiles use the 
handlebars to turn the skis.
Shock absorbers
This component has improved through 
the decades. Shocks not only help you 
maintain control but also make the ride 
much more comfortable.
Chassis
A snowmobile 
chassis needs to 
be as strong and 
as light as 
possible: this 
model is just 
over 180kg 
(400lb).

Transport
What are decoy fl ares?
Confusing missiles to avoid destruction
D
ecoy fl ares work by generating a heat signature in excess of the launch 
vehicle’s jet engines. This has the eff ect of confusing any incoming heat-
seeking missile’s homing system into locking on to the fl ares’ signatures 
instead of the aircraft’s, causing it to explode at a safe distance and saving the pilot’s 
life. There are two main types of countermeasure fl are – pyrophoric and pyrotechnic. 
The former is activated automatically on contact with air and the latter by the 
mechanical removal of a friction cap prior to fi ring. The composition of either type of 
fl are is often tailored to counter specifi c missile systems or to mimic the launch jet’s 
heat signature.

M
edieval castles were an important part of feudal society. 
They began to appear around 1066 AD with the invasion 
of William the Conqueror. As he moved through England, 
Scotland and Wales, William had more than 30 castles built to help 
maintain power over his newly conquered lands. 
These castles served as bases for lords who held land from the king 
and pledged loyalty and military service to him in return. These lords 
leased parts of their land to lesser lords and barons, who had knights 
that served under them.
These imposing structures had multiple functions. 
Castles were bases of offensive operations, defensive 
strongholds, seats of government and private 
residences for land-holding barons, knights 
and lords and their families. Most were built 
in stages over long periods of time and 
modified as greater defences were needed. 
Although their structures varied, they 
generally consisted of a tall building 
in the centre, which could function 
as a residence, prison or storage area, 
surrounded by one or more walls. Some 
castles were built on a mountain or hilltop, 
or on the edges of cliffs, to make invasion 
that little bit more difficult.

W
hile the concept of roads had existed for hundreds of years 
prior to the Romans, it was through the Roman Republic’s 
– and later Roman Empire’s – widespread use of them 
throughout Italy and beyond that most of ancient Europe became so 
well connected. In addition, they contributed heavily to the spread of 
the territories under Roman control as they enabled troops, supplies 
and traders to quickly travel from place to place.
Roman road construction was heavily institutionalised, with set 
materials and designs. Roads were of a certain width and depth, 
consisting of a number of layers built up from a pre-dug trench. 
The roads were also split up, depending on their size, ownership 
and purpose. For example, viae publicae were large main roads, 
maintained through public taxation, while viae privatae were funded 
and built by private individuals. While Roman construction rules did 
indicate roads should be built straight wherever it was possible, this 
was not in practice typical, with only major high roads built that way.
How were Roman roads built?
How were these ancient highways made, and were they always straight?

1. Earth
All roads were built on a

expanse of earth, which 
served as the base.
2. Stones
On top of the earth was placed
a layer of small, compacted stones.
3. Rubble
On top of the small 
stones was a layer of 
rubble, which was created 
from crushed stone and lime.
4. Lime 
A bedding
of pounded
pot shards and 
lime was then 
deposited over 
the rubble and

5. Lava
The four previous layers were 
then capped with polygonal 
blocks of basaltic lava or 
a similar hard stone.
6. Edge
On either side of the capping layer –

stones were positioned
to demarcate the 
pavements.

T
yrannosaurus rex – from Greek and Latin words meaning 
‘tyrant’, ‘lizard’ and ‘king’ – was one of the largest carnivorous 
dinosaurs to walk the earth. Likely prey included the 
Triceratops horridus and the Torosaurus, each about the size of an 
elephant. There have been several nearly complete Tyrannosaurus rex 
skeletons found since the fi rst bones were discovered in 1894, some of 
which included soft tissue. From these, palaeontologists have learned 
that the T-rex had a lot of bird-like traits. It likely had a one-way air 
sac system that kept its lungs constantly full of fresh air, hollow 
bones to lighten its body weight, and binocular, colour sight. It also 
had a wishbone, or furcula. Some palaeontologists believe that our 
assumptions of scaly, lizard-like skin might not be entirely accurate 
and that T-rex could’ve even had feathers.
Controversy about the T-rex centres on whether it was a predator 
or a scavenger, as well as whether it moved slowly or quickly. Many 
palaeontologists believe that the Tyrannosaurus rex was strictly a 
predator, but those who question this assumption point to its short, 
weak arms with two-fi ngered hands, large legs 
suited for walking distances and a strongly 
developed sense of smell. These seem 
more in line with what we know of 
scavengers rather than predators. Others 
argue that muscle scars found on 
skeletons show that the 
T-rex had strong arms. 
They also believe 
that their binocular sight 
and hollow bones indicate a 
faster-moving predator. However, 
predators today will sometimes 
scavenge if fresh prey isn’t around, so T-rex 
could’ve actually been both.
How did T-rex hunt its prey?

dinosaurs, but it might not have been a predator at all

P
ompeii was a medium-sized Roman city in the Italian region of 
Campania. In 79 CE, however, it was completely destroyed in the 
eruption of nearby Mount Vesuvius, a stratovolcano located close 
to the city of Naples.
The destruction of Pompeii (and other cities; see below) was caused 
according to stratigraphic studies in two main phases. The fi rst phase 
was a Plinian eruption, which is typifi ed by a colossal ejection of gas 
and volcanic ash high into the stratosphere. This phase lasted roughly 
20 hours and produced a rain of pumice in a southwards-reaching 
cone that stretched for over 32 kilometres (20 miles).
The second – and for the people of Pompeii, even more deadly 
– phase was a Peléan eruption, which consisted of a number of 
vast pyroclastic fl ows. These fl ows were fast-moving currents of 
superheated gas (at roughly 1,000 degrees Celsius/1,800 degrees

received roughly 2m (6.6ft) 
of ash over six pyroclastic 
surges. Nevertheless, its 
port was annihilated.

Fahrenheit) and rock that rapidly dispersed at ground level into the 
surrounding area. The combination of both these phases led to the 
burning and asphyxiation of all life that stood in harm’s way.
In addition, the eruption caused a small tsunami in the nearby Bay 
of Naples, rendering escape attempts by boat impossible, and a series 
of tremors that aided the destruction of dwellings and temples.
Today, over a thousand casts have been made from impressions 
of bodies trapped in Vesuvius’s ash and flow deposits discovered in 
and around Pompeii, along with various other scattered remains. Out 
of the total found, 38 per cent were discovered in ash fall, with the 
remaining 62 per cent found in surge deposits. Unfortunately, due to 
a lack of official documentation from the time, what percentage these 
represent of Pompeii’s total population is unknown.
Since the eruption of 79 CE, Vesuvius has erupted more than 
30 times, the last occurring in March 1944. Despite this, the area 
surrounding Mount Vesuvius continues to be lived in by many 
Italians, with the entire region in its immediate vicinity colonised.  
To combat the potential for disaster, the Italian government  
foresees the need for an emergency evacuation of over 600,000 
people and has marked a ‘Red Zone’ for those areas that would be 
most affected.

How did drawbridges work?
These fold-up entrances were simple yet eff ective
How did 
drawbridges 
work?
Windlass
When operated by lever or 
rotary wheel, it turns the 
lifting drums to draw in or 
let out the chains.
Pit
When the drawbridge is 
up, the counterweights 
drop into a pit in the 
gatehouse fl oor.
Counterweights
Without counterweights, 
the hefty bridge would 
be too much for the 
windlass system.
Portcullis
This metal and wood 
gate can be slid or 
dropped across the 
entrance to bar intruders.
Chain
The bridge’s chains extend from the far 
end of the bridge, through the 
gatehouse’s exterior and on to the 
lifting drums. Each chain wraps around 
its drum as the bridge is lifted.
Bridge
The bridge itself
is constructed out of 
wood and pivoted on a 
metal cylinder at the 
base of the gatehouse. 
Its underside is 
commonly reinforced 
with metal plate.
Moat
A water-fi lled moat or ditch 
is a common feature of 
castles, with the drawbridge 
providing the only dry entry.
Lifting drum
Wooden and metal 
cylinders positioned in 
the roof of the gatehouse 
– when turned by the 
windlass – draw in the 
bridge’s chains to raise it.
C
lassical drawbridges worked via the principle of counterweight, 
with large wood and metal bridges pivoted via a series of 
balancing weights in a castle’s gatehouse. The weights, which 
were attached to the bridge’s lifting chains, enabled the platform to be 
raised via a windlass, which in turn rotated a pair of lifting drums that 
gathered in the chains. By employing counterweights, heavy bridges 
could be operated by just a few people. Along with a moat, a reinforced 
drawbridge served as a two-fold barrier, making it much more diffi  cult 
for any enemies to invade a fortifi cation or city.

History
T
he Rialto Bridge is one of only four bridges that span the 
Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. It was commissioned in the 
late-16th century to replace the previous wooden structure, 
which was prone to collapse. Blueprints were submitted by the most 
eminent architects of Renaissance 
Italy, including Michelangelo, but the 
commission ended up going to the 
relatively unknown Antonio da Ponte 
in 1588, whose revolutionary design 
featuring a single broad arch was 
completed in 1591. Today, the Rialto 
Bridge is one of the most visited tourist 
sites in the city.

T
he local architects and city officials designed the complex at 
Piazza dei Miracoli (the Square of Miracles) as a dedication 
to art, and as such it is thought the principles of science and 
engineering were not fully understood. 
The tower was built in three stages over a period stretching nearly 
two centuries. The first part of the tower was built during a time of 
town prosperity and as such heavy white marble was used for the  
base and tower, with limestone used for the interior and exterior 
design features.
Disaster occurred just five years after work began, as the workers 
finalised the interior of the third floor. The tower was sinking because 
the weight of the marble building was too much for the extremely 
insufficient three-metre foundations which had been set in weak and 
unstable soil that contained a malleable mixture of clay, sand and 
rubble. The construction was halted for nearly a century to allow the 
soil to settle. In 1272 work recommenced as engineers began to build 
the tower’s middle section. 
To compensate for the continuing problem of its lean, the workers 
built one side of the wall taller than the other. Subsequently the 
tower began to lean in the opposite direction and caused it to curve. 
War caused a break in construction and the seventh floor was not 
completed until 1319 and the eighth level, featuring the belfry, was 
finally added in 1372.

Why does 
the Tower of 
Pisa lean?
133
History
In 1964 a desperate Italian Government requested 
aid to stop the tower from toppling. One of the first 
methods to be tested was to add 800 tons of lead 
counterweights to the raised end of the base, but 
this only added to its subsidence. With the problem 
worsening it was decided to close the tower in 1990 
and remove the bells to relieve some of the weight.
Cables were cinched around the third level and 
grounded several hundred metres away to anchor 
the weight. Work began on removing some 38 
cubic tons of soil from under the raised end of the 
base, which straightened the tower by 18 inches – 
regaining an angle last recorded in 1838. Ten years 
of corrective stabilisation followed and the tower 
reopened to the public in 2001. In 2008 another 70 
tons of earth was excavated and for the first time 
the structure has officially stopped moving.
Foundations 
Made of white marble, the 
construction began in 1173 during a 
time of prosperity in Pisa thanks to 
the success of its military. 
First floor interior 
Lining the inside the first floor is a series of arches in a 
typical Romanesque blind arcade style, intersected 
with columns displaying classical Corinthian capitals.
Third floor 
Upon reaching this level, engineers noticed the 
tower was starting to sink. The heavy white marble 
had become too heavy for the foundations set in soil.
Shape 
The tower has a cylindrical body encircled with arches 
and columns. The central body is a hollow shell which 
features an external wall of white and grey limestone.
Spiral 
staircase 
The inner wall 
was fashioned 
from worked 
limestone and  
comprises a 
296-step spiral 
staircase.
Curvature 
In 1272 architects 
fashioned a 
corrective axial 
inclination where 
the walls on one 
side of the tower 
were  taller than 
the other – giving 
the building its 
concave 
appearance.
Bell tower 
The Bell chamber was added in 1372. It features 
seven bells – one for each note of the musical scale. 
The largest of which was installed in 1655.

How was 
pottery made?
History
Modelling wheel
The potter shapes 
the clay material on 
this plate, which 
rotates at high 
speed while they 
model the object.
Tools 
While pots are 
moulded with the 
hands, a number of 
small tools help the 
potter make incisions 
and add decoration.
T
he potter’s wheel enabled us to easily create round ceramic 
wares such as pots and gourds. The machine worked by 
supplying the potter with a rotating circular platform upon 
which, via hand moulding, clay could be shaped as desired. The 
rotation was provided by a large kick wheel, which once set in motion 
– the potter literally kicked it, hence the name – supplied energy to 
a smaller modelling wheel, which sat above on a metal shaft. As the 
kick wheel was much bigger than the modelling wheel, it acted as a 
fl ywheel, storing rotational energy that could be used to power the 
modelling plate, which due to its smaller circumference, span at a 
greater speed.
Thanks to its ease of use, the potter’s wheel remained the method of 
choice for making pottery for many millennia, eventually evolving to 
be driven by a motor.
Wheel shaft
Both wheels are 
connected through 
the centre of the 
wooden frame by a 
metal shaft.
Kick wheel
The potter kicks this wheel to start it 
rotating. It acts as a fl ywheel, storing 
energy and forcing the connected 
modelling plate to spin at high speed.

The wooden frame 
provides support for

surface for the potter 
to work on.

t’s likely that a combination of

the onset of ice ages to falling levels

Earth’s orbit around the Sun also play 
a role, controlling how much solar

How did these ancient systems harness the power of water 
to perform a variety of tasks?
W
ater mills were – and in rare circumstances still are – 
facilities in which moving water was used as the driving 
force to power a milling apparatus. The key component in 
a water mill was a waterwheel, although in later times turbines were 
also employed, which converted the kinetic and potential energy of 
water into rotational mechanical energy to drive various machines. 
Most commonly the mill would grind grain to produce flour.
Historically there have been different types of water mill, each 
largely determined by the type of wheel they used. The kind of wheel 
chosen was dictated by the local geography and the source of water, 
with rivers on flat plains requiring an undershot waterwheel, while 
those dropping from elevated positions allowing for more efficient 
designs, like overshot wheels. Today, water mills are used far less 
due to the availability of more efficient energy-production systems; 
however, some mills still operate for demonstrative purposes.
History
1. Input flow
Water from a river or stream is 
diverted to flow over a paddle-wheel 
through a chute.
2. Water drops
The water falls from 
height into the wheel’s 
slatted wells, causing 
them to fill up and 
push the wheel 
downwards.
6. Output flow
As the filled wells reach  
ground level, their contents are 
deposited back into the waterway, 
flowing out of the system.
4. Cogs
The rotational energy generated by the 
wheel is transferred to the mill via a 
series of cogs and gears.
5. Mill
The energy is carried by the 
gears to machinery inside, which 
– in this example – is grinding 
wheat to produce flour.
3. Wheel rotation
The downwards motion of the 
wells causes the wheel to turn, 
converting the kinetic energy of the 
water into rotational energy.

M
usketeers were an early form of soldier who were armed with 
muskets. They acted as a bridge unit between traditional 
infantry  and dragoons, a type of light cavalry armed 
with long-ranged weapons. This granted them a level of versatility 
and flexibility most prized on the battlefield, with musketeer units 
typically reserved for the protection of nobility or royalty.
While musketeers as a unit are older, they didn’t emerge in Europe 
until the 16th century, with the concept only really taking off on a 
large scale in the early-17th century. While this particular era was 
dominated by the French musketeers of the Maison du Roi (the Royal 
Household) – upon which the fictional musketeers of Dumas’s The 
Three Musketeers are based – Spain, Britain, Russia, Sweden, Poland 
and even India each developed their own musketeer units in 
this period and used them on the battlefield.
Musketeers as a common military unit were largely 
phased out by the middle of the 19th century, 
with developments in firearms rendering the 
musket obsolete. With the introduction of the 
rifle – which could shoot both farther and much 
faster than the musket – the rifleman unit could 
emerge, negating the need for the greater speed 
of the mounted musketeer. This, combined 
with the decline of many dynasties throughout 
Europe – like the Ancien Régime of France – saw 
all musketeer units permanently disbanded.

They fought in battles and protected esteemed 
rulers all the way from France to India

musketeers?

History
© Ian Jackson
Musket
The musketeer’s primary 
weapon, the musket was 
deadly albeit cumbersome 
to use. Its slow reload rate 
restricted use to four shots 
per minute at best.
Sword
As musketeers 
were trained to 
fight both on 
horseback like 
dragoons and on 
foot like infantry, 
they were also 
equipped with a 
sword for 
hand-to-hand 
engagements.
Hat
Musketeers started 
off in the West 
wearing simply 
ornate hats, but by 
the early-19th 
century these 
evolved into metal 
helmets. They did 
remain decorative 
though, often with 
large feathered 
plumes attached.
Boots
Boots were an 
important part ofthe 
musketeer’s uniform, 
both communicating 
their prestigious 
position and providing 
good support on the 
ground and on 
horseback (some had 
spurs attached).
Tunic
Considerably more 
elaborate than standard 
infantry, musketeer tunics 
and – in later periods – 
cuirasses, favoured 
manoeuvrability over 
armoured protection.
Cape
A feature associated 
more with earlier 
iterations of musketeers, 
the cape offered some 
protection from the 
elements while 
travelling.
Bandolier
Bandoliers (a pocketed belt) and 
ammunition pouches/bags were a 
common accessory for musketeers, 
so they were always well supplied on 
the battlefield. These belts were 
strapped around the waist or chest.
Holdall
As musketeers 
were on the road 
during much of 
their military 
service, each 
carried their own 
holdall to store 
food and personal 
belongings.

Who wrote  
the Magna
Carta?
T
he Magna Carta, or Great Charter, is an English medieval 
document drawn up in 1215 by King John’s barons in feudal 
times. The barons were tired of having a king who could  
punish according to whim and the Magna Carta was a document  
that sought to curtail this power and give every freeman (non-serf) 
certain rights.
King John signed the document, although his intent was simply 
to bring the barons over to his side, as civil war was brewing and 
Prince Louis of France was threatening to invade. He had no intention 
of honouring the document. But after King John’s death in October 
1216, the Magna Carta was copied and frequently used to show the 
sovereign was bound by law. Indeed, it has proved to be one of the 
most important civil rights movements in British history.
A 1297 copy of the Magna Carta has been preserved by the National 
Archives Conservation Lab by putting it in a case filled with the noble 
gas argon to prevent damage from oxidation. The case itself was 
hollowed out of a 15-centimetre (six-inch) block of aluminium in order 
to reduce creases through which the gas might leak.

What is the 
Terracotta 
Army?
T
he Terracotta Army, unearthed in 1974, is one of the most 
exciting archaeological finds in recent history. The figures 
represent the soldiers of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of 
China. They had been placed in his tomb, an earthen pyramid mound, 
which was excavated beneath Mount Li. Construction had begun 
when the emperor was a child – it took many years to build. The tomb 
represents the royal palace, and the figures inside, court residents. 
Beside the warriors, archaeologists found models of officials and 
entertainers. There are 8,000 soldiers, each depicted with weapons 
such as spears, bows and arrows. There are also models of horses 
and chariots. Made out of yellow clay, the Terracotta Warriors were 
meant to protect the emperor in the afterlife. Artisans first made the 
limbs and heads which were then fired in a kiln. Once assembled, the 
models were painted and coated with a preservative, but only some 
colours are still visible. Each figure was given individual features, with 
details added to the hair and clothes; artists even added muscle tone 
to the arms and legs. The height of the soldier depended on his rank – 
ie the military generals are the tallest figures in the group.

T
he only surviving warship to have fought in the American 
War of Independence, the French Revolutionary War and 
the Napoleonic wars, the HMS Victory is one of the most 
famous ships ever to be built. An imposing fi rst rate ship of the 
line – line warfare is characterised by two lines of opposing vessels 
attempting to outmanoeuvre each other in order to bring their 
broadside cannons into best range and angle – the Victory was 
an oceanic behemoth, fi tted with three massive gundecks, 104 
multiple-ton cannons, a cavernous magazine and a crew 
of over 800. It was a vessel capable of blowing 
even the largest enemy vessels out of the water 
with magnifi cent ferocity and range, while 
also outrunning and outmanoeuvring 
other aggressors.
Historically, it was also to be Vice-
Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson’s fl agship 
during the epic naval battle off  the 
Cape of Trafalgar, where it partook in 
the last great line-based confl ict of the 
age, one in which it helped to grant 
Nelson a decisive victory over the 
French and Spanish but at the cost of 
his own life.

History
What’s 
inside HMS 
Victory?
143
 A ship’s decks 
Masts
The HMS Victory 
sported a bowsprit (the 
pole extending beyond 
the ship’s head), fore 
mast, main mast, 
mizzen mast and 
main yard. A total of 26 
miles (41.9km) of 
cordage, as well as 
768 elm and ash 
blocks, were used 
to rig the ship.
Cannons
As a fi rst rate ship
of the line, the Victory was 
a three-gundeck warship 
with over 100 guns In fact, 
the Victory was fi tted with 
104 cannons: 30 x 2.75 ton 
long pattern 32-pounders 
on the gundeck, 28 x 2.5 
ton long 12-pounders on 
the middle gundeck, 30 x 
1.7 ton short 12-pounders 
on the upper gundeck, 12 x 
1.7 ton short 12-pounders 
on the quarterdeck, and 2 x 
medium 12-pounders and 2 
x 68-pounder carronades 
on the forecastle.
Crew
There were 
over 800 people 
on board the HMS 
Victory, including gunners, 
marines, warrant offi  cers and powder 
monkeys among many others. Life on board 
was hard for the sailors, who were paid very 
little for their services and received poor food 
and little water. Disease was rife too, and 
punishments for drunkenness, fi ghting, desertion 
and mutiny ranged from fl ogging to hanging. 
The poop deck
Located at the stern, this short deck takes its name from 
the Latin word puppis, which literally means ‘after deck’ or 
‘rear deck’. This deck was used for signalling, but also gave 
some protection to the man helming the ship’s wheel.
The hull
The largest storage area 
where up to six months of 
food & drink could be stored.
The orlop
A storage area and habitation 
deck for certain crew 
members like the purser.
The gundecks
Housed most of the cannons, 
with a tiered arrangement 
from top to bottom (largest 
on the bottom). 
The quarterdeck
The nerve centre of the 
ship, where its 
commander dictated its 
manoeuvres and actions.
Sails
The HMS Victory is a fully rigged ship, with three 
sets of square sails covering 5,440m2. The 
breadth of the Victory’s sails allowed it to 
sport a top speed of nine knots when 
operational, which was for the time 
very impressive considering its 
size. During the 18th and 
19th centuries a fully 
rigged ship necessitated 
three or more masts 
each of which with 
square rigging.
