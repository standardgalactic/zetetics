Learning, defined as a change in behaviour evoked by experience, has
hitherto been investigated almost exclusively in multicellular neural organ-
isms. Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant,
and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in
single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable
form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our
experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or
caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore qui-
nine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when
the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle
criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness
decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory
adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results
point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a
hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime
moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental
mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning
in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a
comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the
tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.
1. Introduction
Learning and memory are indisputably two of the key features of animal success
[1]. Using information about past experiences is often critical for optimal decision-
making in a fluctuating environment and is involved in every aspect of an
animal’s life, including foraging and interacting with other individuals [1]. We
usually think of learning as a trait that is limited to organisms with brains and ner-
vous systems. Indeed, learning is often equated with neuronal changes such as
synaptic plasticity, implicitly precluding its existence in non-neural organisms
[1,2]. While the evolutionary benefits of learning are clear, very little is known
about its origins. Even the ‘simplest’ organisms adapt to changing environments,
raising the exciting possibility that mechanisms for learning might pre-date the
evolution of nervous systems, possibly existing in a breadth of as yet unstudied
organisms. Tantalizing results suggest that the hallmarks for learning can occur
at the level of single cells [3–6]. If true, then studies of unicellular model species
displaying learning abilities promise exciting insights to the earliest manifes-
tations of learning, a key innovation in the history of life. However, evidence
for learning in single-celled organisms remains scant and, to date, very few
unequivocal reports of such processes have been described [3,4]. For example,
the fact that bacteria respond faster to a signal already encountered in the past
or the fact that they are able to predict environmental changes has been recog-
nized as ‘learning’ by some researchers [6–8]. However, for others, it should be
called adaptation [9,10] or plasticity [11], because in most experiments bacteria
did not learn to respond to the stimulus within a lifetime but rather they evolved
to respond over multiple generations. In this paper, we attempt to demonstrate

learning in a single-celled organism Physarum polycephalum
within a single lifetime.
Physarum polycephalum, also known as the true slime
mould, is a unicellular but multi-nucleated eukaryote. Slime
moulds have been known for decades to display complex
behaviours, including finding their way through a maze
[12], solving nutritional challenges [13], avoiding traps [14]
and anticipating periodic events [15]. However, despite
their increasing recognition as a model for studies of complex
behaviours, very little is known about their learning abilities.
In this paper, using a habituation paradigm, we explore the
learning capacity of these non-neural organisms.
Habituation, one of the simplest forms of learning, is
defined as a decline in a behavioural response in response to
a repeated, irrelevant stimulus. The processes do not involve
sensory adaptation or sensory fatigue or motor fatigue. If the
stimulus is withheld, then the behavioural response recovers
to its original state over time [16,17]. Habituation of the gill
and siphon withdrawal reflex in Aplysia is a textbook example
of such a process [18]. Habituation phenomena have been
observed across many phyla of the animal kingdom from
invertebrates to vertebrates [16,17]. Herewe designed a protocol
to investigate habituation phenomena in slime moulds using
chemotaxis as the behavioural response under scrutiny.
Chemotaxis is the directed motion of an organism towards
favourable chemicals (attractants) and away from unfavourable
ones (repellents) [19,20]. To test whether slime moulds are
capable of habituation, individuals were repeatedly exposed
to quinine or caffeine, known repellents for P. Polycephalum
[21,22] and their behavioural responses were recorded.
2. Material and methods
(a) Species
We used plasmodia of the slime mould P. polycephalum (Hakodate
University) exhibiting a typical yellow colour. They are large
amoeba-like cells, scaling up to several square metres, usually
inhabiting shady, cool and humid environments such as forest
litter. They can crawl over their support in search for food by
extending tubular structures called pseudopods. For this exper-
iments, plasmodia were cultured in large Petri dishes (Ø 145 mm)
on a 1% agar gel containing 10% of blended oat flakes (Quaker
Oats Companyw) at 258C in the dark.
Before starting the experiment, to accustom the slime moulds
to the set-up, we introduced 416 slime moulds resting on their rear-
ing substrate (H ¼ 2 mm, Ø ¼ 18 mm) in experimental arenas
(Petri dish Ø ¼ 90 mm). The slime moulds were taken directly
from the culture using a template. Then, we connected each
slime mould with a food patch (1% agar gel containing 10% of
blended oat flakes, H ¼ 2 mm, Ø ¼ 18 mm) using an agar gel
bridge (1% agar gel, H ¼ 2 mm, L ¼ 13 mm, W ¼ 15 mm). The
slime mould explored the bridge by expanding pseudopods.
When it found the food patch it left both the bridge and its initial
position to exploit the food patch. After 24 h, the slime mould rest-
ing on the food patch was transferred to a new arena and the
experiment started. Six individuals failed in crossing the bridge
and were excluded from the experiment.
(b) Habituation experiment
The experiment consisted of three treatments: quinine treatment
(Q, n ¼ 140), caffeine treatment (CAF, n ¼ 70) and control treat-
ment (C, n ¼ 200), which are described below. The experiment
lasted 9 days and was organized in four different phases.
(i) Habituation phase
The habituation phase lasted for 5 days. In treatment C, slime
moulds had to reach a new food patch crossing an agar gel
bridge (1% agar gel, H ¼ 2 mm, L ¼ 13 mm, W ¼ 15 mm) every
day for 5 days. Typically, every day, the food patch covered by
the slime mould after crossing the bridge was transferred to a
new arena together with a new bridge and a new food patch,
and so on. Every daily transfers were done at the same time of
the day. In Q and CAF treatment, we followed the same pro-
cedure; except that slime moulds were required to cross an
agar bridge (1% agar) containing quinine (4 mM) or caffeine
(1 mM) to reach the food patch every day for 5 days. Accord-
ingly, the Q and CAF slime moulds were in contact with
quinine or caffeine once a day while crossing the bridge. We
chose a quinine concentration of 4 mM as, when encountering
such a concentration, slime moulds typically stop moving for
several hours before migrating through this repellent region.
Higher quinine concentrations would induce the slime mould
to turn back [21]. Caffeine was used as an alternative bitter repel-
lent. As caffeine, contrary to quinine, has never been tested
before in a comparable chemotaxis experiment, we had to test
various concentrations (1, 2, 3 and 4 mM). Slime moulds would
only cross the bridge if the concentrations were less than
2 mM. High concentrations of caffeine could turn out to be harm-
ful for slime moulds causing extrusions of cytoplasm at
concentrations 5–15 mM [22,23].
(ii) Test phase 1
On the sixth day, we tested the slime moulds for habituation and
stimulus generalization abilities. Q, CAF and half of the C slime
moulds (n ¼ 100) were offered a bridge containing either quinine
or caffeine, whereas the other half of the C slime moulds (n ¼
100) were once more offered a plain agar bridge. First, by offering
the same repellent for the sixth time to Q and CAF slime moulds,
we determined if there was a difference in responsiveness
between habituated slime moulds (Q or CAF) and unhabituated
ones (C). Second, by offering another repellent on day 6 to Q and
CAF slime moulds, we tested whether the slime moulds recov-
ered an aversive response that would show stimulus specificity
and rule out any form of sensory adaptation or motor fatigue.
(iii) Recovery phase
In the third phase of the experiment, the recovery phase, Q, CAF
and C slime moulds were all required to cross a plain agar bridge
to reach the food once a day for 2 days.
(iv) Test phase 2
On the ninth day, we tested the slime moulds for recovery. Q,
CAF and half of the C slime moulds were offered a bridge con-
taining quinine or caffeine, whereas the other half of the C
slime moulds were once again offered a plain agar bridge.
(c) Response variables
First, we recorded the time needed for each individual to make
the first contact with the bridge and to cross the bridge (i.e. to
make the first contact with the new food patch). Second, we
measured the area (pseudopod size) and the perimeter of the
pseudopod just as it contacted the food patch. We quantified
the pseudopod shape using a circularity index (circularity ¼
4p  area/perimeter2). High values of time to contact the
bridge and time to cross the bridge as well as low values of pseu-
dopod size and pseudopod shape would indicate that the slime
mould is avoiding contact with the bridge surface by extending a
slow and elongated pseudopod. All this variables were recorded
every day for each individual.

(d) Experimental procedure
We used different temperature-controlled chambers set to 258C.
In each chamber, a high definition camera (EOS 60D, Canonw)
took a picture every 5 min of the set-ups. All pictures were ana-
lysed using IMAGEJ software. Statistical analyses were performed
using IBMw SPSSw software (22.0). All statistical analyses are
presented in the electronic supplementary material.
3. Results
The behavioural variables measured throughout the whole
experiment are presented in figure 1 (time to contact the
bridge), figure 2 (time to cross the bridge), figure 3 (pseudo-
pod shape) and figure 4 (pseudopod size). The results are
also illustrated with a detailed example comparing the C
and Q slime moulds in figure 5.
(a) Habituation phase
On day 1, C slime moulds encountering agar entered the bridge
after an hour, spread widely and crossed the bridge rapidly in
about an hour (figures 1–4). In contrast, slime moulds encoun-
tering quinine (Q) or caffeine (CAF) for the first time showed a
clear aversive behaviour. Q slime moulds entered the bridge
only after 2.5 h and it took them 4 h to cross the bridge by
way of a very narrow pseudopod (figures 1–4 and electronic
supplementary material, table S1). CAF slime moulds were
the longest to enter the bridge (almost 5 h) and also built
thin pseudopods (figures 1–4 and electronic supplementary
material, table S1). However, contrary to Q slime moulds,
they crossed the bridge as quickly as a slime mould crossing
an agar bridge (figure 2 and electronic supplementary material,
table S1).
The following days of the habituation phase, Q and CAF
slime moulds started to contact the bridge sooner and sooner

and to form larger and larger pseudopods (figures 1–4 and
electronic
supplementary
material,
table
S2).
Q
slime
moulds also crossed the bridge twice as fast (figure 2 and
electronic supplementary material, table S2). For both CAF
and Q slime moulds, the decrease in responsiveness is
shown as an exponential function of the number of repellent
presentations (figures 1–4 and electronic supplementary
material, table S3 and figure S1). In contrast, the behaviour
of the C slime moulds encountering agar day after day
remained unchanged except for a slight decrease in the
time to contact the bridge (figures 1–4 and electronic
supplementary material, table S3).
(b) Test phase 1
The Q and CAF slime moulds crossing a bridge containing
quinine or caffeine for the sixth time showed reduced
aversive behaviour. They behaved like the C slime moulds
offered a plain agar bridge for 6 days in terms of shape
and pseudopods size (figures 3 and 4; electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S4). However, Q slime moulds remained
somewhat slower than the C slime moulds (figure 2 and elec-
tronic supplementary material, table S4) and CAF slime
moulds still entered the bridge later than the C slime
moulds (figure 1 and electronic supplementary material,
table S4). These results indicate that the CAF and Q slime
moulds habituated to their repellent, but still exhibited the
main trait of their aversive behaviour, respectively time to
contact the bridge and time to cross it, though in a diminished
way. In addition, Q and CAF slime moulds offered the same
repellent for 6 days behaved very differently from the C
slime moulds, which were offered the repellents for the first
time and showed aversive behaviour (figures 1–4 and
electronic supplementary material, table S5), confirming

habituation. In contrast, Q and CAF slime moulds facing a
different repellent from the one they habitually encountered
behaved like the C slime moulds facing the repellents for the
first time. They showed a strong aversive behaviour, avoiding
contact with the bridge and building slow and narrow pseudo-
pods (figures 1–4 and electronic supplementary material, table
S5). The results indicate that the response decrement shows
some stimulus specificity, ruling out motor or sensory fatigue.
(c) Recovery phase
All slime moulds behaved almost similarly, crossing the agar
bridge quickly with large pseudopods throughout the recovery
phase (figures 1–4 and electronic supplementary material,
table S6). Only, CAF slime moulds took longer to enter the
bridge on the first day of the recovery phase, but this difference
vanished the second day of the recovery phase (figure 1 and
electronic supplementary material, table S6).
(d) Test phase 2
Contrary to what we observed during test 1, after recovery, Q
and CAF slime moulds encountering their respective repel-
lent behaved differently to C slime moulds encountering
agar in terms of pseudopod shape and size (electronic
supplementary material, table S7).
Q and C slime moulds encountering quinine or caffeine
showed a similar aversive behaviour, i.e. narrowand slow pseu-
dopods (electronic supplementary material, table S8 and
figures 1–4). The behavioural response of the Q slime moulds
to quinine after recovery was similar to their behaviour when
they encountered the quinine for the first time on day 1 indicat-
ing that Q slime moulds had recovered from the habituation
phase (electronic supplementary material, table S9).
CAF and C slime moulds also showed a similar aversive be-
haviour towards quinine (electronic supplementary material,
table S8 and figures 1–4). However, when facing caffeine,
CAF and C slime moulds behaved differently regarding the
time to enter the bridge, which is the strongest manifestation
of aversive behaviour towards caffeine (electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S8). CAF slime moulds facing caffeine
entered the bridge quicker than the C slime moulds and also
quicker than when they faced caffeine for the first time
on day 1 (figure 1 and electronic supplementary material,
table S9). This indicates that the CAF slime moulds did not
recover completely after 2 days.
4. Discussion
In this paper, we demonstrate that a single-celled organism
fulfilled the two major criteria of habituation learning.
P. polycephalum learns to ignore a stimulus when the stimulus
is repeated and spontaneously recovers when it is withheld
for 2 days. Moreover, we were able to show stimulus speci-
ficity:
the
aversive
response
still
occurred
to
another
stimulus. This characteristic can be used to distinguish habitu-
ation from more general sensory adaptation or motor fatigue
[17]. As stimulus generalization within the same sensory
modality could not be shown, this suggests that habituation
does not happen at a central level, rather at the level of primary
sensors [17].
While the specific mechanisms of quinine and caffeine
chemoreception in P. polycephalum are still unknown, the pro-
cess is likely similar to that of chemoreception across other
single-celled organisms [24–27]. Quinine and caffeine likely
bind to chemoreceptors on the cell membrane, which in
turn trigger a signalling cascade that leads to a new migration
direction [28]. While high levels of such stimulants could
cause such a severe reaction that the organism changes its
direction of migration, here, we chose sufficiently low con-
centrations of repellent to enable the plasmodium to cross
the bridge while not harming it [21,23]. In our experiment,
quinine and caffeine affects slime mould motile behaviour,
causing a significant reduction in velocity and spreading.
We show that when exposed to quinine and caffeine on
several successive days, this aversive response progressively
decreased. As indicated by Ginsburg & Jablonka [3], new
insights into the evolution of eukaryotic signal transduction
and gene regulation offer a theoretical framework for under-
standing learning in single-celled organisms. Epigenetic
regulatory mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone
modifications or changes in transcription factors encode past

experiences of a single cell, and are often considered one of the
most fundamental types of memory. Such mechanisms can
strengthen adaptive response patterns that depend on prior
exposure to various stimuli in a single cell [3]. Thus, we can
imagine that the signalling pathway behind quinine and
caffeine chemoreception may lead to transient inhibitory
epigenetic markings that reduce the level of expression of key
receptor genes [3]. After each stimulation, the number of
quinine and caffeine receptors would decrease eventually
leading to a lack of aversive response to the repellent. We can
also imagine that the three-dimensional conformation of
the chemoreceptors may experience small, semi-persistent
modifications after each stimulation, which may raise their
activation threshold, leading to a decrease in the aversive
response of the organism following several exposures to
quinine and caffeine [3].
Many of the processes we might consider fundamental fea-
tures of the brain, such as sensory integration, decision-making
and now, learning, have all been displayed in these non-neural
organisms. The survival of slime moulds depends on their
ability to respond and adapt to changing environmental con-
ditions. In all organisms, habituation allows animals to
ignore irrelevant stimuli and focus selectively on important
stimuli that are key to their survival. Stimulus specificity, as
we showed in this study, seems relevant to the evolution of
habituation. Habituation reduces the response to innocuous
stimuli while still enabling the organism to respond to novel
and potentially harmful stimuli that would fall in the same
sensory modality. Challenges for the future include the eluci-
dation of how slime moulds integrate environmental cues in
order to produce an adapted response. Whether capacities
for simple learning in slime moulds extend beyond habituation
and constitute a prerequisite for other forms of learning such as
associative learning remains an open question. Previous
attempts at showing associative learning processes in slime
moulds had significant shortcomings [29]. In living organisms
with nervous systems, behavioural habituation is the result of
an alteration in neurons and synapses [16]. Slime moulds
clearly have no neurons making them an excellent model in
which to understand and elucidate the molecular components
of cell-mediated habituation and learning.
