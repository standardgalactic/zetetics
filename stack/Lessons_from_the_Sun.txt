In this brief note, the implications of a condensed Sun will be examined. A celestial
body composed of liquid metallic hydrogen brings great promise to astronomy, relative
to understanding thermal emission and solar structure. At the same time, as an incom-
pressible liquid, a condensed Sun calls into question virtually everything which is cur-
rently believed with respect to the evolution and nature of the stars. Should the Sun be
condensed, then neutron stars and white dwarfs will fail to reach the enormous densities
they are currently believed to possess. Much of cosmology also falls into question, as
the incompressibility of matter curtails any thought that a primordial atom once existed.
Aging stars can no longer collapse and black holes will know no formative mechanism.
A condensed Sun also hints that great strides must still be made in understanding the
nature of liquids. The Sun has revealed that liquids possess a much greater potential for
lattice order than previously believed. In addition, lessons may be gained with regards
to the synthesis of liquid metallic hydrogen and the use of condensed matter as the basis
for initiating fusion on Earth.
“Young people, especially young women, often ask me
for advice. Here it is, valeat quantum. Do not under-
take a scientiﬁc career in quest of fame or money. There
are easier and better ways to reach them. Undertake it
only if nothing else will satisfy you; for nothing else is
probably what you will receive. Your reward will be
the widening of the horizon as you climb. And if you
achieve that reward you will ask no other.”
Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin [1]
When Cecilia Payne [1] discovered that the stars are primarily
composed of hydrogen [2], she encountered strong opposi-
tion from Arthur Eddington, her ﬁrst mentor, and from Henry
Norris Russell [3]. Nonetheless, Cecilia Payne’s work engen-
dered a new age in astronomy: hydrogen became the build-
ing block of the universe. Russell would eventually come to
echo Payne’s position [4]. In those days, it was natural to
assume that a hydrogen-based Sun would be gaseous [5, 6].
Ten years after Payne published her classic report, Wigner
and Huntington proposed that condensed metallic hydrogen
could be synthesized [7]. In so doing, they unknowingly pro-
vided James Jeans with the material he had lacked in con-
structing liquid stars [5]. Still, though liquid metallic hydro-
gen became a component of the giant planets and the white
dwarf [8], the concept of condensed matter was kept well re-
moved from the Sun.
Now that liquid metallic hydrogen has been advanced as a
solar building block (see [8] and citations therein), it is likely
that opposition will be raised, for many will foresee unset-
tling changes in astronomy. A liquid Sun brings into ques-
tion our understanding of nearly every facet of this science:
from stellar structure and evolution [9], the existence of black
holes [10], the premordial atom [11], dark energy [12], and
dark matter [13]. It is not easy to abandon familiar ideas and
begin anew.
However, some scientists will realize that a liquid metallic
hydrogen model of the Sun [8], not only opens new avenues,
but it also uniﬁes much of human knowledge into a cohesive
and elegant framework. A liquid metallic Sun invites astron-
omy to revisit the days of Kirchhoﬀ[14] and Stewart [15], and
to recall the powerful lessons learned from studying the ther-
mal emission of materials [16,17]. It emphasizes that our tele-
scopes observe structural realities and not illusions [18, 19].
In recognizing the full character of these structures, all of the
great solar astronomers from Galileo [20], to Secchi [21], to
Hale [22] are honored. These observers knew that solar struc-
tures (granules, sunspots, pores, ﬂares, prominences, etc.. . )
were manifesting something profound about nature.
For astrophysicists, the Sun imparts lessons which may
well have direct applications for mankind. For instance, the
solar body holds the key to fusion. If the Sun is made from
condensed matter [8], then our experiments should focus on
this state. Sunspots may also guard the secret to synthesizing
metallic hydrogen on Earth [8]. If sunspots are truly metal-
lic [18], as reﬂected by their magnetic ﬁelds [22], then at-
tempts to form liquid metallic hydrogen on Earth [8] might
beneﬁt from the presence of magnetic ﬁelds. Our analysis
of the photospheric constitution and the continuous thermal
spectrum should be trying to tell us something about liquids
and their long range order. It is currently believed that liq-
uids possess only short term order [23]. In this regard, per-
haps physics has lacked caution in bombarding the fragile liq-
uid lattice with X-rays and neutrons [24,25]. These methods
may fail to properly sample the underlying structure. Gentler

approaches may reveal structure where none was previously
believed to exist. The solar spectrum implies long range or-
der, much like that observed in graphite [16,17,26]. As such,
liquid metallic hydrogen on the photosphere could provide
the framework for long range order, despite the fact that its
only binding force lies in the need to maintain electronic con-
duction bands (see [8] and references therein). Most impor-
tantly, however, the Sun might be trying to tell us that we still
do not properly understand thermal emission [16, 17, 27]. If
gaseous models exist to this day, it is because the mechanism
which produces the blackbody spectrum in graphite contin-
ues to be elusive [16,17,27]. Of all spectroscopic signatures,
blackbody radiation remains the only one which has not been
explained fully. These problems constitute serious and im-
portant questions for humanity. Unlocking these mysteries is
certain to keep scientists occupied, as we continue to ponder
upon the lessons discerned from the Sun.
