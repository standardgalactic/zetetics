GENERAL
The roof trusses you are about to install have been manufactured to 
engineering standards. To ensure that the trusses perform as designed 
it is essential that they be handled, erected and braced correctly.  
The installation of prefabricated timber trusses is covered by the Australian 
Standard AS 4440 “Installation of NailPlated Timber Trusses”. The following 
information is an abbreviated set of instructions designed to assist 
with on site work and is not intended to replace the need to reference  
AS 4440. The following recommendations apply to roof trusses on standard 
domestic buildings where truss design details are obtained from MiTek 
engineering programs. Details for commercial, industrial and non standard 
domestic buildings, are to be provided by an Engineer responsible for the 
overall building design.
DESIGN
1.	Trusses are designed for normal roof, ceiling and wind loads to suit specific 
jobs and conditions. Additional loading such as Solar Units, Hot Water 
Tanks, Air Conditioning, etc. require special consideration. Advice should 
be sought from the truss fabricator prior to commencing construction.
2.	Wall frames and beams supporting trusses must be designed for the correct 
roof loads. Refer AS 1684 “Residential Timber-Framed Construction”  
for details.
3.	Wind load is an important factor in the design and performance of roof 
trusses. Ensure that you have correctly advised the truss fabricator with 
regard to wind load requirements and that adequate provision has been 
made to fix trusses to the support structure to withstand wind uplift forces.
4.	Trusses are generally designed to be supported on the outer wall with inner 
walls being non load bearing. Where it is necessary to use internal walls 
for load bearing, these will be clearly shown on layouts. Note that the 
supporting structure is stable in its own right.
5.	Before ordering trusses, ensure that your particular requirements have 
been provided for and that all relevant information has been supplied to 
the truss manufacturer. If non standard trusses are being used, ensure 
that erection and bracing details are known before erection commences.
6.	For environments where the atmosphere may be conducive to corrosion, 
such as some types of industrial and agricultural buildings, or buildings 
near the ocean and subject to salt spray, consideration should be given to 
the use of G8S stainless steel connector plates.
Important Note
1.	It is the Builder’s responsibility to ensure that all relevant information 
required for design is provided to the fabricator at time of ordering 
trusses, including spans, pitches, profiles, quantities and loadings.  
Final confirmation of details by the fabricator with the builder is 
recommended prior to manufacture.
2.	Trusses are designed to be part of a structural system, which includes 
battens/purlins, bracing, binders, fascias and the connection of these 
components. The full strength of trusses is not achieved until all 
components are installed correctly. All trusses must braced (temporary 
and permanently) and stabilised throughout installation of the roof truss 
system. No truss should be loaded until all permanent bracing is fixed 
and battens/purlins are installed. Installers should not stand on any truss 
until all temporary bracing is fixed in place and the truss is stabilised in 
accordance with the following instructions.
3.	A risk assessment shall be undertaken for each site taking into account  
all relevant workplace safety  practices, including working height. It is the 
builders responsibility to consider the site conditions when determining 
procedures for handling, lifting, fixing and bracing of roof components. 
The procedures shall be discussed with all employees and sub contractors 
working on site and the agreed methods documented. A useful template 
for this purpose is the “Safe Working Method Statement No. 10” which 
is published by the Housing Industry Association (HIA) and available on 
their website. “The National Code of Practice for the Prevention of Falls in 
Housing Construction” produced by Safe Work Australia contains specific  
information and guidance on risk management for working at height 
in the residential construction sector. All safety gear appropriate to the 
site and work being carried out shall be worn, including eye protection,  
foot protection and gloves when handling sharp edges.
4.	Ensure all bracing is permanently fixed and all brackets are fully installed 
prior to working on or loading the roof.
5.	Trusses are designed for specific loading, geometry and support conditions. 
Under no circumstances should any component of the truss be drilled, cut, 
removed or modified in any way without prior approval from the truss 
fabricator.
6.	Trusses should not be used or stored where they are subjected to repeated 
wetting and drying as this has a detrimental effect on the strength of both 
timber and connections.
7.	If trusses have been designed for timber fascias, do not replace with steel 
fascia without asking your truss supplier to check the overhang design.
TRANSPORT
Trusses must be fully supported when being transported in either a horizontal 
or vertical plane. Care must be taken when tying down, not to put strain on 
chords or webs.
Timber or metal right angle protectors are a satisfactory method of avoiding 
damage. Unloading and handling is described opposite.
JOB STORAGE AND LIFTING
Trusses should be inspected on arrival at site. Any damaged trusses  
should be reported immediately and not site repaired without approval of  
the truss fabricator.
Where it is anticipated that trusses will be stored on site for an extended 
period of time before use, adequate provision should be made to protect 
trusses against the effects of weather.
Once trusses are installed they should not be left exposed to weather for long 
periods. Repeated wetting and drying has a detrimental effect on the strength 
of both timber and connection.
Protective covering, where used, should allow free air circulation around trusses.
Trusses when stored on the job site should be on timber fillets clear off the 
ground and in a flat position to avoid distortion.
When lifting, care must be taken to avoid damaging of joints and timber. 
Spreader bars with attachment to the panel points should be used where 
span exceeds 9000 mm. Never lift by the apex joint only.
The trusses may also be placed on the top plates by pulling them up on skids, 
spread at 3000 mm, taking the same precaution as described above.
Ensure that the trusses are not distorted or allowed to sag between supports.
The recommended method of lifting trusses will depend on a number of factors, 
including truss length and shape.
In general, sling truss from top chord panel points as shown below.  
Slings should be located at equal distance from truss centreline and be 
approximately 1/3 to 1/2 truss length apart.
The angle between sling legs should be 60° or less and where truss spans 
are greater than 9000 mm a spreader bar or StrongBack should be used.  
Some typical examples are shown below.

Where a gable end is required, consult your truss fabricator for details of 
construction and erection.
Supporting Structure (Frame or Brick)
A structure that is not level and is out of square will result in an ugly and 
unsatisfactory roof line. Time is well spent in ensuring:
1.	The load bearing top plates are level.
2.	The structure is of the correct dimension.
3.	The top plates as well as being level, are straight in their length .
4.	The internal walls are set below the outer wall level by:  
Unbattened ceiling – 10mm. Battened ceiling – 10mm plus  
batten thickness.
NOTE: For 900mm spaced trusses, plasterers prefer to use 50mm battens.
Wall Frame Construction
The load bearing frames should be checked for:
1.	Lintel sizes suitable for truss loading. Consult AS 1684 or your truss 
fabricator.
2.	If trusses are not located directly over studs the top plate size must be in 
accordance with AS 1684.
3.	Girder trusses may require the strengthening of studs at the points of 
support. Check the loading with your truss fabricator and refer to AS 1684. 
Points circled on the layout notes are critical.
	
The supporting structure construction must be adequate to resist wind 
up-lift forces.

Frame Bracing
The frame must be fully braced, plumb, and nailed home before the erection 
of trusses is commenced.
ERECTION AND FIXING
It is convenient to mark the truss position on the wall plates before lifting 
trusses. Use the layout drawing as your guide and note that the truss design 
spacing must not be exceeded.
Ensure first truss is installed carefully and within erection tolerances. 
WARNING – Do not use web as ladder to climb up or down the roof during 
installation. This can cause damage to the web and lead to serious injury. 
GABLE ROOFS – start with a gable truss at each end, fixing it to the top plate 
at the position marked. These trusses must be temporarily braced back to the 
ground or frame at the panel points.
HIP OR DUTCH GABLE – start with the Dutch girder truss or the truncated 
girder, placing it on the top plate at the position marked and temporarily 
bracing it back to the frame. Locate hip and jack trusses and adjust girder 
truss position before fixing.
LINE – Using a stringline along the Apex, place each intermediate truss  
and fix it to the top plate at the position marked, spacing it with gauging  
rods and ties.

Camber
Trusses are built with a camber in the bottom chord. The camber is designed 
to suit the span and load. A girder truss will have more camber than other 
trusses. The camber is progressively taken up as the load from the roof 
covering and ceiling is applied. Under no circumstances should trusses be 
supported along the span (unless designed for) by blocking or propping.
If a truss has been designed to be supported internally a “SUPPORT HERE” 
label is affixed to the appropriate point.
Camber
Erection Bracing
THE TRUSSES MUST BE BRACED DURING ERECTION.  
IF THIS IS NOT DONE, THEN TWO PROBLEMS CAN OCCUR.
1.	Collapse during erection.
2.	Erection tolerance will be exceeded, causing overloading, buckling and 
possible permanent damage.
The exact details of erection bracing will, for practical purposes, differ from 
job to job. The following recommendations are for guidance only as the 
details employed are the erectors responsibility.
The first truss should be erected straight and plumb to erection tolerances 
given previously and temporarily braced to a rigid element, e.g. wall or 
ground as shown on diagram following.

Tie
Each successive truss should be spaced using TrussSpacers. TrussSpacers 
are recommended in lieu of gauging rod or timber ties, as these can be fixed 
to the trusses prior to lifting trusses on to top plates.
If timber ties are used, they must be continuous and be no less than 70 x 35 
F5. Fix to each truss with a minimum of one 65mm nail and splice the ends 
by lapping over two adjacent trusses. Short timber noggings between trusses 
are not acceptable.
DO NOT STAND ON A TRUSS THAT DOES NOT HAVE ALL ITS 
TRUSSSPACERS OR TEMPORARY TIES FIXED.
The purpose of temporary bracing is to hold trusses straight and plumb prior 
to fixing permanent bracing. All permanent bracing, ties, hold down, etc. 
must be fixed prior to loading roof.
CODE REQUIREMENTS - Australian Standard for the installation of nailplated 
trusses AS 4440 requires that temporary ties are to be used on top chords 
at spacings no greater than 3000mm and on bottom chords at spacings no 
greater then 4000mm. However, it is good practice to place top chord ties at 
each top chord panel point. 
The TrussSpacer is designed to replace the temporary chord ties as required 
by AS 4440. To conform with AS 4440 requirements use TrussSpacers  
as below.

IMPORTANT NOTE
These recommendations are a guide only for the erection of standard gable 
trusses up to 13000mm span, and spaced at centres not exceeding 1200mm. 
For trusses beyond these conditions, consult your truss fabricator.
Erection Tolerances
Tolerance is critical for both a good roof line and effective bracing. A stringline, 
a plumb line or level should be used.
1.	Trusses to be erected with minimal bow, in the truss and in any chord, with 
a tolerance not exceeding the lesser of L/200 and 50mm, where L is as 
defined as shown in diagrams.
2.	Trusses to be erected so that no part of the truss is out of plumb with a 
tolerance exceeding the lesser of height/50 and 50 mm.
Generally if a bow or tilt is evident to the eye, the truss has been erected 
outside the tolerances.

INTERNAL OR NON-LOAD BEARING WALLS.
(a) Non-Bracing Wall
If internal or non-load bearing walls are not designed as bracing walls,  
fix the truss with the InternalWall Bracket with nails to middle of slots to 
allow for truss settlement as it is loaded. Brackets are fixed at 1.8m centres 
along unsupported sections of the wall. Where trusses are parallel to walls, 
trim between the bottom chords and fix brackets to the trimmer. Where non-
load-bearing walls are stable in their own right, no InternalWall Brackets  
are required.

FIXING TO GIRDER TRUSSES
Special Girder Brackets are available for supporting standard trusses on 
the bottom chords of Girder Trusses. These brackets should be fully fixed 
in accordance with details supplied by the truss fabricator prior to loading 
roof. (Refer page 20).

Connection of valley (saddle) trusses to be in accordance with details 
supplied by the truss fabricator or those in AS 4440.
FIXING OF MULTIPLE PLY TRUSSES
Multiple ply trusses are required to be joined in accordance with the following 
recommendations to comply with design assumptions.
STANDARD, TRUNCATED AND HIP TRUSSES
Double Truss (nail one side only)
Join all chords and webs with nails or screws staggered one side only.  
*Nails or screws to be at 300mm centres for top chords and 450mm centres 
for bottom chord and webs.
300mm (T/c)
450mm (B/c, web)
TRIPLE TRUSS 
(nail both sides with bolts or screws at panel points)
Join outer trusses to centre truss using the double truss details. In addition, 
join trusses at each panel point with one M12 bolt or alternatively with two 
sufficiently long No. 14 screws from each side (i.e. 4 screws at each panel 
point).
M12 bolt at
panel points 
GIRDER AND DUTCH HIP GIRDER TRUSSES
Nail or screw as for standard trusses except maximum nail or screw centres 
to be 300mm to all chords and webs. 
Waling plate to be fixed to each Dutch Hip girder chord and web crossing with 
nails, screws or bolts in accordance with M2RS-0008.
If screws are used in FastFit MkIII and MKIV Girder Bracket, use 65mm screws 
in double 35mm girder. With triple 35mm ply girder, use 65mm screws 
in bracket and fix additional 65mm screws in back of girder truss behind 
bracket. Use 3 screws for FastFit MKIII and 8 screws for FastFit MKIV Girder 
Bracket. Alternatively, use 100mm No. 14 Type 17 hex head screws in bracket.  
With multiple 50mm ply girder, use bolts or longer screws.
NAILING DETAILS (all truss types)
NAILS - Use 3.05mm diameter glue coated or ring shank nails, minimum 
65mm long for truss thickness up to 38mm or 75mm long for truss thickness 
up to 50mm
BOLTS - Use M12 bolts with 50 x 50 x 3.0mm square washers or 55 dia. x 3.0mm 
round washers.
SCREWS - Use No. 14 gauge x 65mm long up to 38mm timber or 75mm long 
up to 50mm timber.
For further information refer to MIRS-0020. 
*Ensure all fasteners are fixed before loading roof.
GABLE END FIXING
There are a number of different ways in which gable ends and verge overhangs 
can be constructed. These include:
• 	 Cantilevered Battens
• 	 Underpurlines
• 	 Outriggers over Raking Truss
• 	 Verge Sprockets
The selection of a particular method will depend on a number of factors 
including verge overhang distance, roof and ceiling material, truss spacing, 
end wall construction, wind load and preferred local building practice and 
cost. The following are typical details for each fixing method. For connection 
details refer to MIRS-0016

Hip End Fixing
The fixing details in this section are suitable for trusses with maximum 
spacing up to 900mm (or 1200mm for sheet roof up to N3), snow 
load up to 0.2kPa and 3600mm maximum truncated girder station.  
For other applications exceeding these limits, refer to connections detailed in 
the MiTek 20/20 design output.
NOTES:
1.	These connections are adequate, based on general domestic construction 
practices which include at least two 2.5mm skew nails, with a penetration 
of 10 times of nail diameter to supporting member, connecting each 
member.
2.	Nails details may be substituted by screws with equivalent capacity.
3.	These details are also applicable for use in conjunction with conventional 
hip ends.
For Wind Classification N1, N2, N3 or C1
Connection of trusses at hip end for wind classification N1, N2, N3 or C1 are 
in accordance with the details shown and described in Figure 1 and Detail

ROOFING BATTENS 
The stability of any roof system is reliant on the tile or sheeting battens.  
The contract with the roofer should include the following provisions:
Roofing battens should be fixed securely to all truss top chords in accordance 
with AS 1684 unless otherwise specified by local building regulations.  
For multiple ply trusses, battens should be fixed securely to each ply of truss 
top chord with at least one nail or other mechanical fixing. Battens wider than 
50mm should be secured with two fixings to each ply.
Battens to be arranged so that on any truss top chord, not more than 1 in 3 
battens are spliced and no two splices are adjacent.
In the areas of roof not bounded on both sides by diagonal bracing, battens 
should be continuous, if not use “Batten Strapnails” to splice. 
Roof should not be loaded until all roofing battens are securely fixed. 
WARNING: Some types of steel tile battens do not provide adequate 
lateral restraint to truss top chords. Before using steel tile battens obtain 
certification from your steel batten supplier confirming that their product 
will provide at least the same lateral restraint as timber battens.
Roof truss

Note: Batten splices. 
No two splices are to be

Note: Batten splices.
Not more than 1 in 3 battens are

2.	Maximum batten spacing = 1200mm
3.	Batten size and grade to be in accordance with AS 1684 span tables.
Batten splices should be typically located away from girder trusses.  
Use detail with stiffener as shown in Option 4.

PERMANENT BRACING 
Before loading, roof trusses must be permanently braced back to the rigid 
building element, such as support walls, to prevent rotation or buckling of 
trusses under the weight of roof and ceiling material or under wind uplift.
These recommendations provide for:
a)	Wind Classifications for areas up to C3.
b)	Walls being stable and braced in their own right.
c)	Roof spans up to 16000 mm.
d)	Maximum truss centres:
	
(i) 900 mm in Wind Classification areas up to C3.
	
(ii) 1200 mm for sheet roofs in Wind Classification areas up toN3. 
e)	Maximum roof pitch of 45°.
For conditions beyond these, consult your truss manufacturer.

SpeedBrace 
SpeedBrace is a bracing system for the bracing of trussed roofs in both low 
wind speed and cyclone areas.
SpeedBrace is manufactured in accordance to AS 4440 steelbrace specification.
SpeedBrace is a tension bracing system that uses a pre-punched shallow ‘V’ 
shaped member that is easily handled and erected. SpeedBrace is applied in 
an ‘X’ or ‘V’ pattern to the top of the chord and braces the trusses back to 
the frame.
SpeedBrace offers many advantages over other bracing systems.
•	 Applied to top of top chord – speed and simplicity.
•	 Pre-tension – no turnbuckles or similar device is required to tension the 
brace.
•	 Maximum load is governed by end fixing and splicing which are to be 
made strictly in accordance with details shown in this publication.
•	 Pre-punched – nailing made quick and easy with special MiTek 30 x 2.8 
galvanized reinforced head nails.
•	 Uniform strength – assured performance.
•	 Side by side splicing for easy layout and fixing.
•	 Positive end fixing – wrap around at apex, splice and frame.
(Clouts should not be used in fixing SpeedBrace.)

Bottom Chord Bracing 
When plasterboard ceilings are fixed direct to the bottom chords of trusses 
or via battens in accordance with AS 1684, the horizontal wind load on the 
roof and walls of a house is normally transferred to the bracing walls through 
the diaphragm action of the plasterboard ceiling. This structural ceiling 
diaphragm also provides lateral restraint to the truss bottom chords of the 
trusses.
If there is no ceiling attached to the bottom chord, or if the ceiling is 
suspended or fixed using furring channels that are clipped to the bottom 
chord, then an alternative bottom chord bracing system is required to provide 
truss stability and building stability.
Where plasterboard is not fixed direct or via battens then:
1.	Truss stability is achieved by using bottom chord binders and diagonal 
bracing on the bottom chord similar to roof bracing. The bottom chord 
binders should be spaced in accordance with the truss design. The ends 
of both bottom chord binders and diagonal bracing are to be anchored to 
a rigid building element.
2.	A structural engineer should be consulted for specific design of a bottom 
chord bracing system which is suitable for the particular requirements of 
the building.

The bracing layout is related to the span and shape of the roof.

ROOF SPANS LESS THAN 8000 MM
The forces in a roof of less than 8000 mm span are relatively low and may be 
restrained by the use of a single SpeedBrace in a “V” configuration. The angle 
of SpeedBrace to wall frame should be between 30° and 45°, and each truss 
should be crossed with a least two braces.
For roof lengths less than half span (h) use detail for Very Short Roofs below.

Typical Bracing Layouts 
GABLE ROOF
Select a roof layout such that the angle between the ridge line and the brace is 
between 30° and 45°. There are eight basic bracing arrangements to consider 
depending on truss span and building length as given above. Bracing bays 
should extend from end trusses on the building.
HIP ROOF
For roofs on buildings of rectangular plan with trussed hip ends or dutch 
hip ends, bracing is required between apex of hip ends only. In such 
cases the roof length “L” is taken as being the distance between the two 
intersections of hip and ridgeline at each end of the building. One of the 
recommended bracing layouts for gable roof then can be applied as 
shown in (a) for roof length “L” ≥ half span “h” of the roof truss, except 
where roof length “L” of standard truss is less than the half span “h” of 
the roof truss, in which case bracing should be arranged as shown in (b).

On dual pitched roofs and cut-off roofs where the ridge line is not central 
on the building it may be necessary to determine bracing layout from a 
combination of 1, 2, 3 and 4 above. In such cases each side of the ridge shall 
be considered as a separate case.

SKILLION
Where the roof consists of half trusses, the span of the half truss should be 
taken as the half span “h” when using the above recommendations, and the 
apex braced to supporting structure. See section on Treatment of Internal 
Supports etc.
NOTE:
The previous are typical layouts for bracing. However, for special 
circumstances, e.g. small spans and complex roof shapes, bracing layout 
will be supplied.
SpeedBrace Fixing Details 
1.	Always use MiTek 30mm x 2.8mm dia. Galvanized Reinforced Head Nails 
when fixing SpeedBrace.
2.	At each truss, fix SpeedBrace to the top of the top chord with two nails. 
Select nail holes most central to the timber edge. Flatten bracing while 
nailing to avoid interference with battens.
3.	At end truss fix off the SpeedBrace as shown. A pair of tinsnips will cut 
the brace. After fixing to top of top chord use your hammer to form a tight 
bend and fix to face of top chord with three nails.

5.	At the heel, SpeedBrace should be fixed in one of the following ways:­  
The simplest method, where roof geometry permits is to fix directly to the 
wall top plate as shown below. The brace must be kept straight between 
the last braced truss and wall top plate. Also the angle between the brace 
and the wall top plate must not exceed 45°, i.e. 1:1 slope.

CAUTION
The SpeedBrace must be positively fixed to the top plate otherwise the 
bracing will be ineffective.
An alternative method can be used where it is desired to extend the brace to 
the last truss or where the angles do not permit ready fixing to the top plate. 
The last two trusses should be fixed to the wall top plate with a minimum of 
two Trip-L-Grips to each truss, and timber block between trusses as shown.

WEB TIES & STIFFENERS
Some truss designs require longitudinal ties, stiffeners or other supplementary 
members to be applied to webs. Where longitudinal ties are used, they should 
be 70 x 35 (F5) or as specified by the truss fabricator. Where longitudinal 
ties are used, they should be continuous and fixed to web of each truss at 
mid-height with 2 x 3.75 dia. nails and braced back to truss with one bay of 
crossed SpeedBrace at each end and intermediate bay at 10m centres fixed 
as shown below. Ties may be spliced by lapping over 2 adjacent trusses.
Web stiffeners may be specified in lieu of web ties where it is difficult to fit 
web ties because of the small number of trusses or the varying position of the 
webs. eg. Truncated trusses and Hip trusses.
Web stiffeners may be timber sections fitted on-site or steel Eliminator 
stiffeners fixed during manufacture. Where timber stiffeners are used these 
should be the size and grade specified by the truss designer and should be 
continuous for the full length of the web. Timber stiffeners are to be fixed 
as below.

HOLD-DOWN DETAILS FOR TRUSSES  
Cyclonic & Non-Cyclonic
The following details should be used as a guide only as hold down 
requirements will vary depending on the type of supporting structure.  
The method of hold down is the responsibility of the builder.
For a more accurate assessment of hold down requirements on specific jobs, 
refer to truss design outputs.
When tie-downs are attached to frames incorporating single sided stud 
straps such as StudStrap and WallStrap, the tie-down bracket should connect 
to the same side of the frame as the strap.
Details for fixing wall plates to foundations are to be provided by others.  
The supporting structure must also be designed by others to resist all vertical 
and horizontal loadings.

BearingPlate (BP80)
The BearingPlate has been developed to improve the crushing resistance of 
wall plates under heavily loaded trusses. The positioning of a ConnectorPlate 
onto the bottom chord of the truss above the BearingPlate as shown in these 
specifications, will also improve the crushing resistance of the bottom chord 
to match the wall plate.
Fixing Instructions For BearingPlate:
Position the BearingPlate centrally along the top of the wall plate and 
such that it projects at least 20mm on either side of the supported truss.  
Fix with four 30 x 2.8mm MiTek Reinforced Head Nails. The bottom chord 
of the truss is to be reinforced with a ConnectorPlate located not more 
than 6mm above the BearingPlate, and projects at least 10mm beyond the 
BearingPlate, as illustrated.
In addition to the BearingPlate, a tie down connection is required to resist 
uplift. This connection should not be less than two Trip-L-Grips.

GIRDER BRACKETS
Girder Brackets have been developed to support standard trusses on the 
bottom chord of girder trusses or beams, and may also be used to connect 
beams to beams. The brackets have been designed and tested to ensure 
that the load of the standard truss is transferred to the girder truss or beam 
without inducing rotation in the supporting member.
Determination of Bracket Type
A range of Girder Brackets are available. The type of bracket required for your 
project will depend on the loads which it is required to carry. The selection 
of bracket type should be done in conjunction with your MiTek fabricator or 
a Structural Engineer.
FastFit MKIII Girder Bracket - Screws (GB340, GB350)
FastFit MKIII Girder Bracket can be installed with MiTek self tapping screws for 
speedy installation.
FastFit MKIII Girder Bracket - Bolts (GB340, GB350)

Hip Girder Bracket (HGB35)
A Hip Girder Bracket HGB35 can be installed on one or both sides of FastFit 
Girder Brackets GB340, GB440 and GB475 using screw holes which are 
aligned with the screw holes in the FastFit Girder Bracket.
General Fixing Instructions:
1.	Locate bracket on girder truss bottom chord and hold in position by 
nailing through locating holes. If bracket has anti-rotation tab, fix nails to 
underside of girder.
2.	If bolts are used to fix bracket, drill through 12mm pre-punched holes 
into girder. Fix bracket with bolts and washers. No additional fasteners are 
required for multiple ply girders beyond nominal fixing.
3.	If screws are used in FastFit MkIII and MkIV Girder Bracket, drive screws 
through 7mm pre-punched holes into girder. Use 30mm screws in single 
ply and 65mm screws in double 35mm ply girder. With triple 35mm ply 
girder, use 65mm screws in bracket and fix 3 additional 65mm screws in 
back of girder truss behind bracket. Alternatively, use 100mm No. 14 Type 
17 hex head screws in bracket. With multiple 50mm ply girder, use bolts 
or longer screws.
4.	Install supported truss on bracket and position it hard against girder.
5.	Fix supported truss to bracket according to diagram for type of Girder Bracket.
6.	All Fasteners (bolts, screws and nails) must be tightly secured before 
trusses are loaded.
Nominal Multiple Ply Truss Fixing:
Over and above the additional fixing for different Girder Brackets in multiple 
ply girders, the following nominal fixing must also be installed.
Double Truss 
Fasten all chords and webs together with 3.05 x 75mm glue coated or ring 
shank nails (at angle), or No. 14 x 65mm screws (35mm timber) or 75mm 
screws (50mm timber) at 300 centres, staggered on one side only.
Triple Truss 
Fasten each outer ply to middle ply using details for double truss. In addition, 
join trusses at each panel joint with one M12 bolt.
GENERAL NOTES
Apply to all Girder Bracket types:
1.	Holes to be drilled to suit M12 bolts. Do not drill oversized holes. Use 
hexagonal head bolts. DO NOT USE REDUCED SHANK OR CUP HEAD BOLTS.
2.	Use 50 x 50 x 3 mm square or 56 mm diameter x 3 mm round washer for 
M12 bolts.
3.	Nails, where specified, to be MiTek 30 x 2.8mm diameter hot dipped 
galvanised reinforced head nails.
4.	Minimum Girder Truss bottom chords apply to each type of Girder Bracket. 
Refer Installation Instruction drawings.
5.	Where ceiling is to be fixed directly to bottom chord, notching of the 
heel of supported trusses is recommended to obtain a better ceiling line,  
when using MkII and FastFit short tab Girder Brackets
6.	Screws, where specified, to be MiTek MSA1430 or MSA1465 anti-split 
self-drilling HD galvaized screws. DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN SCREWS.  
Use suitable power screw driver (not power drill) with torque clutch 
properly adjusted, or depth limiting driver.
7.	When driving screws into denser hardwood, screws should be driven in a 
single action. Do not partly drive screws and attempt to re-start. Remove 
partly driven screws and start process again.

Universal Girder Brackets
MidLoad (GBM) and HiLoad (GBH) Girder Brackets 
These Girder Brackets are manufactured with a long cleat to prevent twisting 
of the bottom chord of the girder truss. The cleat also has a cut away section 
which avoids the possibility of interference with ceiling linings. The supported 
truss can also be located on either side of the cleat making the location of the 
bracket much simpler.
The HiLoad Girder Bracket is suitable for girder truss bottom chords of 
130mm and deeper. Whereas, the MidLoad Girder Bracket incorporates M12 
bolts, therefore reducing cost and allowing the use of 90mm bottom chords.

GUARDRAIL SYSTEMS
Where guardrails are attached to overhangs, additional overhang stiffeners 
may be required. The Tables 8 and 9 provide maximum unstiffened overhang 
distances for top chords supporting guardrail posts. Where stiffeners are 
required to support guardrail, the maximum overhang distance is the same 
as the unstiffened top chord which only supports the design roof loading.
These recommendations only apply where:
1.	Trusses have been designed and manufactured by authorised MiTek 
fabricators.
2.	Guardrail loads are as specified in AS 1657-1992 ‘Fixed platforms, 
walkways, stairways and ladders-Design, construction and installation’.
3.	Only one guardrail post is to be fitted to a truss overhang.
4.	Maximum spacing of guardrail posts in 2400mm.
5.	A guardrail post is not to be fixed to a jack rafter whose total length is less 
than twice its overhang.
6.	Guardrail posts are not fixed to the gable end or raking trusses. All guardrail 
systems used on gable ends are to restrain guardrail system loads 
independently of raking truss.
7.	Guardrails should be fixed continuously around the corners, such as hip 
ends of roofs with minimum of two guardrail posts in both directions 
before the rail is spliced.
IMPORTANT NOTES:
1.	These recommendations are not suitable for supporting fall-arrest systems 
and devices.
2.	Truss modifications in this sheet have been checked for top chord/jack 
rafter fixed guardrail systems only.
3.	No truss members are to be cut or drilled, to enable the fixing of guardrail posts.
Truss Modifications
A stiffener member is to be fixed to the side of a jack rafter or truss top 
chord overhang at each point where a guardrail post is located and where the 
overhang exceeds the value in Table 8 and 9.
The stiffener is to be continuous and extend from the end of the overhang to 
the first panel point of the truss top chord plus 200mm or to the entire length 
of a jack rafter. Refer to detail A.
Stiffener is to be the same grade as the overhang and fixed with minimum 
65mm long by 2.8mm diameter nails, staggered to one side only as shown 
in Figure 3. In addition, fix two nails at the truss heel (or support point) and 
at ends of the stiffener. Where screws are used in lieu of nails, use minimum 
No. 10 gauge screws at the same spacing and pattern, provided that they 
penetrate a minimum of 75% into the thickness of the final receiving member.

TRUSS INSTALLATION CHECKLIST
When installing your roof trusses use the following checklist to ensure  
a quality job and to avoid overlooking any important aspects.
Supporting Structure
❏
❏Check that all top plates that support trusses are level and straight.  
(Any misalignment of supporting structure will be reflected in the 
straightness of the roof.)
❏
❏Check that the distance between supporting walls match the spans of the 
trusses.
❏
❏Are the tops of internal non-load bearing walls set down below that of 
external load bearing walls?
❏
❏Are lintels in load bearing walls suitable for truss loading?
❏
❏Is supporting structure fully braced, plumb and stable?
Roof Trusses
❏
❏Have trusses been stored and lifted in accordance with these instructions?
❏
❏Are trusses free of any modifications, cut members or broken members?
❏
❏Does the truss design criteria on the documentation conform to the job 
specification for roof cladding and special loads, eg roof mounted hot 
water tanks, air conditioners, etc?
❏
❏Are trusses correctly positioned according to truss layout plan?
❏
❏Are trusses accurately spaced?
❏
❏Have cantilever or internally supported trusses been orientated correctly 
i.e. are “Support Here” labels located above bearing walls?
❏
❏Are trusses installed within installation tolerances:
❏
❏(a)	Plumb - All sections of truss less than 50mm or height/50  
	
out of vertical?
❏
❏(b)	Bow - All chord bows less than 50mm or chord length/200?
❏
❏Are all multiple ply trusses nailed/screwed/bolted together?
❏
❏Are all waling plates fixed to truss as per design?
❏
❏Is gable end framing as per design?
❏
❏Do all trusses in corrosive environments have stainless steel plates  
and/or other suitable protection?
Temporary Bracing
❏
❏Are top chord temporary ties no greater than 3000mm spacing?
❏
❏Are bottom chord temporary ties no greater the 4000mm spacing?
Permanent Bracing
TOP CHORD BRACING
❏
❏Is the SpeedBrace configuration correct according to “Fixing & Bracing 
Guidelines”?
❏
❏Is the SpeedBrace apex fixing correct according to “Fixing & Bracing 
Guidelines”?
❏
❏Is the SpeedBrace fixing to each truss top chord correct according to 
“Fixing & Bracing Guidelines”?
❏
❏Is the SpeedBrace to top plate fixing correct according to “Fixing & 
Bracing Guidelines”?
❏
❏Is the SpeedBrace splice detail correct according to “Fixing & Bracing 
Guidelines”?
❏
❏Has all cantilever and web bracing been installed as per design?
❏
❏Have all web ties been installed and braced back to a rigid part of the 
building with cross braces?
❏
❏Are roof battens of correct size and grade?
❏
❏Are roof battens fixed to each truss including to each ply of double & triple 
girders using the correct size nails?
❏
❏Are roof battens spliced correctly:
❏
❏(a)	no more than 1 in 3 on any truss?
❏
❏(b)	no 2 splices adjacent on any truss and none in unbraced zones of 	
	
gable roof ends?
❏
❏Are intermediate top chord ties fixed between saddle trusses (if applicable)?
BOTTOM CHORD BRACING
❏
❏For suspended ceilings or where furring channels are “clipped” to bottom 
chords: have bottom chord ties and diagonal bracing been installed  
in accordance with AS 4440?
Truss Connection Details
❏
❏Have trusses been fixed to top plates correctly at:
❏
❏(a)	load bearing wall i.e. Trip-L-Grip?
