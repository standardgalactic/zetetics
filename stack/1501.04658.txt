Abstract. We exploit the equivalence between t-structures and normal tor-
sion theories on a stable ∞-category to show how a few classical topics in
the theory of triangulated categories, i.e., the characterization of bounded
t-structures in terms of their hearts, their associated cohomology functors,
semiorthogonal decompositions, and the theory of tiltings, as well as the
more recent notion of Bridgeland’s slicings, are all particular instances of a
single construction, namely, the tower of a morphism associated with a J-
slicing of a stable ∞-category C, where J is a totally ordered set equipped
with a monotone Z-action.

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
where each Xn is n-connected and each map Xn −→Xn−1 is a ﬁbration that
induces isomorphisms in π>n, and has an Eilenberg-MacLane space K(πn(X), n−
1) as its ﬁber. This result admits an immediate generalization to an arbitrary
ambient category which is “good enough” for homotopy theory. It is indeed a
statement about the decomposition of an initial morphism ∗−→X into a tower
of ﬁbrations whose ﬁbers have homotopy concentrated in a single degree. It is
nevertheless only in the setting of (∞, 1)-category theory that this result can be
given its cleanest conceptualization: the tower of a pointed object X is the result of
the factorization of ∗−→X with respect to the collection of factorization systems
(n-conn, n-trunc) whose right classes are given by n-truncated morphisms [Lur09,
5.2.8.16].
Of course, a similar construction can be exported to stable homotopy theory,
where the analogue of the factorization system (n-conn, n-trunc) is given by the
canonical t-structure t on the category of spectra, determined by the objects whose
homotopy groups vanish in negative an non-negative degree, respectively,
Sp≥0 = {A∗∈Sp | πi(A∗) = 0; i < 0}
Sp<0 = {B∗∈Sp | πi(B∗) = 0; i ≥0},
together with all its shifts tn = t[n].1
In this context, it becomes natural to
consider the whole {tn | n ∈Z} as a single object, namely the orbit of t under the
canonical action of the group of integers on the class ts(Sp) of t-structures on the
category of spectra. A closer look at this example makes it evident that this action
is also monotone with respect to the natural structure of partially ordered class of
ts(Sp), and the natural total order of Z: more formally, the group homomorphism
Z −→Aut(ts(Sp)) deﬁning the action is also a monotone mapping.
The aim of this paper is to investigate the consequences of taking this point of
view further on the classical theory of t-structures. In particular, we describe all
the terminology we need about partially ordered groups and their actions in §2,
and then we specialize the discussion to Z-actions on partially ordered sets. This
is motivated by the fact that the class of t-structures on a given stable ∞-category
carries a natural choice of such an action.
Even if we employ a rather systematic approach, we do not aim at reaching
a complete generality, but instead at gathering a number of useful results and
nomenclature we can refer to along the present article. Among various possible
choices, we mention specialized references as [Bly05,Gla99,Fuc63] for an extended
discussion of the theory of actions on ordered groups.
We introduce the deﬁnition of a slicing of a poset J (Def. 3.1) and of a J-
slicing of a stable ∞-category C (Def. 3.11) in §3: of course these are not original
1Here and in the rest of the paper we are implicitly using the equivalence between t-structures
and normal torsion theories: if C is a stable ∞-category with a terminal object, there exists an
antitone Galois connection between the poset Rex(C) of reﬂective subcategories of C and the poset
pf(C) of prefactorization systems on C such that r(F) is a 3-for-2 class. This adjunction induces
a bijective correspondence between the class of certain reﬂective and coreﬂective factorization
systems called normal torsion theories and the class of t-structures on (the homotopy category
of) C: this statement is the central result of [FL16] where it is called the Rosetta stone theorem,
and motivates our choice to state our main results in the setting of stable (∞, 1)-categories.

deﬁnitions, as the notion is classical in order theory under diﬀerent names; our
only purpose here is to collect the minimal amount of theory for the sake of clarity.
Namely, in the same spirit of Dedekind’s construction of real numbers, we consider
decompositions of a poset J (more often than not, a totally ordered one) into an
upper and lower set, and associate with each such a decomposition a t-structure
on an ambient (∞, 1)-category C. The totally ordered set J will be assumed to be
equipped with a monotone action of Z and the correspondence
{slicings of J} −→{t-structures on C}.
will be monotone and Z-equivariant.
Now, following [BBD82], (bounded) t-structures on a triangulated category can
be seen as the datum of a set of (co)homological functors indexed by integers;
thus a J-slicings can be seen as a generalization to “fractal” or “ non-integer”
cohomological dimensions now indexed by J and not by Z. Namely, each J-slicing
induces local cohomology objects depending on an interval, as discussed in §4.
In this framework many homological features appear as a shadow of clear con-
structions with totally ordered sets with Z-actions. For instance, when the totally
ordered set J has a heart J, i.e., when there’s a Z-equivariant monotone mor-
phism J −→Z, a J-slicing on a stable ∞-category C is precisely the datum of a
t-structure on C together with a collection of torsion theories parametrized by J
on the heart of C, which turns out to be an abelian ∞-category. This is shown §5
and §7.
In §6, we recover the theory of classical semi-orthogonal decompositions by con-
sidering the case when Z acts trivially on J. Semi-orthogonal decompositions and
J-slicing with hearts are essentially the only two interesting classes, as shown by
the structure theorem we prove in section §8: under suitable ﬁniteness assump-
tions, the datum of a J-slicing on a stable ∞-category C is equivalent to the
datum of a ﬁnite type semi-orthogonal decomposition of C, together with bounded
t-structures on the slices and collections of torsion theories on the hearts of these
t-structures (Theorem 8.2). It is worth mentioning that, under the ﬁniteness con-
ditions of Theorem 8.2, when J = R the notion of J-slicing as discussed in the
present paper actually becomes a reinterpretation of Bridgeland’s deﬁnition of slic-
ing of a triangulated category [Bri07]. This can be better appreciated by switching
to the general approach to ‘stability data’ introduced by [GKR04].
Finally, in §7 we show how the functoriality of the association J 7→{J-slicings}
gives rise to an elegant and synthetic reformulation of classical tilting theory
[HRS96].
1.1. Notation and conventions. We will work within the framework of stable
∞-categories in the sense of [Lur17]. The reader who prefers to work in the more
traditional framework of triangulated categories will ﬁnd no diﬃculty in pretend-
ing that all higher categories are instead categories and that all ﬁber sequences are
distinguished triangles; indeed, many of our statements and constructions are actu-
ally adjustments of classical arguments valid in triangulated categories. However a
few proofs become more natural when stated in the language of stable ∞-categories

(for example, theorems whose proof involves a certain universal property unavail-
able in the triangulated world).
To make the article more self-contained and enjoyable to a reader with no
previous exposure to stable ∞-categories, we recall here the minimal amount of
∞-categorical notions we will make use of. As in [Lur09], we will call ‘∞-category’
an (∞, 1)-category, i.e. an higher category whose k-morphisms are invertible (up
to homotopy) for any k > 1. In colloquial terms, this means that an ∞-category
has objects, morphisms, homotopies between morphisms, homotopies between ho-
motopies, etc., and such homotopies are all invertible. As shown in [Lur09,Joy08a],
the entire theory of categories transports to ∞-categories. In particular, an ∞-
category C can have ﬁnite co/limits.
Deﬁnition [Stable ∞-category]: An ∞-category C is said to be stable if it has
all ﬁnite limits and all ﬁnite colimits, and if in addition it satisﬁes the so-called
pullout axiom: a diagram
X
/

Y

Z
/ T
in C (or, more formally, an object of the functor category C□) is a pushout if and
only if it is a pullback.
We will henceforth call these diagrams pullout diagrams or simply pullouts. The
pullout axiom is inherently ∞-categorical: the only ordinary category with ﬁnite
limits and colimits satisfying it is the trivial category (i.e. the terminal additive
category with a single zero object 0). It is also extremely powerful: if C is a stable
∞-category, then its homotopy category hC is triangulated. In other words, this
single and extremely simple axiom subsumes all of the axiomatic of triangulated
categories (the notorious octahedral axiom included).
Unfortunately not every triangulated category can be realized as the homotopy
category of a stable ∞-category, see [MSS07]; stable ∞-categories therefore only
give rise to ‘well-behaved’ triangulated categories. It should however be remarked
that ill-behaved ones are often artiﬁcial: the reader can then safely assume that
essentially every ‘reasonable’ triangulated category is the homotopy category hC
of some stable ∞-category C.
As already said, a particularly pleasant consequence of this good behaviour
is the fact that in a stable ∞-category the notions of t-structure [BBD82] and
of normal factorization system (or normal torsion theory) [CHK85] are naturally
equivalent; this remains true in a triangulated category, although the equivalence
is much less transparent (see [LV17], where this issue is framed in a fairly more gen-
eral environment). This equivalence will be used several times along the discussion,
as well as the following result from [FL16]:
Lemma
[Sator lemma]: If (E, M) is a factorization system on a stable ∞-
category C, with the property that both E and M saisfy the ‘two out of three’
property, then for every object A ∈C an initial arrow 0 −→A lies in E (resp. in

M) if and only if the terminal arrow A −→0 of the same object lies in E (resp.
in M).

2. Posets with Z-actions.
為無為。事無事。味無味。

This section introduces the terminology about partially ordered groups and
their actions, and then specializes the discussion to Z-actions. We do not aim
at a complete generality, but instead at gathering a number of useful results and
nomenclature which is useful to have at hand. Among various possible choices, we
mention specialized references as [Bly05,Gla99,Fuc63] for an extended discussion
of the theory of actions on ordered groups.
We begin by recalling the well known fact that the category Pos of partially
ordered sets and monotone maps is cartesian closed. Namely, the product order
on the cartesian product P × Q of two posets (P, ≤) and (Q, ≤), given by (x, y) ≤
(x′, y′) if and only if x ≤x′ and y ≤y′ makes (P × Q, ≤) together with the
projections on the factors satisfy the universal property of the product in the
category of posets. Moreover, the set Pos(P, Q) of monotone maps from (P, ≤) to
(Q, ≤) has a natural order on it given by f ≤g if and only if f(x) ≤g(x) for every
x in P. With this order one has an adjunction
Pos(P × Q, R) ∼= Pos(P, Pos(Q, R)).
Remark 2.1 : The product order is not the only standard order one puts on the
product P × Q of two posets P and Q. Another commonly used one is the lexi-
cographic order deﬁned by (x, y) ≤lex (x′, y′) if and only if x < x′ or x = x′ and
y ≤y′. The lexicographic order does not make P × Q be the product of P and Q
in the category of posets, but it still has a few peculiar properties that, as we are
going to see, are relevant to the theory of slicings.
Remark 2.2 : Let (P, ≤) be a poset, and let ∼be an equivalence relation on the
set P. One says that ∼is compatible with the order relation if x ≤y, x ∼x′ and
y ∼y′ imply x′ ≤y′ or x′ ∼y′. When this happens the quotient set P/∼inherits
a order relation from P by [x] ≤[y] if and only if x ≤y or x ∼y. Moreover the
projection to the quotient P −→P/∼is a morphism of posets.
Deﬁnition 2.3 : A partially ordered group (“po-group” for short) is a pair (G, ≤)
consisting of a group G and of a partial order relation ≤on G such that the group
multiplication ·: G × G −→G is a map of posets, where G × G is endowed with
the product order: for any two pairs (g, h) and (g′, h′) with g ≤g′ and h ≤h′ we
have gg′ ≤hh′.

Remark 2.4 : In the literature on the subject it is customary draw a distinction be-
tween a left po-group and a right po-group. We choose to ignore this subtlety, since
all the po-groups we will be dealing with will be ordered by two-sided congruences.
Remark 2.5 : If (G, ≤) is a po-group, the inversion (
)−1 : G −→G is an antitone
antiautomorphism of groups, i.e. we have that g ≤h if and only if h−1 ≤g−1.
Moreover the set G+ of positive elements, i.e. the set {g ∈G | 1 ≤g} is closed
under conjugation.
Example 2.6 : Let (P, ≤) be a poset, and let AutPos(P) be the automorphism group
of P as a poset, i.e., the set of monotone bijections of p into itself. Then AutPos(P)
inherits an order relation by its inclusion in the poset Pos(P, P), and this makes
AutPos(P) a partially ordered group. This is the standard po-group structure on
AutPos(P).
Remark 2.7 : Any group G can be seen as a po-group with the trivial order relation
g ≤h if and only if g = h. It is worth noticing that on ﬁnite groups the trivial
order is the only possible po-group structure.
Namely, assume g ≤h and let
k = g−1h. Then we have 1 ≤k ≤k2 ≤k2 ≤· · · ≤kord(k) = 1 and so k = 1, i.e.,
g = h.
Deﬁnition 2.8 : A homomorphism of po-groups consists of a group morphism
f : G −→H which is also a monotone mapping.
This deﬁnes a category PG
of partially ordered groups and their homomorphisms.
Deﬁnition 2.9 : Let (G, ≤) be a po-group. A G-poset is a partially ordered set
(P, ≤) endowed with a po-group homomorphism G −→AutPos(P) to the group of
order isomorphisms of P with its standard po-group structure.
Remark 2.10 : Equivalently, a G-poset is a partially ordered set P together with
a group action G × P −→P which is a morphism of posets, where on G × P one
has the product order.
Example 2.11 : Every po-group G is a G-poset with the multiplication action of G
on itself.
Remark 2.12 : An equivalence relation ∼on a G-poset P is said to be compatible
with the G-action if x ∼y implies g · x ∼g · y for any g in G. If ∼is compatible
both with the order and with the G-action then the quotient set P/∼is naturally a
G-poset with the G-action g · [x] = [g · x]. Moreover the projection to the quotient
is a morphism of G-posets.
We now specialize our discussion to the case G = Z
Deﬁnition 2.13 : A Z-poset is a partially ordered set (P, ≤) together with a group
action
+P : P × Z −→P : (x, n) 7→x +P n
which is a morphism of partially ordered sets, when Z is regarded with its usual
total order.

Remark 2.14 : It is immediate to see that a Z-poset is equivalently the datum of a
poset (P, ≤) together with a monotone bijection ρ: P −→P such that x ≤ρ(x) for
any x in P. The function ρ and the action are related by the identity ρ(x) = x+P 1.
Notation 2.15 : To avoid a cumbersome accumulation of indices, the action +P
will be often denoted as a simple “+”. This is meant to evoke in the reader the
most natural example of a Z-poset, given by Z itself, and to simplify our notation
for the axioms of an action:
(
(x +P m) +P n = x +P (m + n);
x +P 0 = x.
We will also write x −n for x +P (−n).
Example 2.16 : The poset (Z, ≤) of integers with their usual order is a Z-poset with
the action given by the usual sum of integers. The poset (R, ≤) of real numbers
with their usual order is a Z-poset for the action given by the sum of real numbers
with integers (seen as a subring of real numbers).
Example 2.17 : Given any poset (P, ≤), the poset Z ×lex P carries a natural Z-
action given by (n, x) + 1 = (n + 1, x), i.e., by the standard Z-action on the ﬁrst
factor and by the trivial Z-action on the second factor.
Remark 2.18 : If (P, ≤) is a ﬁnite poset, then the only Z-action it carries is the
trivial one. Indeed, if ρ: P −→P is the monotone bijection associated with the
Z-action, one sees that ρ is a ﬁnite order element in AutPos(P), by the ﬁniteness
of P. Therefore there exists an n ≥1 such that ρn = idP . It follows that, for any
x in P,
x ≤x + 1 ≤· · · ≤x + n = x
and so x = x + 1.
Remark 2.19 : An obvious terminology: a G-ﬁxed point for a G-poset P is an
element p ∈P kept ﬁxed by all the elements of G under the G-action. Clearly, an
element x of a Z-poset P is a Z-ﬁxed point if and only if x+1 = x, or equivalently
x −1 = x. From this it immediately follows that if x ∈P is a ≤-maximal or
≤-minimal element in the Z-poset P, then it is a Z-ﬁxed point.
Remark 2.20 : Given a poset P we can always deﬁne a partial order on the set
P⊳⊲= P ∪{−∞, +∞} which extends the partial order on P by the rule −∞≤
x ≤+∞for any x ∈P.
Lemma 2.21 : If (P, ≤) is a Z-poset, then (P⊳⊲, ≤) carries a natural Z-action ex-
tending the Z-action on P, by declaring both −∞and +∞to be Z-ﬁxed points.
Proof. Adding a ﬁxed point always gives an extension of an action, so we only need
to check that the extended action is compatible with the partial order. This is
equivalent to checking that also on P⊳⊲the map x 7→x+1 is a monotone bijection
such that x ≤x + 1, which is immediate.
□
Posets with Z-actions naturally form a category Z-Pos, whose morphisms are
Z-equivariant morphisms of posets. More explicitly, if P and Q are Z-posets with

8
HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
actions +P and +Q, then a morphism of Z-posets between them is a morphism of
posets ϕ: P −→Q such that
ϕ(x +P n) = ϕ(x) +Q n,
for any x ∈P and any n ∈Z.
Remark 2.22 : If P and Q are Z-posets, then the hom-set Z-Pos(P, Q) is naturally
a Z-poset. Namely, as we have already remarked, Pos(P, Q) is naturally a poset,
and so Z-Pos(P, Q) inherits the poset structure as a subset. The Z-action is given
by (ϕ + n)(x) = ϕ(x) +Q n. This makes Z-Pos a closed category.
Remark 2.23 : Every poset can be seen as a Z-poset with the trivial Z-action. Since
every monotone mapping is Z-equivariant with respect to the trivial Z-action, this
gives a fully faithful embedding Pos −→Z-Pos.
Lemma 2.24 : The choice of an element x in a Z-poset P is equivalent to the datum
of a Z-equivariant morphism ϕ: (Z, ≤) −→(P, ≤). Moreover x is a Z-ﬁxed point if
and only if the corresponding morphism ϕ factors Z-equivariantly through (∗, ≤),
where ∗denotes the terminal object of Pos.
Proof. To the element x one associates the Z-equivariant morphism ϕx deﬁned
by ϕx(n) = x + n. To the Z-equivariant morphism ϕ one associates the element
xϕ = ϕ(0).
It is immediate to check that the two constructions are mutually
inverse. The proof of the second part of the statement is straightforward.
□
Lemma 2.25 : Let ϕ: (Z, ≤) −→(P, ≤) be a Z-equivariant morphism of Z-posets.
Then ϕ is either injective or constant.
Proof. Assume ϕ is not injective. then there exist two integers n and m with
n > m such that ϕ(n) = ϕ(m). By Z-equivariancy we therefore have
xϕ + (n −m) = xϕ,
with n−m ≥1 and xϕ = ϕ(0). The conclusion then follows by the same argument
used in Remark 2.18.
□
Lemma 2.26 : Let ϕ: (P, ≤) −→(Q, ≤) be a morphism of Z-posets. Assume Q
has a minimum and a maximum.
Then ϕ extends to a morphism of Z-posets
(P⊳⊲, ≤) −→(Q, ≤) by setting ϕ(−∞) = min(Q) and ϕ(+∞) = max(Q).
Proof. Since min(Q) and max(Q) are Z-ﬁxed points by Remark 2.19, the extended
ϕ is a morphism of Z-posets. Moreover, since min(Q) and max(Q) are the mini-
mum and the maximum of Q, respectively, the extended ϕ is indeed a morphism
of posets, and so it is a morphism of Z-posets.
□
All of the above applies in particular to totally ordered sets. We will denote by
Tos ⊆Pos the full subcategory of totally ordered sets, and by Z-Tos ⊆Z-Pos the
full subcategory of Z-actions on totally ordered sets.
Lemma 2.27 : Let (P, ≤) be a totally ordered Z-poset. The relation x ∼y if and
only if there are integers a, b ∈Z such that x + a ≤y ≤x + b is an equivalence
relation on P compatible with both the order and the Z-action.
It therefore

induces a morphism of Z-posets P −→P/∼given by the projection to the quotient.
Moreover, P/∼is totally ordered and the Z-action on the quotient is trivial.
Proof. Checking that ∼is an equivalence relation is immediate: reﬂexivity is man-
ifest; symmetry reduces to noticing that x + a ≤y ≤x + b is equivalent to
y −b ≤x ≤y −a; transitivity follows by the fact that x + a ≤y ≤x + b and
y + c ≤z ≤y + d together imply x + (a + c) ≤z ≤x + (b + d). To see that ∼
is compatible with the order relation, let x ≤y and let x ∼x′ and y ∼y′. Then
there exist a, b, c and d in Z such that x + a ≤x′ ≤x + b and y + c ≤y′ ≤y + d.
Since P is totally ordered, either x′ ≤y′ or y′ ≤x′. In the second case we have
y′ ≤x′ ≤x + b ≤y + b ≤y′ + b −c, and so x′ ∼y′ by deﬁnition of the relation
∼. The compatibility of ∼with the Z-action is straightforward. Therefore by
Remarks 2.2 and 2.12 we see that the projection to the quotient P −→P/∼is a
morphism of Z-posets. Since the order on P is total, so is also the order induced
by ∼on the quotient set. Finally, to see that the Z action on P/∼is trivial, just
notice that for any x in P, we have x ≤x + 1 ≤x + 1 and so [x] + 1 = [x].
□
Remark 2.28 : If the Z-action on the totally ordered set P is trivial, then the
equivalence relation from Lemma 2.27 is trivial as well: x ∼y if and only if x = y.
Lemma 2.29 : Let (P, ≤) be a totally ordered Z-poset, and let ∼be the equivalence
relation from Lemma 2.27. Then either [x] = {x} or [x] = Z ×lex [x, x + 1), where
[x, x + 1) = {y ∈P | x ≤y < x + 1}
Proof. Let x ∈P; then either x = x + 1 or x < x + 1. In the ﬁrst case x is a ﬁxed
point for the Z-action on P and so the equivalence relation ∼is the trivial one:
y ∼x if and only if y = x. If x < x + 1 then the interval [x, x + 1) is nonempty, as
x ∈[x, x + 1).
Let ϕ: Z ×lex [x, x + 1) −→P the map deﬁned by (n, y) 7→y + n. The map ϕ
is a morphism of Z-posets.
Indeed, if (n, y) ≤lex (n′, y′) either n < n′ or n = n′ and y ≤y′. In the ﬁrst
case we have n + 1 ≤n′ and so y + n < x + 1 + n ≤x + n′ ≤y′ + n′, whereas in
the second case we have y + n ≤y′ + n = y′ + n′. The map ϕ is also injective.
To conclude we only need to show that ϕ: Z ×lex [x, x + 1) −→[x] is surjective.
Let z ∈[x]. By deﬁnition of the equivalence relation there exist a, b in Z such
that x + a ≤z ≤x + b.
Since x is not a Z-ﬁxed point, we have a ≤b and
z ∈[x + a, x + b + 1). Writing
[x + a, x + b + 1) =
b[
n=a
[x + n, x + n + 1)
we see that there exists n ∈Z such that z ∈[x, x + 1) + n, i.e., z = ϕ(n, y) for
some y in [x, x + 1).
□
Proposition 2.30 : The fully faithful embedding (
)♭: Tos −→Z-Tos given by
trivial Z-actions on totally ordered sets has a left adjoint.
Proof. For any totally ordered Z-poset P, let ι(P) be the Z-poset P/∼, where ∼
is the equivalence relation from Lemma 2.27. Then I : Z-Tos −→Tos is a functor,

10
HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
since if f : P −→Q is a morphism of Z-posets then x + a ≤y ≤x + b implies
f(x) + a = f(x + a) ≤f(y) ≤f(x + b) = f(x) + b
and so f induces a well deﬁned morphism of sets ˜f : ι(P) −→ι(Q). It is immediate
to see that ˜f is actually a morphism of Z-posets and that f ⇝˜f preserves identities
and compositions of morphisms. Finally, to see that I is a right adjoint to the
trivial action embedding Tos −→Z-Tos, let P be a a totally ordered Z-poset and Q
be a totally ordered set. Since I is a functor, a morphism of Z-posets f : P −→Q♭
induces a morphism of posets ˜f : ι(P) −→ι(Q♭). Moreover, since the Z-action on
Q♭is trivial, we have ι(Q♭) ∼= Q, see Remark 2.28. Therefore, f 7→˜f deﬁnes a
map
Z-Tos(P, Q♭) −→Tos(ι(P), Q)
which we want to show is a bijection.
Assume ˜f1 = ˜f2.
Then, for any x in
P we have f1(x) ∼f2(x) in Q♭. Since the equivalence relation on Q♭is trivial,
this means f1 = f2, so f ⇝˜f is injective. Let now ϕ be a morphism of posets,
ϕ: ι(P) −→Q, and let f = ϕ ◦π where π: P −→ι(P) is the projection to the
quotient. We have ˜f([x]) = [f(x)] = f(x) = ϕ(π(x)) = ϕ([x]), and so ϕ = ˜f, i.e.,
f ⇝˜f is surjective.

3. Histoire d’O(J).
Sa liberté était pire que n’importe quelle chaîne
D. Aury
Recall that a lower set in a poset J is a subset L ⊆J such that if x ∈L and
y ≤x then y ∈L; the set of lower sets of J is denoted ⇃J and it naturally a
partially ordered set. Dually, one deﬁnes upper sets and the set ↿J of upper sets
with its natural partial order.
Deﬁnition 3.1 : Let J be a poset. A slicing of J is a pair (L, U), where L is a lower
set in J, U is an upper set, L ∩U = ∅and L ∪U = J. The collection of all slicings
of J will be denoted by O(J).
Remark 3.2 : Since the complement of an upper set is a lower set and vice versa,
the projection on the second factor is a bijection
O(J)
∼
−→↿J
This induces a natural partial order on O(J): we set (L1, U1) ≤(L2, U2) if and
only if U2 ⊆U1. Notice that O(J) has a minimum given by the slicing (∅, J) and
a maximum given by the slicing (J, ∅).
Remark 3.3 : If J is totally ordered, then so is O(J). Namely, let U1 and U2 two
upper sets in J and assume that U1 is not a subset of U2. Then there exists an
element x in U1 which is not in U2. If y ∈U2 then either y ≤x or y ≥x since J
is totally ordered. But since U2 is an upper set y ≤x would imply x ∈U2 against
our assumption. This means that y ≥x and, since U1 is an upper set, this implies
y ∈U1. Therefore if U1 is not a subset of U2 we have that U2 ⊆U1.

Remark 3.4 : If J is a Z-poset, then so is O(J). The natural Z-action on O(J) is
given by
(L, U) + n = (L + n, U + n),
where L + n = {x + n | x ∈L} and U + n = {x + n | x ∈U}.
Remark 3.5 : Every element x in J determines two slicings of J: ((−∞, x), [x, +∞))
and ((−∞, x], (x, +∞)).
Here (−∞, x) is the lower set {y ∈J | y < x}, and
similarly for (−∞, x], (x, +∞) and [x, +∞). This gives two natural morphisms of
posets J −→O(J). If J is a Z-poset, then these morphisms are Z-equivariant.
The construction of O(J) is actually functorial in J so that we have the following
Lemma 3.6 : The map J ⇝O(J) deﬁnes a functor
O: Z-Posop −→Z-Pos⊤
where Z-Pos⊤denotes the category of Z-posets with minimum and maximum
and with Z-morphism of posets preserving them (these maps are called {0, 1}-
homomorphisms in lattice theory, see [Grä11]).
Proof. By the above remarks the only thing we have to prove is functoriality.
For any morphism of Z-posets f : J1 −→J2, we set O(f): U −→f −1(U). It is
immediate to see that f −1(U) is an upper set in J2 for any upper set U in J1 an
that f −1(U + 1) = f −1(U) + 1, so that O(f) is indeed a morphism of Z-posets
from O(J2) to O(J1). Moreover we have O(idJ) = idO(J) and O(fg) = O(g)O(f),
and O(f)(∅) = ∅and O(f)(J2) = J1.
□
Remark 3.7 : Since the minimum and the maximum of a Z-poset, when they exist,
are necessarily ﬁxed points of the Z-action, we see that the inclusion Z-Pos⊤(P, Q) ⊆
Z-Pos(P, Q) induces a Z-poset structure on Z-Pos⊤(P, Q) making this inclusion a
morphism of Z-posets.
Example 3.8 : The morphism n 7→[n, +∞) induces an isomorphism of Z-posets

where [1] is the totally ordered set {0 < 1}.
Deﬁnition 3.9 : Before introducing the main deﬁnition of this section, let us recall
that a t-structure on a stable ∞-category C consists of a pair t = (L, U) of full
sub-∞-categories satisfying the following properties:
i) orthogonality: C(X, Y ) is contractible for each X ∈U, Y ∈L;
ii) one has U[1] ⊆U and L[−1] ⊆L;
iii) Any object X ∈C ﬁts into a (homotopy) ﬁber sequence XU −→X −→XL,
with XU in U and XL in L.
We introduce further terminology as a separate remark:

12
HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
Remark 3.10 : The categories L and U are called the lower sub-∞-category and
the upper sub-∞-category of the t-structure t, respectively.
The collection ts(C) of all t-structures on a stable ∞-category C is a poset
with respect to following order relation: given two t-structures t1 = (L1, U1) and
t2 = (L2, U2), one has t1 ≤t2 if and only if U2 ⊆U1.
The ordered group Z acts on ts(C) in a way that is ﬁxed by the action of
the generator +1; this maps a t-structure t = (L, U) to the shifted t-structure
t[1] = (L[1], U[1]).
Since t ≤t[1] one sees that ts(C) is naturally a Z-poset.
Finally, the poset ts(C) has a minimum and a maximum given by (0, C) and
(C, 0), respectively. These are called the trivial t-structures.
Deﬁnition 3.11 : Let (J, ≤) be a Z-poset. A J-slicing of a stable ∞-category C
is a Z-equivariant morphism of posets t: O(J) −→ts(C) respecting minima and
maxima on both sides. We denote as 切(J, C) the class of all J-slicings of the
category C;2
More explicitly, a J-slicing is a family {t(L,U)}(L,U)∈O(J) of t-structures on C
such that
i) t(L1,U1) ≤t(L2,U2) if (L1, U1) ≤(L2, U2) in O(J);
ii) t(L,U)+1 = t(L,U)[1] for any (L, U) ∈O(J).
iii) t(∅,J) = (0, C) and t(J,∅) = (C, 0).
Remark 3.12 : Of course, 切(J, C) = Z-Pos⊤(O(J), ts(C)): this, together with 3.6
and 3.7, gives that J 7→切(J, C) is a functor.
Notation 3.13 : We will denote the lower and the upper sub-∞-categories of the
t-structure t(L,U) by CL and CU, respectively, i.e., we write t(L,U) = (CL, CU). For
i ∈J, we will write C≥i, C>i, C≤i and C<i for C[i,+∞), C(i,+∞), C(−∞,i] and C(−∞,i),
respectively. Note that, by Z-equivariancy, we have C≥i+1 = C≥i[1], and similarly
for the other cases.
Example 3.14 : By Lemma 2.24 and Example 3.8, a Z-slicing on C is equivalent
to the datum of a t-structure t0 = (C<0, C≥0). One has tn = (C<n, C≥n) for any
n ∈Z, consistently with the Notation 3.13, t−∞= (0, C) and t+∞= (C, 0). Notice
that by our Remark 2.18, as soon as C≥1 is a proper subcategory of C≥0, then the
inclusion C≥n+1 ⊆C≥n is proper for all n ∈Z, i.e. the orbit t + Z is an inﬁnite
set. The equivalence between t-structures and Z-slicings can also be seen in the
light of Remark 3.12: for every Z-poset P with minimum and maximum one has
a distinguished isomorphism Z-Pos⊤(O(Z), P)
∼
−→P given by ϕ 7→ϕ([0, +∞))
Example 3.15 : By Example 3.8, an R-slicing on C is the datum of two t-structures
(C<λ, C≥λ) and (C≤λ, C>λ) on C for any λ ∈R in such a way that C≥λ+1 = C≥λ[1],
etc., and with the inclusions C>λ ⊆C≥λ for any λ ∈R and
C>λ2 ⊆C≥λ2 ⊆C>λ1 ⊆C≥λ1
for any λ1 < λ2 in R.
R-slicings have been introduced in [Bri07], where they
are called simply “slicings”. Actually [Bri07] imposes more restrictive conditions

to ensure “compactness” of the factorization, we will come back to this later.
Compare also [GKR04].
Remark 3.16 : Since the subcategories CL and CU are the lower and the upper
subcategories of a t-structure t(L,U) they are reﬂexive and coreﬂective, respectively.
In particular we have reﬂection and coreﬂection functors
RL : C −→CL;
SU : C −→CU.
For X an object in C we will occasionally write XL for RLX and XU for SUX,
and similarly for morphisms. Finally, by composing RLand SU with the inclusions
of CL and CU in C, we can look at RL and SU as endofunctors of C.
In order to investigate properties of the (co-)reﬂections S and R, we recall
the main result from [FL16]: there is an equivalence between t-structures on C
and normal factorization systems on C, so that t can equivalently be seen as a
Z-equivariant morphism O(J) −→fs(C), where fs(C) denotes the Z-poset of
normal factorization systems of C. Explicitly, this equivalence is given as follows:
given a t-structure (L, U) on C, the corresponding factorization system (E, M) is
characterized by
0 −→X is in E if and only if X ∈U
X −→0 is in M if and only if X ∈L
Since we are going to use this fact several times, we recall that both the class E
and the class M have the 3-for-2 property. In particular this implies the Sator
lemma:
(0 −→X) is in E if and only if (X −→0) is in E
(X −→0) is in M if and only if (0 −→X) is in M
For further information on normal factorization systems in stable ∞-categories we
address the reader to [FL16,Lor16].
Remark 3.17 : Notice that the left class E of the normal factorization system (E, M)
corresponds to the right class U of the corresponding t-structure (L, U). One could
avoid this position switch by writing the pair of classes in a t-structure as (U, L),
however we preferred to keep the upper class on the right to agree with the standard
orientation on the line of real numbers.
Remark 3.18 : Since (E, M) are a factorization system, the class M is closed under
pullbacks and the class E is closed under pushouts. Together with the Sator lemma
this implies that L and U are extension closed.
Lemma 3.19 : Let t be a J-slicing of C and let (L0, U0) and (L1, U1) two slicings of
J with (L0, U0) ≤(L1, U1). Then we have the natural isomorphisms
i) RL0RL1 ∼= RL1RL0 ∼= RL0;
ii) SU0SU1 ∼= SU1SU0 ∼= SU1;
iii) RL0SU1 ∼= SU1RL0 ∼= 0.

Proof. It is enough to prove (i) and (iii), as the proof of (ii) is dual to (i).
We denote t0 and t1 the t-structures corresponding to (L0, U0) and (L1, U1),
respectively, and by (E0, M0) and (E1, M1) the corresponding normal torsion the-
ories. Since (L0, U0) ≤(L1, U1) we have M0 ⊆M1 and E1 ⊆E0.
The object S1X is obtained by (E1, M1)-factoring the arrow 0 −→X as 0
E1
−→
S1X
M1
−−→X.
Since E1 ⊆E0, this shows that 0 −→S1X is in E0 and so, by
the Sator lemma, also S1X −→0 is in E0. Now the object R0S1X is obtained
by the (E0, M0)-factorization of the terminal morphism S1X −→0 as S1X
E0
−→
R0S1X
M0
−−→0.
By the 3-for-2 property for E0 we see that R0S1X −→0 lies in E0 ∩M0, hence
it an isomorphism, so that R0S1X ∼= 0. The proof that S1R0X ∼= X is perfectly
dual. This proves (iii).
The proof of (i) goes as follows.
The reﬂection R0R1X is deﬁned by the
(E0, M0)-factorization R1X
E0
−→R0R1X
M0
−−→0. Since E1 ⊆E0 and X −→R1X
is in E1 we see that X −→R0R1X −→0 is already the (E0, M0)-factorization
of X −→0 and so by uniqueness of the factorization we have R0R1X ∼= R0X.
Finally, the reﬂection R1R0X is deﬁned by the (E1, M1)-factorization R0X
E1
−→
R1R0X
M1
−−→0. Since R0X −→0 is in M0 ⊆M1, by the 3-for-2 property we have
that R0X −→R1R0X is in E1 ∩M1 and so it is an isomorphism.
□
Remark 3.20 : Notice how, in the proof of the above lemma, one sees that applying
RL0 to the natural morphism RL1X −→0 we get a natural morphism RL1X −→
RL0X, an so one has a natural transformation RL1 −→RL0. Dually, we have a
natural transformation SU1 −→SU0.
Lemma 3.21 : Let t be a J-slicing of C and let (L0, U0) and (L1, U1) two slicings of
J with (L0, U0) ≤(L1, U1). Then we have natural isomorphisms
SU0RL1 ∼= RL1SU0
Moreover SU0RL1 is the ﬁber of the natural transformation RL1 −→RL0 and
RL1SU0 is the coﬁber of the natural transformation SU1 −→SU0
Proof. In the same notation as in the proof of Lemma 3.19 we have that E1 ⊆
E0 and M0 ⊆M1. Since both (E0, M0) and (E1, M1) are normal factorization
systems, the isomorphisms of Lemma 3.19 give the diagram

where every square is a pullout. The fact that each class Ei is closed under pushout
and each Mi is closed under pullback now gives that the arrows S0X −→F −→0
and 0 −→F −→R1X are respectively the (E1, M1)-factorization of S0X −→0
and the (E0, M0)-factorization of 0 −→R1X, so that R1S0X ∼= F ∼= S0R1X.
To prove the second part of the statement, notice that by deﬁnition of normal
factorization system associated to the slicing (L0, U0) we have a ﬁber sequence
S0R1X

3.1. A tale of intervals. Although a few of the statements we are going to prove
hold more generally for arbitrary Z-posets, for the remainder of this section we
will restrict our attention to Z-posets which are totally ordered sets.
Deﬁnition 3.22 : Let J be a poset. An interval in J is a subset I ⊆J such that if
x, y ∈I and x ≤z ≤y in J, then z ∈I.
Example 3.23 : Let J be a totally ordered Z-poset, and let ∼be the equivalence
relation from Lemma 2.27. For i ∈J, let Ii be the equivalence class of i. Then
Ii is an interval. Namely, id x, y ∈Ii then there exist integers a, b with i + a ≤x
and y ≤i + b so if x ≤z ≤y then i + a ≤z ≤ib and so z ∼i.
Clearly, the intersection of a lower set and an upper set is an interval. Remark-
ably, in totally ordered sets also the converse is true. Although this is a classical
(and easy) result, we recall its proof for completeness.
Lemma 3.24 : Let J be a totally ordered set. Then a subset I ⊆J is an interval if
and only if I can be written as the intersection of an upper set and a lower set.
Proof. Let
LI =
[
x∈I
(−∞, x];
UI =
[
x∈I
[x, +∞).
Then clearly LI is a lower set, UI is an upper set and we have I ⊆LI ∩UI.
Moreover, if y ∈LI ∩UI then there exist x0, x1 in I such that y ∈(−∞, x1] ∩
[x0, +∞) = [x0, x1]. Since x0 ≤y ≤x1 and I is an interval, we have y ∈I, and so
LI ∩UI ⊆I.
□
Lemma 3.25 : In a totally ordered set, the upper set and the lower set intersecting
in a nonempty interval I are uniquely determined by I.
Proof. Let I ⊆J be a interval and let
UI =
\
U⊇I
U;
LI =
\
L⊇I
L,

16
HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
with U and L ranging over the upper sets and the lower sets in J containing I,
respectively. Then it is clear that I ⊆UI ∩LI and we want to show that actually
I = UI ∩LI and that if I = ˜U ∩˜L then ˜U = UI and ˜L = LI. By Lemma 3.24
there exist an upper set ˜U and a lower set ˜L such that I = ˜U ∩˜L. By deﬁnition
of UI and LI we have UI ⊆˜U and LI ⊆˜L. Therefore I ⊆LI ∩UI ⊆˜L ∩˜U = I
and so I = UI ∩LI. Now we want to show that UI = ˜U. Since UI ⊆U0 we only
need to show that ˜U ⊆UI. Let x ∈˜U and let y ∈I. Since J is totally ordered,
either x ≤y or x ≥y. In the ﬁrst case, since L0 is a lower set, we have x ∈˜L
and so x ∈˜L ∪˜U = I ⊆UI. In the second case, since UI is an upper set, we have
directly x ∈UI.
□
By the above lemma, the following deﬁnition is well-posed.
Deﬁnition 3.26 : Let J be a totally ordered Z-poset and let t: O(J) −→ts(C) be
a J-slicing on a stable ∞-category C. For every nonempty interval I = LI ∩UI in
J we set
CI = CLI ∩CUI.
We also set C∅= {0}.
Remark 3.27 : The whole of J is an interval, with LJ = UJ = J. From Def. 3.26 we
obtain CJ = C, as expected. Also, every upper set U is an interval, with UU = U
and LU = J. So from Def. 3.26 we ﬁnd that the subcategory of C associated to
U as an interval is precisely the subcategory CU associated to U as an upper set.
The same happens for lower sets. This shows that the notation introduced in Def.
3.26 is consistent with the notation for J-slicings.
Example 3.28 : For every i, j in J with i ≤j one has the four intervals (i, j), (i, j],
[i, j), [i, j] and consequently the four subcategories C(i,j), C(i,j], C[i,j) and C[i,j]of
C. In particular for every i ∈J we have the interval [i, i] consisting of the single
element i. To avoid cumbersome notation, we will always write Ci for C[i,i]. The
subcategories Ci with i ranging in J are called the slices of the J-slicing t.
Deﬁnition 3.29 : Let t be a J-slicing on C. We say that C is J-bounded if
C =
[
i,j∈J
C[i,j].
Similarly, we say that C is J-left-bounded if C = S
i∈J C[i,+∞) and J-right-bounded
if C = S
i∈J C(−∞,i].
Remark 3.30 : This notion is well known in the classical as well as in the qua-
sicategorical setting: see [BBD82,Lur17]. In particular, when t is a Z-family of
t-structures on C, then C is Z-bounded (resp., Z-left-bounded, Z-right-bounded) if
and only if C is bounded (resp., left-bounded, right-bounded) with respect to the
t-structure t0, agreeing with the classical deﬁnition of boundedness as given, e.g.,
in [BBD82].
Remark 3.31 : Since C[i,j] = C[i,+∞) ∩C(−∞,j] one immediately sees that C is
J-bounded if and only if C is both J-left- and J-right-bounded.

The following remark is the ﬁrst step towards the deﬁnition of factorization of
morphisms associated with interval decompositions of J.
Remark 3.32 : A nonempty interval in a totally ordered set J is equivalent to the
datum of a pair of upper sets U0 and U1 with U1 ⊆U0, i.e., to the datum of a
strictly monotone morphism of posets [1] −→O(J). Namely, we have seen that
I is equivalent to the datum of an upper set UI and a lower set LI, which are
uniquely determined by I. Let us set U0 = UI and U1 = J \ LI. Then, since O(J)
is totally ordered by Remark 3.3, we have either U0 ⊆U1 or U1 ⊆U0. If U0 ⊆U1
then we have I = U0 ∩LI ⊆UI ∩LI = ∅against the assumption on I. So U1 ⊆U0
and i 7→Ui for i = 0, 1 deﬁnes a monotone map from [1] to O(J). Moreover
this map is strictly monotone since we have excluded the possibility U0 ⊆U1 and
so we can’t have U0 = U1. By removing the assumption that I is nonempty, we
can say that an interval in J is given by a (non necessarily strictly monotone)
morphism of posets [1] −→O(J). Actually this is not completely accurate, since
all constant maps from [1] to O(J) will correspond to the empty interval. Yet
it will be extremely convenient to always think of intervals as monotone maps
to O(J), so we will systematically adopt this point of view in what follows. In
other words we will identify a monotone map I : [1] −→O(J) with the interval
I = U0 ∩L1, where I(0) = (L0, U0) and I(1) = (L1, U1).
Remark 3.33 : If I : [1] −→O(J) is an interval in a totally ordered set J, then
[U0, U1] is an interval in the totally ordered set O(J).
It is easy to see that
intersecting with I deﬁnes a bijection of totally ordered sets
[U0, U1] −→O(I)
U 7→U ∩I.
Lemma 3.34 : Let I : [1] −→O(J) be an interval in J, and let CI be the corre-
sponding subcategory of C, for a given J-slicing. Then the restriction of SU0 to
CL1 and the restriction of RL1 to CU0 both take values in CI.
Proof. We split the proof in two cases. If I = ∅then U0 = U1 and so for any X in
CL1 we have S0X ∼= S1X = 0. So S0|CL1 does take its values in CI = C∅= {0} in
this case. If I ̸= ∅, then U1 ⊆U0. Since S0 takes values in CU0, we only need to
show that it maps CL1 into itself. In other words we want to show that if X ∈CL1
then S0X
∼
−→R1S0X. From the ﬁber sequence
S1S0X
S0X
0
R1S0X
we see we are reduced to showing that S1S0X ∼= 0.
Since U1 ⊆U0, we have
S1S0X ∼= S1X. But, since X ∈CL1 we have S1X ∼= 0. This concludes the proof
in the case I ̸= ∅. The proof for RL1 is completely analogous.
□
By the above lemma and by Lemma 3.21 we can give the following

18
HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
Deﬁnition 3.35 : Let I : [1] −→O(J) be an interval in J, and let t: O(J) −→ts(C)
be a J-slicing on a stable ∞-category C. The functor
HI : C −→CI
is deﬁned as the composition HI = RL1SU0 = SU0RL1.
As for the functors RL and SU we will often implicitly compose HI with the
inclusion CI −→C and look at it as an endofunctor of C. Notice that if I is the
empty interval then HI is the zero functor.
Remark 3.36 : By looking at a lower set L and to an upper set U as intervals, the
above deﬁnition gives HL = RL and HU = SU. In particular we ﬁnd
HI = HU0HL1 = HL1HU0
and, by Lemma 3.21, HI is the coﬁber of the natural transformation HU1 −→HU0.
Remark 3.37 : Let I, ˜I ⊆J two intervals, with I ⊆˜I. Then
HIH
˜I = H
˜IHI = HI.
Namely, if I is empty, then there is nothing to prove.
If I is nonempty, as I
is a sub-interval of ˜I we have U0 ⊆˜U0 and L1 ⊆˜L1.
Therefore (˜L0, ˜U0) ≤
(L0, U0) ≤(L1, U1) ≤(˜L1, ˜U1), and so SU0R˜L1 = R˜L1SU0 by Lemma 3.21 as well
as RL1R˜L1 = RL1 and SU0S ˜U0 = SU0 by Lemma 3.19. Therefore,
HIH
˜I = RL1SU0R˜L1S ˜U0 = RL1R˜L1SU0S ˜U0 = RL1SU0 = HI.
The proof that H˜IHI = HI is similar.
Remark 3.38 : If I and ˜I are two disjoint intervals in the totally ordered set J
then either every element of I is strictly smaller than every element of ˜I or vice
versa. If we are in the ﬁrst case, then CI is right-orthogonal to C˜I, i.e., C(X, Y ) is
contractible whenever X ∈C˜I and Y ∈CI. Namely, by the assumption on I and
˜I we have ˜U0 ⊆U1 and so C˜I ⊆CU1. On the other hand, CI ⊆CL1 and CU1 is
right-orthogonal to CL1 by deﬁnition of t-structure.
Remark 3.39 : If I and ˜I are two disjoint intervals in the totally ordered set J ,
then
HIH
˜I = H
˜IHI = 0.
Indeed, the statement is trivial if either I or ˜I are empty. When they are nonempty,
up to exchanging the role of I and ˜I we may assume that every element of I is
strictly smaller than every element of ˜I . Then we have (L0, U0) ≤(L1, U1) ≤
(˜L0, ˜U0) ≤(˜L1, ˜U1) and so
HIH

by lemma 3.19. Similarly one shows that H˜IHI = 0.
The above Remarks 3.36 and 3.39 are actually two particular instances of the
following general result. The proof is completely analogous to those in the remarks
above, and so it is omitted.

Remark 4.1 : For the whole section (J, ≤) will be a ﬁxed totally ordered Z-poset
and t: O(J) −→ts(C) will be a J-slicing.
Deﬁnition 4.2 : A (k + 2)-fold interval decomposition of J is a morphism of posets
I[k] : [k] −→O(J).
Notation 4.3 : When no ambiguity is possible, the image of j ∈{0, 1, . . ., k} via
I[k] will be denoted simply by (Lj, Uj). For every j = 0, . . . , k + 1 the interval
Ij = Uj−1∩Lj is called the j-th interval in the decomposition, with the convention
that U−1 = J = Lk+1.
The factorization system associated with (Lj, Uj) will be denoted by (Ej, Mj).
Notice that, since I[k] is a morphism of posets we have Ej+1 ⊆Ej and Mj+1 ⊇Mj.
This implies that the composition [k]
I[k]
−−→O(J)
t−→ts(C) is a k-fold factoriza-
tion system; in other words
Lemma 4.4 : Let (Ej, Mj) as above. Then every arrow f : X −→Y in C can be
uniquely factored into a composition

Ek−1∩Mk
−−−−−−→Zk−1 −→. . . −→Z1

Proof. Since (Ek, Mk) is a factorization system, we have a (unique) factorization
X
Ek

Mk
−−→Y . Since (Ek−1, Mk−1) is a factorization system, we can (uniquely)
factor Zk −→Y as Zk
Ek−1
−−−→Zk−1
Mk−1
−−−−→Y . Since Mk−1 ⊆Mk, the morphism
Zk−1 −→Y is also in Mk and so, by the 3-for-2 property, also Zk −→Zk−1 is in
Mk. Therefore Zk
Ek−1
−−−→Zk−1 is in Ek−1 ∩Mk. then one concludes iterating this
argument.
□
Deﬁnition 4.5 : The sequence of morphism in the factorization of f : X −→Y in
Lemma 4.4 is called the I[k]-tower of f, and it is denoted R(f, I[k]), or simply by
R(f) when the interval decomposition I[k] is clear from the context.

Remark 4.6 : When C is the stable ∞-category of spectra and X −→0 and 0 −→X
are the terminal and the initial morphism of X, respectively, the above notation
and construction is in line with the classical Postnikov and Whitehead towers of
X, i.e., with the sequences
X −→. . . −→R2X −→R1X −→R0X −→0
0 −→. . . −→S2X −→S1X −→S0X −→X
of factorizations obtained from the (stable image of) the n-connected factorization
system of [Joy08b].
Remark 4.7 : If both X and Y are in CLk, then the morphism X −→Zk in
R(f, I[k]) is an isomorphism. Indeed, by construction the morphism Zk −→Y is
in Mk. Since both X −→0 and Y −→0 are in Mk then also X −→Y is in Mk
by 3-for-2, and so also X −→Zk in in Mk again by 3-for-2. But by construction
X −→Zk is in Ek, so it is an isomorphism. By the same argument one sees that
if both X and Y are in CU0, then the morphism Z0 −→Y is an isomorphism.
Corollary 4.8 : Let I[k] be a (k + 2)-fold interval decomposition of J. Then for any

Moreover, the arrows fj : HUjY −→HUj−1Y in R(0 −→Y, I[k]) are such that
coﬁb(fj) = HIjY ∈CIj, for j = 0, . . . , k + 1.
Proof. From the (k + 2)-fold factorization

and from the fact that E0 ⊇E1 ⊇· · · ⊇Ek and each class Ej is closed for composi-
tion, we see that 0 −→Yj −→Y is the (Ej, Mj)-factorization of 0 −→Y and so
Yj = SUjY = HUjY . One concludes by Lemma 3.21.
□
The above corollary motivates the following
Deﬁnition 4.9 : Let f : X −→Y be a morphism in C. A I[k]-weaved factorization
for f is a factorization of f of the form

with coﬁb(fj) ∈CIj, for j = 0, . . . , k + 1.
Remark 4.10 : If we call ¢(f, I[k]) the class of I[k]-weaved factorizations for a mor-

morphisms. The remainder of this section is devoted to proving the uniqueness of

21
I[k]-weaved factorizations. This reduces to proving the uniqueness of I[k]-weaved
factorizations for initial morphism, i.e., to showing that the only possible I[k]-
weaved factorization of 0 −→Y is its tower.
Lemma 4.11 : In the above notation, let f : X −→Y be a morphism in C. If X is
in CUj and coﬁb(f) is in CIj then 0 −→X
f−→Y is the (Ej, Mj)-factorization of
the initial morphism 0 −→Y and Y is in CUj−1. In particular f is in Ej−1 ∩Mj.
Proof. Since X is in CUj, the morphism 0 −→X is in Ej, and so to show that
0 −→X
f−→Y is the (Ej, Mj)-factorization of 0 −→Y we are reduced to showing
that f : X −→Y is in Mj. Since coﬁb(f) is in CIj, we have in particular that
coﬁb(f) −→0 is in Mj and so 0 −→coﬁb(f) is in Mj by the Sator lemma. Then
we have a homotopy pullback diagram

and so f is in Mj by the fact that Mj is closed under pullbacks. To show also
that f ∈Ej−1 let X −→T −→Y be the (Ej−1, Mj−1)-factorization of f. Then,
since Ej ⊆Ej−1, 0 −→T −→Y is the (Ej−1, Mj−1)-factorization of 0 −→Y . So,
by the normality of (Ej−1, Mj−1) we get the diagram

fact that coﬁb(f) −→0 is in Mj, that the classes E are closed for pushouts while
the classes M are closed for pullbacks, and the 3-for-2 property for both classes.
Since by hypothesis 0 −→coﬁb(f) is in Ej−1, we see that V = 0 and so T = Y .
Therefore, Y ∈CUj−1 and f ∈Ej−1 ∩Mj.

Remark 4.13 : It’s an unavoidable temptation to think of the I[k]-weaved factoriza-
tion of a morphism f as of its tower R(f, I[k]). As the following counterexample
shows, when f is not an initial morphism this is in general not true. Let J = Z,
let k = 0 and let I[0] : [0] −→O(Z) be the slicing U0 = [0, +∞). Now take a
morphism f : X −→Y between two elements in C−1. The object coﬁb(f) will
lie in C[−1,+∞), since E0[−1] is closed for pushouts, but in general it will not
be an element in C[0,+∞). In other words, we will have, in general, a nontrivial
(E0, M0)-factorization of the initial morphism 0 −→coﬁb(f), i.e., a nontrivial
tower R

. Pulling this back along Y −→coﬁb(f) we obtain the I[0]-
weaved factorization X

−→Y of f, and this factorization will be nontrivial
since its pushout is nontrivial. It follows that (f2, f1), cannot be R(f, I[0]), which
is the (E0, M0)-factorization of f. Indeed, by the 3-for-2 property of M0, the
morphism f is in M0, so its (E0, M0)-factorization is trivial.
Remark 4.14 : Let I[k′] : [k′] −→O(J) be a reﬁnement of an interval decomposition
I[k] : [k] −→O(J). This means that for every i = 0, . . . , k + 1 we have an interval
decomposition I[ki] : [ki] −→O(I[k];i), where I[k];i denotes the i-th interval in the
subdivision I[k]. By the pasting law for pullouts it is immediate to see that for
any morphism f : X −→Y we have a canonical identiﬁcation

4.1. Bridgeland slicings.
Deﬁnition 4.15 : A J-slicing t: O(J) −→ts(C) of a stable ∞-category C is called
discrete if for any object X in C one has Hi(X) = 0 for every i in J if and only if
X = 0. A discrete J-slicing is said to be of ﬁnite type if for any object X one has
Hi(X) ̸= 0 only for ﬁnitely many elements i ∈J.
Example 4.16 : A ﬁnite type discrete Z-slicing on C is precisely the datum of a
bounded t-structure on C.
Suppose now that t is of ﬁnite type, so that for each X ∈C one has Hi(X) = 0
but for a ﬁnite set {iX
1 < · · · < iX
kX} ⊆J of indices i, depending on X. We can
then build up a (k + 2)-fold interval decomposition IX
[kX], depending on the object
X, by setting U X
j
= (ij, +∞). As we are assuming J to be totally ordered, we
have LX
j
= (−∞, ij]. The next proposition shows that the tower of the initial
morphism 0 −→X associated to this interval decomposition is indeed the “ﬁnest
one”.

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
23
Proposition 4.17 : Let t: O(J) −→ts(C) be a J-slicing of ﬁnite type and let X an
object of C. Then for all j we have
HIX
j (X) = HiX
j (X)
and
H(iX
j−1,iX
j )(X) = 0.
Proof. Let us write ij, Ij and Sj for iX
j , IX
j
and SX
Uj, respectively. Now, for each
ϕ ∈J, using By, Prop. 3.40 we have
Hi(H(ij−1,ij)X) =
(
HiX
if i ∈(ij−1, ij)
0
otherwise
.
But HiX = 0 for i ̸= i1, · · · , ikX, and so Hi(H(ij−1,ij)X) = 0 for all i ∈J.
Since t is discrete, this gives H(ij−1,ij)X = 0, proving the second part of the
statement. To prove the ﬁrst part, recall that by Lemma 3.21, HIj(X) is the coﬁber
of SjX −→Sj−1X, while Hij(X) is the coﬁber of SjX −→S[ij,+∞)X. So we are
reduced to show that Sj−1X = S[ij,+∞)X. Since ij > ij−1 we have [ij, +∞) ⊆
(ij−1, +∞) = U X
j−1 and so, by Lemma 3.19, S[ij,+∞)X = S[ij,+∞)Sj−1X. Thus,
we are reduced to show that Sj−1X = S[ij,+∞)Sj−1X, i.e., equivalently, that
R(−∞,ij)Sj−1X = 0. This is immediate as R(−∞,ij)Sj−1X = H(ij−1,ij)X.
□
In particular the above tells us that, writing ϕj for ikX−j, the coﬁber of the
j-th morphism of R(0 −→X, IX
[kX]) is HϕX
j (X) ∈CϕX
j . In other words, these
towers are weaved factorizations with coﬁbers in the subcategories {Cϕ}ϕ∈J and
so they correspond to the Harder-Narasimhan ﬁltrations from [Bri07]. That is,
Bridgeland’s slicings (in their generalized version from [GKR04]) are precisely the
slicings of ﬁnite type in our sense. We show this in detail below.
Deﬁnition 4.18 : A Bridgeland J-slicing on C is a collection {Cϕ}ϕ∈J of full exten-
sion closed sub-∞-subcategories satisfying:
i) Cϕ+1 = Cϕ[1] for each ϕ ∈J;
ii) orthogonality: C(X, Y ) is contractible for each X ∈Cϕ, Y ∈Cψ for ϕ > ψ
in J;
iii) for each object X ∈C there is a ﬁnite set {ϕ1 > · · · > ϕn} and a factor-

Notation 4.19 : For S a subcategory of C, we write ⟨S⟩for the smallest extension
closed full subcategory of C containing S. If M ⊆J is a subset and {Cϕ}ϕ∈J
is a Bridgeland J-slicing on C, we denote CM the extension-closed subcategory
generated by Cϕ with ϕ ∈M, i.e., we set
CM =

ϕ∈M Cϕ

Remark 4.20 : Set ⟨S⟩0 = 0, deﬁne ⟨S⟩1 as the full subcategory of C generated by
S and 0, and deﬁne inductively ⟨S⟩n as the full subcategory of C on those objects

Lemma 4.21 : Let S1, S2 be two subcategories of C with S1  S2, i.e., such that
C(X, Y ) is contractible for any X ∈S1 and any Y ∈S2. Then S1  ⟨S2⟩and
⟨S1⟩ S2, and so ⟨S1⟩ ⟨S2⟩
Proof. By Remark 4.20, to prove the ﬁrst statement we are reduced to show that,
if X ∈S1 and Y ∈⟨S2⟩n then C(X, Y ) is contractible. We prove this by induction
on n. For n = 0, 1 there is nothing to prove by the assumption S1  S2. For
n ≥2, consider a ﬁber sequence Yh −→Y −→Yk with 1 ≤h, k and h + k = n
as in Remark 4.20. Since C(X, −) preserves homotopy ﬁber sequences, we get a
homotopy ﬁber sequence of ∞-groupoids

By the inductive hypothesis both C(X, Yh) and C(X, Yk) are contractible, so C(X, Y )
also is. The proof of the second statement is perfectly dual, due to the fact that in
C every ﬁber sequence is also a coﬁber sequence, and C(−, Y ) transforms a coﬁber
sequence into a ﬁber sequence.

Lemma 4.24 : In the above hypothesis and notation, one has CU[1] ⊆CU and
CL[−1] ⊆CL.
Proof. Since the shift functor commutes with pushouts, if an object X is obtained
by iterated extensions by objects in Cϕ with ϕ ∈U, then X[1] is obtained by
iterated extensions by objects in Cϕ[1] = Cϕ+1 with ϕ ∈U. In other words, X[1]
is an object in CU+1. Since U is an upper set, U + 1 ⊆U and so X[1] ∈CU. This
proves that CU[1] ⊆CU. The proof for CL is perfectly analogous.
□
The above Lemmas together give the following
Proposition 4.25 : In the above hypothesis and notation, the map t: (L, U) 7→
(CL, CU) deﬁnes a J-slicing of C, i.e., t is a Z-equivariant map of posets O(J) −→
ts(C).
Proof. Lemmas 4.22-4.24 together precisely say that (CL, CU) is a t-structure on
C. Equivariancy of the map is the fact that, as remarked in the proof of Lemma
4.24, one has CU[1] = CU+1. Finally, if (L0, U0) ≤(L1, U1) then we have U1 ⊆U0
and so CU1 ⊆CU0, which shows that the map t is a morphism of posets.

Recall the equivalence relation x ∼y if and only if there are integers a, b ∈Z
with a ≤b such that x + a ≤y ≤x + b on a Z-toset J from lemma 2.27.
Lemma 5.1 : The following are equivalent:
i) the Z-toset J consists of a single equivalence class with respect to the
equivalence relation ∼;
ii) there exists an interval I in J such that the map ϕ: (n, x) 7→x + n is an
isomorphism of Z-tosets Z ×lex I
∼
−→J (where the Z-action on I is the
trivial one and the Z-action on Z is the translation).
Proof. That (i) implies (ii) is an immediate consequence of 2.29. To prove the con-
verse implication notice that since ϕ is surjective every element in J is equivalent
to an element in I. So we are reduced to show that all elements in I are equivalent
each other. Let x, y ∈I. We can assume x ≤y. Since J is totally ordered we
have either y ≤x + 1 or x + 1 ≤y. In the latter case we have x ≤x + 1 ≤y and

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
27
so x + 1 ∈I, since I is an interval. But then ϕ(1, x) = ϕ(0, x + 1) against the
hypothesis on ϕ. So we are left with x ≤y ≤x + 1 which implies x ∼y.
□
Deﬁnition 5.2 : Let J be a Z-toset. A heart for J is an interval J ⊆J such that
ϕ: (n, x) 7→x + n is an isomorphism of Z-tosets Z ×lex J
∼
−→J.
Remark 5.3 : Of course, not every Z-toset has a heart. It is easy to see that J has
an heart if and only if there is a morphism of Z-tosets π : J −→Z. An heart of
J is given by π−1
 (0) in this case.
Remark 5.4 : It is immediate from the deﬁnition that J is a heart of J if and only
if J + n is a heart of J, for every n ∈Z.
Example 5.5 : If J = Z, with the standard Z-toset structure, the hearts of J are
the singletons {n} with n ∈Z. In particular {0} is the standard heart of Z, and all
the other hearts are shifts of this. If J = R, with the standard Z-toset structure,
then the hearts of J are the intervals of the form [x, x + 1) and those of the form
(x, x + 1], with x ∈R.
Example 5.6 : Let (J, ≤) be a totally ordered Z-poset, and let ∼be the equivalence
relation from Lemma 2.27. For every i ∈J let Ii be the equivalence class of i. This
is an interval in J, see Example 3.23. Moreover, by Lemma 2.29, Ii has a heart
precisely when i is not a ﬁxed point of the Z-action.
Lemma 5.7 : Let I : [1] −→O(J) be a heart of J. Then I(1) = I(0) + 1, i.e.,
U1 = U0 + 1 (equivalently, L1 = L0 + 1).
Proof. Assume U1 ⊈U0+1. Then there exists an element x in U1∩(L0 +1). Since
I is a heart, there exists an element y in I and an integer n such that x = y + n.
If n ≥1 we have y + n ∈U0 + n ⊆U0 + 1 and so x ∈(U0 + 1) ∩(L0 + 1), which is
impossible. If n ≤0 we have y + n ∈L1 + n ⊆L1 and so x ∈L1 ∩U1 which again
is impossible. Therefore U1 ⊆U0 +1. Now assume U0 +1 ⊈U1. Then there exists
an element x ∈(U0 +1)∩L1. Let y = x−1. Then y ∈U0 ∩(L1 −1) ⊆U0 ∩L1 = I.
Since U0 + 1 ⊆U0 we also have x ∈I, and so ϕ(−1, x) = ϕ(0, y), which is
impossible. Therefore U1 = U0 + 1.

Deﬁnition 5.8 : Let J ⊆J be a heart of J and let t: O(J) −→ts(C) be a J-slicing
on a stable ∞-category C. The subcategory CJ of C will be called a heart of the
J-slicing t and will be denoted C.
Notation 5.9 : We denote the canonical projection to the heart as H : C −→C;
see Def. 3.35.
Example 5.10 : We have seen in Example3.14 that a a Z-slicing on a stable ∞-
category C is the same thing as the datum of a t-structure t = (C<0, C≥0) on
C. The standard heart C = C{0} is called the heart of the t-structure t. The
projection to the heart is the functor H0; see Notation 3.41.
From 4.8 we immediately get the following

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
Proposition 5.11 : Let t = (C<0, C≥0) be a bounded t-structure on a stable ∞-
category C, and let C = C0 be its standard heart. Then t is completely determined
by the functors Hj : C −→C[j] (and so by the functor H0 alone). More precisely,
C≥0 is the full subcategory of C on the objects Y such that HjY = 0 for any j < 0,
while C<0 is the full subcategory of C on those objects Y for which HjY = 0 for
any j ≥0.
Remark 5.12 : There is a rather evocative pictorial representation of the heart
C[0,1) of an R-slicing, manifestly inspired by [Bri07]: if we depict C<0 and C≥0 as
contiguous half-planes (refer to Figure 1) then the action of the shift functor can
be represented as an horizontal shift, and the closure properties of the two classes
C<0, C≥0 under positive and negative shifts are a direct consequence of the shape
of these areas. With these notations, an object Z is in the heart C[0,1) if it lies in
a “boundary region”, i.e. if it lies in C≥0, but Z[−1] lies in C<0.

Let now J ⊆J be a heart, and let C = CI be the corresponding subcategory
of C, relative to a given J-slicing t. Writing I as I : [1] −→O(J), for any n ∈Z and
any k ≥0 we can consider the interval decomposition I[k] : [k] −→O(J) deﬁned
by setting I[k](j) = I(0) + j + n for 0 ≤j ≤k. By Lemma 5.7, this corresponds
to the collection of n contiguous intervals I + n, I + n + 1, . . . , I + n + k −1 ⊆J.
The corresponding subcategories of C will be C[n], C[n + 1],. . . ,C[n + k −1].
The existence and uniqueness of I[k]-weaved factorizations then specializes to
the following statement
Proposition 5.13 : Let f : X −→Y be a morphism in C. Then for any integer n
and any positive integer k there exists a unique factorization

and coﬁb(fn+k) ∈CUk[n] = CU0[k + n].

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES

The content of Prop. 5.13 becomes more interesting when C is bounded with
respect to the J-slicing t (see Def. 3.29), as in this case coﬁb(f) lies in CU0[n]
for n ≪0 and in CL0[n] for n ≫0 . Namely, if C is J-bounded, then coﬁb(f)
lies in C≥i for some i ∈J. Since J is a heart, there exists an element x ∈I
and an integer n0 such that i = x + n0, so that coﬁb(f) ∈C≥x[n0].
As x ∈
I we have x ∈U0 and so [x, +∞) ⊆U0 therefore coﬁb(f) ∈CU0[n0] and so
coﬁb(f) ∈CU0[n] for any n ≤n0. Dually one proves the statement for n ≫0.
As an immediate consequence, by Remark 4.7 we see that in the J-bounded case
if f : X −→Y is any morphism in C, then the morphisms 0 −→coﬁb(f)n+k−1
and coﬁb(f)n −→coﬁb(f) in R


are isomorphisms for n ≪0 and
k ≫0. Since R

is the I[k]-weaved factorization of 0 −→coﬁb(f) by
Corollary 4.8, and since isomorphisms are preserved by pullouts we see that both
X
fn+k
−−−→Zn+k−1 and Zn

−−−→Y are isomorphisms.
This leads to the following
Proposition 5.14 : Let C be a stable ∞-category which is bounded with respect to
a given J-slicing t. Let J ⊆J be a heart for J and let C be the corresponding
heart in C. Then for any morphism f : X −→Y in C there exists an integer n0
and a positive integer k0 such that for any integer n ≤n0 and any positive integer
k with k ≥n0 −n + k0 there exists a unique factorization of f

Remark 5.15 : By uniqueness in Prop. 5.14, one has a well deﬁned Z-factorization
X = lim(Zj) −→· · · −→Zj+1

−−−→Zj−1 −→· · · −→colim(Zj) = Y
with j ranging over the integers, coﬁb(fj) ∈C[j] for any j ∈Z and with fm being
an isomorphism for |j| ≫0. We will refer to this factorization as the C-weaved
factorization of f. Notice how the boundedness of C has played an essential role:
when C is not bounded, one still has towers for interval decomposition I[k] : j 7→
I(0) + j + n for arbitrary k and n, but in general they do not stabilize.
Remark 5.16 : Let J ⊆J be a heart, and let (L, U) be the slicing J(0) of J and
t = (CU, CL) be the corresponding t-structure on C. By Lemma 5.7 the standard
heart of t is precisely C. Moreover, by Corollaries 4.8 and 4.12, the C-weaved
factorization
0 = lim(Yj) −→· · · −→Yj+1

−−−→Yj−1 −→· · · −→colim(Yj) = Y
of an initial morphism 0 −→Y is such that coﬁb(fj) = HjY for any j ∈Z. There-
fore we see that the t-structure (CL, CU) can be completely read from C-weaved
factorizations: an object Y is in CU if and only if the C-weaved factorization
of 0 −→Y satisﬁes coﬁb(fj) = 0 for any j < 0, while Y is in CL if and only if
coﬁb(fj) = 0 for any j ≥0. We are going to use this fact later to characterize
hearts of t-structures among full subcategories of C.

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
Remark 5.17 : The content of Remark 5.16 can be elegantly expressed in terms of
the functoriality of slicings (Remark 3.12). Namely, by Remark 5.3, to give a heart
J of J is equivalent to giving a Z-equivariant morphism of π : Z-tosets J −→Z,
and by functoriality this induces a map
π : 切(J, C) −→ts(C).
The heart C of a J-slicing t on C is then the standard heart of the corresponding
t-structure π(t). Moreover, one easily sees that t is a bounded J-slicing if and
only if π(t) is a bounded t-structure. Indeed, since π is a morphism of tosets,
for any i1 ≤i2 in J we have [i1, i2] ⊆π−1
 [π(i1), π(i2)]. Vice versa, since π is
Z-equivariant, for every j ∈J we have π(j + n) = π(j) + n and so for every
n1 ≤n2 in Z there exist j1 ≤j2 in J such that π(j1) < n1 and π(j2) > n2. Let
j ∈J be such n1 ≤π(j) ≤n2. If j > j2 then we would have π(j) ≥π(j2) > n2,
and so j ≤j2. Similarly j ≥j1 and so π−1
 [n1, n2] ⊆[j1, j2].
5.1. Abelianity of the heart. In the following section we present a proof of
the fact that a heart C of a J-slicing on a stable ∞-category C is an abelian
∞-category.
In other words, C is homotopy equivalent to its homotopy category hC, which
is an abelian category; this is the higher-categorical counterpart of a classical result,
ﬁrst proved in [BBD82, Thm. 1.3.6], which only relies on properties stated in terms
of normal torsion theories in a stable ∞-category.
We begin with the following
Deﬁnition 5.18 [Additive ∞-category]: An additive ∞-category is an additive
category regarded as an ∞-category.
Remark 5.19 : Equivalently, an additive ∞-category is a quasicategory A such that
i) the hom space A(X, Y ) is a homotopically discrete inﬁnite loop space for
any X, Y , i.e., there exists an inﬁnite sequence of ∞-groupoids Ξ0, Ξ1, Ξ2, . . . ,
with Ξ0 ∼= C(X, Y ) and homotopy equivalences Ξi ∼= ΩΞi+1 for any i ≥0,
such that πnΞ0 = 0 for any n ≥1;
ii) A has a zero object, and (homotopy) biproducts.
Remark 5.20 : If A is a full additive ∞-subcategory of a stable ∞-category C, then
A[n1]  A[n2] for any n1 > n2. Namely, for an additive A, let X ∈A[n1] and
Y ∈A[n2]. Then X = Z1[n1] and Y = Z2[n2] for suitable Z1, Z2 ∈A and so
C(X, Y ) = C(Z1[n1], Z2[n2]) ∼= C(Z1, Z2[n2 −n1])
∼= Ωn1−n2C(Z1, Z2) = Ωn1−n2A(Z1, Z2),
where in the last equality we used the fact that A is full. Since n1 −n2 > 0, the
space Ωn1−n2A(Z1, Z2) is contractible by deﬁnition of additive ∞-category.
Remark 5.21 : In the triangulated setting one does not have the compatibility
between the looping operation on objects and on spaces of morphisms ΩC(X, Y ) =
C(X, ΩY ) and so the othogonality condition A[n1]  A[n2] for n1 > n2, when
needed, has to be imposed by hands. This is nothing but the usual vanishing of

negative Ext’s one frequently meets as a property of ‘good’ additive subcategories
of a triangulated category.
Deﬁnition 5.22 [Abelian ∞-category]: An abelian ∞-category is an abelian cat-
egory regarded as an ∞-category.
Remark 5.23 : Equivalently, an abelian ∞-category is an additive ∞-category A
such that
i) A has (homotopy) kernels and cokernels;
ii) for any morphism f in A, the natural morphism from the coimage of f to
the image (see Def. 5.31) of f is an equivalence.
The rest of the section is devoted to the proof of the following result:
Theorem 5.24 : Let C be a heart of a J-slicing t on a stable ∞-category C. Then
C is an abelian ∞-category.
Remark 5.25 : If J = Z, so that t is the datum of a t-structure on C, and C = C{0}
is the standard heart of C, the the homotopy category hC is the abelian category
arising as the standard heart of the t-structure h(t) on the triangulated category
hC.
In what follows, let I : [1] −→O(J) be an interval such that C = CI. The two
factorization systems associated with I will be denoted by (E0, M0) and (E1, M1),
respectively. By Lemma 5.7 we have M1 = M0[1] and E1 = E0[1].
Lemma 5.26 : For any X and Y in C, the hom space C(X, Y ) is a homotopically
discrete inﬁnite loop space.
Proof. Since C is a full subcategory of C, we have C(X, Y ) = C(X, Y ), which is
an inﬁnite loop space since C is a stable ∞-category.
So we are left to prove that πnC(X, Y ) = 0 for n ≥1. Since πnC(X, Y ) =
πn−1ΩC(X, Y ) = πn−1C(X, Y [−1]), this is equivalent to showing that C(X, Y [−1])
is contractible. Since X and Y are objects in C, we have X ∈CU0 and Y [−1] ∈
CL1[−1] = CL1−1 = CL0.
But CL0 is right object-orthogonal to CU0, therefore
C(X, Y [−1]) is contractible.
□
The subcategory C inherits the 0 object and biproducts (in fact, all ﬁnite
limits) from C, so in order to prove it is is abelian we are left to prove that it has
kernels and cokernels, and that the canonical morphism from the coimage to the
image is an equivalence.
Lemma 5.27 : Let f : X −→Y be a morphism in C. Then ﬁb(f) is in CL1 and
coﬁb(f) is in CU0.
Proof. Since both X −→0 and Y −→0 are in M1, by the 3-for-2 property also f
is in M1. Since M1 is closed for pullbacks, ﬁb(f) −→0 is in M1 and so ﬁb(f) is
in CL1. The proof for coﬁb(f) is completely dual.

M1 / 0
the (E1, M1)-factorization of the morphism coﬁb(f) −→0. We call ker(f) and
coker(f) respectively the kernel and the cokernel of f in C.
Remark 5.29 : Since coﬁb(f)[−1] ∼= ﬁb f and (M1, E1)[−1] = (M0, E0), one can
equivalently deﬁne coker(f) by declaring the (E0, M0)-factorization of ﬁb(f) −→0
to be ﬁb(f)

Lemma 5.30 : Both ker(f) and coker(f) are in C.
Proof. By construction ker(f) is in CU0, so we only need to show that ker(f) is
in CL1. By deﬁnition of ker(f), we have that ker(f) −→ﬁb(f) is in M0. Since
M0[−1] ⊆M0, we have that also ker(f)[−1] −→ﬁb(f)[−1] is in M0. By Lemma
5.27, ﬁb(f)[−1] −→0 is in M1[−1] = M0 and so we ﬁnd that also ker(f)[−1] −→0
is in M0. The proof for coker(f) is perfectly dual.

By deﬁnition of ker(f) and coker(f), the deﬁning diagram of ﬁb(f) and coﬁb(f)

The following lemma shows that ker(f) does indeed have the deﬁning property

given diagram is a pullout in C. This means that X = ker(g) and Z = coker(f).

ﬁb(g) −→0 is in E0 and so X −→ﬁb(g) is an isomorphism. Therefore the given

Next, paste on the left of this diagram the pullout given by Remark 5.29 and
build the rest of the diagram by taking pullbacks or pushouts, recalling that
(E0, M0)[1] = (E1, M1). Use again Remark 5.29 and the fact that M1 is closed

5.2. Abelian subcategories as hearts. By the results in the previous section
and by Corollary 5.11 we see that hearts of bounded t-structures are very peculiar
subcategories of a stable ∞-category C: they are abelian and every morphism in
C admits a unique C-weaved factorization. As we are going to show, these two
properties precisely characterize hearts among full subcategories of C.
Deﬁnition 5.37 : Let f : X −→Y be a morphism in C, and let A be an additive
∞-subcategory of C. An A-weaved factorization of f is a factorization

Proposition 5.38 : Let A be an additive full ∞-subcategory of a stable ∞-category
C such that any morphism f : X −→Y in C has an A-weaved factorization. Then
the collection of subcategories {A[n]}n∈Z is a Bridgeland Z-slicing of C.
Proof. Looking at Def. 4.18, the only thing we need to prove is that A[n1]  A[n2]
for n1 > n2. This is Remark 5.20.
□
From Proposition 4.26 and Remark 4.27 we then immediately have the following
converse of Corollary 5.11, corresponding to [Bri07, Lemma 3.2].
Proposition 5.39 : Let A be a full additive ∞-subcategory of a stable ∞-category C,
such that any morphism in C has a A-weaved factorization, and let Hn
B : C −→A[n]
be the functors given by taking the coﬁbers of the n-th morphism in the A-weaved
factorization of the initial morphisms. Let CA,≥0 be the full subcategory of C on
those objects X such that Hj
B(X) = 0 for any j < 0, and let CA,<0 be the full
subcategory of C on those objects X such that Hj
B(X) = 0 for any j ≥0. Then
tA = (CA,≥0, CA,<0) is a t-structure on C, the stable ∞-category C is bounded
with respect to tA, and the standard heart of tA is (equivalent to) A. In particular
A is abelian.
Proof. The only thing left to prove is that the standard heart of tA is A. To see
this notice that an object Y lies in C = CA,≥0 ∩CA,<1 if and only if the A-weaved

6. Semi-orthogonal decompositions.
La vie c’est ce qui se décompose à tout moment; c’est une perte monotone de
lumière, une dissolution insipide dans la nuit, sans sceptres, sans auréoles, sans
nimbes.
E. Cioran
In the previous section we have investigated the case when the equivalence
relation ∼from Lemma 2.27 had a single equivalence class. At the opposite end is
the case when each equivalence class consists of a single element. As x ∼x + 1 for
any x ∈J, this is equivalent to requiring that the Z-action is trivial. As noticed in
Remark 2.18 this in particular happens when J is a ﬁnite ﬁnite totally ordered set.
As we are going to show, this is another well investigated case in the literature:
J-families of t-structures with a ﬁnite J capture the notion of semi-orthogonal
decompositions for the stable ∞-category C (see [BO95,Kuz11] for the notion of
semi-orthogonal decomposition in the classical triangulated context).
To ﬁx notations for this section, let J = [k] be the totally ordered set on (k +1)
elements, i.e., J = {0, 1, . . ., k}, and let t: O([k]) −→ts(C) be a [k]-slicing on C.

for i = 0, . . . , k. This corresponds to the morphism of posets [k −1] −→O([k])

What we are left to investigate are therefore the special features of the t-
structures ti = (C<i, C≥i) coming from the triviality of the Z-action on [k], and
so on O([k]). By Z-equivariancy of the map t: O([k]) −→ts(C), this implies that
all the t-structures ti are Z-ﬁxed points for the natural Z-action on ts(C). Now,
a rather pleasant fact is that ﬁxed points of the Z-action on ts(C) are precisely
those t-structures (L, U) for which U is a stable sub-∞-category of C. We will
make use of the following
Lemma 6.1 : Let B be a full sub-∞-category of the stable ∞-category C; then,
B is a stable sub-∞-category of C if and only if B is closed under shifts in both
directions and under pushouts in C.
Proof. The “only if” part is trivial, so let us prove the “if” part. First of all let
us see that under these assumptions B is closed under taking ﬁbers of morphisms.
This is immediate: if f : X −→Y is an arrow in B (i.e. an arrow of C between
objects of B, by fullness), then f[−1] is again in B since B is closed with respect to
the left shift. Since B is closed under pushouts in C, also ﬁb(f) = coﬁb(f[−1]) is
in B. It remains to show how this implies that B is actually stable, i.e. it is closed
under all ﬁnite limits and satisﬁes the pullout axiom. Unwinding the assumptions
on B, this boils down to showing that in the square

the pullback B of f, g ∈hom(B) done in C is actually an object of B; indeed, once
this is shown, the square above will satisfy the pullout axiom in C, so a fortiori it
will have the universal property of a pushout in B. To this aim, let us consider
the enlarged diagram of pullout squares in C

The objects Z[−1], ﬁb(f) and ﬁb(g) lie in B by the ﬁrst part of the proof, so the
square (⋆) is in particular a pushout of morphism in B; by assumption, this entails
that B ∈B.
□
Remark 6.2 : Obviously, a completely dual statement can be proved in a completely
dual fashion: a full sub-∞-category B of a stable ∞-category C is a stable sub-
∞-category if and only if it is closed under shifts in both directions and under
pullbacks in C.
Proposition 6.3 : Let t = (L, U) be a t-structure on a stable ∞-category C, and let
(E, M) be the normal torsion theory associated to t; then the following conditions
are equivalent:
(1) t is a ﬁxed point for the Z-action on ts(C), i.e., t[1] = t (or equivalently,
L[1] = L, or equivalently U[1] = U);
(2) U is a stable sub-∞-category of C.
(3) L is a stable sub-∞-category of C.
(4) E is closed under pullback;
(5) M is closed under pushout.
Proof. ‘(2) implies (1)’ is obvious. Namely, if U is a stable sub-∞-category of C,
then it is closed under shifts in both directions. Therefore U[−1] ⊆U, and so
U ⊆U[1]. Since, by deﬁnition of t-structure, U[1] ⊆U, we have U[1] = U. To
prove that ‘(1) implies (2)’, assume U[1] = U. This implies U[−1] = U, so U is
closed under shifts in both directions. By Lemma 6.1, we then have only to show
that U is closed under pushouts in C to conclude that U is a stable ∞-subcategory
of C. Consider a pushout diagram

in C with A, B and C in U. Since A and C are in U = 0/E we have that both
0 −→A and 0 −→C are in E. But E has the 3-for-2 property, so also A −→C
is E. Since E is closed for pushouts, this implies that also B −→P is in E. But
0 −→B in in E since B is in U, and therefore also 0 −→P is in E, i.e., P is in U.
We now prove that ‘(1) is equivalent to (4)’. Assume E is closed under pullbacks.
Then for any X in U we have that 0 −→X is in E, and so X[−1] −→0 is in E.
By the Sator lemma this implies that 0 −→X[−1] is in E, i.e., that X[−1] is in
U. This shows that U[−1] ⊆U and therefore that t[1] = t. Conversely, assume
t[1] = t, and consider a morphism f : X −→Y in E. For any morphism B −→Y
in C consider the diagram

where all the squares are pullouts in C. Since f is in E and E is closed for pushouts,
also 0 −→coﬁb(f) is in E. This means that coﬁb(f) is in U and so, since we are
assuming that U = U[−1], also ﬁb(f) = coﬁb(f)[−1] is in U, i.e., 0 −→ﬁb(f) is in
E. By the Sator lemma, ﬁb(f) −→0 is in E, which is closed for pushouts, and so
A −→B is in E. The proofs that ‘(1) if and only if (3)’ and ‘(1) if and only if (5)’
are perfectly dual.
□
Remark 6.4 : A factorization system (E, M) for which the class E is closed for
pullbacks is sometimes called an exact reﬂective factorization, see, e.g., [CHK85].
This is equivalent to saying that the associated reﬂection functor is left exact
(this is called a localization in the jargon of [CHK85]). Dually, one characterizes
co-localizations of a category C with an initial object as co-exact coreﬂective fac-
torizations where the right class M is closed under pushouts. Therefore, in the
stable ∞-case, we see that a Z-ﬁxed point in ts(C) is a t-structure (L, U) such
that the truncation functors S : C −→U and R: C −→L respectively form a co-
localizations and a localization of C. In the terminology of [BR07] we therefore ﬁnd
that in the stable ∞-case Z-ﬁxed point in ts(C) correspond to hereditary torsion
pairs on C. Since we have seen that for a Z-ﬁxed point in ts(C) both L and U are
stable ∞-categories, this result could be deduced also from [Lur17, Prop. 1.1.4.1]:
a left (resp., right) exact functor between stable ∞-categories is also right (resp.,
left) exact.
We can now precisely relate semi-orthogonal decompositions in a stable ∞-
category C to [k]-slicings of C. The only thing we still need is the following def-
inition, which is an immediate adaptation to the stable setting of the classical
deﬁnition given for triangulated categories (see, e.g., [BO95,Kuz11] ).
Deﬁnition 6.5 : Let C be a stable ∞-category. A semi-orthogonal decomposition
with k + 1 classes on C is the datum of k + 1 stable ∞-subcategories C0, C1,. . . ,
Ck of C such that
(1) one has Ci  Ch for h < i (semi-orthogonality);
(2) for any object Y in C there exists a unique {Ci}-weaved tower, i.e., a
factorization of the initial morphism 0 −→Y as

Since {Ci}-weaved towers are preserved by pullouts, one can equivalently require
that any morphism f : X −→Y in C has a unique factorization of has a unique

Proposition 6.6 : Let C be a stable ∞-category.
Then the datum of a semi-
orthogonal decompositions with k + 1 classes on C is equivalent to the datum
of a [k]-slicing on C.

40
HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
Proof. The only missing piece of information to show that a [k]-slicing is a semi-
orthogonal decompositions is the fact that the sub-∞-categories Ci are stable. But
Ci = Li+1 ∩Ui and both Li+1 and Ui are stable by Prop. 6.3. Therefore, also
Ci is stable (see [Lur17]). Conversely, given a semi-orthogonal decomposition this
deﬁnes a [k]-slicing by means of the coﬁber functors Hi
B : C −→Ci, by the same
argument in the proof of Prop. 5.39.
□
Remark 6.7 : By Remark 6.4, we recover in the stable ∞-setting the well known
fact (see [BR07, IV.4]) that semi-orthogonal decompositions with a single class
correspond to hereditary torsion pairs on the category.
Prop. 6.6 immediately suggests to generalize the deﬁnition of semi-orthogonal
decomposition to the case of an arbitrary toset of indices, not necessarily ﬁnite.
Deﬁnition 6.8 : Let I be a toset, and let I♭be the Z-toset given by I endowed
with the trivial Z-action (see 2.30).
An I♭-slicing of a stable ∞-category C is
called a I-semi-orthogonal decomposition of C. The class of all I-semi-orthogonal
decompositions of C will be denoted by I-sod(C), i.e. I-sod(C) = 切(I♭, C).
Remark 6.9 : If an I-semi-orthogonal decomposition of C is given, then all the
subcategories Ci are stable, for any i in I.
Remark 6.10 : Let J be a Z-toset, and let ι(J) be the toset of equivalence classes of
J, for the equivalence relation ∼of Lemma 2.27. Then every J-slicing of a stable ∞-
category C induces an ι(J)-semi-orthogonal decomposition of C. Namely, by Prop.
2.30, J ⇝ι(J) is the left adjoint of the fully faithful embedding (
)♭: Tos −→
Z-Tos, and the the projection to the quotient is a Z-equivariant morphism
J −→ι(J)♭
which is the unit of this adjunction. By functoriality of the slicings (Remark 3.12)
we therefore have a natural map
切(J, C) −→ι(J)-sod(C).
7. Abelian slicings and tiltings
Quando si vuole uccidere un uomo bisogna colpirlo al cuore, e un Winchester è
l’arma più adatta.
R. Rojo
We now review the abelian counterpart of the notion of J-slicing and relate
slicings on hearts of a stable ∞-category C with slicings of C. First of all recall the
notion of torsion pair on an abelian ∞-category, which is the abelian counterpart
of the notion of t-structure on a stable ∞-category.
Deﬁnition 7.1 [torsion theory on an abelian ∞-category]: Let A be an
abelian ∞-category. A torsion pair on an abelian ∞-category A is a pair (F, T) of
full sub-∞-subcategories of A satisfying:
i) orthogonality: A(X, Y ) is contractible for each X ∈T, Y ∈F;

ii) any object X ∈A ﬁts into a pullout diagram

with XT ∈T and XF ∈F.
The subcategories T and F are called the torsion class and the torsion free class,
respectively.
Notation 7.2 : We denote by tt(A) the set of torsion theories on A; this set has
a natural choice for a partial order: (F1, T1) ≤(F2, T2) if and only if T2 ⊆T1, or
equivalently F1 ⊆F2.
The poset tt(A) has a top and a bottom element, given by (A, 0) and (0, A),
respectively. The following deﬁnition is directly inspired by [Rud97].
Deﬁnition 7.3 [abelian slicing]: Let (I, ≤) be a poset. An abelian I-slicing on
A is a morphism of posets T : O(I) −→tt(A) that preserve the top and bottom
element. The image of (Λ, Υ) ∈O(I) by T will be denoted (AΛ, AΥ)
Remark 7.4 : Notice that, since there is no choice of a shift functor in an abelian
∞-category, there is no Z-action on I or Z-equivariancy condition involved in the
above deﬁnition.
Remark 7.5 [The abelian slicings functor]: By analogy with Remark 3.12,
for any ∞-category A we have a functor 切ab : Pos −→Pos mapping a poset I to
the poset of abelian I-slicings of A.
Lemma 7.6 : Let t0 = (L0, U0) be a t-structure on C with heart C, and let t1 = t0[1].
Also let t = (L, U) be another t-structure with t0 ≤t ≤t1. Then
T = (F, T) := (L ∩C, U ∩C)
is a torsion theory on C.
Proof. Clearly, F ⊆C and T ⊆C. Moreover, F ⊆L and T ⊆U, and so T  F.
Now, pick X ∈C and consider the ﬁber sequence

We have XL[−1] ∈L[−1] ⊆L ⊆L1 and X ∈C ⊆L1.
Since L1 is closed
by extensions (see Remark 3.18), this implies that XU ∈L1. Therefore XU ∈
L1 ∩U = L1 ∩U0 ∩U = T. An analogous argument shows that XL ∈F.
□
Proposition 7.7 : Let (J, ≤) be a Z-toset, and let J a heart of J. Then a J-slicing
on C induces a t-structure on C together with an abelian J-slicing on C.
Proof. Let O(J) −→ts(C) be a ﬁxed J-slicing on C, and let J = U0∩L1 for some
(unique) upper set U0 and lower set L1 in J. Finally, let t0 be the t-structure on C
corresponding to the slicing (L0, U0) of J. Then we know from Remark 5.15 that
C = CJ is the standard heart of t0. Let t1 be the t-structure on C corresponding
to the slicing (L1, U1) of J. By Lemma 5.7 we know that t1 = t0[1]. Moreover we
know from Remark 3.33 that every upper set Υ of J is of the form Υ = U ∩J
for a unique upper set U in J with U0 ≤U ≤U1. Let (L, U) be the slicing of J
determined by U. By Lemma 7.6,
(Λ, Υ) 7→(CL ∩C, CU ∩C)
deﬁnes an abelian J-slicing on C.
□
As we are going to show, in the bounded case we also have the converse of the
above proposition.
Lemma 7.8 : Suppose that t is a bounded t-structure on C with heart C. Then a
torsion theory T = (F, T) on C induces a bounded Z ×lex [1]-slicing on C.
Proof. Since every interval of the form [n0, n1] in Z ×lex [1] is ﬁnite, a bounded
Z ×lex [1]-slicing is discrete of ﬁnite type. Therefore, by Prop. 4.26 we are reduced
to showing that a torsion theory T on C induces a Bridgeland Z ×lex [1]-slicing
on C. Since T = (F, T) is a torsion theory of C, we have that T [n] = (F[n], T[n])
is a torsion theory of C[n] for any n ∈Z. Consider the full subcategories
C(n,0) = F[n];
C(n,1) = T[n].
Since the Z-action on Z ×lex [1] is (n, i) + 1 = (n + 1, i), it is immediate to see
that C(n,i)+1 = C(n,i)[1] for every (n, i) in Z ×lex [1]. Let now X ∈C(n1,i1) and
Y ∈C(n2,i2) with (n1, i1) > (n2, i2). Since the order is the lexicographic one, we
either have n1 > n2 or n1 = n2 and i1 = 1 and i2 = 0. In the ﬁrst case X ∈C[n1]
and Y ∈C[n2] with n1 > n2 and so X  Y ; in the second case X ∈T[n1] and
Y ∈F[n1] and so again X Y . Finally, we have to show that for every object X of
C we have a factorization of the initial morphism 0 −→X into morphisms whose
coﬁbers are in Cn,i for a decreasing sequence of indices (n, i)’s in the lexicographic
order on Z × [1]. To see this, let X be an object in C and consider the C-weaved
tower of its initial morphism. Keeping only the nontrivial morphisms in this tower
we are reduced to a ﬁnite factorization of the form
0 = X0

Remark 7.9 : The nontrivial upper sets in Z ×lex [1] are easily described: they are
all of the form [(n, i), +∞) for some n ∈Z and i ∈[1]. In the notation of Lemma
7.8, the t-structures on C corresponding to these upper sets are easily described
by means of Remark 4.27. We have
(C  T )≥(n,0) = C≥n = {X ∈C | HiX = 0 for i < n}
(C  T )≥(n,1) = {X ∈C | HiX = 0 for i < n, (HnX)F[n] = 0}
Equivalently,
(C  T )≥(n,1) = {X ∈C | HiX = 0 for i < n, HnX ∈T[n]}
Deﬁnition 7.10 : Let t = (C<0, C≥0) be a bounded t-structure on C and let C be
its standard heart. For every torsion theory T on C, the t-structure t  T =

(C  T )<(0,1), (C  T )≥(0,1)

is said to be obtained tilting (it’s a verb) (C<0, C≥0)
with T (see [BR07]).
Remark 7.11 : One immediately sees that the tilting of a t-structure t = (C<0, C≥0)
by the bottom torsion theory T⊥= (0, C) is the trivial tilting, while tilting by
the the top torsion theory T⊤= (C, 0) correspond to shifting by 1:
• t  T⊥= (C<0, C≥0),
• t  T ⊤= (C<1, C≥1) = (C<0, C≥0)[1].

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
Remark 7.12 : The construction of Lemma 7.8 gives a map
tt(C) −→切(Z ×lex [1], C),
and the explicit description in Remark 7.9 show that this is a morphism of posets.
Namely, if T1 ≤T2 then T2[n] ⊆T1[n] and so (C  T2)≥(n,i) ⊆(C  T1)≥(n,i) for
every (n, i). In particular, tilting deﬁnes a morphism of posets
(
 
): tt(C) × ts(C) −→ts(C).
This construction can be seen as a byproduct of the functoriality of slicings as
follows. The Z-toset Z ×lex [1] has an obvious Z-equivariant morphism of posets
to Z given by the projection π on the ﬁrst factor. However, and remarkably, there
is also another less trivial Z-equivariant morphism
π ◦tilt: Z ×lex [1] −→Z
given by the composition of the projection π with the Z-equivariant automorphism
of the poset Z ×lex [1] deﬁned by
(
tilt(n, 0) = (n −1, 1)
tilt(n, 1) = (n, 0)
.
Since taking slicings of a ﬁxed stable ∞-category with respect to a Z-toset J is
functorial in J (Remark 3.12), we have a morphism of Z-tosets
切(Z ×lex [1], C)
π◦tilt
−−−→ts(C).
Composing this with the morphism of posets tt(C) −→切(Z ×lex [1], C) gives
the tilting map.
The proposition below can be found in [BR07] for J = Z ×lex [1] and in [Bri07]
for J = R.
Proposition 7.13 : Let J be a Z-toset, and let J be a heart of J. Then giving a
bounded J-slicing on C is equivalent to giving a bounded t-structure (C<0, C≥0)
on C together with an abelian J-slicing on the standard heart C of (C<0, C≥0).
Moreover the bounded J-slicing on C is discrete if and only if the abelian J-slicing
of C is discrete.
Proof. In one direction this is the content of Prop. 7.7. Vice versa, assume we
have a bounded t-structure (C<0, C≥0) on C and an abelian J-slicing T on its
standard heart C. By deﬁnition this is a morphism of posets O(J) −→tt(C).
By Remark 7.12, tilting a ﬁxed t-structure gives a morphism of posets tt(C) −→
ts(C), and so by composition we get a morphism of posets
O(J) −→ts(C)
Recalling the identiﬁcation of O(J) with the interval [U0, U1] of O(J) from Re-
mark 3.33, and that U1 = U0 + 1 from Lemma 5.7, this is a morphism of posets
[U0, U0 + 1] −→ts(C) and so it induces a uniquely determined Z-equivariant mor-
phism of Z-tosets
t: Z ×lex [U0, U0 + 1] −→ts(C)

HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
45
By Remark 7.11, t(1,U0) = t(0,U0)[1] = t(0,U0+1) and so t factors through the natural
morphism of Z-tosets
Z ×lex [U0, U0 + 1] −→O(J)
given by (n, U) 7→U + n. In other words, t uniquely deﬁnes a J-slicing on C,
which is bounded since the t-structure (C<0, C≥0) is, by Remark 5.17. Finally, the
construction manifestly preserves ﬁnite types.
□
8. Concluding remarks
That’s all, folks!
Bosko
We have explored two classes of J-slicings so far: those for which J has a heart,
and those for which Z acts trivially on J. In this section, we show how these two
cases are fundamental building blocks for all other J-slicings.
Lemma 8.1 : Let t be a J-slicing on a stable ∞-category C, and let Ii ⊆J be the
equivalence class of i ∈J with respect to the equivalence relation ∼of Lemma
2.27. For every (Λ, Υ) = (L ∩Ii, U ∩Ii) in O(Ii), let ti;Λ,Υ = (CL ∩CIi, CU ∩CIi).
Then ti : (Λ, Υ) −→ti;Λ,Υ is a Ii-slicing of CIi.
Proof. By Remark 6.10, the J-slicing t induces an ι(J)-semi-orthogonal decompo-
sition of C: for every equivalence class [i] in ι(J) the corresponding slice in this
semi-orthogonal decomposition is the subcategory CIi of C determined by the J-
slicing t, where Ii ⊆J is the equivalence class of i with respect to the equivalence
reltion ∼, as a subset of J. As they are the slices of a semi-orthogonal decom-
position, the subcategories CIi are stable (this can also be seen directly from the
deﬁnition of the CIi’s). As shown in Example 3.23, Ii is an interval of J and a sub-
Z-toset of J, simply by deﬁnition of the equivalence relation. For every i, we can
therefore write Ii = Ui;0 ∩Li;1. By Remark 3.33 every slicing (Λ, Υ) of Ii is of the
form Λ = L∩Ii and Υ = U ∩Ii for a unique slicing (L, U) of J with Ui;0 ≤U ≤Ui;1.
This gives an isomorphism of tosets between O(Ii) and the interval [Ui;0, Ui;1] in
O(J). Now, to show that ti;Λ,Υ is a t-structure on CIi one verbatim repeats the
proof of Lemma 7.6 to get orthogonality of the classes and the existence of the
relevant ﬁber sequences. Next, to show that (CU ∩CIi)[1] ⊆CU ∩CIi notice that,
since Ii is an equivalence class, we have Ii + 1 = Ii and so
(U ∩Ii) + 1 = (U + 1) ∩(Ii + 1) ⊆U ∩Ii.
This shows that ti is a morphism of sets O(Ii) −→ts(CIi) and it is immediate to
see that this is actually a morphism of tosets. Finally, Z equivariance is obtained
by noticing that Υ + 1 = (U ∩Ii) + 1 = (U + 1) ∩Ii and Λ + 1 = (L + 1) ∩Ii, so
that
ti;Λ+1,Υ+1 = (CL+1 ∩CIi, CU+1 ∩CIi) = (CL[1] ∩CIi, CU[1] ∩CIi) = ti;Λ,Υ[1],
where we used that CIi is a stable subcategory of C and so CIi = CIi[1].
□
We can now state and prove our main result, summarising and putting together
the various pieces constructed so far.
To make a self-standing statement, we

46
HEARTS AND TOWERS IN STABLE ∞-CATEGORIES
explicitly recall the deﬁnition of the equivalence relation ∼from Lemma 2.27 in
the statement of the theorem below.
Theorem 8.2 : Let (J, ≤) a Z-toset. A ﬁnite type J-slicing on a stable ∞-category
C is equivalent to the following data:
(i) a ﬁnite type semi-orthogonal decomposition of C whose slices C[x] are stable
∞-subcategories of C indexed by equivalence classes in J with respect to
the equivalence relation x ∼y if and only if there exist integers n1 and n2
with x + n1 ≤y ≤x + n2;
(ii) a bounded t-structure t[x] on C[x] for each [x] in J/∼;
(iii) a ﬁnite type abelian [x, x + 1)-slicing on C
[x] for every [x] in J/∼such that
x is not a ﬁxed point of the Z-action on J.
Proof. By Lemma 8.1, a J-slicing on a stable ∞-category induces semi-orthogonal
decomposition of C whose slices CIi are stable ∞-subcategories of C indexed by
equivalence classes Ii in J with respect to the equivalence relation ∼, together
with Ii-slicings of these subcategories. If i is a ﬁxed point for the Z-action on J,
then Ii = {i} and O(Ii) = [1] so that a Ij-slicing is trivial. On the other hand, by
Example 5.6, precisely when i is not a ﬁxed point of the Z-action the interval Ii
has a heart I
i which can be identiﬁed with the interval [i, i+1) of J. Therefore, by
Prop. 7.7 an Ii-slicing on CIi induces a t-structure on CIi together with an abelian
[i, i + 1)-slicing on the standard heart C
Ii. Moreover, by Prop. 7.13, in the ﬁnite
type case an Ii-slicing on CIi is precisely equivalent to this datum of a bounded
t-structure on CIi with an abelian I
i -slicing on C
Ii.
Vice versa, given the data (i)-(iii), we want to deﬁne a J-slicing of C. For every
upper set U of J, we can write
U =
[
[i]∈J/∼
U ∩Ii
and, by Prop. 7.13 again, the data (i)-(iii) deﬁne ∞-subcategories CU∩Ii ⊆C[i]
of C. Deﬁning CU as the extension closed ∞-subcategory of C generated by the
CU∩Ii’s provides a map t: O(J) −→ts(C) which is immediate to see it is montone
and Z-equivariant and so is a J-slicing of C. Moreover, this J-slicing is of ﬁnite
type as all the slicings provided by the data are of ﬁnite type, and manifestly this
way of constructing ﬁnite type J-slicings out of data (i)-(iii) provides an inverse
to the construction described in the ﬁrst part of the proof.

§2.) These are the ﬁrst three verses of Tao te Ching’s chapter 63: “Act without action /
work without work / taste without taste.”
§3.) This is a quote from Histoire d’O: “her freedom was worse than any chain.”
§4.) This is Genesis 11:7: “let us go down, and there confound their language, that they
may not understand one another’s speech.”
§6.) This is a quote from E. Cioran’s Brief history of decay: “Life is what decomposes at
every moment; it is a monotonous loss of light, an insipid dissolution in the darkness,
without scepters, without halos.”

§7.) This is a famous line Ramon Rojo says in S. Leone’s movie A ﬁstful of dollars: “When
you want to kill a man you must shoot for his heart and a Winchester is the best
weapon.”
