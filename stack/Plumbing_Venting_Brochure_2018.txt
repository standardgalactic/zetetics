Methods of Venting 
Plumbing Fixtures and 
Traps in the 2018 IPC
Installation, Flexibility and Opportunity for Savings

Chapter 9 of the International Plumbing 
Code ® (IPC®) describes a variety of 
methods to vent plumbing fixtures and 
traps. The methods have been laboratory 
tested to determine sizing and installation 
requirements that provide proper venting 
to a drainage system. The venting 
methods have also been field tested, 
establishing a long history of satisfactory 
service. 
In this publication, we will present the 
various approaches to venting that are 
permitted in the 2018 IPC. You will find 
that these venting provisions offer the 
installer and designer different paths to 
achieving an adequately vented system, 
which could result in cost savings along 
with ease of installation in different types 
of construction.
Three Specific Venting Methods
Section 901.2.1 of the IPC establishes that traps and trapped fixtures shall be vented 
in accordance with one of the venting methods specified in this Chapter. Section 904.1 
requires the vent system serving each building drain to have at least one vent pipe that 
extends to the outdoors.
The most widely used method is commonly referred to as a conventional venting system. 
Table 909.1 (below) provides the maximum distance allowed for a vent in relation to the 
trap. A fixture vent connected in this manner is called an individual vent. These individual 
vents are sized according to Section 906.2. Here we find that the vent must be at least 
one-half the diameter of the drain served, but in no case less than 1¼ inches in diameter.

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm.
Remember, the vent size is not based on the trap or fixture drain (trap arm), but the drain 
size that continues downstream from the point where the vent and fixture drain connect. 
The drain size is determined by the fixture unit load in accordance with Tables 709.1, 
709.2, 710.1(1), and 710.1(2) in the IPC. Hence, if the drain size is 4 inches (102 mm), 
a 2-inch (51 mm) vent is required. A 3-inch (76 mm) drain would require a 1½-inch (38 
mm) vent. A 2-inch (51 mm), 1½-inch or 1¼-inch (38 or 31.8 mm) drain would require a 
minimum 1¼-inch (31.8 mm) vent, this being the minimum size allowed.
Section 905.5 allows individual vents to merge with each other, as long as the connection 
is made at least 6 inches above the flood-level rim of the highest fixture served. Sizing of 
Chapter 9 of the International Plumbing Code (IPC) describes a  
variety of methods to vent plumbing fixtures and traps. 
2  Methods of Venting Plumbing Fixtures and Traps in the 2018 IPC

the vents as they connect is again based only on the required size of the drain being served. 
Section 906.2 requires that vents exceeding 40 feet (1016 mm) in developed length shall 
be increased by one nominal pipe size for the entire developed length of the vent pipe. 
It is important to know that Section 904.2 states a vent stack shall be required for every 
drainage stack that has five branch intervals or more. If the drainage stack is less than five 
branch intervals in height, a vent stack is not required because the pressure in the drainage 
stack is not likely to create a pressure differential at the trap seals in excess of 1 inch (25.4 
mm) of water column. When required, vent stacks are to be dry and are required to connect 
at or near the base of the stack served to act as a relief vent for the pressures that develop 
in the lowest portions of the stacks. 
The exception in Section 904.2 wisely eliminates an unnecessary vent to a system that 
already has adequate fresh air exchange assurance. Waste stack vented systems, as covered 
in Section 913, are already oversized to provide for adequate venting without the need for 
additional venting.
The code only requires stack vents for drainage stacks in Section 913.3 because the 
minimum required venting of each fixture has been accomplished when the system 
complies with the venting methods outlined in Chapter 9. A stack vent is typically used as a 
collection point for vent pipes so that a single roof penetration can be made.
Keep in mind that “stack vents” and “vent stacks” are distinct. See definitions in the next 
section.
The example illustrates a typical vent stack compared with the special Waste Stack Venting system.

Definitions 
Branch Vent. A vent connecting one or more individual vents with a vent stack or stack vent.
Circuit Vent. A vent that connects to a horizontal drainage branch and vents two traps to no 
more than eight traps or trapped fixtures connected into a battery.
Combination Waste and Vent System. A specially designed system of waste piping 
embodying the horizontal wet venting of one or more sinks or floor drains by means of a 
common waste and vent pipe adequately sized to provide free movement of air above the 
flow line of the drain.
Common Vent. A vent connecting at the junction of two fixture drains or to a fixture branch 
and serving as a vent for both fixtures.
Individual Vent. A pipe installed to vent a fixture trap and that connects with the vent 
system above the fixture served or terminates in the open air. 
Stack Vent. The extension of a soil or waste stack above the highest horizontal drain 
connected to the stack. 
Stack Venting. A method of venting a fixture or fixtures through the soil or waste stack. 
Vent Stack. A vertical vent pipe installed primarily for the purpose of providing circulation of 
air to and from any part of the drainage system.
The developed length of individual, branch, circuit, and relief vents shall be measured from 
the farthest point of vent connection to the drainage system to the point of connection to 
the vent stack, stack vent, or termination outside of the building.
There are important criteria to remember when sizing a conventional venting system 
composed of individual fixture vents, vent stacks, and stack vents. The minimum size of an 
individual vent is one-half the required drain size, whereas the minimum size of the vent 
stacks and stack vents is one-half the size of the drain served.
The sizing criteria for stack vents and vent stacks are based on three variables:
1.	 The developed length of the vent.
2.	 The size of the stack served by the vent.
3.	 The total drainage fixture unit (DFU) connected to the stack.
Example A:
A 3-inch (76 mm) soil stack with a stack vent serving as the required vent extension to the 
outdoors, connecting to a 3-inch (76 mm) building drain, must have at least a 1½-inch  
(38 mm) stack vent [maximum of 102 fixture units served and a maximum 25-foot (7620 
mm) developed length] in accordance with Section 906.1 and Table 906.1. This 1½-inch 
(38 mm) stack vent is the minimum size required to comply with this section because it is 
at least one-half the size of the building drain.

Non-Conventional Venting Methods
Proper application of these venting options can 
substantially reduce the amount of pipe and fittings 
used, while still providing proper venting. Inspectors 
and plumbers often overlook the opportunities afforded 
by these different venting methods, which have been 
proven to save money and may be helpful in areas where 
conventional venting methods may be difficult to install.
Quality venting systems take careful planning

Island Fixture Venting
This is a specific method for venting an island 
sink, one limited to sinks and lavatories. 
Residential kitchen sinks with a dishwasher 
waste connection, a food waste grinder, or 
both, in combination with the kitchen sink 
waste, shall be permitted.
The island fixture vent shall connect to the 
fixture drain as required for an individual or 
common vent. The vent shall rise vertically 
to above the drainage outlet of the fixture 
being vented before offsetting horizontally or 
vertically downward. The vent or branch vent 
for multiple island fixture vents shall extend 
to a minimum of 6 inches (152 mm) above 
the highest island fixture being vented before 
connecting to the outside vent terminal.
 The vent located below the flood level rim 
of the fixture being vented shall be installed 
as required for drainage piping in accordance 
with Chapter 7, except for sizing. The vent 
shall be sized in accordance with Section 
906.2. The lowest point of the island fixture 
vent shall connect full size to the drainage 
system.
The connection shall be to a vertical drain 
pipe or to the top half of a horizontal drain 
pipe. Cleanouts shall be provided in the island 
fixture vent to permit rodding of all vent 
piping located below the flood level rim of the 
fixtures. Rodding in both directions shall be 
permitted through a cleanout.
As you can see from the diagram for this 
installation, this venting method provides for 
a free flow of air where liquid is not being 
trapped in the lowest portion of the vent, 
because of its connection to the drain. This 
method will work well in a crawl space or 
underground application.
Relief Vents—Stacks of More than  
10 Branch Intervals
This venting method requires a relief vent 
equal to the size of the vent stack it connects 
with for buildings exceeding 10 branch 
intervals. A relief vent must be located at 
every 10 branch intervals, measured from the 
highest horizontal drainage branch, and then 
calculated downward to the base of the stack.
The lower end of the relief vent is connected 
to the soil or waste stack below the level of 
Island Fixture Vent

6  Methods of Venting Plumbing Fixtures and Traps in the 2018 IPC

the horizontal branch that serves the 
floor level within the branch interval 
required to have the relief vent. The 
location of this connection is intended 
to allow waste that might get into the 
relief vent, including condensation, to 
reach a waste line. This connection is 
made using a wye fitting installed as a 
drainage fitting in order to not impair 
the flow. The upper connection of the 
relief vent is made to the vent stack 
and is to be located a minimum of 3 
feet (914 mm) above the floor level 
of the same horizontal branch. This 
connection is made using a wye fitting 
installed in an inverted position. The 
required 3-foot (914 mm) minimum 
height required is a common theme in 
Chapter 9 and is intended to prevent 
waste flow from entering the vent stack. 
Air Admittance Valves
The air-admittance valve (AAV) is a 
device designed to allow air to enter the 
drainage system to balance the pressure 
and prevent siphonage of the water 
trap when negative pressure develops 
in the system. In this way, it is used 
on individual vents, branch vents and 
circuit vents in lieu of terminating vents 
to the exterior of the structure. Stack 
vents and vent stacks are permitted to 
terminate to a stack–type air admittance 
valve. The exception is for stack vents or 
vent stacks that serve drainage stacks 
exceeding six branch intervals.
Because the AAV will not provide relief 
of positive pressures, there are certain 
installation requirements that are 
specified in the IPC to relieve positive 
pressure. The one open pipe vent 
required on every building drainage system in Section 918.7, Vent Required, and Section 
903.1, Roof Extension, mandates that at least one vent pipe shall extend to the outdoors to 
relieve the system’s positive pressure. Section 918.3.1 contains measures for pressure relief 
by requiring the installation of a relief vent where the horizontal branch is located more than 
four branch intervals from the top of the stack.
American Society of Sanitary Engineers (ASSE) has recently developed ANSI/ASSE 
Standard 1049—Performance Requirements for Individual and Branch Type Air Admittance 
Valves for Chemical Waste Systems. Air Admittance Valves (AAV) that are in compliance 
with ANSI/ASSE 1049 and meet the requirements of Section 702.5 and tested to ASTM 
F1412 for chemical resistance are now allowed to serve as the vent for non-neutralized 
special waste systems as an option to chemical waste vent piping terminating outdoors. It is 
quite common to see laboratory sinks that receive chemical waste located in islands in the

middle of rooms. To vent the system for these 
sinks using vent piping that can only terminate 
outdoors requires extensive labor and material. 
The use of the AAV’s will significantly reduce the 
cost of plumbing these laboratories.
Air admittance valves shall not be located in 
spaces utilized as supply or return air plenums. 
In these locations, the negative or positive 
pressure conditions could adversely affect the 
valves operation. 
Air admittance valves without an engineered 
design shall not be utilized to vent sumps or 
tanks of any type. The illustration below shows an 
example of one manufacturer’s engineered design 
for use of an air admittance valve on a sump. This 
design allows for positive pressure relief.
Air  admittance valves shall not be installed 
on outdoor vent terminals for the sole purpose 
of reducing clearances to gravity air intakes or 
mechanical intakes.
The installation of air admittance valves must conform 
to the requirements of Section 918.3 through 918.8 
and the manufacturer’s instructions. Where differences occur between the provisions of the code 
and the manufacturer’s instructions, the most restrictive provisions must be applied.
Engineered Vent Systems
This type of venting system is considered to be an alternative engineered design. Notice 
that according to Table 919.2, which provides criteria for determining cubic feet or air flow 
per minute for various diameters of pipe, a vent can be as small as ½ inch in diameter.
After the individual vent airflow rate is determined by the equation in Section 919.2, the 
size and developed length are determined by Table 919.2. The values in the table indicate 
the maximum developed length for a given pipe size and the individual vent airflow rate. 
Note that the engineered vent system must be designed, signed and sealed by a registered 
design professional and will need to be submitted for review by the code official in 
accordance with Section 105.3 of the IPC.
The graphic is an example of an engineered design

Common Vent 
This very simple concept allows two traps to be 
vented by the same vent. The two traps and their 
fixture drains can be either at the same level or at 
different levels, provided that they are on the same 
floor. The following diagrams show some of the 
various approaches to common venting. The sizing 
of common venting is specified in Table 911.3.

Waste Stack Vent
This is a very simple method of allowing a drainage 
stack to serve as a vent. It greatly extends the concept 
of a vertical common vent, except for some specific 
guidelines for installation. For this system to function 
effectively there cannot be any offsets in the waste 
stack portion. Once the highest branch interval is 
connected to the stack, the vent portion may contain 
offsets, provided such offsets are at least 6 inches 
above the branch interval connection. The size of the 
waste stack vent is to be in accordance with Table 
913.4. Note for reference: the size of the stack, 
which is based on the total branch intervals, shall be 
maintained the same size from the lowest point of the 
stack to the vent termination or connection to another 
approved vent. In other words, if the fixture unit total 
would require a 3-inch-diameter (76 mm) drain per 
Table 913.4, then both the stack and its vent must 
be 3 inches (76 mm) in diameter with no offsets at 
all until at least 6 inches (152 mm) above the highest 
branch interval (see diagram).
These two methods of using the drain as a vent, 
common venting and waste stack venting, are, for 
the most part, vertical in their application. Now let’s 
examine Wet Venting. This method is one of the three 
remaining methods of such venting that are more often 
found in a horizontal application.

Wet Venting 
A fixture is said to be wet vented when it serves also to carry the discharge from fixtures 
connecting into the drainage system at a higher level. The use of wet venting reduces the 
number of individual vent pipes required by a plumbing drainage system as contrasted with 
the number required by a conventional system and hence reducing the cost of the venting 
system. There are many types of venting schemes and methods allowed in the International 
Plumbing Code (IPC). The Horizontal Wet Venting method located in Section 912.1 of the 
IPC is one that we will discuss today.
What is a horizontal wet vent? A horizontal wet vent is a horizontal branch drain pipe that 
has been increased in size larger than what is normally required by Section 710. This 
increase in pipe size allows for a 
large air space above the maximum 
probable waste flow level in the pipe 
so as to provide for adequate venting 
airflow in the same pipe as the waste 
flow. Wet Venting as shown in Figure 
1 can be used in both vertical and 
horizontal applications.
The vertical method may be more 
common to plumbing installers in 
certain regions. However, don’t 
be alarmed by what you see. The 
horizontal wet venting method is 
an effective way to provide a safe, 
sanitary system that can save the 
contractor and owner time and 
materials.
The fixture drain length from the 
wet vent is limited to the distances 
shown in Table 909.1. There may be 
a situation where the fixture location 
is at a distance that exceeds the 
maximum trap-to-vent distance. 
The code allows for any number 
of individual vented fixtures of the 
types allowed for a bathroom group 
to connect to the horizontal wet vent 
as long the total number of fixtures 
allowed for the bathroom groups is 
not exceeded.

Section 202 of Chapter 2 is the key to the maximum number and type of fixtures that can 
be accommodated by a horizontal wet vent. The definition of Bathroom Group is a group 
of fixtures consisting of a water closet, lavatory, bathtub or shower, including or excluding 
a bidet, an emergency floor drain or both. Such fixtures are to be located together on the 
same floor level. This is done to avoid high flow velocities which could cause excessive 
turbulence that might block the air space above the waste flow level. Section 912.1 allows 
any combination of fixtures within two bathroom groups to be vented by a horizontal wet 
vent. A horizontal wet vent could have as few as two fixtures or as many as ten fixtures but 
not more than two fixtures of any type can be connected to the system. Each wet vented 
fixture drain shall connect independently to the horizontal wet vent. This is done to protect 
the function of each fixture, assuring that one fixture will not influence another’s operation.
The dry vent, the vent that continues upward from the wet vent to the point of termination 
of connection to another vent, shall be either an individual vent or a common vent for any 
bathroom group fixture, except an emergency floor drain. Where the dry vent connects to 
a water closet fixture drain, the drain shall connect horizontally to the horizontal wet vent 
system. Not more than one wet vented fixture drain shall discharge upstream of the dry 
vented fixture drain connection. 
Vertical wet vented systems are 
required to have the water closets as 
the most downstream fixture. This is 
not the case in horizontal wet venting.
The dry vent must be sized in 
accordance with Section 906.2. 
Remember, though, that in this case, 
the drain served is going to be the 
entire wet vented section. It will need 
to be at least one-half the diameter 
of the largest section of pipe in the 
system. The wet-vented section itself 
is sized per Table 912.3. Keep in 
mind that any additional fixtures 
outside of the wet vent that are to 
be drained into the same branch 
must be connected to the branch 
downstream of the wet vent. Because 
the wet vent serves as a drain, the 
type of fittings used must be in 
accordance with the drainage pattern 
shown in Table 706.

Circuit Venting 
The International Plumbing Code (IPC) has a variety of methods that can be used to vent 
plumbing fixtures and traps. Circuit venting is one of these methods and it has been 
laboratory and field tested, establishing a long history of satisfactory service. Extensive 
research into the performance of circuit vented systems was conducted at the State University 
of Iowa. The research concluded that the single vent for the eight fixtures provided the 
necessary protection of the trap seal. Circuit venting was included in Roy B. Hunter’s research 
at the National Bureau of Standards and reported in BMS 66. The venting method has long 
been recognized by the plumbing community and is included in the American Society of 
Plumbing Engineers Data Book. The principle of circuit venting is that the flow of drainage 
never exceeds a half-full flow condition. The air for venting the fixtures circulates in the top 
half of the horizontal branch drain pipe. The flow velocity in the horizontal branch is slow and 
non-turbulent, thereby preventing pressure differentials from affecting the connecting fixtures. 
The circuit-vented fixtures must connect to the circuit-vented branch in the horizontal plane to 
limit the amount of turbulence created by fixture discharge.

The Circuit Venting method is similar to wet venting except that it allows you to combine a 
total of eight fixtures on a single floor that are not limited to the two bathroom groups. It 
might be easier to explain by examining how circuit venting differs from wet venting. The 
fixture drains shall connect horizontally to the horizontal branch being circuit vented. Again, 
the fixture drains are limited in length to those shown in Table 909.1. Because circuit 
venting is only to be used on horizontal applications as opposed to wet venting, which can 
be both horizontal and vertical installations, the maximum slope for a circuit vent is 1 unit 
in 12 units horizontally, or 8-percent slope. The entire length of the circuit vent portion of 
the horizontal branch shall be sized for the total drainage discharge to the branch. There is 
not a unique sizing table for circuit venting as there is for wet venting or common venting.
The circuit vent connection must be located between the two uppermost fixture drains and 
shall connect to the horizontal branch. It cannot serve as a drain for other fixtures—it is 
truly a dry vent. Where a circuit vent consists of four or more water closets and discharges 
into a drainage stack that also receives the discharge of upper horizontal branches, a relief 
vent shall be connected to the horizontal branch ahead of the connection to the drainage 
stack and after the most downstream fixture drain of the circuit vent (see Figure 2). 
Additional fixture drains may be connected with the circuit-vented branch, but they need 
to be vented by means 
other than the circuit 
vent, and the fixture unit 
values would be added 
to the total fixture-
unit discharge into the 
horizontal branch. Such 
fixtures must also be 
located on the same 
floor as the circuit vent 
to which they connect. 
Where the relief vent 
receives the discharge 
of other fixtures, the 
maximum discharge 
allowed is 4 drainage 
fixture units.

Combination Waste and Vent System
This system is based on the same premise as the circuit-vented system. Most plumbing 
codes place arbitrary restrictions on combination drain (waste) and vent systems because 
the system appears too good to be true. The performance of the combination waste and 
vent system was verified in tests conducted at the Stevens Institute of Technology. If 
sized according to Table 915.2.2 in the IPC, the study concluded that the distance from 
a trap does not have to be limited in length. This is a horizontal wet vent system limited 
to floor drains, standpipes, sinks and lavatories for the purpose of venting, except that a 
vertical riser, not to exceed 8 feet in length, may be used to connect a fixture drain to the 
horizontal combination drain and vent system. Again, the idea here is that the top half of 
the horizontal drain acts as a vent. As long as both the horizontal drain and vent system and 
the maximum 8-foot riser to a fixture drain are sized in accordance with Table 915.2.2, the 
flow of free air will be sufficient for the propped design.

Of course, to get that free flow of 
air, a vent to the atmosphere must 
be provided. The vent, which must 
be sized for the total drainage 
fixture load of the combination 
drain and vent system per Section 
906.2, can be located anywhere 
on the system and must rise 
vertically at least 6 inches before 
offsetting. This type of system is 
unique in that a branch that is 
already vented can accept a fixture 
drain under this combination drain 
and vent method (see Figure 3). 
Remember, too, that this type of 
venting procedure is dependent on 
adequate sizing and maintaining 
a horizontal installation. For this 
reason, the horizontal portion must 
not exceed a slope of one-half unit 
vertical in 12 units horizontal, or 
4-percent slope. The horizontal 
length of a combination waste and 
vent system shall be unlimited.

The IPC continues to emphasize both prescriptive- and performance-related provisions. A 
proven venting system method was added in the 2012 IPC that now compliments the most 
extensive collection of venting options in the world.
Single Stack Vent System
The Single Stack Vent System was introduced into the IPC in the 2012 Edition and is based 
on a drainage stack system in the City of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) Plumbing Code which 
has been used successfully in many multi-story and high-rise buildings for over 100 years. The 
Philadelphia System is described in Volume 2, Chapter 3 of the American Society of Plumbing 
Engineers (ASPE) Data Book. The Philadelphia or ‘one pipe’ system refers to the use of one 
drainage stack instead of having separate drainage and vent stacks  The Philadelphia system 
successfully utilizes “S” traps for fixture traps located above the floor and within a specified 
distance from the stack. However, because the IPC prohibits the use of S traps, the Single 
Stack Vent System in the IPC utilizes an oversized vertical pipe from its connection at the 
end of the fixture trap’s fixture drain (also known by some tradesmen as a ‘trap arm’) to the 
horizontal drainage piping of the system. This is the same concept utilized in combination 
waste and vent systems for fixtures that are located above the floor. The oversized vertical pipe 
eliminates any possibility of siphoning of a fixture trap as the waste volume entering the vertical 
pipe could not possibly block the venting air space in the vertical pipe.  
In a Single Stack Vent System the drainage stack serves as both 
a single-stack drainage and vent system. The drainage stack and 
branch piping are considered as vents for the drainage system 
as a whole. Pipe sizing in a single stack drainage system is larger 
than in a conventional one, however a significant cost saving is 
achieved by the reduction of the vent piping needed. This venting 
system serves as a viable alternative to the more traditional 
systems that are being used. The length of trap arms is limited 
and the vertical drop from the fixtures is oversized also. Fixture 
connections that do not meet the requirement for a single stack 
system must be conventionally vented. The length of the trap arm 
is limited to reduce any suction buildup, and the stack is oversized 
to limit the internal air pressure and vacuum build up. Stacks 
greater than two branch intervals in height are prohibited from 
receiving the discharge of horizontal branches on the lower two 
floors. The separate stack serving the lower two floors, is required 
to connect to the building drain at a distance of not less than10 
pipe diameters downstream from the base of the connection of 
the single stack vented system. This proven method has been 
laboratory tested to determine sizing and installation requirements 
that provide proper venting to the drainage system. 
The size of a single stack drainage stack is based upon the 
height and the total number of dfu connected to the stack. 
Table 917.2 provides the stack dfu limitations according to 
stack height. The height of the stack is from the connection 
to the building drain to the uppermost drainage connection 
to the stack. Drainage stacks must be the same size from 
the base to the termination of the stack to the outdoors. The 
requirement for the stack vent to be the same size as the 
drainage stack allows the stack vent to be of any length on its 
path to its termination point outdoors.
For a 3-inch (76 mm) stack, there is a limitation of two water 
closets on the stack. This limits the amount of solids in this 
small diameter stack so that airflow is not impeded.

Table 917.2 is used simply by identifying the column that includes the height of the stack 
and then reading down that column to identify the row that has a dfu value that meets or 
exceeds the total dfu load on the stack. Once the row is identified, the user will find the 
stack size required from the first left-hand column. For example, the total load on the stack 
is 1000 dfu and the height of the stack is 150 feet (45,720 mm), the third column from 
the left is chosen and the row for an 8-inch (203 mm) stack size is identified. The “NP” in 
the table means not possible.
The sizing of the horizontal branches that connect to the stack is according to Table 
710.1(2). Only the first and second columns of this table are to be used for sizing. The 
remaining columns of the table covering stacks have no relationship to this section. For 
example, if a horizontal branch is required to carry 170 dfu, then a 5-inch (127 mm) 
horizontal branch is required.
A 3-inch (76 mm) horizontal branch with a water closet located within 18 inches (457 
mm) horizontal developed length of the stack has special limitations. If a water closet is 
located within 18 inches (457 mm) of the horizontal developed length of the stack and the 
connection is not made with a sanitary tee, then the only fixture that can be served by that 
horizontal branch is that water closet. If the connection to the stack of a 3-inch (76 mm) 
horizontal branch serving a single water closet is made using a sanitary tee, then one fixture 
having a 1½-inch drain can also be connected to the 3-inch (76 mm) horizontal branch.
Where a horizontal branch connects to the stack through a wye connection and the branch 
carries the discharge of one or more water closets, the water closet must be not more than 
4 feet (1219 mm) in horizontal developed length from the stack. If the connection at the 
stack is made with a sanitary tee, the distance limitation is extended to 8 feet (2438 mm) 
in horizontal developed length.
Section 917.5 specifies the minimum sizes for the vertical portions of the fixture drains 
(other than water closets), that are connected to horizontal branches. Vertical sections of 
the fixture drains are required for fixtures such as lavatories, wall hung urinals, and standard 
pipes with traps above the horizontal branch. The minimum size for any vertical section of 
fixture drain is 2 inches (51 mm), except where standpipes and water-supplied urinals have 
vertical sections of fixture drains, then the vertical section must be 3 inches (76 mm). If 
the vertical sections of the fixture drains cannot be of these minimum sizes, then the fixture 
drains must be vented by a method other than the single stack method.
18  Methods of Venting Plumbing Fixtures and Traps in the 2018 IPC

The height of the vertical section must not be greater than 4 feet (1219 mm). If the height 
is greater than 4 feet (1219 mm), then the fixture requires venting by a method other than 
the single stack method. In most situations, fixtures will not be greater than 4 feet (1219 
mm) above the horizontal branch so additional venting methods are typically not required.
In arrangements where a horizontal branch carries the discharge of two or more water closets 
and the horizontal developed length of other fixtures discharging to the horizontal branch 
exceeds the limitations of Section 917.4, then those fixtures (other than water closets) located 
beyond the developed length limitation require venting by a method other than the single stack 
method. Section 917.6 indicates all of the types of venting that can be used for this purpose.
Section 917.7 addresses horizontal offsets in a single stack vent system. Where horizontal 
branches or fixture drains connect below a horizontal offset of a stack, the offset requires 
venting in accordance with Section 907.
Fixture drain connections to the stack must be made in the area of the stack that is 2 
feet (610 mm) above or below the horizontal offset. Where there are no fixtures below the 
horizontal offset, the offset does not require venting. The total number of dfu coming from the 
stack is used to size the building drain and building sewer in accordance with Table 710.1(1).
Many experienced plumbers and Inspectors will agree that the venting requirements of a 
plumbing system are usually the most difficult to comprehend. The IPC contains more types 
of venting methods than are shown in other plumbing codes. As you continue to examine 
various methodologies, you will begin to see how they provide viable alternatives to “typical’ 
venting options.

Introduction
Protection of the water supply used for drinking, cooking, 
washing and bathing is one of the most important health 
and safety protection requirements of the plumbing code. 
History has many examples of local and widespread 
occurrences of sickness and disease caused by not 
safeguarding the water supply. Cross-connections are the 
links through which it is possible for contamination to 
enter a potable water supply. The contaminant enters the 
potable water supply when the pressure of the polluted 
source exceeds the pressure of the potable source. The 
action may be called “backsiphonage” or “backpressure.” 
The intent of the plumbing code is to eliminate cross-
connections or prevent backflow where cross-connections 
cannot be eliminated.
CodeNotes™ provides cross-connection scenarios and 
backflow prevention methods and devices in an organized 
and user-friendly approach in accordance with the 
requirements of the 2015 International Plumbing Code® 
(IPC®) and International Residential Code® (IRC®). 
It covers:
•  Cross connection potential and where backflow 
protection is required.
•  Backflow prevention devices, methods and installation 
limitations. 
• Other backflow prevention related information.
Cross Connection Potential and Where 
Backflow Protection is Required
The following are situations where there is potential for 
backflow to occur:
•  Irrigation systems (backflow of irrigation water into the 
potable water system through the sprinkler and emitter 
and leaks in the irrigation piping); see Figure 1. 
•  Sillcocks, hose bibbs, wall hydrants and other openings 
with a hose connection (backflow of insanitary water or 
liquid through the open end of the hose). 
• Toilet tanks (unapproved tank fill valves).
• Sinks and lavatories (unapproved air gap).
•  Coffee machines directly connected to the water 
supply (backflow of coffee into water supply).
•  Soft drink dispensing machines (backflow of carbon 
dioxide gas (CO2) into copper water supply line).
