Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to determine which scope of 
practice roles and responsibilities are attributed to the profession of audiology 
(AUD) relative to other health care disciplines by a group of health and human 
services faculty and students. 
Method: An online survey inquiring about participant knowledge of different 
health professions’ scopes of practice, and experience with and attitude toward 
the profession of AUD, was sent to faculty and students in the Western Michigan 
University College of Health and Human Services. Students also completed two 
subscales of the Interprofessional Attitudes Scale. Descriptive statistics and 
chi-square and Kruskal–Wallis analyses evaluating response differences between 
groups are presented. 
Results: Thirty-six faculty and 118 students (48 graduate and 70 undergraduate) 
completed the survey. AUD was the profession most often associated with all 
hearing-related scope of practice activities. Speech-language pathology was 
often associated with hearing-related scope of practice activities. Audiologists 
were less commonly associated with vestibular, balance, and mobility scope of 
practice activities. Group was significant for four scope of practice activities. 
About half of respondents indicated they knew nothing or a little about AUD, 
and a majority had no or rare interactions with audiologists in class or clinic. 
Only about half of participants responded they were likely or very likely to refer 
patients to an audiologist. 
Conclusion: Increased knowledge of the scope of practice and exposure to the 
profession of AUD may benefit other health care professionals and patients, pos-
sibly leading to increased interprofessional practice and an increased number of 
appropriate referrals. 
Current research evidence suggests interprofessional 
collaboration among health care professionals can result 
in significant benefits to patients, including improved 
patient outcomes, better utilization of resources, higher 
patient satisfaction, and fewer medical errors (Li et al., 
2018; Ulrich & Crider, 2017). For example, Guck et al. 
(2019) found a collaborative practice model in family 
medicine resulted in improved patient outcomes and a 
reduction in health care costs. A systematic review of the 
literature 
investigating 
patient 
satisfaction 
with 
team-
based models of care in hospitals revealed team-based care 
positively affected patient satisfaction, although the level 
of satisfaction was dependent on the number of individ-
uals on the team, as well as the manner in which the team 
members interacted (Will et al., 2019). The Institute of 
Medicine (US) Committee on Quality of Health Care in 
America (2000; now the National Academy of Medicine) 
proposed five principles for designing safety systems in 
health care organizations. One principle was to promote 
effective team functioning, because people make fewer 
errors when they work in teams. 
Recognition of the benefits of interprofessional col-
laboration has led to the incorporation of interprofessional 
education (IPE) into both the academic and clinical curric-
ula in health-related professions. The belief is students 
who learn about other disciplines and their roles during 
their formal classroom and clinical education will be more

likely to collaborate with these disciplines once they enter 
real-world practice. Professional organizations, such as the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), 
the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA), and 
the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) 
consider the ability to practice collaboratively as a core 
clinical competency (Accreditation Council for Occupa-
tional Therapy Education, 2018; APTA, 2019; Council 
on Academic Accreditation in Audiology and Speech-
Language Pathology, 2023; Interprofessional Education 
Collaborative [IPEC], 2016). 
Audiologists play a critical role in evaluating and 
managing disorders of hearing and balance and related 
problems. Their expertise is essential to the team of pro-
fessionals working with patients with these disorders. 
However, it is not clear whether other health-related disci-
plines understand the scope of practice in audiology 
(AUD). Spano-Szekely et al. (2019) investigated an inter-
professional team-based approach to fall prevention; how-
ever, there was no audiologist included on the team. Hear-
ing loss and acute vestibular syndrome (when the posterior 
circulation is affected) are potential sequelae of stroke 
(Bamiou, 2015; Steenerson, 2021). Moreover, strokes typi-
cally affect older individuals who are likely to have age-
related hearing loss. Yet, a PubMed search on “team-
based approach stroke audiologist” produced no results, 
whereas a search on “stroke rehabilitation audiologist” 
produced three results. In fact, a search for “interprofes-
sional” and “audiology” revealed no explicit examples of 
audiologists working on an interprofessional team. There 
are examples of IPE with a focus on hearing that are 
backed by audiologists, with AUD students participating 
alongside 
students 
from 
other 
health 
care 
disciplines 
(James et al., 2017; Skinner et al., 2022). However, there 
appear to be no other examples of IPE with hearing or 
balance involvement in which AUD students participate. 
Lack 
of 
awareness 
of 
the 
profession 
of 
AUD 
appears to be a problem in the academic setting as well. 
Two surveys of college students at a Pennsylvania univer-
sity revealed the majority did not know or were not sure 
what an audiologist does, although some of the respon-
dents who marked “not sure” were able to accurately 
describe what an audiologist does (Donai et al., 2013; 
Emanuel et al., 2012). In contrast, more than half of the 
participants in the 2013 study knew what an optometrist 
does. Brown et al. (2018) investigated an IPE model for 
fall risk assessment and prevention in older adults, but 
AUD students were not included, despite the existence of 
an AUD program at one of the participating universities. 
The respondents in the Donai et al. (2013) and 
Emanuel et al. (2012) studies were students who were just 
entering the university. The authors noted that this is a 
good time to recruit students to the profession of AUD; 
however, this will not happen if these undergraduate stu-
dents are unaware that the profession exists. It is impor-
tant to determine whether this finding that undergraduate 
students are not aware of the profession is replicable, so 
we can devise ways to increase their knowledge of AUD 
as a profession. 
In summary, the existing data suggest audiologists 
may be excluded from interprofessional health care teams 
due to limited awareness and understanding of the profes-
sion among both students and working professionals; 
however, more research is needed. The primary purpose 
of this study was to determine which scope of practice roles 
and responsibilities are attributed to the profession of AUD 
relative to other health care disciplines by a group of health 
and human services faculty and students to support IPE. A 
secondary purpose of this study was to determine if there is 
a difference between groups—faculty, graduate students, or 
undergraduate students—in their attribution of the scope of 
practice activities to audiologists. Our hypothesis is that 
undergraduates will be less aware of the scope of practice 
activities than the other groups. 
Method 
An anonymous electronic survey (exempt approval 
through Western Michigan University Human Subjects Insti-
tutional Review Board #19–02-53, open from March 18 to 
March 31, 2019) was sent via e-mail to approximately 3,400 
undergraduate and graduate students and faculty in the 
Western Michigan University College of Health and Human 
Services (CHHS) using a Google form. Informed consent 
was provided through participation in the survey. Our par-
ticipant pool represented a wide range of disciplines as 
CHHS unites a number of different health care disciplines 
under one college, including AUD, speech-language pathol-
ogy (SLP), blindness and low vision studies (BLVS), physical 
therapy (PT), physician assistant (PA), social work (SW), 
nursing, occupational therapy (OT), and public health. 
Participants indicated all applicable professions to 
the prompt “Which profession(s) can. . .” in 25 scope of 
practice areas (see Table 1). Areas of scope of practice 
were derived from scopes of practice and professional 
descriptions of CHHS-represented professions (Academy 
for Certification of Vision Rehabilitation & Education 
Professionals, n.d.-a, n.d.-b; American Academy of Audi-
ology [AAA], 2023; American Association of Physician 
Associates,

Workers, n.d.). One statement was eliminated due to pos-
sible misunderstanding, leaving 24 items for the final

analysis. Participants also rated their knowledge of, inter-
actions with, likeliness of referrals to, and general impres-
sion of AUD on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = very poor, 5 =  very 
good) and provided open-ended comments explaining their 
impression ratings. Students also completed the Team-
work, Roles, and Responsibilities and Interprofessional 
Biases subscales of the Interprofessional Attitudes Scale 
(Norris et al., 2015). Descriptive statistics were used to 
present all responses. Chi-square analyses and Kruskal– 
Wallis tests were used to evaluate whether groups—F, G, 
or UG—differ in response rate to each scope of practice 
activity. We hypothesized that more faculty than students 
(and particularly undergraduate students) would accu-
rately indicate whether audiologists could perform each 
activity given the results from the Donai et al. (2013) 
study in which over half of their undergraduate respon-
dents indicated they did not know or were not sure what 
an audiologist does.

Respondents 
most 
often 
associated 
AUD 
with 
hearing-related scope of practice activities. SLP was the 
second most common profession associated with perform-
ing a hearing screening, performing a diagnostic hearing 
evaluation, prescribing and training on assistive devices 
for hearing, and performing auditory/aural rehabilitation. 
PA was the second most common profession associated 
with visual inspection of the ear and diagnosing hearing 
loss. Scope of practice activities related to vestibular, bal-
ance, and mobility were most often attributed to PT and 
OT. However, AUD was most often associated with inter-
preting vestibular and balance test results, followed by PT 
(see Table 3). 
Respondents also associated AUD with the ability 
to perform other activities, including speech screenings or 
assessments, prescribing and training someone with assis-
tive devices for communication, assessing literacy, screen-
ing for cognitive impairments, screening for psychological 
health and well-being, taking blood pressure, and ordering 
lab tests or imaging (see Table 4). 
Chi-square analyses were used to determine whether 
responses to scope of practice items differed between fac-
ulty (F), graduate students (G), and undergraduate stu-
dents (UG), with Kruskal–Wallis tests used for post hoc 
pairwise comparisons. Table 1 contains a summary of sta-
tistics and significance levels. Results demonstrated signifi-
cant chi-square for four scope of practice activities: per-
forming a diagnostic hearing evaluation, χ2 (2) = 6.198, 
p = .045; performing an assessment for fall risk, χ2 (2) = 
12.670, p = .002; providing rehabilitation services for daily 
acts of living, χ2 (2) = 9.366, p = .009; and training on 
using adaptive devices to enhance visual function, χ2 (2) = 
6.598, p = .037. Post hoc analyses were performed to 
determine which group responses were different from the 
others using a Bonferroni p value correction for multiple 
comparisons. All faculty respondents indicated that per-
forming a diagnostic hearing evaluation was within the 
AUD scope of practice (F: 100%, G: 97.9%, UG: 90.0%); 
however, there was no significant difference between 
groups after the Bonferroni correction. Significantly fewer 
undergraduate students than faculty indicated audiologists 
could perform an assessment for fall risk (F: 41.7%, G: 
27.1%, UG: 11.4%; UG vs. F: H[2] = 23.283, p = .002). 
Significantly more faculty than undergraduate students 
indicated audiologists could provide rehabilitation services 
for daily acts of living (F: 27.8%, G: 10.4%, UG: 7.1%; 
UG vs. F: H[2] = 15.889, p = .009). Finally, significantly 
more faculty than undergraduate students reported they 
believed audiologists could train on using adaptive devices

to enhance visual function (F: 8.3%, G: 2.1%, UG: 0.0%; 
UG vs. F: H[2] = 6.417, p = .033). Overall, there was a 
trend for more faculty than any other group to consider 
these activities part of the AUD scope of practice. 
Undergraduate students tended to agree that these activi-
ties are within an audiologist’s scope less often. However, 
faculty were not always the most accurate, as our hypoth-
esis states, as faculty were more likely to associate training

Participants were asked to rate how much they knew 
about the profession of AUD on a 5-point scale (none, a 
little, some, quite a bit, a lot/this is my profession); how 
often they have directly interacted with the profession of 
AUD (none, rarely, sometimes, most of the time, almost all 
of the time); and how likely they were to refer to AUD in 
their profession (very unlikely, unlikely, neutral, likely, very 
likely; see Table 5). Forty-two percent of faculty respon-
dents indicated they knew nothing or a little about AUD, 
followed by 53.2% of graduate students, and 62.3% of 
undergraduate students. A high number of participants 
indicated they had no or rarely had direct interactions 
with AUD. About half of faculty participants indicated 
they were likely or very likely to make referrals to AUD, 
along with 54.3% of graduate students and 58.1% of 
undergraduate students.

Participants were also asked to provide a rating of 
their general impression of the profession of AUD, rang-
ing from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good), and provide open-
ended comments regarding their impressions. Average 
impression ratings were generally favorable: faculty (4.3, 
range: 3–5), graduate students (4.0, range: 1–5), under-
graduate students (3.8, range: 1–5; see Table 5). Several 
open-ended comments relayed a lack of knowledge about 
or experience with AUD (F: 20.0%, G: 38.2%, UG: 
50.0%). A sample of comments is in Table 6. 
Graduate and undergraduate students also com-
pleted two subscales (Teamwork, Roles, and Responsibili-
ties and Interprofessional Biases) of the Interprofessional 
Attitudes Scale. The majority of students strongly agreed 
or agreed shared learning has many benefits for their own 
education and practice, as well as patient care. Many stu-
dents indicated they felt interprofessional biases exist and 
may interfere with patient care (see Table 7). 
Discussion 
Understanding 
the 
roles 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
health care professional partners is one of the four core 
competencies of interprofessional collaboration outlined 
by the IPEC (2016) and is an essential quality of an effec-
tive interprofessional team (Nancarrow 
et al., 2013).

Through this study, we primarily sought to assess faculty 
and student knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of 
the profession of AUD. Our results were in contrast to 
those of Donai et al. (2013) in that well over half of our 
student participants associated AUD with hearing-related 
scope of practice activities. These activities are well within 
the AUD scope of practice (AAA, 2004; ASHA, 2018). 
Despite AUD being well-recognized for hearing-related 
scope of practice activities, not all respondents indicated 
audiologists are able to perform all of these activities. For 
example, while 100% of faculty recognized audiologists 
could perform hearing screenings, only 88.9% realized 
they could perform a visual inspection of the outer ear, 
ear canal, and ear drum (i.e., otoscopy). Donai et al. 
found that students were able to more accurately describe 
the role of podiatrists and optometrists than audiologists 
in an open-ended question. The survey described herein 
provided a closed set of scope of practice activities with 
contrasting activities from other professions from respon-
dents may have been able to deduce hearing-related scope 
of practice activities. The purposes of these two surveys 
was different in that Donai et al. sought to determine 
awareness of the profession of AUD among incoming col-
lege students, and this survey collected data on specific 
roles and responsibilities of audiologists as understood by 
students and faculty in an interprofessional light. Donai et al. 
reported 54.8% of student respondents indicated they were 
“no, definitely not” or “not sure” what an audiologist does. 
Our numbers were  similar across groups for a similar item.  
Participants were asked to indicate how much they know 
about the profession of AUD. The percentage of respondents 
indicating “none” or “a little” were 42% for faculty, 53.2% 
for graduate students, and 62.3% for undergraduate students. 
Both studies highlight the need for greater awareness and 
understanding of the profession of AUD. 
Table 6. Sample of open-ended comments regarding impressions 
of profession of audiology. 
Faculty
•
“Bad experiences friends have had with hearing aids.”
•
“I have had good experiences referring to audiologists and 
audiology students are usually very professional. I don’t 
always refer or interact with audiology as a pediatric OT.”
•
“Could not detail what distinguishes this field but do 
understand the importance of hearing on overall health and 
wellness.”
•
“I work closely with audiologists and understand the importance 
of identifying hearing problems, particularly for children who 
are learning speech/language and for older adults who often 
become socially isolated because of a hearing problem.” 
Graduate students
•
“Helping people hear so that they can communicate is 
extremely important.”
•
“It is very important for our clients to have good hearing in 
order to communicate well with them during treatment.”
•
“I don’t know really anything about it other than they focus 
on helping people who are deaf or have hearing loss.”
•
“I know a little bit about audiology, but my understanding of 
what they can do is very limited and at this time I don’t see 
how our fields (social work and audiology) would interact.” 
Undergraduate students
•
“I don’t know very much about this degree except that they 
assist with people in hearing.”
•
“I have family members who have worked with audiologists, 
so their profession is important to me.”
•
“I think audiology is important as it goes hand in hand with 
the profession I study. Understanding the affects of hearing 
on an individuals language and daily functioning is critical to 
fully develop a plan of care to assist all individuals.”
•
“I do not know a lot of about audiology but I know that it is 
important.” 
SLP was often the second-most associated profession 
with hearing-related scope of practice activities, including 
performing a hearing screening, performing a diagnostic 
hearing evaluation, diagnosing hearing loss, prescribing 
and training on assistive devices for hearing, and perform-
ing auditory/aural rehabilitation. Only performing hearing 
screenings and auditory/aural rehabilitation are clearly 
within the SLP scope of practice (ASHA, 2016). These 
results indicate AUD and SLP may be seen as two very 
similar professions by health care faculty and students, 
possibly because they are often housed within the same 
academic department. 
Interestingly, although SLP and AUD students are 
typically educated together, particularly at the undergrad-
uate level, Davis et al. (2021) discovered this does not nec-
essarily mean they will collaborate once they become 
working professionals. In their survey of practicing audiol-
ogists and speech-language pathologists, they found only 
40.2% of speech-language pathologists were collaborating 
with audiologists, despite 60% having clients with hearing 
loss on their caseloads. Moreover, both groups indicated 
there was a lack of understanding regarding the other’s 
profession. If these practitioners, who often share aca-
demic coursework and even clinical practicums, do not 
understand one another’s scope of practice, it is not sur-
prising that individuals from other disciplines do not 
understand the scope of practice of AUD. 
Aside from interpreting vestibular and balance test 
results, scope of practice items related to vestibular, bal-
ance and mobility were attributed most often to PT and OT. 
Both physical therapists and occupational therapists are able 
to engage in these activities, whereas audiologists are less 
likely to be attributed to them. Despite this, audiologists 
were fairly well represented when it came to performing 
vestibular/balance rehabilitation (42.2%), although respon-
dents were less inclined to attribute audiologists to fall 
risk assessments (23.4%). Faculty respondents were more 
likely to indicate audiologists could perform fall risk

assessments (41.7%) than graduate (27.1%) and under-
graduate (11.4%) students. This lack of knowledge is con-
sistent with the research discussed in the Introduction

Many respondents indicated they had no or only a 
little knowledge about the profession of AUD (F: 42.0%, 
G: 53.2%, UG: 62.3%) and over half of each group 
(F: 61.0%, G: 75%, UG: 68.3%) reported having no or 
rare interactions with the profession of AUD. These 
health care professionals and students would benefit from 
AUD participation in IPE events and opportunities, thus 
increasing their knowledge of the AUD scope of practice. 
James et al. (2017) described a successful adult hearing 
loss–based IPE event with both AUD and PA students, in 
which significant improvements were noted in the areas of 
knowledge of roles and responsibilities and communica-
tion between professionals. Improved knowledge of pro-
fessional roles through IPE can foster trust between pro-
viders (James et al., 2017), which could result in more 
effective, collaborative patient care (Reeves et al., 2013; 
Shakhman et al., 2020). Importantly, IPE could lead to 
appropriate 
referrals 
to 
other 
health 
care 
providers 
(Shakhman et al., 2020), possibly increasing the likelihood 
of referrals to AUD. In this study, only about half of 
participants or a little over half indicated they were likely 
or very likely to make referrals to AUD (F: 49.0%, G: 
54.3%, UG: 58.1%). Increased knowledge about and direct 
interactions with AUD may also result in an increase in a 
favorable impression of the profession of AUD. There 
was some effect of group (faculty, graduate student, or 
undergraduate student) on responses to whether specific 
activities were part of the AUD scope of practice (i.e., 
performing an assessment for fall risk, providing rehabili-
tation services for daily acts of living, training on using 
adaptive devices to enhance visual function). Faculty were 
significantly more likely than undergraduate students to 
indicate performing an assessment for fall risk, providing 
rehabilitation services for daily acts of living, and training 
on using adaptive devices to enhance visual function were 
within the realm of AUD. In terms of our hypothesis, fac-
ulty were not always more accurate in determining which 
scope of practice items were appropriate for audiologists 
as evidenced primarily by the training on using adaptive 
devices to enhance visual function item. Undergraduate 
students were significantly less likely to indicate activities 
like performing an assessment for fall risk were under the

scope of audiologists. This may reflect a difference in years of 
experience or education related to understanding another pro-
fession’s scope of practice or that a profession may be able to 
engage in the same or similar activities to another profession. 
Additionally, this is in line with Donai et al. (2013) in that 
undergraduate students were not familiar with the role of an 
audiologist. This suggests providing information about the 
profession during the undergraduate years might help in 
recruiting more students to choose AUD. 
Including AUD in IPE activities is critical, but it must 
be noted that providing effective IPE requires a particular set 
of instructional skills that are different from single profession 
instruction (van Diggele et al., 2020). However, as noted by 
the American Council on Education (2022), universities are 
facing high levels of faculty burnout, as well as problems 
recruiting and retaining faculty. Adding yet another responsi-
bility to faculty workloads will only contribute to this prob-
lem. Thus, faculty across all health care disciplines should be 
provided with release time to develop these skills. Future 
research should focus on ways to incorporate the development 
of IPE instructional skills into faculty workloads in ways that 
avoid faculty burnout. Furthermore, an additional problem 
that academic institutions might face regarding the inclusion 
of audiologists in IPE is that AUD may not have a presence 
in the institution. 
Finally, research has shown students introduced to 
evidence-based practice do not necessarily translate that 
evidence to clinical practice once they have graduated 
(Shelton et al., 2018; Way & Dixon, 2019). It is not clear 
that IPE translates to interprofessional practice (Musaji 
et al., 2019; Zwarenstein & Reeves 2006). This topic is a 
current focus of review for the IPEC and the Association 
of Academic Health Sciences Libraries (IPEC, 2022). 
Future research also should continue to explore the effects 
of IPE on real-world interprofessional health care. 
There are limitations to this study. This study was 
conducted by AUD students and may have been biased 
toward AUD. We countered this by including scope of 
practice items from multiple CHHS professions, rather 
than only AUD. Furthermore, the participant group 
included individuals from speech, language, and hearing 
sciences, which may or may not have influenced the 
results by some participants having a better understanding 
of the AUD scope of practice. However, we felt it was 
important to represent all CHHS disciplines in the final 
analysis. With that said, we did not get student participants 
from all CHHS programs, in particular, BLVS and PT. 
The scope of practice item “prescribe and train you with 
assistive devices for communication” was intended to 
inquire about activities relating to augmentative/alternative 
communication. Participants may have interpreted this as 
including hearing aids or other devices for communication. 
There are three main strengths of this study. First, 
we included a wide range of professions, some of which 
may be found less frequently in a college of health profes-
sions, such as SW. Second, we inquired about a wide vari-
ety of health care scope of practice activities, allowing us 
to 
see 
overlap 
in 
perceived 
professional 
areas 
(e.g., 
vestibular/balance assessment, fall risk assessment) and 
areas of misunderstanding (e.g., hearing-related areas, 
such as hearing evaluation or prescribing assistive devices 
for hearing, which were associated with SLP). These areas 
may lend themselves to interprofessional events or activi-
ties for students in these disciplines. Finally, this study has 
a strong focus on the field of AUD. Consequently, we are 
able to provide insight into how well faculty and students 
understand the roles and responsibilities of audiologists. 
In summary, our study revealed that students and 
faculty in other health-related disciplines need a better 
understanding of the profession of AUD. This can be 
accomplished by ensuring AUD has a role in IPE activi-
ties. In addition, we need to ensure there are faculty mem-
bers in the health care disciplines who are provided with 
the time and the opportunity to learn about effective 
methods for delivering IPE. Finally, we need to determine 
whether and how collaborative skills learned in IPE are 
translated to professional practice.
