Abstract
Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) can provide
exquisitely detailed information about the structure and
dynamics of proteins. It is challenging, however, to extract
such information from RDC measurements in conforma-
tionally heterogeneous states of proteins because of the
complex relationship between RDCs and protein structures.
To obtain new insights into this problem, we discuss
methods of calculating the RDCs that do not require the
deﬁnition of an alignment tensor. These methods can help
in particular in the search of effective ways to use RDCs to
characterise disordered or partially disordered states of
proteins.

Introduction
As the conformational ﬂuctuations of proteins play deci-
sive roles to enable their functions (Frauenfelder et al.
1991; Dobson et al. 1998; Boehr et al. 2006; Mittermaier
and Kay 2006; Vendruscolo and Dobson 2006; Shaw et al.
2010; Kalodimos 2011; Sekhar and Kay 2013), an impor-
tant goal is to pursue the development of approaches
capable of providing accurate representations of these
motions. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
is particularly suitable for this purpose since this technique
provides time- and ensemble-averaged measurements at
atomic-level resolution (Palmer 2004; Boehr et al. 2006;
Mittermaier and Kay 2006; Tolman and Ruan 2006; Ven-
druscolo and Dobson 2006; Kalodimos 2011; Salmon et al.
2011; Markwick and Nilges 2012; Jensen et al. 2013; Se-
khar and Kay 2013). For this reason, NMR measurements
on proteins can only be analysed approximately in terms of
individual structures. This problem is not immediately
evident in the case of highly structured native states,
because when the conformational ﬂuctuations are of small
amplitude it is possible to identify an average structure that
corresponds quite well to a given set of NMR measure-
ments. By contrast, if the conformational ﬂuctuations are of
larger amplitude, it becomes necessary to represent the
state of a protein by using an ensemble of structures, so that
the average values of the NMR parameters over the
ensemble reproduce closely the experimentally measured
values (Kessler et al. 1988; Torda et al. 1989; Bonvin et al.
1994; Best and Vendruscolo 2004; Clore and Schwieters
2004; Lindorff-Larsen et al. 2005; Vendruscolo 2007;
Krzeminski et al. 2009; Huang and Grzesiek 2010; Ca-
milloni et al. 2012; Marsh and Forman-Kay 2012; Guerry
et al. 2013; Jensen et al. 2013; Varadi et al. 2013). In this
case, individual structures are not expected to exhibit val-
ues for the NMR parameters that match exactly the
experimental ones. In this sense, the problem of calculating
the values of NMR parameters from individual structures is
not well deﬁned, as such values are not measurable
experimentally because of the averaging procedure that
unavoidably takes place during the measurements. In the

presence of conformational ﬂuctuations, therefore, com-
putational methods for characterising the behaviour of
proteins should be based on the comparison between
experimental parameters and average values estimated over
ensembles of conformations (Kessler et al. 1988; Torda
et al. 1989; Bonvin et al. 1994; Best and Vendruscolo
2004; Clore and Schwieters 2004; Lindorff-Larsen et al.
2005; Vendruscolo 2007; Krzeminski et al. 2009; Huang
and Grzesiek 2010; Camilloni et al. 2012; Marsh and
Forman-Kay 2012; Guerry et al. 2013; Jensen et al. 2013;
Varadi et al. 2013).
The problem of extracting information about structure
and dynamics from NMR parameters is particularly chal-
lenging in the case of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs)
(Tjandra and Bax 1997; Tjandra et al. 1997; Tolman et al.
1997), since the values of these NMR parameters tend to
have a strong structural dependence, and hence to experi-
ence large ﬂuctuations as a protein explores its conforma-
tional space (Louhivuori et al. 2006; Salvatella et al. 2008).
In practical terms, in the presence of conformational ﬂuc-
tuations of large amplitude even the most accurate methods
for calculating the RDCs for a given structure (Zweck-
stetter and Bax 2000; Fernandes et al. 2001; Almond and
Axelsen 2002; Azurmendi and Bush 2002; van Lune et al.
2002; Ferrarini 2003; Zweckstetter 2008; Berlin et al.
2009; Montalvao et al. 2011) may not provide values that
can be expected to match the experimental ones. A close
agreement between calculated and experimental RDCs can
in these cases be obtained only when the calculated RDCs
are averaged over an ensemble of structures representing
the motions of the protein (Clore and Schwieters 2004;
Best et al. 2006; Showalter and Bruschweiler 2007; Lange
et al. 2008; De Simone et al. 2009; 2011; 2013a, b; Huang
and Grzesiek 2010; Fenwick et al. 2011; Montalvao et al.
2011; Sgourakis et al. 2011; Lindorff-Larsen et al. 2012;
Marsh and Forman-Kay 2012; Guerry et al. 2013; Jensen
et al. 2013).
In this Perspective, we review various approaches to
calculate RDCs and discuss their possible advantages to
characterise the conformational ﬂuctuations of proteins
from RDC measurements.
The RDC between two nuclear spins
The RDC between two nuclear spins of gyromagnetic
ratios c1 and c2 at a given distance r can be expressed as
(Bax 2003)
D ¼ Dmax
3 cos2 #  1


=2


ð1Þ
where # is the angle between the inter-nuclear vector and
the external magnetic ﬁeld, Dmax = -l0c1c2h/8p3r3 is the
maximal value of the dipolar coupling for the two nuclear
spins, l0 is the magnetic constant and h is the Planck
constant. The averaging speciﬁed by the angular brackets
describes the variations in the orientation of the inter-
nuclear vector with respect to the external magnetic ﬁeld
caused by thermal motions. In isotropic solutions RDCs
average to zero because all directions are equivalent, but
when the orientational symmetry is broken non-zero values
of the RDCs may appear (Saupe and Englert 1963;
Bothnerby et al. 1981; Tolman et al. 1995; 1997; Tjandra
and Bax 1997; Tjandra et al. 1997; Bax 2003; Blackledge
2005; Thiele 2007).
Calculation of RDCs using alignment tensor methods
When a structural model of the protein is available, there
are several ways to carry out the average in Eq. (1) to
estimate the corresponding RDCs. The most common
approaches involve the deﬁnition of an alignment tensor,
either explicitly (Saupe and Englert 1963; Bothnerby et al.
1981; Tjandra and Bax 1997; Tjandra et al. 1997; Clore
et al. 1998; Losonczi et al. 1999; Meiler et al. 2001; Bax
2003; Blackledge 2005; Thiele 2007; Habeck et al. 2008)
or implicitly (Moltke and Grzesiek 1999; Sass et al. 2001),
a procedure that is particularly convenient if a protein
populates a rigid structure, so that the only important
degrees of freedom in Eq. (1) concern the relative orien-
tation of the molecule with respect to the alignment med-
ium. In this case, one should consider just 5 degrees of
freedom for the rotations and 3 further degrees of freedom
for the translations of a protein molecule. More generally,
if a protein undergoes conformational ﬂuctuations, it is still
possible to deﬁne an alignment tensor, although in this case
the averaging has to be carried out not only over the
rotations and translation of the molecule with respect to the
alignment medium, but also with respect to its internal
degrees of freedom.
The alignment tensor of a given protein conformation
can be obtained through ﬁtting procedures, such as the
singular-value decomposition (SVD) method (Losonczi
et al. 1999), in which the alignment tensor is chosen to
optimise the agreement between calculated and experi-
mental RDCs. Alternatively the alignment tensor can be
determined by structure-based procedures in which this
quantity is calculated on the basis of the shape and charge
of the protein molecule and the alignment medium
(Zweckstetter and Bax 2000; Fernandes et al. 2001;
Almond and Axelsen 2002; Azurmendi and Bush 2002;
van Lune et al. 2002; Ferrarini 2003; Zweckstetter 2008;
Berlin et al. 2009; De Simone et al. 2011, 2013a, b;
Montalvao et al. 2011), without reference to experimen-
tally-measured RDCs.
These two approaches are differently suitable depending
on the situation. This aspect can be understood in particular
in the presence of conformational ﬂuctuations of large

amplitude. In this case, the calculation of the average
RDCs corresponding to an ensemble of conformations
involves the deﬁnition of a different alignment tensor for
each conformation in the ensemble. In approaches in which
the RDCs are ﬁtted to a structure, to simplify the calcula-
tions one can assume that all the conformations in the
ensemble have the same alignment tensor, which, however,
is often not an accurate approximation (De Simone 2013a,
b). Alternatively, to achieve greater accuracy, one can
obtain the alignment tensor of each individual conforma-
tion by a separate ﬁtting to the experimental RDCs. In this
case, however, an impractically large number of experi-
mental RDCs is required in order to avoid overﬁtting.
Therefore, ﬁtting methods are at risk of failing to capture
the full changes in the alignment tensor during the con-
formational ﬂuctuations (De Simone et al. 2011, 2013a, b;
Montalvao et al. 2011).
In the presence of conformational ﬂuctuations it is more
effective to use structure-based methods (Louhivuori et al.
2003; Bernado et al. 2005; Esteban-Martin et al. 2010;
Huang and Grzesiek 2010; De Simone et al. 2011, 2013a,
b; Montalvao et al. 2011). In this case, each member in a
structural ensemble can be associated with its own align-
ment tensor without the need of using experimental data. In
practice, the averaging in Eq. (1) is carried out both over
the external degrees of freedom, which involve rotations
and translations, and the internal ones, which involve
conformational ﬂuctuations of a protein.
Calculation of RDCs using tensor-free methods
As mentioned above, the alignment tensor was originally
introduced as a convenient mathematical procedure to
calculate RDCs in the cases when a protein structure could
be considered as rigid (thus avoiding the explicit inclusion
of the conformational ﬂuctuations in the calculations) and
the alignment tensor could be ﬁtted from the RDC data
(thus eliminating the need of considering explicitly the
rotations and translations of the protein with respect to the
alignment medium). However, starting from Eq. (1), one
can also calculate an RDC numerically without the need of
deﬁning an alignment tensor as
D ¼ Dmax



In this expression, R is the vector of the positions of all the
atoms of the protein and the alignment medium (including
the solvent), and
PB R

ð3Þ
is the Boltzmann factor for the conﬁguration R of the
system, where T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, Z is the partition function and E(R) is the energy
of the system, which includes the internal energy of the
protein and the interaction energy between the protein and
the alignment medium.
With the availability of increasingly powerful computers
it is becoming possible to calculate this statistical average
without making strong assumptions to reduce the com-
plexity of the system, in particular about the amplitude of
its structural ﬂuctuations, and to facilitate the use of RDC
measurements in challenging cases such as those of con-
formationally heterogeneous states of proteins.
In this context, a major complication in calculating the
integral in Eq. (2) comes from the need of obtaining an
accurate estimate of the Boltzmann factors PB. For the
Boltzmann factors, the primary challenge is to account for
the electrostatic interactions between the protein and the
alignment medium, which represent the most complicated
contributions to the total energy E(R) of a given confor-
mation R of the system. Effective available approaches are
based on adaptations of the Gouy-Chapmman theory to
describe the electrical double layer near the surface the
alignment medium (Zweckstetter 2008; Montalvao et al.
2011).
Another major complication in calculating the integral
in Eq. (2) comes from obtaining an accurate sampling of
the conformational space. Standard approaches to this
problem are based, as mentioned above, on the introduction
of the alignment tensor, which involves a separation of the
internal (i.e. of the protein) and external (i.e. of the
alignment medium) degrees of freedom

where the integral over the internal degrees of freedom, Ri,
can be calculated separately from that over the external
ones, Re. In this approach, as the angle # depends on both
the internal and external degrees of freedom, one performs
ﬁrst a change of variables by introducing an internal
reference frame and its orientation with respect to the
laboratory frame (Saupe and Englert 1963; Bothnerby et al.
1981; Tolman et al. 1995, 1997; Tjandra and Bax 1997;
Tjandra et al. 1997; Bax 2003; Blackledge 2005; Thiele
2007). To separate the integral one also assumes that
PB Ri; Re

ð5Þ
which implies the assumption that the alignment medium
does not affect the internal degrees of freedom of the
protein molecules, but only their overall orientations with
respect to it. This approximation holds if the interactions
between the protein molecules and the alignment medium
are weak, which may not be the case in particular in the
presence of strong electrostatic interactions.

Calculation of RDCs for highly-structured states
When the internal degrees of freedom can be considered as
frozen, as the protein is assumed to undergo negligible
conformational ﬂuctuations, it is convenient to adopt ten-
sor-based approaches, since in this way the external
degrees of freedom, which are the only remaining ones in
Eq. (2), are considered concisely through the deﬁnition of
the alignment tensor. Thus, Eq. (2) can be recast as Eq. (4),
which effectively becomes an algebraic expression. As
discussed above, the alignment tensor can be obtained by a
ﬁtting procedure to experimental data (Losonczi et al.
1999), or by numerical methods based on the shape and
charge of the protein (Zweckstetter and Bax 2000; Fer-
nandes et al. 2001; Almond and Axelsen 2002; Azurmendi
and Bush 2002; van Lune et al. 2002; Ferrarini 2003;
Zweckstetter 2008; Berlin et al. 2009; De Simone et al.
2011, 2013a, b; Montalvao et al. 2011).
Calculation of RDCs for conformationally
heterogeneous states
When the internal degrees of freedom of a protein molecule
are considered as variable, they should be taken explicitly
into account in Eq. (2) alongside the external ones. Thus, to
calculate RDCs, one should devise efﬁcient methods for
carrying out the sampling of conformational space of the
system composed by the protein and the alignment
medium.
A powerful approach, which is based on rewriting
Eq. (2) as Eq. (4), is to perform molecular simulations of
the protein molecules in the absence of the alignment
medium to obtain an ensemble of conformations with sta-
tistical weights corresponding to PB(Ri) in Eq. (5), and
then, for obtaining the RDCs, to calculate for each con-
formation of the ensemble the integral over the external
degrees of freedom (Mukrasch et al. 2007; Jensen et al.
2010; Terakawa and Takada 2011; Marsh and Forman-Kay
2012; Guerry et al. 2013).
An alternative strategy, if experimental measurements
are available, is to use them to bias the sampling of con-
formational space (Kessler et al. 1988; Torda et al. 1989;
Bonvin et al. 1994; Best and Vendruscolo 2004; Clore and
Schwieters 2004; Lindorff-Larsen et al. 2005; Vendruscolo
2007; Huang and Grzesiek 2010). In this context, the use of
the measurements as replica-averaged structural restraints
in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations enables to
modify a force ﬁeld to match the experimental data
according to the maximum entropy principle (Pitera and
Chodera 2012; Cavalli et al. 2013; Roux and Weare 2013).
If the experimental measurements used as restraints are the
RDCs, it may still be convenient to separate the internal
and external degrees of freedom in Eq. (4), as in this case
the integral over the internal degrees of freedom can be
considered effectively constant over a time interval (e.g.
0.1 ps) that is fairly long with respect to the integration
time-step (e.g. 2 fs), thus avoiding its costly evaluation at
every time-step. In practice, therefore, one reintroduces in
this way an alignment tensor, with the difference that in
this case the structure of the protein is approximated as
rigid not in an absolute sense, but only on the sub-pico-
second timescale, which can be fairly accurate even in
highly dynamical states (De Simone et al. 2011, 2013a, b;
Montalvao et al. 2011).
More generally, tensor-free approaches based on Eq. (2)
can also be used to test the validity of the assumption that
the introduction of the alignment medium does not alter the
structure of a protein, which is required to separate the
variables in Eq. (4) and thus deﬁne the alignment tensor.
By comparing the RDCs calculated with Eq. (2) and Eq. (4)
one may obtain an indication of the extent to which an
alignment medium perturbs the conformational properties
of a protein.
Correspondence between RDCs and protein structures
An aspect of RDC calculations that should be considered is
whether one is interested in: (1) the problem of obtaining
estimates of RDCs measured experimentally, or (2) the
problem of estimating RDCs corresponding to individual
structures. These two problems effectively coincide if a
protein populates a highly-structured state with small
conformational ﬂuctuations, but are distinct in the case of
conformationally heterogeneous states. This point can be
understood with reference to Eq. (4) since the calculation
of the RDCs corresponding to a given structure does not
involve the integration over the internal degrees of freedom
of the protein itself, but only over the external ones, which
can indeed by achieved effectively by calculating an
alignment tensor. By contrast, the prediction of RDCs
measured experimentally should involve also the explicit
integration over the internal degrees of freedom to obtain a
conformational averaging.
Conclusions
We have discussed possible motivations for considering
methods of calculating residual dipolar couplings that do
not require the deﬁnition of an alignment tensor. Subject
to the development of efﬁcient computational strategies,
these methods may offer novel opportunities in particular
in the case of conformationally heterogeneous states of
proteins.
