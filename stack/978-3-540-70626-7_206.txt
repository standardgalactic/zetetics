Similar echo phenomena can be observed in any multilevel quantum system
subject to inhomogeneous relaxation, such as, e.g., in two-level atom and ions, for
which echoes occur in the optical spectral range, where they are then called photon
echoes. See also  magnetic resonance; spectroscopy; spin.

Spin Statistics Theorem
Arianna Borrelli
The term spin-statistics theorem is used to indicate theoretical explanations of the
connection exhibited by non-relativistic quantum systems of identical particles be-
tween the particles’  spin and their quantum-statistical behaviour. In such systems,
particles of integer spin follow  Bose–Einstein statistics, while particles of half-
integer spin obey  Fermi–Dirac statistics. High-precision experiments have not
revealed any violations of this rule [8]. In the framework of relativistic  quantum
ﬁeld theory, it is possible to show that, under the assumption that all particles are ei-
ther bosons or fermions (symmetrization postulate), the spin-statistics connection is
a consequence of basic physical postulates such as relativistic  invariance, positive
energy or time-reversal invariance.
From 1936 until today, a number of proofs of the connection between spin and
statistics have been offered, with varying degrees of rigour and generality and
imposing on the theory different physical requirements and limitations [10–12].
The proof which eventually entered textbook-tradition was given by Wolfgang
Pauli (1900–1958) in 1940, and relied on results obtained previously by his assis-
tant Markus Fierz (1912–2006) (1939) [1]. In the 1960s, the term “spin-statistics
theorem” established itself to indicate these demonstrations, even though they

are usually not equivalent to each other. The term was introduced by Raymond
F. Streater (1936–) an Arthur S. Wightman (1922–) in their summary of axiomatic
quantum ﬁeld theory (1964) [7].
In its quantum-relativistic formulation, the theorem states that, when quantizing
a ﬁeld ψ(x) (i.e. when formally transforming it into an  operator), one is not free
to choose at will between commutation and anticommutation relations, but has to
impose the one or the other according to the way in which the ﬁeld ψ(x) transforms
under a change of the relativistic reference frame (Lorentz transformation). If the
“wrong” choice is made, the quantized theory will not fulﬁl physically signiﬁcant
requirements such as positive energy, positive probability, invariance under time-
reversal, or the condition that the inﬂuence of interactions should not propagate
faster than light ( locality).
In the non-relativistic limit, the Lorentz transformation properties of ψ(x) de-
termine its behaviour with respect to space rotations, and therefore the spin of the
corresponding particles: scalar ﬁelds have spin 0, vectors have spin 1, Dirac-spinors
have  spin 1
2, and so on. The choice between commutation and anticommuta-
tion relations translates into the  symmetry or antisymmetry of the non-relativistic
many-particle  wave function, and determines whether the particles will obey
Bose–Einstein or Fermi–Dirac statistics. The connection between spin and statistics
observed in non-relativistic quantum systems is thus shown to be a consequence of
imposing physical requirements in the relativistic framework.
All versions of the spin-statistics theorem have to make some initial assump-
tions on the mathematical form of the theory. For example, some authors deal only
with the lowest spin values (0, 1
2, 1), some only with noninteracting particles, others
weaken the requirement of relativistic invariance. The proofs of the spin-statistics
connection reﬂect both the history of quantum ﬁeld theory and the different ap-
proaches to it, variously giving priority to rigorous axiomatic structure, maximum
generality, minimal requirements, or the simplicity of the arguments.
Early proofs, including Pauli’s 1940 paper, relied on mathematical procedures
whose legitimacy was only proved years later, and sometimes also on manipulations
which are today regarded as illegitimate. From the late 1940s onward, with the de-
velopment of the mathematical apparatus of quantum ﬁeld theory, more rigorous and
elaborated proofs were formulated. Interest in the subject has remained lively and,
in 2000, a conference was devoted to “The spin-statistics connection and commu-
tation relations”, summarizing the many theoretical and experimental developments
in the ﬁeld, with particular attention to possible violations of the symmetrization
postulate.
In his 1940 paper, Pauli proved the spin-statistics connection for noninteract-
ing ﬁelds corresponding to any spin value by requiring positive energy and locality
[1, 10, 12]. He assumed the generic ﬁeld ψ(x) to obey linear differential equations
whose solutions could be expressed as a superposition of plane waves ei(kμxμ). Using
the classiﬁcation of the representations of the Lorentz group introduced by Bartel
van der Waerden (1903–1996), Pauli was able to classify the behaviour of all pos-
sible candidates to the role of energy-momentum operator and show that, if ψ(x)
corresponded to half-integer spin values, the energy function would not be positive

deﬁnite. From this he concluded, as Fierz had done before him, that a ﬁeld ψ(x)
with half-integer spin had to be quantised with anticommutation relations so that,
by using the ensuing  exclusion principle, an inﬁnite number of negative-energy
states could be regarded as being already occupied. In this way, one would in the
end recover a physical system with positive energy.
To prove the second part of the theorem, Pauli implemented locality by requiring
that  operators derived from ψ(x) and associated to physical quantities should
commute for spacelike separations, i.e. for events which, in some reference frame,
occur at the same time in two different places. He showed that, when a ﬁeld with
integer spin was quantized according to anticommutation rules, this condition would
lead to a relation implying that the ﬁeld is identically zero. This result was based on
a mathematical argument whose legitimacy was proved only years later.
In 1949, Richard Feynman (1919–1988)used his newly developed computational
techniques for  QED to show that the spin-statistics-connection follows from the
requirement that probability values must be ⩽1 [2]. In 1964, Steven Weinberg
proved the spin-statistics theorem both for fermions and for bosons by requiring that
quantized ﬁelds should either commute or anticommute for spacelike separations
[6, 13].
In the context of axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory, much attention has been de-
voted to the spin-statistics theorem and to its relationship with the invariance of the-
ories with respect to the combination of time-reversal, charge-conjugationand parity
transformation ( CPT-theorem). Julian Schwinger (1918–1994) endeavoured to
determine the conditions under which both the spin-statistics theorem and the CPT-
theorem would obtain (1958) [3]. Gerhard L¨uders (1920–1995) and Bruno Zumino
(1923–) (1958) and, contemporarily but independently, Nicholas Burgoyne (1932–
1958) instead proved the spin-statistics theorem on the basis of postulates such as
Lorentz invariance, positive energy and positive metric of the  Hilbert space, and
then used it as a starting point to prove the CPT-theorem [4, 5].
Works on the spin-statistics theorem have relied on increasingly complex mathe-
matical arguments, and some authors have attempted to ﬁnd what they felt would be
a “simple” demonstration. Ian Duck (1933–) and George Sudarshan (1931–) have
historically reviewed the subject from this point of view, and Sudarshan has of-
fered a proof based on rotational invariance (1997) [11]. In the last decades, various
authors have investigated the spin-statistics connection outside the boundaries of
standard relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory, for example in non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, supersymmetry or superstrings, often relying on topological arguments.
Most recently, a formulation of the spin-statistics theorem for classical mechanics
has been proposed (J. A. Morgan 2004) [9].

Squeezed States
Martin Bodo Plenio
In this section we will discuss some basic properties of so-called squeezed quantum
states. These states are characterized by the property that they will exhibit ﬂuctua-
tions for some physical observable quantities that are smaller than the ﬂuctuations
when the same quantity is measured on the vacuum state. Such states, often for
optical ﬁelds, have applications in various areas of physics ranging from enhanced
measurement precisions to quantum information processing.
A pure squeezed state [1] may be represented as a  wave function in position
