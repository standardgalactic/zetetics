 Pref ace 
 Recently, many improvements have been made in ironmaking processes. 
Additionally, legislative regulations have been modiﬁ ed. As a result, an updated 
approach to, and description of, the new problems is not present in the literature as 
a scientiﬁ c book. Recent technological and metallurgical improvements due to the 
new regulations and the provisional future regulations need a key point in the scien-
tiﬁ c literature. Our book offers a complete panorama of industrial steelmaking prob-
lems, leading to partial or total solutions of high-quality products with low 
greenhouse emissions impact. 
 The aim of the book is to provide readers with an in-depth knowledge of speciﬁ c 
topics within the ﬁ eld of steelmaking with a focus on greenhouse emissions control 
and reduction. The chapters are written by acknowledged specialists in their ﬁ elds. 
Beginners and experts will both ﬁ nd in the book a useful instrument and resource 
for topics relating to steel-production-product quality and plant efﬁ ciency-green-
house emissions abatement. The book describes the main phases of steel produc-
tion, from raw materials to reﬁ ning, through the discussion of the control, operations, 
and instrumentation, always relating to the effect on the emissions and pollutants. 
 The book gives also a broad panorama of the different legal regulations all 
around the world, coupled with the different technological solutions, thanks to the 
contribution of scientists from 18 different countries. 
 The book is divided into four main parts reﬂ ecting the following broad areas of 
steelmaking:
 –  Sintering plants’ operations, from raw material handling to the big plants’ pro-
ductivity to the most innovative technologies available for hazardous emissions 
control and reduction  
 –  Blast furnace operations, from CO 2 mitigation to recent technologies ﬁ nalized to 
the furnaces efﬁ ciency to the numerical modelling of blast furnaces operations 
 –  Electric arc steelmaking, from the emissions control to the most recent technolo-
gies available for carbon and special steel 
 –  Greenhouse emissions, from the energy consumption to the radically innovative 
technology to the future trends of steelmaking  

vi
 Due to the importance of the topic, it is believed that the book will be revised in 
the future reﬂ ecting changes in technologies and legal regulations and standards. 
 My special acknowledgments to the passion and cooperation of all the authors 
and reviewers who made possible the realization of the book and the reduction of 
the publication time with their hard work and prompt responses. 
 My special thanks to the professionalism of the editorial ofﬁ ce assistants. Finally, 
I would like to dedicate the work to my parents and to my children, Paolo and 
Alessandro.

 Chapter 1 
 Sinter Plant Operations: Raw Materials 
 Jin-Luh  Mou and  R.  John  Morrison 
 Abstract   The raw materials for an integrated steelworks can be classiﬁ ed into four 
categories, which are iron ores, ﬂ uxes, fuels, and reverts. The characteristics of 
these raw materials strongly affect the metallurgical properties of iron ore sinter and 
sinter plant performance. An optimal ore blend design is therefore essential to 
 produce low cost and high quality hot metal. Without doubt, some hazardous 
 components are brought into the production process, and therefore, there are some 
associated pollutants. A good preparation of raw materials is the ﬁ rst step for in- 
process anti-pollution action. This chapter will introduce the common materials 
used in iron ore sintering and the handling procedures in an integrated steelworks.  
1.1  Introduction to the Raw Materials 
Used in an Integrated Steelworks 
1.1.1  Iron Ores 
1.1.1.1  Iron Ore  Fines 
 Based on the mineralogy, iron ores include hematite, magnetite, and goethite; a pure 
hematite (or others) is really rare but a mixture of different iron ore minerals is 
 common. Most of the ores normally consist of hematite + magnetite + goethite; 
the ratio of mineral types can be roughly identiﬁ ed from the FeO and LOI content. 
The higher the FeO the higher magnetite will be, the higher LOI the higher the 
 goethite content will be. 
 Based on the porosity, iron ores are classiﬁ ed as either a porous type or a dense 
type. Normally, the iron ores with crystalline water or combined water also have 
high porosity. More highly weathered deposits also usually have higher porosity.

1.1.1.2  Iron Ore  Lump 
 Based on the particle size, iron ores are classiﬁ ed as iron ore ﬁ nes (<10 mm) or iron ore 
lump (6.3–31.5 mm); iron ore ﬁ nes are ﬁ rst processed in a sinter plant, while lump ores 
can be charged into the blast furnace (BF) directly. Iron ore lump is the lowest cost iron 
bearing material for the BF burden. Around 25–30 % under size  lump (normally <10 mm) 
is screened out in the BF stock house and fed back to the sinter plant as iron ore ﬁ nes.  
1.1.1.3  Concentrate 
 If an iron deposit with a lower Fe content needs to be upgraded through a series 
crushing, milling, ﬂ otation, and magnetic separation processes, the product is called 
iron concentrate (<200 mesh or 75 μm). Concentrates are normally processed into 
iron ore pellet. A decade ago, Chinese steelworks followed the Japanese HPS 
(Hybrid Pelletized Sinter) process and developed the so-called  mini-pellet sintering 
process , which uses lime milk as the binding matrix and uses a mixing drum to 
granulate the concentrate into mini-pellet; it is then put into a sinter machine to 
produce the grape type sinter, with excellent reducibility in blast furnaces.  
1.1.1.4  Pellet 
 Pellet is made from iron concentrate with a nickname of “smoothing pill” because 
of its round shape and value for the burden permeability inside blast furnace. It is 
easy to roll under the distribution chute of blast furnace; therefore the blast furnace 
shape is slimmer when using high  pellet ratio and squat for high sinter ratio.

1.1.2  Fuel 
1.1.2.1  Coke Breeze 
 Coke is the major reductant and heat source for blast furnace operation, where the 
lump coke (25–80 mm) is charged into blast furnace directly, and nut coke (15–
25 mm) is mixed with the iron burden (sinter, pellet, or lump) and then charged into 
the furnace. The <15 mm under size portion (~15 % of coke production) is screened 
out in the coke oven screening station, and then crushed to <5 mm as the fuel for the 
iron ore sintering process. 
J.-L. Mou and R.J. Morrison

 The combustion heat from coke breeze provides the necessary energy for partial 
melting of the iron ore ultra-ﬁ nes and ﬂ uxes to generate the bonding melt. The asso-
ciated S and N contents in coke breeze convert to SOx and NOx and become the 
major pollutant sources of an integrated steelworks. Suppose a sinter plant con-
sumes coke breeze of ~50 kg/t.sinter, and the BF coke rate is around 500 kg/t. HM . 
The estimated gases generated from sinter plant are SOx ~35 % and NOx ~28 % of 
the total emissions in an integrated  steelworks (Mou  1998 ). 
 Owing to the incomplete combustion, the un-burnt carbon fragments and chlo-
rine become bonded together under the catalytic effect of Fe or Cu (or their oxides) 
to form PCDD/Fs. The analysis data showed the toxicity ﬂ uctuates from ~0.5 to 
~3.0 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 depending on the materials being used and the operational con-
dition (Kasai et al.  2001 ). A more detailed description will be discussed later. 
 Obviously, coke breeze is the major pollution source in the iron ore sintering pro-
cess, where the S exists either in organic or inorganic phase, where the organic phase 
is hard to remove during the coal washing or the following coking process. Normally, 
using Australian coking coal would have 0.5–0.7 % of S remaining in the  coke     . 
 A sinter pot test conducted by Japanese steel mills using 79 % Ar + 21%O 2 to 
check the NOx formation in sintering process concluded that fuel NOx is the major 
route rather than thermal NOx (Suzuki et al.  1975 ). N exists in coke in the amine 
form and is difﬁ cult to remove in the coking process. Not all the N in coke breeze 
converts to  NOx ; this depends on the coke breeze combustion conditions, the higher 
the sinter bed permeability the lower the NOx generated. Normally the conversion 
ratio is around 30–35 % (Hida et al.  1980 ). 
1.1.2.2  Anthracite 
 Anthracite is a deeply metamorphosed type of coal with low volatile matter 
(VM—around 6–10 %) and high ﬁ xed carbon. It is a natural coke. Comparing the 
price with coke breeze, anthracite is much cheaper. Japanese steel mills use 
anthracite to replace coke breeze due to insufﬁ cient coke supply and reduce the 
sinter plant fuel costs. 
 Higher VM content generates another problem in the sintering process, the gas 
ﬂ ow is from the top surface and passing through the sinter bed into the wind box and 
exhaust gas pipe, where VM is released out under the combustion zone before being 
ignited and sucked into the waste gases pipe, eventually adhering to the electrostatic 
precipitator plates and wires; for some time, the dust removal  efﬁ ciency deteriorates 
and causes smolder, especially when the manhole is opened and  fresh air ﬂ ows into 
the EP during  repair . 
 North Korea anthracite is an excellent clean fuel with the low sulfur content (S 
less than 0.3 % or even less than 0.18 %). It is used to replace coke breeze (30–
50 %) to reduce SOx emissions; an example from China Steel Corporation had 
shown the actual SOx emissions were reduced from 110–130 to ~70 ppm. Low 
sulfur anthracite is now being applied in iron ore sinter plants as a countermeasure 
to reduce SOx emissions.

1.1.2.3  Biomass ( Carbonized Palm Shell ) 
 Many kinds of biomass can be used in the iron ore sintering process, but two issues 
should be considered. The ﬁ rst is the processing cost, and the second is the VM level. 
For example, palm trees are popular in South East Asian  countries  ; after the palm oil 
is extracted the shells are dumped as garbage or used as crude fuel in rural areas. 
Since the palm shell size is good for the sintering process, attempts have been made 
to use carbonized palm shell in the process. The collecting, transporting, and pro-
cessing costs, however, are even higher than for coke breeze, and this eventually 
restricts the level of application. Another issue is the VM level of over 15 % after 
carbonization. The combustion speed in the sinter bed is too fast under such high VM 
levels and the sinter bonding strength becomes weak, and the quality  deteriorates     . 
 The advantages of using biomass are to reduce fossil fuel usage and reduce 
greenhouse gases emissions; the second is the S level is extremely low, which is 
effective in reducing SOx emission. The processing techniques need to be improved 
to reduce VM level; otherwise, the replacing ratio of coke breeze is low and cannot 
provide the advantage of using biomass. Table  1.1 shows the speciﬁ cations of dif-
ferent fuels used in the  sintering process .
1.1.3  Fluxes 
1.1.3.1  Limestone 
 The chemical formula of limestone is CaCO 3 ; it is used in lime production and iron 
ore sintering. Limestone can be classiﬁ ed as primary sedimentary limestone and 
re-crystallized marble  limestone . 
 Primary sedimentary limestone is known as reef limestone with relict  fossil   
(commonly shell or coral reel) and porous texture. A strong water adhering ability, 
makes it good for granulation of the sinter raw mix, and therefore improves the sin-
ter bed permeability and increases the productivity. In addition, the ﬁ ne crystalline 
and porous texture provides a high reactivity of CaO with Fe 2 O 3 to form a calcium 
ferrite bonding matrix. The generated liquid melt volumes are higher than from 
marble limestone, and increase the bonding portion and enhance bonding strength. 
Marble limestone also can be applied in the sintering process, but has lower reactiv-
ity, and the productivity and strength are poorer than using reef carbonate.

 The size of limestone used in the sintering process will strongly affect the sinter 
plant performance; however, if we are looking for higher productivity, then a coarse 
limestone particle is required (<6.3 mm), if we want higher sinter strength, then 
ﬁ ner  particles are  utilised (<3 mm). 
 Burnt lime is an essential ﬂ ux for the steelmaking process, especially for de- 
sulfurization, converter slag forming, and the RH reﬁ ning process. Normally, mar-
ble limestone is more suitable for producing burnt lime than reef material. Limestone 
decomposes at 900–950 °C; marble particles expand ﬁ rst and then shrink during the 
heating stage, micro fractures are generated and the lump particle breaks into small 
particles. If the marble has a micro-crystalline texture, the stress occurring during 
the heating stage would be absorbed as the grain boundary surface energy and 
reduce the  breakage . 
 If reef limestone is used for lime production, its surface would become over 
burnt, partial melting occurs and the melt would become coated on its surface and 
reduce the lime reactivity. If some clay is associated with the reef limestone, some 
low melting point compounds such as di- or tricalcium silicate (C 2 S, C 3 S) will form 
and cause a clogging  problem . 
1.1.3.2  Dolomite 
 The chemical formula of dolomite is CaMgCO 3 , it provides the MgO source for 
blast furnace slag formation. MgO does not participate in the bonding phase of iron 
ore sinter, nor does it help to improve sinter strength. MgO (periclase) exists inde-
pendently in the SFCA (silico ferrite of calcium and alumina) or replaces Fe 2+ of the 
crystal structure of magnetite. 
 Dolomite is also processed in lime kiln to produce light burnt dolomite for steel-
making. Since the converter refractory is MgO or MgO-C bricks, in order to protect 
the MgO base refractory, the converter slag should be oversaturated to control the 
MgO diffusion from slag to wall, rather than from wall to slag. In  addition , MgO 
may improve the ﬂ uidity of  slag . 
 Dolomite decomposes at two temperatures (~700 and ~950 °C), so the breakage 
portion is higher than limestone. Light burnt dolomite has strong water absorption 
capacity, and quickly loses its reactivity. 
 It is recommended that the light burnt material is utilized as soon as it is 
 processed . 
1.1.3.3  Serpentine or  Olivine 
 The serpentine group describes a group of common rock-forming hydrous 
magnesium iron phyllosilicate ((Mg, Fe) 3 .Si 2 O.5(OH) 4 ) minerals; the most com-
mon serpentine mineral is antigorite. Olivine with a similar composition of 
(Mg,Fe)SiO 4 , provides both MgO and SiO 2 for blast furnace slag formation in iron 
making  process . 
1 Sinter Plant Operations: Raw Materials

10
 Serpentine  and  olivine are also used in the iron ore sintering process as a ﬂ ux. 
Serpentine dehydrates around 400–700 °C and converts to Mg-olivine (forsterite) 
and amorphous MgSiO 3 ; under iron rich conditions, low melting compounds (such 
as fayalite + forsterite) turn into the bonding melt, where the MgO exists in a silicate 
melt rather than in Periclase form, and provides a silicate bonding phase. Normally, 
using serpentine or olivine as the MgO source will show better sinter strength and 
productivity than using dolomite. 
 The  restriction on using serpentine or olivine in the sintering process is the SiO 2 
level in iron ore ﬁ nes; the blast furnace slag consists of four components,—CaO, 
MgO, SiO 2 , and Al 2 O 3 —and among those certain ﬁ xing ratio ranges are important 
(B2 = CaO/SiO 2 = 1.15–1.25, 
B3 = (CaO + MgO)/SiO 2 = 1.40–1.45, 
B4 = (CaO + MgO)/(SiO 2 + Al 2 O 3 ) = 1.00–1.10). If the SiO 2 were high in slag, then 
the other components will adjust accordingly to maintain the B2, B3, B4, this will 
increase the slag volume and need further fuel and decrease the productivity. In the 
last  decade , owing to the strong demand for steel products in China, many iron ore 
deposits were mined out and dumped to the market without proper processing, and 
the gangue impurities such as Al 2 O 3 and SiO 2 remaining in the iron ore ﬁ nes are 
much higher than before, and this restricts the serpentine and olivine  usage . 
1.1.3.4  Silica Sand 
 Silica sand is normally used in the glass industry; the purpose of using silica sand in 
iron making is to maintain the B2, B3, B4 ratio in the blast furnace slag. The silica 
sand is added to the sinter raw mix and brought into the furnace within the sinter 
ores. The melting point of silica is 1750 °C, which makes the formation of bonding 
melt in sintering process difﬁ cult. A better option to adjust the SiO 2 level in sinter is 
by using serpentine or olivine, unless they are not available. Table  1.2 shows the 
chemical composition of ﬂ uxes for iron ore  sintering .
1.1.4  Reverts 
 During the iron, steel making and rolling process, many dusts, slags, scales, slurries, 
and sludge are produced; these reverts contain valuable C and Fe, and are worth 
recovering. These reverts also contain some un-welcome compounds, such as PbO, 
ZnO, Na 2 O, K 2 O, sulfates, and chlorides. From the view point of physical

properties, their particles are extremely ﬁ ne or extremely large, and need further 
processing. Many recovery processes have been developed, such as RHF (Rotary 
Hearth Furnace), oxy-cup, mini-pellet process, and so on, trying to recover these 
reverts at the lowest cost and without secondary pollution; a revert homogenization 
process will be introduced in the raw materials handling  section . 
1.1.4.1  Dust 
 Dust arises from fugitive particles being collected through dry processes, such as 
electrostatic precipitator (EP), cyclone, or bag ﬁ lter. If the waste gas volume is large 
(>10 6 Nm 3 /min) and having a high dust concentration (>1000 mg/Nm 3 ), then EP is 
recommended. Particles pass through an electric ﬁ eld and being polarized with elec-
tric charges are then collected by electric plates and wires; eventually, dust is col-
lected in hoppers by rapping the plates and wire frames. Some high electric resistant 
materials such as alkali chlorides are difﬁ cult to polarize and difﬁ cult to remove from 
the waste gases. These particles are within the sub-micron range (<1.0 μm). The 
aerosols would take shape as these particles behave like nuclei, and acid gases con-
dense on their surface, which scatter the visible light and cause the opacity  problem . 
 If the gas volume was smaller and with coarse fugitive particles, then cyclone is 
recommended. The waste gas stream is conducted into a spiral channel, to reduce 
the gas diffusion speed and condense the particles under their own gravity, but dust 
removal efﬁ ciency is not as good as EP. 
 Bag ﬁ lter is a pressure ﬁ ltration device; particles are trapped by the ﬁ lter cloth 
under the high pressure gas current. The waste gas handling capacity is ﬂ exible by 
installing different number of ﬁ ltration tubes. The newest technique is able to 
remove the particles above 0.5 um, but the disadvantage of bag ﬁ lter is the caking 
problem, especially under high moisture or sticky materials, the caking would block 
the ﬁ ltration pores and shorten the ﬁ lter life. 
1.1.4.2  Scale 
 Mill  scales are oxidized iron from the continuous casting line (CC), hot strip mill, 
or bar and wire rod mills; these oxidized iron materials are composed mainly of FeO 
and with TFe of >70 %. Mill scales are able to provide heat in the iron ore sintering 
process owing to the oxidation of FeO to Fe 2 O 3 , and save some fuel. 
 Water guns are installed for de-scaling from slab, bloom, or billet surfaces during 
the CC or rolling process. These scales are collected in sedimentation ponds, the 
coarse mill scales are trapped in a whirlpool, and the ﬁ ne pit scales are trapped in an 
advection pool. Due to the leakage of lubricant oil or grease in the processing lines, 
these oils can accumulate in advection pools and seep in between the pit scale layers 
and make the pit scale become oily mill scale. The oil content can be sucked into the 
waste gas main and adhere to the EP plates when recovering pit scale in sintering 
process—this smoldering problem occurs when the oil content is too high. A routine 
check of oil content in EP dust is essential to prevent smoldering.

1.1.4.3  Sludge and Slurry 
 Sludge is a condensed viscous wet mixture and slurry is in a semi-liquid form, both 
are from the wet de-dusting or de-fume processes to trap fugitive ﬁ ne particles. The 
major sources of sludge and slurry are from the blast furnace gas puriﬁ cation system 
and converter off-gases treatment  system . 
 Two stage de-dusting devices are installed in the traditional blast furnace; the 
ﬁ rst is a gravity cyclone to trap coarse particles, and the second device is a wet type 
scrubber. Some steelworks apply dry dust catching systems by using cyclones and 
bag ﬁ lters, the dust is removed but the acid gases, especially HCl and H 2 SO 4 , remain 
in the gas and condense to liquid phase with a very low pH value, eventually, caus-
ing a serious pipe corrosion problem. An alkali solution injection is required to 
maintain the pH value. However, dry cleaning processes need sophisticated opera-
tional skills. 
 Oxygen is injected into the steelmaking converter to burn C inside the liquid 
metal, hence, the liquid steel temperature increase to around 1700 °C, and the off- 
gases temperature is also high around 1500 °C; therefore, Venturi mist spraying 
systems are installed to reduce the gas temperature and trap the dust within the 
mist + dust particles. These particles are separated from the off-gas system by grav-
ity and drop into the slurry tank. A vacuum ﬁ ltration device is installed to remove 
the water and turn these particles into ﬁ ltration cake. This cake contains very high 
FeO and C and recoveries are through the iron ore sintering process. The remaining 
slurry is injected into sinter blend mixing drums as granulation  moisture . 
 Scraps are charged into the converter as coolants; some Zn and Pb from automo-
bile scrap are also brought into the converter and evaporated into the waste gas 
system. Eventually, basic oxygen furnace (BOF) off-gas cake and slurry may con-
tain ZnO and PbO and cause clogging problems in the blast furnace. Therefore, a 
proper treatment is required to separate ZnO and PbO before putting the cake and 
slurry into the sintering process.  
1.1.4.4  Slag and Slag  Tailing 
 Blast furnace slag (production) ratio is around 300 kg per tonne of hot metal; the 
typical chemical composition is shown in Table  1.3 .
 The slag can be cooled by air or water quenching; air cooled slag is a gravel pav-
ing material with low application value. Water quenched slag with amorphous tex-
ture is called  Blast Furnace Granulated Slag (BFGS) ; after grinding to a speciﬁ c 
surface area of >4000 cm 2 /g, the slag powder has pozzolanic properties and is 
applied in concrete as a replacement of cement with higher application  value .

 Steel slags ratio is around 100–120 kg/t.Liq.Steel, which is a sum of de-S 
(actually, de-S slag is iron slag), de-C, de-P, de-Si slags, and cast residue. Normally, 
de-S slag associates with ~25 % of iron, and steel slag with 8–10 % steel. De-S slag 
is crushed and the iron content recovered by screening and magnetic separation. 
The steel and slag are bonded closely in steel slags, it needs further processing to 
recover the slag scrap. A steam box treatment by steam pressure has been developed 
in China and is widely applied in Chinese steel works; it is able to stabilize the free 
CaO and free MgO, and separate the steel and slag sufﬁ ciently, and allow recovery 
of a higher ratio of steel and make the slag tailings easy for resource use, such as 
application in steel slag cement. 
1.1.4.5  Others 
 There are some other reverts generated in iron and steel making processes, such as 
kish graphite, coke dry quench (CDQ) dust, coke water quench (CWQ) sludge, 
lubricant oil, and grease. If entrusted to a contractor to clean these reverts, this 
would become a cost burden. However, these reverts have valuable contents and 
should be recovered internally in steelworks to ﬁ t well with a Zero Waste policy. 
Table  1.4 shows typical chemical composition of reverts.

1.2  Introduction to Raw Materials Handling 
 Raw materials handling is like a relay station and the artery system in the human 
body for blood transport. The materials receiving, stocking, reclaiming, and con-
veying systems would be different depending on the locations and the production 
capacity of a steelworks. Recently, raw materials supply by maritime transport has 
become the major trend; more and more steelworks are moving to ocean adjacent 
areas to take advantage of the cost savings of having their own wharf and unloading 
system. This section will give a brief introduction to the unloading devices, stock 
yard operations, and the related conveying systems. 
1.2.1  Unloading and Conveying 
1.2.1.1  Unloaders 
 Different kinds of unloading devices have been developed to meet the raw materials 
characteristics, so as to discharge these materials most smoothly and within the 
shortest duration. A brief introduction of some common unloaders follows.
 Bucket Chain type: suitable for iron ore and coal unloading, designed for hard and 
heavy materials. 
 Screw Type: suitable for coal unloading, not suitable for iron ore. 
 Grab Type: suitable for iron ore, coal and ﬂ uxes. The unloading speed is low.

 Bucket-Chain CSU 
 There are two types of  Bucket-Chain CSU , one is catenary type (Fig.  1.1 ) without 
rigid support in the reclaiming section, where the hopper reaches onto the cargo 
surface and is able to adjust the angle when the waves are high, it also has the bot-
tom clearance ability.
 Another is  L-shaped chain bucket CSU (Fig.  1.2 ), where the reclaimer can be 
rotated, and the boom can be tilted with rotation. The reclaiming procedure can be 
automatically controlled. There is no up and down grabbing movement, and with a 
closing system, so the dust emission during unloading is much lower than with grab 
types. It is an environmentally friendly system.

16
 Screw Type CSU 
 The dispensing head of screw unloaders is inserted into the pile cabin; a reverse 
rotating reclaimer moves the materials into a vertical screw conveyor, and then 
uplifted to the horizontal screw conveyor, and eventually transported into the transit 
silo and discharge to the stock yard by conveying system (Fig.  1.3 ). The biggest 
advantage is the operation process in a closed system, without dust pollution, but the 
abrasion is severe for hard materials, and the energy consumption is even higher due 
to the sophisticated mechanical structure. It is mainly used for coal, cement, bulk 
grain, fertilizer, potash, and other bulk materials unloading.
 Grab Type Ship Unloader 
 The  grab type unloader (Fig.  1.4 ) has been wildly applied in recent decades, and it 
is the most popular unloading system being used. The advantage is the suitability 
for different kinds of materials, e.g., coal, iron ores, and ﬂ uxes. Low efﬁ ciency is 
the disadvantage due to the return bucket not holding any materials. In addition, 
dust emissions are generated when the grab opens to discharge the materials into the 
receiving hopper.
1.2.2  Conveyor 
 Conveyors are designed to meet the operational requirements, and the most popular 
types of conveyors used in steel works are (1) steel cord conveyor, (2) canvas con-
veyor, and (3) aramid conveyor.

1.2.2.1  Steel Cord Conveyor Belt 
 Steel cord conveyors are used for heavy loading transportation, or high ﬂ ow rate 
transportation. The advantages are superior impact resistance, excellent trough abil-
ity, low stretch, suitable for long-distance transportation, and long working life. The 
cross section is shown in Fig.  1.5 .
1.2.2.2  Canvas Conveyor Belt 
 Canvas conveyors are used in high moisture materials transportation, due to the 
high water prooﬁ ng characteristics. The durability is not as good as in steel cord 
conveyors. These are in less load transportation and low ﬂ ow rate conveying

systems. The advantages are highly waterproof, low stretch, high tensile strength, 
high impact resistance, better mildew and moisture resistance. A cross section of a 
canvas conveyor is  shown in Fig.  1.6 .
1.2.2.3  Aramid Conveyor Belt 
 These are conveyors made of synthetic polymers with rubber to provide exceptional 
strength and thermal stability. They are durable for corrosion and moisture resis-
tance, only the initial installation cost is higher than the other types of conveyors. 
The aramid conveyor features are superior impact resistance, corrosion and mois-
ture resistance, long lifetime, easy installation and maintenance, and easy for 
 recycling. The cross section of an aramid conveyor belt is shown in Fig.  1.7 . 
A comparison of different conveyors characteristics is presented in Table  1.5 .

1.2.3  Stock Yard 
 In order to balance the chemical composition and enhance mineral transformation 
during the  sintering process , normally, several kinds of iron ores are being used at 
one time. How to adjust the sinter ore blending ratio by “drawing the sturdy portion 
to offset the weaknesses” has become the operation ‘know how’ for every steel-
works. A preliminary experiment using a sinter pot test is conducted before choos-
ing the ore type and ratio, followed by the integrated production plan to arrange the 
shipment and stocking; eventually, these raw materials are purchased and stored in 
the stock yard. 
1.2.3.1  Open  Yard 
 The most popular stock yard is an  open yard . The materials with dense and coarse 
particles, resistant to wind blow and rainfall, are stocked in an open yard, but this 
would depend on the weather conditions. The excess or un-qualiﬁ ed sinter ores and 
coke are temporarily stocked in a dumping yard, which is ready to maintain the BF 
operation during the shutdown time of the sinter plant or coke oven. Figure  1.8 
shows the stock yard and S/R (stacker and reclaimer), Fig.  1.9 shows the coke 
dumping yard.
1.2.3.2  Indoor Yards 
 Indoor yards are normally installed in the windy and heavy rain areas, but recently, 
steelworks have been requested to install indoor yards to prevent dust emissions. 
Two major types of indoor yards have been introduced, one is dome shaped and the 
second is a strip type. Figures  1.10 and  1.11 show a dome type indoor yard, and 
Figs.  1.12 ,  1.13 , and  1.14 show the strip type indoor yard.

1.2.4  Blending Silo and  Blending Yard 
1.2.4.1  Blending Silos 
 There are different ore blending schemes, some steel works blend iron ores only in 
the blending yard, and others may mix with ﬂ uxes, reverts, or BF return ﬁ nes. 
However, the main purpose is to homogenize the ore mix and conform to the 
required chemical targets. 
 
 
1 Sinter Plant Operations: Raw Materials

22
 Each silo contains different ores, ﬂ uxes, reverts, or others; through the chemical 
calculation to set the discharging rate of each bin, these materials are fed to a main 
conveyor and send to the blending yard for blending. The numbers of silos and 
holding capacity will depend on the ore usage and sinter plant capacity. Figure  1.15 
shows the blending silos.
1.2.4.2  Blending Operations 
 Blending operations are to deploy these materials layer by layer through a walking 
stacker (Fig.  1.16 ), and reclaim the pile from cross section, Fig.  1.17 shows a roller 
drum type reclaimer.

1.2.5  Reverts Homogenization Plant 
 A reverts treatment system is essential in any steelworks, because many iron, car-
bon, or CaO bearing wastes are worth recovering and feeding back into the produc-
tion process. A reference typical Homogenization  Plan t is introduced in this section. 
A road map for reverts generation and utilization is shown in Fig.  1.18 .

 The basic ideas are as follows:
 1.  To remove alkali chloride elements from sinter plant EP dust by a stirring and 
washing system. This is a simple and easy method to depress PCDD/Fs forma-
tion by means of reducing Cl content, and also prevents the BF clogging by 
removal of low melting point alkaline salts;

 2.  To separate high-Zn content of BOF OG slurry by hydro-cyclone, the Zn source 
may be from the head or tail chopping waste of the galvanization line, or using 
the auto scrap in BOF; 
 3.  To remove the oil content from rolling mill pit scale by bubble ﬂ otation. The oil 
occurs in between the layers of the platy scale, these adhering scales have to be 
opened by strong bubble stirring and then remove the oil.  
 4.  The wet sludge and dry dust are then mixed by an intensiﬁ ed mixer, followed by 
a blending and aging treatment before being sent to the blending silo as raw 
materials for the sinter plant. The reason for aging is that some of the Fe 2+ or Fe 0 
in the waste should be changed into stable Fe(OH) 2 or Fe 2 O 3 to prevent the clog-
ging inside the silo.  
 The revert materials after removing the un-welcome elements, then, are classi-
ﬁ ed into wet and dry groups, the dry dusts are transferred by tank lorry and stocked 
in bins, the wet reverts (H 2 O <10 %) are transferred by truck and stocked in panel 
bunkers, where the sludges (H 2 O >30 %) are transferred by tank and stocked in  pits . 
 The key operational issues are to control the mixing reverts with the moisture 
content around 12 %, but having no water droplets fall out, and then feed into an 
intensiﬁ ed mixer before sending to the reverts blending pile. The deployed pile will 
be cured for about 1 week, with FeO or metal Fe becoming Fe(OH) 2 or/and Fe 2 O 3 
to avoid any clogging problem inside the blending bins. Revert mixture will be 
treated as one kind of materials to be used in sintering process. 
 Normally the ratios for wet and dry materials are not just made to balance the 
ﬁ nal moisture at 12 %; some iron rich tailings from converter slag, BF return ﬁ nes 
are used as the dry materials.

Abstract  This chapter is focused on the multiphase multicomponent model devel-
opment and prediction of common hazardous compounds produced during the 
industrial iron ore sintering process within an integrated steelworks. The iron ore 
sintering process is a key technology in the steel industry due to its possibility of 
recycling waste solids or powders internally produced during the raw materials han-
dling or subsequent process of steel production. However, this process is also rec-
ognized as one of the most critical unit with regard to the polychlorinated dioxins 
and furans (PCDD/F) emissions. In addition, as fossil fuels are used, the emissions 
of SOx and NOx are significant and must be strictly controlled. The process is 
dynamic and involves the cross flow of gas through the bed which can carry the fine 
particles. The outlet gas treatment involves the cleaning with electrostatic precipita-
tor and filter bags. New technologies, however, have been introduced in order to 
treat PCDD/F and SOx–NOx compounds, which introduce significant increase in the 
cost of the production. New process concepts and technologies have been proposed 
such as gas recycling, fuel gas injection, and biomasses fuels. However, testing 
these technologies are expensive. In this context, comprehensive mathematical 
models based on transport phenomena are efficient tools to study and indicate new 
possibilities for designing operational conditions as well as resizing the machines 
for minimizing the hazardous emissions. In this chapter, the model principles and 
analysis cases are presented and discussed. The impacts of four technological pro-
posal on the hazardous emissions of PCDD/F, NOx, SOx, and particulates are ana-

lyzed, as follows: (a) effect of fuel gas injection; (b) effect of gas recycling and 
oxygen injection; and (c) effect of using biomass and biogas replacing the fossil fuel 
(coke breeze). The analysis is carried out comparing the actual operation of the 
industrial iron ore sintering machine with the new concepts proposed based on their 
specific hazardous emissions.
2.1  Introduction
The iron ore sinter process plays an important role at the integrated steel plant furnishing 
suitable raw materials for the blast furnace and recycling the inner fine dust produced 
within the whole steelmaking facilities. The size and capacity of the sinter machines 
vary widely and are mainly limited by the air suction systems. Larger machines, how-
ever, present small ability to handle low-grade raw materials although high-energy effi-
ciencies are usually obtained. The small and compact machines are increasingly 
becoming attractive due to their ability to use different source of raw materials and low 
grade iron ores. The traditional sinter plant is composed of raw materials preparation, 
blowing and suction system, sinter strand, cleaning gas, cooling and sinter product clas-
sification. Figure 2.1 shows a schematic view of the sinter facilities.
In this study, the ignition furnace is modified and enlarged dividing ignition and 
gas burnout zones in order to allow gas fuel utilization and oxygen injection into 
five wind boxes length aiming to increase the sinter machine efficiency and decrease 
the emissions. The burner furnace is adapted to have two zones: (a) ignition zone 
using natural gas and (b) gas burner zone using steelmaking or biogas with oxygen 
enrichment. This concept is suitable for designing different gas utilization systems. 
The feeder system is adapted to have height control and allows bed adjustments 
with uniform distributions.

Many efforts have been made to develop new technologies aiming at decreasing 
the fossil fuels utilization due to the environmental restrictions and decrease the 
process carbon intensity (Oyama et al. 2011; Guilherme and Castro 2012). The pro-
cess is complex and involves various physical and chemical phenomena such as 
heat, mass, and momentum transfer coupled with chemical reactions (Yamaoka and 
Kawaguchi 2005; Castro et al. 2012a, b, 2013a, b; Ahan et al. 2013; Kasai et al. 
2005; Cumming and Thurlby 1990). These phenomena take place simultaneously 
increasing considerably the complexity of process analysis. Thus, an effective way 
of developing new concepts and their quantification is to develop comprehensive 
mathematical models capable of simultaneously considering the mass transfer using 
reliable rate equations for the chemical reactions, momentum transfer for complex 
bed structure and interphase heat transfer considering simultaneously convective, 
radiation and chemical reactions heat transfer. The proposal of this study is to adapt 
the actual sintering machine to improve the flexibility of the process and allow 
simultaneously operation with gas recycling, fuel gas utilization, operation with 
partial operation of mill scale and biomass together with fossil fuels as coke breeze 
or anthracite.
Figure 2.2 shows the new concept to attain these principles. As can be seen, the 
actual machine was modified adding new wind boxes and new furnaces and burn-
ers. Therefore, in the first furnace recycling gas can be used to pre-heat, water 
vaporization, calcination and transform partially the hematite to magnetite recovery 
the energy of the gas. The second furnace can be used to injection of fuel gas and 
oxygen at the region where in the traditional operation presents a deficit of heat and 
oxygen and consequently non-uniform sinter formation. Thus, with this compara-
tively small investment the process could be improved largely from the point of 
view of environmental impact and energy savings.

2.2  Theory
A mathematical model based on a set of partial differential equations represents the 
conservations of momentum, energy, and chemical species for gas, solid (raw mate-
rial mix and solidified liquid), and melting phases. The domain is restricted to the 
control volume of the moving strand with the gas passing transversely through the 
bed, as shown in Fig. 2.2a, b.
The set of differential equations, Eqs. (2.1)–(2.4), are solved using the boundary 
conditions that represent the process of gas suction and solid inflow, as well as the 
heat losses to the environment by convections and radiation processes. The numeri-
cal solution is obtained by using the finite volume method based on the power law 
scheme to compute the algebraic coefficients and the SIMPLE (Semi Implicit 
Method for Pressure Linked Equations) algorithm to resolve the velocity compo-
nents and pressure simultaneously in a staggered non-uniform grid (Melaen 1992). 
Additional relations accounting for interphase momentum and energy transfer are 
presented in Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6), while Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8) stand for the effects of 
the softening and melting properties of the raw materials, which strongly effects the 
bed permeability, heat and mass transfer.

The thermo-physical properties of each phase thermal conductivity (k), heat 
capacity (Cp), viscosity (μ), and specific mass (ρ) are composition and temperature 
dependent. The symbols εg and εs stand for the individual solid and gas volume frac-
tions, while ds is the single particle diameter, Sm is the shrinkage melting down fac-
tor, and Tm is the initial softening and melting temperature. These parameters are 
obtained using standard softening and melting experiment for the raw materials 
(Nogueira and Fruehan 2006; Castro et al. 2013a, b). In this study, the raw materials 
used are listed in Table 2.1 with their respective composition. The chemical reac-
tions that take place within the sinter bed involve gas and solid reactions. The water 
vaporization, partial softening, and melt and solidification are assumed to be con-
trolled by the heat supply and cooling rates, while the combustion, reduction, and 
oxidation are assumed temperature and gas composition dependent. The rate equa-
tions for such mechanisms can be found elsewhere (Omori 1987; Castro et  al. 
2012a, b, 2013a, b; El-Hussiny et al. 2015; Lu et al. 2013). The NOx and SOx forma-
tion mechanisms take into account the oxygen potential and the temperature depen-
dency of the rate equations. The PCDD/F net formation use a two steps mechanism 
of solid surface adsorption and decomposition and formation during cooling which 
depends on the local gas composition and temperature. The effect of raw materials 
composition is included on the rate equations based on empirical data (Mitterlehner 
et al. 2004; Kasai et al. 2005; Castro et al. 2013a, b; Kasama et al. 2006).
2.3  Results and Discussions
The proposal of the technological feasibility of the new concepts is analyzed using 
the multiphase multicomponent mathematical model. Base cases using actual oper-
ational data are used to model validation and verification on the compact machine

operating with coke breeze, granular biomass, and coke oven gas. In the following 
cases are considered the gas recycling, biomass and biogas utilization as well as 
oxygen addition on the post ignition chamber.
2.3.1  Model Verification
Figure 2.3 shows the new machine configuration and the temperature distribution for 
the gas phase using coke breeze as solid fuel. As can be observed, the temperature 
distribution shows a typical combustion front and cooling zones indicating feasible 
operation. Figure 2.4 shows the comparison of coke breeze, granular biomass, and 
fuel gas utilization. It is important to emphasize that the calorific heat values were 
used to determine the substitution factor of the fossil fuel by biomass and biogas aim-
ing at recovering the energy input on the sintering zone. However, it is also important 
to point out that for biogas and biomass the fuel is renewable energy sources.
Figure 2.4 shows a comparison of the average temperatures measured and pre-
dicted by the model at the wind boxes channel using the new machine concept 
operating with coke breeze as solid fuel, granular biomass, and fuel gas with oxygen 
injection into the second burner chamber furnace. As can be observed, the average 
temperatures calculated at the outlet of the wind boxes entering into the suction 
channels of the wind boxes agreed well with the measured ones. The measured and 
calculated temperature demonstrated that for gaseous fuel utilization and oxygen 
injection on the second chamber covering win boxes 8–12 the outlet temperature 
of  the gas is significantly shifted up compared with the coke breeze operation. 
The granular biomass operation with fuel adjustment on the sintering mixture based 
on the calorific values differences of the solid fuels presented similar pattern with

machine design (fossil fuel operation—coke breeze)—base case

the thermal front shift back due to the higher reactivity of the granular biomass in 
comparison with the coke breeze. As a general trend, however, the model and mea-
sured values obtained by thermocouples positioned at the wind boxes suction outlet 
agreed very well and comparisons based on the simulation results could be obtained.
2.3.2  New Technologies Based on Fossil Fuels
In this section, new technologies using the modified sintering machine are consid-
ered. Scenarios of coke breeze solid fuel are compared with partial substitution by 
coke oven gas and process gas recycling. In order to illustrate the changes of the inner 
bed temperature distributions, Figs. 2.5 and 2.6 are shown. As can be seen, the tem-
perature distributions and the thermal front zone significantly changes when fuel gas 
is used into the second chamber comprising the wind boxes length of 9–12 (WB9–
WB12) and the product gas of the wind boxes (WB16–WB20) are recirculated to the 
first chamber which comprises the wind boxes length WB1–WB7 of the machine.
2.3.3  New Technologies Based on Biomass and Biogas 
Operations (Renewable Fuels)
In this section, new technologies based on renewable energy sources are summa-
rized and analyzed using the multiphase multicomponent model developed by 
Castro et al. (2012a, b, 2013a, b). Previous results indicated that one severe short-
comings limiting the solid fuel operation leading to considerable generation of 
return sinter is a deficit of heat at the beginning of the combustion front.

granular biomass, and fuel gas operations

34
The technologies based on fuel gas and oxygen injection within a post ignition 
chamber overcomes this limitation and drastically decreased the returned sinter pro-
moting uniform heat distribution along the bed height. Figure 2.7 demonstrates this 
operation comparing with the actual operation technique. As can be observed, the 
operation with the post ignition chamber of fuel gas and oxygen furnishes addi-
tional heat on the surface of the sinter bed and significantly enlarges the sintering 
zone besides allowing narrow control of the temperature.

tion in the post ignition chamber, and process gas recycling of the first six wind boxes

35
The concerns with regard to the new technologies are mostly due to the environ-
mental impacts compared with the traditional ones. Table 2.2 shows the main envi-
ronmental parameters for the new technologies and the traditional operation. Cases 
based on fossil fuels and renewable fuels were compared based on the emissions 
parameters. Regarding to carbon intensity case 2 for fossil fuels where coke oven gas 
and oxygen injection showed the best results. The scenarios of renewable fuels com-
bining granular biomass, biogas with oxygen on the post ignition chamber combining

with the process gas recycling of wind boxes (WB16–WB20) into wind boxes  
(WB1–WB7) showed the best combination. For these best configurations, the 
­emissions of particulates slightly decreased.
The emissions of SOx drastically decreased for the cases of renewable fuels, 
while NOx did not changed substantially indicating that the raw materials purities 
play the major role. The PCDD/F emissions strongly depends on the raw materials 
and the residency time of the process on the temperature range of 250–450 °C. As 
can be seen, the emissions of polychlorinated substances slightly decreased for the 
biomass and biogas utilization. Figures 2.8 and 2.9 show the inner bed PCDD/F

concentration distribution in the gas phase for the best cases analyzed of fossil fuels 
and renewable ones. As can be seen, the PCDD/F recycled into the gas in the first 
wind boxes are adsorbed into the bed at the lower temperature region and are 
released at the higher temperature zone where are partially destroyed and partly 
incorporated into the outflow gas.
2.4  Conclusions
A comprehensive mathematical model able to simulate a fuel flex compact sintering 
machine is proposed. The model is used to investigate feasible operations based on 
biomass, biogas, and steelmaking fuel gas together with process gas recycling. 
Simulation results indicated that feasible operation conditions could be obtained 
using 100 % of biomass fuel in a shorter machine with faster strand velocity due to 
higher combustibility of the granular biomass and biogas. Oxygen enrichment with 
fuel gas is recognized as an effective technology for reducing returned sinter and 
improve the strand productivity producing uniform sinter quality along the bed 
height. Regarding SOx emissions the raw materials play the main role (mainly coke 
breeze and steelmaking gas). The 100 % of biomass and biogas reduced above 90 % 
of the SOx emissions with negligible improvement on the particulate emissions. 
PCDD/F emissions are decreased for all gas recycling tested technology, but when 
dust fines are used the specific emissions increased as the percentage of fines is 
increased. The NOx emissions are mainly affected by the combustion oxidizing con-
ditions within the flame front. The results indicated that coke oven gas fuel utiliza-
tion enhanced the NOx emissions assuming the same raw materials and conversely 
the biogas and biomass decreased the specific emissions (see Table 2.2).

 Dangerous Emissions Control and Reduction 
in Sinter Plants  
 Pasquale  Cavaliere and  Angelo  Perrone 
 Abstract    Sintering operations in steelmaking is one of the main sources of production 
of PCDD (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins), PCDF (polychlorinated dibenzo-
furans), NOx, and SOx. The precise operating conditions through which a reduction 
of greenhouse emissions is described and analyzed by experimental- numerical 
approach. The goal is the recognition of optimized design as a function of the strong 
reduction of dioxins, furans, NOx, and SOx coupled with high productivity of the 
plant. Following the proposed approach, it was possible to reduce the emissions close 
to the legal limits with a high level of productivity and efﬁ ciency of the plant.

3.1.1  Process Description 
 Ironmaking and steelmaking are a highly material- and energy-intensive industrial 
operations. More than half of the mass input becomes outputs in the form of  off- gases 
and solid wastes/by-products  . The most dangerous emissions are those to air. Those 
from sinter plants dominate the overall emissions for most of the pollutants. The sin-
tering of raw material is certainly one of the top steps in the steelmaking process for 
the production of steel components. Sinter plants agglomerate iron ore ﬁ nes (dust) 
with other ﬁ ne materials at high temperature, to create a product that can be used in a 
blast furnace. The ﬁ nal product, a sinter, is a small, irregular nodule of iron mixed 
with small amounts of other minerals. The process, called sintering, causes the con-
stituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the  chemi-
cal properties of the ingredients. The purpose of sinter is to be used converting iron 
into steel. Iron ore ﬁ nes, other iron-bearing wastes, and coke dust are blended and 
combusted. The process of sintering to improve the physical and chemical properties 
of iron ore for use in blast furnaces is well documented (Nakano et al.  2009 ; Senk 
et al.  2006 ; Aries et al.  2006 ; Xhrouet and De Pauw  2004 ). The raw material for the 
production of iron and steel is made from solid oxides that are found in different lay-
ers of the earth’s crust and that are extracted in huge quantities in order to be used in 
different stages of the metallurgical process. The compounds most exploited are gen-
erally  metal oxides   (micaceous iron, hematite, magnetite), hydrated oxides (limonite), 
carbonates (siderite), and sulﬁ des (pyrite). The agglomeration process gives rise to 
many different physical and chemical phenomena. The process was largely explained 
by the authors (Cavaliere and Perrone  2013 ). Sintering, as already explained above, is 
a process that needs high temperatures that are always lower than the melting point of 
the crude; moreover we cannot forget the aspects related to the oxygen, carbon diox-
ide, and carbon monoxide level that inﬂ uence the transformation; the same reasoning 
should also be done for the humidity level, the ﬂ ow of intake air, the percentages of 
coke, and anthracite entered to get the mixture to be treated; furthermore, the choice 
of the raw material to be machined and the percentage of oxides, silicates, and sulﬁ des 
of different nature that are pushed onto the conveyor belt into the furnace can change 
the mode the way in which the metallurgical process develops. 
 Many theories try to explain what really happens to the individual grains in these 
working conditions, and although they are debated in a large number of  scientiﬁ c

journals and numerous conference, in the end this process is still largely unknown. 
With regard to our work, it can be stated that we observed the development of a dif-
fusion process that kicks off on the contact surfaces between two different grains 
and leads to their growth and compaction. Consequently a recrystallization of the 
grains and the decrease of porosity (i.e., the percentage of free volume) is observed. 
 An energy balance that pushes the particles toward the compaction is at basis of this 
transformation. Increasing the temperature, the crude loses the optimal conditions of 
equilibrium, as it has an excess of free energy due to the presence of numerous voids. 
At high temperatures, diffusion processes are activated in the material; they allow that 
given quantity of particles moves from the outside to the internal areas of the crude 
going to ﬁ ll the voids. In this way, the overall volume is reduced, and consequently, 
there is an increase of the density. Therefore, the blocks are more compact. 
 The process is set up in a way that it is completed at the end of the  agglomeration 
machine where the coke has to be completely combusted. The agglomeration pro-
cess leads to a number of physical and chemical phenomena. During the cooking, 
the following main steps can be distinguished:
•  Around 100 °C, drying of the mixture; at higher temperatures, the water of crys-
tallization is removed. 
•  Between 600 and 800 °C, the ﬁ rst agglomeration of ﬁ ne particles into a porous 
material takes place and the swelling grains adhere weakly to each other. 
•  More than 1000 °C, the grains soften, and we can see the same physical and 
chemical conditions that lead to the completion of the agglomeration process.  
 At the end of the grate, a sinter breaker is placed. It reduces the sintered material to the 
desired size (Anderson and Fisher  2002 ). Here PCDD/Fs form in the presence of carbon-
containing materials (Ryan and Altwicker  2004 ; Tsubouchi et al.  2006 ); the process is 
favored by the presence of speciﬁ c organic compounds or a carbonaceous matrix-sand 
sources of chlorine and oxygen, plus increased temperatures (200–800 °C, at higher tem-
peratures PCDD/Fs will rapidly decompose). It was observed that the presence of cata-
lytic metals (Cu) can be essential at modest temperatures (Kawaguchi et al.  2002 ). In the 
sinter bed, basically three layers can be recognized: raw material (wet and cold), the 
burning front, and the cooldown zone, consisting of sintered material. In this region, the 
 products of incomplete combustion (PICs) surviving the heat of the burning front may 
condense, while the temperature is high enough to enable reactions with species in the 
raw materials acting as catalysts. Also, the native carbon-containing materials may react 
via the so-called de novo route. Obviously, during sintering, conditions are encountered 
wherein dioxins can be formed and for some part survive (Cieplik et al.  2003 ).  
3.1.2  Emissions Formation 
 The  gas temperature inside the wind box and wind legs is lower (100–500 °C) with 
respect to the sintering grate; such conditions lead to the optimal physical and 
chemical conditions for the formation of pollutants such as PCDD/F, NOx, and SOx 
(Iosif et al.  2008 ).  Polychlorinated dibenzo-dioxins (PCDD) and  polychlorinated 
3 Dangerous Emissions Control and Reduction in Sinter Plants

42
dibenzo-furans (PCDF) are persistent stable organic pollutants formed in all those 
high temperature processes with abundance of organic material in presence of chlo-
rine and copper. Dioxins and furans are chlorinated tricyclic organic compounds 
resulting from the combination of organic compounds impregnated with halogens 
(i.e., ﬂ uorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) with a speciﬁ c molecular heterocyclic 
structure (Menad et al.  2006 ). A deep and complete thermodynamic description of 
the PCDD/Fs formation has been presented in literature by Tan et al. ( 2001 ). These 
compounds are commonly grouped under the name “dioxins,” but their chemical 
structures and their properties can be very different. 
 Dioxins are a class of  heterocyclic organic compounds whose basic structure 
consists of rings with four carbon atoms and two oxygen atoms. On the other hand, 
furans have only one oxygen atom, and the two outer benzene rings are linked by a 
pentagonal structure. Among the 200 types of known dioxins, the most famous are 
certainly the PCDD, characterized by the presence of chlorine atoms that will com-
plement the aromatic rings. The chemical stability of such compounds derives from 
the presence of these rings that make it resistant throughout. The most dangerous of 
dioxins, for serious problems of bioaccumulation and environmental contamina-
tion, is certainly TCDD. 
 A detailed description of their formation is presented in literature (Kulkarni et al. 
 2008 ; Raghunatan and Gullet  1996 ; Suzuki et al.  2004 ). The PCDD are generally 
measured in terms of toxicity equivalent (TEQ) relative to TCDD as a reference, 
being the most polluting and dangerous. The poly dibenzo-dioxins have different tox-
icities in relation to their structure. TEQ expresses the quantity of a “toxic” substance 
as the concentration of the reference substance that can generate the same toxic effects 
of TCDD. It is also possible to obtain the concentration of a PCDD with its toxic 
equivalency through the use of  toxic equivalency factor (TEF) . The TEF for TCDD is 
assigned equal to one, while the other dioxins have a factor less than one. This dimen-
sionless parameter, multiplied by the actual concentration, results in the TEQ. 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has identiﬁ ed the 7 most toxic PCDDs and 
the 10 most toxic PCDFs, giving them an international toxic equivalency factor (Eq.  3.1 ):

3.2  Experimental-Numerical Approach 
 The analysis of the sintering process was performed on a sintering plant belonging 
to an  Italian steel company (Dwight-Lloyd sinter). For the development of such 
analysis, the emission levels of a period of 6 years and the corresponding inputs 
have been recorded to deﬁ ne the starting point of the problem. The corresponding 
productivity of the plant and the quality of the sintered material have been taken into 
account for comparison. The main goal is the reduction of dangerous emissions 
coupled with acceptable levels of productivity and quality of the material.

43
 Each windbox was equipped with  thermocouples (k-type) in order to monitor the 
off-gas temperature during sintering. The ﬂ ue gases composition was monitored, 
according to EN1948 parts 2 and 3, EN-1948SS (sampling standards, Wellington 
Laboratories EN-1948ES (extraction standards, Wellington Laboratories), and 
EN-1948IS (injection standards, Wellington Laboratories), by employing a high- 
resolution gas chromatograph and a high-resolution selective mass detector. 
 The  output variables (PCDD/F, NOx, and SOx) deﬁ ne a multigoal analysis and 
have been minimized, taking into account some constraints or limitations typical of 
the actual process of sintering. 
 In order to obtain a strong optimization and control of the industrial operations 
in sintering ore plants, different models were proposed and are available in litera-
ture, and many of those models refer to experiments performed on laboratory scale 
(Thurlby et al.  1979 ; Kucukada et al.  1994 ; Cross and Blot  1999 ; Young et al.  1979 ; 
Pomerleau et al.  2003 ). 
 In the present study, a model belonging to a multi-objective optimization analy-
sis has been carried out from data belonging to a real industrial plant. 
 The sintering process is outlined in the workﬂ ow through the analysis carried out 
by  modeFRONTIER , as shown in Fig.  3.1 .
 The workﬂ ow is divided into data ﬂ ow (solid line) and logic ﬂ ow (dotted line) 
which have a common node, the calculator node in which mathematical functions 
and chemical reactions representative of the process are introduced. In the data ﬂ ow,

all the input parameters are grouped; such input parameters should be optimized 
during numerical simulations as a function of the multi-objectives (in the present 
case the reduction of emissions). In the present case, the following input parameters 
are considered and then introduced:
 –  Number of the  windbox : progressive value that indicates in which windbox there 
was a known level of emissions 
 –  Gas temperatures in the wind box and wind leg 
 –  Percentage of O 2 , CO 2 , CO, Moi inside the windbox that affects the development 
of PCDD/F 
 –  Exit gas rate: expressed in meters per second. It appears to be an important 
parameter because it deﬁ nes how long the gas remains within the wind box. 
 –  Cl and Cu: both elements improve the production of PCDD/F, although in differ-
ent ways. Chlorine is a key component of the structure of PCDD/F, and depend-
ing on the number of atoms on the rings, it deﬁ nes the hazards and toxicity. 
Copper is a strong catalyst and thus fosters a series of chemical reactions, leading 
to the development of PCDD/F (Tan and Neuschutz  2004 ; Ogawa et al.  1996 ). 
 –  Addition of S, according to the following three ways: through gas SO 2 added to 
the combustion gases, by the addition of coal containing sulfur with more impact 
than the previous case of pollutants SO 2 , in the form of sulfur-based reagents 
added to the crude oil (Ogawa et al.  1996 ). 
 –  Addition of urea, which has a dual effect of inhibition: it can act on the urea 
functional groups by blocking some surface complexes and thereby reducing the 
availability of catalytic metal sites and can coat the surface of the particulates 
and prevent chemical reactions (Boscolo and Padoano  2008 ). 
 –  Addition of hydrated lime: capable of increasing the economic productivity of 
sintering; it is demonstrated to be a good suppressor of PCDD/F (Chen et al. 
 2009 ; Kurkin et al.  2007 ). Normally HCl reacts with oxygen to form water and 
Cl 2 . The lime reduces the atmosphere of chlorination by setting HCl in CaCl 2 
which has the lowest vapor pressure between the various metal chlorides 
(Boscolo and Padoano  2011 ). 
3.3  Results and Discussion 
 Before starting to analyze the results of numerical simulation, the inﬂ uence of input 
parameters should be evaluated. Concerning the gas temperature in windbox and 
windleg, it must be noted that their trends are very similar and differ only from 30 
to 50 °C; the last box can reach even higher temperatures, up to 500–550 °C; from 
deep numerical analysis belonging to experimental setup of the plant, many funda-
mental results have been obtained in terms of input parameters (in a broad range of 
existence) inﬂ uencing the dioxin and NOx and SOx emissions. 
 Dioxin emission shows a maximum in the  windbox 19 , in the temperature range 
of 350–480 °C (Fig.  3.2a ); it increases also with increasing O 2 content up to very 
high levels (Fig.  3.2b ); from the graph, it is clear how the emissions are very 
sensitive to such parameters.

 To obtain a sintered material of uniform quality, it is necessary to schedule  heat-
ing and cooling on the grate in order to ensure that the thermal history of all the 
components is the same. This leads to the perfect control of temperature on the 
grate, taking into account that at temperatures below the red heat, the main mecha-
nism of heating is through convection and conduction, while at higher temperatures, 
the main mechanism is radiation, such behavior is strongly related to the gas ﬂ ow 
rate in the windboxes, and consequently the gas ﬂ ow rate deeply inﬂ uences the 
ﬁ nale quality of sintered grains. Many elements and compounds are very active in 
dioxins formation, and, in particular, they lead to an increase in the levels of danger-
ous emissions; Cu and Cl lead to a strong increase in the levels of dioxins emissions 
as shown in Fig.  3.5 . 
 Dioxin reaches highest values for high temperature and high  moisture presence 
(Fig.  3.3a ). In such conditions, also the CO 2 formation reaches its maximum values 
(Fig.  3.3b ).

 Dioxin emissions reach high values for high levels of  ﬂ ow rate in the windboxes 
(Fig.  3.4a ); as shown in Fig.  3.4b , high values of dioxin correspond to low values of 
carbon monoxide. On the contrary, the addition of urea and CaCO 3 leads to a strong 
efﬁ ciency in dioxins emission reduction (Figs.  3.5 and  3.6 ).
 Actually, also the  NOx and SOx emissions were monitored during the present 
study, all the input parameters previously analyzed inﬂ uence such emissions levels, 
and often the trend of reduction does not follow the dioxins one. 
 As shown in Fig.  3.7 , for example, the addition of urea leads to a decrease in 
dioxin level, but, at the same time, such reduction of dioxin coincides with an 
increase in NOx levels. The inﬂ uence of urea is very important in the reduction of 
polluting emission. In particular, the emission levels are reduced as the urea levels 
increase. For the PCDD/F, it occurs by means of a physical deposition or by poison-
ing the catalytic sites.

 Another strong example is represented by the addition of sulfur; it is very efﬁ -
cient in reducing the dioxin emissions (Fig.  3.8a ) but at the same time produces a 
strong increase in SOx emissions (Fig.  3.8b ). The role of sulfur in the reduction of 
emissions in the sintering can be noted. In all three ways previously observed, there 
has been a reduction of PCDD/F, especially in the second case, and it is probably 
due to the presence of SOx in the ﬂ ue gas. It is believed that these sulﬁ des can be 
converted to SO 2 , reducing the chlorine in HCl.

 The importance of lime in the reduction of  PCDD/F has been largely outlined in 
the present paper. The emissions levels are reduced as the lime quantity in the raw 
materials increases. The lime also brings to a strong reduction of SOx and a moder-
ate reduction of NOx. 
 Although the resultant optimal combination of input parameters is able to reduce 
the dangerous emissions from the plant, it is very important to examine the impact 
of the chosen input parameters on the sinter productivity. As a matter of fact, many 
different studies were performed on the  productivity measurements for selected 
designs with controlled levels of dioxin and NOx and SOx emissions. 
 As shown in Fig.  3.9 , high levels of dioxin emissions are found in correspon-
dence of very low levels of productivity, and then productivity increases with 
increasing dioxins and then increases with decreasing dioxin emissions (Fig.  3.9a ). 
By analyzing also the oxygen addition, it can be concluded that a decrease in O 2 
shifts the same productivity to lower dioxin emissions (Fig.  3.9b ).

 Actually,  temperature and oxygen ﬂ ow inﬂ uences moisture behavior in the sinter 
bed, and, as explained later in the paper, it is strongly related to the quality of the 
sinter; all the input parameter ranges were set in order to ﬁ x the quality of the pallets 
at a well-known level. High levels of productivity and low levels of dioxins can be 
reached with high level of moisture (Fig.  3.10a ), and high levels of gas ﬂ ow rate 
lead to an increase of productivity but unfortunately to an increase in dioxin emis-
sions (Fig.  3.10b ). Such parameter results are very important because it is strongly 
linked to the sinter permeability which can be directly related to the ore quality in 
terms of granule size and distribution, such parameter was taken strongly into 
account during the deﬁ nition of the parameter ranges in order to set an acceptable 
pellets quality for all the analyzed input conditions. Also moisture strongly inﬂ u-
ences the sinter quality because it is strongly related to voidance, and also the range 
of such parameter was set to ﬁ x a given range of the product quality. Generally, low 
levels of moisture lead to a decrease in the spread of granule size distribution and to 
an increase in the spherical aspect of the product, such behavior leads to a material 
with improved voidance and consequently to good levels of productivity. In the 
conditions of higher levels of moisture, normally the sinter thickness decreases, and 
this leads to a tendency for voidance to decrease; in this way, the productivity tends 
to decrease.
 Very low levels of dioxin and productivity are in correspondence oh high emis-
sions of  SOx and NOx (Fig.  3.11 ).
 Actually, just focusing on the SOx and NOx levels as a function of productivity, 
it can be underlined how many input parameters play a key role in the overall 
behavior of the plant. 
 To obtain high levels of productivity and low SOx and NOx emissions, tempera-
ture plays a fundamental role (Fig.  3.12 ).
 For all the productivity levels shown by the plant, the SOx and NOx levels can 
be reduced by reducing the oxygen ﬂ ux (Fig.  3.13 ). In each case, from the previous 
analysis, it can be concluded that the effect of such input parameters leads to an 
effect on  NOx and SOx emissions in a different way, and if they lead to a decrease

in NOx, they produce an increase in SOx and vice versa, so the control of input 
parameters should be tuned in order to reach an optimum point of acceptable diox-
ins NOx and SOx levels coupled with input and operative conditions, maintaining 
good levels of productivity.
 Another example is represented by the moisture effect; to reach good levels of 
productivity with low limits of SOx, NOx, it is necessary to ﬁ x lower levels of mois-
ture (Fig.  3.14 ).
 The increase of gas ﬂ ow rate leads to an increase in SOx levels, while it leads to 
a decrease in NOx levels for all the values of productivity measured in the present 
study (Fig.  3.15 ). The effect on  S addition on SOx and productivity and the effect of 
urea addition on NOx and productivity are shown in Fig.  3.16 .
 By increasing the lime content, it is possible to reach good values of productivity 
and, at the same time, to reduce the dioxin emissions (Fig.  3.17a ).  Lime is very 
effective in improving productivity with contemporary reduction of SOx emissions

53
(Fig.  3.17b ); the addition of lime leads to a moderate reduction of NOx for a given 
value of productivity (Fig.  3.17c ). It is fundamental to underline that the quality of 
the sinter is inversely proportional to lime grain size; in the present study, a grain 
size dimension, individuated as optimal from previous studies, has been used in all 
the experiments.
 By employing the so-called  correlation matrix  , it allows to immediately rec-
ognize how much the different variables are correlated between them; actually 
the parameters are strongly correlated if the corresponding value in the table is 
distant from zero in a range between −1 and 1; if the value is 1, the parameters 
are directly correlated, while if the value is −1, the parameters are inversely cor-
related. An example for the present study is given in Fig.  3.18 . From such 
matrix, it is also possible to observe the different weights of all the parameters; 
the more the value differs from 0, the more it inﬂ uences the corresponding vari-
able. For example, there is a direct strong correlation between temperature, 
moisture, oxygen, and ﬂ ow rate, while there is no relationship between the addi-
tion of elements and compounds to the raw material and the gas ﬂ ow rate, posi-
tion in the bed, and temperature.
 For the  output variables , it can be underlined that temperature, S, and potion of 
the windbox are directly related to SOx and urea, moisture CO, and CO 2 are 
inversely proportional to NOx. Temperature is proportional to dioxin, while ﬂ ow 
rate, moisture, O 2 , CO, and CO 2 are inversely proportional to such emissions. 
Focusing on the effect of the different input parameters on the sinter quality, we 
can summarize that:

 –  Flow rate is related to carbon monoxide and dioxide and consequently the 
combustion behavior with large inﬂ uence on sinter strength, aspect, and void-
ance; it is related to moisture that strongly inﬂ uences the quality parameters as 
largely indicated in the further discussion.  
 –  Temperature strongly inﬂ uences almost the main parameters with a strong effect 
on the sinter quality. 
 The range of existence of any  input parameters is characterized by chemical and 
physical constraints that have to be respected to obtain realistic results from the 
analysis. For example, gas temperature in the windbox has to be higher than 450–
500 °C because at this point, PCDD/Fs begin to decompose; but at the same time, 
the temperature should not increase too much because in this way the process would 
become too expensive. 
 Cu and Cl have to be reduced, but there is a physical and technological constraint 
that has to be respected by limiting the reduction of such elements in raw material. 
Urea, sulfur, and hydrated lime lead to a reduction of emissions, but too large an 
amount of these leads to deterioration of the mechanical and technological proper-
ties of the sintered material. If the sulfur percentage rises, the amount of SOx 
increases. For this reason, some designs have been excluded from the analysis. 
 During the  preliminary analysis of the training database, the windbox with the 
highest level of emissions was noted to be number 19. So the ﬁ rst analysis was per-
formed only on the said windbox to look for a set of values to be assigned to the 
different parameters in order to reduce the production of PCDD/F, NOx, and SOx. 
The optimum designs are summarized in Table  3.1 .
 It should be put in evidence that in all these cases there are high values of oxy-
gen, while those of monoxide and carbon dioxide are relatively low, as well as the 
level of moisture. 
 The  gas temperatures in the windbox turn out high; the chlorine and copper value 
is low, while the levels of additives cover upper-middle values. Maximum emis-
sions of SOx and NOx are found respectively in windbox 17 and 7. When sulfur 
rises, the level of SOx emissions increases, while the increasing of the lime addition 
leads to a reduction in the levels of NOx and PCDD/F emissions. At this point, the 
best operating conditions of all the 21 windboxes of the system were ﬁ xed, and the 
medium value, weighed in the three different cases, was estimated. Some parame-
ters, such as lime, sulfur, urea, chlorine, and copper, remain similar for all the 21 
windboxes, while the remaining input (temperatures, moisture, oxygen, etc.) assume 
different values according to the position in the sintering bed (Cavaliere et al.  2011 ). 
 In all three cases, the medium values of emissions of SOx and NOx are largely 
below the legal limit. Unfortunately, with such operating conditions, the PCDD/F 
levels exceed the value limit of 0.4 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 . Besides offering the minimal 
value in the optimization regarding windbox 19, design 1 proposes valid operating 
conditions for the whole system and the lowest values of pollutants. In order to 
deﬁ ne the optimization strategy, reference to  design 1 was chosen. The process 
parameters that result independent from the position on the belt conveyor were 
ﬁ xed. They are shown in the Table  3.2 .

3 Dangerous Emissions Control and Reduction in Sinter Plants

 For remaining process parameters, the choice of the values to apply to the single 
windbox is necessary. The results offered from the ﬁ rst phase of optimization were 
not followed because the proposed proﬁ les are discontinuous and inhomogeneous, 
difﬁ cult to apply to a real system. Therefore, another set of more homogenous pro-
ﬁ les was proposed, taking into account the data of the ﬁ rst phase of analysis, deﬁ ned 
new design. At last, the temperatures of the windboxes and  windlegs for the new 
design were chosen and shown in the Table  3.3 .
 With these values attributed to the input variables, the minimum value of emis-
sions obtained can be discovered. In Table  3.4 the results of the different designs are 
compared.
   Some of the optimal operating conditions were removed in favor of proﬁ les 
easier to apply to the system. In addition it was possible to obtain a value of pro-
ductivity close to 30 in agreement with the  industrial desires  . Consequently an 
increase of the medium levels of emissions can be expected. In fact the level of 
PCDD/F was found to vary from 0.43 to 0.45 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 , with also a contem-
porary increase of NOx and SOx. With the exception of the latter, the PCDD/F 
still exceeded the legal limits. Despite an increase of emissions, the application of 
the set of parameters of the New Design was chosen because technologically sim-
pler to realize. In addition it was possible to obtain a value of productivity close 
to 30 in agreement with the industrial desires.

 This study made it possible to implement a setting of the system through which 
it is possible to obtain a clean reduction of the emissions of polluting substances. 
Thus, just acting on input parameters, all the values of  PCDD/F below the legal 
limit were not possible to achieve. A further possible improvement was studied that 
consists in the application of a determined ﬁ ltered device that can carry to a further 
reduction of pollutants (Cavaliere et al.  2011 ). In the authors of the previous chap-
ter, such further reduction was strongly underlined, and in the present study, the 
attention was focused on the coupling between a decrease in dangerous emission 
and an acceptable productivity of the plant.  
3.4  Conclusions 
 The crucial aspects related to dioxins emissions and plant productivity of the iron 
ore sintering process are underlined in the present work. The study outlines the 
inﬂ uence of different parameters affecting it in order to establish a set of operating 
conditions capable of reducing the dangerous emissions. The way to tackle the 
problem consists in using numerical multi-objective optimization software mode-
FRONTIER with which to deﬁ ne optimal operating conditions. The analysis led to 
the deﬁ nition of a series of three best design practices that lead to lower emissions. 
Since these results are obtained in dangerous working conditions, they represented 
the starting point necessary to deﬁ ne a particular setting of the system technologi-
cally easier to reproduce. A large attention was put on the analysis of the reduction 
of dangerous emissions coupled with an acceptable level for productivity. All the 
input parameters, before the optimization, were chosen in order to fall in a range, 
guaranteeing an acceptable quality of the sintered material in terms of dimension, 
sphericity, and voidance. The productivity of the plant, resulting from the chosen 
optimal input parameters, showed no signiﬁ cant differences from the required ones. 
The results conﬁ rmed the applicability of the obtained optimal conditions for the 
ordinary industrial production.

 Abstract   The sintering process is an important part of iron and steel production. In 
the process of sintering, large amounts of SOx, NOx, HF, dioxins, particulate mat-
ters and other gaseous pollutants are produced. In order to control the sintering ﬂ ue 
gas pollutants, the emission standard for iron and steeling sintering ﬂ ue gas in China 
was published in 2012 and the control application of source, process and end treat-
ment were applied. Based on a systematic description of relevant puriﬁ cation tech-
nologies, this chapter reviews the current situation for control of sintering ﬂ ue gas 
in China and the trend of technology development. Aplication cases are described, 
with the purpose of providing an important reference for the choice of sintering ﬂ ue 
gas emission control technology for domestic and international steel corporations.  
 Key words:   Pollutants •  Sintering •  Flue gas •  Control technologies 
4.1  Overview 
 The sintering process is an important part of  iron and steel production . During sin-
tering, iron ore, pulverized coal (anthracite) and lime, blast furnace dust, mill scale, 
and steel slag are blended in a certain proportion and heated. Heat from fuel com-
bustion melts part of the sintering materials and the bulk can bind into lumps. As a 
result, sintering materials are transformed into sinter with enough strength and  grain 
size  to be used as clinker for iron making. Sintering of iron ore ﬁ nes is a compre-
hensive and complex process involving a variety of physical and chemical changes. 
Within a few minutes or less, due to the strong heat exchange, the temperature of the 
sintering material increases from less than 70 °C to 1300–1500 °C. Thus, large 
amounts of ﬂ ue gas are produced. About 4000–6000 m 3 per ton ﬂ ue gas sinter are 
produced during the sintering process. The  temperature of the sintering ﬂ ue gas 
ﬂ uctuates between 100 and 200 °C, the dust load is 1–5 g/m 3 , and the water content 
of ﬂ ue gas is approximately 10 % Vol. In the process of sintering, large amounts of

SOx, NOx, HF, dioxins, and other gaseous pollutantsare produced, showing that 
steel sintering process is facing huge environmental pressure. 
 Generally speaking, sintering ﬂ ue gas pollutants control technologies include con-
trol of source, process, and end treatment, and end treatment is the most common 
used method at present. The developed countries have removed from single control 
of dust and SO 2 to a comprehensive control of mutiple pollutants. It can be shown 
from related  technology development   the trends that synergetic and joint control the 
sintering ﬂ ue gas pollutants is the direction for the future (Dickson et al.  1989 ). China 
began to focus on the control of sintering ﬂ ue gas from 2000, and by the end of 2012, 
389 sets of iron and steeling sintering desulfurization facilities had been constructed, 
and the total area of puriﬁ ed sintering machine reached 63,200 m 2 . More than a dozen 
types of  desulfurization technology for iron and steel sintering ﬂ ue gas have been 
used, and about 80 % of the sintering machines use an Electrostatic precipitator . The 
dust emission concentration can normally be controlled under 50 mg/m 3 . However, 
with increasing requirement from the government for environmental protection, the 
emission standard for iron and steel sintering ﬂ ue gas has become stricter than before. 
In 2011, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection issued the Pollution Control 
Technology Policy for the  iron and steel industry , in which a comprehensive preven-
tion and control technology was put forward. According to this policy, the key point 
the iron and steel industry should be low- carbon and energy-saving. The industry 
should focus on clean production and be supported by effective pollution prevention 
and control technology with the purpose of synergetic control of atmospheric pollu-
tion by adopting  end-treatment technology for emission reduction. 
 The existing emission standard for iron and steeling sintering ﬂ ue gas in China 
was published in 2012. The mission standard for pollutants such as SO 2 in this new 
standard became stricter. In this standard, the  Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region , 
Yangtze River Delta, and the Zhujiang River Delta are designated as speciﬁ c emis-
sion limited areas; in such areas, the requested emission value of pollutants are as 
follows: particles, less than 40 mg/m 3 ; SO 2 , less than 180 mg/m 3 ; NOx, less than 
300 mg/m 3 ; ﬂ uoride, less than 4.0 mg/m 3 ; and dioxin, less than 0.5 ng-TEQ/m 3 . 
Therefore, it is important to select appropriate control technology for ﬂ ue gas pol-
lution. Based on a  systematic description of relevant puriﬁ cation technologies, this 
chapter reviews the current situation for sintering ﬂ ue gas control in China and the 
technology development trend. Application cases are described, with the purpose of 
providing an important reference for the choice of control technology for sintering 
ﬂ ue gas emission for domestic and international steel corporations. 
4.2  De-dust technologies for Sintering Flue Gas Control 
 The sintering process is the largest source of ﬂ ue gas dust emission in the iron and 
steel industry. These emissions occupy 41 % of the whole iron and steel industry. 
Therefore, the key to  emission reduction in the iron and steel industry is in the sin-
tering (pelleting) process. There are various types of dust collector for sintering ﬂ ue 
gas: mechanical dust collectors, electric dust collectors, bag de-dusting collectors, 
T. Zhu et al.

61
electric-bag composite dust collectors, new wet electric dust collectors, inorganic 
membrane dust collectors, etc. The relationship between the efﬁ ciency of de- dusting 
technology and the particle size of each technology is shown in Fig.  4.1 .
4.2.1  Mechanical Dust Extractors 
 Mechanical dust extractors are mainly gravity sedimentation types or cyclone sepa-
rating de-dusting systems. The mechanical extractors are usually characterised with 
simple structure, stable de-dusting efﬁ ciency, and being maintenance-free. However, 
their de-dusting efﬁ ciency is approximately 80 %, which makes it difﬁ cult to meet 
the standard of 30 mg/m 3 , and even more difﬁ cult to meet the PM 2.5 aerodynamic 
diameter less than 2.5 μm) emission  standard in the future. 
4.2.2  Electrostatic Precipitators 
 About 80 % of sintering machines in China are equipped with electrostatic precipi-
tators due to the large amount of ﬂ ue gas with high temperature and humidity. The 
exit dust concentration of ﬂ ue dust emission is 50–150 mg/m 3 , which is much higher

than that in developed countries (20 mg/m 3 ). Some factors such as regional differ-
ences, technical quality, and economic, there is a certain gap in the level of environ-
mental management between large enterprises and middle/small-sized enterprises as 
the electrostatic precipitators of a 214 m 2 sintering machine of the Anshansteel 
Group Corporation and the measured emission concentration at outlet is 45 mg/m 3 . 
Electrostatic precipitators of a 400 m 2 sintering machine in the Anyang Iron & Steel 
Group Co., Ltd Sinter Plant adopts two sets of 300 m 2 double-rooms and four elec-
tric-ﬁ eld dust collectors were adopted; the measured dust emission concentration is 
≤50 mg/m 3 . 
4.2.3  Bag Filters  
 Bag ﬁ lters separate dust particle from the smoke ﬂ ow by using a ﬁ lter-bag made 
from porous ﬁ lter cloth. Figure  4.2 shows the structure of a bag de-dusting collector. 
Flue gas ﬂ ows from outside to the inside of the ﬁ lter bag and the dust particles are 
blocked on the outside of the ﬁ lter bag. Bag ﬁ lters are characterized with high efﬁ -
ciency, high degree of automation (can be maintained on-line), long service life of 
the key component (the dust bag lasts 1.5 years), and high operation cost. Factors 
affecting the efﬁ ciency of bag ﬁ lters are dust size, concentration power, bulk density 
of dust, dust cohesiveness, ﬂ ue gas temperature, humidity, oxygen content, and pH 
value. In Shanxi Hanzhong iron and steel  group , bag de-dusting collectors were 
adopted after the sintering machine expansion; the local environmental protection 
department reported a dust emission concentration is 20 mg/m 3 .

4.2.4  Electric–Bag Composite Dust Collectors 
 Electric–bag composite dust collectors combine the advantages of electrostatic de- 
dusting and bag de-dusting. It is a highly efﬁ cient dust collector that removes large 
dust particles by electrostatic de-dusting before the ﬁ lter bag. It makes full use of 
the advantages of electric dust collectors, bag dust collectors and exhibits new per-
formance by the combination. The system can make up the shortcomings of the 
electrostatic precipitator and bag ﬁ lter. The composite dust collector has many de- 
dusting advantages such as high efﬁ ciency, stable operation, low running resistance 
of the ﬁ lter bag, long service life, and small cover area. Therefore, it is one of the 
main technologies used for the control of tiny particles of dust, PM 2.5 , and other  pol-
lutants such as heavy metal mercury. Some electric–bag composite dust collectors 
have been successfully applied to sintering plants in China.  
4.2.5  Wet-Type Electric Dust Collectors 
 Wet-type electric de-dusting technology has been developed on the basement of 
dry-type electric de-dusting. Before entering the wet-type electric de-duster, the ﬂ ue 
gas should be wetted and saturated in a spray tower or the diffusing section of the 
entrance. Then, after the saturated ﬂ ue gas enters the electric ﬁ eld, dust particles and 
droplets in the gas become charged and migrate down to the dust-collecting elec-
trode under the inﬂ uence of the electric ﬁ eld. Droplets attached to the plate connect 
with each other to form a liquid membrane that falls into the mud groove at the bot-
tom of the dust collector, together with dust particles under the action of gravity. 
There is no need for shaking and hitting devices. This system can help to eliminate 
the secondary bolowing dust, so the efﬁ ciency of de-dusting will be improved. A 
wet-type electric dust collector has been successfully used by the Baoshan Iron & 
Steel Co., Ltd. of China and Qianan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. After treatment, the ﬂ ue 
gas emissions can meet the requirements of relevant environmental protection 
guidelines. This system will be gradually applied to the de-dusting of  sintering ﬂ ue 
dust in the future. 
 In addition to the above forms of dust collector, electric coagulation technology 
can help to remove ﬁ ne particles and has good developmental prospects. The tech-
nology of rotation electrodes can effectively avoid shaking the dust, with a signiﬁ -
cant reduction in dust emission concentration. The  high-frequency pulse-current 
transformer (HFPT) technology can be used in high-frequency pulse-current dust 
collectors and thus improve the efﬁ ciency of electric de-dusting. Furthermore, other 
dust collectors such as inorganic ceramic membranes and metal gauzes have the 
advantages of resistance to high temperature and corrosion with high mechanical 
strength and long service life; these kinds of dust collectors can also be used for de-
dusting of iron and steel sintering ﬂ ue gas.

4.3  SO 2 Control Technologies in Sintering Flue Gas 
 As the only large-scale commercial applicated desulfurization method in the world, 
FGD (ﬂ ue gas desulfurization) now includes more than 200 kinds of desulfurization 
technology. On the basis of adding water or not, also the dry or wet forms of desul-
furization by-product, sintering ﬂ ue gas desulfurization can be divided into three 
categories: wet process, semidry process, and dry process, as show in Fig.  4.3 .
 Early treatment of sintering ﬂ ue gas in European and North American countries 
mainly concentrated on dust and dioxin (PCDD/Fs). There were only a few devices 
for desulfurization of sintering ﬂ ue gas, because the sulfur content in the raw mate-
rials originally used (iron ore and coke fuel) was low and the emission concentration 
of SO 2 can meet the emission standards. At present, the main sintering ﬂ ue gas 
desulfurization technologies used in European and North American are (1) spray 
dryer absorption (SDA) semi-dry desulfurization, as used in the Duisburg Iron and 
Steel plant sintering machine in Germany; (2) novel integrated desulfurization 
(NID) dry desulfurization, as used by Alstom in France; (3) MEROS dry desulfur-
ization, researched by Voestalpine in German and implemented in the Linz steel 
plant; and (4) circulating ﬂ uidized bed (CFB) semi-dry desulfurization, as used in 
the Dillinger Hütte sintering machine in Germany. 
 At present, the sintering ﬂ ue gas desulfurization technologies being used in iron 
and steel enterprises in China mainly include (1) the limestone-gypsum sulfate 
method, as applied in the Baosteel (Group) company, Meishan (Shanghai) Iron & 
Steel Corp., Ltd., and Xiangshan Iron & Steel Group Co., Ltd.; (2) ammonia–
ammonia sulfate method, as applied in the Liuzhou Iron and Steel (Group) Company, 
Xingtai Iron & Steel Corp., Ltd., Nanjing Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd., Shandong 
Rizhao Steel Holding Group Co., Ltd., and Kunming Iron & Steel Holding Co., 
Ltd.; (3) CFB, as applied in the Fujian Sangang Group Co., Ltd., Meishan (Shanghai) 
Iron & Steel Corp., Ltd., and Han-Steel Group Co., Ltd.; (4) spray drying adsorp-
tion method, as applied in the Jiangsu Shagang Group Co., Ltd., Shan Steel Group 
Co., Ltd., Anshansteel Group Corporation, and Shandong Taishan Steel Group Co., 
Ltd.; (5) NID method, as applied in the Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Corp.; (6)

organic amines method, as applied in the Laigang Group Co., Ltd.; (7) ionic liquid 
method, as applied in the Pansteel Group Co., Ltd.; and (8) dual-alkali method, as 
applied in the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Group.There are many desulfurization 
technologies have been used in China, but the iron and steel enterprises that have 
installed sintering ﬂ ue gas desulfurization equipment shows different running 
effects. This is mainly because of the lackness of suitable and mature technology for 
sintering ﬂ ue gas desulfurization in China. For iron and steel enterprises, investment 
in sintering ﬂ ue gas desulfurization  technology and evaluating the inﬂ uence of 
desulfurization on the manufacture are extremly important. 
4.3.1   Limestone–Gypsum Wet Method of Desulfurization 
 In November 2005, the Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. of China set sintering ﬂ ue gas 
desulfurization technology as their key research project and the Baoshan Research 
Institute took the lead in carrying out such research in China. This generated the 
technique and equipment technology of XPB (jet cyclone) sintering ﬂ ue gas desul-
furization. Three sets of large-scale sintering machines for full ﬂ ue gas desulfuriza-
tion projects were established in 2008. The No. 2 sintering machine desulfurization 
project was put into operation by a branch of Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. in 2010. 
The basic information for four sets of projects is shown in Table  4.1 .
4.3.2  Ammonia–Ammonia Sulfate Desulfurization  
 Many enterprises in China have selected the ammonia method for desulfurization of 
sintering ﬂ ue gases like the 2 × 230 m 2 sintering machine in Weifang Iron & Steel 
Co., Ltd., 2 × 180 m 2 sintering machine of Shandong Rizhao Steel Holding Group 
Co., Ltd., 150 m 2 sintering machines of Hangzhou Iron & Steel Group Company 
and Xingtai Iron & Steel Corp., Ltd., 130 m 2 sintering machine of Kunming Iron & 
Steel Holding Co., Ltd., 360 m 2 sintering machine of Nanjing Iron & Steel Group 
Corp., and the 2 × 83 m 2 , 265 m 2 , and 110 m 2 sintering machines of Liuzhou Iron 
and Steel (Group) Company.

 The 2 × 83 m 2 sintering machine–desulfurization project of the Liuzhou Iron and 
Steel (Group)  Company began construction in July 2006 and was completed in 
February 2007. The total investment was about 60 million Yuan. The operational-
parameters of the system are shown in Table  4.2 .
4.4  Control Technologies for Nitrogen Oxide 
in Sintering Flue Gas 
 NO x control technologies include process control and end-of-pipe technologies. 
(Table  4.3 ).
4.4.1  Flue Gas Circulation 
 The denitriﬁ cation technique ﬂ owchart for sintering ﬂ ue gas circulation is shown in 
Fig.  4.4 . The system mainly consists of a changeover valve for circulating ﬂ ue gas, 
an high efﬁ cient cyclone dust collector, ﬂ ue gas mixing chamber, and circulating 
pipe. The ﬂ ue gas from sintering process enters a mixing chamber through an 
induced draft fan to mix with partial cold ring waste gas after removing dust ﬂ ue. 
Then, it enters a sealed air bells cap, which is ﬁ lled with oxygen-enriched air to 
guarantee that the quality of sinter is not inﬂ uenced.
 To date, typical circulation  techniques for waste gas include regional waste gas 
circulation technology developed by Nippon Steel of Japan, EOS (emission opti-
mized sintering), LEEP (low emission and energy optimized sinter  production ) as 
well as Eposint (environmental process optimized sintering) developed by 
Voestalpine Proﬁ lform Co., Ltd. 
4.4.2  Selective Catalytic Reduction Method 
 The denitration technology of  selective catalytic reduction (SCR) refers to changing 
NOx to N 2 via reduction using a catalyst at a certain temperature. The technique has 
become one of the most widely applied for industrial ﬂ ue gas denitriﬁ cation

technology, and its removal efﬁ ciency for the ﬂ ue gas from coal-ﬁ red boilers is 
more than 90 %. SCR is the best denitration technology widely applied at present. 
The reaction mechanism of SCR is very complex and it mainly injects NH 3 to 
change NOx in ﬂ ue gas into N 2 and H 2 O under the presence of catalyst with reaction 
temperature at 250–450°C.

 The catalyst is the key of the SCR technology. According to the different active 
components, it can be divided into metal oxide catalysts, molecular sieve catalyst 
and noble metal catalysts. Currently, the metal oxide catalysts is the most widely 
applied.. The catalysts as SCR denitration engineering application are three main 
types, including honeycomb catalyst, ﬂ at plate catalyst and corrugated plate cata-
lyst. In terms of market share of SCR catalysts at present, the honeycomb catalyst 
plays a dominant role with 70 %, the ﬂ at plate catalyst accounts for approximately 
25 %, and the corrugated plate catalyst accounts for approximately 5 %. 
4.4.3  Oxidation Absorption Method 
 If NO is oxidized to NO 2 , N 2 O 3 , or N 2 O 5 , it can be removed via absorption and 
desorption usingwater or alkaline substances in the desulfurization system. The oxi-
dation absorption denitration technique mainly combines the gas-phase oxidation of 
ozone with an existing desulfurizing absorption tower to realize combined desulfur-
ization and  denitriﬁ cation . The technological  process is shown in Fig.  4.5 .
4.5  Dioxin Control Technology for Sintering Flue Gases 
4.5.1  Emission Characteristics of Dioxin in the Sintering 
Process 
 Because of different conditions in different the countries, the proportion of dioxin 
emission in the steel industry is different from that of total dioxin emissions. For 
example, the dioxin emissions mainly is from smelting in Germany and Australia,

but major from wood combustion in Austria, whereas about 45.6 % from production 
of steel and other metals in China. Research has shown that the emissions of dioxin 
by the  Chinese steel industry are mainly concentrated in the sintering process. Its 
emissions account for more than 90 % of the total emissions of the steel industry. 
 Figure  4.6 shows the emission characteristics for 17 kinds of toxic  PCDD/Fs 
from different sintering plants and a laboratory simulation of the sintering process. 
The maximum emission concentration is OCDD in the PCDD group; at the same 
time, 2,3,7,8-TCDF and 1,2,3,4,5,7-HpCDF are major emissions in  polychlorinated 
dibenzofurans (PCDF) emissions. Analysis of dioxin species on the particles 
between in front of the Electrostatic precipitator and after the Electrostatic precipi-
tator showed that dioxin on the particles does not exhibit a speciﬁ c peak (McKay G 
2002; Evans CS et al  2005 ; Guerriero E et al  2009 ).
4.5.2  Control of Dioxin in the Sintering Process 
4.5.2.1  Source Reduction 
 According to the causes of dioxin formation, the presence of chlorine is an impor-
tant factor in the process of dioxin formation; therefore, it is better to use material 
with low chlorine content. Because of the relatively high chlorine content in dust 
and in steel rolling, the content of chlorine in the mixed raw materials can be 
changed by changing the proportion of dust removal and steel rolling. The presence 
of copper in raw materials has a extremely catalytic effect on the formation of 
dioxin. Speciﬁ c types of iron ore are likely to be the main source of copper, so 
choosing the right iron ore is very important. The return materials including dust, 
iron oxide scale, sludge and others which are served as raw materials in sintering 
could be treated via washing or high-temperature to reduce the chlorine and copper 
elements. In the end, sintering materials containing small amounts of dioxin precur-
sor substances should be selected; for example, biomass fuels should be avoided 
(Dickson L C et al 1989). 
4.5.2.2  Process Control 
 Studies have indicated that the addition of inhibitors can effectively block the for-
mation of dioxin, and make it an effective method for controlling dioxin emissions. 
There are two categories of inhibitors, one is alkaline earth metal and the other 
is sulfur and nitrogen in inhibitor. So, there are two mechanisms for inhibitors. 
Alkaline earth metals can effectively reduce the content of HCl in ﬂ ue gas, whereas 
sulfur and nitrogen inhibitors can make the catalyst which can generate dioxin "dis-
abled". In addition, because of the high temperature of the sintering process (1200–
1300 °C), the ﬂ ue gas can be recycled so that the dioxin-rich gas passes through the 
high temperature zone again, enabling high temperature decomposition of formed 
dioxin.

4.5.2.3  Terminal Management 
 Generally speaking, the use of source reduction or process control cannot meet the 
strict dioxin emission standards for sintering ﬂ ue gas. For the dioxin in the terminal 
of the ﬂ ue gas emissions, special measures must be adopted. With the increasingly 
stringent environmental protection laws and regulations, processing for particulate 
matters and SO 2 have become very common in ﬂ ue gas management. These termi-
nal management methods remove a certain amount of dioxin together with the par-
ticles. However, dioxin in the gas phase must be further treated, and the original ﬂ ue 
gas management equipment cannot be relied upon. The most efﬁ cient methods for 
controlling dioxin emissions are catalytic oxidation and activated carbon (jet or 
ﬁ xed bed) adsorption. Generally speaking, the cost of terminal management is much 
higher than that of process control. For countries or regions with more stringent 
emissions standards, management measures are usually selected according to the 
characteristics of ﬂ ue gas emissions and the emission standards. 
 At present,  terminal management for industrial operation mainly includes wet 
cleaning methods (such as Airﬁ ne and Wetﬁ ne systems), electrostatic dust or bag 
dust, SCR, and activated carbon adsorption (Ide Y et al  1996 ; Bertinchamps F et al 
 2006 ). Only the SCR process can provide directly decomposition of dioxin. Gas 
scrubber and ﬁ ltering devices mainly realize the transfer of dioxin pollutants and 
need to manage further. Although these methods have proven effectively in reduc-
ing dioxin pollution, the operating expenses are higher. 
4.6  Multiple  Pollutants Control Technologies 
for Sintering Fuel Gas 
 Beside SO 2 produced in the ﬂ ue from the sintering process, NO x , CO x , HF, PCDDs, 
PCDFs and other kinds of harmful gaseous pollutants are also produced. China has 
been implementing a single control strategy of pollutants, focused on period key 
pollution control as the main characteristics, established air pollution management 
system with the combination of total amount and concentration control and devel-
oped a series of more mature dust and sulfur separate removal technologies. 
However, China has generally used a hierarchical governance mode for single pol-
lutants, with the increasing the types of pollution control, the number of sintering 
gas treatment equipments are more and more in the iron and steel industry. This has 
not only increased the cost of equipment and  running , but also made the whole pol-
lution control system much larger and more complex. Outstanding problems include 
the large amount of space needed for equipment, high energy consumption, and the 
greater risk of causing secondary pollution have emerged. The developmentof efﬁ -
cient and economic pollution control technology is a hot point from the point of 
international technologies (Knoblauch K et al.  1989 ). 
4 Pollutants Emission and Control for Sintering Flue Gas

72
 With the aim of cooperative control of sintering ﬂ ue gas pollution, the existing 
industrialized applications, which are mainly focused on separate pollutant control, 
have been developed to absorb many kinds of pollutions simultaneously, for exam-
ple, by adding an annexing agent to a common gas desulfurization system. The 
importance of this for dry (active carbon) and semidry (humidifying) methods of 
ﬂ ue gas decontamination are discussed in the rest of this section. 
4.6.1  Actived Carbon Multiple Pollutants Control Technology  
 The Taiyuan iron and steel plant in China has adopted the dry active carbon method 
for desulfurization and denitriﬁ cation. The multiple pollutants removal project was 
completed in 2006 with 450 m 2 sintering machine and the ﬂ ue gas volume of 
1.4×10 6 m 3 /h. The annual sintering smoke SO 2 emissions are 6821 tons and for NOx 
2744 tons; this is the ﬁ rst case in the Chinese sintering industry. 
 The system runs steadily after putting into use, with operability of over 90 %. 
The Taiyuan environmental monitoring central station measured the emissions in 
sintering smoke as SO 2 7.5 mg/m 3 , NOx 101 mg/m 3 , and dust 17.1 mg/m 3 . 
Desulphurization efﬁ ciency was over 95 % and denitriﬁ cation efﬁ ciency was over 
40 %. Both of them reached design criterion and pollutant discharge standards. The 
annual secondary product (oil of vitriol) output was 9000 tons, and all of them were 
used in the steel rolling acid pickling process and the sulfur and ammonia produc-
tion during coking, with turning waste into wealth and realizing an industrial chain 
of circular economy (Table  4.4 ).
4.6.2  Desulfurization with Actived Carbon Injection  
4.6.2.1  MEROS Technology 
 Siemens industrial systems and the technology services of Voestalpine AG devel-
oped the maximized emission reduction of sintering technology (MEROS), which 
can produce a large reduction in sintering emissions. The technology as a continual 
treatment is able to reduce the dust, the harmful metal and organic matter to a lower 
emission level in the sintering fuel gas.  
 The MEROS method uniformly jets the adsorption and desulfurization 
additive(s) into the sintering smoke under backwash and high speed conditions, and 
uses efﬁ cient double-ﬂ ow nozzle to cool wetting the sintering ﬂ ue gas from the 
reactor. After leaving the modiﬁ ed reactor, the ﬂ ue gas with dust passes through a 
pulse bag ﬁ lter to remove dust particles. To enhance gas puriﬁ cation efﬁ ciency and 
reduce the cost of annexing agent, the separated dust in the pulse bag ﬁ lter is recy-
cled to the air ﬂ ow after the adjusted reactor, and part of the dust leaves the system 
to go to a storage silo. The MEROS can simultaneously remove desulfurization,

HCl, HF, dioxin and other pollutants. And it aslo removes all the condensable vola-
tile organic compounds (VOCs).  
4.6.2.2  IOCFB Multiple Pollutants Control Technology 
 Inner and outer circulating ﬂ uidized bed (IOCFB) multiple pollutants control tech-
nology was developed by the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of 
Sciences. IOCFB multiple pollutants control technology uses Ca(OH) 2 and other 
alkaline absorbents to absorb SO 2 and other acid gases in ﬂ ue gas, and simultane-
ously uses activated carbon or activated coke adsorbent to adsorb the dioxin-like 
pollutants in ﬂ ue gas. The method is based on the theory of a circulating ﬂ uidized 
bed, through multiple recirculation of absorbent and adsorbent, prolonging the con-
tacttime of absorbent and adsorbent with ﬂ ue gas, and improving the utilization rate 
of the absorbent and adsorbent. The desulfurization efﬁ ciency is stable at 90 % in 
the case of a low calcium to sulfur ratio (Ca/S < 1.3). 
 The 132 m 2 sintering machine of the Xuzhou Chengri Iron and Steel Co., Ltd 
produces a ﬂ ue gas volume of 900,000 m 3 /h. The IOCFB  multiple pollutants coor-
dinated control technology has been used as a pilot application demonstration in the 
plant and completely built in 2013. The system design parameters are shown in 
Table  4.5 .
 In March 2014, the project successfully passed the acceptance of the environ-
mental protection department. Project monitoring showed that the concentration of 
SO 2  was 570 mg/m 3 before desulfurization and 20 mg/m 3 after desulfurization; 
The desulfurization efﬁ ciency reached 95 %. The dioxin concentration was 107.9 pg 
TEQ/m 3 before desorption and 22.2 pg TEQ/m 3  after desorption; The desorption 
efﬁ ciency was 79 %. The heavy metal Hg concentration was 20.3 μg/m 3 before 
desorption and 0.205 μg/m 3 after desorption; The desorption efﬁ ency was 99 %.

Sinter Plant Operations: Hazardous Emissions
Jin-Luh Mou and R. John Morrison
Abstract  This article presents an outline of the iron ore sintering process, which 
introduces the blast furnace slag-forming requirements to allow an understanding of 
the required adjustments to flux addition in the sintering process; some basic concepts 
of the sintering reactions are also introduced. The recovery of miscellaneous wastes 
using high S, N, Cl content materials in sinter plants has been associated with some 
hazardous emissions, such as dust, NOx, SOx, and dioxins. The formation mechanism 
of these hazardous pollutants and some practical countermeasures are discussed.
5.1  Introduction
Before introducing the iron ore sintering process, some essential background infor-
mation should be understood. This includes the following questions: why should 
iron ore fines be converted into lumpy materials? Why are fluxes added to the pro-
cess? What are the chemical, physical, and metallurgical requirements of sinter ore?
The blast furnace operation is a bit like a black box; the gases and material flows 
interact counter-currently, and it is not possible to tell whether the iron burden is soften-
ing, melting, and dripping optimally inside the furnace. Only by checking the slag com-
position is it possible to tell whether the blast furnace is functioning satisfactorily or not.
A trigonal phase diagram of CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 (Fig. 5.1) is an important guideline 
for blast furnace operations; accordingly, it is used to adjust the slag component 
ratio to reach near the eutectic point. This leads to the formation of the blast furnace 
slag with the lowest melting point, the best fluidity, and the best sulfur removal 
efficiency. Another important slag-forming component is MgO, which will facilitate 
the breaking of the slag silicate texture from framework, chain or double chain sili-
cates into orthosilicates, or short-range silicates that enhances the fluidity.

For the four major slag components, certain ratio ranges are required: B2 = CaO/
SiO2 = 1.15–1.25, B3 = (CaO + MgO)/SiO2 = 1.40–1.45, and B4 = (CaO + MgO)/
(SiO2 + Al2O3) = 1.00–1.10.
5.1.1  Size Requirements
A blast furnace is a “picky eater”; only the lumpy materials are fed into its belly. The 
size requirements of the iron burden for a blast furnace are iron ore lump, 6.3–31.5 mm; 
pellet, 9–18 mm; sinter, 5–50 mm; and coke, 25–80 mm. Iron ore fines, with the par-
ticle size of <10 mm, are not suitable as blast furnace feed. Several agglomeration 
processes have therefore been developed; if the ore type contains predominantly very 
fine particles (<0.075 mm), then a hot bond pelletizing process is applied. If the ore 
type has iron ore fines with coarser particles, then a sintering process is used.
5.1.2  Metallurgical Property Requirements
When the materials descend inside the furnace and the temperature reaches around 
550 °C, Fe2O3 is reduced to Fe3O4 with around a 4 % volume expansion; some of the 
particles break down into small fragments and get blown out of the furnace with the

blast current. The breakage material is mainly composed of secondary hematite (the 
hematite that recrystallizes from the melt), therefore, to control the combustion 
atmosphere (to control the FeO level in sinter), and the chemical composition of 
sintering materials has become the key issue to minimize the reduction degradation.
When the temperature reaches 900–950  °C, magnetite (Fe3O4) is reduced to 
wustite (FeO); if the sinter has a compact texture without pores, then the reduction 
speed is low, and this reduces the burden descent speed, which leads to low BF 
productivity. The reducibility index is controlled mainly by the pore texture and is 
an important index for sinter ore.
When the temperature reaches 1400–1650 °C, the iron burden turns into liquid 
FeO or liquid Fe0; softening and dripping occur in the cohesive zone. If the dripping 
melt has a high viscosity, then a coarser cohesive zone will be generated and will 
reduce the gas permeability, eventually resulting in low utilization of the reducing 
gas, and decrease the productivity. The softening and melting properties are con-
trolled by slag components and the ratio among sinter, lump, and pellet; a good 
control of the burden ratio and slag-forming components is another important oper-
ational parameter.
5.2  Brief Background on Iron Ore Sintering
Modern sinter plants were developed in 1906 by Arthur S. Dwight and Richard 
L. Lloyd, and a chain grate strand type sinter machine which was able to operate 
continuously had been put into operation at Birdboro, Pennsylvania, USA, in 1911 
(Vegman et al. 2004). The sintering process gained popularity quickly around the 
1950s as positive links were found between blast furnace performance and ferrous 
burden of the sinter ratio.
5.2.1  Outline of Sintering Operations
Iron ore sintering is an agglomeration process, which combines fine mineral particles 
into a porous mass by partial liquefaction caused by heat generated from coke breeze 
combustion; a flow diagram of the iron ore sintering process is shown in Fig. 5.2.
The chemistry of the raw materials is calculated to fit BF slag formation requirements; 
under this operational guideline, iron ores together with fluxes (limestone, dolomite, ser-
pentine) and reverts (mill scale, flue dust BOF OG sludge, etc.) are blended in the blend-
ing yard and conveyed to the sinter plant proportioning silos, where the coke breeze, 
sinter plant return fines (SP/RF), and tuning fluxes are added and granulated through 
mixing drums to form a sinter mixture that is laid onto the sinter strand. Eventually, the 
coke breeze is ignited by an ignition furnace to provide the energy for sintering.
The CaO and MgO slag components do not coexist with iron ores and are added 
separately; therefore, CaO (such as limestone) and MgO (such as serpentine or 
dolomite) are mixed with iron ore fines as the sinter raw mix for the sintering

process. The ultrafine iron ore reacts with the fluxes and forms a bonding matrix 
(silico-­ferrite of calcium and alumina, SFCA) at a reaction temperature of 
1300 ± 50 °C from the combustion of coke breeze.
In order to promote the sinter plant productivity, a particle segregation device is 
installed to improve the sinter bed permeability. The main concept is to lay the 
coarse particles in the bottom layer and fine particles in the upper layer. There are 
several segregation devices, such as deflective plate, SSW (segregation slit wire, 
developed by Steel Plantech Corp.), ISF (intensified sifting feeder, developed by 
NSC), and MBF (magnetic braking feeder, developed by JFE).
Figure 5.3 shows a cross-sectional profile of sinter belt. The coke breeze is first 
ignited in the front end of the sinter strand; gas flow is sucked from upper surface 
and passes through the sinter bed to the bottom wind boxes. The combustion zone 
reaches the sinter bed bottom where sinter strand also reaches the tail end.
The inter-belt is thus classified into several regions; from the bottom part of the 
front end is a wet zone, where the moisture accumulates. A dry zone is found on top 
of the wet zone, as the moisture is driven down by the heat. On top of the dry zone 
are the coke breeze ignition and combustion zones, where the partial liquefaction 
occurs for sintering reaction. Cold gas is sucked in from the top surface and cools 
down the sinter cake in a cooling zone. After cooling, the sinter cake becomes brittle 
due to volume shrinkage. The wind box temperature is gradually increased from the 
front end to the tail and reaches the highest point, where the combustion zone 
reaches the bottom, and is called the burnt through point. The gas flow rate profile 
is similar to the temperature profile; the flow rate is higher in the tail end.

5.2.2  Fundamental Reactions of the Sintering Process 
(Pimenta 2012)
In addition to the previous description of different temperature zones, a reduction 
region (rich in CO) is under the combustion zone, and an oxidation region, rich in 
O2, is above the combustion zone. Below the material melting point, some reactions 
happen between solid-solid states, such as evaporation, dehydration, carbonate 
decomposition, reduction, or reoxidation.
The whole sintering process based on the heating stages can be split into five 
steps as shown in Fig. 5.4 (Pimenta 2012).
Step 1. Hematite (Fe2O3) reacts with CaO to generate the first calcium ferrites at 
around 1100 °C (solid–solid reaction). Around 1200 °C, these calcium ferrites start 
to convert into the liquid phase. The liquid is rich in CaO and Fe2O3 and begins to 
combine with ultrafine iron oxides, SiO2, Al2O3, and MgO.
Step 2. Liquid phase starts to generate while temperature keeps on rising, and the 
superficial disintegration of hematite starts.
Step 3. The liquid melt assimilates with CaO and Al2O3, and the evolution of the 
reaction between liquid and hematite forms acicular calcium ferrites in the solid 
state (needle form), which are rich in Al2O3 and SiO2.
Step 4. If the process temperature does not reach above 1300 °C or the residence 
time above 1300 °C is very short, the microstructure after cooling will be rich in 
acicular calcium ferrites in a bulk of crystalline silicates and granular hematite. That 
is the heterogeneous sinter.
Step 5. If the process temperature exceeds 1300 °C and the residence time above 
1300 °C is long, columnar calcium ferrites and coarser recrystallized particles pre-
cipitate from melt. During the cooling step, skeletal rhombohedral hematite

precipitates from the liquid phase, and calcium ferrites crystallize as long columnar 
form flakes. That is the homogeneous sinter.
5.2.3  Mineral Transformation During Iron Ore Sintering 
Process
To convert the fine particles into lumpy agglomerates, the bonding matrix plays a 
major role (Fig. 5.5). When the coke breeze is combusted in the sinter bed, iron ore 
adhering fines together with the fluxes react and form the liquid melt; the wetting 
effect through this melt joins the iron ore particles together. Eventually, when the 
temperature cools down, this melt hardens, and the particles are bonded into lumpy

81
agglomerate. Of course, dissolution, thermal decomposition, reduction, oxidation, 
recrystallization, etc., occur during the heating stage.
5.3  Hazardous Pollutant Emissions from Sinter Plants
Some of the hazardous elements, such as S and N, are brought into the process with 
the coke breeze or iron ores, and others, such as Pb, Zn, Na, K, S, Cl, and oil, may 
come from the revert materials. These unwelcome materials are brought into the 
system and are associated with the hazardous emissions. A sinter plant is the major 
pollutant source in an integrated steelworks; some estimated figures are summa-
rized below, based on the assumed conditions.
Assumptions for a sinter plant emission:
An integrated steelworks produce 7.0 million tonnes of crude steel per annum (two 
sets of 4350 m3 inner volume blast furnace), and the sinter ratio for the blast furnace 
is 80 %; then, two sets of 500 m2 sinter plants are required to produce 10.2 million 
tonnes of sinter as the blast furnace iron burden. The fuel rate is 50 kg of coke 
breeze for per tonne of sinter, where the S content is 0.55–0.60 % and N is 0.8–1.0 % 
in the coke breeze. 2500 Nm3 air is required to produce one tonne of sinter. Only a 
de-dusting electrostatic precipitator (EP) is installed, without installing the de-SOx, 
de-NOx, and de-DXNs devices. The estimated figures are as follows 
O2:	
              ~15 %
CO:	
8000–10,000 ppm
CO2	
5.0–6.0 %
Dust	
40–50 mg/Nm3
SOx	
130–150 ppm
NOx	
150–200 ppm
PCDD/PCDFs	
0.8–2.0 ng I-TEQ/Nm3
5.3.1  Dust
The off-gas dust concentration is about ~50 mg/Nm3 with an EP removal efficiency 
of around 95 %; mostly the dust is composed of alkali chlorides and sulfates, which 
have high electric resistance and are hard to polarize in the electric field to be 
removed by the EP. These alkali chlorides are within the submicron particle range 
and generate the plume opacity together with the acid gases condensing on the sur-
face as aerosols. A simple countermeasure is to install a multi-pulse type electric 
field generator and change the rapping frequency to clean the adhered particles off 
the electric plates and wires.
However, the most harmful PM2.5 is not monitored in the stack emissions. It has 
been assumed that PM2.5 forms 70 % of the PM10 measured in the waste gas 
(Wright 2014). This assumption is based on previous studies that have been 
undertaken by BlueScope Steel Limited that were considered as a reference index.
5  Sinter Plant Operations: Hazardous Emissions

82
5.3.2  NOx (Mou 1998)
Suzuki et al. (1975) conducted sinter pot tests by replacing air with 
O2(21 %) + Ar(79 %) and found no difference in the NOx emissions. This indicated 
that the NOx is fuel generated with almost no thermal NOx or prompt NOx in the 
sintering process.
An analysis of the chemical composition of the sinter raw materials showed 
that more than 90 % of the nitrogen comes from coke breeze (Mou 1992). It is 
difficult to identify what types of nitrogen compound exist in the coke breeze. 
However, it is believed that the nitrogen is tightly bound and for the most part in 
aromatic compounds. In the heating stage, the fuel-bound nitrogen compounds 
will, most likely, undergo some decomposition prior to entering the combustion 
zone; thus, it is not surprising that in the oxidation zone, the nitrogen compounds 
turn into the intermediates, such as HCN, CH, and amine radicals (Glassman 
1987). These fragments react with oxygen in the continuous heating stage and 
form the nitrogen oxides. These intermediate compounds also contain hydrogen 
and carbon, which have a strong affinity with oxygen. In other words, the hydro-
gen or carbon will compete with nitrogen for the oxygen. Therefore, the presence 
C, CO, H, or OH in the ­combustion system will have some depression effect on 
the formation of nitrogen oxides.
Sasaki et al. (1990a, b) reported that a fast coke combustion rate led to higher 
(CO + CO2)/O2 and CO/O2 ratio being found in the waste gases. Kasai et al. (1992) 
reported that faster coke combustion rate led to lower NO emissions. Obviously, the 
CO/O2 ratio in the combustion zone is the major factor controlling the final NO 
emission. The combustion speed affects the atmospheric condition in the sintering 
process. Therefore, the improvement of coke combustibility would be a feasible 
countermeasure to depress the NO emission.
Not all the nitrogen content in the sinter raw mix would convert into nitrogen 
oxides in the sintering process; the conversion ratio will depend on the combustion 
condition especially the CO/O2 ratio. Hida et al. (1980) and Kasai et al. (1992, 
1993a, b) developed the conversion ratio formula. An estimated conversion ratio 
based on a real sinter plant operation data is around 36 % (Mou 1998).
5.3.3  De-NOx
Currently, there are less than five sets of de-NOx facilities being installed in the 
world sinter plants; the technique being applied is the SCR process. WO3-TiO2-­
V2O5 catalysts are applied for de-NOx operation, where the liquid NH3 is injected 
into the reaction chamber under the operating temperature of 320–350 °C; the NOx 
removal efficiency can reach around 90 %. The reactions are summarized as 
follows.

An in-process de-NOx study (Mou 1998) concluded that NOx emissions in iron ore 
sintering process depend mainly on the coke breeze combustion condition. A faster 
combustion speed results in lower NOx emission. To enhance the granulation and 
improve the permeability of the sinter mix has been shown to be an effective counter-
measure by increasing the combustion speed and depressing the NOx emission.
This study also verified sugar is a strong binder in sinter mix granulation, improv-
ing sinter bed permeability and increasing the flame front speed; hence, the conver-
sion ratio of nitrogen fragments to nitrogen oxides is greatly reduced. Sinter pot test 
results showed 1 wt% of sugar addition to the sinter mix decreased the NO mass 
from 533.8 to 283.3 g/t. sinter, with nearly 47 % NO mass reduction. The NOx 
­concentration also decreased from 223 to 160 ppm with nearly 28 % concentration 
depression. Also, because of the shortened sintering time, sinter productivity is also 
significantly increased from 37.5 to 45.4 t/m2/24 h as the sinter strength is main-
tained at the same level. Sugar is a potential additive for in-system de-NOx in the 
iron ore sintering process.
5.3.4  SOx
The sulfur compounds in the sinter mix may be in organic or inorganic forms. In 
iron ores, especially igneous magnetite, some pyrite (FeS2) or chalcopyrite (FeCuS2) 
is always present and difficult to get rid of through magnetic separation or washing 
processes. In coke breeze, there are either organic or inorganic sulfur compounds. 
Although in the coal washing process some of the pyrite can be removed through 
flotation and density separation, the removal efficiency is limited by the size of 
pyrite. It is very difficult to separate organic compounds from the coal. In the coking 
process, some of the sulfur compounds go into the by-products or escape to the 
atmosphere, and some others still remain in the coke, which is the major source of 
sulfur oxides in sintering.
SO2 generated in the heating stage may be trapped by water (Martin 1984), lime-
stone (Anderson and Galwey 1995), or iron ores (Tu and Liu 1992); SO2 existing in 
water (referred to as S(IV)) occurs as three species, which are hydrated sulfur diox-
ide, bisulfite ion, and sulfite ion (Anderson and Galwey 1995).

The unionized acid (H2SO3) has never been observed; the fraction of S(IV) in 
each species is a function of pH value. At pH < 2, SO2(aq) is dominant; pH at 2–8, 
HSO3
− is formed; pH > 8, SO3
2− is the preferred form.
A SOx emission model in sintering process is summarized as follows (Mou 1998). 
The sulfur released in the combustion stage is most likely to be absorbed and trapped 
below the dry zone. No matter whether the sulfur is liquid (S8), sulfur dioxide (SO2), 
or both, the sulfur is stored in several forms beneath the dry zone in the sintering 
process. When the combustion zone passes through the lower part of the sinter bed 
without any absorbent materials beneath it, the sulfur compounds oxidize to sulfur 
dioxide again and finally escape out to the atmosphere (Fig. 5.6).
5.3.5  Sulfur Journey in Iron Ore Sintering Process
Mou (1998) indicated that around 50–55 % of the sulfur in the sinter mix is from the 
coke breeze in the form of pyrite and organic sulfur; the other 45–50 % is from iron 
ores, fluxes, and reverts, mainly in the form of pyrite, chalcopyrite, and calcium 
sulfates. After heating, sulfur reacts with iron ores and limestone to form calcium 
sulfates and pyrite, which remain in the sinter. An estimated sulfur journey is sum-
marized as follows (Mou 1998):

5.3.6  Conventional De-SOx Technologies
There are many applicable SOx removal technologies being applied in the combus-
tion process. Most are off-gas treatment processes (Table 5.1). The side effects are 
the difficulties of resourcing these de-SOx by-products, especially the generated 
dust and sludge from the iron ore sintering process, which contain many impurities, 
such as iron ore powder, KCl, and NaCl. This causes a second pollution problem.
5.3.7  In-Process De-SOx Technology
Mou (1998) discovered an in-process de-SOx countermeasure by adding urea 
directly into the sinter mix. Urea decomposes to NH3 at around 130 °C (Mcketta 
1982) in the sinter bed dry zone and is trapped in the wet zone as NH4OH and even-
tually released to the exhaust gas near the burnt through point (BTP), where the SOx 
(mainly SO2) is also released out at the BTP, due to the strong affinity characteristic 
between NH4SO4 and SO2. Eventually, (NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4, (NH4)2SO3, and 
NH4HSO3 are formed inside the exhaust gas system. The SOx is converted to 
ammonium sulfates/sulfites/bisulfates/bisulfite, and therefore the SOx concentra-
tion in the outlet gases drops significantly.
Pot tests and plant trials have proven the de-SOx efficiency to 95 % (Mou 2001). 
The drawback is that the sticky (NH4)2SO4 being brought out by the suction gas to 
the EP would adhere on the EP plate and wire and eventually lower the dust removal 
efficiency; the plume opacity becomes worse in a couple of days after the urea is 
added to the sintering process. Therefore, it is suggested to use wet EP or scrubber

when urea is added. Actually, NH3 is a basic reagent, besides its strong affinity to 
bind with SO2 but also to bind with HCl. In other words, urea addition is capable of 
removing both SO2 and HCl.
5.3.8  Dioxins-PCDD/PCDF (Kasai 2002)
Dioxins have been called the “century poison” with two congener groups being 
identified, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated diben-
zofurans (PCDF). In Japan, the coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (Co-PCB) that 
have a similar toxicity are also treated as a subgroup of dioxins. The chemical struc-
tures of dioxins and their toxicity are shown in Fig. 5.7, and molecular structures are 
shown in Fig. 5.8.
Up to now, no conclusive evidence has been presented for the formation mecha-
nism of PCDD/PCDFs. Two theories have been proposed, which are precursor con-
densation and de novo synthesis.

5.3.9  Formation Mechanism of Dioxins (Kasai 2002)
	1.	 Formation through precursors condensation
Molecules with six-member ring structures, such as chlorobenzenes and chlo-
rophenols, are heated in the combustion stage, where the chlorination, coupling 
reaction, and oxidation occur. Eventually, two six-member rings are joined 
together by two oxygen and the free radicals coupled with 1–8 Cl anions. The 
reaction temperature is above 800 °C, and the reaction is fast. The major conge-
ners through precursors condensation are PCDDs. A schematic illustration of the 
precursor condensation route is shown in Fig. 5.9.
	2.	 Formation through de novo synthesis
		
Dioxins forming through de novo synthesis mean direct formation of dioxins 
from carbonaceous materials at relatively low temperature. Reactions to form 
dioxins involve the splitting of macromolecular compounds containing six-
member rings. Normally, the reaction temperature is around 450 °C, and the 
major congeners are PCDF. An illustration of the de novo synthesis route is 
shown as Fig. 5.10.
Dioxin Formation in Sintering Process
Kasai (2002) established a dioxin formation model for the sintering process which 
explained the formation mechanism of dioxins in the sinter bed, as shown in 
Figs. 5.11 and 5.12.

Through the dioxin formation model, we can assume the dioxins would be 
released from the sinter bed when the combustion zone reaches the bottom; in other 
words, the dioxins are released out of the sinter bed around the BTP.
A survey result (Kasai 2002) indicated that the dioxin emission profile is similar 
to the temperature profile in each of the wind boxes. Additional surveys indicated 
that the major congeners of dioxins in the sintering process are PCDFs, the domi-
nate congener is 23478-P5CDF, and the dominate congener for TEQ is 23478-­
P5CDF (Figs. 5.13 and 5.14).

Kasama et al. (2006) conducted a detailed analysis of the exhaust gas at the 
NSSMC Oita No. 1 sintering plant. This clarified and specified the strand posi-
tions where dioxins were released into the exhaust gas. The results are summa-
rized as follows.
The release of dioxins was detected at two different positions. The first release 
position was located at the point where the drying zone reached the hearth layer, 
showing a broad peak containing a large amount of furans. The second release posi-
tion was located at the point where the melting zone reached the heath layer, show-
ing a sharp peak. Differences in dioxin congeners at the release positions imply a 
different mechanism of dioxin formation. The dioxins of the second release are 
considered to be formed in wind boxes at temperatures of 300 °C or more, with 
organic substances and chlorine supplied from incompletely sintered areas or with 
grease and dust in the wind boxes. This result has indicated that controlling the burn 
through point to the discharge end could be effective for decreasing the dioxin emis-
sions in the second location. Figure 5.15 shows a schematic image describing the 
release of exhaust gas components.
Figure 5.15 also summarizes the results of the exhaust gas measurements in a 
commercial sinter plant. It seems that the drying zone begins to reach the grate 
­surface near the sinter cake discharge side when the exhaust gas temperature reaches 
100 °C. Thereafter, the exhaust gas temperature keeps on rising slowly, and the wet 
zone almost disappears within the subsequent strand as indicated by reading the 
moisture change. The dust ascends together with the dioxin ascent in the latter part, 
probably due to the loss of the capability of capturing them in the sintering bed as a 
result of the disappearance of the wet zone.

From the results of the O2, CO2, and NOx measurements, the combustion of the 
fine coke seems to have been almost completed before it reached BTP. This may 
consequently indicate that, in the furthest area on the sinter cake discharge side after 
BTP, the coke combustion zone no longer exists and a high-temperature zone of 
over 1000 °C expands up to the hearth layer. Nevertheless, the wind box exhaust gas 
temperature rise is relatively slow because the sensible heat is consumed to increase 
the heat of the hearth layer and the grate.
From the next wind box, high-alkali and high-chlorine dust is affluently dis-
charged. KCl and NaCl, which are considered to be the main components of the 
discharged dust, have a high melting point of 770 and 801 °C, respectively, and a 
high boiling point of 1510 and 1413 °C. In order to volatilize them, a condition near 
the highest temperature in the sintering bed is required. Therefore, the highest part 
of the sintering temperature must have reached up to the grate surface. This result 
agrees with the discussions of Kawaguchi et al. (2002) on the volatilization of chlo-
rine. In BTP wind box, which comes after the chlorine release peak, a second-stage 
peak of dioxin release is observed. As regards the dioxins generated in the wind 
boxes close to the sinter cake discharge end, Tan and Neuschütz (2004) theoretically 
suggested the possibility of generation in the cooling process in the cooling zone, 
but no report has ever been made on this in commercial sintering equipment. The 
reason may be that, in production using sintering machines having a small number 
of wind boxes or in production where BTP is near the sinter cake discharge side, 
two phenomena occur in one wind box and these two could not be separately 
detected by the usual measurements.
The following two sources are conceivable for the supply of carbon and chlorine 
for the formation of dioxins in the second stage. One is the coke combustion zone 
that contains an un-sintered area where coke combustion remains incomplete until

92
it is discharged on account of sintering fluctuations. The incomplete combustion is 
often confirmed by the observation of sintered cakes on the discharge side. It is 
probable that small amounts of carbon and chlorine are supplied from this zone to 
cause dioxin formation such as the de novo synthesis reaction in the wind box. 
Although C and Cl are supplied in very small amounts, they are long exposed to a 
critical temperature zone, as long as several seconds, and may therefore be concen-
trated to a high level. The other source is grease and dust deposits on the inside 
surfaces of the wind boxes. Sealing grease is constantly fed to the slide surfaces of 
the sintering pallets. This grease loses its viscosity as it is heated in the latter half of 
the strand, is sucked into the wind box, and is deposited on its inside walls. Small 
amounts of chlorine contained in the grease and dust caught on the deposited grease 
are likely to cause dioxin generation slowly and progressively.
Kawaguchi et al. (2002) reported the memory effect of chlorine that remained in 
the wind box in their sinter pot test, seen in the form of re-volatilization and rediffu-
sion of the chlorine in the drying process. Effects of said deposits in commercial 
operations need to be further analyzed in detail. Dioxins released in front of the BTP 
are reducible in quantity by strengthening the control of chlorine content or oil con-
tent in the raw materials for sintering, but different means of control are necessary for 
decreasing dioxins produced in the second stage. A practical effective means may be 
an appropriate control of the BTP position. There should be a control for setting a 
target BTP on the sinter cake discharge side within the tolerances of the operating 
conditions in terms of product yield, strength, exhaust gas temperature, etc. For high-
productivity operation, BTP will be set on the utmost discharge side right from the 
start since the sintering rate cannot permit otherwise. For low-­productivity operation, 
however, BTP may be set on the raw mixture feeding side of the strand as in the test 
being discussed. The operational results clearly show that the BTP position is varied 
on account of different factors and seem to indicate that holding the BTP stable on 
the discharge side can constrain dioxin release to a certain extent.
5.3.10  Countermeasures for Dioxin Reduction
5.3.10.1  Dioxin Reduction by SCR Catalyst
Mou (2005) conducted a pilot-scale test of dioxins reduction by using SCR 
catalysts in the No. 4 sinter plant of China Steel Corporation in year 2005. A test 
rig was installed adjacent to a sinter plant SCR de-NOx reactor (Fig. 5.16). Three 
types of catalysts had been tested: (1) plate-type WO3/V2O5/TiO2, (2) plate-type 
MoO3/V2O5/TiO2, and (3) honeycomb-type (WO3/V2O5/TiO2) + (Pt/Al). The testing 
temperatures were set at 250, 290, 310, and 330 °C. The testing results are shown 
in Table 5.2 and summarized in the possible mechanism as follows:
	1.	 Dioxin reduction efficiency reduced as the operational temperature increased.
	2.	 The test results showed the reduction efficiency is around ~28 to ~45 %. The 
three types of catalyst removal efficiencies were all similar.
J. Mou and R.J. Morrison

93
	3.	 The gas phase dioxin removal efficiency was higher than the solid phase.
	4.	 During tests where dust accumulation on the catalyst surface was observed, these 
dusts contained rich KCl (source for Cl), unburnt coke breeze fines (source for 
C), and Fe2O3 (de novo catalyst); moreover, the SCR operation temperature is 
around 300–350 °C; hence, the surface of catalysts provided a suitable de novo 
synthesis environment. It was therefore assumed that dioxins formed on the sur-
face of catalyst as the temperature stepped into the reaction window.
	5.	 The removal efficiency of low chlorine (4, 5) dioxins was higher than high chlo-
rine (6–8) dioxins. The removal efficiency of PCDD was higher than PCDF.
	6.	 Sampling data showed the toxicity of PCDF was about 10 times that of PCDD.
5.3.10.2  Dioxin Removal by Lignite Coke Absorption
Mou and Passler (2008) conducted a demonstration scale test of lignite pack bed 
filter for dioxin removal in China Steel No. 2 sinter plant. The filter bed system is 
equipped with a long tube container with the L × W × H = 6.05 × 2.43 × 2.90 m3. It

was a module design with the gas treating capability of 60,000 m3 gas per hr per 
unit, and it could be connected in parallel in different units according to the required 
gas handling amount. The reason for choosing lignite coke was the pore diameter 
more suitable to trap the dioxin molecules than active carbon, and it also was more 
noncombustible than active carbon.
The basic concept was to deploy the lignite coke on top of an inclined screen net 
for around 10 cm; waste gases passing through the packed bed and those dioxins, 
submicron particles, alkali chlorides, sulfates, etc. were trapped on/in the packed 
bed. Purging air was introduced for backwashing when the pressure drop reached a 
certain level due to caking on the pack bed; this caking together with upper layer 
lignite coke was removed by screw discharger, and the fresh lignite coke continues 
to supplement on the pack bed. Figures 5.17, 5.18, 5.19, and 5.20 show the working 
principle of the filter bed.

For 3-month continuous testing, dioxin average removal efficiency reached 
around 98 % (Table 5.3). It is believed that the filter bed device is a potential appa-
ratus for dioxins, submicron particle, and acid gas removal.

 Abstract   The iron- and steelmaking is the largest energy consuming in the 
industrial sectors. The high energy consumption is associated with emission of CO 2 
and other pollutants. The most common ironmaking process used in the world is the 
blast furnace which contributes around 70 % of the world’s steel production. 
Recently, blast furnace has undergone tremendous modiﬁ cations and improvements 
to reduce the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The modiﬁ cations are being 
focused on two main approaches: (1) development of top charging materials and (2) 
injections of auxiliary fuels through blast furnace tuyeres. The present chapter will 
discuss the recent modiﬁ cations and development in the top charging burden and 
how it could participate in minimizing the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions 
for more efﬁ cient and sustainable iron and steel industry. The injection of auxiliary

fuels will be discussed in details in another chapter. The enhancement of burden 
material quality and its charging mode into the blast furnace has resulted in a smooth 
and efﬁ cient operation. Recently, the usage of nut coke in the modern blast furnace 
is accompanied by higher production and lower reducing agent rates. An efﬁ cient 
recycling of in-plant ﬁ nes by its conversion into briquettes with proper mechanical 
strength is applied in some blast furnaces to exploit the iron- and carbon-rich resi-
dues. Nowadays, novel composite agglomerates consist of iron ores and alternative 
carbonaceous materials represent a new trend for low-carbon blast furnace with 
lower dependence on the conventional burden materials. The recent investigations 
demonstrated that the novel composites are able to reduce the thermal reserve zone 
temperature in the blast furnace and consequently enhance the carbon utilization 
through its higher reactivity compared to fossil fuels. The top charging of bio- 
reducers and hydrogen-rich materials into the blast furnace is one of interesting 
innovations to mitigate the CO 2 emissions. Although some of previous approaches 
are recently applied in the modern blast furnace, others are still under intensive 
discussions to enhance its implementations.  
6.1  Introduction 
 Blast furnace (BF) is considered to be the most important ironmaking unit. During 
2014–2015 BF worldwide produced about 1155 million tonnes compared to 55 mil-
lion tonnes by the  direct reduced iron (DRI)   (  www.worldsteel.org    ). For the foresee-
able future, it will continue to occupy a primary position because of its high efﬁ ciency 
on both reactions and heat exchange. BF is a continuously operating shaft furnace 
based on the counterﬂ ow principle.  Carbon-bearing materials and burden are charged 
from the top as distinct layers. Charge materials descend under the inﬂ uence of grav-
ity. Through tuyeres (in the lower part of the furnace), hot blast is injected. The hot 
blast reacts with carbon in front of tuyere, forming carbon monoxide at high tem-
perature. The hot ascending gases including carbon monoxide help in reduction of 
iron oxide as well as  heating and melting   of the descending materials. At the bottom 
of the hearth, molten iron and slag are collected and tapped (Biswas  1981 ). 
 The BF can be generally divided into three  thermal zones  ; ﬁ rst is the preheating 
zone where the temperature of the ascending gases drops from 800 to 1000 °C down 
to 100–250 °C, and the raw materials heated up from room temperature up to 800–
950 °C. Several reactions take place in this zone like the indirect reduction of hematite 
to magnetite and magnetite to wustite. Other reactions which occur in the zone are 
release of water vapor due to drying as well as that from hydrates, decomposition of 
carbonates (not calcium carbonates), deposition of carbon back from the ascending 
gas, etc. It is worth mentioning that the coke is relatively inert in this upper zone; it is 
heated up and loses its moisture and most of its volatile matter. In efﬁ cient furnace, by 
the time the iron reaches the thermal reserve zone (second zone), reduction would 
have completed and the gas composition would be corresponding that of wustite-Fe

equilibrium. At the bottom of the  thermal reserve zone  , the indirect reduction of 
wustite to metallic iron takes place. This zone takes about 50 % of the BF height. The 
temperature of this zone is depended on the start of the gasiﬁ cation reaction, i.e., the 
coke reactivity. This zone is followed by the direct reduction zone where carbon gas-
iﬁ cation reaction rates are high, and the melting zone in which the molten material 
temperature approaches 1400–1450 °C. The ore softens in the cohesive zone, while 
the coke lumps act as windows for the gas to ascend through. The active coke zone 
starts below the cohesive zone and extends up to the raceway. The  deadman zone   
consists of loosely packed coke through which droplets of melted material drip down 
to the hearth. In front of the tuyeres, the blast kinetic energy creates a semi void region 
with rapidly moving coke particles being combusted termed as the raceway. 
Dissolution of carbon into iron takes place in the melting zone when the metallic iron 
gets in direct contact with coke. The center area of coke zone which is known as stag-
nant coke zone extends through hearth and deadman zone and consists of densely 
packed coke. The most dominant reactions taking place in the BF and a schematic 
diagram showing the area where these reactions are most likely occurring are depicted 
in Fig.  6.1 (Mousa  2010 ; Peacey and Davenport  1979 ; Geerdes et al.  2015 ).
 The  charging system in modern BF is extremely important as it ensures good 
distribution of coke and burden materials inside the furnace which signiﬁ cantly 
affect the furnace performance and the productivity. The charging proﬁ le is an 
important tool for changing the gas distribution and to overcome the furnace irregu-
larities such as uneven material distribution, channeling, scabs, scaffolds, hanging, 
etc. Bad distribution of feeding materials and ascending gases will result in poor 
permeability and limited access for the reducing gases through the burden materials 
resulting in poor reduction of descending oxides and thus consuming more carbon

down there in the dripping zone through direct reduction. Direct reduction does not 
result only in high carbon consumption but also in weakening the coke and adversely 
affecting the furnace permeability. An ongoing research activity at  MiMeR labora-
tory, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden , showed that different distribution of 
feeding material can also have a signiﬁ cant impact on holding capacity of the 
descending bed for the generated ﬁ nes. In modern blast furnace, the top is closed as 
they tend to operate under high top pressure. 
 Modern blast furnaces are usually equipped with  “bell-less top” charging system 
invented by Paul Wurth in 1972. The bell-less top system allows easier burden dis-
tribution through a rotating chute and consequently uniform distribution of voidage 
and particles of charged materials inside the furnace. It is worth mentioning that 
proper feeding material distribution ensures good permeability and hence higher 
productivity, higher CO utilization, and thus lower coke rate. It also enhances the 
burden descent and lowers the thermal loads on the walls which ensure smooth 
operation, less heat losses, and longer refractory lifetime (Pandey and Yadav  1999 ). 
6.2  Conventional  Top Charging Materials 
 In the early days, BFs were quite often relied on charcoal and lump ores. Later the 
charcoal has been replaced by coke. Recently, BFs have grown considerably. In the 
early days, the hearth diameter was 4–5 m with annual production rate of 100,000 
tonnes hot metal mostly from lump ore and coke. Nowadays, the bigger blast fur-
naces have hearth diameter up to 14–15 m with annual production rate of 3–4 million 
tonnes hot metal (Geerdes et al.  2015 ). The burden materials have changed from 
lump ore to more efﬁ cient materials like sinter and pellets. The reductant materials 
have developed as well from 100 % coke operation to use other injectant materials 
through tuyeres. Attempts are being made to charge other alternative reducing agents 
from the top along with burden material like biomass-based materials, plastics, etc. 
(Ahmed et al.  2014 ). Modern blast furnaces favor high Fe content in ore burden. 
Higher grade of iron ore burden can be realized after physical beneﬁ ciation process. 
This consequently creates more ﬁ ne materials. These ﬁ ne ores are too problematic to 
the BF operation. As a consequent, sintering and pelletizing as agglomeration pro-
cesses are favored. Sinter constitutes 70–80 % of the iron-bearing material charged 
into the modern blast furnaces all over the world, while other blast furnaces in Europe 
apply 100 % iron ore pellets. A comparison of ferrous burden composition applied in 
1990 and 2008 EU-15 is given in Fig.  6.2 (Luengen et al.  2012 ).
 The quality demands for the blast furnace burden materials include chemical 
composition as well as mechanical durability. The chemical composition must meet 
the end product properties. The mechanical durability of the burden is related to the 
material property in cold, hot, and during reduction to ensure the furnace  permeability 
and consequently good performance and less operational difﬁ culties. The reduc-
ibility of the iron ores is for large extent controlled by how easy the reducing gases 
can get into the iron oxide particles. The intrinsic reducibility of the burden material

becomes a less important factor if no sufﬁ cient  gas is transported to the reaction 
front and the produced gas is moved away from the reaction site. Ore burden materi-
als are generally characterized by chemical composition, size and size distribution, 
cold strength, reduction, reduction disintegration, swelling, softening, and melting. 
 Although BF is a well-established and highly efﬁ cient process, there is a demand 
to enlarge its adaptability to reuse the in-plant residues and apply alternative reduc-
ing agents and novel charging composites. These modiﬁ cations become essential to 
reduce the energy consumption and minimize the  greenhouse gas emission (GHG) 
while keeping or even improving the furnace productivity. Therefore, the major part 
of this chapter will be devoted to brief the state of the art of attempts being made to 
meet these demands. Since these attempts are mostly based on decreasing the ther-
mal reserve zone temperature and consequently shift the whole process toward 
lower CO/CO 2 , it is more convenient to ﬁ rst discuss the fundamentals and different 
ways of shifting the process toward lower CO/CO 2 before discussing the develop-
ments of burden materials and alternative reducing agents.  
6.3  Shifting the Process Toward Lower CO/CO 2 
 Enhancing the  reducibility of the ore is always advantageous for blast furnace oper-
ation, especially in enhancing the productivity as well as smoother operation. If the 
ore can be reduced faster, then the production rate per unit volume of the furnace 
termed as productivity of the furnace can be enhanced. There is a possibility for 
further increase in the BF efﬁ ciency from the viewpoint of thermodynamics. If the 
rate of iron oxide reduction could be increased and the starting temperature of gas-
iﬁ cation reaction could be lowered, further increase in the efﬁ ciency of blast furnace 
process could be expected (Kashiwaya et al.  2001 ). 
 It is well known that an efﬁ cient blast furnace operation is characterized by a 
well-developed thermal reserve zone with a  chemical reserve zone at the top of it.

This is illustrated using the  RIST diagram in Fig.  6.3 (Peacey and Davenport  1979 ). 
The point “W” corresponding to the chemical reserve zone is marked both in the 
RIST diagram and in the Fe-O equilibrium diagram. When the thermal reserve zone 
is equal to the W point (wustite-iron reduction equilibrium point) of the RIST dia-
gram, the shaft efﬁ ciency of a blast furnace becomes 100 %, theoretically. In order 
to achieve that efﬁ ciency of furnace inner reactions, it would be necessary to shift 
the operation curve (the dotted line AP in Fig.  6.3 ) toward the W point, maintaining 
the present temperature condition of the thermal reserve zone unchanged (A → B), 
or to lower the thermal reserve zone temperature, shift the W point toward the high 
 η CO side ( η CO = CO 2 /(CO + CO 2 )).
 Decreasing coke consumption in the blast furnace by means of shifting the equi-
librium point of  FeO-Fe reduction affecting decrease of thermal reserve zone tem-
perature is being discussed intensively (Ariyama et al.  2005 ; Schmöle and Lüngen 
 2005 ; Nomura et al.  2005 ). Thermal reserve zone temperature is determined by the 
heat balance between the endothermic gasiﬁ cation reaction of coke and the heat 
supply from the gas ﬂ ow. Thus, improving the gasiﬁ cation reaction, which is 
 basically determined by the carbonaceous material reactivity, will reduce the ther-
mal reserve zone temperature (Ueda et al.  2009a ).

et al.  2006 )

 Using two facing sheets of  hematite and graphite , the coupling between reduction 
and gasiﬁ cation was conﬁ rmed (Kashiwaya et al.  2001 ). Since mass transfer is a 
decisive variable in the reduction reaction inside the furnace, the degree of contact 
between the carbonaceous material and iron oxide would signiﬁ cantly affect the 
overall reaction rate. If the degree of contact between carbonaceous material and 
iron ore could be increased up to an ideal level, the starting temperature of the solu-
tion loss (gasiﬁ cation) reaction could be lowered (Kasai and Matsui  2004 ). Then, 
the equilibrium concentration at  FeO-Fe reduction reaction will be shifted to higher 
CO gas utilization efﬁ ciency, resulting in the improved CO gas utilization efﬁ ciency 
at the furnace top and decreasing the reducing agents rate. This phenomenon is 
further explained by means of the Fe-C-O equilibrium diagram (Fig.  6.4 ) and the 
RIST diagram (Fig.  6.3 ). It was demonstrated experimentally that this phenomenon 
could be reached by using high reactive coke or carbon composite iron ore agglom-
erate (Kasai and Matsui  2004 ). Consequently, the gasiﬁ cation reaction could be 
improved, and the permeability and heat balance could also be improved, resulting 
in better performance under low reducing agent rate (Sawayama et al.  2009b ).
 It is worth mentioning that it would be a mistake to think that carbon consump-
tion can be directly decreased and the process can be shifted toward the ideal blast 
furnace operation by just lowering the starting temperature of FeO-Fe reaction. 
However, decreasing the  thermal reserve zone temperature using high reactive coke 
may intensify heat exchange and direct reduction in the lower zone. Carbon saving 
at lower reserve zone temperature can be realized only under certain conditions, for 
example, complete reduction of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 at lower temperature such that no

hematite or magnetite reaches the wustite reduction zone (Babich et al.  2009 ). 
Peacey and Davenport ( 1979 ) have presented predictions of carbon and blast 
requirements based on different reserve zone temperatures (Table  6.1 ). Their pre-
dictions are based on minimum heat demand (production of Fe, 5 % C from wustite, 
no ﬂ ux, gangue nor heat losses) and blast temperature 1123 °C assumptions.
 Ways of Shifting the Process Toward Lower CO/CO 2   The use of highly reactive or 
activated carbonaceous materials is suggested as one of the ways to reach this goal. 
Small-sized (Babich et al.  2009 ) or highly reactive coke usage signiﬁ cantly improves 
the gasiﬁ cation reaction (Naito et al.  2006 ).  Coke reactivity can be enhanced signiﬁ -
cantly by means of catalytic effect (Babich et al.  2009 ). The activation energy could 
be lowered and the gasiﬁ cation rate increased on applying alkali vapor. When CRI 
(carbon reactivity index) is low, the catalytic effect appears strongly and almost 
disappears on using high reactive coke as well as on rising temperature. Fe and Ca 
are promising as catalysts to improve the coke reactivity at the condition of the 
thermal reserve zone in BF (Iguchi and Takada  2004 ). There are two basic ways to 
apply the catalyst to the coke (Nomura et al.  2005 ; Nomura et al.  2007 ): the post 
addition and the pre-addition of catalyst to the coke and coal blend, respectively. 
The selection of a suitable catalyst  addition method could shift the reaction mode to 
a more homogeneous one at a lower reaction temperature, leading to an increase in 
the postreaction strength (Reddy et al.  1991 ). Additives such as Li 2 O, NaCO 3 , etc. 
can signiﬁ cantly affect the reduction rate by enhancing the rate of  carbon gasiﬁ ca-
tion (Iguchi and Takada  2004 ; Reddy et al.  1991 ; Rao and Han  1984 ). 
6.4  Recently Developed Top Charging Materials 
6.4.1  Active Coke 
 Coke which is the reducing agent in blast furnace ironmaking is known to provide the 
structure through which the gas can ascend and distribute through the whole descend-
ing burden. Coke is a solid and permeable material up to very high temperature. Down

there in the blast furnace below the melting zone, coke is the only solid material. So 
the total weight of the blast furnace content is supported by the coke. Therefore, blast 
furnace requires special coke size as well as relatively low reactive coke to maintain 
the furnace permeability in lower part of the shaft (Lacroix et al.  2001 ). In addition, 
the size distribution should be narrow to maintain a stable operation and low coke rate 
(Podkorytov et al.  2009 ). The required size is in the range of 40–60 mm which can be 
achieved by screening the produced coke, the screening results in generation of under-
sieve coke which known as nut coke. Due to difﬁ culties and GHG emissions to pro-
duce coke, there are several attempts that have been carried out to utilize this 
undersieve coke or nut coke in the blast furnace which of course will affect the fur-
nace permeability and operation smoothness as well as productivity. 
 Several studies have been conducted to address the effect of charging nut coke 
with the burden material on the process efﬁ ciency and hence the productivity 
(Mousa et al.  2010b ,  2011 ; Mousa  2010 ; Mousa et al.  2010a ; Babich et al.  2008 ; 
Babich et al.  2009 ). The attempts started by charging this undersieve coke with dif-
ferent ratios (5–30 %) within the coke layer. It resulted in reducing the  productivity 
by 0.9–6.5 %. It also led to nonuniform distribution of ascending gases (Nikitin 
et al.  1999 ). Other researchers (Loginov et al.  1976 ,  1977 ) have suggested charging 
the nut coke along with the burden material. The idea was successfully tested and 
followed by a good improvement in the blast furnace productivity and lowered coke 
rate. Figure  6.5 depicts how the size as well as its distribution affects the furnace 
permeability and liquid drainage.

   This success has inspired researchers to conduct an intensive research to study the 
effect of nut coke on different process parameters like permeability, reducibility, total 
coke consumption, etc. (Babich et al.  2009 ; Mousa et al.  2010a ,  b ,  2011 ; Babich et al. 
 2008 ; Yaroshevskii et al.  2000 ; Watakabe et al.  2006 ). One of the important issues that 
should be taken care of is the uniform mixing of nut coke in the ore layer to maintain 
proper gas distribution and maintain the required permeability especially in the cohesive 
zone (Nikitin et al.  1999 ). Mixing of nut coke within the ore bed was very effective to 
increase the rate of carbon solution loss (Kasai and Matsui  2004 ). This further decreases 
the gasiﬁ cation reaction temperature which consequently decreased the lower limit of 
the thermal reserve zone temperature, thus decreasing the total coke consumption (Kasai 
and Matsui  2004 ). Figure  6.6  shows the relation between the thermal reserve zone tem-
perature and coke rate consumption. Mixing of nut coke in the ore layer is not only 
expected to improve the solution loss reaction but also expected to protect the lump coke 
from gasiﬁ cation and consequently abrasion (Sawayama et al.  2009a ).
 The reactivity of small-sized coke was further increased by means of surface 
coating with compounds that contains hematite and  Ca . It was found that activated 
nut coke shows even higher rates of gasiﬁ cation compared to original ones. The 
activation was more pronounced for coke with low coke reactivity index (CRI) val-
ues and further reduces the coke rate consumption (Ökvist et al.  1999 ). 
6.4.2  In-Plant Fines 
 One more promising reducing agent is iron- and steelmaking residues. Large quanti-
ties of residues are annually generated during iron and steel production, a signiﬁ cant 
amount having potential of being valuable resources of carbon. Efforts have been

made during the past decades to return generated by-products as substitutes to raw 
materials in the steelmaking process. Part of the residues are therefore today recy-
cled, mainly to the sinter strand but also to the blast furnace in the form of a cold-
bonded briquette. Injection of dry BF dust into the BF is practiced at SSAB in 
Sweden. However, there are still substantial amounts of carbon-containing residues 
deposited. Examples of the latter include sludge from the blast furnace and sludge 
from the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), for which the recycling is limited due to impu-
rity elements (zinc, lead, alkalis) or physical properties (particle size, wet material). 
 Most of the residues from the integrated steel industry are today recycled in the 
process either via the sinter plant or in cold-bonded agglomerates. Residues are also 
recycled through other applications outside the process, e.g., in road construction and 
in the cement industry or in external processes as the rotary hearth furnace (RHF) 
processes. When considering residues rich in carbon produced at the integrated steel 
plant, the blast furnace is the production unit responsible for the production of these. 
There are two such residues, namely, the  blast furnace dust (BF dust) and the blast 
furnace sludge (BF sludge). As the dust is dry, it is more convenient to recycle. 
Typical carbon content for the dust from a production site in Sweden is 43.6 % mak-
ing the residue eligible for utilization as reduction agent in the blast furnace. When 
operating the blast furnace on iron ore pellets, all the dry dust may be recycled 
through injection in the tuyeres and by  cold-bonded agglomeration   (Grip  2005 ). 
 The carbon content of a few different blast furnace sludges is reported to be in 
the range of 18.5–33.0 % (Itoh and Fieser  1982 ; Heijwegen and Kat  1984 ; Steer and 
Grifﬁ ths  2013 ; Vereš et al.  2012 ), making this residue eligible for utilization as 
reducing agent as well. However, problems arise when attempting to recycle both 
the dust and sludge from the gas cleaning system back to the blast furnace. The 
main issue is the accumulation of  zinc in the furnace which may lead to high zinc 
loads which in turn disturb the smooth running of the process (Biswas  1981 ). An 
additional problem is the cost related to drying of the sludge prior to recycling. 
 Typically, the dominating output of zinc from the furnace is through the gas 
phase, in which the extent is determined by, e.g., the top pressure operated at the 
furnace. Therefore, in order to recycle both residues leaving the gas cleaning equip-
ment of the blast furnace, a proper way of zinc removal has to be introduced. This 
can be achieved by upgrading the sludge using, e.g., physical separation, hydromet-
allurgical, or pyrometallurgical routes. 
 Upgrading of blast furnace sludge using a hydrocyclone has been demonstrated in 
previous studies (Butterworth et al.  1996 ; Heijwegen and Kat  1984 ; Itoh and Fieser 
 1982 ). Butterworth et al. ( 1996 ) have reported the results of laboratory and pilot 
plant trials using a one-stage hydrocyclone to remove zinc from the sludge. In aver-
age the pilot plant trials suggested that 66 % of the sludge can be recovered and 
recycled back to the process while removing 89 % of the zinc. Itoh and Fieser ( 1982 ) 
report that the hydrocyclone can be used in full-scale operation to remove zinc from 
the blast furnace sludge. The presented results suggest that the underﬂ ow, low in 
zinc, is enriched in both carbon and iron. Although some losses of carbon are realized 
through the  zinc removal , a fraction with higher carbon content than the original 
sludge may be recycled and utilized for its iron content and reducing properties.

112
 Another way to reduce the zinc content of the blast furnace sludge is by leaching. 
This has been realized in different leaching reagents such as sulfuric acid (Vereš 
et al.  2012 ), hydrochloric acid (Van Herck et al.  2000 ), and carboxylic acids (Steer 
and Grifﬁ ths  2013 ). The leaching of blast furnace sludge in 0.5 M sulfuric acid 
showed that almost 88 % of zinc can be recovered with an iron loss of about 9 % 
(Vereš et al.  2012 ). A pilot plant leaching experiment was conducted by Van Herck 
et al. ( 2000 ). The leaching was performed with hydrochloric acid under oxidizing 
conditions. The plant successfully removed an average of over 95 % of the zinc in 
the different sludges tested in the study. 
 On the other hand, effective utilization of carbon-rich integrated steelmaking 
residues based on pyrometallurgical treatments has been also investigated 
(Robinson  2005 ; Su et al.  2004 ). Producing agglomerates with self-reducing prop-
erties which is used further to produce DRI (direct reduced iron) has previously 
been suggested as a promising recycling method for the dust and sludge instead of 
landﬁ lls. Production of DRI by heat treatment also contributes to signiﬁ cant reduc-
tion of  Zn  , which enables introduction of carbon-rich by-products with high Zn 
contents to the blast furnace.   
6.5  Novel Top Charging Materials (Iron Ore-Carbon 
Composite) 
 Composite pellets (Dutta and Ghosh  1994 ),  carbon composite agglomerates (CCAs) , 
briquettes (CCB), and self-reducing agglomerates, all refer to carbon- bearing materi-
als mixed with iron-bearing materials into agglomerates. It can be mixtures of ﬁ ne 
iron ore (hematite, magnetite, dust and pre-reduced iron-bearing ore ﬁ ne, etc.) and 
ﬁ ne carbonaceous materials (ﬁ ne coke, ﬁ ne coal, charcoal, char, etc.) adding some 
binding agents in most cases (Chu et al.  2004 ). Possibly, using these agglomerates in 
blast furnace as well as in other  ironmaking processes  , one can derive the following 
beneﬁ ts simultaneously, i.e., (1) usage of alternate carbonaceous materials having 
signiﬁ cant hydrogen which can replace expensive coke like plastics and biomass and 
(2) shifting the  BF operation toward lower CO/CO 2 ratio by shifting the thermal 
reserve zone to lower temperatures as explained earlier. 
 Therefore, in the context of process optimization, energy saving, waste recy-
cling, and environmental concerns, CCAs have been attracting much attention as 
future raw materials for ironmaking. For blast furnace operation with CCAs or 
 CCBs , the following advantages are being envisaged (Chu et al.  2004 ):
 –  Decrease the energy consumption and environmental loads through the less 
dependency on sinter and coke.  
 –  The effective use of noncoking coal, and iron-bearing dust and sludge in steel 
industry, extends the variety of raw materials and promotes resource recycling.  
 –  The short distance between close-packed ﬁ ne iron ore and carbonaceous materi-
als in the agglomerates ensures fast reduction reaction of iron oxide.  
H.M. Ahmed et al.

113
 –  Furthermore, carbon gasiﬁ cation reaction and iron ore reductions are mutually 
accelerated and occur at lower temperature due to the coupling effect (Dutta and 
Ghosh  1994 ; Kasai and Matsui  2004 ). 
 In light of the above, in the following sections, the current status and gaps in 
understanding of such composites as well as challenges and research needed for 
realizing them as an effective raw material for ironmaking have been presented. 
6.5.1  Producing of Iron Ore-Carbon Composites 
 Carbon composites are made in the form of  pellets (cold bonded with and/or with-
out binder) or briquettes (which can be either hot or cold pressed). Speciﬁ c studies 
on the production aspects of these pellets require further improvement, especially as 
usage in blast furnace calls for higher qualities in terms of strength. Currently, usage 
of cold-bonded ordinary pellets (not containing carbon) itself pose difﬁ culties in 
terms of accommodating them in signiﬁ cant proportion for blast furnace process 
owing to their poor strength. 
 Possibly, improving the binding system could signiﬁ cantly reduce the accompanying 
operational difﬁ culties that can arise from low strength composites. Experience on 
ordinary pellet production over the past decades has led to the identiﬁ cation of a num-
ber of criteria that a binder must satisfy (Qiu et al.  2003 ). They include good  mechani-
cal properties , while they are green, dry, and ﬁ red pellets, e.g., deformation under load, 
resistance to fracture by impact and by compression, and resistance to abrasion. 
 Bentonite is the most commonly used binder in iron ore pelletization and signiﬁ -
cantly improves physical properties of the pellets. However, there are some draw-
backs with the use of bentonite. The most remarkable is the contamination of the 
product with gangue (silica). For example, addition of 1 % bentonite to an iron ore 
concentrate results in a lowering of acid pellet iron content by 0.6 % (Souza et al. 
 1984 ). In the case of direct reduction pellets, every percent of acid gangue addition is 
associated with an increased energy consumption of 30 kWh (Heerema et al.  1989 ). 
 Cold-bonded pellets (CBPs) containing metallurgical by-products and cement as 
binder have been investigated (Robinson  2008 ). The effect of particle size distribution 
and hydration extent on the cold strength of CBPs was carefully studied. They have 
concluded that an optimal blend of ﬁ ne and coarse BOF sludge in CBPs signiﬁ cantly 
improves the particle size distribution as well as bonding during hydration therefore 
signiﬁ cantly improves the cold strength. On the other hand, several experiments were 
conducted with an aim to study the  strength development with a focus on swelling 
(swelling has two consequences: loss of strength and degradation or disintegration 
during reduction) of briquettes of steel industry by-products during curing and reduc-
tion (Singh  2002 ). The briquette swelling was found to be signiﬁ cant only when the 
average particle size increases as well as in the presence of cement. However, swell-
ing is signiﬁ cantly hindered when reduction of briquettes is carried out under load. 
Researchers (Adolfsson et al.  2008 ) have tried even to utilize steelmaking by-product 
(Ladle slag) in CBP as a supplement and/or partial substitute for ordinary cement.

 Mantovani and Takano ( 2000 ) studied the behavior of self-reducing pellets at 
room temperature and upon heating. They have produced pellets of  EAF dust with 
total iron between 30 and 50 %, coal ﬁ nes (70.5 % ﬁ xed carbon, 15.4 % ash, and 
17 % volatile matter), and additives (commercial Portland cement and CaCO 3 ) then 
left in open air for 28 days for gaining strength to handle. They could get cold 
strength up to 60 N/pellet for 5 % cements containing pellet, which is still not 
enough for charging in shaft furnaces. They found that pellets with Portland cement 
and low moisture content present low decrepitation. At 600 °C the formed hydrated 
component started to decompose, and consequently it loses its strength. In addition, 
at 1000–1100 °C the strength is critical due to swelling. 
 In addition, during  reduction of CCA , large voidage is created by the consump-
tion of carbonaceous materials and can lead to low strength values in the pellets 
during reduction. Therefore, special attention was devoted to understand the strength 
development in CCAs during reduction. Talano and Mourao ( 2001 ) studied the 
strength development of self-reducing pellets at high temperatures. The pellets face 
sharp decrease in their compression strength from room temperature to 900–950 °C 
due to the  decomposition of the hydrates, which are the main components of the 
cold strengthening mechanism of curing when cement is used. As the temperature 
increases, iron starts sintering and therefore the strength increases (Adolfsson et al. 
 2008 ). Higher strength at room temperature correlates generally well with higher 
strengths at elevated temperatures. 
 Unlike  inorganic binders , organic binders have no side effect on iron ore grade. 
It also improves the wettability as well as the chemical bonding and results in strong 
and heat-resistant organic chain skeleton. Qiu et al. ( 2003 ) investigated the func-
tions and the molecular structure of organic binders for iron ore pelletization (no 
available data for CCA in literature) based on the basic principles of molecular 
design, interface chemistry, polymer science, and failure model of binding system. 
The authors suggest “Funa” as one of the best organic binders which is prepared 
from lignite or weathered  coal and with humates as major constitutes. Min et al. 
( 2009 ) proved the possibility of applying an organic synthetic binder referred SHN 
to iron ore pellets instead of inorganic binders (bentonite). Table  6.2 shows com-
parison between different binders and the effect of the pellet compression strength.
 Another way of improving the agglomerate strength is by producing iron ore coal 
briquettes by hot pressing. The  ﬂ uidity phenomenon of coal at temperature 350–600 °C 
can be utilized in gaining high density and high strength without the addition of any bind-
ing materials (Matsui et al.  2003 ). Utilization of thermal plasticity of coal is being under 
development as agglomerate without binder. Compared with other  carbon-containing 
agglomerates , this briquette showed better reducing performance, lower cost, and higher 
strength due to thermal plasticity of coal (Chu et al.  2004 ). Hayashi ( 2009 ) has presented 
the behavior of coal composite iron ore briquettes at high temperatures. Also, this kind of 
binderless agglomerates offers less slag ratio and enables a high heat transfer thus higher 
reaction rate. On studying the reaction behavior and softening and melting of such bri-
quettes (hot-pressed briquettes) under N 2 at 1400 °C, both density and cold crushing 
strength were increasing by increasing coal content in the briquettes. The thermal plastic-
ity of coal could provide a strength more than required for practical blast furnace. 
H.M. Ahmed et al.

115
Briquettes with high amount of coal tend to melt at higher temperatures, while those 
having less amount of coal tend to melt earlier due to the melting of slag containing unre-
duced iron oxide. Higher coal content briquettes will be preferred in blast furnace to avoid 
forming low melting slag then maintaining the furnace gas permeability. 
 Thus, current understanding in making CCAs suitable for blast furnace process is 
very limited.  Systematic and comprehensive studies on making of CCA suitable for 
blast furnace usage with new binders, carbonaceous, and iron ore sources followed 
by characterization in terms of strength and other metallurgical properties such as 
reducibility, swelling, pressure drop during reduction, etc. need to be conducted. 
While exploring new binders, care needs to be taken to not bring environmentally 
and metallurgically harmful elements such as P, S, As, etc., into the product. It should 
also not adversely affect iron grade and increase impurities such as silica.  
6.5.2  Reduction Behavior of Composite Pellets 
 Understanding the reactions occur within a composite pellet is very essential for its 
usage in blast furnace as well as in other ironmaking processes. Both experimental 
and theoretical investigations have been carried out along this direction. A possible 
behavior of CCB in a blast furnace is described by Chu et al. ( 2004 ) assuming that 
the CCB consists of hematite, carbon, and gangue (SiO 2 , CaO, MgO, and Al 2 O 3 ), and 
it ﬁ ts the  BF requirements mechanically and chemically. After charging CCB into 
blast furnace, it gets heated up through heat exchange with the ascending gases. 
When CCB temperature reaches to a particular level, reduction of hematite and mag-
netite starts to happen by ascending reducing gas from the thermal reserve zone. 
Reduction of wustite to metallic iron starts at the thermal reserve zone. As the CCB 
descends further and enters high-temperature zone, softening and melting of reduced 
iron, iron oxide (if still exists), and gangue in CCB occur. They have theoretically 
evaluated the effect of charging carbon composite agglomerates on blast furnace 
operation based on multiﬂ uid blast furnace model (Austin et al.  1997 ,  1998 ; Castro 
et al.  2000 ) under constant inﬂ ow conditions of blast and pulverized  coal and hot

metal temperature . On charging CCB, the predicted blast furnace productivity was 
improved, coke rate showed notable decrease, and total reducing agent rate tended to 
lower. For charging 30 % CCB, the productivity is increased by about 6.7 %; coke 
rate and reducing agent rate are reduced by 26.8 and 3.4 %, respectively, compared 
with base case without CCB charging. Kasai and Matsui ( 2004 ) have proposed a 
decrease in the thermal reserve zone temperature to 727 °C by charging of 20 % mass 
CCB which leads to a decrease in the reducing agent rate by 51 kg/tHM. 
 Several fundamental studies have been carried out on the  reduction kinetics   and 
mechanism of CCAs (Dutta and Ghosh  1994 ; Srinivasan and Lahiri  1977 ; Rao  1971 ; 
Sharma  1997 ; Fruehan  1977 ; Huang and Lu  1993 ). The main difference between 
iron ore agglomerates and CCAs is the rate-controlling step of the reduction of iron 
oxides. In case of iron ore agglomerates, the reduction takes place at gas-solid inter-
faces. Reducing gases move from the gas stream to the agglomerate surface then to 
the interior surface of the pores. In CCAs, carbon is present inside and so the chemi-
cal reaction can proceed very fast because of the large surface area available. 
Furthermore, mass transfer to and from reaction sites by gaseous diffusion could be 
also very fast because of the short traveling distance (Sun and Lu  1999a ,  b ). 
 Reaction Sequence   Reduction of  hematite goes via three stages of reduction, hema-
tite to magnetite then to wustite and ﬁ nally to metallic iron. The reduction to wustite 
is relatively faster than to iron because the equilibrium CO 2 -CO gas mixture con-
sists almost of CO 2 , while in the later the ratio becomes 0.4 (Fruehan  1977 ). The 
overall reaction and mechanism are represented by Eqs. ( 6.1 ), ( 6.2 ), and ( 6.3 ) and 
Fig.  6.7 . Solid-solid reaction (reduction of iron oxide by solid carbon in the solid 
state) can be visualized as the early beginning as a result of the contact points 
between iron oxide and carbon particles which can be there only when  gaseous 
products (CO and CO 2 ) are removed from the reaction system as fast as they are 
generated (Rao  1971 ). At thermodynamically reasonable temperatures, generation 
of carbon monoxide by carbon gasiﬁ cation (Eq.  6.3 ) and reduction of iron oxide by 
carbon monoxide (Eq.  6.1 ) start.

    Factors Affecting the Reaction Rate and the Rate-Controlling Step   The complexity of 
studying the reaction mechanism and kinetics of  self-reducing pellets or CCAs arises 
from the simultaneous reactions such as direct reduction of iron oxide, indirect reduc-
tion by CO, carbon gasiﬁ cation, etc. The reaction mechanism would vary signiﬁ cantly 
with the change of degree of oxidation and type of iron ore, carbon type, density, 
diameter, particle size, size distribution, state and area of contact, and state of crystal. 
These conditions will affect the chemical reaction, heat transfer, and gas diffusion 
(Khaki et al.  2002 ). Also, coal ﬂ uidity seems to affect the composite reactivity; the 
higher the coal ﬂ uidity, the higher the composite reactivity. Increasing the  ﬂ uidity 
improves the contact state between the iron ore and coal (Nishioka et al.  2009 ).  
 Srinivasan and Lahiri ( 1977 ) studied the reduction of a single hematite/carbon- 
containing pellet isothermally. Moisture and small amount of bentonite (1.5 %) were 
added as binder. They found that the  CO 2 /CO ratio tend to approach wustite equilib-
rium for low C/Fe 2 O 3  ratio and Boudouard equilibrium for high values of this ratio. A 
decrease in C/Fe 2 O 3 ratio leads to higher values of CO 2 /CO ratio and lower rate of 
carbon gasiﬁ cation decreasing the partial pressure of CO inside the sample. The 
results indicated a changeover in the reaction mechanism; Boudouard reaction seems 
to be initially rate limiting and the ﬁ nal stages being probably controlled by the reduc-
tion of wustite by CO. Fruehan ( 1977 ) and Rao ( 1971 ) have observed that the gasiﬁ ca-
tion reaction is dominating at low temperatures, while it turns to be controlled by 
wustite reduction at higher temperatures. In their studies, higher reaction rates were 
observed on using catalysts such as lithium and slower rates in the presence of inhibi-
tors such as sulfur reinforcing the argument of control by carbon gasiﬁ cation. 
 In fact, some investigators believed that the reaction of carbon composites is 
controlled by the gasiﬁ cation reaction at the initial stages, marked by large  activa-
tion energy , while the heat transfer is dominating at the later stages of the reduction 
marked by signiﬁ cant reduction in apparent activation energy (Ueda et al.  2009a ; 
Michishita and Tanaka  2010 ). In contradictory, some others (Sun and Lu  1999a ,  b ) 
have reported that the rate-controlling step is the heat transfer from surrounding to 
the outer surface then to the interior partially reacted system. They have referred 
their thinking to that there is no heat generation within the agglomerates; the rate of 
the overall reaction is determined by the  endothermic reaction (Eq.  6.3 ) which cools 
down the whole system. However, the approach of testing the possible rate- 
determining step by comparing the apparent activation energy values reported in the 
literature for the gasiﬁ cation, reduction reaction, or heat transfer may not be rele-
vant under non-isothermal conditions (Seaton et al.  1983 ).

6.6  Alternative  Reducing Agents 
 One of the most important beneﬁ ts that could be realized upon charging carbon 
composites into BF is the possibility and ﬂ exibility of top charging hydrogen-rich 
and bio-carbon carbonaceous materials. The fact that cost reduction as well as GHG 
emission is greatly affected by coke led to increase effort to reduce the coke con-
sumption rate in the BF. Production of 1 tonne of hot metal generates 1.5 tonne of 
CO 2 (Ng et al.  2012 ). The total worldwide CO 2 emission associated with blast fur-
nace ironmaking in 2014–2015 is about 1733 million tonnes which mainly comes 
from the use of fossil fuel (  www.worldsteel.org  ). 
6.6.1  Plastic Materials 
 One alternative reducing agent is plastic-containing materials. The demand for plas-
tics has grown signiﬁ cantly over the past decades and will continue. As carbon is a 
major constituent of waste plastics, clearly they have the potential to be a cheap and 
readily available auxiliary source of carbon. It has been reported that plastics have 
higher combustion and gasiﬁ cation efﬁ ciencies compared with pulverized coal 
(Hata et al.  2009 ). As plastics generally have high hydrogen content, these could 
also help reduce overall CO 2 gas emissions. Injection of waste plastic, excluding 
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), has been proposed to be a substitute reducing agent 
(Matsui et al.  2009 ), and injection of pure waste plastic and its behavior in a BF has 
been practiced (Grip  2005 ). Combustion and gasiﬁ cation behavior of waste plastic 
in a commercial BF is much different from that of pulverized coal. Plastic particles 
will be gasiﬁ ed completely in the raceway, which is claimed to improve process 
efﬁ ciency and sustain the gas permeability along the BF cohesive zone. 
 Plastics  X have been used as reductants in blast furnaces to some extent, although 
the amount of plastic waste used for this purpose is quite low in comparison to the 
worldwide generation of plastic waste. For use in blast furnaces and in steelmaking 
in general, it is required to have pure plastic materials, free from other metal content 
than iron. Elaborated upgrading processes exist today, where such pure plastic 
material fractions can be generated. However, the price for these pure plastic frac-
tions is comparably high in comparison to fossil carbon sources. 
 Upon heating plastics in absences of oxygen, it undergoes what is known as 
pyrolysis wherein the materials decompose into gases, oils, and chars. In pyrolysis 
of plastic polymers, macromolecular structures of polymeric materials are broken 
down into smaller molecules, and a wide range of hydrocarbons are formed. The 
quality of pyrolysis product and product distribution depends on temperature, resi-
dence time, and some other factors. Temperature is the most important operating 
variable. High temperature (>600 °C) favors the production of simple small gaseous 
molecules which is likely to be the case in the lower part of the BF shaft; low tem-
perature (<400 °C), which is likely to be the case in the upper part of the furnace, 
H.M. Ahmed et al.

leads to more viscous liquid products. The residual solid after pyrolysis is known as 
char in which solid carbon is the major constituent. Quite often the residual solid 
carbon has higher reactivity compared to carbon from coke which makes it easy to 
gasify at relatively lower temperature. 
6.6.2  Biomass 
 Biomass originating from forest residues, waste wood, etc. is today to large extent 
used or intended for use in a number of different applications in addition for use in 
production of pulp and paper. Some examples include district heating and produc-
tion of biofuel. A tough competition for the raw material can therefore be foreseen 
which might result in a price which is not competitive with coal. The price for char-
coal is today in Sweden not on a level which is competitive. Therefore, a lot of 
development is on the way to produce a partly carbonized or torreﬁ ed material. 
Again, as for the use of plastics as reductant, the possible interference of the vola-
tiles with the process and to what extent the volatiles can be utilized for reduction 
will be crucial for the possibility to use a torreﬁ ed material. 
 The use of charcoal as a reductant in smaller blast furnaces is widely practiced 
in, e.g., Brazil (Assis et al.  2015 ). Utilization of biomass in metallurgical processes 
has been studied by many researchers, e.g., revealing high reactivity and high 
 combustion degree for biomass (Janiana et al.  2009 ; Matsumura et al.  2008 ). 
Carbonization of biomass to attain selective removal of oxygen and improve the 
crushability, combustibility, and reactivity is required. The carbonized biomass char 
(400–1000 °C) would have the following features: (1) remaining duct structure of 
the wood, (2) larger speciﬁ c surface area, and (3) noncrystalline structure. The 
above features make it highly reactive. The gasiﬁ cation of biomass char is reported 
to be faster than that of coke in couple of dozen times (Ueda et al.  2009b ). The use 
of  biomass  as reducing agent for low-grade ores has been evaluated by Hata et al. 
( 2009 ) and Matsui et al. ( 2009 ), and its high efﬁ ciency has been proved. The low 
crushing strength of biomass-derived reductant does not allow a complete substitu-
tion of coke on large BFs. Possibly a smaller part of the coke added from the top can 
be exchanged with biomass. A more promising route to introduce biomass in a BF 
is as replacement for coal injected through the tuyeres. An additional limitation 
refers to the high alkali content. 
 The use of biomass as a reductant in ironmaking has been investigated in the last 
few decades. Vladimir investigated the iron ore reduction with biomass “saw dust” 
(Strezov  2006 ). Urvashi et al. (Srivastava et al.  2013 ) and Yasuaki et al. (Ueki et al. 
 2013 ) studied the behavior of self-reducing iron oxide wood biomass composite 
pellets in an electrically heated furnace. Results showed that high-quality pig iron 
nuggets not only can be produced at various temperatures; they can also be pro-
duced at very short residence times.

6.7  Summary 
 The present article has thoroughly discussed the recent modiﬁ cations and development 
which have been recently conducted in the blast furnace top charging materials to 
reduce energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The conventional top-charged bur-
den into the blast furnace including sinter, pellets, and metallurgical coke has reached 
a high level of quality that makes further improvement extremely hard. Although the 
blast furnace is nowadays working very close to the ideal conditions, there is still a 
demand to enlarge its adaptability to reuse the in-plant residues and maximize the 
overall efﬁ ciency. Successful trails have been done and implemented in the full-scale 
blast furnace on charging active/nut coke in the iron ore burden layers. The gas per-
meability, gas utilization, and iron ore reduction rate were improved which are 
accompanied by lower coke consumption and higher productivity of hot metal. The 
recycling of in-plant by-products and residues, which are rich with carbon and iron, 
into the blast furnace by its agglomeration in the form of sinter or cold-bonded 
agglomerates was succeeded in the mitigation of waste landﬁ ll and saving the virgin 
ores. Intensive work are being done on the partial replacement of conventional 
agglomerates with novel top charging materials including self- reducing pellets, car-
bon composite agglomerates, and carbon composite briquettes. The concept behind 
the novel composites is not only the efﬁ cient usage of the waste ﬁ nes from carbona-
ceous materials and iron ores but also to reduce the coke consumption by using 
alternative sources of carbon. The recent investigations demonstrated that such novel 
composites are able to shift the wustite-iron equilibrium to a higher CO gas utiliza-
tion at relatively lower temperature compared to that of conventional agglomerates. 
On the other hand, the mechanical strength of the novel composites is low for top 
charging into the blast furnace and required further investigations. The top charging 
of alternative reducing agents including waste plastics and biomass represent one of 
the promising ways to reduce the fossil fuel utilization in the blast furnace; however, 
the comparative prices and the required pretreatment of these materials represent the 
main challenges for its implementation.

Dangerous Emissions in Blast Furnace 
Operations
Lei Gan and Huining Zhang
Abstract  Blast furnace smelting is the dominant ironmaking method around the 
world. Blast furnace operations cover not only blast furnace smelting but also a set of 
auxiliary processes and equipments, including molten slag granulation, hot stoves and 
off-gas treatment systems. Dangerous emissions of SO2 and H2S are found in molten 
slag granulation sites; NOx are found from the hot stoves; heavy metals (mainly Zn 
and Pb) are found in the sludge and dust from off-gas treatment systems; fluorides are 
found in the off-gas. These emissions are generally in low concentrations. However, 
since the production of blast furnace is huge, the mass are still appreciable. The heavy 
metal emissions are mostly safely treated or recycled. However, few processes have 
been installed to treat emissions of H2S, SO2, NOx and fluorides.
7.1  Introduction
Blast furnace is the dominant metallurgical furnace for ironmaking around the world. The 
blast furnace iron production was 1.18 billion tons in 2014, accounting for 99 % of global 
production (World Steel Association 2015). In a modern blast furnace, the fuels (coke, 
charcoal), iron ores (sinter, pellet, lump ores) and fluxes (CaO, MgO, CaF2) are continu-
ously supplied through the top of the furnace, while hot blast with oxygen enrichment 
and pulverized coal is injected through tuyeres from the bottom of the furnace.
The product molten pig iron, or hot metal, is tapped from the bottom of the fur-
nace, along with by-product molten slag. The hot metal is delivered to the next sec-
tor for further processing. The molten slag is either granulated by water or slow 
cooled in the air depending on the purpose of utilization. The by-product off-gas, or

blast furnace gas (BFG), exits from the top of the furnace. After dedusting, it is 
distributed around the works and used as low-grade fuel for heating in hot stoves or 
for electricity generation in power plants.
The blast furnace system has also a set of auxiliary installations, including mol-
ten slag granulation, hot stoves and BFG treatment systems. Most of the molten slag 
is granulated in a water-quenching process. By slag granulation, the cooling and 
solidification speed is much faster than during dumpling and cooling in slag pit. The 
product usually is a fine slag sand with glassy structures, which is ideal for use in 
the cement industry (Shi et al. 2006). Gaseous sulphur emissions of H2S and SO2 are 
found during slag granulation process (Rehmus et al. 1973).
Each blast furnace has three or four associated hot stoves. The main function 
of the hot stoves is to provide the oxygen necessary for coke gasification and 
thus produce the gas that reduces iron oxides. The hot stoves preheat the air 
supplied to the blast furnace up to 1200 °C. The combustion temperature can 
reach higher than 1450 °C. NOx will form in such high temperatures (Chen 
et al. 2014).
The uncleaned BFG has a dust content of 20–40 g/m3. It has to be reduced to 
lower than 10 mg/m3 to meet the demand of fuel. The dedusting is finished in a wet 
or dry system. The collected sludge or dust can be recycled in the sintering sector 
due to its high Fe content. However, volatile heavy metals like zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb) 
also present in the sludge and dust. The dust and sludge with a high Zn or Pb content 
are usually not accepted as returns to the sinter plant or are only used in limited 
amounts (Remus et al. 2013). In addition, fluoride (HF and CaF2) can be found in 
the BFG if high fluorine charges are used.
In this chapter, the sources, emissions and abatement methods for gaseous sulphurs, 
NOx, heavy metals and fluorides in blast furnace operations are briefly overviewed.
7.2  H2S and SO2 Emissions
7.2.1  Source
The sulphur burden of the blast furnace in China is 4–8 kg/t hot metal. Most of the 
sulphur comes from coke and injected pulverized coal, accounting for about 85 % of 
the total input sulphur (Cai et al. 2008; Hu et al. 2008). Roughly 10 % of the input 
sulphur solutes into the hot metal. Most of the soluble sulphur will be removed in 
the following processes to improve qualities of steel. Roughly 5 % of the input sul-
phur enters into the BFG. The BFG will be combusted in the hot stove or power 
plant, with emission of SO2 into the atmosphere (Cai et al. 2008).
Majority of the burden sulphur is absorbed by molten slags. However, the sulphur 
in the slag is not necessarily stable; it may be released into the atmosphere in the form 
of gaseous sulphur during processing of molten slag. The molten slag can be either 
water-quenched to granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) or slowly cooled to lump 
slag. The sulphur in the molten slag is mostly in the form of S2- or sulphide. The

sulphide is generally stable in neutral conditions, but may be oxidized to sulphate in 
the air. Therefore, it is found that the sulphur in GBFS existed mostly as sulphides 
with a minor amount as sulphate. In contrast, a slowly cooled blast furnace slag had 
most of the sulphide transformed to sulphate (Roy 2009).
In the ironmaking plants, most of the molten blast furnace slag is granulated by 
water, with the generation of large amount of steam, as shown in Fig. 7.1. The prod-
uct GBFS is a valuable material for cement production. However, due to reactions 
between sulphur and water or steam, the quenching process gives rise to the genera-
tion of H2S and SO2, which are a cause of corrosion, worker exposure problems and 
odour complaints (Schmidt et al. 2003).
7.2.2  Emission
The blast furnace slag has a sulphur content of about 1–2 %, depending on raw 
material conditions. When the molten slag gets in contact with water or steam, gas-
eous sulphur compounds (H2S and SO2) will be generated according to the follow-
ing possible reactions:

These reactions mainly occur at temperatures above 1100 °C. Below 1000 °C 
only a small amount of gaseous sulphur compounds are generated (Schmidt et al. 
2003).

7  Dangerous Emissions in Blast Furnace Operations

128
Several measurements on the concentrations of H2S and SO2 emissions had been 
performed in laboratory or industrial works (Jablin 1972; Rehmus et  al. 1973; 
Annamraju et al. 1984; Mishin et al. 1987; Schmidt et al. 2003; Remus et al. 2013). 
However, these measurements vary significantly depending on processing methods, 
slag flow rate and sample locations. Nevertheless, it is found that the sulphur loss in 
slag during granulation is from 15 to 20 % regardless of the physical-chemical vari-
ations of slags (Schmidt et al. 2003). The emission factors of H2S and SO2 are 
14–300 and 13–142 g/t hot metal, respectively, in the EU (Remus et al. 2013).
Sulphur emissions are also found in the combustion of sulphur containing by-­
product gases, including BFG and coke oven gas (COG). The H2S concentration is 
about 14 mg/Nm3 for treated BFG and 50–500 mg/Nm3 for desulphurized COG 
(Remus et al. 2013). In hot stove operations, the mixed BFG and COG are widely 
used as fuel. The sulphur compounds in the gases are emitted as SO2 after firing. 
Emission concentrations for SO2 are in the range of 4–154 mg/Nm3 depending on 
the used gas, which corresponds to 1.6–154 g/t hot metal. In case of a mixture of 
BFG and non-desulphurized COG, the emission factor can be up to 400 g SO2/t hot 
metal, which corresponds to up to the concentration of 267–1000 mg/Nm3 (Remus 
et al. 2013).
7.2.3  Abatement
Because of the facts that sulphur emissions are always generated in the molten slag 
processing sites and H2S can be detected by human nose in extremely low quanti-
ties, methods have been long investigated to abate the emissions. Generally, the 
emissions of H2S and SO2 have been found depending on the following issues:
	1.	 Slag temperature
The generations of H2S and SO2 can be greatly hindered at a low processing 
temperature based on a kinetic point of view. In a slag pit cooling investigation, 
it is shown that the reduction of H2S emission is highly effective by lowering the 
slag temperature (Rehmus et al. 1973). For granulation processes, however, it is 
not easy to control the slag temperature, because lowering the temperature will 
result a rapid increase in viscosity (Gan and Lai 2014).
	2.	 Physical-chemical properties of slag
The physical-chemical properties of slag, like compositions and viscosity, 
surely have effects on H2S and SO2 emissions. Nevertheless, it is revealed that 
within the industrially acceptable range of physical-chemical variables, their 
effects on sulphur emissions are substantially constant (Schmidt et al. 2003). It 
is indicated that the H2S and SO2 emissions can hardly be influenced by varia-
tions of slag properties.
	3.	 Temperature of granulation water
The solubilities of H2S and SO2 decrease with rising water temperature. At 
cold water granulation systems, low gaseous sulphur compound emissions are 
L. Gan and H. Zhang

129
observed than at hot water systems (Schmidt et al. 2003). As far as granulation 
itself is concerned, the technique optimization should be that of controlling the 
temperature of the granulation water. Similarly, maintaining the right ratio 
between slag rate and water rate also helps reduce emissions (Société Belge de 
Filtration 1995).
	4.	 Alkalization of granulation water
The sulphur emissions tend to create acid compounds in the granulation water, 
which can be neutralized by alkali compounds. In a comparative analysis of 
industrial scale data, it is found the sulphur emissions can be cut by more than 
80 % by the use of granulation water previously alkalized with lime to pH 11–12.5 
(Mishin et al. 1987).
	5.	 Oxidation of slag and granulation water
The early laboratory studies show that the relative concentrations of H2S and 
SO2 are sensitive to the redox conditions of molten slag and atmosphere. Increase 
of partial pressure of O2 produces a very great inhibiting effect on H2S emission 
(Stoehr and Pezze 1975), whereas additions to slag of oxide agent like iron or 
manganese oxides greatly accelerate the rate of evolution of SO2 (Pelton et al. 
1974). Oxidization of molten slag by Fe2O3 or KMnO4 and oxidization granula-
tion water by KMnO4 or H2O2 have been found effective in sulphur emission 
reduction (Schmidt et al. 2003; Rehmus et al. 1973).
	6.	 End-of-line treatment
The above-mentioned methods do make a significant reduction of sulphur 
emissions. However, they constitute only a partial solution. The end-of-line treat-
ments are those treatments on exhaust air. It is needed for substantial reduction 
of sulphur emissions. Extensive operational measurements have been performed 
at laboratory trials and an industrial INBA slag granulation plants and show that 
NaOH, ferric EDTA, soda and hypochlorite scrubbings are good choices for H2S 
absorption (Schmidt et al. 2003; Société Belge de Filtration 1995).
The demonstrated sulphur emission reduction effects of various methods are pre-
sented in Table 7.1.
7.3  NOx Emissions
7.3.1  Source
There are three fundamentally different mechanisms of NOx formation, which 
yield thermal NOx, fuel NOx and prompt NO (U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency 1994, 1999). The thermal NOx mechanism arises from the thermal dis-
sociation and subsequent reaction of N2 and O2 molecules in combustion air. The 
fuel NO mechanism arises from the evolution and reaction of fuel-bound nitrogen 
compounds with oxygen. The prompt NO mechanism involves the intermediate 
formation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), followed by the oxidation of HCN to NO.
7  Dangerous Emissions in Blast Furnace Operations

130
Both blast furnace smelting and hot stoves are operated at high temperatures, i.e. 
higher than 1200 °C. As a result, the NOx generation tends to be thermal NO. The 
atmosphere in blast furnace smelting is reductive, which is thermodynamically 
unfavourable for the formation of NOx. Therefore, the hot stoves are the main 
source of emissions of NOx in the blast furnace operations.
7.3.2  Emission
The blast furnace smelting is a closed process that does not have atmospheric 
emissions. However, the associated blast furnace hot stoves do generate NOx 
emission. It is shown that NOx in the hot stoves mainly exist in the form of 
NO.  However, when gas temperature decreases, NO will be converted to NO2 
(Chen et al. 2014).
Because the stoves are heated primarily with low heat value BFG, the flame tem-
perature is reduced. NOx concentrations from the stoves tend to be low. The emis-
sion factor is 373 mg/Nm3 for the burning of BFG and 1296 mg/Nm3 for COG 
(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1994). However, since the volume of BFG 
is huge, total NOx mass emissions are still large.
Currently relatively little NOx emission data are available relevant to hot stoves. 
The stove NOx emission in US steelworks is reported in the range of 1.4–32.6 ppm, 
with an average of about 30 ppm (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1994).

The data vary widely as the test conditions were seldom specified. In Europe, 
­emission concentrations are in the range of 19–115 mg/Nm3, which corresponds to 
6–173 g/t hot metal produced (Remus et al. 2013).
7.3.3  Abatement

where k is the rate constant, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. 
Because of the high activation energy, these reactions are temperature sensitive. 
In fact, it reflects strong and exponential relationship between NOx emission 
and temperature (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1994). Therefore, the 
most effective measure to reduce thermal NOx formation is to lower the peak 
temperature.
It is suggested that the hot stove dome temperature should be controlled below 
1420 °C in order to decrease NOx emission. Increasing excess air ratio is also ben-
eficial to the reduction of NOx emission as it decreases the dome temperature (Chen 
et al. 2014).
7.4  Heavy Metal Emissions
7.4.1  Source
Blast furnace smelting typically uses high-grade ores with metal Fe content higher 
than 60 %. However, the low-grade ores with higher impurity content are becoming 
economical because of the depleting of high-grade ores. Dangerous heavy metals, 
i.e. Zn and Pb, can be found in most of the iron ores around the world. Also, dust 
and sludge are recycled as raw materials for sintering. These by-products always 
have high content of Zn. It significantly increases the Zn burden of the blast furnace. 
Heavy metals like Zn and Pb easily volatilize and deposit on different parts of the 
blast furnace during smelting. It may lead to severe environmental pollutions if not 
properly treated.
The zinc charged into the blast furnace is limited to 150–200 g/t hot metal in 
Japan (Ichikawa and Morishige 2002). The total zinc in the charge generally varies 
7  Dangerous Emissions in Blast Furnace Operations

132
from 100 to 250 g/t of hot metal produced in the EU (Remus et al. 2013). The value 
is averagely higher in China, which can reach even higher than 1500 g/t hot metal 
occasionally (Zheng et al. 2014).
7.4.2  Emission
Under the high temperature in the blast furnace, the Zn and Pb are easily 
removed with the BFG as fine ZnO and PbO particles. However, only 20–50 % 
of the total zinc in the charge are removed by the BFG (Zhou et  al. 2010; 
Zheng et al. 2014). Most of the rest becomes scaffolding on the furnace line. 
The emission of zinc from the blast furnace is then estimated to be 20–125 g/t 
hot metal.
BFG treatment usually consists of pretreatment for the removal of coarse dust 
and subsequently wet scrubbing or electrostatic precipitation for the removal of fine 
dust (and thus heavy metals). Dust is removed with a high degree of efficiency dur-
ing the two-stage treatment of BFG. The Zn and Pb concentrations are within 0.03–
0.17 mg/Nm3 and 0.01–0.05 mg/Nm3, respectively, for cleaned BFG (Remus et al. 
2013). Therefore, most of the heavy metals are then accumulated in the sludge or 
dust, depending on the use of wet or dry cleaning method in the second stage of 
BFG treatment. Typical compositions of sludge and dust from BFG treatment are 
listed in Table 7.2. The high contents of Zn and Pb make them difficult to be recy-
cled in the steel plants.

7.4.3  Abatement
Due to the high contents of Zn and Pb in the blast furnace sludge and dust, their 
recycling in the steel plant is limited. An alternative treatment, although very expen-
sive, is to dewater the sludge and deposit it on a landfill for industrial waste after 
pretreatment (Van Herck et al. 2000). However, the present environmental policies 
encourage recycling and recovery for natural resource conservation, at the same 
time avoiding the very high landfilling cost.
Both hydro- and pyrometallurgical processes can be used to recover valuable 
metals in the sludge and dust. A brief summary of related methods is presented in 
Table 7.3. In order to recover zinc, the hydrometallurgical processes have been con-
sidered more eco-friendly and produce residues suitable for safe disposal, as zinc 
could be selectively dissolved in suitable lixiviants leaving other impurities in the 
residue (Jha et al. 2001). However, since the sludge and dust also have a high con-
tent of Fe, pyrometallurgical processes have been widely used to recover both Fe 
and Zn. The rotary hearth furnace process for separating Zn and recovering Fe from 
the sludge and dust has been commercially available (Xu et al. 2012). Figure 7.2 
shows the main installations of a rotary hearth furnace in Shandong Province, China.

7.5  Fluoride Emissions
7.5.1  Source
Fluorine is typically a minor element in iron ores with concentration lower than 
0.1 %. However, for some special deposit like iron ore in Bayan Obo region in 
Baotou, China, its concentration can reach up to 4 % historically. The fluorine con-
centration of commercial Bayan Obo iron ore concentrate was still higher than 0.5 % 
in 2000 after years of relentless efforts on beneficiation (Pei 2002; Li and Yu 1990). 
In addition, fluorspar (CaF2) is sometimes used as flux in the blast furnace to opti-
mize smelting process. The fluoride emission is a serious environmental problem for 
smelting with high fluorine iron ores and flux in the blast furnace (Hu et al. 1982).
7.5.2  Emission
The fluorine in iron ores is mainly in the form of CaF2. In the blast furnace, the 
temperature increases with descending of iron ores. Under high temperature, gas-
eous fluorides of HF, KF, and NaF are formed according to the following possible 
reactions (Zhang et al. 2015; Zhu and Zhou 1994):

The newly formed CaF2 is easily blown out of the furnace as dust by the high-­speed 
off-gas. Experimental and small practical blast furnace investigations indicate that 
78–96 % of the fluorine is absorbed by slag, 3.8–14.3 % is blown out as dust mainly in 
the form of CaF2 and 0.05–8.55 % enters into the BFG mainly in the form of HF 
(Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics Academia Sinica 1959; Chow et  al. 1958, 
1959). The fluorine concentration in BFG for smelting of iron ores with 3 % fluorine 
in an experimental blast furnace is 3–13 mg/Nm3 (Chow et al. 1959) and 2.2–57.7 mg/
Nm3 in a small practical furnace (Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics Academia 
Sinica 1959).
Uncontrolled fluorine emissions are also found in the cast house of the blast 
furnace. For a 100 m3 practical blast furnace, the uncontrolled emission is found to 
be 1.29 % of the total fluorine input (Zhu and Zhou 1994).
7.5.3  Abatement
The primary method for fluorine emission abatement in the blast furnace is the 
reduction of fluorine input. The fluorine content in the iron ore concentrate should 
be restricted below 0.5 %. Removal of fluorine from sintering process rather than 
the blast furnace is a better choice from a technical point of view, because flue gas 
processing system is fully installed in most of the sintering plants.
The CaF2 in the slag may react with water during granulation to form 
HF.  The CaF2 containing slag may also cause soil and water pollutions. 
However, investigations on emission and treatment of fluorine containing blast 
furnace slag have been seldom reported. The fluorine emissions from the BFG, 
both CaF2 in the dust and HF in the gas, are mainly treated by either wet or dry 
dedusting processes. For newly built blast furnace, the flue gas treatment sys-
tem is also installed in the cast house to reduce uncontrolled fluorine emissions 
(Song and Du 2008).
7  Dangerous Emissions in Blast Furnace Operations

7.6  Conclusions
Gaseous sulphur (H2S and SO2), NOx, heavy metal (Zn, Pb) and fluorides are the 
primary dangerous emissions in blast furnace operations. The available emission 
factors are visually shown in Fig. 7.3. The emissions from the blast furnace are 
generally in low concentrations and depend strongly on operation conditions, which 
lead to difficulties in the application of abatement technologies. Since the produc-
tion of the blast furnace is huge, the mass of these emissions are appreciable. The 
heavy metal emissions from the sludge and dust are further processed and recycled. 
However, few processes have been installed to treat emissions of H2S, SO2, NOx 
and fluorine from the blast furnace.

Mathematical Simulation of Blast Furnace 
Operation
Jursová Simona, Pustějovská Pavlína, Brožová Silvie, and Bilík Jiří
Abstract  This chapter deals with possibilities of mathematical modeling of blast 
furnace operation. This chapter summarizes various attitudes for evaluation of blast 
furnace operation. The chapter is aimed at modeling of kinetics of reduction pro-
cesses. It presents a methodology developed at VŠB—Technical University of 
Ostrava—for interpreting of laboratory tests carried out according to international 
standards such as ISO 4695:2007. The designed model uses laboratory test results 
as inputs for mathematical simulation of the material processing in blast furnace 
aggregate. The model calculates kinetic constants of changes in iron oxides concen-
tration during nondirect reduction and estimates coke consumption for it. It presents 
simulation of reduction gas consumption regarding the ratio of direct reduction in 
time. It carries out simulation for one-component and two-component blast furnace 
feedstock to find easily the optimum of production process.
8.1  Introduction
Centre ENET goes on with the development of mathematical model using Rist’s 
diagram and former knowledge for simulation of reduction process in blast furnace 
(Bilík 1990). Reduction model was developed in three stages (from Fe3O4 to Fe2O3, 
then to FeO, and finally to Fe). In equations, it was required to use kinetic constants 
of single chemical reactions. Edge and initial conditions of partial differential equa-
tions were determined by two exercises (Pustejovska et al. 2013, 2015).

The first exercise was reduction on rigid bed with a great surplus of reduction 
gas, which is enabled by experimental laboratory equipment. Solution of equations 
is analytic, in the form of formula where there was amount of sample mass loss on 
the left side and on the right side there was a complicated expression depending on 
the sample initial composition and kinetic constants, which cannot be found in any 
textbook or technical literature. Experimental data (sample mass loss in time) are 
possible to use to reveal a theoretic function such values of kinetic constants for 
which theoretic time flow and time of mass loss measured during the test is almost 
the same. These quasi(kinetic) constants of ore gas reduction gained from experi-
mental data are fundamentally new partial result of the methodology.
The second exercise was reduction simulation in countercurrent in the blast fur-
nace stack. The information about chemical composition and kinetic constants of 
chemical reactions found out from the first exercise are input data using for the 
calculation. Calculation result is “practically reachable” coke minimum specific 
consumption (ω). Classical heat balance needs reducing gas composition on the 
furnace top to check coke-specific consumption at blast furnace. To calculate “theo-
retic minimum” coke consumption, it is necessary to assume reaching chemical 
equilibrium between gas and charge, which can originate only after infinite time of 
charge holding at blast furnace. Presented use of kinetic constants enables calcula-
tion of coke consumption for actual charge under current conditions of present blast 
furnace (Jursová and Bilík 2013).
8.2  Kinetic Model of Reduction
8.2.1  Simulation of Reduction in the Fixed Bed
The laboratory tests of the blast furnace burden reducibility are carried out in a sta-
tionary fixed bed. The height of the burden bed is made small, and at the same time, 
the amount of reduction gas is large. Consequently, the change of the molar O/Fe 
ratio in the burden and the molar O/C ratio in the gas along the coordinate of the 
fixed bed is small, and the derivatives with respect to the coordinate can be dropped.

where Ci is Fe concentration in the ith form as the fraction of the entire amount of 
Fe in the charge, Ki is kinetic constant (s−1), X is molar O/Fe ratio in the burden, and 
Xe,i is equilibrium molar fraction of CO with Fe in the ith form. The model yields a 
system of ordinary linear differential equations with initial determined by the values 
of the concentrations of Fe in the form i. The model can be solved analytically

The composition of the reduced burden is given by its content of Fe2O3 and 
FeO. In calculating the initial values of the concentration Ci, it is assumed that the 
sample does not contain elementary iron (C4 = 0) and that iron is combined only in 
the form of Fe3O4 (C3 = 0). e equilibrium constants were taken from the literature. 
The weighted sum of the concentrations C1, C2, and C3 gives the molar O/Fe ratio in 
the sample of the burden. Of course, in order to calculate the time dependence Y(t) in 
the analytical form, it is necessary to determine the kinetic constants K1, K2, and K3. 
These can be determined using the least squares method from the experimentally 
recorded time history of the mass loss of the oxygen in the sample during reduction 
and fitting them to the mass loss calculated from the analytical form of Y(t). The dif-
ference between calculated Y(t) and the experimental value Yj forms the objective 
function (8.6)

The objective function depends nonlinearly on the sought parameters, and it is 
therefore difficult to determine the global minimum. The optimization was therefore 
repeated for various initial estimation of the parameters K1, K2, and K3 to locate 
global minimum. The kinetic constants for the given temperature of reduction char-
acterize the reducibility in greater detail in comparison with the characteristics such 
as the amount of oxygen reduced in 1 h. To calculate the kinetic constants, it is 
necessary to have data describing the chemical equilibrium between the oxides of 
iron and between the composition of the reducing gas and the burden (Mihok and 
Baricová 2008).
Model simulation of reduction in countercurrent flow results from Rist’s dia-
gram. The slope of operating line in Rist’s diagram (Fig. 8.1) represents the specific 
consumption of the reduction gas determined by the number of kmoles of CO per 
kg of Fe in the countercurrent phases (Konstanciak et al. 2003). Calculation of the

position of the operating line is repeated for several values of the specific consumption 
of the reduction gas CS. This yields a set of operating lines whose positions are 
expressed by approximation Eq. (8.7). The parameter has been used for evaluation 
of the reducibility of the burden in the blast furnace by calculating this parameter 
from the O/Fe of the burden reduced in the direct way (rd) and the composition of 
the burden, the gas at the top of the reduction zone (XL, YL). The value of parameter 
determined from the laboratory tests of the ore reducibility can be compared  
with the value of the parameter determined from the operating data of the blast fur-
nace. Better reducibility of the ore burden is characterized by the low value of the 
parameter ω.

8.2.2  Calculation of Specific Carbon Consumption
The specific consumption of the reducing gas is identical with the specific con-
sumption of the carbon required to produce this gas (Babich et al. 2008). For the 
modeling, the calculation is carried out by Rist’s diagram. Therefore, the set of the

operating straight lines for the given ore burden specifies the relationship between 
the specific consumption of the reducing gas and the degree of the direct reduction 
depending on the value of the parameter ω. The holding reaction time can be deter-
mined from a blast furnace production rate and volume. The production rate results 
also for the intensity of heat transfer in the lower and upper zone of the blast fur-
nace. The heat balance equation of the lower zone for 1 kg of it is as follows:

The quantity Yf designates the consumption of carbon for reduction of accompa-
nying elements. The left-hand side represents the heat released by imperfect com-
bustion of carbon in front of the tuyeres and the sensible heat of the hot blast 
transferred to the burden by cooling to the temperature of the thermally ineffective 
zone. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (8.8) is the consumption of the heat 
for direct reduction, and the second term is the heat for reduction of accompanying 
elements, melting and heating the products of the melt to the tapping temperature 
and to cover heat losses. The thermal balance equation makes/enables us to write 
the equation of the operating line in the following form (8.9):

As it is shown in Fig. 8.7, the position of the point P is determined by parameters 
controlled by composition of the burden and hot metal, blast temperature, the tem-
perature of the isothermal zone, and slag and the heat losses. This indicates that the 
main problem of calculating the specific consumption of carbon is the construction 
of the operating line which passes through the point P and is also included in the set 
of the straight lines for the specific burden. The calculation results in the theoreti-
cally minimum consumption of carbon for production of hot metal which is dis-
cussed in literature as the ideal blast furnace operation in case that operating line 
passes through the point W, the calculation results in the theoretically minimum 
consumption of carbon for production of hot metal which is discussed in literature 
as the ideal blast furnace operation. The positive value of the parameter ω intro-
duces into the calculation of the specific consumption CS the dependence on the 
reducibility of the ore burden. The result of calculation may be considered as the 
prediction of the consumption of carbon for a given ore burden in the blast. The 
calculation procedures also take into account the presence of hydrogen in the reduc-
tion gas and decomposition of carbonates.

8.3  Practical Modeling of Results of Reducibility Test
Parameters of measurement are indicated in Table 8.1. The Levenberg-Marquardt 
method was used for optimization of function F(k1,k2,k3) = Σ(Yj − Y(tj))2. Optimization 
was programmed using MATLAB mathematical library. Calculated kinetic con-
stants are an important starting parameter during simulation of reduction processes 
of iron oxides in the stack of blast furnace. Calcualted kinetic constants are an 
important starting parameter during simulation of reduction processes of iron oxides 
in the stack of blast furnace (Bilík and Vu 2000). For practical modeling were used 
the samples of the properties presented in Table 8.2.
8.3.1  Example of Calculation of Reduction Run in the Area 
of Indirect Reduction
Results of reducibility test were used for simulation of different model options of 
indirect reduction of iron oxides (Pustějovská and Jursová 2013a, b). Proportion of 
direct/indirect reduction ideally represents proportion of wüstite in reduced charge 
when area-relative height of indirect reduction is zero. Below it, Boudouard’s reac-
tion already starts.
Figures 8.2 and 8.3 present reduction run of sinter of grain size amounting to 
10–12.5 mm with time period of charge keeping in reaction space of duration of 3 h 
and with reducing gas-specific consumption amounting to 2 kmol−1 of Fe.
Figure 8.4 presents reduction of two-component charge with different composi-
tions: Two sinters were selected (sinter 1, 10–12.5 mm, and sinter 2, 10–12.5 mm). 
Dependence of controlled quantities (composition of reducing gas, concentration of 
iron oxides) is graphically represented. This calculation can serve in providing opti-
mum charge composition for given technological conditions.
Mutual dependence among carbon consumption, direct reduction level, and pro-
cess intensity following kinetic model application has generally tridimensional 
form. It is obvious that the lowest coke consumption is in the optimal rate between

direct and nondirect reduction. A different ratio results in an increase of coke 
­consumption. The model interpretation has to respect the real dynamics of blast 
furnace technology. The productivity of blast furnace aggregate is affected by 
­feedstock descent. The rate affects on the time of feedstock stay in the area of non-
direct reduction. The shorter time results in the increase in ratio of direct reduction 
and the increase of heat demand relating to coke consumption (Jursová et al. 2015). 
An optimizing area for the specific consumption of reduction gas, relating to the 
time of stay in nondirect reduction area and direct reduction rate, is depicted Fig. 8.5. 
In case of usage of sinter 1, the optimizing area for the specific consumption of 
reduction relating to the time is typical with lower ratio of direct reduction, and for 
­optimized blast furnace, feedstock processing in the zone of nondirect reduction 
rate is required shorter time. The comparison is obvious from Fig. 8.6.
Figures 8.6 and 8.7 present the time effect of feedstock stay in the area of nondi-
rect reduction. It presents the changes in limit kinetic curves of carbon consumption 
at time of feedstock stay in the area of nondirect reduction. As the time is shorter, 
the limit kinetic curve of carbon consumption is of higher values.

By gaining kinetically well-founded dependence between reducing gas-specific con-
sumption and level of direct reduction, it can be then determined chemical-­kinetic 
limit of carbon consumption on indirect reduction of iron oxides expressed by the 
curve showed on Fig. 8.8. From the point of view of enthalpy balance, it is also neces-
sary to provide that heat developed during carbon gasification to reducing gas will

cover also necessary heat needs of the process. Carbon needed for heat (heat limit) 
also depends significantly on the level of direct reduction. As indirect reduction is 
applied in the first phase of blast-furnace smelting, its run extent is in principle deci-
sive for resulting mutual ratio of both reduction types (Jursová et al. 2013). Therefore 
the key role falls on kinetic simulation of indirect reduction run of iron oxides. Output 
of this simulation is a share of direct reduction on complete reduction extent—level of 
direct reduction rd. Mutual dependence between direct reduction share and resulting 
consumption of fuel carbon/deoxidizing agent represents a requirement on real mini-
mum provision of reduction process by this fuel/deoxidizing agent.

shows not only theoretic but rather real limits of minimum specific consumption of 
reducing gas respecting actual charge reducibility and which can be reached only 
through better use of reducing gas (Bilík et al. 2013).
Mathematic model based on the indirect reduction describes well the reduction 
course in the area of the blast furnace where speed of Boudouard’s reaction is small. 
But this model can also be successfully applied at simulation of reduction process 
of the so-called direct iron production where coke is not used or for estimation of 
proportion of direct/indirect reduction during processes of melting reduction.

8.4  Conclusion
The mathematical model of indirect reduction describes well the reduction in the 
zone of blast furnace where the effect of the Boudouard reaction is insignificant. But 
this model might be also successfully employed for simulation of the reduction 
process of the so-called direct reduction iron (DRI) where coke is not a part of the 
burden. First of all, the degree of the charge metallization reached at the outlet of the 
charge from the bottom part of such a countercurrent reactor is important for

The calculation of concentration profiles using mathematical modeling can be car-
ried out for different specific consumptions of the reduction gas in this countercur-
rent reactor. The simulation then enables a prediction of the degree of metallization 
­(pre-­reduction) for various alternatives of ore charges (ore, pellets, sinters).
A simulation study of the reduction using kinetic model enables us to determine 
the limits posed by the thermal conditions and the kinetics of the reduction. It also 
enables more objective assessment of the impact of the considered innovations in 
the pig iron production.

CO2 Emission Reduction in Blast Furnaces
Pasquale Cavaliere and Alessio Silvello
Abstract  Blast furnace (BF) represents the dominant hot metal-making process all 
over the world and one of the main energy-consuming processes. Modern research 
in the field focuses on the increase in plant productivity through energy saving and 
on the greenhouse emission reduction compatible with legal limits. The iron and 
steel industry is one of the biggest industrial emitters of CO2. It is estimated that 
between 4 and 7 % of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions originate from this industry 
in EU-27, which generated 252.5 million tons of CO2 emissions on average during 
the period 2005–2008. Productivity is mainly governed by relevant input parame-
ters such as material rates, material properties, and operating conditions. All the 
dominant input parameters and their variation have been analyzed in the present 
study, and they have been optimized in order to increase the plant productivity and 
reduce the greenhouse emissions. The study suggests new solutions in all process-
ing parameters in order to improve plant productivity and to reduce the dangerous 
emissions.
9.1  Introduction
Blast furnace (BF) represents the dominant hot metal-making process all over the 
world and one of the main energy-consuming processes. Modern iron-making pro-
cess development largely focuses on saving materials and energy, as well as on 
reducing environmental impact.
Nowadays, the most dominant hot metal-making process in the world is still the 
BF process, and modern research in the field focuses on the increase in plant pro-
ductivity through energy saving and on the greenhouse emission reduction compatible

with legal limits. BF represents the main energy consumption operation in 
­steelmaking industry; the increase in blast furnace productivity leads to a strong 
reduction in energy consumption.
The challenge, therefore, is to improve the technologies that will bring reduced 
consumption of energy, reduced consumption of raw materials, and reduced levels of 
emissions besides being cost effective. Steel being one of the major energy consum-
ers in the manufacturing sector, major intervention will be required in this aspect.
The International Iron and Steel Institute identified 11 sustainable indicators in 
January, 2005, based on the information from 42 steel companies representing over 
33 % of the world’s crude steel production. The 11 sustainable indicators are:
	 1.	 Greenhouse gas emission
	 2.	 Energy intensity
	 3.	 Steel recycling
	 4.	 Environmental management system (EMS)
	 5.	 Investment in processes and products
	 6.	 Operating margin
	 7.	 Return on capital employed (ROCE)
	 8.	 Value added
	 9.	 Material efficiency
	10.	 Employee training
	11.	 Lost time injury frequency rate
The industries’ environmental performance is measured by the indicators from nos. 
1 to 4, the economic performance is measured by the indicators from nos. 5 to 9, and the 
social performance is measured by two indicators, i.e., nos. 10 and 11. On sustainable 
development, it is essential that the steel industry needs a systematic method to measure 
and report how the industries are performing with regard to the above 11 indicators.
The modern steelmakers continued to use the same carbothermic process dis-
covered by the first iron-makers. The BF is a countercurrent continuous reactor 
occurring between the descending mix of iron ores, coke, and limestone and an 
ascending hot blast air. The objective of BF is to reduce iron oxides into iron 
metal within desirable specifications. High production capacity and very high 
employment have kept it the primary pig iron production. The most important raw 
material fed into the BF, in terms of operation efficiency and hot metal quality, is 
coke. Coke is produced by heating a coal blend in the absence of oxygen. The 
most common type of production technique is the so-called conventional or by-
product coke plant. Coke performs three functions in a blast furnace, namely, a 
thermal function, as fuel providing the energy required for endothermic chemical 
reactions and for melting of iron and slag; a chemical function, as reductant by 
providing reducing gases for iron oxide reduction; and a mechanical function, as 
a permeable grid providing for the passage of liquids and gases in the furnace, 
particularly in the lower part of the furnace. Basically a BF is charged with alter-
nate layers of coke and iron-bearing minerals. Such iron-bearing materials are a 
mixing of sinter, pellets, and iron ore with a varying ratio depending on the fur-
nace. Different additives such as lime, dolomite, and quartz are inserted to con-
trol and regulate the slag composition, quality, and viscosity.

The main goals of recent research are decrease in coke use, increase in productivity, 
and reduction of dangerous emissions. In the last decade, three consistent themes 
have appeared pertaining to coke properties and blast furnace performance. They 
are related to the viability of the blast furnace, improvement in BF productivity and 
efficiency, and blast furnace operations at lower coke rates. The BF productivity 
depends strongly on the rate and degree of reduction; they are directly related to the 
reactivity of coke and to the composition and reducibility of the iron-bearing charge. 
In addition, it is interesting to note that if the iron bearing presents a good reduction 
strength, it is possible to reduce the coke consumption with optimal economic bal-
ance of the production process. Actually, one of the fundamental physical parame-
ters for the reduction optimization is the mean dimension of the ores, pellets, and 
sinters; in general, the rate of reduction decreases with increasing size of the raw 
materials. Complex gas–solid, solid–solid, and liquid–liquid interactions take place 
in different zones of the BF.
9.2  Blast Furnace Operations
The BF is the first step in producing steel from iron oxides. The first blast furnaces 
appeared in the fourteenth century and produced 1 t per day. BF equipment is in 
continuous evolution, and modern, giant furnaces produce 13,000 t per day. Even 
though the equipment has improved and higher production rates can be achieved, 
the processes inside the blast furnace remain the same. BF will survive into the next 
millennium because the larger, efficient furnaces can produce hot metal at costs 
competitive with other iron-making technologies.
The purpose of a BF is to chemically reduce and physically convert iron oxides 
into liquid iron called “hot metal.” The BF is a huge steel stack lined with refractory 
brick, where iron ore, coke, and limestone are dumped into the top and preheated air 
is blown from the bottom. The raw materials require 6–8 h to descend to the bottom 
of the furnace where they become the final product of liquid slag and liquid iron. 
These liquid products are drained from the furnace at regular intervals. The hot air 
blown from the bottom of the furnace ascends to the top in 6–8 s after going through 
numerous chemical reactions. Once a BF is started, it will continuously run for 4–10 
years with only short stops to perform planned maintenance.
9.2.1  Blast Furnace Processes
Iron oxides can come to the blast furnace plant in the form of raw ore, pellets, or 
sinter. The raw ore is removed from the earth and sized into pieces that range from 
0.5 to 1.5 in. This ore is either hematite (Fe2O3) or magnetite (Fe3O4), and the iron 
content ranges from 50 to 70 %. This iron-rich ore can be charged directly into a 
blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore with a lower iron content must 
9  CO2 Emission Reduction in Blast Furnaces

154
be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content. Pellets are produced from 
this lower iron content ore. This ore is crushed and ground into a powder so the 
waste material called gangue can be removed. The remaining iron-rich powder is 
rolled into balls and fired in a furnace to produce strong, marble-sized pellets that 
contain 60–65 % iron. Sinter is produced from fine raw ore, small coke, sand-sized 
limestone, and numerous other steel plant waste materials that contain some iron. 
These fine materials are proportioned to obtain a desired product chemistry and then 
mixed together. This raw material mix is then placed on a sintering strand, which is 
similar to a steel conveyor belt, where it is ignited by gas-fired furnace and fused by 
the heat from the coke fines into larger size pieces of 0.5–2.0 in. The iron ore, pel-
lets, and sinter then become the liquid iron produced in the blast furnace with any of 
their remaining impurities going to the liquid slag.
The coke is produced from a mixture of coals. The coal is crushed and ground 
into a powder and then charged into an oven. As the oven is heated, the coal is 
cooked so most of the volatile matters such as oil and tar are removed. The cooked 
coal, called coke, is removed from the oven after 18–24 h of reaction time. The coke 
is cooled and screened into pieces ranging from 1 to 4 in. The coke contains 90–93 % 
carbon, some ash, and sulfur but compared to raw coal is very strong. The strong 
pieces of coke with a high energy value provide permeability, heat, and gases which 
are required to reduce and melt the iron ore, pellets, and sinter.
The final raw material in the iron-making process is limestone. The limestone is 
extracted from the earth by blasting with explosives. It is then crushed and screened 
to a size that ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 in. to become blast furnace flux. This flux can 
be pure high calcium limestone, dolomitic limestone containing magnesia, or a mix-
ture of the two types of limestone.
Since the limestone is melted to become the slag, which removes sulfur and other 
impurities, the blast furnace operator may blend the different stones to produce the 
desired slag chemistry and create optimum slag properties such as a low melting 
point and a high fluidity.
All of the raw materials are stored in an ore field and transferred to the stock-
house before charging. Once these materials are charged into the furnace top, they 
go through numerous chemical and physical reactions while descending to the bot-
tom of the furnace.
The iron ore, pellets, and sinter are reduced, simply meaning that the oxygen in 
the iron oxides is removed by a series of chemical reactions. These reactions occur 
as follows (Table 9.1).

At the same time, the iron oxides are going through these purifying reactions; 
they are also beginning to soften, then melt, and finally trickle as liquid iron through 
the coke to the bottom of the furnace.
The coke descends to the bottom of the furnace where the preheated air or hot 
blast enters the blast furnace. The coke is ignited by this hot blast and immediately 
reacts to generate heat as follows:

Since the reaction takes place in the presence of excess carbon at a high tempera-

The product of this reaction, carbon monoxide, is necessary to reduce the iron ore 
as seen in the previous iron oxide reactions.

through its first reaction as follows:

This reaction requires energy and starts at about 1600 °F. The CaO formed from this 
reaction is used to remove sulfur from the iron, which is necessary before the hot 
metal becomes steel. This sulfur-removing reaction is

The CaS becomes part of the slag. The slag is also formed from any remaining silica 
(SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), magnesia (MgO), or calcia (CaO) that entered with the iron 
ore, pellets, sinter, or coke. The liquid slag then trickles through the coke bed to the 
bottom of the furnace where it floats on top of the liquid iron since it is less dense.
Another product of the iron-making process, in addition to molten iron and slag, 
is hot dirty gases. These gases exit the top of the blast furnace and proceed through 
gas cleaning equipment where particulate matter is removed from the gas and the 
gas is cooled. This gas has a considerable energy value so it is burned as a fuel in the 
“hot blast stoves” which are used to preheat the air entering the blast furnace to 
become “hot blast.” Any of the gas not burned in the stoves is sent to the boiler 
house and is used to generate steam, which turns on a turbo blower that generates 
the compressed air known as “cold blast” going to the stoves.
In summary, the blast furnace is a countercurrent reactor where solids descend 
and gases ascend. In this reactor, there are numerous chemical and physical reac-
tions that produce the desired final product that is hot metal. A typical hot metal 
chemistry follows (Table 9.2).
Now that we have completed a description of the iron-making process, we will 
review the physical equipment comprising the blast furnace plant.

There is an ore storage yard that can also be an ore dock where boats and barges 
are unloaded. The raw materials stored in the ore yard are raw ore, several types of 
pellets, sinter, limestone or flux blend, and possibly coke. These materials are trans-
ferred to the “stockhouse/hiline” complex by ore bridges equipped with grab buck-
ets or by conveyor belts. Materials can also be brought to the stockhouse/hiline in 
rail hoppers or transferred from ore bridges to self-propelled rail cars called “ore 
transfer cars.” Each type of ore, pellet, sinter, coke, and limestone is dumped into 
separate “storage bins.” The various raw materials are weighed according to a cer-
tain recipe designed to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. This material 
weighing is done under the storage bins by a rail-mounted scale car or computer-­
controlled weigh hoppers that feed a conveyor belt. The weighed materials are then 
dumped into a “skip” car which rides on rails up the “inclined skip bridge” to the 
“receiving hopper” at the top of the furnace. The cables lifting the skip cars are 
powered by large winches located in the “hoist” house. Some modern blast furnaces 
accomplish the same job with an automated conveyor stretching from the stock-
house to the furnace top.
At the top of the furnace, the materials are held until a “charge” usually consist-
ing of some type of metal (ore, pellets, or sinter), coke, and flux (limestone) has 
accumulated. The precise filling order is developed by the blast furnace operators to 
carefully control gas flow and chemical reactions inside the furnace. The materials 
are charged into the blast furnace through two stages of conical “bells” which seal 
in the gases and distribute the raw materials evenly around the circumference of the 
furnace “throat.” Some modern furnaces do not have bells but instead have two or 
three air lock-type hoppers that discharge raw materials onto a rotating chute which 
can change angles allowing more flexibility in precise material placement inside the 
furnace.
Also at the top of the blast furnace are four “uptakes” where the hot, dirty gas exits 
the furnace dome. The gas flows up to where two uptakes merge into an “offtake.” 
The two offtakes then merge into the “downcomer.” At the extreme top of the uptakes, 
there are “bleeder valves” which may release gas and protect the top of the furnace 
from sudden gas pressure surges. The gas descends in the downcomer to the “dust 
catcher,” where coarse particles settle out, accumulate, and are dumped into a rail-
road car or truck for disposal. The gas then flows through a “venturi scrubber” which

removes the finer particles and finally into a “gas cooler” where water sprays reduce 
the temperature of the hot but clean gas. Some modern furnaces are equipped with a 
combined scrubber and cooling unit. The cleaned and cooled gas is now ready for 
burning.
The clean gas pipeline is directed to the hot blast “stove.” There are usually three 
or four cylindrical-shaped stoves in a line adjacent to the blast furnace. The gas is 
burned at the bottom of a stove, and the heat rises and transfers to the refractory 
bricks inside the stove. The products of combustion flow through passages in these 
bricks, out of the stove into a high “stack” which is shared by all of the stoves.
Large volumes of air, from 80,000 ft3/min to 230,000 ft3/min, are generated from 
a turbo blower and flow through the “cold blast main” up to the stoves. This cold 
blast then enters the stove that has been previously heated, and the heat stored in the 
refractory brick inside the stove is transferred to the “cold blast” to form “hot blast.” 
The hot blast temperature can be from 1600 to 2300 °F depending on the stove 
design and condition. This heated air then exits the stove into the “hot blast main” 
which runs up to the furnace. There is a “mixer line” connecting the cold blast main 
to the hot blast main that is equipped with a valve used to control the blast tempera-
ture and keep it constant. The hot blast main enters into a doughnut-shaped pipe that 
encircles the furnace, called the “bustle pipe.” From the bustle pipe, the hot blast is 
directed into the furnace through nozzles called “tuyeres.” These tuyeres are equally 
spaced around the circumference of the furnace. There may be 14 tuyeres on a small 
blast furnace and 40 tuyeres on a large blast furnace. These tuyeres are made of cop-
per and are water cooled since the temperature directly in front of them may be 
3600–4200 °F. Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal, and oxygen can also be injected 
into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy, 
which is necessary to increase the productivity (Cores et al. 2007). The molten iron 
and slag drip past the tuyeres on the way to the furnace hearth, which starts imme-
diately below the tuyere level.
Around the bottom half of the blast furnace, the “casthouse” encloses the bustle 
pipe, the tuyeres, and the equipment for “casting” the liquid iron and slag. The 
opening in the furnace hearth for casting or draining the furnace is called the “iron 
notch.” A large drill mounted on a pivoting base called the “taphole drill” swings up 
to the iron notch and drills a hole through the refractory clay plug into the liquid 
iron. Another opening on the furnace called the “cinder notch” is used to draw off 
slag or iron in emergency situations. Once the taphole is drilled open, liquid iron 
and slag flow down a deep trench called a “trough.” Set across and into the trough is 
a block of refractory, called a “skimmer,” which has a small opening underneath it. 
The hot metal flows through this skimmer opening, over the “iron dam” and down 
the “iron runners.” Since the slag is less dense than iron, it floats on top of the iron 
and down the trough, hits the skimmer, and is diverted into the “slag runners.” The 
liquid slag flows into “slag pots” or into slag pits (not shown), and the liquid iron 
flows into refractory-lined “ladles” known as torpedo cars or sub-cars due to their 
shape. When the liquids in the furnace are drained down to the taphole level, some 
of the blast from the tuyeres causes the taphole to spit. This signals the end of the 
cast, so the “mud gun” is swung into the iron notch. The mud gun cylinder, which 
9  CO2 Emission Reduction in Blast Furnaces

158
was previously filled with a refractory clay, is actuated, and the cylinder ram pushes 
clay into the iron notch stopping the flow of liquids. When the cast is complete, the 
iron ladles are taken to the steel shops for processing into steel, and the slag is taken 
to the slag dump where it is processed into roadfill or railroad ballast. The casthouse 
is then cleaned and readied for the next cast, which may occur in 45 min to 2 h. 
Modern, larger blast furnaces may have as many as four tapholes and two cast-
houses. It is important to cast the furnace at the same rate that raw materials are 
charged and iron/slag produced so liquid levels can be maintained in the hearth and 
below the tuyeres. Liquid levels above the tuyeres can burn the copper casting and 
damage the furnace lining.
9.3  CO2 Emissions
Industrial processes produce about 21 % of total CO2 emissions. According to the 
IEA (International Energy Agency), the steel industry accounts for approximately 
4–5 % of the global CO2 emissions.
On average, 1.9 t of CO2 are emitted for every ton of steel produced. Therefore, 
it is vital for the steel industry to accelerate the pace of innovations undertaken to 
achieve production solutions with reduced CO2 emissions.
Steel production from complete cycle inherently needs the carbon as a reducing 
agent: the iron must be transformed from the state of oxide (Fe2O3, Fe3O4) to the 
metal (Fe). The system used for this transformation is the blast furnace. The tech-
nology of the blast furnace involves the use of 400–500 kg of carbon per ton of cast 
iron. The carbon is used for the reduction of iron oxide into metallic iron, to gener-
ate heat and as a constituent of the cast iron. At the end of the blast furnace process, 
the residual carbon (in the form of CO gas) is used in other systems in which the 
processing takes place from CO to CO2.
Therefore, in a full-cycle plant, the production of CO2 is linked to the chemical–
physical laws of the steel production process.
To be met by 2020, which is referred to as the 20-20-20 target, this means at 
least a 20 % reduction of greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels, 20 % of 
energy consumption to come from renewable resources, and a 20 % reduction in 
primary energy use compared to projected levels, to be achieved by improvements 
in energy efficiency. The iron and steel industry is one of the biggest industrial 
emitters of CO2. It is estimated that between 4 and 7 % of the anthropogenic CO2 
emissions originate from this industry in EU-27, which generated 252.5 million 
tons of CO2 emissions on average during the period 2005–2008. The ongoing 
increase in world steel demand means that this industry’s energy use and CO2 
emissions continue to grow, so there is significant incentive to develop, commer-
cialize, and adopt emerging energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction tech-
nologies for steel production. Furthermore, the iron and steel industry is the 
largest energy-consuming industry in the world, as well as the most important 
sources of CO2 emissions.

Global warming has become a matter of real concern. The people all over the 
world are focusing on innovative green technologies in different sectors. Iron and 
steelmaking is critical from the perspective of greenhouse gases. Iron and steelmak-
ing is among the largest energy consumer in the manufacturing sector, since it 
involves many energy-intensive processes that consume raw and recycled materials 
in large quantities. Raw materials with intensive carbon contents which are the pri-
mary resources for steel production influence climate changes materially. About 
half of the steel industry’s energy derives from coal, and a large portion of this is 
consumed during the reduction of iron ore to pig iron.
Since conventional steelmaking processes are highly polluting, a search for some 
less polluting technology options is necessary. It is believed that coke making, steel-
making, and hot rolling areas hold vast scope for minimizing pollution levels lead-
ing to a cleaner and greener environment.
Coke oven by-product plants with complete gas tight collector headers in the by-­
product recovery plant lead to a higher eco-friendly process. Another eco-friendly 
option is to develop new coking process that reduces emissions at the source. The 
aim should be to approach zero pollution level. Opportunities for pollution minimi-
zation include the reduction of slag volume through better control of lime input to 
the furnace and improved control of silicon and sulfur in blast furnace hot metal.
Steel companies have both challenges and opportunities to improve their man-
agement practices and respond effectively to the needs of environment protection. 
Many leaders in the steel industry, as well as in other sectors, are beginning to prac-
tice new technologies and adopt management principles that reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and minimize overall climate impact. They have, for example, launched 
voluntary emission reduction programs and are participating in emission trading 
markets. With the ushering in the Kyoto Protocol, the industry will be expected to 
calculate and manage actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to 
improvements in emission intensity levels that occur normally over time. Purchasing 
and producing renewable energy, investing in low-carbon technologies, working to 
improve energy efficiency, and offering new products and services aimed at reduc-
ing emissions are all meaningful strategies for the steel industry to undertake. It is 
important to monitor the sustainability indicators for their mining as also iron and 
steelmaking so that both current and future generations will stand to derive eco-
nomic advantages.
The challenge, therefore, is to improve the technologies that will bring reduced 
consumption of energy, reduced consumption of raw materials, and reduced levels 
of emissions besides being cost effective. Steel being one of the major energy con-
sumers in the manufacturing sector, major intervention will be required in this 
aspect. So, a road map for achieving energy efficiency and energy conservation will 
be required.
The transition to a clean, green world will transform our whole economy. It will 
change our industrial landscape, our supply chain, and the way in which we all 
work and consume. Although the shift to a clean, green economy is an environ-
mental and economic imperative, it is also an economic opportunity. Businesses 
and consumers can benefit from significant savings through energy and resource 
9  CO2 Emission Reduction in Blast Furnaces

160
efficiency ­measures. Supplying the demands of the clean, green economy offers a 
significant potential contribution to economic growth and job creation. The transi-
tion to a clean, green economy is necessary for two reasons. Primarily it is to sta-
bilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Secondly, the clean, green 
path is seen as a viable stimulus for a tipping economy. But it is also important to 
acknowledge that the “limits to growth” thesis has been confirmed after decades of 
poor criticism. The way forward to a sustainable future is to master and widely 
deploy clean engineering technologies.
For business, the transition to clean and green economy offers both commercial 
opportunities and the chance to save money and release productive resources 
through greater energy efficiency. At the heart of the clean, green industrial strategy 
are drivers of fundamental change in four key areas:
•	 Energy efficiency to save businesses, consumers, and the public service money
•	 Putting in place the energy infrastructure for the world’s clean, green future in 
renewables, nuclear, carbon capture, and storage
•	 Development and production, for example, of clean, green technologies
•	 Ensuring skills, infrastructure, procurement, research and development, demon-
stration, and deployment policies to locate and develop a clean, green business 
and make sure international business recognizes that
So, the global shift to a clean, green economy could help to drive renewed growth 
that will lift us out of the economic downturn. It will be key in the long-term indus-
trial future.
9.4  Experimental Procedure
Many of the blast furnace quality and performance indices are strictly dependent on 
sinter plant ones, and the quality and properties of raw materials must be analyzed 
before each blast furnace production cycle. The data can be collected from a plant 
in a definite period, and the working and useful volumes of the blast furnace are 
specified. The productivity data can be calculated referring to the working volume. 
Pellets, limestone, and coke compositional and quality ranges must be analyzed at 
each cycle, and the data must be reported. The material charges can be constantly 
monitored through the flux analysis of parallel bunkers at the top of the blast fur-
nace. Then, the main independent variables can be underlined; the weight of such 
parameters on productivity and CO2 emissions must be analyzed. The composition 
of the flue gases can be monitored according to EN-1948 parts 2 and 3, EN-1948SS 
(sampling standards, Wellington Laboratories), EN-1948ES (extraction standards, 
Wellington Laboratories), and EN-1948IS (injection standards, Wellington 
Laboratories), by employing a high-resolution gas chromatograph and a high-­
resolution selective mass detector, such as gas chromatograph “PCF Elettronica” 
and mass detector “Exactive,” visible in Figs. 9.1 and 9.2.
P. Cavaliere and A. Silvello

161
The automatic gas chromatograph can perform continuous analysis of a wide 
range of volatile organic compounds. It is based on the technique of the gas chro-
matographic separation and uses a flame ionization detection (FID). A pump down-
stream of the system fills a capillary which, brought to atmospheric pressure to 
obtain repeatable sampled volumes, is introduced via a rotary ten-way valve, in a 
gas chromatographic column for the separation of other organic substances of inter-
est. The values obtained are integrated with a calculation software, by providing 
concentration by volume (ppmv) or weight (mg/m3) (Table 9.3).
The aim of this paper is the research of an “optimum” condition in the develop-
ment of the metallurgical BF process. The main goal is to analyze and optimize the 
emission of CO2 and productivity in the BF after optimizing, for example, the emis-
sions of PCDD/F, SOx, and NOx and productivity of a sintering plant.

9  CO2 Emission Reduction in Blast Furnaces

162
To do this, all the data must be collected in a broad period and can be analyzed 
by employing a multi-objective optimization tool, such as “modeFRONTIER” 
(ESTECO).
modeFRONTIER is an open system for the multi-objective and multidisciplinary 
optimization, based on the use of the Pareto limit frontier in space of the goals built 
on the industry needs. The system allows, for example, a multipurpose optimization 
(for problems with continuous, discrete, or mixed variables and variables compared 
to the limits/conditions that may develop during the process) or to formalize and 
manage a workflow to implement processes of any complexity in a flexible and 
dynamic way or to use a meta-model and the response surface methodology (RSM), 
to further reduce calculation times and increase information.
The optimization analysis can be achieved by considering the BF as a “black 
box” and applying the concept of input–output model. Thus by acquiring data from 
sensors located at the designated points of BF, various output parameters can be 
instantaneously determined and compared. Basically, an enormous number of data 
points each consisting of a setting of the critical input parameters of the blast fur-
nace and the associated productivity values can be recorded on a real-time basis.
9.5  Results and Discussion
The target of the study is the definition of the main processing parameters leading 
to an optimization of blast furnace productivity with a decrease in CO2 emissions. 
During blast furnace operations, many factors influence the behavior, and a seri-
ous selection of the independent variables affecting the productivity and the dan-
gerous emissions has been performed. High productivity operation of a blast 
furnace requires enhancing reducibility and improving reduction behavior at high 
temperatures of sintered ore. The study can be started, for example, from the 
results previously obtained with optimization of a sintering plant (Cavaliere and 
Perrone 2013). It can be performed an analysis on the sinter plant operations in 
terms of productivity vs. reduction rate for different values of productivity of the 
blast furnace.
The optimal operating conditions of the sinter machine were fixed as shown in 
Table 9.4, corresponding to the underlined points in Fig. 9.3.

Fig. 9.3  Reduction rate as a function of sinter productivity and blast furnace productivity
Starting from such results, different BF operating conditions can be analyzed in 
order to increase the productivity taking into account the control of CO2 emissions. 
In the sintering conditions described in Fig. 9.3, the different material qualities must 
be recorded, and the compositional and physical properties of the sintered material 
are indicated in Table 9.5.
The blast furnace is a reactor inside which gaseous, liquid, and solid phases 
coexist while consuming sinter, pellets, coke, and raw materials. All such phases 
influence the BF productivity through different physical–chemical, mechanical, and 
fluid processes and different endothermic and exothermic reactions, all acting 
simultaneously and affecting each others. In the blast furnace, formation of slag and 
the mineralogical transformation that the slag undergoes during the descending of 
burden inside the furnace influence the quality of hot metal. It is known that the 
components of slag, namely, silica and alumina, increase the viscosity, whereas the 
presence of calcium oxide reduces the viscosity. The melting zone of slag deter-
mines the cohesive zone of the blast furnace, and hence the fluidity and melting 
9  CO2 Emission Reduction in Blast Furnaces

164
characteristics of slag play a major role in determining the blast furnace productiv-
ity; the way how ferrous burden materials soften and melt greatly affects the fur-
nace’s performance. Initially iron-rich slag is formed, and thereafter due to 
assimilation of CaO and MgO from the flux, the composition of slag varies. As the 
slag trickles down, it assimilates silica and alumina of ash, generated from the com-
bustion of coke. The process of trickling down depends on viscosity of slag, which 
further is governed by the composition and temperature of the melt. The softening 
and melting behavior of ore is significantly affected by its rate of reduction, which 
is determined by its physical structure and chemical composition. The high levels of 
Fe and FeO coupled with the low levels of Al2O3 in the sinter guarantee further high 
levels of reducibility. Another important effect is the optimal composition in terms 
of MgO content leading to very high levels of sinter reducibility in the BF (Shen 
et al. 2006).
Many interesting papers describe the effect of raw material properties on blast 
furnace indexes (Jiang et al. 2010). This importance originates from the behavior of 
minerals during combustion. They can influence coal reactivity, and their transfor-
mations can have a detrimental impact on heat transfer process efficiency. High 
levels of basicity of the sinter allow to reduce the limestone addition, blast volume, 
and slag volume and consequently to reduce the coke consumption. An increase of 
basicity catalyzes the coke reactivity. In addition, heat loss decreases and furnace 
productivity rises. In general an increase in sinter basicity is well known to have a 
positive effect on all the quality and performance indices of the blast furnaces. In the 
last 50 years, more than 50 % of greenhouse emissions have been reduced especially 
through raw material rate and mixing optimization; anyway in normal blast fur-
naces, the consumed carbon is almost 30 % higher than the theoretical stoichiomet-
ric limit; a broad work can be made in such direction.
All the input parameters critically affecting the blast furnace indexes have been 
monitored for a long period and weighted. All the described description derives 
from long and deep analyses of the blast furnace behavior as a function of different 
input parameter variations. Coke quality is of fundamental importance in the opera-
tion of blast furnaces. Having coke that is of high quality with respect to its role as 
a reducing agent, a heat carrier, and a material which imparts good gas permeability 
to the charge is an important precondition for the stable operation of blast furnaces

(BFs). The importance of coke quality and its effect on the course of the smelting 
operation both increase with an increase in the size and capacity of the furnace. One 
of the main goals globally is to improve the coke-making process in order to prepare 
high-quality coke for low coke rate. Actually coke properties affect gas permeabil-
ity, reduction efficiency, high-temperature properties, and segregation control. The 
coke size was strictly controlled in order to prevent deterioration of permeability 
and then of productivity of the BF (Sato et al. 1984; Nakagawa et al. 1992).
The relationships between the different parameters affecting the BF productivity 
and CO2 emissions have been analyzed; actually just the parameters with heavy 
weight on such outputs were taken into account. Validation is important in order to 
determine if the model description is sufficient to solve the problems formulated. 
Both the model and model results have been validated.
Much attention must be taken in coke rate employment. In the blast furnace, the 
rate of consumption is governed by the reducibility of the ore and sinter and the 
reactivity of the coke. Coke rate and sinter rate have a strong effect on BF productiv-
ity, as shown in Fig. 9.4.
Coke rate and sinter rate have a strong effect on BF productivity. The furnace 
performance indices depend on the behavior of the coke throughout the entire vol-
ume of the furnace. It is necessary to analyze how an optimization of raw material 
utilization is compatible with the productivity of the blast furnace; one of the more 
direct ways is to couple the analysis of material flow and consequent productivity 
with the specific reducibility as a function of the variation of coke and sinter rate. 
The softening of burden materials is an extremely complex phenomenon, but the 
furnace investigations indicate that very significant productivity gains may be pos-
sible if the softening behavior of raw materials can be confined to a narrow tempera-
ture range after a high degree of reduction has been attained. In addition, a high 
reducibility of the materials is directly related to energy saving which represents a 
crucial need in the industrial practice. High productivity operation of a blast furnace 
requires enhancing reducibility and improving reduction behavior at high tempera-
tures of sintered ore. The present analysis shows that productivity increases with the 
decreasing of coke rate and by increasing the sinter rate up to a limit in which an 
inversion of the trend can be underlined. In the case of sinter rate, productivity 
increases with sinter reducibility. Such behavior is due to a decrease in reduction 
time in the BF and an increase in the indirect reduction operations (Mousa et al. 
2010). In this way it is possible to identify operating conditions coupling both a 
reduction in coke consumption and a good level of productivity in the blast furnace.
The variables which can be manipulated in a blast furnace can be divided into 
two classes, those entering the system from the top and those entering the system 
from the bottom. Between all the variables influencing productivity and emissions, 
the only ones to be considered are those with the heavier weight on such outputs; the 
manipulated variables entering from the top are the ore/coke ratio and the basicity 
ratio. The basicity ratio is related to the amount of flux material limestone and added 
per ton of hot metal produced. The manipulated variables from the bottom are the 
temperature and the fuel/ore ratio. For the efficient operation of the steelmaking 
9  CO2 Emission Reduction in Blast Furnaces

166
process, the hot metal produced in the blast furnace has to meet stringent specifica-
tions with respect to composition and temperature (Fig. 9.5).
Combustion conditions strongly affect the blast furnace productivity; the exter-
nal parameters easily tunable are represented by temperature and oxygen variation. 
Temperature and gas oxygen content strongly influences metal transformations and

consequently BF productivity. An increase in productivity on the one hand requires 
an increase in the gas throughput, which implies improvement in furnace 
­permeability, and on the other hand a reduction in the specific gas requirement, 
which finally means a reduction in the specific consumption of reducing agents. The 
blast furnace is a countercurrent reactor in which the reducing gas is produced by 
coke carbon gasification with the oxygen of the hot blast injected via tuyeres in the 
lower part of the furnace. This reducing gas flows upward reducing the iron-bearing 
materials charged at the top of the furnace. Permeability of the ferrous burden and 
coke column for the gas flow is inseparably linked together with the increase of gas 
throughput. In the recent years, oxygen enrichment has been indicated as a strong 
possible factor in reducing coke consumption in the blast furnace. Reduction of 
lower oxides can be controlled by tuning the oxygen potential. In spite of the 
­variation of the direct reduction rate, coke saving and productivity are possible 
through the optimization of oxygen tuning in the blast. In addition, it is well known 
that over 30 % of the final cost of cast iron is dependent on energy consumption in 
the blast furnace. Temperature and oxygen addition influences BF productivity as 
shown in Fig. 9.6.
The maximum increase in oxygen content is also limited by the fact that the 
­pressure of the blast air is theoretically and practically restricted. Basically CO2 
emissions depend on different parameters such as the improvement of shaft effi-
ciency, the charge of metallic materials, the heat control in the BF, and the control 
of equilibrium FeO/Fe and then oxygen balance. Actually all the main input param-
eters influence CO2 emissions, first of all coke and sinter rate (Fig. 9.7).
For further analysis coke rate/sinter rate ratio has been employed into the graphs; 
such ratio and limestone addition influences CO2 emissions (Fig. 9.8); CO2 emis-
sions decrease considerably with coke rate decrease and low levels of limestone 
addition.
Finally, it is possible to underline an important relationship between sinter rate/
coke rate ratio, CO2 emissions, and productivity (Fig. 9.9) that can be interpolated 
by a cubic spline very useful in industrial operations.
9.6  Conclusions
The effect of the changing operating parameters on the plant productivity and 
greenhouse emissions has been investigated. In the study, several efficiency 
improvements were identified as regard to coke reduction, productivity, and CO2 
emissions. Multiple regressions have been established between the main opera-
tional parameters of the blast furnace and the productivity and CO2 emissions.

Sinter and coke properties were fixed into very strict ranges belonging to previous 
studies; such previous studies have been performed by focusing on a strong reduc-
tion of dangerous emissions. As a general point of view, the precise control of all the 
main processing parameters from the sintering operations to the BF ones leads to a 
strong reduction in dangerous emissions and to good levels of plants productivity.

Recent Trends in Ironmaking Blast Furnace 
Technology to Mitigate CO2 Emissions: 
Tuyeres Injection

Abstract  Minimizing the coke consumption in the blast furnace is the key to 
achieve both ecological and economic aspects by reducing the CO2 emissions and 
the overall hot metal production cost. Complementary injection of cheaper auxiliary 
fuels and waste materials into the blast furnace via tuyeres has been greatly modi-
fied in the recent years to reduce the expensive coke consumption. Nowadays, most 
of the blast furnaces all over the world use pulverized coal at different injection 
rates. The greatest influence of coal injection on lowering the production cost and 
enhancement of hot metal production rate has led to further investigations on the 
injection of various other auxiliary materials including coke oven gas, converter 
gas, blast furnace dust, waste plastics, charcoal and torrefied biomass. In addition,

trials on the injection of iron ore fines, low reduced iron and BOF slag have been 
recently studied. The injection rate of auxiliary materials into the blast furnace 
should be optimized to attain the minimum coke consumption and stable operation. 
The present chapter will discuss the influence of various materials injection on the 
blast furnace operation. The injection limit and changing of the blast furnace operat-
ing conditions, hot metal quality and coke consumption will be explained based on 
the experimental trials and mathematical modelling.
10.1  Introduction
Iron and steel industry is one of the most important sectors which have a great 
impact on the global growth and economy. The steel production is sharply 
increased in the recent years to reach more than 1662 million tons in 2014, up by 
1.2 % compared to 2013 (World Steel Association 2014). By 2050, steel use is 
expected to be increased by 1.5 times higher than present levels in order to meet 
the future needs. On the other hand steel manufacturing is one of the largest 
energy- and carbon-­consuming sectors. The global energy consumption in steel-
making is estimated to be about 20 % of the annual industrial energy require-
ments. The fossil fuels represent the main source of heat and reducing agents in 
steelmaking and therefore a major contributor to the global anthropogenic CO2 
emissions. According to the International Energy Agency, the iron and steel 
industry accounts for approximately 6.7 % of total world CO2 emissions (World 
Steel Association 2014; Brown et al. 2012). The CO2 emission from iron- and 
steelmaking was 2.3 billion tons in 2007, and it is expected to reach 3.0 billion 
tons in 2050 (International Energy Agency 2010). Nowadays, the reduction of 
specific energy consumption and gas emissions is coming on the top priorities of 
iron- and steelmaking due to the dynamic growth of energy prices as well as the 
commitment of governments to decrease CO2 emissions according to the Kyoto 
Protocol (Birat and Hanrot 2005). The ironmaking process is the highest CO2 
emission part in steel production due to the intensive utilization of fossil fuels for 
reduction of iron ore to iron and subsequent heating and melting of reduced iron. 
The most common ironmaking process used in the world is the blast furnace 
which produces about 70 % of total world steel production. Recently, the iron-
making processes have undergone tremendous modifications and improvements 
to reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emissions; however, further reduction 
is still required to secure the future sustainability of this vital industry. The modi-
fications and improvements in energy consumption have been offset by increas-
ing the total production, and consequently the CO2 emission has continued to rise 
dramatically. Projections of future energy use and CO2 emissions show that with-
out decisive action and innovative solutions, these trends will be continued. 
Therefore, reducing emissions from iron and steel industry requires sustainable 
and unlimited efforts for the development and deployment of new approaches 
and innovations.

Although the steel industry is energy and carbon intensive, it is important to men-
tion that steel industry represents the core of green economy. The sectors and tech-
nologies which drive the green economy such as wind energy, low-carbon transport, 
clean energy vehicles, fuel-efficient infrastructure and recycling facilities are all 
dependent on steel products. According to EU ambition, an 80 % cut of fossil CO2 
emissions compared to 1990 levels has to be achieved by 2050. The utilization of 
auxiliary fuels in the blast furnace is one of the vital options to reduce the coke con-
sumption and consequently the CO2 emissions. An increasing attention has been 
recently paid on enhancing the replacing rate of coke by more environmentally 
friendly alternative sources. Injection of pulverized coal into the blast furnace is one 
of the most promising options to reduce the coke consumption. The maximum utiliza-
tion of in-plant-generated gases and flue dust as a source of heat and reducing source 
can greatly enhance the overall efficiency of steel industry. The partial substitution of 
fossil fuels, namely, coal and coke, with renewable biomass products in ironmaking 
processes represents one of the few choices which could be introduced in short and 
middle terms to reduce the fossil CO2 emissions (Babich and Senk 2013). The injec-
tion of these different materials in blast furnaces is a great option to reduce the pro-
duction cost, reduce dangerous emissions and increase the productivity. The present 
work discusses and evaluates the recent activities which have been conducted on the 
blast furnace tuyere injectants to reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emissions.
10.1.1  Iron- and Steelmaking Technologies
Steelmaking process can generally be classified into four main different routes 
including blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF), direct reduced iron/elec-
tric arc furnace (DRI-EAF), smelting reduction/basic oxygen furnace (SR-BOF) 
and melting of scarp in electric arc furnace. The BF-BOF route is the most impor-
tant way for steel production using mostly coke and coal as energy and reducing 
agents. The BF-BOF route represents about 70 % of the world steel production. 
The recycling and melting of steel scrap in EAF represent the second important 
route for steel production after BF-BOF and account for 25 % of world steel pro-
duction. The DRI-EAF route uses mainly natural gas as a source of energy and 
reducing agent and produces approximately 5 % of the world steel. The SR-BOF 
route is based on the combustion of coal for the reduction of iron ores without 
agglomeration and produces only 0.4 % of the world steel production.
10.1.2  Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions  
in Steel Industry
In the last 20 years, technology has become one of the main drivers of economic and 
social development. As a result, in 2011, the global consumption of electricity and 
primary energy in the end-use sectors has been sharply increased to reach more than 
10  Recent Trends in Ironmaking Blast Furnace Technology to Mitigate…

176
22,000 TWh and 14,000 Mt, respectively (World Energy Council 2013). The CO2 
emission has been increased from 21 Gt in 1993 to 30 Gt in 2011 with an expecta-
tion to reach 42 Gt in 2020. The total CO2 emission from the industrial sectors is 
about 9.0 Gt from which 2.0–2.3 Gt is emitted from iron- and steelmaking. The 
fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) cover more than 70 % of the total energy usage 
in industrial sectors (Brown et al. 2012). Nowadays, the energy consumption and 
environmental pollution represent the main challenges for steel industry. The blast 
furnace is considered the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in steel 
industry (Kim and Choi 2003). The production of 1.0 ton of rolled coil steel is 
accompanied by about 1.8 tons of CO2 emissions (Birat 2010). The blast furnace, 
sintering and cokemaking contribute together about 90 % of this amount (Pardo and 
Moya 2013). The energy usage in the BF and the accompanied CO2 emission are the 
highest in steelmaking route and account for 12.31 GJ/tHM and 1.22 tCO2/tHM, 
respectively. In the last decades, intensive work has been carried out to reduce the 
coke consumption in the blast furnace. Such efforts have been succeeded to sharply 
minimize the coke consumption by about 60 % since 1960 (Schmöle et al. 2009). 
The partial replacement of coke by injection of other auxiliary fuels such as pulver-
ized coal (PC), natural gases (NG) and oil via blast furnace tuyeres has been com-
mercialized to save coke. Other trials have been conducted on the injection of coke 
oven gas, BOF gas and waste plastics (Babich et al. 2008). In the recent past, the 
coke consumption is in the range of 286–320 kg/tHM, and PC injection is 170–
220 kg/tHM at the majority of the modern blast furnaces (Babich et al. 2002). Over 
decades, the charged burden materials have been improved and adopted to achieve 
low coke consumption, but further improvements for the traditional burden become 
extremely hard. Recently, stable blast furnace operation with PCI rates of around 
200 kg/tHM and coke rate below 300 kg/tHM have been successfully maintained. 
However, higher injection rate of auxiliary materials on account of coke requires 
high quality burden materials and higher oxygen enrichment with sophisticated 
control systems and modifications in the transport and injection systems (Carpenter 
2006). The network gas connection in the integrated steel plant provides a novel 
solution to reach the highest credits through an efficient utilization of by-product 
gases (Mousa et al. 2013a, 2014a; Diemer et al. 2007). Under the impact of the 
global environmental regulations and post-Kyoto requirements, solutions to curtail 
emissions from ore-based steelmaking industry have been launched in the CO2 
Breakthrough Programme (Birat 2010). The modelling and experimental approaches 
are still in action to evaluate the potential for lowering the CO2 emissions, energy 
consumption, operating cost and future sustainability. Based on this, the main chal-
lenge which strongly faces the ironmaking industry today is how to achieve the low 
energy consumption and reduce CO2 emissions with cheaper energy carriers and 
lower-quality raw materials without losing the hot metal quality or the blast furnace 
efficiency. Under this restricted situation, maximizing the auxiliary fuel injection 
into the blast furnace is considered one of the vital options to lower the operating 
cost and maximize the productivity. Usage of cheaper fuels and H2-rich materials 
for partial substitution of metallurgical coke can effectively reduce the CO2 emis-
sions. The next sections will thoroughly discuss the tuyere injection of different 
auxiliaries’ materials into the blast furnace.

10.2  Pulverized Coal Injection into BF
Pulverized coal injection (PCI) is one of the essential methods to enhance the blast 
furnace profitability. Due to the ease of use, oil and natural gas were popular injec-
tants in the 1960s, but due to the oil crises in the 1970s, many companies stopped 
the oil injection and turned to coal injection since the 1980s. Nowadays, the vast 
majority of blast furnaces all over the world apply PCI due to the relatively lower 
cost of coal compared to other fuels beside the beneficial effect on the blast furnace 
efficiency. Injection of PC into the blast furnace provides various economic and 
operational benefits (Bennett and Fukushima 2003). These benefits are including: 
(1) lower consumption of expensive coke, (2) replacing high-rank expensive coal 
with low-grade cheaper coals, (3) longer life period for coke oven, (4) higher blast 
furnace productivity, (5) higher flexibility in BF operation, (6) improving the hot 
metal quality and (7) lower CO2 emissions. The influence of PCI on coke consump-
tion in the blast furnace is given in Fig. 10.1 (Bennett and Fukushima 2003). The 
data has been taken from a range of blast furnaces in Europe (EU), Japan (JP) and 
China (CH). The replacement ratio of PC for coke is about 1.0 at injection rate up 
to 200 kg/tHM. At higher PCI (>200 kg/tHM), there is a reduction in the incremen-
tal replacement ratio of PC for coke. In contrast with other fuels which could be 
injected through tuyeres, PC has the minimum negative impact on the raceway 
flame temperature, and therefore, it has the highest possible injection rate than other 
fuels. Thermal coal which is a type of bituminous coal is often used for injection. 
Thermal coal is relatively cheaper than coking coal which is used for cokemaking,

Fukushima 2003)

178
and this is another economical advantage of PCI. The combustion of PC in the race-
way is a complex process that requires high control of various parameters. Efficient 
PCI is obtained by convenient coal treatment including the control of moisture con-
tent and grain size. The appropriate mixing of PC with hot blast, uniform distribu-
tion of PC across all tuyeres, low N2 input into BF and maximizing retention time 
of coal in the tuyeres are necessary to achieve high combustion efficiency. The 
injection of coal through the tuyeres is certainly not new technology, but it has been 
recently developed to sustain optimum conditions.
10.2.1  PCI Technology
The first step in PCI technology is the production of pulverized coal particles fol-
lowed by pneumatic conveying and then injection into the blast furnace. There are 
dif­ferent processes that can be applied for PC injection into the blast furnace (Waguri 
2003). The Armco pulverized coal injection system is represented schematically in 
Fig. 10.2 (Waguri 2003). The system consists mainly of raw coal feeder, pulverizer 
(mill), dryer, reservoir tank, distributor unit and pneumatic injection unit. The pro-
cess started with coal screening to remove the tramp materials and then it is stored 
in raw coal bunker. The raw coal is pulverized (70–80 % <74 μm) and dried and 
then pneumatically conveyed to cyclone and filters. During this stage the PC is 
thoroughly dried to prevent saltation and compaction and to lower the negative 
effect of moisture on the combustion process. The PC is deposited in a single reser-
voir under inert atmosphere. The PC is fed, under the influence of gravity and pres-
surized nitrogen, into feed tanks which provide continuous flow of pulverized 
particles into the furnace. A single transport pipe carries the coal/gas mixture to a 
coal distributer in which the single stream is divided automatically into multiple 
equal streams of coal/gas mixture and conveyed by a pipe into each tuyere for injec-
tion into the blast furnace. The system is supported with block detector to avoid any 
blockage at tuyeres. The applied injection system has to be selected in order to 
accommodate the on-site design and the local conditions of the blast furnace. The 
injection rate can be also classified into (1) dilute phase and (2) dense phase (Weiser 
et al. 2006). The main difference between the dilute phase and dense phase of PCI 
system is the amount of gas that is used in conveying and injection (Schott 2015). 
The dilute phase is characterized by high gas velocity (more than 10 m/s) and low 
PC concentration (5–30 kg PC/m3 of carrier gas), while the dense phase is charac-
terized by low gas velocity (2–6 m/s) and high PC concentration (100–200 kg PC/
m3 of carrier gas). Due to the high energy consumption and the high wear resistance, 
the dilute phase is less economic compared to the dense phase. The oxygen-enriched 
hot blast (1100–1250 °C) is injected into the blowpipe at velocity 100–200 m/s 
(Sarna 2013). The coal/gas mixture (e.g. 150 kg coal/tHM) is injected by lance into 
the blowpipe at a rate equal to 150 g coal/m3 of the blast. The residence time of PC

in the raceway is very short: 20–30 ms. An alternative method of coal injection 
named granular coal injection (GCI) has been developed and evaluated at Bethlehem 
Steel (Hill et al. 2001). The GCI with a relatively bigger size (70–90 % >74 μm) has 
some economic benefits over normal PCI. The GCI required much less milling 
compared to PC which reduces the capital cost and saves about 60 % of grinding 
energy. At injection rate of 140 kg coal/tHM, it was found that the granular coal 
performs the same efficiency of pulverized coal which indicates that no intensive 
grinding of coal is required under this particular injection rate. On the other hand the 
construction of PC injection lance affects the efficiency of the combustion process. 
Three-­dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is applied to exam-
ine the coal combustion behaviour across the blowpipe, tuyeres and raceway of the 
blast furnace (Du et al. 2015). It was found that the coal combustion efficiency 
increased by 5.1 % using the double lance injection compared to single lance.  
On the other hand the oxy-coal injection lance showed higher coal combustion effi-
ciency at oxygen enrichment higher than 90 %.

10.2.2  PCI Combustion
During the complete combustion of coal particles, three steps could take place. In the 
first step, the volatile matters of coal are released and combusted with the surround-
ing oxygen. These volatiles contain different gases including N2, CO2, H2O and 
small portions of CO, H2 and other types of hydrocarbon gases (CxHy). In the second 
step, the combustion of residual char takes place which has slower rate than combus-
tion of volatiles. In the third step, ash is released after the complete combustion of 
char (Juniper and Schumacher 2013; Ishii 2000). A schematic view of the tuyeres 
and different zones and reactions in the raceway during PC injection is shown in 
Fig. 10.3 (Ishii 2000). The raceway can be classified into three main zones: (1) PC 
de-volatilization zone, (2) oxidation zone and (3) solution loss reaction zone. The 
concentration of oxygen sharply decreases in the oxidation zone due to its reaction 
with carbon of coke and coal to produce CO2 as given in Eq. 10.1. As the oxygen 
concentration decreases, the solution loss reaction by CO2 or steam takes place, as 
given in Eqs.  10.2 and 10.3, and the concentration of CO increases, while CO2 
decreases. Therefore, the reaction rate of PC is basically dependent on the oxygen 
content in the hot blast. The PC injection rate, blast condition (temperature, pressure, 
moisture and oxygen content), coal properties (carbon content, ash content, VM con-
tent, particle size), lance construction and properties of top-charged coke are impor-
tant factors affecting the combustion efficiency of coal in the raceway:

The raceway adiabatic flame temperature (RAFT) is defined as the tempera-
ture that the raceway gas reaches as soon as all C, O2 and H2O are converted to 
CO and H2. The RAFT is a theoretical concept since not all reactions are accom-
plished in the raceway. The RAFT is normally in the range of 1900–2300 °C 
based on PCI rate, PC quality, blast temperature, blast moisture and oxygen 
enrichment. The RAFT is theoretically calculated from Eq. 10.4 (Greedes et al. 
2009) developed using simple mass and heat balance. With increasing PCI, O2 
enrichment is an important factor that affects the RAFT. The O2 content in the hot 
blast has to be adjusted with PCI amount at different production rates (Greedes 
et al. 2009). The higher the PCI rate, the higher O2 enrichment is required to sus-
tain the heat balance in the upper and lower part of the furnace. Too low RAFT 
results in very low top gas temperature which will delay the drying of the cold 
top-charged burden and consequently make the upper shaft less efficient. On the 
other hand too high O2 enrichment in the blast is accompanied by relatively high 
RAFT which will result in an erratic descend of the burden. Therefore, the oxy-
gen content in the hot blast has to be optimized very carefully to reach the proper 
RAFT and shaft efficiency:

10.2.3  High Rate of PCI
For an optimal blast furnace operation using PCI, it is crucial to assure that the 
whole amount of the injected coal is gasified as fast as possible (Schott 2013). 
Estimating the average blast velocity in the raceway at 200 m/s, the residence time 
of small particles travelling with the gas would be ~10 ms (Bortz 1983). The transit 
time of the injected coal particles in the raceway could reach 20–30 ms (Mathieson 
et al. 2005). Within such limited time, the PC particles will not be completely com-
busted, and a considerable amount of char will escape from the raceway region to 
reach the active coke zone as can be seen in Fig. 10.4 (Mathieson et al. 2005).
Various problems could occur due to the high injection rate of PC as can be seen 
in Fig. 10.5 (Juniper and Schumacher 2013). The fine char particles tend to block 
the bed voids and consequently disturb the gas flow and increase the pressure drop 
inside the furnace, reduce the permeability of liquids and gases in the cohesive zone 
and reduce the shaft efficiency and the furnace productivity (Raask 1985; Lu et al. 
2000). Moreover, the high PCI could enhance the carbon solution loss reaction at 
the lower part of the shaft and increase the CO content in the top gas. Since these 
fines are very light, it can be easily fluidized and elutriated which results in higher 
generation of carbon dust from the blast furnace. Therefore, various parameters 
have to be optimized when the blast furnace is working at a high rate of PCI as 
given in the countermeasure in Fig. 10.5. The particle size of the injected coal is 
another factor that significantly affects the efficiency of combustion. The optimum 
size range of PC normally contains ~80 % below 75 μm which has to be dried at 
100–150 °C using an inert gas to remove the moisture (Ghosh and Chatterjee 2008). 
Intensive grinding of coal is not recommended as it will increase the power con-
sumption and could deteriorate the particles flowability during the injection pro-
cess. The hot blast temperature should be high (~1250 °C) to improve the efficiency 
of combustion. The combustion efficiency also depends on the coal rank which is 
related to the calorific value and the mineral contents (Bennett and Fukushima 
Fig. 10.4  Schematic of the lower zone of the blast furnace (Mathieson et al. 2005)
E.A. Mousa et al.

183
2003). The ash content of coal is an indicator of its mineral content, and it is consid-
ered an undesirable component because as the ash content increases, the carbon 
content decreases. Moreover, coals with high ash content will require additional 
basic fluxes which will increase the slag volume and energy consumption and 
reduce the productivity. Coals with higher volatile matter (VM) content exhibit 
superior combustibility due to the higher reactivity; however, coals with very high 
VM contain less carbon, and hence, the combustion efficiency in the raceway will 
be reduced (Ghosh and Chatterjee 2008). Also for high PCI, both sulphur and 
­phosphorus should be kept as low as possible to avoid the negative effect on the hot 
metal quality.
10.3  Auxiliary Fuel Injection
10.3.1  Oil and Natural Gas Injection
The injection of oil and natural gas into the blast furnace was firstly implemented 
before PC, but the energy crisis during the 1970s resulted in more attention to pul-
verized coal injection. Nowadays, the countries which locally produce oil and

natural gas such as the USA, Russia and some other countries are still injecting 
these fuels into the blast furnace to reduce the coke consumption. It was reported 
that 1.0 ton of oil or natural gas replaces 1.2 tons of coke (Worrell et al. 2010; 
Lingiardi et al. 2001). The average consumption of natural gas is 70–100 m3/tHM 
(~50–70 kg/tHM) but often exceeds to 150–170 m3/tHM (~105–120 kg/tHM). The 
operation of blast furnaces using natural gas and oxygen-enriched blast is called 
composite blast technology. With oxy-oil technology the amount of injected oil 
could reach a level of 180 m3/tHM (130 kg/tHM).
Oil and natural gas are decomposed and combusted in the blast furnace raceway 
(De Castro et al. 2002). The decomposition and combustion of hydrocarbons gener-
ate CO/CO2 and H2/H2O. The CO2 and H2O in situ react with carbon of coke and PC 
or with hydrocarbons of natural gas to finally generate CO and H2. The participation 
of hydrogen in the reduction of iron oxide leads to a decrease of CO2 emissions. 
Furthermore, H2 is a more effective reducing agent for wüstite than CO (Meschter 
and Crabaki 1979). The positive influence of H2 on the reduction rate especially at 
elevated temperatures can be attributed to the higher gas diffusivity. The diffusivity 
coefficient of H2/H2O and H2/N2 gas mixtures is about 3–5 times as that of CO/CO2 
and CO/N2 (Bogdandy and Engell 1971; Biswas 1981). In industrial blast furnace 
operation, the equilibrium shifted to more efficient gas utilization and consequently 
lower coke consumption by fuel oil injection (Strassburger et al. 1969). On the other 
hand the injected amount of auxiliary fuels such as heavy oil or natural gas into the 
blast furnace has to be carefully optimized to achieve the low energy consumption 
and high productivity since the reduction of wüstite with H2 is an endothermic reac-
tion and consequently more heat is required compared to the reduction with 
CO. Moreover, the C/H ratio in the injected fuel affects the RAFT. The heat of 
combustion increases as the C/H ratio increases because less heat will be consumed 
in the decomposition of hydrocarbons (Babich et al. 2002). The heavy oil and natu-
ral gas have higher percentage of hydrocarbons compared to coal/coke, and thereby, 
the endothermic effect of these hydrocarbons results in higher drop in RAFT 
(Babich et al. 2008). It was estimated that the RAFT will be decreased by 350–
450 °C per 100 m3/tHM of natural gas injection, 300–350 °C per 100 kg/tHM of 
heavy oil injection, 200–250  °C per 100  m3/tHM of coke oven gas injection, 
80–120 °C of low volatile coal injection and 150–220 °C of high volatile coal injec-
tion (Babich et al. 2002). To compensate the lowering of RAFT, the hot blast must 
be enriched with oxygen. However, the increase in the oxygen content of the blast 
reduces the nitrogen content and causes a drop in the top gas temperature. The top 
gas temperature must always be above the dew point to prevent any undesirable 
condensation of water vapour in the upper part of the furnace. Based on this con-
cept, a minimum raceway adiabatic flame temperature (around 1900 °C) and a mini-
mum top gas temperature (higher than 100 °C) must be maintained to ensure a 
stable blast furnace operation. Recent studies indicated that the rate of natural gas 
injection into the blast furnace could be increased significantly by injecting part of 
the natural gas in the shaft of the furnace. This will reduce the endothermic effect of 
natural gas injection on the RAFT, and the total oxygen consumption would be 
slightly lower compared with the tuyere-only injection (Jampani and Pistorius 
E.A. Mousa et al.

185
2014). A mathematical model based on the heat balance in the bottom segment of 
the blast furnace has been developed to calculate the maximum injected amount of 
natural gas to attain the minimum value of RAFT, minimum possible coke con-
sumption and the minimum direct reduction (Abdel Halim et al. 2009; Abdel Halim 
2007). It was reported that the minimum coke consumption will be obtained when 
the coke carbon which is used as a source of heat is equal to the coke carbon which 
is consumed in the reduction processes (Abdel Halim et al. 2009).
10.3.2  Coke Oven Gas and Converter Gas Injection
The efficient utilization of integrated steel plant top gases becomes necessary to 
achieve profitability to steel mill operation from both economic and environmental 
aspects. The major fuel gases that could be recovered in the integrated steel works 
include blast furnace gas (BFG), coke oven gas (COG) and basic oxygen furnace 
gas (BOFG) (Wingrowe et al. 1999, Worrell et al. 2010). The COG has the largest 
net calorific value in the range of 16.4–18 MJ/Nm3 (STP) compared to that of either 
BOFG (~8.8 MJ/Nm3) or BFG (3.0–3.7 MJ/Nm3) (Diemer et al. 2007; Diemer et al. 
2004). The specific amount of generated coke oven gas is in the range of 410–
560 Nm3/t of coke, while the amount of BOFG is in the range of 50–100 Nm3/t of 
steel in the suppressed combustion system, and it could reach 500–1000 Nm3/t of 
steel in the open combustion system. The annual worldwide metallurgical coke pro-
duction is more than 500 million tons which is produced from about 650 million 
tons of coking coals (Spirin et al. 2015). The cokemaking process is accompanied 
by more than 310 billion Nm3 of COG (Yang et al. 2010). The COG is currently 
used after its cleaning from tar, naphthalene, raw benzene, ammonia and sulphur in 
heating of blast furnace stoves, ignition furnaces in sintering plant, heating furnace 
in rolling mills and electric power generation in power plant (Diemer et al. 2007; 
Diemer et al. 2004).
The estimations which have been carried out on optimizing the energy consump-
tion in the integrated iron and steel works indicated that the utilization of COG for 
power generation is not always the optimal credits (Diemer et al. 2007). The com-
position of COG which is rich with hydrogen is attracting much attention for its 
utilization in the reduction processes (Tovarovskii and Merkulov 2011; Proface and 
Pivot 2011; Matsuzaki et al. 2012; Miwa et al. 2011). The flexibility of COG utiliza-
tion in the integrated steel plant for DRI production through the addition of Midrex 
process is expected to be an efficient method that can introduce many benefits to the 
integrated steel mill (Diemer et al. 2004). The merging of the “traditional” ironmak-
ing blast furnace with the “alternative” direct and smelting reduction processes is an 
innovative approach to achieve the economic and environmental targets of higher 
production and lower emissions. The recent studies which have been carried out to 
evaluate the reduction potential of original coke oven gas (OCOG) and reformed 
oven gas (RCOG) for direct reduction of iron ore pellets compared to reformed 
natural gas (RNG) indicated the high efficiency of these gases for DRI production 
10  Recent Trends in Ironmaking Blast Furnace Technology to Mitigate…

186
(Mousa et al. 2013a, 2014a). An optimization for the reforming of coke oven gas is 
crucial to avoid the severe crack of pellets in the case of reduction with RCOG and 
the carbon deposition in the case of OCOG as shown in Fig. 10.6. The reduction 
potential of COG with/without mixing with converter gas (BOFG) has been studied 
for natural lump ore at 800–1050 °C (Mousa et al. 2014a, b). It was reported that the 
highest reduction rate was achieved with RCOG followed by OCOG. The reduction 
rate was decreased in the order of RCOG > OCOG > RNG > OCOG-BOFG > RCOG-­
BOFG at 900–1050 °C.
The injection of COG into the blast furnace through tuyeres has influence on the 
raceway conditions and iron ore reduction. The mathematical modelling on the 
injection of COG into the blast furnace tuyeres indicated better combustion condi-
tions and higher injection rate by using two injection lances compared to one lance 
(Hellberg et al. 2005a, b; Slaby et al. 2006). The temperature distribution in the blast 
furnace with different levels of COG injection is given in Fig.  10.7, while the 
­reduction distribution with different H2 levels is given in Fig. 10.8 (Wang et al. 
2011; Chu et al. 2012). The thickness of softening-melting zone decreases while the 
reduction is improved by increasing COG and H2 injection into blast furnace, 
respectively. The combustion of COG hydrocarbons in the front of tuyeres by blast 
oxygen results in generation of carbon monoxide and hydrogen gases which increase 
the potential of reducing gas on account of inert N2 (Hellberg et al. 2005a, b). The 
theoretical calculation and commercial trials which were carried out on the replace-
ment of natural gas with coke oven gas in blast furnace showed lower coke con-
sumption and higher hot metal production (Nogami et al. 2012). The high efficiency 
of COG is due to the fact that it contains 3.5–4.0 times less hydrocarbons compared 
to that of natural gas (Babich et al. 2008). This improves the combustion in the 
tuyere hearth, activates coke column and increases gas utilization in the furnace. A 
higher amount and higher heating value of blast furnace top gas under COG injec-

tion have been noticed (Nogami et al. 2012). The injection of COG into the blast 
furnace is practiced in some countries with different injection rates from about 30 to 
280 m3/tHM (Kovalenko et al. 1989; Bürgler et al. 2004). It was reported that the 
maximum level of COG injection into the blast furnace is 100 kg COG/tHM according

to the thermochemical conditions, while the replacement ratio is 0.98 ton of coke/t 
of COG (United State Environmental Protection Agency 2012). The reduction of 
iron ore sinter under simulated conditions of different injection levels 
(0–300 m3 COG/tHM) of COG into the blast furnace has been investigated (Mousa 
et  al. 2013b). The isothermal and non-isothermal reduction trials illustrated the 
enhancement of the reduction rate of sinter under the injection of COG due to the 
higher concentration of reducing agents (H2 and CO) on account of inert N2 (Mousa 
et al. 2013b).
10.3.3  Waste Plastic Injection
Recycling and utilization of waste plastics have received an increasing interest in 
the recent decades. The majority of this material is currently being landfilled or 
incinerated which causes environmental problems. The combustion of waste plas-
tics generates hazardous pollutants, such as dioxins/furans, as well as undesirable 
carbon dioxide. The waste plastics can be efficiently utilized in blast furnaces as an 
alternative reducing agent and as a source of heat to reduce the coke consumption. 
As the plastics contain hydrogen and carbon, it can also provide additional benefits 
similar to oil and natural gas injection into the blast furnace. Due to the difficulty of 
waste plastic crushing, coarse particles were preferred to be injected into the fur-
nace; however, the fine particles are better in combustion in the raceway. Therefore, 
a technology for fine pulverization of waste plastics has been developed and imple-
mented in a full-scale industrial blast furnace in Japan. Since the collected waste 
plastics are a heterogeneous mixture from different types, it is recommended to 
conduct heat treatment at 200 °C before its injection into the blast furnace. The 
pretreatment will generate a homogenous pulverized waste plastic mixture 
(Asanuma et al. 2014). Moreover, the pretreatment of waste plastics will perform 
de-chlorination for the plastics containing chlorine such as polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) and hence avoid the corrosive effect on the blast furnace tuyeres and the 
refractory materials in hearth lining.
The gasification and combustion behaviour of waste plastic were studied experi-
mentally and followed by mathematical analysis (Murai et al. 2015). It was found 
that the rate of gasification of unburnt char depended on the rate of heating. As the 
rate of heating increased, the gasification process of waste plastic increased. The 
injection of relatively small particle size of plastics generates unburnt char with 
small size which leaves the raceway and flow up to be consumed at the cohesive 
zone by direct reduction of iron ore. On the other hand the coarse plastics generate 
bigger size of unburnt char which accumulates around deadman in the blast furnace 
and consequently reduces the permeability at the lower zone of the blast furnace. 
The injection of waste plastic could increase the coke reactivity; however, such 
effect will be correlated with the reactivity of coal char and the ash content of coke 
(Babich et al. 2009, 2015). It was reported that the gasification and combustion 
efficiency of waste plastics are improved by the implementation of co-injection

lance (Carpenter 2010). The small coal particles (75 μm) are adhering on the outer 
surface of larger plastic particle (~3 mm) and generate heat form combustion. This 
heat is supplied directly to the particles of waste plastic and enhances the combus-
tion process. The theoretical limit of waste plastic injection is estimated to be 70 kg/
tHM, while the higher injection rate will result in problems similar to that obtained 
with the relatively high PCI as previously illustrated in Fig. 10.5. Every tonne of 
plastics used in the blast furnace can replace 750  kg of coke (The Industrial 
Efficiency Technology Database 2013). Injection of waste plastics into the blast 
furnace is able to reduce the CO2 emissions by 30 % due to the higher H2 content 
(Carpenter 2010). On the other hand the cost of waste plastic collection and treat-
ment is still representing one of the main challenges for its implementation in iron-
making. Efficient and effective systems are required to achieve sustainable and 
reliable supply of waste plastic into the blast furnace.
10.3.4  Secondary Material Injection
There are different types of secondary materials often generated in the integrated 
steel plant such as slags, filter dust and sludge. These materials are rich with iron 
and carbon and can be efficiently recycled to produce hot metal by its injection into 
the blast furnace. The injection of blast furnace flue dust and its influence on the 
coke consumption and hot metal quality have been tested in LKAB experimental 
blast furnace (EBF), and it has been applied in a full-scale blast furnace (Jansson 
and Sundqvist Ökvist 2004; Sundqvist Ökvist 2004a). It was found that the injec-
tion of flue dust improves the coal combustion efficiency and the slag formation in 
the raceway. In EBF, the injection of 23.4 kg flue dust/tHM reduced the coke and 
coal consumption by 21 kg/tHM. The silicon content in the hot metal was slightly 
decreased due to the relatively higher slag basicity with flue dust injection. The blast 
furnace flue dust contains about 23 wt.% of Fe2O3 which is directly reduced in the 
raceway and also improves the oxygen potential in this zone for the combustion of 
pulverized coal. The injection of iron ore fines into the blast furnace through tuyeres 
was actively studied in the 1980s in order to efficiently use the waste materials and 
increase the productivity. The tuyere injection of iron ore fines could achieve vari-
ous advantages to the ironmaking blast furnace represented in lower top charging of 
pellets and sinter, more flexibility in controlling the raceway flame temperature and 
hot metal quality, utilization of low quality iron ore and possibility of higher pro-
ductivity (Naito et al. 2006). On the other hand the injection rate of fine iron ore has 
to be adjusted with the injection rate of PC and the condition of hot blast. The cal-
culation based on the raceway heat balance indicated that 184 and 100 kg/t of iron 
ore fines can be injected with 100 and 200 kg/tHM of PCI, respectively. The prere-
duction of iron ore fines up to 60 % can increase the injected amount to 594 kg/tHM 
provided that the temperature of hot blast has to be 1800 °C (Naito et al. 2006). This 
relatively high temperature of hot blast can be achieved by plasma superheating. 
The iron waste materials and the fines generated from direct reduction process such

190
as unexploited direct reduced iron (DRI) and low reduced iron (LRI) represent valu-
able materials and can be injected into the blast furnace. It was reported that the 
charging or injection of the pre-reduced iron ore into the blast furnace is expected 
to improve the efficiency of the overall process by increasing the productivity and 
decreasing the energy consumption (Naito et al. 2006; Kunitomo et al. 2006; Born 
et al. 2012a, b). The reduction behaviour of DRI/LRI in CO-CO2-O2 gas atmosphere 
was investigated (Born et al. 2011). Under reducing atmosphere (40 % CO–60 % 
N2), LRI exhibited higher reduction rate compared to DRI due to the higher wüstite 
content. Under the effect of the oxidizing atmosphere of hot blast, reoxidation took 
place for DRI/LRI followed by full reduction to metallic iron.
Some blast furnaces all over the world are working with 100 % pellets (Sundqvist 
Ökvist 2004a). When fluxed pellets and basic fluxes are charged into the blast fur-
nace, excessive basic slag is formed in the cohesive zone. Such phenomenon has a 
negative impact on the permeability of the cohesive zone and bosh region. Under 
such conditions, the injection of basic fluxes together with pulverized coal through 
tuyeres represents one of the possible solutions for this problem (Wikström et al. 
2002). Trials on BOF slag injection into EBF have been conducted. The BOF slag 
has basicity of about 4.0 and has valuable amount of Fe and Mn (Sundqvist Ökvist 
2004b). The furnace has achieved excellent performance with 11 kg/tHM reduction 
in the reducing agent compared to the reference case (Wikström et al. 2002).
10.3.5  Biomass Injection
Biomass comes back to appear in the horizon as one of the promising solutions to 
mitigate the CO2 emissions in the steel industry. Biomass charcoal was used as 
energy source in ironmaking process till 1880; after that it became illegal, in many 
parts of the world, to use the biomass in the metallurgical applications in order to 
protect the natural forest against the irrational and oppressive exploitation at that 
time. Nowadays, the renewable energy has attracted more public and policy atten-
tion particularly for its impact in the mitigation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions. The recent analysis of the long-term potential for renewable energy in 
industrial applications suggested that up to 21 % of total energy use in manufactur-
ing industry in 2050 could be covered by renewable origin materials (Taibi et al. 
2012). This will compensate about 50 exajoules per year (EJ/year) from the total 
energy (230 EJ/year) used in the industrial sectors. It was reported that the utiliza-
tion of renewable biomass in the industrial sector has the potential to reduce the 
GHG emissions by 10 % in 2050 (Ladanai and Vinterbäck 2009). This represents 
25 % of the total expected emission reductions of the industrial sectors and is equiv-
alent to the total current CO2 emissions from Germany, France, Italy and Spain 
together (Ladanai and Vinterbäck 2009). The global production of biomass and 
biofuel is growing rapidly due to the fluctuation of fossil fuel prices, growing envi-
ronmental concerns and higher considerations regarding the security and diversifi-
cation of energy supply. Although the world’s bioenergy potential is large enough to 
meet the global energy demand in 2050, criteria to ensure the sustainable

191
production and supply of biomass are still unclear and required more attention 
(Taibi et al. 2012). The sustainable and constant supply of biomass resources is not 
the only challenge for its future impact, but the establishing of economic and effi-
cient upgrading technologies to convert the raw biomass to valuable bioproducts 
with desired mechanical, physical and chemical properties represents another chal-
lenge for its efficient application in steel industry. The top charging of biomass into 
the large blast furnace still suffers from some problems which are related to the 
lower mechanical strength and the high volatile matter compared to coke. In order 
to overcome such problem, tuyere injection provides a flexible option for biomass 
utilization in the large modern blast furnace. In this case the mechanical strength is 
not required; however, the combustion behaviour of biomass is a very important 
factor affecting the RAFT. A static heat and mass balance model has been applied to 
investigate the substitution rate of biomass products (charcoal, torrefied material 
and wood pellets) for PCI (Wang et al. 2014, 2015). It was found that 166.7 kg/tHM 
charcoal is able to fully replace 155 kg/tHM PCI. The torrefied material and wood 
pellets could partially replace PCI by 22.80 % and 20 %, respectively (Wang et al. 
2015). Charcoal demonstrated the highest potential for PCI substitution with almost 
insignificant change in top gas temperature. The oxygen enrichment in the hot blast 
has to be increased to 24.7 %. On the other hand the top gas temperature was found 
to be decreased by the injection of torrefied material and wood pellets. Based on 
these results, the maximum injection rate of torrefied material and wood pellets was 
found to be 134.2 kg/tHM and 98.9 kg/tHM, respectively, at the minimum allowed 
top gas temperature. Moreover, if the O2 content in the blast is limited to 25.4 %, the 
maximum amount of torrefied biomass and wood pellets has to be decreased to 
60.7 kg/tHM and 59.1 kg/tHM, respectively. The high level of volatile matter in the 
torrefied material and wood pellets reduces the RAFT, and hence, more O2 enrich-
ment in the hot blast is required. The reactive structure of charcoal improves the 
combustion process in raceway to become comparable to that of coal (Babich et al. 
2010; Mathieson et al. 2012). It was reported that the maximum injection rate of 
charcoal will be in the range of 200–220 kg/tHM which is able to reduce the net CO2 
emissions by 40 % (Feliciano-Bruzual and Mathews 2013). Beside the environmen-
tal benefits, the injection of charcoal will result in lower amount of slag and higher 
production rate due to the low sulphur and ash content and higher content of CaO 
compared to PCI (Suopajärvi 2014). The results of mathematical modelling indi-
cated an increase in the blast furnace productivity by about 25 % when 100 kg/tHM 
of charcoal is injected with 150 kg/tHM pulverized coal with an optimization of the 
oxygen enrichment (De Castro et al. 2013). Although the investigations and the 
commercial trials which have been conducted on biomass injection into the blast 
furnace demonstrated many benefits, its application is not practiced yet in the large 
modern blast furnaces. The practical limitations could be summarized in four main 
points (Feliciano-Bruzual and Mathews 2013): (1) less calorific value of biomass 
products compared to coal which required efficient pretreatment and pyrolysis, (2) 
difficulties in biomass injection at high rate due to the porous nature and the low 
density which required an optimization for the injection process, (3) wider particle 
size distribution of biomass after grinding which required an efficient sieving to get 
the proper particle size for injection and (4) higher alkalis in biomass products 
10  Recent Trends in Ironmaking Blast Furnace Technology to Mitigate…

192
which should be controlled and minimized before utilization to avoid its negative 
impact on the refractory materials. In addition, the higher cost of biomass products 
compared to that of fossil fuels represents another challenge for its implementation. 
Besides the policy instruments such as carbon tax or CO2 allowance, it is important 
to reduce the production cost of biomass products. Both novel biomass upgrading 
processes and optimizing the existing process are required.
10.4  Summary
The blast furnace ironmaking has undergone tremendous modifications and 
improvements to reduce the energy consumption and CO2 emissions. One of these 
modifications is injection of different auxiliary fuels into the furnace through tuy-
eres. Although the injection of pulverized coal through tuyeres has been applied a 
long time ago, continuous development is being done to sustain the blast furnace 
optimum conditions at the highest pulverized coal injection rate. The recent modifi-
cations in pulverized coal injection include development in the technology of pul-
verizing system and construction of the injected lance. An evaluation of the 
combustion process in the raceway and its influence on coke consumption, hot 
metal quality, process efficiency and furnace productivity are investigated. The 
injection of auxiliary fuels which are rich with hydrogen such as oil and natural gas 
is still applied in some blast furnaces in the world; however, it is based on the local 
availability of such fuels and the operation flexibility. The relatively higher hydro-
carbon content in such fuels compared with pulverized coal reduces the flame tem-
perature in the raceway and required higher oxygen enrichment in the blast to 
overcome the cooling effect. The generated coke oven gas and converter gas in the 
integrated steel plant can be used more efficiently in the integrated steel mill to 
achieve more consistent profits. These gases have relatively higher percentage of 
CO and H2 in addition to higher calorific value compared to the blast furnace off-
gas. In addition, these gases have lower hydrocarbons compared to natural gas and 
fuel oil, and it can be injected at a higher rate to significantly reduce the coke con-
sumption and CO2 emissions. The waste plastics can be efficiently injected into the 
blast furnace as an alternative reducing agent to fossil fuels; however, the collection 
system and pretreatment methods are still representing the main challenges for its 
efficient implementation. The injection of secondary materials which are rich in 
iron and carbon such as BOF slag and flue dust is able to save the raw materials and 
reduce the solid and gas emissions. The partial replacement of fossil fuels with 
renewable biomass products represents one of the few options which can be intro-
duced in short-medium terms to further reduce CO2 emission from the steel indus-
try. The mathematical modelling and system analysis demonstrated that charcoal 
has the highest potential for full substitution of pulverized coal; however, the higher 
price of charcoal compared to fossil fuels and the lack of knowledge about its future 
sustainability are representing the main challenges for its wide utilization in the 
steel industry.

 Low CO 2 Emission by Improving CO 
Utilization Ratio in China’s Blast Furnaces  
 Mingyin  Kou ,  Laixin  Wang ,  Jian  Xu ,  Shengli  Wu , and  Qingwu  Cai 
 Abstract   In recent years, the CO 2 emission in China is the highest all around the 
world, accounting for about 30 %. China’s 15 % CO 2 emission is produced from iron 
and steel companies, where blast furnace contributes more than 60 %. Therefore, 
blast furnace is the key to reduce CO 2 emission for iron and steel companies. Blast 
furnace is a countercurrent reactor between descending burdens and ascending gas. 
The higher the CO utilization ratio is, the lower the CO 2 emission. There are two 
main measures to improve CO utilization ratio—upper adjustment and lower adjust-
ment. The upper adjustment is mainly about the burden distribution which includes 
adjusting batch weight, charging mode, stock line and so on. The lower adjustment 
is mainly about the gas distribution in the lower part of the blast furnace, which 
includes adjusting the gas volume, gas temperature, gas humidity and so on. The 
paper presents the upper and lower adjustments to improve CO utilization ratio in 
China’s blast furnaces. 
11.1  Introduction 
 In recent years, the CO 2 emission in China stays in the ﬁ rst place all around the 
world, accounting for about 30 % (Olivier et al.  2014 ). One of the largest CO 2 emis-
sion contributors is the iron and steel companies, whose CO 2 emission occupies

about 15 % of the total CO 2 emission in China. As the largest subsystem, the iron-
making process has about 90 % CO 2 emission of the iron and steel companies. And 
the CO 2 emission of the blast furnace exceeds 70 % of the ironmaking process. It 
can be found that blast furnace encounters very huge stress. Therefore, it is impera-
tive to study blast furnace in order to reduce its CO 2 emission (Zhang et al.  2013 ; 
Liu et al.  2015 ). 
 Blast furnace is a countercurrent reactor between descending burdens and 
ascending gas, consisting of complicated transfer processes of heat, energy and 
momentum. Therefore, the smooth descending of burdens and the reasonable distri-
bution of gas are the key to maintain a steady and smooth operation of blast furnace. 
The higher the CO utilization ratio is, the lower the CO 2 emission. There are two 
main measures to improve CO utilization ratio—upper adjustment and lower adjust-
ment (Wang  2013a ). 
 The upper adjustment is mainly about the burden distribution, which determines 
the second or third distribution of gas ascending from the lower part of blast furnace. 
The aim of burden distribution is to obtain reasonable radial distribution of ore/coke 
at throat. When burden is uniformly distributed at the throat, gas will be also uni-
form. In this way, the heating and reduction of burden by gas will also be adequate, 
which leads to a higher CO utilization. The upper adjustment mainly contains batch 
weight, charging mode, stock line and so on (Wang  2013a ; Xiang and Wang  2014 ). 
 The lower adjustment is mainly about the initial gas distribution in the lower part 
of the blast furnace. The initial gas distribution is the priority of the second or third 
one. When the initial gas distribution is reasonable, there will be only little work to 
be done, or it is much easier to obtain a better gas distribution in the upper part of 
shaft furnace. The lower adjustment mainly contains the gas volume, gas tempera-
ture, gas humidity and so on (Wang  2013b ; Xiang and Wang  2014 ). 
 Generally speaking, the effects of the lower adjustment are relatively timely and 
remarkable, while those of the upper adjustment will take a longer time to show. In 
practice, the upper adjustment and the lower adjustment are usually matched 
together to acquire a better gas distribution and a higher CO utilization.  
11.2  The Upper Adjustment 
11.2.1  Batch Weight 
 Batch weight has a critical value. When the batch weight is larger than the critical 
value, burden in the centre part of the blast furnace throat will become thicker with 
the increase of batch weight of ore, and the burden distribution will become evener; 
when the batch weight is smaller than the critical value, ore cannot reach the centre 
part of the furnace, and burden thickness in the peripheral part will become thicker 
with the increase of batch weight. 
 There is a relationship between the batch weight and the ratio of the burden 
thicknesses in peripheral and central area, which is illustrated in Fig.  11.1 (Liu 
 2005 ).
M. Kou et al.

201
 Where  y h is the burden thickness in peripheral part,  y c is the burden thickness in 
central part and  W is the batch weight. The  y h / y c line is usually divided into three 
zones, which are cataclysmic zone, slow-changing zone and slight-changing zone 
from left to right, respectively. When the batch weight belongs to the cataclysmic 
zone, the burden thickness in the central part will be thicker with the increase of 
batch weight; when it belongs to the slight-changing zone, the burden distribution 
can be hardly affected by the increase of batch weight; and when it belongs to the 
slow- changing zone, the effect of batch weight on the burden distribution will also 
be between the cataclysmic zone and slight-changing zone. In the slight-changing 
zone, the burden and gas distributions are stable, which are beneﬁ cial to obtain 
smooth operation and high CO utilization ratio. Therefore, the batch weight should 
be kept in the slight-changing zone. If there are too many powders in burdens, the 
batch weight should be kept in the slow-changing zone in order to prevent the bur-
den blockages in central and peripheral areas (Liu  2005 ). 
 Channelling will  be  frequently occurred when the batch weight is too small. The 
gas will be blocked by overweighted burden when the batch weight is too large. The 
batch weight determines the thickness of the layered burdens. This means that when 
the batch weight increases, on one hand, the burden layers will be thicker, and the 
area of “coke window” will be also increased and the permeability will be also 
improved as a result. On the other hand, the number of burden layers will be reduced, 
then the “interface effect” between coke and ore will be also weakened, which also 
improves the burden permeability (Wang  2013b ). 
 In the No. 3 Blast Furnace of Jiuquan Steel, the ore batch weight increased from 
17.6 to 22.2 t, and the coke load increased from 4.0 to 4.2 (which means the coke 
batch weight increased from 4.40 to 4.78 t). The CO utilization ratio was increased, 
and the coke rate decreased from 438 to 428 kg/t (Bao  2008 ).

202
 In No. 2 Blast Furnace of Shougang Jingtang United Iron & Steel Co. Ltd, the 
ore batch weight increased from 148 to 165 t, and the coke load increased from 5.00 
to 5.44 at the same time in 2011. Smooth operation was enhanced, and the silicon 
content also kept about 0.3 % (Zhang et al.  2012a ). 
 After three trials on large ore batch weight, the reasonable ore batch weight was 
found to be 100–115 t for 3200 m 3 blast furnace in Laiwu Steel. When the ore batch 
weight increased from 85 to 100–115 t, the fuel rate and the pressure drop decreased 
by 10 kg/t and 7 kPa, respectively (Mu et al.  2012 ). 
 In 2008, the ore batch weight went up from 10 to 21 t gradually in No. 4 blast 
furnace (inner volume: 400 m 3 ) of Nanjing Steel. Compared with the ore batch 
weight before adjustment, the CO 2 content in the top gas increased 0.2 %, and the 
blast furnace productivity increased by 0.49 t/m 3 d −1 (Lan and Wang  2009 ). 
 The ore  batch weight was  increased from 56 to 77 t in Benxi Steel. As a result, 
the gas distribution was stable, and CO utilization ratio was also increased by about 
3 % (Zhu and Zhang  2009 ). 
 Huang et al. suggested that the coke layer thickness should between 500 and 
700 mm, and the ore batch weight should be 0.95–1.20 % of daily production 
(Huang et al.  2015 ). 
 Hang and Wu thought the reasonable ore batch weight should be 0.012–0.015 of 
blast volume. The calculated ore batch weight was 55–68 t in No. 7 Blast Furnace 
of Jiugang Steel (Hang and Wu  2012 ). 
11.2.2  Charging Mode 
 In the beginning, blast furnace is usually with bell top. The bell is used to store 
burdens and then goes down to discharge burdens into the blast furnace. However, 
the bell charging mode has some disadvantages, like bad sealing performance in the 
top, severe burden and gas segregations and so on. Therefore, the bell-less top blast 
furnace top is created. Blast furnaces are almost with bell-less top in China nowa-
days. The bell-less top will be only discussed in this paper. 
 The  bell-less top blast furnace can be generally divided into three types based on 
the hoppers’ location. The ﬁ rst type is parallel-type hoppers, which means that two 
hoppers are allocated on both sides of the centreline (see the left one in Fig.  11.2 ). 
The second type is serial-type hoppers, which means that two hoppers are allocated 
along the centreline of the blast furnace, and one is upper hopper, and the other is 
lower hopper (see the right one in Fig.  11.2 ). The third type is multi-hoppers, which 
means there are no less than three hoppers located around the centreline of blast 
furnace. There is no multi-hopper blast furnace yet in China, so it will not be dis-
cussed in this paper (Xiang and Wang  2014 ).
 No matter parallel hopper or serial hopper, they both use rotating chute to dis-
charge burdens from hopper into blast furnace. Therefore, charging mode of rotat-
ing chute is of signiﬁ cant importance to burden and gas distributions and further the 
CO utilization. The rotating chute usually has 8–12 rings corresponding to different 
angles. It can achieve many distributing modes due to its ﬂ exibility. 
M. Kou et al.

203
 In general, there are four typical types of distributing  modes  : single-ring dis-
tributing, multiring distributing, ﬁ xed-point distributing and sector distributing. 
The former two modes are usually used in practical operation, while the latter two 
are only used when the gas distribution is not normal. The burden trajectory, bur-
den stack shape and size distribution are directly determined by the rotating chute. 
The “terrace + funnel” burden stack shape is the most favourable one in China. 
Coke is easier to form a terrace, and the amounts of coke and ore can be adjusted 
based on the terrace. If the terrace is narrow and the funnel is deep, the burden 
stack will not be stable. On the contrary, if the terrace is wide and the funnel is 
shallow, the central gas ﬂ ow will be suppressed. Once the terrace is developed, it 
should not be changed too much since the coke terrace controls the ore/coke ratio 
and size distribution in blast furnace. 
 Du and Guo proposed that the reasonable width of coke terrace should be 
1.2–2 m for large-sized blast furnace and 0.8–1.2 m for middle-sized blast furnace. 
For example, the width of the coke terrace of the No. 2 blast furnace in Baosteel is 
1.5 m (Du and Guo  1995 ). Li et al. suggested that the width of coke terrace should 
be 0.8 m and the depth of the funnel should be 1.5 m in the 1750 m 3 blast furnace of 
Ji’nan Steel (Li et al.  2006 ). 
 Wang et al. moved the main striking point of ore away from centre about 0.7 m and 
the main striking point of coke away from centre about 0.6 m by changing the charg-
ing modes in Shougang No. 2 blast furnace (inner volume: 1780 m 3 ) from March to 
April in 2008. As a result, the gas temperature in the top decreased from 200 to 
180 °C, and the CO utilization ratio increased from 46 to 49 % (Wang et al.  2009 ).

 Lu et al. used C  3 38 °  2 36 °  2 33.5 °  2 30.5 °  2 27.5 °  4 17 °  O 2 38 °  3 36 °  3 33.5 °  3 31.5 °  1 28.5 °  to develop the gas 
ﬂ ow in both peripheral and central gas at the beginning after the blow-in of No. 
2 blast furnace (inner volume: 2500 m 3 ) of Chongqing Steel, then changed it to 
C 2 41 °  2 39 °  2 36.5 °  2 33.5 °  2 30.5 °  3 23 °  O 2 41 °  3 39 °  3 36.5 °  2 33.5 °  2 30.5 °  to inhibit the  peripheral gas ﬂ ow . After 
the adjustment, the CO 2 concentration increased from 18 to 20.0–21.0 %, and the 
comprehensive coke rate also decreased from 525 to 500 kg/t (Lu et al.  2012 ). 
 Table  11.1 shows the changes of charging mode from February of 2008 to March 
of 2012 in TISCO No. 5 blast furnace (inner volume: 4350 m 3 ). It can be seen that 
the CO utilization increased from 49.9 to 50.5 % (Li et al.  2013 ).
 Another technique is also adopted to the burden charging in China, which is 
central coke charging. This technique charges coke in the central area of the blast 
furnace in order to develop central gas ﬂ ow. Jingtang No. 1 blast furnace of 
Shougang group employed the central coke charging in 2011 to conquer the deterio-
ration of raw and fuel materials and obtain a long and  stable operation condition 
(Wang et al.  2013 ). However, this mode is not good to increase the CO utilization 
ratio in the blast furnace. When the amount of coke in the centre increased 1 %, the 
CO utilization ratio decreased 0.317 % (Teng et al.  2014 ). When the raw and fuel 
materials deteriorated, the central coke charging mode was adopted to keep a stable 
operation in No. 2 blast furnace of Shougang Jingtang. A higher CO utilization ratio 
was achieved, but it was still 1.5 % lower than the period with no central coke charg-
ing (Zhang et al.  2012b ). Therefore, many companies cancelled the central coke 
charging to increase the CO utilization ratio, such as the No. 9 blast furnace in 
Xinyu Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., No. 2 blast furnace in Ji’nan Steel and so on (Zhou 
et al.  2015 ; Meng et al.  2010 ). 
 The advantages of the “terrace + funnel” are high CO utilization ratio and low 
fuel rate, but this mode requires a stable quality of raw and fuel materials. However, 
the central coke charging mode can adapt to the quality ﬂ uctuations of raw and fuel 
materials, but the disadvantage of this mode is low CO utilization ratio, which usu-
ally ranges at 46.5–48.5 % (Zhu  2014 ).

11.2.3  Stock Line 
 As for the bell-less top blast furnace, the  stock line is deﬁ ned as the vertical distance 
between the 0 m stock line and the burden stack surface. And the 0 m stock line is 
deﬁ ned as the level of chute tip when the chute is vertically still or the position of 
top edge of steel brick in the blast furnace throat (Wang  2013b ). 
 Changing the stock line equals to change the height of burden free falling zone 
and then to change the burden striking point. Therefore, it is matched with the initial 
angles of rotating chute. When the stock line is heightened, which means that it is 
close to the 0 m stock line, the burden striking point will move towards the centre, 
then the peripheral area is loosened and beneﬁ cial to developing peripheral gas. 
When the stock line is lowered, the burden striking point will move towards the 
wall, then it helps to develop the central gas (Liu  2005 ). 
 The stock line is related to the blast  furnace  throat, inside proﬁ le of the blast 
furnace top, burden properties and so on. Since the burden striking point can be 
controlled by the angles of the rotating chute, the stock line does not usually change 
once it is found suitable for the blast furnace operation. Generally, the stock line is 
controlled at 1–2 m (Xiang and Wang  2014 ). 
 When the practical stock line is higher than the preset stock line, the angles of the 
rotating chute should be adjusted to prevent burden from hitting on the furnace wall. 
Table  11.2 illustrates the angle compensations at different stock lines (Xiang and 
Wang  2014 ).
11.3  The Lower Adjustment 
11.3.1  Gas Volume 
 Generally speaking, the more the  gas volume is, the more the pig iron blast furnace 
produces, but the gas volume should not be too high. In order to have a high CO 
utilization and low fuel rate, the gas volume should be appropriate. The gas volume 
increases with the increase of blast furnace volume, but the ratio of gas volume to 
furnace volume almost stays at 1.6–1.7 Nm 3 /m 3 (Li  2011 ). If the ratio of gas volume 
to furnace volume is too small, the blast furnace hearth will not be active enough, 
and permeability will be worsened, and the operation will not be smooth. Therefore,

a relative high ratio slows down the erosion of gas on the furnace wall and prevents 
the furnace accretion, then helps to keep smooth operation (Lin and Xiang  2012 ). 
 When the appropriate gas volume is reached, it will not be changed much any-
more. Then a common way to adjust the gas is to change the tuyere area. Generally, 
reducing the tuyere area increases the gas velocity, and it is beneﬁ cial to the devel-
opment of central gas; increasing the tuyere area decreases the gas velocity and 
helps to develop peripheral gas. When the amount of PCI (pulverized coal injection) 
increases or the quality of the raw and fuel materials deteriorates, the tuyere area 
should be reduced to develop central gas. For example, Qiu et al. decreased the 
tuyere area from 0.4248 m 2 in 2011 to 0.4076 m 2  in 2012 in order to perform the 
injection of bituminous coal for No. 3 blast furnace of Laiwu Steel (Qiu et al.  2014 ). 
 There were 24 tuyeres with 130  mm  diameter and 8 tuyeres with 140 mm diam-
eter in No. 5 blast furnace of WISCO, so the total tuyere area was 0.4417 m 2 . 
However, the number of tuyere with 140 mm diameter was reduced to 2, and the 
total tuyere area was 0.4331 m 2 , in order to cope with the deterioration of the raw 
and fuel materials (Hu  2012 ). 
 In 2011, the tuyere area was changed from 0.4278 to 0.3957 m 2 in the 3200 m 3 
blast furnace of Laiwu Steel, and it turned out that the CO utilization ratio was 
improved, and the fuel rate decreased from 522 to 512 kg/t (Lin and Wang  2013 ). 
 The  tuyere area was also changed to increase production and reduce fuel rate for 
No. 2 2500 m 3 blast furnace of Xuanhua Steel from 2010 to 2011, as shown in 
Table  11.3 (Hao  2011 ).
 It can be seen that coke rate  almost  decreases with the decrease of tuyere area. 
And the gas volume should increase gradually after the reduction of tuyere area.  
11.3.2  Gas Temperature 
 The main sources of the heat needed for blast furnace are the combustion heat of 
fuel and the physical heat of blast gas. The more heat the gas brings into blast fur-
nace, the less heat the fuel needs to combust. Therefore, high gas temperature can

decrease the fuel rate and the cost of pig iron. At the same time, more coal can be 
injected to the blast furnace to replace some coke due to high gas temperature. 
Table  11.4 shows the amount of saving coke corresponding to the high gas tempera-
ture (Wen et al.  1996 ).
 Many steel companies have high gas temperatures over 1200 °C, and typical 
technical indexes of some companies in 2014 are given in Table  11.5 (Wang  2015 ).
 Table  11.6 shows some main technical and economical parameters of some 
advanced blast furnaces from January to June of 2011 in China (Zhang  2013 ).
 Chen et al. reported that when the blast  gas  temperature increased from 1240.7 °C 
in 2008 to 1258.7 °C in 2009 in Qian’an Steel’s No. 2 blast furnace, the coke rate 
decreased from 295 to 287 kg/t, while the coal rate increased from 164 to 172 kg/t 
(Chen  2010 ). 
 Guo et al. also tried to increase the gas temperature in No. 1 blast furnace of 
Chongqing Iron and Steel Company from 2010 to 2012. The main technical and 
economical parameters are given in Table  11.7 . It can be found that the coke rate 
decreases greatly when the blast gas temperature increases (Guo et al.  2013 ).
 Wang and Li reported the change of blast gas temperature in 2200 m 3 blast fur-
nace in Angang Iron and Steel Company in 2006. Table  11.8 illustrates some typical 
parameters (Wang and Li  2007 ).
 From 2004 to 2007, the blast gas temperature of No. 2 blast furnace in Meishan 
Steel increased from 1131 to 1223 °C, and the coal rate increased from 109 to 
158 kg/t, while the coke rate decreased from 393 to 227 kg/t (Wang  2008 ). 
 Table  11.9 shows some main economic indicators of No. 7 blast furnace in Benxi 
Steel from 2005 to 2010 (Huang  2011 ).
 Zhu reported that the blast gas temperature in 2500 m 3 blast furnace for Chengde 
Iron and Steel Company  increased  by 7.1 °C in 2012 from 1211.5 °C in 2011, the 
comprehensive coke rate decreased by 14.4 kg/t (Zhu  2013 ).

11.3.3  Gas Humility 
 At the beginning, the  gas humility keeps at the value it originally has. However, the 
gas humility varies day by day, which results in unstable blast furnace operation. In 
order to solve the problem of the variation of gas humility, there are two ways: one 
is humidiﬁ ed blast and the other is dehumidiﬁ ed blast. Humidiﬁ ed blast is to ﬁ x the 
humility at a relatively high value to keep a stable furnace operation. But the water 
vapour brought by humidiﬁ ed gas needs to be decomposed, which consumes the 
heat in blast furnace. When the gas humility increases by 1 %, the coke rate will be 
increased by 4–5 kg/t, otherwise, the gas temperature needs to be increased by 
25 °C. Dehumidiﬁ ed blast is to ﬁ x the humility at a low value. It reduces the heat 
consumed by the decomposition of water vapour and increases the theoretical com-
bustion temperature, then decreases the coke rate. Therefore, the amount of CO 
generated at the lower part of blast furnace will decrease, then the CO utilization 
will increase as a result. Generally, when the gas humility decreases by 1 g/m 3 , the 
coke rate can be decreased by 0.8–1.0 kg/t (Xiang and Wang  2014 ). 
 The dehumidiﬁ ed blast has been applied to No. 1 blast furnace in Liuzhou Steel 
since 2010. The gas humility decreased from 20 to 6~7 g/m 3 , and the fuel rate 
decreased by 9.2 kg/t as a result (Huang et al.  2013 ). 
 Yao et al. also reported that  the  gas humility decreased from 18.3 to 10 g/m 3 for 
No. 3 blast furnace in Hangzhou Steel from 2011. As a result, the coke rate decreased 
from 373 to 357 kg/t, and the CO 2 content at the top of the furnace increased from 
18.81 to 19.23 %, which indicated a better CO utilization ratio (Yao et al.  2012 ).

11 Low CO2 Emission by Improving CO Utilization Ratio in China’s Blast Furnaces

210
 In 2011, the No. 8 blast furnace in Nanjing Steel adopted the dehumidiﬁ ed blast 
technique, and some main technical and economical parameters before and after the 
dehumidiﬁ ed blast technique are shown in Table  11.10 (Wang  2013b ).
 The coke rate also decreased by 17.3 kg/t when the gas humility decreased by 
7.7 g/m 3 for No. 2 blast furnace in Meishan Steel (Tao  2010 ). 
 Zhang et al. reported that the fuel rate decreased by 18.40 kg/t, while the 
production increased by 27.51 t/d after the application of dehumidiﬁ ed blast 
in 2005 in 2500 m 3 blast furnace of Stainless Steel Branch of Baosteel 
(Zhang et al.  2006 ). 
11.4  Conclusions 
 The principle of upper adjustment and lower adjustment is that they should be 
suitable for each other. When the peripheral gas in the lower part of blast furnace 
is developed, then the upper adjustment should not block the peripheral gas heav-
ily. The upper adjustment should gradually open the central gas and control the 
peripheral gas at the same time in order to prevent the sudden block of peripheral 
gas, which may affect the smooth operation of blast furnace. Likewise, when the 
central gas in the lower part is overdeveloped, the upper adjustment should not 
block the central gas immediately, but should open the peripheral gas properly 
and then release the overdevelopment of central gas. Above all, the upper adjust-
ment and lower adjustment should not form confrontation. The CO utilization 
ratio can be increased remarkably with the cooperation of the upper adjustment 
and lower adjustment.

 Dioxin Emission Reduction in Electric 
Arc Furnaces for Steel Production 
 Pasquale  Cavaliere 
 Abstract   Steel production through electric arc furnaces has strongly increased in 
the past decade. Dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) are the main 
type of greenhouse emissions in such kind of plants. The main factors inﬂ uencing 
the emissions levels are the composition of raw materials, the processing conditions 
employed during melting, and the adsorbent effects of additional compounds added 
before ﬁ ltering. Many techniques have been experienced in the recent past to 
improve the abatement of emissions levels. In the present chapter, the greenhouse 
emissions belonging to an industrial steel electric arc furnace are monitored in dif-
ferent processing condition setups. The effect of lignite and CuCl addition on the 
dangerous emission levels have been deeply investigated.  
12.1  Introduction 
 Electric arc furnaces (EAFs) are employed in the steel industry to melt scraps at 
very high temperatures by using electric arcs (normally divided into high-pressure 
and low-pressure arcs). Graphite electrodes are the main sources of electrical 
energy; the electric arc leading to the material melting burns between the electrodes 
and the metal; those arcs are normally divided into high current and ultrahigh cur-
rent (if the current exceeds 10 kA). Normally, oxygen is blown into the furnace 
using an oxygen lance; such oxygen, combined with the carbon, leads to the forma-
tion of a foam slag that works as a protective agent. Many studies focus on the 
efﬁ ciency of reducing the chemical energy loss by increasing the oxygen content in 
the furnace. During reﬁ ning, the removal of carbon and further inorganic impurities, 
such as phosphorus, sulfur, silicon, manganese, aluminum, chromium, etc., is car-
ried out by the oxygen lances. The oxidized elements are risen and enter the slag 
phase, which coats on the surface of the molten steel. This phase consists of the 
oxides of the impurities and slag former materials (CaO, MgO). Once the impurities

are removed from the steel, their separation is carried out during the deslagging 
phase, when the furnace is tilted and the slag is poured out through the slag door. 
Apparently, during each phase of normal EAF operation, emission of fumes and 
gases is presented and can be divided into primary and secondary emissions. 
Generally, if carbon monoxide content in the exiting gases diminish below the ﬂ am-
mability limit and the rest cannot be burned at the combustion gap, if the tempera-
ture remains high, the generated carbon dioxide could dissociate to carbon monoxide 
and oxygen, which would form dioxins in the downstream of the off-gas system. 
Consequently, the carbon monoxide and dioxin content of the off-gases are very 
high. The homogenous temperature is achieved through the employment of oil 
burners. Electric arc furnace and sintering plants (Cavaliere and Perrone  2013 ) rep-
resent the main sources of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans 
(PCDD/Fs) during steel production processes. Even if sinter plants are considered 
the main sources of dangerous dioxin emissions, the use of EAF for steel production 
is strongly increased, and this fact leads to a strong attention in their use and man-
agement. The high energy consumption of the EAF motivates the development of 
control and optimization strategies that would reduce production costs, while main-
taining targeted steel quality (steel grade) and meeting environmental standards. 
The knowledge about optimized melting conditions of various types of scraps is 
limited to results belonging to statistical analyses, and the description of the rela-
tionships between the system efﬁ ciency and the greenhouse emission levels is very 
poor. Both PCDDs and PCDFs are persistent stable organic pollutants formed in all 
those high-temperature processes with an abundance of organic material in the pres-
ence of chlorine and copper. Dioxins and furans are chlorinated tricyclic organic 
compounds resulting from the combination of organic compounds impregnated 
with halogens (i.e., ﬂ uorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine) with a speciﬁ c molecular 
heterocyclic structure. A deep and complete thermodynamic description of the 
PCDD/F formation has been presented (Tan et al.  2001 ). These compounds are 
commonly grouped under the name “dioxins,” but their chemical structures and 
their properties can be very different. Dioxins are a class of heterocyclic organic 
compounds whose basic structure consists of rings with four carbon and two oxygen 
atoms. On the other hand, furans have only one oxygen atom, and the two outer 
benzene rings are linked by a pentagonal structure. Among the 200 types of known 
dioxins, the most famous are certainly the PCDDs, characterized by the presence of 
chlorine atoms that will complement the aromatic rings. The chemical stability of 
such compounds derives from the presence of these rings. The most dangerous of 
dioxins, for serious problems of bioaccumulation and environmental contamina-
tion, is certainly TCDD. A detailed description of their formation is presented in the 
literature (Kulkarni et al.  2008 ; Raghunatan and Gullet  1996 ; Suzuki et al.  2004 ). 
The PCDDs are generally measured in terms of TEQ relative to TCDD as a refer-
ence, being the most polluting and dangerous. The polydibenzo-dioxins have differ-
ent toxicities in relation to their structure. The TEQ expresses the quantity of a 
“toxic” substance as the concentration of the reference substance that can generate 
the same toxic effects of TCDD. It is also possible to obtain the concentration of a

PCDD with its toxic equivalency through the use of the TEF. The TEF for TCDD is 
assigned equal to 1, while the other dioxins have a factor of <1. This dimensionless 
parameter, multiplied by the actual concentration, results in the TEQ. Many studies 
presented in literature report the effect of processing factors and off-gases ﬁ ltering 
on dioxin emissions (Prüm et al.  2004 ; Öberg  2004 ; Chang et al.  2006 ). The main 
factors inﬂ uencing the emissions levels are the composition of row materials, the 
processing conditions employed during melting, and the adsorbent effects of addi-
tional compounds added before ﬁ ltering. Many techniques have been investigated in 
order to improve the abatement of dioxin levels. The techniques converge on the 
activated carbon adsorption or catalytic oxidation (Everaert and Baeyen  2004 ). 
From these studies, the employment of activated carbon results in the best available 
technique to reduce the dioxin levels from EAF. Anyway, these techniques require 
a very precise control of gas temperature in order to result efﬁ cient. Another efﬁ -
cient solution is the Cu chloride addition; in presence of urea, the addition leads to 
a strong reduction in PCDD/F formation (Li et al.  2008 ). Normally, dioxin com-
pounds are destroyed at higher temperatures, but dioxins reform in the off-gas at 
lower temperatures. Such parameter is fundamental in monitoring the dioxin behav-
ior and in the setting of optimal plant parameters in order to reduce dangerous emis-
sions. In the present paper, both the process parameter tuning and the additive 
addition, all ﬁ nalized to the PCDD/F reduction, are analyzed and the results pre-
sented. It is demonstrated how the optimal management of processing parameters 
and the precise utilization of additives lead to a strong reduction in dangerous emis-
sions from EAFs. 
12.2  Electric Arc Furnace Operations 
 The electric arc furnace investigated in the present study is a 100 t furnace designed 
for a maximum ﬂ ow rate of 1500 Nm 3 /h. The stack off-gases are emitted in the 
atmosphere through a 32 m height stack. In EAF, graphite electrodes carry the cur-
rent through the furnace roof into the charge of metal. The electric arc formed melts 
the charge at very high temperatures. The melting sequence for the electric arc fur-
nace comprises the different stages: charging, melting, oxidization, and tapping. 
The waste gases produced in the furnace are extracted through an aperture in the 
furnace roof and the dust from various sources in the housing. The waste gas is 
cooled to recover heating as steam, hot water, or electric energy and is then dedusted 
by cloth ﬁ lters. In some operating conditions, the dust from the electric furnace can 
contain considerable quantities of heavy metals, such as zinc and lead, and so it is 
worth recovering them. After ﬁ ltering, the examinations of the off-gases were per-
formed according to EN 1948 parts 2 and 3, EN 1948SS (Sampling Standards, 
Wellington Laboratories), EN 1948ES (Extraction Standards, Wellington 
Laboratories), and EN 1948IS (Injection Standards, Wellington Laboratories), by 
employing a high-resolution gas chromatograph and a high-resolution selective

mass detector. The emission levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and poly-
chlorinated dibenzofurans are determined through a 12 h monitoring per each 
experimental condition in a time range of 4 years. Many experimental conditions 
belonging to different plant setup were monitored. These conditions are summa-
rized in Table  12.1 in terms of plant processing parameters. Flow rate, coke, and gas 
temperature were considered as processing parameters of the electric arc furnace. In 
all the conditions, different quantities of lignite were added in order to monitor the 
effect on dioxin emissions. For selected experiments, 5 mmol of CuCl were added 
to the charge.
12.3  Greenhouse Emission Reduction 
 The main results of this study can be summarized as follows. Dioxin emissions 
decrease as ﬂ ow rate increases (Fig.  12.1 ); very low rates of coke lead to an increase 
in dioxin emissions for low ﬂ ow rate.
 In correspondence of high ﬂ ow rates, dioxin emissions decrease in correspon-
dence of intermediate values of coke rate. Such behavior is a good indicator of plant 
efﬁ ciency; a high ﬂ ow rate corresponding to a high plant efﬁ ciency leads to emis-
sion lowering. Also for high efﬁ ciency, coke rate should remain from low to inter-
mediate values. Dioxin emissions decrease as the gas temperature and the ﬂ ow rate 
increase (Fig.  12.2 ).
 Dioxin compounds form in a temperature range of 200–600 °C with a maximum 
in the range 250–400 °C. The maximum levels of dangerous emission concentration 
are recorded at intermediate values of temperature and ﬂ ow rate. Such behavior is 
time dependent; in this way, the more time off-gases remain at a stable temperature, 
the more dioxin formation is allowed. In this way, it is easy to demonstrate that, as 
increasing the gas ﬂ ow and tuning the gas temperature far from the dangerous range, 
the emission levels are strongly reduced. In this way, it is not only the temperature 
that plays a role in the reaction kinetic but also the reaction rate due to the gas ﬂ ow. 
The rapid cooling of off-gases coupled with high ﬂ ow rate represents an optimal 
solution in reducing dioxin formation and improving the plant efﬁ ciency. Such a 
process control system can be used to regulate the furnace stability by working at 
operating parameters that reduce dioxin production in the plant. As a matter of fact,

many plant layouts employ off-gas post-combustion to destroy PCDD/Fs, but such 
system does not eliminate dangerous product formation. 
 Dioxin emissions decrease from low to intermediate values of coke rate; such 
reduction is ampliﬁ ed by lignite injection (Fig.  12.3 ).
 Lignite coke can be employed to reduce dioxin/furan concentration when it is 
used as an adsorbent to the waste gas ﬂ ow. PCDD/Fs are strongly reduced thanks to 
the lignite addition because of its strong bonding irreversible action on dangerous 
emissions and the further decomposition during heat treatment phase. Lignite is 
injected into the gas ﬂ ow acting as a strong redactor of dioxin and furan emissions. 
Normally, the lignite injection is operated in different points of the gas ﬂ ow pattern 
with various percentages; in the present study, the global addition of lignite to the 
exhaust gases is considered. For high coke rate levels, dioxin emission increases 
also with lignite injection. By taking a look to the dioxin evolution as a function of 
gas temperature and lignite injection, a strong decrease of emissions as temperature 
and lignite increase can be underlined (Fig.  12.4 ) even if lignite injection is still 
active at high gas ﬂ ow temperatures.
 A strong effect on the reduction of dioxin emissions is noted for the addition of 
CuCl. In Fig.  12.5 , a strong reduction of emission level for the same lignite addition 
is due to the presence of CuCl.

12.4  Conclusions 
 An electric gas furnace designed for a maximum ﬂ ow rate of 1500 Nm 3 /h was moni-
tored in the present study. Different processing parameters were employed in order 
to measure the variation of dioxin and furan emissions to atmosphere. The results of 
the experimental analyses conduced to the main following conclusions:
 –  Dioxin emissions reach low levels at high ﬂ ow rate and intermediate coke rates. 
Such result has been identiﬁ ed as a good instrument to control the PCDD/Fs 
control during the process.  
 –  Also the temperature increase has a beneﬁ cial inﬂ uence on dioxin and furan 
reduction. 
 –  Lignite injection leads to a reduction in greenhouse emissions. 
 –  An important effect on emission reduction is due to the addition of CuCl during 
processing.

 Abstract   The present chapter describes the determination of emissions of high 
toxic airborne pollutants (dioxins, dibenzofurans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons, and polycyclic carbonyl biphenyls) from electric arc furnaces during the pro-
duction of steel. By using the European Standard method CEN 1948 for dioxin-like 
compound sampling and measurement, it was possible to determine the characteris-
tic ﬁ ngerprint of these micropollutants emitted by this particular stationary source. 
13.1  Introduction 
 Several well-known experimental evidences (Anderson and Fisher  2002 ; Wang 
et al.  2003 ) have concluded that steel production is an industrial activity character-
ized by atmospheric emission sources potentially emitting microorganic pollutants 
to the atmosphere (Buekens et al.  2001 ). 
 Electric arc furnace (EAF) steel production from ferrous scrap has been recog-
nized as a potential source for  organic micropollutant emission such as  dioxins 
(polychlorodibenzodioxins—PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , and polycyclic carbonyl biphenyls ( PCBs ) . Usually, 
the formation of dioxin-like compounds requires the presence of organic com-
pounds known as precursors such as phenols, chlorobenzenes, PCBs, and chlorine, 
catalytic substances such as cooper or any other heavy metals, and a reaction tem-
perature between 200 and 600 °C (Altwicker et al.  1989 ). 
 PCBs, unlike other highly  toxic compounds , such as PCDDs and PCDFs, are 
almost noncombustible, have very low vapor pressures at room temperature, are 
nonvolatile and non-soluble, have considerable thermal and chemical stability, and

are resistant both to acid and alkali substances (Erickson  1997 ). Therefore, they 
have been used as  dielectric ﬂ uids in electrical transformers and condensers, as 
adhesive, paints, hydraulic lubricants, etc. Nevertheless, its toxicity has been widely 
demonstrated, resulting in the restriction of PCB involvement in several applica-
tions. Both PCBs and PAHs have been reported as emitted from the steel and metal-
lurgic industries, namely, when scrap is melted again in recycling processes, such as 
steel making from scrap via the  EAF process (Anderson and Fisher  2002 ; Buekens 
et al.  2001 ). 
 Therefore, the study of the formation mechanism regarding these compounds 
during  steel production in the EAF is quite important in order to deﬁ ne effective 
measures so that the emissions of dioxin-like compounds could be controlled by 
means of its operational parameters. 
13.2  EAF  Plant Description 
 Experimental measurements were made on an EAF installed in a steel mill in 
Northern Portugal. The EAF is a DEMAG unit, originally built in 1976, type UHP, 
having a power consumption of 48 MVA which produces 77 t of melted steel per 
heat, from 92 t of inlet material. Each production cycle lasts 2 h, operating continu-
ously in day and night shifts. The type of scrap and raw materials used is presented 
in Table  13.1 . Table  13.2 shows the actual quantities of raw materials, products, and

by-products (in ton) during measurement tests. Exhaust gases are collected in a 
hood and send through a pipe of two independent stacks, working simultaneously, 
the extraction ﬂ ow being 135,000 Nm 3 /h.
 Each stack is equipped with different dedusting systems, each consisting of a bag 
ﬁ lter device, indicated here as “A, Old system,” and “B, New system.” The ﬂ ow 
sheet concerning the gas cleaning section is presented on Fig.  13.1 . The total gas 
handling capacity is of 180,000 Nm 3 /h. Both units work simultaneously in order to 
achieve a better abatement of pollutants. Unit “A, Old system,” has a gas handling 
capacity of 80,000 Nm 3 /h and a ﬁ ltering area of 2480 m 2 , whereas the unit “B, New 
system,” has a capacity of 100,000 Nm 3 /h and a ﬁ ltering area of 2800 m 2 .
 The nominal design  outlet  concentration for total suspended dust is 20 mg/Nm 3 . 
13.3  Emission Measurements 
 Stack sampling measurements were made after the dedusting units both for “A, Old 
system,” and “B, New system,” units. A partial volume of the ﬂ ue gas—e.g., gas includ-
ing dust—is extracted via a glass tube from the ﬂ ue gas duct and led into the collection 
system. The glass probe is installed centrically in a water-cooled probe of titanium. By 
the means of cooling water, a rapid cool down of the sample is executed (Fig.  13.1 ). 
The collection system consists of a condensate ﬂ ask, receiving the accumulating con-
densate and a part of the dust, and of a cartridge with two polyurethane foams, a special 
sorbent with proven efﬁ ciency for the separation of organic substances. The foams are 
installed on both sides of a plane ﬁ lter with high collection efﬁ ciency. 
 Connecting to this is an equipment group consisting of drying tower, gas pump, 
and gas volume meter. A sampling standard (C-13-labeled 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDF, 
1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8,9-HpCDF) is added to the condensate ﬂ ask before

sampling. The ﬂ ow of the sampled gas stream is adjusted to isokinetically 1  conditions 
on the sampling nozzle. 
 The  sampling  procedure is in compliance with the EU-Standard EN 1948, part 1 
(CEN  1996a ), using the alternative C-water-cooled probe. Emission samples were 
analyzed according to the European Standard EN 1948 parts 2 and 3 (CEN  1996b ,  c ). 
Quantitative determinations of PCDD/PCDF in various samples were made accord-
ing to the isotope dilution method with the use of the following 2,3,7,8-substituted 
13C-UL internal standards. Afterward the extraction of the samples with appropriate 
solvents from the condensate, the PU foam, the plane ﬁ lter was made. Additionally, 
the glass sampling tube was cut into pieces and extracted too. Cleanup was done in 
multicolumn systems involving carbon-on-glass ﬁ ber or carbon-on-celite. HRGC/
HRMS measurements were made with VG-AutoSpec using SP2331 and/or DB-5 
capillary columns. For each substance, two isotope masses were measured. 
Quantiﬁ cation is carried out with the use of internal/external standard mixtures. 
Seventeen congeners of PCDD/PCDF were determined, according to standard EN 
1948, part 3 (CEN  1996c ), as follows:
  (a)  PCDD: 
 2,3,7,8-TCDD (D1); 1,2,3,7,8-PCDD (D2); 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDD (D3); 1,2,3,7,8,9-
HxCDD (D5); 1,2,3,6,7,8-HpCDD; 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDD; 1,2,3,6,7,8-HpCDD; 
1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD (D6); 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-OCDD (D7)  
 (b)  PCDF: 
 2,3,7,8-TCDF (F1); 1,2,3,7,8-PCDF (F2); 2,3,4,7,8-PCDF (F3); 1,2,3,4,7,8-
HxCDF (F4); 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF (F5); 1,2,3,7,8,9-HxCDF (F6); 2,3,4,6,7,8-HxCDF 
(F7); 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF (F8); 1,2,3,4,7,8,9-HpCDF (F9); 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9- OCDF 
(F10).  
 Regarding polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic carbonyl biphenyls, 
the sampling technique was again based on the European Standard method EN 1948 
(CEN  1996a ), which speciﬁ cally concerns dioxin and dibenzofuran sampling and 
analysis, as previously mentioned. However, certain modiﬁ cations were introduced 
in order to isokinetically sample PAHs and PCBs. The analytical determinations 
were performed in a HRGC/HRMS, VG- AutoSpec using capillary column DB5. 
PAH analysis included the determinations of 16 congeners,  deﬁ ned according 
USEPA, using deuterated extracts ranging from D 8 to D 14 as follows:
 Naphthalene 
 Benz(a)anthracene 
 Acenaphtalene 
 Chrysene 
 Acenaphtene 
 Benzo(b)ﬂ uoranthene

nozzle is the same as that of the gas in the duct at the sampling point (ISO  2003 ).

 Regarding PCBs, the analysis covered the  isomers 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, and 180 
and total homologue using internal standards marked with  13 C. For the utilized sam-
pling volumes, the detection limit both for PAHs and PCBs was determined at 
0.01 mg/m 3 . The basic sampling procedure, using a cooled probe, was the same 
already described  for  dioxins and dibenzofurans. However, the sampling time was 
now considerably reduced to about an hour. Particulate matter was collected on a 
ﬁ lter, and the gaseous phase was collected by condensation on an adsorbent agent. 
After sample recovery, the sampling train was decontaminated using water and ace-
tone. Filters and adsorbents are mixed together for extraction with an organic sol-
vent by Soxhlet and then concentrated in a rotovapor device. It is necessary to 
remove any interferents from the ﬁ nal extract before performing the chromato-
graphic analysis by HRGC/HRMS.  The  determinations are made by adding internal 
and external deuterated standards as follows: 
 Naphthalene 
 D 8 
 Acenaphthylene

 The same sample was used for determination of PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, and 180 
and total homologue. This later determination was made using the following inter-
nal standards:
 2,4,4′-Tri-PCB (PCB 28) 
 13 C-UL 
 2,2′,5,5′-Tetra-PCB (PCB 52) 
 13 C-UL 
 2,2′,4,5,5′-Penta-PCB (PCB 101)

 13 C-UL 
 2,2′,3,4,4′,5,5′-Hepta-PCB (PCB 180) 
 13 C-UL 
 After the addition of standards, samples were extracted with nanograde-speciﬁ c 
solvents. The procedure for  interferent removal , already described for PAHs, was 
 also  used here prior to the chromatographic determination. 
13.4  Discussion 
 The summary of obtained results is presented in Table  13.3 .
 Our experience shows that, in general, uncertainties in the range of 10–20 % for 
the components listed in the above tables. For values close to the detection limit, the 
uncertainties are higher. Based on the measurements made, Figs.  13.2 and  13.3 
show the existence of individual species  of  dioxins and furans, in the picogram

range, with a prominence of 2,3,4,7,8-pentaCDF in all measurements. In this plot, 
the existence of 17 searched compounds was veriﬁ ed. The obtained values are not 
homogeneous with some dispersion of the obtained results, for congeners and 
also for the total of the dioxins/furans. However, observing Figs.  13.4 and  13.5 , the

existence of a coherent proﬁ le is veriﬁ ed. It can be noted that this kind of proﬁ le is 
always observed during the operation of this EAF system and is nondependent of 
the gas ﬂ ow rate neither of the EAF actual processing capacity. The average value 
obtained in these measurements is of 0.18 I-TEQ ng/m 3 . However, registered values 
are very high (in the order of the 0.83 I-TEQ ng/m 3 ), but very low values (approxi-
mately 0.05 I-TEQ ng/m 3 ) were also measured. The variations observed can possi-
bly be explained by different production regimes, using different loads for the 
furnace, which were observed during sampling operations. These measurements are 
considerably long, about 6 h, and generally 4–6 different charges (comprising dif-
ferent loads) each, which contributes to the observed variability in the amount of 
micropollutants. Nevertheless, it can be noticed that the proﬁ le of analyzed conge-
ners seems to be nearly the same for all the sampling trials.

 It should be noted that, within the scope of the mentioned European Standards, 
there is no standardized method for the determination of the uncertainty of measure-
ment that covers both sampling and the analytical procedure as well as the uncer-
tainty related with the conditions of the sampling site in special. For this reason, the 
single results are not supplied with information on uncertainty. 
 Our experience shows that, in general, uncertainties lie in the range of 10–20 % 
for the components listed in the above tables. For values near the detection limit, the 
uncertainties might be higher. 
 Based on the performed  measurements , Fig.  13.6 shows the existence of indi-
vidual species of PAHs, where a prominence of naphthalene, acenaphthylene, phen-
anthrene, and ﬂ uorine could be noticed. Other species such as ﬂ uoranthene, pyrene, 
acenaphtene, and chrysene were also found in lower amounts. As a whole, the exis-
tence of 12 of the 16 searched species of PAHs was veriﬁ ed, as benzo(a)pyrene, 
indene(1,2,3)-cd-pyrene, benzo(ghi)perylene, and dibenz(a,h)anthracene were not 
detected. Carefully observing this ﬁ gure, with a zoom from anthracene on, the 
 existence of a coherent proﬁ le is also veriﬁ ed, and this is the actual “ﬁ ngerprint” of 
this process in terms of PAH emissions . In fact, it can be noted that this proﬁ le is 
always observed during the operation of this EAF system and is nondependent of 
the gas ﬂ ow rate neither of the EAF actual processing capacity.

 The observed variations can possibly be explained by different production 
regimes, using different loads for the furnace, which were observed during sam-
pling operations. 
 Table  13.4 presents the  main  physical and chemical properties (Erickson  1997 ) 
of the measured PAHs. It can be noticed that the species that were not found present 
in the stack emissions are the species with ﬁ ve and six benzene rings, which have 
strongly adhered to dust particles and, thus, are collected by bag ﬁ lters as dust- 
capturing devices (Fig.  13.7 ).
 It was also found that the dedusting systems, apart from retaining dust and ﬁ ne 
particulate, are mainly maintaining the presence of the compounds that are solid 
samples, as they are not producing different concentration proﬁ les but are only 
attenuating them, that is, are reducing its concentration, as can be seem on Fig.  13.8 
for PAHs.
 From the measured, the following observations should be highlighted: 
 For the gaseous phase, before the dedusting unit, high quantities of all micropol-
lutants are detected, while after the dedusting unit, only residual quantities are 
detected in the gaseous efﬂ uent samples (Table  13.5 ).
 The ﬁ ngerprint proﬁ le of PCDDs/PCDFs determined in gaseous samples col-
lected in the main duct shows a consistent proﬁ le. The relative amount of 
 concentrations for micropollutant species are higher for PAHs and then PCBs and 
lowest for PCDDs/PCDFs, both for samples collected before and after the dedusting 
unit. The observed proﬁ les for PCDDs/PCDFs are slightly different from samples 
collected before and after the dedusting unit. While for samples before the dedust-
ing unit, OCDD and OCDF show concentration peaks, in samples collected after the

observed proﬁ le for PAHs is slightly similar both from samples collected before and 
after the dedusting unit. 
 In what regards PCBs, the same does not happen and a slight variation on the 
“ﬁ ngerprint”  proﬁ le before and after the dedusting system occurs. 
 For the particulate phase, samples of dust collected from the dedusting unit show 
high quantities of micropollutants, mainly of PAHs and PCBs but not PCDDs/PCDFs,

when compared with samples of dust collected from the bottom of the stack, before 
the dedusting unit. Samples of dust collected from the bottom of the stack, before the 
dedusting unit, are almost free of PCBs as the detected concentrations for these com-
pounds are only very near the detection limits of the analytical methods. The  ﬁ nger-
print proﬁ le for all micropollutant species (PCDDs/PCDFs, PAHs, and PCBs) is 
slightly similar for both samples collected before and after the dedusting unit. 
 These observations suggest that the installed dedusting units seem efﬁ cient for 
removal of particulate matter from the gaseous efﬂ uent. As these species of micropol-
lutants usually are aggregated into the particulate phase, this also makes the dedusting 
units efﬁ cient for removal of micropollutants from the gaseous efﬂ uent. Thus, micro-
pollutants are then collected in the dust removed in the dedusting unit. Apparently, the 
observed difference between ﬁ ngerprint proﬁ les for the micropollutant species in the 
gaseous phase indicate that highly chlorinated species such as OCDD and OCDF 
were formed near the EAF, and they reduce their relative amounts probably due to the 
temperature reduction in the dedusting unit itself. As a whole, there are considerable 
reductions of PCDDs/PCDFs from samples before and after the dedusting unit, when 
comparing both gaseous and particulate phases. For PAHs, the latter behavior is the 
opposite, when comparing gaseous and particulate phases. For PCBs, these species 
diminish in the gaseous phase from before to after the dedusting unit and become 
apparent in the particulate phase after the dedusting unit, which could be due to the 
decrease in temperature that makes for its aggregation to the particulate phase, and 
thus less  higher molecular weight PCBs are detected in the gaseous phase. This simi-
lar behavior, regarding higher  molecular weight compounds , is also true for PAHs. 
 All these suggest that two different mechanisms exist regarding two different 
zones having considerably different temperatures: one mechanism is responsible for 
the generation of these compounds near the EAF (where temperature is higher) 
governed by the de novo synthesis and possibly facilitated by the presence of metal-
lic catalysts.

13 Emission of High Toxicity Airborne Pollutants from Electric Arc Furnaces…

234
 In the duct and after the EAF, where temperature is lower, a mechanism based on 
organic precursors coming from contamination of the scrap seems to govern. This 
latter mechanism could also be enhanced by the presence of metallic catalysts as 
heavy metals are also frequently detected in the ﬂ ue gas. 
13.5  Conclusions 
 The principal kind of emissions from electric arc furnace operations is described in 
the present chapter. A very clear proﬁ le  of  dioxins and dibenzofurans does exist 
which can be considered as the emission ﬁ ngerprint for this process. The obtained 
concentrations are higher in the new system, where the majority of gas ﬂ ow (55 %) 
and also the ﬁ ltration area are bigger (53 %), and thus a higher concentration of 
reactive species could be expected to exist in the new system. Dispersion is observed 
in each group for both the old and new system. As this scrap is considered to be 
non-contaminated and thus precursors are, a priori, nonexistent, there is a possibil-
ity of occurrence of heterogeneous reactions over particulate surface at tempera-
tures higher than 300 °C, but as the oven temperature is higher than 1500 °C, certain 
organic species are destroyed. However, it is believed that the basic conditions for 
occurrence of de novo synthesis (without organic precursors) do exist. This can be 
enhanced at temperatures higher than 250 °C and by the occurrence of metallic spe-
cies acting as catalysts. 
 These studies have, so far, allowed to derive some important conclusions on the 
emission of gaseous micropollutants, making possible to determine the characteris-
tic proﬁ le (also known as “ﬁ ngerprint”) of PCDDs/PCDFs, as well as PAHs and 
PCBs. 
 In fact, in spite of some observed variability in successive sampling campaigns, 
it was possible to determine regular concentration proﬁ les of the gaseous emissions 
of the sampled compounds. This is the basic information that will allow, further on, 
to derive further conclusions on the mechanisms of formation/destruction of these 
species and, at a later stage, to deﬁ ne operational strategies to perform the abate-
ment of these emissions. 
 It should be noted that the observed existence of PAH and PCB species, which 
are PCDD/PCDF precursors, could easily result in the formation of PCDD/PCDF 
congeners by the means of heterogeneous reactions, on the surface of particles and 
dust that occur at temperatures higher than 300 °C (Wang et al.  2003 ).

 Use of Sustainable Inorganic Binders 
in the Treatment of Bag-House Dust 
 Beste  Cubukcuoglu 
 Abstract   Cementitious materials are the most popular binding agents used in the 
treatment of hazardous waste to convert it from an unstable to a more stable form. 
The use of ordinary Portland cement (PC) or other hydraulic binders (such as poz-
zolanic power plant ﬂ y ash) in the solidiﬁ cation/stabilisation (S/S) process is one of 
the best available methods for the treatment of waste that cannot be reduced, 
destroyed or recycled. 
 There are many other studies and researchers who agree that PC is the main 
binder being used to solidify and immobilise pollutants into a solid form (Li et al., 
J Hazard Mater 82:215–230, 2001). In addition to cement, pozzolanic materials are 
also used for this purpose. These mainly include PFA, blast furnace slag, silica 
fume, natural or modiﬁ ed clays and sand (Poon et al., Waste Manage Res 3:127–
142, 1985). Although cement was selected as the main binder in the S/S technique, 
it was realised in the past century that it has detrimental effects on the environment 
and human health. The production of cement causes large amounts of carbon emis-
sions to be released into the environment and involves an overuse of natural 
resources (Middendorf et al., Lime pozzolan binders: an alternative to OPC, 2005). 
 This has incited the use of different types of additives and binders as substitutes 
for cement. Many different formulations have been developed for the S/S process 
mainly based on the type of waste or heavy metals it might include. It has been 
proved that PC can be modiﬁ ed and/or replaced using ﬂ y ash, hydrated lime, steel 
slag, soluble silicates, clay and magnesium oxide (MgO) for suitable S/S process 
(Mayers and Eappi, Laboratory evaluation of stabilization/solidiﬁ cation technology

 An industrial by-product may be used in the cement manufacturing process in 
two different ways. One could be the use of the by-product as the raw material feed 
to the kiln in the manufacture of PC in place of coal. Alternatively, by-products 
could be used together with PC by mixing slag cements or PFA as pozzolans (Gutt, 
Manufacture of cement from industrial by-products, 1971; Tsakiridis et al., J Hazard 
Mater 152:805–811, 2008). Alternative binding agents to cement are discussed in 
detail with the aim of achieving the most sustainable material that could be used in 
the treatment of industrial wastes as binding agents which would allow them to be 
used as construction materials. The S/S treatment is based on binders and waste 
mixtures where the binders used in these systems are most likely alkaline materials 
that reduce the leachability of the metals in a high-pH matrix.  
14.1  Introduction 
 Steel industry is the key element in the industrialisation and economic development of 
a country due to its high input within all manufacturing sectors. Moreover, most build-
ings are structurally made from steel which means that there is a huge need of steel 
products even for construction industry. The global crude steel production is reported 
as 1646 mega tonnes (Mt) for the year 2014 (World Steel Association  2015 ). However, 
steel-making industry is one of the main and biggest  hazardous waste producers in the 
world. Throughout the world, steel foundries are faced with the major problem of 
dealing with the hazardous waste generated from the electric arc furnaces. 
 Hazardous waste and hence its disposal has been problematic issues since indus-
trialisation began. The increasing awareness of the environmental impact arising 
from the disposal of these types of wastes has forced the authorities to make the 
driving legislations more stringent. Recent amendments in the legislations all over 
the world introduced the mandatory treatment of all hazardous wastes prior to their 
disposal in landﬁ ll. Accordingly, all hazardous wastes have to be pretreated before 
landﬁ ll disposal. In addition, the increasing cost of landﬁ ll disposal has incited 
industries, including waste management companies, to ﬁ nd novel alternative options 
to deal with the complexity of hazardous waste disposal. 
 Electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) is generated as an air pollution control (APC) 
residue during the melting of scrap steel in the electric arc furnaces. These dusts are 
extremely ﬁ ne particles formed by the metal vaporisation process in the electric arc 
furnaces and collected in the bag-house dust. EAFD is an industrial waste and is 
classiﬁ ed as hazardous according to the European Waste Catalogue (EWC) under 
the code of 10 02 07*, mainly due to its heavy metal content, i.e. lead (Pb), cadmium 
(Cd), zinc (Zn) and chromium (Cr) (European Union Council  2002 ). The disposal 
of EAFD has been a problematic and costly issue as the amounts produced world-
wide are extremely high. In the electric steel process, the speciﬁ c dust proportion 
per tonne of crude steel is about 10–20 kg, i.e. the mass of dusts produced 
 corresponds to about 1–1.5 % of the mass metal produced in the electric arc furnace 
(Stegemann et al.  2000 ; Menad et al.  2003 ).

 Reduction in the mobility of the waste and hence the leachability of pollutants of 
concern is the main aim of the S/S processes. After pretreatment, S/S products can 
either be disposed of in landﬁ ll or be considered for reuse in the construction indus-
try, depending on the structure and physical and chemical characteristics of the ﬁ nal 
products (Wiles and Barth  1992 ). 
14.2  Solidiﬁ cation/Stabilisation (S/S) Treatment 
of Hazardous Wastes 
 Solidiﬁ cation/stabilisation (S/S) technology is one of the most commonly used treat-
ment technique for the  hazardous wastes  . Therefore, it has been also proposed as a 
treatment method for the wastes that are generated by the steel manufacturing industry. 
During S/S treatment of hazardous waste,  Portland cement type I (hereafter PC) was 
commonly used to effectively solidify and hence encapsulate the toxic content of the 
waste within the solid matrix (Li et al  2001 ). Therefore, there is a need of huge amount 
of cement to be used in this process. However, due to cement’s detrimental impact 
on the environment during its manufacturing process, scientists have been looking 
for alternative materials which may be proposed to replace cement (Gutt,  1971 ; 
Mayers and Eappi,  1992 ; Singh and Garg,  1999 ; Fernandez et al.  2003 ; Middendorf 
et al.  2005 ; Turkel,  2006 ; Tsakiridis et al.  2008 ; Fernandez-Pereira et al.  2009 ; 
Zhang et al.  2011 ). This should be a material which is as cheap and effective as cement. 
 Cement has the ability to gain strength very quickly as soon as it reacts with water. 
Therefore, it is a must that the proposed material should possess similar chemical 
characteristics and be more environmental friendly than cement. Accordingly, it is 
found out that pulverised fuel ash ( PFA ) which is a by-product of coal-ﬁ red power 
stations can replace cement efﬁ ciently as it possesses pozzolanic characteristics which 
allow it to react with cement and gain strength by time. This is a well-known material 
which was proposed as a cement replacement. When it comes to dealing with hazard-
ous wastes with a variety of toxic content, it is important to evaluate the  leaching 
potential of each toxic material contents of the waste. Relying on this important con-
sideration, it is required to test the leaching potential of PFA-blended waste matrices. 
It is clear from the literature that PFA has been successful in the treatment of EAFD 
with effective leaching test results (Poon et al.  1985 ,  2001 ; Fuessle and Taylor  2004 ; 
Atis and Bilim  2007 ; Pereira et al.  2001 ,  2007 ; Fernandez-Pereira et al.  2009 ). 
However, due to some unexpected leaching potential of some toxic content of EAFD, 
it was observed that PFA was not effective in molybdenum leaching. 
 In the meantime, another by-product material  has   been proposed for the S/S treat-
ment of  EAFD which is a hard-burned low-grade magnesium oxide (hereafter 
LGMgO) , obtained from the calcination process of magnesite (Cubukcuoglu and 
Ouki  2012 ). An  LGMgO-blended waste matrix was proposed in order to formulate 
a better option for PFA to assure the immobilisation of all toxic elements  with  leach-
ing potential. Accordingly, the compression strength value of the matrix was reduced, 
but a better toxic encapsulation was achieved. This is due to the high pH range

(9–11) of MgO which controls and minimises the solubility of metal hydroxides. 
Ion exchange between magnesium and other metal cations and possible complex-
ation between contaminants and OH groups on the MgO surface provides the supe-
rior immobilisation capacity to LGMgO (Garcia et al. 2004; Cubukcuoglu and Ouki 
 2012 ; Tresintsi et al.  2013 ; Valle-Zermeno et al.  2015 ; Jin et al.  2015 ). 
 Steel slag is another very commonly used material for the S/S process of heavy 
metals. There are different types of steel slags that are generated as by-products 
from the steel manufacturing industry. They do all have different chemical composi-
tions which bring their own characteristics alongside with them. The chosen steel 
slag is effective in S/S process due to its high MgO content compared to other mate-
rials like PFA and lime (see Table  14.1 ). Steel slag and LGMgO are both by- products 
generated by the industrial processes, and hence they are pertinent binders in this 
particular research. It is therefore important to evaluate their performance as a 
cement replacement binder to potentially improve the sustainability of this tech-
nique for the treatment of this particular waste product in discussion.
 The aim is to produce  solidiﬁ ed  waste products that comply with the landﬁ ll 
waste acceptance criteria ( WAC ) and could have potential for beneﬁ cial reuse. This 
may only be achieved by performing comprehensive and controlled  laboratory- based 
experiments to evaluate the viability of this technique for the remediation of  EAFD 
by implementing the following objectives:

•  Perform a detailed chemical characterisation of the materials and waste products 
used in the study in order to establish the chemical nature and level of the pollut-
ants of concern present in the waste. 
•  Perform a preliminary screening programme in order to select the potential mix 
designs (CEMI: binder, water: solid (w/s) ratios and % of EAFD addition) for 
further detailed investigations.  
•  Evaluate the effects of different binders on the physical characteristics of the 
ﬁ nal solidiﬁ ed products by examining the following relevant parameters: uncon-
ﬁ ned compressive strength (UCS), setting time, bulk density (BD), consistency, 
speciﬁ c gravity and moisture content (MC). Most of these parameters require 
close monitoring if the waste is to be disposed of in a landﬁ ll environment. 
•  Evaluate the leaching characteristics of the untreated and treated waste products 
with respect to the pollutants of concern (Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, Mo and chloride (Cl − )) 
in order to establish a better understanding of the leaching mechanisms involved 
and hence optimise the immobilisation capability of the systems studied. An acid 
neutralisation capacity (ANC) test coupled with granular and monolith leaching 
tests will provide pertinent information regarding the buffering capacity of the 
treated and untreated wastes as well as the long-term leaching behaviour under 
conditions that nearly simulate practice.  
•  Perform extended and advanced microstructural and mineralogical testing on a 
selection of treated and untreated specimens with a view to develop a better 
understanding of the chemical nature of the products formed, the location of the 
pollutants before and after treatment and, consequently, the effectiveness of S/S 
in the immobilisation of the pollutants of concern.   
14.3  Effect of  EAFD Addition on S/S Products Using PC, 
Lime, LGMgO, Steel Slag and PFA 
 Basic characterisation of EAFD has shown that its hazardous properties are due to 
the concentration of Pb (699.1 mg/kg) and Zn (111.4 mg/kg) which exceeded the 
hazardous waste landﬁ ll ( BS EN 12457-3 ) set limits of 50 and 30 mg/kg respec-
tively. The waste sample was found to be toxic for reproduction and ecotoxic. The 
results show that almost all blended mix ratios studied were successful in terms of 
physical integrity including UCS, setting time and consistency tests, but only few 
were capable of stabilising heavy metals. The setting and strength development 
were delayed mainly due to the heavy metal content of the waste. Best physical 
performances were achieved in the following order: CEMI-only > CEMI- 
slag > CEMI-PFA > CEMI-LGMgO. However, most of the slag-blended samples 
achieved higher UCS values than CEMI-only samples at longer curing ages 
(≥28 days). UCS results of potential mix designs at 28 days curing age are shown 
in Fig.  14.1 . A legend has been  prepared  for this UCS data analyses: CEMI-only

 Metal mobility of Pb, Cd and Zn is associated with pH. Low pH values (<7) 
increase the solubility of the metals in question, whereas pH values in the range of 
8–11 decrease the mobility of those metals. Mo usually forms mobile oxy-anions and 
present as MoO 4 2− above pH 5. It is believed that the existence of PbMoO 4 and

CaMoO 4 phases control Mo solubility in the leachate within pH range of 4 and 7. The 
pH values of as-received materials are given in Table  14.2 . Accordingly, it is clear to 
understand that all materials have very alkaline characteristics which lead to the fact 
that any mix combination of these binders with waste will not produce any material 
with a pH value less than 9. XRD and SEM/EDX analysis could not detect any 
CaMoO 4 and PbMoO 4  phases which are required to control Mo leaching. Therefore, 
Mo leaching could be linked to the fact that there was no information of CaMoO 4 and 
PbMoO 4 in the systems. The trend of heavy metal emissions, including Zn, Cd, Cr, 
Mo, Cl and Pb is not linear with  continuous  changes in the sign of the slopes. Very 
few samples had a leaching behaviour that is mainly dominated by diffusion. A very 
high proportion of samples showed a mode  dominated  mostly by depletion.
14.4  Conclusions 
 The results proved that S/S of various hazardous waste exhibits much better product 
performance in terms of granular leaching test regime when compared to the mono-
lithic one. The leaching test results showed that the leaching test according to  EA 
NEN 7375 provides a more conservative scenario than the one presented by the 
standard BS EN 12457-3 for granular waste. The new crystalline compounds 
formed in the stabilisation process included calcite and zincite and appeared in the 
waste samples but were not originally present in the pure cement. The high MgO 
and Fe content of  steel slag resulted in the formation of magnetite and magnesiofer-
rite for CEMI-slag mix matrices. 
 Microstructural analysis revealed that waste solidiﬁ cation is governed by the for-
mation of crystalline calcium zincate hydrate CaZn 2 (OH) 6 ⋅2H 2 O by reaction of ZnO 
with the cement hydration product portlandite (Ca(OH) 2 ). SEM analysis is able to 
detect the formation of cement hydration products (portlandite and ettringite) and 
the effect of heavy metals, including Zn, Mo, Cd and Cr, on the formation of C–H 
and/or C–S–H cement hydration products. The SEM/EDX results demonstrate the 
existence of zinc in EAFD waste with Pb, Cd and Cr bearing phases being very 
small to be detected. Anhydrite (CaSO 4 ) and anglesite (PbSO 4 ) are considered as 
the main mineralogical phases of the leaching residue; however, these were not 
detected in either the SEM/EDX or XRD analysis of this study. 
 Both LGMgO and steel slag may replace cement up to 70 % including waste at a 
range of 40–70 %. These ratios may be suggested as the optimum mix designs that 
are successful in the S/S of EAFD and satisﬁ ed all the WAC requirements. Therefore, 
effective replacement of cement by LGMgO and  steel slag (both waste by-products) 
at a ratio of (20:80) signiﬁ cantly improves both the economics and sustainability 
characteristics of this treatment technique.

Dangerous Emissions During Steelmaking 
in Electric Arc Furnaces
Dana-Adriana Iluţiu-Varvara
Abstract  The steelmaking in the electric arc furnaces (EAFs) is in the category of 
industrial processes with high degree of pollution. In the air environmental factors 
are transferred the following dangerous substances: carbon oxides, sulphur diox-
ide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans and particulate matter. This chapter presents the 
categories of dangerous emissions generated from the steelmaking in the EAFs; 
potential sources that generate the dangerous emissions from the steelmaking in 
the EAFs; generation mechanisms of dangerous emissions from the steelmaking 
in the EAFs; methods of minimizing the dangerous emissions from the steelmak-
ing in the EAFs.
15.1  Categories of Dangerous Emissions Generated 
from the Steelmaking in the Electric Arc Furnaces
In order to identify the categories of dangerous emissions generated from the 
­electric arc furnaces (EAFs), one must know the inputs of the steelmaking ­process. 
In Fig. 15.1 are presented the inputs and outputs from the steelmaking in the EAFs.
The categories of dangerous emissions generated from the steelmaking in the 
EAFs are carbon oxides (COx), sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), vola-
tile organic compounds (VOCs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), poly-
chlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and particulate matter (PM).

15.1.1  What Are Dangerous Emissions?
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odourless, tasteless and colourless gas produced by 
the incomplete burning of materials which contain carbon. It combines with haemo-
globin to form carboxyhaemoglobin, resulting in hypoxia with serious conse-
quences for various tissues and cell respiration, which is manifested clinically by 
headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and arrhythmias. It also transformed into 
carbon dioxide (CO2, which is also directly emitted when fuels are being burnt. 
Carbon dioxide is the most anthropogenic greenhouse gas emitted through human 
activities and has no direct adverse health effects. One of the anthropogenic activi-
ties which emitted carbon oxides is the steelmaking in the EAF (Iluţiu-Varvara 
2010; Iluţiu-Varvara et al. 2015a, b).
Sulphur oxides (SOx) refer to all sulphur oxides, ones being sulphur dioxide 
(SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Sulphur dioxide is a colourless gas with a pungent, 
irritating odour and taste. It is highly soluble in water forming weakly acidic sulphu-
rous acid. When sulphur dioxide combines with the oxygen in the air some sulphur 
trioxide is slowly formed. Sulphur trioxide rapidly combines with water to produce 
sulphuric acid (Iluţiu-Varvara et al. 2011, 2013; Iluţiu-Varvara and Rădulescu 2013).

Nitrogen oxides include nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), nitrogen trioxide (NO3), dinitrogen trioxide (N2O3), dinitrogen 
tetroxide (N2O4) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) (Greenwood and Earnshaw 1997). 
Nitrogen oxides are in the category of most polluting substances emitted into the 
environment. The nitrogen dioxide is the second most producing greenhouse effect 
(Negrea and Sandu 2000).
VOCs, as defined in Directive 2010/75 (European Union Directive 2010/75/EU, 
Drotloff 2014), are organic compounds having at 293.15 K a vapour pressure of 
0.01 kPa or more, or having a corresponding volatility under the particular condi-
tions of use. Due to their characteristics, the use of VOC solvents in certain installa-
tions generates emissions of organic compounds that contribute directly to air 
pollution and climate change and are also ozone precursors, i.e. they react chemi-
cally with nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight to form ozone. While ozone is 
beneficial in the upper atmosphere, where it shields the earth from dangerous UV 
rays, it can be harmful when present in high concentrations at ground level. 
According to Directive (European Community Directive 1999/13/EC), an organic 
compound is defined as any compound containing at least the element carbon and 
one or more of hydrogen, halogens (e.g. chlorine, fluorine or bromine), oxygen, 
sulphur, phosphorus, silicon or nitrogen, with the exception of carbon oxides and 
inorganic carbonates and bicarbonates. An even wider definition is used in the EU 
National Emissions Ceilings Directive (Directive 2001/81/EC), where a VOC is any 
organic compound of anthropogenic nature, other than methane, that is capable of 
producing photochemical oxidants by reaction with nitrogen oxides in the presence 
of sunlight (Iluţiu-Varvara et al. 2016).
PCDDs and PCDFs are types of persistent organic pollutants with a wide range 
of toxic responses and carcinogenic properties. These pollutants can be considered 
as environmental quality indicators of anthropogenic activities. One of the most 
important anthropogenic sources of PCDDs and PCDFs from the ferrous metals 
industry includes steelmaking in the EAFs (Iluţiu-Varvara 2016; Varvara 2006a; 
Anderson and Fisher 2002; Chang et al. 2006; Grochowalski et al. 2007; Sofilic 
et al. 2012). The generation of these compounds requires carbon, oxygen and chlo-
rine, as well as metallic catalysts and adequate temperature. The optimal tempera-
ture range for pyrosynthesis of these compounds is between 400 and 700 °C (Van 
den Berg et al. 2006).
In order to achieve a higher level of uniformity and comparability of results 
defining PCDDs and PCDFs content in samples of different materials of different 
origin, there was adopted the International Toxicity Equivalent Factor (I-TEF). 
Nowadays, the analysis of PCDDs/Fs in various samples commonly includes 17 
compounds (7 PCDDs and 10 PCDFs) and their level in the sample is described as 
toxic equivalent (I-TEQ) in correlation with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-­
dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). In Table 15.1 is presented the I-TEF reported in various 
references from specialized literature.
Particulate matters (PM) refer to a suspension of solid, liquid or a combination 
of solid and liquid particles in the air. Air pollution originating from PM is generally 
characterized by its highly complex nature. Particulate matters are a mixture of 
15  Dangerous Emissions During Steelmaking in Electric Arc Furnaces

250
particles and droplets in the air, consisting of a variety of components such as 
organic compounds, metals, acids, soil and dust. These suspended particles vary in 
size, composition and origin. Particles are often classified by their aerodynamic 
properties because (Rai 2015) these properties govern the transport and removal of 
particles from the air; they also govern their deposition within the respiratory ­system 
and they are associated with the chemical composition and sources of particles.
PM10 (the fraction of particulates in air of very small size (<10 μm)) and PM2.5 
particles (<2.5  μm) are of major current concern, as they are small enough to

particles, meanwhile, are not readily inhaled and are removed relatively efficiently 
from the air by sedimentation.
15.2  Potential Sources That Generate the Dangerous 
Emissions from the Steelmaking in the Electric Arc 
Furnaces
15.2.1  Potential Sources That Generate Carbon Oxides
The sources with carbon oxides generating potential to the steelmaking are (Varvara 
2007a; Iluţiu-Varvara 2007a) the carbon from the charge; scrap iron; first fusion pig 
iron; fuel material and the carbon from the graphite electrodes, which are gradually 
consumed, until destruction.
15.2.2  Potential Sources That Generate Sulphur Oxides
The sources with sulphur dioxide generating potential in the electric arc steelmak-
ing are (Varvara 2006b, 2007a) the metallic charge; additions of auxiliary materials; 
first fusion pig iron (0.05–0.07 % S) and EAF atmosphere, when using fuels con-
taining sulphur.
The sulphur may derive from some impurities of the charge and from the elec-
trodes. The sulphur from the charge in the form of metal sulphides <MeS> can 
undergo the reaction:

15.2.3  Potential Sources That Generate Nitrogen Oxides
The EAF atmosphere is source that generates nitrogen oxides because it contains 
gases, like as oxygen and nitrogen, at high temperatures (~1800 °C). The fuels used 
in steelmaking and some oils introduced with the charge contain nitrogen. During 
combustion processes, the fuels are oxidized and a substantial fraction of them con-
tain nitrogen, which is oxidized, thus forming (NOx).
15  Dangerous Emissions During Steelmaking in Electric Arc Furnaces

252
15.2.4  Potential Sources That Generate Volatile Organic 
Compounds
The potential sources that generate the VOCs from the steelmaking are organic mat-
ters, paints and plastics from the charge (Iluţiu-Varvara 2007a, 2009c; Iluţiu-Varvara 
et  al. 2016). Sources of VOCs from EAFs include (Environmental Agency of 
London 1999) scrap preparation with solvent degreasers; combusting auxiliary fuel; 
hydrocarbons contained in the oils, wire casing, foam and plastics found in the steel 
scrap feedstock can vapourize when melting takes place; decarburization of scrap; 
charging of the furnace and tapping of the molten metal and slag.
15.2.5  Potential Sources That Generate Polychlorinated 
Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans
Scrap metal can be contaminated with paint, organic matter (oil and cutting fluids) 
and plastic (polyvinyl chloride). Organic and inorganic forms of chlorine may also 
be present. Scrap may be thermally pre-treated to remove contamination by burn-
ing, drying to evaporate water, or by partial pyrolysis. Burning and pyrolysis of 
contaminated scrap give rise to products of incomplete combustion such as particu-
late matter, carbon monoxide, organic compounds and may emit dioxins and furans 
(Iluţiu-Varvara 2016; Cavaliere and Perrone 2015).
15.2.6  Potential Sources That Generate Particulate Matter
The potential sources that generate the particulate matter in the steelmaking are 
(Iluţiu-Varvara 2007b; Varvara 2007b; Li and Tsai 1993) the charge components of 
the EAF; the physico-chemical interaction of the charge components; the furnace 
lining (acid or alkaline); melting method used and the possibility of metal oxides 
volatilization and other slag components in the gas phase above the EAFs.
The emission sources of particulate matter containing (Iluţiu-Varvara 2007a):
• zinc are dip galvanized and auto industry wastes;
• lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel are the presence in charge of the nickel 
plating surfaces, cadmium plating surfaces, chromate surfaces, brassed surfaces, 
paints and auto industry wastes;
• sodium, potassium and chlorine are associated with the auto industry wastes; the 
chlorine can originate from oils, organic materials and plastics;
• calcium is lime (CaO);
• fluorine is calcium fluoride (CaF2), used as fondant;
• silicon is lining of the EAF.

15.3.1  The Generation Mechanisms of Carbon Oxides
The carbon oxidation in the metal bath can be performed by direct reaction with 
oxygen and through the iron oxide. The chemical reactions that lead to the genera-
tion of carbon oxides (COx) from the steelmaking in EAFs are (Varvara 2007a;

Sulphur can be usually found in the iron ore in the form of pyrite (FeS2) or pirotin

15.3.3  The Generation Mechanisms of Nitrogen Oxides
Nitrogen oxides emissions are due to the oxidation of nitrogen at high temperature. 
The highest temperatures during steelmaking in EAF are in the arc area and in the 
oxygen blowing area. So, the best conditions for the generation of (NOx) are par-
ticularly in the electric arc area (Iluţiu-Varvara 2009a, b).
D.-A.Iluţiu-Varvara

255
The mechanisms after which the generation of nitrogen oxides may occur are 
(Zeldovich et  al. 1947, 1985) thermal mechanism; prompt mechanism and fuel 
mechanism.
In the case of the thermal mechanism, the nitrogen oxides formed are a conse-
quence of not only the oxidation of the nitrogen from the fuels composition, but also 
the oxidation of the nitrogen from its dissociation.
The dissociation reaction is

The adsorbed nitrogen atoms are dissolved in the slag and metal bath. In contact 
with the oxygen at temperatures above 1800 K, the nitrogen monoxide is formed. 
The oxidation reactions may be with the molecular nitrogen or with the nitrogen in 
atomic state (resulting from dissociation).

It results that the nitrogen monoxide can be formed by direct combination at high 
temperature (>1000 °C) of the oxygen with the nitrogen from the EAF atmosphere.

The prompt formation mechanism of nitrogen oxides refers to the formation in 
the arc area, which is also a thermal mechanism. This mechanism is more complex 
and controlled by the formation of CH radicals. The CH radicals react with nitrogen 
to HCN, which then react in several steps to nitrogen oxides according to the reac-
tion (Echterhof et al. 2011):

The prompt NOx is dependent on the concentration of CH radicals, which in turn 
is strongly controlled by local fuel concentration.
The fuel mechanism of nitrogen oxides formation refers to the direct formation from 
the fuels used. In this case, the nitrogen oxides are generated by the oxidation of fossil 
fuel (coal and heavy oil) bound nitrogen. The specific reaction of this mechanism is

The predominant generation mechanism of nitrogen oxides at high temperatures 
is the thermal type.
Nitrogen monoxide (NO) is generated because of the atmospheric nitrogen oxi-
dation (thermal NO by dissociation at high temperature and via the reaction of nitro-
gen radicals and hydrocarbons) or due to the oxidation of the nitrogen compounds 
contained in fossil fuels (fuel NO). As fuel gas in the steel industry does not contain 
chemically bounded nitrogen, the thermal NO formation is the dominant source of 
NOx from the EAF. Thermal NO occurs by dissociation of the air in the electric arc 
in accordance with the Zeldovich mechanism (Capitelli et al. 2000; Warnatz et al. 
1999; Malikov et al. 2002).
15.3.4  The Generation Mechanisms of Volatile Organic 
Compounds
VOCs are generated in the EAFs from combustion of auxiliary fuel, oil contained in 
the scrap and decarburization of the scrap (Unamuno et al. 2008).
VOCs emissions may result from organic substances adhering to the raw materi-
als (solvents, paints) charged to the furnace. In the case of the use of natural coal 
(anthracite), compounds such as benzene may degas before being burnt off (Eurofer 
2007).
15.3.5  The Generation Mechanisms of Polychlorinated 
Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Polychlorinated Dibenzofurans
The generation of these compounds requires carbon, oxygen and chlorine, as well 
as metallic catalysts and adequate temperature. The optimal temperature range for 
pyrosynthesis of these compounds is between 400 and 700 °C (Sofilic et al. 2012).
By thermal processes the compounds may be formed by two mechanisms:
• “de novo synthesis”; dioxins and furans are formed from its basic elements—
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and chlorine. The process is taking place at tempera-
tures between approximately 250 and 500 °C on catalytically active surfaces. In 
particular copper compounds are regarded as effective catalysts.
–– formation from precursors; dioxins and furans are formed from chlorinated 
organic compounds, such as chlorinated phenols that serve as precursors for 
the process. Similarly, these reactions may take place at temperatures between 
approximately 200 and 500 °C on catalytically active surfaces, but also spon-
taneously at the relevant temperatures.
D.-A.Iluţiu-Varvara

257
Whereas dioxins are likely to be decomposed at very high temperatures (above 
800–1000 °C) assuming adequate residence time at this temperature level, forma-
tion of dioxins may take place again at lower temperatures in the flue gas or on 
active surfaces by “de novo synthesis”. This sets the focus on all kinds of high tem-
perature processes. The source of chlorine could be the material itself, or it could be 
the fuel (Tysklind et al. 1989).
Molecular chlorine is thought to be responsible for the formation of “de novo 
synthesis” of dioxins, according to the following reactions:

Dioxins tend to form both at low and high temperatures. At temperatures between 
200 and 400 °C, in combustion gas exhaust streams, highly chlorinated dibenzo-­p-­
dioxin and dibenzofuran are formed from phenol and benzene prior to particle col-
lection equipment. Chlorination at lower temperatures on particle surfaces is a 
potential source of chlorinated dibenzofuran (Ryu et al. 2003). At high tempera-
tures, between 500 and 800 °C, mainly the less chlorinated dibenzofuran congeners 
are formed. The chlorination can occur on metals, in particular, copper (II) chloride 
(CuCl2) by the Deacon reaction. Hydrogen chloride is converted catalytically to Cl2, 
which then can lead to gas-phase DF chlorination (Wikstrom and Marklund 2000):

For all thermal processes the presence of precursors may be anticipated to 
increase the probability of dioxin formation and may reduce the need for catalyti-
cally active surfaces.
In Table  15.2 there are shown the percentage concentrations of PCDDs and 
PCDFs in the stack flue gases from steelmaking in the EAF (Iluţiu-Varvara 2016).
15  Dangerous Emissions During Steelmaking in Electric Arc Furnaces

258
The variations of dioxin and furan emissions from the steelmaking in the EAF 
are dependent on the quality of the scrap used; degree of contamination with chlo-
rine compounds of the charge components; conditioning and gas cleaning systems 
and efficiency collection of particulate matter.
15.3.6  The Generation Mechanisms and Compositions 
of Particulate Matters
The particulate matters from steelmaking in the EAF are the end product of a series 
of phenomena such as the
• transfer of the particles from the metal bath and slag;
• transfer of the particles together with gases emitted;
• physical (changes phase, agglomeration) and chemical transformations (reac-
tions between the phases and with the gaseous phase) during the process 
capture.
The generation mechanism of particulate matter takes place in two steps 
(Guézennec et al. 2005):
• the emissions of the particulate matter “precursors” (vapours, metal droplets and 
solid particles) inside the furnace;
• the precursors conversion into particulate matter by agglomeration and physico-­
chemical transformation.
The emission mechanisms of the particulate matter “precursors” are
• the volatilization of the elements from the charge composition (Zn, Pb, Cd, etc.) 
prevails mostly in the electric arc area and the oxygen jet zone;
• the emission of the droplets from metal bath, at the impact of electric arc with 
oxygen jet;
• projection of fine droplets by bursting of CO bubbles during the decarburization 
of the metal bath;
• the expulsion of metal and slag droplets in contact with oxidizing atmosphere of 
the furnace;
• direct removal of solid particles, during the introduction of powdered material 
into the furnace (scrap, coal for slag foaming, additive materials and recycled 
dusts);

• entrainment of the large slag droplets;
• entrainment of the solid materials.
The “precursors” are further transformed during their transport within the fur-
nace and then in the fume extraction system. They can undergo
• physical transformations: condensation of the vapours, rapid solidification of the 
fine projections in contact with a colder atmosphere, in-flight agglomeration and 
coalescence of dust particles.
• chemical reactions (oxidation) with the carrier gas, whose temperature and com-
position vary and they can possibly react with other precursor particles. For a 
reaction between condensed phases (liquid or solid) to occur, particles must first 
be brought into contact. Therefore, there is a strong link between the mecha-
nisms of agglomeration and the chemical evolution (Huber 2000).
The projection of liquid steel and slag droplets by bursting of carbon monoxide 
bubbles has been recognized as the principal mechanism of particulate matter emis-
sions from the steelmaking in the EAF (Han and Holappa 2003).
The chemical compositions of the particulate matter from steelmaking in the 
EAFs vary considerably depending on the steel type produced, raw materials used, 
auxiliary materials used, operational parameters, melting methods used and furnace 
type and heats (Varvara 2007b).

Compared to carbon steel plant dust, stainless steel plant dust has a low zinc 
concentration, but is enriched in metallic components since high alloy scrap is used 
in the production of stainless steel.
Stainless steel dust consists mainly of oxide phases that are rich in iron, chro-
mium, calcium, zinc, magnesium, manganese and nickel, with minor amounts of 
phases that contain alkaline metals (potassium and sodium), halogens (chlorine and 
fluorine), silicon, molybdenum, lead and sulphur. Chromium and iron oxides (CrO 
and Fe2O3) as well as spinel phases (such as FeCr2O4, (Mg, Fe, Mn, Cr)3O4, MnFe2O4 
and ZnFe2O4), and some raw materials (CaO, CaF2 and CaCO3) are the major crys-
talline phases present in the particulate matter from stainless steel. Minor phases 
include pure metallic particles (iron, zinc and nickel), oxide phases (NiO, MgO, 
PbO, SiO2 and ZnO), halogens (PbCl2, ZnCl2, KCl and NaCl), SiC, fayalite 
(Fe2SiO4), sulphates and hydrates (ZnCl2 · 4Zn(OH)2, Ca(OH)2) (Ma and Garbers-­
Craig 2006; Iluţiu-Varvara 2007b; Varvara 2007b).
Particulate matters from the EAF are formed mainly from (Iluţiu-Varvara 2007a) 
metallic oxides; refractory oxides and volatile elements from the charge.
In Table 15.3, there are presented the minimum and maximum concentrations of 
the elements in the EAF particulate matters (USEPA 1988). The gathering of the 
particulate matters from EAFs is performed with baghouses or scrubbers. The par-
ticulate matters from EAF are in the category of hazardous waste.
15.4  Methods of Minimizing the Dangerous Emissions 
from the Steelmaking in the Electric Arc Furnaces
The minimizing of carbon oxides emissions from the steelmaking in the EAFs is 
possible by (Varvara 2007a; Iluţiu-Varvara 2007b, 2010; Lotun and Pilon 2005) the 
charge component selection; the use of raw materials with reduced carbon content 
and using “foaming slag” technology.
The foaming slag can be obtained at the end of fusion of ferrous materials before 
the disappearance of the last melt by simultaneously injecting through the cleaning 
door of the coal in the slag; oxygen at the surface or inside the metal.
The foaming slag is not stable, once formed, is degrading, as a consequence the 
coal must be continuously injected. This technology has the following effects: 
decreasing the air flow rate entering the furnace, which results in lower emissions of 
carbon oxides; decreasing the melting stage duration and decreasing the graphite 
electrodes consumption.
D.-A.Iluţiu-Varvara

261
The pollution prevention and control techniques to reduce the air pollution with 
sulphur oxides (SOx) from the steelmaking include the following: the selection 
feedstocks and scrap with low sulphur content; the usage of fuel with low sulphur 
content, such as natural gas; the usage of wet scrubbing systems before dry scrub-
bers as part of collecting and dedusting system and emissions control technologies 
such as sorbent injection and flue gas desulphurization (methods may include wet 
or dry processes) (Iluţiu-Varvara et al. 2013; Iluţiu-Varvara and Rădulescu 2013).
The reduction of NOx emissions from steelmaking is possible through general 
ventilation of the electric steel mill, encapsulation of the EAF and exhaust systems 
(Iluţiu-Varvara 2009a, b).
The reduction of pollution with VOCs from the steelmaking in the EAFs is pos-
sible by charge component selection (scrap should be free of dirt, oil and grease); 
the use of raw materials without organic compounds and scrap management pro-
gram for the prevention/minimization of potential contaminants in the steel scrap 
(Iluţiu-Varvara et al. 2016).
The reduction of pollution with dioxins and furans from the steelmaking in the 
EAF is possible by charge component selection and by the use of raw materials with 
reduced plastics content (Iluţiu-Varvara 2016).
Baghouses and cyclones can be used to control particulate matter emissions. 
There are two possibilities to manage these EAF dusts: hydrometallurgical and 
pyrometallurgical processes. They consisted in the extraction of nonferrous metals, 
i.e. zinc, in order to recycle the residue in the steelmaking industry; however, the 
hydrometallurgical processes are regarded as more eco-friendly for treating materi-
als having a relatively low zinc content. A third option that can be considered for 
these dusts is their inactivation, i.e. their stabilization prior to permanent disposal 
(Jha et al. 2001; Varvara 2006b).

15  Dangerous Emissions During Steelmaking in Electric Arc Furnaces

15.5  Conclusions
The dangerous emissions generated from the steelmaking in the EAFs are carbon 
oxides (COx); sulphur oxides (SOx); nitrogen oxides (NOx); VOCs; PCDDs; PCDFs; 
particulate matter (PM).
The generation sources of emissions with dangerous potential in the electric arc 
steelmaking are the charge components of the EAF; the physico-chemical interac-
tion of the charge components; the furnace lining (acid or alkaline); melting method 
used; the possibility of metal oxides volatilization and the contamination degree of 
the charge components.
Because of the extremely high toxic potential of dioxins and furans, it is very 
important to keep dioxin emission at a minimum by focusing on additional mea-
sures aimed at reducing human exposure to high levels of dioxins in the short to 
medium term and to maintaining exposure at safe levels in the long term. 
Additionally, measures should be taken in order to minimize the levels of dioxins 
and furans precursors from the steelmaking in the EAF.
The conditions for the generation of dioxins and furans from the steelmaking in 
the EAF are the presence in the charge of chlorine or fluorine ions; the presence of 
organic carbon; temperature between 200 and 450 °C; oxidizing atmosphere and the 
presence of copper, iron, zinc or manganese ions.
The emissions generated from the steelmaking in the EAF have a negative 
impact on the human health and the environment.
The reduction of dangerous emissions to the steelmaking is possible by charge 
component selection and by the use of raw materials without impurities.

Abstract  In this chapter, electric steelmaking is introduced with a short review: 
share, raw materials, operation, typical equipment, off-gas treatment, emissions. 
Electric-based steelmaking enjoys a much comfortable position than integrated 
classical blast furnace—oxygen steelmaking facilities, regarding greenhouse emis-
sions. This is compared both for regions and for the world. For instance, the mostly 
EAF-based NAFTA countries are nowadays the region where the production of steel 
generates lower specific emissions. This said (and detailed), the chapter continues 
with a discussion of the CO2 emissions of the electric arc furnaces. A reference is be 
made to the use of alternative raw materials, as DRI/HBI, pig iron and hot metal. In 
relation with the EAF design, factors to be analyzed are the effects of different fur-
nace designs on emissions: conventional, twin shell, conveyor scrap preheating, and 
shaft scrap preheating are considered. The use of chemical energy is reviewed, as 
well as the effect of an external factor: how electric energy is generated.
16.1  Electric Steelmaking
The electric arc furnace applied in steelmaking was invented in 1889 by Paul 
Héroult. Emerging new technology started in the beginning of the twentieth century 
when wide-ranging generation of relatively cheap electric energy started at that 
time. First-generation furnaces had a capacity in between 1 and 15 t. The EAF had 
Bessemer/Thomas converters and Siemens Martin furnaces as strong competitors, 
initially. But its niche was the production of special steels requiring high tempera-
ture, ferroalloy melting, and long refining times. In the 1960s, with the advent of 
billet casting, the EAF occupied a new niche: the melting unit of choice for the so-­
called minimills, feeding billet casters for the production of rebar and wire rod 
(Madias 2014).

In the following two decades, to better support the short tap-to-tap time required 
by billet casters, the EAF reinvented itself as a melting-only unit. Steel refining was 
left for the recently introduced ladle furnace. Large transformers were introduced; 
ultrahigh-power furnaces developed, which were made possible by adopting 
­foaming slag practice. This way, tap-to-tap time became close to casting time.
By 1985, a new niche for electric steelmaking began to be taken: flat products, 
through thin slab casting, and direct rolling.
This process route has achieved a significant role in world steel production, 
being close to 26 % share by 2014 (Fig. 16.1). The three top producers are the 
United States, India, and China (Table 16.1).

Most of the ferrous scrap worldwide is recycled and refined to steels via electric 
furnaces. EAFs are versatile, charging everything from all sorts of scrap to hot bri-
quetted iron (HBI), direct reduced iron (DRI), pig iron, hot metal (Table 16.2).
EAFs may produce all type of steels: long and flat, carbon and alloyed, merchant 
and special products.
The developments in the EAF technologies since 1965, promoting lower electric 
energy consumption, shorter tap-to-tap time, and less electrode consumption, are 
shown in Fig. 16.2 (Lüngen et al. 2013). Furnace size enlarged up to 350 t maxi-
mum, which together with the shortening of tap-to-tap time made possible to have 
more than 1  Mtpy capacity with just one furnace. Electric energy consumption

decreased down to 350  kWh/t for 100 % scrap operations. Chemical energy 
increased at levels not far from those of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOFs). Refractory 
consumption fell down due to the replacement by cooled roof and panels, slag 
foaming, and refractory quality improvement. Power-off time is now of <10 min for 
the best operated furnaces. For a large number of ArcelorMittal group meltshops, 
average electrode consumption was 1.43 kg/t.
16.1.1  Equipment
The increase in furnace electric power has been the key factor in the development of 
EAF technology during the past 50 years. As in the 1960s, a common EAF power 
was 250–300 kVA/t liquid steel; today standard ultra-high-power EAFs have 900–
1000 kVA/t steel available in the transformers. These furnaces are equipped with 
water-cooled panels and EBT tapping. EBT stands for eccentric bottom tapping, a 
tapping system that yields a uniform steel jet falling into the ladle, with slag carry 
over controlled to a certain extent. In Fig. 16.3, a scheme of such state-of-the-art 
EAF is presented.
The current furnace includes three water-cooled parts: roof, panels, and off-
gas duct. Although some heat is lost due to the heat extraction by the cooling

water, this design makes possible less refractory consumption (because they 
replace refractory linings) and the use of high power. At the time the panels were 
first introduced, some fears arose on safety risks, but after realizing the cost 
advantage, almost all EAF adopted them. They may be made of steel or copper 
(much longer life) and with different designs (conventional, flip and turn, etc.). 
Recently, more attention has been paid to safety with water cooling. First, to 
detect, limit, and avoid the possibility of water leakage, and second, to cut the 
need of repairing work in the hot furnace. Off-gas analysis, when hydrogen is 
included, is a useful tool to detect leakage. To limit leakage and maintenance 
work, solid cast or machined water panes have been introduced. Split shell, with 
spray-cooled upper shell means less risk as non-pressurized water tends to pene-
trate less in case of leakage.
There are variations on the standard design:
–– Use of direct current instead of alternative current, with one large electrodes  
(or two) instead of three, and a refrigerated anode in the hearth bottom. Main aim 
is to decrease electrode consumption and flickers.
–– Use of scrap preheating on a continuous scrap transporter, using the off-gas heat, 
in counter-current. Main aim is to decrease energy consumption and to avoid 
bucket charging.
–– Use of scrap preheating in a shaft, using the off-gas heat. Main aim: to decrease 
energy consumption.
–– Twin shell.
16.1.2  Melting Practice
The basic principle of electric steelmaking today is that the furnace is a “melting 
machine” that produces liquid steel with required chemistry, temperature, and mass 
in time to feed steel to successive ladle treatments and continuous caster, which 
finally determines the production rhythm. Typical tap-to-tap times are in the range 
of 40–60 min, which is also the total furnace time per heat.
Although Ultra High Power (UHP) furnaces are used, fast melting by using only 
electric power is difficult and not the most economic practice either. Importing extra 
energy and assisting melting technique can greatly accelerate scrap melting and 
bring economic benefits. Accordingly, the current state of the art in EAF steelmak-
ing is to use as much as possible chemical energy, besides electric energy, to accom-
modate tap-to-tap times to the pace of the downstream continuous caster.
Regarding the application of electric energy, at the start of melting, after basket 
charge, not all the available power can be applied, as the electrodes may be still in a 
high position, too close to the roof. Then, when the melting operation has advanced 
further, changing to the tap maximum power may be applied. This is not the case for 
100 % flat bath operations like in Consteel EAFs or 100 % DRI/HBI charging 
through the fifth hole. Chemical energy is introduced by oxygen, carbonaceous

The refining step usually does not require full power, which with already flat bath 
could be dangerous for the lining. At that time, the foaming of the slag is a must. 
For the slag to foam, the production of CO gas is necessary, by means of the injec-
tion of carbon and oxygen through lances or burners. For foaming purposes, several 
carbonaceous materials are useful, depending on local cost and availability: anthra-
cite, petroleum coke, coke breeze.
16.2  EAF CO2 Emissions
There is a specific methodology to calculate GHG emissions from EAF steel 
facilities (Climate leaders 2003). It includes calculating emissions from carbon-
ate flux and use of carbon electrodes. Emissions of CO2 from use of carbonate 
flux are calculated based on the amount of flux used and the stoichiometric ratio 
of CO2 to CaCO3 and MgCO3. The emissions from use of electrodes are estimated 
based on the number of electrodes used and the carbon content of the electrodes. 
CO2 emissions from any coke or coal used in the process are estimated using the 
Climate Leaders Stationary Combustion guidance. The steps involved with esti-
mating iron and steel process related CO2 emissions from EAF facilities are 
shown below.
Step 1: Determine the amount of carbonate flux used. This should be in terms of 
pure CaCO3 and MgCO3. Therefore, the total amount of flux used needs to be 
adjusted for purity.
Step 2: Calculate the flux carbon factor. This is based on the stoichiometric ratio of C 
to CaCO3 and MgCO3. Default values are given in Climate Leaders 2003, Sect. 3.2.
Step 3: Determine the amount of electrodes used. This could be based on the actual 
amounts used or could be estimated based on the amount of steel produced.
Step 4: Determine the electrode carbon factor. This is based on the carbon content 
of the electrode
Equation 16.1 represents the method used to calculate CO2 emissions from steel 
production at EAF facilities. More explanation of emission factors and default val-
ues is provided in Sect. 16.3 of the reference.

If the CO2 emissions related to the production of electric energy are considered, the 
source of this energy has a very strong influence. A case study has been carried out 
for a conventional EAF in Canada and an EAF equipped with shaft preheater in the 
UK (Thomson et al. 2000). Both countries have a different profile of electricity 
sources (see Table 16.3). In Fig. 16.4 the share of GHG emissions (including the 
generation of electricity) is shown for the two cases.
It is well known that emissions from EAF-based steelmaking are much lower 
than for integrated plants. Electric steelmaking represented in 2013 29 % of the 
world steel production, but only 1 % of the energy consumption and just 12 % of 
CO2 emissions (see Fig. 16.5).
Worldwide figures have been collected by Worldsteel in 2013 from 72 BF/BOF 
mills and EAF plants, to benchmark emissions. Results are presented in Fig. 16.6. 
In weighted average, for BF/BOF plants CO2 intensity is 2.26 t CO2/t crude steel, 
while for EAF plants the figure is 0.62 t CO2/t crude steel (Reimink 2015).
In Table 16.4, a comparison is made for the case of the USA, where the dominant 
process route is electric steelmaking.
Thanks to its higher share of EAF, NAFTA (Mexico, USA, Canada) has the 
lower specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions in comparison with other 
OECD countries (Europe 27 + TK and Australasia), see Fig. 16.7.
Recycling scrap in EAFs is the most efficient available technology, not just for 
energy. Steel, like all metals, is indefinitely recyclable without loss of properties. 
Steel is not “consumed” but “used,” over and over again. The energy needed to

melt scrap represents 40 % of the energy and 30 % of CO2 to smelt iron ore in a 
modern BF/BOF integrated mill. In addition, capital cost per ton of capacity is 
60–70 % lower; maintenance costs are decreased in the same proportion. Labor 
productivity is twice as high and smaller size of mill usually leads to better social 
relationship.
16.3  Technologies to Decrease EAF CO2 Emissions
In Europe, some technologies are being considered as Best Available Technology to 
decrease energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In Table  16.5 those BAT are 
listed, taking into account if they are add-on, process control, or new technology 
(Pardo et al. 2012). Those selected as the most promising are scrap preheating and 
oxy-fuel burners.
In the USA, several technologies have been identified to decrease energy con-
sumption and in consequence CO2 emissions in EAFs (EPA Office of Air and 
Radiation 2012), see Table 16.6.
In the following, a short discussion of the two more promising technologies men-
tioned above is carried out.
Scrap Preheating  Some 20 % of all the energy input for melting the scrap in an 
EAF disappears in the form of waste gas. Preheating of scrap is a technology that 
can reduce the power consumption in the EAF process by using the waste heat of 
the furnace to preheat the incoming scrap charge. There are 99 Scrap Preheating 
systems currently installed in the EU. In the case of adoption of this technology, 
total and direct CO2 emissions should decrease by 0.037 t CO2/t crude steel.

Basically, there are three ways of preheating the scrap that are being used cur-
rently: in a conveyor, using continuous charging (Consteel EAF), or in a shaft, with 
batch charging.
In the Consteel EAFs, preheating is carried out continuously with the off-gas 
exiting the furnace over a conveyor feeding the scrap to the EAF (Fig. 16.8). The 
upper part of the scrap enters the furnace hotter than the lower part, which is not so 
much exposed to the heat. Most advantages of the furnace type come from the full 
flat-bath operation, although energy recovery through preheating is even significant. 
A current trend in these furnaces is to have a large hot heel, even 50 % of the heat 
weight, thus favoring heat transfer from liquid to solid steel, as long as there is bot-
tom stirring. Here the mechanism of radiation from the electrodes to the scrap 
around the electrodes does not exist. More than 40 Consteel EAFs have been built 
and more than 30 are in operation, with some more under construction. The empha-
sis in the first decade of this century has been more on high productivity, large EAFs 
installed in Asia, rather than in the energy recovery feature. Here there is potential 
for more efficiency (Jones et al. 1998).
As previously mentioned, continuous charging lets us use maximum power from 
the start of the heat, as a difference with batch charging, where lower tap is applied 
after charging of each bucket to avoid damage to the roof. Obviously, power-off 
time for bucket charging is avoided. Recently, the Consteel Evolution concept has 
been proposed, including natural gas burners for charge preheating before entering 
the off-gas preheated tunnel, and off-gas analysis to improve post-combustion in the 
tunnel (Memmoli et al. 2012).
Preheating in Shaft  The other industrially applied way of preheating the scrap is 
the shaft furnace. They are often DC EAFs with one central electrode and some of 
them operating in twin mode. Currently, more than 20 such furnaces are in opera-
tion (Fuchs, Eco-Arc, and Quantum type). In Fig. 16.9, a scheme of a Fuchs shaft 
furnace is shown, together with the typical charging/melting cycle.

Formation of dioxine has been reported for some of these operations. Main rea-
sons for dioxine formation are (a) plastics in the scrap and (b) critical temperature 
range. In a Japanese version of shaft furnace (Eco-arc by J. P. Plantech), charging is 
performed by means of a skip car instead of a bucket. The shaft has no device for 
keeping the scrap inside. The off-gas treatment includes a post-combustion chamber 
to decompose dioxines and a fast cooling chamber to avoid De Novo synthesis.
Oxy-Fuel Burners  Modern furnaces use oxygen-fuel burners to provide chemical 
energy to the cold-spots, making the heating of the steel more uniform. Oxy-fuel 
burners reduce electricity consumption by substituting electricity with fuels and 
increase heat transfer. Some 136 Oxy-fuel burners are currently installed in the 
EU. The expectation is that this technology may decrease total and direct CO2 emis-
sions by 0.006 t CO2/t crude steel.
Oxy-fuel burners have a long story of optimization and enlargement. Initially, 
Oxygen was introduced in the furnace through the slag door to accelerate melting by 
cutting scrap parts. The combination of Oxygen and Carbon lances was useful then to 
create a foamy slag protecting panels, roof and refractories form the arc radiation. 
After that, lance manipulators were devised to facilitate the lancing operation. Finally, 
burners were introduced through the furnace walls, to inject Oxygen, Carbon, natural 
gas, and lately lime. This equipment resulted easy to maintain and effective for its 
different tasks. Besides, their operation can be automated to a large extent.
Lately, chemical energy tends to contribute with 30 % of the EAF energy input. 
Since the heat duration is short, the large specific oxygen consumption (40 m3/t 
crude steel, in average) requires quite high-intensity injection. In modern furnaces, 
the specific intensity of oxygen blowing is usually 0.9–1.0 m3/t per minute and may 
also reach 2.5  m3/t per minute if hot metal and reduced iron are used in large 
amounts (Toulouesvski and Zinurov 2010).

16.4  CO2 Emissions and the Future of the Electric Arc 
Furnace
As in China and other emerging countries start to have more scrap availability, and 
taking into account that these countries will have a commitment to decrease their 
emission, it is reasonable to expect an increased EAF share in world production, 
instead of the decrease of recent years. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has 
prepared forecasts regarding process routes and consumption of metallic till year 
2050 (International Energy Agency 2012). They defined three scenarios for global 
average temperature increase: 6 °C, 4 °C, and 2 °C. 6 °C is an extension of current 
trends; 4 °C takes into account commitments assumed by countries regarding emis-
sion limits and energy efficiency improvement, and 2 °C is a very restrictive sce-
nario regarding CO2 emissions.
In Table 16.7, the aforementioned scenarios are presented, in relation with their 
influence on process routes and utilization of metallics, in comparison with the base 
situation, year 2010.
Although this forecast has spurred controversy (Mendes de Paula 2013), it 
reflects the current expectations on the future growth of this process route.
16.5  Conclusions
Electric arc furnace-based steelmaking is the low-CO2 alternative to make steel, as 
long as scrap is available at a competitive price. Still, this process route may advance 
in lowering emissions, through the spreading of several technologies that are already 
available and working at industrial scale.
EAF total emissions have a large dependence on the source of electricity: hydro-
electric, nuclear, natural gas, wind, or coal-based.

It is expected that in the future there will be more availability of scrap. This situ-
ation, together with the already mentioned low emission, and other advantages like 
lower investment, less manpower, more flexibility, easier maintenance, would make 
EAF the route of choice for the following decades.

 Technological Methods to Protect 
the Environment in the Ukrainian BOF Shops

 Abstract   BOF process is one of the most productive ways of steel manufacturing. 
Byproducts of this process are metallurgical slag, gases (volatile-rich oxide and 
other chemical compounds), metallurgical dust, and excessive heat. Nevertheless 
there are developed a large number of waste gas cleaning systems and recycling 
technologies, these factors still have negative impact on whole biosphere. The great-
est effect it makes on the atmosphere since during melting, a substantial amount of 
carbon and nitrogen oxides are released into the environment. The steelmaking dust 
can be classiﬁ ed by its origin. The main types of waste dust include: fragments of 
the raw material (as a result of technological overload and crushing of the raw mate-
rials), products of evaporation and condensation (vaporized molten slag and graph-
ite ripe). For their capture in conditions of Ukrainian manufacturing developed a 
number of speciﬁ c technological schemes involving precipitation of dust component 
in special units (Venturi tubes, cyclones, and scrubbers). Their use can reduce the 
concentration of hazardous substances and to the regulated legal framework limit.  
17.1  Introduction 
 Metallurgy is the basis of the Ukrainian economic (11th place in world ranking of 
crude steel production). The most widespread method of steel production is Basic 
Oxygen Process ( BOP ) with top blowing. This high productivity technology allows 
producing low-carbon and carbon steel of ordinary quality. Steelmaking has a nega-
tive impact on the environment because of such wastes as slag, dust, and technologi-
cal gases containing harmful volatile and dangerous substances and excessive heat. 
The greatest impact steel production has on atmosphere. Therefore, the main part of 
the technical solutions for environment protection in Ukraine is reducing emissions 
in atmosphere. 
 The aim of this work is to generalize and clarify information about the ways of 
protecting the environment that are used at the Ukrainian metallurgical plants and

development of technical solutions for complex improvement of technological 
schemes of steelmaking in order to reduce the negative impact on the 
environment.  
17.2  Affection of Harmful Factors of Steelmaking 
Production on the Biosphere 
 The share of ferrous metallurgy in Ukraine accounts for about 20–25 % of total 
 harmful emissions into the atmosphere, and in the areas of the large steel plants is 
more than 50 % of all contaminants. Annually Ukrainian metallurgical plants emit 
in the atmosphere a huge amount of harmful substances (Table  17.1 ).
 In addition, the steel industry is one of the largest water consumers. Modern steel 
plant consumes 180–200 m 3 of water to produce 1 t of rolled steel. Daily water 
consumption may exceed 3 million m 3 . It includes cooling equipment—48 %, waste 
gas cleaning—26 %, metal processing—12 %, hydraulic transport—11 %, and oth-
ers—2 % of water needs. Discharge wastewater from the steel plants in the pond 
increases the amount of suspended solids, much of which are deposited near the 
drain, raises water temperature, deteriorates oxygen regime. On the surface of the 
pond, an oily ﬁ lm can form due to emission lubricant products with water. If the 
efﬂ uents contain acid, it leads to change the water acidity and disturbing biological 
processes.  Pollutants emission causes the death of aquatic organisms and interferes 
in the process of pond self-cleaning. Most metals, their compounds, and other inor-
ganic substances contained in wastewater of metallurgical plants have harmful 
effects on humans and warm-blooded animals, ﬂ ora, macro- and microorganisms. 
 Processes of steel production cause to forming large amount of  solid waste , 
which accumulated on large areas and which have a harmful effect on the soil, ﬂ ora, 
water sources, and air. Solid Waste Dumps now occupy thousands of hectares of 
mineral lands. Slag and dust waste are generated on almost all stages of steelmak-
ing. According to approximate estimation to produce 1 t of steel used 4.7 t of raw 
materials, which produced 0.406 t of waste. 
 Now Ukrainian  metallurgical plants have accumulated about 94 million tons of 
slag produced by steelmaking and ferroalloy industries that occupy about 800 ha. 
And this value signiﬁ cantly increases if we take into account the area occupied by 
waste of refractory from the worn lining of furnaces, ladles, and other aggregates. 
Thus it should be noted that the most dangerous factors is atmosphere pollution, 
which will be discussed  further . 
 Volume of the gases produced by Basic Oxygen Furnace ( BOF ) is cyclical 
(Fig.  17.1 ) and depends on the rate of carbon oxidation and conditions of oxygen 
blowing.

 According to the practical data, volume of BOF gases that emits from the con-
verter throat is 70–90 m 3 /t of steel. The ratio of the maximum decarburization speed 
to the medium with using multinozzle lance is about 1.4. Table  17.2 shows the 
chemical composition of BOF gases.
 In addition to the compounds indicated in Table  17.2  the following gas contents 
were revealed: 50 mg/m 3 SO 2 ; 100 mg/m 3 F 2 and 10 mg/m 3 Cl 2 . Nitrogen oxides are 
not formed in the BOF workspace. However, the post-combustion CO to CO 2 leads 
to the formation of nitrogen oxides in amount of about 100 mg/m 3 or 50 g/t of crude 
steel. Nitrogen oxides are also formed in the post-combusted gases on the stack 
outlet in an amount of 30 g/t of steel. The BOF gases temperature at the outlet of its 
throat constantly increases during oxygen blowing. In the beginning of blowing it is 
1250–1300 °C, and in the middle and at the end—1600–1700 °C. 
 During oxygen blowing BOF gases carry 1.5–2.0 % dust per 1 t of hot metal. 
Concentration of dust in the gases during blowing varies from 20 to 250 g/m 3 (or 
even more) and depends on many factors: the fume extracting and cooling system,

oxygen blowing mode, quality, size distribution, and humidity of lime and other bulk 
materials charged during BOF blowing (Fig.  17.2 ). The maximum value of dust 
emissions observes at the time of charge the bulk materials (indicated by arrows).
 The chemical composition of the dust little depends on the intensity of oxygen 
blowing, but varies greatly during periods of melting.  Grain-size composition of 
dust can be divided into two groups: Fine, which is formed by the iron oxidation 
(<3 mm) and larger factions, which is formed by removal of slag and bulk materials 
particles (>3 μm). Grain-size and chemical composition of dust change during the 
melting. In periods of scrap and hot metal charging and also in the ﬁ rst minutes of 
oxygen blowing dust consists of large fractions (scrap pollution, particles of lime, 
etc.). Then the dust becomes ﬁ ne disperse because of intensive combustion of iron 
in a reaction zone. Averaged grain-size distribution of dust emitted with the gases 
from the BOF is presented in Table  17.3 .
 The next stage of exploration was the complex analysis of technical solution for 
the atmosphere protection on Ukrainian metallurgical  plants .

17.3.1  Cleaning and  Cooling of the BOF Waste Gases 
 As though temperature of the gases emit from the vessel throat is very high, they 
must be cooled before the gas cleaning. Cooling can be carried out by injection of 
water in the gases. The disadvantage of this method is a signiﬁ cant increase of gas 
volume caused by forming of water vapor and inability of heat recovery. Thus this 
method is used only for partial  cooling .

 Application of waste heat boilers ( WHB ) is much better method that is widely 
used nowadays. Cooling by this method almost does not change the gases volume 
and allows recovering their warm. 
17.3.2  BOF Pipeline 
 By way of the BOF gases emissions into the atmosphere  pipelines are divided into 
three groups:
 1.  systems with air leakage through the slit between the BOF and WHB and the full 
post-combustion of CO to CO 2 , i.e., air ﬂ ow factor  α > 1; 
 2.   systems with partial post-combustion of carbon monoxide in the WHB, i.e., at 
0.0 <  α < 1.0; 
 3.  systems without air leakage in the pipeline and without post-combustion of car-
bon monoxide, i.e., at almost  α < 0.15. 
 Mode of pipeline is determined by the pressure maintained in the slit between the 
BOF and the WHB. 
 If at the slit there is kept sufﬁ ciently large rareﬁ ed, then ambient air is injected in 
WHB with the BOF gases. Amount of injected ambient air is sufﬁ cient for combus-
tion of the BOF gases, i.e.,  α > 1.0. In this case, the pipeline works in a mode of full 
post-combustion of carbon monoxide. 
 If at the slit there is kept little rarefy, the volume of injected ambient air is insuf-
ﬁ cient to complete post-combustion of carbon monoxide and pipeline works in a 
mode of partial post-combustion of CO to CO 2 . 
 Depends on rarefy at the slit through the  pipeline will pass complete combustion 
products, not post-combusted BOF gases or partially post-combusted gases. It 
should be noted that converter gas is explosive when  α < 0.75. To avoid explosion it 
needs to exclude the possibility of a collision BOF gases with air, especially in low 
temperatures areas, where the gases do not burn and form explosive mixtures. 
 This requires good hermetic of pipeline and complete exclusion of air leak in it. 
It is also necessary to move volume of inert gas right afore and behind explosive 
gases (CO 2 and H 2 ). 
 For slit pressures higher than the atmospheric one, air does not leak in the pipe-
line and post-combustion of carbon monoxide does not occur ( α ≈ 0). Since in this 
mode the gases can be released into the shop atmosphere, then minimal rarefy at the 
slit is maintained ( α = 0.11–0.15). 
 The rarefy value in slit is regulated by the ﬂ ap in the pipeline before the smoke 
exhauster. 
 Volume of the gases that come to the gas clearing system with full post- 
combustion of carbon monoxide is 3–5 times more than volume of the gases formed 
during the blowing. It results to increase in size of the pipeline, the system of gas 
clearing, power and energy consumption of smoke exhauster. Use of such system 
with the BOF capacity over 200 t is economically inefﬁ cient. But it should be 
installed for the BOF of smaller capacity, because of complete safety.

 The value of the air ﬂ ow rate  α for post-combustion of carbon monoxide signiﬁ -
cantly impacts on the capacity of the pipeline (Table  17.4 ).
 Thus, the same volume of BOF gases would need much smaller pipeline if value 
of air rate  α is small. Switching BOF from a full system of CO post-combustion 
( α > 1.0) to the partial post-combustion system or without any post-combustion of 
carbon monoxide can signiﬁ cantly increase the intensity of blowing and conse-
quently improve BOF  productivity . 
17.3.3  Units with  Full Post-Combustion of Carbon  Monoxide 
 Plants of this type are widely used in Ukraine (Fig.  17.3 ). In the ﬁ replace above the 
BOF CO burns by air which leaks through the fully open slit between the BOF and 
the ﬁ replace.
 After passing through the  WHB   the dusty gases signiﬁ cantly change chemical 
composition and size of dust particles. Because of particle precipitation, especially 
its large fractions of dust in WHB pipes the concentration of dust in the gases before

cleaning is up to 25–60 g/m 3 . On this stage dust mostly consists of iron oxides. Mass 
fraction of ﬁ ne fraction increases to the end of blowing (Table  17.5 ).
 After  WHB gases ﬂ ow to the clearing, which in all Ukrainian BOF plants is car-
ried out in Venturi scrubber. Since after Venturi scrubbers cleaned gases still contain 
dust within water droplets that have harmful effect on the pipes and smoke exhausts, 
they are treated in droplet catcher and then thrown through the chimney in the 
atmosphere. 
 In many countries dry and wet electrostatic precipitators (ESP) and sometimes 
baghouse are widely used for cleaning of the BOF gases. Fabric ﬁ lters are used in 
France, Belgium, USA etc. (Fig.  17.4 ) for BOF gases  cleaning .
 In case of BOF gases cleaning without heat recovery, the gases from the con-
verter (1) ﬂ ow in the cooled ﬁ replace (2), where they are post-combusted and 
cooled, and then sent to the regenerator (3). When ﬂ owing through vertical refrac-
tory channels of regenerator, gases give them their heat. Final cooling of gases 
before baghouse (5) is carried out in evaporation scrubber (4). After the BOF blow-
ing atmosphere air is ﬂ own through the regenerator and cooled its checker. The ﬁ nal 
concentration of dust in the gases that released into the atmosphere through the 
smoke exhauster (6) and chimney (7) is 4.7 mg/m 3 . 
 The cleaning of the BOF gases by cloth ﬁ lters is also performed with heat recov-
ery. In this case for cooling of the gases instead of regenerator the  WHB is used.

17.3.4  Units with  Partial Post-Combustion of Carbon Monoxide 
 There are two modes of the unit with partial post-combustion of carbon monoxide: 
in the ﬁ rst mode the system does not combust CO completely (0.75 <  α < 1); the 
second—with the partial combustion of carbon monoxide at 0.3 <  α < 0.6. The prin-
cipal difference between these modes is that in the ﬁ rst case gases in pipeline cannot 
burn, and the second—they are explosive. 
 Saturated with moisture gases ﬂ are up and burn if consist of at least 20–25 % CO. 
The disadvantage of the ﬁ rst mode (0.75 <  α < 1) is that the amount of carbon mon-
oxide in the gases at the outlet of the stack are much lower. Thus the gases cannot 
be post-combusted and signiﬁ cant volume of toxic CO is emitted in atmosphere. 
 In the mode of partial post-combustion of CO (0.3 <  α < 0.6), CO content is more 
than 25 % during the most of the blowing time and gases post-combust. The slit 
between the BOF and the WHB is entirely open in this mode. Smoke exhauster is 
set up to constant productivity that is on 10–15 % more than volume of the BOF 
gases in the period of maximum gas emission. 
 In the initial period of BOF blowing when exhaust gases consist little CO, the 
system operates in the mode of full post-combustion and there are oxygen and carbon 
dioxide in the pipeline, but not carbon monoxide. That is not explosive exhaust  gases . 
 Excess volume of oxygen in the exhaust gases rapidly decreases with increase of 
the total volume of gases emits from the BOF (i.e. air ﬂ ow through the leak remains 
the same and the volume of CO in the gases increases) and when  α = 1 is about zero. 
At this time exhaust gases almost do not content CO that completely combusted to 
CO 2 . Formed volume of inﬂ ammable gas (CO 2 + H 2 ), is blown through pipeline and 
clears it from remaining oxygen. Right after the volume of inﬂ ammable gas another 
gases ﬂ ow that consists of carbon monoxide but no oxygen. After the end of blow-
ing the same processes occur in the opposite direction. So volume of inﬂ ammable 
gas that is formed in the initial period and at the end of blowing reliably separates 
the transported gas. That does not allow mixing transported gas with air and CO to 
form explosive gas mixtures. In this mode BOF gases cannot be used as fuel. The 
BOF gases with a high content of CO are formed and ﬂ ow out the throat in the pipe-
line just for 6–10 min, i.e., less than 50 % of blowing time. 
 Waste gas could not be used as a fuel in the last period of the BOF melting 
because of reduces of CO content. Thus in all systems with partial post-combustion 
of CO the BOF gases is burnt on the stack before release in the  atmosphere . 
 In systems with partial post-combustion of CO dust content in the gases before 
cleaning is a little more (30–80 g/m 3 of gases) than in systems with full post- 
combustion of CO because of less air leak in the gases. Weight of the formed dust 
is the same as in the full post-combustion, but dust concentration is more as a result 
of the much less air leak in the gases and consequently less volume of waste gases. 
 The chemical and grain-size composition of dust in systems with partial post- 
combustion of CO are almost the same as in the system with full post-combustion CO. 
 By employing wet dust-catcher (Venturi scrubber) the mode of full CO post-
combustion can be easy shifted on partial CO post-combustion. It is needed just to 
seal pipelines, mainly in its coldest part (gas temperature below 800–900 °C), to 
eliminate the possibility of formation of dead air zones, equip the stack with burner,

and make the pipeline of the each BOF unit autonomous. Operation of gas-path 
does not become more complicated, but rather simpliﬁ es, since there is no need for 
any regulation while maintaining complete safety. 
 One of the reasons of the wide application of wet type units (Venturi scrubber) to 
clean the BOF gases regardless of a number of disadvantages (high water consump-
tion, systems for its cleaning, sludge processing, corrosion of equipment, etc.) is 
dangerously explosive gas mixture in the case of ESP application. Some of the 
European and US plants use gas cleaning system with ESP (Fig.  17.5 ).
 The unit includes evaporative gas cooler, through which the high-temperature 
gases (~1000 °C) are ﬂ own. Their temperature depends on the top blowing mode in 
the BOF and the effectiveness of the WHB. In the evaporative gas cooler the gases 
temperature is reduced to about 200 °C due to injection of carefully regulated vol-
ume of water that completely evaporates. Then gases are directed, by smoke 
exhauster to the stack with post-combustion device. 
 Such gas-cleaning units operate with minimal air ﬂ ow rate of  α = 0.2–0.6 and 
provide clean gases emitted through the stack to dust concentration of about 
30–50 mg/m 3 . 
17.3.5  Units Without Carbon Monoxide  Post-Combustion 
 When using the BOF of more than 250 t and blowing intensity more than 4.0 m 3 /
(t · min) the volume of the gases signiﬁ cantly increases. Calculations show that in 
that case installation of the unit with complete CO post-combustion is economically 
inefﬁ cient. The unit without CO post-combustion is more rational because the vol-
ume of the treated gases and therefore the size of the gas pipeline reduce 3–5 times. 
Smaller size of the pipeline favours installation and operation.

 Before treatment the gases consist of (volume): CO 2 —17 %; N 2 —16 %; and 
CO—67 %. In addition, the gases contain (mg/m 3 ): SO 2 —70; H 2 S—30; F—200; 
and Cl—20. After treatment gases can be recycled and used as fuel. 
 Due to the lack of combustion in the pipeline chemical and grain-size composi-
tion of dust emitted from the BOF almost do not change and are the same as when 
using devices with full or partial CO post-combustion. The dust content in the gases 
at the BOF throat is up to 200 g/m 3 . 
 Without CO post-combustion the possibility of formation of explosive mixtures 
of oxygen and carbon monoxide in the pipeline signiﬁ cantly increases. That’s why 
all Ukrainian BOF plants, without CO post-combustion, are equipped with wet type 
(Venturi scrubber) gas cleaning units. 
 Safety of operation, as in units with partial CO post-combustion, is provided by 
forming volume of inﬂ ammable gas mixture (CO 2 + N 2 ) that in the initial period 
and after the blowing reliably separates explosive volumes and prevents their mix-
ing. Formation of the volume of inﬂ ammable gas provides a hood, which hangs 
over the BOF. 
 A rectangular Venturi tube with an adjustable throat section is widespread in the 
big BOF plants working without CO post-combustion (Fig.  17.6 ).

 After the  WHB (2) gases with a temperature of 750–1000 °C are directed into 
water injection pipeline (3). Water supply (11) to the pipeline is carried out with 
circulating. The water cools the gases to 250–300 °C. The hopper of water injection 
pipeline (4) is adjacent to two Venturi tube of the ﬁ rst stage cleaning (5). From the 
Venturi tubes hopper (6) gases make the turn by connecting pipeline (7) and ﬂ ow to 
the second stage of treatment—the adjustable Venturi tube (8). Then after the  hopper 
(9) the gases come to droplet catcher (10), from which through the pipeline (14)

 The gases that ﬂ ow out of the BOF (1) after WHB (2) with a temperature of 
750–1000 °C reach the unit of preliminary water injection and then are directed into 
the shortened Venturi tube (4) equipped with moisture separator (5) and the hopper 
of the ﬁ rst stage (6). Then the gases are sent through the shortening Venturi tubes of 
the second stage (7) in the hopper of the second stage (9). After that the gases through

the centrifugal droplet catcher (10) by pipeline (11) are sucked by smoke exhausters 
and emitted through the stack. The gases are post-combusted on the stack outlet. 
 In order to improve the reliability of operation the following amendments in gas 
cleaning  units were made.
 –  highly dispersed water injection in the top of the lifting pipeline in order to faster 
solidiﬁ cation and cooling of dust particles, and to avoid slagging of  WHB   top lid;  
 –  replacement of pipeline with water injection and the shortening Venturi tubes of 
the ﬁ rst stage by hollow scrubber with water injection. These amendments sim-
plify pipeline, reduce its hydraulic resistance, allow to get rid of large fractions 
of dust and pieces of sludge, reduces abrasive wear and prevent clogging of 
sludge duct; 
 –  installation of the second droplet catcher before the smoke exhauster to protect 
the last from drops formed due to cooling gas saturated with moisture. 
17.4  Decrease of Unorganized Emission of Harmful 
Substances into the Atmosphere on Metallurgical Plants 
  Gas and dust emissions directly emitted in the atmosphere are called unorganized 
emissions . 
 In steelmaking shops unorganized fugitive emissions happen while overloading 
charge materials (scrap, limestone, lime, etc.), ﬁ lling and pouring hot metal in mixers, 
removing of slag from mixers and ladles, tilting of the BOF for charging sampling 
and tapping, secondary treatment of steel and casting in ingots or continuous casting 
machine (CCM), preparation for work and repairing of technological units. 
 There are no forced  ventilation systems in the steelmaking shops. Ventilation is 
carried out by aeration lanterns. Therefore, in all areas where there are unorganized 
emissions of gas and dust in the atmosphere an aspiration system needs to be 
installed. The most simple aspiration system for the treatment of unorganized emis-
sions is shown in Fig.  17.8 .
 When using this system gas and dust emissions from the source are caught by 
umbrella and by the fan or smoke exhauster transported through pipeline to the hop-
per chamber. In the hopper chamber dust particles are deposited due to gravitational 
forces and puriﬁ ed air (smoke) emits through the stack into the atmosphere. Hopper 
chamber, smoke exhauster, and stack are installed out of shop. 
 Among the steelmaking units the mixer is one of the main suppliers of unorganized 
emissions in the atmosphere (Table  17.6 ). While pouring hot metal 0.02–0.05 % of 
its weight becomes the dust.
 For mixers 2500 t capacity as the ﬁ rst stage of  gas cleaning system   the cyclones 
are recommended, and for the second stage—baghouse or ESP. Baghouse cannot 
ﬁ re because the red-hot iron particles, talc, and graphite foam are completely caught 
in the cyclone. Electrostatic breakdown of ESP insulation is also impossible, 
because after the ﬁ rst stage of treatment there is no electrically conducting graphite 
foam in the gas. 
B.M. Boichenko et al.

297
 In order to reduce air leakage in the pipeline the smoke exhausters should be 
installed before gas cleaning unit. Thanks to lubricating qualities of graphite foam, 
there is no abrasion wear of smoke exhausters in this case. 
 The unorganized emissions also can be decreased by the formation of a neutral 
atmosphere in the iron ladle. It can be done by ﬁ lling the ladle with neutral gas or 
by burning natural gas in it. The neutral atmosphere in the iron ladle prevents forma-
tion of iron oxides and emission of brown smoke. 
 In the BOF shops the unorganized emissions reach its maximum value while ﬁ ll-
ing hot metal after scrap charging. The emissions include up to 35 % FeO and 30 % 
graphite foam in the form of particles smaller than 100 μm. Volume of emissions 
mostly depends on scrap quality and ﬁ lling speed. Its value can be reduced by using 
less contaminated scrap. During steel tapping in a teeming ladle a dense smoke is 
formed that contains dust (less than 100 μm), which consists of up to 75 % FeO.

 The aspiration system is employed to catch unorganized emissions there are 
successfully used the  aspiration system , which include umbrella, although they suck a 
lot of air. The umbrellas require minimal workspace and do not disturb staff. On the 
contrary, local extraction near the sources of dust is more effective, but its operation 
is more complicated. 
 Sometimes, to catch unorganized emissions caused by the BOF charging the 
umbrellas in combination with fabric ﬁ lters or scrubbers are used. Aeration systems 
are also installed in the department of bulk materials at the transport devices and 
supply hoppers. 
 The optimal solution to eliminate unorganized emissions is the isolation of the 
BOF vessel using gas-tight storage (“dog house”). Efﬁ ciency of this system is about 
90–95 %. 
 There is performed different kind of operation with refractory in yard of teeming 
ladles preparation. Replacement or partial repair of lining forms signiﬁ cant amounts 
of dust. According to various sources its value can range from 0.01 to 0.2 kg of dust 
per 1 t steel. While drying and heating the recorded emissions were (kg/t of steel): 
SO 2 —0,01; CO—0.1; NO x —0.1; and some CH 4 . At this site there are widely used 
the aspiration systems with umbrella, local extraction of contaminated air, and lids 
on the ladles. Application of unshaped refractory lining in the form of liquid con-
crete as well helps to reduce emissions. 
17.5  Conclusions and Recommendations 
 Volume of gases produced during the BOF melting depends on:
 – blowing mode,
 – type of additives,
 – lance design,
 – height above the bath surface,
 – hot metal composition,
 – blowing intensity,
 – vessel capacity. 
and according to practical data is 70–90 m 3 per 1 t of vessel capacity. 
 One of the effective ways to reduce emissions is application of multinozzle lance. 
 Volume of the BOF gases depends on oxygen consumption for carbon oxidation. 
Application of the modes with partial or without CO post-combustion signiﬁ cantly 
reduces the volume of the BOF gases and dust. It also could be reached by the fol-
lowing measures:
 –  fast forming of a homogeneous slag, 
 –  use of bulk materials without ﬁ ne fractions, 
 –  optimal composition of hot metal, 
B.M. Boichenko et al.

299
 –  scrap clean of nonmetallic materials, 
 –  reducing the blowing intensity at the time of bulk materials charging. 
 Reducing the amount of the dust also occurs when charging bulk materials in the 
vessel before or at the very initial stage of the blowing with small volume of the 
formed gases.

 State of the Art in Air Pollution Control 
for Sinter Plants 
 Christof  Lanzerstorfer 
 Abstract   In integrated steel mills, the sinter plant is one of the major sources of 
emissions to the atmosphere, whereas the emissions of waste water and solid resi-
dues from the sinter plant are usually less signiﬁ cant. Therefore, state-of-the-art 
emission control technology for off-gas treatment is essential in order to comply 
with stringent emission limits. In the ﬁ rst part of this chapter, the sinter process is 
described, the resulting emissions are characterized and primary measures to reduce 
the off-gas volume and the emission of various pollutants are presented. The second 
part gives an overview of the state-of-the-art emission control technologies applied 
in sinter plants for the reduction of particulate emissions, emissions of SO 2 and 
other acid gases, NOx emissions and emissions of dioxins. In the third part, meth-
ods of treating and recycling the residues from sinter plant off-gas cleaning are 
described. The last part describes some possible future developments in air pollu-
tion control for sinter plants.  
18.1  Introduction 
 In an integrated steel mill, the sinter is an important feed material for the production 
of pig iron in the blast furnace. The sinter is produced in the sinter plant by agglom-
eration of the charge which consists of iron ore ﬁ nes, ﬂ uxes and ﬁ ne-grained recy-
cled iron-containing materials such as dusts, sludge and scale. Due to the high 
volume of off-gas from the  sintering process , sinter plants are responsible for a 
signiﬁ cant proportion of the atmospheric emissions from integrated steelworks. 
 The process off-gas from a sinter plant is usually de-dusted in an  electrostatic 
precipitator (ESP) . At some sinter plants, a subsequent process for off-gas desul-
phurization (DeSOx), reduction of dioxin emissions and/or further de-dusting has 
been installed in order to comply with tighter emission limits. In a few sinter plants, 
a process for the reduction of NOx emissions (DeNOx) is also applied.

 Other sources of dust emissions in sinter plants are the  handling and conveying 
of the feed material, the sinter cooler and the crushing and screening of the sinter 
produced. These emissions are extracted by a ventilation system, often referred to 
as the room de-dusting system (Remus et al.  2013 ). 
18.2  Emissions from the Sintering Process and Primary 
Methods of Emission Reduction 
 The limits for emissions to the atmosphere from  sinter plants have been tightened in 
recent years. The current emission limits for Europe and China are summarized in 
Table  18.1 . The  best available technique-associated emission levels (BAT-AELs) for 
air emissions from sinter plants are deﬁ ned in the commission implementing deci-
sion of 28 February 2012, establishing the  best available technique (BAT ) conclu-
sions under Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the council on 
industrial emissions for the iron and steel production. The  BAT-AELs in Europe 
depend on the applied BAT technology for emission reduction.
 For China, ﬁ xed emission limits are valid. The limit values are within the range 
of the European limits. For dust and  polychlorinated dibenzo(p)dioxins and furans 
(PCDD/Fs) , the emission limits are somewhat higher than the European limits, 
while the limit for SOx is lower with the exception of that for the wet DeSOx pro-
cess and the regenerative activated carbon process. 
 BAT for the secondary emissions, the emissions from sinter strand discharge, 
sinter crushing, cooling, screening and conveyor transfer points, is to achieve an 
efﬁ cient extraction and subsequently to reduce dust emissions by using a bag ﬁ lter 
or an ESP. The respective BAT-AEL for dust is <10 mg/Nm 3 for a room de-dusting 
bag ﬁ lter and <30 mg/Nm 3  for de-dusting with an ESP. The Chinese emission limit 
for the secondary dust emissions is also 30 mg/Nm 3 . 
18.2.1  The Sintering Process 
 The  feed material of the sintering process—iron ore, ﬂ uxes, recycling ﬁ nes and a 
solid fuel, usually coke breeze—is mixed and then placed on a continuous, travel-
ling grate called the sinter strand. A burner at the beginning of the strand ignites the 
fuel in the mixture after which the combustion is self-supporting. Underneath the 
strand, there are several wind boxes to draw air and combustion gases down through 
the sintering bed into a duct which is connected to the  induced draft (ID) fan . As the 
sinter mixture proceeds along the sinter strand, the combustion front is drawn down-
wards through the mixture. 
 The  combustion of the coke—approximately 4–6 % of the charge—creates suf-
ﬁ cient heat (1300–1480 °C) to sinter the ﬁ ne particles together into porous sinter. 
The off-gas from the sinter strand contains considerable amounts of entrained par-
ticulate matter and various gaseous pollutants. It is usually de-dusted in an ESP 
18 State of the Art in Air Pollution Control for Sinter Plants

304
before it is released into the air via the main stack. The ESP is installed upstream of 
the ID fan to protect the fan impeller. In some older sinter plants, cyclones are still 
used for this purpose. 
 The fused sinter is discharged at the end of the sinter strand and subsequently 
crushed and screened. The undersize material is recycled back to the feed. The 
remaining sinter product is cooled in a cooler where air is used for the cooling. The 
cooled sinter is crushed and screened again. The ﬁ nes are recycled and the product 
is sent to the blast furnace (Remus et al.  2013 ). 
18.2.2  Emissions from the Sintering Process 
 The particulate matter contained in the off-gas from the sinter strand originates from 
two sources. Firstly, ﬁ ne-grained feed material can be carried by the gas ﬂ ow out of the 
lower parts of the bed. Secondly, some components like alkali chlorides can be volatil-
ized in the high-temperature zone of the bed. These components recondense and form 
very ﬁ ne particles when the off-gas cools down. Typical particle size distributions of 
the particulate matter from the de-dusting of various sinter plants can be found in the 
literature. The mass median diameter of the ESP dust is in the range of 2.8–40 μm, 
while cyclone dust is coarser (Kasama et al.  2006 ; Lanzerstorfer  2015a ). The dust 
remaining in the off-gas downstream of the de-dusting stage is considerably smaller. 
Its mass median diameter is typically less than 1 μm (Fleischanderl et al.  2007 ). 
 The chemical composition of dust emitted from sinter plants has been investi-
gated in several studies (Xhrouet et al.  2002 ; Ahn and Lee  2006 ; Tsai et al.  2007 ; 
Sammut et al.  2010 ; Sinha et al.  2010 ; Lanzerstorfer and Steiner  2015 ). The main 
components of the dust are Fe, C, K, Ca, Cl and S. The dust also contains increased 
amounts of volatile heavy metals, especially Pb and to a lesser extent Cd and Zn 
(Remus et al.  2013 ). In one study, no difference was found in the Hg concentration 
in the off-gas before and after the ESP (Park et al.  2008 ). Therefore, it can be 
assumed that at sinter off-gas temperature nearly all Hg is gaseous. 
 In the sintering process, coke breeze is usually used as the solid fuel to supply the 
thermal energy for sintering. Due to the short residence time of the gas in the com-
bustion zone and the rapid cooling of the combustion off-gas when it ﬂ ows through 
the bed of feed material below the ﬂ ame front, some products of incomplete com-
bustion remain in the off-gas. The main component from incomplete combustion is 
CO. Its concentration in sinter off-gas is in the range of 0.5–1.5 % (vol) (Leuwerink 
and van der Panne  2001 ; Eisen et al.  2004 ; Kasama et al.  2006 ; Remus et al.  2013 ). 
 The S contained in the fuel is oxidized in the combustion zone, and some of it is 
discharged with the off-gas as SO 2 . In sinter pot tests, it was found that approxi-
mately 20–50 % of the S was emitted as SO 2 depending on the basicity of the sinter 
mixture and the speciﬁ c S input (Lanzerstorfer et al.  2015a ). Typical SO 2 concentra-
tions in the sinter off-gas are between approximately 100 and 500 mg/Nm 3 dry 
(Remus et al.  2013 ). However, S-containing recycled material in the feed can sig-
niﬁ cantly increase the SO 2 emissions. 
C. Lanzerstorfer

305
 The emitted NOx  consists mainly of NO. Usually the dominating source is the N 
contained in the coke breeze (Mo et al.  1997 , Remus et al.  2013 ). The typical NOx 
concentration in the sinter off-gas is between approximately 150 and 500 mg/Nm 3 
dry (Remus et al.  2013 ). 
 The emissions of HF and HCl depend on the F and Cl content of the feed mate-
rial and on the basicity of the sinter mixture. The reported sinter off-gas concentra-
tions for HF are in the range of 0.2–4 mg/Nm 3 dry and for HCl 0.7–400 mg/Nm 3 dry 
(Remus et al.  2013 ). 
 Residues which contain oil are the major source of hydrocarbon emissions from 
sinter strands. Hydrocarbons can evaporate before they are reached by the combus-
tion front moving downwards through the bed. Additionally, some hydrocarbon 
emissions result from incomplete combustion of the fuel. The concentration of  non- 
methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) in the sinter off-gas is in the range 
of 0.7–120 mg/Nm 3 dry (Remus et al.  2013 ). In another study, the composition of 
the NMVOC emissions was reported (Tsai et al.  2008 ). 
 Due to the incomplete combustion process in the sinter bed, some  polycyclic aro-
matic hydrocarbons (PAH) can be found in the sinter off-gas. A PAH concentration in 
the off-gas after the ESP of 0.01 mg/Nm 3 was reported (Guerriero et al.  2008 ). 
 Iron ore sintering is one of the most important emission source types for PCDD/
Fs (Quaß et al.  2004 ) and other organohalogen compounds. An overview on the 
formation of PCDD/F in the sinter process is given in several articles. For sintering, 
it is generally accepted that PCDD/Fs are formed through the de novo reaction (Ooi 
and Lu  2011 ; Wang et al.  2003b ). The typical emissions concentration of PCDD/F 
in the off-gas is 0.07–2.86 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 (Remus et al.  2013 ). Measurements 
showed that the congener pattern of PCDD/ Fs and  polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs) is substantially the same for all sinter plants. The contribution of the PCDFs 
to the I-TEQ emission is 80–90 % (Hofstadler et al.  2000 ; Kasai et al.  2001a ; Wang 
et al.  2003b ; Chang et al.  2007 ). 
 PCBs are essentially precursors of the formation of PCDD/F. They are relatively 
volatile and may be driven off ahead of the combustion zone as the sinter bed is 
heated by the gaseous combustion products. PCDD/Fs contained in the recycled 
material can also contribute to PCDD/F formation in the off-gas. Even as they are 
destroyed in the sinter strand while decomposing, the resulting compounds can con-
tribute as precursors to the de novo synthesis. The contribution of PCBs to the total 
TEQ emission (PCDD/Fs and PCBs) is in the range of 5–7 % (Aries et al.  2006 ; 
Grochowalski et al.  2007 ). 
 The concentration of  polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) was found to be in 
the range of 0.4–23.3 pg TEQ/Nm 3 (Liu et al.  2012 ). 
 The steps for crushing, raw material handling, belt charging and discharging 
from the screens all involve the generation of considerable amounts of entrained 
particulate matter. The emissions are normally extracted by the room de-dusting 
system and discharged through a separate stack. The dust concentration after de- 
dusting is in the range of 7–50 mg/Nm 3 depending on the type of de-dusting equip-
ment installed (Remus et al.  2013 ). The PCDD/F concentration in this gas was 
measured in the range of <0.001–0.060 (Anderson and Fisher  2002 ). 
18 State of the Art in Air Pollution Control for Sinter Plants

306
 The composition of the off-gas extracted from  individual wind boxes varies 
considerably along the sinter strand. Characteristic curves are available for the tem-
perature and CO 2 , CO, O 2 , H 2 O, HCl, SO 2 , NOx and PCDD/F content (Kasai et al. 
 2001a ; Brunnbauer et al.  2006 ; Remus et al.  2013 ). These proﬁ les are especially 
important for selective off-gas recirculation. 
18.2.3  Primary  Measures for Emission Reduction 
 There are different ways of reducing the emissions produced in the sintering pro-
cess. The addition of recycling materials to the sinter feed usually increases the 
emissions. Therefore, limits for the quality and the quantity of these recycled mate-
rials lead to a reduction of the emissions produced. 
 Another way of reducing the amount of pollutants emitted is partial recirculation 
of the off-gas. By this technique, the amount of off-gas produced is reduced while 
the concentration of the pollutants in the off-gas stays the same or is increased by a 
factor which is smaller than the reduction factor for the off-gas volume. 
 The emissions of PCDD/F can be reduced by the use of inhibitors like urea, 
monoethanolamine (MEA) and  triethanolamine (TEA) . Usually, the inhibitors are 
added to the charge, but there are reports of tests where an aqueous solution of the 
inhibitor was sprayed into the off-gas in the wind boxes. 
 Increasing the basicity of the sinter to reduce the emissions of acid gases would 
be another primary measure for emission reduction. However, the basicity of the 
sinter is usually a requirement set by the blast furnace operation. 
 Another measure to reduce emissions can be the optimization of the operation 
conditions of the sinter plant. The Taguchi experimental design was used for sinter 
pot tests to optimize sinter plant operation with respect to PAH and PCDD/F emis-
sions (Chen et al.  2008 ,  2009 ). A multi-objective optimization tool was employed 
for sinter plant process optimization targeting emission reduction and productivity 
(Cavaliere et al.  2011 ; Cavaliere and Perrone  2013 ). Numerical and experimental 
analyses allowed the deﬁ nition of the optimal  conditions for the minimization of 
pollutants at acceptable productivity of the sinter plant. 
18.2.3.1  Control of  Recycling Material 
 In integrated steel mills, ﬁ ne-grained materials rich in iron and carbon-like dust, 
sludge and mill scale are usually recycled through the sinter plants (Hansmann et al. 
 2008 ). The recycling is generally controlled depending on the analysis of the mate-
rial because the recycled residues also have some effect on sinter quality, strength 
and productivity. For example, an increased input of Zn into the blast furnace has to 
be avoided because Zn can cause operational problems there (Esezobor and Balogun 
 2006 ), and the sintering process is typically not very efﬁ cient in reducing the Zn 
content (Lanzerstorfer et al.  2015a ). There are further constraints on the materials 
C. Lanzerstorfer

307
that can be recycled to avoid operational problems in the sinter plant. In particular, 
the concentration of hydrocarbons must be controlled to avoid glow ﬁ res in the ESP 
(Remus et al.  2013 ), and the concentration of alkali metals (Na and K) has to be 
limited because of their adverse impact on the removal efﬁ ciency of the ESP 
(Schuster et al.  2003 ; Remus et al.  2013 ). 
18.2.3.2  Off-Gas Recirculation 
 The recirculation of off-gas is an efﬁ cient technique to reduce the amount of off-gas 
discharged through the main stack and to save some fuel at the same time. The CO 
contained in the off-gas recycled to the sinter strand is oxidized when it passes the 
ﬂ ame front. The concentration of CO in the off-gas discharged from the sinter pro-
cess remains more or less unchanged because of the  reaction equilibrium between 
O 2 , CO and CO 2 prevailing in the ﬂ ame front. However, the total amount of emitted 
CO is reduced by the same factor as the off-gas volume. Also the organic pollutants 
(VOC, PAH, PCDD/F) are destroyed when the recycled off-gas passes the high- 
temperature zone of the ﬂ ame front. When recirculated off-gas passes through the 
sinter bed, most of the dust is ﬁ ltered out, and the acid gases SO 2 , HCl and HF can 
react with base components in the sinter bed. 
 Fuel saving results from two effects: ﬁ rstly, when CO is oxidized, the heat of 
reaction of 283 kJ/mol (Haynes  2012 ) is released and secondly, from the sensible 
heat of the recycled off-gas. 
 There are various process designs used for off-gas  recirculation systems . In 
the EOS system, a part of the off-gas collected in the wind boxes is recirculated 
after de-dusting into a hood covering the whole sinter strand. The required O 2 
content in the hood atmosphere is achieved by the controlled addition of fresh 
air. Thus, only a reduced amount of off-gas has to be discharged through the 
main stack (Leuwerink and van der Panne  2001 ). Reported results for the fuel 
saving and the emission reduction achieved by the EOS system at Tata Steel, 
Ijmuiden, are summarized in Table  18.2 .
 The  LEEP process at the sinter plant of HKM, Duisburg aims to recirculate the 
off-gas with the highest pollutant concentrations and energy content. Therefore, the 
off-gas from the wind boxes of the second half of the sinter strand is recirculated 
into hoods covering the whole length of the sinter strand, while the off-gas from the 
wind boxes of the ﬁ rst half of the sinter strand is discharged. As the temperature of 
the off-gas from the ﬁ rst half is substantially lower than the temperature of the off- 
gas from the second half, a Ljungström heat exchanger is installed to reduce this 
difference. Heating-up the off-gas from the ﬁ rst half to a temperature above the acid 
dew points is required to prevent corrosion. Both off-gas streams are de-dusted in 
ESPs before they enter the ID fans (Eisen et al.  2004 ). 
 In the  Eposint system (voestalpine Stahl, Linz, and Dragon Steel, Taichung), the 
recirculated off-gas is also from the second half of the sinter strand. In contrast to 
the LEEP system, the off-gas from the last two wind boxes is added to the off-gas 
from the ﬁ rst half of the sinter strand thus increasing the temperature of this gas

without a heat exchanger. The hood above the sinter strand for off-gas recycling 
does not cover the whole strand but leaves approximately the last quarter of the 
strand uncovered. The air added to the recycled off-gas is collected at the sinter 
cooler outlet because of its higher temperature (Brunnbauer et al.  2006 ; 
Reidetschläger et al.  2012 ). 
 Reported results for the fuel saving and the emission reduction achieved are sum-
marized in Table  18.2 . When the reduction of the emission of a pollutant is lower than 
the reduction of the off-gas volume, the concentration of this pollutant in the off-gas is 
increased due to the off-gas  recirculation . With selective off-gas recirculation for some 
pollutants, the reduction can be even higher than the reduction of the off-gas volume. 
 A selective off-gas recirculation using four different off-gas zones is installed at 
a sinter plant of NSSC, Yawata Works (Sakuragi et al.  1994 ). The off-gas volume 
was reduced by 28 %, and the reported reduction in coke breeze consumption was 
7 %. The reductions in dust and SO 2 emissions are not really comparable because of 
the existing wet DeSOx system for the off-gas from one of the zones. 
18.2.3.3  Suppression of  PCDD/F Formation 
 Primary abatement of PCDD/Fs can be achieved through process optimization 
(Chen et al.  2008 ; Cavaliere et al.  2011 ; Cavaliere and Perrone  2013 ) and feed mate-
rial selection (Xhrouet and De Pauw  2004 ; Nakano et al.  2009 ). A signiﬁ cant 
increase in the discharged amount of PCDD/Fs was found in the case of the recy-
cling of ESP dust to the sinter feed (Kasai et al.  2001b ). 
 The formation of PCDD/Fs can be suppressed by the addition of substances which 
have an inhibiting effect on the formation. Two different methods are described in the

literature. In the ﬁ rst method, nitrogen compounds are added to the solid sinter mix in 
order to inhibit catalytic reactions on the surfaces involved. Tests with the addition of 
MEA, TEA or urea were carried out in different sinter plants. With an addition of 
0.02 % urea to the charge, a reduction in PCDD/F emissions of approximately 50 % 
was achieved (Schoﬁ eld et al.  2004 ; Anderson et al.  2007 ). Also CaO was found to be 
a PCDD/F suppressing agent when added to the charge (Nakano et al.  2009 ). 
 The second method was tested in one sinter plant. The inhibitors MEA and TEA 
were dissolved in water and introduced into the wind boxes by way of spraying 
nozzles. After some time of operation in which the inhibitor was injected continu-
ously, the PCDD/F  concentration was measured and compared with the results of 
reference tests without inhibitor injection. MEA as well as TEA were both effective 
in preventing PCDD/F formation, up to 90 % inhibition was reached using MEA 
(Xhrouet et al.  2002 ; Xhrouet and De Pauw  2003 ). 
18.3  Emission Reduction Processes 
 In the last 25 years, a  second-stage off-gas cleaning system was installed at several 
sinter plants to comply with lower emission limits for dust, SO 2 and PCDD/F. This 
additional cleaning stage can be a wet system or a dry system (Menad et al.  2006 ; 
Delwig et al.  2007 ; Guerriero et al.  2009 ). However, dry systems using a sorption 
process are predominantly used for the separation of acid gases and PCDD/F and a 
fabric ﬁ lter for ﬁ nal de-dusting (Weiss  1998 ; Leroy et al.  2007 ; Lanzerstorfer et al. 
 2008 ; Yu et al.  2009 ). In some sinter plants, a  DeNOx process is also applied (Wang 
et al.  2009 ; Remus et al.  2013 ; Putz  2015 ). 
 An overview of the state-of-the-art technology for sinter plant off-gas cleaning is 
summarized in the “ Best Available Techniques (BAT) Reference Document for Iron 
and Steel Production” (Remus et al.  2013 ). 
18.3.1  Advanced  Dry De-dusting of Sintering Off-Gas 
 In several sinter plants, advanced ESPs were installed to achieve lower dust emis-
sions. The main problem in sintering dust separation with an ESP arises from the 
high speciﬁ c resistivity of the dust (Lee et al.  2001 ; Lanzerstorfer and Steiner  2015 ). 
There are two systems in use at sinter plant ESPs to deal with this problem. 
 The ﬁ rst is pulse energization using microsecond pulses. With pulse energiza-
tion, the peak voltage is higher, providing better particle charging in the precipitator. 
Reported clean dust concentrations after ESP are in the range of 20–75 mg/Nm 3 
(Kim et al.  1997 ; Grass et al.  2004 ; Remus et al.  2013 ). 
 The second is a moving electrode electrostatic precipitator (MEEP). In this ESP 
type, the movable precipitation electrodes are cleaned externally by brushes. Thus 
back corona effects can be reduced (Bastürk et al.  2009 ). Reported clean gas dust 
concentrations are in the range of 25–50 mg/Nm 3 (Buchwalder et al.  2008 ; Ando 
et al.  2011 ; Remus et al.  2013 ). 
18 State of the Art in Air Pollution Control for Sinter Plants

 Bag ﬁ lters are usually applied downstream of the ID fan. The removal of dust can be 
easily combined with the removal of SO 2 and other acidic gases (DeSOx) by injection 
of a base chemical and the removal of PCDD/F and other persistent organic pollutants 
by injection of an adsorbent. All the dust, the un-reacted reagents and the reaction prod-
ucts as well as the adsorbent are ﬁ ltered off by means of the ﬁ lter. A signiﬁ cant propor-
tion of the removed dust is recirculated to the off-gas in order to increase the utilization 
of the consumables and thus reduce the costs. The rest is discharged out of the system 
for disposal. When DeSOx is applied, the solid residues are usually not recycled to the 
sinter strand due to the release of the SO 2  at sinter temperature. The clean gas dust con-
centration after the  ﬁ lter is generally <10 mg/Nm 3 (Remus et al.  2013 ).  
18.3.2  Reduction of  SOx Emissions 
 The ﬁ rst DeSOx systems installed at sinter plants applied wet processes. The off-gas 
was desulphurized by scrubbers using Ca(OH) 2 , Mg(OH) 2 , NaOH or a solution of 
NH 3 as reactants. Most of these systems were installed in Japan (Remus et al.  2013 ). 
In 1998 a semidry DeSOx process was installed at the sinter plant of DK, Duisburg. 
Lime milk is atomized in a spray absorber. After evaporation of the water, the dry 
residue is separated from the off-gas in a fabric ﬁ lter (Moore et al.  2003 ). 
 The new DeSOx systems comprise a dry sorption process in combination with a 
fabric ﬁ lter (Weiss  1998 ; Leroy et al.  2007 ; Hartig et al.  2007 ; Lanzerstorfer et al.  2008 ; 
Remus et al.  2013 ; Wisse  2014 ). In some systems, entrained ﬂ ow sorption is applied 
(Fleischanderl and Aichinger  2009 ), while other systems use various kinds of reactors 
(Schuster et al.  2003 ; Yu et al.  2009 ). When Ca(OH) 2 is used as base reactant, some 
water is added to the off-gas or the reactant because SO 2 separation efﬁ ciency is higher 
at lower temperatures (Fleischanderl et al.  2006 ). When NaHCO 3  is used, no cooling is 
required. This is especially advantageous in the case of a subsequent DeNOx system 
(Fleischanderl and Aichinger  2009 ). The ranges for the stoichiometric factor for 
Ca(OH) 2  and NaHCO 3 consumption are 2–4 and 1.1–1.4, respectively. Reported clean 
gas SOx concentrations after dry sorption processes are in the range of 225–400 mg/
Nm 3 (Remus et al.  2013 ). By mixing a carbon- containing sorbent to the reactant for 
acid gas separation, the PCDD/F emissions can be reduced simultaneously.  
18.3.3  Reduction of  PCDD/F Emissions 
 At some sinter plants, adsorbent is injected prior to the ESP to reduce the PCDD/F 
emissions by an entrained ﬂ ow adsorption process. Usually, lignite coke or activated 
carbon is used as adsorbent. To minimize the risk of glow ﬁ res in the ESP, the car-
bon content of the captured dusts typically has to be limited to <20 %. Thus, lime-
stone or hydrated lime is added as an inert material. In order to minimize the risk of 
ﬁ res, the off-gas temperature has to be <180 °C. With increasing dosing rate the

311
separation efﬁ ciency improves, dosing rates up to 300 mg/Nm 3 lignite coke are 
reported. However, a PCDD/F concentration of <0.1 ng/Nm 3 cannot be safely 
achieved because of the limited injection rate of the carbon-containing adsorbent 
due to the risk of an explosive mixture in the ESP (Bastürk et al.  2009 ). The adsor-
bent and the inert material are dosed into the turbulent stream of the off-gas and 
dispersed by a static mixer. During the ﬂ ow in the ducts, the PCDD/Fs and other 
organohalogen compounds are adsorbed. The residence time between the injection 
point and the gas cleaning device is typically in the range of some seconds. In the 
ESP, the adsorbent and the inert material are collected together with the sinter dust. 
Usually, this ESP dust is recycled to the sinter strand where the PCDD/Fs are 
cracked in the high-temperature zone. 
 At ArcelorMittal, Ghent, a yearly average concentration of PCDD/ Fs of 0.5 ng 
I-TEQ/Nm 3 is achieved with a typical dosing rate of 80 mg/Nm3 of activated coal and 
200 mg/Nm 3 of limestone. Additionally, only strictly limited amounts of grease, oil 
and chloride are added to the raw mix with recycled materials (Bonte et al.  2003 ; 
Remus et al.  2013 ). At ArcelorMittal, Eisenhüttenstadt, 80 mg/Nm 3 of pulverized lig-
nite coke is injected. The PCDD/F concentrations were 0.115–0.255 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 
(Buchwalder et al.  2008 ). At Thyssen Krupp, Duisburg, zeolite and lignite coke is 
injected. The average PCDD/F concentrations were 0.152–0.22 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 
(Remus et al.  2013 ). 
 For dry sorption processes in combination with a fabric ﬁ lter, reported PCDD/F 
concentrations were <0.05–0.23 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 (Remus et al.  2013 ). 
 Activated carbon adsorption systems compete with coupled DeNOx and dioxin 
destruction systems gases (Finocchio et al.  2006 ). The removal efﬁ ciency for 
PCDD/Fs in a tail-end DeNOx system (SCR) on an ng I-TEQ basis was approxi-
mately 70 % (Kasai et al.  2001a ; Wang et al.  2003a ). Laboratory studies show that 
the reduction  efﬁ ciency increases with temperature (Chang et al.  2007 ,  2009 ). 
18.3.4  Reduction of NOx Emissions 
 For the reduction of  NOx emissions , selective catalytic reduction (SCR) plants were 
installed at some sinter plants. In the SCR process, the NOx reacts with the added 
NH 3 to N 2 and H 2 O. This reaction takes place in a reactor that contains a catalyst 
which is usually V 2 O 5 –WO 3 /TiO 2 . In sinter plants, SCR systems are tail-end instal-
lations, where the SCR is installed as the last cleaning stage before the off-gas is 
discharged through the stack. Because of the required reaction temperature, the off-
gas has to be heated from the discharge temperature (typically 120–180 °C) to the 
operation temperature of the catalyst, which is in the range of 250–425 °C (Heck 
 1999 ) depending on the SOx concentration in the off-gas (Institute of Clean Air 
Companies  2009 ). The off-gas is heated in two steps: ﬁ rstly, some of the heat con-
tained in the off-gas after the catalyst is transferred to the off-gas before the catalyst 
in a heat exchanger. Secondly, a gas-ﬁ red burner is used to ﬁ nally reach the required 
temperature. Before the off-gas enters the catalyst, NH 3 is added and mixed as 
homogeneously as possible into the off-gas by a static mixer. 
18 State of the Art in Air Pollution Control for Sinter Plants

312
 The reported reduction efﬁ ciency of the SCR systems at the CSC, Kaohsiung, 
sinter plants is approximately 80 % (Lee et al.  1999 ). The catalyst operation tem-
perature is 350 °C (Wang et al.  2003a ). At voestalpine Stahl, Linz, the sinter plant 
was equipped with a SCR system a few years ago. The sinter off-gas is heated from 
140 °C to about 260 °C in a heat exchanger. Heating to the catalyst operation tem-
perature of 280 °C is done by burners ﬁ red with coke oven gas. The required clean 
gas concentration for NOx of <100 mg/Nm 3 is reached at a NH 3 slip of <0.1 mg/
Nm 3 . After 12,000 operating hours, the measured activity of the catalyst was 98.6 % 
of  the  original value (Putz  2015 ). 
18.3.5  Simultaneous Reduction of SOx and NOx Emissions 
 Simultaneous reduction of SOx and NOx emissions can be achieved by the  regener-
ated activated carbon (RAC) process  . SO 2  is adsorbed on activated carbon (AC) 
which is thermally regenerated. Sulphuric acid is yielded in the regeneration process 
as a by-product. By this process, HCl, HF, Hg, PCDD/F and optionally NOx are also 
removed from the off-gas. The system can be designed as a single-stage or a two-stage 
process. In the single-stage process, the off-gas is led through a bed of AC where the 
pollutants are adsorbed. NOx removal only occurs when NH 3  is injected into the gas 
stream before the AC bed. In the two-stage process, the off-gas is led through two 
beds of AC. The NH 3 for NOx reduction is injected before the second bed. 
 The reported DeSOx efﬁ ciency of a one-stage system is 95 % and the DeNOx 
efﬁ ciency is 15–20 % (Kasama et al.  2006 ). RAC systems are operated at sinter 
plants in Japan, Korea and Australia (Remus et al.  2013 ). 
18.3.6  Advanced Wet Emission Reduction Processes 
 Typical wet scrubbers show limited efﬁ ciency in the collection of ﬁ ne dust. The 
reported clean gas dust concentrations after a two-stage gas cleaning system con-
sisting of cyclones and a subsequent venture scrubber was 70–90 mg/Nm 3 (Shvets 
et al.  2003 ). In the 1990s, some advanced wet second-stage off-gas cleaning sys-
tems were installed at sinter plants (Hofstadler et al.  1999 ; Leuwerink and van der 
Panne  2001 ; Brunnbauer et al.  2006 ). In an  AIRFINE scrubber system, circulating 
water is sprayed into the off-gas by compressed air. The reported dust separation 
efﬁ ciency was 80–90 %, and the dust concentration after the scrubber was in the 
range of 30–40 mg/Nm 3 . A simultaneous reduction of the PCDD/F emissions (Smit 
et al.  1999 ) as well as a reduction of acid gases emissions was reported (Hofstadler 
et al.  1999 ). However, both installations of this technique were replaced by bag ﬁ l-
ter systems in the recent years. 
 At another sinter plant, a wet ESP was installed as second-stage dust separator. 
The reported de-dusting efﬁ ciency is 83 % (Boscolo et al.  2008 ), and the reduction 
of PCDD/F emissions is approximately 70 % (Guerriero et al.  2009 ).

18.4  Residues from  Dry Off-Gas Cleaning at Sinter Plants 
 In dry sinter off-gas de-dusting and DeSOx, the residues are ﬁ ne-grained dusts; no 
waste water is produced. The dry consistency of the residues and the absence of waste 
water are major advantages in comparison with wet off-gas cleaning systems. 
18.4.1  Residue from  De-dusting of Sintering Off-Gas 
 The solid residues from de-dusting with ESPs or cyclones are usually recycled to 
the charge of the sinter plant. In some sinter plants, the dust collected in the last 
electrical ﬁ eld of the ESP is excluded from recycling because of the high concentra-
tion of chloride (Remus et al.  2013 ). The reason for the exclusion is that chloride is 
volatilized to a great extent in the sintering process in the form of alkali chlorides 
and discharged with the off-gas (Debrincat and Loo  2007 ). The chlorides are pres-
ent as KCl and to a lesser extent as NaCl (Ahn and Lee  2006 ; Peng et al.  2008 ,  2009 ; 
Zhan and Guo  2013 ). When the off-gas temperature  decreases , the alkali chlorides 
condense on the dust and are collected as dust in the ESP. Thus, higher recycling 
rates of chlorides lead to an up-cycling of chloride in the sintering process resulting 
in a higher alkali chloride concentration in the off-gas which negatively inﬂ uences 
the performance of the ESP (Schuster et al.  2003 ). Therefore, ESP dust with a 
higher chloride concentration is not recycled in the sintering process but has to be 
disposed of in landﬁ ll sites (Eisen et al.  1996 ). 
 For reduction of the amount of chloride-containing dust which has to be excluded 
from recycling, air classiﬁ cation of ESP dust was investigated (Lanzerstorfer 
 2015b ). The results showed that this would be a feasible process for the treatment of 
the ESP dust. By separating off the ﬁ nest fraction with the highest chloride content, 
the amount of recycled dust can be increased while keeping the recycled amount of 
chloride constant. 
18.4.2  Residues from  Desulphurization of Sintering Off-Gas 
 The residue from dry second-stage off-gas cleaning is a ﬁ ne-grained powder. Its 
ﬂ owability is poor, especially when NaHCO 3 is used instead of Ca(OH) 2 as reagent 
(Lanzerstorfer  2015c ). The residue has to be disposed of in landﬁ lls because of the 
high concentrations of S and Cl which are the result of the separation of SO 2 , HCl 
and the ﬁ nest dust fraction (Peng et al.  2008 ,  2009 ). Recycling of this residue in the 
sinter process would result in increased SO 2 emissions (Remus et al.  2013 ). In order 
to avoid landﬁ ll disposal, leaching of this residue with water was investigated. The 
yielded material can be reutilized in the cement industry (Xu et al.  2012 ) or can be 
recycled to the sinter plant (Lanzerstorfer et al.  2015b ). However, a signiﬁ cant 
amount of salty water, which has to be discharged, is generated by these processes. 
Therefore, such a process is only feasible for sinter plants located near the sea. 
18 State of the Art in Air Pollution Control for Sinter Plants

314
 Guo et al. ( 2009 ) investigated the utilization of the residue from semidry 
desulphurization as cementing material. After thermal treatment of the residue at 
450 °C, the addition of up to 20 % of the residue did not negatively inﬂ uence the 
properties of the  produced  samples. 
18.5  Future Developments 
 Some developments for improved sinter plant off-gas cleaning are currently under 
investigation. If the technical reliability and the economy of these technologies are 
proved, their application could inﬂ uence state-of-the-art off-gas cleaning of sinter plants. 
18.5.1  Reduction of  NOx Emissions in Sinter Plants 
with Catalytic Bags Filters 
 This technology combines de-dusting and DeSOx with entrained ﬂ ow injection in a 
fabric ﬁ lter with membrane ﬁ lter bags and DeNOx with an additional catalytic 
membrane placed inside the fabric membrane. The fabric membrane provides the 
protection of the catalytic support by the removal of dust and acid gases. Tests with 
off-gas from a sinter plant were performed in a small pilot unit. The off-gas was 
heated to 220 °C before it entered the bag ﬁ lter. The reported results from small- 
scale pilot tests at a sinter plant showed up to 80 % reduction of NOx when the SOx 
concentration was kept below 15 mg/Nm 3 . The destruction efﬁ ciency for PCDD/F 
was approximately 90 %. However, maintaining such a low SOx concentration by a 
dry sorption process required a high injection rate of the sorbent (Iosif et al.  2015 ). 
18.5.2  Single-Stage Gas Cleaning with a Bag Filter 
 The use of a fabric ﬁ lter for sinter plant de-dusting upstream of the ID fan did not gain 
widespread acceptance (Kazyuta et al.  2004 ; Remus et al.  2013 ). The recently installed 
fabric ﬁ lters with a dry sorption process for removal of acid gases are all installed 
downstream of the ID fan. There are two reasons for this arrangement. Firstly, the static 
pressure difference for the ﬁ lter casing is lower because upstream of the ID fan there is 
negative pressure of 15–20 kPa. Secondly, the two-stage design enables the separate 
collection of the residues. Usually, the residue from the ﬁ rst de-dusting stage can be 
recirculated to the sinter process, while the residue from the second cleaning stage has 
to be disposed of in landﬁ ll sites to avoid a build-up of Cl and S in the system. 
 A single-stage off-gas cleaning concept for new sinter plants was suggested 
(Lanzerstorfer and Neuhold  2015 ). It comprises an entrained ﬂ ow sorption process 
and a fabric ﬁ lter, installed upstream of the suction fan. In this way, the investment 
C. Lanzerstorfer

315
costs for the off-gas cleaning  system could be reduced. Air classiﬁ cation of the residue 
was investigated to avoid landﬁ lling of the whole residue. In laboratory tests the 
residue was split into two fractions: one fraction with a low Cl and S content for 
recycling to the sinter feed and a second fraction that contains most of the Cl and S. 
18.5.3  Metal Mesh Dust Filter 
 A new off-gas ﬁ ltration process was tested in pilot tests using metallic ﬁ lter screens. A 
ﬁ lter cake is built on the mesh from the particles in the off-gas which then acts as a ﬁ lter 
medium. This cake has to be formed in a recirculation operation mode. A dust outlet 
concentration of <10 mg/Nm 3 was achieved (Briggs et al.  2004 ; Schoﬁ eld et al.  2004 ). 
18.6  Conclusions 
 Off-gas cleaning at iron ore sinter plants is still an area of importance for integrated 
steel mills. The emission limits for sinter plants have been tightened in recent years. 
Several competing technologies are available to reduce the emission of dust, SO 2 , 
NOx, HCl, HF and PCDD/Fs to these limits. Due to different operating conditions 
and raw materials, the emissions and, therefore, the requirement for emission con-
trol systems differ from sinter plant to sinter plant. Thus, the selection of the appro-
priate technology is a demanding task. The overview of the state of the art in air 
pollution control for sinter plants given in this chapter attempts to present a survey 
of off-gas cleaning technologies applied in sinter plants.

 Risk Assessment and Control of Emissions 
from Ironmaking 
 Tao  Kan ,  Tim  Evans ,  Vladimir  Strezov , and  Peter  F.  Nelson 
 Abstract   Processing of raw materials to valuable products results in the formation 
of undesired compounds due to feedstock impurities and process inefﬁ ciencies. 
During the iron and steelmaking process, iron ore is converted to iron and steel at 
high temperatures using carbon energy sources. As the iron ore and carbon sources 
contain minor and trace element impurities and the combustion of carbon is incom-
plete, certain undesirable compounds may be formed that can be detrimental if 
emitted to the environment. These emissions can pose signiﬁ cant risks to humans 
and to the health of the ecosystem. This chapter outlines the various emissions asso-
ciated with ironmaking, the risks these emissions pose to the environment and the 
technologies employed to minimise or eradicate the pollutants.  
19.1  Introduction 
 The iron and steelmaking industry is a highly material and energy-intensive process 
contributing to pollutant emissions and signiﬁ cantly affecting the air, water and soil 
quality. For example, in China, the atmospheric emissions of SO 2 , NO x (nitrogen 
oxides), PM 2.5 (particulates with size of less than 2.5 μm) and VOCs (volatile organic 
compounds) from the iron and steelmaking industry were estimated to be approxi-
mately 2.2, 0.9 and 0.6 Mt respectively with the total crude steel production of 731, 
040 Mt in 2012 (World Steel Association  2015 ; Wu et al.  2015 ). Pollutants are 
mainly formed from the conversion of minor and trace element impurities as well 
as other contained compounds during the processing of iron ores and other raw 
materials.

 Pelletising: agglomeration of ﬁ ne iron ores to produce pellets using a pellet 
plant 
 Sintering: agglomeration of ﬁ ne iron ores to produce sinter using a sinter plant 
 Cokemaking: metallurgical coke production using coke ovens 
 Ironmaking: pig iron production using ironmaking blast furnaces 
 (b)  Direct reduced iron (DRI) plants 
 2.  Steelmaking processes:
  (a)  Steel production:
 Steelmaking using  basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) which is typical for inte-
grated plants 
 Using  electric arc furnaces (EAF) which is typical for DRI plants 
 (b)  steel reﬁ ning, casting and shaping:
 Ladle metallurgy furnaces (LMF) 
 Continuous casters and batch casting in ingot moulds 
 Shaping the steel in rolling mills 
 The ironmaking processes account for the majority of pollutant emissions from 
the entire iron and steelmaking industries. This chapter is thus mainly focused on 
the pollutant emissions from the main processes of an integrated ironmaking plant, 
including sintering, pelletising, cokemaking and ironmaking blast furnaces. 
 These processes emit pollutants of different amounts. For example, in the  sinter-
ing process , signiﬁ cant amounts of SO 2 are contained in the exhaust gas while in 
blast furnaces most sulphur partitions to the iron and slag. Sinter plants contribute the 
largest share of pollutant emissions in the ironmaking plants and are the second larg-
est emitter after  municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration (Philip  1999 ). For exam-
ple, in China, sinter plant emissions are responsible for around 70 % of the atmospheric 
emissions of SO 2 and VOCs, 50 % of NO x , 25 % of PM 2.5 , 98 % of PCDD/Fs (dioxins 
and furans) and 10 % of CO x (carbon oxides) (Gan et al.  2012 ; Wu et al.  2015 ). 
 Pollutant minimisation and recycling are major concerns for retaining the sus-
tainability of industrial operations. The updating and implementing stricter environ-
mental regulations by global governments (e.g. US Environmental Protection 
Agency and European Commission) are driving technological improvements in the 
iron and steel industry. For developing countries (e.g. China and India), there is 
much room for technological improvement and huge investments are required to 
avoid further lagging behind the developed countries. To comply with legislations, 
a variety of technologies and facilities have been employed to minimise or even 
eliminate the pollutant emissions. 
 This chapter is intended to give an introduction to the types of pollutant emis-
sions, material inputs and outputs (especially the pollutant outputs) of ironmaking 
plants, and the commonly adopted abatement measures (primary and secondary) of 
various pollutant emissions. The effects of pollutant emissions on environment and 
human health as well as the quantitative assessment of the corresponding risks are 
also presented in the ﬁ nal section of this chapter.

19.2  Pollutant Types and Their Effects 
 Pollutant emissions can  be categorised into several groups based on the affected envi-
ronmental media: (1) pollutant emissions to atmosphere, (2) pollutant emissions to 
water and (3) pollutant emissions to soil. These emissions are further subcategorised 
according to their chemical nature. The majority of research has been devoted to the 
pollutant emissions to atmosphere which mainly consist of SO x , NO x , particulate 
matter (PM), heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs) and dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs). Among these, SO x , 
NO x , CO, Pb and PM (PM 10  and PM 2.5 ) are priority pollutants. PCDD/Fs and PAHs 
have been of great research interest in recent years. They are air toxics in the category 
of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are resistant to environmental degrada-
tion and pose severe effects to human health  and environment (Zhang et al.  2012 ). 
 Gaseous and particulate pollutants have different negative impacts on the envi-
ronment and human health. CO 2 , CH 4  and N 2 O are greenhouse gases (GHG) that 
can contribute to the radiative forcing of the atmosphere. NO x and SO 2 are acidic 
gases contributing to wet and dry acid deposition. CO, CH 4 and NO act as precur-
sors for tropospheric ozone formation through photochemical reactions, which then 
make the major component of smog. 
 The atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is one of the most vital indices of  ambi-
ent air quality . It can result in severe damage to the respiratory and cardiovascular 
systems of human beings. According to the particle diameter, for regulation pur-
poses, PM emissions are generally deﬁ ned as PM 10 (<10 μm) and PM 2.5 (<2.5 μm). 
 VOCs refer to a variety of organic  compounds with low boiling points (usu-
ally < 100 °C), such as benzene and derivatives (e.g. toluene and p-xylene) and 
formaldehyde. Some of the VOCs will cause the generation of ozone and other 
photo oxidants, which subsequently cause harm to the environment and human 
health. Generally, VOCs can cause irritation to the eyes, nose and throat and possi-
bly other long-term health effects and even cancer. The target annual limit of aver-
age benzene concentration for VOCs from  2010  was set to be 5 μg/m 3 by the 
 European Commission (Ciaparra et al.  2009 ). 
 The persistent organic pollutants, PAHs and PCDD/Fs, have also attracted much 
concern for environmental regulation, speciﬁ cally for iron and steelmaking.  PAHs 
have been determined to expose high risk of carcinogenicity for which the concen-
tration value of benzo [ a ] pyrene (B[ a ]P) is selected as the indicator. They are also 
harmful to the skin and respiratory systems of human bodies. In Europe, the B[ a ]P 
in air was targeted at 10 −9 g/m 3 by the end of 2012 (Ciaparra et al.  2009 ). Among all 
the iron and steelmaking sectors, cokemaking, sintering and ironmaking blast fur-
naces are the main sources of PAH emissions. 
 The formation of  PCDD/Fs may take place during any combustion reactions in 
the presence of C, O and Cl (Demirbas  2008 ). Dioxins and furans have speciﬁ c 
molecular heterocyclic structures with impregnated halogen atoms such as chlorine. 
PCDD/Fs refer to polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxins and dibenzofurans, which are 
highly hazardous and carcinogenic. The total toxicity of PCDD/Fs in gas is com-
monly expressed as international toxicity equivalents (I-TEQ).

19.3  Material Inputs and Outputs of Iron Industrial 
Processes 
19.3.1  Sintering Process 
 The  sintering process aims to agglomerate ﬁ ne iron-bearing particles into larger 
porous clinkers (sinter product) that are suitable for use in blast furnaces. The input 
 materials generally include ferrous materials (e.g. natural iron ores, ﬁ ne iron ore 
powder from screening, slag, mill scales and sludge from iron and steelmaking), 
ﬂ uxes (e.g. limestone or dolomite) and 5 % solid fuels (e.g. coke breeze or anthra-
cite). The simpliﬁ ed ﬂ ow diagram of a sinter plant with inputs and emissions is 
shown in Fig.  19.1 .
 In a sintering process, the blend of input materials is loaded onto the travelling 
sinter strand to form a sintering bed, where the sintering reactions take place. At the 
start point of the sinter strand, the ignition burners ignite the coke breeze in the 
blend, and the combustion initiates as air is sucked through the bed. Very high bed 
temperatures (>1300 °C) cause the bed material to melt and agglomerate to form the 
sinter product. The produced combustion gas is pulled down through the sinter bed 
height into the wind boxes beneath the strand by suction fans. An entire sintering 
cycle occurs from the ignition of coke breeze in the sinter mixture to the burn- 
through point (Lu et al.  2015 ). 
 The  exhaust gas   in the wind boxes is a complex mixture of (1) ﬁ ne particle mat-
ter which comprised of contains heavy metals and organic compounds; (2) low 
concentrations of CO, NO x (e.g. 200 ppm) and SO 2 (e.g. <500 ppm); (3) low con-
centrations of PCDD/Fs; and (4) miscellaneous minor constituents such as HCl, HF 
and moisture (Chen et al.  2008a ; Zhang et al.  2012 ).

 The exhaust gas also  possesses other properties, such as a wide temperature 
range and ﬂ uctuating gas amounts with large ﬂ ow rates (e.g. 100 m 3 /(m 2 min)).  As 
shown in Fig.  19.1 , particulate matter is emitted along the entire ﬂ ow of the sinter-
ing process. Materials handling, wind box exhaust gas, sinter discharge (crushing 
and hot screening) and cold screening contribute to the major emissions of particu-
late matter.  Wind boxes experience the most noteworthy concentrations of PM 
emissions and carry iron and sulphur oxides, carbonaceous materials, heavy metals, 
metal chlorides, aliphatic hydrocarbons, dioxins and other possible contaminants, 
e.g. NH 3 (ammonia), As (arsenic), and ﬂ uorides. The main components of PM 
emissions from sinter crushing and hot screening are generally iron oxides and 
calcium oxides. The particle size of sinter plant dusts mostly ranges below 
10 μm which is different from the blast furnace particle size distribution which 
can range up to 1000 μm in size (Formoso et al.  2000 ). The effective removal of 
ﬁ ne particulates and aerosols at sinter plants is a difﬁ cult technical problem 
(Menad et al.  2006 ). 
 The concentrations of CO x , NO x , SO x , VOCs, HCl and HF depend on the quality 
of the input raw materials as well as the reaction conditions. CO 2 and NO x are dis-
charged into the wind boxes throughout the entire sintering cycle. The combustion 
of fuels contributes more than 90 % of the NO x emissions with the rest from other 
components of the sinter mixture. For example, in China the iron and steelmaking 
industry annually produced NO x of up to millions of tons, most of which was caused 
by the sinter plants (Chen et al.  2008b ). 
 The majority of generated SO 2 is ﬁ rstly detained by the wet zone in the lower 
sinter bed and then released when the burn-through point approaches (Lu et al. 
 2015 ).  SO 2 arises from the combustion of sulphur in the charged solid fuels, such as 
coke breeze or anthracite, and the oxidisation of the sulphur contained in the ﬂ uxes 
and other sulphur-bearing materials (e.g. ferrous ﬁ nes). 
 VOCs are also produced mainly due to the evaporation of oils contained in cer-
tain materials (e.g. mill scale) and are pulled into the wind boxes before  the forma-
tion of the sinter (Carmichael and Carson  1998 ). 
 PCDD/Fs  can  be also present in the exhaust gas. Sinter plants are a signiﬁ cant 
source of PCDD/F emissions. According to the statistical data by the European 
Environment Agency (EEA), during 1993–1995, sinter plants in Europe emitted ﬂ ue 
gases with dioxin content of 1–10 × 10 −9  g I-TEQ (International Toxic Equivalent) 
per m 3 (Menad et al.  2006 ) which accounted for more than 90 % of the total dioxin 
emitted by the entire iron and steelmaking industry (Babich et al.  2008 ). In China, 
PCDD/F emissions from sinter plants are responsible for nearly 60 % of the metal-
lurgical plants or about 26 % of the total national PCDD/F emissions (Yu et al.  2012 ). 
 The formation of PCPP/Fs during the sintering process may be due to (1) the 
combustion of the chlorinated precursors (e.g. chlorinated aromatics) in the sin-
ter bed and/or (2) the de novo synthesis reaction of chlorinated precursors with 
hot ﬂ y ash which is catalysed by Cu and other metals such as Fe (Lu et al.  2015 ). 
 Other molecules such as HCl, Cl 2 and gaseous chlorides presented in the exhaust 
gas should be the result of high-temperature reactions of chlorine- containing  com-
pounds such as sodium and potassium chlorides.

19.3.2  Iron Ore Pelletising 
19.3.2.1  Iron Ore Pelletising Process 
 With the depletion of high- grade lump ores and sinter ﬁ nes, iron ore pelletising has 
gained popularity during the past 2–3 decades (Cameron et al.  2015 ).  Pellet plants 
are nowadays confronted with less stress from the increasingly stricter environmen-
tal legislations than the sinter plants due to the following three reasons (Poveromo 
 2006 ):
  (a)  The majority of the global pellet plants were constructed during the past 30–40 
years and equipped with relatively more modern pollutant abatement systems 
than sinter plants. 
 (b)  Release of lower emissions from pelletising than sintering due to the different 
nature of the two processes. 
  (c)  Considerable degradation and mass loss of sinter feed occur during handling 
and transportation. On the contrary, for pellet feed, the effect is minor. Most pel-
let plants are located at or close to the remote mining areas contrary to the sinter 
 plant location at iron and steelmaking plants in urban areas with stringent laws. 
 Pelletising process involves three major steps of:
  (a)  Pretreatment: mixture  preparation  of iron ore concentrate, coal or coke breeze, 
ﬂ uxes (e.g. limestone, dolomite, olivine and quartz), binders (mainly bentonite, 
hydrated lime and organic binders), moisture and other additives  
 (b)   Balling: production of green  pellets in balling drums or discs followed by 
screening 
  (c)  Induration, cooling and ﬁ nal screening: heating of green balls to very high tem-
perature (1250–1400 °C) in induration furnaces to form hard pellets (Carvalho 
et al.  2015 ) External fuels are used to supply the required heat, including liquid 
(e.g. fuel oils), gaseous (e.g. natural gas and coke oven gas) and solid (e.g. coal) 
fuels. Solid carbonaceous materials (e.g. coal) may be added into the iron ore 
concentrate in advance. Final pellets of 6–18 mm after screening are ready for 
use in blast furnaces. 
 The induration is the core operation of the pelletising and typically consists of 
four distinct  phases : drying, preheating, ﬁ ring and cooling. Three commercially 
available induration furnaces are (1) shaft, (2) straight/travelling grate and (3) 
grate–kiln system wherein the induration of green pellets takes place in the rotary 
kiln. Other new emerging induration technologies such as circular pelletising are 
underway (Cameron et al.  2015 ). The overall inputs and outputs of the pelletising 
process can be described by Fig.  19.2 .
 The waste gases from pellet plants mainly include CO 2 , CO, CH 4 , NO x and SO 2 . 
Other pollutant emissions such as PM, VOCs, PCDD/Fs, ﬂ uorides, heavy metals 
(lead and mercury) and other trace elements are also commonly present. 
 Among these, the  NO x  emissions are of particular concern. There are three 
main mechanisms for explaining the formation of NO x (Dean and Bozzelli  2000 ). 
T. Kan et al.

327
For the pelletising process, the NO x emissions are primarily generated through the 
fuel—NO x route followed by the thermal—NO x formation. However, the genera-
tion of induration NO x is dominated by the thermal—NO x route (Bolen  2014 ). 
 Several technologies have  been  applied to reduce the NO x pollutant emissions in 
most modern pellet plants. Wet scrubbers, bag houses and ESPs are used for fugitive 
particulate removal at some points of the material handling such as cooler discharge 
(Bolen  2014 ). The recycled dust can be reused as a raw material for pelletising. 
 The fuel type and amount used in the pellet induration largely determine the NO x 
emissions from pellet plants where NO x is typically NO (Zahl et al.  1995 ). Generally, 
the combustion of the natural gas produces more NO x than coal due to the reaction 
of nitrogen in the excessive air at the extremely high-temperature ﬂ ame generated 
by the natural gas (Engesser  2004 ). It was also found that the NO x  amount increases 
with ﬂ ame temperature. Thus, the addition of coal into the green pellets could be 
able to reduce NO x production during the induration. 1 % coal addition succeeded to 
decrease the NO x production by 10–12 % in the peak pellet temperature range of 
about 1200–1260 °C (Engesser  2004 ). An investigation into the NO x formation in a 
rotary kiln test facility showed that the use of coal or biomass could result in lower 
NO x emissions than the use of oil or gas (Johannes  2014 ). Reduction reactions of 
NOx on char could also be responsible for decreases in observed NO x . 
 Contrary to NO x , SO 2 is hard to reduce during the pelletising process. SO 2 is 
formed by oxidisation of sulphur which may be present in most raw materials and 
external fuels. Thus, reduction in SO 2 emissions can be achieved by using low- 
sulphur content raw materials and external fuels. More recently built pellet plants 
may also have installed desulphurisation devices  for SO 2 removal, such as lime 
slurry, to react with SO 2 .

19.3.2.2  Comparison of Sintering and Pelletising 
 Figure  19.3 presents typical  amounts  of several emissions from pelletising and sin-
tering according to the date provided by Poveromo ( 2006 ). The amounts of different 
emission types from pelletising and sintering are distinct, especially SO 2 , CO and 
CO 2 . Pelletising of hematite and magnetite typically emits SO 2 of 200 and 100 g/t 
pellet respectively while sintering produces around 1700 g/t sinter. CO emissions 
from pelletising are lower than 1 kgt/t pellet compared to the value of about 40 kg/t 
sinter for sintering. CO 2 production from pelletising is only 1/7–1/8 of that from 
sintering (Poveromo  2006 ).
 The differences in emissions between the above pelletising of hematite and mag-
netite are mainly related to the variation in their fuel requirements. In addition, 
compared to sinter plants, pellet plants generally emit much less  non-methane vola-
tile organic compounds (NMVOCs) and PCDD/Fs but more heavy metals (such as 
Pb, Cd, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn)  and  other hazardous nonmetal elements (such as As 
and Se) per unit mass of sinter or pellet product. For example, according to the data 
from the European Commission in 2001, sinter plants emitted uncontrolled 
NMVOCs of 138 g/t and Pb of 3.5 g/t sinter (European Environmental Agency 
2013). For pellet plants, the emissions  of uncontrolled NMVOCs and Pb are 14 and 
20 g/t pellet respectively.

19.3.3  Cokemaking 
 Cokemaking involves the decomposition of bituminous coals in the absence of oxy-
gen to remove volatile matter, producing a solid residual of coke, and by-products 
including coke oven gas, coke breeze, tar, light oils and other chemicals.  Cokemaking 
takes place in batteries which house 10–100 ovens. Coal is charged into the ovens 
from their top, and the heat required for coal decomposition is supplied by the com-
bustion of recycled coke oven gas, natural gas or other gas fuels. Most coking plants 
integrate by-product facilities that are used to collect distilled volatile matters and 
purify the untreated coke oven gas (‘foul’ gas). By-product chemicals such as tar, 
light oils, naphthalene and ammonia can be recycled from the gas. 
 Figure  19.4 illustrates typical yields (wt%, based on the coal feed) of major prod-
ucts/by-products from cokemaking. The  yields  were calculated from the data found 
in the literature (Energetics  2000 ). Coke and coke breeze are the dominant solid 
products with yields of 63.5 and 6.8 %, respectively. A considerable amount of the 
coal feed is converted to the coke oven gas with a yield of approximately 15 %. 
Ammonia liquor and coal tar are the most outstanding liquid products with respec-
tive yields of around 6.5 and 5 %. Other products such as light oil and ammonia 
sulphate are formed at yields of less than 4 %.
 Figure  19.5 illustrates a  typical  composition (vol%) of major species in  coke 
oven gas . Hydrogen and methane are the dominant components with contents of 
around 52 and 30 % respectively. The concentrations of other components are below 
10 %. The contained minor gas species generally involve benzene (C 6 H 6 ) of 21–36 g/
m 3 , PM of 2–36 g/m 3 , toluene (C 7 H 8 ) of 2–3 g/m 3 , hydrogen cyanide (HCN) of 
0.1–4 g/m 3 , etc. (US Environmental Protection Agency  1988 ; Nelson et al.  1991 ; 
Association of Iron and Steel Engineers  1998 ).
 The cokemaking process with corresponding emission sources can be schemati-
cally described as illustrated in Fig.  19.6 . The process is  comprised  of more than 10 
modules, including production of blast furnace coke (consisting of coal preparation, 
coke oven batteries, coke removal with water quenching and coke screening with 
storage) followed by downstream treatments of foul gas consisting of ammonia 
spray, condenser/exhauster, tar extractor, saturator and condenser, absorption tower 
and a scrubbing tower. The ﬁ nal clean coke oven gas after treatment can be com-
busted for heat supply to the coke oven batteries, used in other processes or sold.
 PM is released during the physical handling (e. g., pushing, charging and load-
ing) of the raw coal material and the coke product as well as during the cokemaking 
in battery ovens. VOCs and other small-molecule gases, such as SO 2 , NO x and CO, 
are primarily generated as by-products of coking. Other dominant emissions include 
ammonia, coal tar, wastewater, sludge and tar residue which are produced along the 
streamline of foul gas treatment. 
 During cokemaking, ammonia results from the high-temperature (>700 °C) deg-
radation of nitrogen-containing organics as part of the  secondary  decomposition 
reactions.  Ammonia is irritating to skin, eyes and the respiratory system and can 
cause damage to lungs or even death if the ammonia concentration in the air is very

high. Ammonia may aggravate the eutrophication of some water resources. It can 
react with sulphate ions and return to the earth surface by rainfall. PAHs are released 
as fugitive emissions from leakages in the coke oven doors, lids, pipes and charging 
and pushing operations. 
 Large amounts of pollutant emissions are generated due to the enormous coke 
demand in ironmaking plants. Table  19.1 exhibits an example of  pollutant produc-
tion amounts  (kg) per one tonne of coke manufactured.
19.3.4  Ironmaking in  Blast Furnaces 
 The majority of ironmaking  takes   place in blast furnaces, although other iron-
making technologies have been developed. The basic process of blast furnace 
ironmaking with inputs and outputs is shown in Fig.  19.7 . The overall inputs 
mainly include iron-bearing materials (lump ore, sinter, pellets, scrap, etc.), 
ﬂ uxes (e.g. limestone and dolomite), coke, other types of fuels (e.g. coal, coke 
breeze and coke tar), hot air blast, air, oxygen, coke oven gas, natural gas or fuel 
oil and water.

 The outputs primarily include molten pig iron (iron saturated with carbon) which 
is then sent to steelmaking, molten slag, blast furnace gas, PM and wastewater and 
sludge. 
 Tapping of the blast furnace to extract pig iron and slag releases considerable 
emissions. During tapping, some metal oxides, such as magnesium oxide, and car-
bonaceous materials are released as particulates (European Environmental Agency 
 2013 ). Particle emissions also arise from the charging and conveying operations. 
VOCs can be released from the  heating  of the transport trough (after coating) and 
the plugging material (European Environmental Agency  2013 ). 
 The most abundant by-product from ironmaking in blast furnace is the slag 
which is then generally used as construction material or directly sent for landﬁ lling. 
The slag contains large quantities of unwanted impurities such as sulphur. The gen-
eration  rate of slag generally depends on the impurity content of the feed materials 
and is typically around 300 kg/t pig iron. 
 The blast furnace generates gas emissions mainly from the top where the blast 
furnace gas (top gas) is released. The blast furnace gas leaving the furnace top is hot, 
combustible and contains considerable dust. The size of the dust particles in the raw 
blast furnace gas ranges between several μm and about 6 mm. Multistage operations 
are employed for de-dusting. The ﬁ rst-stage dry cyclones or gravity dust catchers 
can remove over 60 % of the particles from the gas stream. Besides the dust, the 
blast furnace gas typically contains CO x (CO and smaller content of CO 2 ) of up to 
40 %, N 2 of 55–57 %, H 2 of 1–5 % and small amounts of other components such as 
VOCs, SO 2 and H 2 S with a typical heating value of 2.5–3.6 MJ/Nm 3 (Energetics

 2000 ). SO 2 and H 2 S are formed due to the sulphur content of coke and other materi-
als. In Europe, NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) countries and 
Japan, the sulphur content of coke charged to blast furnaces are generally 0.5–0.9, 
0.6–0.7 and 0.5–0.6 wt%, respectively (Babich et al.  2008 ). The cleaned blast fur-
nace gas is extensively used in blast furnace stoves to preheat the inlet air to supply 
hot air blast or for  heat  recovery to generate steam and electricity. 
19.4  Emission Abatement Measures 
 Commonly used emission abatement measures can be utilised in ironmaking pro-
cesses; however, some technologies are exclusively designed to ﬁ t the special 
requirements of ironmaking plants (mainly coking, sintering, pelletising and iron-
making blast furnaces). 
 Solid by-products from these plants, e.g. slag from blast furnaces, are treated 
and/or recycled by customised methods. Wastewater is processed in wastewater 
treatment plants prior to discharge to the environment. The measures for gas emis-
sion abatement include (1) primary measures aiming to prevent and minimise emis-
sions during the production processes and (2) secondary (end-of-pipe) measures 
applied to abate emissions after their generation. Generally, primary measures 
should be given more priority, but the related environmental, economic and techni-
cal aspects should be also taken into consideration. 
 The commonly used primary and secondary measures for gas emission abate-
ment in different production plants are depicted in Tables  19.2 and  19.3 .  Due to the 
 low  pollutant concentrations and huge amount of gases involved in these processes, 
the introduction of pollution control measures generally incurs high investment 
cost. Beside the measures listed in Tables  19.2 and  19.3 , there are also measures for 
comprehensive control of pollutants specially developed for sintering and pelletis-
ing processes. These measures include (1) for sintering (emission optimised sinter-
ing (EOS ® ) (Menad et al.  2006 ; Bolen  2014 ), low emission and energy optimised 
sintering process (LEEP) (Eisen et al.  2004 ), environmental process optimised sin-
tering (Eposint) (Alexander et al.  2007 )) and (2) for pelletising (LKAB KK4 (oper-
ating) and Essar Steel Minnesota (under construction) (Bolen  2014 )). Integrated 
‘co-control’ of multi-pollutants and energy consumption is believed to be more efﬁ -
cient than single measures. Environmental regulations are putting pressure on the 
iron and steel industry to develop more efﬁ cient emission control technologies.
19.5  Conclusions 
 Iron production processes (including sintering, pelletising, cokemaking and blast 
furnace ironmaking) release signiﬁ cant amounts of pollutant emissions to the air, 
water and soil. This work is focused on the pollutants emitted to the air including 
CO, SO 2 , nitrogen oxides (NO x ), acid gases (H 2 S, HCl, HF), polycyclic aromatic

 Heavy metals 
 Heavy metals signiﬁ cantly adhere to particulates which can be removed by PM removal devices such as wet scrubbers. Zn, 
Pb and Cd emissions are the main concerns in sinter plants. Mercury emission is of concern in pellet plants. Soluble oxidised 
mercury can be removed by wet scrubbers. Elemental mercury can be removed by activated carbon injection into the off gas 
duct followed by carbon particle capture by PM removal devices

hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dioxins and furans 
(PCDD/Fs), heavy metals and particulate matter (PM). Their effects on the environ-
ment and human health are summarised. The inputs and emission outputs for the 
above four iron production processes are also introduced, aiming to give readers the 
information on the sources and production mechanism of the major pollutants in 
each production process. Sintering contributes the largest share of most types of 
pollutant emissions among the iron production processes. Waste gases produced 
from the sintering bed reactions are the primary sources of emissions. Emissions 
from pellet plants are mainly generated during the thermal induration of green pel-
lets. Comparison of these two iron ore aggregation processes shows that pelletising 
generally emits much less NO x , SO 2 , CO, non-methane VOCs and PCDD/Fs but 
more heavy metals per unit mass of sinter or pellet product. Cokemaking is respon-
sible for severe emissions of H 2 S, SO 2 , NO x , CO, PM, VOCs and heavy metals from 
the coke oven batteries and coke quenching process. As to the blast furnace iron-
making process, tapping generates the primary emissions due to the contact of hot 
metal and slag with the air. Furtherly, the work describes the commonly used pri-
mary and secondary measures for gas emission abatement. More efﬁ cient and cost- 
saving measures and technological advances are required to respond to the increasing 
pressure from environment regulations.

CO2 Emission in China’s Iron and Steel 
Industry
Tingyu Zhu, Wenqing Xu, and Mingpan Shao
Abstract  CO emissions have become a serious problem in China because of the coun-
try’s heavy reliance on fossil fuels as an energy source. The iron and steel industries, the 
energy consumptions of which are high compared to the rest of the world, are con-
fronted with an increasing demand to reduce CO emissions. Data on CO emissions from 
iron and steel industries is a basic requirement for a certificate of CO reduction. By 
analyzing the production process and the influence factors of CO emissions during iron 
and steel production process, the scope of CO emissions were defined. Material Flow 
Analysis (MFA) was used to analyze carbon flow from iron and steel production pro-
cess, and the CO emissions of a typical enterprise were calculated. The existing process-
ing CO emissions reduction technologies were also analyzed, such as blast furnace top 
gas pressure recovery turbine (TRT), sintering waste heat power generation, converter 
low pressure saturated steam generation and so on. The technologies including blast 
furnace stock gas circulation technology, coke oven gas injection technology after 
reforming, carbon capture and storage technologies and so forth are considered to have 
a better prospect of application for CO emissions reduction.

20.1  Introduction
The world is experiencing a global warming as the prominent symbol of climate change; 
in the last 100 years, the global average surface temperature has increased by 0.74 °C 
(Change 2007). Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report 
indicated that atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increased from 0.0280 % before 
the industrial revolution to 0.0379 % (Change 2007) in 2005. The issue of climate 
change has become the focus of the international community; greenhouse gas emissions 
data is the basis for the allocation of emissions reduction task. Iron and steel industry is 
the third largest industry CO2 emissions source after thermal power and cement industry

in China. Due to the high ratio of iron and steel, low concentration degree of iron and 
steel industry, the small capacity of metallurgical equipment, etc., iron and steel industry 
CO2 emissions account for about 15 % of the national total emissions in China (Kim and 
Worrell 2002), far higher than 5–6 % of the world.
Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences was supported 
by the “Strategic Priority Research Program” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 
Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues. 190 procedures of 21 repre-
sentative steel enterprises with different size, region, production process and prod-
uct types were sampled and monitored. Based on the material flow analysis process 
and enterprise level, the carbon emissions calculation method was established, and 
the carbon emissions of process and enterprise level were calculated and obtained, 
which can provide guidance for the iron and steel emissions reduction.
20.2  Factors Affecting Carbon Emissions in Iron  
and Steel Industry
20.2.1  The Production Process
Typical iron and steel production process is shown in Fig. 20.1, including blast 
furnace-converter, scrap steel-electric furnace, direct reduction-electric furnace and 
smelting reduction-converter four kinds of the production process (Chu 2015).
Because of the difference in iron material, energy type, production process, 
equipment, crude steel production, and other aspects, the CO2 emissions are differ-
ent (Eggelston et al. 2006). The direct CO2 emissions from blast furnace-converter 
technology is 1.46 t/tsteel, from scrap steel-electric furnace technology is 0.08 t/
tsteel, from reduction-electric furnace technology is 0.7 t/tsteel, and from smelting 
reduction iron technology is 1.212 t/tsteel (Changqing et al. 2009).

20.2.2  Energy Structure
Coal is the main energy in China, accounts for about 70 % of the total energy of 
our country, much higher than the world’s 30 % (Jiang 2008). CO2 emissions of 
different kinds of energy are very wide; the coal required to obtain a unit of heat 
caused by CO2 emission is higher than that of oil and natural gas by 36 and 61 % 
(Zhuang 2008) respectively. In addition, iron and steel production consumes a lot 
of power, while Chinese power generation mainly depends on coal power, account-
ing for 80 % of Chinese total electricity, much higher than the world’s 40 % 
(Bureau 2010).
20.2.3  Energy Efficiency
Iron and steel production process produces much secondary energy sources, such as 
waste heat, residual pressure, and gas. Making full use of the secondary energy 
sources and improving the utilization rate of input carbon can directly or indirectly 
reduce the CO2 emissions of steel production. The total amount of waste heat gener-
ated per ton steel accounted for about 37 % of the energy consumption per ton of 
steel; the utilization rate of waste heat resource of foreign advanced iron and steel 
enterprises is more than 80 %, while the utilization rate of waste heat resources of 
large and medium iron and steel enterprises in China is 30–50 % (Jiuju 2009).
20.2.4  Production Equipment
Large-scale equipment has an advantage of advanced technology, high output, low 
cost, and so on, and can reduce the energy consumption of iron and steel production 
and CO2 emissions. The energy consumption of the dated production equipment is 
higher than that of the large-scale equipment of 10–15 %; material consumption  
is higher than 7–10 % (Feng et al. 2008).
20.2.5  Quality of Raw Material
Blast furnace iron-making is the largest process of CO2 emissions in blast furnace-­
converter technology, accounting for about 65 % of the total emissions of ton steel. 
Fine material is the foundation of energy saving. In order to reduce the emission of 
CO2 in blast furnace iron-making, the high quality of iron concentrate with high 
grade, low content of harmful impurities and high reduction of metallurgical reduc-
ing should be preferred. The iron-making theory and practice had shown that iron

ore grade on every 1  % increase, iron-making fuel ratio will decreased by  
1.5 %, tons of iron slag will reduce the amount of 30 kg (Feng et al. 2008).
20.2.6  Low Carbon Production Technology
At present, the USA, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and other developed 
countries and regions have begun to develop low carbon steel production technol-
ogy to reduce CO2 emissions in the production of steel (World Steel Association 
2010). The low carbon technology can be divided into two categories according to 
the reduction media category. One is based on carbon metallurgy of low carbon 
technology, including blast furnace top gas recycling, carbon capture technology 
(CCS), etc. Of which, the blast furnace top gas recycling technology can reduce 
CO2 emissions by 30 %; by CCS removal of CO2 can reduce emissions by 20–30 %. 
The other is based on non-carbon metallurgy in low carbon technology, mainly 
including reforming coke oven gas circulation, non-carbon iron alkali liquid leach-
ing, and thermoelectric solution.
20.3  Carbon Emissions in Iron and Steel Industry
In the national greenhouse gas inventories provided by IPCC, iron and steel produc-
tion includes two parts: steel and metallurgical coke production. In this chapter, the 
iron and steel production includes three parts: iron-making, steelmaking, and cast 
rolling.
CO2 emissions from iron and steel production include direct emissions, indirect 
emissions, and carbon offset; so the total amount of CO2 emissions can be calcu-
lated by the following equation:
	
TotalCO emissions
direct emissions
indirect emissions
carbon
2
=
+
−
offset 	
Figure 20.2 illustrates the system boundary of CO2 emissions in the iron and 
steel production process. Direct CO2 emissions are caused by the consumption of 
fossil fuel and raw material in the process of conduction. Fossil fuels include coal, 
coke, fuel oil, coke oven gas, blast furnace gas, converter furnace gas, and so on. 
Raw materials include iron ore, limestone, dolomite, dust (from sintering, blast fur-
nace iron-making, and converter furnace steelmaking), slag (from blast furnace iron 
making and converter furnace steelmaking), and so on. Indirect CO2 emissions are 
caused by other external processes, for the use of outsourcing power and the calci-
nation of some flux. The carbon offset come from the sales of byproducts and the 
self-generating electricity process.

20.3.1  Coke Oven Process
According to coke oven process, the carbon flow analysis is shown in Fig. 20.3.
Direct CO2 emission from coking process was analyzed by carbon flow and 
obtained by carbon element conservation, that is, input amount of carbon element 
minus the output amount of carbon element in products form, the reduced portions 
of carbon element is transformed to CO2 (the same principle as follow), that is:

The existing processing equipment for CO2 emissions reduction technology takes 
advantage of residual heat resources to generate electricity and to deduce the CO2 
emissions, such as blast furnace top gas pressure recovery turbine (TRT), sintering 
waste heat power generation, converter low-pressure saturated steam generation 
technology, and coke dry quenching technology. The iron and steel industry’s better

CO2 emissions reduction technology with good application prospect in the future 
are blast furnace stock gas circulation technology, coke oven gas injection technol-
ogy after reforming, H2/O2 smelting reduction technology, and carbon capture and 
storage techno­logies. According to the survey of IPCC and CCS, it can reduce 
20–40 % CO2 emissions to have a positive influence on slowing down the change of 
climatic. The CCS technology of China is on a start step, and most of them adopt 
burned trapping method; the use of industry is also mainly improving petroleum 
recovery efficient (Tom 2009).

 Abstract   This chapter describes the emission and control of primary particulate 
matter (PM) in iron and steelmaking plants. The organized and unorganized emis-
sion sources of total suspended particulates (TSP) are presented and their emission 
amounts are reported. Considering the increasingly strict environmental air quality 
requirements, the emissions of inhalable particles (PM 10 ) and ﬁ ne particles (PM 2.5 ) 
during the iron and steelmaking processes are further discussed. For a sustainable 
and green iron and steel production, effective dust removal technologies adopted at 
present and should be developed and promoted in the future are also presented in 
this chapter. 
21.1  Introduction of  Steel Production Process 
and Particle Emission 
 Modern steel production process includes several steps such as smelting iron ore in 
a blast furnace to produce pig iron, converting the hot metal to steel, casting molten 
steel slab into continuously cast bloom, and producing steel materials of different 
use through plastic deformation processes like rolling. In modern integrated steel-
works, the manufacturing process consists of sintering, coking, iron-making, steel-
making, and rolling, thus being a complex and lengthy production system.

 Concerning the source of dust in the steel industry, the smoke dust contained in 
exhaust gas expelled in chemical reactions such as sintering, coking, iron-making, 
steelmaking, and rolling process is regarded as the primary, followed by the exhaust 
gas from the combustion of fuels in the furnace. The smog particles are generally 
very small with particle sizes ranging from 0.01 to 1 μm, generated by condensation 
of gaseous substances produced by the molten material that volatilizes during the 
metallurgical and chemical processes. The third source is the dust distributed ran-
domly in processes like fuel transportation, stevedoring, and machining, of which 
the particle size is within the range 1–200 μm. The emission of smoke dust in steel

production process is illustrated in Fig.  21.1 , while statistics of smoke and dust 
emission sources in several steelworks are shown in Table  21.1 .
 Thus, smoke dust is produced all along the production process in steelworks. 
Pollutant sources are widely distributed, characterized by the emission of high 
quantity of dust-containing gas, the high concentration of dust in the emitted gas 
and a complex composition (Wang et al.  2014 ). During the process of smelting and 
machining, huge amounts of iron ore, fuel, and auxiliary materials are consumed. 
About 6–7 t of raw materials are consumed to produce 1 t of steel, and about 80 % 
of these raw materials are converted into waste (Yu et al.  2012 ). For example, in an 
enterprise producing a million tons of crude steel annually, about 8 billion m 3 of 
smoke with huge amounts of CO,  CO 2 , and SO 2 and 100,000 t of dust are produced 
annually only from the sintering, iron-making, and steelmaking procedures (Wang 
and Zhang  2006 ). 
21.2  Distribution of Particle Emission Sources in Steelworks 
 The primary sources of smoke dust in the steel production process are as follows. 
21.2.1  The  Sintering Procedure 
 The quantity of smoke dust produced during the sintering process is of around 
20–40 kg/t of agglomerate while the emission quantity is about 1.02 kg/t, represent-
ing about 40 % of the total emission in steel manufacturing (Shi et al.  2006 ). The 
sources of smoke dust during the sintering procedure are:

 1.  Preparation of raw  materials  . Namely, the dust produced during downloading, 
crushing, sieving, and transportation systems.  
 2.  Sintering of materials . Water rapidly evaporates when it is mixed with the mixed 
materials containing hot returning ore in the mixer by contact with the hot metal. 
This water vapor escapes with an enormous amount of dust, in the form of very 
humid exhaust gas with a high dust concentration.  
 3.  Sintering machine nosing . When the ignition is started, the drawing fan venti-
lates the chamber from the lower part of materials, thus initiating the combustion 
of the fuel contained in the sintering materials. As a result, the smoke produced 
by combustion contains a huge amount of smoke dust.  
 4.  Sintering machine tail . Dust is produced when the agglomerate is crushed by the 
single roll crusher. During this step, a huge amount of very hot dust-containing 
exhaust gas is produced when the agglomerate is ventilated and cooled by an 
annular cooler. 
 5.  Product size stabilization . The stabilization system includes crushing and multi-
stage screening, during which a huge amount of dust is produced.  
21.2.2  The  Coking Procedure 
 The quantity of smoke dust generated during the coking step is 4–13 kg/t of coke. 
The smoke dust emission quantity in this stage accounts for about 10 % of the total 
emissions in steelworks (You  2013 ). The smoke dust sources during the coking 
procedure are:
 1.  Coal loading  process . Since coal occupies the space in the carbonization cham-
ber during loading, and positive pressure is formed as a part of coal is burnt in 
the carbonization chamber, raw gas along with soot are pushed out from the coal- 
loading hole, contaminating the environment.  
 2.  Coking process . During this stage, the smoke mainly comes from the leakage of 
furnace bodies such as the furnace door, the coal-loading hole cover, and the 
ascension pipe cover. Smoke produced in this step is characterized by its wide 
distribution, being produced continuously and having a large contaminant 
range.   
 3.  Coke pushing process . The red hot coke shrinks and cracks when it is placed in 
contact with air due to its high surface area and high temperature. Thus, this 
oxidation and combustion process generates a strong convection movement of 
the surrounding air and produces a huge amount of smoke.  
 4.  Coke quenching process . During wet quenching process, a huge amount of 
smoke dust is discharged from the quenching tower top. Similarly, a huge amount 
of smoke dust is discharged from the dry quenching tank top and the coke outlet 
during the dry quenching process.  
 5.  Coke sieving and transportation . During this stage, a huge amount of dust is also 
produced. 
W. Sun et al.

359
21.2.3  The  Iron-Making Procedure 
 The quantity of smoke dust produced during the iron-making procedure ranges 
between 9 and 12 kg/t of steel. The smoke dust emission quantity in this stage rep-
resents about 15 % of the total emission quantity in steelworks. The smoke dust 
sources during the iron-making procedure are:
 1.  Ore tank and preparation of coal  powders . Iron-making raw material enters the 
blast furnace through the ore tank, conveyor belt, shale shaker, charging wagon, 
hoisting feeder storage, transportation, and loading system. Dust is also pro-
duced during the running of devices such as the charging machine and shale 
shaker. Additionally, coal is sprayed into the blast furnace after it is crushed and 
ground into powder, where the ball grinder and the hoists originate a huge 
amount of dust (Yang and Wu  2004 ). 
 2.  Blast furnace cast house . When iron is cast out, a huge amount of high- 
temperature smoke containing dust is produced at the tapping hole, skimmer, 
trough and slag spout, as well as when the pig iron is loaded into a hot metal 
ladle and the tapping hole is opened.  
 3.  Hot-blast stove discharge . Smoke is produced during combustion occurred in the 
regenerator. 
21.2.4  The  Steelmaking Procedure 
 The quantity of smoke dust produced during the manufacturing of steel procedure 
is of about 10–20 kg/t of steel, which correspond to about 20 % of the total emission 
quantity in steelworks (Jia  2012 ). The sources of smoke dust during the steelmaking 
procedure are:
 1.  Pouring and pretreatment of molten iron . When molten iron is poured from the 
molten iron car or torpedo car into the pretreatment tank, slag is skimmed, and 
sulfur is removed from the molten iron. During this step, a huge amount of dust- 
containing high-temperature smoke is produced.  
 2.  Primary smoke . A huge amount of dust-containing smoke is produced during 
blowing in the converter, melting in an electric arc furnace or the oxidation 
stage. 
 3.  Secondary smoke . A huge amount of dust-containing smoke is produced due to 
molten steel spraying during hot metal pouring, loading of materials, blowing, 
slag tapping, and steel tapping procedures.  
 4.  Reﬁ ning . During the reﬁ ning process of molten steel, slag residue and alloy are 
added according to the process requirements. Thus, physical changes and chem-
ical reactions can take place, producing a huge amount of dust-containing 
smoke.

21.3  Intensity of  Smoke and Dust Emission in Steelworks 
 Thermal power generation and steel industry are great particle emission hosts. 
Currently, the particle size distribution before and after the dust precipitator for the 
boiler in a coal-ﬁ red power plant is studied by researchers all over the world, as well 
as the classiﬁ cation efﬁ ciency of dust removal (Lighty et al.  2000 ; Kauppinen and 
Kappanen  1990 ). As has been previously described, the production procedures in 
the steel industry are fairly complicated, and particles generate in each production 
stage, with contaminant sources distributed rather widely. Thus, a systematic and 
thorough study on particle emission characteristics in steelworks is very difﬁ cult. 
Therefore, neither studies about the particle size distribution before and after the 
dust precipitator in steelworks, nor the classiﬁ cation efﬁ ciency of dust precipitators 
is frequently reported. 
 Emission factors including  TSP ,  PM 10 , and PM 2. 5 in steelworks from China, 
USA, and EU are given in Table  21.2 (Ma  2009 ). According to these data, it is 
clear that even if TSP emission during each production procedures is well charac-
terized for steelworks in the different countries, very little is known about the 
differentiation of the corresponding particle emissions regarding PM 10 and PM 2.5 
fractions.
 Figures  21.2 ,  21.3 , and  21.4 show the comparison of the emission factors of TSP, 
PM 10 , and PM 2.5 in steelworks from China, USA, and EU. According to the data 
presented in these ﬁ gures, smoke dust emission factors of Chinese steelworks are 
higher than those of the USA and EU in all the production stages. There are several 
reasons that may inﬂ uence the value of such emission factors, including differences 
in the production processes in steelworks, in the production techniques or terminal 
management technologies, etc.
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has organized sub-
stantial measurements against contaminant sources and published the handbook of 
air contaminant emission factors (AP-42) (USEPA 1996) on this basis. AP-42 sum-
marizes the vast majority of anthropogenic contaminant source emission factors and 
describes the main emission processes. Emission coefﬁ cients in AP-42 are classiﬁ ed 
into ﬁ ve levels like A, B, C, D, and E according to their reliability and accuracy 
levels. Thus, the classiﬁ cation standard is deﬁ ned so that when the same measure-
ment technique is employed, the emission coefﬁ cients based on measuring at least 
10 contaminant sources is regarded as level A, whereas the emission coefﬁ cients 
based on measuring fewer contaminant sources are regarded as level  B . Emission 
coefﬁ cients based on survey and collection or derived from emission coefﬁ cients of 
other processes similar to the contaminant emission processes are regarded as levels 
C, D, and E. 
 Table  21.3 lists the optimal practical smoke dust puriﬁ cation techniques applied 
by steelworks in EU and their environmental beneﬁ ts.
 Table  21.4 shows the production procedures, emission sources, and data corre-
sponding to the emission factors of integrated steelworks given by “Best Available 
Techniques Reference Document on the Production of Iron and Steel.”

21 Particulate Matter Emission in Iron and Steelmaking Plants

 China’s “Industrial pollution source discharge coefﬁ cient manual of the ﬁ rst 
national pollution source census” gives the most comprehensive data of the  country’s 
smoke dust emission in the steel industry. However, the data are obtained based on 
the emission level in 2007. 
 According to references from countries all over the world, few studies on  PM 10 
and PM 2.5 produced during each procedure in steelworks are reported, so it is difﬁ -
cult to obtain detailed data and information. Therefore, ﬁ eld research of steelworks 
is necessary to gain a more comprehensive knowledge about the smoke dust emis-
sion in steelworks.

Along with the advance of dust removal techniques, multiple removal measures 
occur. Meanwhile, the removal efﬁ ciency is improved obviously and reached 99 % 
or more for some dust precipitators.

 The  gas–solid or liquid–solid separation mechanisms based on two mobile 
phases are employed in dust removal techniques to capture solid or liquid particles 
in gas. In industry, there are many frequently used dust precipitators, which can be 
classiﬁ ed as the mechanical precipitator, wet precipitator, electrostatic precipitator, 
ﬁ ltration collector, and electrostatic precipitation-bag ﬁ ltration comprehensive dust 
collector according to the capturing mechanism.

21.4.1  Mechanical Precipitator 
 Mechanical precipitator   separates particles from air ﬂ ow and makes them pre-
cipitate by effects such as gravity, inertia, and centrifugation. It can be classiﬁ ed 
as gravity settling chamber, inertia dust precipitator and cyclone dust precipita-
tor, etc. Mechanical precipitator, with an efﬁ ciency of generally between 40 and 
90 %, is a kind of standard dust removal equipment, and is characterized by sim-
ple, less investment, convenient operation, and low power consumption. However, 
due to the small dust removal efﬁ ciency, they are usually  applied to pretreating 
the dust only. The application of cyclone precipitator is the widest among them 
(Chen  2006 ).

21.4.2  Wet Dust Precipitator 
 Wet dust precipitator is a device in which exhaust gas containing dust touches either 
water or other solutions, and particles are separated from the exhaust gas by wash-
ing, adsorption, and inertial impaction effects caused by the liquid layer, liquid 
drop, and liquid membrane. According to the puriﬁ cation mechanism, wet dust pre-
cipitators can be classiﬁ ed into seven types: wet cyclone precipitator, wet foam 
precipitator, self-excited spraying wet precipitator, packed bed wet precipitator, 
gravity spraying wet precipitator, mechanical induced spraying wet precipitator, 
and Venturi wet precipitator (Yuan and Wang  2011 ). 
 Wet dust precipitators have advantages of simple structure, low cost, safe run-
ning, and high dust removal efﬁ ciency. They can not only be applied to treating 
dust-containing gas with high temperature, high humidity, high speciﬁ c resistance, 
and high ﬂ ammability, but also to removing hazardous materials in the exhaust gas. 
However, wet dust precipitators also have the following disadvantages: the power 
consumption is high; the waste liquid touched with exhaust gas easily leads to sec-
ondary pollution; gas containing fog drops may cause the device corrosion or scal-
ing; lowered quality of the exhaust gas and waste of the power resource; also, when 
wet dust precipitators are employed in cold areas, freezing may occur. 
21.4.3  Electrostatic Precipitator 
 An electrostatic precipitator is a dust removal device in which the electric ﬁ eld is formed 
by high voltage imposed between the discharge electrode and the dust collection plate. 
When the dust-containing gas comes through the electric ﬁ eld, the dust particles are 
electriﬁ ed and precipitated on the dust collection plate due to the effect of the electric 
ﬁ eld force. Compared with other dust removal mechanisms, the separation force in the 
electric dust removal process is directly imposed on particles rather than on the whole 
airﬂ ow. Thus, this method has the advantages of high dust removal efﬁ ciency, low 
power consumption, low airﬂ ow resistance, and large smoke treatment quantity. 
Additionally, it can be applied to capturing particles at the sub- micro level (0.1 μm) and 
be controlled by a micro-computer in remote operation. This measure has been widely 
used in industrial departments like electricity, cement, and metallurgy (Wei  2000 ). 
 However, electrostatic precipitators have the disadvantages of requiring a high 
initial investment, large space occupation, and a high cost of operation and manage-
ment. It is not suitable to purify gas with high dust concentration directly by elec-
trostatic precipitator because dust-containing exhaust gas with high-temperature 
loads stable corona charges only at high voltage conditions. There are also some 
other challenges in using electrostatic precipitators, such as insulation, electrode 
corrosion, and sensitivity to characteristics like dust particular resistance and gas 
composition. Moreover, using electrostatic precipitators calls for a very high quality 
of manufacture and installation, in which high voltage transformer and rectiﬁ er con-
trol devices are indispensable. 
21 Particulate Matter Emission in Iron and Steelmaking Plants

21.4.4  Filtration Collector 
 Filtration collector is a dust removal device in which dust-containing airﬂ ow comes 
through the ﬁ ltration material, and dust is thus separated and captured. Bag style 
dust collector is a typical representative of ﬁ ltration collector and applied most 
widely. Materials like cotton, wool, or man-made ﬁ bers are handled to textile and 
then used as ﬁ ltering media in bag style dust collector to ﬁ lter dust-containing gas. 
The ﬁ ltration bag blocks particles in the smoke when the dust-containing gas passes 
the pores of ﬁ ltering media, whereas clean airﬂ ow comes through the ﬁ ltration bag 
and is discharged. Dust precipitated on the ﬁ ltration bag is then detached from the 
ﬁ ltering media surface using back ﬂ ushing or vibration and then falls into the ash 
bucket. Since the blocked particles in smoke form a pancake ﬁ ltering layer at the 
tiny meshes on the ﬁ ltration bag surface (it seems like a “bridging” phenomenon), 
ﬁ ne particles can be ﬁ ltered effectively when the exhaust gas passes the pancake 
ﬁ ltering layer. Thus, the dust removal efﬁ ciency of bag style collector can reach 
higher than 99 %, making bag style collector the most widely used dust removal 
method at present. The advantages of bag style dust collector include stable running 
performance, simple operation and maintenance, and multiple functions of captur-
ing various dry clouds of dust. However, it has disadvantages such as a narrowly 
applicable temperature range. Also, phenomena like bag burning and break are easy 
to occur when the collector is employed to ﬁ lter high-temperature smoke (Zhang 
and Li  2005 ). 
 The steel industry is a critical particle emission host. Particle treatment in steel 
industry must follow the comprehensive treatment principle. Reduction of power 
and resource consumption is one of the fundamental means to lessen the particle 
emission. This process should be improved, and advanced production devices 
should be employed to reduce the production of particles in the manufacturing 
 process. Efﬁ cient dust removal devices should be applied so as to improve the treat-
ment, recycling, and reuse of particles. 
 Steelworks adopt the corresponding control  measures against the primary con-
taminant sources of particles. Detailed information is given in Table  21.5 .
21.5  Development Directions of Particle Emission Control 
in Steelworks 
 Currently, the study of ﬁ ne particle control technique in the world can be classiﬁ ed 
in two directions. One studies on efﬁ cient dust removal technologies, including the 
development of efﬁ cient dust precipitators and improvement of traditional dust pre-
cipitators. The other is the study of the aggregation techniques of ﬁ ne particles, 
including applying external effects like electric ﬁ eld and magnetic ﬁ eld and adding 
chemical nucleating agents to aggregate ﬁ ne particles to large particles. 
W. Sun et al.

21.5.1  Efﬁ cient Dust Removal Techniques 
 1.  Electrostatic precipitation-bag style ﬁ ltration comprehensive dust collector . 
Electrostatic precipitation-bag style ﬁ ltration integral dust collector is a new dust 
removal method based on two developed dust removal theories (electrostatic 
dust removal and bag style dust removal). Electrostatic-bag style dust collector 
can be classiﬁ ed into three types according to composition style, as for 
electrostatic- back bag style, electrostatically enhanced the style and electrostatic- 
bag integrated style. The advantages of electrostatic precipitator and bag style 
dust collector such as high dust removal efﬁ ciency and excellent running reli-
ability are integrated into electrostatic-bag style dust collector. However, consid-
ering that the coordination between the electrostatic collection zone and the bag 
ﬁ ltration zone can hardly be maintained for a long time, the application of 
this technique is limited. Until now, the electrostatic-back bag style has been

employed in several coal-ﬁ red power plants with removal efﬁ ciency of higher 
than 99.9 %. However, since basic research is not sufﬁ cient, yet many critical 
problems have not been solved, so the running of dust collectors is still not stable 
enough. 
 2.  Electrostatic cyclone dust  collector . In electrostatic cyclone dust collector, 
cyclone capturing technique and electrostatic capturing technique are integrated 
organically. Dust is separated in the collector due to the effect of centrifugation 
as well as electrostatic force. Big particle size dust is captured by the cyclone 
effect whereas ﬁ ne dust is captured by an electrostatic force ﬁ eld, and ﬁ xtures on 
the wall are cleared by the rapid spinning airﬂ ow which causes a ﬂ ushing effect 
on the wall and collision effect between dust particles. Due to the advantages 
such as simple structure, low running cost, and high dust removal efﬁ ciency, 
electrostatic cyclone dust collector has been studied by many researchers in pre-
vious years. However, this technique remains at the mechanism exploring and 
performance research stage and has not been applied to industry at present.  
 3.  Electrostatic particle layer dust collector . In electrostatic particle layer dust col-
lector, an external electric ﬁ eld is imposed on the space in particle layer dust 
collector, which charges dust particles or ﬁ ltering media. Thus, the particle coag-
ulation and the ﬁ ltration effect of particle layer are promoted, improving the 
removal efﬁ ciency of ﬁ ne dust particles. Electrostatic particle layer dust collec-
tor has the advantages such as high-temperature resistance and high dust removal 
efﬁ ciency while the disadvantages of the system include rather high resistance, 
low ﬁ ltration rate, and complicated dust cleaning procedure. Limited by the 
above  factors , this technique remains at the experimental study stage. 
21.5.2  Fine Particle Coagulation Techniques 
 1.  Electrostatic coagulation . In the electrostatic coagulation process, due to differ-
ent moving rate and direction, the dust particles collide one with each other and 
then nucleation occurs under the effect of the electrostatic force. The result of 
electrostatic coagulation depends on dust concentration, particle size, charge dis-
tribution, and the intensity of the external electric ﬁ eld. Based on the electro-
static coagulation mechanism, Australia Indigo Technology Co. Ltd. has 
developed the Indigo coagulation collector. The Indigo coagulation collector 
integrates the electrostatic effect and ﬂ owing process, which makes ﬁ ne particles 
entering the collector adhere to larger particles, improving the ﬁ ne particle 
removal efﬁ ciency of a traditional dust collector. This device has been employed 
by several countries in the world and has achieved favorable results.  
 2.  Sound coagulation . In sound coagulation process, a high-frequency sound wave 
is applied to making the relative motion of ﬁ ne aerosol particles so that the col-
lision frequency in unit time is increased and ﬁ ne particles are coagulated to 
large particles during a very short period. The removal efﬁ ciency of ﬁ ne particles 
by the traditional dust collector can be improved by the sound coagulation effect. 
W. Sun et al.

371
Researchers from Southeast University, China, have intensely studied the kinetic 
characteristics and coagulation result of combustion-produced inhalable particu-
late matters under external sound ﬁ eld and obtained some innovative results. 
However, the application of this technique to industry is limited because of the 
high power consumption the lack of sound sources suitable for long-term use in 
high temperature, and the dusty environment.  
 3.  Magnetic coagulation . Magnetic coagulation means the magnetized particles 
move against each other under the effects like magnetic dipole force and mag-
netic ﬁ eld gradient force, and then they coagulate with each other so that the 
particle granularity increases. After that, the coagulated particles are removed by 
a traditional dust collector. Fine particle removal efﬁ ciency of the traditional dust 
collector is thus improved. Until now, few studies on magnetic coagulation of 
ultraﬁ ne particles are reported, indicating the initial stage of research. 
  4.  Chemical  coagulation . Chemical coagulation means promoting the ﬁ ne particle 
removal by adding chemical coagulation promotion agent. The main mechanism 
is the combination of physical adsorption and chemical reaction. According to the 
difference of adding the position of chemical coagulation promotion agent, this 
technique can be divided into chemical coagulation during combustion and 
chemical coagulation after combustion. Until now, few studies on chemical coag-
ulation are reported. The existing few studies mainly focus on ﬁ ne particle coagu-
lation by usual substances like kaolinite and bauxite. Chemical coagulation is 
very effective in removing ﬁ ne particles, and it can eliminate multi-contaminants 
simultaneously.  
21.6  Suggestions on  Smoke Dust Pollution Control 
in Steelworks 
  Promoting the Application of Advanced Dust Removal Techniques   Reformation and 
consummation of environmental protection devices require a substantial capital 
investment, environmental protection investment per ton of steel in steelworks differs 
obviously in different countries. Therefore, steelworks in developing countries should 
further increase the environmental protection investment. Additionally, they should 
promote the application of advanced techniques such as stock yard dust inhibition, 
blast furnace gas dust removal by the dry process, converter gas dust removal by dry 
method, and coke dry quenching, so as to reduce the emission quantity of smoke dust.  
 Speed Up the Elimination of Backward Capacity   Eliminating the backward capac-
ity is the most direct measure for steelworks to reduce smoke dust emission. China’s 
“National power saving and emission reduction planning during the 12th ﬁ ve-year” 
points that the steel industry needs to eliminate 48 million tons of backward iron- 
making capacity and 48 million tons of backward steelmaking capacity. Until now, 
several steelworks in China have not yet eliminated much backward capacity on 
time, so they should quicken the elimination steps.  
21 Particulate Matter Emission in Iron and Steelmaking Plants

372
 Developing Fine Particle Control Techniques   Along with the increasingly improve-
ment of environmental protection standards in countries worldwide, seeking high 
total dust removal efﬁ ciency only cannot meet the requirements of environmental 
protection. Low-cost efﬁ cient dust removal techniques and ﬁ ne particle coagulation 
techniques should be developed, which is an important developing direction for 
future steelworks to control the smoke dust pollution. This will improve the ﬁ ltra-
tion accuracy and capturing efﬁ ciency of ﬁ ne particles.

Abstract  Iron and steel manufacturing is one of the most energy-intensive and CO2 
emitting industries in the world. In order to contribute to the prevention of global 
warming, the reduction of CO2 from the steel works becomes a major issue imposed 
on the steel industry. A number of technologies have been developed in the past 
decade under worldwide CO2 breakthrough program for the reduction of carbon 
emissions. This chapter focuses on present needs, recent progress, and future trends 
of energy efficient new iron and steelmaking technologies. This study presents a com-
parative analysis of CO2 breakthrough programs including the present technological 
development and effects of application, economic feasibility, and environmental 
impact assessment. In addition, a brief analysis on ULCOS innovative ironmaking 
technologies has been done. Finally, significant CO2 reductions can be achieved by 
combining a number of the available energy efficient technologies with Bio-CCS.
22.1  Introduction
The iron and steel manufacturing is one of the most energy- and carbon-intensive 
industries in the world. Iron and steelmaking processes are still mostly coal-based 
and thus highly dependent on fossil fuels, releasing substantial amount of fossil CO2 
(Abbasi et al. 2015). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), the steel industry accounts for 6 % of the total world CO2 emission.

International Energy Agency (IEA) reported CO2 emissions from manufacturing 
industry account for approximately 40 % of the total CO2 emissions worldwide and 
iron and steel manufacturing industry contributes the biggest share of around 27 % 
of the global manufacturing sectors (Kasahara et al. 2012).
However, steel is considered to be one of the most important and useful metals in 
the world, and it continues to be the dominant material in global metal production. 
Therefore, controlling and reducing CO2 emissions from this industry is now a 
pressing issue (Lin and Wang 2015). Over the last decade, a number of researches 
and development initiatives around the world under the ‘CO2 breakthrough 
Programs’ (ULCOS,1 AISI,2 POSCO,3 COURSE50,4 etc.) have been investigated 
for carbon-free green and sustainable iron and steel production. The target is to 
develop CO2 breakthrough technologies in combination with top gas recycling for 
the blast furnace (TGR-BF), direct reduction (DR) with electric arc furnace (EAF), 
iron ore electrolysis also called electro-winning (EW), carbon capture and seques-
tration (CCS) by using fossil fuels, biomass, hydrogen, and electricity as innovative 
reducing agents for the reduction process. Among all of these research programs, 
the Ultra-low CO2 Steelmaking (ULCOS) is the most extensive research program 
with big budget. It is a consortium of 48 European companies and organizations 
from 15 European countries and is supported by European Commission. ULCOS 
consists of all major European Union steel plants, engineering partners, research 
institutes, and universities. It is divided into two phases: ULCOS I in 2004 and 
ULCOS II in 2010. It is proactively looking for solutions to the threat of global 
warming. The main aim of this massive project is to reduce CO2 emission by at least 
50 %, i.e., to reduce CO2 emission from 2 t CO2 per ton steel to 1 t CO2 per ton steel 
production (Birat 2009a, b). In addition, for large scale industrial production it will 
develop potential and feasible ultra-low CO2 steel production technologies that 
must be sustainable, i.e. environmentally friendly, economically viable, and socially 
acceptable.
This chapter illustrates the current development and future prospect of world-
wide CO2 breakthrough ironmaking technologies. This chapter, hopefully, will be 
useful for engineers, researchers, steel companies, policy makers, investors, and 
other interested parties to build sustainable green iron and steel industry.
22.2  Key Challenges for CCS Implement in Iron 
and Steel Industry
Having known the increasing importance of the development and deployment of 
CCS technology into the iron and steel industry, a large number of studies have 
focused on various issues. For instance, a technology strategy for reducing CO2 
1 ULCOS = Ultra-Low CO2 Steelmaking (EU).
2 AISI = American Iron and Steel Institute with technology roadmap programme.
3 POSCO = CO2 Breakthrough Framework (Korea).

emissions, socio-technical analysis, techno-economic and scenario assessment, 
hydrogen-­based steelmaking, using biomass, technology selection, chemical 
absorption process modeling, physical adsorption process modeling and simulation 
with environmental impact assessment have been undertaken with respect to the 
implementation of different emerging ironmaking technologies with CCS. From 
these studies, and the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Program (IEA Greenhouse Gas 
R&D Programme) and CO2 breakthrough program (i.e. ULCOS, AISI, POSCO, 
COURSE50, etc.), we can summarize some of the key challenges to the develop-
ment of the CO2 capture technologies for the iron and steel industry:
–– to handle impurities, other than CO2 in the flue gas stream;
–– unlike power plants, where CO2 is emitted from a single source, an integrated 
steel mill has multiple sources of CO2 emissions from several stacks and occurs 
from the start to the end of iron and steel production;
–– cost competitive and energy efficient CO2 capture methods and processes;
–– efficient, permanent, and cost-effective storage;
–– effective design and operation of CO2 transport systems; and
–– implementation of CCS in steel production that requires a worldwide solution 
that would offer a level playing field—which is critical to make CCS in the iron 
and steel industry workable.
22.3  CO2 Emission Sources in the Iron and Steel Industry
An integrated iron and steel mill consists of a number of complex series of intercon-
nected plants, in which emissions are produced from many sources (10 or more) 
(Birat and Maizière lès Metz 2010). Large amounts of CO2 are produced by the 
reduction reaction in the blast furnace and the combustion reaction of carbonaceous 
materials (coke breeze, etc.) and carbon-containing gases, such as blast furnace gas 
(B gas) and coke oven gas (C gas) in the sintering machine, coke ovens, and hot 
stoves. Thus, iron oxides are chemically converted into molten iron (Fe), which 
produces massive amounts of CO2 and carbon monoxide (CO) as a by-product gas 
or blast furnace gas (BFG). The basic chemistry of the ironmaking processes is 
listed as the following equations (Germeshuizen and Blom 2013):

There are mainly eight direct emission points of sources grouped into two sec-
tions: (1) iron production (i.e., power plant stack, COG, blast furnace stoves, sin-
ter plant stack, and lime kiln stack) and (2) steel production (i.e., BOF stack, hot 
strip mill stack, plate mill stack). The composition and volume of the exhaust 
gases for each emission point of the sources are different (Hasanbeigi et al. 2014; 
Ho et al. 2013). The proportion of CO2 in flue gases (such as CO2, N2, O2, H2O, H2 
CO, CH4, SOx, NOx) is different, based on the applied emerging technologies in 
the different routes of iron and steel production. Furthermore, other impurities 
that affect the capture process are also different in terms of CO2 capture perfor-
mance. Therefore, during the reducing process of pig iron production CO2 tech-
nologies have to be implemented by the properties of the flue gases (Choi 2013) 
shown in Fig. 22.1.

22.4  CO2 Breakthrough Programs
A number of programs along with ULCOS as a part of WorldSteel CO2 break-
through program and international Iron & Steel Association are working together to 
exchange knowledge and information for sustainable green iron and steel manufac-
turing. Extensive researches and investment are taking place in:
• The EU (ultra-low CO2 steelmaking, or ULCOS I and ULCOS II)
• The USA (American Iron and Steel Institute)
• Canada (Canadian Steel Producers Association)
• Australia (BlueScope Steel/One Steel CSIRO coordination)
• South America (ArcelorMittal Brazil)
• Japan (Japanese Iron and Steel Federation)
• Korea (POSCO)
• China (Baosteel) and Taiwan (China Steel) and
COURSE 50 is a national CO2 breakthrough program in Japan led by the Japan 
Iron and Steel Federation (JISF). It aims to decrease CO2 emissions by around 30 % 
through suppression of CO2 emissions from blast furnaces besides capture—separa-
tion and recovery of CO2 from blast furnace gas (BFG) by launching a new amine 
scrubbing technology. The ready to use technology concepts would be available by 
2030 and the final goal of industrializing and transferring the developed technolo-
gies by 2050. Moreover, POSCO (Pohang Iron and Steel Company) has also been 
developing an ammonia-based scrubbing CCS technology for the adaption to the 
FINEX and to the COREX processes (Birat 2010).
The USA started AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) CO2 breakthrough 
program organized by some top universities in the USA to promote carbon reduc-
tion in steel industry. It includes the use of several kinds of clean energy and 
­development of CO2 capture and separation technology. For example, high tempera-
ture electrolysis was examined at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 
hydrogen reduction of iron ore in the laboratory, preparatory to transposing to a 
flash furnace reactor at Utah University, mineral sequestration at Columbia 
University, and CO2 collection from EAF fumes using lime at Missouri Rolla 
University. According to the AISI CO2 Breakthrough Program, two innovative tech-
nologies have been identified to cut CO2 emissions: (1) Molten Oxide Electrolysis 
(MOE)—Reduction of iron ore through electrolysis. (2) Hydrogen Flash Smelting—
Reduction of iron ore in a suspension, with hydrogen as a reducing agent (Table 22.1).

However, Canadian program, run by Canadian Steel Producers Association 
(CSPA) and Arcelor Brazil separately has been developing biomass-based steel pro-
duction. There are also ongoing programs in Australia (such as Bluescope + OneSteel 
consortium) and Taiwan (China Steel) which are either ambitious in terms of miti-
gation level or still at a conceptual level in academic work carried out in universi-
ties. Timeline of these programs is not published except ULCOS and COURSE-50. 
Besides, what is happening in China about CO2 breakthrough program is not 
described clearly and India has decided to participate with the program, but not yet 
physically contributed (Chen et al. 2012).
All of these programs are similar to ULCOS program but they are less advanced 
in terms of developing breakthrough technologies and their progresses are not yet 
widely reported. A brief comparison among worldwide major CO2 breakthrough 
programs is given in Table 22.2.
22.4.1  Ultra-Low Carbon Dioxide Steelmaking (ULCOS) 
Program
The EU CO2 breakthrough program, ULCOS proposed a concept in terms of CO2 
breakthrough technologies as shown in Fig. 22.2. This triangle matrix explains how 
reducing agents and fuels can be selected from three possibilities such as carbon, 
hydrogen, and electrons. The mock ternary diagram represents all existing energy 
sources where coal is near to carbon on the carbon-hydrogen line, natural gas is near 
to hydrogen, and hydrogen from electrolysis of water is on the hydrogen-electricity 
line, etc.
The existing steel technologies are based on fossil fuels, i.e. mostly on carbon, 
natural gas, mix of carbon and hydrogen, and electric arc furnaces are shown in red 
boxes in Fig. 22.2. On the other hand, for CO2 lean process routes, ULCOS has 
identified three major ways of solutions: (1) decarbonizing whereby coal would be 
replaced by hydrogen or electricity in hydrogen reduction or electrolysis of iron ore 
processes (2) CCS technology introduction, and (3) use of sustainable biomass are 
presented in yellow boxes in the diagram.
22.4.2  ULCOS CO2 Breakthrough Technologies
From the beginning quite a few breakthrough technologies for the reduction of CO2 
emissions from iron and steelmaking industry have been investigated in the context 
of Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking (ULCOS) program. Finally, ULCOS has selected 
four process concepts that could lead to a drastic reduction of CO2 emissions by 
more than 50 % compared to the present best practices. Those four cutting-edge 
technologies are: (1) Top Gas Recycling Blast Furnace with CO2 Capture and

Storage (CCS), (2) HIsarna with CCS, (3) ULCORED with CCS, and (4) 
Electrolysis. Additionally, hydrogen-based steelmaking and the use of biomass as 
reducing agent have been evaluated as supporting technology to decrease CO2 emis-
sions (Birat et al. 2010).
The ULCOS experiment and program structure has been illustrated in Fig. 22.3. 
The key strategies of ULCOS have been included in this program as described 
below.

22.4.2.1  ULCOS Blast Furnace Process (SP1 & SP2)
Blast Furnace (BF) is the most energy consuming process in integrated steel plants. 
So it is essential to reduce fossil CO2 emissions from this process. ULCOS has 
invented top gas recycling blast furnace (TGR-BF) is a blast furnace gas separation 
technology for clean steel production. Top gas used to absorb CO2 inside blast fur-
nace acts as a reducing agent. It effectively reduces carbon emission around 50 %. 
The integrated use of TGR-BF and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies is 
helpful to remove nitrogen from the TGR-BF and oxygen injection into BF can also 
effectively recover CO2. After extraction of CO2 from recycled gas by using VPSA 
CCS technology, the cryogenic technique is applied to store. The following three 
different versions were tested:
• Version 4, the treated is a recycled gas in the main tuyeres and additional tuyeres 
located in lower stack at 12,500 and 9000 °C, respectively. The expected carbon 
saving is 26 %.
• Version 3, the treated gas is recycled through the main tuyeres only and expected 
carbon saving is 24 %.
• Version 1 has the same flow sheet like version 4 but the recycled gas is cold and 
expected carbon saving is 22 %.

In 2007 the first experiment was successfully done at LKAB’s Experimental Blas 
Furnace (EBF) in Lulea, Sweden and it ran efficiently with high thermal stability, 
including up to 24 % CO2 reduction. After this for the second phase ULCOS 2, EU 
invested hundreds of million euros for the promotion and planning of TRG-BF. It 
was successful, this technology will hopefully mitigate CO2 emission of almost 
1.5 Mt per year, i.e. about 1/3 for a BF (Fig. 22.4).
22.4.2.2  HIsarna Smelter
The HIsarna process is based on a modified version of the HIsmelt smelter technol-
ogy. It is a concept using a combination of three new ironmaking technologies: (a) 
coal preheating and partial pyrolysis in a reactor, (b) melting cyclone for ore melt-
ing, and (c) melter vessel for final ore reduction and iron production.
HIsarna is a bath-smelting technology that combines coal preheating and partial 
pyrolysis in a reactor. It uses a smelter vessel for final ore reduction and a melting 
cyclone for ore smelting. By removing sintering and coking processes it reduces 
CO2 emission. Moreover, by using biomass or natural gas instead of coal, process-

382
ing combustion gases, storing CO2, and recycling heat energy, HIsarna technology 
reduces almost 70 % CO2 emission [45]. The benefits of the HIsarna process are
• Reduction of the CO2 emissions per ton with 20 %
• Reduction of the CO2 emissions per ton with 80 % if the process is combined 
with CCS
• Elimination of coke and sinter/pellet plant emissions
• Use of non-coking coal qualities
• Use of low cost iron ores, outside the blast furnace quality range
• Economically attractive even at small unit size (0.8–1.2 M thm/y)
A pilot plant of this technology was set up by TATA Iron and Steel Group of 
European Companies in Holland IJmuiden in September 2010 with 65 kt annual 
outputs under ULCOS II project Design output of TATA Steel HIsarna pilot plant is 
8 t/h of hot metal. Ore and coal injection capacity is 8 and 15 t/h, respectively. 
However, if it is going to be successful, the technology will be used at a commercial 
level after 10–20 years (Fig. 22.5).
22.4.2.3  Direct-Reduced Iron with Natural Gas (ULCORED) (SP3)
The project ULCORED is built up for iron ore pretreatment especially for sintering 
and preheating. To produce direct-reduced iron (DRI) for sending to electric arc 
furnace (EAF) the reducing agent such as natural gas or biomass gas is used in a 
reactive level for the iron ore sintering process. In gas purification process tradi-
tional reducing agent is replaced by natural gas. Top gas recycling and preheating 
processes reduce natural gas consumption (Fig. 22.6). Using this technology, we 
can reduce 60 % CO2 emission and also it is an economical and efficient process 
since natural gas is expensive.

22.4.2.4  Direct Electrolysis of Iron Ore (ULCOwin & ULCOlysis) (SP5)
The principle of the direct electrolysis of iron ore has been applied in ULCOWIN 
project, whose products are iron and oxygen with zero carbon emission. The 
ULCOWIN technology is different from other conventional smelting process which 
employs a new method for steel production. Its reaction temperature is around 
110 °C where iron ore and iron are used as an anode and cathode precipitation, 
respectively. Electrolysis of iron ore does not emit CO2 (Fig. 22.7).
Although its initial production rate is very low efficiency production efficiency, 
only 5 kg iron per day, but its cost is reasonable. Hence, the ULCOS team devel-
oped a process named ULCOLYSIS for melting iron ore at 16,000 °C by using 
electric direct reduction. This is the least developed technology in contrast with 
other three alternatives.

22.4.2.5  Hydrogen-Based Steelmaking (SP4)
By hydrogen-based steelmaking route, CO2 emissions would be reduced by more 
than 80 %. Hydrogen steelmaking will depend profoundly on the availability of 
green hydrogen. It can be generated from natural gas by steam reforming (SMR) or 
from water by electrolysis. Today hydrogen-based steelmaking is a potential low 
carbon and economically attractive route in a few countries where natural gas is 
cheap.
A few number of studies have been done focusing on utilization of hydrogen in 
industrial furnace, H2 production from BFG (Blast Furnace Gas) and COG (Coke 
oven gas), nuclear hydrogen steelmaking system in different countries out of 
ULCOS. In 2013, Ranzani da Costa et al. proposed pure H2 based steelmaking pro-
cess by developing mathematical modeling where pure hydrogen (H2) used as 
reducing agent in the direct reduction (DR) process. It might be the core process of 
a new and cleaner way to produce steel with lower CO2 emissions. ULCOS studied 
a hydrogen-based steelmaking breakthrough route where H2 would be generated by 
water electrolysis using hydraulic or nuclear electricity. In a shaft furnace, by using 
H2 iron ore would be reduced to direct reduced iron (DRI) and carbon-free DRI 
would be processed in an electric arc furnace (EAF) to produce steel (Fig. 22.8). 
This route would be a promising breakthrough technology regarding CO2 emissions 
up to 300 kg CO2/ton steel, as well as the CO2 cost of electricity, and emissions from 
the DR furnace almost zero. It shows an 84 % cut in CO2 emissions compared to the 
current 1850 kg CO2/ton steel of the best blast furnace route (Chen et al. 2012).
This new route would be a more sustainable way for iron and steel production. 
Nevertheless, its future development and deployment is largely dependent on the 
emergence of a so-called H2 economy, when this gas would become available in 
large quantities, at competitive cost, and with low CO2 emissions for its production.

In addition, the uncertainties lay with the competition of other sectors for hydrogen 
consumption, for example, transportation sector would be ready to pay much higher 
prices for it than the steel industry.
22.4.2.6  Biomass-Based Steel Production (SP7)
Using biomass as a bioreducer in the blast furnace could be one of the processes to 
reduce the fossil CO2 emissions of steelmaking. Biomass constitutes mainly carbon 
(C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) and 50 wt% (dry matter, 
dm) shear of carbon in the wood. The carbon content in the wood biomass is low 
compared to fossil fuels, for example coal, coke, or oil used in iron and steelmaking. 
Besides, the sulfur content is also low approximately 0.01–0.1 wt% (dm) which is 
advantageous for blast furnace ironmaking. The key challenges in using biomass 
whether it might be considered sustainable are: (1) the cultivation of biomass does 
not damage the environment in terms of deforestation, air and water pollution, and 
reduction of biodiversity (2) the use of biomass will not be occurring undesirable

social and economic impact such as food price increment and removal of the ­original 
people from their land (Onarheim et al. 2015).
The most prospective solution for biomass production for the steel industry is 
charcoal by planting eucalyptus trees in tropical countries (e.g., Brazil or Angola). 
In Brazil eucalyptus plantation technology is mature and has advanced conversion 
process. A small size BF with 100 % charcoal is being run in Brazil (e.g., Acesita) 
and bringing a version of this technology to Europe is the challenge for 
ULCOS. However, it is difficult to sustain high hot strength of coke required in blast 
furnace when charcoal is added in the coal blend (Fig. 22.9).
22.4.2.7  ULCOS CCS Project (SP6)
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) presents one of the most promising options for 
large scale CO2 emission reduction for the future. Iron and steel plants are suitable 
for CCS because emissions generated from single fixed and easily accessible points. 
In order to capture CO2, it is needed to separate from flue gases from emission and then 
compressed and/or cooled and transported by pipelines network for underground 
storage.
ULCOS incorporated different CCS technologies in its ongoing experimental 
projects in Europe. A new CCS technology named VPSA (Vacuum Pressure Swing 
Adsorption) built by Air Liquide has been deployed in Lulea TGR-BF experimental 
project. For a larger scale experiment, a commercial blast furnace will be set up 
Fig. 22.9  The use of biomass as a reducing agent for ironmaking process

under ULCOS II. In this plant the flue gases will be stored in deep saline aquifer 
where higher level of purity in CO2 is required. By using cryogenics further purifi-
cation of the steam would be done in the BF. Here, the optimized system consists of 
a combination of a PSA and of a cryogenics. ULCOS TGR-BF experiments show 
that chemisorption technologies such as amine scrubbing, physisorption, the VPSA 
or PSA and cryogenics have different fields of optimality. The level of CO2 concen-
tration of the gas stream to be treated in the TGR-BF for physisorption systems are 
the best in terms of technical performance and economical operation. It has also 
been efficient if CCS is applied in ULCORED (Siitonen et al. 2010). For HIsarna 
only a cryogenics unit is enough because it directly delivers a very-high concentra-
tion of CO2. In contrast, if CCS is deployed in others stack of the steel mill, and then 
an amine scrubbing unit would be the best solution.
22.5  Conclusions
Although CCS is considered a promising solution for emission reduction, it contrib-
utes to reducing the overall efficiency of a steel plant due to the high energy con-
sumption for solvent regeneration during capture processes. Therefore, combination 
of CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) technologies with waste heat recovery from 
flue gas and molten steelmaking slag could be critical in the near-term to support 
longer-term objectives for deployment of CCS in steel industry from the year 2035 
onwards. The utilization of CO2 includes: CO2 to fuels, enhanced commodity pro-
duction, enhanced hydrocarbon production, CO2 mineralization and chemicals 
­production will produce a lot of profits, while CCS is an only waste mitigation 
technology. With CCU the CO2 is converted to value added products.
However, hydrogen and biomass-based steelmaking also offer very attractive 
perspectives, while raising lots of major challenges. They will also require much 
research and development before they can be proven and implemented commer-
cially. Finally, it is clear that CO2 breakthrough technology has not fairly reached 
the level of being technology for the deployment in steel industry as it is still a 
concept that needs to be fleshed out and authenticated at a credible scale. Therefore,  
the initial gap and barrier for making this technology available, is the requirement 
of an enduring research and development effort through larger scale laboratory, 
pilot and demonstrator.

 Manganese Emissions From Steelmaking

 Abstract   Manganese emission from pyrometallurgical furnaces is becoming an 
important issue with more and more stringent environmental restrictions on hazard-
ous air pollutant (HAP) metals across the globe. Manganese is going to become 
the next pollutant in focus from 2016 onward. Mn emission from steelmaking or 
ferromanganese furnaces mainly depend on factors such as input load, gas ﬂ ow rate, 
blowing practice, and ﬁ nally the operating conditions of the dust capture systems 
which control particulate matter emissions. In the present study, several mecha-
nisms of dust formation have been reviewed, and a manganese mass balance was 
performed to understand the distribution of Mn between liquid metal, slag, and dust 
for a few BOFs in operation. Operational parameters such as oxygen ﬂ ow rate, 
blowing time, hot metal (HM) Mn content, scrap Mn content, end blow Mn%, and 
conditions of the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) were considered and correlated to 
plant measurements of Mn emission. Issues related to emissions from EAFs, ferro-
manganese furnaces, and high-Mn steels have been discussed as well.

23.1  Introduction 
 Manganese emission to the environment is becoming a major concern for all envi-
ronmental regulatory bodies around the world, and stringent limits are being 
imposed. Manganese is among the trace elements least toxic to mammals; however, 
exposure to abnormally high concentrations, resulting from anthropogenic sources, 
has resulted in adverse human health effects related to neurotoxicity and may be 
possible reprotoxicity. Manganese poisoning is  characterized   by progressive dete-
rioration of the central nervous system, sometimes accompanied by unrelated pneu-
monitis. The majority of cases have been associated with the breathing of manganese 
dust or fumes from mining and metallurgical operations. An outbreak of a form of 
pneumonia in inhabitants of Sauda, Norway, was attributed to manganese emissions 
from a ferromanganese furnace. Absorption via the gastrointestinal tract and through 
the skin has also been reported. An outbreak of manganese poisoning in Japan was 
attributed to ingestion of manganese-contaminated well water. In the early stages of 
poisoning, removal of the victim from the polluted environment usually clears up 
manganese; however, in chronic cases, the effects on the central nervous system are 
not completely reversible. Exposure to high concentrations of Mn may lead to 
 Parkinson disease . 
 On the review of literature and environmental guidelines from different coun-
tries, it was found that the permit limits are very different in each country, and in 
most cases a local municipal permit limit applies which overrules the federal stan-
dards. Table  23.1   introduces  some permit limits of manganese in air around the 
world. The USA has the strictest limit on manganese emissions in air.
  The principal sources of ambient environmental pollution by manganese are 
emissions from metallurgical processing plants and reprocessing waste materials. 
Emissions to the atmosphere from industrial plants and processes will vary consid-
erably, depending upon the process involved and the degree of control exercised. 
Manganese has been found in measurable amounts in practically all samples of 
suspended particulate matter collected by the National Air Surveillance Networks 
( NASN) from the air of some 300 urban areas. The highest concentrations, as 
expected, are found in the vicinity of ferromanganese alloy plants or related activi-
ties. The  NASN urban average manganese concentration is less than 0.2 microgram 
per cubic meter (μg/m 3 ), but several cities have annual averages in the 0.5–3.3 μg/
m 3  range. Occasional 24-hour concentrations as high as 14.0 × 10 3 μg/m 3  have been 
measured. Annual averages as high as 8.3 μg/m 3 have occurred in small communi-
ties located near a large point source in the highly industrialized Kanawha River 
Valley of West Virginia. In Norway, concentrations of over 46 μg/m 3 have been 
reported in the vicinity of a ferromanganese plant. Approximately 80 % of manga-
nese in the suspended particulate matter from six large cities in the USA was associ-
ated with particles in the respirable size range—that is, 5 μm or less in diameter. The 
existence of manganese in the smaller particles favors a widespread distribution of 
this pollutant. Such distribution has been conﬁ rmed by the analysis of precipitation 
samples collected at many remote locations in the USA (Singh  2005 ; Vasu  2006 ).

 It has been estimated that over 80 % of the total national manganese emissions in 
1968 was from iron, steel, and ferroalloy production. Dust from the handling of raw 
materials in metallurgical processing and other production activities, such as the 
manufacture of chemicals, fertilizers, fungicides, and dry cell batteries, may result 
in local manganese pollution problems ( 1975 ). Table  23.2 shows  the Mn emission 
factors for various ferrous and ferroalloy processes.

23 Manganese Emissions From Steelmaking

392
 Emissions from  oxygen steelmaking furnaces are in the form of solid ﬁ lterable 
particulate matter and condensable gasses. One of the largest sources of ﬁ lterable 
particulate matter (PM) and  hazardous air pollutant (HAP) metals is the BOF elec-
trostatic precipitator ( ESP ) during the oxygen blowing period, and a feasible option 
for reducing these emissions is to upgrade the ESPs to improve emission control 
performance. Consequently, reducing the ﬁ lterable PM emissions from these 
sources would result in co-control of HAP metals. Feasible controls have been dem-
onstrated at several steel mills in North America, Europe, and Japan. These mills 
use hoods exhausted to bag houses to capture emissions that occur when the blast 
furnace is tapped and when the BOF is charged and tapped. An efﬁ ciently designed 
and operated fume control system can achieve a reduction of 95 % or more (from the 
uncontrolled case) in HAP metal emissions from these sources. Review of historical 
test data suggests that, if variability in operating parameters is minimized and if the 
ESPs perform consistently at their lowest measured emission rates, emissions could 
be reduced by 50 % or more from current operating levels. 
 Manganese has been listed as one of the top hazardous air pollutant ( HAP) metals 
by environmental regulatory boards in Europe and North America. In a recent report 
by RTI international (Vasu  2006 ), it is seen that in the Detroit area, manganese tops the 
list among all HAP metals at 13 t per year with much lesser quantities of nickel, chro-
mium, and lead. Table  23.3  shows the exact numbers. Because of the high tempera-
tures of steelmaking operations (1600 °C), the more volatile metals are removed and 
concentrated in the PM. The primary metal HAP is manganese, which was reported in 
an EPA survey as about 1 % of the BOF dust. Other analyses of BOF dust averaged 
1.1 % manganese, 0.74 % lead, 0.03 % chromium, and 0.01 % nickel. BOF slag con-
tains about 4.3 % manganese, 0.001 % each lead and nickel, and 0.1 % chromium.
23.2  Theoretical Considerations 
23.2.1  Mechanisms of Dust Formation During Steelmaking 
 There are several hypotheses for the mechanism of dust formation in  basic oxygen 
furnaces (BOFs).  They are direct hot metal vaporization, hot metal/slag ejection by 
CO bubble bursting, metal/slag ejection by mechanical action of the impinging

oxygen jet, and entrainment of solid particles during top charging. It is difﬁ cult to 
say which is the dominant mechanism, but studies indicate that the mechanism 
changes during the blow time. Vaporization typically occurs due to local hot spots 
that are generated by highly exothermic reactions during oxygen blowing in the 
BOF process. Various studies indicated that the local hot spot temperature could be 
in the range of 2100–3050 °C (Goetz  1980 ). When  fume particles are formed 
entirely by the condensation of vapors, then the highly volatile elements (e.g., Mn) 
get enriched in the fume. In the temperature range of 1400–2100 °C, the vapor pres-
sure of Mn is 100–1000 times higher than that of iron; hence, analyses of fumes 
produced solely due to vaporization show Mn/Fe ratios in the order of 30–150 times 
compared to the Mn/Fe ratio in the bath. The dust particles formed as a result of the 
vaporization mechanism can be identiﬁ ed by their octagonal (FeFe 2 O 4 ) or rhombo-
hedral (Fe 2 O 3 ) shape. 
 The other mechanism is dust formation by  hot metal/slag ejection by CO bubble 
bursting or mechanical action of the impinging jet. In either case, the dust particles 
are spherical in shape. Also, the Mn/Fe ratio in the fume is almost equal to the Mn/
Fe ratio in the bath as there is no vaporization involved. In reality, BOF dust is 
formed by a combination of both mechanisms and that can be tracked by plotting 
the Mn/Fe ratio in fume to the Mn/Fe ratio in bath with blowing time. Goetz ( 1980 ) 
in his studies indicated that large ratios imply a mechanism of direct vaporization, 
whereas a low ratio indicates metal/slag ejection as the mechanism of dust forma-
tion. Figure  23.1 shows a typical Mn/Fe ratio plot with blowing time.
 Evidently, metal/slag  ejection  by CO bubble bursting or mechanical action is the 
dominant mechanism of dust formation at the beginning of the blow. However, 
toward the end of the blow, vaporization becomes more dominant. This ﬁ nding of 
1980 was also reconﬁ rmed by Tsujino et al. ( 1989 ) in 1989, Nedar ( 1996 ) in 1996, 
and Gritzan and Neuschutz in  2001 . Nedar also concluded that 60–70 % of the dust

is formed by metal/slag ejection (bubble bursting) mechanism, whereas other mech-
anisms contribute to the rest 30 %. Gritzan and Neuschutz ( 2001 ) also advocated for 
metal/slag ejections to be the primary mechanism for dust generation in BOF 
operations. 
 Based on Mn/Fe ratios, Goetz ( 1980 ) summarized that the amount of BOF dust 
generated by  vaporization mechanism during the decarburization period is about 
1.8 % by weight, whereas the degree of vaporization during preignition and re-blow 
is about 10 %. So it can be concluded that direct vaporization during the re-blow and 
preignition periods is about ﬁ ve times larger than that during decarburization period 
of the blow. However, the major mechanism of fume formation remains that of 
metal/slag ejection and bubble bursting. 
 Another probable cause of dust generation is top charging of lime during the 
blowing period. However, it is seen that top charging increases the dust generation 
rate only momentarily, i.e., it only affects the instantaneous dust generation rate and 
not on the total amount of dust generated. The possible reason for momentary 
increase in dust generation rate during top charging is because the slag layer col-
lapses due to solid lumps falling upon the slag. On the other hand, the early period 
of lime charging takes place before the slag starts to foam, and it is during this 
period that the increase in dust generation is particularly strong. Also, the top 
charged material are usually rough surfaced solid lumps which act as nucleation 
sites for CO bubbles and enhances bubble bursting and dust generation momen-
tarily. Goetz, in his thesis, also discussed the effect of bath temperature and bath 
carbon  content on fuming rates in a BOF. For a ﬁ xed carbon content, the lower the 
bath temperature (lower the superheat), the greater the metal/slag ejection and hence 
higher the fume rate. Lower bath temperatures also result in lower slag temperature 
and higher slag viscosities, which impedes the formation of a stable foamy slag 
cover and helps in entrapping a part of the metal ejections. This also results in 
higher fume rates. It can also be inferred that all parameters which contribute to 
stable foaming in the slag can reduce the dust emission rates from the furnace. 
Based on the extensive research effort conducted by Fruehan and his team ( 1995 ), 
a higher viscosity and lower density and surface tension of the slag lead to forma-
tion of foams with more height, which are also more stable and last longer, hence 
reducing the emission rates from the furnace. 
 The dust generation rate in the BOF decreases rapidly with blowing time. Goetz 
showed some typical curves (Fig.  23.2 ) to  represent  dust generation rate versus 
blowing time in an experimental BOF.
 The general trend of a decreasing dust generation rate with blow time was con-
ﬁ rmed in all cases of normal practice, and this phenomenon has been repeatedly 
reported in literature (Gritzan and Neuschutz  2001 ) (Figs.  23.3 and  23.4 ).
 Figure  23.5 shows the dust generation rate as a function of top-blown oxygen 
ﬂ ow rate during the middle stages of the blowing (one fourth to three fourth blow-
ing period) in a 250 and 300 t BOF with combined blowing practices (Tsujino et al. 
 1989 ). Higher ﬂ ow rates of oxygen results in increased dust generation rate.
 There is a direct relation between the dust generation rate  and carbon content of 
the melt and this has been reported by several investigators (Knaggs and Slater 
D. Li et al.

395
 1959 ; Turkdogan and Leake  1959 ; Ellis and Glover  1971 ; Ohno et al.  1986 ; Herwig 
 1995 ). In fact, the only variable that changes with blow time is the carbon content 
of the bath. Gritzan and Neuschutz ( 2001 ) based on their observations explained the 
steady decrease of dust generation rate with blowing time in a BOF. At the begin-
ning of the blow, due to high momentum and velocity of the oxygen jet impinging 
on the melt surface, large quantity of splashes are formed and ejected into the gas 
atmosphere above the melt. The droplets are greater than 10 mm, i.e., much larger

than dust particles. Most of the splashes/droplets return back to the melt after a para-
bolic ﬂ ight. As long as they contain sufﬁ cient carbon, their liquidus temperature is 
relatively low, and so they remain liquid during the entire ﬂ ight time. In that state, 
the droplets rapidly dissolve oxygen, which reacts with carbon to form CO bubbles 
inside the droplets/splashes. The CO  bubbles rise to the splash surface, burst, and

form smaller ﬁ lm and jet droplets, which are immediately carried away by the off- 
gas. Now the liquidus/solidus temperatures of these splashes will rise steadily with 
blow time as the carbon content of the melt decreases. With lower carbon content 
the formation of a solid shell around the splash starts earlier in its ﬂ ight above the 
bath. Then, the rapid dissolution of oxygen into the liquid splashes is restricted to a 
shorter period of time. This reduces the overall dust generation rate. With increasing 
blowing time, a stable layer of slag forms on the top surface of the melt, which also 
entraps most of the droplets formed by CO bubble bursting. Therefore, the overall, 
dust generation rate decreases with blow time. 
23.2.2  Size Distribution and Chemistry 
 Since this chapter’s focus is on manganese, the dust chemistry was reviewed in 
terms of Mn, MnO, and Mn/Fe ratio content in BOF dust. Some observations were 
also reported on dust particle size range and its relationship to dust chemistry. Goetz 
( 1980 ) reported on dust chemistry from industrial BOFs. The fume particles that 
result from vaporization are either hexagonal or octagonal in shape and exist over a 
limited size range of 0.05–0.2 μm in diameter. Fumes resulting from vaporization 
also have a very high concentration of volatile elements like Mn (50–150 times) 
than the bulk bath from which it originated. On the other hand, the dust particles 
which are formed by the process of metal spray/ejection are spherical in shape and 
exist over a larger size range from 0.05 to 5 μm in diameter. In these  dust/fumes , the 
concentration of Mn is the same as that in the bulk. Krichevtsov ( 1970 ) reported on 
the evolution of fume chemistry with blowing time. From Krichevtsov’s calcula-
tions, the average Mn/Fe ratio in the fume is around 0.033. In a BOF, the majority 
of the manganese is oxidized in the ﬁ rst few minutes of the blow, and then the Mn 
level in the bath ranges between 0.15 and 0.3 depending on the initial hot metal Mn 
content. Assuming the Fe content of the bath greater than 95 %, the Mn/Fe ratio in 
the bath is 10–15 times lower than that in the fume. From Krichevtsov’s results, the 
calculated Mn content of the fume ranges between 0.9 and 3.3 %. These calculations 
were used and the evolution of Mn content in the dust with blow time is plotted in 
Fig.  23.6 . It is clearly seen that the Mn content in the dust is not constant and varies 
along the blow period. The major chemical components of  BOF dust are (FeO x ), 
CaO, MgO, and MnO.
 Nedar ( 1996 ) reported on dust chemistry based on his tests on a 100 t BOF oper-
ation at SSAB Tunnplat AB, in Luleå, Sweden. He showed that Mn levels vary 
signiﬁ cantly in the two stages of the blow. The ﬁ rst part of the blow was for 7 min, 
while the second part lasted for another 6–10 min. 
 From a previous study by Laciak ( 1977 ) based on an operation at ArcelorMittal 
Dofasco, the Mn% in the fume versus blow time was also plotted and is shown 
Fig.  23.7 . Average Mn/Fe ratio in the fume is 0.46/61.7 = 0.007, whereas for the 
second part of the blow, it is 1.16/66.9 = 0.017 which is almost 2.5 times higher. So 
the dust is enriched with manganese in the second stage of the blow.

 Gritzan and Neuschutz ( 2001 ) reported on dust size and chemistry from their 
studies on a 200 t BOF operating at ThyssenKrupp, Dortmund. The Mn content of 
the dust varies between 0.077 and 0.38 wt%. A typical size distribution of the dust 
particles is shown in Fig.  23.8 . The observed  size distribution breaks down to four 
distinct classes with their individual maxima at 1, 12, 50, and 140 μm. The particle 
size distribution did not vary signiﬁ cantly with blowing time or with top charging.

 Tsujino et al. ( 1989 ) reported on dust composition and size range from their stud-
ies in 175, 250, and 300 t BOFs with minimum slag practice. Figures  23.9 and  23.10 
show the Mn/Fe ratio in the dust versus particle size for the early stages of blow and 
the end of the blow, respectively. When the dust particle size is as ﬁ ne as 5 μm or 
less, the smaller the dust particle size, the higher is the Mn/Fe ratio. The Mn/Fe ratio 
in dust whose particle size is 1 μm or less is about 5–20 times as much as that in the

melt. Also, with respect to dust having particle size of 5–10 μm, the Mn/Fe ratio in 
dust is lower than that in the bath, which is minimum for all particle sizes. When the 
particle size becomes larger, the Mn/Fe ratio in dust is approximately equal to that 
of the bath. At any dust generation rate, the smaller the dust particle size, the higher 
the concentration of Mn in the dust.
23.2.3  Factors Affecting End Blow Mn Content 
 The major operational parameters that inﬂ uence the end blow manganese behavior 
in the BOF are hot metal manganese input, slag volume, oxidation level, and tem-
perature (Dias Barao et al.  2008 ).  Manganese oxidation in the BOF occurs by either 
direct oxygen or by indirect oxidation via FeO. The  manganese oxidation reaction 
is exothermic implying lower equilibrium constant values with increasing tempera-
tures. So from a thermodynamic point of view, higher temperatures would lead to 
larger amounts of Mn recovery. However, manganese recovery is also affected by 
dissolved oxygen content. At the end of the blow, dissolved oxygen content is 
higher, and this leads to manganese oxidation. Manganese oxidation is mainly dic-
tated by lower temperatures, increasing FeO content and increasing the activity 
coefﬁ cients ratio of FeO and MnO. For a given slag composition and a known blow

temperature proﬁ le, the theoretical manganese partition can be calculated at every 
instant during the blow. Figure  23.11 shows the variation of Mn partition with blow-
ing time. It shows a good degree of ﬁ tting starting from the second period of blow-
ing (approximately at 40 %, when the oxygen lance height is increased, and the 
oxygen ﬂ ow rate is reduced), meaning that from this moment on, the manganese 
oxidation is controlled by slag/metal reaction and FeO oxidation. Figure  23.12 
shows the relationship between hot metal Mn content and end blow Mn concentra-
tion from data collected from ten steel plants in Brazil. There is deﬁ nitely an increase

in end blow manganese concentration if hot metal Mn content is high. It is evident 
that only a small fraction (17 %)  of   the hot metal manganese is recovered in the 
steel. The inﬂ uence of hot metal Mn content on end blow Mn is higher at higher 
carbon contents. The slag/metal manganese partition ratio decreases for increasing 
hot metal manganese content. The higher the temperature, the smaller the slag/
metal manganese partition ratio; this effect adds up to the effect of hot metal man-
ganese content. The effect of hot metal Si on end blow Mn is not disturbed by the 
oxidation level, and it is lesser than the effect of hot metal Mn content. Several fac-
tors that inﬂ uence the Mn partition between slag and metal are FeO and CaF 2 con-
tents of the slag, and temperature (Jung et al.  2002 ). The Mn distribution ratio 
increases with FeO content linearly in the FeO concentration range of (6–25 
mass %). The Mn partition  ratio decreases with increasing CaF 2 content in the slag. 
However, most plants do not use CaF 2 due to the environmental issues.
 Detailed data analysis was performed at a BOF shop in North America with two 
BOFs in operation, and similar trends on end blow Mn were observed. The results 
are presented in Fig.  23.13 (Chattopadhyay et al.).
23.3  Results and Discussion 
23.3.1  Mn Emissions From BOFs 
 One of the major reasons for increased focus on Mn is the quality of the raw materi-
als including iron ore pellets and scrap. The BOFs are usually receiving higher Mn 
hot metal than before, and this is obviously related to high-Mn hot metal production

two North American BOFs

at the blast furnaces. As the iron ore mines are digging deeper and deeper into the 
earth’s crust, the Mn content of the ore keeps on increasing. Figure  23.14 shows the 
trend for an iron ore mine in North America.
 Plants operate with varying levels of hot metal Mn (AIST  2012 ), and this is illus-
trated in Fig.  23.15 . HM  Mn  concentration can range between 0.2 and 1.0 wt% and 
depending on the Mn input load, the amount of Mn in the dust and fumes will be 
affected based on the partition ratio. Some data from steel plants were considered 
for the Mn mass balance analysis and the details are shown  in Table  23.4 . The mass 
balance was performed based on plant data, including steel and slag analysis and 
ESP dust  analysis and stack test data. It is clear from Table  23.5  that for BOFs, 
25–28 % of the Mn goes into the liquid steel, 69–71 % into the slag as MnO, and

3–4 % goes into the dust. Of course these partition ratios vary depending on the 
furnace operating conditions including temperature and partial pressure of oxygen. 
Considering the highly oxidizing nature in BOF furnaces, it is expected to have 
more Mn in the slag.
 About 3–4 % of Mn goes into the dust for BOFs, most of the dust should be cap-
tured by the ESP system. A good ESP that is well maintained can easily prevent Mn 
emissions by capturing most of the solid dust particles. Data was collected from a 
steel plant and PM and Mn emission rates (kg/h) were correlated with ESP operat-
ing condition. A summary of which is presented  in  Table  23.6 .
 Table  23.7 shows the ratio between the Mn% in the dust to the hot metal Mn%, 
and the ratio is fairly constant for various hot metal Mn levels. It ranges between 1.5 
and 1.9.

23.3.2  Manganese Emission From  High Mn Steels 
and Other Pyrometallurgical Processes 
 Most steel grades contain only about 0.5–1.0 % manganese, which as discussed 
above by itself is a safety and environmental concern. Obviously, production of 
Mn-rich ferroalloys (i.e., ferromanganese or silicomanganese) or specialty high-Mn 
alloys (e.g., twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) or transformation induced plastic-
ity (TRIP) steels) can emit more Mn to the atmosphere (if not controlled). 
 Recently, Paymandar et al. ( 2014 ) have investigated the interfacial reactions 
between slag and high manganese and aluminum alloy steels between 1500 and 
1550 °C. They experimentally measured the manganese loss due to evaporation 
from four different steel compositions: V1, 17%Mn-1.5%Al; V2, 22%Mn-1.5%Al; 
V3, 22%Mn-3%Al; and V4, 17%Mn-3%Al. They have concluded that the total 
manganese loss from these steels can be between 0.59 and 1.8 % of  the total manga-
nese content (Fig.  23.16 ), which is signiﬁ cant and necessarily needs to be 
controlled.
 Emission of Mn from high-Mn  ferroalloys is also a signiﬁ cant concern. High- 
carbon ferromanganese, which is primarily produced in submerged-arc electric fur-
naces, contains up to 80 wt-% Mn and 7.5 % carbon. The recovery of Mn in the 
alloy is about 70–80 %; the remainder reports to slag as MnO or to the off-gas as 
Mn-containing species. The slag generated during FeMn production may contain as 
high as 42 wt-% Mn and is used to produce silicomanganese, containing 12.5–
18.5 wt-% silicon and ~65–68 wt-% Mn, which will in turn be used for to alloy 
low-carbon steel. 
  Hatch and the International Manganese Institute (IMnI)   have recently completed 
the ﬁ rst  life cycle assessment (LCA)  of global manganese alloy production. The 
study considered 17 manganese mines and smelters providing a standard measure of 
average environmental performance for the release of greenhouse gasses, particulate

406
matter (PM), NO X and SO X , as well as water and energy consumption and waste 
generation (Westfall et al.  2015 ). In this analysis, the LCA supply chain has been 
grouped into the following categories, which also represent sources of Mn 
emission:
 1.  Mineral extraction and hauling. 
 2.  Ore processing, beneﬁ ciation, and delivery. 
 3.  Sinter production and delivery. 
 4.  Smelting (furnace production), in all three types of electric arc furnace, i.e., 
open, semi-open, and sealed. This unit process is the major source of Mn emis-
sion. To address this issue, the following controlling equipment have been used:
•  Fabric ﬁ lters with particulate capturing efﬁ ciency of over 99 % 
•  High-pressure-drop venturi scrubbers with particulate capturing efﬁ ciencies 
between 94 and 98 % 
•  Wet scrubbers, including both multistage centrifugal scrubbers and venture 
scrubbers, with particulate removal efﬁ ciency of 99 % 
 5.   Metal casting, crushing and screening, materials handling, and other auxiliary 
smelter activities. 
 The United States  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ( 1985 ) has derived 
emission factors for  ferromanganese production furnaces  , assuming an average Mn 
ore grade of 45 % and production of 80 wt-% Mn FeMn,  listed in Table  23.8 .
 Most of the alloying in steel is done at the LRF, and thus it is important to see the 
partition ratio of Mn in the LRF. Data was collected from two LRFs in operation at 
a steel plant in North America. These particular LRFs had a very low oxygen level 
as Al was added in majority of the heats. Because of low oxygen potential, very 
little Mn was lost in the slag as MnO. Table  23.9 shows the distribution of Mn in the 
LRF. It is clearly seen that 99 % of the Mn is retained in the liquid steel, 0.78 % goes 
into the slag and 0.001 % goes into the dust. The stirring energy and oxygen poten-
tial is very little at the LRF when compared to the BOF. As the major mechanism of 
Mn emissions is by CO bubble bursting and mechanical action, these results are 
very reasonable.

23.3.3  Manganese Consumption 
 The  manganese consumption in the steel industry is not projected to increase substan-
tially in the next 10 years, estimated consumption per ton of crude steel will remain at 
~7 kg/t. Some new steel grades with higher Mn are being developed; however, it is not 
anticipated that these products will have a signiﬁ cant impact on the overall Mn con-
sumption rate. There are some other TRIP and TWIP steel grades with Mn levels in 
excess of 20 % which are being developed for small niche products; however, special 
continuous casters are required to cast such product, and this will not have a signiﬁ -
cant impact on overall Mn consumption. Overall crude steel production is projected to 
increase in the next 10 years; the expected annual growth rates in steel are ~3.0 % 
which will ultimately translate into an overall increase in manganese consumption. To 
put this into perspective, the projected annual increase in crude steel production is 45 
million ton per year, which will impact Mn consumption. Increased BOF steel produc-
tion will increase the consumption of higher Mn-containing  iron  ores, which can 
potentially increase the Mn emission levels from the BOF if environmental systems 
are not maintained properly. However, the majority of the increased Mn associated 
with this increase in steel production will be in ferroalloys added typically when the 
steelmaking furnaces are tapping or subsequently at secondary ladle metallurgy facili-
ties (ladle furnaces and vacuum degassers). Emissions associated with these manga-
nese additions should be captured by the secondary emission systems at the steelmaking 
furnace or with fume capture equipment at the secondary treatment facilities.  
23.4  Conclusions 
 Mn emission is a concern because of its detrimental effects related to neurotoxicity 
and perhaps reprotoxicity. The steel industry is one of the major sources of Mn 
emissions, and in today’s scenario, the raw materials have more Mn content in them

than before. The higher Mn content in the ore is attributed to the increased amount 
of Mn in the earth’s crust, as it is being mined deeper and deeper. The higher Mn in 
the ore results in higher Mn in the hot metal which in turn causes the problem of Mn 
emissions during basic oxygen steelmaking. The dominant mechanism of Mn emis-
sion in the BOF is by mechanical action due to the supersonic jet, as well as CO 
bubble bursting, due to high oxygen potential. The results show that as the hot metal 
Mn is increased, the Mn in the slag and dust have also increased proportionally. For 
a BOF, typically 25–30 % Mn is retained in the steel, and 65–70 % goes into the 
slag, and around 3–4 % goes into the dust. However, it is not a concern as long as 
the off-gas cleaning systems are well maintained. This study showed that, for an 
upgraded and well maintained ESP, the stringent permit limits can be achieved. 
 Emission of Mn from high-Mn ferroalloys is also a signiﬁ cant concern: High- 
carbon ferromanganese, which is primarily produced in submerged-arc electric fur-
naces, contains up to 80 wt-% Mn and 7.5 % carbon. The recovery of Mn in the 
alloy is about 70–80 %; the remainder reports to slag as MnO or to the off-gas as 
Mn-containing species. 
 When alloying is performed at the LRF/LMF, the conditions are signiﬁ cantly 
different. The oxygen potential and the stirring energy at the LRF/LMF are way 
lower than the BOF, and hence retention of Mn alloy in the steel is almost 99 %, and 
very little ends up in the emissions. Therefore, for the production of high-Mn steels, 
majority of the alloying should be performed at the LRF/LMF, resulting in little Mn 
dust emission.

Potential of Best Available and Radically New 
Technologies for Cutting Carbon Dioxide 
Emissions in Ironmaking
Volodymyr Shatokha
Abstract  Transition to a low-carbon economy requires modernisation of the iron 
and steel industry. Improvement of energy efficiency of blast furnace ironmaking, 
development of new and rapid commercialisation of currently developed innovative 
ironmaking technologies and deployment of carbon capture and storage/utilisation 
technologies are required to reach sustainability targets. Four scenarios with various 
combinations of energy efficiency enhancement and different market penetration of 
breakthrough ironmaking technologies have been developed and analysed. 
Deployment of the best available technologies is indispensable though not suffi-
cient for cutting CO2 emissions to an extent required by the climate change mitiga-
tion targets established by the International Energy Agency. Increased share of 
secondary steel produced via EAF method using gradually decarbonised electricity 
also is a prerequisite for substantial cutting of CO2 emissions. Rapid and wide 
­commercialisation of currently developed innovative ironmaking technologies  
after 2020 allows for reaching emission levels consistent with the targets up to 
2030–2040, depending upon the market penetration. However, in the following 
years even in the most radical modernisation scenario, new impulse is needed to 
align CO2 emissions with sustainability targets. Hydrogen-based ironmaking, 
enhanced material efficiency, greater share of secondary steel production and CCS/
CCU technologies can play the role of such impulse. Delayed and limited mitiga-
tion actions will result in much greater amounts of CO2 emitted to atmosphere with 
unavoidable impact on climate.

24.1  Introduction
Reducing carbon dioxide emissions becomes increasingly important driver behind 
the technology advancement of the iron and steel industry under emerging paradigm 
of industrial transformation towards meeting the climate change mitigation targets 
(Rynikiewicz 2008).
Iron and steel industry is responsible for 6.7 % of all global anthropogenic CO2 
emissions (Worldsteel Assoc. 2015a). In the EU its share in total industrial CO2 
emissions is 21 % (Croezen and Korteland 2010). In the countries where iron and 
steel sector plays more dominant role in the economy, its share is more essential—
e.g., 30.6 % in Ukraine (Shatokha 2015). Therefore, cutting CO2 emissions in the 
iron and steel industry is indispensable for reaching the climate change mitigation 
targets. Ambitious 2DS1 of the International Energy Agency (IEA 2014) envisages 
reduction of CO2 emissions in the iron and steel industry (including cokemaking) by 
28 % in 2050 compared to 2011 is envisaged despite an expected increase in crude 
steel production by 51 % within the same period. This target is difficult to reach, and 
the fact that the 2DS contradicts both historical and current development trends in 
this industry has been noted (IEA 2014).
In Fig. 24.1 the statistic data on crude steel production and total CO2 emissions, 
calculated using CO2 intensity data (Worldsteel Assoc. 2015a) for the period from 
2003 (a year starting from which global data for CO2 emissions are being collected 
by Worldsteel) to 2014, are shown together with the IEA model for the period of 
2020–2050 based on low-demand and high-demand variants of 2DS (IEA 2014). 
Steel production growth decelerates in both IEA variants but—to some extent—

might be considered as a continuation of the current trend. However, the levels and 
the trend for predicted CO2 emissions fully contradict historic data: unlike in any 
previous period, the production growth and CO2 emissions have to be decoupled 
from each other. Obviously, such a transition can hardly be possible on the business 
as usual basis. Even implementation of the best available technologies might not be 
sufficient, and a disruptive innovation will be required.
The integrated steel production route where a blast furnace is used as the major 
technology to produce iron represents 71 % of world steel production, standing for 
82 % of energy consumption and 88 % of CO2 emissions (Laplace Conseil 2013). 
More specifically, the blast furnace itself consumes nearly a half of energy of the 
integrated steelmaking factory (Gutowski et al. 2013). Energy sources in the iron 
and steel industry are almost completely associated with consumption of fossil 
fuels; hence, substantial cutting of carbon dioxide emission requires delivery of the 
following targets:
–– Improvement of energy efficiency of the blast furnace ironmaking
–– Development of new and rapid commercialisation of currently developed radi-
cally innovative ironmaking technologies allowing to phase out an iron ore 
agglomeration and a cokemaking
–– Implementation of carbon capture and storage/utilisation technologies
Current paper explores potential of these options and their combinations for 
decoupling of carbon dioxide emissions from production growth and for reaching 
the climate change mitigation targets.
24.2  Methodology
Steelmaking routes considered in this study, their market shares and CO2 emission 
intensities are presented in Table 24.1. Data on market shares for 2013 are taken 
based on the Worldsteel statistics (Worldsteel Assoc. 2015c). In 2013 (final data for 
2014 are unavailable at a time of this study), 1.8 t CO2 was emitted to atmosphere 
per tonne of crude steel (Worldsteel Assoc. 2015b); however, emissions for specific 
steel production routes are not reported by Worldsteel. Literature data on CO2 emis-
sion intensity for specific steel production routes vary in very wide range. With the 
production levels of blast furnace pig iron, DRI products and crude steel in 2013

(via BOF, OHF, EAF and other methods) reported by Worldsteel, we found it pos-
sible to balance CO2 emission intensity for the steel production routes by using the 
figures represented in Table 24.1 in order to obtain the reported 1.8 t CO2 per tonne 
of crude steel. Share of scrap in the BOF steelmaking was taken as 15 %.
Figures for 2050 are based on the assumptions on the best available technolo-
gies’ deployment (discussed in Sect. 24.3.1 below).
In order to simplify the analysis, BOF and OHF are considered in a combination 
where the OHFs are gradually phased out being fully replaced by BOF. For the 
same reason, production of liquid iron in blast furnaces is combined with that in 
Corex apparatus. Production of all solid reduced iron products via different (current 
and future) routes is combined to DRI.
The figures for future CO2 emissions per tonne of crude steel required to reach 
2DS targets were taken from the paper of Krabbe et al. (2015) where corporate 
industrial targets are aligned with the IEA model (IEA 2014).
Penetration of the best available technologies (BAT) and the breakthrough tech-
nologies (BT) was calculated based on the S-curve model with following 
assumptions:
–– All technologies reach saturation levels by 2050.
–– The year of rapid penetration growth is taken as 2025 for the BAT and as 2030 
for the BT.
24.3  Technologies and Scenarios
24.3.1  Best Available Energy-Saving Technologies
Improvement of the efficiency and reducing of the carbon footprint for existing 
processes through modernisation of the equipment, energy system optimisation and 
energy recovery based on the proven solutions require less capital investment com-
pared to implementation of novel technologies and can be easily multiplied through 
the technology transfer (Lee 2013). In the IEA 2DS energy efficiency improvements 
play a major role, providing 42 % of the total predicted emission reduction in the 
iron and steel industry. Significant share of this amount is to be reached through 
blast furnace improvements, notably in India, China and Ukraine (IEA 2014).
Within the period from 1960 to 2014, the iron and steel industry has reduced its 
energy consumption per tonne of steel produced by 60 %; however, it is commonly 
recognised that there is little room for further improvement of energy efficiency on 
the basis of existing technology (Worldsteel Assoc. 2015a). From 2000 to 2011, 
energy intensity per one tonne of crude steel decreased by 4.6 % (from 20.7 to 
21.7 GJ/t crude steel), although probably more essential improvement was offset by 
a decline in recycling as a share of total crude steel production from 47 % in 2000 to 
29 % in 2011—mostly because China’s steel industry has been developed based on 
less scrap-intensive BF-BOF route rather than the EAF due to insufficient scrap

availability (IEA 2014). Gutowski et al. (2013) show that energy intensity to pro-
duce pig iron through blast furnace technology already approaches thermodynamic 
limit; however, as it can be seen from Fig. 24.2 (data by the IEA), the potential to 
cut energy consumption varies from country to country in very wide range: for 
Japan, South Korea, Europe (OECD) and the USA, energy-saving potential is lim-
ited within 1–2 GJ per tonne of crude steel, whereas for Ukraine it exceeds 7 GJ per 
tonne of crude steel. This variety relates to several factors, among which the most 
important are structure of the industry, conditions of the equipment, BAT penetra-
tion and quality of raw materials. As it is seen from Fig. 24.2, blast furnace improve-
ments still have to play a major role in reducing world’s average energy consumption 
in the iron and steel industry.
The best available technologies, considered for modernisation of ironmaking in 
two representative studies by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA 2012) 
and a Reference Report by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European 
Commission (Pardo et al. 2012), are summarised in Table 24.2. It should be noted 
that some of these technologies are truly energy saving, whereas some other repre-
sent fuel switch from more carbon-intensive coke to coal or hydrocarbons.
In this study we do not distinguish carbon dioxide emissions cutting potential for 
each technology but consider instead cumulative effect from the BAT deployment in 
all sub-sectors of the iron and steel industry including iron ore agglomeration, coke-
making, iron and steel making, casting and rolling. According to the IEA modelling 
(IEA 2010), CO2 emission reduction potential achieved through the BAT deploy-
ment accounts for 420 MtCO2 per year, representing 19 % of CO2 emissions in the 
sector in 2010. Milford et al. (2013) in their forecast use more conservative figure of 
14 % based on earlier estimation (IEA 2008). In our study we modelled the effect of 
BAT deployment for both variants—with 14 and 19 % reduction of CO2 emissions 
(Table 24.3).

24.3.2  The Breakthrough Technologies
The technologies under development with greater degree of radicalness are identi-
fied in our study as follows.
Top gas recycling blast furnace (TGR BF) is one of the key technologies initiated 
in ULCOS project of the EU. It implies an oxygen blast with the PCI injection, 
separation of the top gas into CO2 and CO + N2 with returning the latter after pre-
heating either into conditional tuyeres or to the lower shaft. TGR BF might be an 
option for both new enterprises and for brown field modernisation. Technological 
aspects were worked out at the experimental LKAB blast furnace in Luleå, Sweden. 
With recirculation ratio of 90 %, coke consumption was down by 25 % which cor-
responds to cutting 24 % of CO2 (ULCOS 2014).

Authors of comprehensive study (Croezen and Korteland 2010) state that “the 
TGR process does not give a net reduction in energy consumption as reduced coke 
consumption is balanced by an increased electric power requirement for CO2 sepa-
ration. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced if CO2 is sequestered”. However, 
modelling by Jin et al. (2015) demonstrates possibility to cut energy consumption 
by 12.2 % and to reduce net CO2 emissions by 35.7 %, even taking into account CO2 
emissions related to energy consumed to separate increased quantity of O2 from the 
air (to produce oxygen blast) and CO2 from the top gas. However, in cited paper all 
the top gas produced is either separated or burned to reheat the recycled CO, with 
zero amount of gas entering energy network of an enterprise, which is hardly eco-
nomically feasible: at an integrated steelwork, blast furnace top gas is indispensable 
component of energy mix. Reduction of CO2 emissions by 15 % per tonne of final 
product is considered in paper by van der Stel (2013), and this figure is taken in our 
analysis.
Pilot implementation of this technology was planned in 2015 at ArcelorMittal 
Florange (France); however, in 2013 the project has been suspended. Currently it is 
being continued in the frames of Low Impact Steelmaking project funded by 
ArcelorMittal and French government, though future timeline for its commerciali-
sation is unclear.
HIsarna is a reduction smelting technology that combines Cyclone Converter 
Furnace (CCF) and Smelt Reduction Vessel (SRV). Both CCF and SRV apparatuses 
have a long history of development. The CCF has been developed by then Hoogovens 
company in the 1990s with pilot plant processing 15–20 t of iron ore per hour. Iron 
ore and oxygen were injected into the cyclone where the burning of gas occurs (ini-
tially an artificial gas imitating the gas produced in the SRV was used). The prod-
uct—partially molten and reduced for 10–20 % ore with temperature of 1450 °C 
under force of gravity—flows down along the walls (in the pilot plan, it was dis-
charged to the slag ladle).
The SRV HIsmelt (high-intensity iron smelting) dates back to oxygen bottom 
blowing converter KOBM (Klockner Oxygen Blown Maxhutte) modified to pro-
duce iron. First HIsmelt pilot plant with 2 t of hot metal per hour was launched in 
Maxhutte in the 1980s. Next pilot plant with 8 t of hot metal per hour was erected 
in Kwinana (Australia), and a larger plant with design capacity of 0.80 Mt of hot 
metal per year was launched in 2005 and operated till the end of 2008 as the result 
of collaboration between Rio Tinto, Nucor Corporation, Mitsubishi Corporation 
and Shougang Corporation (Rio Tinto 2016). Later on HIsmelt has been relocated 
from Australia to China. Although commissioning of first Chinese HIsmelt plant 
with 0.5 Mt capacity was planned yet in 2014, we found no information concerning 
current status of this project. Moreover, according to the IEA data (IEA 2014), 
1.0–1.2  Mt HIsmelt-based steelwork was planned to be operational by 2016  in 
India, but no further information available for this project as well. However, obvi-
ously there exists a long-term experience in scaling up and industrial operation for 
HIsmelt.
In Europe HIsarna (hybrid of the CCF and HIsmelt) is being developed by Tata 
Steel in IJmuiden as part of the former ULCOS project in collaboration with Rio 
Tinto as well as with other steelmaking and engineering companies such as

ArcelorMittal, ThyssenKrupp Steel, voestalpine Stahl and Paul Wurth. A former hot 
metal desulphurisation plant has been revamped with erection of HIsarna pilot plant 
producing 8 t of pig iron per hour. During pilot campaigns in 2012–2014, a possibil-
ity of using various coal grades and an upper limit of productivity were studied. For 
2015 it was planned to study peculiarities of long-term operation in order to explore 
possible drawbacks of design and to prepare upscaling. Reaching of 7 t of pig iron 
per hour benchmark has been reported constituting 88 % of initially designed pro-
ductivity (Meijer et al. 2015). Demonstration is planned to finish by 2018 with fur-
ther upscaling and commercialisation after 2020.
Compared to blast furnace ironmaking, the following advantages of HIsarna are 
noted:
–– Production cost reduces owing to phasing out coking and sintering/pelletising 
and possibility to use lower-grade coals and other solid fuels.
–– Adaptability to wide range of raw materials including phosphorous ores, titano-
magnetites and quartzites.
–– Low inertia and possibility to adjust operation towards availability of materials 
and other factors without affecting the product quality.
Another reduction smelting technology, Romelt, is under commercialisation in 
Myanmar by Russian supplier with production capacity of 0.2 million tonnes per 
year and commissioning expected in 2016 (Tyazhpromexport 2016). However, very 
little information about current state of Romelt (technology is being developed 
since the 1980s) is available; therefore, HIsarna is taken to represent the category of 
reduction smelting technologies in this study.
HIsarna emits more CO2 than a blast furnace; however, thanks to phasing out 
cokemaking and sintering, the aggregate CO2 emissions per tonne of crude steel are 
estimated to be 20 % lower compared to conventional BF-BOF route (Croezen and 
Korteland 2010).
Finex is the ironmaking technology developed by POSCO in collaboration with 
Siemens VAI. The prototype of Finex is Corex technology developed by Siemens 
VAI and commercialised in 1989 in SAR and later in India. Corex has two parts: a 
shaft furnace for iron ore prereduction and a melter gasifier. Relatively low effi-
ciency of utilising reductive potential of the gas in Corex is followed by much 
higher CO content in a top gas compared to a blast furnace. Therefore, in terms of 
energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction, this technology can compete with 
traditional blast furnace only if (1) top gas is completely utilised for production of 
electricity in very efficient generators and (2) if CO2 emission factor at power gen-
eration of the grid is above 0.9 kg CO2/kWh (Hu et al. 2009), a case for countries 
where the electricity generation is mostly coal based.
In 1992 POSCO started the development of a novel Finex technology where—in 
lieu of a shaft furnace—a cascade of fluidised bed reactors is used to heat up and 
pre-reduce the ore and a briquetting machine is used to compact pre-reduced ore 
and coal. These novelties enabled the use of low-grade and fine raw materials. 
Constructed in 1996 laboratory installation with productivity of 15 t pig iron per day 
was upscaled in 1999 to a pilot plant with productivity of 150 t per day. In 2003 
V. Shatokha

demonstration plant with Finex apparatus producing 0.6 Mt of pig iron per year has 
been erected, followed by launching in 2007 of the first commercial plant with pro-
duction capacity of 1.5 Mt in 2007 at Pohang works. Experience attained allowed to 
simplify the design and to launch in January 2014 Finex plant with productivity of 
2 Mt per year (Lee 2009).
The best result achieved so far is 700 kg of solid fuel per tonne of pig iron that 
corresponds to 97 % of average fuel consumption in blast furnace technology. With 
the help of better process control, it is expected to reach in the nearest future the 
benchmark of 680 kg per tonne with further decrease to 660 kg per tonne that will 
correspond to 93 and 90 % CO2 emissions compared to blast furnace. Longer-term 
plans envisage application of the CCS with extraction of 0.7 т CO2 per tonne of pig 
iron that will cut CO2 emissions by 53 % compared to blast furnace. Finex is oxygen-­
based technology; hence, the CCS efficiency must be better than for the blast fur-
nace top gas (Yi and Lee 2015). In our paper we consider carbon dioxide cutting 
potential of Finex as 10 %.
Other innovative technologies such as Ironmaking by Hydrogen Flash Smelting 
and Molten Oxide Electrolysis being developed under the aegis of the American 
Iron and Steel Institute, as well as ULCOWIN and ULCOLYSIS initiated in the 
EU-funded ULCOS project (Wins 2012; Sohn 2008). Hydrogen-based ironmaking 
is also part of the Japan’s COURSE 50 project (Tonomura 2013). However, these 
technologies are currently still on early R&D stage with commercialisation planned 
beyond 2030 or even 2050. Although these technologies are not included to our 
model, a need to develop them is revealed in the discussion below.
24.3.3  Scenarios
In this study we explore the pathways towards reaching the sustainability targets, 
established by the International Energy Agency (IEA 2014).
The IEA considers two options—with low and high demand for steel. The direct 
CO2 emission reduction target is the same in both options, so greater emission 
reductions are needed in the high-demand case. In 2 °C scenario (2DS), global pop-
ulation and economic growth are decoupled from energy demand. It optimistically 
assumes technology development, considering that low-carbon technologies will be 
cost-effective and that barriers associated with regulatory frameworks and social 
acceptance will be overcome (IEA 2014).
In the 2DS, by 2050 the largely decarbonised electricity mix depends on fossil 
fuels just for 20 %—down from 70 % in 2011. Based on this assumption, we con-
sider decreasing of CO2 emissions in the non-integrated EAF-based steelmaking 
route also by 50 % in 2050 (see Table 24.1). The overall share of the EAF in total 
crude steel production increases to 37 % by 2025 in 2DS (IEA 2014). In our model 
the EAF share follows the S-curve, reaching this target as envisaged by the IEA in 
2025 and arriving to 40 % in 2050.
24  Potential of Best Available and Radically New Technologies for Cutting Carbon…

We studied four scenarios (Table 24.3) where iron and steelmaking technologies 
are represented as follows:
–– BAT only scenario involves adoption of the BAT; however, it doesn’t envisage 
deployment of any breakthrough technologies. Steel production structure doesn’t 
change: the share of secondary steel production through the EAF method is lim-
ited at current 25.8 % level (2014). Finex attains limited commercialisation gain-
ing 1 % of the primary iron production market.
–– BAT + scrap scenario in addition to BAT only implies greater availability of scrap 
resulting at 40 % of steel production through EAF (36.9 % in scrap EAF and 
3.1 % in DRI-EAF; see also Table 24.1) in 2050.
–– BAT + scrap + InnoM scenario in addition to BAT + scrap envisages moderate 
level of BT deployment. In this scenario 65 % of liquid iron still produced in 
conventional blast furnaces, 5 % in blast furnaces modified for top gas recycling, 
20 % in HIsarna and 10 % in Finex.
–– BAT + scrap + InnoR is the most radical scenario where all remaining blast fur-
naces are modified to produce just 5 % of total liquid iron with top gas recycling, 
85 % of liquid iron is produced in HIsarna and 10 % in Finex.
Two variants are modelled—with 14 and 19 % CO2 cutting achieved via BAT 
deployment.
24.4  Results and Discussion
Results of modelling of the scenarios described above are shown in Fig. 24.3. It is 
obvious that the results achieved via BAT only scenario are very far from the IEA 
targets. However, increased share of steel production via the EAF (in case if elec-
tricity generation is decarbonised to a planned level) in BAT + scrap scenario drasti-
cally changes the situation, making CO2 emissions very close to the IEA target in 
2030–2033 even in case if BATs’ carbon-cutting efficiency is to 14 %. However, 
further CO2 emission reduction becomes limited arriving at 1.28 t of CO2 per tonne 
of crude steel in 2050. This behaviour is connected to the features of the model: 
both decarbonisation of the EAF production and share of secondary steel produc-
tion follow the S-curve.
Moderate deployment of breakthrough technologies in BAT + scrap + InnoM sce-
nario only slightly improves the result compared to BAT + scrap: deviation from the 
IEA target is delayed for about 5 years, and the emission intensity decreases to 
1.22 t of CO2 per tonne of crude steel in 2050.
Most radical modernisation with global deployment of breakthrough technolo-
gies in BAT + scrap + InnoR scenario allows for reaching the results consistent with 
the IEA targets during 2033–2040. However, after that, owing to saturation of the 
market with BTs, emission intensity also deviates from the IEA target achieving the 
level of 1.07 t of CO2 per tonne of crude steel in 2050.
For the case where BATs will allow cutting CO2 emissions by 19 % (Fig. 24.3b), 
the results improve quantitatively both in terms of the emissions intensity achieved

and delayed deviation from the IEA pathway. Moreover, for the BAT + scrap + InnoR 
scenario, CO2 emissions’ cutting essentially exceeds the IEA targets within more 
than 10-year period. However, even for this scenario, neither BATs nor BTs can 
deliver result established by IEA by 2050 and beyond.
The results of modelling for all scenarios show that well before 2050 another 
radically new technology (in addition to those analysed in this study and with much

Several ironmaking technologies with very low- or zero-carbon intensity are 
being developed. In particular, in the mentioned above ULCOLYSIS and Molten 
Oxide Electrolysis processes, electric potential is used to separate iron and oxygen 
in molten electrolyte producing liquid iron and oxygen gas by the following sum-

However, this technology still on its fundamental development phase needed to 
overcome such challenges as stability of anode material (graphite is not acceptable 
owing to unavoidable CO2 emission carbon, whereas iridium, considered as most 
promising, is scarce and expensive) and reoxidation of reduced liquid iron. 
Moreover, this technology is sensible only if the electricity source is fully decar-
bonised (Wang et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2010).
Several hydrogen-based ironmaking technologies are under development world-
wide. In particular flash ironmaking process is being developed by the University of 
Utah in collaboration with several industrial companies (Sohn 2008). This process 
is analogue to flash smelting technology, well proven in copper industry and also 
adapted for production of nickel and lead (Outotec 2016). It has a potential to reduce 
energy consumption compared to blast furnace ironmaking by 38 %. In case if 
hydrogen is used as reductant, CO2 emissions will be decreased by 96 %, for natural 
gas this figure goes down to 61 % and for coal to 31 % (Sohn 2008; Chen et al. 
2015). Currently this technology is on the phase of fundamental laboratory experi-
ments and modelling. High cost of hydrogen is mentioned by the developers as the 
major barrier for commercialisation of this technology (Sohn and Choi 2009).
Generally, the use of hydrogen for metal smelting is considered by the 
Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) as a longer-term option for 
mitigating the industrial CO2 emissions, capable to enter the marketplace only 
beyond 2030 (IPCC 2007). Various technologies aimed to produce affordable 
hydrogen with zero- or very low-carbon intensity are being developed nowadays; 
however, other barriers such as transportation and storage of hydrogen in large 
quantities shall also be noted (Fekete et al. 2015; Le Duigou et al. 2013).
Other approaches for decreasing carbon footprint from steel industry can also be 
considered—such as substantially enhanced material efficiency (resulting in the 
demand for steel decreased below the IEA low-demand model) and more essential 
share of secondary steel production. Material efficiency scenarios and greater scrap 
availability scenarios are studied comprehensively in the works by Pauliuk et al. 
(2013) and Allwood et al. (2010, 2011). Even though both options can be consid-
ered as plausible, several challenges are noted such as insufficient quality of second-
ary steel and lack of control over the capacities to be built in the developing countries 
despite the availability of unutilised capacities in the developed world (so-called 
capacity follow demand scenario).

The share of CO2 emissions to be treated through carbon cutting and sequestra-
tion or utilisation technologies is shown in Fig. 24.4. Obtained results are generally 
consistent with IEA scenario envisaging capturing 40 % of the sector’s direct CO2 
emissions by 2050 (IEA 2014). In any scenario, to avoid excess of the emissions 
over IEA targets, CCS/CCU technologies shall be deployed in case if no technology 
with the carbon intensity lower than that of the technologies included in current 
analysis is developed and implemented. It should be noted that CCS/CCU technolo-
gies still are on early development phase and deployment of CCS may face also 
social acceptance factor owing to unpredictable effect on the environment.

24.5  Conclusions
The following conclusions are drawn from the results of this study:
	1.	 Transition to a low-carbon economy in line with the objectives established by the 
IEA requires rapid and radical modernisation of iron and steel industry.
	2.	 Deployment of the best available technologies is indispensable though not suf-
ficient for cutting CO2 emissions to the extent required by climate change mitiga-
tion targets.
	3.	 Increased share of secondary steel produced via the EAF method using gradually 
decarbonised electricity is a prerequisite for substantial cutting the CO2 emissions. 
However, problems of scrap availability and quality of secondary steel product 
shall be addressed.
	4.	 Rapid and wide commercialisation of currently developed innovative technolo-
gies after 2020 allows for reaching emission level consistent with the IEA targets 
up to 2030–2040, depending upon market penetration. However, even in the 
most radical modernisation scenario, new impulse is needed to align the emis-
sions with sustainable targets. Hydrogen-based ironmaking, enhanced material 
efficiency, greater share of secondary steel production and CCS/CCU technolo-
gies can play the role of such an impulse.
	5.	 Delayed and limited mitigation actions will result in much greater amounts of 
CO2 emitted to the atmosphere with unavoidable impact on climate.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Energy 
Consumption of Ironmaking Processes
Hong Yong Sohn and Yousef Mohassab
Abstract  The emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), mainly carbon dioxide, and 
energy consumption levels of a number of ironmaking processes including several 
new technologies that are currently under development worldwide are analyzed and 
compared. In terms of total emissions of greenhouse gas, energy consumption is 
important because the production of fuels and energy indirectly adds to the total 
amount of emissions. The relevant levels of emissions and energy requirements are 
compared with those of an average blast furnace, which is currently the dominant 
ironmaking process. The article will also discuss the needs for alternate ironmaking 
processes and present the descriptions of major alternate ironmaking processes, 
including important novel technologies under development. Finally, different meth-
ods for calculating process energy vs total energy requirement in ironmaking will be 
discussed.
25.1  Introduction
Iron is produced worldwide via blast furnace (BF), direct reduction (DR), and 
recently smelting reduction (SR). The BF is the dominant means for making iron, 
after which comes DR. Currently, smelting reduction shares a relatively small por-
tion of global iron production; however, increasing attention is being paid to this 
process as a competitor to the BF process. The BF technology is well established 
and dominates the commercial ironmaking industry. Some DR and SR processes, 
however, have already been adopted in ironmaking plants. In addition to these three 
technologies, there are electrolysis-based technologies to produce iron, which are 
currently under research; we will refer to it as EI in this text. These ironmaking 
processes will be discussed in some details in the following sections.

A novel process, Flash Ironmaking Technology (FIT), is under development at 
the University of Utah and will be discussed in some detail and compared with the 
current processes as well as with some of those that are under research.
25.2  Blast Furnace and Needs for Alternate Ironmaking 
Processes
The blast furnace process has been the major method of iron production for over 
600 years (Strassburger et al. 1969), and currently produces approximately 94 % of 
the primary iron, also known as pig iron (WSA 2012). The smallest blast furnaces 
have a capacity of 0.550 Mt pig iron per year; however, the state-of-the-art ones 
produce 2–4 Mt pig iron per year.
The blast furnace ironmaking is a countercurrent process occurring in a shaft 
furnace. Iron-bearing raw materials such as sinter, pellets, or lump ore of mostly 
magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), and goethite (Fe2O3.H2O) (Yellishetty et al. 
2010), coke, and flux (limestone) are fed into a shaft furnace from the top, and pre-
heated air (blast) is blown into the bottom through tuyeres to burn and provide the 
heat required for the smelting process. Coke is made by pyrolyzing the coal (i.e., 
heating in the absence of oxygen at high temperatures). In the BF, coke functions as: 
(1) the main chemical reductant of iron ore to iron, (2) fuel, and (3) strong and per-
meable support for the burden, allowing an adequate flow of gases through the fur-
nace. Coke retains its strength at high temperatures in contrast to coal that tends to 
soften at elevated temperatures. Fine ores cannot be directly charged to the blast 
furnace; rather, they have to be sintered or pelletized. The purpose of sintering and 
pelletizing is to render the fine charge into strong but porous clinker and agglomer-
ated balls (pellets) with a size of ~1.5 cm to enhance the burden permeability and 
facilitate the reduction (Worrell et al. 2010). Supplementary fuels, such as pulver-
ized coal, natural gas (NG), and oil, are also injected into the furnace through the 
tuyeres to reduce the consumption of coke, which is expensive. The hot air reacts 
with coke and injected fuels, forming 2273–2773 K (2000–2500 °C) hot gas. This 
hot gas rises and passes through the raw materials that descend from the top. While 
the hot gases (mostly N2, CO, and CO2) ascend, their sensible heat is transferred to 
the descending materials and as a result the gas temperature decreases, while the 
descending charge is heated and experiences a series of physicochemical changes, 
most importantly the partial reduction of iron oxides. The final reduction to iron, the 
desulfurization, and silica reduction occur in the lower part of the bosh and the cru-
cible where the temperature is high. The reduction takes place by CO and H2 in the 
gas and solid carbon in coke. Liquid hot metal (pig iron) and molten slag are formed 
in the hearth of the furnace. The blast furnace is a chemically and thermally efficient 
reactor. Moreover, there have been efforts to improve the BF process in terms of 
increasing productivity and energy efficiency, decreasing coke consumption, devel-
oping better cokemaking processes, reducing CO2 emissions, increasing pulverized

coal injection, and injecting natural gas and plastics. Many of these steps to improve 
the BF process have already been commercialized. Furthermore, R&D efforts to 
improve the BF process are continuing. Examples are the reformation of coke oven 
gas with the aid of catalysts (Course 50), top gas recycling, CO2 capture and stor-
age, avoiding gas flaring, and heat recovery from slag (IETD 2012a).
Despite aforementioned merits and improvements, the blast furnace process still 
suffers from drawbacks. As long as the blast furnace is used, the needs for sintering/
pelletizing of the ore and high-grade coking coal cannot be avoided. Other materials 
preparation contributes significantly to the energy consumption as well as CO2 
emissions in the blast furnace process. Figure 25.1 indicates that ore and coke prep-
aration emits ~20 % of the total CO2 in the BF–BOF route and the BF contributes 
~70 %, whereas the steelmaking step adds only ~11 % of the total emissions (Orth 
et al. 2007) from a typical integrated steel plant. Moreover, the BF process is energy 
intensive and requires a high capital cost as it entails large infrastructure. Table 25.1 
compares the primary energy intensity, defined as the energy used for the produc-
tion facility as well as to generate the electricity consumed at the facility, to produce 
a metric ton of mild steel for three steelmaking technologies (Worrell et al. 2008). It 
is seen that the BF consumes around 78 % of the total energy required in the BF–
BOF route (Worrell et al. 2008).
Since the Kyoto protocol (38 nations agreed in 1997 to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions on average by 5.2 % by 2012) was announced, greenhouse gases (GHG) 
emissions and the resulting climate change have continued to be a significant envi-
ronmental issue for the steel industry and, in particular, the BF process, as will be 
discussed later.

25.3  Major Alternate Ironmaking Processes
25.3.1  Direct Reduction
Direct reduction processes are mostly gas-based, which are globally dominated by 
Midrex technology (63 % of world DR) (IPTS 2009). Ore (fines, pellets, or lumps) 
is reduced in solid state—unlike BF process where a liquid metal is produced. 
Direct reduced iron (DRI) or sponge iron offers an alternative steel production route 
to BF–BOF and Scrap–EAF routes. DRI production is common in the Middle East, 
South America, India, and Mexico. DR offers an attractive route due to its low capi-
tal investment and its suitability to local raw material situations (IETD 2012a, b). 
Despite the aforementioned advantages, the DR route suffers from drawbacks such 
as the small scale of operations, which acts as a barrier for energy efficiency invest-
ments. Also, DRI is prone to re-oxidation unless passivated or briquetted. The 
energy requirement of the DR–EAF route is compared with the BF–BOF route in 
Table 25.1, which shows that the former route requires ~2 GJ per metric ton of steel 
more than the latter.
The quality of DRI is highly dependent on the feed quality, unlike hot metal 
produced by the BF with stable and dependable quality (IPTS 2009). In DR, natural 
gas and coal are the two primary fuels. More than 90 % of the global DRI plants use 
natural gas, whereas production in India is mainly coal based.
DRI processes can be grouped according to the type of reactor used, namely 
(IETD 2012a, b):
•	 Shaft furnaces (Midrex, Energiron)
•	 Rotary kilns (SL/RN process)
•	 Rotary hearth furnaces (Fastmet/Fastmelt, and ITmk3)
•	 Fluidized bed reactors (Circored)

In DR, iron oxide is reduced below the melting point of iron, involving no molten 
slag phase. Therefore, all gangue elements of the iron ore remain in the DRI and 
need to be separated via the slag in the EAF. This increases the electrical energy and 
electrode consumption of the EAF compared to steel scrap melting (secondary 
steelmaking). This energy consumption can be reduced by immediate transfer of hot 
DRI to the EAF melt shop. By doing this, the heat from the direct reduction process 
lowers the cost of melting the DRI in the EAF, considerably cutting the energy costs 
and electrode consumption (IETD 2012b).
The most widely used technologies for DRI production are Midrex and Energiron, 
both using natural gas. The energy consumption in natural gas-based DRI produc-
tion is well known and established to be 10–11.4 GJ/t-DRI. Natural gas-based DRI 
production also leads to lower CO2 emissions, with emissions ranging from 0.77 to 
0.92 t of CO2 per ton of steel (compared with ~1.9 t of CO2 per ton of steel for the 
BF–BOF route), depending on the type of electricity used (IETD 2012a, b). At pres-
ent, this process is more expensive than the BF process and it also demands better 
quality iron ore, which increases the cost and limits its flexibility. The amount of 
electricity required for melting DRI in EAF also makes the process less efficient in 
terms of energy use (18 GJ/t of crude steel compared with 16 GJ/t in the BF–BOF 
route, as shown in Table 25.1). The clear potential of this proven technology, how-
ever, is the removal of the need for coke ovens and reducing CO2 emissions.
Table 25.2 summarizes reported information on the levels of energy consump-
tion and CO2 emissions associated with various direct reduction technologies 
together with the development status.
25.3.2  Smelting Reduction
Smelting reduction (SR) processes are the latest development in pig iron produc-
tion. The SR emerged during the 1990s. In SR, iron ore and coal are added directly 
to a metal-slag bath where the ore is reduced. The SR combines the gasification of 
coal with the melt reduction of iron ore. Energy consumption of smelting reduction 
is lower than that of blast furnace, as coking step is avoided and the need for ore 
preparation is reduced. Examples of this process are Finex and HIsmelt. Although 
SR reduces GHG emissions, the process demands higher energy for ironmaking 
step (18.7 GJ/t of crude steel) that exceeds the total energy required for the entire 
steelmaking process through the BF–BOF route (15.8 GJ/t) (Worrell et al. 2008).
In 2003, Birat et al. (2004) made a benchmarking study that was based on pro-
cess calculations. This study was aimed to visualize the future scenarios of steel-
making technologies beyond Kyoto protocol. Based on their study, the results of 
which are presented in Fig. 25.2, the share of different ironmaking technologies 
which could be in place in 2050 was forecasted with a total steel make in excess of 
2300 Mt (compared with 1518 Mt in 2011) (Gupta and Sahajwalla 2005; WSA 
2012). The BF is expected still to be the largest process for iron production; how-
ever, it is expected to drop from 94 % in 2011 to 60 % in 2050. Based on the same

Despite the dominance of the blast furnace ironmaking process, increasing attention 
is paid to the development of a new technology with lower energy consumption and 
CO2 emissions. It should also require much less capital investment than the blast 
furnace/coke oven combination. At the University of Utah, an alternative technol-
ogy to meet these demands, called the FIT, has been under development (Sohn 
2007; Pinegar et al. 2011, 2012a, b; Mohassab Ahmed 2013; Chen et al. 2015a).

This novel technology eliminates the highly problematic cokemaking and pelletiza-
tion/sintering steps by directly utilizing iron ore concentrate, which is in abundance 
in the USA and elsewhere. In this article, recent advances on this work are 
discussed.
The FIT is an innovative process that uses iron ore concentrate directly without 
further treatment. The fineness of the concentrate particles allows a very rapid reac-
tion rate, thus requiring residence times measured in seconds instead of the minutes 
and hours it takes to reduce pellets and even iron ore fines.
H.Y. Sohn and Y. Mohassab

435
Other processes for the gaseous reduction of iron oxide can be grouped into two 
broad types: (1) shaft furnaces [Midrex (Cheeley 1999) and Energiron (Duarte et al. 
2008)] and (2) fluidized bed reactors [FINMET and the earlier FIOR (Hassan et al. 
1994), CIRCORED process (Husain et al. 1999), and SPIREX (Macauley 1997)]. 
Shaft furnaces require pellets or sinter, which are 10–12 mm in size and require 
minutes or even hours to be fully reduced. The fluid bed processes use “iron ore 
fines,” particles in the range of +0.1 mm to −10 mm. These processes are slow 
because the larger pellets and particles react slowly and the process cannot be oper-
ated at high temperatures, under which they suffer the problems of sticking and 
fusion of particles. Processes that can replace the blast furnace must be sufficiently 
intensive to meet the large production rates required for economic competitiveness. 
The FIT reduces iron ore concentrates of <100 μm sizes, which are even smaller 
than fines by one or two orders of magnitude. Historically, fluidized bed processes 
using iron ore fines have been less than successful. Compared with concentrate 
particles, even ore “fines” used in a fluidized bed take much longer time to reduce 
than the time available in a typical flash reduction process.
The FIT removes many of the limitations associated with the other processes 
discussed above. Specifically, (1) it uses iron oxide concentrates directly without the 
need for pelletization or sintering; (2) coke ovens are not required; (3) high tempera-
tures can be used because there will be little particle sticking or fusion problems 
(and thus, the process can be operated at high temperatures); (4) it is possible to 
produce either solid or molten iron; and (5) the raw materials can be fed continu-
ously. The process also has the possibility of direct steelmaking in a single unit, as 
depicted in Fig. 25.3.
In this paper we will describe major progresses made so far on the Flash 
Ironmaking research, especially the kinetics of the reduction process, the chemistry 
of the slag, and the economic and environmental aspects of the process.
25.4.1.2  Reduction Kinetics
As an integral part of the development of this novel process, Sohn and coworkers 
(Chen et al. 2015a, b; Choi and Sohn 2010) have determined the kinetics of the 
gaseous reduction of magnetite concentrate particles aimed at generating a database 
to be used for the design of a flash ironmaking reactor—before their work, there had 
been little research reported on this subject under the conditions of the FIT. Their 
work included the measurement of the particle kinetics of the reduction of magne-
tite or hematite concentrate particles by hydrogen or carbon monoxide in the tem-
perature range of 1423–1673 K (1150–1400 °C) (Chen et al. 2015a, b; Choi and 
Sohn 2010; Wang and Sohn 2013). Most importantly, they established that magne-
tite concentrate can be reduced to a degree higher than 90 pct within several sec-
onds, which presents sufficiently rapid kinetics for a flash reduction process. They 
obtained the following rate expression for the hydrogen reduction of magnetite con-
centrate particle in the temperature range 1423 K (1150 °C) to 1623 K (1350 °C) 
which is given by

Although the FIT is being developed for magnetite concentrate, it is expected to 
be equally applicable to hematite concentrate. Thus, Sohn and coworkers (Chen 
et al. 2015a) studied the hydrogen reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate parti-
cles of average size 21.3 μm in the temperature range 1423–1623 K (1150–1400 °C). 
The results clearly indicated that the hematite concentrate can also be reduced to 
greater than 90 pct degree by hydrogen in the several seconds of residence time 
typically available in a flash reactor. In their work (Chen et al. 2015a), results at 
various temperatures and partial pressures of hydrogen showed that the nucleation 
and growth rate equation with an Avrami parameter of 1 well describes the kinetics 
of hematite reduction. The reduction rate has a first-order dependence on the partial

pressure of hydrogen. The activation energy of hydrogen reduction of hematite con-
centrate is 214 kJ/mol (Chen et al. 2015a). The following rate equation was obtained, 
which satisfactorily represents the reduction kinetics of hematite particles:

where R is 8.314 J/mol K, T is in K, p is in atm, and t is in seconds.
Compared with the activation energy of the hydrogen reduction of magnetite 
concentrate of 196 kJ/mol in the temperature range 1423–1673 K (1150–1400 °C), 
the reduction of hematite concentrate has a lower activation energy of 214 kJ/mol in 
the similar temperature range.
Hematite reduction kinetics by CO + H2 mixtures was also investigated to repre-
sent the case of using natural gas or coal gas as the reductant/fuel in the flash iron-
making process (Mohassab et al. 2016). The kinetics in this case is complicated due 
to the simultaneous reduction by the two reductants. It was, however, found that 
within a few seconds of residence time, a reduction degree of over 90 pct was 
achieved using either CO + H2 at temperatures above 1573 K (1300 °C), as shown in 
Fig. 25.4. It is also clear that adding CO to the H2 boosts the reduction kinetics as 
compared with the reduction by a single gas H2 or CO.  Increasing CO partial

­pressure from 0.05 to 0.2 atm while holding hydrogen partial pressure at 0.2 atm did 
not affect the reduction kinetics of hematite concentrate, as Fig. 25.4 shows.
The measurement of the kinetics of the flash reduction continues to determine 
the rate equation for the reduction of magnetite and hematite concentrate with mix-
tures of CO and H2 gases to be used in designing flash reactor that will run on natu-
ral gas.
On the other hand, Sohn and coworkers (Yuan and Sohn 2014; Yuan et al. 2013) 
studied the kinetics of the re-oxidation of iron particles produced by the FIT in vari-
ous oxidizing gas mixtures. As the gas–particle mixture cools down in the lower 
part of the flash reactor, the re-oxidation of iron could take place because of the 
decreasing equilibrium constant and the high reactivity of the freshly reduced fine 
iron particles. The last stage of hydrogen reduction of iron oxide, i.e., the reduction 
of wustite, is significantly limited by equilibrium. The effects of temperature [823–
973 K (550–700 °C)] and H2O partial pressure (40–100 pct.) on the re-oxidation 
rate were examined. The nucleation and growth model was shown to best describe 
the re-oxidation kinetics. Pressure dependence was first order with respect to water 
vapor, and the activation energy was 146 kJ/mol. A complete rate equation that 
adequately represents the experimental data was developed (Yuan et al. 2013). They 
also studied the oxidation in pure CO2 gas in the temperature range of 873–1073 K 
(600–800 °C). Their findings indicated that within the several seconds of residence 
time typically available in a flash reduction process the re-oxidation degree of iron 
particles in water vapor should be <0.24 % in the temperature range of 823–973 K 
(550–700 °C) and the results implied that the oxidation will be negligible in the 
flash reduction process where CO2 from partial combustion of natural gas with oxy-
gen accounts for less than 10 % in the gas mixture. In the collector where product 
iron particles may be kept for up to one hour at around 673 K (400 °C), the expected 
re-oxidation degree would be around 0.02 % (Yuan 2013; Yuan and Sohn 2014; 
Yuan et al. 2013). This indicates that re-oxidation within the reactor due to the shift-
ing of equilibrium as temperature decreases toward the bottom of the reactor is of 
no concern.
The pyrophoricity of DRI when it comes into contact with air is of concern dur-
ing storage or transportation. Thus, oxidation of flash reduced iron in O2–N2 gas 
mixtures was investigated to determine the effects of temperature [673–873 K (400–
600 °C)] and O2 partial pressure (5–21 pct.). The rate data were analyzed based on 
the nucleation and growth model, which resulted a pressure dependence of first 
order with respect to oxygen and an activation energy of 14.4 kJ/mol (Yuan and 
Sohn 2014). Most importantly, it was concluded that flash reduced iron is much less 
vulnerable to oxidation than conventional DRI particles. This is because the flash 
ironmaking process uses higher reduction temperatures, leading to a lower specific 
surface area of the product iron. This can be clearly seen from the micrographs 
presented in Fig. 25.5 which shows iron oxide reduced at a lower temperature at 
which conventional DRI is produced (Fig. 25.5a) compared with iron produced at a 
flash ironmaking temperature (Fig. 25.5b). This work determined that at tempera-
tures lower than 573 K (300 °C), the oxidation of flash reduced iron is not of great 
concern (Yuan and Sohn 2014).

25.4.1.3  Slag Chemistry
In addition, the slag chemistry was studied under the conditions of the FIT. Sohn 
and coworkers (Mohassab-Ahmed and Sohn 2014a, b; Mohassab-Ahmed et  al. 
2012a, b; Mohassab-Ahmed et al. 2014; Mohassab and Sohn 2014a, b, 2015) have 
applied a number of analytical techniques to determine the structures and properties 
of the slags formed under the conditions of flash ironmaking. These techniques

have been proved to be highly useful for this purpose. Several features of such 
instrumental analysis have direct correlations with important properties of slag 
such as its affinity to impurities. These techniques were applied to slags of interest 
for the FIT, especially in terms of the effects of water vapor expected to be present 
in high contents in the new process (Mohassab Ahmed 2013). Water vapor was 
found to be advantageous for lowering FeO in slag (Mohassab and Sohn 2014a), 
and manganese (Mohassab-Ahmed and Sohn 2014b). Moreover they found that 
water vapor in the atmosphere of the new process would keep lining wear low 
based on the low MgO solubility in slag under its expected operating conditions 
(Mohassab and Sohn 2014a). The research on slag also found that water vapor 
decreased sulfur (Mohassab and Sohn 2014b) and phosphorus (Mohassab and Sohn 
2015) in produced molten iron.
25.4.1.4  Economic and Environmental Aspects
The economic and environmental aspects of the FIT were also studied. Process sim-
ulation for the FIT was carried out by Sohn and coworkers using the METSIM soft-
ware to assess the economic feasibility for different process configurations (Pinegar 
et al. 2012a, b, c). Major results are summarized in Figs. 25.6 and 25.7. Figure 25.6 
shows potential energy saving, lower carbon footprint, and economic feasibility 
(except when purchased H2 is used) relative to the BF. However, application of a $50 
per ton of CO2 credit should make the use of hydrogen economically feasible at the 
2010 price of hydrogen, as Fig. 25.6 indicates (Pinegar et al. 2012a, b, c).
In summary, this transformative technology has significant energy saving and 
reduced CO2 emissions compared with the blast furnace process. It has been proved 
that iron particles of more than 95 % metallization can be obtained by reduction 
with hydrogen or a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen in 2–7 s at tempera-
tures of 1573 K (1300 °C) or above. The product of FIT, which is expected to oper-
ate at temperatures higher than 1273  K (1000  °C), is significantly less reactive 
towards oxygen compared with DRI produced by the current technologies. Also, the 
molten iron to be produced by the FIT will contain less impurities and the relevant 
slag would be less corrosive to furnace lining.
25.4.2  Electrolytic Ironmaking
In principle, iron oxide can be reduced by aqueous or molten electrolysis. There are 
two processes that are currently under research: (1) molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) 
and (2) aqueous electrolysis.
ULCOLYSIS (ULCOS 2012) and the Sadoway process (Kim et al. 2011) are the 
two molten electrolysis processes under research to reduce iron from iron oxide in 
a molten bath. In MOE processes, iron ore is dissolved in a molten oxide mixture at 
1823–1973 K (1550–1700 °C). The anode, made of a material inert towards the 
H.Y. Sohn and Y. Mohassab

441
oxide mixture, is dipped in this solution. Electrical current is passed between this 
anode and a liquid iron pool connected to the circuit as the cathode. Oxygen evolves 
as a gas at the anode and iron is produced as a liquid metal at the cathode.
ULCOWIN (ULCOS 2012) is an example of a research project to study the 
aqueous electrolysis, often referred to as electrowinning, as a means to produce iron 
on a large scale. Unlike MOE, aqueous electrolysis uses an alkaline solution (mostly 
aqueous NaOH) as the electrolyte. In addition, two inert electrodes are used. On the 
cathode, the iron cations are reduced and iron is plated.
Electrolysis still involves CO2 generation as the process relies intensively on 
electrical energy which is largely produced by the consumption of carbon-based 
fuels. Also, there are other obstacles to be overcome in MOE, such as the high tem-
perature required to maintain the electrolyte liquid as well as the electrode material 
for large scale. For aqueous electrolysis, in addition to the requirement of electrical 
energy, the major challenge is the large-scale solution treatment and purification as 
well as other problems associated with hydrometallurgical processes.

25.5  Methods for Calculating Energy Requirements: Need 
for Standardization
25.5.1  Introduction
Energy consumption is inseparably coupled with CO2 emissions under the current 
conditions in which most energy production relies on the combustion of fossil fuels. 
There are currently different ways to calculate and present energy requirements for 
ironmaking. Although the differences in energy requirements among different pro-
cesses are largely unaffected by the methods of calculation, as will be shown subse-
quently, the absolute values are affected by them. Thus, it deserves considerable 
attention to clearly understand what these different methods involve. It is also 
important to distinguish different types of energy in terms of relating them to associ-
ated carbon footprint.
When a process involves both endothermic chemical reactions and heat genera-
tion from the combustion of fuels, the choice of endothermic reactions to include in 
computing the “energy requirement” for the overall process is rather arbitrary and 
can be a source of confusion. It is shown that the essential question becomes whether

the heat of combustion of a reactant, which can be used as a fuel, should be included 
in the energy requirement value. It is noted that the choice is a matter of convention, 
but it is important to clearly state what convention is followed in presenting the 
results of energy calculations. There is a need to select a standard approach because 
the presented value of “energy requirement” of a process depends on this choice 
(Sohn and Olivas-Martinez 2014).
Different approaches are used for performing energy balance calculations and 
perhaps more significantly in presenting the “energy requirement” of a process. The 
question becomes more involved for a process in which one or more reactants are 
also used to generate the process heat by combustion. Often the key issue is which 
heat of chemical reaction to include in computing (or presenting) the “energy 
requirement” of the process.
We will use the example of ironmaking processes to illustrate the problem. In 
these processes, as currently practiced or under development, carbon and/or hydro-
carbons (including hydrogen) are used as the fuel as well as the reactant for reduc-
ing the iron oxide mineral (Sohn and Olivas-Martinez 2014). The different 
approaches for calculating the energy requirement in this case essentially boil down 
to the following question: Does one include the combustion heat of the reductant 
used in the reduction reaction or treat the reductant portion as just a reactant? 
Depending on the viewpoint, either approach can be considered acceptable. There 
is a need, however, to select a standard approach because the absolute value of 
“energy requirement” of an ironmaking process depends on such a choice. It is par-
ticularly important to clearly state the specific approach used when the energy 
requirement of ironmaking is compared with those of other industrial processes 
such as petrochemicals production.

where ni and nj denote the amounts of the ith reactant and the jth product, respec-
tively, and (HT − HTr) is the sensible enthalpy of a given species at the system tem-
perature (T). The first term on the left-hand side (LHS) of Eq. (25.4) represents the 
total enthalpy of the reactions occurring in the system at the reference temperature 
(Tr). When the overall chemical reaction is exothermic, this term is positive (i.e., 
energy input to the system). The opposite is true for overall endothermic reactions. 
In ironmaking process, this term is positive since energy is added to the system by 
the combustion of fuels.
The second term in the LHS of Eq. (25.4) is the energy added to the system in 
the form of sensible heat of the reactants [if the reactants enter the system at the 
reference temperature, this term is zero]. The first term on the right-hand side (RHS) 
represents the energy removed from the system in the form of sensible heat in the 
products. The second term on the RHS is the energy removed from the system in the 
form of heat losses to the surroundings. The last term in the RHS is the recoverable 
heat from the process (e.g., recovery of sensible heat of the off-gases). When some 
of the products contain a fuel value, it should be included in this term.
For a process involving chemical reactions to produce useful products and com-
bustion of fuels to generate process heat, the total reaction enthalpy is a sum of the 
two general terms shown in the following equation:

To calculate and compare energy requirements of different processes producing the

drawn so that all input materials enter the system at the reference temperature (i.e., 
298 K). Thus, the second term on the LHS of Eq. (25.6) is zero. The “total energy 
requirement” is then given by the following equation, taking into consideration that 
Qrecovered is credited to decrease energy requirement either by preheating some of the 
input stream or simply recovered as a useful energy source. The energy requirement

This equation assumes that the sensible heat contained in the products is unrecover-

to include in computing the “total energy requirement” [Eq. (25.7)] for the overall 
process is rather arbitrary and can be a source of confusion. In the following sec-
tions, the choice of the endothermic reactions on the resulting energy requirement is 
discussed and two approaches for calculating the energy requirement are described.
25.5.2.2  Definitions of Chemical Energy Terms
To reduce iron oxides to iron, the energy requirement for the reduction reaction can 
be defined in two ways: One is to consider the reduction as decomposing iron oxide 
to iron and oxygen (reverse of the energy of formation of iron oxide); the other is to 
consider it as a reaction of iron oxide with a reductant. [As shown below, the former 
is equivalent to including the heat of combustion of the fuel/reductant acting as a 
reductant in the total energy requirement, whereas the latter is equivalent to not 
including it.] The following is a simplified demonstration of these equivalences.
The demonstration is made just for the energy involved with chemical changes at 
a reference temperature (usually 298 K), excluding sensible heat and other energy 
terms [see Eq. (25.7)] which do not affect the argument discussed here.
Basis of the Simplified Demonstration
	1.	 The solid charge is composed of pure iron oxide. No flux materials are 
considered.
	2.	 Carbon is used as the fuel/reductant. However, this methodology can easily be 
extended to the case in which hydrogen or a hydrocarbon is used as the ­fuel/
reductant.
	3.	 The total carbon input is divided into two groups: fuel carbon and reductant 
carbon.
	4.	 The heat balance is performed over the entire system. The process outputs are 
iron and the complete combustion product (CO2) of fuel carbon plus the reduc-
tion product (CO2), all at 298 K.

where (C)r is the carbon consumed by the reduction reaction, (C)f is the carbon 
burned to generate heat, (O2)f is the oxygen for reaction with the fuel carbon, (CO2)r 
is the carbon dioxide produced by the reduction reaction, (CO2)f is the carbon diox-
ide produced by combustion of the fuel carbon, and x is the number of moles of the 
fuel portion of carbon required to generate the heat for the reduction process.
The enthalpy change of the overall reaction (25.8) is a combination of the energy 
required to reduce iron oxide and the energy produced by combustion of the fuel/
reductant. As mentioned in the Introduction, different definitions of “energy require-
ment” are possible depending on what one considers as the reduction reaction

Approach 1: Energy Requirement for Reduction Reaction Based on Oxide 
Decomposition
When the reduction of iron oxide is considered to be the decomposition of the iron 
oxide [Eq. (25.9)], the energy requirement for reduction process is the difference 
between the heats of reactions (25.8) and (25.9), which is equivalent to the heat of 
the following combustion reaction:

making industry follow this approach.

When the reduction of iron oxide is considered as the reaction of iron oxide with

tions (Pinegar et al. 2011, 2012a, b) have used this approach.
25.5.3  Results
The application of the above two approaches to the calculation of energy require-
ment is illustrated using as an example a novel flash ironmaking process under 
development at the University of Utah, described in Sect. 4.1, and an average blast 
furnace operation. For this purpose, a material and energy flow diagram prepared by 
Pinegar and coworkers (Pinegar et al. 2012a) for a commercial-scale reformerless 
flash ironmaking process producing one million tons of iron per year and operating 
with natural gas using the commercially available software METSIM is used.
25.5.3.1  Material and Energy Flows: System Boundary
Energy balance calculations start with material balance around a clearly defined 
system boundary. A system boundary can be drawn around different parts of a pro-
cess, depending on the purpose of the calculation. An illustration is given in 
Fig. 25.8. The solid lines represent material flow with associated sensible and latent 
heats, and the open arrows indicate the flow of heat only. Once the boundary is 
defined, any open-ended streams that cross it are the input and output streams. Any 
streams entirely inside a boundary (e.g., the off-gas in Fig. 25.8 in the case of the 
outer boundary) are not included in the balance calculations around that boundary.
It is noted that the heat contents of any output streams that can be recovered for 
a useful purpose, such as steam, should be credited to reduce the input amount of 
energy or “energy requirement.” This is equivalent to placing that term as a negative 
input item in the energy balance [Eq. (25.7)]. Heat losses and the sensible heat of an 
output stream that are not recovered are output items and increase the input amount 
and thus the “energy requirement.” Further, all heats of chemical reaction (chemical 
heat contents), including heat of combustion, are calculated at 298 K and all sensi-
ble heat in input or output streams is calculated relative to this temperature.
25.5.3.2  Energy Balances for Ironmaking Processes
Tables 25.4 and 25.5 present energy inputs and outputs, respectively, in terms of 
Approaches 1 and 2 for the flash ironmaking process using natural gas or hydrogen 
and for the average blast furnace operation. These values were calculated around the 
outer boundary in Fig. 25.8, depicted by the dashed line. The annual production 
rates in all the cases are one million tons of iron from a single unit of the ironmaking

reactor. The energy balance for the flash ironmaking process is based on the flow 
sheet presented by Pinegar et al. (2012a). Higher heating values (HHV) of natural 
gas and hydrogen were used to be conservative in calculating the energy require-
ments, respectively, of reformerless flash ironmaking and hydrogen-based flash 
ironmaking. The energy balance for an average blast furnace operation was calcu-
lated using published material balance data and applying the same method of calcu-
lating energy values as for the flash ironmaking process. Although not shown here, 
Sohn and Olivas-Martinez (2014) also presented the energy balances for the refor-
merless flash ironmaking process and for the average blast furnace as Sankey dia-
grams (Schlesinger 1995).
In the blast furnace process, the energy consumed by sintering, pelletizing, and 
cokemaking operations, which are not required in flash ironmaking, is part of the 
energy requirement and represents a significant portion of the overall energy 
requirement for the blast furnace operation. The ore/coke preparation accounts for 
30 and 40 % of the total energy input (which is defined as the sum of the input 
streams) in terms of Approaches 1 and 2, respectively (Sohn and Olivas-Martinez 
2014).
For the flash ironmaking process, the cases of using two different reductants/
fuels—natural gas or hydrogen—have been analyzed. The results of applying 
Approach 2 were adapted from Pinegar et al. (2011, 2012a) and those of applying 
Approach 1 were calculated by modifying the “Fuel combustion” term in the input 
category and the “Reduction” term in the output category, which are the only num-
bers that are different between Approaches 1 and 2.
In terms of the descriptions of Approaches 1 and 2 formulated above, the “fuel 
combustion” energy input was calculated by adding the energy (subtracting reaction

enthalpy) for iron ore reduction from the difference of heats of formation of all 
output components and input components [Eq. (25.8)]. This amount is equivalent to 
the heat of combustion of reaction (25.11) for Approach 1 and reaction (25.12) for 
Approach 2.
The “reduction” energy in the output category (i.e., Table 25.5) corresponds to 
the decomposition of magnetite (Fe3O4) [reaction (25.9) (6.68 GJ/t Fe)] for Approach 
1 for the flash ironmaking process. For the blast furnace, it corresponds to the heat 
of decomposition of hematite (Fe2O3) (7.37 GJ/t Fe). [Magnetite concentrate must 
be pelletized or sintered to be used in a blast furnace during which it is converted to 
hematite, generating heat. This heat generation is reflected in the energy require-
ment for pelletization. Thus, it is appropriate to use hematite as the feed material in 
blast furnace operations.] In Approach 2, the “reduction” energy corresponds to the 
heat of reduction reaction by hydrogen (0.91 GJ/t Fe) for flash ironmaking [even 
when natural gas is used, essentially all reduction is done by hydrogen produced

aEnergy balance was calculated by METSIM based on the published material balance
bFor flash ironmaking process, the reduction energy corresponds to the decomposition of magnetite (25.10) (6.68 GJ/t Fe) for Approach 1. For the blast furnace, 
it corresponds to the heat of decomposition of Fe2O3 (7.37 GJ/t Fe). In Approach 2, reduction energy corresponds to the heat of reduction reaction (25.11) 
(0.91 GJ/t Fe) for flash ironmaking and the heat of the reaction Fe2O3 + 3/2C = 2Fe + 3/2CO2 for the blast furnace [see discussion in the text for the justification 
of using hematite for the blast furnace]

from partial combustion of natural gas] and it is the heat of the reaction 
Fe2O3 + 3/2C = 2Fe + 3/2CO2 for the blast furnace.
The energy requirement calculated using Approach 2 is the “process energy 
requirement” and the difference between the total input energy by Approach 1 and 
the process energy requirement may be termed “reductant energy” [“feedstock 
energy” in petrochemicals production] (Sohn and Olivas-Martinez 2014).
25.5.4  Discussion
As can be seen in Tables 25.4 and 25.5, the difference in the energy requirements 
between each ironmaking process and the blast furnace remains largely the same 
regardless of the treatment given to the fuel used as a reductant.
The “energy requirements” of these processes can be obtained directly from the 
total amounts of energy inputs in Table 25.4 and outputs in Table 25.5. This is pos-
sible because in Table 25.4 the recovered heat is presented as a negative input item, 
as indicated by Eq. (25.7). The energy balance results can be presented with such an 
item listed as a positive output item in Table 25.5, in which case the “balance” is still 
achieved, as indicated by Eq. (25.6).
In some reports (De Beer et al. 2000; Sohn and Olivas-Martinez 2014), the 
energy required for decomposing iron oxide to iron and oxygen, reaction (25.9), is 
used as the “theoretically lowest” or “theoretical minimum” energy requirement. It 
is noted that this reaction, which does not actually take place under ironmaking 
processes, involves the largest enthalpy change (energy requirement) of any chemi-
cal reactions involved in the production of iron from iron oxide. This decomposition 
reaction requires more than 30 % of the energy input in both processes. The energy 
required for this reaction is used as an item of energy requirement in Approach 1 
above. In Approach 2, the endothermic heat of the reduction reaction [e.g., reaction 
(25.10)] is used for calculating energy requirement. This energy represents only 7 
and 15 % of the energy input when Approach 2 is used for determining the energy 
requirement for the flash ironmaking process and blast furnace, respectively.
A simple food-for-thought question: If we consider a process in which the 
reaction

occurs at room temperature, what do we consider as the energy requirement for the 
process? Is it the heat of reaction (25.13), or should it include the heat of combus-
tion of the carbon used as a reactant just because it has a heating value?
When calculating “energy requirements” and presenting the results, it is essential 
to clearly state the approach used. Specifically and most importantly, it should be 
stated whether or not the chemical heat content (the heat of combustion) of a reac-
tant that can also be used as a fuel is included in the calculated value of energy 
25  Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Energy Consumption of Ironmaking Processes

452
requirement. Even with these clarifications of approaches, it will make it much 
clearer to present distinct values for “process energy requirement” that includes 
only the heating value of the fuel and “reductant energy” (“feedstock energy” in 
petrochemicals production) that represents the chemical heating value of the mate-
rial used as a reactant.
It is advocated using just the “process energy requirement” as the standard value 
of the energy requirement for a process in which a reactant is also a fuel, which is 
equivalent to using Approach 2.
In addition, a statement regarding whether the higher heating value (HHV; 
assumes liquid water in the combustion products) or the lower heating value (LHV; 
assumes water vapor in the combustion products at 298 K) should be included 
when the fuel contains hydrogen. Another item of information often neglected that 
must be provided is the system boundary around which the material and energy 
balances are performed; that is, clear definitions of input and output streams and 
conditions.
25.6  Conclusions
According to the International Energy Association (IEA), the iron and steel sector 
accounts for 6.7 % of the world CO2 emissions. Also, the iron and steel industry is 
the second-largest industrial user of energy, consuming 2.58 × 107 TJ in 2007 and 
the largest industrial source of CO2 emissions (30 %). On average, 1.9 t of CO2 are 
emitted for every ton of steel produced coming mostly from the BF process as men-
tioned earlier.
Reduction in energy use and CO2 emissions in the steel industry is rapidly 
reaching the limits defined by the laws of physics and chemistry. In order to make 
major reductions in future energy consumption and CO2 emissions, new methods 
of making steel will require completely fresh and innovative thinking. Breakthrough 
technologies based on radically new routes will be required in order to fulfill the 
environmental regulations and energy consumption reduction plans.
Given the limited efficiency potential inherent in existing best technologies and 
based on the driving force discussed above, an FIT was conceived as a novel iron-
making process at the University of Utah. This technology is based on fine particle 
reduction using a reductant gas such as hydrogen, natural gas, coal gas, or a 
­combination thereof. It is the first flash-type ironmaking process converting iron ore 
concentrate directly to metallic iron in-flight, which would be suitable for an indus-
trial-scale operation. This process will produce iron without requiring pelletization 
or sintering and thus avoids the need for coke. In addition, this process concept 
allows an intensive operation, unlike other alternate ironmaking routes, taking a full 
advantage of the fine particle size of the concentrate with a large surface area which 
permits rapid reduction by a gas. Another potential benefit of this process is the 
­possibility of steelmaking in a single continuous process. This transformative tech-
nology is expected to allow significant energy saving and reduced CO2 emissions 
compared with the blast furnace process.

Finally, when calculating “energy requirements” and presenting the results, it 
should be stated whether or not the chemical heat content (the heat of combustion) 
of a reactant that can also be used as a fuel is included in the calculated value of 
energy requirement. It is advocated using just the “process energy requirement” as 
the standard value of the energy requirement for a process in which a reactant is also 
a fuel.
