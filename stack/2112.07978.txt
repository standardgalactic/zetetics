Quantum and biological systems are seldom discussed together as they seemingly demand oppos-
ing conditions. Life is complex, “hot and wet” whereas quantum objects are small, cold and well
controlled. Here, we overcome this barrier with a tardigrade — a microscopic multicellular organism
known to tolerate extreme physiochemical conditions via a latent state of life known as cryptobiosis.
We observe coupling between the animal in cryptobiosis and a superconducting quantum bit and
prepare a highly entangled state between this combined system and another qubit. The tardigrade
itself is shown to be entangled with the remaining subsystems. The animal is then observed to
return to its active form after 420 hours at sub 10 mK temperatures and pressure of 6 × 10−6 mbar,
setting a new record for the conditions that a complex form of life can survive.
In his highly inﬂuential 1933 lectures titled “Light and Life” [1] Niels Bohr espoused an analogy between physicists’
attempt to characterize the atom and biologists’ attempt to characterize the cell. Living cells are made of ordinary
matter, and therefore fully subject to chemical analysis, but the matter is organized in a complex and intricate way.
Bohr proposed that in order to study the chemistry of the cell, the organization had to be destroyed. On the other
hand, to study the organization, one has to operate at a level at which the chemistry is invisible. Bohr therefore
proposed that the chemical basis of an organism and its organizational hierarchy are complementary properties, and
could never be studied simultaneously.
Here we not only go beyond Bohr’s complementarity by entangling a living system to two superconducting quantum
bits, but we also expose an additional twist in areas where quantum physics, chemistry and biology all overlap. Namely,
the living system we study is a tardigrade which is capable of suspending its living functions for an indeﬁnite amount
of time if the external conditions are deemed to be adverse enough for survival [2]. In that sense, and this is a point
that Bohr certainly missed, it is possible to do a quantum and hence a chemical study of a system, without destroying
its ability to function biologically.
Our experiments could be classiﬁed within the ﬁeld of quantum biology [3] which studies the possibility of quantum
eﬀects in biologically-relevant processes such as photosynthesis [4], olfaction [5] or animal navigation [6], but is also
concerned with quantum features of entire organisms. Along this direction, a systematic body of work with matter-
wave interferometers revealed wave properties of molecules with growing complexity and holds promise for similar
outcomes measured with viruses [7–9].
Living photosynthetic bacteria have been observed to strongly couple to
light [10] and under certain assumptions the results obtained could be interpreted in terms of entanglement between
the quantised light and light-sensitive parts of bacteria [11]. Our experiments involve a multi-cellular eukaryote that is
a much more complex unit of life interacting electrically with quantum bits and for which conclusions about quantum
features are unavoidable.
In our experiments, we use specimens of a Danish population of Ramazzottius varieornatus Bertolani and Kinchin,
1993 (Eutardigrada, Ramazzottiidae). The species belongs to phylum Tardigrada comprising of microscopic inverte-
brate animals with an adult length of 50-1200 µm [12]. Importantly, many tardigrades show extraordinary survival
capabilities [13] and selected species have previously been exposed to extremely low temperatures of 50 mK [14] and
low Earth orbit pressures of 10−19 mbar [15]. Their survival in these extreme conditions is possible thanks to a latent
state of life known as cryptobiosis [2, 13]. Cryptobiosis can be induced by various extreme physicochemical conditions,
including freezing and desiccation. Speciﬁcally, during desiccation, tardigrades reduce volume and contract into an
ametabolic state, known as a “tun”. Revival is achieved by reintroducing the tardigrade into liquid water at atmo-
spheric pressure. In the current experiments, we used dessicated R. varieornatus tuns with a length of 100-150 µm.
Active adult specimens have a length of 200-450 µm. The revival process typically takes several minutes.
We place a tardigrade tun on a superconducting transmon qubit and observe coupling between the qubit and the
tardigrade tun via a shift in the resonance frequency of the new qubit-tardigrade system. This joint qubit-tardigrade
system is then entangled with a second superconducting qubit. We reconstruct the density matrix of this coupled
system experimentally via quantum state tomography. Finally, the tardigrade is removed from the superconducting

FIG. 1:
Sketch of the experiment. a) A tardigrade in the tun state is positioned between the shunt capacitior plates, slightly
oﬀset from the Josephson junction, of the transmon qubit B. Qubit A is on the underside and is capacitively coupled to qubit
B. The full chip is placed within a 3D copper cavity that is mounted inside a dilution refrigerator and connected to standard
microwave electronics for probing. b) Circuit diagram of the two qubits and the tardigrade tun. c) Magniﬁcation of the revived

piece of ﬁlter paper during the experiment.
qubit and reintroduced to atmospheric pressure and room temperature. We observe the resumption of its active
metabolic state in water. Notably, the tardigrade tun remained at a base temperature below 10 mK and pressures
around 6 × 10−6 mbar for 420 hours (see Supplementary Information (SI) for more details). This is to-date the
most extreme exposure to low temperatures and pressures that a tardigrade has been recorded to survive, clearly
demonstrating that the state of cryptobiosis ultimately involves a suspension of all metabolic processes [16, 17] given
that all chemical reactions would be prohibited with all its constituent molecules cooled to their ground states.
Figure 1 shows an illustration of the experiment. Two transmon qubits (‘qubit A’ and ‘qubit B’) are mounted
back to back inside an oxygen-free high thermal-conductivity copper 3D microwave cavity with a TE101 frequency of
4.521 GHz. The two transmons are positioned about 1 mm apart (twice the thickness of the silicon chips). The two
qubits are directly coupled via the shunt capacitor plates on each qubit. We characterize the system using control
and readout schemes typically used in superconducting qubits [18]. The frequency of each qubit is tunable, but is
always biased close to the maximum in our experiments. These correspond to fA = 3.048 GHz for qubit A and
fB = 3.271 GHz for qubit B without tardigrade tun.
For the subsequent cooldown, a single cryptobiotic tardigrade on a 150 µm square piece of cellulose ﬁlter paper is
placed on the substrate of qubit B, in between the shunt capacitor plates of the transmon qubit, with the tardigrade
side closer to the substrate. The ﬁlter paper is suﬃciently displaced from the transmon plane and interacts very weakly
with the transmon electric ﬁelds, veriﬁed with numerical simulations (see Fig. 2a). The maximum frequency of qubit
B is shifted down by 8 MHz to f ′
B = 3.263 GHz, as shown in Fig. 2b, while the maximum frequency of qubit A did
not change signiﬁcantly. The shift can be attributed to the aging of the Josephson junctions and the addition of the
tardigrade itself. The addition of the tardigrade results in a change of the eﬀective dielectric medium and contributes
to the transmon shunt capacitance of qubit B, consequently shifting its frequency. We simulate the electric ﬁelds and
capacitance shifts using ANSYS Maxwell where the tardigrade is modelled as a cube of length 100 µm positioned as
in the experiment and with dielectric constant varied between 4 to 30, typical values for proteins [19] (the ﬁlter paper
is also taken into account and veriﬁed to have small contribution). Fig. 2b shows that the measured frequency shift
corresponds to tardigrade dielectric constant of εr ≈4. Note that this is in the lower range of the dielectric constants

of 20 mV across the shunt capacitor plates (shown in orange). The tardigrade in the tun state was simulated as a cube of
length 100 µm, with dielectric constant of 4, attached to a 150 µm square ﬁlter paper with dielectric constant of 4.5. As seen,
the ﬁlter paper is suﬃciently displaced from the transmon plane and does not interact signiﬁcantly with the electric ﬁelds. b)

observed frequency shift of -8 MHz corresponds to a dielectric constant of about 4 for the tardigrade tun.
for proteins indicating that the contribution from the aging eﬀect is small, in agreement with measurements on qubit
A.
This macroscopic behaviour can be understood with a microscopic model where the charges inside the tardigrade
are represented as eﬀective harmonic oscillators that couple to the electric ﬁeld of the qubit via the dipole mechanism.
This is a modiﬁcation of the two-level systems used to model defects in dielectric structures [20]. Due to this coupling,
the combined system has diﬀerent energy gap as compared to just the bare qubit. We model the charges inside the
tardigrade as a collection of N harmonic oscillators (with possibly diﬀerent frequencies) coupled to the qubit. Due
to the small observed energy shift it is reasonable to assume that the coupling is weak and could be treated as a
perturbation. We therefore split the Hamiltonian and write the following base term
H0 = −1
2ℏωq σz + ℏ
N
X
j=1
ωj a†
jaj,
(1)
where σz is the Pauli-z operator for the qubit with lower (higher) energy state denoted as |0⟩(|1⟩) and aj (a†
j) is the
lowering (raising) operator for the jth oscillator. Note that vanishing energy of the qubit has been set in the middle
between its energy levels and the ground state of each oscillator is assigned energy zero. The perturbation term is
given by the coupling, where again due to weak interaction we also ignore so-called counter-rotating terms capable of
simultaneous excitation of the qubit and an oscillator. Therefore,
V = ℏg
2
N
X
j=1
(a†
jσ−+ ajσ+),
(2)
where for simplicity the same coupling g is used for each oscillator and we write σ+ = |1⟩⟨0| and σ−= |0⟩⟨1|.
One veriﬁes that the ground state of this system is given by |g⟩= |0 . . . 0⟩for any coupling g, i.e. the qubit and
all oscillators are in their respective ground states. The ﬁrst excited state and its energy can be obtained via the
second-order perturbation theory and show the following frequency gap to the ground state:
∆f = 1
2π

ωq + g2

X
j=1

ωq −ωj

.
(3)
Accordingly, if the sum is negative, the frequency diﬀerence is lowered in the presence of interaction. This happens
when there are charges in the tardigrade that oscillate faster than the qubit frequency. We shall also need the explicit

form of the ﬁrst excited state which is found to read:
|e⟩= cos θ
2 |1⟩|0 . . . 0⟩+ sin θ
2 |0⟩|ψ1⟩,
(4)
where the ﬁrst subsystem denotes the qubit and the remaining subsystems describe the oscillators. The state |ψ1⟩
is the superposition of a single excitation in each oscillator, i.e. |ψ1⟩= c1 |10 . . . 0⟩+ · · · + cN |0 . . . 01⟩with suitable
coeﬃcients, and cos θ
2 = 1 −(g2/8) P
j(1/δ2
j ), where δj = ωq −ωj is the detuning. Note that this model reduces to
the well-known Tavis-Cummings model in the case of identical oscillators [21].
For the second part of the experiment, we couple the qubit B-tardigrade system with qubit A using a pulse
sequence shown in Fig. 3. The controlled-NOT gate uses a pulse shape given by Speeding up Waveforms by Inducing
Phases to Harmful Transitions (SWIPHT) protocol [22, 23]. This pulse sequence ideally produces the entangled state
1
√
2(|0A, eBT⟩+|1A, gBT⟩), where we have used subscripts to demarcate the subsystems. To verify the entangled state,
we performed quantum state tomography in the four-dimensional subspace of the whole combined tripartite system.
We applied 16 diﬀerent combinations of one-qubit gates on qubit A and dressed states of the joint qubit B-tardigrade
system. We then jointly readout the state of both qubits using the cavity [24]. Maximum likelihood estimation
[25] was then employed to prevent the resulting density matrix from having nonphysical properties. Comparing the
experimental density matrix with the expected density matrix, we ﬁnd a state ﬁdelity of F = 82 % [26].
In order to understand the entanglement with the tardigrade tun, we ﬁrst expand the dressed states |gBT⟩and |eBT⟩
back into the larger qubit-tardigrade subspace using Eq. (4). Since the states of the oscillators involved in Eq. (4)
are orthogonal, the tardigrade is eﬀectively modeled by a qubit. The density matrix of this three-qubit system (qubit
A - qubit B - tardigrade) can then be reconstructed from the tomographic data (see SI). Using tangles based on
negativity as entanglement quantiﬁers [27–29], we observe that entanglement in various bipartitions of the tripartite
system as well as genuine tripartite entanglement are monotonically increasing function of θ, the coupling strength
between qubit B and tardigrade tun, see Fig. 3. In particular, for any ﬁnite interaction strength the tardigrade is
entangled with both qubits.
The results reported here have been measured in a single experimental sequence, i.e. using one tardigrade in its
tun state. Two more experiments have been conducted and we wish to point out that it is very important for the
revival of the animal to change the external temperature and pressure gently. See SI for their proﬁles that led to the
successful revival.
We conclude by revisiting Bohr’s assertion on the impossibility of conducting quantum experiments with living
organisms. Our present investigation is perhaps the closest realisation combining biological matter and quantum
matter available with present-day technology. While one might expect similar physical results from inanimate object
with similar composition to the tardigrade, we emphasise that entanglement is observed with entire organism that
retains its biological functionality post experiment. At the same time, the tardigrade survived the most extreme and
prolonged conditions it has ever been exposed to, demonstrating that cryptobiosis (latent life) is truly ametabolic.
We hope this will stimulate further experiments with the states of the animal being more and more macroscopically
distinguishable. Our work provides a ﬁrst step in the exciting direction of creating hybrid systems consisting of living
matter and quantum bits.

TARDIGRADES IN THE TUN STATE
In the tun state, the tardigrade legs are withdrawn and the body longitudinally contracted to appear more cuboid
in structure, see Fig.
1 below.
In our experiments, adult specimens of Ramazzottius varieornatus Bertolani and
Kinchin, 1993 (Eutardigrada, Ramazzottiidae) were collected in February 2018 from a roof gutter in Niv˚a, Denmark
(N 55◦56.685’, E 12◦29.775’). The roof gutter sample, containing the tardigrades, was frozen under wet conditions
and stored at −20◦C until October 2020, when the sample was thawed, diluted in ultrapure water (Millipore Milli-Q®
Reference, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and examined for active adult tardigrades with the help of a stereomicro-
scope. Single adult tardigrades were removed from the sample with the aid of hand pulled glass pasteur pipettes and
desiccated on ﬁlter paper substrates for use in the experiments. Subsequent attempts to mechanically remove the
tardigrades from the ﬁlter paper irreversibly damage their cuticle, and hamper their ability to revive in water.

TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE PROFILES
We have attempted three experimental sequences, each one with a diﬀerent tardigrade. A successful revival was
only achieved in the third experimental trial. In this trial a slower venting process was undertaken to implement
gentler pressure gradients on the warmup (room pressure was reintroduced in about 1 hour, while typically it takes
only about 15 minutes). There are no pressure sensors inside the mixing chamber where the qubit and tardigrade
sits. However, the sensors in the outer chambers set an upper limit on the pressures of the mixing chamber. The
pressure and temperature proﬁles in the refrigerator for the experimental run that yielded a successful revival, from
22 Jan 2021 to 25 Jan 2021 (cooldown) and 11 Feb 2021 to 14 Feb 2021 (warmup), are shown in Fig. 2 below. The
cooldown took about 2 days to reach sub 10 mK temperatures while the pressure drop to around 6 × 10−3 mbar took
about half an hour. The ﬁnal pressure is likely to be much lower than 10−6 mbar [1]. The warmup took about 3 days
for temperature and an hour for pressure to return to room values.
FIG. 2: Left: Pressure and temperature proﬁles during the cooldown. Right: Pressure and temperature proﬁles during warmup.
The timezone on the horizontal axis is Singapore Standard Time (GMT +8).
After the cooldown, the pressure and temperature stabilises to around 6 × 10−6 mbar and 10 mK, with some
ﬂuctuations. A typical 12 hour period is shown in Fig. 3.

RECONSTRUCTION OF THE TRIPARTITE DENSITY MATRIX
The experimentally determined 4 × 4 matrix of the tripartite system composed of qubit A, qubit B and tardigrade
tun is not necessarily physical, i.e.
positive semi-deﬁnite with unit trace, due to experimental errors and noise.
Maximum likelihood method was used to reconstruct a physical density matrix ρ closest to the experimental data,
by following the procedure described in Ref. [2]. This density matrix is presented in the main text. Note that it is
written in the basis {|0g⟩, |0e⟩, |1g⟩, |1e⟩}, where the combined states |g⟩and |e⟩of the qubit B - tardigrade system
are used.
In order to isolate the degrees of freedom related to the tardigrade tun we rewrite the density matrix ρ by expanding
states |g⟩and |e⟩. To this end we use Eq. (4) of the main text, which we here repeat for convenience:
|g⟩= |0⟩|0 . . . 0⟩≡|0⟩|0⟩,
(1)
|e⟩= cos θ
2 |1⟩|0 . . . 0⟩+ sin θ
2 |0⟩|ψ1⟩≡cos θ
2 |1⟩|0⟩+ sin θ
2 |0⟩|1⟩,
(2)
where we introduced qubit notation for the tardigrade degrees of freedom using the fact that states |0 . . . 0⟩and
|ψ1⟩are orthogonal. For example, the operator |0g⟩⟨0e| corresponding to the matrix element of ρ is mapped to the
operator in tensor product of three Hilbert spaces:
|0g⟩⟨0e| = cos θ
2 |000⟩⟨010| + sin θ
2 |000⟩⟨001| ,
(3)
and so on. The expression on the right-hand side is written in the following order HA ⊗HB ⊗HT , where the Hilbert
spaces describe qubit A, qubit B and eﬀective qubit for the tardigrade tun, respectively. The reconstructed density
matrix written in this space explicitly depends on the coupling strength θ are reads:

where ρij are the matrix elements of ρ. Note that ρABT admits 28 zero values reﬂecting the assumption that
the system is not energetic enough for simultaneous excitation of qubit B and the tardigrade, i.e.
terms with
|011⟩, |111⟩, ⟨011| , ⟨111| have vanishing corresponding matrix elements. The density matrix ρABT was used to com-
pute entanglement presented in the main text.
ENTANGLEMENT QUANTIFIERS
To quantify various types of entanglement in the tripartite system, we utilise so-called tangles previously deﬁned
in [3]. Let us begin with (doubled) negativity [4] being well-known quantiﬁer of bipartite entanglement:
NX:Y = ||ρTX
XY || −1,
(5)
where ||M|| = Tr
√
M †M is the trace norm of matrix M and TX stands for the partial transpose over subsystem X.
These quantities for various bipartitions involving the tardigrade are plotted in Fig. 3c of the main text.
In order to quantify genuine tripartite entanglement, i.e. entanglement irreducible to pairwise entanglements, we
compute so-called π-tangle as follows:
π = πA + πB + πC

DIELECTRIC MODEL
The transmon is an anharmonic quantum oscillator with the Hamiltonian,
Htr = ℏ

ωj |j⟩⟨j| ,
(10)
where
ωj = (ω −δ
2)j + δ
2j2,
(11)
where δ is the anharmonicity and ℏω =
p
EcEj −Ec, with Ec =
e2
2C being the energy of the shunt capacitor with
capacitance C, and Ej is the Josephson energy associated with the Josephson junction.
By using the transmon as a qubit, we restrict ourselves only to the ground and ﬁrst excited state, allowing us to
neglect the anharmonicity and rewrite the Hamiltonian reduced to this subspace as [5]:
Hq = ω
2 σz.
(12)
Due to the geometry of the transmon qubit, the presence of the tardigrade tun non-trivially increases the relative
permittivity across the shunt capacitor, εr. The relative permittivity was modeled using ﬁnite element method on
ANSYS Maxwell. The altered capacitance, C′ = εrC, then lowers the charging energy and consequently the qubit
frequency.
