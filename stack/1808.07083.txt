General relativity as a biconformal gauge theory
James T. Wheeler†
April 18, 2019
Abstract
We consider the conformal group of a space of dim n = p + q, with SO(p,q) metric. The quotient of
this group by its homogeneous Weyl subgroup gives a principal ﬁber bundle with 2n-dim base manifold
and Weyl ﬁbers. The Cartan generalization to a curved 2n-dim geometry admits an action functional
linear in the curvatures.
Because symmetry is maintained between the translations and the special
conformal transformations in the construction, these spaces are called biconformal; this same symmetry
gives biconformal spaces overlapping structures with double ﬁeld theories, including manifest T-duality.
We establish that biconformal geometry is a form of double ﬁeld theory, showing how general relativity
with integrable local scale invariance arises from its ﬁeld equations. While we discuss the relationship
between biconformal geometries and the double ﬁeld theories of T-dual string theories, our principal
interest is the study of the gravity theory. We show that vanishing torsion and vanishing co-torsion
solutions to the ﬁeld equations overconstrain the system, implying a trivial biconformal space.
Wih
co-torsion unconstrained, we show that (1) the torsion-free solutions are foliated by copies of an n-dim
Lie group, (2) torsion-free solutions generically describe locally scale-covariant general relativity with
symmetric, divergence-free sources on either the co-tangent bundle of n-dim (p,q)-spacetime or the torus
of double ﬁeld theory, and (3) torsion-free solutions admit a subclass of spacetimes with n-dim non-
abelian Lie symmetry. These latter cases include the possibility of a gravity-electroweak uniﬁcation. It
is notable that the ﬁeld equations reduce all curvature components to dependence only on the solder
form of an n-dim Lagrangian submanifold, despite the increased number of curvature components and
doubled number of initial independent variables.

Introduction
1.1
Biconformal spaces and the biconformal action
It was shown in the 1950s and 1960s that general relativity may be cast as a Lorentz [1] or Poincaré [2] gauge
theory. Subsequent approaches [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] reﬁned the methods and extended the initial symmetry to
Weyl, deSitter and conformal. A systematic approach to the resulting gauge theories of gravity shows that
it is possible to formulate general relativity in several ways [10].
1.1.1
Conformally based theories of gravity
Generally, the use of conformal symmetries for gravity theories (and in the MacDowell-Mansouri case, de
Sitter) leads to actions functionals which are quadratic in the curvature and apply only to 4-dimensional
spacetimes. This is because conformal scaling by eφ changes the volume form by enφ in n-dimensions. In
four dimensions this factor may be oﬀset by two factors of the curvature, but in even dimension n = 2k,
we require k factors of the curvature to make the action dimensionless.
Various techniques allow these
quadratic theories to nonetheless reduce to general relativity [4, 8, 9, 11]. The most studied case is that
of Weyl (conformal) gravity, in which the diﬃculty of higher order ﬁeld equations has been alternatively
exploited and overcome. When only the metric is varied, the ﬁeld equations are fourth order, and include
solutions not found in general relativity [12, 13, 14]. Mannheim [15] attempts to use the additional scaling
properties to explain galactic rotation curves (but also see [16]). Alternatively, it has been shown in [17]
that by reformulating Weyl gravity as a gauge theory and varying all of the gauge ﬁelds, the additional ﬁeld
equations give the integrability conditions needed to reduce the order and exactly reproduce locally scale
invariant general relativity.
There are two exceptions to these higher-order curvature requirements, which have actions linear in the
curvature and can be formulated in any dimension. In the ﬁrst of the two approaches, Dirac [3] builds on
previous work with scalar-tensor theories [18, 19, 20, 21], achieving a curvature-linear action by including
a scalar ﬁeld to help oﬀset the scaling of the volume form. Dirac considers a Weyl geometry in which the
curvature is coupled to the Weyl vector and a scalar ﬁeld. Generalizing his action functional to n-dimensions,
it takes the form
S =
ˆ 
κ2gαβRαβ −β
2 κ2( n−4
n−2)gαµgβνΩαβΩµν −4 (n −1)
n −2
gαβDακDβκ −λκ
2n
n−2
 √−gdnx
where κ is a scalar ﬁeld of conformal weight wκ = −n−2
2
and Ωαβ = Wα,β−Wβ,α is the dilatational curvature.
The only occurrence of the Weyl vector is in the dilatational curvature, Ωαβ, which must vanish or be
unmeasurably small to avoid unphysical size changes. Dirac interpreted Ωαβ as the electromagnetic ﬁeld and
the time dependence of the scalar ﬁeld κ as a time-dependent gravitational constant. The electromagnetic
interpretation is untenable, but solutions with Ωαβ = 0 or with other interpretations remain to be explored.
The second curvature-linear action arises when the volume element is like that of a phase space, since the
“momentum” directions have opposite conformal weight from the “space” dimensions. Such a space arises
naturally from the quotient of the conformal group by its Weyl subgroup (SO (p, q) and dilatations), with
the most general curvature-linear action built from the SO (p, q) and dilatational curvatures [11] being
S =
ˆ
e
be···f
ac···d
(αΩa
b + βδa
bΩ+ γea ∧fb) ∧ec ∧· · · ∧ed ∧fe ∧· · · ∧ff
(1)
Here, Ωa
b is the curvature of the SO (p, q) gauge ﬁeld, Ωis the dilatational curvature, and α, β and γ are
dimensionless constants. The diﬀerential forms ea and fa are the gauge ﬁelds of translations and special con-
formal transformations, respectively. Together the latter give an orthonormal frame ﬁeld on a 2n-dimensional
manifold. Because of the symmetry maintained between the translations of the conformal group and the
special conformal transformations, these spaces are called biconformal. Here we explore the large class of
torsion-free biconformal spaces, showing that they reduce to general relativity on Lagrangian submanifolds.
It is the consequences of the action, Eq.(1) that will occupy our present inquiry.

1.1.2
The biconformal gauging
The construction of a biconformal space begins with a ﬂat, n-dimensional space with SO (p, q) invariant
metric, p + q = n. Compactifying this space by adding an appropriate point or null cones at inﬁnity (See
Appendix A) allows us to deﬁne its conformal group, SO (p + 1, q + 1). The biconformal quotient [8, 9] is
then SO (p + 1, q + 1) /SO(p, q) × SO (1, 1), where SO (1, 1) transformations represent dilatations and the
full subgroup W ≡SO(p, q)×SO (1, 1) is the homogeneous Weyl group. The quotient gives rise to a principal
ﬁber bundle with 2n dimensional base manifold and homogeneous Weyl ﬁbers. The connection of this ﬂat
biconformal space is then generalized, giving rise to conformal Lie algebra-valued 2-form curvatures. These
are required to be horizontal and the resulting Cartan equations integrable. The 2n-dimensional curved
base manifolds are biconformal spaces while local SO (p, q) and dilatational invariance remain, together
comprising the biconformal bundle.
Biconformal gravity is the gravity theory following from variation of the action, Eq.(1), with respect to
each of the conformal gauge ﬁelds, together with the Cartan structure equations to deﬁne the curvatures
in terms of the connection, and the generalized Bianchi identities arising as integrability conditions. The
construction of these models is described in full detail in [22]. See also [8, 9, 11, 23].
1.2
Relationship to double ﬁeld theory
Biconformal spaces share many features in common with double ﬁeld theories.
Double ﬁeld theory is a means of making the O (d, d) symmetry of T -duality manifest. By introducing
scalars to produce an additional d dimension, Duﬀ[27] doubled the X(σ, τ) string variables to make this
O (d, d) symmetry manifest. Siegel brought the idea to full fruition by deriving results from superstring theory
[24, 25, 26]. Allowing ﬁelds to depend on all 2d coordinates, Siegel introduced generalized Lie brackets, gauge
transformations, covariant derivatives, and a section condition on the full doubled space, thereby introducing
torsions and curvatures in addition to the manifest T-duality.
There has been substantial subsequent development.
Much of this development is reviewed in [28];
the introduction to [29] gives a concise summary. Brieﬂy, double ﬁeld theory arises by making T -duality
manifest in string theory. When we compactify n dimensions on a torus, the windings of string about the
torus can be interpreted as momenta. T -duality is a mapping between the original spatial directions and
these momenta. Double ﬁeld theory arises when these two n-spaces are kept present simultaneously, making
T -duality manifest and leading to an overall O (n, n) symmetry. The T -duality is identiﬁed with the Weyl
group of O (n, n), consisting of permutations of the distinct circles of the maximum torus and interchange
of phases.
1.2.1
Invariant tensors in double ﬁeld theory and biconformal spaces
In double ﬁeld theory, doubled coordinates are introduced, extending the spacetime coordinate xα by an
equal number of momenta,
xM =

xα
yβ

where M, N, · · · = 1, · · · , 2n and α, β, · · · = 1, · · · , n are coordinate indices. There are at least two important
invariant tensors identiﬁed in [29]. Deﬁning the O (n, n) symmetry, there is the 2n × 2n quadratic form
KAB =
 0
δa
b
δb
a
0

with A, B, · · · , L = 1, · · · , 2n and lower case Latin indices, a, b, · · · = 1, · · · , n orthonormal. The second
invariant object is the spacetime/dual generalized metric, Mab, built from the spacetime metric and the
Kalb-Ramond potential, which takes the orthonormal form
MAB =
 ηab
0
0
ηab

5

where ηab is either Euclidean or Lorentzian, depending on the model considered.
These are only half the invariant structures in biconformal spaces, all of which arise from natural invari-
ances of the conformal group. Again letting ηab be Euclidean or Lorentzian (or in our main development,
any (p, q) metric), we make use of the Killing form of the conformal group of a compactiﬁed (p, q) space,
KΣ∆=

where the upper left block is the norm on Lorentz or Euclidean transformations, the next n rows and columns
arise from tranlations and the next n from special conformal transformations. The ﬁnal 1 in the lower right
gives the Killing norm on dilatations. Upper case Greek indices run over the dimension of the conformal
group. When KΣ∆is restricted to the biconformal manifold, we have only the translations and special
conformal portion, and this is precisely the O (n, n) metric,
KAB =
 0
δa

δb


Use of the Killing form as metric was ﬁrst mentioned in [9] with explicit use in biconformal spaces in
[30, 31, 22] where the orthonormal basis (ea, fb) is taken to satisfy

ea, eb
=
0
(2)
⟨ea, fb⟩

(3)
⟨fa, fb⟩

General linear changes of the original (ea, fb) basis are allowed,
χa
=
Aa
beb + Babfb
(5)
ψa
=
Cabeb + D
b
a fb
(6)
These become O (n, n) transformations when they are required to preserve the inner product given in Eqs.(2)
- (4). These basis forms (χa, ψb) are local, but may be deﬁned globally when the structure equations and
ﬁeld equations provide an appropriate involution. Such alternative choices of basis have been explored in
[31, 22, 32].
There are further objects, discussed in detail in [31] and more comprehensively in [22], where it is shown
that there exists a Kähler structure on biconformal space. The complex structure arises from the symmetry of
the conformal Lie algebra given by interchanging translation and special conformal transformation generators
and changing the sign of the dilatation generator. This is essentially an inversion, and when carried through
to its eﬀect as a linear operation on the basis forms, may be written as
JA
B
=

0
−ηab
ηab
0

Further, it has long been recognized that the Maurer-Cartan equation of dilatations and, generically, its
Cartan generalization describe a symplectic form,
dω
=
ea ∧fa
The symplectic character is manifest since the left side shows the 2-form to be closed while the right shows
it to be non-degenerate. As a matrix in this basis, the symplectic form is
SAB =

The two of these may be used to deﬁne a Kähler metric via

which is exactly the MAB of double ﬁeld theory. All of these objects arise from properties of the conformal
group. We note that the Killing metric KAB is not the metric deﬁned by the almost Kähler structure.
The change of basis of Eq.(5) and Eq.(6) will be restricted further depending on which of these objects
the change is required to preserve. For example, the time theorem of [31] requires invariance of the inner
product, Eqs.(2) - (4), and preservation of the symplectic form, SAB, reducing the allowed change of basis
to the form

This is simply an instance of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Solutions typically do not preserve the full
symmetry of a system of equations.
1.2.2
Connection and action
The principal diﬀerences between the usual treatment of double ﬁeld theories and biconformal gravity lie
in the connection, the action, and the means by which the doubled dimension is reduced back to an n-
dimensional spacetime.
There have been multiple proposals for a connection in dual ﬁeld theory [29], including the Weitzenböch
connection, ΓA
BC = e
A
M ∂Be
M
C
. While this is compatible with the double ﬁeld theory structures, it leads to
vanishing curvature and nonvanishing torsion. Even its generalization has vanishing curvature. Constructing
an action becomes problematic. One proposal, given in [29], is an action on the full doubled space given by
S
=
ˆ
dxdye−2dL
where d = Φ −1
2 ln (|deg gij|) generalizes the dilaton Φ and L is given by
L

−4M AB∂Ad∂Bd + 4∂AM AB∂Bd + 1
2ηABηCD∂Ae
M
C
∂BeDM
There are also multiple proposals in double ﬁeld theory for ﬁnding a condition that will reduce the full
space back to an n-dimensional spacetime. One proposal [33], due to Scherk and Schwarz, proposes requiring
the functional dependence of ﬁelds to be of the form
V A
B (X, Y ) =
 W −1A
ˆ
A (Y ) W
ˆ
B
B (Y )
h
ˆV (x)
i ˆ
A
ˆ
B
with the scalar ﬁeld additively separable, d (X, Y ) = ˆd (X) + λ (Y ). Here the hatted indices, ˆA, refer to the
gauged double ﬁeld theory while unhatted A, B are associated to the double ﬁeld theory before applying the
Scherk-Schwarz reduction. Alternatively, Berman et al. [29] propose additive separability with the “section
condition” ηAB∂A∂B = 0 acting on all ﬁelds.
Faced with these divergent approaches, the authors of [29] summarize a set of desirable properties for a
connection on double ﬁeld theory. We quote (replacing their notation with ours and numbering the points
for convenient reference below):

“. . . we might want it to
1. deﬁne a covariant derivative that maps generalised tensors into generalised tensors,
2. be compatible with the generalised metric MAB,
3. be compatible with the O (n, n) structure KAB,
4. be completely determined in terms of the physical ﬁelds, in particular the vielbein and its derivatives,
5. be torsion-free,
6. lead to a curvature that may be contracted with the metric to give the scalar which appears in the
action.”
Their proposal satisﬁes conditions 1 −4.
The situation is quite diﬀerent in biconformal geometry because it has been developed ﬁrst as a gravity
theory, and all the relevant structures are present from the Cartan construction. In particular, the connection
is automatically given by the SO (p, q) spin connection and the Weyl vector, and these are compatible with
not only the generalized metric (the biconformal Kähler metric) MAB and the O (n, n) structure KAB present
as the restricted conformal Killing form, but also the almost complex structure JA
B and symplectic form
SAB. This satisﬁes points 1, 2 and 3.
While an O (n) rather than an O (n, n) connection may seem restrictive, O (n, n) transformations of the
orthonormal basis still retain the larger symmetry. Moreover, the spin connection and Weyl vector start as
general 1-forms on a 2n-dimensional space,
ωa
b
=
ωa
bc (xα, yβ) ec (xα, yβ) + ωa
c
b
(xα, yβ) fc (xα, yβ)
(7)
ω
=
Wc (xα, yβ) ec (xα, yβ) + W c (xα, yβ) fc (xα, yβ)
(8)
It is because the spin connection performs the same O (n) rotation simultaneously on each subspace that it
is able to preserve the multiple structures. In fact, Eq.(7) displays far more generality than we ultimately
want: we would like for all ﬁelds to be determined purely the the spacetime solder form, ec (xα), and
this will require reduction of both components (e.g., (ωa
bc, ωa
c
b
) →ωa
bc) and of independent variables
((xα, yβ) →xα). Accomplishing this will satisfy point 4 above, and this is the central accomplishment of
the current presentation.
The only assumption we make, beyond the Cartan biconformal construction and the the ﬁeld equations
following from the action (1), is vanishing torsion. This is a natural constraint for a spacetime gravity theory,
is consistent with existing measurements in general relativity, and satisﬁes point 5.
Point 6 is satisﬁed by the action, (1), which despite retaining scale invariance, is linear in the biconformal
curvatures. Notice that the α term in Eq.(1) is completely analogous to the Einstein-Hilbert action written
in similar language, i.e., SEH =
´
Rab ∧ec ∧. . . ∧edεabc···d.
We therefore claim that the reduction presented here satisﬁes all six desired conditions.
1.3
Additional potential advantages
There are further potential advantages of biconformal models.
The biconformal theory developed here also overlaps strongly with calculations in twistor space. Twistor
space, in arbitrary dimension, is the space of spinors of the conformal group, up to projection by an overall
factor. Witten showed in [34] (see also [35, 36, 37]) that when a topological string theory is formulated
in twistor space it is equivalent to N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Most notably, twistor string
theory provided a string/gauge theory equivalence that allowed remarkably eﬃcient calculations of scatter-
ing amplitudes for gauge theory, reducing months of supercomputer calculations to fewer than two dozen
integrals. The eﬀort slowed considerably when it was thought that it would necessarily lead to fourth order
Weyl gravity instead of general relativity. While a few alternative formulations were found, Mason was led
to conclude [37]:

Clearly, more work is required to discover what other twistor–string theories can be constructed.
In particular, one would like to have twistor–string theories that give rise to Poincaré supergrav-
ities, or to pure super-Yang–Mills, or that incorporate other representations of the gauge and
Lorentz groups.
Biconformal gravity might be an ideal ground state for twistor string since it arises from conformal symmetry,
maintains scale invariance, and reduces to general relativity. It is therefore of interest to formulate twistor
string theory in a biconformal space. These will naturally use the spinor representation, as in the supergravity
extension of biconformal space [38].
Biconformal spaces also seem well suited to string compactiﬁcation. In the present work, we show that
these 2n-dimensional gravity theories reduce via their ﬁeld equations to n-dimensional general relativity. As a
result, a string theory written in a 10-dimensional biconformal background will require only two dimensional
compactiﬁcation to describe 4-dimensional general relativity.
There are only a countable number of 2-
dimensional topologies, compared to the truly huge number of 6-dimensionsal compact spaces available
when going from 10 directly to 4-dimensions.
The situation is even more restrictive than all 2-dimensional compact spaces because the compactiﬁcation
is required to go between two biconformal spaces. It therefore must include one basis direction of each
conformal weight. This necessarily restricts the compactiﬁcation to a 2-torus or possibly a 2-sphere.
1.4
Organization
The organization of the paper begins with the basic equations of biconformal gravity, including some no-
tational conventions and ending with the ﬁeld equations. In Section 3, we show the eﬀects of vanishing
torsion on the remaining curvatures, using the Bianchi identites and ﬁeld equations to reduce the number of
components. From the eﬀect of vanishing torsion on the curvtures, it is immediate to see by symmetry that
if the co-torsion were also to be set to zero, the additional constraints would force the solution to be trivial.
We begin solving for the connection in Section 4 by making use of the Frobenius theorem on the involution
of the solder form. This clariﬁes the meaning of the doubled dimension, showing that the biconformal space
is foliated by an n-dimensional Lie group. This foliation may be interpreted as the translation group of the
co-tangent bundle, the torus of double ﬁeld theory, or as a new, nonabelian internal symmetry.
In Section ??, we extend the partial solution for the connection from the involution back to the full
biconformal space and substitute into each structure equation to ﬁnd the resulting form of the curvatures,
then use these results to reduce the ﬁeld equations. From this point on, the solution divides into two cases
depending on whether the Lie group of the foliation is abelian or non-abelian. Each of these cases merits a
Section (6,??). Finally, we summarize our results in Section 8.

The ﬁeld equations of biconformal gravity
The ﬁrst construction of the biconformal quotient was carried out by Ivanov and Niederle [8], who used it to
describe a gravity theory using a curvature-quadratic action. Subsequently, the geometry was revived [9] and
a curvature-linear action was introduced [11] to give biconformal gravity. The details of the construction
are given in [22], along with a demonstration of the signature-changing properties derived in [31]. Here,
we rely on the speciﬁcs given in [22], providing only a basic description and introducing some convenient
nomenclature, then moving quickly to the Cartan structure equations, Bianchi identities, and the linear
action.
From the action, we ﬁnd the ﬁeld equations and study their consequences with only the assumption of
vanishing torsion. Throughout, we work in arbitrary dimension with arbitrary signature for the conformal
metric class.

2.1
Building the structure equations
Consider a space of dimension n = p+ q, with an SO (p, q)-symmetric orthonormal metric η. We compactify
with appropriate null cones at inﬁnity, to permit the inversions that give the space a well-deﬁned conformal
symmetry, C = SO (p + 1, q + 1). The homogeneous Weyl subgroup W = SO (p, q) × SO (1, 1) ⊂C consists
of the pseudo-rotations and dilatations. The quotient C/W is a 2n-dimensional homogeneous manifold from
which we immediately have a principal ﬁber bundle with ﬁber symmetry W. We take the local structure of
this bundle as a model for a curved space à la Cartan, modifying the manifold (if desired) and altering the
connection subject to two conditions:
1. The resulting curvature 2-forms must be horizontal.
2. The resulting Cartan structure equations satisfy their integrability conditions (generalized Bianchi
identities).
Let the connection forms dual to the generators of the Lie algebra be written as ωa
b (SO (p, q) transforma-
tions), ea (translations), fa (special conformal transformations, called co-translations in the context of these
biconformal geometries), and ω (dilatations). Then the Cartan structure equations are:
dωa
b
=
ωc
b ∧ωa
c + 2∆ad
cb fd ∧ec + Ωa
b
(9)

eb ∧ωa
b + ω ∧eb + Ta
(10)
dfa
=
ωb
a ∧fb + fa ∧ω + Sa
(11)
dω
=
ea ∧fa + Ω
(12)
Horizontality requires the curvature to be expanded in the (ea, fb) basis, giving each of the components
(Ωa
b, Ta, Sa, Ω) the general form
ΩA = 1
2ΩA
cd ec ∧ed + ΩAc
d fc ∧ed + 1
2ΩAcd fc ∧fd
(13)
and integrability follows from the Poincaré lemma, d2 ≡0.
The (n−1)(n+2)
2
curvature components (Ωa
b, Ta, Sa, Ω) together comprise a single conformal curvature
tensor. However, the local symmetries of the homogeneous Weyl symmetry of the biconformal bundle do not
mix these four separate parts. Thereofore, we call the SO (p, q) part of the full conformal curvature Ωa
b the
curvature, the translational part of the curvature Ta the torsion, the special conformal part of the curvature
the co-torsion, Sa, and the dilatational portion Ωthe dilatational curvature or simply the dilatation.
Each of the curvatures each has three distinguishable parts, as seen in Eq.(13). We call the ea ∧eb term
the spacetime term, the fa ∧eb term the cross term, and the fa ∧fb term the momentum term. While it
may be somewhat abusive to call a signature (p, q) space “spacetime”, for the gravitational applications we
consider the name is ultimately appropriate. In the cases where the co-solder forms generate a nonabelian
Lie group, the name “momentum” is not appropriate, and we will speak of the relevant group manifold.
To avoid introducing too many symbols, the symbols for the three parts of curvatures are distinguished
purely by index position. Thus, Ωa
c
b
d denotes the cross-term of the SO (p, q) curvature and Ωa
bcd the
spacetime term of the SO (p, q) curvature. These are independent functions. We therefore do not raise or
lower indices unless, on some submanifold, there is no chance for ambiguity. Note also that the raised and
lowered index positions indicate the conformal weights, +1 and −1 respectively, of all deﬁnite weight objects.
Therefore, the torsion cross-term T ab
c has net conformal weight +1, the spacetime term of the co-torsion
Sabc has conformal weight −3, and the full torsion 2-form Ta has conformal weight +1.
Note the similarity between Eqs.(10) and (11).
This occurs because, by taking the quotient of the
conformal group by its homogeneous Weyl subgroup instead of the more common inhomogeneous Weyl
group, symmetry is maintained between the translations and the special conformal transformations. Indeed,
in their action on the deﬁning compactiﬁed (p, q) space, the special conformal transformations are simply
translations in inverse coordinates, yµ = xµ
x2 . As a result, they behave near inﬁnity exactly as translations do
at the origin; correspondingly, the eﬀect of a simple translation expressed in inverse coordinates is the same
10

as that of a special conformal transformation at the origin. In the biconformal space, the resulting gauge
ﬁeld of translations, ea, and the gauge ﬁeld of special conformal transformations, fa, form a cotangent basis.
Each locally spans an n-dimensional subspace of the full biconformal cotangent space, which we ultimately
show to be submanifolds. In parallel to calling ea the solder form, we call fa the co-solder form. Similarly,
just as the ﬁeld strength of the solder form is called the torsion, Ta, we refer to the ﬁeld strength of the
co-solder form as the co-torsion, Sa.
2.2
Bianchi identities
The generalized Bianchi identities are the integrability conditions for the Cartan equations. They are found
by applying the Poincaré lemma, d2 ≡0, to each structure equation, then using the structure equations
again to eliminate all but curvature terms. They always give covariant expressions – we are guaranteed that
all purely connection terms must cancel because when all curvatures vanish the Cartan equations reduce to
the Maurer-Cartan equations, for which the integrability conditions are the Jacobi identities, and therefore
are automatically satisﬁed.
Knowing that all connection terms must cancel when we replace exterior derivatives with the correspond-
ing curvatures makes it easier to derive the identities. Furthermore, every exterior derivative of a curvature
becomes a covariant derivative. Using this knowledge, we may quickly ﬁnd the identities. Thus, for the
SO (p, q) curvature, we take the exterior derivative of Eq.(9),

through Eqs.(9) - (12), we ﬁnd the full set of integrability conditions,

(18)
Since each Bianchi identity contains the covariant derivative of a curvature, it is typically diﬃcult to use
them to help ﬁnd solutions to the ﬁeld equations. They are simply the conditions on the curvatures that
guarantee that a solution exists, and if we ﬁnd a solution to the ﬁeld equations, the Bianchi identities are
necessarily satisﬁed. However, if one of the curvatures vanishes the relations become algebraic and can be
extremely helpful.
2.3

2.3.1
Notational conventions
The metric is ηab with pseudo-rotational invariance under SO (p, q), p + q = n. Lower case Latin indices
run a, b . . . = 1, 2 . . ., n, and refer to orthonormal frames (ea, fa). When coordinates are introduced they are
11

given Greek indices. Thus, we may write
ea = e a
µ dxµ + eµadyµ
Until we have established appropriate submanifolds, we cannot use the components of the solder form, e

to change basis.

The volume form
The volume form is unusual, having two types of index. Since we can distinguish the conformal weight +1
solder forms ea from the conformal weight −1 co-solder forms, fa, we can always partially re-arrange. Thus,

thereby reducing the (2n)! permutations to n!n!. Locally (and globally once submanifolds are established),
there exist distinguishable subspaces on which we may write eab...c
de...f as a pair of n-dim Levi-Civita tensors,
eab...c
de...f = eab...cede...f
This convention means that a contraction, eab...c
ae...f is meaningful, when it would vanish immediately with
the full antisymmetrization. This is, nonetheless, correct since there exists an unambiguous local separation
by conformal weight, each with its own induced volume form. Since variation of the action is local, we may
use this to ﬁnd the ﬁeld equations. A single contraction gives eab...c
ae...f = δb...c
e...f and in general, contracting
all but k pairs of indices,
εc···de···fεa···bg···h = (−1)q (k −1)! (n −k + 1)!δc···d
a···b
(19)
The presence of this conformal separation also allows the dilatational curvature to be included as the β term
in the action. It may be argued that this is not allowed if the subspaces are not integrable. We ﬁnd that
the subspaces are integrable, but have checked that setting β = 0 throughout does not alter any of our
conclusions.
12

There exist conditions that guarantee that such a splitting into subspaces is integrable across the full
biconformal space. For example, the ea subspace is certainly integrable to a submanifold if the basis structure
equation,
dea
=
eb ∧ωa
b + ω ∧ea + Ta
is in involution, and this is true if the torsion Ta is suitably restricted. Speciﬁcally, if the momentum term
of the torsion vanishes, T acd = 0, then the Eq.(13) for the torsion reduces to
Ta
=
1
2T a
cdec ∧ed + T ac
dfc ∧ed
(20)
and ea is in involution. Similarly, the co-solder equation will be involute provided Sacd = 0.
We make no assumptions about the torsion or co-torsion in deriving the ﬁeld equations. Though neither
occurs explicitly in the curvature-linear action, integrations by parts after variation nonetheless introduce
them into the ﬁeld equations.
We deﬁne the Hodge dual of unity as a convenient volume form,

2.4
The action functional
Eq.(1) is the most general action linear in biconformal curvatures. It is deﬁned on the 2n-dimensional base
manifold of the bundle, spanned by (ea, fa). The initial conformally symmetric space has metric ηab of any
dimension n > 2 and any signature (p, q).
We ﬁnd the ﬁeld equations by varying the full set of connection 1-forms, {ωa
b, ea, fa, ω}. Each variation
has two parts when we expand in the (ea, fb) basis, for example,
δωa
b = δAa
bcec + δBa
c

with δAa
bc and δBa

independent, arbitrary variations. We therefore ﬁnd eight sets of ﬁeld equations. To
illustrate details of the variation technique, the variation of the spin connection ωa

Carrying out each of the connection variations, we arrive at the ﬁnal ﬁeld equations:

Biconformal spaces
The system we wish to study consists of the structure equations Eqs.(9)-(12), their associated Bianchi
identities Eqs.(14)-(17), and the ﬁeld equations Eqs.(23)-(30).
These have been written above with no
additional conditions, and they apply to the biconformal geometry constructed from the conformal group in
any dimension n and any signature (p, q).
Our goal is to show how the full set of biconformal curvatures in 2n-dimensions reduces to only those
required to describe n-dimensional general relativity. Assuming only vanishing torsion and the ﬁeld equations,
we show in the next Section that the curvatures, each initially in the general form given in Eq. (13), reduce
to

In Sections (4) and (??), we use the structure equations to reduce the coordinate dependence to xα only,
with the exception of a few explicit terms linear in yα. There is also further reduction of the curvatures.
3
Reducing the curvatures of torsion-free biconformal spaces
We seek to reduce the ﬁeld equations as far as possible. In particular, we will show that scale-invariant general
relativity emerges from the vanishing torsion ﬁeld equations. As in Riemannian geometry, vanishing torsion
is a natural constraint on the full generality of a biconformal space. This has three deﬁnite consequences
corresponding to the three parts in the expansion given by Eq.(13),
Ta = 1
2T a
cdec ∧ed + T ac
dfc ∧ed + 1
2T acdfc ∧fd
We expect the ﬁrst term in this expansion to give the spacetime torsion, which is zero in general relativity.
The cross term, T ac
dfc∧ed, gives the extrinsic curvature of the spacetime submanifold in the full space, while
the ﬁnal term measures the non-involution – the degree to which the solder form fails to be in involution [23].
Taking the full torsion to vanish therefore has clear geometric consequences: it guarantees the existence of a
spacetime submanifold with vanishing spacetime torsion, embeded with no extrinsic curvature in the larger
biconformal space.
14

Note that it is important that we do not constrain the co-torsion. Indeed, we show at the end of this
Section that setting both torsion and co-torsion to zero is overly restrictive, forcing the full space to have at
most constant curvature and dilatation. Naturally, setting the torsion but not the co-torsion to zero breaks
some of the symmetry between the solder form and the co-solder form. It would be equivalent to break the
symmetry the other way, setting the co-torsion to zero and not the torsion.
We begin with the consequences of vanishing torsion in the Bianchi identities.
3.1
Consequences of the Bianchi identities
If the torsion vanishes, Ta = 0, then the second Bianchi identity, eq.(15), becomes an algebraic condition on
the curvature and dilatation:
eb ∧Ωa
b
=
Ω∧ea
Expanding each of the curvatures in components,

Note in particular that since Ωa

is antisymmetric on ab, the trace gives Ωa

condition requires
Ωcd = 0
(34)
and therefore, the momentum space component of the SO (p, q) curvature vanishes,
Ωa
cd
b
= 0
(35)
The cross-term Bianchi may be used to express the cross curvature in terms of the cross dilatation.

Vanishing torsion also aﬀects the remaining Bianchi identities, but the eﬀects are most pronounced when
those are combined with the ﬁeld equations.
Therefore, we turn next to the simpliﬁcation of the ﬁeld
equations.
15

3.2
Simpliﬁcations of the torsion and co-torsion equations
Of the torsion and co-torsion equations, the ﬁrst two relate various traces. Equations (23) and (24) identify
two relationships between these traces. When the torsion vanishes, these become

There is only one independent contraction of the cross-term, and it determines the antisymmetric part of
the full cross-term.
3.3
Simpliﬁcations of the curvature and dilatation equations
Now consider the remaining four equations for the curvature and dilatation, Eqs.(27) - (30). Eq.(30) is
already satisﬁed by the consequences of the torsion Bianchi identity, Eqs.(34) and (35). The diﬀerence of
the two cross curvature equations, Eq.(27) and Eq.(29), shows the equality of the traces,
Ωa

Combining this with the ﬁeld equation, Eq.(28), for the corresponding components, Ωa
bac = −β
αΩbc, we have
((n −2) α −2β) Ωbc
=
0
so the spacetime dilatation generically vanishes. The ﬁeld equation then implies
Ωab

(44)
The special case when ((n −2) α −2β) = 0 allows a non-integrable Weyl geometry and, likely being unphys-
ical, will not concern us further.
Because of the constant form of the components of the dilatation, Eq.(41), the dilatation Bianchi identity
gives constraints on the co-torsion. Starting with Eq.(17) with vanishing torsion and the complete dilatation
now given by Ω= χeafa, Eq.(17) gives

For generic constants in the action we may cancel the 1+χ factor, but the χ = −1 case permits the presence
of a non-abelian internal symmetry.

A theorem: Vanishing torsion and co-torsion
We digress brieﬂy to prove a useful result. From our results so far, we can easily prove the following theorem.
We start with the deﬁnition of a ﬂat and trivial biconformal space. Because of the “cosmological constant”
term Λ in Eqs.(27) and (29), we cannot, in general, set all curvatures to zero unless Λ = 0 as well. We therefore
deﬁne a ﬂat biconformal space [9] to have vanishing curvatures and Λ = 0, and a trivial biconformal space
to have vanishing curvatures except for constant curvature and dilatation cross-terms, which then have the
Λ-dependent forms given in Eqs.(41) and (42). That these constant values of the curvatures yield solutions
to the ﬁeld equations follows as a special case of the generic torsion free solution below.
Triviality Theorem : Biconformal spaces in which both the torsion and the co-torsion vanish are trivial
biconformal spaces.
Proof: With vanishing torsion, we have already seen that the momentum curvature and dilatation vanish.
By the symmetry of biconformal spaces, zero co-torsion requires the spacetime curvature and dilatation
to vanish as well. Since, by assumption we have both Ta = 0 and Sa = 0, the only nonvanishing
curvature components are the dilatation and curvature cross-terms, shown above to necessarily have
the forms given in Eqs.(41) and (42),
Ωa
b

−χδa
b
Ωa
c

d

vanishing if and only if χ ≡
1
n−1
1
α(n−1)−βΛ is zero. The biconformal space is therefore trivial.
17

There are interesting properties to trivial biconformal spaces. These homogeneous manifolds have been shown
to be Kähler [22], and allow time to emerge as part of the solution from the properties of the underlying
conformal group [31, 22].
Still, there can be no spacetime or momentum space curvature if both the torsion and the co-torsion
vanish completely, and therefore no local gravity. To achieve a meaningful gravity theory it is necessary that
at least part of either the torsion or the co-torsion remains nonzero.
3.5
Summary of curvatures and remaining ﬁeld equations
Initially, the four curvatures (“curvature”, torsion, co-torsion, and dilatation) have the three independent

Even when 1 + χ ̸= 0, the equations involving the co-torsion cross-term do not determine the co-torsion
further; we must turn to the structure equations to proceed.
While the severe restrictions evident in Eqs.(46) reduce the space considerably toward an n-dimensional
theory, the remaining ﬁelds are still functions of all 2n coordinates. It is only by using the structure equations
that we fully reduce the theory to n-dimensional scale-covariant general relativity.

The meaning of the doubled dimension
With Ta = 0, the torsion Eq.(10) is in involution. This lets us ﬁrst solve the structure equations on a
submanifold and results in a substantial restriction of the connection forms. Extending back to the full
space, we then work through the full structure equations to determine the ﬁnal form of each connection
form.
4.1
The involution
The involution of the solder form,
dea = eb ∧ωa
b + ω ∧ea
18

allows us to apply the Frobenius theorem, which tells us that there exist n functions on the manifold, xµ,
such that
ea = e
a
µ dxµ
Furthermore, holding those functions constant, xµ = xµ
0, so that dxµ = 0 and ea = 0, the remaining structure
equations describe submanifolds of a foliation of the full space. These remaining equations are
d˜ωa
b
=
˜ωc
b ∧˜ωa
c + ˜Ω
a
b
d˜fa
=
˜ωb
a ∧˜fb + ˜fa ∧˜ω + ˜Sa
d˜ω
=
˜Ω
(47)
where the tilde indicates the restriction to vanishing solder form, e.g.,
˜ωa
b ≡ωa
b|xµ=xµ
0
We will also examine the restriction of the integrability (i.e., the Bianchi identity) of the co-solder equation,
0
=
d2˜fa
=
˜Ω
a
b ∧˜fb −˜ωb
a ∧˜Sb + ˜Sa ∧˜ω −˜fa ∧˜Ω+ d˜Sa
˜D˜Sa
=
˜fa ∧˜Ω−˜Ω
a
b ∧˜fb
(48)
When ea = 0, the curvature, co-torsion, and dilatation simplify to ˜Ω
a
b = 1
2Ωa
cd
b
˜fc∧˜fd, ˜Sa = 1
2S cd
a
˜fc∧˜fd,
and ˜Ω= 1
2Ωcd˜fc∧˜fd. In the previous section we showed that these components of the curvature and dilatation,
Ωa
cd
b
and Ωcd, vanish. Therefore, the structure equations and basis integrability reduce to
d˜ωa

d˜fa
=
˜ωb
a ∧˜fb + ˜fa ∧˜ω + 1
2S cd
a
˜fc ∧˜fd
˜D˜Sa
=

Let this submanifold be spanned by coordinates yµ. The ﬁrst two equations show that the spin connection,
˜ωa
b, and Weyl vector, ˜ω, are pure gauge on the submanifold,
˜ωa
b (x0, y)
=
−¯F a
c (xµ
0, yν) dF c
b (xµ
0, yν)
˜ω (x0, y)
=
df (xµ
0, yν)
where at each xµ
0 we are free to choose a local SO (p, q) transformation Λa
c (y) and a local dilatation φ (y).
This allows us to gauge both ˜ωa
b (x0, y) and ˜ω (x0, y) to zero if desired. It proves convenient to rename
the restriction of the basis, ha ≡˜fa and the restriction of the spin connection as ξa
b ≡˜ωa
b (x0, y), while
gauging the Weyl vector to zero. The basis ha must span the co-tangent space to the submanifold, so it
must be nondegenerate. The submanifold is then described by
dξa

(51)
To continue, we examine a manifold with these conditions, Eqs.(49-51). Notice that Eqs.(49)-(51) describe
a diﬀerentiable manifold with ﬂat connection for which the momentum part of the co-torsion 1
2S cd
a
hc ∧hd
is the torsion of the submanifold. This submanifold torsion is constrained by Eq.(45),
(1 + χ) S
bc
a
= 0
(52)
The importance of these properties will be seen in this and the following Sections.

4.2
Foliation by a Lie group
We quote a well-known theorem due to Auslander and Markus [49]:
THEOREM 5. Let M be a diﬀerentiable manifold with complete, ﬂat, aﬃne connection Γ and
holonomy group H(M; Γ) = 0. Then M is a complete Riemann space with Christoﬀel connection
Γ and M is diferentiably isometric with a torus space.
F. W. Kamber and Ph. Tondeur generalize this theorem [50], introducing their proof with the following:
Consider a linear connection on a smooth manifold. The connection is ﬂat, if the curvature
tensor R is zero. If the torsion tensor T has vanishing covariant derivative, the torsion is said
to be parallel. A linear connection is complete, if every geodesic can be deﬁned for any real
value of the aﬃne parameter. In this note the following structure theorem for smooth manifolds
admitting a complete ﬂat connection with parallel torsion is proved: Any such manifold is the
orbit space of a simply connected Lie group G under a properly discontinuous and ﬁxed-point free
action of a subgroup of the aﬃne group of G. This Theorem includes the classical cases of ﬂat
Riemannian manifolds and ﬂat aﬃne manifolds (Auslander and Markus), where the torsion is
assumed to be zero and G turns out to be Rn, and also generalizes a theorem of Hicks [Theorem
6] for complete connections with trivial holonomy group and parallel torsion tensor, stating that
a manifold with such a connection is homogeneous. We consider the case where the curvature
vanishes, without requiring the holonomy group to be trivial.
As noted above, our equations, Eqs.(49-51), exactly describe a manifold with ﬂat connection ξa
b but with
torsion satisfying only D˜Sa = 0.
This torsion conditions is weaker than those of the theorems above.
Moreover, the additional conditions may or may not hold.
Spacetime, and the more general SO (p, q)
spaces we consider may be pseudo-Riemannian rather than Riemannian. Further, we know that spacetimes
are generically incomplete [46, 47, 48] and that our physical spacetime contains black hole singularities
and initial time incompleteness; the corresponding properties of the momentum subspace depend on the
manifold chosen during the quotient construction. Finally, with our general considerations we cannot be
certain of the remaining speciﬁcations regarding holonomy present in both theorems. Therefore, we do not
attempt to apply Auslander-Markus or Kamber-Tondeur theorems, but derive our results directly, making
our assumptions explicit.
We consider the two possible solutions to Eq.(52):
Case 1: S
bc
a
= 0. In Sec.(6) below, we show that with no further assumptions, generic biconformal spaces
(i.e., those with χ ̸= −1) are foliated by an abelian Lie group. They therefore describe either the
co-tangent bundle or torus space foliations over SO (p, q) spaces. Generically, therefore, the conclusion
of Theorem 5 of Auslander and Markus holds for the momentum submanifolds of biconformal space.
Case 2: χ = −1. In Sec.(7) below, we show that the subclass of biconformal spaces with 1+χ = 0 allows the
possibility of foliation by a nonabelian Lie group. The result is consistent with the claim of Kamber
and Tondeur. To make further progress, we too assume vanishing covariant derivative of the torsion
rather than vanishing covariant exterior derivative.
In the remainder of this Section and in Sec.(5), we show results that hold for either Case 1 or Case 2 by
assuming S
bc
a
constant and placing no condition on χ. This is suﬃcient to show foliation by a Lie group; we
leave detailed topological discussion to subsequent studies. In Sec.(5) we extend back to the full biconformal
space, substituting the form of the connection into the structure equations to continue the reduction of the
system toward general relativity. The program is completed in two diﬀerent ways for Case 1 and Case 2, in
Sections (6) and (7) respectively.
4.2.1
Co-torsion Bianchi
We have seen that the vanishing torsion, Ta = 0, combined with the dilatation Bianchi identity gives
Eqs.(52). For the remainder of this Section, we will place a weaker constraint on the momentum co-torsion
20

and χ consistent with both Cases above. Thus, the conclusions of this Section for the discussions of both
Sec.(6) and Sec.(7).
The integrability condition for the submanifold co-torsion, Eq.(51) is
0
=
˜D˜Sa
=
1
2S [αβ;µ]
a
dyα ∧dyβ ∧dyµ
(53)
so the covariant exterior y-derivative of 1
2S cd
a
hc ∧hd vanishes. Choosing the yα-dependent part of the gauge
so that the submanifold spin connection and Weyl vector vanish, the covariant derivative reduces to a partial
derivative,
0
=
˜d˜Sa
and therefore for some 1-form, ξa
˜Sa
=
˜
dξa
In coordinate components,
S αβ
a
= ξ α,β
a
−ξ β,α
a
However, instead of such a general potential ˜ξa, we assume
∂µS
αβ
a
=
0
(54)
This is one of the assumptions of the Kamber-Tondeur Theorem.
With the momentum co-torsion independent of yµ the structure equation on the ea = 0 submanifolds
becomes
dha = 1
2S cd
a
(x0) hc ∧hd
(55)
In terms of the basis ha the integrability condition for eq.(55) is
0
≡

(x0) hc ∧hd
=
S cd
a

2S cd

(x0) S ef
c
(x0) he ∧hf ∧hd
and therefore,
S c[d

S ef]
c
= 0
With S bc
a

2c bc

(56)
c c[d

(57)
form the Maurer-Cartan equations and the Jacobi identity (in the adjoint representation) for an n-dimensional
Lie algebra. The ﬁeld equation for the momentum co-torsion, Eq.(37) shows that the adjoint generators are
traceless, so when the adjoint representation is faithful the Lie group elements will have unit determinant.
With the observation that ha has an n-dimensional SO (p, q) or Spin (p, q) index (depending on which
representation we have chosen for the beginning group), we have therefore proved the following theorem:
Theorem: In any 2n-dimensional, torsion-free biconformal spaces with ∂µS
αβ
a
= 0, there exists an n-
dimensional foliation by a Lie group. If the adjoint representation is faithful, the group is special.
21

We conjecture that the theorem holds for all torsion free biconformal spaces.
This is one of our most important new results, giving a deﬁnitive interpretation to the doubled dimension
of biconformal spaces.
Introducing vector ﬁelds Ga dual to the one forms ha, we have

Let G be the Lie group generated by the Ga. Then the y-submanifold at each x0 is the group manifold.
Since ha transforms as a vector under SO (p, q), there may be constraints between SO (p, q) and G.
Acting with Λa

so the structure constants must transform as a

tensor, consistent with Sa being a tensor. Since
SO (p, q) acts on itself, any subgroup of SO (p, q) will be allowed, but it is clear that there are additional
possibilities. For example, the vanishing structure constants of an abelian group will be preserved, as will
partly abelian combinations. We develop a concrete example.
Starting with a 3-dim representation of SO (3), we require a 3-dimensional Lie group with structure
constants that transform as a tensor under SO (3). Consider ISO (2), the two translations and one rotation
of the plane. The Lie algebra is
[R, T1]
=
−2T2
[R, T2]
=
2T1
where we may think of R as the generator of rotations about the z-axis and Tk as translations in the xy-plane.
The nonvanishing structure constants (using the conventional index positions) are then c1
32
=
c1
13 =
−c1
23
=
−c2
31
=
2.
While this 3-dim picture of the group is clearly rotationally invariant, we may make the proof explicit by
deﬁning three unit vectors
ni
(a)
≡
δi
a
Letting the generators in an arbitrary basis form a 3-vector G = (G1, G2, G3) we set
R
=
n(3) · G
T1
=
n(1) · G
T2
=
n(2) · G
22

Then the structure constants may be written in terms of the unit vectors as

−2ni
(2)
 n(3)jn(1)k −n(1)jn(3)k

which now manifestly transforms as a
 1
2

tensor under rotations.
For n = 4, the electroweak group, SU (2) × U (1), naturally springs to mind. This, and other particular
cases will be explored explicitly in subsequent work.
Now consider the eﬀect on S bc
a
of allowing xµ to vary. At each value of xµ, S cd
a
(x), comprises the
structure constants of a Lie group. However, while the structure constants depend on the choice of the basis
of group generator, we are limited to diﬀerentiable changes. Since Lie algebras are classiﬁed by a discrete set
of possible root diagrams, a continuous transformation as we vary xµ cannot change to structure constants
with a diﬀerent root diagram. Moreover, by choosing the basis of dual 1-forms appropriately at each point,
we may bring the structure constants to a given standard form c
bc
a
. With S bc
a
(x) = −c
bc
a
at each value
of xµ, there is no x-dependence. With any such choice of basis, dS
bc
a
= 0, and we may set
S
bc
a
(x, y)
=
−c
bc
a
across the entire biconformal manifold.
If the group G is abelian, the structure constants are zero and the momentum co-torsion vanishes. In
this case, dha = 0 and we have
ha = f µ
a
(x) dyµ
where the y-dependence of the coeﬃcients must now vanish, though in this case it is useful to allow the
dependence on xµ. This describes an exact, orthonormal frame and therefore a ﬂat space. Since we evaluate
at ﬁxed xα = xα
0 , the coeﬃcients f µ
a
(x0) are constants on the submanifold, but may be functions of xµ when
we extend back to the full biconformal space. This is equivalent to the abelian Lie algebra of n translations,
and the G-foliation of the biconformal space may be identiﬁed as the co-tangent bundle of the remaining
SO (p, q) space. Alternatively, the abelian group may be taken as a compactiﬁcation on a torus.
4.2.2
Parameterization of the group elements as coordinates
The integral of the structure equations,
dha
=
−1
2c bc
a hb ∧hc
S c[d
a
S ef]
c
=
0
gives the group manifold, which is most easily coordinatized by the group elements. We may ﬁnd these by
exponentiating the Lie algebra, V = {yaGa|ya ∈Rn} where Ga satisfy the Lie algebra relations in Eqs.(58)
and (59). The group elements may be parameterized by coordinates ya, by exponentiating the Lie algebra,
g (y) = eyaGa ∈G.
The basis forms, ha may be explicitly turned into Lie algebra valued one forms using any desired linear
representation of the generators, ξC
B ≡−ha [Ga] C
B .
For example, using the adjoint representation we
contract a copy of the structure constants with the Maurer-Cartan equations, eq.(56), and deﬁne ξc
b ≡
−ha [Ga] c

5
Returning to the full space
We have established a geometric breakdown of the 2n-dim biconformal space into an n-dimensional foliation
with a Lie group for leaves. However, the connection forms still retain their dependence on the full set of
coordinates (xα, yβ). In this Section, and for the generic χ ̸= −1 case in the next Section, we show that the
structure equations further restrict this dependence so that except for certain explicit linear yα dependence,
all ﬁelds depend only on the xα, up to coordinate choices and gauge transformations. To this end, we turn
to the full space and the Cartan structure equations.
When we restore the solder form, letting xµ vary again, the connection forms must be given by their
ea = 0 parts, Eqs.(49, 56, and the vanishing Weyl vector) plus additional parts proportional to the solder
form. Therefore,
ωa

(62)
ω

(63)
Eqs. (60) - (63) hold as long as we perform only x-dependent ﬁber transformations. While this form is
convenient for recognizing the content of the geometry, the biconformal space is unchanged by more general
transformations. General (xα, yβ)-dependent transformations on biconformal space act similarly to canonical
transformations on phase spaces. They do not change the underlying physics.
We substitute these forms into the structure equations, with the reduced curvatures as given in Eq.(46),

5.1
The basis structure equations
First consider the solder form equation, Eq.(65). Substituting Eqs.(60), (61) and (63) for the current form
of the connection,
dxµ ∧∂µea + dyµ ∧∂µea
=
ωa
bceb ∧ec + Wbeb ∧ea
The sole mixed term must vanish, dyµ ∧∂µea = 0, and this requires the solder form to be independent of
yα. Therefore,
e a
µ (x, y) = e a
µ (x)
(68)
5.1.1
Solving the solder form equation for the spin connection
The next step is to solve the solder form equation for the spin connection. In the remaining ea∧eb part of the
reduced solder form equation, Eq.(61) we may separate the connection into the familiar metric compatible
piece, and a Weyl vector piece. Let αa
b be chosen as the ea-compatible connection, so that
dea = eb ∧αa
b
(69)
We note that as a consequence of Eqs.(68) and (69), αa
b = αa
b (x). Then writing ωa
b = αa
b + βa
b with
antisymmetry on each piece, αa
b = −ηacηbdαd

Since the solution is unique up to local Weyl transformations, we need only ﬁnd an expression that works.

b is the connection compatible with ea. Any y-dependence must come from the Weyl vector.

third, we recover the explicit form of the compatible connection of a Weyl geometry [39]:

Curvature equation
We next study the curvature equation, Eq.(64). We begin with its integrability condition, which places
strong constraints on the co-torsion. Then, substituting the connection forms from Eqs.(60)-(62), we impose
the curvature ﬁeld equation, Ωc
acb = 0.

To ﬁnd the independent parts, we must break the exterior derivative into d(x) and d(y). This also requires
separating the independent parts of the co-solder form,

The curvature structure equation
We next ﬁnd the components of the curvature, Ωa

equation.
Substituting Eq.(62) for fa and expanding the exterior derivatve dωa
b = d(x)ωa

The ad trace of Eq.(82) requires

which solves the full cross-term equation. This same condition is also required by the dilatation equation
below. For the eced terms, notice that we may still have some yµ dependence.

In any dimension greater than two, knowing the Schouten tensor is equivalent to knowing the Ricci tensor,
since we may always invert, Rab = (n −2) Rab + ηabR. In terms of the Schouten tensor, the decomposition
of the Riemann curvature into the traceless Weyl conformal tensor, Ca
b and its Ricci parts, takes the simple
form [39],
Ra

(86)
Using this decomposition, the Ricci parts of the curvature combine with the additional terms from the

bcd = 0, this has the component form, for any Pab, 0 = ∆ce
dbPec −∆ce
cbPed, which, expanding the
projections and combining result with the further contraction with ηbd, is seen to be true if and only if
Pab = 0.
Applying this general result to the ﬁeld equation by replacing Pec, we have
Rec + D(α,x)
c
We + WeWc −1
2ηecW 2 + (1 + χ) cec = 0
(88)
This determines cab unless 1 + χ = 0. The symmetric part of the ﬁrst four terms on the left side is the
Weyl-Schouten tensor,
Ra ≡Ra +

W(a;b) + WaWb −1

R[bd]

This agrees with the trace of the corresponding term of the torsion-free Bianchi identity arising from Eq.(65),
and shows that cab may have both symmetric and antisymmetric parts.
Returning to the full spacetime curvature after satisfying the ﬁeld equation,
Ωa
bcd

bcd (α)
(89)

so the spacetime piece of the biconformal curvature reduces to the Weyl (conformal) curvature of the metric
compatible connection. This part of the curvature is independent of yµ as required by Eq.(80), since the only
yµ-dependence of the connection must arise from the Weyl vector, and as seen in Eq.(87) the Weyl vector is
only present in the trace terms of the curvature. The full SO (p, q) curvature may now be written as

Theorem: In any torsion-free biconformal space with integrable Weyl vector, Wα = ∂αφ, and 1 + χ ̸= 0,
the spacetime co-torsion is the obstruction to conformal Ricci ﬂatness.

5.3
The dilatation and co-torsion structure equations
Expanding the dilatation equation, Eq.(67), using Eqs.(61)-(63), to display the independent parts
d(x)ω + d(y)ω
=
(1 + χ) ec ∧hc + (1 + χ) ec ∧cc
we ﬁnd two independent equations,
d(x)ω
=
(1 + χ) c
(92)
d(y)ω
=
(1 + χ) ec ∧hc
(93)
where we have set c ≡ec ∧cc.
The Bianchi identity reduces to 0 ≡d2ω = (1 + χ) d (ea ∧fa) =
(1 + χ) D (ea ∧fa) = −(1 + χ) ea ∧Sa, which reproduces Eqs.(78) and (79) and shows that
(1 + χ) S[abc]
=

The dilatation structure equations may be integrated exactly, but the result depends crucially on whether
or not (1 + χ) = 0. The two cases will be handled separately in the next two Sections.
The co-torsion structure equation also depends on the case considered. In addition to the structure
equations (66), we still have the ﬁeld equations

To complete the reduction of the biconformal space, we turn to the 1 + χ ̸= 0 and 1 + χ = 0 cases.
6
Generic case: 1 + χ ̸= 0
In this Section, we consider the ﬁnal reduction to spacetime for generic values of the constants α, β, γ in the
original action, assuming
1 + χ ̸= 0
(96)
It follows that we must have S bc
a
= 0 and therefore on the ea = 0 submanifold,
d(y)ha
=
0
ha
=
d(y)ya
where the functions ya may be written as coordinates with an x0-dependent linear transformation,
ha (xµ
0, yµ) = h
µ
a
(xµ
0) (yµ + βµ (xµ
0))
When we return to the full biconformal space, the linear coeﬃcients h
µ
a
(x) and βµ (x) remain as arbitrary
coordinate choices. The full co-solder form, Eq.(62), then satisﬁes
fa
=
h µ
a (x) dyµ + cab (x, y) eb
=
h µ
a (x) dyµ + h µ
a (x) dβµ (x) + cab (x, y) eb
31

Thus, the coordinate choice of the origin for yµ at each xα changes cab. We continue to deﬁne the co-basis
ha as only the dyµ part,
ha
≡
h µ
a (x) dyµ
(97)
The momentum space is therefore foliated by abelian group manifolds. The foliation may be identiﬁed as Rn
or a toroidal compactiﬁcation of all or part of Rn. Being principally interested in the underlying presence
of general relativity, we take it to be Rn and eventually identify it with the cotangent space at each xα.
However, it may also be taken as the torus T d of double ﬁeld theory for other applications to string theory.
Given the form Eq.(97) of the co-basis ha, it is useful to begin with the natural inner product arising from
the conformal Killing form together with our freedom to choose the x-coordinates. The coordinate freedom
allows us to conveniently choose the functions h a
µ to be the inverse solder form, enabling us to integrate the
dilatation equation for the Weyl vector.
6.1
The Killing metric
The ﬁeld h µ
a (x) lets us choose a convenient orthonormal basis for the yα space at each point of the xα
space. Taking the restriction of the conformal Killing form to the biconformal manifold,
 0
δa
b
δd
d


, as the
biconformal metric lets us usefully control this coordinate freedom. The Killing metric gives the orthonormal
inner product of (ea, fb) basis,

ea, eb
=
0
⟨ea, fb⟩
=
δa
b
⟨fa, fb⟩
=
0
Choosing arbitrary coordinates, ˜xµ as the complement to yµ, the ﬁrst of these three relations,

ea, eb
= 0,
shows that ⟨d˜xµ, d˜xν⟩= 0. Substituting fa = ha + cabeb into ⟨ea, fb⟩and expanding in coordinates,
δa
b
=
⟨ea, hb + cbcec⟩
=
⟨ea, hb⟩

h µ
b
(˜x) e a
ν (˜x) ⟨d˜xν, dyµ⟩
e ν
b (˜x)
=
h µ
b
(˜x) ⟨d˜xν, dyµ⟩
(98)
Using ⟨ea, hb⟩= δa
b in the ⟨fa, fb⟩inner product, we ﬁnd ⟨ha, hb⟩,
0
=
⟨fa, fb⟩
=

ha + cacec, hb + cbded
⟨ha, hb⟩
=
−(cab + cba) = −2c(ab)
(99)
We see from Eq.(98) that the inner product of dyµ with d˜xν cannot depend on yµ,
⟨d˜xν, dyµ⟩= kν
µ (˜x)
Moreover, like e ν
b (˜x) and h µ
b
(˜x), kν
µ (˜x) must be invertible. Let xα = xα (˜x) be any coordinate transfor-
mation of ˜xα. Then in the new x-coordinates the inner product becomes
⟨dxα, dyµ⟩
=
 ∂xν
∂˜xα d˜xα, dyµ

=
∂xν
∂˜xα kα
µ (˜x)
32

Since ∂xν
∂˜xα is an arbitrary general linear transformation at each point and kν
µ is invertible, we may choose
∂xν
∂˜xα to be its inverse. Then
⟨dxν, dyµ⟩= δν
µ
Writing eq.(98) in these new coordinates, we have
h µ
b
(x) = e µ
b
(x)
showing that in these coordinates h µ
b
(x) is just the inverse matrix to e a
µ (x). This ﬁxes
ha = e µ
b
(x) dyµ
(100)
6.2
The dilatation equation
With the change of x-coordinate, the basis forms are now given by
ea
=
e a
µ (x) dxµ
(101)
fa
=
e α
a (dyα + dβα + cανdxν)
(102)

Eq.(104) is integrated immediately,

Before making the obvious coordinate choice, βµ = −αµ, it is suggestive to comment on the form
of Eq.(105). The integration “constant” αµ (x) is a potential for the antisymmetric part of cµν and the
antisymmetric part is independent of yµ. Since an x-dependent rescaling does not aﬀect the vanishing of
the fa component of the Weyl vector, we may perform a dilatation to modify αµ (x). This is precisely the
form of the gauge transformation of the electromagnetic potential, but as with the failed Weyl theory of
electromagnetism, it may lead to unphysical size changes since the dilatational curvature, Ωµν does not
necessarily vanish.
However, notice that biconformal space has a symplectic form.
Eq.(67) describes a
manifestly nondegenerate 2-form, ea ∧fa, which is exact and therefore closed. This means we may interpret
the full biconformal space as a relativistic particle phase space with canonical coordinates (xα, yβ).
In
this view, yµ is a momentum and the Weyl vector (105) has exactly the form and gauge properties of the
electromagnetic conjugate momentum if αµ is taken proportional to the vector potential. Moreover, the
previous well-known conﬂict with observation is avoided. The transformation by βµ to remove αµ is then
the cannonical transformation between the conjugate electromagnetic momentum, πµ = pµ −eAµ and the
simple particle momentum pµ.
The original ill-fated attempt by Weyl to identify the Weyl vector of a Weyl geometry as the vector
potential of electromagnetism, Wµ = eAµ, leads to nonvanishing dilatation in the presence of electromagnetic
33

ﬁelds, Ωµν = eFµν. Einstein immediately observed that this conﬂicts with experiment, and it is easy to show,
for example, that two hydrogen atoms moving to produce a closed path that encloses some electromagnetic
ﬂux would emerge with diﬀerent sizes, and therefore very diﬀerent spectra. The precision of atomic spectra
therefore disproves the simplest version of the theory. The situation is completely diﬀerent in the biconformal
setting. Because of the extra eafa term in the dilatation equation, it is possible to have vanishing dilatational
curvature and retain the interpretation of αµ (rather than Wµ) as the vector potential. The idea has been
explored to some extent in [9]. Here, the form of the dilatation is given by
Ω
=
Ωa
bfa ∧ea
=
χea ∧fa
=
χδµ
ν e ν
a e a
µ dxµ ∧dyν + χcµνe a
µ dxµ ∧dxν
or since we may also write Ω= 1
2Ωµνdxµdxν + Ωµ
νdyµdxν + Ωµνdyµdyν we have coordinate components
Ωµν
=
χ (cµν −cνµ)
Ωµ
ν
=
−χδµ
ν
Ωµν
=
0
Therefore, while the space spanned by fa = 0 shows no unphysical size changes, Ωab = 0, the space deﬁned
by setting yµ = 0 has Ωµν given by the antisymmetric part of cµν.
It is possible to avoid dilatational curvature altogether by setting χ = 0. In this case, the full dilatational
curvature is identically zero. There is still a symplectic form in this subclass of theories, since we still have
dω = ea ∧fa. This permits the consistent interpretation of the Weyl vector as the conjugate electromagnetic
momentum according to Eq.(105).
Notice that setting χ = 0 is inconsistent with the 1 + χ = 0 cases to be studied in the next Section.
The possibility of a geometric graviweak theory with 1 + χ = 0 is more appealing than this χ = 0 case,
since the success of the standard model strongly suggests that the electromagnetic and weak interactions
should arise together. We continue with the generic picture, but eventually choose the ya coordinate to be
oﬀset by βµ (x) = −αµ (x). This makes Ωµν = χc[µν] vanish without restricting the action, while it leaves
the cross-dilatation nonzero and cµν symmetric. There is no eﬀect of this on spacetime, but, identifying
yµ =
i
ℏpµ as argued in [41, 42] it leads to a non-integrability in phase space of the form
i
ℏ
¸
pµdxµ ̸= 0
arising from the interesting conjunction of the dilatational curvature with the symplectic form. The result
might be consistent with a quantum interpretation. This idea has been explored in [42, 41, 30].
Without further conjecture on the interpretation of the geometry, we continue with the generic case
of the reduction toward general relativity. Without loss of generality, we choose the yµ coordinate so that
αµ = ˜α (x)+βµ (x) = 0, but this is merely a convenient coordinate choice. The solution retains full coordinate
covariance.
Collecting the forms for the connection and basis established in Eqs.(71) and (101), and writing the

this is the case, but only at constant yα.

This is in agreement with our conclusion, Eq.(91), from the spacetime Bianchi equation combined with the
usual Riemannian Bianchi identity. The result means that for vanishing co-torsion and constant yα there
exists an x-dependent gauge transformation to a Ricci ﬂat spacetime.
This form is not unfamiliar, the
same expression having been noted in another context in [17]. The remaining y-dependence is the only
obstruction to the Triviality Theorem: if a conformal transformation could make Sabc vanish for all yα, then
the biconformal space would necessarily be trivial.
Note that the ﬁeld equations Eqs.(94) and the Bianchi identities Eqs.(95) for the co-torsion are now all
satisﬁed for any allowed Sa.

This is exactly the condition for the existence of a conformal transformation to a spacetime satisfying the

The ha = 0 submanifold is therefore a spacetime satisfying the locally scale-covariant Einstein equation,
including phenomenological matter sources. Study is underway to determine whether the energy-momentum
of fundamental source ﬁelds automatically enter in this way in place of cab, or if special couplings to matter
are required in the Lagrangian. Notice that in the Riemannian gauge Eq.(122) reduces to
WbRb

For a single vector to annihilate the curvature tensor can happen only in the simplest Petrov type spacetimes
(O and N, and these are already conformally Ricci ﬂat; see [17]) and we conclude that, generically, the gauge
transformation that makes the spacetime Riemannian is simultaneously the one which makes the Weyl vector
vanish.

6.5.3
Metric on the Lagrangian submanifold
While we have used the Killing form to motivate the choice of h
µ
a
(x) in the basis form on the cotangent
spaces, Eq.(100), the use of the Killing form is not necessary. Indeed, when general relativity is developed
as a gauge theory from the Poincaré group, the Killing form vanishes when restricted to the base manifold.
Instead, the spacetime metric may be motivated by the spin connection, which is compatible with Lorentzian
signature. Ultimately, there is no inherent group structure that requires the choice except this compatibility.
Similarly, in the biconformal gauging, we may introduce an SO (p, q) compatible metric by hand on the
Lagrangian submanifolds where the restriction of the Killing form vanishes. For Lorentzian cases, with an
original SO (n −1, 1) spin connection, it is natural to introduce the corresponding Minkowski metric on each
Lagrangian submanifold.
This choice is suﬃcient for the generic case, but since the restriction of the conformal killing form to
biconformal space is non-degenerate, there are alternatives that trace their origin to the conformal group.
These have been explored in a variety of ways ([41, 31, 22, 44, 32]) but these considerations take us too far
beyond the scope of this class of solutions.

Non-abelian case: 1 + χ = 0
We note that the condition 1 + χ = 0 becomes, in terms of the parameters of the original action,
0

nγ −((n −1) α −β)
39

and this does not coincide with any other special conditions.
We now return to the form of the connection, structure equations, and curvatures established at the end

Here we see the realization of one of the motivations for the use of the conformal group as the starting
point for Poincaré gravity, and the subsequent motivation for the biconformal gauging. One anticipates
that by starting with the larger conformal group and taking the quotient by the inhomogeneous Weyl group
40

C/IW that the resulting additional symmetry might account for some known or new fundamental interaction
beyond gravity. This hope is frustrated by the ﬁnding that the additional special conformal gauge ﬁelds fa are
always auxiliary, and determined by the Ricci tensor [43]. When these auxiliary gauge ﬁelds are substituted
back into the rest of the model, they serve to turn the Riemann curvature tensor into the Weyl curvature
tensor. As a result, though they enforce conformal symmetry, they never provide an additional interaction.
As a way to avoid the elimination of fa, we are led to the biconformal gauging, C/W, the idea being that
if both ea and fb together are required to span the base manifold, then fb cannot possibly be removed as
auxiliary [8, 9]. Although considerable subsequent work continues to ﬁnd fa serving to turn Ra
b to Ca
b as
in subsection (5.2.3), the emergence of an additional symmetry group is now realized in the 1 + χ subclass
of cases.
The biconformal space comes equipped with the SO (p, q) pseudo-rotation group of an n-dimensional
space, but these rotations and boosts acts on a 2n-dimensional manifold. This is much less than the SO (n, n)
one might expect. Indeed, as seen above, the generic torsion-free solution dictates that half the space is ﬂat,
so there is no curvature corresponding to the dyµ part of the spin connection. The spin connection reduces,
essentially, to the metric compatible connection of ea,

which is fully expressed on the n-dimensional, constant yµ Lagrangian submanifolds. This reduction of the
spin connection reduces the number of physical ﬁelds, but when 1+χ = 0 the extra translational gauge ﬁelds
– the co-solder form – make up for it by providing a new connection and ﬁeld strength: there is necessarily
an n-dimensional Lie group G acting at each xµ. Since the n-dimensions of this group are labeled by an
SO (p, q) index, SO (p, q) must act on G. We show in this section that this internal symmetry group is
gauged.
For a particularly pertinent example, suppose we have started with Euclidean 4-space. This does not
preclude a spacetime Lagrangian submanifold, for it has been shown in [31] that time emerges uniquely from a
Euclidean starting point, while [22] shows that this emergence arises purely from properties of the conformal
group. With the 4-dim Euclidean starting point, the spin connection has symmetry SO (4) = SU (2)×SU (2).
The obvious 4-dimensional subgroup is the electroweak symmetry, SU (2)×U (1). In this case, the symmetry
breaking from a left-right symmetric electroweak theory to left-handed representations of SU (2) is forced
by the requirement of an n-dimensional subgroup. In a spinor representation of the conformal group, the Pa
and Ka (xµ and yµ submanifolds) are left- and right-handed, respectively. Details of this case are currently
under investigation.
It is important to note that although this symmetry G is restricted to be acted on by SO (p, q) the con-
nection gauge ﬁeld, structure constants and ﬁeld strength arise completely independently. The biconformal
gauging has the additional ﬁelds required for this further symmetry.
While a ﬁber bundle gives us a foliation, the converse is not always the case. The central requirment
to have a principal ﬁber bundle is the existence of a projection from the bundle to the base manifold. We
establish this by showing a second involution. Separating the co-solder equation into independent parts,
d(x)ca
=
αb

we observe that the exterior yα-derivative of ca must be linear in dyα, and so linear in ha. We may therefore
write d(y)ca = C

a hb ∧ea and solve for dha on the full biconformal space,
dha = d(x)ha + d(y)ha
=
αb
a ∧hb + S c
a
dhc ∧ed −c cd

This shows that ha is in involution. Setting ha = 0 constitutes a projection to an n-dimensional submanifold
spanned by ea.

7.1
Gauging G
We compare our usual gauging of G with the structures already present in the biconformal geometry.
Our usual gauging of a symmetry is to take the Cartan generalization of the Maurer-Cartan equation
for G, eq.(126). For this we replace the Maurer-Cartan connection ha with a general connection, leading to
the introduction of a ﬁeld strength. Taking Aa to be the generalization of ha, the Maurer-Cartan equation
becomes the Cartan equation,
dAa = −1
2c cd
a
Ac ∧Ad + Fa
(127)
where the ﬁeld strength Fa is required to be horizontal and the equation integrable. Horizontality demands
Fa
=

2Facdec ∧ed
(128)
while integrability requires
0
≡
d2Aa

Ac ∧dAd + dFa
=

2c [ef

a
Ac ∧Ae ∧Af + c cd
a
Ac ∧Fd + dFa

D(G)Fa
since c [ef

= 0 by the Jacobi identity for G.
Within the biconformal solution, we interpret the co-solder forms fa as these generalized potentials Aa
for the G-connection. The full structure equation for fa, however, is not exactly what we expect for a typical
gauging. Instead we have
dfa = ωb
a ∧fb + fa ∧ω + 1
2Sacdec ∧ed + S c
a
dfc ∧ed −1
2c cd

fc ∧fd
The situation appears to be similar to what Kibble encountered in writing general relativity as a gauge theory
of the Poincaré group [2]. Kibble introduced Poincaré ﬁbers over spacetime, then “soldered” the translational
gauge ﬁelds of the ﬁber symmetry to the cotangent basis of the bundle. This identiﬁcation avoided double
counting the translations.
With the quotient method, such identiﬁcation is no longer needed since the
quotient of the Poincaré group by the Lorentz group automatically changes the translational symmetry into
the base manifold.
Here, we already have an SO (p, q) symmetry on the ﬁbers and ﬁnd that the base manifold has a similar,
but restricted symmetry. It is this latter, emergent symmetry we would like to use. The present situation
diﬀers from the Poincaré case since it is the connection and not the frame ﬁeld that is doubled, with ωd

∧fd both acting on the same index of fd. We cannot simply solder the two together because
they produce covariance with respect to diﬀerent symmetries. Moreover, we still need the original symmetry
to act on the remaining gauge ﬁelds in the usual way. There are a number of possible resolutions to the
diﬃculty. First, it might be possible to build the gauging of the co-solder form into the original quotient.
However, though closer examination may reveal a natural way to do this, it would seem to lose the appealing
feature of an emergent internal symmetry. A second approach is suggested by [22, 23, 44], in which an
initially SO (n) connection is written as a Lorentz connection plus additional terms, which then introduce
physical ﬁelds. If a similar technique is applied here, perhaps along with the transformation of [22], it is
possible that the restriction of the connection can occur directly.
A third approach is to keep both connections but keep careful track of which ﬁelds transform under which
symmetry. This actually causes no problem for additional ﬁelds we might wish to introduce, since these will
enter as representations of either the SO (p, q) transformations, the G transformations, or both, leaving no
ambiguity about their transformations. The only potential conﬂict arises with fa ⇔fA itself. Thinking
of G as a subgroup of SO (p, q), we must wonder whether a full SO (p, q) transformation would introduce
sensible but distinct copies of the gauge potential. In the case of electroweak symmetry, we could construct
42

a theory with SO (4) breaking to SU (2) × U (1) on the ﬁbers while the full SO (4) is written following [22],
as a Lorentz connection plus additional scalar ﬁeld and cosmological constant. It is not clear whether the
resulting weak ﬁelds would violate the causal structure of the Lorentz sector.
However, these conjectures will require–and are the subject of–further study.
For the present we content ourselves with the following. First, we satisfy the ﬁnal ﬁeld equation for the
cross-term of the co-torsion,
∆ar
sb S

c
a = ∆ar
scS b
a

by the suﬃcient condition S

c
a = 0.
The only remaining ﬁeld equation is S
ba
a
= −c
ba
a
= 0, the
tracelessness of the structure constants. This leads to unit determinant for elements of G.
Having solved the ﬁeld equations, we identify fa as the gauge ﬁeld Aa, we modify the indices to make it
clear which gauge group applies. For ﬁelds that transform under SO (p, q), we retain the lower case Latin
indices, while for ﬁelds that transform under G we replace the relevant indices by upper case Latin. Both
sets range from 1 to n. The connection becomes a pair,

so in the new notation, αA
B = 0 and 1

fc = 0.
The curvature and solder form equations are unchanged, but the co-torsion equation becomes

or, since αB

This exactly reproduces the form of a Yang-Mills ﬁeld, Eqs.(127) and (128).

the internal symmetry G has fully decoupled from the spactime geometry.
7.1.1
Metric on the submanifolds in the nonabelian case
The nonabelian case still allows us to simply choose the spacetime metric as is done in general relativity
and was used in the generic case above. For the group submanifold, it is natural to choose the Killing form
of G if it is nondegenerate. While this assignment is certainly possible for semisimple G, the details depend
on the particular group and will be discussed elsewhere. As with the generic case, the considerations of
[41, 31, 22, 44, 32] may be relevant.
7.2
Remaining issues
While we have arrived at a satisfactory separation of a new internal symmetry, we still lack both the ﬁeld
equation for SA and the contribution of this additional ﬁeld to the Einstein equation. We consider three
possible resolutions:
43

1. The absence of a source for gravity arising from G is not surprising given the restriction of the action to
linear curvature terms. Including up to quadratic curvature terms in the original action could provide
both ﬁeld equation and gravitational coupling.
2. Allow nonvanishing cross-term to the torsion. This preserves the involution of the solder form and
avoids spacetime torsion. The cross-term gives extrinsic curvature to the embedding of the submanifolds
into the full biconformal space, and allows curvature of the group manifold as in [51]. The cross-term
of the torsion, driven by the internal symmetry, then enters the spacetime curvature quadratically and
might supply the required gravitational source.
3. The gravitational instanton has been shown to introduce both ﬁeld equations and gravitational source
in the usual form [52, 53].
Leaving these considerations to further work, we make only the following observation. It would be natural
to introduce a quadratic term such as
´
Ta ∧∗Sa into the action. With vanishing torsion, only the variation
δTa = Dδea yields nonvanishing contributions
δe
ˆ
Ta ∧∗Sa
=
ˆ
δea ∧D∗Sa + surface term + terms proportional to torsion
This term leads to a divergence of Sa in the curvature equation, but it because of the presence of fa in
the volume form also gives terms quadratic in the components of Sa. However, with vanishing co-torsion
cross-term the quadratic terms added to the spacetime curvature ﬁeld equations involve only products of the
spacetime and the momentum components,

and these are not in the form of energy momentum tensor. This suggests that a combination of this quadratic
term and nonvanishing cross-term for torsion may provide a solution.

Conclusions
We have shown how general relativity emerges from the torsion-free solutions to biconformal gravity. The
derivations involve ﬁeld equation driven dimensional reduction and may therefore have relevance to dimen-
sional reduction of twistor string, or the reduction of Drinfeld doubles.
8.1
Results in biconformal gravity
We began with the conformal group Cp,q of a compactiﬁed space with (p, q)-signature metric in n = p + q di-
mensions. The quotient of Cp,q by its homogeneous Weyl subgroup W gives a 2n-dimensional Kahler manifold
with local SO (p, q) and scale invariance. Generalizing this local structure leads to a curved geometry charac-
terized by SO (p, q) curvature, torsion, co-torsion and dilatational curvature corresponding to the generators
of the conformal group. Throughout, SO (p, q) may be replaced by Spin (p, q) when a spinor representation
is desired. This biconformal space admits a scale invariant action functional linear in the Cartan curvatures,
Eq.(1). Varying the action yields a gravity theory in 2n dimensions. All models with (n −2) α −2β nonzero
are considered. The special case when ((n −2) α −2β) = 0 may include non-integrable Weyl geometries
and, likely being unphysical, these are not considered in detail.
We established the following distinct results for this model.
1. Triviality with vanishing torsion and co-torsion. If, in addition to vanishing torsion, the co-
torsion (the ﬁeld strength of special conformal transformations) is taken to vanish, the biconformal
space takes a trivial form, with the only nonvanishing components of the SO (p, q) and dilatational
curvatures being constant cross-terms.
44

2. Foliation by a Lie subgroup. We prove that half of the biconformal space is foliated by an n-
dimensional Lie group G with structure constants lying in a representation of SO (p, q). This result
follows from the involution guaranteed by vanishing torsion, together with the ﬁeld equations. When
α, β and γ are chosen such that χ =
1
n−1

1 +
n2γ
(n−1)α−β

= −1, G may be non-abelian, otherwise it is
abelian.
3. Generic solution. The generic solution assumes only that 1 + χ is nonzero, together with vanishing
torsion, Ta = 0.
The ﬁeld equations reduce the only nontrivial dependence of all the remaining
curvatures – the SO(p, q) curvature, co-torsion, and dilatation – from 2n independent variables (xα, yβ)
down to n variables (xα) and reduce the number and form of the independent components. Explicitly,
the form and dependency of each curvature ΩA ∈{Ωa
b, Sa, Ω} begins as three distinct tensors
dependent on 2n coordinates,
ΩA = 1
2ΩA
cd (xα, yβ) ec ∧ed + ΩAc
d (xα, yβ) fc ∧ed + 1
2ΩAcd (xα, yβ) fc ∧fd
and after application of the ﬁeld equations, each is reduced as follows:

and the manifest involution of ha = e α

submanifold for spacetime. Conversely, setting xα = constant gives conjugate Lagrangian sub-
manifolds, each the leaf of a foliation by ﬂat manifolds. The entire 2n-dimensional biconformal
spaces is therefore interpreted as the cotangent bundle of spacetime. The spin connection and

The sole remaining constraint on the system is the locally scale covariant Einstein equation
with source cab, Eq.(122):
0 = D(α,x) (Ra + (1 + χ) ca) −WbRb
a −Wb2∆bc
da (Rc + (1 + χ) cc) ∧ed
which has been shown in [39] to be the condition for the existence of a conformal transformation
to the sourced Einstein equation when the source ca = cabeb is written as
cab = −


Tab −

n −1ηabT

We showed from the properties of cab that Tab is symmetric and divergence free, and in the
Riemannian gauge (in which the Weyl vector vanishes),
Rab −1
2ηabR = Tab
We conclude that the generic case describes the locally scale covariant n-dimensional Einstein
equation sourced by a symmetric, divergence free tensor and formulated on the co-tangent bundle
of spacetime. The reduction to n-dimensions is accomplished using only the ﬁeld equations with
vanishing torsion.
4. The non-abelian cases. When α, β and γ are chosen such that χ =
1
n−1

1 +
n2γ
(n−1)α−β

= −1,
G may be non-abelian, and there are substantial diﬀerences in the Cartan structure equations.
For these cases, we again showed the reduction to dependence on the spacetime solder form,
ea (x) , but now the ﬁnal forms of the curvature and dilatation are
Ωa
b

2Ca
bcd (α) ec ∧ed + 2∆ac

The curvature is subject to the scale-covariant vacuum Einstein equation,
Rec + D(x)
c φe + φeφc −1
2ηecφdφd = 0
For the co-torsion, Lorentz transformations are suppressed while the appearance of the G-connection
is automatic. This leads to the co-solder form becoming the G gauge ﬁeld and the spacetime co-
torsion becoming the usual Yang-Mills ﬁeld strength,
1
2SAcdec ∧ed
=
D(W)fA + 1
2c CD
A
fC ∧fD
where D(W)fA = dfA −fA ∧ω is the dilatation-covariant derivative. The biconformal space
becomes a principal G-bundle over spacetime.
Eﬀectively, the total principal bundle has homogeneous Weyl and G symmetry, W × G. This
is not what occurs if the original quotient is of the conformal group by inhomogeneous Weyl,
C(p,q)/IW, which essentially gives Poincaré ﬁbers over spacetime [43, 17]. The emergence of
non-abelian symmetry from the degrees of freedom of the special conformal gauge ﬁelds of the
conformal group is a new result. In 4-dimensions, with SO (p, q) = SO (4), the maximal G is the
electroweak symmetry with necessary parity violation.
8.2
A note on the metric and signature change
To formulate general relativity as a gauge theory using the Cartan techniques, we take the quotient of the
Poincaré group by the Lorentz group. The only guidance as to the metric is the presence of the Lorentzian
46

connection, which will leave the usual orthonormal metric, ηab = diag (−1, 1, 1, 1) invariant.
We then
introduce the metric by hand using the orthonormal frame ﬁeld, gαβ = e
a
α e
b
β ηab. The situation is diﬀerent
in biconformal space, where there are natural metric structures present. Of course, there is the SO (p, q)
connection, making it possible to introduce a (p, q) signature metric by hand, just as we do in general
relativity. However, the Killing form of the conformal group has a non-degenerate restriction to biconformal
space, and we may use this instead. The resulting metric on spacetime depends not only on the original
signature, but also on what submanifold is taken as spacetime.
Using the restricted Killing form, the metric is
KAB =
 0
δa
b
δb
a
0

and the restriction to the ea or fb subspaces has vanishing restriction. It is shown in [31], however, that
if we seek orthogonal Lagrangian submanifolds on which the Killing metric is non-degenerate, there are
limited possibilities, with initial spaces of signature (n, 0) ,
  n
2 , n
2

or (0, n) being the only consistent starting
points, and the two Euclidean cases leading uniquely to Lorentzian signature, (n −1, 1) or (1, n −1). This
development of a time direction from an initially Euclidean space is appealing.
There are other possibilities. If we drop the orthogonality requirement from the theorem of [31], it becomes
possible to have diﬀerent signature on the two Lagrangian submanifolds. This too has its advantages, as
we might arrange for Lorentzian signature on one submanifold and Euclidean on the other, enabling an
additional compact internal symmetry.
Some of these avenues have been explored. The Euclidean starting point leading to Lorentzian signature
on both Lagrangian submanifolds is studied in [22], in which all the results are seen to depend only on
structures inherent in the conformal group. In [32] connections of both types are introduced, and some
possibilities are explored in [45]. Work is currently underway to examine a 4 + 4 dimensional model with
mixed signatures, to take advantage of the potential graviweak theory.
There is still another metric possibility, because the metric compatible with the Kähler structure is
diﬀerent, having signature (2p, 2q) while the the Killing metric has signature (n, n).
For the present results, it seems best to simply impose the metric we choose. If we let the original
SO (p, q) be Lorentzian, SO (n −1, 1) then the natural choice for spacetime is Lorentzian (but see [22]).
8.3
Discussion
Biconformal spaces with appropriate signature give rise to general relativity, generically formulated on the
cotangent bundle of spacetime.
In a subclass of cases there may be an additional non-abelian internal
symmetry. While this internal symmetry ultimately arises from the special conformal transformations, no
previous gauging of the conformal group has shown the direct possibility of a non-abelian symmetry. This
opens the possibility of a graviweak uniﬁcation, which, while still requiring additional structure for the
strong force, holds out the hope of a deeper understanding of parity violation and the breaking of a left-right
symmetric SU (2) × SU (2) model. This possibility is under current investigation.
As described in the introduction, these gravity models may provide new insights into string theory. The
existence of a conformal route to general relativity, as opposed to fourth-order Weyl gravity, allows for the
consistent use of twistor string models. In addition, the doubled dimension makes possible a compactiﬁ-
cation from 10-dimensionsal superstring theory to an 8-dimensional biconformal space with an immediate
interpretation as 4-dimensional general relativity. In this way, the myriad 6-dimensional compact spaces are
avoided, to be replaced by compactiﬁcation of only 2-dimensions and possibly uniquely to a torus if other
structures are to be maintained.
Finally, this reduction of the biconformal gauging shares many features with Drinfeld doubles. The match
between the Killing form and the symmetric form of the Drinfeld product may suggest systematic ways of
reducing the doubles to their half-dimension.

Appendix A: Compactiﬁcation of spacetimes
Consider a ﬂat space S of signature (p, q), i.e., with indeﬁnite metric
ηab = diag


1, . . . , 1
| {z }
p
, −1, . . ., −1
|
{z
}
q



This space is noncompact due to curves heading oﬀto inﬁnite distance. We complete the space by appending
an inverse to every vector from the origin.
Let N be the set of null vectors from the origin, N =

xα|xβxβ = 0, xα ∈V
	
, and CN its complement,
CN =

xα|xβxβ ̸= 0, xα ∈V
	
.
For all points in CN, we consider the set,
W0 =
(
wα| wα = −xα
|x|2
)
where |x|2 = ηαβxαxβ. Notice that W0 contains no null vectors since this would require |x|2 = 0. Inverting
the transformation we have
xα
=
−wα
|w|2
50

so we see the mapping between xα and wα is a bijection.
We extend W0 by taking the union with a new set ˆ
W of points ˆwα satisfying
ˆ
W =

wα| ηαβ ˆwα ˆwβ = 0
	
Clearly ˆ
W ∩W0 = φ. We suggest that
W ≡ˆ
W ∪W0
provides a compactiﬁcation of the space.
If the signature is Euclidean, (p, q) = (n, 0), then N consists of the origin alone, and ˆ
W is the 1-point
compactiﬁcation of Rn.
More generally, a detailed proof of compactness must rely on the speciﬁcation of a topology on indeﬁnite
spaces. For general spacetimes this relies on introducing ideal points [46, 47, 48]. While such methods should
meet no obstruction in the ﬂat, nonsingular spaces considered here, the deﬁnition of the conformal group
requires only the existence of inverses. This much has already been accomplished with the deﬁnition of W.
We therefore content ourselves by deﬁning a suitable extension and indicating compactness by studying the
resulting extensions of spacetime curves.
First, consider a straight line that runs oﬀto inﬁnity in spacetime at half the speed of light,
C (λ) =

xα =

λ, λ
2 , 0, 0

This curve starts at the origin and reaches no endpoint in the original space, but in the compactiﬁcation we
may continue the curve to some ﬁnite value of λ = λ0 then change to wα coordinates,
C (λ0)
=

xα =

λ0, λ0


=

wα = 4

Deﬁne a new parameter, ξ = 1
λ and continue the curve
C (ξ)
=

wα = 4
3

ξ, 1
2ξ, 0, 0

We continue the curve through wα (0) and continue ξ to negative values. At some ﬁnite value, ξ = −ξ0 < 0,
we are at the point
wα
=
−4

This is a point in the past light cone. Letting λ′ = 1
ξ , we continue the path back to the origin as


and the curve is closed.
51

As an example of a curve reaching null inﬁnity (hence some nonzero null vector |w|2 = 0), consider the
accelerating curve
C (λ) = {xα = (a cosh λ, a sinh λ, 0, 0)}
with timelike norm
|x|2 = −a2
For this we choose a new parameter,
σ = tan−1 (sinh λ)
which approaches π
2 as λ →∞. The curve takes the form
xα
=
a
p
1 + tan2 σ, tan σ, 0, 0

At a value σ = π
2 we now have a null vector. We need to reparameterize the curve before this happens, so
set
wα
=
a
tan σ
p
1 + tan2 σ, tan σ, 0, 0

Now as σ approaches π
2 , wα is given by
wα (σ)
=
a
 r
1
tan2 σ + 1, 1, 0, 0
!
→
a (1, 1, 0, 0)
Let the parameterization of the curve in wα coordinates be ξ =
1
tan σ so that
wα (ξ) = a
p
1 + ξ2, 1, 0, 0

As ξ →0 this approaches a null vector, wα = (a, a, 0, 0), so we may now identify the limit σ →∞with the
null vector wα = (a, a, 0, 0). This vector is in the space, and we may again continue the curve to negative ξ.
Appendix B: Variation of the spin connection
Here we give details of the variation of the spin connection, since some of the steps are novel. Because many
of the expressions are long, we introduce some notational conventions to make expressions more compact and
transparent. Speciﬁcally, since all diﬀerential forms are rendered in boldface, there is no loss of information
if we assume wedge products between all adjacent forms, dropping the explicit wedge. We further deﬁne a
multi-index form,
ωc···d ≡ωcωc1 . . . ωd ≡ωc ∧ωc1 ∧. . . ∧ωd
for any number of basis 1-forms ωc. It is always possible to deduce the correct number of indices from the
Levi-Civita tensor.
The spin connection occurs only in the SO (p, q) curvature, Ωa
b, so the spin connection variation aﬀects
only the α term of the action,

The covariant derivatives of the basis forms divide naturally into two tensors, the torsion, Ta = Dea and
the co-torsion, Sa = Dfa. We show below that if both of these vanish, the solution must be trivial (i.e.,
non-gravitating) so it is important to realize when considering torsion-free solutions that the co-torsion Sa
remains non-zero.
The variation must preserve the antisymmetry, ηbcηadωc

the spacetime co-torsion is the obstruction to conformal Ricci ﬂatness.
