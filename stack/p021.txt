Abstract
The Cognitive Reﬂection Test (CRT) is a test designed to assess subjects’ ability to override
intuitively appealing but incorrect responses. Psychologists are concerned with whether subjects
improve their scores on the test with repeated exposure, in which case, the test’s predictive va-
lidity may be threatened. In this paper, we take a novel approach to modelling data recorded on
subjects who took the CRT multiple times. We develop bivariate, longitudinal models to describe
the responses, CRT score and time taken to complete the CRT. These responses serve as a proxy for
the underlying latent variables “numeracy” and “reﬂectiveness”, respectively—two components of
“rationality”. Our models allow for subpopulations of individuals whose responses exhibit similar
patterns. We assess the reasonableness of our models via new visualizations of the data. We esti-
mate their parameters by modifying the method of adaptive Gaussian quadrature. We then use our
ﬁtted models to address a range of subject-speciﬁc questions in a formal way. We ﬁnd evidence of
at least three subpopulations, which we interpret as representing individuals with differing combi-
nations of numeracy and reﬂectiveness, and determine that, in some subpopulations, test exposure
has a greater estimated effect on test scores than previously reported.

Introduction
The Cognitive Reﬂection Test (CRT) (Frederick, 2005) was
developed to assess a subject’s ability to override an in-
correct but intuitively appealing response (a so-called “gut
instinct”), a key component of rationality.
The CRT is a
short, three-question test that is predictive of many cogni-
tive abilities and tendencies (Bialek & Pennycook, 2018). It
was a precursor to the Comprehensive Assessment of Ra-
tional Thinking (CART), a more in-depth test of rational-
ity currently being developed (Stanovich, West, & Toplak,
2016). Both tests can provide information about subjects’
rationality. The CRT focuses speciﬁcally on numeracy, an
aspect of rationality concerned with the ability to reason
and apply concepts involving numbers (Attali & Bar-Hillel,
2020; Erceg, Galic, & Ruˇzojˇci´c, 2020). Numeracy in this con-
text can be operationalized as the number of correct re-
sponses to the test questions. The tests can also yield in-
sight into subjects’ reﬂectiveness, which we deﬁne as the
quality of considering a question carefully rather than re-
porting the ﬁrst response that springs to mind—using so-
called “System 2” thinking, as per Kahneman (2013). Re-
ﬂectiveness can be operationalized as time spent complet-
ing a test of rationality.
A key question in the literature is whether subjects tend
to improve their test scores over time (for example, via re-
peated exposure to the same test questions), in which case
the tests may not retain their predictive validity.
In the case of intelligence, an aspect of cognitive ability
that is related to (though distinct from) rationality, the lit-
erature provides no convincing evidence that intelligence
quotient (IQ) test scores improve over time (Haier, 2014).
But, with respect to rationality (as measured by scores on
the CRT or CART), the literature is so far sparse. The ﬁrst

authors to assess this question were Meyer, Frederick, and
Zhou (2018), who administered the CRT to subjects multi-
ple times over a predeﬁned time period.
They aﬃrmed
that test scores remain approximately stable over time, a
conclusion reached in other investigations as well (Stag-
naro, Pennycook, & Rand, 2018).
Our research extends the work of Meyer et al. (2018),
who attempt to answer various questions about changes in
subjects’ CRT scores over time. They use conventional lin-
ear regression modelling—regressing CRT score on the cur-
rent test exposure number and the total number of test ex-
posures. Furthermore, via various tables and graphs, they
present descriptive statistics that explore informally how
test scores change over time, e.g., they compare average
CRT scores for different values of other variables. These
models and expositions do not fully account for the longitu-
dinal nature of the data, the dependence among responses
measured on the same individual, the discreteness of the
test scores, or the role of other predictor variables. Though
Meyer et al. (2018) intimates that the CRT dataset suggests
the presence of subpopulations, their models do not incor-
porate them explicitly.
To address these limitations, we
develop a bivariate longitudinal model for these authors’
data. Our model describes the relationship between var-
ious predictors (including measures of prior exposure to
the test) and two dependent response variables: subjects’
score and time spent completing the test. We also present
an extension that allows a different bivariate longitudinal
model for different subpopulations of individuals via a la-
tent cluster variable.
Our model is a special case of the multiple longitudinal
outcome mixture model (MLOMM) developed by Kondo,
Zhao, and Petkau (2017), which is an extension of the gen-
eralized linear mixed model (GLMM) (Agresti, 2013) to in-
clude additional response variables and multiple latent
clusters. However, for estimating the parameters of these
models, we take a different approach from Kondo et al.
(2017), who use a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization
(MCEM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of a two-
cluster MLOMM. Speciﬁcally, we modify the adaptive Gaus-
sian quadrature (AGQ) approach proposed by Pinheiro and
Chao (2006) for estimating the parameters of GLMMs. Our
method allows for parameter estimation even in models
with more than two clusters.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the
next section, we describe the CRT dataset and provide
novel visualizations of its features. We then present our
models and new estimation method. Subsequently, we use
our models to address questions concerning the effect of
prior exposure and compare our ﬁndings with those pro-
vided by Meyer et al. (2018). We conclude with a discussion
of the analyses’ limitations and possible future work.
Cognitive Reﬂection Test Data
CRT data overview
The individuals in this study comprised over 14,000 sub-
jects from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)—a crowd-
sourcing website where volunteers can participate in
tasks—and over 28,000 observations across four separate
series of surveys. (See Appendix A for a discussion of the
reliability of MTurk samples.)
The data were collected
from November 2013 to April 2015. We chose the largest
series, Fall 2014 (which included observations from Sept.
3, 2014 to Jan. 12, 2015), to be the focus of our present
work. The raw dataset is available publicly from the Judg-
ment and Decision Making journal’s website (http://journal.
sjdm.org/vol13.3.html).
After data cleaning (see the next two sections), the Fall
2014 series consisted of 6,228 observations on 2,920 unique
subjects. The number of times that subjects took the test
varied, ranging from 1 to 15 within this series. Figure 1
summarizes the distribution of this variable.
Responses of interest
Meyer et al. (2018) treated CRT scores as the sole response
variable in their analyses (using the time that subjects
took to complete the test as a predictor in one). In con-
trast, we consider time to completion as a second response
variable.
We view test score and time to completion as
the operationalizations of numeracy and reﬂectiveness,
respectively—two components of rationality.
Individual
test scores range from 0 to 3 and completion times range
from 2 to 4002 seconds (or 0.69 to 8.29 log seconds).
Predictors
Various predictor variables may inﬂuence the distribution
of our two response variables. In this section, we discuss
our selection of these variables and our handling of id-
iosyncratic and missing values.
Our primary predictor of interest (the exposure vari-
able, in the language of causal inference) is the number of
times a subject has taken the CRT within the series, includ-
ing the current test. This variable is denoted by nPrevS
and takes values from 1 to 15. It is a time-varying, numeric
predictor. We acknowledge that subjects may have seen
the CRT questions prior to participating in this study, but
nPrevS remains our best objective measure of exposure.
Subjects self-reported the number of CRT questions
they had seen previously (numSeen), a numeric variable
taking values from 0 to 3. In theory, this predictor should
be time invariant after a subject’s ﬁrst test exposure, since
all returning subjects would have seen all three CRT items.
However, subjects don’t always report “3” after the ﬁrst

test exposure, and some even report decreasing values
over time.
Therefore, we had to determine whether to
keep the values as reported or to implement an appropri-
ate transformation. As Meyer et al. (2018) noted, the origi-
nal variable could be informative not only for its intended
purpose (measuring number of CRT items seen) but also
as a proxy for a subject’s memory of the CRT and math-
ematical ability. In this spirit, we convert it to a categor-
ical variable (denoted by memory), deﬁned as “0” when
nTotal=1 (i.e., the case where numSeen gives no infor-
mation about the true number of items seen by the sub-
ject), “1” when numSeen provides evidence of a faulty
memory (i.e., numSeen < 3 for any test exposure other
than the ﬁrst), and “2” when numSeen = 3 for nPrevS >
1 (i.e., the case where a subject may be reporting numSeen
correctly). Both numSeen and nPrevS measure familiar-
ity with the CRT—albeit one subjectively and the other ob-
jectively. However, memory presumably captures indirect
information about memory not reﬂected in nPrevS.
The predictor aveSATS refers to a subject’s standard-
ized average self-reported SAT score over the course of the
Fall 2014 series.
The binary categorical predictor male denotes a sub-
ject’s self-reported sex (with values of “0” and “1” cor-
responding to female and male, respectively). However,
male was not always constant throughout the series. In
the case of only two observations per subject with differ-
ent values of male, we exclude both observations; oth-
erwise, we replace discrepant values with the most com-
monly used value reported by the subject.
Next, age denotes a subject’s standardized,
self-
reported age, which we treat as continuous. Subjects had
to be at least 18 years old to participate. In most cases,
we use their self-reported age at ﬁrst exposure to avoid
time variance due to birthdays during the study period.
However, some subjects’ reported ages vary by more than
1 year, indicating errors. In these cases, if the values do
not vary too erratically, we either replace the discrepant
value(s) with the modal value or, in the case of no modal
value, we use the median value. If the discrepancies are
too great to make an educated modiﬁcation, we simply ex-
clude the observations.
Lastly, we also include nTotal, the total number of
times that a subject takes the test, as a predictor in our
models.
This choice mirrors that of Meyer et al. (2018)
in one of their analyses. Although Meyer et al. (2018) do
not provide an explanation for their choice, adjusting for
nTotal is sensible. Our rationale is that less motivated

subjects may be more likely to have both lower scores and
lower values of nTotal, i.e., we can view the differing val-
ues of nTotal as arising due to a missing test score prob-
lem. Including nTotal in the model is a way of adjusting
for subjects’ motivation; after this adjustment, we view the
missing test scores as missing at random.
Table 1 summarizes the response and predictor vari-
ables.
A substantial number of observations have missing val-
ues for at least one predictor. See Supplementary Informa-
tion for details on how we handled missing data.
Our ﬁnal dataset is intended to be a sample from the
population of relatively well-educated American adults. It
contains 6,228 observations from the Fall 2014 series.
Data visualization
We now provide further visualizations of the dataset to ex-
plore and motivate our proposed models in the next sec-
tion.
First, we examine the CRT score distribution.
His-
tograms of CRT score for different values of nPrevS are
shown in Figure 2 (we omit the cases where nPrevS
≥4 due to lack of data) and for different categories of
aveSATS at nPrevS = 1 in Figure 3. The former reveals
bathtub-shaped distributions for each value of nPrevS.
The latter reveals bathtub-shaped distributions for each of
the ﬁrst two categories of aveSATS and skewed left dis-
tributions with peaks at the maximum CRT score for the
ﬁnal two categories. Histograms of the distribution of CRT
score conditional on other predictor variables reveal simi-
lar shapes.
Figure 4 displays the distribution of the time response
(on the logarithmic scale), broken down by whether sub-
jects took the test once or multiple times. The graph reveals
an approximately normal distribution for both groups, i.e.,
for nPrevS = 1 and nPrevS >1. We also observe that
additional test exposures are associated with lower times
to completion. Histograms of completion time at different
levels of the other predictors (not shown) similarly reveal
approximately normal distributions but with no indication
of distributional differences among the different levels.
Next, Figure 5 displays the ordinary least squares (OLS)
estimates of the effects of nPrevS when CRT score (left)
and CRT log time to completion (right) are regressed on
nPrevS separately for each subject (for subjects who com-
pleted the test more than once). We do not make formal in-
ference based on these estimates; we use them simply for
visualizing the trends in subjects’ observed test scores and
completion times. The plot for CRT score reveals a peak at
0, describing the vast majority of subjects whose scores re-
mained constant over time. The majority of the remaining
estimates are greater than 0, with a small proportion less
than 0. The plot for time to completion has a peak near
0, with the majority of estimates being negative, implying
that subjects generally took less time to complete the test
with additional exposures. We also observe a small pro-
portion of subjects who spent an increasing amount of time
on additional exposures.
Lastly, we explore the changes in the two response vari-
ables over time. Of the 44% of subjects who appeared more
than once in the series, 73% had constant CRT scores, and
their average decrease in time spent completing the test
was 0.33 log seconds per additional test exposure; 18% had
increasing scores, with an average CRT score improvement
of 0.70 per additional test exposure and an average de-
crease in time spent of 0.27 log seconds; and 9% had de-
creasing CRT scores, with an average CRT score decrease
of 0.60 and an average decrease in time spent of 0.42 log
seconds. Although all subjects decreased their time spent
on subsequent tests, on average, in the aforementioned
groups (constant, decreasing, and increasing scores), this
decrease was least for the small subset who improved their
test scores over time.
The scatterplots in Figure 6 also illustrate the relation-
ship between changes in scores and completion times for
subjects who took the test multiple times. The left panel

Distribution of CRT score by nPrevS
Figure 3
Distribution of CRT score by aveSATS (for nPrevS=1)
shows subjects’ average log time to completion vs. changes
in test scores (as estimated by OLS, separately for each
subject).
This scatterplot suggests a positive correlation
between change in CRT score and average time spent on
the test, i.e., subjects who improved their scores tended
to spend more time on the test, and vice versa. The right
panel shows changes in log times to completion (also esti-
mated by OLS, separately for each subject) vs. changes in
test scores. Similarly, the second scatterplot suggests a pos-
itive correlation between change in CRT score and change
in completion time. In this case, subjects who improved
their scores (positive estimated effect of nPrevS on score)
tended to spend an approximately constant amount of time
on each test (estimated effect of nPrevS on completion
time of approximately 0). Subjects who did not improve
their scores (non-positive estimated effect of nPrevS on
score) tended to spend a decreasing amount of time on
each test (negative estimated effect of nPrevS on comple-
tion time).
These plots use data only from subjects who appeared
more than once in the series and whose ﬁrst test scores
were 0 or 1 (since only those subjects had the possibility of
improving their scores substantially). These statistics and
scatterplots are consistent with the observation by Meyer
et al. (2018) that a small proportion of subjects “continue
to spend time on the test”.

existence of subpopulations, we consider the class of mod-

els proposed by Kondo et al. (2017). In the following sec-
tions, we describe models that are appropriate for the CRT
data and, in particular, the computational challenges that
can arise in estimating their parameters. Ultimately, we
propose two models. The ﬁrst serves as our foundational
model for testing the hypotheses speciﬁed by Meyer et
al. (2018).
The second extends the ﬁrst to allow for the
description of subpopulations (“clusters”) of individuals
whose responses exhibit similar patterns (after adjusting
for predictor variables).
Models
Let Yij and Tij denote subject i’s CRT score and response
time (on the logarithmic scale), respectively, on the jth at-
tempt of the CRT, i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , ni. Since a sub-
ject is awarded one point for each correct answer on the
CRT, Yij ∈{0, 1, 2, 3}. In contrast, Tij takes values on the
real line. Throughout, we use the notation fG to denote the
probability mass (or density) function of a random vari-
able G.
Bivariate Longitudinal Model
Let xij denote the vector of predictor variables associated
with subject i on the jth attempt of the CRT. We model the
test scores as
Yij | Ui = ui ∼Binomial(3, θij),
where
logit(θij) = x′
ijβ + ui
and where the random effects, Ui, are independent and
distributed as N(0, σ2
u). We conceive of Ui as a latent vari-
able representing numeracy. Likewise, we model the loga-
rithm of the time to completion as
Tij | Vi = vi ∼N(µij, σ2
t ),
where
µij = x′
ijα + vi
and where the random effects, Vi, are independent and dis-
tributed as N(0, σ2
v). We conceive of Vi as a latent variable
representing reﬂectiveness. Among other implications, the
random effects allow for correlation among scores and
times to completion observed on the same individual.
We assume that Yij | Ui is independent of all other re-
sponse variables and Vi. We also assume that Tij | Vi is in-
dependent of all other response variables and Ui. Finally,
we assume that the joint distribution of the random effects
is bivariate normal, that is,

.
The purpose of allowing Ui and Vi to be correlated (via the
parameter ρ) is to allow dependence between any score
and any completion time observed on the same subject.
The assumption that test scores are conditionally bino-
mial distributed may, at ﬁrst, seem suspect because the out-
comes (correct/incorrect) of the three questions posed to
each individual at each exposure are not necessarily inde-
pendent with common probability of success. However,
Figures 2 and 3 help to justify the model for Yij | Ui. In
particular, the histograms of the CRT score responses for
given combinations of predictor variables reveal that the
marginal distribution of Yij has a “bathtub” shape. This
shape can be captured by a mixture of binomial distribu-
tions where the mixing distribution is a normal distribu-
tion, i.e., our speciﬁed distribution of Yij | Ui. We thus use
this model for the overall test scores but do not interpret
the scores as arising from a series of three independent tri-
als (questions) with a common probability of success (cor-
rectness).
Figure 4 motivates the model for Tij | Vi; the histogram
of the logarithm of time to completion given combinations
of predictor variables reveal that the marginal distribution
of Tij is approximately normal. From this perspective, the
proposed models for Tij | Vi and Vi (which imply that Tij
is normally distributed) are reasonable.
With these assumptions, we can write the likelihood as
a product of the conditional distributions:

where ψ = (β, α, σt, σu, σv, ρ) is the 20-dimensional vec-
tor of parameters to be estimated. We omit terms that are
constant with respect to the unknown parameters. In ad-
dition, we use superscripts with square brackets to denote
the number of clusters in the model.
Bivariate Longitudinal Model with Latent Clusters
Our second proposed model extends the ﬁrst model by pos-
tulating that test subjects comprise distinct clusters. We
justify this model on two grounds. First, Meyer et al. (2018),
as part of their analysis, imply that the presence of subpop-
ulations might drive some of their ﬁndings. Second, the
multi-cluster model can be seen as an alternative way to
represent the marginal distribution of the CRT scores de-
picted in Figures 2 and 3. In particular, this (bimodal) dis-
tribution could arise due to at least two distinct clusters of
individuals. Our original model can be considered a spe-
cial case of this extended model.
Let ¯xij be the vector of all predictor variables except
nPrevS observed on subject i at time j. Let sij be the
value of nPrevS observed on subject i at time j.
Let
Ci ∈{1, 2, . . . , K} be a latent cluster indicator. We as-
sume that the Ci’s are independent and distributed as
P(Ci = c) = γc.
As per our original model, we take
Ui and Vi to be random effects with normal distributions,
independent across subjects, representing numeracy and
reﬂectiveness, respectively (i.e., we now consider a model
with three latent variables rather than two). However, in
this case, the distributions of Ui and Vi describe variation
in numeracy and reﬂectiveness among subjects within a
given cluster rather than among subjects in the overall pop-
ulation. For our ﬁnal analysis, we ultimately make the sim-
plifying assumption that Ui and Vi are also independent
within subject (i.e., that ρ = 0). We discuss this choice
in more detail in the section titled “Fitted multi-cluster
model”. We take Yij | Ui = ui, Ci = ci to be distributed as
Binomial(3, θij), where
logit(θij) = βci0 + βci1sij + ¯x′
ijβ + ui,
where β = (β2, . . . , β7). We further assume that Tij |
Vi = vi, Ci = ci is distributed as N(µij, σ2
t ), where
µij = αci0 + αci1sij + ¯x′
ijα + vi.
The intercepts and effects of nPrevS are allowed to dif-
fer by cluster but, for parsimony, we assume that the other
regression coeﬃcients are common across clusters.

where ψ = (β, α, σt, σu, σv, γ2, . . . , γK) is the vector of
parameters to be estimated. (We exclude γ1 from ψ since
it can be computed as γ1 = 1 −PK
c=2 γc and hence is
not a free parameter.) Altogether, this model has 5K + 14
parameters to be estimated, so, for example, the 4-cluster
model has 34 parameters to be estimated.
Estimation
Direct maximization of the likelihoods (1) and (2) requires
integrating complex functions with respect to ui and vi.
These integrals do not have closed forms. We therefore
modify the adaptive Gaussian quadrature (AGQ) procedure
of Pinheiro and Chao (2006) to ﬁnd approximations to the
likelihoods. We then maximize these approximations to
obtain the (approximate) maximum likelihood estimates
(MLEs).
AGQ was originally proposed as an alternative to
Gauss-Hermite quadrature for approximating the likeli-
hood of a GLMM. As explained by Rabe-Hesketh and Skro-
ndal (2002), the key result underlying this method is that
the integrand is proportional to the posterior distribution
of the random effects, which, in turn, is approximately pro-
portional to a certain normal density. The integrand can
then be rewritten as a product of this density and an ap-
proximately constant function. Using this form of the in-
tegral and Gauss-Hermite quadrature (which allows exact
evaluation of integrals of low-degree polynomials with re-
spect to a normal density), leads to accurate and eﬃcient
evaluation of the likelihood. Although Pinheiro and Chao
(2006) developed the method for a univariate response and
a single cluster, we show in this section that the same argu-
ments can be used to justify its use when evaluating likeli-
hoods based on multivariate responses and multiple clus-
ters.
Our approach differs from that of Kondo et al. (2017),
who used MCEM to estimate the parameters in their multi-
cluster model. We chose our approach based on the expec-
tation of greater eﬃciency (given the results of Pinheiro
and Chao (2006) for the 1-cluster, univariate response case)
and because of challenges in achieving convergence when
applying the MCEM method when K > 2 (Y. Kondo, per-
sonal communication, September 12, 2020).
Let Q be the chosen number of Gauss-Hermite quadra-
ture points for evaluating one of the one-dimensional in-
tegrals in (2), and let zk and wk represent the kth ab-
scissa and weight, respectively, k = 1, . . . , Q.
Evaluat-
ing the two-dimensional integral will thus, in general, re-
quire Q2 quadrature points.
We use S = {(k1, k2) :
k1, k2 ∈{1, . . . , Q}} to index these points. We then deﬁne
k = (k1, k2) and zk = (zk1, zk2).
We summarize the iterative steps for maximum likeli-
hood estimation using AGQ as follows:
(a) Choose starting values of the model parameters, ψ.
(b) Using the current estimate of ψ, predict (Ui, Vi) by nu-
merically maximizing
gUi,Vi(ui, vi) = log{fYi,Ti|Ui,Vi(yi, ti | ui, vi)×
fUi,Vi(ui, vi)}.
Deﬁne µAi = (ˆui, ˆvi) as the maximizer of g() and let
ΣAi =

∇2gUi,Vi(ˆui, ˆvi)
	−1.
(c) Let Bi = (Ui, Vi). Deﬁne bik = Σ1/2
Ai zk + µAi and
Wk = exp(||zk||2)wk1wk2.
Then numerically maxi-
mize the approximate log-likelihood (Eq. 3 below) to
obtain an updated estimate of ψ.
(d) Repeat steps 2–3 until convergence (deﬁned as the
event that the maximum difference across consecutive
parameter estimates is less than some chosen value).

The details of this procedure appear in Appendix C.
When Q = 1, this approximation is the Laplace ap-
proximation.
Higher values of Q lead to greater accu-
racy, however, and are thus preferable. Pinheiro and Chao
(2006) argue that Q ≤7 is generally suﬃcient in the uni-
variate, 1-cluster case. In our case, we started with Q = 15
and then gradually increased Q (to a maximum of 50) to
ensure stability of the parameter estimates.
In general,
Q = 35 seemed to be suﬃcient.
Similarly, the convergence criterion chosen in step 3
can be weak for the initial iterations of the algorithm and
more stringent for later iterations.
To obtain starting values for the parameters in the
1-cluster model, we ﬁrst ﬁt separate (generalized) linear
mixed models to the CRT scores and completion times,
treating these responses as independent. This approach is
equivalent to ﬁtting our 1-cluster model with ρ = 0. We
then used these parameter estimates—along with 0 for ρ—
as starting values for ﬁtting the general 1-cluster model.
For our multi-cluster models, we used the MLEs of the pa-
rameters of the 1-cluster model (with some added jitter)
as starting values, treating the parameters associated with
each cluster (including the cluster probabilities) as close to
identical.
Implementation
We implemented our proposed methods in R. We used the
function GLMMadaptive::mixed_model to ﬁt the bi-
nomial generalized linear mixed model to the score data
and the lme4::lmer function to ﬁt the linear mixed
model to the completion time data (as described in the “Es-
timation” section).
We used the nlm function for maxi-
mizing objective functions and the package gaussquad to
obtain the Gauss-Hermite quadrature points and weights.
Otherwise, we wrote our own code available on the jour-
nal’s web site.
Results
We now present our ﬁtted models and use them to answer
a variety of ﬁeld-related questions.
Fitted 1-cluster model
Recall that the primary question of Meyer et al. (2018) is
whether CRT scores increase with number of test expo-
sures, adjusting for the other predictor variables. In this
section, we address this question using our 1-cluster model
(ﬁt with Q = 35), which builds on the work of these au-
thors by describing the test scores and completion times
simultaneously and longitudinally.
The 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) for β1 (the coeﬃcient
of nPrevS) is [0.055, 0.117]. This estimate is diﬃcult to in-
terpret concisely because it has a complicated relationship
with the mean test score. However, we can estimate and
compare mean test scores for different values of nPrevS
and the other predictor variables. Table 3 presents esti-
mated mean CRT scores (and their standard errors) for dif-
ferent values of nPrevS and nTotal using our ﬁtted 1-
cluster model. The standardized predictors aveSATS and
age are set to 0, male is set to 1, and memory is set to 0
(i.e., these estimates are for male subjects with average SAT
score, average age, and for whom we have no information
about memory).
The ﬁrst row of estimated mean CRT scores is for an av-
erage subject, that is, for a subject with U = 0. The second
row is for the population of subjects, obtained using AGQ to
determine the required marginal distribution of CRT score.
When holding aveSATS, age, male, and memory ﬁxed
at the values speciﬁed, for each additional test exposure,
the estimated mean CRT score for an average subject in-
creases by about 0.046. More speciﬁcally, considering only
the values of nTotal and consecutive values nPrevS rep-
resented in the table, the estimated increase ranges from
0.039 to 0.053 (each with a standard error of approximately
0.003). On the other hand, the estimated mean score in
the population of subjects with these predictor values in-
creases by about 0.031, with estimated increases (for the
chosen range of values of nTotal and nPrevS) lying be-
tween 0.030 and 0.032 (with standard errors lying between
0.008 and 0.010).
The estimated (approximate) per exposure increase in
mean CRT score for an average subject (0.046) contrasts
with the estimated 0.024 increase reported by Meyer et al.
(2018), who used OLS to estimate this effect by regressing
CRT score on nPrevs and nTotal. However, the 0.024
estimate is based on the entire dataset and does not ad-
just for the other predictors. Using just the Fall 2014 data
and all the predictors, the OLS-estimated effect of nPrevS
is 0.017. Overall, we agree with Meyer et al. (2018) that
repeated test exposure has a small but non-trivial effect
on test scores. But, because we are able to compute stan-
dard errors for the estimated mean score increases (for
speciﬁed values of the predictors), our conclusion is more
strongly justiﬁed.
We estimate that mean time to completion decreases
by 0.114 (95% CI [0.104, 0.124]) log seconds for each addi-
tional test exposure (for both an average subject and in the
population).
Meyer et al. (2018) reported slightly negative correla-
tions between CRT score and time to completion within
subject (for those who took the test at least twice). We take
a different but related approach by estimating the correla-
tion of our random effects, ρ. The weak, negative estimated
correlation of −0.066 (95% CI [−0.123, −0.010]) is consis-
tent with the ﬁndings of Meyer et al. (2018). This estimate

suggests that our two response variables are weakly nega-
tively correlated after accounting for variation due to the
predictors.
Fitted multi-cluster model
We now present the results of ﬁtting our multi-cluster
model, an alternative way to describe the observed pat-
terns in the data.
As mentioned in the “Bivariate Longitudinal Model
with Latent Clusters” section, we chose to specify ρ = 0 in
our ﬁnal model. We justify this choice on the basis that the
latent clusters allow for correlation between Yij and Tij,
therefore reducing the need to allow for additional corre-
lation via ρ. This argument is supported by the data: ρ did
not differ signiﬁcantly from 0 in the 3-cluster model with
nPrevS as the only predictor variable and Q = 15 (results
not shown). Given that the latter took weeks to ﬁt (com-
pared to less than two days to ﬁt the 3-cluster model with
all the predictors and ρ = 0), massive reduction in compu-
tational effort also motivates our decision.
To choose K, the number of clusters, we ﬁt the model
with ρ = 0 for K ∈{1, 2, 3, 4} (using Q = 50) and ob-
tained the maximum values of the log-likelihoods (see Ta-
ble 4). We do not formally compare the ﬁts of these models
because the likelihood ratio test statistics do not have the
usual chi-squared distributions. However, informally, we
can compare the AIC values (deﬁned as −2 times the max-
imized log-likelihood plus twice the number of model pa-
rameters) associated with the models. The AIC is lowest for
the 4-cluster model, suggesting that that model provides
the best description of the data of the four models consid-
ered. Moreover, as we discuss below, the 4-cluster model is
highly interpretable with respect to the psychometric con-
cerns that we laid out in the introduction. Therefore, while
Table 4 displays parameter estimates and standard errors
for all four models, from this point on, we focus our atten-

tion on the ﬁtted 4-cluster model.
We ﬁrst consider our primary question of interest, i.e.,
the effect of repeat exposures on test score. The 95% CIs
for β11, β21, β31, and β41 (the effects of nPrevS for clusters
1–4) are [0.013, 0.135], [−0.005, 0.077], [0.013, 0.425] and
[0.566, 1.044], respectively. The CI for effect of nPrevS in
cluster 4 does not overlap with the corresponding CIs for
clusters 1-3. These ﬁndings suggest that the effect of repeat
exposures on test scores is positive in each subpopulation
and that these effects differ across some subpopulations.
The 95% CIs for many of the estimated intercepts do not
overlap. Speciﬁcally, the CI for β10, [−1.458, −0.694], does
not overlap with the CI for β20 or β30 ([0.106, 0.972] and
[−0.431, 0.655], respectively). And the CI for β40 ([−2.510,
−0.582]) does not overlap with that for β20 or β30. These
results suggest distinct mean initial CRT scores among the
clusters.
Focusing now on our second response variable, time to
completion, the 95% CIs for the estimated effects of nPrevS
are [−0.281, −0.215], [−0.065, −0.041], [−0.734, −0.570],
and [−0.090, −0.012] in clusters 1–4, respectively. These
CIs are mostly non-overlapping, suggesting that effect of
nPrevS on completion time differs across all clusters.
None of the 95% CIs for the estimated intercepts over-
laps except for those in the ﬁrst and fourth clusters, sug-
gesting distinct mean initial completion times among the
clusters.
The CIs for the estimated intercepts are [4.23,
4.51], [3.27, 3.47], [5.48, 6.02], and [4.28, 4.83] for clusters 1-
4, respectively.
We now turn to the interpretation of the clusters. We
ground our interpretations within the mindware instanti-
ation continuum; see Stanovich, Toplak, and West (2008).
Mindware refers to the ability to deploy various men-
tal tools to improve problem-solving and decision-making.

Problems with mindware can impair one’s performance.
Speciﬁcally, a mindware gap refers to lacking the afore-
mentioned tools, while contaminated mindware refers to
having faulty such tools. Accordingly, all other factors be-
ing equal, we view low and high initial scores as indicative
of low and high levels of numeracy, respectively. Likewise,
we view low and high initial completion times as indicative
of low and high levels of reﬂectiveness, respectively. Mind-
ware levels can relate to both latent variables: low mind-
ware levels can correspond to lower numeracy (producing
lower test scores) and can prevent subjects from reﬂection
(leading to lower completion times). In principle, we ex-
pect the scores of individuals who are highly reﬂective to
increase over time. However, we cannot always observe
such increases due to the serious ceiling effect (the max-
imum score achievable was 3) and the fact that subjects
may have seen the test answers prior to participating in
the study. With these considerations in mind, we interpret
the subpopulations represented in the 4-cluster model as
follows:
Cluster 1. The ﬁrst cluster consists of subjects who are
less numerate and moderately reﬂective. In other words,
these subjects have low mindware levels, which prevents
them from scoring highly and limits their ability to im-
prove with time. They score relatively low initially (low es-
timated intercept, ˆβ10) and only slightly higher over time.
They spend an average amount of time on their ﬁrst test
(middling estimated intercept, ˆα10) and spend less and less
time on each subsequent test (middling estimated effect of
nPrevS, ˆα11). Cluster 1 has an estimated cluster probabil-
ity of 0.448 (95% CI [0.374, 0.521]).
Cluster 2.
The second cluster corresponds to peo-
ple who are more numerate than average or who have
seen the test before and remember the answers. In other
words, these subjects likely possess higher mindware lev-
els, which allows them to score highly and respond quickly.
They score moderately high initially (moderately high es-
timated intercept, ˆβ20).
Since their initial scores are so
close to the maximum of 3, they are unable to increase
their scores substantially over time (the estimated effect
of nPrevS, ˆβ21, is not signiﬁcantly different from 0). Sub-
jects in this cluster spend a relatively low amount of time
on their ﬁrst test (low estimated intercept, ˆα20) and slightly
less time on subsequent tests (slightly negative estimated
effect of nPrevS, ˆα21). However, we cannot infer that sub-
jects in this group are less reﬂective than average; to make
such a statement, we would need to administer a new test
without such a severe ceiling effect—one that would chal-
lenge the highly numerate subjects and allow the subset
of highly reﬂective subjects (i.e., subjects with higher com-
pletion times) the possibility of achieving higher scores, on
average, than their less reﬂective counterparts. Cluster 2
has an estimated cluster probability of 0.362 (95% CI [0.276,
0.449]), implying that clusters 1 and 2 are the largest sub-
populations.
Cluster 3. The third cluster represents subjects who
are less numerate but more reﬂective than average.
In
other words, these subjects possess moderately developed
mindware, as seen by their initially moderately high scores
(moderately high estimated intercept, ˆβ30) and only slight
score improvements over time (low estimated effect of
nPrevS, ˆβ31).
They spend a relatively high amount of
time on their ﬁrst test (high estimated intercept, ˆα30) but
much less time on each subsequent test (low estimated ef-
fect of nPrevS, ˆα31). With an estimated cluster probabil-
ity of 0.134 (95% CI [0.062, 0.206]), this subpopulation is the
smallest.
Cluster 4. The fourth cluster consists of subjects who
are the least numerate but the most reﬂective. Thus, like
subjects in cluster 3, they possess moderately developed
mindware, expressed in this case by higher levels of re-
ﬂectiveness that counteract the lower levels of numeracy.
Speciﬁcally, they score very low initially (very low esti-
mated intercept, ˆβ40) and increase their scores over time
much more dramatically than other subjects (very high es-
timated effect of nPrevS, ˆβ41). They spend a relatively
high amount of time on their ﬁrst test (high estimated in-
tercept, ˆα40) and slightly less time on each subsequent test
(near-zero estimated effect of nPrevS, ˆα41). With an es-
timated cluster probability of 0.056 (95% CI [0.024, 0.087]),
this subpopulation is one of the smallest.
The interpretation of these four clusters is consistent
with the patterns evident in Figure 6 and the observation
by Meyer et al. (2018) that the improvement in test scores
over time is driven by a small minority of subjects. In con-
trast, our other models appear to blend heterogeneous re-
sponse patterns, resulting in substantially higher AIC val-
ues.
Additional results
In this section, we report on the effects of predictors other
than nPrevS on CRT score and time to completion. We fo-
cus our discussion on the interpretation of the effects in the
1-cluster model. However, our overall conclusions apply to
the effects in the multi-cluster models as well.
The estimated effect of the faulty memory indicator,
memory, is strongly negative (95% CI [−1.711, −0.919]).
That is, subjects who incorrectly self-reported their prior
number of exposures were more likely to score lower on
the CRT. The estimated effect of the good memory indicator
was also signiﬁcant (95% CI [0.080, 0.688]), similarly sug-
gesting that subjects who correctly self-reported their prior

of Meyer et al. (2018) that, among subjects who are known
to have seen all three CRT questions previously (because
they have taken the test at least once before), average CRT
score increases with the number of CRT questions they re-
port having seen.
We found aveSATS to have a very inﬂuential, positive
effect on CRT score (95% CI [0.990, 1.230] for β4), reaﬃrm-
ing the commonly reported ﬁnding in the literature that
CRT and SAT scores are positively correlated and useful
predictors of one another, e.g., Frederick (2005). While this
association exists, Stanovich et al. (2016) has shown that
rationality and intelligence are distinct. That is, they are
characterized by different cognitive processes and predict
different outcomes and traits. We also found aveSATS to
have a weak, negative effect on time to completion (95% CI
[−0.010, −0.049] for α4).
Moreover, we found that nTotal was an important
predictor for both response variables (95% CI [0.047, 0.185]
for β7, and 95% CI [−0.074, −0.046] for α7 in the 1-cluster
model). Those who choose to take the test many times may
be more motivated (both in terms of answering the ques-
tions correctly and in terms of earning money), which may
lead to higher test scores and less time spent taken to com-
plete the test.
Finally, we ﬁnd a large, positive effect of male on CRT
score (95% CI [0.678, 1.152] for β5), a moderate-to-weak
positive effect of age on CRT score (95% CI [0.145, 0.373]
for β6), and insigniﬁcant effects of male (95% CI [−0.031,
0.079] for α5) and age (95% CI [−0.037, 0.013] for α6) on
time to completion. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
effects of sex and age on CRT test scores that have been re-
ported in the literature (Zhang, Highouse, & Rada, 2016).
Model assessment
As an informal check of the ﬁt of our 1- and 4-cluster mod-
els, we compare the empirical distributions of CRT scores
and times to completion at nPrevS=1 to the estimated dis-
tributions of the score and time responses using parameter
estimates from our ﬁtted models (listed in Table 4). See Ap-
pendix D for the relevant plots and further details. The
empirical and estimated distributions of CRT scores cor-
respond reasonably well, and the empirical and estimated
distributions of completion times correspond very closely.
Discussion
We expect that our models provide more trustworthy esti-
mates and associated standard errors of the effect of test
exposure (and the other covariates) on CRT score and time
to completion than the original models used by Meyer et
al. (2018). Our rationale is that 1) our models more ap-
propriately account for the repeated measures within in-
dividual, using information from all exposures rather than
simply the difference between ﬁnal and initial scores; 2)
we consider the two response variables jointly, thus us-
ing the information in all the available data to estimate
the model parameters; 3) we make more defensible distri-
butional assumptions with the aid of our novel visualiza-
tions (see the data visualization section)—namely, we treat
the CRT score response as conditionally binomial rather
than marginally normal; and 4) our approach allows for
the presence of subpopulations. Our ﬁndings suggest that,
contrary to the conclusions of Meyer et al. (2018), the CRT’s
predictive validity is sometimes weakened upon repeated
exposure, e.g., in the case of individuals in the subpopula-
tions represented by clusters 3 and 4 in our 3- and 4-cluster
models.
Our work is also a contribution to the understanding
of two important components of rationality:
numeracy
and reﬂectiveness.
In particular, our models have nice
interpretations in terms of these constructs. Our ﬁtted 1-
cluster model shows that, in the overall population, numer-
acy and reﬂectiveness are negatively correlated. However,
when considering subpopulations (via our ﬁtted 3-cluster
model), we ﬁnd no evidence of correlation between these
constructs.
From a statistical perspective, our proposed method for
parameter estimation based on AGQ is another contribu-
tion. Based on preliminary simulation studies, our method
is eﬃcient and provides accurate estimates of the parame-
ters in both the 1- and multi-cluster models.
An alternative estimation method that we consid-
ered was the EM algorithm, using Gaussian quadrature
methods—rather than Monte Carlo methods, as proposed
by Kondo et al. (2017)—in the E-step.
We expected that
this algorithm, which transforms the problem of maximiz-
ing the log-likelihood into a series of smaller maximization
problems, would result in fewer convergence issues and
be less sensitive to starting values. However, to obtain ac-
curate approximations to the integrals in the E-step using
Gauss-Hermite quadrature, a prohibitively large number
of quadrature points were required.
AGQ, suggested by
Hall and Wang (2005), was similarly computationally bur-
densome since the integrands in the E-step are not propor-
tional to the posterior distribution of the random effects—
the key requirement for the eﬃciency of this method. In
the end, direct maximization of the log-likelihood (which
does involve an integrand that is proportional to the pos-
terior distribution of the random effects) using AGQ and
carefully chosen starting values was the most eﬃcient and
effective estimation method we examined.
Regarding our choice to assume that the random ef-
fects are normally distributed, our review of the relevant
literature provides some alleviation of concerns about the
ramiﬁcations of misspecifying these distributions. In the

linear mixed model setting, Butler and Louis (1992) and
Verbeke and Lesaffre (1997) demonstrated that incorrectly
specifying the distribution of the random effects has a neg-
ligible effect on the ﬁxed-effect estimates.
Likewise, in
the generalized linear mixed model setting, McCulloch and
Neuhaus (2011) conclude that “most aspects of statistical
inference are highly robust to [assuming a normal distri-
bution for the random effects]”. An exception is the case
where the true random effects distribution depends on the
predictors—see Heagerty and Zeger (2000). In the end, we
justify our choice of distributions for the random effects
by assessing the appropriateness of the implied marginal
distributions of the responses.
Caution is required in terms of the generalizability of
our results. Though MTurk participants are generally re-
garded as reasonably representative of the population (see
Appendix A), our decision to include only observations
with self-reported SAT scores (see Supporting Information)
is presumably representative of more educated American
adults.
We have numerous ideas for further work in this area.
One involves extending our bivariate longitudinal model
by treating CRT score as conditionally multinomial rather
than binomial. This approach was used by Campitelli and
Gerrans (2013), who expanded the categories of incorrect
CRT responses to distinguish between wrong “intuitive”
answers (for example, the “$0.10” answer on the Bat &
Ball problem, or “24 days” on the Lilypads problem) and
wrong “idiosyncratic” answers (wrong answers other than
the “intuitive” ones).
Adopting this approach in the bi-
variate longitudinal model context may prove informative,
though would be even more computationally burdensome.
Overall, our novel approach in modelling the CRT data
allows us to rigorously address key questions of interest
in the cognitive psychology and psychometric literature.
In addition, our explicit incorporation of numeracy and
reﬂectiveness in our models paves the way for future re-
search in this area.

Appendix A: MTurk Reliability
Paolacci, Chandler, and Ipeirotis (2010) assess the quality of Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participant samples by comparing
MTurk samples to university/college student laboratory samples and Internet samples. They proposed various criteria
with which to judge the representativeness of MTurk samples as well as the overall quality of the data the samples pro-
duce. This work involved looking at demographic factors (e.g., age, sex, race, and education) and statistical properties of
the samples (e.g., coverage error, non-response error, subject motivation, and experimenter effects). Past surveys found
that 70-80% of MTurks were from the U.S. More women than men participated (65% vs. 35%). The sample mean and
median ages were 36 and 33, respectively, which are slightly lower than those of both the U.S. population and typical
Internet users. All MTurk participants must have a U.S. bank account. Paolacci et al. (2010) summarize, “Our demo-
graphic data suggests that Mechanical Turk workers are at least as representative of the U.S. population as traditional
subject pools, with sex, race, age and education of Internet samples all matching the population more closely than college
undergraduate samples and Internet samples in general. . . ”.
MTurks are thus thought to be an inexpensive, relatively high quality source of data for psychological experiments.
For this reason, we are comfortable with treating our MTurk sample as representative of a relatively well-educated
American population for the purpose of our analyses.
Appendix B: CRT Questions
The following questions comprise the CRT:
(1) A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
cents
(2) If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
minutes
(3) In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the
entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?
days
Modiﬁed versions of these questions were given in the other series that we excluded in our analysis.
Appendix C: Details of the AGQ Algorithm
We ﬁrst deﬁne the logarithm of the joint density of our response variables and random effects as
gUi,Vi(ui, vi) = log

fYi,Ti|Ui,Vi(yi, ti | ui, vi)fUi,Vi(ui, vi)
	
.
We then maximize gUi,Vi(ui, vi) by computing (ˆui, ˆvi) such that ∇gUi,Vi(ˆui, ˆvi) = 0. Using a Laplace approximation of
gUi,Vi(ui, vi) around (ˆui, ˆvi), we can show that exp {gUi,Vi(ui, vi)}—and hence the posterior distribution of (Ui, Vi)—is
approximately proportional to a normal density with mean µAi = (ˆui, ˆvi) and variance ΣAi =

∇2gUi,Vi(ˆui, ˆvi)
	−1.
Let φ(·; µAi, ΣAi) be the density of a bivariate normal random variable with mean µAi and variance-covariance
matrix ΣAi. Deﬁning Bi = (Ui, Vi), we next rewrite the marginal density of (Yi, Ti) as
fYi,Ti(yi, ti)

φ(bi; µAi, ΣAi) dbi.

The Laplace approximation result implies that the term {·} is approximately constant with respect to bi. Consequently,
we can use Gauss-Hermite quadrature with relatively few quadrature points to evaluate this integral with high accuracy.
In particular, substituting bi = Σ1/2
Ai z∗
i + µAi, we can write
fYi,Ti(yi, ti)
=

Appendix D: Model Assessment
To provide an informal check of our 1- and 4-cluster model ﬁt, Figure 7 displays both the empirical CRT score and time to
completion responses, along with their respective estimated marginal distributions under the two models. Speciﬁcally,
we computed the estimated distributions for each individual (using each model’s parameter estimates) and then averaged
these distributions over all individuals.
For the score response, we estimate the probabilities of each CRT score using the estimated parameters and the ob-
served predictor values, restricted to nPrevS = 1. Since the marginal distribution of Yij does not have a closed form,
we use Gauss-Hermite quadrature with 100 quadrature points to approximate the four probabilities. The bars on the left-
most plot correspond to the empirical probability of each CRT score, while the purple and red horizontal lines correspond
to the probabilities estimated using our 1- and 4-cluster models, respectively.
For time to completion, the marginal distribution has a closed form, namely
Tij ∼N(µij, σ2
v + σ2
t ),
where
µij = x′
ijα.
The histogram on the right reﬂects the empirical distribution of time to completion. The purple and red curves are the
estimated marginal distributions of completion time based on our 1- and 4-cluster models, respectively.
