Note to the Students
The JEE (Main & Advanced) is one of the hardest exams to crack for 
students, for a very simple reason – concepts cannot be learned by rote, 
they have to be absorbed, and IIT believes in strong concepts. Each 
question in the JEE (Main & Advanced) entrance exam is meant to push 
the analytical ability of the student to its limit. That is why the questions 
are called brainteasers!
Students find Mathematics the most difficult part of JEE (Main & 
Advanced). We understand that it is difficult to get students to love 
mathematics, but one can get students to love succeeding at mathematics. 
In order to accomplish this goal, the book has been written in clear, concise, 
and inviting writing style. It can be used as a self-study text as theory is well 
supplemented with examples and solved examples. Wherever required, 
figures have been provided for clear understanding.
If you take full advantage of the unique features and elements of this 
textbook, we believe that your experience will be fulfilling and enjoyable. 
Let’s walk through some of the special book features that will help you in 
your efforts to crack JEE (Main & Advanced).
To crack mathematics paper for JEE (Main & Advanced) the five things 
to remember are:
1. Understanding the concepts 
2. Proper applications of concepts 
3. Practice 
4. Speed 
5. Accuracy 
About the Cover Picture
The picture on the cover is Jatiyo Smriti Soudho or National Martyrs' 
Memorial – a monument located in Savar, Bangladesh – which is built 
to commemorate the valour and the sacrifice of those killed in the 
Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. The monument is composed of seven 
isosceles triangular pyramid shaped towers, with the middle one being the 
tallest, that is, 150 feet. The arrangement of the seven towers is unique. The 
planes are arranged uniquely so that one can see its distinctive patterns 
when looking at it from different angles.

CLEAR, CONCISE, AND INVITING WRITING 
Special attention has been paid to present an 
engaging, clear, precise narrative in the layout 
that is easy to use and designed to reduce 
math anxiety students may have.
DEFINITIONS
Every new topic or concept starts with 
defining the concept for students. Related 
examples to aid the understanding follow the 
definition.

DEFINITION 4.1  Cone Let S be a non-empty set of points in the space. Then, S is called a cone if there ex-
ists a point V
S
  such that the line VP
F E
HH
 is contained in S for all points P in S. This point V is 
called the vertex of the cone and the line VP
F E
HH
 where P
S
  is called generator of the cone S.
 Examples 
(1) Every line is a cone with every point on the line as 
vertex and the line is the only generator.
(2) Every plane is a cone with all of its points as vertices.
(3) Two intersecting planes form a cone with every point 
on their line of intersection as vertex.
DEFINITION 4.2  Degenerate and Non-degenerate Cones The cones described in the examples of Definition 4.1 
are called degenerate cones. Generally, cones that are having more than one vertex are called 
degenerate cones. Cones which do not degenerate are called non-degenerate cones. Using the 
three-dimensional analytic geometry (Chapter 6), we can verify that the locus represented by the 
equation x
y
z

 is a cone with origin as the vertex.
DEFINITION 4.3  Base Curve or Guiding Curve If a plane is not passing through the vertex and intersects all 
the generators of a cone, then the intersection of the plane and the cone are called base curve 
or guiding curve.
DEFINITION 4.4  Circular Cone and Right Circular Cone If the base curve is a circle, then it is called a circular 
cone (see Fig. 4.1). If the base curve is a circle and the line connecting the centre of the base 
and the vertex of the cone is perpendicular to the plane of the circle, then the cone is called 
right circular cone.

EXAMPLES 
Examples pose a specific problem using 
concepts already presented and then work 
through the solution. These serve to enhance 
the students’ understanding of the subject 
matter.
 Example    2.13
Write 2x  3y  5  0 in the normal form. What is the dis-
tance of the line from origin?
Solution: In 2x  3y  5  0, the constant 5 should be 
taken to the RHS of the equation, that is
2x  3y  −5
Dividing both sides with

TRY IT OUT 
Within each chapter the students would find 
problems to reinforce and check their under-

as one progresses in the chapter. These are 
marked with a pointed finger.
SUMMARY 
At the end of every chapter, a summary is pre-
sented that organizes the key formulae and 
theorems in an easy to use layout. The related 
topics are indicated so that one can quickly 
summarize a chapter.
2.1. Slope of line: Let l be a non-vertical line (i.e., l is not 
parallel to y-axis) making an angle P with the posi-
tive direction of x-axis. Then, tan P is called the slope 
of the line l. Generally, the slope of a line is denoted 
by m.
Caution: The concept of slope is followed only for 
non-vertical lines.
Note: Slope of a horizontal line (which is parallel to 
x-axis) is always zero.
2.2. If A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) are two points on a non- 
vertical line, then the slope of the line AB

 is y

2.3. Intercepts on the axes: If a line l meets x-axis at 
(a, 0) and y-axis at (0, b), then a is called x-intercept 
and b is called y-intercept of the line l.
2.4. Equations of the axis: The equation of x-axis is y  0 
and the equation of y-axis is x  0.
2.5. Various forms of straight line equations:
1. Two-point form: Equation of the line passing 
through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is
(x – x1) (y1 – y2)  (y – y1) (x1 – x2)
2. Point–slope form: Equation of the line which is 
having slope m and passing through the point 
(x1, y1) is
y – y1  m(x – x1)
3. Symmetric form: If a non-vertical makes an angle 
P with the positive direction of x-axis and passes 
through a point (x1, y1), then its equation is

Note: In the above relation, if we consider that 
each ratio is equal to r (real number), then every 
point on the line is of the form (x1  rcosP, y1  
rsinP). Also r  gives the distance of the point (x, y) 
on the given line from the fixed point (x1, y1).
4. Intercept form: If a and b are x and y intercepts of a 
line (ab x 0), then the line equation is x

5. Slope–intercept form: The equation of a non-
vertical line which is having slope m and 
y-intercept c is
y  mx  c
Note: Equation of any line (except the y-axis) 
passing through origin is the form y  mx.
6. Normal form: Let l be a line whose distance from 
the origin is ON ( p) and ON  make an angle @ 
with the positive direction of the x-axis. Then, the 
equation of the line l is x cos @  y sin @   p.
2.6. Definition (first-degree equation): If a, b and c are 
real and either a or b is not zero, then ax  by  c is 
called first-degree expression in x and y and ax  by  
c  0 is called first-degree equation in x and y.
2.7. Theorem: Every first-degree equation in x and y rep-
resents a straight line and the equation of any line in 
the coordinate plane is a first-degree equation in x 
and y.
2.8. General equation of a straight line: First-degree 
equation in x and y is called the general equation of 
a straight line.

SUBJECTIVE PROBLEMS 
Since geometry requires a lot of practice, some 
chapters in addition provide numerous solved 
examples in the pattern of  Subjective Problems. 
We have provided such problems within the 
chapter, near to the concept.
Subjective Problems
1. If p1 and p2 are the distances between the opposite 
sides of a parallelogram and @ is one of its angles, 
then show that the area of the parallelogram is p1p2 
cosec@.
Solution: ABCD is a parallelogram (see Fig. 2.18). AM 
 p1, DN  p2 and  BAD  @.
Area of the parallelogram  (AB) p2 
(2.17)
Now from $AMP, sin@  p1/AB and hence we have AB  
p1 cosec@. Therefore, from Eq. (2.17), the area of the par-
allelogram  p1p2 cosec@.

1.1 Rectangular Coordinates
Geometry is a thought-provoking subject for any genuine mathematics student. Geometry was initially pursued by the 
Indians and Greeks. That kind of geometry is called pure geometry. Even though pure geometry is very interesting, 
sometimes the proofs needed constructions and also they were cumbersome. At this stage, the concept of studying 
geometry by using algebra was introduced by Rene Descartes (15961650 AD). Thus, the modern analytic geometry 
emerged and is called “Cartesian geometry” named after Rene Descartes. In the following section, we discuss the 
rectangular Cartesian coordinates.

HHH
 (readers please observe the arrowheads in all cases). In vectors AB

1.2.3 Section Formulae
1. Let A and B be two points and P be a point on AB  lying between A and B. Then we say that P divides AB  inter-
nally in the ratio AP:PB (see Fig. 1.2).

2. If P lies on the line AB

 (not in between A and B), then we say that P divides externally the segment AB and we 
write the ratio as –(AP):PB or AP:–PB. The minus sign indicates external division.

1.2.5 Some Points and Circles Associated with a Triangle
In this section, we will discuss some important terms associated with a triangle. The vertices of the triangle would be 
considered as A, B, C. 
Centroid
The point of concurrence of the medians of a triangle is called the centroid of the triangle and is denoted by G. The 
coordinates of the centroid of the triangle with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) are

Note that centroid trisects each median.
Incentre
The internal bisectors of the angles of a triangle are concurrent. This point is called the incentre of the triangle and is 
denoted by I. The incentre is equidistant from three sides and this equal distance r is called the inradius of the triangle. 
If a circle is drawn with centre at I and radius r, then this circle touches the sides of the triangle internally. (For more 
details, see Chapter 4, Vol. 2.)
Incentre formulae
Let A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2) and C(x3, y3) be the vertices of a triangle and BC  a, CA  b and AB  c. Thus, the incentre is

Excentre
The point where the external bisectors of two angles and the internal bisector of one angle are concurrent is called the 
excentre. Thus, there are three excentres, namely, excentre opposite to the vertex A (denoted by I1), excentre opposite 
to the vertex B (denoted by I2) and excentre opposite to the vertex C (denote by I3). Also

Note: For inradius and three exradii, see Chapter 4, Vol. 2.
Circumcentre, Circumradius and Circumcircle
The point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle are concurrent is called the circumcentre of 
the triangle. It is equidistant from the vertices of the triangle. This equal distance is denoted by R and is called the 
circumradius. Thus, if a circle is drawn with the circumcentre as centre and circumradius R as radius, then that circle 
will pass through the vertices of the triangle. Such a circle is called the circumcircle of the triangle.
Orthocentre
The point of concurrence of the three altitudes of a triangle is called the orthocentre of the triangle.
Note: The circumcentre and orthocentre lie inside the triangle if the triangle is acute.

Chapter 1   Rectangular Coordinates, Basic Formulae, Locus and Change of Axes
Nine-Point Circle and Nine-Point Centre
In a triangle, the feet of the altitudes, the midpoints of the three sides and the midpoints of the segments joining the 
orthocentre and the vertices are concyclic. Such a circle is called the nine-point circle and its centre is called the nine-
point centre of the triangle. Also the nine-point centre N is the midpoint of the segment joining the circumcentre and 
the orthocentre. The radius of the nine-point circle is half of the circumradius of the triangle because if $DEF is the 
pedal triangle of $ABC, then the angles of $DEF are 180o  2A, 180o  2B and 180o  2C and the sides are a cos A, 
b cos B and c cos C (see Theorem 4.23, page 223, Chapter 4, Vol. 2). If we use sine rule to $DEF, then we obtain that 
R/2 is the circumradius of $DEF which is the radius of the nine-point circle.
 QUICK LOOK 5
Nine-point circle of $ABC is the circumcircle of the pedal triangle of $ABC as well as the circle passing through 
the midpoints of the sides.
IMPORTANT NOTE
In a triangle ABC,
1. The circumcentre, the centroid, the nine-point cen-
tre and the orthocentre are collinear in the given or-
der (see Definition 4.7, page 228, Chapter 4, Vol. 2).
2. The centroid G divides the segment joining the cir-
cumcentre and orthocentre in the ratio 1:2.
3. The nine-point centre is the midpoint of the segment 
joining the circumcentre and the orthocentre.
Pedal Line (or Simson’s Line)
THEOREM 1.1
The feet of the perpendiculars drawn from a point on the circumcircle of a triangle onto its sides 
are collinear. This line is called Pedal line or Simson’s line of the triangle. The converse of this theo-
rem is also true. That is, if from any point in the plane of a triangle, the feet of the perpendiculars 
onto the sides are collinear, then the point lies on the circumcircle.
We can prove these two results by using plane geometry or what is called pure geometry. The 
line LMN is the Pedal line (see Fig. 1.3).

1.3 Locus
In pure geometry, using congruent triangles property, it was proved that all the points on a line bisecting perpendicu-
larly the segment joining two given points are equidistant from the two given points and this line is called the perpen-
dicular bisector of the segment joining the two points. Of course, any point which is equidistant from these two given 
points lies on this line. Thus, describing a set of points satisfying a certain geometrical condition(s) is difficult in pure

geometry. That is why mathematicians introduced analytical geometry (a combination of algebra and pure geometry) 
and described the locus by algebraic equations. In this section, we introduce the concept of locus, equation of a locus 
and few examples.
DEFINITION 1.2  Locus Let P be a geometrical condition(s) and S be the set of all points in the plane which 
satisfy P. Then S is called a locus.
 QUICK LOOK 6
S is the locus of a geometrical condition(s) P   every point of S satisfies the condition P and every point  
satisfying P belongs to S.
DEFINITION 1.3 
 Equation of the Locus Let S be a locus and f(x, y)  0 be an algebraic equation in x and y. If 
every point P(x, y) belonging to S satisfies the equation f(x, y)  0 and any point in the plane 
satisfying the equation f(x, y)  0 belongs to S, then f(x, y)  0 is called the equation of the 
locus S.
Here afterwards, we will describe a locus by its algebraic equation.
1.4 Change of Axes
In analytical plane, selection of the rectangular coordinate axes is arbitrary. When the axes change, the coordinates of 
the point also change. The study of the relations between the original coordinates and the changed coordinates is 
called change of axes. This change of axes is sometimes necessary to make the equation of a curve as simple as possible 
to prove certain properties. Not that the same properties could not be proved otherwise, but the working out of the 
proof would be more complicated. It is by experience that the student will learn the best method for change of axes. 
In the following, we discuss three types of change of axes. We begin with shifting of the origin.

then show that the coordinates of D are (x1  x3 – x2, 
y1 + y3 – y2).
Solution: Suppose the coordinates of D are (x, y). See 
Fig. 1.7. It is known that in a parallelogram the diagonals 
bisect each other. Hence, AC and BD bisect each other. 
That is, AC and BD have the same point as their mid-

14. An integral point means that both coordinates of 
the point are integers. The number of integral points 
exactly in the interior of the triangle with vertices  
(0, 0), (0, 21) and (21, 0) (see Fig. 1.8) is
(A)  133   (B)  190   (C)  233   (D)  105
Solution: The integral points must be on the vertical 
lines x  1, 2, 3, …, 20. The number of integral points on 
x  1 inside the triangle are (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), …, (1, 19) 
(total number is 19). Similarly, the number of points on  
x  2 is 18, on x  3 is 17, etc. Finally, the number of points 
on x  19 is 1 and on x  20 is 0.
Therefore, the total number of integral points inside

cumcentre is S(3, 4) and centroid G(6, 8). Then, the 
triangle
(A) is right angled
(B) must be equilateral 
(C) must be right-angled isosceles
(D) is isosceles

15
Solution: Clearly S(3, 4) is the midpoint of OG  (see 
Fig. 1.9). Hence OG is the median through as well as the 
perpendicular bisector of the side opposite to the vertex 
O. Hence the triangle is isosceles.

1.8 Nine-point centre: In any triangle, the midpoints 
of the sides, the feet of the altitudes and the 
midpoints of the segments joining the vertices with 
the orthocentre are concyclic. This circle is called 
the nine-point circle whose centre is known as the 
nine-point centre which is denoted by N.
 1.9 In any triangle, the circumcentre S, the centroid 
G, the nine-point centre N and the orthocentre H 
are collinear in the given order (that is, SGNH). 
Further, G divides SH  in the ratio 1:2 and N is 
the midpoint of SH. Further, the radius of the 
nine-point circle is half of the circumradius of the 
triangle.
1.9* Pedal line: Let ABC be a triangle and P be a point 
on the circumcircle of the triangle other than the 
vertices. Then the feet of the perpendiculars drawn 
from P on to the sides of the triangle are collinear. 
This line is called the Pedal line of the point P or 
Simson’s line. 
1.10 If A(x1, y1), B(x2, y2) and C(x3, y3) are three 
consecutive vertices of a parallelogram ABCD, 
then the fourth vertex D is given by (x1  x3 – x2, 
y1  y3 – y2).
1.11 Locus: Let P be a geometrical condition(s) and S 
be the set of all points in the plane which satisfy P. 
Then S is called a locus.
1.12 Equation of the locus: Let S be a locus and  
f(x, y)  0 be an algebraic equation in x and y. 
If every point (x, y) belonging to S satisfies the 
equation f(x, y)  0, and any point in the plane 
satisfying the equation f(x, y)  0 belongs to S, then 
f(x, y)  0 is called the equation of the locus S. The 
locus is generally given by its equation.
1.13 Shifting of origin without changing the direction of 
the axes: Suppose the origin O (0, 0) is shifted to the 
point 
a
O h k
( ,
). Let the old and the new coordinates 
of a point be (x, y) and (X, Y), respectively. Then x 
 X  h and y  Y  k give the relations between the 
old and the new coordinates.

atleast one of a, h, b is not zero, then the equa-
tion ax2  2hxy  by2  2gx  2fy  c  0 is called 
second degree general equation in x and y.
1.16 In the second degree general equation, ax2, 2hxy,

Chapter 2   Straight Line and Pair of Lines  
In this chapter, we discuss various types (forms) of equations of a straight line, angle between two lines, conditions for 
two lines to be parallel and perpendicular, sides of straight lines, concurrency  of lines, etc. ‘Subjective Problems’ sec-
tion provides subjective worked-out problems for the preceding sections. Students are advised to solve each and every 
problem to grasp the topics.
2.1 Straight Line
When areas of coordinates are selected, any line parallel to x-axis (including x-axis) is called a horizontal line and any 
line perpendicular to x-axis is called a vertical line. First, we discuss the concept of an ‘slope of a non-vertical line’.
DEFINITION 2.1  Slope If a non-vertical line l makes an angle P  with the positive direction of the x-axis (that is 
measured in counterclock sense), then the value of tanP  is called the slope of line l. Generally, 
slope of a line is denoted by m. 
Note: Slope is defined for non-vertical lines only. We do not talk about the slope of a vertical line. 
 QUICK LOOK 1
1. Since the angle made by a horizontal line with  
x-axis is 0 or O, its slope is always zero.
2. Two non-vertical parallel lines make the same angles 
with the x-axis implies that their slopes are equal; 
however, if the slopes of two lines are equal, then 
the lines are parallel lines. 
3. The slope of a line is positive  the line makes acute 
angle with the positive direction of the x-axis. 
4. The slope of line is negative  the line makes ob-
tuse angle with the positive direction of the x-axis.

DEFINITION 2.2 
 Intercepts of a Line Suppose a line meets x-axis in the point (a, 0) and y-axis in the point 
(0, b). Then a is called x-intercept of the line and b is called the y-intercept of the line. 
 QUICK LOOK 2
1. A vertical line has x-intercept only.
2. A horizontal line has y-intercept only. 
3. For a line through origin, both intercepts are zero.

THEOREM 2.8
Every first-degree equation in x and y represents a straight line and conversely, the equation of a 
straight line is a first-degree equation in x and y.
PROOF
Suppose ax  by  c  0 is a first-degree equation so that either a or b is non-zero. Now, either b  0 
or b x 0. If b  0, then the equation reduces to ax  c  0 where a x 0 which represents the vertical line 
x  −c/a. If b x 0, then the equation can be written as y  (−a/b)x  (−c/b) which represents straight 
line having slope (−a/b) and y-intercept −c/b. In any case, ax  by  c  0 represents a straight line.
Conversely, let L be a straight line in the coordinate plane. Therefore, L is either a vertical line 
or a non-vertical line. Suppose L is a vertical line meeting x-axis at the point (a, 0), the equation 
of L is x−a  0 which is a first-degree equation in x and y. If L is non-vertical, then it meets y-axis 
at some point, say (0, c), and has slope, say, m, then the equation of L is y  mx  c (see Theorem 
2.3) which is a first-degree equation as coefficient of y is −1 (x 0). 
In view of Theorem 2.8, the following definition is provided.
DEFINITION 2.4  General Equation of a Straight Line First-degree equation in x and y is called the general 
equation of a straight line. Suppose ax  by  c  0 is a first-degree equation, then we have the 
following conditions:
1. If c  0, then the line passes through (0, 0).
2. If b x 0, then the first-degree equation represents a line having slope (−a/b) and y-intercept (−c/b).
3. If b  0, ax  by  c  0 represents a vertical line.
4. If abc x 0, then the first-degree equation represents a line with x-intercept (−c/a) and y-intercept (−c/b).
THEOREM 2.9
Two first-degree equations a1x  b1y  c1  0 and a2x  b2y  c2  0 represent parallel lines if and 
only if a1b2  a2b1 (i.e., a1:b1  a2:b2).

31
 2.1    Straight Line 
PROOF
When two lines are parallel, both are either vertical or non-vertical. If both are vertical, then b1  
b2  0 [by point (3) below Definition 2.4] so that a1b2  a2b1  0. If both are non-vertical, their 
slopes are equal [by point (2) below Definition 2.4]. Thus, 

 
a

Hence, 
a1b2  a2b1or a1:b1  a2:b2

1. Equation of any line parallel to the line ax  by  
c  0 is of the form ax  by  ca 0.
2. In particular, equation of the line passing through 
the point (x1, y1) and parallel to the line ax  by  
c  0 is a(x−x1)  b(y−y1)  0.
THEOREM 2.10
Two first-degree equations a1x  b1y  c1  0 and a2x  b2y  c2  0 represent the same straight line 
if and only if a1:b1:c1  a2:b2:c2.
PROOF
Suppose the two equations represent the same straight line. Since every line is parallel to itself, by 
Theorem 2.9,  a1b2  a2b1 and hence a1:b1  a2:b2. If b1  0, then b2 0 so that a1 and a2 are non-zero.

passing through the origin. The side of the region in which the origin lies is called the origin 
side of the line and the other is called the non-origin side of the line L (see Fig. 2.12).

THEOREM 2.18
Let L y ax  by  c  0 be a line which is not passing through the origin. Then a point A(x1, y1) 
(not on the line L  0) lies
(a) on the non-origin side of L  0  c and L11 are of opposite signs
(b) A(x1, y1) lies on the origin side of L  0  c and L11 have the same sign
PROOF
In Quick Look 9, take B  (x2, y2)  (0, 0). Hence, points A and B (which is equal to the origin) 
lie on the opposite sides of L  0 so that L11 and L22  c have the opposite signs and points A and 
(0, 0) are on the same side. Hence, L11 and L22  c have the same sign.

Let ax  by  c  0 be a line and c x 0.
1. If c  0, then for all points on the origin side L11  0 
and for all points on the non-origin side L11  0.
2. If c  0, then for all points on the origin side L11 0 
and L11  0 for all points on the non-origin side.
 Example    2.16
Check whether the point (2, 1) lies on the origin side or 
non-origin side of the line 2x − 3y 1  0.
Solution: We have Ly 2x − 3y 1, A(x1, y1)  (2, 1) and 
c  1. That is,
L11  2(2) − 3(1)  1  2
and 
c  1 
That is, L11 and c have the same origin. Hence, (2,1) lies 
on the origin side of L  0.
 Example    2.17
Find the ratio in which the line L y x  2y − 3  0 divides 
the line joining the points A(1, 2) and B(3, 2).
Solution: A(1, 2)  (x1, y1) and B(3, 2)  (x2, y2) so that 
L11  1  2(2) − 3  2
and 
L22  3  2(2) − 3  4 
Therefore, L  0 divides AB  in the ratio
−L11:L22  −2:4  −1:2
That is, L  0 divides AB externally in the ratio 1:2.
THEOREM 2.19
Suppose U1 y a1x  b1y  c1  0 and U2 y a2x  b2y  c2  0 are two parallel lines. Then for any real

From Quick Look 5, U2  0 can be written as U2 y a1x  b1y  c1a  0. Therefore,
K1U1  K2U2 y (K1  K2) [a1x  b1y]  K1c1  K2c1a  0
which represents the line parallel to U1 y a1x  b1y c1  0.
THEOREM 2.20

which is a contradiction of the hypothesis a1b2 x a2b1. Therefore, K1U1  K2U2  0 is a first-degree

Note:  If U1  0 and U2  0 are two intersecting lines, then K1U1  K2U2  0, where eitherK1 or K2 is non-zero, represents 
all the lines passing through their point of intersection including U1  0 and U2  0. If K1 x 0, then the equation can be 
written as U1  (K2/K1) U2  0 which is of the form U1  KU2  0, where K is K2/K1. The equation U1  KU2  0 represents 
all lines passing through the intersection of U1  0 and U2  0 including U1  0, but excluding U2  0. Hence, for all 
practical purposes, we consider the equation U1  KU2  0, where K is a real parameter in solving the problems.
 QUICK LOOK 11
Suppose U1  0 and U2  0 are two lines, then
1. If U1  0 and U2  0 are parallel lines, then U1  KU2 
 0 represents a line parallel to each of U1  0 and 
U2  0. 
2. If U1  0 and U2  0 are intersecting lines, then U1  
KU2  0 represents a line passing through the inter-
section of U1  0 and U2  0.
THEOREM 2.21
If U1  0 and U2  0 are two intersecting lines, then every line in the plane of U1  0 and U2  0 is 
of the form K1U1  K2U2  K3  0.
PROOF
Let U  0 be a line in the plane of U1  0 and U2  0. Therefore, either U  0 passes through the 
intersection of U1  0 and U2  0 or it does not. In the former case, U  0 must be of the form K1U1 
 K2U2  0 for some real K1and K2, such that L

not pass through the intersection of U1  0 and U2  0. Hence, there is one and only one line L in 
the plane passing through the intersection of U1  0 and U2  0 and parallel to the line L. Hence, 
by Theorem 2.20, the equation of L must be of the form K1U1  K2U2  0. Since L is parallel to U 
 0, then U  0 is of the form K1U1  K2U2  K3  0 for some real constant K3. Thus, the theorem is 
proved.

both the origin and P are on the same sides for both L1 and L2 or lie on opposite sides for both

Find the angle bisectors of the angle between the lines

DEFINITION 2.7 
 Let a, h, b, g, f and c be real numbers and atleast one of the real numbers a, h and b be non-zero. 
Then, the expression ax2  2hxy  by2 is called second-degree homogeneous expression and ax2   
2hxy  by2  2gx  2fy  c is called second-degree general expression in x and y. At the same 
time, ax2  2hxy  by2  0 is called second-degree homogeneous equation and ax2  2hxy   
by2  2gx  2fy  c  0 is called second-degree general equation.

Chapter 2   Straight Line and Pair of Lines  
THEOREM 2.27
If h2 r ab, then the locus represented by the equation ax2  2hxy  by2  0 is a pair of lines passing 
through the origin.

Since a is real, either a  0 or a x 0.
Case 1: a  0. In this case, the given equation becomes
 
y

(2.12)
Since a  0, atleast one of the values of h and b is not zero so that 2hx  by  0 is a first-degree 
equation and hence it represents a straight line. Also, y  0 represents x-axis. Hence, Eq. (2.12) 
represents pair of lines, namely, y  0 (i.e., x-axis) and the line 2hx  by  0.
Case 2: a x 0. In this case, the equation is written as

To find the lines represented by the second-degree 
homogeneous equation ax2  2hxy  by2  0, factorise 
the expression ax2  2hxy  by2 into two linear factors 
so that the corresponding linear equations are the 
required equations.
 Example    2.22
Find the lines represented by the equation x2− 5xy  
6y2  0.
Solution: We have a  1, h  −5/2 and b  6. Also h2  
25/4  6  ab. Therefore, x2− 5xy  6y2  0 represents a 
pair of lines passing through origin. Further,
x2− 5xy  6y2 y (x− 2y)(x− 3y) 
 The lines are x − 2y  0 and x − 3y  0

THEOREM 2.29
Suppose ax2  2hxy  by2  0 represents a pair of lines and (x1, y1) is a point in the plane. Then,
1. The equation of the pair of lines passing through (x1, y1) and parallel to these lines is a(x−x1)2  
2h(x−x1) (y−y1)  b(y−y1)2  0.
2. The equation of the pair of lines passing through (x1, y1) and perpendicular to the given lines 
is b(x−x1)2− 2h(x−x1) (y−y1)  a(y−y1)2  0.
PROOF
Suppose the lines represented by ax2  2hxy  by2  0 are l1x  m1y  0 and l2x  m2y  0. Hence, 
from Theorem 2.27, Note (1), l1l2  a, l1m2  l2m1  2h and m1m2  b.
1. From Quick Look 5, part (2), the equations of the lines through (x1, y1) and parallel to the lines 
l1x  m1y  0 and l2x  m2y  0 are l1 (x − x1)  m1 (y − y1)  0 and l2 (x − x1)  m2 (y − y1)  0. 
Hence, their combined equation is

the lines are m1 (x − x1) −l1 (y − y1)  0 and m2 (x − x1) −l2 (y − y1)  0. Hence, their combined

Solution: The lines represented by x2 − 5xy  6y2  0 are 
x − 2y  0 and x − 3y  0. Therefore, from Theorem 2.29, 
we get the following:

of coincidental lines so that in this case, S  ax2  
2hxy  by2  2gx  2fy  c  0 represents a pair of 
parallel lines.
2. If S y ax2  2hxy  by2  2gx  2fy  c  0 represents 
a pair of distinct intersecting lines, this pair together 
with the pair represented by ax2  2hxy  by2  0 form 
a parallelogram with the origin as one of the vertices.

2.2.1  Procedure to Find the Lines Represented by the Second-Degree General Equation 
S y ax2  2hxy  by2  2gx  2fy  c  0
Step 1: Factorise the homogeneous part ax2  2hxy  by2 and suppose

Step 2: S y (l1x  m1y  n1)(l2x  m2y  n2)
Step 3:  Equate the corresponding coefficients of x and y and also the constant terms on both sides and solve 
for n1 and n2.
Theorem 2.33 is the last result which is very useful in solving some locus problems. This theorem is called homogenis-
ing the second-degree curve equation with a straight line equation.

PROOF
Clearly the coordinates of both points A and B satisfy the line equation lx  my  1 as well as  
S  0 and hence points A and B satisfy Sa  0. Also (0, 0) satisfies Sa  0. That is, Sa  0 passes through 
A, B and origin (see Fig. 2.16). On simplification, we can see that Sa  0 is a homogeneous equation 
of second degree representing pair of lines, which are nothing but the linesOA

Solution: See Fig. 2.60. The line 4x  2y  9 has positive 
interception coordinates while the line 2x  y  6  0 has 
negative interception on the axes. Hence, origin O lies in

Therefore, the sides of the parallelogram are

(B) 32 
(C) 42

Solution: See Fig. 2.63. Let M be the midpoint of AB 
so that M  (1, 4). Clearly, A and B do not lie on the 
diameter 4y − x − 7  0. If O is the centre of the circle, 
then we know that

(B) both S1 and S2 are false
(C) S1 is true while S2 is false
(D) S2 is true while S1 is before

35. The straight line 2x  3y  1  0 bisects the angle be-
tween two straight lines of which one line is 3x  2y  
4  0. Then, the equation of the other line is
(A) 9x  26y  48 
(B) 9x  46y  28
(C) 9x  26y  28 
(D) 3x  26y  48
Solution: See Fig. 2.65. Let L1 y 3x  2y  4  0, L y 2x  
3y  1  0 and L2 y 0 be the required lines. Since the line 
L2  0 passes through the intersection of the lines L1 0 
and L  0, L2  0 is of the form (by Theorem 2.20)
 
L2 y (3x  2y  4)  K(2x  2y  1)  0 
Suppose (@, A ) (x the intersection of L1  0 and L  0) is 
a point on the line L  0 so that
 
2@  3A  1  0 
(2.85)
But L  0 is an angular bisection of L1  0 and L2  0 
which implies that

39. The point (2, 1) is shifted through a distance 3 2  
units measured parallel to the line x  y  1 in the 
decreasing direction of ordinates to reach a point B. 
The image of the point B in the line x  y  1 is
(A) (0, 0) 
(B) (0, 1)
(C) (3, 2) 
(D) (3, 4)
Solution: See Fig. 2.67.  Let A  (2, 1). By hypothesis, A 
is translated along the line
y − 1  −1(x − 2)
 
 x  y  3 
(2.87)
Therefore abscissa of B is given by the equation
(2  x)2  (2  x)2  18

Hence, the point B  (1, 4) or (5, 2). However, A(2, 
1) is translated in the decreasing sense of ordinates. 
Thus, B  (5, 2). Hence, the image of B(5, 2) in the 
line x  5  1 is Ba(3, 4) because the slope of BBa is 1 
and the midpoint of BBa is (4, 3) which lies on the line

41. Let A(5, 12), B(13cosP, 13sinP ) and C(13sinP, 
13cosP ) where P is real be the vertices of $ABC. 
Then, the orthocentre of $ABC lies on the line
(A) x  y  7  0 
(B) x  y  7  0
(C) x  y  7  0 
(D) x  y  7  0
Solution: Observe that B and C are images of each 
other on the line y  x and hence the side BC varies and 
is perpendicular to the line y  x. Hence, the orthocentre 
lies on the altitude through A(5, 12) and parallel to the 
line y  x, whose equation is

42. Consider the following two families of lines repre-
sented by the equations (x  y  6)  K(2x  y  3)  0 
and (x  2y  4)  L(3x  2y  4)  0. If these families 
of lines are at right angles to each other, then their 
points of intersection lie on the curve
(A) x2    y2    3x    4y    3    0
(B) x2    y2    5x    2y    3    0
(C) x2    y2    3x    4y    3    0
(D) x2   y2   3x    4y    3    0
Solution: By Theorem 2.20, the equation (x − y − 6)  K(2x  y − 3)  0 represents the family of lines passing 
through the intersection of the lines x − y− 6  0 and 2x  y − 6  0 which is (3, −3). Similarly, the second equation 
represents a family of concurrent lines which is concur-
rent at the point of intersection of the lines x  2y −4  
0 and 3x − 2y − 4  0 which is (2, 1). Suppose the line 
through the point (3, −3) is

SUMMARY
2.1. Slope of line: Let l be a non-vertical line (i.e., l is not 
parallel to y-axis) making an angle P with the posi-
tive direction of x-axis. Then, tan P is called the slope 
of the line l. Generally, the slope of a line is denoted 
by m.
Caution: The concept of slope is followed only for 
non-vertical lines.
Note: Slope of a horizontal line (which is parallel to 
x-axis) is always zero.
2.2. If A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) are two points on a non-
vertical line, then the slope of the line AB
F E
HHH
 is y

2.3. Intercepts on the axes: If a line l meets x-axis at 
(a, 0) and y-axis at (0, b), then a is called x-intercept 
and b is called y-intercept of the line l.
2.4. Equations of the axis: The equation of x-axis is y  0 
and the equation of y-axis is x  0.
2.5. Various forms of straight line equations:
1. Two-point form: Equation of the line passing 
through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is
(x – x1) (y1 – y2)  (y – y1) (x1 – x2)
2. Point–slope form: Equation of the line which is 
having slope m and passing through the point 
(x1, y1) is
y – y1  m(x – x1)
3. Symmetric form: If a non-vertical makes an angle 
P with the positive direction of x-axis and passes 
through a point (x1, y1), then its equation is

Note: In the above relation, if we consider that 
each ratio is equal to r (real number), then every 
point on the line is of the form (x1  rcosP, y1 
rsinP). Also r  gives the distance of the point (x, y) 
on the given line from the fixed point (x1, y1).
4. Intercept form: If a and b are x and y intercepts of a 
line (ab x 0), then the line equation is x

Note: Area of the triangle formed by the coordi-
nate axis and the line x

5. Slope–intercept form: The equation of a non-
vertical line which is having slope m and 
y-intercept c is
y  mx  c
Note: Equation of any line (except the y-axis) 
passing through origin is the form y  mx.
6. Normal form: Let l be a line whose distance from 
the origin is ON ( p) and ON  make an angle @
with the positive direction of the x-axis. Then, the 
equation of the line l is x cos @  y sin @   p.
2.6. Definition (first-degree equation): If a, b and c are 
real and either a or b is not zero, then ax  by  c is 
called first-degree expression in x and y and ax  by 
c  0 is called first-degree equation in x and y.
2.7. Theorem: Every first-degree equation in x and y rep-
resents a straight line and the equation of any line in 
the coordinate plane is a first-degree equation in x
and y.
2.8. General equation of a straight line: First-degree 
equation in x and y is called the general equation of 
a straight line.

 the 
equation K1u1  K2u2  0 represents the lines 
passing through the intersection of u1  0 and u2 
 0. Conversely, the equation of any line passing 
through the intersection of u1  0 and u2  0 is K1u1 
 K2u2  0 for some K1 and K2.
Note: Instead of K1u1  K2u2  0, we consider the 
equation u1  Ku2  0 which is practically more 
useful.
2.26. Corollary: Suppose u1  0 and u2  0 are the two

Chapter 3   Circle
In the previous chapter, we discussed about the straight line and pair of lines. It is known that a straight line is repre-
sented by first-degree equation in x and y and hence it is called first-degree curve. Curves represented by second-
degree equation in x and y are called second-degree curves. Some of the second-degree curves are pair of lines (studied 
in the previous chapter), circle and conics. Among these second-degree curves, the circle has been known since ancient 
times and has some special properties. In this chapter, we study the general equation of a circle, equation of the tangent 
at a point, chord equation interval of its midpoint, chord of contact, orthogonal circles, etc. Subjective Problems have 
been provided for the preceding sections. Students are advised to solve each and every problem to grasp the topics.
3.1 Introduction
We begin with the following definition.
DEFINITION 3.1 Circle Let A be a fixed point in a plane and r  0 a given real number. Then the locus of the point 
P such that the distance AP is equal to r is called a circle with centre A and radius r (Fig. 3.1).

1. Equation of the circle with centre at origin and ra-
dius r is x2  y2  r2.
2. Equation of the circle with centre at (h, k) and ra-
dius r is x2  y2 − 2hx − 2ky  h2  k2 − r2  0, which 
is in the form x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0, where g, f

 3.1    Introduction 
Note:
1. The locus represented by the equation (x − h)2  (y − k)2  0 is the single point (h, k) which is called point circle. In 
fact, if the radius of a circle is zero, then it is called point circle.
2. If g2  f 2 – c  0, then the locus represented by x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0 is the empty set and it represents point 
circle if g2  f 2 – c  0. Further, the equation of the circle with centre (h, k) and radius r is of the form x2  y2 
2gx  2fy  c  0 (see Quick Look 1). With this understanding we refer the equation x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0 
as the general equation of a circle. Usually, when g2  f 2 – c  0, then we call the circle as imaginary circle.
3. If a ≠ 0, then the equation ax2  ay2  2gx  2fy  c  0 can be written as x2  y2  2gax  2f ay  ca  0, where ga  g/a, f a 
f/a, ca  c/a which represents circle in the broad perspective as per point (2). The equation ax2  ay2  2gx  2fy  c  0 
is called universal equation of the circle.
4. The second degree general equation S y ax2  2hxy  by2  2gx  2fy  c  0 represents a circle with positive radius 
if and only if a  b  0 and g2  f 2  ac. The proof is not necessary.
THEOREM 3.3
If A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) are extremities of a diameter of a circle, then the equation of the circle is 
(x − x1)(x − x2)  (y − y1)(y − y2)  0.
PROOF
Consider Fig. 3.2. Let P be any point on the circle whose coordinates are (x, y). It is clear that both 
the points A and B satisfy the equation
 
(x − x1)(x − x2)  (y − y1)(y − y2)  0 
(3.1)
A(x1

FIGURE 3.2
Hence, we may assume P is not both A and B. From the elementary plane geometry, it is known that 
angle in a semicircle is a right angle. Therefore,  APB  is a right angle. That is, the segments AP  and 
BP  are at right angle to each other so that the product of their slopes is equal to −1. Therefore

Hence 
(x − x1)(x − x2)  (y − y1)(y − y2)  0
That is, every point on the given circle satisfies Eq. (3.1) and conversely, if any point Q(x, y) satisfies 
Eq. (3.1), then we know that AQ and BQ are at right angles and hence Q must lie on the circle. 
Hence, Eq. (3.1) represents the circle for which A(x1, y1) and B(x2, y2) are ends of a diameter.
THEOREM 3.4 
If P(x, y) is a point on the circle x2  y2  r2, then there exists P  such that x  r cos P  and y  
r sin P and conversely the point (r cos P, r sin P ) lies on the circle x2  y2  r2 for all P.  The 
equations x  r cos P, y  r sin P  are called parametric equations of the circle x2  y2  r2.
PROOF
Let P(x, y) be a point on the circle x2  y2  r2
 (see Fig. 3.3). Draw PM perpendicular to the x-axis 
and let MOP   P. From ΔMOP, we have that 
cos P  x

Therefore,  x  r cos P, y  r sin P. Also

Note:
1. By shifting the origin to the centre (h, k) of the circle (x − h)2  (y − k)2  r2 and using Theorem 3.4 we can see 
that
 x  h  r cos P 
and 
y  k  r sin P 
are the parametric equations of the circle (x − h)2  (y − k)2  r2.
2. Since (−g, −f ) and r

are its parametric equations.

THEOREM 3.6
If S  0 is a circle and (x1, y1) is a point in the plane of the circle (not the centre), then the equation 
S1  0 represents a straight line which is perpendicular to the line joining the centre and the point 
(x1, y1).

Since (x1, y1) ≠ (−g, −f ), it follows that
S1 y (g  x1)x  (f  y1)y  gx1  fy1 + c  0 
is a first-degree equation in x and y and hence it represents a straight line. Also, since the slope of 
the line S1  0 is −(g  x1)/(f  y1), it follows that it is perpendicular to the line joining (−g, −f ) and 
(x1, y1).
THEOREM 3.7
The equation of the chord joining two points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) on a circle S  0 is S1 
S2  S12 and hence the equation of the tangent at (x1, y1) is S1  0.
PROOF
Let S y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0. Since P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) lie on the circle (see Fig. 3.6),  we have

Solution: We have
22  32 − 2(2) − 4(3)  3  16 − 16  0 
which implies that (2, 3) lies on the circle S  x2  y2 −

equal to

DEFINITION 3.2 Director Circle The locus of the point through which perpendicular tangents are drawn to a

DEFINITION 3.3 Chord of Contact Let C be a circle and P be an external point to C. Let A and B be the points 
of contact of the tangents drawn from P to C. Then the chord AB  is called the chord of con-
tact of the point P with respect to the circle C.
THEOREM 3.12
The equation of the chord of contact of a point P(x1, y1) with respect to the circle S  0 is S1  0.
PROOF
Let AB  be the chord of contact of P (see Fig. 3.10). Suppose A  (x2, y2) and B  (x3, y3). The 
equation of the tangent at A(x2, y2) is S2  0. 
This tangent passes through

 Therefore, the point A(x2, y2) satisfies 
the first-degree equation S1  0. Similarly, S13  0 implies that the point B(x3, y3) satisfies the first-
degree equation S1  0. Hence, the equation of the chord AB  is S1  0.

equation x2  2gx  c  0 (since the x-axis equation is y  0).

the values of g, f and c.
5. Find the equation of a circle with the centre at point

Solution: Let A be (6, 1). Since the line 5x  12y − 3  0 
touches the circle (say, at M as shown in Fig. 3.15), the 
distance of the line from the centre is equal to the radius.

Solution: Let S y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0 be the 
required circle. Since its centre (−g, −f ) lies on the line 
x  2y, we have
 
g − 2f  0

The circle passes through the points P(−1, 2) and

Solution: Let P(x1, y1) be a point on the line 2x  y −

2x1  y1 − 4  0 
(3.9)
By Theorem 3.12, the equation of the chord of contact of

S1 y xx1  yy1 − 1  0

of y1 in Eq. (3.10), we have

the centre of the circle is its director circle.
Solution: P is a point and AB its chord of contact with 
respect to a circle with centre C (see Fig. 3.20) such that  
BCA   90°. Since CA and CB are at right angles to the 
tangents PA and PB, respectively. It follows that APB  
is a right-angled triangle. Hence, point P lies on the di-
rector circle of the given circle.

20. Show that the circle x2  y2  4x − 4y  4  0 touches 
both axes and find the points of contact.
Solution: The centre is (−2, 2) and the radius is 2. The 
distance of the centre (−2, 2) from the coordinate axes is 
equal to 2. Hence, the circle touches both coordinate axes, 
and the points of contact are given by (−2, 0) and (0, 2).
21. Find the equations of the circle touching both axes 
and passing through the point (2, 1).
Solution: Since the circle touches both axes and passes 
through the point (2, 1), the centre of the circle must be 
in the first quadrant. Hence, its equation should be of the 
form x2  y2 − 2ax − 2ay  a2  0. It passes through the

0 is the required circle. Let P(x1, y1) be a point on the 
circle S  0 at which the tangent to the circle is parallel to 
the line joining origin to the centre (2, 3). Therefore, the 
slope of the tangent S1 y xxl  yy1 − 2(x  x1) − 3(y  y1) 
 0 is equal to 3/2 and the slope of the line S1 y (x1 − 2)x

35. ABCD is a square of side 2a units. Taking AB and 
AD as coordinate axes, find the equation of the circle 
which touches all the four sides of the square. If E is 
a point on DC such that 3DE  DC and F is a point 
on BA produced such that FA  AB, prove that EF 
touches the circle and also find the coordinates of 
the point of contact.
Solution: By hypothesis, A is (0, 0), B  (2a, 0), C  (2a, 
2a) and D  (0, 2a). Therefore, O  (a, a) is the centre of 
the circle so that a is its radius (see Fig. 3.26). Hence, the 
equation of the circle is (x − a)2  (y − a)2  a2. Further, 
E divides the segment DC in the ratio 1:2, that is, DE:EC 
 1:2. Therefore,

Solution: We know that y-axis touches the circle x2

in this problem also, we have q2  f 2  c  q2. Therefore,
y-axis touches the circle. Since the tangents drawn from 
the origin are at right angles, the other tangent touches 
the x-axis. Therefore,
p2  q2  (see Quick Look 6 and Problem 1)
Aliter: Since the tangents drawn from (0, 0) are at right 
angles, origin must lie on the director circle of the given 
circle (see Definition 3.2 and Quick Look 4). Therefore,

42. A is a point on the circle x2  y2  2a2. From A, two 
tangents are drawn to the circle x2  y2  a2 whose 
points of contact are B and C. As A moves on the 
circle x2  y2  2a2, show that the locus of the circum-
centre of $ABC is the circle x2  y2  a2/2.
Solution: According to Quick Look 4, A lies on the di-
rector circle of x2  y2  a2. Hence, BAC   90° (see Fig. 
3.31). Therefore, the circumcentre of $ABC  midpoint 
of BC  midpoint of OA because ABOC is a square, 
where O is (0, 0). If A  (h, k), the circumcentre is (h/2,

Solution: Let S y x2  y2 − a2  0 and Sa y x2  y2 − b2  0. 
By hypothesis, b  a. Suppose that the tangents at points

THEOREM 3.14
If S  0 and Sa  0 are non-concentric circles in the standard form, then the equation S − Sa  0

 Therefore, S − Sa y 2(g − ga)x  2(f − f a)y  c − ca  0 is a first-degree 
equation and hence it represents a straight line. Since the slope of the line joining the centres is 
f − f a/g − ga and the slope of S − Sa  0 is −(g − ga)/f − f a, S − Sa  0 is perpendicular to the line join-
ing the centres.
 QUICK LOOK 8
1. If the circles S  0 and Sa  0 cut in points P and Q, 
then S − Sa  0 passes through both P and Q and 
hence S − Sa  0 is the common chord PQ of the 
circles.
2. If the circles S  0 and Sa  0 touch each other at 
point P, then S − Sa  0 is the common tangent of 
the two circles at point P and P divides the line 
joining the centres in the ratio of their radii.
THEOREM 3.15
Let S y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  ca  0 and L y ax  by  c  0 be a line. Then for all values of K, the 
equation S  KL y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  ca  K(ax  by  c)  0 represents a family of circles.
PROOF
S  KL y x2  y2  (2g  Ka)x  (2f  Kb)y  Kc  ca  0 which represents circle in the sense of the 
Note given under Theorem 3.2.
 QUICK LOOK 9
1. If the line L  0 intersects the circle S  0 in two dif-
ferent points P and Q, then S  KL  0 represents a 
circle passing through points P and Q.
2. If L  0 touches S  0 at point P, then S  KL  0 
represents a circle touching S  0 at point P and L 
0 is the common tangent at point P.
3. If S  0 and Sa  0 are two non-concentric circles 
in the standard form and L y S − Sa  0, then 
S  KL  0 where L y S − Sa  0 represents a circle. 
In particular, if S  0 and Sa  0 intersect, then S 
KL  0 represents a circle passing through their 
points of intersection. Further, if S  0 and Sa  0 
touch each other at point P then S  KL  0 where 
L y S − Sa  0 represents circle touching both S  0 
and Sa  0 at point P.

DEFINITION 3.4 Angle of Intersection  Suppose point P is a common point of two circles C1 and C2. Then the 
angle between the tangents drawn to the circles at point P is called the angle of intersection of 
C1 and C2 (see Chapter 3, Vol. 3).
DEFINITION 3.5 Orthogonal Circles  If the angle of intersection of two circles is a right angle, then the two 
circles are said to intersect orthogonally.
 QUICK LOOK 10
Two circles C1 and C2 with centres A and B, respec-
tively, intersect each other orthogonally at P if and 
only if AP is tangent to C2 and BP is tangent to C1 (see 
Fig. 3.38). That is, if and only if $APB is right-angled 
with right angle at P (see Fig. 3.38)

THEOREM 3.18
Let S  0 be a circle and A(x1, y1) be a point in the plane of the circle. Let L is a line through A
meeting the circle S  0 in P and Q. Then AP·AQ is constant. That is, AP·AQ is independent of the 
line L.

Let S y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0. Suppose the parametric equations of the line L  0 be

Since Eq. (3.35) is a quadratic equation in r, it will have two roots, say, r1 and r2. L  0 meeting the 
circle implies that r1 and r2 are real and AP, AQ are equal to r1 and r2. Therefore, AP·AQ  r1r2  S11, 
which is constant. S11 value depends on A(x1, y1), but not on L  0.
 QUICK LOOK 12
If A(x1, y1) is an external point, then we know that 
S11  0 and 
S11  is the length of the tangent drawn 
from A(x1, y1) (see Theorem 3.11). Hence, A(x1, y1) is 
external point. This implies AP·AQ  S11  Square of 
the tangent from point A.

 3.4    Relation Between Two Circles 
DEFINITION 3.6 Power of a Point   Let S  0 be a circle and A(x1, y1) a point in the plane of the circle. If a line 
L through point A meets the circle at points P and Q, then the power of A with respect to the 
circle is defined as
1. AP·AQ if A is external point.
2. − (AP·AQ) if A is internal point.
3. 0 if A lies on the circle.
 QUICK LOOK 13
According to Theorem 3.18, the power of a point  
A(x1, y1) with respect to the circle S  0 is S11. The 
power is positive or negative or zero when the point 
lies outside or inside or on the circle, respectively.
Examples 
1. The power of the point A(2, 3) with respect to the 
circle S y x2  y2 − 4x − 2y − 6  0 is S11  22  32 − 
4(2) − 2(3) − 6  −7.
2. The power of the point (1, 1) with respect to the circle 
S y x2  y2  4x  2y − 1  0 is S11  12  12  4(1) − 
2(1) − 1  7.
THEOREM 3.19
Let S  0 and Sa  0 be two non-concentric circles. Then, the locus of the point whose powers 
with respect to the two circles are equal is a straight line perpendicular to the line joining the 
centres.
PROOF
Let S y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0 and Sa y x2  y2  2gax  2fay  ca  0 be two non-concentric 
circles [i.e. (−g, −f) x  (−ga, −fa)]. A(x1, y1) is a point on the locus  S11  Sa11. This implies

Note: Since the circles are non-concentric, S − Sa  0 is a first degree equation and hence it is a straight line. Also, one 
can see that the line S − Sa  0 is perpendicular to the line joining the centres.
DEFINITION 3.7 Radical Axis   The locus of the point whose powers with respect to two non-concentric 
circles are equal is a straight line called the radical axis of the two circles.
 QUICK LOOK 14
1. The radical axis of the circles S  0, Sa  0 is S − Sa  0.
2. S − Sa  0 is the common chord if they intersect. 
That is, if the two circles intersect, then their radical 
axis is their common chord.
3. If the two circles touch, then the common target at 
the point of contact is the radical axis.
THEOREM 3.20
The radical axes of three circles (see Fig. 3.40) with non-collinear centres taken two by two are 
concurrent and this point is called the radical centre of the three circles.

PROOF
 Let S  0, Sa  0 and Sq 0 be those circles (in the standard form) with non-collinear centres. Then 
by Theorem 3.19, L1  S − Sa  0, L2  Sa − Sq  0 and L3  Sq − S  0 are the radical axes of the pairs 
(C1, C2), (C2, C3) and (C3, C1), respectively. Now L1  L2  L3  0 implies that the three lines 
L1  0, L2  0, and L3  0 are concurrent (see Theorem 2.14) where C1, C2 and C3 are S  0, Sa  0 
and Sq  0, respectively.
Since the radical centre lies on all the three radical axes, its powers with respect to all the three circles are equal. Hence 
the radical centre lies outside the three circles or lies inside the three circles.
If the radical centre lies outside the circles, then the length of the tangent drawn from it to the circles is same and 
hence if a circle is drawn with the centre at the radical centre and length of the tangent drawn from it to the circles as 
radius, then this circle cuts all the three circles orthogonally.

3.5 Common Tangents of Two Circles
Let C1 and C2 be two non-concentric circles. Suppose A and B are their centres and r1 and r2 are their radii, respectively.
Case 1:  Suppose circles C1 and C2 are such that one circle completely lies outside the other. That is, AB  r1  r2 [see 
Fig. 3.41(a)]. In this case, there are four common tangents. Two are called direct tangents and the other two are 
called transverse tangents. A tangent is called direct common tangent if the centres of the circles lie on the 
same side of the target. Transverse common tangent means that the centres lie on the opposite sides. If the radii 
are different, then the direct common tangents intersect in a point which is called the external centre of simili-
tude denoted by S2. S2 divides externally the line joining the centres in the ratio of their radii. The two trans-
verse common tangents intersect in a point is called the internal centre of similitude denoted by S1. S1 divides 
the line joining the centres internally in the ratio of their radii [see Fig. 3.41(b)].

tangents are direct and one tangent is transverse (see Fig. 3.42).

Solution: The centre A and radius r1 of S  0 are (7, −3)

Though the following theorem is not of much practical usage, we state it without proof.
THEOREM 3.21

If (x1, y1) is an external point to a circle S  0, then the combined equation of the pair of tangents 
drawn from (x1, y1) to the circle is 
S1

Note: If S y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0 is a circle and (x1, y1) lies outside the circle, then the combined equation of the 
pair of tangents is

Therefore, the tangents are given by y  3  (3/4)(x − 3) or

Note: The two tangents from (3, −3) are at right angles 
and hence (3, −3) lies on the director circle of S  0. One 
can check this fact.
2. Find the equations of the tangents drawn from origin 
to the circle S y  x2  y2 − 6x − 2y  8  0.
Solution: S11  8  0  (0, 0) is external point to S  0.

Solution: Let the given circles be C1, C2 and C3, re-

 3.5    Common Tangents of Two Circles 
The two circles touch each other  S − Sa  0 is the common 
tangent at the point of contact. This implies that the dis-

12. Prove that the locus of the midpoint of a system of 
parallel chords of a circle is a diameter of the circle.
Solution: Let S y x2  y2 − a2  0. Let M(x1, y1) be the 
midpoint of a chord parallel to a line lx  my  n  0. Equa-

But this is parallel to lx  my  n  0. This implies lx1 −

which passes through the centre (0, 0).
13. Prove that any two circles with different centres can be 
in the form x2  y2  2ax  c  0 and x2  y2  2bx  c  0, 
c is same for both the equations.
Solution: Let C1 and C2 be two circles with A and B as 
their centres. Take the line AB as x-axis, their radical axis 
as y-axis. Their centres lie on the x-axis. Therefore, we can 
write their equations as

Hence, C  C1. Therefore, the equations of C1 and C2 are 
S y x2  y2  2ax  c  0 and Sa y x2  y2  2bx  c  0.

24. Prove that the equation x2  y2 − 2x − 2ay − 8  0 rep-
resents a family of circles intersecting in two points P 
and Q. Determine a member of this family of circles 
such that tangents drawn to this circle at P and Q 
intersect on the line x  2y  5  0.
Solution: The given equation is (x2  y2 − 2x − 8) − (2a)y 
 0 which is of the form S  L L  0, where S  0 is the circle 
x2  y2 − 2x − 8  0 and L  0 is the line y  0 (x-axis). The line 
y  0 intersects the circle x2  y2 − 2x − 8  0 at two points 
P(−2, 0) and Q(4, 0). Therefore, the given equation rep-
resents a family of circles all passing through P(2, 0) and  
Q(4, 0).
Since the tangents at points P and Q intersect at (x1, y1) 
which lies on the line x  2y  5  0, we get

 y2  − a2  0 from the point P(x1, y1) to touch the

cumcircle of $PQR.
Solution: QR being the chord of contact of P(x1, y1) with 
respect to the circle S  0, its equation is S1 y  xx1  yy1 − a2  0 
Any circle passing through Q and R is of the form S  KL
 0 where S y  x2  y2  − a2  0 and L y  xx1  yy1 − a2  0. 
Therefore,

Solution: We have

If the required circle is to just contain the circle with centre 
(2, 3/2) and radius 5/2, then this circle should touch the 
required circle internally. If r is the radius of the required 
circle the distance between their centres (−3, 3/2) and (2,

Suppose the tangents from point P to the circle x2  y2 
 r2 meet the circle with radius R in A and B such that 
AB touches the circle with centre r. Thus, for $PAB,  
x2  y2  R2 is the circumcircle and x2  y2  r2 is the in-
circle and hence the circumcentre and incentre are the 
same. Therefore, the triangle is equilateral so that R  2r.

19. A circle is given by x2  (y  1)2  1. Another circle 
C touches it externally and also the x-axis. Then the 
locus of its centre is
(A) {(x, y): x2  4y}  {(x, y): y b  0}
(B) {(x, y): x2  (y  1)2  4}  {(x, y): y b  0}
(C) {(x, y): x2  y}  {(0, y): y b  0}
(D) {(x, y): x2  4y}  {(0, y): y b  0}
(IIT-JEE 2005)
Solution: Let P(h, k) be the centre of C so that k  is 
the radius of C because it touches x-axis (see Fig. 3.57). 
Also, since C touches the circle x2  (y  1)2  1 exter-

Solution: The two given circles are of unit radius 
and having centres at (1, 0) and (1, 0), respectively. 
The required circle is also of unit radius. Hence, the 
required circle must touch these two given circles ex-
ternally. Also, the given circles x2  y2  2x  0 and  
x2  y2  2x  0 touch each other externally at origin. 
Hence, the centre of the required circle from the origin 
is

its radius must be the absolute value of the ordinate

Answer: (A)
 (ii)  Suppose L1 is a line parallel to L at a unit distance 
from L such that L1 and the circle C1 are on opposite 
sides to the line L.  Therefore, the centre of the circle 
C is equidistant from the line L1 and the centre of 
the circle C2. Hence, the centre of C is a parabola 
with focus at the centre of C2 and directrix L1.
Answer: (B)

 (ii)  Since PQ makes angle 120° with the positive direc-
tion of the x-axis and QPR 60°, it is clear that PR 
is parallel to the x-axis (see Fig. 3.82). Also the dis-
tance of I from the side PR is 1 implies that PR is 
the x-axis and R is the origin. Now, the equation of 
PR is y  0 and that of QR is y

4. A rational point in an analytical plane means that 
both the coordinates of the point are rational  
numbers. Then the maximum number of rational 
points on a circle C with centre (0, 
2 ) is _____.
Solution: Suppose, there are three rational points on 
circle C. Now consider that the triangle with those ratio-
nal point vertices whose circumcenter is (0, 
2 ). Since 
the vertices of this triangle are rational points, its equa-
tions of the perpendicular bisectors are first-degree equa-
tions in x and y with rational coefficients and hence the 
circumcentre must be a rational point, but here it is not a 
rational point because (0, 2 ) is the circumcentre. Hence, 
maximum number of rational points on the circle is 2.

part of k) is _____.
Solution: Let A, B and C be the centres of the circles 
with radii 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Hence, the sides of the

value is _____.
Solution: Let S y x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0 be the

that
 
2g  4f  c  5

SUMMARY 
3.1 Theorem: Equation of the circle with centre at the 
point (x1, y1) and radius r > 0 is
(x – x1)2  (y – y1)2  r2
If x1  y1  0, then the equation of the circle with 
centre at the point origin with radius r is x2
  y2  r2.
3.2 Theorem: Equation of the circle with (x1, y1) and 
(x2, y2) as extremities of a diameter is 
(x – x1)(x – x2)  (y – y1)(y –y2)  0
3.3 Parametric equations of the circle: Suppose P(x, y) 
is a point on the circle with A(x1, y1) as its centre and 
r as radius. Suppose the line AP
F E
HHH
 makes an angle P
with positive direction of the x-axis. Then x  x1 
r cos P and y  y1  r sin P are the coordinates of the 
point P. Conversely, (x1  r cos P, y1  r sin P) lies on 
the circle with centre at A(x1, y1) and radius r for all 
real values of P. Hence, x  x1  r cos P and y  y1 
r sin P (P being parameter) are called the paramet-
ric equations of the circle (x – x1)2  (y – y1)2  r2.
In particular, the parametric equations of the circle x2 
y2  r2 are x  r cos P, y  r sin P.
3.4 Point circle: Circle having radius zero is called point 
circle. That is, (x – x1)2  (y – y1)2  0  is the point 
circle with centre at (x1, y1).
3.5 General equation of the circle: If g, f and c are real 
numbers, then the equation x2  y2  2gx  2fy  c  0 
represents a circle with centre at (–g, –f ) and radius

(ii) g2  f 2 – c  0   the circle is a point circle.
(iii) g2  f 2 – c < 0   the circle is imaginary.
3.6 Universal equation of a circle: The equation ax2

by2  2gx  2fy  c  0 represents a circle if and only 
if a  b, h  0 and g2  f 2 > ac.
3.8 Theorem: The perpendicular bisector of a chord of 
a circle passes through the centre of the circle.
3.9 Relation between a circle and a line in the same 
plane: Let C be a circle with centre at A and radius 
r. Let l be a line in the plane of the circle C. Then
(i) The circle C and the line l have no common 
points   The perpendicular distance of the 
centre A from the line l is greater than the 
radius r.
(ii) The line touches the circle   The perpen-
dicular distance drawn from A onto the line 
is equal to the radius r.
(iii) The line l intersects the circle in two distinct 
points   The perpendicular distance of the

3.11 Property of S1  0: If (x1, y1) is not the centre of 
the circle S  0, then
S1 y (g  x1)x  (f  y1)y  gx1  fy1  c  0
is a first-degree equation in x and y and hence it 
represents a straight line and is perpendicular to 
the line joining the centre of the circle and the 
point (x1, y1).
3.12 Theorem (Equation of a chord): If P(x1, y1) and 
Q(x2, y2) are two points on a circle S  0, then the 
equation of the chord joining points P and Q is  
S1  S2  S12. In particular, equation of the tangent 
at (x1, y1) is S1  0.
Note: If S y x2  y2 – a2  0, then the equation of 
the chord joining P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) is 
(xx1  yy1 – a2)  (xx2  yy2 – a2)  x1x2  y1y2 – a2

(ii) P lies inside the circle if and only if AP < r.
 
(iii) P lies on the circle if and only if AP  r.
3.15 Condition for a point to lie outside or inside on the 
circle. Let S  0 be a circle and P(x1, y1) a point

(ii) P(x1, y1) lies inside the circle   S11 < 0.
 
(iii) P(x1, y1) lies on the circle   S11  0.
3.16 Theorem: From any external point of a circle, two 
tangents can be drawn to the circle. 
3.17 Condition for line to be tangent: The line y  mx  c,

circle of the circle (x – h)2  (y – k)2  r 2 is (x – h)2 
 (y – k)2  2r2.
3.19 Equation of the chord in terms of its midpoint: 
Equation of the chord of a circle S  0 whose

3.20 Definition (chord of contact): Let C be a circle 
and P be an external point to C. Suppose the two 
tangents drawn from P to C touch the circle at A 
and B. Then the chord AB is called chord of contact 
of P with respect to the circle C.
3.21 Equation of the chord of contact: Equation of the 
chord of contact of a point (x1, y1) with respect to a 
circle S  0 is S1  0.
3.22 Length of the chord: Suppose PQ is a chord of a

3.25 Angle of intersection of circles: Let C1 and C2 be two 
circles intersecting at points A and B. Then the angle 
between the tangents drawn to the circles at either of 
the points A and B is same and this angle is called the 
angle of intersection of the two circles C1 and C2.
3.26 Definition (Orthogonal circles): If the angle of 
intersection of two circles is a right angle, then 
the two circles are said to intersect each other 
orthogonally.

3.29 Suppose S  0 and Sa  0 are two non-concentric 
circles in the standard form (i.e., general form). 
Then, the equation S
S

a  0  is a first-degree 
equation in x and y. Hence it represents a line 
which is also perpendicular to the line joining the 
centres of the circles.
3.30 About the line S – Sa  0: Let S  0 and 
a 
S
0  be 
two circles with different centres in the standard 
form. Then
 
(i)  S  Sa  0 represents the common chord of the 
circles if the circles intersect.
 
(ii)  If the circles touch each other at a point P, 
then S – Sa  0 represents the common tan-
gent to the circles at P.
3.31 Definition (Power of a point): Let C be a circle 
and P be a point in the plane of C. Suppose a line 
through P meets the circle C at two points A and 
B. Then the value PA·PB is independent of the line 
through P. The power of P with respect to the circle 
C is defined as follows:
 
(i)  The value PA·PB if P is an external point to C.
 
(ii) The value –(PA·PB) if P lies inside C.
 
(iii) The value zero if P lies on the circle.
3.32 Power of a point formula: The power of P(x1, y1) 
with respect to a circle S  0 is S11.
3.33 Theorem (radical axis):  The locus of the 
point whose powers with respect to two non-
concentric circles are equal is a straight line and is 
perpendicular to the line joining the centres of the 
circles. This line is called the radical axis of the two 
circles.
3.34 Equation of the radical axis: If S  0 and Sa  0 are 
two non-concentric circles, then their radical axis 
equation is S  Sa  0
3.35 About the radical axis:
 
(i)  If the circles S  0 and Sa  0 intersect, then 
their radical axis S – Sa  0 is also a common 
chord.
 
(ii)  If the two circles touch each other, then their 
radical axis S – Sa  0 is a common tangent to 
the circles at their point of contact.
3.36 Theorem: Let C1 and C2 be two non-concentric 
circles. If a circle C cuts both C1 and C2 orthogonally, 
then the centre of C lies on the radical axis of C1 
and C2.
3.37 Radical centre: If S  0, Sa  0 and Sq  0 are three 
circles with non-collinear centres, then their radical 
axes taken two by two are concurrent and this 
point of concurrence is called the radical centre of 
the three circles.
Note: (1) The tangents drawn from the radical 
centre to each of the three circles are of equal 
length. (2) Taking the radical centre as the centre 
and the length of the tangent drawn from the radi-
cal centre to the circle as radius, if a circle is drawn, 
then this circle cuts all the circles orthogonally.
3.38 Common tangents to two circles: Let C1 and C2 
be two circles with centres A1 and A2, respectively, 
and radii r1 and r2, respectively. The following table 
shows the number of common tangent(s) to the

3.39 Centres of similitude:
(i) Suppose that the two circles C1 and C2 (dis-
cussed in 3.38) do not intersect and the radius 
r1 is not equal to r2. Then the two direct com-
mon tangents intersect on the line of centres 
and this point is called external centre of si-
militude. This external centre of similitude 
divides the segment A A
1
2  in the ratio r1:r2
externally.
(ii) The two transverse common tangents also 
intersect the line of centres in between the 
centres. This point is called the internal cen-
tre of similitude and this point divides A A
1
2
internally in the ratio r1:r2.
(iii) If the circles touch each other externally, then 
the internal centre of similitude is their point 
of contact and the external centre of simili-
tude exits as usual.
(iv) If the two circles intersect, there is no internal 
centre of similitude, but external centre of si-
militude exits.
3.40 Theorem: Combined equation of the pair of 
tangents drawn from an external point (x1, y1) to a 
circle S  0 is S1
2  S11.
3.41 Finding the common tangents to two circles:
Step1: Determine the nature of the circles.
Step2: If external centre of similitude exists, then 
find its coordinates [using 3.39(i)].
Step3: Consider a line through the external centre 
of similitude and impose the condition that it 
touches one of the circles. Then that line automati-
cally touches the other circle also. Thus, we get 
direct common tangents. Perform same with 
regards to transverse common tangents by finding 
the internal centre of similitude.
3.42 Second method to find the common tangents:
Suppose the circles are (x – x1)2  (y – y1)2  r1
2
and (x – x2)2  (y – y2)2  r2
2 . We know that the line 
(x – x1)cosP  (y – y1)sinP  r1 is a tangent to the 
first circle. Now, impose the condition that this line 
also touches the second circle and find the values 
of sinP  and cosP.
Note: In this second method, we get the common 
targets, but we do not know their nature unless we 
use further test.
3.43 S  KL  0: Let S y x2  y2  2gn  2fy  c  0 be a 
circle and L y ax  by  c  0 a straight line. Then, 
the equation S  KL  0 represents a family of 
circles for all real values of K.
Note:
 
(i)  If the line L  0 intersects the circle S  0 at 
two points P and Q, then S  KL  0 repre-
sents circles, all passing through points P and 
Q.
 
(ii)  If L  0 touches the circle S  0 at the point P, 
then S  KL  0 represents circles, all touching 
at point P. In such cases, L  0 is a common 
tangent to all these circles at point P.
 
(iii)  If S  0 and S  0 are two non-concentric cir-
cles, then S  KL  0, where S – S  0 repre-
sents a family of circles.

Chapter 4   Parabola  
In the previous chapter, we discussed about circle, general equation of a circle, equation of the tangent at a point, 
chord equation in terms of its midpoint, chord of contact, orthogonal circles, etc. In this chapter, we will discuss 
broadly about one of the conics, namely, parabola. The chapter discusses about cone, base curve or guiding curve, cir-
cular cone and right circular cone, general conic, classification of conics, double ordinate and latus rectum, parametric 
equations of y2  4ax, normal, normal chord, chord of contact, diameter of a parabola, focal chord and focal radius and 
conormal points. ‘Subjective Problems’ section provides subjective worked-out problems for the preceding sections. 
Students are advised to solve each and every problem to grasp the topics.
4.1 Conic Section
Before we discuss the properties of the conics, namely, parabola, ellipse and hyperbola, let us understand the term 
conic or conic section. Conic sections are the curves obtained by projecting a circle through a fixed point V not in 
the plane of the circle onto another plane. In fact, conics are sections of a cone by a plane cutting the cone in various 
ways (of course, the base of the cone is a circle). In this context, we used the word cone and base of the cone. While 
studying the elementary geometry and elementary solid geometry, a student visualises the shape of the cone as 
given in his or her respective textbooks. In this section, we introduce the concept of a cone in a more general way.
DEFINITION 4.1  Cone Let S be a non-empty set of points in the space. Then, S is called a cone if there ex-
ists a point V
S
  such that the line VP
F E
HH
 is contained in S for all points P in S. This point V is 
called the vertex of the cone and the line VP
F E
HH
 where P
S
  is called generator of the cone S.
 Examples 
(1) Every line is a cone with every point on the line as 
vertex and the line is the only generator.
(2) Every plane is a cone with all of its points as vertices.
(3) Two intersecting planes form a cone with every point 
on their line of intersection as vertex.
DEFINITION 4.2  Degenerate and Non-degenerate Cones The cones described in the examples of Definition 4.1 
are called degenerate cones. Generally, cones that are having more than one vertex are called 
degenerate cones. Cones which do not degenerate are called non-degenerate cones. Using the 
three-dimensional analytic geometry (Chapter 6), we can verify that the locus represented by the 
equation x
y
z
2

 is a cone with origin as the vertex.
DEFINITION 4.3  Base Curve or Guiding Curve If a plane is not passing through the vertex and intersects all 
the generators of a cone, then the intersection of the plane and the cone are called base curve 
or guiding curve.
DEFINITION 4.4  Circular Cone and Right Circular Cone If the base curve is a circle, then it is called a circular 
cone (see Fig. 4.1). If the base curve is a circle and the line connecting the centre of the base 
and the vertex of the cone is perpendicular to the plane of the circle, then the cone is called 
right circular cone.

 4.2    Parabola 
Note: In a right circular cone, the line passing through the vertex and the centre of the base circle is called the axis of 
the cone and it makes a constant angle with each of the generators and this constant angle is called semi-vertical angle 
of the cone [P  in Fig. 4.1(b)]. In a right circular cone, a plane which is not passing through the vertex and perpendicu-
lar to the axis cuts the cone in a circle. Definition 4.5 explains the geometrical concept of a parabola.
DEFINITION 4.5  Let V be the vertex of a right circular cone with semi-vertical angle P  whose axis is l. Suppose 
a plane which is not passing through the vertex makes an angle P  with l. Then, the cone sec-
tion is a plane curve called parabola (see Fig. 4.2).

Now, let us define a general conic using two-dimensional geometry.
DEFINITION 4.6  General Conic Let l be a fixed line, S be a fixed point which does not lie on l and e be a 
positive real number. Then, the locus of the point P, such that the distance SP is equal to 
e times the perpendicular distance of l from P, is called a conic. For this conic, the fixed 
line l is called directrix, the fixed point S is called focus and the number e is called the  
eccentricity.
DEFINITION 4.7 Classification of Conics Conics are classified according to their eccentricity e.
1. If e  1, then the conic is called parabola.
2. If 0  e  1, then the conic is called ellipse.
3. If e 1, then the conic is called hyperbola.
In this chapter, we will discuss about parabola.

 4.2    Parabola 
DEFINITION 4.8  Double Ordinate and Latus Rectum Suppose a line perpendicular to the axis of parabola 
meets the curve at P and Q. Then, PQ is called double ordinate of the curve. In particular, 
double ordinate passing through the focus is called latus rectum. Usually, the ends of the latus 
rectum are denoted by L and La (see Fig. 4.5).
THEOREM 4.3
The length of the latus rectum of the parabola y

two corresponding values for y. In this case we say 
that the curve is symmetric about x-axis.
2. x m  d   y m ± d.
3. The point on the curve where the axis meets the 
curve is called the vertex.
4. For y2  4ax, (0, 0) is the vertex and y-axis is the 
tangent at the vertex.
DEFINITION 4.9  Parametric Equations of y2  4ax For all real values t, the point (at2, 2at) lies on the parabola 
y2  4ax. Conversely, if (x1, y1) is a point on the curve y2  4ax, then take t

 so that 
x1  at2. That is, if (x1, y1) is a point on the curve y2  4ax, there corresponds a real t such that 
x1  at2, y1  2at. Hence, the equations x  at2, y  2at, t  R are called the parametric equations 
of the parabola y2  4ax.

4.2.1 Classiﬁcation of Points
Let P(x, y) be a point in the plane of the parabola. If x  0, then P is called external point to the curve. Suppose x  0. 
Then, draw PM perpendicular to the axis (i.e., x-axis) meeting the curve at point Q. Point P is called external or inter-
nal point to the curve according as PM  QM or PM  QM (see Fig. 4.6).

Note: In general, when the focus, directrix and the eccentricity of the conic are given, its equation is a second-degree 
general equation in x and y. The converse can be proved under certain conditions. Discussion of second-degree general 
equation is out of scope of this book and generally it is not taught in Class 12 level.

DEFINITION 4.15 
 Focal Chord and Focal Radius  The chord passing through the focus of a parabola is called the 
focal chord. If P is a point on a parabola with focus S, then SP is called the focal radius of P.

4. The circle described on a focal chord touches the directrix.

vertex.
6. The circle described on a focal radius of a point P(at2, 2at) cuts an intercept of length a

7. The tangents drawn at the extremities of a focal chord are at right angles and hence intersect

THEOREM 4.20 
(NUMBER OF 
NORMALS FROM 
A POINT)
In general, three normals can be drawn through a point in the plane of a parabola to the curve.
PROOF
Let P(h, k) be a point in the plane of y2  4ax. It is known that the normal to parabola at (at2, 2at) 
(see Theorem 4.10) is tx  y  2at  at3. This normal passes through P h k

three points on the curve at which normals drawn to the parabola are concurrent at P(h, k).

DEFINITION 4.16 
 Conormal Points  Points on a parabola are called conormal points if the normals drawn at 
them are concurrent.
Section 4.2.2 provides a procedure to determine the number of normals from a given point to a parabola. Since the 
proof involves Cardon’s method of solving a cubic equation, generally, the proof is avoided. Students are advised to 
adopt only the procedure.
4.2.2 Procedure to Determine Number of Normals
Let P(x1, y1) be a point in the plane of the parabola. From Theorem 4.20, the normal at (at2, 2at) passes through  
P(x1, y1) if and only if
 
tx

point
(A) (5, 3), 
(B) (3, 4), 
(C) (2, 4) 
(D) (4, 3)
Solution: Since the circle cuts the parabola y2  4x or-
thogonally at (1, 2), the tangent to the parabola at (1, 2) 
should pass through the centre of the circle. That is,  
y(2) − 2(x  1)  0 passes through the centre. That is, y  
x  1 passes through (3, 4).

56. In the parabola y2  4x, the tangent at the point P, 
whose abscissa is equal to the latus rectum, meets 
the axis at T and the normal at P cuts the curve 
again at Q. Then the ratio PT:PQ is
(A) 5:4

(C) 2:3 
(D) 3:2
Solution: We have
y2  4ax(a  1)
By hypothesis, at P  (4, 4) so that the tangent equation 
at P (4, 4) is 2y  x  4 which implies that

4. Length of the sub-normal to the parabola y2  8x at 
any point is ______.
Solution: In fact, we show that the length of the sub-
normal to the curve y2  4ax at any point on the curve 
is equal to 2a. Suppose that the tangent and normal to 
y2  4ax at P(at2, 2at) meet axis of the curve at T and N, 
respectively. Draw PG perpendicular to the axis (see Fig. 
4.34). Hence, TG  sub-tangent and GN  sub-normal 
(see Definition 3.4, Chapter 3, Vol. 3, pg 225).
The tangent at P(at2, 2at) is ty  x  at2. This meets axis 
at T(at2, 0) Normal at P(at2, 2at) is tx  y  2at  at3. This

SUMMARY 
4.1 Definition: Let L be a straight line and S be a point 
on the plane of the line L and not on L. Then, the lo-
cus of the point which is equidistant from the point S 
and the line L is called a parabola. For this parabola, 
S is called focus and L is called directrix.
4.2 Theorem: Standard equation of a parabola is y2  
4ax (a  0). The focus is (a, 0) and the directrix equa-
tion is x  a  0.
4.3 The other standard forms of parabola are as fol-
lows:
1. y2  4ax [focus is (−a, 0) and directrix is 
x − a  0]
2. x2  4ay [focus is (0, a) and directrix is y  a  0]

called the axis of the parabola.
4.5 Note: 
1. x-axis is the axis of y2  4ax and y2  4ax.
2. y-axis is the axis of x2  4ay and x2  4ay.

 4.6 Double ordinate and latus rectum: If a line 
perpendicular to the axis meets the curve at P and 
Pa, then PPa is called double ordinate. A double 
ordinate passing through the focus is called latus 
rectum.
 4.7 Length of the latus rectum of the parabola y2  4ax 
is 4a (i.e., the coefficient of x).
 4.8 Parametric equations: x  at2, y  2at, t Z  are 
called the parametric equations of the parabola y2  
4ax. That is, for all real values of t, the point (at2, 2at) 
lies on the parabola y2  4ax.

Hyperbola
An ellipse is a section of a cone by a 
plane such that the plane parallel to 
it through the vertex meets the plane 
of the base in a line external to it. 
A conic whose eccentricity is greater 
than unity is known as hyperbola.

Chapter 5   Ellipse and Hyperbola  
In this chapter, we discuss about ellipse, hyperbola and their properties. ‘Subjective Problems’ sections provide worked-out 
subjective problems for the preceding sections. Students are advised to solve each and every problem to grasp the topics.
5.1 Ellipse
An ellipse is a section of a cone by a plane such that the plane parallel to it through the vertex meets the plane of the 
base in a line external to it. Definition 5.1 is the plane geometrical definition.
DEFINITION 5.1 
 Let l  be a line and S be a point on the plane of l, but not on l. Let 0  e  1 be a fixed number. 
Then the locus of the point whose distance from the point S is e times the distance of the point 
from the line l is called ellipse. The point S is called the focus and l is called the directrix cor-
responding to S.
THEOREM 5.1
The standard equation of an ellipse is

PROOF
See Fig. 5.1. Let l be the directrix and S be the focus. Draw SZ perpendicular to l and divide SZ
internally and externally at A and Aa in the ratio e : 1 (where 0  e  1). Let C be the midpoint of 
a
A A  and AaC  CA  a. We consider CS
F E
HH
 as x-axis and line through C and perpendicular to CS
F E
HH
 
as y-axis (see Fig. 5.1). We can see that C  (0, 0), A  (a, 0) and Aa  (−a, 0). Also SA  e(AZ) 
and SAa  eAaZ. Therefore,

of the ellipse. 2a is called the length of the major axis and 2b is called the length of the minor

where a  b, the locus of P is an ellipse with centre at 
the intersection of the lines l and la and having major 
and minor axes along the lines la and l, respectively, and 
they are of lengths 2a and 2b, respectively. 
 Example    5.3
If the focus, centre and eccentricity of an ellipse are (2, 
3), (3, 4) and 1/2, respectively, then find the equation of 
the ellipse.
Solution: It is known that the major axis is along the 
line joining the centre (2, 3) and the focus (3, 4). Its equa-
tion is
x − y  1  0 = la  (say)
The minor axis is the line through (2, 3) and perpendicu-
lar to the major axis. Its equation is
x  y − 5  0 = l (say)

DEFINITION 5.10 
 The line of collinearity of the midpoints of parallel chords of an ellipse is called the diameter 
of the ellipse.
THEOREM 5.14
If one diameter of an ellipse bisects the chords parallel to another, then the second one bisects the 
chords parallel to the first. These types of diameters are called conjugate diameters.
PROOF
From Theorem 5.13, the midpoints of chords parallel to y  mx lies on the line b2x  a2my  0. 
Hence, the midpoints of the chords parallel to b2x  a2my  0 whose slope is

Let us consider that the tangent to ellipse which is given

gents to Eq. (5.43) at P and Q. Let T be (h, k). Since PQ 
is the chord of contact of T with respect to the ellipse 
which is given in Eq. (5.43), the equation of PQ is

Chapter 5   Ellipse and Hyperbola  
5.3 Hyperbola
Hyperbola is a conic whose eccentricity is greater than unity. In this section, we discuss the principal properties that are 
common to all hyperbolas. Some of these properties are same as that of the ellipse and can be proved in a similar way. 
However, the additional feature that the hyperbola possess is a pair of asymptotes (tangents with points of contact at 
infinity) which gives the curve its own properties. Let us start the discussion with the formal definition of hyperbola.
DEFINITION 5.12 
 Let l be a straight line (called the directrix), S be a point which is not located on l (called the 
focus) and e  1 be a fixed real number (called the eccentricity). Then, the locus of the point 
P such that SP is equal to (e PM), where PM is the perpendicular distance of P from the 
directrix, is called a hyperbola.
 Example    5.9 
Find the equation of the hyperbola whose directrix is

To each value of y, there are two values for x.
3. The abscissae a of any point should not be between –a and a.
4. The curve cuts the x-axis at (−a, 0) and (a, 0).
5. The curve cannot intersect y-axis.
6. As y increases infinitely, x also increases infinitely.
7. Due to the symmetry of the curve, there is another focus Sa(−ae, 0); the corresponding directrix is x

DEFINITIONS 5.13
1. Aa(−a, 0) and A(a, 0) are called the vertices of the curve and AaA is called the transeverse axis whose length is 2a.
2. If B  (0, −b) and Ba  (0, b), then BBa is called the conjugate axis whose length is 2b.

Due to this reason, asymptotes are also stated as lines through the centres which touch the curve at infinity. In general, 
a line l is called an asymptote to a curve if the line l goes nearer and nearer to the curve, but never meets the curve.

1. The chord of contact of any point on an asymptote is parallel to the same asymptote.
2. The product of the perpendiculars drawn from any point on the curve onto its asymptotes is 
constant.
3. The foot of the perpendicular from a focus onto an asymptote is one of the points of intersec-
tion of the corresponding directrix with the auxiliary circle.
4. If a straight line cuts the curve at P and Q and the asymptotes at R and S, then PR  QS.

Answer: (A)
 (iii)  We know that the portion of the tangent is inter-
cepted between the asymptote is bisected at the 
point of contact (see Theorem 5.28). In fact the 
asymptotes are x  p 3y and the tangent at (3, 0)

asymptotes at points (3, 1) and (3, − 1) so that the 
midpoint of the segment is (3, 0).

Three-Dimensional Geometry

Chapter 6   Three-Dimensional Geometry  
Geometry is a fascinating and thought-provoking topic since its origin. Greek philosopher Plato once pronounced 
that “God always geometrizes” and he went on this philosophy to such an extent that he denied entry into his acad-
emy to anyone who knew nothing about geometry. Fundamentally, geometry is divided into two parts such as plane 
geometry (two-dimensional geometry) and solid geometry (three-dimensional geometry). In this chapter, we learn 
three-dimensional geometry for which we have to know some fundamentals of Euclidean pure geometry, solid 
geometry and vectors.
The aim of this chapter is to present standard properties of lines and planes with vector algebra approach.
6.1 Pre-Requisites
Though we have discussed about vector algebra in Vol. 2, we list out some of the concepts and results (without proofs) 
of vector algebra in this section for the convenience of the students. In this chapter, though coordinate methods are 
explained, we give significance to vector methods since they are easy to understand. We begin the discussion with non-
empty set S (Z3) called space and the elements of S are called points. Lines and planes are certain sub-sets of S. They 
would be the central point of discussion in this chapter. First, let us discuss about the axioms on which Euclidean 
geometry was built. This approach was propounded by Euclid which was further developed by Hilbert. Throughout 
this chapter, Z  represents the set of all real numbers.
AXIOM 6.1
 Given any two distinct points, there is one and only one line passing through them. If the two 
points are A and B, then the line is denoted by AB
F E
HHH
.
AXIOM 6.2
 Three non-collinear points determine unique plane. The plane determined by three non-collinear 
points A, B and C is denoted by ABC
F
E
HHHHH
.
AXIOM 6.3
If two distinct points lie in a plane, then the line passing through them also lies in the same 
plane.
AXIOM 6.4
 If two planes intersect, they intersect in a unique straight line (see the proof using coordinates in 
Section 6.2).
AXIOM 6.5
 On every straight line, there are at least two points. In every plane, there are at least three non-
collinear points and in the space there are at least four non-coplanar points.
Axioms 6.1–6.5 are called incidence postulates.
AXIOM 6.6
 For any two points, there corresponds a non-zero real number called distance. The function which 
spell this correspondence is called distance function which is denoted by d and the distance 
between the points A and B is denoted by d(A, B). The distance function satisfies the following 
conditions: d: S s S m Z  is a function such that
1. d(A, B) r 0.
2. d(A, B)  0 if and only if A  B.
3. d(A, B)  d(B, A).
Hereafter, in this chapter we will denote d(A, B) by AB.
DEFINITION 6.1 Coordinate System Let L be a straight line and f: L m Z  an injection such that
f P
f Q
PQ
P Q
L
( )
( )
,




Then f is called coordinate system on the line L and f(P) is called x-coordinate of P.

387
 6.1    Pre-Requisites 
AXIOM 6.7
Every line has a coordinate system. This is called Rooler axiom.
Note:
1. Every line may have many coordinate systems.
2. If A and B are two points on line L, then there exists a coordinate system on L such that the coordinate of A is zero 
and the coordinate of B is positive.
AXIOM 6.8
(BETWEENNESS)
 If A, B and C are collinear points such that
AB  BC  AC
then B is said to be in between A and C and is denoted by A − B − C. If A and B are two points, then 
{

F E
HHH
 is called segment joining A and B and is denoted by AB. Generally AB  is 
also denoted by AB; however, as per the context, we can know whether it refers to the distance 
between A and B or segment AB.
DEFINITION 6.2  Ray Let A and B be two distinct points. Then {
}
P
AB A
BP


F E
HHH
 is called a ray from A through 
point B.
Generally, there exists confusion while mentioning a ray and a vector. The ray is denoted by AB
H E
HHH
.  The vector with A 
as initial point and B as terminal point is also denoted by AB
H E
HHH
.  Generally AB
H E
HHH
 denotes vector AB
H E
HHH
.  Hence, while men-
tioning AB
H E
HHH
 as ray, we mention that AB
H E
HHH
 is a ray. Further, vector AB
H E
HHH
 has a finite length whereas ray AB
H E
HHH
 has no finite 
length.
DEFINITION 6.3 Parallel Lines and Parallel Rays
1. Let L1 and L2 be two coplanar lines (i.e., in the same planes). Then L1 and L2 are said to be 
parallel if either L1  L2 or L1 and L2 do not have a common point. If L1 and L2 are parallel, 
then we write L
L
1 %
2  and if they are not parallel, then we write L
L

.
2. Let AB
H E
HHH
 and CD
H E
HH
 be two rays. They are said to be parallel either if both AB
H E
HHH
 and CD
H E
HH
 are 
on the same line and one is a sub-set of the other or if the lines AB
H E
HHH
 and CD
H E
HH
 are distinct 
parallel lines and B and D lie on the same side of the line AC
F E
HHH

AXIOM 6.9
(PARALLEL 
AXIOM)
There will be one and only one line passing through a given point and parallel to a given line.
Using the above definitions and axioms, we can prove the Euclidean geometry theorems. However, for this process, we 
need some of the solid geometry theorems which we list below without their proofs.
THEOREM 6.1
If two distinct lines intersect, then they intersect at a unique point.
THEOREM 6.2
If a line, which is not in a given plane, intersects the plane, then it intersects at one and only one 
point.
THEOREM 6.3
There is one and only one plane containing a given line and a point which is not located on the 
line.
THEOREM 6.4
Two distinct intersecting lines determine unique plane.

DEFINITION 6.4  Suppose L is a line intersecting a plane E at point P. If L is perpendicular to every line in the 
plane E which passes through point P, then L is said to be perpendicular to E and we write 
L > E.

the segment joining the two points perpendicularly.
THEOREM 6.8
The lines perpendicular to the same plane are parallel.
THEOREM 6.9
For a given plane, there is one and only one line perpendicular to the plane at a given point 
in it.
THEOREM 6.10
The set of all lines perpendicular to a given line at a given point constitutes a plane which is per-
pendicular to the line at that given point.
THEOREM 6.11

THREE PER-
PENDICULARS)
Let E be a plane and P be a point in the space, but not located in E. Let M be the foot of the per-

nates of P, respectively, and we write P  (x, y, z). That is, with reference to a frame of axes, to each point P in the 
space, there corresponds an ordered triad (x, y, z) of real numbers. Conversely, suppose (x, y, z) is an ordered triad 
of real numbers. Let L, M and N be the points on x-, y- and z-axes such the x is the coordinate of L, y is the coordi-
nate of M and z is the coordinate of N. At L, M and N, draw the planes perpendicular to x-, y- and z-axes, respec-
tively, meeting at point P (see Fig. 6.20). Since the line PL lies in the plane perpendicular to x-axis at L, it follows 
that PL is perpendicular to x-axis (see Definition 6.4). Similarly, the lines PM and PN are perpendicular to y-axis 
and z-axis, respectively. Hence x, y and z are the coordinates of P where P  (x, y, z). That is, to each ordered trial 
(x, y, z) of real numbers, there corresponds unique point P such that P  (x, y, z) with reference to Oxyz. Thus, with 
reference to a frame of reference, we established a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the set of all 
points in the space and the set or all ordered triad (x, y, z) of real numbers. This space is called three-dimensional 
space which is denoted by Z3.
The three coordinate axes divide the space Z3  into eight parts called octants. Table 6.1 shows the signs of the coor-
dinates of any point in the space. Since PQ is perpendicular to zx-plane at Q, by Theorem 6.5, it is perpendicular to 
both QL and QN so that OLQN is a rectangle and hence OL  NQ and ON  QL. Also OQPN is a rectangle, so we 
have Ox  PQ. Thus,

6.3.1 System of Planes
We have discussed that the first-degree equation ax
by
cz
d



 0  represents a plane. This equation is called general 
equation of a plane. Since one of a, b and c is not equal to zero, we can consider ax 0. Then, the plane equation can be 
written as
x
b
a y
c
a z
d
a



 0
Hence, if the values of b a c a
d a
/ ,
/
/
and
 are given, then we can determine the plane equation. If the three ratios 
b a c a
d a
/ , /
/
and
 are to be determined uniquely, we need three conditions. If lesser number of conditions is given, then 
the ratios b a c a
d a
/ , /
/
and
 can be determined in many ways. The planes so obtained are called system of planes.
For example, if we fix a, b and c and vary d, then ax
by
cz
d



 0  represents system of parallel planes. For all those 
planes (a, b, c) is the normal. If (

 6.3    Plane 
 QUICK LOOK 10
To determine the plane bisecting the acute angle 
between the planes, consider one of the planes E1 or 
E2 and one of the bisecting planes, say, E. If the angle 
between the plane E and one of E1 and E2 and one of 
the bisecting planes, say, is less than Tan
,
1 1  then E is 
the acute angle bisector plane.
Note: As in the case of straight lines, on the similar lines, we can find acute and obtuse angle bisecting planes and 
plane bisecting the origin angle (see Theorems 2.25 and 2.26 and Quick Look 14, Chapter 2).

It is said that if two planes intersect, they intersect in a straight line (Axiom 6.4) and the equation of a plane is a first-
degree equation in x, y and z. Hence, a straight line can be represented by a pair of intersecting planes. For example, 
x-axis is the intersection of xy-plane and zx-plane and hence x-axis equations are y

Case 1: All three planes 0

and
 are parallel to each other (i.e., their normals are parallel).
Case 2: Two planes are parallel and the third plane intersects them in parallel lines (see Fig. 6.3, Theorem 6.12).
Case 3: No two planes of 0

Chapter 6   Three-Dimensional Geometry  
1. All three planes interest at a point. That is, the three lines of intersection of the planes, which are taken 
pairwise, are concurrent [see Fig 6.6(a), Theorem 6.18]. Example: every corner of a room is a point of in-
tersection of three planes.
2. All three planes intersect in a single line [see Fig 6.6(b), Theorem 6.18].
3. Every two planes intersect in a line which is parallel to the third plane. In this case, the planes form a 
triangular prism [see Fig 6.6(c), Theorem 6.18]. That is, if 0

6.4.2 Method to Solve Problems on Three Planes
1. Check whether all three planes are parallel. If all the three planes are parallel, then no common solution exists for 
the three equations.
2. If two planes are parallel and the third intersects both in parallel lines, then there exists no common solution.
3. If $ x 0,  then all three planes meet at a unique point.
4. If $  0  and one of $

Solution: Let the given lines be L1 and L2, respectively. 
Every point on L1 is of the form (1  2t, 2  3t, 3  4t) and 
every point on L2 is of the form (4  5s, 1  2s, s). These 
two lines intersect at same point P. This implies

Solution: Let L1 and L2 be the two given lines so that 
the general points on L1 and L2 are (1  3t, − 1  2t, 1  5t) 
and (2  4s, 1  3s, − 1 − 2s), respectively. The two lines L1 
and L2 intersect. This implies for same t and s we have

6.18. Theorem: If a plane E  0 cuts a line joining two

then the ratio

Further, A and B are on opposite sides the plane E 
 0 if E11 and E22 are of opposite signs and A and B 
lie on the same side if E11 and E22 are of same signs. 
In particular, if E  ax  by  cz  d  0, then a point 
(x1, y1, z1) lies in the origin side if E11 and d are 
of same signs and (x1, y1, z1) lies on the non-origin 
side of the plane, if E11 and d have opposite signs.
6.19. Theorem: If E1  0 and E2  0 are two intersecting 
planes which intersect in a line L, then any plane 
passing through the line L is of the form

Matrix-Match Type Questions 
In each of the following questions, statements are given in 
two columns, which have to be matched. The statements in 
column I are labeled as (A), (B), (C) and (D), while those 
in column II are labeled as (p), (q), (r), (s) and (t). Any 
given statement in column I can have correct matching with 
one or more statements in column II. The appropriate bub-
bles corresponding to the answers to these questions have 
to be darkened as illustrated in the following example.
Example: If the correct matches are (A) m (p), (s), (B) m 
(q), (s), (t), (C) m (r), (D) m (r), (t), that is if the matches 
are (A) m (p) and (s); (B) m (q), (s) and (t); (C) m (r);
