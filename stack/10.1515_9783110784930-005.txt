Rules for Deriving Rules

§ 42 Notation
The language of the elementary syllogistic will be gradually constructed in this
and in the following four sections. In the next three paragraphs we are concerned
only with a few signs, namely, only those allotted to this language to present the
derivation of rules from other rules. They are the following:
(1) Descriptive symbols: I use ‘p1, ‘p2’, . . ., ‘pn’ as signs for propositions. Each of
these signs stands for a certain declarative proposition and can be regarded as an
abbreviation for such a proposition. I use ‘p’, ‘q’, and ‘r’ to abbreviate the first
three signs ‘p1, ‘p2’, and ‘p3’.
(2) Logical constants: Of the logical signs which can appear within a proposition,
in this section the only one that occurs is ‘N . . .’, the sign for elementary negation.
Its meaning will be explained in § 43, definition 2.
(3) Metalogical signs: More than one kind of sign will be needed to be able to
speak about the logical properties of propositions and about the relations be-
tween propositions rendered with logical constants. As names (or metavariables)
for formulas that stand for declarative propositions, such as, e.g., ‘p1’, ‘N p2’, or
‘NN p3’, I use a non-cursive capital letter, e.g., A, with a subscripted index number:
‘A1, ‘A2’, ‘A3’, . . ., ‘An’. To abbreviate, I also write instead of the first five of these
signs ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, and ‘E’.
To express that a proposition B regularly follows from a set of propositions A1,
. . ., An, I write ‘A1, . . ., An  B’. To express that a proposition follows from others
logically, I write ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B’. Definitions 3 and 4 in § 43 will explain the distinc-
tion between regular and logical consequence.
To express that a rule of inference σn+1 can be reduced to a rule of inference
σn or to several rules of inference σ1, . . ., σn, I write ‘σ1, . . ., σn / σn+1’. The relation
between inferences expressed by ‘. . . / . . .’ will be explained in § 43, definition 5.
(4) Punctuation signs:
(a)
Comma: To save space, the first premises of an inference will not be written
one below the other, as in this example
https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110784930-005

but beside each other, separated by a comma, as in the example A, B ∴C or
A, B  C. Secondly, ‘A1, . . ., An  B, C’ and ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B, C’ express that
each B and C follow from the same premises.
(b)
Brackets: The binding strength of expressions of the form ‘N . . .’, ‘. . ., . . .’, ‘. . .
 . . .’ (or ‘. . . ∴. . . ’), and ‘. . . / . . .’ decrease in this order. When an expres-
sion that contains a logical constant or a metalogical sign is enclosed in round
brackets, ‘(. . .’ and ‘. . .)’, the parts of this expression are bound more strongly
together than with expressions outside the brackets.
(5) Simplification rules:
(a)
The outermost brackets of a formula may be omitted.
(b)
Two expressions ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B’ and ‘A1, . . ., An ∴C’ may be combined into the
expression ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B, C’. Likewise, two expressions ‘A1, . . ., Aj ∴B’ and
‘Ak, . . ., An ∴B’ may be combined into the expression ‘A1, . . ., Aj, Ak, . . .,
An ∴B’.
(c)
Two expressions ‘A1, . . ., An ∴B1, . . ., Bn’ and ‘B1, . . ., Bn ∴A1, . . ., An’ may be
combined into the expression ‘A1, . . ., An : : B1, . . ., Bn’. Likewise, two expres-
sions ‘A1, . . ., An  B1, . . ., Bn’ and ‘B1, . . ., Bn  A1, . . ., An’ may be combined
into the expression ‘A1, . . ., An  B1, . . ., Bn’.
(d)
The order of propositional formulas A1, A2, . . ., B, C, etc. may be arbitrarily
interchanged if they are separated by no other signs than commas and are the
only expressions that appear before or after the signs  or ∴. Thus, ‘A1, . . .,
An, B ∴C, D’ may be replaced by ‘B, A1, . . ., An ∴D, C’.
§ 43 Definitions
1. A is a negatable expression if and only if one of the two following conditions is
satisfied: (a) A is a substitute for one of the propositional letters p1, . . ., pn, i.e.,
there is an interpretation in which A is a true or false proposition, or (b) A equals
N B and B is in turn a negatable expression.
2. A is an elementary negation, that is, A equals N B (in words: not B), if and only
if, for every interpretation in which B and C are true or false: (1) A is true if B is
false or there is a false proposition C, with B = N C, and it is possible that N B and
N C are both true; (2) A is false if B is true or there is a true proposition C, with
B = N C, and it is possible that N B and N C are both false.

Scholium: ‘False’ should here mean simply ‘not true’. Propositions are in this
usage true or false (therefore bivalent).165
Elementary negation, as it is defined here, is not a truth function; i.e., the possible
truth values of the elementary negation are not sufficiently determined by the truth
value of the negated proposition. One could also say: there is no two-column truth
table for N B – unless one assumes for such a table that there is no C such that B equals
N C. But even in this case, the main column of the table contains a row which may not
be filled in with T or F, since it can happen that B and N B are both false.166
The question marks in this table are each supposed to express that the truth or
falsity of B is, in certain circumstances, compatible with the falsity or truth of
N B. The falsity of B is not a sufficient condition for the truth of N B. In case B and
N B are both false, N B is ambivalent with respect to its truth value, i.e., it is also
true. Namely, in this case N B is true insofar as N B rightly denies a false proposi-
tion, and at the same time false, insofar as N B is rightly negated by NN B. Because
of the possible truth-ambivalence of expressions of the form N C, the case can arise
in which N C and NN C are both true. This case is accounted for in the table. It is
the case in which B = N C and C as well as N C are both false. Only the case in
which B is a true proposition and there is no false proposition C with B = N C is a
case in which NN B is also true at the same time.
3. If A1, . . ., An (with n ≧1) and B are formulas which admit an interpretation
as true or false propositions, then with this interpretation B follows regularly
from A1, . . ., An (symbolically expressed: A1, . . ., An  B) if and only if it is im-
possible that each of the premises A1, . . ., An as well as N B is true, and it is im-
possible, if B is a negated proposition of the form N C, that each of the premises
A1, . . ., An as well as C is true.167

A proposition like “Ten is not a wicked number” – which one might treat as meaningless
and thus as neither true nor false – is false in all circumstances if one takes it as the elementary
negation of the proposition ‘Ten is a wicked number’. That it is false does not mean, however,
that the negated proposition is true. Compare my comments above in § 10.
See above, §§ 8 to 10.
In his 1936 work, Alfred Tarski has defined the concept of logical consequence in a similar way
as I have here defined the (broader) concept of regular consequence, namely thus: “The statement
form B is a logical consequence of the statement forms A1, . . ., An, if any interpretation of the propo-
sitional, predicate, and individual variables appearing in A1, . . ., An and B which turns all of A1, . . .,
1 Principles § 43
151

Scholium: This definition agrees in essentials with the four principles estab-
lished by Aristotle in An. pr. B 1–4 in order to isolate the concept of consequence.
These principles say roughly: (1) From the true, only the true follows; (2) from the
false, the true or false can follow; (3) the false can follow only if at least one prem-
ise is false; and (4) the true can follow from premises which are true or false.
The modality expressed in the above definition and in the Aristotelian princi-
ple (1) can be understood in such a way that it says that at no time and in no
thinkable circumstances is a proposition true whose consequent is nevertheless
false. Accordingly, a proposition q follows regularly from a proposition p if and
only if – on any grounds whatever – it holds at no time and in no thinkable cir-
cumstances that p and the negation of q are true. In this sense, one can say for
example that it follows regularly – say, on grounds pertaining to geometrical op-
tics – that the moon appears as a half-circle from the fact that it stands at quadra-
ture. In the same sense one can say that the diagnosis of a sickness follows – on
medical grounds – from the determination of all unambiguous symptoms of this
sickness. Valid rules, according to which such consequences occur and make pos-
sible contentful inference, can be rules of arbitrary content, e.g., conventions, nat-
ural laws, or mathematical theorems; they need not be logical rules: not all
grounds on which it is impossible or necessary that different propositions have
different or the same truth values are logical grounds.
Equivalent to the proposition ‘B follows regularly from A1, . . ., An’ is the proposition:
‘B (the consequent) may be concluded from A1, . . ., An (the premises)’. The consequence
which is here being discussed need not be a consequence valid on formal grounds or
according to logical rules. If n is greater than 1, then the consequence is called an infer-
ence and the consequent a concluding proposition or simply a conclusion.
4. If A1, . . ., An (with n ≧1) and B are formulas which admit an interpretation as
true or false propositions, then B follows logically from A1, . . ., An (symbolically
expressed: A1, . . ., An ∴B) if and only if the proposition B follows regularly from
A1, . . ., An and this consequence depends only on the definition of the logical con-
stants which occur in B and A1, . . ., An respectively.
Scholium: Logical consequence is a special case of regular consequence; it is
namely just that form of consequence based on the meaning of logical constants
which occur in those propositions between which the consequence relation obtains.
I call an inference from two premises whose conclusion follows logically
from them a formal inference or syllogism.
An into true statements, also turns B into a true statement.” In §§ 80–81, I will go more precisely into
the relationship between the now standard (‘semantic’) concept of logical consequence, which goes
back to Tarski, and the here defined concept of regular consequence.

5. If σ1, . . ., σn and σn+1 are rules according to which propositions follow from
other propositions regularly, then σn+1 is reducible to σ1, . . ., σn (symbolically ex-
pressed: σ1, . . ., σn /σn+1) if and only if, on that assumption that σ1, . . ., σn are valid
rules, σn+1 cannot be an invalid rule.
§ 44 Basic Rules
By basic rules I understand here and in what follows only those rules whose va-
lidity depends exclusively and immediately on the meaning of the logical and
meta-logical signs which are used in their formulation. To see their validity, it suf-
fices to consider the definitions which underlie the signs used in them. Denying
their validity results in a contradiction with the respective definitions.
If A, Ai, . . ., Ak, B, Cm, . . ., Cn and D are formulas which admit an interpreta-
tion which has one of the two truth values, then there are valid rules which corre-
spond to schemata (I. 1) to (I. 3):
1. Double negation as a result of an affirmation:
A ∴NN A (with A ≠N B, for arbitrary B) 168
(I. 1)
2. Reduction rules:
Reduction rules are metalogical rules, i.e., rules for the derivation of logical rules.
Reductio ad absurdum (or rule for inference conversion):
(A1, . . ., An ∴A) / (N A, A2, . . ., An ∴N A1), . . ., (N A, A1, . . ., An-1 ∴N An) (with n ≧1)
(I. 2)
Scholium: The schema (I. 2) corresponds to a metalogical basic rule of the Aristote-
lian syllogistic.169 Apuleius formulates it in this way: “If a third [proposition] is col-
lected [i.e., is inferred] from two, either of them together with the opposite of the
conclusion collects [i.e., entails] the opposite of the remaining one” (Apuleius, De int.
The converse counterpart to (I. 1), that is: NN A ∴A, is not valid, since NN A does not state
that A is true, but rather only that N A is false, and it is not ruled out that A and N A are both
false. The medieval doctrine “duplicata negatio efficit affirmatio” – which, based on Diogenes
Laertius, Vitae, VII. 89, is sometimes attributed already to Chrysippus – holds only for A = N B,
with B ≠N C (for arbitrary C), or in the form (VI. 4) NN A  A; see § 72 below.
See Aristotle, Sophistici Elenchi 163 a 32 and An. pr. 59 b 1 ff.; cf. Alexander, In an. pr. 29, 7 ff.,
In top. 582, 23 ff. and Philoponus, In an. pr. 423, 4 ff. On these passages, see Frede 1974, 172. – The
rule also plays a fundamental role in Stoic logic under the name “first directive” (πρῶτον ϑέμα).

191, 5 ff. [1987, 101]).170 The index signs specify no fixed order of premise formulas.
Rather, this order may be arbitrarily altered in a derivation.
Peripatetic inference chain rule:
(Ai, . . ., Ak ∴B), (B, Cm, . . ., Cn ∴D) / (Ai, . . ., Ak, B, Cm, . . ., Cn ∴D)
(i ≧0, k ≧i, m ≧0 and n ≧m)
(I. 3)
Scholium: The inference chain schema (I. 3) corresponds to the so-called synthetic theo-
rem of the Peripatetic syllogistic.171 Its validity results from the transitivity of the rela-
tion of logical consequence, which is why B may be omitted in the third position. Here
as well, the index signs do not specify a fixed order of premise formulas. This order
may be arbitrary altered in a derivation (according to § 42 (5) (d)).

§ 45 Rules Derived From the Basic Rules
If A, Ai, . . ., Ak, B, Cm, . . ., Cn and D are formulas which admit an interpretation as
propositions that are true or false, then the following rules (I. 4) to (I. 8) are valid:
1. Metalogical rules:172
Simple transitivity in the inference chain:173

See Alexander of Aphrodisias, In an. pr. 384, 13–15; cf. Frede 1974, 173; Frede has represented
the synthetic theorem in a form which substantially corresponds to schema (I. 3).
Rules (I. 4), (I. 5), and (II. 6) correspond to the three metalogical rules – so-called directives
(ϑέματα) – in Stoic logic. They go by the designations “second,” “third,” and “fourth directive,”
respectively. According to Alexander of Aphrodisias, the Stoics developed these three rules from
the synthetic theorem of Peripatetic logic. See Alexander, In an. pr. 284, 13–15. The way in which I
present these rules here corresponds to the reconstruction of these rules by Frede; compare his
1974, 178–80. Instead of letters as metavariables, the Stoics use designations for numbers of
order: “the first,” “the second,” etc.
Rule (I. 4) agrees with the third directive of the Stoic syllogistic; cf. Frede’s 1974, 192–93,
reconstruction.

The reduction formula in line [1] of this derivation is identical to (I. 3). The move
from [1] to [2] results from the stipulation of m = 1 and Cn = Cm.

(Ai, . . ., Ak ∴A), (Ak+1, . . ., An ∴B 1), (A, B 1 ∴D) / A 1, . . ., An ∴D

/ (Ai, . . ., Ak, Cm, . . ., Cn ∴D)

[4] (Ai, . . ., Ak ∴B), (Ak+1, . . ., An ∴C), (B, C ∴D)
/ (Ai, . . ., An ∴D)
The reduction formula in line [1] corresponds to rule (I. 4), the reduction formula
in line [2] corresponds to basic rule (I. 3). The move from [2] to [3] depends merely
on substitutions, namely on the substitution (1) of C for B, (2) of Ak+1, . . ., An (with n
≧k + 1) for Ai, . . ., Ak, and (3) of Ai, . . ., Ak (with i ≧0 and k ≧1) for Cm, . . ., Cn.
The move to [4] is possible for the following reason: the same expression, ‘Ai, . . .,
Ak, C ∴D’, stands behind the sign ‘/’ in line [1], while it stands before that sign in line
[3]. This means that the expression may be replaced in [3] by the whole expression
which stands before the sign ‘/’ in [1]. The license for this replacement rests on the
transitivity of the relation of reducibility. The reduction formula is in this respect a
combination of the reduction formulas of lines [1] and [3].

rules and to logical rules derived from them.

General notice on notation:
I use the following abbreviations in proofs for the validity of rules which are not
metalogical rules:
All lines of the proof are designated with numerals in square brackets on the left
side. To the right of this designation, there is a symbolic expression which indicates
the schema either of a basic rule, a rule already proven as valid, or a provable rule.
If it is a basic rule or an already proven rule, then on the right side of the line there
is only the designation of its schema (e.g., ‘(I. 1)’, as in line [1] in the proof above for
(I. 6)). If it is a provable rule (or the rule to be proved), then on the right side of the
column there are two references. The first reference is the designation of a rule, ac-
cording to which the expression standing in the same line has been derived (e.g.,
(I. 2) as in line [2] of the above proof). The second reference, placed to the right, indi-
cates in square brackets either one or more of the preceding lines to whose formula
the mentioned rule has been applied. If more than one line is referenced, the line
numbers are placed together in square brackets.

(I. 4) [1, 2]
Scholium: The addition “(with A ≠N B, for arbitrary B)” appearing in (I. 1), (I. 6),
(I. 7), and (I. 8) prohibits erroneous substitutions. Thus a rule would be clearly
invalid which corresponded to the schema N B ∴NNN B (with B ≠N C for an
arbitrary C) and was gained from (I. 1) by substitution. Consider the case in
which there is an interpretation in which both B and N B are false. In this case,
N B is compatible with NN B. It is thus not impossible that N B is true but NNN B
false. Accordingly, NNN B does not follow logically from N B – assuming that
“logical consequence” is understood in the sense of § 43, def. 4.
If N B ∴NNN B yielded a valid rule, then on the basis of (I. 6) – as well as
(I. 4) – the validity of N B ∴N B would be provable. It is conceivable, however, as in
the case we have considered, that N B is compatible with NN B. Hence, it cannot be
true that N B follows logically from N B.
156
Part II Section One Rules for Deriving Rules

Since a rule of the form N B ∴N B is obviously invalid, it is also obvious that
a rule of the form A ∴A is invalid. In order to see this, we do not have to take the
indirect route of seeing the invalidity of N B ∴N B. Rather, we can see that the
expression ‘A ∴A’ is not a valid rule already from the fact that in this expression
there appear no logical constants on whose meaning could rest the logical conse-
quence (as according to § 43, def. 4) of A from A.
The reason why it is impossible that A is true as a premise but false as a con-
clusion can only consist in the fact that A gets an interpretation in the places of its
occurrence according to which A is incompatible with N A. However, nothing
forces us to regard this reason as a logical one, especially since it is already estab-
lished that there is an interpretation for A in which A equals N B and N B is com-
patible with NN B.
If there is a valid rule according to which a proposition follows from itself,
then it cannot express a logical but at best a regular consequence and take the form:
‘A  A’. Such a rule will be discussed further below (see § 72, scholium to rule (VI. 3)).
