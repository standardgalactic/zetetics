Preface
This book is an introduction to the theories of Special and General Relativity. The
target audience are physicists, engineers and applied scientists who are looking for
an understandable introduction to the topic—without too much new mathematics.
All necessary mathematical tools are provided either directly in the text or in
the appendices. Also the appendices contain an introduction to vector or matrices:
ﬁrst, as a refresher of known fundamental algebra, and second, to gain new experi-
ences, e.g. with the Kronecker-product of matrices and differentiation with respect
to vectors and matrices.
The fundamental equations of Einstein’s theory of Special and General Relativity
are derived using matrix calculus without the help of tensors. This feature makes the
book special and a valuable tool for scientists and engineers with no experience in
the ﬁeld of tensor calculus. But physicists are also discovering that Einstein’s vac-
uum ﬁeld equations can be expressed as a system of ﬁrst-order differential-matrix
equations, wherein the unknown quantity is a matrix. These matrix equations are
also easy to handle when implementing numerical algorithms using standard soft-
ware as, e.g. MATHEMATICA or MAPLE.
In Chap. 1, the foundations of Special Relativity are developed. Chapter 2 de-
scribes the structure and principles of General Relativity. Chapter 3 explains the
Schwarzschild solution of spherical body gravity and examines the “Black Hole”
phenomenon. Furthermore, two appendices summarize the basics of the matrix the-
ory and differential geometry.
After completion of the book, I discovered the paper [37], where Einstein’s equa-
tions of a similar shape are derived.
I would like to thank Claus Ascheron (Springer) who has made great effort to-
wards the publication of this book. Finally, I would like to thank my wife Renate,
without her this book would have never been published!

Chapter 1
Special Relativity
This chapter begins with the classical theorems of Galilei and Newton and the
Galilei transformation. The special theory of relativity, developed by Einstein in
1905, leads to the four-dimensional spacetime of Minkowski and the Lorentz trans-
formation. After that the relativity of simultaneity of events, the length contrac-
tion of moving bodies and the time dilation are discussed. This is followed by the
velocity-addition formula and relativistic mechanics. The next topic is the mass–
energy equivalence formula E = mc2, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.
Then relativistic electromagnetism is treated and the invariance of special forms
of the equations of dynamics and Maxwell’s electrodynamic with respect to the
Lorentz transformation is shown. The energy–momentum matrix is introduced and
discussed.
1.1 Galilei Transformation
1.1.1 Relativity Principle of Galilei
An event is anything that can happen in space and time, e.g. the emission of a ﬂash
of light in a room corner. Events happen at a single point. We assign to each event a
set of four coordinates t, x1,x2 and x3, or with t and the three-dimensional vector
x def
=
⎛
⎝
x1
x2
x3
⎞
⎠∈R3.
The position vector x and the time t form a reference frame X . In this frame, New-
ton’s fundamental law of mechanics has the form
dp
dt = f

(1.1)
An observer may now execute any motion, for example, he makes an experiment in
a moving train. We want to ﬁnd the equation that takes the place of
dp
dt = f
for the moving observer. A coordinate system X ′ is connected ﬁrmly with the mov-
ing observer; it should be axis-parallel to the original coordinate system X . xo is
the location of the origin of X ′ measured in X (Fig. 1.1). Then
x = xo + x′,
or
x′ = x −xo.
(1.2)
Here x is the position vector of the event measured by an observer at rest in the
reference system X , and x′ is what an observer measures in the moving reference
system X ′. Equation (1.2) differentiated with respect to time t,
dx′
dt = dx
dt −dxo
dt ,
(1.3)
results in the speed addition theorem of classical mechanics:
v′(t) = v(t) −v0(t).

For the acceleration one obtains
d2x′
dt2 = d2x
dt2 −d2xo
dt2 .
(1.4)
The force f acting on the mass m is independent of the chosen coordinate system,
so f ′ = f . This and (1.1) used in (1.4) result in
f ′ −md2xo
dt2 = md2x′
dt2 .
(1.5)
The fundamental law of mechanics has lost its validity! If the moving observer
knows the external force f ′, he can determine with measurements in X ′ his ac-
celeration with respect to the rest system X . However, if the motion of X ′ with
respect to X is uniform and rectilinear, i.e. xo = vot with a constant vo, then from
(1.5)
f ′ = md2x′
dt2
(1.6)
and the fundamental laws of mechanics have in X ′ the same form as in X . Such
a uniform and rectilinear moving coordinate system is called an inertial system.
The moving observer has no possibility to determine his own motion with respect
to the coordinate system X by a mechanical experiment. Any free particle moves
in a straight line with constant speed. For example, Galilei considered a uniformly
moving ship in a port, whose occupants cannot decide whether the ship moves with
respect to the port or whether the port moves with respect to the ship. Today as an
example one would take a train in a railway station. This is the Relativity Principle
of Galilei:
Axiom: All natural laws are the same at every moment in all inertial
systems.
All coordinate systems moving uniformly linearly with respect
to an inertial system are themselves inertial systems.

Special Relativity
If two reference systems X and X ′ move with a constant velocity v against each
other (Fig. 1.2), then
x′ = x −vt
and
t′ = t.
(1.7)
With the four-dimensional column vector
⃗x def
=
 t
x

∈R4
the two equations (1.7) can be summarized in one equation, and we get the Galilei
transformation in a matrix form
⃗x′ =

1
oT
−v
I

⃗x = T Galilei⃗x.
(1.8)
Looking at the inverse transformation of X ′ to X , one gets
t = t′
and
x = vt + x′,
or
⃗x =

1
oT
v
I

⃗x′ = T ′
Galilei⃗x′.
If both transformations are applied in series, the result is
T GalileiT ′
Galilei⃗x′ =

⃗x′ =

⃗x′ = ⃗x′,
i.e. the matrix T ′
Galilei is the inverse of the matrix T Galilei.
For the time derivatives of the four-vector ⃗x we obtain
d⃗x

With ⃗f def

we can write the fundamental equation of mechanics

This equation multiplied from the left with the transformation matrix T Galilei, in
fact, gives back the same form:

Galilei Transformation
5
The fundamental equation of dynamics is thus invariant with respect to this Galilei
transformation, i.e. it retains its shape regardless of the reference system.
1.1.2 General Galilei Transformation
Up to this point, the Galilei transformation was considered only under the uniform
motion with the speed v of the two inertial systems against each other and a ﬁxed
initial time to = 0, a ﬁxed initial point x0 = 0 of the new coordinate system X ′ and
with no rotation of the coordinate system.
It is now generally assumed that all laws of nature remain constant, therefore, are
invariant with respect to time shifting. If x(t) is a solution of m¨x = f , then for all
to ∈R is x(t + to) also a solution.
Next, it is assumed that the considered spaces are homogeneous, thus the same
features are available at all points. So, if x(t) is again a solution of m¨x = f , then
x(t) + b is also a solution, but now for the starting point x0 + b.
Moreover, it is assumed that the considered spaces are isotropic, i.e. there is no
directional dependence of properties. So again, if x(t) is a solution of m¨x = f , then
also Dx(t) is a solution for the initial state Dx0. Here, however, also the equality
of the distances
ρ(x1,x2) = ρ(Dx1,Dx2)
must be true. For the rotation matrix D this means that it must be orthogonal be-
cause
ρ(Dx1,Dx2) =

(Dx2 −Dx1)⊺(Dx2 −Dx1)
=

(x2 −x1)⊺D⊺D(x2 −x1) != ρ(x1,x2)
=

(x2 −x1)⊺(x2 −x1),
so
D⊺D != I.
The time invariance, homogeneity and isotropy can be summarized in one trans-
formation, the general Galilei transformation, as follows:
If t′ is shifted versus t by t0, i.e. one has
t′ = t0 + t,
(1.11)
furthermore, the new coordinate system relative to the old is moved by x0 and ro-
tated by the rotation matrix D, so for v = 0 one gets
x′ = Dx + x0,

By moving the origin of the new coordinate system with the velocity v as mentioned

(1.16)
Newton’s fundamental laws are invariant also with respect to such a transforma-
tion. A general Galilei transformation is determined by 10 parameters: to, xo ∈R3,
v ∈R3 and D ∈R3×3. The rotation matrix D, in fact, has only three main param-
eters since any general rotation consists of successive rotations performed around
the x1-, x2- and x3-axis, so the whole rotation is characterized by the three angles
ϕ1,ϕ2 and ϕ3, where, for example, the rotation around the x1-axis is achieved by
the matrix
⎛

1.1.3 Maxwell’s Equations and Galilei Transformation
The situation is completely different with Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetic
dynamics. They are not invariant with respect to a Galilei transformation! Indeed,
in an inertial system X , a static charge q generates only a static electric ﬁeld; in an
inertial frame, moving with the speed v, qv is an electric current which generates
there a magnetic ﬁeld!

1.2
Lorentz Transformation
7
In the nineteenth century, it was believed that all physical phenomena are me-
chanical and electromagnetic forces could be traced to the stress states of a world-
aether, the Maxwell’s tensions. It was assumed that even a vacuum must be ﬁlled
with aether. This aether then is the carrier of the electromagnetic phenomena.
Suppose an inertial frame is a reference system in which Galilei’s principle of
inertia is valid. Then Einstein in his general relativity principle claims:
The laws of nature take on the same form in all inertial
systems.
For the fundamental law of mechanics, this is derived above. The principle of rela-
tivity applies neither to electrodynamics nor to optics. How should the basic equa-
tions of electrodynamics be modiﬁed so that the relativity principle is valid? This is
the content of Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity. He expanded it in the Theory
of General Relativity. This theory treats how the natural laws must be modiﬁed so
that they are also valid in accelerating or not uniformly against each other moving
reference systems.
1.2 Lorentz Transformation
1.2.1 Introduction
At the end of the nineteenth century, experiments were conceived which should
determine the velocity of the Earth with respect to the resting cosmic aether. This
speed relative to the aether can only be measured by an electromagnetic effect, e.g.
the light wave propagation. But in the Michelson–Morley experiment in 1881 and
1887 no drift velocity was found. Einstein concluded:1
The speed of light c is always constant.
Independently of the movement of the light source and the observer, light has the
same speed value in every inertial frame.
Assume a light pulse is produced at time t = t′ = 0 in the two axis-parallel refer-
ence systems X and X ′ with a common origin. If the light spreads with the speed of
light c in the reference system X ′, then, for example, it is true that x′
1 = c · t. From
(1.7) it follows for the x1-direction that if v has the x1-directional component, then
x1 = x′
1 + vt = (c + v)t,
yielding, contrary to the Michelson–Morley experiment, a propagation velocity for
light of c + v > c. Therefore, a transformation must be valid, different from the
Galilei transformation. We try a linear transformation:
t = f t′ + e⊺x′,
(1.17)
1c from Latin celeritas: speed.

1.2.2 Determining the Components of the Transformation Matrix
That t′ is different from t (according to Galilei this was not the case, he took t′ = t)
is shown by the following reasoning. We consider two observers; observer A moves
relative to the observer B in a spaceship with velocity v (Fig. 1.3). The spaceship
with observer A has the inertial system X ′, and the observer B on Earth has the
inertial system X . A beam of light moves from the origin x = x′ = o of the reference
systems X and X ′ at time t = t′ = 0 perpendicular to the velocity v and reaches
after t′ seconds for the observer A in the moving reference system X ′ a mirror
moving also with the reference system X ′. For the observer B in the stationary
reference system X , the light beam reaches the mirror, which has been moved in
the v direction a distance of v · t after t seconds. Since in all initial systems the
speed of light is constant and equal to c, by Pythagorean theorem, one has
(ct)2 = (vt)2 + (L)2 = (vt)2 +


or, after solving for t,
t = γ t′
(1.19)

(1.20)
A comparison of (1.19) with (1.17) provides for x′ = o
f = γ .
(1.21)
For x′ = o one has x = vt, and from (1.18) it follows that x = bt′. Thus, bt′ = vt,
i.e. b = v t
t′ . From (1.19) it follows, on the other hand, that t
t′ = γ , so
b = γ v.
(1.22)
Up to now, the following transformation equations were determined:
t = γ t′ + e⊺x′,
(1.23)
x = γ vt′ + Ax′.
(1.24)
Equations (1.23) and (1.24) deliver a transformation of X ′ to X . If one wants to
invert this transformation, one must replace v by −v, x by x′, and vice versa, and t
by t′ and vice versa (as A and e may depend on v, in the following we ﬁrst write ˜A
and ˜e):
t′ = γ t + ˜e⊺x,
x′ = −γ vt + ˜Ax,
which can be combined to
⃗x′ =
 γ
˜e⊺
−γ v
˜A

⃗x def

(1.25)
Both transformations performed one after another must result in the identity matrix:

For the top left (1,1)-element of the matrix product ˆL

Hence,

(1.27)
Taking for e

and using (1.27) yields

Thus, till now we have calculated:

Suppose now that in (1.25) we have ˜A = A. Then for the matrix element in the

c2 v2 = γ 2 −1.
Plugging this into (1.31) provides
A2 = I +

(1.32)
Since (γ −1)2 = γ 2 −2(γ −1) −1, for γ 2 −1 one can write
γ 2 −1 = (γ −1)2 + 2(γ −1).
(1.33)

1.2

Equation (1.33) inserted into (1.32) yields

A = I + (γ −1)vv⊺
v2 .
(1.34)
It is, in fact, true that A(−v) = A(v), i.e. the above assumption that ˜A = A is cor-
rect.
Thus, the matrix ˆL of the Lorentz transformation is determined completely as
ˆL =

For c →∞we get γ = 1 and the Lorentz transformation turns into the Galilei

In the often in the textbooks treated special case when the velocity v is towards
the x1-axis, i.e.

1.2.3 Simultaneity at Different Places
It will be seen that events at different places which are simultaneous for an observer
in X are not in general simultaneous for a moving observer in X ′. This is caused by
the ﬁnite speed of light. The reference system X ′ may move towards the stationary
reference system X with velocity v. If the two events E1 and E2 in X have the
coordinates ⃗x1 and ⃗x2, then they are simultaneous if t1 = t2. Do these two events
then happen also at the same time for an observer in the reference system X ′? Due
to (1.37),
ct′
1 = γ ct1 −γ
c v⊺x1
and
ct′
2 = γ ct2 −γ
c v⊺x2.
Dividing both equations by c and subtracting one from another yields
t′
1 −t′
2 = γ (t1 −t2) −γ
c2 v⊺(x1 −x2),
so
t′
2 −t′
1 = γ
c2 v⊺(x1 −x2).
The events ⃗x′
1 and ⃗x′
2 are also simultaneous only if the velocity v is perpendicular
to the local difference x1 −x2. Conclusion:

1.2
Lorentz Transformation
13
Fig. 1.4 Simultaneity
Events at different locations, which in the reference system X are simulta-
neous, need not be simultaneous when seen from the reference system X ′.
Example For the special case v = [v,0,0]⊺one only needs to consider the ct- and
the x-coordinate (Minkowski diagram, Fig. 1.4). The Lorentz transformation does
not change the x2- and x3-component. It is therefore possible to restrict the consid-
eration to the two-dimensional transformations:

c v(x1 −x2) ̸= 0,
if v ̸= 0 and x1 ̸= x2, i.e. in the moving reference system X ′ the two events E1 and
E2 are no longer simultaneous.
1.2.4 Length Contraction of Moving Bodies
Einstein (1905) was the ﬁrst who completely demonstrated that length contrac-
tion is an effect due to the change in the notions of space, time and simultaneity
brought about by special relativity. Length contraction can simply be derived from

14

the Lorentz transformation. Let the reference system X be stationary and the refer-
ence system X ′ moving towards it with the speed v. A yardstick has in the stationary
system the two endpoints x1 and x2. Its resting length is
l0 = x2 −x1,
(1.40)
i.e.
l2
0 = (x2 −x1)⊺(x2 −x1).
(1.41)
At time t′, the endpoints of the yardstick in the moving reference system X ′ have
the coordinates x′
1 and x′
2. With (1.38) we obtain
l0 = x2 −x1 = A

x′

(1.42)
It follows that

(1.44)
In the product v⊺l′, only the component l′
∥of l′ parallel to the velocity v comes into
effect, i.e. it is true that v⊺l′ = v⊺l′
∥. Thus,
l2
0 = l′2 +

so

(1.45)
Since always γ 2 −1 ≥0, it follows from (1.45) that
l′ ≤l0.
(1.46)
The result of the yardstick length measurement therefore depends on the reference
system in which the length measurement was made.
If the yardstick is parallel to the velocity v, then l′ = l′
∥and (1.45) becomes
γ l′ = l0, or
l′ = l0
γ = l0

1 −v2
c2 ,
(1.47)
i.e. as v →c one gets l′ →0. For example, if the velocity is v = 0.8c (i.e. 80 % of
the speed of light), then the length is l′ = 0.6lo.

1.2.5 Time Dilation
Time dilation is an actual difference of elapsed time between two events as measured
by observers moving relative to each other. Using (1.19), it is
t = γ t′,
(1.48)
where
γ =
1

1 −v2
c2
≥1.
Let t′ be the time of a light clock, measured by an observer in the moving inertial
frame X ′ after covering the distance between the mirrors. Then t is the time required
for the light to cover the distance between the two mirrors of the moving clock,
which is measured by an observer at rest in X . The faster the clock moves, i.e. the
greater v is, the longer this time. If, for example, for the moving observer t′ = 1
second is elapsed, for the stationary observer t = γ ≥1 seconds have passed. If v so
large that γ = 20, then, for example, for the stationary observer t = 20 years have
passed, and for the moving observer only t′ = 1 year is gone!
Twin Paradox
There are two twins A and B on Earth. A starts in a rocket and ﬂies
away with high speed, while B stays on Earth. During the ﬂight, A is aging more
slowly than B. After some time the rocket is slowed down and returns with A at high
speed back to Earth. During the ﬂight A has aged less than B, which remained at rest
on Earth, Fig. 1.5. Now comes the paradox: The velocities are relative! One could
take also the twin A in its entrained coordinate system as stationary and consider B
as moving with large speeds. That’s right; but one key difference is that the twin A
is not always in the same uniformly moving inertial frame since, at the turning point
where the return begins, the inertial system changes! This is not the case for B. He
always stays in the same inertial frame. Therefore, there is no paradox.
1.3 Invariance of the Quadratic Form
The Michelson–Morley experiment says that in any reference system the light prop-
agates in all directions at the same speed c. If at the origin x = o of X a ﬂash of
light is ignited, it propagates with the speed of light c spherically. After the time t,
the light signal reaches all points of the sphere of radius ct. To points on the sphere
applies:
x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3 = (ct)2,
i.e.
(ct)2 −x2
1 −x2
2 −x2
3 = 0.
(1.49)
If the origins of the two reference systems X and X ′ at the ignition time t = t′ = 0
of the light ﬂash are at the same space point x(t = 0) = X′(t′ = 0) = o, the light in

the reference system X ′ is also spreading according to the following law:

ct′2 −x′2
1 −x′2
2 −x′2
3 = 0.
(1.50)
So this quantity is invariant.
One can imagine (1.49) generated by the quadratic form
⃗x⊺M ⃗x = 0,
(1.51)
with the Minkowski matrix
M def

and the four-dimensional vector

Minkowski was the ﬁrst who represented Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity
using four-dimensional spacetime vectors.

1.3
Invariance of the Quadratic Form
17
1.3.1 Invariance with Respect to Lorentz Transformation
Now the invariance of the quadratic form (1.51) to a Lorentz transformation is ex-
amined. If ⃗x′ = L⃗x, then
⃗x′⊺M ⃗x′ = ⃗x⊺L⊺ML⃗x.
(1.52)
Then for the matrix product L⊺ML with the help of (1.31) and (1.34) one obtains
L⊺ML =

= M.
So for the quadratic forms, in fact, the following is valid:
⃗x′⊺M ⃗x′ = ⃗x⊺M ⃗x,
i.e. they are invariant with respect to a Lorentz transformation!
When dealing with the quadratic form, the propagation of light was considered
till now. For this the quadratic form ⃗x⊺M ⃗x is equal to zero. Considering, however,
the movement of a particle, the light will spread faster than the particle, i.e. it will
always be true that
(ct)2 > x⊺x
or
(ct)2 −x⊺x = ⃗x⊺M ⃗x > 0.
If we denote by x the travelled way between two events and the elapsed time by
t, we will obtain the four-dimensional spacetime interval s from
s2 = ⃗x⊺M⃗x.
(1.53)
The “distance” s between the two events is an invariant interval in the four-
dimensional spacetime. Since the right-hand side of (1.53) is invariant with respect
to a Lorentz transformation, s is independent of the chosen inertial frame, it has
always the same length. So the theory of relativity does not relativise everything!
s2 is negative when the distance ⃗x is so big that no light signal can traverse the
distance in ﬁnite time. This possibility will be examined in the following section.
1.3.2 Light Cone
A ﬂash of light at time t0 = 0 is spreading spherically in the three-dimensional space
with the speed of light c. At the time t1 > t0, the light has reached the surface of a

18
1
Special Relativity
Fig. 1.6 Light propagation
sphere of radius r1 = ct1. At time t2 > t1, a spherical surface with a larger radius
r2 = ct2 is reached, and so forth as shown in Fig. 1.6. In this two-dimensional image,
the light wave through space is illustrated by a circle that expands with the speed
of light. One can implement this movement of light waves in a space–time diagram
in which the time coordinate ct is vertical and two of the three spatial coordinates,
e.g. x1 and x2, are displayed horizontally (Fig. 1.7). Due to the fact that the time
coordinate is represented by the time t multiplied by the speed of light c, the photons
move in straight lines on this diagram, which are sloped at 45◦. For photons the
possible paths are in an open top cone whose walls have a slope of 45◦. The speed
of a moving particle is always less than the speed of light, therefore the path must
always be run within the light cone with a slope which is always less than 45◦to the
time axis.
Fig. 1.7 Light cone

1.3
Invariance of the Quadratic Form
19
The photons which reach the point E at a time before t0 = 0, e.g. in the time
interval of t−1 < t0, all come from a ball of radius ct−1 = r−1, etc. Altogether we
obtain again a cone as in Fig. 1.7, the cone of the events which can reach the event
E, i.e. these events are observable from E.
In the Minkowski spacetime of special relativity, in any event the light cones are
aligned in parallel; the central axes of all light cones are parallel to the time axis. In
the general theory of relativity, this is no longer always the case due to the curvature
of space, i.e. the central axes of the light cones are not always parallel to the time
axis.
1.3.3 Proper Time
If one looks at a completely arbitrarily moving clock from any inertial frame, then
one can interpret this movement as uniform at any instant of time. If we introduce
a coordinate system which is permanently connected to the clock, then this is again
an inertial frame. In the inﬁnitesimal time interval dt, measured with the clock of
the observer in the inertial system X , the moving clock covers a distance of (dx2
1 +
dx2
2 + dx2
3)1/2. In the inertial system X ′, permanently connected to the clock, the
clock does not move, so dx′
1 = dx′
2 = dx′
3 = 0, but the elapsed displayed time is dt′.
The invariant quadratic form
ds2 = d⃗x⊺M d⃗x = d⃗x′⊺M d⃗x′
computed for
d⃗x⊺= [c dt,dx1,dx2,dx3]
and
d⃗x′⊺=

c dt′,0,0,0

gives
ds2 = c2 dt2 −dx2

The proper time interval of a moving mass is due to (1.55) and (1.56) always smaller
than the time interval in the stationary system. In general, the proper time of a mov-
ing mass is called τ instead of t′. Due to (1.54), the proper time is thus
dτ = ds/c.

1.4 Relativistic Velocity Addition
1.4.1 Galilean Addition of Velocities
Galilei observed that if a ship is moving relative to the shore at velocity v, and a
sailor is moving with velocity u measured on the ship, calculating the velocity of
the sailor measured on the shore is what is meant by the addition of the velocities v
and u. When both the sailor and the ship are moving slowly compared to light, it is
accurate enough to use the vector sum
w = v + u
where w is the velocity of the sailor relative to the shore.
Consider the two inertial systems X and X ′ in Fig. 1.8. The reference system X ′
is moving with respect to the other reference system X with the velocity v. Suppose

1.4
Relativistic Velocity Addition
21
that the vector x′ describes the motion of a point P in the inertial system X ′, and this
point is moving with respect to the reference system X ′ with the velocity u = dx′
dt′ .
What is the speed w def
= dx
dt of the point P relative to the reference system X ?
It is
w = dx
dt = dx
dt′
 dt
dt′

−1
.
(1.58)
Between ⃗x and ⃗x′ the relationship ⃗x′ = L(v)⃗x holds, or, solving for ⃗x,
⃗x = L−1(v)⃗x′.
(1.59)
In detail,
t = γvt′ + γv
c2 v⊺x′,
(1.60)
x = x′ + (γv −1)v⊺x′
v2 v + γvvt′.
(1.61)
From (1.60) follows
dt
dt′ = γv + γv
c2 v⊺dx′
dt′ = γv

1 + v⊺u
c2

,
(1.62)
and from (1.61)
dx
dt′ = dx′
dt′ + (γv −1)vv⊺
v2
dx′
dt′ + γvv
= u + (γv −1)v⊺u
v2 v + γvv.
(1.63)
Equations (1.62) and (1.63) used in (1.58) provide
w =
v + 1
γv u + (1 −1
γv ) v⊺u
v2 v
1 + v⊺u
c2
,
(1.64)
or, after addition of u −u = o in the numerator,
w =
v + u + ( 1
γv −1)(u −v⊺u
v2 v)
1 + v⊺u
c2
.
(1.65)
So this is the speed of the point P with respect to the reference system X . For a
double vectorial product one has
a × (b × c) =

a⊺c

b −

a⊺b

c.
(1.66)

22

Special Relativity
This allows one to transform the last parenthesis in the numerator of (1.65) as fol-
lows:
u −v⊺u
v2 v = v⊺v
v2 u −v⊺u
v2 v = 1
v2

v × (u × v)

,
i.e. instead of (1.65) one can also write
w =
v + u + 1
v2 ( 1
γv −1)(v × (u × v))
1 + v⊺u
c2
.
(1.67)
If the two velocities v and u are parallel, then v × u = o and from (1.67) it is clear
that the sum of the two velocities is
w = v + u
1 + v⊺u
c2
.
(1.68)
If, in contrast, the two velocities v and u are perpendicular to each other, then
v⊺u = o and from (1.65) it follows that the sum of the two velocities is
w = v + 1
γv
u.
(1.69)
In a further special case which is almost exclusively treated in textbooks and
in which both the vector u and the vector v have only one component in the
x1-direction, i.e.
u =
⎛
⎝
u1
0
0
⎞
⎠
and
v =

one has w2 = w3 = 0 and
w1 = v1 + u1
1 + u1v1

1.5 Lorentz Transformation of the Velocity
How does one write the basic laws of mechanics so that they remain invariant under
a Lorentz transformation? We start from the transformation equation


using a Lorentz transformation matrix! For this to be the case, the deﬁ-
nition of the velocity has to be modiﬁed. For this purpose, a short interim statement:
The second block row of (1.73) provides
u′ =
1
γ (1 −v⊺u
c2 )(Au −γ v).
Taking the scalar product of this vector with itself, we obtain

(1.78)
The thus modiﬁed new velocity vector
⃗u def
= γu
 c
u

(1.79)
now is transformed by a Lorentz transformation L into the velocity vector ⃗u′:
⃗u′ = L⃗u.
(1.80)
The so-deﬁned velocity ⃗u is much better suited for the formulation of physics laws,
as they have the same shape in every inertial frame. With u this would not be the

1.6
Momentum and Its Lorentz Transformation
25
case. For clariﬁcation we re-emphasize that a particle or a focal point moves with
the velocity u in an inertial system X ′, which itself moves or can move at the speed
v with respect to another reference system. That is the difference between u and v!
By the way, the quadratic form for the velocity
⃗u⊺M ⃗u = γ 2
u c2 −γ 2
u u⊺u =
c4
c2 −u2 −
c2u2
c2 −u2 = c2
(1.81)
is, of course, invariant with respect to a Lorentz transformation because—as one can
easily show—even ⃗u′⊺M ⃗u′ = c2 holds.
In (1.57), the proper time dτ = 1
c ds was introduced. We have
ds2 = ⃗x⊺M ⃗x = c2 dt2 −x⊺x = c2 dt2

or with γu = (1 −u2

2
dt = γu dτ.
(1.82)
This is the same relationship as in the time dilation in (1.73). τ is therefore the time
that a comoving clock displays, while t is the time that an observer at rest measures.
However, the moving clock must no longer move rectilinearly and uniformly!
In (1.79), one has u = dx
dt . Replacing dt by (1.82) in it gives u = 1
γu
dx
dτ , or equiv-
alently, γuu = dx
dτ . Furthermore,
d⃗x =

so
d⃗x
dτ =

(1.83)
When the trajectory in spacetime is parameterized by the proper time τ, ⃗x = ⃗x(τ),
then ⃗u = d⃗x
dτ is the four-velocity along the trajectory.
1.6 Momentum and Its Lorentz Transformation

(1.88)
is invariant with respect to a Lorentz transformation because also ⃗p′⊺M ⃗p′ = m2

1.7 Acceleration and Force

The acceleration is generally deﬁned as the time derivative of speed. Differentiating

and ⃗u = d⃗x/dτ one can write for (1.97)
⃗a = d⃗u
dτ = d2⃗x
dτ 2 .
(1.98)
The vector ⃗a is also obtained using (1.91) and (1.92) as

(1.99)
If ⃗u⊺M ⃗u = c2 is differentiated with respect to the proper time τ, we obtain
d⃗u⊺
dτ M ⃗u + ⃗u⊺M d⃗u
dτ = 2⃗u⊺M d⃗u
dτ = 2⃗u⊺M⃗a = 0,
i.e. the two four-dimensional vectors ⃗u and M⃗a are orthogonal in R4!
For each point of time of an arbitrarily accelerated motion, one can always spec-
ify a reference system X ′ which is an inertial system, named “local inertial system”.
We obtain the corresponding Lorentz transformation by selecting L(u) as the trans-
formation matrix. Then, with

1.7.2 Equation of Motion and Force
The relativistic equation of motion for a particle has to be Lorentz-invariant, and, in
the inertial system of the considered particle, Newton’s equation of motion has to
be true:
m0
du
dt = f ∈R3.
(1.100)

1.7
Acceleration and Force
29
Let the accompanying inertial system be X . Furthermore, suppose X ′ is the inertial
system which moves relative to X with the constant speed u(t0). The particle rests
momentarily at time t = t0 in X ′. The equation of motion (1.100) refers to a point
of time and its neighbourhood. For this neighbourhood, t = t0 ± dt is the desired
arbitrary small speed in X ′. For speeds v ≪c we have (1.100). Hence in X ′
m0
du′
dt′ = f ′ ∈R3
(1.101)
also holds exactly. From (1.101), the relativistic equations of motion in an arbitrary
reference system may be derived. In (1.101), m0 is the rest mass and f ′ the three-
dimensional force in X ′. Expand the vector f ′ in (1.101) to a four-vector and call
the result ⃗f
′:
m0

 c

(1.102)
Thus ⃗f
′ is speciﬁed in the resting system X ′. In the inertial system X , in which the
mass particle moves with the velocity u, ⃗f is obtained by a Lorentz transformation
with L(−u):
⃗f = L(−u)

i.e.

according to (1.103) and (1.104),

1.7.3 Energy and Rest Mass
Equation (1.107) multiplied with c/γu provides
d
dt

muc2
= u⊺f .
(1.109)
In (1.109), u⊺f is the instantaneous power. This is the work per unit of time, done
by the force f . So the left-hand side of (1.109) must be the temporal change of
energy, i.e. muc2 = γum0c2 is energy. We obtain for the relativistic energy the most
renowned formula of the theory of relativity:
E = muc2.
(1.110)
When u = o, i.e. when the particle is at rest, γu = 1, and
E0 = m0c2
(1.111)
is the “rest energy”, Einstein’s famous formula. Weinberg says in [36] about the
content of this formula: “If some mass is destroyed (as in radioactive decay or fu-
sion, or ﬁssion), then very large quantities of kinetic energy will be liberated, with
consequences of well-known importance.”
The four-dimensional momentum vector ⃗p is then recognised as the combination
of energy and momentum:
⃗p =
E/c
p

.
(1.112)
For the quadratic form in (1.88)
⃗p⊺M ⃗p = m2
0c2
we now obtain
⃗p⊺M ⃗p =

E/c,p⊺E/c

1.7
Acceleration and Force
31
i.e.
E =

m0c22 + p2c2.
(1.113)
For high velocities the momentum term p2c2 dominates here: E = pc as for neutri-
nos and particles in accelerators (CERN). For small velocities u ≪c, we may use
the approximation
E ≈m0c2 + 1
2m0u2.
The ﬁrst term is the rest energy E0. The second term is the classical kinetic energy
Ekin. The relativistic kinetic energy is
Ekin = E −m0c2 = (γu −1)m0c2.
(1.114)
If v →c, then Ekin →∞. Equation (1.114) gives a reason why mass particles can-
not be accelerated up to the velocity of light!
1.7.4 Emission of Energy
A body, at rest in X ′ with the rest mass m0,before, radiates at a certain time the energy
E′
Emission in form of light or heat radiation. This radiation is emitted symmetrically
so that the total momentum of the radiated energy in X ′ is zero, i.e. the body remains
at rest during the radiation process. The energy–momentum vector of the radiation
in X ′ is therefore
⎛
⎜⎜⎝
1
cE′
Emission
0
0
0
⎞
⎟⎟⎠.
(1.115)
Compared with the inertial system X , the body is moving with the velocity v. In this
inertial system, the total momentum is equal to the momentum of the body pbefore =
γum0,beforeu. After radiation, the body has the momentum pafter = γum0,afteru, and
the momentum of radiation is calculated using (1.115) with the Lorentz transforma-
tion L(−u) from X ′ to X :
⃗p = L(−u)
⎛

⎟⎟⎠=

.
During the emission of radiation, the body has given away the momentum
γuu 1
c2 E′
Emission, without changing its speed. This is only possible because the body

32
1
Special Relativity
has changed its rest mass! Because of the momentum conservation law, one has
γum0,beforeu = γum0,afteru + γuu 1
c2 E′
Emission.
It follows that
m0,after = m0,before −1
c2 E′
Emission.
(1.116)
In Einstein’s words: “If a body emits the energy E′ in the form of radiation, its mass
is reduced by E′/c2.”

This form has a great advantage of being invariant when transitioning to another
reference system by a Lorentz transformation, i.e. in every inertial system its keeps
the same external form. But the quantities appearing in it take different values in
each reference system. This is shown in the following.

(1.143)
One gets the same result for e′ and b′ by a Lorentz transformation of F E,b!

and

The decomposition of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in an electric and magnetic ﬁeld
has no absolute signiﬁcance. If there exists, for example, in a reference system X
a purely electrostatic ﬁeld with b = o, then, due to (1.143), a magnetic ﬁeld b′ =
γ
c v × e ̸= o exists in a reference system X ′ that moves with the speed v relative to
the reference system X . Physically this means that all charges rest in X . But these
charges move relative to X ′ with the velocity v. So there exists a current in X ′ which
generates a magnetic ﬁeld in X ′.

The symmetric 6 × 6-matrix P (v) occurring in (1.144) has a formal similarity with

It is, of course, true that P (−v) = P −1(v), for, with
V 2

(1.145)
one obtains easily P (v)P (−v) = I.
In the special case when only one component of the velocity vector in the x-

invariant with respect to a Lorentz transformation!
Using a slightly long calculation, one can show that the difference of the squares
of the ﬁeld intensities is also invariant:
b′2 −e′2 = b2 −e2.

magnetic ﬁeld when no magnetic ﬁeld is present. But then also b = o, i.e. s = o,
and thus the whole equation is without a statement. The matter would be different
if instead of e2 in top left corner of the matrix T b,e, one would have the expression
(e2 + b2)/2, as then

namely, the temporal change of the energy density w = (e2 + b2)/2 of the elec-

(e2 + b2)/2! Therefore, now the

This equation expresses the fact that in the theory of relativity energy and momen-
tum are the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector ⃗p. They preserve this

zeroth component is always the time component and the rest represents the space
components.
We now go over to a distributed matter, such as that in a perfect ﬂuid, i.e. a liq-
uid without internal friction, but of quite variable density. It is described by the two
scalar ﬁelds, density ρ and pressure p, and the velocity vector ﬁeld ⃗u. The aim of
this derivation of the energy–momentum matrix is that this matrix somehow repre-
sents the energy content of the liquid and the transition to the curved world of the
theory of general relativity, which can serve as a source of the ﬁeld of gravity. The
continuity equation describes the conservation of mass. The conservation of mass
requires that the change of mass dV δρ/δt in the unit of time, associated with the
local compression δρ/δt, must be equal to the difference between the entering and
exiting masses per unit of time. In the x-direction, for this difference the following
is valid:
ρux(x) · dy · dz −

ρux + ∂ρux
∂x

dy dz = −∂ρux

dV.
One gets similar expressions for the y- and z-direction, making a total for the con-
servation of mass

∂t + div(ρu) = 0.
(1.172)
The dynamic behaviour is described by the Euler’s equation. By using Newton’s
law on the mass contained in a volume element of a perfect ﬂuid, we obtain the
Euler equation of motion, initially only in the x-direction:

e.g. the gravitational force. Using the total differential of ux,

(1.175)
This is the Euler’s equation in modern form. The ﬁrst term in the parentheses is
called the local and the second the convective change.
The relativistic generalization of the hydrodynamic equations (1.172) and (1.175)
will now be established. ρ0 is the rest density, deﬁned as the rest mass per rest
volume. With ⃗x⊺= [ct|x⊺] and ⃗u⊺= γu[c|u⊺], the Euler’s equation (1.175) can
also be written as
ρ ∂u
∂⃗x⊺⃗u = f D −gradp.
(1.176)
With regard to the subsequent application of the operator ⃗∇, we now start for the
energy–momentum matrix with
T mech,1
def
= ρ0⃗u⃗u⊺.
(1.177)
This matrix is symmetric and built up from the two values ρ0 and ⃗u, which describe
completely the dynamics of a perfect ﬂuid with the pressure p and the acting ex-
ternal forces f D. For the use of the operator ⃗∇and the further investigation of the
result, it is advantageous to ﬁrst divide the matrix T mech,1 similarly as the matrix

(1.178)
In a liquid moving with the velocity u, the volume decreases with γu while the mass
increases with γu, thus one obtains the total density ρ = γ 2

(1.180)
The term inside the ﬁrst parentheses is equal to zero, due to the continuity equation
in the non-relativistic case, and the term in the second parentheses contains the
force- and pressure-free Euler’s equation!
The pressure p must now be incorporated. Presuppose an isotropic liquid, then
the pressure p is direction-independent. In the Euler’s equation, the pressure appears
in the form of gradp which can be written as
grad p =

makes sense:

1.9.3 The Total Energy–Momentum Matrix
The derived energy–momentum matrices include the conservation laws of energy
and momentum of a closed system. For example, if a force density f D acts from the
outside on the ﬂuid, so that an electromagnetic ﬁeld acts on the electrically charged
liquid, then
f D = −T b,e ⃗∇= T mech ⃗∇,
(1.186)
or combined,
T total
def
= (T mech + T b,e),
(1.187)
so
T total ⃗∇= f total.
(1.188)
The conservation laws now apply to the whole system, which is ﬂuid plus the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Since the individual matrices are symmetric, the total energy–
momentum matrix T total is symmetric. If there are other components in the con-
sidered system, they can be incorporated in the symmetric total energy–momentum
matrix T total in a similar way as described above, and one obtains (1.188). This form
of mathematical representation of the dynamic behaviour of physical systems will
play a major role in the main equations of Einstein’s theory of General Relativity!

with the following (see (1.39)) equations:

In (1.65), we derived the relativistic velocity addition:
w =

If the two velocities v and u are parallel, then (see (1.68))

we obtain the relativistic generalization of the hydrodynamic equations

Remark The operator ⃗∇was somewhat unusual in the above formulas—it was writ-
ten to the right to the approaching object, e.g. in T mech ⃗∇. This was done so that
column vectors appear on both sides of the equation. The usual order would be if
one transposes the eligible equations. Then there would be row vectors on the left-
and on the right-hand side, and the operators, though provided with a transpose sign,
would have their usual place as, e.g. in
⃗∇
⊺T mech = ⃗f
⊺
D.
(Since the matrix T mech is symmetric, it need not be transposed.)

Chapter 2
Theory of General Relativity
The chapter begins with the introduction of the metric matrix G and the effect of a
homogeneous ﬁeld of gravitation on a mass particle. Then the motion on geodesic
lines in a gravitational ﬁeld is considered. The general transformation of coordi-
nates leads to the Christoffel matrix and the Riemannian curvature matrix. With the
help of the Ricci matrix, the Theory of General Relativity of Einstein can then be
formulated.
2.1 General Relativity and Riemannian Geometry
In the theory of general relativity, the invariance of the equations with respect to
any coordinate transformation is required. Especially the theorems of physics are to
remain unchanged if one transforms them from one coordinate system in another
coordinate system by the general transformation equations
xi = xi

for i = 0,1,2 and 3.
(2.1)
Consider an arbitrary coordinate system K on the inﬁnitely small neighbourhood of
the point P , in which also a ﬁeld of gravity may be present. In an inﬁnitely small
space and an inﬁnitely small time interval, or in other words, in an inﬁnitely small
spacetime interval, the coordinate system K can be replaced by a coordinate system
K′ which is accelerated to it and in which no ﬁeld of gravitation is present. K′ is
the local spacetime coordinate system in the neighbourhood of a point, and K the
general coordinate system. It is now assumed that
For all local coordinate systems K′ the Special Relativity is valid in any in-
ﬁnitely small four-dimensional neighbourhood.
The point P ′ may be inﬁnitely close to the point P , and have the real coordinates
dx0,dx1,dx2 and dx3 in the Cartesian (rectangular) coordinate system. For a line
element, one has

where x0 is the time coordinate ct. If ds2 is positive, then P ′ is reached from P by
a movement with a velocity smaller than the velocity of light. Equation (2.2) can be

This is used in (2.3), yielding
ds2 = d⃗x′⊺J ⊺MJ d⃗x′ = d⃗x′⊺Gd⃗x′.
(2.6)
So the metric matrix G is deﬁned as
G def
= J ⊺MJ ∈R4×4.
(2.7)
The matrix elements gik are functions of the parameters x′
i. They may change their
values from point to point. In Special Relativity, G = M in any ﬁnite region. An
unforced particle moves in such a region straightforwardly and uniformly.
But if the particle is in a gravitational ﬁeld, the motion is curvilinear and nonuni-
form. Depending on the nature of the gravitational ﬁeld, the gik are functions of
other parameters. At most ten different elements gik of the symmetric 4 × 4-matrix
G describe the ﬁeld of gravitation at every point in the coordinate system. In every
local coordinate system the gik are constant and can be transformed by a similar-
ity transformation into the form M. Because if G = J ⊺MJ , then one immediately
obtains with the transformation d⃗x′ = J −1 d⃗ξ
d⃗x′⊺Gd⃗x′ = d⃗ξ
⊺J −1⊺J ⊺MJJ −1 d⃗ξ = d⃗ξ
⊺M d⃗ξ.

2.2
Motion in a Gravitational Field
53
But this is true only for a point because the matrices J are different from point to
point. There is no transformation matrix J which is valid globally.
2.2 Motion in a Gravitational Field
What inﬂuence does a gravitational ﬁeld have on a mass particle? Following the
relativity principle, in the local inertial system, which means in a coordinate system
moving with the particle, the laws of special relativity are valid. For the movement
of a particle with no external forces acting on it,
d2⃗ξ
dτ 2 = 0.
(2.8)
The proper time τ follows from
ds2 = c2 dτ 2 = d⃗ξ
⊺M d⃗ξ.
(2.9)
By integrating (2.8), one gets with the initial position ⃗ξ(0) and the initial velocity
˙⃗ξ(0)
⃗ξ(τ) = ⃗ξ(0) + ˙⃗ξ(0)τ.
A photon also moves in a straight line in the local inertial system. But τ is then
not the proper time of the photon. A photon has no proper time because for light
ds = 0 = c dτ. Therefore, we introduce the parameter λ such that
d2⃗ξ
dλ2 = 0
is the equation of motion of the photon in the local inertial system. Now we move
from the local inertial system with the spacetime vector ⃗ξ to the global inertial
system with the spacetime vector ⃗x. With
J def
= ∂⃗ξ
∂⃗x⊺
one gets for (2.9)
ds2 = c2 dτ 2 = d⃗x⊺J ⊺MJ d⃗x = d⃗x⊺Gd⃗x.
(2.10)
For light this becomes
d⃗x⊺Gd⃗x = 0.

2.3 Geodesic Lines and Equations of Motion
The motion of photons and particles in a gravitational ﬁeld will again be considered,
but now using the calculus of variations. The same results as in (2.16) are expected.
This is to be seen by using the same Christoffel matrix Γ in the results. In special
relativity, the motion of a photon is given by c2t2 = x⊺x, that means s2 = c2t2 −
x⊺x = 0, or ds2 = dx2
0 −dx⊺dx = d⃗x⊺M d⃗x = 0 for any small distance dx. If
paths were straight lines, that would mean the shortest possible connection between
the points P1 and P2. Also the theory of general relativity demands that light and
particles move on straightest possible paths. These paths are the so-called geodesic
curves for which the length has an extreme value:
δ
 P2

ds = 0.
(2.34)
This produces a system of four differential equations. For the variation of ds2 we
obtain

δ d⃗x⊺

but since G is symmetric, G = G⊺, we get
2(δ ds)ds = 2d⃗x⊺G(δ d⃗x) + d⃗x⊺(δG)d⃗x.
(2.36)
Equation (2.36) divided by 2ds results, with d(δ⃗x) = δ d⃗x and d⃗x

Just a word regarding the derivatives with respect to s. If s2 and ds2 are positive,
then it is a so-called time-like event. Then
(ds)2 = c2 dt2 −dx⊺dx = c2 dt2 −˙x⊺˙x dt2,
ds =

c2 −v2 dt,
so
γ ds = c dt.
Substituting ds = c dτ, one obtains
γ dτ = dt.
A comparison with the results of special relativity theory provides dτ = dt′, i.e. the
time that elapses in the moving coordinate system X ′. One calls in this context τ as
proper time.
2.4 Example: Uniformly Rotating Systems
We will consider a ﬁxed inertial frame X with the coordinates t,x,y and z and
a uniformly around the z-axis rotating coordinate system K with the coordinates
τ,r,ϕ and z. Then the transformation equations are

If a clock is in the rotating system at the position (r,θ,z) and one considers two
temporally directly adjacent events with dr = dϕ = dz = 0, then one obtains for the
proper time ds in this case the relationship (with v = rω)
ds = dτ

1 −r2ω2/c2 = dτ

1 −v2/c2 = dτ/γ.
This is the relationship known from the theory of special relativity! For the calcula-
tion of the acceleration, the derivatives of the metric matrix are needed. In this case,

(2.90)
Equation (2.88) multiplied by the mass m represents the centrifugal force, and
(2.90) multiplied by the mass m is the so-called Coriolis force! The accelerations
occurring in this rotating system are determined by the elements gij = gij(⃗x) of
the coordinate-dependent metric matrix G(⃗x). For a local reference system, one
can always specify a coordinate transformation (with J −1(⃗x)), so that the trans-
formed system is obviously an inertial frame. In general, for an accelerated or non-
uniformly moving (e.g. rotating) system no globally valid transformation matrix J
can be speciﬁed. The given space is curved!

system by applying the formula (2.18). According to (2.84),

2.5 General Coordinate Transformations
In the theory of general relativity, the invariance of the mathematical descriptions
is demanded for the general laws of nature with respect to each other arbitrarily
moving coordinate systems. Even more generally:
The invariance of the mathematical descriptions with respect to arbitrary coordi-
nate transformations is required.
2.5.1 Absolute Derivatives
First, we must clarify how the derivatives eventually have to be modiﬁed so that the
derived expressions are invariant under coordinate transformations.
Suppose a vector ﬁeld a(λ) is deﬁned along a curve whose parametric represen-
tation is given by ⃗x(λ). Going on to another coordinate system K′ with a′, for the
mathematical description of dynamic processes one is especially interested in how
the derivative da/dλ is transformed into da′/dλ. Because T = T (⃗x(λ)), it follows
that
da′
dλ = d(T a)
dλ
= T da
dλ +
d⃗x⊺
dλ ⊗I 4

∂T
∂⃗x a,
(2.93)
i.e. da/dλ is not transformed into da′/dλ as was a by a simple multiplication with
the transformation matrix T . For this the reason, the deﬁnition of the derivative is
da
dλ = lim
δλ→0
a(λ + δλ) −a(λ)
δλ
,
where the difference of the vectors is formed at different places on the curve γ , to
which transformation matrices T (λ) ̸= T (λ + δλ) generally belong.
Thus in order to be always able to take the same transformation matrix, the dif-
ference of two vectors must be taken at the same place of the curve. It is true that
δa ≈da
dλδλ
(2.94)

68

Theory of General Relativity
and, if the shift of a is taken along a geodesic line,
da
dλ +

I 4 ⊗a⊺
Γ d⃗x
dλ = 0,
so
da
dλ = −

I 4 ⊗a⊺
Γ d⃗x
dλ.
(2.95)
Here d⃗x
dλ is the tangent vector to the geodesic curve γ , and ⃗x(λ) is the parametric
representation of γ . Multiplying (2.95) with δλ, we obtain
δa = −

I 4 ⊗a⊺
Γ δ⃗x.
(2.96)
Moving the vector a(λ) from the position ⃗x(λ) parallel to the position ⃗x(λ+δλ),
the vector
a def
= a(λ) + δa
is obtained, or by (2.96),
a ≈a(λ) −

I 4 ⊗a⊺
Γ δ⃗x.
(2.97)
On the other hand, a(λ + δλ) −a is a vector at the position γ (λ + δλ), as is
(a(λ + δλ) −a)/δλ. As δλ →0 the quotient is always a vector at the same location
that varies, however.
The limit of this ratio is called absolute derivative Da
dλ of a(λ) along the curve γ :
lim
δλ→0
a(λ + δλ) −a
δλ
≈da
dλ + lim
δλ→0

which is obtained with (2.97), and therefore one deﬁnes the absolute derivative as

I 4 ⊗a⊺
Γ d⃗x



(2.98)
The differentiated vector can be decomposed into
˙a = ∂a
∂⃗x⊺˙⃗x,
(2.99)
so that in (2.98) one can extract ˙⃗x to the right:
Da

written a||⃗x⊺(∈R4×4):

(2.101)
This covariant derivative a∥⃗x⊺becomes the normal partial derivative
a

that means, there is no gravitational ﬁeld.
2.5.2 Transformation of the Christoffel Matrix ˜Γ
In (2.22), the Christoffel matrix is deﬁned:

with ⃗x′, one obtains with the transformation matrices

∂⃗x′⊺

∂⃗x⊺( ¯T ⊗¯T ) + J ∂¯T
∂⃗x⊺( ¯T ⊗I 4).
(2.106)

Inserting (2.106) in (2.105) reveals
˜Γ
′ = T ˜Γ ( ¯T ⊗¯T ) + T ∂¯T
∂⃗x⊺( ¯T ⊗I 4).
(2.107)
The second term on the right-hand side shows the coordinate dependence of the
transformation matrix T .
Another important characteristic is obtained as follows. Differentiating I 4 = T ¯T
with respect to ⃗x⊺yields
O = ∂T
∂⃗x⊺(I 4 ⊗¯T ) + T ∂¯T
∂⃗x⊺,
i.e.
T ∂¯T
∂x⊺= −∂T
∂⃗x⊺(I 4 ⊗¯T ).
(2.108)
Putting this in (2.107), one gets another form of the transformed Christoffel matrix,
namely
˜Γ
′ = T ˜Γ ( ¯T ⊗¯T ) −∂T
∂⃗x⊺( ¯T ⊗¯T ).

2.6 Incidental Remark
If one starts with an equation which is valid in the presence of gravity in general
relativity, then this equation must for v2 ≪c2 pass over to Newton’s equation. The
force of interaction of two discrete masses m and m1 is proportional to the product
of the two known masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance of
the two centres of gravity:
f = G
mm1
|x −x1|2
x −x1
|x −x1|,
or
f = m · G
m1
|x −x1|3 (x −x1).
For several discrete masses mi, this attraction is obtained as
f = m · G

i
mi
|x −xi|3 (x −xi),
and for a distributed mass with the mass density ρ
f = m · G

V
ρ(xi) x −xi
|x −xi|3 dV.

2.6
Incidental Remark
77
In an electric ﬁeld of strength e, which together with a charge q produces the force
f = qe, we deﬁne the gravitational ﬁeld strength eG, producing the force f = meG
acting on the mass m. For several discrete masses, the gravitational ﬁeld strength is
eG = G

i
mi
|x −xi|3 (x −xi).
So we can divide the analysis of the problem into two steps. In the ﬁrst step, the
gravitational ﬁeld generated by several masses mi at the point x is determined, and
in the second step, the force acting on the mass m at the point x is determined.
The potential energy is the integral of force times distance, so
U = −

f ⊺ds = −m

e⊺
G ds def
= mφ.
If a mass m is displaced by a small distance x, the work done is equal to the
change in potential energy
W = −U = fxx.
Dividing this equation by x, this force in the x-direction is given as
fx = −U
x .
Dividing by the mass m, one gets the x-component of the strength of the gravita-
tional ﬁeld
ex = −φ
x .
Whence it follows generally with x →0, that
e = −∇φ,
so
f = −m∇φ,
or
d2x
dt2 = −∇φ(x),

where the gravitational potential φ, which is a scalar function of the position x,
is obtained from the second-order linear partial differential equation, the Poisson
equation
φ(x) = 4πGρ(x),
(2.147)
with the gravitational constant G and the mass density ρ(x). This equation
shows the relationship between gravitational potential and matter in the Newtonian
Physics. The above two steps are thus:

78

Theory of General Relativity
Step 1. Find the solution φ(x) of the Poisson equation (2.147).
Step 2. Use the solution of (2.147) to ﬁnd x(t).
This is the approach in the classical Newtonian Physics. How must we do or
modify the two steps in the theory of general relativity, i.e. how does one generally
get the gik’s and how does one establish the dynamic equations? In the case when
only the element g00 depends on x, i.e. only the 00-element of the sub-matrix Γ i is
different from zero, then
Γ i =

According to (2.146), the acceleration is proportional to the partial derivative of the
gravitational potential φ with respect to the coordinates xi. Looking at the equation
¨⃗x = −

I 4 ⊗˙⃗x⊺
Γ ˙⃗x,
(2.148)
on the left-hand side of the equation one has acceleration and on the right-hand side
there is the matrix Γ comprising partial derivatives of the gij’s with respect to the
coordinates xℓ. The gij’s apparently play in General Relativity the same role as the
gravitational potential φ does in classical Physics. There the gravitational potential
φ was determined by the Poisson equation whose form is, for the most part, given
by the Laplace operator :
φ = ∂2φ
∂x2
1
+ ∂2φ
∂x2
2
+ ∂2φ
∂x2

= 4πGρ(x).
So one is now looking for a mathematical expression involving the second deriva-
tives of the gij’s with respect to the four spacetime coordinates xi. Such a term
appears, in fact, in the differential geometry of Gauss and Riemann, to be precise,
in the investigation of the curvature of surfaces or hyper-surfaces in three- or n-
dimensional spaces, where the surfaces are described by quadratic forms with the
gij’s as the corresponding matrix elements. Therefore, the appendix “Some Dif-
ferential Geometry” deals with the theory of curvature of surfaces in three- and
n-dimensional spaces.
2.7 Parallel Transport
For further considerations, we need the deﬁnition of parallel transport:
1. The parallel displacement of a vector a, which is tangential to the curved surface
and runs along a geodesic of this surface, is deﬁned as follows: The origin point
of the vector moves along the geodesic and the vector itself moves continuously
so that its angle with the geodesic and its length remains constant. It then changes
by a parallel transport along δx according to (2.96) with δa = −(I 4 ⊗a⊺)Γ δx.

2.7
Parallel Transport
79
Fig. 2.1 Parallel transport
2. The parallel displacement of a vector on a surface along a broken line, consisting
of some geodesic pieces, is done so that from the ﬁrst corner to the second corner
the vector is moved along the ﬁrst geodesic arc, then along the second arc, etc.
3. Finally, the parallel translation of a vector along a smooth curve is described by
the limiting process, in which the curve is approximated by broken lines consist-
ing of geodesic pieces.
If a vector a in a ﬂat space, where Γ = 0, moves in parallel along a closed loop, it
comes back to the starting point with the same length and direction. But if a modiﬁed
vector comes back, so it must be true that Γ ̸= 0—there exists curvature.
Example If you move a vector a on a sphere (Fig. 2.1), beginning at the equator at
a point A, along a meridian to the north pole N, then along another meridian back to
the equator at a point B, and ﬁnally back along the equator to the starting point A,
then the incoming vector a′ has a direction other than the initial vector a. Calling
the difference between the starting and end vector
a def
= a′ −a,
the question is: What happens to a when the circulated area is smaller and smaller?
Of course, a approaches the zero vector, but not the ratio a/(circulated area).
We now replace the spherical triangle of the example by a differentially small
square and consider not the difference vector a of a complete circulation. Instead,
the initial vector a is moved the half way around the square in one direction. Then
the same vector a is shifted half way in the other direction. At the meeting point
the difference a arises. This difference vector is deduced and considered more
precisely in the following section.

Riemannian Coordinate System
For the study of the properties of the Rieman-
nian curvature matrix, it is advantageous to ﬁrst perform a coordinate transforma-
tion, so that in the new coordinate system, the Christoffel matrices have the property
Γ = 0. Such a coordinate transformation is in the case of a curved spacetime, where
G depends on ⃗x, only locally possible, but then for each ⃗x! By the inverse trans-
formation of the obtained statements, they are again globally valid. So, we look for
a local coordinate transformation such that in the new coordinate system Γ = 0 is
valid. For geodesic lines the following applies to the four coordinates:
d2xk
ds2 +
d⃗x
ds

⊺
Γ k
d⃗x
ds = 0.
(2.176)
The xk’s belong to an arbitrary coordinate system in which the geodesic is described
by xk = xk(s) and s is the arc length along the curve. At a ﬁxed point P with the
coordinate ⃗x(0), any coordinate can be developed in a power series:
xk = x(0)

(2.177)
where ζk is the kth component of the tangent vector

P
to the geodesic at the point P. Then, however, according to (2.176),
d2xk
ds2 = −ζ ⊺(Γ k)Pζ.
(2.178)
Plugging this into (2.177), considering a small neighbourhood of P, a small xk −
x(0)
k , and neglecting powers higher than two gives
xk = x(0)
k
+ ζks −1
2ζ ⊺(Γ k)Pζs2.
(2.179)
Now, calling ζs = ⃗x′, the following is obtained from (2.179):
xk = x(0)
k
+ x′

2 ⃗x′⊺(Γ k)P ⃗x′.

What is the corresponding metric matrix G′ in

(2.182)
But since in the new coordinate system the geodesics are straight lines of the form
⃗x′ = ζs, in (2.182) the expression (I 4 ⊗ζ ⊺)Γ ′(ζs)ζ must be equal to the zero
vector. Since ζ are arbitrary vectors, the following must be valid for s = 0:
Γ ′(0) = 0.
(2.183)
Implications for the Riemannian Curvature Matrix
If at a point P for a special
coordinate system one has Γ P = 0, then naturally any ˇΓ γ

2.10 The Ricci Matrix and Its Properties
The reason for considering the Riemannian curvature theory is to ﬁnd with its help
a way to determine the components of the Christoffel matrix Γ , which are needed

to calculate the solution of the equations

Γ ˙⃗x,
describing the dynamic behaviour of particles in a gravitational ﬁeld. But the Rie-
mannian curvature matrix has, being a 16×16-matrix, 256 components, so, it would
provide 256 equations in extreme cases. Considering, however, that there are 4 rows
and 4 columns of R with all zeros, only 12 · 12 = 144 equations remain—still too
many. The number of equations can be reduced signiﬁcantly, however, by reduc-
ing, using clever addition of matrix elements, the number of components of the
newly formed matrix. Setting up in this way a symmetric 4 × 4-matrix, we would
get exactly 10 independent equations for the determination of the 10 independent
components of G. Such a matrix is called the Ricci matrix, which can be obtained
in two ways. One way is through the sum of sub-matrices on the diagonal of R; it is
described in the Appendix. The second way is as follows:
The Ricci matrix RRic consists of the traces of sub-matrices Rγ δ of R
RRic,γ δ
def


Rγ δ
=

ν=0
Rγ δ

(2.200)
Accordingly, the components of the new matrix ˇRRic are deﬁned as
ˇRRic,γ δ
def
=
3

ν=0
ˇRγ δ
νν .
(2.201)
From (2.194) one may read immediately that the Ricci matrix ˇRRic is symmetric
because ˇRγ δ
νν = ˇRδγ
νν .
Moreover, because of (2.162),
R =

G−1 ⊗I 4

(2.202)
so
Rγ δ =

2.10.1 Symmetry of the Ricci Matrix RRic
Even if the Riemannian matrix R itself is not symmetric, the derived Ricci matrix
RRic is nevertheless symmetric; and that will be shown below. The symmetry will
follow from the component equations (2.209) of the Ricci matrix. One sees imme-
diately that the second and fourth summand are symmetric in γ and δ. Looking at
(3
ν=0
∂
∂xδ Γ ν
γ ν, it is not directly seen that this term is symmetric in γ and δ. This
can be seen using the Laplace expansion theorem for determinants.1 Developing the
determinant of G along the νth row, one gets
g def
= det(G) = gν1Aν1 + ··· + gνδAνδ + ··· + gνnAνn,
1The sum of the products of all elements of a row (or column) with its adjuncts is equal to the
determinant’s value: detA = (n
j=1(−1)i+j · aij · detAij (development along the ith row)

2.10
The Ricci Matrix and Its Properties
91
where Aνδ is the element in the νth row and δth column of the adjoint of G. If g[−1]
δν
is the (δν)-element of the inverse matrix G−1, then g[−1]
δν
= 1
g Aνδ, so Aνδ = gg[−1]
δν
.
Thus we obtain
∂g
∂gνδ
= Aνδ = gg[−1]
δν
,
or
δg = gg[−1]
δν
δgνδ,
and
∂g

,
i.e.
1
g
∂g
∂xγ
= g[−1]
δν
∂gνδ
∂xγ
.
(2.211)
Due to (2.62), on the other hand, one has

γ ν =

g[−1]

i.e. the last two summands cancel out, and the following remains:

ν=0
Γ ν
γ ν =
3

ν=0
3

δ=0
g[−1]

Then it follows by (2.211) that

.
(2.212)
From this form the symmetry in γ and δ can immediately be observed.
Now remains to show that the third term
3

ν=0
3

μ=0
Γ ν

in (2.209) is symmetric. But this can spotted from the following equalities:

νγ =

ν,μ=0
Γ ν

Combining everything together demonstrates that the Ricci matrix RRic is, in fact,
symmetric!

∂
∂xβ
ˇRγ κ
αδ + ∂

(2.213)
For the third term we can, with respect to (2.172), also write
−∂
∂xδ
ˇRγ κ
αβ .
Substituting now α = β and summing over α, we obtain

ˇRRic,γ κ = 0.
(2.214)
In the second term, one can, based on (2.171), replace ˇRγ κ
αδ by −ˇRακ
γ δ . If we set
γ = δ and sum over γ , we obtain from (2.214) with the “curvature scalar” ˇR def

∂

ˇR −2

α=0
∂
∂xα
ˇRRic,ακ = 0.
(2.216)
We would get the same result, when this equation was assumed:

ˇRαβ
γ δ −2 ∂
∂xβ
ˇRακ
γ δ = 0.
(2.217)

Indeed, setting δ = γ and summing over γ , we receive ﬁrst:
∂
∂xκ
ˇRRic,αβ −2 ∂
∂xβ
ˇRRic,ακ = 0.
Substituting now α = β and summing over α, we receive again (2.216).
A different result is obtained when starting at ﬁrst from (2.217) (with ν instead
of α), multiplying this equation by g[−1]
αν ,
∂
∂xκ
g[−1]
αν
ˇRνβ

then setting γ = δ, summing over γ and ν, and using (2.214):

If we now set α = β and sum over α, we ﬁnally obtain the important relationship

RRic,ακ = 0.

According to Newton, for the acceleration the following is valid:

(2.222)
where φ(x) is the gravitational potential and x ∈R3. One can also write
d2x
dt2 + ∇φ(x) = 0.
(2.223)
The Newtonian universal time is a parameter which has two degrees of freedom,
namely the time origin t0 and a, the unit of time, both can be chosen arbitrarily:
t = t0 + aτ. Thus we obtain

The 4 × 4-sub-matrices on the main diagonal of the curvature matrix R contain
exactly the components of the left-hand side of the Poisson equation. This subse-

(2.229)
so that ﬁnally the Poisson equation can also be succinctly written as
−R = 4πGρ.
(2.230)
The relationship in Newtonian mechanics between the gravitational potential φ and
matter is the Poisson equation
φ = 4πGρ,
where ρ is the mass density and G the Newtonian Gravitational Constant. In the
theory of General Relativity, it is now required to set up general invariant equations
of gravitation between the gik’s and matter. It is useful to characterise the matter by
the energy–momentum matrix T = T total.
For the rotating system in Sect. 2.5, we had ¨r = r(ω+ ˙ϕ)2 so that there the poten-
tial was φ = −ω2r2
2
and g00 = 1 −r2ω2
c2
= 1 + 2φ
c2 . On the other hand, in Newtonian
non-relativistic limit v2
c2 ⩽1, we obtained for the energy–momentum matrix (see
Sect. 1.9.2) T00 = c2ρ0 and for the remaining Tij ≈0.
With φ = c2
2 (g00 −1) we obtain φ = c2
2 g00. So one can write for the above
Poisson equation
g00 = 8πG
c4 T00.
(2.231)
2.11.3 The Einstein’s Equation with G
If one assumes that in the general case, i.e. in the presence of gravitational ﬁelds on
the right-hand side of (2.231), the symmetric energy–momentum matrix is T , a ma-
trix containing the second partial derivatives of the elements of the metric matrix G

98
2
Theory of General Relativity
must appear on the left-hand side of the equation. If therefore the Einstein’s matrix
G is taken, one obtains the Einstein’s Field Equation
G = −8πG
c4 T .
(2.232)
Because the matrix T ∈R4×4 is symmetric, also the Einstein’s matrix
G = RRic −1
2RI 4
(2.233)
must be symmetric. This is indeed the case because both the Ricci matrix RRic and
the diagonal matrix RI 4 are symmetric. RRic is extracted, according to (2.200),
from the Riemannian curvature matrix
R =
 ∂Γ
∂x⊺+ (Γ ⊗I 4)(I 4 ⊗Γ )

(U4×4 −I 16).
(2.234)
Final Form of the Einstein’s Equation
The energy–momentum matrix T on the
right-hand side of the Einstein’s ﬁeld equation (2.232) has the property that T ⃗∇= 0,
if one considers a closed system, i.e. if there are no external forces acting. The same
must apply on the left: G ⃗∇= 0. But that is, due to (2.221), true for the symmetric
matrix G!
Overall, the ﬁnal Einstein’s Field Equation is ﬁxed as an axiom as
G = RRic −R
2 I 4 = −8πG
c4 T .
(2.235)
This is a matrix differential equation for determining the metric matrix G. This is
no longer an “action-at-a-distance-equation” as Newton’s, but describes the relation-
ships at a spacetime point ⃗x! RRic depends linearly on the second order derivatives
of gik, and depends nonlinearly on the gik directly. So the Einstein’s equation is a
coupled system of second-order nonlinear partial differential equations for the de-
termination of the components gik of the metric matrix G as a function of the given
distribution of matter, i.e. the matrix T , the source of the gravitational ﬁeld.
By taking the trace, from (2.235) it follows that
R −R
2 · 4 = −8πG
c4 T,
so
R = 8πG
c4 T,
(2.236)
where
T def
= trace(T ).

2.12
Summary
99
Substituting (2.236) into (2.235), one obtains the following form of the Einstein’s
Field Equation:
RRic = 8πG
c4
T
2 I 4 −T

.
(2.237)
By the way, the constant factor 8πG

(2.238)
2.12 Summary
2.12.1 Covariance Principle
Einstein postulated the Equivalence Principle:
Gravitational forces are equivalent to inertial forces.
Gravitational ﬁelds can be eliminated by transitioning to an accelerated coordinate
system. In this new local inertial frame, the laws of the theory of special relativity
are valid.
Directly from the equivalence principle follows the Covariance Principle:
The equations of physics must be invariant under
general coordinate transformations.
In particular, this means that even in a local inertial frame the equations must be
valid, so the transition from a metric matrix G to a Minkowski matrix M results in
the laws of special relativity.
The connection is G = J ⊺MJ and M = J −1⊺GJ −1, i.e. using the special trans-
formation matrix T (⃗x) = J −1(⃗x) leads for a particular event ⃗x to a local inertial
frame in which the laws of special relativity apply. Conversely, one passes from
the special local inertial frame with the event ⃗ξ to the same event in the general
coordinate system ⃗x by the transformation ⃗x = J −1⃗ξ.
The physical equations in the theory of general relativity must be formulated so
that they are invariant (covariant) with respect to general coordinate transformations.
Above we derived: The formulas in the theory of general relativity are invariant
under coordinate transformations if one replaces in the formulas of special relativity
the ordinary derivatives
∂a
∂x⊺by the covariant derivatives a∥x⊺. Then we’re done!
The law applies generally.

Herein the ordinary differential d˙⃗ξ must be replaced by the covariant differential

(2.242)
Through the Christoffel matrix Γ , the effect of the gravitational ﬁeld is expressed.
If no gravitational ﬁeld is present, then Γ = 0 and (2.239) is again obtained. A com-
parison of (2.242) with the equation of a geodesic shows that a material particle
moves on a geodesic, so to speak, “on the shortest path in curved space”.
If, in addition to gravitational forces, other forces appear, e.g. exerted by electric
ﬁelds, then for an inertial frame one has the equation
md˙⃗ξ
dτ = ⃗f .
(2.243)
This equation multiplied from the left with J −1 and again used with the covariant

2.12.2 Einstein’s Field Equation and Momentum
The Einstein’s ﬁeld equation expresses that each form of matter and energy is a
source of the gravitational ﬁeld. The gravitational ﬁeld is described by the metric
matrix G, the components of which must be determined by using Einstein’s Field
Equation
RRic −R
2 I 4 = −8πG
c4 T .
(2.246)
So one basically has to perform the same procedure as in Newton’s dynamics:
1. Solve the Poisson equation φ(x) = 4πGρ(x), to determine the potential func-
tion φ.
2. Establish the solution of the equation d2x
dt2 = −∇φ(x).
In the theory of general relativity, we now arrive at the following procedure:
1. Solve Einstein’s Field Equation (2.246) RRic −R
2 I 4 = −8πG
c4 T , to determine
the metric matrix G.
2. Establish the solution of (2.245)
md⃗u
dτ = ⃗f x −m

I 4 ⊗⃗u⊺
Γ ⃗u.
2.13 Hilbert’s Action Functional
Above, the Einstein’s equation was postulated as an axiom. Einstein has found this
equation through years of hard work. As a supplement, we will now shown that
one can obtain the Einstein’s equation with the help of the calculus of variations.
Following Hilbert, this is derived from a variational principle, but initially only for
the free gravitational ﬁeld, i.e. when T = 0.
The gravitational ﬁeld is determined primarily by the metric matrix G, i.e. the
curvature of space caused by this ﬁeld. All curvature parameters are concentrated in
the curvature scalar R which is formed through the trace of the Ricci matrix RRic.
Now a variational functional, the Hilbert’s action functional, is formed so that the
space curvature is minimal:
WGrav =

R dV.
(2.247)

Theory of General Relativity
However, this integral is not invariant under coordinate transformations Θ. There-
fore, we need the following considerations: Let
Θ⊺(⃗x)G(⃗x)Θ(⃗x) = M,
(2.248)
i.e. Θ(⃗x) is the matrix which at the point ⃗x transforms the metric matrix G into
the Minkowski matrix M. Computing the determinants on both sides of (2.248), we
obtain
det(G)
  
g
det(Θ)2
  
Θ2
= det(M) = −1,
(2.249)
i.e.
√−g = 1
Θ .
In a Cartesian coordinate system, the integral of a scalar with respect to the scalar
dV = dx0 · dx1 · dx2 · dx3 is also a scalar. When passing to curvilinear coordinates
⃗x′, the integration element dV is
1
Θ dV ′ =

−g′ dV ′.
In curvilinear coordinates, √−g dV behaves as an invariant when integrated over
any area of the four-dimensional space. If f is a scalar, then f √−g, which is in-
variant when integrated over dV , is named the scalar density. This quantity provides
a scalar for its multiplication with the four-dimensional volume element dV .
For this reason, we now consider only the effect
WGrav =

R

Γ (x), ∂Γ
∂x⊺

√−g d4⃗x.
(2.250)
Under d4⃗x the four-dimensional volume element dx0 · dx1 · dx2 · dx3 is understood.
The Einstein’s equation will follow from (2.250) and the condition δWGrav = 0 for
any variation δgik. R√−g is a Lagrange density which is integrated over the vol-
ume. The elements of Γ k

∂G−1 R + √−g ∂R
∂G−1 = 0.

According to the Laplace expansion theorem for determinants (“The sum of the

(2.262)
where A[−1]
γβ
is the element in the γ th row and βth column of the adjoint of G−1;
g[−1]
γβ
is the (γβ)-element of G−1. It is, of course, true that
G = adj(G−1)
det(G−1)
so element-wise gβγ = g · A[−1]
γβ , or A[−1]
γβ
= 1
g gβγ . Thus, we obtain by partial dif-

so

Chapter 3
Gravitation of a Spherical Mass
The chapter begins with the ﬁrst solution of Einstein’s equations obtained in 1916
by Schwarzschild for a spherical mass. From these results, the inﬂuence of a mass
in time and space and the redshift of the spectral lines are given. This gives also a
ﬁrst indication of the existence of “black holes”. Finally, a brief look at the effect of
rotating masses and on the Lense–Thirring effect is taken.
3.1 Schwarzschild’s Solution
Because of its simplicity, the solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equation will now be de-
termined for the outside of a spherically symmetric, uniform, time-invariant mass
distribution. This ﬁrst exact solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equation was given in 1916
by Schwarzschild.
As r →∞, the desired metric should be the Minkowski metric, i.e.
ds2 = c2 dt2 −dr2 −r2
dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2
.
(3.1)
where r,θ and ϕ are the spherical coordinates. For a gravitational ﬁeld, we now start
with
ds2 = A(r)dt2 −B(r)dr2 −r2
dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2
.
(3.2)
Since the ﬁeld must be spherically symmetric, the factors A and B may depend only
on r and not on θ or ϕ. Due to (3.1), the factor A(r) must tend to c2 as r →∞, and
the factor B(r) →1. The metric matrix thus has the form
G =

3.1.3 The Factors A(r) and B(r)
To ﬁnally write down the metric matrix G, the two factors A(r) and B(r) are re-
quired. Since we search for the solution of Einstein’s ﬁeld equation outside the
sphere containing the mass and having the energy–momentum matrix T equal to
the zero matrix, the Ansatz RRic = 0 thus yields

(3.13)
Adding to (3.11) divided by A (3.12) divided by B, we obtain the condition
A′B + AB′ = 0,
(3.14)
which means nothing else than that
AB = constant.
(3.15)

3.1
Schwarzschild’s Solution
115
However, since A(∞) = c2 and B(∞) = 1 as r →∞, the constant must be equal
to c2, so
A(r)B(r) = c2
and
B(r) =
c2
A(r).
Substituting this into (3.13), we obtain A + rA′ = c2, which we also can write
d(rA)
dr
= c2.
(3.16)
Integrating this equation yields
rA = c2(r + K),
(3.17)
so
A(r) = c2

1 + K
r

and
B(r) =

1 + K
r

−1
.
(3.18)
K still remains to be determined. In Sect. 2.8, a uniform rotating system was treated.
In (2.85), we obtained the element g00 of the metric matrix G as
g00 = 1 −r2ω2
c2
(3.19)
and in (2.88) the centrifugal force mrω2. According to Sect. 2.8, the centrifugal
force f depends, on the other hand, on the centrifugal potential ϕ, so together
f = −m∇ϕ.
(3.20)
Taking
ϕ = −r2ω2
2
(3.21)
(3.20) provides just the above centrifugal force. Equation (3.21) inserted into (3.19)
provides the general connection
g00 = 1 + 2ϕ
c2 .
(3.22)
Outside of our spherical mass M, as Newton’s approximation the gravitational po-
tential
ϕ = −GM
r
(3.23)
is obtained. This used in (3.22) and compared with (3.18) yields
K = −2GM

(3.26)
For the so-called Schwarzschild’s radius
rS
def
= 2GM
c2
,
(3.27)
the Schwarzschild’s metric shows a singularity as for r = 0. Of these, however,
only the singularity at r = 0 is a real singularity. This is suggested even by the fact
that, when r = rS, the determinant of G, namely g = −r4 sin2 θ, has no singularity.
The singularity at r = rS is not a physical singularity but a coordinate singularity,
which depends entirely on the choice of the coordinate system, i.e. there would exist
no singularity at this place if a different coordinate system were chosen! More about
this in the next section on black holes.
3.2 Inﬂuence of a Massive Body on the Environment
3.2.1 Introduction
The Schwarzschild’s solution (3.26) is valid only outside the solid sphere of
radius rM generating the gravity, so only for rM < r < ∞. Because for the
Schwarzschild’s radius rS the element g11 = (1 −rS
r )−1 goes to inﬁnity, rS is also a
limit. In general, rS ≪rM, but for the so-called Black Holes one has rM < rS, and
in this case the solution is limited to rS < r < ∞.

3.2
Inﬂuence of a Massive Body on the Environment
117
3.2.2 Changes to Length and Time
How does a length change in the environment of a massive body? For a constant
time, i.e. for dt = 0 one receives, due to (3.26),
dℓ2 =

1 −2GM
c2r

−1
dr2 + r2
dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2
.
(3.28)
On the surface of a sphere of radius r > rM with the centre being the centre of mass,
as also for dr = 0, the tangential inﬁnitely small distances are given by
dL = r

dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ21/2.
(3.29)
This is a result that is valid on every sphere, whether with or without gravity. But
what happens with a distance in the radial direction? In this case, dθ and dϕ are
equal to zero, thus for inﬁnitely small distances in the radial direction, according to
(3.28), one obtains
dR =

1 −2GM
c2r

−1/2
dr,
(3.30)
so dR > dr, and so the length is much longer, the larger the mass M and the smaller
the distance r from the mass! dr is through the mass ‘elongated’, caused by a cur-
vature of space.
Let us now turn to the time. For a clock at the point, where r,θ, and ϕ are con-
stant, we obtain from the Schwarzschild’s metric (3.26)
ds2 = c2 dτ 2 = c2

1 −2GM
c2r

dt2,
so
dτ =

1 −2GM
c2r

1/2
dt.
(3.31)
If dτ < dt, the closer one is located to the mass, the shorter are the time intervals, i.e.
the slower the time passes! For an observer the time goes slower the closer he is to
the mass. Particularly large is the time dilation near a Black Hole in which the mass
is so concentrated that the body radius is smaller than its own Schwarzschild’s ra-
dius. For a black hole with a mass of ten solar masses, the Schwarzschild’s radius is
rS = 30 km. At a distance of 1 cm from the so-called horizon, which is the spherical
shell around the centre of mass with radius rS, γ = (1−2GM
c2r )1/2 = 1.826·10−5, so
the time goes by about 55000 times slower than far away: after a year near the hori-
zon of the black hole, in a place far away, e.g. on the home planet of an astronaut,
55000 years would have gone by! All is summed up into a popular statement:

118
3
Gravitation of a Spherical Mass
If you climb a mountain, you are smaller and age faster!
The relations (3.30) and (3.31) are very similar to the relationships of space and
time contractions for the relatively to each other moving reference frames in special
relativity; see Chap. 1. There with
γ def
=

1 −v2
c2

−1/2
for the length contraction we had
dℓ= 1
γ dℓ0
and for the time dilation
dt = γ dτ.
If we introduce the pseudo-velocity
v2
G(r) def
= 2GM
r
then with
γG(r) def
=

1 −v2
G(r)
c2

−1/2
the above gravitational relationships can be written as follows:
dr =
1
γG(r) dR
and
dt = γG(r)dτ.
By the way, vG(r) is the escape velocity of a planet with the diameter 2r and
mass M.
3.2.3 Redshift of Spectral Lines
Suppose in the gravitational ﬁeld of a mass a light signal is sent from a transmitter
at a ﬁxed point xT = [rT ,θT ,ϕT ]⊺and it drifts along a geodesic line to a ﬁxed
receiver at the point xR = [rR,θR,ϕR]⊺. Let, furthermore, λ be any parameter along
the geodesic line, with λ = λT for the sent event and λ = λR for the received event.
Then for a photon, by (2.11), the following is valid:

dλ Gd⃗x
dλ = 0,

This time depends only on the path that the light takes between the spatially ﬁxed
transmitter and the spatially ﬁxed receiver. So for two consecutive transmitted sig-
nals 1 and 2 the duration is equal:
tE,1 −tS,1 = tE,2 −tS,2,
and also
tR
def
= tE,2 −tE,1 = tS,2 −tS,1
def
= tT ,
so the Schwarzschild’s time difference at the transmitter is equal to the Schwarzs-
child’s time difference at the receiver, though the clock of an observer at the trans-
mitter location would show the proper time difference to
τT =

tT
and accordingly at the receiving location the proper time difference would be
τR =

If the transmitter is a pulsating atom, emitting N pulses in the proper time interval

If the transmitter is closer to the mass compared to the receiver (rT < rR), then a
shift to the red in the “colour” of the signal takes place. Conversely, if the transmit-
ter is further away than the receiver, one gets a blueshift. For rS,rE ≫2GM one
obtains the approximation

This effect is indeed poorly measurable due to a variety of disturbances by the at-
mosphere. However, this redshift is measurable using the Mössbauer’s effect (see
the relevant Physics literature).

Let r0 be the smallest distance from the centre of mass, having a passing ﬂy-

coordinate system is still placed such that φ(r0) = 0. If gravity is not present, the

3.2

123
photon will continue to ﬂy straight and as r →∞we will have ϕ(∞) = π/2. It
comes from ϕ(−∞) = −π/2. Overall, therefore, the photon has covered an angle
of △ϕ = ϕ(∞) −ϕ(−∞) = π. Considering the gravity, the photon is “bent” to
the mass. It passes from (r0,ϕ(r0)) to ϕ(∞) = π/2 + α/2 as r →∞. For reasons
of symmetry, it is then ϕ(−∞) = π/2 −α/2 as r →−∞, so that the photon has
covered an overall angle of △ϕ = ϕ(∞) −ϕ(−∞) = π + α. This angle α is now
calculated for the solar mass M⊙= 1.9891 × 1033 g.
Since r0 should be the minimum distance, it is true that

in 1919 at a solar eclipse measured by Eddington.
3.3 Schwarzschild’s Inner Solution
For the determination of the metric inside a symmetric sphere, the right-hand side of
Einstein’s ﬁeld equation with the energy–momentum matrix is needed. The hydro-
mechanical energy–momentum matrix was deduced in Chap. 1 in (1.183) as
T mech =

ρ0 + p
c2

⃗u⃗u⊺−p M.
This was done in the Lorentz basis of an inertial frame. It can thus also be the local
inertial system of a general coordinate system. If for the relationship between the
local coordinates d⃗x and the global coordinates d⃗x′ the transformation equation is
d⃗x = J d⃗x′, then for the velocities one has ⃗u = J ⃗u′. If used above this yields
T mech =

ρ0 + p
c2

J ⃗u′⃗u′⊺J ⊺−p M.
(3.63)
Now multiplying this equation from the left with the matrix product J ⊺M and
from the right with the matrix product MJ, we ﬁnally obtain with MM = I and
J ⊺MJ = G
T mech,Riemann =

ϱ0 + p
c2

G⃗u′⃗u′⊺G −p G.
(3.64)

3.3

Now the metric matrix G appears globally.
The Einstein’s ﬁeld equation is used in the form (2.237)
RRic = 8π G
c4
T
2 I 4 −T

.
(3.65)
It is assumed that the masses inside the sphere do not move, the velocity components
are zero: u′
i = 0, for i = 1,2,3. Therefore, from the condition
c2 = ⃗u′⊺G⃗u′
there remains
c2 = g00u2
0.
If the metric matrix is chosen again as in (3.2), namely
ds2 = A(r)dt2 −B(r)dr2 −r2
dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2
,
(3.66)
then
u0 =

3.4 Black Holes
3.4.1 Astrophysics
The three most interesting celestial objects are white dwarfs, neutron stars and black
holes. Stars like the Sun are built up by compression of interstellar clouds, caused
by gravity. The contraction process comes to a standstill when the temperature in-
side becomes so great that nuclear fusion starts. By the nuclear fusion, hydrogen
is converted into helium. The further fate of a star depends on its initial mass: The
initial mass equal to

128
3
Gravitation of a Spherical Mass
• ≈0.05 solar mass ends up as a brown dwarf;
• ≈1 solar mass and of volume comparable to that of the Earth grows into a red
giant and ends after an explosion (supernova) as a white dwarf;
• ≈3 solar masses, with a corresponding radius of about 12 km, grows into a su-
pergiant and ends after explosion (supernova) as a neutron star;
• ≈30 solar masses grows into a supergiant and ends after explosion (supernova)
as a black hole.
A white dwarf is composed mostly of carbon and oxygen, produced by nuclear
fusion, that are left over when the nuclear solar fuel is consumed. A white dwarf
has a mass about that of our Sun and the diameter of the Earth, so a fairly compact
structure. However, a neutron star is much more compact, i.e. it has a factor of 109
higher density. It has roughly the mass of a white dwarf but a diameter of only
24 km! A black hole, on the other hand, has different masses, sizes, and densities,
as is further explained below.
The Schwarzschild’s solution (3.26)
ds2 =

c2 dt2 −

dθ2 + sin2 θ dϕ2
applies only outside the considered spherical mass. This formula gives the tiny
spacetime interval ds which mass elements cover, moving from an event A to a
closely adjacent event B. The Schwarzschild’s radius is therefore only interesting
for very large masses or masses with sufﬁcient density, where rS > R is the radius
of the spherical mass.
However, for the solar mass M⊙≈2 · 1030 kg the Schwarzschild’s radius is
rS⊙≈3 km,
i.e. it is much smaller than the solar radius r⊙≈7 · 105 km, so our solution is valid
only outside the mass of the Sun! For the Earth with a mass of M⊕≈6 · 1024 kg we
even obtain a Schwarzschild’s radius of
rS⊕≈9 mm!
It seems that the Schwarzschild’s radius only plays a role for highly concentrated
matter. But that is not the case. Indeed, consider just the radius of a spherical mass
R = rS, that is, R = 2GM
c2 . The so-called Schwarzschild’s density ρS would in this
case be

The required density decreases inversely proportionally with the square of the mass!
If one wants to do a black hole from Earth’s mass, i.e. shrink the Earth to a radius

of 9 mm, then the resulting body would have a density of 8.58 · 1022 kg/cm3. For
the Sun a density of approximately 8.6 · 1010 kg/cm3 would be necessary; that is,
86 million tons per cubic centimetre! So still the enormous density of the neutron
liquid1 is in a neutron star. In the centre of the Milky Way, there is a black hole with
a mass of 5.2 · 1036 kg, or 2.6 million solar masses, and in the centre of the Virgo
galaxy cluster, a black hole with the mass of 6 · 1039 kg (3 billion solar masses).
3.4.2 Further Details about “Black Holes”
A spherical mass of radius less than the Schwarzschild’s radius, R < rS, is called a
black hole. The name is explained as follows. The Schwarzschild’s solution (3.26)
for constant angles θ and ϕ, i.e. for dθ = dϕ = 0, with rS = 2GM
c2 , is

where the constant c0 depends on the start time t0 and on the starting location R0,

in the (ct −r)-half-plane, as shown in Fig. 3.1.
The light cones are to the right of the dividing line at r = rS upward open towards

particular, even photons on the minus-sign trajectories seemingly not exceed the

This velocity goes to zero as r goes to rS. For r < rS the light cone shows the future
in the direction r = 0. No particle or photon can escape from the ﬁeld r < rS! No
light can overstep the limit of rS; the “black hole” is, in fact, “black”! For a particle
at rS as is in Fig. 3.1, the time t decreases, so runs backwards! It is obvious that for
this region, the time t is not very suitable. On the other hand, it is a fallacy that the
boundary r = rS cannot be exceeded from the outside because the formulas report
only the behaviour which would be seen by an observer. An observer, ﬂying with
the particle, would normally exceed the limit r = rS because for him the speed in
the vicinity r = rS would not tend to zero, he would ﬂy continuously through this
sphere with ﬁnite speed. This can be shown as follows:
Due to Newton’s theory, we arrive at the following context. Integrating the equa-

(3.82)
The mass m0 would pass the Schwarzschild’s spherical shell for r = rS and accord-
ing to (3.82) with the speed of light c, which is not possible according to the special
theory of relativity! For r < rS the velocity would even be greater than light’s! The
velocity equations have to be modiﬁed. What happens then? If one passes through
the Schwarzschild’s spherical shell in the direction r →0, we will never be able to
learn from him what he experienced because neither he nor a signal from him to us
outside the Schwarzschild’s spherical shell will ever reach us. We only can analyse
theoretically what happens.

therefore, a ﬁnite time.
If a particle is located to the left of the parting line r = rS, then the particle
ﬂies left in the direction r →0. Photons, starting left of the parting line cannot also
exceed this border. Therefore, no light (photon) is coming outward from inside the
sphere of radius rS, a “black hole” is given there. Further, it is interesting that an
ensemble of boundary trajectories (each characterized with a minus sign) proceeds
in the negative direction of time, thus decreasing time. If one starts, for instance, at
the point (t0 = 0,r = r0 < rS) on a ‘minus-trajectory”, then one travels to the past!
The result, however, contains no logical contradiction because one cannot act from
the inside of the sphere with the radius rS on the outside: one only passively receives
signals, i.e. one can “look into the past”.
3.4.3 Singularities
The solution (3.26) has two singularities: a real singularity at r = 0 and an apparent
one at r = rS. The apparent singularity is a so-called coordinate singularity which
could have been avoided by a better coordinate choice. Such a favourable coordinate

In these coordinates, in fact, only a singularity at r∗= 0 exists!
The authenticity of the singularity at r = 0 can be seen by examining the invari-
ants. A function of coordinates is invariant under a transformation if it remains un-
changed applying the transformation to the coordinates. This is precisely the mark
of a true singularity, which does not depend on the randomly selected coordinate
system. Such invariants were already encountered in the investigation of electro-
magnetic ﬁelds and the Lorentz transformation, e.g.

Hence, it is now quite apparent that the only real singularity occurs at r = 0!
Event Horizon Detector
In [13], a possibility is given, how to determine if one
approaches the event horizon (the spherical shell of radius rS) of a black hole or
even exceeds it. To this end, the authors give the invariant
I1 = −720M2(2M −r)
r9
,
which for r = 2M = rS is zero and outside the horizon is positive with a maximum
at r = 9M/4. An observer falling to the black hole can detect the presence of a
horizon by observation of I1. If the event horizon is crossed, it is too late for the
observer. But he may, if the maximum is exceeded, use it as a warning and quickly
initiate the trajectory reversal.
3.4.4 Eddington’s Coordinates
The coordinate singularity at r = rS of the Schwarzschild’s metric can be elimi-
nated, for example, by using the following coordinate transformation.
In (3.81), from the Schwarzschild’s solution we derived

If (3.87) were squared, indeed dr2 would appear, but the parenthesis would have
too much negative power. If one installs, however, the term r∗into a new time
coordinate t∗, then within the Schwarzschild’s metric it would again be multiplied
by

slope is negative, and it is positive for r > rS. The second solution in the (ct∗,r)-
plane is an inclined at 45◦straight line. It shows that the velocity of an ingoing
photon is constant and equal to c. Overall, one obtains Fig. 3.2.

Gravitation of a Spherical Mass
3.5 Rotating Masses
3.5.1 Ansatz for the Metric Matrix G
From a non-rotating mass of radius R generated gravitation effect on the outside,
i.e. for r > R, is described by the Schwarzschild’s metric. A non-rigid rotating mass
bulges out along its equator, so it cannot be described by a Schwarzschild’s metric,
which assumes a symmetric spherical mass. A rotating mass has in addition to the
mass M also an angular momentum J , which is directly proportional to the angular
velocity ω. M and J are the only physical quantities for a rotating black hole that
are required for the physical description of the gravitational ﬁeld and how powerful
the rotating mass is (there are possibly millions of solar masses in a black hole in
the centre of a galaxy)! The Nobel-prize laureate Chandrasekhar has expressed it as:
Rotating black holes are the most perfect macroscopic objects in the uni-
verse. And as the theory of general relativity provides a single, unique, two-
parameter solution for their description, they are also the simplest objects.
For the mathematical description, spatial polar coordinates r,θ and ϕ are se-
lected. The polar axis is the axis of rotation around which the body rotates with
constant angular velocity ω. The elements of the metric matrix G are allowed to
depend neither on the angle θ nor on time t. One can also use a priori, for reasons of
symmetry, some matrix elements equal to zero. Because if one takes a time reﬂection
t →−t, this also changes the direction of rotation ω = dϕ
dt →−ω = −dϕ
dt = d(−ϕ)
dt
.
But if we introduce two transformations t →−t and ϕ →−ϕ simultaneously, then
the gravitational ﬁeld is not allowed to change at all, also the metric matrix G is
not changed. So that being the case, the matrix elements gtθ and gtr must be zero
because in the calculation of the metric here—with the indicated transformations—
dt dθ →−dt dθ and dt dr →−dt dr. And so one can start from the following the
metric matrix which must always be symmetric:
G =
⎛
⎜⎜⎝

gtϕ
0
grr
grθ
0
0
grθ
gθθ
0
gtϕ

⎞
⎟⎟⎠.
The symmetric 2×2-matrix in the centre of the matrix G can be brought to diagonal
form with the help of a similarity transformation so that, without loss of generality,
one may start with the symmetric matrix:
G =
⎛
⎜⎜⎝

and the angular momentum (spin) J per unit mass

As system parameters, in fact, only the two physical parameters occur: the modiﬁed
mass, m, and the angular momentum per unit mass, a! For J = 0, i.e. for a non-
rotating mass, one obtains, of course, the Schwarzschild’s solution.
A simpler form of the solution is obtained for M/r ≪1 and a/r ≪1, i.e. for
weak ﬁelds and slow rotation, namely

Going over in both laws from the action at a distance theory to the theory of con-

ee

one can also write the electric force as

With the appropriate nomenclature for the mechanical parameters and the ﬁeld
strength
em

r2

,
one ﬁnally obtains
f mech = emm2.
If an electric charge is moving, then there is in addition a magnetic ﬁeld b, which
depends on the speed and the load of the charge. The magnetic ﬁeld b acts on the
moving charge q having speed v, generating, together with the electric ﬁeld e, the
force:
f = q

e + 1
c v × b

.
The question now is: Does a moving mass have a similar additional effect to
another moving mass? This is indeed the case, for example, the precession of gyro-
scopes in the vicinity of large rotating masses like the Earth. This ﬁrst was treated
by Föppl [11]. The Austrian physicists Lense and Thirring calculated exactly this
effect from the gravitational equations of Einstein in 1918.
One speaks in this context of a so-called gravitomagnetic ﬁeld in analogy with
classical electromagnetism. To this end, we ﬁrst deﬁne with the help of the angular
momentum J of a spherical rotating mass the ﬁeld
h(r) def
= −2J × r
r3
= −4GMR2
5c3
ω × r
r3
,
(3.95)
where ω is the angular velocity of the rotating mass M with the radius R, and r > R
is the distance from the centre of mass. Next we deﬁne the gravitomagnetic ﬁeld:
¯h def
= ∇× h = 2J −3(r⊺J)r
r3
= 2GMR2
5c2
3(ω⊺r)r −ωr2
r5
.

3.6
Summary of Results for the Gravitation of a Spherical Mass

The angular momentum here thus plays the same role as the magnetic dipole mo-
ment in electrodynamics, and the vector h plays the same role as the vector potential.
In summary, we obtain an analogue of the Lorentz force, namely
md2x
dt2 = m


In the case of stars orbiting close to a spinning, supermassive black hole, the
Lense–Thirring effect should cause the star’s orbital plane to precess about the black
hole’s spin axis. This effect should be detectable within the next few years via as-
trometric monitoring of stars at the centre of the Milky Way galaxy.

The Lense–Thirring effect for a rotating mass generates a gravitomagnetic ﬁeld in
analogy with classical electromagnetism. With the help of the angular momentum
J of a spherical rotating mass, the ﬁeld is (3.95):

where ω is the angular velocity of the rotating mass M with the radius R, and r > R
is the distance from the centre of mass. Then the gravitomagnetic ﬁeld is deﬁned as

3.7 Concluding Remark
In the theory of Special Relativity, the effects are most clearly visible when the
masses move quickly; however, in the theory of General Relativity, the effects are
the greatest when the mass densities are very large and thus the spatial curvature
is very pronounced.

Vectors and Matrices
A.1 Vectors and Matrices
If the speed of a body is given, then its size and the direction need to be identiﬁed.
For the description of such a directional quantity, vectors are used. These vectors
in the three dimensional space require three components which, e.g. in a column
vector, are summarized as follows:
v =
⎛
⎝
v1
v2
v3
⎞
⎠.
(A.1)
A second possibility is to present a transposed column vector
v⊺=
v1
v2
v3

,
(A.2)
a row vector.
In another way, we get the concept of the vector when the following purely math-
ematical problem is considered: Find the solutions of the three coupled equations
with four unknowns x1, x2, x3 and x4:
a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 + a14x4 = y1,
(A.3)
a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 + a24x4 = y2,
(A.4)
a31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 + a34x4 = y3.
(A.5)
The four unknowns are summarized in the vector

(A.8)
With the two vectors x and y and the matrix A, the system of equations can com-
pactly be written as
Ax = y.
(A.9)
If the two systems of equations
a11x1 + a12x2 = y1,
(A.10)
a21x1 + a22x2 = y2
(A.11)
and
a11z1 + a12z2 = v1,
(A.12)
a21z1 + a22z2 = v2
(A.13)
are added, one obtains
a11(x1 + z1) + a12(x2 + z2) = (y1 + v1),
(A.14)
a21(x1 + z1) + a22(x2 + z2) = (y2 + v2).
(A.15)
With the aid of vectors and matrices, the two systems of equations can be written as
Ax = y
and
Az = v.
(A.16)
Adding the two equations in (A.16) is formally accomplished as
Ax + Az = A(x + z) = y + v.
(A.17)
A comparison of (A.17) with (A.14) and (A.15) suggests the following deﬁnition of
the addition of vectors:

(A.19)
A.2 Matrices
A.2.1 Types of Matrices
In the ﬁrst section, the concept of the matrix has been introduced.
Deﬁnition: If a matrix A has n rows and m columns, it is called an n×m matrix
and denoted A ∈Rn×m.
Deﬁnition: If A (with the elements aij) is an n×m matrix, then the transpose of
A, denoted by A⊺, is the m × n matrix with the elements a⊺
ij = aji.
So the matrix (A.8) has the matrix transpose
A⊺=
⎛
⎜⎜⎝
a11
a21
a31
a12
a22
a32
a13
a23

⎟⎟⎠.
(A.20)
In a square matrix, one has n = m; and in an n×n diagonal matrix, all the elements
aij, i ̸= j, outside the main diagonal are equal to zero. An identity matrix I is a
diagonal matrix where all elements on the main diagonal are equal to one. An r × r
identity matrix is denoted by I r. If a transposed matrix A⊺is equal to the original
matrix A, such a matrix is called symmetric. In this case, aij = aji.

A.2.2 Matrix Operations
If the two systems of equations
a11x1 + a12x2 + ··· + a1mxm = y1,
a21x1 + a22x2 + ··· + a2mxm = y2,
...
an1x1 + an2x2 + ··· + anmxm = yn
and
b11x1 + b12x2 + ··· + b1mxm = z1,
b21x1 + b22x2 + ··· + b2mxm = z2,
...
bn1x1 + bn2x2 + ··· + bnmxm = zn
are added, one obtains
(a11 + b11)x1 + (a12 + b12)x2 + ··· + (a1m + b1m)xm = (y1 + z1),
(a21 + b21)x1 + (a22 + b22)x2 + ··· + (a2m + b2m)xm = (y2 + z2),
...
(an1 + bn1)x1 + (an2 + bn2)x2 + ··· + (anm + bnm)xm = (yn + zn),
or, in vector–matrix notation, with
Ax = y
and
Bx = z,
the same can also be written symbolically as
(A + B)x = y + z.
(A.21)
A comparison of the last equations suggests the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition: The sum of two n × m matrices A and B is deﬁned by
A + B =
⎛
⎜⎝
a11

⎞
⎟⎠.
(A.22)

A.2
Matrices

The sum of two matrices can only be formed when both matrices have the same
number of rows and the same number of columns.
If the relations
y = Ax
and
x = Bz
(A.23)
are given, what is the connection between the two vectors y and z? One may write
a11x1 + a12x2 + ··· + a1mxm = y1,
a21x1 + a22x2 + ··· + a2mxm = y2,
...
an1x1 + an2x2 + ··· + anmxm = yn
and
b11z1 + b12z2 + ··· + b1ℓzℓ= x1,
b21z1 + b22z2 + ··· + b2ℓzℓ= x2,
...
bm1z1 + bm2z2 + ··· + bmℓzℓ= xm,
then one obtains, by inserting the xi’s from the latter system of equations into the
former system,
a11(b11z1 + ··· + b1ℓzℓ) + ··· + a1m(bm1z1 + ··· + bmℓzℓ) = y1,
a21(b11z1 + ··· + b1ℓzℓ) + ··· + a2m(bm1z1 + ··· + bmℓzℓ) = y2,
...
an1(b11z1 + ··· + b1ℓzℓ) + ··· + anm(bm1z1 + ··· + bmℓzℓ) = yn.
Combining the terms with zi, we obtain
(a11b11 + ··· + a1mbm1)z1 + ··· + (a11b1ℓ+ ··· + a1mbmℓ)zℓ= y1,
(a21b11 + ··· + a2mbm1)z1 + ··· + (a21b1ℓ+ ··· + a2mbmℓ)zℓ= y2,
...
(an1b11 + ··· + anmbm1)z1 + ··· + (an1b1ℓ+ ··· + anmbmℓ)zℓ= yn.
If, on the other hand, we formally insert the right-hand side of (A.23) into the left
equation, we obtain
y = ABz def
= Cz.

Deﬁnition: The product of an n × m matrix A with an m × ℓmatrix B is the
n × ℓmatrix C with the matrix elements
cij =
m

k=1
aikbkj,
(A.25)
for i = 1,2,...,n and j = 1,2,...,ℓ.
The element cij of the product matrix C is obtained by multiplying the elements of
the ith row of the ﬁrst matrix A with the elements of the jth column of the second
matrix B and adding these products. It follows that the number of columns of the
ﬁrst matrix must be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix, so that the
matrix multiplication can be executed at all. The product matrix has as many rows
as the ﬁrst matrix and as many columns as the second matrix. It follows that, in
general, AB ̸= BA.
We get another matrix operation through the following problem. In
Ax = b,
(A.26)
the 3 × 3 matrix A and the 3 × 1 vector b shall be given. Wanted is the 3 × 1 vector
x that satisﬁes the system of equations (A.26). Written out this is the linear system
of equations:
a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 = b1,
a21x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 = b2,
a31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 = b3.

tained by using Cramer’s rule

Here the adjuncts Aij are the determinants which are obtained when the ith row

A.2.3 Block Matrices
Often large matrices have a certain structure, e.g. when one or more sub-arrays are
zero matrices. On the other hand, one can make a block matrix from each matrix
by drawing vertical and horizontal lines. For a system of equations, one then, for
example, obtains
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝
A11 A12 ··· A1n
A21 A22 ··· A2n
...
...
...
...
Am1 Am2 ··· Amn
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎠
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
x1
x2
...
xn
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
=
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎜⎜⎝
y1
y2
...
ym
⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
.
(A.37)
The Aij’s are called sub-matrices and the vectors xi and yi sub-vectors. For two
appropriately partitioned block matrices, the product may be obtained by simply
carrying out the multiplication as if the sub-matrices were themselves elements:
A11 A12
A21 A22

B11 B12
B21 B22

=
A11B11 + A12B21 A11B12 + A12B22
A21B11 + A22B21 A21B12 + A22B22

.
In particular, the subdivision into blocks of matrices is of beneﬁt for the calcula-
tion of the inverse matrix. Looking at the system of equations
Ax1 + Bx2 = y1,
(A.38)
Cx1 + Dx2 = y2,
(A.39)
or combined into the form
A B
C D

x1
x2

=
y1
y2

,
(A.40)
the inverse of the matrix
M =
A B
C D

(A.41)
can be expressed by more easily calculated inverse sub-matrices. When the matrix
A is invertible, one gets from (A.38)
x1 = A−1y1 −A−1Bx2.
(A.42)
This, used in (A.39), yields
y2 = CA−1y1 −

CA−1B −D

x2
(A.43)
and, solving for x2,
x2 =

CA−1B −D
−1
CA−1y1 −y2

.
(A.44)

A.2
Matrices
153
Equation (A.44) used in (A.42) yields
x1 =

A−1 −A−1B

CA−1B −D
−1CA−1
y1 + A−1B

CA−1B −D
−1y2.
(A.45)
Thus, the solution of the system of equations (A.40) is obtained, namely
x1
x2

= M−1
y1
y2

(A.46)
with
M−1 =

A−1 −A−1B(CA−1B −D)−1CA−1 A−1B(CA−1B −D)−1
(CA−1B −D)−1CA−1
−(CA−1B −D)−1

,
(A.47)
and the inverse matrix of M can be calculated by using the inverse matrices of the
smaller sub-matrices A and (CA−1B −D). If the sub-matrix D is invertible, (A.39)
can be solved for x2, and then, in a similar way, also the inverse matrix of M can
be calculated. One then obtains a different form of the inverted matrix, namely
M−1 =

−(BD−1C −A)−1
(BD−1C −A)−1BD−1
D−1C(BD−1C −A)−1 D−1 −D−1C(BD−1C −A)−1BD−1

.
(A.48)
So there are two different results available for the same matrix. It follows that the
corresponding sub-matrices must be equal. From the comparison of the northwest-
ern blocks, if D is replaced by −D, the known matrix-inversion lemma follows:

A + BD−1C
−1 = A−1 −A−1B

CA−1B + D
−1CA−1.
(A.49)
A special case occurs when we have a block-triangular matrix, for example, if
C = O. Then we obtain
 A B

Here, the sub-matrix Cij ∈Rp×q, for i = 1 to n and j = 1 to m, is

Permutation matrices have the following characteristics [4]:
U⊺
p×q = Uq×p,
(A.58)
U−1
p×q = Uq×p,
(A.59)
Up×1 = U1×p = I p,

A.4
Derivatives of Vectors/Matrices with Respect to Vectors/Matrices
157
Permutation matrices are mainly used to change the order of the factors in a
Kronecker-product because
Us×p(B ⊗A)Uq×t = A ⊗B
if A ∈Rp×q and B ∈Rs×t.
(A.62)
A.3.4 More Properties of the Kronecker-Product
The following important properties are listed also without proof (see [4]):
(A ⊗B) ⊗C = A ⊗(B ⊗C),
(A.63)
(A ⊗B)⊺= A⊺⊗B⊺,
(A.64)
(A ⊗B)(C ⊗D) = AC ⊗BD.

A.4 Derivatives of Vectors/Matrices with Respect to

A.4.1 Deﬁnitions
Deﬁnition: The derivative of a matrix A ∈Rn×m with respect to a matrix M ∈
Rr×s is deﬁned as follows:
∂A

⎞
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎠
(A.67)
the deﬁnition of the derivative (A.66) is also written as
∂A
∂M
def
=
∂
∂M ⊗A.
(A.68)

For the derivatives of vectors with respect to vectors one has:

∂p ⊗f ⊺=

(A.71)
A.4.2 Product Rule
Let A = A(α) and B = B(α). Then we obviously have
∂(AB)
∂α
= ∂A
∂α B + A∂B
∂α .
(A.72)
In addition, (A.66) can be rewritten as:
∂A
∂M =

i,k
Es×t

⊗∂A
∂mik
,
M ∈Rs×t.
(A.73)
Using (A.72) and (A.73), this product rule can be derived:
∂(AB)
∂M

∂M .

A.4.3 Chain Rule
When a matrix A ∈Rn×m is a function of a matrix B ∈Rk×ℓwhich is again a
function of a matrix M ∈Rr×s, then the chain rule is valid [4]:
∂
∂M A

B(M)


I r ⊗
∂A
∂(vec(B⊺))⊺

∂vec(B⊺)

(A.75)
A special case of this is
dA(x(t))

A.5 Differentiation with Respect to Time
A.5.1 Differentiation of a Function with Respect to Time
Suppose a function a that depends on the three space variables x1,x2 and x3 is given.
The local space variables themselves are, in turn, dependent on the time parameter t.
So it is
a = a

x(t)

,
(A.77)
if the three space variables are summarized in the vector x.
We want to ﬁnd the velocity
˙a = da
dt .
(A.78)
To determine this velocity, we ﬁrst deﬁne the total difference
△a def
= ∂a
∂x1
△x1 + ∂a
∂x2
△x2 + ∂a
∂x3
△x3.
(A.79)
After division by △t, in the limit △t →0, one has
˙a = da
dt = lim
△t→0
△a
△t = ∂a
∂x1
˙x1 + ∂a
∂x2
˙x2 + ∂a
∂x3
˙x3.
(A.80)
The right-hand side of this equation can be presented by the scalar product of the
column vectors ˙x and ∂a
∂x in two ways, namely
˙a = ˙x⊺∂a
∂x = ∂a
∂x⊺˙x.

A.5.2 Differentiation of a Vector with Respect to Time
If two functions a1 and a2 are given, they have the same dependence on time t as
a(t) in (A.77), and are summarized in the column vector
a def
=
a1(x(t))
a2(x(t))

,
(A.82)
we obtain initially for the derivative with respect to time using (A.81)
˙a =

The next-to-last vector in (A.83) can be decomposed as follows:

.
(A.84)
Computing the last Kronecker-product, we would formally get ai ∂
∂x which, of
course, should be understood as ∂ai
∂x . With the help of the permutation matrix Uα×β
and the exchange rule (A.62)
(A ⊗B) = Us×p(B ⊗A)Uq×t
if A ∈Rp×q and B ∈Rs×t,
in the appendix, the last product in (A.84) can be written
˙a =

Appendix B
Some Differential Geometry
From a sheet of letter paper, one can form a cylinder or a cone, but it is impossible
to obtain a surface element of a sphere without folding, stretching or cutting. The
reason lies in the geometry of the spherical surface: No part of such a surface can
be isometrically mapped onto the plane.
B.1 Curvature of a Curved Line in Three Dimensions
In a plane, the tangent vector remains constant when one moves on it: the plane has
no curvature. The same is true for a straight line when the tangent vector coincides
with the line. If a line in a neighbourhood of one of its points is not a straight line, it
is called a curved line. The same is valid for a curved surface. We consider curves in
the three-dimensional space with the position vector x(q) of points parametrized by
the length q. The direction of a curve C at the point x(q) is given by the normalized
tangent vector
t(q) def
=
x′(q)
∥x′(q)∥,
with x′(q) def
= ∂x(q)
∂q . Passing through a curve from a starting point x(q0) to an end-
point x(q) does not change the tangent vector t in a straight line, the tip of the
tangent vector does not move, thus describing a curve of length 0. If the curve is
curved, then the tip of the tangent vector describes an arc of length not equal to
zero. As arc length we call the integral over a curved arc with endpoints q0 and q

A measure of the curvature of a curve is the rate of change of the direction. The
curvature is larger when the change of direction of the tangent vector t is greater.

A straight line has zero curvature. In the case of a circle, the curvature is con-

curvature is called the curvature radius.
B.2 Curvature of a Surface in Three Dimensions
B.2.1 Vectors in the Tangent Plane
Already in the nineteenth century, Gauss investigated how from the measurements
on a surface one can make conclusions about its spatial form. He then came to his
main result, the Theorema Egregium, which states that the Gaussian curvature of a

B.2

167
surface depends only on the internal variables gij and their derivatives. This result
is deduced in the following.
Suppose an area is deﬁned as a function x(q1,q2) ∈R3 of the two coordinates
q1 and q2. At a point P of the surface, the tangent plane is, for example, spanned by
the two tangent vectors x1
def
= ∂x
∂q1 and x2
def
= ∂x
∂q2 . If the two tangent vectors x1 and
x2 are linearly independent, any vector in the tangent plane can be decomposed in
a linear combination of the two vectors, e.g. as
v1x1 + v2x2.
The scalar product of two vectors from the tangent plane is then deﬁned as
(v · w) def

⎠w = v⊺Gw.
As x⊺
1 x2 = x⊺
2 x1, the matrix G⊺= G is symmetric. In addition, one has
∥v∥=

(v · v) =
√
v⊺Gv.
Now we want to deﬁne the curvature by oriented parallelograms. Let v ∧w be the
oriented parallelogram deﬁned by the vectors v and w in that order. w∧v = −v ∧w
is then the parallelogram with the opposite orientation, area(w∧v) = −area(v ∧w).
The determinant of the matrix G is then obtained as
g def
= detG = ∥x1∥2 · ∥x2∥2 −(x1 · x2)2
= ∥x1∥2 · ∥x2∥2 −∥x1∥2 · ∥x2∥2 cos2 Θ
= ∥x1∥2 · ∥x2∥2


= ∥x1∥2 · ∥x2∥2 sin2 Θ.
On the other hand, one has ∥x1 × x2∥= ∥x1∥· ∥x2∥· sinΘ, and so
∥x1 × x2∥= √g = area(x1 ∧x2).
(B.6)
For the vector product of two vectors v and w from the tangent plane, one gets, on
the other hand,

or
area(v ∧w) = detR · area(x1 ∧x2),
so
area(v ∧w) = detR √g.
(B.7)
The area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors in the tangential surface is
thus determined by the vector components and the surface deﬁning the matrix G.
B.2.2 Curvature and Normal Vectors
For two-dimensional surfaces, one should deﬁne the curvature at a point without
using the tangent vectors directly because there are inﬁnitely many of them in the
tangent plane. However, any smooth surface in R3 has at each point a unique normal
direction, which is one-dimensional, so it can be described by the unit normal vector.
A normal vector at x(q) is deﬁned as the normalized vector perpendicular to the
tangent plane:
n(q) def
=
x1 × x2
∥x1 × x2∥.
If the surface is curved, the normal vector changes with displacement according to
ni(q) def
= ∂n(q)
∂qi .
These change vectors ni lie in the tangent plane because
∂(n · n)
∂qi
= 0 =
 ∂n
∂qi · n

+

n · ∂n
∂qi

= 2(ni · n).
The bigger the area spanned by the two change vectors n1 and n2 lying in the tangent
plane, the bigger the curvature at the considered point. If Ω is an area of the tangent
surface which contains the point under consideration, then the following curvature
deﬁnition is obvious:
κ(q) def
= lim
Ω→q
area of n(Ω)
area of Ω
= lim
Ω→q
**
Ω ∥n1(˜q) × n2(˜q)∥d˜q1 d˜q2
**
Ω ∥x1(˜q) × x2(˜q)∥d˜q1 d˜q2
= ∥n1(q) × n2(q)∥
∥x1(q) × x2(q)∥= area of n1(q) ∧n2(q)
area of x1(q) ∧x2(q).
(B.8)
Since both n1 and n2 lie in the tangent plane, they can be displayed as linear com-
binations of the vectors x1 and x2:
n1 = −b1
1x1 −b2
1x2
and
n2 = −b1
2x1 −b2
2x2.

Combining together the coefﬁcients −bj
i in the matrix B, this corresponds to the
matrix R in (B.7), and (B.6) then yields the Gauss-curvature
κ(q) = detB.
(B.10)
To conﬁrm the Theorema Egregium of Gauss, one must now shown that B depends
only on the inner values gij and their derivatives!
B.2.3 Theorema Egregium and the Inner Values gij
First, we examine the changes of the tangent vectors xk by looking at their deriva-
tives
xjk
def
= ∂xk
∂qj =
∂2x
∂qj∂qk ,
(B.11)
which implies that
xjk = xkj.
(B.12)
Since the two vectors x1 and x2 are a basis for the tangent plane and the vector n is
orthonormal to this plane, any vector in R3, including the vector xjk, can assembled
as a linear combination of these three vectors:
xjk = Γ 1
jkx1 + Γ 2
jkx2 + bjkn.
(B.13)
The vectors xjk can be summarized in a 4 × 2-matrix as follows:
∂2x
∂q∂q⊺=

= Γ 1 ⊗x1 + Γ 2 ⊗x2 + B ⊗n,

Some Differential Geometry
i.e. the 2 × 2-matrix B is symmetric. This matrix is called the Second Fundamen-
tal Form of the surface. The First Quadratic Fundamental Form is given by the
connection
G = ∂x⊺
∂q · ∂x
∂q⊺,
(B.16)
or more precisely, by the right-hand side of the equation for the squared line element
ds of the surface:
ds2 = dq⊺Gdq.
Gauss designates, as is still in elementary geometry today, the elements of the matrix
G in this way:
G =
E
F

.
While G therefore plays a critical role in determining the length of a curve in an area,
B is, as we will see later, decisively involved in the determination of the curvature
of a surface. A further representation of the matrix B is obtained from the derivative
of the scalar product of the mutually orthogonal vectors n and xi:
n⊺∂x
∂q⊺= 0⊺;
because this derivative is, according to (A.73),

This used in (B.18) together with (B.16) yields

∂q⊺= −B⊺G,

B = −GB,
(B.20)
since B and G are both symmetric matrices. Our goal remains to show that the
Gaussian curvature depends only on the gij’s and their derivatives with respect to
qk, i.e., according to (B.10), one must show that for the matrix B
κ(q) = detB
is valid. We ﬁrst examine the matrix G. For this purpose, its elements are differen-
tiated:

Remarks
1. Euclidean geometry of is based on a number of Axioms that require no proofs.
One is the parallel postulate stating that to every line one can draw through a
point not belonging to it one and only one other line which lies in the same plane
and does not intersect the former line. This axiom is replaced in the hyperbolic
geometry in that it admits inﬁnitely many parallels. An example is the surface
of a hyperboloid. In the elliptical geometry, for example, on the surface of an
ellipsoid and, as a special case, on a spherical surface, there are absolutely no
parallels because all great circles, which are here the “straight lines”, meet in

two points. In Euclidean geometry, the distance between two points with the
Cartesian coordinates x1,x2,x3 and x1 + dx1,x2 + dx2,x3 + dx3 is simply
ds =

dx2
1 + dx2
2 + dx2
3,
and in the other two geometries this formula is replaced by
ds2 = a1 dx2
1 + a2 dx2
2 + a3 dx2
3,
where the coefﬁcients ai are certain simple functions of xi, in the hyperbolic
case, of course, different than in the elliptic case. A convenient analytical repre-
sentation of curved surfaces is the above used Gaussian parameter representation
x = x(q1,q2), where Gauss attaches as curved element:
ds2 = E dq2
1 + 2F dq1 dq2 + Gdq2
2.
As an example, we introduce the Gauss-speciﬁc parameter representation of the
unit sphere, with θ = q1 and ϕ = q2:
x1 = sinθ cosϕ,
x2 = sinθ sinϕ,
x3 = cosϕ.
For the arc element of the unit sphere, we obtain
ds2 = dθ2 + sin2 θ(dϕ)2.
Riemann generalized the Gaussian theory of surfaces, which is valid for
two-dimensional surfaces in three-dimensional spaces, to p-dimensional hyper-
surfaces in n-dimensional spaces, i.e. where
x = x(q1,...,qp) ∈Rn
is a point on the hypersurface. He made in addition the fundamentally important
step, to set up a homogeneous quadratic function of dqi with arbitrary functions
of the qi as coefﬁcients, as the square of the line elements (quadratic form)

(B.39)
The so-deﬁned normal curvature depends, in general, on the chosen direc-
tion dq. Those directions, in which the normal curvatures at a given point as-
sume an extreme value, are named the main directions of the surface at this
point. As long as we examine real surfaces, the quadratic differential form
E dq2
1 + 2F dq1 dq2 + Gdq2
2 is positive deﬁnite, i.e. it is always positive for
dq ̸= 0. Thus the sign of the curvature depends only on the quadratic differential
form Ldq2
1 + 2M dq1 dq2 + N dq2
2 in the numerator of (B.39). There are three
cases:
(a) LN −M2 > 0, i.e. B is positive deﬁnite, and the numerator retains the same
sign, in each direction one is looking. Such a point is called an elliptical
point. An example is any point on an ellipsoid, in particular, of course, on a
sphere.
(b) LN −M2 = 0, i.e. B is semi-deﬁnite. The surface behaves at this point as at
an elliptical point except in one direction where is κ = 0. This point is called
parabolic. An example is any point on a cylinder.

(c) LN −M2 < 0, i.e. B is indeﬁnite. The numerator does not keep the same
sign for all directions. Such a point is called hyperbolic, or a saddle point.
An example is a point on a hyperbolic paraboloid.
Dividing the numerator and the denominator in (B.39) by dq2 and introducing
dq1/dq2
def

κ(λ) = L + 2Mλ + Nλ2
E + 2Fλ + Gλ2

(F + Gλ) = 0.
(B.41)
In this case, the resulting expression for κ is
κ = L + 2Mλ + Nλ2
E + 2Fλ + Gλ2 = M + Nλ
F + Gλ .
(B.42)
Since furthermore
E + 2Fλ + Gλ2 = (E + Fλ) + λ(F + Gλ)
and
L + 2Mλ + Nλ2 = (L + Mλ) + λ(M + Nλ),
(B.40) can be transformed into the simpler form
κ = L + Mλ
E + Fλ .
(B.43)
From this the two equations for κ follow:
(κE −L) + (κF −M)λ = 0,
(κF −M) + (κG −N)λ = 0.
These equations are simultaneously satisﬁed if and only if

κG −B = 0,
which can be transformed into
κI −G−1B = 0.
(B.46)
This results in a quadratic equation for κ. The two solutions are called the principal
curvatures and are denoted as κ1 and κ2. The Gaussian curvature κ of a surface at a
given point is the product of the principal curvatures κ1 and κ2 of the surface in this
point. According to Vieta’s root theorem, the product of the solutions is equal to the
determinant of the matrix G−1B, so ﬁnally,

Appendix C
Geodesic Deviation
Geodesics are the lines of general manifolds along which, for example, free particles
move. In a ﬂat space the relative velocity of each pair of particles is constant, so that
their relative acceleration is always equal to zero. Generally, due to the curvature of
space, the relative acceleration is not equal to zero.
The curvature of a surface can be illustrated as follows [21]. Suppose there are
two ants on an apple which leave a starting line at the same time and follow with
the same speed geodesics which are initially perpendicular to the start line. Initially,
their paths are parallel, but, due to the curvature of the apple, they are approaching
each other from the beginning. Their distance ξ from one another is not constant,
i.e., in general, the relative acceleration of the ants moving on geodesics with con-
stant velocity is not equal zero if the area over which they move is curved. So the
curvature can be indirectly perceived through the so-called geodesic deviation ξ.
The two neighboring geodesics x(u) and ˇx(u) have the distance
ξ(u) def
= ˇx(u) −x(u),
(C.1)
where u is the proper time or distance.
The mathematical descriptions of these geodesics are

solution is the linear relationship ξ(u) = ˙ξ0 · u + ξ0. If R ̸= 0, gravity exists and the

Symmetry of the Ricci-Matrix RRic
Even if R itself is not symmetric, the from
R derived Ricci-matrix RRic is symmetric; this will be shown in the following. The
symmetry will follow from the components equation (D.10) of the Ricci-matrix.
One sees immediately that the second and fourth summands are symmetric in α
and β.
The symmetry of the term (3
γ =0
∂
∂xβ Γ γ
αγ in α and β is not seen directly. This can
be checked using the Laplace-expansion theorem for determinants.1 Developing the
determinant of G along the γ th row yields
g def
= det(G) = gγ 1Aγ 1 + ··· + gγβAγβ + ··· + gγ nAγ n,
1The sum of the products of all elements of a row (or column) with their adjuncts is equal to the
determinant’s value.

where Aγβ is the element in the γ th row and βth column of the adjoint of G. If g[−1]
βγ
is the (βγ )th element of the inverse of G, then g[−1]
βγ
= 1
g Aγβ, so Aγβ = g g[−1]
βγ .
Thus we obtain

If we now set α = β and sum over α, we will again arrive at (D.17).
