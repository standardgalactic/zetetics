 GALACTIC EXPERIMENTS WITH
 DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION

 Experiments have been conducted with a two-dimensional model of a
 galaxy, consisting of 2000 rods of mass. Varying amounts of differential
 rotation are given to a bar and a cylindrical galaxy. Spiral and loop structures
 are formed and in one case an S-shaped density wave is seen to grow from a
 symmetric cylinder. This wave is expected to be a long-lived feature in a
 real galaxy with a negligible collision rate.
 I. Introduction
 In a previous paper (Hockney 1967) the writer described com-
 puter experiments with a galactic model of 2000 rod-like stars.
 These experiments showed the evolution of a cylindrical galaxy
 of stars when given different initial amounts of solid-body rota-
 tion. When the rotation was insufficient to balance gravitational
 attraction short-lived spiral and barred spiral structures were
 observed which showed a similarity to some real galaxies. These
 structures existed for only a fraction of a galactic rotation and
 after five rotations a structureless equilibrium distribution, similar
 to an elliptical galaxy, was reached. In one case a spiral changed
 to a barred spiral in one-fifth of a rotation. Very similar computer
 experiments have been conducted by Hohl ( 1967a,6) using 500 and
 4000 stars. In this communication we describe further experiments
 concerned with the influence of differential rotation on the evolu-
 tion of both a bar and cylindrical galaxy.
 II. Experiments with a Bar
 The tendency of rotating star systems to form filamentary con-
 densations has previously been observed (Hockney 1967 plate 5 at
 t = 0.5; Hohl 1967a,&). These condensations can equally well be

 regarded as embryo galaxies condensing from the pr
 medium. It is realistic therefore to study the evolution 
 elongated star systems.
 The stars were initially placed at random within a
 with a ratio of major to minor axes of ten. The avera
 was constant although there were small deviations due t
 of only 2000 stars. The initial velocities were chosen t
 mately balance gravitational attraction. The 2000 stars w
 ellipse were used to simulate the bar of the galaxy. The 
 the galaxy was represented by a single fixed mass r
 center of the system. Three values (O, 0.5, 2.0) were tak
 ratio of the mass of the nucleus to the mass of the bar.
 Figure 1 shows the development of the bar in the ab
 nucleus. The dominant feature is the formation of a bin
 which lasts for three rotations. After three rotations the two
 systems merge and form a structureless galaxy. Figure 2 shows
 the case of a small nucleus equal to half the total mass of the
 bar stars. During the first two rotations the bar contracts and is
 wrapped up into a spiral structure by the differential rotation.
 Comparisons between real galaxies with an r2 force law between
 stars and the results from the computer model of rod-like "stars"
 with an r1 force must be viewed with considerable caution. How-
 ever, one cannot help but note the striking similarity between the
 computed structure after one rotation and the whirlpool galaxy
 (M 51). After 2.5 rotations the two spiral arms have merged to form
 two intersecting elliptical rings. Such structures are not observed
 frequently in the sky, but there is a similarity between NGC 2523
 (Sandage 1961, plate 48) and the computed galaxy at 2.2 rotations.
 By five rotations all structure has disappeared. Similar results are
 obtained with a nucleus equal to twice the mass of the bar, only
 now the differential rotation is greater and the ring pattern appears
 sooner. Again all structure has disappeared after five rotations.
 In these experiments there are two effects tending to wash
 out spiral structure in the galaxy. The first effect is real and is the
 differential rotation which, after producing spirals from the bar
 in the first place, changes the spiral arms into an interlocking
 ring system by further wrapping up and finally merging the arms.
 The second effect is due to deficiencies in the computer model.
 The use of 2000 stars instead of 1011 stars in a real galaxy vastly
 increases the collision rate and reduces the relaxation time. The

 effect of these collisions is to increase the velocity dispersion of
 the star system. The collision time in the model has been estimated
 to be about sixteen rotations (Hockney 1967). In this estimate
 the collision time is the time required for the velocity dispersion
 to become equivalent to a Jeans length equal to the diameter of
 the galaxy. Clearly no structure can remain after this time unless
 there is an active gravitational instability to support it. Similarly
 a spiral arm with a diameter less than one-fifth of the system
 cannot be maintained longer than one-fifth of a collision time-
 that is to say longer than about three rotations. The loss of

 have been turned into ring structures by the different
 before this. However, to be confident about how long a
 spiral structure will last, one must await experiments w
 or 100,000 stars. In this case collisions will not become 
 until after about 50 rotations. Such experiments are no

 or nucleus at the center. The ratio of mass of the nucleus to
 mass of the disk was taken as 0.5, 2.0 and 10.0. We find that the
 flutes are not drawn out into spirals and that the amount of
 fluting decreases as the amount of differential rotation increases.
 For a nucleus with ten times the mass of the disk there is no
 evidence of flutes.
 The fluting of a uniform cylinder occurs where the density
 gradient is highest- namely at the edge. This suggested that a
 gradual density gradient throughout the galaxy might produce a
 structure in the interior of the galaxy. To test this possibility we
 have conducted two experiments with a balanced rotating cylinder
 with no nucleus. The density, however, varies inversely as the
 radius, and in the balanced condition this results in differential
 rotation in which angular frequency varies inversely as the square
 root of the radius. A combination of density gradient and differen-
 tial rotation occurs in real galaxies and also in the theory of Lin
 and Shu (1965) which predicts the presence of density waves.
 Figure 3 shows the first case. Multiple spiral features are
 visible at half a rotation after which an S-shaped density wave
 appears. The wave is faintly visible at 1.5 rotations and grows for
 the next three rotations, being clearly visible at 4.5 rotations.
 Another calculation for a slightly smaller galaxy has been made
 which again showed the S-shaped density wave. The wave reached
 a maximum amplitude at five rotations and subsequently decayed
 due to the exaggerated effect of collisions. The wave was no
 longer visible after seven rotations. It is to be expected that the
 wave would have a longer lifetime in a real galaxy with a neglible
 collision rate.

 IV. Movie Film
 A 16-mm movie film has been made from these computer experi-
 ments together with those described earlier (Hockney 1967). Th
 star distribution at each time-step of the calculation is plotted
 on 35-mm microfilm using a Stromberg Carlson 4020 microfilm
 recorder. This film, when reduced photographically to 16 mm and
 projected at 16 frames per second, gives a dramatic visual display
 of the experiments. Figures 1-3 are still frames taken at intervals
 from this movie. An early version of the film was shown to the
 meeting of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific at Pasadena
 (June 1967), and the final version to the International Astronomical
 Union colloquium on the Gravitational Problem of N Bodies a
 Paris, France (August 1967).
 The writer would like to thank Profs. P. A. Sturrock and O.
 Buneman for encouraging the application of computer models to
 the galactic problem. The work was sponsored by the Air Force
 under contract AF 49(638)1321. The calculations were performed
 at the Stanford Computation Center and the film was made on
 the Lockheed Stromberg-Carlson 4020 facility.
