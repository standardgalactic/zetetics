Double-slit experiments—where a wave is transmitted through a thin 
double aperture in space—have confirmed the wave–particle duality of 
quantum objects, such as single photons, electrons, neutrons, atoms and 
large molecules. Yet, the temporal counterpart of Young’s double-slit 
experiment—a wave interacting with a double temporal modulation of an 
interface—remains elusive. Here we report such a time-domain version of 
the classic Young’s double-slit experiment: a beam of light twice gated in 
time produces an interference in the frequency spectrum. The ‘time slits’, 
narrow enough to produce diffraction at optical frequencies, are generated 
from the optical excitation of a thin film of indium tin oxide near its 
epsilon-near-zero point. The separation between time slits determines the 
period of oscillations in the frequency spectrum, whereas the decay of fringe 
visibility in frequency reveals the shape of the time slits. Surprisingly, many 
more oscillations are visible than expected from existing theory, implying 
a rise time that approaches an optical cycle. This result enables the further 
exploration of time-varying physics, towards the spectral synthesis of waves 
and applications such as signal processing and neuromorphic computation.
Wave–matter interaction in time-varying media exhibits strikingly 
different dynamics than in conventional passive media. As energy can 
be exchanged between the wave and medium, the wave frequency 
changes, and the propagation is no longer symmetric under an inver-
sion of time. Temporal diffraction of matter waves was predicted by 
Moshinsky in 19521 and has been observed as a few oscillations in the 
particle arrival time2–4. Amidst the recent explosion of studies on optical 
time-varying media5, time refraction6–8 and time reversal9 have been 
achieved in epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) semiconductors, for example, 
indium tin oxide (ITO)10,11, modulated by ultrafast laser pulses.
In this Article, we report the observation of the temporal analogue 
of a double-slit experiment for light waves, showing a clear signature 
of spectral oscillations for time-diffracted light, and an inversely pro-
portional relation between slit separation and period of oscillations. 
Moreover, the observed oscillations serve as a sensitive probe of the 
ITO response time, which we measure to be of the order of an optical 
cycle, much faster than previously thought.
In the conventional Young’s double-slit experiment, the diffracted 
pattern has a characteristic oscillatory profile, with minima corre-
sponding to momenta k for which destructive interference suppresses 
wave propagation (Fig. 1a). These minima have a separation in momen-
tum space that increases for decreasing spatial separation of the slits. 
In the Fraunhofer approximation of diffraction, that is, for aperture 
size much smaller than the observation distance, the field distribution 
in the far field can be approximated as the Fourier transform ̄A(kx) of 
the aperture function A(x) (Fig. 1b). The far-field interference pattern 
can be plotted in a dispersion diagram, where it is described as hori-
zontal transitions (Fig. 1c), with new modes appearing, characterized

Direct evidence of time diffraction from the temporal double slit is 
given by illuminating the sample with a probe pulse (230.2 THz carrier 
frequency and 1.0 THz bandwidth) of duration 794 fs (FWHM) and by 
monitoring the reflected probe spectrum. The probe pulse is spectrally 
broadened, exhibiting new frequency content up to ~10 bandwidths away 
from the carrier frequency. A clear spectral modulation, with sinusoidal 
oscillations, is evident in Fig. 2a,b (red lines), shown for two different 
time-slit separations. Measurements with 800 fs slit temporal separation 
(Fig. 2a) present much faster oscillations than with 500 fs (Fig. 2b). The 
separation of the time slits determines the period of oscillations in the 
frequency spectrum, whereas the shape of each time slit constrains the 
oscillation decay and therefore the number of oscillations that are vis-
ible. Up to six oscillations in the spectrum are evident (Fig. 2a,b), with an 
overall decay in intensity away from the central frequency of the probe.
These spectral oscillations are very well captured by a simple 
diffraction model (Fig. 2a,b, purple line). This model calculates the 
spectral evolution of the probe from the Fourier transform of the 
product of the time-varying reflection coefficient r(t), that is, the slit 
aperture function, and the probe-pulse temporal profile. In such a 
model, the slit separation and decay time of each slit are fixed by the 
pump–probe data (Extended Data Fig. 1), whereas the rise time is taken 
as a fitting parameter.
The oscillation decay with increasing change in frequency depends 
on the shape of the time slits, particularly their rise time. Therefore, the 
measured spectral oscillations act as a very precise measurement of 
the ITO response time, with a resolution well beyond that of a conven-
tional pump–probe experiment. Here, we find unexpected physics: 
many more oscillations are visible than expected from existing theory, 
implying a rise time for the leading edge estimated to be 1.0–10.0 fs, 
that is, of the order of an optical cycle (4.4 fs); this is much faster than 
previously thought6–8, although recent work has shown the evidence 
of a speeding up of the response time for pump intensities beyond 
the linear regime12. Moreover, the oscillations are very close to the 
asymptotic limit of an ideal time slit with a Heaviside (infinitely fast) 
rise profile, for which the amplitude of the oscillations is expected to 
decay as 1/(f – f0)2, where f is the frequency of oscillation and f0 is the 
probe central frequency (230.2 THz). This is evident when the spec-
trum is rescaled by the square of the inverse frequency, as its intensity 
is almost constant (Fig. 2c,d). The dashed purple line in Fig. 2c,d is the 
asymptotic theory with two Heaviside time slits (Extended Data Fig. 2).
The signature of time diffraction is further revealed by the period 
of these oscillations, which is inversely proportional to slit separation 
(Fig. 2e). The agreement between the measured data (open circles) 
and model is remarkable. The error bars show the accuracy of the slit 
separation (50 fs) and period (<0.15 THz). The shaded area identifies 
time-slit separations smaller than 300 fs where the two time slits start 
to merge and the oscillations are not visible anymore.
Further insight into the temporal diffraction process can be 
achieved by analysing the full interferogram of the time-diffracted 
light as a function of slit separation (Fig. 2f). Oscillations appear more 
pronounced on the red side of the spectrum with frequencies as far 
out as 10 THz (~60 nm) and only exhibiting frequencies 4 THz away 
on the blue side (on top of the probe-pulse initial spectral content of 
1 THz width). The asymmetric interferogram is explained by the time 
evolution of the phase of the complex reflection coefficient, causing 
a Doppler shift in the spectrum, often dubbed time refraction13. The 
theoretical plot (Fig. 2g) does not capture this asymmetry, as it does 
not include a phase change during reflection. The observed spectral 
redshift is reproduced when using a dispersive material-based model 
that includes a time modulation of the phase of the reflection coef-
ficient (Extended Data Figure 3c).
Outlook
In conclusion, we report a direct observation of spectral oscillations—
at optical frequencies—resulting from double-slit time diffraction, the 
by different momenta but the same frequency, as required by temporal 
translational invariance.
In the temporal domain, in the corresponding scenario, a temporal 
double slit comprises a deeply subwavelength slab characterized  
by a time-varying dielectric function that is an aperture function A(t) 
defining two time slits (Fig. 1d). In this case, the wave will be time dif-
fracted into a frequency spectrum of frequencies ̄A(ω)—the Fourier 
transform of the aperture function A(t)—around the incident carrier 
frequency (Fig. 1e), whereas the in-plane momentum kx will be  
conserved by translational symmetry (Fig. 1f).
Experimental results
Experimentally, we create time slits by inducing an ultrafast change in 
the complex reflection coefficient of a time-varying mirror12 made of a 
40 nm thin film of ITO, with an ENZ frequency of 227 THz (1,320 nm). 
The film is deposited on a glass coverslip and covered by a 100 nm layer 
of gold to improve field confinement and reflectivity (Fig. 1g). The 
time modulation is driven by two 225 fs full-width at half-maximum 
(FWHM) pulses at 230.2 THz (1,300 nm) that impinge near the Berreman 
angle (60°), ensuring efficient field coupling and enhanced nonlinear 
response in ITO (Methods). We measure the temporal double slit by 
a pump–probe experiment (Fig. 1h, blue line). The reflectivity of the 
sample changes from 0.08 to 0.60, giving a modulation contrast of 
76% for pump intensities around 124 GW cm–2, large enough to saturate 
the mirror response (Extended Data Fig. 1). The measured reflectivity 
has the shape of a double time slit, with a fast rise time and slow decay, 
given by the convolution of driving pump pulses, probe and material 
response. The time-slit separation can be tuned by adjusting the relative 
delay of the two pump pulses via a delay line. The same pump–probe 
experiment on a glass or gold layer yields no measurable modulation 
of the spectrum. This is to be expected for gold from the negligible 
penetration of the layer by the field (3.7%) and its Kerr coefficient is 
smaller than in ITO, whereas for SiO2, the Kerr nonlinearities are four 
orders of magnitude smaller than in ITO, thereby making any time 
modulation within the layer negligible.

temporal analogue of Young’s slit experiment. The measurements 
show clear inverse proportionality between the oscillation period 
and time-slit separation. These oscillations reveal 1–10 fs temporal 
dynamics of the ITO/gold bilayer, much faster than previously thought 
and beyond the adiabatic and linear intensity dependence assumed so 
far in most theoretical models6,7,13, but compatible with recent model-
ling14, calling for a new fundamental understanding of such ultrafast 
non-equilibrium responses. The observation of temporal Young’s 
double-slit diffraction paves the way for the optical realizations of 
time-varying metamaterials, promising enhanced wave functionali-
ties such as non-reciprocity15, new forms of gain16,17, time reversal18,19 
and optical Floquet topology20,21. The visibility of oscillations can be 
used to measure the phase coherence of the wave interacting with it, 
similar to wave–matter interferometers22. Double-slit time diffrac-
tion could be extended to other wave domains, for example, matter 
waves22, optomechanics23 and acoustics24,25, electronics26, and spin-
tronics27, with applications for pulse shaping, signal processing and 
neuromorphic computation.

Methods
Temporal and spectral characterization of probe and pump 
pulses
All the pulses are generated by a PHAROS (Light Conversion) solid-state 
laser, set to 230.2 THz with a Light Conversion’s ORPHEUS optical para-
metric amplifier, with a nominal FWHM of the electric-field envelope 
of 225 fs. The pulses are roughly Gaussian in shape.
For the double-slit experiment, a probe pulse identical to the pump 
pulse is sent through a 4f system, composed of a diffraction grating, var-
iable aperture and two lenses, which separates, filters and recombines 
different spectral components to broaden the pulse in time, to make it 
longer than the time-slit separation. By selecting the spectral content of 
the probe beam with an aperture (Extended Data Fig. 3d (pink line); the 
original spectrum in beige is given for reference), the pulse is extended 
in time. This is quantified by using cross-correlation measurements, 
where we collect the sum-frequency-generated signal originating from 
the spatial overlap of the probe and pump pulses in a 400-µm-thick 
gallium phosphide crystal with second-order nonlinearity.
As the analytical solution to the cross-correlation measurement 
is known for a Gaussian pulse, we fit the FWHM of the probe-pulse 
amplitude assuming such a shape following the measurement of the 
sum frequency generated between the pump and probe pulses (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1). The agreement between theory and experiment 
shows that this is a well-suited approximation for the main peak of the 
probe envelope. For reference, the pristine pump pulse autocorrelation 
measurement and fit are also measured. The probe pulse is measured 
to have 794 ± 37 fs FWHM, whereas the original pump pulse is recorded 
to have 225 ± 5 fs FWHM, close to the device specifications. These values 
refer to the electric-field amplitude of the pulse; the corresponding 
intensity FWHM are √2 shorter.
Modelling of the slits
We model a single-slit aperture function as:
fss (t) =
1
(1 + e−αt) × (1 + eβt)
,
where α and β are taken to be positive constants. The double-slit 
modulation profile of the amplitude reflection coefficient can then 
be expressed as r (t) = A × fss (t −
S
2 ) + B × fss (t +
S
2 ) + C,where S is the 
slit separation, A and B are the respective slit amplitudes, and C is a 
constant corresponding to the unmodulated reflection coefficient 
of the time-varying mirror. This function is normalized by fitting it 
to the measured intensity reflectivity change R(t) = |r(t)|2 (Extended 
Data Fig. 2a).
In Fig. 2c,d, we compare the decay of frequency oscillations  
with an asymptotic case, where the rise time becomes infinitely 
fast and the decay becomes infinitely slow (that is, when α→+∞ and 
β→0). We model this limiting case using two consecutive Heaviside  
functions (denoted as H(t)) (Extended Data Fig. 2b) using the follow-
ing expression:
r (t) = A × H (t −S
2 ) + B × H (t + S
2 ) + C.
Characterization of the temporal double slit
To characterize the double-slit time modulation, we use a short 
225-fs-FWHM probe in a degenerate pump–probe experiment. The 
probe is incident on the sample at a 60° angle to the normal, whereas 
the pump beams are incident at a 6° angle difference on either side of 
the probe. All the beams are p polarized to couple them to the Berreman 
resonance. The probe and one of the pumps go through a delay line to 
control the probe arrival time on the sample and the temporal separa-
tion between the two. The reflected probe signal is sent to a Princeton 
Instruments NIRvana camera for spectral characterization. For the 
double-slit experiment, the same illumination and detection apparatus 
is used, with the exception that the probe is temporally broadened 
before the sample by passing through an additional 4f system. We refer 
to our previous work12 for a complete characterization of the ITO/gold 
sample’s linear and nonlinear properties.
The double-slit aperture function (reflectivity R(t) = |r(t)|2, where 
r(t) is the complex Fresnel coefficient) can be measured by pump–
probe spectroscopy (Extended Data Fig. 1a, blue line), where the probe 
reflectivity is plotted as a function of delay for a fixed slit separation. 
The theoretical fit (Extended Data Fig. 1a, dashed red line) comes from 
the amplitude reflection coefficient r(t) defined earlier, convoluted 
with the envelope of the probe pulse in time Eprobe(t – τ) and pulse  
arriving at delay τ (approximated to a Gaussian profile with 225 fs 
FWHM), which is why spectrally integrated measurements cannot 
determine the reflectivity rise time.
In addition to fixing the values of normalization constants A, B  
and C, the fitting of the pump–probe reflectivity measurements allows 
us to assign a value for the β coefficient at 1/400 fs−1, corresponding to a 
decay time of intensity reflectivity (defined as the time to decrease from 
90 to 10%) of 625 fs (or 1/e of 330 fs, compatible with the literature14).
From this measurement, we can also set the relative amplitude of 
the second peak of the time slit to be 0.93% of the first one. As the rise 
time is limited by the probe pulse, we cannot estimate a precise value 
for it from this measurement, and instead, the spectral data (Fig. 2) 
are necessary.
Our model effectively reproduces the rise and decay time of modu-
lation but does not account for the short plateau at the maximum of 
modulation, which arises when pumping near or beyond the saturation 
of the mirror’s temporal response12. As time-varying effects exclusively 
depend on the slope of the modulation, we focus on reproducing this 
behaviour rather than the extent of the flat region at the maximum.
A wide range of separations can be achieved by varying the delay 
between the two pumps (Extended Data Fig. 1b, horizontal axis),  
whereas the delay of the probe is varied to map the modulation 
(Extended Data Fig. 1b, vertical axis).
An intensity dependence study of the modulation is illustrated in 
Extended Data Fig. 1c, showing that the double-slit experiments are 
performed where the modulation contrast of the time-varying mirror 
is saturated with pump power. The two pumps have a similar effect on 
the reflectivity change in the sample, although they illuminate it from 
different angles, namely, 54° and 66°, since the Berreman resonance 
is angularly wide8.
Time diffraction model
The probe spectra in the double-slit experiment are modelled as Fou-
rier transforms of the product of the double-slit reflection coefficient 
r(t) and probe field amplitude Eprobe(t) after the 4f system (product 
of a Gaussian envelope with 794 fs FWHM and carrier frequency of 
230.2 THz). The resulting spectrum I(f) is then squared to return the 
measured field intensity:
I ( f) = ℱ(r (t) × Eprobe (t −t0))
2 ,
where t0 is a parameter to account for a possible offset of the 
probe-pulse envelope peak and the temporal centre of the two slits. 
This model neglects the dispersion of the complex reflection coef-
ficient of the sample, as it assumes the same temporal response at all 
the frequencies. It also neglects the time evolution of the phase of r(t), 
which is, in principle, a complex function but is assumed to be real here.
Although this model effectively reproduces the period and ampli-
tude of the oscillations of the double-slit experiment, it fails to cap-
ture the asymmetry observed in the experimental spectrum, where 
more oscillations are visible on the red side (comparing Extended Data  
Fig. 3a,b). We attribute this to the time evolution of the phase of the 
complex reflection coefficient, which causes a Doppler shift of the

spectrum, often dubbed as time refraction6. A phenomenological model 
of the phase evolution cannot be built from our measurements, as the 
pump–probe data are only sensitive to the amplitude of reflectivity.
To better understand this asymmetry, we also model time diffrac-
tion using an adiabatic time-varying model that accounts for the phase 
evolution of the reflection coefficient as well as material dispersion 
(Extended Data Fig. 3c). Permittivity modulation is computed by cal-
culating a negative shift in the plasma frequency from the convolution 
of the Gaussian pump intensity with an exponential rise and decay 
response function13,14. This model of the pump-induced modulation 
in ENZ materials can reproduce the spectral oscillations, period and 
interferogram asymmetry (Extended Data Fig. 3a); however, it fails 
to capture the full spectral extent of the oscillations because of the 
fast rise time of the experimental slit aperture function, which is fun-
damentally limited by pump duration in our adiabatic simulations6,8. 
This discrepancy highlights the need for new models to describe such 
non-adiabatic modulation.
The diffraction model can be used to fit the experimental spectral 
data, giving a value for parameter α of 1/2 fs−1, corresponding to an 
intensity reflectivity rise time (10–90%) of 7 fs. As shown in Extended 
Data Fig. 3d, the data are close to the asymptotic limit of an infinitely 
fast rising slit; therefore, the fitting is equally good for a reflectivity 
rise time (10–90%) in the range of 1–10 fs.
