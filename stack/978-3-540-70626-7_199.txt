Historical Background
The soliton concept has in common with other mathematical concepts such as vec-
tors, tensors, matrices that it arises not only in mathematics but also in numerous
other ﬁelds, including physics, chemistry, biology as well as various branches of
engineering science (see, e.g., [1]). It is therefore not surprising that, depending on
the ﬁeld, the same name denotes different objects or properties and that a simple
deﬁnition comprising the entire current usage cannot be given.
The name soliton has its origin in hydraulics. In 1834, the Scottish engineer–
scientist John Scott Russell (1808–1882), while studying the movement of ships on
the Union Canal between Edinburgh and Glasgow, discovered what he described
as a ‘large, solitary, progressive wave’ [2]. This ‘heap of water’ originated when
a fast-moving ship was suddenly stopped. The swell, however, travelled along the
channel with essentially constant shape and with a velocity
V = [g(H + h0)]1/2
(1)
that depended only on the height H of the water level and the amplitude h0 of the
swell (g = 9.81 m s−2). Russell realised the difference between the ‘solitary wave
of translation’, as he also called the phenomenon, and the more common oscillatory
waves which do not involve transport of matter over long distances. He was con-
vinced of the fundamental nature of his discovery but could not give a convincing
theoretical explanation based on, say, Stokes’ equations of ﬂuid dynamics. After
many attempts by British and French scientists – either fruitless or only partially
successful – the French mathematician Joseph Valentin Boussinesq (1842–1929)
solved the problem in 1872 by demonstrating that a fourth-order partial differential
equation for the height h(x, t) of the water level in a shallow canal has the solution
h = h0 Sech2[(3h0/4H 3)1/2(x −V t)],
(2)
the speed V being given by (1) [3]. Equation (2) accounted very well indeed for
Russell’s numerous observations as well as later experimental work.

In 1895, apparently without being aware of the work of Boussinesq and other
French scientists, the Dutch mathematician Dieterik Johannes Korteweg (1848–
1941) and his Ph.D. student, Gustav de Vries, showed that the solitary wave
described by (1, 2) is a solution of a simpler evolution equation with ﬁrst-order
t- and second-order x-derivatives, now known as KdV equation [4]. It could have
easily been derived from the forth-order Boussinesq equation by assuming that the
shape of the wave was time-independent and by considering only waves travel-
ling in one direction in space (say, in the +x-direction). In numerical studies of
the KdV equation, Zabusky and Kruskal [5] noted that the ‘solitary wave’ (2) pos-
sesses certain persistence properties. When two such waves with different speeds
meet, they get temporarily modiﬁed but eventually emerge unchanged from the col-
lision. Clearly inspired by Russell’s nomenclature, Zabusky and Kruskal introduced
the expression ‘soliton’ in the title of their paper, which dealt not with ﬂuids but
with so-called collisionless plasmas. Subsequent analytical investigations showed
that the persistence is a consequence of a non-linear superposition theorem obeyed
by the solutions of the KdV equation. From the mathematical point of view, the
validity of such a theorem is an indispensable feature of a solitonic system.
It is a widespread but unjustiﬁed claim that the developments just described mark
the discovery of solitonic behaviour. (As one of many examples in the literature, see
Fokas and Zakharov [25]: “The fascinating new world of solitons and of integrable
behaviour was discovered by Kruskal and Zabusky”.) For a thorough and objec-
tive discussion of the subject the reader is referred to the thesis of M. Heyerhoff
[6], which also covers the nineteenth century work on Russell’s ‘solitary wave’ and
relevant work on differential geometry referred to below. The essential aspects of
solitonic behaviour were discovered in the period 1951–53 in a study not of the KdV
equation but of the Bour–Enneper equation [7]. (For the name and its alternative
Sine-Gordon equation see the next-but-one section.) These analytical investigations
preceded the corresponding work on the KdV equation by more than a decade. In
contrast to the Galilei-invariant KdV, the Bour–Enneper equation is Lorentz invari-
ant and therefore of particular interest for quantum ﬁeld theories. Hence, the present
essay concentrates on it.
Non-linear Wave Equations with Particle Solutions
In the summer of 1924, Prince Louis de Broglie (1892–1987, Nobel Prize for
physics 1929), working in Paris in the private laboratory of his elder brother Maurice
de Broglie, proposed that the motion of relativistic particles is guided by ‘phase
waves’ [8]. In their search for a wave equation that ﬁts de Broglie’s ideas, Klein
[26], Schr¨odinger [27], Fock [28], Gordon [29], and Kudar [30] proposed as a
Lorentz-invariant wave equation for particles of mass m the linear partial differ-
ential equation
ψ −∂2ψ/∂2(ct)2 = (2π/h)2m2c2ψ,
(3)

704
Solitons
where h = 6.626 × 10−34 Js denotes Planck’s constant and c the ‘limiting speed’
(in the present case the speed of light in vacuum). Depending on the context, (3) is
known as one-dimensional Helmholtz equation, Schr¨odinger–Gordon equation [9],
or Klein–Gordon equation  relativistic quantum mechanics. For various reasons
– one of them being the failure to account for the electron  spin and the effects
going with it – (3) and its extension to charged particles in an electromagnetic ﬁeld
[9] were soon found to be unsuitable for the description of  electrons. For the
one-electron problem it was successfully replaced by the  Dirac equation. Never-
theless, the Schr¨odinger–Gordon equation remained of interest for the description
of spin-zero bosons, in particular of the electrically charged pi-mesons, π+ and π−.
A natural question to ask is whether non-linear generalisations of (3) can be
found that yield ‘particle-like’ solutions. This is indeed the case. If on the right-hand
side of (3) the dependent variable ψ is replaced by (2πmc/h)f (ψ), where the non-
linear function f (ψ) satisﬁes certain conditions to be speciﬁed presently, restriction
of the spatial variation of ψ to the x-dimension followed by the substitution
z = (1 −V 2/c2)−1/2 (x −ct)
(4)
leads to
dψ2/dz2 = f (ψ)
(5)
with the solution

[F(ψ)]−1/2dψ = ±21/2z,
F(ψ) =

f (ψ)dψ.
(6)
Suppose now that f (ψ) is a differentiable function with simple zeros, with
df (ψ)/dψ > 0 at more than one zero, e.g. at . . . < ψ−1 < ψ0 < ψ1 < . . . .
The constant of integration in (62) may be chosen in such a way that F(ψ) has
double zeros at ψ0 and ψ1. With this choice, a solution ψ = ψ(z) obtained by
inverting (61) represents a kink or an antikink, depending on the choice of the sign
in (61), both with the kink height
ak := ψ1 −ψ0.
(7)
The name kink for this type of conﬁguration was introduced by Shockley [31] in
the context of dislocations in crystals but has since found more widespread usage.
As shown in Fig. 1, positive kinks are transitions from an (almost) constant solu-
tion ψ = ψ0 at large negative z to an (almost) constant solution ψ = ψ1 at large
positive z. More generally, in the language to be introduced below, kinks connect
adjacent ground states of systems with degenerate ground states.
Kinks resulting from non-linear generalisations of (3) may travel with constant
speed |V | either in the + x(V > 0) or in the −x(V < 0) direction as if they were
relativistic particles subject to the Lorentz contraction. From the ﬁeld-theory point
of view, they are excitations of the ground states of the system whose energy,
E = (1 −V 2/c2)−1/2 Ek,
(8)

Fig. 1 Shape of a +-kink connecting the dislocation segments lying in the valleys ψ = ψ0 and

is concentrated in a narrow spatial region, called kink width wk. If between ψ0 and
ψ1 the function F(ψ) has just one maximum, Fmax, a natural measure of the kink
width is
wk := [(1 −V 2/c2)/2Fmax]1/2 ak.
(9)
A general expression for the rest energy Ek of a kink will be given in (30).
It is trivial that the sum of two or more solutions of the equations obtained by
replacing the right-hand side of (3) with a non-linear function f (ψ) cannot be ex-
act solutions of these equations. It may be an approximate solution as long as the
individual solutions do not overlap, i.e. if neighbouring kinks are many kink widths
apart. Until about 1950 it was undisputed consensus among physicists that analo-
gous statements hold for all ﬁnite-amplitude excitations of non-linear systems. It
was believed that such excitations could not permanently co-exist and that their
coupling through the non-linearity necessarily results in gradual dissipation of their
kinetic energy (in the case of kinks to phonon-type excitations).
A Non-linear Wave Equation with Soliton Solutions
Towards the middle of 1950, the present writer noted that in the context of the dif-
ferential geometry of surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature, known as
pseudospherical surfaces [10, 11], the non-linear partial differential equation
∂2ω/∂ξ∂η = sin ω
(10)
had been extensively studied in the second half of the nineteenth century. (The name
comes from the fact that while the Gaussian curvature of spheres is K ≡+1, that

706
Solitons
of pseudo-spherical surfaces is K ≡−1. In the application to pseudo-spherical sur-
faces, the co-ordinate lines ξ = const. and η = const. are the asymptotic lines on
these surfaces, ω = ω(ξ, η) denoting the angle between these lines.) He realised that
quite a few of the nineteenth-century results might have far-reaching consequences
in physics, in particular in the theory of dislocations [12]. The transformation
x = ξ+, η, t = ξ −η
(11)
gives us
∂2ω/∂x2 −∂2ω/∂t2 = sin ω.
(12)
With ω = 2πψ/ak, the dimensionless generalisation (12) of the Klein–Gordon
equation satisﬁes the conditions for the existence of kink solutions. These are easily
found to read
ω = ±4 arctg{(1 −V 2)−1/2(x −V t)}.
(13)
The kink velocity V is measured in units of the limiting speed c, which need not
necessarily be identical with the speed of light.
The signiﬁcance of (10), (12) for pseudospherical surfaces was noted by the
German mathematician Alfred Enneper (1830–1885) in 1868/70 [32]. Already
in 1862, (10) had been encountered by the French mathematician Edmond Bour
(1832–1866) in another branch of the differential geometry of surfaces [33]. Hence,
the name Bour–Enneper equation for (10), (12) appears more appropriate than the
wide-spread denomination Sine-Gordon equation, particularly since the equation
has no relationship to W. Gordon and the name Sine-Gordon was originally intended
to be a private joke (see Heyerhoff [6], Chap. 4). In hindsight, from the point of
view of physics the key discovery was made by the Swedish mathematician Albert
Victor B¨acklund (1845–1922). In 1882 he demonstrated [13] that from a known so-
lution ω = ω0(ξ, η) of the second-order differential equation (10) further solutions
ω = ω1(ξ, η) may be obtained by integrating the following system of ﬁrst-order
differential equations:

The integrability condition of this system is
∂2ω0/∂ξ∂η = sin ω0,
(15)
i.e. the equation which, by assumption, is satisﬁed by ω0(ξ,η). By means of the
substitution
y = tg(ω1/4)
(16)

Solitons
707
S
the system (14) may be transformed into the following pair of Riccati equations:
∂y/∂ξ = (a y2 + b y + c), ∂y/∂η = (a′y2 + b′y + c′).
(17)
The explicit form of the coefﬁcients a, a′, etc. are given, e.g., in [14], together
with the corresponding expressions in the (x, t) co-ordinate system. Since these
expressions are substantially more complicated than (14), it is indeed advisable
to perform intermediate calculations in the light-cone co-ordinates (ξ, η) rather
than in the ‘physical’ co-ordinates (x, t). The rationale of this is that the lines
ξ = const., η = const. are the characteristics of (14).
The system (14) constitutes a so-called total differential equation. Its integrability
condition (15) is necessary and sufﬁcient for the general solution of the system (14)
to be of the form
σ(ω1; ξ, η) = C1,
(18)
where C1 is a constant of integration. Thus, the solutions ω = ω1 of (15) that may
be derived from a given ‘starting solution’ ω0, called B¨acklund transforms of ω0,
constitute a two-parameter family with parameters σ and C1. As is well known, by
means of the substitution y = Y ′/Y, where Y ′ denotes the partial derivatives of Y,
the Riccati-type system (17) may be transformed into a set of two linear equations
for Y(ξ, η). This indicates that the B¨acklund transforms of a given solution are su-
perposable, although not linearly but according to a law that is related to the addition
theorem of the tangent function. For a non-linear partial differential equation this is
a highly exceptional property.
The (non-linear) superposability of B¨acklund transforms is made explicit by the
relationship
tg[(ω3 −ω0)/4] = cos[(σ1 + σ2)/2]
sin[(σ1 −σ2)/2] tg[(ω1 −ω2)/4]
(19)
Here ω0 denotes the starting solution, ω1 and ω2 are its B¨acklund transforms with
parameters σ1 or σ2, respectively, and ω4 is the solution of (10), (12) resulting from
the ‘superposition’ of ω1 and ω2. We illustrate the power of the preceding approach
by two simple examples [7]. Further examples can be found in the literature [7, 14].
(1) Take ω0 ≡0 (mod 2π) as starting solution. Its B¨acklund transforms are
ωj = 4arctg {γj exp[(x −t sin σj)/ cos σj]} (j = 1, 2).

In (20), γj denotes constants of integration that replace the constants Cj (j = 1, 2)
on the right-hand side of (18).
The way in which the solution ω3 was constructed suggests that it represents two
kinks that move with speeds V1 and V2. In analogy to the Einstein–Minkowski de-
scription in relativity theory, we may ascribe to each of them a world line in the
x −t plane, i.e. a relationship between their locations xj(j = 1, 2) and time t. As
long as the two kinks are sufﬁciently far apart, their world lines are straight with
slopes V1 and V2. If V1 ̸= V2, at some time t the two kinks collide and interact
with each other. Figure 2 illustrates this for the collision at t ≈0 of a kink that was
originally at rest at the position x = −x1/2 with a second kink that approaches
the region of collision at x ≈0 with the speed V2 > 0. The ‘world region of in-
teraction’, in which it is difﬁcult or even impossible to discern the individual kinks,
is indicated as a circle in the x −t plane. The amazing feature of Fig. 2 is that, in
striking contrast to the pre-1950 expectations referred to in Sect. 2, there is no trans-
fer of kinetic energy to other excitation modes of the system, e.g. to non-harmonic
oscillations. Furthermore, the collision does not alter the distribution of the total en-
ergy and of the particle momentum among the kinks. After the collision there are
still two kinks with velocities V = 0 and V = V2. Since kinks on a given dislo-
cation line are indistinguishable (a feature they have in common with elementary
particles), we cannot distinguish between the view-point that “there has been no ex-
change of kinetic energy between the kinks” or the classical-mechanics description
“moving kink has come to rest after having transferred its entire kinetic energy to
its collision partner”. In any case, the statement “the kinks do not interact at all”
would be wrong. The world lines at large positive t are not the prolongation of the

lines at large negative t but have been shifted with respect to them by x1 and x2.
The original German name of xj was ‘Treffstrecke’ [7], translated into English as
recoil distance [13]. The concept is closely related to the concept of ‘time delay’ in
the theory of quantum scattering processes [34]. According to Donth (see [13] for
further details and illustrations) the recoil distances in kink–kink collisions are
|xj| = 1/2 cos σj ln | cos{1/2(σ1 + σ2)}/ sin{1/2(σ1 −σ2}| (j = 1, 2).
(23)
(2) Starting again from ω0 ≡0 (mod2π), we choose σ1, σ2 as complex conjugates
and write
σ1 = σ ′ + i σ ′′, σ2 = σ ′ −i σ ′′,
(24)
where σ ′and σ ′′ are real numbers. Without loss of generality, the choice γ1 = γ2 = 1
in (20) leads to
ω3 = 4arctg[H Sech(B1x + B2t) sin(D1x + D2t)].
(25)
The (real) parameters H, B1, B2, D1, and D2 are given in terms of σ ′ and σ ′′ in
[7, 13]. For a general choice of the parameters, (25) represents  wave packet with
phase velocity
Vph = −Cosh σ ′′/ sin σ ′
(26)
and group velocity
Vgr = −sin σ ′/Cosh σ ′′ = 1/Vph.
(27)
If we choose σ ′ = 0, the group velocity vanishes, and we get the so-called breather
mode

The breather mode of the Bour–Enneper equation is a localised oscillation with cir-
cular frequency Ω = Tghσ ′′ and amplitude 4arccos Ω. In the limiting case Ω ≪1,
it describes a kink–antikink pair with a total energy slightly less than that of two
separate kinks at rest (in the dimensionless units of the Bour–Enneper equation
equal to 16) and zero total momentum. Starting from rest, the two kinks attract
each other, move towards each other, and annihilate. At this stage the total energy
has been transformed into kinetic energy. From thereon the process is reversed. The
kinks are recreated and move away from each other until they reach the position of
maximal separation. This conﬁguration may be obtained from the starting conﬁg-
uration by interchanging the two members of the kink–antikink pair. Energetically,
the situation is the same as at the start, hence the cycle just described is repeated
with opposite sign of ω. The period of the entire oscillation cycle is thus 2π/Ω.

710
Solitons
In the limit σ ′′ →∞the above solutions reduce to the travelling-wave solutions
of the Klein–Gordon equation, from which Eigenschwingungen (‘normal-mode
vibrations’) can be formed. (Non-linear generalisations of standing small-amplitude
vibrations with soliton properties can also be obtained from the Bour–Enneper equa-
tion [35–37]. The breather solution is one example.) The familiar normal-mode
vibrations and the solitonic modes have in common that they can be superposed
indeﬁnitely without destroying their identity. In the original publication [7] this
property led to the denomination “Eigenbewegungen” (“normal motions”) for the
solitonic solutions of the Bour–Enneper equation, with a subdivision into “transla-
torische Eigenbewegungen” (σj real) and “oszillatorische Eigenbewegungen” (σj
pairwise complex conjugate). The corresponding English names translational soli-
tons and oscillatory solitons have not yet found general usage.
Appearance and Signiﬁcance of the Bour–Enneper
Equation in Physics
The ﬁrst branch of physics in which (12) appeared was crystal plasticity [38]. Up
to the present, the application to kinks in dislocations is of particular importance
[15,39]. It may be illustrated by a model whose ‘ground state’ is a ﬂexible string
lying in one of the ‘valleys’ of a horizontal corrugated iron sheet that is imagined to
be large enough for border effects to be negligible. The string represents a disloca-
tion with line tension γd and effective mass md per unit length, the corrugated iron
the so-called Peierls relief [39, 40], a periodic variation of the energy of a disloca-
tion as a function of its location in the crystal lattice. An external shear stress that
tends to push pre-existing dislocations through the Peierls relief may be modelled by
slightly tilting the sheet. The plastic deformation of a crystal caused by the applied
stress proceeds by moving segments of the dislocations into an adjacent valley, thus
creating kink–antikink pairs as shown in Fig. 2.
Owing to the periodicity of the Peierls relief, the model just described is a sys-
tem with degenerate ground states since at zero stress its energy is independent of
the valley in which the dislocation/string happens to be located. Kinked dislocations
may be considered as excited states that connect two distinct ground states. The ex-
citation energy (the kink formation energy Ek) consists of two contributions. (1) A
kink increases the potential energy of a dislocation because the segment connecting
the two valleys is lifted up the hill separating them. (2) The total dislocation length
is increased, hence work has to be done against the line tension.
Once a kink pair has been formed, the plastic deformation will proceed further,
since the applied stress will drive the kinks apart and cause them to slip along the
dislocation line. In this way, the shifting of a dislocation line from one Peierls valley
to an adjacent one is effected by overcoming an energy barrier that is much lower
than that required for shifting the entire dislocation line as a whole. This is analo-
gous to the overcoming of the shear strength of perfect crystals by the formation of
dislocations.

Fig. 3 World-line diagram representing the collision at time t ≈0 of a kink at rest at the position
x = −x1/2 with a kink of the same sign moving with high speed in the +x-direction. The circle
represents the ‘world region of interaction’, in which the identity of the kinks is partially lost. After
the collision both kinks re-appear unchanged, one of them having been displaced by x1 to the
position x = x1/2. The other kink resumes its former speed but along a world line that has been
shifted by x2
For a quantitative treatment of the present model, the simplest assumption is that
the energy of the string varies as UP = U0 sin2(πu/ak), where u is the displace-
ment of the string and ak the period of the ‘Peierls potential’ UP (cf. Fig. 2). With
the assumption |du/dx| ≪1 (realistic in metals, Fig. 2 being foreshortened), this
leads to
γd∂2u/∂x2 −md∂2u/∂t2 = dUP/du = (πU0/ak) sin(2πu/ak),
(29)
hence, with appropriate normalisation, to the Bour–Enneper equation (10), (12).
Among the soliton solutions of (29) are single kinks of height ak, sequences of
equidistant kinks, and standing or running waves of ﬁnite amplitude. Kink–antikink
pairs in unstable equilibrium, appearing in overcoming of the Peierls barriers
(Fig. 2), may be obtained by adding on the right-hand side of (29) a constant term
accounting for the applied stress [14].
In summary, the importance of (12), (15), (29) in physics is due to the following
features.
1. The equations admit kink and antikink solutions, a topological property that they
share with other non-linear equations as discussed in Sect. 2.
2. They possess solitonic solutions. Their characteristic is that they may be su-
perimposed notwithstanding the strong non-linearity on the right-hand side of
the equations and, thus, possess particle properties. The interactions of these
‘particle solutions’ mediated by the non-linearity are minimal in the sense that
from collisions the solutions emerge without having altered their ‘shape’ or their

712
Solitons
momentum. Since ‘particles’ of the same ‘charge’ are indistinguishable (see
Sect. 5), the only permanent effect of a collision is a parallel displacement of
their world lines.
3. The coincidence of properties (1) and (2) justiﬁes calling the solutions (13) topo-
logical solitons. The difference from the non-topological KdV solitons (2) has
far-reaching consequences when the mathematical results are to be applied to
‘real’ situations, since there will always be small violations of the assumptions on
which the Bour–Enneper or the Korteweg–deVries equations are based. Whereas
topological solitons remain kinks even if their kinetic energy is gradually trans-
ferred to oscillatory modes, Russell’s “heap of water” will gradually be dispersed
even if the conditions leading to the Boussinesq solution (2) are only mildly
violated.
4. Equations (12), (15), (29) are Lorentz-invariant and possess particle–antiparticle
solutions, in contrast to the Galilei-invariant KdV equation. Hence they may
serve as models of relativistic ﬁeld theories.
5. Owing to their particle-like properties, topological solitons are suitable objects
of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory [16–19]. Selected examples
will be given in the next section.
Energetics, Statistical Thermodynamics, and Quantum Theory
Within the framework of the model outlined above, the rest energy of a single kink,
Ek, may be calculated without having to evaluate the solution ψ(z). Since the con-
tributions (1) and (2) referred to in the preceding section turn out to be equal for any
choice of F(ψ) satisfying the requirements of Sect. 2, Ek can be expressed explicitly
in terms of F(ψ) as [39]
Ek = (2γd Fmax)1/2ak
υ=1

υ=0
[F(akυ)/Fmax]1/2dυ.
(30)
In the special case of (12), the dimensionless integral in (30) equals π−1.
Kink generation not only increases the energy of the system but also affects its
phonon frequencies and hence its entropy. These changes may be calculated by
considering small deviations ϕ(x, t) from an exact solution of the underlying partial
differential equation, e.g. the kink solution ωk(x, t) of (12). First-order perturbation
theory leads to the linear equation
∂2ϕ/∂x2 −∂2ϕ/∂t2 −cos ωk ϕ(x, t) = 0.
(31)
Transforming ωk(x, t) to the time-independent z-frame (4) permits the ansatz
ϕ(z, t) = ϕ(z) exp(± iΩt)
(32)

which gives us a time-independent Schr¨odinger equation for ϕ(z) and a dispersion
relation for the wave-like solutions of (31). Comparison with the dispersion relation
of the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation,
Ω = (k2 + 1)1/2,
(33)
where k is a dimensionless wave number, allows us to calculate the vibration fre-
quencies of a kinked string. From these the ‘entropy of formation’ of kinks, Sk, is
obtained by evaluating the partition function of a set of harmonic oscillators [14,20].
The dispersion relation (33) is identical with that of Yukawa’s meson theory [21].
Its quantisation leads to particles with ﬁnite rest mass, Yukawa’s U-particles, which
in nuclear physics are now identiﬁed with π-mesons. In the context of kinks in
dislocations the corresponding quanta are called ‘heavy phonons’ [20]. In a quan-
tum picture, the short-range interaction between kinks in the same dislocation may
thus be described as due to the exchange of the heavy phonons between colliding
kinks. As will be discussed in the next paragraph, their ‘light’ counterparts, acoustic
phonons with zero rest mass, are responsible for the long-range interaction between
kinks but have virtually no effect on Sk.
Since dislocation lines are embedded in 3-dimensional elastic media and sur-
rounded by long-range strain ﬁelds, modelling them as elastic strings may be
inadequate in some circumstances. The long-range interaction between kinks is an
important example. It arises from the deviation of a dislocation from a straight line
caused by a kink. The resulting modiﬁcation of the dislocation strain ﬁelds leads to a
pseudo-Coulomb interaction between kinks in the same dislocation line, resulting in
an interaction energy ±γ0ak2/2q between two kinks in the same, otherwise straight,
dislocation separated by the distance q[41]. (γ 0 is closely related to the line tension
γ d introduced in (29), the ratio γ d/γ 0being of the order of magnitude unity but never
less than one.) Thus, we may carry further the analogy between elementary particles
and kinks by considering the quantity (γ 0/2)1/2ak as a pseudo-charge of the kinks.
The massless acoustic phonons of the elastic medium then play the same role as the
photons ( light quantum) in the electrostatic interaction in elementary  particle
physics. The change-over from the pseudo-Coulomb interaction at large kink sepa-
rations to the Yukawa-type interaction at small separations has been experimentally
conﬁrmed in detail in experiments involving the formation of kink–antikink pairs
during the plastic deformation of metals [42].
In working out the equilibrium density of the kinks from the change of the free
energy of the system, we have to take into account that, owing to the translational in-
variance of (4), (5), equation (31) has always a zero-frequency mode. It corresponds
to the motion of kinks along the Peierls valley direction. This Goldstone mode con-
tributes to the free energy as a one-dimensional gas of non-interacting particles of
mass mk = Ek/c2, called soliton gas. Here the ‘limiting speed of the energy’ c is the
speed with which the heavy phonons of large wavelengths propagate along straight
dislocation lines lying in Peierls valleys.
In contrast to the phonon modes just discussed, periodic soliton solutions with
ﬁnite amplitudes such as the breather solution (28) cannot be quantised as harmonic

oscillators. The appropriate procedure is the quantisation in terms of action vari-
ables [22]. We illustrate this by considering the breather solutions at rest. They
form a one-parameter family,
ω = 4 arctg{tg(I/16) Sech[x sin(I/16)] sin[t cos(I/16)]},
(34)
with the relationship
Ω = cos(I/16)
(35)
between the breather frequency Ω and the parameter I. The breather energy is given
by [7, 14]
Ebreather = 2 Ek(1 −Ω2)1/2 = 2Ek sin(I/2Ek),
(36)
hence the breather frequency by
Ωbreather = ∂Ebreather/∂I.
(37)
Equation (37) is the classical relationship between frequency, energy, and action
variable [23] if we identify 2πI with the action variable of a closed orbit in clas-
sical mechanics. We may thus map the breather motion, which originated from a
ﬁeld-theory description, on the one-dimensional motion of a mass point [24]. This
allows us (1) to quantise breather modes by the Bohr–Sommerfeld–Einstein quan-
tisation rule, (2) to make use of the adiabatic invariance of the action variable of a
periodic system subject to a perturbation that varies at most slowly during the period
2π/Ω, and (3) to treat thermally activated rate processes involving breather-type mo-
tions by means of Kramers’ rate theory [17, 43]. On the other hand, the ﬁeld-theory
description permits the coupling between breather and phonon modes and thus the
radiation damping of driven breathers to be treated quantitatively [24].
The current difﬁculties in formulating a theory of elementary particles intended
to comprise not only the strong and the electroweak force but also gravitation are
widely attributed to the fact that the established theories treat the elementary par-
ticles as point-like. Among the motivations for the development of string theories
of elementary-particle physics  quantum gravity is the desire to replace the con-
ventional point particles by extended entities, the ‘strings’ or ‘brans’. Attempts to
avoid the concept of point-like elementary particles by considering non-linear ﬁeld
equations have a long history, going back at least as far as to the work of 1912 of
the German physicist Gustav Mie (1868–1957) and connected, in particular, with
the name of Albert Einstein (1879–1955). In the present context, the most interest-
ing work is that of the British physicist Tony Hilton Royle Skyrme (1922–1987),
summarised competently in a biography by Dalitz [19]. Skyrme came across (12)
in 1958 [44] when studying the Strong Interaction between nucleons. In computer
experiments with Perring [45, 46] published in 1962, i.e. well before the analo-
gous work of Zabusky and Kruskal [5] on the KdV equation, he rediscovered the
breather solution of the Bour–Enneper equation and the collision properties found
analytically already in the early 1950s [7]. It took a further decade until the signiﬁ-
cance of Skyrme’s ideas for elementary-particle physics was fully recognised.

Solitons
715
S
In the analogy between kinks and elementary particles, topological solitons do
play the role of ‘extended particles’. Their ‘world lines’ should therefore be replaced
by ‘world tubes’ with a diameter of the order of magnitude of the kink width wk [cf.
(9)]. Divergences that may appear in approximate expressions can be avoided by
recourse to more fundamental descriptions based on, say, atomic models of crystals.
Since the future of the string theories is still open, it is too early to speculate to what
extent the soliton properties of the Bour–Enneper equation might help in visualising
the outcome.

The development of scientiﬁc specialties is often related to scientiﬁc schools-from a
historical perspective as much as from an epistemological vantage point. Quantum
mechanics is not exceptional in this regard; its emergence was to a large extent
a product of the scientiﬁc schools of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, Max Born in
