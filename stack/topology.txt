In Defense of my Hubris
I call myself an aspiring mathematician because I’m painfully aware of how little
I know compared to, for example, research mathematicians. I’m also aware that
many introductions to topology have been written by people with much deeper
understandings of the subject than me.
But after looking at many of the introductions available, I still feel discontent
with what exists. Deﬁnitions feel unmotivated, point-set topology seems arbi-
trary. And at the same time, after spending spending many weeks mulling over
the most basic ideas of topology, they’ve coalesced into very clear and obvious
notions. I want to try and share that.
It occurs to me that perhaps I may have some comparative advantage in my
lack of mathematical maturity, because I’m much closer to the level of someone
ﬁrst learning topology than is someone who has researched in it for decades.
It occurs to me that perhaps I simply have a diﬀerent aesthetic, caring deeply
about motivation, and struggling with accepting deﬁnitions on my faith in the
author that I will one day ﬁnd the notion valuable. (Or perhaps the motivation is
more easily seen by others, and so doesn’t need to be taught. Or perhaps there’s
deep value in developing this intuition on ones own, and so it is strategically
not taught. Or perhaps intuition is personal and diﬃcult to convey.)
In the worst case, writing this is clarifying my own thoughts and understanding.
And having an open source topology textbook might be valuable, even if it isn’t
as good as others.

When Metrics Don’t Matter
When one thinks of distance, one thinks of distance between points on a plane.
One thinks of distance between points on a sphere, like our Earth. Between
points in space, and between points on a curve. But distance is so much more
general than that! There is distance between functions, between sets, and be-
tween strings of text!1
Distance on the plane is part of our everyday life. When we walk around a
room, move a pencil between points on a sheet of paper, or move a mouse
on a computer, we are working with distance. Most of us have been drilled
on questions relating to this from our earliest education – the Pythagorean
theorem is really about distance on a plane. If I move by ∆x horizontally and
∆y vertically, the distance that I moved from my starting point is the length of
the diagonal line to my new position, which being the hypotenuse of the triangle
we’ve made, is
p
∆x2 + ∆y2. (Note that this wouldn’t be true for triangles on
a sphere.)
But things are diﬀerent in diﬀerent situations in life. A taxi driver in New York
navigates a grid of roads and can’t move diagonally. To the driver, the diagonal-
movement-allowing notion of distance is very misleading: ‘closer’ objects may
be a longer drive away than ‘farther’ objects. To the driver, distance between
points is how far one needs to drive, the sum of the x and y distance, |∆x|+|∆y|.
As you can see, distance is a matter of context. There are often multiple equally
valid notions of distance on the same space. We call these diﬀerent notions of dis-
tance metrics. The diagonal-movement-allowing metric is called the Euclidean

see L1, L2 and super norm based metrics. For sets, see Hausdorﬀdistance. For strings, see
the various versions of edit distance.

metric. The non-diagonal-movement-allowing metric is called the Manhattan
metric.
Once one has a metric, all sorts of questions become possible to ask. In addition
to the obvious questions (is point a or point b further from c?), it becomes
possible to formally deﬁne many ideas that we intuitively have:
• What is the boundary of a set?
• Are two sets connected?
• Is a function continuous?
• Does a sequence converge?
• Does a set have holes in it?
Remarkably, diﬀerent though the Euclidean and the Manhattan metric are, they
give the exact same answer to all these questions!
This observation hints that, for a certain class of broad and important questions,
much of the information encoded in a notion of distance is superﬂuous and that
some core similarity runs between all these diﬀerent metrics. And, for me at
least, such observations begin the thrill of the mathematical hunt.
Can we
precisely deﬁne this commonality between diﬀerent metrics? Can we abstract
away this core similarity and detach from notions of distance? If we succeed in
abstracting this notion away, will it allow us to bring these notions to spaces
that we can’t put a useful metric on? The answer to all of these is yes!
If you think about it for a moment, you may begin to suspect that all this is
entangled with what it means to be very very close under a certain metric. The
Euclidean and Manhattan metric may disagree with speciﬁc issues, but they
agree that the sequence of points
(0.1, 0.1), (0.01, 0.01), (0.001, 0.001) ...
gets arbitrarily close to (0, 0). Since a lot of the issues we’ve talked about, like
continuity, boundary, and connectedness involve inﬁntessimal behavior, “arbi-
trary closeness” seems like rather promising avenue.
On this intuition, we will pursue this idea of being arbitrarily or inﬁnitely close.
As it turns out, this is the ﬁeld of topology. From this initial mission statement,
it may seem like a very sparse or dry topic, but as we shall see it is actually
exceedingly rich. In some ways, one might thing of topology as giving us a
sort of “qualitative geometry” where we escape concerns like speciﬁc length and
angles. The ideas are also remarkable for their extreme generality
You may have previously heard things like: “A topologist is someone who can’t
tell the diﬀerence between a coﬀee cup and a donut, because you can stretch
and squish one into another.” There’s some truth to this. If you can imagine
4

deforming one clay object into another, then they are topologically equivalent.
This is because, while the distances between points may change, the local “ar-
bitrary closeness” is unaﬀected and so when you forget about distance and only
remember this arbitrary closeness, they are the same object. That said, topo-
logical equivalence doesn’t actually require these imaginary deformations. And
in fact, this image of topology really sells short the ﬁeld.
At this point, you are hopefully persuaded that this “arbitrary closeness” is
a worthwhile topic of investigation, even if you are somewhat skeptical of the
claimed richness. As such, it is an appropriate time for us to nail down some
more precise deﬁnitions. The correct deﬁnition is a complicated issue, often
without a right or wrong answer,2 and we will evolve more sophisticated deﬁni-
tions of a topological space as we progress, but for now we shall base our inquiry
on the notion of adherant points.
A point is called an adherant point of a set if it is in or inﬁnitely close to that
set. That is, p is an adherant point of S if one can ﬁnd q ∈S that is arbitrarily
close to p. The closure of a set S, cl(S), is all the adherant points of S. You
can think of it as S, plus any parts of its boundary that it was missing.
A topological space (X, cl), then, is a space X equipped with a closure operator
cl.
1.2
The Abstract Axiomatic Approach
One of the most famous mathematicians of all time is Euclid. He wrote a book,
Euclid’s Elements, proving a large number of geometric results. Most of the
results of Euclid’s Elements were proved before him by others, so why is it such
a revered book? The true remarkableness of it lies not in the proved results,
but in the way it begins with a few trivial geometric facts (eg. “a line can be
drawn between any two points”) that everyone can easily agree to be true, and
builds up all the results as a logical progression from there.3
This approach of building results up from simple premises that are taken to be
true, called axioms. A consequence of this axiomatic approach is that it makes
truth very objective, in some sense. Once you and I agree on the axioms, we
can agree on whether or not a given result is true. Further, even if you don’t
agree with me on the axioms, we should be able to agree on whether results are
true were the axioms true.
This axiomatic approach shouldn’t be seen as constraining. It doesn’t mean that
every proof needs to be stated in terms of axioms, since we can use anything
we’ve previously proven. And often informal discussion and intuition will not

3This section is inspired by the section ‘Axioms and Men’ from Pinter’s A Book of Abstract
Algebra
5

involve axioms at all. And it leaves you free to consider any system of axioms
you want, and imagine what that world would be like!
But not only is it not constraining, building from axioms can be empowering. A
great deal can be revealed about a topic by boiling it down to its core premises,
on which everything is based. One sees how many of ideas really encode the
same information.
One can look at what changes as axioms are added and
removed. It’s really quite remarkable how a few simple sentences can contain a
vast topic!
It’s worth noting that, very frequently, axioms don’t just ﬂoat free, but are
baked into the deﬁnition of something. If you deﬁne something to be an object
with certain properties, those are ‘axioms’ when you are talking about that
type of object. In these cases, axioms become less a matter of truth and more
a question of taste or usefulness.4
Alone, all this makes the axiomatic approach very compelling... But it actually
develops into something much deeper. One recurring theme in mathematics is
that we see the same patterns and ideas in very diﬀerent places.
For example, you are familiar with the distributivity of multiplication: a ∗
(b + c) = a ∗b + a ∗c. This is true not only about numbers, but also about
matrices. It is also the case that for three sets, intersection distributes over
union, a ∩(b ∪c) = a ∩b ∪a ∩c, and that for three boolean values, and
distributes over or, a ∧(b ∨c) = a ∧b ∨a ∧c.
Another example is all the diﬀerent mathematical objects we can talk about
distance between.
These recurring patterns and ideas motivate mathematicians to abstract the
common parts into a new idea. Not only are these generic ideas often beautiful
and reveal very deep properties of objects... They also make our lives a lot
easier, because we don’t have to write the same proof out hundreds of times,
for all the diﬀerent objects we might want to work with that have the same
properties!
(Readers with a background in programming or computer science may like to
think of this as making mathematical proofs polymorphic, proving things not
for a singular type of object, but for any type that extends a class, implements
an interface, or the analogous idea in one’s preferred programming language.5)
These “abstract structures” are a staple of mathematics.
Some taste of the
variety that exists is valuable. There are spaces, sets equipped with some extra
structure to give additional information about the space:
4Again, I refer the reader to Proofs and Refutations, a play about mathematical philosophy
where characters explore possible deﬁnitions of a polyhedron, and the process of coming up
with those deﬁnitions.
5This analogy between proofs and programs is actually very deep. See the Curry-Howard
Correspondence, which links proofs of theorems to programs generating objects of a particular
type.

• Metric Spaces: a metric, d, function gives distances between elements
• Measure Spaces: a measure function, µ, gives the measure – a generaliza-
tion of length/area/volume/... – of subsets
• Probability Spaces: measure spaces with a total measure of one
• Topological Spaces: the topic of this book
There are also algebraic structures. These arose as mathematicians began to
study algebraic questions involving things other than numbers, such as matrices
and boolean values. During this explosion of algebras, it was observed that many
of these diﬀerent types of objects shared similar algebraic properties. These
common properties were abstracted into algebraic structures. Perhaps the most
notable such structures are sets along with binary operations that combine two
elements into one in manners paralleling common arithmetic operations (like
addition and multiplication):
• Monoids: an operation analogous to addition or multiplication
• Groups: operations analogous to addition and subtraction (or multiplica-
tion and division)
• Rings: operations analogous to addition, subtraction, and multiplication
• Fields: operations analogous to addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division
• Vector Spaces: an ‘addition’ operation and a ‘scaling’ operation
Vector spaces often have additional structure:
• Normed Vector Spaces: vectors have a notion of length
• Inner Product Spaces: a “multiply parallel components” operation gives
elements lengths and angles between elements
These are only the most basic and foundation abstract structures in mathe-
matics: hundreds more exist. Each one mentioned here is extremely deep and
worthy of books of discussion – any attempt to truley introduce them here would
be a tragic butchering of the topic. They’re mentioned to give you some taste
for the variety of structures that exist.

Exercises
1. Pick an abstract structure you are unfamiliar with that was mentioned
in this section. Imagine some reasonableness rules it might be subject
to. Brainstorm a list of nice properties for it to have. Then look up its
deﬁnition and see if you were right! Try to understand the motivation
where the deﬁnition diﬀers from yours.
Is there another structure that is equivalent to what you came up with?
You may want to look at Wikipedia’s Outline of Algebraic Structures. If,
ultimately, you can’t ﬁnd your structure, you may have stumbled upon
something new to explore!
(Repeat this exercise as desired, until you run out of unknown structures!)
2. Pick an abstract structure you are familiar with. Try to deﬁne it in the
most radically diﬀerent way possible. Extra points for more alternative
deﬁnitions. Extra points for inventing new words in the process.
(Repeat this exercise as desired, until you run out of known structures!)
1.3
Axiomatization of Topological Spaces
What sort of restrictions should be placed on a valid topological space?
Let’s start by trying to ask concrete questions. For any space, there are two
sets that are necessarily available for us to talk about: the empty set, ∅, and
the full space, X. What should the closure of these be?
To say that cl(∅) is anything other than the empty set doesn’t really seem
reasonable. It is equivalent to saying that some points in our space are on the
boundary of nothing. Therefore,
cl(∅) = ∅
(Closure 1)
To say that cl(X) is anything other than X doesn’t really seem reasonable
either. The only other possibility would be for the closure to be a subset of X,
which would be to say that points in X aren’t inﬁnitely close to it, that adding
the boundary removes point from the set. That would be pretty silly. And it
brings us to a more general principle: the closure of S should always include S,
S ⊆cl(S)
(Closure 2)
Another natural question to ask, when given a function that takes objects of
one type to the same type, is what happens if we apply it repeatedly. What
happens if we iterate? What kind of function is cl ◦cl ◦cl ◦...? Well, suppose
x ∈cl(cl(S)). Then x is ‘inﬁnitely close’ to points in cl(S), which are ‘inﬁnitely
close’ to points in S. It seems reasonable to think that the property of being
8

‘inﬁnitely close’ should be associative, and that x should then be inﬁnitely close
to points in S. So, x ∈cl(cl(S)) implies that x ∈cl(S). Combined with the fact
that S ⊆cl(S), it must be the case that
cl(cl(S)) = cl(S)
(Closure 3)
. That is, adding the boundary of a set to a set doesn’t create a larger boundary.
And in answer to our previous question, cl ◦cl ◦cl ◦... = cl.
Yet another natural question to ask is how closure interacts with our standard
set operations. We will explore its relationship to complement shortly, but for
now leave ourselves to consider only union and intersection.
Clearly, the closure of the union of A and B should contain the closure of A
and the closure of B – that is cl(A) ∪cl(B) ⊆cl(A ∪B). But should the closure
contain additional points? Can a point be ‘inﬁnitely close’ to the union of A
and B without being ‘inﬁnitely close’ to A or B? Surely it can only be as close
to the union as it is to the closer of the two, and no closer than that? Again,
for it to be another way doesn’t seem very reasonable. So,
cl(A) ∪cl(B) = cl(A ∪B)
(Closure 4)
What about intersection? A quick example will persuade you that there is little
to be said here. The issue is that the two sets could be getting close to the
set in very diﬀerent ways. For example, consider the real numbers under and
our usual notion of closure. The real numbers greater than zero, R>0, and real
numbers less than zero, R<0, both get inﬁnitely close to 0, but they do so from
opposite sides and so the intersection is empty and the closure of that is empty.
Therefore, cl(A) ∩cl(B) ̸= cl(A ∩B).
Another natural property to desire is that A ⊆B should imply cl(A) ⊆cl(B).
This, in fact, follows from our axioms: We can factor B into B = A ∪(B \ A)
and since cl(A ∪(B \ A)) = cl(A) ∪cl(B \ A), it follows that cl(B) must contain
cl(A). This gives us our ﬁrst lemma: 6
A ⊆B =⇒cl(A) ⊆cl(B)
(Lemma 1)
These four properties we have come up with are called the Kuratowski closure
axioms or just the closure axioms. They are (equivalent to) the deﬁnition of a
topological space.
Now, you may feel there is a certain arbitrariness to selecting these axioms for
our deﬁnition. Sure, they seem like reasonable axioms, but why them and not
others? And you’re absolutely correct. They are kind of arbitrary.
The thing is, mathematician’s also talk about weaker versions of topological
spaces (with few axioms) and stronger ones (with additional axioms). For ex-
ample, a pre-topological space is a topological space without the requirement

closure is a monad.

that cl(cl(S)) = cl(S). On the other hand a T1 topological space is one which
has the additional requirement that cl({x}) = {x}, that no other points are
‘inﬁnitely close’ to an individual point. One is free to study any of these that
they like. It just that topological spaces seem to be a healthy compromise to
start at.
1.4
Every Set Can Be A Topological Space!
At this point, the only topological spaces you know of, really, are metric spaces
you were already familiar with. In this section, we shall describe some topologies
you can put on any space without making reference to metrics.
In a space X with the indiscrete topology, the closure operator is
cl(S) =
(
∅
S = ∅
X
S ̸= ∅
Intuitively, this means that every point is inﬁnitely close to every other point.
Notice that we haven’t needed to talk about metrics to describe this and, in
fact, can not as no metric corresponds to this topology, since metrics require
there to be non-zero distance between unequal elements.7
Now, we should
rigorously verify that this indiscrete topology by checking that the proposed
closure function obeys the closure axioms:
Proof: We consider each of the four closure axioms independently.
1. By deﬁnition, cl(∅) = ∅.
2. If S = ∅then ∅⊆∅and if S ̸= ∅then S ⊆X, so S ⊆cl(S).
3. If S = ∅then cl(cl(∅)) = cl(∅) and if S ̸= ∅then cl(cl(S)) = cl(X) = X =
cl(S), so cl(cl(S)) = cl(S).
4. If either A or B are ∅, we may assume without loss of generality that A
is ∅. Then cl(A ∪B) = cl(∅∪B) = cl(B) = ∅∪cl(B) = cl(A) ∪cl(B).
On the other hand, if neither A or B is ∅, then cl(A ∪B) = X = X ∪X =
cl(A) ∪cl(B). So, cl(A ∪B) = cl(A) ∪cl(B).
The opposite of the indiscrete topology is the discrete topology. Where in the
indiscrete topology, everything is intuitively close together and sticks to ev-
erything else, in the discrete topology everything is spaced apart and touches
nothing else. The closure operator for a discrete topology is the identity opera-
tion, cl(S) = S, since there is never anything additional near by.
7A metric without this pesky requirement that non-zero distance between unequal elements
is called a pseudometric. The pseudometric d(x, y) = 0 gives the indiscrete topology.
10

Another interesting topology is the ﬁnite-closed topology. It’s sort of in between
the discrete and indiscrete topologies. In it, nothing sticks to individual points,
but all points are close to any inﬁnite set. The closure operator is
cl(S) =
(
S
|S| ∈N
X
S ̸∈N
Exercises
1. Prove that the discrete topology’s closure operation obeys the closure
axioms.
2. Prove that the ﬁnite-closed topology’s closure operation obeys the closure
axioms.
1.5
Topological Operations: Interior, Boundary...
Up to this point, we’ve only talked about closure. You may be getting tired of
it. Never fear, we’re about to greatly expand the topological operations we have
available.
To begin with, let us deﬁne the boundary of a set as the points that adhere to
both the set and its complement.
bd(S) = cl(S) ∩cl(SC)
We will also deﬁne the interior operator, which will be the opposite of our clo-
sure operator. Instead of adding the boundary to a set, it removes the boundary
from a set. We can ﬁnd the interior of a set by considering the closure of its
complement. By adding the boundary to the complement of the set, when we
complement again we get our set without the boundary.
int(S) = cl(SC)C
Finally, the limit points of a set are the parts of the closure that are not in the
original set.
lim(S) = cl(S) \ S
Topological Anatomy, A Visual Approach
To build some intuition, let’s consider an example: the space is a rectangle, with
our set as the bottom half, its complement as the top. They both contain part
of the small stripe boundary.
11

A
AC
Let’s now consider what happens to the set when we apply a number of opera-
tions.
A
AC
cl(A)
int(AC)
int(A)
cl(AC)
A
int(AC)
lim(A)
int(A)
int(AC)
bd(A) = bd(AC)
Now, this paints a bit of a falsely simplistic picture... ((Give example where
things are less simple.))
Topological Operation Identities
These pictures should have given you a lot of intuition for how these operations
should interact.
There are a lot of nice properties.
We will call them the
topological operation identities.
As you look at these, look back at the pictures and see how these identities can
be observed in them.
Closure – Interior
cl(S)C = int(SC)
cl(SC) = int(S)C
12

Closure – Boundary
cl(S) = S ∪bd(S)
Closure – Limit
cl(S) = S ∪lim(S)
Interior – Boundary
int(S) = S \ bd(S)
bd(S) = (int(S) ∪int(SC))C
Interior – Limit
int(S) = S \ lim(SC)
Boundary – Limit
bd(S) = lim(S) ∪lim(SC)
Proof (Closure – Interior): The deﬁnition of interior gives us cl(SC)C =
int(S). By substituting S = SC we get cl(S)C = int(SC). On the other hand,
by complementing both sides, we get cl(SC) = int(S)C.
The proof of the rest of the identities are left as an exercise to the reader.
Exercises
1. Prove the remaining topological operation identities.
2. How many diﬀerent sets can you make using closure and complement?
3. A topological space can be deﬁned in terms of an interior operator as well
as closure. What are the axioms for an interior-based deﬁnition? (eg.
int(int(S)) = int(S) )
4. A topological space can also be deﬁned in terms of a boundary operator
as well as closure. What are the axioms for a boundary-based deﬁnition?
(Hint: one of the axioms becomes unnecessary.)
1.6
Topological Fixed-Points: Open and Closed
An open set is one which is its own interior (int(S) = S). This means that it
does not contain its boundary. Conversely, a closed set is one which is its own
closure (cl(S) = S). Closed sets completely contain their boundary.8
A clopen set is a set that is both open and closed. How can this be? How can a
set both contain and not contain its boundary? The answer is that clopen sets
don’t have a boundary. For example, the empty set ∅and the full space X are
both clopen sets, since they have no boundary. The existence of other clopen
8The more general notion here is ﬁxed-points. Closed sets are the ﬁxed-points of closure
and open sets are the ﬁxed-points of interior. Fixed-points can be a very interesting topic.
13

sets is tightly tied to notions of connectedness, since if some portion of a space
does not have a boundary, it is not connected to the rest of the space.
It is important to note that not all sets are open or closed (or both). Many
contain part of their boundary but not another part.
A natural question to ask is how closed and open sets interact with our basic
set operations.
First we consider complement. If a set is closed, it’s complement is open and
vice versa.
The idea is that if a set contains its boundary, it’s complement
doesn’t contain the boundary.
Proof: If S is closed, then by deﬁnition cl(S) = S. So int(SC) = cl((SC)C)C =
cl(S)C = SC, which means SC is open.
Next, we consider union. The union of two closed sets is closed.
Proof: If A and B are closed, cl(A) = A and cl(B) = B. Recall that one of our
closure axioms is that cl(A ∪B) = cl(A) ∪cl(B). Then, cl(A ∪B) = A ∪B and
A ∪B is closed.
Finally we consider intersection. The intersection of any number of closed sets
is closed. The idea is that if a point is close to the intersection of the sets, it
was close to all the sets, and since they were closed it was also an element of all
those sets, and so in the intersection as well.
Proof: If {Sn} is a collection of closed sets, then cl(Sn) = Sn for all n. Let
S be the intersection of this collection, S = T
n Sn. Since S ⊆Sn for all n,
by an earlier lemma, cl(S) ⊆cl(Sn) and since cl(Sn) = Sn, it is the case that
cl(S) ⊆Sn. It follows that cl(S) ⊆T
n cl(Sn) = S and S = cl(S). Therefore, S
is closed.
You’ve probably noticed that we proved that the union of two closed sets is
closed but that we proved that the intersection of an arbitrary number of closed
sets is closed? What’s the diﬀerence? Doesn’t an arbitrary number follow from
our two result by mathematical induction?
Well, an arbitrary ﬁnite number does.
For example, since the union of two
closed sets is closed, the union of ten closed sets is also closed: union the ﬁrst
two, then than with the next one, and so on. But a union of an inﬁnite number
of closed sets is not necessarily closed. A simple example is that, in the real
numbers, any set consisting of a single point is closed but it does not follow
that every subset of the real numbers, being a union of singleton sets for every
element, are all closed.
In conclusion:
• The complement of a closed set is an open set.
• The union of two closed sets is a closed set.
14

• The intersection of an arbitrary number of a closed sets is a closed set.
What about open sets? Because they are the complements of closed sets, each
one of these results has a kind of ‘dual’ result. Note how union and intersection
switch. This is because of De Morgan’s law: (a ∪b)C = aC ∩bC and (a ∩b)c =
aC ∪bC.
• The complement of an open set is a closed set.
• The intersection of two open sets is an open set.
• The union of an arbitrary number of open sets is an open set.
Proving these is left as an exercise to the reader.

3. Prove the open set properties by application of De Morgan’s law.
4. Prove the open set properties from scratch, using the interior axioms you
developed previously.
5. We’ve considered sets which are their own interior (open sets) and sets
which are their own closure (closed sets), but what about sets that are
their own boundary (boundary sets)?
(a) Are they open, closed, clopen, or neither (and how does this vary
between examples)?
(b) How do they interact with our basic set operations: complement,
union, and intersection?

1.7
What Does Closure Look Like?
What does it really mean to be a valid closure operator? We have a bunch of
rules, but what do they mean?
One thing that we can do to really help us understand is look visualize what all
the rules mean.
We will represent A ⊂B by a blue line between A and B, with A bellow B. We
will represent cl(A) = B with a red arrow from A to B.
For example, recall that the discrete closure operator is the one where no points
are close together, and so closure doesn’t change anything. We visualize it on
the space {1, 2} as:
{}
{1}
{2}
{1, 2}
{}
{1}
{2}
{1, 2}
On the other hand, in the indiscrete closure, where all points are close together
and so every non-empty set gets mapped to the full space, looks like:
{}
{1}
{2}
{1, 2}
{}
{1}
{2}
{1, 2}
As we will see, all the closure axioms have visual interpretations. As you read,
verify that the two previous examples obey the closure axioms.

Closure 1: cl(∅) = ∅
The empty set is mapped by closure to itself.
∅
...
...
∅
...
...
Closure 2: S ⊆cl(S)
Arrows either go horizontally (to itself) or upwards (to one of its super sets),
but never downwards.
A
B
A
B
Closure 3: cl(cl(S)) = cl(S)
If an arrow maps to some value, that value must map to itself. For example, if
the closure of A is B, then B must be its own closure.
A
B
A
B
A
B
Closure 4: cl(A) ∪cl(B) = cl(A ∪B)
The union of two sets maps to the union of their closures. For example, if C is
the closure of A and D is the closure of B, then C ∪D must be the closure of
A ∪B.

Insights from Visualization
One very important insight to draw is just how far from being an arbitrary
mapping from subsets of your space (P(X)) to subsets of your space the closure
operation is. Only a tiny fraction of such functions obey the closure axiom.
For a set of cardinality (size) n, the number of possible maps from its subsets
to its subsets is (2n)(2n). In the next chapter, we will see that the number of
valid closure operators is much less than 2(2n). That’s a pretty big diﬀerence!
This conﬂict between the number of possible mappings and the number of valid
closure operators is a ﬁrst hint that perhaps the closure operator isn’t the best
way to represent topological information about a set.
Exercises
1. Draw the discrete closure operator on {1, 2, 3}. Verify that it obeys the
closure axioms visually.
2. Draw the inidiscrete closure operator on {1, 2, 3}. Verify that it obeys the
closure axioms visually.
3. Draw a closure operator on {1, 2, 3} that isn’t the discrete or indiscrete
closure operator.
4. Draw the ﬁnite-closed closure operator on Z.
Verify that it obeys the
closure axioms visually. (Obviously, since Z is inﬁnite, you can’t draw the
entire thing. Draw a represantitive part and imagine what the entire thing
would be like...)
5. On the closure operator drawings you’ve made, circle or highlight the
closed sets. What do you notice?
6. Prove that closed sets uniquely deﬁne the closure operation.
7. Visually prove the basic set interactions with closed sets. (Prove that the
union of two closed sets is closed, that the intersection of an arbitrary
number of closed sets is closed.)
18

8. The interior operator can be visualized in the same way. Redraw the previ-
ous examples with arrows representing interior (preferably, use a diﬀerent
color). Compare the closure diagrams and the interior diagrams. What
do you notice?
9. On the interior operator drawings you’ve made, circle or highlight the
open sets. What do you notice?
10. Prove that the open sets uniquely deﬁne the interior operator.

Arbitrarily Close: Your Local Neighborhood
Filter
((Explain how open sets can be a drop in for “within ϵ distance” and the neigh-
borhood ﬁlter can replace “for all ϵ > 0 distance...”.))
2.2
Topology in Terms of Open Sets
((Redeﬁne closure using neighborhood ﬁlters. Prove that the open set properties
we derived in the last chapter imply the closure axioms.
Therefore, we can
describe a topological space in terms of open sets.))
((Reasons why it might be better: More random structures form topologies;
Easier to describe topologies; Useful in proofs; Open sets are a very powerful
language for us to state more complicated ideas in. Remind readers that there
can be lots of valid deﬁnitions.))

axioms .))

Chapter 3
Finding the Big Picture
((Local point set topology isn’t very glamorous. To prevent reader fatigue, we
want to give some tools to zoom out and see the big picture of a topological
space (AKA, give them something closer the popular notion of topology). So,
we introduce some combinatorial or algebraic topology.
Probably homotopy
groups.))
