Photosystems II and I (PSII, PSI) are the reaction centre-containing complexes driving 
the light reactions of photosynthesis; PSII performs light-driven water oxidation and 
PSI further photo-energizes harvested electrons. The impressive efficiencies of the 
photosystems have motivated extensive biological, artificial and biohybrid approaches 
to ‘re-wire’ photosynthesis for higher biomass-conversion efficiencies and new 
reaction pathways, such as H2 evolution or CO2 fixation1,2. Previous approaches 
focused on charge extraction at terminal electron acceptors of the photosystems3. 
Electron extraction at earlier steps, perhaps immediately from photoexcited reaction 
centres, would enable greater thermodynamic gains; however, this was believed 
impossible with reaction centres buried at least 4 nm within the photosystems4,5. 
Here, we demonstrate, using in vivo ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, 
extraction of electrons directly from photoexcited PSI and PSII at early points 
(several picoseconds post-photo-excitation) with live cyanobacterial cells or isolated 
photosystems, and exogenous electron mediators such as 2,6-dichloro-1,4- 
benzoquinone (DCBQ) and methyl viologen. We postulate that these mediators 
oxidize peripheral chlorophyll pigments participating in highly delocalized charge- 
transfer states after initial photo-excitation. Our results challenge previous models 
that the photoexcited reaction centres are insulated within the photosystem protein 
scaffold, opening new avenues to study and re-wire photosynthesis for biotechnologies 
and semi-artificial photosynthesis.
The photodynamics of Photosystems I and II have been extensively stud-
ied in vitro using ultrafast TA spectroscopy6. In this technique, the sam-
ple’s absorbance spectrum is measured by a broadband probe laser after 
photo-excitation by a pump laser (that is, pump-probe spectroscopy), 
with access to photodynamics occurring on the subpico-second time-
scale. Previously, it has been challenging to apply ultrafast TA spectros-
copy on the photosystems in vivo, with plant or algal cells (typically 10 µm 
in size)7 being highly scattering. Recently, ultrafast TA spectroscopy was 
successfully applied to Nannochloropsis sp. algal cells (2–5 µm in size)8, 
whose small size lessened these scattering effects9. Here, we studied 
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) cyanobacterial 
cells (Fig. 1a–c), which is a model organism for studying photosynthesis 
because of the endosymbiotic origin of the chloroplast in eukaryotic 
plants and algae10. The smaller size of Synechocystis cells (less than 
2 µm)11 further reduced the scattering, and the photodynamics of the 
photosystems in vivo could be resolved using ultrafast TA spectroscopy.
Photo-excitation of Synechocystis cells with a 200 fs pump pulse 
centred at 450 nm revealed rich initial transient spectral features in 
the visible (550–800 nm). We identified a prominent negative feature 
at 685 nm (Fig. 1d), which decayed within roughly 20 ps to 10% of its 
initial value. We attribute this feature to the ground-state bleaching 
of the photoactive reaction centres of PSI and PSII. A lower-energy 
feature at 715 nm grew within roughly 2 ps after photo-excitation and 
subsequently decayed on a longer pico-second timescale, indicat-
ing rapid excited state relaxation processes. Similarly, we observed 
higher-energy positive transient features (less than 680 nm), which 
we assign to contributions from the photo-induced absorption of 
phycobilisomes (PBSs) and carotenoids, as these features resemble 
those of in vitro steady state absorption measurements12,13 and are 
absent from isolated photosystems (Supplementary Fig. 7). We verified  
that the photosystems remained intact without photodamage, consist-
ent over several biological replicates, and were in a closed state through-
out these measurements (Supplementary Figs. 1–4). We confirmed 
that the key spectral features arise from fully assembled photosystems 
(Supplementary Information section 1.5.4.).
To probe the effect of exogenous electron mediators on the pho-
todynamics of cyanobacterial cells, we repeated the same measure-
ments with the addition of DCBQ. As shown in Fig. 1e, we found that 
addition of DCBQ led to accelerated decay dynamics of the negative 
feature at 685 nm. Simultaneously, the signal rise observed at 715 nm 
was suppressed, with a noticeable effect evident in just 600 fs after 
photo-excitation. The effect was also observed when pumping at the

band edge of the reaction centres (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). These 
observations demonstrate that DCBQ can alter the excited state decay 
pathways of the photosynthetic reaction centres in Synechocystis cells 
on a subpico-second timescale.
Previously, DCBQ has been thought to extract electrons only from the 
terminal electron acceptor site of PSII, the QB pocket (Fig. 1c). However, 
we note that the mid-point potential of DCBQ (+0.315 V versus standard 
hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 7)14 makes it suitable for extracting 
electrons from both PSI (P700*/P700+ = −1.290 V, FB/FB
− = −0.590 V)15 
and PSII (P680*/P680+ = −0.660 V)16. To rule out energy transfer from 
the reaction centres to DCBQ as the mechanism resulting in the obser-
vations shown in Fig. 1e, we characterized the optical properties of 
suspensions of cells in the presence of DCBQ. As reported in Fig. 2b, the 
absorption spectrum of cells includes prominent absorption bands at 
450, 680 and 700 nm corresponding primarily to the chlorophylls in the 
cell’s PSII and PSI complexes, whereas DCBQ absorbs below 300 nm. 
The lack of overlap in the absorption spectra of DCBQ before reduc-
tion and fluorescence of the intact cells indicates that energy transfer 
mechanisms in the form of Förster resonances are not active9. After 
considering possible quenching mechanisms, we conclude that the 
effect caused by DCBQ must stem from an electron transfer mechanism 
(more detail in Supplementary Information section 1.5.5.).
It is known that all chlorophylls embedded within PSII and PSI are 
energetically degenerate at room temperature. Photo-excitation 
thus results in a highly delocalized excited state shared across several  
chlorophylls17,18. Previous studies on isolated reaction centres from the 
photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides 
at 77 K showed that the initially excited state shows charge-transfer 
character and can form intermediate charge-transfer states within 
200 fs (ref. 19). Similarly, recent femtosecond crystallography results 
of the photosynthetic reaction centre of another purple non-sulfur 
bacterium Blastochloris viridis (formerly known as Rhodopseudomonas 
viridis) demonstrated electron transfer reactivity within 3 ps (ref. 20).
In the light of these observations, we postulate that photo-excitation 
of the chlorophyll pigments within the photosystems of Synechocystis 
at room temperature can also form highly delocalized intermediate 
charge-transfer states within the time resolution of our measurement 
(200 fs), followed by electron transfer kinetics. Given that the cell 
absorption spectra for all DCBQ concentrations remained unchanged 
(Supplementary Fig. 22), we conclude that DCBQ does not tightly bind 
to the chlorophylls at the core of the reaction centre. Instead, DCBQ 
most likely interacts with peripheral chlorophyll pigments protruding 
from the protein scaffold of the photosystems, thereby interacting with 
the highly delocalized charge-transfer state formed after the initial 
photo-excitation (Fig. 2a, also see Supplementary Information for 
in-depth discussion).
On the basis of this assessment, we constructed a simple kinetic 
model (Supplementary Fig. 14) and applied global analysis techniques 
to time-resolved TA data from cells to extract the relevant lifetimes. 
We then used this model to determine how efficiently DCBQ diverts 
electrons away from the native electron transfer chain (Supplementary 
Information section 1.5.3.). As highlighted in Fig. 2c, our analysis yielded 
declining electron transfer lifetimes for increased DCBQ concentra-
tion. On the basis of our model and these values, we can estimate that

Scale bar, 5 µm. b, Schematic of a cell showing intracellular thylakoid membranes 
(green). c, Schematic of a simplified photosynthetic electron transport chain. 
The chain starts with PSII, in which a special pair of chlorophylls known as P680 
is photoexcited to P680* directly or by energy transfer from other chlorophylls. 
An initial charge separated state with the primary electron acceptor pheophytin 
(Ph) [P680+⋅–Ph−] is formed with a lifetime of 10–30 ps (ref. 34) driving water 
oxidation. The extracted electrons exit PSII through terminal plastoquinones 
QA and QB. The electrons are shuttled along the chain, with the first diffusion 
step at roughly 10 ms (ref. 35). The electrons are received by PSI and with further 
input of light, the P700 is photoexcited to P700* and an initial charge separated 
state with the primary electron acceptor chlorophyll A0 [P700+⋅–A0
−] is formed 
with a lifetime of roughly 1–3 ps (ref. 36). The electrons exit PSI through the 
terminal iron-sulfur clusters FA and FB. The electrons are shuttled through 
ferredoxin (Fd) that takes around 500 ns (ref. 37) and then onto various 
pathways, including the Calvin–Benson cycle. On the addition of the electron 
mediator DCBQ (orange circle), a new electron transfer pathway forms (orange 
arrow). d,e, Ultrafast TA spectroscopy map of wild-type cells (d) and cells with

1 mM DCBQ diverts 17 ± 6% of the initial photoexcited reaction centre  
population in wild-type Synechocystis cells. Critically, this electron 
transfer occurs as early as 600 fs (Fig. 1d,e), which is consistent with 
our hypothesis that electrons can be extracted from rapidly formed, 
delocalized chlorophyll charge-transfer states.
Further support for this mechanistic picture stems from further 
control experiments with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea 
(DCMU), which binds to the QB pocket in PSII (ref. 21), competing 
against DCBQ docking and reduction thereafter. Here, the TA meas-
urements with DCBQ and DCMU yielded similar effects to those 
with only DCBQ, indicating that DCBQ acts at the initial stages of the  
photosynthetic pathway, rather than only at the QB site (Fig. 2d and 
Supplementary Fig. 15). This trend is also supported by analogous 
photo-electrochemistry measurements, in which DCBQ was observed 
to extract electrons at a site that is alternative to the QB site (roughly 
30% of the photocurrent, Supplementary Fig. 26).
The ability of DCBQ to interact with the photosynthetic electron trans-
port chain at longer timescales was also probed. Photoluminescence 
decay measurements revealed a reduction in luminescence lifetime 
with increasing DCBQ concentration, consistent with pulse ampli-
tude modulation fluorometry studies of eukaryotic algal cells in the  
presence of benzoquinones (Supplementary Fig. 28)3,14,22. This is con-
sistent with DCBQ interfering with the photosynthetic electron trans-
port chain beyond the pico-second timescales explored in TA. Oxygen 
evolution measurements confirmed that PSII continues to perform 
oxidation of water in vivo in the presence of DCBQ at all concentrations 
tested in the TA experiments, suggesting the pathway for holes gener-
ated by photo-excitation remains active on the addition of DCBQ (Sup-
plementary Fig. 30). However, a long-term cytotoxicity assay revealed 
that all concentrations of DCBQ greater than 200 µM are cytotoxic to 
the cells after 12 h, but there was no correlation between the cytotoxic-
ity of benzoquinones and their ability to re-direct electrons from the 
electron transport chain (Supplementary Fig. 31).
We tested two other common benzoquinone mediators, phenyl-1, 
4-quinone (PPBQ) and 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ), which 
have comparable mid-point potentials to DCBQ14,23. Figure 2d outlines 
that the early onset decay in the TA spectrum found for DCBQ was not 
observed in PPBQ- and DMBQ-treated cells (Supplementary Informa-
tion section 1.6., Supplementary Fig. 15). Similarly, complementary 
photo-electrochemistry experiments highlighted that DCBQ was the 
only benzoquinone screened that was reduced earlier than QB in PSII 
in vivo, as it mediated electron transfer to electrodes in the presence of 
DCMU (Supplementary Fig. 26). The observation that PPBQ and DMBQ 
did not demonstrate early interactions with the reaction centres may 
originate from poor protein–molecule association effects or their lower 
solubilities in aqueous solutions, which may lead to the quinones being 
sequestered in intracellular membranes and precipitating in aqueous 
compartments as they entered the cell14.

Next, we set out to explain the action of DCBQ electron extraction 
from different stages of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. 
To this end, we carried out ultrafast TA spectroscopy on the photosys-
tems in vivo with genetically engineered Synechocystis lacking either 
PSI or PSII intact protein complexes (Fig. 3a). These measurements 
were further complemented in vitro with isolated photosystems, 
with and without DCBQ. The full analysis of the data is presented in  
Supplementary Information. Briefly, the transient response of iso-
lated photosystems shows good agreement with previous reports 
with PSII dominated by a prominent bleach at 680 nm that decays on 
the nanosecond timescale6,24–26, whereas PSI shows a bleach signal 
at 690 nm and a lower-energy stimulated emission growing in and 
subsequently decaying on the pico-second timescale between 705 
and 720 nm (refs. 27–30). This latter feature originates from low-energy 
chlorophylls (so-called ‘red forms’), which are present in cyanobac-
terial PSI cores, albeit their exact spectral position can vary largely 
in different species27. We can therefore confidently assign the tran-
sient response to photo-excitation of P680 and P700 in PSII and PSI,  
respectively.
Whereas the mutant cells and isolated photosystems allow us to 
deconvolute the spectral features of the reaction centres, the changes in 
the lifetimes highlight the importance of observing the photodynamics 
of wild-type cells to obtain accurate insights into the photosynthetic 
electron transport chain. Following photo-excitation at 450 nm, the 
PSI-less mutant cells showed spectral features that were markedly dif-
ferent from wild-type cells (Fig. 3b, top panel). The PSI-less cells showed 
a long-lived bleach at its absorption maximum at 680 nm, lasting longer 
than a nanosecond. This spectral feature is well matched to that of 
isolated PSII, but shows a slower decay. This extended ground-state 
bleach probably arises as the natural charge-extraction pathways were 
blocked, or not fully functional, due to the absence of functional PSI. By 
contrast, the PSII-less cells showed more similar dynamics to wild-type 
cells, with the familiar low-energy spectral feature more than 690 nm 
also found in isolated PSI (Fig. 3b).
We then studied the effect of DCBQ addition on these mutant 
cells, as they most closely resemble our in vivo studies (full details in  
Supplementary Information section 1.7.). On the addition of 1 mM DCBQ 
to the PSI-less cells, we found a reduction from 74 to 53 ps in the lifetime 
of the short component of the signal (Fig. 3c, top panel). This suggests 
that electron extraction by DCBQ treatment from PSII in PSI-less cells 
occurs over a much longer timescale than the sub-20 ps quenching 
dynamics observed in the wild-type cells. By contrast, on the addition 
of 1 mM DCBQ to PSII-less cells, we found a reduction in the lifetimes 
that closely resembled the behaviour in wild-type cells.
Measurements of living cells are advantageous compared to the those 
of in vitro systems due to the robustness of the cells and the ability 
to study altered pathways produced by means of genetic engineer-
ing. However, in vitro measurements are useful in identifying spectral 
features due to their relative simplicity. Measurements of isolated PSI 
and PSII showed similar spectral features (Supplementary Informa-
tion section 1.7.) and lifetime reductions compared to mutant cells on 
the addition of DCBQ, further supporting our assignments and pro-
posed mechanism. Considering the in vitro and in vivo measurements 
together, we conclude that in the experimental arrangement described 
here, we primarily resolve electron transfer from PSI to DCBQ. This is in 
line with the more accessible nature of PSI compared to PSII. Although 
PSII is also weakly accessible to DCBQ in the PSI-less cells, no corre-
sponding long-lived signal is observed in the wild-type cells that can 
be directly assigned to PSII with sufficient statistical certainty.
Whereas the fast kinetics of DCBQ reduction by PSI in vivo is desir-
able, the positive mid-point potentials of benzoquinones limit the 
power densities they can generate or redox reactions they can catalyse 
in semi-artificial photosynthesis31. To test whether alternative classes 
of mediators can also extract charge through this non-classical path-
way, methyl viologen (MV2+/MV+⋅ = −0.325 V versus SHE at pH 7)32 was 
investigated. Methyl viologen is the most common synthetic mediator 
used in reductive catalysis and could unlock greater energy densities 
compared to DCBQ while bridging the gap between natural and artificial

photosynthesis. Our results are consistent with methyl viologen also 
being able to extract charge from PSI chlorophylls at the pico-second 
timescale in isolated PSI (Supplementary Fig. 20). This demonstrates 
that ultrafast electron extraction from photosystems is not limited to 
any one class of mediator molecules and opens new opportunities in 
mediator design and chemical generation.
Conclusion and outlook
Taken together, our results show that in vivo electron transfer from 
photosynthesis to various exogenous electron mediators is possible 
directly from the initially photoexcited states of the photosystems, 
that is, from the earliest possible step in the photosynthetic electron 
transport chain. This opens new possibilities for re-wiring biological 
photosynthesis and creates a link between biological and artificial pho-
tosynthesis. For example, manipulation of this non-classical pathway 
could mitigate the losses associated with light stress in biotechnological 
and agricultural applications, or help to channel charges out for alterna-
tive uses in power and chemical generation. Furthermore, these results 
call for a re-examination of mediated electron transfer strategies, which 
have long been used to study photosynthesis as well as for enhancing the 
performance of bioelectrochemical devices such as biophotovoltaics33. 
We also show that the pico-second charge-extraction pathway is not 
limited to one class of mediators, suggesting that the bioengineering 
of endogenous mediators, cascades and other biohybrid approaches 
could be used in the future to expand on and optimize this pathway.
These results also yield new insights into photosynthesis. Contrary 
to the current understanding that the excited reaction centres are 
insulated within the photosystem protein scaffold, the action of DCBQ 
and methyl viologen demonstrate that the scaffold is leaky. This is a 
potentially significant route in the cell for loss of electrons that might 
otherwise be used for photosynthesis and may have a role in photo-
protection or be a key cause of cell damage from production of reac-
tive oxygen species. More generally, our work highlights that in vivo 
ultrafast TA spectroscopic measurements are feasible and shows rich 
information on photoexcited dynamics of living systems. This could be 
a powerful new tool for understanding photosynthesis bioenergetics 
and its regulation, especially under conditions of light stress.

Methods
Biological samples
Cell culture and growth conditions. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 
(Synechocystis) cells were cultured photoautotrophically under 
50 µmolphotons m−2 s−1 of continuous white light at 30 °C in BG11 medium 
supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO3 (ref. 39). Liquid cultures were bub-
bled with air and shaken at 120 rpm, and 1.5% (w/v) agar was used in 
solid medium. Culture growth was measured by attenuance at 750 nm 
(optical density, OD750). Culture chlorophyll concentration (nmol Chl 
a ml−1) was calculated from absorbances at 680 and 750 nm: (A680–
A750) × 10.814 (ref. 40). All measurements were taken using a UV-1800 
Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu).
Photosystem-less mutants. The modifications to the culturing pro-
tocol for the Synechocystis photosystem-less mutants are as follows. 
Wild-type cells were cultured in BG11 with no additives at 30 °C with 
40 µmolphotons m−2 s−1 light. PSI-less (psaAB−), with 10 µg ml−1 chlo-
ramphenicol, were cultured in BG11 plus 5 mM glucose, at 30 °C and 
5 µmolphotons m−2 s−1 light5. PSII-less cells (psbDIC−/psbDII−) with 10 µg ml−1 
chloramphenicol and 10 µg ml−1 spectinomycin, were cultured in BG11 
plus 5 mM glucose at 30 °C with 40 µmolphotons m−2 s−1 light41.
Olive mutant. The Synechocystis Olive mutant was generated previ-
ously by markerless disruption of the cpcBAC1C2 genes41. As reported 
previously, the Olive mutant has no phycocyanin discs in the PBS. The 
Olive mutant still has the allophycocyanin core of the PBS. Deletion of 
the entire PBS results in extremely poor growth41, so this mutant was 
not analysed in this study.
Isolated photosystems. In this study, whole cells of cyanobacterium 
Synechocystis were compared against PSII and PSI protein complexes 
isolated from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. 
PSII isolated from mesophilic Synechocystis is significantly more  
unstable than those extracted from T. elongatus. Previous studies have 
compared the photo-electrochemistry of PSII in vitro versus in vivo 
from T. elongatus and Synechocystis, respectively, for similar stability  
reasons42. The purified T. elongatus PSII was provided by the group  
of A.W. Rutherford (Imperial College London, UK). PSII dimers were 
isolated from T. elongatus using methods previously reported43. 
The PSII stock had a chlorophyll concentration of 2.4 mg ml−1 in 
2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) storage buffer (10% glyc-
erol, 15 mM MgCl2, 15 mM CaCl2, 1 M betaine, 40 mM MES (pH 6.5)). 
Purified PSI trimers were isolated from T. elongatus using methods 
previously reported44. The PSI stock had a chlorophyll concentration 
of 9.07 mg ml−1 in MES storage buffer. Isolated photosystems were 
stored in small aliquots in a liquid N2 Dewar flask, and a new aliquot 
was thawed on each day of experiments. Photo-electrochemistry and 
spectroscopy measurements on isolated photosystems were con-
ducted in MES buffer (50 mM KCl, 15 mM CaCl2, 15 mM MgCl2, 40 mM 
MES (pH 6.5)). The T. elongatus was cultured at 60 °C, the spectroscopy 
suite was maintained at less than 21 °C and the photo-electrochemistry 
set-up was controlled at 25 °C. Preparation methods for spectroscopy 
has been reported previously45.
Chemicals
Unless otherwise stated, all materials used throughout this research 
were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without fur-
ther purification. The exogenous electron mediators used in this 
study were (Supplementary Fig. 32): DCBQ (98%, Sigma-Aldrich), 
PPBQ (95%, ACROS Organics), DMBQ (97% Sigma-Aldrich) and MV2+ 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Benzoquinone candidates were selected from 
previous studies with Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by the group of  
F. Lemaître3,14,22,46. The photosynthetic electron transport chain inhibi-
tor used in this study was DCMU (98%, Alfa Aesar). DCMU was used as 
an inhibitor of PSII at the QB site21. Stocks of 100 mM DCBQ, 100 mM 
MV2+ and 100 mM DCMU were made in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) 
for addition to biological samples. Stocks of 10 mM DMBQ and PPBQ 
were made in ethanol for addition to biological samples, with 8.2 mM 
SDS where specified.
Ultrafast TA spectroscopy
Pico-second TA measurements were performed as previously 
reported47,48. In brief, we used an Yb-based amplified system (PHAROS,  
Light Conversion) providing 14.5 W at 1,030 nm and a 38 kHz repeti-
tion rate. The probe beam is generated by focusing a portion of the 
fundamental in a 4 mm YAG substrate to generate a white light that 
spans 520 to 900 nm. The pump beam is generated by seeding a portion  
of the fundamental to a narrow band optical parametric oscillator  
(ORPHEUS-LYRA, Light Conversion). The pump pulse was set to 450 nm, 
unless otherwise indicated. The sample solutions were placed in 1 mm 
path length cuvettes (Hellma). The pump and probe beams were 
focused to sizes of 280 × 240 and 55 × 67 μm, respectively. The probe 
is delayed relative to the pump using a computer-controlled transla-
tion stage (Newport), and a chopper wheel (Thorlabs) modulated the 
pump beam to gain access to differential TA spectra. The probe pulses 
transmitted through the sample were detected on a single-shot basis 
by a line camera (Stemmer Imaging). All measurements presented in 
our work were acquired within 15 min of loading the sample. Further 
control experiments exposed the cells to the laser for 120 min (eightfold  
longer).
Time-correlated single-photon counting
To record the time-resolved photoluminescence decay of the sam-
ples, time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) was performed. 
Samples were excited with a pulsed laser (PicoQuant LDH-400-B and 
LDH-470-B (at up to 40 MHz, typically operated at 2.5 MHz)) at either 
407 or 470 nm, with the resulting photoluminescence decay collected 
on at 680 ± 10 nm. Diode lasers were controlled by a trigger box/power 
supply unit (PDL 800-B, PicoQuant). TCSPC used an emission spec-
trometer (Lifespec-ps unit, VTC900 PCI card, Edinburgh Instruments) 
with a multi-channel plate detector (R3809U-50, Hamamatsu). The 
instrument response was determined by scattering excitation light 
into the detector using a piece of frosted glass; a value of 265 ps was 
obtained. Pulse energy was 2 pJ. Pulse width of the diode lasers were 
measured to be 80 ps (full-width at half-maximum).
Spectroelectrochemistry
Solutions of DCBQ (1 mM) in BG11 medium and MES buffer were pre-
pared. The DCBQ solution (1 ml) was loaded into an optically trans-
parent thin-layer electrochemical cuvette with a pseudo reference 
electrode (Ag wire). Cyclic voltammetry was performed (applied poten-
tial 0.5 to −0.2 V versus pseudo reference Ag wire, scan rate: 0.05 V s−1) 
to determine that the working electrode poised at −0.1 V would reduce 
the DCBQ. The ultraviolet-visible light spectrometer was baselined with 
a solution of 1% DMSO (v/v) in BG11 medium or MES buffer as appro-
priate. The spectrum of the DCBQ solution was measured without 
applying a potential (neutral form). Chronoamperometry experiments 
were performed at −0.1 V. At 30 min into the chronoamperometry, 
the spectrum of the DCBQ (doubly reduced form) solution was  
measured.
Photo-electrochemistry
All photoelectrochemical measurements were performed at 25 °C 
under atmospheric conditions using an Ivium Technologies Compact-
Stat, with an Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) reference electrode (corrected 
by +0.197 V for SHE) and a platinum mesh counter electrode. Chrono-
amperometry experiments were performed at an applied potential 
0.5 V versus SHE. Chronoamperometry experiments were performed 
at a sampling rate of 1 s−1, under light and dark cycles using a collimated 

Article
LED light source (50 µmolphotons m−2 s−1, roughly 1 mW cm–2 equivalent, 
680 nm, Thorlabs).
Protein-film photo-electrochemistry. Inverse opal indium-tin oxide 
(IO-ITO) electrodes with 750 nm pore sizes were prepared using a pre-
viously reported method43. Protein-film photo-electrochemistry was 
performed as previously reported42. In brief, a one-in-three dilution 
of the 2.4 mg ml−1 (77 µM) stock solution of isolated PSII was made 
immediately before adsorption on the electrodes to give a final con-
centration of 25.6 μM. A small aliquot (1 μl) of the new solution was 
drop-cast onto 750 nm IO-ITO electrodes and left to stand for 15 min in a 
closed Petri dish in the dark before being used in photoelectrochemical 
experiments. The electrolyte was MES buffer (pH 6.5). Light/dark cycles  
(15 s on/15 s off) were used.
Cell photo-electrochemistry. IO-ITO electrodes with 10 μm macropo-
res and 3 μm interconnecting channels at a thickness of 40 µm were 
prepared using the method previously reported42. Photo-electrochem-
istry of cyanobacterial cells was performed as previously reported49. 
In brief, planktonic cultures of early stationary phase cyanobacte-
rial cells at an attenuance at OD750 of around 1 were concentrated by 
centrifugation at 5,000g for 10 min, the supernatant removed, and 
the pellet resuspended in fresh BG11 medium to a concentration of 
150 nmol Chl a ml−1. This solution (250 μl) was drop-cast onto the  
IO-ITO electrodes and left overnight at room temperature in a humid 
chamber in the dark to allow cell penetration and adhesion, yielding 
cell-loaded electrodes that were used for analysis 16 h later. The elec-
trolyte was BG11 medium (pH 8.5). Light/dark cycles (60 s on/90 s off)  
were used.
Oxygen evolution measurements
Oxygen evolution measurements were made using a Clark electrode 
consisting of an Oxygraph Plus Electrode Control Unit, S1 Oxygen 
Electrode Disc, DW2/2 Electrode Chamber and a LED1 High Intensity 
LED Light Source (Hansatech Instruments). Measurements were per-
formed on 1.5 ml samples of wild-type Synechocystis cells containing 
10 µg ml−1 of Chl a in BG11 supplemented with different concentra-
tions of DCBQ. Measurements were collected at 25 °C with 1 min of 
darkness, followed by 1 min of 1,500 µmolphotons m−2 s−1 light at 627 nm 
(equivalent to 28.65 mW cm−2). The rate of oxygen production in the 
dark was subtracted from that in the light and normalized to Chl a 
content. Data were collected from five biological replicates, each with 
three technical replicates.
Cytotoxicity assays
Wild-type Synechocystis cells (5 nmol Chl a) were incubated with 
different concentrations of exogenous mediator for 24 h. Synecho-
cystis cells incubated in BG11 with no electron mediator or in BG11 
with 5% (v/v) DMSO solvent under the same conditions were used as 
controls. Following incubation, the cells were resuspended in fresh 
BG11 and their concentration was standardized to an OD750 of 0.5.  
Aliquots (10 μl) of three serial dilutions (×1, ×10−3, ×10−6) were spotted 
on BG11 agar plates, which were then incubated for 1 week at 30 °C and 
50 µmolphotons m−2 s−1 light. The growth of the cells pre-incubated with 
mediator was compared to the controls to assess the cytotoxicity of the  
mediators.
Statistics
The ratios of the lifetime of samples on the addition of benzoquinones 
and DCMU compared to when nothing was added were compared using 
Student’s t-tests.
