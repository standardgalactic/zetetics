Higher spins: For spin-s particles, s ∈1
2Z, the matrices analogous to the Pauli
spin matrices are 3 complex (2s + 1) × (2s + 1) matrices. Higher dimensions: If
physical space had dimension d instead of 3, there would be d(d −1)/2 Pauli spin
matrices, as that number is the dimension of the rotation group SO(d).

Photoelectric Effect
Bruce R. Wheaton
When electromagnetic radiation strikes a metal,  electrons are released. This
simple statement hides a considerable history stretching back to Galvani and not
plumbed entirely to this day.
In its initial form, the effect was discovered by Heinrich Hertz (1857–94) during
his path-breaking corroboration of Maxwell’s laws in 1887. He was using spark-
discharges in one part of his laboratory in Karlsruhe to stimulate other, much weaker
ones, in another. To see the weaker ones he began to shield his eyes from the bright
primary spark, then, inspired, realized that the length of the weak ones diminished
when the blue primary spark light failed to reach the secondary electrodes. He called
it “a peculiar and surprising property of the spark,” showed by elimination that the
ultra-violet light of the primary eased the secondary sparks from the metal elec-
trodes, and put the matter out for others to investigate because it deterred him from
his Maxwellian objective.
Many took up the challenge with telling results. Wilhelm Hallwachs (1859–1922)
in Dresden gave it its modern form when he found that ultra-violet light from almost
any source will discharge a negatively-charged zinc plate. Augusto Righi (1850–
1920) in Padua named the device a “coppia fotoelettrica.” By 1889 both Hallwachs
and Righi showed that a neutral plate will acquire a positive charge from the action.
One must note here that the concept of the “electron” did not exist except in a few
prescient minds at the time, so the active mechanism remained unclear.

That circumstance changed in the mid-1890s with the pioneering investigations
of ion-currents by Joseph John Thomson (1856–1940)at the famous Cavendish Lab-
oratory in Cambridge. He studied  cathode-rays in the newly possible vacuum:
streams of negative electricity visible and accessible to quantitative study within
those glass vacuum tubes. Convinced that there was a negatively-charged “corpus-
cle” constituting the beam, he sought all means to measure its properties. In 1898,
after proclaiming its existence by a clever determination of its charge/mass ratio
using crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds, he eagerly sought its charge; the photo-
electric effect made it possible.
If his electrons were emitted from the plate AB in Fig. 1, passing them through a
magnetic ﬁeld would bend them into cyclodial trajectories.1 Were he then to probe
the region of the plate with an electrical collector CD, the height of their cycloid

plate AB. He then moved AB closer to grid CD until it ﬁrst collected charge. From Thomson

side describe tortured paths not pictured but that never reach the full excursion from plate AB.

(hence their velocity) was easily measured, as in Fig. 2. So the photoeffect gave
the ﬁrst accurate determination of the charge e in 1899. This was 7 years before
Millikan’s oil-drop experiment.
Philipp Lenard (1862–1947) was convinced, like his mentor Hertz, that the cath-
ode rays were ætherial disturbances. So in 1902 he tried and failed to disprove
Thomson’s results. In the most far-reaching study of photoelectric emission to the
time, he found that the velocity of emitted cathode rays seemed entirely independent
of the intensity of radiation, but only depended on the type of light used. He did not
say it depended on the frequency or color of the light and concluded that there was
therefore no conversion of radiant energy to electron kinetic energy occurring in
the effect, but that some sort of resonant action of the light would “trigger the re-
lease of electrons” from metal atoms with the energy they had possessed within the
atom. Until he ﬁnally rejected this “triggering” action in 1911, his views formed the
majority opinion amongst physicists because the energy of released photo-electrons
seemed entirely too great to have collected from a wave-front of radiation in the very
short time (<10−3 s.) which Alexandr Stolyetov (1839–96) in Moscow had found it
to occur in 1889.
Far in the background lay the heretical proposal in 1905 by the unknown Albert
Einstein (1879–1955) that there must be a particulate nature to ultra-violet light. In
1905, as part of his recasting of physics, he derived a linear law for the electric po-
tential that stopped the fastest released electrons as proportional to the frequency, not
the intensity of the incident light. This “quantum transformation relation” or (QTR)
side-stepped the æther altogether in favor of a  “light-quantum” interpretation of
ultra-violet (and visible) radiation. In reaction to Planck’s statistical “quantum” of
1900, Einstein’s physical light-quantum carried energy proportional to frequency,
and was absorbed in quantum units. Einstein was well aware of Lenard’s ﬁndings
but explained them in an entirely different (he said “truly revolutionary”) manner.
Why “revolutionary”? Were light a continuous wave, how did the atom know when
enough energy had been absorbed?
In 1913, Einstein’s light-quantum was judged “erroneous” by leading German
physicists. Even in 1916, when Millikan showed Einstein’s linear photoeffect law to
be entirely accurate empirically, the idea was almost universally rejected (even by
Millikan.) But Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize for the idea when tides began
to turn. The  Compton Effect and Louis de Broglie’s hypothesis of  matter waves
