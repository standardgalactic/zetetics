able, niost of tihem mfavorable, concerning the feasibility 
of covering the .1 KHz t o  20 KHa frequency range.

The design objective frequency r a g e  of 100 Hz t o  20,000

6 times the lowest frequency of tne array. 
The manufacturing problems associated with the arrays

The conclusion t o  be drawn from the above discussion i s  
that for each signal to be analyzedp a bandwidth should be 
chosen meeting both the resolution requirements and response 
time requirements, 
This i s  not always possible. 
With regard 
t o  t h i s  program Sperry does not know what the nature of the 
signals to be analyzed is except that they are probably noise- 
like. 
Furthermorep the range of bandwidths obtainable by 
means of vibrating fibers i s  rather small a t  present say 5 to 
40 Hz over the 100 to 6000 Hz range. 
In generalp several 
analyses with different bandwidths may be necessary to c a p  
ture parts of the signal spectrum, 
Certainly, in the initial 
stages of signal analysis, several bandwidths should be tried 
to see which gives the best resuits, 
The optimum fiber spacing is a function of the fiber band- 
width. 
The basic consideration i s  that the fiber spacing 
should be m a l l  enough 650 that the signal spectrum can be

and the input frequencies are spaced 1.5 bandwidths. 
The 
l a s t  example (figure 7b) i s  the same except the two input 
frequencies are one bandwidth apart. 
These examples show that the smoothing technique employed 
works rather w e l l  when the fibers are spaced one-half band- 
widA&. 
Particularly,, it should be noted that the peak values 
of the smoothed curves are nearly independent of the positions 
of the fibers relative t o  the curves, 
Also two frequencies 
1.5 bandwidths apart can be resolved, 
one bandwidth apart cannot be resolved for the choice of 
fiber positions i n  figure 7b, This figure i s  of interest 
because it shows that an ideal array (infinitesimal fiber 
spacing) would j u s t  re solve frequencies one bandwidth apart. 
To maintain t h i s  resolution i n  a practical array would re- 
quire that the fibers be spaced roughly one-third bandwidth 
apart (the spacing must be somewhat smaller than the separa- 
tion of m h s P  and maares,, according to the sampiing theorem). 
When the fiber spacing is one bandwidth, the array perform- 
ance deteriorates considerabiy, 
The peak values depend t o  a 
greater extent on the relative positions of the fibersonthe 
curves, 
More seriously, the array resolution is three band- 
widths rather than the 1.5 bwAdwidths obtained with the smaller

Sources of Noise With Steady State Signals 
There are two noise phenomena that occur when complex 
steady state signals are applied t o  the array. 
These are 
called chopping noise and signal induced noise i n  t h i s  report.

The dwell time

The 
maximum and minimum amplitude is just the sum and difference

To remove this ripple, the photosensitive sur-

If the array i s  scanned, the scanner should dwell on each 
fiber a time consistent with the bandwidths mentioned above. 
This imposes serious limitations on the scan speed,

Factors Affecting Fiber Bandwidth 
Fiber bandwidth arises from three causes, These are aero- 
dynamic dampifig, fiber hysteresis dampang and hysteresis dmping

~n exact 
analysis of these sources of damping would be very difficult. 
Howeverp an approximate analysis i s  possible and combined with 
experimental data, allows design formala to be obtained. 
Aerodynamic damping w i l l  be considered first. As can be seen 
from figures 1 and 2 the fiber has a paddle like shape. 
When it 
vibrates, aerodynamic drag damps. the fiber. 
This effect is en- 
hanced by placing the static mask close to the fibers, because 
this increases the a i r  velocity around the fibers. 
An approxi- 
mate expression for bandwidth i n  terns of fiber geometry has been 
obtained. It shows that the bandwidth i s  independent of frequency.

The turling accuracy would be i2 Hz on tine average for 
the lowest thme arrays and k5 Hz on the average for the high 
frequency array, 
The lengths of the arrays would be about .5# 2, 2, 2 inches 
respectively from low t o  high frequency assuming fiber thick- 
ness of .004p .,004, .002, .001 inch respectively and band- 
widths of 20, 20, 20, 40 Hz respectively.

The frequency resolution given in the table is based uprA 
the discussion of smoothing i n  ,Section 2,2,dp and the aliasing 
e r m r  i s  also, The aliasing error Pefera to the difference 
between the peak values of the spatially smoothed array output 
when the input frequency f a U s  at a fiber Erequency and when it 
falls midway between two fibers, 
The input range refers t o  the peak input displacement de-
