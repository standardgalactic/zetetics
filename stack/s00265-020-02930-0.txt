Abstract
The behaviour of animals is strongly influenced by the detection of cues relating to foraging opportunity or to risk, while the
social environment plays a crucial role in mediating their behavioural responses. Despite this, the role of the social environment in
the behaviour of non-grouping animals has received far less attention than in social species. Here, we present the results of an
experiment on a cryptic species of goby (Pseudogobius sp.), which does not form social groups in its natural habitat. Gobies were
presented sequentially with chemical cues relating to food, conspecific alarm and control, while in the presence of conspecifics.
The intermittent locomotory behaviour of the gobies, which is typical of many cryptic animals, was influenced by the type of cues
presented. Gobies decreased the duration of bouts of stasis in the presence of food cues and were generally more active. By
contrast, those detecting alarm cues decreased the duration of movement bouts and were generally less active. In line with
previous studies involving shoaling species, gobies in the presence of food cues adopted a more dispersed distribution, while
clustering together in the presence of alarm cues. Finally, we used calculations of transfer entropy as a means of inferring
information transfer among experimental subjects. In contrast to previous studies that have focused on social species, transfer
entropy between gobies was detectable only in the conspecific alarm treatment. Taken together, our results show that members of
this cryptic species detect and respond to chemical cues by adjusting their movement and distancing to conspecifics. Furthermore,
they augment their own information with social cues but only when they perceive a threat.
Significance statement
Animals are routinely exposed to an array of cues within their environment that convey valuable information about risk and
foraging opportunities and must adapt their behaviour accordingly. To facilitate this, animals often use information arising from
the behaviour of conspecifics to inform their own responses; however, this has rarely been considered in species which do not
exhibit strong grouping tendencies. We used a non-shoaling fish, the goby (Pseudogobius sp.), to examine both their responses to
ecologically relevant cues and the effect of the social environment on these responses. The gobies adapted their distances relative
to one another according to the cues present and responded most strongly to information arising from conspecifics (measured as
transfer entropy) in the presence of a potential threat. This demonstrates the potential importance of social information even to
species that do not live in social groups with others of their own kind.

Animal behaviour is profoundly influenced by the detection of
ecologically relevant cues in the environment. In particular,
cues relating to foraging opportunities, or to levels of risk,
may elicit strong responses. Detection of food cues may pro-
mote active foraging behaviour, which often manifests as
greater activity and changes in movement profiles as animals
seek to locate the source of the cues (Schaerf et al. 2017;
Hansen et al. 2020). By contrast, alarm cues may elicit more
risk-averse behaviour, often characterised by decreased levels
of activity (Chivers and Smith 1993; Wudkevich et al. 1997;

Hazlett and Schoolmaster 1998). For prey animals, the ability
to modify behaviour according to the risk of predation is in-
tegral to fitness and survival. The failure to tailor threat-
sensitive behaviours to the immediate risk of predation risk
can be fatal, while being overly cautious attracts opportunity
costs, for instance missing out on the chance to forage
(Helfman 1989; Lima and Dill 1990; Ferrari et al. 2009;
Webster and Laland 2012). Thus, the ability to effectively
navigate the trade-off surrounding threat-sensitive behaviours
forms a central element of a prey animals’ behavioural reper-
toire. As such, prey animals tend to exhibit patterns of behav-
iour which accommodate their need to negotiate this trade-off
effectively. For cryptic prey animals relying on camouflage,
successful predator avoidance relies heavily on their ability to
remain undetected. Previous studies have shown that camou-
flage alone does not form a complete cryptic strategy; cryptic
animals must also moderate their movement behaviour in or-
der to effectively avoid detection (Houtman and Dill 1994;
Ioannou and Krause 2009). For this reason, these animals tend
to exhibit behaviour such as intermittent movement, where
bursts of movement are punctuated by periods of stillness, as
this preserves the effectiveness of their camouflage while still
enabling them to navigate their environment as needed
(O’Brien and Evans 1991; Kramer and McLaughlin 2001).
For such animals, adapting the bout lengths of movement or
stasis according to external cues likely represents an adaptive
strategy, for example, increasing the duration of bouts of stasis
and/or decreasing the duration of movement bouts when risk
is greater.
Social information, in particular, that derived from observ-
ing the behaviour of conspecifics, is a key modifier of behav-
iour. For example, the transmission of social information in
animal groups is fundamental to the expression of coherent
collective behaviour (Fernandez-Juricic and Kacelnik 2004;
Ballerini et al. 2008; Wilson et al. 2019). Animals also often
use social information to inform decisions regarding context-
dependent changes in behaviour. Prey animals tend to adopt
patterns of movement and behaviour which complement their
predator aversion strategies (Humphries and Driver 1970;
Bode et al. 2010; Schaerf et al. 2017), and these threat-
sensitive patterns of movement are often influenced by those
of nearby conspecifics (Underwood 1982). For example, var-
ious species of prey animals have been shown to manifest
greater group cohesion and greater behavioural coordination
under higher perceived predation risk (Bode et al. 2010;
Schaerf et al. 2017; Kent et al. 2019).
Studies on a range of different species, including fishes,
rodents, ravens and primates, have demonstrated that move-
ment behaviour and exploration is often socially facilitated, as
the risk associated with such behaviours is mitigated by the
presence of other individuals through the effects of dilution
(Hughes 1969; Stöwe et al. 2006; Dindo et al. 2009; Ward
2012). Similarly, it has been shown that animals in larger
groups move in a qualitatively and quantitatively different
manner to those in smaller groups (Herbert-Read et al.
2013). Thus, social context has considerable influence on
the movement behaviour of individuals within a group.
However, the use of socially transmitted information to inform
behaviour is not limited to animals which manifest social at-
traction. Animals that do not live in social aggregations, in-
cluding many cryptic animals, also likely use information ac-
quired from conspecifics in a variety of contexts (Blanchet
et al. 2010). Although it has been established that locomotory
behaviour is central to the strategy of cryptic animals, little
research has been conducted to investigate how cryptic ani-
mals may use the socially acquired information to moderate
their movement behaviour.
In recent years, significant progress has been made in un-
derstanding how patterns of coordinated group movement
emerge from interactions between neighbours. Similarly, the
application of information-theoretic measures has allowed us
to quantify and thus better understand information transfer
between animals (Tomaru et al. 2016). In particular, transfer
entropy (Schreiber 2000) is an asymmetric measure that quan-
tifies the directed flow of information from one animal to
another based on the time series of their respective trajectories
(Ward et al. 2018). Specifically, it quantifies how the speed
and heading of an individual is influenced by that of its neigh-
bours. It has been used to demonstrate leader-follower rela-
tionships (Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2018), to evaluate how
social context influences locomotory decision-making
(Tomaru et al. 2016) and to examine how predator-prey inter-
actions are shaped by information transfer among prey
(Marras et al. 2012) and between predators and prey
(Handegard et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2015). These technologies
and techniques offer opportunities to further expand our un-
derstanding of the ways in which animals utilise socially trans-
mitted information to inform their patterns of behaviour under
different ecological contexts. Previous studies on information
transfer have primarily focused on animals in social groups
and report measurable transfer entropy (i.e. non-zero transfer
entropy) between group members across all contexts (Ward
et al. 2018; Wilson et al. 2019). However, less is known about
information flow among less sociable species, including many
cryptic animals. This is of importance since the locomotory
behaviour of cryptic animals is an integral part of their anti-
predatory strategy and it remains unknown whether this is
informed by social information.
The goby species used in the following experiments is non-
territorial and typically occurs at high densities throughout its
range (AW, pers. obs.). It does not, however, form shoals and
shows no evidence of social attraction towards conspecifics.
They exhibit intermittent movement, characteristic of many
cryptic prey animals, particularly those relying on camou-
flage. This makes them an ideal study species to address the
hypothesis that cryptic prey animals exhibit different patterns

of behaviour in regard to (a) movement, (b) spatial distribution
and (c) information transfer according to their external con-
text, defined here by the type of chemical cues present.
Specifically, we predicted that gobies would exhibit more
threat-sensitive behaviour when exposed to alarm cues than
when exposed to either food or control cues (Hoare et al.
2004), in particular, increasing their duration of stasis between
movements, decreasing their distance to near neighbours and
increasing their reliance on social information, measured as
transfer entropy.
Methods
Study system and animal husbandry
The goby Pseudogobius species 9, previously referred to as
Pseudogobius olorum, and part of a species complex under-
going taxonomic resolution, was used as the model species.
Members of this genus are widely distributed throughout tem-
perate, sub-tropical and tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific,
occurring in shallow freshwater, marine and estuarine habitats
(McGrouther 2019). The range of this species extends from
southern Queensland to Victoria. It grows to a maximum body
size of approximately 76 mm. The fish used in this experiment
measured 30 ± 5 mm and were likely juveniles. Due to the
absence of any clear sexual dimorphism, both sexes were used
for experimentation. Like many fish species, this goby is ca-
pable of changing its body colour in response to variation in
the physical environment. As is common among gobiids, this
species lacks a swim bladder and is adapted to a benthic life-
style spent in close association with the substrate. This species
is non-burrowing and demonstrates a characteristic intermit-
tent pattern of locomotion, with relatively long periods of
stillness punctuated by short hops forward.
Fish were collected from a field site at Middle Creek,
Narrabeen, NSW, Australia (33.718491° S, 151.270281° E)
in November 2019 and January 2020 using large hand-held
nets. Fish were captured in shallow waters approximately 5–
20 cm in depth. Permits for capture were obtained from the
NSW Department of Primary Industries. Following capture,
the fish were transported in oxygenated water to holding fa-
cilities at the University of Sydney. There, they were housed
in tanks containing substrate composed of natural sand and
variegated gravel, intended to represent a typical physical en-
vironment commonly encountered by this species in the wild.
Water temperature was maintained at 25 °C, with a salinity of
10 ppt, both of which are typical of the conditions experienced
by this species in the wild at the time of capture. Regular water
changes were conducted at fortnightly intervals. They were
fed daily with commercially available fish food (Nutrafin
Tropical Flakes, Hagen Products, Germany) and their health
was monitored prior to testing. To minimise observer bias,
blinded methods were used in the analysis of behavioural data
using tracking software. All experiments were approved by
the University of Sydney’s Animal Ethics Committee, ref
2019/1616.
Experimental apparatus
Experiments were performed in a flow-through arena measur-
ing 170 cm × 45 cm with walls of 10 cm height, filled to a
water depth of 7 cm (see Fig. 1). The arena was constructed of
white plastic, while compartments were created using mea-
sured and cut pieces of opaque, white Corflute®, 6 mm in
cross-section, fixed in place using aquarium sealant. The arena
was sub-divided widthwise into 6 compartments. The four
central compartments (35 cm × 45 cm) were used to house
experimental subjects. The arena also contained two smaller
compartments (25 cm × 45 cm) at either end, the rearmost of
which contained a Rio 200 pump (Taam Inc., California,
USA) which circulated water at a rate of 1.65 L/min to the
foremost compartment via a length of PVC tubing.
Constraining the pump and the inflow to their own separate
compartments enabled us to reduce any excess turbulence that
the subjects might otherwise experience. Rectangular vents
measuring 40 mm2 in the walls of each compartment allowed
water to flow between compartments. The vents were set into
the walls at a height of 25 mm and at alternate ends of the
walls (see Fig. 1). These vents were covered on both sides of
the dividers with two layers of fine mesh (with a mesh size of
1 mm). This double layer of mesh, coupled with the fact that
the gobies spend the majority of their time resting or swim-
ming in close proximity to the base of the arena, below the
level of the vents, meant that visual communication between
subjects in different compartments was minimal. The arena
was situated in a temperature-controlled room at the
University of Sydney, and the water in the arena was kept at
the same temperature and salinity as that of the holding tanks.
The arena was lit by LED lights (6500 K) and surrounded by
opaque, white corflute fixed to an aluminium frame along the
sides and above the arena (at a height of 500 mm) in order to
minimise visual disturbance to subjects. Lights were set to a
photoperiod identical to that used in holding conditions
(12:12-h light:dark).
Dye tests were performed in order to establish the rate at
which cues would flow through the arena following their in-
troduction to the compartment housing the pump. From this,
we established both the time taken for the cues to first enter
and then fully saturate each compartment. In each case, the
cues first entered a compartment approximately 50 s prior to
saturation of that compartment. The cues fully saturated the
first fish-holding compartment after 4 min, the second after 6
min, the third after 8 min and the final compartment after 10
min. We used this information to determine the point at which
we began filming each respective compartment.

Experimental protocol
We added four fish to each of the four compartments (to a total
of 16 fish) and allowed them to habituate for 24 h before
testing. Subsequently, three experimental treatments were per-
formed adding (1) food cues, (2) conspecific alarm cues or (3)
control cues over the next 3 days, so that fish were exposed to
one treatment per day. The order in which these treatments
were presented was randomised. Treatments were consistently
presented in the afternoon, between 3 and 5 pm.
Food cues were prepared by adding one heaped teaspoon
(approximately 15 mL) of flaked fish food to 200 mL of aged
fresh water. This mixture was stirred for 1 min until the food
and water were thoroughly mixed before the mixture was
sieved through a fine mesh in order to ensure that all
suspended particles were removed. Alarm cues were prepared
as per Schaerf et al. (2017). Two conspecific gobies were
humanely euthanised with a sharp blow to the head before
being macerated using a mortar and pestle. The resultant res-
idue was added to 200 mL of aged freshwater and sieved
through a fine mesh to remove any suspended solids. The
chemical cues produced by this method are a salient ecologi-
cal indicator of predator activity, mimicking the result of a
predation event. They are known to produce a response in a
variety of fish species (Chivers and Smith 1998; Wisenden
2000; Brown 2003). Control cues were prepared by simply
sieving 200 mL of water through a fine mesh. All equipment
was cleaned thoroughly in water, then left to soak in running
water for ~ 30 min and finally left to dry for 24 h between
treatment preparations in order to avoid cross-contamination.
At the beginning of each set of treatments, we added 200
mL of cues into the compartment housing the pump and began
timing. After 4 min had elapsed, filming of the first fish-
housing compartment was initiated, as per the results of the
dye test. Filming of the second, third and fourth compartments
began in 6, 8 and 10 min after the introduction of the cues
respectively. Trials were filmed from above, through small
(30 mm) holes cut into the ceiling of the screens. A Canon
G1X (Canon, Japan) was used, filming at 30 frames per sec-
ond and at a resolution of 1080 p. The small size of the aper-
tures, through which we filmed, and their distance from the
study animals minimised any disturbance caused by moving
the camera and we did not see any signs of disturbance
resulting from this. After the fish had undergone testing with
exposure to all three treatments (food, conspecific alarm, con-
trol), they were removed from the arena and placed in a hold-
ing tank in order to separate them from untested individuals.
The arena was then drained and cleaned before being refilled
and a new set of fish added. This procedure was repeated four
times (using a total of 64 fish) to a sample size of N = 16 (4
sets of fish × 4 trials). The analysis was only performed for 15
of the groups, due to signs of ill health in one individual during
the latter stages of testing.
The arena was not cleaned in between daily treatments on
the same groups. This was decided firstly on the basis that
flushing the arena after each treatment would likely expose
the fish to undue disturbance. Secondly, chemical cues pro-
vided during the treatments are known to have a short period
of persistence, breaking down rapidly and becoming biologi-
cally inactive and thus unable to produce a prolonged re-
sponse in the animals. Previous use of food and alarm cues
shows peak responses in experimental subjects within 1–10
min, inducing progressively weaker responses as the cues un-
dergo biochemical degradation and the fish habituate (Schaerf
et al. 2017). The estimated half-life of such cues is estimated
between 12 min and 7 h (Wisenden et al. 2009; Chivers et al.

flow is shown in blue, indicating the direction of flow from the rearmost
pump-housing compartment to the foremost compartment and through

width and height of each compartment are shown. The depth of the
compartments was 10 cm

2013). Since experimental groups were tested at 24-h inter-
vals, it was deemed sufficiently improbable that any cues
would remain. Nonetheless, the order in which the cues were
presented to each group was randomised in order to account
for any potential longer-term effects.
Data extraction
Clips of film from each group were cut and converted to AVI
format using VirtualDub (virtualdub.org) and were then
tracked using automated tracking software CTrax (Branson
et al. 2009). Although there was a duration of 2 min between
the commencement of filming of each compartment, part of
this was taken up with moving and repositioning the camera.
Consequently, we used the first 90 s of film for tracking,
during which the gobies first detected and responded to the
cues. At a frame rate of 30 fps, each tracked clip yielded 2700
data points per individual fish, per treatment, and was calibrat-
ed to millimetre.
Data analysis
Locomotory behaviour
We calculated the proportion of time spent moving, where a
goby was identified as moving at a given time if its speed
s(t) ≥1 mm/frame.
The analysis was performed using R (R Core Team 2013).
Data assumptions were tested using visual inspection of Q-Q
plots. To analyse the amount of time spent moving, we used
the raw data (i.e. the number of frames in which an individual
was moving) rather than proportional data for the analysis.
The response variable was positively skewed; hence, we spec-
ified a gamma distribution of errors in a generalised mixed-
effect model (glmer). ‘Treatment’ (control, alarm and food),
‘day’ (the day of testing; day 1, day 2 and day 3) and ‘com-
partment’ (compartments 1, 2, 3 or 4 within the arena, where
compartment 1 was closest to the inflow) were included as
fixed effects. We included compartment as a factor to examine
the possibility that experimental subjects in different compart-
ments could influence one another by producing disturbance
cues, particularly in response to the alarm cues (Bairos-Novak
et al. 2019; Meuthen et al. 2019). Day and compartment were
treated as fixed effects, rather than random effects, since in
both cases, there were fewer than the recommended minimum
number of levels (Clark and Linzer 2015). We included
‘group’ as a random effect to control for the repeated measures
nature of the data. In addition to the above, we examined for
the presence of multicollinearity by calculating the variance
inflation factor. Subsequently, we performed post hoc tests
using the glht function from the R package ‘multcomp’, spec-
ifying Tukey HSD tests.
Durations and frequencies of bouts of movement
and stillness
We determined the durations of all periods of movement or
stillness for all gobies across all experimental trials. We then
conducted a mixed-effect survival analysis, using the coxme
package for R to compare durations spent moving or still
across treatments (Therneau 2020). We treated any duration
of stillness or movement that commenced at the first frame of
observations or that was continuing at the end of observations,
as right censored, and all other durations as uncensored. We
constructed Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival functions with
95% confidence bounds for durations of movement or still-
ness for each treatment. Each survival function, S(t), repre-
sented the probability that a goby moved or was still for a
duration greater than t frames. We specified fixed and random
effects, and also performed post hoc testing, as described
above.
Distances between gobies
We calculated the mean distance between each fish and the
other fish within its experimental compartment at each frame
and then calculated a grand mean for each fish over the entire
trial. The mean neighbour distance response variable satisfied
the assumptions of normality; hence, we used a linear mixed-
effects model (lmer from the package lme4) to analyse mean
neighbour distance. We specified fixed and random effects,
and also performed post hoc testing, as described above.
Positions of neighbours relative to a focal individual
We used the methods described in detail in Schaerf et al.
(2017) to examine the statistical distribution of relative neigh-
bour positions relative to a focal individual. This function,
describing the distribution of relative neighbour positions,
was determined by first transforming to a consistent coordi-
nate system where a focal individual was located at the origin
(0,0), and the direction of motion of the focal individual was
parallel to the positive x-axis. A square domain centred on the
focal individual was then sub-divided into smaller overlap-
ping square bin regions. The larger square domain extended
over the region where −150 < x ≤150, −150 < y ≤150
(millimetres), that is, out to distances of approximately 5 body
lengths to the front and back, and to the left and right, of the
focal individual. The smaller square bin regions had side
lengths of 15 mm (approximately half a body length for the
gobies), with the leftmost and/or bottommost edges of adja-
cent bins separated by 3.75 mm (one-quarter of a bin width).
Square bins and the rectangular (x, y) coordinate system were
chosen so that each bin covered equal areas of the domain near
the focal individual (as opposed to bins based on distances to,
and angular ranges containing groupmates, where the area of
Page 5 of 12     19
Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2021) 75: 19

bins would grow as the distance from the focal individual
increased). The overlap of the bins is a means to smooth the
resulting plot, analogous to the moving window used to cal-
culate a moving average. The number of times that neighbours
occupied each bin was counted, with data aggregated by
treating all group members as the focal individual in turn.
Absolute counts in each bin were then normalised by dividing
by the total counts across all bins.
We adapted the randomisation method based on the mean
absolute difference between pairs of fitted functions (TMS
et al. unpubl. data) for across group comparisons to examine
if there was a significant difference across treatments. We
adjusted the thresholds for significance for the mean absolute
difference randomisation tests according to the Holm-
Bonferroni method (Holm 1979), to take into account multiple
pairwise comparisons.
In addition to the analyses presented as part of the main text
here, we considered a broader range of local interactions, in-
cluding alignment, speed, change in speed and change in
heading of a focal individual relative to the positions of near
neighbours which we present in the Supplementary
Information.
Information flow
Information flow between individuals in a group was quanti-
fied using measures of transfer entropy in the JIDT package
for MATLAB (Lizier 2014). Transfer entropy is an
information-theoretic measure which quantifies the directed
flow of information within a network (Schreiber 2000;
Bossomaier et al. 2016), in this case, as the degree to which
the trajectory of one individual is informed by the trajectory of
other individuals in the group. More generally, transfer entro-
py may be described in relation to two-time series within a
network, X and Y. For example, transfer entropy from X to Y
describes the reduction in uncertainty in predicting future
values of X based on previous values of Y in relation to pre-
vious values of X. This method of quantifying the directed
flow of information is often used to quantify social influence
and mutual information transfer within social networks. As
such, groups with a higher degree of directed information
transfer are expected to exhibit higher values of transfer
entropy.
Mean group transfer entropy was calculated for each ex-
perimental replicate from the relative speed of source fish to
speed changes in target fish, by creating samples of speeds
computed from the (x, y) coordinates of all source-target pairs
within a distance range of 300 mm (as detailed in Crosato et al.
2018) at all 2700 time steps in the replicate. We used the
Kraskov, Stögbauer and Grassberger estimator (Kraskov
et al. 2004) from the Java Information Dynamics Toolkit
open-source software (Lizier 2014) to compute the estimate.
We ran an optimisation for source-target lag, and history
embedding length k and delay tau (as detailed in Crosato
et al. 2018), determining these to be set as 2, 1 and 8. We
visually inspected the data using Q-Q plots and analysed using
the lmer function in the lme4 package for R, with the same
fixed and random effects described previously, and applying
the same post hoc testing procedure.
Finally, to assess whether a statistically significant (non-
zero) information transfer was occurring between fish within
treatment groups, we compared the mean group transfer en-
tropy observed in each treatment to a predicted null distribu-
tion (Lizier 2014). One sample of the transfer entropy under
the null distribution is empirically constructed by shuffling the
observations of source fish against the target past and future;
this maintains the transition dynamics of target fish but statis-
tically decouples these from source fish observations, consis-
tent with a null hypothesis of no observed information trans-
fer. For each treatment, we constructed 1000 samples from the
null distribution for transfer entropy and then compared the
observed transfer entropy for the treatment to this distribution
to compute a p value of observing such a transfer entropy if
the source fish do not add information to the trajectory of the
targets.
Results
Locomotory behaviour
There was a significant effect of treatment on the amount of
time spent moving by gobies (χ2 = 15.23, p < 0.001, see Fig.
2) but no effect of day (χ2 = 0.008, p = 0.996) or compartment
(χ2 = 2.745, p = 0.433). The marginal coefficient of determi-
nation (pseudo-r2) for the overall model was 0.348. Gobies in
the food treatment spent more time moving than those in the
alarm (Z = 3.073, p = 0.006) or control treatments (Z = 2.923,
p = 0.009). There was no difference in the time spent moving
between the alarm and control treatments (Z = 0.313, p =
0.946).
Durations and frequencies of bouts of movement and
stillness
There was a significant effect of treatment on the duration of
time spent static by gobies (χ2 = 28.381, p < 0.001, see Fig.
3a) but no effect of compartment (χ2 = 0.213, p = 0.6444) or
day (χ2 = 0.006, p = 0.981). Gobies exposed to food cues
engaged in shorter bouts of stillness than when exposed to
alarm cues (Z = 3.309, p = 0.003) or a control (Z = 4.994, p
< 0.001). There was no difference in the time spent static
between the alarm and control treatments (Z = 0.887, p =
0.646).
Similarly, there was a significant effect of treatment on the
amount of time spent moving by gobies (χ2 = 9.923, p =
19    Page 6 of 12

0.007, see Fig. 3b) but no effect of compartment (χ2 = 1.832,
p = 0.176) or day (χ2 = 0.163, p = 0.686). Gobies exposed to
alarm cues engaged in shorter movement bouts than when
exposed to food cues (Z = 2.528, p = 0.03) or a control (Z =
3.067, p = 0.006). There was no difference in the time spent
moving between the food and control treatments (Z = 1.041, p
= 0.548).
Distances between gobies
There was a significant effect of treatment on the mean dis-
tance between gobies (χ2 = 16.72, p < 0.001, see Fig. 4) but no
effect of day (χ2 = 2.45, p = 0.118) or compartment (χ2 =
1.347, p = 0.246). The marginal coefficient of determination
(pseudo-r2) for the overall model was 0.093. The mean dis-
tance between neighbours was greater in the control treatment
than in the alarm (Z = 2.881, p = 0.011) or food treatments (Z =
3.893, p < 0.001). There was no difference in the mean dis-
tance between neighbours between the food and alarm treat-
ments (Z = 0.957, p = 0.604).
Positions of neighbours relative to a focal individual
When in range (within 150 mm in the x- and y-directions),
other gobies most frequently occupied an annular region
centred on the focal individual (Fig. 5a–c). This region
seems to have been tighter for gobies subject to alarm
cues (Fig. 5a), and most diffuse for those subject to food
cues (Fig. 5c), with the differences across these treatments
identified as significant by a mean absolute difference
randomisation test (Table 1). A central circular region of
approximate radius 25 mm with lower relative frequencies
of groupmate occupancy is evident for alarm cue groups
(Fig. 5a), consistent with individuals maintaining a small
region of personal space even when other gobies were
more likely close by.

Transfer entropy
There was a significant effect of treatment on mean pairwise
transfer entropy (χ2 = 11.237, p = 0.004, see Fig. 6) but no
effect of day (χ2 = 4.514, p = 0.105) or compartment (χ2 =
1.573, p = 0.666). The marginal coefficient of determination
(pseudo-r2) for the overall model was 0.347. Gobies in the
alarm treatment showed higher levels of transfer entropy than
those in the food (Z = 2.35, p = 0.047) or control treatments (Z
= 2.259, p = 0.003). There was no difference in mean pairwise
transfer entropy between the food and control treatments (Z =
0.823, p = 0.689).
The transfer entropy measured in the alarm cue treatment
was significantly greater than predicted under a null distribu-
tion. By contrast, transfer entropy measured in the control and
food cue treatments was not significantly different from the
null distribution. From this, we can infer that information
transfer between individuals was detected in the alarm treat-
ment (p < 0.05) but not in the food treatment (p > 0.05) or the
control treatment (p > 0.05).

Discussion
The presence of water-borne chemical cues was found to pro-
duce significant effects on the behaviour of the gobies. In
particular, those exposed to alarm cues showed different pat-
terns of locomotion and a higher encounter frequency with
neighbours at a distance of one to two body lengths compared
to those in other treatments. Information transfer was greatest
in the alarm treatment than in either of the other two treat-
ments. Furthermore, this was the only treatment in which a
measurable (non-zero) amount of transfer entropy was
detected.
For prey animals, patterns of behaviour are largely defined
by trade-offs between the competing imperatives of predator
avoidance and other fitness-related activities, such as foraging
and courtship (Helfman 1989; Lima and Dill 1990; Ferrari
et al. 2009). For cryptic prey animals, many of these trade-
offs centre on decisions regarding whether or not to move, and
how to move. The perceived availability of food is known to
exert significant effects on the behaviour of animals. As
foraging opportunities are highly valuable and often highly
competitive, the incentive for animals to seek out these oppor-
tunities is high, even if they must expose themselves to risk to
do so. These factors likely explain the shorter durations of
stasis for gobies in the food treatment, relative to those in other
treatments, which resulted in a significantly greater proportion
of time spent moving. Contrastingly, when an alarm cue was
present, gobies responded by reducing the duration of their
movement bouts. Since cryptic animals often rely on immo-
bility to retain the benefits of camouflage, movement puts the
animals at greater risk of predation. Reducing movement
when the animals perceive the risk to be elevated likely rep-
resents an adaptive strategy to mitigate this (Houtman and Dill
1994; Martel and Dill 1995; Ioannou and Krause 2009). In
addition, studies have suggested that patterns of locomotion
are at least partly determined by the updating frequency of
visual information (Kramer and McLaughlin 2001; Bode
et al. 2010). Visual acuity relies on a series of discrete eye
movements including a fixation on objects within the visual
field, during which the eye must remain still relative to the
object (Carpenter 1988; Kramer and McLaughlin 2001). By
reducing the duration of movement bouts, particularly under
threat, prey animals potentially allow themselves to make a
more frequent and accurate assessment of ambient levels of
risk.
Gobies adapted their distances to conspecifics and their
patterns of distribution relative to those conspecifics accord-
ing to the cues present. In particular, those exposed to conspe-
cific alarm cues adjusted their spacing behaviour to concen-
trate in close proximity to near neighbours while the opposite
was true for those in the food cue treatment. This pattern is
similar to that found in shoaling fish species (Hoare et al.
2004; Schaerf et al. 2017). While the subjects of the present
experiment do not appear to shoal, this finding demonstrates
the general application and importance of concepts such as
domains of danger and the selfish herd, irrespective of social
tendency (Hamilton 1971; Morrell et al. 2011).
Information transfer between gobies was greatest when
alarm cues were present. This is compatible with previous
work which shows that animals exhibit greater responsiveness
to social information under threat than they do in other cir-
cumstances (Griffin 2004; Fallow and Magrath 2010;
McLachlan et al. 2019). However, this is the first time the
trend has been identified and quantified using information-
theoretic measures. Interestingly, information flow measured
as transfer entropy was only detected in the alarm cue treat-
ment and not in either the food or control treatments. This
differs from previous investigations of transfer entropy
centred on shoaling fish species which found non-zero transfer
entropy across all contexts (Crosato et al. 2018; Wilson et al.
2019), potentially because of greater mobility of many
shoaling species relative to the gobies used here, but supports
the generality of the findings that social information is

particularly important when under threat (Lima and Dill 1990;
Webster and Laland 2017). While the pairwise transfer entro-
py used here can be susceptible to conflating a common driver
effect (in this case, an independent response by each goby to
the cues) with the source effect (social information arising
from the behaviour of other gobies), our experimental ap-
proach of only collecting replicates once each compartment
was fully saturated with the alarm cue means that this com-
mon driver was controlled for in the information-theoretic
calculation. As a result, the transfer entropy detected here
relates to social information in the context of this alarm cue.
The context-dependent use of social information has re-
ceived considerable attention as it offers valuable insight into
how animals collect information and make decisions accord-
ing to both environmental and social context (Kendal et al.
2004; Webster and Laland 2012; Smolla et al. 2016).
However, despite the value of social information to animals
irrespective of their social tendencies, comparatively little re-
search in this area has focused on cryptic species and those
that do not typically live within groups (Webster and Laland
2017).
Avoiding detection by predators is central to the behaviour
of cryptic prey species, and the importance of appropriately
regulating bouts of movement and stasis in order to reduce the
probability of predation has been acknowledged in several
studies (Wright and O’Brien 1982; Martel and Dill 1995;
Ioannou and Krause 2009). Intermittent locomotion is a fea-
ture of a large and diverse range of animal species, for both
energetic and strategic reasons (Wilson and Godin 2010;
Paoletti and Mahadevan 2014). However, fine-scale changes
in movement profiles in response to varying levels of risk,
such as those examined here, have received little attention.
In the present experiment, we report changes in both the du-
ration of movement and the duration of stasis according to
context. A logical next step would be to examine how cryptic
animals manage potential trade-offs, such as when cues asso-
ciated with elevated risk coincide with cues that indicate for-
aging opportunities (Hazlett 1999). In addition, an important
future avenue for research would be to quantify the functional
benefits of changing movement strategies by conducting ex-
periments allowing interaction between predators and cryptic
prey. In these ways, important insights may be provided into
the ways in which changes to movement profiles translate to
different behavioural outcomes such as predator avoidance
and foraging success.
