ABSTRACT 
 
To fully realize the benefit of the two-group interfacial area transport equation (IATE) as 
a constitutive model for the interfacial area concentration in the two-fluid model, it is imperative 
that models be developed to dynamically transition from one-group to two-group flows. With this 
in mind, the two-group IATE is derived in detail to establish new expansion source terms that 
correctly account for the effects of intergroup bubble transport. In addition to this theoretical 
effort, the state-of-the-art four-sensor conductivity probe is used to establish a reliable 
experimental database of local two-phase flow parameters to characterize one-group to two-group 
transition flows and to support model development. The experiments are performed in vertical-
upward air-water two-phase flow in a 5.08cm pipe. Additionally, the local conductivity probe is 
improved through systematic studies into: 1) signal “ghosting” electrical interference among 
probe sensors, 2) sampling frequency sensitivity, 3) measurement duration sensitivity, and 4) 
probe sensor orientation. Wake-dominated bubble transport characterizes the transition from one-
group to two-group flows. Therefore, the necessary intergroup and intragroup wake entrainment 
source terms that are required for two-group interfacial area transport in transition flows are 
developed. Furthermore, an approach is developed to initiate the shearing-off source and reduce 
the one-group interaction mechanisms as an established two-group flow develops. The new 
interfacial area transport model for one-group to two-group transition flows is evaluated against 
the experimental database. The model accurately captures the exchange of void fraction and 
interfacial area concentration between group-I and group-II in transition flows. Overall, the 
group-I void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted within ±6% and ±4%, 
respectively, of the experimental data. The group-II void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration are predicted within ±9% and ±11%, respectively, of the experimental data.

Chapter 1
 
Introduction 
The study of gas-liquid two-phase flows is of great importance due to their impact on the 
safety and efficiency of various systems and processes in the nuclear energy, chemical 
manufacturing, petroleum, and other industries. The ability to predict the transport of mass, 
momentum, and energy in a two-phase flow is central to designing and maintaining many 
practical engineering systems. The most distinctive feature of a two-phase flow is the presence of 
one or more deforming interfaces that separate the two phases. The interfaces can take on a 
multitude of different configurations, which gives rise to a complex and dynamic interfacial 
structure. Owing to the complexity of two-phase flows, there exists a wide range of modeling 
approaches. It is outside the scope of the present dissertation to review all of the available 
approaches. However, a brief overview of one approach, the two-fluid model, is provided in 
Section 1.1 to provide necessary background for the current research. Specifically, the importance 
of the interfacial area concentration (𝑎𝑖), a fundamental geometric two-phase flow parameter that 
describes the surface area of the interface separating the phases per unit mixture volume, is 
established. In Section 1.2, a survey of the pertinent literature related to the development of the 
interfacial area transport equation as a constitutive model for the interfacial area concentration in 
the two-fluid model is performed. In view of the literature survey, the significance and 
uniqueness of the current dissertation is highlighted in Section 1.3, and the major objectives of 
this dissertation are outlined in Section 1.4.

1.1 Research Background 
1.1.1 Two-Fluid Model 
 
In principle, it is possible to develop a local instantaneous two-phase flow formulation. 
However, the presence of the interfaces separating the two phases yields an immensely 
complicated multi-boundary problem that is far from tractable even for relatively simple flows. 
Moreover, a local instantaneous description of a two-phase flow is far too detailed for practical 
analyses, where only the macroscopic, or average, transport of mass, momentum, and energy is of 
interest. Therefore, for practical analysis of two-phase flows, macroscopic balance equations for 
the mass, momentum, and energy for each phase have been established through proper averaging 
of the local instantaneous balance equations (Ishii, 1975; Drew and Passman, 1999).   
 
Ishii (1975) established the time-averaged two-fluid model, where the balances of mass, 
momentum, and energy of each phase are considered separately through two sets of averaged 
balance equations. In a two-phase flow, the phases are coupled through the interface. Therefore, 
interaction terms that describe the transport of mass, momentum, and energy between the phases 
naturally arise in the set of averaged balance equations. A simplified form of the two-fluid model 
that can be applied in most practical analyses is given as (Ishii and Mishima, 1984):

Equations [1-1], [1-2], and [1-3] describe the average balances of mass, momentum, and 
energy (enthalpy), respectively, within the kth-phase; k is set equal to f or g to denote the liquid or 
gas phase, respectively. 𝛼𝑘 is the void fraction of the kth-phase, which physically represents the 
volume of kth-phase per unit mixture volume. Alternatively, 𝛼𝑘 can be interpreted as the 
probability that a point is occupied by the kth-phase. 𝒗𝑘, 𝜌𝑘, 𝑝𝑘, 𝝉̿𝑘, 𝝉𝑘
𝑡, are the velocity, density, 
pressure, average viscous stress, and turbulent stress for the kth-phase, and 𝒈 represents the 
acceleration due to gravity. ℎ𝑘, 𝒒̿𝑘, 𝒒𝑘
𝑡, and 𝛷𝑘 are the enthalpy, conduction heat flux, turbulent 
heat flux, and energy dissipation for the kth-phase. 𝛤𝑘 and 𝑴𝑖𝑘 are the mass generation rate and 
generalized interfacial drag force for the kth-phase. The subscript i signifies the interface, and 
thus, the terms: 𝒗𝑘𝑖, ℎ𝑘𝑖, and 𝑞𝑘𝑖
′′  are the velocity, pressure, enthalpy, and heat flux of the kth-
phase at the interface. 𝝉𝑖 is the mean interfacial shear stress. As previously mentioned,  𝑎𝑖 is the 
interfacial area concentration, which physically represents the amount of interfacial surface area 
per unit mixture volume. 
In addition to the balance laws within each phase, the balance laws of the interface must 
also be satisfied. Thus, from an average of the local instantaneous jump conditions (interfacial 
balance laws), the following macroscopic jump conditions that constrain the interfacial transfer 
terms in Equations [1-1] through [1-3] are given as (Ishii, 1975; Ishii and Mishima, 1984):

[1-5] 
∑(ℎ𝑘𝑖𝛤𝑘+ 𝑎𝑖𝑞𝑘𝑖

[1-6]

Physically, Equation [1-4] indicates that mass is conserved across the interface; the mass 
generation process results in a loss from one phase and an equal gain by the other. Similarly, 
Equation [1-5] asserts that the interfacial surface forces that are represented by the generalized 
interfacial drag term (𝑴𝑖𝑘) are equal and opposite between the phases. Likewise, Equation [1-6] 
affirms conservation of energy between the phases across the interface.  
The two-fluid model average balance equations, Equations [1-1] through [1-3], are not 
closed by themselves. Constitutive equations are required to relate unknown quantities to the 
fundamental variables of choice. Drew and Lahey (1979) provide detailed discussion on both the 
formal and phenomenological approaches to developing the constitutive equations in the two-
fluid model. Extensive development of this topic is also presented by Ishii (1975), Drew and 
Passman (1999), and Ishii and Hibiki (2006). 
Since the two-fluid model treats each phase separately through two sets of balance 
equations, the two-fluid model can provide a detailed description of a wide range of two-phase 
flow phenomena compared to simpler mixture formulations such as the homogenous equilibrium 
model (Wallis, 1969) or drift-flux model (Zuber and Findlay, 1965; Ishii, 1975; Ishii, 1977). For 
this reason, the two-fluid model is the most accurate two-phase flow model for practical analyses, 
and it is utilized in many thermal-hydraulic systems analysis and computational fluid dynamics 
codes. Although the two-fluid model is a higher fidelity model, its accuracy is limited by the 
validity of the constitutive relations supplied to it. Specifically, in addition to the closure 
relationships that are required for single-phase flows, closure models are required for the 
interfacial transfer terms that account for the transfers of mass, momentum, and energy across the 
interface. These terms couple the balance equations for each phase together, so the accuracy of 
their specification is critical in the two-fluid model. Moreover, obtaining accurate closure for the 
interfacial area concentration is of particular importance because the interfacial area 
concentration provides information about the interfacial structure of the flow.

1.1.2 Importance of the Interfacial Area Concentration  
In the two-fluid model (Ishii, 1975), interaction terms appear in the field equations that 
couple the phases together through the transport of mass, momentum, and energy across the 
interface. Therefore, these terms are directly related to the interfacial area concentration.  For 
example, the standard drag force component of the generalized interfacial drag term written for 
the dispersed gas-phase (𝑴𝑖𝑔
𝐷) can be expressed as (Ishii and Mishima, 1984): 
𝑴𝑖𝑔
𝐷= −𝑎𝑖[𝐶𝐷
4 (𝑟𝑠𝑚
𝑟𝐷
) 𝜌𝑐𝒗𝑟|𝒗𝑟|
2
] 
[1-7] 
where, 𝐶𝐷 and 𝒗𝑟 are the drag coefficient and the relative velocity between the dispersed-gas and 
continuous-liquid phases, respectively. The ratio of the Sauter-mean radius (𝑟𝑠𝑚) to the drag 
radius (𝑟𝐷) represents a shape factor, which is one for spherical bubbles. Also, the mass 
generation rate can be written as (Ishii and Mishima, 1984): 
𝛤𝑘= 𝑎𝑖𝑚𝑘 
[1-8] 
where 𝑚𝑘 is the mass transfer per unit area for the kth-phase. With Equation [1-8], the interfacial 
energy transfer term can be written as (Ishii and Mishima, 1984):  
(ℎ𝑘𝑖𝛤𝑘+ 𝑎𝑖𝑞𝑘𝑖
′′ ) = 𝑎𝑖(ℎ𝑘𝑖𝑚𝑘+ 𝑞𝑘𝑖
′′ ) 
[1-9] 
In view of Equations [1-7] through [1-9], a general interfacial transfer term (𝐼𝐾) can be expressed 
as a product of the interfacial area concentration and a driving flux that describes the local 
transport mechanisms as (Ishii and Mishima, 1984): 

6 
 
𝐼𝐾 ~ 𝑎𝑖× 𝐷𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐹𝑙𝑢𝑥 
[1-10] 
 
The interfacial area concentration is an inverse length scale of the interface that describes 
the geometric capacity for interfacial transport. The transport of mass, momentum, and energy 
across the interface depends on the amount of surface area available for interaction between the 
phases. Thus, the transport characteristics vary as the interfacial structure changes. The interfacial 
area concentration is a fundamental geometric two-phase flow parameter that provides 
information about the configuration of the interfacial structure. Therefore, accurate specification 
of the interfacial area concentration is critical to the overall accuracy of the two-fluid model.  
Conventionally, the interfacial area concentration has been specified through algebraic, 
flow regime dependent correlations developed from limited ranges of experimental data (Ishii et 
al., 2009). A flow regime is a global (i.e. system scale) characterization of the two-phase flow 
interfacial structure that is often determined simply through flow visualization. Therefore, there is 
an inherent level of subjectivity in a flow regime-based description of two-phase flows. Delhaye 
and Bricard (1994) summarize several empirical correlations that relate the interfacial area 
concentration to global flow parameters, such as pressure drop and flow rates of the phases. 
While the interfacial area concentration is related to these parameters, it also strongly depends on 
system geometry as well as on the local void fraction (Ishii and Mishima, 1980). Thus, one 
cannot expect generality from correlations of global flow parameters, as was demonstrated in 
Delhaye and Bricard’s (1994) study. Based on geometric considerations, Ishii and Mishima 
(1980) developed expressions for the interfacial area concentration for assumed interfacial 
structures in bubbly, slug, churn-turbulent, and annular flow regimes Although Ishii and 
Mishima’s (1980) approach was more mechanistic, a priori knowledge of the flow regime is still 
required to select the appropriate expression for the interfacial area concentration. 

7 
 
In the flow regime-based approach, the flow regime is first identified based on static 
transition criteria. These criteria are often presented in the form of a flow regime map that defines 
flow regime boundaries in terms of global two-phase flow parameters such as the gas and liquid 
superficial velocities (Mishima and Ishii, 1984). Then, appropriate constitutive relations for the 
flow regime are selected to close the two-fluid model. This approach suffers from several aspects. 
First, the definition of a flow regime and its boundaries are inherently subjective. Physically, the 
development of the interfacial structure (i.e. flow regime transition) is a dynamic, continuous 
process that cannot be captured through fixed transition criteria. Flow regime transitions 
gradually occur in regions around these boundaries, and as such, an inherent level of uncertainty 
is introduced by relying on fixed transition criteria. Granted, for a specific system, one could 
develop a tailored flow regime map that would adequately describe the major flow regimes and 
transition regions. However, this approach would not be readily extensible to other systems since 
the interfacial structure is dependent on the flow duct geometry and upstream flow condition (e.g. 
inlet condition). These effects cannot be captured in general by a simple set of flow regime 
transition criteria. In addition to the deficiencies of the flow regime map, flow regime specific 
correlations can be discontinuous at the flow regime boundaries, which can lead to artificial 
bifurcations and numerical oscillations in simulations with the two-fluid model. Furthermore, 
numerical treatments that are used to smooth the transitions between different constitutive 
relations employed in each regime can cause uncertainty in calculations (Ishii et al., 2009). 
 
An alternative approach to the conventional flow regime-based methodology is to utilize 
a transport equation to specify the interfacial area concentration. Such an approach is more 
consistent with the two-fluid model because the interfacial area concentration can be treated as a 
dynamic variable that reflects the changes in the interfacial structure as the flow evolves. In view 
of this, a survey of the literature relevant to the development of the interfacial area transport 
equation as a constitutive model for the interfacial area concentration is performed in Section 1.2.

1.2 Literature Survey 
1.2.1 Interfacial Area Transport Equation  
Ishii (1975) first suggested that the interfacial area concentration in the two-fluid model 
should be specified through its own transport equation as: 
𝜕𝑎𝑖
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝑎𝑖𝒗𝑖) = 𝜙𝐿 
[1-11] 
where 𝒗𝑖 is the average interfacial velocity, and 𝜙𝐿 is a net source/sink term. 𝜙𝐿 accounts for 
various mechanisms that can change the interfacial structure and, consequently, the interfacial 
area concentration such as expansion/contraction, coalescence, or breakup of bubbles or droplets. 
Constitutive equations for 𝒗𝑖 and 𝜙𝐿 are required to be able to use Equation [1-11] to specify the 
interfacial area concentration in the two-fluid model. Numerous studies have sought to develop 
such a transport equation for the interfacial area concentration. The efforts can be broadly 
categorized into 1) derivation of the interfacial area transport equation and 2) development of 
constitutive models for various source/sink mechanisms. Efforts towards deriving the interfacial 
area transport equation are summarized in this Section. Previous works on model development for 
the source/sink mechanisms to the interfacial area concentration are discussed in Section 1.2.2. 
 
There exist two major approaches to deriving a transport equation for the interfacial area 
concentration. One approach is based on considering the evolution of an instantaneous geometric 
description of the interface in a two-phase flow. Through appropriate averaging of the 
instantaneous description of the interface, transport equations for the interfacial area 
concentration as well as other higher-order average two-phase flow geometric parameters such as 
the mean and Gaussian curvatures can be obtained (Drew, 1990; Drew and Passman, 1999; Morel 
et al., 1999; Morel, 2007; Liu, 2008; Liu et al., 2010). No assumption on the shape of the 

9 
 
interface is required in this approach, which allows for a completely general treatment of the 
interfacial structure throughout the entire range of two-phase flow regimes. However, as pointed 
out by Morel (1999), various terms that arise in the interfacial area transport equation derived in 
this way are difficult to relate to measureable two-phase flow quantities.   
 The second approach to deriving an interfacial area transport equation considers two-
phase flows that consist of dispersed fluid particles of one phase (i.e. bubbles or droplets) in a 
continuous region of the other phase. The fluid particles are characterized by one or more 
parameters such as volume, diameter, etc., and their population is described by a particle 
distribution function. The evolution of the particle distribution function is described by an 
equation similar to the classical Boltzmann transport equation, where the total change of the 
particle distribution function is balanced by various source/sink terms. The source/sink terms 
account for changes in the particle distribution function due to particle interactions (i.e. 
coalescence or breakup) and nucleation/collapse phenomena. A transport equation for the 
interfacial area concentration can be derived by weighting the particle distribution function 
transport equation by the particle surface area. Several studies have sought to develop an 
interfacial area transport equation following this approach (Kalkach-Navarro et al., 1994; 
Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii, 1995; Millies et al., 1996; Ishii and Kim, 2004; Yao and Morel, 
2004). In fact, most of the work on interfacial area transport has been based on interfacial area 
transport equations derived according to such a statistical approach. 
As pointed out by Liu et al. (2010), since the interfacial area transport equation obtained 
from the second method is based on the statistical characteristics of dispersed fluid particles, it 
cannot describe the interfacial area concentration of continuous-gas-liquid interfacial structures 
such as the gas-liquid-film interface in annular two-phase flow. From the standpoint of practical 
application, however, the equations derived from both methods effectively have the same form as 
Equation [1-11]. They contain unknown velocities and source/sink terms that require constitutive 

10 
 
models to be useful. Each approach can complement the other in identifying and developing the 
appropriate source/sink terms for various two-phase flow regimes. Since the present dissertation 
is concerned with the interfacial area transport equation in cap-bubbly transition two-phase flows, 
the second approach to deriving the interfacial area transport equation is considered exclusively 
in the remainder of this dissertation.  
The current state-of-the-art interfacial area transport equation is the two-group interfacial 
area transport equation developed by Ishii and Kim (2004) using the statistical approach 
analogous to the classical Boltzmann transport equation. In general dispersed-gas-continuous-
liquid two-phase flows, there exists a wide range of bubble sizes, and the bubble transport 
phenomena (e.g. bubble shape, bubble interaction mechanisms, interfacial forces, etc.) vary 
significantly with bubble size. Therefore, a multi-group interfacial area transport approach is 
required to treat a wide range of two-phase flow conditions. Currently, in view of differences in 
interfacial drag characteristics and major bubble interaction mechanisms, bubbles are categorized 
into two characteristic groups (Ishii and Kim, 2004). Group-I includes spherical and distorted 
bubbles, while group-II includes cap, slug, and churn-turbulent bubbles. The boundary between 
the two groups is defined by a critical bubble volume ( 𝑉𝑐) which can be specified through the 
maximum distorted bubble limit (𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥) given by Ishii and Zuber (1979) as: 
𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥= 4√
𝜎
𝑔Δ𝜌 
[1-12] 
Equation [1-12] is obtained by equating the drag coefficient correlations for distorted and cap 
bubbles given by Ishii and Zuber (1979), and 𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a volume equivalent diameter equal to 
approximately 10mm in air-water flows at ambient conditions. A schematic of the two-group 
bubble categorization scheme is shown in Figure 1-1.

where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote group-I and group-II parameters, respectively. The first and 
second terms on the left-hand sides of Equations [1-13] and [1-14] represent the local time rate of 
change and the advection, respectively, of the group interfacial area concentrations (𝑎𝑖1 and 𝑎𝑖2). 
The first terms on the right-hand sides are sources/sinks to the group interfacial area 
concentrations due to expansion/contraction of the bubbles in each group. The 
expansion/contraction of bubbles results from evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of 
existing bubbles in each group and changes in the mass density of the gas-phase. Likewise, the 
second terms on the right-hand sides represent intergroup transfer of interfacial area concentration 
between the groups due to expansion/contraction of bubbles across the group boundary. The non-

12 
 
dimensional parameter 𝐷𝑐1

⁄
 is a measure of the average size of group-I bubbles with 
respect to the critical bubble size at the group boundary (𝐷𝑐); 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 is the group-I Sauter-mean 
diameter. Additionally, the coefficient 𝜒 accounts for the amount of intergroup transfer between 
the two groups due to the expansion/contraction of bubbles across the group boundary.  The 𝜙𝑗,𝑘 
terms are the interfacial area concentration sources/sink rates to the kth-group due to the jth-type 
bubble interaction mechanism. The 𝜙𝑝ℎ,𝑘 terms represent the net interfacial area concentration 
source/sink to the kth-group due to nucleation/collapse phenomena. The derivation of both the 
one- and two-group interfacial area transport equations following the statistical approach 
analogous to the Boltzmann transport equation is revisited and discussed in detail in Chapter 2. 
The two-group interfacial area transport equations can be used to predict the interfacial 
area concentration in a wide range of two-phase flow conditions. In order to solve Equations [1-
13] and [1-14] for the group interfacial area concentrations, the velocities 𝒗𝑖1and 𝒗𝑖2 need to be 
specified. Moreover, closure models for the interfacial area concentration source/sink terms (𝜙𝑗,𝑘 
and 𝜙𝑝ℎ,𝑘) need to be developed. Developing models for the major bubble interaction 
mechanisms and nucleation/collapse phenomena that govern the evolution of the interfacial area 
concentration is the major challenge to closing the two-group interfacial area transport equation. 
This dissertation focuses on hydrodynamic effects (i.e. bubble interactions) in the two-
group interfacial area transport equations. Thus, available models for bubble interaction 
mechanism source/sink terms are discussed in Section 1.2.2. Regarding the nucleation/collapse 
source/sink terms, it is noted that there have been studies to develop source terms for wall 
nucleation (Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii, 1995) and sink terms due to bubble collapse (Park et 
al., 2007) in subcooled boiling flows. More recently, there have been significant experimental and 
theoretical efforts to develop one- and two-group interfacial area transport models for heated 
steam-water flows in a vertical annulus (Ozar, 2009; Brooks, 2014; Brooks et al., 2014).

1.2.2 Bubble Interaction Mechanism Source Term Models 
1.2.2.1 Major Two-Group Bubble Interaction Mechanisms  
Five major categories of bubble interaction mechanisms have been identified for two-
group interfacial area transport: 1) random-collision coalescence (RC), 2) wake-entrainment 
coalescence (WE), 3) turbulence-impact breakup (TI), 4) shearing-off (SO), and 5) surface-
instability breakup (SI) (Wu et al., 1998; Ishii et al., 2002). Random-collision coalescence is the 
coalescence of bubbles that are driven together by turbulent fluctuations in the liquid phase. 
Wake-entrainment coalescence occurs when a following bubble enters the wake region of a 
leading bubble, causing it to accelerate and coalesce with the leading bubble. Turbulence-impact 
breakup is the disintegration of bubbles due to impact by turbulent eddies in the liquid phase. 
Shearing-off is a disintegration process where numerous small bubbles are broken off from the 
rims at the bases of cap/slug bubbles. Lastly, when large bubbles are not restricted by the duct 
wall, they are cap-shaped and can grow due to coalescence interactions and expansion until a 
maximum size is reached. This maximum size is dictated by instability of the bubble interface 
(Batchelor, 1987; Kitscha and Kocamustafaogullari, 1989). Thus, the surface-instability breakup 
mechanism causes bubbles to break up once they reach the maximum size. This maximum size 
can be prescribed by the maximum stable cap bubble limit (𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥) which is given as (Kataoka 
and Ishii, 1987): 
𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥= 40√
𝜎
𝑔𝛥𝜌 
[1-15] 
For ambient air-water systems, Equation [1-15] yields a value of approximately 10cm. 
With two characteristic bubble groups, both intra- and intergroup bubble interactions are 
possible. Intragroup interactions are interactions where the interacting and resultant bubble(s) 

14 
 
reside within the same group, while intergroup interactions are interactions where the interacting 
and resultant bubble(s) reside in different groups. Figure 1-2 shows the nomenclature that is used 
to describe the intra- and intergroup source/sink terms in the two-group interfacial area transport 
equation (Ishii and Kim, 2004; Sun et al., 2004). For a general source/sink term (𝑋) a superscript 
in parentheses indicates the relationship between the interacting and resultant bubbles for a given 
mechanism. Subscripts indicate the bubble interaction mechanism and the group affected by the 
interaction.  For example, the superscript “(11,2)” indicates an intergroup interaction between two 
group-I bubbles that yields a group-II bubble. The subscript “WE,2” indicates that the interaction 
mechanism is wake-entrainment, and the term applies to the group-II equation.  
 
Figure 1-2: Two-group source/sink term nomenclature.  
For intragroup interactions, a shorthand version of the general notation is used since the 
interacting and resultant bubbles reside within the same group.  A single superscript number in 
parentheses is used to indicate the group in which the interaction is taking place, and a subscript 
indicating only the interaction mechanism is used.  For example, the general superscript “(2,22)” 
indicating an intragroup breakup interaction of a group-II bubble yielding two group-II bubbles is 
written more simply as “(2).” The nature of the interaction (i.e. breakup or coalescence) is then 
inferred from the interaction mechanism indicated in the subscript.

Table 1-1 summarizes the major intra- and intergroup bubble interaction mechanisms that 
have been identified for the two-group interfacial area transport equation, and Figure 1-3 shows 
schematics of the bubble interactions. For the intergroup interactions, it is important to note that 
the change in interfacial area concentration for one group is not the same for the other group due 
to the different bubble shapes in each group.  Thus, for a given intergroup interaction, say wake-
entrainment between two group-I bubbles to yield a group-II bubble, separate terms are required 
to express the change in interfacial area concentration for each group, namely 𝜙𝑊𝐸,1
(11,2) for the 
change in group-I and 𝜙𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) for the change in group-II.

1.2.2.2 One-Group Bubble Interaction Models 
If the flow of interest is a purely one-group flow (i.e. no group-II bubbles), the number of 
interaction terms reduces to just three (i.e. 𝜙𝑅𝐶
(1), 𝜙𝑊𝐸
(2), and  𝜙𝑇𝐼
(1)), and the two-group interfacial 
area transport equation reduces to the one-group interfacial area transport equation. Wu et al. 
(1998) and Kim (1999) developed mechanistic models for these three major one-group interaction 
mechanisms to establish the one-group interfacial area transport equation for vertical-upward 
bubbly flows. The resulting one-group interfacial area concentration source/sink terms are given 
as (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999):

The super- and subscript 1’s that indicate group-I have been excluded from the terms in 
Equations [1-16] through [1-17] since it is understood that only a one-group flow is under 
consideration. Considering the physics of these terms, the turbulence-impact mechanism is driven 
by the turbulent fluctuation velocity (𝑢𝑡). However, the inertia force due to the turbulent 
fluctuations must be sufficient to overcome the surface tension force to break up the bubble. 
Therefore, the bubble Weber number (𝑊𝑒) which is defined based on  𝑢𝑡, must be greater than 
the critical Weber number for breakup (𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟) in order for breakup to occur. Moreover, the larger 
𝑊𝑒 is compared to 𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟, there is a greater chance that breakup will occur. Random-collision 
coalescence is also drive by 𝑢𝑡, and the probability that two bubbles will collide increases with 
increasing void fraction towards the maximum packing void fraction (𝛼𝑚𝑎𝑥). Wake-entrainment 
coalescence is driven by the bubble relative velocity (𝑢𝑟). The wake region behind the leading 
bubble is related to the drag on the bubble. Therefore, the bubble drag coefficient (𝐶𝐷) arises in 
the wake-entrainment model.   
 
𝐶𝑇𝐼, 𝐶𝑅𝐶, 𝐶, and 𝐶𝑊𝐸 are empirical coefficients that capture stochastic effects of bubble 
interaction phenomena, such as coalescence efficiency, that would be difficult to characterize 
analytically in the context of a macroscopic two-phase flow model (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999). 
The coefficients have been established based on extensive experimental databases, which are 

18 
 
summarized in Section 1.2.3.2. Experimental conditions were selected to highlight certain 
mechanisms in order to determine the coefficients. High liquid flow rate conditions (i.e. high 𝑢𝑡) 
with low void fraction were selected to isolate the turbulence-impact mechanism and set its 
coefficient. Likewise, high liquid flow rate conditions with higher void fractions were selected to 
determine the random-collision coefficients. With decreasing liquid flow rate, the effects of the 
turbulence based mechanisms diminish. Therefore, lower liquid flow rate conditions were used to 
determine the wake-entrainment coefficient. Additional work was also performed to extend the 
applicability of the model to co-current vertical-downward bubbly two-phase flows (Ishii et al., 
2004). Table 1-2 shows the one-group model coefficients that were determined for co-current 
vertical-upward and vertical-downward two-phase flows in round pipes and co-current vertical-
upward two-phase flow in a confined duct. Evaluation of the one-group interfacial area transport 
equation against an extensive two-phase flow experimental database established in round pipes 
and a confined duct has shown that the interfacial area concentration can be predicted well, 
generally within ±20% of experimental data (Ishii et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2002; Ishii et al., 2009)

1.2.2.3 Two-Group Bubble Interaction Models 
 
In a two-group flow, the group-II bubble length scale can be comparable to the flow duct 
length scale. Therefore, the duct geometry will affect the two-group flow structure. Not only will 

19 
 
it affect the shape of group-II bubbles, but the bubble motion and major bubble interaction 
mechanisms will also be affected. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the effects of duct size 
when developing the two-group interfacial area transport equation.     
Sun (2001) developed a comprehensive set of two-group bubble interaction source term 
models following a systematic integral approach (Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii, 1995). Sun 
(2001) considered air-water two-phase flows in a confined duct. The cross-section of the duct had 
a width and depth of 200mm and 10mm, respectively. Due to the high aspect ratio of the duct 
cross-section, the group-II bubbles were sandwiched between the duct walls in the depth 
direction. However, the bubbles were unconstrained in the width direction since it was greater 
than the maximum stable cap bubble limit. Therefore, stable slug flows could not be established 
in the confined duct (Sun, 2001; Sun et al., 2004). Moreover, bubble motion was not restricted in 
the width direction, leading to consideration of all the interactions in Table 1-1 (Sun, 2001). 
In large diameter pipes (i.e. 𝐷ℎ≳𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥), such as coolant pipes in nuclear reactors 
and other industrial applications, bubbles can grow to the maximum cap bubble size. Therefore, 
stable slug flows cannot form because the large bubbles break up due to the surface-instability 
mechanism before they can fill the duct cross-section and elongate (Kataoka and Ishii, 1987). 
Thus, there can be significant recirculation and increased lateral movement of the bubbles, as they 
are less confined by the pipe wall in large diameter pipes (Smith, 2002). These three-dimensional 
effects present additional challenges in developing the already more complex two-group 
formulation. With these considerations, Smith (2002) developed two-group bubble interaction 
models applicable to large diameter pipes considering all of the possible interactions in Table 1-1.  
 
If the duct length scale is less than 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥, cap bubbles can grow and fill the duct 
cross-section. They can then elongate, and stable slug flows can form. Since the duct dimensions 
restrict the group-II flow structure, simplifying assumptions can be made about the major bubble 
interaction mechanisms in such moderate size ducts. Moderate size ducts are relevant to many 

20 
 
practical systems. For example, two-phase flow in a moderate diameter pipe may be comparable 
to the flow in a reactor subchannel, which is somewhat confined by the fuel rods, allowing for the 
formation of slug bubbles. 
 
Hibiki and Ishii (2000) developed a two-group interfacial area transport equation 
considering two-phase flows near the bubbly-slug flow regime transition boundary in a 5.08cm 
pipe. Since the pipe diameter was less than 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥, surface-instability breakup was neglected. 
Additionally, it was assumed that the shearing-off mechanism would be insignificant in bubbly-
slug transition flows. Random-collision interactions with group-II bubbles were excluded because 
the pipe size limits the lateral motion of the group-II bubbles. Additionally, intergroup 
coalescence interactions of group-I bubbles to form group-II bubbles were assumed to be unlikely 
for the flow conditions investigated. Likewise, the complete breakup of group-II bubbles into 
group-I bubbles was neglected. Also, intragroup wake-entrainment between group-I bubbles was 
not included in the model. With these simplifications, the source/sink terms considered in Hibiki 
and Ishii’s (2000) two-group model are shown in Table 1-3.

Because Hibiki and Ishii (2000) neglected intergroup coalescence interactions between 
group-I bubbles that form group-II bubbles, their model is limited to established two-group flows 
that already contain a significant amount of group-II bubbles. It cannot dynamically transition 

21 
 
from a purely one-group flow to a two-group flow because there is no mechanism to generate 
group-II bubbles from a purely one-group flow condition. Additionally, it is noted that only a 
double-sensor conductivity probe was used to acquire the measurements in the experimental 
database used in the development of Hibiki and Ishii’s (2000) two-group model. Since a double-
sensor probe can only measure the interfacial area concentration of near-spherical bubbles, it is 
questionable to use such a database for two-group model development. Furthermore, 𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥, 
Equation [1-12], was not used to define the boundary between group-I and group-II bubbles in 
that database. The group boundary was taken to be 20mm instead of 10mm. Therefore, the 
experimental data are skewed towards a larger group-II bubble size, such that the flows that were 
studied were more established group-II conditions.  
 
Fu (2001) also developed a two-group interfacial area transport model for moderate 
diameter (2.5cm ≤ D ≤ 10cm) round pipes. Considering the added complexity and difficulty of 
experimental verification of the bubble interactions in the two-group interfacial area transport 
equation, an assessment of the possible bubble interactions was performed in order to simplify the 
required terms according to their nature and degree of importance (Fu, 2001; Fu and Ishii, 2002a).  
From experimental observation, the wake-entrainment and shearing-off mechanisms were found 
to cause the majority of the intergroup bubble interactions.  Furthermore, intragroup wake-
entrainment was found to be the dominant sink to the number of group-II bubbles.  While this 
interaction constitutes a sink to group-II interfacial area concentration, it also influences the 
overall flow structure and hence, other bubble interactions.  Lastly, the disintegration of group-II 
bubbles was found to be enhanced by the high turbulence intensity and active eddy-bubble 
interaction in the wake region of slug bubbles (Fu, 2001). 
In addition to identifying these major bubble interactions, several simplifying 
assumptions were made in Fu’s assessment (Fu, 2001; Fu and Ishii, 2002a).  Due to the similar 
nature of the intergroup interactions between group-I and group-II bubbles that occur primarily in 

22 
 
the wake region of group-II bubbles, it was assumed that random-collision of group-I and group-
II bubbles can be accounted for by wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles.  
In relation to this assumption, the contribution from group-I bubbles interacting in the nose region 
of group-II bubbles was assumed to be negligible because of the lower group-I bubble number 
density (i.e. lower interaction frequency) and lower turbulence intensity in this region.  Random-
collision coalescence of group-II bubbles was assumed to be negligible since the interaction of 
group-II bubbles in moderate diameter pipes predominately occurs in the wake region of the 
leading bubbles. The intergroup turbulent disintegration of a group-II bubble into group-I bubbles 
was not addressed.  However, the turbulent disintegration of a group-II bubble into a group-I and 
group-II bubble was considered as part of the shearing-off effect.  Lastly, the disintegration of 
group-II bubbles at the maximum size due to surface-instability was considered negligible owing 
to the moderate pipe size (Fu, 2001; Fu and Ishii, 2002a). Table 1-4 summarizes the bubble 
interaction mechanisms in Fu’s (2001) two-group interfacial area transport model; additional 
details of this model are presented in Chapter 4.

Although Fu (2001) identified intragroup breakup of group-II bubbles due to turbulent 
disintegration as a major interaction mechanism and developed a model for it, this term was cited 
to be negligible and dropped from the formulation during the model assessment against 
experimental data (Fu 2001, Fu and Ishii, 2002b).  The existing one-group models (Wu et al., 
1998; Kim, 1999) for random-collision and wake-entrainment were generalized to account for 
intragroup and intergroup coalescence of group-I bubbles. Therefore, unlike Hibiki and Ishii’s 
(2000) model, Fu (2001) did consider intergroup mechanisms that can cause the transition from a 
purely one-group flow condition to a two-group flow condition.  However, these models have not 
been sufficiently assessed against experimental data.  
1.2.3 Experimental Studies 
 
Owing to the complexity of two-phase flows, one will likely always rely on some degree 
of phenomenological modeling to develop two-phase flow models that are useful in practical 
analyses. As such, reliable experimental databases are essential to two-phase flow model 
development. Over the past several decades, great advances have been made in the development 
of local two-phase flow instrumentation such as the local multi-sensor conductivity probe 
(Revankar and Ishii, 1993; Kim et al., 2000), the multi-sensor optical fiber probe (Le Corre et al., 
2003), and the wire-mesh sensor (Prasser et al., 1998). These tools have provided the capability to 
establish detailed experimental databases of local two-phase flow parameters, including the void 
fraction and interfacial area concentration. Since the local multi-sensor conductivity probe is used 
in this dissertation, background regarding its development and operation are discussed in Section 
1.2.3.1. 

24 
 
1.2.3.1 Local Multi-Sensor Conductivity Probe 
The local conductivity probe is one of the few two-phase flow measurement techniques 
capable of obtaining detailed measurements of local time-averaged two-phase flow parameters. A 
few of the seminal works with the conductivity probe include the pioneering work of Neal and 
Bankoff (1963) where a single-sensor probe was developed to obtain local void fraction 
measurements. Also, Serizawa et al. (1975) used a double-sensor conductivity probe to obtain 
local void fraction and bubble velocity measurements. Additionally, Kataoka et al. (1986) 
established methods to measure the local time-averaged interfacial area concentration with 
double- and four-sensor probes. Kim et al. (2000) developed a miniaturized four-sensor 
conductivity probe and signal processing scheme, allowing for measurements throughout a wide 
range of two-phase flow conditions. Extensive reviews of the conductivity probe and other local 
two-phase flow measurement techniques are available in the literature (Jones and Delhaye, 1976; 
Cartellier and Achard, 1991).  
The conductivity probe measurement principle is based on the inherent difference in the 
electrical conductivities of the gas and liquid phases in a two-phase flow. To demonstrate the 
measurement principle, consider a probe consisting of two needle-like sensors that are separated 
by a known distance (Δ𝑠) and are electrically insulated along their lengths except for their very 
tips. Figure 1-4(a) shows a schematic of such a double-sensor conductivity probe as a bubble 
passes through the sensors and the ideal sensor response. Figure 1-4(b) shows how a conductivity 
probe can be implemented into a two-phase flow system. A voltage (𝑉𝐷𝐶) is applied to the sensors 
which are connected to the grounded, metallic probe body through the surrounding conductive 
liquid. The voltage drop across the liquid from the kth-sensor to ground (𝑉𝑘) is measured with a 
data acquisition system (DAQ). When a sensor tip is in the liquid, the circuit is complete, yielding 
a baseline voltage signal. When a sensor tip is in the gas phase, however, the circuit is broken 

25 
 
owing to the much lower conductivity of the gas phase, yielding a high voltage signal. These 
characteristic signals contain information about the residence time of the gas phase at the sensor 
tips, and the time delay between the interfaces hitting the upstream and downstream sensors. 
As such, the voltage signal from a single-sensor conductivity probe can be used to 
measure the local time-averaged void fraction (𝛼̅𝑡) according to: 
𝛼̅𝑡= 1
𝑇∑Δ𝑡𝑔𝑗
𝑁𝑏
𝑗=1
 
[1-19] 
where 𝑇 is the measurement duration, 𝑁𝑏 is the number of bubbles that contact the upstream 
sensor, and  Δ𝑡𝑔𝑗 is the residence time of the jth bubble at the sensor tip, which would be the 
upstream sensor in a multi-sensor probe. With two sensors separated by an axial distance (Δ𝑠) in 
the direction of the flow, the average axial bubble velocity (𝑣̅𝑔) can be estimated as: 
𝑣̅𝑔=
1
𝑁𝑒𝑓𝑓
∑
Δ𝑠
Δ𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑗
𝑁𝑒𝑓𝑓
𝑗=1
 
[1-20] 
where Δ𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑗 is the time delay between the front interface of the jth bubble contacting the 
upstream and downstream sensors, and 𝑁𝑒𝑓𝑓 is the number of bubbles that register effective 
signals at both sensors. The time-averaged interfacial area concentration (𝑎̅𝑖
𝑡) is defined as (Ishii, 
1975; Kataoka et al., 1986): 
𝑎̅𝑖
𝑡= 1
𝑇∑(
1
|𝒗𝑖∙𝒏𝑖|)
𝑗
𝑁
𝑗=1
 
[1-21] 
where 𝒗𝑖 and 𝒏𝑖 are the interfacial velocity and interfacial unit normal vectors for the jth interface, 
and 𝑁 is the number of interfaces passing a point within the time interval 𝑇. Under certain 
statistical assumptions about 𝒗𝑖 and ni, the interfacial area concentration can be evaluated from 
the measured velocity obtained from a double-sensor probe (Kataoka et al., 1986; Wu and Ishii, 

26 
 
1999; Le Corre and Ishii, 2002). However, the double-sensor probe method is only applicable to 
bubbly flows where the bubbles can be regarded as approximately spherical in shape. More 
generally, the interfacial area concentration can be evaluated using a four-sensor conductivity 
probe (Kataoka et al., 1986). In comparison to the double-sensor probe depicted in Figure 1-4, a 
four-sensor probe has two additional downstream sensors. Thus, a four-sensor probe has three 
upstream-downstream sensor pairs from which three time delays can be measured. With these 
three measured time delays and the four-sensor conductivity probe geometry, the interfacial area 
concentration can be calculated without assuming a specific bubble shape (Kataoka et al., 1986; 
Tan and Ishii, 1990; Revankar and Ishii, 1993). In modern conductivity probe measurements, a 
data acquisition system is used to record the raw voltage signals from the sensors. Processing 
software is then used to condition the signals, pair the signals from the upstream and downstream 
sensors, and calculate the two-phase flow parameters.  
Owing to the complexity of two-phase flows and sensor-interface interactions with local 
probes, characterization of the uncertainties in measured two-phase flow parameters is a major 
challenge. Theoretical studies using Monte-Carlo analysis have been performed to study probe 
uncertainty and develop probe design criteria and correction factors which can be applied to 
measurements with double-sensor and four-sensor probes (Wu and Ishii, 1999; Le Corre and 
Ishii, 2002). Additionally, several experimental benchmarking studies have been undertaken that 
demonstrate the accuracy of the conductivity probe. The conductivity probe has been 
benchmarked against image analysis (Revankar and Ishii, 1993; Hibiki et al., 1998; Kim et al., 
2000), the optical fiber probe (Le Corre et al., 2003), and the wire mesh sensor (Manera et al., 
2009). These benchmark studies generally indicate ±10% agreement between the measured two-
phase flow parameters obtained with each method. However, few studies have been performed to 
systematically assess the effects of different components of a conductivity probe measurement 
system on the measured two-phase flow parameters.

1.2.3.2 Experimental Databases 
 
Table 1-5 summarizes some of the available experimental databases that can be used for 
interfacial area transport model development. The experimental databases include measurements 
of local time-averaged two-phase flow parameters including: the void fraction, interfacial area 
concentration, bubble velocity, and bubble Sauter-mean diameter obtained with conductivity 
probes. Kataoka (2010) and Lin and Hibiki (2014) provide substantial listings of additional 
experimental databases of local two-phase flow parameters for both adiabatic and heated flows.

1.3 Significance and Uniqueness of the Current Dissertation 
 
While there have been significant efforts to establish the interfacial area transport 
equation for purely one-group and established two-group flows, there has been no systematic 
study on the transition between the groups. This transition corresponds to the cap-bubbly flow 
regime, which, historically, has often been neglected in two-phase flow modeling. In order to 
fully realize the benefit of the two-group interfacial area transport equation as a constitutive 
model for the interfacial area concentration in the two-fluid model, it is paramount to consider the 
transition from bubbly flow to cap-bubbly flow. During this transition, group-I bubbles coalesce 
to form larger cap-shaped bubbles. Thus, the bubbly to cap-bubbly transition corresponds to the 
initiation of the transition from a one-group flow to a two-group flow. Robust models for the 
bubble interaction mechanisms that are responsible for the generation of group-II bubbles from 
group-I bubbles during the bubbly to cap-bubbly transition are essential to dynamically predicting 
the continuous progression from bubbly to cap-bubbly flows and through to more established 
two-group conditions such as slug and churn-turbulent flows. Therefore, the major unique 
objective of this dissertation is to develop interfacial area transport models to achieve a smooth 
transition from one-group to two-group flow conditions.  
 
In order to achieve this goal, an in-depth understanding of the two-group interfacial area 
transport formulation is required. Therefore, the one- and two-group interfacial area transport 
equations are derived in detail following the statistical approach in order to clearly establish the 
interfacial area transport equation framework applicable to bubbly, cap-bubbly, slug, and churn-
turbulent two-phase flows. A new approach is used in developing the constitutive models for the 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms in the interfacial area transport equations. It is identified 
that the existing expansion/contraction source/sink terms in the two-group interfacial area 
transport equations include the effects of intergroup particle interactions and intergroup 

30 
 
expansion/contraction. This causes these effects to be counted twice in the existing two-group 
interfacial area transport equations. Therefore, revised expansion/contraction source/sink terms 
are developed in this dissertation to correct this issue. This effort is a significant contribution to 
the research on interfacial area transport. 
 
While the available experimental database contains measurements in a wide range of 
two-phase flow conditions, the majority of the database exists either in purely one-group flows or 
two-group flows with a significant contribution of group-II bubbles (i.e. area-averaged group-II 
void fractions (〈𝛼2〉) greater than approximately 0.05). There are few conditions with low group-
II contribution, which are necessary to assess and develop models for the bubble interaction 
mechanisms responsible for transition between the groups. Therefore, to support assessment and 
development of the two-group interfacial area transport equation, an experimental database that 
highlights transition from one-group to two-group flows is required. The present dissertation 
establishes an experimental database of local two-phase flow parameters using the state-of-the-art 
four-sensor conductivity probe in vertical-upward air-water two-phase flows that highlights the 
transition from one-group to two-group flows.  
 
Additionally, investigations into several practical aspects of the conductivity probe 
measurement system are performed to improve the local conductivity probe measurement 
technique for two-phase flows. Specifically, the effects of signal “ghosting” electrical 
interference on the conductivity probe measurements are investigated experimentally with a novel 
conductivity probe design. Furthermore, the sensitivities of the measured two-phase flow 
parameters to sampling frequency, measurement duration, and orientation of the probe sensors are 
studied. Based on these studies, guidelines are provided to improve conductivity probe data 
acquisition.

Chapter 2
 
Formulation of the Interfacial Area Transport Equation:  
Derivation of New Expansion Source Terms 
The derivation of both the one-group and two-group interfacial area transport equations is 
revisited in this Chapter following an approach similar to Ishii and Kim (2004). The derivation of 
the equations is discussed in detail in order to clearly establish the interfacial area transport 
equation framework applicable to bubbly, cap-bubbly, slug, and churn-turbulent two-phase flows. 
Moreover, a new approach is used in developing the constitutive models for the expansion source 
terms in the interfacial area transport equations. The appropriate forms of the expansion source 
terms in the interfacial area transport equations are discussed in view of maintaining consistency 
with other interfacial area concentration source terms and with the two-fluid model. 
 
Before discussing the particle distribution function transport equation in Section 2.1 that 
forms the basis of the interfacial area transport equation, it is noted that the development in this 
Chapter is presented from the perspective of dispersed-gas bubbles in a continuous-liquid. Thus, 
the terms “particle” and “bubble” may be used interchangeably, and the nomenclature reflects 
that the gas-phase is under consideration. However, this choice of perspective does not detract 
from the generality of the approach to developing an interfacial area transport equation for other 
flows with dispersed, interacting fluid particles such as dispersed-liquid droplets continuous-gas. 
2.1 Particle Distribution Function Transport Equation  
 
Many gas-liquid two-phase flows consist of discrete fluid particles of one phase (e.g. gas 
bubbles or liquid droplets) that are dispersed throughout a continuous region of the other phase. 

33 
 
Physically, the interfacial area concentration is related to the surface area of the dispersed-phase 
particles. As such, the interfacial area concentration depends on the number of dispersed-phase 
particles and particle size, which can be characterized by the volume of a particle (𝑉). In view of 
this, the interfacial area transport equation can be formulated based on a transport equation for a 
particle distribution function, analogous to the classical Boltzmann transport equation. 
 
Define 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑉, 𝑡) to be the particle distribution function such that the quantity 
𝑓(𝒙, 𝑉, 𝑡)𝑑3𝑥𝑑𝑉 is the expected number of particles within a spatial volume 𝑑3𝑥 at position 𝒙 
that have particle volumes within 𝑑𝑉 of 𝑉 at time 𝑡. In other words, 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑉, 𝑡) is the number 
density that describes the expected number of particles per unit mixture and particle volume. 
Figure 2-1 schematically shows the physical space and particle volume space that are under 
consideration. The transport equation that describes how 𝑓(𝒙, 𝑉, 𝑡) evolves can be written as 
(Hulburt and Katz, 1964; Delhaye, 2001; Ishii and Kim, 2004): 
𝜕𝑓
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝑓𝒗) + 𝜕
𝜕𝑉(𝑓𝑉̇ ) = ∑𝑆𝑗
𝑗
+ 𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-1] 
 
Considering the left-hand side of Equation [2-1], the first term represents the local time 
rate of change of the particle distribution function. The second term accounts for the advection of 
the particle distribution function in physical space, where 𝒗= 𝒗(𝒙, 𝑉, 𝑡) is the average velocity of 
particles with volume 𝑉. The third term describes the flux of the particle distribution function 
through the particle volume space, where  𝑉̇ = 𝑉̇ (𝒙, 𝑉, 𝑡) is the time rate of change of particle 
volume following a particle. Physically, the third term represents the change in the particle 
distribution function due to the expansion/contraction of existing particles.  The 
expansion/contraction of existing particles can occur due to evaporation/condensation across the 
fluid particle interfaces and changes in the particle mass density. On the right-hand side of 
Equation [2-1], 𝑆𝑗 represents the particle source/sink rate per unit mixture and bubble volume due 

34 
 
to the jth-type particle interaction mechanism (i.e. breakup and/or coalescence). Lastly, 𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐 is the 
net source/sink rate due to nucleation/collapse phenomena, such as homogenous or heterogeneous 
nucleation in the bulk flow, nucleation at a heated wall, or flashing.  
 
In previous studies (Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii, 1995; Ishii and Kim, 2004), 𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐 was 
denoted as 𝑆𝑝ℎ, where “ph” indicated “phase change.” It is important to recognize that 𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐, or 
𝑆𝑝ℎ, only accounts for phase change phenomena that are responsible for the creation/destruction 
of particles. Evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of existing particles is distinct from 
nucleation/collapse phenomena since it does not involve the creation/destruction of particles. 
Evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of existing particles, resulting in their 
expansion/contraction, is already accounted for in the third term on the left-hand side of Equation 
[2-1]. In view of this, evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of existing particles and 
nucleation/collapse phenomena are identified as two distinct classes of phase change processes in 
the present work, and the subscript “nuc” is used instead of “ph” to clarify this point. The 
importance of this distinction will become more apparent later in this Chapter as the interfacial 
area transport equation is developed from Equation [2-1].

The particle distribution function transport equation is too detailed for use in practical 
analyses of two-phase flow where one is typically interested in the evolution of macroscopic two-
phase flow parameters such as the void fraction or interfacial area concentration. However, 
transport equations for such parameters can be derived from Equation [2-1] by averaging with 
respect to the particle volume. If the particle transport phenomena (e.g. particle shape, particle 
interaction mechanisms, interfacial forces, etc.) do not vary significantly with particle volume, 
then the particles can be regarded as a single group, and transport equations for the macroscopic 
two-phase flow parameters of interest can be obtained by averaging over the entire particle 
volume domain. Dispersed bubbly two-phase flow, where bubbles can be approximated as 
spherical in shape and are subject to similar interfacial forces and interaction mechanisms, is an 
example of a situation where a one-group formulation is appropriate. If there are substantial 
differences in the transport phenomena for particles of different sizes, however, then the particle 
volume domain must be discretized into an appropriate number of groups, and averaging must be 
performed over each group to derive a set of multi-group transport equations; this is addressed 
further in Section 2.3. In view of these considerations, one-group transport equations for three 
important two-phase flow parameters, the number density, void fraction, and interfacial area 
concentration, are developed in Section 2.2. 
2.2 One-Group Transport Equations 
Averaging Equation [2-1] to obtain one-group transport equations for two-phase flow 
parameters of interest involves multiplying Equation [2-1] by an appropriate weighting function 
and integrating over all particle volumes. In order to develop a concise framework to obtain 
transport equations for the quantities of interest, this process is first performed with an arbitrary 
weighting function to develop a general one-group transport equation in Section 2.2.1. A similar 

36 
 
approach has been used by Yao and Morel (2004). The general one-group transport equation is 
then used in the remainder of this Section to obtain one-group transport equations for the number 
density, void fraction, and interfacial area concentration.   
2.2.1 General One-Group Transport Equation 
 
Let the weighting function 𝜓= 𝜓(𝒙, 𝑉, 𝑡) be an arbitrary parameter that characterizes the 
dispersed-phase particles.  Multiplying Equation [2-1] by 𝜓 yields: 
𝜓𝜕𝑓
𝜕𝑡+ 𝜓∇⋅(𝑓𝒗) + 𝜓𝜕(𝑓𝑉̇ )
𝜕𝑉
= ∑𝜓𝑆𝑗
𝑗
+ 𝜓𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-2] 
Observe that by applying the chain rule of differentiation, the three terms on the left-hand side of 
Equation [2-2] can be written as: 
𝜓𝜕𝑓
𝜕𝑡= 𝜕(𝜓𝑓)
𝜕𝑡
−𝑓𝜕𝜓

[2-3] 
𝜓∇⋅(𝑓𝒗) = ∇⋅(𝜓𝑓𝒗) −𝑓𝒗⋅∇𝜓

𝜕𝑉

𝜕𝑉
−𝑓𝑉̇ 𝜕𝜓
𝜕𝑉

Combining Equations [2-2] through [2-5] yields: 
𝜕𝜓𝑓

𝜕𝑉

𝑑𝑡= ∑𝜓𝑆𝑗

[2-7] 
 
Now, integrating Equation [2-6] between the minimum and maximum particle volumes 
(𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥) one obtains:

In general, 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 can be regarded as functions of position and time. Applying the 
Leibnitz rule of integration to the first two terms on the left-hand side of Equation [2-8] yields:

[2-10] 
Assuming that 𝑓|𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛≈𝑓|𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥≈0, the third term on the left-hand side of Equation [2-8] and 
the last two terms in Equations [2-9] and [2-10] can be dropped. Dropping these terms and noting 
that the integration and summation operations in the first term on the right-hand side of Equation 
[2-8] commute, a general one-group transport equation can be written as:

[2-11] 
 
Through appropriate choice of 𝜓, the integral quantities in Equation [2-11] can be 
identified as average quantities with respect to particle volume. The integration effectively 

38 
 
removes the unnecessary detail about the dependence on particle volume that is contained in 
Equation [2-1]. Using the general one-group transport equation given by Equation [2-11], 
transport equations for the number density, void fraction, and interfacial area concentration are 
developed in Sections 2.2.2, 2.2.3, and 2.2.4, respectively.  
2.2.2 One-Group Number Density Transport Equation 
The one-group transport equation for the number density (𝑛), which is the expected 
number of particles per unit mixture volume, can be obtained by choosing 𝜓= 1 in Equation [2-
11]. The number density is defined as: 
𝑛(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝑓𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
 
[2-12] 
Also, the particle number weighted velocity (𝒗𝑛) is defined as: 
𝒗𝑛(𝒙, 𝑡) =

𝑓𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛

∫
𝑓𝒗𝑑𝑉

[2-13] 
Additionally, the number density source/sink rate due to the jth-type particle interaction 
mechanism (𝑅𝑗) and the net source/sink rate due to nucleation/collapse phenomena (𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑐) are 
defined, respectively, as: 
𝑅𝑗(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝑆𝑗
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉 
[2-14] 
𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑐(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉 
[2-15] 

39 
 
 
With the definitions given by Equations [2-12] through [2-15] and choosing 𝜓= 1 in 
Equation [2-11], the one-group number density transport equation is obtained as: 
𝜕𝑛
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝑛𝒗𝑛) = ∑𝑅𝑗
𝑗
+ 𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-16] 
Considering the left-hand side of Equation [2-16], the first and second terms account for the local 
time rate of change and the advection, respectively, of the number density. Observe that the third 
term in Equation [2-11] is zero when 𝜓 is chosen to be one, and consequently there is not a third 
term on the left-hand side of Equation [2-16]. As previously defined, the terms on the right-hand 
side are the source/sink rates to the number density due to the jth-type particle interaction 
mechanisms and the net source/sink rate due to nucleation/collapse phenomena. In order to solve 
Equation [2-16] for the number density, 𝒗𝑛 must be determined. Also, constitutive models for the 
source/sink terms are required. 
2.2.3 One-Group Void Transport Equation 
2.2.3.1 Development Using General One-Group Transport Equation 
 
The one-group transport equation for the void fraction (𝛼), the average particle volume 
per unit mixture volume, can be obtained by choosing 𝜓= 𝑉 in Equation [2-11]. First, as in 
Section 2.2.2, several definitions are made. The void fraction is defined as: 
𝛼(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝑉𝑓𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
 
[2-17] 
Also, the particle volume weighted velocity (𝒗𝑔), or the center-of-volume velocity of the gas-
phase, is defined as: 

40 
 
𝒗𝑔(𝒙, 𝑡) =
∫
𝑉𝑓𝒗𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
∫
𝑉𝑓𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
=
∫
𝑉𝑓𝒗𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝛼
 
[2-18] 
Recall that this Chapter is presented from the perspective of dispersed-gas bubbles in continuous 
liquid. Hence, the term void fraction, as is commonly done, implies the fraction of the gas-phase. 
Likewise, the subscript “𝑔” on 𝒗𝑔 indicates the gas-phase. 
 
The void fraction source/sink rate due to the jth-type particle interaction mechanism (𝜂𝑗) 
and the net source/sink rate due to nucleation/collapse phenomena (𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐) are defined, 
respectively, as: 
𝜂𝑗(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝑉𝑆𝑗
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉 
[2-19] 
𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝑉𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉 
[2-20] 
Note that particle interaction mechanisms (i.e. breakup and/or coalescence) are expected to 
conserve particle volume and, consequently, to not contribute to the one-group void transport 
equation. The source term(s) defined by Equation [2-19] are retained for completeness at this 
point and are discussed further in Section 2.2.3.2.  
 
With the definitions given by Equations [2-17] through [2-20] and choosing 𝜓= 𝑉 in 
Equation [2-11], one obtains the one-group void transport equation as: 
𝜕𝛼
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝛼𝒗𝑔) −∫
𝑓𝑉̇
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉= ∑𝜂𝑗
𝑗
+ 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-21] 

41 
 
 
The one-group void transport equation given by Equation [2-21] must agree with the gas-
phase continuity equation in the two-fluid model. In fact, the void transport equation cannot be 
considered as a separate, independent equation from the continuity equation in the set of 
governing equations. However, by demanding agreement between the void transport and 
continuity equations, one can develop constitutive relationships for 𝑉̇ , 𝜂𝑗, and 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 in Equation 
[2-21]. As can be seen in Section 2.2.4, a constitutive model for 𝑉̇  is required to obtain the 
interfacial area transport equation. As such, following a new approach, Equation [2-21] is 
combined with the gas-phase continuity equation in Section 2.2.3.2 to establish constitutive 
relationships for these terms.     
2.2.3.2 Development of Constitutive Model for 𝑽̇   
Recall that the gas-phase continuity equation is given as (Ishii, 1975): 
𝜕𝛼𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝑡
+ ∇⋅(𝛼𝜌𝑔𝒗𝑔) = 𝛤𝑔 
[2-22] 
By judiciously expanding the derivatives on the left-hand side of Equation [2-22] and 
rearranging, the continuity equation can be expressed as: 
𝜕𝛼
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝛼𝒗𝑔) = 𝛤𝑔
𝜌𝑔
−𝛼
𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑔𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑡 
[2-23] 
where the operator 𝐷𝑔𝐷𝑡
⁄
 is the substantial derivative based on the gas-phase velocity (Ishii, 
1975). In this form, the continuity equation expresses transport of the void fraction. The terms on 
the right-hand side of Equation [2-23] are void fraction sources/sinks due to mass transfer and 
compressibility of the gas-phase, respectively (Ishii, 1975). 

42 
 
 
Note that the total mass generation rate of the gas-phase (𝛤𝑔) includes both 
evaporation/condensation across existing interfaces and nucleation/collapse phenomena. These 
different processes can be explicitly accounted for by expressing 𝛤𝑔 as: 
𝛤𝑔= 𝛤𝑔,𝑖+ 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-24] 
𝛤𝑔,𝑖 is the net mass generation rate of the gas-phase due to evaporation/condensation across 
existing interfaces, as indicated by the subscript “i.” 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 is the net mass generation rate of the 
gas-phase due to nucleation/collapse phenomena, as indicated by the subscript “nuc.” As an aside, 
recall that the interfacial transfer condition on mass, Equation [1-4], requires that the total mass 
generation rate of the gas-phase must be equal and opposite to that of the liquid-phase. Therefore, 
it is also reasonable to require that corresponding mass generation rates for the liquid-phase (𝛤𝑓,𝑖 
and 𝛤𝑓,𝑛𝑢𝑐) be given as: 
𝛤𝑓,𝑖= −𝛤𝑔,𝑖 
[2-25] 
𝛤𝑓,𝑛𝑢𝑐= −𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-26] 
Thus, the total mass generation rate of the liquid-phase (𝛤𝑓) would be the sum of 𝛤𝑓,𝑖 and 𝛤𝑓,𝑛𝑢𝑐. 
 
Now having introduced these preliminaries regarding the continuity equation, observe 
that the right-hand side of Equation [2-23] can be substituted in for the first two terms on the left-
hand side of the one-group void transport equation, Equation [2-21]. Making the substitution and 
expressing 𝛤𝑔 as in Equation [2-24] yields: 
𝛤𝑔,𝑖
𝜌𝑔
+ 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐
𝜌𝑔
−𝛼
𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑔𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑡
= ∫
𝑓𝑉̇
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉+ ∑𝜂𝑗
𝑗
+ 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-27] 

43 
 
Note that the third term in Equation [2-21] has been moved to the right-hand side in Equation [2-
27]. In this way, the left-hand side of Equation [2-27] only contains terms that originated from the 
continuity equation, Equation [2-23], and the right-hand side of Equation [2-27] only contains 
terms that originated from the one-group void transport equation, Equation [2-21]. 
 
 Recognizing that the terms in Equation [2-27] correspond to distinct physical 
phenomena, one can compare the left- and right-hand sides of Equation [2-27] to infer 
constitutive relationships for the terms originating from the void transport equation. The left-hand 
side, which originated from the continuity equation, does not contain any terms that involve 
particle interaction mechanisms. However, the sum of the void fraction source/sink rates due to 
the jth-type particle interaction mechanisms from the void transport equation is present on the 
right-hand side. Therefore, Equation [2-27] implies that: 
∑𝜂𝑗
𝑗
= 0 
[2-28] 
As previously mentioned, particle volume is expected to be conserved during particle interactions 
(i.e. breakup and/or coalescence). In other words, the coalescence of two, or more, particles yields 
a particle with volume equal to the sum of the original particle volumes. Likewise, the breakup of 
a particle yields two, or more, particles with a combined volume equal to the volume of the 
original particle. In view of this, one can go further and postulate that each 𝜂𝑗 is separately equal 
to zero, too, not just their sum as suggested by Equation [2-28].  
 
In a similar manner, both the left- and right-hand sides of Equation [2-27] each contain a 
term associated specifically with nucleation/collapse phenomena. Therefore, one can infer that: 
𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐= 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐
𝜌𝑔
 
[2-29] 

44 
 
Equation [2-29] is a particularly important result because it demands that closure models chosen 
for 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 in the void transport equation must be consistent with those used for 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 in the 
continuity equation. Additionally, recall that Equation [2-20] defines 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 as an integral over 
𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐weighted by the particle volume. Therefore, Equation [2-29] places a similar consistency 
requirement between models for 𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐 and 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐. These consistency requirements also directly 
impact the terms associated with nucleation/collapse phenomena in the interfacial area transport 
equation, which are discussed in more detail in Section 2.2.4.3. 
 
Acknowledging the relationships given by Equations [2-28] and [2-29] and equating the 
remaining terms in Equation [2-27] yields:

Recall that 𝑉̇  accounts for the expansion/contraction of existing particles. The two terms on the 
right-hand side of Equation [2-30] show that this is due to mass generation across the interfaces 
of existing particles and change in the particle mass density, respectively. 
 
Now, rearranging the right-hand side of Equation [2-30] gives:

[2-31] 
Recall that the void fraction is defined by Equation [2-17] as an integral over the particle 
distribution function weighted by the particle volume. Substituting this definition for 𝛼 outside of 
the brackets in Equation [2-31] and noting that the terms inside of the brackets are not a function 
of particle volume such that they can be moved inside the integral yields:  
∫

Since the integrals in Equation [2-32] are over the same interval, they can be combined to give:

𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥

𝑑𝑉= 0 
[2-33] 
There are two cases that satisfy Equation [2-33]. One, the integrand can be negative for some 
bubble volumes and positive for others such that the integration from 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 exactly 
cancels, which is unphysical. Alternatively, the integrand can be zero for all bubble volumes 
between 𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 and 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥. The latter case is assumed, yielding: 
𝑓{𝑉̇ −𝑉[ 𝛤𝑔,𝑖
𝛼𝜌𝑔

𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑔𝜌𝑔

[2-34] 
Equation [2-34] can be solved for  𝑉̇  as: 
𝑉̇ = 𝑉

𝜌𝑔
−𝛼
𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑔𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑡] 
[2-35] 
Additionally, considering the continuity equation, Equation [2-23], and using the expressions for 
𝛤𝑔 and 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 given by Equations [2-24] and [2-29], respectively, Equation [2-35] can be recast as: 
𝑉̇ = 𝑉
𝛼[𝜕𝛼
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝛼𝒗𝑔) −𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐] 
[2-36] 
Equivalently, one could use Equation [2-35] to evaluate the integral term in the one-group void 
transport equation, Equation. [2-21]. Noting that the sum of the void source/sink terms due to 
particle interactions is zero, Equation [2-28], and combining the resulting void transport equation 
with Equation [2-35] also leads to Equation [2-36].  

46 
 
 
As previously discussed, Equation [2-35] shows that 𝑉̇  consists of contributions due to 
mass generation across the interfaces of existing particles and changes in the particle mass 
density. Equation [2-36] can provide a slightly different interpretation. The first two terms inside 
the brackets in Equation [2-36] represent the total change in void fraction. The void fraction 
source/sink due to nucleation/collapse phenomena (𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐) is subtracted from the total change in 
void fraction. This shows that 𝑉̇  is given by the change in void fraction excluding the change due 
to nucleation/collapse phenomena, which are responsible for the creation/destruction of particles.        
 
The expressions for 𝑉̇   presently obtained, Equations [2-35] and [2-36], are similar to 
those obtained by Ishii and Kim (2004) using a different approach based on a postulated particle 
mass balance. Regardless of the approach used, the void transport equation is used in conjunction 
with the continuity equation to develop constitutive relationships for the source terms in the void 
transport equation. The results obtained for 𝑉̇  are used to obtain the one-group interfacial area 
transport equation in Section 2.2.4.  
2.2.4 One-Group Interfacial Area Transport Equation 
2.2.4.1 Development Using General One-Group Transport Equation 
The one-group transport equation for the interfacial area concentration (𝑎𝑖), or average 
particle surface area per unit mixture volume, can be obtained by choosing 𝜓= 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) in 
Equation [2-11]. 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) is the average surface area of a particle with volume 𝑉. Thus, the 
interfacial area concentration is defined as: 
𝑎𝑖(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝐴𝑖(𝑉)𝑓𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
 
[2-37] 

47 
 
Also, the particle surface area weighted velocity (𝒗𝑖), or center-of-area velocity, is defined as: 
𝒗𝑖(𝒙, 𝑡) =
∫
𝐴𝑖(𝑉)𝑓𝒗𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛

𝐴𝑖(𝑉)𝑓𝑑𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
=
∫
𝐴𝑖(𝑉)𝑓𝒗𝑑𝑉

𝑎𝑖
 
[2-38] 
The interfacial area concentration source/sink rate due to the jth-type particle interaction 
mechanism (𝜙𝑗) and the net source/sink rate due to nucleation/collapse phenomena (𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐) are 
defined, respectively, as: 
𝜙𝑗(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝐴𝑖(𝑉)𝑆𝑗
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛

𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝐴𝑖(𝑉)𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐

𝑑𝑉 
[2-40] 
 
With the definitions given by Equations [2-37] through [2-40] and choosing 𝜓= 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) 
in Equation [2-11], one obtains: 
𝜕𝑎𝑖
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝑎𝑖𝒗𝑖) −∫
𝑓𝑑𝐴𝑖(𝑉)
𝑑𝑡
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉= ∑𝜙𝑗

[2-41] 
Furthermore, recalling Equation [2-7] and noting that 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) is only a function of the particle 
volume, 𝑑𝐴𝑖(𝑉) 𝑑𝑡
⁄
 in the third term in Equation [2-41] can be simplified to yield: 
𝜕𝑎𝑖

𝑓𝑉̇ 𝜕𝐴𝑖(𝑉)
𝜕𝑉
𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑑𝑉= ∑𝜙𝑗
𝑗
+ 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-42] 
 
Since 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) has not yet been specified, the development so far has not been restricted to 
a specific particle shape. Therefore, in this respect, Equation [2-42] can be considered as a 
general form of the one-group interfacial area transport equation. However, the third term in 
Equation [2-42] still explicitly contains the particle distribution function. This term is a 

48 
 
source/sink to the interfacial area concentration that accounts for the effect of particle 
expansion/contraction due to evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of existing particles 
and changes in the particle mass density. In order to obtain a useable form of the one-group 
interfacial area transport equation, this expansion/contraction source/sink term must be specified. 
Along with the constitutive model for 𝑉̇  that was developed in Section 2.2.3.2, a model for 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) 
is required to complete the specification of the expansion/contraction source/sink term. A model 
for 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) is presented in Section 2.2.4.2 that is used to complete the development of the one-
group interfacial area transport equation in Section 2.2.4.3. However, note that if a different 
model for 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) is desired, Equation [2-42] should be the starting point for developing the final 
form of the one-group interfacial area transport equation.  
2.2.4.2 Constitutive Model for 𝑨𝒊(𝑽) 
 
In the one-group approach, it is assumed that the average surface area of particles with 
volume 𝑉 can be described by the same function (i.e. 𝐴𝑖(𝑉)) for all sizes of particles; this loosely 
corresponds to assuming that all particles have the same shape. For dispersed-gas-continuous-
liquid two-phase flows, the one-group approach is most appropriate for bubbly two-phase flows 
where bubbles can be assumed to be approximately spherical for simplicity. Rather than directly 
assuming that the particles are spherical, however, one can follow Ishii and Kim’s (2004) 
approach to develop a model for  𝐴𝑖(𝑉) that can account for deviations from a spherical shape. 
For a particle of arbitrary shape with volume 𝑉 and surface area 𝐴𝑖, the volume equivalent (𝐷𝑒
𝑝), 
surface area equivalent (𝐷𝑠
𝑝), and Sauter-mean (𝐷𝑆𝑚
𝑝) diameters of the particle are defined as:

𝜑 represents the ratio of actual particle surface area to the surface area of a volume equivalent 
sphere; 𝜑 is equal to one for spherical particles. In view of Equations [2-43] through [2-46], one 
can show that: 
𝐴𝑖(𝑉) = (36𝜋)1 3
⁄ 𝜑𝑉2/3 
[2-47] 
Equation [2-47] provides a convenient way of expressing particle surface area as a function of 
particle volume where the effects of more complicated particle shapes can be introduced, if 
necessary, through appropriate models for 𝜑. This model for 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) is applied in Section 2.2.4.3 
to complete the development of the one-group interfacial area transport equation.  
2.2.4.3 Resulting One-Group Interfacial Area Transport Equation 
  
Following Ishii and Kim (2004), 𝜑 is presently assumed to be constant. Therefore, 
𝜕𝐴𝑖(𝑉) 𝜕𝑉

 in the expansion/contraction source/sink term in Equation [2-42] is given by: 
𝜕𝐴𝑖(𝑉)
𝜕𝑉
= 2

[2-48]

Using Equation [2-36] for 𝑉̇  and Equation [2-48] for 𝜕𝐴𝑖(𝑉) 𝜕𝑉
⁄
, the expansion/contraction 
source/sink term in Equation [2-42] can be evaluated as:

[2-49] 
Recognizing 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) in the integrand on right-hand side of Equation [2-49] and, consequently, that 
the integral is the interfacial area concentration as defined by Equation [2-37], one obtains:

[2-50] 
 
Interestingly, observe that 𝜑 has dropped out of the formulation of the 
expansion/contraction source/sink term in Equation [2-42]. This implies that the change in 
interfacial area concentration due to expansion/contraction is independent of the bubble shape. 
This is directly a consequence of the assumption that 𝜑 is constant. The expansion/contraction 
source/sink term will always have a prefactor of 2𝑎𝑖3𝛼
⁄
 regardless of the particle shape that is 
assumed as long as 𝜑 is constant. If 𝜑 does depend on particle volume, however, this will not be 
the case, and 𝜕𝐴𝑖(𝑉) 𝜕𝑉
⁄
 must be reevaluated to obtain the appropriate form of the 
expansion/contraction source/sink term.  
 
Also, observe that the prefactor 2𝑎𝑖3𝛼
⁄
 can be rearranged to be given as 4/𝐷𝑆𝑚. Here, 
𝐷𝑆𝑚 is the Sauter-mean diameter that is defined as:  
𝐷𝑆𝑚= 6𝛼
𝑎𝑖
  
[2-51] 
Therefore, the expansion/contraction source/sink term scales on the inverse of 𝐷𝑆𝑚 when 𝜑 is 
constant. Note that 𝐷𝑆𝑚 given by Equation [2-51] is defined in terms of macroscopic two-phase 
flow parameters, so it provides an effective bubble diameter that is representative of the bubble 

51 
 
size distribution. 𝐷𝑆𝑚 is distinct from 𝐷𝑆𝑚
𝑝 given by Equation [2-45], which is the Sauter-mean 
diameter of an individual particle.  
 
Note that even though 𝜑 has dropped out of the formulation of the expansion/contraction 
source/sink term, the introduction of 𝜑 is not wasted effort since the closure models for 𝜙𝑗 and 
𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐 also require a particle shape model. If needed, 𝜑 could be incorporated into the models for 
these terms. Moreover, the shape factor approach to specifying 𝐴𝑖(𝑉) is used in Section 2.3 in the 
development of the two-group interfacial area transport equations as a convenient way to 
introduce different shapes for the bubbles in each group.   
 
Using Equation [2-50] in Equation [2-42], the one-group interfacial area transport 
equation is obtained as: 
𝜕𝑎𝑖
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝑎𝑖𝒗𝑖) = 2
3 (𝑎𝑖
𝛼) [𝜕𝛼
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝛼𝒗𝑔) −𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐] + ∑𝜙𝑗

+ 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-52] 
The terms on the left-hand side of Equation [2-52] represent the local time rate of change and the 
advection of the interfacial area concentration, respectively. The first term on the right-hand side 
of Equation [2-52] is the interfacial area concentration source/sink due to the 
expansion/contraction of existing particles that results from evaporation/condensation and 
changes in the particle mass density. The last two terms are the interfacial area concentration 
sources/sinks due to the jth-type particle interaction mechanisms and nucleation/collapse 
phenomena, respectively. It is important to recall that the expansion/contraction source/sink term 
originated from the left-hand side of the particle distribution function transport equation, 
Equation [2-1]. It accounts for the effect of the change in volume of existing particles on the 
interfacial area concentration, which does not involve the creation/destruction of particles. 
Therefore, it is distinct from the last two terms, which can be regarded as “true” sources/sinks in 
the sense that they account for processes that do involve the creation/destruction of particles. In 

52 
 
order to solve Equation [2-52] for the interfacial area concentration, 𝒗𝑖 must be specified. 𝛼 and 
𝒗𝑔 can be obtained from the continuity and momentum equations in the two-fluid model. 
Moreover, constitutive models for the 𝜙𝑗’s and 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐 are required. 
The expansion/contraction source/sink term in Equation [2-52] is driven by the total 
change in void fraction excluding the change due to nucleation/collapse phenomena. Since the 
total change in void fraction would be determined from the solution of the two-fluid model field 
equations, it is imperative that the models for 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 and 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 agree as prescribed by Equation [2-
29]. If the model used for 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 in Equation [2-52] is inconsistent with that used for 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 in the 
two-fluid model field equations (i.e. violating Equation [2-29]), the change in void fraction due to 
nucleation/collapse phenomena would not be correctly excluded from the total change in void 
fraction. Consequently, the expansion/contraction source/sink term would incorrectly include the 
effects of nucleation/collapse phenomena on the interfacial area concentration, and the effects of 
existing particle expansion/contraction on the interfacial area concentration due to 
evaporation/condensation across existing interfaces and changes in the particle mass density 
would be misrepresented. Moreover, if 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 and 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 are inconsistent, the effects of 
nucleation/collapse on the interfacial area concentration would be included twice in Equation [2-
52]: once, incorrectly, in the expansion/contraction source/sink term and again in 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐, the 
correct source/sink term. As such, it is of utmost importance to ensure that Equation [2-29] is 
satisfied when developing source/sink term models and implementing the interfacial area 
transport equation given by Equation [2-52] with the two-fluid model.   
 
Additionally, the models for 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐 and 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 should also be consistent. Accounting for a 
phase change process in the model for 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐 and not including it in the model for 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐, or 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
for that matter, could lead to a similar situation where the effect of that process on the interfacial 
area concentration would be incorrectly included in both the expansion/contraction source/sink 

53 
 
term and in 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐. For illustrative purposes, consider adding an additional source term to the right-
hand side of Equation [2-52] that accounts for the change in interfacial area concentration due to 
evaporation/condensation of existing particles (𝜙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝). If 𝜙𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 is added to the right-hand side, a 
corresponding 𝜂𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑝 term that is analogous to 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 would have to be included in the existing 
expansion/contraction source term in order to prevent double-counting the effect of 
evaporation/condensation on the interfacial area concentration.   
 
To avoid the possibility of inconsistently specifying 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐, one can alternatively use 
Equation [2-35] for 𝑉̇  to evaluate the expansion/contraction source/sink term in Equation [2-42]. 
Then, the one-group interfacial area transport equation can be expressed in an equivalent form as: 
𝜕𝑎𝑖
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝑎𝑖𝒗𝑖) = 2
3 (𝑎𝑖

𝐷𝑔𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑡] + ∑𝜙𝑗
𝑗
+ 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-53] 
The form of the expansion/contraction source/sink term in Equation [2-53] may be less prone to 
error since 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 does not have to be specified. Furthermore, this form more explicitly shows the 
contributions to expansion/contraction due to evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of 
existing particles and changes in the particle mass density. However, other considerations, such as 
the effects on the numerical solution of the equation, should be evaluated when deciding whether 
to use the form of the expansion/contraction source/sink term given in Equation [2-52] or [2-53].  
 
The present development of the one-group interfacial area transport equation has 
provided valuable insight into the relationship among 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐, 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐, and 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 that must be 
considered to consistently develop models for the source/sink terms in the interfacial area 
transport equation and incorporate it with the two-fluid model. Having examined the development 
of the one-group interfacial area transport equation in detail, the motivation for a multi-group 
interfacial area transport approach and, specifically, the development of the two-group transport 
equations is considered in Section 2.3.   

54 
 
2.3 Two-Group Transport Equations 
In the one-group approach, Equation [2-1] is integrated over all particle volumes 
assuming that the particle transport phenomena are similar for all sizes of particles. In general 
dispersed-gas-continuous-liquid two-phase flows, the transport phenomena can vary significantly 
with bubble size. If there are substantial differences in the transport phenomena of different size 
particles, then the particle volume domain must be discretized into an appropriate number of 
groups, and averaging must be performed over each group to derive a set of multi-group transport 
equations. The appropriate number of groups must be chosen such that the important differences 
in the transport phenomena of different size particles are adequately captured while maintaining a 
manageable number of equations. Currently, in view of drag characteristics and major interaction 
mechanisms, bubbles are categorized into two groups (Ishii and Kim, 2004).  Group-I includes 
spherical and distorted bubbles, while group-II includes cap, slug, and churn-turbulent bubbles. 
The boundary between the groups is defined by a critical bubble volume (𝑉𝑐), which is assumed 
to be approximately constant within a given two-phase flow condition. 
 
Following the same approach used to develop the one-group transport equations, general 
two-group transport equations are first established in Section 2.3.1 to provide a concise 
framework for obtaining two-group transport equations for quantities of interest. Then, the 
general two-group transport equations are used in the remainder of this Section to obtain transport 
equations for the group number densities, void fractions, and interfacial area concentrations. 
2.3.1 General Two-Group Transport Equations 
Recall Equation [2-6] where the particle distribution function transport equation was 
multiplied by the arbitrary weighting function 𝜓. Instead of integrating Equation [2-6] over all 

55 
 
bubble volumes, one can integrate it separately over group-I bubble volumes (𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛 to 𝑉𝑐) and 
group-II bubble volumes (𝑉𝑐 to 𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥) to obtain:

[2-55] 
Note that in the one-group formulation, particles are characterized by similar transport 
phenomena; this corresponds to 𝜓 being the same function for all particle volumes. In the two-
group formulation, however, 𝜓 can be different for each group. This is reflected in Equations [2-
54] and [2-55] by the group subscript on 𝜓. Thus, 𝜓1 and 𝜓2 are the appropriate weighting 
functions that are valid within the group-I and group-II particle volume domains, respectively. 
 
Now, applying the Leibniz rule of integration and assuming that 𝑓|𝑉𝑚𝑖𝑛≈𝑓|𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥≈0, 
the general two-group transport equations are obtained as:

Note that the third terms on the left-hand sides of Equations [2-54] and [2-55] do not integrate to 
zero since the particle distribution function evaluated at the group boundary has not been assumed 
to be zero. Therefore, additional terms (i.e. ±(𝜓𝑘𝑓𝑉̇ )|𝑉𝑐) occur on the left-hand sides of 
Equations [2-56] and [2-57] that are not present in the general one-group transport equation, 
Equation [2-11]. These terms are intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms since they 
represent the transfer between the groups due to the expansion/contraction of existing particles 
that cause them to cross over the group boundary. As discussed in the one-group development, 
the expansion/contraction of existing particles can occur due to evaporation/condensation across 
the particle interfaces and changes in the particle mass density. By adding Equations [2-56] and 
[2-57], a total general transport equation can be obtained. The intergroup expansion/contraction 
source/sink terms should cancel each other in this total equation, which places restrictions on how 
the ±(𝜓𝑘𝑓𝑉̇ )|𝑉𝑐terms are specified. 
 
Similar to the one-group development, appropriate choice of 𝜓1 and 𝜓2 in Equations [2-
56] and [2-57] yields transport equations for average quantities of interest with respect to particle 
volume. Using the general two-group transport equations given by Equations [2-56] and [2-57], 
transport equations for the group number densities, void fractions, and interfacial area 
concentrations are developed in Sections 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4, respectively.  
2.3.2 Two-Group Number Density Transport Equations 
The two-group number density transport equations, can be obtained by choosing 𝜓1 = 1 
and 𝜓2 = 1 in Equations [2-56] and [2-57]. The group-I and group-II number densities (𝑛1 and 
𝑛2) are defined as: 

57

Additionally, the number density source/sink rates for group-I and group-II due to the jth-type 
particle interaction mechanism (𝑅𝑗,1 and 𝑅𝑗,2) are defined as:  
𝑅𝑗,1(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫

Likewise, the net number density source/sink rates for group-I and group-II due to 
nucleation/collapse phenomena (𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑐,1 and 𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑐,2) are defined as: 

58 
 
𝑅𝑛𝑢𝑐,1(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫

[2-65] 
 
With the definitions in Equations [2-58] through [2-65] and choosing 𝜓1 = 1 and 𝜓2 = 1  
in Equations [2-56] and [2-57], the two-group number density transport equations are obtained as: 
𝜕𝑛1

[2-67] 
The first and second terms on the left-hand sides of Equations [2-66] and [2-67] account for the 
local time rate of change and the advection, respectively, of the group number densities. The third 
terms account for transfer between the groups due to expansion/contraction of existing particles 
across the group boundary. This can result from evaporation/condensation across the particle 
interfaces and changes in the particle mass density. If Equations [2-66] and [2-67] are added 
together to obtain a total number density transport equation, the third terms do in fact cancel each 
other as previously mentioned. The terms on the right-hand sides are the source/sink rates to the 
group number densities due to particle interaction mechanisms and nucleation/collapse 
phenomena. The group velocities (𝒗𝑛1 and 𝒗𝑛2) are needed to solve Equations [2-66] and [2-67] 
for the group number densities. Also, the intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms 
must be specified; an approach to modeling these terms is discussed in Section 2.3.3.2. Lastly, 
constitutive models for the source/sink terms on the right-hand side are required.

2.3.3 Two-Group Void Transport Equations 
2.3.3.1 Development Using General Two-Group Transport Equations 
 
The two-group void transport equations can be obtained by choosing 𝜓1 = 𝑉 and 𝜓2 = 𝑉  
in Equations [2-56] and [2-57]. The group void fractions (𝛼1 and 𝛼2) are defined as: 
𝛼1(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫

The void fraction source/sink rates for each group due to the jth-type particle interaction

As discussed in the one-group development, particle interactions are expected to conserve particle 
volume. However, with a multi-group formulation, one must recognize that some particle 
interactions may lead to the transfer of void fraction between the groups. Therefore, one must 
distinguish between interactions that occur between particles within the same group (i.e. 
intragroup interactions) and interactions that occur between particles in different groups (i.e. 
intergroup interactions). Consequently, not all of the 𝜂𝑗,𝑘’s can be assumed to be independently 
zero as was done in the one-group formulation. This is discussed further in Section 2.3.3.2.  
 
The net void fraction source/sink rates due to nucleation/collapse phenomena for each 
group (𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,1 and 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,2) are defined as: 
𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,1(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫

With the definitions given by Equations [2-68] through [2-75] and choosing 𝜓1 = 𝑉 and 
𝜓2 = 𝑉 in Equations [2-56] and [2-57], one obtains the two-group void transport equations as:

Recall that the third terms must be equal and opposite so that they cancel when Equations [2-76] 
and [2-77] are added to obtain the total void transport equation. The specification of 𝑉̇  at the 
group boundary is discussed further in Section 2.3.3.2.    

61 
 
 
In the two-group approach, the two-fluid model must be extended to include gas-phase 
continuity equations for each bubble group (Ishii and Kim, 2004; Sun et al., 2003). The two-
group void transport equations given by Equations [2-76] and [2-77] must agree with the gas-
phase continuity equations for each bubble group. Additionally, the total void transport equation 
must agree with the total gas-phase continuity equation. As previously discussed in the one-group 
development, the void transport and gas-phase continuity equations cannot be considered as 
independent equations. Rather, the equations can be used in conjunction with each other to 
develop constitutive relationships. As such, following an approach similar to that used in the one-
group development, the two-group void transport and continuity equations are combined in 
Section 2.3.3.2. In particular, constitutive relations for 𝑉̇  are obtained, which are used to complete 
the two-group interfacial area transport equations in Section 2.3.4.3.  
2.3.3.2 Development of Constitutive Model for 𝑽̇  
To start, let us consider the gas-phase continuity equations that are required in the two-
fluid model with the two-group approach. Assuming that the mass density of the gas-phase is the 
same for each group, the gas-phase continuity equations for each group can be written as: 
𝜕𝛼1𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝑡
+ ∇⋅(𝛼1𝜌𝑔𝒗𝑔1) = 𝛤𝑔1 + 𝑚1 
[2-78] 
𝜕𝛼2𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝑡
+ ∇⋅(𝛼2𝜌𝑔𝒗𝑔2) = 𝛤𝑔2 + 𝑚2 
[2-79] 
where 𝛤𝑔1 and 𝛤𝑔2 are the total mass generation rates for group-I and group-II, respectively, due 
to phase change. Now with two bubble groups, there can be mass transfer between the groups due 
to intergroup particle interactions and expansion/contraction of particles across the group 

62 
 
boundary. Therefore, 𝑚1 and 𝑚2 are the net intergroup mass transfer rates for group-I and group-
II, respectively, that account for these effects. 
 
Adding the group continuity equations together must yield the total gas-phase continuity 
equation. The total gas-phase continuity equation, which is given by Equation [2-22], is repeated 
here for convenience: 
𝜕𝛼𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝑡
+ ∇⋅(𝛼𝜌𝑔𝒗𝑔) = 𝛤𝑔 
[2-22] 
In the two-group approach, the parameters in Equation [2-22] should be regarded as total 
parameters, that is, a combination of group-I and group-II parameters. The appropriate 
combinations are given by the following constitutive relationships that are required to obtain 
Equation [2-22] by adding Equations [2-78] and [2-79]: 
𝛼= 𝛼1 + 𝛼2 
[2-80] 
𝛤𝑔= 𝛤𝑔1 + 𝛤𝑔2 
[2-81] 
𝑚1 + 𝑚2 = 0 
[2-82] 
𝒗𝑔= 𝛼1𝒗𝑔1 + 𝛼2𝒗𝑔2
𝛼
 
[2-83] 
 
Equation [2-80] simply expresses that the total void fraction is equal to the sum of the 
group void fractions, which is a direct consequence of the continuity of the gas-phase. Likewise, 
Equation [2-81] indicates that the total mass generation rate of the gas-phase due to phase change 
is the sum of the total mass generation rates due to phase change for each group. Although mass 

63 
 
can transfer between the groups due to intergroup particle interactions and expansion/contraction 
of particles across the group boundary, these effects should not cause a change in the total mass 
of the gas-phase. Therefore, Equation [2-82] requires that the net intergroup mass transfer rates 
for each group (𝑚1 and 𝑚2) be equal and opposite to each other; this is analogous to the 
interfacial mass transfer condition between the gas and liquid phases, Equation [1-4]. Note that 
the form of total gas-phase velocity given by Equation [2-83] is based on the assumption that the 
mass density of the gas-phase is the same for each group and, hence, for the total gas-phase, too. 
 
It is noted that the two-group continuity equations are currently presented in a slightly 
different manner than in previous works on the two-group interfacial area transport equation 
(Ishii and Kim, 2004) and development of a modified two-fluid model to include additional 
balance equations for the two bubble groups (Sun et al., 2003; Ishii and Hibiki, 2006). In the 
previous works, a term Δ𝑚̇ 12 is defined as the intergroup mass transfer rate from group-I to 
group-II due to intergroup particle interactions and particle expansion/contraction across the 
group boundary, and intergroup mass transfer from group-I to group-II is defined to be positive. 
Therefore, Δ𝑚̇ 12 is subtracted from the right-hand side of the group-I continuity equation and 
added to the right-hand side of the group-II continuity equation in the previous works (Ishii and 
Kim, 2004; Sun et al., 2003; Ishii and Hibiki, 2006). In the present approach, distinct intergroup 
mass transfer terms (𝑚1 and 𝑚2) are included on the right-hand sides of their respective group 
continuity equation. Then, by demanding that the sum of the group continuity equations yields the 
total gas-phase continuity equation in order to guarantee conservation of mass of the gas-phase, a 
constitutive relationship between  𝑚1 and 𝑚2, Equation [2-82], is obtained. The present approach 
to the intergroup mass transfer rates is completely analogous to the specification of the mass 
generation rates due to phase change (𝛤𝑘) in the conventional two-fluid model (Ishii, 1975). 
 
As in the one-group development, evaporation/condensation across existing interfaces 
and nucleation/collapse phenomena can be identified as two distinct processes that may require 

64 
 
separate modeling considerations. Therefore, these different processes can be explicitly accounted 
for by expressing 𝛤𝑔1 and 𝛤𝑔2 as: 
𝛤𝑔1 = 𝛤𝑔1,𝑖+ 𝛤𝑔1,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-84] 
𝛤𝑔2 = 𝛤𝑔2,𝑖+ 𝛤𝑔2,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-85] 
where 𝛤𝑔1,𝑖 and 𝛤𝑔2,𝑖 are the net mass generation rates for group-I and group-II, respectively, due 
to evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of existing particles within each group. 
Likewise, 𝛤𝑔1,𝑛𝑢𝑐 and 𝛤𝑔2,𝑛𝑢𝑐 are the net mass generation rates for group-I and group-II, 
respectively, due to nucleation/collapse phenomena. Granted, direct nucleation/collapse of large 
group-II bubbles is physically unlikely to occur. However, a treatment may be required to account 
for the sudden creation/destruction of large bubbles if the time scale of the processes leading to 
their creation/destruction is small compared to the macroscopic time scale. Therefore, in the 
interest of maintaining generality, group-II nucleation/collapse source/sink terms are included 
throughout the present work.   
 
Recalling Equation [2-24], which is repeated below for convenience, the total mass 
generation rate of the gas-phase can be expressed in a similar manner: 
𝛤𝑔= 𝛤𝑔,𝑖+ 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-24] 
where 𝛤𝑔,𝑖 is the net mass generation rate of the gas-phase due to evaporation/condensation across 
existing interfaces, and 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 is the net mass generation rate of the gas-phase due to 
nucleation/collapse phenomena. In view of this and Equations [2-84] and [2-85], 𝛤𝑔,𝑖 and 𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
can be expressed in terms of the group mass generation rates as: 

65 
 
𝛤𝑔,𝑖= 𝛤𝑔1,𝑖+ 𝛤𝑔2,𝑖 
[2-86] 
𝛤𝑔,𝑛𝑢𝑐= 𝛤𝑔1,𝑛𝑢𝑐+ 𝛤𝑔2,𝑛𝑢𝑐 
[2-87] 
 
Lastly, in view of the interfacial mass transfer condition between the phases, Equation [1-
4], the corresponding mass generation rates for the liquid-phase can be written as: 
𝛤𝑓,𝑖= −(𝛤𝑔1,𝑖+ 𝛤𝑔2,𝑖) 
[2-88] 
𝛤𝑓,𝑛𝑢𝑐= −(𝛤𝑔1,𝑛𝑢𝑐+ 𝛤𝑔2,𝑛𝑢𝑐) 
[2-89] 
Again, the total mass generation rate of the liquid-phase (𝛤𝑓) would be the sum of 𝛤𝑓,𝑖 and 𝛤𝑓,𝑛𝑢𝑐. 
 
Having outlined the two-group continuity equation framework, one can now proceed to 
combining the group void transport and continuity equations. Just as in Section 2.2.3.2 of the one-
group development, the group continuity equations can be rearranged into a form that expresses 
the transport of the group void fractions: 
𝜕𝛼1
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝛼1𝒗𝑔1) = 𝛤𝑔1

𝜌𝑔

𝜌𝑔

𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑔2𝜌𝑔
𝐷𝑡 
[2-91] 
where the operator 𝐷𝑔𝑘𝐷𝑡
⁄
 is the substantial derivative based on the gas-phase velocity of the kth  
bubble group (Sun et al., 2003). In addition to sources/sinks to the group void fractions from mass 
generation due to phase change and gas-phase compressibility, the right-hand sides of Equations 
[2-90] and [2-91] contain source/sink terms due intergroup mass transfer the results from 
intergroup particle interactions and particle expansion/contraction across the group boundary. 

66 
 
 
Proceeding in a similar manner as in the one-group development, the group continuity 
equations, Equations [2-90] and [2-91], can be combined with the group void transport equations, 
Equations [2-76] and [2-77], to yield: 
𝛤𝑔1,𝑖

[2-93] 
Note that the terms originating from the group continuity equations and group void transport 
equations have been collected on the left- and right-hand sides, respectively, of Equations [2-92] 
and [2-93]. Also, 𝛤𝑔1 and 𝛤𝑔2 have been expressed using Equations [2-84] and [2-85]. Moreover, 
note that the void fraction source/sink terms due to particle interactions from the void transport 
equations (𝜂𝑗,𝑘)  have been separated explicitly into intra- and intergroup particle interaction 
source/sink terms (𝜂𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎 and 𝜂𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟).   
 
As in the one-group development, one can compare the left- and right-hand sides of 
Equations [2-92] and [2-93] to infer constitutive relationships among terms that correspond to 
distinct physical phenomena. Both sides of Equations [2-92] and [2-93] contain a term associated 
specifically with nucleation/collapse phenomena. Therefore, one can infer that: 
𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,1 = 𝛤𝑔1,𝑛𝑢𝑐
𝜌𝑔
 
[2-94] 
𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,2 = 𝛤𝑔2,𝑛𝑢𝑐
𝜌𝑔
 
[2-95] 

67 
 
Equations [2-94] and [2-95] demand consistency between models for  𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,𝑘 in the void transport 
equations and 𝛤𝑔𝑘,𝑛𝑢𝑐 in the continuity equations. The impact of this result on the consistency of 
terms associated with nucleation/collapse phenomena in the two-group interfacial area transport 
equations is completely analogous to what was discussed at length in the one-group development.   
 
There are no terms on the left-hand sides of Equations [2-92] and [2-93] that involve 
intragroup particle interaction mechanisms. Therefore, Equations [2-92] and [2-93] imply that: 
∑𝜂𝑗,1
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎
𝑗
= 0 
[2-96] 
∑𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎
𝑗
= 0 
[2-97] 
Since particle volume is expected to be conserved during particle interactions, it is reasonable that 
intragroup interactions do not act as sources/sinks to the group void fractions. Again, one can go 
further and postulate that each 𝜂𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎 are separately equal to zero, too, not just their sums as 
suggested by Equations [2-96] and [2-97].  
 
Unlike in the one-group development, the left-hand sides of Equations [2-92] and [2-93], 
which originated from the group continuity equations, now contain the net intergroup mass 
transfer rates (𝑚1 and 𝑚2) that account for mass transfer between the groups due to intergroup 
particle interactions and particle expansion/contraction across the group boundary. The first terms 
on the right-hand sides of Equations [2-92] and [2-93] account for the effect of particle 
expansion/contraction across the group boundary in the void transport equations. Also, the effect 
of intergroup particle interactions in the void transport equations is obviously accounted for by 
the intergroup void fraction source/sink terms (i.e. 𝜂𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟). Thus, equating these corresponding 
terms from the left- and right-hand sides yields:  

68 
 
𝑚1
𝜌𝑔
= −(𝑉𝑓𝑉̇ )|𝑉𝑐+ ∑𝜂𝑗,1

[2-98] 
𝑚2
𝜌𝑔
= (𝑉𝑓𝑉̇ )|𝑉𝑐+ ∑𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟
𝑗
 
[2-99] 
Note that in view of Equation [2-82], Equations [2-98] and [2-99] imply that: 
∑𝜂𝑗,1
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟
𝑗
+ ∑𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟
𝑗
= 0 
[2-100] 
Equation [2-100] indicates that intergroup interactions conserve the total void fraction; the 
amount of void fraction that is lost/gained from one group due to intergroup interactions is equal 
to the amount gained/lost by the other group. Since particle interactions are expected to conserve 
particle volume, it is reasonable to extend this result to hold for each individual intergroup 
interaction mechanism separately as well such that: 
𝜂𝑗,1
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟+ 𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟= 0 
[2-101] 
Equations [2-98] and [2-99] also provide constitutive relationships for 𝑚1 and 𝑚2 in the group 
continuity equations. These are developed further at the end of this Section after models for 𝑉̇  and 
𝑓|𝑉𝑐  are established.   
 
Acknowledging the relationships given by Equations [2-94] through [2-99] and equating 
the remaining terms in Equations [2-92] and [2-93] yields:

[2-103] 

69 
 
𝑉̇  accounts for the expansion/contraction of existing particles. Equations [2-102] and [2-103] 
show that this is due to mass generation across the interfaces of existing particles and changes in 
the particle mass density within each group. 
 
Recall from Equations [2-68] and [2-69] that the group void fractions are defined as 
integrals over the particle distribution function weighted by the particle volume. Substituting 
these definitions for 𝛼1 and 𝛼2 outside of the brackets on the right-hand sides of Equations [2-
102] and [2-103] and noting that the terms inside of the brackets are not a function of particle 
volume such that they can be moved inside the integrals, one can write: 
∫

[2-105] 
As discussed in the one-group development, it is assumed that the integrands in Equations [2-
104] and [2-105] are equal to zero, which gives: 
𝑓{𝑉̇ −𝑉[ 𝛤𝑔1,𝑖

[2-107] 
Thus, equations [2-106] and [2-107] can be solved for 𝑉̇  to yield: 
𝑉̇ =

[2-108] 

70 
 
Additionally, considering the group continuity equations, Equations [2-90] and [2-91], and using 
the expressions for 𝛤𝑔1, 𝛤𝑔2, 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,1, and 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,2 given by Equations [2-84], [2-85], [2-94], and [2-
95], respectively, Equation [2-108] can be recast as: 
𝑉̇ =

[𝜕𝛼2

𝜌𝑔
]    ,   𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑉𝑐< 𝑉≤𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
 
[2-109] 
As previously discussed, Equation [2-108] shows that 𝑉̇  consists of contributions due to 
mass generation across the interfaces of existing particles and changes in the particle mass density 
within each group. Equivalently, Equation [2-109] shows that 𝑉̇   is related to the change in the 
group void fractions excluding the changes due to nucleation/collapse phenomena and intergroup 
transfer. As mentioned in the one-group development, nucleation/collapse phenomena are 
responsible for the creation/destruction of particles. Likewise, intergroup transfer can be regarded 
as the creation/destruction, or perhaps more correctly the addition/removal, of particles within a 
group.  𝑉̇  is the rate of change of volume of existing particles. Therefore, processes that 
create/destroy particles should not contribute to 𝑉̇ .  
 
Note that in view of furnishing the intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms, 
Equations [2-108] and [2-109] express 𝑉̇ |𝑉𝑐in terms of group-I parameters, which is consistent 
with Ishii and Kim’s (2004) study. The physical basis for this choice is that many two-phase flow 
conditions of practical interest, such as boiling two-phase flows in energy systems, will evolve 
from a purely one-group flow into a two-group flow. Therefore, it is likely that group-I bubbles 
will be present in the flow before group-II bubbles, so the transfer at the group boundary can be 
best described based on group-I parameters. This choice for 𝑉̇ |𝑉𝑐 does not prevent transfer back to 
group-I from group-II, however, as long as group-I bubbles are present in the flow. Alternatively, 

71 
 
one could consider assigning 𝑉̇ |𝑉𝑐 as a combination of the expressions valid in each group, such 
as the arithmetic mean (Fu, 2001). However, the complexity of the model for 𝑉̇ |𝑉𝑐 should be 
considered in regards to practical implementation and its relative importance in the equations.  
 
A model for the particle distribution function evaluated at the group boundary (𝑓|𝑉𝑐) is 
also required complete the intergroup transfer terms due to particle expansion/contraction across 
the group boundary. Currently, the model proposed by Ishii and Kim (2004) is used. Considering 
a simplified representation of the particle volume distribution function, Ishii and Kim (2004) 
specified the product (𝑉𝑓)|𝑉𝑐 as: 
(𝑉𝑓)|𝑉𝑐= 𝜒𝑛1 
[2-110] 
where 𝜒 is the intergroup expansion/contraction transfer coefficient that describes the shape of the 
particle volume distribution. The choice of specifying (𝑉𝑓)|𝑉𝑐 in terms of the group-I number 
density is again based on the physical consideration that there will be a natural progression from 
one-group to two-group flows.  
 
Observe that the group-I number density can be specified as: 
𝑛1 = 𝛼1
𝑉̅1
 
[2-111] 
𝑛1 = 𝑎𝑖1
𝐴̅𝑖1
   
[2-112] 
where 𝑉̅1 and 𝐴̅𝑖1 are the average group-I bubble volume and surface area, respectively. Equations 
[2-111] and [2-112] allow the group-I number density to be expressed in terms of either 𝛼1 or 𝑎𝑖1, 
parameters that would be available from the solution of the two-fluid model with the interfacial 
area transport equation. Appropriate models for 𝑉̅1 or 𝐴̅𝑖1 in terms of available parameters, 
however, are still required to complete the specification. For now, 𝑉̅1 and 𝐴̅𝑖1 are retained 
unspecified in the remainder of this development in the interest of maintaining generality.  

72 
 
 
With models for 𝑉̇ |𝑉𝑐 and (𝑉𝑓)|𝑉𝑐, the intergroup transfer terms due to particle 
expansion/contraction across the group boundary can be specified, allowing us to complete the 
expressions for the intergroup mass transfer rates. Using Equations [2-108], [2-110], and [2-111] 
the intergroup mass transfer rates given by Equations [2-98] and [2-99] can be written as:  
𝑚1 = 𝜌𝑔{∑𝜂𝑗,1
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟
𝑗
−𝜒𝑉𝑐

𝑉̅1
[𝛤𝑔1,𝑖
𝜌𝑔
−𝛼1
𝜌𝑔

𝐷𝑡]} 
[2-114] 
If Equation [2-109] is used for 𝑉̇ |𝑉𝑐 instead of Equation [2-108], one can also write the intergroup 
mass transfer rates as: 
𝑚1 =
𝜌𝑔
1 −𝜒𝑉𝑐

𝑗
+ 𝜒𝑉𝑐
𝑉̅1
[𝜕𝛼1
𝜕𝑡+ ∇⋅(𝛼1𝒗𝑔1) −𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,1]} 
[2-116] 
 
Observe that the factor (1 −𝜒𝑉𝑐𝑉̅1
⁄
)−1 in Equations [2-115] and [2-116] has a vertical 
asymptote at 𝜒𝑉𝑐𝑉̅1
⁄
= 1. For 𝜒𝑉𝑐𝑉̅1
⁄
< 1 the factor is positive, while for 𝜒𝑉𝑐𝑉̅1
⁄
> 1 the factor 
is negative. The factor should be constrained to remain positive. Otherwise, if the factor is 
allowed to be negative, it will change the signs of the terms in the intergroup mass transfer rates. 
Physically, the intergroup particle interaction terms must have a particular sign. For example, 
considering transfers from group-I to group-II as positive, 𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 should be positive for the jth-
type intergroup interaction mechanism leading to transfer from group-I to group-II. Likewise, 
𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 should be negative for the jth-type intergroup interaction mechanism leading to transfer 
from group-II to group-I.  Note that the 𝜂𝑗,1
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 are equal and opposite to the corresponding 𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 

73 
 
according to Equation [2-101]. If the factor is not constrained to be positive it can change the sign 
of the particle interaction source/sink terms, which is not physical. In order for the factor to 
remain positive and finite, 𝜒𝑉𝑐𝑉̅1
⁄
 must satisfy: 
0 ≤𝜒𝑉𝑐
𝑉̅1
< 1 
[2-117] 
Furthermore, Equation [2-117] can be rearranged as 0 ≤𝜒< 𝑉̅1 𝑉𝑐
⁄
. Since 𝑉̅1 𝑉𝑐
⁄
 < 1, the bounds 
on 𝜒  suggested by Equation [2-117] are more restrictive than those proposed by Ishii and Kim 
(2004) (i.e. 0 ≤𝜒< 2). 
The effect of expansion/contraction of particles across the group boundary on the 
intergroup mass and void transfer is difficult to analyze and model since it requires knowledge of 
the particle volume distribution function, which is not readily attainable. If it can be argued that 
the particle volume distribution is approximately zero near the group boundary, the contribution 
from intergroup transfer to due to expansion/contraction can be neglected, which corresponds to 
setting 𝜒=0. In this case, the intergroup mass transfer is only due to intergroup particle 
interactions.  Likewise, as can be seen in Section 2.3.4.3, with 𝜒= 0, the intergroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms are removed from the two-group interfacial area 
transport equations, leaving only intergroup particle interaction mechanisms to transfer interfacial 
area concentration between the groups.  
 
To conclude this Section, observe that by substituting Equations [2-115] and [2-116] for 
𝑚1 and 𝑚2 in Equation [2-109], the following additional form of 𝑉̇  can be obtained:

 [2-118]

This additional form of 𝑉̇  is used in Section 2.3.4.3 to obtain a form of the two-group interfacial 
area transport equations where the expansion/contraction source/sink terms are expressed in terms 
of the changes in the group void fractions excluding the effects of nucleation/collapse phenomena 
and intergroup transfer. This form facilitates comparison to the two-group interfacial area 
transport equations given by Ishii and Kim (2004).  
2.3.3.3 Comparison of 𝑽̇ and 𝒎𝒌 to Previous Work 
 
Let us take a moment to compare the models presently obtained for 𝑉̇ , Equations [2-108] 
and [2-109], to those given by Ishii and Kim (2004). Using their nomenclature, Ishii and Kim

The group subscripts on 𝑉̇ /𝑉  in Equations [2-119] through [2-122] indicate for which group the 
expression is applicable. Equations [2-119] and [2-121] apply for group-I bubble volumes, and 
Equations [2-120] and [2-122] apply for group-II bubble volumes.

Ishii and Kim (2004) assume that the nucleated bubble size is much smaller than that at 
the group boundary. As such, they drop all source terms associated with group-II 
nucleation/collapse phenomena in their development. Hence, 𝜂𝑝ℎ,2 is not present in Equations [2-
120] and [2-122], and 𝜂𝑝ℎ refers to the group-I nucleation/collapse source/sink term, which is 
equivalent to 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐,1 in the present nomenclature. Dropping the group-II source terms associated 
with nucleation/collapse phenomena is reasonable for many two-phase flow conditions. However, 
in the interest of generality, these terms are retained throughout the present development.   
 When Equation [2-119] is rearranged, it can be shown to contain the quantity 𝛤𝑔1 −
𝜌𝑔𝜂𝑝ℎ. This quantity is the mass generation rate of group-I due to phase change excluding 
nucleation/collapse phenomena, which is the same as 𝛤𝑔1,𝑖 in the present derivation. Likewise, 
under the assumption that 𝜂𝑝ℎ,2 is negligible, 𝛤𝑔2 in Equation [2-120] is equal to 𝛤𝑔2,𝑖 in the 
present derivation. The derivatives of the mass density of the gas-phase in Equations [2-119] and 
[2-120] should be interpreted as substantial derivatives based on the gas-phase velocity of the 
corresponding bubble group. Therefore, these terms are the same as those in the present 
derivation. In view of these observations, one can rewrite Equations [2-119] and [2-120] using the 
present nomenclature as:

Comparing Equations [2-123] and [2-124], which are based on Ishii and Kim’s (2004) 
development, with Equation [2-108] from the present derivation, it is observed that the models for 
𝑉̇1/𝑉1 and 𝑉̇2/𝑉2 proposed by Ishii and Kim (2004) contain additional terms (i.e. ∓Δ𝑚̇ 12 𝛼𝑘𝜌𝑔
⁄
)

that include the effects of intergroup transfer. As argued above, 𝑉̇  describes the rate of change of 
volume of existing particles. This can occur due to evaporation/condensation across the interfaces 
of existing particles and changes in the particle mass density. Intergroup transfer includes the 
effects of intergroup particle interactions and particle expansion/contraction across the group 
boundary, which effectively create/destroy particles within a given group. Therefore, the effects 
of intergroup transfer should not be included in the model for 𝑉̇ . Excluding the effects of 
intergroup transfer from 𝑉̇   is similar to excluding the effects of nucleation/collapse phenomena. 
 
This point can be seen more directly by comparing Equations [2-121] and [2-122] 
proposed by Ishii and Kim (2004) with Equation [2-109] obtained in the present derivation. In the 
present derivation, the changes in group void fraction due to nucleation/collapse phenomena and 
intergroup transfer are subtracted from the total change in group void fraction. This leaves the 
change in group void fraction due to evaporation/condensation and changes in the gas-phase mass 
density to drive 𝑉̇ . While the effects of nucleation/collapse phenomena are removed (or assumed 
negligible in the case of group-II) in Ishii and Kim’s (2004) models, the change due to intergroup 
transfer is not. Therefore, the change in the group void fraction due to intergroup transfer is 
contributing to 𝑉̇  in Ishii and Kim’s (2004) expressions. This finding has a direct impact on the 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms in the two-group interfacial area transport equations, 
which is discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.4.3.  
 
It is also instructive to compare the intergroup mass transfer rates presently obtained, 
Equations [2-115] and [2-116], to the intergroup mass transfer rate (Δ𝑚̇ 12) that is given in the 
previous studies as (Sun et al. 2003; Ishii and Hibiki, 2006):

where 𝐷𝑐 is the critical bubble diameter at the group boundary, and 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 is the group-I Sauter-
mean diameter that is defined, analogous to Equation [2-51], as 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 = 6𝛼1/𝑎𝑖1. If transfer from 
group-I to group-II is considered as positive as in the previous studies (Ishii and Kim, 2004; Sun 
et al. 2003; Ishii and Hibiki, 2006), 𝑚2 in the current notation corresponds to the same quantity as 
Δ𝑚̇ 12. Thus, comparing Equations [2-116] and [2-125] it is observed that: 
𝑚2 =

Therefore, the presently derived intergroup mass transfer rates are the same as Δ𝑚̇ 12 from the 
previous studies except for an additional factor, (1 −𝜒𝑉𝑐𝑉̅1

an additional effect of the particle volume distribution on the intergroup mass transfer rate that 
was not identified in the previous studies (Sun et al. 2003; Ishii and Hibiki, 2006).  
2.3.4 Two-Group Interfacial Area Transport Equations 
2.3.4.1 Development Using General Two-Group Transport Equations 
The two-group transport equations for the group interfacial area concentrations (𝑎𝑖1 and 
𝑎𝑖2) can be obtained by choosing 𝜓1 = 𝐴𝑖1(𝑉) and 𝜓2 = 𝐴𝑖2(𝑉)in Equations [2-56] and [2-57]. 
𝐴𝑖1(𝑉) is the average surface area of a particle with volume 𝑉 in group-I. Likewise, 𝐴𝑖2(𝑉) is the 

78 
 
average surface area of a particle with volume 𝑉 in group-II. Thus, the group interfacial area 
concentrations are defined as: 
𝑎𝑖1(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫

[2-128]

Also, the particle surface area weighted velocities (𝒗𝑖1 and 𝒗𝑖2) are defined as:

The interfacial area concentration source/sink rates due to the jth-type particle interaction 
mechanism for each group (𝜙𝑗,1 and 𝜙𝑗,2) are defined as: 
𝜙𝑗,1(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝐴𝑖1(𝑉)𝑆𝑗

𝜙𝑗,2(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫

[2-133] 
Note that the 𝜙𝑗,𝑘 can be intra- or intergroup interactions (i.e. 𝜙𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎 and 𝜙𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟). Unlike in the 
void transport and continuity equations, however, where intergroup particle interactions conserve 

79 
 
volume and mass, the magnitudes of intergroup sources/sinks to the interfacial area concentration 
in each group are not the same since the particle shapes are different in each group.  
 
The net source/sink rates due to nucleation/collapse phenomena for each group (𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐,1 
and 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐,2) are defined as: 
𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐,1(𝒙, 𝑡) = ∫
𝐴𝑖1(𝑉)𝑆𝑛𝑢𝑐

With the definitions given by Equations [2-128] through [2-135] and choosing 𝜓1 =
𝐴𝑖1(𝑉) and 𝜓2 = 𝐴𝑖2(𝑉) in Equations [2-56] and [2-57], one can obtain:

Since 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) has not yet been specified, the development so far has not been restricted to 
a specific particle shape. Therefore, in this respect, Equations [2-136] and [2-137] can be 
considered as a general form of the two-group interfacial area transport equations. However, the 
third and fourth terms on the left-hand sides of Equations [2-136] and [2-137] still explicitly 
contain the particle distribution function. The third terms are intergroup expansion/contraction 
source/sink terms due to evaporation/condensation across existing interfaces and changes in the 
particle mass density that cause particles to cross over the group boundary, leading to transfer of 

80 
 
interfacial area concentration between the groups. The fourth terms are intragroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms due to evaporation/condensation across existing 
interfaces and changes in the particle mass density that account for the effect of 
expansion/contraction of particles that remain within their respective group.  In order to obtain a 
useable form of the two-group interfacial area transport equations these inter- and intragroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms must be specified. Along with the constitutive model for 
𝑉̇  that was developed in Section 2.3.3.2, a model for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) is required to complete the 
specification of these terms. A general approach to expressing particle surface area as a function 
of particle volume using a shape factor was presented in Section 2.2.4.2. This approach is utilized 
in Section 2.3.4.2 to specify 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) for assumed group-I and group-II bubble shapes. These 
results are then used to complete the development of the two-group interfacial area transport 
equations in Section 2.3.4.3. However, note that if a different model for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) is desired, 
Equations [2-136] and [2-137] should be the starting point for developing the final form of the 
two-group interfacial area transport equations.  
2.3.4.2 Constitutive Model for 𝑨𝒊𝒌(𝑽) 
Before discussing the models for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) for some assumed bubble shapes, it is necessary 
to examine some geometric scaling considerations of two-phase flows. In a two-phase flow, it is 
important to consider how various bubble length scales compare to other characteristic lengths of 
the flow. For example, in confined two-phase flows it is important to consider bubble length 
scales with respect to the length scale(s) of the duct cross-section. If the bubble length scales are 
comparable to the length scale(s) of the duct, the bubble shapes and interaction mechanisms can 
be affected. Therefore, these scale effects must be characterized so that they can be accounted for 
in the two-group interfacial area transport approach.   

81 
 
 
Two important bubble length scales in the two-group approach are the maximum 
distorted bubble diameter and the maximum cap bubble diameter given by Equations [1-12] and 
[1-15], which are repeated here for convenience: 
𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥= 4√
𝜎
𝑔Δ𝜌 
[1-12] 
𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥= 40√
𝜎
𝑔Δ𝜌 
[1-15] 
𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a bubble length scale that characterizes when the bubble shape, uninfluenced by wall 
effects, changes from distorted to cap-shaped. This corresponds to a change in the bubble’s 
interfacial drag characteristics (Ishii and Zuber, 1979). Once a cap bubble reaches a certain size, 
instability of the interface leads to its breakup into smaller cap bubbles. 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥 characterizes 
this maximum cap bubble size at which breakup occurs (Kataoka and Ishii, 1987; Kitscha and 
Kocamustafaogullari, 1989; Brooks et al., 2012). When uninfluenced by wall effects, 𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 can 
be considered as the length scale characterizing the boundary between group-I and group-II 
bubbles, while 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥 characterizes the maximum group-II bubble size. Many factors including 
the complex shapes of actual bubbles, influence of surrounding bubbles, wall effects, liquid phase 
turbulence, fluid impurities, etc. govern bubble size in a two-phase flow and cannot be captured 
by simple expressions like Equations [1-12] and [1-15]. Therefore, 𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥 should 
not be regarded as hard set criteria, but rather as approximate length scales that provide estimates 
of when to expect the change in bubble shape from distorted to cap and the maximum cap bubble 
size, respectively. It is clear that the relationship between these bubble length scales and the duct 
length scale will govern the two-group flow structure.  

82 
 
Let us define 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡 as the length scale of the duct cross-section that dictates the two-
group flow structure. For many flow ducts, 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡 can be considered as the duct hydraulic 
diameter. However, for duct cross-sections with a large aspect ratio, the largest dimension of the 
cross-section may be a more appropriate duct length scale, since bubbles can grow to fill that 
dimension. For comparison, it is convenient to non-dimensionalize 𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥, 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥, and 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡 
by the Laplace length (𝐿𝑎= √𝜎𝑔Δ𝜌
⁄
) yielding: 
𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥

With these parameters, one can identify three duct size categories, large, moderate, and 
small sized ducts, that must be considered when modeling the group-II bubble shape and two-
group interaction mechanisms. In large size ducts, a “dispersed two-group” flow structure exists 
where group-II bubbles of all sizes are relatively unaffected, at least in one direction in the cross-
section, by the duct walls. Consequently, the group-II bubbles are cap-shaped and the two-group 
bubble interaction mechanisms are not restricted by the duct walls. This dispersed two-group flow 
structure occurs during the transition from a one-group to a two-group flow where group-II 
bubbles are created. It also persists into more established two-group flows as group-II bubbles 

83 
 
continue to grow in size. The maximum group-II bubble size without wall effects is determined 
by the stability of the cap bubble interface that is characterized by 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥
∗
. Therefore, ducts 
with 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡
∗
 greater than approximately 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥
∗
 can be defined as large size ducts. 
 
In a moderate size duct, 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡
∗
 is large enough such that a dispersed two-group flow 
structure can occur during the transition from a one-group to a two-group flow. Since 𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥
∗
 
characterizes the smallest group-II bubble size without wall effects, a lower bound on 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡
∗
 for 
moderate size ducts can be chosen as approximately 2𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥
∗
. With this criterion, the wall effects 
on the group-II bubble shape can be assumed to be minimal such that group-II bubbles can be 
assumed to be cap-shaped during transition. Additionally, this criterion allows for group-II 
bubbles to be distributed in the cross-section. As group-II bubbles continue to grow in a moderate 
size duct, however, they will become comparable to 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡
∗
 and, consequently, influenced by the 
duct walls. This leads to a “confined two-group” flow structure in established two-group flows in 
moderate size ducts where the duct walls strongly influence the shape of the group-II bubbles and 
constrain the two-group bubble interactions. The group-II bubbles will fill the duct cross-section 
and elongate to form slug bubbles in an established two-group flow in moderate size ducts. Thus 
stable slug flows can occur in moderate size ducts, but not in large size ducts since group-II 
bubbles will break up before they can fill the duct cross-section and elongate. Therefore, the 
upper bound on 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡
∗
 for moderate size ducts is approximately 𝐷𝑐𝑎𝑝,𝑚𝑎𝑥
∗
. 
 
Lastly, a duct with 𝐿𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡
∗
 less than approximately 2𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥
∗
 can be classified as a small 
size duct. In small size ducts, a dispersed two-group flow structure cannot exist. Group-II bubbles 
are strongly influenced by the duct walls, and as such a confined two-group flow structure will 
exist during group-transition and in established two-group flows. In fact, if the duct size is small 
enough, cap-shaped bubbles may not even form during group transition; elongated group-II 
bubbles that fill the cross-section will form directly. The interactions for group-II bubbles, and 

84 
 
even group-I bubbles if the duct size is small enough, are geometrically constrained by the duct 
walls to be primarily along the axial direction of the flow in a small size duct. 
 
Table 2-1 summarizes the different duct size categories. The reader is cautioned that the 
bounds on these categories are only provided as a rough guide to introduce the effect of duct 
geometry in the two-group approach. Many factors will influence these bounds, which should be 
refined using experimental data.

With these considerations, models for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) can now be discussed. Recalling Equation 
[2-47], 𝐴𝑖1(𝑉) and 𝐴𝑖2(𝑉) can be written as: 
𝐴𝑖1(𝑉) = (36𝜋)1 3
⁄ 𝜑1𝑉2/3 
[2-141] 
𝐴𝑖2(𝑉) = (36𝜋)1/3𝜑2𝑉2/3 
[2-142] 
where 𝜑1 and 𝜑2 are the shape factors for group-I and group-II bubbles, respectively, defined 
according to Equation [2-46]. For now, the only assumption that will be made regarding the 

85 
 
group-I bubble shape is that 𝜑1 is constant. This assumption is slightly less restrictive than 
directly assuming that the group-I bubbles are spherical (i.e. 𝜑1 = 1), as is done in the previous 
work on the two-group interfacial area transport equation (Ishii and Kim, 2004; Sun et al., 2004; 
Fu and Ishii, 2002a). Retaining 𝜑1 as a constant in the formulation provides for the option to 
account later on for the effect of deviations from a spherical shape if necessary. A consequence of 
assuming that 𝜑1 is constant is that it drops out of the group-I intragroup expansion/contraction 
source/sink term in Equation [2-136], and the resulting prefactor on that term is 
2𝑎𝑖1 3𝛼1 = 4/𝐷𝑆𝑚1
⁄
. Thus, the group-I intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term scales 
on the inverse of 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 when 𝜑1 is constant.    
 
As discussed above, group-II bubbles in dispersed two-group flows will be cap-shaped. 
For many moderate and large size ducts, the group-II bubble shape in dispersed two-group flows 
can be approximated as a spherical-cap. Figure 2-2(a) schematically shows the side view a 
spherical-cap bubble. The aspect ratio of a spherical-cap (𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝) can be defined as the ratio of its 
height (ℎ) to its base-width (2𝑎). It can be shown that 𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝 can be expressed as a function of only 
the wake angle (𝜃) as: 
𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝= ℎ
2𝑎= 1 −cos(𝜃)
2 sin(𝜃)     ,   𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝜃≤90° 
[2-143] 
Also, it can be shown that the shape factor for a spherical-cap (𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝), defined according to 
Equation [2-46], is also only a function of the wake angle given by: 
𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝=
3 + cos (𝜃)
[4(1 −cos(𝜃))(2 + cos(𝜃))2]1/3 
[2-144] 

86

(b) 
Figure 2-2: Approximate group-II bubble shapes: (a) spherical-cap bubble and (b) slug bubble. 
 
Although the wake angle does depend on the Reynolds number of the cap bubble (Clift et 
al., 1978), which is a function of the cap bubble’s volume equivalent diameter and consequently 
the cap bubble’s volume, it rapidly approaches a nearly constant value of 50° for bubble 
Reynolds numbers greater than about a 100.  Table 2-2 compares the bubble Reynolds number 
based on the maximum distorted bubble diameter (𝑅𝑒𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥), which corresponds to the minimum 
cap bubble size, for ambient air-water and saturated steam-water conditions. The saturated steam-
water conditions are selected based on the nominal primary side pressures for typical pressurized 
water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear power plants (Todreas and 
Kazimi, 2012). Also, the bubble terminal rise velocity in an infinite medium is used as the 
relevant bubble velocity scale to evaluate the bubble Reynolds number. For each of these 
conditions, the bubble Reynolds number is on the order of 1000. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
assume that the wake angle and consequently 𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝 and 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝 are constant for many two-phase 
flow conditions of interest in experimental and practical systems.

In view of assuming that 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝 is a constant, if 𝜑2 = 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝, 𝜑2 drops out of the 
specification of the group-II intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term in Equation [2-
137]. The resulting prefactor on that term is 2𝑎𝑖2 3𝛼2 = 4/𝐷𝑆𝑚2
⁄
, where 𝐷𝑆𝑚2 is the group-II 
Sauter-mean diameter that is defined, analogous to Equation [2-51], as 𝐷𝑆𝑚2 = 6𝛼2/𝑎𝑖2. 
Therefore, when 𝜑2 = 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝, or any constant for that matter, the group-II intragroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink term scales on the inverse of 𝐷𝑆𝑚2. 
 
Since this dissertation considers two-group flows in moderate diameter round pipes, a 
model for the group-II bubble shape in confined two-group flow (i.e. a slug bubble shape) is also 
presently considered. Similar to Ishii and Mishima (1980) and Fu and Ishii (2002a), an idealized 
slug bubble can be approximated as having a spherical-cap-shaped nose and a cylindrical body 
with a base diameter 𝐷𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔= 𝜆𝐷ℎ. The factor 𝜆, which is less than one, represents the ratio of the 
slug bubble base diameter to the duct hydraulic diameter. The slug bubble base diameter is a 
fraction of the duct hydraulic diameter owing to the liquid film around the slug bubble. For the 
assumed slug bubble shape, the base-width of the spherical-cap-shaped nose is equal to 𝜆𝐷ℎ. 
Therefore, the height of the spherical-cap-shaped nose is equal to 𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝𝜆𝐷ℎ, where 𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝 is given 
by Equation [2-143] . The overall length of the slug bubble, which can be expressed as a function 

88 
 
of its volume, is denoted as 𝐿𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔. Figure 2-2(b) shows the side view of the assumed slug bubble 
shape. The shape factor for the assumed slug bubble shape (𝜑𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔) is given as: 
𝜑𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔= 24𝑉−𝜋𝜆3𝐷ℎ

[2-145] 
Notice that 𝜑𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔 is a function of the bubble volume. Therefore, if 𝜑2 = 𝜑𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔, 𝜑2 does not drop 
out of the specification of the group-II intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term in 
Equation [2-137]. Consequently, one can show for the assumed slug bubble shape that the 
prefactor on that term is 4 𝜆𝐷ℎ
⁄
 instead of 2𝑎𝑖2 3𝛼2
⁄
. Therefore, for the assumed slug bubble 
shape, the group-II intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term scales on the inverse of 
slug bubble base diameter (i.e.  (𝜆𝐷ℎ)−1) instead of the inverse of 𝐷𝑆𝑚2. 
 
In view of the assumed slug bubble shape, the prefactor on the group-II intragroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink term can differ from 2𝑎𝑖2 3𝛼2
⁄
 if 𝜑2 is not constant. Previous 
studies have modified the group-II intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term to account 
for the effect of different group-II bubble shapes (Fu and Ishii, 2002a; Ozar, 2009). Since the 
group-II bubble shape can be influenced by the duct geometry, the form of the group-II 
intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term can vary depending on the duct geometry 
and/or the assumed group-II bubble shape. To generalize this, consider a generic group-II bubble 
shape factor that is a function of bubble volume (i.e. 𝜑2 = 𝜑2(𝑉)). Also, for convenience observe 
that each of the expressions for 𝑉̇ , Equations [2-108], [2-109], and [2-118], can be written in the 
following form: 
𝑉̇ =
{
 
 
 
 𝑉

𝑉
𝛼2
𝑔2(𝒙, 𝑡)   ,   𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑉𝑐< 𝑉≤𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥
 
[2-146] 

89 
 
The functions 𝑔1(𝒙, 𝑡) and 𝑔2(𝒙, 𝑡) are simply used to represent the remaining terms in 𝑉̇  that are 
not functions of particle volume to avoid repeating the full expressions. Using Equation [2-146] 
for 𝑉̇  and applying the chain rule to 𝜕𝐴𝑖2(𝑉) 𝜕𝑉
⁄
, the group-II intragroup expansion/contraction 
source/sink term (i.e. the fourth term in Equation [2-137]) can be written as:

[2-149] 
Again, 𝑔2(𝒙, 𝑡) is only used as a placeholder for the remaining terms in the expressions for 𝑉̇  to 
avoid having to rewrite them here. For the approximate group-II bubble shapes presently 
considered, 𝛾2 can be expressed as:  
𝛾2 =

[2-150] 
 
Note that a group-I intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term shape factor (𝛾1) 
could be developed in a completely analogous manner to include the effects of bubble shape in 
the group-I intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term if necessary. Under the present 
assumption that 𝜑1 is a constant, 𝛾1=1. As such, 𝛾1 is not explicitly shown in the group-I 
intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term in Section 2.3.4.3.  

90 
 
 
To specify the intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms in Equations [2-136] 
and [2-137], 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) evaluated at the group boundary is required. Recall that the intergroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms should cancel when Equations [2-136] and [2-137] are 
added together to obtain the total interfacial area transport equation. However, since different 
bubble shapes are assumed in each group, the models presented above for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) are not equal 
when evaluated at the group boundary. As such, in order to ensure that the intergroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms cancel when obtaining the total interfacial area transport 
equation, the models presented above for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) should be regarded as valid for bubble volumes 
within each bubble group, respectively, but not at the group boundary. At the group boundary, 
𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) is defined to be 𝐴𝑖𝑐, For now, 𝐴𝑖𝑐 will be left unspecified and should be determined based 
on an appropriate shape for bubbles at the group boundary. 
 
Before proceeding to use the proposed models for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) to complete the two-group 
interfacial area transport equations in Section 2.3.4.3, it is emphasized that the models presented 
for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) in this Section were chosen with moderate diameter round pipes in mind. While they 
may be suitable to use in other duct geometries, one should assess their appropriateness before 
directly utilizing the above results. If different bubble shapes need to be assumed for a specific 
application, the approach outlined in this Section can provide guidelines for establishing new 
models for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉). 
2.3.4.3 Resulting Two-Group Interfacial Area Transport Equations 
 
To complete the two-group interfacial area transport equations, Equation [2-118] can be 
used for 𝑉̇  along with the models for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉) to specify the inter- and intragroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms in Equations [2-136] and [2-137]. Applying these 
Equations, the two-group interfacial area transport equations can be written as:

[2-152]
 
The left-hand sides of Equations [2-151] and [2-152] account for the local time rate of 
change and the advection of the group interfacial area concentrations, respectively. The first 
terms on the right-hand sides of the equations are the intragroup expansion/contraction 
source/sink terms. These terms represent the change in the group interfacial area concentrations 
due to expansion/contraction of existing particles within each group. This can occur due to 
evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of existing particles in the group and changes in 
the particle mass density. The second terms on the right-hand side of the equations are the 
intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms. These terms are sources/sinks to the group 
interfacial area concentrations due to expansion/contraction of particles across the group 
boundary. The remaining terms in the equations are the source/sink terms to the group interfacial 
area concentrations due to the jth-type particle interaction mechanisms, including both intra- and 
intergroup interactions (i.e. 𝜙𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎 and 𝜙𝑗,𝑘
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟), and nucleation/collapse phenomena, respectively.  
 
It is instructive to compare the two-group interfacial area transport equations presently 
obtained, Equations [2-151] and [2-152], to those obtained by Ishii and Kim (2004) that are given 
by Equations [1-13] and [1-14] and are repeated here for convenience:

[1-14] 
The differences observed between the intra- and intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink 
terms in Equations [2-151] and [2-152] and Equations [1-13] and [1-14] are due to the differences 
in the models obtained for 𝑉̇  in the present development and those used by Ishii and Kim (2004). 
Within the intra- and intergroup expansion/contraction source terms in Equations [2-151] and [2-
152], the effects of intergroup transfer are removed from the total change in the group void 
fractions; this is similar to how the effects of nucleation/collapse phenomena are removed. In this 
way, the changes in the group void fractions that drive the expansion/contraction source/sink 
terms in the present development are due to evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of 
existing particles and changes in the particle mass density. In Equations [1-13] and [1-14], the 
effects of intergroup transfer are not removed from the expansion/contraction source/sink terms. 
Therefore, the effects of intergroup transfer on the group interfacial area concentrations are 
effectively counted twice in Equations [1-13] and [1-14]. This situation is analogous to the 
example given in Section 2.2.4.3 where the effects of nucleation/collapse phenomena would be 
effectively double counted if 𝜂𝑛𝑢𝑐 is neglected in the expansion/contraction source/sink term.   
 
The form of the two-group interfacial area transport equations given by Equations [2-
151] and [2-152] is rather unwieldy. Also, it is prone to possible consistency issues similar to 
those discussed in Section 2.2.4.3 regarding the nucleation/collapse phenomena source/sink 
terms; now there can be possible consistency issues amongst the intergroup source/sink terms, as 

93 
 
well. To avoid possible inconsistencies in specifying the various source/sink terms and to 
simplify the equations, Equation [2-108] can be used to specify 𝑉̇  in Equations [2-136] and [2-
137] instead of Equation [2-118] to yield the following equivalent form of the two-group 
interfacial area transport equations:

[2-154] 
 
The various terms in Equations [2-153] and [2-154] are interpreted in the same way as 
described above. In this form, it is clear that the expansion/contraction source/sink terms are 
driven by evaporation/condensation across the interfaces of existing particles and changes in the 
particle mass density. In order to solve Equations [2-153] and [2-154] for the group interfacial 
area concentrations, the velocities 𝒗𝑖1 and 𝒗𝑖2 need to be determined. The constitutive models for 
𝛤𝑔1,𝑖 and 𝛤𝑔2,𝑖 should be the same as those used in the group continuity equations. The group void 
fractions (𝛼1 and 𝛼2) and the velocities (𝒗𝑔1 and 𝒗𝑔2) in the derivatives of the gas-phase density 
(i.e. 𝐷𝑔1𝜌𝑔𝐷𝑡
⁄
 and𝐷𝑔2𝜌𝑔𝐷𝑡
⁄
) can be obtained from the solution of the continuity and 
momentum equations in the two-fluid model. Models are also required for 𝜒, 𝐴𝑖𝑐, and 𝐴̅𝑖1 to 
complete the intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms. Furthermore, constitutive 
models for the source/sink terms due to particle interactions and nucleation/collapse phenomena 
in each group (𝜙𝑗,𝑘 and 𝜙𝑛𝑢𝑐,𝑘) are required.

2.4 Chapter Summary 
The detailed derivation of both the one-group and two-group interfacial area transport 
equations following the statistical approach analogous to the Boltzmann transport equation was 
presented in this Chapter. A new approach that appealed directly to the necessary agreement 
between the void transport equation(s) and continuity equation(s) in the two-fluid model was used 
to develop constitutive models for the unknown terms in the void transport equation(s). In 
particular, models for the rate of change of particle volume (𝑉̇ ) were developed and used 
complete the interfacial area transport equation(s). 
For the one-group case, the model developed for 𝑉̇  using the present approach agreed 
with the previous model developed by Ishii and Kim (2004). Consequently, the resulting one-
group interfacial area transport equation obtained in the present work is identical to that obtained 
by Ishii and Kim (2004). The present development, however, provided valuable insight into the 
relationship between the void and interfacial area concentration source/sink terms due to 
nucleation/collapse phenomena and the corresponding mass generation rate in the gas-phase 
continuity equation. These terms were discussed in view of maintaining consistency when 
developing source/sink term models and incorporating the interfacial area transport equation with 
the two-fluid model. 
 For the two-group case, the present model for 𝑉̇  is different than that proposed by Ishii 
and Kim (2004). Ishii and Kim’s (2004) model for 𝑉̇  includes the effects of intergroup transfer 
due to intergroup particle interactions and expansion/contraction of particles across the group 
boundary. However, using the present approach by directly combining the group continuity and 
void transport equations, the resulting model for 𝑉̇  was found to not include these effects. This 
finding directly impacts the intra- and intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms in the 
two-group interfacial area transport equation. Effectively, by including the effects of intergroup 

95 
 
transfer in the model for 𝑉̇ , these effects are double counted in the two-group interfacial area 
transport equations. This issue is corrected in the present development.  
Additionally, through investigation into models for 𝐴𝑖𝑘(𝑉), it was found that if the 
particle shape factor for the kth bubble group (𝜑𝑘) is a constant, the intragroup 
expansion/contraction source terms in the interfacial area transport equations will always contain 
a prefactor of 2𝑎𝑖𝑘3𝛼𝑘
⁄
= 4 𝐷𝑆𝑚𝑘
⁄
. Thus, the intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink 
terms scale on the inverses of the group Sauter-mean diameters (i.e. 𝐷𝑆𝑚𝑘= 6𝛼𝑘/𝑎𝑖𝑘) when 𝜑𝑘 
is constant. However, if 𝜑𝑘 is not constant, the prefactor will be different than 2𝑎𝑖𝑘3𝛼𝑘
⁄
. To 
investigate this, two approximate group-II bubble shapes for moderate diameter round pipes were 
considered: a spherical-cap bubble and an idealized slug bubble. The shape factor for a spherical-
cap bubble only depends on the wake angle, which can be assumed to be constant in many two-
phase flows of practical interest. However, the shape factor for the idealized slug bubble depends 
on particle volume, which yields a prefactor of 4 𝜆𝐷ℎ
⁄
 instead of 2𝑎𝑖2 3𝛼2
⁄
 in the group-II 
intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term. Therefore, for this case, the group-II 
expansion/contraction source/sink term is found to scale on the inverse of the slug bubble base 
diameter (i.e. (𝜆𝐷ℎ)−1). To generalize the effect of different group-II bubble shapes on the group-
II intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term, an analytical expression for a group-II 
intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term shape factor (𝛾2) was introduced.  
In view of the discussion in this Chapter regarding consistency of the source/sink terms, 
the recommended forms of the equations developed in this Chapter are summarized as follows:

Experimental Investigations 
This Chapter discusses the experimental work performed in the present dissertation. First, 
an overview of the experimental facility that is utilized is provided in the Section 3.1. Then, 
efforts that were undertaken to improve the local multi-sensor conductivity probe measurement 
technique through systematic investigation of several practical aspects of the conductivity probe 
measurement system are discussed in Section 3.2. Lastly, the investigation into cap-bubbly 
transition two-phase flows to establish an experimental database that highlights transition from 
one-group to two-group flows is discussed in Section 3.3. 
3.1 Experimental Facility 
Experiments in air-water two-phase flow are performed in the Combinatorial Channel 
Two-Phase Flow Test Facility at the Advanced Multi-Phase Flow Laboratory at the Pennsylvania 
State University (Kim et al., 2008). The facility consists of both vertical and horizontal sections 
of 5.08cm inner diameter clear acrylic pipes connected by four glass 90° vertical elbows in a loop 
configuration. The facility was designed to study the geometric effects of vertical elbows and 
channel orientation change on two-phase flow transport. However, the focus of this dissertation is 
only on vertical-upward two-phase flow. Therefore, for the present study, the full-loop 
configuration of the facility was bypassed to create an exclusively vertical-upward test section. 
This expanded the range of two-phase flow conditions that could be investigated. The details of 
the vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow test facility are discussed in Section 3.1.1, and the 
instrumentation available at the facility is discussed in Section 3.1.2. 

98 
 
3.1.1 Vertical-Upward Air-Water Two-Phase Flow Test Facility 
Figure 3-1 shows a schematic of the vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow test 
facility, and a photograph of the test section is shown in Figure 3-2. The major components of the 
test facility include the: 1) air-water supply system, 2) dual-stage two-phase flow injector, 3) test 
section, 4) instrumentation ports, and 5) two-phase damper-separator system. The details of these 
components are discussed in Sections 3.1.1.1 through 3.1.1.5, respectively.

3.1.1.1 Air-Water Supply System 
A 15HP Quincy QGB15V rotary screw air compressor is used to provide compressed air 
to the test facility. The Quincy QGB15V compressor has an inlet capacity of 56.8 ACFM and 
provides compressed air at a gauge pressure of 689kpa (100psig).  After the compressor, an inline 
air dryer and filter system remove any moisture and contaminants from the compressed air that 
might have been introduced during the compression process. The dry, clean air is then fed to two 
air accumulator tanks that are connected in series with volumes 1.51m3 (400 gal.) and 0.45m3 
(120 gal.). The tanks provide sufficient capacity to minimize fluctuations in the air supply at high 
gas flow rates. From the air accumulator tanks, the air is regulated to a gauge pressure of 414kPa 
(60psig) and supplied to an array of air rotameters that meter the air flow to the test section.  
Water is supplied to the test section from a 2.27m3
 (600 gal.) water accumulator tank by a 
45kW (60HP) Dean Model pH-2140 centrifugal pump. The pump has a 0.22m (8.5 in.) impeller. 
An AC Tech MH4600B variable frequency drive is used to control the pump speed and, 
consequently, adjust the liquid flow rate. Prior to filling the water accumulator tank, the water is 
filtered through an active charcoal filter followed by a series of mixed resin bed filters to obtain 
deionized water.  Additionally, upstream of the test section, an inline 20μm filter is used to 
remove particulates that may enter the system. The filtered water is then treated with ammonium 
hydroxide and morpholine to control the conductivity and pH. The total ammonium hydroxide 
concentration in the water is 0.0012M, and the concentration of morpholine in the water is 
0.0015M. These chemicals provide conductivity in the water that is required to operate different 
instrumentation in the facility, and they minimize corrosion in the pump by making the water 
basic. The water conductivity is maintained at 100µS/cm, which is measured using a Hanna 
Instruments DiST3® (HI98303) conductivity meter. The calibration of the conductivity meter is 
checked regularly against standard calibration solutions from Hanna Instruments®.  

101 
 
3.1.1.2 Dual-Stage Two-Phase Flow Injector 
 
The air and water supplies join in a specialized dual-stage two-phase flow injector that is 
designed to introduce two-phase flow to the test section while maintaining a controlled inlet 
bubble size. This is achieved through a double-annulus liquid injection configuration. A 
schematic of the dual-stage two-phase flow injector is shown in Figure 3-3. The outer annulus is 
formed between an outer acrylic pipe with an inner diameter of 7.62cm (3in.) and an inner acrylic 
pipe with an outer diameter of 4.45cm (1.75in.). The outer and inner acrylic pipes are glued into a 
lower acrylic flange that is bolted to a stainless steel baseplate. The lower flange and baseplate 
have holes in their centers that line up with the inside of the inner pipe. A 3.18mm (0.125in.) O-
ring seals the lower flange against the baseplate. An upper acrylic flange is glued to the outer pipe 
such that the upper face of the flange is flush with the end of the outer pipe. A 7.63cm (3in.) inner 
diameter to 5.08cm (2in.) inner diameter acrylic reducer that is 7.63cm (3in.) long connects the 
upper flange of the injector to the first pipe of the test section. 3.18mm (0.125in.) O-rings seal the 
connections on each side of the reducer. The end of the inner pipe extends 2.54cm (1in.) beyond 
the upper flange into the reducer to minimize the change in flow area between the outer annulus 
and the test section. This is done to reduce the effects of the flow area change on the bubble 
injection.   
 
A 1.91cm (0.75in.) outer diameter stainless steel air sparger is centered within the inner 
acrylic pipe, which has an inner diameter of 3.18cm (1.25in.). The gap between the sparger and 
the inner acrylic pipe forms the inner annulus. The top 10.16cm (4in.) of the sparger is fabricated 
from sintered stainless steel with an average pore size of 10μm. A solid stainless end-cap is 
welded to the end of the sintered portion. The top of the end-cap is aligned to be even with the 
upper end of the inner pipe when the sparger is installed. The opposite end of the sparger is an 
open stainless steel tube that passes through the lower acrylic flange and a 3.81cm (1.5in.) 

102 
 
stainless steel tee that is welded to the underside of the stainless steel baseplate. The vertical leg 
of the tee that the sparger passes through has a 3.81cm (1.5in.) to 2.54cm (1in.) stainless steel 
reducer and 2.54cm (1in.) pipe stub welded to it. A 2.54cm (1in.) to 1.91cm (0.75in.) Swagelok® 
reducing union is used to connect the sparger to the pipe stub. The remaining portion of the 
sparger that passes through the reducing union is connected to the air-supply line through a 
Swagelok® elbow and check valve. When no air flow is supplied to the sparger, liquid can seep 
through the sintered stainless steel into the air line. Therefore, the check valve is installed in the 
air-supply line immediately before the connection to the sparger to minimize the volume where 
water could collect. Figure 3-4(a) shows a photograph of the dual-stage two-phase flow injector, 
acrylic reducer, and connection to the first pipe of the test section. Figure 3-4(b) shows a 
photograph of the underside of the dual-stage two-phase flow injector that highlights the 
connections to the sparger. 
 
Upstream of the injector, the water supply from the pump is separated into main and 
auxiliary liquid flows. The main liquid flow enters a manifold and is split further among three 
lines. These three lines supply the main liquid flow to the outer annulus through three 3.81cm 
(1.5in.) inlets that are spaced 120° apart around the circumference of the outer pipe to reduce 
swirling of the main liquid flow in the outer annulus. The auxiliary liquid flow is fed at 3.15x10-4 
m3/s (5gpm) to the horizontal leg of the stainless steel tee underneath the baseplate; see Figure 3-
4(b). As such, a constant liquid flow is supplied around the sparger in the inner annulus. Air is 
supplied to the sparger, and the constant auxiliary liquid flow in the inner annulus shears off 
bubbles at an average size of about 2-3mm from the porous end of the sparger, independent of the 
main liquid flow rate. Thus, only the main liquid flow rate supplied to the outer annulus is varied 
when setting a desired flow condition.

3.1.1.3 Test Section 
The test section is constructed from clear cast acrylic pipes with a nominal inner diameter 
(D) of 5.08cm (2in.). The pipes and instrumentation ports are connected to each other through 
bolted flanged connections that are sealed by 3.18mm (0.125in.) O-rings. The instrumentation 
ports are discussed in detail Section 3.1.1.4. The pipes and instrumentation ports that were used to 
construct the vertical-upward test section were selected from among the available pipes and 
instrumentation ports at the Combinatorial Two-Phase Flow Test Facility (Kim et al., 2008). The 
inner diameters at both ends of the pipes and instrumentation ports were measured with a 
telescoping gauge and caliper. Adjacent pipes and instrumentation ports were selected to 
minimize differences in their inner diameters to ensure a smooth transition between the 
components at the flanged connections. The maximum and average differences between the inner 
diameters of adjacent flanged connections were 0.73mm (0.029in.) and 0.36mm (0.014in.), 
respectively. These differences in inner diameters correspond to maximum and average 
deviations at the inner pipe wall at the transition between adjacent flanged connections of 
0.36mm (0.014in.) and 0.18mm (0.007in.), respectively.  
The test section is supported along its length with acrylic connector blocks that are bolted 
to a surrounding steel structure. Figure 3-5 shows a schematic of a connector block. A connector 
block consists of two mating halves which have semicircular holes to accommodate a pipe with 
ample clearance. Threaded holes pass through the connector blocks at 120° apart around the 
circumference of the pipe.  3/8-16 PTFE threaded rods are tightened through these holes against 
the pipe to secure its position; PTFE is used to avoid scratching the acrylic pipe. Adjusting the 
threaded rods separately allows for precise alignment of the pipe sections. During assembly, great 
care was taken to align the test section to within ±0.1° of vertical using both a conventional spirit 
level and a digital level. The total assembled length of the test section is 3.35m (11ft.).  

105

3.1.1.4 Instrumentation Ports 
The instrumentation ports provide access to the flow for various instruments and facilitate 
visualization of the flow. The instrumentation ports are constructed from blocks of clear cast 
acrylic that have a hole bored through their lengths with the same inner diameter as the pipe 
sections. Pressure taps are implemented in the instrumentation ports to obtain pressure 
measurements in the flow. Furthermore, the instrumentation ports facilitate precise positioning of 
the multi-sensor conductivity probe with a linear traverse so that local measurements of various 
two-phase flow parameters can be obtained throughout the cross-section. Lastly, a flat face is 
machined onto the port to reduce the optical distortion due to the curvature of the pipe wall 
during flow visualization with a high speed video camera. 
Two types of instrumentation port are available at the facility: 1) fixed and 2) rotating 
instrumentation ports. In vertical-upward two-phase flow, the distribution of two-phase flow 
parameters in the pipe cross-section can be assumed to be axisymmetric. Therefore, fixed 
instrumentation ports are available that allow the conductivity probe to be traversed across one 

106 
 
diameter of the pipe during an experiment. Figures 3-6(a) and (b) show an exploded view 
drawing and a photograph of a fixed instrumentation port, respectively. 
If the distribution of two-phase flow parameters is asymmetric, however, it is necessary 
to perform conductivity probe measurements throughout the entire cross-section. Horizontal two-
phase flows present such a case where the gas-phase distribution is inherently asymmetric due to 
buoyancy. The flow structure downstream of flow restrictions can also be asymmetric and present 
interesting features that could not be readily captured with a fixed instrumentation port design. 
Therefore, unique rotating instrumentation ports are available at the Combinatorial Two-Phase 
Flow Test Facility (Kim et al., 2008). These ports can be rotated around the axis of the pipe to 
every 22.5° without stopping the flow. This allows the conductivity probe to be traversed along 
eight diameters of the pipe to obtain measurements throughout the entire cross-section. Figures 3-
7(a) and (b) show an exploded view drawing and a photograph of a rotating instrumentation port. 
Four instrumentation ports are available along the length of the vertical-upward test 
section. The centers of the instrumentation ports are located at 7.5, 18, 34.5, and 63 pipe inner 
diameters downstream of the test section inlet. The bottom of the first pipe section that connects 
to the top of the acrylic reducer at the dual-stage two-phase flow injector is regarded as the test 
section inlet (i.e. L=0D). When constructing the vertical-upward test section, two fixed and two 
rotating instrumentation ports were used. The rotating instrumentation ports are 30.48cm (12in.) 
long, and the fixed instrumentation ports are 15.24cm (6in.) long. Therefore, the longer rotating 
instrumentation ports were used to obtain the desired axial measurement locations and to meet 
length requirements of the test section to connect to the bypass line to the to the damper/separator 
system. As a benefit, the rotating instrumentation ports provide the capability to confirm that the 
flow is axisymmetric in the vertical-upward test facility without stopping the flow. Rotating 
instrumentation ports, P1 and P3, are located at 18D and 63D from the test section inlet, and fixed 
instrumentation ports, P0 and P2, are located at 7.5D and 34.5D from the test section inlet.

3.1.1.5 Two-Phase Damper-Separator System 
After exiting the test section, the two-phase flow travels to a two-stage damper-separator 
system that is designed to separate the phases to prevent air from returning to the water 
accumulator tank and entering the pump. In the first stage, the damper slows down the flow and 
breaks up large gas pockets into smaller bubbles to promote better phase separation. The damper 
is constructed from a 0.106m3 (28 gal.) rectangular plastic tank. The flow is supplied to the 
damper through two inlet lines to counteract large scale rotation of the flow in the damper. Inside 
the damper, a series of three successively finer wire mesh screens are installed to facilitate 
breaking up the gas into smaller bubbles and reducing the inertia of the flow. After passing 
through the last screen, the flow exits through the bottom of the damper to the separator. 
The separator is constructed from a similar plastic tank. Inside the separator there are two 
perforated baffles. The baffles stagnate the flow in the separator, allowing the air to separate from 
the liquid. Plastic lids cover the damper and separator tanks during operation of the test facility.  
However, the damper-separator system is not sealed, such that the air exits to the room. The 
liquid exits the bottom of the separator to return to the water accumulator tank to be recirculated 
through the facility. Photographs of the damper and separator tanks are shown in Figure 3-8.

the tanks during operation of the test facility are not shown to highlight the internal components.

3.1.2 Instrumentation 
3.1.2.1 Flow Meters 
 
For measurement of water flow rates, the test facility employs both rotameters and an 
electromagnetic flow meter. A Yamatake MagneW Two-wire PLUS electromagnetic flow meter 
(Model MTG18B) with an accuracy of ±0.5% is employed for water flow rates greater than 
1.0m/s because of lower sensitivity at smaller flow rates. Hence, for water flow rate 
measurements below 1.0m/s, a combination of rotameters with accuracies of ±2% of full scale are 
employed. The auxiliary flow rate in the dual-stage two-phase flow injector is metered by a 
rotameter with the same accuracy. The air flow rate is measured downstream of a pressure 
regulator using an array of Dwyer Series RMB rotameters with accuracies of ±3% of full scale.
 
Experimental conditions in the test section are specified by the superficial liquid velocity 
(〈𝑗𝑓〉) and the superficial gas velocity (〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧). By definition, the superficial liquid and gas 
velocities are the volumetric fluxes of liquid and gas through the pipe cross-section such that: 
〈𝑗𝑓〉= 𝑄𝑓
𝐴 
[3-1] 
〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧= 𝑄𝑔,𝑧
𝐴
= 𝑄𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚
𝐴
(
𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚
𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚+ 𝑝𝑧
) 
[3-2] 
𝑄𝑓 is the liquid volumetric flow rate through the cross-sectional area of the test section (𝐴). 
Likewise, 𝑄𝑔,𝑧 is the gas volumetric flow rate through the cross-sectional area of the test section. 
𝑄𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚 is the equivalent gas volumetric flow rate at atmospheric pressure, which is calculated 
from the gas flow rate set at the gas rotameters and the back pressure. 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚 is atmospheric 

111 
 
pressure, and 𝑝𝑧 is the gauge pressure. The subscript “z” indicates the axial location along the test 
section. For example, 〈𝑗𝑔〉18𝐷 corresponds to the gas superficial velocity evaluated at 18D from 
the inlet of the test section. Here, the brackets  〈
〉 are used to indicate that 〈𝑗𝑓〉 and 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 
represent cross-sectional average quantities, as opposed to local quantities that are defined point-
wise in the cross-section like the local conductivity probe measurements. The brackets do not 
imply that an averaging operation was performed on local values of 𝑗𝑓 and 𝑗𝑔 to calculate 〈𝑗𝑓〉 and 
〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧. The data reduction procedures used to calculate 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 at different axial locations in the test 
section based on the gas rotameter and pressure measurements are provided in Appendix A.  
 3.1.2.2 Differential Pressure Transducer and Dial Pressure Gauges 
Pressure is measured in the test section using a Yamatake ST3000 Series 900 (Model 
STD920) differential pressure transmitter with an accuracy of ±0.075% of the calibrated span.   
The pressure transducer can be used to measure gauge pressure by leaving one pressure port open 
to the atmosphere. Additionally, a 0-60psig dial gauge with an accuracy of ±1% of the full scale 
reading for pressures over the entire scale is available to perform gauge pressure measurements of 
the flow in the test section. This dial gauge is used in conjunction with the differential pressure 
transmitter to perform pressure measurements in the facility if the gauge pressures to be measured 
are outside the range of the transmitter. In this case, the dial gauge is used to measure the gauge 
pressure at a reference port (e.g. P0 (7.5D)), and the differential pressure transmitter is used to 
measure the differential pressures between the other ports. The gauge pressure at the exit of the 
air rotameters, referred to as the back pressure (𝑝𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘), is measured using a 0-100psig dial gauge. 
For pressures within the first and last quarters of the scale on this gauge, the accuracy is ±2% of 
the full scale reading, and for pressures within the middle half of the scale (i.e. pressures within 
25% to 75% of the full scale) the accuracy is ±1% of the full scale reading. 

112 
 
3.1.2.3 High-Speed Video Camera 
A Photron 512 PCI FASTCAM high-speed video camera is available to perform flow 
visualizations. It has full resolution of 512 x 512-pixels up to 2000 frames per second (fps) and 
reduced resolution with increasing frame rate up to 32,000 fps. High intensity halogen and LED 
lights are available to provide adequate illumination of the flow to capture high speed videos. 
3.1.2.4 Local Four-Sensor Conductivity Probe 
The state-of-the-art four-sensor conductivity probe is used to acquire measurements of 
local time-averaged local two-phase flow parameters. A schematic of the four-sensor conductivity 
probe is shown in Figure 3-9. Some of the most important parameters that can be obtained with 
the conductivity probe are the: void fraction, interfacial area concentration, bubble velocity, 
bubble Sauter-mean diameter, and bubble frequency. The basic operating principle of the 
conductivity probe was discussed in Chapter 1. Also, Kim et al. (2000) provide a concise 
overview of the four-sensor conductivity probe methodology and signal processing scheme used 
in the present work, and additional details are given by Fu (2001) and Bernard (2014). As 
discussed in Chapter 1, previous benchmark studies indicate ±10% agreement between two-phase 
flow parameters obtained with the conductivity probe and other two-phase flow instrumentation 
(Kim et al., 2000; Le Corre et al., 2003; Manera et al., 2009).

113 
 
3.1.2.5 Data Acquisition System 
A data acquisition system (DAQ) is used to acquire voltage measurements from the 
electromagnetic flow meter, pressure transducer, and four-sensor conductivity probe. The data 
acquisition system consists of a National Instruments PCI-6259 data acquisition board and 
shielded SCB-68 connector box. The PCI-6259 is a high speed multifunction M-series data 
acquisition board optimized for superior accuracy at fast sampling rates. It has 32 analog 16-bit 
inputs with a sample rate of 1.25 million samples per second (MS/s) for a single channel and 1 
MS/s (aggregate) for multichannel inputs. The SCB-68 is a noise rejecting shielded I/O connector 
block for use with 68-pin M-Series data acquisition devices. Measurements from the instruments 
are recorded using the National Instruments LabVIEW software. 
3.2 Improvement of Local Conductivity Probe Measurement System 
As discussed in Chapter 1, significant efforts have been made to develop and benchmark 
the conductivity probe, and it has been widely used to establish extensive databases of local two-
phase flow parameters. While the efficacy of the conductivity probe has been clearly 
demonstrated, few studies have been performed to systematically assess the effects of different 
components of a conductivity probe measurement system on the measured two-phase flow 
parameters. Therefore, to further advance the local multi-sensor conductivity probe measurement 
technique, several practical aspects of a conductivity probe measurement system are investigated 
including: 1) signal “ghosting” electrical interference among probe sensors, 2) data acquisition 
sampling frequency, 3) measurement duration, and 4) sensor orientation in the flow channel. The 
investigations into each of these items are discussed in Sections 3.2.1 through 3.2.4, respectively.       

114 
 
3.2.1 Signal “Ghosting” in Conductivity Probe Measurement 
Talley (2012) observed artificially high bubble velocity measurements and, consequently, 
artificially low interfacial area concentration measurements with increasing data acquisition 
sampling frequency (𝑓𝑠) while determining an appropriate sampling frequency for conductivity 
probe measurements in his study of horizontal bubbly two-phase flows. This behavior was found 
to be due to a hardware related issue known as signal “ghosting” (DAQ M Series User Manual, 
2008). Signal ghosting is inherent when a multiplexing DAQ is used to sample multiple high 
impedance voltage sources, such as the conductivity probe sensors. In a multiplexing DAQ, a 
multiplexer switches between each input channel and a common analog-to-digital converter 
(ADC) in rapid succession to acquire digitized representations of the analog input signals at the 
specified sampling frequency. High source impedances sampled by the input channels increase 
the settling time of the DAQ’s instrumentation amplifier due to its capacitance. The increased 
settling time can cause remnants of a signal sampled on the previous channel to appear on the 
current channel being sampled (DAQ M Series User Manual, 2008). This effect becomes more 
pronounced at higher sampling frequencies, as the time between samples becomes closer to the 
DAQ’s settling time.  
Signal ghosting can affect the measured time delay between the upstream and 
downstream sensors, thus influencing the velocity and interfacial area concentration 
measurements. The effects of ghosting depend on sampling frequency and the impedance of the 
sensor circuit. Sampling frequency is a critical parameter in conductivity probe measurements, as 
the sampling frequency must be high enough to preserve the sensor signal quality for accurate 
analysis. An appropriate sampling frequency depends on several factors including bubble speed, 
size, and packing. Therefore, it is impractical to restrict sampling frequency to mitigate ghosting 
effects. The most robust solution to eliminating signal ghosting is to use a simultaneous sampling 

115 
 
DAQ, in which each input channel has a dedicated instrumentation amplifier and ADC, 
eliminating the need for a multiplexer. This DAQ architecture provides improved isolation 
amongst the sampled input signals and is not subject to signal ghosting. However, if a 
multiplexing DAQ is to be used, a revision to the conductivity probe circuit is required to reduce 
the source impedances of the sensors to eliminate the effects of signal ghosting.  
3.2.1.1 Conductivity Probe Circuit Revision 
Figure 3-10 shows a schematic of a simple DC circuit for the kth-sensor of a multi-sensor 
conductivity probe that has been used in previous studies (Cartellier and Achard, 1991; Kim et al. 
2000) The sensor can be thought of as having some resistance (𝑅𝑐,𝑘) when the sensor is in the 
liquid phase and having an effectively infinite resistance when the sensor is in the gas phase. 
Thus, the measured voltage (𝑉𝑘) indicates whether the sensor is in the liquid (low voltage signal) 
or gas phase (high voltage signal). Simply based on the switch-like behavior of the conductivity 
probe sensors, the conductivity probe circuit is inherently a high impedance source that is 
susceptible to ghosting with a multiplexing DAQ. 
To eliminate signal ghosting of high impedance sources, the source impedances seen by 
the DAQ must be reduced. This can be achieved through the addition of a voltage follower to the 
source circuits (DAQ M Series User Manual, 2008). The output of an ideal voltage follower 
exactly reproduces the input signal with zero impedance. Thus, a voltage follower can transform a 
high impedance source to a low impedance source. Figure 3-11 shows the revised conductivity 
probe circuit that incorporates a voltage follower to eliminate signal ghosting. A resistor (Rd) of 
value within the recommended input impedance range for the DAQ, is implemented between the 
output of the voltage follower and the DAQ to ensure stability of the op-amp. In the current 
study, Ra and Rd are 51kΩ and 500Ω resistors, respectively. Rb,k is a 1MΩ potentiometer. Since 

116 
 
each sensor in a multi-sensor conductivity probe has its own impedance, the corresponding 
potentiometer for each sensor is set to a different resistance value to maintain a baseline voltage 
level when the kth-sensor is in the liquid phase. The potentiometer resistances are set to around 
200kΩ for the probe sensors used in this study to maintain a baseline voltage level around 4V.

incorporates a voltage follower to eliminate signal ghosting.

3.2.1.2 Experimental Investigation 
Experiments were performed to characterize the effects of signal ghosting on the 
conductivity probe measurement with the original circuit and to assess the performance of the 
revised circuit. In order to obtain concurrent measurements with the two circuits to directly 
compare the ghosted and un-ghosted signals obtained from the same bubbles, a specialized 
conductivity probe, referred to herein as a dual double-sensor probe, was fabricated.  
The sensors of the dual double-sensor probe are shown in Figure 3-12. Following the 
design of the miniaturized four-sensor conductivity probe (Kim et al., 2000) the probe sensors 
were fabricated from stainless steel acupuncture needles. The probe was designed with two 
upstream sensors (sensors 0 and 1) and two downstream sensors (sensors 2 and 3) to form two 
independent double-sensor probes that could be used to perform concurrent measurements with 
the original and the revised circuits. Recall from Figure 1-4 that the sensors in a double-sensor 
probe are electrically insulated from each other. Each sensor is connected to a grounded metallic 
probe body through the surrounding conductive liquid in the flow. When a sensor is located 
inside of a bubble, the circuit is broken, yielding a rise in the measured voltage for that sensor. 
The dual-double sensor probe operates in the same way. Having two double sensor probes at 
effectively the same position in the flow allows one to characterize the effects of the original and 
revised conductivity probe circuits on the measured two-phase flow parameters based on the 
same bubbles. As such, the upstream sensors were positioned such that the sensing tips were as 
close as possible to minimize differences in the measurements. Likewise, the downstream sensors 
were positioned at approximately the same axial distance from the upstream sensors. Sensors 0 
and 3 were chosen as one double-sensor pair, and sensors 1 and 2 were chosen as the other 
double-sensor pair because these pairs were most in-line with each other. The axial distances 
between the upstream and downstream sensors for sensor pairs 0-3 and 1-2 were each 1.68mm.  

118 
 
 
Figure 3-12: Dual double-sensor conductivity probe fabricated to investigate the signal 
characteristics of the original and revised conductivity probe circuits.  
 
Measurements of co-current vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow were performed 
with the dual double-sensor probe to investigate the effects of signal ghosting on the conductivity 
probe measurement. The dual-double sensor probe was installed in P2 (L=34.5D) in the vertical-
upward test section. This axial location was chosen for the measurements since the flow was 
determined to be sufficiently developed by this point. Measurements were performed in a flow 
condition with 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 2.00 m/s and 〈𝑗𝑔〉34.5𝐷 = 0.19m/s. This bubbly flow condition was selected 
because multiple measurements had been previously performed with the revised circuit, providing 
confidence in the repeatability of the results. Measurements were acquired by traversing the dual-
double sensor probe across the pipe diameter in non-dimensional radial increments (r/R) of 0.1. 
Here, r is the dimensional radial coordinate, and R is inner radius of the test section. Data was 
acquired at each r/R for 60s at 𝑓𝑠=50kHz. This sampling frequency is similar to that used by 
Talley (2012) where significant ghosting effects were observed. To isolate the sensor pairs, two 
National Instruments PCI-6259 M-Series DAQs were used. One DAQ was used to measure the 
signals from one sensor pair connected through the original circuit, and the other DAQ was used 
to measure the signals from the other sensor pair connected through the revised circuit. Figure 3-
13 shows a schematic of the data acquisition setup with the dual-double sensor conductivity 
probe. Concurrent measurements were acquired with sensor pair 0-3 connected through the 
original circuit, while sensor pair 1-2 was connected through the revised circuit; this is denoted as 
“Circuit-Sensor-Pair Combination I.” Also, measurements were acquired with the opposite 

119 
 
circuit-sensor-pair combination (i.e. sensor pair 1-2 connected through the original circuit and 
sensor pair 0-3 connected through the revised circuit) without stopping the flow to identify any 
differences between the sensor pairs and separate DAQs. The latter combination is denoted as 
“Circuit-Sensor-Pair Combination II.” 
 
Figure 3-13: Schematic of the setup of data acquisition systems with dual double-sensor 
conductivity probe for signal ghosting investigation.  
Figure 3-14 shows the raw signals acquired with the dual double-sensor probe for a single 
bubble to demonstrate the characteristics of ghosting in the conductivity probe measurement. 
There are two distinct features of the signals from pair 1-2, connected through the original circuit, 
that are indicative of ghosting. The bubble first contacts sensor 1, causing its signal to rise. Even 
though the bubble has not contacted sensor 2 yet, a premature rise in the sensor 2 signal occurs 
due to ghosting off of the rising sensor 1 signal. When the bubble actually contacts sensor 2, the 
signal begins to rise faster. A similar behavior occurs on the falling edge of the sensor 1 signal. 
The bubble leaves sensor 1 first, so the signal begins to fall. However, a sharp fall is delayed 

120 
 
because the sensor 1 signal ghosts off of the sensor 2 signal that is at the high voltage state. The 
signals from sensors 0 and 3 that were acquired with the revised circuit demonstrate the expected 
rise and fall characteristics of the raw signal.  
 
Figure 3-14: Comparison of voltage signals acquired with the original and revised circuits to 
identify the characteristics of ghosting in the conductivity probe signals.  
An ideal conductivity probe would yield step responses. However, owing to capacitance 
in the probe circuit and the wetting/de-wetting phenomena involved as the sensors penetrate the 
bubble interfaces, the rising and falling edges of the measured voltage signals have an 
exponential character. Therefore, a major task in processing the raw signals is to generate square 
signals with rising and falling edges that correspond to the points of contact with the front and 
rear interfaces of the bubbles. This is achieved through voltage thresholds and slope criteria to 
identify the points of contact with the interfaces as when the raw signals rise above and below the 
baseline voltage and maximum voltage within a given bubble, respectively (Kim et al., 2000) 

121 
 
Therefore, the premature rise of the downstream sensor is problematic because it can cause the 
rising edge to be identified too early, leading to error in the bubble velocity and interfacial area 
concentration measurements. The delayed fall of the upstream sensor was not observed to affect 
the measurements for this flow condition as the falling edge is identified at the high side of the 
signal. However, the delayed fall may become more important in higher void fraction conditions 
where bubbles follow each other more closely.   
The void fraction measurements obtained from each of the upstream sensors (0 and 1) 
showed negligible differences, which indicates that ghosting did not influence the void fraction 
measurement for this flow condition. However, significant effects of ghosting were observed in 
the bubble velocity and interfacial area concentration measurements. Figures 3-15(a) and (c) 
show the local bubble velocity and interfacial area concentration measurements, respectively, that 
were acquired with sensor pair 0-3 connected through the original circuit and sensor pair 1-2 
connected through the revised circuit. Likewise, Figures 3-15(b) and (d) show the results obtained 
with the opposite combination of sensor pairs and circuits. Significantly higher bubble velocities 
were measured with both sensor pairs connected through the original circuit compared to the 
revised circuit. Assuming that the bubbles follow the liquid in a dispersed bubbly flow, the 
bubble velocities measured with the original circuit are higher than expected, particularly for 
sensor pair 0-3, for this 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 2.00m/s flow condition. The interfacial area concentration 
measurements obtained with the original circuit are lower than those obtained with the revised 
circuit since the interfacial area concentration is inversely proportional to the measured velocity. 
Furthermore, comparing the measurements obtained with the original circuit with the 
different sensor pairs, it is observed that the magnitude of the ghosting effect depends on the 
sensors. Owing to differences in tip condition, each sensor has its own impedance. Therefore, one 
can expect to see different effects of ghosting with the different sensors. Sensor pair 0-3 with the 
original circuit yields much higher bubble velocity, and consequently lower interfacial area 

122 
 
concentration, measurements compared to the measurements with sensor pair 1-2 with the 
original circuit. On the other hand, the measurements obtained with each sensor pair with the 
revised circuit are very comparable. Thus, the revised circuit removes the variability that can 
occur with the original circuit due to ghosting.

In addition to comparing the local bubble velocity measurements, one can compare the 
volumetric gas flux (i.e. 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧) calculated from the local conductivity probe measurements to the 
volumetric gas flux based on the gas rotameter and pressure measurements. An estimate of the 
volumetric gas flux can be obtained by area-averaging the product of the local void fraction and 
bubble velocity measurements obtained with the conductivity probe (i.e. 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧= 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧). The 
area-average is performed by numerically integrating the product of the local the local 𝛼 and 𝑣𝑔 
measurements obtained with the local conductivity probe in the pipe cross-section. The 
volumetric gas flux based on the gas rotameter and pressure measurements is given by Equation 
[3-2]. The data reduction procedures used to calculate 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧 and 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 are provided in Appendix 
A. Comparing 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧 to 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 provides a way to benchmark the local conductivity probe 
measurements against the gas rotameter and pressure measurements.  
Table 3-1 shows a comparison of 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 calculated in each way for each circuit-sensor pair 
combination shown in Figure 3-15. 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧 based on measurements acquired with the original 
circuit is greater than 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 for both sensor pairs, which further supports that ghosting can cause 
higher bubble velocity measurements than expected. Moreover, the percent differences between 
〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧 and 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 for each sensor pair, +32% for pair 0-3 and +8% for pair 1-2, are significantly 
different, which clearly demonstrates the artificial variability in the measurement that can result 
from ghosting. 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧 based on measurements acquired with the revised circuit differ from 〈𝑗〉𝑧 
by about -10% for each sensor pair, demonstrating the improved consistency between the sensor 
pairs by removing the ghosting.

Recall that 𝑓𝑠=50kHz was chosen to highlight the effects of signal ghosting in the dual 
double-sensor probe experiment. To see the effects of ghosting at a lower sampling frequency, 
similar to that used in used in previous studies (Kim et al., 2000; Le Corre et al. 2003; Manera et 
al., 2009) consider the measurements shown in Figure 3-16 that were acquired at  𝑓𝑠=12kHz  with 
a conventional four-sensor conductivity probe at P1 (L=18D). The same inlet flow condition that 
was used for the experiment with the dual-double sensor probe was used for these measurements. 
The measurements at each r/R location were first performed using the revised circuit. Then, 
without stopping the flow, the measurements were retaken using the original circuit. The 
measured velocities with the original circuit compared to those with the revised circuit are 
consistently higher due to signal ghosting. However, the differences are significantly reduced due 
to the lower sampling frequency. The expected trend of lower interfacial area concentration 
values obtained with the original circuit compared to the revised circuit is also observed. 
Although the effects of signal ghosting at the lower sampling frequency are less pronounced, 
signal ghosting still introduces a systematic error that can be eliminated with the revised circuit.

3.2.2 Data Acquisition Sampling Frequency Sensitivity 
Having removed the effects of signal ghosting, the revised conductivity probe circuit can 
be used to investigate the effects of sampling frequency on the measured two-phase flow 
parameters. The DAQ samples continuous sensor voltages at discrete points in time. This 
discreteness impacts every aspect of the signal analysis. Small bubbles or bubbles that just graze 
the sensor may not be identified if their voltage signals contain an insufficient number of points. 
Similarly, as bubble velocity increases, higher sampling frequencies are required to adequately 
resolve the bubble signals so that they are identified. Not identifying bubbles directly impacts the 
measured bubble number frequency (𝑓𝑏), the number of bubbles detected by the upstream sensor 
divided by the measurement duration. The measured void fraction can also be affected by missing 
bubbles. Additionally, in view of Equation [1-19], the uncertainty in the measured void fraction 
depends on the sampling frequency since the sampling frequency influences the uncertainty in the 
measured gas residence times. Likewise, the sampling frequency affects the uncertainty in the 
measured time delays between the upstream and downstream sensors and, consequently, the

measured velocities. Thus, the sampling frequency also affects the measured interfacial area 
concentration since it depends on the number of interfaces detected and the measured velocities. 
To study the effect of sampling frequency on the measured two-phase flow parameters, 
conductivity probe measurements were performed in 13 two-phase flow conditions, which are 
given in Table 3-2. The flow conditions span the bubbly and slug flow regimes on the Mishima 
and Ishii (1984) flow regime map. The measurements were performed at P2 (L=34.5D) at r/R=0.0 
with a conventional four-sensor conductivity probe (Kim et al., 2000). In view of the maximum 
aggregate sampling frequency that the NI PCI-6259 DAQ is capable of, the sensors of a four-
sensor conductivity probe can each be sampled at a maximum sampling frequency of 250kHz. 
Therefore, measurements were acquired in each flow condition at 250kHz for a duration of 60s.

Even within the same startup of a flow condition, fluctuations of the flow can cause 
differences between separate measurements. Therefore, in order to isolate the effect of sampling 
frequency, the voltage signals measured with the conductivity probe at 250kHz were 
downsampled using a post-processing MATLAB script to obtain signals at 15 successively lower 
sampling frequencies (i.e. 125, 62.5, 50,…, 1.25, and 1kHz). Therefore, for each flow condition, 
16 sets of four-sensor conductivity probe signals at different sampling frequencies were obtained. 
These signals were each analyzed with the conductivity probe post-processing software (Kim et 

127 
 
al., 2000) to obtain the two-phase flow parameters based on the same physical measurement but 
at effectively different sampling frequencies. 
Figure 3-17 shows the dependence of the void fraction, bubble velocity, bubble number 
frequency, and interfacial area concentration on sampling frequency for the measurements 
performed at different gas flow rates at 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 4.00m/s. The values of the two-phase flow 
parameters based on the 250kHz signals, indicated by a subscript “250,” are used to normalize the 
parameters obtained from the signals that were downsampled to lower sampling frequencies. A 
sampling frequency is assumed to be adequate if a parameter obtained at that frequency is 
approximately within ±5% of the value based on the 250kHz signal.  
Overall, the measured void fraction demonstrated a weak dependence on the sampling 
frequency. For most of the flow conditions investigated, the void fraction remained within ±5% 
of the values at 250kHz for most of the sampling frequencies. However, as can be seen in Figure 
3-17(a), the void fractions in the lowest 〈𝑗𝑔〉 conditions for each 〈𝑗𝑓〉 demonstrated a stronger 
dependence on the sampling frequency than the other conditions with higher 〈𝑗𝑔〉. Moreover, with 
increasing 〈𝑗𝑓〉, higher sampling frequencies were required for the measured void fractions in the 
lowest 〈𝑗𝑔〉 conditions to converge to within ±5% of the measurements acquired at 250kHz.  For 
〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 1.00m/s, the void fraction was converged within ±5% by 10kHz. However for a similar 
〈𝑗𝑔〉 at 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 4.00m/s, about 30kHz was required to obtain the same level agreement in the 
measured void fractions. These observations can be explained by considering that the lowest 〈𝑗𝑔〉 
conditions are bubbly two-phase flows that contain numerous, dispersed, near-spherical and 
distorted bubbles. The relative uncertainties in the residence times of these small, dispersed 
bubbles are greater than the relative uncertainties in the residence times for the larger cap/slug 
bubbles that were present in the higher 〈𝑗𝑔〉 conditions. Therefore, the measured void fractions in 
the lowest 〈𝑗𝑔〉 conditions demonstrate a greater sensitivity to the sampling frequency.  Also, for a 

128 
 
given size bubble, its residence time decreases as the flow rate increases. Therefore, the bubbly 
two-phase flow conditions also require higher sampling frequencies with increasing 〈𝑗𝑓〉 to obtain 
converged void fraction measurements with respect to those acquired at 250kHz.     
The measured bubble velocity also demonstrated a weak dependence on sampling 
frequency. For sampling frequencies greater than approximately 10kHz, the bubble velocities 
remained well within ±5% of the values at 250kHz. Below 10kHz, the larger variations outside of 
±5% of the values at 250kHz can be attributed to inadequate representation of the bubble signal 
characteristics. This can lead to improper pairing of the signals from the upstream and 
downstream sensors and increased error in the corresponding time delays.  
Unlike the measured void fraction and bubble velocity, the measured bubble number 
frequency (𝑓𝑏) and interfacial area concentration demonstrated strong dependencies on the 
sampling frequency. Figures 3-17(c) and (d) show the variations of the bubble number frequency 
and interfacial area concentration, respectively, with sampling frequency. With increasing 〈𝑗𝑔〉 for 
a fixed 〈𝑗𝑓〉, it is observed that successively higher sampling frequencies are required to converge 
the bubble number frequency and interfacial area concentration measurements to within ±5% of 
the values at 250kHz. Since the bubble velocity measurements were found to converge similarly 
for each 〈𝑗𝑔〉, the behavior in the interfacial area concentration measurements is attributed to the 
stronger dependence of the bubble number frequency on sampling frequency. Two effects 
contribute to the observed behavior in the measured bubble number frequency with increasing 
〈𝑗𝑔〉. The first effect is that with increasing 〈𝑗𝑔〉, the bubble velocity increases. Higher velocities 
require higher sampling frequencies to accurately identify when the bubbles contact the probe 
sensors. The second effect is the changing interfacial structure. With increasing 〈𝑗𝑔〉, the flow 
transitions from a dispersed bubbly flow to a slug flow. In a slug flow, large slug bubbles are 
followed by densely packed regions of small bubbles. Higher sampling frequencies are required 

129 
 
to distinguish between the tightly packed small bubbles in these regions. A sampling frequency of 
at least 100kHz is required to converge the bubble number frequency and interfacial area 
concentration measurements within ±5% of the values at 250kHz for the highest 〈𝑗𝑔〉 condition 
shown in Figure 3-17.

3.2.3 Measurement Duration Sensitivity 
Measurement duration is another important parameter to consider when performing 
conductivity probe measurements. The measurement duration must be long enough in order to 
obtain a sufficient sample of bubbles that is representative of the characteristics of the flow to 
base the calculations of the average two-phase flow parameters on. However, other 
considerations, such as experiment time constraints and data storage limitations, preclude the use 
of arbitrarily long measurement durations. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of spherical 
bubbles hitting an ideal double-sensor probe, Wu and Ishii (1999) suggested that at least several 
thousand bubbles need to be measured to obtain a statistical uncertainty of ±7% in interfacial area 
concentration measurements. While this recommendation provides a rough guide to determining 
an appropriate measurement duration, Wu and Ishii’s (1999) study is an idealized approximation 
of bubbly two-phase flow. However, the four-sensor conductivity probe and its signal processing 
scheme are applicable to a wide range of two-phase flow conditions (Kim et al., 2000). Moreover, 
in the current conductivity probe signal processing scheme (Kim et al., 2000), bubbles are 
categorized into two groups according to their chord lengths. Group-I includes spherical and 
distorted bubbles, while group-II includes cap, slug, and churn-turbulent bubbles. The boundary 
between group-I and group-II is taken to be the maximum distorted bubble limit given by 
Equation [1-12]. Therefore, group-I, group-II, and total two-phase flow parameters are obtained 
from four-sensor conductivity probe measurements (Kim et al., 2000). Group-I bubbles typically 
greatly outnumber group-II bubbles in most two-phase flow conditions. Therefore, if bubble 
number alone is used to decide the measurement duration, the characteristics of the large bubbles 
may not be adequately captured. In view of this, it is instructive to investigate the sensitivity of 
the measured two-phase flow parameters for each bubble group to the measurement duration. 

131 
 
The conductivity probe measurements acquired in the 13 two-phase flow conditions 
listed in Table 3-2 were also used to investigate the sensitivity to the measurement duration. The 
conductivity probe signals, which were acquired with a measurement duration of 60s, were 
analyzed with the conductivity probe post-processing software for eight successively shorter 
durations (i.e. 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, 10, 5, and 1s). Thus, nine calculations of the two-phase flow 
parameters based on different durations of the signals were obtained for each flow condition. The 
two-phase flow parameters obtained from the full 60s signals, indicated by a subscript “60,” were 
used to normalize the two-phase flow parameters from the shorter portions of the signals.  
Figure 3-18 shows the measurement duration sensitivity results for the group-I and 
group-II void fractions and interfacial area concentrations for the different gas flow rates 
investigated at 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 3.00m/s. Figures 3-18(a) and (b) show the number of group-I and group-II 
bubbles, respectively, that were detected during each duration that was analyzed. These figures 
are included for reference to show the number of bubbles corresponding to each measurement 
duration. The strong linear trends indicate that the group bubble number frequencies (𝑓𝑏1 and 
𝑓𝑏2), were effectively constant for the different durations. Overall, the group-I and group-II void 
fractions and interfacial area concentrations are observed to be relatively insensitive to the 
measurement duration after a short period (less than approximately 10s)  for the present flow 
conditions, even with samples of less than 1,000 bubbles in some test conditions. This implies 
that as long as the measurements are made for a duration long enough to capture a collection of 
samples characteristic to a given two-phase flow system, neither a specific measurement duration 
nor number of bubbles dictates the statistical reliability of the data.  The lack of sensitivity to the 
measurement duration indicates that the time scales of the present flow conditions are relatively 
short.

3.2.4 Probe Sensor Orientation Effect 
During the course of the present investigation, several four-sensor conductivity probes 
were fabricated and tested. In a four-sensor conductivity probe, one of the upstream-downstream 
sensor pairs is selected to act as a double-sensor probe (Kim et al., 2000). The signals from this 
double-sensor probe are used to calculate the interfacial area concentration for bubbles that are 
characterized as spherical bubbles using the formulation for the interfacial area concentration 
given by Wu and Ishii (1999). The full four-sensor formulation for the interfacial area 
concentration (Kataoka et al., 1986) is used for bubbles classified as other than spherical (Kim et 
al., 2000). The double-sensor pair is also used to calculate the bubble velocities according to 
Equation [1-20]. It was observed that bubble velocity measurements acquired across the diameter 
of the pipe were asymmetric for some probes but not others in the same flow conditions. 
Therefore, a systematic investigation was performed to identify if the orientation of the double-
sensor pair with respect to the pipe wall, which was not the same amongst the probes, was the 
cause of the asymmetry.    
In a four-sensor conductivity probe, each upstream-downstream sensor pair has a 
different orientation with respect to the pipe wall. Considering each sensor pair as a separate 
double-sensor probe, three axial bubble velocities, calculated according to Equation [1-20], can 
be obtained from one four-sensor probe measurement. Therefore, the different sensor pairs of a 
four-sensor conductivity probe provide a convenient way to investigate the effects of the double-
sensor pair orientation on the measured bubble velocity. 
 
Figure 3-19(a) shows a conductivity probe installed in an instrumentation port in the 
vertical-upward two-phase flow test facility with a reference coordinate system. A four-sensor 
conductivity probe was carefully constructed such that the cross-section of the four sensors 
formed a square. The conductivity probe sensors are much smaller than the inner radius of the 

134 
 
instrumentation port (i.e. the inner pipe radius). Therefore, the curved wall as “seen” by the probe 
sensors can be regarded as a plane. Figures 3-19(b) and (c) schematically show how the different 
sensors of this probe were oriented with respect to the inner wall of the instrumentation port 
shown in Figure 3-19(a).  Sensor 0 is the upstream sensor, while sensors 1, 2, and 3 are the 
downstream sensors. The double-sensor probe formed by sensor pair 0-1 was oriented parallel to 
the wall, and the double-sensor probe formed by sensor pair 0-2 was oriented perpendicular to the 
wall. The double-sensor probe formed by sensor pair 0-3 was oriented at 45° to the wall.

135 
 
Measurements performed with this four-sensor conductivity probe at P1 (L=18D) in a 
two-phase flow condition with 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 2.61m/s and 〈𝑗𝑔〉 = 1.0m/s were selected to study the bubble 
velocities measured by the separate sensor pairs. This flow condition was selected because it 
contained both group-I and group-II bubbles, allowing investigation into the effects of the sensor 
pair orientations on the measured bubble velocities for each group. The conductivity probe was 
traversed from r/R=+0.9 to r/R=-0.9 in increments of 0.1 to assess the symmetry of the measured 
parameters; refer to Figure 3-19 for which side of the pipe corresponds to the ±r/R coordinates. 
The signals obtained with each sensor pair were analyzed with the conductivity probe 
post-processing software to obtain three separate measured bubble velocities  for group-I and 
group-II bubbles. The calculation of the group bubble velocities is the same as given by Equation 
[1-20], except that the average is only performed over the number of effective bubbles in each 
group (i.e. 𝑁𝑒𝑓𝑓,1 and  𝑁𝑒𝑓𝑓,2) instead of the total number of effective bubbles. Figure 3-20 shows 
the measured bubble velocities obtained from each sensor pair for group-I and group-II bubbles. 
In the figures, the measured bubble velocities are plotted against the absolute value of r/R in order 
to compare the symmetry of the measurements acquired at the ±r/R locations. The solid and open 
symbols are measurements acquired at the +r/R and –r/R locations, respectively. 
Figures 3-20(a) and (b) show that the group-I and group-II bubble velocity measurements 
based on sensor pair 0-1 that was oriented parallel to the wall are very symmetric. However, as 
can be seen in Figures 3-20(c)-(f) the bubble velocity measurements based on the other sensor 
pairs demonstrate noticeable asymmetry. The measured bubble velocities based on sensor pairs 0-
2 and 0-3 are systematically lower for the –r/R points compared to the +r/R points. The group-I 
bubble velocity measurements at corresponding ±r/R points generally agree with each other 
within ±10%. However, the degree of asymmetry for the group-II bubble velocities is much more 
considerable; the largest deviation at r/R=±0.9 is greater that 1m/s. The observed asymmetry is 
significant because it is outside the ±10% uncertainty that is typically reported for conductivity 
probe measurements (Kim et al., 2000; Le Corre et al., 2003; Manera et al., 2009).

To understand the cause of the asymmetries in the measured bubble velocities obtained 
from the different sensor pairs, consider the schematic shown in Figure 3-21 of a bubble moving 
vertically upwards with velocity 𝑣𝑏 towards a double-sensor probe. Figures 3-21(a) and (b) show 
the bubble hitting the probe at opposite positions on the bubble surface. Due to the lateral 
separation of the probe sensors and the shape and orientation of the bubble interface with respect 
to the probe, the measured velocity in the situation depicted in Figure 3-21(a) (𝑣𝑔,𝑎) will 
underestimate the actual bubble velocity. Conversely, the measured velocity in the situation 
depicted in Figure 3-21(b) (𝑣𝑔,𝑏) will overestimate the actual bubble velocity. 
 
 
 
(a) 
(b) 
Figure 3-21: Schematic of double-sensor probe orientation with respect to a bubble that leads to 
measured bubble velocities that (a) underestimate and (b) overestimate the actual bubble velocity. 
 For small, dispersed group-I bubbles, these effects will approximately cancel in the 
average over many individual bubble velocity measurements, since the dispersed bubbles can 
move freely and impact the probe at any point on their surfaces. It is noted that at r/R positions 
closer to the wall, however, the bubbles may be preferentially sampled on one side or the other. 

138 
 
This may explain the growing asymmetry in the group-I bubble velocities for pairs 0-2 and 0-3 at 
points closer to the wall. 
The lateral motion of larger group-II bubbles is restricted by the pipe. Therefore, at a 
given point in the pipe cross-section, the probe is likely to measure similar points on the group-II 
bubble surfaces. Thus, the average group-II bubble velocity measurements at a given point are 
more strongly affected by how the probe sensors are oriented with respect to the group-II bubble 
interface. Therefore, in view of Figure 3-21 and the current sensor orientations, group-II bubble 
velocities based on sensor pairs 0-2 and 0-3 are overestimated at the +r/R points and 
underestimated at the –r/R points. Since sensor pair 0-1 is parallel to the pipe wall, it penetrates 
the group-II bubble interfaces similarly at both ±r/R points. This yields more symmetric group-II 
bubble velocity measurements across the pipe diameter.   
Table 3-3 shows the volumetric gas fluxes based on the local conductivity probe 
measurements discussed in Figure 3-20. The area-average of the local 𝛼 and 𝑣𝑔 measurements is 
performed in three ways: 1) using measurements at only +r/R points, 2) using measurements at 
only –r/R points, and 3) using measurements at both ±r/R points. For the first two methods, the 
measurements on either radius are assumed to be axisymmetric throughout the entire cross-
section. For the third method, the –r/R points are assumed to be axisymmetric in one half of the 
cross-section, and the +r/R points are assumed to be axisymmetric in the other half. The area-
averaging method is discussed in Appendix A. The local void fraction measurements in this 
condition were very symmetric across the diameter for both group-I and group-II bubbles. 
Therefore, the differences between the volumetric gas fluxes calculated with the different sets of 
points directly reflect the asymmetries observed in the measured bubble velocities in Figure 3-20. 
It is observed that even though the volumetric gas fluxes calculated based on sensor pair 0-3 are 
different depending on which set of points is used to calculate the area-average, all three 
estimates compare better with 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 calculated based on the gas rotameter and pressure 

139 
 
measurements. It can also be seen in Figure 3-20 that the bubble velocities measurements are 
consistently higher for sensor pair 0-3. This may be another sensor geometry effect, since sensor 
pair 0-3 has a larger lateral spacing compared to the other two sensor pairs.    
Since vertical-upward two-phase flows in round pipes are typically assumed to be 
axisymmetric, measurements are often only performed along a single radius. Therefore, it is 
important not to introduce artificial asymmetries into the measurements that can arise due to 
sensor orientation as demonstrated in this study. Thus, in view of these findings, it is 
recommended that the double-sensor pair used to determine the bubble velocities should be 
oriented parallel to pipe wall.

3.3 Experiments in Bubbly to Cap-Bubbly Transition Flows 
Having improved the conductivity probe measurement system, an experimental 
investigation into cap-bubbly transition two-phase flows was performed to establish an 
experimental database that highlights the transition from one-group to two-group flows and to 
identify the signatures of group transition. A scoping study was performed to identify when 

140 
 
group-II bubbles became present in the flow in order to identify flow conditions for further 
investigation. The scoping study is discussed in Section 3.3.1. The one-group to two-group 
transition test conditions that were selected are discussed in Section 3.3.2. The reliability of the 
experimental data is assessed in Section 3.3.3. The trends observed in the local and area-averaged 
two-phase flow parameters are discussed in Section 3.3.4.        
3.3.1 Scoping Study 
To identify flow conditions where group-II bubbles became present in the flow, a scoping 
study was performed that combined high-speed flow visualization and conductivity probe 
measurements at P2 (L=34.5D) and P3 (L=63D). Figure 3-22 shows the 27 flow conditions that 
were investigated during the scoping study. The test conditions are shown on the conventional 
vertical-upward flow regime map of Mishima and Ishii (1984). Following the approach of 
Mishima and Ishii (1984) for the transition boundary between bubbly and slug flow, the line of 
void fraction equal to 0.15 is also included in the figure for reference. Table 3-4 provides the 
superficial liquid and gas velocities for the flow conditions that were investigated. The subscript 
“34.5D” on 〈𝑗𝑔〉 indicates that the value was evaluated from the gas rotameter readings, back 
pressure at the exit of the rotameters, and the pressure measured at P2 (L=34.5D). Also, the area-
averaged total void fraction and the ratio of area-averaged group-II void fraction to area-averaged 
total void fraction based on the local conductivity probe measurements performed at P2 
(L=34.5D) are included in the table. These parameters provide an indication of the relative 
importance of group-II bubbles in the flow conditions investigated. 
Since the objective of the scoping study was to obtain a basic sense of the flow structure 
with progressively increasing gas flow rates to identify flow conditions for further investigation, a 
relatively sparse measurement mesh was used for the local conductivity probe measurements in 

141 
 
the scoping study. Figure 3-23 shows the measurement mesh in the pipe cross-section that was 
used. The probe was traversed across one radius of the pipe starting at r/R=0.9 and moving 
towards the center. A measurement point was included at r/R=0.8 in order to capture the gradients 
in the two-phase flow parameters near the pipe wall. Beyond r/R=0.8 the probe was traversed in 
increments of r/R=0.2 to the pipe center. Spot check measurements were also typically performed 
at r/R=-0.6 and -0.8 after acquiring the measurement at the pipe center to assess the symmetry of 
the flow. Even though the measurement mesh used during the scoping study is somewhat coarse, 
it can still be used to obtain area-averaged two-phase flow parameters. The method used to area-
average the local conductivity probe measurements is discussed in Appendix A. At each radial 
position, conductivity probe measurements were acquired for 60s with a sampling frequency of 
50kHz. The complete set of experimental data, including pressure measurements and local 
conductivity probe measurements, acquired during the scoping study is presented in Appendix B.

Figure 3-23: Conductivity probe measurement mesh in the pipe cross-section for scoping study 
test conditions; the flow direction is out of the page. 
Figure 3-24 shows some characteristic images of the two-phase flow structure at the 
initiation of transition from a one-group to two-group flow that were acquired during the scoping 
study. Figure 3-24(a) shows an example of a purely one-group flow where only near spherical 
and distorted bubbles exist dispersed throughout the cross-section. With an increase in gas flow 
rate, larger group-I bubbles are observed in the flow. Moreover, intermittent cap-bubbles are 
observed with smaller group-I bubbles following in their wakes. This presents a noticeable flow 
structure, as the cap-bubbles travel up the pipe faster than the surrounding smaller bubbles. 
Additionally, clusters of smaller bubbles appear that behave in a similar fashion as the larger cap-
shaped bubbles in regards to their motion up the pipe. An example of this beginning stage of one-
group to two-group transition is shown in Figure 3-24(b). As the gas flow rate is increased 
further, larger cap-bubbles are present in the flow that begin to fill the pipe cross-section and 
elongate. An example of a such a larger cap-bubble is shown in Figure 3-24(c) with group-I 
bubbles trailing behind it in its wake. With a continuing increases in gas flow rate, the cap-bubbly 
flow structure transitions into an established group-II flow structure resembling a prototypic slug 
flow.  As the transition progresses, large cap-bubbles that elongate but do not fill the pipe cross--1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.40.60.81.0

section exist intermittently with elongated slug bubbles that fill the pipe cross-section. Eventually, 
a characteristic slug flow is established with alternating regions of well-formed slug bubbles and 
liquid slugs that resemble a prototypic bubbly flow.

m/s and 〈𝑗𝑔〉34.5𝐷 = 0.30 m/s). The still images are from high-speed videos captured at 2000fps at 
L=63D during the scoping study. 
In the conductivity probe signal processing scheme (Kim et al., 2000), bubbles are 
categorized as either group-I or group-II bubbles according to the chord length that is measured 
when a bubble hits the probe. The boundary between group-I and group-II bubbles is taken to be 
the maximum distorted bubble limit given by Ishii and Zuber (1979), which is approximately 
10mm for air-water flows near ambient pressure. Thus, bubbles with measured chord lengths less 

145 
 
than 10mm are classified as group-I bubbles, while bubbles with measured chord lengths greater 
than 10mm are classified as group-II bubbles. Additional details about the bubble categorization 
scheme can be found in the references (Kim et al., 2000; Fu, 2001; Bernard, 2014). 
It is possible that a  cap bubble could be mischaracterized as a group-I bubble if the probe 
measures a chord length near its edge. This can be important at the initiation of transition where 
group-II bubbles are first formed. Therefore, to assess the efficacy of the bubble characterization 
scheme in one-group to two-group transition conditions, the number of group-I and group-II 
bubbles detected by the conductivity probe at the center of the pipe r/R=0.0 is studied in 
comparison to the characterization of the flow regime through high-speed visualization. The 
center of the pipe is investigated because group-II bubbles and larger group-I bubbles are first 
observed to appear there in the flow visualizations. For the purposes of this analysis, as long as a 
group-II bubble is detected, the flow is categorized as a two-group flow. Table 3-5 and 3-6 show 
the comparisons of the characterizations of the flow structure at P2 (L=34.5D) and P3 (L=63D), 
respectively. In general, the conductivity probe measurements demonstrate good agreement with 
the flow visualization results in identifying when larger group-II (i.e. cap bubbles) are present in 
the flow. This indicates that the chord length criterion used to classify group-I and group-II 
bubbles is an appropriate indicator of when larger bubbles are present in the flow.  
It is noted that the conductivity probe signal processing software accounts for the 
possibility of a group-II bubble being characterized as a group-I bubble through a statistical 
correction based on the relative numbers of group-I and group-II bubbles that are detected. 
Details about this correction are given by Fu (2001). Moreover, even if group-II bubbles are 
mischaracterized as group-I bubbles, this does not significantly affect the measurement of total 
void fraction and interfacial area concentration since the number of small group-I bubbles is 
significantly greater than the number group-II bubbles, as can be seen in Tables 3-5 and 3-6.

3.3.2 One-Group to Two-Group Transition Test Conditions 
Based on the observations of the scoping study, flow conditions were selected for further 
investigation into the transition from one-group to two-group flows. Figure 3-25 shows the nine 
two-phase flow conditions that were selected along with the flow conditions previously 
investigated by Fu (2001) in a similar size test section. The test conditions are shown on the 
conventional vertical-upward flow regime map of Mishima and Ishii (1984). Following the 
approach of Mishima and Ishii (1984) for the transition boundary between bubbly and slug flow, 
the line of void fraction equal to 0.15 is also included in the figure for reference. The existing 
experimental database that was used to establish a two-group interfacial area transport equation 
model for moderate diameter pipes covers a wide range of two-phase flow conditions (Fu, 2001). 
However, there are a limited number of conditions with low group-II concentration where the 
initiation of group transition would occur. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to focus 
on the transition region between the conventional bubbly and slug flow regimes. Specifically, it is 
essential to study the cap-bubbly flows that occur in this region, as this is where the bubble 
interactions that cause the transition from purely one-group to two-group flows are dominant. 
Table 3-7 provides the superficial liquid and gas velocities for the flow conditions that 
were investigated. The subscript “18D” on 〈𝑗𝑔〉 indicates that the value was evaluated from the 
gas rotameter readings, back pressure at the exit of the rotameters, and the pressure measured at 
P1 (L=18D). Also, the area-averaged total void fraction and the ratio of the area-averaged group-
II void fraction to area-averaged total void fraction based on the local conductivity probe 
measurements performed at P1 (L=18D) are also included in the table. These provide an 
indication of the relative importance of group-II bubbles in the flow conditions investigated.  Run 
1 was chosen as a baseline one-group flow condition where no group-II bubbles were observed. 
The local measurements obtained in Runs 1-4 are discussed in Section 3.3.4.1, as they show the 

149 
 
progressive generation and growth of larger bubbles in cap-bubbly flow with increasing gas flow 
rate. Similar trends to those observed in Runs 1-4 were found in Runs 7 and 8 as well. Runs 5, 6, 
and 9 are more established two-group flows that contain group-II bubbles that fill the pipe cross-
section and have lengths greater than one pipe diameter; this was confirmed through high-speed 
flow visualization as well as with the chord length measurements obtained with the conductivity 
probe. Runs 5, 6, and 9 also still contain intermittent cap-shaped bubbles that do not completely 
fill the pipe cross-section. The primary focus of this dissertation is on the initiation of the 
transition from one-group to two-group flows. However, Runs 5, 6, and 9 were selected to study 
the continuous development into more established two-group flows. The local measurements for 
Runs 5 and 6 are also discussed in Section 3.3.4.1.

Conductivity probe measurements were performed at each of the four measurement ports 
for Runs 1-4. However, the measurements at P0 (7.5D) were found to be subject to inlet effects. 
Therefore, the measurements at this location are disregarded, and measurements were not 
performed at this location in the remainder of the flow conditions that were studied. Figure 3-26 
shows the measurement mesh in the pipe cross-section that was used for the conductivity probe 
measurements. The probe was traversed across the diameter of the pipe in non-dimensional radial 
increments of r/R=0.1. Measurements were acquired across the entire diameter of the pipe in 
Runs 1-4 to confirm symmetry of the flow. In the remaining conditions, only the +r/R points were 
measured at every r/R=0.1, and spot check measurements at r/R=-0.4 and -0.8 were performed to 
confirm symmetry. During the experiments, the probe was systematically traversed from r/R = 
+0.9 to r/R = -0.9 in order to minimize backlash error from the linear traverse in the probe 
positioning. At each radial position, conductivity probe measurements were acquired for 60s with 
a sampling frequency of 50kHz. The complete set of experimental data, including pressure 

151 
 
measurements and local conductivity probe measurements, acquired during in the one-group to 
two-group transition test conditions is presented in Appendix C.

3.3.3 Reliability of Experimental Data 
3.3.3.1 Experimental Procedures  
 
A systematic experimental procedure was followed when performing conductivity probe 
measurements, which is summarized as follows: 
 
1. Calibrate the conductivity probe position from the inner wall of the instrumentation port 
and install in the test section. 
2. Connect the impulse line to the differential pressure transmitter and the pressure tap at 
instrumentation port. 
3. Set up single-phase liquid flow and ensure that no bubbles are present in the test section.

4. Bleed the impulse line and differential pressure transmitter to ensure that no air is trapped 
in the line or transmitter. 
5. Set 〈𝑗𝑓〉  to approximately 0.25 m/s higher than the desired value. 
6. Set the gas flow rate at the gas rotameters 50cfh higher than the desired value and allow 
the flow to run for 5 minutes. 
7. Slowly reduce the gas flow rate to the desired value. 
8. Iteratively adjust the gas and liquid flow rates until the desired values are achieved. Once 
the desired values are achieved, allow the flow to run for 5 minutes before performing 
measurements to ensure that the flow condition has stabilized. Continuously check the 
gas and liquid flow rates throughout the experiment and perform minor adjustments, if 
necessary, to maintain the specified values. Wait at least one minute after making any 
adjustments before continuing measurements.  
9. Acquire 20 readings of pressure and liquid flow rate each averaged over 20s. 
10. Position conductivity probe at desired r/R location. Traverse to the r/R location in the 
same direction that was used to calibrate the probe position from the inner wall of the 
instrumentation port to minimize backlash error. 
11. Acquire conductivity probe signals for 60s with a sampling frequency of 50kHz. 
12. Repeat traversing probe and acquiring signals until all points have been measured. 
13. After completing conductivity probe measurements at all r/R locations, move the 
conductivity probe back to r/R=0.0 and repeat the measurement to confirm repeatability.  
3.3.3.2 Volumetric Gas Flux Benchmark and Consistency Assessment 
 
As discussed in Section 3.2.1.2, to assess the reliability of the conductivity probe 
measurements, the volumetric gas flux calculated from the conductivity probe measurements (i.e. 

153 
 
〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧) is benchmarked against the volumetric gas flux obtained from the gas rotameters and 
pressure measurements (i.e. 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧) given by Equation 3-2. This comparison compares local and 
global measurement techniques for obtaining the volumetric gas flux at each axial location along 
the test section. Figure 3-27 compares 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧 to 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧. 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧 underestimates 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 with an 
average difference of -12%, which is considered acceptable in view of the accuracies of the 
conductivity probe, pressure transducer, back pressure dial gauge, and gas rotameters. 
 
Figure 3-27: Volumetric gas flux benchmark of conductivity probe measurements for one-group 
to two-group transition test conditions.  
In addition to the volumetric gas flux benchmark, the consistency of the conductivity 
probe measurements is assessed by comparing the 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉 values acquired at the different 
instrumentation ports. Along with the measured pressures at each port, estimates of 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉 at P1 
(L=18D) are calculated from the values of 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉 obtained at P2 (L=34.5D) and P3 (L=63D) as:

Figure 3-28 shows the comparison of 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉18𝐷,𝑧 to 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉18𝐷,18𝐷. Here, the first subscript 
on 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉 indicates that the value corresponds to the P1 (L=18D) location, and the second 
subscript indicates the location of the measurement port that was used to calculate it. Hence, 
〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉18𝐷,18𝐷 is the value for P1 (L=18D) obtained from the measurements at P1 (L=18D), and 
〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉18𝐷,34.5𝐷 is the value for P1 (L=18D) calculated from the conductivity probe measurements 
at P2 (L=34.5D). In general, very good agreement is observed among the measurements at each 
port for each condition with an average difference of ±4%. This confirms consistency in setting 
the flow condition and conductivity probe performance during the measurements at the different 
instrumentation ports.

3.3.3.3 Symmetry of Local Two-Phase Flow Parameters 
In vertical-upward two-phases flows in round pipes, it is commonly assumed that the 
distribution of local two-phase flow parameters is axisymmetric. If the distribution is not 
axisymmetric, however, this assumption can lead to significant errors in calculating the area-
averaged two-phase flow parameters based on measurements acquired along only a single radius. 
Therefore, the rotating instrumentation ports located at 18D and 63D from the two-phase flow 
inlet are used to confirm that the local two-phase flow parameters are indeed axisymmetric in the 
pipe cross-section. Figure 3-29 shows the conductivity probe measurement mesh in the pipe 
cross-section that was used to assess the axi-symmetry of the flow using the rotating 
instrumentation ports. In view of previous benchmark studies (Kim et al., 2000; Le Corre et al., 
2003; Manera et al., 2009) and the volumetric gas flux benchmark and consistency assessment 
discussed in Section 3.3.3.2, ±10% error bars are included on the two-phase flow parameters 
measured by the conductivity probe. Measurements were acquired along the different diameters 
during the same flow condition without stopping the flow by rotating the instrumentation port to 
the different angles. Figure 3-30 shows a comparison of the local void fraction and interfacial 
area concentrations acquired along the 0° and 90° angles at P1 (L=18D) for the bubbly flow 
condition Run 1. To ensure that the flow remained axisymmetric with increasing gas flow rate, 
the symmetry of Run 6 was also checked with measurements along the 0°, 45°, and 90° angles at 
P1 (L=18D). Figure 3-31 compares the local measurements of the total, group-I, and group-II 
void fractions and interfacial area concentrations acquired along those three angles. In general, 
strong symmetry is observed in all of the measured two-phase flow parameters. This confirms 
that acquiring measurements along a single diameter or even a single radius is sufficient to obtain 
an accurate representation of the flow and to compute area-averaged two-phase flow parameters 
in the present experiments.

3.3.4 Experimental Results and Discussion 
3.3.4.1 Local Two-Phase Flow Parameters 
It is well known that the transverse void fraction distribution is dependent on bubble size 
(Liu, 1993, Tomiyama et al., 2002). Therefore, significant changes in the transverse distribution 
of local two-phase flow parameters are expected in the transition from one-group to two-group 
flows. Based on a large set of experimental data, Serizawa and Kataoka (1988) identified three 
basic transverse void fraction distributions: wall-peaked, intermediate-peaked, and center-peaked. 
Other distributions that occur can be considered as a combination of these three. These various 
distributions result from the migration of bubbles within the cross-section due to the net 
transverse force on the bubbles. The net transverse force can be the resultant of several forces 
including the shear-induced lift force (Auton, 1987), wall lubrication force (Antal et al., 1991), 
and turbulent dispersion force (Lahey et al., 1993). 
Figures 3-32(a) and (b) show the axial evolution from P1 (L=18D) to P3 (L=63D) of the 
local void fraction and interfacial area concentration for Run 1. This condition is a purely one-
group flow; no group-II bubbles were detected in the measurements. This was also confirmed 
through high-speed flow visualization. Therefore, the total and group-I two-phase flow 
parameters are equivalent in this condition. At P0 (L=7.5D), not shown in the figure, the 
distributions of void fraction and interfacial area concentration were center-peaked due to the 
inlet effect; this was the case for all flow conditions investigated. By 18D in Run 1, both the void 
fraction and interfacial area concentration developed into a wall-peaked profile. The wall-peak 
continuously increased along the test section as the bubbles moved towards the wall from the 
center of the pipe. Wall-peaked profiles have been observed in many previous studies in bubbly 
flow and are attributed to the transverse lift force on the bubbles (Liu, 1993; Tomiyama et al., 

159 
 
2002). Similar void and interfacial area concentration profiles is a characteristic of dispersed  
bubbly flow.

concentration for Run 1 (〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 2.00 m/s and 〈𝑗𝑔〉18𝐷 = 0.18 m/s). 
Figure 3-33(a) shows the total void fraction profiles for Run 2. This condition consisted 
of predominately group-I bubbles, but some Group-II bubbles were present. The group-II void 
fraction profiles were center-peaked and continuously increased along the test section with local 
values less than about 0.01. Based on flow visualization, this condition is regarded as a bubbly 
flow with intermittent, larger cap-shaped bubbles that do not fill the pipe; it is far from a 
prototypical slug flow. Therefore, this condition represents the initial stages of a two-group flow.

 The total and group-I void fractions exhibit a combination of the wall- and center-peaked 
distributions, which was designated as a transition distribution between bubbly and slug flow by 
Serizawa and Kataoka (Serizawa and Kataoka, 1988). Such a transition distribution is anticipated 
with an increase in gas flow rate from a wall-peaked condition, such as Run 1, before a fully 
center-peaked profile is attained. It has been observed in previous studies that beyond a certain 
size, bubbles tend to move towards the center of the pipe (Liu, 1993; Tomiyama et al., 2002). The 
migration of these larger bubbles will reduce the degree of peaking at the wall and produce a 
central peak. The larger bubbles in the center of the pipe may entrain smaller ones in their wake 
region, which also contributes to the central peaking. However, the smaller bubbles still have a 
tendency to move towards the wall, which yields the increasing wall-peaks shown in the figure.  
Interestingly, the interfacial area concentration profiles for Run 2, shown in Figure 3-
33(b), are flatter in the center compared to the void fraction profiles. The few larger bubbles that 
reside near the center contribute less interfacial area concentration than numerous smaller bubbles 
that migrate towards the walls. Therefore, the central peak is less pronounced in the interfacial

area concentration profiles. The difference in the shapes of the void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration profiles is indicative of a transition from a purely dispersed bubbly flow. 
With a further increase in the gas flow rate, the wall-peaking is completely eliminated, as 
is shown by the center-peaked total void fraction profile for Run 3 in Figure 3-34(a). However, 
this flow condition is still observed to be a cap-bubbly flow. Larger and more frequent cap-
shaped bubbles are observed in comparison to Run 2, but a characteristic slug flow is not 
observed. Figures 3-35(a) and (b) show the group-I and group-II void fraction profiles. The 
summation of the local group void fractions at a given point yields the total void fraction at that 
point. Although a significant amount of group-II void is found at 18D, it remains relatively 
unchanged by 34.5D. However, significant growth in the group-II void is observed between 
34.5D and 63D. The growth is primarily in the center of the pipe. This growth coincides with a 
depression in the group-I void profile near the center of the pipe. It is observed in the flow 
visualizations that bubbles cluster in the wakes of the larger cap bubbles. Entrainment and 
subsequent coalescence of these bubbles is a major mechanism that drives the transition. 
Even though the total interfacial area concentration, shown in Figure 3-34(b), is center-
peaked, it is flatter near the center of the pipe compared to the void fraction due to the presence of 
larger bubbles in this portion of the cross-section. Furthermore, wall-peaking in the interfacial 
area concentration is not observed to develop as in Run 2. This supports the idea that the larger 
bubbles in the center of the pipe entrain the smaller bubbles, which contribute the most to the

and 3 were also observed in Runs 7 and 8 at the lower liquid flow rate.

Figure 3-36 shows the axial evolution of the group-I void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration for the more established two-group flow condition Run 5. Although larger 
elongated group-II bubbles are present in this condition, it is still regarded as a cap-bubbly flow 
instead of a more prototypic slug flow since smaller cap-bubbles that do not fill the pipe cross-
section are also still present in the flow. An interesting feature of the group-I void fraction and

interfacial area concentration profiles is the development of a peak around r/R=±0.5. This 
indicates that there is an accumulation of group-I bubbles at this location. This could be related to 
the wake structure behind the larger cap/slug bubbles that is entraining the group-I bubbles to this 
location. Alternatively, this may indicate the production of group-I bubbles due to shearing-off. T 
large increase in group-I interfacial area concentration between 34.5D and 63D suggests the 
latter.

Figure 3-37 shows the group-II void fraction and interfacial area concentration for Run5. 
The group-II void fraction is the dominant component of the total void fraction and is strongly 
center-peaked. While the group-II void fraction profile does not change significantly between 
34.5D and 63D, there is a noticeable decrease in the group-II interfacial area concentration 
towards the center of cross-section between these locations. This also corresponds to a decrease 
in the group-II bubble number frequency.  These observations suggest active coalescence of the 
group-II bubbles with each other as the flow develops. Similar trends to those in Figures 3-36 and 
3-37 are observed for Runs 6 and 9, as well.

Figure 3-38 compares the local group-I Sauter-mean diameter (𝐷𝑆𝑚1) profiles for Runs 1-
6. In Run 1, Figure 3-38(a), 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 is relatively constant across the pipe, and very similar profiles 
are observed at 18D and 34.5D. A slight increase is observed by 63D, and distinct peaking at the 
center and around r/R=±0.8 is observed. This may suggest that larger group-I bubbles begin to 
form in the densely packed wall-peaked region and then move to the center of the pipe. The 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 
for Run 2, Figure 3-38(b), are strongly center-peaked and noticeably increase along the pipe, 
suggesting active coalescence. The strongly center-peaked profile observed for Run 2 is one of 
the signatures of the group transition and indicates that the formation of group-II bubbles occurs 
in the center of the pipe. The 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 maintain center-peaked profiles in Runs 3 and 4, but the 
profiles are broader compared to Run 2. Also, while the 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 tends to increase, particularly near 
the center, along the pipe in Runs 1 and 2, the values decrease along the pipe for Runs 3 and 4. 
This suggests transfer from group-I to group-II and that the group-I bubble size decreases as the 
transition progresses. A further decrease in group-I Sauter mean diameter is observed in the more 
established two-group flow conditions, Runs 5 and 6. The 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 profiles remain center-peaked in 
these conditions, but the profile is broader compared to the other conditions.

3.3.4.2 One-Dimensional Two-Phase Flow Parameters 
The local two-phase flow parameters measured with the conductivity probe are area-
averaged to obtain one-dimensional two-phase flow parameters at each axial location. To do so, 
the parameters are assumed to be axisymmetric within the cross-section. This assumption is 
supported by the strong symmetry observed in the local data acquired at the ±r/R points and at 
different azimuthal angles as discussed in Section 3.3.3.3. The local measurements are 
numerically integrated using the composite Simpson’s rule (Stewart, 2007) to obtain the area-
averaged values of total, group-I, and group-II parameters. Details about the area-averaging 
method are discussed in Appendix A. 
Figure 3-39(a) shows the axial development of the area-averaged total void fraction (〈𝛼〉) 
for Runs 1-4. 〈𝛼〉 is observed to increase linearly along the pipe with very nearly the same slope 
for each condition. Figure 3-39(b) shows the development of the group-I and group-II void 
fractions (〈𝛼1〉 and 〈𝛼2〉) along the test section for Runs 1-4. As with the local void fractions, the 
sum of 〈𝛼1〉 and 〈𝛼2〉 equals 〈𝛼〉. Run 1 contains no 〈𝛼2〉. The 〈𝛼2〉 for Run 2 is minimal along the 
entire pipe, but the values do increase slightly by the last port, indicating growth. A clear 
exchange between the group voids is observed in Run 3 between 34.5 and 63D. A similar 
exchange is also observed between 18 and 34.5D for Run 4. It is interesting to note that the slopes 
of 〈𝛼1〉 before and after the exchanges in Runs 3 and 4, respectively, are similar to those in Runs 
1 and 2. 
Figures 3-40(a) and (b) show the axial development of the area-averaged total (〈𝑎𝑖〉) and 
group (〈𝑎𝑖1〉 and 〈𝑎𝑖2〉)  interfacial area concentrations, respectively, for Runs 1-4. For Runs 1 and 
2, 〈𝑎𝑖〉 increases linearly along the pipe, and between these two runs there is an overall increase in 
the interfacial area concentration. For Run 3, 〈𝑎𝑖〉 and 〈𝑎𝑖1〉 increase along the pipe. However, 
their slopes decrease between 34.5D and 63D. Correspondingly, 〈𝑎𝑖2〉 increases between these 

167 
 
locations. This suggests an exchange between the groups due to coalescence interactions. 
Furthermore, the interfacial area concentration decreased overall in comparison to Run 2, which 
is consistent with the presence of larger bubbles in this higher gas flow rate condition. Likewise, 
the interfacial area concentration for Run 4 is lower overall than Runs 2 and 3. In Run 4, 〈𝑎𝑖〉 and 
〈𝑎𝑖1〉 increase along the pipe. However, the slopes between 18D and 34.5D are less than those 
between 34.5D and 63D. 〈𝑎𝑖2〉 is observed to increase between 18D and 34.5D and then remain 
constant. These trends may indicate that a balance is being established between competing 
breakup and coalescence processes of group-II bubbles. 
Figure 3-41 shows the development of the total and group area-averaged void fractions 
for Runs 7 and 8. Likewise, Figure 3-42 shows the development of the total and group area-
averaged interfacial area concentrations for Runs 7 and 8. There is a marked exchange between 
the group void fractions in these lower liquid flow rate conditions as can be seen in Figure 3-
41(b). This corresponds to the significant decreases in the total and group-I interfacial area 
concentrations observed in Figure 3-42. These conditions clearly indicate that intergroup 
coalescence is occurring in these conditions.  
Figure 3-43 and 3-44 show the area-averaged void fractions and interfacial area 
concentrations, respectively, for Runs 5 and 6. In discussing Run 4, it was pointed out that a 
balance between group-II bubble breakup and coalescence processes appeared to be establishing. 
Runs 5 and 6 clearly demonstrate that a breakup process is now active due to the noticeable 
increase in total and group-I interfacial area concentration along the pipe. It is likely that the 
shearing-off mechanism has become important in these more established flow conditions since 
elongated group-II bubbles are present. Additionally, the decreasing area-averaged group-II 
interfacial area concentration suggests active intragroup coalescence of group-II bubbles. This is 
consistent with the earlier discussion of the local measurements for Run 5. Similar trends are 
observed in the area-averaged measurements for Run 9 shown in Figures 3-45 and 3-46.

3.4 Chapter Summary 
The experimental portion of this work consists of two major efforts: 1) systematic 
investigation into practical aspects of the conductivity probe measurement system to improve the 
conductivity probe measurement technique and 2) establishing an experimental database in 
vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow that highlights one-group to two-group transition. The 
major findings of the investigation into the conductivity probe measurement system are 
summarized as: 
 
 
Signal ghosting causes artificially high bubble velocity measurements and low interfacial 
area concentration measurements that depend on sampling frequency and sensor 
impedance. A revised electrical circuit that incorporates a voltage follower to reduce the 
source impedances of the conductivity probe sensors was suggested to eliminate this 
artificial variability. The characteristics of signal ghosting and the performance of the 
revised circuit were investigated experimentally with a novel dual double-sensor 
conductivity probe. 
 
 
Sensitivity of the measured two-phase flow parameters to data acquisition sampling 
frequency was investigated in 13 vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow conditions 
spanning the bubbly and slug flow regimes. Measurements acquired with a sampling 
frequency of 250kHz are downsampled to subsequently lower sampling frequencies to 
isolate the effect of sampling frequency. The measured void fraction and bubble velocity 
were found to be relatively insensitive to sampling frequency. However, for a given 
liquid flow rate, it was observed that with increasing gas flow rate, higher sampling 
frequencies are required to obtain bubble number frequency and interfacial area 
concentration measurements that are within ±5% of the 250kHz measurements. This 

177 
 
trend is due to both the increase in gas velocity and the transition to the slug flow regime 
with increasing gas flow rate. The highest combination of gas and liquid flow rates 
studied indicates that sampling frequencies greater than 100kHz may be required to 
adequately capture all of the measured two-phase flow parameters. 
 
 
The effect of measurement duration was investigated with the same set of conductivity 
probe measurements used in the sampling frequency sensitivity study by processing 
successively shorter durations of the full 60s signals. The measurements for both group-I 
and group-II bubbles were observed to be insensitive to the measurement duration and 
the number of bubbles, as long as the measurements are made for a duration long enough 
to capture a collection of samples characteristic to a given two-phase flow system. 
 
 
It is recommended that sensitivity studies on sampling frequency and measurement 
duration be implemented as part of data acquisition quality control practices to identify 
the appropriate sampling frequency and measurement duration for the flow conditions of 
interest. 
 
 
In regards to probe sensor orientation, it was found that orienting a double-sensor probe 
perpendicular to the duct wall leads to a significantly asymmetric measured bubble 
velocity profile across the pipe diameter, especially for group-II bubbles. However, if the 
double-sensor probe is oriented parallel to the duct wall, a symmetric profile is observed. 
Therefore, when fabricating a conductivity probe, it is recommended that the double-
sensor probe used for bubble velocity measurements be oriented such that it will be 
parallel to the pipe wall. 
 
 

178 
 
 
Experiments were performed in nine vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow conditions 
in a 5.08cm inner diameter pipe at 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 1.00m/s and 2.00m/s with increasing gas flow rates in 
the transition region between the conventional bubbly and slug flow regimes to establish a 
reliable experimental database highlighting transition from one-group to two-group flows.  In 
each flow condition, the state-of-the-art four-sensor conductivity probe was used to acquire 
measurements of local time-averaged two-phase flow parameters, including the void fraction and 
interfacial area concentration, for group-I and group-II bubbles at three axial locations.  
 
 
The change in the local void fraction distribution from wall-peaked to center-peaked is a 
characteristic feature of the group transition. As group-I bubbles coalesce and increase in 
size, they migrate towards the center of the duct, causing this change in distribution. 
 
 
The shapes of the local void fraction and interfacial area concentration distributions 
deviate as the transition progresses since the larger bubbles that are responsible for the 
developing center-peaked void fraction profile contribute less interfacial area 
concentration.  
 
 
A key signature of the group transition is the development of a center-peaked 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 
profile with a maximum value of approximately 4mm. 
  
 
The axial development of the area-averaged void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration indicates active coalescence in these flow conditions that leads to transfer 
between the groups as the flow develops along the pipe. 
 
 
The total and group-I interfacial area concentrations begin to increase along the pipe in 
more established two-group flows, which suggests that the shearing-off mechanism 
becomes active as the transition progresses.

Assessment of TRACE-T in One-Group to Two-Group Transition Flows  
 
Several recent studies have sought to implement the interfacial area transport equation 
into the system analysis code TRACE in an effort to start moving away from the flow regime 
based closure of the two-fluid model (Schilling, 2007; Kim et al., 2011; Worosz, 2012; Talley et 
al., 2013; Bernard, 2014). TRACE is the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s 
consolidated system analysis code that is used for thermal-hydraulic analyses of light water 
nuclear reactors (TRACE v5.0 Theory Manual, 2007). As part of a recent study, Bernard (2014) 
implemented the two-group interfacial area transport equations into the most recent version of 
TRACE, TRACE v5.0 patch 3.0. This new version of TRACE was named TRACE-T to indicate 
its dynamic capability of predicting the interfacial area concentration with the interfacial area 
transport equation. To close the two-group interfacial area transport equations for adiabatic flows, 
Bernard (2014) implemented the two-group interfacial area transport model developed by Fu 
(2001) for moderate diameter pipes. The objective of this Chapter is to assess the performance of 
the interfacial area transport model available in TRACE-T in one-group to two-group transition 
flows using the newly established experimental database. The source/sink terms for intergroup 
coalescence of group-I bubbles to produce group-II bubbles are of particular interest since these 
are the mechanisms in the two-group interfacial area transport model for initiating the transition 
from one-group to two-group flows. An overview of the governing equations and interfacial area 
transport models available in TRACE-T is provided in Section 4.1. TRACE-T predictions of one-
group to two-group transition flow conditions are discussed in Section 4.2.

4.1 Overview of TRACE-T 
 
The framework of TRACE-T with the two-group interfacial area transport equation is 
briefly summarized in this Section; a detailed discussion of its development is given by Bernard 
(2014). TRACE-T with the two-group interfacial area transport equation solves a three-field two-
fluid model. The three fields are: 1) the continuous liquid field, 2) the group-I gas field, and 3) the 
group-II gas field. Section 4.1.1 summarizes the governing balance equations for mass, 
momentum, and energy and the two-group interfacial area transport equations that are 
implemented in TRACE-T. The available two-group interfacial area transport models (Fu, 2001) 
that were implemented into TRACE-T (Bernard, 2014) are summarized in Section 4.1.2. 
4.1.1 Governing Equations 
 
TRACE-T solves three continuity equations: 1) total mixture continuity, 2) total gas 
continuity, and 3) group-II gas continuity. The use of a total mixture continuity equation as 
opposed to a separate liquid continuity equation helps to guarantee conservation of mass of the 
gas and liquid phases during the transition from single-phase liquid flow to two-phase flow in 
heated flows with phase change; this choice stems from the existing equation framework in 
TRACE v5.0 path 3 (TRACEv5.0 Theory Manual, 2007). Analogously, to better account for 
exchanges of mass between the group-I and group-II gas fields due to intergroup bubble 
interactions, Bernard (2014) implemented total gas and group-II gas continuity equations instead 
of separate group-I and group-II continuity equations. In view of this, the total mixture, total gas, 
and group-II gas continuity equations in TRACE-T are given, respectively, as:

[4-3] 
With Equations [4-1] through [4-3], the group-I void fraction and mass generation rate are 
determined in TRACE-T through the following constitutive relations: 
𝛼1 = 𝛼−𝛼2 
[4-4] 
𝛤𝑔1 = 𝛤𝑔−𝛤𝑔2 
[4-5] 
Intergroup transfer due to the expansion/contraction of bubbles across the group boundary is 
assumed to be negligible in TRACE-T. This corresponds to the intergroup expansion/contraction 
transfer coefficient in the two-group interfacial area transport equations and in the net intergroup 
mass transfer rate (Δ𝑚̇ 12) in the group-II continuity equation being set to zero (i.e. 𝜒= 0). Thus, 
Δ𝑚̇ 12 in Equation [4-3] is only due to intergroup bubble interactions and is given by: 
Δ𝑚̇ 12 = 𝜌𝑔∑𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟

[4-6]

The liquid, group-I gas, and group-II gas fields each have their own equation of motion in 
TRACE-T, which are given, respectively, as:

[4-9] 
where 𝒇𝑤𝑓, 𝒇𝑤𝑔1, and 𝒇𝑤𝑔2 represent the wall shear forces per unit volume acting on the liquid, 
group-I, and group-II fields, respectively. 𝒇𝑖1 is the interfacial shear force per unit volume 
between the group-I gas field and the liquid field. Likewise, 𝒇𝑖2 is the interfacial shear force per 
unit volume between the group-II gas field and the liquid field. 𝒇𝑖 is the total interfacial shear 
force per unit volume between the gas and liquid fields (i.e. 𝒇𝑖= 𝒇𝑖1 + 𝒇𝑖2). 𝒗𝑖 is the interfacial 
velocity that is associated with the momentum transfer due to phase change. 
 
In TRACE-T, it is assumed that the group-I and group-II gas fields are in thermal 
equilibrium. Therefore, TRACE-T solves a total mixture internal energy equation and a total gas 
internal energy equation. The use of the mixture internal energy equation, as opposed to a 
separate liquid internal energy equation, in TRACE improves the code’s ability to handle the 
transition from single-phase to two-phase flow (TRACE v5.0 Theory Manual, 2007). Thus, the 
total mixture internal energy and total gas internal energy equations in TRACE-T are given by:

[4-11] 
where 𝑒𝑔 and 𝑒𝑓 are the internal energies of the gas and liquid phases. 𝑞𝑤𝑔 and 𝑞𝑤𝑓  represent the 
heat transfer per unit volume between the wall and the gas and liquid phases, respectively. 
𝑞𝑑𝑔 and 𝑞𝑑𝑓 account for the direct heating per unit volume of the gas and liquid, respectively. 𝑞𝑖𝑔 
represents the heat transferred to the gas from the gas/liquid interface. 𝛤𝑔ℎ𝑣′  represents the energy 
transfer per unit volume during phase change. Here,  ℎ𝑣′  is taken to be the enthalpy of the bulk 
vapor during condensation, while during vaporization it is taken to be the saturation enthalpy. 
Additional details on the implementation of the continuity equations, equations of motion, and 
internal energy equations and selection of the constitutive relations in TRACE-T are discussed by 
Bernard (2014). 
 
The two-group interfacial area transport equations that are implemented into TRACE-T 
use a form of the corrected expansion/contraction source/sink terms that were developed in 
Chapter 2. As previously mentioned, intergroup transfer due to the expansion/contraction of 
bubbles across the group boundary is assumed to be negligible in TRACE-T. Thus, the two-group 
interfacial area transport equations that are implemented into TRACE-T can be obtained by 
setting the intergroup expansion/contraction transfer coefficient to zero (i.e. 𝜒= 0) in Equations 
[2-151] and [2-152]. Doing so, the two-group interfacial area transport equations that are 
implemented into TRACE-T are given as:

[4-13]
Therefore, the effects of intergroup particle interactions are correctly accounted for in the two-
group interfacial area transport equations that are implemented into TRACE-T.  
 
To close the two-group interfacial area transport equations, Bernard (2014) implemented 
the two-group interfacial area transport source/sink term models developed by Fu (2001) for 
moderate diameter pipes into TRACE-T. Additionally, the group interfacial velocities (𝒗𝑖1 and 
𝒗𝑖2) in the two-group interfacial area transport equations were assumed to be equal to the group 
velocities (𝒗𝑔1 and 𝒗𝑔2) obtained from the group equations of motion, Equations [4-8] and [4-9]. 
Since the objective of this Chapter is to assess the performance of the available interfacial area 
transport model in TRACE-T in one-group to two-group transition flows, the two-group 
interfacial area transport source/sink term models developed by Fu (2001) are summarized in 
Section 4.1.2. 
  4.1.2 Available Two-Group Interfacial Area Transport Source/Sink Models 
As discussed in Chapter 1, Fu (2001) developed two-group interfacial area transport 
source/sink term models for the major bubble interaction mechanisms in moderate diameter 
pipes. This Section summarizes the source/sink term models that Fu (2001) developed for: 
intragroup wake entrainment of group-II bubbles (WE 22,2), intergroup wake entrainment of 
group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles (WE 12,2), intergroup shearing-off of group-I bubbles from 

185 
 
group-II bubbles (SO 2,12). Also, the modifications that were made to the one-group turbulence 
impact, random collision, and wake entrainment models (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999) to 
generalize them for use in two-group flow conditions are presented. These models are 
summarized in Sections 4.1.2.1 through 4.1.2.7. The detailed development of the source/sink term 
models can be found in Fu (2001) and Fu and Ishii (2002a). Also, a concise overview of the 
bubble interaction models along with their evaluation against the experimental database 
established by (Fu, 2001) is provided in Fu and Ishii (2002b).  
4.1.2.1 Wake Entrainment (22,2) 
The intragroup interfacial area concentration sink to group-II due to wake entrainment of 
two group-II bubbles yielding a group-II bubble is given as: 
𝜙𝑊𝐸

) −1]
−1
 
[4-14] 
where 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(2) and 𝐶1 are empirical coefficients, and 𝛼2,𝑚𝑎𝑥 is the maximum cross-sectional void 
fraction of a slug bubble (i.e. a group-II bubble). The parameter 𝑉𝑠∗, which occurs in several of the 
interaction models, is the ratio of the minimum to maximum slug bubble volumes (i.e. 𝑉𝑠∗=
𝑉𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛/𝑉𝑠,𝑚𝑎𝑥). For 𝑉𝑠,𝑚𝑎𝑥≫𝑉𝑠,𝑚𝑖𝑛,  𝑉𝑠∗ is related to the group-II Sauter-mean diameter as (Fu, 2001): 
𝐷𝑆𝑚2 =
1.35𝐷
1 + 6.86𝑉𝑠∗−2.54𝑉𝑠∗2 
[4-15] 
where 𝐷 is the pipe inner diameter. Equation [4-15] is quadratic in 𝑉𝑠∗, so an analytical solution for 𝑉𝑠∗ 
can be obtained in terms of  𝐷 and 𝐷𝑆𝑚2. In view of the definition of 𝑉𝑠∗, its values must be bounded 
by zero and one. Therefore, in solving for 𝑉𝑠∗, only the roots that fall within these bounds are 

186 
 
considered. This eliminates one of the solutions to Equation [4-15], which is always greater than 1, 
leaving the following solution:  
𝑉𝑠∗= 6.86 −√Δ
2(2.54)  
[4-16] 
In order to avoid imaginary solutions with Equation [4-16], the discriminant (Δ) is evaluated in 
TRACE-T as: 
Δ = max {[6.862 + 4(2.54) (1 −1.35
𝐷
𝐷𝑆𝑚2
)] , 0} 
[4-17] 
Furthermore, additional checks are placed on 𝑉𝑠∗ in the numerical implementation in TRACE-T to 
ensure that the final value is bounded between zero and one.   
4.1.2.2 Wake Entrainment (12,2) 
The intergroup interfacial area concentration sink to group-I due to the entrainment of 
group-I bubbles in the wake region of a group-II bubble is given as:

The void fraction source to group-II that is used in the net intergroup mass transfer rate in the

[4-20] 
In Equations [4-18] through [4-20], 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(12,2) is an empirical coefficient for the wake 
entrainment (12,2) mechanism. The parameter 𝜅𝑓𝑟 is the liquid film velocity reduction factor 
which accounts for the effect of wall friction on the velocity of the liquid film around a Taylor 
bubble, which is given as (Fu, 2001): 
𝜅𝑓𝑟= 1 −exp (−𝐶𝑓𝑟𝑉𝑠
∗1 2
⁄

[4-21] 
where 𝐶𝑓𝑟 is an empirical coefficient. Lastly, 𝐶𝑔 represents the following collection of terms in 
the models: 
𝐶𝑔= √
2𝑔𝛥𝜌

[4-22] 
It is noted that the units of Fu’s (2001) models for 𝜙𝑊𝐸
(2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,1
(12,2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,2
(12,2), 𝜂𝑊𝐸,2
(12,2), and 𝜅𝑓𝑟 
are inconsistent. This implies that the empirical coefficients in these terms are dimensional. Since 
Fu (2001) developed his interfacial area transport model using an experimental database 
established in a similar test section to the one used in the experiments in the present dissertation, 
the models can be considered applicable to the current conditions. Correcting and implementing 
models for these terms into TRACE-T is beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, revised 
models for these terms should be implemented into TRACE-T in future work so that the two-
group interfacial area transport model can be applied for flows other than those similar to the 

188 
 
flows in the test section used in Fu’s (2001) study. Moreover, the primary interest of this Chapter 
is the behavior of the intergroup 𝜙𝑅𝐶,1
(11,2), 𝜙𝑅𝐶,2
(11,2), 𝜂𝑅𝐶,2
(11,2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,1
(11,2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2), and  𝜂𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) source/sink 
terms in the one-group to two-group transition conditions. These intergroup coalescence terms are 
responsible for creating group-II interfacial area concentration and void fraction from group-I. 
The units of these terms, which are presented in Sections 4.1.2.5 through 4.1.2.7, are consistent.       
4.1.2.3 Shearing-Off (2,12) 
The intergroup interfacial area concentration source to group-I due to the shearing-off

⁄  
[4-25] 
𝐶𝑆𝑂 is an empirical coefficient for the shearing-off mechanism. In these models, the term 
(1 −0.6474𝜅𝑏𝑙) is designated as the boundary layer profile factor (Fu, 2001). This contains 

189 
 
information about the boundary layer thickness inside a slug bubble which is used to determine 
the total volume of gas that is sheared off from a group-II bubble. The parameter 𝜅𝑏𝑙 is given as: 
𝜅𝑏𝑙= (𝐷−0.3𝛼2,𝑚𝑎𝑥

1 7
⁄  
[4-26] 
where 𝜈𝑔 is the kinematic viscosity of the gas-phase. 
Lastly, 𝜉𝑆𝑂 represents the ratio of the average to maximum bubble diameter generated in 
the shearing-off process, which is expressed as (Fu, 2001): 
𝜉𝑆𝑂= [1 −exp (−𝛾𝑆𝑂(
𝛼2,𝑚𝑎𝑥
𝛼2,𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝛼2
)
𝛽𝑆𝑂𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟1
𝑊𝑒1
)]
−1
 
[4-27] 
where 𝛾𝑆𝑂 and 𝛽𝑆𝑂 are empirical coefficients. In Fu’s (2001) model, the shearing-off interaction 
is viewed as a two-step process. First, the rim of the group-II bubble is sheared off. Then, the rim 
is broken up by turbulence into numerous small bubbles in the wake region; a process similar to 
turbulence impact breakup. Thus, 𝜉𝑆𝑂 is a function of the critical Weber number for group-I 
bubble breakup (𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟1) and the group-I bubble Weber number (𝑊𝑒1). 𝑊𝑒1 is defined in Section 
4.1.2.4 when the model for the intragroup turbulence impact breakup mechanism for group-I 
bubbles is introduced.    
4.1.2.4 Turbulence Impact (1,11) 
The form of the intragroup interfacial area concentration source to group-I due to 
turbulence impact breakup is the same as that in the one-group interfacial area transport model 
(Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999), which is repeated here for convenience:

[4-28] 
The group-I bubble Weber number (𝑊𝑒1) is defined in terms of the turbulent fluctuation velocity 
(𝑢𝑡) as: 
𝑊𝑒1 = 𝜌𝑓𝑢𝑡
2𝐷𝑆𝑚1
𝜎
 
[4-29] 
In order for breakup to occur, the inertia force due to the turbulent fluctuations must be sufficient 
to overcome the surface tension force. Thus, 𝑊𝑒1 must exceed a critical Weber number (𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟1) 
for group-I bubble breakup to occur. 𝑊𝑒1 and 𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟1 are also used in Equation [4-27]  in the 
shearing-off model. 
Although the form of the group-I turbulence impact breakup source term was assumed to 
be the same, Fu (2001) postulated that there are two contributions to the turbulent fluctuation 
velocity in a two-group flow. One contribution is due to the turbulent velocity fluctuations over a 
length scale proportional to the group-I bubble Sauter-mean diameter assuming isotropic 
homogenous turbulence. This contribution is denoted as 𝑢𝑡,𝑖𝑠𝑜 and is specified by Fu (2001) as:   
𝑢𝑡,𝑖𝑠𝑜= (𝜀𝐷𝑆𝑚1)1/3 
[4-30] 
In the development of the turbulence impact breakup mechanism for the one-group interfacial 
area transport equation (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999), the turbulence was also assumed to be 
isotropic and homogenous. However, the expression for 𝑢𝑡,𝑖𝑠𝑜 used by Wu et al. (1998) and Kim 
(1999) contained a factor of 1.4 instead of 1.0 outside of the parentheses in Equation [4-30]. The 
factor of 1.4, or actually √2, is consistent with the assumption made in the development of the 

191 
 
turbulence impact mechanism (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999) that the group-I bubble size (i.e. the 
length scale of the turbulent fluctuations) lies within the inertial subrange of isotropic 
homogenous turbulence (Rotta, 1972; Pope, 2000). Granted, this is an approximation of the 
turbulence characteristics of a two-phase flow, which leaves room for interpretation of the 
“correct” coefficient to use. However, Bernard (2014) found that using the factor 1.4 instead of 
1.0 yielded significantly better predictions of the interfacial area concentration in the one-group 
bubbly flows that he investigated at relatively high liquid superficial velocities (〈𝑗𝑓〉 ~ 4 - 5m/s) 
where the turbulence impact breakup mechanism is an active source to the interfacial area 
concentration. Therefore, in view of these improved results and to be consistent with the 
development of the one-group model (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999), the isotropic turbulent 
fluctuation velocity used in TRACE-T is given as: 
𝑢𝑡,𝑖𝑠𝑜= √2(𝜀𝐷𝑆𝑚1)1 3
⁄ ≈1.4(𝜀𝐷𝑆𝑚1)1/3 
[4-31] 
 
The turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate (𝜀) is evaluated using a simple algebraic 
correlation given by (Kim, 1999): 
𝜀=
𝑓2𝜙𝑣𝑚3

[4-32] 
where the two-phase friction factor (𝑓2𝜙) and mixture velocity (𝑣𝑚) are specified as:

Fu (2001) postulated that the second contribution to the turbulent fluctuation velocity is 
due to the merging the wall jet from around a slug bubble with the following liquid slug. This was 
denoted as the wake turbulent fluctuation velocity (𝑢𝑡,𝑤). The wake turbulent fluctuation 
velocity, which has inconsistent units, is given by Fu (2001) as:

4.1.2.5 Generalized Group-I Coalescence 
To generalize the one-group random collision and wake entrainment coalescence models, 
Fu (2001) assumed that the same coalescence rates, 𝑅𝑅𝐶
(1) and 𝑅𝑊𝐸
(1) , developed by Wu et al. (1998) 
and Kim (1999) would apply in two-group conditions. However, Fu (2001) incorporated variable 
group-I bubble size to allow for the generation of group-II bubbles from group-I bubbles through 

193 
 
intergroup random collision and wake entrainment interactions. Fu (2001) expressed the 
interfacial area concentration source terms for random collision and wake entrainment between 
two group-I bubbles as a product of the interaction rate and the change in surface area for a given 
interaction.  In this way, an interfacial area concentration source term for the generalized 
coalescence of group-I bubbles can be written as:  
𝜙𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎) = ⟨𝛿𝐴𝑖,𝑐
(𝑎)⟩
𝑅
𝑅𝑏
(1) 
[4-39] 
Likewise, for the intergroup random collision and wake entrainment interactions, the 
corresponding void source is written as: 
𝜂𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎) = ⟨𝛿𝑉𝑐
(𝑎)⟩
𝑅
𝑅𝑏
(1) 
[4-40] 
𝛿𝐴𝑖,𝑐
(𝑎) represents the change in interfacial area for the 𝑐𝑡ℎ group, and 𝛿𝑉𝑐
(𝑎) represents the change 
in volume for the 𝑐𝑡ℎ group for a given interaction between two group-I bubbles. Recall that the 
change in volume is equal but opposite for each group. However, the change in surface area is 
different due to the different bubble shapes in each group. The superscript (a) indicates either the 
coalescence of two group-I bubbles to form another group-I bubble (𝑎= 11,1) or the coalescence 
of two group-I bubbles to form a group-II bubble (𝑎= 11,2).  𝑅𝑏
(1) is the interaction rate for 
either random collision (𝑏= 𝑅𝐶) or wake entrainment (𝑏= 𝑊𝐸) of two group-I bubbles. The 
operator 〈
〉𝑅 denotes the ratio from a statistical average (Fu, 2001).  
To determine the ⟨𝛿𝐴𝑖,𝑐
(𝑎)⟩
𝑅
 and ⟨𝛿𝑉𝑐
(𝑎)⟩
𝑅
 terms for the possible intra- and intergroup 
random collision and wake entrainment interactions of group-I bubbles, Fu (2001) considered the 
probability (𝜉 ) of two group-I bubbles of volumes 𝑉𝑏1 and 𝑉𝑏2, respectively, coalescing to form a 

194 
 
group-II bubble. That is, a resultant bubble with volume greater than the volume defining the 
group boundary (𝑉𝑐). Assuming uniform bubble volume distributions for both interacting group-I 
bubbles, this probability was obtained as (Fu, 2001): 
𝜉= 2(1 −0.2894𝐷1
∗3)
2 
[4-41] 
where  𝐷1
∗ is defined as:  
 𝐷1
∗=
𝐷𝑐
𝐷𝑆𝑚1
 
[4-42] 
𝐷𝑐 is the critical bubble diameter at the boundary between group-I and group-II that defines the 
critical bubble volume 𝑉𝑐. 𝐷𝑐 is specified through the maximum distorted bubble limit (Ishii and 
Zuber 1979) as:  
𝐷𝑐= 4√
𝜎
𝑔Δ𝜌 
[4-43] 
Averaging the surface area changes and volume changes over the assumed size 
distributions of the interacting group-I bubbles with volumes 𝑉𝑏1 and 𝑉𝑏2, Fu (2001) obtained the 
following expressions for characteristic surface area and volume changes for intra- and intergroup 
coalescence of group-I bubbles:

When the group-I Sauter-mean diameter is less than the prescribed bound in Equations 
[4-44] through [4-47], the coalescence of two group-I bubbles will always yield a group-I bubble. 
This bound corresponds to setting Equation [4-41] to zero (i.e. zero probability of producing 
group-II) and solving for 𝐷1
∗. The expressions for the area and volume changes developed by Fu 
(2001) (i.e. the second lines in Equations [4-44] through [4-47]) do not behave physically for 
group-I Sauter-mean diameters less than this lower bound. Hence, the area and volume changes 
associated with the intergroup coalescence of group-I bubbles to form group-II are set to zero for 
group-I Sauter-mean diameters less than the bound. The area change associated with intragroup 
coalescence of group-I bubbles is set to −1.001𝐷𝑆𝑚1
2
 , which is consistent with the one-group 
interfacial area transport model (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999). Furthermore, if 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 exceeds 
[2(0.2894)]
1 3
⁄ 𝐷𝑐, ⟨𝛿𝐴𝑖1
(11,2)⟩ becomes positive. The intergroup coalescence of group-I bubbles to 
form group-I should always be a sink to the group-I interfacial area concentration. Therefore, the 
expressions yield unphysical results beyond this upper limit, as well. This upper limit corresponds 

196 
 
to the maximum group-I bubble size reaching the bubble size at the group boundary (Worosz, 
2012). In order to prevent such nonphysical results,  𝐷1
∗ is prescribed as follows in TRACE-T:  
 𝐷1
∗=
{
 
 
 
    𝐷𝑐
𝐷𝑆𝑚1
                    ,
𝑓𝑜𝑟  𝐷𝑆𝑚1 < 𝐷𝑐[2(0.2894)]

[2(0.2894)]1/3   ,
𝑓𝑜𝑟  𝐷𝑆𝑚1 ≥𝐷𝑐[2(0.2894)]
1 3
⁄
 
[4-48] 
The treatment of 𝐷1
∗ and the area and volume changes given by Equations [4-44] through [4-47] 
in TRACE-T is consistent with their implementation into the MATLAB script that Fu (2001) 
used to evaluate his two-group interfacial area transport model (Worosz, 2012).

(1) reduces the same form that was developed for the 
one-group interfacial area transport equation (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999) that is given by 
Equation [1-17].    
4.1.2.7 Wake Entrainment (11,1) and (11,2) 
Similar to the random collision mechanism, the interfacial area concentration and void 
fraction source/sink terms for intra- and intergroup wake entrainment of group-I bubbles are 
given as:

(1) reduces the same 
form that was developed for the one-group interfacial area transport equation (Wu et al., 1998; 
Kim, 1999) that is given by Equation [1-18].    
 
The group-I bubble drag coefficient (𝐶𝐷1) in the wake entrainment (11,1) and (11,2) 
models is calculated from the distorted fluid particle regime correlation for gas bubbles in liquid 
(Ishii and Chawla,1979; Ishii and Zuber, 1979) as:

4.2 Assessment with One-Group to Two-Group Transition Test Conditions 
Figure 4-1 shows the TRACE-T predictions of the void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration measurements acquired in Run 3. At first glance, it appears that the existing two-
group interfacial area transport model performs well in comparison to the experimental data. 
However, note that it fails to capture the exchange in group void fractions in Figure 4-1(c). 
Granted only a small amount void fraction exchange occurs between the groups in this condition. 
However, it is these minute exchanges that will initiate the one-group to two-group transition 
process. Figure 4-2 shows the contributions to the change in the group interfacial area 
concentrations along the pipe from the various source/sink terms in the two-group interfacial area 
transport equations. There are several important observations that can be made in studying these 
plots. First, the intergroup interfacial area concentration source/sink terms responsible for 

200 
 
creating group-II interfacial area concentration from group-I, i.e., 𝜙𝑊𝐸,1
(11,2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2), 𝜙𝑅𝐶,1
(11,2), and 
𝜙𝑅𝐶,2
(11,2), are not active at all in this condition. The corresponding intergroup void fraction 
source/sink terms, 𝜂𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) and 𝜂𝑅𝐶,2
(11,2), are not active either. In view of Equations [4-44] through 
[4-47], these intergroup source/sink terms in Fu’s (2001) model are only active when 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 is 
greater than approximately 7mm for air-water flows near ambient pressure. A group-I Sauter-
mean diameter of 7mm is unphysical; the maximum value observed in the present experiments 
was around 5mm. Additionally, the 𝜙𝑊𝐸,1
(12,2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,2
(12,2), and 𝜂𝑊𝐸,2
(12,2) source/sink terms are effectively 
inactive. This mechanism is responsible for driving the transition from one-group to established 
two-group flows. Lastly, shearing-off is a significant source of group-I interfacial area 
concentration. As pointed out by Kim (1999) and Sun (2001), the shearing-off mechanism should 
only occur for group-II bubbles once they reach a sufficient size. Furthermore, the work of 
Kockx, et al. (2005) suggests that slug bubbles must elongate a certain length for appreciable 
shearing-off to occur. In view of this,  active shearing-off in the cap-bubbly flows at the initiation 
of transition from one-group to two-group flows, such as Run 3, in not physical.  
Similar TRACE-T predictions of the group-I and group-II void fractions and interfacial 
area concentrations are shown in Figure 4-3 for Run 8. At this lower liquid flow rate condition, 
the exchange in void fraction between the groups is much more pronounced. Although the total 
void fraction is predicted quite well, the model fails to predict the significant exchange of the 
group void fractions. Additionally, although the interfacial area concentration prediction indicates 
active coalescence, it is not enough to capture the decreasing trend shown by the experimental 
data. Considering the source term contributions in Figure 4-4, the interaction mechanisms 
responsible for initiating and driving the transition are inactive as in Run 3. This clearly 
demonstrates the need for improved interfacial area transport models for one-group to two-group 
transition flows.

4.3 Chapter Summary 
 
The newly established experimental database that highlights one-group to two-group 
transition was used to assess the available two-group interfacial area transport model for 
moderate diameter pipes (Fu 2001; Fu and Ishii, 2002a) in TRACE-T. Predictions of the 
experimental data were made using the systems analysis code TRACE-T (Bernard, 2014) with 
Fu’s (2001) two-group source/sink term models. Major observations from the assessment include: 
 
 
The intergroup coalescence mechanisms between group-I bubbles that are responsible for 
generating group-II interfacial area concentration and void fraction from group-I were not 
active in the predictions of the one-group to two-group transition conditions. 
 
 
Intergroup wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles was effectively 
inactive in the predictions. Physically, this is a major mechanism during the transition 
process from one-group to two-group flows.  
 
 
The shearing-off mechanism was an active source of group-I interfacial area 
concentration in conditions with low contribution of group-II bubbles. This is unphysical, 
since the cap-bubbly flows at the beginning of transition from one-group to two-group 
flows do not contain group-II bubbles of sufficient size for shearing-off to occur.    
 
These observations clearly establish the need for an improved two-group interfacial area transport 
model for one-group to two-group transition flows.

Development of Interfacial Area Transport Model 
for One-Group to Two-Group Transition Flows  
In the two-group interfacial area transport equation framework, source terms for the 
intergroup coalescence of group-I bubbles to form group-II bubbles are responsible for the 
generation of group-II interfacial area concentration and void fraction starting from a purely one-
group condition.  Furthermore, the coalescence of group-I bubbles with group-II bubbles drives 
the evolution of the flow towards an established two-group flow condition. The modeling 
approach to developing a two-group interfacial area transport model for one-group to two-group 
transition flows is discussed in Section 5.1. In Section 5.2, source/sink terms for the interfacial 
area concentration and void fraction are developed to establish a two-group interfacial area 
transport model for one-group to two-group transition flows. 
5.1 Modeling Approach 
5.1.1 Framework of One-Group to Two-Group Transition 
Figure 5-1 schematically shows the framework of the transition from one-group to two 
group flows. The flow starts as a purely one-group flow, where bubbles are dispersed and similar 
in size. Here, the one-group interfacial area transport equation (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999) is 
applicable. As larger group-I bubbles become present in the flow, the bubble transport 
characteristics become wake-dominated. Wake-entrainment coalescence was identified early on 
in previous studies as the major mechanism responsible for the transition from bubbly to slug 

207 
 
flow (Radovcich and Moissis, 1962; Mishima and Ishii, 1984). Additionally, the transition void 
fraction distributions observed in the experiments are due to the migration of larger group-I 
bubbles towards the center of the duct. This occurs due to a change in direction of the transverse 
lift force owing to the wake structure that develops behind larger deformed bubbles (Tomiyama et 
al., 2002). This can be regarded as another signature of wake-dominated bubble transport. 
Therefore, increasing importance of wake-dominated bubble transport characterizes the initiation 
of the transition from one-group to two-group flows. As the transition progresses, group-II 
bubbles will grow in size through wake-entrainment coalescence interactions with group-I and 
other group-II bubbles, and an established two-group flow structure will develop. As observed in 
the experiments, the interfacial area concentration decreases early in transition due to the active 
coalescence leading to transfer between the groups. However, as a more established two-group 
flow structure develops, the interfacial area concentration begins to increase again, which is 
attributed to the shearing-off mechanism becoming active. These trends characterize the 
development of an established two-group flow structure in which shearing-off is the major source 
and wake-entrainment as the major sink to the interfacial area concentration.

The framework of the two-group interfacial area transport equations was established in 
Chapter 2. In the development, the boundary between group-I and group-II is specified through a 
critical bubble volume (𝑉𝑐). This critical volume should be defined by a critical bubble length 
scale (𝐷𝑐). In general, the critical bubble length scale that defines the group boundary must be 
considered as a variable to be determined for the flow under consideration:   
𝐷𝑐= 𝐷𝑐(𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠, 𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡 𝑔𝑒𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑦, 𝑏𝑢𝑏𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑎, ) 
[5-1] 
With 𝐷𝑐 specified, the critical bubble volume at the group boundary can be defined as:  
𝑉𝑐= 𝜋
6 𝐷𝑐3  
[5-2] 
In view of the differences in interfacial drag characteristics and major bubble interaction 
mechanisms for smaller dispersed bubbles and larger cap/slug/churn-turbulent bubbles, the 
maximum distorted bubble limit (Ishii and Zuber, 1979) is considered as the critical bubble length 
scale for moderate size ducts: 
𝐷𝑐= 𝐷𝑑,𝑚𝑎𝑥= 4√
𝜎
𝑔Δ𝜌  
[5-3] 
Flow in a small size duct is a good example of where a different length scale would have to be 
chosen to define the group boundary; see Section 2.3.4.2 for considerations on duct size 
categorization in regards to two-group interfacial area transport modeling. In the case of a small 
size duct, the bubble length scale would become comparable to the channel length scale before 
the maximum distorted bubble size is reached. Therefore, the critical bubble length scale should 
depend on the channel length scale in the case of a small size duct. The present dissertation 

209 
 
considers flows in moderate size ducts, so the critical bubble length scale given by Equation [5-3] 
is appropriate to define the group boundary.  
If one considers moving through the one-group to two-group transition, the flow starts as 
a pure one-group flow. Therefore, the one-group models (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999) for 
intragroup turbulence impact breakup, random collision coalescence, and wake-entrainment 
coalescence of group-I bubbles are retained. As the transition progresses, however, the structure 
of the flow progressively deviates from the pure one-group flow structure that was assumed in 
developing the one-group models. Although the intragroup interactions of group-I bubbles likely 
still occur in established two-group flows, intergroup wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles into 
group-II bubbles and shearing-off become the major mechanisms that dictate the changes in the 
interfacial area concentration. Therefore, the importance of the one-group source/sink terms in the 
two-group interfacial area transport equation should diminish as the transition progresses towards 
and established two-group flow.  
It is observed in the present experiments that larger, distorted group-I bubbles and 
clusters of group-I bubbles are present in the flow in the initial stages of transition. The larger 
group-I bubbles and bubble clusters will have a greater chance of entraining other bubbles in their 
wakes. Therefore, intergroup wake entrainment of group-I bubbles is considered as the 
mechanism to create group-II bubbles starting from a one-group condition. Although intergroup 
random collision of group-I bubbles forming a group-II bubble could be possible, the signature of 
transition from one-group to two-group flows is the increasing importance of wake-dominated 
bubble transport. Furthermore, since the random collision mechanism is driven by the turbulent 
fluctuations in the liquid, the production of group-II bubbles by intergroup random collision 
would increase with increasing liquid flow rate, which is unphysical. Therefore, intergroup 
random collision of group-I bubbles is not considered as the mechanism for group-II production. 
Once group-II bubbles are available in the flow, they entrain group-I bubbles in their wake 

210 
 
regions. The coalescences that result from the intergroup wake-entrainment of group-I and group-
II bubbles drive the transition towards an established two-group flow. Additionally, intragroup 
coalescence of group-II bubbles is the dominant sink to the number of group-II bubbles, and 
consequently group-II interfacial area concentration, as the transition progresses.  
As pointed out in previous studies (Kim, 1999; Sun, 2001; Kockx, et al., 2005), shearing-
off should not occur until group-II bubbles reach a sufficient size. In moderate size ducts, this is 
related to the group-II bubbles growing such that they fill the cross-section and begin to elongate. 
At the initiation of transition, group-II bubbles have not yet filled the pipe cross-section, so 
shearing-off should not be active. However, as the transition progresses, the shearing-off 
mechanism should become active and start to offset the intergroup wake entrainment of between 
group-I and group-II bubbles. Therefore, a shearing-off mechanism that activates as an 
established two-group flow structure develops is needed to complete the model for one-group to 
two-group transition flows. 
Table 5-1 summarizes the major bubble interaction mechanism source/sink terms that are 
required for a two-group interfacial area transport model for one-group to two-group transition 
flows. The major modeling effort that is required is the development of intergroup wake 
entrainment source/sink terms to initiate and drive the one-group to two-group transition. 
Additionally, a model for intragroup wake entrainment of group-II bubbles needs to be 
developed. As a first step to including shearing-off, the available shearing-off model developed 
by Fu (2001) will be modified so that it becomes active as an established two-group flow 
develops. Also, the available models for the intragroup interactions of group-I bubbles will be 
modified to reflect their diminishing importance as an established two-group flow develops.

5.1.2 Constitutive Form of Source/Sink Terms 
In previous developments of two-group interfacial area transport models (Fu, 2001; Sun, 
2001), an integral approach was used to derive the source/term models for the interfacial area 
concentration and void fraction. This approach requires one to know the bubble volume 
distribution function (𝑓(𝑉)). Since 𝑓(𝑉) is not known, one requires a model for 𝑓(𝑉) in order to 
develop interfacial area concentration and void fraction source/sink terms using the integral 
approach.  In previous developments of the two-group IATE (Fu, 2001; Sun 2001), uniform 
bubble volume distributions were assumed for the group-I and group-II bubbles. However, this 
assumption dictates the criterion at which the intergroup interactions responsible for creating 
group-II from group-I become active; this criterion was shown to be unphysical in Chapter 4. 
Even though the bubble volume distribution is incorporated through the integral approach, 
numerous approximations are required to arrive at useful forms of the source/sink terms, and one 
inevitably relies on experimental data to adjust the coefficients of proportionality that arise in the 

212 
 
source/sink term models. In view of this, a more tractable approach to developing the interfacial 
area concentration and void fraction source/sink term models is used in this dissertation. 
Similar to the development of the one-group bubble interaction source/sink terms (Wu et 
al., 1998; Kim, et al., 1999), it is assumed that the interfacial area concentration source/sink terms 
can be modeled as the product of a characteristic surface area change and an interaction rate per 
unit mixture volume as: 
𝜙𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎) = (Δ𝐴𝑖)𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎)𝑅𝑏
(𝑎) 
[5-4] 
Likewise, the void fraction source/sink terms for the intergroup bubble interactions are modeled 
as the product of a characteristic volume change and an interaction rate per unit mixture volume 
as: 
𝜂𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎) = (Δ𝑉)𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎)𝑅𝑏
(𝑎) 
[5-5] 
where:   
 
(a): relationship between interacting and resultant particles (e.g. (a) = (11,2)) 
b: interaction mechanism (e.g. b = WE) 
c: affected group: (e.g. c=1) 
(Δ𝐴𝑖)𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎): characteristic surface area change for interaction mechanism (b, (a)) for group c 
(Δ𝑉)𝑏,𝑐
(𝑎): characteristic volume change for interaction mechanism (b, (a)) for group c 
𝑅𝑏
(𝑎): interaction rate per unit mixture volume for interaction mechanism (b,(a)) 
As discussed in Chapter 2, bubble volume is expected to be conserved during bubble interactions. 
Thus, the characteristic volume changes and void fraction source/sink terms for intragroup 

213 
 
interactions are zero. For intergroup interactions, the characteristic volume changes and void 
fraction source/sink terms are constrained as: 
(Δ𝑉)𝑏,1
(𝑎) = −(Δ𝑉)𝑏,2
(𝑎)   ⟺ 𝜂𝑏,1
(𝑎) = −𝜂𝑏,2
(𝑎)   
[5-6] 
Development of the interfacial area concentration and void fraction source/sink terms for: 
1) intergroup wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles to create group-II bubbles, 2) intergroup 
wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles, and 3) intragroup wake-entrainment 
of group-II bubbles are the major modeling efforts that are required to establish a two-group 
interfacial area transport model for one-group to two-group transition flows. The constitutive 
forms that will be used to model these source/sink terms are given in Table 5-2.

5.1.3 Approximate Bubble Shapes 
 
As in the previous interfacial area transport studies (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999; Sun, 
2001; Fu, 2001), the current work assumes that group-I bubbles are spheres. Therefore, the group-
I bubble shape factor (𝜑1) is assumed to be equal to one. Group-II bubbles are assumed to be 

214 
 
spherical-cap shaped with a wake angle of 50°. Recalling Equation [2-147], the shape factor for a 
spherical-cap bubble with a wake angle of 50° is given approximately as: 
𝜑2 = 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝≈1.7    ,   𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝜃= 50° 
[5-7] 
 
At the initiation of transition in a moderate diameter pipe, spherical-cap shaped group-II 
bubbles are a reasonable approximation. As the transition progresses, however, group-II bubbles 
grow in size and begin to fill the pipe cross-section and elongate. As the group-II bubbles grow, 
their shape will be increasingly influenced by the presence of the wall. Since the major objective 
of this work is to develop a two-group interfacial area transport model that has the capability of 
dynamically transitioning form a purely one-group flow into a two-group flow, the effect of 
changing group-II bubble shape is presently neglected. Assessing the effect of different group-II 
bubble shapes and developing a framework, if necessary, to evolve from one group-II bubble 
shape to another should be investigated in future studies.   
5.2 Source/Sink Term Model Development  
Wake-dominant bubble transport is a signature of the transition from one-group to two-
group flows. As such, models for intergroup wake entrainment to initiate and drive the one-group 
to two-group transition are required. In Section 5.2.1, a general wake-entrainment interaction rate 
model is developed to serve as the basis for developing the source/sink terms for: 1) intergroup 
wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles to produce a group-II bubble, 2) intergroup wake-
entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles, and 3) intragroup wake entrainment of 
group-II bubbles. The source/sink terms for each of these mechanisms are developed in Sections 
5.2.2 through 5.2.4, respectively. As a first step, the available shearing-off model developed by 

215 
 
Fu (2001) is modified to activate as the transition progresses; this is discussed in Section 5.2.5. 
Lastly, the available intragroup interaction models for group-I bubbles are modified in Section 
5.2.6 to reflect their diminishing importance as an established two-group flow develops.   
5.2.1 General Wake Entrainment Interaction Rate 
 
Following the approach outlined by Kim (1999), the interaction rate for the wake 
entrainment of a general following bubble, denoted by “x,” into a leading bubble, denoted by “y,” 
is developed in this Section.  Figure 5-2 schematically shows this interaction.   
 
Figure 5-2: Schematic of wake-entrainment interaction between a general following bubble “x” 
and leading bubble “y”. 
 
Assuming a cylindrical wake region behind a leading bubble “y,” the effective wake 
volume (𝑉𝑊𝑦) for a following bubble “x” to collide with bubble “y” is given as: 
𝑉𝑊𝑦= (𝜋
4 𝐷𝑦2) (𝐿𝑊𝑦−𝐷𝑦2
⁄ )  
[5-8] 

216 
 
where 𝐿𝑊𝑦 is the effective wake length within which following bubbles will accelerate and 
collide with the leading bubble. Considering Δ𝑡 as the average time for following bubbles inside 
the effective wake volume to catch up and collide with the leading bubble, the collision rate per 
unit mixture volume due to wake-entrainment (𝑅𝑊𝐸
(𝑥𝑦))  can be written as: 
𝑅𝑊𝐸
(𝑥𝑦)~ 1
2 𝑛𝑦
𝑁𝑊
Δ𝑡 
[5-9] 
where 𝑛𝑦 is the number density of the leading bubble, and 𝑁𝑊 is the number of following bubbles 
inside of the effective wake volume, which can be expressed as:  
𝑁𝑊= 𝑛𝑥𝑉𝑊𝑦= 𝑛𝑥(𝜋
4 𝐷𝑦2) (𝐿𝑊𝑦−𝐷𝑦2
⁄ ) 
[5-10] 
where 𝑛𝑥 is the number density of the following bubble. Note that (𝐿𝑊𝑦−𝐷𝑦2
⁄ )/Δ𝑡 represents 
the average relative velocity (𝑢̅𝑟𝑤) between the leading bubble and following bubbles in the 
effective wake region. Therefore, Equation [5-9] can be written as: 
𝑅𝑊𝐸
(𝑥𝑦)~ 1
2 𝑛𝑥𝑛𝑦(𝜋
4 𝐷𝑦2) 𝑢̅𝑟𝑤 
[5-11] 
 
Considering the velocity in an axisymmetric turbulent wake (Schlichting, 1979), 𝑢̅𝑟𝑤 can 
be estimated by averaging the wake velocity over the effective wake length to obtain (Kim, 
1999): 
𝑢̅𝑟𝑤~3𝜋1 3
⁄ 𝑢𝑟𝑦𝐶𝐷𝑦
1 3
⁄ 𝑓(𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
) 
[5-12] 

217 
 
 where 𝑢𝑟𝑦 and 𝐶𝐷𝑦 are the relative velocity and drag coefficient of the leading bubble “y.” 
𝑓(𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
) is a function of the non-dimensional wake length (𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
= 𝐿𝑊𝑦/(𝐷𝑦2
⁄ )) that is given by: 
𝑓(𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
) =
𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗1 3
⁄ −1
𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
−1  
[5-13] 
Substituting 𝑢̅𝑟𝑤 into Equation [5-11] yields:  
 
𝑅𝑊𝐸

⁄ )𝐶𝐷𝑦
1 3
⁄ 𝑛𝑥𝑛𝑦(𝜋
4 𝐷𝑦2) 𝑢𝑟𝑦𝑓(𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
) 
[5-14] 
 
Even if the following bubble collides with the leading bubble, it is not guaranteed that 
coalescence will occur. While there are coalescence efficiency models available in the literature, 
there is a lack of consensus on the correct form of such models and on the coalescence behaviors 
observed in experiments (Kirkpatrick and Lockett, 1974; Coulaloglou and Tavlarides, 1977; 
Thomas, 1981; Prince and Blanch, 1990; Stewart, 1995). Also, Kim (1999) points out that 𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
 
scales the effective wake length of the leading bubble, and that 𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
 depends not only on the 
leading bubble shape but also on whether the wake-entrainment is a binary interaction or involves 
swarms of bubbles. These microscopic effects are difficult to characterize in a macroscopic 
formulation for practical two-phase flows. Therefore, following the approach in previous works 
on the interfacial area transport equation (Wu et al., 1998; Kim, 1999; Fu, 2001; Sun, 2001), the 
coalescence efficiency and 𝑓(𝐿𝑊𝑦
∗
) are assumed to be constants that are  included in a 
proportionality coefficient, which is to be determined through experiment. Thus, the coalescence 
interaction rate between a leading bubble “y” and a following bubble “x” to produce a resultant 
bubble “z” is given as: 

218 
 
𝑅𝑊𝐸
(𝑥𝑦,𝑧) = 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(𝑥𝑦,𝑧) (3
2 𝜋1 3
⁄ ) 𝐶𝐷𝑦
1 3
⁄ 𝑛𝑥𝑛𝑦(𝜋
4 𝐷𝑦2) 𝑢𝑟𝑦 
[5-15] 
 
Observe that the wake-entrainment coalescence interaction rate scales on the product of 
the projected area of the leading bubble “y” (i.e. 𝐴𝑝,𝑦= (𝜋𝐷𝑦
2/4)) and its relative velocity. 
Although we have schematically viewed this interaction in terms of spherical bubbles, we can 
make use of this observation to generalize the model. Instead of expressing the wake-entrainment 
coalescence rate in terms of the leading bubble diameter, which becomes ambiguous as particles 
deviate from spherical, the model can be generalized by expressing the coalescence rate as a 
function of the leading bubble projected area as:  
𝑅𝑊𝐸
(𝑥𝑦,𝑧) = 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(𝑥𝑦,𝑧) (3
2 𝜋1 3
⁄ ) 𝐶𝐷𝑦
1 3
⁄ 𝑛𝑥𝑛𝑦𝐴𝑝𝑦𝑢𝑟𝑦 
[5-16] 
Furthermore, recall that the drag diameter (𝐷𝐷) is defined as (Ishii and Mishima, 1984): 
𝐷𝐷= 3
2
𝑉
𝐴𝑝
  
[5-17] 
where 𝑉 is the volume of a particle and 𝐴𝑝 is its projected area. Therefore, using the drag 
diameter, the projected area of the leading bubble can be expressed as: 
𝐴𝑝𝑦= 𝜋
4 (𝐷𝑆𝑚
𝐷𝐷
)
𝑦
𝜑𝑦3𝐷𝑆𝑚𝑦
2
 
[5-18] 
Here, (𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷
⁄
)𝑦 is a drag shape factor for the leading bubble “y.” Recall that a similar shape 
factor occurs in standard drag force component of the generalized interfacial drag given by 
Equation [1-7]. Physically, the shape factor (𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷
⁄
) is proportional to the ratio of the bubble’s 

219 
 
projected area to its surface area. 𝜑𝑦 is the shape factor for the leading bubble “y” that is defined 
according to Equation [2-46] (i.e. 𝜑𝑦= 𝐷𝑒𝑦/𝐷𝑆𝑚𝑦). If the leading particle is spherical, these 
shape factors are equal to one. Expressions for these shape factors for some approximate bubble 
shapes are provided in Appendix D. 
 
This generalized form of the wake-entrainment coalescence rate will be used in Sections 
5.2.2 through 5.2.4 to establish the required wake-entrainment source/sink terms for a two-group 
interfacial area transport model capable of achieving dynamic transition from one-group to two-
group flows. In addition to establishing models for the characteristic surface area and volume 
changes and the coalescence rate, supporting models for parameters such as the bubble number 
densities, drag coefficients, and relative velocities have to be determined to complete the 
development of the void fraction and interfacial area concentration source/sink terms.    
5.2.2 Intergroup Wake Entrainment (11,2) 
5.2.2.1 Approach  
One-group flows are predominately occupied by smaller group-I bubbles with the group-I 
Sauter-mean diameter as their characteristic length scale. Even though there is a chance that 
larger group-I bubbles could coalesce with each other to form a group-II bubble in a single 
interaction, it is more likely that coalescences will occur between the few larger group-I bubbles 
and the more numerous average group-I bubbles. Therefore, instead of viewing the wake 
entrainment (11,2) mechanism as a single coalescence interaction between two group-I bubbles to 
produce a group-II bubble, consider the generation of a group-II bubble as the result of an 
evolutionary process that consists of a series of successive coalescence interactions between a 
large group-I bubble and average group-I bubbles. A schematic of such a process is depicted in 

220 
 
Figure 5-3. In the first stage of the wake entrainment (11,2) process, a large group-I bubble with 
volume 𝑉𝑦 is the leading bubble in a wake-entrainment interaction with a following average 
group-I bubble. Define 𝑉𝑦 as a fraction 𝛽 of the bubble size at the group boundary such that: 
𝑉𝑦= 𝛽𝑉𝑐 
[5-19] 
The resultant bubble from the first stage has volume 𝑉𝑦+ 𝑉̅1
(1), where 𝑉̅1
(1) is the volume of the 
average group-I bubble during the first stage. In subsequent stages, the resultant bubble from the 
previous stage is the leading bubble. One can identify this bubble as the large bubble from the 
first stage having undergone a series of coalesces with following average group-I bubbles.
 
Although the size of the following average group-I bubbles may increase in successive 
stages, this change is small in comparison to the bubble size at the group boundary. Therefore, 
assume that the following bubble in each stage is approximately the same size such that:   
𝑉̅1
(1) ≈𝑉̅1
(2) ≈𝑉̅1
(3) ≈⋯≈𝑉̅1
(𝑁) ≈𝑉̅1 
[5-20] 
Furthermore, assume that the bubble produced at the final stage of the wake entrainment (11,2) 
process has a volume approximately equal to the critical bubble volume. In this way, this 
mechanism is limited to producing group-II bubbles that are just at the group boundary. Although 
it is possible for various combinations of group-I bubbles to coalesce and produce a spectrum of 
group-II bubbles with volumes ranging from 𝑉𝑐 to twice the maximum group-I bubble volume in 
the flow, as previously discussed the population of larger group-I bubbles is expected to be 
minimal compared to the population of average group-I bubbles.  Moreover, the microscopic 
details of the group-II bubble size distribution that is produced in transition is not of interest in a 
macroscopic two-phase flow model. Therefore, it is sufficient to consider that this mechanism 

221 
 
just produces group-II bubbles at the boundary. With this assumption and defining the larger 
group-I bubble from the first stage with Equation [5-19], one can express the number of stages in 
the process (𝑁) in terms of the average group-I bubble volume, the critical volume, and 𝛽 as: 
𝑁≈(1 −𝛽) 𝑉𝑐
𝑉̅1
 
[5-21] 
 
Figure 5-3: Schematic representation of the wake entrainment (11,2) mechanism as an 
evolutionary process.  
 

222 
 
The size of the leading bubble in the first stage of the wake entrainment (11,2) process is 
determined by the value of 𝛽. Because this leading bubble is at least the same size as the average 
group-I bubble and the mechanism is assumed to only produce bubbles at the group boundary, 𝛽 
is bounded by: 
𝑉̅1
𝑉𝑐
≤𝛽≤1 −𝑉̅1
𝑉𝑐
 
[5-22] 
Assume that 𝛽 is given by the average of these two bounds, which yields: 
𝛽= 0.5 
[5-23] 
𝛽= 0.5 has physical significance in view of progressing from a pure one-group flow into 
transition. When the largest group-I bubbles in the flow are less than half of the critical bubble 
volume at the group boundary, there is no chance of producing group-II through binary 
coalescence interactions. As soon as group-I bubbles are available that have volumes greater than 
half the critical volume, there is a finite chance that group-II can be produced. Therefore, it is 
natural to assume that the wake entrainment (11,2) process can be considered to become 
important when large group-I bubbles with volumes around 0.5𝑉𝐶 become available in the flow 
since this corresponds to the first chance of producing group-II.  
It is interesting to note that viewing the wake entrainment (11,2) mechanism as an 
evolutionary process reflects the structure of group-I bubble clusters that are observed in the 
experiments at the initiation of transition. Figure 5-4 shows an example of clusters of group-I 
bubbles rising through the center of the pipe. As these clusters of group-I bubbles travel up the 
pipe, they move in a similar fashion to small cap bubbles. Thus, even though they have not 
formed true group-II bubbles, they share some group-II transport characteristics. This supports 
the concept of group-II production as an evolutionary rather than instantaneous process.

5.2.2.2 Characteristic Surface Area and Volume Changes 
In view of the wake entrainment (11,2) process outlined in Section 5.2.2.1, the 
characteristic surface area and volume changes that are required to specify the models for the 
𝜙𝑊𝐸,1
(11,2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2), and 𝜂𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) source/sink terms are obtained by computing the arithmetic mean of 
the surface area and volume changes to each group from each stage of the process. In this way, 
the resulting average surface area and volume changes over the entire wake entrainment (11,2) 
process indicate what fraction of the actual transfer to group-II that occurs in the final stage can 
be attributed to the separate stages of the process. In doing so, the average surface area and 
volume changes can be associated with the interaction rate of the first stage of the process to 
formulate the 𝜙𝑊𝐸,1
(11,2), 𝜙𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2), and 𝜂𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) source/sink terms. 
Actual volume transfer from group-I to group-II only occurs at the last stage of the wake 
entrainment (11,2) process. If we average the volume that is transferred over the series of 
coalescences, we essentially compute a fraction of the final volume transfer that can be attributed 
to each stage. Assuming that a group-II bubble of volume 𝑉𝑐 is produced in the last stage, the 
average characteristic volume change for the (11,2) wake entrainment process is given as: 
(Δ𝑉)𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) = 1
𝑁∑(Δ𝑉)2𝑗
𝑁
𝑗=1
= 𝑉𝑐
𝑁=
𝑉̅1
1 −𝛽 
[5-24] 
where (Δ𝑉)2𝑗 indicates the volume change for group-II at the jth stage of the process. Note that 
Equation [5-21] has been used to specify 𝑁 in evaluating Equation [5-24]. Likewise, averaging 
the changes in the group-II surface area over the entire process yields the average characteristic 
surface area change for group-II for the (11,2) wake entrainment process as: 

225 
 
(Δ𝐴𝑖)𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) = 1
𝑁∑(Δ𝐴𝑖)2𝑗
𝑁
𝑗=1
= 𝐴𝑖𝑐
𝑁 
[5-25] 
where 𝐴𝑖𝑐 is the surface area of a bubble at the group boundary, which can be expressed as: 
𝐴𝑖𝑐= 𝐴𝑖𝑐(𝑉𝑐) = (36𝜋)1 3
⁄ 𝜑𝑐𝑉𝑐
2 3
⁄  
[5-26] 
Since different shapes are assumed for the bubbles in each group, the bubble shape factor is 
discontinuous at the group boundary. Therefore, the shape factor for bubbles at the group 
boundary (𝜑𝑐) is approximated as the average of the group-I and group-II bubble shape factors as: 
𝜑𝑐= 𝜑1 + 𝜑2
2
 
[5-27] 
For spherical group-I bubbles and spherical-cap group-II bubbles with a wake angle of 50°, 
𝜑𝑐≈1.3.  
 
Using Equation [5-21] for 𝑁 and Equation [5-26] for 𝐴𝑖𝑐 in Equation [5-25] and 
assuming 𝑉̅1~𝐷𝑆𝑚1
3
, Equation [5-25] can be rewritten as: 
(Δ𝐴𝑖)𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) ≈𝜋𝐷𝑆𝑚1

[5-28] 
 where the non-dimensional group-I Sauter mean diameter (𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗
) is defined as: 
𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗
= 𝐷𝑆𝑚1
𝐷𝑐
 
[5-29] 
Equation [5-28] indicates that (Δ𝐴𝑖)𝑊𝐸,2
(11,2) increases linearly with 𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗
 and the characteristic 
surface area change is proportional to the average group-I surface area. Thus, as the average 

226 
 
group-I size grows towards the group boundary, the characteristic surface area gain for group-II 
increases, which is consistent. 
 
Now consider averaging the surface area change for group-I at each stage. For stages 
𝑗= 1, … , (𝑁−1), (Δ𝐴𝑖)1𝑗 is due to intragroup coalescence interactions and can be expressed as: 
(Δ𝐴𝑖)1𝑗= (36𝜋)1 3
⁄ [(𝑗𝑉̅1 + 𝛽𝑉𝑐)2 3

⁄
−((𝑗−1) + 𝛽𝑉𝑐
𝑉̅1

2 3
⁄

[5-30] 
For stage 𝑁, (Δ𝐴𝑖)1𝑁 is due to an intergroup transfer to group-II and is given by: 
(Δ𝐴𝑖)1𝑁= −(36𝜋)1 3
⁄ [((𝑁−1)𝑉̅1 + 𝛽𝑉𝑐)

[5-31]

Lastly, note that even though 𝛽 has been retained in the formulation of these terms in the interest 
of generality, 𝛽 is regarded as a model constant equal to 0.5 in view of the physical significance 
of this value in the transition process starting from a pure one-group flow as discussed in Section 
5.2.2.1.   

228 
 
5.2.2.3 Interaction Rate 
Assume that the interaction rate for the (11,2) mechanism is proportional to the 
interaction rate for the first stage of the series of coalescences. With the characteristic surface area 
and volume changes computed as averages over the process, we have approximately accounted 
for the fact that we are not necessarily considering the transfer to group-II through a single 
interaction but through an evolutionary process. Considering the general wake entrainment 
interaction rate developed in Section 5.2.1, the larger group-I bubble in the wake entrainment 
(11,2) process described in Section 5.2.2.1 is the leading “y” bubble, and the average group-I 
bubble is the following bubble “x”. Therefore, 𝑅𝑊𝐸
(11,2) can be expressed as: 
𝑅𝑊𝐸
(11,2)~(3
2 𝜋1 3
⁄ )(𝐶𝐷𝑦
1 3
⁄ 𝑛1𝑛𝑦𝐴𝑝𝑦𝑢𝑟𝑦)  
[5-40] 
where 𝑛1 is the group-I bubble number density, which is representative of the average group-I 
bubble. 𝑛𝑦 is the number density of larger group-I bubbles that are available to start the wake-
entrainment (11,2) process leading to the production of group-II. Likewise, 𝐶𝐷𝑦, 𝐴𝑝𝑦, and 𝑢𝑟𝑦 are 
the drag coefficient, projected area, and relative velocity of the large group-I bubble. 
 
The parameters that describe the large, leading group-I bubble (i.e. 𝑛𝑦, 𝐶𝐷𝑦, 𝐴𝑝𝑦, and 
𝑢𝑟𝑦) are not readily available in a solution of the two-fluid model with the interfacial area 
transport equation Therefore, Equation [5-40] is recast in terms of known group-I parameters by 
multiplying and dividing by 𝐶𝐷1
1 3
⁄ 𝑛1𝐴𝑝1𝑢𝑟1 to yield:      
𝑅𝑊𝐸

Observe that if 𝐴𝑝1 is replaced with 𝜋𝐷𝑆𝑚1
2
4
⁄ ,  the second collection of terms in parentheses is 
the same to within a numerical constant as the one-group wake entrainment interaction rate 
developed by Kim (1999). The collection of terms in the brackets represents the difference in the 
wake entrainment rate of the large group-I bubble compared to the average group-I bubble. This 
collection of terms should be expressed in terms of available parameters to complete the 
specification of 𝑅𝑊𝐸
(11,2). 
 
To evaluate the collection of terms in brackets in Equation [5-41], let the drag 
coefficients for the large leading group-I bubble (𝐶𝐷𝑦) and the average group-I bubble (𝐶𝐷1)  be 
given by the distorted fluid particle regime drag coefficient correlation for gas bubbles in liquid 
as (Ishii and Chawla,1979; Ishii and Zuber, 1979): 
𝐶𝐷𝑦= 2

𝜎(1 −𝛼1)−1/2 
[5-43] 
Note that in addition to evaluating the collection of terms in brackets in Equation [5-41], a model 
for 𝐶𝐷1 is required to complete the specification of 𝑅𝑊𝐸
(11,2). It is recommended to use the 
approximate form for 𝐶𝐷1 given by the second expression in Equation [5-43] in view of 
simplifying the model. Likewise, this drag coefficient should be used in the intragroup group-I 
coalesce sink term as well. Note that the function(s) of void fraction in the distorted particle drag 
model account for the increased drag a particle “sees” due to the surrounding particles in a multi-
particle system (Ishii and Chawla,1979; Ishii and Zuber, 1979). Since the group-I bubbles are 
primarily influenced by other surrounding group-I bubbles, the group-I void fraction is used in 
the drag coefficient expression instead of the total void fraction. 

230 
 
 
In view of Equation [5-19], the large, leading group-I bubble diameter (𝐷𝑦) can be 
specified as: 
𝐷𝑦= 𝛽1 3
⁄ 𝐷𝑐 
[5-44] 
 With Equation [5-44], the ratio of 𝐶𝐷𝑦 to 𝐶𝐷1 is given by: 
𝐶𝐷𝑦
𝐶𝐷1
= 𝛽1 3
⁄
𝐷𝑐
𝐷𝑆𝑚1
 
[5-45] 
 
Now, considering the force balance between drag, buoyancy, and gravity, the relative 
velocities for the large, leading group-I bubble (𝑢𝑟𝑦) and the average group-I bubble (𝑢𝑟1) can be 
written as: 
𝑢𝑟𝑦= √2𝑔Δ𝜌(1 −𝛼)𝑉𝑦
𝐶𝐷𝑦𝜌𝑓𝐴𝑝𝑦
 
[5-46] 
𝑢𝑟1 = √2𝑔𝛥𝜌(1 −𝛼)𝑉̅1
𝐶𝐷1𝜌𝑓𝐴𝑝1
 
[5-47] 
Thus, the ratio of 𝑢𝑟𝑦 to 𝑢𝑟1 can be written as:

[5-48] 
Using Equations [5-45] and [5-48] along with the definition of the drag diameter given by 
Equation [5-17] and assuming 𝑉̅1~𝐷𝑆𝑚1
3
, one can show that the collection of terms in the brackets 
in Equation [5-41] can be written as: 

231

[5-49] 
Observe that the term inside the brackets on the right-hand side of Equation [5-49] is a ratio of 
drag shape factors for the large leading group group-I bubble and the average group-I bubble. 
Group-I bubbles become more distorted with increasing size, so their drag shape factor may 
deviate from unity. However, since a ratio of drag shape factors appears in Equation [5-49], this 
term can be regarded as close to one, and its effect will be included in the model coefficient. The 
remaining factor of (𝛽1 3

𝐷𝑆𝑚1

)
7/3 acts to scale up the interaction rate that is written in terms of 
the smaller average group-I bubble parameters. Thus, the interaction rate can be expressed as:

To complete the specification of 𝑅𝑊𝐸
(11,2), models are required for 𝑛1, 𝐴𝑝1, 𝑢𝑟1, and the 
ratio 𝑛𝑦𝑛1

. The group-I bubble number density (𝑛1) can be estimated as (Kim, 1999): 
𝑛1 = 𝜓1 (𝑎𝑖1

[5-51] 
Since the average group-I particles are assumed to be spherical, the group-I bubble projected area 
(𝐴𝑝1) reduces to: 
𝐴𝑝1 = 𝜋
4 𝐷𝑆𝑚1
2
 
[5-52] 
For the group-I relative velocity, Equation [5-47] can be recast into a more conventional form as 
(Ishii and Chawla, 1979): 

232 
 
𝑢𝑟1 = √4𝑔Δ𝜌(1 −𝛼)𝐷𝑆𝑚1
3𝐶𝐷1𝜌𝑓(𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷
⁄

[5-53] 
Note that the void fraction in Equation [5-53] is the total void fraction since it is related to the 
buoyancy force. Although included for generality in Equation [5-53], the drag shape factor group-
I bubbles, (𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷
⁄
)1is assumed to be unity since the group-I bubbles are regarded as spheres.
 
Lastly, the ratio of the number density of the large, leading group-I bubble to the group-I 
number density represents the probability that the large group-I bubble is available in the flow to 
initiate the wake-entrainment (11, 2) process that produces a group-II bubble. This probability 
depends on the group-I bubble size distribution, which is not known in terms of basic two-phase 
flow parameters. However, in view of the experiments in Chapter 3, the group-I bubble Sauter-
mean diameter can be used as an indicator for when large group-I bubbles become present in to 
flow to initiate transition. In order to develop a transition model that is scalable to other systems, 
the non-dimensional group-I bubble Sauter-mean diameter defined by Equation [5-29] is selected 
as the controlling parameter to develop a transition function  𝑇(𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗
) to account for the 
probability that larger group-I bubbles become available in the flow. Thus: 
(𝑛𝑦

[5-54] 
A model for 𝑇(𝐷𝑆𝑚1

function and introducing a coefficient of proportionality, the final expression for the wake-
entrainment (11,2) interaction rate is given as:

5.2.2.4 Transition Function: 𝑻(𝑫𝑺𝒎𝟏
∗
) 
 
As discussed in Section 5.2.2.3 a model is required for the probability that a larger group-
I bubble is available in the flow for the wake entrainment (11,2) process to occur. A detailed 
description of this probability requires knowledge of the bubble size distribution, which is not 
readily attainable. Therefore, a simple approach is developed in the present study to increase the 
importance of the wake-entrainment (11,2) mechanism as the average group-I bubble size 
increases. First, consider the average group-I bubble volume non-dimensionalized by the critical 
bubble volume at the group boundary, i.e. 𝑉̅1
∗= 𝑉̅1/𝑉𝑐. When 𝑉̅1
∗ increases beyond a transition 
average bubble size (𝑉̅1,𝑡𝑟
∗), large group-I bubbles with non-dimensional volume 𝛽 become 
available to initiate the wake-entrainment (11,2) process. As 𝑉̅1
∗ continues to increase towards 𝛽, 
it becomes certain that wake-entrainment (11,2) will occur. Therefore, we seek a function 𝑇(𝑉̅1
∗) 
for the wake-entrainment (11,2) interaction rate with the following behavior:  
𝑇(𝑉̅1
∗⟶𝑉̅1,𝑡𝑟
∗) ⟶≈0 
[5-56] 
𝑇(𝑉̅1
∗⟶𝛽) ⟶≈1 
[5-57] 
One such function that has this behavior is the logistic function (Stewart, 2007), which in terms of 
non-dimensional group-I bubble volumes is given as: 
𝑇(𝑉̅1
∗) =
1
1 + exp[𝑘(𝑉̅1,𝑜
∗−𝑉̅1
∗)]  
[5-58] 
where 𝑉̅1,𝑜
∗ is the center of the transition region between the non-dimensional volumes 𝑉̅1,𝑡𝑟
∗ and 𝛽    
where 𝑇(𝑉̅1,𝑜
∗) = 0.5, and 𝑘 is the slope. 

234 
 
 
To specify 𝑘 and 𝑉̅1,𝑜
∗ in terms of 𝑉̅1,𝑡𝑟
∗ and 𝛽, a relaxation factor (𝑎) is introduced such 
that: 
𝑇(𝑉̅1,𝑡𝑟
∗) =  𝑎 
[5-59] 
𝑇(𝛽) =  1 −𝑎 
[5-60] 
Using this, 𝑇(𝑉̅1
∗) can be expressed as: 
𝑇(𝑉̅1
∗) = [1 + (
𝑎
1 −𝑎)
𝑉̅1,𝑡𝑟
∗
+𝛽−2𝑉̅1∗
𝑉̅1,𝑡𝑟
∗
+𝛽−1 ]
−1
 
[5-61] 
 
Conceptually, it is convenient to develop the transition function in terms of bubble 
volume. However, for application it should be expressed in terms of appropriate bubble length 
scales. Since 𝑉̅1~𝐷𝑆𝑚1
3
 and 𝑉𝑐~ 𝐷𝑐3, the final form of the transition function is given as:  
𝑇(𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗
) = [1 + (
𝑎
1 −𝑎)
ℎ(𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗
)
]
−1
 
[5-62] 
where ℎ(𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗
) is given by: 
ℎ(𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗

∗3
+ 𝛽−2𝐷𝑆𝑚1
∗3
𝐷𝑆𝑚1,𝑡𝑟
∗3
+ 𝛽−1
 
[5-63] 
 
In view of the experiments discussed in Chapter 3, it is postulated that the non-
dimensional group-I bubble Sauter-mean diameter can be used as an indicator of the importance 
of wake-dominated bubble transport to initiate the transition from purely one-group flows to two-
group flows. Therefore, the non-dimensional transition group-I Sauter-mean diameter (𝐷𝑆𝑚1,𝑡𝑟
∗
) is 

235 
 
suggested to characterize when large group-I bubbles become available in the flow to initiate the 
transition process: 
𝐷𝑆𝑚1,𝑡𝑟
∗
= 𝐷𝑆𝑚1,𝑡𝑟
𝐷𝑐
= 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡. 
[5-64] 
Furthermore, it is proposed that the non-dimensional transition group-I Sauter-mean diameter is a 
constant that can be applied in other flows. By fixing 𝐷𝑆𝑚1,𝑡𝑟
∗
 as a constant, the present transition 
model will adjust accordingly for different values of 𝐷𝑐. This assumption should be assessed in 
future work through experimental studies in systems with different 𝐷𝑐. It is speculated that this 
assumption will hold if the bubble volume distribution in pure one-group flows has similar 
characteristics for different 𝐷𝑐. In other words, if the bubble volume distribution grows in a 
similar manner in other flows, this transition model with fixed 𝐷𝑆𝑚1,𝑡𝑟
∗
, which can be determined 
based on the present air-water experiments, should be useable in other flows with different 𝐷𝑐.

5.2.3 Intergroup Wake Entrainment (12,2) 
In view of the general wake entrainment interaction rate developed in Section 5.2.1, 
consider a group-II bubble is the leading “y” bubble and a group-I bubble as the following “x” 
bubble. The number density of group-I bubbles represents the number of group-I bubbles per unit 
mixture volume. As group-II bubbles become present in the flow, they exclude volume that the 
group-I bubbles can occupy. This results in an effective increase in the following group-I bubble 
number density in the wake regions of group-II bubbles. Accounting for this effect, the number 
density of the following group-I bubbles can be estimated as: 
𝑛𝑥=
𝑛1
1 −𝛼2
 
[5-65] 
Thus, the wake entrainment coalescence rate of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles can be 
expressed as:

The shape factor (𝐷𝑆𝑚/𝐷𝑒)2 is assumed to be approximated by that for a spherical-cap bubble 
with a wake angle of 50°, i.e. (𝐷𝑆𝑚/𝐷𝑒)2 ≈1/1.7.   

237 
 
 
Since the base diameter of a group-II bubble is restricted by the duct length scale in a 
moderate size duct, the projected area of the leading group-II bubble is defined as the minimum 
of either the projected area of a cap bubble or the cross-sectional area of the duct as:

where the group-II drag shape factor (𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷

spherical-cap bubble. For a wake angle of 50°, 𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑐𝑎𝑝𝐷𝐷,𝑐𝑎𝑝

≈1.804; the expression for 
𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑐𝑎𝑝𝐷𝐷,𝑐𝑎𝑝

 as a function of wake angle is provided in Appendix D. Thus, even though the 
group-II bubbles are assumed to be cap-shaped in the present development, this treatment on the 
group-II projected area for wake-entrainment will yield the correct limiting behavior as an 
established two-group flow develops where group-II bubbles ultimately fill the pipe cross-section. 
Considering the force balance among the drag, pressure and gravity forces (Ishii and 
Chawla, 1979), the group-II bubble relative velocity (𝑢𝑟2) can be estimated as:  
𝑢𝑟2 = √
4𝑔Δ𝜌(1 −𝛼)𝐷𝑆𝑚2

[5-69] 
where group-II drag coefficient (𝐶𝐷2) can be calculated from the drag coefficient for the churn 
turbulent flow regime (Ishii and Chawla,1979; Ishii and Zuber, 1979) as:  
𝐶𝐷2 = 8
3 (1 −𝛼2)2 
[5-70] 
Since the group-II drag coefficient is a function of the group-II void fraction, the group-II relative 
velocity given by Equation [5-69] takes into account the effects of increasing void fraction on the 
relative motion of group-II bubbles in the two-phase mixture. 

238 
 
 
Considering the coalescence of an average group-I bubble with an average group-II 
bubble, the characteristic surface area and volume changes for the intergroup wake entrainment of 
group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles are determined to be:

Equation [5-71] indicates that the characteristic surface area change to group-I for this 
interaction is a loss of the average group-I surface area. Likewise, Equation [5-73] indicates that 
that the characteristic volume change is a gain of an average group-I bubble volume by group-II, 
which corresponds to an equal loss by group-I. Interestingly, Equation [5-72] shows that the 
surface area gain by group-II is proportional to the average surface area of group-II and the 
relative size of group-I to group-II bubbles. The interfacial area concentration and void fraction 
source/sink terms are given as a product of the interaction rate for this mechanism and the 
corresponding characteristic surface area and/or volume changes as prescribed in Table 5-2. 
5.2.4 Intragroup Wake Entrainment (22,2) 
As observed in the experiments, the group-II interfacial area concentration demonstrates 
a decreasing trend along the test section as the one-group to two-group transition progresses 

239 
 
towards more established group-II flows. This also corresponds to a decrease in the group-II 
bubble number frequency, indicating intragroup coalescence of group-II bubbles. Owing to the 
moderate size of the test section, the group-II bubble motion is restricted in the lateral direction, 
such that group-II bubbles primarily interact with each other and group-I bubbles in their wake 
regions. Figure 5-6 shows and example of a following cap bubble approaching a leading cap 
bubble. Using the general wake entrainment interaction rate developed in Section 5.2.1, the 
interaction rate for intragroup wake entrainment between two group-II bubbles to form a group-II 
bubble is given by: 
𝑅𝑊𝐸

where 𝑛2, 𝐴𝑝2, and 𝑢𝑟2 are given in Section 5.2.3. 
Considering the coalescence of two average group-II bubbles, the characteristic change in 
group-II surface area for this interaction can be given as:  
(Δ𝐴𝑖)𝑊𝐸

[5-75] 
Thus, the group-II interfacial area concentration sink due to intragroup wake entrainment is given 
by the product of Equations [5-74] and [5-75]. Since this is an intragroup interaction, the 
corresponding void source/sink term is zero.

5.2.5 Intergroup Shearing-Off (2,12) 
As observed in the experiments, the beginning stages of one-group to two-group 
transition are characterized by decreasing interfacial area concentration and noticeable transfer of 
void fraction from group-I to group-II. However, as the transition progresses and an established 
two-group flow structure develops, the interfacial area concentration begins to increase again. As 
an initial attempt to capture this behavior, the available shearing-off model developed by Fu 
(2001) is used. As pointed out in Chapter 4, the liquid film velocity reduction factor (𝜅𝑓𝑟) in Fu’s 
(2001) model has inconsistent units. This term was developed to account for the effect of wall 
friction on the falling film around an elongated slug bubble. Since the present transition 
conditions still represent cap-bubbly flows transitioning towards an established two-group 
structure, it is assumed that this effect can be neglected. In fact, evaluating 𝜅𝑓𝑟 as given by Fu 
(2001) for the present experimental conditions yields a value very close to one. Therefore, 𝜅𝑓𝑟 is 
set to one for use in the present model.  The formulation of the relative interfacial velocity at the 
bases of group-II bubbles in both transition and established group-II flow conditions should be 
investigated further in future work to establish a robust shearing-off model. 
As a first step towards developing a shearing-off model that activates once a sufficient 
group-II bubble size is achieved, a treatment similar to the one-group turbulence impact breakup 
mechanism is employed. A modification factor as a function of the group-II bubble Weber 
number (𝑊𝑒2) is given as:  
𝑔(𝑊𝑒2) =
{  
  √1 −𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟2
𝑊𝑒2
   ,   𝑓𝑜𝑟   𝑊𝑒2 > 𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟2 
0       ,    𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒
 
[5-76] 
The Weber number is chosen as a governing parameter since it represents the ratio of the inertia 
force to the surface tension force. The group-II Sauter-mean diameter is the natural group-II 

242 
 
bubble length scale in the context of a two-phase flow simulation with the interfacial area 
transport equation since it can be readily calculated from the group-II void fraction and interfacial 
area concentration. Since the shearing-off mechanism is related to the relative motion of the 
group-II bubbles, the group-II relative velocity is employed as the velocity scale for one-group to 
two-group transition flows. Thus, the group-II bubble Weber number is defined as:  
𝑊𝑒2 = 𝜌𝑓𝑢𝑟2
2 𝐷𝑆𝑚2
𝜎
 
[5-77] 
𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟2 is the critical group-II bubble Weber number for shearing-off to occur, which should be 
determined through experiment. The modification factor given by Equation [5-76] is multiplied to 
the available shearing-off interfacial area concentration and void fraction source/sink terms, 
𝜙𝑆𝑂,1
(2,12), 𝜙𝑆𝑂,2
(2,12), and 𝜂𝑆𝑂,2
(2,12), (Fu, 2001) that were presented in Chapter 4. When the group-II 
bubble Weber number is less than the critical group-II Weber number, the modification factor 
zeros the shearing-off mechanism. As the group-II bubble Weber number increases beyond the 
critical Weber number, the importance of the shearing-off mechanism increases.  
 
To gain a sense of the order of magnitude of the group-II Weber number, Equation [5-77] 
is evaluated assuming that the void fraction is equal to zero in the relative velocity expression. 
The Weber number is then evaluated with 𝐷𝑆𝑚2 = 𝐷𝑐 and 𝐷𝑆𝑚2 = 𝐷ℎ. Doing so yields Weber 
numbers of ~7 and ~170, respectively. Thus, we can expect the critical Weber number to be 
within these bounds.  
5.2.6 Modification of One-Group Models for Two-Group Flows 
At the beginning of transition from a one-group to two-group flow, the flow 
predominately consists of group-I bubbles. Therefore, the one-group bubble interaction 

243 
 
mechanisms previously developed (Wu et al., 1998, Kim, 1999) for turbulence impact breakup, 
random collision coalescence, and wake entrainment are still valid, but the models should be 
expressed in terms of group-I parameters. However, as the transition progresses and the flow 
becomes more populated with group-II bubbles, the flow structure progressively deviates from 
the pure one-group flow structure that was assumed in developing the one-group models. 
Moreover, as an established group-II flow structure develops, wake entrainment of group-I 
bubbles into group-II bubbles becomes the major sink to the group-I interfacial area concentration 
and shearing-off becomes the dominant source. Therefore, it is postulated that although 
intragroup random collision, wake entrainment, and turbulence impact of group-I bubbles do 
likely occur in established two-group flows, their contribution to the change in interfacial area 
concentration is not as significant compared to shearing-off and intergroup wake entrainment 
(12,2). Therefore, the importance of the one-group bubble interaction mechanisms should 
diminish as an established two-group flow develops. 
To achieve this, the one-group bubble interaction source/sink terms are written as:  
𝜙𝑇𝐼

(1), and 𝐶𝑊𝐸

group models. A factor of [1 −𝑔(𝑊𝑒2)] is also included in the wake-entrainment (11,2) 
interaction rate so that this mechanism diminishes in importance as well with the other one-group 
interactions. Thus, as an established two-group flow structure develops, the importance of the 
one-group bubble interaction mechanisms diminishes in the two-group interfacial area transport 
equations. If the flow were to move away from an established two-group flow structure back 
towards a pure one-group flow, the importance of the one-group mechanisms would naturally 
increase. 
5.3 Chapter Summary 
In this Chapter the necessary bubble interaction source/sink term models to achieve 
dynamic transition from one-group to two-group flows with the two-group interfacial area 
transport equation were developed. The framework of one-group to two-group transition flows 
was established. The increasing importance of wake-dominant bubble transport was identified as 
the characteristic of the initiation of transition. As the transition progresses towards a more 
established two-group flow structure the interfacial area concentration increases due to increasing 

245 
 
activity of the shearing-off mechanism. In an established two-group flow, shearing-off and wake 
entrainment become the major source and sink, respectively, to the interfacial area concentration. 
With this framework in mind, the following efforts were made to establish the required models 
for a two-group interfacial area transport model applicable to one-group to two-group transition 
flows: 
 
 
A general wake entrainment interaction rate model was established to serve as the basis 
for developing the required source/sink terms for one-group to two-group transition 
flows. 
 
 
Intergroup wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles to form group-II bubbles was considered 
as an evolutionary process to develop the necessary interfacial area concentration and 
void fraction source/sink terms to achieve dynamic transition from one-group to two-
group flows. 
 
 
Interfacial area concentration and void fraction source/sink terms for intergroup wake 
entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles were developed. This is a major 
mechanism that drives the one-group to two-group transition and becomes the major sink 
to the interfacial area concentration in established two-group flows. 
 
 
A model for the interfacial area concentration sink term due to intragroup coalescence of 
group-II bubbles was developed. 
 
 
The available shearing-off model (Fu, 2001) was modified to include a function of the 
group-II bubble Weber number so that it would become active as an established two-
group flow structure develops. This treatment prevents non-physical shearing-off at the 
initiation of transition. 

246 
 
 
The existing intragroup turbulence impact, random collision, and wake entrainment 
models for group-I bubbles were revised to include a function of the group-II bubble 
Weber number to diminish their importance as an established two-group flow develops. 
This treatment was also included in the newly developed wake-entrainment (11,2) 
source/sink terms. 

247 
 
  
Chapter 6
 
Evaluation of Interfacial Area Transport Model 
for One-Group to Two-Group Transition Flows 
The interfacial area transport source/sink term models developed in Chapter 5 are 
evaluated in this Chapter against the one-group to two-group transition test conditions that were 
established in Chapter 3. Two-phase flows are commonly analyzed in a one-dimensional (i.e. 
cross-sectional averaged) sense such as in nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulic system analysis 
codes like TRACE and RELAP (TRACE v5.0 Theory Manual, 2007; RELAP5-3D Code Manual, 
2005). Therefore, in view of the practical significance of a one-dimensional model, the two-group 
interfacial area transport model is evaluated in one-dimensional form, assuming that the flow is in 
a steady-state condition. Furthermore, since the experiments were performed in adiabatic air-
water two-phase flows, the terms associated with phase change are neglected. Section 6.1 outlines 
the evaluation approach. This includes discussion of the governing equations, assumptions, and 
the numerical solution procedure in a MATLAB program that was developed to solve the steady-
state, one-dimensional, two-group continuity and interfacial area transport equations for adiabatic 
two-phase flows. Section 6.2 discusses the results of the evaluation against experimental data. 
6.1 Model Evaluation Approach 
6.1.1 Governing Equations 
 
The steady-state, one-dimensional group continuity equations for adiabatic two-phase 
flows are given as: 
 

248 
 
∂〈𝛼1〉𝜌𝑔〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉
∂z
= 〈𝑚1〉 
[6-1] 
∂〈𝛼1〉𝜌𝑔〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉
∂z
= 〈𝑚2〉 
[6-2] 
Note that it is assumed that the density of the gas phase is uniform in the duct cross-section (i.e. 
𝜌𝑔= 〈𝜌𝑔〉), which implies that the pressure is also assumed to be uniform over the cross-section.  
Note that the following relationships are required to satisfy total continuity of the gas phase: 
〈𝑚1〉+ 〈𝑚2〉= 0 
[6-3] 
〈𝛼〉= 〈𝛼1〉+ 〈𝛼2〉 
[6-4] 
〈〈𝑣𝑔〉〉=
〈𝛼1〉〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉+ 〈𝛼2〉〈〈𝑣𝑔2〉〉
〈𝛼〉
 
[6-5] 
 
Once the group-I bubble length scale reaches a certain size, which is less than the bubble 
length scale at the group boundary, there will be a possibility that the coalescence of group-I 
bubbles will form group-II bubbles. Once group-II bubbles are formed, intergroup wake-
entrainment between group-I and group-II bubbles drives the transition to established two-group 
flow. Therefore, it is unlikely that a significant amount of group-I bubbles will reach a size close 
to that at the group boundary. In view of this, it is assumed that the effects of intergroup 
expansion/contraction are negligible in the two-group interfacial area transport equations for the 
adiabatic flows under consideration. As such, the factor 𝜒 in the two-group interfacial area 
transport equations and intergroup mass transfer rates will be assumed to be zero in the present 

249 
 
development. However, this assumption may need to be revisited depending on the flow under 
consideration. For example, in heated flows the effects of evaporation/condensation may lead to 
significant intergroup expansion/contraction across the group boundary. Likewise, a rapid flow 
transient that causes a sudden increase/decrease in the pressure could also lead to a significant 
effect from intergroup expansion/contraction.  In such cases, modeling of the particle volume 
distribution (i.e. 𝜒𝑉𝑐/𝑉̅ and 𝜒𝐴𝑖𝑐/𝐴̅𝑖1) should be considered to properly include the effects of 
intergroup expansion/contraction. However, these cases are beyond the scope of the present work. 
 
In view of neglecting the effects of intergroup expansion/contraction (i.e. 𝜒= 0), the 
intergroup mass transfer rate in the continuity equations is due only to intergroup bubble 
interactions and is given as: 
〈𝑚2〉= 𝜌𝑔∑〈𝜂𝑗,2
𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟〉
𝑗
 
[6-6] 
 
Furthermore, neglecting the intergroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms (i.e. 
𝜒= 0), the steady-state, one-dimensional two-group interfacial area transport equations for 
adiabatic two-phase flow are given as: 
𝜕〈𝑎𝑖1〉〈〈𝑣𝑖1〉〉𝑎𝑖
𝜕𝑧
= 2
3 (
〈𝑎𝑖1〉
〈𝛼1〉) {−
〈𝛼1〉〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉
𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝑧} + ∑〈𝜙𝑗,1〉
𝑗
 
[6-7] 
𝜕〈𝑎𝑖2〉〈〈𝑣𝑖2〉〉𝑎𝑖
𝜕𝑧

3 (
〈𝑎𝑖2〉
〈𝛼2〉) {−
〈𝛼2〉〈〈𝑣𝑔2〉〉
𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝜌𝑔
𝜕𝑧} + ∑〈𝜙𝑗,2〉
𝑗
 
[6-8] 
It is noted that the covariance terms that arise from area-averaging the intragroup 
expansion/contraction source/sink terms in the two-group interfacial area transport equations have 
been neglected. Furthermore, the complicated covariance terms that would result from area-

250 
 
averaging the source/sink terms will be neglected. As such, the source/sink terms will be 
evaluated in terms of area-averaged two-phase flow parameters. 
 
In order to solve the interfacial area transport equations, constitutive relations are 
required for the velocities 〈〈𝑣𝑖1〉〉𝑎𝑖 and 〈〈𝑣𝑖2〉〉𝑎𝑖. In view of obtaining a useable model, it is 
assumed that these velocities can be approximated by the void-weighted bubble velocities for 
each group such that: 
〈〈𝑣𝑖1〉〉𝑎𝑖≈〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉 
[6-9] 
〈〈𝑣𝑖2〉〉𝑎𝑖≈〈〈𝑣𝑔2〉〉 
[6-10] 
 
To solve the group continuity and interfacial area transport equations, the pressure and 
group velocities are required. In the context of the two-fluid model, these would be obtained 
through a coupled solution of the group continuity and interfacial area transport equations with 
the group momentum and energy equations. However, this introduces many complexities due to 
the interdependence of the constitutive models in the field equations, such as the interfacial drag 
for each group. Therefore, the current approach is to decouple the continuity and interfacial area 
transport equations from the momentum and energy equations to isolate them from the 
uncertainties in other constitutive models. Thus, the experimental measurements of pressure, 
〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉, and 〈〈𝑣𝑔2〉〉 are linearly interpolated between the measurement locations to obtain their 
values throughout the computational domain to be used in the solution of the group continuity 
and interfacial area transport equations. This approach is consistent with previous works on the 
two-group interfacial area transport equation (Fu, 2001; Sun 2001). Future work should 
investigate the performance of the newly developed interfacial area transport model in a full two-
fluid model solution.

6.1.2 Summary of Source/Sink Term Models 
 
This the newly developed interfacial area concentration and void fraction source/sink 
term models for group-I to group-II transition flows are summarized in this Section. For 
simplicity of presentation, the area-average operators are dropped throughout this Section. All 
variables should be regarded as one-dimensional parameters.

6.1.4 Computational Scheme 
A simple finite difference scheme is used to solve the group continuity equations for the 
group void fractions and the group interfacial area transport equations for the group interfacial 
area concentrations, respectively. The group continuity equations are discretized to solve for the 
group void fractions as: 
〈𝛼1〉𝑖+1 =
(〈𝛼1〉𝜌𝑔〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉)𝑖+ 〈𝑚1〉𝑖Δ𝑧
(𝜌𝑔〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉)𝑖+1
  
[6-51] 
〈𝛼2〉𝑖+1 =
(〈𝛼2〉𝜌𝑔〈〈𝑣𝑔2〉〉)𝑖+ 〈𝑚2〉𝑖Δ𝑧
(𝜌𝑔〈〈𝑣𝑔2〉〉)𝑖+1
  
[6-52] 
Likewise, the group interfacial area transport equations are discretized to solve for the group 
interfacial area concentrations as: 
〈𝑎𝑖1〉𝑖+1 =
1
〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉𝑖+1
{(〈𝑎𝑖1〉〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉)𝑖+ Δ𝑧[〈𝜙𝑒𝑥𝑝,1

[6-54] 
where the discretized intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink terms are given as:

Assuming that the flow is isothermal, the gas density along the test section is specified as 
a function of the absolute pressure ((𝑝)𝑖) as: 
(𝜌𝑔)𝑖= 𝜌𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚
(𝑝)𝑖
𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚
 
[6-57] 
where 𝜌𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚 as the density of the gas-phase at atmospheric pressure. The liquid density is 
assumed to remain constant along the flow. Thus, the void-weighted liquid velocity is calculated 
as a function of axial position from the liquid superficial velocity, which is specified as a constant 
inlet condition, and the void fraction along the test section as:  
〈〈𝑣𝑓〉〉𝑖=
〈𝑗𝑓〉
1 −〈𝛼〉𝑖
 
[6-58] 
The built-in function interp1 in MATLAB is used to linearly interpolate the measured 
values pressure, 〈〈𝑣𝑔1〉〉, and 〈〈𝑣𝑔2〉〉 along the computational domain of the test section. If the 
measured group-II bubble velocity is zero, the group-II velocity in the simulation is set equal to 
the group-I velocity to prevent dividing by zero in the solution of the equations. This is a 

259 
 
reasonable treatment if one assumes that group-II bubbles at the initiation of transition behave 
similar to the larger distorted group-I bubbles. A schematic of the computational scheme used to 
solve the two-group continuity and interfacial area transport equations in MATLAB is shown in 
Figure 6-1. The commented source code of the MATLAB implementation is provided in 
Appendix E.

6.1.5 Model Constants and Coefficients 
A systematic procedure is followed to determine the empirical coefficients in the newly 
developed two-group interfacial area transport model. First, the existing model coefficients for 
the one-group bubble interactions mechanisms for vertical-upward flows in round pipes are used 
(Ishii et al., 2002). These coefficients have been determined based on a substantial set of 
experimental data, so there is high confidence in their values. With the one-group coefficients 
specified in the model, 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(11,2) is determined first using Runs 1, 2, 3, and 7 by focusing on the 
group void fraction predictions. While determining 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(11,2), 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(12,2), 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(2), and 𝐶𝑆𝑂  are set to zero 
in order to isolate the wake-entrainment (11,2) source/sink terms. Also, 𝐷𝑆𝑚1,𝑡𝑟
∗
 is fixed at 0.4, 
which is based on the maximum 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 observed in the transition experiments. Additionally, the 
relaxation parameter 𝑎 in the transition function is fixed at 0.01, and 𝛽 is fixed at 0.5. 
Runs 2, 3, and 7 were selected to determine 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(11,2) because they have the lowest 
contributions of group-II void fraction and demonstrate growth along the test section. It is noted 
that although the group-II void fraction in Run 2 can be considered insignificant (i.e. 
〈𝛼2〉<0.005), it does demonstrate growth along the test section. Moreover, it is found that the 
small amount of group-II void fraction in this condition is repeatable in the experiments. 
Additionally, the increasing trend in the group-II void in this condition cannot be predicted 
without a void source term; the expansion due to the pressure drop alone is not enough to match 
the increase that is observed. Therefore, this condition is considered useful in determining 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(11,2).
 
The current model for 𝑅𝑊𝐸
(11,2) will always produce some amount of group-II due to the 
nature of the transition function. This is acceptable provided that the group-II that is produced 
remains a minimal contribution in one-group flows. Therefore, Run 1, a one-group condition near 

261 
 
the initiation of transition, is used to ensure that the group-II void fraction that is produced in that 
condition while adjusting 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(11,2) does not exceed 5% of the total void fraction.  
After setting 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(11,2),   𝐶𝑊𝐸
(12,2) is set using Runs 7 and 8. Run 8 demonstrates the most 
significant transfer from group-I to group-II, which is a clear signature of intergroup wake-
entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles. Run 7 also demonstrates significant growth 
that was not able to be captured with wake-entrainment (11,2) alone while maintaining acceptable 
predictions in the other low group-II contribution conditions.  
After setting the intergroup wake-entrainment coefficients, a first estimate of 𝐶𝑆𝑂 was 
obtained using the highest gas flow rate conditions, Runs 6 and 9, which demonstrate clear 
growth in the interfacial area concentration as well as transfer of void from group-II to group-I. In 
determining this first estimate of 𝐶𝑆𝑂, 𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟2 was set to zero so that the shearing-off mechanism 
would not be limited in these highest gas flow rate conditions. With this first estimate of 𝐶𝑆𝑂, the 
interfacial area concentration predictions in Runs 4, 5, and 8 were used to determine 𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟2. 
Some iteration was required on the value of 𝐶𝑆𝑂 to obtain the best fit with the data after 
introducing 𝑊𝑒𝑐𝑟2. The coefficients 𝛾𝑆𝑂 and 𝛽𝑆𝑂 in the shearing-off model are unchanged from 
Fu’s (2001) study. Lastly, 𝐶𝑊𝐸
(2) was determined using Runs 6 and 9 again since they demonstrate 
clear decreasing trends in the group-II interfacial area concentration along the test section.  
Table 6-1 summarizes the model constants and coefficients in the present two-group 
interfacial area transport model. Here, model constants refer to numerical parameters with values 
that are fixed based on modeling arguments. Model coefficients are adjustable parameters that are 
systematically determined through experiment.

6.2 Model Evaluation Results and Discussion 
This Section discusses results from the evaluation of the newly developed two-group 
interfacial area transport equation against the one-group to two-group transition test conditions. 
The complete set of results including the individual source/sink term contributions to the group-I 
and group-II void fractions and interfacial area concentrations is included in Appendix F. 
First, consider the predictions of void fraction and interfacial area concentration for Run 
1, the one-group flow condition, shown in Figure 6-2. The void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration are both predicted well within ±10%. This confirms that the present two-group 
model will function well in one-group flow conditions. It is noted that a small amount of group-II 
void fraction and interfacial area concentration are generated by the intergroup wake-entrainment 
(11,2) mechanism. However, the error this introduces into the overall prediction is negligible.

area concentrations for Run 1 (〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 2.00 m/s and 〈𝑗𝑔〉18𝐷 = 0.18 m/s). 

264 
 
 
The prediction results for Runs 7 and 8 clearly demonstrate the efficacy of the current 
model in predicting the void fraction and interfacial area concentration in one-group to two-group 
transition conditions. Figure 6-3 shows the predictions of void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration for Run 7. Both the group-I and group-II void fractions are predicted very well 
along the length of the test section. The model is capable of predicting the increase in group-II 
void fraction and the corresponding decrease in group-I void fraction, indicating that the 
intergroup coalescence source/sink terms are active in the solution. The total and group-I 
interfacial area concentrations are somewhat under predicted towards the end of the test section in 
Run 7. However, the predictions are still within ±10% of the experimental data. Most 
importantly, the model captures the overall decreasing trend in the interfacial area concentration 
in this transition condition. Although the contribution of the group-II interfacial area 
concentration to the total interfacial area concentration is negligible in this case, it is important to 
note that the model does capture the increase in the group-II interface area concentration along 
the test section. This indicates that the model is exchanging void and interfacial area 
concentration correctly between the groups.  
 
To obtain a better sense of how the model is functioning, Figure 6-4 shows the individual 
source/sink term contributions to the changes in the group-I and group-II interfacial area 
concentrations along the test section for Run 7. A detailed explanation of the legends in the 
source/sink term contribution plots is provided in Appendix F. In vertical-upward adiabatic flows, 
the expansion/contraction source/sink terms (EXP1 and EXP2) are always sources to the group 
interfacial area concentrations. For Run 7, EXP1 is the only source to the group-I interfacial area 
concentration as shown in Figure 6-4(a). Both intergroup wake-entrainment (11,2) and (12,2) are 
significant sinks to the group-I interfacial area concentration in this condition. As the flow 
develops and the group-II void fraction increases, the intergroup wake-entrainment (12,2) 
mechanism becomes more important. The random collision sink term RC1(11,1) is also very 

265 
 
active in this condition. This may be why the interfacial area concentration is somewhat under 
predicted in this condition. Notice that the modification to the shearing-off source term keeps the 
shearing-off mechanism inactive in this cap-bubbly flow condition. 
 
Considering the contributions to the change in the group-II interfacial area concentration 
in Figure 6-4(b), the intergroup wake-entrainment (11,2) and (12,2) mechanisms are the dominant 
sources of group-II interfacial area concentration. Interestingly, the intergroup wake-entrainment 
(11,2) is a more significant source to the group-II interfacial area concentration for this condition. 
Towards the end of the test section, it is observed that the intragroup wake entrainment sink to 
group-II is starting to become more active. 
 
Figure 6-5 shows the void fraction and interfacial area concentration predictions for Run 
8. Similar to Run 7, the model is capable of predicting the exchange between the group void 
fractions along the pipe. Observe that the interfacial area concentration prediction has a non-
linear trend. This is consistent with the experimental data. The change in the total and group-I 
interfacial area concentration measurements per unit length between L=18D and L=34.5D is 
greater than that between L=34.5D and L=63D. Considering the contributions from the individual 
source/sink terms shown in Figure 6-6, it is observed that the shearing-off mechanism becomes 
active along the pipe in this condition. Correspondingly, the importance of the one-group 
source/sink terms begins to diminish, which can be seen clearly for the random collision sink 
term in Figure 6-6(a). Wake entrainment (12,2) is the major sink to the group-I interfacial area 
concentration in this condition, which is consistent with the significant exchange in the group 
void fractions that is occurring. 
 
In Figure 6-6(b) the intergroup wake-entrainment (12,2) mechanism is now more 
dominant than the intergroup wake-entrainment (11,2) mechanism. This is likely due to the 
increased group-II bubble size in this higher void fraction condition. Also, observe that intragroup 
wake entrainment (22,2) is now a significant sink to the group-II interfacial area concentration, 
which is important since it corresponds to a reduction in group-II number.

270 
 
Predictions of the void fraction and interfacial area concentration for Run 9 are shown in 
Figure 6-7. Now the flow is clearly transitioning into an established two-group flow structure 
since the interfacial area concentration is increasing along the test section, which is attributed to 
the shearing-off mechanism. Considering the individual source/sink term contributions for Run 9 
in Figure 6-8, the shearing-off source term is active throughout the pipe in this condition. The 
one-group source/sink terms have diminished significantly, and shearing-off and wake-
entrainment (12,2) are the dominant mechanisms. Intragroup wake-entrainment also continues to 
be a significant sink to the group-II interfacial area concentration. 
Figure 6-9 shows the absolute relative errors between the predictions and the 
experimental data for each run at Port2 (L=34.5D) and Port3 (L=63D). Overall, the average 
absolute relative errors for the  total interfacial area concentration and void fraction predictions 
are ±4% and ±3%, respectively. The maximum absolute relative errors for the total interfacial 
area concentration and void fraction are ±8% and ±9%. For the group-I interfacial area 
concentration and void fraction predictions, the average absolute relative errors are ±4% and 
±6%, and the maximum absolute relative errors are ±10% and ±24%. The largest errors in the 
group-I void fraction predictions occur for Runs 5 and 6, which are developing into more 
established two-group flows. This may suggest that the shearing-off mechanism in these 
conditions is not producing enough group-I void fraction. The balance between the shearing-off 
mechanism and intergroup wake entrainment (12,2) as more established two-group flows develop 
should be investigated further in future work. In Run 2, the experimental group-II void fraction 
and interfacial area concentration values are small. Therefore, the relative errors for the 
predictions of these parameters for Run 2 are magnified. Similarly for Run 1, small amounts of 
group-II void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted for this one-group 
condition, yielding very large relative errors. However, these errors are misleading in view of the 
relative magnitude of group-II void and interfacial area concentration to the total void and 

271 
 
interfacial area concentration. Excluding Runs 1 and 2, the average absolute relative errors for the 
group-II void fraction and interfacial concentration predictions are ±9% and ±11%, respectively. 
Likewise, the maximum absolute relative errors are ±21% and ±29%. Again, considering that the 
largest errors for the group-II void fraction and interfacial area concentration occur for relatively 
small quantities, these results are actually very encouraging.

6.3 Chapter Summary 
 
In this Chapter the two-group interfacial area transport model for one-group to two-group 
transition flows that was developed in Chapter 5 was evaluated against the nine one-group to two-
group transition test conditions. A program was developed in MATLAB to solve the steady-state, 
one-dimensional, adiabatic two-group continuity and interfacial area transport equations for the 
group void fractions and interfacial area concentrations. The major findings of the evaluation can 
be summarized as: 
 
 
The model has the capability to produce group-II void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration from one-group flows.  
 
 
The model accurately captures the exchange between the group void fractions and 
interfacial area concentrations in one-group to two-group transition conditions. 
 
 
The shearing-off mechanism dynamically activates as established two-group flows 
develop.  
 
 
The importance of the one-group source/sink terms diminishes as established two-group 
flows develop.    
 
 
The group-I void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted with average 
absolute relative errors of ±6% and ±4%, respectively. 
 
 
The group-II void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted with average 
absolute relative errors of ±9% and ±11%, respectively. 
 
 
The total void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted with average 
absolute relative errors of ±3% and ±4%, respectively.

Summary and Recommendations for Future Work 
7.1 Summary of Current Work 
 
After review of the available literature on the development of the interfacial area 
transport equation, it was identified that no systematic study has been performed on the transition 
from one-group to two-group flows. The ability to transition from one-group to two-group flows 
is required to fully realize the benefit of the two-group interfacial area transport equation as a 
dynamic closure model for the interfacial area concentration in the two-fluid model. Therefore, 
the primary objective and unique contribution of this work is to develop models that can achieve 
a dynamic transition from one-group to two-group flow conditions. With this major goal in mind, 
this dissertation sought to address this issue through theoretical and experimental investigations. 
In view of the previous Chapters, the major accomplishments of this dissertation are summarized 
as follows: 
 
Derived new expansion source terms, improving the basic formulation of the interfacial area 
transport equation  
 
To clearly establish the interfacial area transport equation framework applicable to 
bubbly, cap-bubbly, slug, and churn-turbulent flows, a detailed derivation of both the one-group 
and two-group interfacial area transport equations was established. The major contributions of 
this effort are: 

277 
 
 
A new approach that appealed directly to the necessary agreement between the void 
transport equation(s) and continuity equation(s) in the two-fluid model was used to 
develop constitutive models for the unknown terms in the void transport equation(s). In 
particular, models for the rate of change of particle volume (𝑉̇ ) were developed and used 
to complete the one-group and two-group interfacial area transport equations. 
 
 
It was found that the existing expansion/contraction source/sink terms in the two-group 
interfacial area transport equation incorrectly include the effects of intergroup transfer. 
This effectively leads to double counting the effects of intergroup particle interactions 
and expansion/contraction across the group boundary on the group interfacial area 
concentrations. Revised models for these terms were developed to correct this issue. This 
is a significant contribution to the field of interfacial area transport.  
 
 
A shape factor (𝛾2) was introduced to properly account for the effect of different group-II 
bubble shapes in the intragroup expansion/contraction source/sink term in the group-II 
interfacial area transport equation. 
 
 
Consistency requirements among the source/sink terms in the interfacial area transport 
equations were identified and discussed to provide guidelines for model development.  
  
 
Recommendations were made on the appropriate forms of the interfacial area transport 
equation(s) for consistent implementation with the two-fluid model. 
 

278 
 
Improved the local conductivity probe measurement technique through systematic investigation  
 
 
 
Reliable experimental data is essential to two-phase flow model development. Therefore, 
the effects of several practical aspects of a conductivity probe measurement system on the 
measured two-phase flow parameters were investigated to provide guidelines for conductivity 
probe data acquisition. These investigations are summarized as:  
 
 
Signal ghosting, an electrical interface inherent to multiplexing DAQs, causes artificially 
high bubble velocity measurements and low interfacial area concentration measurements 
that depend on sampling frequency and sensor impedance. A revised electrical circuit that 
incorporates a voltage follower to reduce the source impedances of the conductivity 
probe sensors was suggested to eliminate this artificial variability. The characteristics of 
signal ghosting and the performance of the revised circuit were investigated 
experimentally with a novel dual double-sensor conductivity probe.  
 
 
Sensitivity of the measured two-phase flow parameters to data acquisition sampling 
frequency was investigated in 13 vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow conditions 
spanning the bubbly and slug flow regimes. Measurements acquired with a sampling 
frequency of 250kHz were downsampled to subsequently lower sampling frequencies to 
isolate the effect of sampling frequency. The measured void fraction and bubble velocity 
were found to be relatively insensitive to sampling frequency. However, for a given 
liquid flow rate, it was observed that with increasing gas flow rate, higher sampling 
frequencies are required to obtain bubble number frequency and interfacial area 
concentration measurements that are within ±5% of the 250kHz measurements. This 
trend is due to both the increase in gas velocity and the transition to the slug flow regime 
with increasing gas flow rate. The highest combination of gas and liquid flow rates 

279 
 
studied indicates that sampling frequencies greater than 100kHz may be required to 
adequately capture all of the measured two-phase flow parameters.  
 
 
The effect of measurement duration was investigated with the same set of conductivity 
probe measurements used in the sampling frequency sensitivity study by processing 
successively shorter durations of the full 60s signals. The measurements for both group-I 
and group-II bubbles were observed to be insensitive to the measurement duration and 
the number of bubbles, as long as the measurements are made for a duration long enough 
to capture a collection of samples characteristic to a given two-phase flow system.  
 
 
It is recommended that sensitivity studies on sampling frequency and measurement 
duration be implemented as part of data quality control practices to identify the 
appropriate sampling frequency and measurement duration for the flow conditions of 
interest. 
 
 
In regards to probe sensor orientation, it was found that orienting a double-sensor probe 
perpendicular to the duct wall leads to a significantly asymmetric measured bubble 
velocity profile across the pipe diameter, especially for group-II bubbles. However, if the 
double-sensor probe is oriented parallel to the duct wall, a symmetric profile is observed. 
Therefore, when fabricating a conductivity probe, it is recommended that the double 
sensor probe used for bubble velocity measurements be oriented such that it will be 
parallel to the pipe wall. 
 

280 
 
Established reliable experimental database of local two-phase flow parameters and 
characterized the transition from one-group to two-group flows 
 
 
Experiments were performed in nine vertical-upward air-water two-phase flow conditions 
in a 5.08cm inner diameter pipe at 〈𝑗𝑓〉 = 1.00m/s and 2.00m/s with increasing gas flow rates in 
the transition region between the conventional bubbly and slug flow regimes to establish a 
reliable experimental database highlighting transition from one-group to two-group flows.  In 
each flow condition, the state-of-the-art four-sensor conductivity probe was used to acquire 
measurements of local time-averaged two-phase flow parameters, including the void fraction and 
interfacial area concentration, for group-I and group-II bubbles at three axial locations along the 
test section. Signatures of the transition from one-group to two-group flows are identified as: 
 
 
The change in the local void fraction distribution from wall-peaked to center-peaked is a 
characteristic feature of the group transition. As group-I bubbles coalesce and increase in 
size, they migrate towards the center of the duct, causing this change in distribution. 
  
 
The shapes of the local void fraction and interfacial area concentration distributions 
deviate as the transition progresses since the larger bubbles that are responsible for the 
developing center-peaked void fraction profile contribute less interfacial area 
concentration.  
 
 
A key signature of the group transition is the development of a center-peaked 𝐷𝑆𝑚1 
profile. A maximum value during transition of approximately 4mm was identified for the 
air-water flows investigated. 
  

281 
 
 
The axial development of the area-averaged void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration indicates active coalescence in these flow conditions that leads to transfer 
between the groups as the flow develops along the pipe. 
 
 
The total and group-I interfacial area concentrations begin to increase along the pipe in 
more established two-group flows, which suggests that the shearing-off mechanism 
becomes active as the transition progresses. 
 
Assessed TRACE-T against newly established experimental database of one-group to two-
group transition flows 
 
 
The newly established experimental database that highlights one-group to two-group 
transition was used to assess the available two-group interfacial area transport model for 
moderate diameter pipes (Fu 2001; Fu and Ishii, 2002a) in TRACE-T (Bernard, 2014). 
Predictions of the experimental data were made using the system analysis code TRACE-T 
(Bernard, 2014) with Fu’s (2001) two-group interfacial area transport source/sink term models. 
Major observations from the assessment include: 
 
 
The intergroup coalescence mechanisms between group-I bubbles that are responsible for 
generating group-II interfacial area concentration and void fraction from group-I were not 
active in the predictions of the one-group to two-group transition conditions. 
 
 
Intergroup wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles was effectively 
inactive in the predictions. Physically, this is a major mechanism during the transition 
process from one-group to two-group flows.  
 

282 
 
 
The shearing-off mechanism was an active source of group-I interfacial area 
concentration in conditions with low contribution of group-II bubbles. This is unphysical, 
since the cap-bubbly flows at the beginning of transition from one-group to two-group 
flows do not contain group-II bubbles of sufficient size for shearing-off to occur. 
 
Developed interfacial area transport models for dynamic transition from one-group to two-
group flows 
 
The necessary bubble interaction source/sink term models to achieve dynamic transition 
from one-group to two-group flows with the two-group interfacial area transport equation were 
developed. The framework of one-group to two-group transition flows was established. The 
increasing importance of wake-dominant bubble transport was identified as the characteristic of 
the initiation of transition. As the transition progresses towards a more established two-group 
flow structure the interfacial area concentration increases due to increasing activity of the 
shearing-off mechanism. In an established two-group flow, shearing-off and wake entrainment 
become the major source and sink, respectively, to the interfacial area concentration. With this 
framework in mind, the following efforts were made to establish the required models for a two-
group interfacial area transport model applicable to one-group to two-group transition flows: 
 
 
A general wake entrainment interaction rate model was established to serve as the basis 
for developing the required source/sink terms for one-group to two-group transition 
flows. 
 
 
Intergroup wake-entrainment of group-I bubbles to form group-II bubbles was considered 
as an evolutionary process to develop the necessary interfacial area concentration and 

283 
 
void fraction source/sink terms to achieve dynamic transition from one-group to two-
group flows. 
 
 
Interfacial area concentration and void fraction source/sink terms for intergroup wake 
entrainment of group-I bubbles into group-II bubbles were developed. This is a major 
mechanism that drives the one-group to two-group transition and becomes the major sink 
to the interfacial area concentration in established two-group flows. 
 
 
A model for the interfacial area concentration sink term due to intragroup coalescence of 
group-II bubbles was developed. 
 
 
The available shearing-off model (Fu, 2001) was modified to include a function of the 
group-II bubble Weber number so that it would become active as an established two-
group flow structure develops. This treatment prevents non-physical shearing-off at the 
initiation of transition. 
 
 
The existing intragroup turbulence impact, random collision, and wake entrainment 
models for group-I bubbles were revised to include a function of the group-II bubble 
Weber number to diminish their importance as an established two-group flow develops. 
This treatment was also included in the newly developed wake-entrainment (11,2) 
source/sink terms. 
 

284 
 
Evaluated newly developed interfacial area transport model for one-group to two-group 
transition flows against experimental data 
 
 
A program was developed in MATLAB to solve the steady-state, one-dimensional, 
adiabatic two-group continuity and interfacial area transport equations for the group void 
fractions and interfacial area concentrations. The newly developed interfacial area transport 
model was implemented and evaluated against the experimental database of one-group to two-
group transition conditions. The major findings of the evaluation can be summarized as: 
 
 
The model has the capability to produce group-II void fraction and interfacial area 
concentration during transition from one-group to two-group flows.  
 
 
 
 
The model accurately captures the exchange between the group void fractions and 
interfacial area concentrations in one-group to two-group transition conditions. 
 
 
 
The shearing-off mechanism dynamically activates as established two-group flows 
develop.  
 
 
The importance of the one-group source/sink terms diminishes as established two-group 
flows develop. 
 
 
The group-I void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted with average 
absolute relative errors of ±6% and ±4%, respectively. 
 
 
The group-II void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted with average 
absolute relative errors of ±9% and ±11%, respectively. 
 

285 
 
 
The total void fraction and interfacial area concentration are predicted with average 
absolute relative errors of ±3% and ±4%, respectively. 
 
 
These accomplishments are necessary advancements to the state-of-the-art in interfacial 
area transport modeling. However, new topics for study are always identified and are an 
important result of the research process. As such, recommendations for future work are provided 
in Section 7.2 
7.2 Recommendations for Future Work 
In view of the current dissertation, the following recommendations are made for future 
studies to continue the efforts on developing the two-group interfacial area transport equation as a 
constitutive model for the interfacial area concentration in the two-fluid model: 
 
Experimental Studies: 
 
 
Perform experiments in vertical-upward one-group to two-group transition test conditions 
with longer flow development length and more axial measurement locations to establish 
additional experimental database to support continued model validation. 
 
 
Establish additional experimental database in vertical-upward one-group to two-group 
transition two-phase flows in different size channels to assess the scalability of the 
transition model. 
 
 
Investigate the transition from one-group to two-group flows in other two-phase flow 
configurations such as horizontal and vertical-downward two-phase flows. 

286 
 
 
Perform experiments to investigate the transition from an established two-group flow to a 
purely one-group flow. A revised two-phase flow injector that injects large as opposed to 
small bubbles is one way to achieve this. 
 
 
Establish experimental database highlighting the transition from a dispersed-gas two-
group flow to annular two-phase flow. 
 
Model Development: 
 
 
Refine the characterization of one-group to two-group transition phenomena. The present 
dissertation focused on the group-I Sauter-mean diameter as a transition signature. Other 
signatures such as the change in the transverse void fraction profile from wall-peaked to 
center-peaked should be investigated to establish complementary transition criteria to the 
Sauter-mean diameter. 
 
 
Assess the effect of different group-II bubble shapes in the interfacial area transport 
equation and develop a framework, if necessary, to evolve from one shape to another. 
 
 
Develop two-group interfacial area transport models for other two-phase flow 
configurations such as horizontal two-phase flows and vertical-downward two-phase 
flows. 
 
 
Perform an assessment on the importance of different two-phase flow configurations in 
practical applications to guide modeling efforts. 
 
 
Develop a framework and the necessary constitutive relations for the transition from 
established two-group flow to annular two-phase flow. 

287 
 
Computational Investigation: 
 
 
 
Assess the different forms of the expansion/contraction source/sink terms developed in 
this dissertation to determine which is more desirable for numerical implementation. 
 
 
Implement the newly developed interfacial area transport model for one-group to two-
group transitional flows into TRACE-T and assess its performance against available 
experimental database. 
 
 
 
Investigate the performance of the interfacial area transport equation in multi-
dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations of one-group to two-group 
transition flows. 
 
The two-group interfacial area transport equation as a closure model for the interfacial 
area concentration in the two-fluid model can provide the capability to account for the dynamic 
evolution of the interfacial area concentration. This is required in order to properly account for 
changes in the interfacial structure in modeling two-phase flows. This dissertation addressed the 
essential issue of the transition from one-group to two-group flows. Fundamental improvements 
were made to the interfacial area transport equation through derivation of new expansion source 
terms that properly account for intergroup bubble transport. This major effort provides a solid 
foundation for future work in interfacial area transport model development and implementation 
with the two-fluid model. The systematic investigations into practical aspects of the conductivity 
probe measurement system provided guidelines that can be used in future experimental studies 
for enhanced conductivity probe data acquisition. Furthermore, a needed experimental database 
of local conductivity probe measurements of key two-phase flow parameters was established in 
one-group to two-group transition two-phase flows. With the database, characteristic signatures 

288 
 
of one-group to two-group transition were identified. This database and the signatures that were 
identified provide a basis for continuing the experimental efforts on transitional flows. Lastly, 
interfacial area transport models that provide the necessary capability to dynamically transition 
from one-group to two-group flows were developed. The recommendations for future work 
outlined in this section provide the necessary direction to continue development of the interfacial 
area transport equation.

Appendix A 
 
Data Reduction Methods 
This Appendix outlines the data reduction methods used to calculate various two-phase 
flow quantities obtained during the experiments in the vertical-upward test section. 
A.1 Superficial Gas Velocity  
 
Dwyer Series RMB rotameters are used to meter the air flow rate to the test section. The 
air rotameters are factory calibrated to measure the volumetric air flow rate in units of standard 
cubic feet per hour (SCFH) at standard conditions of 70°F and 14.7psia (Dwyer Instruments, Inc., 
2015). If the operating conditions at the exit of the flow meter deviate from the standard 
conditions, the gas flow rate observed at the rotameter must be corrected. The correction is given 
as (Dwyer Instruments, Inc., 2015):  
𝑄2 = 𝑄1√𝑝1
𝑝2
𝑇2
𝑇1
 
[A-1] 
where: 
𝑄1: Actual or observed flow meter reading (SCFH) 
𝑄2: Standard flow corrected for pressure and temperature (SCFH) 
𝑝1: Actual pressure (14.7 psia + Gage Pressure psig) 
𝑝2: Standard pressure (14.7 psia, which is 0 psig) 
𝑇1: Actual temperature (460 R + Temp °F) 
𝑇2: Actual temperature (530 R, which is 70°F) 

299 
 
 
The room where the vertical-upward test section is located is maintained at 70°F. 
Therefore, the temperature effect in the correction is neglected. The actual pressure is determined 
as the sum of the standard pressure and the back pressure (𝑝𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘) that is measured by a dial gauge 
at the exit of the air rotameters. Thus, denoting the gas flow rate observed at the rotameters as 
𝑄𝑔,𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑣 (in SCFH), the equivalent gas flow corrected to the standard pressure condition (𝑄𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚) 
is calculated as:  
𝑄𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚= 𝑄𝑔,𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑣√(𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚+ 𝑝𝑏𝑎𝑐𝑘)
𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚
 
[A-2] 
The subscript “atm” on 𝑄𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚 signifies that this is the equivalent volumetric gas flow rate at the 
atmospheric pressure condition. Since the absolute pressure in the test section is greater than 
atmospheric pressure, the actual gas volumetric flow rate in the test section, which varies with 
axial position as the pressure changes, is less than 𝑄𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚.  
 
 
Conventionally, researchers in the two-phase flow community report the superficial 
velocities (i.e. volumetric fluxes through the cross-section) of the gas and liquid phases rather 
than the volumetric flow rates themselves. Thus, the gas superficial velocity evaluated at the 
atmospheric pressure condition (〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑎𝑡𝑚) can be considered as an intermediate parameter that is 
given by: 
〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑎𝑡𝑚= 𝑄𝑔,𝑎𝑡𝑚
𝐴
 
[A-3] 
where 𝐴 is the cross-sectional flow area of the test section. With the gauge pressure at a given 
axial elevation above the test section inlet (𝑝𝑧), the actual superficial gas velocity at that elevation 
(〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧) can be calculated as: 

300 
 
〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧= 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑎𝑡𝑚
𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚
𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑚+ 𝑝𝑧
 
[A-4] 
Measurement of the gauge pressure is discussed in Section A.2. Multiplying 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 by 𝐴 would 
give the actual gas volumetric flow rate at that elevation (𝑄𝑔,𝑧).  
 
Note that in this discussion, the brackets 〈
〉 are only used to indicate that 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 and 
〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑎𝑡𝑚 represent cross-sectional average quantities. They are not meant to imply that an area-
averaging procedure was performed on local measurements of 𝑗𝑔. 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑧 and 〈𝑗𝑔〉𝑎𝑡𝑚 are “global,” 
as opposed to “local,” two-phase flow parameters since they are based on measurements from the 
air rotameters, dial pressure gauge, and pressure transducer. These are “global” instruments as 
opposed to “local” instruments like the conductivity probe. Another estimate of the superficial 
gas velocity at a given axial elevation can be obtained by area-averaging the product of the local 
void fraction and bubble velocity measurements obtained with the conductivity probe. This 
estimate of the superficial gas velocity is denoted as 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧. For 〈𝛼𝑣𝑔〉𝑧, the brackets do imply 
that an area-average operation was performed on the product of the local 𝛼 and 𝑣𝑔 measurements. 
The method used to area-average the local two-phase flow parameters obtained with the 
conductivity probe is discussed in Section A.4. Comparing these two estimates of the superficial 
gas velocity serves as a method to benchmark the conductivity probe measurements.          
A.2 Gauge Pressure   
A differential pressure transducer is used to obtain pressure measurements at the 
instrumentation ports in the test section. If the low side of the differential pressure transducer is 
left open to the atmosphere, the pressure transducer can be used obtain gauge pressure 
measurements. The elevation of the pressure transducer is located below all of the pressure taps in 

301 
 
the instrumentation ports of the vertical-upward test facility. The pressure transducer is connected 
to a pressure tap in the instrumentation port through an impulse line that is filled with water. 
Thus, the pressure measured by the transducer (𝑝𝑚,𝑧) includes the hydrostatic head from the 
water in the impulse line. Therefore, the gauge pressure at a given axial elevation above the test 
section inlet (𝑝𝑧) is calculated as: 
𝑝𝑧= 𝑝𝑚,𝑧−𝜌𝑓𝑔Δℎ 
[A-5] 
𝜌𝑓, the density of water, and 𝑔, the gravitational acceleration, are taken to be taken to be 998 
kg/m3 and 9.81 m/s2 in calculations. Δℎ is the height difference between the centers of the 
pressure taps in instrumentation ports and the pressure transducer. The heights of the centers of 
pressure taps in the instrumentation ports and the pressure transducer above the floor are provided 
in Table A-1. Atmospheric pressure is taken to be 101.325kPa to calculate absolute pressures 
from the measured gauge pressures; the deviation in local atmospheric pressure from this value is 
not considered.

A.3 Local Two-Phase Flow Parameters   
The state-of-the-art local four-sensor conductivity probe is used in this dissertation to 
acquire measurements of local time averaged two-phase flow parameters. The improved 
conductivity probe signal processing software developed by Bernard (2014) was used in this 
dissertation to process the conductivity probe signals. The conductivity probe signal processing 
software developed by Bernard (2014) was based on the 4pt200 signal processing program that 
was originally developed at Purdue University (Fu and Ishii, 1999; Kim et al., 2000; Fu, 2001). 
The basic operating principle of the conductivity probe was summarized in Chapter 1. The details 
of the conductivity probe signal processing scheme used to calculate the local time-averaged two-
phase flow parameters from the measured conductivity probe voltage signals can be found in the 
references (Fu and Ishii, 1999; Kim et al., 2000; Fu, 2001; Bernard, 2014).  
In the conductivity probe signal processing scheme (Kim et al., 2000), bubbles are 
categorized as either group-I or group-II bubbles according to the chord length that is measured 
when a bubble hits the probe. The boundary between group-I and group-II bubbles is taken to be 
the maximum distorted bubble limit given by Ishii and Zuber (1979), which is approximately 
10mm for air-water flows near ambient pressure. Thus, bubbles with measured chord lengths less 
than 10mm are classified as group-I bubbles, while bubbles with measured chord lengths greater 
than 10mm are classified as group-II bubbles. Additional details about the bubble categorization 
scheme can be found in the references (Kim et al., 2000; Fu, 2001; Bernard, 2014).  
The local two-phase flow parameters that were obtained in the scoping study test 
conditions and the one-group to two-group transition test conditions are presented in Appendices 
B and C, respectively. Table A-2 describes the local time-averaged two-phase flow parameters 
that are presented in those Appendices. The subscripts “1” and “2” indicate group-I and group-II 
parameters, respectively. Parameters without the “1” or “2” subscripts are total parameters.

*𝑁𝑏1 and 𝑁𝑏2 are the number of group-I and group-II bubbles, respectively, detected by sensor 0 of the 
conductivity probe. Likewise, 𝑁𝑏= 𝑁𝑏1 + 𝑁𝑏2 is the total number of bubbles detected. 𝑁𝑏1, 𝑁𝑏2, and 𝑁𝑏 
are the actual output parameters of the conductivity probe signal processing software. 𝑓𝑏1, 𝑓𝑏2, and 𝑓𝑏 are 
calculated as additional parameters in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that is used to organize and study the 
outputted parameters from the conductivity probe signal processing software.         
A.4 Area-Averaged Two-Phase Flow Parameters 
 
The local time-averaged two-phase flow parameters obtained with the conductivity probe 
can provide great insight into the local structure of two-phase flows and are invaluable to the 
development and benchmarking of multi-dimensional models of two-phase flow. However, two-
phase flows are often analyzed in a one-dimensional (i.e. cross-sectional averaged) sense such as 
in nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulic system analysis codes like TRACE and RELAP (TRACE 
v5.0 Theory Manual, 2007; RELAP5-3D Code Manual, 2005). Therefore, the local two-phase 

304 
 
flow parameters obtained with the conductivity probe are area-averaged over the flow cross-
section to obtain area-averaged two-phase flow parameters suitable for one-dimensional analysis. 
 
The area-average of a general local quantity 𝜉(𝒙, 𝑡) is defined as: 
〈𝜉〉= 〈𝜉〉(𝑧, 𝑡) = 1
𝐴∫𝜉(𝒙, 𝑡)𝑑𝐴
𝐴
 
[A-6] 
Since we are interested in area-averaging local time-averaged two-phase flow parameters, the 
dependence on time will be suppressed in the remainder of this discussion. Furthermore, since 
two-phase flows through a round pipe are investigated in this dissertation, consider a cylindrical 
coordinate system with the z-coordinate directed along the axis of the pipe such that 𝜉(𝒙) =
𝜉(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑧). Let 𝑅 be the inner radius of the pipe, and 𝐴 is the cross-sectional area of the pipe 
perpendicular to z-direction. Also, for the purpose of the present discussion, assume that 𝜉 is 
axisymmetric such that 𝜉(𝑟, 𝜃, 𝑧) = 𝜉(𝑟, 𝑧). Thus, the area-average of  𝜉 in the pipe cross-section 
is given by: 
〈𝜉〉(𝑧) =
1
𝜋𝑅2 ∫
∫𝜉(𝑟, 𝑧)𝑟𝑑𝑟𝑑𝜃
𝑅
0
2𝜋
0
= 2
𝑅2 ∫𝜉(𝑟, 𝑧)𝑟𝑑𝑟
𝑅
0
 
[A-7] 
 
Now, define a non-dimensional radial coordinate (𝑟∗) as 𝑟∗= 𝑟/𝑅. 𝑟∗= 0 corresponds 
to 𝑟= 0, the center of the pipe, and 𝑟∗= 1 corresponds to 𝑟= 𝑅, the pipe wall. With this, 
Equation [A-7] can be recast as: 
〈𝜉〉(𝑧) = 2 ∫𝜉(𝑟∗, 𝑧)𝑟∗𝑑𝑟∗
1
0
 
[A-8] 
If the function 𝜉 is known and the integral in Equation [A-8] can be evaluated, 〈𝜉〉 can be 
computed exactly. However, if the integral of 𝜉 cannot be performed analytically or if only 

305 
 
discrete values of 𝜉 are known at specific points in the domain of integration, one must rely on 
numerical integration techniques to evaluate 〈𝜉〉. One such technique is the composite Simpson’s 
rule (Stewart, 2007). Applying the composite Simpson’s rule to Equation [A-8] yields: 
〈𝜉〉(𝑧) ≈2 (Δ𝑟∗
3 ) (𝑟0
∗𝜉0 + 4𝑟1
∗𝜉1 + 2𝑟2
∗𝜉2 + 4𝑟3
∗𝜉3 + 2𝑟4
∗𝜉4 + ⋯+ 4𝑟𝑛−1
∗
𝜉𝑛−1 + 𝑟𝑛∗𝜉𝑛) 
[A-9] 
where 𝑛 is number of subintervals of equal width Δ𝑟∗ that the interval of integration is divided 
into. In Equation [A-9], the notation 𝜉𝑗 indicates that 𝜉(𝑟∗) is evaluated at 𝑟𝑗
∗, which is the jth 
discrete point in the interval of integration. Thus, for integrating from 𝑟∗= 0 to 𝑟∗= 1,  𝑟0
∗𝜉0 is 
the quantity 𝑟∗𝜉(𝑟∗) evaluated at 𝑟∗= 0, the center of the pipe. Likewise, 𝑟𝑛∗𝜉𝑛 is the quantity 
𝑟∗𝜉(𝑟∗) evaluated at 𝑟∗= 1, the pipe wall. 
In the context of area-averaging local conductivity probe measurements, 𝜉𝑗 corresponds 
to the measured value of the local time-averaged two-phase flow parameter of interest obtained 
with the conductivity probe at position 𝑟𝑗
∗ in the pipe cross-section. Figure A-1 shows two meshes 
that were used for numerical integration of the conductivity probe measurements acquired across 
the entire diameter of the pipe. The meshes used for numerical integration are identical to the 
conductivity probe measurement meshes discussed in Chapter 3 except that the points at the pipe 
wall (i.e. 𝑟∗= ±1.0) are shown. It is assumed that the local two-phase flow parameters go to zero 
at the pipe wall. However, these points are still included in the area-averaging scheme for 
completeness. Figure A-1(a) corresponds to the uniform measurement mesh with Δ𝑟∗= 0.1 that 
was used for the conductivity probe measurements in the one-group to two-group transition test 
conditions. In the interest of time during the scoping study experiments, a sparser measurement 
mesh was used. The two-phase flow parameters do not typically have strong gradients near the 
center of the pipe. Therefore Δ𝑟∗= 0.2 was used in this region during the scoping study 
experiments. However, it is important to have a finer resolution of points near the pipe wall to 

306 
 
capture the gradients there to obtain appropriate area-averaged values. Therefore, for |𝑟∗| 
between 0.8 and 1.0 a mesh spacing of Δ𝑟∗= 0.1 was used. This non-uniform mesh is shown in 
Figure A-1(b).

calculate area-averaged two-phase flow parameters. (a) Uniform mesh with Δ𝑟∗= 0.1 across the

wall) and Δ𝑟∗= 0.2 for |𝑟∗| between 0 and 0.8.   
In the following discussion of the area-averaging schemes that were used, 𝑟+𝑗
∗ and 𝑟−𝑗
∗ are 
used as a shorthand notation for positive and negative 𝑟∗ values at opposite discrete points along 
the diameter. For simplicity, the j’s correspond to 𝑟∗ points on a uniform mesh with Δ𝑟∗= 0.1 
when discussing the area-averaging schemes for both meshes shown in Figure A-1. For example, 
𝑟+4
∗ corresponds to 𝑟∗= +0.4, and 𝑟−4
∗  corresponds to 𝑟∗= −0.4 regardless of the mesh that is 
under consideration. Likewise, 𝜉+𝑗 represents 𝜉(𝑟+𝑗
∗), and 𝜉−𝑗 represents 𝜉(𝑟−𝑗
∗). Thus, 𝜉+4 =
𝜉(𝑟+4
∗) = 𝜉(𝑟∗= +0.4), and 𝜉−4 = 𝜉(𝑟−4
∗) = 𝜉(𝑟∗= −0.4). With this notation, the uniform 
mesh would contain all points from 𝑟0

If conductivity probe measurements were performed across the entire diameter, all of the 
measurements were used to compute the area-average. The measurements acquired at 𝑟+𝑗
∗ points 
were assumed to be axisymmetric in the right half of the cross-section, and the measurements 
acquired for the 𝑟−𝑗
∗ points were assumed to be axisymmetric in the left-half of the cross-section. 
If measurements were only acquired at the 𝑟+𝑗
∗ points, those measurements were assumed to be 
axisymmetric throughout the entire cross-section to perform the area-average.  
 
For the uniform mesh with Δ𝑟∗= 0.1 and utilizing measurements across the entire 
diameter, the area-average is calculated using Simpson’s rule as:

In addition to the area-average, the void-weighted area-average is another common 
average in one-dimensional two-phase flow analysis. The void-weighted area-average of a 
general local quantity 𝜓 is defined as:  
〈〈𝜓〉〉=
〈𝛼𝜓〉
〈𝛼〉 
[A-14] 
Likewise, one can weight by the interfacial area concentration instead of the void fraction. The 
interfacial area concentration weighted area-average of 𝜓 is defined as: 
〈〈𝜓〉〉𝑎𝑖=
〈𝑎𝑖𝜓〉
〈𝑎𝑖〉 
[A-15] 

309 
 
The same approaches given in Equations [A-10] through [A-13] can be used to numerically 
evaluate the area-average of the product 𝛼𝜓 or 𝑎𝑖𝜓; the 𝜉𝑗 in Equations [A-10] through [A-13] 
are simply replaced with (𝛼𝜓)𝑗 or (𝑎𝑖𝜓)𝑗.   
 
Table A-3 provides descriptions of the area-averaged two-phase flow parameters that 
were calculated from the local conductivity probe measurements. The area-average two-phase 
flow parameters outlined in Table A-3 are presented in Appendices B and C for the scoping study 
test conditions and the one-group to two-group transition test conditions, respectively.

B.2 Gauge Pressures and Superficial Gas Velocities 
This Section provides the gauge pressures and superficial gas velocities at each axial 
location for the scoping study test conditions, Runs S1-S27. The pressure taps in the 
instrumentation ports are located 0.625D (3.18cm or 1.25in.) below the centers of the ports in the 
vertical-upward test section. Therefore, non-dimensional lengths (L/D) from the two-phase flow 
inlet to both the port centers and pressure taps are included in Tables B-2 through B-5.

B.3 Local Two-Phase Flow Parameters 
 
This Section contains the local two-phase flow parameters obtained with the four-sensor 
conductivity probe during the scoping study test conditions, Runs S1-S27. Descriptions of the 
local two-phase flow parameters that are presented are given in Table A-2. Two conductivity 
probes, denoted as Probe A and Probe B, were used during the scoping study measurements. The 
sensor configurations for each probe are provided in Table B-6. At each radial position in the pipe 
cross-section, conductivity probe measurements were acquired with a sampling frequency of 
50kHz for a measurement duration of 60s.

B.4 Area-Averaged Two-Phase Flow Parameters  
 
This Section presents the area-averaged two-phase flow parameters that are calculated 
from the local four-sensor conductivity probe measurements that are presented in Section B.3 for 
the scoping study test conditions, Runs S1-S27. The area-averaged parameters are calculated 
from the local conductivity probe measurements as described in Appendix A. Descriptions of the 
area-averaged two-phase flow parameters that are presented are given in Table A-3.

C.2 Pressure and Superficial Gas Velocity Measurements 
This Section provides the gauge pressures and superficial gas velocities at each axial 
location for the one-group to two-group transition test conditions, Runs 1-9. The pressure taps in 
the instrumentation ports are located 0.625D (3.18cm or 1.25in.) below the centers of the ports in 
the vertical-upward test section. Therefore, non-dimensional lengths (L/D) from the two-phase 
flow inlet to both the port centers and pressure taps are included for reference in Table C-2.

C.3 Local Two-Phase Flow Parameters 
 
This Section presents the local two-phase flow parameters obtained with the four-sensor 
conductivity probe in the one-group to two-group transition test conditions, Runs 1-9. 
Descriptions of the local two-phase flow parameters that are presented are given in Table A-2.  
The same conductivity probe, Probe B described in Table B-6, was used to acquire all of the 
measurements presented in this Section. At each radial position in the pipe cross-section, 
conductivity probe measurements were acquired with a sampling frequency of 50kHz for a 
measurement duration of 60s.

C.4 Area-Averaged Two-Phase Flow Parameters  
 
This Section presents the area-averaged two-phase flow parameters that are calculated 
from the local four-sensor conductivity probe measurements that are presented in Section C.3 for 
the one-group to two-group transition test conditions, Runs 1-9. The area-averaged parameters are 
calculated from the local measurements as described in Appendix A. Descriptions of the area-
averaged two-phase flow parameters that are presented are given in Table A-3.

Appendix D 
 
Shape Factors for Approximate Bubble Shapes 
This Appendix provides a summary of the expressions for some pertinent geometric 
parameters including the shape factors 𝜑 and (𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷)
⁄
 for three approximate bubble shapes: an 
oblate-ellipsoid bubble, a spherical-cap bubble, and an idealized slug bubble. Oblate-ellipsoid 
bubbles were investigated as a more complex approximate group-I bubble shape in comparison to 
a spherical bubble. The geometric parameters for spherical bubbles are straightforward, so they 
are not presently summarized. Recall that the shape factor 𝜑 represents the ratio of actual bubble 
surface area to the surface area of a volume equivalent sphere, and (𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷)
⁄
 is a drag shape 
factor that is proportional to the ratio of the bubble’s projected area to its surface area. 
D.1 Oblate-Ellipsoid Bubble 
 
Figure D-1 shows a schematic of an oblate-ellipsoid bubble. Consider the bubble rising 
vertically upward; the vertical direction is indicated in the figure by the gravity vector. Thus, the 
length of the dimension parallel to the vertical direction is denoted as the vertical diameter (𝐷𝑉), 
and the length of the dimension perpendicular to the vertical direction is denoted as the horizontal 
diameter (𝐷𝐻). 

412 
 
 
 
Figure D-1: Bubble shape approximated as an oblate ellipsoid. 
 
The aspect ratio of an oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝐸𝑜𝑒) can be defined as (Clift et al., 1978; 
Ishii and Mishima, 1980):  
𝐸𝑜𝑒= 𝐷𝑉
𝐷𝐻
 
[D-1] 
With 𝐸𝑜𝑒, the volume of an oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝑉𝑜𝑒) can be expressed as (Zwillinger, 1996): 
𝑉𝑜𝑒= 𝜋
6 𝐷𝑉𝐷𝐻
2 = 𝜋
6 𝐸𝑜𝑒𝐷𝐻
3 = 𝜋
6
𝐷𝑉
3
𝐸𝑜𝑒

[D-2] 
Therefore, the volume equivalent diameter of an oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝐷𝑒,𝑜𝑒) is given as: 
𝐷𝑒,𝑜𝑒= (6𝑉𝑜𝑒
𝜋)
1 3
⁄
= (𝐷𝑉𝐷𝐻
2)1 3
⁄ = 𝐸𝑜𝑒
1/3𝐷𝐻= 𝐷𝑉
𝐸𝑜𝑒
2/3 
[D-3] 
Again utilizing 𝐸𝑜𝑒, the surface area of an oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝐴𝑖,𝑜𝑒) can be expressed as 
(Zwillinger, 1996): 

413 
 
 
𝐴𝑖,𝑜𝑒= 𝜋
2 𝐷𝐻
2 [1 +
𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
2√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ln (1 + √1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
1 −√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 )] 
= 𝜋
2
𝐷𝑉
2
𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 [1 +
𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
2√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ln (1 + √1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
1 −√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 )] 
[D-4] 
Therefore, the surface area equivalent diameter of an oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝐷𝑠,𝑜𝑒) can be given 
as: 
𝐷𝑠,𝑜𝑒= (𝐴𝑖,𝑜𝑒
𝜋)
1 2
⁄
= √2
2 𝐷𝐻[1 +
𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
2√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ln (1 + √1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
1 −√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 )]
1 2
⁄
 
= √2
2
𝐷𝑉
𝐸𝑜𝑒
[1 +
𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
2√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ln (1 + √1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
1 −√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 )]
1 2
⁄
 
[D-5] 
The projected frontal area (i.e. the projected area perpendicular to the assumed vertical-upward 
direction of motion) for the oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝐴𝑝,𝑜𝑒) is given by: 
𝐴𝑝,𝑜𝑒= 𝜋
4 𝐷𝐻
2 = 𝜋
4 (𝐷𝑉
𝐸𝑜𝑒
)
2
 
[D-6] 
Thus, given Equations [D-2] and [D-6], the drag diameter for an oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝐷𝐷,𝑜𝑒) 
can be expressed as: 
𝐷𝐷,𝑜𝑒= 3
2
𝑉𝑜𝑒
𝐴𝑝,𝑜𝑒
= 𝐸𝑜𝑒𝐷𝐻= 𝐷𝑉 
[D-7] 
Likewise, given Equations [D-2] and [D-4], the Sauter-mean diameter for an oblate-ellipsoid 
bubble (𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑜𝑒) can be expressed as: 

414 
 
 
𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑜𝑒= 6𝑉𝑜𝑒
𝐴𝑖,𝑜𝑒
=
2𝐸𝑜𝑒𝐷𝐻
1 +
𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
2√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ln (1 + √1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
1 −√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ) 
 
[D-8] 
 
With Equations [D-3] and [D-8], the shape factor 𝜑𝑜𝑒 for an oblate-ellipsoid bubble can 
be expressed as: 
𝜑𝑜𝑒= 𝐷𝑒,𝑜𝑒
𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑜𝑒
=
2√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 + 𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ln (1 + √1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
1 −√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 )
4(𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 3
⁄ )√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
 
[D-9] 
Additionally, the drag-shape factor for an oblate-ellipsoid bubble (𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑜𝑒𝐷𝐷,𝑜𝑒
⁄
) can be 
evaluated using Equations [D-7] and [D-8] as: 
𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑜𝑒
𝐷𝐷,𝑜𝑒
=
4√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
2√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 + 𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 ln (1 + √1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2
1 −√1 −𝐸𝑜𝑒
2 )
 
[D-10] 
Ishii and Mishima (1980) obtained similar expressions for these shape factors. Using the 
correlation by Wellek et al. (1966) for 𝐸𝑜𝑒, Ishii and Mishima (1980) showed that 𝜑𝑜𝑒 varies 
within about 10% of unity for 𝐸𝑜𝑒 varying between 0.5 and 1.0. With Wellek et al.’s (1966) 
correlation, 𝐸𝑜𝑒= 0.5 corresponds to a volume equivalent diameter of approximately 9mm for 
air-water flows at ambient conditions; 𝐸𝑜𝑒 increases to unity with decreasing bubble size. This 
finding supports the approximation of group-I bubbles as spheres (i.e. 𝜑1 = 𝜑𝑠𝑝ℎ= 1) instead of 
more complicated oblate ellipsoids in specifying 𝐴𝑖1(𝑉) in the interfacial area transport equation. 
However, Ishii and Mishima (1980) also show that the drag shape factor (𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑜𝑒𝐷𝐷,𝑜𝑒
⁄
) varies 
significantly from unity for this range of 𝐸𝑜𝑒. This suggests that additional investigation may be 
required into the modeling of (𝐷𝑆𝑚𝐷𝐷
⁄
)1, which is conventionally assumed to be unity.

D.2 Spherical-Cap Bubble 
A spherical-cap shaped bubble was introduced in Chapter 2 as an approximate shape for 
group-II bubbles in dispersed two-group flows. Figure D-2 shows a schematic of the side-view of 
a spherical-cap bubble. Again, consider a spherical-cap bubble moving vertically upwards. ℎ is 
the height of the spherical-cap bubble, and 2𝑎 is the width of its base. 𝜃 is the spherical-cap 
bubble’s wake-angle. Also, assume that the rear interface of the spherical-cap bubble is flat.

The aspect ratio of a spherical-cap bubble (𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝) can be defined as the ratio of its height 
to its base-width. It can be shown that 𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝 can be expressed as a function of only the wake-angle 
as (Ishii and Mishima, 1980): 
𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝= ℎ
2𝑎= 1 −cos(𝜃)
2 sin(𝜃)     ,   𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝜃≤90° 
[D-11] 
With 𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝, the volume of a spherical-cap bubble (𝑉𝑐𝑎𝑝) can be expressed as (Zwillinger, 1996):

[D-12] 
Therefore, the volume equivalent diameter of a spherical-cap bubble (𝐷𝑒,𝑐𝑎𝑝) can be written as: 
𝐷𝑒,𝑐𝑎𝑝= (6𝑉𝑐𝑎𝑝

The surface area of a spherical-cap bubble (𝐴𝑖,𝑐𝑎𝑝) is taken to be the sum of the curved front 
interface (Zwillinger, 1996) and the flat rear interface and can be expressed as: 
𝐴𝑖,𝑐𝑎𝑝= 2𝜋(1 + 2𝐸𝑐𝑎𝑝
2
)𝑎2 =

Therefore, the surface area equivalent diameter of a spherical-cap bubble (𝐷𝑠,𝑐𝑎𝑝) is given by:

The projected frontal area (i.e. the projected area perpendicular to the assumed vertical-upward 
direction of motion) for the spherical-cap bubble (𝐴𝑝,𝑐𝑎𝑝) is given by: 
𝐴𝑝,𝑐𝑎𝑝= 𝜋𝑎2 
[D-16] 
Thus, given Equations [D-12] and [D-16], the drag diameter for a spherical-cap bubble (𝐷𝐷,𝑐𝑎𝑝) 
can be expressed as:

Similarly, given Equations [D-12] and [D-14], the Sauter-mean diameter (𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑐𝑎𝑝) for a 
spherical-cap bubble can be expressed as: 
𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑐𝑎𝑝= 6𝑉𝑐𝑎𝑝

With Equations [D-13] and [D-18], it can be shown that the shape factor 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝 for a 
spherical-cap bubble can be written as: 
𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝= 𝐷𝑒,𝑐𝑎𝑝
𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑐𝑎𝑝

[D-19] 
Ishii and Mishima (1980) provided a similar expression for 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝 in terms of only the wake angle 
except that the factor of 4 was missing in the denominator of their result. As discussed in Chapter 
2, a constant wake angle of 50° is appropriate for many two-phase flow conditions of interest. For 
a wake angle of 50°, 𝜑𝑐𝑎𝑝≈1.692 . 
 
Using Equations [D-17] and [D-18], the drag shape factor for a spherical-cap bubble 
(𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑐𝑎𝑝𝐷𝐷,𝑐𝑎𝑝

𝐷𝑆𝑚,𝑐𝑎𝑝

D.3 Idealized Slug Bubble 
 
An idealized slug bubble shape was introduced in Chapter 2 as an approximate shape for 
group-II bubbles in confined two-group flows in round pipes. Figure D-3 shows a schematic of 
the side-view of the idealized slug bubble that consists of a cylindrical body with a spherical-cap 
shaped nose. The rear interface at the tail of the slug bubble is assumed to be flat. 𝐷𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔= 𝜆𝐷ℎ is 
the base diameter of the slug bubble (i.e. the diameter of the cylindrical body). The slug bubble 
base diameter is a fraction of the duct hydraulic diameter owing to the liquid film around the slug 
bubble. Thus, the factor 𝜆 represents the ratio of the slug bubble base diameter to the duct 
hydraulic diameter. 𝐿𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔 is the length of the idealized slug bubble.        
 
Figure D-3: Idealized slug bubble shape approximated as having a cylindrical body with a 
spherical-cap shaped nose. 

419 
 
 
The aspect ratio of the idealized slug bubble (𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔) is defined as the ratio of its length to 
base diameter as: 
𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔= 𝐿𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔
𝜆𝐷ℎ
 
[D-21] 
For this assumed slug bubble shape, the nose takes the form of the largest cap bubble that can 
form in the duct. Thus, the base-width of the spherical-cap shaped slug nose (2𝑎𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒) is equal 
to 𝜆𝐷ℎ, and the height of the spherical-cap shaped slug nose (ℎ𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒) is equal to 
𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒𝜆𝐷ℎ. Here, 𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒 is the aspect ratio of the spherical-cap shaped slug nose that is 
defined in a similar manner as for the spherical-cap bubble as:  
𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒= ℎ𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒
2𝑎𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒
= ℎ𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒
𝜆𝐷ℎ
= 1 −cos(𝜃𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒)
2sin (𝜃𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒)  
[D-22] 
The volume of the idealized slug bubble (𝑉𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔) is given by the sum of the volumes of the 
spherical-cap shaped nose and cylindrical body as: 
𝑉𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔= 𝜋

𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒
6
(4𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒
2
−3) + 𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔] 
[D-23] 
Naturally, 𝑉𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔 is a function of the aspect ratio (i.e. the length) of the idealized slug bubble. 
Alternatively, Equation [D-23] can be rearranged to express the idealized slug bubble aspect ratio 
in terms of its volume as:  
𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔= 4𝑉𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔
𝜋(𝜆𝐷ℎ)3 −𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒

The surface area of the idealized slug bubble (𝐴𝑖,𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔) is the sum of the surface areas of the 
spherical-cap shaped nose, the cylindrical body, and the flat rear interface, which can be 
expressed as: 
𝐴𝑖,𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔= 𝜋(𝜆𝐷ℎ)2 [𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒(𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔,𝑛𝑜𝑠𝑒−1) + 𝐸𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔+ 1

With Equation [D-26], the surface area equivalent diameter for the idealized slug bubble (𝐷𝑠,𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔) 
can be given in terms of the slug bubble volume as:

The projected frontal area of the idealized slug bubble (𝐴𝑝,𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔) is given by:

Thus, with Equations [D-23] and [D-28], the drag diameter of the idealized slug bubble (𝐷𝐷,𝑠𝑙𝑢𝑔)

Furthermore, with Equations [D-23] and [D-26], the Sauter-mean diameter of the idealized slug

Appendix F 
 
Evaluation Results for the Interfacial Area Transport Model  
for One-Group to Two-Group Transition Flows  
 
This Appendix contains the evaluation results for the two-group interfacial area transport 
model for one-group to two-group transition flows developed in this dissertation. This includes 
predictions of the total, group-I, and group-II void fractions and interfacial area concentrations for 
the one-group to two-group transition test conditions, Runs 1-9. Also, the individual source/sink 
term contributions to the group-I and group-II void fractions and interfacial area concentrations 
are presented. Table F-1 describes the nomenclature that is used in the legends of the plots 
showing the individual source/sink term contributions.

VITA 
Theodore S. Worosz 
Theodore S. Worosz was born on August 18, 1988. He is the eldest of Stanley and Susan 
Worosz’s three sons. Mr. Worosz grew up in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey where he graduated 
from Pinelands Regional High School in 2006. After completing high school, Mr. Worosz 
attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute where he earned a dual Bachelor of Science in 
Mechanical - Nuclear Engineering in 2010.   
 
Following his time at Rensselaer, Mr. Worosz joined the Advanced Multi-Phase Flow 
Laboratory (AMFL) at the Pennsylvania State University to pursue a Doctor of Philosophy in 
Nuclear Engineering under the supervision of Professor Seungjin Kim. As a graduate research 
assistant at the AMFL, Mr. Worosz engaged in several research projects including: development 
of TRACE with the interfacial area transport equation, conductivity probe development for high 
temperature and pressure applications, investigation into the geometric effects of 90° vertical 
elbows in combined vertical-horizontal two-phase flow, experiments in horizontal two-phase 
flow, and study of two-phase flow through spacer grids.  In 2012, Mr. Worosz obtained a Master 
of Science in Nuclear Engineering, and he continued his major research on two-group interfacial 
area transport in pursuit of the doctoral degree. For the first four years of his graduate studies, Mr. 
Worosz was funded by a United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission Graduate Fellowship. 
During the remainder of his graduate studies, Mr. Worosz was funded by the Rickover Graduate 
Fellowship Program in Nuclear Engineering sponsored by the Naval Reactors Division of the 
United States Department of Energy.   
Mr. Worosz has had the great pleasure of sharing this journey with many special people 
which he cannot thank enough for their support. One person in particular, Miss Tiffany Bennett, 
Esq., has been at his side along the way since they graduated from Pinelands nearly ten years ago. 
“Tiff” and “Ted” will be married in State College, Pennsylvania on November 28, 2015. They are 
excited to begin the next chapter of their lives, especially continuing research on two-phase flows.
