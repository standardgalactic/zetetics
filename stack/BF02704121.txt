Abstract. Metadynamic recrystallization has been investigated in three plain carbon steels (ENIA, EN2 and 
EN24) through the use of hot interrupted compression tests on a wedge plastometer. Holding time was 0⋅⋅5 s 
between passes. Strain rates of 0⋅⋅05 and 0⋅⋅12/s and small strain increments of 3, 5 and 7% were employed. 
Test temperatures were varied between 800 and 1100°C. 
 Various incremental and continuous stress strain curves were highlighted at different temperatures and 
strain rates for 3 steels, ENIA, EN2 and EN24, resulting in varying flow stresses and strains. Highest peak 
stress was 180 MPa for EN24 at peak strain of 0⋅⋅25 and 900°C, with a strain rate 0⋅⋅12/s. Peak strain values for 
all steels at 1100°C was 0⋅⋅133 at a strain rate of 0⋅⋅05/s and 0⋅⋅15 at a strain rate of 0⋅⋅12/s. 
 Strain accumulation resulted in dynamic and metadynamic recrystallization with refinement to about 
15 µµm for dynamic and 22 µµm for metadynamic recrystallization. Fractional softening, X, decreased from 0⋅⋅27 
to 0⋅⋅12 as recrystallization times in metadynamic recrystallization increased from 0⋅⋅9 s to 1⋅⋅5 s at 1100°C. 
Time for 50% metadynamic recrystallization was also reduced as temperature increased. 
 For ENIA, a drop from 10000 s to 20 s, as temperature increased from 800 to 1100°C was observed. For 
EN24 and EN2 steels, a drop from 4000 s to 6 s for similar temperature rise was observed. 
 Metadynamic recrystallization (at strains higher than critical strain) is observed to be a strong function of 
strain rate and a very weak function of temperature and strain. It significantly refined the austenite grain size 
prior to transformation.

1. Introduction 
When hot-rolling is carried out in plate-mills in the 
conventional rolling temperature range, the austenite (γ) 
grains of slabs, coarsened at reheating, are considered 
generally to complete recrystallization during the time 
intervals between the reductions, and to be refined succe-
ssively after every reduction. Although conventional 
rolling operations are finished at 1050–900°C, this 
process continues after a reduction at 850–800°C in 
carbon–manganese or silicon–manganese steels, but stops 
after a reduction at 950–900°C in niobium-containing 
steels—which is about 100°C higher than in niobium-free 
steels. Convergence of grain refinement at the final stage 
of successive reductions is found both when the per-
centage reductions are held constant and when increased. 
γ undergoes work-hardening, dynamic recovery and 
dynamic recrystallization corresponding to the amount of 
the deformation (ε) and the Zener–Hollomon parameter 
(Z) during hot-deformation with a constant strain rate. 
The microstructures produced by these processes are 
unstable. Furthermore, structural changes take place during 
holding at the test temperature, air-cooling from the test 
temperature and sometimes even during quenching after 
deformation. These static restoration processes after 
deformation are: (a) static recovery; (b) abnormal grain 
growth by strain-induced grain boundary migration;  
(c) classical static recrystallization; and (d) metadynamic 
or postdynamic recrystallization (Tamura et al 1988). 
 The observations by Djaic and Jonas (1973) indicate 
that abrupt changes in recrystallization time from strain-
dependence to independence take place at changes in the 
strains a little smaller than εp (εp is the peak strain). The 
similar critical strains over which recrystallized grain 
sizes become independent to applied strain are also obser-
ved. Although these critical strains are, of course, smaller 
than the critical strains for the steady dynamic recrysta-
llization, εs, the recrystallization time and the recrystallized 
grain size are the same as those after straining over εs. 
These abrupt changes correspond to the occurrence of 
metadynamic recrystallization without an incubation time 
and the critical strain may be related to the strain expec-
ted for the start of dynamic recrystallization, εc. It arises 
because pre-existing recrystallization nuclei are present 
in the deformed structure by the onset of dynamic 
recrystallization as well as just after the straining over εs. 
εs is around 0⋅7 εp, and Sellars (1979) reported that the 
critical strain in recrystallization is around 0⋅8 εp and 
those in recrystallized grain size are a little greater than  
0⋅8 εp. Sellars (1979) referred to the strain of the 
intersection over which the size of statically recrysta-
llized grains becomes independent to applied strain, ε*.

Therefore, classical static recrystallization starts from a 
work-hardened and statically recovered structure after 
straining to the range from εcs to εc, and metadynamic 
recrystallization occurs starting from the partly or stea-
dily recrystallized structure by dynamic recrystallization 
after straining over εc or ε*. If there is significant 
difference between εc and ε*, classical static recrystalli-
zation and metadynamic recrystallization occurs side-by-
side after straining to the range from εc to ε*. There is 
another interpretation, viz. that these two types of static 
crystallization occur respectively in the work-hardened 
part and in the dynamically recrystallized part after 
straining to the range from εc to εs. The rate of meta-
dynamic recrystallization is fast and sometimes it com-
pletes during quenching after deformation. It is a kind of 
static recrystallization, although it starts from a dyna-
mically recrystallized structure. The grain structure is 
equiaxed and fairly uniform, has straight grain boun-
daries, and contains annealing twins, similar to the stru-
cture statically recrystallized by the nucleation and 
growth mechanisms but different from the dynamically 
recrystallized structure. The grain size in metadynamic 
recystallization is determined only by Zener–Hollomon 
parameter, Z. It is similar in size to the size of dyna-
mically recrystallized grains, but slightly enlarged com-
pared with it (McQueen and Bergerson 1979). 
 Dynamic, hence metadynamic recrystallization, does 
occur and contributes significantly to grain refinement in 
areas such as early roughing passes during hot rolling or 
in some hot forging extrusion processes. 
 Also in cases where holding times between applied 
strain do not allow for complete static recrystallization, 
total strain accumulation in previous passes is sufficient 
(Hodgson 1997). 
 The present work aims to analyse metadynamic recrysta-
llization kinetics and resultant grain refinement in the 
three plain carbon steels chosen. 
2. Experimental 
ENIA, EN24 and EN2 steels were used as test materials 
in the experimental work. Cylindrical specimens were 
made (diameter 9⋅53 mm, and 19⋅05 mm length). Appro-
priate high temperature lubricant was applied to both 
specimens and platens. These were put inside a container 
and heated to the testing temperature in an argon furnace. 
When the testing temperature was reached, it was allowed 
to soak for 10 min and then the whole assembly was 
transferred to the compression chamber of the wedge 
plastometer. Uniaxial compression tests were performed 
in the plastometer between flat parallel platens and the 
position of a pair of symmetrically disposed wedges. 
Hydraulic valve and timing circuits enabled the move-
ment to be performed in steps with control of speed, 
displacement and time interval between steps. Conti-
nuous measurements of compression and compressive 
force using a load-displacement ultraviolet (UV) recorder 
enabled the stress–strain characteristics to be determined. 
 Strain rates were varied between 0⋅05 and 0⋅12 s– 1 and 
small strain increments of 3, 5 and 7% were applied. Test 
temperatures were varied between 800 and 1250°C for 
different materials. The wedge plastometer can apply 
several strain increments in simple compression with 
holding times adjustable between 0⋅11 and 4⋅6 s. It also 
produced continuous stress strain curves and relaxation 
curves after straining. The stress strain curves provided 
experimental data for peak stress and peak strain values 
and the stress relaxation curves provided data for static, 
t50 and metadynamic, t50 values. 
 Detailed experimental results have been reported else-
where (Morgridge 1990). Relevant results are included 
here for convenience. Composition of steels used is in 
table 1. 
 Standard modelling equations in hot rolling were used 
to obtain calculated values of various metallurgical para-
meters and to compare such values with experimental 
values obtained. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Flow stress 
Flow stress is related to the Zener–Hollomon parameter 
by the equation (Lenard et al 1999) 
 
  Z = ε′ exp(Q/RT) = A [sinh (α σ)]n. 
 
 In figures 1 and 2, the continuous stress–strain curves 
exhibit region of static, dynamic and metadynamic re-
crystallization. Dynamic recrystallization records higher 
rolling loads than static recrystallization as dynamic 
recrystallization does not remove dislocation as effec-

tively as static recrystallization. At low strain rates, low 
flow stress indicates low dislocation density and slow 
softening owing to low driving force and vice versa. 
Incremental stress strain curves (figures 1 and 2) depict 
variation of stress levels interrupted during holding times 
as exists in rod, strip, bar and plate rolling mills. The 
differences being in the amount of deformation strain, 
strain rates, interpass times and rolling temperatures. 
Deformation activation energy, Qdef, is ~ 312–330 kJ/ 
mol. Apparent activation energy for metadynamic recry-
stallization, Qapp (mdrx) is ~ 50 kJ/mol. Activation energy 
for both static and metadynamic recrystallization is 
~ 300 kJ/mol. 
 Figure 3 shows the variation of peak stresses with 
different temperatures and strain rates for ENIA steel. As 
expected, peak stresses reduced with increasing tempe-
rature but increased with increasing strain rate. 
 Similar trends can be observed for the 3 steels in figure 4 
as Zener–Hollomon parameter, Z, increases. EN24 steel, 
however, exhibited a rise in peak stress for increasing 
strain rate, with the highest peak stress of 170 MPa obtai-
ned at 900°C, with a strain rate of 0⋅05 s– 1. This could be 
due to the higher C content and traces of Cr, Ni and Mo 
in this steel. Experimental values (table 2), of peak strain 
measured during tests are superimposed on calculated 
values in figure 5. For ENIA steel experimental values of 
0⋅55 at 800°C, 0⋅05/s strain rate, and 0⋅2 at 1100°C, 
0⋅05/s strain rate have been superimposed in the figure. 
Experimental values were higher than calculated ones  
but incremental trend was similar in both. The initial  
grain sizes in these steels are higher than the 50 µm 
assumed for theoretical calculations. Similar trends have 
been observed by other authors (Sellars 1979; Hodgson 
1997).

3.2 Static softening (Xrec) 
Holding time between passes was only 0⋅5 s as the tests 
were meant to simulate ring or rod rolling. From the 
calculated values of t50 for three steels, with 50 µm initial 
grain size, static t50 was 24 s for ENIA at 0⋅051 strain and 
6⋅05 s for EN2 and EN24 at 0⋅072 strain, with tempe-
rature at 1373 K. Experimental t50 values were 26 s and 
9 s, respectively for the same conditions. They are con-
sistently higher than the theoretical ones. Using Avrami 
equation relating softening to t50, 
 
  Xrec = 1 – exp{– 0⋅639 [t/t50%]n}. 
 
 Calculated softening (X = 0⋅004 for ENIA, and 0⋅025 
for EN2 and EN24 steels at 1100°C) is less than 10% for 
0⋅5 s holding time and this is more likely to be recovery 
rather than recrystallization softening. For interrupted 
tests with large numbers of passes, strain will be retained 
at the end of each pass and total strain accumulation will 
exceed the critical strain needed for dynamic recrystalli-
zation to take place. 
3.3 Critical and peak strain (εp) 
Calculated peak strain values are shown in table 3 using 
Sellars (1979) equation, 
 
  εp= 4⋅9 × 10– 4 × d0 Z0⋅15, 
 
for 50 µm initial grain size, and at different strain rates. 
Peak strain increased from 0⋅133 to 0⋅15 for all steels 
with increase in strain rate from 0⋅05/s to 0⋅12/s. These 
trends were evidenced in the stress–strain curves (figures 
1–2), with experimental peak strain values. 
 Calculations using (Sellars 1979) equation and experi-
mental values of peak strain for ENIA steel, are shown  
in figure 6 for increasing Z. Experimental values were 
slightly higher than calculated ones but both showed 
linear gradual increment with increasing Z. These trends 
have been widely reported (Djaic and Jonas 1973; Sellars 
1979; Hodgson 1997).

 When there is insufficient time for static recrysta-
llization to take place between multiple passes, work 
hardening or ‘strain’ is accumulated from pass to pass 
until it attains and then exceeds the peak strain associated 
with the initiation of dynamic recrystallization. Also since 
interpass time is short, there can be no strain induced 
precipitation, hence no pancaking, so only dynamic re-
crystallization occurs. So interpass time is very crucial 
and determines what types of processes take place. 
 Dynamic recrystallization can take place below Tnr 
provided the interpass time is too short for strain induced 
precipitation to take place and hence also no pancaking. 
Strain accumulation is assumed to be under the uniform 
softening approach. This assumes that all grains behave 
homogeneously and the residual strain can be calculated 
from the recrystallized fraction, X. 
 At 1100°C, 0⋅5 s holding time, 0⋅05/s strain rate, 
softening X for ENIA steel is 0⋅004. Retained strain, 
using equation above, at end of 1st pass is 0⋅051. Peak 
strain for ENIA for the same conditions is 0⋅2 (table 2) 
and dynamic recrystallization occurs at 0⋅8 of peak strain, 
which is 0⋅16. Retained strain at end of 3rd pass is 0⋅153. 
Therefore, dynamic recrystallization will occur at the 
start of 4th pass and metadynamic recrystallization at the 
start of 8th pass for ENIA steel. 
 For EN2 and EN24 steels, and same conditions as for 
ENIA steel, softening X is 0⋅025. Retained strain at end 
of 1st pass is 0⋅07. Peak strain, for same conditions, is 
0⋅2 (table 2) and dynamic recrystallization occurs at 0⋅8 
of peak strain, which is 0⋅16. Retained strain at end of 
2nd pass is 0⋅14. Therefore, dynamic recrystallization 
will occur at beginning of the 3rd pass and metadynamic 
recrystallization at the beginning of 6th pass for EN2 and 
EN24 steels. 
3.5 Dynamic softening (Xdyn) 
Increase in strain rate significantly reduces the recrysta-
llization times for similar temperatures. Strain rates 
below 0⋅01/s was avoided in these tests to avoid exce-
ssively low recrystallization rates due to low driving 
force. Hence, value of Avrami exponent 1⋅7 was used for 
metadynamic recrystallization. Avrami fits for softening

graphs showed that the value was accurate. Softening in 
the metadynamic recrystallization region is largely inde-
pendent of temperature, strain and composition. Softe-
ning proceeds at much faster rate than in static 
recrystallization. 
 Figure 7 shows the metadynamic recrystallization kine-
tics for the 3 steels, using data from table 4. Holding time 
was 0⋅5 s. As expected, metadynamic recrystallization 
times were much smaller than the static times but increased 
with decrease in temperature. Fractional softening decrea-
sed from 0⋅27 to 0⋅126 for ENIA when temperature 
dropped from 1373 to 1073 K and recrystallization times 
increased correspondingly from 0⋅75 s to 1⋅25 s. 
 Figure 8 extracted from Hodgson (1997) show such a 
similar trend in variation between fractional softening, X 
and time for different temperatures. A rise from 0⋅07 s to 
0⋅9 s recrystallization time, in the temperature range 900–
1200°C was accompanied by change in softening from 
0⋅1 to 1. 
 Figure 9 from Hodgson (1997) supports such a similar 
trend in variation between fractional softening, X and 
time for different strain rates. As strain rate increased 
from 0⋅03/s to 3/s, a corresponding reduction in time 
from 10 s to 0⋅1 s was observed for fractional softening 0⋅5. 
 The extracted figures show similar deductions as in the 
present work (Sellars 1979; Hodgson 1997).

3.6 Dynamic recrystallization grain size (ddyn) 
Dynamic recrystallization occurs in many hot deforma-
tion processes such as early roughing passes during hot 
rolling, or in some hot forging and extrusion processes 
and seam less tube rolling. ddyn decreases with decreasing 
temperature and increasing strain rates. Initial grain size 
and strain has no effect. Dynamic recrystallization is 
related to strain rate and temperature by Sellars (1979) 
equation 
 
  ddyn = 1⋅6⋅104 Z– 0⋅23. 
 Since holding time between passes is only 0⋅5 s and 
static fractional softening, X is less than 10%, it is 
evident that strain will accumulate from pass to pass. 
Summary of the values of metadynamically recrystallized 
grain sizes are also given in table 5 for different strain 
rates. Calculations were made by using Sellars (1979) 
equation. Notice that strain rate has a very significant 
effect on these recrystallized grain sizes. ddyn for ENIA 
reduced from 72 µm to 57 µm as a result of increase in 
strain rate from 0⋅05 to 0⋅12/s. Metadynamic grain sizes 
were higher than dynamically recrystallized grain sizes 
since metadynamically recrystallized grains grow from 
existing dynamically formed nuclei without incubation 
time. 
 These trends are evident in figure 10 showing ddyn and 
metadynamically recrystallized grain sizes as functions 
of Zener–Hollomon parameter, Z. Notice the linear  
decline in grain size with increasing Z values for both 
dynamic as well as metadynamic recrystallization. 
 Grain refinement in dynamic and metadynamic re-
crystallization has limitations but is better than static

recrystallization refinement. Higher strain rates also lead 
to better refinement in both dynamic and metadynamic 
recrystallization. 
 Figure 11 extracted from Hodgson (1997), shows such 
a similar trend in variation between grain size and Zener–
Hollomon, Z, for dynamic recrystallization. Metadynamic 
recrystallization occurred at higher values of Z and had 
higher grain size values of around 10 µm over those of 
dynamically recrystallized grain sizes. 
3.7 Metadynamic recrystallization time (t50 meta) 
Figure 12 shows effect of temperature and strain rate on 
calculated metadynamic t50. Exponent was 1⋅36 for both 
temperature and the three steels. Higher t50 meta. were 
also obtained for lower finishing temperatures as expec-
ted. As strain is increased beyond the peak strain, εp, 
strain no longer has significant effect on t50 values. 
Between 0⋅051 and εp value of 0⋅2, strain increments 
resulted in rapidly decreasing t50 but strain rate has no 
effect. The reverse occurs beyond εp. Sellars (1979) 
equation, 
 
  t0⋅5 = 1⋅06 × 10– 5 Z– 0⋅6 exp(300000/RT), 
 
was used to calculate metadynamic t50 values. When 
temperature is 1100°C and strain rate, 0⋅05 s– 1, t50 was 
1⋅25 s. t50, however, was 0⋅75 s for all 3 steels at strain 
rate of 0⋅12 s– 1. For the same conditions, experimental 
values for metadynamic t50 were 1⋅53 and 1⋅04 s, respec-

tively. At 800°C, however, experimental metadynamic t50 
was 14 s at 0⋅05/s strain rate and 11⋅2 s at 0⋅12/s strain 
rate. These experimental values have been inserted in 
figure 12 above for comparison. They are consistently 
higher than the theoretical ones. 
 It was found that the rate of softening was largely 
independent of temperature (figures 7 and 12), a strong 
function of strain rate (figure 9) and a weak function of 
composition (Hodgson 1997) (figures 7 and 12), although 
the weak composition dependence probably only exists at 
high temperatures. This is quite the opposite from static 
recrystallization where the rate of recrystallization in 
austenite is primarily affected by temperature, strain, and 
grain size with little effect from strain rate. Similar rea-
soning have been deduced by other authors (Sellars 1979; 
Hodgson 1997). 
4. Conclusions 
(I) Metadynamic recrystallization (at strains higher than 
critical strain) displayed strong function of strain rate and 
very weak function of temperature and strain. 
(II) It significantly refined austenite grain size prior to 
transformation. 
(III) Avrami exponent of 1⋅7 was used for metadynamic 
recrystallization. 
(IV) Strain rate of less than 0⋅01 s– 1 was avoided during 
experimentation, to ensure complete softening under pre-
vailing metadynamic conditions.
